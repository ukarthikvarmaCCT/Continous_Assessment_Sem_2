 When Aishwarya's Purple Lips, Big B, got viral in Cannes, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been attending Cannes red carpet for years
 aishwarya ne hameshaa se is international festival main apni khubsuurati ke jalwe bikhere hai
 But there have also been many times when Aishwarya's look was ridiculed on social media
 do saal pehle aishwarya raay bachchan jab kans ke red karpet par ai thim to unke geoup se zyada purple lipstick charchaa main thi
 At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, Aishwarya wore an off shoulder gown
 lekin unke purple lipstic shed ne surkhiyaan batorin

 It is reported that the makers have approached MTV Roadies star Navjot Gurudutt for the reality show
 navjot gurudutt peshey se bijnesaman hai
 He is the founder of the Fame Manager Company
 charchaa ye bhi he ki MTV rodies ke jaj ranvijay singh ko bhi big bos ke liye approach kiya gaya he
 But there is no confirmation from his side yet
 big bos kaa pichhlaa sijan kaaphi hit rahaa tha
 Sreesanth, Deepika Kakkar Ibrahim, Deepak Thakur put the show in the spotlight
 sijan 13 ke liye mekars ko aise contestants kii talash he jo sho ko bharpoor masala de sake
 It is reported on the front page of a newspaper that the country's Reserve Bank of India did not agree on the decision of demonetisation
 notebandi ke dhai ghante pehle tak bhi is nirnay par sawaal kiye gaye the or shankaa jataai gai thi ki jis lakshya ko lekar yah faisla liya ja rahaa he vah isse hasil nahin hoga! yani kaala dhan ke lautne par ashanka jataai gai thi
 An application under the Right to Information Act in the Reserve Bank of India has once again come to the fore during the election
 haalanki mukhyadhara ke akhabaaron ne is khabar ko koi khaas tavajjo nahin di
 When the RBI did not agree, then what were the reasons that led to such a decision? Was that report of the Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata behind this decision, which said that in 2014-15, forged currency notes of Rs 411 crore were in circulation inside India
 desh main bade paimaane par chal rahe in jaali noton or asli noton main fark karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa tha or bade noton ke marfat desh main kaala dhan jamaa kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, it was very important to take this decision
 nishchit hi yah bharat kii arthvyavastha ke liye jaruri tha bhi to kya iske liye puri taiyaari thi? jis tarah se ise lagu kiya gaya, uski to anant kathaayen desh bhar main hai hi lekin ab jabaki chunaavon ko bigul baj gaye hai or tamaam mudde rahakrurah kar twitor ke hashtag main trend kiye or karaae ja rahe hai tab yah sawaal uthanaa bhi lajimi he ki is sarkaar ke sabase bade faislon main se ek notebandi kaa hasil kya he? kya vah mahaj sarkaar kii jid thi, yaa vaaki ek sahi faisla jisase vah sabakuch hasil kar liya gaya he, jiskaa daawa kiya ja rahaa tha
 If demonetisation has been successful, then obviously it will also be seen in the banner poster in this election, as this achievement started appearing in the banner-poster somewhere after the successful return of our reception
 lekin itane saalon baad bhi koi aisa umdaa poster kisi bhi madhyam par hamen nahin dikhaa he, jisamen vimudrikaran ko mahimamandit kiya gaya ho
 If you see it somewhere, then definitely tweet
 yahi nahin notebandi ke prabhaavon ke liye desh main koi thik thaak adhyayan hi karwaane kii jarurat nahin samajhi gai
 In a information given in the Lok Sabha, the Minister of State for Finance said that while the number of counterfeit notes in the country was 632926 in 15-16, 762072 in 2016-17, it decreased to 522783 in 2017-18
 is jaankaree kaa matlab to yah he ki notebandi ke baad bhi 522783 adad jaali note desh main notebandi ke baad bhi pakad main aae
 Another major achievement was also reported which revealed that in the months after demonetisation, about 900 groups were raided by the Income Tax Department and seized assets worth over 900 crores
 7900 karod rupee kii aghoshit aay kaa bhi pataa chalaa
 By November 17, 360 more groups were searched and assets worth 700 crores and income of about 10 thousand crores was revealed
 sawaal yah he ki puure desh ko line main khadaa karne ke vikalp ke alaava kya koi vikalp tha, jisase yah taxchori kaa yah khel kaa khulaasa ho paata
 The Income Tax Department has its own capable structure in the country
 kya yah ek vikalp ho saktaa tha ki sarkaar is kaabil dhaanche ko bhi sena kii tarah hi kaam karne ko kahati or aise tamaam choron kaa kaala chittha saamne aa paata
 Could it not also be that the government would have increased its numbers by surgical strikes on such fugitives from the country, which would have made their claim to form the government again
 landan kii galiyon main pichley dinon tahaltey paae gaye akele neerav modi hi is puri notebandi ke hasil baraabar yani takreeban 11 hajaar karod rupee kaa dhan dakaar ke baithe hai
 After demonetisation, the government will not be able to forget the claim of breaking the backbone of terrorism financially, because after the attack of Pulwama, it will reverse the heart and mind of the voters of the country
 ab dhire-dhire jab adarsh aachaar samhita kii chaaya main desh duniya ke sabase bade loktantr kaa pradhanmantri yaa pradhansevak chunegaa tab yah sawaal barkrubar aaenge ki janata chune to kise chune or chunane kaa aadhaar kya ho? kya vah notebandi ke dard ko pulavama hamale ke baad pakistan ko die gaye jawaab se santusht hogi yaa phir use bhi notebandi kii tarah hi dabe man se shankaa kii najaron se dekhegi?desh kii suraksha ke maamalon main desh kii janata ko kisi par bhi koi shankaa nahin he
 There is also no mistrust
 lekin yah bhi sahi baat he ki jis tarah se raajnneeti ne samaaj main apni pratishtha ko rasaatal tak gira liya he or koi charkrupanch baras se nahin, dashakon se loktantr main 'lok se tantra' kii khai badhati gai he, usne janata ke vishwaas ko hilaakar bhi rakh diya he
 That is why a person's tongue can be silenced, but the questions raised in his mind must be answered
 isliye nahin ki vah maanga ja rahaa he, isliye nahin ki koi sawaal kar rahaa he, isliye kyonki bharat jaise loktantric samaaj main abhi yah gunjaaish puri tarah se bachi hui he or loktantr par is bharose ko banaae rakhana lokpratinidhiyon kii saakh ko banaae rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he ki vah sab kuch un logon ko bataaya jaae jo logon ke man main he
 Let him not be tricked by the juggernaut of words
 notebandi bhi ek aisa hi sawaal he
 It will have to be seen how the government takes this issue forward to protect itself and whether the opposition is able to surround the government in the Lok Sabha elections through the latest information of RBI? adhiktar logon ko lagata he ki kisi bhi vyakti ke dressing sens or baat karne ke tareeke se hi unke swabhaav kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you there, the style of walking of a person also shows a lot about his personality
 aaie jaanate hai aapke chalane kaa style aapke bare main kya kahata he
 
 
 
 jaldi chalanaagar koi vyakti jaldi-jaldi chalata he to isse andaja lagaaya jaataa he ki us vyakti ko kahin jaldi pahunchnaa he
 But usually people who have a habit of walking frequently are very energetic
 jaldi chalane vaale logon main confident bharpoor hota he
 These people are very courageous
 duusare logon se ummid karte hai ki wo bhi unke saath jaldi-jaldi hi chalem
 These 5 major disadvantages occur to the body by not having breakfast
 Walking slowly, people who do not have any worries in life, they walk slowly
 ye log swabhaav se bahut shant hote hai
 Dragging feet Those people who walk dragged on the ground get angry quickly
 ye log swabhaav se behad utsahit rahete hai or kisi bhi baat se jaldi niraash ho jate hai
 Walking quietly People who walk silently, they are quite shy by nature
 in logon main aatm-sammaan kii kami hoti he
 Silent walkers are often advised to walk briskly to look confident
 sehat-chalane ke tareeke se sirf vyaktitv or swabhaav kaa hi pataa nahin lagata he, balki aapke chalane kaa andaaj aapaki sehat ke bare main bhi kai raaj kholta he

 An image of CBSE Board's English textbook 'together with English' is going viral on Twitter, showing a passage full of praise of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and then questions related to it
 bacchon ko english sikhaane ke makasad se taiyaar is paisej main rahul or gandhi parivaar ke duusare sadasyon kii chatukaarita ke andaaj main tarif kii gai he or phir kuch aise sawaal puche gaye hai ki rahul gandhi ne kis tarah se desh ko chamatkrit kiya
 Leave it to the miracle, however, the comments that the people of the country are making after seeing this picture, the Congress seems to be disheartened

 Many skeptics were wondering how this young man, who spent most of his life in Britain and America, would walk the bumpy paths of Indian politics

 He has shown confidence and seriousness in politics

 dilli se sate haryana ke ek gaanv main wadra ne jis shaks se jameen kharidi thi, use hi badi keemat par wo jameen bech di thi
 The question of this money transaction has started smoldering till the Parliament
 haryana main hamaare samvaadadaata ashish maharishi ne padtaal kii
 Robert Vadra bought land at Amipur village, just 30 km from Delhi, at a very cheap price and then sold it at a higher price
 yaheen par robert wadra ne ek hi shaks harbans laal paahwa se chaar-chaar jameen saude kiye
 In Amipur village of Faridabad district in Haryana, Vadra bought a total of 46 acres of land and then sold it to Pahwa at a high price
 in sabhi saudon main haryana ceiling on land holdings act, 1972 kaa sidhaa ulanghan hua
 Aaj Tak's investigation proved how money transactions took place in the name of legitimate land deals
 8 sitambar 2005 ko robert wadra ne faridabad jile ke amipur gaanv ke harbans laal paahwa se 12 acre jameen kharidi
 a little over Rs 32 lakh was paid for this
 14 april 2006 ko robert wadra ne paahwa se hi 30 lakh rupee main or das acre jameen kharidi
 And the third deal, on 13 January the same year, Vadra bought 19 acres of land in Amipur village from Harbans Lal Pahwa
 is baar 54 lakh rupee par
 And on April 28, 2006, Vadra's wife Priyanka Gandhi signed a 5-acre deal from Pahwa in Amipur village for Rs 15 lakh
 jameen kaa ye sauda kanoon kaa ulanghan he, kyonki wadra dampati ne jo 46 acre jameen kharidi he, wo haryana ceiling on land holdings act 1972 ke tahat adhiktam jameen rakhane kii kshamta se kahin bahut zyada he
 26 more than one man or one family in Haryana
 9 acre kheti laayak jameen rakhane kii ijaajat he, jis jameen par kam se kam ek fasal paidaa hoti ho
 Or a family with three children is allowed to own the same amount of land
 ye naa sirf land ceiling act kaa ulanghan he, balki paison kaa aisa ajeeb len-dein kaa maamla he, jisamen wadra ne usee shaks ko jameen bech di, jisase kharidi thi
 The 46 acres were sold to land dealer Harbans Lal Pahwa at double price and in three installments
 is tarah paanch saal se bhi kam samay main bechney vaala kharidaar ban gaya or kharidne vaala vikreta
 Till date, there are documents on how Robert Vadra bought 46 acres of land in Amipur village in Haryana, in violation of the Land Ceiling Act
 rabart wadra ne usee harbans paahwa se jameen kharidi, jisaki company ne jameen ke liye lone diya
 Three years later, Vadra sold the same land to Pahwa at double the price
 ajtak ne is masale par rigerv bank of india ke purv diarector vipin malik se baat kii, jo bade-bade tex maamalon ko dekhte rahe hai
 Malik says that the matter is much more than what is seen in these land deals
 sawaal ye he ki paahwa or robert wadra ke bich kya rishta he, jisase ki donon ne ek duusare se jameen kharidne or phir bechney kaa ajibo-garib kaam kiya
 This whole puzzle opened up when Aaj Tak's Special Investigation Team combed all the wires related to Vadra's business
 wadra ke balance shits ko dekhte hue hamaari najar ek karod 55 lakh rupee par atak gayi or ek baar phir yahaan harbans laal paahwa kaa naam tha
 Documents show that Pahwa's company- Carnival Intercontinental Estate Pvt Ltd loaned Rs 1 crore 55 lakh to Vadra's company 'skylight Hospitality'
 wadra kii company real arth main 18 farvari 2008 se 23 march 2009 tak paahwa diarector rahe
 But if senior lawyer KTS Tulsi believes, Vadra may also get the benefit of doubt in this land deal
 ajtak ne harbans laal paahwa se gudgaanv sthit unke ghar main milane kii koshish kii
 The team wanted to get details of his dealings with Vadra
 ajtak ke paas rabart wadra or harbans laal paahwa ke bich kaarobaari rishton ke bhi dastaveji saboot hai
 The balance sheet of Vadra's company clearly shows that Vadra took a loan of one crore 55 lakh from Harbans Lal Pahwa
 vahi paahwa jo wadra kii company real arth main ek saal se bhi zyada samay tak diarector rahe
 According to the experts with whom we talked, many questions arise about the methods of money transaction, which should be investigated

 bhartiya dand samhita yani ipisi kii dhara 403 or 120B ke tahat aisa karnaa jurm he
 In one such case, a couple in Tirupur, Tamil Nadu got a three-year jail term
 darasal, saal 2012 main gunasakaran or unki patni radha ke khate main 40 lakh rupee aa gaye the, to unhone na hi yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki unke khate main paise kaise aae or na hi is paise ko lautaane ke liye koi kadam uthaaya
 He took this money out of the account and spent it
 unhone is paise se ghar kharida or beti kii shaadi main kharch kar daale
 However, he could not escape the long hand of the law and now after seven years, he has been sentenced to three years in jail
 tirupur kii nichali adaalat ne donon ko teen saal jail kii sajaa sunai he
 Actually, this money was released for civil work under MP Local Area Development Scheme and MLA Local Area Development Scheme
 ye paise public works department ke agxcutive ejeeniyar ke khate main jane the, lekin galati se gunasakaran ke khate main chale gaye
 After this Gunasakaran remained silent and did not give any information about it
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagane kii koshish bhi nahin kii ki aakhir unke khate main 40 lakh rupee kaise aae
 According to the case filed in Rajcourt, opened 8 months later, Gunaskaran has a savings account with Corporation Bank located in Tirupur
 isi bank main public works department ke agxcutive ejeeniyar kaa bhi khaataa he
 40 lakhs went wrongly into Gunasakran's account instead of Executive Engineer's account
 dilachasp baat yah he ki isaki jaankaree public works department ko 8 maheene tak nahin chali ki paisa kisi duusare ke khate main chalaa gaya he
 When the Public Works Department feared not getting the Rs 40 lakh account, he spoke to the bank officials
 iske baad unhone bataaya ki public works department ne jis khate main paisa transfar karne ko kaha tha, usee khate main paisa transfar kar diya gaya he
 After this, when it was carefully checked, it was found that Rs 40 lakh had gone into Gunaskaran's account
 itnaa hi nahin, jab tak yah maamla saamne aayaa, tab tak gunasakaran puure paise ko khate se nikaal chuke the or kharch karne main jute the
 After this, senior officials of the bank were asked to return the money to Gunaskaran, but they did not deposit the money
 ipisi ke tahat sunai gai sajiske baad bank ke assistant general manager narsimha giri ne gunasakaran ke khilaaf tirupur city ke central krime branch police main shikaayat darj karai
 In this case, a case was registered against Gunaskaran under sections 403 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code i

 cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkarne aupchaarik taur par ghoshnaa kii he ki tivi vigyapanon main abhinay karte vakt ve abhinayta hai, na ki cricket khilaadi
 About 2 crores on income from TV advertisements
 kaa iskar bachaane ke lietendulkarne iskar tribunel ko bataaya ki vigyaapan filmon main unka pesha abhinay he, cricket nahin
 The tribunal also accepted his argument that he was an actor, as he had to use his acting abilities, imagination and creativity to work in advertisements
 tendulkar par 2001-02 or 2004-05 main iespien star sports, pepsico or visa se videshi mudra main hone vaali 5,92,31,211 ru
 2,08,59,707 on earnings of Rs
 kaa tex lagaaya gaya tha
 He challenged the order of Commissioner of Income tax-appeal (CIT-A)
 20 may ke ek aadesh main tribunel ne faisla sunaaya ki tendulkar ek kalakaar ke taur par apni modelling se hone vaali aay par chhot paane kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 Tendulkar claimed income tax exemption under Section 80 RR of the Income Tax Act
 is dhara main kaha gaya he ki koi bhi vyakti agar naatakkaar, kalakaar, sangeetkaar, abhinayta yaa khilaadi he or vah apane peshey se koi aay arjeet karata he to us aay par vah iskar main chhot kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 When the Assessing Officer asked Tendulkar to disclose his profession, Master Blaster stated in his submitted paper that, "he is a well-known model and acts in advertisements for products of various companies
" '' unhone kaha ki abhinay se hone vaali aay ko vyapaar or peshey se hone vaali aay dikhaaya gaya tha jabaki cricket se hone vaali aay ko anya stroton se hone vaali aay bataaya gaya tha, kyonki ve gaiyr-peshewar cricket khilaadi hai
 Tendulkar said that income tax exemption was claimed on the basis of his acting profession
 akalan adhikari ne tendulkar ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya or peshewar shabd kaa arth jaanane ke liye vah shabdkosh dekhne laga
 The official found that it is correct to say that cricket is his source of living and hence it is his profession
 usne aage kaha ki, ''sachin agar cricket khilaadi nahin hai to cricket khilaadi koun ho saktaa he
 He wrote that Tendulkar has received remuneration for providing all kinds of services to these companies
 in companiyon ke saath kiye gaye anubandh main ullikhit vibhinn gatividhiyon kaa unke abhinayta hone ke daawey se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Therefore, the officer said that his claim is not correct
 tendulkar ne in companiyon ke saath naam, photo, moulik aawaaj, pahanava, juute kaa upyog karne, utpaada ke pravaktaa kii bhoomika karne or media main dikhaai dene ke liye anubandh kiya he
 The officer wrote, "it is true that to appear in ad films, Tendulkar has to wear certain type of clothing and follow the script as per the director
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ve abhinayta hai
 In all the advertisements he appears in, he is portrayed as a cricket figure
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki jo company tendulkar ko apane vigyaapan main leti he, vah unka istemaal isliye karti he ki ve cricket ke diggaj sachin tendulkar hai
 When his claim was rejected, Tendulkar claimed that he should be considered an artist under Section 80RR
 unhone kaha ki kalakaar kaa matlab vigyapanon ke anubandhon kii sharton ke anusaar nikaala jaae
 But CIT-A did not accept this argument
 usne faisla sunaaya-tendulkar mukhya rup se cricket khilaadi hai or is baat ko darkinar karte hue ki ve peshewar hai yaa nahin, yah baat par vivaad se pare he ki unka pesha cricket khelnaa he
 Tendulkar is not paid for his work as an actor or artist
 unke abhinay ke swabhaav or quality yaa kalakaar ke rup main unke kaam se unhen ye anubandh kabhi nahin milte or na hi unhen milane vaale paise
 Tendulkar filed an appeal against this decision
 tribunel kii ore se amitabh bachchan ko iskar main di gai chhot ke ek faisle se tendulkar ke maamle main madad mili
 In 2004, the tribunal ruled that income taxed as a presenter of Kaun Banega Crorepati could be exempted from income tax under Section 80RR as he used his qualifications as an artist in this TV show
 tribunel kii nyaayik sadsy aashaa vijayraghavan or accountint sadsy aar
 K
 panda ne faisla diya-''vigyapanon main kaam karte samay tendulkar ko liton or camera kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 As a model, he uses his imagination, creativity and ability to combine all elements in such a way that he can influence human sensations and emotions and also has an aesthetic feeling
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki ek safal khilaadi hone ke naate model ke rup main unka brands mahatv bad jaataa he
 But it is the reality that they have to use their acting ability, imagination and creativity
 har khilaadi main lite or camera kaa saamana karne main us str kii pratibha, yogyata yaa rachanaatmakataa nahin hoti he
 Income from modeling and advertising and other such activities can be seen as income from an artist's profession
 ''tendulkar ne apane karmchaariyon par hone vaale kalyankari kharch, jisamen unki chaay or naashte kaa kharch bhi shaamil he, kii mad main 57,969 ru
 , 50,000-50,000 as entertainment expenses and telephone expenses
 or car par kharch ke rup main 1,42,824 ru
 The taxable income deduction was also claimed but the tribunal rejected it
 uskaa kahana tha ki telephone, car or bhojan kaa kharch unke or unke parivaar ke liye tha
 Tendulkar, who has recorded almost all the batting records, has left himself behind in this work

 These include Rajesh Lilothia, acting president of Delhi Congress, Anil Chaudhary, women Congress president Sumitra Chauhan, Poonam Prabhakar in charge of Telangana, Virendra Rathore in charge of Bihar, Srinivas, vice president of Youth Congress, Deepak Babaria in charge of Madhya Pradesh and Girish Chaudhankar in charge of Goa
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki inamen se adhikansh netaa jald hi congress party ke sanghathan sachiv ke si venugopal se mulaakaat karenge
 Bhawana Nata d'souza, general secretary of Mahila Congress, said emotionally that Rahul Gandhi gave the people of general background, non-political background a chance and allowed them to advance in the party
 unhone jimmedaari (loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii) lekar party adhyaksh ke pad se istipha diya he to hamaara bhi naitik daayitv banataa he ki unke saath khadey hon
 The meeting of the Congress leaders who resigned together on the future strategy lasted till late night
 ab ye netaa congress ke sanghathanaatmak sachiv ke si venugopal se milenge
 Earlier, there was a stir among the Congress leaders, as some young leaders were engaged in a signature campaign to resign
 haalanki is patr main abhi tak mahasachiv str ke kisi netaa kaa hastakshar nahin dikhaa he
 It is believed that leaders of the new and old generation should have two types of opinions on this issue
 jaahir he istife kii is muhim ko lekar party main sabhi sahamat nahin hai
 a senior Congress leader who is not ready to reveal his name expressed concern over what Rahul Gandhi had said
 unhone kaha ki ab congress adhyaksh ne istipha de diya he to hamen kise istipha dena he
 The mass resignations in the Congress will lead to anarchy
 chunaavon main karaari haar ke baad se sabhi rajyon main sanghathan main bade paimaane par pherbadal kiye ja rahe hai
 At least some things should be allowed to run
 mukhyamantriyon ke istife se congress shasit rajyon main sarkarein asthir ho jaaengi
 What will we gain from this? However, since the defeat in the elections, there is still a sense of despair, and there is no hope of recovering from it
 bhram kii vajah se sattarudh dal ke netaaon ko congress par tanj kasne kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Another Congress leader said that there is a need to create a framework to know the reasons for the defeat in every constituency as the reasons for the defeat are different in each parliamentary constituency
 haar kii samiksha main lanbaa samay nahin lenaa chahie
 If it took a long time, people would forget us
 party main pratishthit padon ko lekar pehle se hi paanch sitara hotalon main band daravaajein kii baithken ho rahi hai
 At the same time, many leaders are vocal about the new option and they believe that the party's image is being damaged due to the current dilemma
 anand sharma, mallikarjun khadge, ashok gahalot, sachin payalat or yahaan tak ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ke naam ko lekar bhi tamaam tarah kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 However, it is clear that Rahul Gandhi is firm on his decision to resign from the party president and the party will have to take steps soon to overcome the current situation

 On April 10, Delhi will vote for the Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan loksabhaa kii 7 or vidhansabha kii 70 siten hai
 In the December 2013 assembly elections, BJP got 31 seats, Congress 8 and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) 28 seats
 agar pichley teen maah main teenon partiyon kii lokapriyata apni jagah barkaraar rahati to us hisaab se bijepi or aap ko teen-teen or congress ko ek seat milani chahie thi
 But the India Today Group and Cicero opinion polls conducted between 1,200 voters on 27 to 28 March show BJP getting 6 out of 7 seats
 congress ko agar ek seat mil jaati he to use khud ko khushkismat maananaa chahie
 Similarly, you may have to satisfy yourself on one seat
 har sample main anischitata kaa tatv maujuud rahata he, isliye is anumaan main ek seat kaa her-pher ho saktaa he
 In Delhi, loyalty to a party lasts for nearly a decade
 iske baad vah duusari party kii ore tabdeel ho jaati he
 The 1980s were the Congress's and the 1990s the bjp's
 iske baad disambar, 2013 tak congress phir se dilliwaalon kii pasandida party ban gai thi
 In 2004, Delhi sent only one BJP candidate to the Lok Sabha and in 2009 none of its candidates from Delhi could win the Lok Sabha elections
 us saal dilli ne apni sabhi 7 siten congress kii jholii main daal di thim
 While the Congress got more than half of the votes in the 2004 and 2009 elections, the BJP was 14-22 percent behind
 2004 se 2009 ke bich bijepi ke voton kaa pratishat 41 se girakar 35 ho gaya tha
 In 2009, the margin of victory of the Congress in five Lok Sabha seats was more than 20 percent and in the other two seats it was 10 percent
 isse pataa chalata he ki congress ko kitni badi jeet mili thi
 By the end of 2013, the Congress was away from Delhiites
 yah duuri shaayad 2012 kii shuruyaat main hi aa gai thi, jab nagar nigam chunaav hue the
 In the December 2013 assembly elections, Delhi voters almost completely broke with the Congress
 congress kaa vot pratishat apane sabase nichle str yani 25 pratishat par pahunch gaya tha
 His performance has never been worse since independence
 bijepi kaa vot pratishat 33 pratishat par atak gaya or arvind kejariwal ke netritv main aap ko 29 pratishat vot mili
 By winning 28 out of 70 seats in Delhi assembly elections, AAP had worried both BJP and Congress
 disambar, 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle tak dilli main do hi pramukh partiyaan thim-bijepi or congress
 Although there were other parties and independent candidates like Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Janata Dal (secular), they did not have much interference in electoral mathematics
 saat loksabhaa siton ke liye kul 160 ummidavaaron main se 14 (congress or bijepi ke 7-7) ko chhod sabhi kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 According to the opinion poll, this time there is no longer a fight between the two parties, but this battle has now become triangular mainly between AAP, BJP and Congress
 mamata banerjee kii tiemasi ke chaar pratyaashiyon, samet baaki sabhi pratyaashiyon kii jamaanat jabt ho sakati he
 Opinion polls show that Congress troubles in Delhi have not diminished
 bijepi phir se dilliwaalon kii pasand ban gai he
 Since the last assembly elections, there has been a tilt of eight percent votes in favor of the BJP, while the Congress vote percentage has decreased by two percent
 aap ke vot pratishat main bhi dedh pratishat kii kami aati dikhti he
 The BJP is looking even stronger in the four Lok Sabha seats in central Delhi and areas across the Yamuna
 bahari dilli kii teen loksabhaa siton par aap kii lokapriyata apekshaakrit barkaraar he
 The number of urban and semi-urban voters is more here
 bijepi ne sirf ek ko chhodkar 2009 ke apane sabhi pratyaashiyon ko badal diya he
 Ramesh Bidhuri, who lost in 2009 by less than one lakh votes to Congress candidate Ramesh Kumar from South Delhi, has been renominated
 baaki ke sabhi pratyaashee apekshaakrit nae chehre hai, jinase bijepi ko phayda ho saktaa he
 On the other hand, Congress has re-fielded all the seven winning candidates in 2009
 bijepi ko modi lahar kaa bhi phayda ho rahaa he
 In the opinion poll, 44 percent of the voters preferred Modi as the next Prime Minister, while 24 percent named Arvind Kejriwal and 19 percent named Rahul Gandhi
 dilli desh ke baaki hisson ke mukaable kai maamalon main kaaphi aage he
 For example literacy rate here 86
 3 pratishat (2011 kii janaganana) he, jo rashtriya ausat 74 pratishat ke mukaable zyada he
 According to opinion polls, political awareness is also high here - 99 percent of the respondents were aware of the upcoming elections and 82 percent had decided whom they would vote for
 vibhinn janamat sangrahon main dekhi ja rahi modi lahar ko dekhte hue is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki aakhri maukey par votaron kaa jhukaav bijepi ke khilaaf ho jayega
 When the respondents were asked about the second choice, only 3 percent pointed to the Congress while 15 percent referred to the BJP and the AAP as the second choice
 upie-2 ke prati naaraazgi he
 Only 41 percent of the respondents were fully or partially satisfied with its work
 2009 main congress ko vot dene waalon main se kareeb 30 pratishat ne bataaya ki ve ab bijepi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai jabaki lagbhag itane hi pratishat ne aap ke prati samarthan jataayaa
 BJP leader Harsh Vardhan is the first choice as Chief Minister in Delhi
 votaron kii pasand loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main alag-alag he, lekin is pole se pataa chalata he ki aap kii lokapriyata ghati he
 Especially after this party's experience of 49 days of governance
 aap kisi bhi tarah congress kii bi team nahin he kyonki aap ke sambhavit chaar votaron main se kareeb teen ne bataaya ki ve congress kaa saath chhod rahe hai
 In this way, the AAP is hurting the Congress more than the BJP
 bijepi kii lokapriyata sabhi jatiyon, shaikshik varg, vibhinn aay varg or ling varg main he, lekin dharm ke aadhaar par yah alag he
 bjp's popularity among Muslims is far behind its rivals Congress and AAP — only one in six Muslim voters can support BJP
 desh kii kul 543 loksabhaa siton main se dilli main saat siten hai
 The results of Mini India Delhi by population diversity often give a pre-indication of the performance of BJP and Congress at the all-india level
 1991 ko chhod den to 1977 ke baad se sabhi chunaavon main congress ne dilli main acha pradarshan kiye bina akhil bhartiya str par acha pradarshan nahin kiya he
 There can be exceptions at any time, but believe the opinion poll, the story will not be different this time too
 to kya jo party dilli jeetegi, vahi desh par raaj karegi?(lekhak arthshaastri or chunaav vishleshak hai) Former state BJP president DV Sadananda Gowda emerged as an important contender today as the successor to Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa
 mana jaataa he ki yediurppa ne bhaajapa ke kendriya alaakaman ko nae mukhyamantri ke rup main unka naam sujhaayaa
 According to party sources, Yeddyurappa can submit his resignation to the Governor of Karnataka Hansraj Bhardwaj any time after 1 pm today
 iske baad party vidhayak dal kii baithak main unke uttaradhikari kaa chunaav kiya jayega
 Sources said that the potential contenders for the chief minister's post include ministers VS Acharya Jagdish Shettar and Shobha Karandlaje and party general secretary HN Ananth Kumar but Gowda seems to be at the forefront
 yediurppa ne party paryvekshakon arun jetali or rajnath singh se mulaakaat kii or kuch samay tak unase guftgu kii
 Lok Sabha MP Gowda said that with the month of Sawan starting today, the golden days of Karnataka BJP will come
 varsh 2008 main rajya main jab bhaajapa satta main ai to us samay gauda hi rajya ikai ke adhyaksh the
 Due to sympathy stemming from the Janata Dal (S) not transferring power to the BJP under the coalition government, the BJP won the state and Yeddyurappa became the Chief Minister, who elevated the party to the heights in three decades
 is bich yediurppa ko mukhyamantri ke rup main barkaraar rakhane ke liye lobing kar rahe vidhayakon ne sweekaar kar liya he ki unka prayaas safal nahin hua lekin kaha ki vah unke saath rahenge or unke uttaradhikari ke liye unke pasandida vyakti ke liye jor lagaayenge
 Yeddyurappa's camp is pressuring him to make him the president of the state unit, which will have a significant role in ticket distribution in the next election in May 2013
 kendriya bhaajapa se jude sutron ne kaha ki mukhyamantri hone ke naate yediurppa dwaara uttaradhikari ko lekar koi salaah die jane main kuch bhi galat nahin he

 Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi welcomed Biden's statement as 'positive' and 'a step forward'

 is kapade ke bare main likhaa gaya he ki yah ‘bada dikhne kii ichha rakhane vaali ladakiyon ke liye bahut badhiya’ he
 This picture has caused anger among the people

 Why are you linking love with jihad? i say that Muslim society should fix itself
 muslim samaaj ke netaaon ko apane logon ko samajhnaa chahie ki is shabd kaa koi astitv nahin he
 The Hindu society of India is not the same as before, so now they should understand the people of their religion
 yahi hamaara kahana he, nahin to ghatnaayen badhengi, pratikaar hoga
 It was also considered by a judge in Kerala as love jihad when the girl from the judge's house left
 ek saath hajaaron ladkiyaan prem vivaah main aa jaaen to koi to prakriya hogi
 Hence it was named as Jihad, hence Muslim society must fix its direction
 lekin aapaki ore se jehad kehane kaa matlab he ki yah ek suniyojit sajeesh he?jehad kaa matlab he hindustan ke hindu charitra ko samaapt karke islamic desh bananaa
 They consider it to be a crusade to make an Islamic nation without sword, without war, without bloodshed

 It is the work of governments
 60 saal se desh main yah chal rahaa he, karenge jaanch kaa avasar aayega, phir karenge
 Will Modi now demand an inquiry from the government? We are not in a hurry now
 maang karne ko to kabhi bhi kar sakate hai
 Demand does not help, it is necessary to make society aware
 sahmati se shaadi par bhi aapako etraj he?rajamandi ek alag cheez he
 How many incidents of consent are in the country

 We understand the meaning of everything
 hamen etraj dharmantaran se he, aakhir dharmantaran kyon karaate hai
 Darul Uloom, Debband says that it is forbidden to see non-women in their religion with a bad eye, so how can they provoke their people for this
 phir aapkaa yah aarope kyon?dekhie, apane dharm ke logon ko samajhaayen
 We do not believe what Deoband says nor does it mean anything to us
 kisi bhi cese main ve aarope sabit nahin hue jo aap laga rahe hai or na hi prashasan-police yaa sarkaar lav jehad kii baat maan rahi he

 manmohan singh chunaav haar gaye
 Congress is out of power
 unhone aage kaha ki is baat se aap samaj sakate hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dobaaraa chunaav jeetenge yaa nahin
 Because he has got the blessings of Mulayam Singh
 desh ko milane ja rahaa he nayaa pradhanmantri
 
 
 Regarding the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Akhilesh Yadav said that the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress will fight together in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin meri pradhanmantri banane kii ichha nahin he
 Because i believe in making the Prime Minister
 lekin main yah jarur kah saktaa hum ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main desh ko nayaa pradhanmantri milegaa
 SP, BSP, Congress are all together
 
 
 bahujan samaaj party ke saath hue gathbandhan ke sawaal par akhilesh ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ne gathbandhan jarur kiya he, lekin hamaare saath congress, areldi, nishad party samet tamaam dal khadey hai
 We will fight together in the coming election
 har baar uttar pradesh se pradhanmantri banataa aayaa he
 This time also the Prime Minister will come from Uttar Pradesh
 aise bajet kaa kya karnaa jo shaheedon ko 1 karod naa de sake
 
 
 Akhilesh Yadav also attacked the Uttar Pradesh government over the Pulwama attack
 unhone kaha ki pulavama hamale main sabase zyada shahid uttar pradesh se hue hai
 The rest of the governments are giving Rs 1 crore to the martyrs, but the Uttar Pradesh government is not giving money
 upi bada rajya he, upi kaa bajet bhi bada he
 What to do for a budget that cannot give even 1 crore rupees to the martyrs

 On the foundation stone ceremony held on December 10, 2010 on Rewa Marg, the crowd gathered

 The dream of teaching his children in English school was also floating in the eyes of 41-year-old farmer Ramvriksha
 samay beetaa
 The two-storey building of the model school was erected, but the story of Ramvriksha is still incomplete
 unheen kii tarah lakhanu main mohanlalganj ke karaura gaanv ke 53 varshiya shivvijay bhi niraash hai
 His hope of teaching his children in the model school being built outside the village for the last four years has not been fulfilled yet
 shaikshik rup se pichde ilaakon main stareey shiksha kii alakh jagaane kii jo sarkari kavayad shuru hui thi, yah uski hakeekat he jo keval ek-do skulon tak hi simit nahin he
 There are doubts over 680 model schools (see box) being opened on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalayas across the state
 is saal april main inamen padhai shuru ho jaani thi, lekin dedh maah bitne ke baad bhi inkaa bhavishya tay nahin ho paaya he
 These model schools came into existence when in 2010, the first phase of 148 model schools started in UP in 680 blocks of educationally backward, with mutual cooperation between the Center and the State
 do saal baad 45 model skool or banane lage
 The construction of 81 schools for the third phase of 2013-14 was to begin when the Code of Conduct for the Lok Sabha elections was introduced
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad centre kii bijepi sarkaar ne pichley maheene is yojana main apni 75 fisadi hissedari se haath khinch liye
 As a result, along with these model schools, the future of millions of students who were competing against urban schools were stuck in the balance

 The principals were selected by a committee headed by the Principal Secretary (secondary Education), while the committee headed by the Commissioner was entrusted with the appointment of teachers
 centre sarkaar ke haath khinchate hi shikshakon ke vetan ke rup main jaruri kareeb 40 karod ru
 The entire burden of the state fell on the state government abhi tak iskaa 75 fisadi hissaa centre ko vahan karnaa tha
 Jitendra Kumar, Principal Secretary, Department of Secondary Education, says, "the matter of their salary would get stuck on making appointments without solving financial matters
" isliye sarkaar ne philhal bhartee prakriya roak di he
 However, an official posted in the Union Human Resource Development Ministry argues that the central government has increased the percentage of states in the taxable income
 rajyon ko adhik dhan dene kii evaj main centre sarkaar ne kuch yojanaon ko “di-link” kiya he, jisamen model skool bhi hai par upi ke madhyamik shiksha mantri mehboob ali centre kii niti ko vidhyaarthiyon ke saath chhalaava maanate hai
 He says, "93 model schools were formed
 padhai shuru hone vaali thi, lekin modi sarkaar ne is yojana ko band kar chaatro ke bhavishya se khilwaad kiya he
 There is also a lot of controversy about the construction of model schools due to the delay in construction

 The state government had entrusted the responsibility of building them to seven agencies, but in the last four years, fingers have been raised on them many times

 mishra kehete hai, “model skulon ke nirmaan main bade paimaane par bhrashtachar hua he
 Not a single school has been started in four years
 sarkaar ko isaki jaanch kerani chahie
 The Central Government is also eyeing the delay in construction of model schools
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas rajyamantri ramshankar katheria kehete hai, “model skulon ko lekar rajya sarkaar bhram failaa rahi he
 The pace of their manufacture is quite slow
 rajya sarkaar pehle in skulon ko chaalu kare, uske baad aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 "the idea of handing over to private hands the Center had 75 per cent and the state 25 per cent share in the construction and operation of model schools
 par centre ke is yojana se peeche hatane ke baad rajya sarkaar inhen nijee haathon main saunpane ke formule par vichaar kar rahi he
 Under this, the government will make arrangements for land and buildings, but the responsibility of preparing other resources will be with the private operators
 sanchaalak ko tay karnaa hoga ki vah inhen upi board kii manyata ke tahat chalaanaa chahta he yaa phir kendriya board kii
 After selecting the operators, the state government will enter into a long-term contract with them

 Operators will decide the fees of 60 percent of the students

 They will also be deposited with "security Money" so that they cannot close the school in mid-session and run away

 congress netaor dilli sarkaar ke purv mantri harun usuf ne somvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki AAP kii dilli sarkaar anusuchit jati, janajati, pichhadaa varg or alcenkhyak virdohi he
 He has drastically reduced welfare schemes for the poor and marginalized, reflecting the mindset of the AAP
 harun usuf ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar apni asafalataaon se logon kaa dhyaan bhatkaate hue dilli ke logon ko bhavukta ke mudde par fansaa kar dilli ke logon kaa dhyaan dilli ke asal muddon se hataanaa chaahati he or yahi vajah he ki ab uske vidhayak dilli ke afasaron ko peet rahe hai
 Aaron alleged that the Delhi government has completely failed to benefit from the schemes provided to the Dalits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities of Delhi
 vahiin aavantit bajet kaa 50 fisadi bhi kejariwal sarkaar kharch nahin kar pai he
 The Congress released the data, alleging that the Congress government had given financial assistance to 7,62,847 students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes to purchase stationery in 2013-14, while the Kejriwal government in 2016- In 17, no student was given financial aid
 haaron ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne ST / SC / OBC ke 7,03,452 bacchon ko pehali se barahavin tak scolership di thi jabaki AAP sarkaar ne 2016-17 main 1,49,711 ko scolership di he
 According to Haroon, the Congress gave scholarship to 7163 ST / SC / OBC children in the college in 2013-14, but the AAP government did not give scholarship to any child in 2016-17
 unhone kaha ki congress ne dilli main 6 uniwarsity or 20 college khole jo sabake saamne he
 But how many colleges has the AAP opened? Aaron said that the budget of Delhi is to come but there has been no meeting on the budget and neither the Kejriwal government has been able to spend 50 percent of the budget so far
 ant ke haaron yusuf ne kejariwal sarkaar par gambheer aarope lagaate hue kaha ki "ye zindaa laash hai jinka hisaab dilli kii janata karegi"
 The entire nation is shocked by the terrorist attack on Thursday in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 is hamale main CRPF ke 40 javaanon kii shahadat hui he or desh ke tamaam raajnneetik dalon ne ek sur main hamale kii kadi ninda kii he
 Following this attack, a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) was held on Friday in which several important decisions have been taken
 is baithak main ek sarvadaleey baithak bulaane par bhi sahmati bani he jo kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh kii adhyakshata main shanivaar 11 baje sansad bhawan kii librari main hogi
 After the CCS meeting, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the Home Minister is currently going to Srinagar and will participate in several meetings there
 unhone kaha ki waapas aakar unki adhyakshata main shanivaar ko sarvadaleey baithak ho sakati he taaki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko is hamale kii puri jaankaree di ja sake
 Why is the all-party meeting important? The Modi government has tried to give a big political message by taking the decision of the all-party meeting
 tamaam vipakshi dal javaanon kii shahadat ko lekar pehle bhi centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate aae hai or aise main pulavama hamale ke baad siyaasi waar or tej ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, it is necessary for the government to take all the parties into confidence so that a decision can be taken against them against the terror in the country
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar is sarvadaleey baithak main na sirf raajnneetik dalon ko hamale kii puri jaankaree degi balki unki raay or aise hamale ke nipatane ke bare main anya dalon ke vichaaron par bhi charchaa ho sakati he
 Obviously, before the Lok Sabha elections, there is a deep political dispute between the ruling party and the opposition from Parliament to the road
 vipakshi netaa roj modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate najar aate hai or unki nitiyon kii bhi khub aalochana ho rahi he
 But in the name of the country, all parties have appeared in unison before
 sarvadaleey baithak main agar aatankwaad par lagaam kasne ke liye kisi kadam par sahmati banati he to yah puure desh kaa faisla hoga, aise main vipakshi dalon kii bhi isamen bhagidaari hogi or tab is kadam ke baad sarkaar ko gherna aasaan nahin rahegaa
 Political wrangling continues jitendra singh ne jammu- kashmir ne netaaon par aatankiyon kii tarafdaari kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki aise netaaon ko aatanki hamale kii ninda karne main bhi ksht hota he
 In response, Omar said that the Union Minister should be ashamed while making such a statement, because we have always condemned every terrorist attack in harsh words
 aisi talkhiyon se saaf he ki pakistan ke khilaaf kootnithik rishte hon yaa phir aatank virdohi oparation, in sabhi muddon ko lekar sabhi raajnneetik dal ek raay nahin rakhte hai
 Everyone wants action against terror, but there are differences in their methods
 sarkaar ab sarvadaleey baithak ke jariye un sabhi dalon ko ek manch par laane kaa kaam karegi jo pehle sarkaar kii ore se aatank ke khilaaf uthaae gaye kadamon ko shaq ke daayre main khadaa karte aa rahe hai
 This decision will make Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political stature even bigger
 aksar vipakshi dal sarkaar par aarope lagaate aae hai ki puri sarkaar sirf ek shaks chalaata he or wo hai narendra modi
 Even the cabinet does not know about the decisions of the government
 in aaropon ke jawaab main sarvadaleey baithak bulaanaa ek ranneetik kadam bhi he kyonki isse desh ke hit main sabko saath lekar chalane vaale naare ko bal bhi milegaa
 Also, the impact of this decision will also be on the leaders who have accused Narendra Modi of taking decisions alone

 The direction of electric current is considered to be the direction of motion of the cube charge
 iskaa S
 I
 maatrak ampere he, yah ek adish raashi he
 If an ampere (1A) electric current is flowing in a slick wire, it means 6 per second in that wire
 25 x 10^18 electron ke sire se pravisht hote hai
 These electrons exit at the other end
 pratirodh (resistance):kisi chaalak main vidyut dhara ke pravaahit hone par chaalak ke parimaanon tathaa anya karkon dwaara utpann kiye gaye vyavdhaan ko hi chaalak kaa pratirodh kehete he
 Its s
 I
 The unit is om (4)
 om kaa niyam (ohm's law): yadi chaalak kii bhautikee avasthaa jaise-taap aadi main koi parivartan na ho to chaalak ke siron par lagaaya gaya vibhavantar usame pravaahit dhara ke anukramanupati hota he
 If the differential between two points of a conductor is v volt and the current flowing in it is i ampere, then according to Ohm's rule - v ∝ i or v = RI where r is the constant, which is called the resistance of the conductor
 omiy pratirodh (ohmic resistance):jo chaalak om ke niyam kaa paalan karte he, unke pratirodh ko omiy pratirodh hai
 Like- manganese wire
 anomiya pratirodh (non-ohmic resitance):jo chaalaak om ke niyam kaa paalan nahin karte hai, unke pratirodh ko kehete hai
 Eg- resistance of diode bulb, resistance of triode bulb
 chaalakachaalakata (conductance):kisi chaalak pratirodh ke vyutkram ko chaalak kii chaalakata kehete hai
 Let's inform this to G
 (G=1 / R) isaki SI ikai om^-1 (Ω^-1) hota he, muho bhi kehete he
 It also has SI unit semen
 vishisht pratirodh:kisi chaalak kaa pratirodh uski lambaai ke anukramanupaati tathaa uske anuprastha kaat ke kshetrafal ke vyutkramanupati hota he, athart yadi chaalak kii lambaai l or uski anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal a he, to r ∝ 1 / r yaa, R=ρ l / a jahaan ρ ek niyatank he, jise chaalak kaa vishisht pratirodh kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, the resistance of thick wire made of the same thick material is less and the resistance of thin wire is higher
 vishisht chaalakata:kisi chaalak ke vishisht pratirodh vyutkram ko chaalak kaa vishisht chaalakata hai
 This is indicated by sigma (σ) (σ = 1 / ρ)
 isaki S

 ikai om^-1meter^-1 (Ω^-1M^-1) hoti he
 Combination of resistance: Generally, the combination of resistance occurs in two ways
 (i) shrenee kram (series combination)(ii) samanantaran kram (parallel combinatin)pratirodhon ke kram se sambandhit kuch mahatvapurn tathyashrenee kram main sanyojit pratirodhon kaa samatuly pratirodh samast pratirodhon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 The inverse of the equivalent resistance of the resistors connected in parallel order is equal to the sum of the inverse of their resistances
 vidyut shakti (elctric power):vidyut paripath main urja ke kshay hone kii dow ko shakti kehete hai
 Its s

 The unit is a volt
 kilowat ghanta maatrak athwa unit: 1 kilowat ghanta maatrak athwa unit vidyut urja kii vah maatra he, jo ki kisi paripath main ek ghanta hoti he, jabaki paripath main 1 kilowat ho

 jabaki up rajyapal kaa kahana tha ki niyamon ke mutabik mukhya sachiv ke pad ko 35 ghante se zyada khaali nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The Kejriwal government removed Secretary Services Anindo Majumdar from the post and handed over his work to Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar for issuing orders related to Gamlin's appointment

 ) Gorakhpur, the fort of the BJP, seems to be cracking after 20 years
 yahaan hue upachunaav main bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla sapa ke praveen nishad se peeche chal rahe hai
 This result is shocking as Gorakhpur seat has been with BJP since 1989
 is baar party ke liye halaat 1998 or 1999 jaise lag rahe hai jab bijepi ko sapa se kadaa muqabla mila tha or yogi kaa yahaan se jeetne main pasinaa chhot gaya tha
 The Gorakhpur by-elections are being considered as the semi-finals of 2019
 aise main bijepi ne jeetne ke liye puri takat jhonk di thi, pichley ek maheene se siem yogi adityanath or unki cabinet ke diggajon ne yahaan deraa jamaa rakhaa tha
 But forgetting the 23-year-old rivalry, the SP-BSP came together and then it became difficult for the BJP to win
 avaidhyanath kii siyaasi viraasat 1998 main unke uttaradhikari or upi ke maujuuda mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sanbhali
 Yogi became MP from here five times in a row
 ve 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009 or 2014 main bijepi ke ummidavaar ke taur par jite
 But in 1998 and 1999, Yogi had to chew iron gram to win Gorakhpur parliamentary seat
 1998 ke loksabhachunaav se yogi adityanath ne siyasat main kadam rakhaa
 SP had fielded Jamuna Prasad Nishad in front of him
 yogi ko 2 lakh 68 hajaar 428 vot mili the
 While the SP candidate got 2 lakh 42 thousand 222 votes
 is tarah yogi mahaj 26 hajaar 206 vot se jite
 At the same time, the BSP candidate had secured about 94 thousand votes and the Congress had got 20 thousand votes
 yani 1998 main agar sapa or basapa ek hote to yogi sansad hi nahin pahunch pate
 Yogi Adityanath got a stiff competition from 1998 in 1999
 unka ye doosraa chunaav tha
 Yogi was a candidate from BJP and before him the SP again fielded Jamuna Prasad Nishad
 nishad ne yogi ko pehle se zyada kadaa muqabla diya or yogi ko dobaaraa se jeet darj karne main lohe ke chane chabane pade
 In the 1999 Lok Sabha election, Yogi got 2 lakh 67 thousand 382 votes, while sp's Jamuna Prasad got 2 lakh 60 thousand 43 votes
 is tarah yogi mahaj 7 hajaar 339 vot se jeet darj kar sake the
 Let me tell you that Yogi Adityanath resigned from the Lok Sabha membership here after becoming the CM of UP last year after being an MP from Gorakhpur for the last five times
 yogi kii karmbhumi gorakhpur loksabhaa seat ke upachunaav ke liye bijepi ke upendra shukla or basapa samarthit sapa ke ummidavaar praveen nishad hai
 At the same time, Congress has fielded Surhita Karim
 upachunaav main 1998 or 1999 jaisaa hi sameekaran dikh rahaa he
 BJP has fielded Upendra Shukla on Yogi's seat, while SP has nominated Pravin Nishad of Nishad community as before
 basapa ne is baar sapa ummidavaar ko samarthan kiya he
 In such a situation, the SP candidate is not only giving a competition to the BJP but is continuously ahead of it

 Network spread across many states 25 july yani agle buudhvaar ko pakistan main ellection hai
 People will vote for the new government
 magar kya pakistan main vaaki chunaav hone vaale hai yaa sirf ye chunavi dikhaava bhar he? ye sawaal bahari duniya se nahin, balki khud pakistan ke andar se hi uth rahe hai
 Actually, the most recent news is coming that this time the election is not just going to be an election in Pakistan
 pakistan ke nae wazeere aazam yani pradhanmantri kaa sellection or ye sellection chunaav ke jariye pakistani avam nahin, balki pakistani sena karne ja rahi he
 Now the Pakistan Army is opening the cards, till now history tells who will sit on the throne of Islamabad, 688 km from Delhi
 ye vahaan kii fouj hi tay karti he
 She either makes one of her representatives the rightful owner of the country or gets herself occupied
 to saal 2018 kaa aam chunaav isse achoota kaise rah jaataa
 So far, the Pakistani Army, which is hiding its leaves, has slowly started clearing its stand
 nawaz se naaraaz he paak armypakistan kii siyasat main achaanak uthal-puthal tej ho gai he
 There is a voice coming from all sides in the suppressed language that this time also there is going to be no election in Pakistan
 to sawaal ye ki aakhir ye sellection kiskaa he
 It is reported that till now the army is angry with Nawaz Sharif, who commanded the Pakistani army
 kyonki unka sabase bada gunaah ye he ki unhone saarvajanik taur par kabool kiya ki bharat par hue do bade aatanki hamale pakistan kii dharti se karaae gaye
 While the second crime was against the attacks on Jamhooriyat in the country
 sena kii pasand imran khanzaahir he pakistan main sena kii naaraazgi matlab yaa to desh nikaala hota he yaa jail
 Nawaz Sharif showed courage and chose prison while separating his Mustakabil from the army
 to nawaz nahin to phir koun
 It is reported from the sources that the army has fixed Pakistan's staff
 or 26 july ko vahaan ellection nahin balki sirf secoction hoga
 That too of Imran Khan, the new puppet of the Pakistani army
 sena kaa chunaavon main hastkshepapakistan ke ek bade angreji akhbaar ke adhikari ne ek intervyuu main aarope lagaaya he ki pakistan kii sena vahaan ke chunaavon main hastkshep kar rahi he
 And cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan and his party are supporting PTI
 mulk ke ek aadh tivi channelon ko chhodkar baaki channelon ne to imran khan ko takreeban jeeta hua ghoshit kar diya he
 However, the Opinion Poll picture has been vomited
 or wo nawaz ko phir se pakistan kii gaddi nawaz rahe hai
 a sign of this nexus between the PTI and the Pak Army is the nexus between Imran and Imran that the path of Imran has already been cleared by sending Nawaz to jail
 or rahi sahi kasar unki party ke ummidavaaron to notice bhejkar puri kii ja rahi he
 Pressure is being pressured from top-down, right-left on Muslim League Nawaz-ticketed candidates to return the ticket or join another party or contest free elections
 chunaav main dhaandhlee ke aropasaal 2013 ke chunaav main imran kii taharik-e-insaaf ko pehali baar kaumi assembly kii 32 siten mili thim or wo 166 siten jeetne vaali nawaz shareef kii party par chunaav main dhaandhlee ke aaropon par dharne detii rahi
 But this time everyone except Imran Khan is screaming that the election is not going to happen on 26th of July, but the supporters of Imran Khan say that this time there will be no rigging
 pakistan nahin badalegajankaar maan rahe hai ki paak sena ellection kaa rukh modane par lagi hui he
 So the extremists are also playing freely
 sirf ek hafte main teen badi ghatnaayen 168 jaane le chuki hai
 In such an atmosphere of turmoil and manipulation, whoever will form the government after 26 July, how long will it be able to run and get the country out of the quagmire of economic, political and diplomatic bankruptcy
 filhal isaki parvaah kisi ko nahin he
 So this time too it is certain that this will happen in Pakistan as it happens every time
 paak main chunaav keval dikhaava!har chunaav main vot daalane vaale kii khwaahish hoti he ki desh kaa kal aaj se behatar ho
 But on 26th the voter will vote with the blessing that as the conditions are today, tomorrow at least it should not be worse
 jaankaar sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki jab ellection nahin sellection karnaa he to chunaav kaa dhakosla karke mulk kaa paanch-chah arab rupee kaa kharchaa kyon kiya ja rahaa he? kya duniya ko ye bataane ke liye ki pakistan main chunaav bhi hote hai? 9 Indian youths who have been imprisoned in Iran for the past two years have finally been released after intervention by the Ministry of External Affairs

 com / bai9f3jqcj If Pakistan does not implement the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, then the question arises what options are left with India again
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki aisi suuratehaal main bharat ke paas suraksha parishad main jane kaa vikalp hoga
 In this regard, the United Nations (UN) Charter states that every member of the United Nations is bound to uphold the decisions of the International Court of Justice and if either party or party fails to implement the decision, the other party or the Party Security Council Can turn to uske baad suraksha parishad faisle kaa kriyanvayan karaane ke upayon par vichaar karegaa

 Siddharth Luthra said, "ICJ is a body where you go on the basis of consent
 is maamle main pakistan kah saktaa he ki bharat ne isije main jane se pehle hamase sahmati nahin lee thi to is maamle main court ke adhikaar kshetra par sawaal uth saktaa he
 Such decisions are indeed binding when the countries concerned agree to obey them
 yadi pakistan court ke jajment ke khilaaf jaataa he to bharat is masale ko suraksha parishad ke paas le ja saktaa he
 It is noteworthy that Kulbhushan Jadhav has been sentenced to death by the Pakistani military court on charges of espionage

 siddharth luthra ne kaha, ''isije aisa nikaay he jahaan aap sahmati ke aadhaar par jate hai
 In this case Pakistan can say that if India did not agree with us before going to the ICJ, then the jurisdiction of the court in this case can be questioned
 aise faisle vastav main tab badhyakaari hote hai jab sambandhit desh isko maanane par sahmati dete hai
 If Pakistan goes against the Judgment of the Court, India can take this issue to the Security Council

 Where did they spend the night and where were they preparing to go
 ab shanivaar ko is website ne us sabase rahasyamayi din ke bare main tathy pesh kiye hai
 These facts are based on documents that Netaji's grandson and Ashish Ray, working as a freelance journalist in Britain, have released
 vimaan durghatana vaale din kaa puraa vivaran-website ke matabik, 18 agast 1945 kii us subah, ek japani air force bamavarshak vimaan ne vietnam ke toran se udaan bhari
 There were 12 or 13 passengers and crew members, including Subhash Chandra Bose
 saath hi japani sena ke leftinent general tsunamsha shidei bhi usamen the
 The flight was to travel to Taipei, Darren and then to Tokyo via Taiwan's interests
 bharat sarkaar dwaara 1956 main gathit teen sadasyeey netaji jaanch samiti ko bataaya gaya ki mausam thik tha or aircraft kaa ingine bhi sahi tareeke se kaam kar rahaa tha
 So the pilot decided to go directly to Taipei via Hito
 koshish yah thi vahaan dopaher se pehle-pehle pahunchaa ja sake
 Fearing a malfunction in the left engine of the plane, Major Air Taro Kono, the Air Staff Officer who was one of the passengers aboard the plane, came before the inquiry committee and said, 'I felt that the engine on the left side of the plane was not working properly
 
 isliye main plane ke bheetar gaya or ingine kii jaanch ke baad pataa chalaa ki vah thik kaam kar rahaa tha
 He said that an engineer also checked the engine with him and agreed that the aircraft could take off
 haalanki us airport par tab ground ejeeniyar ke rup main maujuud captain naakaamura elias yamamoto ne isse sahamat nahin the
 He believed that the left part of the engine was not working properly
 major taaro cono ke mutabik, payalat ne tab bataaya tha ingine nayaa he
 Taro Kono said, 'after slowing the engine speed, the pilot worked on it for about five minutes
 ingine kii jaanch do baar major taakijawa (payalat) dwaara kii gai
 After this i too became satisfied
 major taakijawa bhi ise lekar sahamat dikhe ki ingine ke saath ab koi samasya nahin he
 'explosion as soon as it took off, a short time later, the aircraft exploded as it took off
 subhash chandra bosake edisi karnal habib ur rahamaan or ek anya sahyatri ke anusaar vah visphot kaaphi tej tha
 According to Rahman, it was a sound like a cannon
 captain naakaamura us samay ground par hi maujuud the or unhone sabakuch dekha
 He said, 'as the flight took place, the plane tilted to the left and i saw something falling from it
 baad main mujhe pataa chalaa ki ye propeller he
 Nakamura also stated that the aircraft must have been at an altitude of 30-40 meters at the time of the explosion
 captain naakaamura ke mutabik, 'plane kancreet ke bane ranve se kareeb 100 meter aage gira tha or girane ke saath hi iske aage ke hisse main aag lag gai thi
 'according to Colonel Rahman,' Netaji turned towards me
 maine unase kaha ki aage se nikliye
 
 peeche se rasta nahin he
 We could not go towards the main door because it was jammed with other things and stuff
 isliye netaji aag se hote hue baahar nikal gaye
 i came out through the same flames
 ''unke kapadon main aag lagi thi'rahamaan ne aage bataaya, 'baahar aate hi maine dekha ki vah mujhase 10 yard aage khadey hai or mujhase thik ulat pashchim kii ore dekh rahe hai
 His clothes were still on fire
 main unki ore teji se dauda or unke shart belt ko unase alag karne main mujhe kaaphi dikkat hui
 His pants were not on fire, so it was not necessary to take them off
 (karnal rahamaan oonee uniform main the jabaki bose khaaki rang ke sooti kapade pahane hue the
 This however is only an estimate
 is aadhaar par ki unke kapado main jaldi aag lag gai thi)
 'colonel Rahman further said,' i put them on the ground
 tabhi maine dekha ki unke sir par gahari chot lagi thi
 Probably on the left side of their head
 unka cheharaa jhulas gaya tha
 The hair was also on fire and they also got scorched
 'unhone aage bataaya, 'netaji ne hindustani bhashaa main mujhase poocha- aapako zyada to nahin lagi? maine kaha, mujhe lagata he ki main jald hi acha mahasoos karne lagunga
 He then said about himself that he felt as if he would not be saved
 ' bose ne aage kaha, 'jab apane mulk waapas jaaen to mulki bhaiyon ko bataanaa ki main aakhri dam tak mulk kii aazaadee ke liye ladata rahaa hum
 May they continue independence
 hindustan jarur aaazaad hoga
 No slave can keep him
 'leftinent karnal shiro nonogaki bhi us flite main the
 He said, 'when i first saw Netaji after the plane crash, he was standing somewhere around the left end of the left wing of the plane
 unke kapadon main aag lagi thi or unka koi sahaayak us kot ko unase alag karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 'the plane had crashed, Bosekernal Shiro had been injured,' estimated Netaji as he was sitting very close to the petrol tank, so his body must have been splashed with petrol
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki unka puraa sharir aag kii lapaton se ghira hua he
 There was a contradiction in information provided by Colonel Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Nonogaki, Major Kono, Capt Nakamura and other eyewitnesses
 yah sabhi us ghatana ke 11 saal baad apana anubhav darj kara rahe the
 But it was so clear that the plane crashed and Bose was seriously injured in it
 unhen gambhir avasthaa main tatkaal najadik ke nenmon sainik aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 British officers sent an investigative team to Bangkok, Saigon and Taipei in September-1945
 is team main messors fini or davis, ech ke roy or ke pi de shaamil the
 The job of this team was to find out where Bose is and if possible, he should be arrested

 Thereafter, further investigations were handed over by Military Intelligence in May-1946 to Lieutenant Colonel J

 Figes then separately interrogated six Japanese army officers and confirmed the crash

 After this, Harin Shah of India's Free Press Journal newspaper went to Taipei in August-1946

 According to the website, information about what happened after Netaji was admitted to the hospital will be published on 16 January

 Before discussing the bill, Amit Shah said in the House on Monday that i tell the Congress mps that if you prove in the discussion that this bill is a bill to take away someone's right, then i will go back with the bill
 unhone kaha ki yah bill kisi ke adhikaar ko chhinane kaa nahin balki adhikaar dene kaa bill he
 The Home Minister said that this bill gives shelter to the oppressed on the basis of religion

 The Home Minister said that Manmohan Singh and LK Advani fall in the same category as those who have come from outside

 After the match they congratulate and thank each other well
 srilanka par team india kii jeet ke baad captain kohli ne bataaya ki unhone or rohit sharma ne faisla kiya tha ki 16wein over ke baad ve 2 ran nahin lenge
 Kohli said it was very hot when we were batting there

 Kohli said that it actually helped a lot
 ham keval gend ko dekh rahe the us samay hamaare paas jitani takat bachi thi ham vahi kar sakate the

 We have been a big partnership before and today's partnership was special

 K
 venugopal ne kaha ki nagaraj maamle main supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke faisle kii samiksha kii jarurat he
 - AG said in court that if Dalits and tribals are not given reservation in promotion in government jobs, then corrective measures will be only virtual or misleading
 - court ne poocha ki ajtak kisi bhi rajya ne sarkari sevaaon ke vibhinn kaders main dalit adivaasiyon ke kam pratinidhitiv ko samuchit str tak laane kii garaj se aankade jutaney kii koshish kyon nahin kii?- centre sarkaar ne kaha, kyonki data hameshaa upar neeche hota rahata he
 People retire, die while on the job

 - The debate has been completed on behalf of the Central Government
 centre sarkaar ne maang ki 12 saal puraane nagaraj faisale ko saat jajon kii samvidhan peeth ke paas punarvichaar ke liye bheja janaa chahie
 It is worth noting that the Constitution Bench is reviewing its 12-year-old decision on the issue of SC-ST reservation for the 'creamy layer' in the promotion of government jobs
 peeth is baat par bhi vichaar kar rahi he ki is mudde par saat jajon kii peeth ko punarvichaar karne kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 During the hearing on Friday, the court asked the government why it needed to review its 12-year-old decision on the issue of SC-ST reservation
 On which the AG said on behalf of the central government that the 12-year-old 2006 M
 nagaraj faisalaa SC / ST ke pramotion main aarakshan main baadhak ban rahaa he
 The AG said that once they have got a job on the basis of SC / ST, then why need data again for reservation in promotion
 gauratlab he kisupreme courtne isse pehle maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue centre sarkaar ko SC / ST karmchaariyon ko pramotion dene kii ijaajat de di thi
 SC / ST has been marginalized for 1000 years, the Supreme Court said that according to the decision of Nagraj of 2006, the government can give reservation to SC / ST in promotion only on the basis of data it is decided that their representation is low and they strengthen the administration needed for
 is par sarkaar kii ore se AG ne kaha ki wo (SC / ST) 1000 saalon se haashiye par rahe hai
 The AG said how would we decide that their representation is low? Will it be on the basis of every post or according to the entire department? Or will the entire department be considered standard? AG ne kaha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki 22
 5% (15% SC + 7
 5% ST) sarkari padon par tarakkee main bhi SC / ST ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan ho
 The Attorney General told the court that SC / ST can be given appropriate representation in this way
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki saal main hone vaale pramotion main SC / ST karmchaariyon ke liye 22
 5% reservation should be available
 aisa karne se hi unke pratinidhitiv kii kami kii bharpai ho sakati he
 The Central Government said that there should not be a test of backwardness of SC / ST class at the time of promotion, because the Supreme Court had said in Indra Sawhney's decision that backwardness does not apply to SC / ST as they are considered backward
 SC / ST act main bhi sarkaar ne kiya badlavadaliton ke mudde par ghiri centre sarkaar ke liye ye ek ahm mudda he
 In view of the displeasure of the Dalit community, the Narendra Modi government of the Center has decided to bring the SC / ST Act to the old and original form
 buudhvaar ko cabinet kii baithak main SC / ST act sanshodhan vidheyak ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di gai
 It is believed that the government will again restore the original provisions of the Act by introducing this amendment bill in this monsoon session

 Under this rule, business establishments will have to pay UIDAI Rs 20 for verification of each customer and 50 paise for verifying transaction of money in deals
 is sambandh main yuidiai kii ore se notification jari kar di gai he
 According to the notification, each e-kyc will charge Rs 20 for Aadhaar service and 50 paise for confirmation of yes or no at the time of each transaction of money
 yah shulk tex free hoga

 After this, on paying the fee, you will have to pay an interest rate of about one and a half percent every month
 iske saath hi unke aadhaar satyaapan or i-kevaisi sevaaon ko roak diya jaayegaa
 An official in this regard said that earlier commercial establishments had to spend at least Rs 150 to Rs 200 on verification of a customer without Aadhaar facility
 aadhaar ke jariye veriphication main companiyon or unke graahakon- donon ko suvidha rahati he
 Despite paying this fee for Aadhaar service, they will remain in profit
 yuidiai sutron kaa kahana he ki ye shulk license shulk or vittiya ankush ke atirikt honge
 Explain that the Supreme Court has rejected the plea to link Aadhaar card and voter ID
 darasal, vakil ashvini upaadhyaay kii ne ek arji daayar kii thi
 In this filed petition, it was requested to direct the voter ID card to be linked to the Aadhaar card

 pdf Bollywood actress Swara Bhaskar, who is famous for her impunity on many issues, has made serious allegations against the Sangh Parivar and BJP
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki nafrat bhare sandesh bhejne ke maamle main khaskar sangh parivaar or bijepi ke log hote hai, jo moorkhtapurna va nafrat bhare sandesh bhejte hai
 Swara said, those doing this should ask themselves why Bollywood actors should stay away from these things and why they should be the target of hate trolling
 swara ne kaha- vah soshal media par nafrat bhare trol ko gambhirtha se leti hai, kyonki nafrat karne waalon or aise troling se maanavtaa ke girte str ko saamne laana behad jaruri he, jo nijee hit ke liye paise lekar kiye jate hai
 Is amazon india scared of campaign? Swara Bhaskar's tweet had to be removed in an interview to IANS, Swara said - It is always difficult to stand up for what is right
 main troling ko gambhirtha se leti hum
 He defended the silence of Bollywood actors on all issues, saying, in a country like India where there is no accountability for heinous crime and people follow you on saying something, in such a case, one will unnecessarily fall into the matter themselves Does not want to make it weak
 swara ne kaha, agar ham kalakaaron kaa sammaan nahin karte, to phir abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa sammaan nahin karte
 We do not respect to disagree on any opinion
 swara se jab poocha gaya ki vah achche yaa bure ke liye, soshal media par suni jane vaali aawaaj ban chuki hai, to kya yah unke liye ek jimmedaari kii tarah ban gaya he?unhone kaha, "bilkul
 i think i have never seen myself raising or speaking on social media as a responsible person
 ek kalakaar ke rup main yaa chintak ke rup main aap apane aas-paas kii duniya se jud jate hai or phir soshal media par kabhi-kabhi bhayaavah chijen dekhne ko milti hai, jisase aap pratikriya dene ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 "padmaavat's 'khilji' said this on Swara Bhaskar's open letter
 He said, very few people speak honestly, so if you speak honestly then you have to face trolling and criticisms
 kathua maamle main bollywood se or zyada pratikriya nahin aane ke bare main poochne par swar ne kaha, jahaan tak is khaas maamle kaa sawaal he to har kisi ne, chaahe bollywood se ho yaa am nagirak sabane virodh jataayaa or yah vaastavik or bade paimaane par tha, kyonki yah bahut bhayaavah or jaghanya aparaadh tha, jo hamaare samaaj kii bahut bhayaavah sthiti bayaan karti he, khaskar jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai, donon maamalon (unnav or kathua dushkarm) main sarkaar kaa kya rukh rahaa
 Trolls are unintelligent
 Swara said, "people tell me why you respond to trolls
 main samajhati hum ki trol karne vaale naasamajh log hote hai, phir bhi main jawaab detii hum, isliye ki shaayad meraa twit padhakar das log meri baat se prabhavit ho jaaen
 "said-" i think it is very important to expose such haters and it is necessary to bring down the falling human stature of these trolls and if some of them are famous faces, then it is necessary to expose them, because in such times silence In a way it will be your participation in their work

 Kumble then resigned from the post of coach
 shuukravaar ko india today conklev south main vivies lakshmana ne kaha ki kumble ne coach or usase pehle bharat kaa captain rahete hue acha pradarshan kiya tha

 jiya ul haq ne yah bhi kaha tha,"hamen ladaai ke aise tareeke apnaane chahie, jise kashmir samaj or sambhaal sake
 In other words, the physical and moral use of means other than military action, which would destroy the mental strength of the enemy, damage his political capacity and show him as oppressive to the world

 Today (12 August), the birth of 1924 General zia-ul-haq, the seeds of terrorism and separatism sown through Operation Topac in Kashmir, both countries are paying the price
 general jiya ul haq pakistan ko na keval dharmik kattarta kii aag main jhonk diya balki kashmir ko bhi sulgaane kaa kaam kiya
 The thorns of bigotry that he sowed during his reign are piercing the feet of Pakistan today
 pakistan tarakkee kii raah se mudakar aatankwaad ke raste par chal padaa he
 Journalist Reema Abbasi of Pakistan's newspaper Dawn told during the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2016 that the country had to bear the brunt of the constitutional provisions made by General zia-ul-haq in 1973 for the next 40 years
 unhone yah vyavastha kii ki koi bhi gaiyr muslim vyakti desh kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karegaa
 This was a major symbolic move to push the country towards religious fundamentalism
 bakaul rima abbasi," general jiya ul haq ke kaarykaal ke dauraan samachar patron ke karyaalayon main sainik tainaat rahete the jo akhbaar ke chhapane se pehle jaanch karte the ki koi sarkaar virdohi khabar to nahin chap rahi he
 "what was Operation Topac This plan was named after Prince Topac Samru
 isaki vajah yaha ki unhone 18veen shatabdi main urugbe main spani shashan ke khilaaf aparamparaagat yuddh kaa sanchaalan kiya tha
 Actually, Pakistani President General Zia ul Haq had implemented K-2 (khalistan, Kashmir and Operation Topac) war policy against India
 oparation topac ke tahat ghati or punjab main samanaantar aatankwaad ke beej bona tha
 Under the first phase, large-scale militants were infiltrated into the valley
 udhar punjab ke sikh yuvaaon ko khalistaan ke sapane dikhaakar unhen bhi algaavvaad or aatankwaad ke raste par le jane ke liye training pakistan ne shuru karai
 Pakistan wanted that it would be easy to destabilize India by fighting terrorism on two fronts, Punjab and Valley
 oparation topac ke jariye sikh or kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ke bich samanvay sthapit karne kii niti bani
 Under this, there was a system of training, money and weapons for separatists in Pakistan
 nateeja rahaa ki kashmir main aatankwaad ne bhayankar rup le liya
 The separatists were also admitted to all government and non-government places for insurgent activities under Operation Topac Scheme
 oparation topac ke tahat dhai lakh kashmiri panditon par atyaachaar kar unhen gharon se bhaga diya gaya
 Sharia law implemented in Pakistan, help to become Taliban as General Zia ul Haq attained heights in the army, the fanaticism about religion grew in them
 jab takhtapalat ke baad jiya ul haq ne raashtrapati pad sambhala to samvidhan ko thukaraate hue sharia kanoon ko lagu kiya tha
 Due to which Pakistan started on the path of religious fundamentalism
 aaj pakistan badahaali ke jis mode par he, vahaan tak pahunchane main general jiya ul haq kii nitiyaan jimmedaar bataai jaati hai
 Throughout his tenure, zia-ul-haq remained America's 'yesman'
 america ke sahyog se general jiya ul haq ne afghanistan main chhide yuddh ke dauraan soviet rus ko vahaan se baahar jane par majaboor kar diya tha
 This led to the rise of the Taliban in northern Pakistan
 sthaneey kattarpanthi tatv haaavee ho gaye or nateeja taliban ke rup main ek nai chunauti duniya ke saamne ai
 Whoever made the army chief, the same was executed by Deepakistan Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who made General Zia-ul as Chief of Army Staff
 magar usee general jiya ul haq ne mauka milte hi 5 july 1977 ko na keval julfikar ali bhutto kaa takhtapalat kar sainya shashan lagu kar diya, balki unhen jail bhejkar baad main faansee par bhi lataka diya
 Jiya had argued the coup behind the coup, saying that Pakistan's condition had deteriorated during Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's tenure, hence military rule was necessary
 dilli main kii thi padhai, plane krash main hui mautgeneral jiya ul haq kaa janm 12 agast 1924 ko punjab ke jalandhar main hua tha
 He studied at the famous St
 Stephen's College in Delhi
 bantwaare ke baad unka parivaar pakistan chalaa gaya
 Zia ul Haq ruled Pakistan from July 1977 to August 1988
 magar 17 agast 1988 ko pakistan ke bahawalpur main ek plane krash ke dauraan jiya ul haq kii maut ho gai thi
 31 people died in that accident

 It is the year 2000
 mujhe singapore main ek conference kaa nimantran mila tha
 Top medical giants from all over the world were to attend it
 america main motaape kii mahamari apane charam par thi or kuch pratishthit america sarjanon ne yah charchaa kii thi ki isse kis tarah chikitsa kii duniya main nae morche khul rahe hai, jaise wet los surgery
 i went into deep thinking
 main waapas lautaa or bharat main motaape par jo bhi aankade mil sakate the, vah jutaaye
 Statistics showed that between 1989 and 1999, the number of obese people in the country increased rapidly
 isse bhi adhik chaunkaane vaali baat yah thi ki itani hi vruddhi 1999 se 2001 ke teen saal main hui thi
 i could clearly see that obesity is silently attacking India
 kahin kuch gadabad to thiah bharatiyon kii khan-paan kii aadaten badal rahi thim
 The Government of India opened its doors to the world in 1990 with historical policy reforms
 usee saal dilli ke conot place main bharat ke pehle videshi fast food chen kaa restaraan khulaa tha
 The excitement of new and convenient food made us forget what we always ate
 haalanki kisi vyakti kaa vajan badhane ke khatre ko uske jin nirdhaarit karte he, lekin sahi vajan kaayam rakhane ke liye calories ke seven kaa santulan ahm hota he
 Energy-intensive diets — containing more complex carbohydrates, sugar, and saturated fat, as well as reduced physical activity — have contributed to this growing epidemic
 is sthiti ko badalanaa jaruri tha
 Till that time, we used to see obesity as a kind of cosmetic problem
 lekin motopa bahut hi mushkil or kharchili beemaari he
 In fact, it is the root of many diseases
 maine apni mitra shyama chona se baat kii, jo us samay dilli ke aar
 K
 puram sthit deepies main prisimple thim, or pehali baar unheen ke skool se jaagrukta abhiyaan shuru kiya
 a survey of school children in Delhi's affluent schools found obesity rates of 12-13 per cent in 2002
 2006 tak yah dar 30 fisadi tak pahunch gai
 Now it is about 40 percent
 2004 main maine obesity and metabolic surgery socity of india kii sthapana kii, desh ke saare ahm logon ke saamne apni baat rakhi or antat do raashtrapatiyon-ke

 Abdul Kalam spoke in front of him
 us samay tak motaape kii samasya vaishvik rup se teji se failati ja rahi thi, or use 'obesity' kii bajaae 'globasity' kaha jane laga tha
 Now it was not just the problem of developed countries
 bharat main kuposhan ke saath-saath maujuud is samasya ne chikitsa sambandhi aarthik boj ko doguna kar diya tha
 Obesity is a complex condition that has serious social and psychological aspects, and affects almost all age groups
 motaape se tip tu diabetes, hriday rog, hisertension or stroke, baanjhpan or kuch tarah ke cancer viksit hone kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 The thing that makes it dangerous for us is that unlike caucasians (white people), we take the most dangerous kind of obesity: abdominal obesity, which wreaks havoc on the heart, blood sugar and cholesterol
 motaape kii yah tsunami jald hi un rogiyon main jhalkane lagi, jo mujh tak aate theah aise log jo itane baari the ki ve saans nahin le pate the, khadey nahin ho pate the, bamushkil chal pate the, wheelchair par hi guzaara karte the yaa apane juuton ke feete khud nahin baandh sakate the
 They had gone beyond the limits of medicine, dosage and exercise
 wet los (yaa beriatric) surgery america main prachlan main aa chuki thi or nai praudyogiki aane lagi thi, aise main ham main se kuch logon ne bharat main surgery kii shuruyaat kii
 This was done as a last resort and to save the lives of patients who had undergone several unsuccessful weight loss efforts under surveillance and / or monitoring
 is tarah kii surgery ke vibhinn prakaar hote hai: gastric banding, bypass yaa pet ko baandh kar ek chota paauch bana dena, yaa sleeve gastrectomi, yaa amashay kaa adhikansh hissaa hataakar baaki bache hisse ko sirf ek patali tub main tabdeel kar dena
 The risks associated with operations have decreased over time
 marijon ke vajan main ausatan 6-8 kilo prati maah kii kami aati he, or isse in rogiyon main hone vaale parivartan ke bare main badha-chadha kar kehane vaali koi baat nahin bachati he
 The results are impressive and life is changing
 isamen multidiciplinary tarika apanaaya jaataa he jisamen dietician, counslar, manovaigyanik or motopa kam karne main madad karne vaale kai log shaamil hote hai
 Today it is a truly wonderful experience for a surgeon to see how a patient travels from obesity to agility

 Lalit Modi and Sushma Swaraj are currently in a storm in the political corridor
 lalit modi ne maamle main pehali baar apane vakil mahmud abdi kii jubaani apana paksh rakhaa he
 At a press conference in Mumbai, his lawyer said that Lalit Modi has been a political target ever since Sunanda Pushkar's stake in the IPL was disclosed
 mumbai main press conference ke dauraan abdi ne kaha kiunke muvakkilake khilaaf koi blue corner notice jari nahin kiya gaya he
 Whereas immediately after this, the Enforcement Directorate has given clarification
 ED ne kaha ki vah kisi aadmi ko notice nahin bhejtaa, lihaaja airport ko blue corner notice jari kiya gaya tha or yah notice 2012 main deshbhar ke airport ko bheja gaya tha
 According to sources, the Enforcement Directorate is set to tighten the screws on Lalit Modi
 lalit modi samet kai duusare adhikariyon ko 1700 karod ke videshi mudra kanoon ulanghan ke solah maamalon main jald notice bhejne kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 An officer of the directorate said, "including all the cases will be around 1700 crores
 lekin isamen lalit modi ke saath hi duusare kai adhikari bhi honge
 All these were under scrutiny from the beginning
 yah sab pehle se tay tha
 It is not that this step has been taken suddenly
 'dikhaai interpol kii chittheelalit modi ke vakil mahmud abdi ke mutabik unke muvakkil ke khilaaf aisa koi aarope hi nahin
 He has issued a letter from Interpol to defend his case
 abdi kaa daawa he ki jab se modi bharat se gaye hai tabhi se lagaataar ve idi or police ke sampark main hai or unhen bhagoda ghoshit karne kii koi jarurat hi nahin thi
 Lalit Modi, who is not a fugitive, said that no court of India has ever declared Lalit Modi a fugitive
 vah landan main puure niyam kanoon ke tahat rah rahe hai or tamaam partiyaan is mudde kaa jabaran raajnneetikaran kar rahi hai
 He said that no police from Mumbai Police has ever described Modi as a fugitive
 vakil ne kaha ki media hameshaa se hi lalit modi par hamalavar rahaa he
 One section of the media has always targeted Modi
 unhone media par modi kii patni ke thik hone kaa daawa karne par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki kya media ke paas unki patni ke ilaaj se sambandhit pukhta jaankaree he

 kukhyat aatanki masood ajahar par sanyukt raashtra main pratibandh lagane par samarthan hasil karne ke liye bharat ne duniya ke sabhi deshon main apane duutavaason or ucchayogon ko dogier bheje hai
 These evidences have been handed over by the embassies to the countries concerned
 sutron ne ajtak-india today ko bataaya ki bharat ne pakistan ko dogier isliye bheje the, kyonki vah kah rahaa tha ki masood or jaish ke aatanki karrwai ke bare main uske paas koi saboot nahin he
 But Pakistan has rejected the Indian dossier
 ek sutara ne kaha, 've kuch alag vyavhaar karte to yah chamatkaar hi hota, unke dwaara dogier ko khaarij karnaa kuch aisa nahin he ki jisaki ham ummid nahin kar rahe the
 'china has previously gone all out of India's effort to ban Masood Azhar, the chief of jaish-e-mohammed in the United Nations, and has used his veto power to send five permanent members of the UN Security Council Get

 So India is trying to persuade not only China but also the 14 member countries of the Security Council, countries all over the world, where the Embassy or High Commission of India is
 sutron ne bataaya, 'sabhi bhartiya duutavas or ucchayog ne dogier ke khaas ansh duniya ke har desh se saajha kiye hai
 'the date of March 13 is important in the case of banning Masood Azhar, as it is the last date for a country to object to the ban proposal sponsored by France, America and Britain
 ek sutara ne bataaya, 'ham yuanessi ke sabhi 15 sadsy deshon tak pahunche hai, na sirf nai dilli sthit unke mishan balki unki sambandhit rajdhaniyon main bhi
 We will leave no stone unturned in securing the support of all member states
 ' masood ajahar ko global tebrist ke rup main soochibaddh karaane ke liye pichley 10 saal main sanyukt raashtra main yah chauthaa prayaas he
 'earlier three attempts of 2009, 2016 and 2017 failed
 lekin har baar pakistan ko bachaane ke liye china apane vito power kaa istemaal karata rahaa
 So this time, if China does not object, then on March 13, terrorist Masood Azhar will be included in the UN banned list
 yah alag baat he ki sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandhit suchi main shaamil karne se kisi aatanki aakaa ko jail kii salaakhon ke peeche daalane main koi bahut madad nahin milti, isse ek tarah kaa dabaav jarur banataa he
 Hafiz Saeed has been designated as a terrorist by the United Nations, but he is still roaming freely in Pakistan

 Pakistan will have to take action if there is international pressure
 ham yahi chaahate hai ki imran ke mantri ajahar ke saath koi sampark na rakhen or vah jail kii salaakhon ke peeche ho

 During this time, the BSP supremo alleged that like demonetisation and GST, the central government is adopting immature and obstinate attitude in the case of triple talaq
 isse peedit muslim mahilaon kii samasyaayein aasaani se hal hone vaali nahin hai
 Apart from politics inspired by the Sangh program, Mayawati also attacked the three-day program in Delhi under the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 unhone kaha ki yah puraa kaarykram raajnneeti se prerit he
 The purpose of this program was to hide all the shortcomings of the BJP and the central government before the elections and talk about its agenda to the Sangh
 isaki koshish sarkaar kii kamiyon, vifaltaaon or desh kii badi samasyaon se dhyaan hataakar duusari taraf le janaa he
 The BJP government's anti-poor, laborers and farmers said that the BJP government is anti-poor, workers and farmers

 ’sangh pramukh ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue mayawati ne kaha ki basapa is soch se bilkul bhi sahamat nahin he
 He said that no matter how many temples are built, the relationship between narrow Sanghi Hindus and Muslims is not going to be normal because their basic thinking and mindset is anti-dalit-muslim and anti-minority
 isi vajah se bijepi ke raaj main har tarah se bhedbhaav, hinsa or hatya kaa bolbalaa he
 Mayawati advised the Sangh that it would first have to change its hatred and communal thinking to become humanitarian under the Constitution, which till date these people have not been able to do
 isiilie samaaj main unki sweekaaryata kaa abhaav bana hua he
 Taking a dig at the Sangh, Mayawati also said that if her thinking and mindset were for the same human, constitutional and public interest, she would not have to be banned thrice after independence

 Namdar, Kamdar, Damdar or any average sensible PM can become, if he has the strength and support
 ham is par itnaa ho-hallaa kyon machaa rahe hai
 Anyway, this is his internal matter and anyone can become PM only after securing majority
 Anybody can become PM in our democracy
 Naamdar, Kaamdar, Daamdar or for that matter any average Samajhdar, if he has the numbers & support
 Why are we making such a hue and cry about it? After all isn’t it their internal matter & any pmship has to be through verdict of majority

 However Sir, it's a matter of our people, our politics and our latest policies "so less said the better"
