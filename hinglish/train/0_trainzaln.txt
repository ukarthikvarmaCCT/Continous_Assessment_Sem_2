 nyaayamurti eke patnayak or nyaayamurti jees khehar kii peeth ne unki jamaanat yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha ki isamen koi thos aadhaar nahin he
 The bench rejected his review petition saying, "we do not see any merit in the review petition and are not ready to interfere with the decision of the lower court
" ‚Äôhaalanki, peeth ne sarvasammati se faisla kiya, lekin nyaayamurti patnayak ne nichali adaalat ke faisle ke kuch hisson main kuch khaas khaamiyon ko ullekith karne ke liye alag se faisla likhane ko variyata di
 The bench, however, did not feel the need to interfere in the process of issuing the order of the special court given the entire circumstances and detailed reasons

 The CBI strongly opposed Nupur's petitions

 His throat was severed

 On paper, it is believed that the Samajwadi party-bahujan Samaj Party alliance will be in a strong position by attracting other backward classes and Dalits
 obisi main mukhya rup se yadav sapa kaa or daliton main se jatav basapa kaa mukhya janaadhar hai jabaki bhartiya janata party savarnon ke vot par apni pakad rakhti he or yah uskaa mul vot bank he
 On this basis, it can be said that Congress has no base vote bank except for Muslims and Muslims have also been giving votes to SP and BSP in the last elections by flipping the hand of Congress
 haalanki, desh kii yah sabase puraani party mukhya rup se musalamaanon or savarnon kaa vishwaas jeetne ke lakshya ke saath har jati samooh main apana samarthan aadhaar taiyaar karne ke liye jaateey card badi chaturaai se khel rahi he
 Analysis of Trivedi Center for Political Data at Ashoka University shows the influence of upper castes in UP politics
 haalanki savarna rajya ke kul matadaataaon main se keval 19 pratishat hai, par vartmaan vidhansabha main 44 pratishat vidhayak unke bich se aate hai
 Party insiders hope that with Priyanka Gandhi's accession, the Congress will snatch away traditional BJP voters who are unhappy with the saffron party but will not support the SP-BSP alliance
 congress ne pashchimi uttar pradesh kii adhikansh siton par apane ummidavaar ek badi ranneeti ke tahat utaare hai
 The Congress does not see its prospects very good here, so it has been trying to divide the BJP votes so that the SP-BSP alliance can benefit
 masalan meerut ko len, jahaan baniyaa samudaay ke kareeb 2,50,000 matadaata hai
 The party has fielded Harendra Agarwal, son of former Chief Minister Banarsi Das, against two-time BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal
 congress kaa uddeshy yahaan baniyaa voton main vibhaajan karake basapa netaa or gathbandhan ke ummidavaar haji yaqub kuraishi kii jeet ko aasaan bananaa he
 In Bihar, the Congress is a partner of Lalu's grand alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and other parties and is contesting on only nine of the state's 40 seats
 usne rajya kii rajdhani patna main poster lagaae jisamen unke netaaon kii jati or dharm bataaya gaya tha
 The posters were posted a week after the All India Congress Committee restructured its Bihar unit and appointed two upper-caste leaders to the top positions in the party
 is kadam ko ucch jati ke matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke prayaas ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 The upper castes once used to be traditional Congress voters in Bihar, but in the 1990s they switched sides with the Congress and started supporting the BJP
 maharashtra main, jahaan haal ke dinon main daliton ke vyapak virodh pradarshan hue hai, congress-rashtravaadi congress party gathbandhan khud ko nuksaan main dekh rahaa he ki vah daliton ke bich majboot janaadhar rakhane vaali ramdaas athavle kii aguai vaali republican party of india(e) kaa vikalp nahin ban sakaa jo endie sarkaar kaa hissaa he
 There are 11 constituencies in Maharashtra where the population of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is more than 20 percent and in six seats they are more than 30 percent
 2014 main shivasena ne paanch main se do essi siten jiti thim jabaki baaki siten bhaajapa ne jiti thim

 vibie ke do pramukh ghatak- prakaash ambedkar ke netritv vaale bharip bahujan mahasang or asaduddin ovaisi kii akhil bhartiya majalis-e-ittehadul musalamin hai
 The VBA has also joined the OBC by becoming a group of Dalits, tribes, obcs and Muslims
 maharashtra main obisi main 250 se zyada jatiyaan or up-jatiyaan hai or ye milakar aabaadi kaa lagbhag 52 pratishat hissaa hai
 The OBC vote is divided here
 2016 main jab maraathon ne 16 pratishat aarakshan kii maang kii to iske parinamswaroop maratha banaam obisi kaa dhruvikaran ho gaya
 The obcs are believed to be close to the bjp-shiv Sena alliance while the Marathas are close to the congress-ncp alliance

 However the move backfired and the Lingayats have not yet forgiven Siddaramaiah or the Congress for this effort

 The country's politics may revolve around issues such as development, corruption, unemployment, farmers' crises and national security, but votes are being sought on ethnic lines in a fragmented electoral battle

 Recently, the National Green Tribunal has received all kinds of guidelines from the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court to remove environmental pollution, but these examples of green tax only show that it is not so easy to clean the environment

 Speaking on the work of the last four years of the Modi government's tenure, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh said that we have decided not to carry out operations against terrorists during the month of Ramadan so that this holy month should pass properly
 'panchayat ajtak' kaarykram main rajnath singh ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad se pakistan apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he, lekin hamaari sena unka munhtod jawaab de rahi he
 In response to the question whether Pakistan is learning a lesson, he said that Pakistan has not learned the lesson but if the circumstances remain the same, then it will definitely learn the lesson in future
 unhone kaha ki antarrashtriya samudaay ke saamne paak aatankwaad ko panaah dene kii jagah ke rup main ujagar hua he
 On the question of continuous firing on the international border and the government's decision to ceasefire in the month of Ramadan, he said that the government has taken this decision very thoughtfully
 rajnath ne kaha, 'main samajhataa hum ki kashmir bhi hamaara he
 Kashmiris also belong to us
 ramajaan kaa paavan maheenaa bina kisi local vyakti kii maut ke thik tarah se biit jaae isliye hamane yah faisla liya he
 'rajnath said,' It is not that if the terrorists attack the army, then the soldiers of the army will sit with their hands folded
 aaj hi 5 aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 It is not necessary that terrorists will support your every program and move
 bidambnaa ye he ki hamaare is faisle ke baad pakistan ko jaisaa aacharan dikhaanaa chahie tha vaisaa aacharan vahaan se dikhaa nahin
 Pakistan has also broken the hopes of Pakistani Muslim people living in India
 unhen ummid thi ki bharat ke is faisle ke baad pakistan bhi aisa hi aacharan dikhayega lekin lagaataar golibari kar unhone apane desh ke logon kii ummiido ko bhi tod diya he

 In this day-long panchayat at Hotel Taj Palace in New Delhi, ministers of the Modi government will present their report cards
 narendra modi phir se mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 No, no need to be shocked
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki modi nenithish kumaar kopradhanmantri pad ofer kiya he
 These initiatives and offers were made by Modi when he came to Delhi to participate in a meeting of Chief Ministers regarding Nitish Kumar Ganga
 nitish kumaar ko is bare main soch samaj kar faisla karne ko kaha gaya he
 For those who see a new idea for Nitish, it is said that he had a wonderful view
 nitish kumaar itane bhav-vihval to us din bhi nahin hue the, jab barason baad wo lalu prasad yadav se mili
 When faced with face, this time also Modi extended his hand
 pehle to der tak donon puure lay main haath milaate rahe - balki mil kar haath hilaate rahe
 Then as suddenly remembered and jerked away, they hugged each other
 teji to aisi thi ki laga baraak bhi dosti kii is res main kaaphi peeche chhot gaya ho
 Poor Barak
 jubaan chup thi, baaten ankhon se ho rahi thi
 Only for a moment, it felt like once again someone said, 'just do it, will you make me cry?' Whose voice was it, no one could understand? Then Nitish said, 'don't go to TV Bite
 mujhe prapojal manjuur he
 To forget to take the mistake
 ab aage se aisa nahin hoga
 i am ready to re-align for Bihar
 ''lekin main to taiyaar nahin hum naa,' modi ne saaf manaa kar diya, 'ye sab aap bhul jaaie
 See, i have some idea for everyone
 maine aapke liye bhi soch rakhaa he
 Just you think
 aakhir faisla to aapako hi karnaa hoga
 Modi's offer to Nitish made three offers to Nitish
 or daad deni padegi himmat kii
 Really only Modi can give such bizarre but true type offers, slowly, most people are now accepting this
 ofer number 1: modi ne nitish se kaha ki wo chahen to tatkaal prabhaav se rail mantri ban sakate hai
 The way Suresh Prabhu was picked up from Shiv Sena, called from Mumbai and joined BJP on the same day and made a minister by evening - the same can be done for Nitish
 suresh ji ko kuch or daayitv saunpa ja saktaa he
 Offer number 2: On hearing Modi's second offer, Nitish felt gush would fall, but somehow he managed himself
 modi bole, 'aap chahen to main abhi aapako pradhanmantri pad ofer kar saktaa hum
 Then Modi said that this offer is valid even before the assembly elections
 uske baad wo kuch nahin kar sakate
 Nitish could not understand anything
 phir modi ne vistaar se samajhaayaa
 Modi said that for this the government will bring an ordinance which will have a new provision
 nai vyavastha main rajyon main mukhyamantri kaa pad khatm kar diya jayega or vahaan unki jagah pradhanmantri kaa pad hoga
 The reasoning is that the main post should be only one - hence the name of the Prime Minister will be changed to the Chief Minister
 phir desh main sirf ek mukhyamantri hoga or baaki saare pradhanmantri
 Modi is also going to make such an offer to the current chief ministers of other parties
 isse se har kisi ke pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana puraa ho jayega - or sabake sab modi ke ahasaanamand honge
 Offer number 3: The third offer was for Nitish only
 lekin iske liye nitish ko 2024 tak intjaar karnaa padegaa, jab tak modi khud pradhanmantri bane rahenge
 After that Modi will get the constitution amended and create a new post for himself
 ye nayaa pad head of da state hoga, jiske paas saare adhikaar honge
 Tellers are telling that Modi has given Nitish 15 days with the offer
 gend ab nitish ke paale main he, jabaki laddu modi ke donon haathon main
 Modi's master stroke informs that Modi has hit many targets with one stone
 nitish ko ye ofer dekar modi ne na sirf bihar main bijepi ke liye rasta aasaan banane kii koshish kii he balki astitv main aane se pehle hi janata parivaar ko target kiya he
 Nitish's party is a strong link of the JDU Janata Parivar
 jammu kashmir kii tarj par bihar ko vishesh darja dene ke baad modi ise aanevaale vidhansabha chunaavon main bhunaane kii koshish karenge

 log besabri se modi kaa bhaashan shuru hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The biggest target of Modi in the Mission 2014 is UP
 varanasi kii is sabha main taiyaar kiye gaye 80 foot ke manch se modi sirf banaras hi nahin, samooche purvanchal ke logon ko sambodhit karnaa chaahate hai
 Modi is eyeing 14 Lok Sabha seats in this area
 narendra modi kii varanasi raily kii khaas baat yah he ki ve sirf raily karke hi nahin lautenge
 Before the rally, Modi performed pooja at the Sankatmochan temple
 iske baad unhone baba vishwanath ke darshan kiye
 It is clear that Modi's agenda can once again be 'hinduism dissolving' in UP politics through Varanasi
 narendra modi is raily main purvanchal ke pichhadepan ke saath hi guuruuvaar ko hi kebinet se manjuur hue jat aarakshan ke mudde par bhi garaj sakate hai
 Actually, UP is also a challenge for Modi, because in the three states where BJP has won the election in four states, no one has considered Modi as the 'general of Victory'
 sabhi kah rahe hai ki yadi modi ko tamgaa chahie, to haare hue maidaanon se hira laakar dikhaae
 Perhaps that's why Modi has reached Benaras to seek Shankar's support to recover from the shock

 Before the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government at the Center, all kinds of data were claimed about black money in foreign banks
 pro
 Arun Kumar says that black money goes into 6 layers abroad and there are total 90 tax havens in the world
 is bich panama papers, paradise papers, british varjeenia papers, echesbisi li jaise maamle saamne aae
 What the Swiss bank also revealed was very less
 in khulaason main kuch hajaar logon ke naam saamne aae
 While their number is in millions
 jinka sarkaar pataa nahin laga pai
 This happened because black money wandered from one tax haven to another and has also come back through investment in some countries
 professor arun kumaar bataate hai ki bade-bade ghotaalon kaa pataa 4-5 saal baad chalata he
 Like 2G in UPA-1, coal scam was detected during UPA-2
 isliye maujuuda sarkaar main ghotaale hue yaa nahin iskaa pataa bhi hamen 4-5 saal baad hi chalegaa
 It cannot be said right now that there was no scam in this government
 di-mat or vyapam jaise bade maamle hamaare saamne hai
 Therefore, Arun Kumar believes that from the formation of SIT till today, there was no significant success in curbing black money
 log nae niyamon kii jatilta kaa phayda uthaate hue apana rasta nikaalte rahe
 Citing the complexity of earning black, Prof
 arun kumaar ne bataaya ki maan lijie kisi vyapaaree ke kai saare petrol pump hai, jinka 1 din kaa turnover 1 karod he
 And he deposits Rs 25 crore in the bank in 25 days
 to isamen yah pataa laga paanaa mushkil he ki kahin in 25 karod main kuch raashi kisi or kaa kaala dhan to nahin
 Similarly, if a doctor sees 50 patients in a day and declares only 20 patients, then the money coming from 30 patients is black money but it will be difficult to prove it
 vastu evam seva kar yani jiesti lagu karte samay sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki isse kaale dhan par ankush lagegaa
 But this did not happen, people made black money through e-way bill by creating fake companies
 agenda ajtak ke kaarykram main shirkat karte hue pashchim bengal ke vitt mantri or jiesti parishad ke sadsy amit mitra ne bataaya tha ki unka adhyayan bataata he ki jiestiar-3bi main invais nahin hone se jiesti kii swachaalit digitikrut prakiya puri tarah se hastchalit kaam ho gaya, jiske jariye havala kaarobaar ho rahaa he, kyonki aap isamen invais nahin lagaate hai or isaki jaanch kaa koi tarika nahin he

 com / 6hunevicx3 Amarinder made it clear in a statement here on Sunday that it is not enough to make the corridor early enough, but the devotees need to be given the facility of 'open darshan' by crossing the border and waiving passport and visa requirements
 mukhyamantri ne chinhit kiya, "passport or vija kii shart bina passport vaale hajaaron bhakton, visheshkar punjab ke gramin ilaakon main rahane vaale logon ko pehle sikh guru ke jivan se jude aitihaasik gurudware main shraddha arpit karne kii unki ichha ko puraa karne se rokatii he
 "he said," The central government can easily grant these non-passport holders access to the gurdwara by waiving the passport and visa conditions and use other documents instead of passports and visas to verify the identity of the pilgrims
 
 "mukhyamantri ne kaha, "galiyare par pratibandhit pahunch ke saath yatra behad hi simit hogi or gurudwara ke liye yah ek ucch suraksha vaala maarg hoga, jisase sarkaar ko passport or vija kii shart ko samaapt karne main aasaan hogi

 ) bisisiai ne zimbabwe daure ke liye jo bhartiya team chuni he, usamen agar captain mahendra singh dhoni ko chhod diya jaae to ye bharat kii bi team hi he
 The stance that the BCCI has played to give young players a chance to give rest to the tired players from the IPL may also backfire
 beshak zimbabwe kii team duusari antarrashtriya tiimon ke mukaable kamjor he, phir bhi is team ke saath captain dhoni ke zimbabwe main paseene chhot sakate hai
 Learn why visiting Zimbabwe will be difficult for Team India
 
 
 1
 Except for the inexperienced team, all the players in the team are those who have not played international cricket yet
 is team ke jin khilaadiyon ne international cricket kheli bhi he, unka bhi anubhav koi bahut khaas nahin he
 This is also the first time for Dhoni, when he will take charge of an absolutely inexperienced team
 2
 Dhoni, captain Dhoni has not been to Zimbabwe for 11 years, although he has a long experience of playing international cricket, but he has also visited Zimbabwe only once
 dhoni apane kariyar main sirf ek baar 2005 main zimbabwe gaye the, jab unhone vahaan lagaataar teen maichon main teen ardhashatak lagaae the
 Dhoni also did not play in Zimbabwe as a captain as Team India captain Captain Ganguly in 2005
 3
 Despite the good performance, it is difficult to get a chance, except for Jasprit Bumrah, Akshar Patel, Ambati Rayudu and Manish Pandey, most of the players in this team are very difficult to find a place in the Indian team despite the big performance in Zimbabwe
 bhartiya cricketer bhi is baat ko samajhate hai ki zimbabwe main kitna bhi acha pradarshan kar len, lekin unhen aage aane vaali kisi siries main aswin, dhoni, kohli or rahane jaise cricketron kii jagah to team main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 So how will the cricketers play in Zimbabwe with strong spirits? 4
 halaat main dhaalane kaa nahin milegaa maukatim india sirf das din main vanade or twanti 20 siries khelegi
 Even before the tour started, no schedule of practice matches has been revealed yet
 aise main bhartiya khilaadi do maheene ipel khilne ke baad zimbabwe ke halaat main khud ko kaise dhaalenge? do maichon ke bich main ek din se zyada kaa antar nahin he
 It is a matter of honor that all the matches are held in Harare, otherwise one day in the middle would have gone from one city to another
 5
 Lessons not taken from previous tours, the mistake of taking Zimbabwe lightly was also made by Team India in 2010, when India could not make it to the finals due to losing both matches of the three-match ODI series to Zimbabwe on their own soil
 us daure main to phir bhi team main viraat kohli, suresh raina, rohit sharma or amit mishra jaise khilaadi thi
 This time the whole team is new
 2015 main bhi team india zimbabwe se ek tii 20 match haari thi
 Till now, people of Lucknow were watching the news on TV about how the deadly pollution in Delhi is like a mist in the air
 lekin ravivaar se yahaan bhi haalat ye he is shahar ke log kahana bhul gaye hai muskurie ki aap lakhanu main hai
 Winters have not started properly yet but there is a fog of dust and smoke all around and there is an evening-like atmosphere in the day itself
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki yah koharaa nahin balki smog he
 Much pollution in Lucknow has never been recorded until recently
 pradooshan kaa record todate hue lakhanu main particulate meter (piem 10) ravivaar ko 1200 tak pahunch gaya
 The PM 250, considered the most dangerous, which should be below 60 reached 633 on Sunday at 9:00 am
 aamtaur par lakhanu main piem 250 kaa level 100 ke aas-paas hota he lekin ravivaar ko puure din kaa ausat 350 ke upar tha
 This level of pollution is more than the day of Diwali
 diwali ke din yah 300 se neeche tha
 The Chief Environmental Officer of the State Pollution Board, SR Sachan, says the main reason is the change in weather
 hawa kii gati achaanak behad kam ho gai he, nami bad gai he or mausam bhi kuch thanda ho gaya he
 Due to these three reasons together, the pollution in the city is stuck here
 visheshgy bataate hai ki is tarah ke pradooshan se dharaatal par ozon banane lagata he
 The ozone umbrella in the atmosphere protects us from ultraviolet rays, but ozone is extremely dangerous for health
 pehle diwali uske baad shahar main akhilesh yadav kii rathyatra or uske baad samaajawaadee party ke raily kii vajah se hajaaron atirikt gaadiyaan shahar main ain, puure shahar main ghanton trephic jam laga rahaa jisase sthiti or badtar ho gai
 But not only Lucknow, there is news of similar haze from many districts of the state
 iske baavjood shahar main kai jagah kooda jalaae jane or gaanv main kai jagah par kheton main aag lagaae jane par roak nahin lagaai ja saki he
 The government does not seem to take any steps to stop pollution, people just hope that if the weather changes, maybe there will be some relief from this poisonous air

 Both these trains were express trains of name

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aaj rajasthan ke churu main ek raily main bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul said that BJP gets hurt under the conspiracy and it deliberately sets fire
 unhone kaha ki bijepi gussa dilaati he or ham shant karte hai
 i speak of brotherhood and love and reduce public anger and pain
 apane bhaashan main rahul ne apni daadi kii hatya kii bhi baat uthaai
 Rahul said that he would be murdered one day just as Grandma and Papa were murdered
 rahul ne kaha ki madhya pradesh ke bhaashan main maine apane dil kii baat kahi thi, jisamen maine apni maa (sonia gandhi) kii kahani bataai thi
 When i returned to Delhi, my mother told me, why do you tell my story, tell me what is my pain, that is my pain
 chalo aaj phir main apni kahani bataata hum
 Generally speaking, there is no talk of the heart, it is about development or other things
 rahul ne kaha ki bijepi ke log hindu-musalmaan kii ladaai karavaate hai
 i speak against it
 andar kaa kaaran aaj main aapako bataane vaala hum ki aisa kyon karata hum? Rahul told that my father (rajiv Gandhi) used to make laws for us, but my grandmother (indira Gandhi) used to protect me from these laws
 jaise mujhe paalak acha nahin lagata tha, to daadi teble par akhbaar khol detii thim to main paalak unki plate main kar detaa tha
 i also had two-three friends
 ve meri daadi kii dekhbhaal karte the
 One name Satwant Singh and the other's Beant Singh
 unhone mujhe badminton khelnaa sikhaaya
 We had very good friendships
 unamem meraa bharosa tha
 One day in 1984, Beant Singh came to me and asked me two-three questions
 unhone kaha ki tumhaari daadi kahaan soti he, phir unhone mujhase poocha ki aapako kya lagata he ki aapaki daadi kii suraksha main koi kami to nahin he
 He also said that if you ever throw a grenade at you, you should lie down like this
 us samay main 14 saal kaa tha to samaj nahin aayaa tha
 Years later, i came to know that Satwant Singh and Beant Singh and others before Dadi's murder wanted to throw a hand grenade over Dadi in Diwali
 uske baad daadi kii hatya hui
 Everyone knows what happened next
 khayr agle din jab main uthaa to skool gaya to bhugol kii class chal rahi thi
 i did not like studying, i was looking outside
 phir meri teacher ke paas ek aadmi aayaa or usase baat ke baad teacher ne kaha ki tumhen ghar janaa he
 When i went home, it was found that the grandmother had died
 wo jo dard mujhe us din hua
 
 
 
 phir vah dard mujhe papa kii maut par hua
 Like someone tore the chest
 rahul ne kaha ki daadi kii maut kii khabar se mere pair kaanp rahe the
 When i took sister Priyanka from school to home, it was very painful to see grandmother and another blood with her
 kaaphi saalon tak mujhe dil main beant or satvant ke prati bahut gussa tha
 It took me 10 to 15 years to understand that anger
 jo aaj yahaan hamaare sikh bhai baithe hai, unamem ab gussa khatm ho gaya
 Anger takes years to dissipate, and minutes to turn
 udhaaharan dekar rahul ne kaha ki mere kamare main kuch maheene pehle punjab ke ek emele aae
 Before leaving he tells me that i cannot believe that today i am sitting in your room
 maine jab iskaa kaaran poocha to usne bataaya ki aap mujhe 20 saal pehle mili hote to main aapako jaan se maar detaa, lekin aaj aapke saath baitha hum or aapako gale laga saktaa hum
 Anger is instilled in people
 isliye main bijepi kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf hum
 He hurts people for political gain
 main mujffarnagar gaya tha
 Met hindu-muslims there
 unke dukh main mujhe apana cheharaa dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Therefore, i am against such politics
 ye log mujffarnagar main aag lagaate hai, gujarat main lagaate hai or kashmir main lagaate hai
 We have to cool this fire, hold the hands of the youth
 aag lagane se desh kaa nuksaan hota he
 Rahul said, hit my grandmother, hit my father and maybe one day i will kill me too
 
 
 lekin mujhe isse koi fark nahin padataa

 Former French President Fran√ßois Hollande has made a statement that could create a storm in the Rafale case
 france kii media main oland kaa yah bayaan kaaphi sansani failaa chukaa he
 Journalists from there are tweeting this statement of Francois Hollande
 yah ek aisa bayaan he jo rafel maamle main sarkaar ko nae sire se katghare main khadaa karti he
 You will remember that when Prime Minister Modi visited France in April 2015, Fran√ßois Hollande was the President
 unheen ke saath rafel vimaan kaa qaraar hua tha
 a newspaper named 'mediapart France' asked former President Fran√ßois Hollande who chose Reliance and why, then Fran√ßois Hollande said that we had no option to choose a partner
 bharat kii sarkaar ne hi reliance ko prastaavit kiya
 Dasso tied up with Anil Ambani
 hamaare paas koi chaara nahin tha
 We were working with the middleman who was given to us
 main to kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa ki iskaa sambandh film juli gaaiye hoga
 Jule Guyye has been the girlfriend of Fran√ßois Hollande
 bharat main to isi baat par aag lag jaae magar garlfrand kii film main bhartiya company ke nivesh ke taar bhi rafel deal se jode ja rahe hai
 This is the first time a serious statement has been made about the Anil Ambani group
 ab yah aarope aarope se zyada ho jaataa he
 Now the Indian government will have to answer the question on whose behalf the name of Ambani was sent to the French government
 kis str par bheja gaya
 Before this, there were discussions in several committees made of this deal
 kya raksha maamalon ke cabinet kamity main ambani kii francwa oland kaa yah bayaan saadhaaran nahin he
 You are seeing in this picture
 yah tabhi kii he jab pradhanmantri modi paris gaye the
 He is accompanied by the then President Fran√ßois Hollande
 10 april 2015 kaa din he ye
 16 days before the same deal comes the statement of the CEO of Rafale, who made Rafale, that he is in talks with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 march 2014 ke bich donon ke bich qaraar hua tha ki bharat main 108 ladaaku vimaan banegaa or 70 fisadi kaam echeel ko milegaa
 But two days before the deal, the name of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited disappears
 prashanth bhushan ne apane press conference main aarope lagaaya tha jise baar-baar rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki kroni capatlist ko laabh pahunchane ke liye echeel ko deal se hataa diya gaya
 Reliance comes under the defense deal
 yahi nahin prashanth bhushan ne 8 april 2015 ke din bharat ke videsh sachiv ke ek bayaan kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 Prior to Prime Minister Modi's visit to India, the Foreign Secretary said that my understanding about Rafael is that discussions are going on between the French company, our Ministry of Defense and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 ye sabhi technical or detail charchaa he
 We do not include defense deals in the journey at the leadership level
 wo alag hi trek par chal rahaa hota he
 So you saw that the deal happens on 10 April 2015
 uske do din pehle 8 april ko videsh sachiv ke anusaar echeel deal main shaamil he
 According to a statement by Dasso Aviation 14 days earlier, the state- owned HAL was involved in the deal
 ab yahaan sawaal aata he ki reliance dephence kii entry kab hoti he
 At whose behest rahul gandhi isi ko lekar lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai
 Due to which Anil Ambani's company has also claimed defamation on the Congress party
 to purv raashtrapati francwa oland ke bayaan ke baad yah maamla kahaan pahunchataa he
 The government has repeatedly said that it had no role in the Reliance Defense case
 yahi baat reliance dephence ne media ko die apane jawaab main kaha tha ki videshi vendorus ke bhartiya parteners ke chayan main raksha mantralay kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Since 2005, 50 offset contracts have been signed
 sab main ek hi prakriya apanaai gai he
 Our colleague Vishnu Som has also approached Reliance Defense and Ministry of Defense for their response
 jawaab kaa intazaar he
 At present, the tweet of the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense has come
 francwa oland kaa bayaan isliye bhi mahatvapurn he, kyonki deal unheen ke vakt hui thi jab ve raashtrapati the
 He says that we had no option to choose a partner
 bharat kii sarkaar ne hi reliance ko prastaavit kiya
 Dasso made a pact with Ambani
 hamaare paas koi chaara nahin tha
 We were working with the middleman who was given to us
 main to kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa ki iskaa sambandh film juli gaaiye hoga
 Now go to 'india Today' website
 8 march 2018 kii ek khabar milegi, jisamen bharat kii yatra par aane se pehle france ke raashtrapati emanuele maikron kehete hai ki agar narendra modi kii sarkaar is deal se sambandhit kuch samvedansheel soochnaaon ko saajha karnaa chaahati he to france etraz nahin karegaa
 He also said that this agreement was not done during his tenure but was in the interest of both countries
 bharat or france ke bich rafel deal ke pehle aarthik, audyogic or ranneetik hiton par kaaphi vichaar vimarsh kiya gaya he
 The Rafale Deal controversy is important with two questions
 ek ki ek rafel vimaan kitne kaa he
 The Congress alleges that the Modi government has bought 1000 crores more than the time of UPA so that a particular industrialist can be benefited
 doosraa vivaad he ki khaas udyogpati ko phayda pahunchane ke pehle deal se kuch hafte pehle ek nai company banaai jaati he
 The new company has no experience in aircraft manufacturing
 jis hindustan aronotics limited ne sukhoi 30 jaise vimaan banaae hai use deal se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 The comments anil ambani group kii company ko saajheedaar banaae jane ke congress ke hamale ke baad arun jetali jo ki vitt mantri hai wo blog likhte hai
 It is said that Jaitley answers how a private company came to the deal
 kehete he ki upie ke samay hi shart bani thi ki jo mul nirmaataa company he wo bharat main kalpurzon kii aapurti yaa rakrakhaav ke liye khud se bhartiya company ko saajheedaar bana sakati he
 It has nothing to do with the government
 lekin iskaa jawaab nahin mila ki rafel banane vaali dasso avishan company kyon ek aisi company ko saajheedaar banaaegi, jiskaa is kshetra main anubhav kaaphi nayaa he or aarope he ki vah company kuch hi maheene pehle vajood main ai he
 Jaitley does not touch this aspect
 jetali ne apane blog main is baat kaa jawaab diya he ki deal sin se pehle 14 maheene tak Price Negotiation Committee or Contract Negotiation Committee ne is par vichaar vimarsh kiya he
 Cabinet Committee on Security approved
 prashanth bhushan, yashavanth sinha or arun shouri lagaataar press conference karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi has continuously made several press conferences and tweets on this
 nirmala sitaraman ne bhi jawaab dena shuru kiya he
 He recently said that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was pulled out of the deal because HAL did not have the capacity
 jule gaaiye francwaan oland kii garlfrand rahi hai
 In India, the same thing can be ignited, but the wires of the investment of the Indian company in the girlfriend's film are also being linked to the Rafale Deal
 yah pehali baar he jab anil ambani group ko lekar gambhir bayaan aayaa he
 Now this accusation becomes more than the accusation
 ab bharat sarkaar ko is sawaal kaa jawaab dena hoga ki ambani kaa naam kiski taraf se france sarkaar ko bheja gaya
 At what level was it sent
 iske pehle kya is deal ke bani kai cametiyon main charchaa hui thi
 Is it not a simple statement by Francois Hollande of Ambani in the Cabinet Committee on Defense
 aap is tasviir main dekh rahe hai
 This is only when Prime Minister Modi visited Paris
 unke saath tab ke raashtrapati francwa oland hi hai
 It is the day of 10 April 2015
 isi deal ke 16 din pehle rafel banane vaali dasso aviation ke siio kaa bayaan aata he ki hindustan aironotics limited se baat ho rahi he
 Between March 2014, the two had signed an agreement that 108 fighter aircraft would be built in India and 70 per cent of the work would go to HAL
 lekin is deal se do din pehle hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam gaayab ho jaataa he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged in his press conference that Rahul Gandhi had repeatedly said that HAL was removed from the deal to benefit the crony capitalist
 reliance dephence deal ke bheetar aa jaati he
 Not only this, Prashant Bhushan also referred to a statement of the Foreign Secretary of India on 8 April 2015
 pradhanmantri modi ke bharat daure se pehle videsh sachiv ne kaha tha ki rafel ko lekar meri samaj yah he ki french company, hamaara raksha mantralay or hindustan aironotics limited ke bich charchaa chal rahi he
 This is all technical and detail discussion
 netritv ke str par jo yatra hoti he, usamen ham raksha saudon ko lekar shaamil nahin karte hai
 He is walking on a different track
 to aapane dekha ki 10 april 2015 ko deal hoti he
 According to the Foreign Secretary, HAL is involved in the deal on April 8, two days before that
 uske 14 din pehle dasso aviation ke bayaan ke anusaar sarkari company echeel deal main shaamil he
 Now here comes the question, when is the entry of Reliance Defense
 kiske ishaare par hoti he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly accusing this
 jiske kaaran anil ambani kii company ne congress party par manahani kaa daawa bhi kiya he
 So where does this matter reach after the statement of former President Fran√ßois Hollande
 sarkaar baar-baar kah chuki he ki reliance dephence ke maamle main uski koi bhoomika nahin thi
 This is what Reliance Defense said in its reply to the media that the Ministry of Defense has no role in the selection of Indian partners of foreign vendors
 2005 se abhi tak 50 ofaset kantrect sin ho chuke hai
 The same procedure has been adopted in all
 hamaare sahyogi vishnu som ne reliance dephence or raksha mantralay se bhi unki pratikriya ke liye sampark kiya he
 Awaiting reply
 philhal raksha mantralay ke pravaktaa kaa twit aayaa he
 Fran√ßois Hollande's statement is also important because the deal was made when he was president
 unka kahana he ki hamaare paas partner chunane kaa koi vikalp nahin tha
 The Government of India proposed Reliance
 dasso ne ambani ke saath samjhauta kiya
 We had no choice
 ham us madhyasth ke saath kaam kar rahe the jo hamen diya gaya tha
 i cannot even imagine that it would be related to the film Julie
 ab aap 'india today' kii website par jaaiye
 On March 8, 2018, before receiving a visit to India, French President Emmanuel Macron said that France would not object if Narendra Modi's government wanted to share some sensitive information related to this deal
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki yah samjhauta unke kaarykaal main nahin hua tha magar donon deshon ke hit main tha
 Before the Rafale deal between India and France, considerable economic, industrial and strategic interests have been discussed
 rafel deal kaa vivaad do sawaalon ko lekar mahatvapurn he
 How much is a Rafale aircraft? congress kaa aarope he ki upie ke samay kii tulana main modi sarkaar ne 1000 karod zyada dekar kharida he taaki kisi khaas udyogpati ko phayda pahunchaaya ja sake
 The second controversy is that a new company is formed a few weeks before the first deal to benefit the particular industrialist
 nai company kaa vimaan nirmaan ke sambandh main koi anubhav nahin he
 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, which has manufactured aircraft like Sukhoi 30, is put out of the deal
 tippaniyan Arun Jaitley, who is the finance minister, writes a blog after the Congress's attack on the Anil Ambani Group company to partner
 kehete hai ki jetali iskaa jawaab dete hai ki deal main koi privet company kaise aa gai
 It is said that the condition was made at the time of UPA that the original manufacturer company can partner itself with the Indian company to supply or maintain the components in India
 iskaa sarkaar se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 But the answer could not be found as to why the Dasso Avision company, which makes Rafale, would partner a company whose experience in this field is quite new and it is alleged that the company came into existence only a few months ago
 jetali is pahalu ko nahin choote hai
 Jaitley has responded in his blog that the Price Negotiation Committee and Contract Negotiation Committee have discussed this for 14 months before the deal sign
 cabinet kamity on security kii majuri lee gai
 Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie hold frequent press conferences
 rahul gandhi ne lagaataar is par kai press conference or twit kiye hai
 Nirmala Sitharaman has also started answering
 unhone haal hi main kaha tha ki hindustan aronotics limited ko isliye deal se baahar kiya gaya, kyonki echeel ke paas kshamta nahin thi

 puraa juluus kaaphi lanbaa tha
 At the forefront were 18 Gajraj, then the tableau of Indian culture on about 100 trucks, then doing 30 odd exercises and doing various tricks and then many bhajan mandalis singing different hymns related to God
 or unke peeche bhagwaan jagannatha kaa rath

 The Prime Minister said, 'personally i think if Ambedkar had not been there, where would Narendra Modi have been
 ‚Äômodidow ambedakauntarrashtriya centre ke shilanyas ke maukey par bol rahe the
 He said that it would be an insult to Ambedkar if he was seen as the messiah of the deprived and exploited society
 bharat ke pehle kanoon mantri ambedkar ne puure maanav samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye kaam kiya tha
 Attacking the governments of the opposition parties at the Center for not giving due respect to Ambedkar, Modi said that this social reformer had faced social untouchability in his life and is also facing 'political untouchability' after his death
 
 ambedkar ke banaae samvidhan kii vajah se jo sarkarein baniin, unhen shaayad dow ambedkar antarrashtriya centre ke liye yojanaon ko antim rup dene main dikkat thi

 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter classroom main to har jagah bachche schuli dress pahane dikhte hai, lekin ab rajasthan shikshakon ke liye bhi dress code tay kii ja rahi he
 Dress code will be implemented in Rajasthan for the first time for 4 lakh teachers of the state
 shiksha mantri kaa suzav he ki rajasthan ke paaramparik vesh-bhusha dhoti-kurte main shikshak najar aaen
 What will be the dress code and how soon will the teachers wear this and come to teach the children, there will be a brainstorm on the subject in the education department headquarters of Jaipur Department next month
 yani saaf he ki 2018-19 me rajasthan ke sarkari skulon ke shikshak ek rang me aapako dikhenge
 a meeting has been called on 5 April to discuss the subject, in which a committee will be formed to decide the dress
 is dress manthan me tamaam aalaa adhikari shirkat karenge
 The intention of the government is that by looking at the dress, people will know that Guru Ji is there
 isse guru ji kaa sammaan bhi samaaj main badhegaa saath hi abhibhavakon ko bhi skool ke shikshakon se milane-julne main aasaani hogi
 By the way, the Education Minister suggests that Guru Ji should be seen in the traditional dhoti-dhoti-kurta of Rajasthan, but he says that the dress code will not be imposed on anyone
 iske liye export cameti banegi or vahi dress kaa nirdhaaran karegi
 a decision will also be taken on whether salwar shoots or sarees are for female teachers
 shiksha vibhaag kaa kahana he ki dress code lagu hone ke baad shikshakon ke apane man se koi bhi dress pahanane par pabandi lagegi
 One of the rationale of the education department behind the implementation of the dress code is that the teachers of government schools should appear in the Indian dress
 isse skulon main anushaasan or skool kii garima donon badhegi
 It is akin to the RSS uniform for children that the education department of Rajasthan has changed the uniforms of the children in government schools after twenty years, in this it has included brown colored half pants and light brown shirt for the students, while the students The salwar, skirt and sardine and shirt and kurta have been fixed in light brown color
 shiksha vibhaag ke daftar main sample uniform ke set rakhe ja rahe hai
 State Education Minister Vasudev Devnani is being accused of making a dress similar to the RSS dress
 haalanki sarkaar ne ye bhi faisla kiya he ki pehali se paanchavi tak ke bacchon ke liye skool dress kii anivaaryta khatm kar di gai he taaki nanhe chaatro or unke abhibhavakon ko boj na pade

 All political parties are paying tribute to the death of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the peak man of BJP
 aise main vipakshi dal congress ne atal ji ke nidhan par shok vyakt karte hue kaha ki atal the, atal hai or atal rahenge
 Click here to pay tribute to Atalji Congress President Rahul Gandhi also mourned the death of Atal ji by tweeting

 Millions of people loved and respected former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 Today India lost a great son
 Former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, was loved and respected by millions
 My condolences to his family & all his admirers
 We will miss him

 On the other hand, senior leader Sharad Yadav recalled Atalji that Vajpayee was fond of eating and feeding

 ‚Äî Yashwant Sinha (@yashwantsinha)august 16, 2018 Seeing Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan, you would think that they got what they wanted
 naam, paisa, khushhaal parivaar or wo sabakuch jisaki ek insaan khwaahish kar saktaa he
 But is the truth the same? Usually marriages in Bollywood do not last long
 pyaar ke sahare shuru hue rishte kuch hi samay main ladaai-jhagade ke saath khatm ho jate hai
 In such a situation, the pairing of Jaya and Amitabh is indeed an example, but is the truth the same as what we see? The film 'key and Ka' features a scene on Amitabh and Jaya
 jisamen amitabh or jaya tivi dekh rahe hai
 Arjun Kapoor's interview is going on TV
 jaya khush ho rahi hoti hai or amitabh naaraaz
 If you have not seen this film yet, then let us tell you that in the film, Arjun Kapoor has played the role of a husband who takes care of the house and his wife Kareena works in the film
 intervyuu dekhte hue jaya, amitabh se puuchhati hai ki kya wo aisa kar sakate the? is par amitabh kaa jawaab hota he, bilkul
 i could, but you wanted to stay at home and look at the children and the house, so you chose to leave work
 is par jaya jawaab detii hai ki maine ye sab isliye chunaa kyonki mere paas ise chunane ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp hi nahin tha
 FB 1296 - Balki sends me the promo, which he says he will keep for the rest of his life
 
 
 feel happy for him that 'ki & Ka" is doing well 
 
 Posted byamitabh Bachchanon Monday, April 4, 2016ye seen film kaa ek hissaa maatr he
 It may have been shot exclusively for the film
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki amitabh or jaya kii jindagi main ye sawaal kabhi khadaa hi nahin hua ho lekin ye sawaal he to ahm
 This is still the truth in most homes today
 shaadi se pehle ladkaa or ladakidonon hi apane kariyar main acha kar rahe hote hai
 Then both get married
 ladkaa shaadi ke baad bhi kariyar par focus karata he lekin ladki ko ghar kii jimmedaariyaan saunp di jaati hai
 If he can handle both home and office by becoming a robot, then it is fine, but if the house is getting a little high in the work, then the householders start giving him advice
 chhod do naukari, apana ghar dekhon
 It is more important
 koi usase ye nahin kahata ki ghar ke kaamon kii vajah se tumhaari naukari prabhavit ho rahi he
 Distribute household chores
 par sochie, agar yahi baat ek ladke se kahi jaae to wo kya karegaa or kya pratikriya degaa?saalon se chale aa rahe is sawaal kaa jawaab ab bhi nahin mil sakaa he lekin kuch ladkiyaan khushkismat bhi hoti hai jinhen ek aisa saath miltaa he jo ghar or baahar kii simaaon ko nahin maanata

 Actress Shilpa Shetty is being ridiculed on Twitter
 aisa us khabar ke prakashit hone ke baad ho rahaa he jisamen shilpa shetty ne kaha he ki jorge orwell kii prasiddh kitaab 'animal farm' bacchon kii kitaab he
 According to a newspaper report, Shilpa said that some books are such that children should be taught in school
 shilpa ne kaha, "animal farm jaisi kitaab bacchon ko jaanwaron se pyaar karnaa or unka khyaal rakhana sikhaa sakati he
 " bataa den ki angrezi sahitya kii duniya main jorge orwell kii 'enmil form' ko ek clasik kaa darja hasil he jisamen raajnneetik vyavastha par vyangy ksaa gaya he
 This story, created by portraying animals as animals, actually shows how the ruling party often fails to remove its own allies in order to remain in power
 jaanwaron ke bahaane se kahi gai yah dilachasp kahani aaj ke daur main bhi behad hi praasangik he or raajnneeti main hone vaali uthapatak ko badi hi saadagi or vyangy bhare andaaz main kah detii he
 Interestingly, earlier Orwell named this book as 'animal Form - a Fairy Story'
 lekin kai bade prakashkon ne is kahani ko chhapane se sirf isliye inkaar kar diya tha kyonki unhen laga ki 'bacchon kii kitabon' kaa bazaar bahut bada nahin he
 That is, many years before Shilpa Shetty, even big publishers were spoiled by the title of this book

 Let me tell you that George Orwell's 'enmil Form' in the world of English literature has a classic status in which satire is cast on the political system
 jaanwaron ko kirdaar banaate hue rachi gai yah kahani darasal dikhaati he ki kis tarah satta main bane rahane ke liye aksar sattadhari apane hi saathiyon ko rasta se hataane se nahin chukta
 This interesting story told by the pretext of animals is very relevant even today and tells the disturbance in politics in a very simplistic and satirical manner

 sidney main australia ( # indvaus # indvsaus)khilaaf pehle vanade (match report) main 34 ran se mili haar ke baad alag-alag pahaluon se haar kaa postmortem kiya ja rahaa he
 Someone is blaming three wickets in the beginning, one is on the decision of the umpire, another on something else
 lekin in sabake bich purv captain mahendra singh dhoni (mahendra Singh Dhoni) ne bhi cricketpremiyon hi nahin, unke kattar prashansakon ko bhi bahut zyada khafa kar diya he
 And a large number of fans have expressed their displeasure over Dhoni's batting on social media
 inkaa kahana he ki dhoni ke andaaj kii vajah se hi sidney main bharat pehle vanade main haar gaya
 This morning is not happy for me
 Being an admirer of M
 s Dhoni, i am feeling very bad for him, as he is failing to score for India gain and and again
 
 and is in the rader of public criticism now
 So, My
 
 
 https: / / t
 co / yk0xpfv83jxoni sidney main lambey samay baat color jersey main team india ke liye khilne utre the
 And he also found the conditions so difficult that Dhoni came out for batting when India had lost their three wickets for just 4 runs
 aise main purv captain ne aade samay main rohit sharma ke saath milakar chauthe wicket ke liye 138 ran kii bhagidaari kii
 Dhoni also managed to make a half-century, but he left something that upset Indian cricket lovers
 fact- he might be good in the past but we need to concentrate on current form of player, it may be dhoni / dhawan / any other
 if he plays well there will be no chance to write against him
 when any player doesn't do well definitely there will be criticism
 darasal in cricketpremiyonka kahana he ki dhoni ne bahut hi zyada dhimi ballebaaji kii
 Well, they have a point because Rohit Sharma's strike rate is 103
 10 rahaa, to dhoni sirf 53
 Straw of 12
 rate se hi ran nikaal sake
 Cricket pundits also say that if Dhoni had scored at a strike rate around eighty, the result in the first ODI would have been different
 or dhoni ke dhimpen se jaruri ran ausat bahut zyada bad gaya
 By the way, there was one more thing against Dhoni who is famous for batting more than slow, which is being discussed loudly
 Brother
 
 Dhoni is perenially out of form
 
 he is blocking a slot of someone who can bat way better than him
 
 
 The criticism Dhoni is getting is not because one match where he scored at a slow pace
 He has been doing this for past 24 months and unable rotate strike
 Let us know that Dhoni has scored a half-century in odis for the first time since December 2017
 unhone pehle match main kul 96 gendon kaa saamana kiya, lekin sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah rahi ki isamen se 63 genden dot raheen
 Meaning Dhoni did not score any runs on these balls
 dhoni ne 33 gendon par hi score kiya
 Cricket fans were furious after the match that Dhoni wasted more than ten overs
 or yahi bharat kii haar kaa sabab bana kyonki shuruaati teen wicket jald gir jane ke baad bhi agar dhoni 63 main se aadhi hi gendon par score karte, to match kii kahani bharat ke paksh main hoti
 However, after the match, Rohit Sharma defended Dhoni saying that if one more wicket fell at this time, the match would have ended
 lekin yah baat kisi ko hajam nahin ho rahaa he
 Cricket fans say that Dhoni could have collected singles and doubles by playing ground shots on empty balls
 lekin nothan loyan ke saamne dhoni yah karne main naakaam rahe
 And its great value was that Dhoni played 63 dot balls
 or yah bharat kii haar kii vajah ban gaya

 This threat from Trump is frightening for environmentalists around the world
 puri duniya main yah koshish ho rahi he ki dharti ke badhate taapmaana ko rokane ke liye kaise carbon utsarjan kam kiya jaae or saura urja, pawan urja or newclear energy jaise madhyamon se bijli banaai jaae
 That is why last year, US President Barack Obama pushed for the Paris Deal before the end of his term so that this legacy could be associated with him

 The United States, European Union and china-india have the largest share of all the carbon emissions in the world today

 pichley saal hui paris deal main tamaam deshon ne apane lakshya bataae hai ki vah carbon imishan rokane ke liye or saaf suthri urja ke liye kya karenge
 Under this, efforts to limit the use of coal to make electricity and to move towards clean sources need a lot of money and technology
 trump ke netritv main america rukh is bare main kaaphi kuch tay karegaa
 However, according to the rules, the US cannot exit the Paris deal immediately
 use is prakriya main kareeb chaar saal lagenge or tab tak america raashtrapati pad ke liye nayaa chunaav ho rahaa hoga
