 hindu dharm main puja-paath ko lekar kai samay tay kiye gaye hai
 In such a situation, if you are unable to worship in the morning in the hurry to go to office, then you can worship in the evening
 lekin raat yaa shaam ko puja karte samay aapako khaas saavdhaaniyon kaa khyaal rakhana hoga, jisase aapke man or jivan main shanti bani rahe
 Goddess Aarti usually takes place at sunset
 lekin agar aap surya dub jane ke baad yaa raat hone par puja kar rahe hai to shankh or ghantiyaan naa bajaae
 Because it is night after sunset, the deities go to sleep
 - agar aap raat main puja karte hai to puja main istemaal phool ko tod kar naa laaen
 Teasing vegetation at night is not considered good
 nahin hogi paison kii killat, buudhvaar ko karen ganpati kii- bhagwaan vishnu, shrikrishna, satyanarayan ji kii puja main tulsi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 tulsi ke bina inaki puja purna nahin maani jaati he
 Therefore, if you want to worship at night, then break the basil leaf during the day
 kaam hote-hote ruk jaataa he to karen ye upaay- surya bhagwaan din ke devtaa hai
 Therefore, if someone is doing special puja during the day, then along with that, Sun God should also be worshiped
 lekin raat ke samay surya dev kii puja naa karen

 It is difficult for a woman to accept equal status or hear 'no' on her behalf, even more so when harassment is introduced in popular entertainment as a natural link to play and play
 main aise maamalon se waakif hum jinamein aadamiyon ko apni mahila saathiyon ke pahanane-odhane ke dhang par tikaa-tippanee karne, unki ijaajat ke bagaiyr unki tasviren khinchne yaa unki nijee jindagi main taakazank karne, unki manshaaon ko galat tehraane or unhen daftar kii gapshap kaa vishay bana dene main kuch bhi galat najar nahin aata
 Offshore office events and meetings remain a favorite playground for sexual harassment
 isamen khilandadpan yaa chuttepan kaa bhi ek put hota he or kai baar mujhe tab gahari sharmindagi mahasoos hui he jab maine aadamiyon ko apane bartaav ko jaij tehraate hue suna he, yah kahkar ki ve nashe main the yaa chaalaak ishaare karke ki yah to aapasi rajamandi se hua tha, kyonki vah aurat cigarette yaa sharaab yaa donon pi rahi thi or aasaani se sulabh or dostana thi
 Mild tampering is accepted as a definite invitation and goes as far as to agree
 aise vakt main jab auraton ko zyada aazaadee hasil he or ve iskaa istemaal bhi kar rahi hai, har us aurat ko galat tehraaya jane lagata he jo apane vikalpon kaa istemaal karnaa chaahati he
 Its unintended consequences are being felt at various workplaces
 koi iskaa muqabla kaise kar saktaa he? aurat ko yah salaah dekar ki vah khud ko badale yaa apana bartaav thik kare? isse to langik nirpekshata kii avadharana hi khatai main pad jaaegi jiske liye ham in tamaam kanoonee rakshaswachon ke jariye kaam karte aa rahe hai
 Strict measures taken by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (prevention, Prohibition and Prevention) Act 2013 are so different from the deep-rooted clutches in our society that mere professionalism of the corporate cannot countenance the spontaneous reactions to stress Condition emerges

 When it comes to the functioning of the POSH (POSH) law, even the organizations that follow it have little idea

 The training of "what to do" and "what not to do" related to behavior and the possible situations that cause harm is particularly important and important
 gambhir nateezon ke bare main saaf-saaf bataaya janaa aise aacharan ko rokane main kargar he
 Many men are particularly nervous about being mistaken and feel that they need to be checked
 meri najar main aisa ek bhi maamla nahin aayaa jisamen nuksaan na pahunchane vaali koi baat yaa haavbhaav kii report kii gai ho
 Women also accept good hugs and laughter-jokes with good style and understanding
 bair ke chalate bhi shikaayatein kii gai hai, par unki bhi waisi hi laanat-malaanat kii jaati he jaisi yon utpeedan kii
 Until our mindset changes, training will be an important part of stopping both of them fearfully
 aakhir main jo baat kargar hoti jaan padati he vah sanghathanon main aa rahi sanjidagi he
 This means that the law is not being followed just like a machine — that is, create an internal complaints committee, give the employee a draft of the SHA while recruiting them or give training once to show that the rules are accepted has gone

 This is exactly what we are doing through the Shee of Shiroz (SHE) —a technology-driven solution to end harassment at the workplace

 Instead, we have to move faster towards creating an inclusive workplace

 Farmers' organizations are strongly opposing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)
 aakhir kisaan is vyapaar samjhaute se itnaa ghabaraae kyon hai? iske do kaaran hai
 The first is the past experience of farmers engaged in agricultural production and the dairy industry and the second concerns the future
 denmark or newjiland se schimd milk powder (esaimpi) ko jiro aayaat shulk main aayaat karne kii bharat sarkaar kii niti ne bhartiya dudhiyon yaa kahen doodh utpaadan ke dhandhe main lage logon kii qamar tod di thi
 One such agreement was signed with Sri Lanka over tea leaves
 ise bhi jiro aayaat shulk main bharat sarkaar ne aayaat karnaa shuru kiya tha
 Between 2000-2004, the effect of tea leaf imports from Sri Lanka was that domestic tea leaves were priced at a quarter
 pichley anubhav bataate hai ki videshi doodh or krishi utpaada bharat main aane se gharelu utpaadon kii keemten ghatengi
 Some farmers openly and some tacitly accept that domestic products will not stand up to global products in terms of quality
 kisaanon kaa yah dar darasal krishi kshetra ko vaishvik pratispardhaa ke liye taiyaar karne main asafal rahi ab tak kii sarkaron kii pole bhi kholta he
 When the Government of India had to increase the import Shukalsal in 2012, the Government of India had to face the anger of the farmers for zero import duty on skimmed milk powder
 deshbhar ke kisaan ekajute hokar sadakon par aa gaye the
 Actually, skimmed milk powder (SMP) was being imported from Denmark
 desh main companiyaan bhartiya dugdh association se doodh lekar powder banane kii jagah is aaayaatit doodh ke powder ko kharid rahi thim
 Milk powder was mixed with water and liquid milk was made and these were being sold at cheap prices
 sarkaar ke is kadam se bhartiya dugdh association ko baari nuksaan hua
 This resulted in people engaged in milk production
 aakhirkar sarkaar ko aayaat shulk badhanaa padaa
 The same happened in the case of import duty of skimmed milk powder and butter oil from New Zealand and Australia
 vaishvik pratispardhaa main aane se kyon ghabaraate hai kisaan?dinadayal upaadhyaay maarg main sthit endi tiwari bhawan main kisaan netaaon ne ek or shankaa jaahir kii
 That is, the facilities provided by Indian farmers, such as subsidies or technical assistance, also do not match with other countries
 yani agar bazaar main videshi krishi utpaada kii bharmaar hogi to log bhartiya krishi utpaadon ko nahin kharidenge
 Farmer leader Biju from Kerala said with an example, there was a trade agreement between Sri Lanka and India on import of tea leaves
 2000-2004 tak jiro aayaat shulk par chaay kii pattee srilanka se aayaat kii gai
 In these four years, the price of domestic tea leaf has come down drastically
 chaay kii hari pattiyon kii keemat 16 ru
 Per kg
 se ghatakar 4 ru
 Per kg
 ho gai
 The biggest problem facing farmers who are already getting lower prices than the production price in India is that the current prices of domestic products will be further reduced with the arrival of foreign products
 krishi utpaada ke daamon ke girane kii shankaa kii vajah kahin gharelu utpaada kii gunvattta main kami kaa hona to nahin? kisaan netaa is baat ko maanate hai ki bhartiya kisaan antarrashtriya kisaanon ke saath pratispardhaa main kahin nahin tikta
 So who is responsible for increasing the quality of domestic products and preparing the farmers for international competition? Actually, the governments till now thought only of increasing agricultural production
 inaki khapat or gunvattta ke bare main kisi sarkaar ne ab tak nahin sochaa?sarkari faisle ke virodh main kisaan phir band karenge gaanv!kisaan sanghathan kshetreey vyapak aarthik bhagidaari (aarasieepi, riginal comprihensive iconomic partnership) kaa virodh jataane ke liye ab sadakon par aaenge
 On October 18, farmers will start this protest with 'gandhigiri' by submitting a memorandum to the district collectors in the name of the PM
 matlab na naare or virodh pradarshan ke liye ekajute honge
 They will express their grief by simply tying a black band in their hands
 lekin sarkaar agar nahin maani to kisaan 2 november ko kuch ghante ke liye road or hive jam karenge
 And even then if the government does not agree then once again the farmers will 'close the village'
 isse pehle pichley saal june ko das din ke liye kisaanon ne mandsaur main pradarshan ke dauraan sarkari goli khaakar shahid hue kisaanon kii yaad main gaanv band kiya tha
 However, in June this year, the farmers did not organize any such event
 gaanv band ke dauraan kisaan, doodh, fal or subjiyan deyari, achhatiyon ko nahin bechenge
 Consequently, these agricultural products will not reach the cities and will create difficulties for the people
 lekin punjab se aae raav gajender singh kehete hai, tabhi to log kisaanon ke saath judenge jab unhen pataa chalegaa ki kisaan agar apana kaam band kar denge to kisaan hi nahin duusare log bhi baari mushkil main aa jaaenge
 But the problem is, will the government come under this pressure? Currently, Chinese President Jinping is visiting India on 11 October
 is dauraan china ke saath aaarasiipi par muhar lag sakati he
 Not only this, in Thailand, this issue can be finalized in Thailand along with six other countries including ASEAN countries
 aise main kisaanon kaa shrinkhalabaddh virodh pradarshan kitna asardaayak hoga yah to vakt batayega
 Meanwhile, on October 10, farmers burnt the effigy of Union Railway and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal with the banner of Reject RCEP in their hands

 mahila ke pati ne uski baanh kaa andruni hissaa yah kehete hue kaat diya tha ki 'tum isi ke kaabil ho'
 But when the woman tried to run away, her husband hit her leg so hard that her toe was uprooted
 daily mail ke mutabik maamla britain kaa he
 At present, the hearing of this case is going on in Cambridge Crown Court
 peedit mahila ne yah bhayaavah aapbeetee apane smartphone par record kii thi taaki vah sabit kar sake ki uske pati ne uske saath kya-kya nahin kiya
 a shocking footage presented in the court showed the accused standing on top of the woman with folded hands
 iske baad screen par andhera chaa jaataa hai kyonki mahila apana phone chipa leti he
 Later the cry is heard
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ko bataaya gaya ki peedit mahila ne kul 17 recordings banaai hai
 The woman's husband used to slap her and slam her head in the wall so that the neighbors would also hear voices
 kanoonee vajah se mahila kaa naam saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya he
 The woman was married in an Asian country
 usne pehali baar apane pati ko shaadi ke maukey par hi dekha tha
 They later emigrated to the UK and both settled in Cambridge
 mahila kaa kahana he ki uskaa pati use ghar se baahar jaakar kaam nahin karne detaa tha
 He was not even allowed to step outside the house while away from work
 mahila kaa kahana he, 'uske gharavaale mujhe moti kaha karte the or mujhe baahar walk par bhi nahin jane dete the

 AJSU se alag hone ke baad bijepi ke liye chunautinuksaan paatane ke liye bijepi ko kerani hogi mehnatsudesh mahato kii party kaa rajya main acha janadharabhartiya raajnneeti kaa ye nayaa daur he jahaan lagbhag har tarah kii sthapit dharanaen tut rahi hai
 Here not only the scenario of national politics has changed but state level politics is also going on a new pattern
 kuch saal pehle tak bijepi zyaadaatar rajyon main sattadhari dalon ko mukhya rup se chunauti detii thi, lekin ab wo in rajyon main mukhya party ban gai he
 In these states, the BJP is also facing a new challenge and allies are giving this challenge to them
 jab maharashtra main shivasena ne bijepi kaa saath chhod diya to iske jatke jharkhand main bhi mahasoos kiye gaye
 Just before the election, the All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU), a BJP ally in Jharkhand, severed ties with him
 19 saal pehle jab bihar se alag hokar jharkhand kaa nirmaan hua to do chijen yahaan kii raajnneeti main behad ahm raheen
 First, so far no party has got a majority on its own
 doosraa, nivartmaan mukhyamantri raghuvar das rajya ke ek maatr aise siem hai jinhone apana kaarykaal puraa kiya he
 The BJP achieved a majority figure in 2014 with the support of AJSU
 aise main ab jab ki jharkhand main bijepi-ajasu kaa gathbandhan tut chukaa he, to 'abaki baar-65 paar' kaa naaraa dene vaali bhartiya janata party kii raajnneeti par iskaa kitna asar hoga, ye bhi kaaphi ahm he
 The country vs state election: The BJP has set a target of 65 in the Assembly based on its performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 is chunaav main bijepi-ajsu ne rajya main 14 main 12 siten jiti thim or 56 pratishat vot hasil kiye the
 In this election only BJP got 52 percent votes
 agar loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-ajasu ke is pradarshan ko vidhansabha siton ke hisaab se dekhen to nishkarsh nikalataa he ki bijepi or ajasu 63 vidhansabha siton par aage he jabaki congress, jeemem, jeviem or argedy 18 siton par jeet hasil kar sakati he
 The BJP has suffered a loss of votes in the recently held Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections
 haryana main bijepi ko 22 pratishat voton kii haani hui he, jabaki maharashtra main use 9 fisad voton kaa nuksaan hua he
 If we look at the results of the last three assembly elections, we find that out of 81 seats in Jharkhand, 26 are seats where AJSU has been getting votes
 haalanki, yah vot share bahut zyada prabhavi nahin he
 These 26 seats are such that in the last three elections, Azu has received more than 5 percent votes on average
 2009 main AJSU 40 siton par chunaav ladi or 5 fisadi vot hasil kiye, lekin sudesh mahato kii ye party 5 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In the 26 seats we have discussed above, Azu's vote share in 2009 was 14 percent and this party won 5 seats
 ye ilaake zyaadaatar chotanagpur kshetra ke adivasee ilaake hai
 These include Singhbhum, Ranchi, Ramgarh, Palamu, Bokaro districts
 ye ilaake naksal prabhavit bhi rahe hai
 BJP has been a bit weak in this area
 2009 main is ilaake main bijepi ko sirf 17 fisadi vot mili, lekin ajasu se gathbandhan kii vajah se uskaa vot share badhkar 23 pratishat ho gaya
 The vote share of AJSU and BJP together stood at 35 per cent
 nayaa paridrishyjharkhand main jeemem, congress or argedy ne gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 All these parties contested separately in the last election
 is baar agar AJSU apana vot bank barkaraar rakhane main kaamyaab rahati he to bijepi ko isse nuksaan ho saktaa he
 This time due to the break-up of the alliance with AJSU, the difference of votes between BJP and jmm-congress will be just 14 percent and due to this, BJP may lose some seats
 rajyon main vistaar, bijepi kii nai ranneetirashtriya str par prabhutv badhaane ke baad bijepi kii yojana rajyon main party ko majboot karne kii he
 This is why the BJP is not giving more seats to its ally AJSU in Jharkhand
 agar jone-2 kii baat karen (55 siten) to is ilaake main bijepi kii pakad majboot he
 Even if the other parties maintain the 2014 performance, the BJP will remain 8 percent ahead of the combined votes of Congress and JMM
 haalanki, haal ke chunaav ke nattejey dikhaate hai ki bijepi loksabhaa ke ellection main jitani majboot thi utani majboot vidhansabha ke chunaav main nahin rahi he
 Jharkhand is a state where 28% of the population is tribal, and JMM, JVM and AJSU have a significant dominance over tribal votes
 aise halaat main ek aise saajheedaar kaa bijepi dwaara saath chhodana jiskaa in voton par acchhee pakad he bijepi ke liye hanikaarak sabit ho saktaa he

 aarushi hatyakand main hai court ne talwaar danpati ko bari karte hue sibiai kii jaanch par kai sawaal uthaae hai
 While Justice BK Narayan and AK Mishra spoke about tampering of evidence and production of fake witnesses, it also pointed to the dress scene of the crime scene and many other things like that
 hai court ne ek gavaah bharti mandal par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Bharathi Dr
 talwaar ke yahaan kaam karti thi
 She said in the trial court that after the incident she reached Rajesh Talwar's house at around 6 am
 us samay darwaja khul nahin paaya tha
 After which the CBI had said that on the basis of Bharti's statement it is estimated that the door was closed from inside on the night of the murder
 haalanki, jab bharti se dobaaraa bayaan liye gaye to usne kaha ki jaisaa use sikhaaya gaya tha, aisa hi usne apane bayaan main kaha
 Now the court bench has said that it is clear from both the testimony of Bharti that it was prepared before testifying
 court ne ek farji gavaah pesh karne kii bhi baat kahi he
 In fact, Sanjay Chauhan had said in his testimony that when he took a walk in the morning, he saw police vehicles at Dr
 Talwar's house
 andar farsh or railing par khun laga hua tha
 In the case of this witness, the defense questioned the CBI how they came to know about Sanjay
 kyunki sanjay ne trial court main gavaahi ke dauraan saaf kaha tha ki ghatnasthal par usne police se koi baat nahin kii thi
 It is clear from this that Sanjay was a fake witness made by CBI
 sibiai ne kaha tha ki rajesh talwaar kii golf stick se aarushi or hemraj ke sir par hamalaa kiya gaya
 The throat of the two was then cut with a surgical blade
 lekin bench ne kaha ki record main is baat kaa saboot he ki jo golf stick rajesh talwaar ne di thi, na to use thik se sil kiya gaya or na hi malkhane main rakhaa gaya
 He was also molested
 is maamle main court ne ek baat par dhyaan dilaayaa ki 2008 main sibiai ne ek sound test kiya tha
 Actually, Rajesh and Nupur had said that because of the sound of AC running, they do not hear any action happening outside their room
 test main bhi yah baat sahi sabit hui lekin trial court main yah baat nahin bataai gai
 During the trial of this case, the defense said that Hemraj's blood stained pillow was found in the room of compounder Krishna
 sibiai ne krishna samet rajkumaar or vijay ko poochtacha ke liye hiraasat main liya tha
 But he was later released
 karrwai ke dauraan bachaav paksh ne kaha tha ki yah saaf he ki katl kii raat krishna or hemraj ek saath the
 Apart from this, other people were present in the house except Rajesh and Nupur
 haalanki, sibiai ne jo dastavej pesh kiye hai, unamem kaha gaya ki takiya or uskaa cover hemraj ke room se baraamad hua tha
 This was accompanied by a "typographical mistake" in the CDFD, Hyderabad report, which was clear in the CBI report that "there is no possibility of any mistake" in the evidence
 lekin court ke samaksh pesh kiye gaye sabooton main antar tha
 The court ordered SP r of CDFD

 The trial court had noted that the mortuary of Maidheemraj was found on the roof of the house
 chat ke daravaaje bhi us samay band the
 The roof door was never locked before the incident and Talwar did not give the police the key to the lock
 iske saath hi kaha gaya tha ki koi bahari shaks na to shav ko upar le ja saktaa he or naa hi krime seen ko dress ap kar saktaa he
 However, the High Court denied Hemraj's body concealment
 is maamle main pehle kaha gaya tha ki talwaar danpati ne hemraj kii hatya kar uske shav ko chat par chupaaya tha
 So that later he can be set up
 lekin bench ke mutabik, hatya ke baad jaanch main noida police kii laaparvaahee ke chalate hemraj ke shav ko nahin dhundha gaya
 The prosecution had stated that the flat was washed away soon after Aarushi's murder
 haalanki, hai court ne is maamle main saaf kaha he ki noida police or sibiai ke paas is baat kaa koi saboot nahin mila he

 darasal, manyata he ki bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa janm bhadrapada yani ki bhado maah kii krishna paksh kii ashtami ko rohinee nakshatra main hua tha
 If we look at the date of Ashtami, then Janmashtami should be on 23 August, but if we consider Rohini Nakshatra, then Krishna Janmashtami should be on 24 August
 aapako bataa den ki kuch logon ke liye ashtami tithi kaa mahatv sabase zyada he vahiin kuch log rohinee nakshatra hone par hi janmashtami kaa parv manaate hai
 Put Krishna on Janmashtami day, this one thing will not be enjoyed, the need to create 56 bhog will make this affair happen, when Krishna said to Duryodhana - 'I have come to bind, what has the chain brought big?' Janmashtami 2019: Janmashtami When is it? On 23 or 24 August, know that Kansa stood up to kill his brother-in-law Vasudeva on hearing the speech here
 tab devaki ne usase vinayapurvak kaha- 'mere garbh se jo santan hogi, use main tumhaare saamne laa duungi
 What is the benefit of killing a brother-in-law? ' Kansa agreed to Devaki and returned to Mathura
 usne vasudev or devaki ko karagrih main daal diya
 Seven children were born from Devaki's womb in the dungeon itself but Kansa killed them as soon as they were born
 ab aathvaan baccha hone vaala tha
 They were vigorously guarded in prison
 usee samay nand kii patni yashoda ko bhi baccha hone vaala tha
 At the time when a son was born to vasudev-devaki, at the same time a girl was born from Yashoda's womb, which was nothing but 'maya'
 jis kothri main devaki-vasudev kaid the, usamen achaanak prakaash hua or unke saamne shankh, chakra, gada, padam dhaaran kiye chaturbhuj bhagwaan prakat hue
 Both fell at the feet of God
 tab bhagwaan ne unase kaha- 'ab main punah navjaat shishu kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa hum
 You send me to your friend Nanda's house in Vrindavan at this time, and hand over the girl who is born to him to Kansa
 is samay vaataavaran anukool nahin he
 Still you don't worry jaagate hue paharedaar so jaaenge, karagrih ke phatak apane aap khul jaaenge or ufanti athaah yamuna tumko paar jane kaa maarg de degi
 At the same time Vasudev, leaving a newborn baby-form Sri Krishna in the soup, left the prison and crossed the Yamuna, and reached the house of Nanda
 vahaan unhone navjaat shishu ko yashoda ke saath sula diya or kanya ko lekar mathura aa gaye
 The prison gates closed as before
 tabhi kansa ne bandigrih jaakar devaki ke haath se navjaat kanya ko chhinakar prithvi par patake dena chaha, lekin vah kanya akaash main ud gai or vahaan se kaha- 'are murkh, mujhe maarane se kya hoga? tuje maaranevaala to vrundavan main ja pahunchaa he
 He will soon punish you for your sins
 meraa naam vaishnavi he or main usee jagadguru vishnu kii maaya hum
 She became angry after saying so
 apane mrityu kii baat se ghabaraakar kansa ne putana ko bulaakar use krishna ko maarane kaa aadesh diya
 Pootna assumed the form of a very beautiful woman after getting Kansa's orders and reached Nanda Baba's house
 usne mauka dekhakar krishna ko uthaa liya or apana doodh pilaane lagi
 While breastfeeding, Krishna also lost his life
 putana ke mrityu kii khabar sunne ke baad kansa or bhi chintit ho gaya
 This time he sent a horse monster named Keshi to kill Krishna
 krishna ne uske upar chadhakar use yamalok pahunchaa diya
 Kansa then sent a monster named Arishta as the bull
 krishna apane bal rup main kreedaa kar rahe the
 While playing, he broke the seagulls of that monster in a moment and killed it
 phir daanav kansa ne kaal naamak daitya ko kauwe ke rup main bheja
 As he approaches Krishna to kill him
 shrikrishna ne kauwe ko pakadakar uske gale ko dabochakar masal diya or uske pankhons ko apane haathon se ukhaad diya jisase kaal naamak asur maaraa gaya
 One day Shri Krishna was playing on the banks of river Yamuna, when the ball fell from him and he jumped into the river to get the ball
 idhar, yashoda ko jaise hi khabar mili vah bhaagti hui yamuna nadi ke tat par pahunchi or vilaap karne lagi
 When Shri Krishna reached down, Nagaraja's wife said- 'oh gentleman! From which place and for what purpose have you come here? If my husband Nagraj Kalia wakes up, he will devour you
 ' tab krishna ne kaha, 'main kaaliya naag kaa kaal hum or use maar kar is yamuna nadi ko pavitra karne ke liye yahaan aayaa hum
 As soon as he heard this, Kalia Nag got up from sleep and started fighting with Shri Krishna
 jab kaaliya naag puri tarah maranasann ho gaya tabhi uski patni vahaan par ai or apane pati ke praanon kii raksha ke liye krishna kii stuti karne lagi, 'he bhagwan! main aap bhubaneshwar krishna ko nahin pahchaan pai
 Hey Janaad! i am devoid of mantras, devoid of actions and devoid of devotion
 meri raksha karnaa
 Hey, God! Hey Hare! Give me my lord in the form of prasadam, that is, protect my husband
 ' tab shri krishna ne kaha ki tum apane puure bandhu-baandhvon ke saath is yamuna nadi ko chhod kar kahin or chale jaao
 After this, Kalia Nag bowed down to Krishna and left the Yamuna river and went elsewhere
 krishna bhi apni gend lekar yamuna nadi se baahar aa gaye
 Here, when Kansa did not think of any solution, he called Akrur and said that go to Nandgaon and bring Krishna and Balarama to Mathura
 mathura aane par kansa ke pahalwaan chaanur or mushtik ke saath mall yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii
 At the entrance of the arena, Kansa left an elephant named Kuvalaya so that he could crush Krishna
 lekin shrikrishna ne us hathi ko bhi maar daalaa
 After that, Sri Krishna stuck his foot in Chanur's neck and killed him in the battle and Baldev killed Mushtik
 iske baad kansa ke bhai keshi ko bhi keshav ne maar daalaa
 Baldev killed the demons from the pestle and plow and Krishna from the Sudarshan Chakra on the Saptami of the Shukla Paksha of the month of Magha
 shri krishna ne kaha- 'he dusht kansa! utho, main isi sthal par tumhen markar is prithvi ko tumhaare bhaar se mukt karuunga
 Saying this, Krishna grabbed Kansa's hair and twisted it and hit the earth, killing him
 kansa ke marane par devataaon ne akaash se krishna or baldev par pushp kii varsha kii
 Then Krishna freed Mata Devaki and Vasudev from the prison and handed over the throne of Mathura to Ugrasena
 
 bolo shrikrishna bhagwaan kii jai

 But after the alliance is broken, it will depend on the election results

 - AIR inpur ke saath The 13-year-old tradition of singing Vande Mataram has broken this time on the first date of the month at the Madhya Pradesh (MP Government) Secretariat
 nae saal ke pehle kaary diwas ek janvari ko mantralay main ‘vande maataram' nahin gaaya gaya
 Now a new controversy has started about this
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) sachivalay main maheene ke pehle kaarydiwas par vande maataram na gaae jane ko lekar satta main baithi congress party kaa kade shabdon main aalochana kar rahi he
 Former Chief Minister of the state Shivraj Singh Chauhan has also given his response
 unhone twit kar kaha ki congress yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati hai jaati hai lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the song of Vande Mataram should always be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 congress shaayad yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati he, jaati he lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the anthem of Vande Mataram be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan as always before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 ek anya twit main shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki agar kagress ko raashtra geet ke shabd nahin aate hai yaa phir raashtra geet ke gayan main shame aati he, to mujhe bataa den! har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vallabh bhawan ke praangan main janata ke saath vand maataram main gaaungaa
 If the Congress does not know the words of the national anthem or is ashamed to sing the national anthem, then let me know! On the first date of every month, i will sing Vande Mataram with the public in the premises of Vallabh Bhavan
 jai hind!vahiin, bhaajapa kii madhya pradesh ikai ke pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne twitor par likhaa ki vande maataram kaa aayojan saamaanya prashasan vibhaag dwaara kiya jaataa tha, jo ki (mukhyamantri) kamalnath ji ke paas hai
 Is it closed by his order? He has recently said that he would not care for criticism of a work
 agarwal ne aage likhaa ki ab kya (madhya pradesh main) ‘bharat mata kii jai' bolne par bhi roak to nahin hogi? madhya pradesh ke saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ke apper mukhya sachiv prabhanshu camel se is par pratikriya lene kii koshish safal nahin ho saki
 At the same time, Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta did not give much weight to the incident, saying that Chief Minister Kamal Nath is not in Bhopal today and Sudhi Ranjan Mohanty has taken over as the Chief Secretary of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, maybe its Walking Vande Mataram is not sung today
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa is baat kaa batangad kyon bana rahi he? yadi yah aaj nahin gaaya gaya he, to yah kal yaa baad main gaaya jayega
 Do not look at it from a wrong perspective
 (input bhashaa se) Shahid Siddiqui, who was expelled from Samajwadi Party after interviewing Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, has announced to stay away from party politics, saying that he has been made a scapegoat for the vote bank by the party
 siddiqui ne baatcheet main kaha ‘maine ek patrkaar ke taur par modi kaa saakshaatkaar kiya
 My motive was not to benefit Modi in any way
 maine to 2002 ke dangon ke baad kii sthiti bataane kii koshish kii he jise log bhul chuke the
 The Samajwadi Party has decided to throw me out only because of vote bank politics
 ’unhone do took shabdon main kaha, ‘sach kahuun to modi kii aad main mujhe bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya he
 'siddiqui said' He (SP) has a thief in his heart
 vah pehle kalyaan singh ko shaamil karte hai, sakshi maharaj ko shaamil karte hai or phir iske liye maafee maangate hai
 i have always fought for secularism and will fight
 samaajawaadee party kaa yah faisla behad afsosna he or patrakarita par hamalaa he
 Only familyism is going on in this party
 ’haal hi main apane urdu saptahik ‘nayi duniya’ ke liye siddiqui ne modi kaa saakshaatkaar kiya tha jisamen modi ne varsh 2002 ke dangon ke liye maafee maangane se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki agar vah (modi) doshi paae jaaen to unhen faansee par chadha diya jaae
 Asked why he interviewed Modi at the moment, Siddiqui said, "A lot of people are asking questions that are completely meaningless
" ek patrkaar ke rup main modi kaa saakshaatkaar karne kaa mauka mila or maine kiya
 i asked Modi the question that nobody could have asked
 ’unhone kaha, ‘modi kaa saakshaatkaar karne kaa meraa koi doosraa makasad nahin tha
 When asked about the next political move, Siddiqui said, "I will stay away from party politics now, but my writing, reading and speaking will continue
" sabhi partiyon main bolne or likhane kii aazaadee par bandish he, aise main main dalgat raajnneeti nahin kar saktaa
 So there is no question of joining any party

 Just one year after he resigned as the Chief Minister of Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal will once again take oath as the Chief Minister of Delhi at the Ramlila Maidan on 14 February
 dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii shandaar jeet ke baad 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne kaha, arvind kejariwal 14 farvari ko ramlila maidan main dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 Kejriwal won the New Delhi seat by defeating bjp's Nupur Sharma by a huge margin of 31,583 votes
 varsh 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ek nai party ke taur par ubhari 'aap' ne congress ko tisare sthaan par dhakelkar ek harahungez karnama anjaam diya tha
 At that time, BJP had emerged as the largest party
 kejariwal ne dilli ke saatven mukhyamantri ke rup main 28 disambar ko aitihaasik ramlila maidan main saarvajanik rup se shapath lee thi
 This is the same Ramlila Maidan, which became the venue of the Lokpal movement
 kejariwal ne 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main dilli kii teen baar kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko unke hi garh main 25,864 voton ke baari antar se haraaya tha
 Kejriwal resigned on February 14 last year after 49 days in power, when the anti-corruption Janlokpal Bill was obstructed by the BJP and Congress

 pahari rajya himachal pradesh 50 karod dollar (2,750 karod ru
 ) Is on the verge of losing a ski valley project
 vajahah rajya sarkaar kaa iske liye spasht soch nahin bana paanaa
 The Himalayan Ski Valley (HSV) project was approved by the then Congress Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh in 2004 but was canceled by the BJP government in January 2010
 paryaton ke lihaaj se ise sarvaadhik pratyaksh videshi nivesh vaali pariyojna mana gaya tha
 The Himachal High Court has slammed the Prem Kumar Dhumal government over this change in policy
 justise ravi sharma ne 22 june ke apane aadesh main kaha, " shashan ek satat prakriya he
 There should be consistency in the decisions taken by the state government in policy matters
 "maamla janvari, 2004 kaa he, jab ford motors ke sansthaapak henry ford ke padpote alfred ford ne virbhadra singh se milakar kullu ghati main ek ski resort kaa prastaav rakhaa
 American hotel developer and HSV managing director John Sims says, "this was Davos's answer to India
 isse 3,500 logon ko rojgaar mil saktaa tha
 "the Virbhadra government gave him permission and in December 2005, an mou (mou) was also signed between the state government and HSV
 teen maheene baad rajya sarkaar ne vistrut pariyojna report ko bhi manjuuri de di
 Sims and his team also started work for a ski resort project to be built on a 100-acre plot
 iske liye upyukt logon kii khoj shuru hui or 60 sthaneey logon ko ski prashikshak ke rup main training ke liye finland bheja gaya
 The promoters paved the way for Shapoorjipalonji, the flagship company of the construction business and entered the world of luxury group Six Senses Resorts & Spas, entrusting the responsibility to it
 lekin 2007 main sarkaar ke badal jane ke saath pariyojna ke prati sarkaar kii niti bhi badal gai
 In 2008, the Dhumal government constituted a committee to review the project
 jisane pariyojna ko radd karne kii sifarish kii or 7 janvari, 2010 ko bijepi sarkaar ne ise radd kar diya
 Sims says, "first they (BJP government) took two years to look carefully at our plans, then we started spending money, and now they say, sorry, we were joking
" majaak to main nahin samaj paaya, main khud majaak banakar jarur rah gaya hum"
 Interestingly, the recommendations of the committee convinced Dhumal, but the court rejected them
 adaalat ne tippanee kii, "yah sabit ho chukaa he ki pradesh sarkaar pehle hi pariyojna ko radd karne kaa man bana chuki thi or cameti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par notice bhejnaa mahaj rasm adaayagi thi
 The notice issued to the company on 7 January 2010 is outside the jurisdiction of the government and the scope of the law
 "hycourt ke is faisle ke fouran baad dhumal ne supreme court se apil karne kaa elaan kar diya
 He said, "the government was not against the project
 hamane pariyojna sthal par ek jansunwaayee yojit kii thi
 Local people and non-governmental organizations objected to the project as they feel that it is not only environmentally bad, but it will also pollute the land
 " pariyojna kaa virodh karne waalon kaa yah bhi daawa tha ki devtaa uske khilaaf hai
 This had a tremendous effect in hurting local sentiments against the project
 ek anya aapatti yah thi ki puri pariyojna hi sthaneey bhoomi ko hadapney kii ek "chatur chaal" thi
 But annoyed by these arguments, Sims says, “we were providing 3,500 jobs on 100 acres of land
 main jameen kyon hadapna chaahunga? main vahaan koi nausainik adda nahin shuru karne ja rahaa tha
 That land is three times more expensive than Colorado land
 "ve kehete hai, "adaalat pradesh sarkaar ke har bahaane ko khaarij kar chuki he
 “although the court has given permission to work on the project but the promoters of HSV are unable to decide whether 8 years and Rs 100 crore
 kharch ho jane ke baad kaam ko jari rakhaa jaae yaa nahin
 Sims and Company term this behavior of the government as 'unstable behavior' and they are apprehensive as to what will be the attitude of the government after the assembly elections in the state in November
 yah is baat kaa ek or namoona he ki bharat videshi niveshkon ko kis tarah bhramit karne vaale sandesh de rahaa he

 Salman and Jacqueline will also be in the lead role this time in the film, but Garri was stuck in the name of the director for many days
 khabar aa rahi thi ki celebrity diarector rohit shetty salmaan khan starer is film kaa nirdesan kar sakate hai
 However, this news could not be confirmed
 rohit ke alaava bhi kai naamon ke saamne aane ke baad ab is baat kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa ho gai he ki film kik-2 kaa nirdesan pehle part kaa diarection kar chuke sajid nadiadwala hi karenge
 Nadiadwala Grandson tweeted from his verified Twitter handle, “cooling the rumors
 ham kisi or nirdeshak kaa naam kik-2 ke saath jode jane kii kisi bhi khabar kaa khandan karte hai
 The next part of the franchise is going to be with Kick-2 Nadiadwala Grandson
 iskaa nirdesan sajid nadiadwala karenge
 The announcement of who will be the villain this time in Salman Khan's Kick-2 has not been announced yet
 Clearing the air, we strongly deny any reports of association of any other name as the director of Kick 2
 The next of the franchise, Kick 2 is with Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment & will be directed by Sajid Nadiadwala
 — Nadiadwala Grandson (@ngemovies)june 10, 2019pichley part main navazuddin siddiki ko villen kaa kirdaar diya gaya tha or kahani ke climex main salmaan navaj ke kirdaar ko maar daalate hai
 Because it is being said that the story of the second part of the film will be started from where the story of the first part of the film was finished, so the chances of Nawazuddin Siddiqui coming back as a villain are very unlikely

 On Wednesday, during an event on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of 'operation Blue Star', a clash was witnessed inside the Golden Temple complex
 parisar main log talwaar laharaate or laathiyaan bhaanjte najar aae
 The struggle took place between the hardline Sikh elements (pro-khalistan) and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in front of the Akal Takht

 The SPGC tried to prevent radical elements from disrupting the program, during which one man was injured

 These radical elements were raising slogans in support of Khalistan and anti-india

 During the clash, an eyewitness present there said, 'during the struggle, a turban was thrown on the ground

 On the first day of Sharadiya Navratri, Chief Minister Mayawati may have registered three more districts in the geography of Uttar Pradesh through three rallies, but earlier on more than two dozen occasions she had drawn the boundaries of new districts in the geography of the state, In them, the wheel of development did not turn as fast as was expected then
 2007 main satta sanbhaalane ke ek saal baad mayawati ne eta jile se ek hisse ko alag kar basapa sansthaapak ke naam par kanshiram nagar banaaya to laga ki nayaa jila vikaas ke tamaam ayaamon ko peeche chhod degaa

 The district administration also has a tota of 40 per cent of the employees

 Kasganj Community Health Center has been converted into a district hospital, but not enough buildings have been built for it so far
 yahaan na sirf chikitsakon kii kami he balki sabhi jaruri swasthya suvidhaayen bhi mukammal taur par maujuud nahin hai
 Ambedkar Nagar district, which was carved out of Faizabad after Bhimrao Ambedkar, is the oldest in the list of districts in the state that Mayawati had formed during her previous tenure
 mayawati ab tak jitne jilon kaa gathan kar chuki hai, unamem ambedkar nagar main hi sabase zyada vikaas hua he
 But even after 16 years have passed, all the imperfections related to the basic systems remain here
 colectrate, vikaas bhawan, jila aspataal main karmchaariyon kii khaasi kami he
 Due to absence of district jail, prisoners have to be taken from Faizabad to Ambedkar Nagar Court

 Even after more than three years of formation of the baghpat-khekra-barot Development Authority, 60 percent of the staff is available here
 yahi vajah he ki praadhikaran puri kshamta ke saath kaam nahin kar paa rahaa
 In the name of urbanization, the authority is still taking action only to approve the map

 In fact, in 2005, the then chairman of the Revenue Council, Brijesh Kumar submitted an assessment report to the state government, according to which at least Rs 500 crore was provided for providing minimum basic facilities in a newly formed district
 kii jarurat hoti he
 But according to a senior council official, "the way construction costs have increased today, it is now worth at least Rs 800 crore to build basic facilities in the new district
" kharch honge
 Ambika Chaudhary, who was the revenue minister in the SP government, says, "after creating new districts many times, providing the necessary facilities there increases the problems of the public

 Says Sinha, "government buildings could not start in time due to problems in land acquisition in many districts
 ab adhigrahan se judi baadhaon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 "actually, the formation of new districts and most important after naming them after the Dalit greats, Mayawati tried to send a message to her mass base that the honor of the Dalits is safe in the BSP itself
" rajnatik vishleshak surendra singh bataate hai, ''dalit mahapurushon ke naam par nae jile banaakar mayawati ne apane janaadhar se party kaa judaav majboot kiya
 The party benefited from this not in a limited scope but in the assembly elections as a whole
 ''mujffarnagar se shamali ko alag kar jila prabudgh nagar, gajiabad se hapur ko alag kar panchasheel nagar or muradabad se sanbhal or badaayun se gunnaur ko alag kar bhimnagar jila banane ke peeche bhi mayawati kii ranneeti virodhiyon ke garh main basapa kaa janaadhar majboot karne kii he
 By announcing three new districts, he has openly challenged Ajit Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav with strengthening their Dalit vote bank
 shamali main ajit singh to sanbhal main mulaayam singh kaa prabhaav rahaa he
 However, there is nothing inappropriate in creating new districts in view of the large size of the state, but this work should not be done to advance its political ambitions but for administrative and public convenience, only then the formation of new districts can be proved to be helpful

 Born in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, Khwaja has no relation with the mysterious Sufism, but this Khabbu, playing only the second Test against India, did not look at any bowler, nor did he jump with heroic gestures

 And when these three barely played 50 balls (exactly 51) against Khwaja's 213 balls, the result was clear
 khwaja usee kad ke khilaadi hai, jaise ki rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana, arvind disilva, endi flower mohammad yusuf
 
 
 These players do not attract any glamor from outside
 inke liye inkaa balla, inkaa khel or cricket kaa maidan hi khwaja he
 They seek their kick somewhere within themselves

 yahaan tak ki unke kiye kaa credit bhi captain le jaae, team le jaae, koi bhi le jaae, ve kisi sufi kii tarah jaise yahi gaate rahenge ‘tu hi tu, tu hi tu’
 Players like Khwaja and Pujara are always able to remain the same as they are, they refuse to be anything more than that

 There are always some seats in the Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha that express the mood of the people
 pashchimi upi kii mujffarnagar or devband vidhansabha siten muslim siyasat kaa garh maani jaati hai
 The SP had unilateral support of Muslims in the 2012 assembly elections
 tab devband main rajendra rana or mujffarnagar main chitaranjan swaroop ne baari jeet darj kar sapa kaa paracham laharaa diya tha
 To thank the Muslims, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav gave these two leaders the chair of the minister
 lekin chaar varsh main halaat kaise badal gaye hai, ye vidhansabha siten uskaa saaf mujahiraa kar rahi hai
 The untimely deaths of Rana and Swaroop led to the by-elections in Deoband and Muzaffarnagar assembly seats in February
 sapa ne janata kii sahanubhuti ko 'cash' karaane ke liye rana kii patni minaa rana ko devband se or swaroop ke bete gaurav swaroop ko mujffarnagar se chunaav maidan main utaara
 But on 16 February, when the results of the by-elections came, the picture looked somewhat changed
 sapa ye donon vidhansabha siten dobaaraa nahin jeet saki
 This defeat revealed that the sp's grip on Muslims has been loosened
 2017 ke chunaav se pehle musalmaan bahul siton par mili haar ne mulaayam singh yadav kii chunauti ko or badha diya
 This challenge is being met on many fronts as well
 bispi ne sapa samarthak musalmaan vot bank main send lagane ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor laga diya he
 The All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslemine (AIMIM) national president and MP Asaduddin Owaisi's election knock in UP has also raised the ears of the SP
 in badale halaat main mulaayam singh ke saamne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ke liye musalmaan voton par chunaav jitau sameekaran taiyaar kar paane kii badi chunauti aa khadi hui he
 Shortly after the by-elections in Muslim-dominated seats, Mulayam Singh started the exercise of declaring SP candidates for the lost seats in the 2012 elections
 25 march ko mulaayam ke chote bhai or cabinet mantri shivpal singh yadav ne 142 ummidavaaron kii suchi jari kar vidhansabha chunaav kii jang kaa aagaaj kar diya
 Mulayam Singh has played his well-known bet by placing the maximum number of 28 Muslim candidates in this list
 akhilesh-mulaayam jugalbandi2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main vipakshi partiyon kii kaat ke liye mulaayam kuch vaisaa hi taana-bana bun rahe hai, jaisaa bijepi netaa amit shah or narendra modi kii jodi ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main buna tha

 ve apane bhaashanon main musalamaanon yaa kisi anya jati kaa alag se koi ullekh nahin karte
 Recently, two dozen youths were given tickets in the Zilla Panchayat President and MLC elections, in which there was not a single Muslim
 vahiin duusari ore sapa sarkaar ke chaar varsh puure hone ke maukey par jari kitaab main bhi sirf akhilesh yadav kii vikaas yojanaon kaa bakhaan kiya gaya he
 Muslims are mentioned only in the schemes of the Minorities Department
 vahiin duusari ore mulaayam singh yadav sapa ke kor vot bank musalmaan or yadav par puraa dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 Despite this, this jugalbandi has not been able to get the required work from the authorities
 22 march ko azamgarh main ek raily main mulaayam kaa yah dard ubhar hi aayaa
 He said, "akhilesh is the Chief Minister, so he wins cricket matches with IAS officers
" jabaki unhen adhikariyon par lagaam lagaakar kaam karana chahie
 There are some officials who ignore my words and go to ask the Chief Minister
 ''pashchim par fokadgale vidhansabha chunaav main pichhlaa pradarshan dohraane kii aas main sapa ne danga peedit pashchim upi par focus kiya he
 This strategy of the party is clearly visible in the list of SP candidates declared on the losing seats
 party ne bijanour kii chaar haari hui saamaanya siton par musalmaan ummidavaar utaare hai
 Similarly, Muslim candidates have been bet on three seats in Bulandshahr
 sapa ne apni pehali suchi main kul 28 musalmaan ummidavaaron ko jagah di he
 18 of them are from western U
P
 meerut college ke arthshaastra vibhaag main associat professor dow
 Manoj Sivach says, "bsp's activism in western UP after the Lok Sabha elections has disenchanted Muslim voters from the SP
" vidhansabha upachunaav ke nattejey isaki tasdik karte hai
 The SP, which was unable to change the attitude of Muslims, is now under damage control
 ''mulaayam apane awaas par muslim dharmaguruon or netaaon ke saath baithken kar rahe hai
 "mulayam is surrounded by some Muslim leaders who have no support base in their area," says a teacher associated with Darul Uloom Deoband, on condition of anonymity
 yahi kaaran he ki musalamaanon kii asal samasyaayein un tak nahin pahunch paa rahi hai
 Apart from this, the resentment of the Muslims of the west is also about the failure of the sp's promises like making Deoband a district, setting up of Haj House here
 musalmaan dharmaguruon kii naaraazgi bhi chunavi saal main sapa par baari pad sakati he
 To get the support of the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the SP has nominated his son-in-law and Legislative Council member Omar Ali Khan for a better ticket
 udhar shiya dharmaguru kalbe jawaad kii lakhanu main 28 march ko ovaisi se hui mulaakaat ne bhi sapa virdohi muslim siyasat ko hawa de di he
 Failed to sense the mood, the SP could not detect the mood of Muslim-majority seats in western Uttar Pradesh in the February by-election
 sthaneey praadhikari nirvachan kshetra se vidhaan parishad sadsy (emelsi) kii khaali 36 siton ke chunaav main sapa ke garh purvi upi se aae nattejey utsahvardhak sanket nahin de rahe
 The SP may have captured 30 seats in the election results of March 6, but the defeat in gorakhpur-maharajganj, varanasi-chandauli, Ghazipur and Jaunpur seats that comprise the districts of Khanty Purvanchal dissolved in color
 is
 jonpur main sapa ke saat emele hai
 Parasnath Yadav, who claims to be close to Mulayam Singh, is a cabinet minister
 lekin sapa is jile main parasnath yadav ke khilaaf bane maahaul ko bhaanp na saki or khamiaja haar ke rup main chukaana padaa
 Even after losing the by-elections to Muslim-majority seats in the West, the SP MLC could not learn a lesson in the elections
 musalmaan matadaataaon ke lihaaj se samvedansheel mujffarnagar-saharanpur emelsi seat par sapa mukaable main kahin dikhaai hi nahin padi
 To calm growing dissatisfaction, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced to launch several big plans for Purvanchal for the first time in the budget presented on 12 February
 isamen 1,500 karod ru
 There is a Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway to be constructed from it, along with plans have been prepared for the University like Ballia, Engineering College at Mirzapur, Medical College at Chandauli
 em-tii-vaai sameekaran2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne svarnim pradarshan karte hue bahumat hasil kiya tha

 sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko spasht rup se kaha ki madhyahn bhojan yojana se labhanvit hone vaale vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhaar card na hone kii sthiti main is suvidha se vanchit nahin kiya jayega or yah sunishchit kiya jayega ki sabhi labhaarthiyon ko madhyahn bhojan ke saath-saath 12 ankon vaali vishisht pahchaan sankhya bhi mil sake
 This assurance was given by HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar during Zero Hour
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi labhaarthi aadhaar card ke abhaav main madhyaahan bhojan kii suvidha se vanchit nahin hoga
 All beneficiaries will get this facility and students who do not have an Aadhaar card will be provided this
 jaavdekar ne yah aashwaasan congress ke motilal vora dwaara madhyahn bhojan yojana ke laabh ke liye aadhaar card ko anivaary banane sambandhi mudda uthaae jane par diya
 Vora had said that the government has made Aadhaar mandatory for the mid-day meal scheme, which suggests that the government does not want to provide mid-day meals to the students
 vora ne kaha ki madhyahn bhojan yojana isliye shuru kii gai thi ki adhik se adhik sankhya main vidhyaarthee padhane ke liye skool aaen
 About 12 crore students are getting benefited under this scheme
 pehle rajg ne aadhaar kaa virodh kiya tha lekin ab usne madhyahn bhojan yojana ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary bana diya he
 Javadekar dismissed this charge outright and said that all the beneficiaries would get midday meal
 ‘‘main is sadan ko bataanaa chahta hum ki koi bhi vidhyaarthee madhyahn bhojan yojana se vanchit nahin rah paaegaa
 Everyone will get the benefit of this and children who do not have an Aadhaar card will be provided an Aadhaar card
 ’’ tippaniyan The HRD Minister said that many beneficiaries of the mid-day meal scheme have Aadhaar cards and those beneficiaries who do not have this card will be provided with a 12-digit unique identification number
 unhone spasht kaha ki jahaan aadhaar ke liye suvidha nahin ho sakati vahaan rajya sarkarein vidhyaarthiyon ko vishisht number muhaiyaa karaayengi
 Javadekar said that there has been a decrease in misuse of the scheme by linking the Aadhar card with the mid-day Meal Scheme
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that no beneficiary will be deprived of the facility of midday meal in the absence of Aadhaar card
 sabhi labhaarthiyon ko yah suvidha milegi or jin vidhyaarthiyon ke paas aadhaar card nahin he unhen yah muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 Javadekar gave this assurance after Motilal Vora of Congress raised the issue of making Aadhaar card mandatory for the benefit of the mid-day meal scheme
 vora ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne madhyahn bhojan yojana ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary bana diya he jisase lagata he ki sarkaar vidhyaarthiyon ko madhyahn bhojan kii suvidha nahin dena chaahati
 Vora said that the mid-day meal scheme was started so that more and more students come to school to study
 is yojana ke tahat kareeb 12 karod vidhyaarthee labhanvit ho rahe hai
 Earlier the NDA opposed Aadhaar but now it has made Aadhaar mandatory for the mid-day meal scheme
 jaavdekar ne is aarope ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki sabhi labhaarthiyon ko madhyaahan bhojan milegaa
 "I want to tell this house that no student will be deprived of the mid-day meal scheme
" sabhi ko iskaa laabh milegaa or jin bacchon ke paas aadhaar card nahin he, unhen aadhaar card muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 '' Comments maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne kaha ki madhyahn bhojan yojana ke kai labhaarthiyon ke paas aadhaar card hai or jin labhaarthiyon ke paas yah card nahin he unhen 12 ankon vaali vishisht pahchaan sankhya muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 He clearly stated that where there is no facility for Aadhaar, the state governments will provide specific numbers to the students

 The decision to bowl first after winning the toss and sending Ravinder Jadeja to Yuvraj Singh at number four has not gone down well with the cricket pundits
 mahaan spinner irapalli prasanna ne kaha ki jadeja kii tulana main to harbhajan singh bhi chauthe number ke liye acha vikalp ho sakate the
 He should not have chosen bowling instead of bowling
 He said that in such an important match, Dhoni should not have chosen to bowl after winning the toss

 It was also a mistake to choose Ravinder Jadeja's Pragyan Ojha
 harbhajan singh bhi sarvshereshth farm main nahin the
 He also said that sending Jadeja before Yuvraj was also a mistake as he had not played in the tournament yet
 ham yuvaraj par bhi jarurat se zyada nirbhar the
