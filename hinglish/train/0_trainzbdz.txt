 is prasang main manu ko lohe se, to may ko lakdi, twashta ko kaanse evam tambe, shilpi eent or daivagya ko sone-chaandi se joda jaataa he
 The prevailing legend on Vishwakarma is a legend establishing the importance of Lord Vishwakarma
 iske anusaar varanasi main dharmik vyavhaar se chalane vaala ek rathkaar apni patni ke saath rahata tha
 He was skilled in his work, but even after trying in different places, he could not get more money from food
 pati kii tarah patni bhi putr na hone ke kaaran chintit rahati thi
 They used to go to the saints and saints to get a son, but this wish could not be fulfilled
 tab ek padosi brahman ne rathkaar kii patni se kaha ki tum bhagwaan vishwakarma kii sharan main jaao, tumhaari ichha puri hogi or amavasya tithi ko vrath kar bhagwaan vishwakarma mahatmaya ko suno
 After this, Rathkar and his wife worshiped Lord Vishwakarma on Amavasya, which brought him wealth and son Ratna and he lived a happy life

 Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court has rejected Chidambaram's plea to surrender before the ED
 chidambaram ne 5 sitambar ko court main ED kii saamne sarender karne kii yachika daayar kii thi
 Responding to the court notice on Thursday, the ED refused to take Chidambaram into custody
 pi chidambaram INX media maamle main sibiai cese main 19 sitambar tak nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail main band hai
 Let us tell you that the petition was surrendered on Thursday in front of the ED of Congress leader and former Union Minister p Chidambaram in Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court
 ienex media bhrashtachar maamle main gat 5 sitambar ko rouz avenue court ne pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ko notice jari kar jawaab daakhil karne ke liye kaha tha
 The court reserved its decision in this case
 court main aaj idi ne chidambaram kii sarender yachika kaa virodh kiya tha
 On behalf of Chidambaram, his lawyer Kapil Sibal asked why the ED reached to arrest him on August 20 and 21 when the ED did not want to arrest Chidambaram
 On behalf of the Enforcement Directorate, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that ED is examining many documents
 chah logon ko bulaakar poochtacha kii ja chuki he
 Inquiries from three people are still going on
 unhone kaha ki chidambaram ko giraftaar karne se pehle ham apni puri taiyaari kar lenaa chaahate hai
 At the moment we do not want to arrest them
 ham baad main chidambaram kii giraftaar karenge taaki ham puri taiyaari ke saath unase poochtacha kar saken
 Mehta said that the 15 days of our custody will start only when we finish questioning six people
 ab poochtacha main do din bhi lag sakate hai, chaar din bhi lag sakate hai
 We have been questioning since September 6
 unhone kaha ki chidambaram abhi nyaayik hiraasat main hai isliye sabooton se koi chhedchhad nahin kar sakate
 Chidambaram cannot even influence the witnesses, so we are interrogating the witnesses
 unke nyaayik hiraasat main rahete hue hi ham zyaada se zyaada poochtacha kar sakate hai
 Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal said that the ED was very keen at first to arrest Chidambaram
 idi to chidambaram ko giraftaar karne 21 agast ko unke ghar bhi gai thi
 On the 20th too, he came outside Chidambaram's house with a notice
 idi ne supreme court or hai court donon main hi kaha ki vah chidambaram ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karnaa chahta he
 Sibal said that he wants Chidambaram to be kept in judicial custody as much as possible
 phir hiraasat main len or phir chidambaram ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhej den
 Now they are making excuses for questioning six people
 ye chidambaram ko taqaliif pahunchane ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 He said that Chidambaram would like to cooperate in the investigation
 ham to kah rahe hai ki aap hamen hiraasat main lijie
 If you did not have to inquire, why did you come to arrest Chidambaram on 20 and 21 August? The accused has the right to surrender in court
 chidambaram ne to court main khud aakar kaha ki main sarender karnaa chahta hum
 The ED said that Chidambaram was in police custody till 5 September
 phir 15 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 We are a separate agency
 ham PMLA ke tahat jaanch kar rahe hai
 In this way, every accused will surrender and ask that the agency take me into custody
 court tay kar saktaa he, unhen 15 din kii hiraasat me bhej saktaa he
 So far we have not filed the charge sheet in this entire case
 court ne is bahes ke baad chidambaram kii sarender karne kii yachika par apana aadesh surakshit kar liya or aaj chidambaram kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya

 Yuvraj Singh's return to the team and the opportunity given to Ajinkya Rahane have revealed his intentions
 bhartiya cricket itihaas ke sabase safal captain mahendra singh dhoni ne achaanak vanade or T20 team kii captaini chhod di he or ab ek khilaadi ke taur par vah team main khelenge
 Apparently, Captain Kohli has kept some special thinking for Dhoni too
 
 
 viraat kohli kehete hai, 'agar main unase poochta hum ki vah kis pojishan par ballebaaji karenge, to jaisaa main dhoni ko jaanata hum
 
 
 He will say anywhere i can, as you say
 pichley kuch saalon se dhoni jis pojishan par ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 
 
 i want to see him bat above that so that he can enjoy cricket to the fullest
 agar apane shuruaati dinon kii tarah dhoni apane khel kaa puraa majaa lete hai to team india ek majboot unit ban jaaegi
 ' dhoni ne 2004 main bangladesh ke khilaaf apana pehla vanade match khelaa

 In the Mohali ODI against New Zealand last year, Dhoni batted at number 4 to lead Team India to victory
 haalanki ranchi vanade main bhi vah isi number par aae lekin apana jaadu nahin dikhaa sake
 Now the question is which batting position is right for the former captain? Looking at the record, Dhoni has scored 98 runs in 2 innings while opening
 isamen 1 ardhshtak shaamil he vahiin number 8 kii 3 pariyon main dhoni ke khate main 51 ran hai
 He has scored the most runs at number three, fourth and fifth

 Now the pressure of captaincy is not on them, in such a situation, they can play freely
 28 saal ke viraat ne bhi apane pehle captain ke liye team main sateek role talash kar kai sawaalon ke jawaab de die hai
 'dhoni's ability, understanding about cricket, understanding of cricket environment is special in itself

 According to Goddess Bhagwat and Tantra Chudamani, the right thigh of Sati fell here
 navaratri ke dauraan yahaan kaaphi bheed umadti he
 Prominent among the 51 Shakti Peeths of Sati, three worshiped statues of Goddess are enshrined in this place of worship

 The city protector of Patna is Bhagwati Patneshwari, also known as Chhoti Patan Devi

 ’ mahasaptami ko mahanisha puja, ashtami ko mahagauri or navami ko siddhidatri devi ke pujan ke baad havan or kumari pujan main badi bheed jutati he
 On Dashmi Tithi, Aparajita Pujan, Shastra Pujan and Shanti Pujan are performed

 It is believed that there were 51 blocks of Sati's body during Mahadev's Tandava

 Sati's right thigh fell here
 gulzaar baag ilaake main sthit badi patan devi mandir parisar main kaale pathar kii bani mahakali, mahalakshmi or mahasaraswati kii pratimaa sthapit hai
 Apart from this, there is a statue of Bhairav here

 The idols of this temple are said to be of the Satyuga

 The government is trying to ban election surveys before the upcoming elections
 is koshish ke teen pahalu hai: kaalpanik, vyaavhaarik or kanoonee
 Though the Election Commission and political parties are hardly able to agree on any issue, but on this issue there is unity
 ek ore to opinian pols kii vishwasaneeyata or tareeke par sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 On the other hand, they talk about influencing voters
 aarope yah he ki ve sambhavit vijetaon kii ore bhedchaal maansikta ko badhaava dete hai
 This is a strange contradiction
 agar janamat surveykshanon kii prakriya main hi khot he to ve votaron ke ruzan ko kaise prabhavit kar paa rahe hai
 Common sense and logic say that both cannot be together
 agar janamat surveykshan votaron ko sambhavit vijetaon kii ore jane ko prerit karte hai to ve kai baar galat kaise ho jate hai? yahi nahin, alag-alag janamat surveykshan vipareet bhavishyavaaniyan kaise karte hai? hairat kii baat yah he ki janamat surveykshanon par pratibandh ke pakshadharon (jisamen sarkaar ke varisht vakil or chunaav ayog ke kuch adhikari shaamil hai) ke paas iske liye koi thos aankade nahin hai
 His arguments can be called as much bias as possible
 is masale par samajashastriyon ke paas jo thode-bahut aankade uplabdh hai, unase to yahi pataa chalata he ki voter janamat surveykshan ke sambhavit vijetaon kii ore khinche nahin chale jate hai
 Even if there is such a "sheepish" effect, it can be argued that his "opposite current" can balance it
 ek pal ko maan lijie ki ye atakalein sahi hai
 Nevertheless, forgive me for questioning how these surveys become illegitimate or illegal? The basis of democracy is to choose based on information 
 log vibhinn sroton se praapt jaankariyon ke aadhaar par apane faisle lene ke liye aaazaad hai
 If they are free to get news from TV, newspaper, internet and views from political analysts, then they definitely have the right to get information from public opinion polls too
 kisi reporter ke liye mahaj 10 logon se baat karke kisi khaas kshetra main chunavi rujhaanon kaa andaja lagaana kaise jaij ho jaataa he
 But how is it wrong to take opinion poll knowing the opinion of 1,500 people? Of course, it can be argued that the demand for ban on opinion polls is an attack on freedom of expression as provided in Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution
 yah kahana betuka he ki janamat surveykshan avaigyanik or avishwasaneey hai
 If the opinion polls are truly unreliable, then why has the Central Government maintained the largest survey agency, the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO)? The organization, established in 1950, currently operates under the Ministry of Statistics and is the largest organization of socio-economic surveys in the country
 isi ke aankadon par sarkaar kii anginat nitiyaan or kaarykram chalate hai
 Ironically, the Election Commission, which is so convinced of the ban on public opinion polls, has conducted a nationwide public opinion poll to find out "information, trends, behavior and attitude of voters"
 india today ne hi desh main 1984 ke aam chunaavon main janamat surveykshan kii bade paimaane par shuruyaat kii
 After that around 125 elections have been held in the country for the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies
 inamen janamat surveykshanon ke sateek baithne kii dar kareeb 95 fisadi rahi he
 People engaged in this profession have been able to live up to their credibility and this credibility has been made almost by accurate estimates based on their surveys
 is profeshan main bhala koi bhi apni saakh se samjhauta kaise kar saktaa he?vibhinn muddon par janata kii raay jaanane ke liye surveykshan koi nai baat nahin hai
 For the first time in the general elections of 1957 in his country, the Indian Institute of Public Opinion under the leadership of Eric de Costa conducted a poll
 unhen bharat main surveykshanon kii shuruyaat karne vaala mana jaataa he
 a decade ago, when the Election Commission demanded a ban on opinion polls, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government rejected it
 2004 main janamat surveykshanon par roak kaa virodh karte hue tatkaaleen atorni general soli psorabji ne kaha tha ki pabandi kii aisi har koshish asanvaidhanik hogi
 He said recently, "such arguments are given only because of doubt on the intelligence of the average citizen in understanding various public opinion and post poll surveys

 Nobody came to know

 Should not the money be withdrawn if given in error? There were six to seven months between the two installments

 supreme court ke faisle ke anusaar ayodhya (ayodhya)main masjid nirmaan ke liye paanch acre zamin lene yaa nahin lene ke maamle par uttar pradesh sunni central vakf board (sunni Waqf Board) kanoonee raay le rahaa he or uskaa kahana he ki vah ravivaar ko lakhanu main ho rahi ol india muslim personal lau board kii baithak main is silsile main liye jane vaale nirnay ko 'khaas' ahmiyat degaa
 Board President Zufar Farooqui said on Friday that the Sunni Waqf Board would attach special importance to the decision of the Muslim Personal Law Board on the issue of whether or not to take land in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki muslim personal lau board ayodhya maamle main koi pakshakaar nahin tha, magar vah beshak desh main musalamaanon kii sarvamaanya sanstha he, lihaaja uske nirnay ko ahmiyat dena vaazib he
 Farooqui said that the question at the moment is whether the Sunni Waqf Board can refuse to take five acres of land to be given on the order of the Supreme Court for the construction of the mosque, and it would be contempt of court to do so, for this Has started taking legal opinion
 unhone ek sawaal par kaha ki zamin lene ko lekar logon kii alag-alag raay he or us zamin par koi rachanaatmak kaam kar puri duniya ko sandesh dene kii manshaa rakhane vaale logon kii taadaad bahut kam he

 Meanwhile, Senior Advocate Zafaryab Jilani, convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, said that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had led the Muslim side in the Ayodhya case, so its decision on whether to take the land for the mosque construction was the most
 Should be given more priority
 is sawaal par ki agar zamin lene ke maamle par sunni vakf board or muslim personal lau board kii raay alag-alag hui, to us surat main kya hoga, jilani ne kaha ki sunni vakf board ayodhya maamle main akelaa pakshakaar nahin tha, balki use muslim paksh kaa numaayinda maan liya gaya tha, lihaaza is silsile main sunni board akele koi faisla nahin le saktaa
 The Supreme Court, while ruling in the Ayodhya case on November 9, ordered the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site and the Muslim side to provide five acres of land in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board for construction of a mosque
 sunni vakf board is maamle main musalamaanon kii taraf se mukhya pakshakaar tha
 Farooqui, the chairman of the Sunni Waqf Board, had said on the matter of acquiring land for the construction of the mosque that negativity can be eradicated only through positivity
 musalamaanon ke sabase bade saamaajik sanghathan jamiyat ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh moulana arshad madani kaa kahana he ki musalamaanon ko babari masjid ke badale di jane vaali zamin nahin leni chahie

 However, the great terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who has done great black exploits in the world of terrorism, will never let his identity disappear

 kya koi murda bhi kabhi jinda ho saktaa he? dilli main ek ilaake ke log isi sawaal par pareshaan hai
 The reason behind this is that a person is murdered here first
 police laash baraamad karti he, or phir gharavaale uski pahchaan kar lete hai
 Hundreds of people in the locality mourn the sight of the corpse and, after all, the ashes are immersed and cremated until the thirteenth
 lekin thik 27 roj baad, wo shaks phir se ghar laut aata he
 Biwi is surprised to see his husband in front of his eyes
 dar ke maare behosh ho rahi he
 Seeing his father coming near, the children are running away
 apane bete ko saamne paa kar maa foot-foot kar rone lagi he
 And the younger brother cannot believe his eyes
 par sawaal ye he ki aakhir dharam singh ke saath aisa kya he? kyon use dekh kar koi dur bhaag rahaa he, koi ro rahaa he, koi behosh ho rahaa he or koi apni ankhon par yakeen nahin kar paa rahaa? aakhir kyon dharam singh sabake bich hote hue bhi ek chhalaava ban chukaa he? aapke saare sawaalon kaa jawaab ye he ki dharam singh mar chukaa he
 Yes, you read it right, it's dead
 lekin iske baavjood wo naa sirf sabaki ankhon ke saamne bilkul sahi-salaamat khadaa he
 Rather, he is talking like any other person and is also surprised by this environment around him
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki bhala aisa kaise mumkin he? jo shaks mar chukaa ho
 The family whose body has been cremated with their own hands
 or to or, terahavin ke baad tamaam reeti-rivaaj ke saath log jisaki asthiyaan tak gashganga main pravaahit kar chuke hon
 How can the same person stand up well before everyone's eyes? After all, how can he be alive? to janaab, yahi wo paheli he
 Which has badly confused not only the family members of Dharam Singh but also the hundreds of people living in Badli area of delhi
 balki ab to haalat ye he ki dharam singh jidhar se guzar jaataa he, kamjor dilavaale gharon main dubak jate hai
 Women faint
 logon ko bukhaar chadh jaataa he
 The matter is not very old, only 27 days ago, when people saw Dharam Singh dead
 police ne baqayada uski laash baraamad kii thi
 Along with the people of the street, his family members also identified the corpse
 dharam singh ke kapadon ke saath-saath jism par maujuud kai khaas nishaan uski laash par jas ke tas the
 That is, everyone was satisfied that his son Dharam Singh was the one who died
 lekin in sabake thik 27 rose baad dharam singh achaanak apane ghar aa pahunchaa
 Whoever saw him passing through the street, just kept looking
 use bhoot samaj kar kisi ke paseene chhot gaye
 Tokoi will scream out of fear
 gairon kii baat chhodie, apane bete ko jinda dekh kar khud gharavaalon kaa bhi bura haal hua
 But the question is, what is this puzzle? What is this story of a dead human being suddenly alive? And if this person is Dharam Singh, then who is the family whose body was cremated? So the more complicated this story of a corpse being alive, the more shocking the reality behind it
 wo koi aam maut nahin mara, balki usesaikadon logon ke bichchori ke ilzaam main peet-peet kar maar daalaa gaya
 And then when the turn came to identify the corpse, the family members saw that just like Dharam Singh, one of the corpses of the corpse is broken, one finger is severed
 yani dharam singh kii maut ko lekar har koi mutmain tha
 But in the meantime the story turns around
 ek murda ke jinda hone kii ye kahani kii ravivaar 23 agast 2015 ko shuru hui
 Late night in Badli area of delhi, some people suddenly caught sight of some thieves roaming the area
 log fouran gharon se nikle or choron kii gherebandi shuru kar di gai
 The others escaped when they got a sound, but a thief climbed into the crowd
 bas phir kya tha? logon ne is shaks kii itani pitayee kii ki maukey par hi uski maut ho gai
 Now in the morning, the police was also on the scene
 police ne maranevaale kii pahchaan pataa karne kii koshish kii
 And soon he came to know that this man, almost 30 years old, is Dharam Singh, who lives in a nearby street, who is a truck driver, but was probably roaming this day with the intention of theft
 ab police ne laash baraamad karpostmortem ke liye bhijwa di, saath hi dharm singh ke gharavaalon ko shinaakht ke liye bulaayaa
 On seeing the dead body, the people started crying in broad roar, according to them it was Dharam Singh
 usne kapade bhi dharam singh kii tarah pahane the or uske bhi saamne kaa ek daant tutaa hua tha
 And just like Dharam Singh, he too had a finger amputated
 yani umr ek, kapade ek or to or jism main maujuud nishaan bhi ek
 That is to say that there was no scope of doubt in identifying the corpse
 lihaaja, gharavaalon ke shinaakht kar lene ke baad police ne kanoon aupchaariktaaon ke baad laash unke hawaale kar di
 The father and brother had already identified the corpse of Dharam Singh in the hospital
 ghar pahunchane par dharam singh kii bivi bhi apane shuhar kii laash dekh kar behosh gai, or to or maa bhi gash kha kar gir gai
 The children also started crying
 yun kahen ki puure mohalle main matam chaa gaya
 The family members of Dharam Singh spent about Rs
 30 thousand and along with the locals, cremated him at the nearby crematorium
 iske baad vakt gujarata gaya, or jindagi phir se apni raftaar pakadaney lagi
 But this case of Dharam Singh's death stood on his head when, exactly 27 days after his death, on September 18, Dharam Singh suddenly returned to his home
 darasal, dharam singh ko pehali baar kisi ne paas ke bazaar main dekha or phir daudta hua uske bhai gaurav ke paas pahunchaa
 He told that Dharam Singh is alive and walking in the market
 lekin gaurav sametaghar ke duusare tamaam logon kii hairaani kaa tab koi thikaana nahin rahaa, jab dharam singh kuch hi der baad apane ghar aa pahunchaa
 Now the question was, where did Dharam Singh live for so long? And if this is Dharam Singh, then who is the person who died? In this era of mobile phones, when every person is connected to each other round the clock, then what was the secret of this mysterious disappearance of Dharam Singh? After all, when everyone was crying over the death of Dharam Singh, his corpse was being cremated, then where was the real Dharam Singh hiding? People were surprised at the joy of Dharam Singh becoming alive again or rather say that he returned home
 ab har kisi ke jehan main yahi sawaal tha ki agar vahi dharam singh he to aakhir wo itane dinon tak kahaan rahaa? jab puraa ilaaka uski maut ke matam main duba tha
 The family members were identifying his corpse
 mohalle ke logagharavaalon ko santvanaa dene aa rahe the, tab dharam singh kahaan tha? or to or jab uski asthiyaan gashganga main bahaai ja rahi thi, tab wo kahaan tha?aakhir kyon itane dinon tak usne ek baar bhi gharavaalon ko phone kar ye bataane kii koshish nahin kii ki wo jinda he, sahi-salaamat he
 While this phase is of mobile phones, and today there is hardly anyone who does not have mobile
 to dharam singh ke paas aise har sawaal kaa jawaab maujuud tha
 According to Dharam Singh, since he drives a truck, a few days before this incident, he had taken the truck along with goods from Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar nearby and left for delivery
 iske baad wo assam bhi gaya, bihar bhi or jharkhand bhi
 And thus through many states and many cities, he returned to Delhi again on 18 September
 dharam singh ne apni baton ke haq main tamaam rajyon ke naakon or alag-alag jagahon par uske or trek kii entry ke kaagaj hone kii bhi daleel di
 However, when Dharam Singh himself was recognizing all the people of the house and the people of the house, Dharam Singh, there was no need for such argument and his evidence
 baharhaal, dharam singh ke jinda hone kii baat ab beshak saaf ho chuki ho, lekin itane dinon tak uske gaayab rahane kaa ravaiya ab bhi sawaalon ke ghere main tha
 Dharam Singh would have already called his family members
 to shaayad uske jeene-marane kii ye kahani itani lambii nahin hoti
 But why didn't Dharam Singh do this? Actually, he was angry with the quarrel with his family over his habit of drinking alcohol
 iske peeche vajah he dharam singh ke pine-pilaane kii aadat kii
 According to Dharam Singh himself, he is very fond of drinking alcohol
 or isi vajah se uski apane gharavaalon se aksar anban hua karti he
 And for this reason, this time when he went to his work with a truck, he did not try to talk to his family or call them again for so many days
 lekin yahaan pahunch kar jab use apni maut or is par gharavaalon ke is matampursi kaa pataa chalaa, to use is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki uske sharaab pine kii lat khud us par uske puure parivaar par kitni baari padi
 However, the return of Dharam Singh has now raised a new question for the police, who was that person who was killed by beating the public in the middle of the night? kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) main chal rahe vivaad main alok verma ko to sibiai nideshak pad se hataa diya gaya he
 Apart from this, in another case, Delhi High Court will give its verdict on the petition of Rakesh Asthana, Special Director (sent on leave) of CBI today

 Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the country was divided on the basis of religion because of the Congress
 agar congress aisa na karti to aaj aatankwaad kaa mudda hi na hota or na hi pakistan adhikrut kashmir hamase alag hota
 Shah said that Congress should not teach us history
 unhone kaha ki tab 600 se adhik rajavaade the lekin tab grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne har riyasat ko hindustan main shaamil karavaaya
 He said that the princely states of Hyderabad and Junagadh were refusing to come to India, but the issue was with Sardar Patel, so there was no problem

 Just after Amit Shah said this, the Congress mps started creating a ruckus and started opposing Amit Shah
 duusari ore amit shah ne bhi palatwaar kiya
 He said why should we not take his name, when the whole country is suffering due to his mistake today
 is bich congress ke lagaataar hangaame ke baad amit shah ne kaha ki chaliye, ham unka naam nahin lete hai
 But Shah first used the word Prime Minister for him and this too caused a ruckus
 bataa den ki amit shah ne shuukravaar ko jammu-kashmir main raashtrapati shashan badhaane kaa prastaav loksabhaa main rakhaa
 But speaking on behalf of the Congress, Manish Tiwari opposed it

 In this fake picture, a placard is placed in the hand of an Indian girl, which has a comment against India

 With the defeat of Team India, again many questions and controversies have started to arise
 ek baar phir captain emes dhoni kii batting posishan ko lekar bhi baaten shuru ho gai hai, lekin purv captain sunil gavaskar in sabake liye 5wein or chathe number ke ballebaaz manish pandeya or kedaar jadhav jaise ballebaazon ko dabaav se upar uthakar khilne par jor daalaa he
 As india-new Zealand ODI series draws to a close, fingers are being raised towards Team India's player, team management and team captain MS Dhoni
 kai jaankaar dhoni ke batting posishan ko lekar bhi dabi jubaan main ishaara kar rahe hai
 But former captain Sunil Gavaskar believes that due to less experienced in the team, the 5th and 6th batsmen are unable to fulfill their responsibility, which the team has to bear
 unke mutabik dhoni or rohit sharma ne bhi pehle kai baar apni kaabiliyatsabit kii he
 The comments purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai, "chathe or saatven number ke ballebaazon ko apni zimmedaari nibhaani chahie
 We are questioning Rohit Sharma and Dhoni
 lekin inhone apni kaabiliyat pehle sabit kii he
 He has also scored in the past
 team management ko manish pandeya or kedaar jadhav ko bharosa dilvaanaa chahie ki wo ran bana saken
 " kuch aisi hi raay purv kiwi captain brendan maikkalam bhi rakhte hai
 They say that if Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni pair batting together, it becomes difficult for the opposition team to set the fielders
 wo maanate hai ki in donon anbhavi khilaadiyon kaa ek saath ballebaazi karnaa kisi bhi vipakshi team ke liye mushkil paidaa kar saktaa he
 Dhoni has come at number four and has shown his mettle in Mohali
 ye or baat he ki wo khud bhi kah chuke hai ki wo pehle kii tarah batting rotate nahin kar paa rahe
 Finding a match finisher for the team is still becoming a big task
 bharat-newzealand vanade series ke barabari par aate hi team india ke khilaadi, team management or team ke captain emes dhoni kii ore ungliyaan uthne lagi hai
 Many experts are also hinting at the murky tongue of Dhoni's batting position
 lekin purv captain sunil gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki team main kam anbhavi hone kii vajah se 5wein or chathe number ke ballebaaz apni zimmedaari nahin nibhaa paa rahe jiskaa kaamiyaaza team ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 According to him, Dhoni and Rohit Sharma have also proved their ability many times before
 tippaniyan Former captain Sunil Gavaskar says, "the number six and seventh batsmen should carry their responsibilities
 ham rohit sharma or dhoni par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 But he has proved his ability first
 inhone pehle bhi ran banaae hai
 Team management should assure Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav that they can score runs
 " Former Kiwi captain Brendon mccallum has a similar opinion
 wo kehete hai ki viraat kohli or emes dhoni kii jodi ek saath ballebaazi kare to vipakshi team ke liye filders set karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 He believes that batting these two experienced players together can make it difficult for any opposition team
 dhoni chauthe number par aakar mohali main apana jalawaa dikhaa chuke hai
 It is another matter that he himself has said that he is not able to rotate the batting as before
 team ke liye ek match finisher ko dhundhna vaaki phir bhi ek bada kaam banataa ja rahaa he

 (deeksha Priyadarshi is an ITMI student and a trainee at India Today) *** ashok gahalot jab se mukhyamantri bane hai, tabhi se sharaab vikritaon par talwaar latak rahi he
 The reason for this is probably that Gehlot does not even touch liquor
 lekin sharaab vikritaon ne mukhyamantri kii nitiyon kaa jaisaa virodh 26 agast ko kiya, vaisaa pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya tha
 They went on a statewide strike
 naaraazgi kii shuruyaat 2009 main hi ho gai thi
 Ashok Gehlot, then chief minister, had announced a ban on the sale of liquor after 8 pm for the first time
 is saal agast main graahakon se zyada paisa vasuulne or raat 8 baje ke baad bhi dukaan khuli rakhane kii shikaayatein sunne ke baad gahalot ne sakht kadam uthaate hue afasaron ko dukaane sil karne or or jarurat padane par license radd karne kaa nirdesh de diya
 Last week, Additional Chief Secretary (finance) of the state Niranjan Arya decided to intensify action against him
 sharaab vikritaon ke khilaaf kareeb 270 chaape maare gaye, un par baari aarthik dand or exiar darj kii gayi
 The raids angered liquor vendors and went on strike on August 26 in six large imfl-sales districts
 unhone 2 sitambar tak rajya sarkaar kii ore se sanchalit vitaran kendron se sharaab kharidne se inkaar kar diya
 15,000 crore approximately
 kaa tex jutaney vaala sharaab udyog rajya main rajasav kaa doosraa sabase bada strot he—lekin isaki vajah se padosi rajyon ke mukaable rajasthan main sharaab kareeb dedh guna mahangi he
 Liquor vendors say sales have fallen sharply
 ve kehete hai ki padosi rajyon se chori se laakar sharaab bechney waalon kii chaandi ho gai he
 The strike may force the government to pay attention to the problems that have been going on since 2005
 2005 main vasundhara sarkaar ne nilaamee vyavastha—jisamen sharaab vikreta sharaab nirmaataaon se sidhe sharaab kharid sakate the—ko badal diya tha
 a lottery-based allocation was started at the site of the auction and the government became the sole seller
 us niti ke tahat prayek license dharak shuddh 20 pratishat kaa laabh le saktaa tha, lekin unhen 10 pratishat se kam laabh par bechney kii manaahi thi
 Muhammad Yunus, a liquor dealer in Jaipur, says, "this has led to a steady increase in the state's revenue
 lekin kuch samay se sarkaar ne atirikt laagat main hissaa bantane ke liye majaboor kar diya he, saath hi aarthik dand or prabhaar bhi laga rahi he jisase hamaara munafa 12 pratishat rah gaya he
 "some vendors admit to charging more than the MRP, but they allege that the government often supplies them with bottles that have old prices written on them
" hadtaal se sarkaar ko ab tak 50 karod ru
