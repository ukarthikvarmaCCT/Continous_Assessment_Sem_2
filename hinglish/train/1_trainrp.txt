 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday and complained to him that the Central Government through the Lt
 Governor was interfering in his work
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, dipti siem manish sisodiya ke saath kendriya grih sachiv kii maujuudagi main rajnath singh se mili or anti karpshan branch main joint seepi kii niyukti or dilli ke grih sachiv ke mudde par apni shikaayat darj karai
 In response, Home Minister Rajnath Singh advised Kejriwal to avoid confrontation and work closely with LG, as LG is the administrative head of Delhi
 rajnath ne ye bhi kaha kii grih mantralay jo niyam banaata he, wo kanoon ke hisaab se hi banaata he or agar kejariwal isse sahamat nahin hai, to court ke faisle kaa intazaar kar len
 Sources reveal that Kejriwal has already met President Pranab Mukherjee and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on this issue and has stated their complaint
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se to kejariwal qi mulaaqaat ek ghante chali thi
 This case is already going on in the court and before the court opens, the Kejriwal government can make a contempt case in the High Court before the regular hearing of the case that when the High Court had told the ACB under the Delhi government, How was the joint CP appointed without asking the Delhi government? Comments sutara bataate hai ki kejariwal abhi is mudde par piem modi se bhi mil sakate hai
 However, Kejriwal has not asked for time to meet PM Modi
 vaise isse pehle kejariwal, piem modi ko chitthee likhakar unki hi sarkaar (modi sarkaar) kii shikaayat kar chuke hai
 By the way, the Kejriwal government has not been able to achieve anything with this letter-letter or complaint-complaint
 centre or dilli sarkaar ke bich takaraav kii sthiti ab bhi bani hui he or aise main bas court hi ekmaatr vikalp nazar aata he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Rajnath Singh in the presence of Union Home Secretary along with Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and lodged a complaint on the issue of appointment of Joint CP in Anti Corruption Branch and Home Secretary of Delhi
 iske jawaab main grih mantri rajnath singh ne kejariwal ko salaah di ki wo takaraav kii sthiti se bachein or alji ke saath milakar kaam karen, kyonki alji hi dilli ke prashasnic pramukh hai
 Rajnath also said that the rules that the Ministry of Home Affairs makes, according to the law, and if Kejriwal does not agree with it, then wait for the court's decision
 sutara bataate hai ki kejariwal is mudde par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee or vitt mantri arun jetali se pehle hi mulaaqaat kar chuke hai or apni shikaayat bataa chuke hai
 Kejriwal had met President Pranab Mukherjee for an hour
 ye maamla court main pehle hi chal rahaa he or court ke khulte hi kejariwal sarkaar is maamle kii niyamit sunwaayee se pehle is baat par hoicourt main adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa cese kar sakati he ki jab hoicourt ne asibi ko dilli sarkaar ke adheen bataaya tha, to dilli sarkaar ko puche bina joint seepi kii niyukti kaise kar di gai?tippaniyan Sources reveal that Kejriwal is yet to meet PM Modi on this issue
 haalanki abhi kejariwal ne piem modi se milane kaa samay nahin maanga he
 Before this, Kejriwal has written a letter to PM Modi and complained about his own government (modi government)
 vaise abhi tak is chitthee-patri yaa shikawa-shikaayat se kejariwal sarkaar ko kuch hasil nahin ho paaya he

 ab ajtak ne doosraa bada khulaasa kiya he ki greater noida ke khanan mafia koun hai or samaajawaadee party ke netaaon kii unase kis tarah kii mileebhagat he
 Know what is the reality of July 14, which became the reason for suspension of IAS Durga Nagpal of Greater Noida
 
 
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa or narendra bhaati kaa kunba baaluu ke karodon rupee ke thekon main sidhe taur par shaamil he
 Durga Shakti had filed a case against a special relative of Narendra Bhati
 isi mukademe kii vajah se baad bhaati parivaar or durga shakti ke bich baaluu ke thekon ko lekar than gai
 It is a matter of July 14, when the auction of sand contracts was going on
 nilaamee greater noida yani gautamabuddha nagar ke jiladhikari ke daftar main ho rahi thi
 SDM Durgashakti was posted in this office
 baaluu ke thekon kii boli lagane ke liye narendra bhaati kaa kunba or samaajawaadee party ke netaa maujuud the
 Omendra Bhati, a special relative of Narendra Bhati, made the biggest bid that day and later retracted
 aman bhaati narendra bhaati ke sage bhai bijendra bhaati kaa betaa he
 Aman Bhati, the real nephew of Narendra Bhati was also present in this contract of sand
 samaajawaadee party kaa jila upaadhyaksh brijpal rathi bhi vahaan tha
 Another leader, Narendra Nagar was also among the bidders for sand
 ajtak ke sting oparation main narendra bhaati ke bhai kailash bhaati ne khulaasa kiya tha ki samaajawaadee party ke tamaam netaaon kii ankhon kii kirakiri ban chuki thi durga shakti
 In fact, on July 14, when big contractors were called for the auction of sand, Bhati's entire family was up
 nilaamee main aisi tikadam bhidai gai, dekhte hi dekhte baaki thekedaar boli se bhaag khadey hue
 Bhati's relatives did a trick
 usne sabase badi 8 karod kii boli lagaai, phir thekedaaron ko bhagaakar boli se mukar gaye
 In this auction, these relatives of Narendra Bhati arrived to plot, not bid
 omendra khaari ne theka lene ke liye 8 karod rupee kii sabase badi boli laga di
 Hearing this huge amount, the other contractors ran away
 baaki thekedaaron ko raste se hataakar khud omendra khaari bhi boli se mukar gaya
 Bhati's clan did the trick to cancel the sand auction, but suspended SDM Durga surrounded the mining mafia in its own net
 bhaati ke rishtedaar omendra khaari par mukadmaa kar diya or iske baad se hi afasar kii eemaandaaree khanan mafia ke ankhon kii kirakiri ban gai
 This most bitter truth of the Akhilesh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh is hidden in the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal

 The Mandi seat is called the seat of Pandit Sukhram and his family
 mandi seat se vartmaan vidhayak anil sharma sukhram ke hi bete hai
 Sukhram represented Mandi seat from 1962 to November 1984
 unke loksabhaa main chune jane ke baad 1985 main didi thakur ne yah seat jiti
 When Pandit Sukhram left the Congress and formed Himachal Vikas Congress, he continued to win the election from this seat
 unke putr anil sharma bhi 2007 se yahan chunaav jeet rahe hai
 Prior to this, Anil had won the 1993 election

 On the other hand, the Congress targeted Arvind Kejriwal and said- 'sheila Dixit used to accuse Kejriwal of failure in the government, but when there are incidents in his own rule, then the Delhi Police should take responsibility for the central government's control by saying Running away from 'nyaayik hiraasat main bheje gaye aaropidelli police ne donon aropiyon ke giraftaar kar court main pesh kiya jahaan se unhen 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 Police are investigating the allegations on both sides
 donon aaropee pehle bhi jail ja chuke hai or philhal jamaanat par reeha hue the
 It was a full month after the Jawaharlal Nehru University's 9 February 2015 program in support of terrorist Afzal Guru and the anti-india slogans there
 is mahinebhar main is ghatana se sambandhit kai chijen hui, jais- bharat virdohi naare lagane ke aarope main kaiyon ko police ne giraftaar kiya
 The accused were beaten by lawyers outside the jail
 jeenyu ke khilaaf or jeenyu bachaao donon ke paksh main jamkar prachaar hua
 After the whole incident, what has become a topic of discussion among the people is the rise of Kanhaiya Kumar, president of JNU Students Union
 kanhaiya hi vah vyakti the, jise police ne ghatana ke baad sabase pehle giraftaar kiya
 Kanhaiyahi was beaten by lawyers outside the court
 kanhaiya hi the, jise media ne 'deshadrohi' kahkar sambodhit kiya
 He remained in jail for 21 days and later came out on bail
 lekin is sabake bich kuch aisa bhi ho rahaa tha, jo kahin naa kahin kanhaiya ke paksh main ja rahaa tha, use lokapriy bana rahaa tha
 Coming out of jail, his speech on the night of March 3 at the JNU campus answered all the questions that had been arising for over a month and the so-called 'traitor' became an instant leader
 55 minute ke bhaashan ne kanhaiya ko raaton-raat hero bana diya
 People agreed with him, started being with him
 kanhaiya prasiddh ho gaya
 But in the midst of all this, it becomes necessary that he also takes care of the challenges ahead and steps ahead by being careful
 in chunautiyon kaa rakhana hoga dhyaan-media par naa ho nirbharkanhaiya ke ubhaar main agar media kaa haath mana jaae, to isse katai bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The speech at the JNU campus was played live on TV
 ye pehla mauka tha, jab kisi chaatr netaa kaa bhaashan is tarah neshnal televijan par chalaa ho or use puure desh ne dekha ho
 But once the media camera is shifted from it, then it will become a challenge how to reach people
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki media kabhi kisi ek par hi nahin ruk kar rah jaataa he
 In a speech coming out of the questions, Kanhaiya attacked the opponents a lot, but the charges on which he went in, spoke very little on that
 abhi tak spasht nahin hai ki 9 farvari ko hui ghatana par kanhaiya kaa rukh kya he
 If they are not in support of him, will he oppose those who organized the event? Now the JNU registrar has claimed that Kanhaiya had expressed displeasure at canceling the approval of the program on the death anniversary of Afzal Guru
 kai sawaal hai, jinke jawaab kanhaiya ke liye kisi chunauti se kam nahin hai
 In his speech in JNU, Kanhaiya attacked PM Modi and RSS only and only in anti-modi politics
 isse bhaashan to hit ho gaya, lekin har baar sirf modi virdohi raajnneeti ghaatak bhi ho sakati he
 Whatever issues he raised in the speech, it is not that only Modi has come up after forming the government
 jeenyu kii saakh lautaanajeenyu main desh virdohi tatv hai, is tarah kii baaten halke or chote rup main kai baar saamne aati thim
 But the incident on 9 February gave rise to such things and openly created an atmosphere against JNU across the country
 jeenyu virodhiyon ko jaise baithe-thaale mudda mil gaya
 In such a situation, it is also the responsibility of Kanhaiya that people's trust towards JNUK should be returned
 ye vishwa prasiddh uniwarsity he, or kisi vyakti vishesh se bahut aage or mahatvapurn he
 Dependent Kanhaiya's growing popularity over the left-wing Kanhaiya may have served as a lifeline for the Left
 unhen kanhaiya main ek ummid najar aane lagi he
 As a result of this, Sitaram Yechury said that he will campaign for us in the Bengal assembly elections
 arse baad kanhaiya ke kaaran left kii vichaardhaara main ek jaan si najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, he will be challenged to survive the ideology of the Left besides his student politics

 In the Congress, Yechury said that if the party differentiates between secular parties, BJP will take advantage of this opportunity
 unki raay ko kai rajyon ke pratinidhiyon se samarthan mila
 The key issue in this was whether the CPI-M should join hands with 'all secular and democratic forces', including the Congress, to compete with the BJP? While the Karat faction is against any alliance with the Congress, the Yechury faction changed the scenario And especially the defeat of the CPI (M) -led Left Front in Tripura and the by-elections in the recent Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 After the victory of the q support shake hands with all the secular parties to counter the BJP

 AAP leaders have become attackers on the ministers of the Modi government due to the news that the central government has not received proposals on the demand of full statehood of Delhi government
 dilli main sattarudh party kaa aarope he ki centre sarkaarpurn rajya kii maangako puraa nahin karne ke liye sansad main jhooth bol rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj says that the Central Government has lied in Parliament because they do not want to tell what is the central government's stand on it if the demand is reached on the full state and by when the Center will decide on it
 kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ne mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main likhit jawaab dete hue bataaya tha kirashtriya rajdhani ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii koi manganhin ai he

 sansad main ek sawaal professor ke ve thomas ne lagaaya tha jisamen grih mantralay se 3 sawaal puche gaye the
 First, is there any demand to make Delhi a full state? If there is another, what is the policy of the Central Government? And how long can the final decision be taken on this? But it is surprising that the Minister of State for Home, who lives in Delhi, reads the daily newspaper of Delhi, saying that no such demand has come

 hit and ran kesamaamle main salmaan khan kevakilshrikant shivade ne court main kai ahm sawaal uthaae hai
 He said, 'why was the fingerprint of Salman Khanka taken in this case when he was not supposed to show it as evidence? When the police knew that there were only three people in the car, then why were the finger prints of steering, wheels and Salman Khan taken? Why were the finger prints sent for forensic examination? And then why was his report not put up with evidence? ' Salman's lawyer said that the forensic report was not in favor of the police case, hence the report was not brought before the court
 is maamle main police ne kii kai khamiyahotel 'je dablue mariat' main vaile parking tag ke gum hone or salmaan khan kii gaadi us raat jis vaile dryver ne park kii thi uskaa bayaan nahin lene kii baat bhisalmaanake vakil ne adaalat main rakhi unhole kaha ki police kii jaanch main shuru se hi kai khamiyaan thi
 When the police recorded the statement of complainant Ravindra Patil while taking an FIR in this case, Ravindra Patil did not say anywhere that Salman had drunk alcohol
 yahi vajah thim kii shuru main druncan driving kii ipisi kii dharaaen cese main nahin lagaai gai thim
 The reference to alcohol came in the supplementary statement of Ravindra Patil and only after that Section 304 (2) was imposed
 sharaab kaa zikr police kii apni dimag kii upaj thi
 There are claims of drinking alcohol, the false liekelman's vehicle also says that the bill of 'rain' bar submitted in the court as evidence is fake
 is cese ke mukhya jaanch adhikari kishan shengal ne usame chhed chhaad kii he
 Eyewitness and injured witness named Mannu Khan have told the court that during the statement recorded under Section 164 of crpc before his magistrate, the police showed his written statement to the magistrate and later signed it
 salmaan ke vakil ne adaalat ko bataaya kii 164 ke tahat aise bayaan lekar magistrate or police ne kanoon kaa makhul banaaya he
 Because the witness has said that he did not know what was written in that statement and he did not know whether it was right or wrong
 gavaah ne ye bhi kaha he kii statement kis bhashaa main likhi gayi thi use nahin maaloom
 The process of taking statements of 164 has not been taken care of for which the culprits should be punished severely
 sarkari paksh ne naa aisa koi saboot pesh kiya na hi kisi gavaah ne sidhe taur par kaha kii salmaan ne vaardaat kii raat sharaab pi rakhi thi
 Investigating officer hid things from the court In the first statement of this case, the investigating officer has said that Salman was not arrested till he left his investigation, whereas Salamangariphtar took place at 11 am on 28th and the first investigating officer left the inquiry on 29th
 phir jaanch adhikari ne yah baat court se kyon chhipaai
 According to Salman's lawyer, he did not want to answer Salman Khan's blood storage and other questions, that's why he said so
 is cese ke mukhya jaanch adhikari ne apane senior afasaron ko khush karne ke liye galat bayaan or saboot taiyaar kiye taaki salmaan khan ke khilaaf 304(2) kii dhara lagaai ja sake
 The doctor gave the false statement: Salman's arrival time in JJ Hospital 25 likhaa gaya he or nikalne kaa vakt 2
 30 is written
 doctor ke bayaan ke mutabik in 5 minute main salmaan kaa beepi bhi check kar liya gaya, respiretary test kiya gaya, khun nikaala gaya or salmaan ko chalaa kar bhi dekh liya gaya
 All these tests are not possible in just 5 minutes
 salmaan ke ye test hue hi nahin the
 The doctor has lied

 Germany's Mesut Ozil will not keep Roza during the World Cup, but many footballers participating in it will fast during the month of Ramadan and will be kept under strict medical supervision
 islamic desh iran or bosnia toornament se baahar ho gai hai, jabaki algeria ne pehali baar antim 16 main pravesh kiya or uske khilaadiyon ko somvaar ko ojil kii germany team ke khilaaf kadi pariksha se guzarana hoga
 Religious organizations in many countries have a pragmatic attitude in football and Ramadan
 2008 main misr kii mukhya islamic sanstha 'daar al iftaa' ne peshewar footballron ko ramajaan ke dauraan khaane kii anumati de di thi, jabaki is maheene main din main khaane kii anumati nahin di jaati
 This Islamic institution said that if players are required to fulfill their contract to play during the month of Ramadan, they feel that they can eat if keeping their fast will affect their performance
 arsenal ke midfilder ojil ne kaha, 'main ramajaan main roje nahin rakh saktaa
 He said that he must have been playing during the World Cup, so this year it will be impossible for me to keep fasting
 ' When the Algerian team clash with Germany in Potre Alegre, most of its players will keep Roja
 isliye team in rojaa rakhane vaale footballron ke liye fifa ke sheersh visheshgyon main se ek khel medicine visheshgy haakim chaalaabi kii sevaayen legi
 Chalabi said, 'this is a time when the risk of injury increases, especially in the lower back, joints and muscles
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah isliye hota he kyonki khilne se sharir main pani kii kami ho jaati he or yah khaane kii kami se nahin hota
 Players can lose up to six liters of water during a match
 ' Another expert said that to recover from exercise during Ramadan, changes in nutritional levels are necessary
 unhone kaha, 'khilaadiyon ko is dauraan pani kii kami nahin hone deni chahie
 We recommend them to have a good meal in the evening and sleep enough

 dilli sarkaar ne bhale hi ek din kaa vidhansabha satr bulaayaa ho lekin isko lekar bijepi ne dilli vidhansabha ke paas jamkar pradarshan kiya
 Activists of the BJP Women's Wing demonstrated under the leadership of BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri
 bijepi ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke gaiyr hajir rahane kaa mudda uthaaya to vahiin mantri sandip kumaar ke sex scandle ke mudde par unase istife kii maang kii
 BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri alleged that government minister and Arvind Kejriwal himself stays out of Delhi
 kejariwal sarkaar dilli ke logon ke kaamkaaj chhodkar punjab or goa main kismat aajamaane chale gaye
 Significantly, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is in Punjab, while Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is also going to campaign for AAP in Goa
 Why was the session called? namaskara main raveesh kumaar
 One day they will have to regret supporting us
 arvind kejariwal ne jab talkhi sakhti or chutki ke saath barkhaa dutt se kaha tha, tab vipaksh ko laga ki anwain kah rahe hai
 So has that day come on which the Congress will regret now or is that day going to come
 kejariwal sarkaar ne shila dikshit ke kilaaf exiaar darj karne ke aadesh dekar gathbandhan ko majboot kar diya yaa janalokapal laane se pehle jhatka diya he
 By the way FIR is always broken by sending an FIR or sent to jail, it is not a fact
 upie tu ke tuji ghotaale main e raja or kanimoi ke jail jane ke baad bhi us samay gathbandhan kii sthirataa par koi fark nahin padaa
 Just as the DMK became tolerant at that time, will the Congress or Sheila Dixit in Delhi be tolerant
 basic kochchan to ye he
 Arvind Kejriwal targeted Sheila Dixit during the assembly elections
 chunaav nazadik aate hi shila ne kahana shuru kar diya ki koi aarope nahin he
 No court has proved corrupt
 shaayad unheen aaropon or tathyon kii talash main kejariwal sarkaar ne jaanch karne kaa faisla kiya he ki rashtramandal khelon ke dauraan dilli kii sadakon par street lite lagane ke liye jis company ko theka diya gaya, use ek baar riject kar dene ke baad kis aadhaar par dobaaraa diya gaya
 It is alleged that by putting seven eight thousand street lights up to 31 thousand, the people of Delhi were allegedly defrauded of 31 crores
 exiaar main mukhyamantri, mantri, peedblyoody or emsidi adhikariyon ke kilaaf jaanch kii baat kahi gai he
 MCD comes under BJP
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya nai sarkaar ko nae saboot mili hai yaa sieji or shungalu cameti kii report hi paryaapt he
 The government today said that the matter was not sent to court and was closed at the level of preliminary inquiry
 to ab file khulegi
 By the way, the application of Space Age, a company to install street lights, was rejected
 chaar paimaanon main kami pai jane ke kaaran use 100 main 48 number mili
 The company appealed directly to the Chief Minister and the Chief Minister allegedly sent the file to the Chief Engineer
 chif ejeeniyar ne unki file waapas usee board ko bhej di jahaan se riject hui thi
 This time the number of that company went from 48 to 67
 shungalu cameti ne ise gambhir mana he
 We have no side of the company
 ek baat or
 Three companies were rejected simultaneously
 un do companiyon ko punarvichaar ke liye apana cese rakhane kaa mauka nahin mila
 So Congress and BJP have come together in this FIR
 raajnneetik rup se
 Now another matter
 5 navbanr 2013 ko lokayukta ne report di ki shila dikshit sarkaar ne raajnneetik phaayde ke liye galat tareeke se aisi coloniyon ko adhikrut karne ke provisional certificket die jo maujuud nahin thim
 The Supreme Court's guidelines were not followed in giving the certificate
 lokayukta ne yah report raashtrapati ko bhej di or raashtrapati ne waapas mukhyamantri kii raay ke liye bhej di
 When Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in on 28 December 2013, he inherited the file
 isi file par unhone likh kar bhej diya ki is par sakht karrwai kii jaani chahie
 The matter of providing basic facilities in the colony, whether it is political or corruption has occurred, will discuss these questions
 lekin bijepi ke dow harshavardhan kaa kahana he ki rashtramandal khelon main street lite to ek sabaject he
 Corruption cases seem to have become like a college college course
 doctor sahab kehete hai ki tissue paper stadium kaa punarnirmaan, pul, dawa, ambulance se lekar kai sabaject hai
 Delhi government is misleading the people of the country
 unhone hamaari maangon par sankethik kadam uthaae hai
 Has the investigation started? vijendra gupta to kah rahe hai ki dilli sarkaar, shila dikshit ko bachaa rahi he
 Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are engaged in stopping BJP
 kanoon mantri ne bhi kaha he ki jaanch main kisi ek vyakti ko target nahin kiya jayega
 But the question is that whenever Arvind Kejriwal takes the initiative of investigation, why does the Congress become so decent
 doosraa sawaal he ki bijepi ko kis baat se yakeen hoga ki kejariwal sarkaar shila dikshit ke kilaaf karrwai kar sakati he
 Did Kejriwal pass the BJP exam after registering an FIR against Sheila Dixit
 congress kya shila ke bachaav main utregi yaa do‚àíchaar bayaan dekar chhod degi
 Has the new government really found such concrete evidence that goes beyond the intention to prove the role of the Chief Minister

 Babul Supriyo is a BJP MP from Asansol in Bengal and Minister of State for Urban Development while Kalyan Banerjee is a TMC MP from Shrirampur and is the Chief Whip of the party in the Lok Sabha
 banerjee ke mutabik, yah ghatana 2 march kii he
 Banerjee has also written this letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on 2 March, in which she has said that Minister Babul Supriyo stopped her within Parliament and asked why she said the wrong thing about him in the House? In her letter, Kalyan Banerjee alleges that Supriyo used abusive language with her
 phir un par apane (supriyo ke) sansadeey kshetra main jaakar galatabayani karne kaa aarope lagaaya or unhen dhamkee di
 Banerjee writes in her letter that TMC MP Aparupa Poddar was present at the time and saw all this happening
 duusari ore kendriya mantri babul supriyo ne banerjee ke aaropon ko galat bataaya he or kaha he ki unhone kabhi kalyaan banerjee ke saath aisa kuch nahin kiya
 According to sources, Banerjee has also complained about this to Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu over phone and said that Supriyo repeatedly gestures him to sit while speaking in the House
 asal main tiemasi or bijepi ke bich pashchim bengal main raajnneetik takaraav tej ho rahaa he

 The Supreme Court has also allowed students who have taken the National Eligibility Interest Test i

 NEET-1 examination to sit in NEET-2 with certain conditions
 somvaar ko justise eaar dave kii adhyakshata vaali bench ne ye aadesh diya
 Rejecting the plea of the states, the Supreme Court did not allow the states to take their own separate examination in this case
 NEET-2 ke aadhaar par hi honge daakhilesupreme court ne apane faisle main kaha,'neet-1kii pariksha de chuke jo chaatr ye samajhate hai ki unhen apni pariksha kshetreey bhashaa kii bajaay angreji main dene ke liye zyada vakt nahin mila or ve sahi se taiyaari nahin kar paae hai, to aise chaatr NEET-2 kii pariksha de sakate hai
 Such students will have to give up the candidature of NEET-1 examination given earlier at the time of their application
 neet-2kii pariksha ke aadhaar par unka chayan ho sakegaa or daakhile liye jaaenge
 The state Supreme Court in its decision will not be able to conduct a separate examination, it has also been said that students who failed to take the NEET-1 examination despite applying, can also take the NEET-2 examination
 haalanki, supreme court ne rajyon ko alag se kshetreey bhashaaon main medical daakhila pravesh parikshaayen yojit karaane kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya he
 It was argued on behalf of the states that they should be allowed to take their examinations
 court ne kaha ki jab centre sarkaar kii ore se pariksha lee ja rahi he, to alag se pariksha karaane koi matlab nahin he
 The court has also made it clear that no private college or association or any private, deemed university will be allowed to take any examination for studying MBBS or BDS

 Petitions filed by many states in the Supreme Court have said that NEET cannot be imposed on them, because their pre-decided exam policy is not just for admission in medical courses, but also for many other courses

 kendriya krishi mantri evam rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke pramukh sharad pavaar ne ravivaar ko yah bayaan dekar vivaad paidaa kar diya ki matadaata 'do baar matdaan' karke maharashtra main kai charan main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav kaa phayda uthaaen
 However, Pawar later tried to put an end to his statement by saying that he had said that in a "light-hearted manner"
 lekin chunaav ayog ne is bare main jaanch karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Significantly, during the 'mathri' workers' conference in Navi Mumbai, Pawar asked NCP workers to 'vote twice' to take advantage of the multi-phase Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra
 unhone matadaataaon se kaha ki ve pehle apane grih jile main matdaan karen or phir us jagah par matdaan karen jahaan ve kaam karte hai
 Addressing the activists of Satara district in western Maharashtra, Pawar said, ‚Äúin the year 2009, Satara and Mumbai had voted on the same day and people had moved to their hometown
 par is baar satara main 17 april jabaki yahaan 24 april ko matdaan hona he
 'he said,' Vote for the NCP sign 'tala' in Satara and come here to vote on 'tala'
 ' pavaar ke is bayaan par kaaryakartaaon ne khub thahaake lagaae
 However, later in a conversation with reporters, Pawar said that he had given a statement in a 'light-hearted' manner and that there was 'little sarcasm'
 up-nagareey bhandup main pavaar ne kaha, 'party kaaryakarta ek hi tarah ke chunavi bhaashanon se bor ho jate hai
 The statement i made earlier in the day was given in a light-hearted manner
 ' unhone kaha, 'mere bayaan kaa galat matlab nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 Bogus voting does not take place in our state
 ' pavaar ne party netaaon se kaha ki ve soch-samaj kar bayaan den

 Uttar Pradesh's 80 Lok Sabha seats are very important for the fate of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2014 general election
 narendra modi kii maujuudagi rajya main khaasaa asar daalane ja rahi he, kyonki bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke is ummidavaar kii vichaardhaara, charitra or vishwasaneeyata kii teen kasautiyon par apane majboot pradarshan ke dam par chautarafa rajnatik apil rahi he
 There is no confusion about Modi's ideological leanings
 unki vyaktigat eemaandaaree par kisi ko shaq nahin or ghotaalon ke is yug main yah faasla or saaf taur par ubharkar aata he
 He is considered more credible than all his rivals on the basis of a credible image as a competent administrator in Gujarat
 unke prabal virodhiyon ko bhi maananaa padegaa ki modi ne sushasan or vikaas ke mudde ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke centre main laakar khadaa kar diya heisaliye ve us aashaa or aakanksha ke pratik banakar ubhare hai, jiske liye uttar pradesh kii janata betaab he
 This people has to rely on Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, whose leadership has proved to be weak on these three criteria
 uttar pradesh ke matadaataaon ko jab bhi ummid kii koi kiran dikhaai di he, to unki aakankshaon ne jati or samudaay kii soch se upar uthakar spasht janadesh kii shakl akhriyaar kii he
 The way people came out to vote in the first phase, this sign is clearly visible
 danga peedit mujffarnagar sahit pashchimi uttar pradesh ke das nirvachan kshetron main 60 fisadi se zyada matdaan hua
 In the 2009 general election, about 51 percent of the votes were cast, while in the 2012 assembly elections, when the Samajwadi Party gave hope, the vote percentage had reached around 62
 aaj bhi puure rajya main yahi sthiti he
 Modi is considered to be a troubleshooter for the state and the country
 isi vajah se 2009 kii tulana main matdaan 10 fisadi zyada hua
 The wave is generally seen behind more than 5 percent increase in turnout
 uttar pradesh main yah jatigat samikarnon se upar modi kii hi lahar hogi
 The winning parties in both elections received an average of 33‚Äì35 per cent of the total votes cast
 2012 main akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ne vidhansabha kii 423 main se 224 siten jeetin
 During the election it is believed that Muslims and Yadavs are basically supporters of the Samajwadi Party
 par ye donon mil jaaen, to bhi sirf 92 siton par vijay dilaa sakate hai
 Then where did the remaining seats of Samajwadi Party come from? It is evident that many other castes may have voted for him
 par kyon? kyonki us samay akhilesh main matadaata ko ummid or aakanksha dikhaai di, jiske kaaran rajya ke paaramparik jaateey sameekaran nirarthak sabit hue
 There was nothing new in this
 isse pehle 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bahujan samaaj party ne 206 siten jiti thim
 Then it was believed that Mayawati had won the victory of Dalits and some Brahmins
 rajya main kareeb 110-115 siton par 33 fisadi se zyada matadaata in donon samudaayon ke hai
 Then from where did the Bahujan Samaj Party get the remaining seats? In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress won 21 seats, the reason for which is not understood by any caste equation
 congress jab chunaav main utari thi, tab use kisi mul jaateey vot bank kaa sahaara nahin tha
 Instead, MNREGA and other social welfare programs of UPA-1 raised hopes of good governance
 is achche pradarshan se uttar pradesh main party ke punerjeevan kii charchaaen hone lageen
 Then the Congress was wiped out in the 2012 assembly elections, so where did that vote bank disappear? The Congress was unable to assure good governance at that time, so the voter gave up the vote, forgetting the caste distinction
 agar sirf jaateey raajnneeti ke ghise-pite chashme se dekha jaae, to 2007 main bahujan samaaj party kii jeet se shuru hua silsilaa ulajhaa hua lagata he
 But if it is seen in the context of governance-driven politics in Uttar Pradesh in the last seven years, then it becomes clear
 main ise canavargence yani sammilan kaa siddhant kahata hum
 Today, good governance is the most important issue for voters of every caste and community
 jo bhi unki ummiido or chaahaton ko hawa degaa, vahi chunaav main fasal kaatega
 In this election, bjp's prime ministerial candidate has become a symbol of hope and aspiration for the people of Uttar Pradesh
 gujarat kii tulana main vikaas kii zyaadaatar kasautiyon par rajya pichad rahaa he
 The dissolution of the electorate of Uttar Pradesh from both the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in terms of good governance is strengthening Modi's appeal
 jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he, upie ke kharaab pradarshan ne use khel se hi baahar kar diya he
 We have seen this in the 2012 assembly elections
 aisi sthiti main modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaakar bijepi ne voton ko ekajute karne ke liye adarsh jameen taiyaar kar lee he
 There is every possibility that the state will vote above caste equations
 modi ne varanasi jaise rajya ke ek pramukh nirvachan kshetra se ladgaye kaa faisla karke bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko or badha diya he
 Therefore, if the BJP has made inroads in areas where its steps were not strong before, then it would not be surprising
 isse saaf jaahir ho jayega ki uttar pradesh ke matadaata ne raajnneeti ko aisa shirshasana karaayaa he jisase chunaav main faisla jati kii bajaae sushasan ke bal par hoga

 He anticipated arrest

 Former Sri Lankan veteran off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became elated when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed him while addressing the Tamil community of Indian origin in Sri Lanka
 modi ne yahaan apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki is samudaay ne duniya ko mahaan cricketer muthaiya muralidharan or rashtriya nayak 'purachhi taliver' mjiaar jaise tohfe die hai
 The great off-spinner expressed happiness over this and said that it is a matter of great pride for me that he (modi) took my name in his speech
 bharat duniya kaa sabase bada loktantric desh he or yah mere liye kaaphi sammanki baat he
 When Modi was talking about my country and my community, he mentioned me
 duniya ke mahanatam gendbaajon main shumaar muralidharan ne kaha ki bharat ke saath mere bahut achche sambandh rahe hai
 My wife is from South India and our ancestors were from India
 pradhanmantri modi ke bare main poochne par unhone kaha ki ve unki lokapriyata se kaaphi prabhavit hai
 He said that like everyone, we also like him
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ke liye bahut kuch kiya he
 i think people like them a lot

 Imran Khan has tweeted that it has been informed that Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia will together start an English channel, through which the challenges arising out of 'islamophobia' spread across the world
 saath hi duniya ko islam kaa paath padhaayaa jayega
 The Pakistani PM, who arrived in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly, made two tweets on Wednesday and gave information about this
 imran khan ne likhaa ki unhone aaj turki ke raashtrapati or malaysia ke pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii thi
 Misperceptions which bring people together against Muslims would be corrected; The issue of blasphemy would be properly contextualized; series & films would be produced on Muslim history to educate / inform our own people & the world; Muslims would be given a dedicated media presence
 ‚Äî Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)september 25, 2019imran khan ne kaha ki iske jariye musalamaanon ke naam par jo galatchhemiyaan failaai gai hai unhen sudhara jayega, ishaninda ke mudde se nipta jayega
 The history of Islam will be explained on this channel and people will be told about it
 ab musalamaanon ko media main ek sahi spes diya jayega
 Let me tell you that this statement of Imran Khan is coming when he himself has confessed that the Pakistani Army has been training ISI terrorists
 aise main agar pakistan kii sarkaar hi islam kaa galat istemaal karne main sabase aage rahi ho, to is tarah kaa ek channel shuru karnaa haasyaaspad lagata he

 Job is the 17th issue of the series
 akhirkaar bhartiya railway ko yah baat samaj main aa gai ki pariksha kaa shulk 500 rupee rakhane kaa koi tuk nahin tha
 It has now been decided that Rs 400 will be refunded after the examination
 arakshit shrenee ke chaatro ko bhi 250 rupee waapas kar die jaaenge
 When you are filling the IAS examination form for Rs 100, then why should you fill the Group d examination form of Railways for Rs 500, however, the Railways has understood this
 yah sateek udhaaharan he ki parikshaon ko lekar hamaari sansthaaen kitni gambhir hai
 When the railways removed the recruitment, the age limit was reduced by two years, when there was a ruckus, it was restored as before
 badlaav hi karnaa he to uskaa ek tarika he, uskaa elaan do saal pehle kiya jaae
 For four to four years, young people are preparing for jobs and when the forms are out, it is not appropriate to be excluded from the age due to fees
 yahi nahin, duusari bhartiya bhashaaon ko baahar kar diya gaya jise ab phir se behaal kiya gaya he
 So you saw that the railway department was so engrossed in taking credit for the restoration, that it was forced to change the three conditions of the exam in the middle
 abhi bhi dekhie fees ko lekar kya faisla hua he
 Money will be refunded after the examination
 kya behatar nahin hota ki jinhone nahin bharaa he unhen paisa na dene ke liye kah diya jaataa
 The history of many recruits across India is such that by submitting the money of the form, the selection commission cancels the examination
 berojgaaron ke koon paseene ke karodon rupee in aayogon ke paas jamaa he
 They are waiting for the return
 hamane khaadi gramodyog kaa hi bataaya tha ki 1200 rupee farm ke liye gaye, pariksha radd ho gai, paise kaa pataa nahin
 Do you have any reason to fill the 1200 rupee form? naukari series se tamaam sarkaron ke bheetar hadakamp to machaa he magar ve anbhavi hai
 They know that everything will become normal as soon as i get out of this issue
 vaise itani aasaani se is series se hatane vaala nahin hum
 There is no news in the country at this time more than this national loot happening with students
 17 series kaa kuch to asar hota
 This picture is of that spectacle which starts with the examination of every staff selection commission
 bhopal ke keenpi kalege of science and technolji main 21 farvari kii subah 10
 The examination was to begin at 30
 sava baarah baje bataaya jaataa he ki paper radd ho gaya he or nayaa prashn patr diya jayega
 12
 30 baje se dobaaraa pariksha shuru ho jaati he
 The rest of the students start taking the exam again but some students opposed it
 ab 12 bajkar 50 minute par bataaya jaataa he ki pariksha phir se radd ho gai
 That is, the exam was canceled twice within two to two and a half hours and started twice
 magar pariksha centre staff salection kamishan ko yah likh kar detaa he ki chaatro ne hi esayssi sijiel 2017 tear tu kii pariksha kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 Now when the students get to know this, they start committing a ruckus at the examination center
 chaatr pariksha centre par jam jate hai
 Then the police arrive
 ab baatcheet kii nautanki shuru hoti he
 Students stayed there till 9 o'clock in the night
 centre ne likhit rup se diya ki esayssi ko puri ghatana kii jaankaree di jaaegi tab jaakar chaatr vahaan se hate
 It is not known when the exam will be held again
 lekin ye haal he hamaari pariksha vyavastha kaa
 Staff Selection Commission is taking the Tier Two exam
 yah pariksha 17 farvari se lekar 22 farvari tak honi he
 The SSC has stated in its clarification that the service provider informed the Commission that due to technical problem the data is not being downloaded in some places

 What is the difference between students' claims and SSC cleanliness
 navabharat times ke narendra nath kii ek janvari kii ek report he
 The Minister of State for Personnel in the Rajya Sabha has given a written reply that between 2016-17 the posts filled by SSC i
e
 Staff Selection Commission, Union Public Service Commission and Railway Recruitment Board decreased by 12500 as compared to 2014-15
 2017 ke bajet satr main carmik rajya mantri ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 2015 main centre sarkaar kii sidhi bhartiyon 2013 ke mukaable 89 fisadi kam thim
 Now read both these figures
 sahi tasviir kaa andaaza nahin miltaa he
 Students say that the railways pulled out very little in these four years
 magar mantri ji ke aankade main esayssi, railway or upiessi main padon kii sankhya main maatr 12500 kii kami ai
 Not only this, around 20,000 students are waiting for appointment letter after passing SSC exam
 kuch vibhaagon main mila he magar abhi bhi bahut se vibhaagon se bulaave kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 a letter is being received from some department and not from anyone
 postal vibhaag par hamaari series kaa thik thaak asar padaa he
 UP students said that the postal department has started giving letters to more than 500 students
 lakhanu or gonda division main jaldi hi inaki jwining hone vaali he
 We have all requested him to never do Hindu Muslims
 is project ko chaar maheene ke andar band kara dena
 With this politics of hate and debates on TV, you can become a youth rioter, not an engineer or a doctor
 postal vibhaag ke liye chune gaye maharashtra cirkil ke chaatro ko bhi aisi khushkhabari kaa intazaar he
 They are not being given any information as to when they will receive the letter
 yahi haal film division main paas hone vaale chaatro kaa bhi he
 If our series affects the lives of 500 students, then we are thinking of doing it by May of happiness
 pehle farvari tak hi sochaa tha ab may tak karenge
 Ever since we have done this series, students have also become aware
 ve jagah jagah awaz uthaa rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, the effigy burning and pakoda frying programs are being done against the sluggishness and negligence of the selection commission
 rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kaa bhi ricard bahut kharaab he baaki rajyon ke chayan ayog kii tarah
 Unemployed students also came to meet our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh
 apni vyathaa bataai or dekha to ve bhi chaunk gayi
 Many students are also getting deposited outside NDTV Delhi office
 agar aapako prime time se apointment letters mil saktaa he to aa jaaiye
 Apart from this, you see these pictures which have come from Rajasthan
 berojgaar chaatr kis tarah pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Pakoda has entered their slogan, but why is no one taking these protests in a peaceful manner seriously
 kya netaaon ko hindu muslim taapic par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ye noujvaan naukari chhodkar phir bahak jaaenge
 In this video, the girls are starting to fall on the minister's feet
 panchayat raaj mantri rajendra rathod ke charnon main gir rahi hai taaki mantri ji jaage
 They demand that the pending recruitments of Panchayati Raj be filled
 nange badan naujavaanon kaa yah march ajmer kaa he jo upachunaav ke vakt niklaa tha
 They were organizing a march to recruit third grade teachers
 berojgaare ne andolan ko kitna rachanaatmak bana diya he, magar jo sarkarein hai un par koi asar nahin padataa he
 According to the information of Harsha, two lakh 44 thousand posts are vacant in Rajasthan
 sarkaar kaa vaada he ki is saal ke ant tak 95,667 naukariyaan di jaaengi
 According to this promise, 1
25 million posts remain vacant
 bahut se chaatr jo pariksha lekar jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai unka kya
 What is the commitment of the government on that? chaatr ye jaananaa chaahate hai
 The excuse of being stuck in a court affair does not seem very reasonable
 sarkaar or chayan ayog chaahe to adaalaton se guzarish kar jaldi faisle kii maang kar sakate hai taaki chaatro kaa jivan barbaad na ho
 There should be chaos in the state where more than 70 thousand posts are stuck in the court
 yah bataata he ki court kii haalat kitni kharaab he
 Certainly the number of judges will be less
 cese kii sankhya zyada
 The public is suffering as a result of this
 kya rajasthan sarkaar is baat kaa jawaab degi ki 2016 main police inspector ke farm bhare gaye the, abhi tak pariksha kyon nahin hui he
 Harsha's information is shocking
 kai sari parikshaon ke shulk ke rup main sarkaar ke khajaane main 428 karod waapas aa gaye hai
 What a great earning from the pockets of the unemployed
 naukari na do, unase 428 karod kama lo
 The comments yah chitthee hamaari naukari series kaa parinaam ho sakati he
 We had shown in the ninth issue that the students were waiting for joining letter after passing the examination of data entry operator in Rajasthan in june-july 2017
 jab hamane naukari series main dikhaaya to ab jaakar apointment letters milane shuru ho hue hai
 As a rule, the government should also pay this one year
 999 data entry operator ko letters milanaa shuru ho gaya he
 Congratulations to all of you
 hindu muslin na karne ke apane pran par kaayam rahiega
 Do not take dowry
 hamaari naukari series ke baad chaatro kaa kahana he ki jwining letters milanaa shuru ho gaya
 Anyone can write a good dissertation about the mental torture of the young people who are collecting data under the job series
 uttar pradesh ke sahaayak abhiyantaaon ke patr mili hai
 He passed the examination, joined the job but all got dismissed
 adaalat ne kaha ki inhen behaal kiya jaae magar abhi tak inaki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 After all, what is the reason that this is happening in every state
 abhi bhi dekhie fees ko lekar kya faisla hua he
 Money will be refunded after the examination
 kya behatar nahin hota ki jinhone nahin bharaa he unhen paisa na dene ke liye kah diya jaataa

 Harsha's information is shocking

 Students freeze at the examination center

 In the 2017 budget session, the Minister of State for Personnel had told the Lok Sabha that the direct recruitment of the central government in 2015 was 89% lower than in 2013
 ab in donon aankadon ko padhein
 The exact picture is not known
 chaatr kehete hai ki railway ne in chaar varshon main bhartee bahut kam nikaali
