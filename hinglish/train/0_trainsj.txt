 The politics of Pakistan started from Kashmir and ended at Kashmir
 us pakistan kii neend hindustan ke ek faisle ne uda di he
 Now the issue of Kashmir has become the bone of the throat for Pakistani politicians
 jo naa ugala ja rahaa he naa niglaa ja rahaa he
 On the one hand, all Pakistani attempts to surround India at the international level have failed
 duusari taraf pakistani netaaon ko us avam kaa bhi saamana karnaa he
 Which till now they have been fooling in the name of Kashmir
 sarhad ke us paar baukhalaahat kaa alam ye he ki ab pakistani raashtrapati vishwa yuddh kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 Pakistani leaders went disrespected by going to America
 china ke paas gaye to madad nahin mili
 Russia already refused
 sanyukt raashtra ne bhi pakistan kii shikaayat par gaur nahin kiya
 So now the new threat of Pakistan has emerged
 pakistani raashtrapati aarif alvi ne kah daalaa ki kashmir par hoga teesraa vishwa yuddh
 Jihad will answer India ajeeb adaalat he pakistani raashtrapati aarif alvi kii
 He also likes peace
 or jihad bhi karnaa chaahate hai
 They are also threatening more world war
 ise gussa kaha jaae
 To be called irritant
 yaa tanha rah jane kii jalan
 Because the issue of Kashmir on which the Pakistani President is conducting World War
 usee kashmir ke masale par puri duniya main unka mulk beabaru ho chukaa he
 From China to America
 rus se lekar saudi tak pakistani netaa puri duniya ke chakkar laga aae
 But no one agreed to stand with them
 zaahir he ab pakistan ne ranneeti hi badal daali
 And then he adopted the same 70-year-old policy
 jihad kii policy
 In fact, none of these countries joined Pakistan in the Kashmir case, despite claiming to be friends with China, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia
 yahaan tak ki kuch arab mulk pakistan ke bajaae bharat ke faisle ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 And Pakistan's hand remained empty
 ghati se dhara 370 hataae jane ke khilaaf pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan duniya ke kai deshon ke rashtradhyakshon se phone par baat kar chuke hai
 Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is touring continuously
 baavjood iske kahin se bhi pakistan ko jammu-kashmir mudde par dilasa nahin mila he
 Leave it to the world, Pakistan is finding it difficult to show its own face to its people
 lihaaza yom-e-azaadi yani pakistani swatantra diwas ke maukey par pradhanmantri imran khan ne mulk ko jawaab dene ke liye raashtrapati aarif alvi ko aage kar diya
 And they excitedly threatened not only the war of India but also started giving the world a call for world war
 pakistani raashtrapati aarif alvi pakistan ke 73wein swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par islamabad ke jinna kanvension centre main bol rahe the
 After threatening World War and Jihad, the Pakistani President also threatened to take the issue of Kashmir to the UN Security Council
 
 While Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi himself has agreed that this is not so easy
 magar pakistani he ki maanane ko raji nahin
 And on the one hand President Arif Alvi is threatening World War, while Prime Minister Imran Khan is spewing poison against India not only in pok
 balki bharat ko eent kaa jawaab pathar se dene kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 The Kashmiri people may be happy after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, but Pakistani Hukmarans are badly shocked
 pakistani raashtrapati se lekar pradhanmantri tak or unke mantri tak bharat ko dhamkaane kii lagaataar himakat kar rahe hai
 But beating the streak after the convoy passes is of no use
 ye pakistan ko samajhnaa hoga

 ) The essence of all religions of the world is the same
 har majahab main satya, ahimsa, prem, karunaa, bhaichara, sahansheeltaa, sadachaar aadi par jor diya gaya he
 The essence of the sermon that Christ gave about 2000 years ago is also similar
 bible main sangrah kiye gaye isa messiah ke upadesh padhakar kisi bhi insaan ke man kaa andhera dur ho saktaa he
 These are not just empty teachings, but also stand the test of logic
 aage bible se chuni hui 21 line di gai hai, jinhen apane jivan main utarkar koi bhi vyakti ek sachcha insaan ban saktaa he
 
 
 1
 prabhu ke aage bhent chadhaane yaa prarthana karne se pehle tum apane bhai se mail-milaap karo
 If you have a feeling of hatred towards your loved ones, then you can become truly entitled to pray by abandoning them
 2
 It is just as wrong to look at a foreign woman as physically fornication with someone
 agar teri dahini aankh tuje thokar khilaae, to use nikaalkar phenk de
 It is good for you that even if one part is destroyed, the whole body is saved from being thrown into hell
 3
 It is said that do not swear falsely, but i say never to swear
 apane sir kii bhi shapath na khaanaa, kyonki apane sir ke ek bhi bal ko tum apni marji se safed yaa kaala nahin kar sakate
 4
 agar koi tumhaare daahine gaal par thappad martha he, to uski tarah doosraa gaal bhi pher do
 If someone wants to get your kurta after getting it done, then let him take his sheet too
 5
 If someone asks you for a loan, never turn your back on him
 6
 You should also love those who have a feeling of hatred towards you
 jo tumhen sataate hai, tum unke liye bhi prarthana karo
 The sun illuminates both those who practice religion and those who are unrighteous
 agar tujh keval unheen se prem karoge, jo tumhen prem karte hai, to isse tumhen kya fal milegaa?7
 Do not do religious work just to show others
 8
 If you donate with the right hand, do not let the left hand know about this
 9
 God knows everything
 tumhaare maangane se pehle hi prabhu ko yah maaloom he ki tumhaari jaruratein kya-kya hai
 10
 aane vaale kal kii koi chintaa mat karo, kal kaa din apni chintaa khud kar legaa
 Today's suffering is enough for today
 prabhu se bas aaj dinabhar kii roti maango
 Who among you, who can worry, can increase his age even by one hour? 11
 agar tum dusron ke aparaadh ko maaf karoge, to prabhu tumhaare gunaah maaf karenge
 If you do not forgive others, you will not be forgiven even in the court of the Lord
 12
 If you fast, never let the sadness on your face
 dusron ko apane upwas kaa pataa na chalane do
 13
 dharti ke is jivan ke liye kabhi dhan-daulat jamaa na karo, jahaan chor use chura le jate hai
 Save money for yourself in heaven, where there is no fear of thieves etc
 14
 If your eyes will be pure, then your whole body will also be pure
 agar teri najar acchhee hogi, to tumhaara jivan ujaale se bharaa hoga
 15
 koi bhi insaan ek saath do swaamiyon kii seva nahin kar saktaa
 You cannot serve both God and money together
 16
 Do not worry about what you will eat or drink for your life
 sharir ke liye yah chintaa na karnaa ki kya pahanenge
 Is not life better than food and body than clothes? If Prabhu protects the soul and body, then leave the rest to his will
 17
 Look at the birds flying in the sky
 ve na to kuch bote hai, na katate hai, phir unka paalan koun karata he? phir tumhaara mol to un parindon se bhi zyada he
 18
 jis tarah tum dusron par dosha, lagaate ho, usee tarah tum par bhi dosha lagaaya jayega
 The scale with which you measure others will also be measured by you
 19
 He who asks, gets it
 jo dhundta he, vah paata he
 The one who knocks the door is opened
 20
 Just as a good tree produces good fruit and a bad tree produces bad fruit, similarly good deeds result in good and bad deeds result in bad
 21
 Who among you, who gives stones to his child when he asks for bread? Do you give him a snake when you ask for a fish? If the worst of people knows how to give good things to their children, then why would God the Supreme God not give you only good things

 Former police minister Babulal Nagar of Rajasthan, accused of rape, has agreed to his medical examination after three days of police action

 Government hospitals in Chhattisgarh are in a state of disarray
 is baat kaa sahi-sahi andaja rajdhani raipur ke sarkari aspataalon kii dasha ko dekhakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Being the state capital, there is a presence here from the Chief Minister to the top officials
 tamaam sarkari vibhaagon ke vibhaagadhyaksh bhi yaheen basate hai
 In such a situation, it is natural to think that health services should be effective and quality in Raipur instead of remote areas of the state, but the reality is the opposite
 padhen kya he vaastaviktaa?raipur ke sabhi 35 sarkari aspataalon kaa bura haal he
 The main reason for this is that specialist doctors have been made babu in government offices instead of doctors
 jabaki aspataalon main marijon kaa ilaaj junior doctoron ke hawaale he
 Junior doctors doing internships are treating patients ranging from general patients to critical illnesses
 darasal, sarkaar ke ek aadesh ne marijon kii jaan saansat main daal di he
 Senior doctors have been engaged in administrative work
 zyaadaatar doctor rashtriya swasthya kaarykram ke sanchaalan prabharee ban gaye hai
 The remaining doctors have been linked to non-health services

 Both are doctors of children but they too are posted in DHS office and are being made Babugiri
 gauratlab he ki doctoron kaa mul kaam marijon kii chikitsa kar unki jaan bachaana he, lekin raipur jile main 300 se zyada doctor gaiyr chikitsk kaaryo main laga die gaye hai
 As a result, medical care of patients in all government hospitals is in the hands of junior doctors and staff nurses and compounders
 duusari ore sarkari aspataalon main marijon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 In the absence of doctors, many times patients have to be admitted to private hospitals
 aise main jab rajya ke swasthya sanchaalak en ke shukla se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone babugiri kar rahe tamaam doctoron ke pareekshan karwaane kii baat kahi
 He also said that the benefit of specialist doctors should be given to the patients

 Shah claimed, 'they (police) withdrew from the planned route and took the path where there was a traffic jam
 mujhe shradhanjali dene ke liye vivekanand ke awaas par nahin jane diya gaya or main isse dukhi hum
 On the other hand, Mamta Banerjee reacted to this and described Shah as 'goon'
 unhone shahar ke behaala kii raily main kaha, 'agar aap vidyasagar tak haath le jate hai to main aapako gunde ke alaava kya kahuungi
 He said, 'I hate your ideology, i hate your ways

 Government airlines, which are struggling with the crisis, may create more problems for the CAG report
 pehle se hi paison kii tangi jhel rahi air india par kaig ne ungali uthaate hue kaha he ki karj lekar 111 vimaan kharidne kaa faisla hi air india ko le duba
 Surprisingly, the then CAG report does not mention the then aviation minister Praful Patel in this report, while the role of the civil aviation ministry and the government has been questioned in the report
 niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) ne desh main nagar vimaanashetra ke kaamkaaj par apni taaja report main air india ke vimaan kharid saude kii tikhi aalochana karte hue kaha he ki karj ke sahare 111 vimaan kharid saude kaa qaraar is is sarkari airline ke liye ‘sankat ko daavat dene’ jaisaa tha
 In a report presented in Parliament on Thursday, the CAG questioned Air India, the civil aviation ministry and the government's role, saying the deal was "vendor-motivated"
 ‘badi sankhya main’ vimaan kharidne kii pahal ko ‘jokhimaura’ kadam bataate hue rapat main kaha gaya he ki isse sarkaar ke kaan khadey ho jane chahie the
 The purchase of these aircraft brought the burden of heavy debt liability of Rs 38,423 crore on the airline till March last year
 report main sarkari ankekshak ne air india or indian airlines ke vilay ko ‘galat samay main’ kiya gaya vilay qaraar diya he
 "it was a feast on the crisis and should have raised the ears of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and Planning Commission," the report said
 ’kaig ne vimaanan company ke prabandhan ke sambandh main sarkaar ko puri tarah se vyavhaarik rukh apnaane kaa suzav diya
 The CAG found in the investigation that the acquisition process took an 'unreasonably long time'
 kaig ne kaha ki shuruaati prastaav disambar, 1996 main kiya gaya tha or isaki samiksha janvari, 2004 tak jari rahi jab 28 vimaanon kii kharid kii yojana taiyaar kii gai or baad main isamen badlaav kar 68 vimaan kharidne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 The CAG said that the revised plan had dramatically increased the number of aircraft to be purchased and the developments that took place by November 2004 showed that Air India "acted in haste" on its earlier plan before the merger
 
 report main kaha gaya, ‘bazaar kii jaruraton jisamen tatkaaleen jarurat or bhavi jarurat shaamil hai or saath hi in adhigrahan ke liye jo tark die gaye hai unki vyavsaayik vyavhaaryata vimaanon kii sankhya main vruddhi ko lekar kiye gaye ankekshan kii jaanch main sahi nahin baithte
 Commenting on the 'fast pace' of the 68 aircraft procurement process, the CAG said that while it took 8 years to decide on the first plan for the purchase of 28 aircraft, 'between August 2004 and December 2005 by Air India The second plan was prepared, it was approved by the board, with its approval by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Planning Commission, Department of Expenditure, Public Investment Board, Empowered Group of Ministers and Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs

 ’sanshodhit yojana ke liye kai anumaanon ko ‘doshapurn’ pate hue kaig ne kaha ki baatcheet kii prakriya ‘aniyamit thi or isse prakriya kii paardarshita buree tarah prabhavit hui
 The CAG said that no benchmark was set regarding price comparison and business acumen
 is tarah ke benchmark kii anupasthiti main yah tay karnaa mushkil he ki kis tarah se keemat par pahunchaa gaya
 The government auditor put the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the dock for showing generosity in bilateral air traffic eligibility with countries not providing equal opportunities for development to Air India
 kaig ne kaha, ‘is sthiti main air india sahit bhartiya vimaanan companiyon ko sthapit antarrashtriya ‘diggaj vimaanan companiyon’ ke saath prabhavi tareeke se pratispardhaa karne main nayi evam gambhir chunautiyon se nipatna hoga
 The CAG noted other factors responsible for Air India's downturn were 'operational deficiencies, weak financial position, inadequate equity capital and undue reliance on financing through loans
 iske alaava, vimaan eendhan kii oonchi keemten or vaishvik mandi se bhi vimaanan company buree tarah prabhavit hui
 CAG said, "the airline is in a crisis situation
 vetan bhugtan or atief kii dendariyon kaa bhugtan karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 If the airline has to survive, management and employees must set aside personal interests and make some drastic decisions

 There were women and Brahmins with it
 yahi vajah he ki 80 saal ke umr ke padaav par hone ke baavjood shila dikshit congress ke liye dilli main jaruri ban gayi

 saf ali khan kii bahupratikshit home production film 'agent vinod' release ho gai he
 
 
 The story goes that a spy of the Indian intelligence agency RAW gets murdered in Russia, and another RAW agent Vinod, ie Saif Ali Khan, is sent to solve the case, who learns that the conspiracy to attack with nuclear bomb Is going on ab 'agent vinod', yani indian james bond, bond jaise hi kapadon or style ke saath passport or visa kii phikr kiye bagaiyr world tour par rahata he
 
 
 He does not die when the enemy is killed, or perhaps the enemy does not kill him in the manner
 
 
 har baar
 
 
 But what about this, except for spy cameras and smartphones, 'agent Vinod' looks much poorer than Bond in the case of highlife gadgets
 
 
 khayr karina kapur pakistani doctor bani hai, lekin sawaal uthta he ki aakhir kaise vah jasoos banakar kharatnaak hatyaron ke bich apni life ko manage kar rahi hai
 
 
 The doctor is badly injured, but breaks the glass of the building and makes a sound, after hearing the agent standing half a kilometer away
 
 
 yahi he puri film kaa sabase kamazor or kanfujd kairactor
 
 
 Nuclear bomb kept in 'agent Vinod' helicopter is about to explode, but she is busy talking emotional to Lady Doctor
 
 
 tabhi pataa nahin kaise, is ladi doctor ko newclear bam kaa password yaad aa jaataa he
 
 
 The comments 'agent vinod' kii kahani everej he
 
 
 Perhaps that's why director Shriram Raghavan has made the film in such a way that people can trust it by being confused
 
 
 or isiilie behad stylish editing ke saath tezi se kahani ko ghumaya gaya, jo angese rakhata he
 
 
 There is good action at the beautiful locations of Morocco, Latvia, Afghanistan and Russia
 
 
 climax main bhi jaan he
 
 
 The music is already a hit with songs like 'rabta', but the best part is the fun and intelligent dialogues of 'agent Vinod', which will not stop without laughing
 
 
 phir aisa kya he, jisase film pakistan main bain kar di gai
 
 
 Probably because India is the target in the film and some of the agents of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI are involved in the conspiracy
 
 
 haalanki bellencing act dikhaate hue saf ne sajeesh main kuch bhartiya bhi shaamil dikhaae hai, lekin pakistani sensor board yakeen nahin kar paaya
 
 
 Actually, you have to believe the heart more than the mind while watching the film, just like you do when watching a Bond film
 
 
 'agent vinod' totality (totallity) main entertaning package he, or iske liye hamaari reating he - 3 star
 
 
 Now 'agent Vinod', ie Indian James Bond, stays on the world tour with the same clothing and style as Bond, without worrying about passport and visa
 
 
 dushman ke maarane par vah marataa nahin, yaa shaayad dushman use dhang se nahin martha

 This is the weakest and confused character of the entire film
 
 
 'agent vinod' ke helicopter main rakhaa newclear bam fatne vaala he, lekin vah ladi doctor se imotional baaten karne main biji he
 
 
 Only then do not know how, this lady doctor remembers the password of the nuclear bomb
 
 
 tippaniyan The story of 'agent Vinod' is average
 
 
 shaayad isiilie diarector shriram raghavan ne film kuch is tarah banaai he ki log kanfus hokar is par bharosa kar len
 
 
 And that's why the story was quickly rotated with the very stylish editing that Engage holds

 'rabta' jaise geeton ke saath music to pehle hi hit he, lekin sabase acchhee baat he, 'agent vinod' ke mazedaar or intellegent dialogs, jo hansaae bagaiyr nahin rahenge
 
 
 Then what is it that made the film banned in Pakistan
 
 
 shaayad isliye, kyonki film main nishane par bharat he or sajeesh rachane waalon main pakistani khufia agency iesai ke kuch agents shaamil hai
 
 
 Though Saif has shown some Indian involvement in the conspiracy while showing the balancing act, the Pakistani censor board could not believe it
 
 
 darasal film dekhte vakt aapako dimag se zyada dil par yakeen karnaa padegaa, jaise aap bond film dekhte vakt karte hai
 
 
 'agent Vinod' is an entertainment package in totality, and our rating for this is - 3 stars

 In one stroke, over 16 lakh students' hard work was destroyed

 This exam is counted among the most difficult examinations in the world
 aapako bataa den ki iske tahat kareeb 3 million (30 lakh) college seat ke liye kareeb 10 million (1 karod) bachche paper dete hai
 Children prepare for this paper for about 10 years

 On the other hand children in India live under pressure and work hard

 At the same time, examination centers are monitored through drones
 pariksha karaane kii jimmedaari sirf shiksha mantralay hi nahin, balki grih mantralay, internet mantralay, supreme pipuls court or police ko di jaati he
 Even after all these things, if the paper leaks, then a sentence of 7 years is given

 Evidence of this was given by a group of langurs in Washim, Maharashtra
 darasal hua ye ki langur kaa ek baccha naale main gir gaya
 His mother and other langurs tried hard to get him out of the drain but failed
 aise main ek doodh vaale ne langur ke bachche ko naale se nikaalane ke liye aage aayaa
 The milkman took the baby of the langur from the drain
 asli kahani iske baad shuru hui
 The milkman wanted to take the baby of the langur with him
 languron kii toli ko doodh vaale kaa iraadaa samaj aa gaya
 Now the langurs started moving towards the milkman one by one
 pehle to doodh vaale ne pathar dikhaa kar bhagane kii koshish kii
 Even after this, when the langur continued to grow to redeem the child, the milkman tried to drive them away with a stick in his hand
 phir kya tha sabhi languron ne mil kar hallaa bol diya
 The milkman killed hands and feet for some time
 lekin phir usne languron kii ekajutata ke aage haar maanane main hi behatari samajhi
 By then, the mother of the langur child clung to her chest and climbed a pillar
 ye puraa tamaasha 10-15 minute tak sadak par chalata rahaa
 During this time traffic also stopped
 har koi ruk kar is ladaai ko dekhtaa rahaa

 An interesting picture was seen in the Delhi Secretariat on Thursday when Minister Gopal Rai made the mlas and government officials sit face to face and pass the funds for the Smart Village Project
 darasal,dillike 365 gaanvon ke liye smart village project yojana dilli sarkaar ne pichley saal shuru kii thi
 On this occasion, the Union Minister Gopal Raine said that the budget of Rs 600 crore was allocated last year by the Delhi government for the smart village project, but the authorities deliberately did not pass a single rupee file, due to which the development of the villages could not be done properly
 adhikariyon ke nakaaraapan ke chalate 600 karod rupee kaa yah puraa bajet leps ho gaya
 Sometimes an excuse for not being an employee, sometimes an excuse for not passing a file
 iske alaava kabhi dm se na milane kaa bhi bahaanaa banaaya gaya
 Gopal Rai said that the Village Development Board held frequent meetings
 gram vikaas board ne takreeban 8 baithken kii or bajet kaa prastaav paas kiya, magar ejeeniyar or DM ke paas file jaati rahi or ye latakate gaye
 Due to this, not a single rupee has been done in the villages
 dillike mantri gopal raay ne kaha kividhayakalagataar apil kar rahe the ki iske liye ek vishesh satr chalaaya jaae, isliye guuruuvaar or shuukravaar 2 din dilli sachivalay main sabhi sambandhit vibhaagon ke adhikariyon or vidhayakon kii aamane-samnebaithkkarai ja rahi he
 The advantage of this campaign is that on Thursday, 160 files have been cleared from DM and 107 files have been cleared from Flood Department
 gopal raay ne kaha ki abhi hand tu hand 9 crores rupee kaa fund aavantit ho chukaa he
 He said that the Kejriwal government is committed to the development of villages
 isliye 18 maheene se latake hue kaamon ko raftaar di ja rahi he

 Sun is considered to be the soul of a person in astrology
 iskaa kharaab hona saare jivan ko ast-vyast kar detaa he
 It is related to father, state, state service, honor, dignity
 sharir main pachan tantra, ankhen or haddiyaan surya se hi sambandhit hoti hai
 Life becomes rich and prosperous when the Sun is strong
 kamjor hone par daridrata or kharaab swasthya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Three types of Raja Yoga are formed mainly from the Sun which give immense prestige to a person
 surya kaa pehla rajyog veshi hota he
 Due to the placement of a planet in the next house of the Sun in the horoscope, Veshi Yoga is formed
 parantu ye grah chandramaa, rahu yaa ketu nahin hone chahie
 Apart from this, the Sun should not be weak and do not have sinful planets
 tabhi jaakar veshi yoga kaa laabh miltaa he
 Influence and caution of Veshi Yoga- a person is a good speaker and rich when this yoga is done
 - aise logon kaa shuruaati samay kaaphi kathinaayee main bitta he
 - But later these people earn a lot of wealth, wealth and fame
 - aise logon ko apane khan-paan kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 - And jaggery must be eaten
 surya kaa doosraa rajyog- washi- surya ke pichley ghar main kisi grah ke hone par washi yoga ban jaataa he
 - But these planets should not be lunar, Rahu or Ketu
 - surya ko bhi papakrant nahin hona chahie
 Only then will this yoga give auspicious results

 surya kaa teesraa rajyog- ubhaychari yoga- surya ke pehle or pichley, donon bhav main grah hon to ubhaychari yoga banataa he
 - But these planets should not be lunar, Rahu or Ketu
 - iske alaava surya ke saath koi paap grah na ho
 - Nor should there be sight of any sin planet on the Sun
 - tab yah shubh yoga faleebhoot hota he
 These are the surest ways to please Shani Dev
 The effect and caution of auspicious yoga - when this yoga is done, a person reaches from a very small place to a great height
 - iske kaaran vyakti apane kshetra main bahut prasiddhi praapt karata he
 - Due to this yoga a person gets out of every problem
 - iske kaaran vyakti ko raajnneeti or prashasan main bade pad mil jate hai
 - When this yoga happens, keep fast on Sunday

 In the case of Sheena Bora's murder, the layers that are opening up every day, on the lines of a thriller film, are increasing people's interest day by day
 shina bora kii hatya kisne kii, kis makasad se kii or kaise kii is par lag rahe kayaas aajkal media kaa pasandida shagal ban chuke hai
 Sheena's mother Indrani Mukherjee, accused of murder, is revealing the colors of her character, which is difficult for the common man to even imagine
 indrani ne kis kisase shaadi kii, kitne bachche hue or kise kyon chhod diya, ye unki nijee zindagi kaa hissaa ho saktaa he lekin kisi bhi samaaj main apni hi bachche kii berahami se hatya maanviyata ke daayre se baahar maani jaati he
 Even if the allegation is not proved, the statement of Indrani's current husband Peter Mukherjee that his wife presented his daughter Sheena like his younger sister, shakes the foundation of the wife's trust in the relationship
 kaise koi patni itani badi baat dil ke kisi kone main chipa kar rakh sakati he or patni hi kyon uski jagah koi pati bhi hota to itani badi baat, apane ateet kaa ek bada hissaa kaise apane vartmaan se alag-thalag rakh saktaa he
 While walking and sleeping, would it not have bothered that the secret would have opened? 
 
 
 There is enough to soothe peace
 aisa karne ke liye pathar kaa dil chahie
 The news received so far is about to upset the relationship
 ye shina kaa hi nahin rishton or inaki samvedansheeltaa kaa katl he
 Money, power and choice is such an obsession that killed 21-year-old Sheena at the hands of her own people
 9 maheene tak bachche ko garbh main paalane vaali maa ke liye apni santan ko khatm kar dene kii khabar kisi ke bhi munh ko khulaa or ankhon ko fata chhodane ke liye kaaphi he
 It is the job of the police to find out and prove why this has happened, but the allegations on this famous person of high profile society show the filth which is often covered
 is gandagi ke chhiten kis-kis ke daaman ko daagdar karte hai vakt batayega lekin bahut se safedposhon ke liye yahaan jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 The comments ek bhai ko bahan ke katl ke kaaran kaa pataa he, saboot he wo chup rahaa
 The mother threatened her son to withhold the money
 pati-patni ,maa-bahan ke saath saath bhai bahan ke rishte bhi sawaal ke katghare main khadey hai
 If brother Mikhail Bora knew as if he had claimed in front of the media, then it seems from him that for financial gain he stole his sister's murder? filmein ab real life se prerana dhundne lagi hai
 This murder has become a spice that baffles even a film writer
 ab is par film banane kaa elaan ho gaya he 
 Hopefully, as the film ends with a thriller unraveling, this real-life drama will end with punishment for the murder convict and expose those who were directly or in any way involved in the plot
 Are
 bhale hi aarope sabit na hua ho lekin indrani ke maujuuda pati peter mukherjee kaa ye bayaan ki unki patni ne apni beti shina ko apni choti bahan kii tarah pesh kiya, pati patni ke vishwaas ke rishton kii neenv hilaa detaa he
 How can a wife hide such a big thing in any corner of the heart, and why would the wife be a husband instead of her, then such a big thing, how can a big part of her past keep herself isolated from her present
 sote jaagate chalate-phirte kya ye dar nahin sataata hoga ki raaj khul gaya to
 
 
 
 chaiyn kii neend udaane ke liye kaaphi he
 To do this, a heart of stone is needed
 abhi tak milin khabaren rishton ko taar-taar kar dene vaali hai
 This is not only Sheena's murder of relationships and their sensitivity
 paisa, power or pasand ye aisa junun he jisane 21 saal kii shina ko usee ke apano ke haathon marava daalaa
 The news of a mother raising a child for 9 months to kill her child is enough to leave anyone's mouth open and eyes cracked
 kyon hua hoga ye pataa karnaa or sabit karnaa police kaa kaam he lekin hai profile sosayadi ke is nami shaksiyat par lage aarope us gandagi ko dikhaate hai jis par aksar pardaa padaa rahata he
 It will tell the time when the peel of this filth is tainted, and it can be difficult for many white-collar people to answer here
 tippaniyan a brother knows the reason for the slaughter of the sister, the proof is he remained silent

 The relationship of husband-wife, mother-sister as well as siblings also stand in question

 ye katl aisa masala ban gaya he jo kisi filmi katha likhane vaale ko bhi chakra de
 It has now been announced to make a film on it
 ummid karte hai jaise film kaa ant ek thriller ke sulajhane ke saath ho jaataa he vaise hi is real life drame kaa ant hatya ke doshi ko sazaa milane or un logon ke benakaab hone se hoga jo is saazish main sidhe yaa kisi bhi tarah se shaamil rahe hon

 By reading this book it can be understood how Bihar is changing
 ek samay tha jab bihar ke log apane ko bihar kaa nivasee maanane se kataraate the
 That was a transition period

 The impact of demonetisation on the common man started from 9 November and continues till now
 deshbhar main naukari-pesha or pension paane waalon kii bank or atm ke baahar qatari lagi he
 Everyone has a challenge to withdraw their October salary and pension
 kuch logon ko 2000 se 2500 rupee nikaalane main safalataa mil chuki he to kuch log abhi bhi apane number kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, in a few days, November salary and pension will start reaching bank accounts
 logon ko dar he ki kahin oktober kii selary or pension nikaalane ke liye lagi qatari main unki november kii selary yaa pension na funs jaae
 Challenging the banks There has been chaos in the banks after the central government declared the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes as illegal
 bainkon ke baahar gaiyrkanoonee ho chuki noton ko badalane ke liye kabhi na khatm hone vaali qatari lagi he
 New ration of 2000 to 2500 rupees is being received outside the ATM like ration
 bainkon ke saamne chunauti jald se jald is umadi bheed ko nipataane kii he
 But he himself is getting a new currency
 ab kitni karency vah bank ke counter se vitarit kare or kitni karency ko atm mashin main lagaae
 His challenge is still not over
 jari kii gai 500 rupee or 2000 rupee kii nai karency ko abhi bhi deshbhar main faile 2
 Out of 25 lakh atms, only 90,000 thousand atms can be fitted
 bache hue atm main sirf 100 rupee kii note hi daali ja rahi he
 Will your salary or pension be available in time? The last week of every month is very important for banks
 deshbhar main sabhi companiyon or sarkari vibhaagon ke karmchaariyon kii selary or ritair karmchaariyon kii pension unke bank khate main pahunch jaati he
 In the last week of the month, the government treasury and government and non-government banks have to do this work
 isse pehle sabhi sarkari vibhaag or privet company apane karmchaariyon kii atendence ko jodakar unhen di jane vaali selary kaa puraa hisaab-kitaab kar bank ko soochna muhaiyaa kara dete hai
 Along with this, all government departments and private companies also have to deposit sufficient amount in their accounts so that the bank can easily do the work of giving salary to the employees
 rajya or kendra sarkaar kii chunautilekinnotbandi ke asar se jahaan bainkon ke paas nai karency kii kami haveheen zyaadaatar sarkari vibhaag or privet companiyaan bhi is kaam ko puraa karne main museebaton kaa saamana kar rahi he
 The government of many states of the country has demanded advance grant from the Reserve Bank, so that it can pay salaries to employees on time
 kuch rajyon ne to khulkar thikra kendra sarkaar par bhi phod diya yadi unhen jald se jald nai karency uplabdh nahin karai gai to vah karmchaariyon ko selary nahin de paaenge
 At the same time, there is a bigger challenge before the central government
 vah puure desh main faile kendriya karmchaariyon ke saath-saath railway or sena jaise bade sansthaanon ko selary or pension vitarit karata he
 Apart from this, there is pressure on him to pay increased salary and pension also through 7th Pay Commission
 jahaan rajya sarkaron ko mahaj apane rajya ke andar hi selary or pension kaa intjaam karnaa padataa he vahiin kendra sarkaar ko deshbhar main is intjaam ke saath-saath videshon main kaam kar rahe karmiyon kii bhi vyavastha kerani padati he
 Even if salary comes into the account, the cash will come out? As soon as the salary or pension comes to the bank account, the biggest priority is the necessary expenses of the month
 iske liye aamtaur par sabhi ko badi rakam bank yaa atm se nikaalani padati he
 Most people living in a rented house have to pay the house rent at the beginning of the month
 jin logon kaa makaan maalik se bank qaraar rahata he vah to aasaani se makaan maalik ke pan number kaa istemaal kar uske khate main kiraaya jamaa kara detaa he
 The challenge is for those who pay cash rent to the landlord
 ab notebandi se ai cash kii samasya ke bich atm kii kataraa main kitni baar lagakar kiraaya adaa karne ke liye paisa nikaalega? yaa phir vah bank kii qatari main lagakar kira adaa karne ke liye paisa nikaalega? uske paas ek vikalp apane makaan maalik ko check jari karne kaa he lekin kya uskaa makaan maalik check lene ko taiyaar hoga?makaan ke kiraye ke baad uskaa anya bada kharch ghar kaa rasad, skool kii fees or anya jaruri sevaaon ke liye die jane vaale paise hai
 Will it be possible for the common man to withdraw money for each of his essential tasks in time, given the chaos at bank and atms and the daily new limit of withdrawal by the Reserve Bank
 yaa phir yah tay he ki uski november kii selary oktober kii qatari main funs kar rah jaaegi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane griharajya gujarat main bijepi ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman shanivaar se apane haath main lene ja rahe hai
 It is believed that Modi will address more than 30 election rallies in Gujarat
 abhi tak bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah gujarat main 33 jilon main kaaryakarta sammelnon kaa aayojan kar chuke hai
 After bringing the workers in 'full-active mode', the bjp's strategy now is to cash out the 'modi Magic' in the Prime Minister's home state
 bijepi gujarat chunaav main ek taraf hitech prachaar par jor de rahi he
 At the same time, at the grassroots level, continuous feedback is being taken about people's pulse
 bijepi ne gujarat ke sabhi 182 vidhansabha kshetron main ek-ek kollcenter banaaya he
 The BJP has so far approached 1 crore, 80 lakh people in Gujarat through these callcenters
 is hitech takanic se jahaan bijepi chunaav abhiyaan par feedback leti he vahiin bijepi ke paksh main vot dene kii apil bhi karti he
 Based on the feedback, the BJP decides the direction of electoral politics
 bijepi kii ranneeti ke shah khud party adhyaksh amit shah hai
 The role of Panna Chiefs (page Incharge) is given great importance in their election gameplan
 panna pramukh yani voters list ke har pej ke liye party kaa alag incharge
 In all the elections that have been contested under Amit Shah's strategy, the skills of the Panna chiefs were the mainstay
 bataa den kigujaratki 182 siton ke liye rajya main kul 50,128 booth hai
 An average of 18 emeralds per head for a booth
 ek panna pramukh par kam se kam 60 or zyaada se zyaada 80 matadaataaon kii jimmedaari he
 They have to ensure that their page voters reach the polling booth and their vote goes to the party candidate
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri modi ne 16 oktober ko rajya bhar ke panna pramukhon ke sammelan ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Apart from this, BJP is also putting a lot of emphasis on 'door to Door' campaign every day
 is abhiyaan main 4 se 6 mantri har din shaamil ho rahe hai
 Along with campaigning at the grassroots level, the BJP is bringing new campaigns every day on social media
 pehle charan ke matdaan ke liye ab 25 din kaa vakt hi rah gaya he
 In such a situation, Gujarat wants to shoot every arrow of its political quiver
 gujarat chunaav prachaar main jis tarah congress ne is baar shuru se hamalavar rukh apana rakhaa he, use dekhte hue ye sahi he ki bijepi ko gujarat ke pichley chunaavon ke mukaable is baar zyada mehnat kerani pad rahi he
 This is the reason that every small and big BJP leader is turning towards Gujarat
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee is baat par modi sarkaar par nishaanaa bhi saadh chuki hai ki aakhir ek rajya ke chunaav ke liye kyon puri kendriya sarkari mashinari ko gujarat bheja ja rahaa he
 Obviously, this time the election of Gujarat is not just a question of one state, but because of this, the condition and direction of the future politics of the country is fixed
 varsh 2002 ke baad ye pehla mauka he jab gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main narendra modi mukhyamantri pad ke liye bijepi ke cheharaa nahin hai
 In such a situation, bjp's victory in the home state is also a question of own credibility for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 har ek kii jubaan par yahi sawaal he ki gujarat main is baar siyaasi oont kis karavat baithegaa
 Will the same mandate come which has been in every assembly election in Gujarat for the last 22 years? Which means BJP will again succeed in feeding lotus in this stronghold for the sixth time? Or will the Congress be able to reverse this time on the basis of its Vice President Rahul Gandhi's line of 'soft Hindutva' and the caste card of PODA (patidar, OBC, Dalit, Adivasi)? You will have to wait for December 18 to know this

 qareeb saat saal pehle olympic ek padak ne haryana ke is boxr ko qareeb-qareeb gumnami kii duniya se uthaakar ek superstar khilaadi bana diya
 But the boxer decided to leave the sport like Olympic and Asiad and adopt professional boxing which has left the Indian boxing world uncomfortable at the moment
 magar vijender maanate hai ki isse unke fans kii sankhya kam nahin hogi
 Vijender says that he will still do boxing and people will know him as an Indian boxer, so he does not have to be desperate
 lekin bhartiya boxing camp main bhi is khabar se halchal machi hui he
 It is obvious that coach Gurubksh Singh Sandhu, who was with Vijender for a long time, is also surprised by this
 lekin bhartiya boxing ke edock cameti ke chairman kishan narsi khush hai or kehete hai, 'vijender teen olympix khel chuke hai
 He is entitled to play as a professional boxer
 ' wo ye bhi kehete hai, 'wo bahut pratibhashali hai isliye bhartiya camp main yuva mukkebaazon ko unki kami zarur khalegi
 'but Kishan Narsee says that young players can talk to him and take tips
 lekin bhartiya coach or edock cameti ke sadsy gurubaksh singh sandhu kehete hai ki wo hairaan bhi hai or maayoos bhi
 He believes that this may affect the morale of the team as Vijender is a big name in the boxing world
 vijender ke peshewar khilaadi banane ke faisale ke peeche paisa ek badi vajah he isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Now Vijender will have to get into the ring at least six times a year
 in dinon vijender queensbari promotions ke saath training kar rahe hai
 The company is owned by Frank Warren's sons - Francis and George Warren
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki unhen har baar karodon rupee kii kamai ho sakati he
 The comments vijender ne is baat kii ore bhi ishaara kiya he ki in sabake peeche unke federation main baraabar jhagade ne bhi unhen or duusare mukkebaazon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 By the way, Vijender being professional is also not the first incident of Indian boxing
 sidney olympix main padak se chook jane vaale gurcharan singh, rajkumaar sangwan, gobi yadav (dies yadav), venkatesan devarajan or dilbagh singh jaise mukkebaaz pehle bhi peshewar boxing kaa rasta apana chuke hai
 But just like winning his Olympic medal, Vijender suddenly surprised everyone once again by changing the boxing ring
 haryana ke khel mantri anil vij ne yahaan tak kaha he ki vijender ko ab tak khel kii badaulat jo kuch bhi hasil hua un sab par sochane kii zarurat he or unpar vichaar kiya jayega
 Vijender, who has gone on his own from the boxing ring to the advertising world and from TV shows to film personalities, is about to step into another world of boxing
 lekin khelpremi ye ummid zarur rakhenge ki peshewar boxing main bhi wo itnaa naam kamaayen ki ek mashhoor or umdaa bhartiya mukkebaaz ke taur par hi jane jaaen
 About seven years ago, an Olympic medal won the Haryana boxer from the world of near-oblivion a superstar player
 lekin is boxr ne olympic or asiad jaise khelon ko chhodkar peshewar boxing ko apnaane kaa faisalaa kiya jisane filhal bhartiya boxing kii duniya asahaj ho gai he
 But Vijender believes that this will not reduce his number of fans
 vijender kaa kahana he ki wo ab bhi boxing hi karenge or log unhen ek bhartiya mukkebaaz ke taur par janenge isliye unhone maayoos hone kii zarurat nahin he
 But this news has created a stir in the Indian boxing camp too
 zaahir hai lambey samay se vijender ke saath rahe coach gurubaksh singh sandhu bhi isse hairaan hai
 But Kishan Narsee, Chairman of the Adhoc Committee of Indian Boxing, is happy and says, 'vijender has played three Olympics
 wo peshewar boxr ke taur par khilne ke haqadaar hai
 He also says, 'he is very talented, so young boxers in Indian camp will surely miss him
 ' lekin kishan narsi kehete hai ki yuva khilaadi unase phone par baat kar tips le sakate hai
 But Indian coach and member of the ad hoc committee, Gurubakhsh Singh Sandhu, says that he is shocked and disappointed
 unka maananaa he ki isse team ke manobal par asar pad saktaa he kyonki vijender boxing kii duniya main ek bada naam he
 Money is a big reason behind Vijender's decision to become a professional player
 ab vijender ko saal main kam se kam chah baar ring main utarana padegaa
 These days, Vijender is training with Queensbury Promotions
 ye company frank warren ke beton- fransis and jorge warren kii company he
 Therefore it is believed that they can earn crores of rupees every time
 tippaniyan Vijender has also pointed out that behind him, equal fights in his federation have also hurt him and other boxers
 vaise vijender kaa peshewar hona bhartiya boxing kii pehali ghatana bhi nahin he
 Boxers like Gurcharan Singh, Rajkumar Sangwan, Gobi Yadav (DS Yadav), Venkatesan Devarajan and Dilbag Singh, who missed medals at the Sydney Olympics, have taken the professional boxing route earlier
 lekin vijender ne apane olympic padak jeetne kii tarah hi achaanak boxing kaa ring badalakar sabko ek baar phir hairaan kar diya he
