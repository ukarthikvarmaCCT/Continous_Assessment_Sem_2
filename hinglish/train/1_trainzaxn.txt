ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future

 !!! aap bhi apane aasapaas badi-badi kothiyaan, badi-badi gadiyon ko dekhte honge
 If you look at the big cities of the country, then in one city you will find lakhs of people with income above 10 lakh annually
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki desh kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree ke andolan ko or adhik takat dene kii zarurat he
 Because of the success of this fight against corruption, black money, it is very natural to discuss what will happen to the unscrupulous, what will be done to the unscrupulous, what will be the punishment for the unscrupulous
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, kanoon, kanoon kaa kaam karegaa, puri kathorta se karegaa
 But the government also has priority on how to help the believers, how to get security, how to reduce the hardship of those who live a life of honesty
 eemaandaaree adhik pratishthit kaise ho
 This government is the friend of the gentlemen and is in favor of creating a suitable environment to return the wicked to the path of gentleness
 vaise yah bhi ek kadava satya he ki logon ko sarkaar kii vyavasthaaon, kuch sarkari afasaron or lalaphitaashahee se jude katu anubhav hote rahete hai
 This harsh truth cannot be denied
 is baat se koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki nagarikon se zyaada jimmedaari afasaron kii he, sarkaar main baithe chote-bade vyakti kii he, or isliye chaahe centre sarkaar ho, rajya sarkaar ho yaa phir sthaneey nikaay, sabakaa daayitv he ki saamaanya se saamaanya vyakti ke adhikaar kii raksha ho, eemaandaaron kii madad ho or beyimaan alag-thalag hon
 Friends, puri duniya main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki aatankwaad, naksalwad, maowad, jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale, drugs ke dhandhe se jude log, maanav taskari se jude log, kaale dhan par hi nirbhar rahete hai
 It became a canker for society and governments
 is ek nirnay ne in sab par gahari chot pahunchaai he
 Today, a large number of youth are returning to the mainstream
 agar ham jaagruk rahen, to apane bacchon ko hinsa or atyaachaar ke un raaston par waapas lautne se bachaa paaenge
 The success of this campaign also lies in the fact that the money that was outside the mainstream of the economy has returned to the mainstream of the economy through banks
 pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chaalaaki ke raste khojane vaale beyimaan logon ke liye, aage ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Technology has done a great service in this
 adatan beyimaan logon ko bhi ab technology kii takat ke kaaran, kaale kaarobaar se nikalakar kanoon-niyam kaa paalan karte hue mukhyadhara main aana hoga
 Colleagues, bank karmchaariyon ne is dauraan din-raat ek kiye hai
 Thousands of women bank employees have also stayed till late night and are involved in this campaign
 post offis main kaam karne vaale log, bank mitra, sabhi ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Yes, in the midst of your Bhagiratha effort, some people have also witnessed serious crimes in some banks
 kahin-kahin sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi gambhir aparaadh kiye hai or adatan phayda uthaane kaa nirlajj prayaas bhi hua he
 They will not be spared
 yah desh ke banking system ke liye ek svarnim avasar he
 On this historic occasion, i want to urge all the banks of the country to say one thing
 itihaas gavaah he ki hindustan ke bainkon ke paas ek saath itani badi maatra main, itane kam samay main, dhan kaa bhandar pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 Respecting the independence of banks, i urge that the bank move out of its traditional priorities and now conduct its work keeping the poor, lower middle class and middle class in the country at the center
 hindustan jab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi varsh ko garib kalyaan varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he, tab bank bhi lokhit ke is avasar ko haath se na jane den
 As soon as possible, take appropriate decisions and take appropriate steps in public interest
 jab nishchit lakshya ke saath niti banati he, yojanaayen banati hai to labhaarthi kaa shashaktikaran to hota hi he, saath hi saath iske taatkaalik or doorgaami fal bhi milte hai
 Pie-pie is closely monitored, it also ensures the possibility of good results
 gaanv-garib-kisaan, dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit or mahilaayein, jitani shashakt hongi, aarthik rup se apane pairon par khadi hongi, desh utana hi majboot banegaa or vikaas bhi utana hi tej hoga
 Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government

 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future
 jai hind
 
 
 !!! bhrashtachar, kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai kii safalataa ke kaaran yah charchaa bahut swaabhaavik he ki ab beyimaanon kaa kya hoga, beyimaanon par kya beetegi, beyimaanon ko kya sazaa hogi
 Brothers and sisters, law, will work law, with full rigor
 lekin sarkaar ke liye is baat kii bhi praathamikta he ki eemaandaaron ko madad kaise mili, suraksha kaise mili, eemaandaaree kii zindagi bitaane waalon kii kathinaayee kaise kam ho
 How can honesty be more prestigious
 yah sarkaar sajjanon kii mitra he or durjanon ko sajjanta ke raste par lautaane ke liye upyukt vaataavaran ko taiyaar karne ke paksh main he
 It is also a bitter truth that people have bitter experiences related to government systems, some government officials and red tape
 is katu satya ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Who can deny that officers have more responsibility than citizens, small and big people sitting in government, and so whether it is central government, state government or local body, it is the responsibility of all that ordinary people
 May the right to be protected, the help of the believers and the dishonest be isolated
 doston, It is a well-known fact all over the world that people dealing with terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency, drug trade, human trafficking, depend on black money
 yah samaaj or sarkaron ke liye nasoor ban gaya tha
 This one decision has hurt all these deeply
 aaj kaaphi sankhya main noujvaan mukhyadhara main laut rahe hai
 If we remain aware, we will be able to save our children from returning to those paths of violence and atrocities
 is abhiyaan kii safalataa is baat main bhi he ki arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara se baahar jo dhan tha, vah bainkon ke madhyam se arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara main waapas aa gaya he
 The events of the last few days have proved that for unscrupulous people who find ways of cunning, further avenues have been closed
 technology ne isamen bahut badi seva kii he
 Even habitually dishonest people, due to the power of technology, will have to come out of the black business and follow the law and rule in the mainstream
 saathiyon, Bank employees have united day and night during this period
 hajaaron mahila bank karmchaaree bhi der raat tak rukkar is abhiyaan main shaamil rahi hai
 The people working in the post office, bank friends, all have done commendable work
 haa, aapke is bhageerath prayaas ke bich, kuch bainkon main kuch logon ke gambhir aparaadh bhi saamne aae hai
 At some places, government employees have also committed serious crimes and habitual efforts have been made to take advantage of habit
 inhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 It is a golden opportunity for the country's banking system
 is aitihaasik avasar par main desh ke sabhi bainkon se aagrahpurvak ek baat kahana chahta hum
 History bears witness that the banks of India had never before come to such a large amount of money in such a short time
 bainkon kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karte hue meraa aagrah he ki bank apni paramparaagat praathamiktaaon se baahar nikalakar ab desh ke garib, nimna madhya varg or madhyam varg ko centre main rakhkar apane kaary kaa aayojan kare
 When Hindustan is celebrating the birth centenary year of Poor Deendayal Upadhyay as the year of poor welfare, banks should not let this opportunity of public interest go away by hand
 ho sake, utana jaldi lokhit main uchit nirnay karen or uchit kadam uthaaen
 When a policy is made with a definite goal, plans are made, the beneficiary is empowered, as well as its immediate and far-reaching consequences
 pai-pai par baarik najar rahati he, isse achche parinaamon kii sambhaavna bhi pakki hoti he
 Village-poor-farmers, Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and women, the stronger they are, the more economically they stand on their feet, the stronger the country becomes and the faster the development
 sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas : is dhyey vaakya ko charitaarth karne ke liye navvarsh kii purv sandhya par desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ke liye sarkaar kuch nai yojanaayen laa rahi he
 Friends, even after so many years of independence, millions of poor people in the country do not have a home of their own
 jab arthvyavastha main kaala dhan badha, to madhyam varg kii pahunch se ghar bhi khareednaa dur ho gaya tha
 The government has taken some major decisions to help poor, lower middle class, and middle class people buy houses
 ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success
 sava sau karod kaa desh ho, 65 pratishat jansankhya 35 saal se kam umr ke naujavaanon kii ho, saadhan bhi hon, sansaadhan bhi hon or samarthy main koi kami na ho, aise hindustan ke liye koi kaaran nahin he, ki vah ab peeche rah jaae
 The comments nae varsh kii nai kiran, nai safaltaaon kaa sankalp lekar aa rahi he
 Come, let us all go together and go over obstacles
 
 
 ek nae ujjwal bhavishya kaa nirmaan karen
 Jai Hind
 
 
 !!! This government is the friend of the gentlemen and is in favor of creating a suitable environment to return the wicked to the path of gentleness
 vaise yah bhi ek kadava satya he ki logon ko sarkaar kii vyavasthaaon, kuch sarkari afasaron or lalaphitaashahee se jude katu anubhav hote rahete hai
 This harsh truth cannot be denied
 is baat se koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki nagarikon se zyaada jimmedaari afasaron kii he, sarkaar main baithe chote-bade vyakti kii he, or isliye chaahe centre sarkaar ho, rajya sarkaar ho yaa phir sthaneey nikaay, sabakaa daayitv he ki saamaanya se saamaanya vyakti ke adhikaar kii raksha ho, eemaandaaron kii madad ho or beyimaan alag-thalag hon
 Friends, puri duniya main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki aatankwaad, naksalwad, maowad, jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale, drugs ke dhandhe se jude log, maanav taskari se jude log, kaale dhan par hi nirbhar rahete hai
 It became a canker for society and governments
 is ek nirnay ne in sab par gahari chot pahunchaai he
 Today, a large number of youth are returning to the mainstream
 agar ham jaagruk rahen, to apane bacchon ko hinsa or atyaachaar ke un raaston par waapas lautne se bachaa paaenge
 The success of this campaign also lies in the fact that the money that was outside the mainstream of the economy has returned to the mainstream of the economy through banks
 pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chaalaaki ke raste khojane vaale beyimaan logon ke liye, aage ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Technology has done a great service in this
 adatan beyimaan logon ko bhi ab technology kii takat ke kaaran, kaale kaarobaar se nikalakar kanoon-niyam kaa paalan karte hue mukhyadhara main aana hoga
 Colleagues, bank karmchaariyon ne is dauraan din-raat ek kiye hai
 Thousands of women bank employees have also stayed till late night and are involved in this campaign
 post offis main kaam karne vaale log, bank mitra, sabhi ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Yes, in the midst of your Bhagiratha effort, some people have also witnessed serious crimes in some banks
 kahin-kahin sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi gambhir aparaadh kiye hai or adatan phayda uthaane kaa nirlajj prayaas bhi hua he
 They will not be spared
 yah desh ke banking system ke liye ek svarnim avasar he
 On this historic occasion, i want to urge all the banks of the country to say one thing
 itihaas gavaah he ki hindustan ke bainkon ke paas ek saath itani badi maatra main, itane kam samay main, dhan kaa bhandar pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 Respecting the independence of banks, i urge that the bank move out of its traditional priorities and now conduct its work keeping the poor, lower middle class and middle class in the country at the center
 hindustan jab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi varsh ko garib kalyaan varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he, tab bank bhi lokhit ke is avasar ko haath se na jane den
 As soon as possible, take appropriate decisions and take appropriate steps in public interest
 jab nishchit lakshya ke saath niti banati he, yojanaayen banati hai to labhaarthi kaa shashaktikaran to hota hi he, saath hi saath iske taatkaalik or doorgaami fal bhi milte hai
 Pie-pie is closely monitored, it also ensures the possibility of good results
 gaanv-garib-kisaan, dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit or mahilaayein, jitani shashakt hongi, aarthik rup se apane pairon par khadi hongi, desh utana hi majboot banegaa or vikaas bhi utana hi tej hoga
 Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future

 !!! vaise yah bhi ek kadava satya he ki logon ko sarkaar kii vyavasthaaon, kuch sarkari afasaron or lalaphitaashahee se jude katu anubhav hote rahete hai
 This harsh truth cannot be denied
 is baat se koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki nagarikon se zyaada jimmedaari afasaron kii he, sarkaar main baithe chote-bade vyakti kii he, or isliye chaahe centre sarkaar ho, rajya sarkaar ho yaa phir sthaneey nikaay, sabakaa daayitv he ki saamaanya se saamaanya vyakti ke adhikaar kii raksha ho, eemaandaaron kii madad ho or beyimaan alag-thalag hon
 Friends, puri duniya main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki aatankwaad, naksalwad, maowad, jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale, drugs ke dhandhe se jude log, maanav taskari se jude log, kaale dhan par hi nirbhar rahete hai
 It became a canker for society and governments
 is ek nirnay ne in sab par gahari chot pahunchaai he
 Today, a large number of youth are returning to the mainstream
 agar ham jaagruk rahen, to apane bacchon ko hinsa or atyaachaar ke un raaston par waapas lautne se bachaa paaenge
 The success of this campaign also lies in the fact that the money that was outside the mainstream of the economy has returned to the mainstream of the economy through banks
 pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chaalaaki ke raste khojane vaale beyimaan logon ke liye, aage ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Technology has done a great service in this
 adatan beyimaan logon ko bhi ab technology kii takat ke kaaran, kaale kaarobaar se nikalakar kanoon-niyam kaa paalan karte hue mukhyadhara main aana hoga
 Colleagues, bank karmchaariyon ne is dauraan din-raat ek kiye hai
 Thousands of women bank employees have also stayed till late night and are involved in this campaign
 post offis main kaam karne vaale log, bank mitra, sabhi ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Yes, in the midst of your Bhagiratha effort, some people have also witnessed serious crimes in some banks
 kahin-kahin sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi gambhir aparaadh kiye hai or adatan phayda uthaane kaa nirlajj prayaas bhi hua he
 They will not be spared
 yah desh ke banking system ke liye ek svarnim avasar he
 On this historic occasion, i want to urge all the banks of the country to say one thing
 itihaas gavaah he ki hindustan ke bainkon ke paas ek saath itani badi maatra main, itane kam samay main, dhan kaa bhandar pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 Respecting the independence of banks, i urge that the bank move out of its traditional priorities and now conduct its work keeping the poor, lower middle class and middle class in the country at the center
 hindustan jab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi varsh ko garib kalyaan varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he, tab bank bhi lokhit ke is avasar ko haath se na jane den
 As soon as possible, take appropriate decisions and take appropriate steps in public interest
 jab nishchit lakshya ke saath niti banati he, yojanaayen banati hai to labhaarthi kaa shashaktikaran to hota hi he, saath hi saath iske taatkaalik or doorgaami fal bhi milte hai
 Pie-pie is closely monitored, it also ensures the possibility of good results
 gaanv-garib-kisaan, dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit or mahilaayein, jitani shashakt hongi, aarthik rup se apane pairon par khadi hongi, desh utana hi majboot banegaa or vikaas bhi utana hi tej hoga
 Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind

 !!! doston, It is a well-known fact all over the world that people dealing with terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency, drug trade, human trafficking, depend on black money
 yah samaaj or sarkaron ke liye nasoor ban gaya tha
 This one decision has hurt all these deeply
 aaj kaaphi sankhya main noujvaan mukhyadhara main laut rahe hai
 If we remain aware, we will be able to save our children from returning to those paths of violence and atrocities
 is abhiyaan kii safalataa is baat main bhi he ki arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara se baahar jo dhan tha, vah bainkon ke madhyam se arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara main waapas aa gaya he
 The events of the last few days have proved that for unscrupulous people who find ways of cunning, further avenues have been closed
 technology ne isamen bahut badi seva kii he
 Even habitually dishonest people, due to the power of technology, will have to come out of the black business and follow the law and rule in the mainstream
 saathiyon, Bank employees have united day and night during this period
 hajaaron mahila bank karmchaaree bhi der raat tak rukkar is abhiyaan main shaamil rahi hai
 The people working in the post office, bank friends, all have done commendable work
 haa, aapke is bhageerath prayaas ke bich, kuch bainkon main kuch logon ke gambhir aparaadh bhi saamne aae hai
 At some places, government employees have also committed serious crimes and habitual efforts have been made to take advantage of habit
 inhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 It is a golden opportunity for the country's banking system
 is aitihaasik avasar par main desh ke sabhi bainkon se aagrahpurvak ek baat kahana chahta hum
 History bears witness that the banks of India had never before come to such a large amount of money in such a short time
 bainkon kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karte hue meraa aagrah he ki bank apni paramparaagat praathamiktaaon se baahar nikalakar ab desh ke garib, nimna madhya varg or madhyam varg ko centre main rakhkar apane kaary kaa aayojan kare
 When Hindustan is celebrating the birth centenary year of Poor Deendayal Upadhyay as the year of poor welfare, banks should not let this opportunity of public interest go away by hand
 ho sake, utana jaldi lokhit main uchit nirnay karen or uchit kadam uthaaen
 When a policy is made with a definite goal, plans are made, the beneficiary is empowered, as well as its immediate and far-reaching consequences
 pai-pai par baarik najar rahati he, isse achche parinaamon kii sambhaavna bhi pakki hoti he
 Village-poor-farmers, Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and women, the stronger they are, the more economically they stand on their feet, the stronger the country becomes and the faster the development
 sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas : is dhyey vaakya ko charitaarth karne ke liye navvarsh kii purv sandhya par desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ke liye sarkaar kuch nai yojanaayen laa rahi he
 Friends, even after so many years of independence, millions of poor people in the country do not have a home of their own
 jab arthvyavastha main kaala dhan badha, to madhyam varg kii pahunch se ghar bhi khareednaa dur ho gaya tha
 The government has taken some major decisions to help poor, lower middle class, and middle class people buy houses
 ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success
 sava sau karod kaa desh ho, 65 pratishat jansankhya 35 saal se kam umr ke naujavaanon kii ho, saadhan bhi hon, sansaadhan bhi hon or samarthy main koi kami na ho, aise hindustan ke liye koi kaaran nahin he, ki vah ab peeche rah jaae
 The comments nae varsh kii nai kiran, nai safaltaaon kaa sankalp lekar aa rahi he
 Come, let us all go together and go over obstacles
 
 
 ek nae ujjwal bhavishya kaa nirmaan karen
 Jai Hind

 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success
 sava sau karod kaa desh ho, 65 pratishat jansankhya 35 saal se kam umr ke naujavaanon kii ho, saadhan bhi hon, sansaadhan bhi hon or samarthy main koi kami na ho, aise hindustan ke liye koi kaaran nahin he, ki vah ab peeche rah jaae
 The comments nae varsh kii nai kiran, nai safaltaaon kaa sankalp lekar aa rahi he
 Come, let us all go together and go over obstacles
 
 
 ek nae ujjwal bhavishya kaa nirmaan karen
 Jai Hind
 
 
 !!! The success of this campaign also lies in the fact that the money that was outside the mainstream of the economy has returned to the mainstream of the economy through banks
 pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chaalaaki ke raste khojane vaale beyimaan logon ke liye, aage ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Technology has done a great service in this
 adatan beyimaan logon ko bhi ab technology kii takat ke kaaran, kaale kaarobaar se nikalakar kanoon-niyam kaa paalan karte hue mukhyadhara main aana hoga
 Colleagues, bank karmchaariyon ne is dauraan din-raat ek kiye hai
 Thousands of women bank employees have also stayed till late night and are involved in this campaign
 post offis main kaam karne vaale log, bank mitra, sabhi ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Yes, in the midst of your Bhagiratha effort, some people have also witnessed serious crimes in some banks
 kahin-kahin sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi gambhir aparaadh kiye hai or adatan phayda uthaane kaa nirlajj prayaas bhi hua he
 They will not be spared
 yah desh ke banking system ke liye ek svarnim avasar he
 On this historic occasion, i want to urge all the banks of the country to say one thing
 itihaas gavaah he ki hindustan ke bainkon ke paas ek saath itani badi maatra main, itane kam samay main, dhan kaa bhandar pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 Respecting the independence of banks, i urge that the bank move out of its traditional priorities and now conduct its work keeping the poor, lower middle class and middle class in the country at the center
 hindustan jab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi varsh ko garib kalyaan varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he, tab bank bhi lokhit ke is avasar ko haath se na jane den
 As soon as possible, take appropriate decisions and take appropriate steps in public interest
 jab nishchit lakshya ke saath niti banati he, yojanaayen banati hai to labhaarthi kaa shashaktikaran to hota hi he, saath hi saath iske taatkaalik or doorgaami fal bhi milte hai
 Pie-pie is closely monitored, it also ensures the possibility of good results
 gaanv-garib-kisaan, dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit or mahilaayein, jitani shashakt hongi, aarthik rup se apane pairon par khadi hongi, desh utana hi majboot banegaa or vikaas bhi utana hi tej hoga
 Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future
 jai hind
 
 
 !!! saathiyon, Bank employees have united day and night during this period
 hajaaron mahila bank karmchaaree bhi der raat tak rukkar is abhiyaan main shaamil rahi hai
 The people working in the post office, bank friends, all have done commendable work
 haa, aapke is bhageerath prayaas ke bich, kuch bainkon main kuch logon ke gambhir aparaadh bhi saamne aae hai
 At some places, government employees have also committed serious crimes and habitual efforts have been made to take advantage of habit
 inhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 It is a golden opportunity for the country's banking system
 is aitihaasik avasar par main desh ke sabhi bainkon se aagrahpurvak ek baat kahana chahta hum
 History bears witness that the banks of India had never before come to such a large amount of money in such a short time
 bainkon kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karte hue meraa aagrah he ki bank apni paramparaagat praathamiktaaon se baahar nikalakar ab desh ke garib, nimna madhya varg or madhyam varg ko centre main rakhkar apane kaary kaa aayojan kare
 When Hindustan is celebrating the birth centenary year of Poor Deendayal Upadhyay as the year of poor welfare, banks should not let this opportunity of public interest go away by hand
 ho sake, utana jaldi lokhit main uchit nirnay karen or uchit kadam uthaaen
 When a policy is made with a definite goal, plans are made, the beneficiary is empowered, as well as its immediate and far-reaching consequences
 pai-pai par baarik najar rahati he, isse achche parinaamon kii sambhaavna bhi pakki hoti he
 Village-poor-farmers, Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and women, the stronger they are, the more economically they stand on their feet, the stronger the country becomes and the faster the development
 sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas : is dhyey vaakya ko charitaarth karne ke liye navvarsh kii purv sandhya par desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ke liye sarkaar kuch nai yojanaayen laa rahi he
 Friends, even after so many years of independence, millions of poor people in the country do not have a home of their own
 jab arthvyavastha main kaala dhan badha, to madhyam varg kii pahunch se ghar bhi khareednaa dur ho gaya tha
 The government has taken some major decisions to help poor, lower middle class, and middle class people buy houses
 ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment

 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi

 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he

 !!! Bank employees have united day and night during this period
 hajaaron mahila bank karmchaaree bhi der raat tak rukkar is abhiyaan main shaamil rahi hai
 The people working in the post office, bank friends, all have done commendable work
 haa, aapke is bhageerath prayaas ke bich, kuch bainkon main kuch logon ke gambhir aparaadh bhi saamne aae hai
 At some places, government employees have also committed serious crimes and habitual efforts have been made to take advantage of habit
 inhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 It is a golden opportunity for the country's banking system
 is aitihaasik avasar par main desh ke sabhi bainkon se aagrahpurvak ek baat kahana chahta hum
 History bears witness that the banks of India had never before come to such a large amount of money in such a short time
 bainkon kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karte hue meraa aagrah he ki bank apni paramparaagat praathamiktaaon se baahar nikalakar ab desh ke garib, nimna madhya varg or madhyam varg ko centre main rakhkar apane kaary kaa aayojan kare
 When Hindustan is celebrating the birth centenary year of Poor Deendayal Upadhyaya as the year of poor welfare, banks should not let this opportunity of public interest go away by hand
 ho sake, utana jaldi lokhit main uchit nirnay karen or uchit kadam uthaaen
 When a policy is made with a definite goal, plans are made, the beneficiary is empowered, as well as its immediate and far-reaching consequences
 pai-pai par baarik najar rahati he, isse achche parinaamon kii sambhaavna bhi pakki hoti he
 Village-poor-farmers, Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and women, the stronger they are, the more economically they stand on their feet, the stronger the country becomes and the faster the development
 sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas : is dhyey vaakya ko charitaarth karne ke liye navvarsh kii purv sandhya par desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ke liye sarkaar kuch nai yojanaayen laa rahi he
 Friends, even after so many years of independence, millions of poor people in the country do not have a home of their own
 jab arthvyavastha main kaala dhan badha, to madhyam varg kii pahunch se ghar bhi khareednaa dur ho gaya tha
 The government has taken some major decisions to help poor, lower middle class, and middle class people buy houses
 ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it

 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money

 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies

 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success
 sava sau karod kaa desh ho, 65 pratishat jansankhya 35 saal se kam umr ke naujavaanon kii ho, saadhan bhi hon, sansaadhan bhi hon or samarthy main koi kami na ho, aise hindustan ke liye koi kaaran nahin he, ki vah ab peeche rah jaae
 The comments nae varsh kii nai kiran, nai safaltaaon kaa sankalp lekar aa rahi he
 Come, let us all go together and go over obstacles
 
 
 ek nae ujjwal bhavishya kaa nirmaan karen
 Jai Hind
 
 
 !!! Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future

 !!! ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness

 !!! Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and will transfer to the accounts of farmers
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
 ab sarkaar ise lagbhag doguna karte hue isamen 20,000 karod rupee or jod rahi he
 This amount will be given by NABARD, Cooperative Banks and Societies at low interest and the financial loss that will be incurred by NABARD will also be borne by the government
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki agle teen maheene main teen karod kisaan credit cardon ko RUPAY card main badla jayega
 One drawback to the Kisan Credit Card was that one had to go to the bank to withdraw money
 ab jab kisaan credit card ko RUPAY card main badal diya jayega, to kisaan kahin par bhi apane card se kharid-bikri kar paaegaa
 Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind

 !!! gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success

 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment

 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income

 !!! Brothers and sisters, just as agriculture is important in the country's economy, small and medium industries, also known as msmes, have an important contribution for development and employment
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is kshetra ke liye kuch nirnay liye hai, jo rojgaar badhaane main sahaayak honge
 The government has decided to increase the credit guarantee for small businesses from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore
 bharat sarkaar ek trust ke madhyam se bainkon ko yah guarantee detii he ki aap chote vyapaariyon ko lone dijie, guarantee ham lete hai
 Till now it was a rule that loans up to one crore rupees were covered
 ab 2 karod rupee tak kaa lone credit guarantee se cover hoga
 The loan given from NBFC i
e
 non-banking Financial Company will also be covered
 sarkaar ke is faisle se chote dukandaaron, chote udyogon ko zyaada karj milegaa
 The interest rate on these will also be lower due to the expenses borne by the central government
 sarkaar ne bainkon ko yah bhi kaha he ki chote udyogon ke liye cash credit limit ko 20 pratishat se badhaakar 25 pratishat karen
 Apart from this, working capital loans have been increased from 20 percent to 30 percent on digital transactions
 november main is sector se jude bahut se logon ne cash diposit kiya he
 Banks have been asked to take cognizance of this while deciding the working capital
 kuch din pehle hi sarkaar ne chote kaarobaariyon ko tex main badi raahat dene kaa bhi nishchay kiya tha
 Those who do business up to Rs 2 crore in a business year, their tax was calculated assuming 8 percent income
 ab aise vyapaaree ke digital lenden par tex kii gananaa 6 pratishat aay maanakar kii jaaegi
 In this way their tax will be reduced considerably
 doston, The success of the Mudra scheme has certainly been very encouraging
 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves
 aaj aavashyaktaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal - HOLIER THAN THOU - se alag hatakar, mil-baithkar paardarshita ko praathamikta dete hue, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan se raajnneetik dalon ko mukt karaane kii disha main sahi kadam uthaaen
 In our country, everyone, from ordinary citizens to the President, has said about the simultaneous elections to the Lok sabha-assembly simultaneously
 aedin chal rahe chunavi chakra, usase utpann aarthik boj, tathaa prashasan vyavastha par bane boj se mukti paane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind
 
 tippaniyan The new ray of the new year is bringing new successes
 aaie, ham sab milakar chal paden, baadhaon ko paar karte chalem
 
 
 Create a new bright future

 pichley saal kareeb-kareeb saadhe teen karod logon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya he
 The government intends to double it now, giving priority to dalit-adivasi-backward, and women
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi ek deshvyapee yojana kii shuruyaat kii ja rahi he
 Now in all, more than 650 districts of the country, the government will provide financial assistance of Rs 6,000 to pregnant women for hospital registration and delivery, vaccination and nutritious diet
 yah raashi garbhvatee mahilaon ke account main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme will go a long way in reducing maternal mortality in the country
 vartmaan main yah yojana 4,000 kii aarthik madad ke saath desh ke sirf 53 jilon main payalat project ke tahat chalaai ja rahi thi
 The government is also going to start a scheme for senior citizens
 bank main zyaada paisa aane par aksar bank diposit par interest rate (byaaj dar) gata dete hai
 This should not affect the senior citizens, hence 7
 5 lakh rupee tak kii raashi par 10 saal tak ke liye salanaa 8 pratishat kaa interest rate surakshit kiya jayega
 Senior citizens can get this amount of interest every month
 bhrashtachar, kaala dhan kii jab bhi charchaa hoti he, to rajaneta, raajnneetik dal, chunaav ke kharch, ye sari baaten charchaa ke centre main rahati hai
 Now the time has come that all politicians and political parties should respect the feelings of honest citizens of the country, understand the public anger
 yah baat sahi he ki raajnneetik dalon ne samay-samay par vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarthak prayaas bhi kiye hai
 All the parties together have voluntarily accepted the restrictions on themselves

 Now the time has come to debate it, find a way
 hamaare desh main har sakaaratmak parivartan ke liye hameshaa sthaan rahaa he
 Now a lot of positive changes are being seen in the society regarding digital transactions too
 zyaada se zyaada log isse jud rahe hai
 Just yesterday, the government has launched a completely indigenous platform - BHIM for digital transactions in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 BHIM yani bharat interphes for mani
 i urge the youth of the country, the merchant class, the farmers to join more and more of BHIM
 saathiyon, diwaali ke baad jo ghatnakram rahaa, nirnay hue, nitiyaan baniin - inkaa moolyankan arthshaastri to karenge hi, lekin acha hoga ki desh ke samajashastri bhi is puure ghatnakram, nirnay or nitiyon kaa moolyankan karen
 As a nation, the village of India, the poor, the farmers, the young, the educated, the illiterate, the men and women, have all shown immense patience and public power
 kuch samay ke baad 2017 kaa nayaa varsh prarambh hoga
 The movement for Satyagraha was started for the first time in Champaran under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1917, 100 years before today
 in dinon hamane dekha ki 100 varsh ke baad bhi hamaare desh main sachai or achchhai ke prati sakaaratmak sanskaar kaa mulya he
 Today Mahatma Gandhi is not, but his path, which inspires us to urge the truth, is the most appropriate
 champaran satyagrah kii shatabdi ke avasar par ham phir ek baar mahatma gandhi kaa punarsmaran karte hue satya ke agrahi banenge to sachai or achchhai kii patari par aage badhane main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 We should not let this fight against corruption and black money stop
 satya kaa aagrah, sampurna safalataa kii guarantee he
 If it is a country of 125 crores, 65 percent of the population is of youth below 35 years, they also have resources, resources and there is no shortage of power, there is no reason for such a country to be left behind

 !!! The Bhuvalaka Steel Company of Sri Lanka has agreed to give passports to Indian laborers
 company ke emdi susheel bhuwalka ne enditivi india ko phone kar bataaya ki qaraar ke mutabik agar koi majdoor chah maheene kii notice die bina hi chhodkar jaataa he to use sirf passport waapas diya jayega
 We are ready to give that
 lekin, vetan or baaki suvidhaayen nahin milengi kyonki unke kaam band karne se or achaanak chhodkar jane se company kaa bhi nuksaan ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, a laborer named Azad Alam told NDTV India on phone that two Indian High Commissioners had arrived at 10 am
 lekin, hamane unase maang kii he ki hamaara do maheene kaa bakaayaa vetan bhi dilaayaa jaae or desh waapas bheja jaae
 Actually, the Bhuvalaka Steel Company in which these laborers work is from Bangalore
 june 2014 main vahaan kaam karne gaye 77 mazdooron main zyaadaatar uttar pradesh or bihar ke rahane vaale hai
 Those workers who worked in Steel Melting Soap (SMS) have alleged that the company pressures them to produce 140 tonnes
 utana production nahin kar paane par company ne do maheene se unka vetan roak rakhaa he or khaane kaa paisa bhi nahin de rahi he
 However, the MD of the company claims that on the 2nd of this month, the laborers have been given food money and the salary of November has been withheld because they have produced only 70 percent of their work
 disambar se to factory main kaam hi band he
 According to the company, according to the agreement, six months notice has to be given to leave the work, so that other workers can be arranged in their place
 is bich enditivi par khabar chalane ke baad videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne srilanka main bhartiya ucchayukta se baat kar kaha he ki vah mazdooron ko jald se jald bharat bhejne kaa intjaam karen
 This is in 1984, when a 22-year-old girl stepped into the Supreme Court in the city of Delhi on the first day
 uski najar radha ramaswami or kamini jaiswal par padi, jo us jamaane kii nami vakil thim
 Seeing them, the girl thought that one day i will become a big lawyer like her
 is ghatana ko 29 saal biit chuke hai or aaj vah na sirf supreme court kii nami vakil hai balki un paanch khaas mahilaon main se bhi ek hai, jinhen supreme court ne ‘‘senior edwocket’’ ke khaas ohade se nawaja he
 His name is Meenakshi Arora
 pichley 63 saal main 300 se zyada purush vakeelon ko janvari 1950 main sthapana ke baad se supreme court ke senior edwocket kaa khitaab mil chukaa he, lekin inamen mahilaon kii sankhya sirf paanch he
 In 1977, Leela Seth, the mother and advocate of noted writer Vikram Seth, got the title for the first time
 uske 30 saal baad 2007 main edwocket indu malhotra ko yah sammaan mila or ab chah saal baad pehali baar supreme court ne ek saath teen mahilaon 52 varshiya minakshi aroda, 57 varshiya kiran suri or 47 varshiya vibha dutt makhija ko is ohade se nawaja he
 Just five women in 63 years? Meenakshi smiles a little at this question, then says, "earlier the number of women in this profession was nominal
 jab maine practice shuru kii to mahila vakeelon ko ungaliyon par gina ja saktaa tha
 Meenakshi, who belongs to a middle-class family, was born in Punjab, but a long period of childhood was spent in Assam and schooling was also there
 unhone kabhi vakil banane ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin tha
 She says, "and like people, i wanted to be a doctor
" lekin biessi ke pehle saal main hi samaj main aa gaya ki science mere bas kaa nahin he
 Then i decided to go to law
 ’’80 ke dashak main public or profeshnal jindagi main mahilaon ke liye bahut barabari kii jagah nahin thi
 Says Meenakshi, "standing in the Supreme Court, a woman lawyer arguing in front of a judge was also seen in a particular feminine image
 mahila he to sari hi pehnegi
 When i first started wearing trousers and shirts in court, people commented - 'your practice will stop before it starts
 ’’ client pant pahanane vaali mahilaon par bharosa nahin karte
 "she asks how she will run wearing a sari when running from one court to another in the morning
" or kapadon kaa mere cese se kya lenaa-dena? lekin yah kehete hue minakshi kii ankhon main chamak aa jaati he ki 2013 kii duniya bilkul alag he
 Now no one can comment on women's clothes
 57 varshiya kiran suri pichley 30 saal se sari pahanakar court ja rahi hai
 She says, "stereotyping still happens today
 agar kisi purush vakil ke document par achaar kaa masala lag jaae to vah koi mudda nahin he
 But when it comes to a woman lawyer's document, it is a joke
 ’’kiran kaa janm amritsar main hua
 His father came from Lahore at the time of Partition and settled in Delhi
 yahaan tailor kaa kaam karke unhone apane teenon bacchon ko padhaayaa
 Kiran has seen a lot of financial difficulties
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘agar agle din skool kii fees deni hoti thi to pita puri raat jagakar silaai karte the
 '' o a corporate professional
 pi
 After marrying Suri, Kiran started practicing in the Karnataka High Court, but a road accident that took place only a few years later nearly ended her career
 ve paanch saal tak wheel chair par raheen
 After coming to Delhi in 1989, he started practice in the Supreme Court and then went up the stairs of success
 1992 se is peshey main sakriy vibha dutt makhija dilli main hi pali-badi hai
 After studying at Delhi Public School and Lady Shri Ram College and pursuing law at Delhi University, he did his LLM from Georgetown University, Washington
 vibha kahati hai ki is profeshan main aana aasaan he, lekin tike rahanaa or aage baduya bahut mehnat or vakt kii maang karata he
 How would it be possible to take advocacy seriously with the responsibilities of marriage, children and family? Vibha says, "there is double pressure on women
 unhen kisi purush ke mukaable khud ko zyada sabit karnaa padataa he
 "all three lawyers say that there is a general perception in this profession that women lack professionalism
" aise main auraton ke liye chunauti dohari ho jaati he
 In the days when Meenakshi was making her career, her love with her German boyfriend and engineer Caseis Werner by profession was also gaining ground
 baad main shaadi bhi unke kariyar kii raah main kabhi diwaar nahin bani
 Meenakshi says, "in all these years of our marriage, till date Kesis has not even asked me for a glass of water
 agar main kichan main hum, khadi hum, to bhi vah khud uthakar lenge
 His answer is, "you're not my Made
" ’’ casis minakshi ko chaay-pani sab laakar de denge, lekin khud kabhi nahin maangate
 Meenakshi works from 9 am to 9 pm in the working days and 5-6 hours on weekends
 lekin ve apane kaam ko lekar jitani gambhir hai, utani hi chhuttiyon ko lekar bhi
 Every year she spends a month in Germany with her husband
 kiran ko pahaado se itani muhabbat he ki himachal kaa koi aisa konaa nahin he, jo unhone na dekha ho
 Five senior advocates are less in 36 years, but Meenakshi says, "this number will increase now
" hamaare saath practice shuru karne vaali aadhi se zyada mahilaayein gharelu jimmedaariyon ke kaaran laut gayi
 But today girls know that career is first and foremost

 5 Star Artist: Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, KK Menon and Karan johardirector: Anurag kashyapanurag Kashyapun is among the film directors who are heavily influenced by directors of World Cinema and Hollywood like Martin Scorshaji and Quentin Tarantino
 is baar ve apni ab tak kii sabase mahangi film lagbhag 80 karod ru
 Ki 'bombay Velvet' Laker has come
 ve film main bhavyata, 1960 ke dashak kaa bombai dikhaane main to kaamyaab rahe, par kahani ke maamle main chookte najar aae
 The film also looks like an attempt to iron out his image of realistic cinema by making it into commercial cinema, but does not provide much fun, and the entire film looks very entangled
 second half ke baad to film kii kahani taash ke patton kii tarah bikhar jaati he or lagata he ki anuraag dher saare kairactors ke makadjaal main ulajhakar rah gaye hai
 The film goes far beyond the entertainer factor
 kahani main kitna damdesh ko nai-nai aazaadee mili he
 Ranbir Kapoor comes to Bombay
 yah us daur kaa bombai he, jab aazaadee ke baad udyog se lekar aparaadh kii duniya tak har jagah kuch na kuch uthal-puthal ho rahi thi
 He has to do something big and he becomes familiar with the world of crime
 vah paisa kamaane ke liestreet fiterbanata he
 He meets Anushka and the love of the two begins to climb
 is bich karan johar jaisaa kaaiyaan shaks bhi ranbir kii jindagi main aata he jisaki apni mahatvakankshaayen hai
 The story goes on and on and the characters keep on coming, and the western effect on the entire film seems to be coddling
 yah kahin samaj nahin aa paata he ki anuraag iske jariye kahana kya chaah rahe the
 In the end, there is something left, so this is just how Mumbai used to be in that era, what were its problems and making a film in Hollywood style
 star apilaranbir kapur ne thik thaak acting kii he
 His character remains far away from understanding till the end
 johny balraj naam bhi martin scoreshiji kii film min streats main robert di nero ke johny boy se hi prerit lagata he
 As far as Anushka is concerned as a jazz singer, she is average, and all the focus is on her lips
 karan johar ko acting se tauba hi kerani chahie
 It would be better for them to stay away from such attempts in future
 vah kahin bhi kuch bhi aisa nahin kar pate jo yaad rahe
 The rest of the film's characters and stars are not even remembered
 film puri tarah se pashchim cinema ke rang main pagi najar aati he
 Talk of earnings 'bombay Velvet' is the most expensive film of Anurag so far
 karan johar jaise commercial diarector ke saath aana bhi pehali baar hua he
 But it is seen far away from the ground and is very weak in terms of story
 mujeec bhi bahut laud he or aisi ummid nahin kii ja sakati ki yah film 'gangs of vasepur' jaisi unki film se aage nikal paaegi
 The first half of the film is fine, but the second half feels breathless, and the plot feels very drawn
 film anuraag ke phans ko acchhee lag sakati he, lekin aisa kuch bhi nahin jo ise yaadgaar banaae
 Anyway, Anurag's films are rarely for Hindi belt or Tier 2 or 3 cities

 rajyasabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne supreme court ke chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf vipaksh dwaara laae gaye mahabhiyog prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 The Congress party has termed this decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman as wrong
 congress party rajyasabha sabhapati ke is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main apil karegi
 On the question of differences between the Congress mps on the matter of impeachment, Sibal said that it is not a matter of the party but of mps
 samajhane vaale ise samaj rahe hai, jo na samajhe ve anaadi hai
 On this decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman, Kapil Sibal on behalf of the Congress said that this is completely wrong and illegal
 unhone kaha ki bina jaanch ke hi prastaav ko khaarij kar diya gaya, desh ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua he
 Kapil Sibal said that the matter should have been investigated first, only then a decision should have been taken
 ye faisla jo kiya gaya he ise kaaphi jaldbaaji main kiya gaya he
 Sibal said that the Rajya Sabha chairman had only to see whether the proposal was signed or not
 iske baad jaanch cameti banati he jiskaa kaam ye bataanaa he ki aarope sahi hai yaa nahin
 If the allegations are found true then it comes to the House
 unhone kaha ki sabhapati ko jo bhi salaah mili he galat salaah thi
 But the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha says that we have proved the allegations
 ab ye baat bina jaanch ke kaise sabit ho sakati he? unhone kaha ki sabhapati aise maamalon main CJI kii raay lete hai lekin isamen nahin le sakate the
 However, he could certainly take the opinion of other members of the Collegium
 bayaanbaji par lagaai thi rokapako bataa den ki isse pehle congress ne is mudde par apane netaaon se bayaanbaji karne se manaa kiya tha
 If Congress sources are to be believed, then all the leaders have been told from the party not to give a statement on this issue yet
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaghulam nabi azadako bhi is mudde par bolne se manaa kiya gaya he
 The Congress party can approach the court on this issue
 haalanki, congress kii ore se kaha ja rahaa he ki is par party ko koi jhatka nahin he, hamen isaki pehle se hi ummid thi
 Significantly, 7 opposition parties led by the Congress had presented this proposal before the Rajya Sabha Speaker, but Venkaiah Naidu rejected the proposal on Monday morning after legal advice
 venkaiya naidu ne apana faisla sunaate hue kaha ki chif justise ke khilaaf laayaa gaya ye mahabhiyog naa hi uchit he or naa hi apekshit he
 In bringing this type of proposal, every aspect should be kept in mind
 is khat par sabhi kanoonee salaah lene ke baad hi main is prastaav ko khaarij karata hum
 The impeachment party had given 5 reasons behind the impeachment motion
 kapil sibbal ne media se baat karte hue kaha tha ki nyaaypalika or lokantatr kii raksha ke liye ye jaruri tha
 1
 mukhya nyaayadhish ke pad ke anurup aacharan naa hona, prasad ajukeshan trust main phayda uthaane kaa aarope

 2

 insaani jism kaa yun to har hissaa apane aap main ahm he
 But the matter of stomach is something else
 paapi pet ke sawaal par log naa jane kya-kar guzarate hai
 But when you look into the stomach which we have been involved in today, then believe me, that stomach will be seen less box
 bas yun samaj lijie ki ek tul woox main jo-jo chijen rakhi jaati hai, ek sahab ne wo sari chajen apane pet main rakhi hui thim
 The first introduction of this sir who makes a stomach box is that he is a prison inmate
 darasal madhya pradesh ke indore main hathkadiyon main jakade madhav naam kaa ek shaks ko dekhakar pehle to koi bhi ise ilaaj ke liye aspataal laayaa gaya ek maamuli kaidi hi samajhegaa
 But this prisoner is not an ordinary prisoner but a person whose everything is present in the stomach which is not possible to be in the stomach of a human being
 cheez bole to wo chijen jinhen khaanaa yani pet ke andar pahunchaana to dur, jiske bare main sochna bhi mushkil he
 So now let us make you aware of these strange things present in this person's stomach without losing time
 ye chizein hai, scru driver yani pechkas, lohe kaa paanaa, tang clinar, shishe ke tukade, suiyaan, scru, pathar, plastic ke tukade or naa jane kya-kya
 But now the question is, when and how did these things reach this human stomach? Did this man himself deliberately deliver these things to his stomach or by some deception did these things enter his body? The question is also that with such strange things how is this person alive for so long? And what is going to happen with this person now? Of course, the answer to every question is very disturbing
 darasal, madhya pradesh kii police madhav naam ke shaks ko indore ke nazadik alirajpur naam kii ek jagah se lekar pahunchi
 Murder means murder on this person
 lekin madhav kii maane to ye qatl kaa ye iljaam hi uske pet main in ajeebogareeb chizon ke pahunchane kii sabase badi vajah he
 According to Madhav, a few years ago today, Dhar police suddenly arrested him
 giraftaar ke baad sabase pehle use thane lekar jaaya gaya or vahaan usase rishwat ke taur par rupayon kii maang kii gai lekin chunki wo garib tha or uske paas police ko dene ke liye paise nahin the, police ne use uthaa kar sidhe jail bhej diya or bas yaheen se uski zindagi badal gai
 Till then, Madhav did not realize his coming time
 lekin kuch rose baad jab uski dobaaraa adaalat main peshi hui, to use pataa chalaa ki us par ek shaks ke katl kaa sangeen iljaam he, to bas isi roj se uskaa dimaag phir gaya
 Now call it Madhav's anger against oppression or the craze of harming himself, Madhav started eating everything he could get his hands on, whether it was a screwdriver, a piece of iron, a tung cleaner, a blade or anything else
 vaise doctoron ke mutabik ab is oparation ke baad madhav par koi khatara nahin he
 But even after being in jail, Madhav, who has been eating iron for a long time, raises many questions in himself
 sawaal ye ki kya vaaki madhav bekusur he? or jhuthe mukademe kaa sadma bardaasht nahin kar paane kii vajah se pagal ho gaya he? agar haa, to wo jail main kyon band he? mukademe kaa faisalaa to kair adaalat ko karnaa he lekin jail kii jagah madhav kii sahi jagah yakeenan maansik rogiyon kaa aspataal he
 In the same way, where do these things get Madhav so easily in jail? So far, while clearing hands on these things, why did no one notice Madhav? And if people saw Madhav eating all these things in jail, then why was he not brought to the hospital already? Obviously, the answer to these questions has to be given to the Madhya Pradesh Police and Alirajpur Jail Administration

 India's legendary wicket-keeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni has put an end to all the speculation about his retirement and not going on the West Indies tour
 38 varshiya dhoni ne bisisiai ko suchit kiya he ki vah philhal do maheene kisi bhi tarah kii cricket ke liye anuplabdh rahenge
 Dhoni is joining the Para Military Regiment for the next 2 months
 isse yah saaf hota he ki dhoni team india ke saath westeindies daure par nahin jaaenge
 Let us know that Team India will start the West Indies tour from August 3
 bharat ko is dauraan teen tii-20 international, teen vanade or do test match khilne hai
 Team India will be selected for the West Indies tour tomorrow or Sunday
 dhoni ne BCCI ko di jaankaribisisiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘dhoni ne yah kaha he ki ve westeindies daure par nahin ja paaenge
 He would spend time in the Paramilitary Regiment for the next two months
 unhone ravivaar ko hone vaali chayansmiti kii baithak se pehle yah faisla liya
 He also informed captain Virat Kohli and MSK Prasad
 ’adhikari ne kaha ki dhoni ke is bayaan se ummid jataai ja sakati he ki ve abhi sanyas ke bare main nahin soch rahe
 On Sunday, the selection committee headed by MSK Prasad will meet in Mumbai, in which the Indian team will be selected for the tour of West Indies
 haalanki dhoni ne sanyas kaa elaan nahin kiya he, lekin vah 2 maheene koi cricket nahin khelenge
 Earlier it was being speculated that Dhoni will retire from cricket after the World Cup
 isse pehle dhoni ke sanyas kii khabaron par unke manager or dost arun pandey ne bayaan diya tha
 Arun Pandey had said that Dhoni has no intention of retiring yet
 arun pandey ne kaha ki abhi maahi ke cricket chhodane kaa koi plan nahin he
 Let me tell you that speculation started on Dhoni's retirement after the team's World Cup journey in the World Cup stopped in the semi-finals
 arun pandey se pehle dhoni ke bachapan ke coach keshav banerjee ne kaha tha ki vah tii-20 world cap tak khelnaa jari rakh sakate hai
 Dhoni's childhood coach had said that i believe Mahi should play in T20 format
 50 over kii wicketcaping or phir ballebaaji ke saath vanade khelnaa sharir ke liye bahut kathin hota he
 Then he is always in action on the field due to the added pressure of helping bowlers and fielders
 jabaki tii-20 main unhen itani jaddojahad nahin kerani padegi
 There has been no official statement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Dhoni's retirement so far
 lekin keshav banerjee kaa maananaa he ki is bare main jald hi faisla liya janaa chahie
 Let us know that Dhoni has been constantly under the target of critics for his performance in the World Cup-2019
 aath maichon main unhone 273 ran banaae, jo kisi bhi bhartiya madhyakram ke ballebaajon dwaara sabase adhik he
 Hardik Pandya (226) and Rishabh Pant (116) are behind them in this list
 akhirpara sainya regiment se kyon judenge dhoni?bhartiya team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ko cricket main unki uplabdhiyon ke kaaran 2011 main pradeshik sena main maanad leftinent karnal kii rank di gai thi
 Dhoni is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honor
 dhoni ko maanad kamishan diya gaya kyonki vah ek youth iken hai or vah yuvaaon ko sashastr balon main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 In November 2011, Dhoni was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army (TA)
 tab unhone kaha tha ki vah sena main adhikari bananaa chaahate the, lekin kismat ne unhen cricketer bana diya
 Also read- Dhoni obeyed ICC, Uddhoni became a trained paratrooper in 2015 by wearing gloves without 'sacrifice badge' Mahendra Singh Dhoni became a trained paratrooper in August 2015
 agra ke paratrupers training skool (pities) main bhartiya vaayu sena ke een-32 vimaan se paanchavin chalaang puri karne ke baad unhone pratishthit para wings pratik chihn (para Wings insignia) lagane kii arhata praapt kar lee thi
 It is notable that Dhoni then jumped from a height of 1,250 feet and successfully landed near the Malpura dropping zone in less than a minute

 ab do baar asafal hone ke baad company ne philhal is ap ko rilonch karne kaa iraadaa chhod diya he

 da print kii ek report ke mutabik, aditi camel kaa saath chhodane ke baad patanjali ne noida besd ap mekking form soshal revolution media and research privet limited ke saath saajhedaari kii thi
 Let us tell you, the idea of patanjali launching a messaging platform was Aditi Kamal's own
 may or agast main kimbho ap ko do baar launch kiya gaya
 But both launches were unsuccessful as they were not liked by security experts
 iske baad company ne philhal ke liye ap ko phir se launch karne kaa iraadaa chhod diya he
 Acharya Balakrishna, CEO and Managing Director of Patanjali Ayurveda told the publication that we wanted to launch a mature and highly secure app in a technical way
 haalanki abhi ham kiye gaye kaam se santusht nahin hai
 We have currently given up the idea of launching the app because we do not want to launch half-finished products in the market
 unhone aage kaha ki vartmaan main, ham nae projects ke saath kaaphi vyast hai or mujhe nahin lagata he ki hamaare paas kimbho main aage lagane ke liye samay or sansaadhan hai
 For the time being we have put this project side by side and no date has been set for its relaunch
 patanjali kimbho ap kii branding 'swadeshi chat ap' ke rup main kii gai thi
 Which can replace Facebook-owned whatsapp in India
 is ap ko sabase pehle 30 may ko launch kiya gaya tha
 However, due to poor security features, it was removed from the Google Play Store within 24 hours
 iske baad is ap ke trial varjan ko 27 agast ke aadhikarik launch se pehle and-tu-and encripshan ke saath 15 agast ko dobaaraa launch kiya gaya
 But when many users reported the problems coming then it was removed from the Google Play store due to security reasons before the official launch and the launch was postponed

 com / sa8dvuiojc— ANI (@ani_news)april 21, 2016 On Friday, the Supreme Court reserved its decision in the Rafale Aircraft Deal Case
 sarkaar kii daleelon par is maamle ke yachikakarta or vakil prashanth bhushan 2 hafte main likhit daleel denge
 a review petition has been filed against the Supreme Court's decision in December 2018 in this case, which was heard on Friday
 yachikakartaon main prashanth bhushan ke alaava yashavanth sinha, arun shouri or sanjay singh shaamil hai
 Prashant Kishore, Prashant Bhushan, argued before the court and argued
 bhushan ne kaha, faisle kii samiksha kaa aadhaar ye he ki disambar 2018 kaa jajment isi par aage bad rahaa tha ki yachikakarta saude ko radd karne kii maang kar rahe the, jabaki humlog lalita kumari jajment ke aadhaar par saude kii jaanch or exiaar darj karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 The review is also needed because there are many errors in the Judgment due to misinformation given by the Government
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar ne khud is maamle main karection aplication daayar kiya he
 Prashant Bhushan asked during the cross-examination, 'how did the government know that some parts would be added later in the CAG report? How did the government come to know in November 2018 that the CAG would add a part of the prices to the 2019 report? Bhushan said, "why the Anti Corruption Clause was removed in the deal
 is bare main sarkaar jawaab nahin de pai he
 This issue alone is a sufficient basis for passing judgment
 is saude main na to koi bank guarantee lee gai or na hi koi soweran guarantee
 The supply of Rafale aircraft is delayed, while earlier it was said that the supply of 36 aircraft will be soon
 'prashanth bhushan ne sarkaar ke is daawey par bhi sawaal uthaaya ki pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) is saude par keval najar rakhe hue tha na ki piemo kisi samanaantar saudebaaji main shaamil tha
 Bhushan said that the National Security Advisor (NSA) also had a role in it
 saude main kai aisi baaten hai jisase tay hota he ki piemo najar rakhane se zyada kuch kar rahaa tha jisaki puri jaanch honi chahie
 Prashant Bhushan said in his plea, 'anil Ambani and French defense officials were meeting when the Prime Minister announced the deal
 lagbhag usee vakt anil ambani ko france sarkaar kii ore se tex main bahut badi chhot mili
 What Arun Shourie said Arun Shourie started the cross-examination of false testimony
 shouri ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki sabhi dastavej kaig ko die ja sakate hai to court ko dene main kya dikkat he? jajment main har ek truti ke liye sarkaar kii ore se di gai galat jaankaree jimmevaar he
 You have expressed confidence in the (court) government, but the government has broken this trust
 arun shouri ne jajment main or bhi trutiyon kii ore ishaara kiya or kaha ki ye accidental nahin he
 Shourie said, you (the court) gave a statement based on the government note but the government broke your trust
 atorni general keke venugopal kii daliftorni general ne sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 He said, 'some basics have been raised by the petitioners
 un baton main kuch anya pahalu jodakar mudde ko tool diya gaya he
 As far as the prices of the aircraft are concerned, it has been decided under Section 10 of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
 ijie ke tahat keemten nahin bataai ja saktin
 The court has also not asked for the prices, but has sought information about the procedure
 hamane projisar ke bare main bataa diya he
 Even if there is an error, it does not form the basis for reviewing the deal
 'venugopal ne kaha, 've (yachikakarta) saude par sawaal uthaanaa chaah rahe hai jo desh ke logon kii suraksha ko prabhavit karata he
 Rafael aircraft are not for decoration
 ye harek vyakti kii suraksha ke liye nihaayat jaruri he
 Nowhere in the world is such a case brought to court
 'CJI or justise keem joseph ke sawalvenugopal kii baat sunakar justise keem joseph ne transfar of technology ke bare main poocha
 He told the Attorney General, who decides this, can this court decide on this? CJI Ranjan Gogoi questioned about the Sovereign Guarantee
 atorni general ne iske jawaab main rus or america ke saath hue raksha saudon kaa hawala diya jisamen bank guarantee se bharat ko chhot di gai he
 Justice Joseph sought information about the domain expert's dissent note (according to Prashant Bhushan, three defense experts from the International Negotiating Team had issued a dissent note taking objections regarding Rafale's pricing)
 justise joseph ke is sawaal par venugopal ne kaha, teen raksha visheshgyon ne jo mudde uthaae hai use dephence equijishan cameti ko refer kar diya gaya he
 Eventually all three experts agreed
 joseph ne poocha, teenon visheshgyon kii sahmati court main pesh karne main aapako koi aapatti he? nyaayik simaaon kaa hawala dete hue etorni general ne kaha, aapako (court) isamen nahin janaa chahie lekin iske baavjood aap chaahate hai to main aisa karuunga
 After hearing all these arguments, the Supreme Court reserved its decision on the review petition of the Rafale deal

 Anyway, the other parties are doing the same thing

 Jaihind clearly stated that his program was authorized by the party, while Yogendra Yadav would have called a private meeting
 ishaara saaf he
 The campaign to shore up the office bearers of Yogendra Yadav and the state unit under his influence has intensified
 yogendra yadav ne 14 april ko gudgaanv main apane samarthakon kii baithak bulaai he, jise unka shakti pradarshan mana ja rahaa he, lekin kejariwal gut ko yah raas nahin aa rahaa
 Aam Aadmi Party's chief spokesperson Ashutosh also said that for what purpose the meeting has been convened on the 14th should be disclosed
 isse pehle bhi, 15 farvari ko jab yogendra yadav ne chandigarh main pradesh kaaryakarini kii baithak rakhi thi to naveen jaihind ne rohtak main kaaryakartaaon kii samanaantar meeting yojit kii thi

 BJP MLA from Lalitpur Sadar in Uttar Pradesh fell victim to cyber robbers
 bijepi vidhayak ramratan kushvaha ne anjaane kol par apana acount number or OTP share kiya or 5 hajaar ganvaa baithe
 By becoming a mobile parabank officer of Sadar MLA Ramratan Kushwaha from Lalitpur district BJP, the thug first asked for his ATM number and also asked for the OTP number that came on his mobile number
 vidhayak ji ko pataa bhi nahin chalaa ki ye phone kisi thag kaa he or unke khate se 5 hajaar rupee uda liye
 After that, as soon as the MLA Ramratan Kushwaha got the call of the same thug again on the mobile, he wanted to ask for the OTP number for the second time
 jiske baad unhen kuch shaq hua or apane acount se 5 hajaar rupee nikaal lene kii baat kahkar unhone duusari baar OTP number dene se manaa kar diya
 It is a matter of satisfaction that the MLA did not fall prey to greatness
 vidhayak ramratan kushvaha ne isaki shikaayat sadar kotwali police se kii he
 It is worth noting that the government and RBI have been constantly issuing warnings about fake calls that details of their bank account should not be given to anyone on such phone calls, but in spite of this, when the BJP MLA with a degree of advocacy can become a victim of their fraud
 If it is illiterate, the condition of the uneducated people can be understood by itself
 thagi kaa shikaar ban chuke vidhayak ne ab logon se apil kii he ki wo apnicount numberkisi se share na karen or thagi se bachein

 desh kii sabase hai profile siton main se ek pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main raajnneetik paara kaaphi chadh gaya he
 After the road show of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Wednesday, the leaders of the grand alliance will campaign today
 varanasi main aaj mahagathbandhan ke teenon bade netaa mayawati, akhilesh yadav or areldi ke pramukh netaa choudhary ajit singh sant ravidaas mandir ke sant samagam sthal par chunavi raily karenge
 The special thing is that after the nomination of former BSF jawan Tej Bahadur from here, the Samajwadi Party has made Shalini Yadav Yadav its candidate
 mahagathbandhan ke teenon netaa bijepi or modi virdohi tamaam logon ko mahagathbandhan ke paksh main laane kii koshish karenge
 If you look at the caste equation in Varanasi, then there are maximum number of Vaishya community voters
 iske baad yahaan sabase zyada muslim voters he
 Opposition preparations to surround Modi: a day before on Wednesday, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi did a road show here
 priyanka gandhi ke is 6 kilometre lambey road sho main congress samarthakon kii baari bheed juty thi or unke road sho kaa ilaaka bhi kareeb-kareeb vahi tha jahaan piem modi ne road sho kiya tha
 The Congress has once again placed a bet on Ajay Rai to challenge PM Modi
 ajay raay 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi se baari maton se chunaav haar gaye the
 The mahagathbandhan-congress can divide the vote between the candidates
 While the opposition parties like Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and RLD are busy in encircling the BJP and Modi in UP, the election experts believe that the Congress and the Grand Alliance have two candidates
 Due to this, anti-modi votes can be divided among them
 raajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik is baar muslim matadaata mahagathbandhan kii jagah congress kii taraf ja sakate hai
 The biggest reason for this is that there is no strong candidate to be considered against Modi
 tejbahadur ke chunavi ran se baahar hone ke baad muslimon kaa ekamusth vot kisi bhi vipakshi dal ko kam hi milane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 On the other hand, Bhumihar voters are also expected to be divided
 zyaadaatar bhoomihaar congress ummidavaar ajay raay ke saath ja sakate hai
 According to experts, Ajay Rai can also benefit from being local
 haalanki piem modi kii lokapriyata ko dekhte hue congress ummidavaar ajay raay piem modi ko sidhi takkar dete hue najar nahin aa rahe hai
 If you look at the caste equation of Varanasi, then how many voters of Varanasi are the most global community voters there
 inaki sankhya kareeb saadhe teen lakh he
 There is also an equal number of OBC voters there
 iske baad muslim matadaata vahaan sabase zyada he jinaki sankhya kareeb 3 lakh he
 There is also a good number of Brahmin voters in Varanasi and according to the figures there are about 2
5 lakh Brahmin voters there
 jabaki dedh lakh bhoomihaar, 2 lakh patel samudaay ke voters, 1 lakh 20 hajaar ke aasapaas dalit voters or ek lakh ke kareeb rajput voters kii sankhya he
 Let me tell you that Ajay Rai was first in BJP and contested the assembly elections in 1996 from Koilsa
 unhone vahaan 9 baar ke sipiai vidhayak udal ko 484 voton se maat dekar jeet darj kii thi
 Concerned over the ever increasing price of onions, the Delhi government is considering opening a sales center in place to provide onion at a reasonable price

 Some people refuse to change jobs in the event of not feeling in jobs, not learning anything new, getting less salary, not getting work according to their mood
 bahut se log to is ahm mode par kariyar change karne kii hi soch lete hai
 Do think here that you want to change jobs or career
 kya nai job main aapaki samasyaayein hal ho jaaengi? or agar aapane vaaki kariyar badalane kaa opshan chunaa he to yah ek bada kadam he
 Before finalizing anything, please consider the following points
 - kariyar change karne se pehle yah jarur sochen kaa aap kya karnaa chaahate hai? apane tallent kaa moolyankan karen
 Think of the work that you can do even without payment
 bhed-chaal na chalem
 Also think, is the market ready to adopt the field you are thinking of going? You have to know what are the needs of the new field and its managers
 yah sab jaanane ke baad hi faisla len
 See also whether your personality, skill, ability and experience in the new field will be respected or not
 vah nae kariyar par feet baithti hai yaa nahin
 The comments - aapaki skills puri tarah se nae kariyar ke mutabik nahin ho sakati
 But it is possible that they can be transferred to a new career
 unka istemaal nae kariyar main kiya ja sake
 For example, if you have worked in banking industry and now you want to work in accounts, then your skills of playing with numbers will definitely work for the new employer
 - nae field se judi companiyon ke bare main research karen
 What are the most important problems of that company and industry, can you solve them? Do you have the skills, knowledge and experience to join those companies? - kariyar change karne se pehle yah jarur sochen kaa aap kya karnaa chaahate hai? apane tallent kaa moolyankan karen

 Take the decision only after knowing all this
 - yah bhi dekh len ki kya nae kshetra main aapaki persenality, skill, yogyata va anubhav kaa sammaan kiya jayega yaa nahin
 Whether or not she fits on a new career
 tippaniyan - Your skills may not correspond to a completely new career
 lekin aisi jarur ho sakati hai ki unka transfar nae kariyar main kiya ja sake
 They can be used in new careers
 jaise agar aapane banking industry main kaam kiya he or ab aap acounts main kaam karnaa chaahate hai to numberon se khilne kii aapaki skills nae niyokta ke jarur kaam aegi
 - Research companies related to the new field
 us company va industry kii sabase pramukh samasyaayein kya hai, kya aap unhen hal kar sakate hai? kya aapmen un companiyon se judane kii skills, nolej or anubhav he

 Top officials of the angry group, who broke ties with the BCCI, discussed all the issues responsible for the differences and there have been indications that a solution has been found for the matter
 donon paksh is mudde par somvaar ko bisisiai kii kaary samiti kii chennai main hone vaali baithak main aage kii charchaa par raji ho gaye hai lekin yah khulaasa nahin kiya ki ravivaar ko hui ahm baithak kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 It is learned that the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere and both the parties have moved forward in the direction of resolving the deadlock
 matbhedon ke kaaran hi sahaara samooh bhartiya cricket team ke praayojan se hat gaya tha jabaki ipel frenchiji pune varirs kaa malikana haq bhi chhod diya tha
 The joint statement issued after the meeting said, "sahara and BCCI met and discussed all the pending issues and it was agreed that the issue would be discussed further in the meeting of the BCCI Working Committee
 ’bayaan ke mutabik, ‘baatcheet main ipel sahit bhartiya cricket ke hiton par dhyaan kendrit tha
 In the meeting that lasted about one and a half hours, the Sahara Group was led by its head Subrata Roy, while on behalf of the BCCI, its chairman n Srinivasan, secretary Sanjay Jagdale, treasurer Ajay Shirke and IPL chief Rajiv Shukla were present
 ek sheersh sutara ne kaha ki baithak main liye gaye kuch faislon ko chennai main kaary samiti kii baithak ke dauraan sweekruti di jaaegi
 The source said, 'some decisions need to be approved by the Working Committee, so they were not announced
 ’ pataa chalaa he ki anya frenchygiyon se yuva khilaadiyon ko rin par lene ke sahaara ke aagrah par anya tiimon or sambandhit pakshon se charchaa ke baad vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Under the agreement formula, the BCCI has shown greater flexibility in resolving some genuine grievances but urged Sahara to continue sponsoring the Indian cricket team till its contract is over
 gyaarah saal se bhi adhik samay tak bhartiya team ke praayojak rahe sahaara ne chaar farvari ko bisisiai se alag hone kaa faisla karte hue shikaayat kii thi ki board ne khilaadiyon or ipel maichon se sambandhit uski vaastavik shikayaton par vichaar nahin kiya
 a few hours before the IPL auction started in Bangalore, it was decided to break away from the BCCI
 sahaara ne bisisiai ke saath ek july 2010 ko nayaa praayojan anubandh kiya tha jo 31 disambar 2013 tak prabhavi he or iske tahat use prayek test, ekadivasiy or antarrashtriya twanti20 match ke liye board ko teen karod 34 lakh rupee dene he
 The agreement is believed to be worth Rs 532 crore
 sahaara pichley saal ipel se judaa tha jab usne pune frenchiji ko 1702 karod main kharida tha or is tarah yah team is twanti20 pratiyogita kii sabase mahangi frenchiji bani thi
 If no solution is found then the BCCI could suffer a loss of around 2000 crores
 board haalanki koi or praayojak dhundhakar is nuksaan kii bharpai kar saktaa he
 The reason for the differences between the two sides was to seek an alternative to Sahara Kayuvraj Singh, who is undergoing treatment for pulmonary lung in the US
 frenchiji chaahati thi kiyuvarajka 18 lakh dollars kaa vetan unke 16 lakh dollars kii nilaamee raashi main shaamil ho jaae
 The team initially had $ 2 million for the auction but spent four million dollars on keeping Sourav Ganguly with them
 bisisiai ne sahaara ke aagrah ko maanane se inkaar kar diya or ganguli ko yuvaraj kaa vikalp bhi nahin mana jisase ki team 20 lakh dollars kii puri nilaamee raashi ke saath utar sake
 Another issue was that Sahara bought the team after taking into consideration 94 matches, whereas last year, only 74 matches were played in the tournament
 sahaara kam hue maichon kii raashi waapas chahta tha

 There was a lot of uproar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as 'sad and undesirable'
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko gherne ke liye congress ne bada daanv chalate hue party ke purv pradesh adhyaksh or saansad arun yadav ko budhani se tikat diya he
 On being given the ticket at the last minute, Arun says that after intense thinking, the party has selected him and will also win
 arun yadav rajya ke purv upmukhyamantri aurcongresske kaddavar netaa rahe subhash yadav ke bade bete hai
 Subhash Yadav was the MLA from Kasrawad on a Congress ticket from 1993 to 2008
 arun kabhi vidhansabha ke sadsy nahin rahe, lekin do baar loksabhaa kaa chunaav jeet chuke hai or manmohan singh sarkaar main mantri bhi rahe
 Chief Minister Shivraj, who was in the electoral fray for the fifth time from Budhni seat from Budhni, defeated Congress candidate Mahendra Singh Chauhan in 2013 by nearly 84 thousand votes
 vah is baar bhi jeet ko lekar aashwast hai
 Today, just before the nomination, Arun Yadav, who is going to beat the Chief Minister against the Chief Minister, claimed that he will definitely win from here
 mukhyamantri shivarajke khilaaf congress kii ore se ummidavaar tay kiye jane par hui deree par arun yadav ne kaha, 'keval budhani nahin kai anya siton par guuruuvaar raat ko hi faisla liya gaya he
 The party ponders deeply to decide the most vigilant and powerful candidate, then the party decides the candidate
 party ne ab mujhe budhani se mauka diya he jo mere liye garv kii baat he
 On the selection of Hisabkhud from Shivraj, Arun Yadav said, 'I have been chosen by Rahul ji (rahul Gandhi)
 ham budhani jaaenge or jeet kar aaenge
 There is definitely talk at every point in the party
 phir nirnay hota he
 i must have been considered eligible for Budhni, so i was given a ticket
 ab main vahaan ja rahaa hum
 Will contest there and win
 'rajya diggaj netaa or mukhyamantri shivaraj ko chunauti dene ke bare main unhone kaha, 'sabase bada mudda jo he wo he maa narmada ke anchal ko chal-chal karne kaa kaam agar kisi ne kiya he to wo mukhyamantri kaa parivaar he
 If there is a mafia or parent of sand mining in the entire state, then it is the family of the Chief Minister
 pehle to ham narmada ke kan-kan kaa hisaab mukhyamantri se lenge
 'he further said,' Then all the farmers of this state who have committed suicide in the last years and the highest number of suicides have been in Sehore district, the home area of the Chief Minister, will also take account of the Chief Minister
 rajya main mahila or bacchon ke saath jo duraachaar hue hai uskaa bhi hisaab lenge
 If anyone is the father of a scam like Vyapam, he is the Chief Minister himself, we will take the same account from him
 'apane saale ko santusht nahin kar sakehchhnshivaraj ke parivaar par gambhir aarope or unkesaale sanjay sinhako hi congress kii ore se tikat die jane par arun yadav ne kaha ki mukhyamantri apane saale ko santusht nahin kar sake or wo unase dukhi hokar hamaari party main shaamil ho gaye
 What can be bigger for us than this? He subscribed to the Congress and was given a chance to fight Varasivani as he wished
 namakan main party netaaon ke shaamil hone ke sawaal par unhone kaha, 'sab logon ko alag-alag jimmedaari di gai he
 Today is the last day of nomination
 digvijay singh rajgad main hai jabaki kamalnath ko chhindwara or ajay singh ko vindhyas kosal kii jimmedaari di gai he
 They will enroll our candidates there
 suresh pachori khud chunaav lard rahe hai or wo apane aas-paas ke ummidavaaron ke saath rahenge

 ' notebandi ke baad se hi bainkon or atim ke baahar lagi lambii linon se logon ko nijaat dilaane ke liye sarkaar cashles tranjection ko badhaava dene main juty he
 Due to which Paytm and Debit, credit card payments and purchases have increased a lot
 aise main sibar aparaadhon main badhottaree hone kii ashanka he
 In view of this, it has been decided to upgrade cyber units in all the police stations of Delhi
 dilli police ke pravaktaa or sanyukt ayukta deependra pathak ne bataaya ki thane main tainaat kiye jane vaale sibar police karmiyon ko bakaayad training di gai he, taaki wo sibar krime se judi shikayaton ko samaj saken or exiaar darj kar karrwai kar saken
 Joint Commissioner Dipendra Pathak says that till now major complaints of cybercrime were heard only in cyber cell, but now people of cybercrime unit will be present in harathan
 isse sibar aparaadhon kaa jald nipataara ho sakegaa
 After demonetisation, cashless transactions are being emphasized by the government and banks
 lekin uskaa said effect bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The number of people cheated during the use of netbanking is increasing day by day

 Smoking cigarettes can be fatal
 ek ore jahaan isaki lat bahut jaldi lag jaati he vahiin ise chhodana utana hi mushkil hota he
 It starts with sitting with friends, smoking one or two cigarettes but gradually it becomes an addiction
 kuch saalon tak yaa kuch samay tak cigarette pine ke nuksaan bhale hi najar nahin aate hon lekin ek samay ke baad iskaa bura prabhaav sharir par saaf najar aane lagata he
 After that, humans eat vows on many occasions, promising that now they will not even touch cigarettes but this is not so easy
 cigarette kii lat chhudaane ke liye kai orgenigeshan kaam kar rahe hai par agar aap chahen tokhud ke liye thodaa samay nikaalkarkhud bhi is buree lat ko chhod sakate hai
 By adopting these remedies, you can overcome this bad addiction: 1
 subah uthakar tahalne se puure sharir kii eksrasij ho jaati he joki cigarette pine kii talab ko kam karne main madadgaar he
 2
 jogging karnaa bhi phydemandsabit hoga
 3
 swimming karnaa bhi ek kargar upaay he
 4
 agar aap vaaki cigarette chhodana chaahate hai to yoga apanaaen
 5
 cycle chalaanaa bhi ek behad kargar upaay he
 6
 agar aap vaaki cigarette chhodana chaahate hai to koi dance class jwine kar le
 7
 parivaar ke saath vakt bitaayen

 purvi dilli kaa jayja lene par pataa chalaa ki ilaake ke zyaadaatar atm yaa to kharaab hai yaa phir unamem cash hi nahin he
 East Delhi is the area in the capital where the situation is worst after demonetisation
 atm main paise aane par yahaan lambii-lambii kataren lag jaati hai jinamein sabhi ko paisa mil jaae isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 You can guess when the situation in the capital Delhi is so bad, what will happen to the remote village-countryside

 From the elderly to the blind cash was seen standing in lines, but despite spending hours in lines, the cash could not be handed

 Hundreds of people are sitting outside the bank just waiting that somehow some cash will be found

 lagbhag puraa upie saath khadaa nazar aa rahaa tha
 Pranab da has support of JDU but no one from this party was present there

 unke saath laalkrishna adwani, nitin gadakari, vasundhara raaje party ke bade netaa to the, khaas rahaa mukhyamantriyon kaa jamaavada
 Naveen Patnaik, Prakash Singh Badal, Manohar Parikar, Shivraj Singh Chauhan etc
 in do lamho kii tasviir aage aane vaale 2014 ke samikarnon kii raah ke sanket dikhaa rahi thi
 Nitish has taken a package of twenty thousand crores from the government but by not sending anyone here, both the paths are keeping open
 naveen patnayak to yahaan maujuud the lekin unke jehan main pyaremohan mahopatra kii baghawat yaad hogi
 The NDA is also understanding that when Sangma's son Konrad went to Orissa, some important mlas did not reach there
 aaj congress ke chhattisgarh se netaa aravind netaam sangama ke saath nazar aaye to congress ne unhen nilambit kar diya
 Now the assessment of cross voting will be done in both the camps
 khaas ye bhi rahaa ki aaj sangama ji ne ’adivasee’ ke naam par vot to maange hi saath hi congress ko jam kar chetavanee de daali
 Sangma said that the Congress will have to bear the brunt of not supporting the tribals who have supported the Congress for a long time
 voton kii ginati pranab mukherjee ke paksh main ja rahi he lekin uttar purv ke bade netaa ko saath laa kar bijepi ne 2014 kii taiyaari majboot kar lee he
 This is the area where bjp's hold is weak
 ye saaf he ki is baar kaa raashtrapati chunaav behad dilachasp dikh rahaa he
 Politics dominates
 vichaardhaaraon ko kinare rakh raajnneetik avasarwaad dikh rahaa he
 Somewhere the personality is important and the equation somewhere
 ab intjaar he to bas 19 july kaa
 There are many types of things going on in the mind of both the boy or the girl on the first date
 pehali baar kisi se milane janaa apane aap main hi ek khaas ehsaas hota he
 Before going on a date, both boys and girls have many things going on in their minds
 donon us khaas shaks ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten sochate hai, kya baaten karenge, kaise milenge, kya order karenge, kaise nazren milengi or aise hi dheron sawaal donon ke man main chalate rahete hai
 But both of these also keep haunting the fear that if the front does not like anything in it
 
 
 ? yah ek aisa sawaal he jise lekar ladkaa or ladki donon hi thodaa pareshaan rahete hai
 In such a situation, everything needs to be given special attention from talk to your dress
 yah wo pehla mauka hota haijab aap donon ek-duusare ke saamne baithkar apane aage ke jivan ko tay karte hai
 This is a very special occasion and on this special occasion, your dress should be something that should be affected by seeing you in a moment
 ho saktaa he aapane apni warderob se apni sabase pasandida dress pahanane kaa faisla kiya ho lekin jaruri nahin ki vah dress saamne vaale ko bhi utani hi pasand aae
 Before choosing a dress for the first date, it is very important to take care of some special things
 unheen main se ek he aapaki dress kaa rang
 You must have heard that every color has its own message
 aise main ye behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki aap jis bhi rang kaa chayan karen, vah aapaki bhaawanaaon ko usee rup main saamne vaale ko jaahir kare
 If you too are going on a first date and are stuck in this kind of trouble, then you can adopt these measures if you want: 1
 nila rang pahananaa he sabase behataranila ek aisa rang he jise mahila or purush samaan rup se pasand karte hai
 According to a study, about 33 percent of women love blue color while 57 percent of men also like this color
 yah rang suraksha kii bhaavana liye hue hota he
 This color of quality and dependence is also a symbol of mental activism
 2
 Wearing black is also a better option
 It is also a better option
 is rang ko rahasy se jodakar dekha jaataa he
 Black is a color that works to leave an impact on the front
 yah rang majbootee kaa pratik bhi he
 3
 har maukey ko khaas banane main kaamyaab he lahogar aapako saamne vaale kaa puraa atension chahie or aap chaahate hanki uski nazren aapse ek pal ke liye bhi na haten to laal rang pahanakar janaa aapke liye sabase acha rahegaa
 Red is the color of curiosity, drama, rapture, strength and positivity
 par dress kaa rang chunane ke saath hi yah bhi jaruri he ki aap apane overol luk par bhi dhyaan den
 It is not that your dress looks beautiful but your overall look will spoil your beauty

 Without discussing some of the veteran leaders of Bihar, 'electoral churn' makes one feel incomplete

 lekin hameshaa aisa hota, to 'bade modi' or 'chote modi' kyon chhapate?lalu parivaar kaa vot bank to ab bhi pukhta he, lekin unke votaron main utsaah kyon nahin dikhataa? lagata he ki argedy main 'shaashvat depressant' chaaya hua he or party kii chamak teji se laut nahin paa rahi he
 However, Lalu's alliance with the Congress has flown parrots of Good Governance Babu
 modi ke khilaaf lalu jaisaa bayaan de dete hai, vaisaa sushasan babu chaahakar bhi nahin de pate
 It seems that Lalu's party is also going through financial crisis, due to which Lalu is not able to get the rallies, ceremonies or big conferences
 paise kaa 'raajnneetik swasthya' par vishesh asar padataa he
 Overall, one can say that this time the kind of atmosphere Lalu has got, the leader gets once in decades

 robinhood pappu (yadav) kahaan se chunaav ladenge, ye bihar kaa sabase bada suspence he
 He has indicated that he will fight from both Madhepura and Purnia, but he is currently playing with other parties
 dabang ateet vaale pappu abhi bhi nau lakh kaa mara hua hathi hai, jiske maidan main utarane kii ghoshnaa bhar se diggajon kii neend haraam ho gai he
 But Pappu himself could not decide where to fight if he fought
 purniya kii tulana main pappu kii sakriyata madhepura kshetra main zyada he or unhen bhi andaaj he ki kosi main bahut pani bah gaya he
 In every district, people feel that Pappu will contest from there itself
 yahaan tak ki khagadiya or arriya ke log bhi pappu kaa naam lete hai
 After his release from prison last year, he undertook the Ashirwad Yatra in almost all the districts of Kosi area and Pappu still hangs everywhere in hoardings
 log-baag kehete hai ki pappu kii chamak feeki pad gai he or shahar kaa ipies ab unase nahin darataa
 His arrival makes the election 'pappu vs others', no doubt
 lekin pappu main wo purana aatmavishvaas najar nahin aata, jaisaa unke nirdaleey saansad ban jane ke jamaane main dikhataa tha
 Now Pappu Sharifana, who has become a writer, has started making statements in style
 kya vakt badal gaya he, jisane unhen 'pappu' bana diya he?haa, log ye jarur kehete hai ki agar pappu ko argedy yaa jediu kii taraf se tikat yaa samarthan mil jaae, to uske saamne sabhi boune hai
 Pappu still has the most people who have become aggressive in the city in the name of a leader
 pappu intjaar kar rahe hai ki purniya or madhepura main chunaav kaayade se trikonatmak ho jaae, uske baad to chunaav jeetna unke liye baayen haath kaa khel he

 In our country, it is used in the form of Manje and Saddi (thread) made in the native way

 The leader of this children's team is Raj Gupta, who says that we are staging a drama and sending a message to the general public to stop the Chinese Manjha because the day is happening, if the public remains silent like this So the mind of these shopkeepers selling in black will increase in the same way as the mind of a child keeps on asking for money from his father

 jahaan ek taraf tanushri apni baat par adig hai or insaaf chaahati hai vahinana patekarne kaha he ki ve shooting khatm kar ke aane ke baad is maamle par vistaar se baat karne ko taiyaar hai
 This case is of 2008
 in sab ke bich ek video khub viral ho rahaa he jisamen naanaa patekar ne is maamle par media ke saamne safai di he
 In the video, a journalist asked her that Tanushree had said about her that Nana's touch was not normal
 is sawaal par ve kya kahana chahenge
 Nana replied - i don't remember when i touched him
 jabaki gane main unhen mujhe tach karnaa he, mujhe unhen tach nahin karnaa he
 There is no scope for it
 naanaa ne kaha mujhe lagata he ye sab galat he
 It is not right to say this about me
 maine itane varshon main sirf izzat kamai he or bura lagata he jab koi aisa kuch kahata he to
 It is better if not said
 aisi koi baat ghati hi nahin he jiskaa wo zikr kar rahi hai
 After this Nana also said that i should not say anything, the girl is younger than my daughter
 bataa den, tanushri ne naanaa patekar par shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He accuses Nana of trying to force himself on her during the shooting of the 2008 filmhorn OK Fleeze
 unhone kaha tha, ''naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii

 They are angry over the issue of government grants to English-medium schools
 goa ikai ne na sirf khud ko sangh kii konkan praant shakha se alag kar liya he balki bijepi se ladgaye ke liye nai party ke gathan kii bhi dhamkee di he
 It alleges that the BJP has withdrawn from its promises made before the 2012 elections on the issue of regional language
 weylingkar ne isse bhi zyada gambhir aarope kendriya raksha mantri or goa ke purv mukhyamantri manohar parrikar par lagaae hai
 They call them 'traitors'
 sangh or bijepi ise mahaj ek ghatana kah khaarij kar sakate hai
 But the reality is that even though the relationship between the two is still more comfortable than in Vajpayee's era, they still have many problems
 goa kii ghatana pradhanmantri narendra modi kii us tippanee ke do hafte baad hi saamne ai he jisamen unhone 80 fisadi gorakshakon ko farji or ashaanti paidaa karne vaala bataaya tha
 Praveen Togadia, the head of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, reacted strongly to this remark, and then the Sangh adopted a lax attitude on it
 togdipha ne modi ko un puraane dinon kii yaad dilaai jab unhone gorakshakon kii prashansa kii thi
 It is noteworthy that the Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the Sangh supported Modi first because he too may have felt the heat of anger in the Dalits after the Una incident in Gujarat
 par jab togdipha ne sangh netritv ke saamne isaki shikaayat kii to sangh ne palati maarthe hue '80 fisadi gorakshakon' ke bare main modi ke 'anupyukt' bayaan se khud ko alag kar liya, haalanki 'farji' gorakshakon ke bare main unke rukh ke prati samarthan jataa diya
 Finally, the Sangh leadership also had to instruct its allied organizations to refrain from publicly commenting against the Prime Minister
 sangh ke rashtriya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya kaa kahana tha, ''weylingkar ko isliye hataaya gaya kyonki unhone ek siyaasi rukh akhriyaar kar liya tha, alag party gathit karne kii dhamkee di or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko kaale jhande dikhaae
 He disbanded the discipline of the Union
 agar ve alag party bananaa chaahate hai to usase hamen koi dikkat nahin he par usase pehle unhen sangh ke daayitv se to istipha dena hi hoga
 We support his stand on the language issue but not his methods
 phir bhi yah mudda itnaa bada nahin he
 It will be resolved soon
 ''darasal, yah mudda sangh or sarkaar ke bich takaraav ke jatil muddon—vyaktigat tathaa rajnatik, donon—ko ujagar karata he
 The root of the controversy lies in a 1990 decision when the Maharashtra Gomantak Party was in power
 tab konkani or marathi madhyam ke skulon ko vishesh madad dene kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 At that time, after this decision overnight 126 English medium schools (mostly Christian institutions) were converted into Konkani medium
 yah niti 2011 tak chalati rahi
 At that time, due to an alleged bargain, the Congress government of Digambar Kamat helped English medium schools in this policy
 natijatan, tatkaal ve 126 skool phir se angreji madhyam main badal gaye
 BJP and Sangh launched a movement against it
 weylingkar iske netritvkarta the or parrikar unke mukhya sahyogi
 Wellingkar also formed the Indian Language Security Forum for this purpose
 unki maang thi ki konkani or marathi madhyam main shiksha ko badhaava dene ke liye un skulon se madad waapas le lee jaae jinhone khud ko phir se angreji madhyam main badal liya tha
 Then it became a major issue of BJP in the 2012 assembly elections
 par chunaavon main parrikar kii siyaasi hoshiyaari or sushasan ke unke abhiyaan ke chalate bijepi ko isaayiyon kaa bhi khaasaa samarthan hasil hua
 It was obvious that after coming to power, Parrikar also had to take care of his new base, so he was in a tizzy over the decision to withdraw the subsidy from English medium schools
 jald hi yah weylingkar se unke takaraav kaa mudda ban gaya
 Even after Parrikar reached the central government of Delhi, Velingkar raised this issue several times in front of the new Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar
 goa kaa masalaa koi akeli ghatana nahin he
 There is also tension between the BJP and the Sangh over the issue of appointments in several prestigious public institutions
 modi sarkaar ne sangh ke sujhaavon ko darkinar karte hue kai puraane naamon ko hi kaayam rakhaa he yaa padon ko khaali chhod diya he
 These include the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), Auroville Foundation and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 isiesasar main congress kii ore se niyukt arthshaastri sukhdev thoraat hai, jinase sangh ke netaa naakhush hai
 The position of chairman in the Auroville Foundation is equivalent to that of a Union Minister and there also Congress leader Dr

 Even Mallika Sarabhai, an outspoken critic of Modi, remains a member of the foundation's governing board

 Many of these officials are outspoken critics of the Modi government
 punia to khaas taur par sarkaar ke gale kii fans hai
 Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Lalit Kala Academy and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies are vacant in the top posts
 sangh ke kai netaaon kaa maananaa he ki uske daavedaaron yaa kam se kam kisi gaiyr-vam, gaiyr-congressi vyakti ko in sansthaanon kaa pramukh banane se sarkaar ke inkaar ke galat sanket ja rahe hai
 a senior Sangh Parivar official says, "we are making a mistake in a sustainable fight
 isse hamaare bauddhik divaaliepan kaa abhas jaataa he
 "the reason for this is that the ICSSR is particularly vulnerable to the Sangh as it is considered a source of resources to many anti-bjp think tanks
 sangh ke netaa bataate hai ki yahaan tak ki sangh kaa or kai martabaa pradhanmantri modi kaa bhi virodh karne vaale pratap bhanu mehta ke netritv vaala centre for policy research bhi uske labhaarthiyon main he
 Sangh leaders believe that giving the leadership of ICSSR to a powerful Sanghi intellectual will not only give strength to Sangh's research institutes but also to institutions with 'nationalist' leanings
 sangh main kuch log yah bhi maanate hai ki sarkaar ke liye is masale par ehtiyaat se kadam badhaane kii vajah he
 "the government is taking precaution because in many cases it has already burnt its hands by following inappropriate recommendations received from the Sangh," says a Sangh leader
 '' yakeenan, film and televijan institute of india ke nideshak pad par gajendra chouhan or neshnal institute of fishan technology ke pramukh ke pad par purv cricketer chetan chouhan kii niyukt kii kaaphi bhatrsana hui
 The appointment of senior journalist Rama Bahadur Rai, close to the Sangh as head of the Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts, was also criticized
 kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki shastreey nrutyaangna or sangh se sahanubhuti rakhane vaali sonal maansingh is pad ke liye zyada upyukt thim
 Asked about the significance of the uproar over these appointments, Vaidya reiterated his old explanation, "these are all minor issues, they will be resolved
" '' par yah tay he ki sangh or modi sarkaar ke liye rishton ko sudhaarney kii zarurat he
 At the moment, this relationship can only be said that it is being tolerated

 The BJP has finally managed to convince the Shiv Sena, which has been angry for some time now
 bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan main jo formula tay hua he uske mutabik 25 siton par bijepi or 23 siton par shivasena chunaav ladegi
 Along with this, the NDA alliance in Maharashtra includes the Union Minister Ramdas Athawale's RPI along with the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha and Vinayak Mete's Shiv Sangram Party
 agar goa kii baat kii jaae to rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar goa forward party or maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke sahyog se chal rahi he
 In the Lok Sabha elections also, this party will be with the BJP
 tamilnadu-pudducheritamilnadu main jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad sattadhari ediemke main upje sankat ko bijepi rajya kii raajnneeti main pravesh ke avasar ke taur par dekh rahi thi
 Recently BJP has formed an alliance in the state against UPA, which includes AIADMK, PMK, DMDK, NR Congress, Puthiya Tamalgam, and Puthiya Needhi Kachchi
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae to akele tamilnadu or pudducheri main endie ke kunbe main 6 dal shaamil hai
 Northeast: In the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the region of Northeast has a significant importance for BJP
 philhal loksabhaa main congress or uske ghatak dalon kaa palada baari he
 But in the last few years, the BJP has demolished Congress and Tripura strongholds
 aaj kii taarikh main purvottar ke rajyon main bijepi yaa uske samarthan se chalane vaali sarkarein satta par kabiz hai
 The North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has been formed on the lines of the NDA led by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Northeast
 haal ke samay main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko lekar assam gana parishad, pipuls party of arunachal or united democratic party ne NEDA ke alag hone kaa faisla liya
 But the relief news for the BJP is that many parties are still standing with the alliance
 bijepi ke saath gathbandhan main meghalaya main conrad sangama kii neshnal pipuls party, alam main bodoland pipuls front, sikkim democratic front, mizo neshnal front, indiinas pipuls front of tripura, manipur democratic pipuls front, ganashakti party or nesanalist democratic progressive party shaamil hai
 Kerala is the state in south India where BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have put a lot of emphasis in the last few years
 sabarimala mandir kaa mudda bhi bijepi ko madad pahunchane vaala rahaa
 Where in the name of faith and culture, the Bharatiya Janata Party is seen giving shape to its expansion
 kerala main loksabhaa kii 20 siten hai jahaan pichley chunaav main bijepi 18 siton par ladi thi lekin koi seat nahin jeet pai
 The largest ally of the BJP in Kerala is the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS)
 iske alaava kerala congress (thomas) bhi endie gathbandhan kaa hissaa he
 It is clear from these figures that where the Bharatiya Janata Party wants to make elections at the country level, Modi vs All
 to vahiin rajyon ke sameekaran ke hisaab majboot gathbandhan ke paksh main bhi he
 According to election analysts, the reason behind this is that there has been no decrease in the vote percentage of regional parties in the last elections
 jabaki yadi rashtriya dal chote dalon se gathbandhan main chunaav ladate hai to unke jeet kaa strike rate bad jaataa he

 The loose attitude of all the agencies along with the government is coming to check the number of vehicles in Delhi and checking pollution caused by it
 ab kejariwal sarkaar ke parivahan mantri kailash gahalot nedilli main badhate pradooshanko lekar ek nayaa kaaran bataaya he or kaha he ki pradooshan ke liye padosi rajya bhi jimmedaar hai, jisamen bihar kaa thermal power stesan bhi shaamil he
 During the conversation with Aaj Tak, the Transport Minister was seen to be the reason for the pollution spreading from the neighboring states of Delhi
 kailash gahalot ne kaha ki 'satellite kii tasviir ke mutabik puraa north india smog kii jakad main he
 Vehicles cause 20% pollution, but the major reason for pollution is the thermal power stations in the state like Bihar besides the neighboring states which need to be controlled
 'dilli main 4 pahiyaa vaahanon kii sankhya 60 lakh se zyada he
 Most of these vehicles are such that openly pollute the roads, but there is no specific plan for the government to curb these vehicles
 philhal, sawaalon se ghiri aam aadmi party sarkaar ke parivahan mantri kailash gahalot khud bataa rahe hai ki dilli main ek karod vaahan hai or in vaahanon kaa pradooshan control na hone ke baavjood ye sadakon par chal rahe hai
 According to Gehlot, the government is making a plan so that such vehicles are removed from the road

 Only Ashok Vajpayee can write this
 vah wimb or pratikon ke kavi hai
 Humanity and love are paramount to him
 videshi bhashaaon se unhone itnaa padhaa-likhaa ki vichaaron main bhi vishwa-bandhuta jhalkati he
 But even in his liberal thinking, there is no place for fundamentalism
 abhi beete saal jab vah 'sahitya ajtak' ke kaarykram main aae the to unhone kai baaten sweekaari thim
 One of them was about poetry
 unhone kaha tha, "kavita kahin se paidaa nahin hoti he
 Poetry has to be made
 ise likhane kaa ek kaushal hota he or yah siikhnaa hota he
 You learn it from the poems of others
 "sahitya ajtak: ashok vaajapeyi bole- loktantr ko abhi zyada khatrounhone jo siikhaa uski baangi 'sirf shabdon se nahin' kavita main dekhen-sirf shabdon se nahin,bina chhue use chhukar,bina chume use chuumakarbina ghere use banhon main gherkar,dur se use pankhuri-pankhuri kholte huebina dekhe use drishy karte huemaine usase kaha
 Is this superiority of expression possible without a high state of emotion? Surprisingly, a poet like Ashok Vajpayee, who is at the peak of creation, honor and fame, talks about learning at this stage of age
 seekhney kii unki yah laalasaa itani uddaam he ki 'mujhe chahie' sheershak vaali kavita main jhalak si jaati he-mujhe chahie puri prithviapani vanaspatiyon, samudronor logon se ghiri hui,ek chota-sa ghar kaafii nahin he
 The last lines of this poem are - i cannot make a poem out of a few words, i want the whole language - all the greenery of the earth, the blue sky and the red moon of the sunrise
 to ashok vaajapeyi ko kavita ke liye itnaa bada canvas chahie
 He once wrote about his writing, "when i started writing poetry, i did not expect anything except that he was messing with words
 jab kavita ko samajhane-samajhane kii koshish shuru hui jo ki kaaphi baad main hui, to yah lagane laga tha ki kavita khilwaad se zyada he
 It contains something that is not in any other combination of language
 usamen kuch aisa maanviya sampunjan bhi ho paata he jo bhashaa main anyathaa nahin ho paata
 "look at the word composition of his poem called 'rachna' - Some love, some wait, some wish that he has created, - Long before he was dead
 isi tarah unki 'vah nahin kahati' kavita ke bimb dekhie -usne kahousake paas ek chota sa hriday hajaise dhoop kaheusake paas thodi si raushnee haiaag kaheusake paas thodi si garmahat-dhoop nahin kahati uske paas antariksh haiaag nahin kahati uske paas laptenwah nahin kahati uske paas deh
 Vajpayee further wrote about the poem, "the poem sings but not because it is sometimes in the verses
 kavita yaad karti he par isliye nahin ki usamen bimbamala hoti he
 Poetry gives happiness but not because juice is its religion
 kavita prashn puuchhati he par isliye nahin ki kavi ko kisi ramajharokhe par baithkar aisa karne kaa naitik adhikaar mila hua he
 The poem deepens our mystique towards life, but not because it gets Brahm Gyan from somewhere
 kavita samaaj main hamaari hissedari ko badhaati he par isliye nahin ki vah har haalat main samaaj se patibaddh hoti he
 "ashok Vajpayee was born on 16 January 1941 in Durg
 vah iees afasar the or rajya tathaa bharat sarkaar main kaaphi bade padon par rahe, par unhone apni pahchaan ek kavi or lekhak ke rup main hi banaai

 Happy birthday to Ashok Vajpayee, an important signature of contemporary poetry from 'sahitya Aaj Tak', and this poem to his fan readers: If you can survive that little boy in everything - a man who does not plead in front of Raub, to raise his child's numbers Does not go to the master's house, who tries to leave the injured on the way to work and get to the hospital first, which happened in front of him Does not hesitate to bear witness to the witness — the same little man — who cheats but does not miss out on love, who does not force other children to wear a thig for the good fracas of his daughter, who is reluctant to add water to milk , Who thinks of the other's dry while eating his quiet, the same little man - who does not get bored of sitting near the old men who saves his house from being a storehouse of things, footbal ke mahasamar kaa aakhri tilism todane kal jab spain or holland kii timen mukaabil hongi to yah jang pairon kii kushalta ke saath kalaatmakataa kii bhi hogi jisase vishwa footbal ko ek nayaa champion milegaa

 Stopping Schneider in front of Spanish defenders will not be an easy challenge
 sarjeeo baskats or jabi alonso ne haalanki kaha he ki ve shnider ko sochane kaa bhi mauka nahin denge
 Schneider, who has won the Series A, Italian Cup and Champions League titles this year, however, refuses to value his role
 unka maananaa he ki coach kaa bharosa or team kaa lagaataar acha pradarshan hi unki jeet kii kunjee banegaa
 Schneider said, 'we will defeat Spain
 yadi khud par itnaa bharosa nahin hoga to ham kabhi haraa nahin sakenge
 This is what our coach told us

 Rawat said after Pakistani PM Imran Khan's statement on the cancellation of the Foreign Ministers' meeting, "I believe our government's policy is very clear
