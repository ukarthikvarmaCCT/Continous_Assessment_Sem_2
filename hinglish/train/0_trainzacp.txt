 jis tarah aam aadmi party ke vidhayak ne kaha ki adhikariyon ko peetna chahie, uske baad lagata he ki dilli sarkaar ab loktantr se nahin thoktantr se chal rahi he

 Here, the Chief Minister's Office has alleged that Delhi Police has reached cm's house without any notice
 mukhyamantri ghar main hi maujuud hai
 During interrogation, it is learned that a meeting was held in the drawing room of Kejriwar's house
 media se baatcheet karte hue harvinder singh ne bataaya ki ghar main 21 main 14 camaron main recording ho rahi thi, jabaki 7 band pade the
 The timing of the cameras was 40 minutes 42 seconds behind

 Usha Ramanathanaykinen These years have been in turmoil for the Supreme Court
 adalati bechaini 12 janvari, 2018 ko ek press conference main foot padi jab chaar varishthatam nyaayadhishon ne aarope lagaaya ki ''kuch samay se
 
 
 The Chief Justice of this court has been entrusting cases with far-reaching consequences to the nation and justice to the benches of his choice without any logical basis
 '' un jajon ne aarope lagaaya ki aise maamalon ko bich sunwaayee main waapas lekar pasandida nyaayadhishon kii benchon ko saunpa ja rahaa he
 In other words, four judges of the collegium were accusing the then Chief Justice of bench-fixing
 rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog ko 2015 main asanvaidhanik bataa diya gaya, or nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye sarkaar or adaalat ke bich prakriya-patr taiyaar karne kaa asaadhaaran praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 Now deadlock has come in that too
 adaalaton kaa ek anivaary daayitv he ki ve 'bahusankhyakwaad ke vipareet' rahen, or ek bahusankhyakwaadi sarkaar har mode par adaalat ke saamne chunautiyaan khadi karti rahi he
 The constitution is a document restricting the rights of the people and the powers of the state
 adaalat ne in donon hi morchon par kotahi barti he
 Delay in the judicial process is natural, but the delay and negligence in considering the drastic change in the forces of Parliament and the Executive calls into question the legitimacy of the court
 puraani kahawat he ki supreme court antim isliye nahin he ki yah achook he, lekin yah achook he kyonki yah antim he
 In the Sabarimala and Puttaswamy II (UID / Money Bill) case, a rethinking of the issues set by the Constitution Bench in almost a year has led some bitter critics to say that the Supreme Court is neither infallible nor The last
 sabarimala or teen talaak maamalon jaise pitrusattatmak prathaon ke maamle adaalat ke saamne aae, lekin adaalat main sanvaidhanik bhram kaa daur chal rahaa he jisaki jhalak sabarimala maamle ko badi peeth main bhejne main dekha ja saktaa he
 In September 2018, the trial of the case for not considering homosexuality a crime, reached its conclusion
 agast 2017 main gopneeyata maamle ke faisle main adaalat kii bahusankhyakwaad ke vipareet hone kii jimmedaari ubhar kar saamne ai thi
 In the judgment, the court said that "the guarantee of constitutional rights does not depend on the positive perception of majority for them
" '' niztaa ke adhikaar par is nirnay ke baad adaalat kaa us bindu par pahunchnaa aprihaary tha jahaan samalangikta ko aparaadh maananaa jari nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 The lawsuit involving Section 377 establishes the concept of constitutional ethics in legal language as distinct from public morality
 yah ek sambhaavnashil vichaar he jise durupyog yaa ati prayog ke kaaran marane se bachaana hoga
 In the matter of privacy, the nine judges unanimously considered privacy as a fundamental right
 uskaa prasthaan-bindu atorni general kii us daleel se judaa mana ja saktaa he ki ''is desh ke logon ko niztaa kaa adhikaar nahin he, usase jaraa bhi adhik nahin jitna sarkaar or sansad dene ko taiyaar hon
 "it had stopped our breath
" sanvaidhanik yojana main rajya ko yah daayitv diya gaya he ki vah hamaare adhikaron or swatantraaaon kii raksha kare, unka vistaar kare
 This is the reason for its existence
 aise main, atorni general kaa kisi adhikaar ke samaapan kaa daawa nishchit rup se daraavna tha
 Later in the judgment it was called the 'irrefutable natural right' necessary to protect the innate dignity and autonomy of man
 niztaa kaa maamla yuidi pariyojna ko di gai chunauti ke kram main aayaa tha or is par faisla spasht shabdon main tha ki hamaare sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko samaapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Whether we use them or not, but we always have those rights
 yuidi maamle main nyaayamurti sikri ke likhaa bahumat kaa faisla is bare main anya tareeke se vichaar karata he
 He wrote that the poor need dignity not through privacy, but through food, shelter and employment
 niztaa ke maamle kaa nirnay ise bahut alag tareeke se dekhtaa he, ''yah kahana ki garibon ko naagarik or rajnatik adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa nahin he or unki chintaaen keval aarthik kalyaan tak simit hai, aisi baat he jiskaa upyog itihaas main maanavadhikaron ke sabase dhruapurna ulalanghanon ke liye hua he
 "there are also cases in which no delay can be tolerated
" kashmir main maheenon se saikadon logon kii giraftaar or najarbandi chal rahi he, or phir bhi adaalat ne bevajaah sanyam baratate hue sarkaar ko na jane kya karne ke liye adhik se adhik samay diya he
 Similarly, there has been no change for months in the matter of dealing with the suspension of telephone and internet communication system in Kashmir, yet the court is giving it the desired time on the demand of the government
 anuchhed 370 main gadhi gai kanoonee kathaon, kisi rajya ke darje ko ghataakar centreshasit pradeshon main badal dene, jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan ko ekatarfa tareeke se samaapt kiye jane ko chunauti dene ke maamalon main sunwaayee ko sthagit karke un kaamon ko nirvivaad tareeke se puraa hone dene kii koi safai nahin di ja sakati, sivaay iske ki usne aisa karke sarkaar ke prati asaadhaaran sammaan dikhaaya he
 Such behavior towards the people and the state only motivates people to compare situations with habeas corpus during emergency in which the court justified the government saying that mass arrests, detention, even taking life The conditions are also good in which the court should remain silent and partner in such crime
 yah kitna sanvaidhanik he?rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) maamle main bhi immergency kaa saaya dikhaai de rahaa he
 It is only a script to tamper with the basic idea of citizenship and to alienate some people and to do communal politics, but the first chapter of this script has been staged in Assam, headed by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi
 jab sarkari karrwai visangatiyon or ghor ulalanghanon kii vajah bane to ham adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai
 But when the court is taking such a harmful action, where do people go? The Ayodhya case decision can provide a way to finalize a dispute, but its internal contradictions are not ending
 yah tay karne ke baad ki yah ek sampatti vivaad tha, or yah maanate hue ki ise vishwaas yaa aasthaa ke vishay ke rup main tay nahin kiya ja saktaa he, yah hinduon kii aasthaa kaa maamla kaise ban gaya?adaalat ko is baat kaa koi saboot nahin mila tha ki masjid kisi mandir ko todakar yaa uski jagah banaai gai thi
 He considered the installation of the idol of Ram in the mosque as an act of 'desecrating' the mosque and called the demolition of the mosque a criminal act
 isane sampatti ke tukade karne ko 'kanoonee rup se asthir' or 'saarvajanik shanti tathaa sadbhaav banaae rakhane kii drushti se bhi 'upyukt' nahin mana
 And, believing that the Muslims could not prove their claim, the court handed over the entire land to the Hindus
 agar yah ek samjhauta tha, to spashtat: bahusankhyakwaad ke nazariye ke vipareet samjhauta nahin tha
 If this decision is upheld and a temple is built on that land, it may be a strange and bizarre example of history that the temple will be built exactly where a mosque was demolished
 *** Recently, three of the 10 terrorists infiltrating into India from Pakistan have been killed by security agencies

 This 'women's card' may not work for you or any Olympic winner or any national award winner, but it is useful to get a pregnant woman a 'ladies' seat in a crowded bus
 yah ek mahila ko khatra mahasoos hone par rone ke taur par istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Likewise, this 'victim Card' also works for girls like my sister Rangoli, who is an acid attack Victim so that she can get justice
 ' kangana ne kaha, ' ham kisi vyakti ke khilaaf nahin balki ek soch ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 i am not fighting Karan Johar with this masculine thinking
 ' tippaniyan Karan Johar has recently become a daughter and father of a son through surrogacy
 is par kangana ne mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'ab karan johar ek choti si beti ke pita he, aise main unhen apni beti ko yah saare 'cards' dene chahie, jaise 'women card', 'victim card' or 'self-maid-independent women card'
 Or maybe the 'hard card' that i used on his show
 ' Kangana also said that she was also surprised to see why Karan did not remove that part from the show
 agar mere saath aisa kuch hota to main us channel ko blaclist kahi kar detii
 We should remember that the channel wanted TIP and Karan Johar is paid for hosting the show
 karan ne kaha tha ki agar kangana ko lagata he ki yah industry itani buree he to chhod kyon nahin deteen
 On this, Kangana also said in this interview that there is no small studio given to her by the father of Indian film industry Karan Johar at the age of 20
 vah sirf uskaa ek chota hissaa he
 This industry is made up of people like us, whose parents cannot even give them formal training for this

 Let me tell you that Kangana Ranaut had recently appeared in Karan Johar's chat show 'koffee with Karan' and in this show, Kangana called Karan the spreader of nepotism in Bollywood
 iske kuch dinon baad landan ke skool of economix main yojie hue ek event ke dauraan karan johar se kangana ranut ke bare main puche jane par kaha, 'main kangana ke 'mahila card' or 'victim card' se pareshaan ho gaya hum
 Karan said during this time, whenever you get a chance, you cannot always act like a victim like you have been terrorized a lot in Bollywood industry
 agar yah itani hi buree he to ise chhod den
 ' mumbai mirar ko die apane intervyuu main kangana ranut ne kaha, ' main karan johar kii samaj par koi baat nahin kar sakati ki vah 'nepotism' (bhai-bhatijawad) kaa kya matlab samajhate hai
 If he understands that it is limited only to sons and daughters, cousins or relatives, then i cannot say anything to his understanding
 ' Karan Johar had said in London that she would not have been able to speak anything like this if she had not given the platform to Kangana
 is par kangana ne kaha, 'mujhe yah samaj nahin aayaa ki vah apane sho main bula kar mujhe platefom kaise de sakate hai

 ' In this interview to Mumbai Mirror, Kangana said, 'I don't understand why Karan Johar is embarrassing a woman to be his woman? What does this 'women's card' or 'victim Card' mean? Having said this, they have insulted every woman who really needs such 'cards'
 yah 'women card' shaayad aapke yaa kisi olympic vijeta yaa kisi rashtriya puraskaar vijeta ke kaam bhale hi na aae, lekin yah ek pregnent mahila ko bheed bhari bas main 'ladies' seat dilaane ke kaam aata he
 It can be used as a cry when a woman feels threatened

 On this, Kangana told Mumbai Mirror, 'now Karan Johar is the father of a small daughter, in such a situation, he should give all these' cards' to his daughter, such as' Women's Card ',' Victim Card 'and' self-made ' - Independent Women's Card '
 yaa shaayad 'adiyal card' jo maine unke sho par istemaal kiya tha

 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed Chief Minister Mayawati for opposing the National Food Security Bill and said that after implementation of this law, no poor in the country will sleep hungry
 unhone bahujan samaaj party (basapa), samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) par uttar pradesh main keval jati or dharm kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Addressing a party rally in Kasganj town of Etah, Rahul Gandhi said, "mayawati never saw starving people with her eyes
" vah kabhi gaanvon main nahin gayi
 Without thinking, one minute says that no one will benefit from this food security law
 main kahata hum ki puure hindustan ko phayda hoga
 After this law, no poor in India will sleep hungry
 " mayawati sarkaar par vikaas ke liye bheje gaye centre ke paise main bhrashtachar karne kaa aarope lagaate hue rahul ne kaha, "ham vibhinn kendriya yojanaon ke jariye hajaaron karod rupee aapke liye bhejte hai, lekin sara paisa lakhanu main baitha 'hathi' kha rahaa he, jise mayawati ne jaadu karke banaaya he
 "he said," For the last 22 years, everyone in Uttar Pradesh is doing politics of caste and religion only
 garibi, berogari dur karne or vikaas kii baat koi nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that Uttar Pradesh is the largest state of India till it wakes up
 
 The country will not move forward
 " rahul ne kaha, "aapane anya dalon ko 22 saal die
 What have you got 
 
 kuch nahin
 Now give five years to the Congress party, change will begin here
 das saal main surat aisi badalegi ki aap apane pradesh ko pahchaan nahin paaenge
 We want to form a government of every class in Uttar Pradesh
 " Smart and intelligent leaders know that their time is limited and power is transitory

 They are not afraid to start something that they know will not be possible to achieve in their tenure

 But government work is also very patient in such times, when leaders of big democracies communicate with their people and opponents through social media, when the Prime Minister of Malaysia writes a 400-word note to assure the world that The wreckage found in France's Reunion Island is arguably the same as the MH370 aircraft that went missing 515 days ago; Or when Obama tries to instill new craze in the American people by sending a message to NASA space station astronauts on Twitter, when Narendra Modi last Monday at 6 pm
 30 baje ek mahatvapurn faisle kii jaankaree dene ke liye bamushkil 100 shabdon kaa samvaad bhejkar desh ke logon ko intjaar karne par majaboor karte hai
 If you want or you can say in more precise words, then you can say that this is the speed of change
 aap gambhir bibisi ankar nik going ke shabdon ko udhaar lekar use vaastavik samay kaa atyaachaar kah sakate hai
 But it has to demonstrate exceptional political maturity and shrewd leaders maintain institutional continuity

 This is the correct week of debate on continuity as Modi's 'important announcement' was to settle the rest of the agreement with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) led by Thuigalang Muivah and Issac Chisi Swu

 This continued in the short run of the governments of Deve gowda-gujral, NDA Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee added new energy to it and UPA Prime Minister Manmohan Singh carried it out neatly for almost a decade
 aaj modi ne is kaam ko uske anjaam tak pahunchaaya he
 Now look at it this way
 yah prakriya 20 saal tak jari rahi or is bich enessien ne sarkaron ke badalane ke kaaran chah pradhanmantriyon se baatcheet kii
 But we can proudly say that he was in constant conversation with the Indian establishment
 vajah yah he ki loktantr main sarkarein to aati-jaati rahati hai, lekin sanvaidhanik rajya kii satta berokatoke jari rahati he
 Whatever happened to the Naga agreement, the Congress mocked the Modi government for taking credit for its idea and initiative
 isamen naga samjhaute ke alaava bangladesh se bhoomi seemaa samjhauta, parmaanu qaraar ko aage badhaane ke liye parmanujavabdehi kanoonko dhilaa karnaa, aadhaar par shirshasana karnaa or ise nakad hastantaran yojana main lagu karnaa shaamil he
 Not only this, first the notification of inviting FDI in LPG subsidy and then naturally in the retail market, the legislation of 49 percent FDI approval in the insurance sector was carried forward
 yah sahi he ki ye sabhi vichaar upie ke daur main hi saamne aae or usee ne isamen pahal kii
 But look at it with some conditions
 ek to upie sarkaar ne puure 10 saal raaj kiya
 He had both the mandate and the time to pursue new ideas
 sach kahen to uske paas inhen amal main laane kaa puraa vakt tha lekin vah sonia gandhi kii aguai vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) ke dabaav main bhatak gai (enesi aadhaar, nakad hastantaran, khudara bazaar main epadi vagairah ke prati sashankit thi)
 Then, with the scandal session and the landing of Anna Hazare on the national stage in 2011, the UPA government lost its political capital
 ab use apane vichaaron komodi par churaane kaa aropalgane ke badale khush hona chahie ki ve unhen shiddat se aage badha rahe hai
 In less mature democracies, a successor could be tempted to write off all his predecessor's schemes
 lekin yahaan to ulataa ho rahaa he
 This is not something new or unique
 hamaare zyaadaatar rashtriya netaaon ne aisi hi vyaavhaarikta kaa parichay diya he
 It is different that the current Prime Minister is showing too much enthusiasm to take credit
 modi ne upie kii behatar bauddhik urja ko apane laabh ke liye istemaal karne kii acchhee samajhadaari dikhaai he
 Not only this, he has shown another ability that the UPA was absolutely lacking, that is, the ability to raise public opinion for new revolutionary ideas
 unhone alpiji nakad hastantaran ko garib samarthak sudhaar bataakar logon ke saamne rakhaa or vyaktigat rup se 'give it ap' (sabsidi lenaa band karo) abhiyaan ko is kadar protsaahit kiya ki lage ki garib kii sabsidi churaana dhani logon ke liye behad galat he
 In a joint press conference with Obama, he called the nuclear deal the centerpiece of the new india-us relationship (and described it as good for the people of India)
 phir, bangladesh ke saath bhoomi seemaa samjhaute ko vyaktigat pratishtha kaa sawaal bana liya or ab pradhanmantri nivas, 7 aarasiar main naga samjhaute jaisi badi rashtriya ghatana ko anjaam diya
 The Congress complains that Modi is riding his thoughts
 lekin jaraa sochie, koi chota desh hota to ve in sabko kinare kar chuke hote
 And if the UPA government was more confident or its political managers were better, then it would not leave the entire matter incomplete
 ab ham is nuktachini ko jaraa pare rakh den, kyonki yah haftaa khabaron se bharaapura rahaa he or acchhee daleelein ubharkar saamne ai hai
 Institutional continuity is critical in determining the destiny of countries

 narsingh raav ne parmaanu pareekshan ke liye jaruri sabhi taiyaari puri kar lee thi magar unhen ehsaas hua ki unke paas iske liye rajnatik puunji nahin he or na hi bharat ke paas uske nattejey jhelane ke liye aarthik tathaa rajnatik takat he
 However, if they had fallen for this prudence in the greed of their political selfishness, they would have probably gained huge benefits in the 1996 election

 Especially in an interview with eminent nuclear scientist Anil Kakodar recently revealed this

 dilli ke khyala main kathith taur par duusare dharm kii ladki se prem karne ke chalate maar daale gaye ankit saxena ke maamle main kai nae khulaase hue hai
 The most important question is also answered that when the love affair between Ankit and Shehzadi had been going on for four years, then what happened suddenly that the family members of Shehzadi killed Ankit
 darasal shahzadi haal hi main balig hui he or ankit or shahzadi jald hi shaadi karne kii yojana bana rahe the
 During the interrogation, the father of the arrested Shehzadi told the police that on the day of the incident, Shehzadi came out of the house and closed the door from outside, telling the family that she was going to marry Ankit
 shahzadi ke ankit se shaadi karne kaa elaan karne ke chalate hi shahzadi ke pita agbabula ho uthe
 At first the family sought Shahzadi, but when she could not find it, they went straight to Ankit's house
 shahzadi kii maa sabase pehle ankit se ulajh padin
 Then Shehzadi's father, maternal uncle and minor brother beat up Ankit together
 ankit ke saath marpet kaa shor sunakar ankit ke mata-pita bhi ghar se baahar nikal aae
 People from nearby also gathered
 ankit ne police ko bulaane yaa police thane chalane kii baat bhi kahi
 But the ghost of the princess was seeking revenge and they ran away killing Ankit
 ek hi mohalle main rahete the ankit, shahzadi ke parivarjankaree ke mutabik, shahzadi kaa parivaar bhi pehle ankit ke mohalle main hi rahata tha or isi dauraan donon ke bich prem hua
 But the family of Shehzadi did not like to love Shehzadi with a boy of other religion and due to this they left the Mohalla and shifted elsewhere
 lekin ankit or shahzadi kaa prem feekaa nahin padaa
 About a year ago, her marriage was fixed by the family of the princess, but the relationship broke up by the princess
 shahzadi kaa parivaar ab jis mohalle main rahata he, vahaan aas-pados ke logon ne bataaya ki shahzadi or usee ilaake main rahane vaale unke kuch rishtedaar bhi ghar band kar kahin chale gaye hai
 According to neighbors, shehzadi was not very similar to the people and at times she would get beaten up from inside the house
 lekin baat itani badi ho jaaegi, kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Shehzadi's mother Shehnaz ran a beauty parlor in her old neighborhood, Raghubir Nagar
 ankit kii hatya ke baad se parlor band he
 According to Vinod, the owner of the shop who rented the shop for Ankit's videoplar a few minutes before the murder, Shahnaz had been running the parlor here for the last 9 years
 uskaa kaam bhi acha chalata tha
 Seeing the safety of the family, Vinod has vacated the precautionary parlor and sent all the goods to Shahnaz's sister
 vinod kii patni ne bataaya ki shahzadi bhi aksar maa ke saath aati rahati thi
 Shehzadi, however, has been sent out of Delhi along with her relatives
 shahzadi ne bataaya ki uske pita uski ankit se shaadi se manaa kar rahe the or use aage padhai karne ke bare main bolte rahete the
 The people watching, the help of the e-rickshaw driver has revealed many shocking things in the killing of Ankita
 hamale se ghayal ankit jameen par gir gaya or kai minuton tak tadapata rahaa
 But no one came forward to save him

 ) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has once again tried to surround the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), citing natural funding
 jetali ne fasebuk par post likhakar poocha he ki agar kejariwal aaj bhi revenue afasar hote or unke paas is tarah kaa cese aata to vah kya karte?jetali ne likhaa he, 'kya check se paise lene par saare aparaadh maaf ho jate hai? vah farjivada karne vaale par inakam tex act ke tahat karrwai karte yaa use ipisi ke tahat giraftaar karte? saaf he ki arvind kejariwal tex kanoonon se aparichit nahin hai
 He knew what his party was doing
 unhen eemaandaaree se logon ko bataanaa chahie ki arvind kejariwal, IRS adhikari is sthiti main kya karata?'arun jetali kii is post par pehla coment he, 'vitt mantri karrwai karne ke bajaay shikaayat kar rahe hai
 This is sad
 'gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle hi aam aadmi party par 'avam' naam ke sanghathan par farji pate kii companiyon se chanda lene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 'awam' alleges that AAP collected a total of Rs 2 crore from three companies
 in companiyon kaa pan card he, ye ek jhuggi ke pate par registerd hai, lekin inke munaafe-ghate kaa koi hisaab nahin he
 To this, the AAP said that they did not legally receive any wrong donations
 kejariwal ne vitt mantri ko chunauti di thi ki agar unki party ne galat chanda liya he to unhen giraftaar kiya jaae
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party has taken refuge in the Supreme Court on the matter
 court ne teenon partiyon (BJP, congress or AAP) kii funding kii jaanch ke liye esaiti banane kaa anurodh kiya he
 However, the Finance Minister says that there is no need to drag the court in this matter
 mumbai hamale ke mastermind or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sansthaapak hafiz said ko apni suraksha kii chintaa sataane lagi he
 Therefore, he has deployed a special team of Lashkar terrorists under his protection
 hafiz said kii suraksha ke liye lashkar ne ek special sicurity team kaa gathan kiya he
 On Friday, when Hafiz Saeedane rallied against America, this team was seen deployed in its security
 is special team main shaamil lashkar ke aatankiyon ko vishesh training di gai he, jo ab jamaat-ud-daawa ke sargana hafiz said kii suraksha kar rahe hai
 This special team of terrorists carry arms and ammunition
 pakistan ke gujranvala main jiti road par march ke dauraan hafiz said lashkar aatankiyon kii is special team ke suraksha ghere main rahaa
 After his recent release from detention, Hafiz Saeed has announced to contest the upcoming elections in Pakistan
 iske liye vah abhi se maahaul bana rahaa he
 Hafiz Saeed sometimes spews venom against India over Kashmir issue, sometimes marches against America
 uskaa maananaa he ki bharat or america ke dabaav main pakistan ne usko kareeb 10 maheene tak najarband rakhaa tha
 At the same time, the US is in the mood to put many other Pakistani organizations, including the Milli Muslim League (MML), the most wanted terrorist, Hafiz Saeed's political party
 sutron kii maane to america kii ore se yah sakht karrwai jald hi kii ja sakati he
 Taking action on India's appeal, the US is considering many Pakistani organizations as terrorist organizations
 haal hi main nai dilli main hui bharat or america ke bich ek conference main is baat kii apil kii gai thi
 a US official said that Pakistan is a good partner of America, but the United States is always trying to end terrorism
 haalanki adhikari ne saaf taur par kisi pakistani sanghathan kaa naam nahin liya
 But in the last few days, the strictness of the US on the political entry of Hafiz Saeed is giving some similar signs
 isse pehle america kii ore se yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ghoshit karne ke virodh main lahore main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue hafiz said ne kaha tha ki agar yuddh hua, to america ko duniya ke nakshe se mitaa diya jayega

 pakistan sarkaar ne kanoonmantri jaahid hamid ko purv sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ke saath unke samparkon ko lekar pad se hataa diya he
 The trial is likely to begin in connection with the charge of treason against Musharraf
 tippaniyan Hamid was a law minister in Pervez Musharraf's government when the military regime imposed an emergency in 2007
 hamid uske baad pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii piemail-en party main shaamil ho gaye
 PML-N won the general election last month
 sarkaar ne hamid ko kanoonmantri ke prabhaar se ho rahi aalochana ke baad hataaya ki vah us vyavastha kaa hissaa the, jisane musharraf ke apatkaal lagane or nyaayadhishon ko hiraasat main rakhane ke nirnay kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He has been assigned science and technology charge
 hamid parvej musharraf kii sarkaar main kanoonmantri rahe the, jab sainya shashan ne varsh 2007 main apatkaal lagaaya tha
 Hamid then joined Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N party

 The government removed Hamid from the charge of the law minister following criticism that he was part of a system that supported Musharraf's decision to impose emergency and detain judges
 unhen vigyaan or praudyogiki prabhaar saunpa gaya he

 While the Union Government is patting its back on the proposal to launch a campaign called Revitalizing Infrastructure and Systems in Education (rise) to increase investment in educational institutions, teachers' unions and student unions are protesting against it
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main yah bhi kaha tha ki is abhiyaan ko fund karne ke liye hair ajukeshan financing agency (hepha) ko upyukt tareeke se taiyaar kiya jayega
 Why the ruckus? Actually the government has planned to raise some part of its funds to the central universities and leading institutes like IIT, IIM
 or isko lekar shikshak-sanghon or chaatr sanghathanon naaraaz hai
 Now these institutions will get the funds through Hefa, not directly with the government fund
 sarkaar ne sitambar 2016 main hi hepha ke gathan ke prastaav par muhar laga di thi
 Hefa is formed in partnership with Canara Bank, which will also receive funds from the market
 nai shiksha niti ke tahat yah yojana banaai gai he
 Central universities will have to raise at least 10 per cent of the total funds from HIFA itself, the government will pay the remaining 90 per cent
 iity, enity or iiem jaise sansthaanon ko 25 fisadi khud janaret karnaa hoga
 As an autonomous institution, universities will have to raise 30 percent of the funds themselves for salaries
 is nai niti ke khilaaf kya hai tarkaduta ke upaadhyaksh sudhanshu kumaar kehete hai, ''yah saaf taur par ucch shiksha se sarkaar kaa haath kheenchna he
 "the reason for the teachers union's displeasure with the funds of the universities is also related to the salary paid to the teachers and professors themselves
 darasal, 30 janvari ko vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) ne saatven vetan ayog ke tahat pe-revijan ko lekar sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko patr likhaa ki ise 13 janvari 2016 ko bheje gaye vitt mantralay ke disha-nirdesh se hi karyanvit kiya jayega
 According to him, as an autonomous institution, universities will have to raise 30 per cent of the funds themselves for salaries
 isse bhi sarkaar kii nai funding niti kaa khulaasa hota he
 Sudhanshu says, "from where will the government universities raise funds, are they not private profit-making companies?" One of the main demands of teachers and employees is to continue to provide 100 per cent funds from the government
 emecharadi ke rajya mantri upendra kushvaha ne india today se kaha, ''korporate research ke jariye santhaan fund arjeet kar saken, aisi vyavastha he
 For example, faculty and students can research with corporate companies and generate funds
 " lekin duuta ke purv adhyaksh aditya narayan mishra kehete hai, ''30 pratishat rakam koi choti rakam nahin he
 "however, Sudhanshu explains," The government has planned to sign a memorandum between UGC, MHRD and central universities
 iske formet main 30 fisadi ke fund janareshan ke tareeke main elmnai, yujar charge or fees badhaane ke upaay bataae gaye hai
 Now can the institute run somewhere with alumini funds? ”whereas the increase in user charge and fees will obviously affect the students
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay kii chaatrasangh adhyaksh gita kumari kahati hai, ''sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki vah sabhi ke liye shiksha afordable banaae lekin vah to iskaa ulta karne ko vishvavidhyalayon ko majaboor kar rahi he
 "A similar argument is that of Adityanarayan Mishra
 ve sarkaar ke rij abhiyaan or hepha ke jariye funding kii niti ko ucch shiksha ke nijeekaran kii kavayad bataate hai
 He says, "if social changes have been possible since independence, they have been through education, especially with higher education
" sarkaar ne iskaa anudaan lagaataar kam karte hue ise hi kamjor kar diya
 Now the BJP government is really bent on making grant based education as loan based education
 "vahiin ujisi ke ek purv chairman naam na jaahir karne kii shart par bataate hai ki fund kaa kuch hissaa khud janaret karne kii niti se sansthaanon kii swaittata prabhavit hogi
 However, Anil Sadgopal, an educationist and member of the board of presidents of the All India Education Rights Forum, believes that this is not a new policy
 ve kehete hai, ''modi sarkaar pichley teen saal se yahi kar rahi he
 As soon as he came, IIT, central universities etc
 asked the institutes to generate their own funds, they should raise funds from alumni, corporate etc
 isiilie iity-iiem vagairah kii fees pichley teen saal main kareeb teen guna bad chuki he
 Overall, the government's decision is that it will not fund education
 " ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''vartmaan sarkaar kaa mahaamantra he ki jisaki kuwwat he to shiksha paae, jisaki nahin he vah shiksha se baahar nikal jaae
 "some leading institutions may also raise funding, but for most institutions and central universities, raising funds will prove to be crooked
 sudhanshu kehete hai ki vishvavidhyalayon ke paas chaatro kii fees badhaane ke sivaay or koi chaara nahin rahegaa
 Sudhanshu says, "in fact, our institutions have also faced a crisis
 so, ham chup nahin rahenge
 On February 16, we will perform in front of MHRD which will also include students from various institutions
 uske baad 27 farvari ko diu main shikshakon kii general body meeting rakhi he
 If the government does not back down from its action, we will move towards a bigger strike again
 " jaahir he, sarkaar ke liye aage kii raah aasaan nahin or shikshak tathaa chaatr aar-paar ke mood main hai
 Education did not get attention in the budget: While there has been a slight increase in the total budget of higher education, the budget cuts of autonomous institutions like central universities have also filled the teachers and students with doubts

 There was a demonstration by people lying in the pit, which was discussed a lot on social media
 shuukravaar kii shaam apane naati vicky maanjhi kii giraftaar ke baad bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne aarope lagaaya he unke naati ko sharaab maamle main fansaaya gaya he
 Vicky Manjhi was arrested by Gaya police on Friday evening and recovered several bottles of liquor from his car
 vicky ko sharaab ke saath tab giraftaar kiya gaya, jab vah jharkhand ke chatra se waapas apane ghar gaya aa rahaa tha
 Talking to reporters on Saturday, Jitan Ram Manjhinay told that as he had accused the Gaya administration on Friday that she was colluding with the sand mafia in the district, the police went within 2 hours to avenge the same
 The grandson was arrested
 police ne badla lene ke liye mere naati ko giraftaar kiya
 i accused the Gaya administration of rigging
 2 ghante ke andar hi mere naati ko police ne giraftaar kar liya
 Where did Manjhi say that he will not try to save his grandson and the law will do its job in this case
 maanjhi ne isi bich jati kaa card bhi khel diya or aarope lagaaya ki unke parivaaravaalon ko isiilie fansaaya gaya he, kyonkiwah dalit hai
 In the meantime, Manjhi also gave a shocking statement, when he said that if his grandson had one or two lakh rupees, he would have given it to the police
 jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha ne kaha ki yah baat sach he ki amir log paise ke dam par police se sharaab maamle main funsane ke baavjood batch jate hai, magar meraa naati garib he or vah ek yaa do lakh rupee intjaam nahin kar saktaa he
 Manjhi also feared that he might be implicated in the new liquor ban law and for this the people of the government could also plant liquor bottles at his house
 bhartiya janata party ne aaj maang kii he ki 4,000 karod rupee ke viviipi helicopter saude main bhrashtachar kii jaanch supreme court kii nigaraanee main karai jaae
 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said that this investigation will be completed on time and will be able to give the result when it is being monitored by the Supreme Court, otherwise it will remain as a lip-granddaughter

 In the meantime, the government has stopped the payment of arrears to this company for about 24 hundred crores at present
 yah roak tab tak lagi rahegi jab tak sibiai jaanch ke parinaam nahin aate
 The comments vahiin, is mudde par congress or bijepi ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 The Congress has said that the terms of the tender changed in 2003, when the bjp-led NDA government was in power and Brajesh Mishra was the National Security Advisor
 vahiin, bijepi kaa kahana he ki brajesh mishra ne special protection group yani espiji kii salaah par badlaav kii maangen kii thim, kyonki jin viviipi logon ke liye ye helicopter kharide jane the, unki suraksha kii jimmedaari espiji par hi he
 The BJP also says that the helicopter deal was signed in 2010, when the Congress-led UPA government was in power and therefore the government should take responsibility for it and reveal the names of the people benefiting from the deal
 bijepi pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki yah jaanch tabhi samay par puri ho paaegi or nateeja de paaegi, jab isaki nigaraanee supreme court kar rahaa ho, varanaa yah lipa-potee banakar rah jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that the CBI is investigating whether an Indian official was bribed from Italian company Finmeccanica to materialize the deal
 is bich, sarkaar ne is company ko hone vaale bakaayaa takreeban 24 sau karod rupee ke bhugtan par philhal roak laga di he
 This stay will continue till the results of the CBI investigation

 congress ne kaha he ki tender kii sharton main 2003 main badlaav hue, jab bijepi ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar satta main thi or brajesh mishra rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar the
 At the same time, BJP says that Brajesh Mishra had demanded changes on the advice of the Special Protection Group, ie SPG, because the responsibility of the security of the VVIP people for whom these helicopters were to be purchased is with the SPG
 bijepi kaa yah bhi kahana he ki helicopter ke saude par 2010 main hastakshar hue, jis vakt congress nit upie sarkaar satta main thi or isliye sarkaar ko isaki jimmedaari leni chahie or saude se phayda uthaane vaale logon ke naam jaahir karne chahie

 The traders did not get enough assurance from the Chief Minister and demanded that their shops be opened soon
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhane kii baat kahi or saath hi ye bhi kaha ki agar ceiling nahin rukati he to vah 31 march se khud dharne par baith jaaenge
 Congress councilor of the area Abhishek Dutt asked the Chief Minister directly, in response to which he did not say much and left the businessmen with assurance
 market association ke adhyaksh vijay ji kaa kahana he, ye ceiling puri tarah najayas he
 And we no longer have any hope from the Chief Minister
 hamen sabhi dukaane waapas chahie or iske liye ham har ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 Manoj tiwaridilli, who came to meet the traders, went to the hospital to meet the injured businessmen in a police clash during the sealing that took place in the Amar Colony Market on bjp's President, Sakshamnoj Tiwari Shukravar
 unhone is maukey par 'ajtak' se kaha, 'ye jo bhi hua vah thik nahin he
 i have also spoken to the police
 isaki jaanch honi chahie kyonki peetane vaale vyapaariyon kii manshaa thik nahi thi
 When Chief Minister Kejriwal reached Amar Colony, Manoj Tiwari said, he should resign taking responsibility for whatever is happening
 teen saalon main arvind ji ko vyapaariyon kii samasyaon ko hal kar dena chahie tha, vah sivaay raajnneeti ke or kuch nahin kar rahe
 On the issue of sealing, he says that by Tuesday, he will present a concrete affidavit in the court so that the need to amend the masterplan can be put before the court

 In the last four days, Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri appeared on the streets of the country's capital, Islamabad, leading anti-government protesters heading towards Parliament
 pehle din kii tulana main baad main pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya bhale hi ghat gai ho, lekin dharmaguru ke bhaashanon kii aag thandi nahin hui
 On Wednesday too, he addressed his supporters for four consecutive hours in a bulletproof vehicle parked at some distance from the Pakistani Parliament
 ab charchaa garm he ki kya kadri pakistan kii raajnneeti main machi uthal-puthal ko khatm kar paaenge
 The question that is emerging most in people's minds is whether Qadri can become the new hope of Pakistan's politics, and whether his performances and speeches have brought a new twist in the current political situation of the country
 islamabad main neshnal asembli ke saamne kaa nazaaraa is vakt kuch−kuch kahiraa ke taharir squaire or pichley maheene dilli ke rajpath jaisaa nazar aa rahaa he
 Pakistan's Sufi cleric Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri, who returned from Canada last month, is gathering outside the National Assembly with his supporters
 pakistan sarkaar kii peshaani par bal nazar aane lage hai
 Qadri is said to want to convert Islamabad's d-square into Egypt's Tahrir Square, where the spark against the ruling government took the form of flames
 yah bhi khabar he ki mohammad taahir-ul-kadri ke khilaaf islamabad ke koshar thane main exiaar darj kar lee gai he
 Let us know, who is Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri, who suddenly appeared and dominated the political map of Pakistan
 darasal, kadri sufi vidwaan hai or punjab vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sanvaidhanik kanoon ke professor rah chuke hai, lekin dharmik upadesh dete−dete vah achaanak bhrashtachar va aatankwaad ke khilaaf or maanavadhikaar va aman ke haq kii awaz ban gaye hai
 For the first time in Pakistan, a crowd is seen behind such a religious leader who is not speaking in favor of the jihadis
 mohammad taahir-ul-kadri kaa agenda lanbaa−chaudaa he
 He wants the electoral system of Pakistan to be reformed, a caretaker government is formed till a clean election is held, the governments of the country and the states are dissolved in 24 hours, a campaign against corruption and openness in the system is seen
 pakistan ke saath-saath canada kii bhi naagarikta rakhane vaale kadri ne varsh 2010 main dehshatgardi ke khilaaf fatwa jari kiya tha, lekin dohari naagarikta ke chalate vah pakistan main chunaav nahin lard sakate
 Despite this, the Government of Pakistan is in awe of them
 shaayad isliye, kyonki pakistan ke punjab or duusare kai suubon main unki kai sansthaaen or hazaron samarthak hai
 Qadri has the support of about 10 lakh people and these are the people who are strongly against the current government
 ye 10 lakh log bhale hi sarkaar banane ke liye kaaphi nahin hai, lekin pehle hi kai tarah ke sankaton se jujh rahi sarkaar ke sankaton ko dobala karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 The comments varsh 2010 main mohammad taahir-ul-kadri ne dharmik sandesh jari kar aatankwaad or aatmghaatee hamalon kii mukhaalafat kii thi, jisase vah lokapriy hue
 He runs an educational and religious organization, which has a worldwide presence
 vah aparaadhiyon ko raajnneeti se baahar karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 He is determined to bring a change in the political system of Pakistan, and vows that he will not go back until this happens
 ek intervyuu main unhone 'chunavi taanaashaahee' or 'taharir squaire' jaisi sthiti kii taraf bhi ishaara kiya
 He wants a system in which the honesty of the candidates is investigated, and this demand has led analysts to compare him with Anna Hazare and the Lokpal movement
 vaise pakistan main lagaataar ho rahe aatankwaadi hamalon, or prashasan main bade paimaane par maujuud bhrashtachar ke chalate hi log badi sankhya main mohammad taahir-ul-kadri ke samarthan main aa rahe hai
 Qadri seems to have the backing of the army as well, and experts even say that Rawalpindi (army Headquarters) has raised him to ensure turmoil in the country
 bataaya jaataa he ki zyaadaatar pakistaniyon ko sufi vichaardhaara se koi dikkat nahin he
 Pakistan is to have a general election in March, and if power goes from one civilian government to another civilian government, it will be the first time in the history of Pakistan
 paak kaa siyaasi maahaul is vakt nawaz sharif ke paksh main he, or vah sena par lagaam kas sakate hai
 In such a situation, the army would like political upheaval in the country, so that the elections are postponed and a weak interim government comes there
 pichley chaar dinon main desh kii rajdhani islamabad kii sadakon par mohammad taahir-ul-kadri sansad kii ore badhate sarkaar-virdohi pradarshnakariyon kaa netritv karte dikhaai die
 The number of protesters may have decreased later than the first day, but the fire of the religious speeches did not cool down
 buudhvaar ko bhi pakistani sansad se kuch duuri par khadey kiye gaye ek bulatopruf vaahan se unhone apane samarthakon ko lagaataar chaar ghante tak sambodhit kiya
 Now the discussion is hot whether Qadri will be able to end the turmoil in Pakistan's politics
 logon ke zahan main jo sawaal sabase zyaada ubhar rahaa he, vah yahi he ki kya kadri pakistan kii raajnneeti kii nai ummid ban sakate hai, or kya unke pradarshan or bhaashan desh kii maujuuda rajnatik paristhitiyon main nayaa mode lekar aae hai
 The scene in front of the National Assembly in Islamabad is somewhat like Tahrir Square in Cairo and Rajpath in Delhi last month
 canada se pichley maheene laute pakistan ke sufi dharmaguru mohammad taahir-ul-kadri apane samarthakon ke saath neshnal asembli ke baahar jamaa hai
 The force of the government of Pakistan is beginning to be seen
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kadri islamabad ke di-squaire ko misr ke taharir squaire main badalanaa chaahate hai, jahaan sattarudh sarkaar ke khilaaf chingaari ne lapaton kaa rup liya tha
 It is also reported that an FIR has been registered against Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri at Kosher police station in Islamabad
 aaie jaanate hai, aakhir koun hai mohammad taahir-ul-kadri, jo achaanak pakistan ke raajnneetik nakshe par nazar aae or chaa gaye
 In fact, Qadri is a Sufi scholar and a professor of international constitutional law at the University of Punjab, but while giving religious teachings, he has suddenly become a voice against corruption and terrorism and the right to human rights and peace
 pakistan main pehali baar aise mazahabi netaa ke peeche bheed nazar aa rahi he, jo jihadiyon ke haq main nahin bol rahaa he
 Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri has a broad agenda
 vah chaahate hai ki pakistan kii chunaav pranali main sudhaar ho, saaf−suthere chunaav hone tak kaamchalaoo sarkaar banaai jaae, 24 ghante main desh or suubon kii sarkarein bhang kar di jaaen, bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim chale or vyavastha main khulaapan nazar aae
 Qadri, who holds citizenship in Pakistan as well as in Canada, issued a fatwa against terror in 2010, but due to dual citizenship, he cannot contest elections in Pakistan
 iske baavjood pakistan sarkaar unase khauf kha rahi he
 Probably because he has many organizations and thousands of supporters in Pakistan's Punjab and other states
 kadri ko kareeb 10 lakh logon kaa samarthan hasil he or ye ve log hai, jo maujuuda sarkaar ke sakht khilaaf hai
 These 10 lakh people may not be enough to form a government, but they are enough to counteract the crises of a government already facing many types of crises
 tippaniyan In 2010, Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri issued a religious message against terrorism and suicide attacks, which made him popular
 vah ek shaikshanik or dharmik sanghathan chalaate hai, jisaki maujuudagi duniyabar main he
 He is demanding that criminals be excluded from politics
 unhone pakistan ke raajnneetik tantra main badlaav laane kii thaanee he, or sankalp liya he ki jab tak aisa nahin hota, vah waapas nahin jaaenge
 In an interview, he also pointed to a situation like 'electoral dictatorship' and 'tahrir Square'
 vah aisa system chaahate hai, jisamen ummidavaaron kii eemaandaaree kii jaanch kii jaae, or isi maang ke chalate vishleshak unki tulana anna hajaare or lokapal andolan se karne lage hai
 However, due to the continuous terrorist attacks in Pakistan, and the rampant corruption in the administration, people are coming in support of Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri in large numbers
 aisa lagata he ki kadri ko sena kaa samarthan bhi hasil he, or visheshgyon kaa yahaan tak kahana he ki desh main uthal-puthal sunishchit karne ke liye rawalpindi (sena mukhyalay) ne hi unhen khadaa kiya he
 It is said that most Pakistanis have no problem with Sufi ideology
 pakistan main march main aam chunaav hone hai, or agar vahaan ek asainya sarkaar ke haath se satta duusari asainya sarkaar ke haath main jaati he to yah pakistan ke itihaas main pehali baar hoga
 The political atmosphere of Pakistan is in favor of Nawaz Sharif right now, and he can control the army
 aise main army desh main raajnneetik uthal-puthal chaahegi, taaki chunaav tal jaaen or vahaan ek kamjor antarim sarkaar aa jaae

 The election campaign for the sixth phase will come to an end today
 is charan main sabaki najar upi kii viviipi seat azamgarh par he
 Akhilesh Yadav himself is in the fray from this seat
 haalanki, akhilesh abhi tak yahaan chunaav prachaar karne sirf 2 baar gaye hai
 Addressing a joint rally with BSP chief Mayawati for the first time during nomination and the second time
 prachaar ke aakhri din akhilesh kai jansabhaon ko sambodhit karne jane vaale the, lekin ain vakt par program radd kar diya gaya
 Now, in such a situation, the question arises that who has taken over the command of Akhilesh's election campaign in Azamgarh? The youth cadre of Mulayam Family has taken over the responsibility of winning Akhilesh Yadav from Azamgarh
 azamgarh sansadeey seat ke tahat 5 vidhansabha siten (gopalpur, sagadi, mubarakapur, azamgarh or mehnagar) aati hai
 In 2017, the BSP won 2 of these seats and the SP on 3 seats
 har vidhansabha kshetra kii jimmedaari ek bade netaa ko di gai he
 Apart from this, the workers of the organization of SP and BSP have been given the responsibility of every booth
 mulaayam family kii yang bigrade kaa prachaarkai dinon se akhilesh yadav ke chachere bhai or badaayun se saansad dharmendra yadav, firozabad se saansad akshay yadav or akhilesh ke bhattije va mainpuri se saansad tej pratap yadav ne kaman sanbhali hui he
 Tej Pratap Yadav is campaigning in Meghnagar and Gopalpur assembly constituencies
 iske alaava sagadi, gopalpur or azamgarh ke kai ilaakon main dharmendra yadav ne akhilesh ke liye prachaar kiya
 Like Dharmendra, Akshay is also seeking votes for Akhilesh in Azamgarh
 iske alaava team akhilesh ke atul pradhan bhi azamgarh main jame hue hai
 Local SP-BSP leaders handled Morchamulayam kunbe, apart from SP-BSP local leaders and workers are working hard for Akhilesh's victory in Azamgarh
 inamen purv mantri balram yadav, ram govind choudhary, azamgarh se vidhayak or purv mantri durga prasad yadav, sapa jiladhyaksh hawaldaar yadav, basapa jiladhyaksh arvind kumaar, basapa vidhayak shah alam urf guddu jamaali, sapa vidhayak kalpanaath paswan, basapa vidhayak vandana singh samet donon dalon ke netaaon kii ek badi fouj lagi hui he
 What is the strategy? After Dinesh Lal Nirhua came into the fray, the SP has given its full strength to this seat
 pichhali baar mulaayam singh sirf 65 hajaar voton se bijepi ke ramakant yadav se jite the
 In such a situation, the challenge is to prepare the ground for Akhilesh's big victory along with saving the seat in front of the SP
 iske liye akhilesh sarkaar dwaara azamgarh main karaae gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa jansabhaon or nukkad sabhaaon main zikr to kiya hi ja rahaa he
 Simultaneously, the d (dalit) equation with MY (muslim-yadav) is also being tried
 is seat par dalit 31 fisadi, yadav 17 fisadi or muslim 12 fisadi hai
 Special Yadav leaders of Yojana voters are mostly campaigning for Akhilesh in Azamgarh
 vajah yah he ki is seat par pichley 30 saal se yadav ummidavaar (do chunaav chhodkar) hi jitate hai
 The sp's best effort is to stop the Yadav vote split
 akhilesh yadav ne bhi apni azamgarh raily main siem yogi ke us bhaashan kii baat kii thi, jisamen yogi ne kaha tha ki agar samvidhan na hota to akhilesh kahin bhens charaate
 Through this, Akhilesh made an emotional appeal to the Yadavs
 isi tarah sapa netaa bhi imotional apil kar rahe hai
 At the same time, an appeal is being made to Muslims not to waste their vote by going towards Ulema Council
 usne anil singh ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he
 The responsibility of Dalit voters is also working hard this time for Akhilesh's victory over BSP
 basapa ke puure sanghathan ke alaava donon vidhayak guddu jamaali or vandana singh bhi akhilesh ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 bsp's responsibility is to bring Dalit voters in favor of SP
 iske liye basapa pramukh mayawati raily kar chuki hai
 Now the people of the organization are sending their messages to every booth so that Dalit votes cannot be scattered

 But when Salman Khan (salman Khan) entered the Weekend Ka Vaar today, everyone started supporting Aarti
 salmaan khan ne saaf taur par paras chhabda kaa bhi saath diya
 However, the members of the house tried to make Siddharth Shukla a villain
 salmaan khan (salman Khan) ne siddharth de (siddharth Dey) ke in bhadde shabdon ko majaak bataa daalaa
 However, Siddharth Dey also felt sorry about this
 lekin salmaan khan ne kaha ki wo riter hai, or is tarah ke gande joke maarthe rahete hai
 Salman Khan said that it was a similar joke
 is tarah salmaan khan ne siddharth de ke khilaaf ishyu nahin banane diya
 As it is, it has already been revealed about Siddharth Dey that he has written several shows for Salman Khan and he has also worked for Salman Khan's Dabangg Tour
 is tarah siddharth de kii bhaddi baat ko bhi salmaan khan ne majaak kahkar tone down kar diya
 Though all the household members tried to prove Siddharth Shukla as a villain, no one could prove anything against him
 is tarah siddharth shukla ek baar phir hero ke taur par ubharkar saamne aae

 On the 11th of August, Kerala Police arrested two men, who were hiring a 21-year-old girl for a peculiar job
 use yaman jaakar islamic state ke (ies) sainik ke taur par ladaai kerani thi
 Volunteers Sheena Farzana, 38, and 28-year-old Nasir, a Muslim charitable trust 'satyasarni' from an organization called Popular Front of India (PFI), were charged with kidnapping the 21-year-old girl (not being named) from Cherpulsari town in Palakkad district Was arrested police kaa kahana he ki mahila hindu thi, jise malappuram jile ke perinthalamanna main ek nijee company main kaam karne ke dauraan islam dharm apnaane ke liye phuslaaya gaya
 According to officials, the first act of seducing the girl was P
R
 naufal (jo ab yaman main he) ne kiya
 After that Nasir came forward, who is an active member of the satyasarni's claim squad
 trishur ke ijeepi e
 R
 ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''darasal, naufal ne ladki ko vishwaas dilaayaa tha ki ek sachche musalmaan kii tarah jindagi jeene or islam ke liye ladgaye se hi aadmi ko swarg miltaa he
 "the state police has alerted Interpol about the role of Nauphal in relation to recruitment for IS in the state
" lekin is tarah ke badhate maamle pichley kuch hafton se rajya bhar main charchaa kaa vishay ban gaye hai
 It started with a sensational disappearance of 21 people in July this year
 paanch pariwaron ke sadsy (sabhi ek-duusare se parichit the) uttari kerala ke apane gharon ko chhodkar iran ke liye hawaii jahaaj par savaar hue
 He is believed to have crossed IS controlled territory in Afghanistan
 unamem se 23 varshiya nimisha hindu thi, jo tiruvanantpuram se thi or dentist banane ke liye padhai kar rahi thi
 He had converted to Islam
 apana naam badalakar fatima rakh liya tha or bexton se shaadi kar lee thi
 Catholic Bexton converted to Islam in 2015 and became a Muslim
 uski maa ke
 Bindu had not received any news of her since May 28, when she left home
 usne india today ko bataaya ki ''mujhe nahin pataa ki meri beti kahaan he
 All i want is for her to return home safely
 ''is tarah kii kai kahaniyon ko kerala ke shahari 'lav jehad' ke tahat ek nai or khatarnaak chaal ke taur par 'bahala-phusalaakar' islam dharm kabool karwaane ke maamalon ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Police took action in this regard
 4 agast ko gaiyr-kanoonee gatividhi (rokthaam) adhinium (yuapie) ke tahat, jo aamtaur par aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke liye banaaya gaya he, 'iageies 21' ko doshi tehraaya gaya
 The state's intelligence wing has prepared a report on conversion
 india today ko hasil us report kii prati main likhaa he ki 2011 se 2015 tak rajya main 5,975 logon ne dharm parivartan kiya, jisamen se 1,410 to pichley saal kaa hi aankada he
 Nearly 76 percent of the new Muslims are women under 35, like Nimisha
 is saal janvari-farvari main 224 hinduon or 60 isaayiyon ne islam kabool kiya yani prati din teen vyakti kii dar se
 In most of such cases, there was no investigation before because the family members did not complain after the petition was rejected by the parents in the court
 haal ke maamle main 21 varshiya laapata ladki mallapuram jile ke cherani gaanv sthit satyasarani trust ke parisar main mili
 When he was asked to appear in the High Court on 15 July, he expressed his desire to adopt Islam
 adaalat ne use ek hostel main rakhane kaa nirdesh diya
 On August 5, when she appeared again in court, she said that she wanted to return to her parents
 in dharmantarit logon main se ab tak bahut kam hi log ies se jude nikle hai
 But due to some of them becoming part of the sleeper cell, the security agencies have lost sleep
 suraksha adhikariyon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki dharmantaran ke jitne maamle saamne aae hai, hakeekat main unki sankhya adhik ho sakati he
 Officials say that neo-salafism, which promotes Islam which is revengeful, has taken root in the state
 khud ko 'dammaj salphi' kehane vaale ek samooh ne mallapuram ke nilambur main apni alahada duniya basaa rakhi he
 Like the Amish, a conservative Christian community in America, they lead primitive lives away from modern technology
 laapata 'iageies 21' ke paanch sadsy isi vichaardhaara ko maanane vaale the or unhone srilanka ke ek salphi centre se dharmik shiksha bhi le rakhi thi
 a worrying aspect is that most of the newly-converted people are from well-to-do families and have professional degrees or are studying in professional colleges
 police kaa kahana he ki 'iageies 21' kii jaanch-padtaal ke dauraan use nish of truth, pis ajukeshan foundation or jakir nike ke islamic research foundation (iaref) jaise sanghathanon kii aad main dharmantaran karvaa rahe network kii jaankaree mili
 Incidentally, 3
 33 karod kii aabaadi vaale is rajya main musalmaan 26
 56 per cent and conversion is not a new thing here
 lekin police kaa kahana he ki ye nae sanghathan dharmantaran ke khel ko zyada chaturaai se khel rahe hai
 They are knowledgeable about technology and target women of other religions studying in professional colleges with the intention of recruiting people in their organization
 ek varisht police adhikari kehete hai, ''nimisha, marine jaikab or aparnaa vijayan jaisi haal kii ghatnaayen 'campus bharrti' ke ek pattern ko dikhaati hai, jinamein shikshit isai or hindu mahilaon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 The Satyasarni Trust caught sight of the police recently when 21-year-old Aparna Vijayan, daughter of a widowed defense officer, went missing from her hostel in Thiruvananthapuram
 usne islam apana liya tha or naam badalakar shahana rakh liya tha
 He was also married to Siad, who runs an autorickshaw
 uski maa mini vijayan kii shikaayat ke baad 30 march ko bandi pratyakshikaran yachika (habius corpus) ke tahat aparnaa adaalat main pesh hui
 She was accompanied by Sumaiya, who works in Satyasarni
 aparnaa ne bataaya ki usne apni marji se dharm badla he
 Director of the Sathyasarni Trust and Islamic scholar T
 abdul rahamaan bakawi sanstha kaa kisi bhi gaiyrkanoonee gatividhi se judaav hone se inkaar karte hai
 Talking to India Today, he said, "we work within the legal framework and are ready to investigate any government agency
" agar ham dharm kaa prachaar karte bhi hai to isamen kya galat he? hamaara samvidhan abhivyakti or kisi bhi dharm ko maanane kii aazaadee detaa he
 The organization has a strong claim team of 500 volunteers in Kerala
 trust kii website kahati he ki unka sanghathan nav-dharmantariton kaa bhaavnaatmak or saamaajik taur par samarthan karata he
 According to Bakwi, they only convert such people, who come to them on their own with proper documents
 haalanki police isse sahamat nahin
 "the conversion is being done by a group, which is part of a global network," says a police officer

 He wrote, 'I spoke to Jaswant Singh

 ’ During the cold weather, our skin starts dry and cracked due to the dry winds
 isliye thand ke mausam main sehat ke saath hamaari skin ko bhi khaas dekhbhaal kii jarurat hoti he
 In winter, people take many measures to avoid the cold, but do not pay attention to their skin, which completely ends the softness of the skin

 apane baalo ko mulaayam or chamakdaar banane ke liye nariyal ke tel ko garm kar ke apane baalo main maalish karen
 After this, cover your hair with the help of plastic bags or towels
 kuch samay baad baalo ko wash kar len
 Lip Balm: In the winter season, apply coconut oil on your lips before sleeping at night
 aap dekhenge ki subah hone tak aapke hont bilkul komal ho jaaenge
 You can also use coconut oil instead of lip balm during the day
 mechap removal:aapako shaayad yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki nariyal kaa tel mechap chhudaane ke liye sabase sasta or aasaan upaay he
 Cleansing makeup with coconut oil completely cleanses the chemical from your skin and also moisturizes your skin
 glo:agar aap bhi sardi main rukhi sukhi skin ke kaaran ghar se baahar nikalne se kataraate hai to pareshaan hona chhod den
 Rather, apply coconut oil on your face before leaving the house

 Relief from dark spots: Applying lemon juice mixed with coconut oil daily enhances the complexion as well as relieves black spots

 In between taking photographs by photographers, she turned to Rahul Gandhi, who was not coming in the picture
 jab rahul frem main aa gaye, tab hi sonia muskaraayi
 Sonia Gandhi is not the only one looking for Rahul
 pichhlaa haftaa party ke liye mushkil bharaa rahaa he
 The central government is wavering
 lekin rahul gandhi kuch karte nahin dikh rahe
 Rahul is the same person who is indicated to take over the leadership of the party in the near future
 ve sahyogi dalon se baat karne yaa sankat dur karne ke liye saamne nahin aae
 One reason for this is that apart from Omar Abdullah, he is not close to anyone else in the allies
 iske thik ulat sonia sahyogi dalon ke netaaon se aasaani se ghanishthata kaayam kar leti hai
 Even when Mamata Banerjee announced her withdrawal of support from the UPA-2 government, she did not delay to add that there would be no 'change' in her 'personal relations' with the Congress president
 jabaki rahul ne berukhi dikhaate hue 20 sitambar ko bharat band ke din dilli main yojit apane saptahik janata darbar ko roak diya
 On September 13, Rahul told reporters in Amethi that he would soon be playing a big role
 lekin maujuuda sankat se unki tarakkee main deree ho sakati he
 According to a senior party general secretary, 'mother and son will decide when it will happen
 ham ab bhi nahin jaanate hai ki unhen koun-sa pad diya jayega, lekin sabhi mahasachiv unke maatahat hi honge
 Meanwhile, Rahul remains a mysterious personality
 congressi is baat ko lekar bhi bhramit hai ki rahul khudara kaarobaar main epadi kaa samarthan karte hai yaa nahin
 Since the defeat in Uttar Pradesh elections, Rahul has kept a constant silence
 sarkaar ne jab 13 sitambar ko dijal kii keemat main badhotaree kii ghoshnaa kii tab ve amethi ke daure par the
 People of his parliamentary constituency surrounded him in Munshiganj guesthouse against this increase
 tivi par upie ke sahyogi dal sarkaar kii aalochana kar rahe the, lekin rahul upie ke bachaav main saamne nahin aae
 If Rahul should learn one lesson from his recent Amethi tour, it is that his silence cannot remain mysterious for long
 isaki jagah isse keval logon main unke khilaaf dhire-dhire paidaa ho rahaa gussa or kuntha hi badhegi
 During the inauguration of a branch of UCO Bank in Bhadar, Uttar Pradesh on 13 September, some people started shouting slogans in protest

" ’’ is 60 varshiya kisaan ne kaha ki pados ke rampur khaas main sadaken yahaan se acchhee hai
 Whenever Rahul is in Amethi, he puts up the 'janata Darbar' in the Munshiganj guest house, but its charm is dying out because people are hearing less later

 During a campaign for the Assam elections in April 2011, he found a group of youth complaining that the youth of the Northeast are discriminated against in terms of jobs in Delhi
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 i see a large number of people from the Northeast in the hospitality business
 ’’ yah sapaat bayaan tha, lekin shaayad un yuvaaon ne isaki ummid nahin kii thi
 Similarly, during the election campaign in Chhattisgarh in 2007, a villager from Bastar requested him to install more hand pumps in the area
 lekin sidhe iskaa vaada kar dene kii jagah unhone kaha, ‘‘pehle mujhe yah pataa karne dijie ki aapke gaanv kaa jalastr is baat kii ijaajat detaa he yaa nahin
 "the people of Amethi claim that a board has been installed in their Delhi Parliamentary constituency office," No job, no transfer
 ’ is par kisi ko shikaayat ho sakati he, yah rahul kii khyaati kaa hissaa he
 Rahul's style of functioning outside of Amethi remains a mystery

 kareeb dedh saal tak kanoon ke liye chhalaava bane dilli ke sabase bade gangster niraj bavana ko aakhirkaar dilli police ne giraftaar kar liya
 Actually, this gangster's arrest was based on tremendous intelligence news
 police ko khabar thi ki dilli kaa ye most vanted don raat ke andhere main apane gharavaalon se milane bavana pahunch saktaa he
 And the input was so accurate that the police had the make and even the registration number of Bawana's car
 'oparation bavana' ko aisa diya gaya anjamainput ke aadhaar par aanan-fanan main dilli police kii sabase elite force yani special cell 'oparation bavana' ko anjaam dene kii taiyaari main lag jaati he

 This car reaches here and turns towards Karimuddinagar via ranikheda-karala road
 lekin chand meter kaa faasla tay karte hi special cell ke tej tarraar officer car ko gher lete hai
 He is prompted to stop, but here he is, as is often the case on such occasions

 \ But after a brief cross-firing, that person would have been killed by the Delhi Police, the smartest police force in the country that has been looking for the last 18 months
 ji haa, ye shaks he niraj saharaavat urf niraj bavana
 Delhi's biggest gangster
 haal ke dinon main ye dilli police kii sabase badi kamyaabiyon main se ek he
 The reason is that Neeraj Bawana is the last link of the triangular gang war in Delhi, which was roaming freely on the streets till now
 lekin ab is gangster kii giraftaar ke saath hi dilli police raahat kii saans le sakati he, kyonki is gangvaar ke do or sire yani nitu dabodia gang kaa gangster paras urf goldi or rajesh urf karambir gang kaa sargana rajesh pehle se hi salaakhon ke peeche he

 He searches for such a person everywhere, but no one can tell when this search will be completed
 agar aasapane liye jindagibhar saath nibhaane vaale saathi kii talash kar rahe hanto aapke liye sabase pehle ye jaananaa bahut jaruri he ki aapako kaisaa partner chahie
 Once you have decided your thinking, it will be very easy to find that person
 ho saktaa he ki aapkaa partner aapke saamne hi ho lekin aap hi use pahchaan nahin paa rahe hon
 In such a situation, these tips can prove to be very useful for you: 1
 college yaa skool menye wo pehali jagah hoti haijahaan ek shaks kisi ke prati aakarshan mahasoos karata he
 But it is not necessarily only a crush
 ho saktaa he jis ladke yaa ladki ko aap pasand kar rahe hai, vahi aapkaa sachcha partner ho
 2
 mandir menye wo sabase jagah ho sakati he jahaan aapako aapkaa life partner mil jaae
 This does not mean that you should chase every person who comes to the temple
 3
 In the train, you must have seen many Bollywood love stories starting in the train
 ho saktaa he ki aap bhi kabhi akele safar kar rahe hon or aapako aapkaa solmet mil jaae

 agar aap kisi shaks se soshal media par milte hai or wo aapako pasand aata he to sabase pehle use puri tarah jaanane kii koshish kiijie
 Only when you are fully confident about it, move the matter forward
 5
 Nowhere else is there as much hope to find a perfect partner in ceremonies
 acchhee baat ye hoti he ki jis bhi shaks ko aap apane liye chunate hai use aapke parivaar vaale bhi jaanate hote hai
 In such a situation, you also get the support of the elders
 6
 In the gym, you must have seen many movies in which boys and girls meet while training in the gym and fall in love with them
 ho saktaa he ki aapako aapkaa partner bhi gym main hi mil jaae
