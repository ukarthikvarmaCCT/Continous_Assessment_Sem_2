 Congress general secretary, former minister and MP from Mumbai, Gurdas Kamat, described Narendra Modi as a monster and said that he breaks the temple, not builds it
 kaamat mangalvaar ko surat ke science centre main congressi kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He said that politics of hate of Modi will not work
 kaamat ke mutabik narendra modi jhooth bolte hai
 He talks of rebuilding the Kedarnath temple, but the truth is that he has broken more than three hundred temples in Ahmedabad and Gandhi Nagar
 modi par nafrat kii raajnneeti karne kaa iljaam lagaate hue kaamat bole, ki godhra cond ke baad jo hua, uske liye desh ke hindu modi ko kabhi maaf nahin karenge
 Kamat said that not only the country, Modi also divided the party and its alliance
 unheen ke chalate jediu alag ho gai or bijepi main bhi foot pad chuki he
 Commenting on Modi's charisma, Kamat said that even though the BJP would raise his name everywhere, the truth is that Modi has no influence outside Gujarat
 log unke rang dhang jaanate hai or bahekaave main aane vaale nahin hai
 You may find it a bit strange to hear, but this incident is absolutely true
 aapane shaayad hi kabhi aisa suna hogi ki 'pradhanmantri' bakrii charaane gaye hai or 'raashtrapati' kheton main pani de rahe hai
 But today something similar happens in the village we are going to talk about
 bataa den, rajasthan ke bundi jile main padane vaale is ramnagar gaanv main pradhanmantri or raashtrapati ke alaava yahaan rajyapal kanche khelte hai to ek tuuti bandook ke liye colector aapas main bhide rahete hai
 But after knowing why and how all this happens here, you will definitely be surprised once
 media report ke anusaar kareeb 500 aabaadi vaale ramnagar gaanv main zyaadaatar kanjar or mongia samudaay ke log rahete hai
 In this village, people name their children after government posts, institutions and celebrities
 in naamon main rajyapal, raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, semsung, andrid, sim card, chip, jioni, missd kol, or hai court jaise ajeebogareeb naam shaamil hai
 According to the media report, most people in this village are illiterate and these names are very popular among them
 yahaan par 50 saal ke ek vyakti kaa naam colector he, lekin yah baat alag he ki colector ne aaj tak skool kaa cheharaa tak nahin dekha he
 People here, after being influenced by the posts of officers, often name their children IG, SP, Havildar and Magistrate
 is ajeeb rivaaj ke peeche judi kahani bhi kam anuthi nahin he
 It is said that about 50 years ago, the then District Collector came to inspect the village
 unke rutabe se gaanv kii ek vruddh mahila itani prabhavit hui ki vah apane pote ko colector naam se hi bulaane lagi
 What was there! Since then, these people have made a practice of giving such names to their children
 haalanki yah baat or he ki 50 saal kaa yah colector kabhi skool nahin gaya
 The comments yahaan tak ki is gaanv main hoicourt naam kaa bhi ek vyakti rahata he
 It is said that when he was born, his grandfather was granted bail in a case by the High Court
 bas phir kya tha, us bachche kaa naam hoicourt rakh diya gaya
 Not only this, a family in the village has a great affection for the Congress
 jaahir he ki us ghar ke bacchon ke naam sonia, rahul or priyanka rakhe gaye hai
 Like Ramnagar, in another village Nainwa of Bundi, children are given strange names
 fark sirf itnaa he ki yahaan ke log prashasan kii bajaay unnat takneekon ke kaayal hai
 The people of Maungia and Banjara community living here have named their children on mobile brands and accessories
 yahi kaaran hai ki yahaan sim card ko pedo se jhulate or miss-kol ko aksar haathon main gulel liye imaliyaan todate dekha ja saktaa he
 According to media reports, Ramnagar village, with a population of about 500, is mostly inhabited by Kanjar and Mongia communities
 is gaanv main log apane bacchon ke naam sarkari padon, sansthaaon or hastiyon ke naam par rakhte hai
 These names include strange names like Governor, President, Prime Minister, Samsung, Android, SIM card, Chip, Gionee, missed call, and High Court
 media main ai report kii maane to is gaanv main zyaadaatar log anpadh hai or inke bich ye naam kaaphi prachlit hai
 Here a 50-year-old man is named collector, but it is different that the collector has not seen the face of the school till date
 yahaan ke log adhikariyon kii padon se prabhavit hokar aksar apane bacchon ke naam aiji, espi, hawaldaar or magistrate rakh lete hai
 The story behind this strange custom is no less unique
 bataaya jaataa he ki takreeban 50 saal pehle tatkaaleen jila-colector gaanv kaa muyna karne aae
 An old lady of the village was so impressed by her status that she started calling her grandson by the name of Collector
 bas phir kya tha! tabhi se in logon ne apane bacchon ko is tarah ke naam dene kii reet bana lee
 However, it is another matter that this 50 year old collector never went to school
 tippaniyan Even a person named High Court lives in this village
 kehete hai ki jab uskaa janm hua to uske dada ko hoicourt ne ek maamle main jamaanat di thi
 What was it then, that child was named High Court

 ram mandir ke andolan main vihip sabase sakriy sanghathan rahaa he
 VHP working president Alok Kumar made it clear that his organization was not willing to wait indefinitely on the construction of Ram temple and the organization remembered his promise to the Narendra Modi government within the first month of the second term of the NDA government
 Have decided to get it done
 unhone ieenes ko bataaya, "ek baat saaf he, vihip do muddon par samjhauta nahin karegi - pehla, bhagwaan ram ke janmasthan par sirf mandir banegaa or doosraa, ayodhya kii saanskrithik simaaon ke bheetar koi masjid nahin ho sakati
 "will remind Modi
 The chairman of the Promise VHP said that the guiding committee of the organization will meet in Haridwar on June 19-20 to discuss the issue and pass a resolution which will be submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vihip netaa ne kaha, "ham ek prastaav paarit karenge or ise pradhanmantri ko denge, ham unhen yaad dilaayenge ki aapke ghoshnaa patr main ram mandir nirmaan kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 "the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya has been one of the top issues on the bjp's agenda and has been mentioned in all the party manifestos for the Lok Sabha elections

 The VHP leader also said that since the government took office just a few days ago, there is a need to be patient
 lekin jab is baat kaa zikr kiya ki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki ram mandir kaa intjaar teen dashakon se ho rahaa he, jisamen modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal ke 5 saal bhi shaamil hai to unhone palatakar jawaab dete hue kaha, "ab nahin karenge

 Work on the Ram temple will start within one and a half years, i am not speculating but as a knowledgeable person

 He also saw the progress being made in agriculture there and told how Modi along with the progress of industries also encouraged farming

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal haryana main chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 In March 2018, Kejriwal is going to hold a big rally in Hisar
 yahaan wo aagaamee chunaav kaa bigul fookenge
 The party has also made a plan to vote for Delhi by counting the functioning of Delhi in Haryana
 arvind kejariwal ne haryana ke agarwal samaaj or vahaan ke vyapaariyon se haryana chunaav ke liye taiyaar hone kii apil kii he
 Kejriwal said that i am duty of all people in Haryana
 aglaa chunaav haryana kaa ladanaa he or aam aadmi party kaa jhanda vahaan gaadna he
 Apparently, despite being in power in Delhi, the ACD that failed in the 2017 MCD elections has made a big announcement in 2018
 haryana main raajnneetik jameen talashne ke liye aam aadmi party loksabhaa, vidhansabha or jila adhyaksh ke alaava 200 logon kii ek team kii jald hi badi baithak karne ja rahi he
 This team will prepare a strategy for the rally and campaign of Arvind Kejriwal before the elections in Haryana
 isse pehle aap ne haryana ke 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main hissaa liya tha lekin 10 loksabhaa siton par kamyaabi haath nahin lagi thi
 'haryana's law has broken down, lawmaker Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta said while talking to' Aaj Tak 'that the roots of Vaishya and Agarwal society are inside Haryana
 haryana ke andar kanoon vyavastha charmara chuki he
 There are increasing cases of rape but the Chief Minister has failed to provide security there
 logon kaa moh congress se hat chukaa tha, bijepi se koi chamatkaar nahin hua
 So now people want change there
 main haryana kaa rahane vaala hum agar mujhe party koi jimmedaari degi to vahaan main badhachadhakar kaam karuunga
 Kejriwal Gupta will hold a big rally in Hisar, told that the party will try the Delhi model in Haryana
 unke mutabik, haryana main kisaan pareshaan rahete hai
 While the crop is wasted in Delhi, the highest compensation is paid to the farmer
 kejariwal dilli kaa yahi model ab haryana tak lekar jaaenge or 24- 25 march ko hisar main raily karenge
 Let us know that after taking power in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party had tried in the Punjab Assembly, Goa Assembly, Delhi MCD and Uttar Pradesh Corporation elections but no major success was achieved

 Senior Congress leader Narayan Dutt (ND) Tiwari used to be the Governor of Andhra Pradesh during those days

 diene test ke baad mila parivarandhra pradesh se lautne ke baad endi tiwari uttarakhand or uttar pradesh kii sakriy raajnneeti apni jameen talash hi rahe the ki ek nai musiibat saamne aa gai
 Known for his colorful mood in his younger days, ND was accused by a woman

 The matter reached the court on nd's refusal

 seemandhra ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke faisle ke baad bihar main raajnneeti garma gai he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has appealed to the public to stop Bihar on March 1, then after that the BJP did not delay the announcement of blocking the train on February 28
 donon kii naaraazgi kendra ke ravaiye ko lekar he
 Seemandhra got special state status in a day, while Bihar has tried it on many levels for the last several years, but no hearing
 khaskar nitish kumaar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye lagaataar koshish karte rahe hai
 The BJP has been talking about a special package, not for a particular state
 lekin ab rajnatik paristhiti badalane se usne bhi sur badal liye hai
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has expressed deep displeasure at the Center's discriminatory attitude
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki kendra manamaane dhang se ek din main simandhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja de rahi he, jabaki bihar pichley dedh saal se vishesh rajya ke darje ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, uski andekhi kii ja rahi he
 Announcing the closure of entire Bihar on 1 March against this arbitrariness of the Center, Nitish Kumar said that now he will not sit silent
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye unhone 1 karod 18 logon kaa hastakshar abhiyaan chalaaya
 Performed rights rallies in Patna and Delhi
 kendra ne isaki samiksha ke liye raghuram rajan cameti banaai
 Although he did not agree with the committee's recommendation, yet he was ready to give Bihar a special state status on the basis of backwardness
 lekin kendra ne apane sahyogiyon ke kehane par ise thande baste main daal diya
 Not only this, Finance Minister p Chidambaram had in last year's budget speech and economic survey discussed giving special status to Bihar
 raghuram rajan cameti kii report ko vitt mantri ne khud saarvajanik kiya
 But the meeting with the Finance Secretary, to be held on 26 November 2013, was abruptly canceled
 uske baad bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene par koi charchaa nahin hui
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave special state status to Seemandhra in one day at the behest of Sonia Gandhi
 bihar pichhada he, desh ke anupaat main teji se chalane ke baavjood ise 25 varshon kaa samay lagegaa barabari tak aane main
 In such a situation, when Bihar fulfills all the criterias to get the status of a special state, why not make it a special state? To protest on this issue, work will be stopped in Bihar on March 1
 nitish kumaar ne bihar kii janata se apil kii vah is din koi kaam na kare or apana virodh kendra ke prati jaahir kare
 On the other hand, just after the Bihar Chief Minister announced the Bihar bandh, the BJP also announced to block the train on February 28 in Bihar on the issue of special state
 haalanki bijepi ne vishesh rajya ke mudde kii bajaae vishesh package kii maang hameshaa karti rahi he, lekin ab jabaki simandhra ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mil rahaa he or nitish kumaar ne is mudde ko pehle hi hathiyaa liya he, bijepi ke paas vishesh rajya kii maang kaa samarthan karne ke alaava or koi rasta nahin he
 BJP is accusing Nitish Kumar that when the matter of special state status was passed with the support of all parties from both houses of Bihar Legislature, then why did Nitish Kumar make this issue only of JDU? Senior BJP leader and Leader of Opposition in the Legislature, Sushil Kumar Modi, expressed displeasure over the Centre's policy of discrimination, saying that Nitish Kumar is seeking the status of a special state to Bihar on the basis of this Congress
 unhone daawa kiya ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja keval bijepi hi dilaa sakati he

 Taking a major step, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the Master Plan 2020 possible amendments

 There is a lot of resentment among the traders about this decision of the Supreme Court, whether the despotic merchant government, whether it is from Delhi or at the Center, is cursing it

 Khan Market Association president Sanjeev Mehra says this is incorrect

 We have been treated like this since the beginning
 vyapaaree agar nuksaan uthayega to isamen pradesh or desh kii bhi pragati rukegi
 Efforts are already being made to harass the traders and our matter was not properly kept in the court, due to which the Supreme Court had to take such a drastic step

 Ceiling havoc can fall on every small and big market of Delhi at any time

 This is the third time Narendra Modi has worn victory in Gujarat
 'india shining' ke baad bhartiya loktantr ne ek baar se phir se sabit kiya he ki uske liye kisi tarah ke khaas media abhiyaan koi matlab nahin rakhte
 If we look closely, there are many signs of future in this victory
 gujarat main 'modi magic' ke alaava ni:andeh kai or karkon ne bhi kaam kiya he lekin vikaas ke mudde kii ahmiyat or bhrashtachar rahit prashasan dene main modi ko mili safalataa ne logon ko 'man' banane main zyada mushkil nahin aane di
 Struggling with its own setbacks, the main opposition party, the Congress, was seen playing a protective manner in every round of the contest
 keshubhai patel kii gujarat parivartan party sambhavat: sirf 'modi virodh' ke liye hi ladati najar ai
 Now that the elections have been held in Gujarat and Modi has become the incumbent, it is time to discuss how this victory of Modi will affect the national politics
 jaisaa ki pehle yah kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki is jeet se modi ke liye dilli ke raste khulenge
 
 
 Now perhaps this debate will get more strength
 
 
 ki modi bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar banenge yaa nahin
 
 
 
 ek najar se dekhen to modi ke liye yah bada mushkil kaam he
 The current politics of the country is attributed to UPA and NDA
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf bani modi kii chhavi endie ke ghatak dalon ko vipareet disha main khinchegi
 But the question is also how much the other parties will support the Congress due to its fast-paced image and its inability to establish a true definition of future leadership
 
 
 
 In such a situation, a weak possibility is also formed of the Third Front, but in view of the mutual pull of small political parties, the possibility of this seems really very 'weak'
 
 
 
 So it seems more likely that political parties should be polarized and new definitions of NDA and UPA should be made
 yadi aisa hua to modi ke pradhanmantri banane kii raah 'thodi' aasaan ho sakati he
 
 
 Because if left with the political parties of the north, some parties of the south can join the NDA
 khaskar dakshin ke ve dal jinke liye hindu-muslim raajnneeti koi khaas mahatv nahin rakhti
 Secondly, if this does not happen and the BJP falls apart, then it is likely to go with the traditional political allies in the election arena
 or tab bijepi sambhavat: apane puraane muddon ke saath raajnneetik akhaade main kudane kaa man bana sakati he
 Of course, the issue of development may also come up on its agenda
 haalanki is baat kii koi guarantee nahin ki gujarat main vikaas kaa mudda chal gaya he to baaki ke desh main bhi is masale par vot pad jaaenge
 
 
 
 or gujarat kii raajnneeti ke chashme se desh kii raajnneeti ko dekhnaa atishyokti bhi hoga
 
 
 Even then this situation will be beneficial for Narendra Modi
 duusari ore, yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii andruni khinchataan modi ke raste main pathar ban sakati he lekin gujarat chunaavon main mili jeet se party ke bheetar unke virodhiyon ke hausale post hi honge
 The comments yadi sab kuch aise hi rahaa or janata ne koi 'chaunkaane' vaala parinaam nahin diya to paristhitiyaan narendra modi ke paksh main ja sakati hai
 If all these possibilities are kept within a scope, then the thought becomes easier for Modi and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections can be Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi
 
 
 
 And if he is successful in becoming the Prime Minister, then it will be a matter of looking at the politics of the country
 gujarat main 'modi magic' ke alaava ni:andeh kai or karkon ne bhi kaam kiya he lekin vikaas ke mudde kii ahmiyat or bhrashtachar rahit prashasan dene main modi ko mili safalataa ne logon ko 'man' banane main zyada mushkil nahin aane di
 Struggling with its own setbacks, the main opposition party, the Congress, was seen playing a protective manner in every round of the contest

 Now perhaps this debate will get more strength
 
 
 ki modi bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar banenge yaa nahin
 
 
 
 ek najar se dekhen to modi ke liye yah bada mushkil kaam he
 The current politics of the country is attributed to UPA and NDA
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf bani modi kii chhavi endie ke ghatak dalon ko vipareet disha main khinchegi
 But the question is also how much the other parties will support the Congress due to its fast-paced image and its inability to establish a true definition of future leadership
 
 
 
 In such a situation, a weak possibility is also formed of the Third Front, but in view of the mutual pull of small political parties, the possibility of this seems really very 'weak'
 
 
 
 So it seems more likely that political parties should be polarized and new definitions of NDA and UPA should be made
 yadi aisa hua to modi ke pradhanmantri banane kii raah 'thodi' aasaan ho sakati he
 
 
 Because if left with the political parties of the north, some parties of the south can join the NDA
 khaskar dakshin ke ve dal jinke liye hindu-muslim raajnneeti koi khaas mahatv nahin rakhti
 Secondly, if this does not happen and the BJP falls apart, then it is likely to go with the traditional political allies in the election arena
 or tab bijepi sambhavat: apane puraane muddon ke saath raajnneetik akhaade main kudane kaa man bana sakati he
 Of course, the issue of development may also come up on its agenda
 haalanki is baat kii koi guarantee nahin ki gujarat main vikaas kaa mudda chal gaya he to baaki ke desh main bhi is masale par vot pad jaaenge
 
 
 
 or gujarat kii raajnneeti ke chashme se desh kii raajnneeti ko dekhnaa atishyokti bhi hoga
 
 
 Even then this situation will be beneficial for Narendra Modi
 duusari ore, yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii andruni khinchataan modi ke raste main pathar ban sakati he lekin gujarat chunaavon main mili jeet se party ke bheetar unke virodhiyon ke hausale post hi honge
 The comments yadi sab kuch aise hi rahaa or janata ne koi 'chaunkaane' vaala parinaam nahin diya to paristhitiyaan narendra modi ke paksh main ja sakati hai
 If all these possibilities are kept within a scope, then the thought becomes easier for Modi and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections can be Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi
 
 
 
 And if he is successful in becoming the Prime Minister, then it will be a matter of looking at the politics of the country
 apni khud kii banaai mushkilon se juujhati mukhya vipakshi party congress mukaable ke har daur main surakshatmak tareeke se khelti najar ai
 Keshubhai Patel's Gujarat Parivartan Party was probably seen fighting only for 'modi opposition'
 ab jabaki gujarat main chunaav ho gaya he or modi gaddinshin ho gaye hai to vakt he is baat kii charchaa kaa ki modi kii is jeet se rashtriya raajnneeti par kya asar padegaa
 As earlier it was being speculated that this victory would open the way for Delhi to Modi
 
 
 ab shaayad is bahes ko or zyada bal milegaa
 
 
 Whether Modi will become bjp's prime ministerial candidate or not
 
 
 
 At a glance, it is a difficult task for Modi
 desh kii vartmaan raajnneeti upie ore endie ke hawaale he
 Modi's image against Muslims will pull the NDA constituents in the opposite direction
 lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki congress kii teji se giri chhavi or bhavishya ke netritv kii sahi paribhaasha garh paane main naakamayaabi ke chalate duusare dal uskaa kitna saath denge
 
 
 
 aise main ek ksheen sambhaavna tisare morche kii bhi banati he lekin chote raajnneetik dalon kii aapasi khinchataan ko dekhte hue isaki sambhaavna vastav main bahut 'ksheen' najar aati he
 
 
 
 to zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii najar aati he ki raajnneetik dalon kaa nayaa dhruvikaran ho or endie tathaa upie kii nai paribhaasha bane
 If this happens, then the path of Modi becoming Prime Minister may be 'slightly' easier
 
 
 kyonki uttar ke raajnneetik dalon kaa saath chhod dene par dakshin ke kuch dal endie se jud sakate hai
 Particularly those parties of the South for whom hindu-muslim politics does not matter
 duusare, yadi aisa na ho sakaa or bijepi alag-thalag padi to uski sambhaavna chunaav ke maidan main paaramparik raajnneetik saathiyon ke saath hi jane kii banati he
 And then the BJP may possibly decide to jump into the political arena with its old issues
 ni:andeh haalia haath laga vikaas kaa mudda bhi uske agenda main upar aa saktaa he
 However, there is no guarantee that the issue of development has gone on in Gujarat, then the rest of the country will also vote on this issue
 
 
 
 And it will also be an exaggeration to see the politics of the country from the prism of Gujarat politics
 
 
 to bhi yah sthiti narendra modi ke liye laabhprad hogi
 On the other hand, it is also being said that the internal infighting of the BJP could become a stonewall in Modi's way, but the victory in the Gujarat elections will only overwhelm his opponents within the party
 tippaniyan If everything remains the same and the public has not given any 'shocking' result then the circumstances may go in favor of Narendra Modi
 in sab sambhaavnaaon ko ek daayre main rakhkar yadi sochaa jaae to modi ke liye rasta sugam banataa he or saal 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 
 or yadi vah pradhanmantri banane main safal ho jate hai to desh kii raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi yah dekhne vaali baat hogi

 In such a situation, there is also a possibility that after Alpesh Thakor, Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani support the Congress on a half-year basis, then some of the candidates supporting them should also enter the electoral fray
 rahul ke daure par ho sakati he charchadusri taraf congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ek baar phir gujarat daure par ja rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi will be on a Gujarat tour from November 1 to 3 for the third leg of the Navsarjan Yatra
 1 november ko rahul jambusar main jansabha kar yatra shuru karenge
 After this, on 2 November, Vyara, Vasada, Vapi, Valsad, Nana will visit Pauda
 jabaki antim din 3 november ko surat main jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 Rahul will visit Unai Mata after the visit
 mana ja rahaa he ki rahul ke is daure tak congress ko milane vaale yuva samarthan par bhi pikchar clear ho jaaegi
 On this tour, a meeting between Rahul and Hardik Patel is also possible
 jisamen rahul aarakshan ke mudde par hardik patel se koi vaada kar sakate hai
 Because Hardik has given the Congress till 7 November to clear the stand on reservation
 aise main congress ke kendriya netritv ke liye tikat par sambhavit takaraav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue use antim rup dena bhi behad mushkil hone vaala he
 Assembly elections are to be held in two phases in Gujarat on 9 and 14 December
 pehle charan ke liye 9 disambar ko 19 jilon kii 89 siton par matdaan hoga
 Whereas under the second phase, voting will be held on December 14 on 93 seats in 14 districts
 chunaav nattejey 18 disambar ko ghoshit kiye jaaenge

 The biggest challenge for the Commission is the increase in the names of fake and duplicate voters in the voter lists from the Congress Election Commission
 congresane saath hi 2019 loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye matdaanaptr (ballat) vyavastha par lautne kii maang kii he
 The main opposition party Congress has also demanded to keep a close watch on the extent of election spending of candidates and political parties
 bataa den ki chunaav ayog ne aagaamee loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenjar shuddhta, paardarshita ormatadaata soochiyonki samaveshita behatar banane ke liye kadam uthaane ko sabhi raajnneetik dalon se suzav aamantrit kiye hai
 Congress general secretary-in-charge (organization) Ashok Gehlot has sent opinion on behalf of the party to the Election Commission
 gahalot ne likhit main jawaab main kaha he ki chunaav ayog ke saamne sabase badi chunauti matadaata soochiyon main farji or dupliket votaron ke naamon kaa badhanaa he
 Gehlot has written- “surprising revelations are coming out and this is happening from the root of the electoral process
 mukt or nishpaksh chunaav ke liye loktantr kii ridh maani jane vaaleen matadaata soochiyon kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par hai
 The first challenge is to curb such efforts towards changing and distorting the outcome of the electoral process
 agar mattaadaa soochiyon kaa uchit bhautik satyaapan nahin karaayaa gaya or matadaata soochiyon main badi sankhya main bogus matadaataaon ko agar bane rahane diya gaya to ye chunavi prakriya kii eemaandaaree se samjhauta karne jaisaa hoga”
 Apart from raising the issue of fake and duplicate voters in voter lists, the Congress has emphasized that it is the need of the hour to return to the ballot system
 congress ne apane jawaab main likhaa he- “loktantr kaa bhavishya loktantric prakriya or isaki swatantraaa ko lekar aasthaa par tikaa he
 It has recently been found that evms were flawed and not workable on many occasions
 aisi anek shikaayatein ain ki batan kahin dabaaya gaya or vot bijepi ke chunaav chihn camel ko hi gaya
 This has raised serious questions on the fairness, independence and reliability of evms
 adhik vvpats kaa istemaal nirarthak he agar paper trail ko gina hi nahin jaae
 Only a very small number of vvpats were crosschecked
 isse veriphication kii ye prakriya sirf academic eksrasij hi ban kar rah gai
 In such a situation, the Congress has a strong opinion that in the interest of freedom and integrity of the electoral process, the ballpaper system should be returned ”
 congress ne chunavi chande kii paardarshita ko lekar chunaav ayog se maang kii he ki elactoral bond kharidne vaale vyaktiyon or companiyon kii puri pahchaan ko saarvajanik kiya janaa chahie
 The Congress has written to the Election Commission - political transparency is the need of the hour and revealing the full identity of the purchase of electoral bonds is a necessary change that should be implemented
 abhi elactoral bonds ko lekar gumnami kaa upachaar kiya janaa chahie
 If this is not done, then there is a little transparency, it will also eliminate it
 congress ummidavaaron / raajnneetik dalon ke chunavi kharch kii seemaa par bhi sakht najar rakhane ke paksh main he
 The Congress has also condemned the bjp's current rule in its reply
 congress ne kaha he- “dhanabal ke dam par maujuuda sarkaar kaa prabhaav state mashinari ke istemaal main bad rahaa he
 There should be a limit on expenditure on advertisements, posters, hoardings of political parties either directly or indirectly, as well as the expenses of transportation like helicopters, private aircraft during election campaigns of political parties directly or indirectly

 An earthquake of magnitude 7 occurred
 udhar, pakistan or afghanistan main bhi bukamp se baari tabaahi hui he
 Although there is no news of loss of life or property in the country, but a large part of India is very sensitive to earthquake
 uttar bharat or purvottar bharat kaa zyaadaatar hissaa bukamp ke maamle main kaaphi khatarnaak mana jaataa he
 Himalayas are the cause of earthquake here
 himalay main chal rahi bhugarbheey hulchale bukamp aane kaa ek bada kaaran hai
 This is according to the theory of plate tectonic theoryplate tectonic, there is a collision between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate in the Himalayan region
 bhartiya plate urasian plate ke neeche ghus rahi he aurais vajah se is ilaake main bukamp aate rahete hai
 The high mountains of the Himalayas are the result of this collision
 bhartiya plate har saal jaati he nichebhartiya plate har saal 40 se 50 millimetre urasian plate ke neeche ghus jaati he
 This is the reason that the Himalayas are among the most active regions of the world in terms of earthquake
 do platon main chal rahi takkar pashchim main pakistan kii suleman range se lekar purvottar bharat main bharat-burma range he
 The earthquake in North India is due to the collision of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate, the region of the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers
 in donon nadiyon ke dakshin main sthit himalay kii oonchi chotiyaan hameshaa bukamp se hilti rahi hai
 Because of this, large earthquakes have occurred in North India

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Ayodhya on Wednesday after Kashi
 2014 main piem banane ke baad paanch saal main pehali baar modi bhagwaan ram kii nagari ayodhya pahunch rahe hai
 Though he will address the election rally in the sixth phase of the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, the political significance of the pm's visit to Ayodhya is being extracted
 kya is daure ke jariye modi sidhe sanket dena chaahate hai ki unke or unki party ke liye ayodhya mudda abhi khatm nahin hua he
 PM Narendra Modi will address an election public meeting between Ayodhya and Ambedkar Nagar on Wednesday in Maya Bazar area of gosainganj in Faizabad
 ayodhya se kareeb 25 kimi duuri par piem raily karenge
 Ayodhya comes under the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat

 Narendra Modi is rallying in Ayodhya before the fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki piem ke daure se bijepi ko ayodhya ke aas-paas kii siton par siyaasi phayda mil saktaa he
 Adjacent to Faizabad Lok Sabha constituency are Ambedkar Nagar, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Basti, Jaunpur and Pratapgarh seats, where voting is to be held in the sixth phase
 jabaki barabanki, baharich, kaisarganj or gonda jaisi siton par paanchaven charan main voting honi he
 In 2014, the BJP managed to win all these seats
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii chunauti se jujh rahi bijepi ko piem kii ayodhya raily se kaaphi ummiden laga rakhi hai
 In fact, since the formation of the government in UP, BJP has given political and social messages by organizing many big events in Ayodhya
 pichley do saal yogi sarkaar ne ayodhya main deepawali ke maukey par bhavy deepotsav kaa aayojan kar rahi he
 Simultaneously Faizabad was renamed Ayodhya
 ayodhya main bhagwaan ram kii badi pratimaa lagane ko bhi manjuuri di ja chuki he
 Ramayana Museum is being built
 lekin yah sansadeey seat abhi faijabad ke naam se jaani jaati he
 The Ayodhya dispute case is still going on in the Supreme Court
 ram mandir nirmaan kii maang ko lekar sadhu-sant modi-yogi sarkaar se kar rahe hai, lekin lambey arase se yah maamla adalati kaarywahi main ulajhaa hua he
 The Supreme Court bench has set up a committee of arbitrators to resolve the matter through dialogue with all the parties, who will discuss the matter with both the parties and report to the Supreme Court
 aise main agar madhyasthata se maamla nahin sulajhata he to supreme court maamle main antim faisla degaa
 On the issue of construction of Ram temple, Narendra Modi had said in an interview that in his manifesto we had said that this issue will be resolved in a constitutional manner
 kanoonee prakriya puri ho jane dijie
 After the end of this process, we are ready for whatever responsibility the government will have
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi piem ayodhya raily ko sambodhit karne gaye the
 After this, he is now going to the election rally once again after five years
 pichley paanch saal main piem rahete hue unhone ek baar bhi ayodhya kaa daura nahin kiya
 Lallu Singh of BJP is MP from Ayodhya Lok Sabha seat and the party has once again fielded him
 congress se purv pradesh adhyaksh nirmal khatri or sapa se anandasen yadav ummidavaar hai

 aisi khabar he
 Earlier this week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the government is investigating the Rs 13 crore deal between Chief Minister Raje's son Dushyant Singh and Lalit Modi and the government will run according to the rule of law
 sutara kah rahe hai ki ek taraf jahaan sarkari rukh yahi rahegaa, vahiin duusari taraf vah is deal ke tamaam kagajaton kii jaanch kar rahaa he ki raajnneetik taur par is deal kaa bachaav kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Now the party has decided that the party will defend this deal
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki kaagajon ke anusaar bijepi yah bataaegi ki 2007 main lalit modi ne teen karod kaa lone dushyant singh ko diya or jise ek check ke madhyam se 2009 main waapas kiya gaya
 There is no issue in this
 lekin, aakhir lalit modi ne dushyant kii company ke 10 rupee share kareeb ek lakh main kyon kharide ke mudde par party kaa yah kahana he ki raaje kii paitruk sampatti kareeb 300 karod rupee kii he or lalit modi ne unke ek share kii keemat kareeb ek lakh main rakh ke koi phayda nahin diya
 And it did not directly benefit the company
 tippaniyan However, in the returns given to the Income Tax Department in 2013, Raje's son showed the value of his fort at just Rs 16 crore and also said that it is not the name of his company but the names of his dependents
 vahiin, jab se yah poocha gaya ki kahin yah lalit modi kii morishas kii company kii avaidh kamai to nahin, is par bijepi ke sutron kaa kahana he ki yah jaanch kaa vishay he or mani londring kaa maamla lalit modi par banegaa or agar isamen koi doshi ho do vah lalit modi hoga

 Sources are saying that on one hand, while the government's position will remain the same, on the other hand it is examining all the documents of the deal whether it can be defended politically or not
 ab party ne yah tay kiya he ki party is deal kaa bachaav kar legi
 Sources are telling that according to the papers the BJP will state that in 2007, Lalit Modi gave a loan of three crore rupees to Dushyant Singh and returned in 2009 through a check
 isamen koi mudda nahin he
 But, on the issue of why Lalit Modi bought 10 shares of Dushyant's company for around one lakh, the party says that Raje's ancestral property is worth about Rs 300 crore and Lalit Modi has valued his one share at around one lakh
 i did not give any benefit by keeping it
 or isse company ko sidhe koi munafa nahin hua

 At the same time, since it was asked whether it is illegal money of Lalit Modi's company of Mauritius, BJP sources said that it is a matter of investigation and the case of money laundering will be made on Lalit Modi and if anyone is guilty in this Let it be Lalit Modi
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki kaagajon ke anusaar bijepi yah bataaegi ki 2007 main lalit modi ne teen karod kaa lone dushyant singh ko diya or jise ek check ke madhyam se 2009 main waapas kiya gaya

 a post shared by Mirzashireen (@shireenmirza) on Nov 26, 2017 at 4:15am PST The party's political proposal was passed at the Janata Dal United meeting in Delhi
 janata dal ne piem ummidavaari par bijepi ko disambar tak kii mohalat di he
 The proposal said that the BJP should announce the name of the prime ministerial contender by the end of this year
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki endie kii piem pratyaashee ghoshit karne kii parampara rahi he
 Therefore, this time it should be done the same
 iske alaava jadyu ke raajnneetik prastaav main kaha gaya he ki piem pratyaashee dharmanirpeksh chhavi kaa hona chahie
 Earlier, Janata Dal (united) President Sharad Yadav while addressing the party meeting said that the party has weakened after the merger with Samata Party and today it faces many challenges
 yadav ne kaha, 'har jagah or har vakt kai chunautiyaan hai
 We have not been able to take the party to where it should have reached
 'narendra modi kaa naam na lete hue yadav ne kaha ki ham siddhanton se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 He said that we are not opposed to any particular person
 lekin baat siddhanton kii he
 Sharad Yadav edified the leaders of his own party, KC Tyagi and Sabir Ali
 unhone kaha ki media se baatcheet karne waalon ko saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 Conflicting statements should be avoided
 gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko sabir ali ne bayaan diya tha ki agar bijepi modi ko piem ke rup main project karti he to unki party ke saath gathbandhan tut jayega
 Sharad Yadav said, 'don't be fond of coming on camera like that
 media main kuch bhi bolne se pehle baat karnaa chahie
 Sharad Yadav looked very angry with the leaders of his own party
 unhone kaha ki kal kuch aisa kaha gaya jo maine-nitish ne nahin kaha tha
 Principles are important to us, not individuals
 vaishvik bazaar main anya mudraon kii tulana main dollar kii majbootee se somvaar ko kachche tel kii keemten 99 dollar prati bairal se neeche aa gayi
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil contract for the month of June declined by 84 cents to 98
 81 dollar prati bairal par aa gaya
 It 99 on Friday
 65 dollar prati bairal par band hua tha
 Similarly, Brent crude oil's June deal fell by 44 cents to 113 at London's ICE Future Exchange
 39 bairal prati dollar par aa gaya
 It is noteworthy that at the beginning of this month, the price of crude oil reached the highest level of 30 months at $ 115 per barrel
 riterbush and associats ne ek rapat main kaha, kachche tel kii keemten lagaataar gir rahi hai
 We still see a stark contrast between the crude oil and the dollar
 dilli kii hawa main zehar ghul rahaa he, to ab metro logon ko is pradooshan se bachaane ke liye aage aadi he
 Delhi Metro has announced that it will introduce more train trips than normal days from Thursday, so that more people can travel in the metro and avoid getting exposed to open pollution on the road
 dilli metro guuruuvaar subah se hi trip main badhotaree karnaa shuru kar degi or dinabhar main pichley dinon ke mukaable 186 zyada train trip lagaaegi
 According to the spokesperson of Delhi Metro, on normal days the Metro makes 3131 trips, but now the number of these trips will be increased to 3317
 yahi nahin non peak avars main jin trainon ko sarvice se baahar kar diya jaataa he, unhen bhi sarvice main rakhaa jayega, taaki log aasaani se metro se yatra kar saken
 Talking about individual lines, a total of 22 rounds will be extended on the Gurgaon line
 pehle badali se gudgaanv ke bich 679 train trip hoti thim, lekin guuruuvaar se dinabhar main is line par 701 metro phere lagaaegi
 Similarly, there will be 20 additional trips on the dwarka-noida Vaishali route
 yahaan dinabhar main 752 kii jagah 772 phere honge
 The maximum trips will be extended on the mundka-inderlok line, here the 108 rounds of the metro will be increased throughout the day
 faridabad line 36 atirikt phere lagenge
 However, along with the Rohini Dilshad Garden line of the metro, the number of trips on the airport metro will remain the same as before
 dilli sarkaar ne skulon main chuttee ghoshit kii he, lekin jo log daftar jane vaale hai or jinhen dopahiyaa vaahanon yaa public transport se janaa hota he, wo pradooshan ke khatre se sabase zyada prabhavit rahenge
 Keeping this in mind, the metro has increased the number of trips, because the metro is a public transport in which people can travel in AC trains and during the journey they do not have to suffer from pollution
 maa ne 9 maheene tak use kokh main paala
 Everything was done, but now a strange statement not only left the family stunned, but the whole neighborhood spread like wildfire
 daawa hi kuch aisa he, jo bhi sune, to pehle yakeen na ho
 Even if the mind is understood, the heart is not ready to accept it
 bistar par padi rajani ne ek aisa daawa kiya he, jise sunne ke baad paas-pados ke log sann hai ki aakhir main aisa kaise hua? aapane kabhi dekha yaa suna he ki kokh kaa apharan hua he?bakaul brahma, aganbari main teacher unki patni rajani kaa 15 april ko apharan ho gaya, jab vah skool ke liye ja rahi thi
 As usual, she would return from school, but on April 15, when she did not return till noon, family members searched Rajni everywhere at relatives and nursing homes
 lekin jab vah nahin mili, to karaval nagar thane pahunche or soochna di
 Later, Rajni told the police that the two burkhed women kidnapped her and smelled some intoxicants
 yah sab kuch hua 15 april ko
 The next day, on April 16, when he regained consciousness, his womb mysteriously disappeared
 aarope he ki kokh se baccha kisi ne nikaal liya
 The police started investigating the story of the kidnapping of this peculiar womb in Roznamche
 ipisi kii dhara 365, 34, 317 or 363 ke tahat mukadmaa kaayam kar diya
 a shocking revelation was later revealed during the investigation
 police ko kuch aisi baat mili, jo kokh ke apharan kii is kahani ko kuch or hi disha de rahe the
 There were some questions which shocked the police
 rajani 15 april ko ghar se gaayab hui, to uskaa mobile phone ghar par hi kyon chhot gaya yaa phir jaanboojhkar usne choda gaya? ek garbhvatee mahila, jiske 9 maheene puure hone kii baat parijan kah rahe hai, use skool jane kii ijaajat kyon di gai? mahila ne gaayab hone se pehle apane kaanon ke kundal utarkar kyon ghar par rakhaa? ghatana ke baad se hi mahila chup kyon he?in sawaalon ko lekar jab police ne tafteesh kii, to pataa chalaa ki medical board ne ghanton rajani kaa chekup kiya or paaya ki rajani na to garbhvatee hui, na hi uskaa aborshan hua he
 Now if the doctors' medical report is correct, then the woman was not pregnant, while not only the woman's husband and mother-in-law are telling her pregnant, but the entire locality is saying that they have seen the woman's baby bump
 ab koun sachcha he, koun jhootha, yah to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal paaegaa
 In Mughalsarai, Uttar Pradesh, a young man entered the house of a policeman and killed his daughter in a fatal attack
 yuvak ne yuvati par chaaku se tabadatod waar kiye
 And leaving the girl half dead, he escaped from the house
 police aaropee kii talash kar rahi he jabakiyuvati kii haalat gambhirbani hui he
 The case is of Ravinagar area of mughalsarai
 jyoti naamak yuvati apane parivaar ke saath yahaan rahati he
 His father is in the police
 jinaki tainaati banaras main hai
 Late in the evening Jyoti was studying in her house
 tabhi uskaa parichit yuvak ranvijay vahaan aayaa or jyoti par chaaku se hamalaa bol diya
 He attacked Jyoti several times
 or maukey se bhaag niklaa
 Hearing Jyoti's scream, he reached the living room
 jahaan jyoti lahuluhaan hokar jameen par padi thi
 The housemates immediately informed the police about the incident
 or jyoti ko aspataal pahunchaaya
 Seeing Jyoti's critical condition, she was referred to another hospital
 police ne aaropee ranvijay ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar uski talash shuru kar di he
 There is a possibility of a love affair behind this incident
 lekin maamla ek pulicekarmi se juda hone kii vajah se mughalsarai police safataur par kuch bhi kehane se kataraa rahi he
 It was Mulayam Singh Yadav, the patriarch of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who thanked Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati for the first call after defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the parliamentary by-elections of Gorakhpur and Phulpur in March 2018
 did
 darasal, basapa ne un chunaavon main sapa ummidavaaron ko samarthan diya tha
 His son and SP president Akhilesh Yadav carried on the same spirit and went to meet Mayawati at Mall Avenue home
 yah uttar pradesh kii siyasat main us abhootpurv badlaav kii purv jhalak thi jo aakhirkaar janvari, 2019 main ho hi gai—kai dashakon kii adaavat ke baad sapa or basapa kaa gathbandhan
 Of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, SP 37, BSP 38 and coalition partner Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) are contesting on three seats
 25 varsh main pehali baar sapa or basapa 7 april se milakar reliyaan karengi
 Mayawati had the idea of campaigning for Mulayam in Mainpuri
 akhilesh or mayawati kam se kam 25 reliyaan karenge
 "to reverse the infamy of not winning a single seat in 2014, the BSP needs Muslim and Yadav votes, it already has a strong hold on Dalit votes," says Manoj Sivach, assistant professor of economics at the University of Meerut
 ''yahi vajah he ki party ne saharanpur, meerut, amroha or dhaurhara se muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara he
 Similarly, the SP is also trying to woo Muslims and that is why it has given tickets to Muslims in seats like Kairana, Sambhal and Rampur in western Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati ke virodh kii vajah se congress uttar pradesh main gathbandhan main to shaamil nahin ho saki, par congress uski rashtriya mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi ne apni party ke liye akhilesh se baatcheet kii thi
 Therefore, the Congress is moving ahead to save the SP and it is not appropriate to join hands with Akhilesh's uncle and sp's rebel Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia)
 par vah mayawati ko bakhshane ko taiyaar nahin he or usne saharanpur, bijanour, amroha or sitapur main basapa ke khilaaf muslim ummidavaaron ko utaara he
 It has also opened its doors to BSP leaders who are against the SP-BSP alliance

 basapa, sapa or bhaajapa ke dalbaluon ko tikat dene kii vajah se party main naaraazgi he
 Congress candidate from Gautam Budh Nagar, Arvind Singh Chauhan is the son of bjp's MLC Thakur Jayveer Singh

 Who can say that the incumbent candidate (chauhan) will not do this? ”BJP knows very well that it is not easy to repeat the success of 71 seats in 2014
 uski vot hissedari (43 fisadi) or sapa-basapa kii vot hissedari (42 fisadi) main bahut kam antar he
 At the same time, the combined vote share of both parties was more than BJP in 42 seats

 Therefore, he refused to give tickets to such sitting mps whose relationship is not working well in the party

 *** Differences are once again appearing in the Supreme Court
 ek taraf justise madan es lokur kii adhyakshata vaali bench he to duusari taraf justise arun mishra kii aguai vaali bench he
 The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra on Thursday referred the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for final disposal on Thursday, a day after its decision was criticized by the bench headed by Justice Lokur
 justise arun mishra kii adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey bench ne 8 farvari ko apane faisle main 2014 main supreme court ke die ek faisle ko ulat diya tha
 This decision was related to compensation of landowners (mostly farmers) on land acquisition
 buudhvaar kojustise lokurki adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey bench ne hi justise arun mishra kii aguai vaali bench kii ore se 8 farvari ko die faisle ko kanoon ke siddhanton ke khilaaf bataaya
 The bench termed the verdict as an order given in defiance of legal limits
 justise lokur kii adhyakshata vaali bench ke ek sadsy justise courian joseph bhi hai
 In the Supreme Court, it is unexpected that one Bench should declare the decision of the second Bench to be an Inquiry, while both the Benches have the same number of judges
 guuruuvaar ko jab jameen adhigrahan se judaa ek or cese justise arun mishra kii aguwai vaali bench ke saamne aayaa to unhone ise antim taur par nistaaran ke liye mukhya nyaayadhish ko refer kar diya
 This bench asked the Chief Justice to constitute a third bench so that the validity of the verdict can be decided
 justise arun mishra kii aguai vaali bench ne 8 farvari ko apane faisle main centre sarkaar ko thode samay kii raahat dete hue faisla diya tha ki centre ke paas adhigrihith jameen par us sthiti main bhi adhikaar he, agar jameen kaa muaavja sambandhit logon ko nahin diya gaya ho
 If there is money in the treasury of the government, then the compensation will be deemed to have been paid
 justise lokur kii aguwai vaali bench ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki kisi bhi hoicourt ko 8 farvari 2018 ke faisle par nirbhar nahin karnaa chahie
 The bench has also asked the judges of the Supreme Court not to deal with the matter
 justise madan lokur or justise courian joseph is saal 13 janvari ko hui us abhootpurv press conference main shaamil the jisame chaar sheersh jajon ne bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke kaamkaaj ke tauratreekon par sawaal uthaaya tha
 These four judges had also cited their letter sent to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the press conference
 us vakt arun mishra kii aguai vaali bench ko samvedansheel maamalon kii sunwaayee main ‘prefrd bench’(variyata vaali bench) bataaya gaya tha
 One can become obsessed with watching football in India
 vishwa cap mukaable main bhartiya team kahin nahin he, lekin bahut se bharatiyon kii jindagi maheene bhar ke is jashn main maano thahar-si jaati he
 In 2006, a player named Vikas Dhorasu took his place in the French team's list of players
 vikaas morishas ke rahane vaale the, jinke purakhe andhra pradesh se girmitiyaa majdoor banakar morishas pahunche the
 But this time, not one of the players of 32 teams competing for the World Cup in Brazil is of Indian origin
 haalanki aise kai udhaaharan hai, jinamein khilaadi un deshon ke liye khel rahe hai, jinase unka (yaa unke mata-pita kaa) janm kaa koi naata nahin he
 For example, Belgium has a Congo-originated team, Switzerland has a team of Albania, England has a Jamaican, Germany has a Turkish team, Netherlands has a Suriname player, France has a Senegal team
 The players are playing guanyi-bissuana in the Portugal team and players of Iceland origin in the US team
 lekin itane saare deshon ke bich kisi bhi desh kii team main bhartiya mul kaa koi khilaadi najar nahin aata
 However, which corner of the world is such that people of Indian origin have not settled
 lekin in sabake baavjood bharat main footbal kii deewangi sir chadhakar bol rahi he
 People are watching the match so lately by spoiling their sleep and rubbing their eyes early in the morning, as if there is a craze on them
 hamaara yah bhaavnaatmak or aadhyatmik judaav hi bharatiyon ko kuch vishesh bana detaa he
 At least football is a sport in which no one can call us narrow nationalists
 main dilli main apane ek saathi se bijness kol ke liye samay tay kar rahaa tha to usne chhutate hi kaha, ‘‘nahin, nahin, us samay main colombia kaa match dekh rahaa hounga
 "that is, in a country where my partner will never have any legs and where to understand the dialect language is very far away
" jahaan kaa sangeet (main puure yakeen ke saath yah kah saktaa hum) usne kabhi nahin suna hoga
 But despite this, it is not acceptable for him to lose sight of that country's game for a while
 uske liye colombia kaa sirf itnaa hi mahatv he ki vah vishwa cap main khel rahaa he
 So, there is such pure passion in the hearts of Indian football lovers, which is not blurred by the stream of patriotism
 yahi khaasiyat bharat ke footbal premiyon ko uske cricket premiyon se ekadam alag karti he
 For cricket lovers, it is only the Indian cricket team (or, say, the victorious team India) that counts and embraces death better than watching a New Zealand vs Sri Lanka or England vs South Africa match
 har chaar saal main ek baar jab footbal vishwa cap kaa bukhaar chadhataa he, bhartiya diwaanon ke saamne ek sawaal munh baae khadaa ho jaataa he
 Whereas people from countries like Brazil or England, Argentina or Netherlands never face this question even in their dreams
 sawaal yah he ki kise samarthan diya jaae?bharatiyon kii kismat main apni team ko maidan main tunnel se nikalate dekhakar sharir main bijli-si surasuri daudaahe, rongte khadey ho jane, maidan main bhari duniya ke saamne rashtriya dhun bajte sunakar seenaa chaudaa ho jane jaisaa koi ehsaas nahin he
 Nor is it a pleasure for Indians to come to a crazy country and proudly take the name of Indian players in their accent
 na hi bharatiyon kii ankhon ko us najaare kaa sukh-chaun naseeb he, jab vishwa cap mukaable main maidan main camera khushi se jhum rahe bhartiya darshakon par focus kar de, sundar bhartiya ladkiyaan haath laharaate hue dikhen, range-pute chehre vaale bhartiya diwane dhol bajaate dikhen
 This country with a population of more than one billion is completely missing from this great celebration
 hamaare paas iskaa hissaa banane kaa ek mauka 1950 main aayaa tha, jab pichhali dfa brazil main yojit hue world cap main bhartiya team ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 But the influential people in the Indian Football Federation decided not to send the team due to their defeated mood
 vah team shaayad vahaan apni koi jagah bana sakati thi
 But the Federation felt that the expenditure is high and that much expenditure cannot be tolerated
 aaj bhi bharat or bhartiya footbal us adoordarshita or parajeet manodasha kaa khamiyaja bhugat rahaa he
 It was a period when India was a victim of a backward mood in the world, seeing more within itself
 desh par raaj karne vaala abhijatya varg pratispardhaa ke naam se naak-bhunh sikodta tha
 This hatred of the idea of competition has made our business, industry, business and football all vain
 or ab jab ham duniya se hode lene ke liye taiyaar hai to ham aage badaae ke kaabil hi nahin hai
 Except for a small circle, like cricket
 yani ek aisa khel, jise mutthi bhar desh hi khelte hai
 Our condition is also very bad in other matters in the world
 hamaare vishvavidhyalay vaishvik str ke nahin hai, hamaara vaigyanik anusandhan behad ausat darje kaa he, hamaari raksha takanic kaa bhi yahi haal he, hamaare udyog hode lene ke kaabil nahin, hamaari fouj piddi se pakistan se hi ladgaye ke laayak he (or china ko yah maaloom he)
 Our diplomats barely speak English (far from Russian and Arabic) and our football team is ranked 154th in the world, one point above Singapore and one point below Malaysia
 lekin hamaare footbal ke diwane kareeb-kareeb yaa puure ek number par honge kyonki unka footbal prem is jahaan se upar kaa lagata he
 They choose their favorite team, completely free from the emotions of any flag or country
 bahut sambhav he ki ek bhartiya parivaar main pita brazil ke paksh main hon or betaa spain kaa divaana ho, beti italy kii team ko pasand karti ho or maa ko argentina raas aata ho
 There has been a kind of craze in Brazil for a long time in India
 yah deewangi sirf isliye nahin ki uske khilaadi anokhaa khel khelte hai, balki yah ek kism kii bhaavana he ki brazil kuch-kuch bharat jaisaa hi he
 a vast, chaotic, Third World country, where there is terrible non-parity and cities are littered with slums
 isse shaayad yah ehsaas bhi hota he ki brazil ke log kuch-kuch ham jaise hi dikhte hai
 But when we look at the football lovers of that country and the women there, it seems that unlike India, countries like Brazil are few in the world
 sex ko lekar unki udaar bhavanaaen, deele-dhaale naitik aachaar-vyavhaar se hamaara sabaka padataa he to ham jaanate hai ki hamaare bich samanta kii bhi ek seemaa he
 Indian junkies may not seek a picture of themselves or their country in World Cup teams, but rather find a phrase of eccentricity and sportsmanship that is not bound by the boundaries of a nation
 brazil kuch aise andaaj main footbal kheltaa he ki sari duniya kii nigahen uski ore khinchi chali jaati hai
 Recently, the Spanish team has started playing the same way and Argentina plays the same way
 iske vipareet england or germany (yaa yun kahie ki 10 saal pehle kaa germany) donon timen apni apil apane deshavaasiyon ke bich talashti hai
 But it is also not right to say that the people of India are jealous of those countries which are not in the above line, but only through their efforts they reach the World Cup
 masalan, costa rika, algeria, greece, bosnia or harjegobina, dakshin korea, america, hondarus, iran vagairah
 The truth is that Indian enthusiasts are disappointed by India's absence in the World Cup after every four years
 bhale ve apni pasandida tiimon ko dekhakar khush hote hon
 Just as the names of players from other countries are known and known in every household of India, similarly they wish that one day the names of Indian players are also known in other countries and embassies spread all over the world
 More than they become our ambassadors
 vishwa cap muqablon main footbal dekhnaa shramsadhy he, lekin khel main hamen anokhe saundarya or bhaawanaaon ke darshan hote hai
 But it hurts even to see where we stand

 India has strongly objected to this
 bharat kii ore se kaha gaya he ki pakistan main bhartiya ucchayukta ke saath kharaab vyavhaar kiya gaya he
 We hope that our diplomats in Pakistan will be allowed to discharge their functions without any hindrance

 rio olympic ke mahila singles badminton mukaable ke semifinal main pivi sindhu kaa muqabla japan kii world number chah khilaadi nojomi okuharaa se hoga
 Sindhu is just one step away from winning the medal
 quarter final mukaable main sindhu ne china kii number do badminton khilaadi wang yihaan ko shikast di thi
 a tough match against Japanese player will be followed by defeating world number two player Sindhu who is on the seventh heaven
 wo puri tarah se form main dikhaai de rahi hai or court par shandaar strokes laga rahi hai
 In the quarterfinal match, Sindhu played a good game against Wang
 lekin ab unka muqabla duniya kii number do japan kii star badminton khilaadi nojomi okuharaa se hona he
 Which would not be easy in any sense
 donon khilaadiyon ke bich abtak teen mukaable hue hai
 In which Sindhu has won only one
 aise main unhen semifinal main behad damdaar khel dikhaanaa hoga
 Nozomi's pan is heavy, if you look at the record, then in this important match of Nozomi, the pan is considered heavy

 After this, in the year 2015, he defeated Sindhu by 19-21, 21-13, 21-8 at Malaysia Masters

 Sindhu has been able to beat Nozomi only once in the Asia Youth Under 19 Championship 18-21, 21-17, 22-20
 donon ke bich yun to hameshaa kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mili he
 But this time Sindhu gets a golden opportunity to avenge her previous defeat in the biggest stage Olympics of the Games
 sindhu par rahegi najrenrio olympic main bharat ko abtak ek bhi medal hasil nahin hua he
 In such a situation, they will be under pressure to win this match
 sindhu ne quarter final main jis tarah kaa khel dikhaaya he, usase ye saaf ho gaya he ki unhen roak paanaa kisi ke liye bhi aasaan nahin hone vaala hai
 In the first match of the Rio Olympics, Sindhu defeated Michelle Lee of Canada in straight games 19-21, 21-15, 21-17, then in the pre-quarter match, Chinese Taipei's Tai Ju-ying was 21-13, 21-14 Beat
 iske baad wang yihaan ko 22-20, 21-19 se maat di

 This challenge is on the strength of our soldiers, who will fight defeat or victory in any case, they are not going to run back
 'lalu yadav ne likhaa, 'jaise gandhi ji ne lalkaar kar angrejon ko bharat chodo kehane ke baad karo yaa maro kaa naaraa diya tha vaise hi yah ladaai bhi desh todane waalon ke khilaaf he

 If you did not create chaos on the road with complete mobilization, then your rights would have been abolished by the Modi government

 Which side will the camel sit in the next Lok Sabha elections, is it clear now? Will the bjp-led NDA repeat its 2014 victory in 2019, while retaining its current invincible image? After the bjp's landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah had tweeted: "so we should forget 2019 and start preparing for it by 2024 with some hope
" '' aam maanas bhi umr abdulla vaala raag hi alaap rahaa he
 Will the Congress-led UPM alliance, if it really takes shape, challenge the electoral dominance of the bjp-led NDA in 2019? The answer to this question has been swinging between the opposition's high aspirations and deep disappointment since 2015
 dilli or phir bihar main bhaajapa kii haar ke baad is vichaar ne aakaar lenaa shuru kiya tha
 Since 1977, the country has a long history of grand alliance at the national level, but the idea of a state-level grand alliance was completely new to contesting a major national party
 anya pichhadaa varg kii raajnneeti karne vaale bihar ke dhur virodhiyon, janata dal (unitate) ke nitish kumaar or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke mukhiya lalu prasad gale mili
 The Congress also came together to deepen this effect of friendship
 yaheen se vipaksh ke liye aashaa kii ek kiran phooti
 The idea was further strengthened by Mamata Banerjee's landslide victory in the May 2016 elections in Bengal
 ek intervyuu main lalu prasad ne aashaa se damakate chehre ke saath garvile andaaj main kaha tha, ''pashchim bengal, bihar, uttar pradesh or punjab main upie ekajute ho gaya to ham bhaajapa nit endie ko 2019 main bahumat kaa aankada chune nahin denge
 "the basis for this is that 175 out of total 543 Lok Sabha seats come from these four states
 2014 main endie ne yahaan se 112 siten jeetin jo loksabhaa main endie kii kul takat kaa ek tihaai he
 However, this formula can be effective only when the Grand Alliance is formed at two levels — first, all the parties of these four important states are united which are outside the NDA; Second, another coalition was formed for the rest of the territories
 rajyastar par mahagathbandhan bikharaa to rashtriya str par ise dharaashai hone se koi roak nahin saktaa
 However, the BJP registered a landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in March 2017 and the enthusiasm of the opposition parties turned into despair
 uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan kargar nahin rahaa
 In the triangular contest, the opposition parties suffered a severe defeat
 akhilesh yadav ke netritv vaala congress-sapa gathbandhan buree tarah haara
 Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party seems to have been wiped out from the political scenario of Uttar Pradesh
 nitish kaa baad main endie kaa haath thaamna, pehle se hi charmaraaye mahagathbandhan par antim prahaar sabit hua
 Gujarat again woke up The Ascongress may have lost to the BJP in Gujarat but the results brought some positive signals for the party and the hopes started reverberating in the opposition camp
 janeudhari brahman hone ke pramaan ke saath rahul gandhi tilak lagaakar pehle se zyada aatmavishvaas se labarej teen nausikhue saajheedaaron—hardik patel, jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakor—ke saath chunavi samar main utre
 In this 'mini-mahagathbandhan', both the mandal, the kamandal, and the agenda were found simultaneously
 loksabhaa chunaav aaj karaae jaaen to nattejey kya honge? ise samajhane ke liye hue india today-karvi incites ke saajha upkram 'desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan' main do paridrishy ubharkar saamne aae (is survey main har chah maheene par puure desh ke siyaasi mizaaj ko tatolane kii koshish hoti he)
 First scenario, if the UPA fought without its three main allies SP, BSP and Trinamool, it is likely to get only 102 seats
 doosraa paridrishy, upie kaa in teenon sahyogiyon ke saath chunaav-purv gathbandhan ho jaae to use 202 siten tak mil sakati hai
 The NDA is likely to get 309 seats in the first scenario while 258 seats in the second scenario, which is just short of the majority figure of 272
 aaj jabaki punjab main congress kii sarkaar he or bihar main nitish ke paala badalane se sameekaran badal chuke hai, uttar pradesh or pashchim bengal hi do pramukh rajya ho sakate hai jahaan gathbandhan ho jane kii surat main upie ke liye sambhaavnaaon ke dwaar khulte hai
 How close to this possibility does reality look? Will Mamata and Mayawati leave their ego and agree to work with Rahul Gandhi, whom she considers a newbie to politics? In November 2017, the SP, BSP and Congress appeared to agree to share 30, 30 and 20 seats respectively for the next Lok Sabha elections
 sapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''akhilesh mulaayam nahin hai, ve mayawati ko 'buaaji' kahkar sambodhit karte hai
 Of course their mutual coordination has not been very good but both of them respect each other
 sapa-basapa, donon anubhav kar rahi hai ki uttar pradesh ke maujuuda rajnatik halaat main donon ne samjhauta na kiya to donon kaa safaya ho jayega
 "congress leader from Mathura Pradeep Mathur says," Akhilesh and Rahul have already had friendly relations and it has matured further during the UP elections
 ''sonia gandhi kii kareebi hone ke naate mamata is gathbandhan kii dhuree hai
 He has worked with Rahul during protests in Parliament and believes that Arvind Kejriwal should also be included in this alliance
 survey main mamata ko lagaataar duusari baar sarvshereshth mukhyamantri ke rup main chunaa gaya
 Another thing needs to be understood very carefully
 surveykshan ke duusare paridrishy main upie kii aguwai vaale mahagathbandhan ke liye jo bhavishyavaanee he, use 2019 main upie kii jeet kii bhavishyavaanee samajhane kii bhul nahin kerani chahie
 The upa's grand alliance with three partners will not be enough to reach victory figures
 survey is sthiti main endie ko hi bada khilaadi maanata he
 Despite being in power for nearly four years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is still ahead in popularity by 53 points, ahead of Rahul Gandhi (22)
 phir bhi surveykshan se yah to pataa chalata hi he ki upie saajhedaaron ko ekajute karne main kaamyaab rahaa to endie apane dam par sarkaar banane ke liye 272 saansadon ke jaadui aankade se peeche rah jayega
 With the support of Naveen Patnaik and bringing the satraps like DMK in South India, the number of UPA seats will increase
 netritv kaa ragadamahagathbandhan kaa netritv koun karegaa, yah asahmati kaa mukhya mudda banegaa
 Veterans like Mamata and Mayawati will not be readily accepted as Akhilesh or Rahul leaders
 survey main is mudde par bhi ek prashn tha—aapaki najar main gaiyr-bhaajapa mahagathbandhan ko sabase acha netritv koun de saktaa he? 23 pratishat vot ke saath rahul pehali pasand hai, duusare number par raheen mamata (10)
 Which leader do you see as the best alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi? In response to this question, people considered Rahul Gandhi as the best
 sankhya ke hisaab se netritv kaa nirnay karen to vah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki koun-si party sabase zyada siten lekar aati he
 But even after the leadership has decided, each of these areas is equipped with satrap veto power
 inamen se koi bhi kisi bhi maukey par gachha de saktaa he
 At present, the chances of a Grand Alliance for the UPA seem slim, the political scenario that will be formed in the coming days may be more challenging
 2018 main rajyon main hone vaale chunaav, congress ke saamne chunautiyon kaa ambara khadaa karne vaale hai
 The party will have to return to state power again, defeating the anti-incumbency factor in Karnataka
 iske alaava use bhaajapa shasit teen rajyon—madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh, jahaan disambar main chunaav hone hai—main se kam se kam do ko to bhaajapa se chhinana hi hoga
 If the Congress loses all four states then the power struggle for 2019 will end in 2018 itself
 gathbandhan ke saamne sabase badi chunauti is baat kii he ki kya vah daliton, alpsankhyakon, vidrohi prabhaavshaalee jatiyon ke votaron ko ek saath pirokar rakhte hue hindu mukhyadhara ke voton main send laga paaegaa, jise aakarshith karne kaa prayaas rahul kar rahe hai? iskaa uttar is par nirbhar karata he ki gathbandhan kaise or kis had tak bina bahusankhyak hindu voton ko naaraaz kiye, endie ke hindutv agenda ko joardaar chunauti de paata he
 At the same time, the coalition will also have to put an agenda in front of the country that can woo voters and attract them to the alliance
 sankhyabal badhaane ke avasarwaadi khel or har baat par endie kaa bas rasmi virodh kar dene se aage kii sochate hue upie ke mahagathbandhan ko ek kaaran kii bhi jarurat hogi
 The agenda of communalism versus non-communalism is now a beaten formula that eventually mobilizes voters in favor of BJP
 mahagathbandhan ko spasht taur par desh ke liye ek vaikalpik aarthik najariya saamne rakhana hoga, saath hi use ek jitau chunavi ranneeti or patakatha kii bhi jarurat hogi
 If the Rahul-led Congress manages to reform the organization, find effective ways to revive the federal front, form alliances like the Grand Alliance, then ousting the NDA from power will not be imaginable

 i know you are from BJP / NDA and it will be difficult for you to speak against it
 lekin kendra sarkaar in sanshodhano ko sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main paas karwaanaa chaahati he, jo behad khatarnaak hai
 'kejriwal has further written,' If the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act 2003 are passed, then all the powers of the power sector will be vested in the Central Government

 Rocky Yadav, son of JDU MLC Manorama Devi, accused in the Gaya Road Rage case, was sent to 14 days judicial custody on Tuesday
 bihar ke up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki road rej jaisi ghatana vikrut maansikta kii dein he
 It is difficult to prevent negative incidents in a road rage like charge
 haa, is par turant karrwai or giraftaar karke sarkaar aparaadhiyon kaa manobal tod sakati he or janata main kanoon vyavastha ke prati vishwaas jagaa sakati he
 Tejaswane went on to express grief over the murder of a young man named Aditya Kumar Sachdeva, expressing anger over the BJP and the media targeting a special party using words like Jungle Raj
 tejasvi ne ‘apane dil kii baat kaarykram’ ke tahat fasebuk post likhi
 Tejaswi wrote, 'road Razki is a tragic incident of Aditya being shot dead in an unfortunate incident
 is ghatana se unhen bahut aghat pahunchaa he
 It is unfortunate for any young person to go for such a purposefully negative reason
 is ghatana kii jitani bhi ninda kii jaae kam he
 My condolences are with the deceased family
 ’up mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘is maamle menaaropee yuvakko aise jaghanya aparaadh ke liye katai bakhsha nahin janaa chahie
 i strongly condemn this incident
 lekin bhaajapa netaaon or uski samarthit media is ghatana ko kuch is prakaar pesh kar rahi he, jaise yah puure desh main apane aap main ek durlabh or road rej kii pehali aapraadhik ghatana he
 Tejashwi said that if a relative of an accused is a member of any ruling political party, it should not be construed that the accused is under government protection
 poocha- bijepi ko vyapam main jangalraj kyon nahin yaad aayaa?tejasvi ne endie main sabase adhik aapraadhik chhavi waalon ko tikat dene or raajnneetik sangrakshan die jane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, ‘madhya pradesh main ek ipies adhikari kii baaluu mafia dwaara saream nirdayata se hatya kar di jaati he tathaa vyapam ghotaale main ek-ek kar gavaahon ko raste se hataa diya jaataa he to vahaan jangal raaj kaa aagaaj nahin hota he
 Citing the example of neighboring bjp-ruled Jharkhand state, he said that when a JMM leader and an engineer are killed there, neither the sleeping conscience of BJP leaders nor the bjp-backed media remembered Junglej's jumla
 bijepi ko murathal cond kii yaad dilaitejasvi ne kaha ki haryana main samuhik balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen desh kii rajdhani dilli main balaatkaar or roderej ke maamle rajg ke netaaon ko saamaanya or swabhaavik najar aati he kyonki vahaan kii police centre sarkaar ke adheen kaam karti he
 He said that the quick action and arrest of the police in the Aditya case has given way to the intention of the NDA leaders who had suffered a crushing defeat in the last Bihar assembly to bake their political bread
 haryana main badhate balaatkaar ke maamalon ke virodh main aaj kai saamaajik sanghathanon ne dilli main haryana bhawan ke saamne pradarshan kiya
 The protest was led by social activist Aruna Roy
 gauratlab he ki rajya main pichley 34 din main rape kii 19 ghataanaon ke baad hooda sarkaar nishane par he
 The protest is also about the fact that some ministers of the state have given many insensitive statements in the rape case
 vah bhi tab jab pichley somvaar ko hi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne jind main balaatkaar peedit ek ladki ke parivaar se mulaakaat kii thi or bharosa dilaayaa tha rajya main ladakiyon ko puri suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 Significantly, the Hooda government is on target after 19 reductions of rape in the state in the last 34 days
 virodh is baat ko lekar bhi he ki rajya ke kuch mantriyon ne balaatkaar ke maamle main kai baar asamvedansheel bayaan bhi die hai
 That too when Congress President Sonia Gandhi met the family of a girl victim of rape in Jind last Monday and assured that the girls would be provided complete security in the state

 The minister's activism on Twitter is fantastic
 yah daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa he ki maanav sansaadhan mantri pradhanmantri ke har twit ko ri-twit kar dete hai
 For this, big-data analysis of activism of other ministers on Twitter will have to be done
 kisi export ko pataa karnaa chahie ki pradhanmantri or pradhanmantri karyaalay ke handle se kiye gaye twit ko unke mantri, party ke kaaryakarta ke alaava anya log kitna ri-twit yaa likes karte hai
 However, we would like to remind the HR Minister that the re-tweets are not the resource ministers
 kaash ve ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvavidhyalay main 9000 tadarth shikshakon ko permanent karne kaa vaada puraa kar pate or us bare main bhi rose twit karte
 You can also tweet the status of a court case or whatever the reasons are
 baaki desh main khaali padon or khaali class room ke bare main bhi to twit kar sakate hai
 Is it the minister's job to only meet, announce, tweet or re-tweet the inauguration? mere adhyayan kaal ke dauraan mantralay se sambandhit itani kam suchanaaen hai ki lagata nahin ki unke paas apana kaam bataane ke liye bahut kuch he
 They are engaged in retweeting the tweets of the party and the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan The activities of Minister's tweeter between September 1 and September 16 do not seem to have much effect
 soochna kii itani adhik bahulata he ki kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri kaa handle chamakate hi bina padhe koi ri-twit kiye ja rahaa he
 People have tweeted about many problems on the minister's handle
 ummid he un par karrwai hoti hogi
 The things that are reaching me are not according to that
 phir bhi mantri ko yah bataane ke liye likh rahaa hum ki aapke handle par aapke mantralay kii shikaayatein dekhakar kisi adhikari ko dar nahin lagata he
 It would have worked
 vaise mere is lekh ke bare main maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke adhikari or karmchaaree kya kehete hai, jaananaa chaahunga
 Their mutual gossip will be fun

 baharhaal, ham maanav sansaadhan mantri ko yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki ri-twit sansaadhan mantri nahin hai
 i wish he could fulfill the promise of permitting 9000 ad hoc teachers in Delhi University within a year and would tweet about it daily
 court cese ho yaa jo bhi kaaran hon, uskaa states bhi to twit kar sakate hai
 In the rest of the country, you can also tweet about empty posts and empty class rooms
 kya sirf milan-mulaakaat, ghoshnaa, udghaatan hi twit yaa ri-twit karnaa mantri kaa kaam he
 During my studies there are so few information related to the ministry that it does not seem that they have much to say about their work
 ve party or pradhanmantri ke twit ko hi ri-twit karne main lage hai
 The comments 1 sitambar se 16 sitambar ke bich mantri ji ke twitor kii gatividhiyon kaa koi khaas asar nahin dikhataa he
 There is such a plurality of information that at times it seems that without re-tweeting the Prime Minister's handle is flashing
 mantri ke handle par logon ne kai samasyaon ko lekar twit kiya he
 Hopefully action will be taken on them
 mujh tak jitani baaten pahunch rahi hai, us hisaab se nahin hoti he
 However, i am writing to the Minister to tell you that no officer is afraid of seeing the complaints of your Ministry on your handle
 lagata to kaam ho jaataa
 By the way, i would like to know about this article what the officials and employees of the Ministry of Human Resources say

 Retail traders protested against the walmart-flipkart deal on Monday at around 1000 locations across the country
 khudara kaarobaariyon ke sanghathan kanfederation of ol india treders (cat) ne sarkaar se maang kii ki is saude se i-commers kshetra main galat chalan main kai guna vruddhi hogi
 He said that the walmart-flipkart deal would prove to be a step forward towards grabbing the retail business
 cat kii maang he ki flipcart-walmart deal ko radd kiya jaae
 Kat's national president b
 si
 Bhartia and General Secretary Praveen Khandelwal said that many e-commerce companies have caused huge damage to the e-commerce platform over the years through price loot, heavy discounts and other wrong methods
 unhone daawa kiya ki aise samay main jabai-commerske bare main koi spasht niti nahin he,walmartke liye pratyaksh videshi nivesh niti ke press note teen kaa ulanghan karnaa behad aasaan ho jayega
 The court will oppose the deal
 Earlier, Kat said in her statement that this encouraged Walmart to enter Flipkart indirectly by buying Flipkart
 khandelwal ne kaha ki vyapaariyon kaa sanghathan cat pehle hi is sandarbh main bhartiya pratispardhaa ayog ko apni aapattiyon se avgat kara chukaa he or jarurat padane par vah adaalat main bhi is saude kaa virodh karegaa
 Complaints traders in the CCI said that this deal is not entirely in the interest of the businessmen
 agar sarkaar ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya to wo iske khilaaf court bhi ja sakate hai
 CAT has filed a complaint against it in the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
 unki shikaayat he ki i-commers market pehle hi niyamon kaa ulanghan kai baar kar chuke hai
 These e-commerce companies offer heavy discounts online which is wrong
 isse online or ofline keemton main kaaphi fark aata he or iskaa nuksaan retailor ko hota he
 This is the reason why today traders all over the country do not want this deal of Walmart and Flipkart to continue because it will cause a lot of loss to the business class
 unka yah bhi kahana tha ki jab tak is deal ko radd nahin kiya jaataa tab tak unka ye virodh jari rahegaa
 It is noteworthy that Walmart Inc, a us-based retail giant, has already announced the purchase of a 77 percent stake in Flipkart for about Rs 1 lakh and Rs six billion ($ 16 billion)
 isse pehle ek june ko cat ne vastu or seva kar (jiesti) ke lagu hone ke ek saal puure hone ke uplakshya main deshbhar main jiesti diwas yojit kiya
 Cat said there were mixed reactions from traders about GST
