 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne narendra modi ke gujarat model par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki aise model se desh ko bhagwaan hi bachaae
 Sonia Gandhi prayed to God to save India from the Gujarat development model

 ' saurav ganguli ne kaha he ki jab tatkaaleen coach greg chapel ne unhen bhartiya team se baahar kar diya tha or vah vaapasi ke liye betaab the
 At that time, his father was not tolerating this struggle and wanted this star cricketer to retire from the game
 bhartiya team ke purv captain ne yah khulaasa unki jald hi prakashit hone vaali aatmakatha ‘e centuri ij note inf’ main kiya he
 When Chappell was the coach of the Indian team, Ganguly was removed from the captaincy and was even dropped from the team
 ganguli iske saath hi kaha ki jab unhen 2008 main irani trophy ke liye shesh bharat kii team main nahin chunaa gaya to vah ‘gussa’ or ‘maayoos’ the
 a few months later, he announced his retirement
 unhen yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki aakhir unhen team se kyon baahar kiya gaya
 He later called team captain Anil Kumble and tried to find out the reason
 ganguli ne kitaab main likhaa he, ‘maine unase sapaat shabdon main poocha kya vah samajhate hai ki antim ekadash ke liye main swat: pasand nahin rah gaya hum
 As usual Bhadrajan Kumble seemed to be upset with my phone
 unhone mujhase kaha ki is faisle se pehle dilip vengsarakar kii adhyakshata vaali chayansmiti ne unase mashvira nahin kiya
 The book is co-authored by Gautam Bhattacharya
 ganguli ne kumble se aglaa sawaal kiya ki kya vah maanate hai ki unki team ko unki sevaayen chahie? ‘kumble ke jawaab se main santusht hua
 He said that if he had to decide, he would choose him again for the upcoming Test match
 isse mujhe kaaphi raahat mili
 Ganguly played in domestic cricket to give a strong message to the selectors
 yahaan tak ki unhone chandigarh main jepi atre memorial trophy main bhi hissaa liya
 The team was soon announced for the first two Tests against Australia and Ganguly was involved
 iske saath hi board adhyaksh team bhi ghoshit kii gai
 It was a second-class team that would take on Australia in Chennai
 ganguli likhaa he, ‘board adhyaksh ekadash main yuva khilaadiyon yaa unhen rakhaa jaataa tha jinka test kariyar anishchit ho
 i was also included in it
 yah team krishnamachari shrikant kii aguwai vaali nai chayan samiti ne chuni thi, lekin lagata tha ki uski soch bhi pehali vaali samiti kii tarah hi thi
 The message was clear that Sourav Ganguly, who had played more than 100 Test matches, had a re-trial
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main bahut gusse main tha
 Then i told my father that i should retire now
 ab bahut ho chukaa
 My father was a little surprised
 isse pehle jab greg chapel ne mujhe team se baahar rakhaa or main vaapasi ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa tha, tab vah chaahate ki main sanyas le luun
 Because he was not seeing his son's struggle with him
 ’ganguli ne kaha, ‘tab maine unka virodh kiya tha
 i said Bapi (dad) you wait
 main vaapasi karuunga
 i still have cricket left
 isliye teen saal baad jab unhone usee vyakti se sanyas kii baat suni to vah hairaan the
 Ganguly said that he spoke to Kumble and asked him not to make a hasty decision
 unhone kaha, ‘maine use aashwast kiya, lekin andar se mujhe lag gaya tha ki ab samay aa gaya he
 i had made up my mind that i would leave no stone unturned in this series
 cricket itihaas gavaah he ki meri antim siries shandaar rahi

 amarinder sinhakopunjabaki satta sanbhale kareeb dedh saal ho chukaa he, lekin punjab ko drugs ke abhishaap se mukti nahin mil pai he
 India Today investigation has revealed that the problem of drug addiction in Punjab continues to worsen
 2016 main relies hui bollywood film 'udata punjab' ne us samay kii punjab sarkaar kii neend uda di thi
 Ultimately, Congress Captain Amarinder Singh succeeded in regaining power by reversing the rule of clouds last year
 punjab main drugs (chittey) ke nasoor ko lekar logon ke gusse kaa bhi captain kii jeet main ek yogadan rahaa
 Undercover reporters found during the investigation that chitta (synthetic heroin) in Punjab is being sold indiscriminately not only in the deserted lanes of remote villages, but also in rehabilitation centers, which have been created with a view to rid youth of drug addiction
 punjab main kuch dawa kii dukaanon par opioids (opioids), steemulents (stimulants) or syringe bina doctor ke parche ke bikate dekhe gaye
 However, retail stores are strictly prohibited from doing so
 india today kii padtalaindia today kii special investigation team ne pehle ferozepur main opioid ke jariye treetment karne vaale outpesheynt centre kaa rukh kiya
 These are called OOAT centers
 bataa den ki ferozepur samet punjab ke kai jilon main syringe kii bikri ko lekar tamaam bandishen hai
 These restrictions were implemented in may-june after information about the deaths of at least 30 people in the state due to drug overdose
 india today kii jaanch se saamne aayaa ki kis tarah ab bhi nashe ke saudagar or nashe kii lat ke shikaar log tamaam bandishon ko dhata bataa kar injectors ke saath medical steemulents kharid rahe hai
 a drug dealer at Ferozepur's OOAT Center explained how syringes can be procured as part of a steroid pack from a drug store located a few yards away
 reporter ne poocha- steroid kaa naam kya he?jawaab mila- deka-deurobolinareporter- kitne kaa miltaa he?jawaab- 170 rupeiske baad nashili dawaaen bechney vaale shaks ne andercover team ko us dawa kii dukaan se steroid nidel kit hasil karne ke liye bheja
 Chitta or heroin is usually taken intravenously
 under cover reporter jab dawa kii dukaan par pahunche to ek pack ke liye 180 rupye kii maang kii gai
 Neither a doctor's form was sought, nor was there any record of the needle kit being sold at that drugstore
 reporter ne dawa dukandaar se poocha- agar ham badi maatra main nidel kits khareednaa chahen to kya mil jaaenge?dukandaar ne kaha- haa, mangalvaar ko mil jaaenge, jitne chaaho le janaa
 According to a 2016 government survey, at least 76% of the opioid addiction victims in Punjab are between 18 and 35 years of age
 punjab opiad dependence survey, 2016 main saamne aayaa tha ki punjab main nashe kii lat ke shikaar logon main heroin lene vaale sabase zyada hai
 Number of victims of opioid addiction in Punjab in the survey 2
 3 lakh bataai gai
 However, independent experts say that this number is much more than this
 
 Pharmaceutical opioids like tramadol are also being misused in Punjab
 ise anti narkotics kanoon ke tahat psycotropic padaarth ghoshit kiya gaya he
 An investigation by the India Today Special Investigation Team revealed that the drug is being sold openly in Chandigarh
 shahar ke vyast bazaar main ek pharma store is drug ko bina medical parche ke bechate dekha gaya
 Undercover reporter asked- Is tremadol available? How much is a leaf? Answer received - 150 rupees
 reporter ne jab kaha ki kya koi or sasta brand milegaa to pharma store vaale ne tamak kar kaha, kya ye kaaphi nahin he ki ham ise tumhen de rahe hai
 Surprising answers were received when under-cover reporters sought to know more about the availability of chitta or heroin in other places in the state
 ferozepur ke civil aspataal ke thik baahar hi nashe kaa ek saudagar chitta bechate dikhaa
 He said, my motorcycle is in the parking lot
 mujhe paise do, main abhi ise laakar detaa hum
 He demanded Rs 1,000 for two pouches of heroin
 vaada puraa nahin kar paae captain?bataa den ki amarinder singh sarkaar ne drugs kii supplai par ankush lagane ke liye kai kadam uthaane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Such as formation of special task force, dope test of government employees, recommendation of death penalty for drug traffickers etc
 baavjood iske opioid or synthetic drugs kaa avaidh kaarobaar rajya main khub punap rahaa he
 India Today's undercover reporter reached a private drug addiction center in Ferozepur
 is ‘hansraj nasha chhudaao centre’ par aane vaale marijon ko andhadhundh narcotic dardanaashak kii strips banti ja rahi thi
 In the absence of a qualified medical practitioner, taking this narcotic drug is not free from danger for anyone
 andercover reporters kii jaanch se saamne aayaa ki duty par doctor aaraam se baitha tha
 Victims of drug addicts visiting the center were neither being checked up nor were they being given any form
 haalanki, saamaanya protocol ke mutabik drugs kii lat kaa str kya he uske hisaab se ilaaj kiya janaa chahie
 Sangrur-based rehabilitation specialist Mohan Sharma warns that the indiscriminate supply is very full of dangers without the caution of drug deportation
 sharma ke mutabik is tarah kii dawaaon se nashe kii lat ke shikaar logon ko kshanik ullas sa anubhav hota he, jise prabhavi ilaaj samajhane kii bhul kii jaati he
 Victims of addiction dissolve these pills in water and inject them into their blood
 bataa den ki captain amarinder singh ne 2017 main punjab vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kaha tha ki ve kasam khate hai ki agar satta main aae to hafton main hi drugs kii samasya ko khatm kar denge
 But when India Today reporters arrived at the civil hospital in Ferozepur in July this year, they saw to what extent the drugs were still kept prey to the youth of Punjab
 chikitsa centre ke viraane parisar main kai yuva drugs ke injection lete dikhaai die
 a young man jumped into the sea from Mumbai's bandra-worli sea link
 yah puraa vakya ceilink main lage sisitivi camaron main qaid ho gaya
 Within five seconds, the security guard rushed there, but nothing of the young man was found
 sisitivi tasviir main saaf dikh rahaa he ki achaanak varli si link par ek taxi aakar rukati he or taxi se 30 saal kaa akshay neeche utarataa he
 Asking the taximen to stop, he returns, picks up his hat from the road and starts sitting in his taxi
 lekin shaayad uski tabiyat kharaab hoti he or vah taxi se utarkar ulti karne lagata he
 Holding the pillar for a while, he stands there and then suddenly rails in a few seconds and jumps into the sea
 ghatana ke bare main mumbai police ke disipi es jayakumar ne bataaya ki us yuvak ne bhaikhla se taxi lee thi
 He told the taxi person to go to Borivali via Sea Link
 jaise hi vah varli se hote hue si link par pahunchaa to achaanak yuvak ne usase taxi rokane ko kaha
 On stopping the taxi, the young man came down and jumped into the sea

 This city of Moksha, situated on the banks of the fallen Ganges, has been resonant with the cheers of Baba Vishwanath's devotees since ancient times
 aisi manyata he ki dwadash jyotirlingon main sarvopari baba vishwanath ke darbar main hajiri lagane vaala bhakt janm-janmaantar ke chakra se mukt ho jaataa he
 But these days everything is not going well in the house of Baba who gave the blessing of salvation to the world

 He donated Rs 1,000 to the priest
 die
 According to the rules, instead of putting the donation money in the hundi (donation), the priest kept it in his pocket
 pujari kii yah karatuut sisitivi camere main kaid ho gai
 The temple administration, acting on the priest, transferred him to the Brahmakeshwar Mahadev temple in Vishwanath street outside the Kashi Vishwanath temple
 ek or pujari nilambit kar diya gaya, jo 31 july se 2 agast ke bich teen baar daan kaa paisa churaate sisitivi main najar aayaa tha
 Acting strictly on another priest involved in wrong activities, the temple administration transferred him to Mahakaleshwar Mahadev Temple in Sakaldiha
 rajya sarkaar ke mandir adhigrahan ke 32 saal bitne ke baad yah pehla mauka he, jab bhrashtachar ke chalate kaashi vishwanath mandir ke teen pujaariyon par kadi karrwai kii gai he
 Actually, the exercise to stop the step-by-step recovery from devotees in the name of Dakshina within the temple complex has brought priests and temple administration face to face
 kaashi vishwanath mandir ke pujaariyon kaa yah tark he ki 1983 main mandir ke adhigrahan ke baad se lekar ab tak mandir prashasan ke kisi adhikari ne likhit yaa maukhik rup se kisi bhi pujari par dakshina lene se roak nahin lagaai he
 On the other hand, the administration says that the priests receive honorarium from the Baqaida temple
 aise main shraddhaluon kii dakshina par unka koi haq nahin he
 The face of Kashi Vishwanath temple complex has been warmed by the presence of priests and administration on the issue of Dakshina
 farji shastriyon ke sahare pjakashi vishwanath mandir ke sanchaalan ke liye nyaas parishad or karypalak samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Till last year, Varanasi Additional District Magistrate used to work as the Chief Executive Officer of Kashi Vishwanath Temple
 november, 2014 main pehali baar sarkaar ne pisies adhikari ajay kumaar avasthi ko swatantra rup se mandir ke mukhya karypalak adhikari ke taur par tainaat kiya
 There are a total of 22 priests in the temple who worship in the sanctum sanctorum
 in pujaariyon ko 13,000 se 15,000 ru
 Monthly honorarium is available
 mandir ke garbhagrih ke baahar shraddhaluon ko puja-archana karaane kaa jimmaa 31 shastriyon kaa he, jinhen mandir kii ore se koi maandey nahin miltaa
 They collect the prescribed fee from the devotees and offer prayers in the temple premises and get Dakshina in return
 mandir kii saaf-safai ke liye 18 sevadaar bhi tainaat hai, jinhen 7,000 se 8,000 ru
 Get monthly salary
 1983 main mandir ke adhigrahan ke samay keval paanch shastri hua karte the
 In the definition of priest in section 4 (2) of 'shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act-1983', all the pandas, priests and shastras were included
 isi kii aad lekar baad main badi sankhya main ni:shulk shastriyon ko mandir main pravesh or puja-archana karwaane ke paas jari kiye gaye
 Last month, when Varanasi commissioner Nitin Ramesh Gokarn examined all the scribes, 11 scribes were found working in the temple in a fake manner
 ab in sabhi ke mandir main pravesh par roak laga di gai he
 "it is being investigated how the passes were issued to these scribes," says Gokarna
 farjivada karne waalon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 “there are two types of hundi for the donation of devotees coming to the Khelkashi Vishwanath Temple in the temple offerings
 choti hundi main geele note rakhe jate hai, jinaki ginati roj subah 10 se shaam 5 baje tak hoti he
 Large hundi are kept outside the sanctum sanctorum for gold, silver, gems etc
 isaki ginati prayek buudhvaar ko hoti he
 The pilgrims who come to the temple daily offer thousands of gold-silver bells and precious items
 lekin mandir prashasan ne pichley 15 saal se aise kisi daandaata kii na to suchi banaai or na hi unke chadhaave ko saarvajanik kiya
 Not only this, since the acquisition in 1983, only half-incomplete records up to 1999 are available with the temple administration
 maamle kii shikaayat hone ke baad prashasan mandir ke khajaane main jamaa or istemaal main laae ja chuke sone-chaandi kii vistrut jaanch kara rahaa he
 Some priests had also complained to the commissioner of manipulating the counting of temple bills
 isamen mandir ke karmchaariyon par hi ungali uthaai gai thi
 According to the earlier arrangement, the large bill was counted in the presence of a staff of the Allahabad Bank, the temple treasurer, the assistant treasury officer of the collectorate and the clerk of the temple
 choti hundi kii ginati elahabaad bank kaa staff or mandir kaa clerk milakar karte the
 After receiving complaints of cash and jewelery count disturbances, the commissioner has decided to get all types of bills counted by the temple treasurer, a staff of Allahabad Bank, Assistant Treasury Officer of Collectorate and additional executive officer of the temple
 mandir ke karmchaariyon kii bhrashtachar main sanliptata isi baat se jaahir hoti he ki yahaan kaa ek clerk aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle man visilence jaanch ke ghere main he
 There is so much property in the security Vishwanath temple, but the security here is very weak in that respect
 2007 main varanasi ke sankatmochan mandir or railway stesan par hue bam blast ke fouran baad kaashi vishwanath mandir kii suraksha badhaai gai thi
 Entry with mobiles, pens, cameras, ashala, canned goods, sharp weapons and large bags was completely banned from the temple's gate number one Dhundhiraj entrance gate, gate number two Saraswati gate and gate number four hive gate
 iske baad in pravesh dwaaron ke baahar prasad or murtiyon kii dukaan chalaane waalon ne shraddhaluon ko apane yahaan loker kii suvidha deni shuru kar di
 In order to control these, the Superintendent of Police Security Office issued a manual in 2008
 iske mutabik, sabhi loker sanchaalak mandir ke checking point se 15 meter kii duuri par honge
 Along with this, the duty of one additional jawan was imposed in every shift, who would regularly monitor the goods being kept in the locker by patrolling
 samay ke saath jab mandir main shraddhaluon kii bheed badi to prashasan ne is atirikt jawan kii duty line lagavane main laga di
 Praveen Upadhyay, who lives next to the Kashi Vishwanath temple, says, "by taking advantage of the locker not being investigated, terrorists can carry out any incident at any time
 ''is samay mandir ke dhundhiraj get par chaar loker sanchaalak checking point ke bheetar kaam kar rahe hai, jo suraksha ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 The shopkeepers themselves have taken initiative to deal with the weak security around the temple
 chhatta dwaar ke saamne prasad kii dukaan chalaane vaale rakesh kumaar goud ne aasapaas aane vaale logon par najar rakhane ke liye apni dukaan ke baahar paanch sisitivi camere lagaae hai
 At the time of the acquisition of the sluggish pace of development, the total number of devotees who came here used to be two to three lakh months, which has now increased to 15 to 18 lakhs
 jagah or suvidhaon ke sankat se guzar rahe mandir parisar main ijapha karne ke liye 2009 main daan ke paison se goyanka bhawan kharidkar isaki jagah ek nayaa complex banane kii yojana bani thi
 But in the last five years, only the Goenka Bhavan has been demolished
 mandir prashasan se jude ek adhikari kehete hai, ''suraksha kaarnon se mandir ke kinare kii galiyon main tractor-trollies le jane main asuvidha hoti he
 So construction is going on at a slow pace
 '' nirmaan se jude adhikari kaam sucharu dhang se shuru na hone ke peeche may main jari dharmarth kaary vibhaag ke ek shasnadesh kaa bhi hawala de rahe hai
 The order said that the construction work should be started only after laying the foundation stone from the Chief Minister
 goyanka bhawan kii jagah nirmaan kaary bhale hi sust gati se chal rahaa ho, lekin dharmarth kaary vibhaag ne kaashi vishwanath mandir ko sanvaarane ke liye nae sire se qamar kasi he
 (see box) It is not only about development
 adhigrahan ke baad se sarkaar kaashi vishwanath mandir ke karmchaariyon kii seva niyamavali bhi lagu nahin karvaa pai he
 "right now all the priests and shastras of the temple are Brahmins," says an officer associated with the temple administration
 seva niyamavali banane ke baad yahaan bhi aarakshan lagu ho jayega
 For fear of losing their suzerainty, the present priests are not giving permission to pass the rules from the Trust Council

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today targeted the BJP, saying that the Congress is a mass-based party, whereas the BJP is based on one person to the contrary
 rahul gandhi ne assam main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bijepi ke vipareet hamane kabhi yah nahin kaha ki kisi vyakti vishesh ko pradhanmantri banaaie, jo aapaki sabhi samasyaon ko sulajhaa sake
 For us, politics means the people and power should be in their hands
 unhone kaha ki ek chaukeedaar kyon hona chahie, jaisaa ve (bijepi) chaahate hai
 We want to make you (the public) the watchman of the country
 hindustan kii chaabi kisi ek haath main nahin, sabake haath main honi chahie
 Rahul Gandhi, who came for the third time to campaign in the state, attacked the BJP for trying to implement the 'gujarat model' across the country
 unhone kaha ki assam ko gujarat model kii jarurat nahin he
 We have the Assam model here and each state should have its own model
 unhone kaha ki gujarat main garib sapane nahin dekh sakate
 Dreams can only be seen by the rich but for the Congress every person has the right to dream
 garibon, shramikon, kisaanon ko apane bacchon ko behatar shiksha or rojgaar ke avasar milane kaa sapana dekhne kaa adhikaar he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the opposition talks about providing security to women and empowering them, but who has stopped them from doing so
 unhone kaha ki vah vipaksh hi tha, jisane mahilaon ko 33 pratishat aarakshan muhaiyaa karaane vaala mahila aarakshan vidheyak sansad main paarit nahin hone diya
 Are the results of the UP election a proof that the politics of the country's largest state has now broken the cycle of casteism? In 2014, the NDA captured 73 out of 80 seats in the state
 us vakt bhi siyaasi jaankaron ne aisi hi baat kahi thi
 So, have the assembly elections confirmed that the people of UP now vote in the name of development, not politics of identity? An analysis of the reasons behind bjp's victory sheds light on the answer to this question

 It is clear from the results that this section has relied on Modi's agenda, speech and promises

 chunnilaal thakur 1999 main or shishupal patle 2004 main yahaan se jite
 However, after delimitation, the game was reversed here in 2009
 ensipi ke ummidavaar prafull patel ne baaji maari or unke pratidwandi nirdaleey ummidavaar naanaa patole ko chunaav haraaya
 Interestingly, despite being an independent candidate in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Nana Patole finished second and bjp's Shishupal finished third
 naanaa patole kii is ilaake main pakad ko dekhte hue agle hi chunaav yani ki 2014 main bijepi ne unhen loksabhaa kaa tikat diya or wo jitkar sansad bhi pahunche
 However, he resigned after differences with the party high command

 The negligence of the civic agency in the country's capital Delhi snatched the life of a bike rider
 biker kii maut par raajnneeti bhi khub hui, lekin agenciyaan phir bhi nahin jaagin
 The PWD minister of Delhi also issued a 1077 toll-free number to deal with the problem of such pits and water logging
 mantri sahab ne daawa kiya ki shikaayat milte kii karrwai hogi
 So Aaj Tak did a reality check of the government's claim
 hamiltan road par gaharaa gadhda, logon ke liye bada khatra'aaj tak' kii team sarkaar ke daawey kii padtaal karne puranidellike hamiltan road pahunchi, jo kashmiri get se sata hua he
 There are pits on the road here or it is difficult to understand the road on the pits
 ubad-khabad gahare gadhde se hokar guzarane vaali gaadiyaan hichkole khaane ko majaboor hai
 Being a locality of the market, Hamilton Road is full of loading vehicles, rickshaws, carts, autos, along with a bicycle, motorcycle, car and a school bus filled with children
 saalon ke gadde kabhi bharte hi nahinye sadak vyast ilaakon main se ek he, lekin iske baavjood is sadak par gadhda or gadde main bharaa pani civik agency kii pole khol rahaa he
 On talking to passers-by, he told that the pits on this road have been there for many years, which never fill up
 shikaayat karne ke baavjood kabhi koi ection nahin liya gaya
 Many times there have been accidents on this road, often pedestrians find it difficult to pass through here
 rickshaw or motorcycle se guzarane vaale kai log in gaddhon kii vajah se gir chuke hai
 Seeing the situation of the helpline number of the government did not work, 'aaj Tak' decided to complain to the PWD minister on the 1077 toll free number issued by the PWD minister
 hamiltan road par hi dukaan chalaane vaale anil gabba ne apane phone se 1077 par kol kiya
 In the first time, the phone went not rich, the phone ran on the second try
 phone par baat kare rahe shaks ko sirf adress samajhane or likhane main hi 5-6 minute kaa vakt lag gaya
 Shopkeeper Anil Gabba said in his complaint that this is the pwd's road, Hamilton Road and there are huge pits on it, which can cause an accident at any time
 kai baar shikaayat hui, lekin koi nahin aayaa
 After hearing the complaint, no response was received from the helpline number
 nahin diya gaya complaint numberdukandaar anil gabba ne helpline par baithe shaks se complaint number bhi maanga, lekin jawaab aayaa kii sarwar down he or aadhe ghante main complaint number denge
 The shopkeeper then asked how long the road would be fine, so the answer was received in three days
 agar sarkaar kii helpline par shikaayat karnaa hi itnaa mushkil ho or us par bhi complaint number naa mili or aapako ye kaha jaae ki teen din main kaam hoga, to phir mantri sahab ke us daawey kaa kya jisamen unhone turant karrwai kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 Who will be responsible for any accident 'aaj Tak' spoke to the shopkeeper again after half an hour, but the shopkeeper did not get any complaint number
 dukandaar ne itnaa jarur bataaya ki complaint ke baad ek vyakti unki dukaan par aayaa or kaha kii gadde bharne kaa kaam unka nahin he
 In the investigation of 'aaj Tak', pwd's road and government's claim was exposed
 helpline number par baithe shaks ke mutabik kaam teen din main ho jayega, to aise main bada sawaal ye he ki agar teen din ke pehle is sadak paravasant kunjajaisa haadasa ho gaya, to phir uski jimmedaari koun legaa
 Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar has said that his party's alliance with the Congress was broken due to Rahul Gandhi and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan
 upie sarkaar main krishi mantri rahe maratha chhatrap ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne ensipi ko lagaataar darkinar kiya, jiske chalate unhen 15 saal kaa saath chhodana padaa
 On this, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has said that the alliance was not broken because of her or Rahul
 sharad pavaar ke taaja bayaan ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, 'na hamaari, na rahul kii, na congress kii vajah se (gathbandhan tutaa)
 'earlier NCP President Sharad Pawar said that we have been seeing for some time that Rahul Gandhi and his team people are constantly ignoring us
 vah hamaari party ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 He did this while we were also doing politics, following the fundamentals of the Congress
 aise main yah din to aana hi tha ki ham alag ho jaaen
 Chavan, avenging the defeat of '99, the NCP chief also took Chavan in the loop
 vah bole ki prithviraj jaanboojhkar ensipi ke bare main afvaahen failava rahe the
 This was pushing our credibility
 pavaar ne kaha ki hamen pichley congressi mukhyamantriyon masalan, vilasarav deshmukh, susheel kumaar scindia yaa phir ashok chavaan ke saath is tarah kii samasya nahin ai
 Pawar said that Prithviraj Chavan lost to the NCP candidate in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 vah vah usee kaa badla nikaal rahe hai
 Pawar said that the Congress is paying a political price only because of this attitude towards the alliance partners
 'ajit ke siem banane main buraai kya'pavaar se poocha gaya ki kya ensipi pichhali sarkaar main upmukhyamantri rahe unke bhattije ajit pavaar ko bataur siem candidet project karegi
 On this, he said that NCP will contest elections under collective leadership
 saath main unhone joda ki ajit pavaar kii mukhyamantri banane kii mahatvakanksha main koi buraai nahin
 'modi wave not in Maharashtra' Pawar, refusing to recognize the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an election factor, said that the Modi wave is dying in the state

 The Mumbai police first expose a drug haul of 2 thousand crores and then the name of Vicky Goswami, who was close to Dawood Ibrahim, appears as the kingpin of this drug haul
 iske baad kenya main baithi viki kii hamraaj or bollywood actress rahi mamata kulkarni kaa naam judata he
 But now this same wiki has revealed that Kimmata Kulkarni is not her wife
 ab sawaal ye he ki itane saal baad viki ke is khulaase ke aakhir kya myne hai?mamata kulkarni se ajtak kii khaas baatcheet ke anshmamta kulkarniah meraa yakeen kiijie, main ek aadhyatmik raste par hum or meraa in chizon se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 i hate drugs, hate drug users and those who do business with it
 ajtakah to aapke pati kya kaam karte hai?mamata kulkarniah main aise kisi aadmi ke saath khud ko nahin jodna chaahati, jo drug ke bijness main ho
 But i would like to say that you leave Vicky
 uske raste se hat jaaen
 i don't know what it was when i didn't meet her? But ever since i met her, i have never seen her have anything to do with drugs
 ajtak se viki goswami ne kaha- mamata nahin hai meri patniajatakah jab bhi aapkaa naam aata he, mamata kulkarni kaa bhi zikr hota he
 Vicky Goswami: Lazy
 wo ek celibrity hai or ye unke liye masala he na
 You also know, you are in journalism and are aware of these things
 lekin aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa duun ki wo meri patni nahin he
 Do you know this? Aaj Tak: So she is not your wife? Vicky Goswami: Yes, i am saying this on record
 agar koi kahata he ki wo meri patni hai, to use ye sabit karnaa chahie ki hamane kahaan shaadi kii? kisi mandir main, masjid main yaa carch main yaa phir kisi registry daftar main
 Aaj Tak: Then what is your relationship with Mamta Kulkarni? Vicky Goswami: She is my well wisher
 jab main pareshaani main tha, wo mere saath khadi thi
 This does not mean that what people are saying is correct
 wo bakawaas kar rahe hai
 People do not even know how good she is
 har baar mamata kulkarni kaa pati
 
 
 Husband of Mamta Kulkarni
 
 
 kya pati? main kasam khaataa hum
 
 maine kabhi unase shaadi nahin kii
 Mamta did not refuse to accept her husband, Aaj Tak gave this interview to Aaj Tak on Monday i
e
 May 2 while Mamata Kulkarni spoke to Aaj Tak just five days before that on Saturday, May 28
 lekin in intervyuu main viki ne jahaan mamata ko apni bivi maanane se inkaar kar diya, vahiin duusari taraf mamata ne viki ko uskaa pati bataa kar puche gaye sawaal kaa khulkar jawaab diya
 Now the question is that if Vicky is not really her husband, then why did Mamta not object to it then? 2 hajaar karod ke drugs kii vailu bataai zeeromumbai police beshak isi viki goswami ke naam par karodon kaa drug sindicket chalaane kaa aarope laga kar uskaa intjaar kar rahi ho, lekin saat samandar paar africa main baitha yahi viki police kii jaanch par hans rahaa he
 He is saying that the Mumbai police, who have recovered 23 tons of ephedrine, are telling him drugs worth 2 thousand crores, in reality, the price in the market is not full
 ajtakah oke, to thane police aapako 2 hajaar karod ke drug houl kaa kingpin bataa rahi he
 What do you have to say? Vicky Goswami: (laughs) First of all my brother
 maine aapako detail bheje hai
 Aaj Tak: OK
 viki goswamih aapako whats app par
 Its value is zero
 phir 2 hazaar karod kahaan se aae? kahaan se
 
 
 This is how the name of Vicky Goswami came in front, Mumbai Police had recently caught a person of foreign origin with half a kilogram of ephedrine, but when questioned, then the links started connecting and the name of Vicky Goswami also came up
 pataa chalaa ki kenya main baitha viki goswami darasal is drugs ke kaarobaar kaa kingpin he or wo kenya main drugs kaa jaal failaane vaala tha
 For this, he interacted with three people in India, Kishore Rathore, Manoj Jain and Jai Mukhi and gave them a contract to supply drugs
 jiske baad ye pehali kisht main 23 karod effidrin kenya bhejne ke chakkar main the, lekin isse pehle ki aisa ho paata, mumbai police ne 2 hajaar karod kii keemat kaa wo consinament baraamad kar liya
 Vicky accused of trying to implicate, however, now that Vicky said the value of that drugs is zero, he also said that he never met these people about drugs
 viki kii maane to manoj jain se uski duusare bijness ke silsile main mulaakaat hui thi jabaki kishor rathore uskaa family friend he or jab bhi wo yaa uskaa parivaar kenya ghoomane aata he, wo usase jarur milte hai
 However, in this conversation where Vicky described himself as a raw gold, gem stone and coal businessman, he also said that some people are trying to trap him
 ajtakah kya aap apane ek-do bijness ke bare main bataa sakate hai?viki goswamih main kol, panna kii khudaai or sone jaise kai kaarobaaron main hum
 Aaj Tak: Can you tell me what you had a meeting with Manoj in January, as the police are saying
 viki goswamih haa, hamaari mulaakaat hui thi
 He was talking about sleeping
 congou, tanzania, kenya main sona miltaa he
 He was asking me to get gold
 sone kaa ro material
 Vicky Goswami cannot come to India
 In this conversation, Vicky said that he is not in any wrong business but he also said that he does not want to come to Mumbai and face these charges
 viki kaa kahana he ki usne kenya sarkaar se bond bhar rakhaa he
 
 
 And he is not allowed to go out of Mombasa and there is no question of coming to India
 mamata kulkarni ne khud par lagaae aarope bataae galatis puure drug sindicket kaa kingpin jis shaks ko bataaya gaya, wo koi or nahin balki vahi viki goswami he, jise ab tak duniya mamata kulkarni ke pati ke taur par jaanati thi
 Now when the name of the alleged husband came in the business of drugs, then the wife's name was also associated in the same business, no wonder
 lekin mamata kii maane to na sirf viki bekusur he, balki wo bhi is police kii is tamaam karrwai or khud par lage tamaam iljaamon se anjaan hai
 Aaj Tak: Now it can be understood that Thane Police is making Vicky an accused in this case
 to kya aap thane police ko koi chitthee likh kar apana paksh rakhengi?mamata kulkarniah main kyon vaisaa karuungi? main aaropee nahin hum or mujhe ye bhi nahin pataa ki wo viki kaa naam kis aadhaar par le rahe hai
 i am surprised ajtakah to kya aap apana paksh rakhengi?mamata kulkarniah koi paperwork nahin, kuch nahin
 i do not know what allegations he is referring to
 ajtak ko die gaye is intervyuu main to mamata ne khud ko effidrin drugs se hi anjaan bataaya jabaki mumbai police sutron kii maane to mamata na sirf viki ke saath is dhandhe main shaamil hai, balki viki ke badale duusare mulkon main drug dealron se meeting bhi karti rahi hai
 Clearly, what the Mumbai Police has in their rights, they can tell the same, but Mamta and Vicky's attitude away from India is still intact

 com / pdv3bldzea— Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar)november 28, 2016 Restoring Section 377, which considers homosexual relations a crime, the Supreme Court said that in such cases it is not the court but the Parliament of the country that can decide
 supreme court ke justise ji es singhvi bole ki ye masalaa desh ke karodo logon se judaa he, jinka pratinidhitiv sansad main baithe janpratinidhi karte hai
 If they feel that Section 377 is wrong, then they can amend the Constitution and bring changes in it
 justise singhvi aaj hi riater ho rahe hai
 This is believed to be his last major decision
 unke saamne daleel rakhi thi ki is tarah ke faisle desh kii samskruti ke khilaaf hai
 Advocate for BJP leader BP Singhal, who filed the petition, told Aaj Tak that he had raised the issue of Indian values in a one-and-a-half-month debate and said there is no separate provision for morality in the constitution
 sirf dilli main hi hati thi chhotis dauraan bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha ki mananeey supreme court ne dilli hai court ke faisle kii vaidhaniktaa ke daayre par bhi vichaar kiya
 According to the lawyer, after the Delhi High Court's decision, Section 377 was taken away only in Delhi and homosexuality was not a crime here
 desh ke baaki hisson main yah dhara abhi bhi kaayam thi
 Did the representative of the church say that on this decision, Father Dominic, who represents the church, said that in a way it is right for us
 hamen dar tha ki isse echivi aids ke cese badhenge or aparaadh badhenge
 The Church has always been opposed to homosexual relations, but we do not consider them to be criminal
 dopaher main hi shuru hoga faisle par virodh pradarshanwaisej against artical 377 naam kii sanstha se judi dipti ne kaha ki ham supreme court ke faisle se niraash hai
 He said that after the decision of the Delhi High Court four years ago, we had seen a new hope for human rights in the country
 aage kii ranneeti par baat karte hue dipti ne kaha ki ham sansad-sadak or nyaayalay teenon morchon par ladaai ladenge
 What is Section 377? This law made in the British Raj makes unnatural sex illegal
 is dhara ke tahat kisi bhi vyakti (stri yaa purush) ke saath aprakritik yon sambadh banane par yaa kisi jaanavar ke saath yon sambandh banane par umr kaid yaa 10 saal kii sajaa va jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he

 'panchayat Aaj Tak' has been organized in Benaras on Friday amidst the electoral turmoil
 'kya kaashi piem banayega?' seshan main congress netaa rashit alvi, bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad or aam aadmi party ke ashutosh ne hissaa liya
 The session begins with Ravi Shankar Prasad
 
 
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'kaashi ek aisi nagari he jo ki aise empi ko chunane ja rahi he jo bhavi piem he
 Kashi culture is the city of culture
 kaashi ko koi jeet nahin saktaa, kaashi kaa apana mizaaj he
 There is a wave of Narendra Modi's name all over the country
 modi jis din namakan bharne pahunche log sadak par utar aae unki ek jhalak ke liye
 i have never seen such a scene before
 desh kii raajnneeti kabhi bhi nafrat kii raajnneeti nahin rahi he lekin ab aisa nahin he
 i am pained by the politics of hate and Kashi has the same mood that there is no politics of hate here
 ' is dauraan ravishankar prasad ne raashid alvi ko apana acha dost bhi bataaya
 However, Rashid Alvi responded well to these claims of Ravi Shankar Prasad
 unhone kaha, 'main ravishankar prasad ji kii baton se sahamat hum ki desh main nafrat kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 i also agree that no one can win Kashi
 gaalib ne kaha he ki kaashi main rahane vaala har aadmi ram he yaa lakshmana
 So how can the hater win from here? The name of Modi's rally is Bharat Vijay Rally
 mujhe is naam se dar lagata he
 This is what the enemies do to get victory over the country
 bharat ko koi nahin jeet saktaa he
 Nobody says BJP government, everyone speaks Modi's government
 kaashi ke andar aakar kehete hai har har modi ghar ghar modi
 What does Modi want to prove? Modi wants to be God himself? 'the country understands the power of the vote
 
 
 is par ravishankar prasad ne ek baar phir mike sambhalate hue kaha, 'congress party kaa us paar kya hoga ye to samay batayega
 Modi has spoken of taking the whole country along
 ek chaay banane vaala saadhaaran vyakti apane 14 saal ke mukhyamantri ke record ke chalate is mukaam par pahunchaa he
 Here leaders from the same family do not come
 matbhed ab manabhed ban chukaa he
 There is a need to bring down the wall of hate
 desh kaa aam naagarik vot kii takat ko samajhataa he
 With the power of vote, the public can defeat any leader, any party
 'modi kii maa ko lekar alvi ne saadhaa nishaanaa
 
 
 Alvi said, 'we see apprehension
 or isliye kyonki modi chote parivaar se uthakar aae
 We do not know what their community is? He also said that
 wo chaay bechate the or unki maa gharon main jaakar kaam karti thi ye bhi unhone hi bataaya
 But even today his mother lives in the room of 8 by 8
 unki maa auto se vot daalane gayi, jo betaa apni maa kaa khyal nahin rakh saktaa wo bharat mata kaa kya dhyaan rakhega? mujhe ganga ne bulaayaa bolkar modi kaashi aae or yahaan milane tak nahin gaye
 There is no restriction on worship
 'ravishankar prasad ne diya karaara jawaab
 
 
 He said, 'if Modi still wins, then he goes to seek his mother's blessings
 unki maa unhen aashirwad detii hai
 She lives with her cleric son, what is wrong with this
 wo auto se vot daalane jaati hai agar isamen unhen koi dikkat nahin to aapako kya dikkat he? piem banakar modi ganga ghat par jaaenge
 Worship is done in two ways, one with pretense and the other with heart
 kaashi ke sneh ko lekar yahaan aae hai narendra modi
 'ashutosh disappointed' Aam Aadmi Party's Ashutosh reached this stage a little late
 unhone aate hi kaha, 'mujhe donon netaaon kii baaten sunakar niraashaa hui he
 This forum is for serious debate
 modi or unki maa kaa rishta nijee maamla he
 But nobody talked about the problems here
 pichley 24 saalon se yahaan bijepi kii saansad jeet rahe hai
 But the condition of the roads is still poor
 ganga maili kyon he? bijli kii dikkat kyon he? trephic kii haalat itani kharaab kyon he? public transport kyon nahin he? kya desh main fasiwad aa rahaa he
 Deadly attacks are being made on people
 yahaan hinsa kii raajnneeti nahin hoti thi
 Somnath Bharti was attacked with knives
 'modi ke paas he kaashi ke vikaas kii yojana
 
 
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'narendra Modi has a plan for the development of Kashi
 hinsa kii raajnneeti galat he or aisa nahin hona chahie
 But someone should answer why this is the last time violence is happening? What is the meaning of fascism? ”who will answer on scams: Ashutosh Ashutosh then attacked BJP and Congress and said,“ Who will answer on the scams happening in the country? There have been scandals during the tenure of both Congress and BJP
 bijepi kii kisi vichaardhaara he jo jinna kii tarif karne par adwani ko adhyaksh pad se hataa diya jaataa he
 Fascism is coming inside the country
 aaj jis dabaav main media kaam kar rahaa he wo dukhad he
 a democratic tradition has to be maintained
 janata ko ye faisla lenaa hoga ki desh kaa loktantr jinda rahe yaa ek vyakti ke hi ird gird ghume
 "in response, Ravi Shankar Prasad said," Those who talk of sending media persons to jail are calling us fascists
 media ko dhamkee de rahe hai ki wo dabaav main kaam kar rahi he
 The issue is inflation, corruption, employment
 ye loksabhaa chunaav he or desh kii janata samajhati he ki kise vot dena he
 Jumping into this whole debate, Alvi said, 'issues cannot be ignored
 lekin main poochna chahta hum ki kya modi ji to athvani ji ke aansu najar nahin aae, jaswant singh ke aansu bhi nahin dikhe
 Modi ji did not even hear the voice of Sushma Swaraj's heart
 'is par karaara jawaab dete hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'bijepi kii itani chintaa kyon ho rahi he? rahul kii chintaa kiijie jinka is baar amethi se jeetna mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Worry about Manmohan Singh who said that inflation will come down in 100 days
 aaj tak nahin hui
 India has become helpless and vulnerable
 modi kii aguwai main desh acha chalegaa
 But yes, his stand against terrorism and corruption will be strong and should be

 ' Legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar, who has achieved the status of God in cricket, is 44th birthday on Monday
 22 gaj par lagbhag har ricard apane naam karne vaale sachin ko bhagwaan unki jid ne banaaya
 Stubbornness of scoring runs, stubbornness of cricket
 is jid kaa nateeja tha ki vah behad sabar ke baad aakhirkaar 2011 main apana vishwa cap jeetne kaa sapana puraa karne main safal rahe
 Wallachin, who scored about 34,347 runs in cricket, was born on 24 April 1973 in Mayanagiri Mumbai to a Marathi family
 sachin apane ghar main sabase chote or behad ziddee bhi the
 Sachin has also mentioned his stubbornness in the book written about his life
 bachapan main unke dost cycle chalaate the, lekin sachin ke paas cycle nahin thi
 He asked his father Ramesh Tendulkar, a Marathi poet, to buy a bicycle, but his father postponed it due to poor economic conditions
 is baat se sachin itane naaraaz hue kii saptaah bhar ghar se baahar khilne nahin gaye or ghar kii balakani se hi apane dosto ko cycle chalaate hue dekhte the
 Meanwhile, seeing friends riding a bicycle, his head was stuck in the balcony grill, his housemates were very upset and after about half an hour his mother put a lot of oil and took Sachin's head out of the railing
 23 saal pehle ajahar ke is faisle ne badal di thi sachin kii jindagibachapan main tha kaaphi ziddeeschin ne is ghatana kaa zikr apni kitaab 'plaing it maai ve' main bhi kiya he, sachin kii kitaab ke pehle adhyay 'childehud' main sachin ne is ghatana ko vistaar se bataaya he
 Sachin writes in his book, "I was very stubborn as a child, many of my friends had bicycles, but i did not have them
" main kisi bhi haal main cycle chahta tha
 My father did not like to say no to me
 maine jab unase kaha ki mujhe cycle chahie, to unhone mujhase kaha ki kuch dinon main vah mujhe cycle dilaa denge, aarthik taur par chaar bacchon ko paalna behad mushkil hota he
 "guess Sachin," without knowing what my father would have to do for it, i was insistent on the insistence of the bicycle and i refused to go out to play until the bicycle arrived
 main saptaah bhar tak baahar khilne nahin gaya
 i used to stand in the balcony and watch my friends
 "gril main funs gaya sirschin likhte hai, "ek din maine apane mata-pita ko daraane vaala anubhav diya
 We lived on the fourth floor, which had a small balcony and had a grill
 main uske upar se nahin dekh saktaa tha
 So i put my head in the grill for a good look outside
 main apana sir us gril main daalane main to safal rahaa lekin, main usamen sir ko baahar nahin nikaal paaya, main 30 minute tak usamen fansaa rahaa
 My family members were very upset
 kaaphi koshishon ke baad meri maa ne khub sara tel daalane ke baad meraa sir us gril main se baahar nikaala
 "sachin and '24 date 'have special connection, know how
 
 
 sachin ne kitaab main likhaa he, "meri jid ko dekhte hue or is baat ke dar se ki main kahin dobaaraa aisa kuch na kar baithun, mere pita ne kisi tarah paise ikattha kar mujhe nai cycle kharid kar di
 i do not yet know what he did for the bicycle ? ”sachin 's injury injury, however, did not make the joy of cycling much longer, because Sachin had an accident with the bicycle just hours after his arrival
 sachin ko chotein lagi thi, unke pita ne unase kaha tha ki jab tak vah puri tarah se thik nahin ho jate tab tak cycle nahin chalaayenge
 This time Sachin had to obey his father
 is baat kaa zikr bhi sachin ne apni kitaab main kiya
 Perhaps it is this stubbornness that took Sachin's journey to the 2011 World Cup victory
 haal hi main unke jivan par aadhaarit film 'sachin : e billian dollar drims' kaa trailor laanch hua he

 supreme court garbhpaat se jude kanoon kii samiksha ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 a woman with a 24-week gestation has sought an abortion from the court

 The woman says that according to doctors, the fetus growing in her womb is not normal
 uske maansik vikaron ke saath janm lene kii ashanka he

 It has also demanded that it be declared unconstitutional
 is dhara ke mutabik 20 hafte ke baad garbhpaat nahin kara sakate
 According to the petition, when this law was made in 1971, even though this section may be justified, today it is not justified because such modern technology exists which can lead to abortion even after 26 weeks
 yachika ke mutabik, bhrun main kai gambhir anuvaanshik vikaar kaa pataa 20 hafte ke baad hi chal paata he
 Therefore, not allowing abortion after 20 weeks is very strict and unfair and violates Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution

 20 hafte baad agar kisi anuvaanshik vikaar kaa pataa chalata he or koi mahila garbhpaat karana chaahati he to bhi wo is dhara ke chalate garbhpaat nahin kara sakati
 Therefore, this section ignores the physical and mental pain that the mother has in giving birth to any such child
 yachika main yah bhi maang kii gai he ki medical termination of pregnancy (amtipi) kamity kii report ko adaalat main pesh kiya jaae
 The committee consists of Health Secretary, Naresh Dayal (former Secretary, ICMR) and Dr

 The petitioner is a rape victim and she is 24 weeks pregnant

 Kashmiri IAS topper Shah Faisal, who left the civil service for politics, was taken into custody at Delhi Airport on Wednesday
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki faisal istambul jane vaale the
 He has been sent back to Srinagar, where he has been kept under house arrest under the Public Safety Act
 jammu-kashmir kaa vishesh darja samaapt karne or ise do centre shasit pradeshon main vibhajit karne ke sarkaar ke kadam ke bare main shah faisal kii soshal media par tikhi aalochana hui thi
 On Tuesday, he warned on Twitter that Kashmir "needs a non-violent political mass movement to restore political rights
" "unhone twit kiya, "kashmir ko raajnneetik adhikaron kii bahaali ke liye ek lambey, nirantar, ahimsak raajnneetik jan andolan kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The abolition of Section 370 has ended the mainstream
 samvidhanvaadee chale gaye hai
 Therefore you can either be a fundamentalist or a separatist
 "shah faisal jammu kashmir pipuls movement party ke adhyaksh hai
 After abolishing most of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Faisal had said that an unprecedented shutdown was going on in Kashmir and that its population of 80 lakh had been imprisoned, like never before
 ek anya vivaadaaspad twit main faisal ne kaha tha, "koi id nahin he
 Kashmiris around the world are mourning the illegal addition of their land
 yahaan tab tak koi id nahin hogi jab tak 1947 se jo kuch bhi chori or chhina gaya he waapas nahin lautaaya jaataa
 No Eid until every insult is avenged

 Phone and Internet services are still down in the Kashmir Valley and curfew-like restrictions
 dilli-ensiaar main diwali ke baad bade pradooshan ke baad logon kaa jivan behaal he
 Why is Delhi alone the pollution in India more than its intended quantity
 pradooshan ke liye sirf sarkaar ko doshi tehraane se kuch nahin hoga
 We have to make efforts to deal with it ourselves
 iskaa sabase acha upaay apni rog-pratirohak kshamta ko thik rakhana he or vishwaas rakhie iske liye aapako kisi dawa kaa seven nahin karnaa hoga
 We are giving some granny tips which you can deal with by adopting this situation
 1
 Drink water from the earthen pot: You remember our grandmother's grandmother used to have mud pots
 aajkal to sabhi RO kaa istemaal hi karte hai lekin mataka pani kaa PH balance barkaraar rakhte hai
 But when the water is stored in plastic then the PH balance of water deteriorates
 jis pani main phsamwuliwamawra main hota he, use pine se pet kii bimaariyaan dur rahati hai or isse rog-pratirohak kshamta bhi badhati he
 It is difficult to breathe in Delhi from pollution, to come up with a stylish mask 2
 khaane main haldi kaa prayog zyada karen:yaad he aapako bachapan main jab kabhi aapako chot lagati thi to mummy aapako haldi vaala doodh pilaati thim
 Turmeric contains anti-bacterial elements, causing the sickness to run away
 3
 Let your children walk barefoot: In this polluted environment, if you are worried that your child will fall ill, we are suggesting a good solution for this
 apane bacchon ko nange pair chalane den
 This gives your child exposure to the harmless bacteria living on the ground and gives the body the ability to fight against diseases
 badi hui qamar kahin bana na de cancer kaa marij
 
 
 4
 neem ke daatun kaa istemaal karen:toothpaste kii jagah neem ke daatun kaa istemaal karen
 If you do not get freshness from Datun, then after using brush with toothpaste, use Datun
 5
 Rub mustard oil in the navel: Although it is considered good to bring back the color of lips, but applying hot mustard oil in the navel makes the food digest well and keeps you away from diseases
 argedy netaa ne kaha he ki pichley upachunaavon me nitish kumaar kii taaqat kaa akalan ho hi chukaa he
 So far it has become clear from the behavior of the Modi government that they are not going to achieve the old status anymore
 patna vishvavidhyalay ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay kaa darja dene kii nitish kumaar kii saarvajanik hathjodi ko jis prakaar narendra modi ne jhatak diya vah sabake saamne he
 Or the demand for assistance on last year's horrific flood was unheard of, it is also evident
 isliye mujhe nahin lagata he ki nitish kumaar kii pitipitayee ranneeti ab kargar hone vaali he
 On the opposition's charge of delaying the decision on his mercy petition due to Afzal Guru being a minority community, Union Home Minister p Chidambaram on Wednesday said that religion, caste and sect are not considered while sending the mercy petition to the President and The order is followed without fear or favor
 darasal prashnkaal ke dauraan shivasena ke manohar joshi ne aarope lagaaya ki sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai lekin uski dayaa yachika par faisla karne main isliye vilamb ho rahaa he kyonki vah alpsankhyak samudaay kaa he
 Members of the ruling and left parties objected strongly to this
 joshi kii tippanee kii ninda karte hue chidambaram ne kaha ki yah tippanee asansadeey or avaanchit he
 Chidambaram said, "I do not think of religion, caste or sect while sending mercy petitions to the President
" unhone kaha ki aadesh kaa paalan bina kisi bhay yaa pakshpaat ke kiya jaataa he
 He said that no time limit has been fixed for the President for deciding mercy petitions under Section 72 of the Constitution
 chidambaram ne bhaajapa ke eses ahaluwalia ke poorak prashn ke uttar main kaha is prakriya main badlaav kaa hamen koi kaaran najar nahin aata
 It is a matter of exercising the authority of the supreme constitutional officer who is the President of India
 unke liye koi samay seemaa tay karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 He said that all the cases pending since the date of sentencing of death and the date of filing of mercy petition are once again being referred to the President
 grahamantri ne bataaya ki may 2009 ke baad unhone aise 13 maamle raashtrapati ke paas bheje the jinamein se saat main faisla aa gaya he
 These include the three convicts in the murder case of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who were sentenced to death
 do maamle aatankwaadiyon ke the jinhen maut kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 He said that the Supreme Court has given that there should not be undue delay in punishment because doing so can become the basis for change in sentence
 unhone kaha ki dayaa yachikaaon par faisle ke liye raashtrapati dwaara samay liye jane ke bare main vah koi tippanee nahin kar sakate
 He said that between 2004 and 2008, 14 cases of mercy petitions were sent to the President, out of which only two were decided
 shesh maamalon ko dobaaraa unke paas bheja jayega

 Bihar Police is not believing that the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh Police officer was detained by Patna City SP Shivdeep Lande was wrong
 haalanki is maamle kii adhikarik jaanch patna ke varisht police adhikshak jitendra rana kar rahe hai, lekin yah report agle kuch dinon main aa paaegi
 Meanwhile, on Monday, none of the senior Bihar police officials said a word in support of Lande, but assumed that the entire drama of arrests could have been avoided
 bhavishya main koi or police adhikari aisi galati naa doharaaen iske liye somvaar ko ek circular bhi jari kiya gaya, jisamen sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish dike basu ke aise maamle ke liye die gaye dishanirdesh ko paalan karne kii nasihat bhi di gai
 It is clear from looking at the key points of these guidelines that City SP Lande of Patna did not follow any point

 The votes of the Congress mlas were invalid
 The votes of many Congress mlas were invalid
 nateeja ye hua ki chunaav parinaam badal gaya
 The Congress candidates lost despite having more mlas
 kyonki unke kai mat duusare rang or gunvattta vaali syaahi se nishaan lagaae jane kii vajah se avaidh ghoshit ho gaye the
 When the votes were invalid, the mlas questioned that they had been caught holding a second pen under some conspiracy

 Equipped with international level techniques, the Election Commission has started preparing to make a special type of pen
 iske liye antarrashtriya str ke kai takneekee visheshgyon kii madad lee ja rahi he
 Because the Commission intends that both the design and ink of this pen be special
 vishesh hollmark hone se bhi ise zyada surakshit banaaya ja saktaa he
 This new system will neither copy the pen nor will there be a danger of the vote being invalid
 agle chunaav main hoga istemaalayog ke adhikariyon kii maane to do saal baad hone valerajyasabha chunaavamein nae pen se hi vot daale jaaenge

 Actually this is the last year of Modi government

 yahi nahin, avishvaas prastaav laae jane ke baad ye bhi spasht ho gaya ki vipaksh ke paas jaruri aankade nahin he
 This no-confidence motion, more than a win-win, showed the blueprint of a future political picture for 2019

 Karunanidhi said in a statement released on Friday that steps should be taken to put a complete stop to the rumors about the health of the Chief Minister
 karunanidhi ne kaha, 'jayalalita ko tej bukharaur hydration kii vajah se 22 sitambar ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The hospital claimed in a few days that Jayalalithaa's fever had subsided and she started taking a normal diet but would be kept under observation for a while
 jayalalita ne kaveri mudde par baithak bhi kii or kaveri jal sankat akjicutive meeting main padhe jane vaali chitthee ko khud likhvaya bhi
 But how can it be that the media arm of the government has not released a single photo of the Chief Minister

 Karunanidhi said that many AIDMK workers are camping outside the hospital and are in the dark about the health of the Chief Minister
 aise main kam se kam unheen ke liye mukhyamantri kii ek photo jari kii ja sakati he
 'sick for a week, nobody went to meet' According to Karunanidhi, after a week passed, the Governor or the leaders of the allies of the AIDMK did not go to see him
 is tarah jayalalita ke swasthya ko lekar jo pardaa kiya ja rahaa he wo afvaahon ko hi badhaava de rahi he
 Karunanidhi said that the police are not taking any action against those spreading the rumors
 agar mukhyamantri ko ab bhi bukhaar he to unke swasthya ko lekar ek medical team kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie or sari jaankaree logon ke saath banti jaani chahie
 According to Karunanidhi, there are political differences between him and Jayalalithaa but he wishes for her to recover soon

 congress ne GST bill ke liye laae gaye samvidhan sanshodhan bill par bahes ke dauraan sarkaar se yah bharosa maanga ki samvidhan sanshodhan bill paas hone ke baad sarkaar mul jiesti bill ko pichley daravaaje se paas nahin karaayegi
 Chidambaram said in the Rajya Sabha that we need confidence from the Finance Minister that after the passing of the Constitution Amendment Bill, the GST bill will not be passed by the Central Government as a Money Bill
 chidambaram ne kaha ki is bill par donon sadanon kii muhar laganaa jaruri he, isliye ise mani bill ke rup main nahin laayaa janaa chahie
 According to the rules, after the constitution amendment bill is passed, the government will bring the actual GST bill
 agar us bill ko mani bill ke rup main laayaa gaya, to phir rajyasabha se paas karaane kii bandish nahin hogi
 The government has a majority in the Lok Sabha and may face problems in the Rajya Sabha itself
 
 Therefore, the opposition wants the government not to bring the original bill into a money bill after passing the Constitution Amendment Bill
 
 Chidambaram also said in his speech that it should be the right of Parliament and not the government to fix the tax rate
 chidambaram ne maang kii ki sarkaar ko jiesti tex par 18 pratishat kii seemaa tay kerani chahie, taaki logon par mahangaai kaa boj na pade
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley started the debate on the constitution amendment bill for GST and said that the government has tabled in Parliament by listening to all parties and making maximum agreement

 In Davos, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has said in his inauguration speech that the youth of India is on the path of becoming a giver, not a job seeker
 naukariyon main prime time kaa yah 5waan episod bharat ke un yuvaaon ke bare main hai, jinhen naukari dene vaali sanstha naukari nahin de rahi he
 It seems that these institutions are also working on the same path that they do not give jobs to the youth of India so that they themselves find their jobs and then give it to others
 karodon kii sankhya main yuva bharat ke alag-alag rajyon ke chayan aayogon kii dhaandhlee ke shikaar hai
 Such youngsters would join hands in the production of the country from time to time, but their years are waiting for a letter
 intazaar he ki kisi ek sarkaar kii jo chayan ayog ko is str kaa bana de ki vah bhi job giver yani naukariyaan dene vaali sanstha ban jaae na ki naukariyon ke naam par yuvaaon kaa satyanaash karne vaali sanstha bani rahe
 In Bihar, BPSC students are still waiting for the result by filling the form in 2014

 Thumb impression is taken on giving mens examination, then when you give paper then thumb impression is taken

 In the fourth episode of Jobs, we showed the crises of the Jharkhand Lok Seva Commission and the State Employees Commission, how the youth are being wasted by filling up the forms, examining them
 jharkhand bijepi ke khijri se vidhayak ram kumaar paahan ne vidhaan sabha main naukariyon kaa masalaa uthaaya
 Pahan ji said that the Jharkhand Public Service Commission changes the rules repeatedly and extends the date of examination
 jiske kaaran noujvaan kii naukari paane kii umr khatm ho jaati he or ve berojgaar ho rahe hai
 He said that the government is talking about giving jobs on one side, but it is going upside down
 jharkhand main netaa vipaksh hemanth sorain ne bhi jharkhand lok seva ayog kaa masalaa utha
 We do not say that this is the effect of prime time
 naujavaanon ko naukari mili or unhen naukari dene ke naam par yah sarkari lut band ho isi main sabakaa bhala he
 i am not interested in taking credit
 itnaa zarur pataa chalaa he ki kim jong jo aaj kal apana channel chhodkar hindi channel dekh rahe hai

 Millions of youth are victims of rigging of selection commissions in different states of India
 aise yuva samay se naukariyon main aakar desh ke utpaadan main haath hi badhaate magar ek chitthee ke intazaar main unke saal tamaam ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of waiting for one government to make the selection commission to such a level that it too becomes a job giver or a job-giving institution and not an organization that annihilates the youth in the name of jobs
 bihar main to bipiessi ke chaatr 2014 main form bhar kar abhi tak nateeja aane kaa hi intazaar kar rahe hai
 Hopefully, these youth will soon come in the dreams of the Prime Minister of India and all the Chief Ministers and will take care of the dreams of these youths

 badaayun:badaayun loksabhaa seat par gathbandhan se sapa ke do baar se saansad dharmendra yadav hetric lagane utre hai
 Sanghamitra Maurya, daughter of Yogi government minister Swami Prasad Maurya from BJP, is trying his luck and former Congress minister Salim Sherwani is in the race
 2014 main modi lahar ke baavjood sapa ke dharmendra yadav jeetne main safal rahe the
 However, this time the competition seems to be triangular
 badaayun seat se dharmendra yadav kii raah main sabase bada sirdard saleem sherwani ban gaye hai
 Sherwani has been an MP from this seat four times
 jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekhen to saadhe chaar lakh muslim, dhai lakh yadav, teen lakh dalit, ek lakh jat, sava lakh brahman, ek lakh maury, ek lakh rajput matadaata hai
 If Sherwani is successful in practicing Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins, it will be difficult for Dharmendra to impose a hat-trick
 vahiin, sanghmitra maury apane samaaj ke saath-saath hindu maton ko ekajute karne main lagi hai
 Amla: In the Amla Lok Sabha seat, 14 candidates are in the fray including bjp's sitting MP Dharmendra Kashyap, bsp's Ruchivira from the alliance and Kunwar Sarvaraj Singh from Congress
 ruchivira bijanour kii rahane vaali hai unke liye ye kshetra puri tarah se nayaa he
 In such a situation, being external in their path is becoming the biggest obstacle
 vahiin sarvaraj singh is seat se saansad rah chuke hai or sapa chhodkar congress se chunavi maidan main utre hai
 Apart from this, Dharmendra Kashyap hails from this area and has a good hold in both Hindu and Muslim community
 is tarah aanwala kaa siyaasi sangram trikoniya muqabla hota najar aa rahaa he
 Looking at the ethnic equation of Amla, the maximum number of three and a half lakh Dalits, 1
5 lakh Rajputs, one lakh Brahmins, 1
5 lakh Yadavs, one lakh Jats, one lakh Lodh and two and a half lakh Muslim voters
 bareli:bareli loksabhaa seat se bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad santosh gangavar ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 While Praveen Singh Airon from Congress and Bhagwat Sharan Gangwar from SP have fielded
 pichley teen dashak se is seat par bijepi kaa ecchhatra raaj rahaa he
 Santosh Kumar Gangwar has won the election battle from this seat seven times, hence SP has played bet on Bhagwat Sharan Gangwar, but SP has never won this seat
 bareli ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen sabase zyada paanch lakh muslim, saadhe teen lakh kurmi, teen lakh kurmi, sava lakh rajput, sava lakh brahman or do lakh vaisya matadaata hai
 Pravin Aran of Congress won as Congress candidate in 2009
 aise main ek baar phir muslim or vaisya sameekaran ke jariye ek baar phir gangavar ko maat dena chaahate hai
 Pilibhit: Pilibhit Lok Sabha seat is considered the traditional seat of bjp's 'gandhi'
 is seat par pichley teen dashak se indira gandhi ke duusare bete sanjay gandhi kii patni menka gandhi or bete varun gandhi kaa hi raaj rahaa he
 BJP has once again fielded Varun Gandhi from Pilibhit seat
 sapa ne is seat par hemraj verma ko utaara he
 The Congress has given this seat to Krishna Patel's Apna Dal
 pilibhit seat par bijepi banaam sapa kii sidhi ladaai hoti najar aa rahi he

 buudhvaar ko istipha dene ke baad guuruuvaar ko subah 10 baje nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee, unke saath susheel modi ne bhi upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 a photo of Nitish is again in discussion as soon as Nitish forms the government with the BJP
 jisamen nitish kumaar ek camel ke phool main rang bharte hue najar aa rahe hai
 Now after about 6 months it has become true that Nitish Kumar has formed a government with the BJP
 isi varsh farvari main prakaash parv ke dauraan nitish ne ek painting main rang bharaa tha, jiske baad kaaphi bavaal hua tha
 Many meanings were taken of this picture
 mauka tha patna main yojit pustak meley kaa prakaash parv ke avasar par pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi patna gaye the or nitish ke saath manch saajha kiya tha
 During this, he also praised Nitish Kumar
 machaa tha siyaasi bavaalus dauraan bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne photo viral hone par kaha tha ki nitish iske jariye apane raajnneetik rang bhar rahe the
 He keeps showing Lalu ji again and again that he is independent
 vahiin bihar up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki camel sirf bijepi kaa nahin he, laalaten (argedy kaa chunaav chinh) kitne gharon main ujaalaa karti he
 If anyone is happy with this then it is good
 bataa den ki buudhvaar shaam ko siyaasi drame kaa ant kuch aisa hi hua ki bihar kii raajnneeti main sabakuch badal gaya
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was in power, resigned due to allegations of corruption on Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav

 When the House began in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu praised former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh kaa rajyasabha main kaarykaal khatm ho gaya he, unhone unke yogadan ke liye shukriya adaa kiya
 During his address to the Rajya Sabha, Venkaiah Naidu said, "as a Leader of the House and Leader of the Opposition, he made an outstanding contribution to the Rajya Sabha
 ’ unhone kaha ki sadan main hameshaa unki kami khilegi, ham unke achche bhavishya or swasthya kii kaamana karte hai
 Significantly, Manmohan Singh's term in Rajya Sabha has ended on June 14
 yahi kaaran he ki is baar vah sadan main nahin dikhaai denge
 He has been a five-time Rajya Sabha MP from Assam, when he was the Prime Minister, he also came from the Rajya Sabha
 15 june, 2013 ko unka aakhri kaarykaal shuru hua tha jo 14 june ko khatm hua
 However, this time it is being speculated that the Congress party is constantly engaged in efforts to send Manmohan Singh back to the Rajya Sabha
 lekin congress party ke liye ye raah aasaan nahin he kyonki assam main is baar unke paas itane vidhayak nahin hai ki unke khate main rajyasabha seat bhi aa sake
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress is soon trying to send Manmohan Singh to the Rajya Sabha from those states where it has seats
 lekin ye mauka bhi kai dinon ke baad hi aa saktaa he
 Because by April 2020 only Rajya Sabha elections are going to be held in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Assam, Jharkhand, Rajasthan
 rajasthan main congress ke paas acchhee sankhya he aise main vahaan se unhen bheja ja saktaa he

 The central government has got a big relief during the election season
 chunaav ayog kii taraf se manaregaa mazdooree kii daron badhaane kii manjuuri mil gai he, haalanki isamen shart lagaai gai he ki inkaa istemaal chunaav prachaar ke dauraan nahin hoga

 darasal, manaregaa yojana ke tahat mazdooree ko daron ko badhaane ke liye centre sarkaar ne chunaav ayog se anurodh kiya tha
 On which the news of relief has come from the Election Commission

 That is, the ruling party cannot ask for votes in the BJP campaign saying that they have increased the wage rates
 ab ek april se manaregaa yojana ke tahat mazdooree ko sanshodhit kiya ja sakegaa
 In fact, as the code of conduct came into force, the ministry had asked the commission to revise wages under the MGNREGA scheme

 It is worth noting that recently, the Election Commission had earlier issued a notice to the government, with the slogan of 'chowkidar', the film being made on PM Modi

 If anyone deserves 5 years of success of our government, then it is the people of India
 bharat kaa matadaata he
 The people of Odisha are odisha kaa matadaata he
 PM Modi said these things at an election rally held in Koraput, Odisha
 piem modi ne kaha ki aaj main puure desh kaa bhraman deshavaasiyon kaa dhanyavad karne ke liye niklaa hum kyonki deshavaasiyon ne mujhe aashirwad na diya hota to aaj jo kaam dikh rahaa he wo main kaise kar paata
 In a public meeting held in Koraput, Odisha, PM Modi attacked the Odisha CM fiercely
 piem modi rajya kii naakamayaabi ke liye naveen patnayak ko doshi tehraaya
 PM Modi said that Odisha has got about 6 and a half thousand rupees in the District Minerals Fund but the government here has been able to spend only 1 thousand crores
 kya aisi sarkaar jo aapke paise ko tijori main band karke baith gai he, use janaa chahie yaa nahin? piem modi ne kaha ki piem kisaan sammaan nidhi ke tahat desh ke jin 12 karod kisaan pariwaron ko ham sidhi madad bank khate main de rahe hai, har varsh 75 hazaar karod rupye bank khate main jamaa kar rahe hai, unamem se ek bhi odisha kaa nahin he
 Because the government here has not yet given the list of beneficiaries
 piem modi ne apni sabha main kaha ki odisha ke garib, adivasee pariwaron ko hamaare prayaason kaa us tezi se laabh nahin ho paa rahaa, kyonki yahaan bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar nahin he
 We are working on opening hospitals in major panchayats across the country
 piem modi ne kaha ki deshbhar main dedh lakh welnes centre banaae ja rahe hai
 We have accelerated the process of vaccinating children and maternal mothers in every village
 beete 7 dashakon main jinhone yahaan sarkarein chalaai hai, unhone odisha ko garibi or bhukhmaree ke alaava kya diya? piem modi ne kaha ki garibon or adivaasiyon ke naam par yojanaayen banati hai lekin bichauliye or dalal uskaa phayda lut le jate hai, or asli labhaarthi haath malataa rah jaataa he
 This has been the condition of his plans
 piem modi ne kaha ki jab ham or aap chaukas hokar chaukeedaari karenge, tabhi bhrashtachari or atyaachaari darenge
 Your watchman is with you for your work, for your campaign
 piem modi ne raily main aae logon se poocha ki kya jinke raaj main betiyaan surakshit nahin he, betiyon par atyaachaar karne waalon ko sazaa dene main jo naakaam rahe hai, aise log odisha ko surakshit or majboot bana paaenge kya? kya chitfund main ghotaalaa karne vaale, garibon kii pai-pai apni tijori main bharne vaale odisha ko majboot bana paaenge? kya adivaasiyon kii sampada, aapke sansadhano par, koraput, raigarh yahaan ke tamaam adivasee anchalon main khanan mafia ko badhaava dene vaale, aise log odisha ko majboot bana sakate hai kya? piem modi ne kaha ki odisha majboot tab banegaa jab yahaan kaa adivasee, yahaan kaa kisaan, yahaan kaa noujvaan, aage badhegaa
 When the Bharatiya Janata Party will be in government both here in the state and at the center
 jab sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas hoga, tabhi odisha majboot hoga, purvi bharat majboot hoga, puraa bharat majboot hoga
 PM Modi said that this election of 2019 is not just the election of an MP, not just the election of an MLA
 ye chunaav centre or rajya main vikaas kaa dabl ingine lagane vaali bhartiya janata party kii sarkaron ke chunaav kaa samay he
 This is a choice to build a new Odisha and a new India in the coming 5 years
 aapako tay karnaa he ki jo sarkarein naksali hinsa par kaabo nahin paa saktin, jo uske aage kamjor najar aati hai, unhen kya sazaa deni he
 You have to decide what punishment should be given to the Congress to whom you entrusted the responsibility of development of Odisha for decades, the BJD, who gave so long time for development
 piem modi ne logon se kaha ki matdaan ke din jab aap poling booth jaaenge to ek spasht man banaakar jaaiega
 In a public meeting held in Koraput, PM Modi also referred to the surgical strike carried out in Pakistan's terrorist camp and said that you have to decide whether a government should be killed by terrorists, or a government that can sit in panic
 aapako ye tay karnaa he ki nirnay karne vaali sarkaar chahie yaa sirf naare dene vaali sarkaar
 PM Modi said that the people who have been traitors to the poor for seven decades, have become so angry that the scientists of the country, the army of the country, the power of the youth of the country, have started insulting everyone
 jab bharat aatankiyon par karrwai karata he, unhen ghar main ghuskar martha he, to bhi ye log saboot maangate hai
 He said that two days ago, Odisha has become a witness to such a historic achievement, which has made the whole world aware of the power of India
 bharat ab antariksh main bhi chaukeedaari karne main sakasham he
 i have reached the Panchadhara of development i
e
 education for children, medicine for the elderly, earning for the youth, irrigation to the farmers and hearing to the people, for this i have made every effort

 There are no set criteria for this
 ye tay karnaa state cameti or chunaav samiti kaa adhikaar he

 baavariyaa ne saaf kar diya ki loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar party kaaphi gambhir he
 Congress is back in power after 15 years in the state, expectations of all have risen
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main samaan vichaardhaara ke logon se gathbandhan hone kii sambhaavna ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa, lekin abhi tay nahin he

 An affidavit from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) in the Delhi High Court has raised serious questions over the claims of the Health Ministry
 tippaniyan In an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court, the Health Ministry had said that disclosure of corruption cases in AIIMS would affect the investigation, but the CVC, which has heard the cases against corruption, has given a complete status report to the court
 sivisi ne court ko jo jaankaree di he, usase pataa chalata he ki bhrashtachar ke bahut se maamalon kii jaanch isliye ataki he, kyonki swasthya mantralay kii ore se zaruri kaarywahi nahin kii ja rahi
 In these cases of corruption, Himachal cadre IAS officer Vineet Chaudhary has also been the deputy director administration in AIIMS and is currently the chief secretary of Himachal Pradesh
 sivisi kii ore se court ko di gai jaankaree ke mutabik choudhary ke khilaaf jaanch khud kendriya swasthyamantri je pi nadda ke hari jhandi na dene kii vajah se jaanch rukii he
 It is worth noting that the Center for Public Interest Litigation, an organization, had filed a petition in the court that Union Health Minister JP Nadda should separate himself from corruption cases in AIIMS, as an MP he had asked former Health Minister Harsh Vardhan He was asked to stop investigating these cases
 yachika main ye bhi maang kii gai thi ki sibiai or sivisi se in maamalon kii sheeghra jaanch ke liye kaha jaae
 Let us tell you that the former CVO of AIIMS, Sanjeev Chaturvedi, exposed many corruption cases in the institute, whose investigation reached the court regarding laxity
 pichley dinon dilli hycourt ne swasthyamantri je pi nadda ko nijee haisiyat main notice jari kiya tha
 Apart from Nadda, notices were also sent to the Health Ministry, CVC, CBI, AIIMS Director and Sanjeev Chaturvedi
 jahaan swasthya mantralay ne court ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke taaja states kii jaankaree dene se jaanch prabhavit hogi
 At the same time, the CVC has given information about 21 cases in its report and has also given the status of each case
 centre main pichley saal nai sarkaar banane ke baad sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya, jisase kaaphi vivaad khadaa hua tha
 NDTV India had shown you the news that JP Nadda, then MP, not only wrote letters to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove Chaturvedi, but also said that investigation into corruption cases in AIIMS, which Chaturvedi exposed Have done
 nadda ne centre sarkaar ko ames main apni pasand ke nae sivio kaa naam bhi sujhaayaa tha
 The Union Health Ministry in its affidavit to the court has said that the removal of Chaturvedi from the CVO post of AIIMS has not affected the investigation of corruption cases
 udhar nadda ne court se kaha he ki unhone ek saansad kii haisiyat se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko rivyuu karne ke liye kaha, kyonki chaturvedi kii niyukti hi sivio pad par galat thi
 Nadda also said that he has no connection with Vineet Chaudhary and is not trying to influence the investigation of corruption cases at AIIMS
 dilli hycourt ko die halafname main swasthya mantralay ne kaha tha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke bare main khulaasa karne se jaanch main asar padegaa, lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf maamle sunne vaali sivisi ne court ko is bare main ek mukammal states report di he
 The information given by the CVC to the court shows that investigation of many cases of corruption is stuck because the necessary action is not being taken by the Ministry of Health
 bhrashtachar ke in maamalon main himachal kader ke iees adhikari vineet choudhary kaa naam bhi he jo ames main dipti diarector administration rah chuke hai or abhi vah himachal pradesh ke mukhya sachiv hai
 According to the information given by the CVC to the court, the investigation against Chaudhary itself has stalled due to non-clearance of Union Health Minister JP Nadda
 gauratlab he ki ek sanstha centre for public interest litigeshan ne court main yachika daayar kar kaha tha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon se kendriya swasthyamantri je pi nadda ko khud ko alag kar lenaa chahie, kyonki ek saansad ke taur par unhone purv swasthya mantri harshavardhan se in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ko kaha tha
 It was also demanded in the petition that the CBI and CVC be asked to investigate these cases quickly
 aapako bataa den ki ames ke purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ne santhaan main bhrashtachar ke kai maamle ujagar kiye jinaki jaanch main dhilaai ko lekar maamla adaalat tak pahunchaa
 Recently, the Delhi High Court issued a notice to Health Minister JP Nadda in a private capacity
 nadda ke alaava swasthya mantralay, sivisi, sibiai, ames ke nideshak or sanjeev chaturvedi ko bhi notice bheje gaye
 Where the Health Ministry said the court said that giving information about the latest status of corruption cases will affect the investigation
 vahiin sivisi ne apni report main 21 maamalon ke bare main tafsil se jaankaree di he or har maamle kaa states bhi bataaya he
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi was removed from the post of CVO of AIIMS after the formation of a new government at the Center last year, causing much controversy
 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki us vakt bataur saansad je pi nadda ne na sirf chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye swasthya mantri harshavardhan ko chitthiyaan likhi, balki yah bhi kaha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke un maamalon kii jaanch roki jaae, jo chaturvedi ne ujagar kiye hai
 Nadda had also suggested to the Central Government the name of the new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 kendriya swasthya mantralay ne court ko die halafnaam main kaha he ki chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataae jane se bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch main koi asar nahin padaa he
 On the other hand, Nadda has told the court that he asked the status of an MP to review the corruption cases in AIIMS, because the appointment of Chaturvedi as CVO was wrong
 nadda ne yah bhi kaha ki unka vineet choudhary ke saath koi sambandh nahin he or vah ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii koshish nahin kar rahe
 Apart from Nadda, notices were also sent to the Health Ministry, CVC, CBI, AIIMS Director and Sanjeev Chaturvedi
 jahaan swasthya mantralay ne court ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke taaja states kii jaankaree dene se jaanch prabhavit hogi
 At the same time, the CVC has given information about 21 cases in its report and has also given the status of each case
 centre main pichley saal nai sarkaar banane ke baad sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya, jisase kaaphi vivaad khadaa hua tha
 NDTV India had shown you the news that JP Nadda, then MP, not only wrote letters to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove Chaturvedi, but also said that investigation into corruption cases in AIIMS, which Chaturvedi exposed Have done

 "in the Lok Sabha elections, BJP leaders were indirectly advancing the agenda of Hindutva by talking about the security of the country and 'sneaking into Pakistan'," Chaudhary says
 doordaraj ke anchalon or gramin ilaakon main yah baat asar kar rahi thi
 In order to cut the SP-BSP-RLD alliance on the unilateral support of Jatavs, Muslims and Yadav castes, the BJP woven the support of those castes whose numbers constitute around 60 per cent of the total population
 agadi jatiyon se 32 or pichhadi jatiyon se 29 ummidavaaron ko maidan main utarkar santulan saadhaa gaya
 16 Brahmin and 13 Kshatriya candidates were also removed and reconciled among the forward castes

 In the 17 reserved Lok Sabha seats of the state, BJP placed bets on its traditional Pasi, Valmiki caste candidates
 agadi jatiyon ke 23 ummidavaar, 15 dalit ummidavaar or 24 pichhadi jatiyon ke bhaajapa ummidavaar vijayi rahe
 Apart from reserved seats, once again BJP candidates from backward castes performed better

 The BJP took Sanjay Nishad, the president of the Nishad Party, which has a dozen seats in Purvanchal, to counter the rebellion of Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of bjp's Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party and cabinet minister in the state government
 gorakhpur se sapa ke tikat par loksabhaa up-chunaav jeetne vaale sanjay nishad ke putr praveen nishad ko bhaajapa ne sant kabir nagar se ummidavaar banaaya
 Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who emerged as the backward face of BJP in the 2017 assembly elections, held close to a hundred rallies in the state during the Lok Sabha elections

 The result was that the BJP got the votes of every section of the backward castes along with the Yadavs

 *** RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was sent to Ranchi's Birsa Munda jail on 23 December after being convicted in another case of fodder scam
 ab is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki lalu ke doshi qaraar die jane se or birsa munda jail main bheje jane se pehle hi lalu ke do sevadaaron ne birsa munda jail main entry le lee thi
 After the entire case was revealed, RJD Nalaluka defended that two persons named Laxman Mahato and Madan Yadav, who had reached jail after Lalu's conviction in another case before Lalu reached jail on December 23, These were party workers and not Lalu's personal servants
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue argedy ke vidhayak or pravaktaa shakti singh yadav ne is baat par kadi aapatti jataai he
 Shakti Singh Yadav has challenged that if there is any footage of Laxman Mahato and Madan Yadav serving Lalu inside the jail, then it should be brought immediately
 nahin to aise anargal aarope na lagaaein ki lalu jail ke andar nijee sevadaaron se apni seva karvaa rahe hai
 Shakti Singh Yadav denied that Laxman Mahato is Lalu Yadav's personal cook and lives inside Lalu Awas 10, Circular Road in Patna
 shakti singh ne kaha ki lakshmana mahato keval party kaa ek kaaryakarta he
 Another RJD leader and MLA Harishankar Yadav said that he is ready to go to jail for Lalu Prasad
 ajtak se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki agar court aadesh kare to vah lalu ke liye kisi bhi vakt ranchi cabirsa munda jailja sakate hai
 Harishankar Yadav said that thousands of party workers are ready to go to Sadar jail for Lalu
 vahiin, duusari taraf jadyu ne is puure maamle par bolte hue kaha ki lalu saamaajik nyaay kaa paakhand karne main maahir hai
 Senior party leader and MLC Neeraj Kumar said that Lalu Yadav gets poor people to write their land and also serve them
 niraj kumaar ne maang kii he ki jharkhand sarkaar is puure maamle kii turant jaanch kare or jin police afasaron ne lalu ke donon sevadaaron ko jail pahunchane main bhoomika adaa kii thi un par karrwai kii jaae
 JDU has also demanded that Lalu should shift from Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi and send him to Hazaribagh's Open Jail after this whole matter comes to light
 mukhya chunaav ayukta vies sanpat ne ravivaar ko suzav diya ki ped news ko chunavi aparaadh banaaya janaa chahie jiskaa doshi paae jane par sadsyta ke liye ayogy tehraae jane kii sajaa honi chahie taaki yah pratirohak ke taur par kaary kare
 He said that due to lack of legal framework, the Election Commission is not able to curb this effectively
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan rajnatik dalon ke kharchon se sambandhit ek spasht kanoon kii jabardast aavashyaktaa he kyonki isaki gaiyr maujuudagi main partiyaan or unke ummidavaar niyamon ko dhata bataate hai
 In a session organized by the Law Commission, Sampath said that when the Election Commission investigated whether it had the powers to deal with paid news, it found a negative answer
 unhone kisi bhi swaroop yaa naam se ‘ped news’ philhal chunavi aparaadh nahin he
 He said, 'if it is an electoral offense then ultimately the candidate will be disqualified
 karyanvayan main chaahe jo kathinaayee ho lekin agar ise chunavi aparaadh main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he to chunaavon main iskaa istemaal kar rahe logon ke khilaaf yah pratirohak ke taur par kaam karegaa
 The CEC said that a recommendation in this regard has been made to the Law Ministry
 sanpat ne is baat par bhi aashcharya jataayaa ki chunaavon ke dauraan sarkari vigyapanon ko kyon nahin ped news mana janaa chahie
 As paid news is not an electoral offense, the Election Commission now tries to curb this problem by using its powers related to candidates' expenditure
 unhone kaha ki agar koi ummidavaar pakadaa jaataa he to vah raashi us ummidavaar ke kharch main jodi jaati he
 However, he claimed that the candidates have found a way out of it if caught
 sanpat ne kaha, ‘jab ve ummidavaar apana kharch kaa ritern daakhil karte hai to ve hameshaa is tarah kii chizon ke liye gunjaaish bachaakar rakhte hai
 If a limit of Rs 40 lakh was set in those days, then no candidate would file a return of more than Rs 25 lakh
 vah 15 lakh rupee kii gunjaaish iske liye rakhata tha

 ashwin-jadeja's disappointing performance After the Sri Lanka tour, South Africa also toured India with their strong balls on the tour of South Africa
 unki bowling kaa aisa khauf tha ki abi divilliars, hashim amala, phalf du placi jaise ballebaaj bhi protiyaaj ko clin sweep se nahin bachaa sake
 Ashwin's performance in the Indian subcontinent gave him the number one bowler title in Tests
 lekin jab ye test kaa number ek bowler australia ke khilaaf unki sarajameen par khilne utraa to isaki wo dhunaai hui ki logon ko shaq hone laga ki ye aswin hi he
 Ashwin has bowled 19 overs in this series so far, including 6
 73 kii iconmi se 128 ran lutaate hue mahaj do wicket jatke hai
 Apart from these, Ravindra Jadeja, who bowled tremendously in the series against South Africa, also got 6 in his 18 overs
 16 kii iconmi se 111 ran lutaate hue bas ek wicket hasil kar paae hai
 Now if your main bowler does not take a wicket while scoring runs so generously, then who can win you
 pes bydaree kaa ekadam se down rahanaahaalanki is daure main australian pichon main wo teji nahin he jiske liye wo jaani jaati hai
 But even if your paces do not take wickets, then how will it work
 team india ke mukhya tej gendbaajon ke ab tak ke aankade niraashajanak hai
 Umesh Yadav 20 overs 128 runs one wicket
 eshanth sharma 10 over 60 ran ek wicket
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar 9 overs 42 runs no wickets
 aapke mukhya teen anbhavi tej gendbaaj agar aisi bowling karenge to vipakshi team ke liye aadha kaam to vaise hi ho gaya
 Barinder Saran, who made his debut on this tour, has bowled quite well so far
 haalanki unhen duusare vanade main koi wicket nahin mila lekin is siries main unke overol aankadon kii baat karen to ek nae bowler ke ye aankade nishchit taur par saraahneey hai
 Barinder is 18 so far on this tour
 2 over main 107 ran dete hue teen wicket apane naam kiye hai
 Barinder, the highest wicket-taker for India in this series, is also the only bowler to throw a maiden over from the Indian team
 slog overon main dhimi battingeth wicket haath main rakhkar agar aap aakhri ke das overon main maatr 75 ran jodenge to jeet to aapako milane se rahi
 Significantly, in the last ten overs, Team India hit 6 fours and a six, less than one boundary per over
 inamen se paanch chauke or ek chakka to akele rahane ne hi jamaa die the
 Now the thing to think is that Dhoni, considered one of the most powerful finishers in world cricket, Manish Pandey, the first Indian century Indian IPL, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, together will make a four in the slog overs, but Lootia has to be drowned
 inke alaava rahane ke out hote hi jaise sabhi ko vaapasi kii jaldi ho gai thi
 After Rahane, Pandey in the same over and then Ashwin in the next over, Jadeja departed slowly
 pehla match 307 banaakar haarane ke baad bhi slog overon main aapkaa ye atitude aapako dubaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Bad fielding of 'flamboyant' fielders R
 Fielding coach of Team India
 shridhar kii maane to team india kii maujuuda ilevan fielding main bahut hi acchhee he
 He said in November last year, "ravindra Jadeja is a natural athlete
 hamaari team main prayek khilaadi kuch hatakar karata he jisase vah samuhik taur par acchhee kshetrarakshak ikai ban gayi he
 Also Virat is energetic, Ajinkya is agile as a close fielder
 koi shantchit rahata he to shikhar gajab kaa athlete he
 So it is a very good team in fielding
 ' ab agar shridhar kii baton ko sach maane to nishchit taur par wo kisi or hi team kii baat kar rahe the
 Because this team has missed many easy catches and runout opportunities
 is team kii fielding kii haalat dayaneey thi
 It did not seem that this is the same team Sridhar whose fielding praise does not get tired
 agar ham ye kahen ki rohit sharma ke do shatak, kohli ke do ardhashatak or rahane ke 89 ranon par pani pherane vaale yahi mukhya kaaran hai to isamen kuch galat nahin hoga
