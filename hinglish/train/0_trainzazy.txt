 The relationship between America and India has always been full of ups and downs
 kabhi america bharat ke kareeb ho jaataa he to kabhi dur
 It is known by all that India increased the non-aligned Movement after independence, which America never liked
 vah chahta tha ki bharat uske gut main shaamil ho lekin bharat ne soviet sangh kaa daaman thame rakhaa jo 1991 main uske vighatan tak bana rahaa
 Only then did India move towards the us-europe
 aisa nahin tha ki donon main talkh rishte the
 At the time of President John F
 Kennedy, the two countries had very good relations
 lekin baad ke varshon main vah madhurata nahin rahi
 The reason was that America's inclination was always towards Pakistan and later its relations with China also improved
 lekin 9 / 11 ke baad america kii soch main badlaav aayaa or chijen badalane lagi
 indo-us became closer to each other
 donon ke bich kai mahatvapurn samjhaute bhi hue
 But in this path of friendship, the pit also got very much
 america main ek aisi lobby bhi he jo bharat ke liye pareshaaniyaan paidaa karti rahati he
 a large example of this was seen in the US H-1B (temporary) visa as a number of restrictions
 aisa nahin tha ki isse donon ke sambandhon par asar padaa lekin kuch khathaas to dikhi
 US President Barack Obama also visited India and tried to strengthen relations but India did not agree with his attitude towards Taliban and Pakistan
 iske alaava outsorcing ke maamle main donon ke sambandh katu rahe
 Obama does not want India outsourcing from the US
 unka maananaa tha ki isse america main rojgaar ke avasar kam ho rahe hai
 But in spite of this the proximity of the two continued to grow on the business front and today there is about 63 billion dollars of annual trade between the two countries
 lekin devayani khobragade cond ke baad to jaise ki donon ke sambandhon main daraar aa gai
 It was such an incident that caused a rage in the Indian public towards America
 vah maamla to philhal kaamchalaoo dhang se sulajh gaya he lekin talkhi barkaraar he
 The American government realizes this
 lekin usase bhi badi baat yah he ki america ko lag rahaa he ki bharat main ab satta parivartan hoga or narendra modi pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 In such a situation, he feels the need to change his policies towards India
 america kootneeti kaa chatur khilaadi he or use vakt kii najaakat kaa ahsaas bhi he
 He knows that if anyone can help him stop China's growing dominance in Asia, it is India
 china ne pakistan se apane sambandh phir se sudhaarna shuru kar diya he or is samay vah vahaan hajaaron karod dollar kii pariyojnaon par kaam kar rahaa he
 China is completely tying Pakistan on the brink of economic insolvency
 aise main america ko bharat main ek mahatvapurn partner dikhataa he
 He cannot ignore it
 bharat na keval uskaa bada kaarobaari saajheedaar he balki sainya kshetra main bhi bada sahyogi
 America needs India at this time
 nai sarkaar ko pehle se khush rakhana usee ranneeti kaa ek hissaa he

 Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone got a sense of how angry she was after reading her tweets on 14 September
 ek pratishthit angreji akhbaar kii foohad 'khabar' kaa twitor par unhone aisa jawaab diya ki padhane vaale dang rah gaye
 Now Deepika has put up a post on Facebook which will increase her respect by reading
 'maai point of vyuu' naam se is post main deepika ne likhaa- 'ek mahila shaareerik sambandh banane ke liye raji he iskaa sirf ek hi ishaara he ki jab wo 'haa' bole
 Everyone knows how vigorously we are trying to change the thinking of a fixed society in the country and how we are trying to move towards a happy world in which things like inequality, rape, fear and pain Don't be mujhe achche se apane kaam ke bare main pataa he, meraa kaam bahut demanding he jo mujhase bahut kuch karwaanaa chahta he
 There may be a demand for a role that i stay covered from head to toe or get completely naked and then as an actor it will be my decision whether i want to do it or not
 yah fark samajhnaa hoga ki role or real main antar hota he or meraa kaam mujhe die gaye role ko acchhee tareeke se nibhaana he
 Read: Deepika asked, 'I am a woman, i have breasts, you have a problem?' i think i am writing clearly so that it does not get confused with Shahrukh's atpacks and the body texture of a woman
 maine ek aisi vichaardhaara ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he jo hamen peeche dhakel rahi he or jiskaa sahaara logon kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he wo bhi aise daur main jab ham mahilaon ke liye samanta kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 At a time when women are making a place in a society dominated by men and for which they should be praised, we are erasing the line between real life and cinema and by presenting a year old thing as news Spoiling all efforts
 ek puraani khabar nikaalkar uski hedline 'OMG: deepika clivej sho' dena pichhadi soch ko badhaava dekar takat kaa galat istemaal karnaa he
 If the clothes of an actress go here and there, it should not be assumed that she would have done this intentionally
 aise main camere ko juum karne or us vishesh hisse ko gol ghere main daalane or us par khaas dhyaan dilwane ke liye tir kaa nishaan banane se behatar hoga ki ham us actress ko thodaa sammaan den or aisi baton ko jane den naa ki un par hedline banaaen
 Are we not human? Yes, it is such that in films we are happy to see the hero's atpack abs, but when he comes in the public, can we make such a cheap headline by zooming the camera on his crotch (the middle part of both thighs)
 Are you? 'I have never run away from playing any role and neither have i had any problem with the news made about my body
 main apni aane vaali film main ek baar dancer kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hum
 (I apologize to Farah Khan for making this thing public
 )breast yaa sharir ke kisi or hisse par khabar banane kii baat nahin he
 The issue is in which context the news is being made or how much its context is being changed to sell the news
 wo bhi aise main jabaki mahilaon ko lekar soch main badlaav kii bahut jarurat he
 This thing ends here for me
 har kisi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 i think if it is stretched longer then this issue will get irresponsible
 ise or todaa-maroda ja saktaa he jisase or ulti-sidhi khabaren ban sakati hai

 police ke mutabik is vaardaat ko anjaam dene main dakait kaaphi lambey vakt se lage honge
 In a similar incident earlier, the dacoits in a bank branch in Kerala dug a floor of the building and made their way to the Strong Room and stole an amount of around eight crores including 80 kg of gold from there
 baad main dakaiton ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha or unke sargana ne kabool kiya tha ki unhone ek hindi film dekhakar chori kaa yah idia apanaaya tha
 Democracy is in danger, we need freedom, communal forces, secularism, right to speak, fascists, women's rights, and what not? These are just some of the words that are quite popular in the gang of six intelligent people
 in kuchhek shabdon ko retie or dijie siyaasi gyaan
 Neither the trouble of reading big theory nor the taste of understanding their meaning
 haa, geoup par kaam kiye bina aap is jamaat main shaamil nahin ho paaenge
 Like pure cotton saree but the brand should be international
 julri antic hi ho
 Men are colorful kurtas and bearded, but not in the same style
 sarkari yojanaon kii aalochanaon ke liye kisi visheshgy kii tarah maathe par bal daalkar aawaaj main baaripan laakar bas itnaa kahana he, sarkaar taanashaah ho gai he
 The attitude of such a leader is fascist
 taanaashaahee nahin chalegi
 Democracy is in danger
 vagairah vagairah
 And then see the effect! There must be a special kind of seriousness on your face
 mudda kuch bhi ho in shabdon kii chaashni banaakar bhav-bhangima ke rasagulle dubokar bas phenk maariye saamne vaale par
 But do these people who are knowledgeable and critical of every issue get into the depth of the issue? Yale psychologists Leonid Rosenblit and Frank Kiel conducted several series of experiments
 uske baad in donon ne har mudde par bolne ke liye utaavle in kathith budhimaanon kii jamaat ke is ravaie ko ''ilugen of explenetry depth'' kaa naam diya
 Meaning that such a person has the illusion of having deep knowledge on the related issue
 khayr, ishwar inhen maaf karnaa kyonki kathith budhimaanon kii is jamaat main shaamil insaan yah nahin jaanata ki sochane samajhane kii bhi koi seemaa hoti he
 Now the danger is that if such things are inside the boundary walls then they are limited to the hearings
 lekin jaisaa kii pash ne kaha tha, sabase khatarnaak hota he, sapanom kaa mar janaa
 But today if there was a loop, it would have been said, brother, it is even more dangerous, such a water scarcity spills into the corridors of tea bases, universities' canteens and media offices
 khaastaur par patrkaar is matibhram ke pher main kuch yun ulajhate hai ki hansi ke paatr ban jate hai
 And sometimes, the rumors spread become lively horns
 is matibhram kaa shikaar daaen or baayen donon galiyare main khadey log hai
 After deep research on the mentality of some such people, a research paper titled "political Extremeism is Supported by an Illusion of Understanding" was published in the famous SEZ publication
 prayog ke dauraan ek yojana par ativaadee raay rakhane vaale logon se tathyaparak dhang se subooton ke saath ise samajhane ke liye kaha gaya to log buniyadi tathy bhi nahin bataa paae
 Again, these people were asked to give their opinion about this scheme, they gave opinion on this with a slightly less extreme attitude than before
 jitani baar is prakriya ko kiya gaya raay kuch kam ativaadee hoti gai
 After all, after landing in the jangled jungle of facts, he realized that it is not just a matter of everyone to understand and discover the facts
 isliye behatar hoga ki ativaadee ravaie kii jagah santulit raay hi rakhi jaae
 Such debates have a major contribution in political polarization
 darasal aam or kuch khaas peshey se jude logon kii budhimaan dikhne or us jamaat kaa hissaa banane kii chahat siyasat ke khilaadiyon kaa hathiyaar banati he
 The good thing is that such hallucinatory discussions only form the basis of victory and defeat in elections
 shodhakartaaon ne bataaya ki buddhijiviyon kii jamaat se dhikkare jane kaa dar or atiaatmavishvaas milakar ativaadee soch ko janm detaa he
 This illusion can be avoided by having this superficial confidence and a sense of humility in the debate
 to thodaa ruken or sochen kahin ham is matibhram kaa shikaar to nahin
 Because if there were a loop today, they might have changed the lines of their own poem in such a way, it is dangerous that the spread of extremist political thinking on the basis of illusion is spread far and wide
 or usase bhi khatarnaak hota he, is soch kaa siyaasi hathiyaar ban janaa

 Apart from this, there is a need to remove the bottlenecks in the power and coal sectors so that industrial production can be brought back on track

 These days, International Film Festival is celebrated in Goa
 mandavi ke kinare kala academy or or puraane medical college ke peeche inox theatre main gahamagahami hoti he
 People take a walk between the movies and take a walk on the banks of Bagh Mandvi
 zyada utsaahi log dudhsagar jalprapaat bhi ghoomane jate hai
 On the Dudhsagar waterfall, the Mandvi river stops a little and continues
 dudhsagar yani doodh kaa sagar
 There is also an interesting anecdote behind this name
 bahut pehle, pashchimi ghat ke bich ek jhil hua karti thi jahaan ek rajkumaari apni sakhiyon ke saath roj snaan karne aati thi
 After bathing, the princess drank a pot of milk
 ek din vah jhil main athkheliyaan kar hi rahi thi, ki vahaan se jate ek navayuvak kii un par najar pad gai or vah noujvaan vahiin rukkar nahaati hui rajkumaari ko dekhne lag gaya
 To keep her shame, the princess's sisters poured milk pot into the lake so that they could hide themselves behind the layer of milk
 kaha jaataa he ki tabhi se is jalprapaat kaa dudhia jal anwarat bah rahaa he
 But now this milky water has started catching red color
 louh ayask ne mandavi ko zanjeeron main baandhna shuru kar diya he
 The red color of iron ore has started turning Mandvi water into a bad red color
 mandavi nadi jise mandovi, mahadaayi yaa mahadei yaa kuch jagahon par gomti nadi bhi kehete hai, mul rup se karnataka or goa main bahati he
 The Goanwale is also called the lifeline of Goa
 mandavi or juaari, goa kii do pramukh nadiyaan hai
 Mandvi river cannot be said to be very impressive in terms of length
 jis nadi kii kul lambaai hi 77 kilometre ho or jisamen se 29 kilometre kaa hissaa karnataka or 52 kilometre goa se hokar bahata ho, aap uttar bharat kii nadiyon se tulana karen to yah lambaai kuch khaas nahin he
 But in terms of trade and shipping, it is one of the most important rivers in the country and it has its strengths as well as weaknesses
 is nadi kaa udgam pashchimi ghat ke tees soton ke ek samooh se hota he jo karnataka ke belgaum jile ke bhimgarh main he
 The catchment area of the river is 2,032 km किमी in Karnataka and 1,580 km किमी in Goa
 dudhsagar prapaat or vajrapoha prapaat, mandavi ke hi bhaag hai
 Iron ore is the most important mineral in Goa and also accounts for a large share of the state's revenue
 lekin louh ayask ke gaad ne rajya kii donon pramukh nadiyon kii saans phula di he
 a recent study on Goa's rivers says that both rivers are becoming shallow by the day due to silt of iron ore
 or iskaa asar nadiyon kii tali main rahane vaale jaleey jivan par padane laga he
 a study by Goa's Department of Oceanography has revealed that the state's bicholim is highly polluted due to iron and manganese ores, while the Mandvi river's pollutants are basically iron and lead (lead)
 bicholim uttari goa jile main bahati he or mandavi kii sahaayak nadi he
 This study has raised concerns that the Zuari River and its estuaries (estuaries) flowing in the South Goa district will also be affected by metallic pollution
 goa main khanij udyog kariban paanch dashak purana he or 2018 main march main us par roak lag gai thi jab supreme court ne 88 louh ayask khadaanon ke patton kaa naveekaran khaarij kar diya tha
 Researchers from the University of Goa, Cynthia Gonkar and Vishnu Matta have studied the impact of mining on Goa's rivers and its ecosystems, and the metallic pollution on the Zuari River estuary (where the river joins the sea)
 yah adhyayan research jaranal invayrnment and arth sciensej main chapa he or isamen kaha gaya he ki uttari goa main raftaar se hue khanan kii vajah se pradooshan badha he
 In this, samples were taken from three rivers of Goa, Bicholim, Mandvi and Terekhol
 adhyayan ke mutabik, bicholim nadi main louh or maiganej ke saath sise or chromium kaa bhi pradooshan bade paimaane par moujdu he
 Of these, lead and chromium are considered heavy metals and their effects lead to cancer
 jabaki mandavi nadi main maiganej or sise kaa pradooshan he
 The Terekhol River (which until recently was completely free of pollution) contains huge quantities of metals such as copper and chromium (it is also dangerous)
 gauratlab he ki in nadiyon main bade paimaane par jahaajon ke jariye ayskon kaa parivahan kiya jaataa he or isse ayask nadi main girte rahete hai
 The debris of ores also dissolves in the rain from open quarries and comes into the rivers
 isse nadiyon kii tali main gaad jamaa hone gai he or isane tali ke paas rahane vaale yaa tali main rahane vaale jaleey jeevon kaa baari nuksaan kiya he
 According to the study, trace metals (micronutrients) in the waters of the Zuari River have been significantly lower during mining restrictions than during mining days
 isse saaf he ki yah pradooshan khanan kii vajah se hi ho rahaa he
 The people of Goa have risen on Mandvi
 sarkaar bhi sakriy hui he or rashtriya harith praadhikaran ne bhi aadesh de diya he
 Efforts should be made that the water of Mandvi should not get clogged in silt and the water of Dudhsagar falls should be milky, it should not turn red

 The battle for rights in the capital Delhi does not seem to end even after the Supreme Court's decision
 supreme court ne bhale hi apane faisle main arvind kejariwal sarkaar ko takat di ho lekin abhi bhi transfar posting ko lekar maamla fansaa he
 Now on this, the central government says that the Delhi government still does not have the right to do transfer posting
 centre sarkaar ke sutron kii maane to supreme court ne apane faisle main ek baar phir artical 239 ko bal diya he
 The Center says that things are still different about the Union Territory
 centre kaa kahana he ki supreme court ne apane faisle main saaf kaha he ki teen mudde (police, lau and order, jameen) uparajyapal ke paas hi rahenge, jabaki anya maamalon main alji ko dilli sarkaar kii salaah par kaam karnaa hoga vahiin kahin pech fansata he to vah maamla raashtrapati ko bhej sakate hai
 At the same time, apart from these three cases, no other powers have the power of transfer posting
 centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki purna rajya kii sarkaron ke paas unka khud kaa cader hota he lekin dilli ke saath aisa nahin he
 For example, Uttar Pradesh has its own cadre, so the CM can transfer there
 lekin dilli ke paas apana cader nahin he, sabhi centre shasit pradeshon kaa ek hi cader he
 Therefore, Delhi government cannot claim this right
 agar aisa hota he to dilli sarkaar kaise tay kar sakati he ki koun adhikari kahaan par jayega
 The services department returned Sisodia's file The Supreme Court gave a verdict on the rights between the Delhi government and the LG, but within a few hours of the decision, the rights resumed

 isaki shuruyaat der raat us vakt hui jab dilli ke naukarshah ke ek varisht afasar ne up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke aadesh par taka sa jawaab dete hue use maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 What is the decision of the Supreme Court? Amid a long-running war between the Aam Aadmi Party government and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, the Supreme Court has given a historic verdict
 supreme court ne kaha he ki uparajyapal dilli main faisla lene ke liye swatantra nahin hai, alji ko cabinet kii salaah ke anusaar hi kaam karnaa hoga
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is not possible for Delhi to get full statehood
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf he ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar hi rajya ko chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 After the decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also tweeted and expressed happiness, he has said that democracy has won in Delhi
 aam aadmi party lagaataar aarope lagaati rahi he ki centre kii modi sarkaar alji ke jariye apana agenda aage badha rahi he or rajya sarkaar ko kaam nahin karne de rahi he
