 On the violence against the citizenship law in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow and Sambhal, the state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday that those who have damaged public properties will be recovered from those miscreants

 Let thousands of people, including students, protest against the amended citizenship law (CAA) in several cities of the country in violation of prohibitory orders on Thursday

 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ke khilaaf vipaksh mahabhiyog prastaav laayaa he
 Opposition parties led by the Congress have submitted the proposal to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu
 ye prastaav justise loya cese main aae faisle ke baad laayaa gaya he
 On Friday, a meeting of opposition parties led by Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad took place
 iske baad congress ke samet 7 vipakshi dalon ke netaa uparashtrapati ko prastaav saunpane pahunche
 However, the process of impeachment is quite lengthy and complex
 is liye prastaav ko lekar congress main bhi ek mat nahin dikh rahaa
 You also understand what is impeachment and its entire process
 kya he mahabhiyog?mahabhiyog (impeachment) kaa istemaal supreme court or hai court ke jajon ko hataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The President can also be removed through this process
 mahabhiyog prastaav tab laayaa jaataa he jab aisa lage ki in padon par baithe log samvidhan kaa ullaghann yaa durvyavhaar kar rahe hon
 If this is happening then the motion for impeachment can be brought in any House
 iskaa zikr samvidhan ke anuchhed 62, 124 (4), (5), 217 or 218 main kiya gaya he
 Impeachment process The process of impeachment motion is considered to be extremely complex
 loksabhaa main is prastaav ko laane ke liye 100 saansadon ke hastakshar chahie
 At the same time, signatures of 50 mps are required to bring it in Rajya Sabha
 agar ye sadan main pesh hota he to sadan ke adhyaksh isapar faisla lenge
 If they want, they can accept it or they can also reject it
 agar adhyaksh mahabhiyog prastaav ko sweekaar kar lete hai to teen sadasyon kii ek cameti aaropon kii jaanch karegi
 This committee consists of a judge of the Supreme Court, a Chief Justice of the High Court and one other person
 agar jaanch cameti ko aarope sahi lagate hai to hi mahabhiyog prastaav par sansad main bahes hogi
 After this, the motion needs to be passed by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament
 agar donon sadan main ye prastaav paarit ho jaataa he to ise manzuri ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bheja jayega
 Let me tell you, only the President has the right to remove any judge
 jajon par mahabhiyog ke puraane maamle1
 For the first time in May 1993, Supreme Court Judge v
 ramasvami ko mahabhiyog kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 This proposal could not be passed in the Lok Sabha
 2
 After this, the impeachment motion was brought in 2011 against Judge Soumitra Sen of Kolkata High Court
 unpar anuchit vyavhaar kaa aarope tha
 It was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, from where it was passed in the Lok Sabha after passing
 haalanki, loksabhaa main is par charchaa hone se pehle hi jaj ne istipha de diya
 3
 2011 main hi sikkim hai court ke cheef justise pidi dinakaran ke khilaaf bhi mahabhiyog laane kaa taiyaari kii gai
 But Justice Dinakaran resigned from his post earlier
 4
 In 2015, preparations were made to bring impeachment against Gujarat High Court Justice JB Pardiwala
 unpar anuchit tippanee karne ke aarope tha
 However, he withdrew his comment even before the impeachment
 5
 In 2015, preparations were also made to impeach MP Justice SK Gangel of Madhya Pradesh High Court
 lekin unpar lage aarope sabit nahin ho sake
 6
 2016 main andhra pradesh / telugana hai court ke justise sivi nagarjun reddy ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kaa prastaav laane kii koshish kii gai
 But it did not get the necessary support
 iske baad 2017 main bhi justise sivi nagarjun reddy ke khilaaf mahabhiyog laane kaa prayaas hua, lekin is baar bhi jaruri samarthan na hone kii vajah se ye prastaav na aa sakaa
 No judge has not been removed from impeachment till date, in this way you can say that till date no judge has been removed by bringing impeachment
 kyonki ye prakiya itani jatil he ki kabhi kaarywahi puri hi nahin ho saki

 The Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) has also urged the Election Commission to hold the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha elections
 party ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki yah hairaan karne vaali baat he ki jammu evam kashmir main loksabhaa chunaav karaane ke liye suraksha sthiti sahi he lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sahi nahin he
 CPI (M) pointed out that the Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had assured the people of the state that elections to the state assembly would be held simultaneously
 saath hi party ne kaha ki chunaav ayog ko maamle main gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa chahie or ek saath vidhansabha chunaav kii ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 President's rule is currently in force in Jammu and Kashmir as the BJP withdrew support from the PDP-BJP alliance in 2018, following which the Assembly was dissolved
 bataa den ki may main shashan kii 6 maheene kii avadhi samaapt ho jaaegi
 It was believed that Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections were expected to be held simultaneously here
 par chunaav ayog ne suraksha ke lihaaj se vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon ko taal diya he
 After which all non-bjp parties are demanding to hold the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together

 He has said that this is the first time since 1996 when there will be no assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir
 chunaav ayog ne to saaf kar diya he ki loksabhaa ke chunaav 11 april se lekar 19 may tak honge
 In which elections will be held in seven phases

 Since the statement of former French President François Hollande regarding the Rafael Deal, the BJP has made serious allegations against the attacker Congress President Ahul Gandhi
 maamle ko lekar palatwaar karte hue bijepi netaa or kendriya kanoon mantriravishankar prasadne kaha ki rahul gandhi rafel kii sabhi jaankariyon ko saarvajanik karwakarpakistanki madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Prasad said, 'rahul Gandhi has called Prime Minister Modi a thief, a popular leader of the country and a symbol of honesty
 aaazaad bharat main aaj tak kisi party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne aise shabdon kaa prayog kisi pradhanmantri ke liye nahin kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi has become Congress President without any merit and ability only because he comes from Gandhi family
 lihaaja unase koi or ummid kii bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Reversing Rahul Gandhi, Ravishankar Prasad said, "the person who is out on the vine with his mother in the loot of corruption, land and shares, who is silent on robbing the land by his brother-in-law and whose entire family has taken bribe in Bofors, No one can expect a country from him
 congress party bhrashtachar kii janani he
 Targeting the Congress president, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'they are saying that tell the price of Rafael, so that the enemy becomes alert
 wo rafel kii sabhi jaankaree saarvajanik karwaakar pakistan kii madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Rahul Gandhi is playing in the hands of India's enemies by insisting on making information about all weapon systems public
 bataa den kirafel dilko lekar france ke purv raashtrapati ke bayaan ke baad se rahul gandhi kaa hamalaa tej ho gaya he
 On Saturday, he again targeted the Modi government and Reliance Company owner Anil Ambani directly
 unhone kaha ki inhone bhartiya shaheedon kaa apmaan kiya he
 Targeting PM Modi and Anil Ambani, Rahul Gandhi said, "A former French President said that he had no role in choosing Anil Ambani's company
 anil ambani ko jo hajaaron karodon kaa qaraar mila, wo narendra modi ke kehane par diya gaya tha matlab france ke ek purv raashtrapati bharat ke pradhanmantri ko chor kah rahe hai
 The Prime Minister of India should give clarification on this
 'rahul ne kaha, 'mujhako samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir hindustan ke pradhanmantrirafel dealpar ek bhi shabd kyon nahin bol rahe hai? wo oland ke bayaan par kab jawaab denge? narendra modi ne khud anil ambani ko 130 hajaar karod rupee kaa gift diya he
 Ambani has been withdrawn from the pocket of the people of the country
 ' unhone kaha ki jabapiem modirafel deal kar rahe the, tab rakshaamantri goa main machhlee kharid rahe the
 Rahul Gandhi said that PM Modi has got Anil Ambani a contract
 slamdog milenier ke sitare apane ghar waapas aa gaye hai

 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Devendra Sehrawat has once again attacked Arvind Kejriwal with a letter bomb
 guuruuvaar ko hai court ne dilli sarkaar ke 21 sansadeey sachiv kii niyukti ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Taking advantage of this, Sehrawat wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and questioned many decisions of the government
 bijwasan vidhansabha se vidhayakadavendra saharaavatane mukhyamantri kejariwal ko chitthee ke jariye tikhaa hamalaa karte hue likhaa he ki 21 vidhayakon ko aapane sansadeey sachiv niyukt kiya tha, jabaki aapako supreme court ne sonia gandhi or jaya bachchan kii niyukti ke laabh ke pad ke daayre main tehraate hue avaidh bataaya tha
 After which both had to resign from their posts
 ye sab jaanate hue aapane ashish talwaar or baaki salaahkaaron, jinhen koi gyaan nahin kii baat maani
 The situation is that the sword of going out of the membership of 12 mlas is hanging on the head
 lekin puri jimmedaari aapke upar he
 Because the legislators won the election by putting in hard work
 apni chitthee main devendra saharaavat ne ashish khetaan kii adhyakshata vaale dilli samvaad ayog par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 The MLA alleged that there was no need to create a Delhi Dialogue Commission, as it is like a white elephant
 isaki karypranali kya he, gathan kis makasad se hua ye samaj se baahar he
 The people of Delhi have chosen us from the democratic system and we are familiar with the problems in our areas
 isliye hamaari salaah se vikaas kii yojanaayen banani chahie
 The Delhi Dialogue Commission should be discontinued, as the Commission has had a dubious role in the recent proposal for shuttle bus service
 devendra saharaavat ne aarope lagaaya ki cabinet main dilli samvaad ayog kaa prastaav niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hue rakhaa gaya taaki ye sandesh mil sake ki dallali karne ke liye ashish khetaan upyukt vyakti he
 This commission has now come to be known as Delhi Dalal Commission
 vidhayak ne apni chitthee se salaahkaaron kii niyukti par sawaal uthaae or aarope lagaate hue mukhyamantri ko likhaa ki 4 sitambar ko patr ke madhyam se avgat karaayaa tha ki aapke chaaron taraf mitra mandali ashish talwaar, vaibhav, or ashvith motaa vetan paa rahe hai
 Whereas they have nothing to do with constitutional functions
 aapako anek patron main likh chukaa hum ki bhrasht adhikariyon ke tabadale main bhrashtachar, parivahan vibhaag main bhrashtachar, aapke vyaktigat staff kii vasuuli karne kaa ravaiya he, lekin aapkaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 Finally, Devendra Sehrawat also asked for the controversial letter, and wrote tightly that i have raised the issue of female exploitation this time, to which you have not given any response yet
 gauratlab he ki aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh devendra saharaavat ke upar manahani kaa mukadmaa darj kara chuke hai
 But it does not seem to have any effect on the MLA
 purv vittamantri or bijepi saansad yashavanth sinha ne guuruuvaar ko pesh aam bajet ko 'baazeegari kaa bajet' qaraar dete hue kaha ki vittamantri pi chidambaram ne jo bajet pesh kiya he, usase lagata he ki bhavishya main aarthik sankat or gahrayega
 Yashwant Sinha told reporters in the Parliament complex that amidst the challenges of fiscal deficit, inflation etc
, his figures have been juggled
 unhone kaha ki vittamantri ne rajkoshiya ghate ko 5
 2 per cent, while the Kelkar Committee took it to 5
 3 fisadi rakhane kii sifarish kii thi
 Fiscal deficit next year4
 8 fisadi par rakhane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Let's see how far this stays true
 purv vittamantri ne kaha ki desh main buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh ke liye dhan kii kami nahin, balki pariyojnaon ko manjuuri, bhoomi adhigrahan, paryaavaran manzooriyon kii samasyaayein rahati hai, jis par chidambaram ne kuch nahin kaha
 He did not say anything on the ambitious river link project proposed by the NDA government, which could have boosted the economy
 sinha ne kaha ki vittamantri ne videshi nivesh par bade jor dekar apni baat kahi jaise videshi nivesh se hi sari dikkatein dur ho jaaengi or desh apane dam par nahin, balki videshi madad se aarthik vikaas karegaa
 This is the formula of UPA
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar khaadya suraksha vidheyak ko isi satr main laane kaa daawa kar rahi he, jiske liye bajet main 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa aavanton prastaavit he, jabaki visheshgy is kanoon ke lagu hone ke baad arthvyavastha par ek lakh karod rupee ke bhaar kaa anumaan laga rahe hai
 According to Sinha, the biggest disappointment was that even after the report of the Direct Taxes Code Bill was given by the Standing Committee on March 9 last year, it did not materialize
 acha hota ki chidambaram nayaa iskar kanoon laate, lekin unhone asthaayee badlaav hi kiye hai
 The comments bijepi netaa ne haalanki awaas par iskar main ek lakh rupee kii atirikt kar chhot kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki kareeb ek dashak baad awaas kshetra main is tarah kii raahat di gai he
 Earlier the NDA government took 1 on this
 5 lakh rupee kii chhot di thi
 Sinha said that Chidambaram did nothing special in excise
 alag-alag utpaadon par ghatat-badhat karne kii bajaay isamen ekarupata lani chahie thi
 There is also no roadmap for Goods and Services Charge (GST) in this budget
 haalanki kendriya bikri shulk (siasti) main rajyon ko muaavje ke taur par 9,000 karod rupee ke aavanton ke prastaav kaa swaagat karte hue bijepi saansad ne kaha ki ham isaki maang karte rahe hai
 He said that it is clear from the budget that an additional tax burden of about Rs 18,000 crore will be passed on to the people, with an additional burden of Rs 13,000 crore on direct tax and Rs 4,700 crore on indirect tax
 iskaa sidhaa asar mahangaai par padegaa
 Sinha said that there is a huge investment crisis before the country and there are no hopeful suggestions in this budget to revive it
 isse niveshkon kaa utsaah nahin badhegaa
 Confidence will remain lacking
 yashavanth sinha ne sansad parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki rajkoshiya ghaataa, mudrasphiti aadi kii chunautiyon ke bich inke aankadon main baazeegari kii gai he
 He said that the Finance Minister has reduced the fiscal deficit to 5
 2 fisadi par rakhane kaa shrey liya he, jabaki kelkar samiti ne ise 5
 It was recommended to keep 3 percent
 rajkoshiya ghaataa agle saal 4
 Aimed to keep it at 8 per cent
 dekhte hai yah kahaan tak sahi rahata he
 The former finance minister said that there is no shortage of funds to invest in infrastructure in the country, but there are problems of approvals, land acquisition, environmental clearances, to which Chidambaram did not say anything
 unhone endie sarkaar dwaara prastaavit mahatvakankshi nadi jodo pariyojna par kuch nahin kaha, jisase arthvyavastha ko gati mil sakati thi
 Sinha said that the Finance Minister spoke with great emphasis on foreign investment as if all the problems will be overcome with foreign investment and the country will develop economic development with foreign help, not on its own
 yahi upie kaa formula he
 He said that the government is claiming to bring the Food Security Bill in this session, for which an allocation of Rs
10 thousand crore is proposed in the budget, while experts estimate the burden of one lakh crore rupees on the economy after the implementation of this law
 Are applying sinha ke mutabik sabase zyada niraashaa is baat se hui ki pratyaksh kar samhita vidheyak ke sambandh main sthaayee samiti dwaara pichley saal 9 march ko hi report die jane ke baad bhi is par koi amal nahin hua
 It would have been nice if Chidambaram had introduced a new income tax law, but he has made only temporary changes
 tippaniyan The BJP leader, however, welcomed the additional tax exemption of Rs 1 lakh in income tax on housing, saying that such relief has been given in the housing sector after nearly a decade
 isse pehle endie sarkaar ne is par 1
 5 lakh was given off
 sinha ne kaha ki chidambaram ne utpaada shulk main kuch khaas nahin kiya
 Instead of moving around different products, it should have brought uniformity
 is bajet main vastu evam seva shulk (jiesti) ke liye bhi koi rodmap nahin he
 However, welcoming the proposal of allocation of Rs 9,000 crore as compensation to the states in the Central Sales Charge (CST), the BJP MP said that we have been demanding it
 unhone kaha ki bajet se spasht he ki kareeb 18 hajaar karod rupee kaa atirikt kar bhaar logon par padegaa, jisamen pratyaksh kar par 13,000 karod rupee or apratyaksh kar par 4,700 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj rahegaa
 This will directly affect inflation
 sinha ne kaha ki desh ke saamne nivesh kaa bada sankat he or isamen jaan daalane ke liye koi ummid vaala suzav is bajet main nahin hai
 This will not increase investor enthusiasm
 vishwaas main kami bani rahegi

 Anna Hazare is coming to Delhi once again, but this time the reason is not about the movement, but his health
 anna hajaare or dilli ke bich gajab ke rishte ko saal 2011 main puri duniya ne dekha
 Anna Hazare also forced the government in power in the country to kneel several times last year in Delhi itself
 bhrashtachar or bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf majboot lokapal bill ke liye april 2011 main dilli se anna hajaare ne apane andolan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Anna Hazare is coming again to the same Delhi from where he had raised the agitation of the movement to get his campaign and destination last year, but this time the reason and purpose is something else
 anna hajaare ravivaar dopaher dilli pahunchane vaale hai
 They will reach Pune in the day from their village Ralegan Siddhi
 phir pune se ve dilli ke liye udaan bharenge or dopaher dilli pahunchenge
 This time, Anna Hazare will stay in Delhi for only two days
 darasal, agast 2011 main 13 dinon tak ann ko tyaagane vaale anna kii tabiyat abhi bhi thik nahin he
 Anna is not yet 100% fit and her illness is still troubling her
 jaankaree ke mutabik apni usee bigadi hui sehat ke ilaaj ke liye anna dilli aa rahe hai
 Anna Hazare has reached the age of 74 and it is a matter of concern that his health is not fully recovered
 mumbai ke mrdie maidan main 27 disambar 2011 ko apane saal ke tisare anshan se pehle hi anna kii tabiyat kharaab ho chuki thi or uske baad abtak anna puri tarah se tandoorust nahin ho paaen hai
 The question arises that why Anna Hazare, who has been undergoing treatment for the last several days, is not recovering? Why medicines are not being effected properly on Anna? Is Anna suffering from a serious illness or not? Or is the reaction of Anna to English medicines? Hopefully, only after coming to Delhi, the truth of Anna Hazare's disease will be revealed

 The Election Commission has said in its order that it prohibits the showing of any political content shown on Namo TV
 ayog ne kaha ki yah channel bijepi chalaa rahi he
 Also said that the content running on this TV (namo TV) was not pre-certified
 isapar maujuud contate puri tarah se raajnneetik he, jo aachaar samhitake daayre main aata he
 While giving instructions, the Election Commission said that permission should be taken first for any content running on this TV
 bataa den ki chunaav ke kuch din pehle se tamaam dish tivi par namo tivi (namo TV) ko prasaarit kiya ja rahaa tha
 On this TV, rallies and speeches of PM Narendra Modi were broadcast round the clock
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ko piem modi ke byopic or namo tivi ko lekar ek duvidha kii sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 Initially it was felt that the Election Commission has issued orders for both
 haalanki baad main chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ne buudhvaar ko spasht kiya tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi par aadhaarit film ke pradarshan par roak lagane vaale ayog ke aadesh kaa namo tivi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 But hours before this, officials had said that the commission's decision on the film also applies to the channel
 adhikariyon ne kaha tha ki byopic par die gaye aadesh ko unhone 'galat samaj' liya or iskaa namo tivi se koi sambandh nahin he
 He had earlier said that the order given on the film would also apply to Namo TV, whose telecast cannot be allowed during elections
 adhikariyon ne us vakt aadesh ke ek paragraph kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha tha, 'pehle se pramanit kisi bhi prachaar saamagree se jude poster yaa prachaar kaa koi bhi madhyam, jo kisi ummidavaar ke bare main chunavi aayam kaa pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se chithran karata ho, chunaav aachaar samhita ke dauraan electronic media main istemaal nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 He later said that some clarification was sought from the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer regarding the pre-certification of political advertising on Namo TV
 is spashtikaran par chunaav ayog ab gaur kar rahaa he
 The Commission stopped the performance of Modi's biopic, saying that a film which serves the purpose of serving the electoral interests of any political party or politician cannot be screened in electronic media
 bataa den ki dit seva muhaiyaa karaane vaale tata ski ne haal hi main kaha tha ki namo tivi(namo TV ) ek hindi news sarvice he, jo rashtriya raajnneeti par tazatreen braking news muhaiyaa karaati he
 This service provider's tweet raised questions on the central government's claim
 ek prakaar se tata ski ne twit kar sarkaar ke us daawey kaa khandan kiya tha, jisamen namo tivi ko mahaj ek vigyaapan plateform bataakar pallaa jhaad liya gaya tha
 This channel, named Namo TV, launched suddenly on 31 March, since then it is also being promoted continuously by the Twitter handle of the ruling BJP
 khud piem modi bhi chaukidaaron ko sambodhit karne se jude program kaa is tivi par prasaaran hone kii 31 march ko soochna de chuke hai
 Earlier today, the Election Commission had banned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biopic film 'PM Narendra Modi' till the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ayog ne kaha tha ki jab tak loksabhaa chunaav khatm nahin ho jate, tab tak is film par roak lagi rahegi
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had on Tuesday rejected the petition seeking a stay on the release of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biopic 'PM Narendra Modi'
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki yachikakarta kii chintaa kaa hal karne ke liye uchit sanstha nirvachan ayog he, kyonki yah ek sanvaidhanik nikaay he
 Subsequently, the team of the film 'PM Narendra Modi' on Tuesday thanked the judiciary for the Supreme Court's dismissal of the petition seeking a stay on the release of the film
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki yachikakarta kii chintaa kaa hal karne ke liye uchit sanstha nirvachan ayog he jo ki ek sanvaidhanik nikaay he
 The Election Commission should decide whether the release of the film in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections (lok Sabha Election 2019) does not create any special political party advantage or inclination for it during the election

 Prior to the Reserve Bank's mid-quarter review on December 18, RBI Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on Saturday that inflation would remain a primary concern for the central bank

 'change is not necessary with just one initiative
 
 There are many risks associated with this

 duusari timahi kii maudrik samiksha ke dauraan bhi rigerv bank ne nitigat daron ko yathaavat rakhaa

 During his visit, Kejriwal will meet the families of Patel youths who died during the Patidar Reservation Movement in Mehsana, Ahmedabad and Surat last year

 The Aam Aadmi Party alleges that it has been installed by the BJP which shows the anger of the BJP and this is happening in all the programs of AAP
 gujarat ke 'aap' prabharee gulab singh yadav kaa aarope he ki bhartiya janata party ke padaadhikari, kaaryakartaaon ne 9 taarikh ko unki bike raily ke dauraan bhi arvind kejariwal ke postaron par kaalikh potkar bhaag gayi the
 And when his profile was checked, it was found that he was close to Amit Shah and many ministers
 wo is poster waar ko bhaajapa kii baukhalaahat bataa rahe hai or aarope he ki ye poster bhaajapa hi laga rahi he
 On the other hand, apart from Surgical Strike, BJP is preparing to declare AAP as anti-narmada and Gujarat by calling them anti-narmada Dam because of Aam Aadmi Party's policy towards Narmada Dam
 lekin unka kahana he ki ye poster bhaajapa ne nahin lagavaaye
 BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya says, 'it is not the BJP, it is getting the people of Gujarat and the public is angry because it is a border state and you will insult the soldiers about the surgical strike in Pakistan and you will find your social media in Pakistan People of Gujarat cannot bear if they try to be such a hero trend

 It is considered a big step in view of the upcoming assembly elections
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main mathon or voton kaa majboot naata he
 The coordination meeting of the ASS in Bangalore on March 3 was seriously affected
 magar jaise hi kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar ne yah sandesh diya ki mathon main bhaajapa netaaon ke pahunchane ke liye rajamandi party adhyaksh amit shah ne hasil kar lee he, tane hue chehron par kuch sukun kaa bhav dikhne laga
 This gives an idea of the importance of the Karnataka monasteries, but it also shows how desperately the BJP needs with the monasteries
 haalanki yah rajamandi bhi aasaani se hasil nahin kii ja saki he
 That incident is also interesting
 pichley saal july ke antim saptaah main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah karnataka daure kaa kaarykram tay kar chuke the
 But before that, he wanted time to meet Swami Nirmalananda of Adi Chunchanagiri, the most prominent monastery of Vokkaligga community
 pataa chalaa ki swami desh se baahar hai
 After all, Shah himself called Nirmalanand by phone and took an appointment on 12 August
 is tarah unhen apana daura do hafte tak taalna padaa
 Shah was not so eager to meet the lord of the Chunchangiri Math
 bhaajapa ke 'chanakya', shah is baat se waakif hai ki karnataka main satta mathon se hokar guzarati he
 Then former Prime Minister H
K
, a prominent leader of the Vokkaligga community
 di
 Deve Gowda is considered and his party Janata Dal (secular) is considered to have a great influence on the Chunchangiri Math
 so, amit shah or bhaajapa kii koshish is baar math kaa aashirwad paane kii he, taaki vokkaligga samudaay main paith banaai ja sake
 Well, on August 12, Amit Shah's meeting with Nirmalananda lasted for more than 5 hours
 haalanki nirmalanand kehete hai, ''itani lambii mulaakaat main siyasat kii koi baat nahin hui
 Yes, talks about the state of the state and the country did happen, but neither the BJP president sought any support, nor did the monastery support or oppose anyone politically
 ''haalanki math ke sutron kaa kahana he ki amit shah nirmalanand ko is baat ke liye raji kar gaye ki unka aashirwad lene bhaajapa ke duusare bade netaa or centre sarkaar ke mantri math aate rahenge
 After this long meeting, there was a discussion in the state that the Swami of Vokkaligga Math is inclined towards BJP
 ve bhaajapa ke samarthan kii baat bhale na karen magar virodh to nahin hi karenge
 After that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar also met Nirmalanand
 amit shah ke daure ke baad anant kumaar, sadanand gauda jaise kendriya mantri bhi aadi chunachangiri math kaa daura kar chuke hai
 According to information received from the monastery, there is a long list of Union ministers and senior BJP leaders seeking an appointment with Swami Nirmalanand
 philhal unhen samay nahin diya gaya he, kyonki swamiji kaa aadesh he ki rajnatik kaarykram ke dauraan karnataka aane vaale kisi bhi dal ke netaa se ve milanaa nahin chaahate
 Actually, monasteries in Karnataka are not just centers of spiritual and cultural activities, they are in the role of a very important 'social institution'
 garib bacchon ke laalan-paalan se lekar, shiksha-diksha tak kii vyavastha math kii ore se hoti he
 Their doors are open to people of all religions and castes
 is lihaaj se yahaan ke math kisi sarkari sanstha kii tarah kaam karte hai
 The issues which can be part of the manifesto of any political party, they have been doing all the work for a hundred years
 garibon ko bhojan, bacchon ko shiksha, garib ghar kii ladakiyon kii shaadi, ejineering or medical college tathaa anya shikshan santhaan sab kuch mathon ke tahat chalata he
 Hence, according to experts, the state's large population (up to 85 per cent according to some people) is directly or indirectly associated with some monastery
 rajya ke sabhi 30 jilon main mathon kaa jaal failaa hua he
 The monastery has its own dominance and dominance in terms of caste equation which attracts political parties towards them
 rajya main sabase adhik dabadabe vaale lingayat samudaay kii sankhya 18 fisadi he
 The main monastery of this community is Siddaganga at Tumkur, about 80 km from Bangalore
 is math ko bhaajapa samarthak mana jaataa he
 Its chief Shivkumar Swami has been 110 years old and is ill
 math kaa sara kaam ab siddhalinga swami dekhte hai
 They say, our state has more than 400 monasteries
 math kisi rajnatik dal kaa na to virodh karata he, na hi samarthan
 We work diligently with social concerns and we are supported by all
 '' na math kisi rajnatik dal kaa samarthan nahin karata he to phir siddhaganga math ko bhaajapa kaa samarthak kyon kaha jaataa he?siddhalinga swami kaa jawaab he, ''shaayad bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar bi
 s
 yediurppa ke lingayat samudaay se hone kii vajah se aisa he
 But our monastery also attracts leaders from other parties and other communities
 ham rajnatik rup se nirpeksh hai
 Vokkaligga is the second dominant caste of Karnataka in terms of population
 isaki aabaadi 12 fisadi he
 The major monastery of this community is Adi Chunchangiri
 ise janata dal (secular) samarthak math mana jaataa he
 HD Deve Gowda is considered the greatest leader of the Vokkaligga community
 math kaa prabhaav dakshin karnataka main apekshaakrit adhik he
 It is the same area in the state where the highest number of JDS mlas wins since 1985
 rajya main vokkaligga samudaay ke 150 math hai, jinamein zyaadaatar dakshin karnataka main hai
 The monastery has dozens of educational institutions
 haalanki math main kisi bhi jati yaa dharm ke bacchon ke liye koi pratibandh nahin he lekin sabase adhik bachche vokkaligga samudaay se hi hai
 Swami Nirmalananda of the monastery denies that the monastery is a JDS supporter but the people of the monastery indirectly accept that, "the Vokkaligga community can move forward in every sphere of society, irrespective of politics, it The monastery wants it
 ''math ke pramukh swami nirmalanand kehete hai, ''math ko kisi rajnatik party kaa samarthak bataanaa thik nahin he
 If this happens then why would the leaders of BJP, Congress and other parties come
 hamase jo bhi shraddha se milanaa chahta he, sabhi ke liye hamaare daravaaje khule hai
 The third major monastery is associated with the Qurba community
 80 se adhik math is samudaay se jude hai
 The main monastery is the Srigaire monastery in Davanagere
 maujuuda mukhyamantri siddharamaiya isi samudaay se aate hai
 The Kurba population in the state is 8 percent
 iske alaava suttur math-mysuru, aasthaa math-udupi, murusvira math-hubli, kamapari math-chikmaglur vagairah pramukh hai
 People from SC-ST community are connected to these monasteries
 har rajnatik dal ke netaa in mathon kaa samarthan paane kii jugat main hai
 Siddaramaiah will give a big blow to the BJP by giving Lingayat the status of religion! This time the whole BJP is trying to practice Adi Chunchangiri Math (vokkaligga) because Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has made his entry in Tumkur Math, considered a BJP supporter
 mukhyamantri ne lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kii pahal shuru kar di he
 Due to this, the inclination of Lingayat community or at least the monastery seems to be towards Siddaramaiah
 siddhalinga swami kehete hai, ''mujhe pataa he ki mukhyamantri ne lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kii baat kii he
 If this happens, certainly the constitutional and legal benefits that people of minority religion get will also be given to the Lingayat community
 math samudaay ke kalyaan ke liye hi kaam kar rahaa he, koi isamen madad karata he to uskaa dhanyavad
 "in fact, Siddaramaiah has tried to shock the BJP with this sigope
 bhaajapa is mudde par kuch bhi kehane kii sthiti main nahin he sivaa iske ki aisa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa says, "congress has only made political statements
 mahaj lingayat hi nahin anya samudaay ke logon kaa bhi bhaajapa ko samarthan he
 People are not going to get caught in the Congress conspiracy
 ''duusari ore, mukhyamantri siddharamaiya kehete hai, ''rajya main jitne bhi math hai un sab kaa samarthan congress ko he
 Why is Yeddyurappa sitting silently on the issue of granting separate religion status to Lingayats? "the lord of the monastery may claim that he is politically neutral but the reality is that Karnataka has neither politics without the monastery, nor politics Math without rajya ke muddon se lekar, pratyaashiyon ke chayan tak main math pratyaksh or paroksh rup se shaamil hai
 After getting power, there is a penetration of monasteries in the cabinet
 math ke logon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, har dal ke netaa math ke swami ko party ke har faisle kii tatkaal jaankaree dete hai
 For example, how many tickets were given to the people of which community in the ticket distribution, how many people were advocated by the Math, how many were given tickets, etc
 iske baad hi math yah faisla karata he ki kis dal ko vot dene kaa paroksh yaa pratyaksh rup se sandesh anuyaayiyon ko diya jaae
 The signs of supporting any party or candidate on behalf of the monasteries are also fun
 bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke liye bhakton ko pravachan yaa darshan dete vakt swami apane haath kii ungaliyon ko pushp aakaar main rakhte hai
 Or they are seated with a flower in their hand or throw flowers on the devotees before going after the darshan
 congress ko samarthan dena he to swami haath upar uthaakar rakhte hai

 Would you like more and more Lingayat community members to be elected as mlas and mps? This is the job of the people

 This is the story of Team India
 
 
 videshi jameen par test maichon or shrunkhalaaon main haar maano ab team india kii aadat ban chuki he
 
 
 For them, the draw is not less than the win and the win is an exception

 Anyway, India is second behind Australia in ODI rankings
 purv australian ballebaaz maaikel hasi apni team ko chetavanee dete hue kehete hai, "2-0 ke score line se aap zyaada matlab nahin nikaal sakate
 
 
 Not only did India compete hard in the Test series, but in limited overs cricket, India's team plays completely different
 
 
 unka aatmavishvaas badha hota he
 
 
 " van-de main slip hatate hi bhartiya ballebaaz bekhauf hokar shots lagaate hai, gendbaazi bhi behatar ho jaati he or fielding chust
 Former Indian cricketer Dilip Vengsarkar says, "the biggest advantage in odis is that no bowler has to bowl more than 10 overs, while in a Test, he has to bowl at least 25 overs a day
" 
 
 isliye hamaare gendbaaz van-de or tii-20 main zyaada prabhavi hote hai
 
 
 " record bhi is baat ke gavaah hai ki van-de main videshi jameen par team india kaa pradarshan test maichon se kahin behatar hota he
 Since last World Cup, Team India has played 24 Test matches on foreign pitches, out of which they have lost 15 Tests and won only two, while seven matches have been drawn

 This festival is celebrated with joy and devotion in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and India's neighboring country Nepal

 On this day, the story of Shashti Devi associated with Mahabharata is also heard, which is like this

 According to another belief, Chhath festival started in the Mahabharata period
 sabase pehle surya putr karn ne surya dev kii puja shuru kii
 Karna was the supreme devotee of Lord Surya
 vah pratidin ghanton qamar tak pani main khadey hokarsurya ko arghya detaa
 By the grace of Surya, he became a great warrior

 yahaan ke nagadi gaanv main chhathvrati naa to nadi or naa hi talab main arghya dete he balki ek sote ke paas chhath puja hoti he
 Actually it is believed that Draupadi used to worship Suryopasana near this spring and also offer arghya to Surya
 aisa mana jaataa he ki vanvaas ke dauraan pandav jharkhand ke is ilaake main kaaphi dinon tak tehre the
 It is said that once the Pandavas were thirsty and could not get water far away, then at the behest of Draupadi, Arjuna fired water by throwing arrows into the ground
 manyata yah bhi he ki isi jal ke sote ke paas draupadi surya ko arghya detii thi
 Because of the worship of the Sun, the blessings of the sun always remained on the Pandavas
 isi manyata ki vajah se aaj bhi yahaan chhath dhoomdhaam se manaai jaati he
 These stories are also prevalent here, a little distance from here is Harhi village
 manyata he ki yahaan bhim kaa sasuraal tha

 Love in a man-woman relationship does not just mean sexual intercourse
 pyaar kisi bhi premi jode ke liye anand kaa sabab ban saktaa he magar kai baar aisa nahin ho paata
 Often, after some time of marriage, sex becomes a habit in life, which most of the couples just accept the need of the body and cannot enjoy the important moments of life
 aapke saath bhi aisa kabhi hua hoga jab aap apane saathi ko apane pyaar ke ahsaas ko sahi prakaar se na dikhaa paaen ho yaa phir aapke pyaar dikhaane kaa tarika aapke saathi ko pasand na aayaa ho
 Always remember that sexual intercourse will become an important part of your life only when you keep it filled with the energy of love
 apane saathi ko pyaar dene main kabhi kami naa karen, ek-duusare kii baton ko samajhane kii koshish karen or un kaarnon ko dur karne kaa prayaas karen, taaki aap ek behatar jivan kaa anand le saken
 Keep refreshing your sex life from time to time
 tabhi aap sukhmay sex jivan ji sakate hai or apane rishte main taazgi banaae rakh sakate hai

 'he said,' As i have said earlier, it has been the tradition of the BJP that the central parliamentary board of the party makes any decision about the chief minister or the prime ministerial candidate
 ’ The BJP president's statement comes at a time when leaders like Ram Jethmalani and Yashwant Sinha have demanded Modi to be made an NDA nominee for the post of Prime Minister

 The Congress, the Communist Party of India Marxist (CPIM) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) have retaliated strongly on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on Rafale aircraft and air strikes
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke baad ab unki hi party ke netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki jab piem modi kehete hai ki agar rafel vimaan hota, to nateeja kuch or hota, to wo khud bhartiya vayusena kii air strike par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Congress leader Tiwari said that PM Modi himself is responsible for not having Rafael
 agar unhone apane karibiyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye tikadam nahin kiya hota, to rafel vimaan bharat ke paas hota
 Apart from this, CPIM leader Nilotpal Basu and CPI leader d Raja have also targeted PM Modi's remarks on Rafale aircraft
 basu ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ko rafel kii kami mahasoos ho rahi he
 Was the courage shown by the Indian Air Force in Pakistan not that good? He said that the second question is that if Rafael is so good, then why was it reduced from 5 Squadern to 2 Squadorn? No citizen of the country is in protest in the war against terrorism
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf desh ko ekajute hokar ladanaa chahie, lekin bhartiya janata party ke netaaon kaa jo bhaashan he, wo is ekajutata ko todane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 CPIM leader Basu said, 'I saw the picture that the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party is going out in the election campaign wearing military attire
 bijepi kii ek jeep ke aage wing commander abhinandan kii tasviir lagi he
 The language in which Prime Minister Modi and BS Yeddyurappa are speaking have distorted national unity against terrorism
 unhone kaha ki agar aaj koi bharat ke khilaaf he, to wo hai bhartiya janata party or pradhanmantri modi
 We are against terrorism
 ham sab iske khilaaf ekajute hona chaahate hai
 He said why BJP is playing with national unity
 iske atirikt sipiai netaa di raja ne kaha, 'main rafel par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan se sahamat nahin hum
 PM Modi should take responsibility for the Rafale deal himself
 modi pichley paanch saal se desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 What did he do with Rafael for so long
 ' raja ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi ne saarvajanik company HAL ko darkinar karke rafel deal us company ko de diya, jo mahaj 10 din pehle hi register hui thi or jise raksha kshetra kaa koi anubhav nahin tha
 With this, the price of Rafale aircraft was also increased
 di raja ne kaha ki agar rafel vimaan milane main deree ho rahi he, to iske liye pradhanmantri modi ko javabdehi hona chahie
 He asked who has stopped the Rafale deal? PM Modi himself has decided on this
 isamen na to rakshaamantri shaamil rahe or na hi videsh mantri
 Questioning the air strike, he said that the Indian media is telling the news of 200 to 300 terrorists killed in the air strike of the Air Force, while the media of other countries of the world are giving news other than this
 aapako bataa den ki shanivaar ko india today conklev ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakistan main bhartiya vayusena dwaara kii gai air strike kaa zikr kiya tha
 At the same time, while targeting the opposition parties, they said that the country has missed the Rafale
 agar rafel hota, to nateeja kuch or hota he

 In fact, from this record, the Noida Metro Rail Corporation wants to find out how many passengers will travel in the Aqua line and on the basis of this the trains will be decided
 is survey kaa ek ahm kaaran ye bhi he ki iske zarie noida metro rail corporation yah pataa karnaa chahta he ki koun se stesan par behad kam futfol rahegaa
 On that basis, it will be decided whether to stop the train at those stations at peak time
 noida metro rail korporation ke kaaryakari nideshak pidi upaadhyaay ne bataaya ki metro kaa sanchaalan shuru hone vaala he
 Earlier the trial run is going on but through a survey we want to find out which station will be more crowded and where there is no at all

 Please tell that the name of the Metro route running from Noida to Greater Noida will be Aqua Line
 is line kii duuri 29 kilometre he
 21 stations will be built on this entire route
 use jo acha lagata he wo karata he
 Whether it is against the society, against the law or against the whole of humanity
 tabhi to use duniya taanashaah kahati he
 But the dictatorship of this dictator that you have seen so far
 wo to kuch bhi nahin
 What we are telling you is going to cross all limits of cruelty
 or wo he kim jong un ke torchar room
 Where a man goes, he is alive, but returns as a corpse
 duniya kaa sabase beraham insaan!taarikh ke panne uthaakar unhen palatnaa shuru kiijie or dhundie us insaan ko jise duniya kaa sabase krur, sabase beraham or sabase bedard insaan kaha ja sake
 Surely, some names may have started coming in your mind, Adolf Hitler's name may have come in the mind of some
 jisane yatnaa camp main lakhon yahudiyon ko tadapaa tadapaa kar maar daalaa
 Some may have taunted Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 jiske maut dene ke tareeke se khud yamraj bhi panaah maangate hai
 Or some might be thinking of Saddam Hussein
 jinhone chemical atake kar hazaron logon ko ek jatke main maut kii neend sula diya
 Or some might be thinking of Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, Idi Amin Genghis Khan and Mao Zedang
 krurta kaa devtaa kim jong unamgar jab aapkim jong unke naam tak pahunch jaaen to apane zahan kii kasarat ko roak dijie
 Because now you have reached that person
 jisaki krurta kaa taarikh main na to koi sani hua
 Neither is nor probably ever will be
 aapako puraa haq he ki aap hairaan ho jaaen
 We too were, but not until we were confronted with that truth
 jise is taanashaah ne duniya ke saamne aane nahin diya
 The truth is that neither Hitler, Baghdadi, nor Saddam nor Idi Amin reach close to it in terms of ruthlessness
 torchar room main har roj marate hai logis taanashaah ke torchar room ke bare main ek peedit bataata he ki aap vahaan akele rahakar sirf maut kaa intazaar kar sakate hai
 Every night, even after the lights were extinguished, screams were heard from every room
 kyonki har raat koi na koi vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish karata tha
 And when caught, they are stripped and beaten very brutally overnight
 sabase dardanaak to ye he ki har rose vahaan log beraham maut mar rahe hai or duniya ko iskaa pataa tak nahin he
 If you have a weak heart, we will still ask you not to read and watch this report
 wo isliye ki jaise jaise aap aage badhate jaaengen
 Your faith will rise in humility
 kyonki ye kahani north korea ke aise taanashaah ki he jisane apni krurta se mulk kii jelon or yatnaa campon main sirf kaidiyon ke jismon ko hi nahin balki ruhon ko bhi zakhmi kar diya he
 And today this story will reveal the same wounds and the truth of Kim Jong Un
 ek mahila ne bataai khaufnak sacchaiek bhuktabhogi mahila bataati he ki wo duniya se kahana chaahati hum ki bhagwaan ke liye un logon ko bachaa lijie jo un torchar campon main fanse hue hai
 Because she has escaped from there
 usne wo dard jhela he
 Prisoners are locked in a cell where they can neither sit
 na let sakate hai or na khadey hi ho sakate hai
 They were like dogs' cages
 or unhen vahaan vaise hi rahanaa padataa tha
 He used to eat in it
 usee main shouch karte the
 This story is not one or two people but hundreds of people who managed to escape from North Korea's jails or torture camps
 unhone kim jong un ke zulmon sitam kii kahani bayaan kii he
 But no one other than a woman named Rot could dare to show face
 kaidiyon ko miltaa he sada hua khanajelon or campon main itnaa zulm hota he ki log bhaagane kii koshish karte hai
 And they shoot them without thinking
 or baaki candiyon ko uski laashen dikhaakar dhamkee di jaati he ki unka bhi yahi haal hoga
 In the name of food, the prisoners get a bowl of rice just once a day
 usamen bhi itnaa pani mila diya jaataa he ki wo chaaval se dalia ban jaataa he or usamen se sadan kii badboo aati he
 The Korean torture camp that is ruthless without hearing is like that person on this earth
 jahaan insaaniyat naam kii koi chiz hi nahin he
 Prisoners are made to work like machines for 18-18 hours a day
 or kaam se inkaar karnaa yahaan apnidardanaak mautko daavat dene jaisaa he
 They get what they get in the name of food and they die of weakness in a few days
 or jo nahin khate wo bhukh se mar jate hai
 The example of brutal methods used here to torture prisoners is found nowhere in the present world nor in history
 kisi bhi niyam ko todane par yahaan bina kisi sunwaayee ke ek hi sazaa milti he
 And that is death
 pehali baar duniya ke saamne ai aisi krurataye pehla mauka he jab duniya ke saamne north korea ke sanakee taanashaah kii krurta kii hakeekat saamne aa rahi he
 But the full torture of torture in Kim Jong Un's torture room is yet to be revealed
 media par pabandi lagaakar kaise ye taanashaah apane kaidiyon par kahar dhaha rahaa he
 We are telling you its inside story
 or ye insaide story kim jong un ke maut ke shivi main bataur guard tainaat rahe lim kii ankhon dekhi he
 He tells that after tying his hands back, he used to hold his hair and hit his face on the walls and table
 wo insaan nahin haivaan hai
 How can a human do this to another human being
 us jagah ke bare main bataane ke liye uske paas shabd nahin he
 There the torture starts with the sun rising and continues till the sun sets
 mahila kaidiyon ke saath balaatkaarlim ke mutabik purush sicurity guard mahila kaidiyon kaa rape karte hai
 He has witnessed the rape and murder of thousands of prisoners before his eyes
 itnaa hi nahin unhen zindaa jala diya jaataa he
 Women prisoners are forced to abort while pregnant
 wo garbhvatee mahilaon ke pet par laat maarthe hai
 Even then, if children were born, they are buried alive
 lim kahati hai ki abhi bhi ye yakeen kar paanaa mushkil he ki vah zindaa he
 Humans cannot live where he was kept
 wo maut kaa cameraa tha
 Lim is the one who had good luck and who somehow managed to escape from North Korea's death camps
 ye unheen kii aap beeti he
 But amidst these stories of pain, listen to the voice that has seen all this happening in front of your eyes
 lim ne kiya he khaufnak khulhasalim haai-jin vahi mahila guard he, jisane north korea ke is taanashaah kii hakeekat duniya ke saamne laakar use benakaab kar diya he
 In the torture camps with women, this vandalism was taking place
 vahaan lim maujuud thi
 He has seen everything with his eyes
 usne dekha he ki kaise uski saathi purush guard mahila kaidiyon ke saath jaanwaron kii tarah badasluki kar rahe the
 She has seen how women prisoners were abducted in a very brutal manner while pregnant
 lim haai-jin ke is khulaase se puri duniya sakate main he
 Lim, who fled South Korea to South Korea, made this disclosure in an interview to an English newspaper
 lim ne bataaya ki kaise yatnaa shiviron main kaidiyon ko maamuli baat par jaan se maar diya jaataa he
 Women are burnt alive on opposing rape
 lim ko sataata he hatya kaa daranarth korea se bhaagane vaali lim haai jin kahati hai ki vahaan paharedaaron kaa brinwash kar diya jaataa tha
 He was said not to sympathize with the prisoners
 jane anjaane kaidiyon par usne bhi sitam kiye unhen yatnaayen di
 Or seen him being oppressed, he now regrets it and guilt too
 apni ankhon ke saamne yatnaa or balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ko dekhne ke baad vah kai dinon tak khaanaa nahin kha pai thi
 Lim Hye-jin is currently in South Korea, exposing the dictatorship of North Korea's eccentric dictator to the whole world
 magar phir unhen har pal ye dar sataata he ki kim jong un ke aadmi kabhi bhi unka qatl kar sakate hai
 Two to three thousand prisoners die every year
 Actually, the extent of cruelty ends
 uske aage kii kahani vahaan shuru hoti he
 And in front of this same cruelty of Kim Jong Un, one to two prisoners die every day in jails
 or torchar room main jab laashen jamaa ho jaati hai to unhen ek saath ek gaddhe main rakhkar jala diya jaataa he
 Statistics show that every year, since Kim came to power, the torture of 2 to 3 thousand prisoners here and their hunger stops
 north korea main log bhagwaan se sirf ek hi dua karte hai ki unase aisi koi bhi galati na ho ki unhen vahaan kii chaar diwaariyon main kaid hona pade
 Because they know that this freak dictator will show them the same soul before he dies
 or vahaan kaid hone ke baad nikalnaa namumican he

 sudhir sharma kii daan main di hui zamin par hi aar es es ke vigyaan bharti kaa daftar he
 According to the report received by NDTV, Sudhir Sharma used to get cash in lakhs of rupees regularly from two colleges related to Vyapam scam
 iskar adhikariyon ke mutabik jis din ye paisa sudhir sharma ko miltaa tha usee din ye madhyapradesh ke ek mantri ke sahyogi ko pahunch jaataa he
 This is honesty
 meri eemaandaaree ye he ki maine barkhaa dutt or abhishek sharma kii report kaa laabh uthaakar aapako bataa diya

 In the scam which is still under investigation, there is someone who has got a clean chit

 The comments digvijay singh ne kaha ki wo to ye baat paanch saal se kah rahe hai
 Sudhir Sharma used to ride a scooter in 2003-04
 das saal main samrajya khadaa kar liya
 This man had a nexus with the leaders of the RSS and the BJP
 iskar vibhaag ke jin logon ne chaape maare the unhen hataa diya gaya
 The RSS BJP fears that if action is taken against Shivraj, he will open his eyes
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha he ki jab tak mukhyamantri istipha nahin dete isaki jaanch nishpaksh nahin ho sakati he
 BJP is not involved in this debate
 sudhir sharma kii bhoomika kya vyaapman ghotaale ke taar ko vyaapman se aage nahin le jaati he
 Understand the silence of the RSS or restlessness that the business people will forget as soon as the media cools down

 Prime time pataa chalaa he ki film 'i dil he mushkil' kaa theme anariquited lav he, jiskaa hindi main jab arth nikaalane kii koshish kii, to bada mushkil niklaa, apratidutt
 Well, even if the words sound alien, it is not so difficult to feel
 apni to aadhi qaom hi iskaa shabdaarth naa sahi, bhavarth samajhati zindagi guzaar leti he, or wo he -aisa pyaar jiske badale main pyaar naa mili
 And easily understood, one sided love
 ramakatori ke saath bhi meraa prem-prasang aisa hi tha
 i was deeply in love and Ramkatori had no regard for my feelings
 pehali nazar main hone vaale pyaar par shaq hona vaazib he, lekin ramakatori ke liye jis tarah se prem graph meraa chadha tha, vah bahut hi santulit tareeqe se paravaan par pahunchaa tha
 But i do not know why Ramkatori cheated me many times
 adwani ji or mujhamen ek samanta he
 He also remembers many things
 mujhe bhi
 He remembers with folding hands and i slammed on the keyboard
 or wo raat smaraneey to thi hi
 It was also Diwali night
 diwali kii raat isliye ho gai kyonki shaam nahin ho pai
 One of our bosses put me to work and it turned into a straight night on a Diwali afternoon
 aisa nahin tha ki diwali main koi zordaar celibrasion kaa hisaab kitaab tha meri life main
 In the firecrackers, there was no special love, but since self-pity was the ideal daily duty, it was a natural feeling to get out of the mind
 to nikle ofis se midnite ke aasapaas
 And then the journey was from Noida to Delhi
 tyohaar kii raat main kaam karne ke liye dukh manaane kaa pier-pressure se dur jate hi main raste or mausam kaa haule haule mazaa lete hue nikal gaya
 It would have been half the distance that Ramkatori betrayed me a second time
 isse pehle usne mujhe june kii dupahari main dhokhaa diya tha
 Half of Noida Toll Bridge
 or tab use do kilometre garmi main thelne main jo meri haalat karaab hui thi, wo main hi jaanata hum
 But the story was very bad on Diwali night
 ek to aadhi raat ke paar phir diwali
 In which there was a lot of noise of firecrackers, but there was silence on the streets
 pehle to main moolchand se south ekstansion kii taraf gaya
 If there was a small bike, the rear tire can go a little far after sitting on the tank when punctured, but the Ramkatori comes from the Bullet family
 or upar se pataa chalaa ki galat disha main daanv khel gaya tha
 There was silence at the petrol pump
 ab ek hi rasta tha, waapas jaakar mathura road panchar vaale ko pakadaa jaae
 Simultaneously, the time had come for me to call my family and tell them that i was trapped, i would be late
 phone ke zariye putr dharm kaa nirvaah karte vakt laga ki phone ke duusare sire par pitru-dharm kaa nirvaah karte hue meri khabar se doctor sahab bahut kanvince nahin hue, par 'thik he' jawaab aa gaya
 i was also of such age, whose age group has a very low CIBIL rating of credibility
 par ye mimasaa aaj likh rahaa hum, us vakt to 'wat-evar' sochakar aage bad gaya tha
 So, going to the other side on the ring road, started the steps again
 ab south-eks se waapas phir do-teen kilometre kii duuri chalane ke baad achaanak mere andar kaa dilip kumaar jaagane laga or andar kaa talat mahmud gane laga- i dil mujhe aisi jagah le chal jahaan koi naa ho
 
 
 And breaking this very spiritual moment, the sound of some horn was heard
 gum kar dekha -ek bike par ek bhai baitha he
 Whatever words i have diluted from the rest of this memoir, i still remember his question clearly
 usne poocha- kya hua brother?tippaniyan i will not go to Bhavatirek, i will not say that he came as an angel
 wo bilkul ek vaisaa insaan tha, jaisaa ki main maanata rahaa hum ki insaan hota he, jo kai logon se bahes karke thakne vaale mere jaise insaan kii madad karne aayaa tha, yahi sabit karne ki is tarah ke log duniya main hai
 Sometimes we get aisa shaks jo kisi anjaan biker ko pareshaani main dekhakar rukta he, madad ke liye poochta he or phir apane safar ko roak kar mathura road jaataa he, mechainic ko auzaar ke saath bitha kar laata he, pahiyaa khulavaa kar vaapis le jaataa he or phir panchar thik karvaa kar laata he
 The man who reinvigorated my belief that even though the atmosphere has been cut-through, postpone your festival and think for others
 diwali kii tamaam non-yaadgaar raaton main, mere or ramakatori ke liye diwali kii wo raat sabase yaadgaar rahi
 Today, after so many years, the reason for his recollection is the same, which was due to his arrival, where again, trust in human sympathy has started to reverberate in the midst of questions like hammer
 main ummid kar rahaa hum ek baar phir se meraa bharosa majboot karne koi nayaa brother aayega
 There is a similarity between Advani and me
 unhen bhi bahut si baaten samaran hoti rahati hai
 me too
 wo haath mel mel kar samaran karte hai or main keyboard par haath patake patake kar
 And that night was memorable
 wo bhi diwali kii raat thi
 The night of Diwali happened because it could not be evening
 hamaare kisi bos main se ek ne mujhe kaam par tikaa diya or diwali kii dopaher sidhi raat main tabdeel ho gai
 It was not that there was any strong celebration in Diwali in the book My Life
 die-pataakhon main khaas mubtila the nahin apan, par chunki aatm-dayaa karnaa adarsh dainik kartavya hua karata tha, to buje man se nikalnaa swaabhaavik bhav tha
 So got out of the office around midnight
 or tab kaa safar nauida se dilli kaa tha
 On my way away from the peer-pressure of celebrating the misery of working on the night of the festival, i went out enjoying the road and the weather after a while
 aadhi duuri tay kii hogi ki ramakatori ne duusari baar mujhe dhokhaa diya
 Earlier he cheated on me in June's twilight
 noida toll brij ke aadhe main
 And then i was the only one to know that my condition had deteriorated in pushing him in two kilometers of heat
 par diwali kii raat main to kahani bahut karaab thi
 One is Diwali again beyond midnight
 jisamen shor to bahut tha pataakhon kaa, lekin sadakon par sannata tha
 First i went from Moolchand towards South Extension
 koi choti bike hoti to pichhlaa tair panchar hone par tank par baith kar kuch dur tak to ja sakate hai, par ramakatori to bullate parivaar se aati he
 And it was revealed above that the bets were played in the wrong direction
 petrol pump par sannata tha
 Now there was only one way, go back to the Mathura Road Puncher
 saath hi vakt aa chukaa tha ki main apane gharavaalon ko phone karke bataa duun ki main funs chukaa hum, let ho jaaoongaa
 While subscribing to the son's religion through the phone, i felt that on the other end of the phone, while doing the paternalism, my news did not get very converting, but the 'OK' answer came
 meri umr bhi aisi thi, jis aij group kii credibility kaa sybil reating kaafii lo hota he
 But i am writing this philosophy today, at that time i had moved forward thinking 'what-ever'
 to ring road par duusari said jaakar phir kadamtal shuru kiya
 Now after walking two-three kilometers back from south-x again, suddenly Dilip Kumar inside me started waking up and Talat Mehmood started singing - o heart take me to a place where no one is there
 
 
 or is bahut hi aadhyatmik kshan ko todate hue kuch horn kii awaz sunai di
 Looked around - a brother is sitting on a bike
 is sansmaran kii baaqi baton ko maine jitna bhi shabd krida se dilut kiya ho, lekin uskaa sawaal ajtak spasht yaad he
 He asked - what happened brother? Comments main bhavatirek main nahin jaaoongaa, ye nahin kahuunga ki koi farishta ban kar vah aayaa tha
 He was exactly the kind of person, as i have been believed to be a human being, who came to help a tired person like me after arguing with many people, to prove that such people are in the world
 yada kada milte rahete hai
 a person who stops seeing an unknown biker in trouble, asks for help and then stops his journey and goes to Mathura Road, sets up the mechanic with tools, gets the wheel back and then punches Heals it
 wo aisa shaks jisane meraa bharosa phir se majboot kiya ki maahaul bhale hi cat-throt ho gaya he par, apane tyohaar ko postapon karke dusron ke liye sochataa he
 Of all the non-memorable nights of Diwali, Diwali was the most memorable night for me and Ramkatori
 aaj itane saalon ke baad uski yaad aane kii vajah vahi he, jo uske aane kii thi, jahaan phir se lagaataar hathode jaise sawaalon ke bich insaan ke bheetar kii hamadardi par se bharosa dolane laga he
 i am hoping that once again a new brother will come to strengthen my confidence
 tyohaar kii raat main kaam karne ke liye dukh manaane kaa pier-pressure se dur jate hi main raste or mausam kaa haule haule mazaa lete hue nikal gaya
 It would have been half the distance that Ramkatori betrayed me a second time

 kapoor) on Feb 10, 2017 at 6:05am PST a passenger in the Australian city of Brisbane burnt alive by putting flammable material on a bus driver

 These are the mistakes that we make every day and it hurts our health
 1
 Sleeping late at night Often we sleep late at night
 puri neend nahin lene ke kaaran khaane-pine kii aadaten bigadati hai
 We tend to eat more often
 2
 Brushing Immediately After Breakfast Many people start brushing immediately after having breakfast
 isse daant kamjor hote hai
 One should brush at least 40 minutes after eating
 3
 Repeatedly face the face, people turn their hands at least four times in an hour
 isse twachaa main bacteria chale jate hai, jo twachaa ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 4
 sone jane se pehle phone check karnasone jane se pehle phone ko check karnaa sabase kharaab aadaton main se he
 This reduces sleep and also increases the risk of stroke
 sone se pehle phone ko bilkul dur rakhana chahie
 5
 sanscreen kaa istemaal na karnadhup se khud ko bachaana bahut jaruri he
 Sunscreen should be used not only in summer but also in winter
 agar aapako lagata he ki pregnancy aapako aage badhane se roak degi or ye nau maheene aap bandha jaaengi to karina kapur khan kaa udhaaharan aapke saamne he
 On December 20, Kareena Kapoor gave birth to a healthy baby
 ise lekar di gai statement main saf ne bataaya ki karina or unka nanha betaa taimur ali khan pataudi, donon swasth hai
 In fact, after crossing the age of 30, with such a healthy and active pregnancy, Kareena has given an example to today's girls that pregnancy can be normal without any tension
 vaise, pregnancy ke dauraan body main hone vaale badlaavon ko ladkiyaan, khaastaur par varking, sahajata se nahin le paatin or ise ek beemaari maan leti hai
 Somewhere stop and go, office work, always bed rest, get up and sit with the support of others, take help of others to lift down the fallen etc
 vaastavik sthiti se zyada kai baar ve ise dimag par boj kii tarah le leti hai
 kareena-saif's son Taimur will have this relationship with the Bachchan family
 
 
 jaane kahaan hogi karina kii deliverivaise aap bhi agar pregnent hai or apni pregnancy ko asaani se lenaa chaahati hai to aaiye karina kapur se kuch tips lete hai
 
 
 These 5 things make Kareena Kapoor Khan a pregnant queen
 
 
 body change ko lekar comforteblepregnancy ke dauraan body main kai badlaav hote hai
 There are also some hormonal changes, which cause mood swings
 par in badlaavon se ghabaraaen nahin
 As the baby grows in your womb, there will be changes in your body
 aapkaa vajan badhegaa, ho saktaa he aapke bal bhi girane lagen
 Some women eat less food to keep their body in shape
 yah maa or bachche donon ke liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Life Line gynecologist Renu Chawla said that the less stress you take during pregnancy during your body change, the better it will be
 darasal, pregnancy main stress maa or baccha donon ke thik nahin hota
 Kareena, despite being a celebrity, proved how easy body changes can be taken
 pregnancy main stylish dikhelpani puri pregnancy ke dauraan karina kapur khan style iken bani raheen
 His dressing style and style of carrying himself were well liked
 par kuch varking women pregnancy main khud ko fishan se dur hi rakhti hai
 There are changes in the body during pregnancy, so women are advised to wear loose-fitting clothes
 lekin karina ne is maamle main style deeva kaa apana tag barkaraar rakhaa
 These looks of Kareena Kapoor Khan will also make you a fashionable in pregnancy
 
 
 30 ke baad pregnancy aasaan ho sakati heaishwarya raay ke baad ab karina kapur ne bhi yah sabit kar diya ki 30 saal ke baad bhi healdi pregnancy ho saktaa he
 Actually, a common belief about pregnancy is that after 30 years of pregnancy there are many complexities, which can be a problem for both the child and the mother
 karina kapur ne ek healdi bachche ko janm diya he or khud bhi swasth hai
 Dr
 renu chawla ke mutabik ye baat thik he ki 30 ke baad hamaare sharir main kai badlaav hote hai, par apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhkar aap apni pregnancy ko healdi pregnancy bana sakati hai
 Drink enough water, eat healthy, stay away from fast food and eat fresh fruits, even after 30, there are no problems in pregnancy
 
 
 
 So Kareena Kapoor will give birth to her first child on this day! Pregnancy glow is real beauty
 Kareena Kapoor is beautiful, there are no two opinions in this
 par pregnancy main bhi unka glo kam nahin hua
 But it would not be wrong to say that his Noor had increased
 aise main aap bhi karina kapur se inspireshan le sakati hai
 Light makeup and happy mood will make your pregnancy a memorable time like Kareena
 kaam par waapas aane kaa jajbapregnancy kii vajah se karina ke kaam karne is jazbe par koi asar nahin aayaa
 He is planning to start shooting in a month
 nai maa bani mahilaon ke bare main ek aam dharna yah bhi he ki maa banane ke baad mahilaayein kaam ko lekar gambhir nahin rahati
 But before delivery, Kareena has expressed that the child is a part of her life, but she will keep the same commitment regarding her work
 saf ne kii aane vaale nanhe mehmaan ke liye shopping, kharida ye mahangaa giftsaavdhaan rahen or active bhikrina kapur maa banane vaali hai, yah khabar sunate hi sabane kayaas lagane shuru kar die ki ab karina shaayad public placeform par kam dikhen
 But it did not happen
 wo apni public life utani hi active thim
 Dr
 renu chawla ke mutabik pregnancy ke dauraan aap jitani active rahengi, bachche or maa ke liye utana hi acha rahegaa
 This is the reason that she did not face any complication until Kareena became a mother
 yah baat har pregnent aurat ke liye he
 So stay active
 lekin sehat or chalane-phirane ko lekar saavdhaanee bhi baraten

 Senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan, who is going to hear the Ayodhya land dispute case on 18th day today, argued the arguments of the Muslim parties
 is dauraan muslim paksh kii taraf se varisht vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki civil suut main tathyon or saakshyon par swaamitv or adhikaar ko sabit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 He said that there is no evidence to show exclusive ownership of Hindus on disputed property
 isapar justise bobade ne poocha ki aap kiski paatrata ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 On this, Rajiv Dhawan said that he is talking about the eligibility of the land
 yadi adaalat devtaa ke swymbhu swaroop par unke tark ko sweekaar karti he, to puri sampatti unke paas jaani chahie
 Muslims will get nothing
 lekin ve isapar apana adhikari jataa rahe hai
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the presence of pillars is indicated, but the columns do not indicate any particular religion
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hinduo kaa daawa he ki bich vaale gumbad ke neeche hi raamji kaa janm hua tha
 The Muslim side says how can you say that Rama was born there
 itnaa bada strecchar he aap kaa daawa thos tathyon par aadhaarit nahin he
 Even if for a while assume that the birth took place there, what is the point of making the claims of circumambulation? On 23 August 1989, the Sunni Waqf Board became a party to the trial
 janmasthan ko ramajanm bhoomi kehete hue hinduo ne daawa kiya ki wo hameshaa se unke kabje main rahaa
 Now there is a lot of difference and confusion in the meaning of birthplace and birthplace
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii daleelon main ek nai baat jodi gai ki jin logon ne 1992 main masjid giraayi thi, ve shararti tatv the or unka hinduon se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 If they were not Hindus then who were they
 isse pehle rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki babari masjid main bhagwaan ramalala kii murti sthapit karnaa chal se kiya hua hamalaa he
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu Mahasabha has said that it will go to the government on this issue
 dhawan ne puraani tasviren court main pesh kar daawa kiya ki vivaadit imaarat main madhya vaale mehrab ke upar arabi lipi main babar or allaah utkeern tha
 Apart from this, Kalma was also written
 uttari mehrab main bhi kellingraphy yani kalatmak likhaai main teen baar allaah likhaa tha
 Ram Ram was also written nearby
 unhone kaha ki jagmohan das laal sahu kii khinchi gai tasviren hai
 No one can even say that the Muslim photographer has taken it
 dashakon tak vahaan taala padaa rahaa
 Every Friday the lock opened and we continued to offer namaz
 phir bhi ye kah rahe hai ki wo masjid nahin thi
 Justice Bhushan and Justice Bobde asked if you would also present a picture of a pillar
 Dhawan did not give a clear answer to this
 rajin dhawan ne kaha ki iskaa sidhaa matlab to yahi he ki court kaa ye adhikaar kshetra nahin he
 Such shows should be stopped 'and no rath yatra
 'muslim paksh kii taraf se rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii daleel he ki muslim paksh ke paas vivaadit jameen ke kabje ke adhikaar nahin he, na ho lekin muslim paksh vahaan namaaj adaa karata rahaa he
 The reason behind this is that the Nirmohi Arena in 1934 wrongly took illegal possession
 iske baad hamen namaaj nahin adaa karne diya gaya
 Rajiv Dhawan said that we can say that both the sides continue to worship there, but how can we say that there was no mosque there
 dhawan ne ek tasvirnuma nakshaa dikhaakar kaha ki 1480 gaj kaa bhure rang kaa hissaa devtaa or nirmohi akhaade ko diya he
 Part of the 740 square square was given to Muslim parties
 unhone aage kaha ki 1947 main dilli main todi gai 30 masjidon ko tab ke piem pandit nehru ne phir se banane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On the other hand, there was KK Nair, a DM from Faizabad, who was saying that there was a temple in Faizabad, which was demolished
 baad main nair kii photo imaarat main lagaai gai
 It is clear that he was discriminating in favor of Hindus
