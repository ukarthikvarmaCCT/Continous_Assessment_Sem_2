 This government decides
 pakistan main yah dar paidaa ho gaya he ki bharat ab pioke ko waapas le legaa, isliye pakistan ne pioke kaa swaroop badalane kii prakriya shuru kii he
 He (pakistan) fears that India's next move may be pok
 isliye pakistan ne pioke ke prashasnic dhaanche main badlaav karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Now the administrative structure there has been renamed
 jitendra singh ne kaha kipiokeko lekar ek prastaav 1994 main paas kar diya gaya tha, lekin congress kii sarkaron ne isaki andekhi kii
 But now this will not happen

 He said that the Health Ministry has sought the opinion of the Law Ministry in this regard

 After ordering the all states to identify and hand over the list of Rohingya Muslims living in their area, the central government is now preparing an affidavit for filing in the Supreme Court
 centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki rohingya musalmaan sharnaarthiyon ke taur par bharat main nahin rah sakate hai
 The Center has termed Rohingya Muslims a threat to internal security
 haalanki rohingya muslimon ko lekar halafname par centre sarkaar ne ek pakshakaar ko patr likhaa he
 It says that the Central Government's affidavit was given to him, it had some cancer and was sent by mistake
 ab sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is halafname ko abhi bhi antim rup diya ja rahaa he, jo halafanama sarv kiya gaya he, wo final nahin he
 The intelligence report also mentions the Rohingya Muslims being associated with the terrorist organization
 iske mutabik rohingya aatanki samoohon ke taur par jammu-kashmir, dilli, hyderabad or mevaat main sakriy hai
 The Rohingyas can be used by terrorist organizations for Islamic State terrorist activities
 centre kii ye bhi daleel di he ki sanyukt raashtra ke niyamon ke tahat bhi bharat sarkaar avaidh rup se rahane vaale logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ko swatantra he
 At present, all eyes are on the hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday
 is maamle main do rohingya musalmaan bhi yachikakarta hai, jo bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 32 main moulik adhikaron ke hanan ke silsile main mili adhikaar ke tahat supreme court pahunche hai
 The Center has said that the Supreme Court cannot interfere in the government's action
 daleel ye di gai he ki jab rohingya musalamaanon kaa bharat main rahanaa hi moulik adhikaar nahin he, to aise main wo samvidhan ke anuchhed 32 ke tahat supreme court main apil karne kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar bhi nahin rakhte
 The deportation of Rohingyas is necessary for the security of the country
 kisi bhi avaidh apravasi kobharatamen rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 On the other hand, Rohingya Muslim refugees had said in the Supreme Court that they have nothing to do with terrorism and any terrorist organization
 apni yachika main rohingya samudaay ne ye bhi kaha ki unhen sirf musalmaan hone kii vajah se nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The petition filed on behalf of about 7 thousand Rohingya refugees living in Jammu said, 'we have nothing to do with terrorism
 yahaan tak ki jab se ham jammu main rah rahe hai, ham par aisa koi aarope nahin lage
 Not a single person from among us was found involved in terrorist activities

 The 68-year-old head of the Lok Janshakti Party heard the conscience once again on 27 February
 thik isi taarikh ko 12 saal pehle gujarat ke godhra main ek train kampartment main aagjanee or phir 21veen sadi ke bhishantam dange ke baad unhone atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar se istipha de diya tha
 12 years later, but the date is the same 27 February
 lok janashakti party ke supremeo apane rajnatik vaaris chiraag paswan ke saath dilli ke ashok road sthit bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ke ghar pahunchate hai

 And the issue of secularism can rest for the moment
 2002 main mukhyamantri ke rup main asweekaarya narendra modi ab paswan and sans ko pradhanmantri ke rup main kabool hai
 This is a step which Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is describing as a 'strange but true'
 avasarwaad express kii savariwaise, algepi-bijepi kaa duusari baar gathbandhan thos saamaajik samikarnon ke ganit par bandhaa he
 Paswan has got 7 seats under the alliance
 paswan ke liye isamen pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main safaaye ke baad bihar main punerjeevan kii sambhaavna chuphi he
 Last time Paswan himself lost the election from his traditional Hajipur seat after Lalu Prasad's alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) against the NDA
 duusari taraf narendra modi kii aguai vaali bijepi ke liye iske apratyaksh laabh zyada bade hai
 By the way, the electoral gains are also no less as Paswan holds close to 7 per cent of the votes
 lekin bijepi ke liye isse bhi badhkar phayda yah he ki unke saath aane se ek rashtriya sandesh jayega
 Paswan's return will strengthen Narendra Modi's candidature for the post of Prime Minister
 isse nae sambhavit sahyogiyon ke bich modi kii sweekaaryata kaa dayera badhegaa
 When the Sangh decided to make Modi the PM candidate on September 13, 2013, there was only one mantra - first the BJP will be strong, then think of the NDA
 —iske liye bijepi main sheersh str se uthi virodh kii aawaaj ko bhi najrandaaj kar diya gaya tha
 Now with the elections coming closer, the strategy of the Sangh seems to be fitting
 paswan ke saath gathbandhan se gadgad bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali kehete hai, ''jab modi ko piem ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya tha tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki bijepi rajnatik rup se alag-thalag pad jaaegi
 But i have always believed that only a strong BJP can lead a strong NDA
 ''majaburi kaa naam endiehalanki paswan ke liye bijepi pehali pasand nahin thi
 In October 2013, the LJP chief met RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav in Ranchi Jail
 tab unhone unase kaha tha ki 2014 ke chunaav main dashak bhar pehle argedy-algepi-congress gathjod kaa baari pradarshan ek baar phir doharaaya jayega, basharte ham siton kaa talmail sahi dhang se baitha len
 a few days later, Paswan along with his son Chirag had gone to Rabri Devi's residence in Patna to express his sympathy
 lekin paswan ko laga ki duusari taraf garmjoshi kaa abhaav he
 The distrust between the two parties was further aggravated by a statement by RJD senior leader and MP Raghuvansh Prasad Singh
 unhone algepi se kaha ki siton kii maang karne se pehle jeetne yogya ummidavaaron kii suchi jaahir karen
 Though the party lost all 12 seats including LJP Hajipur in 2009, the party lost 6
 55 fisadi vot mili the jo use gathjod ke yogya banaate hai
 In 2004, RJD, Congress and LJP won 29 parliamentary seats in Bihar
 paswan is baar bhi vahi pradarshan dohraane kii ummid kar rahe the lekin argedy kii udaseenta se unka mohabhang ho gaya
 Paswan also appealed to Congress President Sonia to initiate a coalition initiative in Bihar
 bijepi se nae sambandh ke bare main paswan kehete hai, ''maine maheenon unka intjaar kiya par koi faisla nahin ho paaya
 "paswan can still be a game changer in Bihar, provided he can get his votes to the alliance partner
" bihar main teen bade dalon ke vot pratishat—bijepi ke 13
 93 per cent (15 seats in 2009), 19 of RJD
 31 fisadi (2009 main 28 siton par) or jedy(you)ke 24
 At 04 per cent (25 seats in 2009) - if Paswan's Dalit votes are merged with any one, that alliance starts to be invincible
 algepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath gathjod kii vajah congress or argedy se algepi ko samuchit sammaan na milanaa he
 Actually Paswan's unhappiness was in the air and the saffron party was looking for this opportunity
 mauka dekhakar bihar main bijepi ke netaa shahanvaaj hossain or rajeev pratap rudi ne dore daal die
 There were several rounds of talks between the two parties
 kai main paswan ke bete chiraag ne hissaa liya
 Chirag is said to be the architect of Paswan's return to NDA
 paswan kaa kheme se alag ho janaa lalu prasad yadav ke liye bada jhtka he
 Talking to India Today, he said, "we tried to reach a compromise with Paswan ji till the last moment
" siton ko lekar koi jhagada nahin tha
 Lalu is also hurt that with his help Paswan got the seat of Rajya Sabha and his loot of the Lutyen Zone is retained, the wall of which is adjacent to Sonia Gandhi's 10 Janpath
 lalu ko ehsaas he ki congress kii taalamatol se unhen kitna nuksaan ho chukaa he
 Despite this, they keep beating, "we stopped LK Advani's riot rath yatra and we will stop Narendra Modi in Bihar too
" '' argedy netaaon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki paswan modi ke paksh main jane ko taiyaar nahin the
 But Paswan did not have one in front of his son Moh and the surrounding domineering leaders
 algepi ke netaaon ko pataa he ki un par narendra modi ke maamle main peeche hatane kaa aarope lagaaya jayega
 a senior LJP leader says, "but, this is the evil we will have to live with
" phir, bhavishya ganvaa baithne se behatar to yahi he ki vichaardhaara ke bina jinda rahaa jaae
 After all, even the Supreme Court has given a clean chit to Modi
 ''paswan rajnatik dhadkan pahchaanane main dusron se maahir maane jate hai
 The ability to read the writings written on the wall has made him a part of every government from 1996 to 2009, when he made the mistake of joining hands with Lalu except the Congress and lost the 2009 elections badly
 nai soshal ejineerinkub paswan ne bijepi se haath milakar har kisi ko chaunkaa diya he
 bjp's strategy is also to strengthen the backward and Dalit votes and give some more strength to the already flowing Modi wind and to improve social engineering
 centre main chah saal sarkaar chalaane or vikaas kii gathree sir par uthaakar 'india shining' kaa naaraa buland karne ke baavjood naakaam rahi bijepi ab yah jaanati he ki sirf modi lahar par puri tarah nirbhar nahin rahaa ja saktaa
 If the Modi wave is to be ruled by power, then social engineering will have to be done realizing the reality of the social fabric of the states
 kabhi vaajapeyi ke netritv main 24 dalon kaa indradhanushi gathbandhan teen dalon tak simat gaya tha
 Therefore, the BJP has focused on the social equation with the Modi wave
 kerala kii raily main narendra modi apni manshaa kaa khulaa izhaar kar chuke hai
 He described "the next decade now as Dalits-backward"
 ''haalanki soshal engineering kaa sabase bada falsafa team modi ko bihar main mila he, jahaan se bijepi ko sabase pehla bada jhatka modi ko party kii loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan samiti kii kaman saunpane ke baad jhelana padaa tha
 The JD (U), which had been part of the alliance for 17 years in Bihar, severed its relationship with the BJP
 haalanki modi kii kishti par savaar hone vaale dalon kaa modi prem se zyada apane astitv par aayaa sankat he
 The era of ayaram-gayaram has begun to maintain its existence politically

 BJP is giving three seats to Kushwaha's party
 is bich nitish kumaar kii party jedy(you) main bhi bhagdad much gai he or baagiyon ko lagaataar party se nikaala ja rahaa he
 At the same time, after the separation of JD (U), BJP estimates that its vote has reduced by at least 30-40 thousand in all Lok Sabha seats, which can be offset by the coming of Paswan and Kushwaha

 Shortly after the announcement of this alliance, the president of the Tamil Nadu opposition party DMK read praises to Modi and called him his friend

 Salman Khan is today a name that is considered to be a measure of success in Bollywood
 
 
 unki safalataa kaa record dekhte hue industry aaj un par bina soche-samajhe bhi karodon kii baazi lagane ke liye taiyaar rahati he
 
 
 Salman Khan is unquestionably the number one star of Bollywood
 
 
 sabase safal or sabase mahange star
 
 
 But apart from being a superstar, Salman Khan is also known for his negative image and controversies associated with his name
 
 
 salmaan khan kaa naata varsh 1998 main vivaadon se judaa tha, jo aaj bhi badastoor barkaraar he
 
 
 His name is not only associated with the case of illegal hunting, but he has also been accused from time to time on charges of drunk driving, committing parties and abusive speech
 
 
 vivaadon ke saath salmaan khan kaa naata sabase pehle varsh 1998 main judaa, jab 'blike bak', yani kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa aarope salmaan par laga
 
 
 Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Tabu were also surrounded by Salman in this case, but Salman's image got worse when he had to spend a few days in jail in this case
 
 
 iske baad salmaan kii chhavi par 'bigadel' kaa thappa tab laga, jab bollywood abhinetri aishwarya raay ke saath kathith rishte ke dauraan un par film set par pahunchakar or aishwarya ke ghar main marpet karne ke aarope lage, or pita saleem khan ko media ke saamne aakar safai pesh kerani padi
 
 
 Shortly after this charge, i
e
 in the year 2002, Salman Khan was accused of crushing five people in a drunken car, one of whom died
 
 
 yah maamla ab bhi court main he
 
 
 The controversy was in the news that in 2003, actor Vivek Oberoi held a press conference and made serious allegations like threatening Salman Khan
 
 
 lekin in sab aaropon ke bich bhi salmaan kii bigadati chhavi kaa asar unki filmon kii safalataa par nahin padaa, or ve kaamyaab hoti raheen
 
 
 But, on the one hand, his films continued to thrive amidst hearing of cases related to Salman Khan in different courts of the country, but on the other hand, Salman continued to engage in new controversies
 
 
 varsh 2008 main salmaan khan ke kareeb raheen abhinetri katrina caff ke janmdin par bhi kuch tasviren jari ho gayi, jo vivaad kaa kaaran baniin
 
 
 It was the same party in which there was a big fight between Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan
 
 
 bhale hi inamen se kuch maamle aaj bhi court main lambit hai, or jab-jab adaalatein inaki sunwaayee karti hai, unki puraani harakatein tivi screen par doharaani padati hai, lekin sachai yah he ki salmaan khan aaj bhi hamaari hindi film industry main number van star hai

 The case is that Anushka's neighbors had complained to BMC alleging that Anushka Sharma's family had installed an electric box without the permission of the society
 padosiyon ne ye bhi apni shikaayat main kaha tha ki usase kabhi bhi building main aag lag sakati he
 According to a report, Anushka lives on the 20th floor of Sharmavarsova's Badrinath building and her neighbor Sunil Batra owns the 16th and 17th floors of the building
 batra ne biemasi main shikaayat darj karai he
 Sunil had said that the big box that Anushka has installed outside her house goes through the wiring of the central AC along with the floor
 sunil ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki vah fire brigade niyamon kaa ulanghan he or hai court ne bhi nirdesh he ki kaaman raste main kisi prakaar kii baadha nahin honi chahie
 The BMC inspected the building on a clean chitikayat, after which a notice was sent to Anushka Sharma for putting up the box
 lekin do maheene baad hi maamla palat gaya he
 The Assistant Engineer (building and Factory Department) of BMC has written to Batra that the electrical box is on the wall of Anushka's house and the path which has been described as a common passage in the complaint is the property of Anushka's father
 vahiin is jawaab se anoushka ke padosi sunil santusht nahin hai
 He says that Anushka is getting the benefit of being a celebrity

 "he further said," There is no scope for the membership of AAP mlas to escape, as the Chief Secretary of the Government of Delhi himself, in his affidavit to the Commission, admitted that the mlas were given facilities like ministers
 dilli main 7 vidhayak mantri ho sakate hai, lekin inhone 28 bana die

 The author says that his talk was misinterpreted, which created an argument

 patil ne pavaar se kii mukaable se hatane kii apiladonon hi pakshon ne shandaar dinar kaa aayojan karke lagbhag 300 matadaata klbon or gymkhanon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii
 At his dinner party, Patil urged Pawar to withdraw from the match and bless the Cricket First panel
 iske jawaab main pavaar ne kaha ki vahshaayad chunaav nahin ladatrugar patil unase vaada karte ki emsie ko mili antarrashtriya or ipel maichon ko unke navi mumbai sthit divai patil sports academy stadium main yojit nahin kiya jayega
 Pawar still wants to bat: Shiv Sena Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has openly come in support of Patil
 unhone panel kii mangalvaar raat ko yojit dinar party main patil ke samarthan kii ghoshnaa kii
 He criticized Pawar for saying that legendary cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar had retired, but Pawar still wanted to continue batting while his score was zero despite being in the MCA for a long time
 har do saal main hone vaale in chunaavon main donon pakshon ke bich vakyuddh bhi chalaa
 In these elections, former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar is contesting on behalf of the pawar-mahadalkar faction for one of the two posts of vice president
 cricket first group ne purv test cricketron abhaya kuruvilla, lalchand rajput or praveen aamare ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 BJP mlas for the post of Vice President from Pawar faction, BJP mlas Ashish Shelar and Vengsarkar for the post of Vice President from Mewar Pawar faction, while Kuruvilla and Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnayak from the Cricket First Group are in the race for Vice President
 shivasena ke saansad rahul shevaale 11 sadasyeey prabandh samiti ke liye patil kii aguwai vaale gut se maidan main hai
 Pawar was the President of MCA for ten years from 2001 to 2011, after which he handed over the post to fellow leader Vilasrao Deshmukh
 deshmukh ke 2012 main nidhan ke baad ravi saavant antarim adhyaksh bane jiske baad pichley chunaavon main pavaar ko nirvirodh adhyaksh chun liya gaya tha

 Today is Subhash Chandra Bose Jayanti
 netaa ji kaa janm (subhash Chandra Bose Birthday) 23 janvari 1897 ko urisa ke katak main hua tha
 Subhash Chandra Bose was from a rich family
 netaa ji bachapan se hi padhai-likhaai main tej the or desh kii aazaadee main apana yogadan dena chaahate the
 Leaving the prestigious service of administrative service in 1921, Subhash Chandra Bose, who landed in the freedom struggle of the country, got wide support of the youth of the country due to his revolutionary ideas
 jiske baad unhone aaazaad hind fouj (azad Hind Fauj) kaa gathan kiya
 He told the youth who are admitted in Azad Hind Fauj, "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" '' kaa ospurn naaraa diya
 Subhas Chandra Bose, as Commander of the Azad Hind Fauj, formed the provisional government of India, which was recognized by Germany, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Italy, Manchuko and Ireland
 14 saal choti ladki se hua subhash chandra bose ko pyaar, donon ne yun aakhri saans tak nibhaayaa rishta Now soon you will be able to go to the airport by taking the Aadhar card
 ab tak aadhaar card ko vahaan pahchaan patron kii shrenee main jagah nahin mili thi
 The government has allowed the use of Aadhaar for the SIM card and will now be able to enter the airport with it
 ek angreji akhbaar ne yah khabar di he
 It is said that the Ministry of Home Affairs has accepted that the Aadhar card holders should be allowed to enter the airport
 lekin yah kuch alag tarah se hoga
 For this, the passenger has to put his thumb on the biometric machine installed at the airport door
 iske saath hi aadhaar card main darj uskaa huliya tathaa anya vivaran prakat ho jaaenge
 The CISF officer posted there will investigate him

 Under this, the biometric machines near the CISF will be linked to the Aadhaar card-making organization UIDAI, which will give all kinds of information about the cardholder in a blink of an eye
 bollywood ke badshaah shahrukh khan par chori kaa bhaashan dene kaa aarope laga he
 It is alleged that the speech given by Shah Rukh at an event organized by All India Management Association (AIMA) in September last month is theft
 aapako bataa den ki AIMA main die gaye bhaashan par shahrukh kii khub vaahvahee hui thi
 But now, Shahrukh has come under the scanner
 shahrukh par chori kaa bhaashan dene kaa aarope ek soshal media kansaltent agratha dinakaran ne apane blog main lagaaya he
 He has said that the speech given by Shah Rukh is an imitation of the famous Harry Potter series by JK Rowling at Harvard University
 blogar ne likhaa he, 'shahrukh ne jeke roling ke bhaashan kii panktiyon kii hu-ba-hu nakal kii or unhen iskaa credit bhi nahin diya
 Some parts of his speech have been completely stolen
 'blogar agratha dinakaran ne apane blog main likhaa he ki unhen shahrukh kaa bhaashan kaaphi shandaar or prerak laga
 He further wrote, 'I am not a big fan of him (shah Rukh), but i was very impressed by his speech
 main abhi teen pannon ke bhaashan main se pehla panna pard rahi thi
 After this, when i read the second page, i felt like his speech was heard
 lekin mujhe kuch dhyaan nahin aayaa
 Further, when i read the last page where Shahrukh was finishing the speech, i felt that i must have read it somewhere before
 yah 2008 main harvard main jeke roling kaa shuruaati bhaashan tha
 'blogger wrote that Rowling spoke about the days of struggle in his life while delivering a speech at Harvard University in 2008 on' the small benefits of failure and the importance of imagination '
 unhone ne kaha tha, 'garibi koi mahaan banane vaala anubhav nahin hota
 Poverty leads to fear, stress and sometimes depression
 iskaa matlab he kadam-kadam par apmaan, jillat or mushkilen
 Blogger Agratha says that Shah Rukh's speech has stolen not only the idea of rolling but also his words
 unhone kaha tha, 'main aapako bataa duun ki garibi koi mahaan banane vaala anubhav nahin he
 Poverty leads to fear, stress and sometimes depression
 maine bahut baar apane maa-baap ko isse jujhate hue dekha he
 This means insults, ravages and difficulties at every step
 'agratha ke mutabik, 'ho saktaa he ki unka (shahrukh) bachapan bhi garibi bharaa rahaa ho
 They may also have lived in poverty
 ho saktaa he ki apni asafalataaon ke baad unhone bahut kuch hasil kiya ho
 But is it right to steal someone's words without giving them credit? For me, this is disgusting and disrespectful to Rolling
 mujhe ummid he ki ab media shahrukh ke bhaashan kii tarif karnaa band karegi or logon ko bataaegi ki unke bhaashan ke ansh vastav main kahaan se aae hai
 'agratha has also uploaded a video of Rolling's speech at the end of her blog
 udhar, shahrukh khan kii chif digital streregist shailaja ne shahrukh kaa paksh rakhte hue kaha he ki shahrukh ne apni spich main jeke rolling ko spich kaa credit diya he
 But he also said that srk's speech has nothing to do with JK Rowling's speech
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke siem chehre bies yediurppa aaj shimoga ke shikarpura vidhansabha seat se namakan patr daakhil kiya
 Before enrolling, he went to the Yeddyrappa temple and offered prayers
 iske baad road sho ke jariye namakan karne pahunche the
 Many people including Muslim women were involved in this
 yediurppa ke saath chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh or kendriya mantri anant kumaar maujuud the
 During the nomination filing, BS Yeddyurappa while talking to Aaj Tak said that this election will be very good
 janata ke saport kii jitani ummid kar the usase zyada mil rahaa he
 The people of the state are with the BJP
 unhone kaha, ham purna bahumat praapt karne ja rahe hai
 Yeddyurappa said that Siddaramaiah has lost public confidence
 ve apane vidhansabha kshetra chamundeshwari main hi chintit hai
 They are not going to win in the state
 yediurppa ko namakan ke liye jyotish ne dopaher main muhoort kaa suzav diya he
 He is doing the Roche show before nominating
 iske baad jyotish dwaara sujhaaye gaye muhoort ke samay ve apana namakan patr daakhil karenge
 bjp's return to power in Karnataka rests on Yeddyurappa
 shikarpura main yediurppa kii jeet ke liye unke bete raghavendra chunaav prachaar kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai
 Significantly, from Kishikarpura assembly seat, Congress has fielded the corporation member and GB Maltesh of Kurba community against Yeddyurappa
 vahiin jedies ne majboot lingayat samudaay ke ummidavaar achti baligar ko utaara he
 While the Lingayat-dominated seat Shikarpurase is the BJP and JDS candidates from the Lingayat community, the Congress has played the card of the Korba community
 haalanki congress netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko ummid thi ki yediurppa ke saamne party kisi majboot lingayat netaa ko is seat se utaaregi
 Mahalingappa, a former MLA from Shikarpura, was considered a strong contender for a ticket from the Congress
 mahalingappa ne 1999 main congress ke tikat se ladakar yediurppa ko haraaya tha
 Shantavirappa Gowda was among the other Congress contenders
 shanthavirappa gauda yediurppa ke bete raghavendra se 2014 upachunaavon main lagbhag 6 hajaar voton se haare the
 But recently, he has joined BJP
 congress se tikat ke daavedaaron main teesraa naam congress ke purv jila adhyaksh prasanna kumaar kaa tha
 Being close to Siddaramaiah, he was believed to be able to contest from Shikarpura seat
 lekin party ne unhen bhi niraash kiya
 It is believed that the Congress party has made it very easy for Yeddyurappa by removing Maltesh from Shikarpura seat
 maltesh lingayat samudaay se bhi nahin aate hai, wo kurba hai
 In such a situation, the candidate of Kurba community has been fielded against Yeddyurappa from Lingayat dominated seat
 maltesh kurba ke utarane ke chalate yediurppa ke saamne pichhadi jatiyon or essi, asti voton ko saadhane kii chunauti hogi
 The JDS has fielded a stronger Lingayat community candidate HT Baligar than the Congress against Yeddyurappa
 baligar shikarpura seat jeetne ke puri takat se jute gaye hai
 However, only time will tell how successful the Congress' Kurba card will be between the two Lingayats

 Sachin started his career six years earlier than Dravid but in terms of runs, Dravid is seen to be stepping in with Sachin, considered the greatest batsman in the world
 shatakon kii daud main dravid beshak sachin se peeche hai lekin bharat kii ore se doosraa sabase adhik shatak lagane vaala ballebaaj hona is baat kii pushti karata he ki dravid maidan main sachin se kisi maamle main kam nahin

 In a lecture on the subject of 'current Economic decline-impact and Measures' on Saturday at the Mahatma Gandhi Mission Campus in Maharashtra, Desarda said that in 2013 the price of crude oil was $ 110 per barrel
 unhone kaha, 'narendra modi kii sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad kachche tel kii keemton main giravat ai
 At that time the government spent huge amount on import of crude oil to meet the demand of petrol and diesel
 ' maharashtra rajya yojana board ke purv sadsy desarada ne kaha, 'sarkaar ko is vittiya laabh kaa istemaal rojgaar guarantee yojana, jal sansaadhan vikaas, baadh or sookhaa niyantran par karnaa chahie tha
 But the government could not take advantage of this opportunity
 'desarada ne kaha ki bijepi kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ne sadakon ke nirmaan par baari raashi kharch kii
 As a result, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has a debt burden of three lakh crore rupees and has to pay an interest of Rs 25,000 crore on it
 unhone daawa kiya ki toll tex se 7,000 karod rupee se adhik praapt nahin ho rahe hai
 Desarada said that the imbalance of spending and profits should be removed

 He said that it is unfortunate that the government did not pay attention to improving the standard of living of the country's large population
 uskaa dhyaan sirf chunaav jeetne par rahaa
 The government wants to connect people with emotional issues but it will not last long
 desarada ne kaha ki sarkaar ek tarah daawa kar rahi he ki vah jaivik kheti ko protsaahan de rahi he duusari ore vah rasayan vaale urvarkon ko badhaava dene main juty he
 He said that now the government is reducing taxes to remove industrial lethargy

 Amit Azad, son of Shaheed Chandrashekhar Azad's nephew, protested to install the statue of Arjun Singh in place of Martyr Azad's statue in Bhopal, saying that it is an insult to the martyrs
 zyada unchi murti usee jagamamit aaazaad ne kaha ki unhone is maamle main rajyapal lalji tandon or bhopal meyar alok sharma se mulaakaat kii he or is baat par hairaani jataai ki jis vajah se shahid aaazaad singh kii murti ko tirahe ke bich se hataaya tha, vahaan ab arjuna singh kii zyada oonchai vaali murti kaise laga di gai
 While the Municipal Corporation had removed the idol of one and a half feet martyr Azad Singh, stating that there was a hindrance in traffic operations and now a much higher statue has been installed at the same place
 amit aaazaad ne kaha he ki 2 disambar tak yadi arjuna singh kii pratimaa ko nahin hataaya jayega to wo anshan karenge
 Arjun Singh's statue, in this case, Bhopal Mayor Alok Sharma says that the statue of Shaheed Azad Singh was removed by the Municipal Corporation itself, but at the same place, the statue of Arjun Singh was installed keeping the MIC of BJP ruled Municipal Corporation in the dark
 is
 meyar ne bataaya ki arjuna singh kii pratimaa lagane kaa koi prastaav emisi main paarit nahin hua, aise main adhikariyon par sawaal khadey hota he ki unhone aisa kyon kiya?bataa den kibhopal ke new market tirahe par purv mukhyamantri arjuna singh kii murti laga di gai he, jiskaa abhi locarpan nahin hua he
 At the same time, the BJP has objected that when the statue of Shaheed Azad Singh was removed keeping in mind the traffic from there, then why the statue of Arjun Singh was installed there
 is vivaad ke baad se hi ab tak pratimaa kaa locarpan bhi nahin ho paaya he

 Shibu Soren alias Guru ji, who played an important role in getting Jharkhand a separate statehood status, will probably continue to walk out of the corridor of power on Sunday night
 lekin unke liye is tarah kursi se haath dhone kaa yah koi pehla mauka nahin he
 He has resigned from the top posts six times in the last six years after getting into some rough ordeal
 ise bhagya kaa khel kahen yaa vakt kaa takaza ki 5 varshon ke bheetar shibu sorain teesri baar chand dinon ke bheetar jharkhand kii kursi se beabaru hokar baahar ho gayi
 Earlier on 11 March 2005, Guru ji resigned as Chief Minister after failing to get a majority in the state assembly
 ek baar phir 12 janvari 2009 ko guru ji ko vidhansabha upachunaav main haar ke chalate mukhyamantri pad se istipha dekar satta se baahar hona padaa tha
 Guru ji did not just depart from the post of Chief Minister three times, but also three times in the last six years, he also got entangled in a dispute with the Union Cabinet in some way or the other
 kendriya mantrimandal se pehali baar guruji ko 24 july 2004 ko chirudih narsanhaar ke maamle main jamtada kii ek adaalat se gairajamaanti warrant jari hone par istipha dena padaa tha
 After this, on 2 March 2005, he resigned from the Union Cabinet to take over the throne of the Chief Minister of Jharkhand but from there he had to resign after nine days
 guru ji ko teesri baar 28 november 2006 ko us samay kendiy mantrimandal se istipha dena padaa tha jab unhen apane sachiv shashinath jha kii hatya ke maamle main dilli kii ek adaalat ne sajaa sunaayi thi
 This time again, Guru ji formed the government in the state along with BJP AJSU and JD u on 30 December after the assembly elections held in November last year and took the oath of Chief Minister but only after the withdrawal of bjp's support in just five months He had to submit the resignation of his government in a minority to Governor moh Farooq

 lekin aakhirkaar in donon sawaalon kaa jawaab mil gaya he

 us vakt maan baba (salmaan ko pyaar se rekha isi naam se bulaati hai) mere peeche-peeche ghoomane jate the
 After returning from the walk, Salman often used to tell his mother that he would grow up and marry me

 It is a long process
 isliye court ko is tarah ke aadesh jari nahin karne chahie

 bhiwandi kapadaa factory kii imaarat girane ke maamle main teen or shav milane ke baad marane waalon kii sankhya bad kar chah ho gai he
 Police said two bodies were recovered from the debris of the two-story building of the textile factory last night and a body was found during the cleaning this morning
 bhiwandi ke kalher gaanv main arihant compound parisar main biaiji kapadaa factory or iske kai godaam the
 The building collapsed on Wednesday, taking the death toll to six
 haadase main 24 log ghayal hue hai
 Two of the three bodies recovered later have been identified as Mohammad Mansoor and Miraj Sheikh
 donon hi biaiji kapadaa factory main kaam karte the
 Narpoli Police Inspector DB Patil said that the police have registered a case of Section 304 (culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code against six persons for the building collapse
 unhone bataaya ki praathmiki main factory ke maalik dedhiya bros or imaarat ke architect tathaa nirmaataa ke naam shaamil hai
 However, no arrests have been made so far in connection with the accident
 aam aadmi party ke siyaasi ghamaasan main taaja shikaar mantri kapil mishra hue hai
 His leave from the ministerial position may be surprising for the party workers but it is not shocking news for many political pundits
 ek najar un vajahon par jo mishra par is karrwai ke peeche rahi ho sakati hai
 'faith' bruises on Kumar? Kapil Mishra, who was sworn in Sanskrit after victory in the assembly elections, is counted among the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party who are inclined towards the right
 khud kumaar vishwaas kaa shumaar bhi isi qatari ke netaaon main hota he
 This is not the only indication of closeness between the two leaders
 vidhansabha chunaavon main mili haar ke baad kumaar vishwaas ne apni hi party ke khilaaf sawaalon bharaa video jari kiya to kapil mishra unke samarthan main utarane vaale party ke sabase pehle netaaon main se ek the
 His claim was that what Kumar Vishwas is saying, in fact, Kejriwal also believes
 bade badlaavon kii himaayat kii sajaa?kapil mishra ne party ke bheetar emsidi chunaav main haar kii jimmedaari tay karne ke maamle main bhi kumaar vishwaas ke saath sur main sur milaae the
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he claimed that all the mlas, ministers and workers of the Aam Aadmi Party want a complete change in the party
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki haar ke liye jimmedaar netaaon ko ghar baithna chahie
 Apparently in this statement, he was referring to the leaders who are currently in command of the party
 itnaa hi nahin, kapil mishra ne kaha tha ki kumaar vishwaas se punjab or dilli main prachaar naa karwaane kii vajahon kii bhi samiksha kii jaaegi
 The balance of the two factions? Recently, Amanatullah Khan, a party MLA from Jamianagar, accused Kumar Vishwas of conspiring to break up the party with the BJP
 isse bhadke kumaar vishwaas ne party netaaon ke saamne naaraazgi jaahir karne main koi kotahi nahin barti
 As a result, a decree was issued to suspend Amanatullah from the party
 lekin saath hi party ne ek muslim chehre ke khilaaf karrwai se hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kii phikr bhi shuru kar di
 This was the reason that after suspension, Amanatullah was given a place in 7 committees of the Legislative Assembly, while the stature of several mlas considered close to the faith was reduced
 ho saktaa he ki kapil mishra ke khilaaf karrwai bhi kejariwal kii santulan kii isi siyasat kaa hissaa ho
 The electoral movement is fast, in such a situation leaders are seen adopting many ways to help the voters

 Promoting local leaders too, the party has decided to make local and state level leaders like Ravinder Kaur Bhattal, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Santok Singh, its star campaigners, besides Sonia and Rahul

 30 may ko narendra modi ne piem pad kii shapath lee thi
 From this day onwards, the politics of Bihar started eating
 badalte ghatnakram ab sandesh de rahe hai ki bihar main raajnneetik uthapatak abhi jari rahane vaala he
 Former Bihar CM Rabri Devi has said that if Nitish Kumar thinks of joining the Grand Alliance, he will have no objection
 rabari kaa ye sandesh us nitish kumaar ke liye he jinaki party ke netaa 30 may ko narendra modi mantrimandal main shaamil hone kii taiyaari kar chuke the, lekin mantrimandal main maatr ek seat milane par nitish kumaar ne amit shah ke is ofer ko thukraa or chupchaap patna laut gaye
 After this, when Nitish expanded his cabinet on June 2, BJP stayed out of it
 is raajnneetik paridrishy main argedy netaa rabari dwaara ye kahana ki agar jediu mahagathbandhan main aane kii pahal karata he to mahagathbandhan is par vichaar karegaa
 RJD is the largest constituent party of JDU in Bihar, hence Rabri's statement is important
 bataa den ki hindustani avam morcha ke pramukh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi dwaara somvaar ko patna main di gai iftaar party main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi shaamil hue the
 However, the two could not be met
 rabari devi dwaara nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa nyauta dene se hamen bihar ke purv dipti siem or rabari ke putr tejasvi yadav kaa wo bayaan yaad aata he jab loksabhaa chunaav se pehle tejasvi kaha karte the ki nitish ke mahagathbandhan main aane ke sabhi raste band ho gaye hai
 So has Tejashwi Yadav and RJD forgotten the insult of Nitish Kumar in 2017, when Nitish Kumar became CM again with the BJP by cheating Lalu Yadav in just 24 hours? The answer to this question is hidden in the mandate of 2019
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle argedy ne daawa kiya tha ki nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag hone ke maatr 6 maheene baad hi dobaaraa mahagathbandhan main waapas aana chaahate the, lekin iske liye lalu yadav or tejasvi yadav taiyaar nahin hue
 In June 2018, Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar's credibility has not survived
 agar maan bhi liya jaae ki ham phir se nitish ko gathbandhan main le lete hai to is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki ve kuch samay baad hamen dhokhaa nahin denge
 The doors are closed for them
 " tejasvi yadav nitish ko kai palatu ram or palatu chachaa kah chuke hai
 After all, why is RJD ready to take Nitish once again in the grand alliance
 darasal argedy narendra modi sarkaar se nitish ke man main paidaa hue asantosh ko bhunaanaa chaahati he, argedy ko lagata he ki nitish kii naav par savaar hokar party ko ek baar phir bihar kii satta mil sakati he
 Nitish Kumar also knows that he is neither in a position to make any deal with the central government for the next five years nor can he pressurize and get his demands done
 lihaaja agar 2020 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ve ek baar phir se argedy ke saath aa jaaen to agle paanch saal tak ve ek baar phir se siem ban sakate hai
 Nitish Kumar knows that his staying with RJD will be a more effective political equation for him than Amit Shah
 argedy ke upaadhyaksh raghuvansh prasad singh ne bhi isse pehle bijepi ko pachhaadne ke liye sabhi dalon ko ek saath aane kii apil kii thi
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had named Nitish Kumar, "the policy says that everyone should come together to beat the BJP, it should be sorted somewhere and there should be no need to choose
" "raghuvansh prasad ko jab tejasvi kaa wo bayaan yaad dilaayaa gaya jisamen unhone kaha ki 'nitish ke liye mahagathbandhan main sabhi raste band ho chuke hai' to raghuvansh prasad singh ne kaha ki "kahin koi likhakar diya he, yah samay kii baat he
 "however, Tejashwi Yadav has not yet responded to the invitation to Nitish
 congress party ne banaras kii loksabhaa seat se party ke vartmaan vidhayak ajay raay ko bhartiya janata party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utaara he
 Rai will also compete with Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party on this seat
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne ajay raay kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa karte hue samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'ajay raay jameen se jude kaaryakarta or netaa hai
 He is a Congress MLA in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 unhone anekon baar varanasi kii bhoomi par raajnneetik jang ladi he or jiti bhi he or vah varanasi main shreshth ummidavaar honge
 He said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi has taken this decision after extensive consideration
 gauratlab he ki party ne pehle kai maukon par kaha tha ki modi ke khilaaf ek majboot ummidavaar ko utaara jayega
 About a week ago, at a function organized to issue the party's manifesto, the Congress president said that the party would definitely challenge Modi in Varanasi
 surajevaala ne kaha ki ki ajay raay varanasi main janata kii samasyaon se acchhee tarah waakif hai or vah behatar dhang se janata kaa netritv kar paaenge
 We do not expect to believe that he will be victorious in this war of ideology
 unhone is baat ko bhi galat bataaya ki congress ne varanasi main isliye kamjor ummidavaar utaara taaki bijepi raibareli main sonia gandhi ke khilaaf majboot ummidavaar na utaare
 The Congress spokesperson also appealed to all non-bjp parties to support Ajay Rai's candidature
 dilli par dhundh kii chadar chhaayi hui he or ye haal vaayu pradooshan kii vajah se he
 In such a situation, politics has also started under the garb of this pollution, because the Delhi government is making big claims of pollution prevention, but the central government has now started to blame the Delhi government for this white emergency
 dilli main pradooshan kii vikat sthiti ke liye kendriya mantri vijay goyal ne kejariwal sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Goyal has said that there was never such a situation in Delhi, Delhi is known for its greenery, but today people are afraid of coming to Delhi, even in Delhi it has become difficult for people to breathe
 vijay goyal ne is puure halaat ke liye dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke sir par thikra phod diya he
 He said that such situations are happening every year in Delhi, but the government does not take any action and when the crisis is on the head, there is a lot of anger, this is why Delhi's health is deteriorating
 mantri vijay goyal khud mask lagaaye hue nazar aae, unke mutabik conot place jaisi jagah par aap bina mask ke khadey nahin ho sakate
 The eyes are jealous, but the government is not bothered about this, Kejriwal is only involved in allegations and counter-allegations
 goyal ke mutabik centre sarkaar unka sahyog karne ke liye hameshaa taiyaar he, jab pehali baar aad evan lagu kiya gaya tha, tab unhon kejariwal kaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin duusari baar aad evan main unhone virodh kiya
 According to Goyal, the government wants to save its hand by making a ruckus
 dilli main pichley do dinon se hawa kii haalat kharaab he or pradooshan behad khatarnaak str tak pahunch gaya he
 In such a situation, when people are looking for ways to avoid danger and are scared, then the fog of politics is also heavy on this mist
 desh main abhi 462 power plants hai
 They are supplying 274,980 MW of electricity to the entire country
 haalanki ab bhi desh main kharaab vitaran pranali or dekharekh ke abhaav main kai gharon ko bijli nahin mil paa rahi he
 But a total of 98 power plants are being constructed in the country right now
 iske alaava 30 plants or banane kii taiyaari he, lekin iske liye vibhinn prakaar ke clearence kii zarurat he
 An additional 77,030 to the country on completion of the 98 power plants being constructed
 65 megawatt bijli milegi
 There will be no light in any part of the country
 rajyasabha main urja mantralay ke rajyamantri swatantra prabhaar aarake singh ne rajyasabha main bataaya ki desh ke vibhinn rajyon main abhi 12034 megawatt kshamta ke 36 hydro-electric power plant banaae ja rahe hai
 Apart from these, thermal power plants are being built at 62 places
 inke banane ke baad desh ko atirikt 77,030
 65 MW power will be available
 mantri aarake singh ne bataaya ki 23424 megawatt kshamta ke 30 nae power plants bhi banane hai lekin inamen se kisi kaa paryaavarniya to kisi kaa forest clearence baaki he
 After all these, the country will get a total of 128 new power plants and the country will get 100,454
 65 megawatt atirikt bijli milegi
 India is still not able to become a power-surplus country, so much electricity is not being produced in the country that it can be placed in the power-surplus country category
 pichley vitt varsh kii baat karen to peak aavar main bijli kii supplai 0

 8%) bijli kam rahi
 There was a demand of 1,274 billion units throughout the year, while only 1,267 billion units were supplied
 yani 735 karod unit (0
 6%) was recorded
 bijli na milane kaa sabase bada kaaranh grid main bijli, ghar main andhera?aapke ghar tak bijli na pahunchane kaa kaaran desh main bijli kii kami katai nahin he
 The current power generation capacity in the country is adequate
 aapke gharon main bijli na pahunch paane ke peeche vajah darasal khastahal buniyadi dhaancha or karj main laden rajya ke vidyut vibhaag hai, jo aarthik tangi ke chalate jarurat ke mutabik bijli kharid nahin pate or na hi buniyadi dhaanche par apekshit kharch kar pate hai

 Hi
 
 i am Ravish Kumar! Ask yourself this question, whether you are secular or not? Whether it is necessary or not
 kya secular hona ek saamaanya naagarik aacharan he, jiske tahat ham or aap ek duusare kii manyataon, aasthaaon kii simaaon kaa aadar karte hai? kya satta badalane se secular hone kii koi samaj badal jaati he? kya yah chunaav secular hone ke buniyadi soch ko prabhavit karata he yaa secular hone yaa dikhne ke liye naatakeey harkaton ko riject karata he? It is important to look into this question, because if someone refused to wear a hat, was he not happy with a particular community by doing so
 topi na pahananaa tushtikaran kaa asweekaar tha yaa dhruvikaran kaa angikaar
 Then why did Rajnath Singh wear a hat? Then Narendra Modi wears a cap or angavastram for different communities and religions in different states, so does it create any alternative definition of secularism or the already political way of communicating to different sections 
 saath main yah bhi sochiye ki sonia gandhi jab topi pahane kisi dharmik netaa se milti hai to kya vah secularism kii ghisipity samaj se bahusankhyak ko chidhaa rahi thim yaa vot lene ke liye raajnneetik jugad kar rahi thim
 Were the two emblematic leaders of current Indian politics claiming different definitions of secularism by not wearing a hat or meeting the leader of the cap, or were both doing the same thing in different clothes
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki is bahes kaa makasad kya he? sampradayikta banaam secularism kii bhidnt ke naam par ek sampradaay ke prati apni nafrat ko sahi tehraana yaa apane bheetar kii nafrat se ubar ek duusare ke prati sahishnu bananaa
 On 26 May, the Hindu sociologist Shivvishwanath wrote an article
 secular kattar soch par sawaal karne vaale us lekh kii shuruyaat main shiv vishvanathan kehete hai ki jab ve tivi par vishwanath mandir jate or ganga aarti karte narendra modi ko dekhte hai to ve sochane par majaboor ho jate hai ki modi kaa sandesh yah he ki hamen apane dharm par sharminda hone kii zarurat nahin he
 This could not have happened before
 aisa sochate vakt shiv vishvanathan jaise samajashastri chhath se lekar kumbh ke maukey par un tasveeron ko bhul jate hai, jab mulaayam singh yadav ganga main dubkee lagaate hai, sonia gandhi dubkee lagaati hai or lalu prasad yadav live camaron ke saamne do dashak se chhath manaa rahe hai
 Does such astronomical knowledge relate only to political defeat and victory
 iskaa zikr isliye bhi kiya ki eke antni se pehle 26 may ko da hindu main chape shiv vishvanathan ke lekh ne kaaphi khalabali machaai, jise lekar ravi singh or aditya nigam ne kafila
 Wrote academic articles on ORG
 congress netaa eke antni ne to aisi baat kahi he jo kai logon ko thik lagi he, magar dhyaan se dekhenge to antni kii yah baat aane vaale samay main us khatarnaak soch ko or manyata detii he, jiske khilaaf ve apni baat kah rahe hai
 AK Antony said that despite following a policy of equal justice for all, there has been doubt about some sections of the society regarding the Congress that the party is more inclined towards some particular community or organization
 riginal chrishchiyan party or indian muslim lig kaa mahatv sarkaar main badhata ja rahaa he, jisase yah dharna bani ki kerala main congress sarkaar ko alpsankhyak chalaa rahe hai
 After the election, Digvijay Singh also said in an interview to Economic Times that a large section of Hindus felt that they were getting less
 unhen ek hokar sabhi secular dalon ko haraa dena chahie
 Even the word secular means Muslim appeasement
 kya tushtikaran sirf alpsankhyak saapeksh hota he
 But it should not be so relative that every absolute thing starts to look communal
 jaise aap kerala ke un netaaon ko nahin samajha sakate ki class room main kaale rang kaa board hataa kar hare rang kaa board laga dena, islamickaran nahin he
 Is the Green Board opposing because the Union Minister for Education is of the Indian Union Muslim League? somvaar ke hindu akhbaar main he ki sipiem ke netaa pi vijayan kah rahe hai ki centre main bijepi shiksha kaa bhagavakaran kar rahi he, to kerala main indian muslim lig ise haraa kar rahi he
 Many Congress leaders have also opposed the Green Board
 desh hi nahin duniya bhar ke skulon main vaigyanik kaarnon se hare rang kaa board lagaaya ja rahaa he
 This board will also be set up in BJP ruled states
 aisi bahason main aap darshakon kii shithilataa kaa khatarnaak istemaal na ho iske liye zaruri he ki ek baar apane class room ke green board ko yaad kar lijiega
 Whether the Green Boards were imposed for the purpose of Islamization
 na samaj aae to in do rangon kii phooti kismat par sar phod lijiega or tab bhi na samaj aae to tivi band kar bhaag jaaiega
 a separate election should be held in this country with the understanding of being secular
 vaise aap darshak behatar jaanate honge ki kya isi aadhaar par vot kiya yaa kai kaarnon main se ek kaaran yah bhi tha
 Whoever celebrates the celebrations, but what is less important is not celebrating the victory of communalism
 secularism ke hi kisi anya rup kaa man rahaa he
 This is the biggest victory of being secular
 aapako kahana padataa he ki secular hone kaa hamaara paimaana sahi he
 After AK Antony's statement, LK Advani said in the class of bjp's first-time mps on Sunday that the bjp's decisive victory has not only changed the political landscape of the country, but has also influenced political debate in the opposition camp
 
 adwani ne kaha ki 'kuch hi din pehle varisht congress netaa eke antni ne kaha he ki congress ko secularism par apni nitiyon or unke paalan par aatmamanthan karnaa chahie
 We should welcome this honest self-belief, because he is now saying the same thing that BJP has always been saying
 kya ham dharmanirpekshata kii kisi nai samaj kii ore agrasar ho rahe hai, jahaan dharmanirpekshata ke matlab se pratinidhitiv kaa sawaal to gaayab ho jayega? magar alpsankhyak cote kaa mantripad jarur rahegaa, kyonki kisi ek ko mantri bananaa he
 Whose secularism won and whose lost? What is the one who won and what was the one who lost? maharashtra main maratha aarakshan ko lekar rajya kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar ne bada kadam uthaaya he
 In fact, on Sunday, the Fadnavis cabinet approved the bill for Maratha reservation
 iske saath hi ab rajya main maratha aarakshan kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Giving information about the decision of the cabinet, CM Devendra Fadnavis said that it has been agreed to give reservation to Maratha society
 siem fadanvis ne media se baatcheet karte hue kaha, 'hamen pichhadaa varg ayog kii report mili thi, jisamen teen siforishein kii gai hai

 hamane pichhadaa varg ayog kii siforeeshon ko sweekaar kar liya he or in par amal ke liye ek cabinet sab kamity banaai gai he
 'we received Backward Class Commission report with 3 recommendations

 Further action is being taken in the case
 maa ko kandhaa dene vaali pushpawati kaa kahana he ki maine sirf apni maa kii antim ichha kaa sammaan kiya he

 a lot of bizarre is happening in Patna city
 shahar main ek hafte main centre, rajya or anya agenncy milakar bhi barish ke jamaa pani nikaal nahin paye hai
 You will be surprised to know that neither Patna Municipal Corporation nor the agency given the task of draining the water has any map of the city drains
 had to tab ho gai shahar ke rakh rakhaav or baahar se pani kii nikasi kaise ho jiskaa zimmaa jin logon ke upar tha ve hi ab akramak tareeke se doshiyon ke kilaaf karrwai ho raag ched diya he
 Meaning you are right, who is the leader of BJP, especially the newly appointed President of Bihar BJP, Sanjay Jaiswal Patna, Mayor Sita Sahu is now demanding that action should be taken against the culprits when they know that most of the culprits are none other than their own ministers mlas and Mayor Who did not perform their work and responsibilities properly
 lekin jaanch hogi, zarur hogi kyonki netaaon ko apane aap ko bachaana hai to chote adhikariyon kii bali zarur chadhaai jaaegi
 But the people of Patna, especially those trapped in the water, have no doubt that they did not drown due to water, but because of the nexus of leaders, officials and officials, they are facing trouble and economic loss and disease
 patna ke logon kaa dard shaayad koi samaj nahin saktaa
 But this time he has no doubt in his mind who is the villain of this water logging
 haalanki ek sachai se nyaay vyavastha bhi munh nahin mode sakati he
 When the High Court stopped monitoring, all agencies sat with folded hands
 jiske kaaran patna ke lakhon logon ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa duusari baat yah thi ki shahar main jab bhi atikaraman yaa naalon ke nirmaan karne vaali agenciyaan shithil yaa ghatiya kaam kiya to hoicourt se unhen sajaa nahin mili uskaa ek bada kaaran rajya sarkaar dwaara in maamalon kii court ke saamne sahi tareeqe se sthiti kii bayaan karne main vifaltaa rahi he
 People believe that only the Patna High Court can liberate people from Nikkem officials and arrogant politicians and it will have to come back into active role once again

 com / 9pmpiindkf Former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor received a lot of criticism for his tweet after the 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon was hanged
 is bich ravivaar ko tharur ne aatankwaadiyon ke liye bhi mrityudand kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki shashan ko hatyaron kii tarah bartaav nahin karnaa chahie
 He says that there is considerable scope for errors and bias in the crime justice system
 congress saansad ne kaha, 'aatankwaadiyon ko bina parole ke puri jindagi ke liye salaakhon ke peeche daal diya janaa chahie
 In the early days, it was believed that if a person kills someone, he should also be killed
 hamen kyon is puraani aprachlit pratha kaa paalan karne kii jarurat he
 
 
 ' tiruvanantpuram main ek kaarykram ke maukey par unhone kaha, 'jab ham mrityudand ko taamil karte hai to ham vaaki unheen kii tarah bartaav karte hai
 They are murderers and the state (regime) should not behave like them
 ' mumbai ke 1993 ke bam visphot ke mujrim yaqub memon ko faansee dene ke sambandh main unke dwaara kiye gaye twit par uthe vivaad par unhone kaha, 'maine memon maamle par ek shabd tak nahin kaha
 Actually, in the tweet i had, i was not going into the merits of the personal matter and it was the responsibility of the Supreme Court
 maine mrityudand ke viruddh twit kiya tha, jo ek puraani or aprachlit pratha he
 ' sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv baan kii moon ne bhi kaha tha ki hamen kisi kii jindagi lene kaa haq nahin he
 Tharoor said that not only he but Sitaram Yechury, d
 raja, kanimoi, shatrughna sinha or varun gandhi sahit kai netaaon ne bhi mrityudand samaapt karne kaa samarthan kiya
 The Congress leader said, "143 countries have already abolished the death penalty and 25 other countries are not implementing it, while the death penalty is in their law
" philhal keval 35 desh ise amal main laa rahe hai
 Why should our country follow such a practice
 ' Tharoor had come under the bjp's target when he said recently that he was deeply disappointed by the news that our government hanged a human being
 rajya pryojit hatya ham sabhi ko hatyare kii shrenee main pahunchaa detii he
 In an article on the issue, Tharoor said that there is no statistical correlation between the death penalty and killing
 1980-90 ke bich kareeb das log bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 ke tahat hatya ke jurm main faansee par chadha die gaye, lekin is avadhi main hatya kii ghatnaayen 22,149 se badhkar 35,045 ho gayin
 He further writes that during 1999-2000, eight people were hanged, but the incidence of murder increased from 35,045 to 37,399
 saal 2000-2010 ke dauraan keval ek vyakti ko faansee par latakaaya gaya or hatya kii ghatnaayen 37999 se ghatakar 33,335 hui
 Tharoor said that the vague use of the 'rarest of cases' doctrine by the Supreme Court does not make a person understand which crime can carry the death penalty or life imprisonment
 congress saansad ne daleel di ki kanoonee pratinidhitiv kii gunvattta evam aropiyon kii aarthik haisiyat par gaur kiya janaa chahie kyonki dhani aparaadhiyon kii tulana main garib aparaadhiyon ko zyada faansee di gai he
 He said that statements such as 'the collective conscience of the community remained stunned' to justify the death penalty leave little room for subjectivity and there is also the risk that a decision by the media without correct information may affect the decision 
 tippaniyan Tharoor said that the current criminal justice system leaves a lot of room for errors and favoritism
 aisi sambhaavna he ki jaanch agency paryaapt or praasangik saboot juta nahin sake, vakil apane maamle kaa sahi moolyankan karne or uskaa bachaav karne main aksham ho tathaa aise main nyaayadhish vyaktigat purvagrahon evam media report ke prabhaav main aa jaaen
 The Congress leader said that during 2010-13, the lower court pronounced 436 death sentences, but 280 of them were commuted to life sentences and only two were hanged
 unhone kaha ki yah pataa lagane ke liye koi samgr maapdand nahin he ki kisi vyakti ko faansee par chadhaakar bilkul sahi kiya gaya he, naitik rup se aise ativaadee kadam uthaane ko sahi tehraana mushkil he
 The Congress MP said, 'terrorists should be put behind bars for whole life without parole
 praarambhik dinon main aisi manyata thi ki yadi koi vyakti kisi kii hatya karata he to use bhi maar diya janaa chahie
 Why do we need to follow this old obsolete practice
 
 
 ' On the occasion of a program in Thiruvananthapuram, he said, 'when we serve the death penalty, we really behave like them
 ve hatyare hai or rajya (shashan) ko unki tarah bartaav nahin karnaa chahie
 "I did not say a word on the Memon case," he said on the controversy over the tweet made by him in relation to the execution of the 1993 Mumbai bomb blast convict Yakub Memon 
 darasal maine jo twit kiya tha, usamen main vyaktigat maamle ke gun-dosha main nahin ja rahaa tha or yah supreme court kii jimmedaari thi
 i tweeted against the death penalty, which is an old and obsolete practice
 ' UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon also said that we have no right to take anyone's life
 tharur ne kaha ki na keval unhone balki seetaram yechuri, di
 Several leaders including Raja, Kanimozhi, Shatrughan Sinha and Varun Gandhi also supported the abolition of capital punishment
 congress netaa ne kaha, '143 desh pehle hi mrityudand khatm kar chuke hai or 25 anya desh is par amal nahin kar rahe hai, jabaki mrityudand unke kanoon main he
 At present, only 35 countries are implementing it
 hamaare desh ko kyon aisi pratha kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 ' tharur tab bijepi ke nishane par aa gaye the jab unhone haal hi main kaha tha ki is khabar se unhen badi niraashaa hui ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko faansee par lataka diya
 State-sponsored assassination puts us all in the category of murderer
 is mudde par apane ek aalekh main tharur ne kaha ki mrityudand dene or hatya rokane ke bich koi sankhyikee sah-sambandh nahin he
 Between 1980-90, about ten people were hanged under the section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for murder, but the incidence of murder increased from 22,149 to 35,045 during this period
 unhone aage likhaa he ki isi tarah 1999-2000 ke dauraan aath logon ko faansee di gai, lekin hatya kii ghatnaayen 35,045 se badhaakar 37,399 ho gai
 During the years 2000–2010, only one person was hanged and the incidence of murder decreased from 37999 to 33,335
 tharur ne kaha ki supreme court dwaara 'durlabhtam' maamle siddhant ke aspasht istemaal se vyakti samaj nahin paata ki kis aparaadh main mrityudand ho sakati he yaa umrakaid
 The Congress MP argued that the quality of legal representation and the economic status of the accused should be taken into consideration as poor criminals are hanged more than rich criminals
 unhone kaha ki mrityudand ko sahi tehraane ke liye 'samudaay kaa samuhik vivek stabdh rah gaya' jaise kathan vyaktiparakta kii gujainsh chhodte hai or saath hi yah jokhim bhi hota he ki bina sahi jaankaree ke media dwaara raag alaape jane se nirnay par asar pad saktaa he
 The comments tharur ne kaha ki vartmaan aparaadh nyaay pranali trutiyaan or pakshpaat ke liye bahut gujainsh chhodti he
 There is a possibility that the investigating agency may not be able to gather sufficient and relevant evidence, the lawyer is unable to properly evaluate and defend his case and the judges may come under the influence of personal bias and media reports
 congress netaa ne kaha ki 2010-13 ke dauraan nichali adaalat ne 436 mrityudand ke faisle sunaae, lekin unamem se 280 umrakaid ke faisle main badal die gaye or keval do ko faansee par chadhaaya gaya
 He said that there is no overall criterion to ascertain whether a person has been exactly executed by hanging, it is difficult to justify taking such extreme steps morally
