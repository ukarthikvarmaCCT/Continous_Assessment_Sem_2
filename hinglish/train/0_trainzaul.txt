 "yes, i feel lonely," says Rabri
 koun patni apane pati ke jail jane par khush rah sakati he? agar nitish kumaar or unki team ko lagata he ki ve party tod denge to yah unki bevakoofi he
 We have become stronger than ever

 ”rabari bataati hai ki unke vaivaahik jivan kii shuruyaat ke samay bhi unke pati nyaayik hiraasat main hi the
 Born in 1959, Rabri was married to Lalu Yadav in 1973 at the age of 14 and Gowana three years later
 lekin isi bich immergency ke khilaaf chaatr andolan ke dauraan 1974 se 1977 ke darmyaan lalu kai baar giraftaar hue or jail gaye
 Says Rabri, "that's what I've seen in my entire life
 chaara ghotaale ke maamalon main sahab ko kisi na kisi bahaane jail main band kar diya jaataa tha
 i had to take care of my young children, who did not even know what prison is or why their father does not live with them
 mujhe sarkaar or parivaar donon kii dekhbhaal kerani thi
 i have done all this alone
 mere bachche ab bade ho gaye hai or ve apana khyaal rakh sakate hai
 Apart from this, they also help me in the affairs of the party
 ab main apana puraa dhyaan party par laga sakati hum or argedy ke netaaon sang unke rajnatik sangharsh main haath banta sakati hum
 Bravery is reflected in Rabri Devi's words
 lekin lalu ke bagaiyr jivan is samay bahut mushkil lag rahaa he
 The times have changed — when Lalu went to jail for 35 days in December 2001, time has become a bit worse than that
 us dauraan sthiti puri tarah kaabo main thi, rabari devi bihar kii mukhyamantri thim or bihar lalu kii jaagir
 On 30 September, Lalu was convicted in the fodder scam case
 usase pehle july, 1997 se disambar, 2001 tak unhen chah baar nyaayik hiraasat main bheja ja chukaa tha
 During that time Rabri Devi was the Chief Minister of Bihar, but she never went to jail to see her honor
 party ke logon kaa kahana he ki ve unhen aisi haalat main nahin dekh saktin
 More than a decade after Lalu's last jail visit, Rabri Devi is facing many challenges today, the biggest challenge being to keep her presence in Bihar relevant after Lalu was imprisoned, as compared to the past The current situation is that Lalu has lost his eligibility to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections due to his conviction in court
 lalu ko sajaa hone ke turant baad varisht jedy (you) mantri narendra singh ne 'achche argedy netaaon’ ko nitish kii party main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya tha, jise argedy ke hataash netaaon ko todgaye kii nitish kii kathith ranneeti ke taur par dekha gaya
 Says Rabri, "I know Nitish is doing all this
" ve hi hamaari party ko todgaye kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Whenever they come in front of me in the Legislative Council, they are unable to meet my eyes
 ek samay tha jab ve sahab kii baaten sunne ke liye hamaare ghar main der raat 2 baje tak baithe rahete
 Today when Laluji is in jail, he is trying to ruin us
 ”party ko bheetar or baahar se chunautirabadi kii chintaa kii vajah sirf nitish nahin, un par apni party ko ekajute rakhane kaa bhi bhaar he jisamen teen loksabhaa saansad aise hai jo lalu ke uttaradhikari tejasvi yadav ke janm se pehle se janpratinidhi bane hue hai
 This is a difficult situation
 jahaan lalu ayogy hone kii vajah se chunaav nahin lard sakate hai, vahiin sambhaavna he ki argedy ke kai varisht netaa 24 varshiya tejasvi ko apana sheersh netaa maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin honge
 For this reason, Rabri's political role has become even more important
 lalu kii jindagi main rabari ne kai role adaa kiye hai
 The most dramatic scene in India's political legacy was seen on the day when Rabri Devi, the mother of nine children, was appointed the Chief Minister of Bihar on 25 July 1997
 ve shaayad akeli mukhyamantri hai jo ankhon main aansu bhare shapath samaaroh main pahunchin
 Lalu Prasad was forced to step down as chief minister following a chargesheet filed by the CBI in the fodder scam case
 rajnatik halkon main puri tarah anjaan rabari devi ko bihar ke mukhyamantri ke pad par bitha diya gaya
 Although the RJD again won the assembly elections in 2000, Lalu Prasad retained Rabri as the chief minister
 30 sitambar ko ranchi kii sibiai adaalat se sajaa paane ke baad lalu prasad ne ek baar phir badi saavdhaanee se apane pattey khele hai
 There was speculation that he would appoint Rabri as his successor, but Lalu avoided taking any such step and supported the idea of collective leadership put forward by other senior leaders of the party
 sambhav he ki lalu ke jail main band hone se argedy samuhik netritv kaa koi formula ijad kare, lekin nattejey kii jimmedaari saaf taur par rabari ko uthaani hogi
 Rabri has served as the Chief Minister of Bihar for much longer than her husband
 aaj phir apane pati ke kehane par jimmedaari uthaane ke liye badhate rabari ke kadamon main jhijak yaa anichhaa nahin dikhti jo 1997 main mukhyamantri banaae jane par jhalki thi
 rabri-rathrabadi started touring the state from November 18 and conducted rjd's Parivartan Yatra in dozens of districts of Bihar
 rabari kii saarvajanik sabhaaon ne jis tarah kii bheed aakarshith kii he vah unke virodhiyon kii neend udaane ke liye kaaphi he
 His convoy headed towards Paliganj when he passed through Fulwari Sharif, a Muslim-dominated area of patna, and was welcomed by the crowd with flower garlands chanting slogans in favor of Lalu Prasad
 saaf he ki lalu ko sajaa ke baad bhi bihar ke musalamaanon ne unki party nahin chodi he
 It is different whether Lalu has taken any inspiration from his wife or not, but in the event of crisis, he has always resorted to Rabri and has also taken advantage of its positive results
 argedy hameshaa se lalu prasad kii party rahi he, lekin chaara ghotaalaa maamle main july, 1997 main lalu ke jail jane ke samay se kaman rabari ne tham lee or apni party or sarkaar ko apane do bhaaiyon, sadhu yadav or subhash sahit kai anya mahatvakankshi netaaon se surakshit or pahunch se pare rakhaa
 Today, when Lalu has been disqualified as a Lok Sabha MP due to his conviction, Rabri is once again overseeing the party on his behalf
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haarane ke baad rabari ek tarah se ritair ho gai thim, lekin lalu ne may, 2012 ko unhen vidhaan parishad ke sadsy ke rup main namankit kar raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main waapas khinch liya
 According to RJD insiders, this was a well thought out strategy designed keeping in mind the fodder scam case
 sahanubhuti kii lahar jagaanaa koi aasaan kaam nahin
 a senior RJD leader says, "as long as our supporters are concerned about Lalu, RJD will benefit from it
" lekin agar hamaare samarthak lalu ke liye dukhi hone lagen to yah sthiti hamaare khilaaf ja sakati he, kyonki tab ve hamaare sabase bade chunavi dushman nitish kumaar ko sajaa dene ke liye narendra modi kii bijepi ke saath haath mila sakate hai
 The frustration among our supporters after Lalu's bail plea from the Jharkhand High Court was rejected
 aise main rabari ke sanchaalan main ho rahi parivartan yatra hamaare samarthakon kaa dhyaan kendrit rakhane main ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahi he
 Rabri has shown political maturity in Lalu's absence
 jaise hi narendra modi ne argedy ke muslim-yadav vot bank ko lubhaane kii koshish kii, rabari ne turant morcha khol diya
 On October 27, Modi, at his Hunkaar rally in Patna, tried to put the Yadavs in his court, citing an incident related to the Mahabharata
 jo bihar main lalu ke sabase adhik patibaddh vot bank ke rup main pahachaane jate hai
 Calling him a descendant of Krishna, Narendra Modi promised to take care of him and said that he came from the Dwarka that Krishna had built his karmabhoomi after Mathura
 agle din rabari lagbhag 100 burqadhari mahilaon or yadav netaaon ke saath dikhin
 There the entrance was open for photographers and Rabri was chatting with Muslim women
 lalu kii gaiyrhaaziri main argedy ke paramparaagat yadav or muslim vot bank ko apni ore khinchne kii modi kii saaf koshishon se ashankit rabari ne naap-taul kar gujarat ke mukhyamantri par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the riots in Gujarat and after that Modi did not get the attention of Yadavs and Muslims
 muslim-yadav ke saamaajik sameekaran kii vajah se hi lalu ne 15 saal tak rajya main shashan kiya
 Both these groups constitute 30 percent of the total population of the state
 bijepi kii yadavon par najaranarendra modi or nitish kumaar puri shiddat se koshish kar rahe hai ki loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle argedy ke is paramparaagat vot bank ko apane paale main le aayaa jaae
 While Narendra Modi's focus is on the Yadav vote bank, Nitish wants to pull Muslims from Rabri's court
 rabari apane andaaj main donon par nishaanaa sadhti hai, ''laalkrishna adwani ne jab bihar main apane sampradayik agenda ko majboot karne kii koshish kii to laluji ne unhen giraftaar kar liya
 Nitish, who has only spoken for secularism and minorities, called Narendra Modi twice as a state guest on whom the minorities can never trust
 ”argedy ke netaa maanate hai ki modi ke mudde par bijepi se naata todakar nitish ne musalamaanon ke ek varg kaa samarthan to paa hi liya he, lekin unhen bharosa he ki iske baad bhi alpsankhyak lalu ke ummidavaar ko hi vot karenge kyonki bijepi ko haraane kii kuwwat argedy main kahin zyada he
 According to a top RJD leader, "muslims always vote for the candidate who has the quibble of defeating the BJP
" 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2010 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main jarur alag rukh dekhne ko mila jab nitish kii vajah se kuch musalamaanon ne endie ke paksh main vot daale
 Now that Narendra Modi has become the bjp's biggest leader, the Muslims will return to their basic strategy and vote for the RJD as 'yadav', the single largest ethnic community in Bihar, stands firmly with Lalu after being convicted
 It is done
 ”kya chalegi sahanubhuti lahar?rabari kii reliyon main saje bannron main anivaary taur par rabari ko chhath puja karte or lalu ko salaakhon ke peeche dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Apparently, it aims to generate a sympathy wave
 saath hi jis andaaj main rabari janasamudaay kii ankhon main ankhen daalkar unhen sambodhit karti hai, uskaa sidhaa sanket yah he ki party har musiibat se ladgaye ke liye taiyaar he
 At rallies, Rabri often asks, "do you think that the voice of fighting for the backward, extremely backward classes, Dalits and minorities should be suppressed and jailed?" The crowd replies, "never
" 
 
 kabhi nahin
 "rabri tells people," Laluji is innocent
 ve hamaare pratidwandviyon kii rajnatik sajeesh kaa shikaar ho gaye hai
 The time has come for you to remain united and face the communal forces
 jedy (you) or bijepi main andar hi andar dosti he
 If you want to bring back the rule of the poor in the state, then you have to fight against these two
 ”kya karegi congresspatna ke akhbaar jab nitish-susheel modi ke jhagadon kii khabaron se pate pade hai, tab rabari chupchaap samarthakon se sampark saadhane main juty hai
 Sometimes she also opens her mind: "BJP is Ravan, then JD (U) Kansa
" donon ne milakar logon ko murkh banaaya or saat saal se zyada samay se bihar ko lut rahe hai
 "the RJD hopes that the Congress will eventually form an alliance with it
 rabari kahati hai, ''ve jarur dekh rahe honge ki laluji ke saath jo bartaav kiya ja rahaa he usase logon main kitna gussa he
 "rabri could not even complete her primary school education in her village Salarkala
 unki shaadi bahut kam umr main ho gai thi
 The journey from the time she took over as the female Chief Minister of Bihar (the lone Chief Minister of the state) to Bihar amidst the political turmoil that arose in 1997 must have been quite difficult for her
 mobile phone ek baar phir se bajataa he
 This is a phone call from someone who knows and the smile on their face falls apart

 Keeping the caller on hold, she tells Anwar to call her son Tej Pratap with a laptop so that they can help them in choosing the photos

 Sapna Chaudhary did a real miracle when she arrived at the 'bigg Boss' house
 'big bos 11' main sapana choudhary ne na sirf apane dance se darshakon kaa dil jeeta balki apane atitude se bhi unhone sabko fain banaaya
 Anyway, in 2018 Sapna Chaudhary's song 'teri Aankhya Ka Yo Kajal' changed the fate of Deep Brar
 deep ne is gane par dance kiya, ve duniyabar main femes ho gayi
 On 21 February, a unique thing happened: Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, grandson of his old rivals Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad's daughter Rajalakshmi, attended the tilak ceremony by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki pratidwandviyon ke paariwarik samarohon main bhaag lenaa dilli darbar ke liye aam baat he
 The truth is that this happens in all state capitals as well
 lekin bijepi par najar rakhane vaale puraane jaankaar kehete hai ki modi ke liye yah aam baat nahin thi
 However, the reason for Modi's visit to Mulayam Singh's stronghold Saifai is not difficult to understand
 sansad kaa bajet satr shuru hone main sirf do din baaki the
 In such a situation, the fate of all the Bills depends on the level of opposition unity in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is in the minority
 dar he ki yah satr bhi bahut kuch sheetakaaleen satr kii tarah hi na ho jaae, jisamen vipakshi saansadon ne rajyasabha ko uske nirdhaarit samay se sirf 59 pratishat samay kaam karne diya tha or pramukh vidheyakon ko atka diya tha
 In contrast, the Lok Sabha worked for 98 percent of its time listed, where the NDA has a vast majority
 isliye jaruri tha ki mulaayam singh ke saath sambandh madhur kiye jaaen, jinaki party ke upree sadan main 15 sadsy hai
 This is the new Modi
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri se bilkul alag, jo vipaksh ko kuchalakar rakh dete the, use sadan main is tarah cheekhney-chillane kaa mauka tak nahin dete the
 His government passed the Lokayukta Bill in October 2013, just a few months before the general election, in which the entire opposition was suspended for a day for disrupting the functioning of the House
 ye modi sheetakaaleen satr ke pradhanmantri se bhi alag hai, jinhone us samay tus se mas hone se inkaar kar diya tha, jab vipakshi saansadon ne anya muddon ke alaava punardharmantaran ke mudde par unke bayaan kii maang karte hue kaarywahi baadhit kii thi
 Initially, it seemed that after the historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections, Modi, having been consistently successful in the assembly elections, has brought with him a tough attitude like Gandhinagar in New Delhi
 modi vipaksh or apni party main bhi naak-bhun sicodne waalon ke liye pahunch ke baahar the
 His government had issued a number of ordinances soon after the end of the winter session, hinting at unfreezing the opposition's majority in the Rajya Sabha
 lekin lagata he ki is saal farvari main hue dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne tasviir ko badal diya he
 After a setback, the Modi government is trying to join hands with old Delhi-style consensus politics
 vahi tarika, jo sansad ke andar or baahar donon jagahon par, satta or vipaksh ke khandit rishton ko punarvyavasthit karne main aksar madadgaar sabit hota rahaa he
 It has been happening at least on paper
 yah baat 24 farvari ko hi spasht ho gai thi ki sarkaar kii yah ashanka bevajaah nahin thi
 When a day after President Pranab Mukherjee addressed a joint sitting of the House, the entire opposition — Congress, SP, BSP, CPM, TMC and JD (U) —were protesting simultaneously against the withdrawal of three Bills
 ye vidheyak the: beemaa kanoon (sanshodhan) bill, koyala khadaan (vishesh praavdhaan) bill or motor vaahan (sanshodhan) vidheyak
 The government had to take steps backward
 tiemasi, vam dal or sapa to beemaa vidheyak ke puraane virdohi maane jate hai
 The Congress has an objection to the Coal Mines Bill
 sambhav he ki is puure satr ke dauraan bhi in vidheyakon ko lekar tanatani bani rahe
 But the uproar is due to a new amendment to the Land Acquisition Bill, which has been renamed the 'right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (amendment) Bill 2015'
 vidheyak pesh karne ke liye spikar kii anumati maangane ke fouran baad hi samooche vipaksh ne narebaaji or virodh pradarshan karte hue sadan se walkout kar diya
 Given the strength of the BJP in the lower house, it is possible for the government to get it passed
 jedy (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ne rajyasabha main yahaan tak kah daalaa, ''sarkaar vipaksh ko rond daalane par amada he
 "but the real obstacle will be in the upper house
" haalanki agar vipaksh vidheyakon ko atakata rahaa to sheersh sarkari sutara sansad kaa sanyukt adhiveshan bulaane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin karte
 It is at this point that a new, revised Modi strategy emerges: sweetly trying to push opposition leaders towards selective cooperation
 sarkari adhikari bataate hai ki modi ne sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ko bajet satr kii purv sandhya par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane ke liye bheja
 On the first day of the session Modi himself crossed the aisle and greeted Sonia Gandhi and other opposition leaders including Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mallikarjun Kharge and Biju Janata Dal's Bhatruhari Mehtab
 aisa karke unhone sanket diya ki ve sheetakaaleen satr main vipaksh kii maangon par apni asahyogaatmak chuppi se peeche hate hai or ab sahyog chaahate hai
 There were enough indications in both houses that BJP leaders are leaving no stone unturned to appease potential paladis from the queues of the opposition
 iskaa sabase acha sakshya mila rajyasabha main
 When the Deputy Leader of the Congress Anand Sharma was speaking on the Land Acquisition Ordinance, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley showed his best fighting ability
 lekin isi mudde par bispi netaa mayawati or sapa sadsy ram gopal yadav ke bhaashanon ke dauraan bijepi sadasyon ko tokaatoki karne se rokane ke liye sansadeey maamalon ke rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi nirdesh dete najar aae
 Now there was no doubt about the fact that the government is looking forward to these two parties to get out of the crisis in Rajya Sabha
 pichhali upie sarkaar ke saath bhi in dalon kaa mahatvapurn vidheyakon ke maukon par meljol rahaa tha
 In fact, Jaitley went two steps ahead
 ve in donon netaaon ko or khush karne ke liye uthaae gaye muddon kaa jawaab dene ke liye uthakar khadey hue
 Mayawati said, "the Land Acquisition Bill of 2013 was brought and passed with the consent of all political parties
 lekin ye (naveenatam) sanshodhan kisaan virdohi he
 Jaitley, while addressing his fears, said that the amendments would benefit the farmers
 yadav ne yah kahkar sarkaar kii khinchaai kii ki usne ek ahm vidheyak se jude aise mahatvapurn sanshodhano ke mudde par anya rajnatik dalon ko vishwaas main nahin liya
 Jaitley termed it a valuable suggestion and assured Yadav that the government would work on it
 sheersh sarkari padaadhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jetali ke aashwaasan kaa anivaary arth sarvadaleey baithak yojit karnaa nahin he
 This means that the government will explore the possibility of consultations one by one with representatives of different parties

 In view of this, it seems that BJP leaders have realized that it may take some time to calm the anger

 Senior government officials are more focused on silencing the opposition
 unhen congress se jaraa bhi lacheelepan kii ummid nahin he, lekin ve kehete hai, ''anya mahatvapurn vipaksh'' -yani sapa, bispi, ensipi or anya kshetreey partiyon—ke saath vichaar-vimarsh jari he
 In the past too, these parties have been responding accurately to the private signals of the government to help pass important bills
 sarkaar ek samanaantar ranneeti par bhi vichaar kar rahi he: zyada vivaadaaspad vidheyakon ko loksabhaa main pesh karvaa kar paarit karvaa liya jaae or agar vipaksh rajyasabha main ekajute rahata he to us par naitik dabaav daalaa jaae
 This will be a new route, which is not necessarily a happy one for Modi and his government

 If these rich people want to protect their cars throw a wrap over them, this is animal cruelty and needs stopping
 Really this is so crazy, you couldn't make it up you
 i mean stopping birds from perching in trees, whats next - maybe ban them from flying
 We need to round up all these human goofballs and force them to live below ground in the dark until they learn to appreciate nature

 Some stars counting the last breaths of life in space can give a clue to a planet full of life around them
 yah maananaa he harvard-smithsonian centre for estrophysics ke siddhantkaar avi loyab kaa
 According to Loyab, one needs to study the white dwarf or white Vamana stars to find life outside the Earth
 jab surya ke aakaar kaa koi tara marataa he to uski bahya parat main baari ubhaar aa jaataa he
 The hot core that survives after emergence is called the white dwarf
 loyab or unke sahyogi don maoj (tel aviv uniwarsity) anumaan karte hai ki sabase najdiki 500 safed bunon kaa surveykshan karne par ham prithvi jaise rahane laayak ek yaa adhik grahon kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 a statement from the harvard-smithsonian states that these encouraging results come from a new theoretical study
 isamen mana gaya he ki shwet vaaman taron kii parikrama prithvi jaise grah kar rahe hai
 That is why it is easy to detect oxygen in the planetary environment of white Vamana stars
 yah surya jaise kisi taare kii parikrama kar rahe prithvi jaise kisi grah ke paryaavaran main maujuud oxygen kaa pataa lagane se kahin zyada aasaan he
 a normal white dwarf is earth-shaped
 ise thanda or dhundhala hone main kaaphi vakt lagata he, lekin iske paas itani ushma ho sakati he ki vah apane aas-paas ke sansar ko arabon varsh tak garmi de sake
 Since the white dwarf is smaller and dimmer than the Sun, the planets must be close to it
 grahon ke rahane yogya hone ke alaava iske sataha par pani bhi hona chahie
 The planet makes a round of white dwarfs every ten hours from a distance of about one million miles

 On February 9, 2016, what could be more serious to the investigating agencies over the alleged sedition incident that they filed a charge sheet in three years
 varanaa laga tha ki hafton tak is mudde ke zarie channelon ko rashan pani uplabdh karaane ke baad isse godi media kii dilchaspee chali gai he
 During that time, what did TV feed you, you will not even remember
 aapako kya, hamamen se shaayad hi kisi ko yaad honge
 But now that the police have presented a charge sheet against Kanhaiya, Omar Khalid, Anirban, it is expected that the media will take the trouble of reading the 1200 pages charge sheet
 hamane chargeshit nahin padhi he
 We are not fully aware of what the police have argued to be evidence regarding their allegations
 police ne jo court main kaha he, sutron ne jo kaha he usee ke aadhaar par sab kuch he
 Before coming to that, we remember some old news related to this matter
 is cese ke saamne ke aane ke baad pehali baar godi media kaa swaroop saamne aayaa tha
 When the debate about nationalism broke on television, teachers in JNU started giving lectures about nationalism under the open sky, which is all on youtube

 After the death of Rohit Vemula in Hyderabad, the anger of the students was on the rise in some places

 On 11 February, BJP MP Mahesh Giri registers the case in this case and on 12 February Kanhaiya Kumar, Anirban and Umar Khalid are arrested
 19 march 2016 ko in teenon ko dilli hoicourt se bel mil jaati he
 Slowly, this case goes behind the scenes from the media
 ab jo media anirbaan, umr khalid or kanhaiya ko deshadrohi tehra rahaa tha usee media ke liye kanhaiya kumaar star vaktaa ban jate hai or unhen channelon ke kanklev main bulaayaa jane lagata he
 Kanhaiya's aide said that he was called as a star speaker at eight media conclaves and so far Kanhaiya has delivered speeches at 200 events

 Remember the media of that time also

 The incident on which the channels took such a fierce stance, when did those channels ask, where is the charge sheet in the JNU case
 kyon nahin aa rahi he
 This matter is not only about the investigation of the police, but also of the media trial
 jiskaa ab na to hisaab ho saktaa he or na insaaf
 There were many types of videos in the media, which then raised many questions
 ek saal baad kai media house main ek khabar chhapati he jise hafpost ne saar rup main pesh kiya tha
 India Today had made an exclusive report, stating that highly placed sources have said that the voice samples of Kanhaiya shouting anti-national slogans are not correct
 itani khabaren aati thim ki yah bhi kaha ki professor tak naare laga rahe the jinka kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 The then Police Commissioner BS Bassi had said that there is a lot of evidence that Kanhaiya Kumar shouted slogans when the Delhi government jumped into it and set up a magistrate inquiry on its behalf
 magistrate kii jaanch main kanhaiya kumaar ko clin chit mil gai
 Our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar said that chargesheet has to be submitted within 60 days in case of corruption, 90 days in case of serious crime and 180 days in case of terror

 maalegaanv bam blast maamle main jamaanat par baahar chal raheen sadhvi pragna singh thakur lagaataar khabaron main bani hui hai
 He is getting all round criticism for the remarks made on the martyr Hemant Karkare in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 apane bayaan par na keval vipakshi partiyon balki bijepi kii sahyogi partiyon ke netaa bhi is bayaan kii ninda kar rahe hai
 Even before the statement of Pragya Thakur, BJP has lost the Palla
 kuch din pehle pragna thakur ne daawa kiya tha ki mumbai ke aatankwaad nirodhak daste ke purv pramukh hemanth karkare ne unhen maalegaanv visphot maamle main galat tarah se fansaaya tha or vah apane karmon kii vajah se maare gaye
 Hemant Karkare was martyred during the Mumbai terror attacks
 saath hi pragna thakur ne hemanth karkare ko rashtradohi bhi bataaya tha
 Sadhvi had said that Karkare died in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack because she was cursed by Sadhvi after being fed up with the torture
 ab shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne sadhvi pragna ke bayaan par kaha ki kisi ko bhi shaheedon kaa apmaan karne vaala bayaan nahin dena chahie
 Sadhvi made a wrong remark for which she later apologized
 pragna thakur kii is tippanee par maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis pehle hi narazgi jataa chuke hai
 He had said that the late Karkare was a brave and rightful police officer and has been given the status of a martyr
 sadhvi pragna kii tippanee unka nijee mat he or ham iskaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 mp's complaint filed: Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot has filed a written complaint with the police in the matter of making comments against the martyr Hemant Karkare
 bhanot ne kaha, 'maine hemanth karkare ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee karne ke liye bhaajapa ummidavaar sadhvi pragna singh par karrwai kiye jane kii maang ko lekar ek naagarik ke rup main shahar police main shikaayat darj karai he
 i am offended by his statement against a martyr and have lodged a complaint as a citizen and not as a minister
 main unke khilaaf kanoon ke anusaar karrwai kiye jane kii maang kar rahaa hum
 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) activists also demonstrated in Thane on Saturday against the Sadhvi in thane
 saath hi pragna thaku ke khilaaf kaaryakartaaon ne naare bhi lagaae
 Seeing the escalation of the controversy, Sadhvi Pragya has withdrawn her statement
 sadhvi ne shuukravaar shaam ko kaha ki unke bayaan se dushman majboot ho rahe hai, isliye vah apni tippanee waapas le rahi hai
 Tell that on this statement of Sadhvi Pragya, Congress has already accused Sadhvi Pragya of being anti-national
 soshal media par bhi log pragna ke is bayaan kii aalochana kar rahe hai

 isamen bataaya gaya he ki vidyut vaahanon kii bharat main vyapak sambhaavna he
 This suggests that the central government is making plans for electric trains
 aisa isliye nahin ki yah vaahan paryaavaran anukool hai balki ye isliye bhi jaruri hai ki bharat vidyut vaahanon ke vinirmaan centre ke rup main ubhar saktaa he
 This will create employment and growth opportunities
 samiksha main bataaya gaya he ki vidyut vaahanon kii kul laagat kam karne or sabhi upabhoktaaon ke liye inhen paramparaagat vaahanon kaa aakarshak vikalp banane ke liye upyukt nitigat prayaas kiye jane kii jarurat he
 If by 2030, 30 to 80 percent of the total vehicles are electric, then a huge reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and a large amount of oil can be saved
 to kam ho jayega 846 million ton carbon dioxide utsarjananiti ayog kaa ullekh karte hue aarthik samiksha main yah anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki agar 2030 tak nijee kaaron main vidyut vaahanon kii 30%, commercial kaaron main 70%, bason main 40%, do or teen pahiyaa vaahanon main 80% pahunch ho jaae to carbon dioxide utsarjan main 846 million ton tathaa 474 million emtioi kii tel bachat ho sakati he
 This will also provide an opportunity to develop as a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles
 carbon dioxide kaa doosraa sabase bada utsarjan kshetra he parivahanaarthik samiksha main paryaavaran, van or jalwaayu parivartan mantralay (2018) kaa ullekh karte hue bataaya he ki bharat main audyogic kshetra ke baad parivahan kshetra carbon dioxide kaa doosraa sabase bada utsarjan kshetra he

 niti ayog kaa ullekh karte hue samiksha main bataaya gaya he ki bharat main do pahiyon vaale vidyut vaahanon kaa bikri main bada hissaa he
 In 2018, about 54,800 electric vehicles were sold
 ab yah jaruri ho gaya he ki sadak network ke saath paryaapt sankhya main charging stesan bhi banaae jaaen
 Electrical vehicles are not selling due to these reasons Limited availability of charging infrastructure in India is the main obstacle in increasing the purchase of electric vehicles
 vidyut vaahanon kii puri charging main lagane vaala samay bhi ek anya samasya he
 An important policy needs to be put in place with global charging standards for the country in mobilizing such infrastructure and increasing investment
 online nakshon or anya madhyamon se vidyut vaahanon ke upyogkartaaon ko saarvajanik chargeron ke bare main jaankaree uplabdh karana bhi jaruri he

 nagaland ke dimapur main central jail main band kathith rup se balaatkaar ke ek aaropee ko hajaaron logon kii bheed ne pehle to jail se nikaala, phir peet peet kar maar daalaa
 Our channel had pictures of this gruesome beating and the public beating the person to death
 lekin, hamane un tasveeron ko na to web medium or na hi tivi par dikhaaya
 Who will decide what punishment for which crime? Obviously court or legal process
 phir jab kisi aparaadh ke liye hamane kanoon vyavastha banaai hui he to kitna sahi he bheed banakar kisi aaropee yaa phir doshi bhi sahi, kaa katl kar daalana? dukhad yah he ki hamaare netaa bhi tikhe bayanon ke madhyam se apane rosh ko sahi disha dilaane main asamarth rahete hai
 Recently, in the Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan, opposing the documentary 'indiaja Doter' based on Nirbhaya, said, if the government is unable to take tough action on Nirbhaya's rapist Mukesh Singh, then hand it over to us, we take his 'good care' ' will that do
 dhyaan den ki repist ne documentry main apane kiye par koi afsos jaahir nahin kiya he or sara dosha nirbhaya par hi madha he
 But, it is true! This is a mirror of our society! nyaay bada hi pavitra sa kaam he
 Everyone wants to get it and give it to someone
 lekin ham khud kitne kathgharon main khadey hai, is par dekhne yaa baanchane kii fursat or jarurat hamen nahin hoti
 The biggest problem with justice is that it is found or administered on the double-edged sword of law and morality
 jo kathith taur par is tarah ke nyaay karata he, vah kabhi apane kadam ko kanoonee kadam ke taur par or kabhi naitik kadam ke taur par justiphi karata he
 There is a news that the prisoner who has recently been killed by thousands of people of Dimapur, there was a buzz in the crowd about how a Bangladeshi molested our girl? The leader of the bjp's North East unit, Navani even said that Naga society does not tolerate rape
 jis samaaj main rape ko bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa, vahaan rape hone hi nahin diya jaataa! aakhir repist isi samaaj kaa hissaa hote hai
 Nagaland CM says that the rape has not been confirmed yet
 aise main kya is baat kii bhi gunjaaish nahin rahati ki vyakti ne rape kiya na ho
 
 
 The If the case was of rape then it is necessary to get punishment and it is the work of law to decide what the punishment will be
 sochie, yadi isi kabhi chori, kabhi dakaiti, kabhi rape yaa kisi or aarope yaa dosha ke chalate bheed kathith taur par nyaay karti rahi to ham kaisaa barbar samaaj ban jaaenge! If we consider it right to judge the mob in any matter, in the suppressed tongue, it is said that 'it was supposed to happen, such criminals do not improve', then we have been completely humiliated by the mob by calling the Dalit and tribal women as 'kulata'
 Matters should also be kept silent on matters of being done

 'any other award? Yes, i have been sent a note by megastar Amitabh Bachchan, the letter written by him is an award in itself
 aap maanenge nahin meri jiti hui sari trophy mere drawing room main hai, lekin mistar bachchan ke note ko maine frem karaayaa ghar par rakhane ke bajaay maine use bank bhej diya he or loker ke andar rakh diya he
 When will the day come when your and Deepika's films will come and eventually both will live? (laughs) This is a very golden question, especially my mother wants me to make such a film
 wo aise film dekh kar kaaphi bhavuk ho jaati hai
 'lootera', 'ramlila', 'gunday' and now 'bajirao', all died
 ab main deepika ke saath koi aisi film karnaa chaahunga, jo sabase alag ho
 Have got used to one and a half sequences now? Yes sometimes i used to get up from sleep one night before shooting
 'bajirao' kaa dedh sikvence 12 din tak chalaa tha, wo bahut hi kathin din the, aakhir din main vahiin khadey khadey gir gaya tha
 It was a very scary scene
 us seen ke liye maine south jaakar special shiksha lee thi
 What is your acting method? People get confused nowadays
 har actor kaa alag-alag process he
 Think myself lucky? Yes, i consider myself very lucky, because i became what i wanted to be
 sabase bade diarectors ke saath kaam kar rahaa hum
 Who would give credit for success? My family is my support system
 wo mujhe har tarah se help karte hai
 You have achieved a big place in a short time? One is my dentist uncle, he is a big film devotee, he told me that when he came to know that i am playing the role of Bajirao Peshwa, he was scared for me and watching the film After that he messaged me that at the age of 29 i did such a role

 i am proud that i am going to work with them
 uske baad main ek behtareen diarector ke saath bhi kaam karuunga, naam nahin bataa saktaa
 If Sanjay Leela Bhansali made a film with someone else, it would break my heart
 maharashtra ke grahamantri jayant patil ne kaha ki aatanki ajmal aamir kasaab par chalaae ja rahe mukademe se yah sabit ho saktaa he ki jin aatankwaadiyon ne mumbai par hamalaa kiya tha ve pakistan se the or unhen padosi desh main prashikshan diya gaya tha
 Patil said, "people have demanded that Kasab should be publicly hanged at the Gateway of India
" ’’ main logon ke gusse ko samaj saktaa hum
 But the ongoing trial on the 26 / 11 terrorist incident can prove that Kasab and his associates had received training from a terrorist camp running from Pakistani soil

 Raghuraj Pratap Singh, ie Raja Bhaiya, who does politics of muscle power in Uttar Pradesh, is going to show his strength in politics once again
 is barkundake raja, raja bhaiya apni nai party lekar saamne aa rahe hai
 According to sources close to Raja Bhaiya, on November 30, when this Raja of Kunda completes his 25 years of politics, he will begin with a new party

 Raja Bhaiya's new party may be named "jansatta Party"
 yahi naam raja bhaiya ne chunaav ayog ko sujhaayaa he
 According to sources, it may be announced at a big rally at Ramabai Maidan in Lucknow on 30 November
 kabhi samaajawaadee party to kabhi bijepi ke saath nirdaleey rahakar apni siyasat karne vaale raja bhaiya apni nai party isliye lekar aa rahe hai kyonki koi bhi party philhal unke saath khadi hone ko taiyaar nahin he

 desh main loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kaa shankhanaad ho chukaa he or ummidavaar chunaav main namakan daakhil kar rahe hai
 The most important thing during the nomination process for elections is the bail amount
 saath hi aksar suna jaataa he ki kisi ummidavaar kii jamaanat jabt ho gai he
 
 
 In such a situation, we know what the bail amount is, how much it is and when it is seized
 
 
 kya he jamaanat raashi?kisi bhi chunaav main jab pratyaashee chunaav ladata he to parchaa bharte vakt use ek nishchit rakam jamaanat ke taur par chunaav ayog main jamaa kerani hoti he
 This amount is called electoral bail amount
 yah raashi kuch maamalon main waapas de di jaati he anyathaa ayog ise apane paas rakh letaa he
 How much is the bail amount? The bail amount is decided on the basis of every election and varies depending on the election
 panchayat ke chunaav se lekar loksabhaa chunaav tak jamaanat raashi alag alag hoti he
 This amount is different for general category and reserved category
 essi-asti varg ke ummidavaaron ko general varg ke ummidavaaron ke mukaable aadi raashi deni hoti he
 Bail amount for councilor election? During the election the general class candidate has to deposit Rs 5000 and reserved candidate Rs 2500 as security
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye jamaanat raashi?lok pratinidhitiv adhinium, 1951 kii dhara 34(1)(e) ke anusaar vidhansabha chunaav main general varg ke ummidavaaron ko 10 hajaar rupee or anusuchit jati / anusuchit janajati ke ummidavaar ko 5 hajaar rupee jamaa karne hote hai
 Earlier this amount was very less and the general class candidate had to deposit 250 and SC-ST candidates had to deposit Rs 125

 Bail amount for the Lok Sabha elections? On the other hand, the general class candidates who are going to submit a claim in the Lok Sabha elections have to pay a fee of Rs 25 thousand and the SC-ST candidates have to pay a fee of Rs 12,500
 2009 se pehle general varg ke liye yah raashi 10 hajaar rupee or essi-asti ummidavaar ke liye 5 hajaar rupee thi
 When is the bail forfeited? When a candidate is unable to secure one-sixth of the total valid votes cast in any constituency, his / her bail amount is deemed to be forfeited and the amount given during the nomination is not returned to them
 jaise agar kisi seat par 1 lakh logon ne vot diya he or ummidavaar ko 1 xxrep 4 6 se kam vot hasil hue hai to uski jamaanat jabt ho jaaegi
 Who gets the bail amount? - This amount is returned when a candidate's nomination is rejected or he / she withdraws their candidate
 - kisi ummidavaar kii voting shuru hone se pehle maut ho jaati he to yah raashi parivarajan ko waapas mil jaati he
 - If the candidate gets more than one-sixth of the total votes cast
 - agar koi ummidavaar chathe hisse jitna vot hasil nahin kar paata he or chunaav jeet jaataa he to unhen bhi raashi de di jaati he
 How much was the bail amount in 2014? In 2014, 8748 candidates submitted their claims, out of which 7502 candidates lost their deposits

 factory lagane kii ichha rakhane vaale agarwal ke saamne aadchan yah thi ki tab sarkaar ne pastisids factory ke liye license dene band kar die the
 So in 1980, he bought Northern Minerals Private Limited, a Gujarati-owned company on the verge of closure in Gurgaon, which at the time made the country's first pesticide gamaxine for Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)
 yahaan se kahani shuru hui
 Agarwal made relatives partners in this, borrowing from people

 And his loss was a quarter to three lakh rupees
 bainkon ne balance shit dekhte hi karj dene se manaa kar diya
 Raised money from the market on this
 factory ko daksh kaamgaar mil gaye or kaam chal niklaa
 Gamaxine started being made

 At that time, Pesticides was licensed by a handful of multinational companies
 kaccha maal bhi unheen ke paas hota
 Even if asked, he would have given a word
 aayaat ke license bhi unheen ke paas
 Aggarwal tried and earned one crore in 1983-84
 kaa aayaat license liya
 This removed the problem of raw materials and increased supply
 12 saal kaa trading kaa unka tajurba factory kii marketing main kaam aayaa
 In 1985 he set up a pesticide raw material factory in Sohna where cypermethylene and fenvarlet were manufactured

 lekin 1996 main dupont ne khud bharat aane kaa faisla kiya
 But by then the company was recognized worldwide

 Reached unka kahana he ki ''kisaanon ko aaj bhi pastisids kii jaankaree nahin he, jabaki ye unki paidaavaar badhaane main kargar hai
 There is a dire need to increase grain production in the country
 "agarwal company kii image se judaa ek dilachasp vakya sunaate hai

 dumini ne ab tak 12 maichon main 51
 Has scored 357 runs at an average of 00
 is dauraan dumini ne do ardhshtak lagaae hai, tathaa paanch baar naabad rahe hai

 Virender Sehwag scored 38 in 11 matches for Delhi Daredevils with a century and two half-centuries
 54 ke ausat se 424 ran banaae the, or unka strike rate 176
 It was 66
 isi tarah dekha jaae to phiseddi tiimon ke liye awwal pradarshan karne vaale khilaadiyon main ipel-5 main aathven paaydaan par rahe deccan chargers ke shikhar dhawan (569 ran) or camran white (479 ran) tathaa gendbaaj del sten (18 wicket) kaa naam gumnaam hi rahaa

 Ex-servicemen of the regular army came to Delhi with them on 1 November, but they all went towards Jantar Mantar that Ramkishan ji committed suicide

 He also wrote an application in the name of the Defense Minister - Today, there are thousands of soldiers like me who have done both

 raksha mantri or pradhanmantri kai baar van rank van pension kii baat kar chuke hai
 Recently, the Prime Minister said in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh that the previous government had given 500 crores for One Rank One Pension, but the current government has also released the first installment of around 5500 crores
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki van rank, van pension ke rup main 10,000 karod kaa bajet he, maine pradhanmantri banane ke baad faisla kar liya, kab ritair hoga, kis saal ritair hoga, kuch nahin, sabko van rank van pension milegaa
 Out of 10,000 crores, an amount of five and a half thousand crores has been given
 yani aadhi raashi bant chuki he
 Former Army Chief and now Union Minister VK Singh has also received a statement
 wike singh ne kaha ki afasar level par 90 fisadi se zyada maangen puri ho chuki he
 There is some problem at the level of soldiers
 phir koi jawan aatmahatya kyon karegaa
 The question is whether all have received one rank, one pension
 hamaare sahyogi arshad jamaal upi ke itawa ke sainik kalyaan board ke daftar gaye
 This is an institution of the state government, whose job is to settle the disputes of former soldiers with the concerned departments
 maine bhi dilli se do teen sainikon se baat kii ki van rank, van pension ke bare main jo kaha ja rahaa he, kya unhen mil rahaa he
 a member of the Sainik Welfare Board said that there are 6,491 ex-servicemen in Etawah
 is daftar ke sutron ne bataaya ki zile main sirf 30 se 40 pratishat sainikon ko hi van rank, van pension kii pehali kisht mili he
 Every day someone comes to ask if there was any information about pension
 yahaan aane vaale badi sankhya main sainik bataate hai ki bahuton ko pension order nahin mila he
 One soldier said that fifty percent of the soldiers did not get the amount of One Rank, One Pension
 pratishat main bhale antar ho magar baton se laga ki aadhe se bhi zyada ritair sainikon ko van rank, van pension kii kisht nahin mili he
 The fellow soldier who accompanied Ramkishan ji who committed suicide, also said the same thing
 kisi ko mila he kisi ko nahin mila he
 Giving his father's army number, a person from Etawah said that Havildar Bhikham Singh, a resident of Lucknow's Village Post Garhi Chalty, has not received the installment of One Rank, One Pension
 milegi bhi yaa nahin, isaki koi soochna un tak nahin pahunchi he
 His son called his father's army number 2947955
 kaha ki 89 main ritair hue the or 11,000 pension mil rahi he, jabaki van rank, van pension kii raashi kaa abhi tak pataa nahin
 Union Minister VK Singh said that there are problems regarding the soldiers, but 90 percent demands of officers have been met
 dekhiye yahaan bhi afasar kaa kaam pehle hota he, javaanon kaa kaam baad main hota he
 Similarly, Havildar Balaram, who retired from an electronic mechanical engineer, told him over the phone that he retired in 2012
 abhi tak van rank, van pension kii koi kisht nahin ai he
 The pension of some of his colleagues has arrived
 van rank, van pension ke tahat nai pension raashi kya hogi, kitne kii kisht milegi, iske liye pension order nahin mila he
 Those who have received money in their account have also not received any pension order, how much should be received and how much is being given
 kam se kam hamane jitanon se baat kii, sabane ye baat kahi he
 i also called up Gambhir Singh, the Subedar of Auraiya, UP, who retired from the Army Medical Corps of Lucknow in 2003
 gambhir singh ne bataaya ki 2003 main ritair hone ke baad unhen 25,506 rupee pension ke taur par mil rahi thi
 They have received two installments of three thousand three thousand ie 6000, but no pension order has been received as to what will be the new amount under One Rank, One Pension
 magar 6,000 rupaya kis hisaab se diya gaya yahi pataa nahin hai
 Gambhir Singh said that after him the amount of 16,000 has come in the account of some of the fellows who have retired from different units and ranks, then 21,000 in the account of someone
 magar sabakaa kahana he ki kisi ke paas ye likhit nahin he ki unki nai pension kya hogi, 16,000 kyon diya ja rahaa he
 No new pension amount has come to the account of most colleagues
 zyaadaatar sainik isaki bhi shikaayat karte mili ki saatven vetan ayog kaa paisa nahin mila he, jabaki naukarshahi ke kai angon ko mil chukaa he
 If our soldiers do not think for a moment in giving up their lives, should the government not do their pension and salary work too quickly
 ek aise vakt main jab har din sena ke javaanon kii baat ho rahi he, unke naam par sawaalon ko dabaaya ja rahaa ho, ek sainik kii aatmahatya kii khabar saamaanya to nahin he

 Rahul Gandhi was also stopped at the hospital gate

 Then as soon as it was learned that Ramkishan Gerewal's family is at the Connaught Place Police Station, Rahul reached there
 jahaan unhen police ne dobaaraa ditten kar liya
 By then, all the Congress leaders and workers reached there
 ab police ne rahul ko bithakar thane-thane ghumana shuru kar diya
 The police first took them to the Parliament Street police station, then to the Tilak Marg station, then to the Connaught Place police station
 vahaan samarthakon kii bheed thi, to vahaan se phir tilak maarg thane le ai
 But the question arises why Rahul was not allowed to meet the family of Ramkishan Gerewal
 police afasar emke meena sahab itane kyon ade rahe
 Has Meena Sahab made a rule for hospitals that no leader will visit the hospitals and meet the victim's family
 kya ye niyam sabake liye he
 Is it not common news that a former soldier Ramkishan Gerewal has committed suicide
 unke bete media se baat to kar hi rahe hai, phir in logon kii mulaakaat rahul gandhi yaa manish sisodiya se ho jaati to kya ho jaataa
 However, Rahul was released in the evening

 The police first took them to the Parliament Street police station, then to the Tilak Marg station, then to the Connaught Place police station
 vahaan samarthakon kii bheed thi, to vahaan se phir tilak maarg thane le ai
 But the question arises why Rahul was not allowed to meet the family of Ramkishan Gerewal
 police afasar emke meena sahab itane kyon ade rahe
 Has Meena Sahab made a rule for hospitals that no leader will visit the hospitals and meet the victim's family
 kya ye niyam sabake liye he
 Is it not common news that a former soldier Ramkishan Gerewal has committed suicide
 unke bete media se baat to kar hi rahe hai, phir in logon kii mulaakaat rahul gandhi yaa manish sisodiya se ho jaati to kya ho jaataa
 However, Rahul was released in the evening
 raksha mantri or pradhanmantri kai baar van rank van pension kii baat kar chuke hai
 Recently, the Prime Minister said in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh that the previous government had given 500 crores for One Rank One Pension, but the current government has also released the first installment of around 5500 crores
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki van rank, van pension ke rup main 10,000 karod kaa bajet he, maine pradhanmantri banane ke baad faisla kar liya, kab ritair hoga, kis saal ritair hoga, kuch nahin, sabko van rank van pension milegaa
 Out of 10,000 crores, an amount of five and a half thousand crores has been given
 yani aadhi raashi bant chuki he
 Former Army Chief and now Union Minister VK Singh has also received a statement
 wike singh ne kaha ki afasar level par 90 fisadi se zyada maangen puri ho chuki he
 There is some problem at the level of soldiers
 phir koi jawan aatmahatya kyon karegaa
 The question is whether all have received one rank, one pension
 hamaare sahyogi arshad jamaal upi ke itawa ke sainik kalyaan board ke daftar gaye
 This is an institution of the state government, whose job is to settle the disputes of former soldiers with the concerned departments
 maine bhi dilli se do teen sainikon se baat kii ki van rank, van pension ke bare main jo kaha ja rahaa he, kya unhen mil rahaa he
 a member of the Sainik Welfare Board said that there are 6,491 ex-servicemen in Etawah
 is daftar ke sutron ne bataaya ki zile main sirf 30 se 40 pratishat sainikon ko hi van rank, van pension kii pehali kisht mili he
 Every day someone comes to ask if there was any information about pension
 yahaan aane vaale badi sankhya main sainik bataate hai ki bahuton ko pension order nahin mila he
 One soldier said that fifty percent of the soldiers did not get the amount of One Rank, One Pension
 pratishat main bhale antar ho magar baton se laga ki aadhe se bhi zyada ritair sainikon ko van rank, van pension kii kisht nahin mili he
 The fellow soldier who accompanied Ramkishan ji who committed suicide, also said the same thing
 kisi ko mila he kisi ko nahin mila he
 Giving his father's army number, a person from Etawah said that Havildar Bhikham Singh, a resident of Lucknow's Village Post Garhi Chalty, has not received the installment of One Rank, One Pension
 milegi bhi yaa nahin, isaki koi soochna un tak nahin pahunchi he
 His son called his father's army number 2947955
 kaha ki 89 main ritair hue the or 11,000 pension mil rahi he, jabaki van rank, van pension kii raashi kaa abhi tak pataa nahin
 Union Minister VK Singh said that there are problems regarding the soldiers, but 90 percent demands of officers have been met
 dekhiye yahaan bhi afasar kaa kaam pehle hota he, javaanon kaa kaam baad main hota he
 Similarly, Havildar Balaram, who retired from an electronic mechanical engineer, told him over the phone that he retired in 2012
 abhi tak van rank, van pension kii koi kisht nahin ai he
 The pension of some of his colleagues has arrived
 van rank, van pension ke tahat nai pension raashi kya hogi, kitne kii kisht milegi, iske liye pension order nahin mila he
 Those who have received money in their account have also not received any pension order, how much should be received and how much is being given
 kam se kam hamane jitanon se baat kii, sabane ye baat kahi he
 i also called up Gambhir Singh, the Subedar of Auraiya, UP, who retired from the Army Medical Corps of Lucknow in 2003
 gambhir singh ne bataaya ki 2003 main ritair hone ke baad unhen 25,506 rupee pension ke taur par mil rahi thi
 They have received two installments of three thousand three thousand ie 6000, but no pension order has been received as to what will be the new amount under One Rank, One Pension
 magar 6,000 rupaya kis hisaab se diya gaya yahi pataa nahin hai
 Gambhir Singh said that after him the amount of 16,000 has come in the account of some of the fellows who have retired from different units and ranks, then 21,000 in the account of someone
 magar sabakaa kahana he ki kisi ke paas ye likhit nahin he ki unki nai pension kya hogi, 16,000 kyon diya ja rahaa he
 No new pension amount has come to the account of most colleagues
 zyaadaatar sainik isaki bhi shikaayat karte mili ki saatven vetan ayog kaa paisa nahin mila he, jabaki naukarshahi ke kai angon ko mil chukaa he
 If our soldiers do not think for a moment in giving up their lives, should the government not do their pension and salary work too quickly
 ek aise vakt main jab har din sena ke javaanon kii baat ho rahi he, unke naam par sawaalon ko dabaaya ja rahaa ho, ek sainik kii aatmahatya kii khabar saamaanya to nahin he
 This news started spreading from website to Twitter timeline

 ek sainik ne kaha ki pachaas fisadi sainiko ko van rank, van pension kii raashi nahin mili he
 There may be a difference in percentage, but it was felt that more than half of the retired soldiers have not received the installment of One Rank, One Pension
 aatmahatya karne vaale ramkishan ji ke saath aae saathi sainik ne bhi yahi baat kahi thi
 Somebody's got nobody's got it
 itawa ke ek vyakti ne apane pita kaa army number dete hue kaha ki lakhanu ke gram post gadhi chunauti ke rahane vaale hawaldaar bheekhm singh ko van rank, van pension kii kisht nahin mili he
 Whether or not they will get any information has not reached them

 At least everyone we talked to has said this

 Gambhir Singh said that after retiring in 2003, he was receiving Rs 25,506 as pension
 unhen teen teen hazaar kii do kisht yani 6000 kii rakam to mili he, lekin koi pension order nahin mila he ki van rank, van pension ke tahat nai raashi kya hogi
 But according to which the 6,000 rupees were given, it is not known
 gambhir singh ne bataaya ki unke baad alag-alag unit or rank se ritair hue kuch saathiyon ke khate main 16,000 kii raashi ai he, to kisi ke khate main 21,000 kii raashi
 But everyone says that no one has written what their new pension will be, why 16,000 is being given
 zyaadaatar saathiyon ke khate main to pension kii koi nai raashi nahin ai he
 Most soldiers also complained that money from the Seventh Pay Commission has not been received, while many parts of the bureaucracy have been received
 jaan dene main to hamaare sainik ek pal kii nahin sochate to kya sarkaar ko unki pension or vetan kaa kaam bhi jaldi-jaldi nahin kar dena chahie
 At a time when army personnel are being talked about every day, questions are being pressed in their name, the news of suicide of a soldier is not normal

 apane twitor acount ke jariye oktober maheene kii alag alag tarikhon par irfan pathan kai cricketron ko unke janmdin kii badhai dete rahe hai or ab unka khud kaa janmdin aa gaya
 On this occasion, Master Blaster, who has played many international matches with him, first wished Irfan a birthday and then asked when Biryani was feeding
 a very happy birthday@irfanpathan! Biryani kab khila raha hai?— sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt)october 27, 2016chaliye ham aaj irfan ko unheen ke andaaj main yaad karte hai unke un teen karnaamon se jo unhone pakistan ke khilaaf pehle to pakistan kii hi dharti par kiye or phir jab cricket apane nae formet ke toornament world tii20 dekh rahaa tha to uske final ko bhi irfan ne special bana diya
 Can not forget dhoni-irfan's partnership Many experts called Irfan Pathan the most talented cricketer of swing and seam bowling after Kapil Dev
 antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan ke kuch saalon baad to unhen ek olerounder ke taur par kapil dev ke uttaradhikari ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Why not? Whenever i talk about Irfan, i remember the Faisalabad and Karachi Test of the Indian team which went to Pakistan under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid in 2006
 faisalabad main pakistan pehali pari main 588 ran bana chukaa tha or jawaab main duusare wicket ke liye captain dravid or lakshmana ke bich 197 ranon kii saajhedaari ke baad keval 45 ranon ke bich dravid, lakshmana, tendulkar or yuvaraj out ho gaye
 In such a situation, there was a threat of followon on the team and from here Pathan played a partnership of 201 runs with Dhoni
 dhoni ne 148 ran banaae to pathan apane shatak se chook gaye or 90 ran banaakar elbeadblyoo out hue
 Pathan played on the wicket and Team India managed to draw the match
 test main sabase tej hetric kaa banaaya recordiske baad agle hi match main irfan ne wo karaamaat kiya jo tab se pehle test cricket main kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 In this match played at the National Stadium in Karachi, Pakistan got to bat first but they did not know how early Irfan is going to give them a blow
 irfan ko dravid ne pehla over thamaya or unhone apane pehle hi over main kahar dha diya
 On the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the match, he not only became the second Indian player to take a hat-trick after Harbhajan in Tests but also with any Test, by sending pavilions to the batsmen like Salman Butt, Captain Younis Khan and Mohammad Yusuf
 i also took the record of taking the fastest hat-trick
 pehle over kii samaapti par pakistan kaa score shunya par teen wicket tha
 Irfan played 29 Test matches for India from 2003 to 2008
 isamen unhone 31

 apane test kariyar ke dauraan unhone saat baar pari main paanch wicket jabaki match main do baar 10 wicket liye
 Irfan's ODI career lasted 120 matches and during this period he scored 1544 runs including five half-centuries and took 173 wickets
 world tii20 final main pakistan kii todi qamar24 maichon ke tii20 cricket kariyar ke dauraan irfan ne 28 wicket liye
 During this time he made his mark in the first World T20 tournament of 2007
 toornament main irfan ne 14

 aitihaasik final main pakistan ke khilaaf 16 ranon par teen wicket lene ke karname ne jahaan team ko toornament kaa vijeta banaaya vahiin unhen main of da match kaa khitaab bhi dilaayaa

 At the same time, Ashutosh has tweeted that he is still inside the police station and his medical test will be done shortly

 When Shazia was asked if she would apply for anticipatory bail before going with the Delhi Police, she said, "it will not be needed, because i have done nothing wrong
" ham log aawaaj uthaate hai, haath nahin

 'police ke saath jane se pehle ashutosh ne kaha ki vah kanoon ko maanane vaale desh ke naagarik hai or jaanch main puraa sahyog karenge

 The Commission has prepared a report on this uproar
 isse pehle, bijepi ke netaa aam aadmi party ke khilaaf shikaayat karne chunaav ayog pahunche

 ’’ amit shah ne pichley saal navaratri ke pehle din bareli main party kaaryakartaaon kii ek close-door meeting main ye baaten kahi thim
 At that time he was the acting general secretary of Uttar Pradesh BJP
 bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke liye us hindi pradesh main ‘‘vyapaar kariye’’ asaamaanya muhaavara tha
 This was different from his political vocabulary of Ram Mandir and other stories of Hindutva
 shah bijepi kii kendriya vichaardhaara se aparichit nahin the
 They were creating a new political brand which could turn into a big currency
 bazaar kii is len-dein kii bhashaa ne bijepi main jagah bana lee he
 It has created a new culture in the BJP by making unprecedented growth, which has some special things and it has been clearly seen in the promotion of Haryana and Maharashtra
 (maharashtra main bijepi ke netaa devendra fadanvis)nai ichhashaktibadi bajeeuncha daanv lagaae bina kuch hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Instead of adopting a safe and alternative route, going alone in Maharashtra and Haryana, the BJP has given a clear message that Modi and Shah will try to maintain the current edge as long as they can
 isane saare gathbandhan sahyogiyon or sabhi sattarudh kshetreey dalon ko chethivani di gai he
 Strictly bargaining The modi-shah duo completely follows this central principle
 isi ke tahat kade faisle liye jate hai jo aasaani se saudebaaji main behtareen sabit hote hai
 As a result, despite a 25-year-old emotional alliance with the Shiv Sena, Shah was very clear about the level of bargaining
 donon ke bich sahmati na hone ke baad unhone adhik hangaamaa kiye bagaiyr apana rasta alag kar liya
 After the election results, even in the press conference, his style remained cool
 jab kisi ne poocha ki varisht netaa el
 K
 adwani ne shivasena ke saath dobaaraa gathbandhan banane kii ichha jataai he, to shah ne kaha, ‘‘hamane suna he
 "maintaining the brand: Here is the premise that good performance will make bjp's prime brand Narendra Modi more powerful
" shah ke shabdon main yah vah karency he jo kaam kar rahi he
 According to Shah - Modi first became a challenge with promises and now he has become a performer with a few months work of the Prime Minister
 paroksh rup se isamen bazaar kii ek hoshiyaari haih ek bada brands chote brands ko apane main samaa letaa he
 Therefore, the chief ministerial candidate will no longer be the posterboy in the assembly elections
 yah bijepi kii parampara se saaf taur par alag he
 Reducing the burden: The waste goods and furnishings should never be taken with you before going into the woods
 shah ne kuldeep bishnoi ke netritv vaali haryana janhit congress ko khud se us samay ek jatke main alag kar liya jab unhone dekha ki modi lahar main bhi bishnoi loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi seat nahin jeet sake
 This alliance was formed about two years ago by Nitin Gadkari and Sushma Swaraj
 phir ise hastakshrit samjhaute ke jariye majboot banaaya gaya
 Shah distanced himself from it
 patibaddhta kaayam rakhanadakoi bhi project bada yaa chota nahin hota
 Whether it is the small state of Haryana or the vast Maharashtra, always use the best resources in an effective manner and strike them
 isliye modi ne donon rajyon ko samaan samay dete hue 10 din rakhe
 The most trusted people of the organization were sent to try their electoral management effectively
 om maathur or sunil bansal ko maharashtra to kailash vijayawargeey ko haryana bheja gaya
 Union ministers such as Radha Mohan Singh, Dharmendra Pradhan, Santosh Gangwar and Manoj Sinha were employed as general workers and had to listen to the people of the organization for their scheduled projects
 satta kaa centrein rajyon ke chunaav ne modi or shah ko bijepi main satta ke iklaute centre ke taur par sthapit kar diya he
 Their success will marginalize party leaders and coalition partners
 haryana or maharashtra main sthaneey chehre ko bhunaae bagaiyr baari kamyaabi hasil karne vaale bijepi sthaneey mahatvakankshi kshatrapon ko bhav dene ke mood main nahin he
 Therefore, Arjun Munda in Jharkhand and Sushil Kumar Modi in Bihar cannot follow their positions
 jahaan tak gathbandhan sahyogiyon kii baat he, isse algepi ke ramvilas paswan or rashtriya lok samta party ke upendra kushvaha ko bhi sandesh jayega
 Both had become bjp's allies in Bihar before the recent Lok Sabha elections
 jeviem netaa babulal marandi ke liye bhi yah memo kii tarah he, jo jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bijepi ke saath kadi saudebaaji karne kii firaaq main hai
 Though Punjab Assembly elections are due in 2017, which is still far away, there is no need to negotiate or negotiate the conditions there
 khaskar haryana main ieneldi ko shiromani akali dal kii ore se samarthan dene ke baad
 Says a senior BJP leader, "for the first time, we saw Shiv Sena coming to the BJP office to negotiate seats
 isse pehle hamane apane varisht netaaon ko matoshri jate dekha tha
 After the changed equations with the Shiv Sena, this glorious view has taken place in the bjp's party cadre
 saaf taur par pehali baar bijepi ke paas aisa netritv he jo haai kaman kii tarah kaam kar rahaa he
 This example illustrates the new modalities of the BJP: Maharashtra's command was actually given to Om Mathur, replacing General Secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 aage kii chunautiyanmaharashtra or haryana main bijepi kii jeet kaa matlab he ki vah apane pramukh rajnatik mansoobey yani ‘‘congress mukt bharat’’ ke najadik he
 This slogan was also carried out before and after the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki party kii agali jang kshetreey dalon ke khilaaf he
 Party strategists believe that henceforth change this slogan into a companion with Modi, this atmosphere should be turned into a positive wave
 jharkhand or jammu-kashmir main, bijepi ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki bhrasht or aprabhavi congress apane kshetreey dalon ko bhi khatm karegi
 BJP does not want to miss this opportunity
 modi sabase achche vikalp ke rup main dikhaae jaaenge
 Regional parties face the challenge of strengthening local identity
 shivasena isamen naakaam rahi, lekin kshetreey dalon ke paas baaji palatney ke liye bas yahi ek ummid ho sakati he
 As the Maharashtra election has shown, the results are not always in line with expectations
 shah ne bareli main apane kaaryakartaaon ko jo bijness logic diya tha, us par chalate hue nai bijepi ko bahut saare saude radd karne honge, riyaayaten deni hongi or power share karnaa hoga
 It will be interesting to see how the modi-shah duo will tackle their next major challenge, with this will

 In Ranipur area of bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh, today a case of hanging a tree after killing a woman after allegedly gang-raping her has come to light
 apper police adheekshak sunil kumaar singh ne yahaan bataaya ki ranipur thana kshetra ke loninpurva gaanv kii rahane vaali 45 varshiya ek mahila kal apana ilaaj karaane ke liye lakhanu ravaanaa hui thi
 On the way, her son called her and informed her of her grandmother and asked her to return home
 singh ne bataaya ki mahila ne baharich pahunchakar apane bete ko phone karke use le jane ko kaha tha
 When the son reached the bus station with a motorcycle, his mother could not find him there and his mobile phone was also found locked
 unhone bataaya ki mahila kaa ardhangn shav aaj ek baag main ek sari ke fande se lataka mila
 There was bleeding from his genitals
 paas main hi uskaa mobile phone or chappal bhi padi thi
 Singh said that it is alleged that five people from the village gang-raped him and murdered him and hanged the body from the tree

 The Central Government is going to tell the Government of Jammu and Kashmir that the Public Safety Act should be done properly i
e
 'judicial Use'
 yah kadam centre sarkaar masarrat alam ko lekar jo uski kirkari hui use dhyaan main rakhte hue uthaa rahi he
 a senior home ministry official told NDTV India, 'we are going to write to the state government soon to use judicial use of Public Safety Act
 ' darasal masarrat kii rihaai ke baad sarkaar ko vipaksh se kaaphi kuch sunanaa padaa tha
 Both BJP and PDP had come face to face regarding this matter
 vaise upie sarkaar ne jin teen interlocuters (vaartakaron) ko niyukt kiya tha, unhone piese kanoon main kai sanshodhan laane kii baat kahi thi
 He believed that every delegation he met spoke against PSA law
 unke mutabik, is kanoon ke tahat rajya sarkaar ko beshumaar haq die gaye hai or zyaadaatar agenciyaan iskaa galat istemaal karti hai
 The most problematic was the section eight of chapter six of PSA
 iske tahat district magistrate yaa phir colector kisi bhi shaks ko hiraasat main le saktaa he
 Then the government has to approve its decision in 12 days
 interlocuters ke mutabik is samay-seemaa ko gata kar chaar din kar dena chahie
 The second big thing that these interlockers wanted to bring to the attention of the government was that crimes under the PSA Act are not discriminated against
 agar koi shaks public sefti ke liye khatra hai to use ek saal ke liye ditten kiya ja saktaa he or agar vah rajya kii suraksha ke liye khatra he to do saal tak use hiraasat main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The interlocutors said that under the Public Safety Order, minor offenses also come and some cronies are also why under this one should be detained for one to two months and as far as the safety of the state is concerned, the time limit for detention is only Should be three months
 uske baad maamle main trial hona chahie
 The interlocutors also wrote in their report that no minor should be booked under this law
 darasal masarrat ke maamle ne bijepi ko bataa diya he ki yah gathbandhan itnaa aasaan nahin rahegaa
 Gradually, he will have to give due attention to the report given by the interlocutors and not to look at the law and order of Kashmir, but to connect people and relations
 raashtrapati donald trump ne vishwa ke netaaon ko apana phone number diya he or unase sidhe unhen phone karne ko kaha he
 Trump's invitation is a violation of diplomatic protocol and concerns about the security and privacy of the US commander
 is maamle se jude america ke purv evam vartmaan ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki trump ne canada or mexico ke netaaon se sidhe unhen phone karne ko kaha he
 Officials said that of the two, only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trundo has so far taken advantage of the proposal
 trump ne france ke raashtrapati imanyuel macron ke saath bhi nijee phone number kii adla badali kii, jabaki france ke adhikariyon ke mutabik donon ne is maah kii shuruyaat main macron kii jeet ke turant baad baat kii thi
 However, officials did not say whether Macron would call them now
 tippaniyan However, the officials said this on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to give such information
 white house athwa trundo ke karyaalay ne bhi is par koi pratikriya nahin di he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Trump also swapped private phone numbers with French President Emmanuel Macron, while according to French officials, the two spoke shortly after Macron's victory earlier this month
 haalanki adhikariyon ne yah nahin bataaya ki ab macron unhen phone karenge athwa nahin
 The comments haalanki adhikariyon ne apana naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par yah baat kahi kyonki vah is prakaar kii jaankaree dene ke liye adhikrut nahin hai

 uttar pradesh kii do naaballig bahanon ne anjaane main galat train pakad lee or maharashtra pahunch gayi
 The elder sister is mentally incapacitated and the other is only four years old
 donon ko thane police ne apane paas rakhaa
 The police formed a whatsapp group and found out the parents of the girls
 police ke mutabik donon bahanon main se 17 varshiya kishori maansik rup se aksham he or duusari bacchee chaar varsh kii he
 Both hail from Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh
 police upayukta (aparaadh) deepak devraj ne bataaya ki pichley maheene donon nikatavarti chandauli jila sthit apni ek rishtedaar ke yahaan ain thi
 On the way back, the girls had boarded the train to Mumbai instead of boarding the Ghazipur train
 bhojpuri bhashaa bolne vaali ladkiyaan 15 janvari ko thane railway stesan par mili thim lekin ve apane ghar kaa pataa nahin bataa paa rahi thim

 unhone bataaya ki mata-pita thane pahunche, jahaan somvaar ko bacchiyon ko unke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Language - IANS radhe maa kahin baad main pahunchati hai, vivaad usase pehle pahunch jate hai
 After all, why is Radhe Ma such? Why has Radhe Maa been accused of harassing a girl for dowry, spreading obscenity and being a fake saint? Why does Radhe Maa often think that it would have been good if she had consumed her life by consuming poison? logon ne use thag kaha, wo kuch nahin boli
 It was a gift to tear down the house, even then his lips were silent
 magar ab suniye sabase pehle sirf ajtak par radhe maa kaa dard or uski aap-beeti
 Every aspect of his life
 
 Every secret
 
 From in-laws to maiden
 
 From Delhi to Mumbai
 
 Know the full story from Babbo to becoming God
 ajtak ko bataai man kii baatraadhe maa jab ajtak ke camere par ai to usne kaha 'main nahin hum durga kaa avatar
 My trident is my religion
 main insaaniyat ko maanati hum
 i will not change my style jo farzi kahegaa, wo bhugtegaa
 i have no secret cave
 main zehar khaanaa chaahati thi
 The allegations against me are false
 'lekin radhe maa se ajtak kii baatcheet kii ye to sirf shuruuaat bhar thi
 Radhe Ma opened all her secrets in front of Aaj Tak's camera
 kabhi wo hansi
 Ever cried kabhi bebas si khamosh hui or akhir main naaraaz hokar bhaag gai
 In the last few years, the name of Radhe Maa has been associated with so many controversies that even those who count can be tired
 radhe maa ke in vivaadon main ashleelata failaane se lekar, dahej ke liye sataane, khudakushi ke liye uksaane ke saath-saath apane guru ke qatl kaa vivaad bhi shaamil he
 It is another matter that Radhe Maa considers herself the burners responsible for all these disputes
 pal pal rang badalati radhe maanvo kabhi bhajan-kirthan karne vaali devi ban jaati he, to kabhi faishan kii duniya main dhamal machaane vaali baby
 But this is not the only two aspects of Radhe Ma's personality
 balki radhe maa to or bhi bahut kuch aisa kar karti hai, jo koi or ladki karne kii soch bhi nahin sakati
 And then a dispute about Radhe Maa does not end that the second one starts
 or radhe maa ke in vivaadon or radhe maa par lagane vaale in ilzaamon maamuli or chote-mote aaropon se lekar aise-aise sangeen gunahon tak ke ilzaam shaamil hai ki sun kar yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil ho jaae
 The allegations of dowry harassment were not made by any other non-resident, but by the daughter-in-law of a family who wanted Radhe Maa
 is ladki ne radhe maa ke khilaaf mumbai ke kandivali thaan main ek report likhavai thi
 The girl had told that Radhe Maa encouraged the boys to ask for dowry of Rs 25 lakh
 shaadi main aade ke liye helicopter or mahangi car kii maang kii or helicopter kii maang puri nahin hone par shaadi ke baad us par zulmo-sitam kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 In this case, the police also questioned Radhe Maa and had to go to the police station to attend
 yon utpeedan kaa aaropakabhi unki bhakt raheen film or tivi actress doli bindra ne bhi radhe maa par sangeen aarope lagaae the
 Dolly Bindra had said that she was sexually abused in the court of Radhe Maa
 doli ne radhe maa ke khilaaf police main shikaayat bhi darj karai thi or police ne radhe maa par ashleelata failaane ke aarope main bhi cese darj kiya tha
 Radhe Maa was also accused of plotting to kill his guru Mahant Ramadhin Das Paramahamsa, not being the master of his own master
 aarope bhi kisi or ne nahin balki unke guru bhai mahant shyaam sundar das ne aarope lagaae the
 Shyam Sundar Das, living in the ashram of Kangra had said that Radhe Maa had in fact created this conspiracy to gain Guruji's wealth
 mahamandaleshwar se farzi sant takaraadhe maa ko lekar uthne vaale vivaadon ke silsile main saal 2012 main tab ek or vivaad or jud gaya tha, jab santon ke june akhaade ne aanan-fanan main unhen mahamandaleshwar kii padavi de daali thi
 This title was withdrawn when there was an uproar
 aarope laga ki mahamandaleshwar kii oopaadhi hasil karne ke liye radhe maa ne baari rakam dene kii bhi peshkash kii thi
 But now the matter has increased
 akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad ne radhe maa ko farzi sant qaraar diya he
 tantra-mantra and Kala Jadugradhe Maa were also accused of cheating and harassing many people through tantra-mantra and black magic
 bataaya jaataa he ki apane aapako devi kaa avatar kehane vaali radhe maa jaadu-tona or tantra-mantra main bhi maahir hai
 There was also an accusation on Radhe Maa that through black magic and tantra mantra, she implicated people and provoked them even to suicide
 khudakushi ke liye uksaane kaa aaropradhe maa par gujarat ke kuccha main ek parivaar ke 5 logon ko khudakushi ke liye uksaane kaa iljaam bhi laga tha
 It is being said that the family members who committed suicide donated all their properties to Radhe Ma in the belief that there will be prosperity in their life
 lekin aisa kuch hua nahin, to hataasha main un logon ne khudakushi kar lee
 However, Radhe Maa denies the allegations of black magic and tantra mantra from the beginning
 lekin sach yahi he ki radhe maa ko lekar vivaadon or ilzaamon kii koi kami nahin

 The wait for one year is over and the annual Ganeshotsav will soon be going on
 puranic manyata he ki das divasiy is utsav ke dauraan bhagwaan shiv or parvati ke putr ganesh prithvi par rahete hai
 Acharya Akhyananda, who is interested in the scriptures, says that Lord Ganesha is called Vighnaharta
 unhen buddhi, samruddhi or vaibhav kaa devtaa maan kar unki puja kii jaati he
 According to the Hindu calendar, Ganeshotsav begins with Shukla Chaturthi in the month of Bhadon
 is din ko ganesh chaturthi kaha jaataa he
 Anant Chaturdashi comes after Ganpati Puja for ten days on which day this festival ends
ganeshotsav is celebrated with pomp puure bharat main ganeshotsav dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa he
 Although the history of Ganapati festival is quite old, the credit for turning this annual domestic festival into a huge, organized public event goes to freedom fighter and social reformer Lokmanya Tilak
 itihaas ke sevanivrutt praadhyaapak pro you ji gupta ne bataaya, ‘san 1893 main tilak ne brahmanon or gaiyr brahmanon ke bich kii duuri khatm karne ke liye elaan kiya ki ganesh bhagwaan sabhi ke devtaa hai
 For this purpose, they made public celebrations of Ganeshotsav and this started in Maharashtra spread across the country
 yah prayaas ekta kii ek misaal sabit hua
 Prof Gupta said that this conch shell of unity proved to be very effective in uniting the people of Maharashtra against British colonial rule
 tilak ne hi mandapon main ganesh kii badi pratimaaon kii sthapana ko protsaahan diya
 He also started the tradition of Ganesh Visarjan on the tenth day of Ganesh Chaturthi
 itihaas main gahari dilchaspee rakhane vaali pro amiya ganguli ne bataaya, ‘angrej hameshaa saamaajik or raajnneetik aayojanon ke khilaaf rahete the
 But during the Ganeshotsav, people of every class would gather and various schemes were made

 The process of Ganeshotsav is still going on and preparations start months before
 murtikar jahaan vighnaharta kii aakarshak murtiyon banaate hai, vahiin aayojak chanda ekatra kar mandap sthapit karte hai
 The size and value of the idols increased day by day and the enthusiasm of people towards this festival increased
 pandit aakhyaanand kehete hai, ‘roshni, tarah tarah kii jhaankiyon, phool maalaon se saje mandap main ganesh chaturthi ke din puja archana, mantrocchar ke baad ganpati sthapana hoti he
 This ritual is called hexachopachar
 bhagwaan ko phool or doob chadaaye jate hai tathaa nariyal, khand, 21 modak kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he
 Ganapati remains seated for ten days, and every day in the morning there is a ritual of hexachopath
 11 wein din puja ke baad pratimaa ko visarjan ke liye le jaaya jaataa he
 Ganesh Visarjan is performed on the third, fifth or seventh day in many places
