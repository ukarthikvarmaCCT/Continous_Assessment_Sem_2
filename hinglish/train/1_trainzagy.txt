 akhilesh yadav ne yah bhi kaha tha ki mayawati pehle bhi teen baar bijepi kii madad se sarkaar bana chuki hai isliye muslim un par katai bharosa naa karen

 Nasimuddin Siddiqui alleged that the Samajwadi Party was born with the help of the Jana Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party because in 1969, when Mulayam Singh first became an MLA from Jaswantnagar, he was formed with the help of the Jana Sangh
 bispi ne sawaal uthaaya kii 2012 ke ghoshnaa patr main samaajawaadee party ne vaayada kiya tha ki jail main band bekasoor musalamaanon ko reeha kiya jayega lekin yah vaayada bhi jhootha niklaa

 The Congress said - the decision to return the amount taken when the truth came to the fore, while on behalf of the Congress, senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that who knew that Zakir Naik is a man who would come under scrutiny because of his activities
 ham koi jyotishi to nahin hai

 Presidential candidate Sangma reached Bhopal on Sunday to garner support from Bharatiya Janata Party mps, mlas
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se charchaa karte hue kaha ki mukherjee dwaara bhartiya sankhyikee santhaan ke adhyaksh pad se die gaye istife main kiye gaye hastakshar ke masale ko lekar vah kanooneevidon se paraamarsh kar rahe hai
 Ramjethmalani and Subramanian Swamy are also in the team formed for this

 general bipin ravat chamkila nila blager or katthi rang kii faujee taai pahane hai
 They jokingly say that if the uniform is not worn then it becomes really difficult to identify them
 4 rajaji maarg par unke sarkari awaas army house kaa maahaul or kuch bhi ho, anaupchaarik to katai nahin
 Uniformed prisoners bring tea and special forces personnel guarding them are guarded
 general ravat apane pasandida project ke bare main baat karte hai, jisamen sena ko nae sire se dhaalane or sahi aakaar main laane kii itani badi kasarat amuman pehali baar chalaai ja rahi he
 They hope that this will reduce the number and increase the fighting ability of the army
 sena pramukh ek vistrut saakshaatkaar main agxcutive editor sandip unnithan ko dotuk bataa rahe hai ki sena main yah kayapalat kyon vakt kii jarurat he or isse sena ko kaise nayaa rang-rup milegaa
 Here are excerpts from the conversation
 aapane jo sudhaar prakriya shuru kii he, uskaa makasad kya he?iske teen makasad hai—hamaari kshamtaaon ko majboot karke bhavishya ke yudhon ke liye taiyaar hona, zyada chust-durust bananaa or hamaare bajet kaa behatar prabandhan karnaa
 How do you envisage the kind of war that the Indian Army may have to fight in the future? The northern frontiers of India are unstable and to some extent the western frontiers, where an enemy in front of us with Pakistan is with us We have not been able to keep pace
 lihaaja sarhadon par hamen apni maujuudagi banaae rakhni he, ham chaukasee gata nahin sakate
 We need military units, which are our eyes and ears, which have not been deployed on the borders forever, but if such situations arise then stay on the front
 ham maanavbal aadhaarit sena hai
 The second view is that the nature of war is changing
 bhavishya kii jang kaise ladi jaaengi? pehle choti-choti karravaayiyon kii jang hoti thi jo lambii chalati thim or jo tikaa rahata tha vah vijeta hota tha
 Now the war will not be fought in that way
 dushman alahada tareekon se jang ko anjaam denge, aisi jang jinamein koi sampark yaa aamanaa-saamana nahin hoga—sibar jang, manovaigyanik jang or kanoonee jang
 We have to take advantage of technology — space-based systems and long-range surveillance systems
 agar aapako soochnaaon kaa muqabla karnaa he or manovaigyanik jang ladgai he, to aapke sainya balon main aise sanghathan hone chahie jo aise masalon se nipat saken
 Some organizations within the army have become useless
 sahi aakaar main laane kaa yah kaam sainya balon kii kshamtaaon ko majboot karne, unhen zyada chust-durust banane or bhavishya kii jang ke liye taiyaar karne ke liye ho rahaa he
 So where we have to be ready for face-to-face and distant battles, we have to imbibe technology
 ranneeti or dhaanchon ko nai sibar jang or antariksh aadhaarit tatwon ke saath nae sire se sangathit karnaa hoga
 So does this mean that you are not going to get any more money from the government over the current budget allocation? There are schemes which have got the approval of the government and for which assurance has been given
 aisi jaruraton ke liye sarkaar ko hamen rakam deni hogi
 If you are going to come to Rafael tomorrow then you have to pay them
 hamen badi taadaad main hovitger milengi, unke liye rakam muhaiyaa kerani hogi
 By when will the army be ready to face the new challenges? Some changes like the restructuring of the army headquarters will begin immediately
 sibar yuddh or antariksh aadhaarit pranaaliyon ke liye hamen nae vertical kii darkaar he
 Parallel structures so that one agency can talk to another agency
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa he ki ham duusari do senaaon se apane ko kaise acchhee tarah jodate hai
 The Navy, Army and Air Force are no different in this case
 ham samaan pranaaliyon par kaam kar rahe hai or hamaara antim lakshya samaan he
 If the end goal is shared, then we are asking - why can't we join together? So with this you are going to start the process of coordination? Yes, it also (by restructuring) the process of coordination (with other forces)
 Will begin
 yah ise dekhne kaa hamaara tarika he
 In this way we will also join and will also complete jointmanship
 yah bhi nae sire se dhaalane kii is prakriya kaa hissaa he
 Are other forces coming together? Yes, they are coming
 ham mukhyalayon ke bheetar sanyukt staff rakhane ke prastaavon par aage bad rahe hai
 Having joint staff means that the Headquarters of the Army, Navy and Air Force will have each other's staff
 yah aage kaa rasta he
 At present, there is a Joint Staff ie Integrated Defense Staff (IDS) at Headquarters, but can we not have Joint Staff in Command and Corps? We are investigating this
 mukhyalay main staff rakhana to agle 4-5 maheenon kii samay seemaa main ho jayega
 The Army is working on the concept of Integrated Battle Group (IBG) by combining armored trains, cannons and infantry
 yah kaise kaam karegaa?ibiji ek aisi avadharana he jiske hamen silsilewar pareekshan karne honge
 We are asking the troops to conduct exercises and see how it will work
 hamane unhen ek khaakaa diya he or unhen (uske anuroop) abhyaas yojit karne honge or phir ve sudhaaron ke saath hamaare paas aaenge ki isamen kaise badlaavon kii jarurat he
 We have to look at each IBG keeping in view the given targets, terrain and environment of action
 jab jang ladgaye kii baat aegi to cold start kya ab bhi vikalp he?cold start kya he? cold start khud sakriy hokar behad tej rakrataar se aage baduya he
 It has happened and if you see where we were earlier, all things have progressed
 yah (cold start kaa siddhant) kahata he ki aap tab tak cold start nahin kar sakate jab tak systams ko sarhad par nahin le jate
 It is a continuous thing and is still happening
 aap jin tamaam sudhaaron par jor de rahe hai, kya sarkaar unamem aapke saath he?hamen puri ummid he
 In fact, i speak so impatiently about restructuring, so that everyone knows that something is happening within the army
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki har koi yah baat samajhataa he ki yah hamaare sansadhano ke behatar istemaal, bajet ke behatar prabandhan or dakshata main sudhaar laane ke liye he
 If these three principles are associated with this, then i do not think that there will be any opposition (from the government)
 philhal aapkaa zyaadaatar bajet rajasav kharch main chalaa jaataa he or puunji keval 17 fisadi he
 Have you got a guarantee from the government that if you reduce the expenses of revenue, then you will get more capital? Look at it in reverse
 aaj agar main sainya bal main mahaj 10,000 katautee kar luun, to iskaa matlab hoga 10,000 kam tankhwaahen, 10,000 kam pension
 
 
 So the revenue to capital ratio has changed on its own
 guarantee ek alag masalaa he
 Yes, i am sure that the government will help us
 jab ham unase kahenge ki ‘‘ham aadhe raste aa gaye hai, kya aap bhi taiyaar hai?ʼʼ to mujhe yakeen he ki ve samajhenge
 What will he say about his successors, they support these proposals? That is why i did not do this work alone
 maujuuda army cmanderon ko isamen saath liya he
 Most of them are also living with my successor's colleagues
 maine sevanivrutt diggaj sainikon kii birdari ko bhi saath liya he or unke saath is par charchaa kii he
 This is not something that is being done covertly
 sena main dheron chijen kii gai hai jo sena mukhyalay main faisle liye jane ke baad neeche kii jamaaton tak pahunchi hai
 We are not doing it like this
 aaj har koi jaanata he ki kuch ho rahaa he
 If people feel that this (improvement) is not good, then they should say it clearly now
 is punargathan kii roshni main mountain strike kor kya ab bhi ahm he?haa, yah behad keemtee he
 It is growing
 ham mountain strike kor ko bhi nae sire se dhaal rahe hai, taaki ise zyada se zyada chust or zyada sakasham bana saken
 i think in the mountains you need more agility within the force, the ability to change more quickly
 isliye ise nae sire se dhaalte hue ham iske aakaar main katarbyont kar rahe hai, ham logisticks kii dheron chizon ko kam kar rahe hai
 The country was not so developed in 1962, especially in the outskirts
 aaj ham jo vaahan kharidte hai—maaruti yaa tata—unke bikri centre kii suvidhaayen vahaan sarhad par hi maujuud hai
 
 
 So instead of building repair facilities ourselves, we can take their services directly on the outskirts
 ham bahut sara kaam outsource karne kii soch rahe hai
 Some of our buildings, ordnance factories, base workshops, etc
 
 
 dekhnaa hoga ki kya ham inamen civillian model ko shaamil kar sakate hai
 How many soldiers will be cut, 1,00,000 or more? Figures will finally be known when we finish the process of trials
 aapane jis aankade kaa zikr kiya, vah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki kitne pareekshan kaamyaab hote hai
 So the last rung desired is that (more than 100,000), but whether we will get there or not, i do not know
 agar hamaare saare pareekshan kaamyaab hote hai, to ham 1,50,000 ke aankade kii taraf dekh rahe hai
 But new additions are also needed
 to jahaan ham bachat kar rahe hai, vahiin isamen se kuch nai badhotariyon main waapas chali jaaengi
 So in the end the figure can be two-thirds of it
 kin badlaavon kii taraf dekh rahe hai?ham afasar kader ke punargathan kii soch rahe hai, promoshan kii sambhaavnaaon ko behatar bananaa chaahate hai
 We have a pyramid-like structure and because of this, one way or the other, it arises in the mind that officers are being left behind
 ham seva sharton main sudhaar laane ke tareekon ko bhi dekh rahe hai
 a young man comes to the army at the age of 18–20 and works for 15 years, then returns home, earning a pension
 ham dekh rahe hai ki kya use 35-37 saal ke baad bhi rakh sakate hai
 Today the life of our population is getting longer due to better health care

 laksminagar ilaake ke lalita park main ek imaarat giri, 70 nirdosh log maare gaye or koi 80 aspataal main jindagi-maut se jujh rahe hai
 An accident occurred, news was made and the 'accountable and responsible' administration started the ritual
 kisi bhi ghatana ke baad sarkari amala turant harakat main aata he
 The round of meetings begins and then an inquiry committee is formed, which keeps on investigating from year to year, but the report is not ready
 tab tak kahin or koi haadasa ho jaataa he or nirdosh log maare jate hai
 It is not that the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi did not know that the situation had become so frightening
 sarkaar kii ankhen tabhi khul jaani chahie thi jab rashtramandal khel gaanv kii imaaraton ke basament main pani bhar chukaa tha, jo tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi nahin nikal paa rahaa tha
 This year, due to heavy rains, the water level of Yamuna has come so high that the banks of the river have almost turned into marshes
 dilli main satta ke kai kendron kaa bahaanaa banaakar sarkari agenciyaan ek-duusare par aarope lagaate hue aam logon kii jindagi se khilwaad kar rahi hai
 Officers are filling their pockets
 amritpal singh jaise hajaaron log isi dilli main maujuud hai jo nagar nigam, didie or dilli police ke adhikariyon kii mutthi garam karke saare niyam-kanoonon ko taak par rakhte hai or is tarah kii imaaraten banaate hai
 In 2003, the non-government organization Kalyan Sanstha launched a campaign against illegal construction in Delhi and knocked at the court, following which the High Court ordered the illegal construction on mehrauli-gurgaon road to be demolished
 lekin koi karrwai kiye bina nagar nigam ne court main galat halafanama daakhil kar diya jiskaa pataa dilli hycourt ko varsh 2006 main laga
 Taking the entire incident seriously, the court ordered the corporation to demolish the illegal construction all over Delhi
 is par nigam ne avaidh rup se bane kareeb 8,000 makaanon ko sil karke giraane kii kavayad shuru kar di
 But the BJP gave the issue a political color
 maamle ko tool pakadta dekh centre sarkaar ne dilli vishesh praavdhaan adhinium, 2006 naam se kanoon banaakar avaidh nirmaanon ko sangrakshan pradaan kar diya
 Although the Central Government had moved the Supreme Court before enacting the law, the then Chief Justice Y
 ke
 Sabharwal had reprimanded the Central Government for how the law could declare wrong things as right
 ukt adhinium ko 2006 main lagu kar diya gaya jiske tahat ek saal ke liye disambar, 2005 se pehle ke avaidh nirmaan ke khilaaf karrwai par roak laga di gai thi
 It is known that Laxminagar is one of the 567 colonies that were regularized by the Delhi government even after being illegal
 abhi 1,639 avaidh coloniyaan or hai, jo niyamit hone kaa intjaar kar rahi hai
 Delhi has a large population of people from outside, who play an important role during the assembly and Lok Sabha elections, so no political party wants to mess with it
 vaise, is aabaadi kii jaan kii parvaah kisi ko nahin he
 According to the Municipal Corporation, out of 30 lakh properties in Delhi, only 5,589 are illegal
 15 november ko purvi dilli ke lalita park ilaake main jis imaarat ne kai begunaahon kii jindagi leel lee thi, nigam ke mutabik vah avaidh nahin thi
 The Zamindoz building had only one room in the year 1971, which now took the form of a huge building
 lalita park kaa haadasa ho yaa palam main imaarat ke jhuk jane kaa yaa phir gat maheene purvi dilli ke osmanpur main imaarat girane kaa, inamen se kisi bhi imaarat ko nigam ke bhawan vibhaag ne avaidh nirmaan kii suchi main nahin daalaa tha
 The story of all these buildings is quite amazing
 lalita park main dhahi imaarat kaa maalik amritpal nigam ko ek kamare kaa hi sampatti kar adaa karata tha
 The corporation does not have any record of the construction work done in this building
 aisa hi haal nigam ke sabhi 12 jone kaa he
 There are 437 illegal properties in Karol Bagh zone
 isi tarah, sadar-pahadganj jone main 243, city jone main 44, rohinee main 393, shahdara-uttari jone main 387, south jone main 659, narela jone main 490, central jone main 311, shahdara-dakshin jone main 1,016, najafagarh main 401, pashchimi jone main 1,024 or civil lines jone main 184 avaidh sampattiyaan hai
 The survey of the government was done only in the Laxminagar area because the accident happened here
 magar vah shaayad okhla ilaake ko bhul gai he, jahaan avaidh or betaratib dhang se bani imaaraton kii neenv bhi daldal main he
 Hundreds of buildings at Jogabai Extension, Zakiranagar, Batla House, Sailing Club, Dhobi Ghat, Abul Fazal Enclave and Shaheen Bagh are in the same condition as the buildings in East Delhi
 sarkari agency chaahe didie ho, emsidi yaa phir dilli police, in sabhi kii nigahen kitni paini hai,yadi kisi ko aajmaana ho to vah apane ghar ke baahar ek trek eent or ek theli badarpur girava ke dekh le
 Within a few hours the police of the area, the engineers of the corporation will reach there to take their part
 haadase hote hai, nirdosh log marate hai, sarkari agenciyaan ek-duusare par doshaaropan karti hai, jaanch or carrravai kii ghoshnaa hoti he, or is tarah kar di jaati he rasm adaayagi
 At least this has happened till now
 lagata nahin ki lalita park imaarat haadasa dilli ke liye sabak ban paaegaa
 Then there will be an accident, there will be announcements of action against the culprits, but the situation will change, perhaps even the top leaders and bureaucrats sitting in the government do not trust it
 centre sarkaar ne sena ke major aditya ke samarthan main arji daakhil kii he
 The central government said that the Jammu and Kashmir government did not have the right to register an FIR against the army officer without the permission of the central government
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki is vishay par gahan vichaar kiya gaya or ye paaya ki centre sarkaar kii ijaajat ke bina rajya sarkaar is maamle main koi bhi aapraadhik karrwai sena ke afasar ke khilaaf nahin kar sakati
 The state government has not taken any permission from the central government in this matter
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki jammu kashmir main aatankwaadi or desh virdohi takatein kanoon kaa ulanghan kar rahi hai isse suraksha vyavastha prabhavit hoti he
 Such people also have modern weapons and have the support of countries across the border
 jo police or suraksha bal unka virodh karte hai unpar hamale ho rahe hai
 In order to maintain the security and unity of the country in the interest of the nation, it is necessary to explain section 7 of AFPSA, which protects the army
 is sambandh main supreme court ke do alag alag virodhabhasi faisle hai jinke liye badi bench kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 The investigation of this case should not go ahead and further action of the FIR should be stopped
 haalanki supreme court pehle hi FIR par jaanch par roak laga chukaa he
 The Supreme Court said that the state police will not investigate in this matter till April 24 at present
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court will hold the final hearing of the case on 24 April
 chif justise ne kaha ki ye maamla sena ke adhikari kaa he, kisi saamaanya apradhi kaa nahin
 The Jammu and Kashmir government said in the Supreme Court that the name of Major Aditya is not an accused in the FIR
 sirf ye likhaa gaya he ki wo batalian ko lead kar kar rahe the
 Court asked what name will be taken? The state government said that it depends on the investigation
 court ko maamle kii jaanch jari rakhane kii ijaajat deni chahie
 During the hearing, the central and state governments appeared face to face in this matter
 AG ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki AFPSA kii dhara 7 ke tahat rajya sarkaar is tarah FIR darj nahin kar sakati
 For this, it is necessary to get the permission of the Center, while the state government opposed it
 kaha ki FIR darj karte vakt isaki jarurat nahin he
 The Supreme Court will now decide whether this FIR is valid or not
 is maamle main rajya sarkaar ne centre sarkaar se koi ijaajat nahin lee he
 The central government said that militant and anti-national forces are violating the law in Jammu and Kashmir, this affects the security system
 aise logon ke paas aadhunik hathiyaar bhi hai or unhen seemaa paar ke deshon kaa samarthan bhi he
 Police and security forces who oppose them are under attack
 deshhit main desh kii suraksha or ekta ko banane rakhane ke liye sena ko suraksha dene vaale AFPSA ke dhara 7 kii vyakhya kerani jaruri he
 There are two different contradictory decisions of the Supreme Court in this regard for which a large bench should be formed
 is maamle kii jaanch aage nahin honi chahie or FIR kii aage kii karrwai par roak lagani chahie
 However, the Supreme Court has already stayed the investigation on the FIR
 supreme court ne kaha ki is maamle main rajya police philhal 24 april tak jaanch nahin karegi
 The comments supreme court 24 april ko maamle kii antim sunwaayee karegaa
 The Chief Justice said that the matter is of army officer and not of any common criminal
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki major aditya kaa naam FIR main bataur aaropee nahin he
 It has been written that he was leading the battalion
 court ne poocha kya naam liya jayega? rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki ye jaanch par nirbhar karata he
 The court should allow the case to continue to be investigated
 vahiin sunwaayee ke dauraan centre or rajya sarkaar is maamle main aamane saamne dikhe
 ag's k Venugopal said that under Section 7 of AFPSA, the state government cannot register an FIR like this
 iske liye centre kii anumati lenaa jaruri he, vahiin rajya sarkaar ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Said that it is not needed while filing an FIR
 supreme court ab ye tay karegaa ki ye FIR vaid he yaa nahin

 But this time due to heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh, the surge in the Narmada river has submerged this dam to its capacity
 ab sardaar sarovar baandh kaa jalastr 138
 Has reached 68 m
 baandh banakar puraa hone ke baad iskaa udghaatan bhi pradhanmantri ne apane janmdin ke maukey par karke desh ko tohfa diya tha
 The Sardar Sarovar Dam is the largest dam in India and the second largest in the world
 is baandh se pariyojna se gujarat, madhya pradesh, maharashtra or rajasthan chaar rajyon ko bijli or pine kaa pani muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 The Lifeline of Gujarat, Sardar Sarovar Dam is also known as the Lifeline of Gujarat, because the water of Sardar Sarovar is transported through canal to the last village of Kutch in Gujarat
 sardaar sarovar se gujarat ke 131 shaharon or 9633 gaanvon main nahar ke jariye pani pahunchaaya jaataa he
 For this, a 75000 km network of 457 canals is spread all over Gujarat
 baandh ke puri tarah bharne ke baad 18 lakh hectare jameen kii sinchai ke liye pani uplabdh ho paaegaa
 In the coming two years, Gujarat will also have to supply drinking water through Sardar Sarovar
 sardaar sarovar pariyojna ke emdi dow
 Rajiv Gupta said that this is the first time the water in Sardar Sarovar has reached the historical level of its highest potential
 ab is baandh main 24 ghante bijli paidaa kii ja rahi he
 At present 1450 mega votes of electricity is being produced from this dam

 Narmada river is in spate due to heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh

 The first Prime Minister of the country had laid the foundation, the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation of Sardar Sarovar Project on 5 April 1961
 is pariyojna ke puraa hone ke liye 56 saalon kaa lanbaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 It is the longest project in the country that lasted the longest and started in 1961 and was completed in 2017
 narmada nadi par kul 30 chote bade baandhon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Sardar Sarovar is one of them
 sardaar sarovar pariyojna shuru hone ke baad iske nirmaan ke saath saath iske khilaaf nirantar sangharsh bhi chalata rahaa
 a large population which was being displaced by this dam, came down on protest

 Due to this, its work kept getting stuck again and again
 madhya pradesh ke 190 se adhik gaanv dubenarmada nadi mukhyat madhya pradesh main bahati he
 The flow of Narmada is 1312 km in Madhya Pradesh and only 160 km in Gujarat
 nadi ke kul jalgrahan kshetra kaa lagbhag 85 fisadi madhya pradesh main hai
 Therefore, Madhya Pradesh will have to pay the maximum cost of construction of Sardar Sarovar Dam
 narmada ghati sthit dhar, badvani, sahit anya jilon ke 190 se adhik gaanv pani main dub gayi hai
 Since Madhya Pradesh had more losses than this dam, Madhya Pradesh has been given more benefit in power generation
 kul bijli utpaadan main se madhya pradesh ko 57 fisadi, maharashtra ko 27 fisadi or gujarat ko 18 fisadi bijli milti he
 In December 1993, the Union Ministry of Forests and Environment stated that the Sardar Sarovar Project did not follow environmental regulations
 iske baad janvari 1994 main janata ke baari virodh ko dekhte hue pariyojna kaa kaam roka gaya
 In 1994, the World Bank said in its report that rehabilitation work is not being done properly in the Sardar Sarovar Project

 In Chhattisgarh, notes worth crores of Naxalites were buried under the forest
 naksaliyon ne bharpoor koshish kii ki ye rakam jandhan or bachat khaaton main jamaa ho jaae
 Somewhere at the tip of the gun, the Naxalites tricked the villagers a lot, but the people listened to them with one ear and removed them from the other
 haalanki kai graminon or vyapaariyon ne naksaliyon ke dabaav main aa kar kuch rakam bainko main jamaa bhi kii lekin is koshish main kai police kii giraft main bhi aaye
 Police claim that about one and a half crores of Naxalites got into the hundred crore soil
 chhattisgarh police mukhyalay ko bheji gai gopneey report main is rakam kaa hawala diya gaya he
 The police and central security forces are hopeful that a stampede situation will prevail in the Naxalites in the coming days
 notebandi kaa daur khatm hote hi chhattisgarh ke naksal prabhavit ilaakon main bainko ke karmchaariyon or police ne raahat kii saans lee he
 Due to demonetisation, a large batch of 500 and 1000 notes of Naxalites could not get out of the forests
 police kaa daawa he ki chhattisgarh main naksaliyon kaa lagbhag saadhe baarah sau karod rupaya mitti main mil gaya
 The Naxalites tried hard to withdraw this amount but they could not succeed
 police ke mutabik unki force ke saath CRPF , ITBP , BSF or DRG ke javaanon ke behatar talmail se naksalwad kii qamar tut gayi he
 The huge amount of Naxalites remained hidden within the forest
 police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon ne durgam jangalo ke bheetar daakhil ho kar naksaliyon ke daant khattey kar die
 Due to regular patrolling and search operation, the Naxalites could not get a chance to withdraw their deposits
 notebandi ke aakhri din police ne bainko ke afasaron se feedback liya or unki is baat ke liye peeth thapthapai kii wo naksaliyon ke dabaav main nahin aae
 According to Durg Range IG Dipanshu Kabra, demonetisation had a major impact on Maoists
 ek to wo apane damp nikaal nahin paae
 He was able to deposit very little money in the Jan Dhan accounts through the villagers
 aise khaaton ko fries karaayaa ja chukaa he or kai graminon ko sandesh bhejkar iske parinaam kii jaankaree di gai jiske chalate kaaphi logon ne unke paise jamaa karne se manaa bhi kar diya
 In such a situation, it is clear that the Naxalites may have to face the financial crisis soon
 chhattisgarh se sate maharashtra, madhyapradesh, jharkhand, telugana or andhrapradesh kii sarhad par vaahanon kii niyamit checking or combing gasht ke chalate notebandi ke 8 navambar se 30 disambar ke bich kareeb do darjan logon se police ne dhai karod kii rakam baraamad kii he
 The highest amount of this was about 125 million recovered from Bastar
 jabaki rajanandgaanv, durg divijan or ambikapur divijan se isi avadhi main ek karod das lakh rupaye baraamad hue
 According to the police, the people from whom this money has been recovered could neither inform them nor the income tax department about the source of income
 notebandi kaa daur khatm hone ke baad police ne ab aise logon ko dubaara poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa he
 Not only this, two dozen teams have been formed by the police to check the accounts of Jan Dhan in Bastar, Kanker, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Rajnandgaon, Balod and Narayanpur
 abhi tak iskar vibhaag hi in khaaton ko khangaalane main juta tha
 The police suspect that the Naxalites had entrusted the responsibility of converting their money to some of the white villagers, besides the common villagers, to throw dust in their eyes
 iske liye unhen bada kamishan bhi diya gaya
 As soon as the demonetisation phase is over in the Naxal-affected areas of Chhattisgarh, the police have started increasing the pressure on those who raise their hands to help the Naxalites
 police ne maanav adhikaron kii vakaalat karne waalon ke alaava un vyapaariyon kaa kaala chittha ikaitha karnaa shuru kar diya he jo aarthik rup se naksalwad kii jade majboot karne main jute hue the
 The police has assured the villagers that Naxalism will not be able to spread its foot for long even now due to demonetisation

 After the recent joining of BJP by the TDP and INLD mps in the Rajya Sabha and the resignation of Congress and JDS mlas in Karnataka, the Congress legislators in Goa now join the BJP, once on the usefulness of the 35-year-old defection law Then questions have arisen
 desh ke sheersh samvidhanvid subhash kashyap to is kanoon ko samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke vipareet maanate huye ise khatm karne ke pakshdhar hai
 Subhash Kashyap has answered questions on this issue
 jawaab : dalbadal kanoon ko samvidhan se alag karke nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 Its utility or the need to improve it, are subjects which can be considered only in the context of the existing system of political parties and the politics of the country
 saath hi is sachai ko bhi sweekaar karnaa hoga ki hamaare raajnneetik dalon kii vyavastha kisi siddhant, aarthik niti yaa raajnneetik kaarykram par aadhaarit nahin he
 In a country where more than 2000 parties focused on individuals, families or castes are part of the election process, it is inconsistent to consider the defection law without taking into account the truth of the party system in that country
 jawaab: dalbadal kanoon ke asar athwa kharid farokht rokane main kamyaabi ko samajhane ke liye is kanoon kii upyogita ko jaananaa jaruri he
 There are two opinions about this
 pehla mat kahata he ki samvidhan, sadan ke sadasyon ko sadan or uski samitiyon main matdaan evam abhivyakti kii puri swatantraaa kii guarantee detaa he
 Any obstacle to this guarantee is against the constitution and also the violation of parliamentary privileges
 vahiin, dal ke aadesh ke vipareet matdaan karne athwa party line se hatakar bolne se rokane vaala dalbadal kanoon, samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke bilkul vipareet he
 The second view is that after 1967, many governments collapsed due to the defection of legislators in the greed for the post of minister or money
 ek sadsy dwaara maheene bhar main paanch dal badalane tak ke udhaaharan jab saamne aaye tab sarkaron kii sthirataa kii khatir is kanoon kii jarurat mahasoos kii gayi
 Incidents of defection increased sharply in the last 35 years following the enactment of the anti-defection law that disqualified a member from the party line
 itnaa hi nahin is kanoon ke tahat sadsyta bachaane ke liye dal main vibhaajan yaa do guton ke vilay ke praavdhaan ne vyaktigat dalbadal ke bajaay samuhik dalbadal kaa rasta prashast kar diya
 This automatically conceives the success of the law
 jawaab: isamen pehle yah dekhnaa hoga ki aap saansad yaa vidhayak ko janata kaa pratinidhi maanate hai yaa raajnneetik dal kaa pratinidhi maanate hai
 The second thing is that for the success of parliamentary democracy, having a stable and strong government is absolutely necessary
 lekin ek prabhavi pratipaksh bhi utana hi aavashyak he
 Parliamentary democracy cannot succeed without it
 isamen vipaksh kaa sankhyabal mahatvapurn nahin he balki uskaa prabhavi hona jaruri he
 In the first three to four Lok Sabha, the opposition was not high in strength but was very effective
 jabaki pichhali teen chaar loksabhaaon main pratipaksh ne sadan bhale hi chalane na diya ho lekin use prabhavi vipaksh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In such a situation, instead of discussing the impact of the law, it is necessary that all political parties that have become mere medium of power struggle should consider their effective significance and are governed by theoretical commitment
 kanoon kii apni simaayen hai, kanoon kisi ko naitik rup se patibaddh nahin banaata he
 Answer: What is happening in Karnataka is by far the most evil face of Indian politics and Indian democracy
 isaki jitani bhartsana kii jaye vah kam he
 All parties are guilty for this
 beshak, vidhansabha adhyaksh kii bhoomika sawaalon ke ghere main he
 The role of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly is like a quasi-judicial body in defection law
 yah sahi he ki kanoon main aise kisi maamle ke nistaaran ke liye samaysima niyat nahi he
 It may be considered a drawback of the law, but the dignity of the post of the Speaker is such that the more it binds in the law, the less will be the dignity of the post
 adhyaksh pad par baithe vyakti se yah apeksha nahin kii ja sakati he ki vah anaavashyak vilamb karegaa
 The only person expected to follow the constitution and the law is to move away from the interests of the party to occupy constitutional positions
 uttar pradesh ke noida main saarvajanik park main bagaiyr sarkari anumati ke jume kii saptahik namaaj padhane par paabandi lagane or aisa hone par vahaan kii nijee companiyon par karrwai karne ke naye sarkari farmaan ko bispi pramukh mayawati ne buudhvaar ko galat or ekatarfa karrwai bataaya he
 Mayawati questioned in a statement, "if the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh has a policy of banning religious activities in public places, then it is strictly on the people of all religions equally and in every district of the whole state, everywhere Why is it not being implemented without any discrimination? "reacting to the latest incident in Noida, Mayawati said that if the site was not occupied since February 2013, Aj continues to have now what it means to impose restrictions on the election? He asked why this action was not done before and now why such action is being taken before the Lok Sabha elections? Threat of action, irresponsible Kadam Mayawati said that this would point fingers at both the BJP government's intention and policy and religious It is natural to be accused of discrimination
 unhone kaha ki saath hi yah ashanka bhi prabal hoti he ki chunaav ke samay is prakaar ke dharmik vivaadon ko paidaa kar bijepi sarkaar apni kamiyon or vifaltaaon par se logon kaa dhyaan baantnaa chaahati he
 Sending police notices to several private companies located in Noida Sector-58 regarding the Namaz of Jume, threatening action on them is completely wrong and irresponsible
 bispi pramukh ne kaha ki sarkaar kii aisi karrwai se saaf he ki haal main paanch rajyon main huye vidhansabha chunaavon main hui karaari haar se bijepi ke senior leader kitna ghabaraaye hue hai tathaa usee hataasha or niraashaa se galat tathaa visangatipurna faisle le rahe hai
 Not only Uttar Pradesh but also the BJP government at the Center, every work is going to spoil the communal harmony by increasing religious frenzy so that the attention of the people can be shared with the opponents
 kya he puraa maamladansal, 19 disambar ko sector-58 ke park main namaaj padhane par nauman akhtar samet do logon ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya gaya tha
 Both came out on bail on Saturday
 police kaa kahana he ki ye donon jabaran park main namaaj padhanaa chaahate the, jo ki kanoon kaa ulanghan he
 The police had said in its order that companies present here should inform their employees about this order
 agar dobaaraa koi vyakti park main namaaj padhata hua paaya gaya, to isaki jimmedaari company kii hogi
 It is worth mentioning that earlier a similar order was issued on Namaz in the open in Gurugram, Haryana
 iske alaava kuch hindu sanghathanon ne bhi khule main namaaj padhe jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The poster of Anurag Kashyap's upcoming film 'bombay Velvet' has been released

 While Ranbir Kapoor is playing Johnny in the film, Anushka's character is Rosie who is a singer
 film ke poster par likhaa he, 'smart to saalaa mumbai main pair rakhte hi sab ho jaataa he'
 This dialogue of the film tells that Johnny, the main character of the film, is a boy from outside Mumbai who has come to Mumbai to fulfill his dreams
 is film main ranbir, anoushka ke alaave karan johar, keke menon, vivaan shah, manish choudhary, siddharth basu or ravina tandon bhi najar aaenge
 The funny thing is that Karan Johar will be seen in the role of Villain in this film

Pakistan cricket team wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed has said that he could never disclose his problems while Waqar Younis was the head coach as he feared being out of the team

 So he answered yes
 tii20 team ke captain sarfaraj ne aage kaha, ‘main thodaa asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa tha kyonki acha pradarshan karne ke baavjood zimbabwe daure se pehle aakhri tii20 mukaable se mujhe baahar kar diya gaya tha or mujhe is baat ki chintaa thi ki yadi mere sthaan par chunaa gaya khilaadi acha pradarshan karata he to phir kya hoga
 'when Sarfaraz was told that he is currently the best wicketkeeper from the team and was asked that you are consistently doing well then why feel insecure
 is par unhone ghuma firaakar jawaab diya
 But when Sarfaraz was asked about the events of the World Cup 2015 played in New Zealand and Australia when Waqar did not feed him in the first four matches despite pressure from the people, he tried not to give much attention to the matter
 unhone kaha, ‘main zyada kehane se darataa hum
 This can exclude me
 mujhe team se baahar kiye jane kaa dar rahata he kyonki kuch anya khilaadiyon ke saath jo kuch hua uskaa main gavaah rahaa hum

 How five people go out to search for Osama of India without weapons, how successful they are, this mission is shown in the film's story
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath shapath lene vaale 57 mantriyon ke naam par gaur karne se pataa chalata he ki list taiyaar karte vakt soshal ejineering kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Efforts have been made to promote effective ethnic groups in states
 bijepi ne yah koshish he ki uskaa kor voter khush rahe
 This is the reason why the BJP has given more opportunities to the faces coming from those castes, which are considered its core voters
 aisa bhi nahin he ki sabhi mantriyon ke naam jaateey samikarnon kii vajah se hi final hue, magar itnaa jarur he ki adhikansh mantriyon ko is vajah se hi mantriparishad main shaamil hone kaa mauka mila

 At the same time Dalits have been given participation by making Ram Vilas Paswan a minister from Bihar
 haalanki bihar main ek badi taadaad main maujuud gaiyr yadav pichhadaa varg se koi mantri nahin bana he
 It is believed that one or two of these names were to come from Nitish's quota, but this category could not get representation due to JDU not joining the government
 vahiin mantri bane ravishankar prasad, giriraaj singh, ashvini choube, aarake singh agadi jatiyon se hai

 com / kod7lbtpfz In 2014, Narendra Modi, one of the most successful politicians of Gujarat, came to power at the Center
 wo pradhanmantri bane
 Earlier, during the Lok Sabha election campaign, Modi wandered across the country and made corruption of the Congress-led UPA government the biggest weapon
 saath hi saath congress mukt bharat banane kaa sankalp liya
 Modi and his team also got to taste success from year to year on this mission
 jeet kaa jo silsilaa 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav se shuru hua, wo 2017 aate-aate rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi bijepi ke liye jashn kaa mauka lekar aayaa
 However, this year has been somewhat life-threatening for the Congress as well
 vahiin samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, shiromani akali dal jaise kshetreey dalon ke liye kaaphi feekaa rahaa
 In 2017, a total of seven state assembly elections were held and 5 states witnessed a change of power, while in two states Gujarat and Goa, BJP repatriated the government while saving power
 in chunaavon ne vidhansabha siton kaa ganit bhi badal diya

 bijepi kii aisi lahar chali ki donon pramukh partiyaan samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party dharaashai ho gayi
 In 2012, the Samajwadi Party, which came to government with an absolute majority, was reduced to just 47 seats out of 403 in 2017
 vahiin jis bahujan samaaj party ne 2007 main purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaakar itihaas rachaa tha, wo sirf 19 siton par hi jeet saki
 Mathematics of UP Assembly seats in 2017 Bharatiya Janata Party- 312 (2012-47) Samajwadi Party - 47 (2012-224) Bahujan Samaj Party -19 (2012-80) Congress-07 (2012-28) Rashtriya Lok Dal-01 (2012- 09) Apna Dal - 09 (2012-0) Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party -04 (2012-0) 2

 Goa - In terms of tourism, there was a lot of political warmth after the election amid the famous sea waves of Goa
 kul 40 siton vaali choti vidhansabha ke jab nattejey aae to congress ko sabase zyada 17 siton par jeet mili
 But no party got the magic figure to form the government
 nateeja ye hua ki 13 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ne nirdaleey or duusare chote dalon ke vijayi pratyaashiyon ko saath laakar sarkaar banaai

 manipur- uttar-purv ke is rajya main bhi bijepi ne goa jaisi trick apanaai
 However, in this 60-seat assembly election, the public trusted the Congress the most and won 28 seats, but in 2012, a negligible BJP formed the government despite winning 21 seats in the state's politics

 If the trend so far changes in the results, then no single party in Haryana will be in a position to form the government
 or yah bhi lagbhag tay ho gaya he ki haryana main dushyant chautaala ke bagaiyr kisi kii sarkaar bhi nahin ban paaegi
 After the rise in the trends, the Congress has started correcting the political equation from now on
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki congress ke varisht netaa dushyant chautaala ke sampark main bane hue hai
 However, Dushyant Chautala said in a special conversation with NDTV India that no government can be formed in the state without him
 udhar, jejepi ke netaa dushyant chautaala ke anusaar unki party is baar haryana (haryana Election) main nai sarkaar banane main badi bhoomika nibhaayegi
 According to information received from the sources, the Congress has started trying to form the government in Haryana and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala has been offered the post of deputy CM on behalf of the party
 lekin chautaala siem pad ke liye ade hue hai
 It is being told that on Wednesday, Dushyant met between Chautala and Deepender Hooda
 haalanki bijepi bhi dushyant chautaala ko apane paale main laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Congress will now have to decide whether it will be ready to make Dushyant Chautala the CM to keep the BJP away from power
 lekin yah congress ke liye faisla aasaan nahin hoga or kyonki bhupendra singh hooda jinhone haryana main congress ke liye jamkar mehnat kii he or vah sarkaar main shaamil na hon or agar vah shaamil hon to dushyant chautaala se junior banakar kaam karen
 However, it may take a little longer to clear the picture in Haryana
 lekin yah vishleshan ke liye he ki haryana jaise rajya jahaan bahut badi sankhya main sena or surakshabal main kaam karte hai, kya un par bhi jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa bahut zyada asar nahin hua he or isi ke dam par bijepi daawa kar rahi thi ki use rajya main 75 siten zyada milengi

 97 karod rupee kamaaye, jiske chalate film kaa collection 74
 08 crores remained
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ek hafte main itani kamai karne vaali yah bharat main relies hollywood filmon main pehali film he
 By the way, 'the Jungle Book' is based on the stories of famous writer 'rudyard Kipling' and a film has been made in this subject in the 60s and in India this series was also shown on 'doordarshan'
 is baar diarector jon fevaru ne behtareen andaaj main anemated flavor janata tak pahunchane kii koshish kii he
 Handwriting has been screened 100 percent, cinematography, animation and VFX are of a high standard
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle soobe kii puri siyasat teen yuvaaon par aakar tik gai he
 There is also a legitimate reason behind this, because they are not just three youths, but they also have the support of the three big castes of the state
 yahi vajah he ki patel netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ke virdohi swaron se bijepi baikfoot par najar aa rahi he, vahiin congress in teenon ko saath lekar 22 saal ke siyaasi sookhe ko khatm karne kii bharpoor koshish kar rahi he
 The Congress is so serious about these three young leaders that it is seen forgetting its traditional voters
 rajya main kareeb 10 fisadi musalmaan aabaadi he, magar congress or rahul gandhi ke prachaar main ab tak inkaa zikr tak nahin kiya gaya he
 Not only this, in the current elections, the Muslim Congress agenda also seems diverted
 pradesh congress ke netaaon main bhi is baat ko lekar chintaa he
 Aajtak by Badruddin Sheikh, senior leader of Gujarat Congress
 in se baatcheet main ahm jaankaree di he
 He has said that the Congress wants to change its image by keeping distance from Muslims
 hindutv kii taraf congressbadaruddin shaikh ne bataaya ki bijepi hameshaa ye prachaarit karti he ki muslim voter congress ke saath hai
 According to Sheikh, 'congress is trying to wash away this image this time
 yahi vajah he ki rahul gandhi jab gujarat daure par pahunche to unhone mandir jaakar bhagwaan ke darshan bhi kiye'
 Congress leader Badruddin has made another important disclosure
 unhone bataaya ki har chunaav main congress jamiyat ulema or jamaat-e islamic jaise islamic sanghathanon ko bulaakar chunaav main samarthan kii apil karti thi
 But this time it has not been done yet
 shaikh ke mutabik, 'maine party se khud is baat kii guzarish kii he, magar party kii taraf se ab tak kisi sanghathan ko baatcheet ke liye aamantrit nahin kiya gaya he'
 On the one hand, while Congress leaders are claiming to ignore Muslims on their own party, on the other hand, famous businessman of Gujarat Zafar Sareshwala, who is considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has also made a serious accusation against the Congress
 sareshwala ke mutabik congress ye maanakar chalati he ki muslim vot unke alaava kisi or ko nahin jayega
 This is the reason why Congress is ignoring Muslims
 darasal, jamini hakeekat dekhen to aisa saaf najar aa rahaa he
 When Rahul Gandhi visited Gujarat, he went to Dwarkadhish Temple
 jahaan unhone na sirf mattha teka, balki wo tilak lagaakar bhaashan dete hue bhi najar aae
 The second important thing is that the Congress is focusing more on these three youths because they are more than Muslims in the percentage of votes
 saath hi gujarat dangon ke baad congress sonia gandhi ke maut kaa saudagar jaise bayaan bhi unke khilaaf gaye hai
 This is the reason why the Congress is making a ruckus, and the speeches and agenda of its leaders make the Muslims look lost

 dakshin africa ke chotil tej gendbaaj del sten bharat ke khilaaf shanivaar se shuru ho rahe duusare cricket test se baahar ho gaye hai
 Earlier on Thursday, fast bowler Vernon Philander was also ruled out of the remaining series due to an injury to his left ankle
 sten ko mohali main pehle test ke dauraan groin main chot lagi thi jisase vah puri tarah se ubarne main naakaam rahe hai
 South Africa captain Hashim Amalane said before the net practice at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, "of course, losing the world's best bowler, Dale Stan and possibly the world's best all-rounder Vernon, definitely changes the balance of the team
 ’ mohali main pehle test ke dauraan groin kii mansapeshiyon main jakadane ke kaaran sten ne duusari pari main gendbaaji nahin kii thi
 Amla, however, hoped that Steyn would recover from the injury until the third Test starting in Nagpur on 25 November
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe ummid he ki sten nagpur main hone vaale tisare test tak ubar jaaenge
 Cricket South Africa has included Kyle Abbott as a substitute for Philander
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main amala ne kaha ki eboat chotil sten kii jagah le sakate hai
 Amla said, "even if Vernon was playing, we know that we have three tier spinners
 isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki yah adhik myne rakhata he
 Vernon's ankle was hurt yesterday and such things happen
 kabhi kabhi is tarah kii sthiti se aapke liye pariktha jaisi kahani ban jaati he
 In response to the question of who will replace Stan and Philander, Amla said, "the players who will replace him will be level players
" ham bhaagyashaalee hai ki hamaari gendbaaji main kaaphi gaharaai he
 If you want to win a Test series, then usually the series is won with 15 players, not just 11 players
 haalanki abhi siries kii shuruyaat he, mujhe ab bhi lagata he ki vikalp ke taur par hamaare paas prabhavi akraman he
 'there is good news for South Africa though
 ballebaaji alrounder jepi dumini ne fitness test paas kar liya he
 The left-handed all-rounder Rajkot has recovered from a finger injury while trying to catch his own ball in the ODI match
 dumini ko spin kaa kaaphi acha ballebaaji mana jaataa he or unki vaapasi se dakshin africa ke madhyakram ko majbootee milegi
 In the context of Abbott, Amla said that he is similar to Philander and that South Africa have had great reserve bowlers over the years
 unhone kaha, ‘haa, vah taiyaar he
 Abbott has been a great reserve bowler for us over the years
 sabhi praroopon main use jab bhi mauka mila usne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 He is just like Vernon, he can bowl continuously from the same line and length
 uskaa apni gendbaaji par niyantran he
 ' hamaara samaaj vah nahin he jo hamen dikhataa he
 This is not what our leaders show
 balki jaisaa dikhataa he, uske neeche pyaaj kii kai paraton kii tarah kai samaaj khulte jate hai
 Famous litterateur Bhalchandra Joshi has opened our closing eyes on that opening society
 unka upanyaas 'jas kaa phool' samasamyik mudde ko uthaakar likhi gai ek behtareen kriti he
 In a period in which nationalism has become the frenzy of the majority, the period in which history measures nationality and patriotism by the population of religion, in a period when minority and Muslim among them becomes another name for dubious allegiance, in that era novel The flower gives us two eyes to read our society
 yah upanyaas kisi nayak yaa nayika kii kahani nahin balki hamaare aapke mohalle main rahane vaale naujavaanon kii manovyatha, unki aawaargi, unki kuntha, unke santras, unki bechaini or berogari ke alam main samay kii dhara main khud ko nidhaal chhod dene kii kahani he
 The novelist has named his novel an Abhod Prem Katha, but this novel takes a pinch on the downturn of our society
 is upanyaas main joshi ne kahin bhi kisi ko nayak yaa khalanaayak nahin dikhaaya he
 He shows how circumstances make the same human being a villain, sometimes a jester or sometimes a hero
 upanyaas kaa mukhya paatr shahrukh or kaajol hai
 You do not know when these film names move from the background to the center stage

 And it has also told how educated, elitist and claiming to give direction to the society, the messiah could not move an inch ahead of his orthodox thinking
 marks ne kabhi dharm ko opium kaha tha
 How the society that sniffed that opium immersed their centuries of relationships in rumors of bitterness is described in this novel very slowly
 'jas kaa phool' naam ek nishchal or eemaandaar pyaar ko mila sabase bada inaam he
 Surely this novel is worth reading, so that we can understand all the societies that occur inside us, its metaphors, its rebellions, its goodness
 lekhak peshey se ejeeniyar hai, lekin ye upanyaas bataata he ki wo jadta ke kam, chetanta ke ejeeniyar zyada hai

 ayog ne apane aadesh main kaha, ‘ayog aapaki uparokt karrwai par apni kadi asahmati jaahir karata he or aapako aagaah karata he ki aap bhavishya main saavdhaanee baraten
 The Commission said in its order that the Minister's statement that the number of subsidized cylinders will be increased is like a declaration of financial assistance and is a clear violation of the spirit of the Model Election Code of Conduct
 ayog ne kaha ki is tarah ke bayaan kaa gujarat ke matadaataaon ke man par prabhaav pad saktaa he jahaan 13 or 17 disambar ko vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Significantly, the commission had taken suo motu cognizance of Moily's announcement in which he had stated that the government would increase the number of subsidized LPG cylinders from the current six cylinders per family to nine
 chunaav ayog ne petroleum evam prakritik gas mantralay tathaa mantri ko do alag-alag patr bheje
 The Commission directed the Ministry to immediately stop any action being taken to increase the number of subsidized LPG cylinders

 The coal mine allocation file is knocking in the PMO and the case is going on in the Supreme Court, in fact, the first information was revealed through the RTI, how the coal mines were divided into monsoons at such a paltry price
 
 sirf koyala khadaan hi nahin manaregaa se lekar rashan dukaanon se bipiel pariwaron ko milane vaale khadaan kii lut se lekar petrol ke milawat or sarkari yojanaon main lut kii saukadon jaankaree artiai se hi nikali
 And after all this information, even if the scams of scams did not subside, there was a fear in everyone that his mess could be revealed under RTI today or not tomorrow
 jaahir he iskaa shres baar-baar sonia gandhi se lekar manmohan sarkaar ke har kaddavar mantri ne liya bhi or desh ko ginaya bhi
 That is, no political party has ever said before that - RTI is not benefiting the country
 -artiai se galat jaankaree saamne aati he
 Or else the RTI is making the government difficult to function
 sawaal he jab isse pehle har vakt artiai kaa gungan hi kiya gaya to phir aisa kya he ki raajnneetik dalon ko jaise hi artiai ke daayre main laane ko kaha gaya to ek sire se sabhi ke ek hi sur ho gayi or lage sabhi virodh karne
 The question is that the RTI Act which exposed many scamsters in the country, the Right to Information Act has masked the face of dozens of corrupt people in the country, why should the political leaders also be allowed to bring political parties under the same law Is not it? Have political parties started to feel the danger that the funds that reach them for the elections, after coming under the purview of RTI, along with the donors After coming to Tta can open their relations pole bar
 yaa phir raajnneetik dal loktantric vyavastha kaa naam lekar jis tarah- chande ke naam har kaali kamai ko pachaa lete he yaa- netaaon kii shahkharchi kaa koi hisaab kitaab nahin hotaavah sab saamne aa jaayegaa
 Therefore, it is to be believed that on the orders of the Central Information Commission to bring political parties under the purview of the RTI Act, the snakes have been snuffed out to political parties
 raajnneetik partiyon kii kamai ko koi hisaab nahindesh ke top 10 raajnneetik dalon ke paas chande ke taur par har baras sava lakh karod se zyada kii raashi aati he
 But who gives this money and what they get from this, what political parties get in return for this donation, it is still in suspense
 jabaki darjanon artiai har raajnneetik dal ke daftar main yah jaanane ke liye lagaayi gayi lekin kabhi koi jaankaree nikal kar nahin aayi
 The information that came out during the tax filing of political parties
 vah rakam bhi itani zyada he ki ellection vaach naamak sanstha ne usapar bhi oongli uthaayi, lekin haath kuch bhi nahin aayaa
 This amount can be understood from the earnings of political parties from 2009 to 2011
 masalan congress kii kamai 77,467 karod rahi to bijepi kii kamai 42,602 karod rupee or sipiem kii kamai 14,985 karod rahi
 The special thing is that the person who stays in power does not earn only from donations
 lekin duusare koun se raste hote hai isapar raajnneetik dal khamosh ho jate hai
 For example, between 2009-2011, the Congress got only 14 per cent donations
 lekin bijepi ko 80 fisadi donneton se mila
 But on the filing of RTI, neither the Congress opened the secret of other medium's earnings nor did the BJP reveal the entire details of the donation
 jabaki desh main artiai ke tahat jaankaree ikattha karne vaali activiston kii report bataati he ki sarkari yojanaon ke tahat 80 karod se lekar do hajaar karod tak kii lut ko ujagar karne ke chakkar main 50 se zyada kaaryakkartaaon par hamale ho gayi or 25 maare gayi
 That is, by allowing even the smallest amount of corruption to come to light, scam scamsters go to any extent
 tab sawaal he ki jab takat raajnneeti main basati he to raajnneetik dal hi agar khud ko artiai se alag rakhenge to phir eemaandaaree yaa paardarshita kaa bharosa kaise jagega
 It is also difficult to make a favorable policy and make laws by sitting in a position of profit
 lekin yah saamne isaliye nahin aa paata kyoki artiai inpar lagu nahin hoga
 Union Highways and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has hoped to improve relations with the Shiv Sena

 Recently, Telugu Desam Party President and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu gave a hint of choosing a different path from NDA, which Shiv Sena surrounded the BJP
 unka kahana he ki bijepi yuti (gathbandhan) dharm kaa paalan nahin karti balki mitra dalon ko kamjor karne main use anand miltaa he
 Shiv Sena said, this is the bjp's practice that it should be in power in alliance with regional parties in the state and later gradually spread its hands and feet by clawing at the allies
 saamana ke jariye shivasena ne kaha ki maharashtra main bijepi kii is karypranali ko shivasena ne chalane nahin diya or unke kaamon kaa pardaafash karte hue maharashtra kii raajnneeti main swabhimaan kaa bhagava jhanda laharaae rakhaa

 If GST (goods and Services Tax) will be one of the biggest tax reforms in the country, then this can happen in this budget
 puure desh kii arthvyavastha ko ek hi dhaanche main laane kaa yah sabase kargar tarika hoga
 Not only governments, but also businessmen, consumers and investors will benefit from this
 desh kii arthvyavastha main is tex kii vajah se 2 fisadi kaa ijapha hone kii ummid jataai ja rahi he
 If Arun Jaitley sets the roadmap for the implementation of GST in this budget, then it is possible that the benefit will start from next financial year
 aaie jaanate hai kaise-1
 The indirect tax system of the Center and the state will come in the same framework
 GST ke lagu hone se octry, central cells tex, state cells tex, intry tex, stamp duty, telecom license fees, turnover tex, guds or services ke transportesan par lagane vaale tex aadi se mukti mil jaaegi
 Governments will have to implement a single tax and focus on its recovery
 2
 The GST recovery will take place under a system at every stage of the supply chain in case of sale of any product or service
 chunki saplaay chen kii antim kadi aam upabhokta hota he isliye usee par iskaa antim bhaar aayega
 3
 sirf ek hi tex lagu hone kii vajah se logon ko kisi bhi utpaada yaa seva kii laagat kaa andaaj ho jayega
 Right now, due to many taxes, it does not seem right
 4
 GST will be applied equally to goods and services, where there is a plan to increase the scope by keeping the minimum tax
 jisamen kam se kam chhot hogi
 So that the tax burden is not too much and since more people pay tax, then the collection will also be more
 5
 Experts believe that with the introduction of this tax system, there will be freedom from tax collection bottlenecks between the state and the center and maintenance of a large system
 puraa bharat ek hi tex ke daayre main aa jayega
 6
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki yah vyavastha zyada paardarshee or karpshan-free hogi
 7
 philhal ek hi utpaada jab factory se nikalataa he tab bhi us par tex lagata he or jab retail outlet par bikta he tab bhi us par tex lagata he
 In GST, any product will be taxed only when it reaches the consumer's hands
 jaise kaccha maal factory pahonchega to factory vaale ko tex dena hoga or jab taiyaar product kanjumar ke haath pahonchega to use tex dena hoga
 8
 GST se desh ko kareeb ek lakh karod rupee kii atirikt kar aay hone kii ummid he
 9
 sabase pehle france ne 1954 main GST lagu kiya
 It now exists in 140 countries
 brazil or canada main doharaa GST system he
 Where both the Center and the state levy GST
 bharat main bhi doharaa GST lagu hone kii charchaa he
 So that the states do not lose revenue after abolishing their taxes
 10
 Implementation of GST will ease the tax system, which will boost exports
 rojgaar badhane kii ummid he

 Eminent writer and Padma Shri awardee Dr
 Ushakiran Khan's new novel 'gai Jhulni Toot' has been published by the book house publication
 is upanyaas main na keval haashiye par padi stri jati kii jeevant tasviir ko kahani ke canvas par ukera gaya he, apitu gram panchayat or vidhaan sabha chunaavon ke samay kii jane vaali siyaasi jod-tod kii jamini haqiqat ko bhi bakhubi prastut kiya gaya he
 Earlier Usha ji has achieved many popularity spots with historical novels like 'bhamati', 'agan Hindola' and 'sirjanhar'
 'gai jhulani tut' ushakiran kii prasiddhi ko ek kadam or aage lekar jaataa he
 'gayi Jhulni Toot' attracts the attention of readers due to its artistic cover and title
 iskaa aavaran chitra madhubani painting he
 Mahalakshmi Madhubani is also given credit in the book
 'gai jhulani tut' kisi aitihaasik charitra yaa ghatana par kendrit na hokar gaanv-dehaat ke parivesh par buni gayi rachana he
 Public engagement is the power of the writer
 yah darasal haashiye par apana jivan jite hue kamalmukhi, ghaanto, devaki or jagat jaise charitron ke umr bhar ke jivan sangharsh kii gaatha he
 The novel begins with a young innocent girl, Kamalamukhi
 vah gaanv main sthit kamaldah kii ore mohit hokar subah-sabere vahaan pahunch jaati he
 She would also face the anger of the mother in the urge to see the hermit hidden in the lotus petals
 lekin uske man main hasarat hi rah jaati ki camel kaa puraa khilaa hua phool dekh paae
 She had lost her father before she was born
 uski maa devaki apane pati kii maut ke baad garbhavastha ke dauraan hi apni bahan ke yahaan chali aati he
 In such a situation, Kamalamukhi is born to her aunt
 devaki kii bahan ke devar jagat marad kaa vivaah ghaanto naam kii ek saawali kintu aakarshak mahila se ho chukaa tha, magar unke koi santan nahin the
 Meanwhile, Ganto's mother falls ill and the world sends her to the maiden to take care of her mother
 idhar apni badi bahan kii shah par devaki jagat ko rijhaane main lag jaati he
 Seeing the instigation of the family and some others and the attraction of Devaki, the heart of the world also gets attached to it
 hit-parijanon ko raji-sakshi kar jagat use rakh letaa he
 On the other hand, when Ganto finds out about this, she herself refuses to come
 sankoch ke kaaran jagat bhi use waapas lene nahin jaataa
 How long was possible in such a situation
 kuch dinon baad ghaanto kaa vivaah ek duhaju jokhim marad se ho jaataa he
 After this, the time clock turns around that Kamalmukhi gets married to Ranjan Kumar, son of the first wife of the world's first wife Ghanto, second wife Jokhan Marad
 ghaanto ko jaise hin pataa chalata he ki ye uski sout kii beti he, usee din se vah kamalmukhi ko pratadit karnaa shuru kar detii he
 Fed up with this harassment, she also lives in Calcutta by visiting her husband Ranjan for some time
 lekin bacchon kii beemaari kii khabar paakar ek din jab vah lautakar gaanv aati he to ghaanto use raat main hi ghar se baahar nikaal detii he
 After this, Kamalamkhi takes both children and walks on such a path which has no permanent residence
 kuch he to sirf jivan kaa athaah sangharsh
 'gaya Jhulni Toot' is the story of a woman facing the same struggle for life
 chaar vyaktiyon or teen alag-alag jagahon kii kahani is upanyaas ko gatiman banaae rakhti he
 On the one hand, Kamalmukhi lives in Patna by cooking and cooking kitchens of others, on the other hand, busy with the politics of the ambitious Ghanto Panchayat in Siripur
 teesri ore madhiya main jagat or devaki kaa aparaadh bodh he, jo kamalmukhi ke prati daayitv ko nibhaane main hui apni chook ko maanate hue bhi ab kuch kar paane main khud ko asamarth pate hai
 "the pace of life is unique
 nadi tal se nikaali mitti kii bhaanti phir samtal ho janaa pravriti he
 "the specialty of the writing of writer Ushakiran Khan is that his characters do not break through all the sufferings and adverse conditions of life, but give the message of Jeejeevisha
 kisi ek vyakti ke sukh se na to kheton main hariyaali chaa jaati he, na uske uske dukh ke taap se khet, nadiyaan, talab suukh jate hai
 When the agitation in the mind starts to shake, it is necessary to maintain a smile on the face, for the front plant
 ushakiran khan ne bihar ke dur-daraaj ke anchalon main based gramin parivesh or vahaan ke lok-jivan kaa behad sahaj or swaabhaavik chithran kiya he
 In this sense, she seems like a representative of Phaniswanath Renu's regional novel genre
 ushakiran ke lekhan kii vishistataa yah he ki kathanak kisi film kii tarah aapke aage se gujarata he or aap swayan ko us parivesh or paatr ke jivan se ghulmil jate he
 The characters they create do not seem artificial

 diggaj salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag ne sweekaar kiya he ki vah australia ke khilaaf 2013 kii test siries ke bich main team prabandhan yaa chayankartaaon kii taraf se bina kisi jaankaree ke baahar kiye jane se aahat the
 Sehwag was ruled out after the second Test match played against Australia in Hyderabad, but the 'nawab of Najafgarh' said that the selectors should have given him a chance to retire in Indian dress by giving him two more Tests
 sahvaag ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, 'maine australia ke khilaaf do test maichon main ran nahin banaae the, isliye main soch rahaa tha ki mujhe aakhri do test maichon main acha pradarshan karne ke liye abhi maukey milenge or yadi main acha pradarshan nahin karata hum, to mujhe baahar kar diya jayega
 If the selectors had given me this opportunity to play two Test matches and said that you play in these two Tests and then retire, i would definitely consider it
 ' Sehwag was asked if there was any communication gap between the BCCI and the team management, so he agreed
 unhone kaha, 'nishchit taur par
 None of the team management, selectors or BCCI told me
 mujhe samachar patron se is bare main jaankaree mili
 It hurt me, but now i have no problem
 ' Sehwag batted in the middle order in his last three seasons in first-class cricket
 vah bhartiya team main bhi aisa chaahate the, lekin unki nahin suni gai
 He said, 'I talked to the team management about this (playing in the middle order), but they believed that i could still do well as an opener and they didn't want to take any risk with the opening pair 
 maine apni taraf se kaaphi prayaas kiye, lekin mujhe madhyakram main mauka nahin mil sakaa
 Comments sahvaag ne kaha, jab maine apni aakhri siries kheli, tab tendulkar team main the
 Kohli and Dhoni were in the team
 pujaara tisare number par khel rahe the
 Tendulkar was playing at number four and Kohli at number five
 iskaa matlab tha ki mujhe chathe number par tendulkar ke baad khelnaa hota, kyonki aap tendulkar ko tisare yaa paanchaven number par khilne ke liye nahin kah sakate the
 So i had no chance to play in the middle order
 unhone haalanki sweekaar kiya ki iske baad unhone dilli kii taraf se gharelu satr main acha pradarshan nahin kiya, jisase unki vaapasi kii sambhaavna khatm ho gai
 He said, when i was dropped, i felt that i am a good player and can come back in the Indian team
 main tab bhi is maansikta main ji rahaa tha ki main ek aakraamak salaami ballebaaj hum, jo ran bana saktaa he, lekin main yah nahin samaj paaya ki gharelu cricket antarrashtriya cricket se puri tarah bhinn he or main tab bhi usee tarah se khel rahaa tha
 Sehwag said, i did not score in that season (2013-14) and my highest score was 56 runs
 main dilli kii paristhitiyon se talmail bithaane ke liye jujh rahaa tha
 The next year i changed my thinking and batting style and gave myself some time and scored close to 500, but i needed a big score last season and maybe i would have returned to the team
 sahvaag ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, 'maine australia ke khilaaf do test maichon main ran nahin banaae the, isliye main soch rahaa tha ki mujhe aakhri do test maichon main acha pradarshan karne ke liye abhi maukey milenge or yadi main acha pradarshan nahin karata hum, to mujhe baahar kar diya jayega

 sahvaag se poocha gaya ki kya bisisiai or team prabandhan kii taraf se samvadaheenata rahi, to unhone is par sahmati jataai
 He said, 'definitely
 team prabandhan, chayankarta yaa bisisiai main se kisi ne bhi mujhe nahin bataaya
 i got information about this from newspapers
 isse main aahat hua, lekin ab mujhe koi pareshaani nahin he
 ' sahvaag ne pratham shrenee cricket main apane aakhri teen satron main madhyakram main ballebaaji kii
 He also wanted this in the Indian team, but he was not listened to

 kohli or dhoni team main the
 Pujara was playing at number three
 tendulkar chauthe or kohli paanchaven number par khel rahe the
 This meant that i would have to play after Tendulkar at number six, because you could not ask Tendulkar to play at number three or fifth
 isliye mere paas madhyakram main khilne kaa koi mauka nahin tha
 He, however, admitted that he did not do well for Delhi in the home season after that , ending the possibility of his return
 unhone kaha, jab mujhe baahar kiya gaya to mujhe lag rahaa tha ki main acha khilaadi hum or bhartiya team main vaapasi kar saktaa hum
 i was still living in the mindset that i am an aggressive opener who can score runs, but i could not understand that domestic cricket is completely different from international cricket and i was still playing the same way
 sahvaag ne kaha, maine us satr (2013-14) main ran nahin banaae or meraa ucchtam score 56 ran tha
 i was struggling to keep pace with the conditions in Delhi
 agle saal maine apni soch or ballebaaji style badali or khud ko kuch samay diya or 500 ke kareeb ran banaae, lekin mujhe pichley satr main bade score kii jarurat thi or ho saktaa tha ki main team main vaapasi kar jaataa
