 Babul Supriyo is going to marry on 9 August in Delhi

 They are constantly coming to Parliament
 lekin wo or unka staff mauka milane par is khaas lamhe ko khubasurat banane kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahe
 Missing in the booking of the new Bang Bhawan, the minister wants to get married with his marriage, so he preferred the new Bang Bhawan rather than a five star to stop his guests from outside in Delhi
 ab babul ko 14 kamaron kii darkaar thi
 On trying booking, it was informed that 14 rooms cannot be booked in the name of one MP simultaneously
 aise main babul kaa pareshaan hona lajimi hi tha
 Didibat had a hard time remembering his marriage and simplicity, forgetting his political differences in Bengal, Babylon sent help from Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee by asking for help
 sutron ke mutabik, babul ne sirf 14 kamare book karvaa dene kii guzarish kii or kaha ki uskaa bill wo de denge 
 Actually, Bang Bhawan comes directly under the Government of Bengal
 phir kya tha, massej milte hi didi kii mamata fouran jaagi
 Going a step further, Mamta called Babylon and said that 14 rooms will be booked for you and you do not have to pay her bill, this is my wedding gift from you
 mamata kii is dariyaadilii se babul kii khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 Now Babylon is breathing a sigh of relief
 aakhir shehanai bajane ke pehle babul ko sukun jo mil gaya he
 According to the soft sources of Babylon against Mamta, the political attitude of Babylon has also become soft, but soft for some time due to Didi's love
 bataur bengal empi babul supriyo adarsh gram yojana main rajya sarkaron ke asahyog kaa mudda uthaane vaale the, jiske chalate unako bengal kii mamata sarkaar ko gherna padataa
 But Mamta's gift touched Babylon so much that she decided to take up the matter after her marriage

 India Today, the most prestigious magazine of the country, is also honoring women who have become the example of success
 yah lagaataar teesraa saal he jab india today ne woomen summit and award kaa aayojan kiya he
 The ceremony in Mumbai was inaugurated by India Today editor-in-chief Arun Puri
 unhone apane udghaatan bhaashan main kaha, ‘apni koshishon se mahilaayein kaaphi taqatvar hui hai
 More women are leaving the household and reaching the professional world than before
 1987 main kaamkaaji mahilaon kaa pratishat 13 tha jo 2001 main badhkar 25 fisadi ho gaya he
 "he said," This percentage of working Indian women is much higher than the number of working women in many countries
 ’arun puri ne kaha, ‘ek nae shodh ke mutabik duniya main kul siio kaa 11 fisadi bhartiya mahilaayein hai
 These figures startle the people of the Western world
 ’tivi host, shef or lekhika padma lakshmi ne is maukey par kaha

 teen talaak bill ko rajyasabha main laane se pehle sarkaar ab vipakshi dalon ke saath baithkar is par sahmati bananaa chaahati he
 According to the proceedings of Parliament on Tuesday, the triple talaq bill was to be introduced in the Rajya Sabha and also passed it
 lekin is bill ke paksh main maahaul banataa nahin dekh kar sarkaar ne apana vichaar badal liya or ab yah bill buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main pesh hoga
 Winter session till 5 January Another reason for not bringing this bill for discussion on Tuesday is that the government wants to pass the first GST related bill in Rajya Sabha, which has already been passed in Lok Sabha
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr sirf 5 janvari tak he or sabase pehle sarkaar apane jaruri bill ko paas karana chaahati he
 Swami said - LJD leader Subramanian Swamy said in both hands of BJP that the condition of three divorces in the Rajya Sabha is such that the government has laddus in both hands
 agar sarkaar rajyasabha main bhi yah bill paas kara leti he to muslim mahilaon ko nyaay dilaane vaala kanoon laane ke liye BJP ko shrey milegaa
 But Subramanian Swamy said that even if the opposition parties stop this bill, there is no harm to the BJP because then it will get a chance to expose the faces of those who oppose it
 subramanyam swami se jab yah poocha gaya ki kuch logon kaa kahana he ki teen talaak ke liye 3 saal ke jail kaa praavdhaan zyada he to unhone kaha ki unke vichaar se iske liye 3 saal kii nahin balki 7 saal kii sajaa honi chahie
 Congress will demand amendment on the bill
 Congress party has also made it clear that it will not oppose this bill, but will demand amendment in it
 samaajawaadee party bhi is bill main sanshodhan kii maang kar rahi he
 Eminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha MP Majid Menon also said that the government prepared the bill in a hurry and no opinion of Muslim representatives, Muslim women and Muslim mps was taken in it
 unka sabase zyada virodh is baat ko lekar he ki teen talaak kanoon kaa durupyog ho saktaa he kyonki agar koi mahila apane pati par aarope laga detii he ki usne teen talaak kaha he to kisi saboot ke bagaiyr bhi use jail kii hawa khaani pad sakati he
 If the bill government sent to the Select Committee is now trying to prevent the bill from being sent to the Select Committee, if it needs to accept some minor suggestions and amendments of the opposition, then it should be accepted so that the bill is done as soon as possible To be able to pass
 agar rajyasabha is bill ko select cameti ko bhejne kaa faisla detii he
 Then this bill will be passed in the budget session itself

 So if i do not perform the organ, the film will be given to someone else
 'rakhine ek trade akhbaar ko die intervyuu main yah bhi kaha ki hameshaa vivaadon main ghire rahane se unki jindagi bahut negative ho gai he
 He said, 'people have made me negative
 vivaadon main rahane kii vajah se mujhe nahin lagata ki koi ladkaa mujhase shaadi karegaa
 But i do not feel sad because i am the daughter of Amitabh Bachchan and Shatrughan Sinha, that it is not easy for me

 ' Prithvi Shaw, born out of the nursery of Yashswi Jwala, has created a world record for the youngest double century, Dhoom 'golgappa Boy' Yashaswi Jaiswal will remember the history he has created with his bat in the cricket world
 
 vaise cricket kii duniya main record banane or tuutane kaa silsilaa to chalata rahata he, lekin kuch records banane vaale khilaadi adhyay likhakar jate hai
 Perhaps the name of Yashasvi has also been included in it
 koun he yashasvi ko parakhane vaala shaks?kaha jaataa he cricket main kariyar bananaa koi 'khel' nahin he, lekin kismat saath de or iraadaa pakkaa ho to sab mumkin he
 In 2011, living in Bhadohi district of UP, Mumbai came to his uncle, living a big dream
 us vakt chachaa kii bhi haisiyat nahin thi mumbai main cricket khilaane kii soch saken kyonki tangi main wo bhi the or yashasvi ke ghar vaale bhi, lekin yashasvi thaan chuke the ki mumbai aae hai to kuch karnaa he
 Also read- This girl became a cricketer by selling water puri, the uncle of Mumbai's uncle's house was small, then initially there was a place to live in a dairy shop
 phir unhone khud ke kharch ke liye golgappas bechney kaa kaam shuru kiya, lekin yashasvi jis iraade (cricket) se mumbai aae the, usase talmail nahin ban rahaa tha
 The age was not too much, so the courage was also wavering and the money was already there
 is bich 2013 main mumbai ke aaazaad maidan main yashasvi par aise shaks kii najar padi, jo unki tarah cricket khilne mumbai aayaa tha
 The man had also hit a lot in Mumbai, watching Tangi closely
 shaayad yahi vajah hogi ki use yashasvi kii parakh sabase achche thi
 This man is none other than Yashasvi's coach Jwala Singh
 jwaala singh kii nursery se hi prithvi shaw bhi nikle hai
 Yashswiji, who played under-19 Indian team, meditated on Yashswi, he had also seen such a situation Jajwala Singh aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki 2013 main aaazaad maidan main net practice ke dauraan yashasvi mujhe dikhaa tha
 i was surprised to see his batting for the first time because the 11-year-old boy was playing list-a bowlers with confidence
 jwaala ne kaha, 'is dauraan mere ek dost ne yashasvi ke bare main bataaya ki ladkaa acha he, lekin mali haalat itani kharaab he ki aage kii raah kathin he
 Then i went and talked to Yashswi myself and called him to my camp to meet him
 ladkaa jajbaati tha or wo mujh se milane aayaa
 When i became acquainted with his situation, i remembered my time
 main bhi upi ke gorakhpur shahar se jid karke cricket khilne ke liye 1995 main mumbai main aayaa tha
 'jwala says,' Initially there was some money, then it was adjusted, but after a year, i had to spend the night in a tent for a few days
 is bich ek parichit ne apane gym main rahane kii jagah de di
 When i was doing well in school cricket, i started getting scholarships, which reduced the tightness a bit, but due to lack of injury and proper guidance, my cricket journey was not very long
 vijay marchent, kooch vihaar, sike naidu trophy ke dauraan hi mujhe itani enjuri ho gai kii mere kariyar par hi brake lag gaya
 After this, i started coaching again
 '6 saal se coach ke saath hi rahete hai yashasvijwala singh ne bataaya ki yashasvi main tallent he, lekin wo halaat se pit rahaa tha, isliye main use 2014 apane ghar lekar chalaa aayaa tha
 Since then he is with me and is the family member of my house
 uske mata-pita gaanv par rahete hai or milane-julne mumbai aate rahete the
 Jwala Singh said that Yashswi is a high-tempered batsman

 dilli main jahrile smog par se aam aadmi behaal he or raajnneeti partiyaan is mudde ko lekar siyasat main juty hai
 After the reprimand of the NGT, the Delhi government came into action from the Center
 haalanki dilli main bade hue pradooshan ke liye dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne sidhe taur par padosi rajyon ko kasuurvaar tehraaya he
 In fact, in Delhi for the third consecutive day, the status of the blog remains the same
 badhate pradooshan ko lekar report main har roj nae khulaase ho rahe hai
 Pollution in Delhi has broken a 17-year record
 aap sunakar sannaate main aa jaaenge ki dilli waalon ke fefde 40 cigarette ke baraabar dhuaan rose sokh rahe hai
 According to the report, Delhi has become 20 times more polluted than normal
 dilli main har chauthe bachche ko fefde kii shikaayat he
 Due to which patients have increased up to 25% in hospitals
 yahi nahin, saans ke marizon kii sankhya 5 se 6 guna bad gai he
 Due to holiday pollution in about 1800 schools, a decision was taken to close more than 1800 schools in Delhi on Saturday 
 pradooshanke kaaran teenon nagar nigamon ne shanivaar ko skulon main chuttee kar di
 There are a total of 1728 schools in the three mcds
 inamen 10 lakh se zyada bachche padhate hai
 Apart from this, many private schools in the city were also closed
 yahi nahin, agar pradooshan ke str main giravat nahin aane par aane vaale dinon main bhi skool band rah sakate hai
 According to the agencies that monitor pollution, never before has Delhi's climate been so bleak
 pehle kabhi bhi dilli main is kadar dam nahin ghut rahaa tha
 Poisonous haze over the skies of Delhi is not only threatening Delhiites, but also scaring the guests visiting here
 jaane, dilli kii hawa kaise hui jahrili?1
 Vehicle fumes are the major reason for air pollution2
 dilaavi kii raat andhadhundh pataakhe chode jane se3
 Fumes of chimneys and factories are major reason4
 bhalswa or gajipur main jalaae ja rahe kooday se5
 Role in increasing dust mites pollution 6
 punjab or haryana main jalaae ja rahe bhuse se7
 In Punjab, 1 crore 8 million tonnes are burnt every year, the landowner says that along with the pollution of firecrackers on Diwali, the smoldering piles of waste are making the winds more toxic
 paryaavaran kii phikr main engiti ne sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai to fouran dilli ke swasthya mantri satendra jain bhalswa pahunch gaye
 Everybody has started checking after the reprimand of NGT
 lekin ilaaj kisi ke paas nahin he
 The effect of poisonous smog is up to the rate of CM of Delhi
 lekin siem sahab jitna phikrmand apane urja sachiv ko hataae jane ko lekar hai utana smog par nahin dikhe
 It is important to note that as soon as you wake up in the morning, you see a thick layer of fog and fog in the winds of Delhi, it is not the result of nature
 ye insaani galatiyon kaa anjaam he, jiske jehar se bachche khans rahe hai, bade kaanp rahe hai lekin raaj karne vaale is sach ko sachche dil se bhaap nahin rahe hai

 Two of the greatest personalities of world cricket - Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne - will face each other for the final time in a competitive cricket match on Friday
 is din sachin kii mumbai indians team or warn kii rajasthan royles team ipel ke is satr ke lig mukaable main vankhede stadium main bhidengi
 Two consecutive defeats against Deccan Chargers and Kings XI Punjab undoubtedly stalled Mumbai Indians' winning campaign, but now this team will take on Warne's team with the intention of returning to the winning track and making it to the playoffs
 mumbai kii team talika main tisare kram par he
 He has 16 digits in his account
 ye ank usne 10wein mukaable ke baad hi juta liye the, lekin 12 mukaable biit jane ke baavjood uske ab bhi 16 ank hi hai
 His defeat in two consecutive matches undoubtedly put a break on his dream of reaching the playoffs, but he still has two matches to achieve this milestone
 ipel main apana aakhri match khilne ja rahi rajasthan royles ke captain shen warn se bhidane ke baad sachin tendulkar kii team 22 may ko apane aakhri lig mukaable main gautam gambheer kii kolkata nite rides team ke saath do-do haath karegi
 While a win against Rajasthan Royals would propel them to the playoffs, Sachin's team would aim to beat the Knight Riders and strengthen their position in the table
 kings ilevan or deccan chargers ke khilaaf sachin kii team kii jis tarah haar hui thi, use dekhte hue yah daawey ke saath kahana thik nahin hoga ki warn kii team ke khilaaf uski jeet tay hi he
 Warne will play his last IPL match and his teammates will do all they can to give him the winning gift
 warn kii team ne ab tak khele gaye 13 maichon se 11 ank jutaaye hai or pichley chaar muqablon se use lagaataar haar jhelni pad rahi he
 Warne's team has nothing to gain, but to save her reputation as the 2008 winner, she would like to defeat Sachin's team
 or phir warn yah match isliye bhi jeetna chahenge, kyonki pratispardhi cricket main unki sachin ke saath maidan par aakhri baar bhidnt hogi
 Anyway, Warne must have loved his reputation this time, because after announcing his departure, this player, who has been calling for support and support from the people, has lost a lot by losing his battle with Rajasthan Cricket Association over the pitch dispute
 sachin kii team ke liye yah match bahut ahm he, kyonki iske jariye use agle daur main jane kaa tikat milegaa
 His dream may remain incomplete in the face of defeat by Rajasthan and Knight Riders, as Kings XI have started trouble for him with 14 points from now
 kings ilevan ke khate main ek match he or uskaa net ran rate bhi sachin kii team se behatar he
 Before making his nomination today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did a mega road show in Kashi on Thursday

 Here at 12
30 pm, the chopper of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath landed on the helipad built at Ramlila Maidan when the sweat of the local BJP leaders was lost
 yogi adityanath ghaziabad pahunch gaye the or ram lila maidan kii jansabha kii zyaadaatar kursiyaan khaali padi thim
 Meanwhile, instead of the public meeting, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath first visited the Shri Dudheshwarnath temple
 takreeban 20 minute baad yogi adityanath ramlila maidan main jansabha ko sambodhit karne manch par pahunch gaye or uske agle bees minute baad yogi kaa sambodhan shuru ho gaya, baavjood iske peeche kii taraf saikadon kursiyaan khaali padi raheen
 Why were the chairs empty? During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, General VK Singh got the status of the biggest victory in Uttar Pradesh in Ghaziabad
 lekin jansabha main kam bheed is baat kaa ishaara kar rahi thi, ki ye chunaav ghaziabad main ve ke singh ke liye kahin baari naa pad jaae
 Because the anti-incumbency wave is clearly visible in Ghaziabad
 haalanki bheed kam hone kaa ek bada kaaran ye bhi rahaa ki ravivaar ko behad garm din tha
 In the midst of the rising mercury at 12 noon, the BJP was finding it difficult to mobilize workers for the public meeting
 'ghaziabad ke liye din raat sochate hai wike singh'yogi adityanath ne gajiabad main apane sambodhan main uttar pradesh ke tamaam bade muddon se lekar ghaziabad ke sthaneey muddon tak kaa zikr kiya
 In his speech, Yogi Adityanath first praised the army and then attacked the opposition fiercely
 iske baad yogi ne general wike singh kii tarifon ke pul baandhe
 Yogi said that General Sahab thinks day and night for Ghaziabad and it is a result of his efforts that today Ghaziabad is making the fastest progress compared to the earlier

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter sharaab pikar shaadi karne aane vaale dulhon kii bihar main aajkal shamat ai hui he
 The brides are refusing to marry the intoxicated grooms
 saath hi huddang karte hue baratiyon kii vajah se bhi shaadiyaan tut rahi hai
 Not only this, such grooms and barayats are also taken hostage, who take up drugs while drunk
 bihar main aise do maamle guruuvar ke hai jahaan ek jagah ladkaa or uske saath puure baratiyon ne sharaab kaa nasha kiya tha or doosraa ek ejeeniyar kii shaadi main nashe main firing karne vaale baratiyon kii vajah se dulhan ne shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 But in the midst of all this, a question arises that brides are teaching them a lesson by not marrying such grooms, but what is the responsibility of the police administration after the prohibition of liquor law in Bihar
 kya aise duulhon ko khilaaf kanoonee karrwai nahin hona chahie
 Bihar has stringent laws against drinkers
 aise main isi lagn main kai aise maamle hue jisamen duulhaa sharaab ke nashe main tha or dulhan ne usase shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 In order to return the dowry equal, the villagers take the entire wedding procession hostage, including the groom
 dahej kaa samaan dekar baaraati to chhot jate hai
 However, they do not get the punishment for the alcohol they drank
 guuruuvaar ko mujffapur ke mushahri prakhand ke dumri gaanv main ek baraat vaishali jile se ai
 In this procession, all the processions including the groom were drunk
 baraat daravaaje laga jaymaal hua or baratiyon ne khub dhamal machaaya
 When the boy reached the pavilion to get married, his father also reached the pavilion
 nashe main dhutt ladke ke pita or anya baratiyon ne gaali-galouj shuru kar di
 In the meantime, the boy who became a groom also came to the rescue and came to know that the groom was also drunk
 ladki ne jab dekha ki ladkaa or uskaa pita bhisharab ke nashe menhain to usne shaadi se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The villagers took the groom and the baraatis hostage
 dahej kaa saamaan waapas milane tak 24 ghante tak inhen bandhak banaaya gaya
 Similarly, drunk firing on the boy side proved costly in Majhiyanv village of Rohtas district
 baratiyon kii harkaton se dulhan bhadak gai or usne shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya
 The wedding procession had to be returned
 jaymaal ke samay duulhe ke dost khushi main firing kar rahe the
 a firing then went out next to the bride's brother

 input : bhashaa Summer means that for the youth and the elderly is associated with strong sunlight, dusty hot winds, humidity, infection and many diseases, summer for children is associated with freedom from school, studies, teachers, homework
 garmi kii chhuttiyon main bachche khel-kud, manoranjan or khaane-pine main zyada samay bitaate hai, jisase unke parijanon ko unpar dhyaan rakhana thodaa zyada mushkil ho jaataa he
 Considering these same child's care, the Consultant Dr
 of Pediatric Gastroentrology of Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals
 vidyut bhaatia ne kuch aasaan se suzav die hai, jisase aap apane bacchon kaa behatar tareeke se dhyaan rakh sakate hai
 -avoid Heat: Keep in mind that your child is hydrated throughout the day, children often forget to drink water and thirst for hours while they are busy with sports and outdoor activities
 iske liye bacchon ke aise vikalp den, jisase unke sharir main pani or electrolite kaa santulan bana rahe
 Although there is no water option, coconut water, fruit juices, sritus fruits, lassi, buttermilk and fruit smoothies can be good choices in this season
 - bachche ko kabornated peya padaarthon se dur rakhen, inase sharir sirf deehydrate hota he, or sharir main sugar (chini) kaa str bad jaataa he
 Note the correct diet: In the summer, the right diet is very important
 is sijan main sharir ko atirikt urja kii jarurat hoti he, kyonki taapmaana badhane ke saath sharir main metabolic badlaav aate hai
 Therefore, it is advisable not to consume foods containing oils and fats
 mausami falon, subjiyon or pryaapt maatra mentaral padaarthon kaa sevenkarna chahie
 This allows children to remain active throughout the day
 garmiyon ke mausam main aam, lichi, kelaa, tarbooz, kharbooza, plums or chairi jaise dheron vikalp uplabdh hote hai
 - Keep yourself covered: Sunlight is beneficial for health, but in summer the sun is very strong which can make us sick
 bachche thodi der tej dhoop main rahane par bhi dihydration or sanstroke kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 The best way to avoid this is to stay indoors throughout the day, go out early in the morning and in the evening
 - agar baahar janaa jaruri ho tsapane aap ko cover kar len, khaastaur par bacchon kaa zyada dhyaan rakhen
 Clothes should also be comfortable and ventilated during this season, which can protect children from sunlight
 garmiyon main sir dhakne ke liye topi kaa istemaal karen
 With sunglasses you can protect your eyes from dust, dirt and heat
 - bachche ko kabhi bhi car main band na karen :aise bahut se udhaaharan dekhe gaye hai jab bacchon kii band car main maut ho jaati he
 The parents lock them in the car for some time to protect them from the sun
 yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki band jagah par taapmaana jaldi badhata he
 This happens even faster in the car, because the body of the car is made of metal
 thodi hi der main car oven kii tarah tapane lagati he
 It becomes difficult for the baby to even breathe
 aise main bacchon ke saath bado ko bhi yah saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 - Take full care of children even inside the house: It is important to take full care of children even inside the house
 unhen bich bich main pani or taral padaarth dete rahen
 Dehydration can occur anywhere, even inside the house, the temperature suddenly rises
 - allergy or mausami badlaav kaa dhyaan rakhen :garmiyon main malaria, dengue, chikangunia kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Similarly, the chances of jaundice, skin diseases and diarrhea also increase
 aise main jaruri he ki bacchon ko machharon se surakshit rakhaa jaae
 Use mosquito repellent, dress children in full sleeves and use anti-mosquito patches or gels
 - garmiyon main khelon ke dauraan saavdhaanee baraten :tairaaki ho yaa anya khel jaise cricket, footbal, badminter aadi
 It is important to protect yourself from the sun and drink plenty of water during the game
 - samar care kit :samar care kit taiyaar kar len, bachche ko ghar ke andar gatividhiyon main vyast rakhen
 This kit should contain glucose, ORS, water bottle, cap, sunglasses, note books and special instructions for summer
 saath hi 'kya karen' or 'kya na karen' or 'apatkaaleen sthiti ke liye contact nambar' jaisi sabhi chijen bhi honi chahie

 com / btxtask1zz — RSS (@rssorg) June 7, 2018 sahaara supremeo subrat royako supreme court se raahat nahin mili he
 The court reserved the judgment on bail on Thursday
 court ne sahaara ke vakil kapil sibbal se kaha ki unki ore se di jane vaali bank guarantee tab tak sweekaar nahin kii jaaegi, jab tak unki ore se bhavishya main bhugtan kaa 'rodmap' saaf nahin ho jaataa
 Subrata Roy's lawyer Kapil Sibal presented a draft bank guarantee in the court in lieu of bail, but it was not accepted
 yaad rahe ki subrat roy kareeb ek saal setihaad jail main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department lawyer told the court that Sahara owes Rs 7595 crore
 iske alaava 82 karod rupee kaa byaaj bhi unhen chukaana he
 Earlier on 23 March this year, the Supreme Court gave the Sahara Group a final grant of Rs 10,000 crore to release Subrata Roy and two directors from jail
 is raashi kaa upyog niveshkon ko aanshik bhugtan karne ke liye kiya jayega, jise sahaara group kii companiyon ne 2008-09 main vaikalpik rup se purna parivartaneey dibenture (oefasidi) ke jariye niveshkon se jutai thi

 Even after the funds from Nuam Financial Services, the company had to raise Rs 650 crore and for that Sahara was allowed to sell its 10 properties across the country
 agar in 10 sampattiyon ko bechney ke baad bhi raashi puri nahin hoti, to court ne sahaara ko uske ambi vaili sampatti ko bhi bechney kii anumati di thi
 The court gave Sahara three months to explore all sorts of options to comply with the March 26, 2014 order
 court ne kaha tha ki agar sahaara 5,000 karod rupee nakad or itani hi raashi kii bank guarantee juta paane main safal nahin hoga, to sahaara kii sampatti ko bechakar utani raashi jutaney ke liye sarkari prabandhankarta niyukt kiya jayega
 On August 30, 2012, the Supreme Court had directed two Sahara companies - SIRECL and SHICL - to return Rs 17,400 crore to investors with 15 per cent interest, which they had raised through ofcds in 2008-09
 bazaar niamak bhartiya pratibhuti or vinimay board (sebi) ke mutabik yah raashi doguni se bhi adhik ho chuki he

 asia or duniya se pehle dhaka uniwarsity ke bangbandhu kanvension centre main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashan ke ek ansh kaa tivetor par postmortem hone laga
 Twitter has many variations of the world's hashtag army
 kai baar isaki lagaam ek bani banaai sena ke paas hoti he to kai baar twitor par maujuud janata kaa ek hissaa hashtag sena main badal jaataa he or tarif yaa aalochana main apane jumale ko trend kara detaa he
 In the language of Twitter, it is called a troll
 pradhanmantri ne apane lambey bhaashan main kisi ek jagah kah diya ki khushi kii baat he ki 'bangladesh kii pradhanmantri mahila hone ke baavjood bhi danke ke chot par kah rahi he ki terarysm ke sambandh main meraa jiro tolerance he
 i congratulate Sheikh Hasina ji who is courageously saying that i have zero tolerance with tetterism
 bas twitor par hashtag sena ban gai or # despitebeingawoman ke naam se pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke is ek hisse kii aalochana hone lagi
 Began to be mocked

 Swati Chaturvedi (@bainjal) writes, # despitebeingawoman succeeded in getting up and having breakfast durgi nandini (@nandinidurga) likhti hai, aurat hone ke baavjood main is desh main zindaa hum or saans le rahi hum
 It is a great achievement in itself
 arpita das (@yodakinthestore) likhti hai, pradhanmantri kya ye kahana chaahate hai ki ham auraten aatankwaad ko bardaasht karti rahati hai
 # despitebeingawoman pradhanmantri ne kai jagah par bangladesh main mahilaon kii sthiti kii jamkar tarif bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister said that birds, wind and water do not require a visa
 unke bheetar kaa kavi is aadhaar par kootneeti ke formule badalane laga to phir pakistan or china ghar baithe utsahit ho jaaenge
 Here you should understand how cleverly he gave a positive message to Bangladesh waiting for his statement on Teesta and also took the edge
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki bangladesh ke saath unka ek imotional atachament he
 When the Jana Sangh launched a satyagraha for the recognition of Bangladesh, then it got a chance to participate in it
 yah narendra modi kii pehali raajnneetik gatividhi thi
 Modi praised Bangladesh's progress on economic and social standards
 kaha ki bangladesh kii jidipi 6 pratishat kii dar se aage bad rahi he yah bharat ke liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 In his speech, the Prime Minister mentioned the role of India in the creation of Bangladesh and also enhanced the value of Bangladesh
 dhaka se unhone islamabad par bhi nishaanaa saadh liya
 Pakistan did not name it, but said that 90 thousand Pakistani soldiers who had oppressed the citizens of Bangladesh were with India
 lekin hindustan kaa charitra dekhie, hindustan kii sena kaa charitra dekhie, hamane bangladesh kii dharti kaa upyog pakistan par goliyaan chalaane ke liye nahin kiya
 We returned 90 thousand soldiers
 iske baad bharat ko sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ke liye raste khul jane chahie
 Wherever Prime Minister Modi goes, he is aggressively raising the permanent membership of the United Nations
 unhone kaha ki dwitiya vishwayudd main 15 lakh se bhi zyada hindustan kii fouj kiske liye ladi or mari
 Bangladesh also had children who sacrificed in World War II
 aaj bhi sanyukt raashtra kahata he ki pis keeping force usamen agar sabase uttam kaam he to bharat kii sena kaa hota he
 Despite that, India is longing for a permanent seat in the Security Council
 duusare desh kii zamin par kya yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat taras rahaa he
 The Prime Minister was repeatedly saying that being a poor country does not earn the Nobel Prize
 abhi tak bharat ke 11 logon ko nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote the national anthem of these two countries, received the Nobel Prize in 1913
 bangladesh ke mohammad younus ko gramin bank ke model ke kaaran 2006 main nobel prize mila tha
 This year, Kailash Satyarthi of India and Malala of Pakistan jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kabhi man karata he ki navakhli jaaun, jahaan mahatma gandhi kaa musium bana hua he
 Bapu has an ashram, should i ever go to Navakhali
 hindu muslim dange main jal rahe navakhli main gandhi kaa janaa or vahaan shanti kaayam karnaa gandhi ke prayogon kaa shandaar lamhaa he
 His doctrine of non-violence reaches its peak in Noakhali itself
 modi vahaan jane kii ichha zaahir kar kisi ko to sandesh de hi rahe honge
 The Bangladesh tour is successful in every respect
 bhoomi seemaa samjhauta aitihaasik to he, ab bangladesh or bharat ke bich jahaazon ko chalis din kaa safar nahin karnaa hoga
 Within seven days, India's ship will reach Chittagong and Mangla Port, which has been developed by China
 bangladesh khush he ki bharat ko padosi ke rup main pakistan or china ke alaava ham bhi nazar aane lage hai
 The Prime Minister is being praised in Bangladesh's newspapers
 bharat main kuch logon ne kaha ki bhoomi seemaa vivaad kii tulana berlin diwaar se kar unhone apane kamazor itihaas bodh kaa parichay diya he
 His statement in this regard was as follows - i wrote one of the writers here today, i have not been able to read the whole, but i read a headline that they have signed the land agreement of Bangladesh and India with the fall of the Berlin Wall
 Have compared
 main kahata hum unhone badi soch ke saath rakhaa he
 If the same incident had happened in any other part of the world, it would have been a big discussion in the world, no one will ask us why the people of poor country are opened
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main bangladesh ke nirmaan main indira gandhi kaa naam tak nahin liya
 Narendra Modi has embarrassed India by saying that we have given up
 pradhanmantri jab vaajapeyi ji ke liye award grahan kar rahe the, tab bhi unhen lajja nahin ai ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aayaa hum, indira ji bharat kii pradhanmantri thim main unako samaran karun
 These are the words of Anand Sharma
 anand sharma ne kaha ki land boundry act 2011 main upie lekar ai thi lekin bijepi ne virodh kiya
 This time also this agreement would not have happened if the Congress had not cooperated
 whats-ap sushma swaraj kaa donon video chal rahaa he, jisamen ve ek saal pehle virodh karti hai or ek saal baad samarthan
 The comments congress ne kaha ki jab pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh bangladesh gaye the is samjhaute ke liye to apane saath purvottar ke sabhi mukhyamantri ko lekar gaye the
 This time he has been despised
 sintabar 2011 main manmohan singh ke saath purvottar ke chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantri gaye the, is baar sirf mamata banerjee gayi thim
 During Manmohan Singh's visit in 2011, Indira Gandhi received Bangladesh's highest honor Bangladesh Independence Award
 iske baad aata he, bangladesh mukti yuddh sammaan jo 2013 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko or is baar atal bihari vaajapeyi ko diya gaya he
 In 2012, Bangladesh had conferred the Mukti War Honor and the Mukti War Friendship Award to 52 Indians
 anand sharma kah sakate the ki pradhanmantri indira kii jagah raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa naam to le hi sakate the
 Although the Congress has criticized the speech, not what India has achieved in the tour
 twitor kii duniya kii hashtag sena ke kai rup hote hai
 Many times its rein is with a built army, sometimes a part of the public on Twitter turns into a hashtag army and makes its jumla trend in praise or criticism
 twitor kii bhashaa main ise trol kehete hai
 In one of his long speeches, the Prime Minister said in one place that it is a matter of happiness that 'despite being a woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, she is saying on the injury of Danke that i have zero tolerance in relation to terrorism
 main shaikh hasina ji kaa abhinandan karata hum jo himmat ke saath yah kah rahi hai ki tetarysm ke saath meraa zero tolerance he
 The hashtag became an army on the bus tweeter and this part of the Prime Minister's speech called # despitebeingawoman was criticized
 mazaaq udaaya jane laga
 i will present some samples of this to you
 swati chaturvedi (@bainjal) likhti hai, subah uthne or naashtaa karne main safal rahi # despitebeingawoman Durga Nandini (@nandinidurga) writes, Despite being a woman, i am alive and breathing in this country

 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Prime Minister in his speech did not even name Indira Gandhi in the construction of Bangladesh

 Even when the Prime Minister was receiving the award for Vajpayeeji, he did not feel ashamed that i have come as the Prime Minister of India, Indiraji was the Prime Minister of India, i should remember him
 ye anand sharma ke shabd hai
 Anand Sharma said that the Land Boundary Act brought the UPA in 2011 but the BJP protested
 is baar bhi ye samjhauta nahin hota agar congress ne sahyog nahin kiya hota
 Both videos of whats-app Sushma Swaraj are running, in which she protests a year ago and support a year later
 tippaniyan The Congress said that when Manmohan Singh went to Bangladesh as Prime Minister, he had taken all the Chief Ministers of the Northeast with him for this agreement
 is baar unka tiraskaar kiya gaya he
 In September 2011, Manmohan Singh accompanied the Chief Minister of four northeastern states, this time only to Mamata Banerjee
 2011 main manmohan singh ke daure par indira gandhi ko bangladesh kaa sarvocch sammaan bangladesh swadhinata sammaan mila tha
 Next comes the Bangladesh Liberation War Award, which was conferred on President Pranab Mukherjee in 2013 and this time to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 2012 main bangladesh ne 52 bharatiyon ko mukti yuddh sammaan or mukti yuddh maitri sammaan diya tha
 Anand Sharma could have said that the Prime Minister could have taken the name of President Pranab Mukherjee in place of Indira
 vaise congress ne bhaashan kii aalochana kii he, daure main jo bharat ne hasil kiya he uski nahin
 In one of his long speeches, the Prime Minister said in one place that it is a matter of happiness that 'despite being a woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, she is saying on the injury of Danke that i have zero tolerance in relation to terrorism
 main shaikh hasina ji kaa abhinandan karata hum jo himmat ke saath yah kah rahi hai ki tetarysm ke saath meraa zero tolerance he

 Bangladesh also had children who sacrificed in World War II

 His statement in this regard was as follows - i wrote one of the writers here today, i have not been able to read the whole, but i read a headline that they have signed the land agreement of Bangladesh and India with the fall of the Berlin Wall
 Have compared
 main kahata hum unhone badi soch ke saath rakhaa he
 If the same incident had happened in any other part of the world, it would have been a big discussion in the world, no one will ask us why the people of poor country are opened
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main bangladesh ke nirmaan main indira gandhi kaa naam tak nahin liya
 Narendra Modi has embarrassed India by saying that we have given up
 pradhanmantri jab vaajapeyi ji ke liye award grahan kar rahe the, tab bhi unhen lajja nahin ai ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aayaa hum, indira ji bharat kii pradhanmantri thim main unako samaran karun
 These are the words of Anand Sharma
 anand sharma ne kaha ki land boundry act 2011 main upie lekar ai thi lekin bijepi ne virodh kiya
 This time also this agreement would not have happened if the Congress had not cooperated
 whats-ap sushma swaraj kaa donon video chal rahaa he, jisamen ve ek saal pehle virodh karti hai or ek saal baad samarthan
 The comments congress ne kaha ki jab pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh bangladesh gaye the is samjhaute ke liye to apane saath purvottar ke sabhi mukhyamantri ko lekar gaye the
 This time he has been despised
 sintabar 2011 main manmohan singh ke saath purvottar ke chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantri gaye the, is baar sirf mamata banerjee gayi thim
 During Manmohan Singh's visit in 2011, Indira Gandhi received Bangladesh's highest honor Bangladesh Independence Award
 iske baad aata he, bangladesh mukti yuddh sammaan jo 2013 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko or is baar atal bihari vaajapeyi ko diya gaya he
 In 2012, Bangladesh had conferred the Mukti War Honor and the Mukti War Friendship Award to 52 Indians
 anand sharma kah sakate the ki pradhanmantri indira kii jagah raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa naam to le hi sakate the
 Although the Congress has criticized the speech, not what India has achieved in the tour

 # despitebeingawoman pradhanmantri ne kai jagah par bangladesh main mahilaon kii sthiti kii jamkar tarif bhi kii he
 The Prime Minister said that birds, wind and water do not require a visa
 unke bheetar kaa kavi is aadhaar par kootneeti ke formule badalane laga to phir pakistan or china ghar baithe utsahit ho jaaenge
 Here you should understand how cleverly he gave a positive message to Bangladesh waiting for his statement on Teesta and also took the edge
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki bangladesh ke saath unka ek imotional atachament he
 When the Jana Sangh launched a satyagraha for the recognition of Bangladesh, then it got a chance to participate in it

 In his speech, the Prime Minister mentioned the role of India in the creation of Bangladesh and also enhanced the value of Bangladesh

 Pakistan did not name it, but said that 90 thousand Pakistani soldiers who had oppressed the citizens of Bangladesh were with India
 lekin hindustan kaa charitra dekhie, hindustan kii sena kaa charitra dekhie, hamane bangladesh kii dharti kaa upyog pakistan par goliyaan chalaane ke liye nahin kiya
 We returned 90 thousand soldiers
 iske baad bharat ko sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ke liye raste khul jane chahie
 Wherever Prime Minister Modi goes, he is aggressively raising the permanent membership of the United Nations

 Bangladesh also had children who sacrificed in World War II
 aaj bhi sanyukt raashtra kahata he ki pis keeping force usamen agar sabase uttam kaam he to bharat kii sena kaa hota he

 The Prime Minister was repeatedly saying that being a poor country does not earn the Nobel Prize

 During Manmohan Singh's visit in 2011, Indira Gandhi received Bangladesh's highest honor Bangladesh Independence Award
 iske baad aata he, bangladesh mukti yuddh sammaan jo 2013 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko or is baar atal bihari vaajapeyi ko diya gaya he
 In 2012, Bangladesh had conferred the Mukti War Honor and the Mukti War Friendship Award to 52 Indians
 anand sharma kah sakate the ki pradhanmantri indira kii jagah raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa naam to le hi sakate the
 Although the Congress has criticized the speech, not what India has achieved in the tour
 apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne bangladesh ke nirmaan main bharat kii bhoomika kaa zikr kiya to bangladesh kaa maan bhi badhaayaa
 He also targeted Islamabad from Dhaka
 pakistan kaa naam to nahin liya lekin kaha ki hamane jin 90 hazaar logon ne bangladesh ke nagarikon par zulm kiya tha aise 90 hazaar pakistani sainik bharat ke paas the
 But look at the character of India, see the character of the army of India, we did not use the land of Bangladesh to fire on Pakistan
 hamane 90 hazaar sainik lautaa die
 After this, India should open avenues for permanent membership of the United Nations
 pradhanmantri modi jahaan bhi jate hai, vahaan sanyukt raashtra kii sthaayee sadsyta ko kaaphi aakraamak tareeke se uthaa rahe hai
 He said that in the Second World War, for whom more than 15 lakh soldiers of India fought and died
 bangladesh ke bhi bachche the jinhone dwitiya vishwayuddh main balidaan die
 Even today, the United Nations says that if the Peace Keeping Force is the best work in it, then the Indian Army belongs to it
 uske baavjood bhi suraksha parishad main permanent seat ke liye bharat ko tarasna padataa he
 On the land of another country, can it be said that India is craving
 pradhanmantri baar-baar kah rahe the ki garib desh hone ke kaaran nobel prize nahin miltaa
 So far, 11 people from India have received the Nobel Prize
 in donon deshon kaa raashtragan likhane vaale rabindranath tagaur ko 1913 main nobel prize mila tha
 Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh received the Nobel Prize in 2006 due to the model of Grameen Bank
 isi saal bharat ke kailash satyaarthee or pakistan kii malala ko sanyukt rup se shanti kaa hi nobel puraskaar mila he
 The Prime Minister said that he never wants to go to Navakhali, where the museum of Mahatma Gandhi is built
 baapu kaa ashram he, kabhi navakhli chalaa jaaun
 Gandhi's visit to Nawakhali burning in Hindu Muslim riots and peace there is a great moment for Gandhi's experiments
 noakhli main hi ahimsa kaa unka siddhant apane charam par pahunchataa he
 Modi must have been giving a message to someone, expressing his desire to go there
 har lihaaz se bangladesh kaa daura kaamyaab he
 The land boundary agreement is historic, now ships between Bangladesh and India will not have to travel for forty days
 saat dinon main hi bharat kaa jahaaz chitagong or mangala port par pahunch jayega, jise china ne viksit kiya he
 Bangladesh is happy that apart from Pakistan and China, we are also seeing India as a neighbor
 bangladesh ke akhabaaron main pradhanmantri kii khub tarif ho rahi he
 Some people in India said that by comparing the land boundary dispute with the Berlin Wall, they have shown their weak history realization
 is sambandh main unka bayaan is prakaar tha- maine aaj yahaan ek main yahaan kii kisi ek riter ne likhaa tha main puraa to pard nahin paaya hum, lekin ek hedline padhi unhone bangladesh or bharat ke zamin ke samjhaute ko berlin kii diwaar girane kii ghatana se tulana kii he
 i say they have kept up with great thinking
 yahi ghatana duniya ke kisi or bhu-bhaag main hoti to vishwa main badi charchaa ho jaati pataa nahin, nobel prize dene ke raste khole jate hamen koi nahin poochhega kyon ham garib desh ke log hai
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Prime Minister in his speech did not even name Indira Gandhi in the construction of Bangladesh
 narendra modi ne yah kahkar ki hamane chhod die, hamane faisla kar diya bharat ko sharmasaar kiya he
 Even when the Prime Minister was receiving the award for Vajpayeeji, he did not feel ashamed that i have come as the Prime Minister of India, Indiraji was the Prime Minister of India, i should remember him
 ye anand sharma ke shabd hai
 Anand Sharma said that the Land Boundary Act brought the UPA in 2011 but the BJP protested
 is baar bhi ye samjhauta nahin hota agar congress ne sahyog nahin kiya hota
 Both videos of whats-app Sushma Swaraj are running, in which she protests a year ago and support a year later
 tippaniyan The Congress said that when Manmohan Singh went to Bangladesh as Prime Minister, he had taken all the Chief Ministers of the Northeast with him for this agreement
 is baar unka tiraskaar kiya gaya he
 In September 2011, Manmohan Singh accompanied the Chief Minister of four northeastern states, this time only to Mamata Banerjee
 2011 main manmohan singh ke daure par indira gandhi ko bangladesh kaa sarvocch sammaan bangladesh swadhinata sammaan mila tha
 Next comes the Bangladesh Liberation War Award, which was conferred on President Pranab Mukherjee in 2013 and this time to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 2012 main bangladesh ne 52 bharatiyon ko mukti yuddh sammaan or mukti yuddh maitri sammaan diya tha
 Anand Sharma could have said that the Prime Minister could have taken the name of President Pranab Mukherjee in place of Indira
 vaise congress ne bhaashan kii aalochana kii he, daure main jo bharat ne hasil kiya he uski nahin
 Wherever Prime Minister Modi goes, he is aggressively raising the permanent membership of the United Nations
 unhone kaha ki dwitiya vishwayudd main 15 lakh se bhi zyada hindustan kii fouj kiske liye ladi or mari
 Bangladesh also had children who sacrificed in World War II
 aaj bhi sanyukt raashtra kahata he ki pis keeping force usamen agar sabase uttam kaam he to bharat kii sena kaa hota he

 striker sunil chhetri kaa nasli tippanee ko lekar rashtriya coach bab haatan ke samarthan main kiye gaye twit se akhil bhartiya footbal mahasang (efeef) itnaa khafa ho gaya ki usne is khilaadi ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii chetavanee de daali
 Chhetri expressed disappointment in his tweet on Tuesday that Bhadrajans like Houghton (indian referee) were accused of making racist remarks
 unhone kaha, yah sharmnaak hoga yadi vah coach pad chhod kar jate hai
 Chhetri wrote, Baba is less than we can thank him for thinking or analyzing what he has done for football in India
 yadi vah chhodkar jate hai to yah sharmnaak hoga
 He has written, it is also a bad thing that we have accused him of making racist remarks against him
 maine un jaisaa bhadrajan nahin dekha he jo vishwastareey coach hai or jinhen apaar anubhav he
 Sorry bab
 haatan par bhartiya referi dinesh nair ne pichley saal pune main yaman ke khilaaf antarrashtriya match ke dauraan nasli tippanee karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 aiff's three-member committee is investigating these allegations
 chhetri kii tippanee par kadaa ravaiya apanaate hue efeef mahasachiv kushal das ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki kaaryakari samiti unke khilaaf karrwai karne par vichaar karegi
 "the AIFF is deeply troubled and worried by the functioning of the national team players and such unnecessary statements in the case of coach Bab Houghton," AIFF said
 das ne kaha, efeef kii agali kaaryakarini main is masale par nishchit taur par vichaar kiya jayega or yadi jaruri hua to karrwai kii jaaegi
 If the AIFF takes action on Chhetri, he will be the first Indian footballer to be punished for commenting on Twitter
 efeef ke jari bayaan ke baad chhetri ne phir se twit kiya or kaha ki unhone mahasang ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin kaha
 This is not the first time Chhetri has supported Houghton in the racial comment case
 efeef kaaryakarini ne farvari main jab haatan ko bakhrast karne ke liye kanoonee salaah lene kaa faisla kiya to chhetri ne kaha tha ki yah anbhavi englishman par nasli tippanee karne kaa aarope lagaana anuchit hoga
 National football team captain Baichung Bhutia also said that Houghton had not made any racist remarks against Nair and the referee was making false allegations
 haatan ko 26 march ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya tha jisamen un par nair ke khilaaf nasli tippanee karne or bhartiya footbal ke bare main apmanjanak tippanee karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 At the panel's first hearing on April 11, Houghton denied the allegations and dismissed them as baseless
 chhetri ne apane naye twit main likhaa he, patrkaar bab ke bare main mere pehle vaale twit ko lekar phone kar rahe hai
 i did not comment against AIFF and did not say a word against it

 nae dhaanche main panchayat raaj lagu hone kaa yah rajat jayanti varsh he
 The dream of empowering gram panchayats, the lower unit of democracy, with financial and executive rights, continues even after 25 years
 jaagruk pratinidhi panchayat str par nirantar prayaas kar rahe hai
 Due to the foresight of Aarti Devi of Odisha, Danka of Dhanukapada Gram Panchayat in Ganjam district resonated all over the country
 2012 main aarti devi sabase yuva sarpanch (kaarykaal 2012-2017) huin
 Aarti, age 32, who left the job of a bank officer to become sarpanch, created a new definition of innovative development of her gram panchayat
 unhone dobaaraa sarpanch kaa chunaav nahin ladaa par niyamit gram panchayat jaati hai, logon se milti hai
 a crowd of one and a half thousand runs in their meetings
 ve kahati hai ki yuva peedi ko badhanaa he to jagah khaali kerani hogi
 In February 2014, he represented India in the International Visitors Leadership Program in the US
 odishavasi ise apane liye gaurav kii baat maanate hai
 His story was written by him: “the initial education and writing was from the village itself
 vahaan kii samskruti-sabhyataa mujhamen rachi-basii thi
 The great thing is that i always had the passion to do something for the village, just looking for an opportunity, which was found
 pard-likhakar bank main naukari kii
 After a long time i got a chance to go to the village
 gaanv waalon ne mere saamne prastaav rakh diya ki sarpanch kaa chunaav ladiye
 The village is with you
 sochaa kya karuungi sarpanch banakar, gaanv waalon se hafte-do hafte kaa samay maanga
 The bus took the decision and the journey began
 maine naukari chhod di
 Contested, i got the highest number of votes in the surrounding 47 panchayats
 mahila hone kii vajah se mujhe apane kaam karne main koi dikkat nahin hui
 Frankly, women and men fought me together
 dhire-dhire gramsabha kii baithak main dedh se do hajaar mahilaayein aane lageen
 There was a desire to move ahead among the people
 main sakshartaa par jor dene lagi
 a thousand women came to read and write
 unheen main se ward memberon kaa chunaav kiya
 We gave the slogan "tipa nohne-archakat" ie sign, not thumb
 mahila shashaktikaran ke liye swatantra mahila gramsabha banaai
 In Dhanukapada panchayat, one and a half lakh trees were planted which are now grown
 gaanv waalon ne bachche kii tarah inaki dekhbhaal kii
 Our Panchayat received the Prakrit Mitra Award
 yahi nahin, gram panchayat main pakki sadak ke liye andolan chalaaya
 Not only the Dhanukapada Panchayat, but also the people of Kadachhai, Pankalbadi and k Tubari Panchayat joined together
 piemrwai main 7
 42 crores Rs
 sweekrut kara liya
 Chamcham became roads
 hamaare gaanv kaa 10veen tak kaa skool ek teacher ke bharose tha
 i got two and a half thousand rupees from the Panchayati fund
 main gaanv ke padhe-likhe berozegaar teen yuvakon ko teacher rakh liya
 School started pehle ke rigelt main 14 bachche first or second divijan se paas hue
 Apart from this, the state government started independent women gram sabha, Kalyan Mandap at the gram panchayat level, nationalized rural bank or subsidiary bank at the panchayat level so that the money of the villagers does not get stuck in the chit fund companies
 har ghar main shauchalay, pani kii supplai kaa conection or lij par lekar nijee jameen par ped lagaae or phir kisaanon ko waapas kar diya
 i have built 1,500 toilets in villages of Gram Panchayat under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 inamen se 15 mahila shauchalay hai
 Bathrooms of women were also built
 ye meri badi uplabdhiyaan hai
 First case of scam caught in PDS
 teen chaar maheene se rashan hi nahin mil rahaa tha
 Having read the manual, i understood what i can do
 phir pension gadabadi, indira awaas yojana main bichauliyon kaa khel samajhi
 One thing i strongly implemented is that when the schemes come to the village, the beneficiaries are identified and the benefits reach them through the committee, not through a single person
 lekin ab dobaaraa sarpanch kaa chunaav nahin laduungi
 i will encourage the youth
 yuva aage aaen, netritv karen
 i will continue to serve gram panchayat wherever i am
 kaamkaaj ke bare main mukhyamantri (naveen patnayak) se baatcheet hui
 There should be a passion to innovate in the service sector, whatever the platform
 meri raay main panchayat str par jo bhi centre ke sahyog se kaamkaaj ho rahaa he, uski masping kii jaani chahie
 Expenditure of money should be monitored in the name of poverty alleviation
 isakelawa panchayat ko kaaryakramon ke liye rajyon ko or dhan diya jaae jiskaa panchayat padaadhikariyon ke madhyam se vyay ho
 This necessitates that district plans should be made compulsorily in consultation with the people in Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas
 maine rajya sarkaar ko bataaya ki panchayat adhikariyon kaa cader hi pruthak kar diya jaae

 ) The result of the general election in Israel, the count of more than 90 percent of the votes is lagging behind by one seat
 The result of the second general election in Benjamin Netanyahuizrayal has been twisted for the second time in 6 months
 maujuuda pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu kii likud party is vakt ek seat se pichad rahi he or uske paas kul 31 siten hai
 At the same time, Kahol Levan of Opposition Leader Benny Gantz has one seat ahead ie 32 seats
 haalanki, voton kii ginati abhi bhi antim charan main he or is vakt sena ke javaanon ke vot gine ja rahe hai
 Israel voted for the general election on September 17
 buudhvaar dopaher se vahaan par ginati shuru hui, jo abhi tak jari he
 No party is yet to get a majority in the counting that has been done till Thursday afternoon
 isroyal akhbaar Haaretz ke anusaar, abhi tak kul 91 fisadi vot gine ja chuke hai
 Benny Gantz's Cahol Levan is leading in 32 seats out of 120 seats in Parliament, and Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party is leading in 31 seats
 agar gathbandhan kii baat karen to netanyahu kii aguwai vaala gathbandhan 55 or baini gantz ke gathbandhan ke paas kul 56 siten hai
 Apart from this, Secular Yisrael Betenu Party has won 9 seats
 yisaroyal betenu party ke netaa or purv raksha mantri avindor liberman is chunaav main kingmekar ban sakate hai
 a similar claim was claimed in exit polls
 bataa den ki isse pehle april main bhi isroyal main aam chunaav hue the, tab bhi kuch aise hi halaat bane the
 Benjamin Netanyahu was not able to prove a majority in Parliament then, which is why there are re-elections within 6 months
 agar ab is baar kii baat karen to abhi tak kisi ko bahumat nahin mila he, yahaan agar unity sarkaar yani paksh-vipaksh kii milijuli sarkaar banati he to phir bahumat ke masale par dikkat aa sakati he
 If the elected prime minister is unable to prove a majority, Israel can once again go to the polls

 But the truth was different
 darasal, sajid kaa pehle se ek vivaahit mahila ke saath prem prasang chal rahaa tha
 When her marriage was finally settled, the two lovers decided to run away quietly without telling the family
 or sajid shaadi se thik do din pehle 3 bacchon kii maa apni premika ke saath faraar ho gaya

 But only the eminent people of the mediating society objected to this marriage
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki ladke waalon ne nikaah ko gudde-gudiyon kaa khel bana diya he
 They have mocked Nikah with the girl and now it cannot be Nikah

 On the other hand, the dreams of the bride became a girl

 ’ a Pakistan High Court on Friday expressed its inability to convict President Asif Ali Zardari in the contempt case of the court
 ucch nyaayalay ne jaradaari ke do padon par asin rahane sambandhi ek maamle main apane hi aadesh ko dhata bataate hue kaha ki vah raashtrapati hone ke naate aarope se bari hone ke hakdaar hai
 According to the newspaper Dawn, during the hearing of the petition related to the contempt of court, on Friday, the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court Omar Ata Bandial said that although the court can convict any person who is contempt, the Article of the Constitution 248 (2) provides for the discharge of the President
 lahore ucch nyaayalay raashtrapati jaradaari ke khilaaf adaalat kii avmaananaa sambandhi jis yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahaa tha, usamen kaha gaya he ki isi adaalat dwaara pichley varsh die gaye faisle ke alok main unhone raajnneetik pad nahin choda he
 The petitioner's counsel AK Dogar said that the High Court and the Supreme Court can convict the contemptor of the court
 vakil ne raashtrapati ko aropamukt kiye jane kii avadharana par sawaal uthaaya or poocha ki agar raashtrapati kisi kii hatya kar de tab us sthiti main kya ho saktaa he
 The petitioner said that if the President is not convicted and sentenced to contempt of court, he will discount the concept of an independent judiciary
 is par adaalat kii khandpeeth ne kaha ki raashtra kaa pramukh haalanki kisi vyakti ke prati uttaradaayi nahin he, phir bhi vah nyaayik adeshon kaa sammaan or paalan karne ke liye baadhya he
 On September 5, the bench summoned a reply by issuing a fresh notice to President Zardari
 yachika main daleel di gai thi ki adaalat ke aadesh kii avhelnaa par raashtrapati ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaarywahi shuru kii jaae
 The comments gauratlab he ki jaradaari sattarudh pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke sah-adhyaksh hai or unke bete bilaval bhutto jaradaari party ke adhyaksh hai
 The petition alleged that President Zardari, while holding the highest office of the country, is involved in political activities
 kaha gaya he ki dohare pad ke khilaaf lahore ucch nyaayalay kii purnpeeth dwaara die gaye faisle ke baavjood raashtrapati ne khud ko na to raajnneetik pad se alag kiya he or na hi raashtrapati bhawan kaa 'durupyog' karnaa band kiya he
 The High Court defied its own order in a case related to Zardari's two terms, saying he, as President, was entitled to be acquitted of the charge
 samachar patr don ke anusaar, adaalat kii avmaananaa maamle se sambandhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan shuukravaar ko lahore ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish umr ata bandiyaal ne kaha ki adaalat haalanki avmaananaa karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko doshi qaraar de sakati he, lekin samvidhan ke anuchhed 248(2) ke tahat raashtrapati ko aropamukt kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The Lahore High Court was hearing a contempt petition against President Zardari for contempt of court, stating that he has not left the political post in the light of the judgment given by this court last year
 yachikakarta ke vakil eke dogaar ne kaha ki ucch nyaayalay or sarvocch nyaayalay adaalat kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko doshi qaraar de sakate hai
 The lawyer questioned the concept of exonerating the President and asked what could happen if the President killed someone
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki yadi raashtrapati ko doshi qaraar nahin diya jaataa he or adaalat kii avmaananaa karne kii sajaa unhen nahin sunai jaati he to isse swatantra nyaaypalika kii avadharana ko batta lagegaa
 To this the court bench said that although the head of the nation is not liable to any person, he is bound to respect and obey judicial orders
 paanch sitambar ko khandpeeth ne raashtrapati jaradaari ko ek nayaa notice jari kar jawaab talab kiya tha
 The petition argued that contempt proceedings be initiated against the President in violation of the court order
 tippaniyan Significantly, Zardari is the co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and his son Bilawal Bhutto is the president of the Zardari party
 yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki raashtrapati jaradaari desh ke sarvocch pad par rahete hue raajnneetik gatividhiyon main lipt hai
 It is said that despite the judgment given by the full bench of the Lahore High Court against the double post, the President has neither disassociated himself from the political post nor stopped 'misusing' Rashtrapati Bhavan

 par shaayad hi kabhi yah jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai ki ham jo bolte hai uskaa koi nishchit turm he yaa nahin
 In English, there are many terms for sentences said to be circumstantial
 aaj ham aapako aise hi 6 terms ke bare main bataane ja rahe hai
 1: Monelog: It is a speech or talk in which a person expresses his mind in a loud voice or by shouting

 Example- He is as skinny as a toothpick
 4: alujanisamen kisi sthaan, vyakti yaa vastu, chaahe vah kalpanik ho yaa vaastavik, ke bare main kaha jaataa he
 The reference given during this is a way of explaining your point to the front
 udhaaharan- you are a solomon when it comes to making decisions (refers to the wisdom of king solomon)5: peradoxise vaakya main tab prayog kiya jaataa he jab do vipareet vishay vaali chizon kaa udhaaharan dekar baat ko or adhik gaharaai se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa ho
 Example- Deep down, you're really shallow

 jidipi main giravat or notebandi par arabiai ke aankade saamne aane ke baad bijepi or congress ke bich raajnneeti shuru ho gai he
 At the same time, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Congress leader Randeep Surjewala came face to face on Friday about the resignations being taken from the ministers
 bataa den ki donon netaa aaj gujarat daure par the
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said in Valsad that the Prime Minister would expand the cabinet, but according to the way demonetisation and GDP have damaged the economy, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi should resign
 iske jawaab main kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se manufaccharing sector kii raftaar main kami ai he
 Due to which the GDP declined
 prasad ne vipaksh ke notebandi asafal hone ke aarope par kaha ki jisane bhrashtachar khatm karne ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya wo ab vilaap kar rahe hai
 He said that 3 lakh companies had been identified, which were doing hawala work

 Registration of 76 lakh companies has been canceled

 Voting for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 has been completed and the results are yet to come
 chunaav ke baad agsit pole ke nattejey jari ho chuke hai jinamein kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi gathbandhan ko baari bahumat milane ja rahaa he
 However, the leaders of the parties for whom the exit poll results are not favorable, are now talking about the failure of exit polls in various countries
 unke mutabik, 2016 main america main agsit pole ke nattejey sahi sabit nahin hue the
 Estimates regarding a referendum in Britain on the issue of separation from the European Union in 2016 were also incorrect
 isi tarah pichley hi shanivaar australia main sansadeey chunaav ke nateezon ne bhi agsit pole ko dhata de diya tha, lekin in alag- alag deshon main hue chunaav or anumaan, kya bharat main chunaavon ko lekar jari agsit pole kii hi tarah hai?india today data intelligence unit ne in teen chunaavon kii padtaal kii or paaya ki bracit ko chhodkar, america or australia ke chunaav kaa tarika bhartiya chunaav se ekadam alag he
 The method of election in India is not found at all with the election methods of these countries
 doosraa in donon ke opinian pole or nattejey dikhaate hai ki pratiyogiyon main behad kadaa muqabla tha, jahaan bhavishyavaanee yaa anumaan kii gunjaaish behad kam thi, lekin bharat main aisa nahin he
 There is scope for inference here
 america, bracit or australia main kadaa muqabladata intelligence unit ne in teen deshon ke agsit pole ke aankadon kii padtaal main paaya ki jahaan bharat main sabhi agsit pole ek hi disha main anumaan vyakt kar rahe hai, vahiin america, bracit or austrailia ke chunaav main behad kareebi muqabla tha, jisase anumaan lagaana kaaphi mushkil tha
 US Opinion Poll Most opinion polls in the US general election in 20162016 projected very small differences between Trump and Hillary Clinton in popular votes
 agsit pole karne vaali abisi news kii jaani maani agency 538 ne kaha tha ki hillari clinton ke raashtrapati banane ke 71
 There is a 4 per cent probability
 vahi neuyork times ke apshot sarv ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki clinton ke jeetne kii 85 fisadi sambhaavna he
 At the same time, the Princeton Election Consortium had announced through its electoral mathematics that the probability of Hillary Clinton becoming President is 99 percent
 6 november 2016 ke ek lekh main to ye bhi likhaa gaya ki ‘agar hillari nahin jitati hai to ye ek bada aashcharya hoga’’aakhirkaar chunaav nattejey ko dekhen to hillari clinton ko 48
 5 per cent and trump 46
 4 fisadi vot mili, lekin america main electroral college system jaisi jatil chunavi prakriya ke chalate trump chunaav jeetne main safal rahe
 However, the margin of victory between the two in the final results was still modest
 nateezon ke baad princeton ellection consortium ke liye clinton kii jeet par lekh likhane vaale vaigyanik sam vaing ne neuyork main kaha ‘ ye chunaav bilkul viparit the or pehle ke raashtrapati chunaavon main aisa nahin dekha gaya
 'brexit The same happened in the 2016 Brexit election
 britain ke europea sangh main shaamil hone or usase alag hone vaale logon kii sankhya main bahut kam antar tha
 Therefore, there was a tough fight between the two sides
 22 june 2016 ko 6 opinian pols kiye gaye
 One of these leading research consultants 'populous' was confident that Britain would stay with the European Union
 uske mutabik 55 fisadi logon ne haq main vot daale or 45 fisadi logon ne khilaaf mat diye donon ke bich sidhe sidhe 10 % kaa antar tha
 At the same time, two andopenians said that Britain would break away from the European Union, although their sample size was smaller than 'populus', the margin of victory was only 1 to 2 percent
 kareeb 52 fisadi logon ne britain ke alag hone ke liye vot kiya or 48 fisadi ne saath rahane ke paksh main vot kiya
 But here the difference between the estimates and the actual results was very small
 australian chunaav 2019haal hi main australia kaa chunaav hua or pichley shanivaar ko uske nattejey ghoshit hue
 There was a lot of discussion on social media about this election
 congress netaa shashi tharur ne twitor par likhaa ki austrailia main zyaadaatar agsit pole ne galat anumaan lagaaya tha or matganana ke din bharat main bhi agsit pole karaane vaale galat sabit honge
 In Australia's exit poll, all the agencies had estimated the difference of only two per cent of the vote between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party
 vahaan kii pramukh chunavi survey agency roy morgan ne daawa kiya tha ki lebar party ko 78 siten milengi or wo sarkaar banaaengi
 In Australia, the voting system is quite different, there is a two party system
 chaar bade agsit pols ne kaha ki 52 fisadi vot lebar party ko jaaenge jabaki 48 fisadi vot libral party ko
 At the same time, when the results came, the Liberal Party got 1 percent more votes
 australia main 150 siten hai jahaan sarkaar banane ke liye 76 siten chahie hoti hai
 The Liberals have got 77 seats for the party, which means only one seat more than the required seats
 isse samajha ja saktaa he ki yahaan bhi muqabla kaante kaa tha
 For Indian elections, such as those in the US, Australia and Brexit, to be the same in India, it would require a tough fight between the contesting candidates, but this is not the case
 sabhi bhartiya agsit pole agenciyon ne bijepi gathbandhan ko spasht bahumat kaa anumaan vyakt kiya he, vah bhi kareeb 100 siton ke antar se
 Most of the times these agencies have been able to guess the party or coalition that is gaining edge
 yahaan tak bhartiya agsit pole agenciyaan yah anumaan to sahi laga leti hai ki vijeta koun hone ja rahaa he, lekin seat or vot share ke bare main ve anumaan lagane se kai baar chook jaati hai
 In terms of vote share and seats, the results are often completely different
 jaankaron kii raay bantiegsit pole ko lekar bharat main kya nattejey ho sakate hai iske liye DIU ne desh ke bade chunavi jaankaron se baat kii jo is mudde par bante hue hai
 Fellow Rahul Verma of the Center for Policy Research believes that comparing India and Australia is like comparing between apples and oranges
 verma kehete hai ‘jab kareebi muqabla hota he to nattejey galat ho sakate hai
 The US and Australia elections are examples of this, but the situation in India is reversed
 aitihaasik taur par bharat main sahi vijeta kaa elaan kar diya jaataa he or is baar bhi bijepi ke netritv main gathbandhan aage he
 'former election expert and now BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao also believes the same
 "agsit pole main gadabadi kii sambhaavna rahati he jab bahut kareebi muqabla ho
 All the polls in 2019 are showing the NDA ahead of its opponents, such leads clearly indicate what is the mood of the public, there is no scope of error in it ", another Niljanan government of CPR believes Like Australia and Britain, the situation in India may change and the results may change on 23 May
 haalanki ham aapako bataa den ki ajtak- exis maai india ne abtak 95 fisadi agsit pole sahi bataae hai
 Now everyone's eyes are on 23 May

 i have told you many times with figures that a few good days have come in this country
 baaki jinako iskaa intjaar tha unki aashaa par yah kahkar pani pher diya gaya ki achche din kii baat nahin kahi gai thi
 The political effort of packaging, he said, will thus withdraw from the promises made during the Lok Sabha elections one by one

 Still, when it comes to election preparations, the Congress seems to be lagging behind in Odisha
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) yahaan apni taiyaari kaaphi pehle shuru kar chuki he
 However, party president Amit Shah is still lagging behind in the election race as his health is deteriorating
 unki jagah pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apana puraa damakham dikhaaya he or beete 2 maheene main teen baar odisha kaa daura kar chuke hai
 There is also speculation that Narendra Modi may contest the Lok Sabha elections from Odisha
 sawaal he ki jis odisha main bijepi ne apni puri takat jhonk rakhi he, vahaan congress kii chaal itani dhimi kyon he? kya congress ko lag gaya he ki aglaa chunaav 'duubati naiya' he jise sab chhod kar bhaage ja rahe hai? jaisaa ki pichley kuch ghatnakram gavaah hai, desh kii ati pracheen party congress ke kai netaaon main naaraazgi he or kuch party ko alavida bhi kah chuke hai
 On this, the political pundits say that the disturbance in the Odisha Congress is pointing to a cracking fort because if it does not happen then it would have never been the Union Minister and the firebrand leader of the state Srikanth Jena is not shown such a way out
 kai vidhayak chhod chuke hai partiodisha main congress se khaar khaae netaaon main jena akele nahin hai
 In this month of the new year, only 25 days have elapsed and the Congress is in a tizzy that the mlas are also resigning
 yogesh singh or naba kishor das kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 It is not that the 'indiscipline' of these mlas that Congress has just seen was not there before
 jena, yogesh singh or kishor das jaise netaa kai dinon se aagaah kar rahe the or mukammal karrwai kii maang kar rahe the lekin rahul gandhi odisha ke liye samay nahin nikaal paae
 16 Congress mlas were elected
it is also certain that Rahul Gandhi's party manager will be giving every information of Odisha to him
 pehle or ab main kya fark he, unhen jarur pataa hoga
 However, in the last election in the 147 assembly seats of Odisha, the Congress won only 16 and in the 21-member Lok Sabha, the Congress could not get a single seat
 isse andaja lagaana saaf he ki congress pehle hi sarender kar chuki he
 The remaining hopes are getting dimmed because the speculation of Prime Minister Modi fighting there is intensified
 to kya ye maane ki rahul gandhi or unki party congress agle loksabhaa sah vidhansabha (sambhaavna he donon chunaav saath hon) chunaavon main asal ladaai bijedy banaam bijepi maan rahi he? maamla kuch aisa hi he tabhi congress vidhayakon kii sankhya bhi simatati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, why would any party allow its president to bet on losing bets? jena ne bigaada khelpurv kendriya mantri or kabhi congress ke kaddavar netaa rahe shrikant jena ab apni party se bedakhal ho chuke hai
 He is evicted, but his attitude is not lax
 is tevar kii gambhirtha kaa andaja isse laga sakate hai ki jena ne khuleam elaan kiya ki ve rahul gandhi kaa 'asli cheharaa' logon ke bich rakhenge
 It is to be noted here that Jena did not go alone, along with Koraput MLA Krishna Chandra Sagaria
 jena ne lagaae hai gambhir aaropgena ke aaropon par gaur karen to isaki gambhirtha samaj main aegi or yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki odisha congress kis khalabali se jujh rahi he
 Jena said, "rahul Gandhi has made it clear that he will support the mining mafia
" odisha pradesh congress cameti jo kabhi utkalmani gopbandhu das ke saath thi, aaj khanan mafia ke haathon khel rahi he
 We caught the attention of Rahul Gandhi many times about this but he did not notice
 ' jena ne kaaphi chaturaai se gopbandhu das kaa naam liya he kyonki das ko odisha kaa gandhi kaha jaataa he or odisha ke is gandhi kii shoharat airi-gairi nahin, balki saamaajik kaaryakarta, sudhaarak, raajnneetik activist, patrkaar, kavi or nibandhkaar ke rup main rahi he
 So, Jena has targeted the Congress of Gopabandhu Das as the Mining Mafia Congress and has hit many targets simultaneously
 ab congress ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki pehle chunavi raily karen yaa jate hue netaaon ko roke
 Dharmendra Pradhan adamant and Congress lagged behind, see Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's activity to know what the BJP is preparing in Odisha
 pradhan vahiin se aate hai lekin rajyasabha main hone ke baavjood unka zyaadaatar samay odisha main gujarata he
 His image is clean and his works are also being counted
 gas ke kshetra main kai project shuru hue hai rus jaise tel-gas pradhan deshon ke saath ahm samjhaute hue hai
 Seeing the distance, BJP set Pradhan in Odisha much earlier, while the Congress has not been able to bring any big leader there
 ab rahul kii yah raily netaaon ko ekajute kar paaegi yaa nahin yah dekhnaa hoga
 Significantly, the Delhi government said that AAP workers will also be deployed to implement the odd-even formula

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane intervyuu main kaha tha ki pakistan ek ladaai se sudhar jayega, yah maananaa badi bhul hogi
 Reacting to PM Modi's statement, Islamabad has said that India needs to change its aggressive attitude on Pakistan
 bharat ne ek yuddh kaa parinaam dekha he phir bhi uske rukh main koi badlaav nahin aayaa, 100 yuddh ho jaae phir koi badlaav nahin aayega
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor, in an interview to news channel ARI, said that there is an election environment in India
 vahaan pakistan ke naam par chunaav hote hai
 But this is not the case in Pakistan
 jang kii baat bharat ne kii he
 India has seen the result of a war, yet its attitude has not changed, even 100 wars will not come
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ne aman kii baat kii he
 India's threats have no effect on us
 asif gafoor ne kaha ki pakistan kai baar kah chukaa he ki aman kii taraf janaa chahie
 Threats of war (especially on a strong princely state like Pakistan) will not be resolved and have never happened
 pakistan apane bachaav ke liye sakasham he
 Explain that despite the surgical strike, on the question of violation of the ceasefire from across the border, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that whether it was a war of 1965 or 1971, a fight would improve Pakistan, it would be a big mistake to think
 pakistan ko sudharne main abhi or samay lagegaa
 Although the Prime Minister also said that India is always ready to negotiate with Pakistan, but the sound of dialogue cannot be heard in the noise of bombs and guns
 sargical strike kii vishwaneeyata par ek baar sawaal uthaate hue pakistan sena ke pravaktaa asif gafoor ne kaha ki unke apane log nahin maanate, ab tak bharat ne koi saboot nahin diya, sirf baton se sargical strike nahin hoti
 Even their drones cannot come in our region
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko pakistani sena ne daawa kiya tha ki usne bharat kaa ek drone maar giraaya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the 46th Indian Labor Conference on Monday
 unhone desh ke shramikon or maalikon ke bich 'parivaar bhav' sthapit karne kii vakaalat kii or kanoonon ko sahaj banane kaa vaada kiya
 The Prime Minister said that the contribution of labor is in the creation of the nation and it is the farmers and laborers who make the country
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki shramik sapanom kii aahuti dekar dusron ke sapane puraa karata he
 If he is unhappy, how will the country be happy
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki maalik or shramik ke bich agar parivaar bhav paidaa hota he to vikaas kii yatra ko koi roak nahin saktaa
 He said that all these discussions should also be studied scientifically
 unhone shram karne waalon ke prati aadar bhav laane kii vakaalat kii
 Kyon bhai? Yeh farak kyon? Dignity of labor, shramik ka samman zaroori hai
 : PM Modi
 - ANI (@ani_news) July 20, 2015 The Prime Minister said, 'there are many small and big industries which are 50 years old, but there has never been any strike in them
 iskaa kya kaaran hoga? use chalaane vaale logon kii soch kya hogi? unhone kis tarah se shramikon se naata joda he
 Can we show a sample that has been going on for 50 years, thousands of workers, never a complaint

 The immune cells of our body, ie immune cells, help in fighting the cancerous malignant cells
 isse marij kii beemaari se ladane kii takat itani majboot ho jaati he ki vah cancer kaa muqabla kar saktaa he
 Cancer is the second largest cause of death in India after heart diseases
 iske alaava bharat main 2018 main cancer ke kaaran 8
 17 percent of deaths occurred
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, 2020 tak desh main vibhinn prakaar ke cancer ke kaaran 8
 There may be 8 lakh deaths and the figure is projected to double by 2030
 chaunkaa dene vaale ye aankade visheshgyon ko prerit kar rahe hai ki cancer ke ilaaj ke liye immunotherapy jaisi kuch aadhunik takneekon ko badhaava den
 Dr
 Ajit Saxena gave information about the benefits of immunotherapy at a press conference organized by Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals
 dow saxena nai dilli ke indraprastha apollo hospitals main urology ke senior cancelatent hai
 He explained the disadvantages of conventional treatment of cancer, saying, "chemotherapy is commonly used to treat cancer, especially when the cancer is in advanced stage
 haalanki iskaa sabase bada nuksaan yah he ki yah swasthkoshikaonour cancer kii koshikaon ke bich antar nahin kar saktaa, jiske kaaran sharir kii swasth koshikaayen bhi nasht ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, the strength to fight against the diseases of the body, which is already weak, becomes even more weak
 "dow manish singhl jo apollo hospitals, noida main senior cancelatent onchologist hai, unhone immunotherapy ke phaaydon par baat karte hue kaha, "bahut se logon ko immuno-onchology se phayda hua he
 Immune booster therapy is given keeping in mind the needs of every person
 immune cells vishesh rup se cancer kii koshikaon par hi hamalaa karti hai or sharir kii swasth koshikaon ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaati
 This not only reduces the chances of recurrence, but can also protect the patient from the side effects caused by traditional methods of treatment
 "dow saxena ne kaha, "yah jaruri he ki doctor immunotherapy ke kshetra main ho rahe shodh ko jaane or apane marijon ke ilaaj ke liye in therepiyon kaa istemaal karen
 Immuno-oncology is a modern method of treatment in which a person's own immune system is used to fight the disease
 duniyabar main doctor or shodhakarta is kshetra se jude vibhinn pahaluon par adhyayan kar rahe hai
 It is important that doctors treating advanced stage cancer patients learn about this technique
 yah onchology kaa bhavishya he
 Through this conference, we want to make not only the common people but also the medical community aware about the modern techniques of cancer treatment

 * 1978 main ek film ai thi vishwanath, jisamen hero kii bhoomika main the shatrughna sinha
 a dialogue of this film became very popular
 jali ko aag kehete hai, buji ko raakh kehete hai, jis raakh se barood bane, use vishwanath kehete hai
 There was a sense of revenge in the character that Shatrughan Sinha filmed
 ek baar phir usee kirdaar main shatrughna sinha najar aana chaahate hai lekin raajnneeti ke maidan main
 Quitting his years-old party when Shatrughan Sinha joined the Congress and the manner in which he lashed out at the current leaders of the BJP, he got a clear indication of this
 shatrughna sinha shanivaar congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Like the script of the film, its story was being written for a long time
 pichley kai varshon se shatrughna sinha bijepi ke netritv se naakhush the
 From time to time, his involvement in many parties was also speculated but eventually he joined the Congress
 is maukey par shatrughna sinha ne narendra modi, amit shah par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki bijepi main unhone lok shahi ko dhire-dhire taanaashaahee main parivartit hote dekha
 Shatrughan Sinha said that the incumbent BJP leadership has dealt with strong personalities like Yashwant Sinha, Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Shourie
 shatrughna sinha ne apane dil main dabe dard ko bhi bayaan kiya
 Shatrughan Sinha asked why he was not made a minister in the BJP government
 unhone kaha ki kya unke andar kaabiliyat nahin yaa phir unke andar kya kami thi
 Shatrughan Sinha said that at the moment there is a dictatorial government in the BJP
 unhone kaha ki ye van main sho or tu main army kii sarkaar he
 Shatru said that Union ministers were not allowed to have their own secretary
 mana ja rahaa he ki shatrughna sinha apni puraani seat patna sahib se hi congress ke tikat par chunaav ladenge or unka muqabla bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad se hoga
 Shatrughan Sinha's attack will now openly hit back
 jis prakaar vah bijepi par joardaar hamalaa bol rahe hai ab unpar bhi javaabi hamalaa hoga
 Now it will be seen whether he will become 'vishnnath' by winning the upcoming elections or will make his old party 'silent'

 veepi singh sarkaar ke patan ke baad saal 1990 main tatkaaleen raashtrapati aar venkataramana chaahate the ki pranab mukherjee pradhanmantri bane lekin rajeev gandhi kuch or hi soch rahe the
 This claim has been made in the book 'the Chinar Leaves' by Makhanlal Fotedar, a senior Congress leader and loyalist of the Gandhi family
 kitaab main photedaar ne likhaahai ki 1990 main jab veepi singh ke istife ke sambandh main raajnneetik sthiti par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye unhone raashtrapati venkataramana se mulaakaat kii to raashtrapati ne jor dete hue unase kaha tha ki rajeev ko mukherjee kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 Rajiv Gandhi, the leader of the largest party, wrote: 'I met President Venkataraman and discussed the political situation with him
 maine unhen bataaya ki vartmaan halaat main kevalcongress partihi samaaj ke har varg ko saath lekar chal sakati he or ek majboot va sthir sarkaar de sakati he
 'he further wrote' i urged him to invite Rajiv to lead the next government as Rajiv was the leader of the single largest party in the Lok Sabha
 is par raashtrapati ne mujhe jor dete hue kaha ki mujhe rajeev gandhi ko yah bataanaa chahie ki agar vah pradhanmantri pad ke liye pranab mukherjee kaa samarthan karte hai to vah (raashtrapati) usee shaam unhen pad kii shapath dilaayenge
 'coming soon' This book published by the bookherper Collins is going to come soon in the market
 kitaab main bataaya gaya he ki jab tak rajeev gandhi ko apana raajnneetik uttaradhikari banane kaa vichaar indira gandhi ke dimag main nahin aayaa tha tab tak vah sochati thim ki mukherjee, pivi narsingh raav or venkataramana unke baad congress party kii bagdor sambhaal sakate hai
 Foteedar, a former assistant to Indira Gandhi, has told in the book that Madhavrao Scindia, who aspires to the post of Prime Minister, changed Mulayam Singh Yadav's opinion about supporting the Congress-led coalition government after the Vajpayee government fell by one vote in 1999
 How Amar Singh was used
 sonia ke is kaam se kai congressi the khafawajpeyi sarkaar ke girane ke baad pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par sonia kii ore se manmohan singh kaa naam liye jane ke bare main photedaar ne kitaab main likhaa he ‘party main kai logon ko jab pataa chalaa ki sonia ji kii pehali pasand dow
 If Singh is, some people got teary-eyed and Madhav Rao Scindia, who has ambitions for the Prime Minister's post, used his friend Amar Singh to change Mulayam Singh Yadav's thinking about supporting the Congress-led coalition government
 ’unhone likhaa he ‘sonia ji tab chunavi raajnneeti main nahin thim
 He met the President and claimed that his party had the support of 272 Lok Sabha members
 raashtrapati se unki mulaakaat ke thik pehle ek dilachasp vakya hua
 The original letter that Sonia wanted to hand over to the President indicated that Dr
 manmohan singh party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge
 However i advised him to remove Singh's name and insist on calling the party to lead a coalition government
 is tark ko sonia ji ne saraahaa or vah kiya jisaki jarurat thi
 It was the thinking behind making Manmohan Singh the PM
 Regarding Manmohan Singh, who was elected to the post of Prime Minister, Fotedar said that this choice revealed Sonia Gandhi's 'clever political thinking' because Singh had no political base and He could never be a threat to their leadership
 saath hi vah sikh samudaay se sambhddha the jo oparation bluestar or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue dangon ke kaaran gandhi parivaar se atyadhik naaraaz tha

 bijepi ne kaha ki yah faisla saajha nunatam kaarykram (siempi) ke aadhaar par nahin he, jis par jammu-kashmir main gathbandhan sarkaar chal rahi he
 But PDP is insisting that it is in line with CMP
 pradesh bijepi pramukh or saansad jugal kishor sharma ne bataaya ki yah faisla karne se pehle unki party se vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya gaya he
 He said that senior BJP leaders of the state met here today to discuss the issue and his party will convey their displeasure to the PDP leadership and ask them to follow the coalition religion
 sharma ne kaha ki bijepi ne mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said or unki party ke faisle ko ekatarfa bataaya he or party isse kaaphi aahat hui he
 Indeed, a major controversy has arisen with the release of the radical separatist leader
 unhone kaha ki said ne alam ko reeha karne kaa faisla lene se pehle apane gathbandhan saajhedaar bijepi ko vishwaas main nahin liya
 He told reporters, "we were not informed or informed before his release

 We have decided to express our displeasure to our partner so that such things do not happen in future
 ' On the other hand, PDP Spokesperson and Education Minister Naeem Akhtar said that the decision is in line with the CMP referring to the involvement of all partners to establish peace in Jammu and Kashmir
 akhtar ne bataaya, 'ise (alam kii rihaai ko) upyukt sandarbh main dekhnaa hoga
 Involving all partners in the state and across the border for reconciliation and peace is an important part of our Common Minimum Program
