 aakhirkaar pakistani fouj ‘‘profeshnal’’ ho hi gai
 It does not mean "devilish"
 ‘‘rajya ke bheetar ek or rajya’’ bhi nahin
 This is all about 1999
 fouj ab siyaasi abhadrataayen nahin karti
 Everything is left behind
 nai fouj ‘‘arajanatik’’ he or waapas apni ‘baiyrakon main laut chuki he
 'no coup
 koi sidhaa dakhal nahin
 There is no statement that raises the ground of Pakistan
 koi aisa kadam nahin jisase nason main siharan paidaa hoti ho yaa share bazaar gir jate hon yaa phir bharat ke faujee daston main halchal much jaati ho
 And these things are being heard here
 aadhikarik rup se-saarvajanik manchon par or tok sho main-yahaan tak ki drawing room or cigar lounj kii mulakaaton main bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistani fouj ab mulk kii khidamat main jute gai he
 In fact, the Colonel of the Pakistani army is working hard to sell his new phrase of politics less and more work, and some of the lesser number of captains and majors standing in the first queues have accepted him
 vyavhaar main dekhen to kul 65 saal baad yah badlaav takreeban puraa ho chukaa he
 Today, the Pakistan Army is the largest political party in its country and the fifth largest in the world
 kuch hi hafte bache hai or general ashfak parvej kayaani desh ke uthapatak vaale itihaas main pehali baar ek loktantric sarkaar se duusari tak le jane vaale chunaav karvaa rahe honge
 Of course, who else but the military can calmly guarantee the election
 isliye aisa lag saktaa he ki pakistan kaa kukhyat or vikhandit maansikta vaale loktantr, yaa kahen loktantrheenta kaa vikaar antat: rawalpindi mukhyalay ke vardidhariyon ne hi suljhaayaa, islamabad ke sherwani-salwar vaale manovigyaani is kaam na aae
 This metamorphosis, however, is not theoretical
 darasal kuch or gata he, kuch aisa jiskaa ham sab ko intjaar tha
 This is a very complex leap from the narrow path of command and control politics to the leadership scenario
 haal main afghanistan kii sarhad ke paas meri mulaakaat ek durlabh kism ke faujee se hui
 The ISI sector commander was just like any Pakistani James Bond: nationalist, tough on India, skeptical of the US, alert to the Taliban, guerrilla warfare and proud to cross the border
 hamaari baatcheet jab loktantr or rajkaaj par pahunchi, to chhavnee main maujuud sabhi kii ore dikhaate hue vah bolaa, ‘‘ye hamaara nahin, aapkaa kaam he
 Go do your work ’’ pakistan main 11 may ko chunaav hone vaale hai or sabase acchhee baat yahi he ki uske faujee ab rajnatik tatasthta kaa pradarshan sikh chuke hai
 This change has not happened suddenly

 Because of this, his hero and leader Pervez Musharraf had to be swayed by the theoretically correct Brutus: that is, this change has taken place due to the society and active civic institutions of the Islamic Republic
 yani aaj ke pakistan main koi ek nahin, kai jaadugar hai or inamen kisi ko bhi ab sirf khaaki pahanakar jeene kii chhot nahin he

 vah mahatvakankshi nahin, anushaasit hone kii baat karegaa
 And he would like to meet in a rich private library, not this time in a hotel room
 vah aapse siyasat nahin, polo kii baat karegaa
 He will not complain to your editor but will praise you
 or lagaataar apni baatcheet main vah aise jumale uchhaalega jo aam taur se harvard yaa brookings univasti main sune jate hai
 He will talk about consultations and conflict, on trade treaties and resettlement, on regional military cooperation and mutual peace restoration

 lekin jahaan tak afghanistan-pakistan ke ragade kaa sawaal he, unhen lagata he ki unki fatah hui he
 And they are probably right too

 Will the former Union Minister Kamalanatham contest his candidature in the Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in a few months? This question is arising because Nathmeen Nath himself has indicated to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 chhindwara main yojit ek kaaryakarta sammelan main kamalnath ne kaha ki jarurat padi to wochhindwaraki kisi bhi seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 When reporters asked a 9-time MP from Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat and currently Madhya Pradesh Congress President Kamal Nath during an event, when asked questions related to his candidature from the assembly elections, Kamal Nath said that he has not decided anything about it, but has decided yet Whether they should become candidates from Chhindwara or not
 kamalnath yaheen nahin ruke
 He further said that if he had to contest elections, he would have Chhindwara, Sauncer, Chaudai
 teenon hi siten hai
 When Kamal Nath was asked about his son Nakulnath contesting the election, he replied that he would discuss it with his son
 saansad kamalnath ke vidhansabha chunaav ladane ko bijepi ne unka demoshan bataaya he
 In the Shivraj government, PWD Minister Rampal Singh lashed out at Kamal Nath and said that he is a big leader

 This is an injustice to them
 isse pehle bhuriya ji ko laae the lekin haalat dekh lijie
 Kamal Nath has kept himself away from contesting the assembly elections so far, if he contests the assembly elections, the contest is likely to be interesting

 He made the highest headlines in the state

 He was the Deputy Chief Minister in the Jharkhand government at that time
 unhone arjuna munda sarkaar ko gira diya
 It was Hemant who persuaded his father and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) president Shibu Soren to withdraw support from the BJP government
 lihaaja, munda ko 8 janvari ko istipha dena padaa
 At that time everyone expected Hemant to form the government, but the Congress refused to support him
 iske ek hafte baad rajya ko ek baar phir raashtrapati shashan ke daur main janaa padaa
 Analyst Hemant was deemed a loser, who miscalculated about the Congress
 raashtrapati shashan ke liye vishleshak jeemem kaa majaak udaate rahe
 But without thinking about all these things, Hemant kept on trying to become the chief minister
 ve congress ke kendriya netritv se samarthan kii sweekruti hasil karne ke liye jute rahe
 Hemant presented before him the benefits of the congress-jmm alliance
 aakhirkaar chah maah baad unki mehnat rang laai or congress samarthan dene ko raji ho gai
 On July 13, 38-year-old Hemant was sworn in as the state's ninth chief minister
 hemanth ne jabardast santulan kaayam kiya, jiskaa puraa shrey unhen hi jaataa he
 He was successful in inducting Congress into the cabinet
 yahaan pehali baar aisa ho rahaa tha
 In the past, the Congress had supported the government of Shibu in 2005 and 2008 and Madhu Koda in 2006, but did not join the government
 sarkaar kii sthirataa ke liye ve congress tak hi simit nahin rahe balki argedy ko bhi sarkaar main le aae
 This was the first time since the separation of Congress and RJD in 2009 that the two joined hands to help the Hemant government
 july main donon ke bich aae is siyaasi badlaav kaa sirf sthaneey prabhaav nahin rahaa balki mushkil loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue donon main karibiyaan ban gai hai
 Perhaps this will also be seen in the political equation of Bihar
 yahi nahin, sarkaar main shaamil kiye bagaiyr, unhone nirdaliyon ko bhi samarthan dene ke liye manaa liya
 This also saved him from independent ministers who are known to exert pressure
 hemanth siyaasi mahatvakanksha vaale vyakti rahe hai
 He first contested the Dumka seat in the 2005 assembly elections, but lost to JMM rebel Stephen Marandi
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhone jeet darj kii

 In January 2013, he pulled out of the same government
 lekin jaisi safalataa unhone vibhinn rajnatik takaton ko ek saath laa hasil kii, waisi safalataa mukhyamantri ke rup main unke shashan main najar nahin ai he

 My friendship with Atal ji is 65 years old
 main khud ko saubhagyashaalee maanata hum ki meri atal ji se mitrataa 65 saalon se thi
 Speaking about Atalji's skill in cooking food, Advani said that he used to cook very good food, even if it is khichdi
 aaj unki anupasthiti main bolnaa pad rahaa he, jiskaa unhen gaharaa dukh he
 Sharing his experiences with Atal ji, former Prime Minister Advani said, 'I watched him closely

 We used to share our experiences with each other
 ham saath main cinema dekhte the

 jammu or kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne somvaar ko vidhansabha main afjal guru ke liye sammansoochak shabd kaa istemaal karte hue uske naam ke ant main 'sahib' jod diya
 Afzal Guru was hanged on 9 February after being convicted in the 2001 Parliament attack
 vipaksh ne somvaar ko vidhansabha main mukhyamantri par afjal guru kii jaan na bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 After this, Omar Abdullah's anger was worth seeing
 afjal guru maamle par vidhansabha main laae gaye sthagan prastaav par umr abdulla ne kaha ki yahaan aise bataaya ja rahaa he jaise main hi uski maut ke liye jimmedaar hum
 His (opposition's) speeches make it seem as if i put a noose around his neck and hanged him

 He said that Afzal Guru was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court in 2006
 us samay rajya sarkaar ne 21 dinon ke liye karfu lagaaya tha
 Strongly criticizing the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP), he said that the PDP wants to use such sentences for its vested interests
 use afjal guru ke parivaar or rajya ke logon ke liye thodi si bhi phikr nahin he
 They want to play a game of dirty politics on blood

 But after this step, the biggest challenge of the central government is how to prevent the new currency from being used once again to hide black money
 iske liye jaruri he ki vah desh mencashles vyavastaako teji ke saath aage badaye
 Due to this, the government reduced the import duty on machines used for shopping in the country (point of sale machines) 16
 5 fisadi sasta kar diya he
 After this step of the government, the way for many new decisions has been cleared in the coming days
 notebandi ke baad honge ye 5 faisle1
 All professional services in the country such as lawyers, doctors, chartered accountants, architects etc
 will be made necessary to get a connection to use the point of sale machine in their office

 Large cities (100 smart cities) can be chosen first to implement this decision
 3
 It can be made mandatory for all petrol, diesel and CNG pumps in the country to be equipped with ATM facility and sell fuel through point of sale machines
 in sabhi jagahon par digital pement suvidha pahunchane ke baad cash se kharidari par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla liya ja saktaa he
 4
 deshbhar main hotel, restaurant, baar, club, pub or khaane-pine kii sabhi dukaanon ko point of cell terminal kaa istemaal karne ke liye baadhya kar diya jaae
 However, in this decision, the government may give exemption for roadside tea and snacks for hawkers and khumkas cocash transactions
 5
 It can be decided for online retailers to sell their goods only through debit card, credit card, mobile wallet or other digital payment mediums
 iske liye vah cash on delavery jaise opshan par puri tarah se pratibandh lagane kaa faisla bhi le sakati he
 The University of Delhi has decided to remove the provision of 'special occasion' given to students who are not able to complete degree studies within the stipulated time
 'vishesh avasar' praavdhaan ke tahat bich main padhai chhodane vaale chaatro ko apni anupasthiti kaa tarksangat or uchit kaaran bataane par anumati di jaati thi ki ve varshon baad bhi lambit parikshaayen de saken
 The executive council (EC), the university's decision-making apex body, decided to remove the provision last week, stating that students should complete the degree on time
 isi ke sadsy ne kaha ki chaatr yahaan padhane aate hai
 Why can't he complete his degree on time? Comments unhone kaha ki yadi kisi 'vaazib' kaaran jaise ki swasthya sambandhi kaaran yaa shaadi kii vajah se chaatr kii badhaai baadhit hoti he to use ise puraa karne ke liye kuch atirikt samay die jane kaa praavdhaan pehle hi he
 He said that apart from this there is no need to be given opportunities
 is tarah, diu ke niyamanuar undergraduate chaatro ko naam darj karaane kii tithi se lekar chah saal ke bheetar apni degree puri kerani hogi jabaki snatakottar kii degree chaar saal main puri ho jaani chahie
 The provision, which had been the subject of debate for a decade, was removed in the year 2012, but was re-enacted after protests by students

 (agenciyon se input) He said that there is already a provision to give some extra time to complete it if a student is interrupted due to a 'legitimate' reason such as health reasons or marriage
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava avasar die jane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In this way, the regular undergraduate students of DU will have to complete their degree within six years from the date of enrollment while the postgraduate degree should be completed in four years
 ek dashak tak bahes kaa vishay rahaa yah praavdhaan varsh 2012 main hataa diya gaya tha, lekin chaatro ke virodh ke baad ise phir se lagu kiya gaya tha

 (agenciyon se input) Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi used cricket terminology to help the controversial former IPL chief Lalit Modi and foreign minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, saying the Congress was on a 'slippery pitch' And he should abandon the strategy of 'hit and run'
 sansadeey maamalon ke rajya mantri nakvi ne kaha ki asanmajas main padi congress har ghante nae aarope laga rahi he or sarkaar evam log samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki vah asal main chaahati kya he
 The comments nakvi ne kaha, congress party jab satta main thi, tab har din hit wicket out hoti thi
 Now that she is in opposition, putting a no ball
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki jab pich par phislan ho to rukkar intjaar karnaa chahie or phir khelnaa chahie
 He needs net practice to play the role of a constructive and effective opposition
 nakvi se sushamaa or vasundhara dwaara lalit modi kii britain main yatra dastavej hasil karne main madad karne ke maamle ko lekar tippanee karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Naqvi also said that the Congress will understand the role of positive opposition after 4-6 years of net practice
 unhone kaha, ek din party koi kaagaj lekar aegi or kahegi yah ek mahal se judaa dastavej he or agle din doosraa kaagaj lekar aegi or kahegi ki yah (lalit) modi kaa he or phir ek doosraa kaagaj laaegi
 He should determine what it is that he wants to surround the government with
 nakvi ne kaha, vah koi aarope laga rahe hai yaa yah chunchu kaa murabba he, yah saaf nahin he
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Naqvi said that the Congress, which was in a dilemma, is making new allegations every hour and the government and people are not able to understand what she really wants
 tippaniyan Naqvi said, when the Congress party was in power, there were hit wickets out every day
 ab jab vah vipaksh main he, to no ball daal rahi he
 They should understand that when the pitch is slippery, they should wait and play again
 unhen ek rachanaatmak evam prabhavi vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye net abhyaas kii jarurat he
 Naqvi was asked to comment on the case of Sushma and Vasundhara helping Lalit Modi obtain travel documents in Britain 
 nakvi ne saath hi kaha ki congress 4-6 saal ke net abhyaas ke baad sakaaratmak vipaksh kii bhoomika samaj jaaegi

 Because Barack Obama was going to sit 112 minutes under the open sky on the same Rajpath
 azaad hindustan ke itihaas main rajpath kii suraksha kaa sabase bada oparation shuru ho chukaa tha
 There was now only nine hours left for the parade to begin

 darasal suraksha agenciyon ke paas pukhta khabar thi ki aatankwaadi farji ai-card or suraksha karmchaariyon kii vardi me rajpath main ghus sakate hai
 As soon as this news was received, the American Secret Service also raised its ears
 fouran bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ke saath mil kar rajpath kii suraksha ke liye nai planning bani
 All the routes leading to Rajpath were divided into 13 parts
 in 13 ke 13 raston kii entry point par nigaraanee kii jimmedaari disipi level ke afasar kar rahe the
 Now through these 13 points, along with the common people, the security staff also had to go inside the Rajpath

 Before that security personnel had to be sent in so that they could take their respective positions

 suraksha agenciyon kii salaah par pehle hi ye bataa diya gaya tha ki aam log parade shuru hone se teen ghante pehle hi apni-apni seat par baith jaaen
 The effect of this was that before the light of dawn, people started reaching Rajpath in the darkness of dawn

 Usually, the chief guest arrives at the Rajpath with the President in his coach or car
 magar pehali baar tha jab raashtrapati akele aae
 And the chief guest is different
 darasal isaki vajah vahi suraksha thi
 The staff of the American Secret Service does not allow their President to sit in any other car
 darasal america raashtrapati jab jameen par hote hai to sirf apni car da bist main hi baithte hai
 Because the Beast can be destroyed by a bomb, it has no effect on the firing and even it is safe from chemical attack
 obama idhar parade kaa lutf le rahe the or udhar hindustan or america kii tamaam khufia or suraksha agenciyaan ab puri tarah se harakat main thim
 From the land of Rajpath to the sky above Rajpath, everyone's eyes were on him
 satellite or radar kii madad se aasmaan khangale ja rahe the to drone kii madad se aasmaan se jameen naapi ja rahi thi
 Hundreds of soldiers were eyeing every frame of the CCTV camera in a specially built control room away from Rajpath
 rajpath par har 180 meter ke faasale par ek sisitivi camera laga tha
 a total of 25 tableaux passed in front of Barack Obama on Rajpath during 112 minutes
 in tamaam jhaankiyon main shaamil logon ko bhi usee talaashi or pahchaan kii kavayad se guzarana padaa jisase khud suraksha karmchaaree gujarey the
 And finally, as soon as the 66th Republic Day celebrations end after 112 minutes and Obama leaves the Rajpath in the same Beast Car, then the last ten days are the biggest security campaign in the history of independent India

 Sania Mirza said that the tussle over the selection of the tennis team for the London Olympics led to discord among the players and her relationship with Mahesh Bhupathi also deteriorated but she is now forgetting to focus on winning medals in mixed doubles with Leander Paes is
 bhupati or rohan bopanna ne pes ke saath jodi banane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Paes was then forced to pair up with low-ranked player Vishnu Vardhan
 vah samjhaute ke tahat mishrit yugal main sania ke saath jodi banaaenge
 Sania said, 'no one was benefited by this dispute
 isse hamaare bich manmutav paidaa hua or yah durbhagyapurna he
 i am glad that it is over and i can now focus on doing well in the Olympics and winning medals together with Leander
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamen ab ise bhulaakar padak jeetne par dhyaan lagaana chahie
 Leander reached the final of Wimbledon and it is a positive thing
 main or mahesh haar gayi or yah durbhagyapurna he
 We should have played in the finals
 ’sania ne kaha ki chayan vivaad ke kaaran unke bhupati ke saath rishte bhi kharaab hue hai
 He said, 'it was not easy to get that controversy out of my mind and it was bothering me
 maine jo kuch kaha tha usase aisi sthiti nahin bani thim mahesh or main bahut achche mitra he lekin vivaad se hamaari dosti main bhi daraar padi he
 Sania said that she would have liked to pair with Bhupathi in mixed doubles but they can win medals together with Paes
 sania ne se kaha, ‘main forehand khilaadi hum or mahesh bacand khilaadi he isaliye main apni pasand bataa rahi thi
 But i never said whether i would play with a player or not
 main apane desh ke liye kisi ke saath bhi khilne ko taiyaar hum
 He said, 'leander is a very good player and my friend too
 main lambey samay tak unke saath khel chuki hum
 It is an honor for me to play with him in the Olympics
 main acchhee form main hum, maine bhupati ke saath french open khitaab jeeta
 Paes also reached the final of Wimbledon so he is also in good form
 hamaare paas padak jeetne kaa acha mauka he
 Sania has won medals in Commonwealth and Asian and Afro Asian Games and said that now she wants to put Olympic medal in her bag
 unhone kaha, ‘mere paas rashtramandal, asian khelon or effro asian khelon samet 12 padak hai
 Only winning the Olympic medal remains
 isaliye is baar mujhe padak jeetne kii ummid he
 When asked if she would practice with Paes before the Olympics, Sania said, "I have not met Leander and i have not spoken
" vah wimbledon final main the lekin unase mil nahin saki
 Captain SP Mishra contacted everyone and said that he wants everyone in London by 23 July, so i will reach there then
 ’sania ne kaha, ‘main america ja rahi hum or san diego main kheloongi
 From there i will go to London and after 23 July i think i will start practicing with Leander
 ’vah is vichaar se bilkul bhi sahamat nahin thi ki mishrit yugal main padak jeetna anya kii tulana main aasaan hoga kyonki isamen 16 team kaa dra he 
 Sania said, 'I think it is wrong that the mixed doubles competition will be easy
 log kah rahe hai ki agar aap do match jeet jaaoge to aap semifinal main pahunch jaaoge or aap padak jeet loge
 But the draw is quite difficult
 duniya kii sarvshereshth mishrit timen dra main shaamil hai isaliye match jeetna aasaan nahin hoga

 What to eat in uric acid? These 4 foods will reduce uric acid Diabetes Diet: Eating these 5 foods in diabetes can be dangerous, will affect the blood sugar level! treatment loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye dilli kii saaton siton par sattarudh aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne apane sipahasaalar utaar die hai
 All the seven candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party are trying to win over the Congress and BJP in a political battle to demand full statehood of Delhi, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal fielded more than one veteran from Delhi
 aaj un saat ummidavaaron main se chaar diggaj aam aadmi party ko alavida kah chuke hai
 While the remaining three leaders are in the party, they are seen to be marginalized
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ne patrkaar se netaa bane ashutosh ko chandani chowk, jeenyu ke professor anand kumaar ko uttar purvi dilli, rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ke pote rajmohan gandhi ko purvi dilli, patrkaar se netaa bane ashish khetaan ko nai dilli, uttar pashchimi seat se raakhi birla, pashchimi dilli seat par patrkaar se netaa bane janrail singh or dakshini dilli seat se karnal davendra saharaavat ko pratyaashee banaaya tha
 Not a single one of these seven candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party could win
 sabase pehle rajmohan gandhi gaedilachasp baat ye he ki kejariwal ne jin saaton ummidavaaron ko 2014 main dilli jeetne ke liye ran main utaara tha
 Four of them have broken ties with veteran Kejriwal
 sabase pehle purvi dilli seat se chunavi maidan main utarane vaale rajmohan gandhi the, jinhone kejariwal kaa saath choda tha
 Rajmohan Gandhi went back to America only after the defeat and did not appear in any of the party's programs later
 uttari purvi dilli se chunavi maidan main kismat aajamaane vaale professor anand kumaar ne yogedra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke saath hi party ko alavida kah diya tha
 After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in the 2015 assembly elections, Professor Anand Kumar parted ways with Kejriwal after he fought for supremacy in the party
 dilli main rajyasabha chunaav ke baad agast 2018 main patrkaar se netaa bane ashutosh ne arvind kejariwal kaa saath chhod diya tha
 At one time Ashutosh was counted among the leaders close to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 ashutosh ne party chhodane ke peeche nijee kaaran kaa hawala diya tha, lekin baad main yah saaf ho gaya ki unhone rajyasabha main bheje gaye logon se naaraaz hokar party chodi thi
 After this, the Chief Minister refused to accept Ashutosh's resignation and tried to obey him, but he did not reverse his decision
 sakriy raajnneeti se alag hue ashish khetanashutosh ke istife ke kareeb ek hafte baad hi lagbhag unke saath hi party main shaamil hone vaale purv patrkaar ashish khetaan ne bhi sakriy raajnneeti se naata todakar alag ho gaye the
 At the time of resigning, Ashish Khaitan, a candidate from the New Delhi seat, had said, 'for the moment i am completely focused on legal practice and am not involved in active politics
 '3 netasid linein chaaron netaaon ke naata todane ke baad raakhi birla, janrail singh or karnal davendra saharaavat netaa bache hai
 These three leaders are currently in the party, but have been completely side-lined
 kejariwal ne loksabhaa chunaav ke baad 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pratyaashee banaaya tha, jisamen teenon jitkar aae the
 But the interesting thing is that Rakhi Birla, who was a minister in Kejriwal's first government, did not make a minister again

 In this case, the court sentenced Narayan Sai to life imprisonment

 Apart from this, four companions of Narayan Sai have also been sentenced to 10-10 years
 bataa den ki surat seshans court ne yah sajaa sunai he or narayan sai is faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt main apil kar saktaa he
 Sai (47) has been lodged in Lajpore Jail since 2013

 Schools in 40 cities, more than 400 ashrams, such is Asaram's empire
 In 2016, the Income Tax Department investigation revealed that Asaram's undisclosed assets worth more than Rs 2300 crore

 Death sentence is not banned in India

 In this politics too, touch of religion comes

 While hanging Afzal Guru, the Supreme Court has said a place in its judgment that hanging is necessary to satisfy the collective consciousness of the society
 ab hamen yaa aapako sochna chahie ki ye samuhik chetana kaise banati he
 If there is a collective consciousness about Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon then how does it diverge about the killers of Rajoana Bhullar or Rajiv Gandhi
 jo bhi he aisi tathakthith samuhik chetana hakeekat to he hi
 Remember, even during the Nirbhaya incident, a certain kind of fierce collective consciousness was daring to hang the killers of Nirbhaya
 baavjood uske balaatkaar kii sazaa ko sakht banane ke liye jute divangat justise verma ne apni report main faansee kii sazaa shaamil karne se inkaar kar diya us vakt raisina or puure desh kii samuhik chetana saream faansee dene kii bhi baat karti thi
 a few years later, in Delhi itself, a girl named Meenakshi is publicly killed with knives
 samuhik chetana nadaarad ho jaati he
 Justice Verma was right
 samuhik chetana ke bharose kanoon nahin chal saktaa
 i give another example of how collective consciousness can be formed
 hamaare aaj ke mehmaan or mashhoor vakil ujjwal nikam ne jaipur main kaha ki kasaab ke paksh main ban rahi hawa kaa rukh badalane ke liye unhone jhooth bolaa ki kasaab ne matan biryani kii maang kii
 This statement left the collective consciousness silent but many people were shocked
 pitiai ke anusaar nikam ne yah bhi bataaya ki biryani kii baat bataate hi media main panel discshan hone lage
 Kasab was a terrorist and even hanged, but when this false fact became part of the election sloganeering, then people of special religion in the name of Biryani started being targeted that a government was feeding Biryani to the terrorist in the wake of their vote
 isse hota yah he ki jo log faansee kii sazaa kaa hi virodh karte hai wo akele pad jate hai
 At the time of Afzal Guru's execution, when those who were being hanged were being called traitors, the prominent political thinker Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote in the Indian Express that there were disagreements with the court's decision
 (*change) aise sawaal karnaa deshadroh nahin he balki loktantr majboot hi hota he
 (* change) Pratap Bhanu Mehta says that the Indian state has shown its weakness

 Because of which it has become really difficult to talk about the protest against the death penalty
 aisa lagata he ki kisi aatankwaadi ko mazahab ke naam par bachaaya ja rahaa he jabaki sawaal he ek bade cese ke zariye faansee kaa virodh
 Those opposing the execution have also opposed the hanging of Rajoana and Bhullar
 This is the talk of Yakub Memon whose death sentence is being commuted to life imprisonment

 i used to tell Yakub that i miss Mahim's fishermen
 maine yah prasang isliye nahin bataaya ki aapako yaqub se sahanubhuti ho
 Journalists who cover the blast case every day also say that Yakub believed that Tiger Memon was the only culprit in this blast

 In response, Tiger Memon said, "don't be Gandhi, don't surrender

 It is said that there was some deal between the intelligence agency and Yakub Memon, which Yakub did well
 kya deal hui kabhi ricard par nahin aa saki isliye usase mukademe main koi madad nahin mil saki
 Nor did Jacob ever tell
 lekin yah sahi he ki yaqub ne khud ko kanoon ke hawaale kiya balki apane parivaar ke anya saat sadasyon ko bhi bharat le aayaa
 Jacob felt that he would be softened in return

 Raman was the head of Raw's Pakistan desk at the time

 He was hurt that his officers lied in Mumbai court

 Raman refused to make his point public because he did not want others to survive
 unka kahana tha ki yaqub kaa pakistan se bharat le aana bhartiya khufia agency kii aitihaasik kamyaabi he
 But there is politics about its punishment
 is raajnneeti main bhi mazahab kaa tach aa jaataa he
 For example, on 30 August 2011, when the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against the hanging of Rajiv Gandhi's killer, (* change) no one called Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi a traitor
 (*change) Akali Dal leaders openly oppose the hanging of Rajoana and Bhullar, (* Change) Akali Dal partner BJP supports the hanging but does not call Akali Dal a traitor
 afzal guru ko faansee dete vakt supreme court ne apane faisle main ek jagah kaha he ki samaaj kii samuhik chetana ko santusht karne ke liye faansee zaruri he
 Now we or you should think how this collective consciousness is formed
 agar afzal guru or yaqub memon ke bare main samuhik chetana he to wo rajoana bhullar yaa rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ke bare main alag kaise ho jaati he
 Whatever is the so-called collective consciousness is a reality
 aap yaad kiijie nirbhaya cond ke vakt bhi ek khaas kism kii ugr samuhik chetana nirbhaya ke hatyaron ko faansee ke liye lalkaar rahi thi
 Despite the fact that the late Justice Verma, who was trying to make his rape sentence tougher, refused to include the death penalty in his report, at that time, the collective consciousness of Raisina and the whole country also talked about hanging himself publicly
 uske kuch hi saal baad dilli main hi minakshi naam kii ek ladki ko saream chaakuon se god kar maar diya jaataa he
 The collective consciousness disappears

 According to PTI, Nikam also told that the panel discussion started in the media as soon as Biryani was told
 kasaab to aatankwaadi hi rahaa or faansee bhi hui lekin jab yah jhootha tathy chunavi narebaazi kaa hissaa bana to biryani ke naam se khaas mazahab ke logon ko nishaanaa banaaya jane laga ki ek sarkaar unke vot ke chakkar main aatankwaadi ko biryani khilaa rahi he
 It happens that those who oppose the execution of the sentence fall alone

 His question is whether the case of Jacob is the rarest of the rare
 tiger memon or uskaa parivaar dhamaake se do din pehle pakistan bhaag gaya tha
 Tiger and Dawood, the main accused in the Mumbai serial blasts, are still absconding but after a few days of detention in Karachi, Yakub Memon decides to come to India
 shila bhatta ne likhaa he ki uski patni rahin ne kaha tha ki ham isliye aae kyonki ham karachi main nazarband the
 We did not like it
 ham apana vatan yaad aa rahaa tha
 (* change) We did not want to live in shame
 main yaqub ko kahati thi ki mujhe mahim ke machuaarine yaad aati hai
 i did not mention this incident because you have sympathy with Yakub
 dhamaake ke cese ko har din cover karne vaale patrkaar bhi kehete hai ki yaqub kaa maananaa tha ki is dhamaake main tiger memon hi kasuurvaar he
 Yakub, an intern in Pakistan, told Tiger Memon that i am going to Gandhi's country
 jawaab main tiger memon ne tha ki gandhi mat bano, aatmasamarpan mat karo
 Now all these things have not been confirmed concretely
 kaha yah jaataa he ki khufia agency or yaqub memon ke bich kuch deal hui jise yaqub ne bakhubi nibhaayaa
 Could the deal never come on record, so it could not help in the case
 na hi kabhi yaqub ne bataaya
 But it is true that Jacob handed himself to the law but also brought seven other members of his family to India
 yaqub ko laga ki badale main uske saath narmi barti jaaegi
 There is also a story that Yakub's lawyer at Kathmandu Airport prevented him from surrendering
 radiff kii shila bhatta ne jab vakil se pushti ke liye phone kiya to phone kaat diya
 Did not get an answer
 tippaniyan Senior Mumbai Police officer Rakesh Maria's investigation into the Mumbai bombings is no less than a saga for journalists covering the case

 The case of Yakub's execution is currently at the point that preparations are being made for hanging on 30 July, twice the Supreme Court has rejected Yakub's petition, the President has done it and another time on Monday, the three judges of the Supreme Court Will hear on this

 During the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Bihar government why there is a ban on trials in Kishabuddinamale
 In response to which the Bihar government had told that Shahabuddin has been transferred from Siwan to Bhagalpur jail, due to which there were problems in the trial
 chanda babu ne apni yachika main kaha he ki shahabuddin ke jail se baahar nikalne par siwan main ek baar phiradahshatka maahaul he
 At the same time, Prashant Bhushan has strongly opposed Shahabuddin's bail
 unhone kaha ki do maamalon main shahabuddin ko umrakaid kii sajaa or duusare anya maamalon main 30 saal kii sajaa hui he

 According to the victim, she left her home at around 8
30 pm last night and was going to her husband's shop
 tabhi raste main use uske devar shamshuddin or uski patni naazamin samet javed or sona ne shabnam ko roak liya
 They all started fighting with Shabnam

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has accused the central government of taking help from Maoists
 bakaul modi jo log naksaliyon ke saath jude hai, unhen kabhi planning kamishan, to kabhi rashtriya salaahkaar parishad main bhartee kiya ja rahaa he
 Modi also disguised the Center's wavering attitude on the issue of internal security
 ye sab baaten unhone aatanrik suraksha ke masale par mukhyamantriyon ke sammelan ke baad patrakaron se baat karte hue kahin
 Here you can read Narendra Modi's complete statement, as it is
 
 
 congress kaa to ab bahut bura haal he
 Gujarat has two Lok Sabha seats, on which the BJP won a grand victory, a message to the Congress for the 2014 elections
 janata kii naaraazgi kaa sandesh, jo dilli kii sarkaar ke liye ultimatum he, main bhavy vijay ke liye gujarat kaa dhanyavad karata hum
 Today there was a meeting regarding internal security in Delhi
 maine pehle bhi kaha ki ye upie sarkaar kii shaayad aakhri meeting ho
 i said in the meeting that such a meeting was also held earlier under the leadership of PM Manmohan Singh
 das saal main bharat sarkaar ne kya kiya, meeting hui, siem aae, unhone suzav die, un par centre sarkaar ne kya ection liya, is bare main desh ke saamne ek white paper pesh kiya janaa chahie
 This meeting has become a ritual, the CM suggests, the PM listens, but what action was taken on them, this country wants to know
 aakhir isamen sabaki itani shakti or samarth lag rahaa he
 And so i have made this demand from the PM
 maine yah bhi kaha ki is internal sicurity kii meeting se majboot massej janaa chahie
 The whole country is with Chhattisgarh, with Raman Singh
 desh maowad ke aatank ko na to sweekaar karegaa, na uski sharan main jayega
 The country will fight, fight with full force
 pashupati se tirupati tak puraa red coridor maovadiyon ne raktranjit kar diya he
 i have requested the PM in the meeting that there should be a two-pronged strategy to deal with Maoism
 do tarah ke ilaake hai, pehle, jo naksal prabhavit aria hai, duusare jahaan par maowad kii nazren tiki hui hai
 In 2012, the PM responded in Parliament, with six big cities and part of Mumbai to Ahmedabad targeting them
 ab maovadi gramin ke bajaay shahari base taiyaar karne main jute hai
 Tonight, PM is meeting separately for Naxalite affected states
 lekin jahaan naksalwad failane kii sambhaavna he uske liye bhi alag meeting kerani chahie
 One should think that where there is, we can stop it and where it can spread, there is work also
 ensitisi ke sandarbh main grih mantri bhi apane pravachan main bole nahin hai, piem bhi bole nahin hai, lekin agenda main he
 i said that you have not spoken, so it seems that what is your mind, yet i want to say with full urge that you cannot solve the problem by creating a new agency
 ek nai agency banaakar aap wel ystablishd agency kaa manobal kam karte hai
 For example, the Planning Commission has been working for the last fifty years under the leadership of PM
 is baar aapane achaanak enesi bana di, to planning kamishan bekaar ho gaya, uskaa koi role hi nahin rahaa
 a similar situation would be due to NCT, which should not be
 ibi ke andar ek acha kaam chal rahaa tha, wo tha emesi kaa, mike kaa
 In a way, if he had just established his roots, suddenly you are giving him from IB to NCT
 matlab ye hua ki ye mike naam kaa baccha, jo pairon par khadaa ho rahaa tha, use anaath kar diya
 There is no thinking, work is being done as usual
 maine aaj ek gambhir aarope lagaaya, maine kaha ki aapaki baaten rashtriya suraksha kii hoti hai, lekin aapke aikshasso rajkeey suraksha ke liye hote hai
 The country is interested in national security, your interest is in the security of Raj
 isile aap sari agency nijee rajnatik istemaal main laa rahe hai, or iske chalate in sari sansthaaon ko barbaad kar rahe hai
 The central government has undertaken the modernization of police forces
 usamen main dekh rahaa hum ki saal 2002 main jo bajet tha, aaj 2013 main bhi vahi bajet he, koi badhotaree nahin
 Earlier, the Government of India used to give 100 percent of the funds, then they put 25 percent burden on the state
 pichhali baar maine suzav diya ki ise kam kariye, to rajya kaa hissaa badhaakar 40 fisadi kar diya
 This is increasing the burden on the state, not increasing the budget, but simply increasing the paperwork
 bharat sarkaar ko panchayat par bharosa he, magar rajya sarkaar par nahin he
 Be it the state government of the UPA parties or the NDA parties
 aap panchayat ko sidhaa-sidhaa paisa dete hai, usamen koi dikkat nahin
 But in the name of modernization, allotted money is not given to the state, commentary goes on for two years
 kya tender he, koun vendor he, poochhate rahete hai, are aap ek guide line banaakar tay kar do, prototip vyavastha banaao
 Then check whether it is happening or not
 maine meeting main kaha ki chhattisgarh main jo maare gaye, unke liye shraddha he, police ke jawan maare jate hai, sena ke jawan maare jate hai, unke liye shraddha he
 The soldiers are beheaded, there is reverence for those soldiers
 kerala ke do machuaaron ko maar diya gaya, unke liye shraddha he
 i clearly said that today the whole house is with Chhattisgarh, Dr
 raman singh ke saath khadaa ho janaa chahie
 In Andhra, the Maoists kidnapped a district collector a few years ago
 unhen chhodane ke liye saat maovadiyon ko reeha karne kii maang kii gai
 There was a Maoist chairperson of an NGO named Padma
 vah bhi jail main thi
 They were demanded to leave
 ye padma koun hai
 The members of the NAC who run an NGO are the chairpersons of that NGO
 unka pati janaa mana maovadi aatankwaadi he
 So an activist whom the Maoists are demanding to leave should be in the NAC and nothing should be done against the NGO
 isliye main kahata hum ki aap rashtriya suraksha kii baat karte hai magar acshan rajkeey suraksha ke liye lete hai
 The policemen of Chhattisgarh, on whom the case was filed, may be debated on what happened in the court, as soon as it is acquitted you made him a member of the Planning Commission, the chairman of which is the Prime Minister
 aisa karke aapane state ke saare force kaa manobal khatm kar diya
 Secondly i said that NCTC or whatever you are doing, you are weakening the federal structure
 sab rajya milakar bharat sarkaar ke saath desh chalaate hai, ye big brother kaa atitude thik nahin he
 The Home Minister said in his speech that Mizoram and Tripura should settle their quarrel
 are bhai, phir aap kisalie hai, bharat sarkaar kya karegi
 The Sarkaria Commission had said that the Central Government should formulate a concrete mechanism to settle the conflict between the two states
 maine sarkaar se maang kii he ki sarkaria kamishan kii report par mukhyamantriyon ko bulaakar charchaa karai jaae
 As the Aam Aadmi Party imposed conditions to form the government, the Delhi unit of Congress today criticized the party led by Arvind Kejriwal, saying it was trying to abdicate responsibility and challenged it to honor the mandate
 congress ke vidhayak or purv bijli mantri haaron usuf ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'congress ne samarthan isliye diya taaki aap sarkaar bana sake kyonki unhen dilli kii janata se janadesh mila tha
 AAP sent a long list just to avoid responsibility
 ' The Congress, which ruled Delhi for fifteen years, could get only eight seats in the recent assembly elections
 party ne daawa kiya ki kejariwal ne congress or bhaajapa ke adhyakshon ko apane patr main jo 18 mudde uthaae hai unka vidhayika se kuch lenaa dena nahin he or yah is kshetra main 'unki jaankaree kii kami' darshata he
 Yusuf said, "talking about making promises and sharing free gifts is a different thing and in fact different things to do, if things start happening this way, then one day he can send a letter to the President of the US and the head of the United Nations
 ' In a surprising development, the Congress last night spoke of the unconditional support of eight of its mlas to clear the way for the formation of the next government in Delhi
 haalanki aap ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ke saath aaj apni mulaakaat ke dauraan samay maanga or kaha ki unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or bhaajapa pramukh rajnath singh ko patr likhakar 18 muddon par unki raay maangi he
 The former minister said, 'he misguided the people of Delhi and secured votes
 main un yuvaaon, jinhone yah sochakar aap ko vot diya ki vah badlaav laaegi, se kahana chahta hum ki ab unhen yah maang kerani chahie ki party sarkaar banaae or apane vaade puure kare
 ' dilli police ne do aise yuvakon ko giraftaar kiya he, jinhone online shopping ko hi thagi kaa shikaar bana diya tha
 In fact, the accused have carried out many fraud cases under the pretext of online shopping
 police aropiyon se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Robin and Mohit are the names of the accused in the police custody
 donon aropiyon ne online shopping maamle main abhi tak 6 vaardaaton ko anjaam dene kii baat kubul kii he
 According to the police, both the accused had maintained their account on the Amazon online shopping website
 donon ne acount banaae jane ke dauraan maangi jane vaali har jaankaree galat di hui thi
 According to the police, both the accused used to get expensive items from their Nakali account
 jab delivery boy saamaan lekar inke farji pate par pahunchataa tha, tab donon shaatir apradhi delivery boy ko baton main uljhaakar saamaan badal diya karte the
 Police inquiries have revealed that both used to pack stones and soap in the box instead of the original goods
 philhal donon aaropee ab police kii giraft main hai
 Police are trying to find out from the accused in interrogation that till now they have committed fraud and how many incidents have been committed
 gauratlab he ki tyoharon ke is maheene menonline shoppingbazar main hode machi hui he
 Shopping websites are offering all kinds of offers to their customers everyday
 aise main online shopping kar rahe logon ko bhi shopping karte vakt kaaphi satark rahane kii jarurat he

" rajan ne bataaya ki chauthi timahi main akele swasthya seva kshetra main hi 60,000 naukariyaan paidaa hongi
 Real estate and it-ites are expected to create 50-50 thousand jobs in each sector

 In Maharashtra, with the support of the bjp-shiv Sena's broken 30-year-old friendship congress-ncp, Shiv Sena will form a government, both have broken up due to the pull of the Chief Minister's post between Shiv Sena and BJP in Maharashtra
 is tarah se donon kaa 30 saal purana gathbandhan tut gaya he
 After the bjp's refusal to form the government, the Shiv Sena is busy fixing its political equation
 mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 In such a situation, even though the paths of power in Maharashtra seem to be closed for the BJP
 lekin kahawat he ki jab ek rasta band hota he to kai raahen khulti bhi hai
 For the BJP, the results are currently looking negative, but in a broader perspective, the current developments could be a profitable deal for him in the future
 shivasena ne dhundha congress or ensipi kaa sathmaharashtra main pandrah din pehle vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae to bijepi or shivasena ko spasht bahumat mila tha
 But, due to the sticking of Shiv Sena to the post of Chief Minister, the BJP has pushed back the move to form a government in Maharashtra and gave Shiv Sena a chance to form a government
 aise main shivasena apane dhuravirohi congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane main juty he
 This makes the BJP feel that the Shiv Sena's journey with the congress-ncp will not last very long, because on the ideological level, they have been very opposed to each other
 bijepi kii najar he maharashtra parbata den ki centre main narendra modi ke satta main aane ke baadabijapi kaa desh main graph badhaahai
 BJP has succeeded in forming a government on its own in many states from north to south and northeast to west of India
 uttar pradesh ke baad maharashtra desh kaa doosraa sabase bada rajya he, jis par bijepi kii najar he
 Prior to 2014, the Shiv Sena was in Maharashtra as the elder brother and the BJP as the younger brother
 2014 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main centre main saath main hote hue bijepi-shivasena ne alag-alag kismat aajamaai thi
 Both BJP and Shiv Sena realized their political power
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki devendra fadanvis ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar main shivasena ko junior partner hone kii haisiyat ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In 2014, the BJP managed to win 120 seats on its own
 shivasena kaa jalawaa padaa kamzormaharashtra main shivasenougr hindutv, musalmaan virodh or pakistanper hamalavar vichaardhaara ko lekar chali thi, bijepi usase zyada ugr tevar apanaakar or narendra modi or amit shah jaise netaaon ko aage karke shivasena ke saamne badi lakeer khinch chuki he
 Shiv Sena's incineration in Maharashtra in Balasaheb Thackeray's days is over
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 2019 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan main bijepi ko 164 or shivasena ko 124 siton par kismat aajamaani padi
 BJP put the ball in Shiv Sena's court, the BJP had to leave the Shiv Sena behind one day to come to power in Maharashtra
 aise main shivasena siem kii kursi ke liye khud hi bijepi kaa saath chhodkar congress or ensipi ke saath haath milane ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the desire of the BJP seems to be fulfilling, because its alliance with Shiv Sena was going on since 1989
 aise main bijepi ne yah mahayuti khud na todakar gend shivasena ke paale main daal di thi
 The Shiv Sena will also have to compromise its militant Hindutva politics and anti-muslim politics after going with the BJP-NCP, which became the lone party of militant Hindutva in Maharashtra
 aise main yah faisla ho gaya ki maharashtra main ugr hindutv kii pratinidhi party ab shivasena nahin balki bijepi rahegi
 The Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya has come in favor of Ram Mandir and the Modi government has taken a big step by removing Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, which gives it hope to increase its political base and come to power on its own
 ab bijepi ke liye maharashtra he khulaa maidanisi ke saath bijepi ke liye ab maharashtra main maidan puri tarah se khulaa he or bhavishya main hone vaale siyaasi sangram main bijepi banaam ol party ke bich chunavi sangram hoga
 In such a situation, the BJP hopes that it can improve its result significantly by pushing the electoral table for 288 seats alone under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 jabaki, shivasena bhale hi abhi congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana len, lekin bhavishya ke siyaasi ranbhumi main uske liye mushkilen khadi hongi
 Now it has to be seen who gets the benefit and loss of this Nurukushti? jahaan ek taraf desh ke kuch hisse aise hai jahaan log abhi bhi barish kaa intjaar kar rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf mumbai kii barish main aam logon kaa haal behaal kar he
 Mumbai is currently upset due to heavy rains

 a post shared by александр (@sandysman12345) on Mar 18, 2019 at 6:22am PDT CBFC Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani's name is again in the news after he was labeled as 'unconvincing' on lipstick under my burqa
 alankruta shrivastav ke nirdesan main bani is film ko prakaash jha ne produs kiya he
 The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) refused to give a certificate to Prakash Jha's new film Lipstick Under My Burka
 CBFC ne film produsar prakaash jha ko ek chitthee bhejkar kaaran saaf kiya he ki kyon film ko pramanit nahin kiya gaya he
 Censor board said 'lipstick under my burka' was 'unconvincing', did not give certificate in exclusive discussion on this dispute till date
 lekin film main mahilaon ko sahi tareeke se nahin darshaya gaya he isliye yah 'e' certificate ke saath paas nahin ho sakati he
 On the matter of not running scissors on the film, Pahlaj said - If we had done this, the producers could go to court
 isliye aisa na karnaa hi hamane behatar samajha
 Some films were then passed by the censor board
 'jolly elelbi 2' iskaa haalia udhaaharan he
 The unsuspecting 'lipstick under my burqa' has won several awards
 On the advice of Shyam Benegal, Pahlaj said that it has not been passed and if there is some confusion that they should question the government instead of the censor board
 CBFC ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani ne kaha he ki unhone apana kaam kiya he or ab film ke nirmaataa upree sanstha yaa court kahin bhi ja sakate hai
 On questioning the kissing scene of 'befikre', Pahlaj said that all of that was in one realm and the Revising Committee had passed it
 phir yah ek tarah kaa prayog bhi tha lihaaja donon filmon kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Lipstick Under My Burkha is a slap on the current controversy of triple talaq, but the film is made by a woman when it was asked to Nihalani that 'lipstick Under My Burka' has been made by a female director
 is par CBFC kaa kahana tha ki vah jo chaahe banaaen lekin kya dikhaaya jayega or kya nahin, iskaa faisla to board hi karegaa
 At the same time, on the question of being censored by the censor board, Pahlaj has said that the sanskar is the tradition of our country and the task of saving the sanskar is with the censor board

 In simple terms, according to the provisions of ESMA Act, anyone, be it a student or a teacher
 yadi vah esma adhinium dhara (VIII) kaa ulanghan karte hai to unhen rajya police kisi bhi warrant ke bina giraftaar kar sakati hai
 Dr
 Aditya Narayan Mishra, former president of Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA), said that on the orders of the University Grant Commission (UGC), efforts are being made to change the DUK Act
 unhone kaha yadi esma adhinium niyam lagu hota he to puri tarah se dilli vishvavidhyalayon kly adhinium badal jayega
 He described the ESMA Act as "fatal"
 diu ke ek professor ke anusaar, dilli vishvavidhyalay kii kaaryakari parishad (EC) se saath charchaa kiye bina mantralay ne is kadam ko uthaa liya he
 As per MHRD order - Chairman and six members of UGC, VC of BHU, DU, Bhopal Law University, TISS Mumbai, Tezpur University and former registrar of BHU will have the power to decide how decisions related to teaching, learning, examination and evaluation Will be taken samiti ko 30 dinon ke andar yani 3 november ko mantralay ko report saunpny hogi
 At the same time, teachers and students are opposing this decision, because they say that the government wants to bring the teaching work of teachers and examinations etc
 under the ambit of ESMA law in universities and thus tried to take away the rights and freedom of teachers

 Whereas it has been seen that whenever Rahul leaves immediately after the incident, there has been a question that administrative chaos spreads with his arrival

 All the party is worried that this decision of the court should not upset the Dalit vote bank, because the election of Karnataka is absolutely over the head and the excitement of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections has already started
 yahi vajah he ki ek baad ek party is maamle main supreme court ke faisle ko palatwane ke liye kuch na kuch karte dikhnaa chaahati he
 The allies involved in the BJP and the NDA feel that due to being in the government, the fact that they can not save the edge of this Act from being weakened

 pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat ke baad paswan ne kaha ki piem ne unki baton ko gambhirtha se suna or punarvichaar yachika daakhil karne ke bare main unka ruukh sakaaratmak tha
 Paswan is a Dalit politician, so he is going a step ahead in this matter
 unki party lokjanshkti party is maamle main pehle hisupreme courtka darwaja khatkhata chuki he or is maamme main party nahin hone ke baavjood apni taraf se punarvichaar yachika daakhil kar chuki he
 Like Paswan, Union Minister and Republican Party President Ramdas Athawale is also taking action on his behalf
 unhone bhi pichley hi hafte pradhanmantri ko chithti likh bheji or kaha ki sarkaar ko jald se jald supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhata kar is faisle ko badwane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Another Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Loksamata Party also did not want to be left behind in this matter, so he too sent a letter to the Prime Minister on Mangwar and released it to the media

 By tweeting about this, Rahul Gandhi said that this decision of the Supreme Court has come at a time when incidents of atrocities against Dalits and Adivasis are increasing across the country
 congress ye bhi aarope laga rahi he ki court main jo hua he uske liye modi sarkaar hi doshi he, kyonki wo court ke saamne thik se maamle kii pairvi nahin kar saki
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that if the government had properly handled the matter in court, then this decision would not have come, due to which there has been so much controversy
 yah tha faisla20 march ko supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki asi asti act kaa jamkar durupyog ho rahaa he isliye ab is maamle main sidhe giraftaar nahin hokar esaspi kii manjuuri ke baad hi giriftaar ho sakegi

 shoeb ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha he ki talaakname par bhale hi unhone dastakhat kar die lekin sach kya he ise upar vaala jaanata he
 That is, Shoaib is still unwilling to believe that he had married Aisha
 phir kyon jhuk gaye shoeb?lahore se baaraati aa chuke hai
 The wedding mehndi has also been decorated in the hands of bride Sania Mirza
 nikaah main bas haftebhar kaa vakt hai, lekin duulhe raja kahin tanha khoe hue hai
 If someone has been troubled by the marriage of Ayesha Siddiqui, then it is only Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik who is Sania's husband
 beshak, birdari ke bujurgon kii salaah or halaat kii gambhirtha ko bhaanpate hue buudhvaar ko shoeb talaakname par dastakhat karne ko raji ho gaye, lekin ab bhi wo dil se is sach ko kabool nahin kar paa rahe
 In a statement released in the media, Shoaib said that i am not the one to decide what is right, what is wrong because what is true is the above
 sauhardpurn tareeke se jo sahi ho saktaa tha maine vahi kiya kyonki har din halaat tark se dur hote ja rahe the
 It is clear from Shoaib's statement that he did not sign the divorce agreement wholeheartedly
 is samjhaute main shaamil major kadiri ke bayaan se bhi isaki tasdik hui thi
 So the question arises how Shoaib Malik bowed down? Actually, it started on Monday only when the police stepped up the investigation in the case
 police jaanch ke dabaav main hi sania mirza ke parivaar ne apane kherakhwaahon ke jariye aaysha ke parivaar se baatcheet shuru kar di
 The next day, Captain Karim, a prominent Congress leader living in Hyderabad and close to the Mirza and Siddiqui families, jumped in to rescue the two families
 lekin dikkat ye thi ki koi bhi apane rukh se rattibar bhi peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Then a bouncer was thrown from the Siddiqui family
 darasal siddiki parivaar ne apane vakil ke jariye court main arji daakhil kar shoeb or sania kii shaadi rukvane kaa faisla kar liya tha
 In the presence of lawyers, Imran Mirza was also shown this draft application, which left the sweat of Shoaib and Sania's families in view
 nikaah kaa din kareeb tha
 The marriage arrangements were completed and even the cards were distributed
 aise main ain vakt par shaadi talwaane kii dhamkee siddiki parivaar ke liye kaam kar gai
 But see Windbna, according to Hyderabad police, under the terms of the divorce, the Siddiqui family has not withdrawn the case from Shoaib
 unka passport ab bhi court main he
 There is another screw in this case
 shoeb par 498-e ke tahat jo mukadmaa kiya gaya he, kanoon use peedit paksh bhi waapas nahin le saktaa
 So what will Shoaib do now? Will their problems be less? pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi) ke duusare kaarykaal ke liye chune jane ke baad imran khan (imran Khan)sarkaar kii taraf se mili naye shanti sandeshon ke bich america ne pakistan sarkaar se saaf kiya he ki aatankwaadi samoohon ko alag-thalag karke dakshin asia main satat shanti laane kii jimmedaari uski he
 Imran Khan said in another letter written after Prime Minister Modi was re-elected that Pakistan wants to talk with India to resolve all differences, including the Kashmir issue
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri (imran Khan) ne kaha ki donon deshon kii janata ko garibi se ubaarane ke liye donon ke bich vaarta hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he or kshetra ke vikaas ke liye milakar kaam karnaa mahatvapurn he
 However, India has rejected Pakistan's offer to negotiate, saying that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand and any bilateral meeting between the two Prime Ministers on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on 13-14 June in Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek
 Is not planned white house ke ek varisht adhikari ne is saptaah kaha ki america vastav main chahta he ki pakistan main giraftaaryaan hon or mukademe chalem va in samoohon ko aaazaad ghoomane, hathiyaar kharidne, bharat main pravesh karne or hamale karne nahin diye jaaen
 On the condition of anonymity, the official said that the United Nations wants to see such continuous steps that stop the activities of terrorists
 bharat-paak ke bich tanaav par america ke akalan se jude sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue white house ke adhikari ne kaha ki jab tak in samoohon ko alag-thalag nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak bharat or pakistan ke liye satat shanti hasil karnaa bahut kathin he
 Therefore, it is the responsibility of Pakistan to act on these groups
 videsh vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki pulavama aatanki hamale ke maddenjar america ne pakistan ko pratibandhit aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf kuch shuruuaati kadam uthaate dekha he
 The official said that we welcome these steps
 unhone kaha ki hamane hameshaa is baat par sahmati jataai he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav ke buniyadi kaarnon par dhyaan dena jaruri he
 This tension is due to terrorist forces who have refuge in the land of Pakistan
 isliye ham nishchit rup se ek aise maahaul ke nirmaan ko protsaahit karte hai jisamen samvaad hoga
 State governments are scared of central government policies regarding electric vehicles
 rajya sarkaron kaa kahana he ki electric gadiyon ke aane se petrol-dijal kii khapat ghategi or isse waite ke jariye aane vaale rajasav main kami aegi
 The central government has decided to convert 30 per cent of private cars, 70 per cent of commercial cars, 40 per cent of buses and 80 per cent of two-wheeler and three-wheelers into electric vehicles by 2030
 vahiin, rajya sarkaron ko chintaa he ki petroleum padaarth jiesti ke baahar hai
 With the advent of electric vehicles, the revenue from VAT will be reduced
 ye unke liye bada nuksaan hoga
 The state governments want that if the revenue of the electric vehicles of the central government reduces their revenue, then the central government should compensate it
 isse pehle centre sarkaar ne jiesti lagu karte vakt kaha tha ki rajya sarkaron kii jiesti rajasav main ai kami ko centre sarkaar paanch saal tak puraa karegi
 Now scared of the electric vehicles policy, the state governments are asking that the GST case be extended by another five years
 taaki, electric gadiyon kii niti se hone vaale nuksaan kii thodi-bahut bharpai ho sake
 Come
 
 
 aapako bataate hai ki electric gadiyon kii niti se kya phaayde or nuksaan hongeelectric gadiyon ke phaayde1
 Economical: After much research, now the price of electric vehicles has come down considerably
 is par lagane vaala jiesti 12 fisadi se kam hokar 5 fisadi ho gaya he

 They do not release any poisonous gas
 global varming main bharat kii hissedari kam ho jaaegi
 Air and noise pollution will be greatly reduced
 3
 Low Maintenance Cost: Maintenance cost of electric vehicles is very low as compared to conventional trains
 kyonki isamen ingine oil jaise liquid nahin hote
 Most parts do not need to be replaced
 kya bharat aisi gadiyon ke liye taiyaar he
 
 
 In response to the party, electric troms have been operating in Kolkata since 1945 in India
 hajaaron electric trainen chal rahi hai
 They are saving time and money
 niti ayog ke anusaar 2030 tak agar tay formule ke anusaar electric gaadiyaan chalane lageen to sadak par chalane vaali gadiyon main lagane vaali urja kaa 64 fisadi hissaa bachegaa
 Also, there will be a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions
 2030 tak electric gadiyon ke aane se desh main 153 megaton dijal or petrol kii bachat hogi
 About 3 from it
 9 lakh karod rupye kii bachat hogi
 These funds can be used to develop electric vehicle technologies
 duniya ke 20 sabase pradooshit shaharon main se 13 shahar to bharat main hi hai
 The introduction of electric vehicles will reduce air and noise pollution in these cities
 paris paryaavaran sandhi ke anusaar bharat ko 2030 tak jahrili gaison ke vaishvik utsarjan main apni hissedari kam kerani he
 That is why the central government has formulated a national e-mobility scheme
 kya bharat sach main taiyaar he
 
 
 In protest, most Indians prefer petrol-diesel vehicles
 kyonki electric gadiyon kaa pikup kamjor hota he
 The speed is also slow
 sabase bada kaaran he electric charging point or centres kii kami
 According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, 22 thousand electric vehicles were produced in India as of March 2016
 inamen se sirf 2000 chupahiyaa the
 Whereas, between 2011 and 2015, production of electric vehicles increased by 94% worldwide
 inamen sabase zyada china, america or europe main
 The Ola electric vehicle scheme started in Nagpur failed
 ola driver electric gaadiyaan lautaane lage the
 They moved back to traditional cars
 kyonki charging stesan par lambii line lagi rahati thim or laagat zyada aa rahi thi
 In 2016, a total of 30 lakh cars were sold in the country whereas electric cars sold only 22 thousand
 aise main inkaa bhavishya abhi dikh nahin rahaa he
 First of all, more and more electric charging stations will have to be built in the country, only then will there be ease in the country about electric vehicles

 jisamen lashkar aatankiyon ke handlers pakistan ke ishaare par hijbul aatankiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye AK-47 ke rutabe kaa ahsaas dilaate hai
 Also for this, the terrorists are given good dressing and getup, so that they can look like "robin Hood"
 aisa karne se kashmir ghati kii ladkiyaan unke is fiter luk se aakarshith hongi
 Intelligence reports have also revealed that Hizbul and Lashkar terrorists present in the valley also release their videos from time to time to succeed in this objective
 yahi kaaran he ki pichley kuch maheenon main 8 se 10 baar nae nae hathiyaaron ke saath fiter luk main nae nae video (robin hud geoup) jari ho chuke hai
 It plans to attract the girls of the valley by showing themselves with guns and fighter looks
 report ke khulaase se yah saaf zaahir hota he ki hijbul or lashkar aatankiyon ke bank lut or hathiyaar chhinane ke peeche bhi ISI kaa plan G-square hi kaam karata he
 That is, with money from bank robbery, you can buy expensive gifts, expensive mobiles and clothes for girlfriends and show your look like Robin Hood in a photo taken after snatching a -47
 aatankiyon ko robin hud jaisaa dikhaane kaa makasad ghati ke yuvaaon ko aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone ke liye aakarshan karne kaa ek tarika he

 In the interrogation, it was a surprise to the Danish that the Hizbul and Lashkar terrorists in Kashmir choose the path of terror to impress the girls and even more surprising is that many local girls would give such youth to the status of hero Because they present themselves like Robin Hood, doing so attracts many girls
 sutron ke mutabiq haal hi main suraksha balon se bachakar bhaage lashkar ke inami aatanki abu dujana kii 4 girl friend hai jisamen ek girl friend kii baatcheet ko suraksha agenciyon ne tres bhi kar kar liya jiske baad pakistan main baithe lashkar ke handler safullah sajid jatt urf nomi ne abu dujana ko fatima naam kii friend se baat karne or uskaa sim badalane kaa nirdesh diya

 Dhawan is playing for Delhi Capitals in the IPL, headed by former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, while former India captain Ganguly is his mentor
 bharat ke liye 128 vanade main 5355 ran bana chuke dhawan ne kaha, ‘main bahut khushkismat hum ki riki ponting or saurav ganguli ke saath kaam kar rahaa hum
 Both have been great captains
 mujhe unke anubhav se kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mil rahaa he
 'he said,' i am learning a lot from them, which is benefiting

 ’ At least 15 people were killed and more than 50 injured in a collision between two trains in Bangladesh's Brahmanbaria district on Tuesday

 At the same time, according to the news of 'daily Star', the collision between the two trains has taken place when the Garden Express was changing the track at Akhaura railway junction

 Shyamlal Kanti Das, in-charge of Akhaura railway station, said that 12 people died on the spot and three died in the hospital
 unhone kaha, "bachaav abhiyaan jari he"

 jab do saal pehle garbh nirodhak goliyaan (aai-pil) or duusari apatkaaleen garbhanirodhak goliyaan (isipies) bazaar main laai gayi to isamen koi shaq nahin tha ki ve bhartiya mahilaon main behad lokapriy sabit hongi
 Because every year 1 in India
 1 karod garbhpaat hote hai, jo ek record he or dhakkadaayak baat yah ki garbhpaat se sambandhit samasyaon ke kaaran inamen se 20,000 mahilaon kii maut ho jaati he
 In such a situation, what can be a better way to get rid of the problem of pregnancy after taking the pill, because its success rate is 95 percent if taken within 12 hours after unprotected mating
 is avadhi ke baad, in goliyon ke nirmaataaon kaa spasht rup se kahana he ki yah garbhanirodh ke liye kargar nahin hogi
 They also clarify that these are emergency contraceptives, and more importantly, these pills are not an alternative to regular contraception in which unwanted pregnancies are completely prevented

 This controversy is arising over originality, as some people are objecting to the advertisements of these pills, in which young men are shown as their real consumers

 These are prohibited on religious grounds only in the Middle East and parts of South America

 However, most doctors agree that ecps are safe, even if they are used for a long time
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki inke durupyog par abhi zyada shodh nahin hua he
 Although the manufacturers of these pills insist on the word 'emergency', many doctors say that young women, even married women, use them as regular contraceptive pills

 " On Sunday, when the Sangh Sanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a senior BJP leader, launched the 'discussion in a cordial atmosphere on reservation' in the concluding speech of the Sangh's 'gyan Utsav' program organized on the competitive exam in Delhi
 The leader recalled his time with former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (admitted to AIIMS)
 bhagwat kaa bayaan or jetali ke zikr main talmail yah he ki aise maukey par (asamyik mudde par bayaan) jetali film mughale ajam kaa dialog sunaate the jisamen akbar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe pruthviraj kapur kehete hai, ''saleem tumhen marane nahin degaa or ham tumhen jeene nahin denge anaarakali!''khayr! aarakshan par charchaa kii jarurat sangh ne mahasoos kii he isliye apane vaicharik sanghathan par hamalavar hone kaa mauka bhaajapa ke paas nahin he lekin party badi hoshiyaari se sangh kii manshaa samajhate hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ke us bayaan ko doharaati he ki, 'aarakshan tha, he or rahegaa'
 However, the Sangh has not spoken of abolishing the reservation or reviewing it, but has brought political disturbance by talking about the discussion
 ahm baat timming kii bhi he
 The Sangh chief gives his views on various issues during various events, but on a sensitive issue like reservation, it usually comes at a time which is not suitable for the BJP
 is baar bhi sangh pramukh kii taraf se aarakshan kaa vishay aise samay chhedaa gaya he jab puri bhaajapa jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ke tahat hasil vishesh darja hataane or use do centreshasit pradeshon jammu-kashmir or ladakh main baantne par apana peeth thapthapa rahi he
 The opposition, especially the Congress, was also split with this master stroke
 party ke puraane se lekar nae netaaon tak ne khulkar samarthan jaahir kiya
 Not only this, the Modi government has already done concrete work in the second agenda of the Sangh by declaring triple talaq as illegal and the Ram temple issue is on its way to be resolved soon
 is tarah bhaajapa ne sangh ke us saare agenda ko kamovesh puraa kar diya he jisaki himaayat sangh karata aayaa he
 Now the Sangh has no solid basis to pressure the BJP
 aise main siyaasi galiyare main yah sawaal charchaa main he ki kya sangh dabaav banane ke nae mudde talash rahaa he?darasal ye teen mudde aise rahe hai, jinako lekar sangh, endie-1 kii vaajapeyi sarkaar or endie-2 kii modi sarkaar par dabaav banaata rahaa he
 But with the formation of the NDA 3 (modi-2) government, the central government did not allow the union to be an attacker
 modi-2 sarkaar ne shapath lene ke 100 dinon ke andar hi sangh ke paas bhaajapa par hamalavar hone ke jitne bhi hathiyaar the sabko bhothra kar diya
 Sources say that the modi-shah duo did not even understand the need to tell them away from seeking advice from the Sangh about preparing to remove Article 370
 jis tarah se achaanak se yah master stroke chalaa gaya usase sangh bhi achambhit ho gaya
 This is perhaps the first time that the BJP government did not even consult him before embarking on such a big ideological issue of the Sangh
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''jab modi-1 sarkaar ne garibon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan diya to sangh or party ke andar se bhi yah aawaaj uthi thi ki jaise garibon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa vidheyak paas karaayaa gaya, vahi tatparta anuchhed 370 yaa ram mandir ko lekar kyon nahin he? lekin party or sangh ke bheetar aise sawaal uthaane waalon ke paas ab vah mauka bhi khatm ho gaya he jiske jariye sarkaar par dabaav banaaya ja sake
 In such a situation, the issue of reservation is natural to raise its importance
 ''haalanki bhagwat ne pehali baar aarakshan kaa mudda nahin chhedaa he
 He also raised the issue of reservation at the time of Bihar assembly elections in 2015
 us samay to sangh ke paas anuchhed 370 sahit sabhi mudde the jiske jariye vah centre sarkaar ko gher sakati thi
 So how appropriate is it to say today that the raga raga is being waged to convey importance? BJP leader says, "when the opposition raised questions on Bhagwat's statement during Bihar elections, it was said on behalf of the Sangh that reservation is necessary as long as there is discrimination
 ''haalanki yah dodhari talwaar se hamale jaisaa he
 If the Sangh's statement is taken literally, as long as the BJP continues to support reservation, it means that there is a sense of inequality in the country
 bhaajapa agar yah daawa karti he ki desh main samanta ke avasar hai yaa phir asamanta kii khai ghati he, tab sangh kii taraf se aarakshan par samiksha kaa mudda uth saktaa he
 In such a situation, the Sangh can try to create pressure that if the system of reservation in the constitution is not permanent, then how long will it be implemented
 jaise bhaajapa anuchhed 370 ko asthaayee praavdhaan bataakar use hataane ko jaij tehra rahi he, usee daleel ko aadhaar banaakar sangh bhaajapa ko aainaa dikhaa saktaa he ki aarakshan bhi asthaayee praavdhaan he to uski bhi samiksha kyon na kii jaae
 If not, the government believes that inequality in the country is huge
 ye donon baaten sangh ko vah mauka de saktaa he jiske jariye vah bhaajapa ko baikfoot par dhakelne kii koshish kar saktaa he
 However, this statement is not being given much importance within the BJP
 aarakshan par party kaa stand spasht he ki bhaajapa aarakshan kaa samarthan karti he or kisi bhi tarah kii samiksha yaa charchaa kii jarurat nahin samajhati he
 But the statement made by the Sangh chief cannot be spontaneous
 sangh pramukh ne yah bhi kaha he ki sarkaar, bhaajapa or sangh alag-alag hai
 All three have different identities
 yah sahi he ki sangh ke kai log party or party kii aguwai vaali sarkaar main hai
 They listen to the Sangh but they do not necessarily agree with the Sangh, they can also disagree
 yani sangh pramukh kaa yah bayaan kaayam he ki, ''sauhadrapurn mahaul main jo aarakshan ke samarthak hai ve aarakshan kaa virodh karne waalon kii baaten sunen or jo aarakshan ke virdohi hai ve aarakshan ke samarthan karne waalon kii baat sunen to maamle kaa samaadhaan ek minute main ho jayega
 "all India publicity head of the Sangh, Arun Kumar, does not reject Bhagwat's statement
" arun kumaar ke mutabik sar sanghachaalak ne, ''samaaj main sadbhavnapurna paraspar baatcheet ke aadhaar par sab prashnon ke samaadhaan kaa mahatv bataate hue aarakshan jaise samvedansheel vishay par vichaar vyakt karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 An attempt is being made to create unnecessary controversy on one part of the speech
 ''sangh kii taraf se spashtikaran jarur diya gaya lekin bhagwat ke is bayaan ne vipakshi dalon ko bhaajapa par hamalaa karne kaa ek mauka jarur de diya he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, the head of the Congress's media department, says, "bhagwat's comment has exposed the anti-dalit face of the RSS and BJP
 '' congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne twit kar kaha he ki, ''aresas kaa hausala badha hua he or mansoobey khatarnaak he
 When the BJP government is strangling the Janapaksadhar laws one by one, the RSS has also raised the issue of debating reservation
 '' basapa pramukh mayawati ne bhi twit kar kaha he ki, bhagwat ke bayaan se essi / essi or obisi varg main ek khatarnaak sanshay paidaa ho gaya he
 Bhagwat's statement has given the opposition parties a weapon, knowingly or unknowingly
 saal ke ant tak haryana, maharashtra, jharkhand jaise bhaajapa shasit rajyon main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 Opposition parties may raise the issue in elections
 isliye bhaajapa main bhagwat ke bayaan kii timming ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 By the way, the union chief advocates the discussion on reservation and also states its need
 lekin charchaa shuru koun karegaa or kaise karegaa
 BJP does not want to discuss for political reasons
 sangh kaa koi bhi anushangik sanghathan seminar yaa vyaakhyaan yojit kar charchaa kii pahal kare (2019 main bhaajapa kii badi jeet ke baad) isaki ummid nahin ke baraabar he
 In such a situation, the discussion will obviously begin with the opposition camp
 shaayad isi ke maddenjar sangh pramukh ne yah baat kahi he
 Election can be the time when the Union also raises the question about the Uniform Civil Code that when there is a uniform civil code in a state like Goa for years, then there should be a discussion to implement it in BJP ruled states
 sangh kaa yahi agenda vah plateform taiyaar karegaa jis par aparaajey bhaajapa-sangh ke saath sauhadrapurn maahaul main charchaa karne ke liye vichaar kare
 With the increasing size of the Sangh's difficulty, the Sangh's hold on the Sangh becomes a cadre of the BJP parallel to the Sangh in every section of the society
 Ayodhya is also on the verge of settling after section 370, the threat of the Sangh being devoid of ideological issues with the Sangh
 The Sangh's favorite in the lowering body and organization does not pay attention
