 supreme court ne bihar ke jahanabad ilaake ke RLD vidhayak par 10 lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya he
 The Supreme Court was angered over the filing of a frivolous petition
 sijeai khehar ne kaha ki aap janata ke pratinidhi hai iskaa matlab yah nahin ki aap supreme court ke adhikaron kaa durupyog karenge
 Ravindra Singh, MLA from Arwal area of jehanabad district, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court in 1994 seeking an inquiry on an article printed in a magazine
 yachika main kaha gaya ki yah lekh pichhadi jatiyon ke khilaaf he or isaki jaanch honi chahie
 The comments CJI ne kaha ki yah lekh 1994 kaa he or aap ab aa rahe hai
 The petitioner's lawyer said that he read it in 2013 and after that the petition was filed in the Patna High Court
 pichley disambar main hi hoicourt ne yachika khaarij kii he, lekin supreme court ne kaha ki hamen yah samaj nahin aa rahaa ki yah yachika kyon daakhil kii gai he isliye yachikakarta par das lakh kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 When the lawyer asked for forgiveness, the CJI told a story of a student being fined Rs 25 when he was studying in the hostel, but the student protested and said why only Rs 25? Should be more because i come from a very rich family
 aap vidhayak hai aapako bhi chaatr kii tarah kahana chahie
 The CJI said that this article is from 1994 and you are coming now
 yachikakarta ke vakil ne bataaya ki unhone 2013 main yah padhaa or iske baad patna hoicourt main yachika daakhil kii gai
 Last December itself, the High Court dismissed the petition, but the Supreme Court said that we do not understand why this petition has been filed, so the petitioner is fined one million
 vakil ne is par maaf karne ko kaha to CJI ne apni ek kahani sunai ki jab vah hostel main padhate the to ek chaatr ko 25 rupee jurmaana laga, lekin us chaatr ne is par virodh jataayaa or kaha ki sirf 25 rupee kyon? zyada hona chahie kyonki main bade amir parivaar se hum
 You are an MLA, you should also say like a student

 is parv par hindu samaaj ke log apane-apane tareeke se dharmik anushthan or daan-punya karke apane pitaron kii aatma kii shanti kii kaamana karte hai
 But the Sunrise Ashram of Indore is running a campaign to plant saplings in the memory of fathers
 yah santhaan beete teen varshon se purvajon kii yaad main paudhe ropakar unke rakh-rakhaav kii bhi jimmedaari nibhaataa aa rahaa he
 According to the tradition of Sanatan Dharma, Pitrupaksha comes once a year
 yah parv 15 din kaa hota he, jisamen purvajon ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that ancestors are not physically among us, but their existence lives around us in some form, that is, the soul is immortal
 pitrupaksh main pitaron kaa samaran kar pindadaan se lekar anndaan, vastradaan kar kashton se mukti kii kaamana kii jaati he
 During this 15 day festival, the Sunrise Ashram in Indore plants saplings to keep the memory of the ancestors alive
 ashram kii ore se aam logon ko purvajon kii yaad main paudha lagane ke liye prerit kiya ja rahaa he
 Not only this, those who are not able to do so, plant saplings from the ashram in the name of their ancestors
 aadhyatmik sant bhayyuji maharaj kaa maananaa he ki aaj duniya global varmig ke daur se guzar rahi he
 The balance of the environment is being severely affected by the cutting of trees
 varsha aadi par bhi asar pad rahaa he
 In this situation, the environment can be saved by planting saplings
 is abhiyaan ke tahat maharashtra ke khamgaanv va tulajapur main paudhe rope jate hai
 So far 9,000 plants have been planted in the memory of fathers
 ashram ke anil paradesi bataate hai ki is yojana ke mutabik sambandhit vyakti dwaara apane purvaj kaa naam, pataa or nidhan kii taarikh kaa byoraa die jane par puure 15 din tarpan kiya jaataa he or ashram kii ore se unke naam par ek paudha rope diya jaataa he
 a tree with the details of that person is placed on this tree
 yah vriksh devvruksh (pipal, bargad va odambar aadi) hota he
 The photo of the planted plant is sent to the concerned family members so that they can visit the tree at any time
 ek taraf jahaan ashram kii ore se vriksharopan kiya jaataa he, vahiin indore sthit ashram main pitrupaksh main vishesh puja-archana kaa daur chalata he
 Kanya Banquet and Havan etc
 uske baad bhayyuji maharaj ke sanidhya main antim din maharashtra ke buldhaana jile ke khamgaanv main rishi sankul pardi ashram shaala ke alaava prastaavit pitruvan main paudhon kaa ropan kiya jaataa he
 While the plantation on the ancestral side of the Sunrise Ashram can preserve the memories of ancestors for a long time, this effort can prove to be an effective campaign to protect the environment
 shart yahi he ki is abhiyaan ko har varg kaa saath mili

 "witch" is a word that is deeply ingrained in the minds of the people of India
 aapane gaanv-dehaat ke ilaakon main to iske dehshat ke kisse bhi khub sune honge
 People are also caught in the spell of witchcraft and tantrik while doing such things on the day of arrival
 lekin kya aapane kabhi aisa dekha yaa suna he kii chudail kahi pe aisa "bavandar" le aae ki chaaron taraf koharaam much jaae? ji haa agar aapane is tarah kii koi chiz nahin dekhi yaa suni ho to yah video ko dil tham ke pehle dekh lijie, jisane is samay soshal media ke platform pe bhuuchaal laa diya he
 Currently a video running on social media is becoming very viral
 is video ko kenya ke ek kshetra ukambani gaanv kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 Where the preparations for the religious program of the church were made in a field
 kursiyaan, mej, band-baaje or electronic upkarnon bhi lagaai gai thi
 The video shows that the event was well organized and just waiting for guests to arrive
 gaanv ke logon ke saath carch ke sadsy vahaan dhire-dhire pahunch rahe the ki achaanak vahaan us maidan main banwder aa jaataa he
 The tornado also causes storms in the ground
 bavandar ke kaaran puure maidan main lagi plastic kii kursiyon ko ek-ek karke hawa main udana shuru ho jaati hai
 Electronic devices and bands installed there also fly away
 achaanak aae is bavandar se vahaan maujuud log khauf main aa kar shor machaate hue idhar -udhar bhaagna shuru kar dete hai
 Some people dare to start capturing the entire incident on mobile
 baad main soshal media main log is prakritik ghatana ko chudail se jod kar bataane lage
 It was said that the witch present there did not want the religious program to take place
 kuch log ise jaadu-tone se bhi jodate hue kah rahe hai ki kenyayi kshetra ukambani gaanv us ilaake main jaaduugari ke liye prasiddh he
 Probably, some of the people present there brought such a whirlwind
 to kya sach main chudail yaa kisi jaadugar ke dwaara ne is ghatana ko anjaam diya tha
 According to media reports, it is said that this video was first posted on youtube on 1 August 2018 by a man named Samuel Maina
 uske baad logon ne ise dekhnaa or viral karnaa sharu kar diya
 According to local media, it is also being said in the report that Ukambani, a village in Kenya, where this tornado incident took place
 use jaaduugaron or jaadu-tone karne waalon kaa kshetra kaha jaataa he
 Ghana's News Website "yen
 com
 GH "has also featured this event on priority
 kai log soshal media pe iskaa majaak bhi uda rahe hai or kah rahe hai ki ye volta kshetra he
 If you are going to do religious work, next time ask for permission first
 kuch saal pehle media reports ke anusaar november 2014 main kenya main 'kaale jaadu' 'juju' kii vajah se jab maidan par tiimon ke samarthak ke bich hinsa or dange bhadakne ke baad ek footbal match ko radd karnaa padaa
 a few years ago, Citizen TV journalist Michael Jenga and his cameraman Rashid of Kenya arrived in the Kenyan city of Kiambu reporting on the world of wizards
 vahaan in logon ne ek vyapaaree banakar vahaan ke prasiddh mahila jaadugar or tantric se mili
 Told that they have incurred losses in the business and therefore have reached them
 mahila tantric ne pehle jaadu-tone ke liye unhen kuch saamaan laane ko kaha or saamaan laane pe ilaaj chaalu kar diya
 Meanwhile, journalist Michael Zenga and his cameraman Rashid secretly started making videos
 lekin patrkaar maaikel jenga ko us vaqt jhatka laga jab unhone dekha ki unke camere ne shuruaati kuch minute ke baad kuch record nahin kiya
 At first it felt like this happened due to some technical reason
 isliye ye log dubaara vahaan gaye or record karne kii koshish kii lekin phir se shuruaati kuch minute ke badakuch record nahinho paaya
 After this incident, journalist Michael Jenga said that i do not believe in witchcraft but am surprised by this incident
 lekin kya aaj ke is vaigyanik yug main is tarah ke prakritik ghatana ko chudail yaa jaadu se jod kar dekha ja saktaa he? to iskaa jawaab na main hi hoga
 Because tornado is a geographical and seasonal phenomenon, which has been seen all over the world
 kahin bhi kisi mausam main aa sakati he

 aapako yaad dilaa den ki iphone XS kii keemton kii shuruyaat 999 dollar se shuru hoti he or Galaxy S10 Plus kii shuruaati keemat 999
 99 dollars

 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh nesanjay singh ke pramotion vivadaper safai di he
 Describing the Congress allegations as baseless, he said that he has no relation with Sanjay Singh
 gauratlab he ki congress ne sanjay singh ko raman singh kaa 'saalaa' bataaya tha or unke teji se pramotion ko lekar sawaal uthaae the
 In response, Raman Singh said that he has no relation with Sanjay and the Congress is making false allegations
 haalanki yah baat pehle se hi jagajaahir thi ki sanjay kii raman singh se rishtedaari nahin he, lekin chunki vah raman singh kii patni ke gaanv ke hai, isliye ek likhit shikaayat ke baad kaagajon par unhen 'mukhyamantri kaa saalaa' kaha jane laga
 Sanjay Congress, who has gone to GMB in three years, alleges that Chief Minister-in-law Sanjay Singh started his job as a class three employee in Madhya Pradesh, but after the formation of the state of Chhattisgarh, he was in the rule of tourism department in 3 years
 
 em
 Has been made haalanki congress ke aaropon ke baad tourism ministar ne maamle kii jaanch kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 According to the Congress, the list of allegations is long on Sanjay Singh, the brother-in-law of the Chief Minister, whose departmental investigation is underway
 party adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ke mutabik sanjay singh ne 1986 main paryaton vibhaag main class thri karmchaaree se apni naukari kii shuruyaat kii, lekin jis tarah se saal dar saal unka pramotion hua usase kai sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 By the year 1993, he was able to reach the senior tourist officer, which is a class two post
 mujhe nahin mila anuchit pramotion: sanjyahalanki jaise hi madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh kaa vibhaajan hua or wo chhattisgarh aaye unki tarakkee kii speed achaanak bad gai
 In 2005, he was directly promoted from Class Two Officer to DGM of Chhattisgarh Tourism Department, which is a Class One post
 iske baad 2008 main unhen ji
 M
 pad se nawaja gaya
 In 2010, with the signature of Chief Minister Raman Singh, he was sent to the Transport Department as Joint Commissioner
 2013 tak sanjay singh transport vibhaag main hi rahe
 In 2013, Sanjay Singh was again given the posting of GM in the tourism department, where he is still working
 sanjay singh kaa apni safai main kahana hai ki unhen kabhi bhi anuchit pramotion nahin mila or na hi unhone mukhyamantri se rishtedaari kaa daawa kar koi phayda uthaaya
 According to him, his promotion case is pending in the Bilaspur High Court
 baavjood iske unhen bevajaah nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Actually, the finger was pointed at Sanjay Singh when the Additional Secretary posted in the Ministry of Chhattisgarh, based on the letter of a complainant, clearly used the words 'act of the Chief Minister's brother' in the government notesheet and sent that note to the Tourism Department
 
 'mukhyamantri ke saale ke karname vaale' sambodhan ke chalate maamle ne tool pakad liya
 Not only this, a notice has been issued by the Ministry in connection with the non-essential work of Rs 6 crore on Sanjay Singh
 in sarkari dastavejon ke ujagar hone ke baad sanjay singh congress ke nishane par aa gaye
 However, he also says that he has no direct relationship with Chief Minister Raman Singh
 chunki ve mukhyamantri kii patni veena singh ke gaanv ke hai, isliye log unhen mukhyamantri kaa saalaa-saalaa kehete hai
 As the controversy over Dinesh Trivedi continues, another dispute between the Congress and Trinamool on a Rajya Sabha seat from West Bengal could be expected as former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is speculating to be the congress-left candidate
 
 trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee ne spasht kar diya he ki vah rajyasabha seat ke liye congress ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan nahin karengi
 At the same time, a section of Congress is strongly of the opinion that the party should not give up the claim on this seat
 yah puche jane par ki kya is seat ke liye loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh congress or vammorcha ke sanyukt ummidavaar ho sakate hai, congress main pashchim bengal ke prabharee shakeel ahamed ne kaha, ‘main na to isse inkaar kar rahaa hum or na hi isaki pushti
 It is not to my knowledge
 is par charchaa nahin hui
 'significantly, in the 294-member West Bengal Assembly, 185 members of the Trinamool Congress, 60 members of the Left Front, 42 members of the Congress, four members of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, two each are SUCI and Independents
 rajyasabha main trinmul ko spasht rup se teen seat mil jaayegi kyonki iske liye pratham variyata ke rup main 50
 There is a vote of 50 members
 vam morcha ko ek seat milengi
 After this, the Trinamool has 35 votes while the Left Front has 10 votes
 congress ko lagata he ki vah ek seat jeet sakati he kyonki use 43 sadasyon kaa samarthan he
 There is speculation in the media and political circles that former Speaker of Lok Sabha Somnath Chatterjee may be sent to the Rajya Sabha as an independent candidate provided the Congress and the Left Front decide together
 is vishay main sampark karne par somnath ne kaha, ‘yah mere liye khabar he
 i have no idea about this
 ’ udhar jab shakeel ahamed se yah poocha gaya ki kya congress or vammorcha kaa sanyukt ummidavaar hoga, to unhone kaha, ‘is samay vammorcha ke saath sanyukt ummidavaar kaa prashn nahin he
 He said that Somnath has been an eminent MP and the Congress respects him
 18 saal kii umr main 10veen ke chaatr ko pyaar ho gaya
 Love is twice the age of my own teacher and that too to the extent of madness
 itnaa ki phone par phone
 The teacher was extremely disturbed by the repeated missed period of her own student
 usne chaatr ko samajhane kii behad koshish kii lekin jab chaatr ne tang karnaa band nahi kiya to majabuuran teacher ne apane bhai or pati se isaki shikaayat kar di
 The fight between the teacher's brother and the student turned into a fight and the matter reached the police station
 teacher ke inkaar se chaatr itnaa agbabula tha ki usne teacher par hi yon shoshan kaa aarope laga diya
 In the case, the police arrested the teacher's brother while the police did not take any action on the teacher's complaint
 maamla court main pahunchaa to court ne police ko fatkaarte hue teacher kii shikaayat par jaanch karne ke aadesh de die
 The court was very serious in this matter
 court ne kaha ki ye behad samvedansheel or samaaj kii aankh kholane vaala maamla he or sarkaar ko is tarah ke maamlo main khaas taur se ladakon ke skulon main padhaane vaali mahila teacheron kii garima or suraksha ko lekar gabhir rukh apanaate hue thos kadam uthaane hoge
 At the same time, both of them stressed the need for counseling
 lekin court main aayaa ye maamla ye to saaf kar hi gaya ki samaaj ke badlaav ke bich guru or shishy ke is rishte ko saamaanya nahin kaha ja saktaa

 (input ieenes se bhi) (also from input IANS) dasvin ke baad 11veen or 12veen main padhane vaale chaatro ke paas ab tak keval science, commers or orts kaa opshan tha
 In view of the increasing competition, CBSE has given students the opportunity to read many new subjects

 CCE has spoiled the level of students in the name of examination, the stress level of students increases
 stress ko kam karne ke liye sibiesai ne dasvin kii board pariksha ko khatm karke sisii yani (continuous and comprehensive evaluation) system loch kiya tha
 According to experts, now the stress of CCE is disturbing the students and teachers themselves

 Some experts also believe that now the students have tension to complete the assignment throughout the year
 jaankaar or chaatro kii raay dekhte hue lagata he ki sisii ko lekar zyaadaatar log iske paksh main nahin hai
 They believe that the old board format was better

 ek taraf purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ne jail se nikalate hi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko paristhitiyon kaa netaa bataa diya
 In the latest development, a photo of Mohammed Kaif, an absconding criminal, has emerged in Nitish's cabinet with number three and Lalu Yadav's son Tej Pratap Yadav
 tejpratap ke ek nahin kai photo media main aane ke baad spasht he ki caff na keval tejpratap ko jaanate the balki lalu yadav ke nivas, jahaan tejpratap apane mata-pita ke saath rahete hai, main unka berokatoke aana-janaa tha
 The comments yah caff hai koun? yah siwan ke nivasee hai, jinka naam surkhiyon main patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatya main aayaa tha
 Arrested shooter Rohit Soni in this case admitted in his statement that Kaif had told him to run away when he was going with other companions after killing Rajdev
 police is bayaan ke aadhaar par uski talash kar rahi thi
 However, Siwan police say that five other cases are pending against Kaif in which he is accused in the cases of theft, extortion and robbery
 ek maamle main uske khilaaf court kaa warrant bhi lambit he
 When Shahabuddin was released on Saturday, Kaif was standing next to him
 mangalvaar ko vah siwan ke pratappur main shahabuddin ke ghar par baitha dikhaa tha
 On coming in front of the media, Kaif clarified that if the police is looking for him, he will appear with the advice of his lawyer
 usne tejpratap ke saath apni tasviir ko asli bataaya

 saal tha 2005, jab popular mujeec compoger or singer himesh reshmia ne apane ek gane se bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki bollywood main jaldi hi deepika padukon naam kii ek sundar bala entry maaregi or uski safalataa ke kisse log sunaae nahin thakenge
 Do not be surprised, you must have seen that video song, 'you have heard the heart of the wall, Naam hai tera tera'! Well, this is a joke lekin koun jaanata tha ki 2005 main us video song main ai ek ladki ek din film industry main shoharat ke saath-saath safalataa kii anginat seedhiyaan chadhegi or dekhte hi dekhe ek youth ikon ban jaaegi! deepika padukon kii bollywood main entry hui saal 2007 menshahrukh ke apojit film 'om shaanti om' se or mahaj 8 salmen vah unheen kii badi film ko box offis par takkar dene vaali badi star bhi ban gayi
 Deepika's achievements in her career of less than a decade are truly astonishing - more than 25 films, small and big over 65 awards, 'live, Love, Laugh' Foundation, 'all About You' fashion brand, from Twitter The long queue of fans till Facebook and the maximum number of movies in the club of 100 crores as an actress
 vaaki deepika bollywood kaa sabase chamakta 'tara' hai
 Let's know some exciting things about Deepika
 2015 kii oleroundernational level badminton player ne bollywood main ek se badhkar ek shot dikhaae hai or har role main apana sikaa manvaaya he
 From comedy to romance and from mafia to the battlefield, Deepika has left no stone unturned
 2015 main unhone 'piku', 'tamaasha' or 'bajirao mastaani' jaisi teen bilkul alag tarah kii filmein kin or teenon hi box offis par khub chalin
 In the same year, Saldipika also started a fashion clothing line with her foundation and a shopping website about depression
 isi saal fasebuk par deepika ke 30 million se zyada folbers hue or twitor par unako follow karne waalon kii sankhya 15 million paar kar gai
 When Ranveer Singh's Lucky Charm joined the name of 'ram-leela' in 2013, Ranveer's days also reversed
 jis din se deepika ne ranvir kii jindagi main entry maari he, industry main unke sitare buland ho gaye
 Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali also cast the two together again in 'bajirao Mastani' after 'ram-leela' and their chemistry surpassed that of another Bollywood senior and superhit duo at the box office
 deepika bhale hi abhi hichakati hai lekin ranvir apni is lucky charm ke saath aksar'public disple of afections'karte dikhte hai
 Deepika, who came into the limelight with a double role in 'om Shanti Om', pulls the film alone, Chandni Chowk to China, Love Aaj Kal, Lafange Parinde, After Break, Reservation, Desi Boys, Cocktail, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Chennai Express, Goliyon Ki rasleela-ram Leela, Finding Feni, Happy New Year, Piku, Tamasha and bajajirao-mastanija have done many popular films
 critics maanate hai ki deepika aaj apane kariyar ke is mukaam par hai ki unhen film hit karaane ke liye yaa theatre housephul karwaane ke liye kisi popular mail lead actor kii jarurat nahin he
 The big actors want to film with them themselves
 fishan line kii shuruyatsaal 2015 main hi deepika padukon ne online shopping site 'mintra' ke saath milakar apni cloding line 'ol about you' launch kii he
 If sources are to be believed, Deepika has worked hard for about 9 months with 'myntra' and French design agency 'carlin'
 fishan exparts ne unki line ko eligant or smart bataaya he
 Bollywood's endorsement Queendeepika believes that beauty is not enough to make a mark in the world
 confidence or sahi atitude bhi jaruri he
 Due to this spirit, Azadipika is the face of more than 20 top brands
 apane parents ke saath bhi vah vigyapanon main najar aa chuki hai
 Especially the advertisement he did with his mother was heart touching
 100 karod club kii ranicocktel, res 2, ye javaani he divaani, chennai express, goliyon kii raasalila-ram lila, happy new year, piku, tamaasha or bajirao mastaani jaisi filmon ke sathdipika 100 karod club kii sabase zyada filmenkarne vaali bollywood actress ban chuki hai
 The special thing is that Bollywood, which usually does not give success credits to heroines, is keeping Deepika equal to the heroes in this achievement
 'maay chois' videovumana empowerment ko lekar vog india or diarector homi adzania ke video 'maay chois' ko karnaa deepika ke liye vivaadit rahaa
 For this she also had to face severe criticism but Deepika took it very politely
 yah unki skill he ki iskaa unke kariyar or image par koi fark nahin padaa
 Accepting Depression In 2015, Deepika revealed that she had suffered from depression in 2014
 ek taraf jahandipikaco har jagah se vaahvahee mil rahi thi, vahiin duusari ore ek subah achaanak subah uthte hi unhen apni jindagi khaali-khaali si lagi
 He ignited this feeling for a few days, but suddenly one day he got angry in front of his mother
 apane depressant se ladakar khud ko sanbhaalane ke baad 'world mental health de' ke maukey par aise logon kii madad ke liye deepika ne is foundation ko shuru kiya
 May be friendship with X
 Ranbir Kapoor, who was Mendeepika's boyfriend in the past, is happy with Katrina Kaif in her real life today
 vahiin deepika bhi ranvir singh ke saath aage bad gai hai
 Such breakups are common in Bollywood but often stars do not forget the bitterness about these things
 lekin ranbir se dosti hi nahin, unke saath filmein bhi kar deepika ne vaaki ek misaal pesh kii he
 Which teaches youngsters to progress at both professional and personal levels
 sanvaidhanik maamalon ke jaankaar va supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta ne samachar agency se kaha, "floor test ke dauraan yadi ajit pavaar or jayant patil (nae vidhayak dal netaa) donon ne vip jari kar diya to bahumat kii sankhya main vivaad ke saath dalbadal kaa maamla bhi banegaa
 In that case the role of the speaker will be important
 bahumat, spikar kaa chunaav or dalbadal jaise maamalon par vivaad kii sthiti main supreme court main agle round main phir se maamla aa saktaa he
 "virag Gupta continued," Ajit Pawar's whip can get legitimacy on two points
 masalan, sharad pavaar ne unhen vidhayak dal ke netaa ke pad se hataaya he magar party se nahin hataaya he
 On the other hand, the leader of the Mahavikas Aghadi coalition government is being talked about by three parties, its leader was not formally informed to the Supreme Court
 " ensipi ke kul 54 vidhayak hai
 If the speaker considered Ajit Pawar's whip, then the votes of 53 other mlas who went against his decision would be nullified
 jisase bahumat ke liye aankada 118 rah jayega
 The BJP currently has the arrangement of so many mlas
 bhaajapa ke paas apane 105 or 13 nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 In the presence of Devendra Fadnavis, 118 mlas were present in the meeting held recently
 bhaajapa ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki shapath se pehle ajit pavaar ne vidhayak dal ke netaa kii haisiyat se samarthan patr diya tha, is naate kanoonee pech nahin fansata
 On the question of whether the government was formed in Maharashtra, but what will be able to remain stable, BJP national spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal told the news agency, "ajit Pawar supported the BJP as a Legislature Party leader, so that bjp's Legislature Party Leader Devendra Fadnavis became the Chief Minister, there is no obstacle
 sadan main party bahumat sabit karke rahegi
 "the strategy of getting resignation from mlas is also the way in Karnataka, by running 'operation Kamal', the BJP can work in Maharashtra by reducing the majority of the figures by getting resignation from the mlas of the opposing parties
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki dalbadal kanoon se bachane ke liye kisi party ke do-tihaai vidhayakon kaa tootna jaruri he
 In such a situation, by resigning from several mlas of the three parties, the BJP would like to bring the majority figure so close as far as it can reach
 haalanki bhaajapa ke liye yah bahut aasaan nahin he

 If the Dalit organizations expressed their displeasure towards the government, then the opposition parties also surrounded the government on this issue
 sarkaar is mudde par pichley kuch dinon main baikfoot par dikhi
 But now the government is going to take big steps to convince the Dalits
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne india today ko bataaya ki sarkaar ke paas sabhi raste khule hai
 According to sources in the government, the Law Ministry is preparing to bring an ordinance on this
 haalanki, sarkaar ne is par supreme court main punarvichaar yachika bhi daali he
 Nevertheless, the government does not want to take any risk due to the ever increasing public and political pressure
 sutron kii maane to agar supreme court main daali gai punarvichaar yachika se koi hal nahin nikalataa he to sarkaar adhyadesh kii taraf kadam badha sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, on Monday, Ravi Shankar Prasad spoke to Home Minister Rajnath Singh for a long time on the issue of ordinance
 haalanki, sarkaar kii taraf se is par koi tippanee nahin kii gai
 Government sources clearly say that the government believes that the Supreme Court cannot make laws, it is the job of Parliament to make laws
 haalanki, sarkaar adhyadesh laaegi yah abhi tay nahin he kyonki is maamle par punarvichaar yachika bhi daali ja chuki he

 It is worth mentioning that only after the order of the Kisupreme Court, Dalit organizations called India off on April 2

 He was born on 8 August 1932
 dada kii filmon ke tital bhi aise hote the ki sensor board ko film paas karne main paseene chhot jate the
 The censor board could not ban these double meaning titles even after trying it all
 film industry main lambii pari khilne ke baad 14 march, 1998 ko mumbai ke dadar main dada kondke kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Dada Kondke's 1975 film Pandu Havaldar was very popular
 isamen unhone tital kairactor nibhaayaa tha
 It was only after this film that the Havildars came to be called Pandu
 unki anya charchit filmon main songarya, aali angavar aadi hai
 Kondke is also famous for his Marathi drama 'vichha Majhi Puri Kara'

 The title contender, India, will be eyeing revenge when it faces co-hosts Bangladesh in the opening match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup on Saturday
 mahendra singh dhoni kii team haalanki puri tarah satark hogi, kyonki koi bhi kotahi use baari pad sakati he
 The team considered as weak by Bangladesh, after defeating India in the opening match of the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, laid the foundation for the team to be eliminated from the first round and Dhoni and his team avenge the defeat at sher-e-bangla Stadium
 With the goal of making a positive start to its campaign
 khitaab ke daavedaaron main shumaar duniya kii duusare number kii bhartiya team kaaphi santulit he, lekin pratibhavan khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi ke kaaran captain dhoni ko chayan muddon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Dhoni, however, seems to have solved his problem with the batting department when he hinted at Virat Kohli's preference over Suresh Raina after the second practice match against New Zealand
 dhoni ne kaha, number chaar kram hamaare liye kaaphi ahm he
 Right now this place remains like war 
 chauthe number par kohli ko ballebaaji karne kii jarurat he, jabaki gautam gambhir tisare number par utrenge
 Dhoni said, Kohli is such a player who takes a little time to settle down initially and then strikes the bowlers
 phir bhi sambhaavna he ki maujuud form ko dekhte hue viraat ko (suresh) raina par tarjeeh mili
 The Indian captain also indicated that he would feed Yuvraj, as he is important to the team due to his ability to spin the ball despite poor form with the bat
 unhone kaha, ham chaar gendbaajon ke saath khel rahe hai
 The improvised spinner is very important, especially if he is a left-arm spinner who makes the ball spin outward
 anya khilaadiyon ke upar yaheen uskaa (yuvaraj) palada baari he
 The Indian batting attack will be led by Sachin Tendulkar, who is participating in his sixth World Cup tournament and will be eyeing a quick start to India with Virender Sehwag
 gautam gambhir tisare number par ballebaaji karne utrenge, jabaki kohli, dhoni, yuvaraj or yusuf pathan kii maujuudagi main madhyakram kaaphi majboot najar aata he
 All these players have the ability to play big shots and rotate strikes
 bharat ne apane duusare or antim abhyaas match main newjiland ke khilaaf 360 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha or isse ballebaajon visheshkar dhoni or gambhir kaa manobal kaaphi badha hoga
 Dhoni scored an unbeaten 108, while Gambhir smashed 89 runs in this match
 bharat ne 'yorkerman' jasprit bumraah (7 ran dekar 5 wicket) kii tufaani gendbaaji ke dam par pehle test match ke chauthe hi din westeindies ko 318 ranon se karaari maat di
 With this, Team India took a 1-0 lead in the two-match Test series and scored 60 points in their first World Test Championship match
 kam ran dekar zyada se zyada wicket lenaa kisi bhi gendbaaj kaa sapana hota he
 25-year-old Jasprit Bumrah managed to achieve a similar feat in the Antiga Test and made a big record
 bumraah sabase kam ran dekar test kii ek pari main 5 yaa isse zyada wicket (five Wicket haul) lene vaale bhartiya gendbaaj ban gaye
 Prior to Bumrah, this record was in the name of Venkatapathi Raju, who took 6 wickets for 12 runs against Sri Lanka in Chandigarh in 1990

 Crime in Delhi is increasing continuously, but the maximum number of cases come in front of mobile chat
 rojaanaa lakhon ke phone yaa to chhine jate hai yaa chori hote hai
 In such a situation, the police have failed to stop these incidents even if they want to
 haalanki, dilli police ne is baar ek aise gang kaa pardaafash kiya he jo dilli main na sirf mobile kii chori karte, balki chori kii in mobile ko desh se baahar nepal main bech diya karte the
 These gangs used to send mobiles from Nepal to Nepal in a very vicious manner

 a total of 311 smartphones have been recovered from them by the police, whose value is said to be more than 60 lakhs
 yphone se lekar samsung tak vivo se lekar opo tak aisa koi mahangaa phone nahin jo yahaan na rakhaa ho

 lekin isse pehle hi krime branch ne ye mobile baraamad kar liye or puraa gang pakad main aa gaya
 According to Crime Branch DCP Rajesh Dev, a total of 7 people of this gang have been arrested, including Jhapatmar, Buchkar, middleman and finally the person sending the phone to Nepal
 is gange main rohit naam kaa shaks jo mobile chhinta tha
 Mukesh, Naresh, Gopal Pathak and Rajan are the people who used to buy mobiles from Rohit and other dozens of Delhi snugglers
 karolbaag main ek daftar kholkar baitha doosraa naresh in chaaron se mobile kharidta tha, phir naresh ye mobile nepal ke rahane vaale ek ram singh naam ke shaks ko thok main bech detaa tha
 Ram Singh is an employee of a mobile receiver sitting in Nepal who was hired here for the same job
 police is gang ko kareeb ek maheene se trek kar rahi thi
 During investigation, it was found out that the head of this gang is Naresh, who has opened his office in Bidanpura
 is gang main sabake kaam bate hue hai
 The gang was doing its job in a systemic manner
 is gang main zyaadaatar wo log hai jo karolbaag ke gaffaar market main mobile repering kaa kaam karte the, lekin usamen munafa kam hone ke chalate is dhandhe main aa gaye
 According to police, these people used to send about 60 mobiles out of Delhi to Nepal every week
 pichley dedh saal main ye gang kareeb 10 hajaar se zyada mobile nepal bhej chukaa he, jisaki keemat karodo main bataai ja rahi he
 Among the caught mobile phones is 90 iphone
 police ke mutabim ye log mobile is liye nepal main bechate the, taaki phone main iemiai number ke jire bhi inhen pakadaa na ja sake
 Actually, any phone in India can be caught only in India through IMI number
 aise main ek baar ye phone india se baahar gaya to use pakad paanaa behad mushkil he or yahi vajah he ki ye bina phone kaa iemiai number change kiye ise nepal bhej diya karte the
 The crime branch will load the IMEI number of 311 mobile phones recovered from them in two days on the Delhi Police website
 aise main police ne un logon se apil kii he jinke mobile phone chori hue ho yaa gum hue ho, wo apane gaayab hue phone ke iemiai number ke jariye ye check kar le ki kahin in phone main unka bhi phone to nahin he

 Bollywood actor and producer Kamal r Khan has targeted 'bharat' and his actor Salman Khan through his tweet
 Producers of # Bharat are showing the film to media people today at 9pm with the condition that they can't tweet anything about the film till 1pm tomorrow
 Means producers are 100% sure that media people won't say good about it
 This is the blunder done by PR company # Spice! Kamal r Khan, who was part of 'bigg Boss 3', has tweeted about Salman Khan's film 'bharat' (bharat) in his post on Twitter
 kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twitor par likhaa 'film bharat (bharat) ke nirmaataa aaj raat 9 baje media ko is shart ke saath film dikhaa rahe hai ki vah iske bare main kal dopaher 1 baje tak kuch bhi twit nahin karenge

 In a significant development, India did not vote for the first time on Thursday on a resolution brought against the US on Sri Lanka on the issue of alleged human rights violations
 sanra maanavadhikaar parishad main is prastaav ko 12 ke mukaable 23 maton se paarit kiya gaya jabaki 12 sadasyon ne matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 According to the statement given at the time of the vote by Dilip Sinha, Permanent Representative of India in the local UN office, this resolution of the UN Human Rights Council imposes an interventionist approach to the international investigative system
 bharat ke anusaar yah prastaav vipareet nattejey dilaane vaala he tathaa yah 'asangat evam avyaavhaarik' he
 This is the first time since 2009 that India has not participated in voting for a resolution on 'reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka'

 He noted that unlike the 2009, 2012 and 2013 resolutions, the UN Human Rights High Commissioner calls for an 'investigation, assessment and monitoring' of the human rights situation in Sri Lanka
 yah ek hastkshep karne vaala ravaiya he jisase rashtriya samprabhutaa kamatar hoti he
 Sinha said, "india strongly believes that national sovereignty and institutions are inferior due to interfering attitude and this leads to adverse results
" sarthak antarrashtriya vaarta evam sahyog ke mul siddhant se koi bhi mahatvapurn vichlan main maanavadhikaar sangrakshan evam moolbhoot swatantraaaon ke saarvbhaumik sammaan ke liye maanavadhikaar parishad dwaara kiye ja rahe prayaas kamatar hone kii sambhaavna rahati he

 This investigative mechanism is also allowed to monitor the national process of protection of human rights in a country
 bharat ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'bharat kaa sadaiv yah mat rahaa he ki srilanka main sangharsh samaapt hone ke kaaran ek aisa anoothaa avasar utpann hua he jisamen tamilon sahit srilanka ke sabhi samudaayon ko sweekaarya sthaayee raajnneetik samaadhaan ko talash ja saktaa he
 ' bayaan ke anusaar 'bharat kaa maananaa he ki is parishad ke prayaason ko maanavadhikaar ke protsaahan evam sangrakshan ke raashtra dwaara swayan kiye ja rahe prayaason main yogadan dena chahie
 We strongly support Sri Lanka's continued support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
