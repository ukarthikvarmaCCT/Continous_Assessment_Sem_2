 Vidya Dhan is not being given anywhere on such a large scale
 bina kisi bhedbhaav ke itane bade paimaane par kaam ho rahaa he, lekin sapa prachaar main peeche he
 He alleged that SP was a party of Muslims only
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi puch liya
 We responded har varg kii baraabar kii bharpai kii ab unheen logon ke tevar badal gaye
 There was talk of suffering in relief camps

 Why did she stop, you know better
 is seva se bade paimaane par garibon ko madad mil rahi he
 Running such a large ambulance service and no finger was raised on the government

 These become a major reason for big scams and money transactions in private schools

 The Delhi High Court has told the government that seats in the EWS category should not be left vacant

 This is a big challenge for India because these figures are a clear indication that China is once again going to enter the era of fast-moving economy

 a shocking incident has surfaced from the capital of Karnataka, Bengaluru
 bengalooru ke vibhutipura main ravivaar ko ek pita ne apane naaballig bete ko faansee ke fande par lataka uski jaan le lee, itnaa hi nahin usne apni patni ko bhi marane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When this father was carrying out this act, his daughter captured the whole incident in her mobile phone
 ye video soshal media par viral ho gaya he, jisaki vajah se puraa vivaad khadaa hua
 The father of the local police arrested Suresh as soon as the incident was revealed
 marane waalon kii pahchaan gita bai (38 varsh) or varun (12 varsh) se hui he
 Giving information about the incident, the local police said that the incident took place on Sunday night
 pehle suresh ne apane bete ko stool par khadaa kar latakaaya
 After that Geeta Bai hanged herself
 ye sab jis vakt ghat rahaa tha, to unki beti iskaa video bana rahi thi
 While Suresh was hanging them, there was a noise, shouts were heard
 jiske baad padosi baahar aae or unhone hi police ko alert kiya
 The police immediately reached the spot and arrested Suresh
 hiraasat main usne police ko bataaya ki vah karj chukaa nahin paa rahaa tha, jisase vah pareshaan tha
 His family could not bear this problem, which is why his wife and son committed suicide
 haalanki, police ne jab apni jaanch padtaal shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki usne hi apane bete ko maut ke ghat utaara he
 Suresh is still under police custody and the police is questioning him
 bharat or england ke bich chal rahi maujuuda test siries main team india 2-1 se peeche he, or is nattejey ke liye jimmedaar bhi koi or nahin team ke khilaadi hi hai
 The hope created by Team India by drawing the Trent Bridge Test and winning the Lord's Test was added to the soil by the Indian Surmas in a blink of an eye
 england main test siries jeetne kaa sapana to ab sapana hi rahaa lekin philhal siries bachaane kii chunauti team ke saamne khadi he or team ke paas iskaa koi tod bhi najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The fifth and final test of the series begins on August 15 at Kennington Oval
 bharat ne is maidan par pichley 43 saalon se koi test match nahin jeeta he
 India recorded their first and last Test victory at the ground in 1971 under Ajit Wadekar's captaincy
 ye record bhi bhartiya team ko utsahit nahin karte ki vah jeet kii ummid kare
 The icing on the cake is that even the captain of the team is not ready to take a lesson from defeat
 team india ke ballebaaj jaise hi england pahunche maano aisa lag rahaa he ki vahaan kii cold condishan ke chalate unke balle main bhi barf jam gai he
 Looking at the figures seen in the 4 Tests so far in the series, it seems that it is better if Team India is not expected to win at the Oval
 england ke liye is siries main gairi balance ne akele jitne ran (439) banaae hai utane ran bharat ke teen dhurandharon, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan milakar bhi nahin bana paae hai (437)
 The batsmen's power does not end here, there are 12 times in this series when India's Surma could not open the account
 jabaki england ke liye yah aankada maatr 3 tak hi simit he
 Ben Stokes has been dismissed for 3 times and now he is out of the England team
 siries main england kii taraf se 7 baar shatkeey saajhedaari hui jabaki bharat ke ballebaaj maatr 2 baar hi yah karnama kar paae, jisamen ek baar to bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohammad shami ne sau ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 The mid-order misery makes the figure even more clear that in the last 32 innings, India's batsmen from number 8 to 11 have 27
 12 kii ausat se 651 ran banaae, jisamen 6 ardhashtakeey saajhedaariyaan shaamil raheen
 But the condition of the middle order looks worse than this, with the batsmen from number 4 to number 7, meanwhile, 24
 74 kii behad ghatiya ausat se 767 ran jode, jisamen maatr 5 ardhashtakeey or ek shatkeey saajhedaari hui
 Why only bat, bowlers and fielders also made the current England tour memorable
 jitne kaich bharat ne pakade hai utane tapakaae bhi hai, or kai maukon par to aisa laga ki bharat ne na sirf kaich balki match hi chhod diya
 a total of 125 wickets have fallen in the series so far, with 76 wickets taken by England bowlers and 49 by India bowlers
 team india kii majbootee kahi jane vaali spin gendbaajon kaa haal to or bhi behaal najar aayaa he, or vah siries main sirf 11 wicket hi dilaa sake hai
 While England's Moin Ali alone has taken 19 wickets
 jaahir he in aankadon ko dekhakar koi bhi aahat hoga, lekin dukh kii baat to yah he ki bhartiya khilaadi is siries main lagaataar ek jaisi hi galati karte chale ja rahe hai or unako samajhane vaala koi nahin he

 in / HIV has so far put hundreds of people to death and people are still struggling with it
 vaigyanikon ne us jagah kaa pataa lagaaya he, jahaan se echivi niklaa he
 After research by scientists, it was revealed that HIV came out of Kinshasa and spread its footprint all over the world
 us samay kinshasa belgian kongo kii rajdhani hua karata tha, or leopoldville ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 HIV spread very rapidly here, one of the reasons being that it was a big city in Central Africa and it was a big bushmeat market
 yahaan logon kii awajahi bahut zyada hoti thi to ye virus bhi utani hi teji se fail gaya
 According to an estimate, there are 30 million people worldwide in the grip of AIDS
 oxford uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon ne bataaya ki echivi-1 kii khoj ke 30 saal baad ham yah pataa chalaa ki saal 1920 main central africa ke kinshasa main is virus kii shuruyaat hui
 In their research, scientists also found that 13 types of the virus were exposed to chimpanzees, guerrillas, monkeys and humans, but spread like HIV-1 group m epidemic around the world
 vaigyanikon ne yah bhi paaya ki group 'em' or group 'o', donon prakaar ke virus 1960 ke dashak tak lagbhag ek hi teji ke saath failte rahe, lekin iske baad group 'em' ke failane kii speed teen guna bad gai
 The major reason for this was attributed to the fast-growing needles and fast growing prostitution
 scotland ke glassgo shahar main ek pub par police vibhaag kaa helicopter gir jane se kam se kam 8 logon ke marane kii ashanka he jabaki 32 log ghayal hue hai
 The people enjoying the music band were two police officers and a pilot in the helicopter EC 135 T-2

 At the time of the incident, more than 100 people were present in the pub and were enjoying the music of a music band
 police adhikari roj fitzepatric ne kaha, ‘helicopter main teen log savaar the
 It dropped at the pub on Friday night
 haadase ke samay pub main badi sankhya main log maujuud the

 ' jidipi growth main bharat se bhi aage ho gaya he bangladeshbangladesh garment niryaat ke maamle main kaaphi aage habangladesh ne shram sudhaaron main bhi acchhee safalataa hasil kii haivehaan krishi kshetra kii vikaas dar bhi kaaphi acchhee rahi haiek din bharat ko yah abhas hua ki jidipi growth ke maamle main bangladesh ne use peeche kar diya he
 This happened when the Asian Development Bank (ADB) updated its Asian Development Outlook (ADO) report in September 2019
 haalanki iske pehle ke april outluk main bhi iskaa saaf sanket mil gaya tha
 ADB raised Bangladesh's GDP growth estimate from 8 to 8 for the year 2019
 1 fisadi or bharat ke jidipi growth ko 7
 6 from 2 per cent
 5 fisadi kar diya tha
 In addition, it also retained Bangladesh's GDP growth estimate for 2020 at 8 per cent, while India's growth estimate at 7
 3 fisadi se ghataakar 7
 2 percent
 haalanki, donon deshon ke aadhikarik aankadon or unki vittiya gananaaon kaa istemaal karke dekhen to bangladesh ne is maamle main vitt varsh 2018 main hi peeche chhod diya tha, jise neeche die gaye graph se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 The reason for this is the difference in the fiscal calculations of the two countries
 bangladesh kaa ‘phiscal year’ calendar 1 july se 30 june tak hota he, jabaki bharat kaa phiscal year’ 1 april se 31 march tak
 But ADB uses 'financial Year' for the assessment and calculates the fiscal year of the two countries differently
 udhaaharan ke liye bangladesh ke liye jahaan FY19 30 june ko khatm hota he, vahiin bharat main yah 31 march 2020 tak chalata he
 Bangladesh is getting richer, faster than India
 The ADB report shows that Bangladesh is actually getting richer than India
 iske prati vyakti jidipi main badhat saal 2017 main hi bharat ko peeche chhod diya, jab vahaan isamen 6 fisadi kii badhat dekhi gai, jabaki bharat main 5
 There was an increase of 8 percent
 bangladesh 2020 main bhi 6
 6 per cent will grow at a faster pace, while 5 in India
 9 fisadi kii badhat hi hui thi
 Similarly, Bangladesh is also moving closer to India in terms of GNI (gross National Income) per capita
 saal 2017 main bangladesh kaa prati vyakti GNI 1,470 dollar tha, jabaki bharat kaa 1,800 dollar tha
 In comparison, South Korea's per capita GNI was $ 28,380, China $ 8,690, Sri Lanka $ 3,850 and Pakistan $ 1,580
 bangladesh main aay kii asamanta bhi bharat ke mukaable kam he
 According to undp's Human Development Index and Indications, the Guinea coefcient 32 of Bangladesh between 2010 and 2017
 4 tha, jabaki bharat kaa 35
 Was 1 gini kophisiant se aay main asamanta ko mapa jaataa he
 Zero means complete equality and 100 means complete inequality, ie inequality of income is higher in countries with high scores
 is dauraan dakshin korea main gini kophisiant 31
 6, 42 in China
 2, srilanka main 39
 8 and 30 in Pakistan
 7 he
 That is, Pakistan is also much better in this matter
 haalanki yah baat dhyaan main rakhni hogi ki bangladesh kaaphi chota desh he or uski jansankhya mahaj 16
 1 crore, while India's population is 135
 1 karod tak ho gai he
 According to the World Bank, India's GDP was $ 274 billion in 2018, while India's GDP was 2
 7 trillian (lakh karod) dollar kii
 So the question arises as to what is the secret of Bangladesh's rapid progress in recent years? Professor Salim Rehan of Dhaka University considers four major and one minor factors for this - 1
 radimaid garments kaa niryaat 2
 Money coming from abroad 3
 krishi kaa satat vikaas 4
 Good growth in micro finance and 5
 bade buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon main sarkari kharch badhanaa
 Some experts also consider 'women's empowerment' as a reason
 sanrachanaatmak badlaav: menuphaccharing or niryatonmukh badhatbangladesh kii iconomi main ai teji kii ek khaas visheshta yah he ki bharat ke vipareet vahaan menuphaccharing (audyogikaran) or niryaat main acchhee badhat hui he, jaisaa ki japan, china, dakshin korea or anya asian arthvyavasthaaon ne kiya tha
 a study by ADB found that Bangladesh is one of the Asian countries that has achieved the largest growth in GDP growth and manufacturing in the 1970s to 2010s
 is tarah ke anya deshon main bhutan, cambodia, malaysia, dakshiran korea or thailand shaamil hai
 10 in manufacturing of Bangladesh in last 14 years (FY06 to FY19)
 2 fisadi kii salanaa ausat badhat hui he
 Analysis of the data shows that both Bangladesh and India have the largest contribution of the service sector in production, although their agricultural yields are declining rapidly
 graph se yah spasht he ki bangladesh kii menuphaccharing ne tej udaan bhari he or vahaan kii jidipi main iskaa hissaa kareeb ek-chauthai tak pahunch gaya he
 On the other hand, in the case of India, it is still less than 20 percent
 iskaa nateeja yah he ki bangladesh kii menuphaccharing se zyada naukariyon kaa bhi srijan ho rahaa he
 Agriculture remains the most employment-generating sector, although the contribution of services in both countries is increasing rapidly
 oonche menuphaccharing or export growth kaa netritv garment sector ke haath menitihaas main jaaen to dhaka kaa jamdani muslin (ek prakaar kii malamal) mughal kaal main bhi kaaphi prasiddh tha or isko kharidne ke liye europe se log bartan bhar-bhar kar sona-chaandi laate the
 It requires a lot of skill, so it is quite expensive and only the rich are able to buy it
 ab bangladesh ke radimaid or bune hue kapade vahaan kii arthvyavastha ko nae sire se paribhaashit kar rahe hai
 Professor Rahan explains that Bangladesh has emerged as the second largest exporter of apparel after China
 bangladesh kii menuphaccharing jidipi main iskaa hissaa 45 fisadi or kul jidipi main 7 fisadi he
 It is also the second largest labor intensive manufacturing sector, employing 5 million people
 inamen se 80 fisadi mahilaayein hai or yah sabase teji se badhata hua sector he
 Its contribution to Bangladesh's total exports after FY 2013 is more than 80 per cent

 Amid the uproar in the Rajya Sabha, Home Minister Amit Shah has recommended the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir from Jammu and Kashmir

 is tarah jammu-kashmir masale ko lekar soshal media se lekar har jagah khub riection aa rahe hai
 Writer Chetan Bhagat has also tweeted several successive tweets and has written that Kashmir has finally become free today
 August 5, 2019
 Kashmir is finally free
 Free to grow, free to make a future
 # Article370 goes
 # onecountryonesystemgqha mantri amit shah (amit Shah) ke jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ( Jammu and Kashmir Article 370 of the Constitution of India) hataane kii sifarish ke turant baad hi chetan bhagat (chetan Bhagat) ne twit kiyah '5 agast, 2019
 Kashmir was finally liberated
 tarakkee or behatar bhavishya ke liye aaazaad hua
 Article 370 will be removed
 'kashmir has cost India so much - suffering in the state, terror all over, lakhs of crores in extra defense budget, soldiers losing their lives
 Meanwhile, hundreds of fancy conferences pretending to solve the issue
 Time it all stops
 # onecountryonesystem # article370anyone using the removal of # Article370 as an excuse to disturb peace and instigate violence is an enemy of the state
 Let the country be run peacefully
 Do not do anything you will regret
 # onecountryonesystemarticle 370 never gave Kashmiris freedom
 It only created selfish leaders who created a terror filled society and robbed Kashmiri youth of opportunity
 It is finally time for it to go

 pakistani samudaay main rakt sambandhiyon ke bich hone vaali shaadi se hue ek tihaai bacchon main koi naa koi janm dosha jarur hota he
 This study has been revealed by a study
 daily mail ke mutabik asian samudaay par kii gai apni tarah kii pehali research se pataa chalaa he ki jo chachere bhai-bahan aapas main shaadi karte hai unke bacchon main janm dosha kaa khatra doguna rahata he
 According to Bradford Research, birth defects were found in 6 out of 100 children married to cousins
 jabaki iske ulat jin mata-pita ne rakt sambadhiyon main shaadi nahin kii thi unke 100 main se 3 bacchon main hi janm dosha mila
 There may be controversy on this research
 chachere bhai-bahanon main shaadi saanskrithik or dharmik mudda he isliye ise varjit vishay mana jaataa he
 The research involved 11,300 children born between 2007 and 2011 in the city of Bradford, UK
 bahut lambey samay tak in bacchon ke swasthya par adhyayan kiya gaya
 Among these children, 45 percent were of Pakistani origin and 40 percent were white British children

 yahaan ekmaatr makasad he-doctor bananaa
 One such hangout for those who are quietly working is the hallway in the main block of the hospital
 yahaan ke daravaaje par lagi pattee par likhaa he, ‘‘gros anatomi lab
 "there is plenty of light inside and gleaming cleanliness, lab implements made of stainless steel are shining, human body parts in round jars are floating in a dark yellow slurry, skeletons hung under fluorescent lights and white sheets
 Some corpses are lying below
 safed kot pahane chaatr in akade nile shariron ko tukade-tukade main kaat dete hai
 They are learning to treat people alive by experimenting on the dead
 yahaan kaa yahi dastur he
 Only after passing this, the medical students move on the path of becoming a doctor
 kuch log hairaan hote honge ki aakhir ames har saal india today-nilsan best colejes survey main awwal number par kaise aa jaataa he
 It is necessary to peek into the lab to know its clue
 ames main anatomi yani sharir rachana vibhaag ke adhyaksh doctor tii
 s
 roy bataate hai, ‘‘anatomi lab, medicine kii buniyaad he
 "it is here that future physicians learn to recognize the body parts of a living human, and future surgeons also learn to make the first incision here
 roy kehete hai, ‘‘medical skool kaa yah hissaa har doctor ko yaad rahata he or ames ke chaatro ke liye to ise apane jehan main basaane ke liye anginat kaaran maujuud hote hai
 He smiled first when asked by Ayush, an MBBS first-year student, about his experience in the lab
 phir usne apane saamne pade shav kii mansapeshiyon ke kinare tak pahunchane ke liye khaal or charbi main chaaku ghusaate hue kaha, ‘‘mere kai dost duusare medical collejon main pard rahe hai, lekin unhen murdon par itnaa vakt bitaane kaa mauka nahin miltaa jitna ki hamen miltaa he
 Junior residents make incisions and they keep looking, but here we have to do this work the whole time
 ’’ aayush kii baat bilkul sahi he
 MBBS students in India are required to spend maximum hours on anatomy
 lekin isamen bhi ek gambhir pareshaani he
 By 1997, the Medical Council of India (MCI) had mandated 915 hours, but AIIMS has never been under MCI and has always adopted the best practices
 1977 main hi ames ne anatomi par lagane vaale kul samay ko 840 se ghataakar 541 ghante kar diya
 The experiment was so successful that MCI reduced the hours of anatomy to 650 in other medical colleges in 1997 as well
 ames main anatomi ke assistant professor doctor tony jaikab bataate hai, ‘‘lekin duusare medical collejon main sthiti akasar aisi nahin hoti jaisi ames main hoti he
 At AIIMS, the ratio of teacher to student is 1: 8
 baaki puure vakt yah kul 1:1
 There are 2
 iskaa phayda yah he ki lacture theatre main kam or disection haul main zyada samay bitta he
 "according to Jacob, in most medical colleges, in most anatomies, the ratio is 1 to 30 or so due to a shortage of teachers
" Most of his 650 hours go to theory and lecture
 ’’isaki vajah se ames ke chaatr anatomi main kam samay lagane ke baavjood uske bare main behatar pratyaksh jaankaree paa lete hai
 Faculty Dr
 at AIIMS renu dhingra ke anusaar, ‘‘baat sirf itani nahin he
 "because of the high student-teacher ratio, we can adopt modern methods of teaching in small groups through dialogue," she says
 ’’ dow
 According to Dhingra, the syllabus is designed based on problems encountered during clinical experience
 anatomi lab main har satr main ultrascope jaise kisi nae tul kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Ultrascope is a video-driven guidance system that allows peeping within the body
 emarai, siti , eks-re or ultrasonogram ke jariye sharir ke tantra ko samajha jaataa he or cheerfaad ke baad unhen dekhakar matlab nikaala jaataa he
 Compared to the proportion in which the number of medical students is increasing, sufficient bodies are not available for dissection
 yah kami bharat main gambhir sankat kaa rup leti ja rahi he
 In 1947, out of 23 medical colleges in the country, about 1,000 students went on to become doctors
 lekin aaj kareeb 335 collejon se har saal 43,890 chaatr padhakar nikalate hai or unamem se 24,005 chaatr 184 nijee collejon se aate hai
 According to a 2012 research by the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research, 64 percent of colleges do not have enough bodies to teach anatomy, while MCI rules out that the student-body ratio should be 10: 1

 By the way, if you want to enjoy cycle rickshaw then go to India and Bangladesh more than India
 America 's cars, remains amorphous

 Taking an aggressive stance, he said that the top leadership of the BJP conspired in the entire incident
 bijepi ne kejariwal kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi he
 This is the fourth attack on CM Kejriwal, but the charge sheet has not been filed yet on the earlier attack
 police bijepi kii lathait wing ban gai he
 Making fun of the interrogation with Anil Sharma, Sisodia said that bjp's attacker (anil Sharma) is brother to the police, son? The police take action against the Aam Aadmi Party and give tea to the BJP people
 ye poochtacha ho rahi he yaa hamalavar kii aarti utaari ja rahi he
 If you have the right, show them by working
 bijepi kii gunda sena mat bano

 padmavati ko lekar nervas hai?main kaaphi nervas hum
 i can't remember the last time i was so nervous
 ab tak maine jitani bhi filmein kii hai unamem se is film main kuch alag baat he
 This film is not made with heart or mind but with whole mind
 ham sabake liye yah ek bhaavnaatmak safar rahaa
 Who was the more challenging character of Bajirao Mastani's Mastani and Padmavati? Mastani's character was also associated with history and she was a warrior princess
 lekin padmavati kii ladaai bahut alag thi, ve yuddh ke maidan par jaakar nahin ladati thim, koi kavach yaa talwaar kaa istemaal nahin karti thim
 Despite this, they both have great similarity in courage, purity, values and intensity
 padmavati main bina kisi tuls ke apni parampara, apane sammaan or pyaar ko sirf acting ke jariye pesh karnaa mere liye behad chunauteepurn rahaa
 What would you say to the questions that are being raised about Padmavati's look? Some people have questioned Padmavati's look in this film that her Bhawen is linked, Skintone is also different
 lekin jab aap film dekhenge to aap paaenge ki padmavati kii sirf shaareerik khubsuurati hi nahin thi, balki unki aantarik khubsuurati zyada myne rakhti thi
 They are very inspiring to me
 yah bhi sach he ki hamaare desh main mahilaon kii khubsuurati kaa ek alag paimaana he
 But the beauty of Padmavati was much larger than the physical realm
 padmavati ko lekar lagaataar virodh ho rahaa he?itani adchanon ke baavjood film kaa pramotion or trailor launch karte hue mujhe lag rahaa he ki koi to he jo har kadam par hamaari madad kar rahaa he
 i feel Padmavati around me, i am living them
 garba, laavni ke baad ab aap lokanrity ghumar ko lekar charchaa main hai?sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath kaam karte samay aapako sirf vishwaas rakhana padataa he
 i tried to understand the essence of Ghoomar

 Muslim warriors AIMPLB and Jamiat face-to-face with Muslim parties on Ayodhya dispute - who is raising the expenses of lawyers who are lobbying the cost of Ayodhya's Babri masjid-ram temple dispute case is going on daily in the Supreme Court
 mana ja rahaa he ki faisla jald aa saktaa he
 However, before the verdict comes, two big Muslim organizations of the country are face to face
 ol india muslim personal lau board or moulana arshad madani kii jamiyat ulema-e-hind ke bich ayodhya maamle kaa credit lene kii hode much gai he
 There has been a continuous effort from Jamiat ulema-e-hind to explain that the entire cost of the case is being spent by Maulana Arshad Madni
 ye baat alag he ki ayodhya maamle main muslim pakshakaron ke sabase bade vakil rajeev dhawan ek bhi paisa fees nahin rahe hai
 The Muslim Personal Law Board says that the rest of the lawyers are being paid fees from checks
 muslim personal lau board ke pravaktaa syed kasim rasul eliyas kaa patr soshal media main khub viral ho rahaa he
 The letter said that Maulana Arshad Madni and his people are trying to hijack the Ayodhya case through some Urdu newspapers
 iske liye wo acha khaasaa paisa bhi kharch kar rahe hai
 Maulana Arshad Madani, president of Jamiat ulema-e-hind, had met Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat recently
 sangh pramukh se mulaakaat ke duusare din muslim personal lau board ne moulana arshad madani kaa naam liye bagaiyr bada hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki aise shaatir logon se muslim samudaay ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 After this it became clear that the relationship between Jamiat and the board did not improve
 jamiyat ke legal cell ke adhyaksh gulzaar azmi ne aajtak
 in told that no other Muslim organization is giving all the money to the lawyers from Ayodhya case to the photo state, except Jamiat
 ayodhya maamle ke vakil ejaj makabool kii fees jamiyat detii he
 He said that Jamiat ulema-e-hind first went to court regarding the Babri Masjid case
 gulzaar azmi ne kaha ki muslim personal lau board is maamle main kahin nahin he
 During the hearing, go and see how many lawyers come from the board
 muslim personal lau board par bada aarope lagaate hue gulzaar azmi ne kaha ki babari masjid ke naam par board ne muslim samudaay se kaaphi chanda vasula he
 In such a situation, he is restless to take credit in this matter
 isiilie jamiyat ko lekar nishaanaa saadh rahaa he
 He said that there are many people on the board who support the BJP
 vahiin, muslim personal lau board ke ek sadsy ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki ayodhya maamle ko board bahut sanjidagi ke saath lard rahaa he
 Whatever the expenses are being incurred in this case, the board is doing it by check, which has a complete record
 haalanki unhone ye bhi kaha ki jamiyat ulema-e-hind ne vakil raju ramchandran ko jarur kuch peshi par fees di he
 But the rest of Dushyant Dave, Shekhar Nafade and Meenakshi Arora are being funded by the Muslim Personal Law Board
 ayodhya maamle main apilkarta moulana mehfujurrahman ke namit khalik ahamed khan ne aajtak
 told that Jamiat ulama-e-hind is a party in this matter, but the Muslim Personal Law Board is looking after the whole matter
 board bahut hi ranneeti or plan ke saath is mukademe kii pairvi kar rahaa he
 The expenditure that is being incurred in this case is not the money of any one man but the people of the Muslim community
 aise main koi agar daawa karata he to vah galat he
 Explain that a total of 14 appeals have been filed in the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya case
 inamen se 6 yachikaayen hinduon kii taraf se hai or 8 muslim pakshakaron kii taraf se hai
 In 2010, after the Lucknow bench of the Uttar Pradesh High Court decided in Ayodhya, the Muslim Personal Law Board had a strategy by meeting at the Taj Hotel in Delhi
 isi ke tahat muslim samudaay kii ore se 8 pakshakaron ne supreme court main yachika daayar kii
 Muslim parties include the Central Sunni Waqf Board, Jamiat ulema-e-hind (hamid Mohammed Siddiqui), Iqbal Ansari, Maulana Mahmudurrahman, Missbahuddin, Maulana Mahfuzurrahman Miftahi and Maulana Asad Rashidi
 muslim personal lau board is maamle main sidhe taur par shaamil nahin he, lekin puraa maamla usee kii nigaraanee main chal rahaa he
 Khalik Ahmed Khan said that the Muslim Personal Law Board under the leadership of Yusuf Hatim Muchhala, senior advocate for the Ayodhya case, has maintained a legal cell of legal experts
 legal cell ke dwaara banaai gai ranneeti ko muslim pakshakaar ke vakil supreme court main rakhte hai
 The Muslim Personal Law Board is working for this

 mujffarnagar dange ke ahm gavaah asabaab kii saream goliyon se bhunkar hatya kar di gai
 But the hands of the police are still empty in this case
 somvaar ko jile ke khatauli kasbe main doodh kaarobaari ko agyaat badmaashon ne nishaanaa banaaya tha
 In this case, the great negligence of the police is also coming out
 mritak ke do bhai 2013 main dange kii bhent chadh gaye the
 Upholstery was also a plaintiff in his murder case and also an important witness
 beete somvaar yani 11 march ko doodh kaarobaari asabaab ko khatauli kasbe main agyaat badmaashon goliyon se bhun daalaa tha
 Two Upholstery brothers were also murdered in the 2013 rioting riots
 uske donon bhaaiyon kii hatya kaa maamla court main vichaaradhin he
 The case was to be heard on 25 March
 ab is maamle ko lekar police par sawalia nishaan uth rahe hai
 The deceased had also demanded protection from the police several times
 lekin yogi kii police is maamle main laaparvaahee dikhaai
 Now the police are claiming that the upholstery murder case will be revealed soon
 vaardaat ke din yani beeti 11 march kii shaam ko asabaab doodh supplai karne khatauli ja rahaa tha
 At that time, some miscreants riding the bike stopped firing on him on the way
 hamale main use kai goli lagi thi
 Due to which he died on the spot
 ghatana ko anjaam dene ke baad agyaat bike savaar badmaash maukey se faraar ho gaye the
 Surprisingly, live pictures of the upholstery massacre were captured on CCTV cameras
 jise police ne apane kabje main lekar jaanch padtaal kii he
 But the police refused to give footage of the incident to the media
 is hatyakand ko 2 din biit chuke hai
 So far, the police has neither got any clue nor the police has reached any end
 haalanki mritak asabaab ke parijanon ne saaf kar diya he ki 2013 dange main uske do bhaiyon kii hatya kii gai thi
 Upholstery deceased was the plaintiff and witness in the case
 is maamle ko lekar kuch log or aaropee pehle bhi un par faisle kaa dabaav bana rahe the
 Upholstery advocates say upholstery was in danger of life
 usne vakil ke madhyam se apni hatya kii ashanka jataate hue police adhikariyon ko bhi ek patr diya tha
 Now SSP Sudhir Kumar has formed several police teams in connection with this entire case
 sisitivi footage ke aadhaar par bhi aropiyon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Now the top officials have claimed to disclose the matter soon
 ahm maamle ke vaadi or gavaah asabaab kii shikaayat ke baad bhi use suraksha naa die janaa police kii laaparvaahee ko ujagar karata he
 It is clear that after his murder, now his brothers and his killers are seen escaping from the hands of law
 saath hi police kii naakaami bhi saaf najar aa rahi he
 Soft-spoken Sumitra Mahajan, an eight-time BJP MP, is fondly called Tai, the elder sister

 Interestingly, 71-year-old Sumitra Mahajan, the senior-most MP among women mps, is officially listed as Sumitra Mahajan Tai in the list of mps of the 16th Lok Sabha
 mira kumaar ke baad mahajan loksabhaadhyaksh banane vaali duusari mahila hai
 Mahajan, who started political life at the age of 39, became the deputy mayor and after that he was elected MP from Indore Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh
 varsh 1999 se 2004 ke bich vah atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main rajya mantri raheen tathaa maanav sansaadhan, sanchaar evam praudyogiki tathaa petroleum evam prakritik gas jaise vibhinn mantralayon kaa prabhaar sambhala

 Mahajan, who made his political debut in 1982 as a councilor in the Indore Municipal Corporation, entered Parliament for the first time by defeating Congress veteran and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Prakashchand Sethi in 1989 by over one lakh votes
 yah poochne par ki kya unhen itani lambii pari khilne kaa yakeen tha, unhone kaha ki yah sochakar vah raajnneeti main nahin ai thi
 Mahajan, who comes from a non-political background, said that the journey had not really started at that time thinking that i had to do something
 party ne meri or mere kaary kii pahchaan janata se karai
 At that time, Kushabhau Thackeray (former BJP president) had ordered that the election was to be fought and i obeyed him and started the work
 meri koi raajnneetik mahatvakanksha nahin thi
 Asked about the changes in BJP in this year, he said that today the party is getting the fruits of the hard work of the old people
 unhone kaha, bhaajapa ke puraane netaaon ne jo mehnat kii he, vah aaj rang laa rahi he
 He has done the plowing, sowing of the field so much that the crop he is seeing today is his work
 ham uski raksha kar rahe hai or kaise zyada fasal aati jaye, yah dekh rahe hai
 He said, the good thing is that the bjp's organization is still strong and it is spreading across the country

 Health Department officials in California have made a big disclosure about the adult film industry
 vibhaag ne haal hi ekedlt starake HIV peedit hone kii pushti kii he
 Not only this, the department claims that after one actor it has started spreading to other actors as well
 vibhaag kaa kahana he ki aisa film shooting se itar baahar bhi asurakshit sex karne ke kaaran hua he
 The Health Department said, 'we have found that Adult Star used to have unprotected sex with another male actor
 is kaaran unhen echivi positive paaya gaya he
 The film comes from having sex outside of the shoot, as nothing was found in the investigation during the first shoot recently
 lekin duusare shoot ke baad actors ko HIV peedit paaya gaya
 The investigation also revealed that other actors have also got HIV infection
 bataaya jaataa he ki shuruaati jaanch main infections nahin hone ke kaaran film kii shooting kii gai, lekin baad main yah ek actor se duusare or phir tisare main failati gai
 The porn industry has refused to comment on this
 vibhaag is baat kaa khulaasa nahin kar rahaa he ki koun-si production company ke actor aids peedit hai
 But it is learned that the infection occurred in Nevada
 pehle bhi hoti rahi hai aisi batelos angelis sthit aids healthcare foundation ke adhyaksh mishael vensten ne bataaya ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he
 This happens in the porn industry

 Those involved in film production believe that doing so offends viewers
 foundation ne 2012 main los angelis country voters kii ore se pornographic film stars ke liye condom istemaal ko lekar ordinance par kaam bhi kiya tha
 But the industry strongly opposed this ordinance
 edlt star har do hafte main yon sambandhi medical jaanch karavaate rahete hai
 Although mehndi is used throughout the year in the grooming of women, but the color of mehndi in Saavn becomes somewhat different
 mahilaayein sawan main apane jeevanasathi ke naam se haathon main mehandi rachaati hai, taaki daampaty jivan main pyaar badhata rahe
 When there is a greenery empire in the spring, Indian women also use green color in their dress
 shringaar kii baat mehandi ke bina adhuri hi rah jaati he
 Anyway, Mehndi has its own importance in Sawan
 manyata he ki jisaki mehandi jitani rang laati he, usko utana hi apane pati or sasuraal kaa prem miltaa he
 Sondhi fragrance of mehndi not only makes the girl's home-courtyard beautiful, but also adds beauty to the girl's beauty
 isliye kaha bhi jaataa he ki mehandi ke bina dulhan adhuri hoti he
 It is often seen that the bangles of the women turn green as soon as they get into the spring, and their dress also turns green
 sawan main menhadi kii choti-badi har dukaan ladakiyon or mahilaon se pate rahete hai
 All designs except silver mehndi, golden mehndi, brown mehndi are made from real mehndi and its color also lasts for a long time, while silver, golden and brown mehndi are of glitter which people often apply before going to the ceremony and water
 Cleans completely after washing with
 in dinon mehandi fishan kii vastu ban gai he jis kaaran maang bhi bad gai he
 It has even been claimed that mehndi not only affects hormones, they also control blood circulation
 mehandi dimag ko shant or tej bhi banaata he
 After all, mehndi is an object of decoration, then women are not able to stay away from it in the spring

 patna main karpuri jayanti ke maukey par pahunche amit shah ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon se agle vidhanchunaav main akele 185 siten dilaane or bijepi sarkaar banane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Shah made it clear at a rally in Patna that the chief minister would belong to the BJP because the previous experience of making Nitish Kumar the chief minister and the loss of considering him as elder brother, the party had to repay by losing the government
 bihar main bijepi kaa chunavi 'shankhanaad'shah ne kaha ki unki party ne nitish kumaar kii mukhyamantri banane kii ichha kaa sammaan kiya tha lekin wo anhakaar main bijepi kii takat ko bhul gaye or gathbandhan tod diya
 There is still 10 months left in the Bihar Legislative Election, but Shah shattered the election in Bihar on the pretext of Karpoori Jayanti and brought the party into electoral mode
 bihar main shah ke nishane par sidhe-sidhe nitish kumaar rahe
 He accused Nitish Kumar of breaking ties with the BJP in egoism and ambition for the post of Prime Minister
 nitish ne ghonpa bijepi kii peeth main chhurashaah ne kaha ki bihar ke purv siem ne apane ahankaar main bijepi ke peeth main chura ghonpakar logon ke saath vishwasghaat kiya or jab janata ne nitish ko loksabhaa chunaav main unki haisiyat bataa di tab wo usee lalu ke saath ja mili jiske khilaaf unka puraa raajnneetik jivan rahaa he
 Shah said that Karpoori's dreams were fulfilled by BJP as BJP made Narendra Modi a backward class man
 lalu or nitish par shah ne bolaa hamalaapane kaaryakartaaon kii bheed se utsahit shah ne nitish or lalu par jamkar hamalaa bolaa unhone kaha jis lalu ke jangalraj ke khilaaf ladakar nitish kumaar yahaan tak pahunche, usee ke saath milakar bihar kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, lekin bijepi ye nahin hone degi na to laluraj or na hi jangalraj lautega
 Amit Shah said that because of Nitish's arrogance, Bihar cannot be handed over to Jungle Raj and Lalu Yadav, therefore this government will be uprooted in the coming elections
 shah ne kaha sarkaar badalakar modi ke vikaas ko bihar tak pahunchaayenge
 He also promised to take Bihar out of the category of 'bimaru States' and give 24-hour power to the entire state if he gets power
 shah do din ke bihar ke daure par hai
 There is a meeting of party workers on Friday and on Saturday Shah Shah will go to Karpoori Thakur Museum and visit Jayaprakash Narayan's house, pay tribute to JP

 Pravin Jha, chairman of Jawaharlal Nehru University's Center for Economic Studies and Planning, believes that the Prime Minister should have said these words to the protesting students of JNU

 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko pradaan suraksha main baari katautee kii he
 Lalu Yadav was given security of z + category by the Union Home Ministry, which has now been reduced to z category, in view of the danger on him
 lalu ko di gai NSG suraksha bhi tatkaal prabhaav se waapas le lee gai he
 Significantly, a leader of z category security cannot get additional security of NSG
 isi prakaar centre sarkaar nepurv mukhyamantrijithan ram maanjhi ko mili Z+ category kii suraksha khatm kar di he
 This means that Manjhi will no longer be provided with any category security
 Z+ category ke tahat jithan ram maanjhi ko jo CRPF kii suraksha mili hui thi vah waapas lene kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 On 23 November, the central government decided to reduce the security of Lalu and Jeetan Ram Manjhi, and this information has been given to the top officials of Bihar Police
 sutron ke mutabik lalu ko z category suraksha ke tahat atirikt CRPF ki suraksha mil sakati he, lekin is par ab tak koi faisla nahin liya gaya he
 However, this new directive from the central government has had the most impact on Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 kyonki unke paas ab kisi bhi category kii suraksha nahin he or unhen apni suraksha ke liye sirfabihar policepar hi bharosa karnaa padegaa
 It is worth noting that Jitan Ram Manjhi is an MLA from Imamganj, Naxalite affected assembly in Gaya district
 isi vajah se unhen Z+ category kii suraksha mili hui thi
 According to sources, Lalu has shown strong attitude against the central government for some time and strongly opposed Prime Minister Modi
 isi vajah se unhen bhi is baat kii aahat jarurat thi ki centre sarkaar unki suraksha main kami kar saktaa he
 Not only the Islamic world, but also the people of America are shocked by the sudden rise of Muslim love against US President Donald Trump, who spewed venom against Muslims
 kisi ne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki trump is kadar badal jaaenge
 Experts, however, are skeptical of Trump's alleged change
 unka kahana he ki trump ke muslim prem ke peeche swaarth chipa hua he
 They are misleading the world by expressing Muslim love, in contrast to their stand to save their power and divert the attention of the people from the Russia dispute
 america media kaa kahana he ciamerica raashtrapati chunaav memrus ke dakhal kii jaanch kar rahe james komi ko FBI diarector pad se hataakar or roosi videsh mantri sargei lavaro ko ahm khufia jaankaree dekar trump buree tarah funs chuke hai
 He has gone on a foreign tour only to avoid questions
 duniya ke chah muslim deshon ke nagarikon ke america main pravesh par pratibandh lagane vaale donald trump ke paas muslim netaaon ko saadhane ke sivaay koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 Attempts to reconcile with Muslim customs as well
 The American President not only started his first foreign tour from the Muslim country of Saudi Arabia, but also tried his best to get along with Muslim customs by reaching there
 unke saath unki beti or patni bhi gai hui hai
 Addressing the first 'arab-islamic American Summit' on Sunday, Trump said that the fight against terrorism is not a fight against any religion, but a fight between good and evil
 unhone kaha ki muslim deshon ko islamic kattarpanth ke khilaaf ekajute hokar ladanaa chahie
 Leaders of 55 Muslim countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh attended the summit
 ek jatke main tasviir badalane kii khwahishtrump kii ore se muslim deshon ke america main pravesh par pratibandh lagane, syria par hamale karne or afghanistan main sabase bada gaiyr parmaanu bam giraane se muslim rashtron main jabardast aakrosh tha, jisko khatm karne liye trump ne saudi main 'arab islamic america summit' manch kaa istemaal kiya
 He was shown sympathy towards Muslims in his speech
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki trump ne apni muslim virdohi chhavi ko ek jatke main badalane ke liye shandaar koshish kii
 They are also seen beating their predecessors in this matter
 vaise bhi trump kisi bhi kaam ko ek jatke main karne main vishwaas karte hai
 Trump won a resounding victory in the US presidential election without experience and then took swift decisions against Muslims
 pehali videsh yatra ko safal banane kii kathin parikshatrump ke america se ravaanaa hone ke baad se yah sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai ki kya vah apane pehle videshi daure ko safal bana paaenge? vah lagaataar america media ke nishane par hai
 In such a situation, if the US President is successful, then surely he will get some relief from disputes on reaching America
 varna waapas lautne par unako apane pad ko bachaae rakhane kii chunauti se bhi jujhna hoga
 Usually, the US President elects neighboring countries like Canada or Mexico for his first foreign tour, but Trump has taken the decision
 america media main yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki trump teen dharmon kii tirthayatra main ja rahe hai
 The question is whether these pilgrimages will reduce their problems

 a committee has been proposed to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation that it is mandatory for all restaurants, hotels and meat vendors selling meats to write on the board whether the meat is 'halal' or 'jerk'
 unka kahana he ki halaal meet se hindu or sikhon kii bhavanaaen aahat hoti hai, isi ko lekar purvi dilli nagar nigam kii standing cameti ne ek nae prastaav ko manjuuri di he
 Under this, now all the hotels and restaurants in the East Delhi area will need to tell in their display board whether the meat they are giving is halal or jerk or both
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke is prastaav ko standing cameti ne paas kar diya he
 Now it will be passed in the House, after which this rule will come into force
 purvi dilli kii standing cameti ke chairman satyapal singh ne kaha ki standing cameti kii baithak main bijepi ke parshad nesujhav diyatha ki halaal or jhatka meet ko disple karne kaa prastaav ko manjuuri mili kyonki hindu or sikh samaaj ke log halaal meet ko nahin khate
 But in the display board of hotels and restaurants, only the meat is mentioned, so that it is not known whether it is halal meat or a jerk, which hurts the sentiments of the people of Hindu and Sikh society, so the order to put it in the display board Give East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 cricketron kaa koi charitra nahin hota, cricketer sabase budtameez hote hai
 It is alleged by the girl who had the responsibility to cheer the cricketers
 bloging ke jariye cricketron kii nijee jaankaree bahari duniya ko li karne ke iljaam main tii-20 se nikaali gai dakshin africa kii chirgirl gaberiyla ne cricketron or tii-20 ke party culture ko lekar kai sansanikhej khulaase kiye hai
 The relationship between cricket and glamor is old but now the dark truth of this dazzle is coming out which has left cricketers in the dock
 dakshin africa kii ek chirgirl gabariela ne cricketron par partiyon ke dauraan ashleel harakat karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Gabriella Un 40 The
 africa chirgirls main se ek thi jo tii-20 sijan 4 main ai to thi jalawaa bikherne, lekin ek blog main sach likhnaa itnaa mahangaa padaa ki unhen bich toornament se hi waapas bhej diya gaya
 If Gabriella is to be believed, she was sent back only after the players complained
 gabariela ne kaha he ki pichley mangalvaar mujhe waapas bhej diya gaya jaise ki main koi apradhi hum, mujhase is tarah baat kii gai jaise maine drugs lee ho yaa phir koi badi galati kii ho, meri baat rakhane kaa bhi mujhe mauka nahin diya gaya
 According to Gabriella, cheerleaders are advised to stay away from cricketers when they reach India, but most of the cheerleaders are close to the cricketers
 usne apane blog main likhaa he ki ye ek bhadda mazaaq he, sab jagah camere rahete hai or har koi dekh saktaa he ki in partiyon main cricktaron kaa ravaiya kya hota he
 They consider us meat
 yakeenan cricketron ke bare main gaberiyla kii ye raay unke phans ko hilaa sakati hai, jo cricketron ko deewangi kii had tak chaahate hai
 Taking the blame for Cheergirl Gabriela said that i felt that cricketers have no character and that cricketers are more insolent than other sports
 hairaani hoti he ki ladakiyon ko lekar cricketron or aam aadmi kii soch main koi fark nahin he or maine khud se kaha ki cricketron se saavdhaan
 This dark truth of the cricketing world is embarrassing and at the same time the question arises that every time the BCCI promises a ban on post-match parties but it is not implemented
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye he ki kya bhartiya cricket control board is baar bhi chuppi saadh legaa yaa phir koi karrwai bhi karegaa
 It seems that the fear of the law has ended from the heart of UP crooks
 elahabadke ek durga pandal main chaar badmaashon ne din dahaade tabadatod goliyaan dagkar ek historishiter niraj balmiki kaa murder kar diya
 After the firing, the pandal stirred everywhere

 The white-shirted man with whom he is shaking hands is a history sheeter and chairman of the Durga Puja Committee, Neeraj Valmiki

 Some things happen
 phir niraj use baithne kaa ishaara karata he
 The attacker turns on the pretext of sitting on the chair
 furti se pistal nikaalkar niraj par goli chalaane lagata he
 Neeraj tries to run away, but then the attacker's other partner also fires
 tab tak teesraa hamalavar bhi aa jaataa or itane main chauthaa shaks bam phenk detaa he
 On seeing the whole incident, it is clear that Neeraj Balmiki died in a bullet and bomb attack
 hamale main maare gaye niraj par pehle se darjanon mukademe hai
 He came out of jail only two months ago
 hamale main ek hamalavar bhi jakhmi ho gaya
 The attackers were captured in CCTV cameras but they are still away from police custody
 sansad ke nichle sadan yaniloksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaniyukt karne ke liye siton ke nunatam pratishat kii jarurat nahin he
 The Lok Sabha Secretariat has said so in response to an RTI
 haalanki, isse pehle loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne congress ko netaa pratipaksh kaa darja die jane kii maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 But, in two months of this decision, this reply has come from RTI
 mumbai ke artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali kii arji ke jawaab main loksabhaa sachivalay ke avar sachiv ke sona ne yah jaankaree di he
 He said, there is no minimum percentage provision for the selection of the Leader of Opposition
 galgali ne artiai ke jariye yah jaananaa chaha tha ki netaa pratipaksh kii niyukti ke liye siton kii anivaary nunatam sankhya kya honi chahie
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on July 7, demanding the status of the party's leader in the House, Malikarjun Kharge
 sumitra ne is patr ke jawaab main 14 agast ko kaha tha ki lagu hone vaale praavdhaanon evam purv kii paramparaon par vichaar karne ke baad unke anurodh ko sweekaar karnaa sambhav nahin he
 He said in a letter to Sonia that after considering the provisions of the relevant legislations and the directions of Lok Sabha Speaker (directions 120 and 121) and previous traditions, it was not found possible to accept your request
 in purv paramparaon kaa pichley kareeb 60 saal main kai baar paalan kiya gaya jo vigat ke kai prakhyat loksabhaa adhyakshon dwaara kiye gaye nirnyon par aadhaarit hai
 Later defending her decision, Sumitra said that her decision is based on rules and traditions
 unhone ek niyam kaa hawala diya tha, jisamen kisi party ke netaa ko vipaksh kaa netaa ghoshit karne ke liye uske paas sadan kii nunatam 10 pratishat siten honi chahie
 It is said that he said, i have decided after studying the rules and traditions and taking the opinion of experts on the issue
 kisi vipakshi party ke paas 55 se zyada (siten) nahin he
 Till date, the rule of having minimum 10 percent seats in the House (to be given the status of Leader of the Opposition) has not changed
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki 1980 evam 1984 main sadan main koi vipaksh kaa netaa nahin tha, kyonki kisi party ke paas apekshit sankhya nahin thi
 The Lok Sabha Secretariat has also informed the RTI activist that the post of Leader of Opposition in the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Lok Sabha remained vacant
 usne kaha ki sansthaanon evam aayogon ke pramukhon ke chayan ke liye vipaksh ke netaa kii jarurat sambandhi sawaal ko kanoon evam vidhi mantralay ke paas bheja gaya he
 (input from PTI) karnataka main congress or jedies ke bich gathbandhan ke baad siton kaa bantwaaraa hona abhi baaki he lekin mana ja rahaa he ki agle hafte is par antim faisla liya ja saktaa he
 According to information from Congress sources, the party can give JDS 8 out of 28 seats
 haalanki is par antim muhar congress varking cameti kii baithak ke baad hi lagegi
 The seat sharing between the two parties is likely to be announced on 16 March
 mysore jaisi ahm seat tabhi jedies ko di jaaegi jab echdi devgauda us seat se chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar hon
 The names of 2-2 contenders for each seat have been decided on Monday, the final decision on which is expected on March 16
 devgauda ke ladane par sanshayudhar, siton ke bantwaaron ko lekar jedies pramukh echdi devgauda ne somvaar ko kaha ki karnataka main gathbandhan sahyogi congress ke saath siton kaa bantwaaraa 13-14 march tak puraa ho jane kii sambhaavna he
 From which seat will Deve Gowda contest? In response to this question, the former Prime Minister made it clear that he has not reached any decision yet
 devgauda ne kaha, ‘aaj, zyaadaatar varisht netaa dilli gayi honge
 Tomorrow after the discussion with them on the seat sharing, i will also have a discussion and it is possible that a final decision will be made soon
 ’unhone kaha ki siton ke bantwaare ke mudde par 13 yaa 14 march tak ek yaa do din main ham antim charan main pahunch jaayenge
 JDS wants ten seats Last week, the meeting between the Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Deve Gowda in Delhi on the seat sharing did not reach any conclusion
 haalanki apni party kii maang main kami laate hue devegoda ne congress se unki party ko 28 loksabhaa siton main se kam se kam 10 siten dene ko kaha tha
 JDS had earlier sought 12 seats
 sutron ke mutabik yah saaf he ki jedies ko hasan or mandya kii seat milanaa tay he
 Both these seats currently have their own mps
 shimoga seat ke bare main devegoda pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki purv vidhayak madhu bangarppa vahaan se ummidavaar hogin
 In such a situation, both parties need to decide the rest of their seats

 On the question of advising Team India, Kapil Dev said that i do not go to him without need
 agar vah chahenge to koi bhi senior khilaadi unhen salaah dene se manaa nahin karegaa
 But you will not get advice without asking
 bataa den, bhartiya cricket team ke captain viraat kohli ne kaha tha ki agar vah england main itihaas doharaate hai to vah oxford kii sadakon par shartles hokar ghumenge
 He had said, 'I don't think i will be alone

 We will all be seen on the streets without a shirt

 The audience also has similar expectations from Gabbar Is Back
 gabbar ij back ke produsar sanjay lila bhansaali kaa akshay ke kaam or staradam par bharosa dekhie ki wo ipel ke bich 1 may ko apni film relies kar rahe hai, jabaki zyaadaatar diarector-produsar apni badi film ipel ke bich main relies karne se darate hai
 For the first time, facing the camera, everyone knows how difficult it was for Akki
 kuch maheene pehle akshay se unke puraane dinon ke bare main baat hui thi
 Then he told that for the first time he was so nervous after facing the camera that he had a fever of 102 degrees
 pehali baar live sho karte hue bhi unki kuch aisi hi haalat thi
 Of course this star has now done more than 500 live shows, but Akki himself told that he was so scared that he was losing his sweat while doing the first live show with Sridevi in delhi
 jeene kaa andaaj niraliakshay kaa lifestil or routine bollywood ke zyaadaatar sitaron se bilkul alag he

 But i often meet at 5 am, give interviews

 He tells about his journey, 'when i came in the industry, i did not have a choice
 mujhe jo bhi kaam mila, maine kiya

 ek si grad film kii shooting kaa kissa yaad karte hue akshay ne bataaya, 'maine safed shart or genes pahani hui thi
 The song was a sequel, so the director wanted me to wear shirts of different colors like Orange, Green, Red, but the producers did not want to spend money on my shirt so they asked the cinematographer to use green gelat paper
 isse main puraa haraa dikhne laga
 Similarly, he used red and yellow Gillette papers
 ' si grad se yahaan tak kaa unka safar sach main kamaal kaa he, wo bhi tab jab industry main unka koi nahin tha
 There is no doubt that in the case of Akshay stardom, the Khans of Bollywood do not stand in front of the trio, but they maintain their dominance at the box office by settling for instant films and making a strong presence among the audience

 Radia continues to plot against Maran
 radia ne 23 may kii dopaher ke baad raja se kaha ki ve em
 K
 algiri ko bataaen ki maaran unke bare main juthi afvaahen failaa rahe hai
 May 23, 2009 at 2:29 pm Raja: What are you saying? Radia: They are saying that they have no problem with this
 lekin kisi-na-kisi ko algiri ko bataanaa chahie or yah kaam aapako karnaa chahie
 And tell them how Maran
 
 
 rajalmen unhen pehle hi bataa chukaa hum
 Radia: You told them what they told the Congress leaders in Delhi
 rajathamujhe maaloom he, lekin congress ke jehan main yah kisne daalaa ki algiri angreji nahin jaanate?radiyahyahi nahin balki kal ve (maaran) or stallin hi party chalaane vaale honge kyonki boodha khabti ho gaya he or ab vah zyada samay tak nahin bachegaa or lihaaja congress unheen ke saath sambandh rakhana pasand karegi kyonki antat vahi (maaran) rahenge, or ve stallin ko niyantrit karte hai
 He only said this
 or yah ki algiri ek apradhi hai
 And also that they have not read more than the fifth Kahana
 radia ne 24 may ko raja ko bataaya ki karunanidhi ne mantrimandal main unke naam ko manjuuri de di he
 May 24, 2009; 11:05 am Radia: Hai, Mr
 Raja
 nira hum
 
 
 King: Tell Neera
 radiamaine aapako ek esemes bheja he or main kani se baat karti rahi hum
 So, basically they are talking that you should be there
 leader saamaanya rup se yah kah rahe hai ki dalit hone kii vajah se aapako hi vahaan (mantrimandal main) hona chahie or baaki aap jaanate hi hai
 Dravidian Party and all those things
 
 
 leader, agar sab unheen par chhod diya jaataa to ve pehle party se baat karte
 It is unfortunate that the family is coming in
 cho ramswami ne badhiya tippanee kii he, ki ise itane tak hi simit hona chahie
 i am talking to Kani, she said that someone is independent
 
 
 ve swatantra prabhaar nahin de rahe hai
 Raja: My case is cleared? Radia: Yes, your case is cleared
 aapkaa maamla kal raat hi saaf ho gaya tha
 No, but what is happening with Daya? Raja: Kapada or fertilizer? Radia: But not for Daya but Alagiri or Daya, only one can come? Raja: No, two can come
 
 
 nirah donon?rajakhbalu dikkat khadi karenge
 
 
 i think so
 radiyamujhe lagata he ki leader ke liye parivaar ke teen sadasyon ko uchit tehraana mushkil hoga
 Raja: (laughs) But everyone knows
 
 
 radiyanhin, kani ne yah kal raat hi mujhe bataaya-ki pita ji ne parason unase kya kaha, ki unke liye parivaar ke teen logon ko uchit tehraana mushkil hoga
 They (karunanidhi) understand this problem
 rajaltum kya kar sakati ho? dekhte hai
 
 
 we fight
 baatcheet ke aakhir main raja apni chintaa ke bare main radia ko bataate hai ki maaran unke daagdar ateet (2ji ghotaale) maamle par media main abhiyaan ched sakate hai
 And the king then asks Radia to warn Sunil Mittal against favoring Maran
 radialagiri, kya unhen maaloom he ki maaran unke bare main kya kuch kah rahe hai?rajatihaan, unhen maaloom he, yah baat algiri ko maaloom he
 But actually they cannot talk to their father
 vakt aane par ve baat karenge
 The only thing is that Maran will start his campaign against me
 iskaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Radia: We have to face the struggle differently
 rajavve hnnes ko bataa sakate hai ki ek baar phir daagdar mantri, spectrum
 
 
 , All such things
 radiyanhin, nahin, chintaa mat kiijie
 We'll check it out
 hamen kaaphi nakaaratmak baaten jhelni hai, yahaan tak ki congress ko bhi vah bayaan dena padaa tha na
 So, i talked to Sunil Mittal
 kya chandoliya ne aapako bataaya?rajasenhin, mujhe nahin maaloom
 Radia: i told him not to stop all this
 
 
 maine unase kaha ki yah thik nahin he
 Raja: Tell Sunil Mittal that you will have to work with the king for five more years, so that he does not get entangled with me
 radiamaine yah unase bataa diya, maine unase bataa diya, lekin phir aapako bhi anil se duuri banani hogi na
