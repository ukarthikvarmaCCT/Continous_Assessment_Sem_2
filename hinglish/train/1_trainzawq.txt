 bharat ke ek sevanivrutt mukhya nyaayadhish apane bedaag kapadon ke liye mashhoor hai
 At a recent social event, he arrived in a flashy white art silk jacket

 i said, sir, got stained

 supreme court ke liye 2018 to ab tak bhayaavah rahaa he
 The year began with a press conference addressed by four judges who are part of the collegium that currently makes judicial appointments and transfers, along with the Chief Justice
 kai anya aaropon ke saath jajon ne ye aarope lagaae ki adaalaton ke kaamkaaj main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa or samvedansheel maamle suvidha ke mutabik kuch khaas benchon ko die ja rahe hai, jinke purv sambandhon ke aadhaar par faisle ho rahe hai
 To resolve this dissatisfaction, the Chief Justice was demanded to have a system of judges making rosters on a subject basis, to ensure that the cases were listed on the basis of the subject matter of the case and not on the basis of arbitrary principle
 On
 lekin ek or aadesh ke jariye yah bhi nirnay liya gaya ki mukhya nyaayadhish hi roster ke pramukh hai or ve chahen to kisi kisi khaas jaj ko koi maamla saunp sakate hai
 The Supreme Court was hearing important cases like Aadhaar and Ayodhya, in the meantime 60 mps challenged the post of Chief Justice by bringing a motion for impeachment and removal of them
 is prastaav ko bharat ke up-raashtrapati ne bina kisi jaanch ke khaarij kar diya
 To dismiss the motion, MP Pratap S
 in the Supreme Court
 bajva or ami ech
 Yagnik challenged by filing a petition
 is par ek sawaal uthaa: aisi yachika kii sunwaayee ke liye upyukt peeth kya honi chahie, khaskar yah dekhte hue ki mukhya nyaayadhish or collegium ke anya jajon ko to sambhavat: iske liye upyukt nahin mana ja saktaa?supreme court main aam chalan yah he ki sabhi yachikaayen sunwaayee ke liye do yaa teen jajon kii khandpeeth ke saamne aati hai, jo ki ise paanch jajon ke vyapak sanvaidhanik peeth ke paas bhej dete hai
 But a petition is moved only when, through an open court hearing, they decide that a concrete question of constitutional law is to be decided in the case
 haalanki bajva or yagnik kii yachika ko sidhe collegium ke baahar ke paanch sabase varisht jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ke saamne bhej diya gaya
 The immediate listing of the case and details about the bench were revealed on the last night of the day of hearing on May 8, 2018, when the Cause list (ie the next day's list of works) was uploaded on the Supreme Court website
 bajva kii taraf se pesh hone vaale vakil kapil sibbal ne poocha ki yah maamla sidhe sanvaidhanik bench ke saamne kaise aayaa or agar bench ko ek prashasnic aadesh ke tahat gathit kiya gaya he, to ve is prashasnic aadesh ko dekhnaa chahenge
 The basis of their argument was that the Chief Justice could not pass an administrative order in any case in which he himself was involved
 lekin bench ne prashasnic aadesh kii copy dene se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad sibbal ne yah tay kiya ki ve mahabhiyog prastaav ko khaarij karne ke aadesh ko chunauti dene vaali yachika ko waapas lenge
 However, this big question still remains: can a presiding officer of the legislature commit feticide of that motion by rejecting the demand to initiate the process of impeachment motion against a judge? The current legal position is that against the Chief Justice The vice-president's decision not to pursue the impeachment motion has not met any challenge in the constitutional courts
 mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra is saal aktubar main ritair hone vaale hai, collegium ke anya chaar main se teen jaj bhi is saal ke ant main ritair ho jaaenge
 So for the rest of the year, the well-wishers of Indian democracy can expect that the reputation of the court will no longer bear any new stains and the old stains will not cling to it

 However, she continued to do hot yoga despite sexual harassment, because then she felt that if she left yoga in the middle, her life would be over
 lekin iske baad choudhary ne aage bhi kai baar uske saath jyaadati kii

 He said that hanging all the cases on rape is wrong
 ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki sabhi maamalon main rape par faansee dena puri tarah se galat he

 jama masjid ke paas tourist bas par firing karne vaale hamalaavaron ne rajdhani ke or chaar jagahon kii reki kii thi
 These include Old Delhi Railway Station
 khufia sutron ne yah khulaasa kiya he
 He says that the attackers reached the capital six days before Uttar Pradesh
 yahi nahin in logon ne 15 agast se pehle bhi in jagahon kii reki kii thi
 Their method of attack corresponds to the way the Indian Mujahideen do
 tourist bas police hamalaavaron kii talash main juty hui he
 Intelligence sources also said that the number of attackers near Jama Masjid was four
 do hamalaavaron ne firing kii, jabaki do ne wo car parking kii, jisamen dhamaake baad aag lag gai thi
 It is believed that the car was parked after the firing
 haalanki ab tak goli chalaakar bhaagane vaale do logon ke bare main ab tak koi suraag nahin mil sakaa he
 According to PTI, police has so far questioned 50 people in connection with the investigation
 lekin ab tak jaanchakartaaon ke haath aisa kuch bhi nahin aayaa he jo jama masjid firing kii gutthi sulajhaa sake
 Two attackers came riding on bikes in the busy Jama Masjid area of delhi and escaped indiscriminately firing on a tourist bus
 lekin, dilli police or enie ab tak un hamalaavaron kaa suraag tak nahin dhundh pai he
 Not only this, the three numbers of bike reported by the eye witnesses to the police also turned out to be wrong in the investigation
 police ko aasapaas ke ilaakon ke sisitivi footage mili hai, jisaki jaachan kii ja rahi hai lekin abhi tak koi suraag nahin mila he
 The Delhi Police says that the incident that took place in the Jama Masjid area is not similar to the terrorist attacks
 maaruti car se police ko jo timer mila, vah behad nichle darje kaa tha
 Such timers are used by local gangs only
 dilli police ke mutabik car main koi visphotak bhi nahin mila
 The Delhi Police may have termed the timer found in the car as minor, but the plot was horrific
 car ko transformar ke neeche rakhaa gaya tha
 There was a conspiracy to blast the car through the pressure cooker so that its impact could also cause a blast in the transformer
 agar aisa hota to jama masjid ilaake main bheedbhad ko dekhte hue nuksaan bahut zyada hota
 After this incident, America has advised its citizens to be vigilant and low profile
 is bich, jaanch main sabase bada sawaal yah he ki golibari or car main halke dhamaake ke saath aag kii vaardaat ke peeche kiskaa haath he? iske peeche koi aatankwaadi sanghathan he yaa phir koi asaamjik tatv? On the one hand, there is a continuous increase in crime against women across the country, on the other hand, on the crime of serious crimes like rape, the political parties are constantly showing shameful statements

 co / bm6ugtkcfh a public interest litigation has been filed in the Delhi High Court over the increasing incidents of snatching in Delhi and the weakening of the law
 court ne is yachika par sunwaayee karte hue dilli police or civik agenciyon ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 The PIL filed in the High Court states that criminals are roaming free due to the lack of strict laws in Delhi for snatching
 kanoon ke lachar hone kii vajah se pakade gaye apradhi aasaani se chhot jate hai, lihaaja snatching par sakht niyam hone chahie
 The Delhi High Court has taken the matter very seriously
 court ne police se poocha he ki snatching ko sangathit aparaadh kii shrenee main kyon nahin rakhaa jaataa he kya dilli police nirbhaya jaisi kisi vaardaat kaa intjaar kar rahi he, kya kisi badi vaardaat ke hone par hi badlaav karne ko police sochegi
 The court has said that the police should tell in ten days that there cannot be strict laws like snatching in Delhi like Haryana and Maharashtra
 yah yachika vakil prashanth manachanda ne daayar kii he jisamen unka daawa he ki rajdhani memlgataar snatching kii vaardatonmen ijapha ho rahaa he
 In the last five years, snatching incidents have increased by four hundred times even snatching incidents are increasing with foreign women

 In the cases of snatching, the police registers Section 356 of the IPC ie use of force by committing criminal offenses and 379 in robbery which only carries a punishment of up to three years
 jabaki haryana or maharashtra main snatching par kade niyam lagu hai
 In these states, this type of crime comes under sections 356A and 379A which provides for a punishment of up to 14 years
 yachika main maang kii gai he ki snatching ko dhara 392 lutpaat or anya gambhir dhaaraon main darj karnaa chahie
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) on Friday launched a scathing attack on the congress-jd (S) government in Karnataka, calling it a '20 percent commission government'
 modi ne uttar karnataka ke gangavati main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue congress-jades gathbandhan par bhrashtachar ke mudde par hamalaa bolte hue piem modi (PM Modi)kaha ki uskaa 'ekmaatr mishan kamishan he'
 He described the previous (siddaramaiah) government as '10 percent commission government' but said that now with the joining of Congress and JDS, it has become '20 percent commission government'
 raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi (PM Modi) ne kaha, 'aapke bharpoor aashirwad or sahyog kaa parinaam he aaj jameen se antariksh tak bharat kaa danka baj rahaa he
 He said, 'I was told that Deve Gowda ji's son (kumaraswamy) has said that if Modi government is formed at the center again, he will retire from politics
 2014 ke chunaav ke pehle khud devegoda ji (H d Deve Gowda)ne bhi to yahi kaha tha
 But what did i retire after becoming my PM? ' 
 PM Modi said - 2019 this election is between nationalism and familyism
 nesan first or family first ke bich kaa he
 Congress and JDS are the symbols of this familyism in Karnataka
 donon hi partiyaan janata se jitani kati hui hai, utani hi apane parivaar se judi hui
 For these, your needs, not the needs of the country, but your selfishness is important
 kamishan hi inkaa mishan he
 When there is family concern, brokers like Quattrocchi and Michelle Mama are raised
 boforce se lekar helicopter ghotaale jaise paap vahaan kiye jate hai
 Look at the work done by the Congress, now it has also looted the rights of children and pregnant women to buy votes
 usne is loksabhaa chunaav main ek or ghotaalaa kar daalaa he
 Tughlaq Road election scam
 madhya pradesh main jahaan congress kii sarkaar he, vahaan se saikadon karod rupye chunaav ke liye dilli bheje gaye hai
 The money was for malnourished children, to satisfy the hunger of innocent children
 lekin congress itani nirdayee he, ki usne garib bacchon ke munh se niwala bhi chin liya
 PM Modi (PM Modi) said that till now we had heard Congress paw in defense deal, Congress paw in land deal, Congress paw in submarine deal, Congress paw in helicopter deal but now innocent children eat But the Congress has started to swoop
 main kal media main dekh rahaa tha ki karnataka ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki hamaari sena main vahi log jate hai jinhen do vakt kaa khaanaa nahin miltaa
 What kind of thinking is this, Kumaraswamy You cannot avoid saying that your statement was misinterpreted
 aapane vahi kaha he, jo aapke dil main he
 It is this thinking because of which the jds-congress and their great parties do not give any importance to the security of our country
 piem modi ne kaha ki yahi soch he jisaki vajah se inke har raksha saude main koi na koi ghotaalaa hota rahaa
 This is the thinking, because of which we continue to provide weapons of poor quality to our soldiers
 yahi soch he jisaki vajah se hamaare veeron ko seemaa par jaruri suvidhaayen nahin di jaati thim
 It is this thinking that caused these people to give up even bullet-proof jackets, for years they ignored the demand of bullet-proof jackets
 congress or jedies bhi rashtravaadiyon ke khilaaf, raashtra kii raksha karne waalon ke khilaaf hai
 These people are standing with the slogans of Bharat will be your piece
 ye log,vipaksh par barasate hue piem modi ne kaha ki bharat se alag karne waalon samarthak hai, unke khadey hai
 They have money for the celebration of the Sultan, but lose money to remember Hampi's pride
 sirf or sirf kuch vot jutaney ke liye jo hamaare sapooton ke shaury kaa saboot maangate hai, unase saavdhaan rahanaa zaruri he
 It is important to teach a lesson to those who are advancing Pakistan's propaganda only because Modi is at a disadvantage
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi kii inaki niyat hi he jisko karnataka kaa kisaan bhi bhugat rahaa he
 What is the reason today that this 'bhad Khanja' of Karnataka is craving for drop of water? tungabhadra or alamati jaise bade dam hone ke baavjood ye kshetra itnaa pyaasa kyon he? 24 ghante ke bheetar sabhi kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa vaayada kiya tha, uskaa kya hua?

 When India went to the International Court of Justice regarding the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, it was called a bold but shocking decision
 uski vajah yah thi ki 18 saalon baad bharat ne kisi maamle ko lekar international court of justise kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Generally, India has avoided going to the international stage for any dispute with Pakistan because it says that there is no need for any third intervention in the dispute between India and Pakistan
 lekin kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle ko lekar bharat ne jo teji dikhaai or jis tarah se international court of justise main aanan fanan main pakistan ko chaaron khaane chit kar diya use bharat ke liye bahut badi jeet kaha jayega
 Ronnie Abraham, the Chief Judge of the International Court of Justice, not only banned the hanging of Kulbhushan Yadav, but also rejected all the pleas of Pakistan
 kulbhushan yadav cese main bharat kii jeet main 5 khaas baaten rahi
 1
 15 jajon kii bench vaali international court of justise ke pramukh jaj roni abraham ne jo faisla sunaaya usamen sarvasammati thi yani sabhi ke sabhi ke sabhi jaj is faisle se sahamat the
 The court rejected Pakistan's arguments and said that the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav should be completely banned till the final verdict of this court comes
 itnaa hi nahin court ne pakistan ko yah bhi aadesh diya ki kulbhushan yadav kii faansee par roak lagane ke bare main pakistan sarkaar kya upaay kar rahi he or iske bare main koun-koun se kadam uthaa rahi he
 Information about all of them should be kept in front of this court
 2
 Pakistan had argued in its behalf in the International Court of Justice that the apprehension of immediate execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav is useless, as he has yet to open the way to appeal to the High Court of Pakistan and file mercy petition
 According to the law of Pakistan, they will get a time of 150 days for this
 lekin international court of justise ne apane faisle main kaha ki bharat ne jo ashanka vyakt kii he ki antim faisla aane se pehle hi kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee par latakaaya ja saktaa he paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue vah bebuniyaad nahin he
 The court said that given India's reasoning to prove its point and the way the entire judicial process in Kulbhushan Jadhav's case has been kept secret, India's apprehension is not baseless
 3
 Justice Ronnie Abraham elaborated on how counselor access to Kulbhushan Jadhav was not granted despite India's repeated efforts and how it was a violation of the Vienna Agreement which covers both India and Pakistan
 vienna samjhaute ke tahat kisi bhi desh ke naagarik ko agar duusare desh main giraftaar kiya jaataa he to us desh ko yah haq he ki apane naagarik ko nyaayik sahaayta uplabdh karaae
 In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, India has requested Pakistan for counselor access 16 times so far, but Pakistan has ignored it
 hegg ke antarrashtriya adaalat main pakistan ne yah tark dene kii koshish kii thi vienna samjhaute ke tahat jasusi ke aarope main pakade gaye logon ko nyaayik sahaayta dene kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 But dismissing Pakistan's plea completely, Justice Ronnie Abraham said that there is no mention in the Vienna Agreement that those who will be caught on espionage charges will not get this facility
 counslar acces dene ke maamle main justise abraham ne pakistan ko abhi koi sidhaa aadesh to nahin diya he, lekin jis tarah se pakistan kii daleelon ko radd kiya gaya he uske baad pakistan par is baat kaa behad dabaav bad jayega ki vah bharat ko kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main counslar acces de
 4
 international court of justise ne apane faisle main guuruuvaar ko kaha ki antim faisla aane tak kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee nahin di jaaegi
 The court said that the court is currently not commenting on the allegations made by Pakistan on Kulbhushan Yadav about their right or wrong, as they will be investigated later
 lekin yahaan par bhi pakistan ko jhatka laga kyonki court ne faisle main yah saaf kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav ko kin paristhitiyon main giraftaar kiya gaya yah ek vivaad kaa vishay he
 India has been consistently saying that Kulbhushan Jadhav was kidnapped, while Pakistan has alleged that he was arrested from Balochistan while spying
 ab pakistan ke upar is baat kaa dabaav hoga ki vah kulbhushan yadav kii giraftaar ke bare main saare saboot duniya ke saamne rakhe
 5
 kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main bharat ne jaisi teji dikhaai us se pakistan ke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 Pakistan had informed about the death sentence of Kulbhushan Jadhav on April 10
 ek maheene se bhi kam samay main 8 may ko bharat is maamle ko lekar antarrashtriya court main chalaa gaya
 On behalf of India, Harish Salve put the matter before the International Court of Justice so strongly that despite the leave, the matter was heard on 15 May
 uske 3 dinon ke bheetar hi 18 may ko bharat ne pakistan ko dhul chataate hue lagbhag apni sabhi maangon par antarrashtriya adaalat kii muhar lagava lee
 Now the whole world will be watching Pakistan on how they implement the decision of the world's largest court

 Did Jesus ever come to India? This question is quite controversial
 haalanki, ek tathy sabko pataa he ki isa messiah ke jivan ke 18 varshon kaa vivaran 'new testament' main nahin miltaa he
 These anonymous years of the life of Jesus Christ are also called 'silent Years', 'lost Years' or 'missing Years'
 jisas ke jivan ke itihaas main 13 kii umr se 29 tak kii umr kaa bible main koi ullekh nahin miltaa he
 In a BBC documentary it was reported that Jesus was a Buddhist monk
 haalanki, isse pehle bhi kai kitabon main jisas ke bharat aane kii baat kahi ja chuki thi
 In 1887, a Russian war correspondent, Nicholas Notovich, claimed that he had studied the document 'life of St Isa, Best of the Sons of Men', kept at the Hemis Monastery in Ladakh
 isa islam main jisas kaa arabi naam he
 Notovich's theory was published in the French language in 1894
 roosi vidwaan nicholas notovich ne 19veen shatabdi main bharat, tibet or afghanistan kaa daura kiya tha or kaha jaataa he ki usne leh kii ek tibet buddha monastery main kaaphi vakt bitaayaa
 Nicholas is claimed to have translated a document that tells the story of Jesus
 is kahani ke mutabik, isa pehali shatabdi main isroyal ke ek garib parivaar main paidaa hue the
 a llama had also told Notovich that Jesus attained enlightenment from 13 to 29 years of age
 lamas ne bataaya tha ki isa mahaan devdoot the or sabhi dalai lamaaon main se shreshth the
 He arrived in Jerusalem after learning from here and became the Messiah or Protector of Israel
 monastery ke ek anbhavi lamas ne ekanyuj agenciko bataaya tha ki isa messiah ne bharat main buddha dharm kii diksha lee thi or vah buddha ke vichaar or niyamon se bahut prabhavit the
 It is also said that Jesus initiated in many holy cities such as Jagannath, Rajagriha and Benaras and due to this the Brahmins were angered and excommunicated
 iske baad jisas himalay bhaag gaye or buddha dharm kii diksha lenaa jari rakhaa
 German scholar Holger Kersten wrote about the early life of Jesus and claimed that Jesus had settled with the Aryans in Sindh province
 levi ech
 Drooling In 19081908, Levi H
 Doling published the 'aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ' in which he claimed that he had received all the information from the supernatural forces, the true story of Jesus' life
 isamen new testament se gaayab 18 varshon kaa bhi vivaran diya gaya tha
 According to this book, the young Jesus visited India, Tibet, Iran, Greece and Egypt
 kashmir main bhi rahe jisas-bibisi ne “jesus Was a Buddhist Monk” naam se ek documentry banaai thi jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki jisas ko suuli par nahin chadhaaya gaya tha or jab vah 30 varsh ke the to vah apni pasandida jagah waapas chale gaye the
 According to the documentary, Jesus was not killed and moved to Afghanistan with the Jews
 report ke mutabik, sthaneey logon ne is baat kii pushti kii ki jisas ne kashmir ghati main kai varsh vyateet kiye the or 80 kii umr tak vahiin rahe
 If Jesus spent 16 years of adolescence and the last 45 years of his life, then according to this he lived about 61 years in India, Tibet and surrounding areas
 kai sthaneey logon kaa maananaa he ki kashmir ke srinagar main rojaa bal shrin main jisas kii samadhi bani hui he
 However, this tomb is officially the tomb of Euja Asaf, a medieval Muslim preacher
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ek mahaan buddha kii mrityu ke baad teen vidwaan apane lamas kii khoj ke liye nikle the
 In the Buddhist tradition, when the lama dies, the scholars go on a long journey in search of an infant by looking at the planets and constellations
 yah navjaat lamas kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 These were the same three scholars who reached Bethlehem on the night of Jesus' birth
 ek yah bhi vishwaas he ki jisas 13 kii umr main teen vidwaanon ke saath bharat aae the or ek buddha kii tarah bharat main unki parvarish hui
 Osho also said that the coming of Jesus Christ to India, Indian philosopher Osho has also said that Jesus Christ should be related to India
 osho ke mutabik, 'jab bhi koi satya ke liye pyaasa hota he, anayas hi vah bharat main utsuk ho uthta he
 Suddenly it starts on a journey to the east and it is not only today
 aaj se 2500 varsh purv, satya kii khoj main pithagoras bharat aayaa tha
 Jesus Christ also came to India
 osho ke mutabik,isamsih ke 13 se 30 varsh kii umr ke bich kaa bible main koi ullekh nahin he or yahi unki lagbhag puri jindagi thi, kyonki 33 varsh kii umr main to unhen suuli hi chadha diya gaya tha
 The accounts of thirteen to 30 to 17 years are missing from the Bible! Where have they been all the time? After all, why were those years not recorded in the Bible? They have been deliberately left out, that Islam is not the fundamental religion, that whatever Jesus is saying they have brought from India
 ''isa jab bharat aae the-tab buddha dharm bahut jeevant tha, yadhyapi buddha kii mrityu ho chuki thi
 Jesus came here five hundred years after Gautama Buddha
 par buddha ne itnaa viraat andolan, itnaa bada tufaan khadaa kiya tha ki tab tak bhi puraa mulk usamen duba hua tha
 Finally, Jesus died in India too! And Christian records have been ignoring this fact
 'fifth gospelnaam kii kitaab main bhi isi daawey kaa samarthan kiya gaya he ki isa messiah 13 se 29 varsh tak bharat bhraman karte rahe
 Many theories emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, claiming that Jesus came to India between the ages of 12 and 30
 haalanki, aadhunik mukhyadhara ke isai vidwaanon ne in sabhi theories ko khaarij kar diya he
 According to these scholars, nothing is clearly known about this time of Jesus' life
 isai vidwaanon ne khaarij kiya-tamaam vidwaan jisas ke bharat aane ke daawey ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hai
 Scholar Marcus Borg says that Jesus' claim to India and his connection to Buddhism have no historical basis
 lesli holden kehete hai, buddha or jisas kii shikshaaon main kaaphi samanthaayen hai lekin ye tulana 19veen sadi main mishnariyon ke sampark ke baad shuru hui
 There is no reliable historical evidence linking Jesus and Buddhism
 alag-alag vidwaanon ne is vishay par alag-alag siddhant die hai
 The 1992 book Jesus the Man states that Jesus survived after being crucified and then married Mary Magdalene

 haalanki pehali dukaan se chori kar choron kaa giroh duusari dukaan bhi luutane pahunch gaya
 They had broken the shutter of another shop, but they could not steal the shop and ran away after getting the call of someone
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki jis dukaan main chori hui, uske thik saamne police kii checkpost he
 But 4 of dawn
 0 baje police checkpost par koi pulicekarmi nahin tha
 Taking advantage of this, the thieves took 12 lakh rupees in just 12 minutes

 Which shows us the inexplicable distance between the wishes of Chacha / Behenji and Lalna and the circumstances of their lives
 waisi hi duuri rahati he in striyon ke swayan bhoge yatharth or samaaj dwaara dekhi gai unki asaliyat main
 They are constantly disappearing in the society
 kintu chachcho / bahanji or lalana apane antardvandvon or sangharshon kaa saamana bhi karti hai
 With that straightforward courage that becomes the nature of ordinary lives
 gitanjali shri ne in striyon ke gharelu jivan kii anubhutiyon, rosemara ke swaad, sparsh, mahak, drishy ko badi baariki se unki puri sansuality main ukera he
 Water sorrow remains under the shadow of memories under death
 ateet chunki bitta nahin, yaadon ke sahare apane jivan kaa arth paane vaale tirohit ke charitra 'lalana or bhatija' avibhajya ho jate hai divangat chachcho se
 And the children themselves take form in these memories
 pustak ansh: tirohitteble fain vah vaala jise ek baar chor ne chalata hua uthaane kii koshish kii thi, chat se aangan main rassi daalkar, maano talab se machhlee pakadta ho! usee ke baad chachaa ne, ki lalana ne, yaa phir chachchon ne, aangan par tatootor dalava diya
 Summer nights! What is done on summer nights? Slept on the terrace
 par chat to puure mohalle kii he, maar bheed-bhaad, shor-sharaaba, chaand kii tarah taakazanki
 Chupke Chupke sahali-sahali
 hawa kii tarah sharaaraten
 Somewhere the jug has been laid on the mundar that after getting up at night, drink water of the smell of clay soil
 kahin khaat par kori chaadaren bichhi hai, takiyon ko gol marodakar masanad bana daalaa he, thahaake laga rahe hai
 Just a little, someone has also burnt the fireplace and is rolling it with soft loins from the plate, baking it hot and hot
 gilahari sote-sote jag gai he or ummid nahin chhod paa rahi ki aate main uske naam bhi hissaa he, do kadam aage dar-dar ke, bees kadam peeche or dar ke
 Roof of Labernum House
 abhi bhi kabhi-kabhi sarrafon kii chat kehalaati he
 In the eighteenth century, it was the locality of the rulers and their king made it a place of living and selling under one roof
 kahin unchi, kahin nichi chat
 All-weather ceiling
 har rishte kii himachati chat
 Free ceiling aseem se aseem ko laanghati hui
 In eighteen seventy-seven, there were so many gardens hidden in these houses that when a group of Britishers came, jumping down the road from house to house and jumping down the locality! It is heard that one of the two great grandfathers of Chamanji was with the rebels, the other with the British, and during those fighting days both of them hid from each other and gave shelter to their teammates
 ek din ek idhar kaa chipa chat ke raste bhaag rahaa tha or udhar kaa ek, chat ke usee raste chhipane aa rahaa tha
 Both collided in the path and fell on the roof from top to bottom, causing a sprain in one's leg
 aise main duusare ne donon haathon se sahaara dekar use chajje se upar khinchaa or tab phir gaayab ho gaya
 Even today it is easy to disappear on this terrace
 kisi kaa ghar do-manjila, kisi kaa teen, kahin paur se laga zeena, kahin aangan kii diwaar se satee lohe kii seedhi
 Insert the raised doors, pillars, balcony, tanks on the roof
 ek kadam is oot, doosraa kadam us oot or nau-do-gyaarah
 Knowing this, Sudhir Chandra fled in 1942, when the police reached to capture his Baba, who was active in the movement
 are bachwa bhaag, unki daadi chillaai
 Tohar baba te hai nahi hai, this executioner will give tohike buns lageen dene gaaliyaan phir deshadrohi, vardiposh, angrejon ke tattuon ko
 The fun is that Sudhir Chandra was not even a big patriot if not a traitor
 inter, bie kuch kar rahe the or bas itani-si aakanksha thi ki acchhee-bhalee koi naukari, kaale, gore, pile, laal, jiske tale, paa jaaen
 Do not spoil Udhami Baba Future, run with your feet on your head
 par abake jo chat par udhar se dauda aa rahaa tha, usne aise kisi rukh kaa sanket nahin diya ki paas aa, sahaara de hat jaaounga
 Put neem on one side and mustard on the other side! It is said that Sudhir Chandra wanted to hang on Neem's twig that the grandmother shouted from behind, hey, he would die, he would have had to die while climbing his own sticks
 sudheerchandra gadabada gaye or jis safaai se daaroga kii banhon main samaa gaye laga ki bas yahi to iraadaa rahaa unka! police thane le jaae gaye, report darj hui, chhod do ise, ve adrishy moonchhon ko taav dekar kehete hai daaroga ne kaha, or kehete hai chhod diya gaya mujhe par 1942 main meri bhi shirkat darj ho gai to provinshayal judishal sarvice ke imtihaan main gres marks mil gaye to dekha, daadi ne mujhe afasar bana diya
 Knowing all this about the roof, Pankhachor tried his luck
 'main sochuun ye pankhaa achaanak dagamag-dagamag kaise karne laga
 'she would tell
 'chor-chor, main chillaai,'' lalana bataati
 'I got up so that i should pull the same with a rope down, but your children were lying in a sheet
 maar garmi ke saare kapade jo khol daale the!'chor-chor sunakar chat par achaanak sab taraf log bhaagane lage
 Some said, the bus got caught
 koi bolaa, tel chupede lambaa-tagada langotadhari haathon se phisal gaya
 It was like a monkey, someone said, someone else was engaged in the eternal
 gadaansa khons ke aayaa tha teesraa bolaa
 Many did not say anything
 bhagdad main andheri chumbanon main vyast ho gaye
 Uncle and i ran down towards the courtyard, then chato and lalana were pulling blouse, and dhoti was coughing in the draw of the same sheet
 chandani raat main ek saath nire stan chamak uthe

 The court has summoned the Principal Secretary Health of Delhi Government and ordered to appear on December 17 and asked why the Delhi Government has not taken any action to close such pathological labs till now, the Principal Secretary Health has come to the court itself Please tell
 hai court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki dilli sarkaar supreme court ke adeshon kaa paalan kyon nahin kar rahi he jo pathological leb ko chalaane ke liye jaruri he
 At present, there are only 132 labs in Delhi which are legally permitted to run pathology labs
 lekin hajaaron kii taadaad main dilli main avaidh pathological lab dhadlle se chal rahi hai
 The court reprimanded the Delhi government and said that after all why our orders have not been followed yet, by raiding the pathology labs running in this way, they identify those people who are not just ordinary people by keeping the rules and laws
 Not only putting people's lives at risk, but also driving pathology in an illegal way
 court is baat se naaraaz tha ki janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke baad dilli sarkaar ne sirf ek public notice jari kar diya, do akhabaaron main uskaa vigyaapan de diya gaya
 But to curb such pathology labs, no officer went out of his office to pathology labs to know the ground truth
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se 2010 main clinical ysteblishment act union territries ke liye lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Governments in many states have implemented it but in the capital Delhi, the Delhi government wants to implement a new bill instead of implementing it
 haalanki abhi yah tay nahin he ki sarkaar is bill ko kab tak lagu kar paaegi or avaidh chal rahi hajaaron hajaar pathology labs par lagaam lagane ke liye is nae kanoon main kitni sakhti barti jaaegi
 About twelve o'clock at night, Joint Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti received a call from the Police Control Room about a woman who was trapped in the Taj
 bharti taj main enesji ke saath koordination kaa kaam dekh rahe the
 The call did not come directly to Bharti, but Priya Florence Martis, who was hiding in her data center from the time the firing started in Taj, called her uncle, who informed the police control room
 unka saathi manish sarwar room ke ek anya hisse main chipa hua tha
 They had nothing to eat and drink since the terrorist attack
 bharti brigadier sisodiya ke saath resepshan tak gaye
 He dialed in Florence's office extension
 duusari ore se ek dari hui aawaaj sunai di
 Bharti put the phone on the speaker for Sisodia to hear
 sisodiya ne poocha, ''mam, aap kahaan hai?”priya aise maahaul main puri tarah kanphyus ho chuki thim
 He did not remember the way to the hotel
 unhone bas itnaa hi kaha, ''duusari manzil par
 
 
 "sisodia comforted him," Don't panic, my commandos will take you
 ” phir unhone priya kii bataai jagah ko hotel ke ek kaagaj par likhaa or use shyoran ko de diya
 Sheoran instructed Major Unnikrishnan to bring them
 enesji ke afasaron ne un tak pahunchane ke liye vaikalpik rasta nikaala—yah rasta heritage wing kii bhavy sidhippon vaala tha
 Unni planned to go to the second floor from this
 in raaston ko ab bhi saaf nahin kiya gaya tha
 DCP nangre-patil soldiers had to face heavy firing of militants in the same area last night
 unni ko is bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 Major Sandeep went up the same path to his team of Sunil Jodha, Manoj Kumar, Babulal and Kishore Kumar at one o'clock on the night of 28 November: that magnificent ladder which was quite long and straight, went ahead in two ways like the English alphabet
 i used to get divided
 do hisson main bantane se thik pehle seedhi par jamshedji tata kii ek kaansya pratimaa lagi hui thi jis par maalaaen thim, jinhone tata ke kaarobaar ko sthapit kiya tha or 1903 main is hotel ko banaaya tha
 As the team moved up the stairs, there was a sudden firing in the dark
 pataa chalaa ki aatankwaadi upar se fire kar rahe the
 Unni signaled Babulal and Sunil to the left, with huge brown doors through which to reach the Palm Lounge and Ballroom
 unhen grenade phenkakar palm lounj kaa rasta saaf karnaa tha
 Both commandos proceeded quietly with arms down
 unhone daravaaje ke donon ore pojishan sambhaal lee
 The doors were closed
 (taj ke kichan main kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon ke shav)achaanak andhere main kahin se ek grenade udata hua aayaa,kaaleen vaali seedhi par gira or fat gaya
 The sound of AK 47 running from above
 uski goliyon ne sidhiyon ko chhed diya tha
 The bullets penetrated the walls around the door and stones and lime were pouring from the walls
 tata kii pratimaa ko gherne vaala kaanch tut chukaa tha
 This was a covert attack
 aatankiyon ne enesji commando ke kapade dekh liye the or unhone inke aane tak intjaar kiya tha
 They were in a strong position
 ab yahaan maut kaa khel hona baaki tha
 Major Unnikrishnan kept moving between the cover fire of his two commandos
 uske baad ek or grenade upar kii kisi manzil se laharaata hua aayaa or grenite ke farsh par fata
 About 5,000 ball bearings released from the grenade had set the scene of death around the stairs
 sunil jodha kii deh ko goliyaan or chharre puri tarah chhed gaye the
 They fell and rolled down the stairs to the statue of Tata
 cover fire de rahe commando ne apane adrishy dushman par goliyon kii bauchhaar kar di
 Sunil's body was bleeding
 do goliyaan unki chaati main lagi thim
 One was stuck in a ceramic rifle plate fitted in his bulletproof jacket
 unka baayan haath steel ke bering se chotil ho chukaa tha
 He felt numb on the floor, "my left hand is gone
" ”unni bhagkar sunil ke paas aae
 Seeing the blood leaking from his body, he said to Babulal, "take it for first aid
 ” or aisa kahkar achaanak ek jatke main ve akele upar palm lounj tak pahunch gaye
 (commandos outside the harbor bar) Unni waving his MP5 and dodging bullets towards the atrium
 goliyaan deevaaron ko chhed gayi
 After this he climbed the stairs to go towards the other doors that opened in the Palm Lounge
 yah ek jokhim bharaa kadam tha kyonki unhen cover karne ke liye koi nahin tha
 If their contact with the bottom was broken, then the game of cat and mouse was about to start again
 unhone tay kiya ki unhen achaanak hamalaa kar ke aatankwaadiyon ko chaunkaa dena he
 They were walking so carefully that their shoes were not even sounding
 unhen apane saamne bikhri hui vishaal kursiyaan or teble najar ai
 He searched the cartridge
 sirf ek grenade bachaa tha
 He unfastened the pin of the grenade and bounced into the lounge
 grenade kaaphi aawaaj ke saath fata, jisase khidkiyaan chakanachur ho gayi
 Unni entered inside amid this explosion
 phir unhone samudr kii ore khulne vaali khidakiyon kii ore golibari kii
 In front of them was a brown grille, which covered the ballroom like a metal casing
 unke nishane par yahi bollroom tha
 Moving fast enough in the corridor, he taunted the MP5 right in front of him
 unki bain ore choti-si angannuma jagah thi jisamen do sofe or ek gol aakaar kaa grenite tebletop rakhaa hua tha
 Suddenly there was an attack from under the table and two voices were heard almost simultaneously - one of the ak-47s and the other firing from the MP5
 (hotel kii lobby main empi5 relod karte commando)'sierra five, sierra five
 
 
 This is Sierra One, Come In
 over
 'colonel Shioran's message was echoing in the Taj's fijas but there was no one to listen to him
 koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 Brigadier Sisodia said, "maybe they are very close to him, that's why he is not speaking
" 
 
 
 "the NSG cleaned up the burnt southern tip of the hotel, that is, the sea-facing lounge on the second floor
 ab hotel ke uttari hisse main sampark ke saare ahm raaston par enesji commando kaa kabja tha
 By 3 am on Friday, November 28, Major Kandwal's team had evacuated all 21 floors of the Taj Tower
 kandawal ne tower mumbai police ke kabje main saunp diya
 Four hours later the potential hostages were removed from all rooms in both hotels
 ab aatankiyon kii talash kaa samay tha
 But where was Major Unnikrishnan? Sheoran reached the fourth floor and looked down the stairs at the atrium
 atrium ke ird-gird galiyare kshat-vikshat shavon se bhare pade the
 His commando Havildar Digharam whispered and said, "sir, look at these dead bodies
 ” laashen phool rahi thim
 36 hours had passed since the terrorist attack
 phija main durgandh tair rahi thi
 There was a mixed smell of rotten food and rotten corpses
 dikkat yah thi ki in laashon ko hataaya nahin ja saktaa tha kyonki bubi trep saaf karne ke baad 'rendor sef proscisger’ purna hone par hi enesji aisa kar sakati thi
 For this it was necessary that the terrorists should be eliminated from the buildings
 shyoran ko haalanki unni kii chintaa thi or ve unhen hi khoj rahe the
 He first saw it on the first floor where he had his first encounter with the terrorists
 uske chaar daravaaje the
 One of these doors was open, which was in the oblique direction of the Tata statue
 yah hotel ke bheetar le jaataa tha
 Unni went in search of terrorists in the opposite direction
 savere saadhe chah baje ek awasaiya bhawan kii chat par tainaat jasrotiya ke radio main achaanak harakat hui, ''sierra sicks, dis ij sierra van, kam tu oparation centre
 Over
 ” shyoran ko laapata major kii talash ke liye or logon kii jarurat thi
 The size of the team was reduced
 jasrotiya ko do hit timen di gayi or pehali manzil par unni ko talashne kaa kaam diya gaya
 They had to start the search in the kitchen area, where Major John, a newly arrived officer, was stationed
 shyoran ke adhikari lagaataar unni ke mobile par dial kar rahe the
 But that switch was off
 
 
 kareeb saadhe nau baje major kandawal or major jasrotiya ne unni ke kadamon ke nishaan dekhte hue us ore chalanaa shuru kiya
 They kept moving like a pair
 jasrotiya ne apni empi5 saamne kii ore taan rakhi thi
 Kandwal taunted his MP5, covering the back
 achaanak sangemarmar ke farsh par ek kaali akruti padi hui dikhaai di
 Unni! His left leg was bent under the right
 daayan baaju failaa hua tha or baayan chaati par tha
 The body was riddled with bullets
 unki laash jam chuke khun ke dher main padi hui thi
 All the bullets were shot from the left side
 jis goli se unki maut hui, vah nichle jabade se ghusi or sir ko chirati hui upar nikal gai thi
 The walkie-talkie was exactly two feet away from the head and switched off
 unke anguuthe se ek grenade kii pin kii ring latak rahi thi
 It did not take long to find out what would have happened
 aatankwaadi murti ke peeche teble or sofe ke neeche chhipe the
 He had targeted Unni while moving along the corridor
 unni ko eke-47 kii goliyaan lagi thim
 The terrorists had taken out their weapons in the northern part of the hotel
 aisa nahin ki unni ne unhen jawaab nahin diya
 He fired heavily on his attackers, which is evident from the fact that Unni's MP5 bullets were embedded in the walls and wooden mesh
 vahiin ek aatanki kaa khun main sanaa juuta chhot gaya tha
 Moving towards the ballroom, blood stains were telling that Unni had injured the fleeing terrorist
 kandawal ne apane mobile se kol kiya
 No one should find out that an officer has been killed
 ve bole, ''sar, unni nahin rahe
 confirm
 ” kuch der kaa sannata
 On the other hand Colonel Shioran's voice could not hide his resentment, "okay, wait
" kisi ko bhejtaa hum
 "(former Home Minister Shivraj Patil in an aircraft carrying SAG commandos on 27 November 2008) Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was the first officer of the NSG killed in the attack
 unki shahadat ne 51 esaiji ko hilaa diya
 It was a farewell from a dear friend that made him feel mortal
 major unnikrishnan ke aakhri hamale kii vajah se aatanki taj ke uttari hisse main restaraan kii ore jane ko majaboor hue the
 They could not go further than that
 shyoran ne tay kiya ki unni kii maut ko bekaar nahin jane denge
 They set up their snipers to cover the northern part

 bihar ke logon ko rail bajet main is baar 'mamata' kii darkaar he

 aisi yojanaayen, jinaki ghoshnaa to kii gai lekin un par kaam shuru nahin ho paaya, unhen jald se jald shuru kiya jaae taaki unki yatra kii mushkilen aasaan ho saken
 The people of the state allege that Bihar is constantly being neglected in the railway budget of the last two-three years
 jo kuch bhi bihar ko mil rahaa he, vah lollypop se zyada kuch nahin he
 This is the reason that Bihar has lagged behind in the rail sector
 bihar se kai rail mantri hue hai, jinamein rajya ke maujuuda mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, purv mukhyamantri va rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav, lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ke naam ullekhneey hai
 During this time many railway projects were announced for Bihar, many were also implemented, but after the current Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee took over the railway ministry, Bihar lagged behind
 rajya main kai aise kshetra hai, jo aaj bhi rail sampark se nahin jud paae hai
 If Harnaut railway factory is not able to come into existence till date, Madhaura diesel engine factory is also waiting for completion
 isi tarah chhapra main rail chakkaa nirmaan kaarkaane se bhi ab tak utpaadan shuru nahin ho sakaa he to madhepura electric ingine kaarkaana bhi sarkari filon main gum he
 These railway projects could not only provide employment to the unemployed in Bihar, but could also add new dimensions of development
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke professor arthshaastri egg ke choudhary bataate hai ki rail ke maamle main bihar aaj bhi kaaphi pichhadaa he
 a large area of bihar is connected with Nepal
 in kshetron main rail sampark badhaane kii jarurat he
 Danapur and Rajendranagar railway stations also need to be developed in view of heavy congestion at Patna Junction
 bihar times ke sampadak ajay kumaar bataate hai ki rajya se surat, mumbai or dilli jane ke liye yatriyon kii baari bheed rahati he
 This also needs to be noted
 isi tarah, patna ke aasapaas ke jila mukhyalayon se pratidin hajaaron kii taadaad main log naukari ke silsile main yahaan aate hai
 But they have to wait for three to four hours for trains
 rail mantralay kii praathamikta patna ke najdiki jila mukhyalayon par kam antaraal par railgadiyaan dene kii honi chahie
 The Bihar Chamber of Commerce also believes that the Duronto Express from Patna to New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai is one of the most prominent demands of this budget
 bihar ab vikaas kar rahaa he
 Neglect of this state in the Railway Budget will not only betray the people here, but it will also be a hindrance in the development of Bihar
 rajya ke logon kaa kahana he ki bihar main aaj bhi paryatakon kii sankhya goa jaise paryatak sthalon se bhi adhik he, aise main avaagaman kii suvidha naa hona is kshetra kii upeksha hogi
 People complain that the goal of completing the digha-sonepur rail bridge is continuously moving forward, which should have been completed three years ago

 Sources have said that Prime Minister Modi will now travel to two European countries, France and Germany, along with the journey of Canada
 yaad rahe ki pradhanmantri ke april ke duusare hafte main hone vaali yatra kii tarikhon ko lekar bharat kii ore se europea sangh ke paas suzav bhi die gaye the
 According to sources, the government has moved ahead with the Prime Minister's itinerary without visiting Brussels if the European Union does not respond to it
 bharat ke suzav par is asaamaanya pratikriya ke peeche kaa kaaran puche jane par sutron ne spasht taur par kuch nahin bataaya, haalanki yah kaha he ki yah 28 sadasyeey europea sangh kaa aantarik maamla he
 According to speculation, one reason for the EU not responding to India's proposal could also be that the EU is upset over the delay in hearing in the case of two Italian marines accused of killing Indian fishermen
 europea sangh kii videsh niti maamalon kii nayi pramukh federika mogerini ne is mudde par kai aise bayaan die hai jo ki bharat ko asahaj karne vaale the
 Another reason may be that Federica has been expressing concern over the Ukraine crisis and Russia's role in it, and India has refused to stand in line with Western countries on the matter
 vahiin europe ke kai chote deshon ne daure ke talane ko lekar nakhushi jaahir kii he, kyonki ve ise bharat-iyu sambandhon ko aage badhane ko avasar ke taur par dekh rahe the

 film ‘jo jeeta vahi sikandar’ main apane abhinay se prasiddh hui abhinetri puja bedi ne kaha ki jaruri nahin he ki ‘big bos’ jaise reality sho se pratibhaagiyon ke kariyar ko naatakeey badhaava mili
 Actress and reality TV star Pooja Bedi is among the celebrity contestants of the fifth season of the popular TV reality show 'bigg Boss', which started on 2 October
 puja ne kaha, ‘jo log kariyar ko aage badhaane ke uddeshy se ‘big bos’ main shaamil hote hai unhen yahaan nahin aana chahie kyonki yahaan aa jane se aapako kaam nahin miltaa
 i do not think that anyone should use this show as a platform to promote their career because nobody has got a new career by coming here
 ’puja ne kaha ki chaahe wo rahul roy hon yaa shaveta tiwari, wo aaj bhi utane hi safal hai jitne wo pehle the
 There is no dramatic success here
 haa kuch log jarur labhanvit hue hai jaise raakhi saavant, lekin unhone bhi apane khud kii mehnat or prayaason se wo mukaam paaya jahaan wo aaj hai
 He said that this is a good social experiment
 yahaan aapako puraa desh tivi par vaise hi dekhtaa he jaise aap asal main hai
 People develop a sense of belonging to you, they see you and vote for you
 isse nazdikiyaan banati hai
 Pooja has worked in many reality shows before
 puja isse pehle ‘jhalak dikhalaa ja’, ‘nach baliye’, ‘khataron ke khilaadi’ or ‘maa exange’ jaise reality shoj main pratibhaagi ke taur par shaamil rahi hai
 Pooja is known for her direct answering style
 ‘maa exange’ main hasya kalakaar rajeev nigam kii patni ke saath unka bahut jhagada hua tha
 Looking at this, it seems that 'bigg Boss' show will also be very fun
 puja ne kaha, ‘maine ‘khataron ke khilaadi’ jaise shaareerik kshamtaaon kaa pareekshan karne vaale reality sho main kaam kiya, ‘jhalak dikhalaa ja’ main apni nrity kaushal kii jaanch kii or ‘maa exange’ main apane vyaktitv or paariwarik jivan ko dikhaaya
 The platform of 'bigg Boss' is a means to know yourself, to find out and to know your likes and dislikes, forces and weaknesses
 yahaan mujhe khud ko behatar rup main jaanane kaa mauka milegaa kyonki jin paristhitiyon main ham honge wo bahut vipareet hongi
 He said, 'I have a lot of energy, so living in a closed house is like a challenge for me
 main 24 ghante camere kii nigaraanee main rahane se nahin darati

 Who got what in the cabinet minister? centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ke khilaaf shivasena ke talkh tevar barkaraar he
 The Shiv Sena, an ally in the NDA, has now targeted the Modi government's ambitious Mudra Yojana
 shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main swarozgaar ko badhaava dene ke uddeshy se chalaai gai ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke bakaayaa kaa jahaan naam liya he, vahiin hazaron karod kaa karj dubokar videsh bhaag jane waalon kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The editorial article in 'saamana' started by citing concerns raised by the Reserve Bank about the dues of the loans distributed under the Mudra scheme
 lekh main likhaa gaya he ki ‘mudra’ yojana ke tahat vitarit kiye gaye karjon ke bakaae ko lekar rigerv bank ne chintaa jataai he
 The amount of this outstanding debt has reached 11 thousand crore rupees
 sarkari or nijee bainkon ke bakaae tathaa duubate karj kaa pahaad pichley kai varshon se gambhir charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 Some industrialists have run out of the country by dipping a debt of thousands of crores of rupees from above and this topic has become even more 'booger'
 isi parshwabhoomi par ab ‘mudra’ jaisi yojana kii bakaayaa raashi bhi kuch hajaar karod rupee tak pahunch gai he
 Therefore, his news has also been published in the media
 lekh main shivasena kii ore se likhaa gaya he ki mudra yojana kaa bahut dhindhora peeta gaya lekin agar ‘mudra’ kii bakaayaa raashi par rigerv bank kii ore se jataai gai chintaa kaa charchaa vishay ban jaae to aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 'saamana' has written- "as per the Reserve Bank report, 2 till 2017-18 under the Mudra scheme
 46 lakh karod rupee ke karj vitarit kiye gaye hai, isamen se 40 pratishat karj mahila udyojakon ko tathaa 33 pratishat karj ‘stand ap india’ ke liye diya gaya he
 4 total
 81 karod laghu udyojakon ko pichley varsh is yojana ke tahat karj baanta gaya he
 The outstanding amount has reached Rs 11 thousand crore
 pehle se hi bakaae karj ke boj tale dabi hamaari arthvyavastha ko ye ‘chota’ sa bojha bhi ab baari padane laga he
 'the article further writes,' Both the few lakh crores of rupees kept by big entrepreneurs for many years and Rs 11 thousand crores stuck with small and medium businesses of 'mudra' are also different
 mudra yojana ke tahat kareeb 2
 Loans worth 46 lakh crores have been disbursed
 jabaki bade udyogon ko vitarit kiya gaya karj arabon rupayon kaa he
 All are small-medium and women entrepreneurs of Mudra Yojana
 unke vyavsaayik kaarobaar kaa turn over bahut hi chota he
 It will take some time for his business to stabilize and get profit
 upar se unhen shuruaati dinon main notebandi or jiesti jaise nirnyon kii maar sahani padi he
 If this decision is adversely affecting the economy of the country, then it will also have an impact on the business of small-medium industries
 pichley do-dhai varshon main desh kii aarthik vikaas kii gati kam hui he
 The industry and entrepreneurs of Mudraija Mudra Yojana have also had to bear it
 'shivasena ne ‘mudra yojana’ kaa jo 11 hazaar karod rupee kaa bakaayaa dikh rahaa he, uske liye modi sarkaar ke faisle ko hi kuch had tak zimmedaar tehraaya he
 It has been written in the article that 'though all defaulters of' Mudra 'are' honest 'or' weaker than conditions', it is not so
 iske alaava bakaayaa to bakaayaa hi hota he har udyog ko karj kii kisht niyamit rup se bharani hi chahie
 With the finger pointing towards the situation, government policy, global boom and recession, every entrepreneur starts keeping arrears, what will happen to the country? Whatever be the outstanding debt, the burden falls on the economy and every citizen
 isiilie laghu-madhyam udyogon ke paas 11 hajaar karod ke bakaae kii mudra rigerv bank ko chintajanak lag rahi hogi or bank ne use vyakt kiya hoga to isamen galat kuch bhi nahin he
 Just having outstanding loans of a few hundred million Dubanewale trying to be a rule and up 'stand little debt' start-up 'with industry business under the new hope of' currency 'plan' for big business by new entrepreneurs second There should not be rules
 unke paas bakaae karj ko kam karne ke liye bank jarur koshish karen lekin nae udyojakon ke nirmaan par uske kaaran ‘ghaav’ lage, aisa kuch nahin hona chahie

 The auction will take place after the cabinet decided to reduce the reserve price in the 800 mhz band

 After the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers (egom), Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said, all the auctions will be held in March
 sidime nilaamee ke bare main unhone kaha ki sabhi cirkilon main 800 megahatrj band ke liye boli aamantrit kii jaaegi
 Meanwhile, sources said that EGOM has proposed a 30 to 50 percent reduction in CDMA spectrum price and the cabinet will take a final decision in this regard
 sutara ne kaha, mantrimandal sidime spectrum keemat ke bare main nirnay karegaa
 The auction will begin on March 11
 sarkaar pichley saal november main hui sidime spectrum kii nilaamee karne main vifal rahi
 Due to the high reserve price, no one came forward to bid for it
 1800 megahatrj band main jiesem spectrum ke liye arakshit mulya ke mukaable, sidime spectrum kaa arakshit mulya 1
 Was 3 times higher
 deshbhar ke liye 1800 megahatrj band main 5 megahatrj spectrum hetu arakshit mulya 14,000 karod rupee rakhaa gaya tha
 The comments pichhali nilaamee main sarkaar ko spectrum bikri se keval 9,407 karod rupee praapt hue, jabaki isse 28,000 karod rupee kii aay kii ummid kii ja rahi thi
 The reason for this was the high reserve price
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne pichley saal farvari main 2ji spectrum aavanton maamle main 122 license radd kar die
 This includes licenses for used Shyam Teleservices in 21 circles and Tata Teleservices license in three circles
 in companiyon ke liye sambhddha cirkilon main seva main bane rahane ke liye spectrum lenaa jaruri he
 In this case their license will expire on January 18, but the two companies did not participate in the auction due to the high reserve price
 mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh (ijioem) kii baithak ke baad doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha, sabhi nilaamee march main hogi

 "the Cabinet will decide the CDMA spectrum price," the source said
 nilaamee 11 march ko shuru hogi
 The government failed to auction the CDMA spectrum held in November last year
 ucch arakshit mulya ke kaaran koi bhi iske liye boli lagane aage nahin aayaa
 As against the reserve price for GSM spectrum in 1800 mhz band, the reserve price of CDMA spectrum is 1
 3 guna adhik tha
 The reserve price for 5 mhz spectrum in 1800 mhz band for the country was kept at Rs 14,000 crore
 tippaniyan In the previous auction, the government received only Rs 9,407 crore from the sale of spectrum, while an income of Rs 28,000 crore was expected from it
 iskaa kaaran ucch arakshit mulya tha
 The Supreme Court canceled 122 licenses in the 2G spectrum allocation case in February last year
 isamen sistemaal shyaam teleservices ko 21 cirkilon main mila license tathaa teen cirkilon main tata teleservices ko mila license shaamil he
 It is necessary for these companies to take spectrum to remain in service in the respective circles

 In February last year, the Supreme Court referred the Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor case to the Constitutional Bench
 dilli kiaam aadmi party sarkaror uparajyapal ke bich adhikaron ko lekar matbhed jagajaahir he
 The state government repeatedly accuses the Lieutenant Governor of hanging files

 Also, the court had asked the Delhi government to stay within its limits
 justise chandrachud ne yah bhi tippanee kii ki public order, police or jameen ye vishay dilli sarkaar ke paas nahin hai
 The center has authority over these
 isse pehle chif justise deepak mishra ne kaha ki dilli main kaamkaaj ke liye adhiktar niyam kaayade or kanoon to pehle hi bane hue hai
 The government simply implements them
 jahaan niyam nahin he, vahaan dilli sarkaar niyam bana sakati he, lekin centre yani raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad
 Earlier, on behalf of the Delhi government, senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam, while giving information about the executive rights of the state government, said that the Delhi government has the right to make laws for Delhi under Article 239A of the Constitution
 alji kii madad or salaah ke liye mantrimandal hota he
 The advice of the cabinet has to be accepted by the Lieutenant Governor
 hoicourt ne LG ko bataaya bosisase pehle dilli sarkaar banaam uparajyapal ke bich adhikaron kii ladaai par faisla sunaate hue dilli hoicourt 4 agast, 2016 ko die apane faisle main yah kah chukaa he ki uparajyapal hi dilli ke prashasnic pramukh hai
 Delhi government cannot make laws without lg's consent
 alji dilli sarkaar ke faisle ko maanane ke liye kisi bhi tarah se baadhya nahin hai
 He can take a decision based on his discretion while the Delhi government will have to take lg's consent before issuing any notification
 hoicourt ke is faisle ke khilaaf rajya sarkaar ne supreme court kaa rukh kiya tha, paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne lambii sunwaayee ke baad 6 disambar 2017 ko apana faisla surakshit rakhaa tha
 The government's figure of thirty-six from LG has been a continuous battle between the state government and the Lieutenant Governor after Arvind Kejriwal came to power
 kejariwal kaa pehle uparajyapal najeeb jang or phir anil baijal ke saath sangharsh hameshaa charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he

 kya hai kejariwal sarkaar ke wo 10 tark:1
 From peon to transfer of officers to transfer-posting and to take action against them, the government officials do not accept the orders of the elected government
 2
 Due to the service department being made under the Deputy Governor, guest teachers could not be appointed and new teachers were appointed
 3
 Not being under the services department, the government could not appoint doctor paramedical and nursing staff to run many newly created Mohalla clinics
 4
 Since the anti-corruption Branch was brought under the Lieutenant Governor, the government has not been able to take any action against the corrupt employees and officials, leading to increased corruption in the government

 The elected government ceased to be merely an advisory role
 kyon shuru hui dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich jang?1
 In April 2015, the Arvind Kejriwal government came to Delhi after electing a new fledgling
 sarkaar karpshan ke maamalon par behad sakht or tezi se karrwai kar rahi thi apni anti karpshan branch ke zarie
 Then one day Anti Corruption Branch arrested the constable of Delhi Police and arrested him in the case
 2
 There was a lot of tussle between Delhi Police and Delhi Government on this
 centre sarkaar bhi us jawan ke bachaav main ai
 There was a demand from the ACB to give the case of Delhi Police jawan to Delhi Police but the Delhi Government did not accept yaheen se dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke rishton main khatas aani shuru ho gai
 3
 iske baad may 2015 main tatkaaleen dilli ke mukhya sachiv ke ke sharma ke chuttee par jane kii vajah se dilli sarkaar ko kuch dinon ke liye ek kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv ko niyukt karnaa tha
 Minister of Services Department Manish Sisodia suggested the name of IAS officer Parimal Rai but LG appointed Power Secretary Shakuntala Gamlin as acting Chief Secretary
 4
 Since then the Delhi government has launched an attack against the Lieutenant Governor and the Deputy Chief Minister has declared him to be a conspiracy to overthrow the elected government
 5
 The then government secretary Anindo Majumdar, who had approved the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin without the consent of the elected government, was removed from the post by the Delhi government and also locked her room
 6
 The central government issued a notification in May 2015 announcing that the government in Delhi now means the Lieutenant Governor and the services department will not be under the authority of the elected government but under the Lieutenant Governor
 7
 In this order, the Central Government handed over the Anti Corruption Branch of Delhi Government to the Lieutenant Governor and ordered him not to take action against any officer or employee under any Central Government
 8
 The Lieutenant Governor appointed IPS Mukesh Meena as the head of ACB through the services department and the Delhi government lost control over ACB
 9
 All the big rights came out of the hands of the Delhi government, in protest of which she went to the Delhi High Court and from there the legal battle of Delhi Government vs Lt
 Governor started

 Reminding him of Sonia Gandhi's renunciation, he said, "those making such a statement should understand that the Congress had asked Sonia Gandhi not once but several times to take over as PM
" par unhone manaa kar diya
 This has never happened in the political history of the country

 Reliance Jio has announced the withdrawal of its summer surprise offer
 is elaan ke peeche kii vajah ye he ki yah ofer telecom regaulatory athurity ke regaullation ke khilaaf he
 TRAI Chairman RS Sharma has said that TRAI has ordered the closure of the Complimentary Service Offer from Jio
 TRAI ke chairman ne pitiai ko bataaya he, ‘hamane is ofer kii jaanch kii he or paaya bahai ki yah regaulatory fremawork ke khilaaf he
 Therefore, we have asked to stop it
 TRAI ke aadesh ke baad jeeyo ne samar sarpriceofer ko waapas lene kaa elaankia he
 However, most users have subscribed to Prime Service and are now part of the Summer Surprise Offer
 aise main sirf samar sarprise ofer sabsakripshan kii taarikh gata dene se yah ofer khatm kaise ho gaya samaj se pare he
 Jio has issued a statement following trai's order
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘jeeyo TRAI ke suzav ko puri tarah se lagu karne ke paksh main he or agal kuch dinon main company teen maheene tak ke liye die jane vaale compcementry ofer ko waapas lene kaa elaan karti he’24 se 48 ghanton ke baad milanaa band ho jayega ye ofraiconomic times kii report ke mutabik company ke nazdike sutron ne bataaya he ki 24 se 48 ghanton ke andar samar sarprise ke liye registration band kar di jaaegi
 However, till the time of writing the news, many users have told that they are still getting the message of getting summer surprise offer on recharge
 company ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki jin logon ne pehle se samar sarprise or prime sabkripshan ke liye paise die hai unhen teen maheene tak ofer milte rahenge
 Apart from this, the company has clearly written on its website that a summer surprise offer can be taken for the next few days
 samar sarprise ke liye15 april aakhri taarikh thi or aaj 7 april he, yani 8 din bache hai
 Now the company is talking of continuing it for the next few days
 sambhav he 10 april tak sabsakripshan jari rakhi jaae
 Closing the Summer Surprise Offer a profitable deal for Jio! Jio can benefit from this order of TRAI, rather than loss
 kyonki log is elaan ke baad jald se jald prime ofer kii sabskripshan lenge
 Since it is not clear how long people will stop receiving summer surprise offers, people will continue to take prime service in the hope
 company ke mutabik 72 million logon ne prime membership kii sabsakripshan le lee he
 One aspect is that those who have not yet taken a prime subscription, they are expected not to take it even if the last date is April 15 or 30
 samar sarprise ofer khatm karne kaa elaan karne ke baad bhi sabsakripshan kuch dinon tak jari rakhana kya TRAI ke aadesh ke khilaaf nahin he?chalata rahegaa Jio Prime ofrasthshai ke aadesh ke baad bhi yugers Prime Subscription le sakate hai
 Its last date is still April 15
 isamen samar sarprise ofer kii tarah teen maheene tak free data to nahin milegaa, lekin sasta data jarur milegaa
 1GB 4G data will be given every day for 303 rupees
 baharhaal, is faisle duusari telecom companiyon airtel, edia or rcom ke share main oochaal dekhne ko mili hai
 Mukesh Ambani's brother Anil Ambani's company Rcom shares 0 as soon as the stock market opens

 Apart from this, the shares of Airtel and Idea have recorded a boom
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is baat par gahari chintaa jaahir kii he ki sarkaar ke kai vibhaag aapas main hi ek duusare ke khilaaf mukadmaa karke ladate rahete hai
 He said that this also wastes precious time of the court and also affects the functioning of the government
 modi ne kaha ki vah aaj tak is baat ko nahin samaj paae ki jab sarkaar ek hi he to uske vibhaagon kaa aapas main court main jaakar ladane kaa kya matlab he?shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main civil services de par desh bhar se aae hue kareeb 600 adhikariyon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In his school, Modi gave many credentials to the officers and told them that he still has the most golden opportunity to take the country on the path of progress as his government has the necessary political will for a radical change
 modi ne kaha ki civil services main vah log aate hai jinako desh main sabase honhaar mana jaataa he
 Despite this, what is the reason that in the minds of common people, there is 'lack' of 'sentiment' towards officers
 is par aatm chintan karne kii jarurat he
 He said that the effect of good work is seen everywhere
 jaise kashmir main baadh main fanse logon ko bachaane ke liye jab fouj ke log jate hai to vah log bhi us vakt tali bajaate hai
 Even if you throw stones later
 modi ne halke phulke andaaj main kaha ki bahut se log civil services main jane ke liye koching karke yahaan tak pahunche lekin ab unke upar bahut badi jimmedaari he
 In his speech of about 45 minutes, Modi also laughed the officers and gave them deep advice
 modi ne kaha ki system ko badalane ke liye yaa usamen sudhaar karne ke liye sabase behatar salaah vahi officer de sakate hai jinhone is system main lambey samay tak kaam kiya he
 But experience also becomes a burden at times
 kai baar anbhavi officer yah sochane lagate hai ki kisi nae aadmi ko aisa kaam karne kaa mauka naa mili jisase uski vaahvahee ho
 This thinking needs to be changed because the country will move forward only when the good work of one man will be carried forward by another man
 unhone kaha ki nae vichaaron ko badhaava dene kii jarurat he kyonki nae logon main nai urja or nai soch hoti he
 Modi said in a rough manner, in which district, many times officers are very busy today all day
 kyonki vah din bhar phone par lage rahete hai
 He said that he understands the power of social media, but the use of social media should be used by the officers for the benefit of the society and not to cut time or to promote themselves
 udhaaharan dete hue unhone samajhaayaa ki agar soshal media par is baat kaa prachaar kiya jaae kii is din puure shahar main tikaakaran hoga or sab log is main bhaag lene aaen, to yah soshal media kaa sahi istemaal hua
 But on the same social media, if the officer is happy to put his photo with the child while drinking the polio drops, then it is not right

 Rahul Gandhi's speech in the Lok Sabha on the farmers and the language used in it reminds me of the language of the tweeter, the government of Suit Bute, your Prime Minister
 saath hi ek saansad kii tarah bijepi ko fansaane kii koshish kii he
 For Nitin Gadkari in the full Lok Sabha, he says that he speaks from the heart and i praise him, even though Gadkari was not in the Lok Sabha
 isse rahul ne bijepi main andeh failaane kii koshish kii
 Then look at the frame, behind Rahul, young Gaurav Gogoi, Sushmita Dev, Deepender Hooda, Ravneet Singh Bittu and Jyotiraditya Scindia on one side, Tariq Anwar on the other and all these were the cheer leaders of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ke ramlila maidan or loksabhaa ke bhaashan main ek baat rahi ki wo vishay se nahin bhatke
 Even at Ramlila Maidan, he only talked about farmers, did not touch any homecoming or other issues
 loksabhaa main bhi puri taiyaari ke saath aankadon se las chutkiyaan lete hue sidhe pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolaa
 You can question whether it is appropriate to target industrial houses at this time or not, but it is also compulsory to do this for the benefit of farmers and poor
 rahul ne ek aise mudde par sarkaar ko gherne kii aguwai kii he jo bijepi kii dukhati rag he
 In the Central Hall also many BJP mps believe in private conversation that this has tarnished the image of the government and the image of the government is becoming anti-farmer
 abhi tak jo yah kah rahe the ki jameen adhigrahan maamle ke dauraan rahul chuttee par chale gaye hai unhen ab jabaab mil gaya hoga magar abhi bhi yah tay nahin ho paa rahaa he ki rahul kitni shiddat se congress ko lead karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Ramlila Maidan rally has ensured that Digvijay Singh's stature will grow in the coming days as he was conducting the rally
 congress kii badi peedi ne bhi raahat kii saans lee jab manch par motilal vora or antony ko dekha
 Getting a speech from the former Prime Minister was a right step
 tippaniyan So far, it has been happening that Rahul gives a speech on some issue then disappears in the House, he will have to make his presence felt in this session or else BJP will repeat him accusing him of doing item number in Parliament because the item number one in the film The bar comes and then disappears
 yadi congress kaa bhaar unhen apane kandhe par sanbhaalanaa he to unhen apane ko is kaam ke bare main gambhir bananaa hoga
 Enough of the holidays, the start has been good, just continue this style and it will be easy
 bhari loksabhaa main nitin gadakari ke liye kahana ki wo dil se bolte hai or main unki tarif karata hum, jabaki gadakari loksabhaa main the bhi nahin
 With this, Rahul tried to spread suspicion in the BJP
 phir jaraa wo frem dekhie, rahul ke peeche yuva gaurav gogoi, sushmita dev, deepender huda, ravanit singh bittu or ek baaju main jyotiraditya sindhiya to duusari taraf tarik anwar or ye sab rahul gandhi ke chiyar leader bane hue the
 There was a point in Rahul's Ramlila Maidan and Lok Sabha speech that he did not deviate from the subject
 ramlila maidan main bhi unhone keval kisaanon kii baat kii, kisi ghar vaapasi yaa anya muddon ko nahin chuaa
 In the Lok Sabha also, with full preparation, he attacked the Prime Minister directly, taking chuckles equipped with figures
 aap is baat par sawaal uthaa sakate hai ki is vakt audyogic gharaanon par nishaanaa sadhana uchit he ki nahin magar kisaan or garibon ke hitaishi banane ke liye yah karnaa bhi majaburi he
 Rahul has led the government to surround the government on an issue which is the sad touch of the BJP
 central haul main bhi bijepi ke kai saansad nijee baatcheet main maanate hai ki isse sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab hui he or sarkaar kii image kisaan virdohi kii ban rahi he
 Till now those who were saying that Rahul has gone on leave during the land acquisition case would have got the answer now, but still it is not clear how strongly Rahul is ready to lead the Congress
 ramlila maidan kii raily se yah tay ho gaya he ki digvijay singh kaa kad aane vaale dinon main badhegaa kyonki wo raily kaa sanchaalan kar rahe the
 The elder generation of Congress also breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Motilal Vora and Antony on stage
 purv pradhanmantri se bhi bhaashan dilvaanaa ek sahi kadam tha
 The comments abhi tak aisa hota aayaa he ki rahul kisi mudde par bhaashan dete hai sadan main phir gaayab ho jate hai unhen is satr main apni maujuudagi kaa ahsaas karana hoga varanaa bijepi un par sansad main item number karne kaa aarope duhraane lagegi kyonki film main item number ek baar aata he or phir gaayab ho jaataa he
 If they have to bear the burden of the Congress on their shoulders, then they have to be serious about this task
 bahut ho gai chhuttiyaan, shuruuaat acchhee hui he bas is andaaj ko jari rakhen to mushkil bhi aasaan ho jaaegi

 In UP, 32 young leaders of the Samajwadi Party, considered close to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, have passed a resolution saying that they will boycott the celebrations after the SP completes 25 years in protest against the dismissal of some young leaders
