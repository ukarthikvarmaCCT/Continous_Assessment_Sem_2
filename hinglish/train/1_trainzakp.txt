 In the first week of this year, Ajmer Superintendent of Police Rajesh Meena was arrested by the anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) taking money from the accused
 atirikt police adheekshak lokesh sonwal nikal bhaaga tha
 In the 5,000-page invoice submitted by the ACB, the case comes as a major corruption in the Rajasthan Police and the protagonist emerges as a big kingpin
 chaalaan ke mutabik, police adheekshak daftar se lekar thanon ko dalal ramdev thathera chalaata tha
 He used to make decisions about posting of thanedars
 meena khud ko pappu dada or sonwal khud ko loki dada kahata tha
 Many Thanedar brokers called Thathera as Mai Baap and Meena himself used to call him 'ji Spades, Bhai Sahab Dhok (pranam)'
 espi tak maheenaa pahunchane ke liye thanedaar thelewaalon or choron tak se vasuuli karte the
 For the first time, an IPS, an RPS and 11 SHO are caught in a corruption case in the state
 2011 main ajmer aane se pehle meena jodhpur main tha
 At the same time, the relationship between the two was deepened due to the alleged architecture of Thathera
 meena ke ajmer aane par thathera bhi na sirf aayaa balki thanon se vasuuli karne laga
 10,000 to 24,000 from police stations between 1st and 5th
 maheenaa vasuulata tha
 The phone tapping showed that Thetera used to threaten the Thanedars

 There were different rates for the posting / transfer and promotion of sepoys to thanedars

 modi sarkaar kaa puraa focus lagata he in dinon desh ke musalamaanon par he
 On Tuesday, the government decided to end the long-term Haj subsidy for Muslims
 isse pehle usne akele haj jane vaali mahilaon ko badi raahat di thi
 It is also worth noting that two weeks ago, the government succeeded in passing the triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha
 is tarah pichley 33 din main modi sarkaar ne musalamaanon se jude teen ahm kadam uthaae hai
 The opposition is also considering it as part of the political strategy of the BJP
 haj sabsidi khatmaduniya ke musalamaanon kii tarah bharat ke musalmaan bhi saudi arab haj ke liye jate hai
 The Central Government itself bears some part of the travel expenses of Indian Hajis as subsidies
 ye sabsidi unheen haj yatriyon ko milti he, jo haj cameti ke jariye jate hai
 The Modi government completely abolished this Haj subsidy on Tuesday
 sarkaar ke is faisle kaa musalamaanon ke bade tabake ne swaagat kiya, haalanki kuch log isse naaraaz bhi hue
 The Billmody government against triple talaq has pledged to rid Muslim women of triple talaq
 teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar iske liye sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi vidheyak ko 15 disambar ko cabinet kii manjuuri mili or 28 disambar ko loksabhaa ne ise paas bhi kar diya
 However, due to lack of majority of NDA in Rajya Sabha, this bill is stuck
 sarkaar bajet satr main is vidheyak ko dobaaraa paas karaane kii koshish karegi
 While Muslim women appeared happy with this move of the Modi government, Muslim organizations expressed their displeasure over the provisions of the bill
 purushon ke bagaiyr muslim mahilaon ko haj par jane kii izajatamodi sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon se judaa doosraa faisla purushon ke bagaiyr unke haj par jane kaa liya
 Muslim women above 45 years of age will now be able to perform Haj without a male guardian
 isi saal 1300 muslim mahilaayein bagaiyr purush ke haj par jaaengi
 However, this decision was opposed by many maulanas and organizations
 unka kahana tha ki aisa karnaa gaiyr-islamic or sharia ke khilaaf he
 The Modi government is taking swift decisions on matters related to political matters behind the decisions
 iske peeche siyaasi myne bhi nikaale jane lage hai
 This year there are assembly elections in 8 states and Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi sarkaar ke in kadamon se jo sandesh ja rahaa he uske siyaasi phaayde bijepi ko milenge
 The Modi government has given a clear message from these decisions that the government will not bow down to the fundamentalists and will not follow the path of Muslim appeasement
 wo muslim tushtikaran kii bajaay muslim shashaktikaran kii disha main kaam karegi
 With this, the BJP is expected to get the votes of Muslim women, while those of the majority society who were angry with the Congress due to Muslim appeasement, will join the BJP camp strongly due to these strict decisions

 The courts in Indian legal cases take action under the Indian Penal Code
 lekin bharat kaa ek rajya aisa he jahaan bhartiya dand samhita kaa prayog nahin hota
 That state is Jammu Kashmir
 vahaan bhartiya dand samhita yani ipisi kii jagah ranbir dand samhita (arpisi) kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Let's know what is the Ranbir Penal Code
 kya he ranbir dand samhitabharat ke jammu kashmir rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu he
 Also known as Ranbir Code of Conduct
 bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 370 ke mutabik jammu kashmir rajya main bhartiya dand samhita kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Only the Ranbir Penal Code is used here
 british kaal se hi is rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu he
 Actually, Jammu and Kashmir was an independent princely state before India became independent
 us vakt jammu kashmir main dogra rajvansh kaa shashan tha
 Maharaja Ranbir Singh was the ruler there
 isliye vahaan 1932 main maharaja ke naam par ranbir dand samhita lagu kii gai thi
 This code is similar to Thomas Babinton Macaulay's Indian Penal Code
 lekin kuch maamalon main antar he
 Ranbir is not in the Penal Code
 These Laws Section 4 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) explains and addresses crimes committed through computer, but there is no mention in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 153 CAA ke tahat saarvajanik sabhaaon yaa jamaavadon ke dauraan jaan boojhkar shastr laane ko dandaneey aparaadh mana jaataa he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main is mahatvapurn vishay kaa ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 195A of the IPC, if someone tortures someone for giving false testimony or statement, then he is considered to be entitled to punishment, whereas there is no instruction in this regard in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 281 ke tahat jo vyakti kisi navikon ko prakaash, nishaan yaa perak main kaam aane vaale pahiyon se gumraah karata he, to vah sajaa kaa hakdaar he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main aisa kuch nahin he
 Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code deals with deaths due to dowry, but is not mentioned in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 190 ke tahat sarkaar aise kisi bhi vyakti ko sazaa de sakati he, jo sarkaar dwaara amaanya yaa jabt kii gai saamagree kaa prakaashan yaa vitaran karata he
 In this case the Chief Minister has the right to determine the crime
 yah vishesh dhara patrakarita, soch, vichaar or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko buree tarah se prabhavit karti he
 These laws are not in the IPC

 No one speaks against the judges in public nor in the media anyway, but by adding judges to it, a wide variety is being realized
 ye bill paas hua to bagair sarkaar kii anumati ke afasaron ke kilaaf koi exiaar nahin hogi
 If the permission is not given for 180 days, then the court will file an FIR
 180 din lagaakar sarkaar un sabooton ke saath kya karegi, yah bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Meaning you have to wait for the government to erase all the evidence within 180 days, save your officer and do not even give permission, then you will go to court that there can be an FIR in this remaining case
 ghotaale kii khabaron ko baahar aane se har haal main roka jaae, iskaa intazaam kiya ja rahaa he taaki public ko bataaya ja sakaa ki hamaari sarkaar main to ghotaalaa hua hi nahin

 Harsha has written that according to this bill, you cannot also file an FIR through the court against any action of a judge or officer, which he has done during his duty

 Seeing the provision will bring more clarity, but if it is so, will the court also wait for 180 days for the FIR? Will he also first have to ask the government whether to order an FIR or not? Is it being tied up with those activists of democracy who go to court exposing scams and even bring an FIR order? is praavdhaan kaa kya tuk he ki jab tak exiaar nahin hogi tab tak press main report nahin kar sakate hai or aise kisi maamle main naam liya to do saal kii sazaa ho sakati he
 Think of you as a citizen, after this what is your role? kya sarkaar kaa bhajan karnaa hi aapkaa rashtriya or rajkeey kartavya hoga? aise kanoon ke baad press yaa public post kii kya haisiyat rah jaaegi? aap kya kahani likhenge ki falaan vibhaag ke falaan afasar ne aisi gadabadi kii he, kyonki aap likh denge ki samaaj kalyaan vibhaag ke sachiv kaa naam aa rahaa he to yah bhi ek tarah se naam lenaa hi ho gaya

 maaloom nahin ki is kanoon kii aalochana kii ijazat he yaa nahin
 The comments kisi bhi sarkaar kaa moolyankan fliover yaa haive se nahin hona chahie

 Ajay Devgn, Tabu, and Rakul Preet Singh (rakul Preet Singh) have rocked the film De De Pyaar De
 in teenon kii chemistry is film se dekhte hi ban rahi he
 Viewers are also very fond of this film
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki varking de main bhi yah film shandaar kamai kar paati he yaa nahin
 Ajay Devgn (ajay Devgn) film 'de De Pyaar De' is the story of 50-year-old Ajay Devgan who is separated from his wife
 ajay devgan ko 26 saal kii rakul preet se ishk ho jaataa he
 This unique love story flows throughout the boom
 ajay devgan apni is yuva saathi ke saath apni purv patni or bacchon ke paas pahunchataa he
 a strange story begins after that
 pehla half kuch hansaata he lekin duusare half main aisa lagata he ki diarector ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo raita unhone failaayaa he, use kaise samete
 The pace of the film becomes very slow
 screenple bhi behad kharaab he
 If we look at the acting front, Rakul Preet Singh manages to win the heart
 film kii jaan rakul preet singh hai or jab bhi ve screen par aati hai, darshakon ke chehre par chamak daud jaati he
 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgn is not very involved in this role, and in the case of acting, he is seen out somewhere
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed
 haalanki film kaa sangeet jarur mjedaar he, or un songs par rakul preet singh ko dekhnaa vaaki acha anubhav he
 The connection connecting the youth in the film also appears to be missing
 aise main 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' niraash karti he

 Prior to this, Rahul has also made films like 'lamha' and 'mumbai Cutting'
 aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi bani he film 'rais'
 
 
 Kahaani: This is a story of 80s Gujarat where Rais (shahrukh Khan), a school goer and his mother (sheeba Chadha), a junk, live a life of poverty
 haalanki ghar kii aisi halaat dekhakar pehle to rais desi sharaab kaa kaam shuru karata he lekin red padane kii vajah se kaam main aadchan aati he
 The aristocrat then becomes a protégé of the English liquor store (atul Kulkarni)
 dimag kaa tej rais ek vakt ke baad khud kaa dhandha shuru karnaa chahta he lekin iske liye uskaa guru shart rakhata he jiske liye rais ko 3 din kaa time diya jaataa he
 Rais goes to Moses brother to fulfill this condition
 musa bhai, rais kii style se impress ho jaataa he or uski help bhi karata he
 Then there are several twists in the story, on the return Rais starts his own liquor business, then due to SP Jaideep Ambalal Majumdar (nawazuddin Siddiqui) the liquor merchants are acted upon but Rais always escapes
 ab deiring se bhari film ke anjaam ko jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why see this film Shahrukh Khan's powerpack acting and the presence of Nawazuddin Siddiqui along with it makes the film quite interesting
 saath hi film ke baaki sah kalakaar jaise mohammad jishaan ayub, atul kulkarni ityadi ne bhi badhiya kaam kiya he
 The dialogues of the film are already a hit and whistles and applause are played whenever they come during the film
 khaas taur par shahrukh ke phens ke liye puraa paisa vasuul he
 The film's locations, cinematography and background take you back to the 80s and the feel is plentiful
 ection sikvence bhi kamaal ke hai saath hi laila main laila vaala geet bhi kahani main acha mode laata he
 Shah Rukh Khan's dialogues as well as Nawazuddin's style of 'koi kama lekha leen' will be quite popular
 shahrukh ne kirdaar ko kadak banane ke liye bahut hi zyada prayaas kiya he jo screen par dikhaai detaa he vahin navazuddin syrius role main or bhi janchate hai
 Weak episodes: The budget of the film was very strong, but there is something missing while watching
 aisa kuch bhi nahin tha jo nayaa ho
 Mahira Khan was completely expressionless and was the angle zero of romance
 isaki vajah se kai sangs or sikvence niraash karte hai
 The first half of the film is good, but the second half seems to be drained at some places
 jise or bhi behatar kiya jaataa to film or zyada dilachasp ho jaati
 According to box office reports, the budget of the film is said to be around 90 crores and the film is going to be released in around 2500 screens in India

 It is being claimed about this photo that it is a photo of Jawaharlal Nehru, in which he is seen in the RSS branch
 photo ke bare main ye bhi daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki yah behad durlabh photo he
 Along with this photo, the message is also written whether Nehruji was also a saffron terrorist? Many people are also commenting profusely against Nehru by taking this photo

 That is, it became clear from the viral photo that the photo is of Naini near Allahabad and it is from 1939

 Although the photo is black and white, it can be seen that Nehru and all the others are wearing white caps
 aresas kii sthapana 1925 main hui thi or tab se lekar ab tak aresas kii dress main lagaataar badlaav hota rahaa he
 But since the inception, the color of the RSS cap is still black and has never changed

 court ne bina ijaajat chunavi raily karne par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue ieneldi ke mukhiya ko notice bheja he or nijee taur par court main pesh hone ko kaha
 Significantly, the CBI appealed for the cancellation of Chautala's interim bail in violation of bail conditions in the JBT teacher recruitment scam case
 is arji par sunwaayee karne ke baad dilli hoicourt ne notice jari kiya
 At the hearing, the court said that this type of behavior is a matter of messing with the law process
 aapako bataa den ki sibiai ne apni apil main kaha ki chikitsa aadhaar par antarim jamaanat hasil karne vaale INLD ke netaa jamaanat sharton kaa ulanghan karte hue haryana vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai

 On his Facebook page, a video of his address has been shared in the Virat Mahasammelan of the backward people organized under the aegis of Social Justice Sangharsh Morcha
 is video main unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par joardaar hamalaa karte hue unpar rajd ko or bihar kii janata ko dhokhaa dene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He also targeted the central government and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi on issues like recession and reservation
 apane is sambodhan ke ant main unhone 'nitish hataao bihar bachaao' ke naare bhi lagavaaye
 Earlier, Tejashwi Yadav had made two tweets on his official Twitter account, in which he had first addressed Nitish Kumar in the name of 'rumor Mahashi' and then the failure of Nitish government to accept its failure to declare Bihar as a poor state
 Where was she tejasvi ne susheel modi ko 'sabase bada kutark master' bataaya tha
 He took a dig at Sushil Modi that his absurd mischief means that the youth will not get scared and get a job in the next 30 years
 tejasvi yadav ne apane pehle twit main nitish kumaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa tha, '15 saal raaj karne ke baad bhi afawaah mahashay kah rahe hai ki bihar garib rajya he
 Nitish Sarkar himself is giving his own oral testimony of his rampant failure by accepting failures
 bihar main logon ko nun-roti naseeb nahin ho rahi he or ye mahoday tivi par biscuit-kek khaane kii parikthaayen suna rahe hai
 After this, in the next tweet, Tejashwi wrote, 'bihar's biggest sophomore master Sushil Modi ever says there is a recession due to sawan-bhado

 The actress, who has made headlines in the country due to her dress and costumes, does not let any opportunity to attract the attention of the Sahrawatal people
 kaan main chal rahe 62wein film mahotsav ke dauraan bhi unhone is maukey kaa bakhubi phayda uthaaya or sabhi kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa
 Mallika has once again shocked people with her shocking dressing
 saamne se ek simple blike dress lekin jaise hi mallika mudin to logon ko chaunkaa diya
 In fact, during the festival, Mallika, who arrived at the premiere of the film 'pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides', was wearing a dress that showed her buttocks
 unki is poshaak kaa aisa asar hua kii ek taraf jahaan log hollywood adaakaar johny dep ko apana pyaar bharaa sandesh de rahe the vahiin cameraman dep ko chhodkar mallika kii tasviir utaarne main lage hue the
 Mallika came here for the screening of Pirates of the Caribbean, and her plans came to fruition here

 The last time Mallika felt a sensation by wrapping a 15-foot python around her neck
 tab wo apni film hiss ko pramot karne ke liye 100 kilo ke ajgar ko lekar pahunchi thim
 You will remember Mallika's skirt before that
 myth ke premier ke liye kans pahunchi mallika acchhee tarah se jaanateen thim ki wo duniya ke sabase mashhoor superstar jaiki chaiyn ke saath hai
 The world will see her, and the world not only saw her but also mentioned them and the reason was Mallika's worn skirt
 ab ye ghaghare kii gustaakhee thi yaa phir mallika kii beficri, jo bhi thi, mallika ne surkhiyaan khub batorin
 After Article 370 was neutralized from Jammu and Kashmir, more opposition from India is taking place in Pakistan
 pakistan is sambandh main bharat par antarrashtriya str kaa dabaav banane ke liye lagaataar koshish kar rahaa he
 After continuous pleading with Pakistan, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is going to hold a close door meeting on Kashmir issue on Friday
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) ab shuukravaar ko kashmir masale par ek close door baithak karne ja rahi he
 In the close door meeting, India's first week of this month (august 5) will discuss the removal of Article 370 from its constitution and the withdrawal of special state status from Jammu and Kashmir
 media reports ke mutabik, sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke adhyaksh joana raconaka ne patrakaron se buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah band daravaajon ke peeche jammu-kashmir ke mudde par 16 agast ko charchaa karenge
 pakistan-china wrote the letter This news came to light when Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Tuesday night that he has written a letter to the President of the UN Security Council on the Kashmir issue
 paak videsh mantri kuraishi ne kashmir masale par patr likhte hue anurodh kiya tha ki is maamle par turant ek apatkaalik baithak bulaai jaae
 At the same time, Pakistan's friend China also accepted this demand and demanded a meeting with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 baithak main china ne jammu-kashmir masale par pakistan kii shikayaton ko suni jane kii baat kahi he
 This letter has been officially written to Poland on behalf of China
 yuanessi main poland agast maheene kaa council chairman he, isliye kisi bhi baithak ko bulaane ke liye uski manjuuri jaruri he
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi said that Pakistan would not sit silent if India maintains an aggressive attitude like this
 anuchhed 370 par faisle ke baad haal hi main bhartiya videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar also went to China, where he clarified India's position on Jammu and Kashmir by holding bilateral talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Li
 jaishankar ne tab saaf kaha tha ki bharat ne jo faisla liya he vah uskaa aantarik maamla he or isse naa china-naa pakistan kisi kii seemaa par asar padataa he
 Then China agreed likewise
 haalanki ab china palatate hue yuanessi main masale par charchaa ke liye patr likh daalaa
 Qureshi admitted - not getting support
 Earlier, Shah Mahmood Qureshi admitted that he was not getting success in campaigning against India on Kashmir issue at international level
 bakreed ke maukey par paak adhikrut kashmir (pok) ke mujaffarabad main kuraishi ne kaha tha ki hamen moorkhon ke swarg main nahin rahanaa chahie
 Pakistanis and Kashmiris should know that nobody stands for you
 aapako jaddojahad kaa aagaaj karnaa hoga
 On Bakrid, Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi said that no one in the United Nations stands with defeat, we have to fight for it
 yuanessi ke 5 sthaayee sadasyon main se ek bhi hamaare khilaaf ja saktaa he
 From Pakistan to China, the US tried to do this issue in its favor, but it was not heard
 pakistan ne apane kareebi dost china se bhi guhaar lagaai or vahaan bhi niraashaa hi haath lagi
 The US has also made it clear on the issue that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is a bilateral issue and the US is not going to mediate in it
 saath hi jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane ko america ne bharat kaa aantarik maamla qaraar diya
 Pakistan also went to the UN Security Council, saying that India violated UN rules
 lekin use vahaan se bhi berang lautnaa padaa, kyonki yuanessi ne is faisle ko bharat kaa aantarik masalaa bataaya
 Not only did the IOC give the same, the IOC (OIC) of Muslim countries also called the issues of Jammu and Kashmir an internal matter
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha tha ki duniya ko yah sthiti samajhaana aasaan nahin he, kyonki kai deshon ke bharat main nivesh hai
 Therefore, people of Kashmir and Pakistan should not consider this mission easy
 ab tak har ore se pakistan ko kashmir masale par bharat ko chunauti dene kii ranneeti naakaam hui he
 Now the issue of Kashmir is going to be discussed in the UNSC close door meeting, but the way the global response has come so far and India has worked within the scope of the constitution, it seems that Pakistan has to face the problem here too
 Will fall
 kai din se bukhaar he
 
 
 Not getting picked up 
 
 puraa sharir dard ho rahaa he
 
 
 Most of the friends and relatives are found saying these days
 offis main kaam kaa boj bhi isliye bad jaataa he kyonki saath kaam karne waalon main se kai biimaar hai
 Chikungunya has taken the form of an epidemic and so far it has caused five deaths in Delhi alone
 marijon kii sankhya har roj bad rahi he or aspataalon main log khadey-khadey glucose kii bottle chadhva rahe hai
 Hi-taaba is overcrowded to get a bed
 chikangunia ne logon ke dilon main dar bitha diya or isaki ek bahut badi vajah ye he ki logon ko is beemaari ke bare main puri jaankaree hi nahin he
 People do not know that Chikungunya can be treated better at home
 doctor kii salaah lekar ghar par rahete hue bhi is beemaari se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Identifying the most important is: 1
 tej bukhaarchikangunia ke shuruaati lakshanon main se ek he tej bukhaar hona
 Fever in Chikungunya ranges from 102 ° c to 104 ° C
 bukhaar haftebhar yaa das dinon tak bhi bana rah saktaa he
 2
 jodon main tej dardjodon main tej dard hona, is beemaari kaa ek pramukh lakshan he
 There is severe pain in the joints due to which there is also difficulty in movement of hands and feet
 ye dard kaaphi dinon tak bana rahata he
 Some people experience joint pain as well as swelling
 3
 It is not necessary to have rashes or rashes, but everyone has rashes or rashes on their body, but some people also see such symptoms
 ye chakatte chehre par, hatheli par or jaanghon par najar aate hai
 4
 anya lakshantej sir dard, mansapeshiyon main khinchaav or dard, chakkar aana or ulti mahasoos hona bheeis beemaari ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 If these symptoms are seen, then firstly get a blood test done from a good lab and get the report checked at the right place
 kya hai bachaav or upachaar ke tareeke:chikangunia virus janit beemaari he or ye infected Aedes machharon ke kaatane se failata he
 In such a situation, it is most important to avoid mosquito bites
 apane aas-paas safai rakhen
 Wear full clothes and be alert
 homeopeth main eupatperf 200 naam kii ek dawa he
 This medicine reduces the risk of getting chikungunya
 aspataal jane kii jarurat nahin, ghar par rahete hue bhi ho jaaenge thikamtaur par logon ko lagata he ki chikangunia ho jane par aspataal janaa hi ekmaatr upaay he
 but it's not like that
 doctor ke sampark main rahanaa jaruri he lekin ghar par rahete hue bhi is beemaari se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Only a little caution and information is needed
 kya karnaa chahie
 
 
 1
 chikangunia kii koi spacific medicin uplabdh nahin he
 In such a situation, take only the medicine given by the doctor
 khud se ilaaj karne se bachein or koi bhi dawa na khaaen
 There is also no vaccine available for this virus
 2
 Stay at home and relax as much as possible
 is dauraanaraam karnaa sabase zyada jaruri he
 3
 chikangunia main aksar logon ko di-hydration kii shikaayat ho jaati he
 In this case, take maximum liquid
 liquid diet lenaa bhi phydemand rahegaa
 4
 agar aap kisi duusari beemaari ke liye bhi dawa le rahe hai to apane doctor ko uske bare main jarur bataaen
 Taking two types of medicines simultaneously can also be dangerous
 5
 Take more and more of the things that get vitamin C
 vitamin si immune system ko boost karne kaa kaam karata he
 6
 bahut adhik oili or spisi khaane se parhez karen
 7
 nariyal pani or subjiyon kaa soup jarur len
 During this time the body becomes very weak, in such a situation it serves to give liquid diet energy
 8
 Wrap the ice pack in towels and place it on the joints and press with light hands
 isse dard main phayda hoga
 Though it can be cured by staying at home with the right care, but during the illness, stay in touch with the doctor
 agar lage kii sthiti sanbhalane ke bajaay bigadati hi ja rahi he to der bilkul na karen

 He also said that it takes some time to experience
 thodaa intjaar kiijie
 Speaking to NDTV, Tejashwi Yadav said that i am working for the development of the state
 kisi ko number dena meraa kaam nahin he
 On one hand, the BJP is bent on proving Tej Pratap as a weak minister, on the other hand, Tej Pratap is constantly attacking him and attacking him for the health of the state
 tippaniyan BJP says that only 30 percent of the doctors in the state are engaged in health services
 rajya ke aspataalon main bistar or dawaaon kii kami he
 When the bill was laid on healthcare in the Legislative Assembly, it was not allowed to be discussed
 ab bijepi kaa kahana he ki tej pratap ko bachaane ke liye yah sab kiya gaya
 Bihar minister Alok Mehta says that Tej Pratap has consistently shown his presence in the assembly

 Now BJP says that all this was done to save Tej Pratap

 tel kii badi keemton or rupee main lagaataar aa rahi giravat par jahaan samoochaa vipaksh modi sarkaar ko gher rahaa he, vahiin ab yoga guru babaaramdevne bhi is masale par sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue chutki lee he
 In the special talk of Aaj Tak, Baba Ramdev said that the condition of the rupee has become such that shame should be brought to shame
 saath hi baba ramdev ne ye bhi kaha ki desh kii arthvyavastha majboot hogi to rupaya bhi majboot hoga
 He replied to the question of Vijay Mallya and said that the governments created a demon in the country, who later left the country and fled
 patanjali ke bazaar main aane se kisaanon ko phaaydaramdev ne kaha ki bharat vishwa kaa sabase bada doodh utpaadak desh he, iske baavjood yahaan kisaanon kii haalat main sudhaar nahin hua
 Earlier, cow rearing people used to get less value of milk and ghee
 gaay ke doodh se banane vaale utpaadon ko gaurav dilaanaa, usase kisaanon ke jivan main samruddhi laana or kisaanon ko sahi mulya dilaanaa hamaara lakshya he
 After Patanjali's milk came to the market, farmers and cow farmers started giving milk to other companies by increasing the price
 teen phaaydon ke liye is kshetra main aae ramdeounhone kaha ki main teen chizon ke liye is kshetra main aayaa
 The farmers should benefit, the people who use milk products should benefit and the country should benefit
 desh ko shuddh chijen milen
 Whatever benefit will be gained from this will also be for the country
 main upkaar ke liye kaam kar rahaa hum
 Mother Dairy and Amul are scared of my products coming on the market and have started threatening them
 bharat kaa bazaar duniya kaa sabase bada bazaar he
 i want that India's money should remain in India and whatever money comes from it can serve the poor people of the country
 'rupee kii aisi beijjati hui ki shame ko bhi shame aa jaae'ramdev bole, 'raajnneetik dal kehete hai ki desh ko aage badhanaa he lekin desh aage badhegaa kaise jabatak desh ke jidipi main vruddhi nahin hogi
 He said that the rupee has been very insulted
 beijjati bhi aisi ki shame ko bhi shame aa jaae
 Ramdev said that the country's economy should be strong
 rupee ko majboot karne ke liye hamen kuch saadhan apnaane padenge or desh kii arthvyavastha majboot hogi to rupaya bhi majboot hoga
 China occupies 70 to 80 percent of the world market
 ek samay tha ki bharat kaa duniya ke 25 fisadi bazaar par kabja tha, aaj 1
 We are in 5
 kya aap par bank lone he iske jawaab main ramdev ne kaha ki maine bank lone liya tha jise chukaa diya he
 Ramdev said, 'why did the word industrialist look bad to be rich', Ramdev said, in response to this, Ramdev said that the Communists looked at being rich in India and they saw people as rich Raged against mana ki kuch amir bhrasht hai to kya communiston main bhrasht log nahin hai
 There are wrong people in every field, but due to some, you start calling the entire group as thieves, it is regrettable
 yah sirf bharat main hi he
 This is not the case in the rest of the world
 'ramdev ne kaha ki bharat main pehle to communiston ne bedaa gadak kiya, phir jo bhi raajnneetik dal aata he wo kahata he ki bharat main amir bahut kam hai, jo garib hai unka vot lo or amiron ko gaali do
 The government collects taxes from them, the parties also collect donations from them, the country's roads, airports and military weapons are purchased from them
 puraa desh unheen se chalata he lekin paise ko or paisevaalon ko gaali di jaati he
 He said, 'babas of the country have fiercely abused Dhan and Lakshmi and have committed a great crime
 inhone kaha ki paisa to haath kaa mile he
 People of Left and Right together said that there should be only poor people in the country
 amiron ko gaali do or thoko
 These people have considered abusive to be rich
 ''sarkaar ne maalya jaise rakshas ko paidaa kiya, phir wo desh chhodkar bhaag gaya'vijay maalya ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki maalya ke maamle main kai log katghare main aaenge
 When Mallya became a member of the Rajya Sabha, the people who supported him, when the losses were happening, then the losses could not be replenished
 uske baad jab ye pataa laga ki maalya diwalia ho chukaa he or uske baavjood bhi madad jari rakhi gai, uske liye koun log jimmedaar hai
 Then how did they run? It seems to me that a demon was born and then that demon fled the country
 is maamle main vartmaan sarkaar ko thodi or sanjidagi baratani chahie thi
 There has been an error somewhere
 'neerav or chokasee ke kaaran anya vyapaariyon ko bhi apradhi samajha jane laga'neerav modi or chokasee ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki desh main aarthik araajaktaa kaa maahaul he
 Due to some dishonesty, even good people are having difficulties in doing their business
 do-chaar karod se lekar 10-20 hajaar karod tak ke vyapaariyon ko is aarthik araajaktaa kii vajah se samasya he
 They are now seen as criminals
 desh ke halaat thik nahin- ramdeoramdev ne kaha ki aarthik ke saath-saath desh main raajnneetik araajaktaa kaa bhi maahaul bana hua he
 Which man is closer to whom
 kisi se bhi milo to thappa lag jaataa he
 Now whoever is in government will have to say hello
 in sabake bich saamaajik araajaktaa or jatigat unmaad bhi ek samasya he
 This is being done by some people
 pichley 1500 saalon main samaaj ke kamjor tabakon par julm hua
 But why are the people being punished for the crime of ancestors today
 aaj ke maahaul ke dekhte hue main kah saktaa hum ki desh ke halaat thik nahin he
 Therefore, it would be good to get rid of hatred
 'rahul ab raajnneeti main mehnat karne lage hai'rahul gandhi ke kailash yatra par ramdev ne kaha kiraahul gandhiaajkal vyaayaayam ke alaava raajnneetik rup se thodi mehnat bhi kar rahe hai
 Ramdev said that i had also said earlier that this country is not the property of any one family
 lekin maine us samay bhi kisi ek vyakti ko target nahin kiya tha
 Therefore, we should not be hostile towards anyone in private
 'bhartiyata se nafrat karte hai kuch dal, modi acchhee niyat se kaam kar rahe'piem modise ummiido ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki kalaadhan, bhashtachar, vyavastha parivartan, samaajik aarthik nyaay kii baat karen to kuch khaas tarah ke raajnneetik dal hai to bhartiya samskruti or sabhyataa or bhartiyata se hi nafrat karte hai
 However, in a sense, the people of the country are satisfied that this government is not opposed to India and Indianism at least
 baaki anya kshetron main piem modi acchhee niyat se kaam kar rahe hai

 The dreaded terrorist Abdul Karim Tunda is a 'family'
 uski teen biviyaan or saat bachche hai
 All her wives live in Pakistan
 dilli police sutron ne bataaya ki tunda ke anusaar, uske sabase bade bete kii aayu 48 saal he
 He went missing a few years ago
 vahiin uske sabase chota betaa maatr saadhe 3 saal kaa he
 According to investigators, Tunda told him that his third son Abdul Waris from his second wife Mumtaz was involved in a terrorist incident in India
 jammu kashmir police ne use ek baar giraftaar kiya tha
 a police officer said, 'tunda has claimed that the heir was also an active member of lashkar-e-taiba
 usne ek bhartiya jail main 8 varsh kii sajaa kaati or uske baad pakistan lautaa
 Police sources said Tunda's three wives Zarina, Mumtaz and Asma live in Lahore with six children
 uske putr lahore or karachi main uskaa dhandha sambhalate hai
 The official said, 'tunda first married Zarina in 1964 at his ancestral place in Ghaziabad
 varsh 1984 main jab vah kaam kii talash main ahmedabad gaya to usne mumtaj se vivaah kiya
 Her third wife Asma was 18 years old when she married him in 1995 in Bangladesh

 So far seven people have been arrested in this case
 rigerv bank kii is ghoshnaa ke baad ki 2005 ke pehle ke note nahin chalenge, karodon rupee ke note har roj badale ja rahe hai
 But the interesting thing is that this has led to the business of those who run note exchange shops in an unauthorized manner
 aarthik patr da iconomic times ne khabar di he ki mumbai main aise agenton ke paas is samay note badalane ke icchhuk logon kii bheed lagi hui he or karodon rupee ke note har roj badale ja rahe hai
 These agents do the work of exchanging notes by taking commission and usually people take them with mutilated notes
 ye kuch kamishan lekar note badal dete hai
 According to the newspaper, there are many such shops in the streets of Jhaveri Bazaar in Mumbai
 inke alaava upnagar mulund main bhi kai dukaane hai or ye sabhi jabardast bijness kar rahe hai
 Actually, people are feeling that the government wants to trap those possessing black money on this pretext
 isliye aisa sochane vaale log bainkon main na jaakar in dukaanon kii sharan main ja rahe hai
 Although Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has described it as baseless, there is fear among people and they are coming to these shops
 ek dealer ne bataaya ki hamaare paas to aise log bhi aa rahe hai jinke paas 2005 se pehle jari 10 se 20 lakh rupee tak ke note hai
 We are changing their notes but taking more commissions from them than before
 pehle jahaan ek lakh rupee ke note badalane ke liye 500-600 rupee kamishan liye jate the vahiin ab ye agent 900 se 1,000 rupee tak lete hai
 Another agent told that in reality these people have shortage of time and they cannot go to the bank, so these people have resorted to these agents
 us agent ne kaha ki ham ek varsh baad bhi in noton ko lete rahenge kyonki us samay bhi ye note valid rahenge
 Most of the note-changers are groceries, restaurant owners, real estate agents, etc
 who hold more cash
 inkaa kaam hi aisa he ki unhen nakad kaa istemaal karnaa hota he
 Now they want to exchange notes safely
 dilli main indian bank sahit kuch bainkon ne puraane note badalane kaa abhiyaan chalaaya he
 They are not only taking notes before 2005, but also taking mutilated notes

 gaay ke doodh main lagbhag wo sabhi paushtik tatv paae jate hai jisaki hamaare sharir ko aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But do you know that the nutritional value of milk depends on the behavior of the cow? If you want to drink more nutritious milk, first of all make sure that the cow you are drinking milk is happy or not
 agar ye baat sunakar aapako hansi aa rahi he to aapako bataa den ki ek adhyayan main ye baat sabit ho chuki he
 a recent study has said that when the cow is happy, it gives more nutritious milk and its milk also has higher calcium levels
 yah shodh 'jarnal of endocrinology' main prakashit kiya gaya he
 Demand for nutritious milk and other milk products has increased rapidly, but fast-growing demand has to bear the brunt
 is vajah se deyari main paali jane vaali zyaadaatar gaayon main calcium kaa level kam paaya jaataa he
 Under the leadership of Laura Hernadies of the University of wisconsin-medicine, US, the relationship between the intake of the serotonin responsible for happiness and the nutritional value of milk was studied

 The Delhi High Court overturned the sentence of life imprisonment and acquitted the accused in the case of rape and murder from a woman of 60 years
 aaropee mrit mahila ko maa kahkar bulaata tha
 In this case, the trial court sentenced the woman to life imprisonment in the case of forced sex and murder
 nyaayadhish pradeep nandrajog or mukta gupta kii bench ne kaha ki postmortem report se yah sabit ho gaya he ki mahila ne sambandh banane se pehle badi maatra main sharaab kaa seven kiya tha
 The bench said, "if Achilal is guilty of the crime of rape, then he cannot be called an accused of murder, because he had no such intention nor did he know that such a relationship could lead to death of the woman
" 'adaalat ne iske saath hi achche laal ko rape ke aarope se bari karte hue kaha ki ipisi kii dhara 376 ke tahat mahila kii umr 60 saal se adhik thi or yah rajonivritti kii samay seemaa se zyada he
 On this basis, Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Mukta Gupta acquitted the accused accused, Goodmanlal (49)
 isse pehle nichalndalat ne achchhelalko doshi maanate hue sajaa sunai thi
 Responding to the court's decision, senior advocate Vrinda Grover questioned
 unhone kaha ki aakhir kis aadhaar par court is nattejey par pahunchi ki yah rape kaa maamla nahin he
 How is menopause related to this? gauratlab he ki rajdhani dilli main 16 disambar 2012 kii ghatana ke baad desh main rape se jude kanoonon main bade badlaav kiye gaye
 But this decision of the court is surprising
 court ne apane faisle main kaha ki dhara 376 ke tahat mahila ke saath jabaran sambandh dand yogya he
 But in this case the age of the woman is between 65 and 70
 yani vah rajonivrutt ho chuki he
 In this case, the relationship formed can be aggressive, but it cannot be called a forced relationship
 court kii in daleelon se spasht he ki agar koi mahila rajonivrutt ho chuki he to use dushkarm peedit nahin mana ja saktaa

 It seems that most of the intruders from across the border are not aware of the security establishment located in the valley

 Police officials also admit that this has led to confusion and delay in identifying the Jaish terrorists killed in recent encounters

 Later Jaish released a picture of the slain terrorists on the social network
 teenon aatankiyon main se raashid or ubaid (donon pakistani) ko jaish commander or tisare hilaal ahamed ko sthaneey kashmiri bataaya gaya
 This reveals another reality: Rishu Jaish has been successful in recruiting many local 'trusted' people in the valley as its 'eyes and ears'

 Mirwaiz has been called by the NIA for questioning again on Tuesday
 pichley do saman par mirwij suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue aane se inkaar kar diya tha
 According to sources, Mirwaiz answered several questions from officials
 abhi bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab baaki hai
 According to NIA officials, Mirwaiz has shown satisfactory response to a number of questions, showing a supportive attitude
 philhal mirwij kii giraftaar par abhi kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Mirwaiz will be questioned again tomorrow
 isse pehle mirwij ko dilli pahunchane par enie ne suraksha muhaiyaa karai
 Mirwaiz had expressed concern over his safety at the court's headquarters in Delhi
 mirwij ke saath hurriyat conference ke netaa abdul gani bat, bilal lone or moulana abbaas ansaari bhi pahunche the
 The Hurriyat leader was earlier asked to appear at the agency headquarters in Delhi on 11 and 18 March, but he had expressed his inability to cite security reasons
 pichley saptaah jari tisare saman main enie ne mirwij ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Significantly, on 26 February, the NIA team also raided several places in Kashmir in terms of Terror funding, including Yasin Malik, Shabbir Shah, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Mohammad Ashraf Khan, Masrat Alam, Zafar Akbar Bhatt, and Syed Ali
 Shah Geelani's son Nasim Geelani

 On their basis, the NIA is now interrogating these separatist leaders one by one and tightening their grip on them
 desh main burke par bain kii shivasena kii maang par raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 Shiv Sena's ally BJP has also opposed the demand for a ban on the burqa, while AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi retorted and said when will the veil be banned
 AIMIM pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki shivasena kaa saamana hameshaa se popat master rahaa he
 He used to write earlier that he will contest separately to defeat Narendra Modi
 lekin unki party ab saath chunaav lard rahi he
 On the burqa ban, Owaisi said that he should first read the judgment of the Supreme Court
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki yah har kisi kaa moulik adhikaar he
 What is written in Saamna is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct and the Election Commission should take cognizance of it
 yah ped news kaa ek nayaa udhaaharan he
 Owaisi said referring to the veil, what he would say about removing the veil
 agar suraksha ko lekar maamla he to sadhvi pragna or anya logon ne hamalaa karne ke liye kya pahana tha
 Earlier, the bjp's ally Shiv Sena cited a plan to introduce a ban on the burqa by the government of Sri Lanka after the terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka
 hamalon main 250 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Earlier, the Shiv Sena demanded a ban on the burqa in the country as well, citing a plan by the government of Sri Lanka to introduce a rule on banning the burqa after the terror attacks
 shivasena ne apane mukhapatron 'saamana' or 'dopaher kaa saamana' main aaj chape sampadakeey main kaha, 'is pratibandh kii anushansa apatkaaleen upaay ke taur par kii gai he jisase ki suraksha balon ko kisi ko pahchaanane main pareshaani naa ho
 People wearing masks or burqas can be a threat to national security
 'shivasena kii is maang ke saath hi raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 The BJP termed the ban on burqa in India as unwarranted, but BJP candidate from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya, supported the demand

 The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on 1 May declared Masood Azhar, the leader of Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed (JEM), an international terrorist

 For this, China was under tremendous pressure from other permanent members of the Security Council, such as the United States, Britain and France
 china ne isse pehle chaar baar maamle main 'takneekee roak' lagaakar prastaav ko roak diya tha lekin antat bharat ko badi kamyaabi mil gai
 Until last month, China had been reluctant to ban Masood Azhar from UNSC
 pakistan ke is aatanki ko bachaane kii puraani koshish hi doharaa rahaa tha lekin pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ne thaan liya tha ki masood ajahar or pakistan ke aatank par har tarah kii strike honi he
 India decided to lay siege from all sides
 phir chaahe wo sainya niti ho yaa phir kootneeti
 After the Pulwama attack, India launched an air strike on Pakistan's terrorists, while France, America, Britain brought a new proposal to the UN Security Council
 isamen suraksha parishad kii 1267 cameti se masood ajahar par pratibandh lagaae jane kii nai koshish thi lekin is koshish main kam se kam 6-7 baar adnga laga chukaa china phir se vahi karne main laga tha
 China was the only country with veto power among the 15 member countries of the Security Council, which was trying to save Pakistan's terrorist Masood Azhar
 iske liye china thodaa vakt maangane or baatcheet karne ke bahaane bana rahaa tha lekin bharat ne apni kootnithik koshishen nahin chodi or aakhirkaar bharat kii kootnithik takat kaa asar ye dikhaa ki china ko masood ajahar par bain ke prastaav par apni roak ko hataanaa hi padaa
 If Masood Azhar has so far avoided being declared an international terrorist, Pakistan along with China is equally responsible for this
 pakistan ko ye pataa he ki masood ajahar ke antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit hone se us par kya asar padegaa
 He is on the verge of being blacklisted in the FATF, an international body tracking Terror funding
 ab to hafiz said or masood ajahar ke taur par do-do antarrashtriya aatankwaadi pakistan main rahete hai or inke aatanki network ko chaah kar bhi pakistan nahin tod saktaa kyonki ye aatanki khud hi pakistan ne paale hai
 In such a situation, it is very possible that Pakistan gets blacklisted from FATF
 agar wo blaclist hua to uski kaarobaari gatividhiyon par bahut badi chot pahonchegi
 Pakistan will not be in a position to tolerate this

 jaish-e-mohammad ne disambar 2000 main jammu-kashmir ke army cantonment par pehla hamalaa kiya tha
 In October 2001, the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir was targeted by Jaish and then on 13 December 2001 the Parliament of India was attacked

 The dossier has details of all its activities to promote terrorism
 dogier bataa rahaa he ki kaise masood ne haal hi main samudr ke raste bhi jehad kii taiyaariyaan bhi kii hai
 The dossier also mentions the Pakistani move to save Masood
 26 farvari ko balakot hamale ke baad use bahawalpur main ghar main najarband kiya gaya lekin baad main islamabad main ek surakshit jagah par pahunchaa diya gaya
 The dossier also mentions that on the pressure of India, Pakistan arrested Masood on 29 December 2001

 The dossier also mentions that Masood was placed under house arrest in Bahawalpur in 2008 after the Mumbai attack, but the charges were not framed and the Pakistani administration later refused to keep him in custody

 The mystery still remains over Ashutosh's resignation from the Aam Aadmi Party
 sutron ke mutabik 15 agast kii subah soshal media par tyaagptr kii ghoshnaa ke baad ashutosh or party ke rashtriya sanyojashravind kejarivalki phone par baatcheet hui thi, baavjood iske ashutosh ne apana faisla waapas lene se saaf inkaar kar diya
 If sources are to be believed, it is no longer possible for Ashutosh to return to the Aam Aadmi Party
 party se istipha dene ke baad ashutosh philhal himachal main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe hai
 According to information from sources, AAP leaders Sanjay Singh, Gopal Rai and Dilip Pandey have met Ashutosh at his house in Noida
 lekin ye baatcheet bhi puri tarah fail rahi
 Surprisingly, Ashutosh sent his resignation to the Aam Aadmi Party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC) in the month of June this year, but the party leaders are saying that the resignation has not been accepted and attempts to convince Ashutosh Still continues
 aise main sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki wo koun si vajah thi, jisane ashutosh ko party chhodane par majaboor kiya
 The interesting question is also what happened on the phone between Ashutosh and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 kyonki kejariwal ne ashutosh kaa istipha manjuur karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Ashutosh had announced his resignation by tweeting, in response to which Kejriwal also tweeted and wrote that how can we accept your resignation
 ashutosh ne 2014 main aam aadmi party jwine kii thi
 He contested from Chandni Chowk in Delhi in 2014, in which he had to face a big defeat
 iske alaava haal hi main rajyasabha seat ko lekar unke party ke saath takaraav saamne aayaa tha

 15 agast ko istife ke elaan par 'ajtak' ne aam aadmi party ke netaaon se ashutosh kii naaraazgi par sawaal puche the
 Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta was asked if Ashutosh was angry since the seats were decided in the party for Rajya Sabha? Sushil Gupta replied that he (ashutosh) will be angry, i do not refuse but i have nothing to do with this matter
 'vahiin, gopal rairajyasabha tiktan milane se ashutosh kii naaraazgi par kaha tha ki ye bahut puraani baat he, koi naaraazgi nahin he
 Ashutosh's resignation could be the biggest setback for the Aam Aadmi Party ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki 2015 main dilli kii 70 main se 67 siton par jeet ke peeche ashutosh kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Although the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are still talking about celebrating Ashutosh, but the way Ashutosh has arrived in Himachal for holidays, it can also be a gesture for the party leaders

 isliye hamane 'ram' kii jagah 'rong' kaa istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya jiskaa bangla main arth 'rang' hota he
 The reality is that many eminent Bengali writers have been using 'rongdhonu' in their writing for years

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bhaajapa-shivasena main siton ko lekar khinchataan sambandhi bayaan mahaj siyaasi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 It is clear from Modi's miraculous leadership and the 2014 assembly election results, that the alliance with the Shiv Sena is not a compulsion for the BJP
 bhagava dal is baat ko lekar aashwast he ki yadi party akele bhi ladati he to bhi vah 150 se zyada seat apane dam par jeet sakati he
 However, even if she fights in alliance with Shiv Sena, hardly more seats are available in her account as she will have to give more than 100 seats to the ally (shiv Sena)
 siyasat kii is hakeekat ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare bhi jaanate hai lekin party kii praasangikta or cader kaa bharosa banaae rakhane ke liye bhaajapa ke saath seat bantwaare ke mudde par gatirodh sambandhi bayaan dene or dilaane kii ranneeti unke ankul he
 There are a total of 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena, bhaajapa se alag hokar ladi thi
 The party then won just 63 seats
 bhaajapa, shivasena ke mukaable lagbhag doguni 122 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 The BJP had lost just 23 seats with a majority on its own
 lekin 2019 kii sthiti 2014 se alag he or bhaajapa ke zyada anukool he
 The opposition congress-ncp looks more vulnerable than in 2014
 vipakshi dalon ke netaa badi taadaad main bhaajapa main shaamil ho rahe hai
 State Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has become an established leader in the last five years
 rajya sarkaar ne pichley paanch saal main rajya main asantosh ke jitne bhi maahaul bane, usase paar paa liya, or is baat koi bada asantosh fadanvis sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin he
 The credit of the Modi government in the state for neutralizing Article 370 from Kashmir has increased further
 maharashtra bhaajapa ke adhyaksh chandrakant patil kehete hai ki, mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke netritv main endie rajya main 220 se adhik seat jitegaa
 So will the two parties combine with 144-144 seats
 maharashtra bhaajapa ke netaa isse do took inkaar karte hai, vah kehete hai ki, “bhaajapa utane siton par jarur ladegi taaki 145-50 seat bhaajapa khud jeet sake
 "meaning BJP will contest more seats than Shiv Sena? a central BJP leader says that, definitely
 bahut jald hi donon dalon main siton ke mudde par aam raay ban jaaegi
 Sources say that all 288 seats are not being discussed for seat sharing
 bhaajapa jiti hui 122 siton par koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 Similarly, the party is not in a mood to tamper with the 63 seats won by the Shiv Sena
 aise main bache hue 103 siton ko lekar hi baat hogi
 In these 103 seats, BJP can get 65 seats and Shiv Sena 30 seats
 shesh 8 siten chote sahyogiyon ko die jane kii sambhaavna he
 So, will the Shiv Sena and BJP not distribute an equal number of seats in the remaining 103 seats? a BJP general secretary says that this is unlikely

 Even in TV replays, it was unclear whether the ball took the edge of Trott's bat
 tippaniyan Later off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin also argued with Trott when the batsman stood at the bowling end and exited the crease before the off-spinner threw the ball
 aswin gend phenkane se pehle hi ruk gaye or unhone traat ko chetavanee di ki vah krij se baahar nahi nikalen anyathaa vah use ran out kar denge
 While Trott was scoring 43 runs in the second innings of England, he tried to cut the short ball of fast bowler Ishant Sharma, which was caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and it bounced in the air in joy
 dharmasena ne haalanki dhoni or bhartiya team ke anya sadasyon kii apil ko thukraa diya
 Kohli went to the batsman after Dharmasena turned down a credible appeal and spoke to him after which the square leg umpire Road Tucker called the Indian captain Dhoni and spoke to him
 tivi riple main bhi yah spasht nahin tha ki gend ne traat ke balle kaa kinaaraa liya he yaa nahin
 The comments baad main aaf spinner ravichandran aswin ne bhi traat ke saath bahes kii jab yah ballebaaj gendbaaji chor par khadaa tha or is aaf spinner ke gend phenkane se pehle hi krij se baahar nikal gaya
 Ashwin stopped before throwing the ball and warned Trott not to leave the crease otherwise he would run him out
