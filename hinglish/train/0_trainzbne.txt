 There was no answer even in getting the crisis
 lekin vah kabhi-kabhi laaparvaahee kar jate the

 jab raajaguru tiraskaar sehate-sehate tang aa gaye, tab ve apane swabhimaan ko bachaane ke liye ghar chhod kar chale gaye
 Shortly thereafter, Rajguru became a member of the 'hindustan Socialist Republican Army'
 phir unhone nishanebaaji sikhin or behatari nishanebaaj banakar ubharen
 Later he met Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev

 23 march 1931 ko angrejon ne raajaguru, bhagat singh or sukhdev kii desh-bhakthi ko aparaadh bataakar faansee par lataka diya tha
 Only at the age of 22, revolutionary Rajguru laughed and hanged himself
 inke saath bhagat singh or sukhdev ko bhi faansee de di gai thi
 It is considered an important event in the history of Indian freedom struggle
 har saal 23 march ko deshbhar main 'shahid diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he

 Expressing commitment to world trade facilitation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a conversation with President Barack Obama that India's food security concerns should be addressed in the WTO negotiations
 obama se shikhar baithak ke baad sanyukt bayaan die jane ke samay modi ne kaha, dablutio ke mudde par khulkar baat hui
 We support trade facilitation, but at the same time we want our food security concerns to be resolved and we hope that will happen soon
 gauratlab he ki july main jineva main hui dablutio kii baithak main khaadya suraksha ke mudde par bharat ne kadaa rukh apanaaya tha or dablutio ke vyapaar sarleekaran samjhaute (tiefee) kaa anumodan karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Developed countries are under pressure to accept the deal, although they are creating such pressure without a permanent solution to India's public food storage issue for the purpose of food security
 bharat ne kisaanon se nunatam samarthan mulya par khadyann kii kharidari karne or use garibon ko saste daam par bechney ke maamle main dablutio se krishi sabsidi kii gananaa ke taur tareekon main sanshodhan karne ko kaha he
 The current WTO rules limit food subsidies to 10 percent of the total value of food production
 iske saath hi sabsidi kii gananaa do dashak pehle ke mulya par karne kaa praavdhaan he
 India is seeking to change the base year 1986-88 for food subsidy to calculate food subsidy
 bharat chahta he ki sabsidi gananaa main vibhinn pahaluon, jaise mudrasphiti or mudra kii ghatbad, ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aadhaar varsh main badlaav kiya janaa chahie
 It is expected that as soon as India fully implements its food security program, the subsidy figure will exceed the 10 percent limit prescribed by the WTO
 aisa hone par dablutio kaa koi sadsy desh yadi bharat ke khilaaf shikaayat karata he to bharat par baari jurmaana lag saktaa he
 Modi said, the WTO ministerial meeting in Bali has been discussed very openly, India supports trade facilitation
 lekin, mujhe ummid he ki ham ek aisa samaadhaan dhundne main safal honge jo ki khaadya suraksha par hamaari chintaaon ko dur karegaa
 i believe it is possible to do this soon
 baithak ke dauraan aarthik muddon par kaaphi jor rahaa
 Modi said, the President and i talked about our many shared economic priorities
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki bharat teevr aarthik vruddhi hasil karegaa or usamen kaaphi badlaav dikhegaa
 In India, we are not only focusing on policies but also on processes so that functioning in India is easy and productive
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, lagaataar khulaapan or bhartiya seva kshetra kii companiyon ke liye america bazaar main saral pahunch ke maamle main raashtrapati obama kaa bhi samarthan mujhe mila he
 The two leaders agreed to discuss climate change issues and cooperate closely
 yah kshetra donon ke liye hi ahm praathamikta vaala he

 kya chhattisgarh ke sukama main siarpief javaanon par hua hamalaa taala ja saktaa tha? siarpief ne hamale ko lekar grih mantralay ko jo report bheji he, usase kuch aise hi sanket milte hai
 If the attack is true, the CRPF personnel who were victims of the attack did not follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) made for such areas
 sutron ke mutabik report main kaha gaya he ki jawan rod opening ke liye dedh-do maheene se ek hi raste kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 Whereas according to the rules, it was necessary for them to change the way
 naksali khabari kareeb 2 maheene tak siarpief javaanon kii movement ko is raste par trek kar rahe the
 Therefore, he was aware of every action of the soldiers
 itnaa hi nahin, naksaliyon ne isi root par pehle bhi 4 baar ghaat lagaai thi
 Despite this, the CRPF did not take lessons

 isse bhi siarpief ko shaq nahin hua
 In the report, it has been termed as human intelligence failure
 chuttee par the 55 javanareport me kaha gaya gaya he ki jis camp ke jawan naksaliyon kaa nishaanaa bane, uske kareeb 55 javaanon ko ek saath chuttee di gai thi
 This also proved to be a huge lapse as the soldiers trapped in the attack had difficulty in providing timely help
 hamale kaa shikaar hui batalian kii madad ke liye siarpief kii duusari company maukey par pahunch hi nahin pai
 According to the Home Ministry sources, according to the sources, the Union Home Ministry is not happy with the results obtained in these reports of CRPF
 report kii binah par kai bade adhikariyon par gaaj girane kaa khatra he
 The Ministry has asked the CRPF to submit a report of the steps taken to rectify the lapse in this attack within 30 days
 naksali jone ke aiji ye report grih mantralay ko saunpenge
 25 soldiers were martyred
 You will remember that on April 24, in Sukma, Bastar, about 300 Naxalites targeted the road opening party of CRPF
 hamale main 25 jawan shahid hue the
 Naxalites had weapons like AK-47
 in naksaliyon ke saath mahila fiter bhi thim
 The Naxalites also used weapons looted during the attack on CRPF on 12 March

 prakhyat lekhak narendra kohli ne kaha ki sahitya kaa dharm peedit ke paksh main khadey hona he
 On the second day of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' in the 'literature of Religion' session, the legendary narrator Narendra Kohli said this
 unhone kaha ki dharm kaa sahitya or sahitya kaa dharm alag he
 Referring to the Ramayana, he said that the story of Valmiki begins with the cross of Crounch and Crounchi
 nishad vyaadh ne is jode main se nar kronch ko apane baan se maar giraaya jiske baad rishi valmiki ne vyaadh ko shraap de diya
 These are still today in the form of birds or humans
 pidak or peedit aaj bhi hai, atyaachaar karne vaale hon yaa atyaachaar sahane vaale
 But the sage comes in their midst
 unhone kaha ki rishi aaj buddhijivi ke rup main hai
 So is the religion of the litterateur, if he is being tortured, then he has to consider whether he has to fall in the middle
 kai log sochate hai ki main bich main kyon paduun, main kya kar saktaa hum
 But there are some people who think that i will do what i can, even if it is curse, i will interrupt
 sahityakar ko ek asaadhaaran kaam mila he ki peedit ke paksh main or pidak ke khilaaf khadey hon
 There is some other power that says something to the litterateur
 rakshas or rishiyon kaa sangharshaunhone kaha ki rakshas, rishi ko hi kyon khaataa tha, kyonki ve buddhijivi the
 Talking about the story of Ramayana, the apes were actually dalit, deprived people
 unako bauddhik netritv rishiyon se miltaa tha
 The demon does not want backward, dalit, exploited people to get any leadership
 unhone tanj main apni baat kehete hue kaha ki aaj bhi akhabaaron ke pehle ke chaar pej rakshason kii katha se hi bhare hote hai
 He said, 'let us not go after those simple words which cannot become a part of literature nor waste our words for those who are not worthy of it
 'bhartiya kavy main sahitya ke dharm kii baat nahin aati, balki prayojan kii baat aati he
 Yash gets the author, meaning gets to the writer, behavior gets to the writer
 jo samaaj ke hit main nahin he, usko samaapt karnaa he
 Shiva has to end in society, whatever is outside Shiva has to end
 narendra kohli hindi ke sabase charchit kathakaron main se ek hai
 He wrote novels, satire, drama, story, memoirs, essays etc
 in all genres
 unki sau se bhi adhik kitaaben chap chuki hai
 He is credited for starting a poetry novel in Hindi

 ' sansad kii ore se jammu or kashmir ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baantne vaale aitihaasik bill ko manjuuri die jane ke saath hi sattarudh bijepi ne mangalvaar ko agle kadam kaa ishaara diya
 And that is to redefine the constituencies of the entire region
 bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ne india today tivi ko die exclusive intervyuu main sanket diya ki jammu or kashmir main ‘arse se lambit’ parisemen kii prakriya ko ‘sahi pariprekshya’ main kiya jayega
 Ram Madhav said, "we definitely want to complete the delimitation process
" yah bill kaa hissaa he (jise sansad ne paas kiya)
 “currently, Jammu and Kashmir has 87 Legislative Assembly and six Lok Sabha constituencies
 inamen se ghati main 46 vidhansabha kshetra or teen sansadeey kshetra hai
 Ladakh, with one Lok Sabha seat and four assembly seats, will have no Legislative Assembly as a Union Territory
 isliye jo bhi parisemen kii prakriya hogi uskaa focus mukhya taur par jammu or kashmir ke nae centre shasit kshetra par rahane kii sambhaavna he
 Ram Madhav has recently been identified as the man who led the party's policy in Jammu and Kashmir
 bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ne kaha, "ham is baat ko lekar utsuk hai ki parisemen kii prakriya ko sahi pariprekshya main liya jayega
 "ram Madhav's comments came a day after the Modi government took a step to end the special status of Jammu and Kashmir through presidential orders
 haalanki, madhav ne nae centre shasit kshetra jammu or kashmir main nae chunaav ke liye tarikhon kaa kayaas nahin lagaaya
 Madhav said, "the Election Commission has to take a decision on when to conduct the elections
 adarsh taur par, mujhe lagata he ki unhen bhi parisemen kii prakriya khatm hone kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 "the strategy after the abrogation of Section 370: The BJP leader dismissed speculation of a possible unrest in the Valley after removing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone ise mahaz dushprachaar bataaya
 Ram Madhav said, "there are leaders predicting the day of doom for whom Article 370 has been an issue of livelihood
" wo sabhi tarah kii bhavishyavaaniyan karenge
 But celebrations have been going on in Jammu for the last 24 hours and there is an atmosphere of immense happiness in Ladakh
 " madhav ne jor dekar kaha, "ghati se koi vipareet nattejey saamne nahin aae he, vahaan bahut chuppi he
 "according to Madhav, his party will reach out to the common Kashmiris and tell them how the new steps will" benefit "them
 madhav ne kaha, "mujhe yakeen he ki agar un tak sahi sandesh jaataa he to logon ko ehsaas hoga ki bharat sarkaar ne jo kuch bhi kiya he yaa kar rahi he, wo vastav main ghati ke aam logon ko bade paimaane par laabh dene vaala he
 We will definitely try to explain it to the people of the valley
 ”haalanki, bijepi netaa ne saafe kiya ki kisi bhi apriy sthiti se nipatane ke liye suraksha agenciyaan har dam alert par rahengi
 Political arrests Madhav described the detention of former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir - Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah as a precautionary step
 madhav ne kaha, "yah ek aihtiyaati kadam tha
 It is necessary for the government to ensure that no adverse results arise
 raajnneetik netaaon ke liye, aihtiyaati giraftaar ek aam baat he
 i am sure that they will be treated with full respect and dignity
 aisa kuch bhi nahin jise lekar fikr karne kii zarurat he
 No external pressure: The BJP General Secretary dismissed speculation about any "external reason" behind the government's move on Jammu and Kashmir
 madhav se jab poocha gaya ki kya bharat america raashtrapati donald trump ke saarvajanik bayanon se prabhavit hai to unhone kaha, "jaisaa ki apane netaaon ko main jaanata hum, main aapako bataa saktaa hum, modi ji jaise netaaon kii soch yaa faislon ko koi bahari kaaran prabhavit nahin kar saktaa
 On the question of Trump's offering of arbitration in any case, the Government of India made its position clear that no such intervention was ever sought
 ”centre shasit kshetra kaa darza kyon?yah puche jane par ki jammu or kashmir ko centreshasit kshetra main kyon badal diya gaya, unhone kaha ki is kshetra ke bhartiya sangh se purna ekikaran ke liye alag tareeke kaa kadam uthaanaa zaruri tha
 Madhav said, "as of Monday, the opposition argued that Jammu and Kashmir is not like other states of India
 jab yah bharat ke anya rajyon kii tarah nahin he, to ise alag tareeke se deal kiya janaa chahie
 This is what we are doing
 desh ke kisi bhi anya rajya kii tarah ise banane kii prakriya main
 We need to take some progressive steps
 ise baad main kabhi naa kabhi purna rajya kaa darja bhi mil jayega
 "madhav also mentioned the geographical political conditions emerging in the western neighborhood
 madhav ne kaha, "main faisale (centre shasit kshetra) se judaa nahin hum lekin main keval yah anumaan laga saktaa hum ki hamaare desh ke pashchim main ek vishisht sthiti viksit ho rahi he
 The Taliban is emerging again
 dilachasp he ki pakistan ek paksh he, america paksh he, rus paksh he, china paksh he or ham nahin hai
 Perhaps the long-term impact of what is happening in our neighborhood needs to be taken into consideration
 hamen isse ranneetik tareeke se nipatane kii zarurat he
 "madhav also emphasized that the BJP in its current tenure will also move towards fulfilling the promises of Ram Mandir and Uniform Civil Code
 madhav ne kaha, "mujhe yakeen he ki agle teen-chaar varshon main, ham in muddon (ram mandir or samaan naagarik samhita) ko nirnaayak sthiti tak laane kii disha main kaafii pragati karenge
 Madhav said in a pinch-like manner, "probably in 2024 we will have to look for new pillars
 ham apane pramukh vaadon ko puraa karne main sakasham honge jo hamane pichley chah-saat dashakon main logon se kiye the
 "nothing unconstitutional under Modi
 The BJP leader rejected the opposition's allegations that the Modi administration would use unfair means to topple elected state governments
" madhav ne kaha, “ham kisi bhi nirnay amal main laate vakt samvidhan kaa uski puri bhaavana ke saath paalan karte hai
 Whether it was demonetisation, action against Pakistan, action against terrorists or anything else, all these were bold decisions
 wo (modi) himmat or pakke iraade vaale shaks hai
 But remember they have always followed the rule of law
 unhone hameshaa iskaa sammaan kiya he
 We will not do anything that violates constitutional purity, constitutional spirit or against the dignified existence of the Constitution
 ” On the Pakistani army's move to threaten India, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that Pakistan must stop seeing India as the 'biggest enemy'
 unhone kaha ‘agar ham aage badhanaa or tarakkee karnaa chaahate hai’ to padosi desh ke saath sambandhon kii samiksha kerani hogi
 Nawaz Sharif, who was the Prime Minister of Pakistan during the Kargil crisis, also demanded an investigation into the 1999 conflict with India
 unhone kaha ki vah tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke 1999 main kii gayi us tippanee se dang rah gayi the jisamen unhone kaha tha ki kashmir mudde kaa samaadhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sharif said that Vajpayee had proposed behind-the-scenes diplomacy to resolve the long-disputed Kashmir issue and that the process was about to begin but "the Kargil crisis caused a major setback to the effort"
 ’ purv pakistani pradhanmantri or mukhya vipakshi party piemail en ke pramukh navaj sharif abhi sindh praant kii teen divasiy yatra par hai

 Significantly, on 12 May 2007, 40 people were killed in Karachi in an attempt to take out a rally in support of the then Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary
 navaj sharif kii sarkaar kaa parvej musharraf ne 1999 main sainya takhtapalat kar diya tha
 He reiterated the demand for the Army and isi's budget to be placed before Parliament, similar to other democracies
 sharif ne kaha ki unhen is baat kaa sabase zyada afsos he ki vah 1990 ke dauraan shaktishaalee sena ko kaabo main nahin rakh paye
 He said that a resolution passed by Parliament demanding the killing of al-qaeda chief Osama bin Laden during an American campaign on May 2 is the first step towards making Parliament sovereign
 sharif ne kaha, ‘hamen dhanchaagat badlaav kii aavashyaktaa he
 Through this investigation, we have got an opportunity to bring the country on the right path, systematically correct its direction, establish the rule of law and bring all institutions under civil control
 ’unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar abtabad maamle kii javabdehi tay karti he or doshi paye gayi logon ko sajaa detii he to puri duniya main yah sandesh jaayegaa ki pakistani naagarik america abhiyaan jaisi kisi or sharmindagi kii sthiti bardaasht nahin karenge
 Sharif also targeted the recently formed PPP and PML q alliance

 The second Test match of the five-test series between India and England is to be played at Lord's from Thursday and according to sources, Team India can once again take off with five bowlers

 India had given Stuart Binny a chance to play the first Test in the first Test match but due to the pitch this medium paceer could not perform his swing bowling properly

 Penny practiced them with a throw down on a particular line and length
 bhartiya team is tarah ke abhyaas satr se kisi tarah ke sanket nahin detii lekin match se do din pehle yah kaha ja saktaa he ki vah paanch gendbaajo ke saath utarane kii ranneeti par kaayam rahegi
 With this, it seems that Binny and Jadeja will be given preference over Ashwin
 lards kii pich hari dikh rahi he lekin toss ke samay tak uski hariyaali hat sakati he
 As the match progresses, this wicket falls flat and therefore India should not be surprised if India do not make changes in their playing XI
 aise main chotii ke paanch ballebaajon par adhik dabaav rahegaa or dhoni number chah par aaenge
 It is the same with England but their lower order batsmen can bat well

 England batsman Gary Ballance said, 'the pitches are very slow and it is necessary to play with an extra bowler

 Not having an extra bowler, we had to struggle there

 19 janvari ko teen maujuuda mukhyamantri, kuch purv mukhyamantri, endie-1 ke purv cabinet matriyon or ek purv pradhanmantri sahit 22 rajnatik dalon ke netaa kolkata ke brigade parade ground main vishaal 'united india' raily main jute or bhaajapa or uske sahyogi dalon se mukaable ke liye ek nae mahagathbandhan kii neenv rakhi
 West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamta Banerjee, the organizer of the rally, declared, "change, change, change government in Delhi
" sabhi vipakshi dal harloksabhaa seat par bhaajapa ke sabase tagade virdohi kaa samarthan karen
 The Modi government has reached its expiry date
 ''pichley pakhwaade lakhanu or kolkata rashtriya raajnneeti ke taqatvar pratik banakar ubhare
 After the Karnataka assembly elections in May 2018, where Bangalore was presenting the tableau of the Grand Alliance and the foundation of a strong alliance for Uttar Pradesh in Lucknow, the Kolkata rally has laid the groundwork for the grand alliance building
 mamata ne apane udghaatan bhaashan main kaha, ''vibhinn dalon ke kai netaa is manch par hai, aisa lagata he ki puraa desh bhaajapa ke khilaaf khadaa ho gaya he
 Everyone has to come together and we have to support everyone strongly
 samuhik netritv mahatvapurn he
 In West Bengal, almost all the major opposition parties, except the Left parties, Mamata's main rivals, made their presence present at this 'united India' rally
 unhone yah bhi saajha elaan kiya ki aane vaale dinon main duusare rajyon main aisi kai reliyon kaa aayojan hoga
 President of Telugu Desam and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said that they are planning a huge rally in the state capital Amravati
 dilli ke mukhyamantri tathaa aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne bhi 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle dilli main aise hi aayojan kaa sanket diya
 The grand alliance from Karnataka to Lucknow, Kolkata to Amravati and Delhi is planned to shape strong pre-election alliances and post-election alliances in the major states of the country
 kya aisa gathbandhan 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh or deshbhar main game changer hoga? kya lakhanu se kolkata, hyderabad se jammu-kashmir tak aisa koi mahagathbandhan banaaya ja saktaa he jo may 2019 main modi kii aguai vaale endie ko chunauti de?aam chunaav se kareeb 100 din pehle desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan se to yah andaja lagata he
 Are alliances of opposition parties in states a serious challenge for the bjp-led NDA in the imminent election? In the countrywide survey, 60 percent of the people answered 'yes' and only 26 percent answered 'no'
 chunaav-purv paridrishyamahagathbandhan abhi kaayam hone kii prakriya main he or gathbandhan abhi bhi ban hi rahe hai, aise main 'desh kaa mijaajya surveykshan uttar pradesh ke rankshetra ke teen sambhavit paridrishy, samooche desh ke chaar sambhavit paridrishy or ant main chunaav baad desh main do sambhavit paridrishy kaa andaja lagaataa he
 These scenarios are hypothetical, based on mathematical probabilities and estimates of vote and seat share
 uttar pradesh paridrishyaparidrishy 1:yah aaj ke halaat ke maddejar sabase vaastavik paridrishy he
 The BJP has an alliance with its own party
 2014 main isi gathbandhan ko uttar pradesh main 73 siten mili thim
 On the other hand, there is now an alliance between SP, BSP and RLD, which was formally announced on 12 January
 congress tisare morche ke rup main lard rahi he or shivpal yadav kii pragatisheel samaajawaadee party tathaa kuch duusare chote khiladinnon ke saath gathbandhan ke prayaas kar rahi he
 So, given the current situation, the mood survey of the country estimates that the SP-BSP-RLD alliance can win 58 seats with 46 percent vote share
 bhaajapa or uske sahyogi 36 pratishat voton ke saath sirf 18 siton par simat jaaenge
 12 with allies to Congress
 5 fisadi vot ke saath chaar siten mil sakati hai
 Clearly, the SP-BSP-RLD alliance seems to be the biggest beneficiary
 yahaan kyub niyam lagu hota he ki sabase bade khilaadi ke liye vot share ke lihaaj se jyamitiya anupaat main siten hai
 Conversely, Congress can win only four seats with an increase in vote share compared to 2014 and is the youngest player in a three-way contest
 beshak, bhaajapa ko sabase adhik nuksaan he or vah duusare number par aa sakati he
 Scenario 2: If all opposition non-bjp parties form an ideal secular coalition, so that the minorities do not get 19 percent of the vote
 yani sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan main congress shaamil ho jaae
 The BJP and the Apna Dal remain in the NDA as before
 vipaksh ke aise adarsh gathbandhan ke maddenjar dotarafa mukaable main 58 pratishat vot share ke saath vipaksh 75 siten jeet legaa jabaki endie 36 fisadi vot ke saath maatr paanch siton par simat jayega
 Scenario 3: What will happen if all four big parties - BJP, SP, BSP and Congress fight separately on their own? BJP can win 57 seats with 35 per cent votes, SP 16 seats with 24 per cent votes, BSP one seat with 21 per cent votes and Congress four seats
 to, bhaajapa chautarafa mukaable ke baavjood siten or vot donon kyon ganvaati dikh rahi he? asal main centre main modi or lakhanu main adityanath kii sarkaar hone se dohari satta virdohi hawa ke kaaran bhaajapa ko lagbhag 7
 5 percent of the votes appear to be lost
 haalanki, pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri kii vyaktigat lokapriyata kaa vishleshan kiya jaae to rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi centre sarkaar kii tulana main adhik he
 Pre-election scenario in the country Main scenario: According to the current situation this is the most realistic scenario in the country (see article, Combat Thorn)
 iske mutabik titarafa mukaable main endie ko 35 pratishat maton ke saath 237 siten milane kii sambhaavna he; upie (telugudesham, congress or anya ke saath) 33 pratishat voton ke saath 166 siten hasil kar saktaa he jabaki anya (sapa, basapa, trinmul or duusare chote dal) 32 pratishat vot ke saath 140 siton par paracham laharaa sakate hai
 The result: hung Lok Sabha because no one can get a minimum of 272 seats out of 543 required to form a government
 paridrishy 1:agar basapa-sapa-ralod or trinmul, congress kii aguai vaale upie main shaamil ho jate hai, to vot or seat kii sambhaavna kya he? endie 35 pratishat voton ke saath 219 siten jitegaa, jabaki upie 44 pratishat voton ke saath 269 siten or anya 21 pratishat maton ke saath 55 siten jeetenge
 But if this possibility is not real, then why consider it? As the saying goes: 'there is force in unity', the internal competition between the Congress-led UPA and the sp-bsp-rld-trinamool's grand alliance will harm each other and ultimately the situation will be beneficial for the NDA
 paridrishy 2:kya hoga agar annadramuk or viesar congress endie ke saath aa jaaen or mahabuuba mufti kii aguai vaali pidipi upie main shaamil ho jaae? baaki paridrishy bilkul vaise hi hon jaise paridrishy 1 main hai
 The NDA is likely to win 234 seats with 40 percent votes, while the UPA is likely to win 272 seats with 44 percent votes
 spasht rup se, pidipi ke saath aa jane se bhi upie kaa vot share nahin badhata he lekin isaki kuch siten bad jaati hai jo sarkaar banane ke liye aavashyak bahumat ke kareeb pahunchaa detii hai
 Scenario 3: What if Biju Janata Dal led by Naveen Patnaik and K
 chandrashekhar raav ke netritv vaali tiares endie main shaamil ho jaaen? iskaa jawaab bahut uljhane vaala haih inke saath aane se bhi endie ko maamuli laabh hi hoga or vah 257 siten hi praapt kar sakegi
 Both rivals will get 44 percent of the vote, yet the UPA will be in a position to cross the 272 mark needed to form the government
 anya ko 12 pratishat maton ke saath lagbhag 14 siten mil rahi hai
 Clearly, the NDA coalition is facing an anti-incumbency trend, as the UPA had to do in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 matlab yah ki teenon paridrishy main sirf pehle main hi endie ko kuch badhat milane kii ummid he
 There will be two post-election scenarios if there is no change in this pre-election scenario during the next 100 days during the election campaign? Depending on the number of political players in the country and possible equations, a variety of scenarios can be imagined after the election
 samajhane main thodi sahuuliyat or sambhavit paridrishyon ko saral banane ke liye desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main sirf do paridrishyon par vichaar kiya gayamparidrishy 1:agar ham bahut had tak vaastavik mukhya paridrishy ko hi chunaav purv kii tasviir ko hi sahi maane, to 237 siton ke saath endie ko sarkaar banane ke liye 35 atirikt saansadon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 It will need the support of potential allies of the South such as YSR Congress of Andhra Pradesh, AIADMK of Tamil Nadu, TRS of Telangana, formerly BJD of Odisha
 paridrishy 2:agar ham chunaav purv ke bahut had tak vaastavik mukhya paridrishy ko hi sarkaar banane ke liye vyaavhaarik tasviir maanate hai, to 166 siton vaali upie ko sambhavit sahyogi dalon jaise sapa-basapa-ralod se 58 siton ke alaava 48 anya siton kii bhi aavashyaktaa hogi jo use bijd or anya chote khiladinnon ke samarthan se hi mil sakati he
 In such a situation, the pressure of allies on the government will also be high
 labbolubaab yah ki gathbandhanon kaa siyaasi daur laut aayaa he or yah pradhanmantri modi ke liye musiibat ban saktaa he
 With their declining popularity, public opinion polls suggest that the bjp-led NDA may have to fall behind with an absolute majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isane desh ke vipakshi dalon ko apane vaicharik matbhedon ko bhulaakar ekajute hone ke liye prerit kiya he
 But the dilemma of 2019 is also that the NDA, UPA or Grand Alliance cannot form a government on their own
 prayek khilaadi ko kam se kam ek anya gathbandhan ke samarthan kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 In the current circumstances, it would be better for the UPA led by the Grand Alliance and the Congress to try to form a pre-election alliance rather than a post-election alliance
 chunaav purv gathbandhan main rajnatik sthirataa or sthayitv bhi zyada hoga

 a few hours later, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj set the deadline for Pakistan and asked that she respond to the Indian invitation for the meeting by midnight

 jaishankar ne 24 agast ko badi taadaad main pashchimi press ko aamantrit kiya, jabaki pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ne agle din aisa kiya
 It was very important for India to keep its talk to the foreign media because on September 28 in New York, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to meet US President Barack Obama
 ek ore jahaan china ke bazaar ke dharashayi hone se duniya hili hui he, modi shartiya taur par bharat ke asaadhaaran loktantr kii kahani duhraana chaahate hai
 This is a panacea for peace and stability on their part
 lekin modi ko jald hi ehsaas ho saktaa he ki duniya ke unke bade saathi tathaa madhyasth takatein kisi or sankat ko lekar vichlit hai
 Now that the US has pulled out of Afghanistan, the announcement of Mullah Omar's death two years ago and Pakistan's keeping it a secret has only increased America's despair and its dependence on Rawalpindi
 ek saal pehle jab modi satta main aae the, unhen ummid thi ki ve na sirf bharat kii aarthik mahatvakankshaon ko puraa karenge balki dakshin asia ke lambit ekikaran kii aguai karenge
 While Modi's foreign policy ambitions for India gave him a big edge, in comparison, he could not give any message on the issue of Pakistan policy

 So the journey to invite Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony in May last year turned into a cancellation of Aziz's Delhi visit for NSA level talks on August 23-24 as he would also hold meetings with Hurriyat leaders But were adamant
 is sankat kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he jo kam hi log jaanate hai
 This is a silent game of strength between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Sushma Swaraj
 pichley ek saal ke dauraan pradhanmantri kii har badi videsh niti kii pahal main dobhaal unke peeche najar aa rahe the
 But on August 22, when it was the turn of Indian representation to reply to Aziz's press conference, Modi preferred Swaraj instead of Doval
 upree taur par modi kaa chayan sahi najar aayaa kyonki swaraj ne pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya
 But along with his eloquence, Swaraj himself drew the boundary line
 masalan, unhone ek patrkaar ko kaha ki pakistan ke liye jawaab dene kii samaysima 22 agast kii aadhi raat he, “vah samay jab angreji calendar main taarikh badal jaati he
 "but according to an official, he did not get the green signal to" give this deadline
 ” kya swaraj apni brifing kii had se aage bad gayi, is adhikari ne yah bataane se manaa kar diya
 a few days earlier when Pakistan responded on 14 August to negotiate India's proposed agenda, it was a whisper that Pakistan had informed India that Aziz was keen to meet his Indian counterpart as well as Swaraj
 lekin bhartiya adhikariyon ne iskaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Even after Aziz's press conference on 22 August, many believed that despite the dramatic context of meeting or not meeting Hurriyat leaders, he had just kept the door open for the Delhi meeting
 jab ajij se poocha gaya ki kya dilli main dobhaal se baatcheet ke baad unke liye hurriyat netaaon ke saath mulaakaat sambhav he, unka jawaab tha-haa or dobhaal camp ne raahat kii saans lee thi
 So when Swaraj overturned the midnight deadline, it ended the possibility of Aziz's visit
 yah kehete hue ki pakistan ke prati swaraj kaa kadaa rukh pradhanmantri ke nazariye se takaraata he, ek adhikari maanate hai, “sushamaa swaraj ne jo kiya vah modi se bhi thodaa aage badhkar tha
 "the officer also added that Swaraj made a number of mistakes in the press conference, including calling Hurriyat leaders a" third party "
 10 july ko upha main ek saajha bayaan main “jammu or kashmir” ko lekar chute sandarbh kii vyakhya ek bhartiya ranneetikaar “asal dosha” ke rup main karte hai yani “modi team kii upha main aakshamata, jo dushman ko apana cheharaa chhipaane kaa jariya muhaiyaa karaati he
 "it is believed that Modi and Sharif had a good meeting in Ufa
 yahaan tak ki sharif ne in garmiyon main dhaka main modi ke bhaashan ke sandarbh main ek majaak bhi kiya
 There seemed to be an understanding that the restoration of india-pakistan dialogue would help Sharif politically
 iskaa matlab tha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron kii baithak main kashmir vivaad or anya masalon par dobaaraa baatcheet shuru hogi
 But clearly neither Pakistani Foreign Secretary Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary nor Jaishankar felt the need to save the face of the weaker side
 jaishankar kaa isse pehle pakistan ke saath baatcheet ko lekar kabhi sabaka nahin padaa tha
 India had obtained reference to the accused in the Mumbai case without any reference to "jammu and Kashmir" in a joint statement
 bharat ke is vijayibhav se sharif or adhik kamjor padate najar aa rahe the
 They were not able to defend their stand in Ufa after being already isolated from their army
 aise main sawaal he ki ab kya hoga? adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki tay kaarykram ke mutabik 9 sitambar ko biesaf or pakistani rangers ke mahanideshkon kii baithak hogi
 Doval and Aziz are expected to meet in New York in the last days of September, by then the crowd craze will be over
 lekin asal main modi sarkaar ne shaayad apni pakistan niti ko dabbe main band kar ke ek kone main sarka diya he
 ufa's meeting was held in August 2014, 11 months after the Foreign Secretary level talks were canceled
 is baar isamen kitna samay lagegah jab tak pakistan naram nahin pad jaataa yaa unke manmutabik nahin ho jaataa? 68 saal pehle apane janm ke samay hi alag hue bharat or pakistan kya apane puraane kadave naatakeey tamaashe ko baar-baar dohraane ke doshi hai?

 This is the first time since 1933 that the Indian cricket team is playing a Test here and there is no Mumbai cricketer in the playing XI
 haalanki mumbai ke khilaadi shardul thakur team main he lekin unhen antim ekadash main mauka nahin mil sakaa he
 The comments bambe gymkhana main 1933 main hue test ke baad se bhartiya team ne yahaan aisa koi test nahin khelaa he jisamen antim ekadash main mumbai kaa koi cricketer nahin rahaa ho
 Mumbai's Ajinkya Rahane has been ruled out for two matches due to injury while Thakur, who was called as the cover of Mohammed Shami, could not get a chance in the playing eleven

 ek samay aisa bhi rahaa he, jab team india main mumbai ke khilaadiyon kaa varchasv hua karata tha lekin samay ke saath yah sankhya dhire-dhire kam hoti gai
 Since the 1933 Test at the Bombay Gymkhana, the Indian team has not played any such test in which there was no Mumbai cricketer in the last XI
 mumbai ke ajinkya rahane chot ke kaaran baahar do maichon se baahar ho gaye hai jabaki mohammad shami ke cover ke taur par bulaaye gaye thakur ko bhi plaing ilevan main mauka nahin mil sakaa he
 Ajinkya Rahane, who could not do much in the first three Tests of the india-england series, got a ball in the index finger during a practice session and broke his finger
 rahane agle donon hi test main team kaa hissaa nahin rahenge
 Similarly, Rohit Sharma of Mumbai, who is becoming a regular member of the test team, is currently out of cricket due to injury

 The challenge of how to get it done successfully came up
 road sho ke raste kaa pehle nirikshan kiya gaya
 Then after waking up for the whole night on the 13th, District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra and Police Captain Nitin Tiwari got barricading in place
 drone camere se raste main padane vaali har chat kaa jayja liya gaya
 The bomb squad investigated the rumor
 anti mine, snifer dog ilaake kii har sandigdh vastu kii jaanch main jute rahe
 After this, if the crowd does not come forward, 6000 soldiers were deployed in duty by giving about 3 kilometers of rope
 raatbhar kii is kavayad ke baad 14 taarikh kii wo subah aa gai jab piem modi ko aana tha
 Their program was earlier at 12 o'clock and that of CM at 1 o'clock
 aise main root ek hone par aapas main takaraahat lajimi thi
 Therefore, the administration requested the pm's program and got it done at 9 o'clock and the cm's at 2 o'clock
 is prayaas ke baad prasashan ne thodi raahat kii saans lee
 But when the PM came, he set out for a 5-kilometer path to the temple in an open jeep from Lanka Gate of BHU
 piem ke kaarykram kii badi-badi soochna akhbaaron main istehaar de kar chhapi gai thi lihaaja bheed unke swaagat main jute gai
 The people of BJP had also made preparations in advance
 jagah-jagah phulon kii tokari pahunchaai gai thim
 Which was to rain on PM
 piem kaaravaan to aage badha par ye anaupchaarik road sho main tabdeel ho gaya kyonki ek to piem khuli kar main chale or duusare baari bheed kii vajah se chaal dhimi ho gai
 Which took hours to reach the temple
 pradhanmantri modi 1 baje ke aasapaas vishwanath mandir hi pahunche vahaan se puja karke kalbhairav jane main 2 se zyaada bajane laga
 Now the road show of CM Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi has started from the court
 aise main prashasan ke paseene chhootane lage
 For the procession on both sides, the administration had deployed the force
 puure road sho ke raste ko 12 sector main baantkar prashasan ne 13 espi, 12 eespi, 45 sio ke saath police bal kaa saamanjasy dm oe esaspi lagaataar banaae hue the
 Meanwhile, the administration had also made a double arrangement
 alag root bhi banaaya tha ki koi baat hone par viipi ko duusare raste se nikaala ja sake
 However, the big thing between these arrangements was that before the cm's road show came in the way of PM
 piem ke program ko sakushal sampann karakar vidaa kar dene kii thi
 Finally, around 3 pm, the PM Ja program was over, by then the caravan of CM had completed a quarter of the distance
 lekin ab prasashan aadhi ladaai jeet chukaa tha
 But the difficulty was not over yet
 or ek badi chunauti us samay saamne aa gai jab siem or rahul kaa kafila chaukaghat pani ke tank ke paas pahunchaa tab ek bijepi samarthak ke chat par jhanda laharaa rahe logon par kahin se kisi ne pathar phenk diya
 Which caused a ruckus
 laga ki koi anhoni ho jaaegi tabhi police ne sthiti ko badi mustaidi se sambhaal liya
 And a big incident survived
 der shaam ye road sho bhi khatm hua or police prasashan ne raahat kii saans lee
 The comments lekin ye raahat chand ghanton kii hi thi kyonki agali subah to piem kaa tay road sho tha
 After leaving the Pandepur intersection, a 5-km route was to end at the meeting in Vidyapeeth's Maudan
 ek baar phir usee taiyaari ke saath police bal juta
 This program was also not a challenging task for the police, because one of the densely populated and narrow streets of Benares, the pm's going out in the open and the other heavy hoosom which cannot be fully checked
 haalanki ye kaarykram bhi thik se nikal gaya
 On the third day, it became a challenge for PM to go by road to Gadwaghat Ashram and Lal Bahadur Shatri's house
 teen din se thik based aaraam na kar paane vaala prasashan phir ek baar mustaidi se laga or aapasi talmail se is kathin chunauti par bhi par paaya
 And when the PM went to hold his last meeting in Rohania Vidhan Sabha, then the administration of Benaras could breathe a sigh of relief
 is teen din kii kavayad main police or para force ke jawan to lage hi rahe par jile ke jiladhikari or esaspi jis par puure kaarykram kaa daaromadar tha wo in teen dinon main banaras kii 50 kilometre sadake paidal naapi esaspi nitin tiwari ke pairon main chhaale pad gaye or yahi haal dm kaa bhi hua
 But they are happy that such a big battle has been completed successfully
 or agar banaras kii baat kare to banaras ne bhi aaj tak kabhi chunaav main itnaa bada ran samar kabhi nahin dekha tha kyonki chunaav to puure uttar pradesh main ho rahaa tha par asal ranbhumi to banaras kii hi sarazmi bani
 And this happened because the air in Purvanchal passes through Benaras and all political parties put so much power in Benaras to turn this wind on their side, the pressure of Banaras became light
 gauratlab he ki banaras bhaajapa ke mizaaj kaa shahar he
 Three seats in the city are occupied by BJP
 jisame 2 seat kaint or dakshini par to uskaa kabja dashakon se he
 But this time the ticket distribution was such that there was tremendous resentment among the people
 virodh kaa swar is kadar mukhar hua ki uski aag main in donon seat kaa jal jane kaa dar ho gaya
 Preparations began to convince the disgruntled group
 damege control ke liye shahar dakshini se saat baar vidhayak rahe shyaam dev raay choudhary ko bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne dilli bulaayaa
 He was assured of emulsifying and other major political posts
 par tikat katane se aahat dada kaa dil nahin pasija
 So PM Modi himself jumped into the ground
 unka antim teen din kaa pravaas yahaan nishchit hua
 And as the three-day program of PM arrived
 vaise hi police or prasashan kaa sara kaarykram chunauti main badal gaya
 On the first day i

 This program was also not a challenging task for the police, because one of the densely populated and narrow streets of Benares, the pm's going out in the open and the other heavy hoosom which cannot be fully checked
 haalanki ye kaarykram bhi thik se nikal gaya
 On the third day, it became a challenge for PM to go by road to Gadwaghat Ashram and Lal Bahadur Shatri's house
 teen din se thik based aaraam na kar paane vaala prasashan phir ek baar mustaidi se laga or aapasi talmail se is kathin chunauti par bhi par paaya
 And when the PM went to hold his last meeting in Rohania Vidhan Sabha, then the administration of Benaras could breathe a sigh of relief
 is teen din kii kavayad main police or para force ke jawan to lage hi rahe par jile ke jiladhikari or esaspi jis par puure kaarykram kaa daaromadar tha wo in teen dinon main banaras kii 50 kilometre sadake paidal naapi esaspi nitin tiwari ke pairon main chhaale pad gaye or yahi haal dm kaa bhi hua
 But they are happy that such a big battle has been completed successfully
 or agar banaras kii baat kare to banaras ne bhi aaj tak kabhi chunaav main itnaa bada ran samar kabhi nahin dekha tha kyonki chunaav to puure uttar pradesh main ho rahaa tha par asal ranbhumi to banaras kii hi sarazmi bani
 And this happened because the air in Purvanchal passes through Benaras and all political parties put so much power in Benaras to turn this wind on their side, the pressure of Banaras became light
 unka kaarykram pehle 12 baje kaa tha or siem kaa 1 baje kaa
 In such a situation, when there was one root, there was bound to be conflict
 lihaaja prashasan ne pehle piem ke program ko aagrah kar 9 baje kaa karaayaa or siem kaa 2 baje kaa
 After this effort, the administration breathed a little relief
 lekin jab piem aaye to wo biechayu ke lanka get se khuli jeep se mandir kaa 5 kilometre kaa rasta tay karne nikle
 a large amount of information about the pm's program was printed in newspapers, so the crowd gathered to welcome him
 bijepi ke logon ne bhi pehle se taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 Baskets of flowers were delivered everywhere
 jo piem par varsha karne ke liye thi
 The PM caravan moved forward, but it turned into an informal road show because one PM walked in the open tax and the other slowed down due to heavy crowd
 jisase mandir pahunchane main ghanton lag gaye
 Prime Minister Modi arrived at the Vishwanath temple around 1 o'clock and started worshiping from there and it took more than 2 to go to Kalabhairav
 ab kachhari se siem akhilesh or rahul gandhi kaa bhi road sho shuru ho gaya
 In such a situation, the administration started to sweat
 donon taraf ke julus ke liye prasashan ne force tainaat kar rakhi thi
 By dividing the path of the entire road show into 12 sectors, the administration continued to maintain the coordination of the police force with 13 SP, 12 ASP, 45 CO, DM and SSP
 is bich prasashan ne dohari vyavastha bhi kar rakhi thi 
 a separate route was also made so that VIP could be removed through another route if there was any talk
 baharhaal in vyavastha ke bich badi baat ye thi ki piem ke raste main siem kaa road sho aane se pehle
 The pm's program had to be completed by leaving it safe
 aakhirkaar 3 baje ke lagbhag piem ja kaarykram khatm hua tab tak siem kaa kaaravaan ek chauthai duuri puri jaar chukaa tha
 But now the administration had won half the battle
 par abhi mushkil khatm nahin hui thi
 And a big challenge came when the convoy of CM and Rahul reached near the Chaukaghat water tank when a BJP supporter threw a stone at the people waving the flag on the roof
 jisase hangaamaa hone laga
 It was felt that something untoward would happen when the police handled the situation with great urgency
 or koi badi ghatana hone se batch gai
 The road show also ended late in the evening and the police administration breathed a sigh of relief
 tippaniyan But this relief was only for a few hours because the next morning was the pm's scheduled road show
 jo pandeypur chauraahey se nikalakar 5 kilometre kaa rasta taykar viapeeth ke maudaan main sabha par khatm hona tha
 Once again the police force gathered with the same preparation
 ye kaarykram bhi police ke liye kaam chunauteepurn nahin tha kyonki ek to banaras kii ghani basti or sankare raste par piem kaa khule main janaa or duusari baari hujum jise puri tarah check nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, this program also went well
 tisare din phir piem kaa gadwaghat ashram or laal bahadur shatri ke ghar sadak maarg se janaa ek chunauti ban gaya
 The administration, which had not been able to rest for three days, once again felt ready and found itself on this difficult challenge with mutual coordination
 or jab piem apni aakhri sabha rohaniya vidhansabha main karke chale gayi tab jaakar kahin banaras kaa prasashan raahat kii saans le paaya 
 Police and Para Force personnel were engaged in this three-day exercise, but the District Collector and SSP, who was responsible for the whole program, got blisters in the foot of SSP Nitin Tiwari, a 50-kilometer road walk of Benares in these three days
 And the same situation happened with DM
 par inhen kushi is baat kii he ki itane bade ran samar ko sakushal sampann kara liya
 And if we talk about Banaras, Banaras had never seen such a big battle in the election till date because the election was going on in the whole of Uttar Pradesh, but the real battleground became the home of Banaras
 or aisa isliye hua kyonki purvanchal main hawa banaras se hokar hi guzarati he or sabhi rajanithik partiyaan is hawa ko apane taraf karne liye banaras main itani takat jhonki kii banaras kaa prasasham halkaan ho gaya
 Meanwhile, the administration had also made a double arrangement
 alag root bhi banaaya tha ki koi baat hone par viipi ko duusare raste se nikaala ja sake
 However, the big thing between these arrangements was that before the cm's road show came in the way of PM
 piem ke program ko sakushal sampann karakar vidaa kar dene kii thi
 Finally, around 3 pm, the PM Ja program was over, by then the caravan of CM had completed a quarter of the distance

 Which caused a ruckus
 laga ki koi anhoni ho jaaegi tabhi police ne sthiti ko badi mustaidi se sambhaal liya
 And a big incident survived
 der shaam ye road sho bhi khatm hua or police prasashan ne raahat kii saans lee
 The comments lekin ye raahat chand ghanton kii hi thi kyonki agali subah to piem kaa tay road sho tha

 jaanch agency ke vakil tulsi ne daleel di ki magistrate ne apane aadesh main galati kii he kyonki aparaadh kaa sangyaan aise maamle main liya gaya he jisamen aarope patr daayar kiya ja chukaa he

 shah ko hatya, jabaran vasuuli or apharan ke aaropon main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Shah's senior counsel Ram Jethmalani, opposing the CBI remand, argued that the investigating agency had no evidence to arrest his client
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki anya ahm gavaahon main khauf paidaa karne ke liye shah ko giraftaar kiya gaya he

 There are problems all around him
 kisaanon ko suvidhaayen milanaa to dur apni jindagi chalaane ke liye unke paas jo thodi bahut jameen he vah bhi khatre main he

 Appealing to win Congress candidates, Sonia said, "if the Congress government is formed after the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, then it will be a government of all classes including women, Dalits, backward, farmers
" paardarshee shashan kii sarkaar hogi or aapaki vartmaan tathaa nai peedi kii sarkaar hogi
 'he said,' i am sure that you will definitely consider all these things and will give our candidates one by one vote on election day

 The people of West Bengal always take part in elections with great enthusiasm
 2009 ke chunaav main desh ke 58
 81 here compared to 2 percent
 4 pratishat matdaan hua tha
 This time a lot is at stake, in such a situation the election is going to be quite interesting
 abhinetri munmun sen, sangeet nirdeshak bhappi lahidi or jaadugar pisi sarkaar junior ke maidan main hone kii vajah se yah kaaphi rang-birangaa bhi ban gaya he
 By the way, the voters of West Bengal give a clear majority to a party with cleanliness and frankness in terms of their political loyalities
 1967 se 1977 ke ek dashak ko chhod den, jab vahaan loksabhaa ke ti lekin vidhansabha ke chunaav chah baar hue, to pashchim bengal main ek party yaa gathbandhan spasht bahumat ke saath satta main aayaa he or kaarykaal puraa kiya he
 After independence, the Congress ruled here for 20 consecutive years
 uske baad baar-baar badlaav or uthal-puthal vaale dashak kebaad marxvaadi communist party kii aguai vaale vampanthi morche ne 33 saal tak satta par kabja jamaaye rakhaa
 The rule of the Left came to an end in 2011 and Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power by winning 184 out of 294 seats in the assembly elections
 lekin yah jeet congress ke saath gathbandhan ke balboote thi jo ab tut gaya he
 So will West Bengal maintain allegiance to Trinamool? There does not seem to be any significant change in this Lok Sabha election and in the near future
 india today group-sisero ne 1 se 5 april ke bich pashchim bengal ke 1,706 matadaataaon par janamat surveykshan kiya
 According to him, TMC will get 26 (± 2) seats out of 42 Lok Sabha seats this time
 2009 ke mukaable is baar use 7 siten zyada milane kii sambhaavna he
 The Left Front can get 10 (± 2) seats, meaning it has a loss of 5 seats compared to the 2009 election
 congress kii jheli main 5 (±1) siten aa sakati hai or bijepi 1 (±1) seat se khaataa khol sakati he
 Seats slipping from the left and slipping towards the TMC may prove to be a vote of loyalty to the voters, but they hide a major shift in vote share
 rajya ke gramin or shahari ilaakon main tiemasi kii lokapriyata badi he
 Where the party got 31 in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 2 fisadi vot mili the, is baar yah aankada 35 fisadi pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 But 38 met in the 2011 assembly election
 9 fisadi voton kii tulana main yah kam he
 The Trinamool contested the assembly and Lok Sabha elections with the Congress by electoral agreement
 2009 main congress ne sirf 14 siton par chunaav ladaa tha lekin is baar sabhi 42 siton par akele lard rahi he or iskaa vot pratishat bhi 3
 Can range from 6% to 17%
 trinmul or congress kaa badhata vot pratishat 42 nirvachan kshetron main unke badhate janaadhar kaa pratik to he hi, vam morche kii lokapriyata 23 se ghatakar 20 fisadi ho janaa bhi ek kaaran he
 The popularity of the Left Front has fallen sharply in urban areas, especially among the upper castes and elderly people who have witnessed the long rule of the Left
 1980 or 2006 ke bich hue loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main vam morche ko ausatan 49 fisadi vot milte rahe the
 Its popularity declined from 51 per cent to 43 in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections and was reduced to 40 per cent in the 2011 assembly elections
 uski lokapriyata agar isi teji se ghatati rahi or vam morche kii hissedari 23 pratishat par rah gai to uskaa bhi vahi hashr ho saktaa he jo 1980 ke dashak ke madhya or 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh main uttar pradesh or bihar main congress kaa hua tha
 It is very difficult for any party to regain the mass base lost continuously
 india today-sisero janamat sangrah ke mutabik bijepi ko is loksabhaa chunaav main kaaphi laabh ho saktaa he
 The party's vote share may increase more than three-fold compared to 6 percent in 2009, and 19 percent of the vote may give it one or more seats
 rajya main teen main se ek matadaata ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa pasandida ummidavaar mana, rahul ko pradhanmantri pad ke yogya maanane waalon kaa aankada 19 pratishat tha to mamata banerjee kaa 24 pratishat
 However, BJP has an old relationship with West Bengal

 Better known as Chatterjee, Chatterjee became the sympathizer of the Left and with his support won the Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate
 pashchim bengal main 1951 main pehle aam chunaav se hi bijepi chunaav ladati aa rahi he
 It does not exist anywhere in the 1977 and 1980 election records of West Bengal, as it contested as a member of the Janata Party alliance then
 lekin 1989 tak isane 10 se zyada ummidavaar maidan main nahin utaare
 And in 1951, never won any seats other than 2 seats
 lekin 1989 main isane 19 siton or uske baad 1991 tathaa 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 42 siton par ummidavaar khadey kiye
 Its political exile in West Bengal came to an end when in 1998 it entered into a pact with the Trinamool and seized the Dum Dum seat, considered a strong stronghold of the Left near Kolkata
 1999 main isane damdam seat to barkaraar rakhi hi, krishnanagar kii seat bhi isaki jholii main aa gai
 It did not get any seats in 2004, after which its agreement with Trinamool was also broken
 pashchim bengal kii raajnneeti main arase se ladaai vipaksh banaam vam morcha sarkaar ke bich hoti rahi thi
 Now that the Trinamool has strengthened its hold on the chair by defeating the Left Front, the fight for the opposition can be between the Congress and the BJP
 india today group-sisero ke opinian pole ke mutabik, bijepi kii vot hissedari congress se zyada ho sakati he
 Its popularity is increasing in urban areas, especially among upper caste and highly educated voters
 bijepi kaa chunaav abhiyaan sthaneey samasyaon par kendrit rahata he—jaise avaidh apravasi or berogari
 The Modi wave is also having an impact, especially in the constituencies bordering the international border and the seats where Hindu refugees are living in large numbers
 duusare rajyon kii tarah pashchim bengal ke matadaata bhi vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main matdaan ke alag-alag paimaane rakhte hai
 National parties get more votes in Lok Sabha elections than in assembly elections
 india today group-sisero opinian pole bataata he ki mukhyamantri pad ke liye mamata banerjee duusare netaaon se kaaphi aage hai
 If this situation prevails, the 'mamta Lehar' will continue in the assembly elections

 He was an MBA student at Thapar University in Patiala

 Zorawar Singh and Jaskaran Singh, sons of Gurmeet Singh, the then sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Patiala survived
 ve hive par ek mashhoor dhabas par khaanaa khaane gaye hue the
 This case is recorded as an accident and put aside because the roads in Punjab are not unfamiliar with the gruesome death of rich young people in huge gleaming motor cars
 sachaai se paradaa uthaane main, nyaay ke liye dukhi pita kii nirantar koshish or haryana-punjab hycourt kii nigaraanee or hastkshep main do saal lag gaye
 However, Bazvood Bains believes that there was a lot in it for the never-ending losses
 gaganadip ne durghatana se ek din pehle chandigarh ke najadik mohali main apana ghar choda tha or ek aagyaakaari bachche kii tarah chatravaas pahunchane kii khabar apane mata-pita ko di thi
 "he was responsible," says Bains
 mujhe vishwaas nahin ho rahaa tha ki gagan itani der raat ko baahar nikalegaa
 He was not like this
 ''bains ko pehali baar us samay andeh hua jab unhen apane bete kaa shav dekhne nahin diya gaya
 He says, "he (policemen) said that his heart will be shocked
 '' baad main jaanch karne vaale ees kuldeep singh ne bains par jor diya ke ve pehle se taiyaar ek bayaan par dastakhat kar den, jisamen bachche kii maut ko ek durghatana mana gaya he

" ''bains ke mutabik, ek maheene baad unhen patiala police kii durghatana kii kahani main visangatiyaan najar aane lageen

 The photograph of the accident site showed Gagan's corpse at an impossible angle (location) under the crashed vehicle
 bains poochhate hai, ''jab vah driver ke bagal vaali seat par tha to vah gaadi ke neeche kaise aa saktaa he
 The picture also showed that there was no damage to the standing truck, although the police claimed that the SUV hit it directly at a high speed
 nijee jaanch shuru karne ke baad bains ne ek sisitivi camere main durghatana ke bare main jaskaran or joravar ke bayaan ko record kiya
 He said, "there were discrepancies in what those people said
 '' misaal ke taur par donon ne alag-alag dhabas kaa naam bataaya tha jahaan ve 'car durghatana' se pehle gaye the
 Contrary to the police statement, they found that both the survivors, Joravar and Jaskaran, were discharged from the Government Superspeciality Hospital in Chandigarh without serious treatment
 jaskaran kaa baad main mohali ke nijee aspataal cosmo hospital main ilaaj hua
 Bains got shocked by Gagan's Facebook account
 isse unhen joravar ke apane doston ke saath chat kaa pataa chalaa
 He says that from August 30 to September 17, 2010, the information recorded on this social network shows that "there was a conspiracy to kill my son
" '' unke mutabik, iskaa suraag ek intry se laga jo 'krash' ke baad post kii gai thi
 In it, Joravar seems to confirm that the death was not caused by accident, "this goal was accomplished with the help of all the brothers
" ''ab esadm gurmeet singh kaa aarope he ki bains jaanboojhkar unke bete ke khilaaf cese bana rahe hai
 Gurmeet Singh showed a print out of what was posted on Joravar's Facebook wall, saying, "they are showing the same Facebook pages that help their story of murder
" '' ve bacchon kii 'khushi bhari' tasviren bhi dikhaate hai or daawa karte hai ki ve log aapas main 'achche mitra' the
 Bains says the grief revealed on Facebook was "just an attempt to quell suspicion
" mujhe vishwaas he ki mere bete ko uske doston ne maaraa he
 "bains tried several times to reach the top brass of Punjab Police so that his son's case could be investigated as murder

 His report was submitted on December 27, 2011, in which he said that the Patiala police had prepared an FIR for the 'accident'

 According to him, the statements of the main witnesses, including the standing truck driver, were ignored

 Police officials told India Today that the FIR lodged under IPC 297, 304A, 337R 427 against the driver and the driver of the parked truck is illegal
 ''khadi gaadi ke driver par 'tej raftaar se or laaparvaahee' ke saath gaadi chalaane kaa charge kaise lagaaya ja saktaa he? us par zyada se zyada gaiyrkanoonee taur par park karne kaa aarope lagaaya ja saktaa he
 He also said that "even if it was an accident, Zorawar Singh should be caught because Ford was driving the same car
" ''baharhaal, us samay ke dijipi anil kowshik ne pratap kii report ko nazarandaaj kar diya or unhone vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) ko taaja jaanch kaa aadesh de diya jisamen patiala ke esaspi bhi shaamil the
 He initially supervised the investigation
 haalanki baad main grih sachiv bains ne ise 'avaidh' kahkar bhang kar diya lekin esaity ne apni jaanch jari rakhte hue report pesh kii
 Gurbakhsh Bains said that the report was "completely misleading" with an attempt to declare the deaths of Gagandeep and Gaurav as an accident
 ''grih sachiv bains ne kaha ki unhen yah jaanakar 'aghat' laga ki bhang esaity ne bina kanoonee adhikaar ke na sirf apni jaanch jari rakhi balki unki report hycourt tak pahunch gai, jahaan gurbaksh bains kii swatantra arji par sunwaayee kii ja rahi thi

 The Home Secretary said, "I have asked the DGP to hand over the matter to another officer
 ''gurmeet kaa kahana he ki dijipi sumedh singh samet kai police adhikari hatya ke siddhant se asahmat hai

 After the death of the son, he does not remember that he ever slept in peace
 unhone kaha, ''ishwar gaganadip ko maarna nahin chahta tha
 Someone else has killed my son

 His son Mandeep, 12 years older than Gagan, has been depressed since his brother's death

 In such a situation, the question arises that what is the right way to violate the Motor Vehicle Act 2019 by such a strong leader?
