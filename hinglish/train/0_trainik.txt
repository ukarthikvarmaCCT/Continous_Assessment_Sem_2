 But on Tuesday, while going to the Farewell party, Yeddyurappa tried his best to maintain the bully
 padhein: istife ke baad aapa kho baithe the yediurppounhone sarkaar ke aalaa adhikariyon ko kaha ki 6 maheene ke andar wo phir mukhyamantri banenge
 He is confident that in these 6 months he will overcome the crisis and this is the reason that he wants to hand over the chair of Chief Minister to Sadanand Gowda
 ye bayaan na sirf yediurppa kii manshaa jaahir karti he balki isi main chupa he wo raaj bhi ki kyon karnataka ke nae mukhyamantri kaa faisla jald nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Read: Yeddyurappa's challenge to the Lokayukta report in the High Court will be fulfilled only when the new Chief Minister of Karnataka will get hold of him
 or is lihaaj se yediurppa ke khasmkhas sadanand gauda karnataka kii siem kii kursi ke sabase majboot daavedaar ho jate hai
 But Panchayati Raj Minister Jagdish Shettar also has little hold over mlas and hence he is also a strong contender for the post of CM
 lekin do majboot daavedaaron main se ek kaa faisla kaise ho
 The decision is difficult and so Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley have arrived in Bangalore again
 abhi tak jo tasviir ubhar kar saamne aa rahi he usamen jagadish shettar or sadanand gauda donon hi mukhyamantri pad ke baraabar ke daavedaar hai or donon main se kisi ek kaa chayan karnataka ke kalah ko khatm karne ke bajaae badha saktaa he
 So maybe a formula like a Chief Minister and a Deputy Chief Minister comes to the fore by the end
 gauratlab he ki karnataka ke lokayukta ne yediurppa par avaidh khanan main lipt rahane kaa aarope lagaaya he, jiske baad party ke dabaav main unhen pad se istipha dena padaa

 It has been two weeks since the unprecedented communication blockade of Jammu and Kashmir
 My heart is heavy as the sky is dark over India's democracy right now
 My heart has always ached for the terrible human rights violations in the Valley - right from the times of the Congress government in the 90’s
 The disappearances and killing of innocent youth is not new
 Nor is the opening of fire on demonstrations
 But this government has crossed every line with it's draconian measures
 i want to ask every Indian - every Bengali, Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamilian et al - how would you feel if your State was split overnight and converted into a Union Territory? Leave Article 370 aside for a moment and answer that honestly
 For me the shock and anger at this unconstitutional act is laced with sorrow at how our own people must be feeling in this part of our country
 Feelings we can only imagine - as there is still a blackout! On a personal level i have never known anyone before in the State
 But now i have a child there
 Zaira Wasim - the heart and soul of The Sky is Pink
 i have known her and her family over one year - spent marvelous times with them in both Srinagar and Jammu
 i was with them in Jammu just a day before this happened
 Zaira was very worried that something terrible was afoot because of the sudden influx of massive troops
 i reassured her not dreaming something so draconian and unprecedented could be carried out
 And since then I'm besides myself with worry at not being able to reach her
 To give her strength at this difficult time
 To wish them Eid Mubarak
 I’m sure they couldn’t celebrate it
 We parted with the promise to stay in touch every day
 Echoing a promise she and her brother make to each other in the film in a brilliantly acted and moving scene
 But i can't reach my baby right now

 The High Court has reprimanded Deputy CM and Education Minister Manish Sisodia over the case of guest teachers in Delhi
 court aae sisodiya ko ummid thi ki adaalat dilli sarkaar ko shaayad kuch raahat degi lekin raahat to nahin mili balki hoicourt ne shiksha mantri ko hi aade haathon le liya
 The High Court hit back at Education Minister Manish Sisodia, asking why the government does not want to follow the rules of appointments? The court wanted to know the selfishness of the government behind why it wants to make guest teachers permanent
 court ne kaha ki agar teachers laayak hai to pariksha paas karke bhi chunakar aa sakate hai
 The Delhi High Court had a question as to why the Delhi government wanted to make permanent those teachers who do not have talent to pass the exam
 haalanki manish sisodiya ne shiksha mantri ke taur par apana paksh rakhte hue court ko kaha ki agar 17 hazaar guest teachers ko hataaya gaya to ye dilli ke sarkari skulon ke 60 lakhbacchon ke bhavishya ke saath khilavaarhogi
 The High Court said that your lawyer had already said that guest teachers should be replaced with permanent teachers, according to the rule, guest teachers cannot be permanent
 bina test paas kiye unhen sthai teachers nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 On Thursday, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejashwi Yadav has attacked the Modi government in a rude manner, so the JDU also retaliated
 tejasvi yadav ne aam bajet ko drushti viheen or dishaheen qaraar diya he, to jadyu ne javaabi tanj ksaa
 On this attack of Tejashwi Yadav, JDU took a dig at him and asked why the decisions of the central government for the poor and backward are not digesting them
 Taking a dig at Tejashwi Yadav, JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh said that it is very surprising that Hakmarji is not digesting the decisions taken for the backward and uplift of Dalits in the general budget
 jadyu pravaktaa ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki vittamantri arun jetali ne 10 karod garib pariwaron ke ilaaj ke liye paanch lakh rupee tak kaa ilaaj muft karaane kii yojana banaai he or kisaanon ko laagat mulya par dedh guna nunatam samarthan mulya dene kaa faisla kiya he, magar ye faisle tejasvi yadav ko pach nahin rahe hai
 JDU said that Operation Greens have been started for fruit growing farmers in the general budget, which will directly benefit the banana and litchi growers of Bihar
 iske alaava bajet main kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye 11 lakh karod rupee kaa fund banane kaa elaan kiya gaya he, lekin ye sabhi kalyankari faisle tejasvi yadav ko dikhaai nahin de rahe hai
 JDU asked Tejashwi that he is not digging the decisions taken for the welfare of the farmers of Bihar in the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cabinet? Sanjay Singh said that during Lalu Rabri's 15 years of rule, farmers have been shown only lollipops and now when the farmers are getting their rights during the tenure of NDA, the snake is rolling on the chest of RJD leaders
 tejasvi yadav ko ghotaalaa ram kehete hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki jab lalu rabari ke shasankaal ke dauraan kisaanon kaa haq maaraa ja rahaa tha, to us vakt tejasvi yadav kahaan khamosh baithe the? sanjay singh ne kaha ki jab lalu parivaar garibon kaa khun chus rahaa tha, to us vakt tejasvi kii naitikta kahaan mar gai thi?jadyu ne yah bhi kaha ki chaahe saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav hon yaa phir saal 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav, tejasvi urf ghotaalaa ram ke parivaar ke liye kai saalon tak no vaikency he
 JDU said that the public has now known the truth of the Lalu family and will not be deceived again

 jaanch agency se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki jis din donon chacheri bahanon kii hatya hui us din is parivaar se judi ek or ladki gaanv main thi or ghatana ke baad dilli chali gai thi
 Sources are telling that the CBI has done a round of talk in Delhi itself

 The CBI believes that if the story of the dupatta is resolved, it will not take long to intercept the incident
 sutron kii maane to katra saadatganj main kathith balaatkaar ke baad hatya kar ped se latakaai gai chacheri bahanon ke ek rishtedaar dilli main rahete hai
 His 12-year-old daughter was in Katra Saadatganj on 27 May
 ghatana ke baad use dilli bhej diya gaya tha
 Dupattas were used to hang both girls on the tree after the murder
 inamen jis dupattey par badi ladki lataki thi vah uskaa nahin tha

 Actor Viju Khote became immortal by playing the role of Kalia in Sholay, Bollywood's most popular and historical film made by Ramesh Sippy
 saal 1975 main ai is film ke liye aaj bhi viju khote ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 Even though Viju is not among us today, but whenever Kalia or Sholay's name comes up, people will always have their thoughts in mind
 actor viju khote kaa janm 17 disambar 1941 ko mumbai main hua tha
 He was an actor of Hindi and Marathi films
 unhone film maalik se apana filmi debyue kiya tha
 In his career, Viju acted in several films
 sholay, nagina, andaaj apana apana, khilaadi 420, hallaa bol, golmaal 3 or 2018 main ai marathi film ventilator jaisi filmon main viju khote ko dekha gaya or unke kaam ko saraahaa gaya
 Viju Khote, who has been close to Amjad Khan, has always had the image of Kalia in his film Sholay
 bahut kam hi logon ko pataa he ki viju khote, gabbar kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaale actor amjad khan ko theatre ke dinon se jaanate the
 They were both from the same theater group and had worked together in many theater plays
 film sholay main viju ke kirdaar kaaliya kaa dialog 'sardaar maine aapkaa namak khaaya he' kaaphi femes hua tha
 In this film, Viju got only 7 minutes of screen space and he has been remembered for that for decades
 ek event ke dauraan sholay ke diarector ramesh sippi ne bataaya tha ki kaise unhone maatr 20 lakh rupee main puri star cast ko selary di thi
 In fact, Ramesh Sippy had taken Rs 3 crore from his father, GP Sippy, to make Sholay, due to which the entire Starcast salary was settled for Rs 20 lakh
 sholay bani bhi sirf isliye thi kyonki usase pehle sippi kii film sita or gita hit ho gai thi
 Sita and Geeta were made for a mere Rs 40 lakh and were a hit
 kaaliya ke role ke liye mili the 2500 rupekisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki sholay ko bollywood main kalt kaa darja milga
 In 20 lakhs, Ramesh Sippy paid a fee to the entire star cast of the film, but you know how much money Viju Khote got from it? It is believed that Viju was paid only Rs 2500 for his role in Sholay
 vahiin film main ahamed kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaale actor sachin pilganvkar ko fees ke taur par ek refricrator diya gaya tha
 Viju's family is deeply rooted in cinema
 Like Nataviju Khote, his family has always been associated with acting, Bollywood and TV industry
 unke pita nandu khote nami stage actor the or unhone bahut si silent filmon main kaa kiya tha
 Her aunt Durga Khote was one of the famous and talented actresses of Bollywood
 unki badi bahan shubha khote ko ham sabhi sharaarat, seenaa, choti bahan sang anya filmon ke saath-saath tivi serialon or marathi filmon main bhi dekh chuke hai
 His niece Bhavna Balsavar was seen in the famous television show Bhai Dekh
 viju ne apane filmi kariyar main hindi or marathi milakar lagbhag 300 filmon main kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, he also worked in about 30 TV serials
 viju ko kamedi karnaa pasand tha or isliye unhone villen ke role chhodkar comic rolls karne shuru kiye the
 a video of a Trinamool Congress leader in West Bengal has surfaced in which he is seen distributing checks to the people
 voton ke badale check baantne vaala yah netaa trinmul congress kaa panchayat pradhan he
 In the video, he is heard threatening that if people did not vote for the Trinamool Congress, the consequences would be bad
 check baantne ke kram main usne yah bhi kaha ki 'didi ne tohfe main check diya he or logon ke pahchaan patr unke kabje main he
 The name of this Trinamool Congress leader is Modassur Hussain, who is the panchayat head of South 24 Parganas district
 check kii raashi 2 hajaar rupye se lekar 5 hajaar rupye tak he
 In the video, the leader also said that the check had been given by Didi (mamata Banerjee), so the vote has to be given to the Trinamool Congress in the general election
 pehle charan ke 100 pariwaron ko check dene kii baat kahi gai jise baad main badhaakar 600 parivaar karne kaa usne aashwaasan diya
 Modassur Hussain is speaking in the meeting behind closed doors, 'these four words have to be kept in mind - the checks have been given by Didi, so we have to vote for the next election because we are giving you the check
 main saaf kah rahaa hum ki vot hamen nahin diya to tum logon ke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 
 
 
 
 Do not forget that we have your real photo identity card
 abhi ham tumhen asli pahchaan patr kii photo copy de rahe hai
 'trinamool leader Modassur Hussain further said that' Always remember that you don't get Rs 2 lakh after death
 isliye hamen vot dena
 Our candidate Mimi is a cyclone, so you have to vote on the Joraphool (trinamool) election symbol
 main saaf kah rahaa hum ki maujuuda esadio or anya adhikariyon ke baavjood hamen hi vot dena he
 Didi promised to give the check, according to which it is being distributed
 agali baar 2 hajaar, 4 hajaar or 2500 ke check dekhne ko milenge
 You can get even more money ahead
 ho saktaa he kisaanon ko zyada mili
 Next thing, when Mimi Chakraborty comes to the fair ground, everyone has to be present there
 'trinmul netaa modassur hossain apane bayaan par ab bhi kaayam he
 He later told journalists that 'we are giving checks so we asked people to vote
 unhen hamen vot dena hoga
 
 
 What is wrong with it ' trinmul congress ne mimi chakravarti ko jadavapur nirvachan kshetra se tikat diya he or modassur hasan kuch dinon se unka prachaar abhiyaan sambhaal rahaa he

 Puran Singh, an elder of Rajgarh district of Madhya Pradesh who went to Uttarakhand on a visit to Chardham, is one of the few lucky people who have returned home alive
 lekin puuran singh kii ankhen nam hai
 He is unable to forget that dreadful scene when his childhood friend Dariyav Singh parted from him forever
 puuran singh ne phir bhi apane dost kaa saath or haath nahin choda
 He spent seven days on the mountains with the corpse of Dariyav Singh
 puuran singh jaise kai or log bhi hai, jinhone uttarakhand kii is aapadaa main apano ko kho diya he
 Puran and Dariyav (65 years) of Sarangpur in Rajgarh were friends since childhood and both had planned to visit Kedarnath together

 It rained with strong winds

 Puran says that he somehow took refuge on the mountain

 He was lying on the mountain with the body of his friend Dariyav Singh in an uneven situation

 Pooran Singh regrets that he had gone to Kedarnath to earn merit, but returned home with the body of a friend

 achaanak cash kii badi maang or desh ke kai hisson main atm main cash uplabdh na hone se rigerv bank ko baikfoot par aana padaa
 The government and the Reserve Bank have stepped up efforts to improve the situation, but nothing can be said about when the situation will return to normal
 in sabake bich nakadi sankat kii do aisi vajahen hai jin par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin ja rahaa
 Various reasons are being cited for cash crunch
 sarkaar or rigerv bank ne jin vajahon ko ab tak bataaya he unamem bade noton kaa band hona, karnataka ke chunaav ke pehle noton kii maang bad janaa, desh ke kai hisson main tyohaar, fasal sijan aadi kii vajah se nakadi kii baari nikasi aadi shaamil hai
 But the thing to note is that festivals come every year and elections are also in the same state
 iske pehle tripura, nagaland, meghalaya, gujarat, himachal main chunaav ho chuke hai
 But such situations have never been seen before
 do aisi vajahen hai jin par gaur karnaa hoga
 1
 bank jamaa main nahin hui paryaapt badhatin sabake bich agar rigerv bank kii haal kii ek report par najar daalen to desh ke bainkon main 30 march, 2018 tak kul jamaa 114
 75 lakh crores, whereas it was 107 a year ago
 58 lakh karod rupee tha
 In this way it has increased, but only 6 in a financial year
 7 fisadi
 This is the lowest increase in deposits of banks in the last 54 years
 jaankaar iske lienotbandi ke dauranbhari jamaa kii vajah se base zyada hone or bainkon ke byaaj dar ghatane ko vajah bataa rahe hai
 Due to the low interest rate of banks, people are investing more money in equity mutual funds than fds
 2
 Another major reason for the cash crunch on cash transfers is that about a month ago, the Reserve Bank banned banks from transferring cash from one circle to another circle
 haalankiriserv bankpahale bhi aisa karata rahaa he, lekin iskaa nateeja yah hua ki kisi bank ke kuch ilaakon ke branch main jarurat se zyada nakadi padi rahi to kuch main cash kii baari tangi ho gai
 Punjab Energy Minister Rana Gurjit Singh, who got the tender of sand mine in the name of his cook, is once again in the headlines
 unke bete rana indra pratap singh par aarope he ki unhone bina ijaajat videshon main global dipogitary riseat (jeediar) ke madhyam se kareeb 100 karod rupee jutaaye or phir use madiraa island, portugal ke ek bank main jamaa kiya
 After that money was transferred to the account of his company Rana Sugars Limited in India
 pravartan nideshalayane rana indra pratap singh ko notice bhejkar 17 janvari ko vyaktigat rup se hajir hone ke liye kaha he
 The Enforcement Directorate suspects that Rana Indra Pratap Singh, Rana Gurjit Singh's son, collected money illegally by selling shares of his company abroad
 paisa rana shugars limited naam kii company ke naam par ikattha kiya gaya, jo 1992 main sthapit kii gai thi
 It is headquartered in Chandigarh
 indra pratap is company ke prabandh nideshak hai
 This company was founded by Punjab Energy Minister Rana Gurjit Singh
 sutron ke mutabikarana inder pratap sinhane femaa kaa ulanghan karke na keval avaidh tareeke se paisa jutaya balki videshi niveshkon dwaara videshi bainkon se uthaae gaye karj kii guarantee bhi di
 Investigation conducted so far has revealed that Rana Sugar Ltd did not give any information about this amount to the Reserve Bank of India, whereas under FEMA rules, it is necessary to inform the Reserve Bank about the funds raised abroad
 yahi nahin urja mantri or unke bete kii company ne 100 karod rupee kahaan kharch kiye iskaa vyora bhi nahin he
 According to sources, this mess was brought by SEBI to the ed's attention
 kyonki rana kii company ne sebi ko bhi 100 karod rupee jutaney kii soochna nahin di thi
 However, Rana Sugars Limited has rejected the allegations of the Enforcement Directorate citing instructions issued on 19 January 2000 by the Department of Economic Affairs
 unhone kaha he ki niyamon ke tahat hi videshon se paisa jutaya he
 But Directorate of Promotion is not satisfied with the response of Rana Sugars Limited
 2 janvari ko jari kiye gaye notice ke aadhaar par rana shugars limited ke prabandh nideshak rana indra pratap singh ko vyaktigat rup se 17 janvari ko pravartan nideshaalay main hajir hone ke liye kaha gaya he

 Intensive care rooms should be built

 The head of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, who dissociated from the NDA coalition in the name of seat-sharing, joined the UPA on Thursday
 is maukey par unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolte hue bihar kii janata se vaadakhilaphi kaa aarope lagaaya
 Former Union Minister Kushwaha had said that Modi in Bihar had said in almost every meeting at the time of elections that people of Bihar would not have to go out for education, medicine and earning
 lekin noujvaan aaj bhi badi sankhya main kamai ke liye baahar ja rahe hai, na skulon kii vyavastha hui na hi ilaaj kii koi vyavastha hui
 Praising Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Kushwaha said that it is not a matter of today that there is no difference in his words and actions
 rahul ne jo vaayade kiye use puraa kiya
 When the land acquisition bill was being brought, the RLSP also opposed it and the Congress took it as a mission
 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke congress mukhyalay main mahagathbandhan ke vistaar or bal mila jab congress ke aalaa netaaon samet purv kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha argedy netaa tejasvi yadav, bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi kii maujuudagi main upie kaa hissaa ban gaye
 On this occasion, Kushwaha said that he was being insulted in the NDA
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne unhen neech kahkar apamaanit kiya
 He said that RJD chief Lalu Yadav and Congress President Rahul Gandhi showed leniency after he left the NDA
 upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki nitish kumaar hamen (RLSP) barbaad karnaa chaahate hai or isamen centre kii shaktiyaan unka saath de rahi hai
 That is why we felt that the voice of the people of Bihar should be heard
 isliye main upie main shaamil ho rahaa hum
 Kushwaha alleged that Nitish Kumar vowed to break up his party and ruin Bihar
 upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki bihar main shiksha acchhee ho, dalit, garib, pichde or garib savarna ke bacchon ke liye sarkari skool hai
 If their 25 point demand related to education was met, there was no problem of seat sharing
 lekin bihar sarkaar ke mukhiya ne unhen neech kahkar apamaanit kiya
 His economic reforms are known as 'abenomics'

 The court order came when Aditya Verma of the opposition Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB) told the court that Bihar was formed after the formation of Jharkhand on 15 November 2000 and after the bifurcation of the state, with the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy and any other There is no opportunity to play in domestic tournament

 ' Chit fund scams are not new in this country
 yah baat bhi nai nahin he ki kisi bhi duusare udyog-dhandhe ke mukaable chitfund companiyon ke maalik raajnneetik dalon ke zyaada qareeb dekhe gaye hai
 Not only this, these chit fund companies have been trying their hand at media as well
 pichley do-teen dashakon main kai chitfund companiyaan shuru or band huin or unke saath bahut se garibon or madhyamvargeey logon kii mehnat kii kamai bhi lut gai
 It is not news that the owners of companies have made more difference than this
 in tamaam companiyon ne akhbaar or tivi channel shuru kiye, netaaon se aisi qareebi rakhi ki har nijee yaa saamaajik samaaroh main unki upasthiti surkhiyaan banaati rahi
 Given this past, there is no reason to believe that the Saradha scam has not dealt with the leaders
 sharada chitfund ke ghapale ke aaropee bhi pakade jane chahie or garibon ko unka paisa waapas milanaa chahie
 But is the CBI action a result of any government concern to fight corruption or scams, or is it an attempt to bend the arms of an opposition leader
 
 
 ? agar vaaki BJP sarkaar ko sharada ghotaale kii fikr hoti, to vah kam se kam mukul roy ko apni party main shaamil nahin karti, jo is ghotaale ke mukhya aropiyon main ek hai
 He was inducted into the party when the FIR was already done and in the presence of senior leaders like Ravi Shankar Prasad and Kailash Vijayvargiya
 yahi nahin, amit shah se unki mulaakaat bhi karai gai
 Shouldn't the party have asked how Mukul Roy is trying to sneak into his tidy house despite being surrounded by allegations of involvement in the Saradha scam
 
 
 ?kehane kaa matlab yah nahin ki agar mukul roy ko BJP bachaa rahi he, to duusare bhrasht netaaon par karrwai nahin honi chahie
 But when you are becoming extra sensitive in any one case by ignoring many cases of corruption and defending the accused in many cases, weaken the fight against corruption, giving it a political color
 kolkata main dharne par baithi mamata banerjee yah baat thik se samajhati hai, isliye jis kanoonee pachade se unhen or unke netaaon ko darana chahie tha, uske viruddh vah datakar khadi ho gai hai
 They know that this fight is not against corruption, it is against their politics
 agar unke apane logon yaa karibiyon ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi he, to is raajnneetik ladaai kii aad main vah ise chhipaane main kaamyaab ho jaaengi
 It is not uncommon that Mamata did not get any longer and difficult to get the support of non-bjp political parties across the country
 to ham paa rahe hai ki jise bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ek vaastavik ladaai kii tarah lade jane kii zarurat thi, use centre sarkaar kii sakriyata ne ek raajnneetik ladaai main badal daalaa he
 Those who are arguing that all the unscrupulous people have gathered against an honest government have either kept their eyes off the facts or deliberately chosen their side
 kyonki sharada ghotaale par karrwai karne nikali sarkaar ke vittamantri isi hafte ek or ghapale ke aropiyon ke paksh main khulkar khadey hote nazar aae hai
 You may recall that recently the news came that the CBI had filed a case against Chanda Kochhar, CEO of ICICI Bank and Venugopal Dhoot, owner of Videocon
 un par aapasi mileebhagat se bank ko karodon kaa chuunaa lagane kaa ilzaam he
 This charge has been made for many years and the bank has denied it for many years
 lekin tathy saamne aate rahe, to bank ne andruni jaanch bithai
 Based on this investigation, the bank acted on Chanda Kochhar, first resigning from him and later withholding his pension
 unase vasuuli kii bhi baat ho rahi he
 But in this case, the officer who lodged an FIR on behalf of the CBI was transferred within 24 hours
 kyonki saat samandar paar apana ilaaj kara rahe desh ke vittamantri or BJP ke sabase taqatvar netaaon main se ek arun jetali ne saarvajanik taur par blog likhakar CBI jaanch ko bemaani qaraar diya or chanda kochar or baaki logon kaa bachaav kiya
 He directly said that this investigation is not going to reach anywhere, because the aim is to trap some people
 jo log bhrashtachar ke maamle main apane hi santhaan dwaara sazaayaftaa ek CEO kaa aisa khulkar bachaav kar sakate hai, ve kisi anya maamle main samvedansheel hote hai, to darasal isse bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai hi nahin, is ladaai ke liye banaai gai sansthaaen tak avishwasaneey hone lagati hai
 It is not uncharacteristic that the CBI has been surrounded by most controversies over the years
 vahaan sheersh str kaa takaraav bilkul adaalaton tak ja pahunchaa he
 Needless to say that this is the result of excessive use of political use of CBI
 ab duusare sawaal par aaen
 Why did BJP suddenly think of this political action
 
 
 ? yah maananaa atirikt bholepan kaa pradarshan karnaa hoga ki CBI kii ek team kolkata ke police kamishnar se bina raajnneetik manzuri ke poochtacha karne pahunch gai
 So did the BJP not know that this step would give Mamata Banerjee another drama opportunity for her dramatic politics
 
 
 ? mamata apni raajnneetik ladaaiyaan bilkul daant bheenchakar ladati hai or is maamle main bhi unhone yah kaam kiya
 He made so much noise that the leaders of the whole country gathered
 ab yah 2019 ke pehle kaa ek or shakti pradarshan ho gaya he
 Undoubtedly the BJP must have had its own strategy
 bengal main uskaa apana bada daanv nahin he - uske paas do siten hai, isliye uske paas ganvaane ko kuch nahin he
 But by opening the front of Sharada scam against Mamta, it has also confused the Bengal Congress and has also encouraged the CPM to attack
 zaahir he, mamata kisi bhi tarah kamazor hon, usase gathbandhan kamazor hoga
 But this politics can also turn and attack
 peedit kaa abhinay karnaa mamata se behatar koi nahin jaanata
 They can get far more sympathy from Bengal
 is lihaaj se dekhen, to haal ke dinon main centre yaa BJP sarkaron ke kai qadam hadabadaae hue qadam dikhaai pad rahe hai
 The mistakes the UPA government was doing between 2013-14, the Modi government is also making similar mistakes
 dilli main bina rajya sarkaar kii manzuri ke kanhaiya kumaar or kalid umr ke kilaaf chargeshit daayar karnaa aisa hi qadam tha
 On this step, the police had to hear the rebuke of the court
 isi tarah pune main supreme court ke sangrakshan ke baavjood profesar anand teltumbade kii giraftaari kii vajah se maharashtra police ko hoicourt ne fatkaaraa
 These panicked steps suggest that there is panic within the party and the government
 pashchim bengal main CBI kii tazaa karrwai bhi isi ghabaraai hui mudra kaa nateeja he
 a game of money with dazzles and runs

 For ten years this 'shine' was shown by Sony Pictures Network India but now the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is waiting for a new agreement
 soni ke paas board ko peshkash dene kaa pehla adhikaar tha, lekin bisisiai ne khuli nivida bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 In the year 2008, World Sports Group acquired IPL rights worth about 6500 crores
 main hasil kiye the, jisane adhikarik prasaaran ke liye soni se haath milaayaa
 Now the board is hopeful that for ten years from the new agreement, it can get three times the amount of Rs 18,000 crore from it
 tippaniyan The world is looking at this tender in line with the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, but the board says it has already shed the winds of reforms, on Sunday, in Delhi, Board President Anurag Thakur said, "where are our works challenging the court?" Yes, i do not think this is happening
 hamane kai sudhaar lodha cameti kii siforeeshon se pehle shuru kar die the
 The board expects to get triple the amount from the agreement, but the same money can also become a legal trap
 soni ko pehle inkaar kaa adhikaar tha, lekin nivida mangakar board ne ise darkinar kar diya
 According to sources, the digital rights are also with the WSG, in which the BCCI may get caught in the new legal tussle despite accepting the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 bisisiai is baar bhartiya upmahadweep ke liye 10 saalon ke adhikaar bech rahaa he, lekin digital or baaki deshon ke liye adhikaar kii avadhi 5 saal hogi
 The board is seen playing on the front foot in front of the Lodha Committee before the annual general meeting, but on broadcast this maneuver could push it back onto the backfoot in the legal arena
 varsh 2008 main world sports group ne ipel ke adhikaar takreeban 6500 karod ru
 , Which joined Sony for official broadcasting
 ab board ko ummid he nae qaraar se das saalon ke liye wo isse tiguni takreeban 18,000 karod rupee kii rakam hasil kar sakati he
 The comments duniya is nivida ko lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ke anuroop dekh rahi he, lekin board kaa kahana he usne sudhaaron kii bayaar pehle se hi baha rakhi he, ravivaar ko dilli main board adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne kaha, " hamaare kaam kahaan court ko chunauti de rahe hai, mujhe nahin lagata aisa ho rahaa he
 We started many reforms before the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 board ko qaraar se tiguni rakam milane kii ummid he, lekin yahi paisa kanoonee fans bhi ban saktaa he
 Sony had the right of first refusal, but the board bypassed the tender, bypassing it
 sutron ke mutabik digital adhikaar bhi dabloosgy ke paas hai aise main bisisiai, lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ko maanane ke baavjood nae kanoonee pachade main funs saktaa he
 The BCCI is selling 10 years of rights for the Indian subcontinent this time, but for digital and other countries, the duration of the rights will be 5 years
 board salanaa aam baithak se pehle lodha cameti ke saamne front foot par kheltaa dikh rahaa he, lekin prasaaran par ye pintara kanoonee maidan main use waapas baikfoot par dhakel saktaa he

 The 25-year-old budding actor said, at a time when actors used to do many films at the same time, he (aamir) decided to work differently and focused on one thing at a time

 'war and Peace' is a novel by the famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy
 sunwaayee ke dauraan yah upanyaas bahes kaa vishay ban gaya
 The Pune police investigating the case claimed that it was one of the most inflammatory evidence seized during a raid on Gonzalvis' house in Mumbai a year ago
 ucch nyaayalay ne varnon gonjalvis (vernon Gonsalves) ke ghar se jabt jin pustakon or sidi kaa zikr kiya he, unamem kabir kala manch dwaara jari sidi ‘rajya daman virdohi', marxist archivs, jai bhima kamred or liyo tolsty kii saahitiyik kriti ‘waar and pis', ‘anderstanding maoist', ‘aaaraseepi rivyuu' or neshnal study cirkil dwaara jari paripatr kii pratiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Justice Kotwal said, "the name of 'CD' anti-state repression 'itself says that it has something against the state, while' War and Peace 'is about war in another country
" aapke (gonjalvis) paas ghar par ye kitaaben or sidi kyon hai? aapako adaalat ko yah spasht karnaa hoga

 gonjalvis ke vakil mihir desai ne ucch nyaayalay main kaha ki pune police ne unke khilaaf puure maamle ko kuch i-mail or patron ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya jo anya logon ke computaron se mili the
 Desai argued, "not a single letter or email was written or addressed by Gonzalvis 
" isliye unke khilaaf kisi thos saboot ke abhaav main gonjalvis ko jamaanat se inkaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Desai countered the prosecution's argument that "such books and cds" do not make Gonzalvis a terrorist or a member of a banned Maoist group
 aisi saamagree rakhane se hi kisi ko aatankwaadi qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa, bachaav paksh kii is daleel se sahmati jataate hue nyaayamurti kotwaal ne kaha ki haalanki gonjalvis ko spasht karnaa hoga ki unhone ghar par is tarah kii saamagree kyon rakhi thi
 The judge said that the Pune police would also have to convince the court that the contents of such cds and books were like concrete evidence against Gonzalvis

 haal hi main hue ek survey main pataa chalaa tha ki naukari kii talash karne vaale 57 fisadi log apane rigeume main galat jaankariyaan dete hai
 By doing this, the candidates' impression gets spoiled even before the interview
 isse bachane ke liye rigeume banaate samay saamaanya galatiyon se lekar usamen likhi jane vaali baton par behad dhyaan dene kii jarurat hoti he
 Candidates make the most mistakes in stating their objective and quality
 ham yahaan aapako kuch aisi baton ke bare main bataaenge jo lagbhag har rigeume main dekhne ko milti hai or isse recruiter sabase zyada chidhate hai yaa bor hote hai
 1
 main kisi bhi sankat ko khatm kar saktaa / sakati hunjyaadaatar recruiter is baat ko rigeume main dekhnaa pasand nahin karte hai
 Unless you have valid points to prove your point, do not forget to write the same
 rigumen main kisi bhi sankat ko khatm karne kaa daawa karke aap apane liye pareshaani khadi kar lete hai
 2
 main behtareen communicator or acha likhane vaala / vaali huunaapaki is skill kaa andaja aapke rigeume kii madad se aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Communication skills and writing skills should be mentioned in the resume, but good things or 'getting yourself mad' will not be good for your career
 3
 i am expert in working in the team
 You might not know that the resumes that come to the recruiter, most of them are written in the same things
 agar aapke paas sach main yah skill he to acchhee baat he
 During the interview, the panel will know whether you are really fit to work with the team or not
 aisi jaankariyon se aap recruiter ko bor hi karenge
 4
 main kaaphi parishramee humrijume main yah likhane ki katai jarurat nahin he ki aap bahut mehnatee hai
 If you are capable, then your blog, write-up, technical skills and your studies will give testimony about this
 agar sach main naukari paanaa chaahate hai to apane bare main yah likhane se bachein
 5
 main dawaab main acha kaam karata / karti hunaisa kehane se recruiter aapse yah nahin kehane lagenge ki ham to bas aapke jaise ladke / ladakiyon ko khoj rahe the
 On the contrary, they will start scratching their heads after seeing your resume
 aise main hameshaa soch-samajhakar likhnaa chahie
 No person who loves his work can give good output under pressure
 agar vah kaamchor he tabhi dawaab main kaam karegaa
 Do not spoil your impression

 Manish Sabharwal, chairman of teamlease, says the government's direct emphasis is on providing formal infrastructure to infrastructure and economy, not so much on human resources
 ve kehete hai, ''hamaari samasya akele rojgaar nahin, acchhee naukariyon ko lekar he
 You have to increase productivity
 " sabharwal ne vitt mantri se rojgaar kshetra main niamak pratibandhon ko kam karne kii guzarish kii he jise ve ''regulatory cholestrol" kaa naam dete hai
 They believe that the job of the government is not to provide employment, but to create a favorable environment for employment

 The government has not taken any concrete steps towards increasing consumption

 Experts say that this year's budget estimates should have been compared with last year's revised estimates, which showed a 7 percent increase in expenditure
 kai ko aisa lagata he ki vitt mantri ko duube hue karjon se sangharsh kar rahe sarkari bainkon ke puunjikaran par bhi bolnaa chahie tha
 The government did not discuss the impact of demonetisation
 kai logon ko aisa lagata he ki aisa isliye kiya gaya kyonki nakad ke rup main rakhe gaye kaale dhan kaa aakaar anumaan se kahin kam niklaa
 In view of the elections in several states this year, it is possible that the finance minister has deliberately avoided any "shocking remedies"

 road sho khatm hone se kuch der pehle lahurabir chauraahey par is kaarykram ko kuch der ke liye rokna padaa
 Later the roadshow proceeded without Sonia

 At the circuit house, Sonia started the march by garlanding the statue of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and traveled through the streets and narrow streets of this holy city
 is dauraan sonia ne SUV par khadey hokar hajaaron logon kaa abhivadan sweekaar kiya
 Around 10,000 bike-riding Congress workers were leading the Congress President's convoy of cars
 is road sho ke jariye yah sanket diya gaya ki party upi ko kitni ahmiyat detii he
 While waiting for Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday morning, the state Congress chief Raj Babbar candidly admitted, 'we need a miracle in UP
 ' haalanki unhone joda, 'aisa purv main bhi ho chukaa he
 Even 2014 was a miracle for our opposition

 ' upi ke kareeb 21 fisadi voter dalit hai
