 logon ko tay karnaa he ki iti cell ke tarkon ke hisaab se sochna he yaa apane hisaab se sochna he
 It is now being said that the students of Jamia have been seduced, the work of the students has to be read, not performed
 kya aap vaaki yah maanate hai ki chaatr sirf bahekaave or uksaave par pradarshan kar rahe hai? padhai ko lekar jab dilli uniwarsity ke edock shikshak pradarshan karte hai tab to koi nahin bolta
 Crores of youth across the country also agitate for government job exams and university exams, eat sticks
 koi dhyaan nahin detaa he
 Recently, 11 lakh students took an exam in Gujarat
 pariksha me dhaandhlee kii khabaron ko lekar gandhinagar main bada pradarshan kiya jinhen lathi se daudaya gaya
 Today the exam was canceled
 kya saath whatsap uniwarsity or iti cell ne unka saath diya? upi ke hi 69000 shikshak bhartee ko lekar kai dinon se sangharsh ho rahaa he, kisi ne parvaah kii he? to phir akele jamiya or jeenyu ke chaatro ko yah lacture kyon? whatsap uniwarsity ne apni takat or prasar ke dam par yahi kiya he
 We accept everything he says
 jamiya millia main ravivaar kii police kii barbarta ke pehle shuukravaar ko bhi lathi charge hua
 Tear gas shells were released after entering the campus
 ravivaar ko agar bahari log bhadkaa rahe the to phir campus ke bheetar aansu gas ke gole daagate hue police ko yah khyaal nahin aayaa ki chaatro ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 She walks in and circles the library
 kal raat khud disipi ne mana tha ki chaatro ke saath koi ishyu nahin he
 You watch these videos dhyaan rakhie ki ye video bhi puri kahani nahin kehete hai
 If the students of Jamia had not sought help from everyone on Sunday, no one would have known that such vandalism was being perpetrated on them
 khud vaais chancelar barbarta shabd kaa istamaal karti hai
 Many videos surfaced when police DCP Monica Bhardwaj and soldiers were attacked within Tis Hazari Court
 zaahir he dilli police ne hi media ko diya hoga, sutron ke hawaale se
 So far, such videos have not come out from the police, which shows that Jamia's students are committing violence on Sunday
 kya kisi ko bhi shame nahin ai ki uniwarsity ke chaatro ko aparaadhiyon kii tarah haath uthaakar baahar nikaala gaya? agar yahi tasviir kisi bhaajapa shasit rajya kii hoti to iti cell or godi media is tasviir kaa swaagat karata? kya ek loktantric desh main ye hona chahie? kya ye dekhakar aapako acha lag rahaa he? dilli police ne is par koi safai di he? yaa aaraam se is sawaal ko kinare laga diya gaya? kya kisi khaas vajah se jamiya ko target kiya gaya? vajah bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Need to know that Jamia is also like Delhi University where students of all religions and localities study
 50 pratishat ke kareeb chaatr chatraayen yahaan gaiyr muslim hai
 There is no student union here for 13 years
 jab chaatr sangh tha to paanch gaiyr muslim adhyaksh rahe hai
 Now we come to a big news which could not be seen from the police to the Vice Chancellor
 vaais chancelar nazama akhtar ko kya yah pataa nahin tha ki unke chaatr kaa, safadarajang aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he? aspataal kaa kahana he ki goli lagi he, lekin police ke sutara kehete hai ki pataa karnaa hoga, rabar bullate ho saktaa he
 But Parimal was told by a medical superintendent that the bullet was fired
 zaahir he itnaa to pataa hoga hi
 Still three people are injured by the bullet
 rabar bullate ho yaa bullate se
 All three are safe
 enditivi ke parimal kumaar or sukirti ne na sirf inhen khoj nikaala balki baat bhi kii
 Did Vice Chancellor Najma Akhtar not have this student with her? Why did the police and VC hide that Jamia's student had a bullet? One student is Ijaz and one is Tamin
 ejaz jamiya kaa chaatr he
 He is shot in the chest but is out of danger
 tameen ko paanv main goli lagi he jise ab chuttee de di gai he
 He is not a student
 police ne kaha ki koi firing nahin hui he phir goli kahaan se ai
 It is not clear whether rubber bullets are hit or bullets or tear gas pellets are installed
 sukirti ne jisase baat kii usne kaha he ki vah guzar rahaa tha
 Is not a student of Jamia
 jab campus main police thi tab najma akhtar ne hinsa rukvane ke liye kise sandesh bheje? kisase baat kii? kah rahi hai ki police ne unase ijazat nahin lee
 That is, they would not have talked to the police, then how was the VC saying on Sunday that the police came to the campus, rushing outsiders? Today she was calling the police action barbaric, but did she go to see the injured students at night? Went to meet the detained students? According to the police, a medical legal certificate of 39 students has been made, i
e
 those who have been injured so many have been treated
 hamaare sahyogi sharad sharma ne bataaya ki holi family main 45 chaatr aae the jinhen praathmik upachaar ke baad chuttee de di gai
 Currently three students are admitted
 okhla ilaake ke al shipha aspataal main 70 se adhik chaatr ghayal avasthaa main laae gaye
 Most left after first aid
 sharad ne ek chaatr se baat kii
 According to police, 4 buses were burnt in 20 minutes
 police ne afvaah bataaya he ki jawan bas jala rahe the
 According to police, 30 policemen were injured
 do esechao ko fracture hua he
 The case is being investigated
 jamiya ke jis chaatr ko goli lagi thi uske video gum rahe the
 Still the police did not bother to confirm
 jamiya kii visi ne pataa karne kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 It is a matter of fact that the students of Jamia took the initiative themselves and started sending tramme messages on Sunday evening
 agar hinsa se pehle internet or phone band hota to aap kalpana nahin kar sakate ki ravivaar kii shaam vahaan kya hua hota
 Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Association and teachers called for ITO to run
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr or shikshak bhi pahunch gaye
 This was the pressure that the students detained at night were released
 harshamandar or vakil choudhary ali zia kabir thane gaye
 Jamia's teachers also reached
 kaaphi baatcheet ke baad inhen chaatro se milane diya gaya
 Met about 28 students
 chaatro ne inhen bataaya ki vah librari main padhai kar rahaa tha
 He has been killed
 aap sisitivi camera dekh len to dikhegaa ki kaise chaatro ko maaraa gaya jab ve pard rahe the
 The students said that the girls were chased to the toilet by lighting the lights
 unke saath kathith rup se chhedhkhani hui jisaki jaanch honi chahie
 The daytime jamia looked like this
 maanav runkhalaa banaakar khadey ho gaye
 There was also a banner
 kuch chaatro ne munh par haath rakh liya
 Even today, slogans were raised
 chaatro ne puraa khyaal rakhaa ki hinsa na ho
 Nor did the police do anything like this today
 das chaatro ne itani thand main shart utaar kar protest karnaa shuru kar diya
 Shiva was one of them
 inkaa kahana tha ki ve is tarah se satyagrah kar rahe hai
 When the matter reached the court, the Chief Justice said that violence would first stop and then a hearing would be held
 jamiya kii abhi khabar puri tarah se ai bhi nahin thi ki aligarh se tasviren aane lageen
 As soon as the news of Jamia incident reached, the students started going out and shouting slogans in support of Jamia at Aligarh University
 dijipi o pi singh ne kaha ki eemyu ke vaais chancelar ne hi likhit rup se campus main aane kii ijazat di thi ki agar zarurat pade to campus ke andar uchit bal kaa istamaal kar sakate hai
 Did the inner conditions get so bad? amu's Sir Syed was blocking students from one side of the gate and the police was pushing from the other side
 internet band hone se pehle yah video aa gaya varanaa aap nahin dekh pate ki visi kii ijazat se police aise bheetar aati he
 Some photos also came in which the young man of the police is closing the gate of Girls College
 chaatro kaa aarope he ki police ne hastal main ghuskar maaraa he
 Sticks charged
 aansu gas ke gole chode gaye
 The students have been given two days to vacate the hostels
 times of india kii khabar ke anusaar ek chaatr kaa dahinaa haath aansu gas ke gole ke kaaran fat gaya he
 Now his hand will not be able to return because the situation is very bad
 chaatr chemistry kaa research scollar he
 He is not in a position to talk
 zila aspataal ke chikitsa adhikari ne kaha ki 20 chaatro ko laayaa gaya tha
 Most of which have been omitted
 police ko bhi chotein ain hai
 FIR has been filed against many students
 eemyu 5 janvari tak ke liye band he
 What will you say after watching this video, you must have seen that the police is breaking the bike with sticks
 baad main yahi tuuti hui bike police kii kahaniyon ke kirdaar ban jaati he ki koi kisi gyaat yaa agyaat ne danga kiya
 No one had any idea that students and teachers would start marching in twenty-five universities of the country as soon as they heard the news of Jamia
 poster binar lekar khadey ho jaaenge
 The readiness of the students of JNU began to support Jamia rapidly
 wo raat ko hi sadak par aa gaye
 Think of it in a way, are these students not good that with the topper in education, they also come out immediately for democratic rights, do you really not want any fighter for your rights? Who told you that only the leaders will fight for your rights and the police, when did you decide this? dilli vishvavidlaay main bhi chaatro ne jamiya ke samarthan main awaz uthaai he
 There have also been clashes between supporters of Jamia and ABVP near the Maths department
 lakhanu ke daarul ulum nadwatul ulema ke chaatr bhi jamiya main hui police hinsa ke samarthan main ravivaar raat ko hi baahar nikal kar pradarshan karne lage
 The university has been closed till January 5 due to their raging
 mumbai ke tata instistuute of soshal science ke chaatr raaton raat hi baahar aa gaye or naare lagane lage
 Candles began to march
 tiss ke chaatro ne somvaar ko class kaa bahishkaar kiya
 Marched from Tiss Main Gate to Ambedkar Park in Chembur
 puure din main bhi tiss ke chaatro or shikshakon ne jamiya ke samarthan main pradarshan kiya
 TISS students performed throughout the day on Monday
 mumbai uniwarsity main bhi protest hua he
 Organizations and students of the Banaras University, Indian Institute of science-bangalore, expressed support
 iaiti madras, iaiti bambe, aaliyah uniwarsity, jadhavpur uniwarsity, kolkata uniwarsity or presidency uniwarsity, hyderabad main bhi moulana azaad neshnal urdu uniwarsity ke chaatr chaatraon ne bhi badi sankhya main pradarshan kiya he
 Protests also took place at Patna University and violent incidents took place there
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 16 disambar kii sari parikshaayen radd kar deen, jo 10 janvari ko hoga
 The university closed for a day
 im ahmedabad ke chaatro ne bhi jamiya or aligarh main hui police hinsa ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya he
 Protests have been held against police brutality in Jamia at Punjab University Chandigarh, Central University of Kerala, Central University of Pondicherry, Pune's Savitri Bai Phule University
 kya aapako vaaki lagata he ki itane saare chaatr kisi algaavvaadi ke bahekaave main aae hai? kya itnaa aasaan he pradarshan karne vaale chaatro ke andolan ko jihadi or algaavvaadi kah dena? vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman kaa bayaan suniye or ye bayaan pradhanmantri ko sunanaa chahie
 According to PTI, the Finance Minister has said that we should beware of those jihadis, Maoists and separatists who can hijack students' performances
 pradhanmantri modi or grahamantri amit shah ne chaatro se dhiraj rakhane kii apil kii he
 Shouldn't both appeal to Nirmala Sitharaman and Rakesh Sinha not to do such a thing
 rajyasabha saansad rakesh sinha ne jamiya kii ghatana ke baad twit kiya ki yah 1947 kaa bharat nahin 2019 kaa he
 Direct action will not work
 unke twit kii bhashaa aalochana kii nahin sidhe-sidhe dhamkee kii thi
 Should this be the language of a Rajya Sabha MP? Will the Prime Minister be able to say something to Rakesh Sinha that, comparing direct action, you should not tell the students of Jamia to be Muslims, whose foundation was laid by Mahatma Gandhi? Alt News has investigated the tweeted video of BJP social media chief Amit Malviya
 yah kah kar is video ko ghumaya gaya ki eemyu ke chaatr hinduon ke khilaaf naare laga rahe hai
 But when Alt News searched for a better quality clip of the same video, it was found that the students were shouting slogans of Hindutva
 hinduon ke khilaaf nahin
 Hindutva refers to BJP politics
 lekin hindu dharm kaa bataa kar bhadakaau banane ke is prayaas ke khilaaf dilli police ection le sakegi? wo agar afvaahon vaali video khoj rahi he to kya yah video use dikhaai degaa?hinsa se chaatro ko bhi bachanaa chahie
 It is also their responsibility
 pradarshan kii ugrata is makaam par pahunchane na den ki hinsa kii sambhaavna dikhne lage or naaron kii bhashaa main sanyam rakhana hi hoga
 The performance in Mau of UP is reported to be furious
 yah ugrata puure virodh ko sanak main badal degi or phir virodh karne kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 Narendra Modi, speaking for the first time on the controversy of Vajpayee's edict given during the 2002 riots, said that the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee never gave him directions in the case of Rajdharma
 narendra modi ne kaha ki vaajapeyi ji ne jo bhi kaha tha vah you-tub par uplabdh he
 Anyone can listen
 unhone aisa kuch nahin tha
 Narendra Modi said this while addressing a rally in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki vaajapeyi ji yah kaha tha ki rajdharm kaa paalan hona chahie, jo aap kar rahe hai
 Narendra said this after an allegation by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 Meanwhile, Intelligence Agency officials are questioning former Finance Minister Chidambaram at CBI headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday

 america raashtrapati donald trump kii bacchon evam abhibhavak se judi niti kamjor padati najar ai he, trump kii patni or america kii pratham mahila melania trump ne hi uski aalochana kii he
 The policy is about the separation of migrant mothers and their children on the US border
 purv republican raashtrapati jorge dablyoo bush kii patni laura bush ne bhi maujuuda america raashtrapati kii niti par nishaanaa sadhate hue, bacchon ke unke mata-pita se alag hone ke kadam ko krur or aniatik bataaya he
 He also said that this frustrates his mind
 grih suraksha vibhaag ke aankadon kii agar baat kii jaae to 19 april se 31 may ke bich kareeb 2,000 bachche apane mata-pita evam abhibhavak se alag hue hai, jinhen kuch vishesh kendron main rakhaa gaya he
 This is due to the President Trump's policy of not tolerating even a little
 is mudde par america main bahes us vakt tej ho gai jab mata-pita se algaav jhel rahe bacchon kii tasviren or kahaniyaan logon ke saamne ai, jisaki upaj trump kii vivaadit avrajan niti ke kaaran hui
 Very little is seen when Melania expresses her opinion on such policy issues
 yah niti unhen is kadar khatki ki apni pravaktaa ke jariye unhone kaha ki bacchon ko unke pariwaron se alag hote dekhne se unhen nafrat he
 Melania's Director of Communications Stephanie Grisham also said that we needed to be a country that would follow all the laws
 lekin aisa desh bhi bananaa he jahaan shashan dil se chalata ho
 Grisham, herself an immigrant, said through Melania that she hoped the two sides would come together for successful immigration reform
 bush newashingtonpost main ek aalekh likhakar kaha he, ‘main ek seemaayi rajya main rahati hum
 i recognize the need to protect our international borders, but this policy of not tolerating at all is cruel
 yah aniatik he
 It breaks my heart
 ’ saath hi unhone kaha, ‘hamaari sarkaar ko bacchon ko box store main rakhane ke kaam main shaamil nahin hona chahie or na hi el paso ke baahar registan main tambu daalkar rakhana chahie
 These photos are reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, which are now counted among the most embarrassing incidents in American history
 ’trump prashasan kii niti ke tahat ab avaidh rup se seemaa paar karte paae jane vaale har vayask vyakti par sangheey aparaadhon kaa cese darj kiya jaataa he

 On the question of who should hold his party responsible for the return of Congress to power in Karnataka after a long time, he said that people have given this mandate and their party cannot do anything in it

 ' a top official of an American Commission on Religious Freedom has said that India's top leadership should speak more fiercely against the fiercest statement
 bharat dwaara unhen ek swatantra sanstha kii sadsy ke taur par vija jari karne se inkaar kiye jane ko unhone ek bade avasar ko ganvaaya janaa bataaya he
 US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) Commissioner Katrina Lantos Swet said that India is the world's largest democratic country with a population of one hundred twenty five crore
 unhen ab maanavadhikaron ke sangrakshan par gaur karne vaale america ayog ke ayuktaon or peshewaron ko ijaajat dene main kuch rakshaatmak hona chahie, lekin mere vichaar se isse kamajori jaahir hoti he na ki majbootee
 Lantos Swet said, 'I find it somewhat incomprehensible and missing a great opportunity from India
 ' This is the third time since 2001 and 2009, when India has failed to issue visas to USCIRF members
 unhone kaha ki bharat ek mahaan samaaj he or duniya ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn deshon main shaamil he
 He said that one should also hope that a democratic and pluralistic society like India would welcome the commission's visit
 bharat sarkaar dwaara liya gaya faisla rakshaatmak he
 Lantos Swet said that some Indian states have very complex laws and communal violence towards religious minorities is a matter of great concern
 unhone kaha ki agar ugr bayanon ke khilaaf sheersh netritv kahin adhik prakhar ho to ve iskaa swaagat karenge
 This commission is an independent government commission whose commissioners are appointed by the US President as the leader of both houses of Congress
 tippaniyan However, in response to a question, Lantos Swet welcomed some statements made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on ensuring religious freedom
 unhone kaha, 'ham uskaa swaagat or saraahna karte hai
 But it would be fair to say that we think he can do more
 '(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from the Syndicate feed)
 antarrashtriya dharmik swatantraaa par america ayog (yuassiaiaref) kii ayukta katrina laantos sweate ne kaha ki bharat ek sau pachchis karod kii aabaadi vaala duniya kaa sabase bada loktantric desh he
 They should now be somewhat defensive in allowing the commissioners and professionals of the American Commission to look into the protection of human rights, but in my view it shows weakness and not strength
 laantos sweate ne kaha, 'main ise kuch-kuch samaj se pare or bharat kii ore se ek shandaar avasar ganvaane ke rup main paati hum
 ' saal 2001 or 2009 ke baad yah teesraa mauka he, jab bharat yuassiaiaref ke sadasyon ko vija jari karne main naakaam rahaa he
 He said that India is a great society and is included in the most important countries of the world
 unhone kaha ki kisi ko bhi yah aashaa kerani chahie ki bharat jaisaa ek loktantric or bahultavaadi samaaj ayog kii yatra kaa swaagat karegaa
 The decision taken by the Government of India is defensible
 laantos sweate ne kaha ki kuch bhartiya rajyon main bahut hi jatil kanoon hai or dharmik alpsankhyakon ke prati sampradayik hinsa badi chintaa kii baat he
 He said that he would welcome it if the top leadership was more fierce against the fiercest statements
 yah ayog ek swatantra sarkari ayog he jiske ayuktaon ko america raashtrapati congress ke donon sadanon ke netaa niyukt karte hai

 PM Modi fiercely attacked the Congress party during the rally in Goa
 unhone is dauraan kaha ki congress ne to dephence dils main aise khel khele hai ki desh ke vir javaanon ke parakram ko hi laachaar kar diya 
 There was no defense deal under the Congress rule, which was not under suspicion
 piem modi(pm Modi) ne kaha ki inhone boforce main dallali khai or dalal kwatroki mamaa ko bhaga diya
 The result was that for decades our army could not even get a new cannon
 kyonki congress ke paap kaa hissedaar koi nahin bananaa chahta tha
 He (PM Modi) said that when Army talked about the purchase of Rafael, then special brokers of Namdar families of Congress also got involved in it
 parinaam ye hua ki deal varshon se ataki rahi or sena kii shakti ghatati rahi
 Then before 2014, in the midst of an atmosphere of scandal, the Congress closed the box of Rafael
 helicopter ghotaale main khub dallali chali
 The way was the same, the Bofors one
 congress ne mishael mamaa jaise dallalon ko videsh bhaga diya
 He felt that the matter would be suppressed as he had driven away Quattrocchi
 inako ye zaraa bhi aihsaas nahin tha ki chaukeedaar aayega or inke bhagaae har bichauliye ko pataal se bhi dhundhakar laaegaa
 PM Modi said that slowly the truth of all the scams is coming out
 dallali ke taar jud rahe hai
 During this, he also attacked Congress leader Ahmed Patel
 unhone kaha ki AP or family ko kitna maal mila, ye saamne aa rahaa he
 During his address, PM Modi also remembered late Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar
 unhone (PM Modi) kaha ki aaj aise samay main aapke bich aayaa hum jab desh ke ek mahaan sapoot, goa ke vikaas ke liye samarpit, mere mitra manohar parrikar ji, hamaare bich nahin hai
 With his dedication, how can a person honestly work in public interest through his labor, Parrikar Ji showed this
 samaaj ke har varg ke liye sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas ke maarg par chalate hue, kaise kaam hota he, ye parrikar ji karke dikhaaya
 PM Modi said that while being the Defense Minister of the country, the dedication with which Manohar Parrikar worked for the decisions of the nation's soldiers, for the defense of the nation, is incomparable
 unke rahete hui sargical strike ne nae bharat kii nai reeti, nai niti kii neenv rakhi he
 He said that i am proud to have the opportunity to give a new direction to the Defense Doctrine of India with a partner like Manohar
 piem modi ne is dauraan kaha ki atal ji kii sarkaar ne desh ke shaheedon ke liye ek maanviya faisla liya tha
 Today, the bodies of the martyrs who come home in the coffin did not happen before
 sarkari bainkon ko majboot karne ke liye kendra sarkaar ko mega plan ke tahat 80 hajaar rupye atirikt kharch karne kii manjuuri loksabhaa se mil chuki he
 Under the Mega Plan to strengthen the economy of the country, the Central Government 2
 1 lakh karod rupee ke karj tale dabe sarkari bainkon ko march 2018 tak 80 hajaar karod rupee dene kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Now this proposal is being debated in Rajya Sabha
 gauratlab he ki oktober 2017 main vitt mantri arun jetali ne sarkari bainkon ke ricapiteligeshan ko manjuuri de di thi
 Therefore, by giving additional funds of Rs 80 thousand crore to sick banks, efforts will be made to create new jobs along with increasing credit growth in the country
 is fund ke jariye sarkari bainkon ko agle do saal ke andar 2
 Capital of 1 lakh crore rupees to be collected
 bainkon ke is torget main 1
 35 million crore recapitalization bonds are also included
 ise padhein: sarkari bainkon ke vilay se pehle unke enpie kaa samaadhaan jaruri: raghuram rajankendra sarkaar dwaara is fund kaa sabase bada phayda in bainkon ko milegaa
 State Bank of India Gross NPA (non Performing Asset) 9
 8 fisadi, united bank enpie 12
 4 per cent, UCO Bank NPA 19
 7 fisadi, dena bank enpie 17
 2 percent, etc
 is nae fund ke jariye ghate main chal rahe bainkon ko madad pahunchaana sarkaar ke liye majaburi ban gai he kyonki jahaan march 2015 main in bainkon kaa enpie 2
 75 lakh crores which increased to 7 by June 2017
 33 lakh karod rupee se adhik ho gaya he
 That change took place in the BJP, which was not known to many people
 nitin gadakari waapas nagpur pahunch gaye or rajnath singh ko gajiabad se dilli bula liya gaya, lekin, yah abhi saaf nahin hua he ki ahmedabad se dilli kii flite pakadaney kaa intazaar karne vaale narendra modi ko 'concermd' tikat kab milegaa
 
 
 Last week was very important for BJP
 gadakari kii vidaai or rajnath kii tajposhi se kai sanket mili
 It became clear that the hold of the RSS on the BJP organization would remain strong and there would be no relaxation in it, because the RSS had made it clear that the BJP president would either remain Gadkari or become Rajnath Singh
 doosraa, aresas ke chaahane ke baavjood laalkrishna adwani sanyas lene ko taiyaar nahin, balki gadakari kii vidaai main adwani ne jis tarah badi bhoomika nibhaai, usase party kaayakartaaon or hitchintakon main unka kad phir bad gaya he
 Advani has removed Bijpi by not only giving Gadkari an opportunity to be aggressive on the UPA on the issue of corruption, but has also succeeded in stopping the party's declining credibility on this issue
 lekin bada sawaal yahi he ki rajnath singh kii tajposhi narendra modi ke liye acchhee khabar he yaa buree
 
 
 In Rajnath Singh's previous tenure, the relationship between the two leaders was not good
 rajnath singh ne modi ko party kii sarvocch nirnaayak sanstha sansadeey board se hataa diya tha
 Rajnath was also instrumental in declaring Advani as the nda's prime ministerial candidate just before the Gujarat elections of 2007, and Modi supporters alleged that it was trying to divert attention from Modi in the Gujarat elections and stall his path after victory
 It was an attempt
 lekin, ab agar rajnath singh badale nazar aa rahe hai, to modi bhi
 
 
 This time Narendra Modi specially invited Rajnath for his Vivekananda visit just before the Gujarat elections, which was a pleasant surprise for Rajnath
 gujarat jane par rajnath kaa modi ne garmjoshi se swaagat bhi kiya
 After he became president, he congratulated her on the phone and reminded her on Twitter that Rajnath is the biggest farmer leader in the country
 rajnath singh se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya bijepi narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaegi to is par unka jawaab yahi tha ki is bare main sansadeey board uchit samay par faisla karegaa, lekin lage haath rajnath ne modi kii jabardast tarif kar daali
 He said that Modi is a national leader and has created a model of development in Gujarat
 baad main unhone yah bhi kaha ki rashtriya str par modi ke role ko tay karne ke liye vah unase or party ke duusare netaaon se baatcheet karenge
 The role of the chairman of the National Campaign Committee for Modi is being talked about, but it does not seem that Modi will be ready for it
 
 
 balki jab tak modi ko thos rup se 'bijepi kaa cheharaa' banane kaa faisla nahin hota, modi gujarat chhodkar baahar nikalnaa bhi nahin chahenge
 Contrary to the news in some parts of the media, the RSS has made up its mind to hand over a big role to Modi
 sutron ke mutabik disambar ke antim saptaah main sangh kii ek andruni baithak main aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Timing is a big decision in politics
 modi ko aupchaarik rup se bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kaa matlab yah he ki bihar main nitish kumaar kaa saath kho dena
 
 
 That is why party leaders want to find a middle ground by making him head of the campaign committee, but Modi wants that whatever responsibility he is given, he should be given without any hindrance
 yahi rajnath ke liye ek badi pariksha he ki vah is sawaal kaa samaadhaan kaise karte hai
 The question is also that Rajnath Singh has more political weight than light-weight Gadkari
 unki pradhanmantri banane kii mahatvakankshaayen chhipi nahin hai
 Although he is now saying that he is not in the race for the post of PM, and will focus his entire strength on strengthening the organization, but balance between power and organization is rare
 khaastaur se tab, jab sanghathan kii chaabi kisi or (aresas) ke paas ho

 After this appointment, Prashant Kishore was also made a member of the Vihar Development Mission

 But in the last eight months, Prashant Kishore came to Bihar only once or twice, so what advice he would have given to the Chief Minister can be estimated
 jimmedaari nahin nibhaa rahe hai prashantsushil kumaar modi ne kaha ki bihar vikaas mishan kii ab to maatr do baar hi baithak hui
 Prashant Kishore was absent in the last meeting which was held on May 21, 2016
 For the last four months, Prashant Kishore has not visited Bihar even once
 iskaa bahut bada kaaran ye he ki ek saath ve upi or punjab jaise rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye congress ke salaahkaar bane hue hai
 Modi said that the information is also that Prashant Kishore has also been appointed by Jagmohan Reddy as advisor for the elections in Andhra Pradesh
 teen rajyon main chunaav kii jimmevary hone ke kaaran prashanth kishor mukhyamantri ke paramarshi ke dayitvon kaa nirvahn sahi dhang se nahin kar paa rahe hai, aise main unhen apane pad par rahane kaa koi moulik adhikaar nahin he

 paramarshi kaa pad mukhya sachiv se upar kaa pad hota he
 Prashant Kishore has tied up with political parties in three states to advise on elections, in which crores have been signed
 bihar main ye praavdhaan he ki jis kisi ko mantri kaa darja praapt hota he use apni sampatti kaa byoraa dena hota he
 But Prashant Kishore has not yet given details of his assets
 prashanth kishor ko apni sampatti kaa byoraa dena chahie
 Raised on payment, SALBJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi directly questioned Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that he should tell Bihar's Janaka what counseling Prashant Kishore gave in the last eight months? When no work is done on the vision document, then to Citizen Alliance 9
 31 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kyon kar diya gaya? unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se poocha ki jab prashanth kishor apane dayitvon kaa nirvahn kar hi nahin paa rahe to phir unhen is pad par banaakar kyon rakhaa gaya he?prashanth kishor ne aaropon ko nakarabihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ke dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon ko prashanth kishor ne ek sire se khaarij kiya
 Prashant Kishore, an advisor to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, said that he would send legal notices to Sushil Kumar Modi for making false allegations
 unhone kaha ki chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan bhi unhone is tarah ke aarope lagaae the jis par unako kanoonee notish bheja gaya tha
 Prashant Kishore said that the documents of the report of 40 thousand villages of Bihar have been submitted to the IPRD department a month ago
 unhone susheel kumaar modi se kaha ki aap apana cameraman bhejkar us report kaa video bana sakate hai
 Continuing the work of creating the vision document, Prashant Kishore said that as far as the payment to the jwt-citizen Alliance company is concerned, these payments have been made from the district level after thorough scrutiny of the documents
 abhi bhi saat se aath jilon ko bhugtan karnaa baaki hi he
 He said that on the basis of the report of these forty thousand villages, as far as the making of the vision document is concerned, this responsibility has been given to the government agency of Bihar and not to Citizen Alliance
 prashanth kishor ne kaha ki unka kahin se koi sambandh citigen elanyas naam kii company se nahin he
 Also, there has never been any transaction between him and Citizen Alliance Company
 prashanth kishor ne susheel modi dwaara uthaae gaye ek-ek aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki jahaan tak paramarshi ke pad kaa sawaal he to maine pehle din se likhit rup main kaha ki ve kisi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin lenge
 Once again, soon after receiving the command of the Communist Party of China, Chinese President Xi Jinping has started work on his new plan for India
 is baar china ne apane seemaayi kshetra kii suraksha ke liye tibet ke charavaahon par daanv khelaa he
 Jinping has asked the shepherds living in Tibet to build settlements near the indo-china border and protect the Chinese territory
 news agency ke mutabik, tibet ke lunjhe sthit ek parivaar kii do betiyon ne shi jinping ko patr likhakar apane kasbe kii aap beeti bataai thi, jiske jawaab main shi ne unhen bharat-china seemaa kshetra ke paas baseraa daalane ko kaha he
 In the Lunjhejis area near Arunachal, Xi Jinping has asked the shepherds to settle in
 It is actually bordering southwest China and close to India's Arunachal Pradesh
 is ilaake par china apana daawa karata he or ise dakshini tibet kahata he
 It is being told that Xi Jinping has asked a family of shepherds to settle the border area, protect the sugar area and expand the settlement there
 ye bhi daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki jinping ne kshetra kii suraksha ke liye parivaar ke prayaason ko sweekaara or simavarti kshetra main unki vafadari or yogadan ke prati aabhaar jataayaa he
 When he became party general secretary, he said that Xi Jinping had asked his army to be ready after being re-elected general secretary of the Jinping Communist Party of China (CPC)
 shi ne apane udghaatan sambodhan main kaha tha ki china padosiyon ke saath seemaa vivaad sulajhane ke liye taiyaar he, lekin vah apni samprabhutaa or akhandta ko chunauti dene vaali chizon ko sahan nahin kar saktaa
 In such a situation, this attitude of China on the border of India associated with Tibet, not only reflects its expansionist policy, it also shows that every possible preparation is made to occupy the area which China claims as its own
 isse pehle haal hi main china or bharat ke bich sikkim main doklam ko lekar do maheene se zyada vivaad chalaa
 At the same time pictures of skirmishes between the armies of the two countries were revealed in Ladakh

 " Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan created controversy by saying that the Rajya Sabha should be abolished, because a large amount of money is being spent to become its member, making this upper house of Parliament like a 'market' It is done
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne haalanki yah bayaan dene ke kuch hi ghante baad iske liye khed jataate hue kaha ki rajyasabha jaise sanvaidhanik sansthaaon main unki gahari aasthaa he
 Chauhan indirectly mentioned Vijay Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher Company, and said that people from 'kingfisher' are coming to Rajya Sabha
 maalya ke anya kshetron ke alaava sharaab or uddyan udyog main vyapaarik hit hai duusari baar rajyasabha saansad bane hai
 The BJP leader said sarcastically, "those who spend make a kind of investment which they take out later
 ’’ unhone madhya pradesh vidhansabha main chunaav sudhaaron par kshetreey paricharchaa main kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki samay aa gaya he jab rajyasabha ko samaapt kar diya jaae jiske liye pratyaashee badi raashi kharch karte hai
 Instead, the quota for Rajya Sabha members should be fixed in the Lok Sabha itself
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘rajyasabha sadsy banane ke liye pratyaashee baari rakam kharch kar rahe hai
 He said that people with money power are willing to enter the upper house of Parliament
 chouhan ne kaha, ‘‘rajyasabha kii kya zarurat he? desh main pehle se hi loksabhaa jaisi shaktishaalee sanstha he jise janata dwaara chune gaye janpratinidhi chalaate hai
 The Rajya Sabha was formed for such people who could not contest elections
 masalan vaigyanik, kalakaar, lekhak or buddhijivi
 But now Kingfisher's people are reaching the Rajya Sabha
 ’’haalanki baad main jaldbaaji main raat main apane awaas par yojit samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘‘chunaav sudhaar par din main yojit ek sangoshtee main maine kuch kaha tha
 i am concerned about maintaining the prestige of the state legislatures, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak rajyasabha kaa sawaal he, yah ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he, iske liye or isamen sadasyon ke liye mere man main bahut sammaan he
 If people have taken my statement otherwise, i regret it
 ’’ mukhyamantri ne is bare main koi bhi prashn kaa uttar dene se inkaar kar diya
 Chauhan, pointing to Mallya's presence in the Rajya Sabha, said, "sometimes Kingfisher's people are reaching the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha tikat kii khuli bikri ho rahi he, yah ek bazaar sareekha ban gaya he, yah ek shame kii baat he
 Expressing his views, he said, "in place of the Rajya Sabha elections, a system should be made in which the anglo-indians are nominated to Parliament
" unhone kaha ki desh main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav paanch varsh par ekasaath karaaye jaayan
 He said that developmental activities are being affected by repeated elections, because the election code of conduct has to be implemented at the time of elections
 unhone saath hi chunaavon main kaledhan ke prayog par chintaa jataate hue kaha ki ise rokane ke liye kadam uthaaye jane chahie
 Emphasizing the need for government spending in elections, Chauhan said that the use of black money will be banned in elections
 unhone kaha, ‘‘koi bhi party bina kosh ke nahin chal sakati
 Such an arrangement should be made that financial assistance for the party should be taken from the check itself

 31 oktober ko film kaa thri-di trailor launch kiya gaya he
 Its trailer released earlier received 20 million views in 24 hours
 ise ab tak 50 million se zyada log dekh chuke hai
 Now with 3D trailers, filmmakers have tried to make it more special

 @filmpadmavatia post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) onoct 29, 2017 at 11:23 pm PDT The most challenging role is on the comparison of Padmavatipadmavati's role with Mastani, Deepika says the battles between Mastani and Padmavati are quite different
 padmavati main hamane shaareerik khubsuurati se zyada saahas or parampara kii sundarataa dikhaai he
 Padmavati's character has been more challenging for me than Mastani
 baari-bharkam kapadon or gahanon main shoot karte vakt kaisaa laga? is sawaal ke jawaab main deepika ne kaha, ' jab aap sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath karte hai, to aapako din nahin ginaney padate
 As soon as the camera is on, you forget the weight of the lehenga
 mujhe bhi kabhi mahasoos nahin hua ki ghumar song ke dauraan mere sir par teen kilo kaa borala rakhaa he yaa maine kitne baari gahane pahane hai
 When Bhansali speaks action, the entire focus shifts from the costume to the character
 shoot ke baad maaloom padataa he ki kitna dard hua or kitni chot lagi
 'padmavati' has become excessively long, will be removed for some three years, i am Padmavati's role Mendipika told that she has worked hard for this role
 beete 2-3 saalon se wo padmavati kii kahani se judi hai
 For this, he has prepared himself not only physically but also mentally and emotionally
 'ghumar' ke liye sanjay lila bhansaali ne deepika ko diya sarprise giftunibro tha jokhim bharaa faislaunibro masale par deepika kaa kahana he ki darshakon ke liye sundarataa kii ek bandhi bandhai paribhaasha ban gai he, hamane padmavati ko shaareerik khubsuurati se alag dikhaane kii koshish kii he, ise jokhim uthaanaa kaha ja saktaa he, lekin padmavati kii khubsuurati isi main hai

 petrol or dijal kii keemton main ek baar phir aag lag gai he
 The rising international crude oil prices have brought diesel to a new record level in the country
 kareeb 43 maheenon baad desh main dijal 65 rupee ke paar pahunch gaya he
 65 in Mumbai for a liter of diesel on Friday

 pradhanmantri kii aarthik salaahkaar parishad ke chairman si rangarajan ne aaj yah raay jaahir kii
 Rangarajan said that the high prices of food items, however, remain a cause for concern and this is due to short supply
 lekin santosh kii baat yah he ki sarkaar ke paas khadyann kaa paryaapt bhandar he
 He said that there are signs that the rabi (winter) crop will be better
 unhone kaha ki saarvajanik vitaran pranali ke tahat zyada khadyann jari kiye jane se keemton main kami aegi
 In response to a question, Rangarajan said that there is no firm evidence that futures trading of agricultural commodities is increasing prices

 Ever since Pakistan's defeat, social media networks and former players, as well as government ministers, alleged that while chasing the target, Shahzad, along with Omar Akmal and Shoaib Malik, also deliberately slowed the batting
 in khilaadiyon kii photo kuch soshal netwarking site par daali gayi or afridi ke khilaaf gutbaji or shadyantr ke liye inhen jimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 We are all responsible for the defeat: Shahzad Shahzad said that there is no factionalism in the team and they all played like a team
 unhone kaha, ‘agar ham haare to iske liye ham sabhi jimmedaar hai or agar ham jitate jo iskaa shrey samuhik rup se hamen jaataa
 Shahzad said that he tried his best to score runs but destiny had written something else
 edilade testmen pehle din hi shatak lagane waleostralian ballebaaj david warnerne pehle din kaa khel khatm hone ke baad bataaya ki unhen apni pari ke dauraan lagaataar yah lagata rahaa ki huge duusare chor par khadey hokar meri ballebaaji dekhte hue muskura rahe hai
 David Warner, trying to recover from Hughes' death, also said that the 145-run knock in the first Test against India is his career-best innings and he will remember it throughout his life
 warner ke dasven test shatak kii madad se australia ne pehle din chah wicket par 354 ran banaaye
 "it's the best innings of my career," Warner said after the first day's play
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ummid he ki main bhavishya main kuch or shatak jamaa sakuunga lekin yah pari puri jindagi mere saath rahegaa
 Throughout the innings i kept feeling that my friend (hugh) was with me at the other end, with the first ball
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe pataa he ki vah duusare chor par hans rahaa hoga
 He would be surprised at the love and messages he received from all over the world and he could not believe it
 ’warner ne kaha ki unhone shuru main sochaa tha ki shatak kaa jashn nahin manaayenge
 He said, 'I thought i would not celebrate the century but i knew Hughes and he would want me to celebrate
 maaikel (clark) duusare chor par tha or usne kaha ki huge ko mujh par garv hoga
 He also raised his bat when he was on 37 not out
 ummid he ki maaikel kal aakar baaki ke ran banayega
 Talking about his innings, he said, "maybe i don't play this Test
 shuukravaar ko net par pehle abhyaas satr main meraa man nahin lag rahaa tha
 After that i did some practice
 main jajbaat par kaabo paane kii koshish main tha
 Warner said, "even after the match started, i was finding it difficult but i slowly got the rhythm
 main lunch tak krij par date rahanaa chahta tha
 He said that he is proud of his team which returned to the field after a tough period
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe in khilaadiyon par garv he jo maidan par aakar khilne kaa saahas juta sake
 Last week was tough for us
 ekajute hokar maidan par lautnaa hamaare liye gauravpurn pal tha
 Warner said, 'I am sorry that could not last
 maine koshish kii ki spinner ko ooncha shot nahin khelun lekin maine khelaa
 We have to score more and more runs now
 ’ maidan par do baar bhavuk hue warner ne kaha, ‘jab main 63 ran par tha to bheetar se bahut kharaab lag rahaa tha
 It was in my mind that this accident happened with Hugh on this score
 mujhe us score par rahanaa acha nahin lag rahaa tha or main jaldi aage badhanaa chahta tha lekin apane karier main hameshaa yah hamaare jehan main rahegaa
 It will be even more difficult to play at the Sydney Cricket Ground where the accident took place

 When a joint team of Intelligence Bureau, Bihar Police and Nepal officials raided the rented house of Yasin Bhatkal living in Pokhara, a neighboring country, on August 28, there was no wrinkle in the face of this leader of terror
 usne jor dekar kaha, ''main ejeeniyar hum
 You are catching the wrong man
 '' sidhe 200 se zyada bharatiyon kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar yaccin ne kanoon se lagaataar paanch saal tak chhupate rahane ke liye hameshaa yahi tikadam apanaai thi
 Yasin was blindfolded and taken to an unknown place and questioned
 usne lagaataar apni pahchaan chhupaai or khud ko pakistani passport dharak bataaya
 The deadlock came to an end when policemen broke his nose
 phir usne sari baaten kabool leen
 At present, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is citing Delhi with its biggest gripes and they are beginning to understand its importance
 ek guptchar adhikari bataate hai, ''ab tak hamane sirf pyaadon ko pakadaa tha
 The case of Yasin is different
 vah indian mujahidin (iem) ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se ek he
 He is the commander of IM, who used to direct other terrorists
 '' yaccin main kaaphi aatmavishvaas tha or use apane kiye par koi pachhtaawaa nahin tha
 The craze that we witnessed during the last five years has a particular trend: whether they have been tourists taking a cup of cold coffee in a German bakery in Pune, a small businessman in South Mumbai, or Dosa in Dilsukhnagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad
 Students going to eat, all became victims of his blasts
 jo maasoom bachche uske bam dhamaakon main maare gaye, unke bare main puche jane par usne kaha, ''to kya hua? log to har vakt marate hi rahete hai
 My job was to send a message to the Government of India
 main chaiyn se soya hum—apane pehle oparation se lekar aakhri tak mujhe kabhi bhi koi bura sapana nahin aayaa
 Yasin also cited texts in defense of his actions
 usne bhagavad gita kaa udhaaharan dekar kaha ki vah kisi kii jaan nahin le rahaa tha, balki atmaaon ko sadgati praapt karvaa rahaa tha
 a big IPS officer who questioned him calls him as ruthless as the Maoists, who persevere even by killing people
 ve kehete hai, ''apane kariyar main maine isse zyada kathor aatanki nahin dekha
 With the help of Yasin, the intelligence officers are able to avert other bomb attacks too
 masalan usne adhikariyon ko bataaya tha ki do aatanki—bihar ke samastipur kaa tahseem akhtar urf monu or pakistani aatanki vakaas bharat main ahm thikaanon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye ghus chuke hai
 Talking to him, officers are also getting information about the functioning of IM running from Karachi
 yaccin ke mutabik duniyabar main maujuud iem ke samarthak uske 'kam takat ke dhamaake karne' se naakhush hai
 Due to this, IM has been forced to form new teams to bomb important targets till the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaavon ke samay netaaon par sabase zyada khatra hota he
 He told that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was the biggest target because reaching him meant that the influx of money from supporters around the world would have increased
 lashkare taiyaba kii tarah iem ko bhi 26 / 11 ke hamale ke baad khub paisa mila tha
 a few days before Yasin's arrest, Karachi-based Riyaz Bhatkal (not a relative) paid him two lakhs from Hawala
 bhijwaaye the
 The agencies still have to investigate Yasin's claims of discontent and rift within the IM, but one thing to note is that a section within the IM is disgruntled and staunch, which stopped following the orders of its founders Iqbal and Riyaz Bhatkal And keeps in direct contact with their Pakistani masters
 yaccin se poochtacha main duusare aatanki maamle bhi hal hone kii sambhaavna ban rahi he, jaise july, 2006 main mumbai kii train main hue dhamaake, jisamen 209 log maare gaye the
 It is possible that during interrogation, the names of elements directing IM from across the border may also be revealed
 hedli ne bataai pakistan kii bhoomikasbse pehle david colman hedli ne bharat ke shaharon main bam dhamaakon kaa vivaran diya tha
 Headley was involved in the 26 / 11 attack
 america kii ek jail main enie ke chaar afasaron se baatcheet main 2010 main usne 'karachi project' par roshni daali thi
 Indian agencies had only a rough idea of a conspiracy going on since 2002
 sara abhiyaan pakistan ke sabase bade shahar se shuru hua, jahaan muslim naujavaanon ko bam banane main prashikshit kiya gaya taaki ve bhartiya shaharon main halki tivrata vaale aatanki hamale kar saken
 As the intelligence officer points out, these attacks had two objectives
 pehla makasad silsilewar dhamaakon se bhartiya arthvyavastha par hamalaa karnaa tha
 Also, to attack in such a way that Pakistan's involvement in it is not revealed
 hedli ne pakistani fouj ke ek ritred adhikari 45 varshiya major abdurrahman hashim kaa naam liya tha, jisane is project ko iesai ke kareeb laane kaa kaam kiya
 It is described as 'round-faced, lahim-shaheem' in the Major nia's Most Wanted list, which employs 'pasha' and Hafiz Saeed of jamaat-ud-dawa (JUD) in the list of India's 50 Most Wanted Fugitives It comes at number three after Sajid Mir, who was involved in 26 / 11 attack
 isane 2002 main pakistani fouj chodi thi, jiske baad lashkar ke liye fidaayin ko prashikshan dene kaa kaam kiya
 The work continued under the supervision of an ISI officer, identified by Headley as 'colonel Shah'
 abdurrahman 2008 main lashkar se alag ho gaya or swatantra rup se karachi kaa 'set ap' chalaane laga
 Rahman claimed that he was close to Osama bin Laden
 pakistani fouj main rahete hue usne 2001 main tora bora se bhaag rahe al kaayda ke ladaakon par hamalaa karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Rahman told Headley that the 2006 Mumbai train blasts were carried out by his 'boys' and bin Laden named his organization jund-ul-fida (army of fidayeen)
 rahamaan ne hedli ko bataaya tha ki uske ladke bhartiya noujvaan the
 One of the girls from Bhatkal came from Bhatkal, a town 140 km north of Mangalore in Karnataka
 yahaan kii macedoom colony main bhatkal ke ghar kii diwaar ke us paar se ek naaraaz mahila kii aawaaj aati he, ''jaao, baat nahin kerani he
 This response is not surprising
 jab kabhi koi aisa aatanki hamalaa hota he, jisamen iem kaa sandigdh haath bataaya jaataa he, patrkaar or pulisavaale isi ghar main aate hai
 This is the house where Ahmed Siddibapa alias Yasin Bhatkal's family lives
 jis aurat kii aawaaj hamane suni, vah yaccin kii maa rehana he
 Her brother-in-law, Yakub Siddibapa, says that she weeps throughout the day
 yaqub makaan ke sangemarmar vaale angan main ek kursi par baithe hai
 He says, "an acquaintance called me and informed me of Ahmed's arrest
" dekhie, main bhatkal main kitna mashhoor ho chukaa hum
 "most people remember that Ahmed" was a shy, good-looking and God-fearing boy who would not touch anyone's eye
 '' bhatkal ke ek samajakarmi nisaar ahamed kehete hai, ''maine ahamed ko yaa jaisaa aap media vaale kehete hai, yaccin ko kabhi aakraamak nahin dekha
 He was a patriot
 har rashtriya avkaash par jhanda fahraata tha

 ahamed ke saath padhe ek shaks hamase anurodh karte hai ki unki pahchaan na jaahir kii jaae varanaa khadi desh jane kii unki yojana mushkil main pad jaaegi
 He says, "when Ahmed was in 10th, i knew him
 vah bahut shant tha or apane se matlab rakhata tha
 "but as soon as Yasin's terrorist activities came to the headlines, his friend was picked up three times by the Mumbai ATS for questioning and once by the Bangalore police who picked him up so that he could identify Yasin in different hulia

 "yakub says," When Ahmed was in high school, he gave the first two papers, but the third paper was to Jumme, so he spent time in namaz in the mosque
 yah uski padhai kaa ant tha

 asif ko jise gujarat police ne 2002 main maar giraaya tha
 The ISI merged the banned SIMI, ARCF and the Bhatkal brothers' organization into IM in 2007, thus creating a domestic terrorist network to attack the country
 ab tak is project kaa thodaa khaakaa hi saamne aa sakaa he
 But it is certain that Yasin was a member of the initial consignment of Indian youth who were prepared in ISI training camps in remote areas of Balochistan, close to the Iranian border

 Yasin came to India via Nepal sometime in 2007, but it was difficult to get hold of him
 usne bhale hi schuli padhai bich main chhod di thi, lekin use acchhee kannada, angreji, urdu, hindi, farsi or bengali aati thi isliye vah ek shikshit vyakti kii tarah batch nikalataa tha
 Yasin was a master of detective activities

 He would change his address repeatedly and use his mobile only for a few seconds
 vah kabhi bhi ek sim card or ek mobile kaa do baar istemaal nahin karata tha
 In each of the 11 serial bomb blasts he has confessed to, he would have been living for months with a fake identity, inspecting the spot and eventually buying explosives and making ieds

 It is not yet known where Yasin lived in Kolkata

 It is clear that he used to take advantage of being close to Bihar and open border with Bangladesh and Nepal to get explosive material from here
 yah baat kolkata se jamaanat par chhootane ke kuch dinon baad hi usne sabit kar di thi, jab pune kii german bekri main sisitivi camere ne ek dadhi vaale noujvaan ko besabaal hat or peeth par bag laade hue kaid kiya tha
 On leaving, this man left his bag there

 a few months later in 2011, Yasin was in Mumbai

 Waqas was also with Imran
 13 july, 2011 ko dakshin mumbai main teen thikaanon par bam fate, jisamen 27 log maare gaye or 100 jakhmi hue

 In Shaheen Bagh area of the capital, he along with a man named Irshad Khan set up a bomb making factory
 irshaad ne apni 26 saal kii beti jaahida ko is baat ke liye raji kiya ki imran lakhanu kaa ek maikenical ejeeniyar he or donon kii shaadi kara di
 Here he was living like a namaji for five times and slept on the floor
 november, 2011 main jab police vahaan pahunchi to imran nadaarad tha
 During this time, he only made a concession by calling Zahida from the public booth and assured that he was just 20 km away from the house
 is saal may main nepal sthit ibi ke mukhabiron ne agency ko bataaya ki nepal ke pokhara main yaccin se miltaa-julata ek shaks dekha gaya he
 The IB has since taken him under his supervision
 vah laal bike chalaata tha, uske paas do laptop, chaar cellphone the or nakadi kii koi kami nahin thi
 Yasin did not shave off his beard despite repeated calls from his Pakistani masters
 yahi agency ke liye sakaaratmak rahaa

 On August 9, just before Eid this year, Yasin made another mistake
 usne nepal ke do mobile numberon se apni patni jaahida ko teen baar kol kiya or iske turant baad 1000 dollar use bheje
 The operation was closely monitored by IB director Asif Ibrahim
 aakhirkaar ibi or bihar police ke sanyukt oparation main use dhar liya gaya
 The strange thing was that the Bihar police had no eagerness to take Yasin into his custody
 unka ishaara tha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko chintaa he ki yaccin kii giraftaar unke muslim vot bank par asar daal sakati he
 Yasin's arrest has not ended the war against terror

 ''bataa den ki nil nitin mukesh haal hi main relies film saaho main najar aae the
 He had a negative character in the film
 film ko mix rivyus mili hai lekin box offis par yah tabadatod kamai kar rahi he
 The film stars Baahubali fame superstars Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor in lead roles
 film ne abhi tak indian box offis par 100 karod kaa aankada paar kar liya he
 Moin Ali had shown his stamina only in his short Test career of four matches
 in garmiyon main leeds main england srilanka ke khilaaf apni siries bachaane ke liye 350 ranon kaa peechha kar rahaa tha
 The 27-year-old Moeen remained unbeaten on 108 while the rest of his team's players returned cheaply to the pavilion, and not a single player had reached the half-century
 phir, bharat ke khilaaf southampton main unki team ko unke ranon kii jarurat hi nahin padi
 The team had already put up a mountainous score (569 for 7 wickets declared)
 lekin apni 12 ran kii pari main ali ne apni kalai par do band pahanakar cricket ke sansar ko khel or siyasat ke mail par kai sawaalon se rou-ba-rou kar diya ki aakhir maidan par sahanubhuti kaa pradarshan kis kadar sweekaarya ho saktaa he, or kaise khel kii takat kaa istemaal bhalaai ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) took a prudent and sympathetic view that Ali had not informed of wearing a band (save Gaza, save Gaza and liberate Palestine), but later prevented it
 did not go
 ek pravaktaa ne kaha, ''moin ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 "in this way, it was argued that he expressed human sympathy, not political
 (yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki falstini ilaakon ko aaazaad karne kii baat dvirashtriya samaadhaan main likhi gai he jis ke prati israel patibaddh bhi he, or ali koi krantikari, bhadakaau yaa kisi tarah kaa algaavvaadi sandesh nahin de rahe the
 ) But the International Cricket Council (ICC) did not agree with this plea and banned the band from wearing it
 aise main agar isisi kaa maananaa he ki khel or siyasat kaa ghalmail nahin hona chahie to yah baat kuch hajam nahin hoti
 How can i digest bisisiai kaa khajaana indian premier lig ko mana jaataa he, or jo isi vajah se isisi par niyantran rakhti he
 In the same league, Sri Lankan players were considered as a threat to not take the field in matches played in Chennai
 khel kii pehali jimmedaari hoti he khel bhaavana or aisa karke to khel bhaavana se hi munh mode liya gaya
 There is nothing like seeing the case of Basil d'olivera lightly here
 or dekhie naa! ipiel frenchijies ke liye nilaamee main pakistan ke pratibhavan khiladinnon ko koi kharidaar tak nahin miltaa
 In the case of the ECB, nothing can be more shaky when, a decade ago, he cut the trophy leaving Robert Mugabe the responsibility of playing World Cup matches in Zimbabwe on his own players
 nasir hossain ne apni aatmakatha main use apane jivan kaa ''sabase traasad daur” bataaya
 All these cases tell the story of BCCI and ECB running away from responsibility
 lekin sawaal yah nahin he ki cricket kaa maidan har tarah kii narebaaji kii khuli jagah he
 In fact, administrators need to adopt a more sympathetic attitude whether a message like this is justified or not
 darasal khel kaa maidan logon kii dilchaspee or saarvajanik najaare kii sabase aasaan jagah ban gaya he
 The players have set an example in this on their own level
 david vailechinsky ke olympic par nikaale sandarbh sangrah se ham jaan pate hai ki bharat ke champion hockey khilaadi 1936 main bhale berlin ke maidan main british jhanda lekar march karte dekhe gaye lekin dressing room main ve tirangaa hi laharaa rahe the (jo bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa jhanda tha)
 In 1968, three 200-meter athletes in Mexico City sacrificed their honors, in no way inferior to the record-setting great athletes Michael Johnson and Usain Bolt
 america ke tommy smith or jon carlos (swarna or kaansya vijeta) padak samaaroh main nange pair aae to unhone apane kaale dastaanon main lipati bahen hawa main laharaayin or ashwet takat ko salaam kiya, isse antarrashtriya olympic cameti main khalabali much gai
 Initially, the American Committee stood with him, but for fear of his other athletes being thrown out, he gave up his arms
 (smith or carlos ko rajat padak vijeta australian peter norman se jo samarthan mila, vah saahas kaa laajawab pradarshan tha
 ) It is said that players are not ordinary people like us
 lekin ve noujvaan or asaadhaaran stri-purush hote hai
 With his performance, he takes the audience far beyond their everyday worldliness
 jab ve koi pragatisheel kadam uthaate hai to unhen or hamen bhi yah jaananaa chahie ki vaisaa kyon nahin kar sakate
 And the boundary line between this and why cannot be drawn only when the administrators present strong arguments to their decisions
 isse yah samajhane main madad milegi ki kya karnaa chahie or kisase peeche hat janaa chahie
 After the extradition of middleman Christian Michel in agustawestland, now the Modi government is busy trying to bring businessman Vijay Mallya home
 landan ke court ne maalya ke bharat pratyrpan ko manjuuri bhi de di he
 India sees this as a big win
 haalanki maalya ke paas vahaan kii upree adaalat main apil karne ke vikalp maujuud hai
 If Modi government manages to bring Vijay Mallya to India then it will be considered a big victory for the government
 janata main yah massej jayega ki sarkaar ab desh ke saath dhokhadhadi karne vaale kisi aaropee ko nahin chhodeygi
 Also, Mallya's return will be a big relief for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 jab maalya ne liya jetali kaa namakyonki khud maalya ne bharat chhodane se pehle setlement ke liqurun jetalise mulaakaat kii baat kahi he or tabhi se jetali vipaksh ke nishane par hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has even accused Arun Jaitley of alleged help in driving Vijay Mallya out of India
 isliye jaise hi somvaar ko landan kii westminster magistrate kii court sevijay maalyaki pratyrpan ko manjuuri mili, khud arun jetali ne twit kar khushi jataai, unhone likhaa, 'aaj bharat ke liye bada din he
 No one who cheats India will escape punishment
 ek apradhi ko upie sarkaar ke dauraan phayda pahunchaaya gaya tha
 However, the NDA government is bringing it back
 'maalya kii vaapasi or 2019 kaa chunaav?arun jetali ke twit se saaf he ki maalya kii vaapasi se unke upar jo daag lage hai wo to dhulenge hi, saath hi vipaksh ko chup karaane ke liemodi sarkaarko bada hathiyaar haath lag jayega
 However, the government will try to somehow succeed in bringing Mallya to India before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 maalya kii vaapasi se sarkaar kii chhavi jo janata main thodi dhoomil hui he or chamak uthegi or phir loksabhaa chunaav main 'maalya kii vaapasi' 'sarkaar kii vaapasi' kii raah ko aasaan kar sakati he
 However, it is being said that Vijay Mallya can be brought back to India by the end of January
 court ne maalya ko upree adaalat main apil karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya he
 Meanwhile, seeing the tightening of the screws on Mallya, the attitude of Mallya has also started loosening, now he has started talking about refunding the banks
 court kii sunwaayee se pehle media se baatcheet main maalya ne kaha, 'maine kisi kaa paisa nahin churaayaa
 i talked about paying the entire money of the banks
 bakaayaa chukaane kaa pratyrpan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Whereas in a tweet, Mallya said, "as far as the bank's money is concerned, i have offered to return it 100 percent in full
" main puri vinamrata se bank or sarkaar se kahata hum ki ve paisa le len
 If my offer was rejected, then why? ”nirav Modi also gives radar, Vijay Mallya is facing the case of not paying the loan of 9,000 crore rupees of Indian banks
 vah apane khilaaf sibiai ke lukout notice ko kamjor kiye jane kaa phayda uthaate hue march 2016 main britain bhaag gaya tha
 Apart from Vijay Mallya, diamond merchants Nirav Modi and Rahul Chauksi are also on the radar of the Modi government
 SC se bhi maalya ko raahat nahinvahin desh kii sabase badi adaalat supreme court se bhi maalya ko jhatka lag chukaa he
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started the process of confiscating Vijay Mallya as a fugitive economic criminal and confiscating his assets
 jiske khilaaf vijay maalya ne apane vakil ke jariye supreme court main yachika daakhil kii thi, lekin court ne idi kii kaarywahi par roak lagane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 There is a hearing on Mallya in a London court that India has been trying to extradite Mallya for a long time
 isse pehle bhi sibiai samet duusare adhikaar landan ja chuke hai
 Even Mallya has been arrested in London, but got bail
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki chrishchiyan mishael kii tarah hi vijay maalya ko bharat laane main jaanch agenciyaan kab tak safal ho paati hai

 Kanhaiya Kumar questioned the government's attitude and said that poor students study in JNU so fees should not be increased

 The way in which fees have been increased in JNU, 40% out of 100 students will not be able to study
 ye 40 fisadi chaatr aise hai jinke parivaar kii masik aamadani 12 hajaar rupee he
 If the fee hike is implemented then JNU will become the most expensive Central University in the country
 phir jo chaatr garib-kisaan parivaar se aate hai, ve padhai nahin kar paaenge
 That is why the students of JNU are doing this movement
 ' fees vruddhi waapas lene ko lekarkanhaiya kumaarane kaha ki yah saraasar jhooth he kyonki isamen maamuli pherbadal kar ise hoobahoo lagu kar diya gaya he
 On a question related to the subsidy received by JNU students for the construction of the idol with taxpayers' money, Kanhaiya Kumar told India Today, "the mps who go to Parliament in this country have subsidy on their food, their stay is subsidized
" jahaan tak taxperes ke paise kii baat he to taxperes ke paise se 3 hajaar karod kii murti banaai ja rahi he, taxperes ke paise se mukhyamantri ke liye privet jet kharida ja rahaa he, to kya ye taxperes ke paise kii barabaadi nahin he?5 trillian iconomi or acchhee shikshakanhaiya kumaar ne aage kaha, jab hamaare pradhanmantri kehete hai ki ham paanch trillian keeiconomibanane ja rahe hai, to kya desh main 5 hajaar chaatro ko acchhee shiksha nahin di ja sakati? jeenyu kii jahaan tak baat he to kisi bhi chaatr ko khayraat main kuch nahin diya ja rahaa he

 JNU is the only university that produces good research in social science

 There have been many big mistakes on and off the field, but these mistakes are such that they will be refreshed like bad memories in the minds of the people, although this also includes the controversy with the wrong decision of the referees
 vishwa cap kii adhikarik gend ‘jabulani’ kaa vivaad bhi is vishwa cap ke itihaas main darj ho jaayegaa
 But if we talk about the performance inside the field except referees, Ghana, especially Asamohan Gyan, will always feel the pain that he will make his name as the South African team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time in history

 But his star striker Gian's penalty shot went out and Ghana lost 4–2 to Uruguay in a penalty shoot-out
 ek taraf jahaan argentina ke mahaan khilaadi diego maradona kaa naam 1986 vishwa cap main ‘hand aaf gad’ se judaa hua he, vahiin suarej kaa naam bhi ‘kukhyat’ varg main darj ho gaya he
 Suarez, however, had no regrets and said that now 'hand of Gad' has won my name, while this deliberate mistake will also be remembered for this World Cup
