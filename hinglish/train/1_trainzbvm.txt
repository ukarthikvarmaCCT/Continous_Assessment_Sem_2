 The Reserve Bank of India is not sending currency notes of 2000 rupees or it has stopped printing of these notes
 esbiai ne apni research report main ashanka jataai he ki arabiai bade noton kii aapurti chalan main kam kar rahaa he
 SBI on Wednesday said in its ecoflash report that till December 8, 2017, it has printed high denomination notes of Rs 15,78,700 crore
 report kii maane to inamen se 2,46,300 karod rupee ke mulya ke noton kii aapurti bazaar main nahin kii gai he
 SBI has expressed apprehension in the report that either the central bank may stop printing of high denomination notes or it may stop the supply of printed currency in circulation
 esbiai ne apniresearch report memloksabhaa main sarkaar kii taraf se pesh kiye gaye aankade or arabiai kii anual report ke aadhaar par kaha he ki march, 2017 tak choti mudra kii vailu 3,50,100 karod rupee thi
 SBI has said that if the value of small denomination notes is separated by December 8, then the value of big denomination notes was 13,32,400 crores till this date
 report main bataaya gaya he kiarbiine 8 disambar tak 500 rupee ke 1695
 7 crore notes are printed
 vahiin, usne is taarikh tak 365
 4 crore notes are 2000 rupees
 report ne vitt mantralay kii taraf se loksabhaa main pesh kiye gaye aankadon ke aadhaar par yah jaankaree di he
 The report says that its total value has been Rs 15,78,700 crore
 report kii lekhika or esbiai kii group chif iconomic adwiser saumya kanti ghosh ne kaha ki in aankadon se aisa lagata he ki he ki kendriya bank ne 2643 arab rupee mulya (15,787 arab rupye - 13,324 arab rupye) ke bade noton ko chapa to he, lekin unhen cirkulation main nahin bheja gaya he
 The report said that at present it is safe to assume that during this period, the RBI has printed small denomination notes of Rs 2,643 billion, which include 50 and 200 rupee notes
 report main kaha gaya he ki ek tarksangat parinaam ke taur par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki 2000 rupee ke noton kii vajah se lenden main kaaphi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, it may be that RBI initially printed a large amount of big notes to maintain the liquidity position
 lekin kuch vakt baad ho saktaa he ki usne bade noton kii yaa to chapai roak di ho yaa phir usne chote noton kii chapai tej kar di ho
 The report estimates that from these figures it appears that the share of small notes in circulation may have reached 35 per cent
 pichley saal modi sarkaar ne 8 november ko 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton ko chalan se baahar karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 At that time, both these notes accounted for 86–87 per cent of the total currency in circulation

 South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis believes that there is no strong contender in a big competition like the World Cup and the heavy pressure of expectation will end India's advantage in playing domestic conditions in the current tournament
 kallis ne kaha ki vishwacap main koi team virdohi ko halke main nahin le sakati or jo team mushkil lamhon main dabaav se behatar tareeke se nipategi vah yah pratishthit trophy jeetne main safal rahegi
 The 35-year-old all-rounder told reporters after his team's practice session on Ferozeshah Kotla, 'I don't think any team is starting as a strong contender right now
 kaaphi log bharat ke bare main baat kar rahe hai lekin hamen pataa he ki gharelu sarajameen par dabaav main khelnaa kitna mushkil hota he
 This will probably end their advantage of playing at home
 ’unhone kaha, ‘antat: yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki aap group charan main kaisaa khelte hai or quarter final, semifinal, final main pahunchane ke baad kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 i think all teams are in competition
 jo team dabaav main sarvshereshth khel dikhaaegi vah sheersh par rahegi
 Asked about the 'boker' tag associated with the team in the ICC tournament, Kallis said, "much has been said in the media about Boker's stamp
 lekin ham khilaadi is bare main sochate bhi nahin hai
 Kallis said that he is fully recovered from the rib injury and will play in the team's opening match against West Indies here on Thursday
 unhone kaha, ‘ab tak sab kuch yojana ke mutabik ho rahaa he
 i have been bowling for about a week
 main match ke liye puri tarah feet hum
 'he,' most of the players are in good condition and are ready to perform well
 acchhee baat yah he ki hamen sabhi 15 khilaadiyon ke bich se chunane kaa mauka milegaa

 bharat ne isisi vishwa cap-2019 ke pehle match main dakshin africa par badi jeet ke saath apane mishan kaa aagaaj kiya he
 India won the match by 6 wickets thanks to the unbeaten century of team vice-captain Rohit Sharma

 Rohit Sharma also had to change his batting style for this century
 'main of da match' rohit sharma ne jeet ke baad kaha ki unki koshish mushkil wicket par basics par bane rahane or saajhedaariyaan karne kii thi
 Rohit scored an unbeaten 122 off 144 balls with 13 fours and two sixes on a helpful pitch for the bowlers
 vishwa cap main yah rohit kaa doosraa shatak he
 Rohit said, "there was something for the bowlers in this pitch, i could not play my natural game
 mujhe apane shots khilne main samay laga, mujhe apane kuch shots bhi rokane pade
 Initially my attempt was to leave the ball, i wanted to stay on my basics and do partnerships
 "ek chor par akele rohittim ke up-captain rohit ne kaha ki team ke har ballebaaj kaa apana kaam he
 Someday someone walks and someone else walks
 rohit ke alaava koi anya ballebaaji pachaas ran bhi nahin bana sakaa
 India had lost the wickets of opener Shikhar Dhawan (8) and captain Virat Kohli (18) in the beginning
 iske baad ke el rahul bhi kuch khaas nahin kar paae or 26 ran kii pari khelkar chalate bane
 But Rohit Sharma, standing at the other end, managed to take the team to the goal after a slow start
 rohit ne is bejod pari ke baad kaha, "sabhi ballebaajon kii apni jimmedaari he
 We do not trust any one
 yahi is team kii pahchaan he
 We did the same, it is a big tournament and sometimes someone will come forward and sometimes someone will come forward
 " rohit ne england ke mausam par kaha, "ham england main garmiyon kii shuruyaat main khel rahe hai

 "apart from Rohit, MS Dhoni played a valuable knock of 34 runs in the middle order and after that Hardik Pandya, who came to bat, gave the team victory with four boundaries with 15 balls left
 hardik ne bhi 7 gendo main visphotak 15 ranon kii pari kheli
 In fact, the foundation of the victory was laid by the bowlers who after winning the toss, batting first, bundled the African team to just 227 runs

 When the NDA government led by the BJP took over in 2014, the Ministry of Defense was clearly one of its thrust areas
 party ke ghoshnaptr main is mantralay ke kaamkaaj ko durust karne ke liye kam se kam 15 vaade kiye gaye the
 These include accelerating arms procurement, promoting foreign direct investment in the defense sector and developing indigenous defense technologies, accelerating defense manufacturing and meeting the long-standing demand for an increase in defense pensions and independence
 Later battles included building a war memorial for the martyred Indian soldiers
 chaar saal baad raksha mantralay kii uplabdhiyon kaa pitara mila-jula rahaa he
 He has fulfilled many promises, such as the work of building one rank one pension and war memorial has also started
 lekin baaki maamalon main nattejey hasil karne kii gati dhimi he, jaise ki swadeshi raksha nirmaan ko badhaava dena yaa raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh aakrisht karnaa
 One of the reasons behind this is that policies were announced without fixing the structures that were to be implemented
 duusare, netritv main nirantarata kaayam nahin rah pai
 There were frequent changes at the top and the ministry saw three ministers in four years
 isse vah focus nadaarad ho gaya jisaki is khaas mantralay ko darkaar thi
 But the absence of reforms implemented in the Ministry of Defense means that many laudable goals such as self-reliance in military components (make in India) will be lost because then they will become like horse-drawn horses

 lekin abhi tak ve ek damdaar khilaadi sabit hui hai
 He has spent considerable energy in the ministry
 ve sainya abhyaason main shariq hone ke liye deshbhar ke daure karti rahi hai
 He has also made several policy changes, including a new mantra to rationalize things, which means full recovery for every money of the Defense Ministry
 unhone nai raksha nirmaan niti banaai he or raksha audyogic coridor sthapit kiya he
 a new Defense Planning Committee has been set up under NSA Ajit Doval to correct the shortfalls in the lack of a roadmap and prepare a blueprint for national security and defense planning documents

 But there have been many significant and appreciable changes in the style of functioning of the ministry

 neerav modi, mehul chokasee se jude arabon rupee ke bank lone ghotaale ke baad ab dilli naagarik sahakaari bank kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 Here loans were distributed over fake documents
 farji i-stamp, farji itiar, farji registry, farji pate ke dastavej or na jane kya kya bana kar lone kii bandarbaant hui
 The condition was that with the connivance of employees and brokers, the bank kept defrauding crores of rupees and the bank kept sitting silently
 yamuna vihaar branch, karavalnagar branch, shahdara branch, lajpat nagar branch, janakapuri branch or na jane kitni or branch main 2011 se lekar 2014 ke bich lone ke naam par dhandhalebaaji hui
 Bank members were created in a fraudulently planned conspiracy in the number of fake members, after which a loan of millions of crores was taken
 gaban, ghotaale, farji lone kii jaankaree bank, chairman,diarector or adhikariyon se lekar register of socity tak kathith taur par sabhi ko jaankaree thi, lekin sab ne chuppi saadhe rakhi
 Even after knowing so many years, the bank did not even act in the name of legal action
 desh kii rajdhani main dilli naagarik sahakaari bank ke khaaton ke is gorakhdhandhe ko ''ajtak'' kii special invastigeshan team ne apni jaanch main benakaab kiya
 First of all under investigation, it was found in Maujpur that a woman named Mona had taken a loan of Rs 4
5 lakh in 2014
 dilli naagarik sahakaari bank kii yamuna vihaar shakha ne mona ko beautic kaa kaam badhaane ke liye lone par diya
 But the empty plot was found where the boutique was known
 mona ne lone lete vakt bank main teen saal kii inakam tex ritern, pan card samet tamaam dastauez lagaae
 All those papers were fake and Mona used to work in homes
 mona ke acanut main aayaa lone kaa paisa umesh naam ke shaks ke account main chalaa gaya
 Vishal Pathak, a government employee living in Maujpur area, took a loan of three lakhs
 lekin ye lone hi uske liye ji kaa janjaal ban gaya
 If Vishal Pathak agreed, he put papers in the bank to take a loan, but till date there was no loan money in his account
 iske badale aa rahe hai to lone kii recovery ke liye kist chukaane ke notice
 Surprisingly, Vishal Pathak's money also went to the account of a person named Umesh
 chaukaaney vaali baat ye bhi he ki bank main vishaal pathak ke naam par un logon kii lone lautaane kii surity bhi le rakhi he jinhen wo jaanata tak nahin
 The special investigation team till date reached house number C-12 / 8 in Yamuna Vihar under investigation
 yahaan rahane vaale maggo danpati ko bank se kareeb 10 lakh rupee makaan ke rinovations or boutique chalaane ke liye lone ke taur par 2012-13 main die gaye the
 Surprisingly no renovation took place here, nor did any boutique open
 jab aaj tak kii team ne lone ke liye lagaae gaye kagajaat kii padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki sab farji dastavej dekar lone liya gaya
 Here too, the guarantee of loan was given by Vishal Pathak, who Vishal himself did not know
 ye paisa bhi umesh ke acount main gaya
 The team till date reached Umesh after searching
 umesh ne bataaya ki 5 lone uske acanut main transfar hue
 Umesh claimed that all this happened at the behest of the former director of the bank
 usee ke log farji kaagaz banaate the or logon ke lone karavaate the
 Shockingly, despite the bank knowing everything about this forgery, not a single complaint was lodged against the police in Umesh
 karmchaariyon kii mileebhagatye to wo aam log the jinhonen bank ke karmchaariyon ke saath milakar ghapalebaji kar farji tareeke se lone liye or us par bank ne koi thos karrwai nahin kii
 But here, Ajit Singh, the director sitting in the bank, also took a loan in a fake way and paid it off quietly
 ajit singh ne bank main lone applai kiya or kagajaat main lone lene ke liye khud ko karaval nagar ke ek praivet skool kaa karmchaaree dikhaaya
 Put a salary slip there
 jab us skool main ja kar padtaal kii gai to pataa chalaa ki ajit singh kaa apana ek skool he or wo kabhi is skool main karmchaaree nahin rahe hai
 Not only this, the registration of e-stamp by Ajit Singh was also fake
 diarector ajit singh kii tarah hi bank ke chairman ke rishtedaar bhi farjivade main peeche nahin the
 Such a registry was maintained in the bank which neither had the signature of the buyer or the seller
 jab is baat se chairman ko ru-ba-ru karaayaa gaya to pehle to wo kuch bolne se bachate rahe
 Then said that something like this is not in his knowledge
 is puure prakaran main 5 mukademe hue or wo saare bank kii lajpat nagar shakha se jude hai or amar colony thane main darj hai
 There is no investigation by the police in these till now
 jab maamle ne raajnneetik rang lenaa shuru kiya tab kahin jaakar uparajyapal ne is kii tafteesh dilli police kii iodblu ko saunpi
 In the year 2013, the RBI report made it clear that everything is not right in Delhi Citizen Bank
 report main bataaya gaya tha ki lajpat nagar kii shakha main 80 pratishat lone farji tareeke se die gaye the
 All these loans were either in the name of granting money in marriage or in the name of fixing the house
 arabiai ne aapatti jataai thi ki iske alaava lone kaa koi or makasad kyon nahin tha
 This branch was under the control of the then chairman Jayabhagwan
 isi report main 283 lakh ke lone main gadabadjhaalaa paaya gaya tha
 Later, five victims got five cases of fake loans through the court, but neither the police nor the bank took any action
 kaise khulaa maamalaartiai activist anil kumaar goud ne 2016 main kai baikon ke 717 khaaton se farji tareeke se lone dene kii shikaayat kii thi
 After that only 72 accounts were investigated and out of which 58 accounts had come to the point of taking loans through fake documents
 iske baad regitror of socity offis ne section 62 ke tahat sanjay sharma naam ke adhikari kii aguwai main jaanch bithai
 Investigation revealed that the bank had set rules on a large scale and made fake members first
 phir lone dene ke liye farji kagajaat banaae gaye jaise inakam tex ritern, pate kaa saboot aadi
 Then all the loans were closed without any investigation
 ye sab hua bank karmchaariyon kii kathith mileebhagat se hua
 On Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's statement that development cannot be done by suppressing the attitudes of tribes, Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said that it is wrong to say that the voice of tribals in the state has been suppressed
 rahul gandhi kii ore se kalahandi jile ke jagannathpur gaanv main die gaye ek bhaashan ke dauraan ukt bayaan dene ke kuch hi ghanton baad mukhyamantri ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘yah (janajatiyon kii aawaaj dabaayi gayi) saraasar galat he

 DNS Bank President Uday Karve said that we had followed the rules before printing this advertisement

 BJP seats have decreased in Gujarat
 lekin vot share 2012 ke mukaable kareeb sava fisadi badha he
 With this, BJP could cut that aggressive campaign of Congress
 jis campan ko rahul gandhi ne painaapan diya or pehali baar ye dikhaa ki bijepi gujarat main badi mushkil main he
 It was not easy for the BJP to destroy 22 years of anti-incumbency, but if Narendra Modi did it in Gujarat then it is a big victory for BJP
 kaante kii takkar aisi thi ki kai siton par jeet-haar kuch sau or kuch hazaar vot se hi tay hui
 How BJP adopted a new strategy in the face of an aggressive campaign made by the Congress
 kaise apane kor vot base main kam se kam nuksaan hone diya
 How the damage was done by making a dent in the Congress stronghold
 iskaa vishleshan zaruri he
 Even though the seats are less than last time, the core vote share of the BJP remained
 yahi vajah he jisase bijepi ne gujarat main satta kaa sixsar laga diya
 No matter how angry i was
 gujarat main bijepi kii chunavi jeet ke ye bade factor rahe
 The BJP remained in possession in urban and urban areas
 - shahari ilaakon kii 55 siton main bijepi ne 43 siten jiti
 - a stronghold like Ahmedabad, Vadodara is maintained by BJP
 - kuccha or saurashtra ko chhodkar baaki gujarat main varchasv rahaa
 - BJP has made a dent in the old tribal strongholds of Congress
 - patidaar vot khoe, lekin kaaphi had tak obisi voter jude
 - The stronghold of the movement against GST was also successful in Surat
 bijepi kii sabase badi chunauti gujarat ke us jatigat sameekaran ko todna tha, jise congress ne apni smart chunavi ranneeti ke tahat chunaavon se kareeb ek maheene pehle hi banaaya tha
 The trio of Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani were special
 bijepi ke khilaaf jati sameekaran saadhane main congress kaaphi had tak kaamyaab rahi, kyonki patidaaron ke vot main congress ne send lagaai
 Congress also benefited from Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani
 bhale hi utana phayda nahin hua ki wo bijepi ko peeche chhod pate
 But in reality, the BJP retained the stronghold of Gujarat by making inroads into the Congress stronghold and occupying urban areas
 gujarat membijapi or congress ke bichsiton kaa faasla 20 se bhi kam rahaa
 This tells the exciting election match of Gujarat that there was such a tough contest in each seat that till the last time the candidates kept going back and forth
 gujarat main 17 siten aisi raheen, jahaan haar jeet kaa antar 2000 vot se bhi kam rahaa he
 The BJP won 8 seats by a margin of less than 2000 votes and the Congress won 9
 gujarat main 8 siten aisi raheen, jahaan haar jeet kaa antar 1000 vot se bhi kam rahaa he
 The BJP has won 2 seats and the Congress 6 seats by less than 1000 votes
 adivasee bahul kaparada seat par congress sirf 170 vot se jiti
 BJP won Godhra seat by just 258 votes
 mansa seat ko congress ne bijepi se sirf 524 vot se jeeta
 This thorn contest is the election story of Gujarat, whose victory enthusiasm was seen today in the face and speech of the Prime Minister himself
 isliye wo aaj baar baar gujarat main bijepi kii teen dashak se lagaataar jeet kii baat yaad dilaa rahe the
 Mohammad Azam Khan, Uttar Pradesh's strongman minister and senior Samajwadi Party leader, has invited Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, who was a victim of American misconduct, to contest from Rampur in the Lok Sabha
 ajam ne kaha ki devayani is jillat bhari naukari ko chhodir rampur se chunaav laden or sansad main pahunchakar america kaa purajor virodh karen
 It is worth noting that a few months ago, Azam Khan too has become a victim of similar misconduct in America
 ve us samay america main kumbh meley kii safalataa par vyaakhyaan dene gaye the
 Azam strongly condemned the harsh behavior of the Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, who was posted in the US, for the dirty behavior done by the US administration beyond the limits, and expressed great regret that parties such as the BJP, the Alambardar of Indian culture and Hindutva happened to Devyani No one reacted specifically to how the US tolerated Suluk
 yahaan tak ki viechpi jaisaa sanghathan bilkul khamosh rahaa
 He said that this silence of these people is a surprise
 aazam khan ne kaha ki america ek aisa desh he jo varshon se khaaskar hindustaniyon ke saath amaryadit vyavhaar karata aa rahaa he, yahaan tak ki usne is desh ke ati sammanit vyaktiyon ko bhi nahin baksha he
 On reaching America, Khud was also treated with similar disdain, against whom he immediately protested and expressed his strong indignation at this shameful and insulting behavior, when many Indians who were victims of this abuse , He exposed it years later
 philvakt rampur se jaya pradaa saansad hai
 In 2009, she won the election on the SP ticket and Azam Khan was not in the party at that time
 baad main jaya or unke raajnneetik guru amar singh sapa chhod chale gaye or ajam waapas party main aa gaye

 He said that the BJP-RSS has abused me so far, i have benefited immensely

 Rahul said that no matter how much you hate me, i will only talk to you with love
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki narendra modi mere role model nahin lekin unamem bahut si baaten hai jo acchhee lagati hai
 They are my opponents, that does not mean that i will not praise them

 com / im1tdsyof2— Congress (@incindia)january 24, 2019purvottar kyon jaruri?2019 ke chunavi ran ke hisaab se purvottar kaa hissaa bhartiya janata party or congress donon ke liye ahm hone ja rahaa he
 On the one hand, the BJP has focused its attention on those seats where it could not win the elections in 2014 and if there is a deficit in North India in this election, then it can recover from here
 vahiin abhi tak kai chunavi sarvon main ye bhi saaf he hua he ki congress uttar bharat main bhartiya janata party ko sidhe taur par takkar nahin de paa rahi he
 Therefore, the focus of Congress is also in areas where it is strong
 aapako bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi pichley do dinon se apane sansadeey kshetra amethi main the, jahaan se unhone centre kii narendra modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul Gandhi claimed that in 2019, the Congress will form the government at the Center, besides he accused Narendra Modi of making a mess in the Rafale deal
 bataa den ki shivasena kii maang thi ki dhai saal shivasena (shiv Sena) kaa mukhyamantri hoga or dhai saal bijepi kaa mukhyamantri banegaa
 The BJP had flatly rejected Shiv Sena's demand that no such agreement was discussed with the allies
 iske baad centre saraakar main shaamil shivasena kaa ekmaatr mantri arvind saavant ne istipha de diya tha
 However, there was no formal announcement of Shiv Sena's separation from the NDA
 bataa den ki maharashtra kii 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas 105, shivasena ke paas 56 siten hai, jabaki rakanpa or congress ke paas kramash: 54 or 44 siten hai
 Any party or coalition willing to form a government in the state will need the support of at least 145 mlas to prove a majority in the Assembly
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne ravivaar ko deepawali ke dauraan paryaapt bijli aapurti kiye jane kaa nirdesh diya
 He also instructed the administration to keep a close watch on anti-social elements that disturb social harmony so that the environment does not deteriorate
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki deepawali ke maukey par kanoon evam vyavastha puri tarah se durust rahe, iske liye jaruri he ki suraksha vyavastha chaak-chauband ho
 Firecrackers should be sold in crowded outskirts
 akhilesh ne kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye adhikariyon ko samaaj ke prabud evam varisht logon se baraabar sampark saadhe rakhane ke nirdesh bhi die
 Akhilesh said that adequate supply of electricity will be made on the occasion of Deepawali and the transport system will also be kept well
 pataakhon se paryaavaran ko hone vaale nuksaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhone logon se apil kii ki ve pataakhe jalaate samay saavdhaanee baraten, kyonki is tyohaar par aksar durghatnaayen ho jaati hai
 Instructing to carry out a massive campaign against adulteration, he said that such people should be dealt with strictly, as no one will be allowed to play with the public health
 uttar pradesh bijli nigam ko deepawali ke maukey par vishesh rup se taiyaari karne kaa nirdesh dete hue unhone kaha ki is dauraan yathasambhav adhik se adhik bijli kii aapurti kii jaae taaki log ullaspurvak tyohaar manaa saken
 Last night, 8 soldiers including three inspectors of the Excise Department were badly injured in the bloodshed in a village in Meerut

 One person also died in this incident
 ghatana ke baad jila prashasan ne maamle kii magistrate jaanch karaane ke aadesh die hai
 In Mirzapur village of Meerut, a team of policemen went to shut down the illegal liquor furnace, which was injured by the people there
 exise adhikari ke mutabik jaise hi sharaab kii bhattiyon par chhapemari hui, sharaab taiyaar kar rahe log bhaag nikle or nadi paar kar isaki soochna mobile par gaanvvaalon ko de di
 Then hundreds of people surrounded the excise and police team's car and took them hostage

 But where the villagers were going to stay, they also ran and beat the officers and policemen of the Excise Department and injured them badly

 ab is par yashavanth sinha ne kaha he ki 'agar main naukari kaa aavedak hota, to shaayad wo (arun jetali) pehle number par naa hote'
 Yashwant Sinha said that Arun Jaitley has forgotten my background

 It has not taken me 25 years to choose my Lok Sabha seat
 yashavanth bole ki jinhone loksabhaa kii shakl nahin dekhi, wo mere upar aarope laga rahe hai
 i have not attacked anyone personally
 yashavanth sinha bole ki maine veepi singh kii sarkaar main mantri pad thukraa diya tha, lekin arun jetali ne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main rajyamantri kaa pad sweekaar kar liya
 He did not even reach the Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha ki kaledhan par vittamantri par desh ko gumraah kar rahe hai, kaledhan or panama par jetali gumraah kar rahe hai
 He told that i and Chidambaram have never been friends, but Arun Jaitley and Chidambaram have been friends
 panama maamle main bharat main karrwai kyon nahin ho rahi he
 We will not allow the issue to go astray, hence personal accusations
 jo loksabhaa kaa sadsy he vahi logon kii baat samaj saktaa he, paanv main chhaale padenge to hi kuch samaj aayega
 Jaitley had reversed that at an event on Thursday, Arun Jaitley had said that foreign investment in the country is continuously increasing and it is the highest ever
 bataa duun ki jentalman jab vittamantri the to hamaare paas sirf chaar dinon kaa videshi mudra bhandar tha
 Which is now 4 billion dollars
 'arthvyavastha kii sehat' par yashavanth ko jetali kaa jawaab, rakhe ye 10 tathy, yaad dilaayaa 2002chidambaram ko bhi gherishvanth sinha or congress netaa chidambaram par hamalaa bolte hue jetali ne kaha ki log jiesti or notebandi kii aalochana kar rahe hai ki ise jaldbaaji main lagu kiya gaya
 Once upon a time we had such situations that there was corruption due to the decisions of the government, policy paralysis would have taken place
 ab log faislon kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 Before Yashwant did the biggest war, Sinha, who had created a political storm by attacking Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the current state of the economy, said that he had sought an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year to discuss the condition of the economy
 But they did not get time
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha, 'maine paaya ki mere liye daravaaje band the
 Therefore, i had no choice but to speak in the media
 mujhe vishwaas he ki mere paas pradhanmantri ko dene ke liye upyukt suzav hai
 Sinha said that people like former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or former Union Finance Minister p Chidambaram, who are considered experts on financial matters, should be heard by the government of that time if they speak
 unhone un logon kii raay ko ‘rajnatik shabdadambar’ ke taur par khaarij kiye jane ke khilaaf salaah di
 Have you heard or heard anything between you? Are they angry with you? Are you not tolerating their resentment? If you feel so offended by them, then convince them without delay
 kai baar aisa hota he ki ham anjaane main kuch aisa kar jate hai jisase saamne vaale ko bura lag jaataa he
 Even if our attention is not to hurt, but the heart of the person in front is unhappy
 
 
 agar aapako is baat kaa ehsaas he to bina vakt barbaad kiye saamne vaale ko manaa len
 Apologize for your mistake inadvertently
 apane saathi ko ye samajhane kii koshish karen ki aapaki aisi koi intension nahin thi
 Despite this, if his anger does not cool down then say sorry to him and promise that you will avoid doing any such thing in future
 sori bolne ke baad bhi agar wo us baat ko bhul nahin paa rahe hon to maafee maangane ke liye ye upaay apanaaen
 By adopting these measures, they will be happy in a moment
 1
 If their displeasure still remains, then make their favorite dishes
 koshish karen ki ye vyanjan ye aap hi banaaen, helper nahin
 If they eat food and praise you, it means that they have forgiven you
 2
 If you think that the battle started because of you and you only made it big, then apologize
 kuch aisa kiijie jisase wo hans den
 3
 unhen manaane ke liye aap chahen to ek choti si kavita bhi likh sakati hai
 If you cannot write a poem, write a short note
 jisamen pyaar ke saath sori bhi likhaa ho
 4

 lagaataar mausam kii maar jhel rahe maharashtra ke kisaan bure haal main hai
 If we look at the figures, then on an average, a farmer is committing suicide in the areas of Vidarbha and Marathwada
 pichley teen-chaar saalon se kabhi ativrishti to kabhi sookhaa padane se fasalein chaupat hoti rahi hai
 In such a situation, the atmosphere of despair is more
 itnaa ki ab dil dahalane vaali khabar ai he ki ek bujurg kisaan ne apane hi khet main khud kii chita jalaakar jindagi samaapt kar di
 This tragic incident is from a village in Akola district of western Vidarbha, where 76-year-old frustrated farmer Kashiram had to take this step
 jis bujurg se sab salaah lete the, usee ke is kadam se puraa gaanv sann rah gaya
 Kanshi Ram was disappointed with the crop collapse
 ek acre khet main unhen kam se kam das quintal soyabean kii ummid thi, lekin haath ai dedh quintal
 Then there were caterpillars in Tuar, and the courage was broken
 khaas baat yah he ki is bujurg par kisi bank kaa koi karj nahin tha, lekin fasalein baar−baar chaupat hoti raheen
 This time there was such a drought that it seemed difficult to survive till the next monsoon
 aisa sirf kanshiram ke saath hi nahin hua
 According to the data, an average farmer is committing suicide in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra every day
 vidarbha ke 11 main se sabase adhik peedit chah jilon main pichley 50 dinon main 42 kisaan jaan de chuke hai
 This is the same area where more than 10,000 farmers have committed suicide in 13 years
 kisaanon kii khudakushi kaa yah mudda samay−samay par uthta rahaa he, lekin rajya sarkarein aise maamalon ko bhi siyaasi ladaai main ghaseetati rahi hai
 Now the new state government has sought help from the central government to provide relief to such farmers
 bihar upachunaav main mili jeet ke baad pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne bhartiya janata party par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 He said that a government of social justice will be formed in the entire country including Bihar
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah 'india shining' duba tha, usee tarah 'har har modi ghar ghar modi' bhi hawa main ud jayega
 Rabri Devi termed the by-election victory as a victory for social justice
 rabari ne nitish kumaar or centre sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki jab nitish kumaar ne pehle ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah apana candidet khadaa nahin karenge to phir vah kaise palat gaye
 He said that Nitish Kumar is deeply shocked and he should learn from it
 vahiin, rabari ne upi chunaav main bijepi kii haar par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki jis tarah atal bihari vaajapei kaa india shining kaa naaraa duba tha, usee tarah bahut jald har-har modi ghar-ghar modi kaa naaraa bhi hawa main ud jayega
 He said that all the leaders of the opposition are coming together and this solidarity will lead to the formation of a government of social justice not only in Bihar but in the whole country
 bataa den ki bihar main do vidhansabha or ek loksabhaa siton par hue chunaav main se bijepi ko ek hi seat (vidhansabha, bhabhua) par jeet mil saki
 In June this year, when global crude oil prices crossed $ 80 per barrel, fuel prices increased significantly, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that the central government cannot do anything special in this matter and states should get fuel But VAT should be reduced
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki daam kam karne hai to petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laana hoga
 Three months after this, oil prices are boiling across the country, Congress organized a nationwide bandh on 10 September to protest against this
 mumbai main petrol kii keemat kareeb 88
 Rs 21 per liter and price of diesel 77
 41 rupye prati litre ko paar kar chuki he
 There was sporadic violence in many states during the bandh, but it still seems that the central government has little to do in terms of reducing fuel prices
 or sarkaar tabhi kuch kar sakati he, jab uskaa aisa koi iraadaa ho
 The reason for this is not difficult to know
 paramparaagat rup se utpaada shulk or waite centre or rajya sarkaron ke liye rajasav ke bade strot rahe hai
 2 from the tax on petroleum and petroleum products by the central government in the year 2017-18
 84 lakh karod ru
 , While in the meantime the states received 2 from the tax on fuel
 09 lakh karod rupye kii aamadani hui
 Taxes on petroleum account for 36 per cent of the central and 20 per cent of the states' tax revenue
 centre sarkaar petrol par prati litre 20 rupye or dijal par 15
 Charges a lump sum excise duty of 25 rupees
 rajyon ke waite or bikri kar alag-alag hote hai
 Like 16 per cent on petrol in Goa and 38 in Maharashtra
 5 se 39
 Is up to 5 percent
 dijal ke maamle main maharashtra main yah 22 se 25 fisadi to chandigarh main 11
 Is up to 5 percent
 jab tak centre or rajya sarkarein is moti kamai main katautee kii kuwvat nahin dikhaaengi, inaki keemten oonchi bani rahengi
 Even before the Bharat Bandh, the Rajasthan government announced a 4% reduction in VAT on fuel, due to which the fuel prices in the state were 2
 50 rupye prati litre tak kii kami aa gai
 Later, the Andhra Pradesh government also announced a reduction in the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per liter
 pashchim bengal ne bhi eendhan kii keemton main 1 rupye prati litre tak kii katautee karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 High fuel prices can boost inflation in the country
 care retings ke mukhya arthshaastri madan sabanvis bataate hai, "thok mulya suchakank main petrol or dijal kaa sanyukt vettege kareeb 4
 7 percent
 '' yah acchhee khabar nahin he
 The high inflation may force the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates in the next monetary policy
 isse udyogon or makaanon aadi ke liye lone mahangaa ho jayega
 The situation has worsened with the rupee falling to record lows
 chaalu khate ke ghate (siedi) ke badhate jane se 10 sitambar ko dollar ke mukaable rupaya ek nae nichle str ke record 72
 Reached 67
 jab desh kaa aayaat mulya uske niryaat mulya se zyada hota he to use chaalu khate kaa ghaataa kaha jaataa he
 It has increased continuously in the last four quarters due to high crude oil prices

 So far, the deficit of finance which India has maintained, it can spoil it
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he or rupye main giravat vaishvik karkon kii vajah se ho rahi he
 Sajid Chaudhary, JP Morgan's Mukti Economist in India, believes that the rupee is going through a healthy decline, which will boost the competitiveness of the Indian economy
 lekin kamjor rupye or america-china ke bich trade waar kii chintaaon kii vajah se 10 sitambar ko bisai sensex main 467 ankon kii or 11 sitambar ko 509 ankon kii giravat ai
 At present, no solution can be found for this
 jab tak centre or rajya sarkarein eendhan se milane vaale rajasav main katautee nahin karengi, keemten kam nahin hongi
 *** desh ke pradhanmantri kii saans khatre main he
 Do not be surprised this is a reality vaise to pradooshan ne puri dilli ko apni giraft main le rakhaa he lekin ye ummid kii ja rahi thi ki kam se kam pradhanmantri nivas ke aasapaas kaa ilaaka us bade khatre se achoota rahegaa
 But you will be surprised that the danger is equally great in the area of 7, Race Course
 lutiuns jone kii bhi hawa jahrilisehrili hawadilli kaa dam nikaal rahi he
 There is hardly a corner of the country's capital where your lungs can get clean air
 isse koi matlab nahin ki koun kitne ucch pad par he yaa koun dilli ke hai profile lutiuns jone main rahata he
 When we checked the level of pollution from PM Tracker, the meter measuring pollution outside the Prime Minister's house, the surprising figures came out
 pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradooshan kaa str 14 guna zyadamshin ke aankadon ke mutabik subah ke kareeb saadhe nau baje pradhanmantri ke ghar ke baahar particulet matter yani PM 2
 The quantity of 5 was above 2000 micrograms per cubic meter, while in Delhi only 60 micrograms per cubic meter is considered absolutely clean
 agar hawa main particulet matter 2
 Even if the quantity of 5 is from 60 to 150 micrograms per cubic meter, there is not much danger
 lekin centre for science and envaranment (CSE) kii mashin ne pradhanmantri ke ghar ke baahar pradooshan kaa str kareeb 14 guna zyada darj kiya
 Air Quality Index If the level of polluted particles present in the air is from zero to fifty, then air is considered better and there is no loss
 agar air quality index 51 se 100 he to bhi hawa thik maani jaati he lekin thodi nuksaandeh ho sakati he
 If the air quality index ranges from 101 to 150, it becomes worrisome and more harmful
 air quality index jab 151 se 200 tak pahunchataa he to ise sehat ke liye khatarnaak mana jaataa he
 As soon as the air quality reaches 201 to 300, it becomes very dangerous in terms of respiratory diseases and lung cancer particles start to get active in the air beyond the 300
 dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main PM 2
 Quantity of 5 ITO: 2,4907, Race Course: 1,800-2,000 Anand Vihar: 1,900-2,000 Mayur Vihar: 3,000 Chanakyapuri: 2,200-2,400 Chandni Chowk: 2,500-3,00010, Janpath: 750- 800 of clear air in rest of the world
 In Delhi, only 60 micrograms per cubic meter is considered clean air, but PM 2 in most countries of the world
 5 kii seemaa or bhi kam he
 Know how many micrograms per cubic meter is considered absolutely clean air in some big countries of the world

 atakalon kii maani jaye to ali ke pita nahin chaahate the ki sara kaa dogi unki fimali kaa member bane
 There is no fault of this couple in this matter
 aakhir donon aisi peedi ke hai jo jaldi alag hone main jaraa bhi nahin jhijakte
 Now both are living a happy divorced life
 lekin aakhir kya vajahe hai kii shaadi ke baad couples itani jaldi ek duusare se alag hone kaa faisla le lete hai
 According to the counselor, the reasons for divorce begin with small matters
 aisi baaten jin par aap vishwaas nahin karenge
 Relationship expert Kamal Khurana says that some of the special reasons for the early divorce in today's generation include these small things - like how you treated my friends, you treat my mother badly, i Can't live with you ranjit or tanya kii shaadi ko abhi chah maheene hi beete the
 Soon both decided to divorce
 donon ke talaak kii vajah thi ki ranjit bed par hameshaa geela tauliya chhod jaataa tha
 Both are working and Tanya did not tolerate Ranjit's habit at all
 yahi vajah thi kii donon ne alag hone kaa faisla kiya
 Counselor Anu Goyal says that the divorce center became a wet towel in this whole story
 aksar couples main aisi baton kii vajah se ladaai hoti he or aksar har ladaai main unhen baar-baar ghasita jaataa he or inhi choti choti ladaiyon kii vajah se donon me talaak kii naubat aa gai
 There is no election for the family of RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav from Saran Lok Sabha seat in Bihar
 is baar is seat se lalu prasad yadav ke samadhi chandrika raay argedy ke tikat se taal thok rahe hai
 He has been a 6-time MLA from Parsa assembly seat in Saran and has been a minister in the Grand Alliance government in Bihar
 isse pehle bhi wo bihar sarkaar main mantri rah chuke hai
 Chandrika Rai, once separated from the RJD, won the election as an independent
 haalanki loksabhaa ke ummidavaar pehali baar bane hai
 His father Daroga Rai has been the Chief Minister of Bihar
 lalu prasad yadav se pehle daroga raay samaajik nyaay ke sabase bade netaa maane jate the
 Chandrika Rai has been nominated by the RJD as its candidate for the Saran Lok Sabha seat on behalf of the Grand Alliance
 chandrika raay lalu prasad yadav ke samadhi or tejpratap yadav ke sasur hai
 Recently, Tej Pratap Yadav had said that if Chandrika Rai got RJD ticket, he (tej Pratap Yadav) would campaign against her
 haalanki saaran main matdaan ke liye ab kuch din hi baaki bache hai, lekin ab tak tejpratap yadav ne apane sasur ke khilaaf prachaar nahin kiya
 In this case, Chandrika Rai says that the statement made by Tejapratap was given on April 1
 lihaaja sabhi samaj sakate hai ki vah din koun sa din tha
 He made people April Fools
 raay ne kaha ki ummid par duniya chalati he
 There is always hope ummid to he ki unki beti aishwarya or tejpratap yadav ke sambandh sudharenge
 Let me tell you that in May last year, Chandrika Rai married her daughter Aishwarya to Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav with great pomp
 haalanki shaadi ke kuch maheene baad maamla court main pahunch gaya or tejpratap ne kai sansanikhej aarope lagaae
 He also alleged that Aishwarya wanted a Lok Sabha ticket for her father Chandrika Rai, due to which the relationship deteriorated
 in sabake baavjood lalu prasad yadav ne apane samadhi ko tikat diya, tab tejpratap yadav ye kehete paae gaye ki wo unke khilaaf prachaar karenge, lekin aisa kuch abtak nahin hua
 On Wednesday, Tejashtrap Yadav's younger brother Tejashwi Yadav sought votes for Chandrika Rai in Parsa
 is dauraan tejasvi yadav lalu prasad yadav ke andaaj main najar aae
 Parsa area is a Yadav dominated area, so the crowd was also tremendous
 chandrika raay ne kaha ki chunaav main pariwarik vivaad kaa koi asar nahin he
 He said, 'you can see that the people have not made any difference
 paariwarik vivaad hote rahete hai
 Such disputes can also occur in one's family
 iskaa asar janata par nahin padataa he
 The public always decides on ideology on issues
 iske baad apana vot detii he or sarkaar chunati he
 During this time, Chandrika Rai also said, 'I certainly hope that the matter of Tejratap will be resolved soon
 tej pratap ne jo bayaan diya tha, wo ek april ko diya tha
 That day was First April i

 Amid opposition accusations of differences within the government over the scams, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said in support of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that she was an example of mildness, honesty and honesty

 He is a symbol of honesty, honesty and gentleness
 bhaajapa kaa un par vyaktigat prahaar nindaneey he
 Addressing around 1500 delegates at the 83rd Congress Congress, he said, "on behalf of all of you, i would like them to do their wise leadership and to maintain restraint even in the midst of big storms and surrender to the work of prosperity and progress of the country
" Congratulations party puri tarah se unke saath khadi he
 Senior party leaders and activists, including ministers of the central government and chief ministers of several states, are participating in the plenary
 jaipur sahitya utsav main shaamil hone ke liye lekhak salmaan rushdi ab nahin aa rahe hai
 They have been forced to take this step
 jis tarah se rajasthan sarkaar ne unki shirkat ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ko badhaava dene kaa kaam kiya vah dukhad he
 Salman Rushdie has said, "for the last several days, i have not commented publicly on the Jaipur Literature Festival at the request of the local administration of Rajasthan
" main ummid kar rahaa tha ki ve aise ehtiyaati kadam uthaa sakenge, jisase meraa vahaan aana sambhav ho sakegaa or main aise maahaul main utsav main maujuud logon ko sambodhit kar sakuunga jo sabhi ke liye surakshit or sahaj hoga
 He said that he came to know from Maharashtra and Rajasthan intelligence sources that people from Mumbai underworld have been given the contract to kill me and they left for Jaipur
 ve kehete hai, ''haalanki mujhe is khufia soochna kii satyata par puraa bharosa nahin he
 But if i come to the festival under these circumstances then it would be irresponsible to my family, the audience of the festival and my fellow writers
 isliye main ab jaipur nahin aa paaungaa
 "the manner in which the government's attitude towards fundamentalists has been raised, it also poses a danger of changing the venue of this literary festival in the future
" mana jaataa he ki is tarah ke mudde keval rajnatik hit saadhane ke liye uthaae jate hai
 In the same festival last year, the award for Best Writer was given by a Muslim writer M
K
 nakvi ko diya gaya tha
 Despite the organizers' clear intentions, anti-rushdie is not ready to listen
 yahi nahin, buland hausalon vaale muslim ekta manch ne guuruuvaar ko rushdi ke aane par utsav main baadha daalane kii dhamkee di thi
 The organization also targeted the festival in 2010 for inviting Somalia writer Ayan Hirsi Ali
 asal main uttar pradesh ke chunaavon ko dekhte hue, gahalot musalamaanon ko khush karnaa chaahate hai
 This community is very angry with Gehlot and the Congress after the police firing in Gopalgarh last September and the killing of 10 Meo Muslims in it
 aise main rushdi kii yatra ko siyaasi masalaa bananaa gahalot ke liye mufeed baithta he
 Realizing the dubious role of the state government, the Rajasthan unit, usually considered as pro-gehlot supporters of the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), is also organizing demonstrations against the attacks on Rushdie
 ek kade bayaan main usne kaha ki ''rushdi ke khilaaf pradarshnon par rajasthan sarkaar ke rukh ne gambhir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Seeing the opposition going against him, Gehlot accused the BJP that he blamed Rushdie's visit
 yah unka andaaj he ki vah danaadan bayaanbaji karte hai, or jab ulataa asar hone lagata he, to bhaajapa par aarope lagaana shuru kar dete hai
 Although the organizers and officials were trying to stop the noise about Rushdie's visit, it could not happen
 vaise aayojak is baat se bhi chintit the ki rushdi par jarurat se zyada dhyaan die jane se 258 anya lekhakon se dhyaan hatataa he
 Perhaps this concern of the organizers has now gone away
 mohammad aamir ne bhale hi unhen pareshaan kiya ho
 But Indian opener Rohit Sharma expressed displeasure over the hype created by the Pakistani fast bowler and said that instead of focusing on Jasprit Bumrah
 aamir kii baat chhodobaayen haath ke tej gendbaaj aamir ne bharat ke khilaaf asia cap main shandaar gendbaaji kii or 18 ran dekar rohit sahit teen ballebaajon ko pavilion bheja
 Rohit said, 'leave it
 usne abhi (pratibandh ke baad) vaapasi kii he
 i don't think we should be too excited about that
 abhi use ek saal or khilne do or tab ham dekhenge ki kya vah is kaabil he
 'prove himself every time, he said,' He is a good bowler but he has to prove himself every time
 keval ek match ke baad use itani adhik tavajjo dena acha nahin he
 Let him do it continuously
 ’ is 23 varshiya gendbaaj kii pakistani lijend wasim akram se tulana kii ja rahi he or rohit ne kaha ki yah kuch zyada he
 He is a common bowler, he said, 'people are comparing him to Wasim Akram
 use kuch to hasil karne do
 He is talented but there is nothing that he blows everyone away
 vah ek aam gendbaaj he jisane us din acha pradarshan kiya
 'rohit was asked that he was against Aamir's return after the ban,' this is not my concern
 yah unki raajnneeti, unka maamla he
 i am not interested in this
 mujhe is par kuch nahin kahana
 Praise Bumrah, not Aamir, Rohit praised the young fast bowler Bumrah and urged the media to praise this Indian instead of Aamir
 unhone kaha, ‘aamir ke bare main baat karne ke bajaay aapako bumraah ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 He is our Indian bowler and is doing well
 vah durlabh pratibha he
 He is young and still has a long way to go
 jis tarah se usne shuruyaat kii vah kuch khaas karegaa
 'bumrahrohit is the best bowler, because of his sling action, it is not easy for Bumrah to play on the nets
 jab vah mumbai indians se judaa to unhen vah lasith malinga jaisaa laga
 He said, 'he (bumrah) is an exception
 uskaa aana hairaani bharaa rahaa
 Even the captain did not know
 usne apane astr sambhaal kar rakhe hue the
 We saw in the Asia Cup and Australia, he bowled excellently
 uske paas achche yorker, bounsar or vah sab kuch he jo aaj ke gendbaajon kii jarurat he
 Only time will tell where it will go
 ’ Calling the promoters of extremist ideologies and left-wing extremists to leave the path of violence and join them in national efforts for promotion and development, President Pratibha Patil said on Saturday that only through dialogue can the solution of the issues be found
 raashtrapati ne 64wein swatantraaa diwas kii purv sandhya par raashtra ke naam apane sandesh main kaha ki ugr vichaardhaaraon ke pravartakon or vampanthi ugravad ke himytiyon ko hinsa kaa rasta chhod dena chahie
 i call upon them to be involved in national efforts for progress and development
 mujhe ummid he ki civil samaaj ke sabhi sadsy or sabhi vyakti aage aakar unako is disha main aage badhane main sahyog denge
 Describing the need to be the medium of dialogue, the President said that by listening to each other and respecting each other's views and understanding each other, we can find solutions to the issues before us
 raashtrapati ne aatankwaad ko vishwa shanti, sthirataa or suraksha ke liye sabase badha khatra bataate hue kaha ki aatankwaad ko parajeet karne ke liye vishwa ke sabhi deshon ko ekajute hokar kaam karnaa hoga taaki unhen kahin koi aashray, prashikshan kii jagah, vittiya saadhan or dhanchaagat sahaayta na na mili or unki vichaardhaara kii koi himaayat karne vaala na ho
 He said that we believe that peace is necessary if prosperity is to be attained
 aatankwaad vishwa kii shanti, sthirataa or suraksha ke liye sabase badha khatra he
 To overcome this, all the countries of the world will have to work unitedly so that they do not get any shelter, place of training, financial means and infrastructural support and there is no one to support their ideology
 vishwa main hinsa or nafrat kaa koi sthaan nahin ho saktaa
 Talking about not tolerating corruption at all, President Pratibha Patil said that by adopting high standards of public service, the effectiveness of governance systems will definitely be sustained and development and growth will be manifold
 unhone kaha ki nitiyaan taiyaar karne or kaary kshetra main jaakar amal main laane ke liye sarkaar main karyrat logon ko shaktiyaan di gayi hai
 It should always be remembered that this power should be used responsibly
 raashtrapati ne ucchtar shiksha main vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaane ke liye madhyamik shiksha bhi sabhi ko uplabdh karaane par jor diya or kaha ki shiksha ke dwaara shashaktikaran jaruri he kyonki isse avasaron ke bahut se daravaaje khul jate hai
 He said that it is necessary that secondary education should also be available to everyone as our effort is to increase the number of students in higher education
 isse desh ko bauddhik shakti praapt hogi
 He emphasized the need to make efforts by encouraging research and development in all areas of the country to stay ahead in advanced technologies
 saamaajik jaagrukta main giravat aane or kuch saamaajik buraaiyon ke jari rahane par chintaa jataate hue raashtrapati ne kaha ki hamen ise badalanaa hoga
 He said that we should follow the law and also work for moral upliftment
 bhautikwaad ke badhane se ek duusare ke prati samvedanheenata bhi batch rahi he
 Today is again the best opportunity to achieve new successes with the new consciousness of moral and ethical ethics
 bhautik dhanchaagat suvidhaon ke nirmaan main bhi teji laane par jor dete hue raashtrapati ne kaha ki hamen nai sadake, bandargah, hawaii adde, bijli pariyojnaon kii jarurat he or hamen maujuuda suvidhaon main sudhaar bhi karnaa hoga
 This increase will remove such structural deficiencies that hamper overall economic progress and in many ways does not match our image of the emerging world power
 unhone kaha ki hamaare udyogon ko pragati karte rahanaa chahie or bhartiya companiyon ko kushal or vaishvik rup se pratispaddhi banane ke prayaas jari rakhane chahie
 He said that in order to move towards the second green revolution, the agriculture sector needs completely different thinking with new directions and fresh ideas so that agriculture can increase yields, productivity and profits
 yah khaadya suraksha or keemton main sthirataa ke liye bahut aavashyak he
 Stating that there is a need to connect agriculture with other sectors of the economy, he said that connecting industries with agriculture will provide the basis for industrial development in rural areas and promote agricultural trade
 swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par apane deshavaasiyon kii shanti, samruddhi or pragati kii kaamana karte hue raashtrapati ne sabhi nagarikon se raashtra ke bhavishya ko sudruth or ujjwal banane main yogadan dene kaa aahvaan kiya

 Baba Ramdev said that Sitaram Yechury should take his name as Ravana

 puri duniya main isaiyon ke vistaar ke liye 30 karod se zyada logon kii hatyaein kii he
 The Mughals have killed over 100 million people to expand their empire
 hindu sahishnu hota he isliye hamen koi bhi kuch kah detaa he
 Question- Did Hindus not commit murders to get the throne? Answer - Violence within a person is his natural nature
 sabhi samaaj main hinsak log hote hai
 The Election Commission should cancel the nomination of Sitaram Yechury
 inhen jail kii salaakhon ke peeche hona chahie
 There is no religion of terror, of any violence

 i said if you really believe the Ramayana, Mahabharata as fictitious, then why have you named it? But why do these communists get annoyed as soon as the name of sita-ram comes? Question- Your entry is being done after the election of four phases , Why? Answer - i have not come for any political campaign

 sawaal-kaale dhan kii ladaai khatm ho gai?jawaab-kalaadhan, bhrashtachar, swadeshi tak sab jagah jo gulaami he, main in sabake khilaaf hum
 i had the same thoughts earlier, even today i have the same thoughts
 koi desh ko todane kii baat karegaa to main use bardaasht nahin karuunga

 The leadership of Modi ji is like Himalaya

 Significantly, on Friday, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said that the Ramayana and Mahabharata were also full of fighting and violence, but as a pracharak you only tell him as an epic, even then claim that Hindus are not violent is
 is bayaan ke baad siyasat garma gai he
 BJP leader Giriraj Singh also expressed displeasure over the statement, saying that the country's misfortune is that the one who abuses Hindus is more secular

 Voting for the Karnataka assembly elections is going on
 congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, JDS is struggling for the role of Kingmaker
 bijepi bies yediurppa ke chehre ke sahare karnataka main camel khilaane kii aas lagaae hue he
 Along with Yeddyurappa, the stronghold of the BJP and the Sangh is considered to be a stronghold of coastal Karnataka (coastal region)
 karnataka main bijepi or aresas kii hindutv kii prayogshaala isi costal belt main he
 The BJP had to bear the brunt of Yeddyurappa's rebellion in the last election in coastal Karnataka
 vahiin congress ko isi kaa phayda mila tha
 Now that Yeddyurappa is again the ruler of the BJP and the party is busy in the political politics of Hindutva
 aise main tateey karnataka kshetra main chunavi muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 Mangaluru, Udupi and Karwar Chikmagalur districts have about 20 assembly seats under the coastal Karnataka region
 centre sarkaar main mantri or karnataka bijepi ke firebrands netaa anant kumaar hegade karwaar jile se aate hai
 Five-time MP Hegde is identified as the face of Hindutva in the state
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko yediurppa kaa alag hokar chunaav ladanaa mahangaa padaa tha
 The party suffered heavily
 congress ko pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke is majboot durg se 13 siten mili thi
 Whereas BJP had got only 3 seats
 vot share ke maamle main congress ko 43 fisadi vot mili the
 While BJP got 34 percent, JDS got 9 and others got 13 percent
 vidhansabha chunaav ke ek saal ke baad hi2014 main hue loksabhaake chunaav main yediurppa kii bijepi main vaapasi hui to party kaa pradarshan bahut hi behatar rahaa
 The party got around 55 percent of the vote in the coastal region, while the Congress lost 3 percent of the vote and got 40 percent of the vote
 jedies kaa puraa vot hi khiskkar bijepi ke paas chalaa gaya
 JDS is merely 0
 3 fisadi vot mili
 In view of the 2014 voting pattern in the constituency, the BJP was ahead in 17 assembly seats, while the Congress was ahead in only 3 seats
 bijepi loksabhaa kii tarj par vidhansabha chunaav main pradarshan dohraane ke betaab he
 This is the reason why BJP has played the Hindutva card in this area from Anant Hegde to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 congress ke liye pichley chunaav ke nateezon ko doharaana kaaphi mushkil hai
 This is the reason why Siddaramaiah is trying his luck in South Karnataka as well as North Karnataka seat
 iske jariye ve donon kshetron ko saadhane kii koshish main lage hai

 Describing the Food Security Bill as 'historic', Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi asked party leaders on Saturday to take its message to the grassroots and prepare the people to fight for legal rights

 One of the leaders involved in the meeting said that the essence of Rahul's opening speech at the meeting was the same, 'we have given him a right
 aap unhen sangharsh ke liye taiyaar karen
 Rahul said that the Congress party has brought the right to food after fulfilling the promises like right to education, right to information, right to employment (MNREGA), right to identity (aadhaar)
 rahul ne pratibhaagiyon se kaha, ‘desh ke itihaas main pehali baar koi sarkaar nagarikon ko bhojan kaa adhikaar dene ke liye kanoon bana rahi he
 Take this message to blocks and villages
 ’saarvajanik vitaran pranali main visangatiyon par chintaa jataaye jane ke bich rahul ne vishwaas jataayaa ki yah vidheyak janata ko kanoonee adhikaar detaa he isliye yah sansthaanon par dabaav banayega or satahi str par badlaav honge
 One participating leader said, 'he is of the view that legal authority will bridge the gaps in the PDS
 ise kanoonee darja dene se vyavastha par dabaav banegaa or nichle str par badlaav honge
 "jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee President Saifuddin Soz quoted Rahul's address in the meeting as saying," First we must understand the whole thing properly and after that the party workers should help in convincing the people
 bharat sarkaar is vidheyak ko laa rahi he jo us str par logon ke jivan main badlaav laaegaa jis str par logon ne sangharsh kiya he
 He also said that the bill has not been brought suddenly as an ordinance
 samajha jaataa he ki rahul ne kaha, ‘hamane 2009 main yah vaayada kiya tha
 When the opposition parties did not let us pass it in Parliament, we brought the ordinance
 ’punjab main congress vidhayak dal ke netaa sunil jakhad ne apane pradesh main peedies pranali main khaamiyon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki 12,000 aise halafname hai, jinamein logon ne kaha he ki unhen peedies kii dukaanon se mitti kaa tel or anaaj nahin mila
 He also said that there is a fear among the farmers that the scheme will stop the subsidy
 rahul, thomas or ramesh ne netaaon kii tamaam ashankaon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Rahul said that party workers should tell the farmers that there is no plan to reduce subsidy on food grains during the UPA regime
 thomas ne kaha ki sarkaar kisaanon kii ashankaon ko dur karne ke liye is mudde par alag se ghoshnaa karegi
 Some state Congress presidents and Congress Legislature Party leaders also expressed concern that large scale rigging would take place in the opposition-ruled states in making the list of beneficiaries and implementing the scheme
 thomas ne kaha ki rajya khaadya ayog or jila str shikaayat nivaaran pranali ke praavdhaan hai lekin sangheey dhaanche main rajyon ko hi yojana ko lagu karnaa he
 Punjab Pradesh Congress President Pratap Singh Bajwa said in the meeting that when the opposition parties implement the plans of the Center, they put pictures of their Chief Ministers and Ministers and take full credit
 bajva ne kaha ki koi pranali banani chahie taaki vipakshi dalon kii bhi yojana ke kriyanvayan main bhoomika ho
 Madhya Pradesh Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Singh said that Rahul asked him to disseminate information about the importance of this bill to the public
 singh ne saath hi kaha ki is vidheyak ko chunaav ke saath jodna galat hoga
 According to sources, Food Minister KV Thomas said in the meeting that there is a misconception among the people that Public Distribution System (PDS) will be abolished after this law comes into force
 unhone partijanon se is dharna ko samaapt karne ko kaha
 a shocking revelation has been revealed in Pratyusha Banerjee's suicide case, popularized by the Balika Vadhu serial
 jaanch main pataa chalaa tha ki pratyusha pregnant hui thi
 He was also aborted
 aborshan ke chaar hafte baad hi pratyusha ne maut ko gale laga liya tha
 Pratyusha's broken dreams took her to that vortex of despair, where she herself died
 pratyusha kii khudakushi ko uskaa parivaar, dost or rishtedaar pyaar kii naakaami se jodakar dekh rahe the
 Meanwhile, this shocking revelation has been revealed in the police investigation
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mumbai police ne conform kar diya he suicide se pehle pratyusha banerjee ne garbhpaat karaayaa tha
 Doctors at JJ Hospital believe that Pratyusha underwent abortion on April 1, about 4 weeks before the suicide
 pratyusha ke utaras ke tishyus kaa histopathological ejamination kiya gaya tha
 It has been revealed after that
 histopathological report ke mutabik pratyusha ke garbhashay main infections mila tha
 This infection is either due to miscarriage or abortion
 prem kahaniyaan adhuri rah jaaen to anjaam bhayaavah ho sakate hai
 Pratyusha's love story was also similar
 wo hataash thi or jindagi haar baithi
 Now some surprising things are also coming out in the battle of justice
 is baat kaa khulaasa ho chukaa he ki pratyusha garbhvatee thi
 But Rahul Raj's behavior on many issues is in doubt
 is baat se to usne bhi inkaar nahin kiya ki wo usee flats main pratyusha ke saath rahata tha, jahaan wo pankhe se lataki mili
 Then how could his closest person leave him alone in such a difficult time
 police ke sawaal, rahul ke javabjaanch adhikari-kya maut ke samay pratyusha pregnant thi?rahul raaj-nahin
 Investigating Officer - She ever got pregnant while staying with you? Rahul Raj - Yes, it was in the month of January
 jaanch adhikari-janvari main kab?rahul raaj-taarikh yaad nahin he, shaayad janvari ke pehle hafte main hui thi
 When did the investigating officer-pratyusha get the abortion done? Rahul Raj did it in the first or second week of March
 jaanch adhikari -kya tumne or pratyusha ne aborshan se pehle doctorl salaah lee thi?rahul raaj -pratyusha ne ek gainicologist se salaah lee thi
 Investigating officer - were you with her in the hospital? Rahul Raj - No, she went alone, i was busy
 ab police kii jaanch isi sire ko pakadakar chal rahi he ki aakhir rahul raaj or pratyusha ke bich aisa kya hua tha ki rahul ne aise vakt main bhi usase kinaaraa kar liya
 How dark is the glamorous world of glamor, the story of Pratyusha Banerjee's death is a living example of this
 use naam mila, kaam mila, shoharat mili, daulat mili, lekin uski muhabbat use glamer ke peeche gumnaam andheron main le gai
 Things reached a point where there was no way but death
 super dancer 3 kii vinar rupasa batavyaal ko dance kii devi kahana galata nahin hoga
 What is the dance style that Rupsa cannot do
 super dancer kii shaan rahi hai rupasa
 At the age of just 6, Roopasa has convinced everyone with her dance moves
 rupasa expressant kii queen hai
 But you will be surprised to know that Roopasa never celebrates her birthday
 unki maa ne iske peeche kii vajah kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Speaking to India Today, Roopasa's mother said - We never celebrate Roopasa's birthday
 kyonki jab bhi koi happy okejan hota he rupasa biimaar ho jaati he
 Because of this she never went to Durga Puja nor did she ever celebrate her birthday and never invited the children of the neighborhood
 hamane uske janmdin par parivaar ke saath hi kek kaata he bas
 Rupasa falls ill whenever she is very excited
 bataa den ki 6 saal kii umr main wo profeshnal dancer kii tarah dance karti hai
 When Rekha touched Rupsa's feet, Shilpa Shetty kissed Rupasa's feet
 ravina tandon, mika singh, tiger shroff, salmaan khan jaise kai guest rupasa ke dance ko dekhakar hairaan ho gaye the
 Please tell that Roopasa is from Kolkata
 unke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti zyada acchhee nahin he
 But her parents have shown dance to Roopasa
 rupasa kii maa ne ek baar sho main bataaya tha ki wo kolkata main jahaan rahati hai wo jagah bahut choti he
 People's thinking is also not good
 jab main rupasa ko dance ke liye le jaati thi or der shaam lautati to log galat tareeke se dekhte the
 But today my daughter has answered them all
 salmaan khan is samay gamajada hai
 On Thursday, her pet doggie 'my Love' died
 salmaan ne apane is dukh ko big bos ke weekend kaa waar main contestants or darshakon ke bich jaahir kiya

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal has attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the transfer of officers in Bihar
 rajd ne nitish kumaar par apane ek mantri ke dabaav main aakar ek 'vivaadaaspad adhikari' ko niyukt karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari says that the transfer and posting of office bearers as per their requirement is the right of the government, but there are certain rules, benefits and traditions for this
 sarkaron se apeksha rahati he ki jab ve padaadhikariyon kaa sthanantaran yaa padasthaapan karen to inkaa dhyaan rakhaa karen
 If this does not happen, then the government starts to get bogged down and their destiny begins to doubt
 shivanand tiwari ne ek bayaan main kaha ki 'nitish kumaar ne aisa hi ek kaam kiya he jisase us par oongli uth rahi he
 People are doubting the government's intention
 vikaas ayukta ke pad par rahe ek padaadhikari kaa sthanantaran jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke sachiv ke pad par kiya gaya he
 He was changed from the Department of Water Resources to the Development Commissioner only on 31 October
 bahut saafe-suthri chhavi vaale padaadhikariyon main inaki ginati nahin hoti he
 Saryu Rai, a friend of Nitishji and a minister of the Government of Jharkhand, wrote a letter and made serious allegations against the officer
 'shivanand ke anusaar, 'sabase badi baat he ki vikaas ayukta ke pad par padasthapit padaadhikari yaa to vahiin se ritair hue hai yaa mukhya sachiv banaae gaye hai
 Recently, Shishir Kumar and Negi have taken over from the post of Development Commissioner
 isliye vikaas ayukta ke pad se punah usee pad par vaapasi kaa kya rahasy he! agar nitish kumaar ke khasham-khaas mantri ko isi padaadhikari ke saath sangat baithi hui thi, to unako vahaan se hataaya kyon gaya tha
 Whatever may be, Nitish ji has publicly taken a soot vessel on him in the desire to fulfill the wish of the Minister of Water Resources
 'darasal shivanand tiwari, arun singh naam ke ek varisht adhikari ko ek baar phir jalasansaadhan vibhaag main niyukt karne par sawaal kar rahe hai
 Arun is believed to have liked the department's minister Lalan Singh and was dissatisfied with the work of Nitish Arun Singh's development commissioner, despite this, now Janata Dal leaders believe that coming back under pressure from Lalan Singh, Tripurari Sharan For example, by running an honest officer from the department in a few months, Nitish has given the people a chance to raise their finger about their weaknesses in politics and government
 kya aapane kabhi shaadi ke liye duulhe ko toilet seat ke saath photo khinchvaate hue dekha he
 Hey, don't be surprised this is really happening
 madhya pradesh ke sihor jile main shaadi ke icchhuk duulhe apane ghar main bani toilet seat ke saath tasviir khinchvaa rahe hai taaki ve rajya sarkaar kii ore se 'mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana' ke tahat karaae jane vaale samuhik vivaah main ise pruf kii tarah istemaal kar saken
 In fact, the state government has made it mandatory under the 'mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana' that only boys who have toilets in their homes will be registered for community marriage
 'mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana' ke tahat rajya sarkaar shaadishuda jode ko 15,000 rupee nagad or kai uphaar bhi detii he
 In such a situation, prospective grooms are leaving no stone unturned to fulfill this condition
 adhikariyon ke mutabik 'mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana' ke tahat registration karwaane ke liye shaadi ke icchhuk duulhe ko toilet seat ke saath vaali apni ek photo jamaa kerani jaruri he taaki yah sabit ho sake ki uske ghar main shauchalay he
 It is worth noting that the Union Ministry of Rural Development provides funds to the state government for sanitation infrastructure in rural areas
 lekin madhya pradesh sarkaar ne badi chaalaaki se ise mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana se jod diya he

 The lower court, in its order, said that the case states that what Singh, and other political office bearers including BJP leaders arrested in the case, did is unthinkable and all this was done to harm the functioning of Parliament

 One of these satellites was created by the students of IIT Bombay after eight years of hard work, namely 'pratham'
 'pratham' kii antariksh main umr mahaz 4 maheene kii he, lekin isse akaash main phir ek baar desh ne lambii chalaang lagaai he
 However, Satish Dhawan reached the Space Center by sitting in the 'first' Toyota Innova to be launched by rocket into space
 9 bajkar 12, sriharikota se PSLV-C35 antariksh kii ore uda, halchal spes centre se 1290 kilometre dur iaiti bombai main hui
 Mission launched in 2008, around 11 on 26 September 2016
 30 baje puraa hua
 After the launch, former project manager Manvi Dhawan said that all my focus was only on this monitor, in the last moments i could feel my beats
 pariyojna kii mushkilon ke bare main bataate hue sanyam ne kaha, 'ham puraa dizin final kar chuke the, tabhi hamen pataa laga ki agar aapkaa upgrah kisi or ke raste main aata he, use pareshaan karata he to use nasht kar dena padegaa
 After this, we had to change the entire design, for which we had a non-stop meeting for 40 hours, yet we finished the whole work in the prescribed time
 'pratham' kaa vazan 10
 15 kg, it will remain in space for 4 months
 tippaniyan The most important function of the first is to count the molecule or electron in the ionosphere
 is satellite main Lithium-ion bydaree lagaayi gayi he, bydaree se judane vaale chaaron said main saura urja ke liye solar panel lagaaye gaye hai
 Explaining the usefulness of 'pratham', former student Johnny Jha said that it will help in predicting tsunami along with improving GPS signal
 is satellite ko banane main IIT bombai ke 5 batch main takreeban 150 chaatr shaamil rahe
 If all goes well, with the help of 'pratham', the navigation system and GPS system of the defense can be improved, in addition to this the data can also be used for other scientific research

 Laxmanrao Inamdar is also considered as the political guru of Modi
 inaamdaar ne 1969 main sahakaar bharti ke naam se bada sahakaari andolan chalaaya tha
 On this occasion, the Prime Minister also released two books related to Lakshmanrao Inamdar
 modi or vakil sahabmodi ne sirf sardaar patel kii kaansya pratimaaon or swami vivekanand ke calandaron se prerana lee he
 But when the mention of Inamdar, who is called a lawyer, comes to the turning point in the story
 bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani ke sadsy sheshadri chaari ke anusaar narendra modi ne apane shuruaati saal sangh main gujaarey or un par sabase zyada asar vakil sahab kaa rahaa
 On this occasion, Modi said that now the need is that people working in the field of cooperatives meet the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022 by growing bee-keeping and seaweed, i
e
, the vegetation produced in sea water
 Do it modi ne kaha ki agar desh main kisaanon kii sthiti ko behatar karnaa he or unki aamadani ko dugana karne kaa lakshya ko hasil karnaa he to sahakaarita kshetra ko iske liye badi bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 Giving the example of white revolution, the Prime Minister said that cooperatives played such a role in the production of milk, which changed the lives of farmers completely
 sahakaarita ke safal hone ke liye jaruri he ki kisaan apni jarurat kii chijen thok bhav main kharid sake or apni utpaadan ko retail kii keemton par bech sake taaki bichauliyon kii munafkhori se bachaa ja sake
 He said that at present the situation in the country is such that farmers do not get full price, but middlemen take advantage of it
 lekin agar sahakaarita kii bhoomika bade to aisa nahin hoga
 Modi said that at present, in most parts of the country, cooperatives are limited to sugar and milk production, but there has been a lot of competition
 isliye jaruri he ki sahakaarita kii safalataa ko nae-nae kshetron main aajamaaya jaae
 Modi gave many new suggestions to the people of the cooperative sector at a function held at Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi, in which cooperatives can play a role
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jab se desh main neem coted uria kaa utpaadan shuru hua he, tab se neem kii khapat or jarurat bahut bad gai he
 In such a situation, the production and sending of neem leaves and fruits can be a new area for cooperatives
 isi tarah se madhumakhi paalan ko bade paimaane par karke kisaan isse apni aamadani badha sakate hai
 Modi said that the rainy season is difficult for the people engaged in this fish farming, because at that time, due to the weather, going to the sea becomes very less
 aise main kisaan sahakaari samiti banaakar samandar ke kinare sivid kii kheti kar sakate hai jis ki aajkal dawa ke kshetra main bahut maang he

 notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke liye jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aath november kaa din chunaa to shaam tak logon ko isaki kaanon kaan khabar nahin thi
 a few minutes before the announcement came the news that the Prime Minister was going to address the country
 kayaas lagate rahe ki sargical strike se lekar raajnneeti tak koi ahm baat modi kah sakate hai
 But the opposite happened
 yah ghoshnaa 500 or 1000 kii notebandi kii ghoshnaa thi
 But all kinds of doubts are raising their head regarding this decision declared by the BJP as historic
 ghoshnaa ke samay or manshaa ko lekar andeh vyakt kiye ja rahe hai
 There are stories which misrepresent the government-promoted details or question their veracity
 masalan, tazaa reportein bhartiya janata party dwaara notebandi se thik pehle zameenon kii kharid kii he
 Some media have revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party has purchased crores of land in Bihar just before demonetisation
 itnaa hi nahin, bihar ke bhaajapa netaaon ne sweekaara bhi he ki zamin kharidne main nakad bhugtan bhi kiya gaya he
 This money was given by the people as donations to the party
 bihar ke hi bhaajapa netaaon kii maane to party ne rajya main hi nahin balki deshbhar main november ke pehle saptaah tak kai zaminein khridi hai
 Some of these land purchase papers have also come out in which the name of the party's officials is mentioned and elsewhere the land has been purchased in the name of the party from the party's Delhi address
 sawaal or bhi hanisase pehle yah jaankaree bhi saamne ai he ki bhartiya janata party kii bengal ikai kii ore se aath november kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle teen karod rupee party ke khate main jamaa karaae gaye hai
 a portion of this amount was in the 500 and 1000 notes
 in khabaron ke aadhaar par andeh vyakt kiya ja rahaa he ki kya notebandi kii ghoshnaa se pehle party ke logon ko isaki jaankaree mil gai thi
 Or were there signs of demonetisation in the party
 doordarshan main kaam karne vaale ek yuva patrkaar satyendra murali ne to guuruuvaar ko baqayada ek press conference karke bataaya ki pradhanmantri kaa jo sambodhan aath november kii raat ko aath baje se doordarshan par live bataakar dikhaaya gaya tha, wo darasal pehle se recorded tha
 With this, the information given by the government related to the announcement of demonetisation can prove to be false
 haalanki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki party satta main he or lagaataar kuch na kuch chizein party ke hit main kharidti or banaati rahati he
 In such a situation, these amounts are small for a national party and they are not going to benefit so much that the Prime Minister should put his truth at stake
 nishane par modilekin in baton main agar satyata he to yah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye ek kaaphi buree khabar he
 That is because he himself is responsible for this decision
 yah unka faisla tha, party kaa nahin
 The members of the party and the cabinet did not even know it until the last time
 khud pradhanmantri jab ghoshnaa karne ke liye logon ke saamne aae to na to unke saath vittamantri arun jetali the or na hi arabiai ke governor urjit patel
 It was a declaration made with a voice and a face that only one person was to be credited and that is Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin shrey na bante to aarope bhi bantate nahin hai
 If the things and doubts that are coming up intermittently, they are targeting anyone, then it is Narendra Modi
 or aisa isliye he kyonki yah faisla modi kaa apana faisla he or unhone hi liya he
 The government also says the same and the party too
 yani kaledhan par sargical strike kaa shrey lene valepradhanmantri kii is ghoshnaper agar andeh gaharaata gaya or tathyon main aniyamitata pramanit ho pai to iskaa sidhaa asar modi kii apni chhavi par padegaa
 Modi and his party are already worried over the announcement that the land will become chaotic
 lekin is ghoshnaa ke peeche kii manshaa or sakshya agar dohare sabit hote hai to modi or bhi zyaada ghire or kamazor pad jaaenge
 This will be Modi's own part and his party will not be able to participate in it

 Apart from legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar, several former cricketers such as former chief selectors k Srikkanth, Atul Vasan and Abbas Alig Baig are talking about his removal

 England won the Test series after 28 years in India by winning the fourth and final test draw here in Nagpur, 2–1
 gavaskar ne iske baad kaha ki samay aa gaya he ki chayankarta bhavishya par dhyaan den kyonki dhoni shrinkhalaa main lay main nahin dikhe
 Former Indian captain Gavaskar said, 'till the fourth day of this Test, i kept saying that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has no option but after Virat scored a century in difficult conditions, i feel that he has discovered a good thing about himself
 mujhe lagata he ki vah jimmedaari lene ke liye taiyaar he
 'gavaskar said,' i think it should be looked at in a positive way because this is the future
 ’ shrikant kaa maananaa he ki dhoni captaini ke bhaar ke bina zyada behatar sabit ho saktaa he
 Srikanth said, "dhoni's captaincy has become dull and he is unable to know what to do when things are left out of his hands
" use ab se test captain nahin hona chaiye
 If i were the chairman of the selectors, i would have selected Dhoni as the wicketkeeper and batsman in the team
 ’shrikant ne kaha, ‘mai dhoni ko wicketiper or ballebaaj isaliye chunata kyonki uskaa cricket ko diya gaya yogadan kaaphi ahm he
 i think if he does not captain, he can contribute much better to the team
 ’ purv cricketer abbaas ali beg ne bhi captaini main badlaav kii maang kii or kaha ki kohli ko yah jimmedaari deni chahie
 He said, 'we have to think about the future and plan accordingly
 ’ dhoni ko 2007 vishwa twanti20 championships jeetne ke baad ‘captain kool’ pukaara jane laga, lekin pichley do saal main videshi sarajameen par test main kharaab pradarshan se un par sawaal uthne lage
 After losing the home series to England, India's batting flaws were exposed after the retirement of middle-order batsman Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman
 purv bhartiya spinner bishan singh bedi ne bhi dhoni ko captaini se hataane kii maang kii
 He said, 'dhoni should consider himself lucky that he is still there (captain)
 agar tiger pataudi yaa sunil gavaskar ne itane test ganvaa diye hote to ve itane lambey samay tak nahin tike rahete’ bedi ne kaha, ‘usne captain bane rahane ke liye zyada kuch nahin kiya he
 He should have been eliminated only after winning the World Cup
 ’unhone poocha, ‘vah test captain nahin he
 You need a captain who is a contender for his place in the playing XI
 mujhe bataaiye ki uske 99 ran team ke kisi kaam ke the
 Bedi believes that Kohli should be given the command of the team
 unhone kaha, ‘aap aisa nahin kah sakate ki ham kisi anya khilaadi ko captain nahin bana sakate? main viraat kohli ko captain banaaunga
 He has a sharp cricketer mind
 aapako yuvaaon par bharosa karnaa hoga

 He also said that the party will intensify its campaign with regard to slum dwellers with many such facilities

 During the night break, the slum dwellers had put all their problems in front of BJP state president Tiwari

 Tiwari then took up the matter with Sardar RP Singh before Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
 is par sangyaan lete hue anil baijal ne shauchalay main lagane vaale shulk ko hataane kaa nirdesh jari kiya tha
 In this regard, RP Singh had called a press conference at bjp's state headquarters, where talking to reporters, Singh said that about 18 lakh women live in 6 lakh slums of Delhi and about 21 crore 60 from them for bathing and toileting every month
 Lakhs are recovered
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi kii baat karne karne vaali dilli sarkaar mahilaon kii is badi samasya se bekhbar he
 RP Singh said that millions of women are forced to defecate and bathe in the open to avoid expenses
 unhone kaha ki garibi or laachaari ke chalate jhuggi basti kii lakhon mahilaayein khule main shouch or snaan karne se sharmasaar hai
 But the shameless Kejriwal government of Delhi is not licking its ears
 unhone kaha ki jahaan khule main shouch karne se lakhonmahilaayein apamaanitaho rahi hai, vahiin aisi vyavastha ke chalate jhuggi bastiyon ke aasapaas gandagi or beemaari kaa maahaul bana hua he
