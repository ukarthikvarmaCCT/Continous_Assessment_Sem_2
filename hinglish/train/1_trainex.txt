 These meetings are called bajam

 In fact, most people here work in Mumbai
 vahaan ve 8-9 maheene jamkar kamaate hai or phir 3-4 maheene gaanv main bitaate hai, apane bhare-puure parivaar ke saath
 How do people living in a busy and bustling city like Mumbai sit silently in the village? How to cut their time? The people of the previous generation here probably had already guessed this problem
 unhone apane aap ko parivaar or gaanv se jode rakhane ke liye bajmon kaa anoothaa tarika ijad kiya
 Now the youth of this place are also following that tradition vigorously
 gaanv ke bich kii ek bajm ko dekhie
 Here, 10-12 people are sitting on wooden mools in a room and are having hot cups of hot tea with great pleasure
 tabhi ek kone main baithe mohammad saleem bol padate hai, ''yaar kaalu, aaj chaay main pehle jaisi kadaki nahin thi

 hansi-m
 Along with Jacques, Latifebaji, things of business and village, house and family go on here
 shaadi, nai gaadi, dukaan yaa phi r nae makaan kii khushi main jamkar daavatein bhi hoti hai
 The unannounced custom of these bjams that has been in operation for years, is that no outsider enters the bajam
 ek bajm ke ali bhai bataate hai ki ''jaruri kaam hone par hi koi bahari vyakti aata he
 "if Ali Bhai ki obey", these bajrams make it easy to cut together with the people of village and family for 3-4 months of vacation
 '' harek bajm main aath-das sadsy to maujuud rahete hi hai

 aswin ko ab 12 se 15 sitambar taklicestershrake khilaaf gharelu match khelnaa he or antim match 25 se 28 sitambar tak daraham ke khilaaf hoga
 If Ashwin is allowed to play both these matches, then he will not be available for odis against Australia

 is ap par 150 rupee se lekar 500 rupee tak kaa saamaan uplabdh he
 Money received from the sale of Namo App will be sent to the Clean Ganga Fund
 yahi nahi bijepi ke kosh main 5 rupee tak donneton diya ja saktaa he
 For which a new feature of micro donation has been introduced
 jisamen 5 rupee se lekar ek hajaar rupee tak donneton kaa opshan he
 Significantly, from time to time, PM Modi has also used the Namo app to talk to the common people
 kuch samay pehle hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne karnataka main bhaajapa ke mahila morche kii padaadhikariyon or kaaryakartaaon se ‘ namo ap ' ke jariye baatcheet ke dauraan kaha tha ki aaj desh mahila vikaas se aage badhkar mahila ke netritv baat kar rahaa he
 When there is such a mantra for the development of the country, BJP also believes in this mantra
 supreme court ne kaveri jal vivaad par somvaar ko 5 sitambar ke apane faisle main sansodhan karte hue karnataka ko thodi raahat di
 The Supreme Court said that for Tamil Nadu, Karnataka should release only 12 thousand cusecs of water from the Cauvery river instead of 15 thousand cusecs
 kinartak ne supreme court se apil kii thi ki use 15 hajaar kusek kii jagah 1 hajaar kusek hi pani chhodane kaa nirdesh diya jaae, jise adaalat ne nahin mana
 The Supreme Court had earlier directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of water for Tamil Nadu
 sarvocch adaalat ne somvaar ko apane faisle main kaha ki lau and order kii sthiti keydaalat kaa aadeshlagu na karaane ke liye aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Know what is the whole controversy 
 
 kaveri jal vivaad angrejon ke samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 An agreement was reached between the two in 1924, but later Kerala and Puducherry also became involved in the dispute, making it more difficult
 1972 main gathit ek cameti kii report ke baad 1976 main kaveri jal vivaad ke sabhi chaar daavedaaron ke bich agreement kiya gaya, jisaki ghoshnaa sansad main hui
 Despite this, the dispute continued
 1986 main tamilnadu ne antarraji jal vivaad adhinium (1956) ke tahat centre sarkaar se ek tribunel kii maang kii
 The Tribunal was formed in 1990
 tribunel ne faisla kiya ki karnataka kii ore se kaveri jal kaa tay hissaa tamilnadu ko milegaa
 Karnataka believes that it was a princely state during the British rule while Tamil Nadu was a slave to the British, hence the 1924 agreement was not justified
 karnataka kaa kahana he ki tamilnadu kii tulana main vahaan krishi der se shuru hua
 He is first in the path of the river, he has full authority over it
 tamilnadu puraane samjhauton ko tarksangat bataate hue kahata he, 1924 ke samjhaute ke anusaar, jal kaa jo hissaa use miltaa tha, ab bhi vahi mili
 The Center set up the tribunal on June 1990 and so far efforts are on to resolve the dispute

 What name should be given to this spirit? If they could have given some time to their country, we would have seen the development of enterprises in Begusarai today, but what do we see?

 Ravish Kumar asked if Kanhaiya Kumar will marry after the election? To this, he said that it would take time to 'find trouble partner'

 Modi government is going to take a big step to improve the banking system
 sarkaar ek aisa bill lekar aa rahi he jo yadi paas ho gaya to bank diwalia hone kii surat main apane upar aae sankat se apane hi sansadhano kaa istemaal kar ubregaa
 However, if this happens, your money deposited in banks will also be at stake
 financial rejolution and diposit insurance(echardiai) bill -2017 kaa masauda taiyaar he
 It can be tabled in Parliament during this winter session and if this bill is passed, many things will change for you along with the banking system
 kya he echardiai bilfinancial rejolution and diposit insurance bill(echardiai bill) vittiya sansthaanon ke diwalia hone kii sthiti se nipatane ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Whenever a bank will not be able to conduct its business and will not be able to return the money of the common people deposited with them, this FRDI bill will help that bank to get out of this crisis
 kisi bhi bank, insurance company or anya vittiya sansthaanon ke diwalia hone kii sthiti main use is sankat se ubhaarne ke liye yah kanoon laayaa ja rahaa he
 This is therefore worrying for the common man
 In this proposed law, a proposal of 'bel in' is given
 agar is prastaav ko maujuuda masaude ke hisaab se lagu kar diya jaataa he, to bank main rakhe aapke paison par aapkaa puraa haq nahin rahegaa
 However, you can be given shares and other securities in exchange for your money
 kya hota he bel-inbel-in kaa saadhaaran shabdon main matlab he ki apane nuksaan kii bharpai karjadaaron or jamakartaon kii jeb se karnaa
 When he feels that he is in trouble and he needs to make up for it, he will be able to use the accumulated money of the common man to bridge his deficit
 haalanki vitt mantri arun jetali ne is prastaav ko puri tarah paribhaashit karne ke liye kaha he, jo philhal masaude main kiya nahin gaya he
 He said that a lot of changes can be made in it
 isko lekar aam logon se suzav bhi maange jaaenge
 Your money, security in the bank, in your hands, whatever amount you hold in the bank, the amount up to Rs 1 lakh is always safe
 isamen aapako milane vaala byaaj bhi shaamil hota he
 This guarantee comes from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jab koi bank diwalia ho jaataa he or vah jamakartaon ke paise lautaane main sakasham nahin hota, to bhi is sthiti main use jamakartaon ko 1 lakh rupee tak kii raashi deni hogi
 Think of it like this if you have kept 5 lakh rupees in a bank
 kisi vajah se vah bank diwalia ho jaataa he
 If he is not in a position to pay depositors money, then even in such a situation he will have to pay at least 1 lakh rupees
 haalanki 1 lakh se zyada jitani bhi rakam hogi, uski suraksha kii koi guarantee nahin he
 Deposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation will cease to exist if FRDI becomes law, not fixed in new bill
 isaki jagah rejolution corporation le legi
 This committee will work under the Ministry of Finance
 yah samiti hi tay karegi ki bank main rakhi aapaki kitni rakam bainkon ke diwalia hone kii sthiti main surakshit rahegi
 That is why it has been said in Chintabil that your money kept in the bank will get security cover, but it has not been clear how much amount and in which situation it will be received
 haalanki kuch visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki nae bill main suraksha cover kii maujuuda rakam, jo ki ek lakh he, use badhaayaa ja saktaa he

 Such a government which has recovered from the phase of bowing down to its acts that demoralize the powerful Congress - Baba Ramdev
 lekin congress jis bhi anachaahe nattejey kii kalpana kar sakati thi, ve saare nattejey hakeekat ban gaye or is karrwai kii pratikriya kadam-dar-kadam kaabo se baahar hoti gai
 This action brought Baba Ramdev and Anna Hazare together

 The scenes of police tear gas shells, sticks and stones being fired at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, Ramdev's supporters, many of whom were unable to defend themselves, fueled public outrage
 halaat jaliyanvaala baag jaise na the, lekin anna hajaare tak ne 8 june ko rajghat par din bhar anshan karke naaraazgi jataai

 Ramdev also wants special courts to be set up to deal with corruption cases and the corrupt people should be given the death penalty
 hajaare ke andolan kaa mukhya lakshya lokapal vidheyak he
 Unsurprisingly, the government also brought unity in the huge power of the influential middle class and common people of the big cities

 ’ The success that Shubham dreamed of becoming an IAS in the fifth grade was achieved in the third attempt
 is baar kii civil services exam main chhathesthaan par aae shubham gupta kaa kahana he ki sapane ve nahin hote jinhen aap ankhe band kar dekhte hai, balki sapane ve hote hai jo khuli ankhon se dekhe jate hai
 Shubham's dream of becoming a collector was shown by his father when he was just studying in class five and he too left no stone unturned in realizing this dream, even though he had to make three attempts
 apane pehle prayaas main ve kaamyaab nahin ho sake jabaki duusari baar unka chunaav indian audit and acount services (IAAS) ke liye kiya gaya lekin shubham ko to iees hi bananaa tha lihaaja mehnat jari rahi or isbaar aakhirkaar manzil mil hi gai
 In many ways, Shubham is different from others, usually those who have a good rank keep themselves away from social media, while this does not apply to Shubham, he was of course short of time but still there was no let up in preparation
 
 NDTV india se apni baatcheet main shubham ne bataaya ki ve pichley do baar se intervyuu main achche number nahin laa paa rahe the jisaki vajah se rank bhi achche nahin mili
 This time he changed his strategy and used social media to improve the scope and personality of his information, the results are now in front of the world
 shubham bataate hai ki civil services ke liye mahaj kitaabi gyaan hi kaaphi nahin hota balki aapke aasapaas ho rahi ghatnaayen bhi kaaphi myne rakhti hai
 This develops a better mindset and you can become a better civil servant
 jaipur ke rahane vaale shubham ne apana grajuation iconomics se kiya he
 They also want to share their tips to other students taking the civil services exam
 ve kehete hai ki aap civil sarvent kyon bananaa chaahate hai, iskaa jawaab aapako jarur dhundhna chahie varanaa is lambey safar kii kadi taiyaari ke dauraan aap hataash bhi ho sakate hai
 Apart from this, you have to read some books frequently and constantly improve yourself
 shubham kaa sandesh saaf he- agar aapako suraj kii tarah chamakna he to suraj kii tarah jalanaa bhi hoga, aapako itani mehnat kerani hogi ki aap apane haath kii lakiron ko badal saken

 mahabuuba mufti boleen ki jab mufti said sahab kaa dehanth hua to party ke hi kuch log dikkatein paidaa kar rahe the or bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye dabaav banaaya gaya
 He said that i had to leave behind many big issues like power projects for this
 unhone kaha ki kuch log aise the jo party ko todakar bijepi ke saath ja sarkaar bananaa chaahate the, in sabhi ne meri sthiti ko lagaataar kamjor kiya
 He again stressed that the mandate received by the public was ruined by Narendra Modi
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main jab se bhartiya janata party or pidipi kaa gathbandhan tutaa he tabhi se kai netaa party chhod chuke hai
 Just two days ago Javed Mustafa Mir left the PDP
 mir ko pidipi ke sansthaapak sadasyon or mufti mohammad said ke khaas logon main se gina jaataa tha
 Mustafa Mir is said to have been a staunch opponent of the decisions of Mehbooba Mufti and his differences with the party high command were steadily increasing
 jis dauraan bijepi-pidipi saath main sarkaar chalaa rahe the, tabhi bhi vah virodh main bayaan dete the
 Not only Mir but many other leaders have also left the PDP in the last one year
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha chunaav ke baad pidipi-bijepi ne saath main aakar sarkaar banaai thi, lekin kuch hi samay main gathbandhan tut gaya
 Presently President's rule is in force in Jammu and Kashmir

 dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav kii tareekhen najadik aate hi sabhi siyaasi dalon ne qamar kas lee he
 It is time to go among the public, to make promises and to ask for votes, but this time the election of the Municipal Corporation is proving to be crooked for all political parties
 das saal se nigam kii satta main kabiz bijepi anti inakambency jhel rahi he, to vahiin 2 saal se dilli main raaj kar rahi aam aadmi party bhi logon kaa gussa jhel rahi he
 For Congress, the election of the corporation can prove to be a fight to save its existence
 aise main kya he janata kaa mood yah jaanane ke liye ajtak pahunchaa dilli ke chandani chowk vidhansabha ke puraane chandraval gaanv or jayja liya is gaanv kaa
 The corporation has a demolition house even before it enters Chandrawal village of Ward 78
 aas-paas ke ilaakon se kachra yahaan jamaa hota he or phir damping yard tak bheja jaataa he
 This slop house built of garbage has bad smell in the surrounding areas
 gaanv main ghuste hi bai taraf ek purana snaan ghar he
 Made 15 years ago, but today lies dead
 logon kii shikaayat he bigadane ke baad ise banane ke liye koi nahin aayaa
 Elections continued, leaders kept coming, asking for votes but no one came to work
 thodaa aage jate hi ek purana baraat ghar he
 Although the park was to be built here, but now there is a procession home
 lekin logon kaa aarope he is baraat ghar ko ek nijee enjio ko saunp diya gaya he
 a resident of this village, Amit says, a park and 12 houses are needed here, but now it has been given to an ngo
 gaanv ke paas hi vah ilaaka he jahaan ghusane se pehle aap sau baar sochenge
 It is a human settlement to say, but the situation here is worse than bad
 basti main pani to he, lekin nikasi ke liye siver line nahin
 Two years ago, Aam Aadmi Party leader Alka Lamba was elected as MLA on the broom trail, but after 2 years, people have alleged that the MLA never appeared again
 yahi haal nigam main shasit BJP kaa he
 Despite all the complaints, not a single representative of the corporation came to hear the problem
 siver line kii haalat itani karaab he ki jab koi nahin aayaa to logon ne khud hi paisa jamaa kar saaf safai karwaai
 Rehana says that people come to ask for votes, but disappear in our time of need, nobody listens to us
 logon kaa aarope he ki na kejariwal ne kuch kiya naemsidine
 Now that the elections are at its head, the people of this region hope that the leader will come back and ask for votes, but this time will not get votes so easily

 com / sb5vpweyhi— ICC (@icc)january 22, 2019 The Meteorological Department has issued a red and orange alert in many districts of Kerala
 kerala main monsoon kamazor tha magar ashanka he ki kai zilon main baari barish ho sakati he
 On the other hand, the fall of the wall and the building is not stopping during the rainy days in Mumbai
 abhi 2 july ko malad main baari barish main diwaar girane se 22 log maare gaye the, 94 log ghayal ho gaye the
 a building collapsed in Dongri area on Tuesday
 yah imaarat khataranaak ghoshit thi
 Ten people were killed and nine people were injured in the accident
 biemasi ne is saal 499 building ko khataranaak ghoshit kiya he
 These are buildings that have become quite old
 niyamon kaa ulanghan kar banaai gai hai
 For the building that fell on Tuesday, the BMC issued a letter in 2017 that this building should be evacuated early and demolished because BMC would not be responsible if the accident happened
 sawaal yah bhi he ki do saal tak phir kyon nahin giraaya gaya
 BMC made such a list last year as well
 619 imaaraton ko khataranaak ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 In 2017, there were two incidents of building collapse in September
 majgaanv main building girane se 61 log mar gaye the
 This building was owned by BMC
 usee saal bhindi bazaar ilaake main ek paanch manzila imaarat gir gai
 It was declared dangerous
 isamen 33 log mar gaye the
 In July 2017, a five-story building at Ghatkopar collapsed
 12 log mar gaye the
 More than 200 people have died in the last five years in the building collapse in Mumbai
 iske baad bhi ham yahi bahes kar rahe hai ki biemasi apana kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Buildings are being declared dangerous and are not to be demolished
 indian express ne pichley saal agast main ek report chhaapi thi
 According to that report, there were 2704 incidents of building and wall collapses in Mumbai in 5 years
 840 log ghayal hue the or 234 log maare gaye the
 BMC has this information in response to an RTI
 jab tak javabdehi tay nahin hogi or sakht kadam nahi uthaae jaaenge ham haadason ko jodate rah jaaenge
 The Guardian newspaper published an analysis in September of 2017 as to why people live in these dangerous homes even after fears of a fall
 puraani imaaraton ke maalik in imaaraton ko banavaane kii kshamta nahin rakhte hai
 They themselves leave these houses and go on rent
 kiraaye par lene vaale ye log kam aamadani hone vaale hote hai, inhen mumbai main sasta ghar mil jaataa he
 BMC sends notice that vacate the house, it has to be demolished, even then people do not vacate the house due to different reasons
 ek kaaran yah bhi he ki jab imaarat girti he to unhen transit camp main jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 They do not know when the building will fall, when it will be built
 gardian ne chandsekhar prabhu kaa bayaan chapa he
 Prabhu says that the plans to demolish these dangerous buildings are mostly for evacuating people with low economic potential
 yojanaayen to garibon ke naam par banati hai lekin is prakriya main vah sadak par hota he or bade buildiron kii chaandi ho jaati he
 But even if not emptied, the poor also go poor
 gardinyan kii is report ko padhate hue samaj aata he ki kyon log aisi imaaraton main rahete hai
 If they vacate the house, then the employment will be lost, if they stay in the house then life will be lost
 pension kii puraani vyavastha ko behaal karne ke liye jo log andolan karte rahe hai unke liye ek khabar he
 The government has said that it will not resume the old pension scheme
 2004 main neshnal pension system aayaa tha
 Till then he used to get a fixed amount of pension
 neshnal pension skim bazaar se link he
 There were many agitations to restore the old pension system before the elections, this answer from the government will bring clarity and there will be no confusion that the old system can be implemented
 aam taur par sarkarein aise mudde par saaf-saaf nahin bolti hai
 But this time the government has made it clear that the old pension system will not apply
 bijepi ke saansad rakesh singh or shrirodmal nagar ne vitt mantralay se yah sawaal poocha tha ki kya puraani vyavastha lagu karne par vichaar kar rahi he, vitt rajya mantri anuraag thakur ne likhit jawaab main kaha he ki badhate hue or avahneey pension bill ke kaaran sarkaar ne fiks pension yojana kii jagah enpies apnaane kaa suvichaarit kadam uthaaya he
 This change has helped the limited resources of this government in more productive and socioeconomic development
 1 janvari 2004 ke baad bhartee hue karmchaariyon ko puraani pension vyavastha kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 Many employees keep messaging us to raise the issue of old pension scheme, i think there will be no need now because they have got good news from the government
 vaise yah kushkabari hamaare liye he ki log ab tang nahin karenge
 Once again, tell us that the old pension system will no longer be applicable
 na hi sarkaar kii aisi manshaa he
 Whether a selfie promotes a scheme, its success is ensured, does the selfie get inspiration, if the answer was yes then there would have been a flood of inspiration in our country today
 har lamhaa soshal media par anginat taadaad main selfi aplod hoti rahati he
 On the day of Guru Purnima, India's Human Resource Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has released a video message and talked about doing selfie with Guru
 aap apane guru ke saath selfi khinchaaen or soshal media par aplod karen
 The education minister said to do selfie with guru
 to kiijie
 did you do
 apane guru ke saath selfi lee or soshal media par kuch likhaa
 Did your college or university inspire you to do so, as UGC secretary Rajneesh Jain has requested in his mandate to motivate his students to take part in the Selfie with Guru campaign
 agar aap aaj prerit hone se miss kar gaye to koi baat nahin, shikshak diwas aa rahaa he, us din pehle se hi prerit hone kii taiyaari kar lijiega
 On 15 July, the Minister of Human Resources called for Selfie with Guru
 us din unka janmdin bhi tha
 In the Twitter handle of the education minister, many students have also taken pictures with their teachers taking selfies
 zaruri nahin ki shikshak hi hon, maa bhi hai, or koi dost bhi ho saktaa he
 The minister's handle is full of photographs
 khud mantri ji ne vivekanand ke saath apni selfi lekar photo daali he
 As soon as the selfie tweet came with Guru, Shikshamitra of Uttar Pradesh tagged that he too is a guru
 1000 se adhik shiksha mitra maut ko gale laga chuke hai
 You tell us when we will get justice
 ek lakh 72 hazaar shikshamitra insaaf kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 It is also strange
 mantri kah rahe hai ki selfi vid guru karen, guru kah rahe hai ki guru ko insaaf de den
 Many institutions have lovingly followed this humble request
 iaiti dilli, iaiti madras, enaiti silchar ne selfi vid guru kii tasviren twit kii hai
 Jamia's website states that students are requested to share the picture with their mentor, and write about their guru in 100 words which will be shared on the Jamia Millia Islamia Facebook page
 yah ham isliye bhi bataa rahe hai ki aaj aapako pataa bhi nahin hoga ki bharat ke tamaam skool collejon main selfi vid guru kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 Shivangi Prabhudesai tweeted that, supporting the vision of the government, i am presenting a selfie with my guru, my guru ie Shivangi
 yani shivangi kii guru aap hi hai
 Selfie with Guru has also been held at Banaras Hindu University
 is handle se pataa chalata he ki selfi vid guru ke kai events hue hai
 IIT Madras has tweeted from its official Twitter handle
 unke yahaan bhi selfi vid guru manaaya gaya he
 In this way many institutions have celebrated Selfie with Guru
 ek taraf jahaan harshollas se bharat ke yuva selfi vid guru manaa rahe the vahiin is harsh kii ghadi main kendriya vidyalayon ke shikshak pension kii baat kar rahe hai
 Perhaps they need more pension at this time, less selfie
 punam shrivastav ne maanav sansaadhan mantri ko tag karte hue likhaa he ki 30-35 saal tak niswaarth seva karne ke baad bhi hamaara yah haal he
 Pension is not available
 is kaaran bhukhon marane kii naubat aa gai he
 Could it be that these teachers are given pension and the campaign for selfie with pension goes on
 hamane is par itnaa jor isliye diya taaki yaad rahe ki chaatro ke liye zaruri kya he
 The government wants to inspire, but who should motivate people to do their work
 mantri se lekar mantralayon ko patr likhane ke baad bhi shikshakon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota he
 Why this campaign of unilateral motivation cannot be two-way
 kyon nahin selfi vid samasya abhiyaan chale or sarkaar selfi vid samaadhaan ke saath jawaab de
 There should be no teacher in the college, no system of teaching, no laboratory, no problem, there should be a Selfie with Guru
 bharat sarkaar ne nai shiksha niti kaa draft pesh kiya he
 The 484-page draft was given one month to read, understand and respond
 aap is draft ke reating vaale chapter par jaaiye
 The National Assessment and Accreditation Council ranks NAC College and University
 har college main jaakar vahaan kii suvidhaon or uplabdhiyon ko dekhakar e bi si di grad detaa he
 Know the truth of this, then one day a campaign of Selfie with Average College started
 nack kii report ke anusaar 68 pratishat uniwarsity ausat yaa ausat se bhi neeche hai
 91 percent of colleges are average or even below average
 91 pratishat college ausat or ausat se kam hai, ummid he isamen un guruon kaa yogadan nahin hoga jinke saath aaj selfi vid guru kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 91 percent of colleges in India are below average
 ujisi 164 uniwarsity ko manyata detii he, inamen se keval 140 uniwarsity ne nack ke tahat apana moolyankan karaayaa tha
 Out of this 140 universities, only 32 universities got grades of a or above
 baaki sari uniwarsity ausat yaa ausat se neeche hai
 This is the picture of our education
 acchhee baat he ki chaatro ne bhi apane college yaa uniwarsity ke ausat yaa ausat se neeche hone kii parvaah nahin kii
 What is gained from campaigns like Selfie with Guru
 3 july 2019 ko ramesh chandra pokharial ne rajyasabha main kaha tha ki central uniwarsity main 7000 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 The Minister of Human Resources is saying that 3,44,714 posts in private to government colleges are vacant from the state to the center
 25 may ko ritika chopra ne shiksha kii haalat par ek report likhi thi
 Ritika of Indian Express covers education regularly
 unki report ke anusaar bharat bhar ke sabhi ucch shiksha main 5 lakh pad khaali hai
 These include state universities, central universities and other institutions
 desh bhar main paanch lakh shikshak nahin hai
 Until 5 lakh posts are filled, instead of Selfie with Guru, Selfie with Minus becomes a Guru
 pichley hi maheene to paryaavaran mantri ne selfi vid saowling abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 It was said that apply sapling and take selfie with it
 is selfi abhiyaan kaa ham or aap kaise moolyankan kar sakate hai
 Kapil Dev, Jackie Shroff did a selfie with sapling but where is that campaign now
 2016 main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri fadanvis ne selfi vid tree abhiyaan chaalu kiya tha
 It was said that the officer staff should plant saplings and take a selfie and send a few words to the forest department
 isamen se kuch logon ko lucky vinar chunaa jayega
 We do not know how many crores of trees were planted in 2016, how many of them are moving, how much the employees who have done selfie with tree have saved that tree
 maharashtra sarkaar kaa lakshya tha ki teen saal main 50 karod ped lagaae the
 The goal was to plant 50 crore trees
 isi june main vidhansabha main devendra fadanvis se poocha gaya tha jiske jawaab main unhone kaha ki teen saal main maharashtra ne 24 karod ped lagaae
 According to media reports, the target was to put 17 crore by 2018
 2019 main 33 karod lagane kaa lakshya tha
 The Chief Minister has given an account of 24 crore trees from 2016 to 18
 2016 main jitne ped lagaae gaye unamem se 72 pratishat batch ga
 In 2017, 80 percent of the trees planted survived
 2018 main jitne ped lagaae gaye unamem se 85 pratishat ped batch gaye
 Maharashtra claims that due to this the forest area has increased from 20 percent to 33 percent
 mashhoor paryaavarnavid madhav gadgil in abhiyaanon ko dikhaava maanate hai

 Richard Thaler, whose book is Nudge
 inhen kii theory ke aadhaar par sarkaar is tarah ke abhiyaan chalaati he jiske bare main aarthik survey ke chapter do main vistaar se likhaa he
 Under this, the emphasis is that the government motivates the people
 naj kare yani saumy tareeke se dhakka dekar apekshit vyavhaar ke liye prerit kare
 Many times we deliver such campaigns in a ridiculous state
 sansad parisar aam taur par saaf suthri rahati he magar phir bhi yahaan par saansad or mantri jhaadu lagane aae
 The biggest defense of this ritual of cleanliness is that people are motivated
 dhulakanon ko khoj khojkar buhaarne ko aap selfi vid jhaadu kah lijie lekin iskaa koi thos nateeja nahin nikalataa he
 Inspiration for everything is not so much that people leave their work and go to another house to inspire them

 '' mumbai kaa kareeb 200 saal purana siddhivinayak mandir bharat ke sabase amir mandiron main se ek he
 Filled with 158 kg gold reserves found by the offerings of devotees, 65 security personnel are engaged day and night to protect this temple
 mandir main rakhe is sone kii keemat lagbhag 67 million dollar yani 417 karod rupee ke kareeb aanki gai he
 India is the largest buyer of gold in the world and gold temples and coins worth crores of rupees are stored in old temples
 kuch saal pehle hi kerala ke padmanabh swami mandir ke gupt tahkhaane main band khajaane kii jaankaree mili, jisaki keemat kareeb 20 billian dollar yani 1,24,750 karod rupee se bhi adhik maani jaati he
 It is reported that the Modi government of the Center is going to bring a new scheme next month, in which temples will be encouraged to deposit their gold in the bank
 centre sarkaar chaahati he ki mandiron ke is sone ke bhandar kaa istemaal bhartiya arthvyavastha par lambey samay se haaavee vyapaarik asantulan ko dur karne main kiya jaae
 The Indian public's passion for gold is well known and in such a situation the government will melt the gold and give it to the jewelery makers, so that the import of gold can be curbed
 yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki march 2013 main khatm hue vittiya varsh main sone ke aayaat kaa pratishat bharat ke kul vyapaar ghate kaa 28% tha
 Sources associated with the government and the gold industry show that India imports 800 to 1000 tonnes of gold every year
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki agar mandir is yojana main ruchi dikhaate hai to desh kaa kul swarna aayaat ghatakar ek-chauthai ho jayega
 In this regard, Siddhivinayak Temple Trust President Narendra Murari Rane says, "if the scheme is profitable and safe, we will be happy to deposit our gold in national banks by being part of any such scheme of the government
" 'haalanki, mumbai ke ek sona vyapaaree kehete hai ki unhone or unke pita ne siddhivinayak mandir main ab tak takreeban 200 kilo sone kaa chadhaava chadhaaya he
 They say that it would be a sin to take interest of temples on offering of reverence
 52 saal ke is vyapaaree kaa kahana he, 'maine ishwar ke liye chadhaava chadhaaya, na ki mandir trust ke liye
 'A scheme similar to this scheme was also implemented in 1999, but that scheme did not succeed because the interest rate offered by the government to banks was much lower than the temples had expected
 us yojana ke tahat bhartiya state bank 0
 Returns an interest of 75 to 1 percent
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki us yojana ke tahat ab tak kul 15 ton sona hi bank main jamaa kiya gaya he
 At the same time, the temples say that they expect that the new scheme will provide attractive interest rates

 *** BJP member Kirti Azad on Friday warned in the Lok Sabha that if the government does not take immediate steps to take appropriate action against the so-called scandal in the name of IPL men, he will start a fast-unto-death in Ferozeshah Kotla from Sunday

 With all due respect to West Indies Cricket but i have a question for u all
 
 
 will this west Indies team qualify for Ranji quarters from the plate group? Elite se to nahin hoga # indvswihey bro didn’t see these cocky tweets vs England 
 
 
 
 but anyhow the young men will learnif English ex cricketgers had made such comments about our teams the previous tours in 2011 and 2014, how would you have reacted? disrespectfulwith all due respect
 
 
 This kind of behavior is the reason you are sitting here and tweeting instead of playing
 Very Disrespectful
 This was the exact feeling England were having when we were out there playing against them in their home ground! Don't be arrogant for no reason! Forgot that you are a sportsman ?? # indvwi # sportsmanship # staygrounded # stayhumblehow about try to be a little respectful ?? Also WI has won a test match in Eng & UAE (vs Pak) each
 They are missing few of their key players in this match
 Despite this best answer, there is no doubt that the West Indies team's performance in the first test was very poor
 is team ke ballebaajon ne to donon pariyon main nausikhiyon kii tarah pradarshan kiya tha
 The match was called off in three days due to poor performances by Caribbean batsmen
 bharat ne is match main pari ke antar se apni sabase badi jeet hasil kii thi
 Batting first in the match, the Indian team declared their innings after scoring 649 runs for 9 wickets

 Zoya Akhtar's upcoming film Gully Boy, a Mumbai-based hip-hop scene, is not a biopic — though it takes a lot from her and her Mumbai-based rapper Naji's experiences
 27 baras ke divine, jinka asli naam vivian furnandis he, kehete hai, "hamaari jindagiyon kii kuch ghatnaayen (isamen hai), masalan ranvir kaa nibhaayaa kirdaar kaise hip-hop ko khojataa he or vah usamen kaise aata he

 In this match, Virat Kohli scored an innings of 46 runs in 32 balls
 baat pandrah saal pehle kii he jab india today ne best collejon ke apane pehle surveykshan ko anjaam diya tha
 This sequence has been intact since 1997
 tab se aaj tak ucch shiksha kii tasviir kaaphi had tak badal chuki he
 The number of colleges has increased from the then figure of 9,500 to now exceeding 30,000
 inamen naam likhavane vaale chaatro kii sankhya 55 lakh se bad kar 1
 69 crore has been reached
 jo cheez pichley 15 saal main nahin badali, vah he ucch shiksha par hone vaala vimarsh
 India Today wrote in 1997 on the crisis of higher education
 ab 2012 main iity samet anya ejineering collejon kii pravesh pariksha kii nai pranali par jis tarah kaa bavaal machaa hua he, vah dikhaata he ki ucch shiksha ke akaash par ek baar phir se sankat ke badal chaa rahe hai
 Even though the number of colleges and universities has increased with the passage of time, iits still have iits or St
 Stephen's in Delhi, Lady Shri Ram, Shri Ram College of Commerce; Presidency College, Kolkata; Loyola College, Chennai; There is a paucity of institutions at the level of St
 Xavier's College in Mumbai which are able to fulfill the aspirations of the youth
 pichley 15 saal se ye college or kuch anya college ranking main sheersh par rahe hai
 It is not easy to remove the top colleges from their place, but the ranking should be such that it can increase the competition so that each of the 30,000 colleges can raise their level and try to enter the 100 if not the top 10
 sarkaar ke lihaaj se dekhen to uske liye yah kaam zyada aasaan he ki vah top kii gunvattta ko kam kar sabake liye samaan avasaron ko srujit kar de
 Actually, this is the objective of the Joint Entrance Examination for government-funded engineering colleges, over which the objections of various iits have been completely ignored
 hamaare khyal se bharat ke collejon ko ek aisi hode main nahin dhakwl dena chahie jo unhen neeche kii ore lekar jaae
 Instead they should be allowed to be a part of the race leading to the top
 is saal pichley ek dashak main pehali baar hamane apane surveykshan ko kuch vistaar dene kii disha main kadam badhaayaa he or isamen arts, science, commers, ejineering, medicine or lau ke alaava paanch nai shakhaon (stream) ko shaamil kiya he-bachaler of bijness administration (bibie), bachaler of computer aplication (bisie), maas communication or jarnalism, fine arts or fishan technology jaisi nai shakhaon ko jodna ucch shiksha main ho rahe vividhikaran or vistaar ko manyata dena he
 Two decades after the introduction of liberalization, the demand for such new professional degrees has increased which enables the youth to get attractive employment
 in paanch nai shakhaon kii maang main vruddhi sidhe taur par bhartiya arthvyavastha ke kuch kshetron main ai oochaal se judi hui he
 BCA is the only graduate level degree offered in India that makes youth programmers
 ise hasil karne ke baad ity sector main rojgaar milane main aasaani ho jaati he
 BBA students meet the lack of managers in the industry that MBA students alone cannot meet
 jarnalism or maas media to teji se badhate kshetra hai
 India is one of the few countries in the world where hand media is still growing strongly, as well as electronic and digital media is also spreading
 pichley paanch saal main bhartiya fishan or art ko duniya ke manch par bhi manyata mili he
 The domestic market of expensive fashion and art will always remain limited in the current state of per capita income, but its access to the international market has created tremendous potential for the youth
 ucch shiksha main vikalpon kaa vividhikaran sansthaanon ke liye apni jagah bana paane kaa ek avasar bhi he
 In the nineties, the National Law School of India University, Bangalore, admitted students to the twelfth pass to fill the vacant space
 is baar sheersh 25 lau sansthaanon main kai aise bhi naam shaamil hai jinka 1997 main koi astitv hi nahin tha jab india today ne pehali baar surveykshan kiya tha
 One of these names can also be taken from NALSAR, Hyderabad
 is baar bibie or bisie main apekshaakrit nae sansthaanon ne apni jagah banaai he
 The two institutions in the top five in both branches — Christ University in Bangalore and SRM University in Chennai — are private-sector deemed universities that have done excellent work in providing high-end infrastructure
 nae santhaan puraanon ke mukaable kahin zyada teji se nae corson ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal rahe hai
 For example, even after 125 years of its establishment, St
 Stephen's College in Delhi does not have a b
com degree course
 maujuuda paridrishy ko dekhne par yahi lagata he ki aane vaale samay main hamaari ucch shiksha vyavastha ko aise nijee santhaan hi chalaayenge jinhen koi sarkari madad hasil nahin hogi
 In such a situation, the government will have to do the work of regulation so that it can be ensured that the institutions that come in this area, at least for the purpose of raising money, are not reliable and cannot spoil the quality
 durbhagyapurna sthiti yah he ki vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog or ol india council on technical ajukeshan (eysitii) jaise saakh kho chuke sansthaanon kii jagah ek nayaa ucch shiksha niamak neshnal kamishan for hair ajukvshan and research banane se sambandhit bill ab bhi sansad main nahin laayaa ja sakaa he
 The introduction of this bill in Parliament will be decisive to give stability to the regulatory authority
 sarkaar ko videshi vishvavidhyalay vidheyak par bhi aam raay kaayam kerani chahie taaki bharat duniya ke kuch behtareen shikshan sansthaanon kaa mejabaan ban sake
 At any cost, the government will have to establish such a system in which private institutions can flourish well and also create healthy competition among themselves
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki aaj se 15 saal baad 2027 main india today kii ranking isi bhaavana or prayaas ko pratibimbit karti najar aegi

 unhone kaha ki peediton ko nyaay dene kii bajaay ajay singh urf adityanath kii sarkaar vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ke daman main lagi he
 Randeep Surjewala said that Priyanka Gandhi's fault was that she wanted to meet the victims and wipe their tears
 surajevaala ne kaha ki peedit adivaasiyon ke gaanv oombha ko police chhavnee bana diya gaya he
 There is a ban on the arrival of anyone
 kya vahaan aatankwaadi or ugravadi hai?
 On 19 October 2017, the Adityanath government named the land of tribals as the main accused
 yogi sarkaar adivaasiyon kii jameen par kabja karwaanaa chaahati he
 He said that many firs were registered against the tribal farmer
 adivaasiyon ne jiladhikari ke paas aavedan kiya lekin koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 He said that if this is not the conspiracy of Adityanath government, then the truth is that Adityanath government is giving protection to criminals
 vah sonbhadra main aparaadhiyon ke saath khadi he
 We will take all possible steps to bring justice to the victims of the massacre
 surajevaala ne yah sawaal bhi kiya ki kya puure umbha gaanv (sonbhadra) ko police chhavnee main badal kar sach dabaa paaegi adityanath sarkaar? bhaajapa sarkaar ko priyanka gandhi se dar kyon lagata he?
 Significantly, Priyanka was stopped by the administration on Friday from going to Sonbhadra
 vah buudhvaar ko hue is samuhik hatyakand ke peedit pariwaron se milane ja raheen thi
 Priyanka sat on a dharna in protest of this move of the administration
 baad main unhen chunaar guest house le jaaya gaya
 On Saturday morning, some people from the victims' families reached there and met Priyanka
 pichley dinon sonbhadra main jameen vivaad main ek gram pradhan ne apane samarthakon ke saath milakar kathith rup se duusare paksh par golibari kii jisamen 10 logon kii maut ho gai or kai anya ghayal ho gaye
 (from input language) kabhi bollywood ke betaj badshaah kahe jane vaale shahrukh khan kii badshahath ab khatre main hai
 The falling collection of his films compared to other actors is a proof that Shah Rukh is no longer the same as the previous superstar
 yaa phir yun kahen ki tamaam aankade, darshakon kii pratikriyaayein or samikshakon kii samiksha is baat par hi muhar lagaati he ki shahrukh kaa staradam ab dhalaan kii ore he
 1
 nahin kar paa rahe kuch bhi nayashahrukhako samajhnaa hoga ki kisi jamaane ke 'rahul' (naam to suna hi hoga) ko sun-sun kar bor ho chuke darshak kuch nayaa chaahate hai
 Shahrukh is not able to do anything new in terms of story and acting
 ek ke baad ek aane vaali unki filmon se darshakon ko niraashaa hi haath lagi
 'ra-one', 'jab Tak Hai Jaan', 'chennai Express', 'happy New Year', 'dilwale' and now 'fan'
 ye list he shahrukh kii un filmon kii jinako lekar jabardast hip creat kii gai
 But the result of these films was before you
 is list main se sirf 'chennai express' ko chhod den (wo bhi sirf kamai ke maamle main) to baaki filmein kuch khaas nahin kar pain
 'chennai Express' may have brought relief for Shahrukh in terms of earning, but the film's story and his acting were rejected by both critics and audiences
 haal hi main relies hui film 'fain' se bhi shahrukh khan ko kaaphi ummiden thim, lekin box offis par film ummid ke mutabik kaarobaar nahin kar saki
 The film 'fan' made at a cost of 105 crores also could not fit into the hit category according to its cost
 2
 The earnings of the films falling continuously, the earnings of Shah Rukh's films are continuously falling
 shahrukh kii film 'chennai express' ne 227 karod, 'happy new year' ne 203 karod, 'dilavaale' ne maatr 135 karod kii kamai kii
 The 'fan' is running around with the elbows to join the 100 crore club
 vahiin bollywood main unke samaan kad vaale duusare stars kii filmein khub dhamal machaa rahi hai
 3
 kahin nahin badshaduniya bhar main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali bollywood kii 5 sheersh filmon main shahrukh kii kisi film kaa naam nahin he
 At the same time, two films of Aamir Khan and Salman Khan, seen as their biggest rivals in Bollywood, are included in this list
 ye hai duniyabar main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali bollywood kii 5 filmein:pike-740 karod,bajrangi bhaijan-626 karod,bahubali-600 karod,dhooma 3-542 karod,prem ratan dhan payo-431 karod rupye4
 Shah Rukh is not only getting beaten repeatedly by Aamir and Salman, but Akshay Kumar and Ranveer Singh are also cheering for Bollywood's throne
 akshay kumaar kii ek ke baad ek filmein hit sabit ho rahi hai
 At the same time, viewers and critics are also compelled to praise his performance
 film 'airlift' ne kamai ke saath-saath akshay ke abhinay ke liye bhi khub saraahna batori
 Actor Ranveer Singh, who won film by film acting, is also seen as a strong contender for Shah Rukh's throne
 film 'bajirao mastaani' main kiye gaye ranvir ke abhinay kii badaulat tamaam aalochak or sameekshak unka loha maanane lage hai
 5
 export kii raay main bhi shahrukhr nahin hai badshatrade enlist komal nahata ne ek bayaan main kaha ki 'fain' ke acha parform nahin kar paane kii ek hi vajah he ki audiyans ne hi film ko pasand nahin kiya
 At the same time, trade analyst Girish Johar tweeted that despite Shah Rukh's good acting in the film 'fan', the audience did not like the film because there was nothing exciting in it
 6
 It is seen that the pressure of the slipping ground has started to appear from Shah Rukh's gesture that he is under pressure due to the slipping ground of his stardom, which is not good for a king at all
 film 'fain' ke pramotion ke dauraan shahrukh ne kaha tha ki vah film kii safalataa ke liye idhar-udhar ke hatkande nahin apanaate
 But it was the result of a star's lost image that Shah Rukh retweeted the tweets of all the celebrities and fans congratulating him for his performance in the film
 yahi nahin shahrukh ne pehali baar fasebuk or twitor par video post kar apane phens ko film dekhne ke liye shukriya kaha
 The appeal to set the Twitter trend, etc
 The adoption of such tactics is a sign that along with the falling graph, King Khan's restlessness is increasing day by day
 7
 The new stars were also not ready to work together
 There was a time when every Bollywood star wanted to work with Shahrukh
 aae din kisi naa kisi intervyuu main koi naa koi star bol hi detaa tha ki wo shahrukh ke saath kaam karne kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 But now the time has changed
 shaayad shahrukh ke girte graph ko dekhte hue hi nae kalakaar bhi unhen bhav nahin de rahe
 Actually Shah Rukh Khan is going to remake the superhit film 'ittefaq'
 is film ke liye unki pehali pasand varun dhawan the, lekin varun ne samay nahin hone kaa bahaanaa banaakar khud ko kinare kar liya
 But call it the killing of time or the confidence of new artists that even the new girls are seen avoiding working with Shahrukh
 8
 The throne of Shah Rukh, who is calling himself the king of Bollywood, is restless, trying to save the throne
 isi kaa nateeja he ki wo baichaiyn hai
 They do not want to take any risk
 pehle khabaren thim ki id ke maukey par'sultan' or 'rais' kii bhidntahogi
 It was being said that Salman is adamant on releasing his film 'sultan' on Eid and Shah Rukh will also release 'raees' on the same day
 lekin relies se pehle hi 'rais' ne haar maan lee or film kii relies ko aage ke liye taal diya
 The decision to postpone the release of the film is also a sign that Shah Rukh is ready to do anything to save his throne
 unka star vaala atitude kahin gaayab ho gaya he or wo koi bhi samjhauta kar sakate hai
 9
 apane khaas bhi kar rahe aalochanabollywood ke bare main ek kahawat khub mashhoor he ki yahaan chadhate suraj ko hi salaam kiya jaataa he
 The meaning of this proverb must now be understood by Shahrukh
 kabhi shahrukh ko ghar ke sadsy jaisaa bataane vaali jaya bachchan ne unki film 'happy new year' ko bakawaas or 'sabase bevakoofana film' qaraar diya
 Not only this, on-screen Shah Rukh's best partner, Kajol had given a shock to Shah Rukh by talking about regretting his decision to work in the film 'dilwale'
 varun dhawan ek nahin balki do-do baar shahrukh ko ishaaron hi ishaaron main samajha chuke hai ki aapkaa staradam ab khatm ho chukaa he
 That is why he had earlier regretted being a part of the film 'dilwale' and now refused to act in his film
 apane vivaadit bayanon ko lekar aksar surkhiyon main rahane vaale ramgopal verma bhi shahrukh ke din ladane kaa ishaara kar chuke hai
 He warned Shah Rukh that Shah Rukh would soon lose his stardom to Salman Khan
 ye tamaam baaten hai jo shahrukh ke bollywood kaa badshaah hone ke daavon par sawaal khadaa karti hai
 The Income Tax Department has not found any evidence of income tax evasion against actress Katrin Kaif
 vigyapanon, videshi asinamenton or mehmaan kalakaar ke taur par kaam karne se hone vaali aay par sandigdh kar chori ke liye iskar vibhaag ne katrina caff ke ghar somvaar ko chhapemari kii thi
 The Income Tax Department investigated tax evasion in brand promotion, assignment abroad and private performances
 katrina ke upnagareey bandra ilaake ke guldev sagar imaarat kii saatvin manzil par sthit flats main chhapemari kii gai thi
 Apart from Katrina, Priyanka Chopra's house, Priyanka Chopra's secretary Chand Mishra's house, photographer Atul Kasbekar's residence and office were raided
 jabaki reshma shetty kii tallent management company ‘matrix’ main bhi chapa maaraa gaya tha kyonki isamen prabandhak ke taur par kaam karne vaali sandhya katrina ke liye bhi prabandhan kaa jimmaa sambhalati hai
 After the raid, it was reported that Katrina was found to have more wealth than known sources of income, a statement issued by Katrina's Chartered Accountant
 is bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘katrina caff ke awaas par iskar vibhaag kii taraf se chaanbin kii gai
 After this, Katrina had to face a lot of trouble due to the media reports that Katrina has disclosed a source of disproportionate assets which is worth crores
 is tarah kii koi baat nahin he or na hi unhone is tarah kii kisi sampati kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Katrina is fully cooperating with the Income Tax Department
 ’ Speaking in Sahitya Aaj Tak's 'hindi Hai Hum' session, poet Ashok Vajpayee said that the notion that language is lagging behind is wrong
 bhashaa nirantar banati or badhati rahati he
 Is dynamic
 gatishiltaa hi bhashaa ko aage lekar jaati he
 We are Hindi in the third session of Sahitya Mahakumbh organized by the country's number one news channel Aaj Tak - Is Hindi lagging behind in 21st century? Mridula Garg was present with Hindi writer and writer Ashok Vajpayee on the subject
 is maukey par bolte hue prasiddh mahila lekhak mridula garg ne kaha ki kitabon ko filmon se tulana karke dekhnaa galat he kyonki kitabon kaa sansar vyapak he or wo pathak kojigyaasa or kalpanadeti he
 Books are bigger and better than movies
 ise aage badhaate hue ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha ki sahitya ke sach adhure sach hote hai
 The reader completes this
 vahaan punya prasoon vaajapeyi ke marfat vah shrotaaon se rou-ba-rou hui
 Question- When it comes to language, is it a matter of social concern? Just like in the village it is about religion, in the city there is bigotry
 hamaare samaaj yaa phir bhashaa kii vidmbana dekhen to pate hai ki lekhak se bade sabhi hai
 When the reader or rasik reads it, he writes the truth of the author in its true form
 filmein aapako akelaa nahin chhodti
 Books leave you in a deep sea of fantasies
 hindi ke anchal main vidmbana he
 Middle class of other languages like Assamese and Bengali he pays full respect to his litterateurs
 hindi main 46 boliyaan hai
 Hindi simply binds them, and this math is not mine
 hindi yahaan ke anchal kii sampark bhashaa he
 The middle class of Hindi is the middle class running away from its language
 iske alaava hindi yahaan ke anchal main sampradayikta, jaateeyata or kshetreeyata main bhi fansi he
 Mridula Garg says that there are thousands of dialects even in China, but they have considered Mandarin as the top
 aasapaas baithe 25 chini alag-alag boliyon bol rahe hongemridula kahati hai ki secular shabd sabase daraavna or bhayankar he
 We have made religion scary and complicated
 dharm mere liye nijee maamla he
 i do not want to give any explanation on that
 ashok vaajapeyi- hindi ke anchal main palane vaale dhongi baba ke balaatkaar or hatya ke maamle main jab pakade jate hai to mujhe aadhyatmik sukh miltaa he
 a Shankaracharya was caught but he was left out due to lack of evidence
 meri maa mahaj 5veen paas thi lekin vaharamcharitamanas ke do pannapad kar uski puja kiya karti thi
 People should be taught the lesson that religion is a private matter
 loktantr main lok ko is baat se waakif karaane kii jarurat he
 Question: Literature should not cling to religion? Literature has always been against religion
 sahitya hameshaa se hi takaraata rahaa he
 You can see the literature of the last 50 years as a protest against religious, moral and political power
 wo baat alag he ki hamaari in chizon ko dekhne kii najar badi bhothari ho gai he
 Our job is to write
 kai baar isamen naatakeeyata aa jaati he
 Question- Is there any kind of pressure while writing that the film be made, the book become commercial
 mridula- mere saath aisa nahin hota
 My understanding is that the writer always uses the same words that are prevalent in society
 jaise ki boojadkhaane yaa rasoikhaane main jaaenge to vahaan keshabd istemaalhonge
 The author also coined the term many times
 pathak se apeksha rakhti he ki vah sau tarah ke sach padhe or apana sach chune
 Ashok Vajpayee - The writer has only language and truth
 lekhak bhi hameshaa khud par shaq karte hai
 True writers are those who doubt themselves
 mridula- bhashaa nahin pichad rahi he
 Words are always added to the language
 hindi pichad rahi he
 Sometimes we get caught up on obscenity
 jaise log tay karte hai ki koun se shabd ashleel hai
 Neither should they speak to women
 garbhavastha ke shuruaati samay main garbhpaat hone kaa khatra sabase adhik hota he isliye mahilaon ko is dauraan sabase adhik satark rahane kii jarurat hoti he
 Many times it happens that due to negligence, miscarriage happens
 vahiin kai baar garbhpaat natural hota he jisamen poshak dravya nikal baahar nikal jane se garbhpaat ho jaataa he
 But sometimes some factors are also responsible
 garbhpaat ke duusare kaaran:1
 It is necessary for the mother to be healthy during pregnancy
 agar maa kii tabiyat kharaab ho jaati he to iskaa sidhaa asar garbh main pal rahe bhrun par padataa he
 High blood pressure, diabetes are some of the conditions in which the fetus is damaged for loss
 2
 Mother's smoking during pregnancy can prove to be dangerous for the fetus
 dhumrapaan ke chalate bachche ko paryaapt maatra main oxigen nahin mil paati he
 In such a situation there is an increased risk of miscarriage
 3
 Taking too much stress can also prove dangerous for the unborn child
 agar maa khush rahati he to bachche par iskaa sakaraatmak asar padataa he
 4
 kai baar garbhvatee mahila kuch aisi chijen kha leti hai jo garbhavastha main khaanaa pratibandhit hota he
 Eating undercooked meat or stale food can prove dangerous for the woman and the unborn child
 5
 Apart from this, consuming alcohol can also harm the fetus
 maa ke sharir main folic acid kii kami se bhi bhrun ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 There is a kind of rivalry between Android users and iphone (ios) users
 yah khabar google or android yugers ke liye acchhee sabit ho sakati he
 According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partner (CRIP), Android is ahead of ios in terms of loyalty
 android yugers ioes ke mukaable apane zyada loyal hai
 This research agency has said that between 2015 and 2016, the loyalty of users for Android and ios smartphones has increased
 saal 2017 main android kii loylati rate 91 fisadi thi, jabaki ios kii 86 fisadi hi rahi
 This report said that Android users' loyalty to it has been steadily increasing since 2016, but it is still the highest
 2013 main ios yugers android ke mukaable zyada loyal the,lekin janvari 2016 se disambar 2017tak android ne ios ko peeche chhod diya he
 However, this agency has also said in its report that it should also be kept in mind that Android customers are more than ios
 isliye android se ios main switch karne karne ke maamle main android yugers zyada hai
 For loyalty testing, the agency removed a percentage of American customers who stayed on the old operating system despite upgrading their phones in 2017
 91 fisadi android oparating system ke saath hi bane rahe, jabaki 86 fisadi ios ke saath bane rahe
 China's new year is about to come and most companies are giving bonuses to their employees
 haalanki, china ke jiya praant main naanchang shahar main steel plant kii ek company kaa bonus baantne kaa andaaj sabase anokhaa he
 According to Shanghist, the steel plant made a mountain of cash from bank notes of about $ 44 million
 yah cash sabhi karmchaariyon ko bonus main diya janaa tha lekin company ne ye anokhaa tarika apanaaya
 The company distributed cash among its 5,000 employees
 har lucky amplayi ko saal ke ant main bonus ke taur par 62 lakh rupye mili
 One employee told Shanghisti, 'there is such a big bonus, i don't understand where to spend it
 'yah pehali baar nahin he jab kisi chini company ne bonus baantne ke liye ajab-gajab tarika apanaaya ho
 Last year, a company involved its employees in a cash grab based on a gameshow
 isamen ek simit samay ke bheetar cash ikaitha karne kaa mauka diya jaataa tha

 The state is preparing to make a historical human chain against social evil again on 21 January this year
 yah maanav shrinkhalaa bal vivaah or dahej pratha ke khilaaf hogi
 Earlier in the year 2017, Bihar had created a human chain showing similar solidarity against the evil like alcohol, in which more than four crore people joined and made Limca Book of Records
 isi baar phir aisa hi avasar he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been saying in every public meeting that dowry and child marriage is a social evil
 isse sabhi waakif bhi hai
 It is very important to erase it from the root
 nasha mukti ke baad ab bal vivaah or dahej pratha jaisi kuriti par kadi chot karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 We have about 39 percent child marriages here
 jo log bal vivaah gaanv-dehaat main karte hai, uskaa kaaran unki soch he
 Such people believe that when the child gets older, the dowry will be more
 lihaaja mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki bal vivaah or dahej pratha ke khilaaf shashakt abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 The campaign has been started on Bapu's birthday from 2 October 2017
 is babat kanoon to saal 1961 se hi ban gaya tha
 Despite this, the ill effects of the dowry system continue to grow
 bal vivaah main utani kami nahin aa rahi he, to aisi sthiti main ek shashakt abhiyaan chalaane kii jarurat he
 a recent survey found that 12 in the age group of 15 to 19 due to child marriage
 2 pratishat kishoriyaan maa ban gayi yaa phir garbhavati ho gayi
 While giving birth to children, the probability of death of girls below 15 years is five times more than that of women aged 20 years
 bal vivaahake dushprinaam sirf balikaon tak hi simit nahin he, balki agali peedi ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 The physical, mental and psychological development of girls is severely affected due to child marriage
 kam umr main garbhadhaaran karne ke kaaran maatayen aswasth or aviksit shishu ko janm detii hai
 Such children later fall prey to dwarfism and retardation
 antarrashtriya khaadya niti anusandhan santhaan ke prativedan ke anusaar bihar rajya main varsh 2006 se 2016 ke bich paanch varsh se kam aayu ke kareeb 40 pratishat bachche bounepan kaa shikaar hue hai
 Due to discrimination, the infant mortality rate of girls in the state is 46 percent and 31 percent of boys
 dahej pratha ek saamaajik kuriti he, jo kanuunan aparaadh hone ke baavjood samaaj main vyaapt he
 This practice has become more widespread over time
 saath hi samaaj ke sabhi virgon, visheshkar garib virgon, ko prabhavit kar rahi he
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau data published in the year 2015, Bihar ranks 26th nationally in the rate of female crime, but second in dowry death cases
 dahej mrityu ke maamalon main 2
 Bihar and Uttar Pradesh rank first with a rate of 3, while the national average rate is 1

 Manish reached this property dealer's house again every day
 unhen blackmel karne laga
 The talk went wrong and the argument started

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement related to the slogan 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' has revealed a big statement regarding 'vande Mataram' and the saffron flag
 sangh ke sheersh padaadhikari bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha he ki vastav main ‘vande maataram’ hi raashtragan he or bhagava jhande ko rashtriyadhvaj kahana bhi galat nahin hoga
 However, the Sangh also issued an explanation to this effect
 sangh ke pravaktaa dow
 Manmohan Vaidya issued an explanation on the statement of Bhaiyyaji Joshi, saying, 'the Sarkaryawah of the Sangh did not talk about changes in the national flag nor the national anthem
 unhone bas rajya or raashtra main antar batalaaya
 Bhaiyyaji Joshi said that the tricolor has the status of national flag in the Indian Republic, while the flag of flag is a symbol of the ancient civilization of the country
 'unhone aage kaha ki jan gana man rajya ke vichaar kaa suchak he, jabaki vande maataram hamaari sabhyataa kii pahchaan he
 In real sense, 'vande Mataram' is the national anthem: Bhaiyyaji Joshi Sangh's Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi said, 'jana Gana Mana is our national anthem in the present era
 iskaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 There is no reason for this to cause a second feeling
 ' unhone shuukravaar ko dinadayal upaadhyaay anusandhan santhaan main kaha ki samvidhan ke anusaar yah hamaara raashtragan he
 If anyone considers the real meaning then Vande Mataram is our national anthem
 donon geeton kaa ho baraabar sammanjoshi ne kaha ki 'jan gana man' kab likhaa gaya? ise kuch vakt pehle likhaa gaya tha lekin 'jan gana man' main raashtra ko dhyaan main rakhkar bhavanaaen vyakt kii gai hai
 He said, however, that the sentiments expressed in 'vande Mataram' underline the characteristic and texture of the nation
 donon geeton ke bich kaa antar he
 Both should be respected
 'bhagava dhvaj ko rashtradhvaj maananaa tirange kaa apmaan nahin'bhaiyaji joshi ne aage kaha ki tirangaa desh kaa rashtradhvaj he, lekin bhagava jhande ko bhi rashtriya dhvaj kahana galat nahin hoga
 He said, 'the tricolor was born in 1930, but before that there was no flag to identify India? It was brought as a counter to the Constitution, which considers its obligation towards the Constitution, it should respect the people and the tricolor
 lekin raashtra kii sankalpana main bhagave dhawj ko rashtradhvaj maananaa ye aaj ke tirange kaa apmaan nahin he
 'vande Mataram's major role in the freedom movement' Vande Mataram 'is a poem from the book' Anandamath 'written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay
