 Why can't we make these products with common technology and modest innovation? We will find the answer in the ranking of the World Bank, which the government is gasping to swallow
 189 deshon ke bich ranking main bharat kaa 130waan darja bharat main kaarobaari kathinata kaa adhuraa sach he
 For the whole truth, we have to see the ten parameters on which this ranking is made
 kaarobaar shuru karne kii suvidha main bharat kii ranking 155veen he, jo pakistan se bhi kharaab he
 India is followed by Gaza, West Bank, Libya etc
 in this ranking
 isi tarah bhawan nirmaan kii manjuuri main bharat kii ranking 185veen or tex main 172veen he
 We should ask the question, who faces trouble in starting a business? Inspector Raj, tax, electricity connection, who is difficult to take loan? Who needs the Ease of Doing Business, for small units that have the option of cheap imports, or for the hundred or two hundred companies with Make in India flags for which red carpets have been laid in every state? Even knowing that big companies will not invest in all the states, the Chief Minister is bowing down
 koi mukhyamantri choti companiyon ke liye koi nivesh mela lagaataa nahin dikhataa
 During the last two decades most of the investment of large companies in India has come in two types of sectors
 ek—jahaan prakritik sansaadhan kaa license milane kii suvidha he, jaise koyala, spectrum, khanij aadi
 Two - where competition is limited and there is a chance to take a larger share of the market through technology or heavy production capacity, such as automobiles, software, steel, cement, etc
 yakeenan, bharat ko bade nivesh chahie or mil bhi rahe hai lekin musiibat yah he ki baltiyaan, pataakhe, gubaare, khilone, bartan koun banayega or vah bhi aayaat se kam laagat par
 Some Ambani, Adani, Samsung have been making these
 bharat ke alag hisson main asankhya utpaadan kshamtaayen chahie jo bade paimaane par saamaanya takanic vaale utpaada bana saken or desh ke har chote-bade bazaar tak pahunchaa saken taaki 125 karod kii aabaadi apni saamaanya utpaadon or upbhog khapat ke liye aayaat par nirbhar na rahe
 Only small units can do this work because they have the facility of economical production of production at low cost and rapid innovation according to demand
 choti ikaiyaan aatmanirbharta or mahangaai par niyantran ke liye hi jaruri nahin hai balki badi ikaayiyon main badhate automation or robotics ke bich adhikansh rojgaar bhi yaheen se aane hai
 80 per cent of China's jobs are in small industries, ie the production of goods for which we pretended to boycott
 hamen is sach ko sweekaar karnaa hoga ki bharat main chote udyogon kii beemaari bahut badi ho chuki he
 India is the toughest country in the world for small traders, which is why most small entrepreneurs have become traders of imported goods or distributors of big companies
 hamen maananaa chahie ki mek in india hamen rojgaar or nivesh nahin de sakaa he or ej of duing bijness kaa paakhand keval chuninda badi companiyon tak simit rah gaya he
 If we have to fight cheap imports from China, then the whole fun of Make in India will have to change
 hamen china se chinada nahin balki siikhnaa hoga jo apni choti companiyon ko micromultinational main badal rahaa he
 25 years after liberalization, now India needs five hundred small domestic brands instead of ten big global brands, otherwise we will have to live with the inconsistency that the world's third largest economy can make missiles but we depend on China for firecrackers Huh

 Manmohan said, "I have discussed with Prime Minister Harper about not using Canadian soil to promote terrorism
" pradhanmantri ne mujhe bataaya ki aise kanoon hai, jinamein is sambandh main roak kaa praavdhaan he or vah prabhavi he, lekin mujhe vishwaas he ki pradhanmantri harper kii sarkaar tamaam gatividhiyon ke prati puri tarah jaagruk rahegi

 If someone has occupied your house or land, you can evacuate it without going to court
 is sambandh main supreme court ne apana faisla sunaaya he
 Judging in the case of Poonaram v Moti Ram, the apex court held that no person can unlawfully occupy the property of another
 agar koi kisi duusare kii property main aise kabja kar letaa he, to peedit paksh balpurvak khud hi kabja khaali kara saktaa he
 However, it is important that you own that property and it should be in your name ie you have the title of that property
 puna ram banaam moti ram maamle main supreme court ne kaha ki agar aapke paas property kaa tital he, to aap 12 saal baad bhi balpurvak apni property se kabja khaali kara sakate hai
 There is no need to sue the court for this
 haa agar property kaa tital aapke paas nahin or kabja ko 12 saal ho chuke hai, to aapako court main cese karnaa hoga
 The Specific Relief Act 1963 has been enacted for the legal proceedings of such cases
 property se gaiyr kanoonee kabja khaali karaane ke liye spacific relif act kii dhara 5 ke tahat praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 However, the dispute must be taken first in the dispute of the property, so that the occupant cannot construct nor sell it on that property
 spacific relif act kii dhara 5 ke mutabik agar koi property aapke naam he yani us property kaa tital aapke paas he or kisi ne us property par gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se kabja kar liya he, to use khaali karaane ke liye civil prakriya samhita (sipisi) ke tahat mukadmaa daayar karnaa hota he

 When it came to the ownership of that land, it was revealed that the land is occupied by a person named Moti Ram
 haalanki moti ram ke paas jameen ke koi kanoonee dastavej nahin the
 After this Poona Ram filed a court case to get possession of the land
 maamle main trial court ne puna ram ke paksh main faisla sunaaya or moti ram ko kabja khaali karne kaa aadesh diya
 After this Moti Ram appealed the case in Rajasthan High Court
 is maamle main sunwaayee karte hue hoicourt ne trial court ke faisle ko palat diya or moti ram ke kabje ko behaal kar diya
 Poona Ram then appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of Rajasthan High Court, on which the court ruled in favor of Poona Ram and said that the person possessing the title of the land can forcefully vacate the possession from the land
 is maamle main moti ram ne daleel di ki us jameen par uskaa 12 saal se zyada samay se kabja he
 Section 64 of the Limitation Act says that if someone occupies the land for more than 12 years, then it cannot be evacuated
 haalanki supreme court ne moti ram kii is daleel ko khaarij kar di
 The apex court said that this law is applicable in cases where the land is not owned by anyone, but the land that is owned by one and has the title of that land, then it can be forcefully evacuated even after 12 years

 Then that person asked another question, but who is my neighbor? Jesus said, at any time that needy and helpless person who is in front of you, he is your neighbor

 NEET ko is makasad se shuru kiya gaya tha ki medical collejon main daakhile kii ichha rakhane vaale chaatro par maansik or aarthik boj ko halkaa kiya ja sake
 Along with this, to prevent irregularities like capitation fees, it can be ensured that only qualified students get admission in medical colleges

 At the same time, the Chairman of Mulayam Singh Yadav Medical College of Meerut, Dr
 sarojini agarwal ne institute ke daakhilon ko lekar kisi tarah kii aniyamitata main shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he
 Dr
 sarojini agarwal ne india today se kaha, ‘main nahin jaanati ki aapaki sidi par kya he? maine use dekha nahin he
 But i know that the admission process in our medical college is completely transparent

 When India Today contacted Wasim Ahmed, associated with Era's Lucknow Medical College, on open camera, he denied any wrongdoing
 unhone kaha, ‘maine kabhi nahin kaha ki NEET ke jaruri score ke bina daakhila ho saktaa he
 This decision can be taken on the admission of DG Medical Education and the government itself
 ham daakhilon par kaise nirnay le sakate hai
 'wasim Ahmed claimed,' Everything happens from the DGME (director General of Medical Education)
 counselling, fees, documentation, sab kuch vahiin se hota he
 How can we do this? ham is tarah kii chizein nahin karte
 'minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey has said that if a medical college adopts wrong way, the government will take strict action against it
 yadi koi college aniyamitata karata he or ise sabit karne vaale pukhta saboot maujuud hai, to rajya sarkarein samuchit karrwai karengi
 If the Central Government receives such irregularities, it will recommend strict action against such colleges
 ’unhone aagaah kiya ki jo institute siten bechate paae jaaenge, wo apni manyata se haath dho sakate hai
 Ashwini Kumar Choubey said, 'I appeal to all the students and their parents not to fall for such colleges
 yadi rajya sarkaar karrwai kii sifarish karti he to centre sarkaar unki manyata radd kar sakati he
 Action can also be taken against those who enroll in wrong ways

 jarur padhein: mulaayam ke saamne muslim chunautiiske alaava unki chaar pariyojnaon main ek he chaar len kaa rajmarg, jo 44 jila mukhyalayon ko aapas main jodega; duusari pariyojna lakhanu metro kii he jo mashhoor i

 The sixth important project is of an international cricket stadium which Akhilesh shows with enthusiasm on the plane while returning to Lucknow the same evening, and in doing so, his eyes glow back
 yadav parivaar main satta kaa asantulaikhilesh ke liye jaruri he ki ye sabhi pariyojnaayen or saath hi duusare chhitput kaam is saal ke ant tak puure ho jaaen taaki uttar pradesh chunaav main unka laabh liya ja sake or unhen yadav parivaar ke duusare sadasyon par apana varchasv jataane kaa bhi mauka mil sake
 Most important in this family are his powerful ministers like 61-year-old Shivpal Singh Yadav, who has several departments under him
 akhilesh ke samaajawaadee party (sapa) kaa pradesh adhyaksh hone ke baavjood shivpal ko 2017 ke prachaar kaa prabharee banaaya gaya he jiske chalate chah saansadon or raajnneeti ke vibhinn paaydaanon par kam se kam 20 sadasyon vaale is parivaar main satta asantulan paidaa ho gaya he
 whether the campaign in-charge has more power than the Parvati president during the election, Shivpal smiles, "yes, it does

 It has hired election strategist Prashant Kishore
 akhilesh in tamaam andruni or bahari chunautiyon ke bichobich khadey hai
 The force of the Samajwadi Party with which they are taking the front, they have a weak grip on it and it is also surrounded by all-round enemies
 is chunavi maidan se satta virdohi dhundh lagaataar uth rahi he
 sp's future at stake: Not only is Akhilesh at stake in the next year's election, but also the future of the Samajwadi Party
 1990 main mukhyamantri ke bataur apane pehle kaarykaal main mulaayam ne ayodhya main babari masjid ko bachaakar musalamaanon ke hitaishi kii chhavi banaai or mandal andolan ke baad kii raajnneeti main ve pichde netaa ke rup main ubhare, jiske sahare unka ek vyapak janaadhar taiyaar hua tha
 Now his health is not very good, so the grip is also getting loose
 ab yah akhilesh ke jikvame rah gaya he ki ve apane paramparaagat vot bank ko kaise pakade rakhen or party ke aadhaar ko kaise vistaar den
 This was the reason that Mulayam made him Chief Minister in 2012 so that the transfer of power could be done easily
 mukhyamantri ke bataur akhilesh kaa pehla kaarykaal haalanki kanoon-vyavastha se jude vivaadon se hi ghira rahaa he, naukarshahon ne unhen darkinar kiya he, kyonki ve ab bhi unke pita ko hi asli mukhiya maanate hai or parivaar ke sadasyon ne bhi unhen baandhe rakhaa he
 Akhilesh has not yet emerged as a leader with a mass base to replace his father
 isaki aanshik vajah yah he ki khud mulaayam hi apni taraf se niyantran kii lagaam dhili nahin kar sake hai
 There is a fear that the SP, which has been in the role of the biggest regional power for two consecutive decades, will not be marginalized after five years of power and Akhilesh's political future will end forever
 paariwarik bandhanmukhyamantri ke bataur akhilesh ke kaamkaaj kaa vishleshan karne ke liye unki vishisht sthiti ko samajhnaa bahut jaruri he
 On the one hand there is his father, who often keeps his rein, on the other hand there are some family members who have direct access to power
 iske liye hamen yadav parivaar ko or gahare utar kar samajhnaa hoga
 The story that began three decades ago with Mulayam as a farmer and wrestler, from a student leader to his "netaji" for the backward states of UP, is now complicated by some brothers, nephews, cousins and daughters-in-law in recent years
 The family story has been transformed
 desh main aksar nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa zikr siyaasi samrajya ke bataur hota rahaa he lekin sonia-rahul-priyanka ke mukaable yadav khandaan zyada jatil or sanyukt he
 Many streams originate from the Yadav family
 One stream originates from Mulayam's elder brother Ratan Singh, who today comes to his grandson and Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, who is the youngest Yadav MP in Parliament
 duusari dhara mulaayam ke chote bhai abhaya ram yadav se shuru hoti he jo saifai ke ek swabhimani gwaala hai
 His son Dharmendra is MP from Badaun
 teesri dhara mulaayam ke pehle chachere bhai ram gopal yadav se nikalati he jo rajyasabha ke saansad hai or jinhen parivaar main ''professor" ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jinke bete akshay firozabad se saansad hai
 Then there is Mulayam's youngest brother Shivpal Singh Yadav who is his most trusted close
 ve vidhayak hai or unke bete aditya rajya sahakaari sangh ke mukhiya hai
 Akhilesh is himself the son of Mulayam Devi, Mulayam's first wife and his wife Dimple is an MP from Kannauj
 iske baad baari aati he pratik kii jo mulaayam kii duusari patni sadhana singh ke bete hai jabaki unki mahatvakankshi patni aparnaa 2017 main lakhanu (kaint) se vidhayak pratyaashee hai
 Amongst these important members are first, second and third cousins who hold different positions in party committees and other units
 shivpal eemaandaaree se kehete hai, ''kuch log apni mehnat kii fasal kaat rahe hai, kuch kii kismat acchhee he
 "on the condition of non-strength of Mulayam's clan," says another relative, "netaji is like a banyan tree and we are all thriving in his shadow
" " ve itani saraahna vaala vaakya isliye kah rahe hai kyonki unhen andaja he ki yah baatcheet kahaan tak ja sakati he
 The Yadav dynasty is more like a complex power structure than an ordinary tree
 aisa nahin he ki sabhi rishtedaaron-naatedaaron ke bich sambandh bahut achche hai
 Although there is no enmity in the open and the clan is always united against any external attack, but there are clashes inside
 parivaar main yah charchaa bhi khule rup main hoti he ki akhilesh ne mukhyamantri kaa pad apni kaabiliyat se arjeet kiya he yaa phir apane pita ke kaaran ve iskaa laabh uthaa rahe hai
 The fine contrast between "netaji", "ministerji" (shivpal) and "chief Minister" or "bhaiyya" in Saifai, the war of inheritance in the family, is evident from the fact that you are in this shining countryside In which part are you standing? kehane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uttaradhikaar kii jang khule main chal rahi he
 Akhilesh lived with Shivpal for many years in his childhood and the two have a father-son relationship
 iske baavjood yah sawaal ab tak ansulajhaa he ki donon main se koun mulaayam (jo ab aanshik rup se avkaash kii sthiti main aa chuke hai) kii dharti ke laal vaali viraasat par sachcha daawa kar saktaa he yaa phir parivaar main koi teesraa he jiskaa upyukt vaaris ke bataur ubharna abhi baaki he
 'I am not a socialist, not a Mulayamist: The reason for further complication of Amar Singhmale is the influence of Azam Khan, senior minister in the UP cabinet and the Muslim face of the party, because he himself is considered a law
 yahi haal siyaasi chaal main mahiramar sinhakaa he, jo 2010 main party se khadede jane se pehle tak mulaayam par acha-khaasaa prabhaav rakhte the or kisi tarah dobaaraa majboot hokar ubhare hai
 Amar Singh was present in Saifai at Mulayam's birthday celebrations last November
 unhone 2 april ko zee samooh ke maalik subhash chandra ke ghar par shivpal ke bete aditya kii shaadi ke resepshan kii mejabani kii thi
 Subsequently, on 17 May, the party supported his nomination to the Rajya Sabha
 is maukey par unka pehla bayaan hameshaa kii tarah bahut maujuun rahaa, ''main samaajawaadee nahin, mulaayamavaadi hum
 "akhilesh knows that success is achieved only slowly and one success makes way for another
 isi soch ke chalate beete 18 maheenon ke dauraan mukhyamantri ne apni chaal badali he
 He says, "the promotion speaks for itself
 use prachaarit karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 "not always though
 akhilesh 2012 main sapa ke yuva chehre ke rup main mayawati sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul ke kandhe par savaar hokar satta main aae the
 The tragedy of Uttar Pradesh is that any government of BSP (four governments after 1995) is known for its corruption and scandals, while every government of SP (four governments after 1989) was notorious for law and order related problems
 Huh
 akhilesh ne jab pehali baar kaman haath main lee, to kuch andeh jarur tha lekin ek ummid bhi thi ki ve rajkaaj kaa ek taaja or takanic pravan tarika akhriyaar karenge
 The youngest Chief Minister of the state (39 years at that time) started to feel helpless after a few days
 satta main aane ke hafte bhar baad hi akhilesh ne us faisle ko palat diya jiske anusaar upi constebulari ko uske grih jile yaa pados ke jile main tainaat nahin kiya janaa tha
 Due to this trend, caste-based police rule was established
 masalan, itawa or mainpuri ke aasapaas yadavon kaa raaj yaa mujffarnagar or meerut main jaaton kaa raaj
 Akhilesh gave up this policy mainly in the interest of the Yadavs and soon the Yadavas ruled over 800 police stations of the state
 ek varisht police afasar bataate hai, sangathit aparaadhon se nipatane vaali upi police kii do sabase prabhaavshaalee ikaiyaan vishesh kaary bal (estf) or aatankwaad nirodhi dasta (aties) nae shashan ke tahat niskriy ho gayi jiske chalate puraane aapraadhik girohon kaa dobaaraa ubhaar ho gaya
 Law and order began to decline rapidly throughout the year
 kaman sanbhaalane ke kuch maheenon ke bheetar hi upi sachivalay main yah charchaa hone lagi ki nae mukhyamantri nitigat charchaaon ke dauraan khud ko samet lete hai or aksar baithkon main apane smartphone par lage rahete hai
 He was rarely omnipotent in the office at the fifth floor of the all-powerful UP Secretariat and preferred to work from his official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg
 yahaan ve lagaataar sthaneey tivi channelon se mulaakaaten karte or apane pita ke bheje sthaneey netaaon se milte the, jinka koi chota-motaa kaam karwaanaa hota tha
 After seven o'clock in the evening it would be very difficult to meet him because he used to spend this time with his family and friends
 inamen adhiktar dost sthaneey kaarobaari the jinhen sapa ke andruni log akhilesh kii ''hai-halo brigade" ke naam se pukaarte hai or un par akhilesh ko jamini hakeekat se dur karne kaa dosha madhte hai
 Then he often started traveling abroad
 rajkaaj kaa adhikansh kaam mulaayam, unki vafaadaar iees afasar anita singh (jo ab bhi pradhan sachiv ke bataur akhilesh par kareebi nigaah rakhti hai),shivpal, ajam khan or ramgopal nipta rahe the
 There was a rift among the bureaucrats that India Today also mentioned in 2013 that there are five and a half chief ministers in the state — Akhilesh is half
 akhilesh harakat main tab aae jab 2014 ke aam chunaav main parivaar ke paanch sadasyon ko chhodkar party ke saare pratyaashee haar gaye
 The final count of the remaining three years of his tenure seemed to have begun
 pradhanmantri ke pad par modi ke shapath lene ke bamushkil do hafte baad 10 june, 2014 ko unhone vidhansabha ke tilak haul main rajya ke sabhi varisht afasaron ko talab kiya or kaha ki unhen unki karravaayiyon ke liye javabdeh hona padegaa
 He said clearly, "if you do not give results, you will be removed
" "vikaas kii chalakanoon-vyavastha samet kai masalon par kai baar unke pita or duusare rishtedaaron ko samajha paanaa mushkil hota tha, isliye akhilesh ne apni vikaas pariyojnaon par khud ko ekagra karne kaa nirnay liya
 Alok Ranjan, reputed as a working officer, immediately assumed the post of Chief Secretary
 isse unka kaam aasaan ho gaya
 Construction of Lucknow Metro was part of the manifesto of SP
 yah sitambar 2014 main shuru hua
 The lucknow-agra Expressway was not included in the manifesto but its foundation was laid in November 2014
 bheetar ke log bataate hai ki akhilesh kii kuch puraani dikkatein ab tak barkaraar hai
 Such as being lost on the phone during meetings, disappearing in the evening and succumbing to family pressure (mulayam has scolded him in public twice, once in 2014 and another in 2015)
 sachivalay ke afasar haalanki yah maanate hai ki ve badale hai—pehle ve kisi cheez kii parvaah nahin karte the lekin aaj ve kaaphi koshish kar rahe hai
 But as his favorite projects are taking shape, his confidence continues to grow
 akhilesh sweekaar karte hai, ''shaayad mujhe harakat main aane main kuch vakt lag gaya
 This state is very large and complex
 aapako kaam karaane ke liye sahi afasaron ko or sahi tareekon ko dhundhna hota he
 "the question is whether this sudden change will compensate for his initial inaction or is it too late? Akhilesh's development plan has two main thrusts - transportation and investment
 isamen swasthya seva or paryaton ko bhi joda gaya he
 a project management group in the state reviews the existing 21 projects weekly
 isamen kul 20,000 karod ru
 The grant of which has been raised in various ways
 lakhanu-agra expresve pariyojna puri tarah rajya sarkaar kii he jisaki laagat 8,775 karod ru
 And the length is 326 kilometers
 nijee-sarkari sahabhaagita kii koshishen kii gai hai lekin ant main sarkaar ne yah sadak sarkari kosh se banavaane kaa faisla kiya, jisamen sadak ke khul jane ke baad toll ke madhyam se nirmaan or rakrakhaav kaa ek hissaa nikaal lene kii gunjaaish bhi rakhi gai he
 Akhilesh asks in the aircraft, "you see that we are flying along the road?" Does this happen somewhere? "he says," We have made the highway absolutely straight
 yah do binduon ke bich sabase choti duuri he
 "the government acquired the land on a large scale without causing any dissatisfaction for the project
 iske liye kisaanon ko cirkil dar ke chaar guna tak bhugtan kiya gaya
 Akhilesh assured that at least clearances are required
 iske liye pariyojna ko un paryaavarniya kshetron se dur rakhaa gaya jinke liye kendriya manjuuri kii darkaar hoti he
 Etawah had a sanctuary of lions close to the original plan
 manjuuri se bachane ke liye akhilesh bataate hai ki sadak ko das kilometre dur kar diya gaya kyonki ''vah manjuuri nahin milti
 "work is also going on on another important project Lucknow Metro
 pehla charan 2,000 karod ru
 It will be completed this December
 kanpur, meerut, elahabaad or pradhanmantri modi ke chunaav kshetra varanasi main bhi metro network kii yojana banaai ja rahi he
 In a symbolic reference to Mayawati, he says, "things are going full speed now
" log dekh rahe hai ki chijen badal rahi hai
 We are not building our idols and are not building such parks which are locked
 ham sabhi kaa jivan behatar bana rahe hai
 “these projects are also having an impact
 sarkari aankade ke mutabik, rajya kii jidipi vruddhi dar (bazaar mulya par) 2014-15 main badhkar 6
 2 per cent, which is 4 in 2013-14
 9 fisadi thi
 Foreign investment is also increasing, but this state with 66 per cent farming is still backward in terms of education, housing and healthcare in rural areas
 masalan, shishu mrityu dar 2013 ke aankade ke mutabik, prati 1,000 prasav par 50 thi jabaki rashtriya ausat 40 kaa he
 Again a brand exercise is going on in which Akhilesh is being promoted as the visionary young Chief Minister
 print, radio or tivi ke vigyapanon main tamaam pariyojnaon kii baat ho rahi he or khaskar yah ki akhilesh puraa karne main lage hue hai
 Talk to any top official of UP government on the phone, you will hear the caller tone of "yuva Sochha, Yuva Josh", which is really a voice of youth energy of Akhilesh
 uttar pradesh kii junglekin abhi yah tay hona he ki agle vasant main uttar pradesh ko jeetne ke liye yah kaam kaaphi he yaa nahin, or akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar pehle 30 maheenon main kii gai galatiyon se peechha chhudaa paaegi yaa nahin
 Especially with those mistakes, due to which the perception of the Muslims was eroded and the law and order situation deteriorated
 vipaksh ne teen aadhaaron par akhilesh ko nishaanaa banane kaa faisla kiya he
 One was embodied in his initial image
 duusare, ve ghamandi or betkalluf netaa hai jinhen apane chaaron taraf maujuud chunautiyon kii koi parvaah nahin he
 Thirdly, they are so caught up in their family compulsions that they cannot do anything on their own
 14 april ko dalit mahapurush bi
 R
 ambedkar kii janmashti ke jalson main 60 varshiya mayawati garajin, ''us aadmi se logon kii bhalaai kii bhala kya ummid kar sakate hai jo saifai main melon par moti rakam phoonk rahaa he, videshon kii yatraaen kar rahaa he or afasaron ke saath match khilne main masaroof he
 Officers can win you in matches, not in elections
 " mayawati us dostana match kaa zikr kar rahi thim jo haal hi main siem ilevan or iees ilevan ke bich hua tha
 In response, Akhilesh refers to Mayawati as "bua" and challenges her to a fierce contest
 ve baar-baar jor dekar kehete hai ki ve bijepi se haath mila sakati hai
 Their intention behind this is to warn Muslim voters
 isi tarah purv sapa netaa raaj babbar, jo ab congress main hai or jinhone 2009 main kannauj ke loksabhaa upachunaav main dimple ko haraaya tha, akhilesh ke kaamkaaj ko ''10 main se jiro" number dete hai
 They allege that "they slept for four years and are now showing the speed of completing heavy projects in a year
" " mukhyamantri in aaropon ko haath ke ishaare se pare kar dete hai
 The electoral arithmetic of UP is not easy to understand, the electoral mathematics of Uttar Pradesh has always been very complicated
 2012 main jab sapa ne 403 main se 224 siten jitkar satta main dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii thi, tab voton main uski hissedari 29 fisadi thi, jabaki us vakt satta main hote hue mayawati ne 26 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 BJP could get only 15 per cent and Congress 12 per cent
 magar 2014 main naatakeey tabdili ai jab rajya main modi lahar ne bijepi kii jholii main 43 fisadi vot daal die or gaddinshin sapa 22 fisadi voton par simat gai
 The BSP, which garnered nearly 20 percent of the popular vote, could not even open its account
 is baar tikhaa chautarafa muqabla hone kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he, jisamen congress se kisi chamatkaar kii sabase kam ummid he
 The Dalit and OBC votes have traditionally been 20 per cent of the Dalit vote of Mayawati
 50 fisadi obisi voton main se ek hissaa mulaayam singh ke saath rahata he, jabaki baaki bispi or bijepi ke bich jhulate rahete hai
 Due to the mobilization of Hindus in 2014, a large part of these votes went to the BJP account
 haalanki voton kii is kism kii naatakeey golbandi shaayad dobaaraa mumkin na ho, magar bijepi maury ko party ke nae chehre ke taur par pesh karne se phayda milane kii ummid kar rahi he
 The real fight is of 19 per cent Muslim votes, who can either live in a dilemma between Mulayam and the Congress, or lump in Mayawati's lump
 2007 main bijepi ke khatre kaa mukaable karne ke liye ve thok main mayawati ke saath chale gaye the
 The coming together of Muslim and OBC votes, or the mobilization of Muslim and Dalit votes, is generally enough to bring the SP or BSP to power
 bijepi muslim voton ke mukaable ke liye obisi or oonchi jatiyon ko golband karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP will try to polarize by raising issues like love jihad, cow slaughter, ghar wapsi and Ram temple to conquer UP and claim its rule again in the state
 sapa ko muslim vot chhitakane kaa khatrahaalanki akhilesh ko sabase badi chunauti chaar baar mukhyamantri rah chuki mayawati se hi milane kii sambhaavna he, jinaki mulaayam ke saath adaavat jitani siyaasi he, utani hi nijee bhi he
 There is a risk of Muslim votes being sidelined by the SP, so there are many reasons
 inamen mujffarnagar ke dangon ko rokane main sarkaar kii naakaami, bihar main bijepi ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan se mulaayam kaa baahar aana or 1990 main ayodhya main dhaancha giraane ko betaab karsevakon par goli chalaane par pachhtaawaa mahasoos karne vaala unka bayaan bhi he, jinhen lekar musalamaanon main gussa he
 The 2017 election does not rest on Mulayam It may have seemed strange till a few years ago, but the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election neither rests on Mulayam nor the opposition
 iske bajaae vah is sawaal par tikaa he ki akhilesh apni nai chhavi logon ke gale utaarne or vikaas ke apane kaamon kaa shrey lene main kaamyaab ho pate hai yaa nahin
 This strategy echoes — or mimics — the 2007 Gujarat assembly elections, when Modi was projected as a figure of development
 lakhanu hawaii adde par utarate hi, kalidas maarg par apni agali baithak kaa rukh karte samay akhilesh kii gheraabandi kii ek jhalak milti he
 They live in a huge bungalow on Vikramaditya Marg at a far distance from here with Mulayam, Sadhana, Prateek and Aparna
 yahaan se do makaan chhodkar ajam khan kaa ghar he, teen makaan chhodkar samaajawaadee party kaa daftar he, or sadak paar karke thodaa saamne shivpal kaa nijee ghar he
 Anyone will feel that if Akhilesh wins his clan, it will have a direct impact on winning his province
 magar yahaan, is khadbadate siyaasi kadaahe main, iskaa ulataa matlab bhi ho saktaa he
 Akhilesh turns around to say one last thing just before he enters his office with a fast pace
 ve kehete hai, ''mere dimag main to bas agle kuch maheenon kaa
 
 
 The idea is to finish the work
 " phir kuch thaharkar baat puri karte hai, ''2017 apana khyaal khud rakh legaa

 All leftist parties are unanimous in fighting Kanhaiya from Begusarai
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue bihar sipiai ke mahasachiv satyanarayan singh ne kaha ki kanhaiya ko begusarai se chunaav ladvane ko lekar vampanthi dalon ke bich patna se dilli tak main ek raay ban chuki he
 Satyanarayan Singh said that the constituents of Kanhaiya Mahagathbandhan will be joint candidates of RJD, Congress, Hum and Left parties from Begusarai Lok Sabha seat
 ye puche jane par ki kya kanhaiya kii begusarai se ummidavaari par argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav se baat ho chuki he
 Regarding this, Satyanarayan Singh said that in principle Lalu has supported making Kanhaiya a candidate from Begusarai
 haalanki is ko lekar abhi koi aupchaarik baatcheet yaa ghoshnaa nahin hui he
 Begusarai seat is occupied by BJP, bjp's seat in Begusarai Lok Sabha seat

 yachikakarta ne kaha- aarope sabit hueis maamle main shikaayat karne vaale prashanth patel ne kaha ki yah puri tarah se saaf he, in 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd ho jaaegi
 He said, "I raised this matter in 2015, after looking at the whole case it seems that the membership of these mlas will be lost
" chunaav ayog apana faisla raashtrapati ke paas bhejega, jis par raashtrapati apni manjuuri denge
 "he further said," There is no scope for the membership of AAP mlas to escape, as the Chief Secretary of the Government of Delhi himself, in his affidavit to the Commission, admitted that the mlas were given facilities like ministers
 dilli main 7 vidhayak mantri ho sakate hai, lekin inhone 28 bana die
 "on the other hand, the central government objected to the Delhi High Court opposing the decision to appoint mlas as parliamentary secretaries and said that there could be only one parliamentary secretary in Delhi, which would be with the Chief Minister
 in vidhayakon ko yah pad dene kaa koi sanvaidhanik praavdhaan nahin he
 According to Article 102 (1) (A) and 191 (1) (A) of the constitution, if a member of Parliament or the Legislative Assembly holds any post of profit, then his membership can be admitted

 Avatar Singh pakistan kii khufia agency inter services intelegence (iesai) kii teror funding ke mastermind ke taur par giraftaar satna ke balram singh se dosti rakhana bajrang dal ke netaa ashish singh rathore ko bahut mahangaa padaa
 Rathore had the responsibility of head of the district cow protection of Satna
 vishwa hindu parishad ne rathore ko sanghathan se baahar karne kii jaankaree di he
 Bajrang Dal district co-ordinator Sachin Shukla said that on the basis of media reports, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad decided to take action against Rathore
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle ye maamla ujagar hone ke baad se hi bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad baikfoot par the
 Rathore had allegedly provided his account to Balaram
 media report ke mutabik, balram jin khaaton kaa istemaal karata tha, unke evaj main tayshuda rakam uplabdh karaata tha
 Along with this, he used to arrange for such expenses for such people going out

 Security checks of Delhi Metro's much-awaited and highest-speed airport line will be carried out on Friday and Saturday for the second time in the last three months
 iske baad aashaa he ki is line ko janata ke liye khol diya jayega
 Significantly, this 23 km long metro line between Connaught Place and Indira Gandhi International Airport has passed its three last dates
 lagbhag do hafton ke patr vyavhaar or spashtikaran ke baad metro rail suraksha ayukta (siemares) aar ke kardam ne dilli metro ko suchit kiya he ki vah shuukravaar or shanivaar ko is line kaa muyna karenge
 Mangu Singh, director of Delhi Metro, said, "the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety has agreed to inspect this line on January 7 and 8
 ’’ yah puche jane par ki kya siemares ne is maamle main or zyada spashtikaran maange hai to singh ne ise nakaar diya
 Delhi is suffocated due to the pollution of dissolved pollution in the climate
 dilli ke bascindia taaja or saaf hawa ke liye taras rahe hai
 In such a situation, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has studied from IIT, claims that he has an immediate cure for this problem of pollution of Delhi
 is ilaaj se hawa main ghule jahrile pradooshnakaari tatv hat jaaenge or dillivaasiyon ko tatkaal raahat mil jaaegi
 This 'panacea' treatment of Kejriwal is to spray water through helicopters
 jab aisa ‘sateek samaadhaan’ maujuud he to har koi sawaal kar rahaa he ki is par amal karne main phir deree kyon ho rahi he?aaie jaanate hai ki visheshgy is bare main kya kehete hai? pehali baat ye ki visheshgy ekamat hai ki pradooshan dur karne ke liye helicopter se pani chhidakane kaa vichaar puri tarah avyaavhaarik he
 Professor Mukesh Khare of IIT Delhi has been working on the subject of urban air pollution for years
 unka kahana he ki agar ise aajamaaya jaataa he to ye paise or pani kii baari barbaadi ke sivaa kuch nahin hoga
 Professor Khare says, 'nowhere in the world is this method used to remove pollution
 helicopterse chhidaka jane vaala pani jaldi suukh jayega or kuch hi ghanton main vikat sthiti par laut aaenge
 Yes, spraying water from a helicopter is often used to extinguish a fire, but it is limited to a small area
 1500 varg kilometre kshetra tak faile mahanagar main helicopters se pani chhidakane kaa vichaar haasyaaspad he
 Charan Singh, senior scientist of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), also dismisses this idea outright
 charan singh kaa kahana he, ‘dilli main jahrili dhundh punjab or pakistan se aa rahi he
 Due to seasonal conditions, it is standing in the sky of Delhi
 agar aap ise helicopter se pani ke chhidkaav se dur karne kii koshish karenge to ye sthiti thodi der baad hi laut aegi
 EPCA (environmental Pollution Control Authority) chairman Bhure Lal laughed on the idea that it was related to politics, not pollution
 dilli ke kharaab halaat se nipatane ke liye samaadhaan sujhane ke liye jor die jane par bhure laal ne kaha, paryaavaran main pradooshan kii jimmedaar dhul se nipatane se pehle inke strot ko jaananaa jaruri he
 For example, spraying water with a tanker is a good way to stop the dust blowing through the raw paths
 ye zyada prabhavi or kam kharchila he
 On spraying water with a helicopter, how will you ensure that it will fall only on the raw soil paths? What will we get by pouring millions of liters of water on the roads? ”the well-known environmentalist, Sunita Narayan, sarcastically said at the thought of spraying water from helicopters,“ This is not my idea and i do not know if any country has used it
 lekin dilli sarkaar ke paas kaaphi budhimaan log hai, aise main ve behatar jaanate honge
 Sunita Narayan said with a smile, 'everyone knows that a lot of wind and dust blows from the helicopter
 ’centre for science and enwyranment ke shodhakarta polash mukherjee ek buniyadi sawaal ke jariye helicopter se pani chhidakane ke vichaar kii hawa nikaalte dikhaai die
 Mukherjee said, where are the water? In a big city like Delhi, millions of liters of water will be needed for spraying water by helicopter
 kya dilli or aasapaas iske liye pani uplabdh he? kya ham pine yogya pani kaa istemaal karenge jisaki pehle se hi killat he
 Mukherjee pointed out that when a tanker sprinkled 25000 liters of water, it covered an area of just a few kilometers
 helicopter se pani chhidakane kaa matlab phir samajha ja saktaa he
 If spraying water from a helicopter is not practical, can artificial rain through cloud seeding solve this problem? Answer to this question, Prof
 mukesh khare ne aise diya- ‘cloud seading kam se kam vaigyanik drushti se behatar vikalp he
 But the expenditure on it makes it out of reach
 akaash main nami ko ekatra karne ke liye silver iodide jaise rasayanon kii jarurat hogi jo bahut zyada mahange hai
 China uses this method, but whether we can afford such a huge expenditure on a large scale, this is a big question
 ’IMD se jude charan singh cloud seading ko lekar kehete hai ki is vakt ye tarika aajamaane se bhi kritrim barish karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 'cloud seeding', says Charan Singh, means condensing moisture in the air with the help of chemicals to allow for artificial rain
 lekin maujuuda haalat main hawa main itani nami nahin he ki usase barish karai ja sake
 'when asked whether there is no moisture in the fog around us, Charan Singh said, all this moisture is just confined to the surface of the earth
 cloud seading ko kaamyaab banane ke liye dharti se 3 se 7 kilometre upar aasmaan kii ore nami honi chahie
 At this time the air is very dry, this is what happens in winter

 jasoos banane ke liye aap main or bhi kai chijen honi chahie
 Although there are very few women in this field, but if you have these 7 characteristics, then you too can become a good detective
 1
 To be a good actor, the first condition for a good detective is that he should come to play different characters according to the case
 yani acting bhiaani chahie
 Rajni Pandit, considered India's first female detective, told in an interview how she played characters ranging from beggars to domestic maids to solve her case
 2
 Experts in Technology For a good detective, it is very important that he has good knowledge of technology
 jaise ki agar mobile se delit data nikaalnaa ho yaa kisi desktop se delit pikchars ko ristor karnaa ho to khud kar saken
 Because taking the help of someone else runs the risk of breach of privacy
 3
 With the hidden camera comes the art of good photography, you cannot do it in front of anyone
 aapako har baat chhipaani hoti he
 Obviously, you cannot take a photo directly from a camera
 aise main hiden camere, jo mobile, aapke purse yaa aapaki suut ke batan main main ho sakate hai, se photography karte aani chahie 
 4
 legal pahalu bhi pataa hoek achche privet jasoos ke liye bahut jaruri he ki use sabhi aavashyak kanoonee pahaluon ke bare main pataa ho
 Where can a private detective go, what cases can be investigated, etc
 use yah bhi pataa hona chahie ki vah jis cese kii padtaal kar rahaa he, uskaa sambandh rashtriya suraksha se jude kisi maamle se to nahin he? yaa jisaki pikchar le rahaa he yaa jiskaa computer hack kar rahe hai, usase kuch legal ishyu to nahin honge
 It will be known only when it is aware of the entire legal aspects
 5
 One of the most important things for a private detective is that he should be an expert in forensics
 jaisaa ki ek intervyuu main senior detective ramesh madan bhi kehete hai ki jasusi ke liye agar aapke paas forencik kii degree yaa nolej hogi to aapako yah samaj main aayega ki criminals ke khilaaf kis tarah ke saboot ekatra karne hai
 6
 creative hona chahieek acha privet jasoos vahi ban saktaa he, jo bahut hi creative ho
 Creativity is required at every step in this field
 agar kisi kaa peechha karnaa he to is tarah se karnaa hoga ki kisi ko bhi yah shaq na ho
 If someone wants to ask something, then the questions have to be framed in such a way that you get what you want, and do not even suspect that you are spying on her
 7
 Be courageous, but not adventurous For a detective, it is important to understand the difference between courageous and adventurous
 saahsee hona yaa kisi tarah kaa dar nahin hona, ek jasoos ke liye anivaary gun he
 But he should not be adventurous
 kyonki filmi jasoos or real life ke jasoos main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar hota he
 Going inside a tall building's window will be called audacity, not espionage
 kya sikh sakate hai detective didi se?isi hafte 9 disambar se raat 8 baje ji tivi par detective didi serial telecast ho rahaa he
 It will telecast every week on Saturday and Sunday
 yah ek yang ladki kii kahani he, jo jasoos banakar kai aapraadhik maamalon ko solve karnaa chaahati he
 # Detective Didi Special Agent based in the capital Delhi follows the life of Bhim Singh Bhullar and Private Detective Bunty
 bhim jahaan dilli krime branch kaa ek mazaakia afasar he, jo apni jaanch bilkul niyam-kaayade main rahakar karata he
 While Bunty takes the case into his own hands, he has no confidence in the capabilities of the police
 cese ko koun pehle hal karata he or aparaadhiyon ko koun jail pehle bhejtaa he, ek ladkaa or ladki jo ki saath nahin khadey ho sakate, kaante kii ladaai main ulajhate hai or kai mahatvapurn cese hal karte hai
 Expert in their respective work, both of them take completely different methods in solving similar cases, but when they work together despite their differences, they appear to solve the case successfully

 laal bharose lalu
 That is, the politics of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Prasad Yadav is now revolving around his Lal Tejashwi
 lalu apane bete tejasvi ko launch karne ja rahe hai
 This is not the first time that a leader is handing over his political legacy into the hands of his children
 siyasat main santanwaad kii parampara kaaphi puraani rahi he or kareeb-kareeb desh ke har soobe main netaaon kii puri fouj maujuud he, jinhone apni santan ko siyaasi viraasat saunpi he yaa phir saunpane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Lalu is going to make his younger son Tejashwi his successor
 ve unhen apni siyasat kii viraasat saunpane ja rahe hai
 Tejashwi will be launched on Wednesday during Parivartan rally in Patna
 darasal, lalu kii najar 2015 main hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav par he or ummiden yuva votaron par tiki hai
 In such a situation, Lalu is feeling that the stunning trump card can be proved
 gandhi parivaar, thakare parivaar or mulaayam parivaar kii tarah hi lalu yadav kaa uttaradhikari bhi parivaar se hi aa rahaa he
 Lalu is going to hand over his political legacy to his younger son Tejashwi
 lalu kii planning he ki 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak tejasvi upi main akhilesh yadav kii tarah party kaa cheharaa ban jaae
 RJD President Lalu Yadav says, "whether Akhilesh or Rahul, whoever they are, children of politicians will do the same
 kaam karegaa, mehnat karegaa to aage badhegaa hi
 'tejashwi Yadav, who landed in the field of politics from the cricket field, is currently 23 years old, perhaps that's why he has played the youth card for the first time
 tejasvi yadav agle chunaav main yuvaaon kii hissedari badhaane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Tejashwi Yadav says, 'laluji said that in the coming assembly we will give 40 to 50 percent tickets to the youth, irrespective of caste, religion, who will be hardworking, who believes in social service, we will discuss and test it
 Will give tickets 'lalu prasad ke mutabik, 'party main jitne bhi netaa hai unke rishtedaar party main rahete hai
 The party that consists of family members is loyal to it
 ab meraa betaa he, beti he yaa patni to ye log aresas yaa bijepi kaa gungan to nahin karenge
 They will increase their party, support the party
 'parivaar kii siyasat ke paksh main lalu prasad yadav jo bhi daleel den duusari partiyaan bhi unki parivartan raily kaa makasad samaj rahi hai
 That's why Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says this is not a Parivartan rally, it is a leadership Parivartan rally
 90 ke dashak main jab lalu prasad yadav kii bihar main sarkaar thi to us vakt sankat aane par unhone kaman apni patni rabari devi ko saunp di thi, lekin ab shaayad samay badal chukaa he
 There is talk of youth everywhere, there are talks of development, that is why they are trying to give a new face to the party as their son
 chote bete tejasvi ko launch karne ke liye lalu ne joardaar taiyaariyaan kii hai
 And Lalu's family is taking care of the preparations themselves
 raily main bheed jamaa karne ke liye bihar ke kone-kone se 13 trainen book kii gai hai, jisapar kareeb dedh karod rupee kharch kiye gaye hai
 The second generation of Lalu is entering politics
 lekin donon pidiyon main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he
 On one side there is Lalu who calls people, scolds and on the other side he is very calm and calm with a gentle nature
 ek taraf hai theth, ganwai andaaj main logon ko lubhaane vaale lalu to duusari ore hai takneekee or soshal media ko apana mantra bataane vaale tejasvi
 In such a situation, the question is whether Lalu wants to remove his party from the old style and give a modern look
 bihar main lalu parivaar kii duusari peedi siyasat main utar hi he
 The land has been prepared, the stage is also ready
 lalu ne may kaa manapsand maheenaa bhi chunaa he
 Most of Lalu's successful rallies have been in the month of May, perhaps because of this, he chose this month for his son too
 lalu yadav or tejasvi yadav kii agar tulana karen to bahut kam aisi cheez milengi jo ek jaisi hon
 For example, Lalu Yadav entered politics from student politics, while Tejashwi inherited politics
 lalu patna vishvavidhyalay ke adhyaksh rahe, vahiin tejasvi chaatr raajnneeti ke bajaay cricket ke maidan main kismat aajamaate rahe
 Lalu's role model is Jayaprakash Narayan, while Tejashwi is following in the path of Rahul Gandhi
 immergency main lalu yadav ne laathiyaan khain, jail gaye to duusari taraf tejasvi ne band kamaron main siyasat kaa paath padhaa
 While Lalu Yadav talks typical and native things, the stunning new generation is telling his mantra to computers and social media
 lalu se apni alag soch ko tejasvi chipa bhi nahin rahe hai
 He says, 'obviously, there may be a difference in ideology between us and Lalu Yadav
 matlab aaj jis tarah kaa generation gap he, aap iti ko dekh lijie, aaj kitna advance ho gaya he
 In those days there was neither mobile phone nor laptop, so there was not much information
 aaj ke generation ke paas kam time he
 The role of social media is increasing, so it is our endeavor to reach more and more youth through social media
 'apane raajnneetik viraasat ke taur par lalu yadav ne apane chote bete tejasvi ko aage kar diya he, magar logon se milane kaa andaaj donon kaa bilkul alag he
 While Lalu is known to scold and call activists, Tejashwi's face is calm and gentle
 aise main tejasvi kaa ye andaaj argedy ko kitna raas aata he ye aane vaala vakt tay karegaa
 Lalu Prasad Yadav also likes this different style of his son
 unka kahana he, 'tejasvi kaa andaaj alag he har aadmi kaa apana andaaj mizaaj hota he
 This boy is calm, our children are both calm and gracious
 'raajnneeti main parivaarwaad par bhi tejasvi kii raay bebaak he or wo ise galat nahin maanate
 Tejaswi says, 'if you look from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every elder leader has sons in politics
 phir chaahe umr abdulla hon, akhileshji hon, rahulji hon, yaa jaganmohan reddy hon yaa karunanidhi ke bachche hon; sabane acha kiya he
 There are many leaders who have not been able to be as successful, but all this happens in the hands of the public, the public moves forward what will work
 'kul milakar lalu kaa ye laal party ko puraane taur-tareekon se nikaalnaa chahta he
 He is preparing to connect Lalu's lantern to the computer, the mission is clear, Mission 2015

 Former Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha said that India could have taken a different route from the G-4 and that it does not require him to pursue the matter with as much vigor as it is currently pushing
 sinha ne kaha ki modi ne ji-4 kii upie kii niti par bharosa kar 'galati' kii he
 He also said that it is a different thing to join hands with developing countries and it is a different thing to include two developed countries Germany and Japan in this group

 Sinha said that Modi had made a 'mistake' by relying on the UPA policy of the G4
 unhone saath hi kaha ki vikasshil deshon ke saath haath milaanaa ek alag baat he or do viksit deshon germany or japan ko is samooh main shaamil karnaa ek alag baat he
 Asked whether Modi should have opted for permanent membership instead of the one adopted by the previous Manmohan Singh government, Sinha said, "yes, i agree
" jitna adhik ham ji-4 ke saath ekajutata dikhaaenge, utana hi adhik sthaayee sadasyon ko shaamil karne kaa virodh hoga or sambhaavnaaen adhik ksheen hoti jaaengi
 The comments yashavanth sinha ne india today tivi par karan thapar ke kaarykram main yah bhi kaha ki aatankwaadi samooh iesas ke khilaaf vaishvik gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hokar or iran ke parmaanu kaarykram par lagaam lagane main america tathaa pi 5 plus 1 samooh main shaamil nahin hokar bharat ne galati kii he
 He said, as far as ISIS is concerned, India should have taken a front-line alliance to combat it globally and not leave it only to Arab countries

" ve hai pranab mukherjee or manmohan singh
 "ever since Mukherjee vacated the number two position, Pawar remained silent
 ensipi pramukh ko ummid thi ki unhen manmohan singh ke bagal vaali kursi milegi
 But in the cabinet meeting held on 12 July, the honor was given to Antony
 antni kabhi pavaar ke maatahat the, jab donon congress (es) main hua karte the
 The Congress says that it is difficult for it to give any ally in place of number two
 ensipi ne apni naaraazgi ko chupaaya nahin tha, lekin pradhanmantri ko yah samajhane main 7 din lag gaye ki kuch gambhir galati hui he
 On the evening of 19 July, his colleagues said that both the NCP ministers - Pawar and Patel - had not agreed to attend the cabinet meeting despite being in Delhi
 manmohan ne cabinet sachiv ko anya mantriyon ko yah bataane ko kaha ki ve baithak main der se aaenge or unhone phone par pavaar se baat kii
 Later that evening Pawar went to 7 race courses and handed a letter to Manmohan Singh
 isamen unhone bas yahi likhaa ki ensipi ek choti party he, isliye use upie main zyada kad yaa sammaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, they will now want to spend their time in party work
 ek ensipi netaa ne kaha, ''yah cabinet se istipha dene kii peshkash thi
 The next morning Pawar met Sonia
 unhone unase kaha ki congress ek samaveshi sarkaar nahin chalaa rahi
 He cited the example of NDA in which a chairman was appointed as well as a convenor
 bhaajapa netaa (laalkrishna adwani) endie ke chairman the, to sahyogi dal ke ek netaa (pehle george furnandis or phir sharad yadav) uske sanyojak
 Pawar also raised the issue that no coordination committee has been formed since the Left Parties were ousted from UPA-1
 ensipi ke sutron ne bataaya, ''sonia ne unki baat dhairyapurvak suni or kaha ki ve sthiti ko thik karne kaa prayaas karengi
 He also said that the government would be weak due to differences in views
 ''congress kii pratikriya kaa intjaar karne ke dauraan hi ensipi ne kuch sahyogi dalon kii madad se apana palada baari kar liya
 On 21-22 July, Mamata Banerjee called Pawar from Kolkata, while Patel went to see Uddhav Thackeray, admitted to a hospital in Mumbai
 uddhav or unke chachere bhai raaj thakare ke bich sulah kii bhi charchaa hone lagi
 This will only strengthen the anti-congress forces

 "we don't do number 2 politics," says Tripathi
 ham keval number ek main yakeen rakhte hai
 When she met Sonia Patel at the Tea Party held in Parliament on 23 July to bid farewell to former President Pratibha Patil, she cheered him and said, "do something cheerful"
 '' unke bagal main baithi bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne yah sunakar hansate hue kaha, ''prafull kuch mat karo
 "CPI leader Sitaram Yechury also joined in this laughter and joke and he said," Make Praful happy
 '' patel ne inke jawaab main talkh lahaze main kaha, ''pehle aap sab dyside (tay) karo
 "pawar is the marathon runner of politics
 ve agle aam chunaav ke liye chaalen chal rahe hai
 When Narasimha Rao became Prime Minister in 1991, Chandrashekhar told the disappointed Pawar that the Marathas never ruled Delhi
 pavaar ise galat sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 They are hopeful that they can become the main leaders of a non-congress, non-bjp coalition that will garner enough seats to form a national government without cooperation from outside parties or without their support
 haalanki, ensipi ne vidroh ke liye dikhaane kaa majamoon sankhya ko nahin balki sarkaar kii gunvattta ko banaaya he
 Patel says, "the central government is not working as per our expectations and our things are not being taken into consideration
" maharashtra sarkaar ke maamle main bhi yahi sach he
 With this mismanagement with allies, the Congress may face defeat in another major state

 Prithviraj Chavan is creating new problems for NCP in Maharashtra every day
 unhone apane mukhyamantri banane se pehle hi mantriyon ke vibhaagon kaa bantwaaraa tay ho jane par saarvajanik taur par khij jaahir kii thi
 Most of the powerful ministries of the state like Home, Finance, Energy, Water Resources, Rural Development, Public Works and Tribal Development are with NCP
 november, 2010 main kaarybhaar grahan karne ke kuch samay baad hi unhone kaha tha ki congress is gathbandhan sarkaar kii badi party he, isliye use vitt or grih mantralay milanaa chahie
 In October 2011, he cleared the criminal case against Lavasa City for violation of environmental regulations
 pune ke paas ek pahari par bana yah shahar pavaar kii hi sankalpana he
 The matter is currently pending in the sessions court of Pune
 satta par pakad rakhane ke liye ensipi kii apni vajahen hai
 In May last year, the Reserve Bank dissolved the board of directors of the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank
 is bank par pichley 17 saal se sharad pavaar ke bhattije or rajya ke up-mukhyamantri ajit pavaar kaa niyantran rahaa he
 Chavan immediately appointed his selected administrators to replace the dissolved board to run the bank
 emessi bank jile ke anya bainkon ko fund detaa he taaki ve kisaanon ko karj de saken
 An investigation conducted by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) revealed that most of the loans by these banks were given to cooperative sugar mills and spinning mills over which NCP leaders have direct control
 emessi bank par se niyantran khone se ensipi ko mushkil aa sakati he kyonki uske paas apane mukhya aadhaar pashchimi maharashtra ke ganna utpaadak kisaanon ko karj dilaane ke liye koi rasta nahin rah jayega
 The last thing to provoke the NCP was Chavan's announcement on 4 May that he would publish a white paper on the state's expenditure on irrigation in the last 10 years
 march main jari rajya ke vaarshik aarthik survey ke mutabik pichley 10 saal main rajya sarkaron dwaara 70,000 karod ru
 Despite spending, only 0 in irrigated areas
 1 fisadi kii vruddhi kii ja saki he
 Ajit Pawar has been the state's water resources minister between 1999 and 2010, so Chavan's announcement was a big blow to the NCP
 maujuuda jal sansaadhan mantri ensipi ke sunil tatakare kaa daawa he ki pichley dashak main rajya ke sinchit kshetra main 0
 Not 1 per cent but 5
 5 fisadi kii badhat hui he
 Ajit Pawar published in Economic Survey Report
 1 fisadi ke aankade ko 'chapai kii galati' bataate hai, jiske jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki shwetapatr se sabhi galtiyaan dur ho jaaengi or sach saamne aayega
 Chavan also has the Urban Development Ministry
 apane puvavarti ashok chavaan kii adarsh socity ghotaale kii vajah se satta chhin jane ko dekhte hue ve shuru main nai pariyojnaon ko manjuuri dene se bachate rahe
 He had asked the then Municipal Corporation Commissioner of Mumbai Subodh Kumar to formulate a strict policy regarding new construction
 kumaar ne kisi bhi aagaamee houseing project ko tab tak manjuuri nahin di, jab tak ki is saal janvari main nai niti nahin ban gai
 This enraged the NCP supporter builder lobby
 ensipi ke liye raahat pahunchane vaali baat yah he ki prithviraj chavaan congress main bhi utane hi alokapriy ho rahe hai
 42 of the state's 82 mlas have written to State Congress chief Manikrao Thakre and state in-charge Mohan Prakash in June criticizing the Chief Minister's functioning
 bina tithi vaale is patr ko pavaar ke vidroh ke bich main hi 24 july ko media ko li kiya gaya

 ke
 Prithviraj Chavan, who is considered as Antony, says that he will only approve such proposals which are of public interest
 unhone aisa computericed system taiyaar kiya he jisamen vidhayakon dwaara kiye gaye sabhi anurodh seve kiye rahete hai, kyonki zyaadaatar vidhayak vikaas ke project par baat karne nahin balki kisi ke vyaktigat project ko manjuuri dilaane ke anurodh lekar unke paas aate hai
 According to a close friend of Prithviraj Chavan, the Chief Minister suspects that such a request involves some money transaction, so they refrain from approving it
 saarvajanik taur par to ensipi yahi kahati he ki usne kabhi bhi prithviraj chavaan ko hataane kii maang nahin kii he
 Patel says, "we have never insisted on changing leadership in Maharashtra or making any special person as the Chief Minister
" '' asal main unhen aisa karne kii jarurat hi nahin he kyonki khud congress ke vidhayak chavaan ko gherne main lage hue hai
 Former chief ministers Ashok Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Sushil Kumar Shinde have complained that the chief minister is doing nothing to protect them in the Adarsh scam case
 congress ko dhire-dhire yah abhas ho rahaa he ki uskaa mukhya vipaksh to uske bheetar hi he
 How weak is the Manmohan government that the party of nine mps scares the 206 mps of Congress! whatsap par ek aisa video viral ho rahaa he jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki yogi sarkaar kii upi police ne akhilesh yadav ke saath bura suluk kiya he
 Let's know what is the truth of this video
 
 
 darasal whatsap par ghoomane vaale tamaam 'aaj kaa gyaan' or 'aaj kaa suvichaar' jaisaa hi ye video bhi 'farji he'
 Actually, what Akhilesh Yadav sees in the video is correct
 police se unki munhjhaunsi bahes bhi dikh rahi he
 But this police does not belong to the Yogi government, but to the Maya government
 pradesh main sapa sarkaar banane se pehle yani 2011 main jab mayawati mukhyamantri thim, tab kaa video he
 The true story behind the video was the historic day of March 9, 2011
 state main bahan mayawati kaa raaj tha
 In such a situation, thousands of people from Ambedkar Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Etah and all the districts reached Lucknow and were protesting without their permission
 sawaal vahi lau and order kaa tha
 For the past two days, the then SP supremo Mulayam Singhyadhav was under house arrest
 vahaan pradarshan main hissaa lene dilli se lakhanu pahunche akhilesh yadav
 Police had caught Amausi when he arrived at the airport
 vahaan badi bakajhak hui or akhilesh yadav arest ho gaye
 After that there were mass demonstrations across the state
 in pradarshnon ke dauraan 3 hajaar se zyada log arest kiye gaye the
 The original video is here

 com Jagmeet Singh Brar, a former member of the Congress Working Committee, said in a rude statement today that there is "no harm" if Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi take two years' leave in view of the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 punjab ke purv saansad barad ne kaha ki congress ke sabase kharaab haar ke baad abhi tak congress ke sabhi mahasachivon ko istipha de dena chahie tha or party kii kaman nae netaaon ko saunp deni chahie thi
 Brar, who has been angry for a long time, is the first Congress leader to demand the Gandhi family to step down but leave for a short time
 congress netaa ne kaha ki vah jo kah rahe hai vah ek congresskarmi kii tarah kah rahe hai, jisane party ke saath varshon gujaarey hai or unka maananaa he ki thodaa aaraam karne ke baad gandhi parivaar waapas laut saktaa he or is bich kuch netaa party kaa netritv kar sakate hai
 However, he did not spare even the 'advisors' of the leadership and said that they do not allow the party workers to interact with the leadership and they should leave the post immediately
 unhone kaha, 'yah ek samuhik jimmedaari he
 i am not saying that responsibility should be placed only on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 har kisi ko jimmedaari leni hogi
 They are also responsible
 main jo kah rahaa hum ki agar koi vyakti itane varshon tak party adhyaksh rahaa he, to use do varshon kii chuttee lene main koi nuksaan nahin he
 ' barad ne kaha, 'main yah bhi kah rahaa hum ki congress adhyaksh ne apana sarvshereshth yogadan diya he
 But if she leaves the post for two years, she will be more acceptable later
 ' yah poochne par ki kya vah yah maang kar rahe hai ki sonia or rahul ko pad chhod dena chahie to unhone kaha, 'maine yah nahin kaha
 i said there is no harm if they take two years off

 ) Pakistan's problems have increased after the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
 islamabad haalanki ab yah sabit karne main laga hua he ki use laden ke thikaane ke bare main uske maare jane tak koi jaankaree nahin thi
 The US may not take any drastic measures against Islamabad due to its dependence on Pakistan in the Afghanistan war, but Pakistan will have to answer many questions to prove that it was not aware of Laden's whereabouts
 samachar agency aaraaie novosti ke anusaar, jis parisar main alqaida sargana laden maaraa gaya, vah abtabad shahar main sthit ek pakistani sainya academy se lagbhag 100 meter kii duuri par sthit tha
 This raises the question whether the Pakistani Army did not know where bin Laden is hiding
 america seenet kii armd servisis cameti ke pramukh karl levin ne washington main somvaar ko patrakaron se kaha, "parisar sthal, laden ke vahaan nivas karne kii lambi avadhi or us parisar ko laden ke liye paroksh rup se nirmit kiye jane ko lekar, nihsandeh pakistani adhikariyon, sena or khufia vibhaag ko dher saare sawaalon ke jawaab dene hai
 "pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has said in this context," Laden was not in any place where we had predicted him to be
 " inkaar haalanki pakistan kii puraani aadat he
 India has been talking about the presence of terrorist structures on Pakistani soil for a long time, but despite strong evidence it has always denied it
 baharhaal, is karrwai par adhikariyon ke vivaadaaspad bayanon ne laden ke maare jane main pakistani khufia or sena ke yogadan ke akalan ko kathin bana diya he
 After US President Barack Obama announced the killing of bin Laden, US intelligence officials told reporters in Washington that Pakistani officials were not informed of the action
 america videsh mantri hillari clinton ne baad main somvaar ko kaha ki pakistani vishesh sainikon ke saath ghanishtha sahyog ne lakshya tak pahunchane main america kii madad kii
 Some military experts say that the US probably did not tell Pakistan about this planned action because Laden could flee after the information was leaked
 is baat ko raashtrapati jaradaari ne bhi sweekaar kiya he ki laden par hamalaa sanyukt karrwai nahin thi
 But he has underlined Pakistan's contribution in reaching Laden
 samachar patr 'washington post' main 'pakistan did its part' sheershak se prakashit ek vaicharik stambh main jaradaari ne kaha he, "yadhyapi ravivaar kii ghatana koi sanyukt karrwai nahin thi, lekin america or pakistan ke bich ek dashak ke sahyog or saajhedaari ke parinamswaroop hi laden kaa khaatmaa sambhav ho sakaa he
 "zardari has said," In Pakistan, we have some satisfaction with the fact that our initial cooperation in identifying an al-qaeda correspondent has finally made this day possible
 " laden ke maare jane ke baad ab abtabad shahar sthit us vishaal haveli ke maalik kii talash kii ja rahi he, jahaan laden chupa hua tha
 This mansion was built five years ago
 samachar patr 'don' ne sthaneey nivaasiyon ke hawaale se kaha he, "bin laden or uske parivaar ke yahaan hone ke bare main kisi ko koi jaankaree nahin thi
 "according to an official, this mansion was probably built close to the high security zone to protect it from foreign intelligence agents and electronic surveillance and drones
 ek vishleshak ne kaha he, "yah kisi bhi vyakti kii kalpana se pare kii baat thi ki laden ubad-khabad garm kabyli ilaakon ko chhodkar apni patniyon va bacchon ke saath abtabad jaise prakritik manoram sthal par paariwarik jivan bitaa rahaa hoga
 "on the other hand, Leon Panetta, director of the US intelligence agency CIA, has asked to be alert to potential terrorist threats after the killing of Laden
 paneta ne khufia agency ke karmchaariyon ko somvaar ko likhe ek patr main kaha, "aatankwaadi nishchit taur par badla lene kaa prayaas karenge or hamen satark or saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 "as a precaution, public services at the US Embassy and Consulate in Pakistan have been closed indefinitely
 duutavas ke pravaktaa albatre rodrigs ke hawaale se 'don' ne likhaa he, "duutavas main saarvajanik sevaaon se sambandhit saamaanya kaamkaaj band kar die gaye hai

 According to Election Commission records, separate voter ID cards have been issued to Kiran Bedi at the addresses of Uday Park and Talkatora Lane in Delhi
 is bare main puche jane par kiran bedi ne tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Election Commission officials said they are aware of this and are investigating whether they have applied for the cancellation of the first card containing the Talkatora Lane address
 chunaav ayog ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ‘ham mudde kii jaanch kar rahe hai or jald hi antim nattejey par pahunchaa jayega
 He indicated that if Kiran Bedi did not apply for cancellation of one of her two cards, legal action would be initiated against her
 udai park pataa vaale card kii idi sankhya TZD1656909 he, jabaki doosraa pataa kothi nan do, talkatoraa len he, jiskaa number SJE0047969 he

 bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne desh ke bhavi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko phone karke unhen bangladesh aane kaa nimantran diya
 He hoped that the two neighboring countries would work together and resolve any problem through bilateral negotiations
 modi ko hasina ke phone ke kuch ghante baad pradhanmantri karyaalay ke ek pravaktaa ne patrakaron ko bataaya, ‘unhone (hasina ne) bangladesh kii sarkaar or janata kii taraf se unhen (modi ko) mubaarakabaad di he

 supreme court ke paanch nyaayadhishon kii sanvaidhanik khandpeeth ne navtej johar or anya maamle main sarvasammati se die apane faisle main samalangikta ko aparaadh na maanate hue algebitii vyaktiyon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko manyata di
 It was appreciated all over the country and around the world and people celebrated it by showcasing their joy and emotions
 chaar faisle ek saath sunaane se yah spasht he ki unka nirnay shaks kii marji or pasand ke adhikaar kaa bharpoor samarthan karata he
 Judges have held that this right includes the right to choose one's partner, the right to sexual freedom and action, the right to love, the right to live one's life with dignity that is not limited only to the extent of privacy in the walls of the home It may be rather it is attached to one's body so it should be extended to public places
 vyaktigat swatantraaa ke is adhikaar ko or vistrut rup se paribhaashit karte hue nyaayadhishon ke tark ko, supreme court ke 2013 ke kaushal maamle main apane hi faisle ke vistaar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, jisamen adaalat ne ipisi kii dhara 377 ko behaal karne or samalangikta ko phir se aapraadhik krity ke rup main dekhe jane kaa faisla diya tha
 In the cases that were jointly decided on the list — the NALSA (2014) case recognizing the citizenship rights of transgender communities, the Puttuswamy (2017) case, which upheld the fundamental right to privacy, in relation to someone of their choice One who upholds the right to be
 shafin jahaan (2018) cese, shaayara bano (2017) cese jisamen yah kaha gaya ki yadi koi kanoon manamaane dhang se lagu kiya jaataa he to use asanvaidhanik maanakar radd kar diya ja saktaa he, kaaman coj kii yachika jisamen kisi vyakti ke maranasann ho jane par use ek sammanjanak mrityu ke adhikaar kii apil thi, apni pasand ke anusaar jeevanasathi chunane ke adhikaar se judaa shakti vahini (2018) cese jo kisi vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa se judaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he or honor kiling ke liye adaalat ne kisi vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron kaa hanan bataaya or ise roke jane kii vyavastha di—shaamil hai
 At the heart of judges' interpretation of the right to personal liberty is the right to dignity which is associated with the right to privacy and the right to exercise options without fear
 jo baat badi mahatvapurn he or is faisle se pehle ke maamalon se jiskaa judaav he, vah yah he ki adaalat ne sansarg ke vichaar ko garima ke adhikaar se jod diya he
 According to the judges, just as the state is bound to protect individual rights, it is equally important for society to respect individual rights
 is prakaar navtej johar maamle par aae faisle se aise anek maamalon ko lekar sambhaavnaaon ke dwaar khul jate hai jahaan vyaktigat swaittata or vyaktiyon kii nijee pasand ke adhikaron kaa hanan hota he
 The second set of arguments through consolidated judgments in four cases, the right to equality under Article 14 (right to equality and equal protection of law) and prohibition of discrimination on the basis of Article 15 (religion, caste, race, sex, etc
) of the Constitution ) Strongly advocates
 nyaayadhishon kaa maananaa he ki dhara 377 dwaara "prakritik'' or "aprakritik'' yon sambhog ke bich kiya gaya bhed manamaane dhang se paribhaashit he, vaigyanik saakshyon se apusht he
 The Court also grounded all scientific research and perspectives, including the American Psychiatric Association, World Health Organization, and the Psychiatric Society of India perspectives on the subject in 2018
 sabhi ne mana he ki samalangikta maansik swasthya vikaar nahin or kisi bhi "upachaar'' se ise badla nahin ja saktaa
 The Court recognizes homosexuality as one of the various natural sexual variations found in nature
 nyaayadhishon ne air india banaam naragis mirza maamle (1981) main purv ke faisle ko radd karne ke liye "inteligible diferenshia test'' kii us aupchaarik vyakhya ko tyaag diya, jisamen supreme court ne ek bhedbhaavpurn niyam ko barkaraar rakhte hue kisi vimaan ke cabin kru main kaam karne vaale purushon or mahilaon ke bich vetan or padonnati se sambandhit nitiyon main asamantaaon ko uchit tehra diya tha
 The court's decision was based on a very narrow interpretation of Article 15 that justified conservative views regarding the roles of men and women and upheld the notion that women should take up the task of running a family
 nyaayalay ne samanta ke praavdhaanon kii vyakhya karte hue yah sweekaar kiya ki kanoon is vishay par tatasth he, uskaa samaaj ke ek varg par asmaan rup se bhedbhaavpurn prabhaav ho saktaa he
 In this specific case, section 377 does not specifically mention homosexuals but is widely applicable to LGBTI persons
 nyaayalay ne na sirf naragis mirza maamle main di gai sthiti ko spasht rup se khaarij kiya he balki ek kadam aage badhate hue kaha ki hamaare samvidhan main gunvattta praavdhaanon kii vyakhya langik roodhiwaadon, asmaan mandandon, maanviya kaamuktha ke dwiguni nirupan ko chunauti dene ke liye kii jaani chahie or justise chandrachud ne to "yon anubhav ke badlaavon'' or "jivan ke vishmangi tareekon or pyaar va laalasaa ke anant rangon'' ke sangrakshan kii baat kahi
 The judges interpreted Article 15, supporting decisions made in preceding cases such as NALSA that prevented discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual interests and also made extensive reference to international case law related to the subject
 isamen unhone naaz foundation ke us tark ko doharaaya he jisamen dilli ucch nyaayalay bhi aise hi nishkarsh par pahunchaa tha
 One aspect of this judgment is also, which reiterates the Naz Foundation's arguments regarding the role of judges, that constitutional ethics should be preferred over social morality in court decisions
 suresh kumaar kaushal maamle main hue nirnay ke "sanvaidhaniktaa kii dharna'' ke tark (samvidhan ke purv-aupniveshik kanoonon ko hi lagu kiya jayega jab tak ki unhen spasht rup se sanshodhit nahin kiya jaataa he) ko khaarij karte hue adaalat kaa kahana he ki aisi dharna us tarah ke maamle main uchit nahin hoti he jahaan yachikakarta ne moulik adhikaron ke spasht ulanghan se judaa mudda uthaaya ho
 The Court has emphasized that when the legislature and the executive fail to protect fundamental rights violations, then the court should intervene and protect the rights
 nyaayalay ne yah mana he ki aise logon kii sankhya chaahe kitni hi kam ho phir bhi "pruthak or simity pahchaan ke adhikaron kii raksha nyaayalay kaa kartavya he
 The court held that Section 377 was never just related to prosecution, but was to show fear of litigation, blackmail, intimidate someone and promote a culture of LGBTI people tarnishing it by keeping their identity hidden
 sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki bhartiya samvidhan ke charitra or drushti ke mul main bahulata, vividhta, samavesh, samanta, bandhuta or swatantraaa ke adarsh hai
 They highlight the transformative nature of the Indian Constitution as a document that is vibrant and dynamic and committed to social change
 sanvaidhanik naitikta ko lekar apni joardaar abhivyakti main, vishesh rup se bandhuta ke sanvaidhanik mulya ke madhyam se, nyaayadhishon ne spasht kiya ki ve sirf rajya ke haathon adhikaron ke ulanghan kii baat nahin kah rahe, balki samaaj main anya karkon ke haathon ulanghan kii bhi baat kar rahe hai
 Their decisions are an open challenge to values that promote honor killing, hinder inter-religious and inter-ethnic marriages, and the abduction, forced marriages, house-keeping of families in the name of protecting their reputation Like violence is done
 nyaayalay ne apane is faisle se na keval algebitii vyaktiyon ke adhikaron kii suraksha kaa nirnay diya he, balki us samaaj main unke liye samanta ke vyavhaar kii baat kii he jisamen ham rahete hai
 His interpretation of constitutional ethics and the value of fraternity was in the context of majority and minority people in society
 is faisle kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he ki isamen gaiyr-pratigaman ke siddhant par bharosa jataayaa gaya he
 According to this principle, the state should not take steps that will cause willful erosion of rights
 nyaayalay kaa maananaa he ki kaushal maamle main die faisle ke anusaar chalane kaa arth hoga ki ham samvidhan ke tahat mili adhikaron ke prati pragatisheel soch se dur chale jaaen
 The judges have also approved the parents and families of LGBTI individuals, although many of these have been interfering with various stages of the legal challenge to Section 377
 nyaayalay ne nyaayamurti lila seth kaa uddhran diya, jinhone kaushal faisle ke baad, ek lekh likhaa jisamen unhone ek maa or ek nyaayadhish kaa drushtikon rakhaa or us faisle ko amanviya or atyadhik krur bataate hue katu aalochana kii thi
 Justice Malhotra, in his concurring opinion, has given an extraordinary statement saying that history should apologize to LGBTI individuals and their families as they have faced anonymity and exclusion for centuries
 kushal maamle main supreme court ke 2013 ke faisle ko palatate hue nyaayamurti malhotra ke bayaan main jo pashchaatap dikhaa he vah puure nyaayalay ke mood ko darshata he ki is maamle main nyaayadhishon ne apane faisle main kahe gaye apmanjanak shabdon ke kaaran yachikakartaon ko jo dukh, dard or ksht pahunchaa, uske liye unhen behad afsos he
 Navtej Singh Johar opened the way for a round of hope and change which brought great relief to the people and they are filled with a sense of joy and gratitude
 yah samay itane varshon ke athak prayaason or anginat anjaan logon kii avyakt kahaniyon, unke prati kanoon ke nazariye or is vishay ko sulajhane ke liye duniyabar ke vibhinn kshamtaaon vaale logon ke yogadan ko yaad karne or saraahne kaa he
 The verdict is part of an extraordinary political and emotional journey, an ongoing struggle for equal rights and a vigorous attack on the hypocrisies of a society that becomes highly violent towards those who dare to live their own way
 siddharth narayan dilli main vakil or legal research hancourt ne is faisle main sirf algebitii logon ko adhikaron kii guarantee nahin di balki samanta ko samaaj kaa najariya bhi bataaya he*** Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Friday that Russian Navy engineers would assist the Indian Navy in investigating the case of the blast at INS Sindhurakshak

 Rahul said, 'you should stop asking your leaders how they are going to do something
 aisa karne ke bajaay aapako khud se yah sawaal karnaa chahie ki aap kisi kaam ko kis tarah karenge
 This is because the country will proceed in this way
 rahul ne ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue yah baat kahi
 He was asked how he would educate illiterate children
 jab jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke ek chaatr ne rahul se yah sawaal kiya to congress netaa ne jawaab main kaha, 'kya main aapse ek sawaal kar saktaa hum? aap kis tarah unki madad karne ja rahe hai? ek naagarik ke taur par nahin balki ek yuva bhartiya ke taur par aap kis tarah unki madad karne ja rahe hai?' GN Azad: In CWC meeting everyone unanimously told him (rahul Gandhi) he did a good job
 
 
 No one has a doubt on his leadership but situation was like that
 If someone can lead the party in such situation
 it's only Rahul Gandhi, if anyone can lead opposition, it's only Rahul Gandhi

 At the same time, softness has been seen in Mulayam's attitude on the issue of whether to declare him the chief ministerial candidate or to reconcile
 aapako bataa den ki naresh agarwal ne mulaayam singh se apil kii he ki vochunaav ayogmein peeche hat jaaen or akhilesh ko aashirwad den
 He has said that 'every father wants his son to move forward and Akhilesh is a star
 netaji aisa karenge to unka sammaan or kad ooncha rahegaa or ham sab ek rahenge
 Although Mulayam Singh has said that the party's chief ministerial candidate will be Akhilesh but there are no signs of reconciliation as yet
 party main ek soch yah bhi he ki agar chunaav ayog ne is jhagade ke kaaran chunaav chinh jabt kar liya to chunaavon main pareshaani ho sakati he isliye daawa waapas lenaa behatar hoga

 What to do when the faith becomes blind and mischievous, the peak becomes the headlines
 kehete hai jhooth ke paanv nahin hote lekin jhooth kii chaal behad tej hoti he
 Now you can see that the fear of cutting off the shells started from Rajasthan, has taken half India in its grip
 har ek nai vaardaat ke saath hi nai kahani bhi saamne aati he
 Somebody looks like a man, someone cat someone, but someone has failed to find a clue as to what is the truth
 police bhale hi apni ore se tafteesh kar rahi ho lekin chotii kaatane kii ye vaardaat kam hone kii jagah badhati hi ja rahi hai
 Three new incidents of cutting the peak have emerged from Delhi itself
 pehali vaardaat bahari dilli ke rohinee se he to duusari vaardaat dakshin pashchimi ke sarit vihaar ilaake se
 Someone was hurt by a woman working in a Kothi in Sector 11, Rohini
 vakt din kaa tha or wo us vakt kaam kar rahi thi
 While working, she was cleaning the balcony of Kothi, when a white shadow caught her
 isse pehle wo sanbhal paati apana hosh kho baithi or phir jab hosh aayaa to bal kate hue the
 The story is similar in Sarita Vihar too
 bas fark itnaa he ki pichhali vaardaat main maid ghar main kaam kar rahi thi to is ghatana main mahila ghar ke andar soi hui thi
 When sleep fell, i saw that the hair was scattered on the floor
 samaj nahin aayaa kab or kaise bal kaat die gaye
 An incident of cutting the peak also appeared in the beautiful city area of delhi
 yahaan 10veen class main padhane vaali ladki skool se ghar aane ke baad apane kamare main so rahi thi
 At that time his elder sister was also present in the house, who was sleeping in the outside room
 chaatra ke mutabik jab uski neend khuli to uske saath bhi vahi hua jisane desh bhar kildakiyonki neend uda rakhi he
 The peak cutting incident has also taken place in Misalgari in Mussoorie area of ghaziabad
 yahaan nishane par ek nahin balki do ladkiyaan thim
 It is claimed that when the two were sleeping in their house on Wednesday night, a person cut their hair
 na kisi ko aate hue dekha gaya na jate hue or na hi neend main bal katane kaa ehsaas hua
 Who is behind these incidents happening in North India
 iskaa pataa to ab tak nahin chalaa he lekin har maamle main shaq ke daayre main gharavaale or khud wo mahila yaa ladki hoti he, jiske saath ye ghatana ghati he
 However, due to such incidents, there is fear in the heart of the people
 or wo har vaardaat ke saath badhata ja rahaa he
 In Pakistan, a leader who has made controversial statements is criticized everywhere
 unhone apane bayaan main kaha tha ki amiron kii seva ke liye hi garib paidaa hote hai
 According to Friday's report by the newspaper Dawn, the ruling pml-nawaz Party senator Sardar Mohammad Yakub Khan Nassar made this disputed remark during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Thursday
 yah vivaadit bayaan tab saamne aayaa, jab pakistan pipuls party ne ek charchaa shuru kii ki kis prakaar sattarudh logon kii sampatti badhati ja rahi he or amiron ke hiton main faisle liye ja rahe hai
 He said, "the poor of the country will never get the right to decide their future
 " iske baad nasar ne kaha ki agar har koi amir ho jayega, to anaaj ugane or mazdooree karne ke liye koi nahin bachegaa
 He said, "this is a God-made system and they have made some people poor and some rich
 hamen is tantra main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 " haidar ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki saamaajik-aarthik varg logon kaa banaaya hua he or khuda kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Another Senator Mohammad Usman Khan Kakar said that God created all people equal and poor people are not born to serve the rich
 tippaniyan But Nasser did not understand this and said, "at one time in China, everyone was considered equal, which did not work
 " unhone kaha, "jo log shiksha nahin praapt kar sakate or zyada se zyada nahin kama sakate, unhen naukarshahon-sa jivan jeene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he

 ) In the budget session of Parliament before the general elections, the opposition is once again repeating the demand of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) questioning the Rafale deal
 vipaksh ne media main prakashit rafel saude se jude tathyon kaa hawala dete hue ek baar phir apane aaropon ko doharaate hue kaha ki taaja tathyon se saaf he ki rafel saude main pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa hastkshep tha, lihaaja ab unhen sirf jepisi par bharosa he
 What is written in the letter? a government document published in an English newspaper is claiming that the Ministry of Defense had written a letter to the Minister of Defense regarding the Rafale deal
 patr main raksha mantralay kii taraf se kaha gaya tha ki pradhanmantri karyaalay dwaara rafel saude main samanaantar baatcheet se raksha mantralay kii negoshiation team kii koshishon ko dhakka lag saktaa he
 The letter, sent by the Ministry to the Defense Minister, was issued by SK Sharma, the deputy secretary in the ministry on 24 November 2015 and the letter was agreed to by the Director General Acquisition responsible for defense deals in the ministry
 vipaksh kaa kya aarope he?is patr ko aadhaar banaate hue din kii sansad kii karwai main trinmul congress ke saansad saugat roy ne sawaal uthaaya ki jab rafel vimaan kharidne ke liye raksha mantralay or france sarkaar ke bich baatcheet jari thi to kyon pradhanmantri karyaalay se hastkshep kiya gaya? vahiin inhen tathyon ke aadhaar par congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne ise gambhir maamla bataate hue kaha ki jab pradhanmantri, raksha mantri or air chif marshall is mudde par alag-alag baat kah rahe hai tab sachai ujagar karne ke liye sirf jepisi kaa rasta bachataa he
 What the government has clarified: Amidst the new facts and opposition allegations, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave clarification on behalf of the government in Lok Sabha
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki rafel maamle par sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kiya ja chukaa he or supreme court kaa faisla desh ke saamne he
 Therefore, the opposition is only doing the work of uprooting the dead
 rafel par pardaa barkaraar, rahul gandhi ke sawaal par aae nirmala ke bhi 5 sawalanirmala sitaraman ne raksha mantralay kii noting par kaha ki media main file noting ko puri tarah nahin prakashit kiya gaya he
 Nirmala said that the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar had given a clear answer to the file noting of the Defense Secretary
 lihaaja is sandarbh main tatkaaleen raksha mantri kaa jawaab behad ahm he jise na to prakashit kiya gaya or na hi vipaksh ne uthaaya
 Nirmala Sitharaman told the House that Manohar Parrikar in his file noting clearly told the Defense Secretary that there is a need to remain calm in the matter as things are moving in the right direction and there is no possibility of any disturbance
 rafel kaa vanshavaad: tajurba nahin, parivaar dekhakar dasolt ne kiya ambani se kararlihaaja, nirmala sitaraman ne sadan main daleel di ki yadi kisi maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay pragati jaananaa chahta he to use hastkshep nahin kaha janaa chahie
 Linking the opposition's stance with politics and corporate warfare, Nirmala said that the opposition is inspired by the war policy of multinational companies and is doing politics on the issue of national security for political gains only
 dekhen nirmala sitaraman kaa puraa bayaanwahin puure maamle par palatwaar karte hue nirmala sitaraman ne purv congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Nirmala asked the opposition whether at present he believes that he also sees the National Advisory Council formed under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi during the tenure of the former Congress government as an intervention in the Prime Minister's Office
 Therefore, the opposition should question the Rafale deal only if it also sees the NAC of the former government as an intervention in the Prime Minister's Office

 Assocham general secretary DS Rawat told reporters why it is important to give special status to Bihar
 is sambandh main unke sanghathan ne centre sarkaar ko 35 prishthon kaa ek maang patr saunpa he
 He said that Bihar can compete with other rapidly developing states in the race for development, provided that in the next five years in this state, in infrastructure and social sector 2
 5 lakh karod rupee kaa nivesh sunishchit karaayaa jaae
 Rawat said that in Bihar during the next five years
2
 5 lakh karod rupee kaa nivesh tabhi ho saktaa he jab use uttarakhand or himachal pradesh kii tarah hi vishesh rajya kaa darja diya jayega tathaa yahaan nivesh ke liye anukool maahaul banaaya jayega
 He said that about 20 per cent of the total gross state domestic product needs to be invested in the infrastructure sector in Bihar to be on par with other major states in terms of industrialization and to achieve high growth
 ravat ne kaha ki bihar main vikaas kii khaasi sambhaavnaaen he, lekin aarthik evam dhanchaagat aadhaar kaa str nimna hone ke kaaran yah pradesh tarakkee ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he
 He said that according to assocham's analysis, private sector investors have kept a distance from this province due to the structural flaws that have always existed in Bihar
 ravat ne kaha ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja milane se is pradesh kii arthvyavastha, udyog tathaa aadharbhoot sanrachana ke kshetra main nai chamak aegi tathaa is soobe ke logon ke jivan str main sudhaar hoga
 He said that Bihar's economy is developing the fastest in the country after Uttarakhand
 varsh 2004-05 tathaa varsh 2012-13 ke dauraan bihar kii vaarshik vikaas dar 9
 2 per cent, while India's economic growth rate was eight per cent during this period
 ravat ne kaha ki bihar main sambhaavnaaon ke dwaara puri tarah se kholane ke liye vittiya samaveshan ke saath shiksha tathaa swasthya ke kshetron main ullekhneey he or isamen sudhaar kiya janaa samay kii maang he
 He said that if Bihar is given the status of a special state, then its contribution to the economy of the country is 2 of the year 2012-13
 87 pratishat se badhakar saal 2016-17 main 3
 4 percent
 raghuram rajan samiti kii report main pichde rajyon ko atirikt vittiya sahaayta die jane kii anushansa se bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang par pani phirane ke bare main puche jane par ravat ne isse asahmati jataate hue kaha ki centre ko is report ko gambhirthapurvak lete hue pichde rajyon main vikaas main teji kaise laai jaae, yah sunishchit karnaa chahie
 He said that ASSOCHAM will meet mps during the Winter Session of Parliament starting next month to support the grant of special state status to Bihar
 khud par bharosa, takanic main maahir, lambii pari khilne kaa dhairya or gend ko teji se padhane kaa hunar
 If all these qualities are in the new batsman then no one can stop him from shining and all these qualities are coddled in budding Test cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara
 hyderabad main jis hoshiyaari se is honhaar ne apni pari ko buna he, usne kangaaroon ke hosh to uda hi die, number teen par ek khalipan ko bharne kii eemaandaar koshish bhi dikhaai he
 The encouraging thing is that Cheteshwar has been consistently adept in playing big innings and the result has again shown on the same ground where he scored a Test century against New Zealand
 bhartiya cricket kii is chattan ko jaise lambii pariyon se ek ajeeb sa ishk he
 You will be surprised to know that in first class cricket his bat has touched a score of more than 300 twice
 ek baar nazren tik jaaen to phir unki ankhon main teen ankon kaa sapana tairne lagata he
 That is why their conversion rate is also tremendous
 cheteshwar pujaara ne lage haathon hyderabad main 1000 test ranon kaa aankada bhi paar kar liya
 Vinod Kambli is the only cricketer in Indian cricket who has scored 1000 Test runs faster than him
 murali vijay ke saath unki 300 ran se zyada kii saajhedaari hi thi jisane team india ko ranon kaa pahaad khadaa karne kii hasarat jagaai
 Pujara has started removing the shortage of Dravid as soon as he comes into the team and is also getting the name of 'second wall' of Team India
 haalanki bharat or pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron kii baat se pehle jitani khinchataan ho rahi he, usase saaf he ki yah baatcheet jaise majaburi main ho rahi he

 According to information received by NDTV India, besides the evidence from Naved, a Pakistani terrorist caught in Jammu and Kashmir, the names of other intruders will be handed over to Pakistan
 iske alaava pakistan or uske kabje vaale kashmir main chal rahe 20 aatanki shiviron kii list bhi use di jaaegi
 The comments sutron ne bataaya ki in dastavezon main bharat ke 26 bhagodon kii suchi bhi hogi, jo pakistan main chupe baithe he
 In this list, seven new addresses of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, the mastermind of Mumbai blasts will be handed over

 If sources are to be believed, India will also put pressure on Pakistan to fix its house
 haalanki uske pehle bada sawaal yah he ki kya vaaki donon paksh baatcheet kii mez par aaenge? However, according to the news received from sources, amidst this infighting, India is preparing to give many proofs and documents during the conversation between Ajit Doval and Sartaj Aziz
 enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, jammu-kashmir main pakade gaye pakistani aatanki naved se mili sabooton ke alaava or bhi ghuspaithiyon ke naam paak ko saunpe jaaenge
 Apart from this, a list of 20 terrorist camps running in Pakistan and its occupied Kashmir will also be given to him
 tippaniyan Sources said that these documents will also contain a list of 26 fugitives from India, who are hiding in Pakistan
 is list main mumbai dhamaakon ke mastermind anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke saat nae pate saunpe jaaenge
 It is currently reported that Dawood is hiding near the plains in Pakistan
 sutron ke maane to, bharat pakistan par yah dabaav bhi banayega ki vah apana ghar durust kare
 However, the big question before that is, will the two sides really come to the negotiating table? enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, jammu-kashmir main pakade gaye pakistani aatanki naved se mili sabooton ke alaava or bhi ghuspaithiyon ke naam paak ko saunpe jaaenge

 Today, the trend of Kalselfylline is also in full swing

 a video is going viral in which South actors Shiva Kumar is seen mistreating a fan who took a selfie with him
 sivakumar madurai main kisi udghaatan samaaroh main chif guest ke rup main pahunche the

 com / w9hayktuvf— TC (@trollcinemaoff) October 29, 2018 The person was surprised to see Shivkumar's attitude
 saath hi aas-paas ke logon ko bhi kuch samaj nahin aayaa
 He was accompanied by minister RB Udayakumar at the ceremony
 ve madurai main ek privet fertility centre ke udghaatan ke maukey par pahunche the
 People have not liked this act of the actor
 log unki is harakat se kaaphi naaraaz najar aa rahe hai
 People have also asked the actor to apologize for this mistake
 kai logon ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki ve yoga prectis karne ke baad bhi apane gusse par niyantran nahin rakh paae
 The actor reacted to this saying, "I have no objection to the selfie
 yaadon ko sanjokar rakhane kaa ye ek acha tarika he
 But when the latter comes to the celebrity, then their privacy and respect needs to be taken care of
 jab main gaadi se utraa or venue par jane laga to main ye dekh kar kaaphi niraash hua ki kaise walantirs ko dhakka maar kar 20-30 prashansak selfi lene kii koshish kar rahe the

 '' In response to the show cause notice of the Election Commission, it is understood that Rahul Gandhi denied violating the Election Code of Conduct
 ayog ne unhen unki us kathith tippanee ke liye yah notice diya tha ki agar bhaajapa satta main aayi to 22 hajaar log hinsa main maare jaayenge
 According to sources, it is believed that the Congress vice-president has told the commission that he was merely referring to people's perception about the BJP and that he has not violated the model code of conduct
 chunaav ayog dwaara nau may ko jari kiye gayi kaaran bataao notice ke mutabik rahul gandhi ne ek may ko himachal pradesh ke solan main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kathith rup se yah kaha tha,‘‘japan ke log sawaal poochhate hai
 We have a fear
 ham aapaki madad karenge

 Will the people of India fight each other or not

 notebandi ke baad se sarkaar ke paas aae kaale dhan ko lekar basapa supremeo mayawati ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ke paas jitna bhi kaala dhan aayaa usase kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya janaa chahie
 At the same time, the Congress party made the same demand to the government, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said in the Rajya Sabha that the condition of farmers in the country is bad, so black money that has come after demonetisation should be used in debt waiver, the effect of demonetisation on the farmers of the country as well It is felt that farmers are selling kharif crops but they are not getting the money in time
 isse pehle kisaanon ke krishi karj maaf karne kii maang ko lekar rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh chau
 jantar-mantar dharna was also organized by the farmers under the leadership of Ajit Singh
 ajit singh ne kaha ki notebandi se kisaanon ko koi phayda nahin hone vaala he, kisaanon kaa phayda karana hi he to unke krishi karj maaf kiye janaa chahie
 At the same time, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda also said that due to the anti-farmer policies, the economic condition of the farmer is deteriorating, due to lack of remunerative value of the crop, he is being burdened with debt
 isi kaaran majaboor hokar kisaanatmahatyake liye majaboor he, centre sarkaar ko kisaanon ke karje tatkaal maaf karne chahie
 Three parties
 teen vichaardhaaraein
 Three unassuming leaders
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke amit shah, congress ke digvijay singh or aam aadmi party (aap) ke manish sisodiya ke bich bahes kaiyon kii ummid ke mutabik hi khuli siyaasi jang main tabdeel ho gai
 The debate started from Kurukshetra Uttar Pradesh in the Summer of Election and moving slowly it reached Gujarat, the home state of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 manch par baithne kii vyavastha bhi kuch alag hi dhang kii thi—digvijay or sisodiya ek sofe par baithe the to shah duusare par
 This loosely staged 'nexus' between the Congress and the AAP was symbolically showing that before the elections, both of them are trying to do everything possible to defeat the BJP in the race at the concept level
 pesh he in teen diggajon kii siyaasi jubaani takaraahat ke chuninda anshyamit shahyaap puure desh main najar daudakar dekhen to narendra modi ke paksh main aapako lahar saaf najar aa jaaegi
 The reason for this is that inflation, corruption and insecurity among women has arisen in the 10 years of UPA government's rule
 aise kai mudde hai jinako lekar logon main kaaphi asantosh he or ve bahut gusse main hai
 
 
 Ever since Narendra Modi has been made the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, hope has aroused in the people and now the whole country has started speaking about them in a tone
 digvijay singhikaha jaataa he ki narendra modi acha prashasan chalaane main sakasham hai
 i would like to ask Amit Shah whether his rule of good governance is that 32 police officers are in jail in his state? Where are the ministers criminals? Show us a model of good governance where a minister is in jail or tell us the secret of good governance in which a minister remains in the cabinet even after proven guilty? Tell us the secret of this good governance where the debt is Rs
 1,72,000 crores
 se zyada ho jabaki 1995 main gujarat par koi karj hi nahin tha
 
 
 You call it good governance? Amit Shah: i want to tell you that they (digvijay) are talking about me
 haa, main jail gaya
 Modi's rule is not responsible for this
 yah congress kii badla lene kii niti kii vajah se hua
 i am sure that all the cases CBI has filed are fake
 manish sisodiyanmen pichley do din se gujarat main hi tha
 There i went to the villages adjacent to the national and state highways
 maine paaya ki modiji saal bhar se jo kah rahe hai, vah sahi nahin he
 They have been saying the same thing for the last 12 years that Gujarat has made tremendous progress
 hakeekat yah he ki vahaan sadakon kii pahunch pichley 25 saal se he
 As far as the schools are concerned, four rooms have been made
