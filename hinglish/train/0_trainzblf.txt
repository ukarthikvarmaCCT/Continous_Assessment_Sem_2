 With a grand roadshow in Lucknow on February 11, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra officially entered politics as the election in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Congress general secretary
 uske baad unke bhai or party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaaryakartaaon ko nirdesh diya ki ve loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko nishaanaa na banaaen
 a few hours later SP chief Akhilesh Yadav expressed happiness at Priyanka's 'successful' roadshow during a wedding ceremony in Firozabad district
 unhone kaha, ''yah acchhee baat he ki bhaajapa-virodhipartiyon ko acchhee pratikriya mil rahi he
 Even better, the Congress is running this campaign
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress bhi sapa, basapa or anya choti partiyon ke mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa he
 This reaction of Akhilesh has sparked a fresh discussion because only last month the SP and BSP had announced a grand alliance, separating the Congress
 uske jawaab main congress ne akele hi sabhi siton par chunaav ladgaye kii ghoshnaa kar di or priyanka ko launch karke 'master stroke' bhi laga diya
 According to Congress sources, the reason for Priyanka's landing was that the SP-BSP was not ready to give more than 10 seats to the Congress
 vahiin, party ke jamini kaaryakartaaon ne rahul ko bataaya tha ki party agar rajya main loksabhaa kii kul 80 siton main aadhi se zyada siton par chunaav nahin ladati to party kaa sanghathan chapat ho jayega
 But there were warnings from some senior Congress leaders that fighting the elections alone out of the SP-BSP alliance would split the anti-bjp votes
 haalanki, aankadon kaa congress kii ore se kiya gaya vishleshan is ashanka ko galat bataata he
 "we found that if the votes of non-bjp voters (scheduled Castes, Other Backward Castes and Muslims) are divided between the SP-BSP alliance and the Congress, then 50% of the votes are divided," says a Congress leader who was involved in that analysis
 Our party can defeat both BJP and SP-BSP alliance, provided we get a good number of upper caste votes
 ''gandhi parivaar kii vanshaj or brahman cheharaa priyanka ke pravesh kaa makasad bhi savarna matadaataaon khaskar brahmanon ko rijhaanaa he
 "priyanka is very popular among the youth and women," says Praveen Chakraborty, head of the data analysis cell of the Congress
 ''akhilesh ke bayaan se sanket miltaa he ki sapa-basapa netritv apni ranneeti par dobaaraa vichaar kar rahaa he
 In the last one month, there have been several interactions between SP and senior Congress leaders
 2017 main congress-sapa gathbandhan banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaali priyanka ne basapa ko saath rakhte hue donon partiyon ko ekajute karne kii ummiden jagaa di hai
 However, the Congress wants an open exemption in eastern UP which the SP will not accept
 darasal, 2017 main sapa ne purvi upi kii 54 vidhansabha siton main se 27 siten jiti thim
 Apart from this, Muslims, who constitute 19 percent of the total population of the state, are important vote banks of both these parties
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main associat professor manish hindvi kehete hai, ''sapa-basapa ko pataa he ki unka utthan or patan congress kii safalataa yaa asafalataa ke vilom anupaat par nirbhar he
 "SP may be willing to talk to the Congress again but persuading BSP chief Mayawati will be a big challenge
" congress ke netaaon ko ummid he ki basapa pramukh ke saath achche sambandh rakhane vaali sonia gandhi is samasya ko hal kar sakati hai
 At the same time, Priyanka can play the role of mediator once again
 *** Are friends among the world's most maligned countries for the world's largest democracy and dictatorship? Instead of giving a direct answer to this question, we talk about many aspects of it
 newsflix kii report ke mutabik, bharat ke grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne sitambar 2016 main kaha tha ki unhen lagata he ki donon deshon ke bich puraani baadhaaen yaa shaq nahin rahanaa chahie
 He said that North Korea is an independent country and also a member of the United Nations
 haalanki, beete saalon main bharat ne north korea par yah aarope lagaaya tha ki vah pakistan ko newclear takanic bechata he

 Father John told that at different stages of age, the victim has had a love affair with the three priests of the church

 Earlier, the Attorney Journal had told the court that i have not received any instructions from the government so that some more time should be given

 When the reply was not received after the time was over, the court issued a notice of contempt against Prime Minister Gilani and ordered to appear on January 19
 pradhanmantri gilaani par agar avmaananaa kaa aarope sahi sabit ho jaataa he to unhen 6 maah kii jail or 5 varsh ke liye sansad se nishkasana kii sajaa bhi ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, the Law Minister of Pakistan has reached to meet Prime Minister Gilani

 It is worth mentioning that the National Assembly of Pakistan has a meeting on Monday evening

 rashtrabhasha hindi kaa tej vikaas or vah bhi bina sarkari baisakhi ke, udaarikaran ke daur kii ek hakeekat he
 Not only media, film, advertising, literature and language have also grown faster than expected in many fields
 beete do dashak main vigyaapan ke ek darjan bhi abhiyaan angreji main nahin chale honge
 The ratings of English and Hindi (and other major linguistic) channels on TV vary from ground to sky
 par aise bhi log hai, jo is daur kii hindi main araajaktaa, anushaasan-hinata dekhakar khinn hai
 If the answer to the complaints of people like him was made by senior journalist Arvind Kumar and his life partner Kusum Kumar by creating a parallel dictionary with sages like austerity earlier this year, then the newly published book of words by the young journalist Ajit Vadnekar is also a Hindi translation Meets a large deficiency
 ab bhale ajit ke guru dow
 Suresh Verma's claim to make it an encyclopaedia should be said in additional disciple affection but it is a strong interference in the work of Hindi language and dictionary building
 ajit kii kitaab ghoshit rup se hindi main prachlit padon ke janm sutron kii talash kaa byora he
 This work is quite interesting anyway, but Ajith has put a lot of life into it by choosing a fun title, interesting style and interesting words
 aamtaur par koshon ko palatnaa khaasaa ubaau kaam hota he
 This does not happen with this book of 460 pages
 aap ek ke baad ek shabd par aate hue unke saath hi bhashaa or samskruti ke vikaas ke safar par bhi chalate jate hai
 Many times the writer has also tried to make this knowledge book by leaving this interesting method
 par vah turant unki seemaa ko bataa detaa he
 Ajit is a keen journalist and has embarked on a journey of words in this eagerness
 ve isi naam se ek akhbaar main stambh likhte hai, internet par blog chalaate hai
 Own journalism and these regular regular works have given him the option to not only choose words from every field, discuss but also benefit from discussions on columns and blogs
 isliye bhi kitaab khaasi dilachasp ban gai he 
 But the writer who has been making the journey of words his main work for the past many years, he is also left with a very basic study of philology, grammar and dictionary formation during this time, it is surprising
 itnaa baari-bharkam granth taiyaar karne or puri shrinkhalaa kii yojana par kaam karne vaala lekhak yah kahe ki ''mere prayaas ko bhashaa shaastra or vyutpattishastra ke niyamon main baandhakar na dekha jaae'' to ise vidambnaa nahin to or kya kaha jayega
 Journalistic awareness is important, but when you come to this level in the works of thesaurus creation, language and etymology, then you need to know the basic 'tools'
 par lagata he ki lekhak ne 'laghu siddhant kaumudi' jaisi 60-65 prishthon vaali sanskrit vyakaran kii buniyadi pustika nahin padhi-dekhi he
 The remaining profit and loss due to these shortcomings, this book seems to have missed the effect of becoming a classic
 lekhak ne akhabaari stambh ke aakaar-prakaar ke hisaab se ek-ek shabd gucchh-uthaae hai or praayah dilachasp dhang se shabdon kii vyutpatti kii he
 But in many places they conclude on the basis of aerial imagery, in many places they mess up understanding of pact, emission and suffix
 kai baar mul shabd (yaa dhaatu) hi unki pakad main nahin aayaa he, khaskar urdu, farsi or arabi ke shabdon ke sandarbh main jabaki vishuddh hindi main hi maddah kaa urdu-hindi shabdkosh unki madad karne main kaaphi had tak sakasham he
 Less important are the Mukammil dictionaries like Maddah
 ajit jarurat se zyada 'sanskritparast' dikhte hai
 Also, he has paid very little attention to understanding the dialects of words and their relation to other native languages
 sambhawatah internet par europe or arab jagat kii bhashaaon or shabdon ke bare main zyada saamagree uplabdh hone se unka rujhaan udhar hua he
 Despite these shortcomings, this book breaks new ground in the Hindi language and young Ajit hopes that he will go to many stages of this journey and gradually overcome the mistakes that appear in the first phase

 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko asarhin or rajya ko 2 hisson main baantne ke faisla karke narendra modi sarkaar ne vipakshi dalon ko baikfoot par dhakel diya he
 With this master stroke of Modi, BJP is likely to get tremendous political advantage in the assembly elections of Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra
 mana ja rahaa he ki agami in teenon rajyon main hone vaale chunaav main bijepi is mudde ko apni sabase badi uplabdhi ke taur par pesh karegi
 Assembly elections are due in October in Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra
 aam chunaav kii jeet se utsahit bijepi ne haryana main mishan-75, jharkhand main target-65 or maharashtra main 220 plus siten jeetne kaa lakshya pehle se tay kar rakhaa he
 In such a situation, before the election of three states, BJP has made a big bet by disarming Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne air strike or rashtrawaad ke mudde ko damdaar tareeke se uthaaya tha
 BJP got tremendous political benefit from this
 iskaa nateeja tha ki narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi ko 2014 se zyada 2019 main badi jeet mili
 In such a situation, it is clear that the BJP can use the decision to abolish Article 370 in the upcoming state elections in the upcoming three states, because the party had resolved to abolish it from the beginning
 haryana kii siyasat ko kareeb se dekhne vaale anand rana kehete hai ki haryana ke har gaanv or takreeban har parivaar se koi na koi sena yaa police ke saath judaa hua he
 The most martyred soldiers for the country are from Haryana
 aise main modi sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke faisle se bijepi ko haryana main siyaasi phayda milane kii ummid he
 Rana says that religious trends have been very high in Haryana
 yahi vajah rahi he ki ram mandir or mandal andolan ne bhi pradesh kii siyasat ko prabhavit nahin kar saki
 The people of Haryana are proudly associated with nationalism, in such a way, BJP has increased its political graph in the state by deciding to abolish Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into 2 parts
 yahi vajah he ki haryana ke congress ke netaa deependra hooda party line se hatakar 370 asarhin karne ke faisle kaa swaagat kar rahe hai
 Hooda tweeted, 'I have a personal opinion that Article 370 is not justified in 21st century and it should be removed
 aisa sirf desh kii akhandta ke liye hi nahin, balki jammu-kashmir jo hamaare desh kaa abhinn ang he, ke hit main bhi he
 It is now the responsibility of the government to implement it in an atmosphere of peace and trust
 'anand rana kehete ki deependra hooda haryana kii siyasat ko bakhubi samajhate hai, isiilie dhara 370 ke hataane kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 If Hooda opposes, the political base that is left will also be lost
 isiilie samarthan karnaa unki majaburi he
 Like Haryana, the soil of Maharashtra and Jharkhand has a cordial engagement with nationalism
 maharashtra main bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena kaa raajnneetik aadhaar hindutv or rashtrawaad ke ird-gird rahaa he
 In such a situation, the decision to remove Article 370 from Kashmir and divide Jammu and Kashmir into 2 states, along with BJP, can be raised by the Shiv Sena in the upcoming assembly elections
 maharashtra or jharkhand main congress pehle se hi gutbaji se jujh rahi he
 In Maharashtra, Congress and its allies NCP mlas are joining BJP and Shiv Sena to save their political existence
 vahiin, jharkhand main congress ke netaa bijepi se ladane ke bajaay aapas main sir-footwwal karne main jute hai
 The opposition is completely scattered
 in sabake bich jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke faisla karke kaaphi badhat bana lee he

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was on a visit to Meerut on Tuesday
 is dauraan wo kaint ilaake main bane aughadnath mandir gaye or vahaan par puja archana kii
 He paid tribute to the martyrs by visiting a well built in the temple
 meerut main bhagwaan shiv ke is mandir ko zyaadaatar log kaali palaton mandir ke naam se jaanate hai
 And the well near which Yogi laid a wreath to the martyrs has a very important history
 1857 ke kranti kii shuruyaat darasal isi kune se hi hui thi
 The historical cantonment of Meerut is more than one and a half hundred years old
 tab bharat main british raaj tha or meerut kaa yah ilaaka chhavnee ilaaka tha jahaan sainikon ke barrack bane hue the
 People of both British and Indian armies lived in different places in the cantonment
 angrej bhartiya sainikon ke platoon ko kaali palaton kehete the
 There was a small Shiva temple near the Kali Paltan Barrack where Indian soldiers went to worship
 isi mandir se laga hua ek kuan bhi tha jahaan par pyau bana hua tha
 The place behind the temple was where Chandmari means shooting and the soldiers used to practice firing
 yaheen par bhartiya sainikon ke liye bana hua bazaar bhi tha jise laal kurti bazaar kaha jaataa tha
 The name Lal Kurti Bazar was derived because the British soldiers wore short red Kurti-like shirts during the British
 laal kurti kaa ilaaka meerut main abhi bhi vaise hi bana hua he
 The beginning of the military revolt began on 10 May 1857
 mandir ke pyau par kuch sainik pani pine ke liye gaye
 At that time the temple priests were sitting on the pyre
 sainikon ne hameshaa kii tarah pujari se pani pilaane ko kaha
 But the priest refused to give the soldiers water from his hand
 vajah puche jane par pujari ji ne kaha jo sainik gaay or boar kii charbi se bane hue kaartoos ko apane munh se kholte hai unhen vah apane haathon se pani nahin pilaa sakate kyonki vah puja paath karne vaale dharmik vyakti hai
 Indian soldiers were shocked by this
 unhone faisla kar liya yaa ab chaahe jo kuch ho jaae vahakaartoos ko munh nahin lagaayenge
 In fact, at that time, the cartridges used to be given to the soldiers for use in their guns had to be first cut with teeth and then applied in the gun
 kaha jaataa tha ki in kaartuson ko banane main gaay or boar kii charbi kaa istemaal hota tha
 a month ago, Mangal Pandey had revolted in Barrackpore, Bengal, and this matter had spread all around
 aazaadee kii pehali ladaai10 may 1857 ravivaar kaa din tha
 Many British officers were on leave that day and had gone to a nearby church
 us din nishanebaaji ke samay jab kaartoos ko kholane kii baari ai to bhartiya sainikon ne aisa karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 He got into a fight with the British on this matter
 bhartiya sainikon ne vahiin par teen angrej afasaron ko maar daalaa
 After that this thing spread to the present day and the other Indian soldiers also came out of their barracks and attacked the British
 in logon ne milakar carch par dhaava bol diya or bahut saare angrejon ko vahiin par maar daalaa
 Later, common people joined these Indian soldiers and Meerut was captured by Indian soldiers
 jaldi hi yah vidroh kii chingaari aasapaas ke ilaakon main fail gai or 1857 ke gadar kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi jise bhartiya aazaadee kii pehali ladaai kaha jaataa he
 India did not get independence from the revolution of 1857 but a very strong foundation was definitely laid for the freedom struggle
 kaali palaton ke chote se mandir kii jagah bhavy mandir ban gaya he or is kuen ko bhi dhakkar ab shahid smarak ke rup main badal diya gaya he jahaan par aakar log shaheedon ko shradhanjali arpit karte hai
 Many times people of British family also come here on May 10, whose ancestors died in the mutiny of 1857
 1857 se lekar ab tak meerut shahar kaa bahut vistaar ho chukaa he lekin abhi bhi yah ilaaka meerut kaint hi kehalaata he or is ilaake main bhartiya sena kii kaaphi badi chhavnee he

 '' cricket ke makka kahe jane vaale lords maidan par ballebaaji karnaa bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye hameshaa se mushkil sabit hua he
 The bat of Sachin Tendulkar, the master blaster on this ground, has also been able to show his brilliance, but the way Ajinkya Rahane batted on this ground was visible on the first day of the second match of the Test series against England
 ek ore jahaan murali vijay, shikhar dhawan, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli or captain em es dhoni jaise diggaj ballebaaj fail ho gaye to vahiin rahane ne centuri jadkar plaing ilevan main apni jagah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Rahane created these records by making a century on Lord's
 lords par pehle hi test match main centuri jadne vaale chauthe ballebaaj ban gaye hai ajinkya rahane
 The list of those who have done this feat before Rahane are Sourav Ganguly, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ajit Agarkar

 Ajinkya Rahane has become the sixth Indian batsman to score a century in England, batting at number five
 isse pehle mohammad ajaharuddin (do baar), vijay manjrekar, poli umarigar or saurav ganguli aisa kar chuke hai

 lords par test match kii pehali pari main or pehle hi din centuri jadne vaale ajinkya rahane ekmaatr bhartiya ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Rahane has played wonders on foreign soil earlier in Test: Rahane Test: Last year, Rahane was bat on South African tour
 disambar 2013 main durban test main is ballebaaj ne donon pariyon main pachaasa jadaa tha
 Although both these innings could not save India from defeat, Rahane definitely impressed everyone with his batting
 pehali pari main 51 ran banane ke baad duusari pari main rahane centuri ke kareeb pahunch kar out hue the
 Rahane saved the team from an innings defeat by scoring 96 runs
 wellington testaisi saal newjiland main rahane ke balle se test kariyar kii pehali centuri nikali thi
 While on the Kiwi soil, most of the batsmen of Team India were seen struggling, while Rahane played a fighting innings of 118 runs
 ye he khaasiyattest main rahane paanchaven yaa chathe number par ballebaaji karne utarate hai
 If the top order fails, it becomes very difficult to bat at this position
 kyonki agar yahaan se wicket girtaa he to telenders krij par aane shuru ho jate hai
 The special thing about Rahane's batting is that he does not scatter under pressure, but he has proved it before
 maharashtra kaa ye khilaadi videshi pich ho yaa videshi gendbaaj kisi ke saamne aasaani se ghutane nahin tekta he
 Rahane continues to play shots and exert pressure on the opposing bowler
 rahane ne test main abhi tak 3 badi paariyaan kheli hai jinamein 2 shatak shaamil hai, is dauraan unka strike rate hameshaa shandaar rahaa he
 He scored 61 in the Durban Test

 Fed up with the alleged molestation of a boy in Kalyanpur area, a student studying in class 11 committed suicide by setting fire
 ladki ke gharavaalon ne police ko bataaya ki uskaa ek dur kaa rishtedaar ladkaa use mobile phone par pareshaan karata tha tathaa college jate samay bhi use tang karata tha

 uski maa bazaar gai thi, jabaki pita kaam par gaya tha

 tippaniyan When Kalyanpur's SO Anand Mishra reached the spot, the girl's father alleged that his distant relative Guddu, a resident of Bara Sirohi, was repeatedly threatening her on the girl's mobile phone

 rajasthan ke kishangarh main field firing range main mortar fatne se biguef ke 9 jawan ghayal ho gaye
 The injured soldiers have been brought to Ramgarh, Jaisalmer for treatment, while the seriously injured soldiers have been airlifted to Jodhpur for treatment
 haadasa jaisalmer ke kishangarh field firing range main abhyaas ke dauraan tab hua jab ek 51 mem kaa mortar apni tayshuda range se pehle hi fat gaya
 According to the information received from BSF, 51 mm mortar has been torn 3 times in a year before
 gairatlab he ki kishangarh ke firing range main isi tarah kaa ek haadasa varsh 2012 main bhi hua tha
 In which four army personnel were injured
 is varsh hone vaala aisa yah doosraa haadasa he
 In March this year, four soldiers were injured in one such accident
 jharkhand ke hajaari baag firing range ke hue haadase main chah ardhsainik balon ke jawan ghayal ho gayi the
 In which only 51 mm mortar was being fired

 Modi's lawyer Rajesh Vyakaranam gave this information in an email to New Zealand Herald
 modi ne yah maamla isliye darj kiya he kyonki kerns par manahani se sambandhit maamle main galat sakshya pesh karne kaa aarope he

 - input bhashaa There can be no two opinions on the need to encourage defense production in India, but the strategy to achieve this has been much debated
 upie sarkaar ne ise raksha utpaadan niti 2010 main jagah di thi lekin vah vishwasaneey ranneeti nahin thi
 The new NDA government has stressed the need to encourage indigenous defense production
 isane pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii seemaa ko 26 fisadi se badhaakar 49 fisadi kar diya he
 Wherever possible access to state-of-the-art technology, more than 49 per cent FDI can also be approved in a selective manner
 aise 49 fisadi se zyada epadi vaale prastaavon ke liye is anivaaryta main riyaayat di gai he ki aavedak company kaa prabandhan kisi bhartiya ke haath main hona chahie
 The new condition has been brought that the company should be self-sufficient in the areas of product design and development
 ye badlaav swaagatyogy hai
 However, there are still many flaws in terms of the overall strategy to strengthen the defense production base
 ise shashakt karne ke liye vyapak paristhitiki tantra ke sandarbh main kai aise ahm maamle hai jinaki ore niti nirmaan ke str par dhyaan diya janaa hoga
 'make' in India has not yet started under the Defense Procurement System (DPP)
 laal kile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri ke ‘‘mek in india’’ ke aahvaan kaa arth he ki dipipi ke tahat ‘‘nirmaan’’ kii prakriya ko behaal kiya jaae
 In this process, the Ministry of Defense and the company will share the cost of prototype design and development in the ratio of 80:20
 ‘‘mek in india’’ ke antargat shastr pranali or praudyogiki kaa bauddhik sampada adhikaar bharat ke paas hi rahegaa
 So far, only two such projects that have been started, Future Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) and Tactical Communication System (TCS), both have slowed progress
 in do pariyojnaon kaa anubhav is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki aisi pariyojnaon ko samaybaddh tareeke se puraa karne ke maamle main raksha mantralay or sainya bal mukhyalay main kaabiliyat or kshamta kaa abhaav he
 20 to 25 projects of "make" in India need to be started so that the entire ecosystem of Indian defense production can be revived
 is uddeshy se sanyabalon ke liye 2012-2027 kii avadhi main long turm integrated persepective planning (altiipipi) ke tahat pahachaani gai pariyojnaon ke bainks integrated dephence staff (ids) dwaara vyavhaaryata reportein jari kiye jane kii jarurat hogi
 The planning process in the Ministry of Defense is weak and needs to be strengthened
 altiipipi 2012-2027 anivarytah kuch pariyojnaon kii avadharana, shastr pranaaliyon or praudyogikiyon kii ek suchi he jisaki jarurat sanyabalon ko apane ranneetik uddeshy or chunautiyaan puri karne ke liye padati he or jiskaa puunjigat vyay ke liye bajtiy aavanton ke saath koi rishta nahin hota
 In order to empower LTIPP 2012-2027, a clear liaison needs to be established between the planning goals and available resources over a 15-year timeframe in which the LTIPP receives approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security
 ubhartee hui bhu-ranneetik chunautiyon se nibatane ke liye sanyabalon kaa gambhir kshamta sanvardhan sirf sansaadhan aadhaarit yojana se hi kiya janaa sambhav he
 Apart from this, India's defense budget is also 0 of GDP
 75 fisadi badaye jane kii jarurat he
 Although FDI has been increased in defense production, one aspect that is often overlooked is that global manufacturers of fundamental defense equipment (oems) are not in a position to transfer technology without the approval of their mother governments
 
 isiilie epadi niti ke antargat udhyam str ke sambandhon ko peeche se sarkaron ke bich kootnithik rishton se sahaara die jane kii jarurat hogi
 Countries and continents have a wide range of options for doing this and the mutual arrangement between them will have to be driven by strategic objectives in this multi-polar world
 bharat ne raksha utpaadan karne vaale sarkari upakramon se baar-baar kharidne kaa aisa vikalp chun liya he jahaan uski naitik javabdehi, jokhim or khatre kam ho jate hai kyonki ye companiyaan khud sarkari hoti hai
 Getting rid of this model is the key challenge to encourage India's private sector to enter defense production
 pratispardhi boliyon ke madhyam se mulya nirdhaaran ke abhaav main iklauta vikalp keemat main mulya sanvardhan kaa rah jaataa he
 For this it becomes necessary to do a deep analysis of the price structure of private and government companies
 agar pandubbi jaise jatil upkarnon ke nirmaan ke liye nijee kshetra ko protsaahit karnaa he, tab unhen pariyojnaayen dene ke liye hamen pratispardhi boli vaali pranali kaa koi vikalp khojna hoga
 The Kelkar Committee recommended in 2005 that private sector companies be called national champions and handed over defense projects
 raksha mantralay is prastaav par aage nahin bad sakaa he
 If the country has to build a strong base of defense production in the private sector, then this deadlock will have to be broken
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki desh oonchi keemton par aise swadeshi nirmaan karata rahe jo vaishvik str par pratispardhi na hon
 It is said that the domestic production of Sukhoi SU-30 MKI is much more than the cost of importing such a fully manufactured aircraft from Russia
 raksha utpaadan kii sarkari companiyon or aayudh kaarkaanon ne ucch keemat vaala aisa dhaancha banaae rakhaa he ki unhen jab kabhi nijee kshetra se pratispardhaa milegi, ve kamjor pad jaaenge
 As the real test of global competition is exports, therefore, the export-oriented defense manufacturing base should be an essential part of the overall strategy
 iske alaava praudyogiki or order ke pravaah ko saarvajanik kshetra se nijee kshetra kii taraf modaa janaa bhi ‘‘bai and mek’’ pranali ke tahat ek ahm jarurat he
 The recent move by the Ministry of Defense to authorize oems to choose a private company from India to replace Auro's fleet is a welcome step
 aise hi faislon se bhartiya raksha tantra main sarkari upakramon ke prati gahare paithe aagrah ko durust kiya ja sakegaa or bharat ke nijee kshetra ko badaae kaa mauka diya ja sakegaa
 The past 13 years of experience have been blurred in this matter and defense production in India's private sector remains modest
 agar desh ko ek vishwasaneey sainya-audyogic pratishthan main tabdeel karnaa he to ranneetik drushti or disha dene kii jarurat hogi
 Today, this country cannot accept a shift backward from the previous decade

 The riots on the message of one Shah, a country, a language, the leaders of South India raised their opposition
 grih mantri amit shah ne hindi ko lekar ek ahvan kiya
 He said that we should have a language which can defeat English on the world stage, so we should try to use Hindi as much as possible
 magar shah ke is ahvan ne raajnneeti main ghamaasan machaa diya
 The opposition alleged that the Modi government is imposing Hindi on the country

 ' yahi nahin, unhone aage kaha ki samvidhan kaa anuchhed 29 har bhartiya ko apni alag bhashaa or samskruti kaa adhikaar pradaan karata he
 Asaduddin Owaisi rejected Shah's statement outright, but not only Owaisi, the opposition endorsed Amit Shah's statement saying that Shah is one country one law one country one legislation, one country one identity and one country one language
 The most beautiful identity of India in the name is ending the root of its diversity, it turned towards the new politics

 Hindi is not every Indian's "mother tongue"

 He said that if Hindi is removed from the freedom movement, the existence of the movement itself will end
 unhone kaha ki desh kii ek bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi hamaare purakhon ne rajbhasha kii kalpana kii thi or rajbhasha ke rup main hindi ko sweekaar kiya tha
 The breadth and richness of all the languages of our country is much greater than any other language in the world

 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar on Tuesday accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi of being inexperienced in the parliamentary case and accused him that there have been hurdles in parliamentary work ever since Rahul Gandhi became the President of Congress
 anant kumaar ne madhyapradesh bijepi karyaalay main press conference ke dauraan kaha, ‘rahul gandhi jab se congress ke adhyaksh bane hai tab se sansadeey kaary main baadha aa rahi he
 He has no experience in parliamentary work

 The minister gave the example, giving the example of this, the Union Minister said that the bill was passed in the Lok Sabha with the consensus of everyone, including the Congress, on the report presented in the matter of giving constitutional status to the Backward Classes Commission
 congress party ye jo vidheyak loksabhaa main paarit karti he, rahul gandhi ke baahar se aane ke baad rajyasabha main roak detii he, ye unki style he
 Anant Kumar said that the legislative and parliamentary work that has been done under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in four years is a record in the parliamentary history of India
 ye satr 119-120 fisad tak kaamyaab hue hai
 He said that against the state of emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, the BJP is celebrating 'kala Diwas' across the country today

 During the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha, BJP Deputy Leader SS Ahluwalia questioned why Krishna was silent when Qureshi Pillai and terrorist gangster Hafiz Mohammed Saeed were commenting on the same scales at a joint press conference with them in Islamabad recently
 Then why did he not defend Pillai even after coming to India

 a message created a stir on social media before Eid, the biggest Muslim festival
 is sandesh main daawa kiya gaya ki pashchim bengal sarkaar ne abhootpurv kadam uthaate hue id kii chhuttiyon ko chaar din tak badha diya he
 This means that all offices in West Bengal will be closed from June 12 to 17
 id kaa tyohaar sambhavat: shanivaar, 16 june ko hoga
 It is Sunday on 17 June
 is aashay kii report ko kai sthaneey bangla akhabaaron or kshetreey tivi channel par bhi dekha gaya
 The name of West Bengal has been in the limelight for the past few years due to violent incidents and factional conflicts
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko aisi ghatnaon ke liye virodhiyon kii aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 In such a situation, a four-day holiday message on Eid became a debate on social media
 kuch varisht iees adhikariyon samet kai logon ne is par tikhi pratikriya vyakt kii
 The holiday notification was allegedly issued by the June 8 letter from the audit branch of the Finance Department of West Bengal
 isamen likhaa gaya- ‘ id tyohaar ko yathochit dhang se manaane ke liye, jo 12 se 15 june 2018 ke bich he, rajyapal ko shaskeey avkaash 12 se 15 june tak ghoshit karne main prasannataa he, iske atirikt 16 june 2018 ko pehle hi saarvajanik avkaash adhishuchet kiya ja chukaa he
 On the basis of the above letter, when the messages were shared on social media, Kolkata Police got into action
 kolkata police ne 10 june ko twit kar is chitthee ko farji bataaya
 In such a situation, the question arose whether Mamata Banerjee Sarkar withdrew the holiday order after she was caught on social media, or was the fake letter spread on social media under some malice? We decided to go to the bottom to find out the truth about the letter
 beete saal mamata banerjee sarkaar ne muharram ke saath taarikh padane kii vajah se kuch ghanton ke liye durga pratimaaon ke visarjan par roak lagaai thi
 But the state government had to withdraw its order after the Calcutta High Court took a tough stand
 hoicourt ne jahaan pratimaaon ke visarjan par roak lagane ke liye sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai vahiin donon avasaron ke liye paryaapt suraksha vyavastha karne kaa aadesh diya
 At that time, opponents of Mamata Banerjee accused her of trying to appease the minorities for vote bank politics
 shuruyaat main ye sandigdh laga ki vitt vibhaag kaa puure rajya ke liye saarvajanik avkaash kii ghoshnaa se kya lenaa dena he
 But when we investigated, it was found that since 1957, the work of declaring public holidays in West Bengal has been the responsibility of the audit branch of the Finance Department
 vitt vibhaag kii website par saarvajanik chhuttiyon se sambandhit aise kai or aadesh bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 The letter related to the Eid holidays seemed genuine
 is par jahaan rajya sarkaar kaa logo ‘biswa-bangla’ maujuud dikhaa
 At the same time, the handover of the Governor was also accompanied by the signature of Additional Finance Secretary Rajasekhar Bandopadhyay
 lekin jab is sambandh main bandopadhyaay se baat kii gai to unhone saaf kiya ki ye unke hastakshar nahin he
 He also stated that he is working in the revenue section of the Finance Department, which has nothing to do with declaring public holidays
 ye vitt vibhaag ke audit branch kii ore se kiya jaataa he
 It was also seen that the 'biswa-bangla' state government logo is never used in regular circulars or orders
 ye baat chhuttiyon kii adhisuchana par bhi lagu hoti he
 If we compare the fake notification with any real notification on the government websites, then many more disturbances were noticed
 vitt vibhaag kii ore se jari adhisuchanaaon main hameshaa chitthee kramank hota he jo ‘F’ ke saath shuru hota he jiskaa aashay finance se hota he
 This was not the case in fake letters
 kolkata police shikaayat darj karne ke saath ye jaanch kar rahi he ki farji chitthee ke peeche koun ho saktaa he or aisa karne ke peeche kya manshaa thi
 It is interesting to know here that a fake letter of five similar holidays on Eid is also reported in Pakistan
 8 june kii taarikh vaali is chitthee se pakistan main bhi bhram ke halaat bane
 Pakistan Kejio News published a report describing this letter as fake
 iske alaavaamamata banerjeeek or farji khabar kii vajah se bhi nishane par hai
 This fake news is still being circulated on social media
 isamen daawa kiya gaya he ki rajya sarkaar kii ore se ek rictiyon ke liye vigyaapan jari kiya gaya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki aavedankarta sirf muslim hone chahie
 'reservation for Muslims' in government jobs was again highlighted on social media to reveal the alleged minority appeasement of Mamata Banerjee government
 lekin vigyaapan ko baariki se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki rikti kolkata municipal korporation ke liye thi
 Also, this vacancy belonged to the Muslim Bereal (burial) board department
 kalakatta berial board act, 1889 ke mutabik ye pad beete 129 saal se muslimon ke liye arakshit he
 There is indeed a reservation for Muslims for the post concerned, but it was misrepresented on social media
 oonchi mahangaai dar or eendhan kii keemton main vruddhi ne desh ke madhyam aay varg ke pariwaron ko manoranjan ke kharche main do tihaai katautee karne ko baadhya kar diya he, par dhani logon ke kharchon par oonchi mudrasphiti kaa koi khaas asar nahin hua he
 a survey by the industry body Assocham concluded
 survey par aadhaarit asochem kii ek vijyapti main kaha gaya he, 'madhyam aay varg ke parivaar shopping, manoranjan or baahar khaane par ausatan prati maah 4,000 se 6,000 rupee kharch kiya karte the
 'the survey has reduced such expenses of this class by up to two-thirds
 yah giravat aise samay main ai he jabaki farvari 2011 main sakal mudrasphiti 8
 Was 31 percent

 See how is Sachin's new home
 
 
 ek anya adhikari ne kaha, ‘agar nigam ne imaarat ko rahane ke liye feet ghoshit nahin kiya he to (tendulkar kaa) grih pravesh karana galat he

 The victim alleges that Himanshu locked her and her children in a room in the house

 The accused released him on Saturday
 iske baad mahila ne sthaneey logon ko aapbeetee sunai

 shaq ke ghere main ghar kaa mukhiya he
 It is believed that he committed suicide after killing his wife and his three daughters
 magar sabase bada sawaal ye he ki aakhir ghar ke mukhiya ne itnaa bada kadam kyon uthaaya
 At first glance, however, the police feel that the domestic quarrel became the cause of this heinous murder
 ghar se mili paanch laashenilahabaad ke dhuman ganj ilaake main pipal gaanv ke ek ghar main jab police daakhil hui to uske hosh phakhta ho gaye
 Inside the house there was a lot of slang
 ek-ek puri paanch laashen baahar nikaali gayi
 Manoj's corpse at the head of the house
 uski patni shweta kii laash
 Corpse of three daughters
 maut ne aisa tandav machaaya ki puraa parivaar khatm ho gaya
 The same question lingers in the minds of the people of the neighborhood with the police as to why this happened
 kaise hua
 Manojilake's men went out of the house in the morning to say that Manoj was last seen outside on Monday morning
 uske baad na to manoj baahar aayaa or naa hi uske parivaar kaa koi sadsy
 Neighbors were informed if something went wrong
 police maukey par pahunchi
 When the door of the house broke and entered inside, the scene was about to shake
 frij, almaari or bakse main bhi laashenghar kaa saamaan chaaron taraf bikharaa hua tha
 Manoj's body was hanging from the fan
 frij main patni shweta kii laash thi
 Preeti's body of 8 years in the cupboard
 3 saal kii shreya kii laash ko bakse main rakhaa gaya tha
 While the 6-year-old Shivani corpse lay on the bed
 ghar main koi aayaa-gaya bhi nahimpoore parivaar ke ek saath khatme kii ye khabar jangal main aag kii tarah fail gai
 a crowd of people gathered around the house
 maukey par esaspi or ediji bhi pahunch gaye
 At first glance, the police have not found any evidence of anyone entering and going out
 ghar ke mukhiya ne kiye katl, phir lagaai faanseemana ja rahaa he ki ghar ke mukhiya manoj ne hi pehle sabko maaraa or phir khudakushi kar lee
 Police suspect that everyone has been strangled to death
 haalanki is jaghanya hatyakand kaa makasad abhi tak saaf nahin he
 Police are prima facie considering the domestic quarrel as the reason for the murder
 kuch or to nahin is hatyakand kaa sach?police jaanch main har pahalu ko khangaal rahi he
 The corpses were sent for postmortem
 sawaal ye he ki agar manoj ko aatmahatya kerani thi, to usne patni or 2 botiyon kii laash ko frij, almaari or bakse main chupaane kii koshish kyon kii
 Was he trying to eradicate the evidence by hiding the corpse and escape? yaa phir is sansaneekhejahatyakandaka sach kuch or bhi ho saktaa he

 in kharabiyon kii vajah se metro kii puri line prabhavit hoti he or hajaaron musafiron ko pareshaani uthaani padati he
 Now the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has started the process of malpractices
 metro ke pravaktaa ke mutabik metro ek running system he or isamen oparational kharabi aana laazmi he, lekindmarsine yah mana he ki baar-baar aa rahi takneekee dikkat or ise thik karne main hone vaali deree chintaa kii baat he
 For this, the metro has started its own investigation internally
 mangalvaar kii takneekee kharabi signling kii samasya kii vajah se hui
 Metro's automatic signaling system stopped working in a block on Metro's Blue Line
 isaki vajah se metro ko dhimi raftaar main manual system ke aadhaar par chalaanaa padaa, lekin iskaa asar ye hua ki ek ke baad ek metro let hoti gayi or puraa treks circuit jam ho gaya
 The Blue Line is a busy line and metro trains run at full frequency here in peak hours, so if there is a malfunction in any part of the metro even for ten minutes, then the effect starts to appear on the entire line
 gauratlab he ki 2017 kii shuruyaat hi metro ke liye takneekee dikkaton ke saath hui thi
 There were three such occasions in January when the speed of the metro broke and the passengers faced problems
 iske baad farvari shuru hote hi mangalvaar musiibat bharaa sabit hua
 Now DMRC is claiming to overcome the frequent technical flaws, but the challenge does not seem easy given the pressure of the crowd of passengers in the metro
 sunanda pushkar hatya maamlemen esaiti ne shashi tharur se poochtacha kar lee he
 The SIT asked some serious questions to Shashi Tharoor in the Sunanda murder case
 poochtacha ke baad tharur jab vasant vihaar thane se baahar nikal rahe the, wo kaaphi pareshaan najar aae
 Know further about the questions that have brought troubles to Tharoor's forehead
 1)ghatana kii pisiar kol kyon nahin kii gai? sidhe thane phone karke sunanda kii maut kii jaankaree kyon di gai?2)kya aapane mail karke ames ke doctor ko sunda pushkar ke lopas beemaari se grast hone kii baat kahi thi? agar nahin, to kyon?3)wo koun he jo alprox or avsaad kii duusari dawaaen letaa tha? kya doctor ne kisi ko aisi dawaai lene kii salaah di thi?4)congress seshan ke baad aap kahaan gaye the? kya aap sidhe hotel aae the yaa phir kahin or gaye the? kahin or gaye the to uskaa koi saboot he?5)kya aapke or sunda ke bich 14 se 17 janvari 2014 ke bich koi jhagada hua tha?6)medical report main sunanda ke sharir par chot ke kai nishaan mili hai, jo 12 ghante se lekar 4 din puraane hai
 Where do the injury marks on his body come from? 7) The medical report states that Sunanda was neither ill nor had any disease before the death while you said she was undergoing treatment
 aisa kyon?8)kya sunanda or aapke bich jhagade itane bad gaye the ki wo aapako barbaad kar dene kii dhamkee detii thi?9)17 janvari ko us vakt aap kahaan the jab aapke paas sunda kii tabiyat ko lekar phone aayaa?10)eisisi kii meeting main aap kitni der tak the?11)agar aap main or sunda main jhagade hote the to uski vajah kya thi?12)kya aapako kisi par shaq he?13)kya sunda kii kisi tarah kii kisi ke saath dushmani thi?14)kya 15 janvari ko unke or sunanda ke bich airport par kis baat ko lekar jhagada hua tha
 15) Was there a fight between the two on the day of the murder on 17 January, as 15 marks were found on Sunanda's body
 so, agar abhi aapaki umr 40 saal or aasapaas he, or ritairement ke baad kii chintaa sata rahi he, to is maukey ko haath se jane na den

 Delhi BJP national minister Sardar RP Singh has written an open letter to social activist and former colleague of Arvind Kejriwal, Anna Hazare
 is khat main singh ne anna se kejariwal kii shikaayat kii he
 He has written that where Kejriwal has reached today, Anna's movement has a huge contribution
 aise main ab jab kejariwal kii sarkaar main gadabadiyaan saamne aa rahi hai, to anna ko unke khilaaf bhi saamne aana chahie
 Talking about the letter, RP Singh said, 'I have written this letter to remove the confusion that Kejriwal still has the support of Anna
 kejariwal ab anna ke dikhaae raste par nahin chal rahe hai
 "kejriwal wants unanimous rule over the party" In a letter written to Anna, the BJP leader has mentioned the events of India Against Corruption and then the creation of Kejriwal's political party to form the government in Delhi
 khat main anna ko likhaa gaya he ki dilli main sarkaar banane ke baad yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan se kejariwal ne kinaaraa kar liya, taaki party par ecchhatra raaj ho sake
 Ignoring the scams in the CM, the BJP leader wrote that Kejriwal's mlas were accused of fraud and cheating
 yahi nahin, siem banane ke badakejarivalane shila dikshit ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle main karrwai ke apane vaade ko puraa nahin kiya
 Not only this, Kejriwal is also ignoring the flaws in his own government
 unhone tanker ghotaale kii report ko dabaakar bhrashtachar ko badhaava diya
 The auto permit scam and CNG scam have also been mentioned in this paper
 kejariwal ko naseehat den annaarapy singh ne apil kii he ki anna ko in saare tathyon or paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue ek baar phir bhrashtachar ke khilaaf or raajnneetik shuchita banaae rakhane ke mudde par saamne aana chahie
 Anna Hazare has also been demanded to advise Kejriwal, because Kejriwal has reached this stage only with the help of Anna
 samvidhan kaa yah anuchhed bommai cese ke baad asprishy-sa ban gaya he
 Under this article, the central government can sack a state government in special situations
 apatkaal ke katu anubhavon ke baad bhi is anuchhed ko samaapt karne yaa ise niskriy maan lene kii baat kabhi nahin sochi gai
 But for the last 20-25 years, two important articles of the Constitution - 355 and 356 have been considered useless and purposeless
 rajya sarkaron dwaara alpsankhyak samudaay ke khilaaf suniyojit jansanhaar abhiyaan chalaane or samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke baad bhi in anuchhedon ke istemaal se na keval sarkarein bachati raheen balki buddhijivi bhi isaki baat karne se kataraata rahe
 Article 356 should be applied when governments formed by oath of constitution and parties expressing allegiance to the constitution and their organizations start supporting mass murder against the entire community
 nyaayamurti markandeya katju ne charchaa chhedakar is mahatvapurn anuchhed ko mrit avasthaa se jeevant avasthaa main laa diya he
 He has attracted the attention of the public and intellectuals that governments which are unable to maintain the rule of law should be dismissed under Article 356
 katju saadhaaran vyakti nahin hai
 He is born into a freedom fighter family and has been a judge of the Supreme Court and is the President of the Press Council of India
 ve vividh vishyon ke gyaata hai or unke nirnay evam lekh pathak ko sochane or karm karne ke liye prerit karte hai
 These Article of the Constitution are the final tools to protect the federal system and to make them inactive means to endanger the federal system
 yah sadiyon ke baad bane bharat rajya ke astitv ko hi sankat main daalana he
 For centuries our history has been to fight amongst ourselves and to fragment the nation
 aazaadee ke baad hamane jis sangheey vyavastha ko apanaaya vah america jaisi sangheey vyavastha nahin thi
 America's federal system was made up of a combination of independent states, while our federal system is built by the Center
 ataru yahaan rajya swytt hote hue bhi centre ke anushaasan main hai
 The task of maintaining law and order is with the states, but if the states have done so, then the constitution has given the central authority to dismiss the government and take over all its management
 is anuchhed kii sabase badi pariksha janata party ke shasankaal main hui jab centre sarkaar ne anek rajya sarkaron ko barkhaast kar vahaan nae chunaav karaae
 Home Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh argued that if there is no change in the states in accordance with the drastic changes brought by the Lok Sabha elections, a serious law and order situation will arise
 supreme court ne rajasthan cese main is tark ko sweekaar kiya or anuchhed 356 ke prayog ko sahi qaraar diya
 It then faced another major challenge when the governments ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were sacked after the Babri Masjid was toppled
 raashtrapati ke aadesh ke anumodan ke liye sansad main jo bahes hui usamen bijepi ko chhodkar sabhi partiyon ne is karrwai kaa samarthan kiya
 But the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, the bjp-ruled state, declared it constitutionally opposed
 apana faisla dete samay hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne jo tark diya usamen rajasthan cese ke nau jajon ke bench ke faisle ko badla gaya tha jo anhoni baat thi
 While the Rajasthan case verdict stated that the President's order could not be challenged, the High Court's decision raised several meaningless questions on the President's order
 madhu limaye dwaara is faisle kii aalochana kiye jane par ek vakil ne unke khilaaf manahani kaa cese daayar kar diya tha
 Limaye had welcomed it but the case was withdrawn, believing that it had no power
 baharhaal, is vivaad kaa ant supreme court ke paanch jajon ke bench ne bommai cese main kiya, jisamen bijepi sarkaron kii barkhaastagi ko sahi tehraaya gaya
 But the decision made the President's order relating to Article 356 the subject of a new controversy
 isamen kaha gaya ki nyaayalay raashtrapati ke aadesh se sambandhit paristhitiyon kii samiksha kar saktaa he
 This entire dispute was unrestrained and the dispute between the executive and the judiciary over the Golak Nath and Keshavanand Bharti cases was the result of that dispute
 yah vivaad madhya pradesh hycourt ke faisle se aage badha or bommai cese ke faisle ne is par mohar lagaai
 As a result of this, the Central governments refrained from using Article 356, but rather the guilt-ridden governments found an excuse to avoid the use of this article even after the rule of law was dismantled

 kendriya krishi mantri radha mohan singh ne ravivaar ko kaha ki pehali baar kendriya bajet main aisa praavdhaan kiya gaya he, jisase kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 He said that seven and a half percent of the money on the disclosure of black money would have to be given as farmers welfare surcharge
 agar yah kaam pehle kiya jaataa to kisaanon kii yah sthiti na hoti
 Those with black money cannot roam free for a long time, he said that strict action will be taken against those who keep black money, no matter how the money is earned
 bhartiya dalhan anusandhan santhaan (aiipiar) ke kaarykram main ravivaar dopaher hissaa lene pahunche krishi mantri se kaarykram ke baad patrakaron ne poocha ki bahut se amir log kisaan banakar kaledhan ko safed banane kaa kaam kar rahe hai

 singh ne maalya kaa sawaal to taal diya, lekin kaha, 'agar aap modi sarkaar kaa bajet dekhenge toye gaanv or garib kisaan kaa bajet he, jisase virodhiyon kii bolti band ho gai he
 The capitalist with black money may roam free for a few days, but soon he will come into possession because the budget has made so many stringent provisions for black money
 tex choron par hamaari sarkaar kadi karrwai karegi chaahe unhone jis tarah se kaala dhan kamaaya ho
 Speaking of the opponents, Bandradha Mohan said that as far as black money is concerned, for the first time in the budget, provision has been made that seven and a half percent farmers welfare will be surcharge on the disclosure of black money
 agar yah kaam pehle kiya jaataa to kisaanon kii yah sthiti nahin hoti
 Those who are capitalist people with money in any form, the government is very harsh for them
 unke liye desh main kaala dhan chhipaakar rakhana sambhav nahin he
 The Agriculture Minister said that people with black money are afraid because the first Prime Minister of the country is the one who has suffered poverty and under his rule, a man who has black money can not walk with his chest

 ' Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has questioned his attitude towards work, targeting the players who played poorly, after the Indian cricket team's consistently poor performance
 chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf kal mirpur main ek wicket kii haar ke baad gavaskar ne yah baat kii
 After this defeat, the Indian team is almost out of the race for the finals in the tournament of five countries

 "india's attitude towards work is not right," Gavaskar told NDTV

 They do not practice well and something like alternative practice is not for them
 shikhar dhawan or viraat kohli ke alaava kisi or ke paas a5yaas main hissaa nahin lene ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin he
 Gavaskar also targeted the top order and said that the batsmen were very confident and their shot selection was not right
 unhone kaha, bharat ne kuch wicket gairajaruri rup se ganvaa die or haal ke samay main pakistan ko jab bhi 250 ran kaa lakshya diya gaya to vah ise hasil karne main vifal rahaa
 So maybe we scored a few runs less
 unhone saath hi kaha ki sher-e-bangla stadium main chakke lagaana aasaan he kyonki boundry choti hai

 It is seen in the video that the rear fan of the helicopter collided with the container when the fuel was dropped
 kshatigrast hone ke baad helicopter kaa pichhlaa pankhaa turant tuutakar alag ho jaataa he or krash hone se pehle kuch secondon tak helicopter hawa main dolata rahaa
 Top officials of the Ministry of Defense told Aaj Tak that a Court of Inquiry was formed to investigate the incident, which exposed the shocking facts, which point to great negligence

 sheersh sutron ne ajtak ko bataaya ki jaisaaki video main dikhataa he jerrican parachute se alag ho jaataa he or helicopter ke pichley pankhe se takaraa jaataa he
 The helicopter then loses its balance and falls apart like a stone from the sky

 a senior defense ministry official aware of the investigation said that the handles of the jerrycans were very weak and caused it to break apart after being tied to the parachute
 ghatnakram se waakif ek senior helicopter ne bataaya ki 'eendhan sahit sabhi chizon ko airdrop karne ke spasht standard maanak hai
 The pilots followed suit and tried to keep the helicopter in the air even after the rear fan was damaged
 is maamle main yah dekha janaa chahie ki jericans ko aircraft par lod kaise kiya gaya
 He said that those who loaded the jerrycans into the chopper should be asked about it

 In this season, a drug named Gauchi has given cinematography a chance to color the screen fiercely
 60 ke dashak main america ke cicedelik culture kii yaad dilaate is drug ko lene par sartaaj se lekar gayatonde tak, bhootkaal ke apane shaitanon se sangharsh karte nazar aate he

 navazuddin siddiki pichley kuch samay main tipcast hue hai or kai baar aisa hota he ki unka abhinay chaunkaata nahin hai
 But Nawaz's critics will also be shocked to see his acting range after watching Sacred Games 2
 badla lene kii tadap main baithe gayatonde kaise apane astitv se jude sawaalon ko dhundta he or lagaataar badalte apane kirdaar main ve apana dabadabaa banaae rakhte hai
 How unsafe Gaitonde is even after becoming God, it is known only by going to Guruji's shelter
 gangstor ke taur par wo apni igo deth ke baad ek nayaa jivan paata he jise ant main ehsaas hota he ki use bhale hi duniya se koi matlab naa ho, lekin wo bombai ko kitna chahta he

 In the climax of the series, Nawazuddin and Saif Ali Khan perform some charisma like Edward Norton and Brad Pitt of Fight Club
 is siries kaa climex rongte khadey karne vaala he, jisase lagbhag waisi hi utsukata paidaa hoti he jaisaa christopher nolan kii film incepshan ke climex ko dekhakar hui thi
 The most powerful woman of this season is KD Yadav (amrita Subhash)
 subhash ek bharosemand marathi actress rah chuki hai or raman raghav 2
 She has also surprised people with her acting as Nawaz's sister in 0, especially the helplessness with which she cries

 The dialogues between Nawaz and Jojo resemble a tragic lovestory

 Bunty does not have a special role in this season
 haalanki apane chir parichit andaaj main bole gaye uske dialogs ek baar phir soshal media par chaa sakate hai
 But as Gaitonde says, this game is much bigger than all these things
 is sijan main guruji kaa chela trivedi or grahamantri bhonsle is desh ke karpt system ke wo pyaade hai jo samay aane par raja banakar khel palat sakate hai
 These are the evil faces of the modern era in which not even a little humanity has survived
 inase aap nafrat karnaa chaahate hai or apane shandaar abhinay se ve aisa karaane main safal rahete hai
 Inspector Parulkar's character comes to the climax to make all the sensations for himself
 ye teenon hi manje hue kalakaar hai or is sijan ke baad bhonsle or parulakar bollywood ke nae bharosemand kairactor actor ban kar ubhar sakate hai
 This character also leaves a positive impression due to the ups and downs of Majid's life compared to Season 1
 pehle sijan main parulakar ke peeche peeche najar aane vaala maajid jab aisa karne kii asal vajah bataata he to aapako ehsaas hota he ki bharat main kamobesh behatar sthiti main hone ke baavjood log apni aaidentity ke chalate logon ko kis tarah kaa balidaan dena padataa he
 Ranveer Shorey and Luke Kenny star in the roles of Shahid Khan and Malcolm

 For the last two-three days, news of Indrani Mukherjee has been on the news channels
 aisa dikhaaya ja rahaa he jaisi indrani ne koi bahut bada kaam kar diya he or uskaa naam itihaas main darj hone vaala he
 Indrani seems to have grasped these channels in her senses

 Repeatedly changing a news reduces the importance of the news
 vaise bhi kisi bhi vyakti kii nijee jindagi ko is tarah pesh karnaa galat he
 The most sad thing is that Sheena Bora, who has been murdered, questions his character
 indrani ne agar murder kiya he to kanoon use sajaa jarur degaa
 The media should also keep an eye on this news, but there should be no media trial in any case
 media ke kawarej main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he

 Now he needs entertainment along with news and news channels are becoming centers of entertainment
 jo zyada sanjeeda news dikhaa rahaa he vah reating main neeche ja rahaa he, uski tiarapy kam aa rahi he

 aisa lagata he tiarapy kaa matlab "televijan reating point" nahin balki "tension reating point" he
 The tension of TRP is also forcing a strong news channel to show such news, but it is wrong to hold everyone responsible
 aaj bhi aise kai channel hai jo apane usulon par date hue hai
 He is showing the news only after seeing the seriousness of it
 main yah nahin kahata ki media acha kaam nahin kar rahaa he, media kii vajah se kai pahalu bhi sulajhe hai
 The media understands its social responsibility and keeps raising the problems of the society, but the media should not be person centered

 media ke is rup ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa ha ki media apni saamaajik jimmedaari se bhaag rahaa he
 This type of news has begun to dominate social news
 media kii pahunch main vistaar to jarur hua he lekin is vistaar ke bhavishya par sawaal uthne laga he
 The media is aware of the problem of Sahar but it seems untouched by the problems of the villages
 tippaniyan It would be wrong to hold news channels solely responsible for all this
 hamaara darshak badal gaya he, uskaa swaad bhi badal gaya he
 He is bored after watching the serious news
 ab usko news ke saath -saath manoranjan bhi chahie or news channel manoranjan ke centre banate ja rahe hai
 The more sensitive news that is showing is going down in ratings, its TRP is coming down
 tiarapy ke tension ne news kii paribhaasha badal di he
 It seems TRP does not mean "television rating point" but "tension rating point"
 tiarapy kii tension ne ek majboot news channel ko bhi majaboor kar rahaa he, aisi khabaren dikhaane ke liye, lekin sabko jimmedaar maananaa galat he
 Even today, there are many channels which are stuck to their principles
 vah news ko gambhirtha ko dekhte hue hi use dikhaa rahe hai
 i do not say that the media is not doing well, because of the media, many aspects are solved
 media apni saamaajik jimmedaari ko samajhate hue samaaj kii samasyaon ko bhi uthaata rahata he, lekin media ko vyakti kendrit nahin hona chahie
 It is wrong not to take other important news seriously for such a news
 ek khabar ko itnaa or aisa nahin dikhaanaa chahie ki dikhaane vaala khud khabar main aa jaae
 On the other hand, the look becomes sad
 is sabake liye sirf news channelon ko jimmedaar maananaa galat hoga
 Our audience has changed, its taste has also changed
 sanjeeda news dekh dekhakar vah bor ho gaya he
 Now he needs entertainment along with news and news channels are becoming centers of entertainment
 jo zyada sanjeeda news dikhaa rahaa he vah reating main neeche ja rahaa he, uski tiarapy kam aa rahi he
 trp's tensions have changed the definition of news
 aisa lagata he tiarapy kaa matlab "televijan reating point" nahin balki "tension reating point" he
 The tension of TRP is also forcing a strong news channel to show such news, but it is wrong to hold everyone responsible
 aaj bhi aise kai channel hai jo apane usulon par date hue hai
 He is showing the news only after seeing the seriousness of it
 main yah nahin kahata ki media acha kaam nahin kar rahaa he, media kii vajah se kai pahalu bhi sulajhe hai
 The media understands its social responsibility and keeps raising the problems of the society, but the media should not be person centered
 ek aisi khabar ke liye duusari mahatvapurn khabaron ko gambhirtha se na lenaa galat he
 a news should not be seen so much that the show itself comes in the news
 duusari taraf dikhne vaala dukhi ho jaae
 i do not say that the media is not doing well, because of the media, many aspects are solved
 media apni saamaajik jimmedaari ko samajhate hue samaaj kii samasyaon ko bhi uthaata rahata he, lekin media ko vyakti kendrit nahin hona chahie
 It is wrong not to take other important news seriously for such a news
 ek khabar ko itnaa or aisa nahin dikhaanaa chahie ki dikhaane vaala khud khabar main aa jaae
 On the other hand, the look becomes sad

 In the Tehri Lok Sabha by-election in Uttarakhand, about 45 percent of the people exercised their franchise and sealed the fate of 14 candidates, including Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna's son and Congress candidate Saket and BJP candidate Maharani Rajya Laxmi Shah
 uttarakhand kii mukhya nirvachan adhikari radha ratudi ne bataaya ki tehri loksabhaa seat par upachunaav main matdaan ke liye kam matadaata baahar nikle or lagbhag 45 fisadi logon ne hi apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya
 There was no significant enthusiasm among voters in the by-election in the morning and only 20 percent polling was recorded till 12 noon
 mukhyamantri bahuguna ne haalanki apane matadhikaar kaa prayog karne ke baad matdaan kii dhimi gati par chintaa vyakt karte hue matadaataaon se gharon se baahar nikalne or kshetra ke vikaas ke liye badi sankhya main vot dene kii apil kii thi, lekin uskaa koi khaas asar shaam tak dekhne ko nahi mila

 In the by-election, a direct contest is being held between the Congress and BJP candidates, but who will be the last bet
 yah 13 oktober ko hone vaali matganana ke baad pataa chalegaa
 The Tehri Lok Sabha by-election was due to Bahuguna's resignation from his Lok Sabha membership in July last year after he was elected as an MLA from Sitarganj

 com / x1bneqmvzp— Sandesh Naik (@sandesh18333)march 6, 2018 The tussle between the Shiv Sena and Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam has gone one step further
 shivasena ke vidhayak vinod ghosalkar ne kaha ki vah chhath ke baad apane pad se istipha dekar sanjay nirupam ko sabak sikhayenge
 Shiv Sena MLA Vinod Ghosalkar said, "since i am an MLA, i have some limitations
" main sanvaidhanik pad kii shapath ke khilaaf nahin ja saktaa
 So i will submit my resignation to Uddhav Thackeray on November 5, after which i will teach Sanjay Nirupam a lesson on making statements against Uddhav and Aditya Thackeray
 ravivaar ko nirupam se naaraaz kuch shivasainikon ne kandiwali main nirupam ke offis par patharav kiya or poster bhi phaade
 Vinod Ghosalkar claimed responsibility for tearing the poster
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko donon netaaon sanjay nirupam or uddhav thakare ke postaron par kaalikh puti mili thi
 If it is a festival of Holi and not to talk about cannabis with Gulal, it is as if something is left incomplete
 apane tyohaar kaa majaa doguna karne ke liye is din kuch log guzia ke saath thandai main bhaang milakar bhi pite hai
 In such a situation, if the intoxication of cannabis becomes high, in that case hospitalization may also be required
 is pareshaani se bachaane ke liye aaj ham aapako bataaenge kuch aise upaay jinaki madad se aap bhaang kaa nasha jhat se utaar sakenge
 If the intoxication of cannabis becomes high, in that case do not ignore these symptoms at all
 lakshan-bhaang khaane ke baad vyakti kaa apane nervas system par control nahin rahata he
 This is the reason that people are not able to control any of their activity after drinking cannabis
 jisaki vajah se unamem bahut adhik hansanaa, ronaa, sona jaise kai lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai
 - Sometimes, due to eating too much cannabis, the person may not be in a position to recognize or remember anything for some time
 -dhyaan den, yadi koi vyakti bhaang kaa nasha karne ke baad apni ankhen kholkar so rahaa he to ise gambhirtha se lete hue use turant aspataal le jaaen, varanaa vyakti coma tak main ja saktaa he
 Home remedy - Ghee is the most effective way to get rid of cannabis
 ji haa, agar lage ki nasha zyada ho gaya he to 500 millilitre tak kii maatra main ghi kaa seven karen
 You can also use white butter to get rid of cannabis
 aisa karne se bhi aapako turant aaraam mil jayega
 - The best way to get cannabis intoxication is to eat sourness
 nasha zyada hone par dahi yaa dahi se bani chijen khaaen
 - Never take sweet things or heavy diet after you drink cannabis
 nasha utaarne ke liye bina shakkar yaa namak daalen neembu pani 4 se 5 baar pine par bhi bhaang kaa nasha utar jayega
 -if the person is in unconsciousness after drinking cannabis, then mustard oil is lukewarm and put in the person's ear
 ek-do boond sarson kaa tel donon kaanon main daalen
 These are some Ayurvedic medicines
 You can also take these Ayurvedic medicines to get drunk
 in ayurvedic dawaaon ke naam hai-panchadravyaghrut, panchatrikghrut, brahmi sipper or ashwagandharishth
 But remember, while doing this, please consult your doctor once

 Additional Superintendent of Police Anwar Hussain said that about 36 bodies have been recovered by the local rescuers so far and the search for others was on in the accident after a passenger boat overturned
 unhone kaha ki khabaron ke mutabik ingine nauka trollar main kareeb 80 yatri savaar the

 sharad pavaar ne dhai dhai saal ke siem kii baat kii thisharad pavaar ke is bade bayaan par surajevaala kaa jawaab When Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Ambedkar University in Lucknow on Friday afternoon after Varanasi, the students protested against the suicide of Rohit Vemula
 pradhanmantri kii sabha main chaatro ne hangaamaa kiya or 'modi go back' ke naare lagaae, vahiin piem ne jab sambodhan shuru kiya to rohit kaa naam lete hi bhavuk ho uthe
 PM Modi in his speech while referring to Rohit Vemula who committed suicide in Hyderabad said that the student was forced to commit suicide
 khaas baat yah rahi ki is dauranpiem bhavuk ho gaeor kuch der chup rahe
 The Prime Minister said, 'when i get the news that a young son of my country, Rohit is forced to commit suicide
 
 
 
 (silence for a while) What would have happened to his family
 maa bharti ne apana ek laal khoyaa
 The reason will be in its place
 raajnneeti apni jagah par hogi, lekin sachai ye he ki maa bharti ne apana ek laal khoyaa
 The Prime Minister said that he felt the pain of Rohit's death
 isse pehle sabha main hangaamaa kar rahe chaatro ko sabha sthal se baahar le jaaya gaya, jiske baad piem kaa sambodhan shuru hua
 The University has announced compensation
 Meanwhile, Hyderabad University has announced compensation of Rs 8 lakh to Rohit Vemula's family
 muaavje kii raashi kaa check rohit kii maa radhika ko jald hi saunp diya jayega
 The administration had demanded compensation of Rs 50 lakh by the university students

 However, the issue of the presence of any Dalit in the suspension committee has caught up
 kendriya mantri smriti irani ne kaha tha ki dalit chaatro par karrwai karne vaali jaanch samiti ke adhyaksh dalit hai, jabaki essi asti varg ke shikshak ise galat bataa rahe hai
 Varanasi also has a broken silence that Prime Minister Modi and his government are on target of opponents after the suicide of Dalit student of Hyderabad University, Vemulaki
 vipaksh ise dalit banaam gaiyr dalit kaa maamla bataa rahi he, jabaki kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne ise sire se khaarij kar diya
 Whereas in his statement, the minister also overemphasized the term Iranian Dalit
 baharhaal, ab tak vipaksh dwaara uthaae gaye dalit mudde par chuppi saadhane vaale pradhanmantri modi ne varanasi main kaha ki unki sarkaar daliton, garibon or vanchiton kii bhalaai kaa kaam karne ke liye patibaddh he
 Interestingly, Modi did not make any mention of the Rohit Vemula episode in the program of distributing assistive devices for the differently abled (physically challenged people)
 pradhanmantri ne isse pehle varanasi main nai train mahaamanaa express ko hari jhandi dikhaai
 This train has been run from Varanasi to Delhi and has many special features
 apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat main modi ne subah varanasi main hue ek haadase kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki kuch divyang or milanaa chahta tha, par haadasa ho gaya
 He said, 'the government will arrange for his treatment
 divyang bacchon kii chintaa saamaajik jimmedaari he
 Where we will have to change the rule or system, we will change this government is committed to the poor and is constantly trying to change their lives

 After this, reports of cold war of both were started and it was said that Shahid got jealous of him due to high praise of Ranveer in Padmavat
 haalanki ek intervyuu ke dauraan shahid ne kaha he ki wo apane kirdaar se santusht hai or unhen kisi se jalan nahin he
 Shahid said during the conversation that Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted to keep a talented actor like him in the film
 unhone film main kaam kisi kairactor kii vajah se nahin kiya balki isliye kiya kyonki sanjay unhen film main lenaa chaahate the
 Long before reading the script, he agreed to work in the film
 LFW 2018 main shahid-mira kaa Oops mument, dupattey ne aise bigaadashahid ne aage bataaya ki sanjay ne unase kaha tha ki wo unke bina ye film nahin bana sakate

 Significantly, the CBI arrested Chidambaram from his residence in Jor Bagh on 21 August
 sibiai ne 2007 main bataur vitt mantri chidambaram ke kaarykaal ke dauraan ienex media samooh ko videshi nivesh sanvardhan board dwaara 305 karod rupe ke nivesh kii manjuuri diye jane main kathith aniyamittaaon ko lekar 15 may, 2017 ko ek praathmiki darj kii thi
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in whose cabinet Chidambaram was finance minister, has questioned how he can be held responsible for the collective decision
 sarkaar ke chah sachivon sahit ek darjan adhikariyon ne jaanch kii thi or prastaav kii sifarish kii thi
 Chidambaram said, the recommendation was unanimously approved
 unhone kaha "agar mantri ek sifarish ko manjuuri dene ke liye uttaradaayi he, to sarkaar kii puri pranali dhwast ho jaaegi
 " desh main kareeb 95 fisadi trainen chalati hai lettejas train let hone par 250 rupee tak muaavjadesh kii pehali corporate train tejas express patari par daudane lagi he, jisamen deree hone par muaavja dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 On Friday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath flagged off the train in Lucknow
 tejas train ke let hone par yatriyon ko 250 rupee tak kaa muaavja dene kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Provision for compensation for Tejas train being latetej trains will be given compensation of Rs 100 if it is late for one hour and Rs 250 if it is late for 2 hours
 ab yahaan par sawaal uthta he ki kya tejas train kii tarah duusari trainon ke let hone par yatri muaavje kaa daawa kar sakate hai?is sambandh main edwocket kalika prasad kaala kaa kahana he ki agar train let hoti he, to isko kanjumar protection act ke tahat difishiency in sarvice yani sarvice main khami mana jaataa he
 For this, passengers can make a case in the Consumer Forum and get compensation
 edwocket kalika prasad kaala ne bataaya ki railway jis train tikat ko jari karata he, usamen bhi train ke ravaanaa hone or gantavy tak pahunchane kaa time likhaa hota he
 In such a situation, the train should not be late without any major reason
 train let hone par pehle bhi diya gaya muaavjaedwocket kaala ne yah bhi bataaya ki neshnal kanjumar dispute redresal kamishan ne saal 2011 main train let hone par biimaar padane vaale ek bujurg ko muaavja dilaa chukaa he
 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has considered the delay of the train to be inefficiency in service
 iske alaava bharat sarkaar banaam kedarnath jena ke maamle main odisha state kanjumar dispute redresal kamishan ne bhi shikayatakarta ko railway se muaavja dilaayaa tha
 In the case of Government of India vs Kedarnath Jena, the complainant was going from Cuttack to Bangalore to treat his son
 shikayatakarta jis train yani guwahati express se ja rahaa tha, vah kareeb 10 ghante tak let ho gai thi
 The complainant then complained about the matter to the Consumer Forum and claimed compensation
 edwocket kaala kaa kahana he ki desh main kareeb 95 fisadi train let chalati hai
 If passengers file a case in the Consumer Forum for delays in the train, then this process goes on and on, due to which it takes a long time for people to get compensation
 agar tejas kii tarah sabhi trainon ke let hone par yatriyon ko muaavja dene kii vyavastha ho jaae, to yah zyada behatar hoga
