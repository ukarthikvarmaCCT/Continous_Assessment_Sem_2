 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati musharraf ko faansee kii sajaaparvej musharraf ne badale kii bhaavana kaa lagaaya aropapakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko faansee kii sajaa sunai gai he
 At the same time, Musharraf has alleged that action has been taken against him in the spirit of revenge
 deshadroh cese main maut kii sajaa milane ke baad pakistan ke purv raashtrapatiparvej musharrafne apni chuppi tod di
 He alleged that action has been taken in the spirit of revenge
 musharraf ne kaha he ki aise faisle kaa koi udhaaharan nahin he, jisamen na to prativaadee or na hi mere vakil ko bachaav main kuch kehane kii anumati di gai thi
 According to a report by The News International, Musharraf said on Wednesday that he heard the judgment against him on TV
 unhone kaha ki unke paas aise maamle kaa aisa koi udhaaharan nahin he jahaan prativaadee yaa uske vakil ko apni daleelein pesh karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya gaya ho
 Musharraf said that he had proposed to give his statement to a special commission if he agreed to come to Dubai
 purv sainya taanashaah yahaan apana ilaaj kara rahe hai
 All the same for the law, he said, but his request was ignored
 unhone kaha, 'main is faisle ko sandigdh kahuunga kyonki maamle kii sunwaayee main shuruyaat se ant tak kanoon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya

 (input from IANS) yadi kisi dakshinpanthi sanghathan ne padmavat kii kahani likhi hoti to shaayad ve sanjay lila bhansaali se behatar yah kaam nahin kar pate
 Just think, Alauddin Khilji is a monster, who is compared to Yamraj and Ravana
 rajput vijetaon kii kaum hai
 Rani Padmavati is a poison drinker like Shiva
 agar film dekhne ke baad aisi dharna bane to aap kya kahenge?yah film aapako rajput or hindu raajaaon ke bare main gauravanvit karne kii koshish karti he
 Rajputs are brave people who do not lose, even if they lose, not because of a more powerful opposition army, but because of lapse and deception
 rani padmavati koi aisi kamjor ichhashakti vaali mahila nahin hai, jisane haar maanakar johar kiya ho, balki ek yoddha rani hai jo sena or yuddh kii ranneeti banaati hai
 Like Lord Shankar, when she shows her face as a reflection to Khilji, she deliberately drinks poison for the benefit of her people
 vah savitri kii tarah hai, jo apane pati satyawan ko jinda karne ke liye yamraj se lard jaati hai, maa kaali kii tarah taqatvar hai jo asuron kaa sanhaar karti hai
 Is this not a story that would make the Sangh Parivar and any of its supporters proud? The story reinforces the notion that it is a fight between 'bad Muslims' (who are foreigners coming to India via Afghanistan) and 'good Hindus'
 khilji he barbar badmashgaur karne kii ek baat yah bhi he ki bhansaali ne khilji or uskisena kopuri tarah se kaale kapadon or ratan singh tathaa unki sena ko safed kapadon main dikhaaya he
 Khalji, who has undergone many administrative reforms, is depicted in such a way that he is a rogue who has no quality of law
 vah boar kii tarah khaataa he, jaanwaron kii tarah kaamuk he or aisa ladaaka he jisaki koi izzat nahin he
 Does he get fascinated by the beauty of Rani Padmavati? No, he does not aspire to acquire her just because of beauty, but the fact is that a Rajput of Chittor tells him that Padmavati is the key to change his destiny
 ek aurat se pyaar karne vaale khilji ke prati bhi aapkaa sammaan nahin badhane vaala, kyonki aakhir vah barbar hamalavar he, jo aksar apane gulam malik kafoor ke saath rahanaa pasand karata he
 Here Malik Kafur is depicted as a tantrum, sneaky, erotic homo who is loyal to his boss
 kalpana kaa put zyada!lokapriy itihaas or charchit kahaniyon ke dam par bhi ise or behatar dikhaaya ja saktaa tha
 Just a fact that the Rajputs could not unite against King Khilji, so Ratan Singh had to fight alone
 'satya' or 'asaty' ke is 'dharmayuddh' main rani padmavati hi unhen salaah dene ke liye bachi thim
 The film makes the story interesting
 ladaai jab aamane-saamne kii ho gai tab bhi baat sainya kaushal kii nahin thi
 The defeat of Chittor was the biggest defeat of Khilji, as 'padmavati's body would turn to ashes before Khilji's hand fell'
 yahi nahin, ratan singh khilji ko veerta se ladaai kii peshkash karte hai- 'rajput ghayal or laachaar par waar nahin karte
 'when Khilji was preparing for war by raising the morale of his soldiers with his fiery speeches, Ratan Singh was encouraging the people of his fort by celebrating every Hindu festival
 yahi nahin, khilji ne bhoot kii tarah chah maheene tak registan main intjaar kiya
 Chittor was then celebrating Holi and Diwali, as if all good Hindus were waiting for the attack of the Sultan of Delhi

 safed kurte or sunahare dharidaar stole main saje pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 21 farvari ko pashchimi odisha ke bargarh main kisaanon kii sabha ko sambodhit kiya
 However, he was confronted by the TV cameras that were broadcasting his words across the country
 unka kahana tha ki kalabazari karne vaale or videshi dhan se chalane vaale asantusht enjio unki sarkaar ko badnaam or asthir karne kii “sajeesh” rach rahe hai
 Apparently, the reference to this message was a stalemate after Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Kanhaiya Kumar's arrest on February 12 on charges of treason, but he did not consider it necessary to state it
 is bayaan ko taarkik rup se kai myanon main vidambnaapurna kaha ja saktaa he
 The statement was a reminder of another speech of the past - the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's speech on All India Radio on November 11, 1975, in which she raised the issue of "foreign hands" trying to destabilize the country
 usee saal lagaai gai immergency ke bachaav main unka sabase bada aujaar yahi “videshi” tha
 Modi's speech was also strange because his government has failed to provide evidence of any such conspiracy
 iske ulat, kanhaiya kii giraftaar ke irdagird silsilewar tamaam sajishon ne janm le liya he
 For example, the beating of lawyers and tampering with tapes by police in front of police standing in the courtroom was allegedly used to prove treason
 is hafte jo bhi khulaase hue hai, jinamein adhiktar india today tivi ne kiye hai, ve dikhaate hai ki kanhaiya jeenyu parisar main bharat ke tukade karne sambandhi naare lagane waalon main shaayad shaamil nahin tha, ki ‘‘pakistan jindabad” kaa naaraa ek tivi channel ne galat dhang se uske maththe madh diya, jabaki kuch bhi saaf-saaf sunai nahin pad rahaa tha, vakeelon ne daawa kiya ki adaalat parisar main kanhaiya kii pitayee main unako dilli police kii shah mili hui thi
 The Delhi Police may have prepared papers in which it claims that it has evidence against Kanhaiya based on TV footage and witnesses, but it is yet to have a court review
 kendriya grih mantri kaa yah kahana bemaani-sa lagata he ki jeenyu ke chaatro ko lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sansthaapak hafiz said kaa samarthan hasil he
 This was probably based on a fake Twitter handle
 isse bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki yah (bakaul sunil khilanaani) vichaardhaaraon kaa hinsak sangharsh he, bharat ke vichaar (idia of india) par ek takaraav he or deshbhakti ke nae ubhaar par haaavee hone kii jang he jiske rajnatik or saamaajik nihitarth hai
 The episode, which began with a minor skirmish between two student groups in the country's prestigious educational institutions, has turned into a fundamental debate whose implications are the mandate of this government, the interpretation of the constitution, the importance of the right to dissent and the citizens achieved in democratic India
 Are much deeper in terms of independence
 kuch or sawaal hai jinka jawaab dhundha janaa he
 For example, the role of Hindutva in the Indian state, the definition of nationalism and the law of treason in Article 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which is a remnant of the British Raj and even 68 years after independence, various governments are still using it as a weapon
 jeenyu ke liye jo vajood kii jang he (bijepi netaa tathaa sampadak chandan mitra ne haal hi main likhaa tha ki sarkaar ko is maukey kaa phayda uthaakar jeenyu ko band kar dena chahie), vah hindutvvaadi dakshinpanth ke liye ek avasar banakar bhi ubhari he jisane deshbhakti kii ek nai jang ched daali he taaki vah apane saamaajik or saanskrithik agenda ko aage badha sake
 But the irony is that this agenda is against Modi's promise of "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" with which he won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 is takaraav kii asli vajah kya he? kyon, kisne aisa kiya or uske uddeshy kya hai
 To understand this, it is necessary to first take a look at the opportunity
 phija main inkulabkisi bhi bade saarvajanik santhaan kii tarah jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay bhi ek jeevant sanstha he
 Here, students with diverse views from different backgrounds openly express their feelings
 yahaan bhaawanaaon or samvednaaon kii vividhta he or isiilie kabhi-kabhaar ek hi din main kai virodhabhasi awaajen dikhti hai, phija main badalte hue kai rang-rup dekhe ja sakate hai
 Its large lecture halls witness ideological confrontations during the day, while walls covered with wall paintings are the site of deep theoretical discussions at night
 iske saath hi khubasurat bagichon main prem or mitrataa kii konpalein bhi aakaar leti rahati hai
 However, all these colors were missing from this institution with a history of disagreement and a tradition of dialogue
 isaki bajaae yahaan kii phija main ek halaki-si gandh or ek aisi urja kaa lagaataar ehsaas ho rahaa he, jo bahut spasht nahin he
 Don't get me wrong - it's the smell of revolution, not of treason
 vishvavidhyalay ke chaatrasangh or shikshak sangh ne-rabindranath ke shabdon main kahen to-“sankeern aapasi deevaaron” se apni aazaadee kaa elaan kar diya he
 Every evening they gather outside the administrative building and openly discuss the concept of nationalism through lectures and question-sessions
 saamaajik vigyaan ke professor atul sood ke shabdon main kahen, to muktangan main ek pathar par khadey apane kisi professor kii sangat main jeenyu apni “asahmati kii samskruti yaa asahmati kii buniyaad main maujuud vichaaron” kaa jashn manaa rahaa he
 The first lecture is by Gopal Guru, then comes the South African scholar Ari Sitas, the third number G
 arunima kaa vyaakhyaan hota he or ant main aaysha kidawai bolti hai
 If the idea is still not clear, then to understand the matter broadly, one can look at a stone on which it is written: Bol, Laba Azad hai Tere / Bol Juban is still yours
 yahi sari charchaa kaa saar he
 Traditionally dominated by leftists, liberal left and even some revolutionary leftists, JNU students and teachers allege that this atmosphere of free consultation is restless to suppress the right wing power of the center and the Sangh Parivar

 The university is going through its biggest crisis just weeks after Jagdish Kumar was appointed as the new vice-chancellor
 ise ve kisi badi yojana kaa saboot maanate hai
 Kanhaiya, who is doing research in African studies, said in his speech in JNU on February 10, "we belong to this country and love the soil of India
" ham desh ke un 80 fisadi logon ke liye ladate hai jo garib hai
 This is patriotism for us
 ” unki giraftaar ke do din baad chaatrasangh kii upaadhyaksh or emphil kii chaatra shahala rashid shora ne bina mike ke die ek sapaat bhaashan main aresas par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki jo log rashtriya dhvaj yaa samvidhan kaa sammaan nahin karte, ve deshadrohi hai
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi also agreed that it is different that they have been unpleasant for JNU for more than two decades but their support was welcomed here in view of the immediate crisis
 sonia ne 22 farvari ko kaha tha, “ek aisa sanghathan jisane aazaadee ke andolan main hissaa nahin liya, jisane kabhi rashtrapita ke liye koi sammaan nahin dikhaaya or jisane rashtriya dhvaj ke liye kabhi bhi koi shraddha jaahir nahin kii, uske paas deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kaa tamgaa baantne kaa shaayad hi koi adhikaar hona chahie
 "the unbridled manner in which the central government raises this issue by forcibly jumping into a fight between two student groups and then making serious allegations of treason without any concrete evidence is not going to give any benefit to it
" congress yuvaaon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye ise ek maukey ke rup main dekh rahi he
 Five other students — Omar Khalid, Rama Naga, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar and Anant Narayan — have also been charged with treason
 inamen iklaute muslim khalid ko asli nishaanaa banaaya gaya he kyonki uske khilaaf kai aise “sakshya” maujuud hai, jo yaa to paristhitijanya hai yaa phir dur kii kaudi najar aate hai
 For example, a major allegation against extremist and atheist Khalid is that he made more than 800 calls in early February in Kashmir, the Gulf and Bangladesh within four days
 jaisaa ki jeenyu kii purv chaatra or bollywood abhinetri swara bhaskar ne dhyaan dilaayaa he, iskaa matlab yah hua ki usne har ghante nau kol kii he or is dauraan vah bilkul bhi nahin soya he
 In an open letter to Khalid, Swara wrote, "and you keep missing this call, you are missing, amazing, you are Batman! Brother!" inamen sabase ahm hyderabad kendriya vishvavidhyalay he, jahaan shodh chaatr rohit vemula ne janvari main yah kehete hue khudakushi kar lee thi ki dalit hone ke naate uskaa utpeeda kiya gaya he
 Both the University of Hyderabad and JNU have seen this struggle as an anti-upper class struggle
 sarkaar kii pratikriya yah he ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne faisla kiya he ki prayek kendriya vishvavidhyalay main “rashtrawaad bharne” ke liye vahaan tirangaa fahraaya jayega
 However, there is no debate on what is distributing the country
 jeenyu ke chaatro ne 9 farvari ko vaaki afjal guru ko hui faansee ke khilaaf hi bolaa tha, jise 2001 main sansad par hamale ke maamle main sajaa hui thi
 a group of students shouted slogans in support of the Guru
 saath hi bhartiya rajyasatta kii nirankushta ke khilaaf bhi naare lagaae gaye, jiskaa matlab yah nikalataa he ki use paristhitijanya saakshyon ke aadhaar par hi doshi tehra diya gaya or galat tareeke se lataka diya gaya
 This hanging was given in 2013 under the UPA rule
 jeenyu ke chaatro kaa maananaa he ki loktantr main unhen is mudde ko uthaane kaa adhikaar he jabaki virdohi raay yah he ki afjal guru ke paksh main kisi bhi bayaanbaji apane aap main “rashtravirohi” hogi
 Several BJP leaders and civil society members have said similar things last week, to which JNU professor Kamal Mitra Chenoy says, "what was said that day was not a liberal thing and students and teachers condemned it, But there was no need to take such drastic action against the students
 yadi asanvaidhanik bayaan itane hi nagavar hai, tab sadhvi niranjan jyoti ke khilaaf koi karrwai kyon nahin kii gai jab unhone ramjade or haramjade vaala apana bayaan diya tha (2014 main dilli ke chunaavon ke dauraan)? unhen to maafeename ke baad chhod diya gaya tha
 "A question and an uncomfortable one here
 agar afjal guru or 1993 ke mumbai dhamaakon ke doshi yaqub memon kii faansee ke khilaaf bolnaa vaaki raashtra virdohi he, to bijepi ne jammu-kashmir main pidipi ke saath milakar sarkaar kyon banaai, jisane kai maukon par afjal guru ko shahid ghoshit kiya he? punjab main bijepi kaa sahyogi akali dal purv mukhyamantri beant singh ke hatyare balavant singh rajoana kaa samarthan karata he jise faansee hone se pehle akaal takht shahid ghoshit kar chukaa he
 In other words, are political arguments above nationalism? What does the Sangh want to do? The debate of nationalism has now been presented on the plate in front of the ruling BJP and RSS, so there are indications that they will fly away Are in Firaq
 koun rashtravirohi he or koun nahin, yah sawaal kai uddeshyon ko ek saath puraa kar saktaa he
 BJP insiders believe that the party, which faced electoral defeats in Bihar and Delhi in 2015, has got a new issue of polarization in its name
 pichley kuch samay se aise kisi mudde kii talash ke sanket bhi mil rahe the, khaskar isliye kyonki modi sarkaar behatar arthvyavastha or sushasan kii jin do naavon par savaar hokar satta main ai thi, vah vidhaayi jakadaaa main ulajh chukaa he
 Although India's economic growth figures are still good, sluggishness in agriculture, reduced investment and rising unemployment are making way for frustration
 nai satta “nunatam sarkaar, adhiktam sushasan” ke apane vaade ko puraa nahin kar saki he
 Various disinvestment projects are still stuck and the country is progressing very slowly in terms of ease of doing business in the world
 vikaas yaa achche dinon kaa koi sanket agar puri tarah nadaarad he to uski ek vajah yah bhi he ki aise lakshya lambii daud ke hote hai
 This is the reason why the BJP strategists were for a long time seeking an issue around which the party's base and support could be mobilized
 hindutv kii mashaal se pichley 18 maheenon ke dauraan lagaataar roshan hote rahe “lav jehad”, “ghar vaapasi” or gomance par pratibandh jaise muddon ne vaisaa samarthan nahin hasil kiya, jaisaa ki party ko ummid thi
 The party is also uncertain about the Ram temple, which has been put on hold for the time being and may be revived during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year
 muddon ke abhaav ke chalate hi rashtrawaad kii bahes kaa khuli baahon se swaagat kiya ja rahaa he
 The prevalence of anti-national is not only more than that of non-hindus, but issues such as nation, state and government are complex and emotional in such a way that they do not find any form of religion or caste, so it is more easy to create a narrative around them
 is
 agar aap raashtra virdohi hai, to iskaa swaabhaavik arth hoga ki aap pakistan samarthak hai or fouj virdohi bhi hai-aisi sasti taarkikta ko lekar koi bhi daud laga saktaa he
 a top BJP leader, who has also been an RSS swayamsevak, says that the party hopes that this debate of nationalism should be intensified so much that it can mobilize votes in Assam and Bengal by building public opinion
 chaar main se ye do rajya aise hai jahaan party aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main apana rasta bana sakati he
 The biggest target, however, is Uttar Pradesh where elections are due next year and where BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats in the Lok Sabha
 yahaan kii jeet kaa ek matlab yah bhi hoga ki bharat par centre sarkaar kaa niyantran kaayam he
 Bhupendra Yadav, the party's national general secretary, who drafted the Jan Swabhimaan campaign of the BJP held between 17 and 20 February, told India Today, "we are working on the level of ideology and our principle is Nation First (first Nation)
 ” rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma kehete hai, “ham rashtravirohi gatividhiyon ke samarthakon ko benakaab kar denge
 We will not spare those who talk about the partition of the country

 ”in sab ke bich ek koshish ab bhi jari he ki pradhanmantri ko is bavaal se dur hi rakhaa jaae
 In fact, the manner in which the government arrested the students and then failed to provide concrete evidence has worried some leaders close to Modi
 ve bataate hai ki modi kaa kareebi kunba 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad jeenyu main hue virodh ke vakt se hi khaar khaae hue he
 They were looking for an efficient strategy to expose the leftist agenda to show how they challenged the government's decision to stop funding a handful of foreign-funded ngos
 chunavi yojana se itar doosraa agenda bharat ke saanskrithik or shaikshanik kshetra par niyantran kaayam karne kaa he jiske bare main aresas lambey samay se maanata rahaa he ki us par vamapanthiyon or udaarpanthiyon kaa kabja rahaa he
 The government seems to have given the RSS an open leeway on this issue and the appointment of persons supporting its agenda in FTII, CBFC and ICHR are examples of this capture attempt
 yah sab “hindu raashtra” ke vyapak lakshya or ek nai “aadhyatmik vyavastha” ke aresas ke agenda main feet baithta he jo un “gyaan ke jalaashyon” ko punerjeevit kar degaa jo 500 saal se zyada ke mughal or angreji raaj ke dauraan “nakli samskruti” ke nirmaan ke chalate suukh gaye the
 RSS sources say that they see the NDA government as a good opportunity to take the scheme forward as it has a clear majority in the Lok Sabha and the odds of coalition politics are almost absent
 yah kaam ve 1998 se 2004 ke bich endie ke pehle kaarykaal main nahin kar paae the
 One of the reasons for this was that the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not so committed towards it and secondly, he did not have the majority force like today
 aresas kii chaatr ikai akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ko modi kii satta se saahas praapt hua he or vah desh ke shaikshanik parisaron main apni dhak jamaa rahi he
 This is evident in the 2014 protests against the four-year undergraduate course at Delhi University, the Vemula incident in Hyderabad and now the JNU case
 haalia ghatana ko abivipi duusare sansthaanon ko nishaanaa banane ke ek avasar ke rup main dekh rahi he jinhen yaa to muslim samarthak yaa vam samarthak mana jaataa he, jaise aligarh muslim uniwarsity, jamiya millia islamia or osmania uniwarsity
 Last October, RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said in his address on Dussehra, "the three faiths - Hindu culture, Hindu ancestry and Hindu land - that unite our society must be established
 sangh isi ke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 In this way any result can be produced
 yahi mauka he
 In a 2009 article on the benefits of nationalism for India Today, Sunil Khilnani said, "we need to explain a nationalism that progresses on the basis of its organization, not on the basis of attribution; That which is to be added, not to be sorted; Which reaffirms our basic political principles except for the wandering search of essential categories of identity (country, ethnicity, religion, blood)
 ”asahmati banaam loktantrjeenyu agar kai dashakon se dakshinpanthi bauddhikon ke nishane par he, to isliye kyonki vah pahchaan se jude visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf khadaa rahaa he
 The structure of the entire education system of our country, this university is able to stand against it in many ways
 apane bacchon kaa skulon main pravesh karaane vaale mata-pita ko achche se pataa hota he ki vahaan ank pranali kaise kaam karti he-unki shaikshanik yogyata ko, aay ko, rashtriya or rajya str par mili puraskaron ko, skool se unke nivas kii nikatataa vagairah ko praathamikta di jaati he
 JNU is the exact opposite
 yahaan chaatro ko nichali jati kaa hone, aarthik rup se vanchit hone, parisar se nivas sthaan kii duuri or mata-pita ke hyskool paas na hone ko tarjeeh di jaati he
 In this sense, JNU is a natural balancing act that encourages students who can improve their future only by being educated
 ye chaatr dur-dur se aate hai or barabari se raashtra nirmaan jaise academik vishyon par bahason main bhaag le pate hai
 For example, Kanhaiya hails from Behat village in Begusarai, Bihar; His father Jaishankar could not complete his tenth standard and his mother Meena Devi is an Anganwadi worker
 jeenyu ke isi vividh chaatrbal ke kaaran yahaan jo shodh hote hai or jo patr-patrikaayen yahaan se nikalati hai, unhone vibhinn kshetron ko bahut vistaar se khangaalane kaa kaam kiya he or desh ke samaksh maujuud samasyaon kaa vaastavik chithran kiya he
 Studying from JNU is not just an issue of dialogue with people from one section, but it is a dialogue that has spread throughout the country
 bhartiya vichaarkon, vidwaanon or naukarshahon kii anupatik rup se ek badi khep kabhi na kabhi jeenyu main yaa uske saath sambhddha rahi he, isiilie uske udaar vampanthi mulya bahusankhyakwaadi bharat ke dakshinpanthi vichaaron ke sidhe taur par virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 That is why from the perspective of the rest of India, suppression of those thoughts means to directly attack the snake's fun
 magar modi sarkaar or sangh parivaar ko apana agenda aage badhaane ke liye yah makul lagata he
 The question however is also on the concept of disagreement in a democracy
 jaisaa ki jeenyu main arthshaastra ke professor surojit majumdaar kehete hai, kya hamen yah maananaa padegaa ki rashtrawaad kii aapaki avadharana hi iklauti he? agar vah avadharana yah kahati he ki rajdroh ke dar se rajyasatta se kabhi sawaal nahin poocha janaa chahie, to phir loktantr kii avadharana kya he? kya loktantr vah jagah nahin jahaan kisi ko rajya par sawaal khadaa karne kii aazaadee ho? ve kehete hai, “iskaa matlab aap mujhase yah kah rahe hai ki ek aaazaad desh main tum vastav main aaazaad nahin ho
 Should our nationalism be the one that resolves to address the problems and resolve it or should it go blind from the problem itself? ”rajendra Mathur Memorial Lecture held on 12 February by the Editors Guild of India Speaking on the central importance, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised one such question, "calm the disagreements and instill fear in people's minds
" Da is in violation of the essential terms of personal freedom and makes it difficult to communicate based democratic society

 The special thing is that the allowance of Rs 50 for keeping a good mustache has now been increased to Rs 250
 upi piesi aise jawan jinaki moonchhen shandaar hongi unako khaas maukon par alag se sammanit bhi karegaa
 PAC officers have been issued a written order by the department to enhance this tradition, which says that the officers should encourage the soldiers to grow mustache in the jawans so that more and more jawans start keeping robe mustache

 This has been said in a report

 The next meeting of the GST Council will be held on 18 June when it will look into the lottery tax and the e-way bill
 ikraa-asocham ne ek sanyukt report main kaha, 'oil evam gas udyog ko vartmaan kar vyavastha or jiesti donon kaa anupaalan karnaa hoga, jisase us par dohari anupaalan laagat aegi
 The reason is that five petroleum products - crude oil, natural gas, motor spirits, high capacity diesel and aviation turbine fuel have been exempted from GST, while LPG, naphtha, kerosene, fuel oil etc
 have been included in GST '

 icra-assocham said in a joint report, 'the oil and gas industry will have to comply with both the current tax regime and GST, which will lead to double compliance costs
 uski vajah yah he ki paanch petroleum utpaadon- kaccha tel, prakritik gas, motor spirit, ucch kshamta vaala dijal or vimaanan terbine eendhan ko jiesti se mukt rakhaa gaya he, jabaki alpiji, nephtha, kerosine, eendhan tel aadi jiesti main shaamil kiye gaye hai'

 (IANS) Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi is well aware that it is almost impossible for him to defeat Sneh Bansal in the election of DDCA President to be held on December 30 but he is not going to back down without fighting against the 'shameful activities' of the incumbent
 is
 bedi ne chunaav se purv patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, 'yadi aap bhrashtachar ke maamle main dekhe to didisie main jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he, use kab tak bardaasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Do you want this kind of atmosphere in the famous center of Test in the country
 ' Apart from Bedi, former India cricketer and Delhi giants Madan Lal, Kirti Azad, Surinder Khanna and Clean Sports India coordinator BVP Rao were also present on the occasion
 ioe main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf lard rahe raav ne bedi or aaazaad kaa samarthan kiya
 Bedi was also asked questions about his meeting with Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi's future Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which he called a courtesy call
 unhone kaha, 'arvindji jo bade paimaane par kar rahe hai, vahi ham chote str par kar rahe hai lekin mul lakshya samaan he
 Remove corruption that has penetrated the roots
 ' In the Ranji Trophy, the issue of holding Delhi home matches at the Roshanara ground also came up and Bedi said that his fight is not against Gautam Gambhir but against the officials
 unhone kaha, 'ek khilaadi ke taur par match jeetne ke liye main gautam kii bekaraari samaj saktaa hum, lekin khilaadiyon or adhikariyon ke bich samvaad bilkul nahin he
 Are the DDCA officials also desperate to win a Ranji match like the players
 kya sahvaag or gautam jaise khilaadiyon kii baat suni jaati he
 ' bedi kii penal maujuuda padaadhikariyon ke khilaaf ladegi jin par nivruthman adhyaksh or bhaajapa netaa arun jetali kaa varahadast he
 Bedi knows that there is little chance of victory, because in DDCA, there is a lot of indirect voters
 aaazaad ne kaha, 'bishan bedi jaise ko paroksh maton ke sahare jeetne kii jarurat nahin he
 Our goal is to eradicate this 'proxy culture' from DDCA
 hamen ummid he ki yah jarur hoga

 (from input language) trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee 19 janvari ko kolkata main ek mega raily karne ja rahi hai
 All the opposition parties have been invited for this rally
 mana ja rahaa he ki is raily main vipakshi dalon kaa sabase bada jamaavada hoga kyonki khud mamata banerjee bataa chuki hai ki desh kaa shaayad hi koi vipakshi netaa ho jise aamantran na diya gaya ho
 Mamta Banerjee, 'many leaders in the rally such as Sharad Yadav, Stalin from DMK, Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, N
 of Telugu Desam
 chandrababu naidu, aap ke arvind kejariwal, janata dal es se echdi kumaraswami, congress ke mallikarjun khadge shaamil honge
 This will be an important front of the fight against BJP
 ' mamata banerjee ke ginaae in naamon main teen pramukh naam gaayab hai
 These names are Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati
 mallikarjun khadge ke aane se saaf he ki sonia, rahul raily main hissaa nahin lenge
 Also Mayawati will not attend the rally
 donon apane-apane pradeshon ke kshatrapamayawati or mamata banerjee donon kshatrap hai
 Both of them have a significant support base in their respective states
 haalanki pichley kuch chunaavon main mayawati kaa graph bhale neeche gaya he lekin dalit vot par unki acchhee pakad he
 Mayawati's specialty has also been that she does not like going to rallies where she is not at the center
 mayawati ko jald kisi ke saath manch saajha karte hue nahin dekha jaataa kyonki unki raajnneeti 'ekakshatra' vaali rahi he
 If she also shares the stage then she dominates there
 mamata banerjee agar duusari baar pashchim bengal kii siem bani hai to mayawati 4 baar upi kii siem rah chuki hai
 Political critics believe that one of the reasons for Mamta not attending the rally could also be that the BSP cadre is not strong there
 vahaan se na to party kaa koi vidhayak he na hi koi saansad
 Mayawati's name has also cropped up in the PM claim, so in many ways she looks heavier than Mamata Banerjee
 is lihaaj se mamata banerjee ke manch par mayawati kaa janaa siyaasi sameekaran main feet nahin baithta
 Suddenly Mayawati has come to the center: The election of BSP mlas in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh elections and the alliance with Samajwadi Party has brought Mayawati to the center
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki sapa pramukh mayawati ko zyada tavajjo de rahe hai
 One thing came out in the SP-BSP alliance that 'UP has always been giving the Prime Minister', so can give it this time too
 iskaa arth he ki desh ke sabase ahm pradesh upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne apana piem ummidavaar tay kar liya he or yah naam mayawati kaa he
 Mamta Banerjee has to get the attention that Mayawati has achieved in West Bengal
 kyonki mamata kaa gathbandhan abhi congress se nahin ho paaya he
 Whether Congress Mamata's party will go with All India Trinamool Congress or with CPM is not yet decided
 gathbandhan main congress nahin, kya he iskaa sanketamayawati-akhilesh kii jodi ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress ko shaamil na karne laayak samajha to iskaa ishaara spasht he
 Recalling DMK leader Stalin, a section of the opposition has considered Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate
 aise main kisi waisi party ko shaamil karne kaa kya auchity jo pehle se apni daavedaari siddh kar chuki ho
 Mamta's rally is a rally of the opposition, so in the absence of Gandhi family on the stage, it is bound to raise questions on the PM face of the Grand Alliance
 udhar mamata banerjee pehle hi kah chuki hai ki piem koun banegaa is par loksabhaa chunaav baad faisla hoga
 The Trinamool president has told in a way that neither Rahul Gandhi nor any other leader will be named
 lihaaja sonia, rahul or mayawati ko mamata kii raily se dur rahanaa hi zyada munasib lag rahaa he

 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder)february 28, 2019bharat ke sakht rukh ke aage pakistan ne 30 ghante ke andar kiya elaanbharat ne aisa sakht rukh apanaaya ki pakistan ke piem imran khan ko 30 ghante ke bheetar hi elaan karnaa padaa ki bhartiya payalat ko bina shart reeha kiya jayega
 Today Wing Commander Abhinandan is returning to his native country, while the whole country is praising Abhinandan
 jaankaree ke mutabik videsh mantralay ne pakistan ko saaf kar diya tha ki bagaiyr kisi chot ke payalat kii jald rihaai honi chahie, saudebaaji kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 India is not demanding consular access but is demanding immediate release
 pakistan ko chetavanee bhare lahaze bharat ne kaha tha ki agar payalat ko kuch hua, to wo ection ke liye taiyaar rahe
 It is a pleasure for India that Pilot Abhinandan will return home safely today
 pakistan ne kii saudebaaji kii koshishhaalanki, wing commander abhinandan kii rihaai kaa elaan karne se pehle pakistan ne jamkar saudebaaji kaa sanket diya tha
 Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Dr
 Muhammad Faizal had said that the Indian pilot is safe and sound in the possession of Pakistan
 bharat ne hamase payalat kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 In a few days, we will decide which treaty will apply to it and whether the Indian pilots should be given wartime status or not

 Thirteen days after this, in retaliation, India penetrated inside Pakistan and demolished the Jaish terror bases
 iske baad pakistan ne bhi airstrike kii koshish kii, lekin bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke vimaanon ko khaded diya or ek vimaan ko maar giraaya
 During this time our mig-21 also crashed and wing commander Abhinandan landed safely in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 iske baad pakistan army ne unhen bandi bana liya
 The banned lashkar-e-taiba organization, which carried out the terrorist attacks on Mumbai from the soil of Pakistan, is fully ready to attack India once again
 khufia agenciyon se jude adhikariyon kaa hawala dete hue america media kii ek report main yah baat kahi gai he
 Lashkar's network in Pakistan, The New York Times has reported that Pakistan's all promises to destroy terrorist organizations from its land after 180 innocent people were killed by ten terrorists in Mumbai on 26 November last year
 And despite the arrest of many mobsters, the lashkar-e-taiba continues to thrive
 karachi main prashikshan mila tha mumbai ke hamalaavaron komumbai hamale kii jaanch ko lekar jari kiye kiye bharat or pakistan ke dogier se paak main faile lashkar ke network kaa vistrut byoraa miltaa he
 According to these documents found in the newspaper, four houses in Karachi and two training camps were used to carry out the Mumbai attacks
 lashkar phir se hamalaa kar saktaa halmerica europe or pakistan ke khufia adhikariyon or lashkar ke aatankwaadiyon ke hawaale se akhbaar likhata he ki lashkar apane vistrut network ke jariye kam sansadhano ke istemaal se hi kisi bhi aatanki karrwai ko turant anjaam de saktaa he
 The report said that Lashkar's network remains alive despite being dormant and the possibility that it could attack India again makes Lashkar a wild card in this most turbulent region of the world

 With the change of government in Uttar Pradesh, the color of festivals has started changing
 pichhali sarkaar main jahaan saifai mahotsav chaaya rahata tha to yogi sarkaar main gorakhpur mahotsav kii charchaa rahi
 The Taj Mahotsav, which starts in Agra from February 18, is in the news
 hindutv ke agenda par aage badhate hue yogi sarkaar mughaliya rangath main najar aane vaale taj mahotsav ko is baar bhagava rang main rangane kii taiyaari main he
 Wow not Taj, Jayshree Ram, actually according to the events that have been organized in the Taj festival, this time the image of Lord Ram will be shown on the stage in the beginning of the Taj festival
 ramlila ke jariye tretayug ko darshaya jayega
 So far, when people coming from all over the country and the world look at the Taj Mahal, just two words come out of their tongue, wow Taj
 lekin do hafte baad 18 farvari ko jo log yahaan maujuud honge unke munh se vaah taj nahin balki jai shriram nikalegaa
 Yes, up's famous Taj Mahotsava is starting on 18 February
 pehali baar taj mahotsav main bhagwaan kii chhavi najar aegi kyonki mahotsav kaa aagaaj shriram bhartiya kala centre kii prastuti se hoga, jisamen bhagwaan ram ke saare rup muktakashiya manch par dikhenge
 For the first time, the Tretayug will not be seen for the first time, till now the Taj Mahotsav had a glimpse of the Mughal period, but this time the festival organized on the heritage theme will have the impression of the first-time government
 mahotsav ke liye upi ke rajyapal or mukhyamantri yogi ko bhi diya nyauta diya gaya he
 Like all times, this time Bollywood stars will participate here
 videshi kalakaar bhi manch par pararform karenge
 The officers engaged in making the ruler happy, now that the rulers of the state have changed, then the officers are also trying to spare no effort to make them happy
 isiilie mughaliya shaano-shaukat ke bare main bataane vaale taj mahotsav main is baar ram naam kii gunj rahegi
 The devotion of UP CM Yogi Adityanath is not hidden from anyone
 siem banane ke baad se wo kai baar ayodhya aa chuke hai
 He also organized a grand Ram Puja on Diwali
 aise main bada sawaal ye he ki taj mahotsav par bhagwaan ram kii chhap kya yogi sarkaar ke usagendake vistaar he, jiske tahat upi main sarkari bhawanon ko bhagava rang main ranga ja rahaa he
 How far will the impact of Jayshree Ram's echoing government change the color of schools after government buildings? had to tab ho gai jab lakhanu ke haj house kaa rang bhi bhagava kar diya gaya
 However, later, the government pulled out of the entire episode, firing at some people
 lekin ab taj mahotsav main jayshriram kii gunj kahaan tak asar karegi, ye vakt batayega
 At present, the administration of Agra is busy in the preparations to saffronize the Taj Mahotsav
 ye he mahotsav kaa puraa kaarykramtaj mahotsav aayojan samiti ke mutabik 18 farvari ko shriram bharti kala centre kii ore se bhagwaan shriram par aadhaarit nrity naatika ke manchan ke saath kaarykram kaa aagaaj hoga

 On 22 February, Pune's Black and White group will present a program based on old songs, while Mushaira on 23 February and Kavi Sammelan on 24 February

 Hot Pink also represents the modern Indian woman
 
 
 agar koi alag va dilachasp tareeke se sindur lagaana chahta he, to yah aisa karne kaa behatar tarika he

 mumbai hamale ke gunahagaar most wanted aatanki hafiz said ke aatanki sanghathan jamaat ud daawa ne apana naam badal liya he
 This decision to change the name of Jamaat-ud Dawa has taken place almost a week after the detention of Hafiz Saeed
 sanghathan kaa naam badalakar taharik e aazaadee jammu-kashmir (tiageke) rakh liya gaya he
 Saeed had indicated about a week before his detention that he could start Tehreek-e-independence Jammu and Kashmir to intensify the movement for independence of Kashmir
 isse pataa lagata he ki said ko sarkaar kii yojana kii bhanak thi or usne pehle hi tay kar liya tha ki jamaat ud daawa (jeyudi) or falaah e insaaniyat foundation (exef) par karrwai ke baad dobaaraa kaise saamne aana he or kis tarah sanghathan ko banaae rakhana he

 Leader of Opposition Singh issued a statement saying that women and girls are being looted every day in the state and the police is not ready to listen to the victims
 gwalior main to police ne ek peedita se dushkarm kaa saboot tak maang daalaa or aakhir main peedit yuvati ne jaan dena hi behatar samajha
 He said that suicide by a victim woman in Gwalior is not the first case
 mukhyamantri sihore jile se vidhansabha chunaav jeet kar aate us jile main saat farvari ko ek dalit chaatra ne isliye aatmahatya kar lee thi, kyonki police ne report ke baavjood aropiyon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii
 a similar case is the case of Vidisha, the parliamentary constituency of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, where a minor was forced to commit suicide due to molestation
 rajgad jile main report likhaane ke do maah baad bhi karrwai na hone par vivaahita ne khudakushi kii
 The National Women's Commission has blamed the police for such an incident in Betul

 In Shivpuri, four sisters have complained to the Superintendent of Police four times that they are being pressured to carry out the act, but the police did not take any action

 3 When you return home after a day's fatigue, you will not feel anything other than bed
 chaiyn kii neend lene ke bare main sochakar jaise hi aap bistar par jate honge kuch der baad hi aapke sharir main khujali shuru ho jaati hogi
 Many times it will also happen that when you wake up in the morning, you will see red rash or rash all over your body
 agar aapane dhyaan diya hoga to aapako samaj aa jayega ki ye laal dane ek pattern main hai
 Actually, these are nothing but bedbugs hidden in your bed
 khatmal he kya?khatmal chote paraseete hote hai jo bistar or gaddon main punap jate hai
 They are reddish-brown and flattened
 ye paraseete insaanon kaa khun pikar jinda rahete hai
 a female bedbug lays two hundred to four hundred eggs throughout her lifetime
 kaise panpate hai khatmal?khatmal gandagi main panpane vaala keet he
 For many days, they thrive due to not showing sunlight to the bed, due to dampness and dirt
 iske liye jaruri he kibistar ko samay-samay par dhoop dikhaate rahen
 How to know if you have bed bugs? -if you wake up in the morning after getting up, you get itchy and see rashes, then you may have bed bugs
 -kisi keet ke kaate ke nishaan aapako saaf najar aaenge or ye sankhya main bahut adhik honge
 - Rusty mark may be seen on your clothes
 -agar infections bahut adhik he to saktaa he ki aapke sharir se badboo bhi aae
 Take away bed bugs from these home remedies: - Clean the pits and sheets from time to time and also show them sunlight
 -vaikum clinar se gaddon kii safai karnaa bhi asardaar rahegaa
 - If you suspect that you have bed bugs, then dip a piece of cotton in alcohol and rub it on the mattresses
 -agar furniture main kahin daraar he to use turant thik karvaa len
 - Put neem leaves on the mattress
 rashtriya chayansmiti ke adhyaksh krishnaamchaaree shrikant ne sweekaar kiya he ki bhartiya cricket team england daure ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar nahin thi lekin unhone kaha ki is haar ke liye chayankartaaon ko doshi tehraana sahi nahin hoga
 The Indian team is looking for the first win so far in the England tour
 test shrinkhalaa main 0-4 se parajeet hone ke baad use twanti-20 or mangalvaar ko duusare ekadivasiy match main bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Srikanth said, 'you can say that we were not fully prepared
 kuch khilaadi westeindies se sidhe vahaan pahunche
 The conditions in England are slightly different, but the ICC FTP (future tour program) was decided long ago and even BCCI could do nothing about it
 ’bharat ne daure main apni number ek test ranking bhi ganvaayi lekin shrikant iske khilaadiyon kii aalochana karne or chayankartaaon par haar kaa dosha madhne ke khilaaf hai
 He said, 'when things go wrong, then it makes no sense to blame
 yah ekmaatr shrinkhalaa rahi jisamen hamaare anukool kuch bhi nahin hua
 Why are you blaming the selectors for this defeat? ’shrikant ne kaha, ‘bharat 20 maheene tak number ek team rahaa
 We beat New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies on their soil and four years ago England was also beaten on its soil but this time nothing was favorable to us
 ’ shrikant ne sweekaar kiya ki yuva ballebaaj suresh raina ko short pich gendon ko khilne main pareshaani hoti he lekin yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki bharat kii ‘bench strenth’ kamjor he
 The former Indian captain said, "raina will have to improve his technique especially in front of short pitch balls in Test matches
 lekin main is baat se sahamat nahin hum ki hamaari bench strength kamjor he
 This is the process
 pichley kuch varshon main jin yuva khilaadiyon ko mauka mila unhone acha pradarshan kiya
 Srikanth also defended the selection of injured players like Zaheer Khan and Virender Sehwag
 unhone kaha, ‘team kaa sahvaag or jahir kii jarurat thi
 These players also thought they could try
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jahaan tak sahvaag kaa sawaal he to hamen sweekaar karnaa chahie ki usne apni taraf se sarvshereshth prayaas kiya lekin use laga ki vah puri tarah se feet nahin he
 You do what the experts tell you, but after reaching there, he felt that he would not be able to walk
 desh ko uski jarurat thi
 He actually put the country up
 use laga ki desh ko uski sevaaon kii jarurat he
 Srikkanth is likely to be retained in the post again but refused to say anything on it
 unhone kaha, ‘yah mere or board ke bich kaa masalaa he
 Such issues, like selection, are also not publicly discussed
 yah board kaa faisla hoga lekin hamen kuch dinon main pataa chal janaa chahie
 ' pichley hafte garmi se raahat ke baad ab garmi asar dikhaane lagi he

 But in the meantime, the second T20 match at the cricket ground in Rajkot saw the most ups and downs, and finally Team India lost by 40 runs
 haar to tabhi tay ho gai thi jab viraat kohli ko wicket gira tha
 However, after Virat Kohli's dismissal, Mahendra Singh Dhoni tried his best to win Team India
 lekin ek lanbaa shot lagane ke chakkar main unhone apana wicket gavaan die
 
 
 
 to berthde jashn ho jaataa dugunarazkot tii-20 match vaise to nirnaayak nahin tha, bhale hi is match ko jitkar newjiland ne siries main 1-1 kii barabari kar lee he
 But if Team India had won this match, it would have been the biggest birthday gift from the team to captain Virat Kohli
 kyonki 5 november ko captain viraat kohli kaa berthde he or is jeet ne berthde jashn duguna ho jaataa, saath hi tii-20 siries par bhi bharat kaa kabja ho jaataa
 Now the third and last match will be decisive
 40 ran se haar gai team indise match main newjiland ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya or nirdhaarit 20 overon main team india ko jeet ke liye 197 ranon kaa lakshya diya
 Team India, chasing the target, got the first 2 shocks, after which the third wicket fell on the score of 65 runs
 is vakt tak bharat mukaable main bana hua tha
 Kohli himself kept fighting till the last moment, captaining Kohli himself came to bat and took the team out of the initial pressure
 ek vakt ko aisa laga ki khud kohli newjiland se match chhinakar bharat kii jholii main daal denge
 But with a small mistake, his wicket was handed to New Zealand and the stance of the match changed
 kohli 42 gendon main 65 ran banaakar out hue
 Dhoni's attempt also failed in a way that the fall of Kohli's wicket proved to be the turning point of the match and Team India lost the match
 kyonki jis vakt kohli out hue bharat kaa score 16
 There was 123 runs in 3 overs and Dhoni was supporting Kohli at the other end
 shaayad dhoni bhi apane captain ko berthde par gift ye jeet tohfe main dena chaahate the
 But the victory turned into a loss as Kohli was dismissed
 ab tisare match kaa intjarkohli ke baad akshar patel ballebaaji karne aae
 But by the time he was great with his bat, it was too late, and then Dhoni did take some long shots to return to the match
 lekin 49 ran ke nijee score par wo bhi apana kaich thamakar pavilion laut gaye
 In this way, Team India failed to give their captain a 'win' gift on the birthday
 ballebaaj haar ke liye jimmedaarhaalanki is haar se viraat kohli ne team kii ballebaaji ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The captain said, "we could not do well with the bat
 jab aap 200 ranon kaa peechha kar rahe ho to aapke sabhi ballebaajon ko score karnaa hota he yaa kisi ek ballebaaj ko 200 kii strike rate se ran banane hote hai, maine apni puri koshish kii
 Dhoni finally played well, but our work was very difficult
 ' The Indian team may have played the fourth match of the series in an ODI against captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni at his home ground Ranchi, this may be his last match at his own ground
 darasal agle saal june tak ranchi main koi vanade match nahin he
 However, Dhoni has no intention of retiring now
 kyon khaas he siries kaa chauthaa machatim india is match ko jeet leti he to uskaa siries par kabja ho jayega
 For the last two years, Dhoni has been yearning for one-day series victory
 do saalon main dhoni kii sena teen baar siries gavaan chuki he
 The JSCA ground has proved lucky for Team India so far
 yahaan bharat ne koi bhi match nahin gavaaya he
 Playing for the first time after the film's release in Ranchi, much of the film on Dhoni has been shot in Ranchi and its surrounding areas
 dhoni ke is byopic ke madhyam se log apane chahete ranchi ke rajkumaar ke jivan se sambandhit ke anjaane pahaluon ko bhi dekha
 After the release of this film proved to be a super hit, Dhoni is playing in Ranchi for the first time
 logon ko ummid he ki isbaar dhoni phir se chauthe number par utar kar apni ballebaaji kaa johar dikhaaenge

 In this post, Anushka Sharma has expressed her anger that she will not let her name get caught in any controversy related to Indian cricket
 darasal, bhartiya cricket team ke purv wicket keeper farrukh ejeeniyar (farokh Engineer) ne 'times of india' ko diye intervyuu main daawa kiya tha ki world cap 2019 ke dauraan cricket team ke silectors ne anoushka sharma ko chaay parosi thi

 com / joynfhremm Anushka Sharma, replying to Farokh Engineer in her post, wrote, "my opinion on how to deal with concocted and fake news is, keep quiet and let the critics speak
" isi prakaar maine apane 11 saal ke kariyar main chijen sanbhali hai
 i always see truth standing in the shadow of my silence
 vah jhooth ko bhi itani baar bolte hai ki vah bhi aakhir main sach lagane lagata he or mujhe is baat kaa dar he ki mere saath aakhir kya ho rahaa he
 It is because of my silence that the lies spoken to me have started turning into truth, but today it will end
 main hameshaa se chup rahati ai hum
 i kept quiet even when i was held responsible for my husband Virat Kohli's performance
 iske alaava bhi cricket se judi kai chizon ke liye bhi meraa naam shaamil kiya gaya
 My name was also taken in those stories, that i used to participate in the meetings of the cricket team held in closed rooms and the selection of the team is affected because of me
 "apni post main anoushka sharma (anushka Sharma) ne aage likhaa, meraa naam us samay bhi galat tareeke se prayog kiya gaya, jab kaha gaya ki main apane pati ke saath videshi daure par zyada vakt gujaarti hum
 But if i pay attention to the facts, i have always followed all the protocols
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki board mere liye tikat or suraksha kaa intejaam karata he, jabaki sachai yah he ki match or flite kii tikat main khud kharidti hum
 Now the latest lie that is being spread among all of them is that the selectors served me tea in the World Cup 2019
 main world cap main ek game main ai hum or family box main baithi hum, silectors ke saath nahin
 If you have to question your selectors and their qualifications, get involved with hobbies, but don't drag my name into it
 lekin, main in chizon main apana naam kisi ko bhi nahin laane duungi
 Anushka Sharma said, "it is not that i have only had trouble with this news and i have broken my silence
 har baar mujhe itnaa hi kharaab lagata he
 Therefore, do not consider my letter as the answer to the news
 maine aaj bolne kaa faisla kiya, kyonki kisi kii chuppi ko kabhi uski kamajori nahin samajhnaa chahie
 You have to run your agenda, criticize someone, even if you want to criticize my husband, do it with facts and evidence
 par mujhe baksh den
 i have made my career on my own and i will not compromise with anyone for this thing
 kuch logon ko yah baat bhale hi hajam na ho, lekin main ek swatantra mahila hum or ek cricketer kii bivi bhi hum
 And for the record let me say that i drink coffee

 Kumar Vishwas said that after so many years of freedom in democracy, such people may be killed on the road due to group, caste, religion and choice of food and food, but the blood of political parties is the blood of seasoned leaders only to weigh on events is
 kumaar ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi kaa khun churaasi kii ghatnaon se kholana chahie tha yaa tab se unke parivaar kaa khun kholana shuru ho jaae jis tarah se sadak par logon ko maaraa gaya
 He said that Manmohan, the then Prime Minister of the country, had given a statement that if the first right on the natural resources of the country is of the minorities, then at that time blood should be opened
 tab priyanka ko kahana chahie tha ki yah ek ajeeb bayaan he or desh sabake liye samaan he
 Taking a dig at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Kumar said, "I am happy to note that the two siblings have split the time interval that their blood will bloom in July and their blood will bloom in June
" vahanani ke ghar hai to unka khun lautakar kholegabich main inkaa khul rahaa he
 According to Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas, the seasonal politics that the Congress is doing to its crown prince and a very gentle woman, it is less likely to come into the role of permanent opposition

 swami prasad maury or brijesh pathak ke aane se party majboot hogi
 But they should not give tickets or any big post to the party
 agar aisa hoga to ham log samuhik istipha denge
 'saharanpur:' Leader from other party is like Sautan ', former BJP MLA in Saharanpur and member of National Executive of Party Kisan Morcha, Shashibala Pundir described the leaders coming from other parties as BJP workers
 unhone kaha, 'koun mahila chaahegi ki uske ghar main koi sautan aae
 But if the husband also brings soutan to increase the home and family, then he should accept it
 ''ham ajam or amar kii tarah nahin'unhone amar singh or ajam khan ko sautan bataate hue kaha ki hamaari party main aane vaali sautanen samaajawaadee party kii sautanon se bahut acchhee hai
 She does not abuse each other like sp's Amar Singh and Azam Khan
 bijepi main sabhi ko niyam kanoon ke daayre main rahanaa padataa he
 Regarding giving the ticket to the leaders of other parties by cutting the ticket of the old BJP leaders, he said that it is very bad
 swami prasad morya ke vishay main shashibala pundir ne kaha ki unhen bijepi main aane ke baad party kii nitiyon par chalanaa hoga
 Just like he used to treat the upper caste people in the BSP, if he did this behavior with BJP workers then he would not tolerate and would be opposed
 yani ishaara saaf he ki saheli bananaa he to sautan ko niti-niyam apnaane honge
 Lady Dabangg is like image Shashibala Pundir has been a strong student leader of Lucknow University
 1991 main vah bijepi main shaamil hui thim
 Sugarcane farmers have gone to jail many times during the strike
 1993-95 main saharanpur kii devband vidhansabha se vidhayak kaa chunaav jitkar vidhayak baniin
 In this election she was the MLA winning the most votes in West Uttar Pradesh
 2012 ke chunaav main unhen phir se devband se tikat diya gaya, lekin namakan se ek din pehle unka devband se tikat katkar unhe gangoh kaa tikat diya gaya, jahaan vah chunaav haar gayi
 Shashibala Pundir is seen as a domineering politician in Saharanpur politics
 bahari banaam bhitari kii rassakhsibahari banaam bhitari ke kaaran jitna respons swami prasad maury ko bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon se milanaa chahie, wo nahin mil rahaa
 Last week in Meerut, there was Swami Prasad Maurya and Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on the same day
 lekin bijepi ke donon kaarykram main ek main khachaakhach bheed rahi, jabaki swami prasad maury ke kaarykram main kursiyaan khaali raheen
 Swami Prasad Maurya, who had left the Netabahujan Samaj Party who was absent from Maurya's program in Meerut, joined the BJP recently when he arrived in Meerut
 lihaaja, raily sthal par maury ko sunne vaale adhiktar log ja chuke the
 The chairs were lying vacant and local BJP leaders were also missing from the assembly
 meerut main sabase badi baat ye dikhi ki meerut mandal ke bijepi netaaon ne kaarykram se kinaaraa kiya hua tha
 Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore was present in Meerut from day one
 ek din main do-do netaaon ke meerut main program or donon ko ek duusare kii jaankaree nahin thi
 Even BJP leaders did not reach to meet Swami
 baharhaal bijepi bhale hi is baat se utsahit ho ki unki party main aane waalon ne party daftar ke baahar line laga rakhi he, lekin bijepi ko bihar kii tarah kaa khatra yahaan bhi mandaraata dikh rahaa he ki agar tikat daavedaaron kii taadaat kaaphi ho gai, to use haraane waalon kii fehrist bhi lambii ho jaaegi

 a petition was filed in this regard in the Supreme Court of the country
 supreme court ne guuruuvaar ko is yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar kar diya
 An association of Christians requested the court to list their petition immediately
 yachika main tamilnadu evam puducheri main matdaan kii taarikh 18 april main badlaav karne kaa anurodh karte hue kaha tha ki yah chunaav kii taarikh badali jaae kyonki yah good friday or easter ke bich pad rahi he
 Counsel for the petitioner, appearing for the bench, said that the voting date is between Good Friday and Easter, so a new date should be set for it
 is par supreme court ke nyaayamurti ese bobade ne yachikakarta ke vakil se poocha ki kya aap kisi pavitra din par matdaan nahin kar sakate? or 'ham aapako yah salaah nahin dena chaahate ki prarthana kaise karen or matdaan kaise karen
 Saying this, the court refused to hear the petition
 tyohaar ke kaaran matdaan kii taarikh badalane kii yah pehali guhaar nahin he
 Many political parties objected to the dates of Lok Sabha elections during Ramadan month, political parties claimed that due to Ramadan month, Muslims would go for lesser number of votes and BJP would benefit from it
 jis ovaisi ne kaha yah puraa vivaad gairajaruri bataaya thakyon khaas he good frideisai samudaay ke liye good friday khaas din hota he
 The sacrifice of Lord Jesus is 'good Friday' this time on 30 March
 yah isai samudaay kaa pramukh tyohaar he
 It is said that on this day itself, the Lord Jesus Christ gave the supreme example of selfless love by sacrificing for his devotees
 prabhu yishu ne suuli par chadhakar prem or kshamaa kaa sandesh diya tha
 This day is also known as Holy Friday, Black Friday or Great Friday
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki prabhu yishu ko is baat kaa pehle hi ehsaas ho gaya tha
 Therefore, 40 days before Good Friday, Jesus started the fast
 yah isa ke punarutthan ke teen din purv padane vaale shuukravaar ko good friday ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, devotees pray and meditate with fasting
 is dauraan shraddhalu prabhu yishu dwaara teen ghante tak cross par bhogi gai pidaa ko yaad karte hai
 Wearing black robes at night, devotees take out a ceremony celebrating mourning by taking the image of Jesus and symbolically performing their last rites
 chunki good friday praayshchitt or prarthana kaa din he
 Therefore, bells are not played in churches on this day
 is baar punjab main rajnatik partiyon ke bich ghamaasan machane vaala he kyonki chunaav ayog ne chunaav prachaar ke liye unhen ab tak kaa sabase kam samay diya he
 On January 30, 1,74,33,408 voters are about to lock the fortunes of candidates of various parties into voting machines
 uttar pradesh ke mahaasangram ke bich bhi punjab kaa chunaav behad mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 84-year-old Parkash Singh Badal, Punjab's longest-serving and four-time chief minister of the state, has announced that this will be his last electoral battle
 lekin janata kaa faisla yah tay karegaa ki unke iklaute bete or rajnatik uttaradhikari up-mukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal apane pita kii viraasat sambhaal paaenge yaa nahin
 Regarding Sukhbir, 49, who was the de facto chief minister for at least three years, experts say that if he wants to retain the leadership of the Shiromani Akali Dal, he will have to win this election
 lekin up-mukhyamantri ke liye khel bigaadane kaa kaam unke 49 varshiya chachere bhai manpreet singh badal kar rahe hai
 In October 2010, he severed ties with the Akali Dal due to differences with Sukhbir and Parkash Singh Badal in October 2010
 mana jaataa he ki is matbhed kii mukhya vajah uttaradhikaar kii ladaai hi rahi he
 Then in March, Manpreet formed his own party called the People's Party of Punjab
 samajha ja rahaa he ki yah nai party punjab ke malwa kshetra yani dakshin or dakshin-pashchim garh main shiromani akali dal (esaidi) kaa khel bigaad sakati he
 In a state where governments are alternating alternately like wheat and paddy crops, the Punjab Congress, led by former chief minister 69-year-old Captain Amarinder Singh, is hopeful of making a comeback in 2012
 esaidi-bhaajapa ke kushasan, vaade puraa na karne or apni party ke logon ke khilaaf rajnatik dushmani nibhaane kaa aarope lagaate hue amarinder singh kehete hai, ''satta main badal pita-putr kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 But the Congress may get a shock especially in the urban areas, where a large number of lower middle class educated people are resentful of rising inflation, corruption, scandals and the Center's mistreatment of Anna Hazare

 But taking no risk, the Badal government was engaged in the transfers of police officers and officers throughout the whole of December for fear of election code
 23 disambar ko chunaav tarikhon kii ghoshnaa se thik ek din pehle iees or punjab civil seva ke 24 adhikariyon ke tabadale kiye gaye
 Some police officers were also transferred in the same manner
 haalanki chunaav ayog ne kuch tabadalon ko nirast kar diya
 The decision to abolish tariffs on petrol and diesel an hour before the election code has also been put on hold
 chunaav ayog puri sakhti barat rahaa he
 Hundreds of crores were raided at many places in the state

 Both the ruling SAD-BJP alliance and the opposition Congress are confident of their victory
 apni party ke prachaar kii aguai karte hue sukhbir badal daawa karte hai ki unki party agle 25 saal tak raaj karti rahegi, jabaki amarinder singh apane virodhiyon ko dhul chataane kii baat karte hai
 In such a situation, the people of Punjab are going to experience political heat even in the bitter cold due to fierce slogans and throwing mud at each other
 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar 'saifai mahotsav' karti rahi he, ab bijepi sarkaar gorakhpur main teen divasiy 'gorakhpur mahotsav' karne ja rahi he

 The NCP has condemned the Yogi government's move and termed it as a highly irresponsible and inhuman act of a 'shameless government'
 ensipi ne yogi sarkaar ke is faisle ko pichley dinon gorakhpur sthit baba raghavdas medical college main agast ke maheene main 290 bacchon kii maut par jashn jaisaa qaraar diya he
 Speaking to the media for the first time after being nominated as an MP, Sachin Tendulkar has said that it is an honor for me to go to the Rajya Sabha

 Flowers contain so many emotions in themselves
 pyaar kaa izhaar ho yaa ho mohabbat kii baat, sabase pehle phool hi yaad aate hai
 Of course, there are other colors, but the deepest color associated with flowers is of love
 aapke jehan main bhi unako phool dene kaa ehsaas hilore maar rahaa he lekin, har phool se judi hoti he ek alag kahani
 The tongue of every flower is different
 or aap agar us jubaan ko samajhate hai, to yakeen jaaniye aapke dil kii ankahi baton ko lafjon kii baisakhi kii jarurat bhi nahin padegi
 She will understand all those things without saying
 jaaniye kaise or koun se phool aapaki daastaan-e-mohabbat ko mahakaa sakate hai
 Choosing a flower like this from the market will not help
 balki isse banati baat bighad bhi sakati he
 Flowers are different for every occasion
 or alag hoti he unki bhashaa
 The same flowers are not right for every occasion
 phulon kii is najaakat or jarurat ko samajhane ke liye aapako bahut zyada jaankaar hone kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Just a little thinking and understanding can make your job easier
 phool chunate samay maukey or vakt kii najaakat ko jaananaa-samajhnaa bahut jaruri he
 Remember otherwise, there are thorns with flowers - the beginning of a new friendship is not easy to express your feelings
 khaskar tab jab pyaar kii nai-nai shuruyaat hui ho
 There is a tide of emotions going on in the heart
 kabhi ek pal main aasmaan ko chune lagate hai jajbaat or duusare hi pal bheetar hi kahin dubak se jate hai
 If you want to give flowers to your partner on such an occasion, then the combination of pink, red and golden flowers will be right
 aapkaa guladasta jindadil or rangeen laganaa chahie
 Flowers-friendly friends also show the importance of someone to your eyes
 aap apni dost ke liye garden style phulon kaa chayan kar sakate hai
 This can be a great gift for your friend
 rumaniyat main duube hai aaparomance ke dauraan kisi mahila ko khush karne ke liye phulon se behatar koi or tohfa ho hi nahin saktaa
 There is a deep bond of love and flowers
 rishta apane har charan par phulon ke saath majboot hota jaataa he
 Here you have a lot of options
 aap unhen wo phool de sakate he jo wo hameshaa apni najaron ke saamne rakhana chaahati hon
 Or what is the opinion about the flowers that were smelling of your marriage and on seeing which they said in your ear, 'look how beautiful these flowers are' and all you could say was, 'no more than you

 It would be ironic to say that Yoga got the support of 177 countries, but what support cannot be gathered from 129 countries for Hindi? sarhadon ke paar japan, misr, arab va rus main hindi ko lekar kuch zyada hi sakriyata dikh rahi he, jo bahut hi sammaan kii baat he
 But why not in India? Perhaps the answer will be very difficult
 angreji bolne main hamen garv hota he, hindi bolne main hinata or jab tak is bhav ko ham puri tarah se nahin nikaal denge, hindi ko sammaan or sarvamaanya bhashaa ke rup main kaise dekh paaenge? Dr

 Munshi Premchand has a phd
 vah asagar vajahat ke hindi padhaane ke lahaze se prabhavit huin or hindi sikh gayi
 Hindi teacher in Germany Prof
 hince varnal vesler hindi ko samrudh bhashaa maanate hai, germany kii yuva peedi ko bhartiya vedon, granthon, chaoupaayiyon, dohon ityadi ke jariye iskaa vistrut parichay dete hai
 They believe that the pronunciation of every single word in Hindi is like yoga for Juban
 vaigyanik or software companiyon ke kai mukhiya bhi is baat ko behichak maanate hai ki digital bharat kaa sapana tabhi puraa ho paaegaa, jab hindi ko soochna or praudyogiki ke kshetra main anivaary kiya jayega
 a figure shows that the Central and State Governments have around 9,000 websites which first open in English
 yahi haal hindi main computer typing kaa he
 Other countries, including China, Russia, Japan, France, work in their own language on computers, but in India, many fonts of Hindi printing are prevalent
 inase pareshaani yah ki agar vahi font duusare computer main nahin hon to khulte nahin hai, vivashat: hindi mudran ke kai fonts computer par sahejane padate hai
 The Hindi practice of writing Roman words in Hindi newspapers has also become very popular
 isaki vajah shabdon kii nishchit seemaa yaa aasaan myne, kuch bhi ho sakate hai, par lagata nahin ki yah bhi hindi ke saath anyaay he
 The comments roman lipi ke 26 aksharon kii angreji, devanagari lipi ke 52 aksharon par bhi apana kabja jamaati dikhti he
 Perhaps the reason for this is to be divided and not serious about our own common language, as in other countries
 ham rajya, bhashaa or boli ko lekar hi dhadebaaji karte hai or angreji ko tarakkee kaa jariya maanate hai
 i wish if Hindi was the indispensable language of contact and government work in the whole of India, the value of the country would have increased even more
 samrudh hindi ke bhi achche din aaenge, hindi hi to bharat main vah bhashaa he, jo har jagah, samajhi or boli jaati he
 All that is needed is to accept it as a mutual contact language in the country
 hindi ke bhi 'achche din' aaenge, jarur aaenge, basharte bajaay aupchaarikta ke, sakaaratmak or eemaandaar pahal kii jaae

 hince varnal vesler hindi ko samrudh bhashaa maanate hai, germany kii yuva peedi ko bhartiya vedon, granthon, chaoupaayiyon, dohon ityadi ke jariye iskaa vistrut parichay dete hai
 They believe that the pronunciation of every single word in Hindi is like yoga for Juban
 vaigyanik or software companiyon ke kai mukhiya bhi is baat ko behichak maanate hai ki digital bharat kaa sapana tabhi puraa ho paaegaa, jab hindi ko soochna or praudyogiki ke kshetra main anivaary kiya jayega

 yahi haal hindi main computer typing kaa he
 Other countries, including China, Russia, Japan, France, work in their own language on computers, but in India, many fonts of Hindi printing are prevalent
 inase pareshaani yah ki agar vahi font duusare computer main nahin hon to khulte nahin hai, vivashat: hindi mudran ke kai fonts computer par sahejane padate hai
 The Hindi practice of writing Roman words in Hindi newspapers has also become very popular
 isaki vajah shabdon kii nishchit seemaa yaa aasaan myne, kuch bhi ho sakate hai, par lagata nahin ki yah bhi hindi ke saath anyaay he
 The comments roman lipi ke 26 aksharon kii angreji, devanagari lipi ke 52 aksharon par bhi apana kabja jamaati dikhti he
 Perhaps the reason for this is to be divided and not serious about our own common language, as in other countries
 ham rajya, bhashaa or boli ko lekar hi dhadebaaji karte hai or angreji ko tarakkee kaa jariya maanate hai
 i wish if Hindi was the indispensable language of contact and government work in the whole of India, the value of the country would have increased even more
 samrudh hindi ke bhi achche din aaenge, hindi hi to bharat main vah bhashaa he, jo har jagah, samajhi or boli jaati he
 All that is needed is to accept it as a mutual contact language in the country
 hindi ke bhi 'achche din' aaenge, jarur aaenge, basharte bajaay aupchaarikta ke, sakaaratmak or eemaandaar pahal kii jaae
 We take pride in speaking English, inferiority in speaking Hindi, and until we remove this feeling completely, how will we see Hindi as a language of honor and dignity? dow

 Right-arm fast bowler Anwar Ali came to bat at number 9 for Pakistan and he scored 46 off just 22 balls to turn the match in Pakistan's favor
 yah tii-20 international ke itihaas main number 9 ballebaaz kaa sabase zyaada ranon kaa record he
 Earlier, Pakistan's Sohail Tanvir scored 41 against Sri Lanka as the number 9 batsman
 pakistan ne ye muqaabala mahaj ek wicket ke antar se jeeta

 Not only this, this is the first time that Pakistan has won the match even after falling 5 wickets within 50 runs
 isse pehle saat maukey aise aae jahaan paanch wicket girane ke baad team vaapasi karne main naakaam rahi
 However, this victory of Pakistan is also special in the sense that with this victory, Pakistan won 7 matches in this series
 do test, teen vanade or do tii-20
 This is Pakistan's best performance in any bilateral series against Sri Lanka
 isse pehle 1994 main team ne srilanka ko 3 test or 4 vanade match main haraaya tha

 vaise pakistan kii ye jeet is myne main bhi khaas he ki is jeet ke saath hi pakistan ne is series main 7 match jeet liye
 Two Tests, three odis and two T20s

 china ne tibet main brahmaputra nadi par teen or baandhon ke nirmaan ko manjuuri di he or bharat ko is bare main suchit nahin kiya gaya he
 Indian officials said that the Chinese cabinet recently approved the document related to it
 isamen kaha gaya he ki brahmaputra nadi par dagu, jiya or jiexu main teen baandhon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 He said that the projects mentioned in the document are to be completed in China's 12th five-year Plan
 teenon baandhon ke sandarbh main nirmaan sambandhi koi vivaran nahin diya gaya he
 Officials said that India has not been informed about the move yet
 baandhon ke nirmaan kii yojana ke bare main puche jane par chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hong lee ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘seemaa paar nadiyon par vikaas ko lekar china ne hameshaa se jimmedaar rukh apanaaya he
 'he said,' any new project is studied under scientific planning and keeping in mind the interests of the countries in the lower and upper reaches of the river stream
 ’ china main brahmaputra nadi ko yaralang jangabo ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When asked if the construction of the dams has been approved or India and Bangladesh have been informed about this, Hong said that they need to get information about this
 china kii ore se yah faisla us vakt kiya gaya he jab bharat-china sambandhon main sudhaar dekhne ko mila he or donon deshon ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron ke bich kai daur kii baatcheet hui he
 In the talks between National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon and his Chinese counterpart Dai Bingguo, the reference to the waters of rivers across the border was discussed, but China does not appear to have informed of its plan to build the dams
 baandhon ke nirmaan ke mudde par bharat chintaa jataata rahaa he
 The issue also arose during the visit of the then Foreign Minister SM Krishna to China in March last year
 bihar main bijepi ke khilaaf khadey 'mahagathbandhan' ne siton ke bantwaare ke saath buudhvaar ko litmus paper test paas kar liya he
 Nitish Kumar announced that JDU and RJD 100-100 and Congress will contest assembly elections in 40 seats
 yani ek tarah se dekha jaae to chunavi gali ke sabase mushkil mode par gathbandhan ne sabase samajhadaari or santulan vaala faisla kiya he, lekin raajnneeti ke is dangal main asli dhobi pachhad ko paar paanaa abhi baaki he
 Because acid test is yet to be done
 teenon dalon ke bich siton kaa yah bantwaaraa is myne main mahatvapurn tha ki yaheen semhagathbandhanaki asli dhar kaa pataa chalata
 There is no fault in this, JDU-RJD has given the message that by taking the decision to contest elections on equal seats, no matter how much Nura wrestling is inside, the slogan of 'hum Sab Ek Hain' will be taken out
 is faisle ke saath congress ko bhi pradesh main apni chunavi jameen mil gai he, lekin yah sab itnaa bhi saral nahin he
 Because in politics, more hidden apprehensions matter than a direct signal
 nitish ke kitne apane ho paaenge 'lalu'siton ke bantwaare ke baad sabase bada sawaal janamat yani janata ke voton par aakar tik jaataa he
 Anshuman Tiwari, editor of India Today Hindi and a keen observer of Bihar elections, says, "the seats have been divided, but now the most important will be to see how many votes of Lalu Prasad go to Nitish's account
" sidhe shabdon main kahen to argedy ke voton kaa nitish ke khate main transfar hi mahagathbandhan kii jeet yaa haar kaa faisla karegaa
 Talking further about this count of votes, he says, "even though the base of Laloo Prasad and RJD may be slightly smaller than before, it is also true that they have a vote bank
" lalu-nitish ab tak ek duusare ke virdohi rahe hai
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see how much Lalu's vote bank accepts this mail
 loksabhaa chunaav ke samay ham isaki ek jhalak dekh chuke hai
 This is the most correct formula
 Anshuman says that there is no doubt that this is the right formula for seat sharing
 isse pehle sambhaavna jaahir kii ja rahi thi ki jediu 120-130 siton par apni daavedaari rakhegi, lekin isi bich donon pramukh dalon ke bich tanaav kii bhi khabaren ain
 Apparently the new formula gives an equal chance to both parties and also creates a balance
 vah kehete hai, 'isse kam yaa zyada kii sthiti main kisi na kisi kaa naaraaz hona tay tha or yah gathbandhan ke liye kahin se bhi shreshyakar sthiti nahin hoti he
 The pressure on the NDA also made the RJD-JDU appease each other with equal partnership in the sharing of seats, but the same arrow has also put pressure on the bjp-led NDA
 kyonkivirdohi khemene abhi tak aisa koi bantwaaraa nahin kiya he, jabaki vahaan jithan ram maanjhi se lekar ram vilaas paswan or khud bijepi adhik se adhik kii chaah rakhane kii manshaa jataa chuki he
 Although it is also decided that the final seal will be only on the bjp's decision, but there is no doubt that in view of the opposing 'grand Alliance', regional parties will also raise their head in that camp
 duusari ore, endie se pehle siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan kar mahagathbandhan ne jahaan ek ore janata ke saamne apni ranneeti saaf kar di he, vahiin bijepi nit virdohi kheme par manovaigyanik badhat banane kaa bhi kaam kiya he
 The electoral arena is not a big issue, considering that just as the jdu-rjd-congress has shown understanding and balance in seat sharing, the same maturity will be seen in the assembly segment
 mahagathbandhanse jude sutara bataate hai ki pehali praathamikta jiti hui siton ko di jaaegi
 After this, there will be a division of the possible seats for victory and then in the same order
 milegaa baraabar kaa maukaraajanneeti kii sabase badi niti shaayad yahi he ki yahaan har str par ek rajanati chal rahi hoti he

 kitna khubasurat shabd he srijan, matlab nirmaan
 But Bihar has given a new extension to the term
 srijan matlab vidhwans
 Demolition of public confidence
 sarkaar ke khajaane kaa vidhwans or samajaseva ke aacharan kaa vidhwans
 An NGO named Srigan has defrauded the Bihar government of over 700 crore
 yah ghotaalaa bihar kaa vyapam banataa ja rahaa he kyonki mukhya aaropee kii sandigdh paristhitiyon main maut gai
 Now Lalu Yadav's party is demanding Nitish Kumar's resignation
 agar aaropon kii samhita hi agar siyasat main kasuurvaar hone kaa paimaana he to bhartiya janata party ke sabase taaje saathi 700 karod kii lut main gale tak funs gaye hai, unke raaj main ek aise ghotaale kaa srijan hua he jisamen baqayada sarkari nigaraanee main khajaane se rakam ret kii tarah sarakati rahi
 Understand that creation is the Bihar version of Madhya Pradesh's Vyapam
 700 karod ke ghotaale main mukhya aaropee najir mahesh mandal kii haajat main hui maut ne sarkaar kii ghanti baja daali he
 Suspected death of the accused Mahesh Mandal, suspended from the welfare department, was arrested on 13 August
 iske baad 15 agast ko court ne unhen jail bhej diya
 After getting sick, Mahesh Mandal asked for an extension of treatment
 court ke aadesh par unhen mayaganj aspataal main bhartee kara diya gaya
 Mahesh Mandal died in suspicious circumstances on Sunday night
 bhagalpur kii is haveli se ghotaale ke srijan kii satta chalati thi, or satta bhi aisi-waisi nahin
 Big industrialists should be shy to see the turnover
 srijan mahila vikaas samiti naam ke enjio ke peeche sarkaar ke itane mantri, afasar or chaakar haath jode khadey rahete the ki agarbatti bechakar mahilaon ko aatmanirbhar hone ke hunar sikhaane vaala ek santhaan arabon kii ataari par khadaa ho gaya
 Creation is an amazing scam
 aarope he ki usne takreeban aadha darjan kalyankari yojanaon ke naam par bhagalpur jila prasashan ke alag-alag sarkari khaaton se karodon kii rakam nikaalte rahe or farjivada karke apane alag-alag khaaton main jamaa karte rahe
 In this game, government officials and bank employees fiercely supported the creation
 jediu-bijepi par bhi aropasrijan ghotaale main akele jediu hi nahin, bijepi bhi buree tarah fansi hui he
 It is alleged that Vipin Sharma, the state vice-president of BJP Kisan Morcha, was at the top among those who defrauded the government in the name of creation
 bijepi ne gardan fansati dekh aanan-fanan main vipin sharma ko party se nikaal diya
 But the gritty of the party did not diminish as Vipin Sharma is constantly on the run
 duusare jis dauraan yah ghotaalaa hua he us samay bihar main jediu-bijepi kii sarkaar thi, or aaj ke up mukhyamantri susheel netaa vitt mantri hua karte the
 Photos show that veteran BJP leaders like Shahnawaz Hussain, Giriraj Singh and Nishikant Dubey were among the honored visitors of the creation
 puri fehrist he srijan ke prabandhak amit kumaar or unki patni rajani priya ke saath prasann mudra main najar aane vaale bihar ke netaaon kii
 It is now known that these currencies were the printing of currencies for creation

 Despite the order of the CBI investigation, it is difficult for him to answer
 darasal is ghotaale main bihar sarkaar ke sushasan kii pole khol di he
 The people who run the creation used to have so much influence in the government that crores of checks emanated from the treasury used to reach the account of creation, and the frauds were so fine that the auditors did not even get a clue
 ab dekhie ki ghotaale kaa yah srijan pakadaa kaise gaya
 The scandalous creation of scams was revealed when one of three incidents of illegal money transfers came to light
 exiaar ke mutabik in teenon hi maamalon main chori ke nayab tareeke kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The business of Bihar would never have caught hold if the creation had deposited the correct checks in the correct account
 lekin hota ye tha ki sarkaar check kisi ke naam jari karti or rupaya pahunch jaataa srijan ke khate main
 For how it got caught, see creation fake number one
 srijan kaa farjivada number 127 sitambar 2014 ko pehali baar pakad main aayaa srijan kaa ghotalabhagalpur ke oriental bank of commers ne 12 karod 20 lakh kaa ek check jari kiya
 The check was to be deposited at the Indian Bank located on Patel Babu Road under Mukhyamantri Nagar Vikas Yojana
 lekin bank ne is check ko srijan enjio ke account main jamaa kiya
 Even more amazing is that the creation was registered as a cooperative society three days after the check was issued
 baat keval itani nahin he
 The NDA government had changed all the DNA of the rules and regulations for creation
 baabuon ne sari bahi bicha di thi, or trikaaldarshee mantriyon ke chakshu srijan ke santaap par jhukate chale gaye the
 Now see the fake creation number Dosrajan fake creation number 2 by Bhagalpur administration on 1, 3 and 6 September 2016
 5 karod kii keemat ke check jari kiye
 These checks were to be deposited in Indian Bank under Mukhyamantri Nagar Vikas Yojana
 us samay to teenon hi check sahi khate main jamaa kara die gaye
 But later the entire amount was fraudulently transferred to the account of the creation NGO
 iske liye check par baqayada dm ke farji hastakshar kiye gaye
 The real meaning of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was understood only by the moneylenders of creation
 itani badi-badi audit hui
 Accountants and Accountants saw the miracle of the expansion of Chashma Lagar creation
 lekin kya majaal ki ek bhi ghapala pakad len
 He turned up the statement of hundreds of pages of bank accounts, all failed in front of the experts of fake signatures
 srijan kaa farjivada number 310 november 2016 ko srijan ne swasthya yojana ke tahat sarkaar ko chuunaa lagaaya
 When the Chief Medical Officer of Bhagalpur 43
 52 lakh rupye ke teen check jari kiye
 These checks were to be deposited in the government account in the name of Bank of Baroda at Ghanta Ghar
 lekin ye check riject hokar 22 disambar 2016 ko waapas aa gaye
 But you will be surprised to know that the amount of that check had already reached the creation account
 srijan kaa srijan dekhakar brahma sristi kaa srijan bhul jaaen
 This is the investigation report of Saharsa DM
 8 maheene main pataa nahin kis kaam ke liye bihar sarkaar ne 186 karod 92 lakh 49 hajaar 924 rupye srijan mahila vikaas samiti ko die
 Later, when the secret was uncovered, the creation surreptitiously returned to the original government and the money was lost, and he closed the bank accounts in which the creation had deposited the amount in the first time as soon as the scam was opened

 Significantly, a rally of BJP MP was to be held in Munshi Pulia of Lucknow on Wednesday evening
 jila prashasan ne saansad ko raily kii ijaajat nahin di thi
 In such a situation, despite the ban, Yogi Adityanath reached the evening to address the public meeting
 is dauraan unhone sapa sarkaar par taanaashaahee kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki pradesh sarkaar sampradayik agenda ko badhaava de rahi he
 Adityanath said that 450 riots occurred in two and a half years in UP and this is the result of the failure of the SP government
 raily ko jila prashasan kii anumati nahin milane ke liye bhi yogi adityanath ne sapa sarkaar ko kosa
 He said that not getting permission is motivated by politics and all this has happened under pressure from the government

 science fiction filmon main time mashin to dekhi hi hogi jiske jariye log time travel kar lete hai
 They move from present to future or present to past
 science kii duniya main bhi ab tak ye kalpana kii tarah hi he
 But something similar has happened in a recent development or rather a similar discovery has been made
 rus ke vaigyanikon ne qwontem computer ke jariye time reversal kaa demonstrishan diya he
 Now keep in mind that this has not actually happened, that is, no one has traveled time
 vaigyanikon ne ek demonstrishan(pradarshan) kiya he or hairaani kii baat ye he ki yah physics ke niyam ke khilaaf he
 Scientists from Russia's Moscow University of Physics and Technology have developed a 'time machine' together with Switzerland and American researchers
 ise banane ke liye qwontem computer kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Scientists in Russia have claimed that a time machine has been designed that can reverse time, but only the fraction of seconds, that too as an experiment
 asal jindagi main nahin
 This has been done with the help of Quantum Computer
 ye kathith time mashin past yaa future main nahin le ja sakati he, lekin yah aage kii shodh ke liye bada brakethru jaisaa mana ja rahaa he
 This new research contradicts the second law of thermodynamics

 Even of the sun
 iske udhaaharan kai saare hai jo aap din bhar main dekhte hai
 Let me tell you that the first rule of this is that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred
 MIPT press officrus ke in vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya he ki unhone physics ke is lau kaa khandan kar diya he or time ko peeche kar diya he
 Dr
 gorde lejvik moscow institute of physics ant technolji ke head hai
 He has said, 'we have artificially created a state which is drawn in the opposite direction to the thermodynamics arrow of time'
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki ye series of papers thermodynemics ke duusare lau kaa bhi virodh karata he
 What is quantum computer? If you want to know quantum computer in clear words and less time, then understand this
 aam computer main jitani bhi jaankariyaan yaa aap data kah len, ye bits main store hoti hai
 You can understand this as 0 and 1
 qwontem computer main bits nahin, balki yahaan cubits (qwontem bits) hote hai or yahi 0,1 ke form main hote hai
 Information is represented by binary codes such as 0 or 1 for computing in common computers
 jabaki qwontem computing kisi information ko darshane ke liye Qubits yani 0,1 or 1 or 1 donon ke superpojishan state kaa istemaal karata he

 varun gandhi ne kaha ki kai pratibhashali yuva raajnneeti se jud nahin paa rahe hai or jagah nahin bana paa rahe hai kyonki unke paas prabhaavshaalee pita yaa godfadar nahin he
 Let me tell you that recently there were reports about Varun Gandhi that Varun Gandhi can join the Congress
 agra ke kai sthaneey congress kaaryakartaaon kii maane to varun ko bijepi main unke kad ke mutabik izzat nahin mili he
 He has been ignored in the party, he had the ability to become Chief Minister
 haalanki, varun congress main jaaenge aisa koi aadhikarik bayaan saamne nahin aayaa tha
 Speaking exclusively to India Today, Muslim leader Haji Jamiluddin says that Varun has been ignored in BJP, no one has the right to say anything other than PM Modi in BJP
 phir bhi varun ne lagaataar apni baat ko rakhaa he
 He said that many supporters of BJP had demanded to name Varun for UP CM, but this could not be done

 Many men feel that understanding women is nothing short of rocket science but in reality it is not
 mahilaon ko samajhnaa bahut aasaan hota he agar aap unhen samajhnaa chahen to
 What women want is not so complicated
 aaie jaanate hai mahilaayein kisi relationships main kya chaahati hai
 
 
 Respect- Whether women stand near you or far, they want respect from you
 iskaa yah matlab katai nahin he ki aap unki har baat maan len
 But at least ask for their opinion on every issue and listen to their opinion
 unhen yah ehsaas karaaen ki aap donon kii rishte main baraabar hai or saath main ek nai jindagi basaane ja rahe hai
 Life, family, friends and family are equally important for both of you
 sweekaaryata-aap jitna unhen mechap main pasand karte hai, utana hi bina mechap ke pasand karen
 As they are, accept everything from them as they are
 aap unke bare main jajmental naa hon
 a little romance - once a week ask them for a romantic dinner, taking time out for a date night
 mahilaayein chaahati hai ki aap unhen jis tarah se shuruyaat main pyaar or romance karte the, vaise hi ab bhi karte hai
 Hugging, watching a romantic movie together can at least do these small things
 unhen chahie atension-isamen koi shaq nahin he ki mahilaon ko relationships main aapkaa atension chahie
 Not only your attention but also your love
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap har vakt unke aage-peeche bhaage kyonki unhen bhi apana spes pasand hota he
 Make sure to take the time to call once a day and tell them that you miss them
 ghar ke kaam main haath bantaayen-mahilaon ko ye pasand nahin hota he ki ghar kii puri jimmedaari unke kandhon par daal di jaae
 If you help them in household chores, then nothing can make them feel better
 thodaa sa laad-bed par brakefast dena, sande morning main ek cap coffee, chota sa gift bas
 Even though women say that they do not like it all but they like it all
