pichley saal isi timahi main bank ko 1820 karod kaa laabh hua tha, is saal kii teesri timahi main 2416 karod kaa ghaataa hua
 The comments kya aapako pataa he ki bhartiya state bank ne reserve bank ko 31 march 2017 ko samaapt hue vittiya varsh kaa hisaab saunpa to usamen kitni gadabadi thi
 a year later, SBI told the Reserve Bank that the profit was 36 per cent higher and the NPA share was 21 per cent less
 kya itane bade bank main koi munafa 100 kii jagah 136 rupee yun hi bataa saktaa he
 Whether notes were being counted with fingers by applying water
 kya state bank of india main itani badi galati ke kaaran kisi bade adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui ? The question of Nirav Modi's handiwork should be answered less than here and there, the investigation of the handiwork should not be the case of NPA or sometimes it is a scam
 2 ji ghotaale kii itani baat hui, magar saare aaropee bari ho gaye
 Must be remembered mehul bhai yahaan baithe hai, mehul bhai davos main bhale nahin hai magar sarkari kaarykram main to hai
 Davos has a picture of Nirav Modi, about which Ravi Shankar Prasad says that CII took it
 vaise bhi jab pradhanmantri ko yah pataa he ki kitna bhi bada johari kyon na ho, sona kharidne par log apane gaanv ke sunar se check karaate hai to kya davos main photo khinchane ke pehle isi tarah kii check pradhanmantri ko nahin karwaani chahie thi
 It is also a fact that Nirav Modi was not exempted from taking photographs
 29 janvari or 5 farvari ko unke khilaaf exiaar hui
 Now it is a different matter that even after the FIR, they are busy opening their show rooms abroad for 15 days
 neerav kaa matlab hota he sannata
 11,300 crore scam happened with such silence, no one came to know
 congress ne kaha ki exiaar main kaha gaya he ki 9 farvari 2017 se 14 farvari 2017 ke bich aath farji letters of anderstanding jari kii gai
 Did Ravi Shankar Prasad answer this? ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki agar ve videsh main he to videsh main bhi karrwai hui he
 If the FIR is done here then what action is being done there
 kya exiaar ke baad sho room kaa udghaatan bhi karrwai he? unhen bataanaa chahie tha ki kya neerav modi ke khilaaf lukout notice jari hua he? punjab neshnal bank kaa share 11 fisadi gir chukaa he
 Its investors have lost Rs 3000 crore
 yah sab waapas to nahin aayega magar banking sector or hira vyapaar ke is karname ko aap tasveeron par mat jaaiye

 i want to mention two news related to the Punjab National Bank scam
 jo madhya pradesh ke akhbaar nai duniya main chhapi he
 The news of 19 January 2018 is that the CBI raided the coal merchant of Bhopal
 jin par punjab neshnal bank ke adhikariyon se milakar 80 karod kaa ghotaalaa kiya he
 The scandal took place between 2011 and 2016
 30 march 2016 kii khabar he ki punjab neshnal bank ne indore ke 27 vyapaariyon ko vilphul difalter ghoshit kiya he, jin par 217 karod kaa lone tha
 Do you know that State Bank of India had a loss of 2416 crores in the third quarter
 17 saal main pehali baar state bank of india ko itnaa adhik ghaataa hua he
 The bank had a profit of 1820 crores in the same quarter last year, a loss of 2416 crores in the third quarter of this year
 tippaniyan Do you know how much was wrong with the State Bank of India handing over the accounts of the financial year ended 31 March 2017 to the Reserve Bank

 Nirav means silence
 itani khamoshi se 11,300 karod kaa ghotaalaa ho gaya kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 The Congress stated that the FIR stated that between 9 February 2017 and 14 February 2017, eight fake letters of understanding were issued
 kya ravishankar prasad ne iskaa jawaab diya? Ravi Shankar Prasad said that if he is abroad, then action has also been taken abroad
 exiaar yahaan hui he to vahaan kya carrawai ho rahi he
 Is the opening of the show room after the FIR also action? They should have told if a lookout notice has been issued against Nirav Modi? Punjab National Bank shares have fallen by 11 per cent
 iske niveshkon ko 3000 karod kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 All this will not come back, but do not go over the pictures of this feat of banking sector and diamond trade
 kiski tasviir kiske saath he
 Who is whose tenant, these are all mild questions, the only question is how the scam of 11,300 crores was fraudulent? Keep an eye on the banking sector, whose condition is already bad

 com / 2r7dj15gfh —till date (@aajtak) January 4, 2018 Kumar Vishwas had made a big attack After the announcement of the terrorists, Vishwas made a big attack on Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone kaha tha ki mujhe sargical strike, tikat vitaran main gadabadi, jeenyu samet anya muddon par sach bolne ke liye mujhe dandit kiya gaya he
 i accept this punishment
 kumaar vishwaas ne kya kaha?pratikriya dete hue kumaar ne kaha ki sab apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 You are your fight, i am fighting mine
 main bahut shubhakamaayen detaa hum jinako ramlila maidan ke liye chunaa he
 i congratulate Arvind and the people who have decided the entire party
 navaneet bana kar bheja he desh ke sarvocch sadan main jahaan atal or indira kii aawaaj gunji he
 Kumar said that morally a poet, friend and agitator has won
 uttar pradesh ke sant kabeernagar se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saansad sharad treepathi ne apni hi party ke vidhayak rakesh baghel ko juute se peet diya
 The case of the BJP leaders being beaten up has given the opposition a sit-in issue
 uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne is puure maamle par tanj ksaa he
 He said that in Uttar Pradesh, there was a genuine exchange of shoes between the BJP MP and MLA claiming the world's most disciplined political party
 unhone aage kaha ki yah aagaamee chunaavon main apni haar se ashankit bhaajapa kii hataasha he
 The truth is that BJP is not getting candidates to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 akhilesh ne kaha ki janata janardan pahchaan lo yahi he bhaajapa kaa asli chaal charitra cheharaa
 In the election, you have an immediate opportunity to teach a lesson to such a leader and such a party
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko ek kaarykram ke dauraan bijepi saansad sharad treepathi or vidhayak rakesh baghel ke bich jamkar marpet hui thi
 During this time, BJP MP Tripathi had beaten up MLA Baghel with shoes
 is kaarykram main sant kabeernagar ke jiladhikari or yogi sarkaar main mantri ashutosh tandon bhi maujuud rahe
 Not only Samajwadi Party, Congress also did not delay to surround BJP on this issue
 congress pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi ne twit kiya ki bhaajapa ke saansad or vidhayak apni sabhyataa or samskruti kaa parichay dete hue
 At the same time, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti also took a dig at this incident
 mahabuuba mufti ne twit kiya ki meraa booth sabase majboot se meraa juuta sabase majboot
 Sharad Tripathi expresses regret after mp's Sharad Tripathi expressed regret
 unhone kaha ki main is ghatana par khed jataata hum or isko lekar main bahut bura mahasoos kar rahaa hum, jo bhi hua, wo mere saamaanya vyavhaar ke khilaaf tha
 If the State President of Bharatiya Janata Party has summoned me, i will present my side in the whole matter
 kya he puraa maamladansal puraa maamla shilapatt par naam ko lekar shuru hua
 The absence of a name in Shilapatta sparked MP Sharad Tripathi and clashed with Rakesh Baghel
 shuruyaat main donon main bahasabaaji hui
 But gradually the talk got abused and then the fighting started
 bijepi saansad sharad treepathi ne fouran juuta utaara or vidhayak rakesh baghel ke sir par barasaane lage
 MLA Rakesh Baghel said that the name of the MP is on the silapatta of the central government scheme and the name of the MLA is on the silapatta in the state government schemes
 isko lekar koi vivaad nahin hona chahie
 If there were any differences despite this, they could sit and talk to us
 baghel ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav aa rahe hai or ab kaaryakarta va janata saansad sharad treepathi ke saath nahin he, jisaki khij wo ham par nikaal rahe hai
 Baghel said that democracy has been wired in the district planning meeting
 srinagar main gupakaar road ke ek kone par sthit mahabuuba mufti said kaa sarkari awaas ''ferevy kabhi bhi itnaa chakachak nahin tha
 The front part gives a freshness of paint and varnish and its gardens are neatly trimmed
 baavjood iske yah chamak-damak kaaphi kuch banaavati jaan padati he us samay ke mukaable, jab marhoom mufti mohammad said ne do saal pehle bhartiya janata party ke saath milakar apni piples democratic party (pidipi) ko satta tak pahunchaa diya tha
 The same sentiment is evident in the reluctance that Mehbooba greets the visiting visitors at her home
 uthal-puthal bhare 13 maheene guzar chuke hai jab unhone 4 april, 2016 ko apane pita kii kursi sankoch ke saath grahan kiya tha or rajya kii iklauti mahila mukhyamantri aaj khud ko bahut buree tarah fansaa hua paa rahi hai
 The resentment of the people is on the upswing, which is not taking the name of pause
 duusari ore centre sarkaar kaa lagaataar aditol hota ravaiya he jisane algaavvaadiyon se kisi bhi tarah kii sambhavit baatcheet se inkaar kar diya he
 The party smells of rebellion and its ground base is rapidly shrinking in South Kashmir, which used to be the stronghold of PDP
 kashmir main nae daur ke ugravad ke nayak burhan vaani kii suraksha balon ke haathon pichley saal hui maut ke baad 8 july se sadakon par hinsa kaa jo daur shuru hua tha, usamen 90 se zyada log maare ja chuke hai or 15,000 se zyada log jakhmi ho chuke hai
 These include policemen, paramilitary forces and military personnel

 They include a schoolgirl named Insha Malik and many innocent children like her who came unintentionally in the path of pellets
 sardiyon main giri barf ke dauraan yah hinsa thodi thami thi, lekin iskaa ek or kabhi na khatm hone vaala khatarnaak daur phir se karavat le rahaa he
 Eight people died during the Lok Sabha by-election held in Srinagar on 9 April

 Due to Mehbooba's election to the assembly last June, another by-election was to be held in Anantnag's seat, which was first postponed to May 25, but was later repealed by the Election Commission
 kahani abhi khatm nahin hui he
 "the situation in Kashmir is such explosives in which the killing of another Burhan Wani is no longer needed to set fire," says a top security officer in Srigner
 " sena ke vaahan par patharbaji karne vaale tatwon ko pakadaaey ke liye pulavama ke rajkeey degree college main 15 april ko police ne jo karrwai kii, uske jawaab main samoochee ghati main swatahsfoort pradarshan bhadak gaye
 For the first time in Srinagar, small girls dressed in school clothes were seen involved in stone pelting (see box: stones in soft hands)
 asambhavit jagahon par bhi samasya paidaa ho gai, jaise puraane srinagar ke navakdal main schuli ladakiyon ke ek pradarshan ke dauraan pathar chale or ''aazaadee" tathaa ''burhan" ke naare lage, jisane surakshakarmiyon ko lagaataar satark bane rahane par majaboor kar diya he
 Journalist and commentator from Srinagar Shujaat Bukhari says, "this time the level of violence may be slightly lower than in 2016, but the feeling of segregation among the Kashmiri youth has been achieved
 " ghati main aaj tak bhadke har virodh kaa istemaal karne vaale hurriyat ke algaavvaadiyon ke bare main ve kehete hai ki ''ab unka asar nahin rahaa
 It seems that they do not understand anything
 "maamla sirf sadakon par ho rahe pradarshan kaa nahin he jisase mahabuuba ko nipatna he
 There has also been a spurt in terrorist attacks in Kashmir which is parallel to the growing discontent
 pichley 24 april ko hijbul mujahidin ke teen sashastr aatankiyon ne pidipi ke pulavama jila adhyaksh abdul gani daar ko raste main roak kar goli maar di
 Earlier in the week, National Conference leader Imtiaz Ahmed was targeted in Shopian

 Whenever elections are held in Anantnag, he says the party's stronghold in southern Kashmir will "exacerbate the pdp's problems" where the party's strong base has shrunk rapidly

 This was some time before the murder of Burhan Wani on 8 July
 dosier main likhaa tha, ''chunaavon ke dauraan jo yuva pidipi kii ore aakarshith hue the (naram algaavvaadi or bhaajapa virdohi line se) ve khud ko thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe hai
 These include a large number of youths from Jamaat and separatist groups who are raising fears that the BJP / RSS will destroy their identity as being Muslim and Kashmiri

 apane hataash kaaryakartaaon ke alaava mahabuuba ko puraane netaa mujffar beg jaise party ke varisht sahyogiyon se bhi dikkat ho rahi he
 Baig, who was the deputy chief minister in the first Mufti government, has said that in alliance with the BJP, the PDP has lost a large part of its political land
 ve yahaan tak suzav de rahe hai ki mahabuuba ko yah rishta todakar dobaaraa ''janata ke bich janaa chahie or uskaa bharosa jeetne kii koshish kerani chahie
 "mehbooba, the eldest of Mufti Saeed's four children and her successor, contested her first election in 1996 on a Congress ticket from Bijbehra at a time when people were not getting ready to be the face of the party after six years of presidential rule
 mufti ne 1999 main jab congress se rishta todgaye kaa faisla liya, us vakt ve apane pita ke peeche majbootee se khadi hokar phir se ek nai party banane kii aguai kar rahi thim
 While working together, the Mufti devised a Kashmir-centric strategy in Srinagar while Mehbooba was tirelessly engaged in the task of landing it at the grassroots level, making her the face of the PDP
 party ne 2002 main 16 siten jeetin or congress ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai jisamen mufti ko teen saal ke liye mukhyamantri banane kii vyavastha kii gai

 When Mehbooba took over as Chief Minister on April 4, 2016, she was full of challenges

 This was immediately reflected in almost everything he did, whether it was an administrative reshuffle in early 2016 or the reopening of schools after the death of Burhan Wani
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki mahabuuba salaahkaaron kii girakrat main hai
 Some of them are bureaucrats and leaders, such as Sartaj Madni who is his maternal uncle and also the general secretary of PDP

 Today, the PDP cadre is questioning the prudence of alliancing with BJP more than ever
 jaahir he, srinagar or jammu ke bich chaudee ho chuki dharmik or siyaasi khai ko paatane ke mufti said ke sapane kii bhrunahatya ho chuki he

 If this is the only instance left, the agenda of a mutually agreed between PDP and BJP - the promise of "sustainable and meaningful dialogue with all internal stakeholders" - has disappeared from the table of agreement

 He told the court that the Center had no plans to hold talks with "separatists" and those who were not loyal to India
 " agar dilli ke is paksh par koi andeh bachaa ho, to bhaajapa ke ram madhav kii pratikriya dekhni chahie jinhone pidipi ke saath rajkaaj ke agenda kaa masauda taiyaar kiya tha—unhone centre ke is paksh kii saraahna kii thi
 BJP general secretary Madhav, who came from the RSS, while reading a new Delhi mantra for Srinagar, had said, "treat the terrorists and their sponsors with maximum rigor
" haath main pathar lekar sadakon par utre digbhramit yuvaaon ko kushalta se bartaa janaa chahie taaki hinsa ko samaapt kiya ja sake, lekin dhyaan rahe ki isamen jaan na jane paae
 "interestingly, despite the changed stance on the issue of resumption of dialogue with Kashmiri separatists and the resulting stir within the PDP, Ram Madhav and Jammu and Kashmir in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna in BJP both say that someone in front of the alliance There is no danger
 mahabuuba haalanki sadhi hui jubaan main india today se kahati hai, ''gathbandhan utana hi majboot he jitna gathbandhan kaa agenda
 "during a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on April 24, Mehbooba stressed on re-starting the dialogue process with the separatists
 ve itani jaldi haar maanane vaali nahin hai
 While addressing the party leaders in Srinagar, the Chief Minister acknowledged that in order to move forward in any form of dialogue, it is necessary that the situation should at least start to appear as normal
 unhone kaha, ''kashmir aaj jis gark main he, usase use baahar nikaalane kaa iklauta tarika samvaad hi he
 "he suggested that the dialogue be taken forward from the point where it had missed the report of the arbitrators, the report of the five working groups and the agenda of the coalition
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki ''rashtriya hiton ke saath samjhauta na karte hue aisi das chizon ko talash panayya naammumkin nahin hona chahie jin par kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 Before Mehbooba convinces Delhi for a dialogue on Kashmir, before that she will have to face the challenge of dealing with the domestically growing insurgency, contact the youth in isolation and amidst all this, the government and development The work will also have to start anew
 pidipi kii yuva ikai ke pramukh vahidurrahman paara haalanki is masale par alahada raay rakhte hai
 They believe that this dialogue should be multilateral and the Prime Minister himself should lead it in an "emotional" manner

 "60 per cent of the people living in the Valley are young people with about 2 million students whose age is below 38 years

 Parra believes that the pdp's failure to take things forward on the coalition's agenda is now being taken over by the separatists and militants on the vacant political land
 ve khaskar dakshini kashmir kaa udhaaharan dete hai—anantnag, pulavama, kulgaam or shopiyaan—jahaan pidipi ke saamne neshnal conference yaa congress ke rup main koi vipaksh maujuud nahin hota tha
 Apart from this, restoring stagnant development in the valley is also an important task

 Meanwhile, works like repairing roads, their construction, flyovers constructed to relieve Srinagar from jams and clearing the flow of Jhelum to avoid future floods have been put on hold

 Dialogue is a destination in itself
 yah logon tak sandesh pahunchaata he ki koi to unhen sun rahaa he
 "like Mehbooba, he points to the success of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had talked to both Hurriyat separatists and Pakistan since 2002
 ve kehete hai, ''tab ugravad halkaa-phulka jari rahaa lekin sadaken shant thim
 "para says the initiatives that have taken place in recent times, such as the efforts of the MP group led by CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury last summer or the efforts of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, have raised a lot of hope from them
 ve kehete hai, ''aise prayaas kaaphi asar daalate hai
 "whatever the bjp's leadership in Delhi and Jammu may think, but in Kashmir, the spokesperson of the party, Khalid Jahangir, himself is a supporter of dialogue
 ve haalanki algaavvaadiyon ke saath kisi vishisht samjhaute ke haq main nahin hai jo ''baar-baar nirarthak hi sabit hua he

 a senior BJP minister in Mehbooba's cabinet also says something similar: "it has come to Delhi to stop appeasement of all kinds and to make the people of Kashmir really realize that living in a conflict zone How can it be? "suraksha adhikariyon kii maane to kashmir par centre kii niti main parivartan ke peeche yah khulaasa bhi kaam kar rahaa he ki pakistan vahaan ''logon ke asantosh ko hawa dekar" halaat ko ubalte rahane dena chahta he
 An official says that there are less than 250 militants in Jammu and Kashmir of which 214 are identified in police records; Of these, 60 per cent are local youth, of which almost all are from the Hizbul Mujahideen and are active in southern Kashmir
 is baat ke pukhta saboot hai ki ye ugravadi 3,000 se zyada aise ojidblyoo (overground kaaryakartaaon) ke saath milakar kaam kar rahe hai jo algaav main pade naujavaanon ko jutaney main madad karte hai
 "and most of it is being managed from across the Line of Control," says a state police officer
 " police adhikariyon ko haal hi main pataa laga he ki kareeb 60 whatsap samoohon kaa prabandhan pakistan or uske kabje vaale kashmir se kiya ja rahaa he jinamein se prayek main ghati ke 250 yuva sadsy hai
 Except for the membership of various groups, there are more than 5,000 highly active youth members from southern Kashmir alone who are always in touch with each other
 ek police afasar kehete hai, ''yah jabardast tareeke se sangathit he
 "apart from these challenges, another problem facing Mehbooba is that she is compared to her marhoam father who is not known to her
 bhale hi 1999 se akele dam par pidipi ko khadaa karne kaa shrey unhen jaataa ho, lekin adhiktar log mahabuuba ko rajkaaj or centre se talmail ke maamle main kaccha hi maanate hai
 "mufti Saeed was a far more astute politician who had to listen and understand and apply the words of the people quietly," says a top police officer who was under the protection of the chief minister from 2002 to 2006 in the pdp's early tenure
 " ve kehete hai ki mahabuuba ''maamuli chizon main ulajh jaati hai, pakshpaat karti hai or apane sahyogiyon par bharosa karne main sashankit rahati hai
 "her greatest strength is her ability to connect with the people, but after becoming Chief Minister, the manner in which she has gone to the Chief Minister's office, it is quite possible that this skill will also go out of her hands

 "the Chief Minister does not forget to narrate an anecdote when in 1990, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi expressed anger at his father that he did not come to meet any Kashmiri in Srigarnar
 ve raat bhar shahar main rahe or unhen bharat virdohi naare hi sunai dete rahe
 Returning to Delhi the next morning, Rajiv Gandhi said to the mufti, "mufti, can Kashmir get back to us again?" Mehbooba is confident that Kashmir is firmly with India
 srinagar sthit apane awaas par 30 april ko mukhyamantri ne india today se kaha, ''meraa kahana ye he ki kashmir hamaare paas he or jameen bhi hamaare paas he, lekin hamen us mode par nahin pahunch janaa chahie jahaan hamen khud se poochna padeh ''kya ham kashmir ko haar rahe hai?"isiilie march 2015 main gathit gathbandhan ke 16 panne ke saajha agenda main kiye vaadon se bhaajapa bhale ab mukar gai ho lekin mahabuuba party ke sahyogiyon se lagaataar ek baat kah rahi hai ki ve koshish nahin chodengi

 siem yogi ne somvaar ko pratapgarh ke madhupur gaanv main dalit parivaar dayaram saroj ke ghar khaanaa khaaya, jisaki khub charchaa hui
 But during this meal, the BSP has caught the issue of Yogi's minister Swati Singh making bread and started airing it
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne ise naatak qaraar dete hue kaha ki yogi adityanath ne bhale hi dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaaya ho lekin roti to swati singh ke haath kii bani hi khai
 Swati Singh made roti for Yogi, tell us that Swati Singh belongs to Thakur caste and had made bread for Yogi Adityanath sitting in the kitchen of Dalit family Dayaram Saroj
 swati singh pratapgarh kii prabharee mantri hai
 In such a situation, the photo of his bread making became public, which BSP has been trying to give different colors

 'eat and cook food for Dalits' BJP spokesperson Dr Chandramohan says that BSP has been duped by bjp's dalits reaching the doorposts and stoves
 unka kahana he ki dalit samaaj hamaare liye sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa sabase ahm hissaa he
 Therefore their thinking will make them happy
 Our leaders will not only eat food at the homes of Dalits, but our leaders will also cook food in their kitchens
 swati singh aise ai thi charchaa mengauratlab he ki swati singh yogi sarkaar main mantri hai
 In 2016, Swati Singh came into the limelight when she opened a front against the disputed statement made by then BSP leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui on the sarcastic words of her husband Dayashankar Singh

 dilachasp he ki chunaav main nitish kumaar ke saamne piem narendra modi ko cheharaa banane par bijepi main hi vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Sushil Modi has denied the statement of Union Minister Anant Kumar in this regard
 sumo ne kaha ki modi banaam nitish kaa prachaar bhraamak he
 Significantly, on Tuesday morning, Bihar election in-charge Anant Kumar said that the BJP will contest elections in Bihar also on the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yani bihar main nitish banaam narendra modi kii siyaasi ladaai hogi
 But as the day progressed, former Deputy Chief Minister of the state and BJP leader Sushil Modi denied Kumar's statement
 susheel modi ne kaha ki bihar main mukhyamantri bijepi se hi hoga, lekin siem koun hoga yaa chunaav main kiskaa cheharaa saamne hoga is par koi aadhikarik muhar nahin lagi he
 This whole incident is also special in the sense that Sushil Modi was also with him at the time when Anant Kumar was firing the arrow with 'nitish vs Modi', but Sumo did not comment on this
 aise main sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki aakhir din dhalate-dhalate aisa kya hua ki 'chote modi' ne apane tarkash kii sud lee
 On the other hand, the Opposition has started making it an issue, sensing the compulsion of the BJP in this whole matter
 jediu-argedy gathbandhan pehle hi nitish kumaar ke naam par muhar laga chukaa he
 On the lines of Kejriwal, Nitish is already roasting his face first
 july main hoga faisalabijepi netaa susheel modi ne anant kumaar ke bayaan kaa khandan karne ke saath hi yah bhi kaha ki party vidhanparishad chunaav ke baad july main siem ummidavaar yaa is ore koi faisla karegi
 However, be it bjp's helplessness or an attempt to curb discord between the party and the alliance, it is clear that the BJP has no strong face for the post of CM
 aise main anant kumaar ke bayaan or us par susheel modi ke khandan ne bijepi kii andruni siyasat ko bhi garm kar diya he
 Lalu Prasad had said that Nirvanshiyah is also a coincidence that this whole issue in BJP has come at a time when RJD chief Lalu Prasad had declared BJP as a descent during the workers' conference on Monday itself
 lalu ne saaf taur par kaha tha ki bijepi vanshaheen ho chuki he or uske paas koi cheharaa ab nahin bachaa he jo nitish ke saamne khadaa ho sake
 However, on the issue of dynasty, Sushil Modi surrounded Lalu Prasad and said that for Lalu, the rightful dynasty and dynasty is the power
 susheel modi ke mutabik jeethanram maanjhi ke prayog ke baad lalu prasad ke liye vanshavaad or pukhta ho chukaa he, jabaki bijepi hameshaa apni aage kii peedi taiyaar kar jaati he
 7 members arrested for fabricating fake documents, fake paper also recovered Was
 kamaal kii baat yah he ki yah puraa khel chandauli ke eartio daftar ke baahar sthit dukaanon main chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 Police arrested 7 people in this case
 inke paas se police ko computer, laptop, printer sahit parivahan vibhaag kii nakli muhar, barcode, nakli registration paper kaa formet or alag-alag beemaa companiyon kaa blank insurance paper bhi baraamad hua he
 According to the police, the game of making fake documents was going on for many days, but after the new traffic rules came into force, this racket was speeded up
 darasal, chandauli police ko soochna mili thi ki eartio daftar ke paas sthit photo state kii dukaanon main parivahan vibhaag sambandhit nakli dastavej taiyaar kiye jate hai
 After this, the police of the Crime Branch and the Alinagar police station of Chandauli district raided these shops under the leadership of Chandauli Sadar Deputy SP Tripurari Pandey
 chhapemari ke dauraan police ne 7 logon ko giraftaar kar liya or inke paas se nakli kagajaat banane kii saamagree bhi baraamad kii
 The accused arrested, currently police have registered a case against these 7 people under relevant sections and sent them to jail
 police ab is baat kaa bhi pataa laga rahi he ki kya nakli kagajaat kaa gorakhdhandha chalaane waalon ke taar parivahan vibhaag se bhi jude hue the
 Significantly, from last 1 September, revised traffic rules were implemented in many states of the country including Uttar Pradesh, under which the amount of fine was increased many times
 nayaa niyam lagu hote hi yatayaat niyamon ko todane waalon ke khilaaf jabardast checking abhiyaan bhi chalaaya jane laga
 With this, crowds of people started gathering at the ARTO office to get driving license and car papers
 halaat yahaan tak aa gaye kii driving license ke liye logon ko kai-kai maheene intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, the silver of those who made fake papers began to be cut
 haalanki, chandauli main yah khel to pehle se hi chalaa aa rahaa tha, lekin nae trephic niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad yah gorakhdhandha or teji ke saath shuru ho gaya tha
 In this context, Additional SP Premchand of Chandauli said that for the past many days, complaints were being received that fake documents related to transportation were being made in shops located near the ARTO office
 soochna ke aadhaar par team gathit kii gai or chhapemari kii gai
 7 people were arrested in action
 iske saath hi nakli kagajaat banane ke dher saare upkaran or saamagree bhi baraamad hui hai
 The police have filed a case against all these under relevant sections and sent them to jail

 By the way, the source of the Alaknanda is at a great distance from here, but Shiva's sliver must have been scattered far and wide

 But my mind does not agree
 naam isliye bada nahin he ki vah naam he
 He grows up because he has received social acceptance
 rup vyakti satyak he, naam samaaj satyak
 The name refers to the post which is stamped by the society, modern educated people call it as 'social culture'
 meraa man naam ke liye vyakul he, samaaj dwaara sweekrut, itihaas dwaara pramanit, samshti maanav kii chitt ganga main snaat
 What is the name of this girikoot-bihari? The mind is flying far and wide - in the country and in time

 Again and again, the mind is unable to believe that Yaksha is just an excuse, Kalidas had once reached Ramgiri by 'shapenastansangamagamahima', he had prayed to Megh by offering this kutj flower on his own hands
 shivalik kii is anatyuhachch parvat-shrinkhalaa kii bhanti ramagiri par bhi us samay or koi phool nahin mila hoga
 Kutj had supported his battered mind - this is a big flower
 dhanya ho kutj, tum 'gadhe ke saathi' ho
 Raising my head towards the north, i see that the far black mountain range is covered and the children of a few white clouds are playing around it
 main bhi in pushpon kaa ardhya unhen chadha don? par kaahe vaaste? lekin bura bhi kya he?kutj ke ye sundar phool bahut bure to nahin hai
 The one who has worked for Kalidas should get more respect
 mili kam he
 But respect is a matter of luck rahim ko main bade aadar ke saath samaran karata hoon
 Was a generous man, found sleeping lekin duniya he ki matlab se matlab he, ras chus leti he, chhilka or guthli phenk detii he
 It is heard that Rahim was also thrown after sucking the juice
 ek badshaah ne aadar ke saath bulaayaa, duusare ne phenk diya
 It does happen
 isse rahim kaa mol ghat nahin aata
 His fun has not gone anywhere
 achche bhale kadradaan the
 But even big people sometimes have such an attack that they make mistakes
 man kharaab rahaa hoga, logon kii berukhi or bekadradaani se murjhaa gaye honge- aisi hi manahosthiti main unhone bichaare kutj ko bhi ek chapat laga di
 He was annoyed, said: When is this Rahim, where can the shadow be serious, Bagan bitch between looks, Sainhud Kutj Karir
 goyaa kutj adana-sa 'birch' ho
 What is the 'big' thing, flowers and nothing? There should be some respect for the flower, not just for the shade
 magar kabhi-kabhi kaviyon kaa bhi 'mood' kharaab ho jaaya karata he
 They also fall prey to misrepresentation
 phir baagon se girikut-bihari kutj kaa kya tuk he?kutj arthath jo kut se paidaa hua ho
 'kut' is also called pitcher, it is also called home
 kut arthath ghade se utpann hone ke kaaran pratapi agastya muni bhi 'kutj' kahe jate hai
 What must have arisen from the pitcher
 koi or baat hogi
 In Sanskrit, 'kutharika' and 'kutakarika' are called maids
 kyon kehete hai? 'kutiyaa' yaa 'kutir' shabd bhi kadachit isi shabd se sambhddha hai
 what
 is shabd kaa arth ghar par hi he? ghar main kaam-kaaj karanevaali daasi kutkarika or kutaharika kahi hi ja sakati hai
 a slightly miscast maid is also called 'kutni'
 sanskrit main uski galatiyon ko thodaa adhik mukhar banane ke liye use 'kuttani' kah diya gaya he
 Was Agastya Muni also the son of a maid like Naradji? There is no point in being born in a pitcher, neither in relation to the sage kutj, nor the flower kutj
 phool gamale main hote avashya hai, par kutj to jangal kaa sailaani he
 What does it have to do with the pot or pot? The word is certainly thought-provoking
 kahan se aayaa? mujhe to isi main andeh he ki yah aryabhashaon kaa shabd he bhi yaa nahin
 If a philosopher found any Sanskrit word prevalent in more than one form, he immediately doubted his nobility
 sanskrit main 'kutj' rup bhi miltaa he or 'kutch' bhi
 You can also get 'kutz' to meet
 to yah shabd kis jati kaa he? arya jati kaa to nahin jaan padataa
 Silvan Tevi has said that most of the words of flowers, trees and cultivated horticulture in Sanskrit language belong to the Agneya language family
 yah bhi vahiin kaa to nahin he? ek jamaana tha jab austrailia or asia ke mahadweep mili hue the, phir koi bhayankar prakritik visphot hua or ye donon alag ho gaye
 Nineteenth-century philological pundits were surprised to see that the language of the castes in the remote jungles of Australia was associated with the language of some of the castes in Asia
 bharat kii anek jatiyaan vah bhashaa bolti hai jinamein santhal, munda aadi bhi shaamil hai
 Initially, this language was named astro-asiatic
 dakshin purv yaa agnikon kii bhashaa hone ke kaaran ise aagney-parivaar bhi kaha jane laga he
 Now we have started calling it the language of the Kol family, keeping in mind the special category of the Indian public and remembering the old literature
 panditon ne bataaya hai ki sanskrit bhashaa ke anek shabd, jo ab bhartiya samskruti ke avichchhedya ang ban gaye hai, isi shrenee kii bhashaa ke hai
 The words Kamal, Kudmal, Kambu, Kambal, Tambool etc
 are said to be similar
 ped-paudhon, kheti ke upkarnon or aujaaron ke naam bhi aise hi hai
 What surprises even if 'kutz'? The Sanskrit language never considered contagion in the collection of words
 na jane kis-kis nasl ke kitne shabd usamen aakar apane ban gaye hai
 Pundits are surprised by investigating him
 sanskrit sarvagrasi bhashaa he
 The waving plant of Kutj, which stands before me, is declaring its unbeatable biographical strength in both name and form
 isiilie yah itnaa aakarshak he
 The name has been living for thousands of years
 kitne naam aae or gaye
 The world forgot them, they forgot the world
 magar kutj he ki sanskrit kii nirantar sphiman shabd raashi main jo jamake baitha so baitha hi he
 And what is the matter of form
 balihaari he is maadak shobhaa kii
 It is green and full in the blazing heat like the wretched expanse of Yamraj all around, more than the mind of Durjan, the rage in the stone of the stone is made of succulents by drawing barbous juice from an unknown water source and more than the mind of a fool In Giri Kantar, there is so much fun that there is jealousy
 kitni kathin jeevani-shakti he
 Prana itself is the pulpit of life, biographical strength is the inspiration for biographical power
 dur parvataraaj himalay kii himachhadit chotiyaan he, vahiin kahin bhagwaan mahadev samadhi lagaakar baithe honge, neeche sapaat patharilii jameen kaa maidan he, kahin-kahin parvatanandini saritaayen aage badhane kaa rasta khoj rahi hongi - bich main yah chattaanon kii oobad-khabad jatabhumi he - sukhi, neeras, kathor
 My well-known friend Kutaj is sitting here with his seat
 ek baar apane jhabareele murdha ko hilaakar samadhinishth mahadev ko pushpasastabak kaa uphaar chadha dete hai or ek baar neeche kii ore apni pataal bhedi jadon ko dabaakar girinandini saritaaon ko sanket se bataa dete hai ki ras kaa strot kahan he
 Wanna live By piercing the hard stone, rip the chest of the Hades, collect your enjoyment, suck the atmosphere, rub the thunderstorm, recover your attainable, kiss the heavens, swing in the recess, and draw joy
 kutj kaa yahi upadesh he :bhithwa pashanpitharan chhitvaar prabhanjaneen vyathampithwa patalpaniyan kutjashchumbarte nabh:
 Durant is the life force
 kathin upadesh he
 Living is also an art
 lekin kala hi nahin, tapasya he
 Live the life in two lives, the mind in two devices of life
 thik he
 but why ? Is it a big deal to live? The whole world is living for its own meaning
 yajyavlky bahut bade brahmavaadi rishi the
 He tried to convince his wife in a bizarre sense that everything was for the sake of selfishness
 putr ke liye putr priy nahin hota, patni ke liye patni priya nahin hoti - sab apane matlab ke liye priy hote hai - 'atmanastu kaamay sarv priyan bhavati
 'isn't this logic bizarre? Wherever there is love in the world, all for meaning
 suna he, pashchim ke hobbs or helvacious jaise vichaarkon ne bhi aisi hi baat kahi he
 It is surprising to hear
 duniya main tyaag nahin he, prem nahin he, pararth nahin he, parmarth nahin he - he keval prachand swaarth
 Inner life - a strong desire to live - if it is a big thing, then all these big dialects, on whose strength teams are formed, Shatru Mardhan is acted, the slogan of desolation, literature and art Glory is sung, lies
 iske dwaara koi-na-koi apana bada swaarth siddh karata he
 But thinking internally is thinking wrongly
 swaarth se bhi badi koi-na-koi baat avashya he, jijeevishaa se bhi prachand koi-na-koi shakti avashyak he
 What is it? What Yajnavalkya said in a blunt manner was not final
 ve 'atman - ' kaa arth kuch or bada karnaa chaahate the
 The 'soul' of a person is not limited to the individual, it is comprehensive
 apane main sab or sabamein aap - is prakaar kii ek samshti buddhi jab tak nahin aati tab tak purna sukh kaa anand bhi nahin miltaa
 The 'selfishness' clause is true until it squeezes itself like a Dalit beast for 'all', it promotes attachment, generates craving and makes a man miserable is
 carpanya dosha se jiskaa swabhaav upahat ho gaya he, uski drushti mlaan ho jaati he
 He cannot see clearly
 vah swaarth bhi nahin samaj paata, parmarth to dur kii baat he
 Is the kutz only living? He does not go to beg at the door of another, if one comes near, he is half dead in fear, does not preach policy and religion, does not lick the shoes of the officers for his advancement, planets to humiliate others Does not cheer, does not wear sapphires for self-promotion, does not wear rings of rings, does not wear teeth, does not look armpit
 jeeta he or shaan se jeeta he - koi vaaste, kis uddeshy se? koi nahin jaanata
 But there is something big
 swaarth ke daayre se baahar kii baat he
 Like Bhishma Pitamah, he is saying in the language of Avadhoot: 'whether happiness or sorrow, dear or unpleasant, one who is found with grace, completely undefeated from the heart, take solace
 haar mat maano
 'sukha va if or sorrow dear or if vapriyaam
 praptany praptamupasit hridayenaparajitah
 (shantiparva, 25 / 26) Hridayenaparajitha
 kitna vishaal vah hriday hoga jo sukh se, dukh se, priy se, apriy se vichlit na hota hoga
 It is thrilling to see Kutj
 kahan se mili he yah akutobhaya vritti, aparajit swabhaav, avichal jivan-drushti
 The one who thinks that he is doing the favor of others is ignorant, the one who thinks that others are rejecting him is also unintelligent
 koun kiskaa upkaar karata he, koun kiskaa apkaar kar rahaa he? manushya ji rahaa he, keval ji rahaa he, apni ichha se nahin, itihaas vidhaataa kii yojana ke anusaar
 Let someone get pleasure from him, it is a very good thing, could not get it, no problem, but he should not be proud
 sukh pahunchaane kaa abhimaan yadi galat he, to dukh pahunchaane kaa abhimaan to nitant galat he
 Grief and happiness are alternatives to the mind
 sukhi vah he jiskaa man vash main he, dukhi vah he jiskaa man paravash he
 To be dependent means to cheer, brush teeth, sycophancy, yes
 jiskaa man apane vash main nahin he vahi duusare ke man kaa chandavartan karata he, apane ko chhipaane ke liye mithyaa aadambar rachataa he, dusron ko phasaane ke liye jaal bichhaata he
 Kutj is free from all these misconceptions
 vah vashi he
 She is recluse
 raja janak kii tarah sansar main rahakar, sampurna bhogon ko bhogakar bhi unase mukt he
 Like Janaka, he declares: "I do not always move my mind for the sake of selfishness, so i can conquer the mind and control it" mano se nirjitan tasmaat vashe tishthati sarvada
 Kutaj rides his mind, does not let the mind ride on his mind
 manasvee mitra, tum dhanye ho

 kundalika desh kii iklauti nadi he jahaan white water rafting kaa anand saal bhar liya ja saktaa he
 About 122 km from Mumbai and Pune is the Kundalika River in Kolad in Raigad district
 water rafting kaa shuruaati point rawalje gaanv ke najadik he
 Water rafting has to be completed 12 km in two hours
 yahaan pratidin 120 paryatak water rafting karte hai
 Water rafting is the safest in the Kundalika River and even a teenager of 14 years can do water rafting fearlessly
 kolad main bhira dam he jahaan hydroelectric plant he
 Water is released daily from this dam every morning
 isi pani main water rafting karaayaa jaataa he
 This water runs into Roha Creek in the Arabian Sea
 water rafting kaa anubhav lene ke liye paryatakon ko sterling holidays ke nechar trails resort main ek din thaharnaa padegaa
 The reason for this is that water rafting starts at half past eight in the morning
 water rafting ke starting point or aakhri manzil par pahunchane ke baad kapade badalane or thodaa aaraam karne ke liye nechar trails resort hi he
 However, there is a fee of Rs 650 to 1200 per person for water rafting
 lekin resort ke package main anya suvidhaon ke saath sasta bhi padataa he
 In the monsoon, water rafting is its own fun
 monsoon se pehle or baad main bhi kaaphi romaanchak rahata he
 Water rafting was started here in 2006 and so far about 40 thousand tourists have done water rafting
 water rafting ke liye videshi paryatak bhi aate hai
 River rafting in Kundalika River takes place under the supervision of Mercury Himalayan Exploration (MHE)
 emechai kii ore se desh ke anya ilaakon main bhi river rafting karai jaati he
 Trained instructors are also brought here from Rishikesh
 12 se zyada rabad tair hai jis par baithkar paryatak water rafting karte hai
 Life jackets, helmets and paddles are given to each member by MHE and they are also told how to do water rafting
 instractor dharamvir rishikesh ke rahane vaale hai jo chah maheene tak kundalika main rahete hai or baad main ve rishikesh or ladakh jaakar instractor kaa kaam karte hai
 According to Dharamveer, rapids have different names in Kundalika River
 ve naam ke saath khatarnaak repids ke bare main bhi bataate hai
 River rafting begins with Good Morning Buddha
 iske baad dhire-dhire repids tej or romaanchak hota jaataa he
 It has important wave rapids such as Bush on Band Rapid and Morning Haddock Rapid
 morning hedek rapid ke baad khatarnaak rapid aata he jon kairi rapid or johny vaakar rapid
 John Carrey has more roux, causing current and higher waves in the water
 dharamvir kaa kahana he ki is water rafting main ab tak kisi tarah kii durghatana nahin ghati he
 There is also no dangerous animal inside the water
 isliye jab rafting ke aakhri kinare par pahunchate hai to usase ek kilometre pehle hi rafting karne waalon ko life jacket pahane hi pani main utaar diya jaataa he
 People enjoy swimming
 agar kisi ko tairnaa nahin aata he tab bhi unako pani kaa majaa lene ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 No one is drowned by the jacket they are wearing
 logon ko bataaya jaataa he ki rafting ke dauraan agar koi boat se pani main girtaa he to use kis tarah se pakadakar boat par laana he
 Water rafting in Kundalika River must be enjoyed once

 Baba Nagarjuna wrote these lines for Haripal Tyagi
 haripal tyaagi kaa kal nidhan ho gaya
 He was a story writer, poet, painter, writer, satirist, art critic and above all a better man

 haripal tyaagi 85 saal ke ho chale the, par kala se unka naata puri tarah chuta nahin tha
 The special thing is that his birthday was passed recently
 haripal tyaagi kaa janm 20 april, 1934 ko janapad bijanour ke gram mahuwa main hua tha
 The father's name was Sher Singh Tyagi and mother's name was Dayawati Devi

 There were three pictures in the room - Swami Dayanand, Gramophone and Tala
 unhen dekh haripal tyaagi ke man main lalak uthati thi ki kahin se rang mil jaye to vah bhi apni tasveeron main rang bhar den
 This ardor persisted in him all his life
 vah apni kunchi or kalam se vahi gaanv, vahi sapane ukerte rahe
 Haripal Tyagi had little interest in schooling

 In childhood, Munshiram's gimmick party came to the village
 nautanki kii kamalabai ne haripal ke balman ko andolit kiya
 At the behest of Kamalabai, when the cast of the drama 'sarwar Neer' became ill, Haripal played the role of 'neer'

 But someone gave this information to Haripal Tyagi's father in the morning - there was chaos in the house

 However, in the metropolitan life of Delhi, Haripal Tyagi often mentioned these incidents

 This increased his interest in painting
 unhone ek akhbaar main cartoonist ke rup main kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 His paintings were exhibited at the Lalit Kala Academy in 2013, which was inaugurated by Ashok Vajpayee
 tab mahesh darpan se baatcheet main unhone bataaya tha, "meri pehali pradarshnee shridharani gailaree nai dilli main hui thi

 An oil painting 'vasantasena' was published and acclaimed in a magazine in 1961
 mujhe apane anubhavon or koshishon par hi zyada nirbhar rahanaa padaa

 But i did the work by being dedicated
 mujhe garv he ki main apni mehnat ke bal par gadha gaya kalakaar hum
 "in the same interview, he clarified his point further, he said," i think that in any field of art, internal energy and the eye of the beholder are of the greatest importance

 Dreams and reality, ie, dreams and reality, are closely related
 ye ek-duusare se ghule-mili hai
 Sometimes a piece of our reality emerges in our dreams
 thik isi tarah sapane kaa koi ansh bhi reality kaa bhram de detaa he
 Creative arts are not reality in themselves
 ve sapana bhi hai or reality bhi
 But when she poses in front of some truth, she also turns herself into truth
 tab ve hamaari chetana ko samrudh kar shakti detii hai
 The enlightenment of every human being creates a different creation parallel to the outer world

 "indeed Haripal Tyagi was a great painter as a painter
 unako kaam karte dekhnaa ek romaanchak or chaunkaane vaala anubhav hota tha
 They might have become drugged before starting painting

 Children's literature books were printed as 'morning Singer', 'chamkila Moti', 'conversion of Spatakis' and 'amarphal', while the autobiography was titled 'adhuri Ibrat'
 vyangy par bhi unki gahari pakad thi
 That is why he was a bitter critic of satirical writing
 raajapaal and sans se chhapi apni pustak 'mahapurush' main unhone likhaa tha, ‘‘sahitya ke vyangyatmak rup ko lambey samay tak halke dhang se liya jaataa rahaa he
 More responsible for this are the satirists who used to write it as lighthearted
 bhashaa kii baat chhod bhi den, apane aas-paas ke jivan or vibhinn samaajon ke antarvirodhon main dilchaspee lene or dilon main jhaank kar dekhne vaale, kitne thode-bahut ulat-pher ke saath likhit pustakon se uthaai gai bhashaa or unamem se hi nikaali gai ‘rachanaatmakataa’ se kuch der ke liye rob bhale hi jhaad len, lekin basi curry ke chhaunk-baghaar koi kitne din chalaaegaa ? acha yahi hoga, apni roti khud kama kar uske swaad-gandh se dusron ko bhi parichit banaaya jaae

 input language input- bhashaa The old saying is Khoisiani cat pillar
 lekin baar-baar apni haar se khisiaya hua bagdadi apane aatankiyon kii jindagi hi noch letaa he
 If the terrorists of Baghdadi do not stand before the army of syria-iraq and they leave the field and run away, it punishes them very severely
 aisi sajaa ki unhen aag main jalaata he or phir jinda maar daalata he
 This is what happened in Mosul, where Baghdadi killed 20 terrorists
 inamen chaar bhartiya shaamil hai
 Baghdadi considers the way of its terror, killing them
 jo usko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar dete hai, unako bhi maar daalata he
 He also kills the terrorists who fight for him, but wants to return in the middle
 uske aatank ke kaarobaar main apnaapan to un aatankiyon ke liye bhi nahin he, jo us shaitan ke liye apni jindagi jhonk dete hai
 He killed twenty terrorists going to great lengths
 bagdadi dwaara maare gaye bees aatankiyon main chaar bharatiyon ke shaamil hone kaa andeshaa he
 Intelligence agencies have received reports that these terrorists were fighting for Baghdadi in Mosul
 syria or iraq main bagdadi ke thikaanon par rus, america or europea deshon ne tabadatod hamale kar rakhe hai
 In many places, his oil wells and his weapons have been consumed
 vah is kadar tabah ho chukaa he ki usne apane aatankiyon kii tankhwaah tak kam kar di he
 Seeing death, he wanted to build his stronghold in Libya after the terrorists' tremor and Iraq, but the US has already uprooted his land there
 isiilie apni paap kii duniya ko bachaane ke liye usne aatankiyon ko bheja ki wo pashchimi deshon kii mixilon kaa muqabla karen
 But seeing the death from the sky, the terrorists were shaken
 wo waapas iesas ke camp main aae
 But here he got an even worse death
 bagdadi ne paar kii haivaaniyat kii hadengrih mantralay kii hi report he ki bagdadi ke liye ladane gaye 23 hindustani naujavaanon main se 6 kii maut ho chuki he
 The boy who became a terrorist of Baghdadi was killed unabated
 ye report or bagdadi kii barbarta kii taaja kahani ye ishaara karti he ki usne kaise haivaaniyat kii sari hadein paar kar di he
 The worst situation is there for those Indian youth who go to join the terrorist brigade of Baghdadi
 hindustani aatankiyon ko doum darje kaa maan jaataa he
 Baghdadi is tricked in the name of religion
 ISIS has killed about 19 thousand people in Iraq in the last two years
 syria main lagbhag 3500 begunaahon ko maar daalaa he
 Youth from all over the world are joining him, trapped in the propaganda of ISIS
 jis dharm ke naam par barglaakar unhen ladane bulaayaa jaataa he
 Forgetting the same religion, they are discriminated against on the basis of race and creed
 khaas taur se bharat, bangladesh or pakistan ke yuvaaon ke saath
 Discrimination against the youth of the Indian subcontinent The information shared by the Intelligence Share to the Indian Home Ministry suggests that youth from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan get low-level work
 senior padon par arab orsyria ke aatankirahate hai
 They get better weapons, safer work and better pay
 bhartiya upmahadweep or africa mul ke aatankiyon se bhed bakriyon sa bartaav hota he
 They are put forward in the battlefield
 taaki arab aatankiyon kii maut kam ho jaae
 Suicides made to youth by deception These young people are used fraudulently to commit suicide attacks
 barood bhari gaadi dekar unhen kaha jaataa he ki wo khaas jagah par jaakar apane mobile se khaas number dial karen
 Then they will be told the target
 vahaan wo fidaayin ko gaadi dekar waapas laut sakate hai
 But as the trainees call the terrorists
 gaadi main rakhaa barood datonet hokar blast ho jaataa he
 Youngsters are intimidated by citing jinn
 do ladakiyon ko banaaya poster garbhprail 2014 main austria kii samaara cacinowich or sabina selimovich iesas main bhartee hui thim
 Baghdadi gave him Poster Girlbana
 sabina goli lagane se mar gai
 But after Samara tried to escape from Raqqa, fed up with atrocities, the terrorists beat him up so much that he died
 itnaa hi nahin in donon kii tasveeron ko bagdadi ne sex slave ke taur par prachaarit kiya
 So that youth can be added by luring Ayyashi
 syria main lard rahe hai 17 hindustaniajtak ke haath ye exclusive jaankaree lagi he ki bagdadi kaa aatanki bane 17 hindustani aaj bhi syria main hai
 Intelligence agencies feel that among the twenty terrorists who have been killed, four were Hindustani
 haalanki hindustan se bhatakane vaale naujavaanon kii sankhya kam he, lekin bagdadi unke saath jaisaa bartaav karata he, wo sabaki ankhen khol dene ke liye kaaphi he
 The story of his cruelty is screaming

 He was speaking to reporters in Bhubaneswar on the last day of the three-day All India Executive meeting of the Sangh
 samaan aachaar samhita par unhone kaha ki ye maang kaaphi puraani he
 It should have been decided at the time of constitution
 yah sabhi ke hit main he or kisi bhi desh main uske nagarikon ke liye ek samaan kanoon hona hi chahie
 Bhairav lal Das's book 'gandhi's Creation in Champaran' gives graphical details of Gandhi's Champaran Lan movement
 champaran andolan ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa padhaa gaya
 But there are many such things recorded in this book which no one has told before
 kitaab main aap kareeb sau saal pehle us mahatvapurn andolan kii ball tu ball reporting pard sakate hai jahaan aapako pataa chalegaa ki nilhe angrej champaran main kisaanon se jabaran nil kii kheti hi nahin karavaate the, balki darjanon aise tex lete the jise sunakar ruh kaanp jaati he
 We do not know whether the rulers had taken tax from the public in India when the mother and father died, but this book tells that the British used to pay 'baphi-potahi' tax in such a situation
 motargadi yaa hathi kharidne par alag tex
 There is a long list of such loot
 agar kabhi bihar kaa aadhunik itihaas likhaa gaya to yah pustak ek mahatvapurn sandarbh granth he
 In this book we find such characters which are not usually in the memory of people - like Ramnavami Prasad, Dharanidhar Prasad, Purnendu Narayan Sinha, Ramadayalu Sinha, Hasan Imam, Syed Ali Imam, Ramraksh Brahmachari Maharaj Rameshwar Singh etc
 aise logon kii ek lambii suchi he jinhonen gandhi ke saath kandhaa se kandhaa milakar champaran aandolan ko mukaam tak pahunchaaya tha
 The book also has a rough idea of the role Kayasthas and Muslims (especially lawyers) played in the politics of erstwhile Bihar and also in the movement of a separate Bihar state
 gandhi champaran main sirf ek raajnneetik kaaryakarta nahin the, balki ve samaaj sudhaarak bhi the, yaa yon kahen ki unke vyaktitv kaa ek bada hissaa samaaj sudhaarak kaa hi he
 Gandhi, like South Africans, had experienced in Champaran that unless comprehensive reform work is done in society, people will not be able to gain confidence
 unhone champaran main shiksha, swasthya, swatchta, samuhik bhojan or chhooaachhut ke khilaaf abhiyaan ityadi vyapak str par shuru kiya
 But it is the misfortune of the society of Bihar that after they left from there, either they stopped school and social reform campaigns or got caught up in irregularities
 kehete hai ki gandhi ke kaaryakramon se prerana lekar bihar ke anya jilon masalan darbhanga, bhagalpur or anya jagahon par bhi kai neshnal skool khule lekin baad main yaa to ve band ho gaye yaa bhoomafia ke changul main funs gaye
 The number of such schools and their status can be a subject of separate research and book-writing
 is kitaab main tatkaaleen bihar kii saamanti manovruti- jisaki chhap abhi tak barkaraar he, badlaav ke prati anicchhuktaa, rajasav, yatayaat vyavastha, nil kii kheti kaa bharat main itihaas or uskaa vaishvik sandarbh ityadi kaa vishad varnan he
 The biggest thing is that the way Gandhi's personality is seen as a bridge or compromise between the two systems is amazing
 gandhi the bhi aise hi
 His work in South Africa was similar to this
 unhone jis satya or ahimsa ke astr kaa avishkaar kiya tha wo dusron ke prati ghrinaa par aadhaarit na hokar apane haq or prem kii baat karata tha
 Ramachandra Guha, who has written Gandhi before India (hindi translation- Before Gandhi India: Early life and political journey), also appears in this role
 haalanki ek vyakhyaakaar ne dakshin africa main gandhi kii kam se kam ‘solah bhoomikaaon’ kaa zikr kiya he lekin gaur se dekhen to gandhi mukhyat: sabhyataaon ke bich main pul hi the jahaan satya or ahimsa yaa satyagrah ko unhone pillar kii tarah istemaal kiya tha
 This book not only mentions his colleagues from Bihar in the Champaran movement but also volunteers from the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Orissa etc
 yahaan gandhi ke vyaktitv main adbhut kootneetijna kii bhi jhalak milti he ki kaise unhone kin-kin swayamsevakon se kis-kis tarah kaa kaam liya
 Gandhi is seen as a complete controller of the movement where he did not allow the then Congress or other leaders of the country to interfere there more than a limit! It is said that a large composition is the background of many future works
 gandhi kaa jivan apane aapmen ek mahakavy he jisamen champaran mahatvapurn adhyyon main se ek he
 But the chapter Champaran becomes epic when many sub-stories come out of it and many possibilities
 lekhak ne ‘pratap’ ke sampadak ganesh shankar vidyathi, bhagat singh or chandrashekhar kaa champaran se sambandh, gandhi dwaara sthapit vidyalayon kii durdasha, rajkumaar shukla dwaara pehle pahal unke liye ‘mahatma’ shabd kaa prayog or nil kii kothi dwaara chodi gai jameen kii bandarbaant jaise kai aise kone chhod die hai jis par alag se lekhan ho saktaa he
 Significantly, the author was inspired to write this book when he was working on the Kathy script and translating the diary written in Raj Kumar Shukla's Kathy script into Devanagari
 kitaab kaa mulya zyada rakhaa gaya he jo ise aam janata se dur karti he
 It should have a paperback version and also it is not available on online marketing sites
 is kitaab main betia raaj par vistaar se likhaa janaa chahie tha jisaki kami khatkati he
 The number of photographs in the book is also relatively small and their size is kept small
 lekin sabase badi baat yah he ki is kitaab main itane zyada sandarbh hai ki sandarbhon ko puraa pard paanaa bhi shramsadhy kaam he
 Bhairav lal Das, who has taken out a rare medicine in the form of Champaran from the bible of hundreds of books and documents, is praised

 samaajawaadee party or cycle par apane-apane daawey lekar jab party ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kheme chunaav ayog pahunche to ye tay mana ja rahaa tha ki sapa kaa naam or chunaav chinh fries ho jayega or chunaav ayog donon khemon ko alag naam or chinh ke saath chunaav ladane ke liye kahegaa
 This is the reason that on Monday evening, when the Commission was declared Akhilesh Yadav as the real actor of the Samajwadi Party, everyone was surprised but if we look at the decision of the Commission with more than 40 pages, it is clear that Akhilesh is riding a bicycle
 It is not found like this only
 ye hai wo 5 vajahen jinke chalate ayog ke akhaade main mulaayam ko unke hi bete ne patkhni de di
 The Mulayamulayam camp, which could not prove the session illegal, contended that according to the constitution of the Samajwadi Party, only its president could call the party's session, hence the session convened by General Secretary Ram Gopal is illegal
 aise main us adhiveshan main liye gaye faisle bhi avaidh hai lekin akhilesh kheme kii daleel thi ki mulaayam ne khud hi kabhi sapa ke samvidhan kaa paalan nahin kiya
 The way Ram Gopal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav were removed and then withdrawn was not in accordance with the Constitution
 samvidhan ke tahat niyamit antaraal par party kaa adhiveshan bulaane kii jo vyavastha thi uskaa bhi paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 On behalf of Akhilesh pro-akhilesh camp, 4716 out of 5731, Ram Gopal Yadav supported 205 claims out of 228 mlas, 56 out of 68 mlas, 15 out of 24 Lok sabha-rajya Sabha mps, 28 out of 46 members of the National Executive and No affidavit or any such affidavit was submitted by Mulayam Singh Yadav's camp, who submitted affidavits of 4400 members involved in the national convention
 kul milakar party ke 5731 main se 4716 samarthak akhilesh kheme ke saath the
 The team of 11 lawyers came to the Commission to present arguments on behalf of the Mulayamulayam camp which could not prove the session illegal, while the Akhilesh camp fielded the country's renowned lawyer Kapil Sibal to plead their case
 mulaayam khemaa sirf ramgopal ke bulaae adhiveshan ko hi khaarij karata rahaa lekin uske paas is sawaal kaa koi jawaab nahin tha ki jab party ke takreeban saare janpratinidhi or padaadhikari akhilesh ko adhyaksh maan chuke hai to mulaayam ko party kii kaman or cycle kaa nishaan kyon mili?party main baghawat se karte rahe inkaarmulaayam singh yadav kii ore se tark diya gaya ki party main koi baghawat yaa tut nahin hui he kyonki ramgopal yadav ke adhiveshan main bhi mulaayam singh yadav ko maardarshak banaaya gaya tha
 He was not expelled from the party, so saying here that there is a rebellion against Yadav in the party will not be right
 khud akhilesh yadav ne bhi mulaayam kii jagah rashtriya adhyaksh banane kaa koi namakan patr nahin bharaa
 But the manner in which the Ram Gopal camp presented affidavits of 90 per cent members in support of Akhilesh weakened the argument of the Mulayam camp
 saansadon-vidhayakon kaa nahin mila saathchunaav ayog main mulaayam khemaa jahaan ye maanane ko hi taiyaar nahin tha ki party main koi matbhed yaa baghawat hai, vahiin ramgopal yadav kii ore se kapil sibbal kaa saaf-saaf tark tha ki party do kheme main bant chuki he or loktantr main jis kheme ke paas sabase adhik nirvaachit pratinidhi hai, vahi chunaav chinh or party par haq rakhata he
 Even after the decision of the Commission, Sibal gave his response saying that the Election Commission has given this decision after investigation from many perspectives
 akhilesh kii ore se jahaan sabhi dastavej rakhe gaye vahiin mulaayam kheme ne chunaav ayog ke nirdeshon ko andekha kiya jisase saaf he ki unke paas apane tark ke samarthan main koi dastavej nahin the
 a Delhi court yesterday stayed the release of the movie Mohalla Assi
 khabaron main kaha gaya ki yah film 3 july ko relies honi thi
 Interestingly, neither the director Chandraprakash Dwivedi nor the producer Vinay Tiwari nor the lead actor Sunny Deol are aware of this release date

 This novel, published in installments, had become a topic of discussion in literary and cultural circles
 usee par aadhaarit is film kii abhi tak dabing bhi puri nahin hui he lekin pichley maheene iske li hue ek promo ke aadhaar par jagah-jagah iske khilaaf log adaalaton main pahunchane lage
 complaint? That it is presenting a false image of Banaras, Hindu culture and deities
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi dikhaaenge yah filmatiwari to hairaani jataate hue kehete hai, 'logbanaraski samskruti ko bigaadpee aa rahe the, uske prati aagaah karne ke liye hamane yah film banaai or ab log bina dekhe hi iske khilaaf maahaul bana rahe hai
 We have not even visited the board of Humsancers relies ke liye taiyaar hone par ek baar ham pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi ise dikhaane kii koshish karenge
 We are confident that once they have seen the film, they will surely make it tax free, given its theme
 ' nirdeshak dvivedi bhi kehete hai ki film chunki chaar saal pehle bani thi
 It will also be edited anew and there is still some dubbing left
 isse pehle hifilmpar roak lag janaa durbhagyapurna he
 It is heard that after the leaked promo, its main actor Sunny Deol has also started taking interest in it from the atmosphere surrounding the film

 grahamantri banane ke baad amit shah puure form main hai, kashmir main artical 370 or 35 e ko khatm karne kii sugabugahat to he hi, sutron se khabar he ki centre sarkaar jammu kashmir main parisemen bhi kara sakati he
 The day Amit Shah took over as Home Minister, he had a meeting with Satyapal Malik, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, and it was said that the first challenge to the newly appointed Home Minister is Mission Kashmir
 ab sutron se khabar he ki grahamantri amit shah jammu kashmir main parisemen par vichaar kar rahe hai
 a commission may be formed for delimitation
 jammu kashmir main bijepi ke netaa chaahate hai ki jaldi hi parisemen kiya janaa chahie
 Jammu and Kashmir BJP President Kavindra Gupta says that he has written to the Governor that the state should be delimited
 isse rajya ke teenon kshetron jammu, kashmir or ladakh kshetra ke saath nyaay hoga
 However, now the politics of this delimitation has to be understood properly
 jammu kashmir vidhansabha main kul 111 siten hai
 But in Jammu and Kashmir, elections are held in only 87 seats
 jammu kashmir ke samvidhan ke section 47 ke mutabik 24 siten khaali rakhi jaati hai
 The 24 seats vacated were left vacant for Pak Occupied Kashmir
 jaankaron kii maane to is ganit se bijepi ko sidhaa phayda hoga
 How BJP will benefit Jammu region has 37 assembly seats
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi yahaan 25 siten jiti thi
 The BJP dominates the Jammu region
 agar parisemen hua to khaali padi 24 siten jammu kshetra main judengi
 BJP feels that it will benefit from delimitation
 ab parisemen kii siyasat kaa aglaa adhyay samajhie
 Jammu and Kashmir was delimited in 1995
 rajya ke samvidhan ke mutabik jammu kashmir main har 10 saal ke baad parisemen hona tha
 But it was banned by the then Farooq Abdullah government in 2002 till 2026, and now BJP wants delimitation again
 Distressed to hear about gois plan to redraw assembly constituencies in J&K
 Forced delimitation is an obvious attempt to inflict another emotional partition of the state on communal lines
 Instead of allowing old wounds to heal, goi is inflicting pain on Kashmiris— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)june 4, 2019lekin kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti parisemen ko sampradayik aadhaar par rajya ko baantne ke taur par dekh rahi hai
 He tweeted, 'troubled to hear about the Indian government's plan to remodel assembly constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir
 bevajaah kaa parisemen rajya ke ek or bhaavnaatmak vibhaajan ko sampradayik aadhaar par bhadakaane kaa ek spasht prayaas he
 The Government of India is increasing the pain of Kashmiris instead of allowing them to heal old wounds
 'mahabuuba mufti par bijepi kii ore se palatwaar kiya gaya
 BJP MP from East Delhi Gautam Gambhir tweeted that i am in favor of solving the Kashmir problem through dialogue, but it is ridiculous to call Amit Shah's procedure rigorous
 itihaas ne hamaara dhairya or sanyam dekha he, lekin ab hamaare logon kii suraksha agar balpurvak hoti he to hone do
 However, it remains to be seen whether the BJP, which promises to remove sections 370 and 35A from Kashmir in its affidavit, will take some revolutionary steps in Kashmir

 For the last two days, there has been a debate on NRC in the country and it is being said that 40 lakh Indians have been declared illegal, whereas the reality is that after the primary investigation, those who are not Indians are named NRC (NRC)
 Are removed from
 2
 The 40 lakh figure is not a final figure, a full investigation will be done under the patronage of the Supreme Court and only then a decision will be taken

 The Assam Accord, which took place during the time of the Rajiv Gandhi-led government, is the soul of the NRC explaining that every illegal infiltrator will be selected and excluded from the electoral rolls of the country

 Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling is waiting impatiently in his official residence
 vah vyakti peedblyoo vibhaag se ek chitthee lekar aa rahaa he
 Two days earlier, in his 32-day tour of the state, he met a 32-year-old woman who is the mother of three children in the Bermiok region of West Sikkim
 usne haal hi main pati khoyaa he or uske paas aamadani kaa koi jariya nahin
 He extended his hand to the Chief Minister for help
 chamling jab bhi aisi yatra par nikalate hai to unke laav-lashkar main mantri or vibhinn vibhaagon ke sachiv bhi hote hai
 Chamlingne PWD department secretary has to pay Rs 9,000 for that woman in his department
 prati maah kii naukari kaa intjaam kaa aadesh diya
 This was not a promise like the common leaders had to be forgotten
 chamling khud niyukti patr dekhakar tasalli karenge
 They monitor even the small promises of the government to this extent
 janata ke saath sidhe judaav kii badaulat ve desh ke sabase lambey samay tak shashan karne vaale mukhyamantri bane hai
 On 28 April, he broke Jyoti Basu's record of being Chief Minister of West Bengal for 23 years and 137 days
 chamling pehali baar 12 disambar, 1994 ko mukhyamantri bane the or us samay se lekar ab tak ve lagaataar chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 This is his fifth consecutive term

 According to Komal Singh, Head of the Department of Economics at Sikkim University, "they are the best choice for the post of Chief Minister because there is no life in the opposition
" '' haalanki keval kamjor vipaksh hi chamling kii lagaataar safalataa kii vajah nahin he
 Despite allegations of corruption and nepotism against the government of SKM, the main opposition party formed by the SDF rebels, Chamling has not allowed a dent in its vote bank
 kam se kam gramin ilaakon main to chamling kaa vot share bilkul hi nahin khiskaa he
 Three-quarters of the state's voters come from rural areas
 sadsath varshiya ye mukhyamantri jo apane guru or purv mukhyamantri nar bahadur bhandari se baghawat kar or unhen bedakhal karke satta main aae the, shaayad baagiyon se nibatane kii kala main siddhhast hai
 In 1992, Chamling, a member of Bhandari's party SSP, sparked a revolt against Chief Minister Bhandari in a dramatic manner
 chamling vidhansabha main mombatti jalaakar loktantr khojane lage the
 Describing Bhandari as a dictator, he formed his own party called SDF
 janata kaa bharosa jeeta or 1994 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main satta bhi hasil kar lee
 From that time on, he is very cautious about not harming his image of the champion of democracy
 unhone jis din party banaai thi usee din yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki unke parivaar kaa koi sadsy raajnneeti main kadam nahin rakhega
 They are still up to their mark
 1994 se lekar 2009 main apni mrityu tak bhandari hi chamling ke mukhya rajnatik pratidwandvi rahe
 The SDF registered an unprecedented and historic victory in the 2004 elections when it won 31 out of 32 seats in the state and again in 2009 it won all 32 seats
 2014 main unhen chunauti mili apane hi purv sahyogi or eskeem ke netaa prem singh tamang se jo pies gole ke naam se prasiddh hai
 PS tried to repeat the same history Chamling had with Bhandari
 teen baar ke vidhayak or 1994 se chamling sarkaar ke mantri gole ko party main chamling ke baad doosraa sabase taqatvar netaa mana jaataa tha
 The SKM won 10 urban seats but the sdf's slogan of "development, Peace and Security" proved to be the skm's slogan of change
 baad main chamling ne eskeem ke 10 main saat vidhayakon ko apni partimen mila liya or is tarah vidhansabha main unki takat 29 vidhayakon kii ho gai
 Chamling's true difficulties also came to an end when Gole was convicted in an old case of corruption while serving as a minister and has been in prison ever since

 Prabhas has addressed his three million followers in all his 35 Instagram posts so far
 ve do bahubali filmon kii baari safalataa ke baad hi is photo or video-shering plateform par aae, jisane unki chhavi ko ek telegu superstar se samgr bharat vaali banaaya
 By the way, social media, unlike other actors, is simply attached to his work for Prabhas
 ve thodaa sharmaate hue kehete hai, ''main pehle se behatar hum
 "they are sitting in the banquet hall of a five-star hotel, where five of their bodyguards keep their eyes out
" ve apni naveenatam film saaho ke prachaar main jute hai
 Releasing on 30 August, the action thriller Saho is shot in three languages - Hindi, Tamil and Telugu
 350 karod rupye ke anumaanit bajet se bani is film kii shooting do saal tak chali
 This is three years less than Prabhas's previous film
 filmon ke do nirmaataaon main se ek, shobu yaralgadda prabhas kii patibaddhta kii saraahna karte hue kehete hai ki iske bina bahubali film ban hi nahin sakati thi
 He says, "when he was 32 years old and at the top of his career, he came with us and gave such a long time
" isse apane kaam ke prati unka junun or dusron se aage jaakar kuch alag karne kii unki bhukh kaa parichay miltaa he
 Prabhas has not made any theater debut since his debut in 2002, between the release of Baahubali: The Beginning in 2015 and Baahubali: The Conclusion in 2017
 yaralgadda kehete hai, ''pehali film ke baad, bahubali kaa charitra sabhi ke dimag main chap gaya tha or ve nahin chaahate the ki darshakon kii dharna badale
 While Baahubali was an ambitious project, directed by noted director S
K
 es
 While Rajamouli did, Saho rests entirely on Prabhas' shoulders
 beshak is sitare ke kandhe bahut damdaar or vyapak ho sakate hai, lekin jis paimaane par film relies ho rahi he—anumaanit 4,500 screen par ek saath relies kii khabar he, use dekhte hue lagata he ki iske nirmaataa yuvi criation or tii-siries ne abhinayta kii lokapriyata par bahut bada daanv khelaa he
 Prabhas says, "yes, there is pressure on me because everybody knows me as Bahubali
 '' unhone kaha ki chunauti, badi pariyojna ko khojane kii thi jo vishesh rup se bahubali ke duusare bhaag ke hindi main dab hone ke baad hindibhashi kshetron main bani unki vyapak lokapriyata ko bhunaane main madad kare
 Baahubali 2 remains the highest-grossing film of all time in Hindi with a gross of Rs 510 crores
 sankhya se utsahit nirmaataaon ne saaho ko hindi main bhi banane kaa faisla kiya
 This is the first time Prabhas has dubbed the Hindi lines himself
 ve kehete hai, ''hindi ke kaaran pradarshan badal gaya
 This was done to reach a larger audience
 '' rajnikant or camel hasan jaise tamil film sitaron ne bollywood main apni damdaar pakad or prashansak banaae lekin telegu film industry ne vastav main aisi safalataa nahin chakhi thi
 Only Chiranjeevi could do this to some extent
 lekin itane kam samay main prabhas kii pakad kahin adhik ban gai he
 In the Telugu film industry, Prabhas is known for films such as Chhatrapati (2005) and Mirchi (2013), which made him popular as an action star, and with the romantic comedy Mr
 Perfect (2011) he proved that he was only an action star No, rather they have much more diversified capabilities than this
 telugana or andhra pradesh main prabhas ko lekar logon main vahi deewangi he jaisi rajnikant ko lekar tamilnadu main dekhi jaati he
 This can be gauged from the fact that recently when the trailer of Saho was run in a theater in Hyderabad, people started dancing in front of the big screen
 prabhas kii sah-kalakaar shraddha kapur kahati hai, ''ve iske hakdaar hai
 He is a unique person and a very honest and passionate actor
 '' yaralgadda bhi prabhas ke bare main aise hi vichaar rakhte hai
 Manufacturer u
 suryanarayan raju ke putr, prabhas kii filmon main kaam karne kii koi khaas ichha nahin thi
 This desire was not born until he saw his uncle Krishnam Raju playing the character of an atheist in the film Bhakta Kanappa, who gradually became the ultimate devotee of Lord Shiva
 prabhas yaad karte hai, ''isane mere andar kuch paidaa kar diya
 Why don't i also become an actor? Then i thought 'no, no, it is not for me
 ''' aakhirkaar vah paariwarik vyavsaay main hi shaamil hue or 2002 main ishwar film se filmi parade par dastak di
 The decision to act has proved right for them, but they have decided that they will not enter politics
 prabhas ke chachaa ne 1998 main andhra pradesh ke kakinanda seat se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa or jeeta
 Prabhas traveled and campaigned with him in the election campaign
 ve kehete hai ki unhen is kaam main jaraa bhi majaa nahin aayaa: ''film industry main 17 saal ho gaye hai or main abhi bhi sahaj nahin ho sakaa hum
 Politics is a completely different game
 ''saaho bade bajet kii samakaleen film ho sakati he, lekin mul rup se prabhas vahi kar rahe hai jo unke prashansakon ko sabase zyada pasand he—khaas andaaj main bure logon kii dhunaai
 They say that like Bahubali, action sequences in Saaho will also speed up the film
 dilachasp baat yah he ki prabhas film nirmaataa mani ratnam ko aadhunik romance kaa raja kehete hai
 The way he remembers his first and only meeting with Ratnam long before Bahubali in a lounge in Chennai reflects how big this superstar is as a director
 prabhas kehete hai, ''maine unase haath milaayaa or kaha, sar, main aapkaa bahut bada prashansak hum
 His last film at the domestic box office grossed over Rs 1,000 crore, yet there has been no difference in his behavior
 yah vinamrata jisane parade par unke charitron amrendra or mahendra bahubali ko logon ke dilon kaa raja banaaya, usee khubi ne prabhas ko janata kaa star bana diya
 Chatthatrapati (2005) 
S
 es
 His first film with Rajamouli, which led to him being an action hero's Banebilla (2009), was a remake of a hit Tamil thriller in which he portrayed both the hero and the villain
 parfect (2011)unhone is romantic film main ek bhramit premi ke kirdaar main darshakon ko stabdh kar diyamirchi (2013)ek or acshan film or bahubali se purv unki saphaltam filmbahubali: da bigining (2015) aurbahubali: da kanklusen (2017)in filmon main ek shoorveer raja kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke baad prabhas ke rup main ek neshnal star kaa udai hua

 Preet Bharara spokesman James Margolin denied the allegation of retaliation in Devyani's case, as stated in some circles in India

 wo chaahate hai ki is bill ko sthai samiti main bheja jaae taaki vahaan praavdhaanon par silsilewar dhang se vichaar ho sake or jarurat padane par vipakshi dal kuch sanshodhan bhi suza saken

 a division bench of Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice Deepak Mishra has said that the concept of good governance will be stronger at a time when public servants are confident that fairness will be imparted to them and their trust will not be hurt
 nyaayadhishon ne assam main karmchaariyon kii niyukti or tarakkee ke maamle main niyamon kaa sahi tareeke se paalan nahin karne ke liye rajya sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 The judges said that it is often argued that the government is an ideal employer and is therefore expected to act properly while respecting its rules
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki hameshaa yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki karmchaariyon kii vaazib aakankshaayen villopit nahin hon or aisi sthiti nahin utpann honi chahie jisamen unki ummid niraashaa main badal jaye
 Expectations are invaluable for everyone and the ideal employer should not convert their expectations into insidious and unfaithful by playing a game of chess in terms of their (employees) seniority
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne vishesh bhartee batch ke tahat niyukti ke maamle main niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya
 During this period, officers working in Assam Police Service were promoted in 1993-94
 vidhansabha chunaav main janata kaa bharosa jeetne ke liye aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne ab qamar kas lee he
 You MLA has started preparing the report card of the last 4 and a half years of work
 report card ke jariye 'aap' dilli main kejariwal sarkaar ke vikaas kaaryon kaa lekha-jokha ikattha karne main lagi hai
 Also in the past governments are busy making a book of the outstanding work of legislators of the opposing political parties
 sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya ye report card 'aap' vidhayakon ko dobaaraa tikat dilaane main madad karegaa? is bare main aaj tak ne aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon se baatcheet kii
 Report card being part of campaigning in upcoming assembly elections: a report card being prepared by Aam Aadmi Party mlas will also be part of campaigning in upcoming assembly elections
 chunavi ranneeti or report card par 'ajtak' ne sabase pehle buraadi vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak sanjeev jha se baatcheet kii
 AAP MLA Sanjeev Jha said that, 'aam Aadmi Party is trying to fulfill the promises made as soon as possible
 saath hi pichley paanch saal main jitne kaam kiye uski bhi puri report taiyaar kar rahe hai
 In this report, we will tell the people how many works the Aam Aadmi Party has done and what the other old mlas have not done
 chunaav se pehle report card ko janata ke saamne pesh karenge
 After this 'aaj Tak' interacted with Naresh Yadav, MLA from Mehrauli assembly constituency of Aam Aadmi Party
 'aap' vidhayak naresh yadav ne bataaya ki wo har saal apane ilaake main kiye kaam kii report taiyaar karte hai
 Describing the report card before the election, he said that, 'elections are to be held in the next few months, so we are preparing a report of the last four and a half years of functioning
 apane kaamkaaj kii salanaa report mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko dete rahete hai
 Our government has created a system in which every work of mlas is known
 'aise hi aam aadmi party ke timarpur vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak pankaj pushkar bhi ek report card banane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 When asked about the report card, 'AAP' MLA Pankaj Pushkar said, 'I think every MLA is evaluating his work in his own way and going among the public
 ham kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par apana ek report card taiyaar kar rahe hai
 They are preparing for the assembly elections just as they have to prepare before going to the examination
 saath hi report card party netritv ke saamne bhi rakhuunga
 However, will a report card for mlas prove to be a great weapon to win public confidence? Or will the party leadership or Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also select a candidate based on the functioning of the MLA in the upcoming assembly elections? When Aaj Tak asked these questions to the Aam Aadmi Party mlas, interesting answers came out
 report card par kya kehete hanvidhayakaburadi vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak sanjeev jha kaa kahana he ki, 'report card janata ko bataane ke liye he
 While the work of giving tickets is to the people above, the same tickets will be decided
 'report card ke aadhaar par tikat die jane ke sawaal par timarpur vidhansabha kshetra se 'aap' vidhayak pankaj pushkar ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki, 'mere khyaal se report card ko dekhakar hi tikat diye jane chahie
 Because we do not come from dynastic tradition, we come from a non-political lineage and all of us have got a chance to work in government with new ideas in a new way
 isliye report card ko jaanchane ke baad party netritv ko nirnay lenaa chahie
 AAP MLA Naresh Yadav from Mehrauli says that the ticket of election should be given on the basis of survey on the working of mlas
 'aap' vidhayak naresh yadav ne kaha, 'tikat katane kaa koi aadhaar nahi he
 It is important, what is the image of the MLA among the public? Will you be the winning MLA among the public? Every party should think whether a legislator can win on the basis of his 4 and a half years of work
 ek survey hona chahie, jiske aadhaar par tikat mili
 'the upcoming election can be a big challenge for the Aam Aadmi Party, which comes to power by winning 67 out of 70 seats in the 2015 assembly elections
 party kaa 70 point agenda jameen par kitna khara utraa, iskaa hisaab ab janata ke bich jaakar dene ke liye aam aadmi party ke vidhayak teji se kaam kar rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has also started programs like 'your MLA at your door' for the upcoming election
 haalanki party netritv kya chune hue vidhayakon main badlaav karegaa, yaa unhen dobaaraa mauka degaa, ye aane vaale dinon main hi saaf ho paaegaa
 But it is also to be seen here that how much the report card being prepared by the mlas to win the trust of the public, itself proves to be helpful in getting these mlas closer to the ticket

 jaisaa ki dow
 Farooq Abdullah said, "vajpayee's attitude to humanism, Jamhooriyat and Kashmiriyat exemplifies his greatness
 ''unhone kashmiriyon main aatmavishvaas bharaa or ummiden jagaain
 Kashmiris used to feel as if Vajpayee was someone from their midst
 kargil, qandahar or sansad par hamale ke baavjood, 1999 se 2004 ke bich kashmir main jo bhi sakaaraatmakataa dikhi, vah sab is jeniyas shaks kii vajah se thi
 The Kashmiris rejected terrorism because of Vajpayee's approach to humanism and his faith in it
 vaajapeyi ke liye kashmiriyon ke dilon main asaadhaaran prem or sammaan tha
 Once upon a time, the security forces were finding it difficult to find the terrorists hiding in the high reaches of Kashmir, then someone consulted that the gun on the chopper should be used but Vajpayee refused to do so

 The coordination between the intelligence agencies of the two countries was such that the ISI saved Musharraf's life on the basis of intelligence received from RAW
 general musharraf ne bhi iske liye shukriya adaa kiya tha
 If the 2002 election was a success, it was the result of Vajpayee's maximal participation thinking
 vaajapeyi kaa umr abdulla se bahut lagaav tha
 Vajpayee was looking at him as the future Chief Minister but Omar lost the election
 neshnal conference beshak sabase badi party bani par uske paas sarkaar banane laayak sankhya nahin thi
 But for the first time, separatists participated in the elections and also became a minister of the People's Conference in the PDP government
 yah sajaad lone ke mukhyadhara main aane kii shuruyaat bhi thi
 His father, Abdul Gani Lone, was considered the strongest leader among the separatist leaders and said that only Vajpayee could solve the Kashmir issue
 jaisaa ki mirwij umr faruk ne kaha, "vaajapeyi durlabh netaa the jo kashmir kii mushkilon kaa rasta, inasaaniyat ke saath talashne main yakeen rakhte the
 He made sincere efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue by offering unconditional dialogue with the Hurriyat

 In April 2003, in a promo in Srinagar, Vajpayee said that he twice extended a hand of friendship towards Pakistan but that he shook it both times; Yet they will not give up and offer another friendship
 kashmiri yah sunakar khushi se jhum rahe the
 Today we have stopped listening to Kashmiris, we need to make Vajpayee our role model

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar urged the central government to set up a new governing body without amending the relevant Act, requesting it not to tamper with the basic spirit of the 'idea of nalanda'
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko 5 disambar ko likhe ek patr main nalanda vishvavidhyalay ke kuladhipati jorge yo dwaara unke tyaagptr main vishvavidhyalay kii swaittata main centre ke hastkshep kaa zikr kiye jane kaa hawala dete hue nitish ne kaha, "centre sarkaar ko idia of nalanda kii mul bhaavana ke saath chhedchhad nahin kerani chahie
 " nitish ne kaha ki jorge yo ne shikaayat kii he ki vishvavidhyalay ke puraane shaasi nikaay ke vighatan or nae shaasi nikaay ke gathan sambandhi faislon par unhen vishwaas main nahin liya gaya
 In such a situation, it is a matter of difficulty to decide without consulting the Chancellor and raises questions about the autonomy of the said university
 unhone kaha ki aisa mahasoos kiya gaya ki nalanda vishvavidhyalay adhinium 2010 main shaasi nikaay ke gathan ko lekar praavdhaan trutipurna tha or centre sarkaar kaa daayitv tha ki ukt adhinium main sanshodhan karti
 In such a situation, the Central Government should have requested the Nalanda Mentor Group to remain in the Governing Body before the amendment
 nitish ne kaha ki nalanda vishvavidhyalay adhinium 2010 main abtak sanshodhan nahin hone tathaa bina salaah-mashvira ke centre sarkaar dwaara nae shaasi nikaay kaa gathan kar die jane se vishvavidhyalay kii pratishtha or vishwasaneeyata prabhavit hui he
 The comments unhone kaha ki jis prakaar se nalanda vishvavidhyalay kaa netritv kiya ja rahaa he, usko lekar usase sambandhit rahe sabhi log pareshaan hai

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In a letter dated December 5 to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, referring to the Centre's interference in the autonomy of the university by Nalanda University Chancellor George Yeo in his resignation, Nitish said, "the core of the idea of nalanda to the central government Should not tamper with emotion
 " Nitish said that George Yeo had complained that he was not taken into confidence in the decisions regarding the dissolution of the old governing body of the university and the formation of the new governing body
 aise main kuladhipati se bina vichaar-vimarsh ke nirnay lenaa dikkat kaa maamla he or ukt vishvavidhyalay kii swaittata ko lekar prashn khadaa karata he
 He said that it was felt that the provision regarding the formation of governing body in Nalanda University Act 2010 was flawed and it was the responsibility of the Central Government to amend the said Act
 aise main centre sarkaar ko sanshodhan ke purv nalanda menter group se anurodh karnaa chahie tha ki ve shaasi nikaay main bane rahen
 Nitish said that the Nalanda University Act 2010 has not been amended so far and the establishment of a new governing body by the central government without consultation has affected the reputation and credibility of the university

 In such a situation, it is a matter of difficulty to decide without consulting the Chancellor and raises questions about the autonomy of the said university
 unhone kaha ki aisa mahasoos kiya gaya ki nalanda vishvavidhyalay adhinium 2010 main shaasi nikaay ke gathan ko lekar praavdhaan trutipurna tha or centre sarkaar kaa daayitv tha ki ukt adhinium main sanshodhan karti
 In such a situation, the Central Government should have requested the Nalanda Mentor Group to remain in the Governing Body before the amendment
 nitish ne kaha ki nalanda vishvavidhyalay adhinium 2010 main abtak sanshodhan nahin hone tathaa bina salaah-mashvira ke centre sarkaar dwaara nae shaasi nikaay kaa gathan kar die jane se vishvavidhyalay kii pratishtha or vishwasaneeyata prabhavit hui he

 ) He said that it was felt that the provision regarding the formation of governing body in Nalanda University Act 2010 was flawed and it was the responsibility of the Central Government to amend the said Act
 aise main centre sarkaar ko sanshodhan ke purv nalanda menter group se anurodh karnaa chahie tha ki ve shaasi nikaay main bane rahen
 Nitish said that the Nalanda University Act 2010 has not been amended so far and the establishment of a new governing body by the central government without consultation has affected the reputation and credibility of the university
 tippaniyan He said that the manner in which Nalanda University is being led, everyone concerned about it is upset

 Britain-born writer Atish Ali Taseer is accused of concealing information that his father was of Pakistani origin
 bataa den ki taasir ne TIME magazine main pradhanmantri narendra modi par lekh likhte hue unhen 'divyder in chif' kaha tha
 After the cancellation of OCI, Taseer has made his case known through TIME
 jaaniye kya kaha unhone
 India's Ministry of Home Affairs letter came in September 2019
 meri maa ne us letters kaa sandesh whatsap se bheja, jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki bharat sarkaar meri oversij citigenship of india (osiai) ko radd kar rahi he, kyonki bharat dohari rashtriyata ko manyata nahin detaa or osiai (bhartiya mul ke vyaktiyon ke liye ek sthaayee vija) kareeb-kareeb dohari naagarikta ke aasapaas kaa darja he
 i had 21 days to answer and claim them, but when i received the letter it was the 20th day
 agar main jawaab nahin detaa to yah maan liya jaataa ki mere paas kuch kehane ke liye nahin he or phir meraa osiai radd kar diya jayega
 But after receiving the letter, i immediately responded to his claim via email, which reached out to the Indian Ambassador to New York
 iske baad isaki hard copy grih mantralay ko saunpi gai
 On November 7, Kod said that my claim is being reviewed
 ab sarkaar ne twitor ke jariye ghoshnaa kii ki meri oversij citigenship of india ko radd kar diya he, jo maine pehali baar suna
 'I was called the PR manager of the Congress' When the Lok Sabha elections in India were at the peak in May 2019, i wrote an article for TIME, which was critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 time patrika ne piem narendra modi ko "india's Divider in Chief" yani kii 'bharat kaa pramukh vibhaajankaree' bataaya
 This image of Modi showed a lot of anger among his supporters
 iske baad hafte bhar main logon ne mere bare main vikipedia par galat jaankaree daal di or mujh par congress party ke liye bataur piaar prabandhak kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 People followed me on social media, many people were threatening to kill me and my meme was being spread on social media as a Pakistani bandit
 achaanak se mujhe pashchimi agent ke rup main bhi chitrit kiya gaya
 i am dyed western, i am English-speaking, i am part of the upper class, but apart from this there was another reason for attack on me which made me sensitive
 mere pita kaa janm british bharat main ek british mata-pita se hua tha
 He later became Pakistani after the country was divided
 time story pakistani ne likhi he: patratime patrika main mere lekh prakashit hone ke 24 ghante ke andar bijepi ke pravaktaa sambit paatra ne hamalaa bolaa
 Addressing a press conference, Patra said that Time Story is written by a Pakistani and nothing better can be expected from Pakistan
 yah khatarnaak or galat bayaan tha
 Patra had said that the writer belongs to a political house in Pakistan, which is sufficient for credibility
 main baahar janma or jab tak main 21 saal kaa nahin hua, tab tak main pita ke sampark main nahin tha
 Having been in India since the age of 2, i was born under British rule and i have UK citizenship
 main 2 saal kii umr se apni maa ke saath bharat main rahaa or vahiin bada hua
 My Indian mother who is a well-known journalist
 unhone mujhe dilli main paala or wo mere liye ekmaatr kanoonee abhibhavak raheen
 i knew my mother as a parent for most of my life
 yahi kaaran he ki main mujhe hameshaa bharat main bhartiya ke rup main dekha gaya or yahi vajah thi ki mujhe osiai diya gaya tha
 The story of my parents' emotional connection was also the subject of my first book 'stranger to History', which was published in 2009 and reviewed extensively in India
 main us samay bharat main hi rah rahaa tha
 From that time until September, the government has never inquired and no challenge was given
 maine gusse or pratishodh kii apeksha to kii thi, lekin gambhirtha se nahin
 However, the government did not initially reveal the reason behind this action
 ab jaakar mere osiai ko radd karne ke apane kaarnon ko bataaya ki maine is tathy ko chupaaya ki mere pita pakistani mul ke the, lekin ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki jo time patrika main maine likhaa uske liye mujhe dandit kiya gaya

 It is strange to think that a wife should get her husband murdered and stand by herself and watch everything live
 tab tak dekhati rahe jab tak ki pati dam naa tod de
 And then after the death of the same husband, wept for two days so that the hearts of the bus watchers would be upset
 laalchee bivi kii khaufnak sajishapahale us aurat ko ishk hua
 Then Ishq blinds him
 apane hi haathon se usne apane ashiq ko khanjar diya
 The woman herself picked up her one and a half year old daughter
 or iske baad apni ankhon ke saamne apane pati ko marate hue dekhati rahi
 She was watching the scene of death and her innocent daughter kept crying
 yahi he surat kii ek laalchee bivi kii kaufanaak kahani
 The wife had hatched the murders of murders in that house
 ghar main jawan maut hui thi
 The owner of the house was killed
 lihaaja har koi udhaas or sogvaar tha
 Within a few years of marriage, that beautiful girl had become pregnant
 har koi uske dukh kii baat kar rahaa tha
 His crying was making everyone cry
 kyonki uski to duniya hi lut gai thi
 But two days later, the police finally caught the murderer
 jab kaatil ko saamne laayaa gaya to har koi hairaan rah gaya
 That murderer was the beautiful wife of no one else to die
 hakeekat saamne aane par sab hairaan rah gaye
 ALSO READ: In the passion of Ishq, this man had created a creepy conspiracy to cheat the family
 Someone has told the truth that don't go in anyone's face
 cheharaa achche-acchon ko dhokhaa de jaataa he
 Just think, for 48 hours, the family, friends and relatives kept trying to silence them with comfort, the same secret was keeping the world in their hearts
 kaise aansu chhalkaa rah thi
 Do not know from where she was bringing this tear? The false story told to the police came out of the story of Gujarat which is another wound to human relations
 ek bivi apane hi aashiq ke haathon apane shuhar kaa katl karwaati he
 She not only gets murdered but also keeps herself standing till the last moment to see if she is dead or not
 phir usne police or duniyaavaalon ke liye ek kahani gadhi
 She continued acting on that story with full sincerity for two days
 roti rahi, behosh hoti rahi, bhukhi-pyaasi rahi
 So that the people of the world would feel that there was nothing more shocking for her than the death of her husband
 par jab sach saamne aayaa to anjaam hathkadi bana or ilzaam katl kaa
