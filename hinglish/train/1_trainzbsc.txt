 ) sheri paaji or maharaja kaa jhagada ab congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke darbar main ja pahunchaa he
 Yes, we are talking about Navjot Singh Sidhu and Congress Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh who came to the Congress before the election from BJP
 darasal, amritsar se saansad rahe siddhu, jab congress main aae to unke saath unke samarthak damandeep bhi party main shaamil hue
 Now, Sidhu pressurized the Captain to make Damandeep the Mayor of Amritsar in order to seek his dominance in Amritsar
 lekin captain amarinder singh ne siddhu kii ek naa suni
 The Captain made it clear that the old Congressmen would be preferred
 iske baad siddhu ne sadasyon ke jariye takat dikhaane kii bhi koshish kii, lekin sankhya bal captain ke haq main rahaa
 In such a situation, angry Siddhu asked for time to meet Rahul Gandhi and complain
 guuruuvaar ko siddhu rahul se mili to shikaayat karne ke liye the, lekin ulate rahul ne siddhu se naaraazgi jataa di
 This was the moment that Sidhu might not have expected
 vaise bhi siddhu jab congress main shaamil hue the, tab ahm bhoomika or sari baatcheet priyanka gandhi ke jariye hui thi
 Rahul had just stamped
 lekin ab rahul bataur adhyaksh siddhu se mukhaatib the
 It happened that Sidhu had submitted his report to Rahul before Sidhu came to complain about the captain
 captain ne apni report main saaf kaha ki siddhu sirf amritsar main apana dabadabaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, he wants to make his supporter Damandeep the mayor of the place, who is just a loyal devotee, is not even active in politics
 jabaki congress ke puraane netaa pehle se qatari main hai
 At the same time, Sidhu was also trying to create a split in the party for this, which failed
 captain kii report main ek khaas baat kaa zikr kiya gaya ki siddhu ne himachal or gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main kehane ke baavjood prachaar nahin kiya
 This is especially true for Rahul
 darasal, himachal bilkul punjab se sata hua he
 Despite the demand, Sidhu did not go there to campaign
 prabharee aashaa kumari ne siddhu se prachaar karne ko kaha, lekin siddhu ne nazarandaaj kar diya
 After this, the matter reached to Rahul and on the day of Rahul's nomination for the post of party president on December 4, when Sidhu came to the Congress headquarters, Rahul himself asked Sidhu not to campaign in Himachal Pradesh and further directed him to campaign in Gujarat
 lekin party or rahul ko dhata bataate hue siddhu himachal ke baad gujarat main bhi chunaav prachaar karne nahin gaye
 The Gujarat election was very close to Rahul
 rahul ne vahaan puraa jor lagaaya
 However, the Congress lost the election with a narrow margin
 aise main gujarat main siddhu kaa prachaar karne nahin janaa rahul ko bhi nagavar gujara
 That is why Navjot Singh wanted to express his displeasure with the captain when Sidhudilli came, but on the contrary, he returned after hearing Rahul's displeasure
 shaayad kah sakate hai ki team india kaa ye openar punjab kii siyaasi pich par rahul darbar main aayaa to chakka maarane tha, lekin khud hi hit wicket ho gaya

 meghna ne 'philhal' jaisi film darshakon tak pahunchaai he or uske baad 'just marid' or saal 2007 main 'das kahaniyaan' film bhi kii he
 Meghna has made the film after 8 years in the wake of the famous Aarushi murder case investigation
 ab kya meghna apni baat purnatah janata tak pahunchaa pai hai? aaie film kii samiksha karte hai
 The story of the film is based on the investigation of Aarushi Murder Case in 2008 in Noida, adjacent to Delhi
 yah kahani tandon danpati kii he, jisamen ramesh tandon (niraj kabi), nutan tandon (konkana sen) apni beti shruti tandon ke saath rahete hai
 Shruti is murdered the same night with the house servant Khempal, who is first investigated by the police and later by the CDI officer Ashwin Kumar (irrfan Khan) and three types of investigations are presented
 scriptfilm kii kahani khudvishaal bharadwaj ne likhi he or unhone aarushi murderces kii jaanch main saamne aae mukhya binduon par prakaash daalane kii purajor koshish kii he
 There are also special comments on 3 different decisions in the story
 pita-beti, maa-beti, mata-pita, mata-pita-beti or naukar, in sabhi ke filmakan ko dekhakar lagata he kii is film kii likhaawat ke peeche kaaphi research hui he
 Vishal has left no stone unturned at the script level
 aakhri ke 12 minute or dilachasp lagate hai
 Dialogues sometimes make you laugh
 abhinayais film kii sabase badi jeet isaki casting he
 Irrfan Khan, Neeraj Kabi, Konkona Sen, one actor more than the other, have set the example of very good acting, while in a special role, Tabu once again explained why he is called the best actress
 ek pita ke kirdaar main niraj kabi or maa kaa abhinay kar rahi konkana ne kaaphi marmasparshi acting kii he
 At the same time, preparations for the acting of Irfan Khan, who are engaged in the work of investigation, have also paid off
 film main actors kii khaasiyat hi ise kam gambhir or zyada dilachasp banaati he
 The music of the music film has also played a very important role
 gulzaar kii likhaawat or vishaal bharadwajka sangeet karnpriy he or wo kahani ko aage lekar chalata he
 Although there is no lip syncing song, but whenever there is alaap in the background, you are tied to the story
 rekha bharadwaj kaa gaaya geet bhi chhu jaataa he
 a weak link is only a weak link of a film, when there is a switch from one probe to another
 tisare level kii jaanch kamjor si lagati he
 After Irrfan Khan's investigation process, Atul Kumar's track seems to be lighter
 kyon dekhembehtareen acting, satya ghatana par aadhaarit kahani ke aap shaukeen hai, to ye film bilkul miss naa karen
 The sword forces you to think

 Federer has reached the final of Wimbledon for the 8th time
 dekhnaa he ki antim baaji kiske haath aati he
 It is not necessary for anyone to love you, it is necessary for your life to be in love
 kuch aise hi diwane hote honge jo 'leh' main tamaam dikkaton ke baavjood bas apane pyaar se milane pahunch jate hai
 Now what are these problems, someone will definitely tell you before going there
 oxigen kii kami, moolbhoot suvidhaon kaa abhaav, lambe din or vaqt bitaane ke bahaane kam
 So friends will definitely take you
 khayr, main ghoomane-phirane kii shauqin bilkul nahin hum lekin is saal sochaa he ki kuch jagahen zarur dekhni hai
 So it was decided to go to Leh first
 hawaii jahaaz se sirf 1 ghante kaa safar he
 Most travel enthusiasts like to go on a bike and it takes about 15 days to roam the entire leh like this
 jaise hi subah leh airport par utre, ankhon ne jaise koi jam pi liya tha or jo dikh rahaa tha wo bas nasha tha
 It was said that it should rest as soon as it reaches Leh because it is situated at a very high altitude
 aapako mausam ke saath talmail baitaane main dikkat hoti he
 i felt sleepy as soon as i went because i had not slept the first night
 uthne ke baad sab dost baahar nikle or paas hi shanti stupa kii or bade
 There was such a beautiful view around that they used to lie on the road
 kya karen, nasha aisa hi to hota he
 That is why people who drink alcohol and cigarettes were not found there
 ek hi jagah par aapako registan, pahaad, nadiyaan, chattaane, or ek hi din main aapako barfabaari, dhoop, chhaanv, barish dekhne ko mil jaye to aap yahi kahenge ki leh, tum khuda kaa modern art ho
 In the end, God would have made Leh and shown all his artwork
 yahaan rang zyaada nahin hai, shades hai
 Sheds of mountains, sheds of rocks
 ladakiyon ke kapadon kii almaari main bhi itane shades nahin hote
 If someone comes here, then surely the next dress will match the shades of the litigants here
 doodh se zyaada ujali barf
 Not yellow like Kufri
 acha he yahaan wo khachchar kii sawari nahin hoti
 Otherwise you start remembering your metro city in that smell
 raat ko chand yahaan kuch zyaada hi meharbaan hota he
 Clouds can be seen comfortably in the night sky
 chinar ke ped bhi antina kii tarah khadey hokar ishaara de rahe hote hai ki haa, yahi he wo jagah jahaan dhoop or chandani ko zyaada barasana he
 This place is only for the crazy people who either love yayavari or peace
 ye jagah un logon ke liye bilkul nahin he jo shimla, manali jaisi kisi jagah kii ummid kar rahe hote hai or khaali packet sadakon par phenk kar apni buree yaaden in vaadiyon ke liye chhod jate hai
 There are many places to see in Leh but there is no place where you go and feel what a place
 yahaan ke raste hi hai jo khubasurat hai
 So beautiful that you don't want to reach anywhere
 bas chalate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Even the fun of life lasts only till it reaches the destination
 phir bhi agar janaa chahen to magnetic hill jaaen or jaadu dekhen ki kaise koi pahaad aapaki band gaadi ko khinch rahaa hota he
 Leh Palace
 kuch puraane buddha math hai
 There is a war museum where some remnants of the indo-pakistani battles are preserved
 pang gong nadi kii kubsuurati to aap sabhi ne kai filmon main dekh hi lee hogi
 One morning, due to lack of oxygen, the eyes opened quickly, and listening to Ajan, i was not sure
 buddha dharm kaa prasar to vahaan khub hua hi he lekin ek baat jo dekhne laayak he wo ye ki vahaan santoshi mata mandir, gurudwara, masjid sab maujuud hai
 In a place where the population is not even 1
5 lakh, almost all the main religions have found their followers
 jaise tivi par aane vaale har bande ko twitor foloar mil hi jate hai
 Most of the people also speak Hindi
 kuch kuch angreji bhi
 Now here Rosi-roti mainly runs on tourism, so people had to learn Hindi
 ye bataata he ki bhashaa hamaari zarurat he, garv kaa kaaran nahin
 But its dignity, pride continues to be debated the day it arrives
 yahaan ke logon main kaaphi eemaandaaree he
 If you will bring to Khaddung, which is the highest road in the world where you can drive, even at such a height you will get 10 rupees of chocolate for 10 rupees only
 bataane ko to kaaphi kuch he, lekin yahaan se sirf reating le jaaiye or khud jaakar hairaan hoie ki kya isse khubasurat bhi kuch or hoga
 If you are making a bucket list of your own, then include Leh
 ye modern art aapaki yaadon main hameshaa ke liye chap jayega

 In the Union Cabinet meeting held on Monday, it has been decided that now 10% reservation will be given to upper castes
 ye aarakshan aarthik rup se kamjor savarnon ko diya jayega
 Please tell that the way the Modi government overturned the Supreme Court's decision regarding the SC / ST Act in 2018, the upper caste was being said to be very angry
 mana ja rahaa he ki mangalvaar ko modi sarkaar samvidhan sanshodhan bill sansad main pesh kar sakati he
 Let us know that Tuesday is the last day of the winter session of Parliament
 kinhen milegaa laabh?jis vyakti ke paas tay seemaa se adhik sampatti hogi, use is sanshodhan kaa laabh nahin mil paaegaa
 If sources are to be believed, these reservations can be given to upper castes having income of 8 lakhs per annum and land of less than 5 acres
 iske alaava jinke paas sarkari jameen (DDA, nigam kii jameen) par apana makaan hoga, unhen bhi iskaa laabh nahin mil paaegaa
 All these will be benefited> Those whose annual income is less than 8 lakhs> Those who have less than 5 hectares of cultivated land> Those who have a house of less than 1000 square feet> Those who have less than 109 yards of notified land of the corporation> Those who have a non-notified land of the corporation of less than 209 yards> who were not yet covered under any kind of reservation will have to make changes in the constitution

 Do not order rice

 For this, changes will be made in Article 15 and Article 16 of the Constitution
 donon anuchhed main badlaav kar aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kaa rasta saaf ho jayega

 It was believed that the upper castes were very angry with this decision of the Modi government

 After this decision of the central government, political reactions have started coming
 yahaan padhein sabhi raajnneetik dalon, netaaon kii pratikriyaayein
 
 
 Ami Yagnik of congress-congress says that there are a lot of technical problems on this type of reservation, what is the purpose of giving such reservation before Lok Sabha elections

 After the refusal of many state governments, now the central government has called a meeting today about its ambitious plan 'modi Care'
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne is saal ke bajet main 50 karod logon ko swasthya sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke liye'ayushmaan bharat'naam se yojana kaa elaan kiya
 It was claimed that this government scheme providing health services to the people would be the largest scheme of its kind in the world
 is yojana ko jameen par kaise utaara jayega, iske liye sarkaar ne kavayad shuru kar di he
 The central government has called a meeting of health secretaries of all states on Thursday
 is baithak main swasthya yojana ko lagu karne ke taur-tareekon par maathapai hogi
 Officials of the Central Government and NITI Aayog will also be present in the two-day meeting
 'modi care'ke naam se prachlit neshnal health protection skim ke tahat 10 karod pariwaron ko yani kareeb 50 karod logon ko har saal 5 lakh rupee tak kaa swasthya beemaa muhaiyaa karaane kaa lakshya he, lekin abhi tak yah faisla nahin ho paaya he yojana ko kaise lagu kiya jayega
 After the announcement of the plan in the budget speech, health experts including the opposition also questioned it
 unka kahana tha ki yojana ke liye sarkaar ne bajet main sirf 2000 karod rupee kaa aavanton kiya he
 With this, how is it possible to provide health insurance to so many people
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki centre sarkaar is yojana ke tahat chaahati he ki rajya sarkarein is par aane vaale kharch kaa 40 fisadi hissaa vahan kare
 The central government itself is ready to bear 60 per cent of the plan
 kai rajyon ne jhaada pallaayojna ko lekar kuch rajya sarkaron ne pallaa bhi jhaad liya he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that she will not implement the 'ayushman Bharat' program in her state
 unki daleel he ki unhen ye paise kii barbaadi lagata he or pehle se hi rajya sarkaar kii taraf se pashchim bengal main ek swasthya beemaa yojana chal rahi he
 Some other states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana also have different types of health insurance schemes already in place
 aise main jin rajyo main bijepi kii sarkaar nahin he, wo centre sarkaar kii is mahatvakankshi yojana kaa hissaa banenge yaa nahin, ye kahana mushkil he
 The central government also has to decide which diseases will be covered under the health insurance scheme
 niti ayog ke sutron ke mutabik ye saaf he ki 5 lakh rupee main har tarah kii beemaari ko beemaa yojana main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Preparations to be launched before the general elections, discussions are still underway on what should be the model of giving premiums for implementing health insurance scheme
 kuch rajyon ne swasthya beemaa ke liye trust bana rakhaa he jabaki kuch jagahon par beemaa companiyaan premium ke badale yah suvidha muhaiyaa karaati hai
 According to sources, the government wants to implement the scheme from August 15 or October 2, but its preparations are not yet completed
 mana ja rahaa he ki pehle sarkaar kuch rajyon main ise lagu karegi or phir baad main puure desh main iskaa vistaar kiya jayega
 The Lok Sabha elections are due in 2019 and the BJP government will definitely want that the scheme be implemented before the elections so that the BJP can get its benefit during the elections

 Under the powers given to the Commission, this Commission of Inquiry will suggest what changes are needed in the law, in what ways fast action should be taken in such cases and in what way the provisions of the existing law and recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee are correctly Applicable so that such cases do not recur
 tippaniyan Let us tell you that in July 2015 in Delhi, a girl named Minakshi was murdered in the Anand Parbat area, after which the Delhi government had passed a proposal to constitute an inquiry commission calling the assembly session

 Amid a sharp depreciation of the rupee and the stock markets, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that sufficient foreign capital reserves are available to stem the currency exchange market's decline
 rajan ne yahaan ek banking sammelan ke itar maukey par kaha ki desh ke paas kareeb 380 arab dollar videshi puunji bhandar he or yadi jarurat padi to iskaa istemaal kiya jayega
 The rupee hit 66 in the currency exchange market on Monday
 47 kaa do saal kaa nichalaa str chhu liya
 Rajan had earlier said on one occasion that RBI is not the cheer leader of the country's economy
 isi kii tarj par unhone phir kaha ki share bazaar main teji laane kaa kaam arabiai kaa nahin he
 Rajan said, "the reduction in key rates should not be seen as a money that RBI gives after much fanfare
 " Rajan said, "rather, it is important that inflation remains low, which was also discussed by the Prime Minister in a speech given on the occasion of Independence Day
 aisa hone par arabiai ko dar ghataane main koi hichak nahin hogi
 " rajan ne kaha, "vaishvik arthvyavastha kii niraashajanak haalat ke baavjood bhartiya arthvyavastha sambhaavnaaon se bhari hui he
 The main reason for the weakness of the global economy is that immediate solutions in those economies have been given attention, not long-term reforms
 " Rajan said, "the root cause of the economic problems of recent years is that India has shortened its institutions
 tikaoo vikaas ke liye sarkaar or arabiai ke kadamon kaa saar yah he ki ham jaruri santhaan khadey kar rahe hai
 " vaishvik vyapaar main giravat ke bare main rajan ne kaha ki vaishvik bazaar main teji or giravat par adhik dhyaan nahin dekar gharelu bazaar main maang badhaane par dhyaan dena chahie
 He said that structural reforms should be done to increase the demand in the domestic market
 tippaniyan Rajan said that licenses for two new small finance banks would be issued next month and two general banks would start
 rajan ne kaha ki arabiai kii taatkaalik praathamikta mahangaai kam karnaa or sankat main fansi pariyojnaon ko aage badhaane ke liye sarkaar or bainkon ke saath milakar kaam karnaa tathaa bainkon kaa balanceshit thik karnaa he
 Rajan said on the sidelines of a banking conference here that the country has about $ 380 billion in foreign capital reserves and will be used if needed
 somvaar ko mudra vinimay bazaar main rupee ne prati dollar 66
 Touched a two-year low of 47

 Tiwari is the national president of the Hindu Mahasabha
 ve kehete hai ki murti kii praan-pratishtha 30 janvari 2015 ko karaayenge, jis din gandhi ji kii hatya hui thi
 When he was talking to the media about one and a half thousand people of the village were also on the spot
 mandir ban paaegaa yaa nahin, abhi kahana mushkil he
 Because the police-administration has come to warn the villagers that if such a temple is built, they will take action against all the people associated with it under Rasuka
 khayr, jo baat puure desh main faili he, vah yah ki kahin godse kii pratimaa sthapit kii ja rahi he
 What does this mean - Born in Baramati, Maharashtra, Godse is being described as great in Sitapur, saying that Gandhiji was doing injustice to Hindus and Godse stopped him by firing 3 bullets
 - godse ne 1940 main usee samay muslim lig or uski raajnneeti kaa virodh shuru kiya
 Nazism was at its peak in Germany during this period
 - kabhi gandhi ji ke savinay avagya andolan se jude godse ne ugravadi sanghathan hindu raashtra dal banaaya
 They also started opposing Gandhiji's fasting programs
 godse maanate the ki aisa karke gandhi ji muslimon kaa paksh lete hai or hinduon kii upeksha karte hai
 Nathuram Godse's brother Gopal Godse writes in his book that Gandhi's attitude towards partition of the country disturbed his brother the most
 gandhi ji na sirf bantwaare kaa samarthan kar rahe the balki pakistan kii us maang kaa bhi samarthan kar rahe the, jisamen vah bharat se 55 hajaar karod rupee maang rahaa tha
 Godse created the role of Gandhiji's murder, saying that if Gandhiji stays, he will get the country further divided in the name of caste and religion

 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has again come under bjp's target
 pehle unhone modi sarkaar ke 2019 main jeetne par bharat ke hindu pakistan banane kii baat kahi to ab unka kahana he ki bijepi hindutv kaa talibanikaran karnaa chaahati he
 The BJP is constantly besieging Tharoor, Congress and Rahul Gandhi for these statements but Tharoor himself is unfazed by this
 tharur kaa kahana he ki unhone koi bayaan galat nahin diya he
 He said who are the BJP people who will drive me away from this country
 main bhi is desh kaa naagarik hum or ek janpratinidhi hone ke naate mujhe puraa haq he apni raay rakhane kaa
 We do not want this country to become a country like Pakistan
 ye hindutv ke log hamaare desh ko hindu raashtra bananaa chaahate hai
 Shashi Tharoor said that these people are spoiling the freedom struggle of our country
 pakistan ke logon kii soch majahab ke naam par desh banane kii he, lekin ham kabhi aisa nahin soch sakate
 Those involved in the freedom movement also thought that this country would be for everyone
 hindu samudaay ke log bhi yahi kahenge ki ham chaahate hai ki desh main sabhi log ek saath rahen
 Then who are the people of BJP who say that a person of different opinions cannot live in this India
 shashi tharur kaa kahana he ki talibani soch kahati he ki jo unka vichaar nahin maanate, unako maarna chahie
 In this country all opinions should go together, not one opinion
 1947 main jab pakistan bana, vah ek majahab ke logon ke liye bana
 At that time Indian leaders never said that India should be of a religion
 tharur ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki sabhi majahab ke log is desh main rahen, sabhi bharatvasiyon ko ek hi haq mili or sabko jeene ke ek hi adhikaar praapt hon
 i am talking about what is written in the constitution
 pradhanmantri narendra modi samvidhan ko pavitra kitaab kehete hai to wo kahen ki ham hindu raashtra nahin banaaenge
 Our constitution is paramount in the country and should be followed
 tharur ne kaha ki bharat sabake liye he
 Is for all religions, for all castes and all communities
 kisi ek vyakti vishesh ke liye hindustan nahin he
 Just as Pakistan became a Muslim country, they want to make this country a Hindu Pakistan
 lekin main is desh ko pakistan nahin banane dena chahta
 Shashi Tharoor said that the talk of BJP people about creating a 'hindu Rashtra' is very dangerous
 ye soch desh ko nasht kar degi
 Let me tell you that while speaking at a party function in Kerala last week, Tharoor said that if the BJP wins again in the 2019 elections, the Constitution will be in danger
 bijepi apane 'hindu raashtra' siddhant ke tatwon ko samahit karne ke liye sabakuch karegi
 By doing this India will become 'hindu Pakistan'
 isse pehle shashi tharur ke hindutv ko lekar die bayaan par kendriya mantri ashvini choube ne unhempakistan jane kii naseehatade daali or kaha ki vah khud talibani he
 Choubey said that Tharoor should tell if he is a Taliban
 agar is desh main rahanaa he to hindutv ko gaali nahin di ja sakati, desh ko gaali nahin di ja sakati
 Ashwani Choubey said that if someone abuses Hindutva while living in the country, then he should go to Pakistan
 aise logon ke liye is desh main koi jagah nahin he
 Choubey says that the Supreme Court has also said that Hindutva is the way of life
 isiilie shashi tharur kaa bayaan thik nahin he
 Ashwani Choubey made a controversial statement on Shashi Tharoor as well as Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki unki party ke jo mukhiya babua he vah bhi congress ko barbaad karne main lage hai
 Congress is trying to free the country

 maharashtra main bijepi ke pratyaashiyon kii do suchi jaridusri suchi main bhi nitesh rane kaa naam nahinarayan rane ne kaha tha- bijepi se ladenge niteshmaharashtra vidhansabha chunaav dilachasp mode par pahunch gaya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena alliance have released the list of their candidates
 bijepi ne ab tak 139 pratyaashiyon kii do suchi jari kii hai, lekin hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki in donon soochiyon se party ke kai diggaj gaayab hai
 Not only this, the name of Nitesh Rane, son of former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, who left the Congress and joined the BJP has also not been announced yet
 isse bhi zyada chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki bijepi ke tikat par rajyasabha pahunche narayan rane ne buudhvaar ko hi yah bayaan diya tha ki unke bete nitesh bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladenge or party kii duusari suchi main unka naam ghoshit kar diya jayega
 Narayan Rane had said that Nitesh will contest from Kankavali seat
 haalanki, buudhvaar shaam jab bijepi kii duusari suchi saamne ai to narayan rane kaa daawa galat sabit ho gaya
 BJP announced the names of 14 candidates in its second list, but Nitesh Rane was not included in it
 pehali list main ghoshit kiye the 125 pratyaasheeisase pehle party 125 pratyaashiyon ke naam ghoshit kar chuki he
 In this regard, BJP has so far announced a total of 139 names
 lekin ekanath khadse, vinod taavade or prakaash mehta jaise bade naam bhi abhi shaamil nahin kiye gaye hai
 Khadse has also made his nomination after the first list
 haalanki, dilachasp baat ye bhi he ki bijepi ne in netaaon kii maujuuda siton par ab tak kisi duusare pratyaashee kaa naam bhi ghoshit nahin kiya he
 That is, these seats are still vacant
 aise main ab jabaki namakan ke liye guuruuvaar or shuukravaar kaa din bachaa he, to yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki bijepi in bade chehron ko mauka detii he yaa nahin

 Sports Minister Ajay Maken said that if the International Olympic Committee refuses to remove Dow Chemical from the list of sponsors of the London Olympic Games, the players' role will be crucial in deciding whether India will boycott the Games

 The Sports Minister said, "there is no confusion in the minds of the players
 agar ham khilaadiyon se salaah mashvira shuru kar den to kya ham bhram paidaa nahin karenge
 The role of the players is very important in this
 ’unhone kaha, ‘khilaadi kya mahasoos karte hai, isaki hamaare faisle main ahm bhoomika hogi

 We have not decided on it yet
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas yojana he lekin abhi yojana kaa khulaasa kyon karen
 Maken insisted that the government had not yet decided whether Indian officials would boycott the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane ab tak is par faisla nahin kiya he
 i cannot say anything about this
 ham is mudde par bhopal ke logon or saath hi khilaadiyon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhenge
 The Sports Minister said, "we do not want to choose one of these two
" jahaan tak taiyaariyon kaa sawaal he to hamaari taiyaariyaan joro par chal rahi hai

 i still hope that we will be able to find a solution
 ’maakan ne kaha ki agar dou ko praayojak ke rup main nahin hataaya gaya to iskaa matlab hoga ki olympic bhaavana par nahin chalaa gaya

 prashanth kishor ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii twit par tippanee karte hue kaha ki congress kaa netritv is mudde par sadakon par nahin he
 Apart from this, the top leaders of the party also appear to be missing in the struggle against CAA and NRC
 prashanth kishor ne kaha ki congress kam se kam itnaa to kar sakati he ki jin rajyon main congress kii sarkaar he vahaan ke mukhyamantri un mukhyamantriyon ke saath aaen jinhone kaha he ki ve apane rajyon main enarasi lagu nahin karenge
 Let us know that on Friday, Sonia Gandhi tweeted that the Citizenship Amendment Act is discriminatory
 notebandi kii tarah ek baar phir ek-ek vyakti ko apni evam apane purvajon kii naagarikta sabit karne ke liye line main khadaa hona padegaa
 Prashant Kishore commented on this tweet from Sonia Gandhi, advising pk's Sonia, "the Congress party is not on the road today and the party's top leadership has also been missing from the fight fought by ordinary citizens against CAA and NRC
 kam se kam aap apane sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko baaki rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke saath judane ko kahie, jo apane rajyon menbenshchhlagu karne ke kilaaf he
 Otherwise, these statements have no meaning whatsoever
 Congress is not on streets and its top leadership has been largely absent in the citizens’ fight against caa-nrcthe least party could do it to make ALL Congress cms join other cms who have said that they will not allow NRC in their states
 Or else these statements means nothinghttps: / / t

 input language sant asaram baapu ek baar phir vivaadon main aa gaye hai
 This time the reason for the controversy is to kick a devotee

 The comments asaram baapu somvaar ko satsang main hissaa lene aae the
 Bapu was among the devotees after the discourse, when the elderly Aman Singh Dangi tried to touch the feet, when Bapu kicked instead of blessing Dangi
 aman kaa kahana he ki vah baapu kaa aashirwad lene gaye the, magar unhen laat maare jane se vah aahat hai

 pravachan ke baad baapu bhakton ke bich the, tabhi bujurg aman singh dangi ne charan sparsh karne kii koshish kii, tabhi baapu ne dangi ko aashirwad dene kii bajaay laat maar di
 Aman says that he went to seek Bapu's blessings, but he is hurt by being kicked
 is vajah se beeti raat unhen neend nahin ai
 He is unable to understand why Bapu did this even though he has been a devotee of Bapu for many years
 aman kaa kahana he ki vah baapu kaa aashirwad lene gaye the, magar unhen laat maare jane se vah aahat hai
 Because of this, he could not sleep last night

 Now Saif's daughter Sara Ali Khan is working with director Imtiaz Ali
 mana ja rahaa he ki imtiyaaj kii agali film, lav aaj kal kaa hi sikval he
 Fans are waiting to know whether they will get to see the story in this film or what kind of connection this film has with the original film
 jahaan diarector imtiyaaj ali apni film ke bare main philhal koi baat nahin kar rahe hai, vahiin saf ne bataaya ki unhen nahin lagata ki ye nai film unki lav aaj kal ko aage badhayegi
 Talking to Hindustan Times, Saif said about the Sara and Karthik Aryan starrer film that he too does not know much about the film and is hoping that Imtiaz Love will show different storylines from Aaj Kal
 saf ne kaha, "mujhe nahin lagata ki is film main lav aaj kal kii kahani ko aage badhaayaa jayega
 If that were the case, it would have depended on the thinking of the producers and i might have been producing this film
 aisa nahin hua he
 Imtiaz should probably do the same and make such a film every 10 years and name it today, which has different actors
 haalanki main ummid kar rahaa hum ki ye alag kahani ho

 "saif also said that he feels that Love is not his tomorrow but Imtiaz Ali's legacy

 The opposition, including the Congress, is trying to corner the Modi government over the action taken by the police on leftist views
 haalanki congress netritv vaale upie-2 sarkaar ke dauraan 128 sanghathanon ko maovadi link ke chalate ection lene ke liye kaha gaya tha
 In such a situation, when five people have been arrested from the same organizations, then Congress President Rahul Gandhi is putting the Modi government in the dock
 rahul ke is kadam ke raajnneetik myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 Is this the political compulsion of the Congress? Sources told India Today that in December 2012, the then UPA-2 government led by the then Manmohan Singh identified 128 organizations with ties to the Maoists
 iske liye manmohan sarkaar ne sabhi rajyon ko in sanghathanon se jude hue logon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani kii baat kahi thi
 The interesting thing is that the leftist thinkers have taken action against the police
 inamen saamaajik kaaryakarta gautam navalkha, varvara raav, sudhaa bharadwaj, arun fereria or varanon gonjalwes shaamil hai
 The names of these five people were also included in the 128 organizations with which the UPA-2 government had linked links with the Maoists
 varavar raav telugu ke prasiddh kavi or revolutionari democratic front ke adhyaksh hai

 upie sarkaar ne apane kaaryalamein jo halafanama daayar kiya tha use saaf kaha tha ki inke maovadiyon se link hai or desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra hai
 Now the same Congress is adopting double standards
 isse saaf ho gaya he ki congress ko aantarik suraksha se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Zafar Islam said that two Congress Prime Ministers have lost their lives
 aise main pradhanmantri kii jaan ko khatre kii baat par rahul gandhi ko ise samarthan karnaa chahie tha, lekin dukhad he ki ve raajnneetik majaburi ke chalate iskaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 He said that today the Congress cannot run without a crutch
 aise main rahul apane vajood ko bachaae rakhane ke liye maovadiyon ke saath sambandh rakhane vaale logon ke saath khadey hai
 Rahul is also aware that the Congress will end completely by losing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isiilie vomaovadiyonka samarthan kar rahe hai
 Lalji Prasad Nirmal, president of UP Scheduled Caste Finance Corporation and Dalit thinker, also believes that the Congress stands with leftist thinkers due to their political interests
 jabaki pradhanmantri kii suraksha ko lekar jo karrwai kii gai he us par kisi tarah kaa koi sawaal nahin khadaa nahin karnaa chahie
 Nirmal said that there is no need to take Rahul Gandhi's words very seriously
 congress kaa suraj dub rahaa he isiilie rahul gandhi or unki party baichaiyn he
 They are talking such things to gain support with the left parties, but in the current era, the left has become a free country
