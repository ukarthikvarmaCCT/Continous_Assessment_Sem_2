 bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ne bihar ke mujffarpur main apane virodhiyon par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the opponents are looking for a solution for Modi
 unhone kaha, 'main desh kii samasyaon kaa hal dhund rahaa hum or virdohi modi kaa hal dhund rahe hai'
 With this, Narendra Modi strongly attacked Nitish Kumar at Hunkar rally
 loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon main jute modi ne bihar main apni duusari raily ko sambodhit karte hue vikaas or aatankwaad ke masale par bihar sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 In the beginning of his speech, Modi also spoke two words in Bhojpuri
 modi ne kaha ki unki patna raily ke dauraan hue bam blast raajnneetik dwesh ke chalate karaae gaye the
 Modi said, 'I came to Patna on 27 October
 meraa bihar ne jis prakaar sammaan kiya
 i consider him my good luck
 lekin usee samay raajnneetik dwesh ke kaaran nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya tha
 One after the other blasts bled the land of Patna
 wo bam dhamaake ke ghaav bharat ke loktantr ke seene par lage the
 On the brotherhood of India, unity and goodwill were engaged
 lekin koi kitni bhi koshish kyon na kar le
 The people of Bihar are determined itane bade hamale ke baad bhi shanti, ekta or bhaichaare ke darshan ne bihar kii janata ne karwaae hai
 i bow to this earth
 'bijepi netaaon ko suraksha na do, magar begunaahon ko mat maromodi ne kaha, 'mere man main vichaar aata he, kisi ko bhaajapa yaa mere khilaaf aitraaj ho saktaa he
 But what kind of faith they have in democracy, they think that it would be good to complete their game in these blasts
 bhaajapa netaaon ko suraksha mili yaa na mili
 Why kill innocent people marane vaale bhi to mere hi bihar ke bhai bahan hai
 But people immersed in vote bank politics cannot understand this pain

 These third-fronters used to appear somewhere a year or six months ago

 congress ke netaa digvijay singh ne ek saath kai morche khol rakhe hai
 In a meeting at Saidnagar in Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, he attacked LK Advani fiercely and held him responsible for bringing terrorism to the country
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki is desh kii ganga-jamuni tahjeeb ko bijepi or adwani ne kharaab kar diya
 He said that Advani first took out the Rath Yatra and got hindu-muslim quarrels in every village
 ab jaise-jaise chunaav aa rahe hai, bijepi ke logon ne phir maahaul kharaab karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Digvijay, on the other hand, was attacked by Samajwadi Party leader Mohammad Azam Khan
 ajam khan ne kaha ki digvijay singh raajnneetik vanvaas par hai
 He does not have any support base in Madhya Pradesh, it is difficult to open the Congress account there and he has brought Tashrif to UP to revive the Congress

 BJP leader and former trust member Bhanu Prakash Reddy said that precious jewelery has disappeared amid tight security

 He raised the demand that TTD should take action against Assistant Executive Officer Srinivasulu

 Speaking to the media in Tirupati, Reddy said that the crowns and gold jewelery donated by the devotees have been missing from the treasury since October 2017

 Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal blamed the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the Kartarpur Corridor Dispute in Pakistan
 unhone enditivi se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki jis samay desh kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha us samay agar nehru chaahate to kartarpur coridor ( Kartarpur Corridor Dispute) ko bharat kii seemaa main rakhane ke liye prayaas kiye ja sakate the
 But they did not do so
 cor ne is dauraan congress party par bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the Congress party has been anti-sikh since the beginning
 jawaharlal nehru ne jahaan kartapur coridor ( Kartarpur Corridor Dispute) ke liye kuch nahin kiya vahiin indira gandhi ne swarna mandir main fouj tak ghusva di
 During the conversation with NDTV, the Union Minister also targeted Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki pakistan sarkaar is coridor ko lekar bhale hi gugali phenkati rahe lekin main yah saaf kar dena chaahati hum ki yah puraa maamla sikhon kii aasthaa se judaa he
 Pakistan may do politics about it, but we just believe that what is happening is due to Guru Nanak Dev Ji
 harsimrat ne is dauraan desh ke kai rajyon main bani congress party kii sarkaar ko lekar bhi tippanee kii
 He said that Congress has lied to farmers and general public
 congress ne kai rajyon main kisaanon se jhuthe vaade kar jeet darj kii he
 He also commented on Priyanka Gandhi
 cor ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi ke aane se congress ko koi phayda nahin hone vaala he
 Significantly, Harsimrat Kaur had earlier given a statement regarding the Kartarpur corridor
 unhone donon desh ke bich shuru ho rahi baatcheet ko lekar enditivi india se khaas baatcheet kii thi
 He said that today the new year starts according to our Sikh calendar
 is nae saal ke mubarak din par donon deshon kii sarkaron ke bich baat ho rahi he
 With the grace of Guru Sahib, after 70 years, they are seeing it transformed into reality and please Guru Sahib, as the corridor is being built here, it should also be made there so that crores of Sikhs like me can be made there by Guru Nanak
 'jab unase poocha gaya ki kya tha ki kartarpur se donon deshon ke rishte sudharenge? to unhone kaha tha ki mujhe puraa bharosa he ki jab 550 saal pehle guru nanak sahab ne is dharti par prakaash kiya tha us samay main vah jagat guru ke rup main ubhar kar aae
 By going to every corner of the country, he worked to connect religions to countries and this is what is needed today
 mana ja rahaa he ki dilli police ne apni closer report main kaha he ki vakil shanti bhushan kii raajnneetik netaaon mulaayam singh yadav or amar singh se kii gai baatcheet sambandhi vivaadit sidi farji nahin, balki vaastavik he
 It is not fake, as is being alleged
 sutron ne bataaya ki jaanchakarta shanti bhushan ke sidi main herpher karne sambandhi aarope kii jaanch karne ke baad jald closer report daayar karenge
 Significantly, in April, a case was registered under Section 469 of the Indian Penal Code (fake work done to damage the reputation)
 sutron ne bataaya ki amar singh ne police ko bataaya ki tepe kii gai aawaaj unki he or isamen ‘kisi prakaar kii chhedchhad’ nahin kii gai he
 The CD was released in the media in April after Anna Hazare fasted for a strong Lokpal
 anshan ke baad bhushan ko lokapal masauda taiyaar karne ke liye banaai gai masauda samiti kaa sashadhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 Bhushan had alleged that this CD has been prepared 'to cut and add somewhere' to discredit civil society
 sidi main bhushan kathith taur par mulaayam singh or amar singh se kehete dikhaae gaye hai ki unka betaa or vakil prashanth bhushan ‘nyaayadhish ko paale main laa’ saktaa he
 Responding to this, Prashant Bhushan said that it appears that some police officers, some forensic agency officials, some government people and others are committing criminal conspiracy
 unhone kaha, ‘‘chandigarh sthit kendriya forencik vigyaan prayogshaala (siefel) ke bare main ve kya bolenge?’’ dilli police ne dilli sthit siefel main forencik jaanch karne ke baad bhushan ke aarope ko galat bataaya tha
 After this, some people had asked him to resign from the Joint Committee set up to draft the Lokpal
 haalanki police ne siefel, chandigarh main kii gai forencik jaanch report ko saarvajanik nahin kiya he
 Bhushan claimed after a forensic examination at Truth Labs, a private lab in Hyderabad, that the CD had been 'tampered'
 swami agnivesh apane vivaadit bayanon ko lekar ekbar phir charchaa main aa gaye hai
 Agniveshneerwind Kejriwal, a former associate of Team Anna, has alleged that he (kejriwal) wished that Anna died during the fast-unto-death at Jantar Mantar
 agnivesh te mutabik aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ko lagata tha ki anna kaa balidaan andolan ke liye acha rahegaa
 Swami Agnivesh made this claim in an interview given to a TV news channel
 agnivesh ke mutabik april 2011 main jab jantar-mantar par jan lokapal andolan shuru hua to vah anna ko aamaran anshan par baitaane ke khilaaf the
 According to Agnivesh, 'when i came to know that Anna was about to go on a fast unto death, i questioned Arvind why he was sitting on fast unto death to an elder like Anna? On this, Arvind said that if he is sacrificed, it will bring revolution
 vah mar jaaenge to koi baat nahin, yah andolan ke liye acha rahegaa
 According to Agnivesh, even after the government approved all the demands during the fast at Jantar Mantar, Arvind Kejriwal continued to provoke Anna to fast for five-seven days
 agnivesh ne kaha, 'andolan kii shuruyaat se hi kejariwal bahut badi mahatvakanksha lekar chal rahe the
 He felt that he could fire his gun only by placing it on Anna's shoulder
 kejariwal ko lagata tha ki anna kii chhavi kaa phayda uthaakar vah logon ke bich apni acchhee chhavi bana sakate hai
 Due to this, he brought Anna from Pune to sit at jantar-mantar
 'agnivesh ke mutabik arvind kejariwal chaahate the ki anna apana andolan jari rakhen
 Despite the government accepting all the demands during the agitation, Anna kept on fasting at the instigation of Arvind
 unhone jab arvind ne baat kii to unhone kaha ki anna anshan nahin todenge abhi paanch-saat din anshan or jari rakhenge
 He felt very bad about this then
 unhen tab laga ki yah anshan kisi or makasad se karavaaya ja rahaa he
 According to Agnivesh, Kiran Bedi also felt bad about this
 swami agnivesh ne kaha ki unhone iske baad team anna ke sadsy shanti bhushan or prashanth bhushan se baat kii
 He too was convinced that now Anna should break the fast
 unhone anna ko jab is bare main samajhaayaa to vah nahin maane
 Shanti Bhushan lashed out at Anna on this
 press conference kar pole-pattee kholane kii dhamkee ke baad hi anna anshan todane par raji hue the
 Team India was highly praised after winning the series 3–0 from South Africa
 nagpur main terning trek par mehmaan team ke ballebaaj spinneron ke saamne bebas dikhe
 The pitch was severely criticized and the match referee described the pitch as bad
 is dauraan team ke captain viraat kohli or team diarector ravi shastri ne pich ko lekar uthe bavaal par bebaaki se jawaab die
 About a week after the series was over, Shastri, speaking to the BCCI website, admitted his team's weaknesses
 shastri ne kaha ki unke ballebaajon ko bhi terning trek par ballebaaji seekhni hogi
 Shastri said, 'our players do not play domestic cricket but it is not their fault
 puraa calendar cricket se bharaa padaa he
 The players do not have footwork, which makes them unable to play spin bowlers on the turning track and needs to be improved a lot
 ' During the entire series, the Director of Team India spoke openly on the captaincy of Virat Kohli many times, but kept the mouths closed on the shortcomings of the batsmen
 ab shastri ne kamiyon ko sweekaar karte hue kaha, 'team ke khilaadiyon ne pichley do saalon main videshon main cricket khelaa, lekin jab wo desh waapas laute to yahi pich unhen videshi lagane lagi, jabaki isi pich par wo khelkar bade hue hai
 However, Shastri also said that Virat and company had a lot to learn from this
 tippaniyan Shastri praised Ajinkya Rahane for scoring two centuries in two innings of the Kotla Test
 unhone kaha, 'rahane pehle test main ek baar bachaav karte hue or ek baar atekking shot khelte hue out hue, lekin kotla kii pari main rahane ke man main saaf tha ki kis shot ko rokna he yaa phir kis par atake karnaa he
 ' shastri ko team india ke ballebaajon kii kamajori ko sweekaar karte hue der jarur lagi he, lekin yahaan yaheen kaha ja saktaa he ki der aae durust aae
 By the way, the batsmen of Team India will have to get into the habit of playing on the turning track soon because for the coming one year, Team India is going to play most of the Test series on its own land
 siries khatm hone ke kareeb ek hafte baad shastri ne bisisiai website se baat karte hue apni team kii kamajoriyon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shastri said that his batsmen also have to learn to bat on the turning track
 shastri ne kaha, 'hamaare khilaadi gharelu cricket nahin khelte lekin ye unki galati nahin he
 The entire calendar is replete with cricket
 khilaadiyon ke paas footwork nahin he, jisase wo terning trek par spin gendbaajon ko nahin khel pate hai or isamen kaaphi sudhaar kii jarurat he
 ' puri siries ke dauraan team india ke diarector ne viraat kohli kii captaini par kai baar khulkar baat kii, lekin ballebaajon kii kamiyon par munh par taale laga liye
 Now Shastri accepted the shortcomings and said, 'the players of the team played cricket abroad in the last two years, but when they returned to the country, the same pitch started to look foreign to them, while they grew up playing on the same pitch
 ' haalanki shastri ne ye bhi kaha ki isse viraat and company ko kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila he
 The comments kotla test kii do pariyon main do shatak lagane vaale ajinkya rahane kii shastri ne khub tarif kii
 He said, "rahane was out defending once in the first Test and playing an attacking shot once, but in the Kotla innings, Rahane was clear on which shot to stop or what to attack
 ' Shastri has taken a while acknowledging the weakness of Team India's batsmen, but here it can be said that it was better to come late
 vaise team india ke ballebaajon ko terning trek par khilne kii aadat jald daalani hogi kyonki aane vaale kareeb ek saal tak team india zyaadaatar test siries apni jameen par khilne vaali he
 During the entire series, the Director of Team India spoke openly on the captaincy of Virat Kohli many times, but kept the mouths closed on the shortcomings of the batsmen
 ab shastri ne kamiyon ko sweekaar karte hue kaha, 'team ke khilaadiyon ne pichley do saalon main videshon main cricket khelaa, lekin jab wo desh waapas laute to yahi pich unhen videshi lagane lagi, jabaki isi pich par wo khelkar bade hue hai

 The tour of New Zealand has been very disappointing for Team India so far
 team vanade siries to ganvaa hi chuki he or 2 maichon kii test siries main bhi 0-1 se pichad rahi he
 This will be the last chance for Dhoni's men to end this drought of defeat
 donon tiimon ke bich doosraa or aakhri test match shuukravaar se shuru hona he
 India lost by 40 runs in the first Test
 isse pehle paanch maichon kii vanade siries dhoni and company ne 0-4 se ganvaai thi
 Team India would like to save their reputation by winning the last Test on b Basin Reserve
 vanade team mejabaan gendbaajon ke short gendon ke akraman ko nahin jhel sake
 The series was considered important for the preparations for the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, but India has so far lost the taste of victory
 pehla test bhale hi chaar din main khatm ho gaya lekin usamen bharat kaa pradarshan vanade siries jaisaa bekaar nahin tha
 Both teams struggled in their behalf
 abhi tak baari pade hai kiwi
 
 
 New Zealand could not bat well in the second innings but their bowlers performed well in both innings
 bharat pehali pari main balle or gend donon se kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran haara
 While the BCCI is trying to make India the pivot of world cricket, it is bizarre to see the Indian team kneeling on foreign soil with such ease
 isse thik pehle dakshin africa main bhi team india kaa yahi haal hua tha
 Beginning of new era after Sachin
 
 
 vaise sachin tendulkar ke sanyas ke baad bhartiya cricket ke nae yug kii shuruyaat kar rahi team ne dakshin africa main sangharsh kiya siries main use dasven or aakhri din paraajay kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 In the foreign situation, there is a red Kukabura ball and havoc and in such a situation the Indian batsmen should have played well
 durban main ve duusari pari main aisa nahin kar sake or siries ganvaa di
 Continuing that mistake on Eden Park, the team were all out for 202 and lost the Test
 viraat-pujaara par badi jimmedaari
 
 
 In the second innings, no one could walk except Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli
 dakshin africa main bhi team kohli or cheteshwar pujaara par nirbhar thi lekin oakland main pujaara kaa nahin chal paanaa team par baari padaa, ab isse bachanaa hoga
 After the defeat in Auckland, Dhoni expressed his desire to get a green pitch in public
 pich curator brett sipathorp ne unki yah khwaahish puri kar di he
 He also made a green pitch for the Test against the West Indies in December

 They were also asked to reduce water supply
 '' lekin un logon kii andekhi ke kaaran yah tabaahi hui
 But Awadh Naresh Gupta, chief engineer of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Irrigation, says, "it came to light due to the machine trip of the Uttarakhand power project, but Uttarakhand did not take security measures
" unhen turant bijli pariyojna ke get band kar dene chahie the
 "in this way, the officials of both the states are trying to save their lives by blaming each other for this accident, but the real question remains that when will the assets of Uttarakhand come under its purview?" Yashpal Arya, Irrigation Minister of Uttarakhand It is accepted that 13,813 hectares of land of Uttarakhand, which belongs to the Irrigation Department, is occupied by Uttar Pradesh
 is bhoomi kii laagat 4,200 karod ru
 Has been judged iske alaava nanaksagar, bagul, dhaura, bor samet chah baandh aise hai, jo uttar pradesh ke adheen hai
 These dams cost Rs 4,000 crore

 Uttar Pradesh is also earning most of these earnings

 It is not in the hands of the state to shut down or leave water
 yashpal arya kehete hai, ''supreme court ne donon rajyon ke bich parisampattiyon ke hastantaran ke liye bharat sarkaar ko aadesh diya he
 But the decision of the Union Water Resources Ministry on convening a meeting between the two states in this regard has not been implemented
 '' kendriya jal sansaadhan mantralay kii donon rajyon ke bich bulaai gai baithak main pratham charan main haridwar kii 28 or udhamsingh nagar kii 13 naharon ko uttarakhand ko or uttarakhand kii 8 naharon ko uttar pradesh ko hastantarit karne par sahmati ban chuki thi
 Yet due to the attitude of Uttar Pradesh, this process could not be completed

 N
 babulkar ne uttarakhand hycourt main janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 According to Babulkar, the High Court had given a brilliant verdict in the interest of Uttarakhand in this regard, but even before the implementation of this decision, the Uttar Pradesh government moved the case to the Supreme Court and took a stay
 babulkar maanate hai ki sarkari susti ke chalate parisampattiyaan ab tak adhar main lataki hui hai
 Despite the Supreme Court's order to maintain the status quo, the Uttar Pradesh government is getting Ganganhar widened in Mayapur, Haridwar
 is chaudeekaran ke jariye 3,000 kusek atirikt pani uttar pradesh ke liye le jaaya ja sakegaa, jabaki haridwar kii teen sinchai yojanaayen pani ke abhaav main lataki hai
 This is enough to show a mirror to state officials
 aisa nahin he ki parisampattiyon ko waapas lene kii koshish nahin hui
 In 2010, Uttarakhand attempted to take back irrigation estates controlled by Uttar Pradesh in Roorkee
 lekin tatkaaleen mayawati sarkaar ke adhikari supreme court chale gaye
 The court had asked the Ganga Management Board to settle the case along with instructions to maintain the status quo
 lekin chaar saal bitne or uttar pradesh or uttarakhand ke apane-apane pradesh sambandhi draft pesh karne ke baavjood ab tak nistaaran nahin ho paaya he
 (bhimgoda Barrage located in Haridwar is under UP Irrigation Department) The state's Nanakasagar Dam, Dhaura Reservoir, Banbasa Dam, Bhimgoda, Ramganga Dam located in Kalagarh, which is the largest earthen dam in Asia, are also occupied by Uttar Pradesh
 yahi nahin, uttar pradesh haripur jalashay, bor jalashay or tumdibia dam kaa anand bhi uthaa rahaa he
 Calling Khatima MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami as a failure of the government machinery so far, there has been no division of assets between the two states, "I had raised the matter in the assembly as well, but nothing has happened so far
" '' rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or udhamsingh nagar se bijepi saansad bhagat singh koshyari kehete hai, ''rajya banane ke 14 saal baad bhi is tarah kaa vivaad durbhagyapurna he
 "koshiyari says to resolve the matter quickly," Uttar Pradesh needs water, which it will get, but the land cannot belong to them
 jameen or bhawan samet infrastracchar uttarakhand ko milane chahie
 The regional political party Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) has warned that party workers will forcibly capture the assets of Uttar Pradesh-occupied Uttarakhand if the asset dispute is not resolved soon
 eukedy netaa kaashi singh airi kehete hai, ''sarkaron kii hilaahvaali se uttarakhand kii janata ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 "this time's accident is a warning to the government
" lekin uttar pradesh ke aditol rukh ke chalate rajya ke liye ab bhi apni hi jameen par vaazib haq hasil karne kii yah raah aasaan nahin lagati

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)april 18, 2018 In the last three to four months, the Punjab government has made a series of big decisions to woo people
 sitambar maheene main mantrimandal kii teesri baithak hone ja rahi he
 Now the cabinet meeting has been convened again on September 26 under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, already two meetings of the cabinet have taken place in the same month
 is baithak main rajya sarkaar ke theke par kaam kar rahe punjab ke kareeb ek lakh karmchaariyon ko niyamit karne kaa faisla kiya ja saktaa he
 But the question is that the Punjab government, already struggling with a huge economic deficit, will regularize these employees for vote bank, but from where will billions of rupees come to pay these employees as salary
 punjab sarkaar kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne pehle hi vibhinn vibhaagon main karmchaariyon ko niyamit karne ke liye ek cameti kaa gathan kiya he, jo ki vibhinn vibhaagon kii taraf se bheje gaye prastaavon par vichaar vimarsh kar rahi he
 Lists of employees working on contracts are being sent by various departments
 akele anganbari karmchaariyon kii sankhya 40 hajaar he
 Apart from this, there are 14 thousand teachers related to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and 1200 staff of non-teaching, the rest is related to other departments
 agar sarkaar theke ke karmchaariyon ko niyamit karti he to yah sankhya ek lakh ke kareeb pahunch jaaegi
 But the Punjab government may decide to regulate the workforce on a large scale due to the assembly elections
 mantrimandal anya vibhaagon main bhi bhartee ko manjuuri de saktaa he, sarkaar ne ek lakh 20 hajaar bhartee kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya tha lekin abhi tak bees hajaar ke kareeb hi bhartee prakriya chal rahi he, isliye sarkaar or vibhaagon main bhi rikt pad bhar sakati he
 Sources say that the government is recruiting so that whichever government comes after the election will see how to pay them
 vahiin punjab main vidhaan sabha chunaavon main prachaar jor shor se shuru ho gaya he congress ne 'congress lao punjab bachaao' campagne ke tahat chandigarh se 13 hitech bason ko puure punjab main prachaar ke liye ravaanaa kiya he jo punjab ke 13 loksabhaa kshetron ko puure 27 din tak cover karengi saath hi in bason ke andar 40 senior netaa bhi rahenge jo puure punjab main apane apane halkon main logon se nukkad baithkon ke madhyam se rubaru honge

 khaskar hamaare adivasee kshetron main jahaan bachche hockey stick se chalanaa sikhte hai, isiilie odisha ne bharat kii sarvshereshth hockey pratibhaaen pesh kii hai
 This is the first time that a state government will not only promote a game within its own border but will help and mentor the Indian hockey team
 yah desh ko odisha kaa uphaar he
 The redesigned logo for the Indian hockey team's jersey is a combination of Odisha
 iske bich main konark wheel he jo pragati or shashaktikaran kaa pratik he, iske alaava yah ugte surya or mashhoor tat kaa rajya he jo sadiyon se vyapaar maarg rahaa he

 Highly placed sources said that Narayanan (75) could be made the governor of a major state
 unako pashchim bengal kaa rajyapal banane kii sambhaavna zyada he jahaan se haal hi main gopal krishna gandhi ne apana kaarykaal puraa kiya he
 Ahead of the Congress core group meeting, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a separate meeting and are understood to have discussed the appointment of governors of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh
 janvari 2005 main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banane vaale narayanan agar rajyapal banate hai to purv videsh sachiv shyaam saran or shivashankar menon ko rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banaaya ja saktaa he
 The post of National Security Advisor was created in the year 1998 during the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Brajesh Mishra was the first to hold this post
 narayanan ke alaava purv grahamantri shivaraj patil, purv maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ajarun singh, congress netaa mohasina kidawai or purv kendriya mantri santosh mohan dev bhi rajyapal pad ke sambhaviton main hai

 All three still remain in their positions as their successors have not yet been announced
 rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kaa samay nahin milane par pareshaan anna hajaare ke gaanv ke sarampach or unke saathiyon ne ghar laut jane kaa faisla kiya or kaha ki yadi unhen ab mulaakaat kaa samay mil bhi gaya to gaanv is baat kaa faisla karegaa ki congress netaa se milanaa he yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, Congress leader PT Thomas, who interacted with these people and allegedly scheduled the meeting, apologized for this 'communication gap', which led to confusion
 hajaare ke nikat sahyogi suresh pathaare ne kaha, ‘ham yahaan tab aaye the jab hamen yah bataaya gaya ki hamaari rahul gandhi ke saath 18 oktober ko subah nau baje mulaakaat he
 We came here believing the words of the MP
 ab saansad kah rahe hai ki yah ek samvadaheenata he
 We are going home ’unhone kaha, ‘hamane saansad ke suzav ke aadhaar par apane patr main rahul gandhi se mulaakaat ke liye likhaa tha
 We have been contacted by Thomas's office several times
 yahaan tak ki rahul gandhi ke karyaalay ne bhi sarpanch ko kai baar phone kiya tha
 ' samay ke saath jaise-jaise jeevanstyli main badlaav aayaa he, takanic hamaari jarurat ban gai he
 There was a time when the camera used to work only during any event or event, but it seems that now this technology has made a special place in our daily life
 yun to aaj har smartphone yaa ek badhiya feechar phone main digital camere kaa hona aam he
 But with time the desire to capture photography or to say that moments of life have increased in pictures
 phone se itar gajats store main in dinon digital camere kii bikri main bhi khub ijapha hua he
 But in such a situation, the most important thing is to know which camera to take and what to keep in mind while buying the camera
 1) khud se puuchhen ye aath sawaal- aapako camera kyon chahie?- camere se aap kis tarah kii photography karnaa chaahate hai? (potrates, landscape yaa sports)- aap adhiktar kisi paristhiti main photography karenge? (indoor, outdoor, lo lite, brit lite)- aap auto mod main photography karenge yaa photography kii kala ko siikhnaa chahenge?- camere ke bare main aapaki jaankaree kitni he, kya aap minial photography karnaa pasand karte hai?- camere main aap kis tarah ke fitures dhundh rahe hai? (juum, image stabeligeshan, fansy yaa badi screen vaala)- camere kaa sies or vajan aapke liye kitna mahatvapurn he?- aapkaa bajet kya he?ye sawaal isliye ki yah bahut had tak tay karte hai kiapaka camerakaisa hona chahie
 Normally the salesman in the showroom also asks you the same question
 bahut sambhav he ki aapke javaabon ko vah apane laabh ke hisaab se istemaal kar aapako vah product thama de, jisaki sahi myne main aapako jarurat he hi nahin
 2) Abandon the temptation of megapixels, usually the one thing that is most discussed when selling the camera is megapixels
 in dinon adhiktar digital camere kam se kam 5 megapixl ke aate hai
 How many megapixels the camera is depends on your need
 is ore koi nirnay karne se pehle yah tay karen ki kya aap khinchi gai tasveeron ko print karavaaenge? agar haa, to uskaa sies kya hoga
 Because a 4 or more megapixel camera is sufficient for printing in normal size
 ise kuch is tarah samajhie ki megapixl sidhe taur tay karata he ki aapaki tasviir bina pixlate hue kitni badi kii ja sakati hai
 Whereas one disadvantage of more megapixels is that every picture will take more space in your memory card as the megapixel increases
 3) essessories: saath main kya-kuch milegacamera kharidte vakt uske fitures ke saath hi yah bhi jaanch len ki extra main kya kuch milane vaala he
 Things you need are - camera case, memory card, spare battery, charger, lens (if DSLR camera), filters, tripod, monopod, external flash, reflectors, etc
 asal main ye wo chijen hai, jinaki jarurat der-saver aapako padati he
 So decide a better deal
 4) duusare ophers search karengar camere ke saath essessories kam mil rahe hai to duusare dils kii talash karen
 Many such offers are also available in online and retail markets
 5) DSLR yaa compact point and shutein dinon DSLR camera jarurat se adhik states simbel bhi ban gaya he
 But it may not necessarily be of your use
 ise kuch is tarah samajhen ki agar aap auto mod main saamaanya photography karnaa chaahate hai to yah aapke liye zyada upyogi nahin he
 It is also overweight and expensive
 isaki saaf-safai or rakrakhaav kii prakriya bhi jatil he
 But if you want to learn the art of photography
 auto mod kii bajaay minial photography aapako aakarshith karti he to delaar camera aapke liye sahi he
 7) Select optical zoom: There are two types of zoom in cameras
 ek digital or doosraa optical
 It would be better to choose optical zoom camera
 digital juum vaala camera sirf aapke shot ke picksal ko badhaata he
 This makes you see the subject bigger
 lekin isse tasviir pixlate ho jaati he
 Keep in mind that your camera is at least 3x optical zoom
 iskaa arth hua ki yah aapke subject ko teen guna bada kar degaa
 7) Read the review: Do a little homework before buying the camera
 apni jaruraton or bajet ke hisaab se camere kaa model chun len
 Then read the review published online or in the magazine
 agar online kharid rahe hai to customer rivyuu bhi padhein
 8) If you are buying a camera from the First Hand Experience Show Room, then take the camera in your hand and check it properly
 yani camera aapke haathon main feet baith rahaa he yaa nahin
 Whether you feel comfortable with him or not
 ek-do tasviir khinch kar dekh len
 Check all options and features
 9) mol bhavaek graahak hone ke naate mol-bhav aapkaa janmasiddh adhikaar he
 You must use this right
 online price compair karen tabhi khariden
 If you are buying from the retail market then buy the product only after collecting the information of discount offer on many stores
 DSLR or compact camere (point and shoot) main se aapke liye koun sa behatar he, isaki charchaa agle lekh main

 "organic Harvest research and development expert Dharma Rajput said that use sunscreen containing chiolin clay and aloe vera for your skin care which gives you 24 / 7 protection by removing dirt from the skin
 unhone yah bhi kaha, "yuvie or yuvibi kirnon se twachaa kii suraksha ke liye ek phul teble spoon organic sanscreen kaa upyog karen or ghar main rahane ke dauraan bhi har do yaa teen ghante main chehre ko saaf kar ise dobaaraa se applai karen

 upi ke greater noida se ek behad chaunkaane vaala maamla saamne aayaa he

 The woman's son studies in seventh grade

 There he saw his son tied with a rope
 aarope he ki jab bachche kii maa vahaan pahunchi to us mahila ne use bhi dhamkaaya or kaha ki agar ye baat kisi ko bataaya to wo use bhi dekh legi

 is seshan main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar se punya prasoon bajpeyi ne baatcheet kii
 Here are the highlights of the conversation
 
 
 1
 Education is not a political agenda, it is a national agenda
 shiksha par ham raajnneeti nahin karte hai
 2
 sirf vishay kaa gyaan shiksha nahin he
 The real education is to keep the passion of education alive
 3
 After Right to Education, about 98% children have reached school
 ab ajukeshan main quality kii jarurat he
 4
 primary ajukeshan main innovations yani jigyaasa ko badhaava dena hoga
 Children's creative mind should not be suppressed, their curiosity should be encouraged
 5
 The Modi government is seriously considering the problem of brain drain
 ham 20 world class uniwarsities banaaenge
 6
 ucch shiksha par paune do lakh karod rupee pichley saal kharch kiye or ise aane vaale samay main badhaayaa jayega
 7
 dimd uniwarsities yaa privet uniwarsities main se ucch gunvattta vaale sansthaanon ko puri swaittata kii di jaaegi
 8
 har student ko aathvin tak kya aana chahie, yah teacher kii jimmedaari hogi
 Such a rule will apply
 9
 Education policy reform is necessary every 20 years
 shiksha vyavastha ko mishan mod main sudhaarenge
 10
 sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas, sabko acchhee shiksha hamaari sarkaar kaa lakshya
 11
 bhashaa ko lekar koi jabardastee nahin
 All languages should be respected
 12
 What punishment should be given to those who burn schools in Kashmir, it should be an issue of debate in the media
 13
 If 50 years of black money can be removed, then 50 days will be a little painful
 14
 Project work is given in schools, which are done by parents, not children
 ise badalanaa hoga
 15

 com / wrbgjcakrn — ANI (@ani_news) July 25, 2015 bharat ne isisi cricket world cap 2019 ke match main westeindies ko 125 ranon se haraakar toornament main chhathi jeet darj kii he
 India have come second in the table of 10 teams with 11 points
 newjiland ke bhi 11 ank hai lekin behatar ran rate ke kaaran bharat aage he
 So far in the World Cup 2019, India has dusted off South Africa, Australia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and West Indies
 toornament main bharat kaa safar to ab tak shandaar rahaa he, lekin anbhavi ballebaaj emes dhoni kii ek kamajori aane vaale bade muqablon main team ke liye musiibat ban sakati he
 Question on MS Dhoni's batting Mahendra Singh Dhoni's biggest weakness so far has been to rotate strikes less and play dot ball more
 westeindies ke khilaaf world cap match main mahendra singh dhoni ne 61 gendon par 56 ranon kii pari kheli
 Dhoni hit only 3 fours and 2 sixes during his innings
 dhoni kii is pari ke dauraan sabase dilachasp baat yah rahi ki dhoni ne apni 56 ranon kii pari ke dauraan pehle 26 ran 45 gendon par banaae
 During this time his strike rate was 57
 78 kaa tha
 Dhoni scored the next 30 runs off 16 balls
 tab unka strike rate 187
 It was 50
 half pich tak pahunche dhoni ko stump nahin kar paaya indies kaa wicketkipardhoni kii is kamajori ke kaaran bharat kii pari dhimi pad jaati he
 In the last two matches, India's innings has slowed down especially after 30 overs
 jisase bharat 300 ke score tak nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 Dhoni's batting against Afghanistan and the West Indies has been very simple
 dhimi batting se hoga ye nuksansemifinal or final jaise muqablon main dhoni kii isi kamajori ke kaaran agar bharat bada score nahin bana paaegaa to team ko bada khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Earlier, in the World Cup match against Afghanistan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni disappointed the fans by playing innings of 28 runs off 52 balls
 tab sachin ne dhoni kii ballebaaji par naaraazgi jataai thi
 Former Indian batsman VVS Laxman made a big statement about Dhoni
 vivies lakshmana ne kaha ki dhoni ko apni is approach par kaam karnaa hoga
 Laxman said, "dhoni's strike rate at the beginning of the innings was between 45-50
 isse team par or unke saath ballebaaji kar rahe khilaadi par pressure banataa he
 It is okay that you finish Finnish in good style but initially he (dhoni) could play with positive intent especially against spinners like Fabian Allen
 'lakshmana ne aage kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki jis tarah se emes dhoni apni pari kii shuruyaat karte hai kisi na kisi din us par unhen pachhtaawaa hoga
 This is the area that Dhoni needs to work on
 afghanistan ke khilaaf pichley match main bhi, dhoni ke liye strike rotate karnaa mushkil tha
 It is all good when the fast bowlers are bowling
 unhone hardik pandya ke vipareet shuruyaat main sakaaratmak iraadaa nahin dikhaaya

 Naxalites carried out the incident on Sunday morning in Thutangi village of Dumbriguda division, 125 km from Visakhapatnam
 ye jagah odisha kii seemaa se lagati he
 After these two high-profile killings, the question has arisen as to whether Naxalism has come back alive in Andhra Pradesh
 It is noteworthy that Andhra Pradesh has been saved from the events of the past several years but the incident of Sunday forced the administration to think
 Naxalism has been wiped out from Andhra soil? Reddy government crushed Naxalism in Andhra Pradesh then Rajasekhara Reddy's government Had big action against the rebels
 is karrwai se reddy ke netritv kii sarkaar nencsli hinsakuchalane main kaamyaab rahi
 Subsequent governments also strictly followed Reddy's strategy, with results
 reddy sarkaar ne naksalwad ke safaaye ke liye grey hound naamak aadhunik hathiyaaron or training se las suraksha bal banaaya tha
 The Naxalites were found and eliminated by these security forces
 nateeja yah rahaa ki centre sarkaar maowad prabhavit rajyon ko salaah detii dekhi ja sakati he ki ve naksaliyon se nipatane ke liye andhrapradesh kaa model apanaaen
 History of Maoist organization In 1980 Maoist organization named People's War Group was formed
 us salmaowadi hinsaki 38 ghatnaayen saamne ain jinamein chah hatyaein bhi thim
 In 1991, the highest number of Maoist violence was reported at 953
 inamen 178 aam log or 49 pulicekarmi maare gaye
 Then 21 out of 23 districts of Andhra were prone to Maoist violence
 varshavaar mauton kaa aankada dekhen to 1990 main 145, 1991 main 227, 1992 main 212 or 1993 main 143 mautein darj kii gayi
 Chandrababu Naidu's strictness Like Rajashekhar Reddy, the Chandrababu Naidu government also came out strongly against the Maoists
 baukhalaaye maovadiyon ne ek baar naidu kii hatya karne kii bhi koshish kii lekin naidu ne sakhti baratane ke alaava baatcheet kaa rasta bhi kholaa
 The result was that a strategy against Naxalites on the one hand and the strategy of bringing it into mainstream politics on the other hand was successful in reducing the Naxalite attacks
 grehound abhiyaan or naksalwadaganpati, koteshwar raav yaa sudarshan-ye aise naam hai jinaki naksali abhiyaanon main tuuti bolti thi
 These Naxalite leaders belonged to Andhra Pradesh but Greyhound security forces eliminated these leaders

 However, their activities continue from these states

 ambika soni may 2009 se soochna or prasaaran mantri hai, yahi vah avadhi he jisamen sanyogvash upie-2 ke liye pareshaaniyon kaa daur shuru hua he
 She is coping with adversity, pressuring the media for a group of ministers since Anna Hazare's fast in April, and she has also stood up against the call to control news channels
 7 aktubar ko, jahaan cabinet ke tivi channelon par prastaavon ne hangaamaa machaa diya tha, unhone kaha ki ''aalochana sirf media gharaanon se ho rahi he, jinke channel hai
 Excerpts from the conversation with Editor Kaveri Bamzai: Why did i feel the need to amend the guidelines? When i took office in 2009, i was asked to approve 55 channels a day and 32 channels three weeks later
 maine koi paanvaale kii dukaan nahin kholi thi
 i wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, as well as some complaints in which real estate people were using their channels to bully them
 isliye hamane shuddh sampatti badhaane kaa faisla kiya or sheersh prabandhan main ek sadsy ko media kaa anubhav hone sambandhi maandand ko lekar aae
 In addition, licenses are coming up for renewal
 ab cabinet ne hamen un channelon ke license naveekaran kii ijaajat de di he, jinhone kaarykram or vigyaapan samhita kaa paanch yaa usase adhik baar ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Who will decide what the violation is? This will be determined after consultation with the established self-control mechanism

 kya yahaan kaa kanoon un par lagu nahin hota?kya media par niyantran ko lekar aap party ke dabaav main hai?log aarope laga rahe hai ki soochna or prasaaran mantralay nazarandaaj kar rahaa he
 i have told the news channels, see for yourself how you are defaming people
 aatmaniyantran sarvshereshth he lekin ise mahaj do shabd hi na rahane den
 i feel that UPA is open minded
 upie kii adhyaksh khule vichaaron vaali hai, aise hi pradhanmantri bhi hai
 There are also strong advocates of control in the Congress? You can react for a moment when you become eligible for a lot of attacks
 ek netaa hone ke naate hamaare paas apane bare main kuch vichaar ho sakate hai jinase duusare sahamat nahin ho sakate
 i changi self control system to be implemented
 agar meraa netritv samajhta he ki main nishhibhavi hum, to mujhe mantralay chhodane main koi aapatti nahin he
 At what time were you under extreme pressure to control the media? Anna Hazare Part-1 or Part-2? Part-2
 mujhse kaha gaya ki media ke kaaran ham haar rahe hai
 But someone realizes that i only have some control over Doordarshan
 baaki kaa media meri property nahin he
 Why would they fear me or anyone else? i think the media also got carried away in this row
 mujhe lagata he ki khaskar hindi channel kaaphi aakraamak or vyapak pahunch vaale hai

 beijing main chal rahe van belt van road summit main bharat kii gaiyr maujuudagi china ko jamkar khali
 This is the reason why India's absence at the One Belt One Road Summit remained a matter of discussion
 chini media ne is summit main bharat ke hissaa nahin lene kii khabar ko pramukhataa se prakashit kiya
 Chinese newspaper Global Times said that India did not participate in the summit due to the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) being built under the One Belt One Road project
 vahiin, chini raashtrapati ne bina naam liye bharat kii chintaaon par kaha ki sabhi deshon ko ek-duusare kisamprabhutaa kaa sammankarna chahie
 In fact, India is strongly opposed to CPEC passing through Gilgit of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok)
 gilgit, hunja, scardu or ghijar ke logon ne CPEC ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan tej kar diya he
 While on one hand Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif was praising CPEC in Beijing, on the other hand people were protesting against it in Gilgit, Hunza, Skardu and Ghijar
 pradarshnakariyon kaa kahana tha ki china pakistan kii madad se gilgit par kabja kar rahaa he
 China is building its military base to deal with the US, while exploiting Gilgit's resources
 iske alaava is summit main pakistani piem ke saath gilgit-blatistan ke mukhyamantri ke nahin jane par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Locals say that Nawaz Sharif took with him the chief ministers of four provinces, but why did he not take any leader of gilgit-baltistan
 iske atirikt baloch kaaryakarta bhi china ke CPEC ke virodh main hai
 Even after staying away from the Kashmir issue, India did not come fully aware that without including India, it cannot succeed in carrying out its project
 yahi vajah rahi ki van belt van road summit main bharat kii gaiyr maujuudagi charchaa kaa vishay rahi
 The Chinese newspaper Global Times said that China has said many times that India's involvement in the One Belt One Road project will not affect the Kashmir issue
 vah isamen katai dakhal nahin degaa, lekin bharat phir bhi is summit main hissaa nahin le rahaa he
 However, the Chinese newspaper also said that despite India's distance, the project would not be affected
 china kii manshaa par sandeshchin kaa kahana he ki van belt van road pariyojna 65 deshon ko jodygi, jisase aarthik sthirataa or vikaas ko badhaava milegaa
 At the same time cultural ties between people of these countries will be strengthened
 haalanki is summit se bharat samet in 44 deshon ke rashtradhyakshon ne vyaktigat taur par hissaa lene se kinaaraa kaata
 These countries only sent their diplomats to the summit
 china kii is manshaa par bharat or vietnam hi nahin, balki europea desh bhi andeh jataa rahe hai

 It seems that the bjp's two-year tenure of Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel did not go down well
 vidhansabha chunaav kii aahat pate hi alaakaman ne rajya main khiskate janaadhar ko bachaane ke liye anandiben patel ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane kaa faisla kiya
 Let us know that there can be some specific reasons behind the removal of Anandi Patel from the Chief Minister's post
 1
 The reputation of the Patel movement was spoiled
 2
 In the report of PM Mathur's trusted Om Mathur, it is mentioned that the Patel vote from BJP has been eroded in Gujarat
 3
 New CM can be brought to deal with anti-incumbency
 4
 According to many reports, if the next contested Togujrat in the Anandibenki leadership could go through bjp's hand
 5
 Gujarat has assembly elections next year, so BJP is not in the mood to take any risk
 6
 According to sources, communication between the state government and the BJP organization has also deteriorated earlier
 7
 The increasing interference of both the children of CM in the government is also being considered as a reason

 After assuming office in October 1998, the Pakistan Army's flamboyant and ambitious chief, General Pervez Musharraf, may have considered the operation with this in mind

 He took out a plan that had been gathering dust in Pakistan's General Headquarters for many years, about which Musharraf already had a lot of knowledge because he had once been Director General Military Operations (DGMO)

 An entire Pakistani brigade was standing across the lake and how could we not see them? ”on 11 June, the then Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh released records related to Musharraf's telephonic conversation with his deputy lieutenant general Mohammad Aziz in Rawalpindi

 Air Force fighter jets dropped laser-guided bombs on top of the hill, Indian cannons deployed in the valley fired thousands of rounds of shells that flew off the roofs of 'mujahideen' made conglomerates over the peaks and the soldiers almost climbed uphill to face the enemy And a bloody battle was fought face to face
 is ladaai main sabase pehle us jhooth kaa pardaafash hua ki sena kashmiri aatankwaadiyon se lard rahi thi
 It was clear from the kind of resistance that our soldiers faced when they were climbing hard that the people sitting on the heights could not be Mujahideen
 mujahidin ne kabhi aisi rakshaatmak ladaai nahin ladi thi
 They did not counter-attack, nor did they ever lay landmines

 pi
 Malik says, "the Mujahideen mask of the Pakistani army was successful until mid-june of 1999 because there were no intelligence reports of the army's involvement before the war
" sabhi khufia agenciyaan apni shuruaati report main mujahidin aatanki campon or gulam kashmir main unke jamaavade par dhyaan de rahi thim
 Pakistan's scheme of giving false information (electronic deception plan) was successful
 '' unhone kaha, ''hamaari khufia agenciyaan, yahaan tak ki morche par sainik bhi yahi maan rahe the
 My argument was that the Mujahideen could not stand so long or use the cannon but could not get the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to agree to it
 shaayad yahi kaaran tha ki sisies ne kargil ko 'yuddh' ghoshit nahin kiya or elosi paar karne kii anumati nahin di
 The government agreed when there was strong evidence that the Pakistani army was on hand after the capture of Tololing (13 June)
 vahaan se pakistanisena ke niyamit hathiyaar or upkaran hi nahin mili balki sainikon kii pe book, movement order or signal code book bhi haath lage
 The army had recovered several personal diaries of Pakistani officers
 inamen se ek 5 enelaai ke lecritnent mohammad maaj ullah khan sumbal kii diary bhi thi
 The pocket diary was an honorific copy presented by the ex-servicemen's military foundation, Mari Gas, an energy company
 lahore chhavnee kii raksha awaas socity ke nivasee leftinent ne diary main likhaa he ki 31 janvari ko unki kargil main tainaati kii soochna mili thi
 The date he received this diary was written and the letters and Eid cards from home were also kept in the middle
 is abhiyaan main 'lamas' halke helicopter or ek emi-17 medium-lift helicopter kii madad kii jaankaree bhi thi
 Sumbal kept writing diaries regularly till the middle of June
 bhartiya topakhane se hui golabari main unke baayen haath kii haddi tut gai to unhen vahaan se nikaalkar pakistan ke punjab praant main le jaaya gaya
 The young officer has written the experiences of Kargil in the diary which was left behind
 usne 19,000 foot par mines 22 degree main nahaane ke bhayaavah anubhav or hamjigund main apana 27waan janmdin manaane ke anubhavon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Sumbal has written that on 15 June he met a fellow NLI officer who had caught Indian Air Force pilot flight Lieutenant Nachiketa
 nachiketa jis mig-27 ko uda rahe the uske ek ingine main aag lag gai or vah durghatnagrast hokar batalik main gir gaya tha
 Sumbal has written that on June 30, the 18th day of his deployment in the sector, Indian shelling caused great havoc and the pellets of the Indian Army shells ripped the tent in which they were
 op capi pakistan kaa gupachup tareeke se kargil kii paharipoon ko apane kabje main lene kaa abhiyaan tha par isane apane peeche dastavejon kaa aisa ambara choda jisane uski kalai khol di
 It also contained a large amount of material that both the armies of a common colonial origin were familiar with
 unki gaur se chaanbin kii jaae, to unamem se kai aise suraag milte hai jo najar se chhot gaye
 Take, for example, the handing / taking over paper of Officers Mess Property recovered from the Batalik sector, where 5 NLI was fighting
 batalian ne pakistan kii taraf ke elosi kaa ek base khaali kar diya or batalik main bhartiya seemaa kii taraf badi
 The Indian intelligence system completely failed to detect this action
 baraamad kiye gaye anya dastavejon main se kuch main op capi kii parichaalan sambandhi gopneeyata kii vistrut yojana kaa zikr he
 In May 1999, a secret list of code words used by the Pakistani Army was also recovered by the Indian troops from Kaksar region
 unhone 'dushman pojishan' ke naam ke liye sankhyaayein nirdhaarit kii thim jaise—kargil 713; mashkoh 812 or zojila 101 tha
 On 31 May, an Inter Office Note (ION) sent from 80 Infantry Brigade outlined protocols related to communications security
 elelaai kii units ko keval field telephone kaa istemaal karne ko kaha gaya tha, haai frequency ke radio set nahin
 Military analysts point out that the use of radio sets is avoided because it gives information about their position
 is bich, landline conection dhwast ho gaya or captain ali ul hasanan dwaara hastakshrit inter offis note (ioen) baraamad hua he jisamen unhone units ko haai frequency radio wireles set pike-786 par batalian mukhyalay se sampark karne kii salaah di he
 And finally, among the recovered items were copies of the map of Pakistan showing the LOC as part of Pakistan on August 29, 1972 in New Delhi as per mutually approved drawings
 prayek paksh kii taraf se taiyaar nakshe ke do seton main elosi ko phir se paribhaashit karke pesh kiya gaya tha
 This exposed the initial claims of the Pakistani Army that they carried out their military activities only on their side of the loc
 ve jaanate the ki ve kya kar rahe hai
 And when by 5 July, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the removal of his army from Kargil's Peaks after a meeting with US President Bill Clinton, the Pakistan Army refused to even take the bodies of NLI soldiers
 pakistan fouj ne apvadswarup keval paanch shavon ko sweekaara jisamen 12enelaai ke captain karnal sher bhi the, jo kagil ke gooltary main maare gaye or unhen maranoparant pakistan kaa sarvocch sainya puraskaar nishaan-e-haidar diya gaya

 The documents that were recovered provided sufficient basis for the committee members to believe that Pakistan's campaign was to fail from the beginning
 pehali baat, jin yuva pakistani adhikariyon or sainikon ko bheja gaya, unhen is kshetra kii koi vishesh soochna nahin thi
 Only a limited number of jawans (about 1,700) were deployed in the infiltration within a range of only 100 km from five to 9 km
 yah sankhya kshetra par pakad banaae rakhane ke liye paryaapt nahin kahi ja sakati
 Given the terrain and weather, a large military operation cannot be carried out for long

 ve is ranneeti ko ''1984 ke bharat ke siachin akraman kaa jabaav'' bataate hai or 12 enelaai ke mujahidon ke bich mithai baantne ke liye 8,000 rupye dete hai
 When Musharraf released his memoir In the Line of Fire in 2006, he publicly acknowledged his military role and claimed victory in Kargil
 july 2004 main india today se khaas baatcheet main navaj sharif ne kaha tha, ''kargil main maare gaye sainikon kii taadaad 1965 or 1971 kii jang main maare gaye sainikon kii kul sankhya se bhi zyada thi

 The camp, built on the Juba hill of Balakot, was opened for a tour on 10 April under strict surveillance of the Pakistani Army

 But they were not allowed to go to other parts of the camp where Jaish terrorists and their instructors lived (the Indian Intelligence Department was aware that there was a madrasa adjacent to the camp and that Indian Air Force aircraft were bombed by madrasas Instructions were given to escape)

 "we will stop selling all our diesel cars from April next year
" nae utsarjan maanak lagu hone ke baad dijal kaaren kaaphi mahangi ho jaaengi
 Especially, small cars that 1
 5 litre se chote ingine ke saath aati hai, unki keemten graahakon ke liye mufeed nahin rahengi’’aar
 C
 bhargav,chairman, maaruti sujuki india limiteddesh kii sabase badi car nirmaataa company maaruti kii ore se haal main aae is bayaan ko bharat main choti dijal kaaron ke vidaai sandesh ke taur dekha ja saktaa he
 Maruti has a 50 per cent share in India's car market
 maaruti ke baad tata motors ne bhi apane chuninda dijal modells ko band karne ke sanket die hai
 Mayank Parikh, president (passenger vehicle business unit), Tata Motors, says, "it would not be logical to build a new small engine due to the declining demand for diesel engines in small and entry level cars
 ’’unhone yah bhi spasht kar diya ki bies VI maanakon ko puraa karne main jo bhi laagat aegi, uskaa boj aakhirkaar graahakon par hi padegaa
 Petrol cars account for 80 percent of the company's total sales
 darasal, vaahanon se hone vaale pradooshan par ankush lagane ke liye sarkaar ne 1 april, 2020 se bharat stage VI (bies VI) utsarjan maanakon ko anivaary kar diya he
 That is, the engine installed in a car or motorcycle made on April 1, 2020 will be compliant with BS VI standards, which will reduce the pollution caused by diesel cars by 80 percent
 bies VI maanak antarrashtriya maanak euro VI ke samanaantar he
 The automobile industry is currently following BS IV standards, which is equivalent to Euro IV
 aise main maujuuda ingine ko bies VI maanak ke anuroop banane ke liye technology ko apgrade karne kaa kharch aayega
 This is now a new challenge for the automobile sector, which is facing sluggish demand
 mahangi hongi sabhi karenoto today ke editor yogendra pratap kehete hai, ‘‘bies VI ingine ke saath petrol or dijal sabhi tarah kii kaaren mahangi ho jaaengi
 The difference between the price of petrol and diesel cars has increased to around Rs 2 lakh
 tak hone kii sambhaavna he, jo philhal 1 se 1
 25 lakhs
 ke bich he
 "it will cost less to make the petrol engine conform to the new standards," says Yogendra
 phir bhi in kaaron ke daam main ausatan 50,000 ru
 May increase up to
 vahiin dijal ingine ko bies VI maanak ke hisaab se taiyaar karne main kharch zyada aayega kyonki ve zyada jatil hote hai
 However, the price of the car will depend on different models
 iske alaava sexti maanakon ke paalan kaa dabaav bhi auto sector par he
 In which it will be mandatory to meet the standards like air bags, ABS, crash test ratings etc
 aise main sabhi tarah kii car kaa mahangaa hona tay he
 Small diesel cars will be finished, says Auto Expert Tutu Dhawan, "small diesel cars will be finished after coming to BSK standard
 inaki keemten graahakon ke liye mufeed nahin rahengi
 "that's why companies have not shown much interest in investing on small diesel engines
 dhawan kehete hai, ‘‘1
 Demand for diesel cars in the SUV or utility vehicles segment with 5-liter or larger engines will still remain
 ”giving the example of Fortuner, he says that the vehicle launched today at Rs 17 lakh will cost Rs 34 lakh
 main bikati he tab bhi graahak maujuud hai, to keemat kuch lakh ru
 Increasing demand will not end at all
 esayuvi segment main abhi bhi 83 fisad hissedari dijal gadipoon kii he, jo 2012 main 98 fisadi thi
 However, diesel cars are already losing popularity among customers
 aankadon ke mutabik, saal 2012-13 main car bikri main dijal kii hissedari 47 fisad thi jo 2018-19 main ghatakar 19 fisadi ho gai
 The major reason for this is the low difference between petrol and diesel prices and various restrictions
 rajdhani dilli main petrol kii keemat (08 may) 73 ru
 Per liter, while diesel 66
 66 ru
 Selling per liter
 vahiin, april-may 2012 main petrol kii tulana main dijal prati litre 25 ru
 Was cheap
 dijal kaaron ke liye graahak 1 se 1
 25 lakhs
 zyada dene ko isliye taiyaar hote the kyonki saste eendhan or achche milage ke kaaran unhen chalaanaa sasta padataa tha
 But now things have changed
 disambar, 2015 main supreme court ne dilli main 2000 sisi se zyada ke dijal ingine ke registration par roak laga di thi
 Apart from this, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered the removal of 10-year-old diesel cars from the roads of Delhi NCR
 in adeshon par baad main bhale roak laga di gai ho par pichley varshon main hue is ghatnakram ne graahakon ke man main dijal kaaron ke prati anischitata kaa maahaul bana diya
 Says Yogendra, "to curb pollution, the government has to make similar rules for private and commercial vehicles
 niyam pradooshan ke aadhaar par banane chahie na ki ingine ke sisi ke aadhaar par, nnyonki agar sahi rakrakhaav ho to jaruri nahin ki 10 saal baad bhi dijal car bahut pradooshan kare
 “the atmosphere against diesel cars is not only in India but also in the large passenger vehicle market like European Union
 foxwagon kii herapheri ke khulaase ke baad is bahes ne jor pakadaa he
 Toyota has decided to discontinue its diesel cars in Europe
 porce or volvo ne spasht kiya he ki unke aagaamee modells dijal aadhaarit nahin honge
 There is talk of banning diesel cars in countries like Germany, which is a leader in diesel cars
 dijal nahin to phir kya?dhawan kehete hai ki choti dijal kaaron kii kami ko puraa karne main petrol, sienji yaa electric vaahan kitni bhoomika nibhaayenge, yah sarkaar kii nitiyon par nirbhar karegaa
 Lack of infrastructure is a major challenge
 rajdhani kaa udhaaharan dete hue ve bataate hai ki dilli main sienji aae 20 saal se zyada ho gaye par aaj bhi logon ko ghanton line main laganaa padataa he
 In such a situation, if more vehicles are shifted to CNG then large investment will be required
 electric kaaron kii disha main bhi companiyaan kaam kar rahi hai
 If the government's policies are clear, electric cars can also become an option in the coming years
 socity for indian automobile menuphactures ko ummid he ki 2030 tak bikri main electric whical kii hissedari 40 fisad tak ho sakati he
 After the new changes, the impact on demand is likely
 aise main sarkaar ke saamne chunauti pehle se mand pad rahi auto sector kii raftaar ko sahaara dene kii bhi hogi
 *** loksabhaa saansad kailash joshi kii mangalvaar kii shaam ko bhopal ke bairagarh ilaake main jeb cat gai
 Police said on Wednesday that mps had gone there to buy some utensils when their pockets were suddenly cut
 unhone bataaya ki jeb main 14 hajaar rupye the or jeb us vakt kati jab ve vahaan par hue ek haadase main ghayal yuvak kaa haalchaal poochne ke liye apni gaadi se utre
 The MP has not filed the case report with the police yet
 pradooshan ko rokane ke liye engiti ne 5 rajyon dilli, haryana, punjab, rajasthan or uttar pradesh ke mukhya sachivon kii ek cameti banaai he, jisamen paryaavaran sachiv bhi shaamil honge
 It will be mandatory for the committee to meet once in 2 months
 cameti kaa kaam pradooshan par suzav dene ke alaava sujhaavon ko lagu karaane kii bhi jimmedaari hogi
 The Central Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment have also been included in this committee by the NGT in its action report given by the Delhi government in the NGT hearing on the pollution of Delhi, that the government is strictly enforcing the things which the NGT has banned
 is
 isamen stone krashar, eent bhatte band karnaa, nirmaan kaary ek hafte ke liye rokna shaamil he
 All the mcds of Delhi today told the NGT that their staff is working as per the order of the NGT
 engiti ne kaha ki aap log kagaji karwai me chaahe jo kare lekin hamen jamini haqikat ko badalanaa he
 Why are you not working on it? dilli ke log bahut sahansheel he jo kaam ke is ravaiye ko jhel rahe he, saath hi padosi rajyon ke log bhi is pradooshan ko jhelane ko majaboor he
 The ngt's question on sprinkling water on the road also questioned the decision by the NGT to sprinkle water on the roads and how the pollution can be reduced by clearing the road when there is pollution in the air
 saath hi sivej ke treet kiye gaye pani ko sadak par kaise chhidaka ja saktaa he jahaan log sadak par chal rahe hai
 The Environment Ministry said that work is being done from the challan of old vehicles to the confiscation of them
 engiti ne poocha ki kya aapane ye research kii he ki aapke is prayaason se pradooshan kaa kitna str ghat rahaa he
 State governments will also have to think whether the normal work that governments are doing to prevent pollution is having any effect
 fasal jalane ko lekar punjab se sawalkrop burning ko lekar punjab or haryana se engiti ne poocha ki aapane ye check kiya ki waha ke kisaan happy seader mashin kaa istemaal karne ko taiyaar he
 Punjab said that it is not possible to provide machines to all farmers at the same time
 lekin sarkaar koshish kar rahi he ki mashin kaa istemaal bade or crop burning kisaan na karen
 The NGT said that are you ready to give this machine free to farmers
 iske istemaal par kisaan ko koi bhi rakam dene kaa boj nahin hona chahie
 But Punjab and Haryana could not give some specific response to the NGT on this
 unka kahana he ki sabsidi dekar kisaano ko ye mashin di ja sakati he
 But the NGT said that it should be free of cast
 WHO kii report par upi se maange suzavenjiti ne uttar pradesh se kaha ki WHO ne ek list jari kii he jisame aapke rajya ke kai jile duniya ke sabase pradooshit ilaake hai
 How do you suggest that this can be improved? upi ne kaha ki ham aapke sujhaavon par amal kar rahe he or un logon ke khilaaf ection le rahe he jo pradooshan ke liye jimmedaar he

 Ahluwalia is actually a resident of Bihar and these days Sikhism is camping in Patna in connection with Prakash Utsav organized on the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh

 Ahluwalia said that Nitish has left no stone unturned in organizing the guest devo bhava
 haalanki unki rajya sarkaar ko salaah he ki bihar main sikh circuit ke vikaas par or dhyaan dena chahie kyonki punjab ke baad sabase bada sikh circuit bihar main hi he
 Although Ahluwalia claims that the Center has given financial help to the event as promised, but the state government has its own argument that the state government has not received the amount of 100 crore promised for this particular event
 ahaluwalia ke alaava, dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal bhi somvaar ko patna pahunche the or nitish kumaar se mulaakaat ke pehle guru govind singh kii janm sthali taakh harimandir sahib main maathaa techne ke baad aayojan kii jamkar tarif kii
