 lekin jaise hi bharat ke videsh mantralay ne kaha ki hamaara ek hi payalat laapata he to kuch der baad pakistan apni baat se palata

 jhooth number 2 – 2 nahin ek vimaanpakistan ne daawa kiya tha ki uski seemaa main do bhartiya vimaan aae the, jise usne maar giraaya he
 But India made it clear that only one of their Mig had collapsed

 That is, the plane wreck which Pakistan was showing yesterday was theirs
 jhooth number 3 – hamane F-16 istemaal nahin kiyapakistan ne kal kaha tha ki unhone kisi F16 vimaan kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 But today his picture has come out, whose army is seen picking up the debris
 ye vahi vimaan he jo bharat kii seemaa main ghus rahaa tha lekin vayusena ne use khaded diya tha

 jiske baad pakistani vimaanon ko dum dabaakar bhaagna padaa tha

 He said that following the five-year-old order of the Supreme Court, the Central Government ended the subsidy on Haj pilgrimage and has taken a bold decision to spend a huge amount of Rs 700 crore for the education of Muslim girls
 unhone kaha ki karodon mahilaon ko aage badhane kaa mauka dene vaale is kadam kaa musalamaanon ne bhi swaagat kiya, lekin alpsankhyakon ko vot bank samajhane vaale log virodh karne lage hai
 Sushil Kumar said that Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Prasad should tell whether the training of women is not more important? He said that 84 years ago the British had started subsidizing Muslims on Haj pilgrimage under the devious policy of divisive rule, Congress continued it even after independence
 ise musalamaanon ko laalach dene jaisaa bataakar jab sarvocch nyaayalay ne haj sabsidi khatm karne kaa aadesh diya tab tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne aadesh ko thande baste main daalkar kattarpathiyon kaa saath diya tha

 jab 1965 main pakistan ne bharat ke khilaaf "oparation grand slam" ko anjaam diya or pakistani tinkon ne akhnur shahar par dhaava bol diya
 Arjan Singh then led the Indian Air Force
 aapako bataa den, pakistani hamale kii khabar milte hi jab raksha mantralay ne sabhi sena pramukhon ko talab kiya or kuch minuton kii is mulaakaat main arjan singh se poocha gaya ki vah kitni jaldi pakistan ke badhate tinkon ko rokane ke liye air force kaa hamalaa kar sakate hai

 There was tight security outside the airport
 pavitra amarnath jane vaale yatriyonke vaahanon main is baar ek khaas tarah kii radio frequency aidantification, jise rfidi tag kehete hai, lagaaya ja rahaa tha
 This tag was also installed in our taxi, so that it can be known that the vehicle is of Amarnath Yatra, and the location of the car can also be found from the bar code reader installed at the place
 taxi driver imran ne baatcheet main apana naam imran bataaya
 When asked what the atmosphere is like, he said- 'sir, this is good, this is what the outside media is saying, it is speaking wrong
 aap khud yahaan rahakar dekho
 After this we reached the Kashmir Frontier BSF Camp

 Every 100 meters there was a jawan, armored carriages and walking squad
 sandesh saaf diya gaya he ki is baar tirthayatra par koi aatanki hamalaan hone paae
 On the way from Srinagar to Sonmarg, there was no problem on the way due to clear weather
 taxi driver imran ne bataaya ki 'yahaan chah maah garmi or chah maah sardi hoti he
 The summer season is going on, but it is still cold due to the above

 We sat on the mule, because the soil was very wet there
 dakshini kashmir ke himalayan kshetra main barf se dhanke pahaad or barf ko katkar banaaya gaya rasta behad durgam he
 The route along the Panchatarni river flowing thousands of feet is the most difficult climb
 kai baar is patale raste par agar yatri zyada hue to trephic jam bhi hojaataa he
 When asked the muleman Zahid, what precautions are needed to sit on the mule? In response, he said, 'sir, you have to keep balance on both sides and keep an eye out
 hair and der sar, or jaise chadhaai aae to bend farward down aae to vajan becoward karnaa he
 Asked about the trend of the horse, he said - 'yes sir, we give them 2 months training

 jharkhand kii jamshedpur pashchim seat se bhartiya janata party ke vidhayak sarayu raay ne 2014 ke chunaavon main congress ke ummidavaar banna gupta ko 10517 voton ke antar se haraaya tha
 Rai was made a cabinet minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party Chief Minister Raghubar Das's government, which came to an absolute majority after the 2014 elections
 sarayu raay bhrashtachar ke khilaaf satat sangharsh karte rahe hai
 He first exposed the animal husbandry scam in 1994
 baad main is ghotaale kii sibiai jaanch hui
 Saryu Rai struggled from the High Court to the Supreme Court to punish the perpetrators of the scam
 unke sangharsh kaa hi parinaam he ki argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav samet darjanon netaaon or afasaron ko jail janaa padaa
 Saryu Rai has been steadily fighting to end corruption
 raay ne 1980 main kisaanon ko die jane vaale ghatiya khaad, beej, tathaa nakli kitnashkon kaa vitaran karne vaali sahakaarita sansthaaon ke viruddh bhi aawaaj uthaai thi
 Then he made a strong movement to get compensation to the farmers, which was also successful
 sarayu raay ne hi sanyukt bihar main alkatraa ghotaale kaa bhi bhandaphod kiya tha
 Rai was also instrumental in exposing Jharkhand's mining scam
 unki pahchaan ghotaalon kaa pardaafash karne vaale netaa ke rup main bani
 Saryu Rai, a militant social activist, sharp journalist and a serious personality who pursued politics of issues and moral values, spent much of his life in Bihar
 haalanki saal 2000 main bihar rajya ke punagarthan ke baad unhone navgathit rajya jharkhand ko apni raajnneetik karmbhumi ke rup main chunaa, magar bihar main aaj bhi sarayu raay aarthik or saamaajik vishyon ke aise visheshgy ke rup main saraahe jate hai jinke kaaryon or uplabdhiyon ne vahaan kii raajnneeti or arthvyavastha par gaharaa or sthaayee prabhaav choda he
 The attempt to ban Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar, who is the head of the jaish-e-mohammed (JEM), for the second time in two years, has hit the Chinese wall
 30 aktubar ko china ke videsh mantralay ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad 1267 pratibandh samiti main ajahar ko pratibandhit suchi main daalane ke maamle par asahmatiyaan thim
 The committee, on a petition from the US, supported by Britain and France, pertains to al-qaeda, ISIS and its affiliates
 china ne is saal isse pehle bhi adhik jaankaree maangate hue ek takneekee roak laga di thi
 But with that moratorium coming to an end on November 2, Beijing has indicated its exercise of veto power to halt the process of banning Masood Azhar
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hua chuning ne kaha, ''ab tak samiti ke sadasyon ke bich sahmati banani baaki he
 The case against Azhar is very clear
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii yahi samiti ajahar ke sanghathan jeiem par roak lagane ke liye raji ho gai thi
 And just a few days ago, in September, five BRICS countries, including China, signed a joint statement at the Xiamen summit stating JEM a global concern
 beijing ke is hath kaa matlab kya he
 Publicly, Beijing officials say there is no 'concrete evidence' in the case
 hua ne kaha, ''hamaara maananaa he ki samiti ko vastunishthata, peshevarapan or nishpakshta kaa paalan karnaa chahie or thos sabooton ke aadhaar par aam sahmati banani chahie
 On the other hand, secretly, the Chinese authorities feel that the 'political motive' behind the banning of Azhar is working and its true friend Pakistan is being targeted
 pichley saal varisht chini adhikari lee baodong ne kaha tha ki hamen ‘‘aatankwaad se muqabla karne ke naam par raajnneetik phayda uthaane kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 Officials cite the case of Hashiz Saeed, the head of the lashkar-e-tayyiba who is roaming freely in Pakistan despite being placed on the ban list
 bhartiya adhikariyon ke mutabik, is tark main zyada dam nahin he
 He says that China's diplomatic armor is behind the shameless action of Pakistan — as seen in the case of Saeed
 china kaa yah tark khud uski hi is shikaayat ke vipareet he jisamen vah shinjiyang praant main aatankwaad par pashchimi deshon kii ore se ‘doharaa maapdand’ apnaane kii baat kahata rahaa he
 What are the options before India now
 bharat ajahar ke liye teesraa aavedan de saktaa he
 Maybe, he too has the same fate
 lekin isse kam se kam china kii chaal to ujagar hogi or duniya ko pataa chalegaa ki vah kis tarah kootnithik tareeke se apane ‘sachche dost’ kaa bachaav kar rahaa he
 What can be the relation of Delhi gangrape or other crimes against women with planetary constellations? Obviously, this question cannot have any meaning, but a minister from Chhattisgarh says that both of them have a deep bond

 com / niiibxr20d fifa world cap 2014 group-di kaa doosraa match england or italy ke bich manaaoos ke amegonia arena maidan main khelaa gaya
 Italy won an exciting victory over England
 italy ne england ko 2-1 se haraakar jeet apane naam kii
 The match was also seen as a match like the netherlands-spain
 is par bhi sabhi footbal premiyon kii nigahen thim
 In the first half hour of the game both teams were at naught
 italy ke khilaadi marshisio ne 35wein minute par pehla gol karke 1-0 se badhat banaai
 Just two minutes after that, England player Sturridge scored a goal for his team in the 37th minute to make it 1-1
 half time ke baad italy ke khilaadi beloteli ne 50wein minute par doosraa gol kiya or team ko jeet ke kareeb pahunchaa diya
 Black money is once again in the headlines
 supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad sarkaar ne ekasilband lipafousake paas bheja he jise adaalat nevishesh jaanch samitiko saunp diya he
 Regarding this list, the head of the committee, Justice MB Shah, says that there is nothing new in it
 ye vahi naam hai jo pehle bhi samiti ke paas aae the
 That is, after so much noise, nothing special came out
 iske pehle bhi sarkaar ne kuch naam bataae the jinhen dekhakar koi aashcharya nahin hua kyonki ve sabhi kaarobaari hai or aise kaarobaari jinka kaam videshon main bhi he
 From that list, the credibility of the government was shaken because people hoped that such names would be revealed which would surprise the people
 zyada ummid to yah thi ki kai rajanetaaon ke naam bhi aaenge kyonki arun jetali ne us ore ishaara bhi kiya tha
 But nothing seems to happen
 yah bahut hairaani or niraashaa kii baat he kyonki bijepi ne hameshaa videshon main chupe kaale dhan kaa mudda uthaaya or use rashtriya patal par rakhaa
 Now that he is in power, it is his duty to bring billions of dollars of black money abroad into India
 party ko na keval yah karnaa hoga balki ek iske jariye ek kadaa sandesh dena hoga ki yahaan kaa paisa videshon main le jane waalon kii koi khayr nahin he
 If the party thrives on patriotism, it will have to take some practical steps
 sirf lakeer kaa fakir bane rahane se kuch nahin hoga
 But the party must first arrange that black money does not exist
 yani use un kaarnon ko khatm karnaa hoga jinase kaaran kaala dhan paidaa hota he
 For this, many reforms will also have to be done in the tax system
 kaala dhan kaa ek kaaran he makaanon kii kharidari main tex chori
 The reason for this is that the state governments have kept the stamp duty so much that people tell only a part of the entire value of the house
 is kaaran bade paimaane par safed paisa kaala ho jaataa he
 Corrupt politicians charge huge commissions for getting the work done and all that money goes abroad from here
 kai udyogpati or kaarobaari apni aay sahi nahin bataate hai or unka bhi paisa kaale dhan ke rup main videshon main jamaa ho jaataa he
 Actually, sending money from abroad to India or from there is still very easy and hawala businessmen are sitting for this
 ab dekhnaa he ki bijepi chunavi ghoshnaa patr ke is hisse ko kab or kitni shiddat se lagu kar paati he
 On this, his reputation depends and also the development of the country's economy
 philhal sarkaar ke paas aisi koi jaadu kii chadi nahin dikh rahi he jiske istemaal se kaala dhan kaa pataa lag jaae or vah baahar aa jaae
 BJP has to understand that there is a limit to the patience of the public and it will not be a right idea to test it
 vipakshi sadasyon ke hangaamaa ke bich sansadeey kaarymantri vijay goyal ne modi sarkaar ko dalit virdohi bataane ko lekar congress kii aalochana kii
 Expressing his displeasure over the behavior of the members, Naidu said, "many bills are pending
 log vikaas or kanoon chaahate hai
 There will be no benefit from opposition
 main aapako har masale par vimarsh karne kii anumati dene ko taiyaar hum
 It is unfortunate that the posture is allowing discussion, but the member is not ready for it

 This seat was occupied by BJP from 1990 to 2013
 1980 main pehali baar bijepi ne is seat par jeet hasil kii thi

 From 1957 to 1977, there was a contest between the Hindu Mahasabha, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress and Janata Party

 M
 Singh of Bharatiya Jana Sangh won in 1966
 1972 main congress ke ai khan tarjee masharikul vidhayak bane
 In 1977, Sharif was elected Master Legislator of the Janata Party
 1985 ke chunaav main congress ke govardhan upaadhyaay ne bijepi ke ghanashyamdaas garg ko haraaya tha
 After 1985, the Congress won this seat in 2013
 2013 ke chunaav main govardhan ne bijepi ke lakshmikant ko 1584 voton se haraaya tha
 At the same time, in the 2008 elections, bjp's Laxmikant Sharma won
 unhone congress ke bundell singh yadav ko 9 hajaar se zyada voton se haraaya tha
 Issues of employment, health and education are important in this seat
 yahaan par naa koi bada uddog he or naa hi koi shikshan santhaan he
 There is a shortage of doctors in the district hospital here
 uddog, shiksha or swasthya ke maamle main ye kshetra pichhadaa hua he
 This area is still far from the railway line
 iske alaava berogari bhi badi samasya he
 Talking of tickets, Congress can give ticket to current MLA Govardhan Upadhyay, while BJP can field former MLA Laxmikant Sharma
 2013 ke chunavi nattijeymadhya pradesh main kul 231 vidhansabha siten hai
 Elections are held on 230 seats while one member is nominated
 2013 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 165, congress ko 58, basapa ko 4 or anya ko teen siten mili thim

 main unki aalochana nahin kar rahaa hum lekin hamaare madhya pradesh ke noujvaan vanchit rah jate hai unhen tabhi ab incentive kaa laabh milegaa jab 70 fisadi rojgaar madhya pradesh ke sthaneey logon ko denge
 'kamal Nath said that people come to Madhya Pradesh from states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 lekin sthaneey logon ko naukari nahin mil paati he
 i have approved the file related to this
 iske alaava unhone soobe main 4 garment parkon kii shuruyaat kaa bhi elaan kiya
 Kamal Nath said that we have taken this first step to create employment opportunities for the local people
 un industries ko hi pramot kiya jayega, jo soobe ke logon ko rojgaar main praathamikta denge
 After taking the oath of Chief Minister, Kamal Nath signed the file for reservation in employment, along with the loan waiver of farmers by Rahul Gandhi
 kamalnath ne kaha, 'maine shapath lene ke baad pehali file kisaanon ke karj maafee kii paas kii, jiskaa vaada hamane chunaav se pehle apane vachan patr main kiya tha
 With this order, short-term crop loans of up to Rs 2 lakh given by government and cooperative banks to farmers will be waived
 saal 2004 ke olympix main 1500 meter kii daud main ithiopia kaa pratinidhitiv kar chukin aath maheene kii garbhvatee meskerem legese kii maut ho gai he
 However, the doctor managed to save his child
 legese america ke connecticut rajya ke westport main rah rahi thim
 According to the information, she was having lunch with her two-year-old son in a restaurant when she suddenly fainted and fell down
 unhen jald hi aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan doctor unhen bachaa nahin paae
 The film's cause of death has not been known

 According to his friend Fatima Sene, Legesse's career quickly ended due to illness
 sene ke mutabik, 'legese pregnancy ke dauraan apana bahut zyada dhyaan rakhti thim
 She used to eat food thoughtfully and drink only water
 jab legese ko pataa chalaa ki ve ek beti kii maa banane vaali hai, to unki khushi kaa koi thikaana nahin tha
 Significantly, she was eliminated in the heat round before the 1500 meters race at the 2004 Athens Olympics

 desh ke aath rajyon kii 10 vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaav ke nattejey guuruuvaar ko aae hai
 The result of one of these seats, which was eyeing the entire country, was Rajouri Garden seat of Delhi
 ye seat aap vidhayak jaranel singh ke istife ke baad khaali hui thi
 On Thursday, where the bjp-akali coalition candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa won by 14 thousand 652 votes, the Aam Aadmi Party candidate did not survive the bail
 dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar or unki aam aadmi party ke liye ye mahaj ek seat par haar kaa masalaa nahin he balki is ek haar ne party or sarkaar ke liye kai chunautiyaan khadi kar di hai
 1-chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's position will be shaken by this defeat because he no longer has the charisma that was in the Delhi Assembly elections, i
e
 the brand Kejriwal has got a shock
 arvind ke faislon par ab tak party main dabe swar main aawaaj uthati rahi he lekin ab ye awaajen mukhar ho sakati hai
 The tweet of poet and AAP leader Kumar Vishwas also indicates something similar
 haar ke baad kumaar ne twit kiya-pani aankh main bharkar laayaa ja saktaa he / ab bhi jalataa shahar bachaaya ja saktaa he
 The 2-MCD elections are due next week and before that the situation of the Aam Aadmi Party can be gauged from the outcome of the by-election
 agar aise nattejey rahe to emsidi par aap ke kabje kaa plan fail ho saktaa he
 The way the Congress has distributed votes is indicating its revival in Delhi and this is going to be difficult for the Aam Aadmi Party
 3-party gujarat chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahi he lekin upachunaav main haar bataati he ki uski dilli kii jameen hi khisak rahi he kyonki party sirf haari nahin he balki buree tarah haari he
 Her vote percentage has dropped drastically and she has not been able to save her bail
 mahaj do saal kii avadhi ko dekhte hue ye nattejey party ke liye chintaneey hai
 4-so far, three BJP mlas in the Legislative Assembly have been making trouble for Hejkariwal, but now their number has increased to 4
 aap ke 21 vidhayakon par chunaav ayog se karrwai kii talwaar lataki he
 If they are disqualified and the AAP is unable to maintain its performance in these seats, then the future of the party will come into question
 5-sirf kejariwal hi nahin balki dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi sawaal uthenge
 It is clear from the election results that the government has failed to respond to the opposition's campaign against itself and its image is being tarnished among the public
 kejariwal sarkaar bhale hi janata ke bhale ke liye kaam karne ke kitne bhi daawey kare lekin janata usase mutmain nahin dikh rahi

 The countdown for Lok Sabha election results has started
 desh ke sabase bade chunaav ke nattejey aane main mahaj do din baaki hai
 But before the results, the exit poll has brought political clout and predicted Narendra Modi to once again reach the pinnacle of power
 itnaa hi nahin, modi tsunami main bhartiya janata party ke sahyogiyon ke bhi achche din aate hue najar aa rahe hai
 One such ally is Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) bihar kii raajnneeti karti he or 2014 main usne apane dam par loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha
 jdu's performance in this election was very disappointing
 soobe ke mukhyamantri hone ke baavjood nitish kumaar apni party ko mahaj 16% vot share ke saath 2 siten jitaane main kaamyaab rahe the
 This was jdu's worst result in a decade
 isse pehle 2009 main jediu bihar kii sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or usne kul 40 main se akele 20 loksabhaa siton (24% vot) par jeet darj kii thi
 Whereas BJP 12, RJD 4 and Congress 2 won only
 yani is chunaav main centre main congress kii sarkaar hone ke baavjood bihar main sushasan babu nitish kaa jaadu chalaa
 However, this wind of Nitish Kumar when he was in the NDA with BJP
 donon partiyon ne bihar main gathbandhan main chunaav ladaa or milakar ekatarfa jeet hasil kii
 Looking at the political history of Nitish Kumar, he got an opportunity to assume important responsibilities with the support of BJP
 nitish ko gathbandhan raajnneeti kaa maahir mana jaataa he
 In 1996, openly supporting the BJP, Nitish Kumar was part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the center
 iske baad 2005 main bijepi ke sahyog se hi wo bihar ke mukhyamantri bane or unka ye safar ab tak jari he
 However, Nitish once left the BJP in this path
 2013 main nitish kumaar ne endie se alag hone kaa faisla kar sabko chaunkaa diya
 It is believed that he took this decision after BJP declared Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 is bich nitish ke tevar bhi bijepi ke prati sakht ho gaye or unhone 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main ek lalu prasad yadav ke saath milakar ek nae gathbandhan ko janm diya or phir se mukhyamantri ban gaye
 However, Nitish did not like Lalu's company and Nitish Kumar left the RJD in 2017 to form the government with the support of the BJP, taking recourse to corruption charges leveled against the then deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav
 is tarah nitish kumaar kii endie main ghar vaapasi ho gai or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab seat bantwaare kaa number aayaa to bijepi ko unhen apane baraabar hi 17 siten deni padin
 In this way, JDU, which won 2 seats in 2014, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on 17 seats and the exit poll estimates of Aaj tak-axis My India suggest that BJP-JDU-LJP alliance is doing a clean sweep in Bihar
 23 may ko chunaav nattejey agar aise hi rahete hai to nishchit hi siton ke lihaaj jediu kaa graph kaaphi badhegaa or bijepi ke saath aakar unke achche din jarur aa jaaenge

 yahi vajah he ki congress in dinon rajya main gaay, narmada, mandir or ab ram kii baat karne lagi he
 Due to this, the Congress started the 'ram Van Gaman Path Yatra' from Chitrakoot on Tuesday
 pehle to is yatra ko lekar is baat par asamanjas tha ki pitrupaksh ke kaaran yatra tal sakati he
 but that did not happen
 ab yatra 15 din tak 35 vidhansabha kshetron se hote hue gujaregi

 kendriya mantri wike singhshaam saadhe saat baje paak ucchayog pahunche the - or 10 minute baad chal die
 At 10 he made the first tweet - followed by four tweets, in which he spoke of 'duty' and 'dissent'
 # DUTYA task or action that a person is bound to perform for moral or legal reasons— Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh)march 23, 2015 # dutythe force that binds one morally or legally to one's obligations— Vijay Kumar Singh (@gen_vksingh)march 23, 2015paak ko naseehat or chetavanidin main pradhanmantri modi ne twit kar pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko pakistan ke rashtriya diwas par badhai dene kii jaankaree di or duusare twit main naseehat, 'meraa maanaghna he ki bharat-pakistan ko baatcheet se sari samasyaon kaa hal nikaalnaa chahie

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj was also invited, but she stayed away from it
 apni 'duty' maanakar singh kaarykram main pahunche bhi

 In the presence of Hurriyat leaders with whom Pakistan had stopped talks with Pakistan due to the meeting of Hurriyat leaders last year, Singh had to join the program
 ek faujee main leadership kii sooyeeboojh to kuta kuta kar bhari hoti he, lekin raajnneetik or rajanyik chaturaai kam ho sakati he

 What could Singh and Kar also do

 Singh remained silent
 lekin baat jab pakistan kii ho, or uske stand ko saport karanevaalon kii ho to chup rahanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Singh's latest tweets are indicating this
 haalanki, nishane par unhone media ko liya

 vaise hi netaa bhi sirf libaas se nahin hota
 Due to punctuality, even if the army has to give a uniform leg and wear new clothes - its own personality is almost ineffective
 wike singh kii hari jacket [jo sanyogvash yaa jaanboojh kar jaise bhi pahani gai ho] bhi pakistan yaa paak parast hurriyat netaaon ke prati na to dharna badal saki or na hi diplomasi ke siddhanton ke tahat khud ko dhaalnaa sikhaa pai

 bahut se log yah nahin jaanate honge ki saal 2004 main sanyukt raashtra ke maadak padaarth or aparaadh karyaalay ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek vyapak sandhi kaa dastavej jari kiya tha

 'sangakkara wants to quit Test cricket too! what rubbish! Such an important decision cannot be left on them! ye twit he mashhoor camentator harsha bhogale kaa
 Cricket pundits and cricket fans around the world can not be separated from this
 kumaar chokashnada sangakaara
 Khabu batsman and wicketkeeper
 kisi khilaadi kaa kariyar kitna lanbaa ho iske liye tay tamaam maapdandon ko ye khilaadi lagaataar jhuthla rahaa he
 Not taking the name of stopping at the age of 37
 umr kaa asar na ta fitaness par he or na hi form par
 The form is so powerful that he has hit 4 consecutive centuries in the ongoing ICC World Cup in Australia and New Zealand
 bangladesh ke khilaaf 105, england ke khilaaf 117, australia ke viruddh 104 or or scotland ke khilaaf 124 ran
 Has the World Cup been played in 3632 ODI matches so far, no one has done this feat
 sachin tendulkar ne twit kiya, 'lagaataar 4 shatak! jabardast ballebaazi or gazab kaa form
 ' isi world cap main australia ke kilaaf unhone 14 hajaar ranon kaa aankada bhi chhu liya
 In the odis, only Sachin Tendulkar is ahead of him with 18,246 runs
 test main sabase zyaada ran banane waalon main ve paanchave number par hai
 Next to them are Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Zac Kallis and Rahul Dravid
 test main unka ausat 58
 Is 66
 pichley 47 saal main isse behatar ausat kisi bhi khilaadi kaa nahin rahaa he
 Not only this, you may be surprised to know that among the batsmen who have scored more than 5000 runs in Tests, their average is less than just two players - Sir Don Bradman and Ken Barrington
 world cap ke baad kumaar sangakaara vanade ko alavida kehane vaale hai
 In August, he will also retire from the Test after a 3-test series with India
 kya is ballebaaz ko yon hi sanyas lene dena chahie? shaayad sangakaara us durlabh or luptpraaya prajati se hai jinka maananaa rahaa he ki asal champion vahi he jo chotii par rahete khel ko vidaa kah de
 It surprises that in the last years of his career, Sangakkara has emerged as the most successful batsman in the world
 aankade is baat kii tasadeeq karte hai
 If all the three formats of cricket are combined, Sangakkara has scored the most runs in the world in the last 5 years
 unhone in paanch saal main 269 maichon main 14211 ran banaae hai
 This includes 35 centuries and 85 half-centuries
 duusare number par tillakaratne dilashaan unase kareeb 4 hajaar ran peeche hai
 AB de Villiers is at number three, Hashim Amla fourth, Mahela Jayawardene fifth and India's Virat Kohli at number six
 pichley 3 saal main unka ausat ghatane kii bajaae badhaata gaya he
 His test average in 2013 was 91
 40, 2014 main 71
 09 and 104 this year
 00 tak pahunch gaya he
 This is the same story in odis
 2013 main unka ausat 63
 91, 46 last year
 51 or is saal badhkar 90
 Is 77
 15 saal pehle 22 saal ke kanoon ke ek chaatr ne antarrashtriya cricket main kadam rakhaa tha tab hi cricket ke jaankaron ne kah diya tha ki saumy or shant dikhne vaala ye shaks kamyaabi kii ek nai kahani likhane ja rahaa he
 They were not mistaken
 2006 main mahela jayavardhane ke saath unhone colombo ko sinhalaij sports club maidan par dakshin africa ke kilaaf 624 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 That too in front of bowlers like Dale Steyn and Makhaya Antini
 sangakaara ne 287 ranon kii yaadgaar pari kheli
 a year later, his innings of 192 runs at Hobart was also tremendous
 kumaar sangakaara ne apane pradarshan se kai nai ibaaratein likhi
 It is considered extremely difficult for a wicketkeeper to bat at number 3
 lekin sangakaara ne ise bhi aasaan bana diya he
 Often the right-handed batsman's cut and pull is considered to be graceful and visible, but the left-handed Sangakkara also broke this myth
 ye unki kabaliyat hi he ki ipel main unhen har frenchiji unhen apni team main rakhana chahta he
 Obviously, this player did not get the fame he deserved
 agast main sangakaara ke sanyas ke baad ye prashn adhuraa rah jayega- agar kumaar sangakaara ritair nahin hote to or kitne record tuutate

 This decision means that the Sialkot Stallions team led by Shoaib Malik will represent Pakistan in the tournament in October, as they have won the domestic T20 title
 shrinivasana ne kaha, bisisiai yah sifarish sanchaalan parishad ko karegaa
 The Champions League T20 is owned by BCCI, Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa
 ham sanchaalan parishad ko sifarish karenge ki bisisiai ko koi aapatti nahin he or vah champions lig main pakistan se team ko aamantrit karne ko taiyaar he
 Srinivasan said, the Champions League will be played in India

 The BCCI will make a recommendation to the Governing Council, which will decide on the matter
 bisisiai ko apane is kadam ke liye padosi desh se saraahna milane kii ummid he, kyonki pakistan cricket board, 2009 main champions lig ke pehle toornament se apni team ko is toornament main shaamil karaane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 The comments yah poochne par ki kya yah faisla pakistan ke prati rukh main badlaav he, to shrinivasana ne kaha, yah mudda champions lig kii sanchaalan parishad ke samaj rakhaa jayega
 So this year, apart from the combination of the tournament and the number of teams, it will also be discussed who to invite
 unhone kaha, yah ahsaas jataayaa ki gaya he ki pakistan se bhi team ko aamantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Asked if this was a step towards resuming bilateral cricket ties with Pakistan, Srinivasan said, "today's decision is limited to the Champions League
" isliye main isse aage kuch nahin kahana chahta
 No bilateral series have been played between the two countries since the Mumbai terror attack and the two countries have clashed only in tournaments of several countries such as the World Cup
 november, 2008 main hue aatanki hamale ne donon padosi deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya cricket sambandhon par viraam lagane ke alaava pakistan ke khilaadiyon ko lubhaavni indian premier lig main khilne se bhi maharoom kar diya tha
 "the Executive Committee has decided to invite the team from Pakistan for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament," board president n Srinivasan told reporters after the board's executive committee meeting
 is faisle kaa matlab he ki shoeb malik kii aguai vaali sialkot stallians kii team oktober main hone vaali pratiyogita main pakistan kaa pratinidhitiv karegi, kyonki usne gharelu tii-20 khitaab jeeta he
 Srinivasan said, the BCCI will make this recommendation to the Governing Council
 champions lig tii-20 par bisisiai, cricket australia or cricket dakshin africa kaa malikana haq he
 We will recommend to the Governing Council that the BCCI has no objection and is willing to invite the team from Pakistan to the Champions League
 shrinivasana ne kaha, champions lig bharat main kheli jaaegi
 As far as inviting the Pakistan team is concerned, it will be done by the Governing Council
 bisisiai sanchaalan parishad ko sifarish karegaa, jo is maamle main faisla karegi
 The BCCI hopes to receive appreciation from the neighboring country for its move, as the Pakistan Cricket Board is attempting to involve its team in the tournament from the first Champions League tournament in 2009
 tippaniyan Asked if the decision was a change in attitude towards Pakistan, Srinivasan said, the issue will be taken up by the Governing Council of the Champions League
 isliye is saal toornament ke sangyojan or tiimon kii sankhya ke alaava is par bhi charchaa hogi ki kise aamantrit kiya jaae
 He said, it has been realized that the team can be invited from Pakistan too
 yah poochne par ki kya yah pakistan ke saath dwipaksheeya cricket sambandh dobaaraa shuru karne kii disha main kadam he, shrinivasana ne kaha, aaj kaa faisla champions lig tak simit he

 memoirsdillishar Dar citynirmala Jainrajkamal Prakashan, Dariyaganj, New Delhi-2 Price: Rs 250
 puraani dilli main nnagalib smarampani is kitaab ke jariye nirmala jain ne yah ehsaas shiddat ke saath karaayaa he ki dilli jaise shahar ko kis tapaak se dekhen
 The wonders of this book (and the writer's) is that the forgotten Delhi and Delhi concessions, the centers of life, the dialect, the street, the neighborhoods, the neighborhoods - once again come alive
 jain ne jis jadgabe, ehtaraam or anubhavon ke saath dilli ko taharir kiya he, uskaa tasawwur, tilism-sa rach detaa he
 Street-walker, Rahgu
 jar, sadaken, imaaraten, haweliyaan-keval vivaran nahin ho jaatin
 They also have pasamanjar, kisasagoi, which produces Kashish
 unhone dilli ke dil ko apni bhashaa main utaara
 And with great advice, reached the soul of Delhi
 dilli shahar ko ve uske jugrafiye tak simit nahin rakhti, tavaarish or taharik tak pahunchati hai
 This type of writing, rather than a city name, makes one feel the beats of its era and era
 mohallon, koochon kii sanrachana ke atirikt, rahan-sahan rakh-rakhaav, naam-liha
 J, the writer has gone on writing the beautiful relationship between hindu-muslims in short words but with warmth of memories
 ve bataati hai ki puraani dilli ke nivaasiyon main musalamaanon ke atirikt, khatri, jain, baniyon, kaaysthon ke bhi ghar the
 But everyone had a warm relationship
 yah lekhika ke shandaar anubhavon or sansmaranon kii kitaab he
 The first four to five chapters are written about the culture and lifestyle of Old Delhi
 is kitaab kaa ye hissaa bemisaal he
 Later, the writer also begins to feel a sense of anger when he reveals his thoughts about disgraced people and (disorganized) Delhi
 jahaar karti hai
 Despite this, Chapter 14 explores the map and footsteps of Delhi and the corner-holes and veil as realistic as it is
 puraani dilli par likhte hue lekhika ne tilism rachaa he, to nai dilli (leuton kii dilli) ke tamir hone kaa vivaran jitna aitihaasik he, utana rochak bhi
 The specialty of Jain's writing is also that she does not set up a web of information
 soochna or gyaan kaa fark ve samajhti hai
 Therefore, this book becomes the knowledge of Delhi, rejecting the information of Delhi
 jain ke paas smritiyon kaa saramaaya he or paripakv anubhav
 It is from these elements that she sets out to find Delhi - from Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi to the sports village of Delhi and Delhi till then, vaishali-pitampura
 jahaan jain kaa ghar tha or aamadar
 So much noise in the house that the house had to be changed
 jain aazaadee ke baad kii suuratehaal bayaan karti hai-dange, sharnaarthiyon kaa aagaman, gandhiji kii hatya, dilli kaa betaratib failte chale janaa (gauratlab he ki ve sharnaarthiyon kii kahin bekadri nahin karatin)
 The truth is that in the whole book they understand human values and the search for those 'centers' is their search for Delhi
 jain 'secular athiks' tathaa 'liv-tugedar' kii bhaavana ko baar-baar, bade sachchepan ke saath vyakt karti hai
 After Old Delhi, when the author talks about politics and education and the changing life craft of Delhi, his own language also did not change
 jar aati he
 Somewhere there are news papers, diary comments somewhere, and memoirs somewhere

 Nagendra, Dr
 namvar singh ajit kumaar, shila sandhu (raajakmal kii sarvesarva) bharatbhushan agarwal or model toun kii shaamein or adbi nashistein
 They are like a living memoir

 Can be read (and kept) like j
 shiksha jagat, dilli vishvavidhyalay or sahitya kii, is kitaab main lekhika ne shandaar jagah banaai he
 Writing on the dreaded phase of the Emergency, the writer has pinpointed the opportunism of many important writers (names have also been tahrir)
 aapatkaal ke samarthan ke vishay main ve likhti hai, ''un dinon lekhakon / patrakaron ko is kaam ke liye, gher kar le jane kaa daayitv shrikant verma ne odh rakhaa tha
 '' Jain said Dr
 nagendra par bahut vistaar se likhaa he
 His dictatorial attitude, his demeanor, stubborn attitude have all been clearly written by the author
 lekin is ranjish, sanjeeda or kasheeda vaataavaran ke barakes doosraa vaataavaran bhi he jisamen dow
 There is a presence of Bashaur personality like Namwar Singh, then Ajit Kumar and Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal

 The tracks containing the books of Daryaganj

 It would have been nice if she had also written something on the insane presence of the World Book Fairs
 india international par to unhone kaaphi kuch likhaa
 But many institutions of Delhi
 zikr tak nahin
 Urdu jabaan par bhi kuch nahin kaha
 Four girls, who were brought to Delhi by swindle of jobs and then forced into sex trade, have been freed by the police
 isamen do ladkiyaan assam kii hai
 Four people have been arrested in this connection
 aropiyon kii pahchaan sandip kumaar urf vikrant, uski patni aaysha begum, chandan kumaar or sunil mishra ke rup main kii gai he
 The police raided two different places in Delhi yesterday and arrested the accused
 chaaron ladakiyon ko mukt karaayaa
 On the night of 25 July, a girl called the police after which they could be saved
 vah police ko vistrut pataa nahin bataa saki thi or phone bich main cat gaya tha
 After this, on the basis of suspicion, the police saved these girls by raiding them
 upi main basic shiksha parishad ke praathmik vidyalayon main shikshakon ke antarajanapadiya tabadale kii niti tay ho gai he
 This time 17 thousand teachers will be transferred
 tabadale kii praathamikta tay karne ke liye chah shreniyan banaai gai hai
 Online applications will be accepted for transfer only
 yah faisla buudhvaar ko nideshaalay main hui basic shiksha parishad kii baithak main liya gaya
 Every year the basic education officers adjusting the teachers in the schools of their district will not be able to do so now
 vishesh paristhitiyon main keval ikkaa-dukka samaayojan hi is baar honge
 This has been done to prevent the rigging of transfers in the name of adjustment

 ) Indian skipper Virat Kohli, while praising his teammates for the pressure shown under pressure, credited Shikhar Dhawan and Dinesh Karthik for their second one-day international cricket win over Zimbabwe on Friday
 bharat ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue chaar wicket 65 ran par ganvaa die the jiske baad dhawan (116) or karthik (69) ne paanchaven wicket ke liye 167 ran jodakar team ko majboot score tak pahunchaaya
 India finally managed to win the match by 58 runs
 kohli ne match ke baad kaha, ‘‘shuru main chaar wicket ganvaana acha nahin tha
 We made some mistakes
 dhawan or karthik ko shrey jaataa he kyonki is tarah ke wicket par khelnaa aasaan nahin tha
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘dhawan kaa bhagya ne saath diya lekin bhagya ke bhi do pahalu hote hai
 You may think that i did not bat well today or you think that today is my day
 dhawan se shandaar ballebaaji kii
 Karthik is sad that he could not complete the century and was run out
 ’’ The Indian captain, however, refused to believe that the team was in trouble due to losing the toss
 unhone kaha, ‘‘toss harkar hamen pehle ballebaaji bhi milti he to yah hamaare ballebaajon ke liye chunauti he
 '' kohli ne kaha, ‘‘ham vastav main acchhee cricket khel rahe hai
 Our team is new and we have to prove ourselves
 hamaare khilaadiyon ne aaj dabaav main behtareen khel dikhaaya
 '' kohli ne gendbaajon visheshkar jayadev unadakat kii bhi tarif kii
 Unadkat took four wickets for 41 runs
 unhone kaha, ‘‘unadakat lambey kad kaa gendbaaj he or usne sahi length se gend karai
 Apart from this, he also cleverly changed the pace
 mishra, vinay kumaar, jadeja ne bhi acchhee gendbaaji kii
 '' zimbabwe ke captain brendan tailor ne kaha ki dhawan or karthik ke bich kii saajhedaari unki team par baari padi
 Zimbabwe missed two catches of Dhawan which he took advantage of and scored a century and Taylor said that it was heavy on the team
 tippaniyan He said, "if you give a chance to a team like India, then you have to pay for it
 tas jeetna acha tha lekin us saajhedaari ne vastav main hamen maar diya
 '' tailor ne kaha ki unke senior khilaadiyon ko jimmedaari leni hogi
 He said, "our top-order batsmen and senior players will now have to accept the responsibility
 maidan par ham kaaphi dhime the or iskaa hamen kuch nuksaan bhi hua
 We need to find a solution before the next match
 ’’ Batting first, India lost four wickets for 65 runs, after which Dhawan (116) and Karthik (69) added 167 runs for the fifth wicket to bring the team to a strong score
 bharat aakhir main yah match 58 ran se jeetne main safal rahaa
 Kohli said after the match, "it was not good to lose four wickets in the beginning
 hamane kuch galtiyaan kii
 Dhawan and Karthik are credited as playing on such a wicket was not easy
 ’’ He said, "dhawan's luck supported him, but luck also has two aspects
" aap yah soch sakate ki aaj maine acchhee ballebaaji nahin kii yaa phir yah sochate ho ki aaj meraa din he
 He batted brilliantly with Dhawan
 karthik ko lekar dukh he ki vah shatak puraa nahin kar paaya or ran out ho gaya
 '' bhartiya captain ne haalanki yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki toss ganvaane se team mushkil main pad gayi thi
 He said, "if we get to bat first after losing the toss, then it is a challenge for our batsmen
" ’’ Kohli said, "we are playing really good cricket
 hamaari team nai he or hamen khud ko sabit karnaa he
 Our players today showed the best game under pressure
 ’’ Kohli also praised the bowlers, especially Jaydev Unadkat
 unadakat ne 41 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 He said, "unadkat is a tall bowler and got the ball with the right length
 iske alaava usne badi chaturaai se teji main badlaav bhi kiya
 Mishra, Vinay Kumar, Jadeja also bowled well
 ’’ Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor said that the partnership between Dhawan and Karthik overshadowed his team
 zimbabwe ne dhawan ke do kaich chode jiskaa unhone phayda uthaakar shatak jadaa or tailor ne kaha ki team par yah baari padaa
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat jaisi team ko yadi aap koi mauka dete ho to aapako uski keemat chukaani padati he
 It was good to win the toss but that partnership really killed us
 ’’ Taylor said his senior players would have to take responsibility
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamaare sheersh kram ke ballebaajon or senior khilaadiyon ko ab jimmedaari sweekaar kerani hogi
 We were very slow on the field and we also suffered some loss

 Sheila Dikshit, who has given the wind of development in Delhi, who makes Delhi livable, gives a new face - new identity to Delhi has said goodbye to Delhi forever

 Explain that Sheila Dixit's father-in-law Umashankar Dixit was a cabinet minister in Indira Gandhi's government
 vahiin shila dikshit kaa rishta gandhi parivaar se ban gaya tha
 Sheila Dixit in her autobiography Citizen Delhi: My Times, My Life has written about her proximity to the Gandhi family
 shila dikshit ne likhaa, 'ek din mere sasur umashankar dikshit ne indira gandhi ko khaane par bulaayaa or maine bhojan ke baad unhen garmagarm jalibiyon ke saath vanilla icecream parosi
 Sheila Dixit wrote, 'indira Gandhi liked my experiment very much
 agle hi din unhone apane rasoie ko isaki vidhi jaanane ke liye hamaare paas bheja
 After that many times we served this sweet to Indira Gandhi after dinner, but after killing Indira Gandhi, i stopped serving it to anyone
