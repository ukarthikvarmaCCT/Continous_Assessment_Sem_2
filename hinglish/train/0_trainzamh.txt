 Regarding this matter, the report of the Manoj Shrivastava Committee wrote, 'this is a wonderful episode in which almost the entire land of a city came into the hands of a single family

 According to the report, in 1995, through an incorrect order of the Collector, 1471 bigha land was transferred from the municipality and Madhya Pradesh government to the private party
 baad main ek anya colector ne is aadesh ko galat paaya or bhoomi sarkaar ke adheen laane ke liye rajasav mandal (revenue board) se maamle par dobaaraa gaur karne kii anumati maangi
 Instead of giving consent, the Revenue Board itself passed a detailed order giving the land to the government's ownership
 yah aadesh hycourt se khaarij ho gaya or hycourt ne punarvilokan (chaanbin) kii purvanumati di
 According to the report, after all the legal process, on 5 June 2007, the Collector ordered that some land be subrogated and the rest of the land given to the private party
 maje kii baat yah he ki nadi, pahaad, rasta or kabristaan jaisi jameen chhodane ke liye bhi colector ne nijee pakshakaar ko aadesh dene kii bajaae samajhaayaa ki vah janhit main bhoomi ko chhod den
 In the report, the order of the Collector was completely illegal, but no action was recommended on any officer

 The appeal period also ended but the case was reopened
 kuch samay pehle 2007 main colector ne bhi hamaare haq main faisla diya or jameen par hamaara naam chadhaane ko kaha tha, baad main revijan main colector ne hamen kuch jameen (jis par nadi he, shmashaan ghat aadi he) chhodane ko kaha to hamane chhod di

 bhel's 2,000 acres and 200 acres of Mafia were occupied by AIIMS
 On November 27, 1957, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd
 was vandalized by the land mafia on the precious land
 (biechiel) ko 6,000 acre se adhik jameen award kii
 The Manoj Shrivastava Committee said in its report that this land was awarded to BHEL as a company
 is maamle main koi aupchaarik transfar dead nahin hui
 Therefore, the BHEL administration or the central government does not have the right to assert ownership over this land
 report main kaha gaya ki adhigrahan ke baad se ab tak bhel ke paas kareeb 2,000 acre jameen phaltu padi he
 The report cites the 1998 circular of the Madhya Pradesh Revenue Department Ministry
 paripatr main vyavastha he, ‘rajya shashan dwaara nirnay liya gaya he ki pradesh main sthapit kendriya saarvajanik upakramon ko aavantit bhoomi main se aisi bhoomi jo unke dwaara nirdhaarit uddeshy ke liye upyog main nahin lari ja rahi, tatkaal waapas praapt kii jaae
 On this basis, the state government recommended the withdrawal of 2,000 acres of vacant land of BHEL
 iske alaava report main kaha gaya ki bhel apane kabje vaali jameen kii dekhbhaal bhi nahin kar paa rahaa he or ab tak 200 acre jameen par bhoomafia ne kabja kar liya he
 The 200 acres of land mentioned in the report, most of it has now become important in terms of real estate
 bhopal main ban rahe akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) ke saamne bhel kii jameen par bhi logon ne avaidh kabja kar rakhaa he or yahaan makaanon kaa nirmaan ab bhi jari he
 Due to AIIMS coming here, land prices in the area have increased very fast
 report par bhel kaa paksh rakhte hue bhel ke varisht prabandhak prachaar evam jansampark vinodanand jha ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak bhel ko bhoomi aavantit hone kaa sawaal he to sari kanoonee prakriyaaon kaa paalan kiya gaya he
 Yes, 150 acres of BHEL land have been illegally occupied by settlements
 inhen hataane ke liye rajya sarkaar se lagaataar patrachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The new illegal construction near AIIMS is monitored by the BHEL administration and is broken from time to time

 In this case, the private party got the land in 2008 due to an order of the Board of Revenue in which the Supreme Court order of 1991 was completely ignored

 The report said that after the term of the 25-year lease expired, the government took back the land in April 1979 through an order from the Additional District President
 iske baad company kii bhoomi kaa bada hissaa sarkari vibhaagon dwaara apane kabje main liya gaya
 But on March 20, 2008, the Revenue Board gave the shocking order and accepted the company's right to the land
 lekin board kaa yah aadesh dekhakar saaf lagata he ki faisla paksh vishesh ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya
 Raising serious questions on the order of the board, the Manoj Srivastava committee said in its report, 'the Supreme Court had rejected the order of the 1981 High Court which had made the basis of the 1981 board of the order
 duusari baat yah ki board main sunwaari ke dauraan shashan ke vakil khadey hokar puri tarah shashan ke viruddh or aavedak ke paksh main rajasav nyaayalay main bol rahe hai
 'the report clearly indicates how the entire administrative side was mobilized to benefit the Gwalior dairy
 jo jameen sarkaar ko mili he, vah bhi is rup main ki company ne vah jameen sarkaar ko daan di he
 However, there is a danger that the company may challenge tomorrow on what basis the government is donating this land when the company does not consider it
 maamle main company kaa paksh rakhte hue jain ne kaha, ‘pichley saal gwalior prashasan ne jalalpura ke paas 50 acre jameen ko apane kabje main le liya
 The matter is still in court and 42 acres of land is still in Maharajpura area in the name of Gwalior Dairy Limited, there is no dispute over the land

 beeti raat ranjana kaa bhai himanshu bhi unke ghar aayaa hua tha
 Jayaprakash and Ranjana had a fight over something in the night

 kai log aapako jad (you) main number 2 kehete hai
 i feel very uncomfortable with this tag
 ye jo nitish kaa uttaradhikari, party kaa bhavishya yaa number 2 hone kii baaten hai, yah bas logon ke dimag kii upaj hai
 i have been in the party for two-three months
 main bihar ko thodaa samajhataa hum par itnaa bhi nahin ki number do, number teen hone kaa daawa karun
 Where did you study and study in a government school? phir patna science college aa gaya
 Maths was good, even if the householders wanted, they took maths
 hindu college main statisticks le liya
 But left from there due to ill health
 grajuation lakhanu se kiya
 Then went to Hyderabad, went to America, did not follow any routine of engineering, doctor then civil service
 har do saal main padhai chhod di
 Left three years after the twelfth, then two years after graduation
 mere pitaaji anshan par baith jate the
 They used to say go back, study
 aap modi ke saath aae or phir saath chhot bhi gaya
 What happened? If your question is why i split up, it is not because of what you study
 chunaav ke pehle se hi unke saath ek soch bani ki bharat main civil services main latural-entry kii bahut jarurat he
 We wanted to create an institution for that only
 aisi sanstha jo prime ministar offis ke saath kaam kare
 We worked on it with Accenture and mckenzie
 unki (modi kii) sahmati bhi thi
 It also cost a lot of money
 lekin 2014 ke chunaav ke baad unki vyastata bad gai
 They wanted to stay for a while
 main bahut impeshent aadmi hum
 Then in october-november i felt that the matter was not being made here
 pehali baar main nitish ji se november main mila
 i met Nitish Kumar at Pawan Varma's house
 ek hi meeting main unhone kaha ki aap saath aa jaaie
 Narendra Modi did not stop? Stopped a lot
 main november (2014) se nitish ji ke saath kaam kar rahaa tha, par bihar aayaa tha 2 june 2015 ko
 This was a period of six months in which the conversation with him (modi) continued
 par unhen bhi shaayad laga ki agar main jaakar kuch or karnaa chahta hum to thik he
 They know my nature
 or phir pike khud netaa ban gaye
 absolutely
 pehle raajnneeti main aane kaa vichaar nahin tha
 Then my experience of four to five years was that no matter how much you advise, (they) should not agree after winning your case
 mere paas akjampal donon hi the
 Modiji did not listen to the temperament at that time, Nitishji did not agree, but in both the situations i could not achieve what i wanted
 to phir maine politics join kii
 When Nitish again befriended BJP? Nitish Kumar's decision was a political decision
 yah bihar ke nazariye se thik he
 i think their decision was fine, but the way wrong
 jab ve waapas bhaajapa ke saath gaye to unhen nae sire se janadesh lenaa chahie tha
 What was the matter with Lalu? Lalu spoke to him about his well being in AIIMS
 political baat bhi hui, isamen koi do mat nahin
 i am not talking to them about Tejashwi
 amit shah ke bare main kya khyaal he?bahut karmath vyakti hai
 i have not worked with him very long, but i understand that Amit Shah understands the way to contest the traditional elections
 kaaryakartaaon kii or party kii sanghathanaatmak chizon kii unki samaj or netaaon kii tulana main behatar he
 Why did pk's mission fail in UP? After winning Bihar, i met Rahul Gandhi at Nitish's swearing in ceremony
 unhone kaha ki aaie hamaari madad kariye
 Then there was a discussion in February 2016
 teen maheene upi kii khaak chhaani or ek plan banaaya
 Rahul's Kisan Yatra was part of that plan
 30 din devaria se lekar dilli tak
 i told them that once you sit on the bus in Deoria, till you reach Delhi, you have to stay in UP
 devaria kii yatra hui to congress main yah baat ho gai ki ab badi hawa ban gai he or unhone use bhanja liya
 Akhilesh Yadav, who is not getting a seat today, gave 110 seats to Congress
 to thodi bahut grass root par congress kii jo sugabugahat shuru hui thi, usko unhone elliance karke ancash kar liya, jo baad main dizaster sabit hua
 What happened to Uddhav Thackeray? i have talked to him many times
 un mulakaaton kaa silsilaa shuru hua, vah uttar bharatiyon par unki party ko lekar stand par tha
 Seeing the data and things, i tried to convince them that whatever is ideologically, it will not get benefit in the election
 unako baat samaj main ai
 i started talking to him in that context
 pike ke sanghathan ipac vaale kisi bhi party kaa political campan kaise chunate hai?criteria kabhi bachapanaa vaala hota he ki punjab main dikhaa denge ki aap se behatar campaner ham hai, kabhi criteria yah he ki priyanka ko main launch karuunga or upi main sabase badi jeet main hasil kar saktaa hum
 He was the Criteria of U
P
 nitish ji ke saath aakar kaam karne kaa criteria yah tha ki bhai modiji ke saath kaam kiya or modiji ne nitish ji ko buree tarah yahaan haraaya tha
 So we said that the Modi army has defeated those in the Modi wave, if you reverse it, then you will say that you know something
 lekin sirf inhen baton par to disijan hota nahin he, or kai factors hote hai
 The decision to become a leader? There is also a powerlessness in this decision
 punjab main ek ghatana hui, jisane mere faisle ko badla
 a promise was made for contract workers in Punjab
 punjab main maine nau nukte vaale chunaav kaa prachaar kiya tha
 There is a promise regarding contractual employees
 ek saal baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki sanvida karmchaaree dharne par baithe the or mukhyamantri se nahin mil paa rahe the
 He took out an advertisement in the newspaper that who would meet us with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, he would be given a reward of one lakh rupees
 aap ke vidhayak or vipaksh ke netaa aman aroda ne is aid ko twit kiya or kaha ki desh main sabase bada frod prashanth kishor he, kyonki chunaav se pehle 'har ghar captain, ghar-ghar captain', 'coffee vid captain' or chunaav ke baad no ware captain
 Call this man and stand him in front of the public
 usee vakt yah samaj aayaa ki promis karne vaale se zyada karwaane vaale ko log dhundhate hai
 i felt that now the time has come to leave it, because another one makes mistakes and then for a long time people consider you as fraud
 aap paise ke liye kaam nahin kar rahe hai to koi bada gol to hona chahie life main
 He saw Gol JD (U)? He showed Gol about coming to Bihar
 meraa yah kamitment he ki agle 10 saal main bihar ko top 10 main aane kii jugat lagaani chahie
 There has been a lot of development in Bihar in 14 years under Nitish's rule, but it is also true that in most of the development parameters, Bihar is in the bottom five
 isliye bihar ko yah koshish kerani chahie ki vikaas ke zyaadaatar maanakon main ham top 10 main kaise aaen or us agenda ko puraa karne main nitish ji kii jo madad main kar paaun, uske liye lautakar yahaan aayaa hum
 Books that worked in politics
 paralal licras
 On Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru
 choti-si kitaab he
 Rudranshu Mukherjee has written
 agar aap usko padhenge to pataa chalegaa ki gandhi ne kyon bose kii bajaae nehru ko chunaa
 i also record Wisdom of Crowd
 or aakhir main maai experiment vid truth, jise har bhartiya ko padhuya chahie
 Small mouth is a big thing for Gandhi, but if you do not like anything about Gandhi, then understand that you have not developed the understanding to understand Gandhi

 RBSE 12th Arts Result It is the last day of the Lord's Test and Team India, led by Captain Cool MS Dhoni, is on the threshold of creating history once again after 28 years
 cricket ke makka kahe jane vaale is maidan par team india ko mahaj ek baar hi jeet naseeb hui he wo bhi 28 saal pehle 1986 main
 Then under the captaincy of Kapil Dev, India defeated the hosts by 5 wickets, however the team has longed for victory on this ground since then
 lekin ab lag rahaa he 28 saal kaa intjaar khatm hone vaala he
 Such figures, which make the claim of Team India's victory strong: 1) In Test cricket, India has given more than 300 scores to the opposing team 23 times
 isamen use bas ek baar hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he jabaki 11 baar match bharat jeeta he or itane hi baar match drow bhi hua he
 2) Dhoni has never lost a Test match when he has given the target of more than 100 runs to the other team
 aise 9 maichon main bharat ne 4 baar jeet hasil kii he, jabaki 5 drow hue hai
 3) The figures of the Lords are also disturbing to England
 chauthi pari main 319 ran chej kar rahi english team bhi jaanati he ki 41 maukon main se do baar hi yahaan koi team 250 se zyada ke score ko chej kar pai he
 4) The highest score that England has won by chasing in this match is 282 runs
 2004 main newjiland ke khilaaf england ne 282 ranon kaa target hasil karke jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, Team India's target of 319 runs can prove to be a mountain for England
 5)england ne test cricket main jo sabase zyada ran chej kiya he wo he 332 ran
 After achieving this target against Australia in 1928, the second best target is 315 runs, which is less than India's current 319 runs

 Mohsin Khan was seen in a royal blue colored sherwani and churidar pajamas
 bataa den ki apane shahar main in do kalakaaron ko dekhakar phens kii khushi dekhte hi ban rahi thi
 By the way, videos of both stars are going viral on social media
 in dinon tivi sho 'ye rishta kya kehalaata he' main naira or karthik kii lav life ek baar phir paravaan chadh rahi he
 But there is a clear possibility of any trouble in the show

 At present, the whole family is very happy with Naira returning home
 iske pashchaat roopa ganguli uniwarsity campus pahunchin or un chaar vyaktiyon kii rihaai kii maang karne lageen jinhen baad main vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne police ko saunp diya tha
 Ganguly said that he was mistakenly accused
 reporton ke mutabik vishvavidhyalay ke registror ne unke khilaaf chhedchhad kaa maamla darj karaayaa he
 Streaker intrusion on the playground is not new
 strikar aise darshak ko kaha jaataa he, jo apane saare kapade utaar kar maidan main pravesh kar jaataa he or apni chahalkadami se khel ko baadhit karne kii koshish karata he
 Many times during the game, the audience performs such acts due to the passion or fun
 cricket main pehali baar 42 saal pehle aaj hi (4 agast) 1975 main strikar ko dekh log dang rah gaye the, wo bhi cricket ke makka- lords main
 Then the second Test of the Ashes series between England and Australia was going on
 is dauraan pehle strikar ke taur par maaikel angelo, jo marchent navy main cook tha, kaa naam itihaas main darj ho gaya
 Actually, the fourth day of that test match was quite boring
 us vakt england kaa duusari pari main 399 / 6 kaa score tha
 Bob Woolmer and Alan Knot were at the crease, when the 24-year-old raced and jumped over the stumps
 vaise darshak, jo us vakt maidan par chai susti se oongh rahe the, achaanak is ajeeb drishy ko dekhakar hairaan rah gaye
 The striker, who entered from the Lords nursery end, was surrounded by security personnel at the mount stand end
 aakhirkaar magistrate ne us par 10 pound kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 It is interesting that he gained as many pounds when he won the condition of being naked on the field
 maaikel ne chaar saal pehle us ghatana kaa yaad karte hue kaha tha, 'yah match kaaphi ubaau tha
 There was a bit of fun with the Australian audience
 main pi rahaa tha, lekin itnaa bhi nahin
 
 
 , If it had been so, would not have jumped on the stump
 isse zyada mujhe yaad nahin

 shahar kii sadakon kii haalat ko sudhaarney ke makasad se brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika (BMC) ek anuthi yojana laa rahi he
 BMC is planning that if a pit is not filled within 24 hours on the complaint of citizens, then they will be given a cash prize of Rs 500
 BMC ke ek adhikari ne brihaspativaar ko bataaya ki haalanki naagarik jin gaddhon kii shikaayat karte hai ve kam se kam ek foot lambey or teen inch gahare hone chahie
 He said, "to improve the condition of the roads in the city, BMC is planning to give a cash prize to the complainant in such a situation
 agar unki shikaayat par kisi gadde ko karmiyon dwaara 24 ghante ke bheetar nahin bharaa jaataa
 Repair of roads is the responsibility of BMC

 Bhushan alleged that democracy is turning into a dictatorship under the current government and is missing the Emergency imposed in the seventies

 K
 lakshmana ne agar cartoon banaaya hota to ve kya tippanee karte? ve modi ko usee suut main dikhaate or shaayad aisa kuch likhte ki, isamen ankhen gadaakar kuch khojane main vakt jaaya mat karo
 Instead read my lips because what you have seen so far
 bahut din nahin hue jab maine isi stambh main poocha tha ki kya aapane kabhi aisa koi netaa dekha he jo apane mukhute se hu-ba-hu miltaa ho, jaisaa ki modi ke saath he
 Its purpose was not to taunt the old controversy when Govindacharya called Atal Bihari Vajpayee a mask that serves to hide the bjp's reality
 meri manshaa yah jataane kii thi ki vaajapeyi se ulat modi aresas / bijepi kaa sachcha cheharaa hai or kuch bhi anya hone kaa dhong nahin karte
 In the case of Modi, i said that they are what they look like
 isamen kahin koi chhupav yaa paakhand nahin he
 They are like this and will continue to be so in the matter of their choice, whether it is their clothes of choice or their style of fashion
 ho saktaa he ki kapade main unke naam kii silaai kuch zyada jaan padati ho, ise aap anaavashyak ahankaar yaa atmamugdhata kaa naam bhi de sakate hai
 You are free to criticize her choice and style as a fashion writer, but it would be silly to wonder
 unhone ek din main kai baar kapade badalakar ek chalan-sa sthapit kar diya he
 If there is a special occasion or summit, they can also beat the scene of a song from a Tamil film in terms of changing clothes
 unhone apni pasand ke rangon kaa jabardast bhadkila pradarshan kiya he, kabhi-kabhaar to itane chamakdaar rang jo kisi maukey kii upyuktata ke hisaab se hamaari saadagi bhari rajnatik parampara main ajanabi jaan padate hai
 Remember the neon red vest coat that he wore in Bengaluru while celebrating the success of the launch of Mangalyaan with ISRO scientists
 japan ke daure par andarkhaane ye charchaaen thim ki ek din ke bheetar unhone itani baar kapade badale jitani baar hamaari rajdoot ne puri yatra ke dauraan apni sari nahin badali
 This is also true because the ambassador is a gentle public servant and is not expected to do so
 modi khud ko ek jananetaa ke rup main dekhte hai
 They see themselves as a brand that is made for the media - from TV to Twitter, from selfie to Facebook
 isiilie unhen apane brands ko kisi aise paridhaan main lapetane main koi dikkat mahasoos nahin hoti jo us brands ko or zyada bhadkila va pradarshan yogya banaae
 Would there have been only such a thing in his mind that his name-striped suit would only underline the brand Modi? It could also be that within this Gujju body a solid Punjabi dwells as we have in this issue
 It is written in the article
 kuch aisa bhav ki mere paas he to main dikhaaungaa; agar aapako koi dikkat he to jaakar apane dimag kaa ilaaj karavaaen, lekin meraa manovaigyanik vishleshan karne se baj aaen
 Actually, my objection to Modi's discussion about this allegedly unnecessary, arrogant and immature style is also similar
 ham ek baat jaanate hai ki hamaare netaa kabhi garib nahin hote, lekin ham chaahate hai ki ve bechaara dikhen
 No matter how selfish and pessimistic they may be in their politics, no matter how much money they have deposited in their fictional Swiss bank accounts or have been deposited in the form of IOU bills with their real estate friends, but our wishes It is that they are visible to us only in folded Khadi
 main modi ke pahanaave kaa samarthan nahin kar rahaa lekin mere kehane kaa aashay yah he ki is bare main faisle sunaakar ham vaisaa hi moorkhtapurna kaam kar rahe hai, jaisaa ki drawing room or cocktail partiyon main dusron ko prabhavit karne ke liye sasta manovigyaan baghaarne main dikhataa he
 We do not do such things when people like us in the upper class come out wearing self-styled pastel trousers or small black dresses in their self-styled style and are trying to pull it under their puffy belly and fluffy thighs
 un ajeebogareeb lui vitan baigon kii to baat hi mat kariye jo itane mahange lekin itane bure hote hai ki vitan kehane ke bajaae c se shuru hone vaala vah khantee hindustani shabd istemaal karnaa behatar he jise yahaan chapa nahin ja saktaa
 The word sounds good only with the mouth of filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj

 Let us all make a list of the top five political figures whose clothes and lifestyle we consider very bad
 sabase pehle apane motiyon or purse ke saath hameshaa dikhne vaali mayawati, phir aksar deele-dhaale suut main dikhne vaale ambedkar, phir safed wine pine vaale balasaheb or ab apane neon red westcot or apane naamon kii dhari vaala suut pahanane vaale modi
 Now make a list of leaders with good apparel and lifestyle: Vasundhara Raje who is dressed in silk and jewelery, Marhum Jyoti Basu who flirts with inklabs and single malt, Arun Jaitley who wears Kashmiri clothes and Pattek Philippe watches, his Gucci shoes, mon blanc Rajiv Gandhi, famous for spending a pen and a splendid holiday, kept a box of hairdo biscuits with him during a campaign in Chhindwara Glittering Nath Khadi, and even the Recnkarm in one of the most expensive corporate farms Bangalore Anna Hazare too, Goya is not fast enough to lose weight for a Gandhian and catharsis; And finally remember the Lohiaist George Fernandez, whose pen of Lami used to be his identity
 inamen aapako doharaa paakhand najar aayega
 Someone emerges on the sky of politics, we want that dress to be seen in the dress
 hamen isse fark nahin padataa ki usne bheetar lanvin kaa kachha pahana hua he yaa uski car main harrds ke biscuit rakhe hue hai
 Secondly, we draw our conclusions from where are the roots of the said person
 sampannataa ke bich paidaa hua koi nehru yaa gandhi apana aishwarya tyagkar khaadi apana letaa he or isiilie vinamrata or saadagi kii pratimurti ban jaataa he
 What about those people who have started in poverty and now that they have succeeded, they think that they should be able to live a little accordingly? The same thing provokes us and we get up to say - Where did it come from? Here, in an old film Sagina, we remember actor Dilip Kumar where he dances to a song in the role of a rustic Western clad, "sala main Then he became an officer
 
 
 ye suut meraa dekho, ye boot meraa dekho, jaise chhora koi london kaa
 "if we refer to the song of Dilip Kumar, then it becomes a matter that if a balwai lives in his own nappies, we will be happy and if a suit-maker leaves his suit and adopts the diapers, we will be more happy
" yah badalata hua nahin balki ek badal chukaa bharat he
 Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, etc
 were born in such prosperity that a hundred years ago their families had enough money to send them to study abroad
 unhen jo viraasat main mila tha, use tyagkar unhone apni rajnatik style viksit kii
 In the current Lok Sabha, there are such leaders, including Modi, who have come from all other environments
 ve viraasat main kuch lekar nahin aae or ab jabaki unhone kamyaabi kaa swaad chakh liya he, unhen apane aishwarya kaa pradarshan karne main koi hichak nahin hoti
 May be their saints impress us by renouncing inherited opulence
 kisi ke pahanaave-odhaave kii pasand par tippanee karne ke maamle main main khud ko sabase kam yogya paata hum lekin modi ke maamle main main ek baat kii saraahna karata hum ki unke bheetar paakhand nahin he
 i understand this by giving an example
 aap congress netritv kii yuva peedi par ek nigaah daaliye
 Many of these live two lifestyles together
 raat das baje se pehle ve khaadi ke kurte main rahete hai or uske baad silk kii chust kaali tii-shart main avatar le lete hai, kabhi-kabhaar to mahangi dukaati or harley-davidson kii bhi ve sawari karte hai
 i remember once when i went to meet George Fernandes at his residence and i saw that he was neatly folding in his ironed pajamas
 koi samaajawaadee majdoor netaa jo itnaa vinamr ho, itane vyavasthit tareeke se aakhir kaise rah saktaa tha? beshak rah saktaa he
 Remember, he had no problem when an IAS officer on the floor of the Mi-17 chopper was bowing and putting snow boots on his feet while leaving Siachen
 ham ummid kar sakate hai ki aisa paakhand modi kii ore se hamen dekhne ko nahin milegaa, phir unki pasand or style par hamaari raay chaahe kuch bhi ho
 Anyway, we have not chosen them for modesty
 hamen unki 56 inch kii chaati vaali dambhokti pasand thi, unki gujarat kii kamyaabi or vahaan kiye gaye kaamon ko lekar atiranjit bayaanbaji pasand thi
 The most important thing about Modi is that he looks like he is
 bauddhik, rajnatik, vaicharik or darshanik str par ve jawaharlal nehru ke bainks khadey hai
 If you want, you can try it out to test it
 apane shahar main fabindia yaa khaadi bhawan ke kisi outlet main chale jaaie, jahaan dashakon se hamaare desh kaa udaaravaadi samudaay hathkargha ke kurte or 'jawahar' jacket kharidne jaataa rahaa he
 Stay there for a while, you will definitely hear the voice of some customer who is asking for 'modi' jacket
 aap paaenge ki yah vahi jacket he
 Modi has done at least one thing
 ve pahanaave ke maamle main jawaharlal nehru ko takkar dekar unase aage nikal gaye hai
 Union minister and BJP leader Uma Bharti has made a big statement on the Ram temple issue

 In this shock, where atms were emptied in 6 to 7 states and there was a competition to withdraw cash from atms across the country, once again, the statements of the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India showed a glimpse of mutual coordination
 buudhvaar ko jaise hi soshal media main karency crunch kaa kiward trend karne laga aanan fanan main vitt mantralay, rigerv bank, sarkari bank or aarthik salaahkaaron samet kai str se maamle par safai kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 On behalf of the central government, it was clarified to the Finance Ministry that there is no currency crisis
 lekin jin ilaakon main is sankat kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he vahaan jald se jald raahat pahunchane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Read this: Cash Crunch: 500 notes have not been printed since November, now after the clarification of the Ministry of Printing in 3 shifts, the Reserve Bank issued a press release that in about 5 states of the country during 12-13 days Cash crunch crisis has arisen due to unexpected cash withdrawal
 is sankat ke chalate kendriya rigerv bank ne elaan kiya ki usne ek antarraji samiti kaa gathan kar diya he jo cash sankat se grast rajyon ko adhik cash vaale rajyon se karency ke movement ke kaam ko dekhegi
 Read this: Economy not cashless, cash playing spoiled due to the closure of printing, in relation to this conference, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted that there is no currency crisis in the entire country
 sarkaar ke khajaane main paryaapt karency uplabdh he
 There has been a news of currency crisis in selected areas of some states which will be rectified in 2 to 3 days time
 ise padhein: gujarat sarkaar ne RBI ko chetaya tha, hone vaali he cash kii killatavitt mantri ke is twit ke turant baad vitt rajya mantri ne press conference kii
 It was informed in this press conference that the Finance Ministry has formed a committee in five states in view of the currency crisis
 yah samiti in rajyon main karency crunch kii samasya kaa moolyankan karte hue karency sankat ko dur karne ke kaam main madad karegi
 This work will be done on a war footing and according to the statement of the Finance Minister, this crisis will be resolved in 2-3 days time
 ise padhein: cash kii killat se ubarne main lagegaa ek hafte kaa vakt: SBI chairmangauratlab he ki vitt rajya mantri kii is press conference tak kai rajyon main apratyaashit cash nikasi kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya
 The withdrawal came after noon when in an interview to a TV channel, the Economic Adviser to the Finance Ministry claimed that where Rs 20,000 crore of withdrawals are normally made from banking in the country during a month, just the first two of April
 a total of Rs 45,000 crore has been withdrawn during the weeks
 iske chalate kuch rajyon main atm khaali ho gaye hai haalanki daawa kiya gaya ki sarkaar jald se jald sthiti ko saamaanya kar legi
 Read this: The government agreed - some states have a cash crisis, said - will send from the cashier states
 It is a matter of fact that among all these dialogues, one thing was said repeatedly that sufficient amount of currency is available in the government treasury of the country
 iske baavjood buudhvaar dopaher baad centre sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki usne rigerv bank ko jald se jald 500 rupee kii mudra kii printing shuru karne kaa nirdesh de diya he
 The question arises that when sufficient amount of currency was available in the estimation of the government and the central bank till noon, then why was the decree of currency printing given at a fast speed? Is the finance ministry once again in the currency crunch like the demonetization phase? And was there any lack of communication between the Reserve Bank or were both institutions trying to solve the same issue in isolation? If this is so, is not such communication in the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank weakening these institutions to deal with some big and small economic crisis? bahucharchit sant bhayyoo ji maharaj ne mangalvaar dopaher indore main khud ko goli markar khudakushi kar lee

 Today, while Amritanandamayi's devotees are engaged in a digital battle after the e-version of Treadwell's book went viral on social media, the Kerala Police is trying to locate the net users who downloaded and shared the book
 vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke antarrashtriya mahasachiv chanpat raay ne 24 farvari ko tradewell ke aaropon kii jaanch karaane kii maang karte hue kaha, ''kisi ko bhi hindu samaaj ko uksaana nahin chahie

 At this, Amma forbade Gayatri to do so
 ”kerala police ne tradewell kii kitaab ke aarope ke aadhaar par balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karne ke liye kanoonee salaah maangi he
 Police have also been asked to contact Treadwell and conduct a preliminary level investigation after ascertaining the allegations

 inamen tradewell ke aaropon kaa majaak udaaya gaya he or jawaab main tradewell par kaamuk pravriti kaa hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 However, Treadwell is not at all bothered about this

 i have told the truth without any bad feelings and that is why they do not have a proper case against me

 Treadwell also said that initially she wanted to forget all and she also feared that she could be harmed if she made everything public

 She says, "these allegations cannot even touch me

 During this time, Salman Khan's stars were also elevated
 donon ne kai bade sitaron ke saath kaam kiya magar ab tak aisa nahin hua ki donon saath kaam kar paae hon
 Aamir Khan, Sridevi - Aamir Khan and Sridevi have achieved that position in the industry due to which they are counted in the category of best artists
 qayaamat se qayaamat tak main aamir khan hon chahen taare jameen par main or mistar india kii shridevi hon yaa mom main, in sitaron ne apni acting parformens se logon ke dilon main jagah banaai he
 But these stars never appeared on the silver screen together
 vaise donon ke prashansak aisa hote dekh bhi nahin sakenge kyonki lagendary actress shridevi kaa saal 2018 main nidhan ho chukaa he
 If Akshay Kumar, Rani mukerji-akshay Kumar are called Mr
 Players of the industry, then Rani Mukherjee is also counted among the most talented actresses of the industry
 donon ke prashansakon ko besabri se intejaar hoga ki ye jodi on screen bhi saath najar aae
 So far this has not happened
 dekhne vaali baat ye hogi ki kya aane vaale vakt main aisa hoga
 Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan - If Aamir Khan is called Mr
 Perfectionist of the industry, then Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is also perfect in terms of beauty and looks
 donon ke prashansakon ko bahut khushi hoti agar ye sitare kisi film yaa project main saath kaam karte najar aaen
 Fan followings of both are worldwide
 shahrukh khan, aamir khan-bollywood industry main aisa bhi kabhi dekhne ko nahin mila ki teenon khaanon ne saath kaam kiya ho
 Even Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan have not worked together in any film till date
 shahrukh khan or salmaan khan ne to kuch filmon main saath kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan have also worked together
 donon bade sitaron kii takaraar box offis par to hoti hi hogi magar aisa tuk kabhi nahin ban paaya ki king khan or mistar parfectionist kisi film main ek saath najar aae hon
 Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi - If there is talk of two big actresses working together in a film since the 90s in the film industry, then it will also be mentioned whether Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi have worked together
 philhal to jawaab he nahin
 This is not possible even after the death of Sridevi

 There may not be work, but she wants to be seen working on all the issues which may not come under her jurisdiction

 The biggest change in the party's strategy has been with the Jan Lokpal Bill, on which Kejriwal resigned from the government after 49 days
 lekin pichhali baar kii galatiyon se sabak lete hue aap ne is baar janalokapal ko apni praathamikta se baahar kar diya he
 a senior AAP leader says, "this time we are not in a hurry about the Jan Lokpal bill
 ham yah samaj chuke hai ki janata ke maandand alag hai, ham pehle vahi saare kaam kar rahe hai jo logon kii najar main jaruri he
 "actually, aap's strategy is not to confuse the public with technical aspects of contentious issues
 isliye party kii sanchaar ranneeti, “jo janata ko samaj main aata he, vahi baat karo” tak simit he
 a senior party strategist argues that this is the secret of aap's success
 is ranneeti ko aage badhaate hue party postaron or prachaar ke anya madhyamon kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The party reviews its campaign strategy every week and does not hesitate to withdraw any negative publicity material if needed

 They are afraid that the magic that has gone on in Delhi, if the same magic is done in Punjab and other states also, the condition of BJP will worsen
 ” unka kahana he ki police or jameen ke alaava centre sarkaar seva yani transfar-posting main bhi rajya sarkaar ko apane hisaab se kaam nahin karne de rahi

 to kejariwal anya rajyon kii chaabi kyon chaahate hai?”haalanki dabi jabaan aap ke kuch anya netaa maanate hai ki dilli police or jameen kaa adhikaar kabhi rajya sarkaar ko nahin mil saktaa
 But its strategy is to keep it flying so that the state government does not stand in the dock on law and order
 to kya 49 dinon vaali sarkaar chhodane kii vajah se aparipakv kahi jane vaali aap ab raajnneeti kii vyaavhaarikta ko samaj gai he? aap main hui aapasi kalah or farji degree maamle main purv kanoon mantri jitendra singh tomars kaa istipha, vidhayakon par lage gambhir aaropon ne kejariwal sarkaar kii saakh par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Apart from this, the principles of aap's separate politics are also being raised for making mlas parliamentary secretaries
 lekin aap ke netaa yah maanane main gurej nahin karte ki kuch maamalon main usase galati hui he
 The reason for preparing a large army of parliamentary secretaries in the eyes of the opposition may be appeasement, but aap's strategy is to prepare the new plant of politics for the next generation
 lekin takaraav kii is raajnneeti main aap jununee nahin hona chaahati
 Its focus is on the image of about half a dozen top-tier leaders
 aap ke ek netaa kehete hai, “centre sarkaar ham par jitna hamalaa karegi, hamen utana phayda hoga basharte hamase koi badi bhul na ho or kisi par bhrashtachar kaa aarope na lage

 agar aap yah samajhati he ki is raajnneeti se janata uske paksh main he to shaayad ve yah bhul rahe hai ki bijepi ko bhi chunaav main 30 fisadi vot mili the
 "the way AAP has given indirect support to Nitish Kumar in the Bihar elections, it is clear that Kejriwal's eye is to fill the vacancy of the Opposition vacated due to the collapsing of the Congress, for which he constantly ruled the non-congress-non-bjp party
 The Chief Ministers of the states are in touch
 bihar chunaav main bhi kejariwal kii ranneeti nitish ke liye apil kii bajaae narendra modi par sidhaa hamalaa bolne kii he
 After Bihar, Kejriwal will play the biggest claim in Punjab and just like Delhi, if you win the AAP, then Kejriwal's intention of standing at the national level in politics will get wings
 bhale log aap ko kranti or badlaav ke nazariye se dekh rahe hon, lekin ab satta kii vyaavhaarikta se party ko takaraav kii raajnneeti main rashtriya phayda najar aa rahaa he

 No, 1997

 We have been together for so long
 sushils yaar, mujhe bilkul yaad nahin
 We were small children
 ham bhai to nahin, magar kisi bhi myne main sage bhaaiyon se kam bhi nahin hai
 We have seen each other's successes and failures together and overcome them
 ham jai or viru se bhi zyada gahare dost hai
 Then you will also have all the lovely memories of growing up together and clashing together? Sushilakya - What didn't we do together

 Known for wrestling, how many times have you traveled to Rohtak by sitting in local buses
 ek dfa america main ek toornament ke dauraan maine haanfate hue yogeshwar se kaha, ‘‘bhai, aaj to shaayad jaan hi nikal jaaegi

 This fellow has always put me ahead of himself

 Moreover, our habits are also similar
 aap kah sakate hai ki ham ek-duusare kii carbon-copy hai
 Two sides of the same coin
 2008 beijing olympic ek apwaad tha jahaan susheel jeeta magar main nahin jeet paaya
 But in London, the train was back on track again
 beijing main sabko yogeshwar se padak jeetne kii ummid thi
 But Sushil won the medal
 sushils pucho to is baat kaa mujhe gaharaa afsos tha
 Yogeshwar was in a good pool but luck was bad
 jab main usase mila to vah meri kamyaabi par bahut khush tha or mujhe bhi acha laga ki chalo, kam-se-kam is baat se to use khushi mili
 Yogeshwara, i was disappointed with myself but i was happy for Sushil to win
 uske padak ne ek khel ke rup main kushti ko or khaas taur par pahalawaanon ko dekhne kaa bharat kaa najariya hi badal diya
 He earned respect for the entire fraternity of wrestlers
 usne akele dam par is khel cheharaa hi badal diya
 Susheel: i cannot take all the credit for this
 mere liye bahut-se log parade ke peeche rahakar kaam karte rahe hai
 But i believe that much has changed since Beijing
 or landan main jahaan ham donon ne ek-ek padak jeeta, uske baad to kushti ne bhartiya logon ke dimag main ek bilkul alag hi jagah bana lee
 Now we have many names winning tournaments abroad and they are at the top in their respective categories
 aksar log kehete hai ki ‘‘pahalwaan he to dimag kam hoga
 "how do you react to such a stitch? Sushilaji, wrestling requires more brains than strength

 westeindies cricket team ke purv captain kris gail ko indian premier lig (ipel) kii frenchiji tiimon ne janvari main hui nilaamee main 'kharidne' se inkaar kar diya tha lekin sthanapann ke taur par ipel-4 main laute gail ne shatak lagaakar jataa diya ki frenchiji tiimon kaa faisla kitna galat tha
 Interestingly, on January 10, when the auction was going on in Bengaluru for the current season of IPL and Gayle as well as former captain of the Indian team Sourav Ganguly was not getting any buyers, Gayle was in the Big Bash tournament in Australia Playing a stormy innings of 137 runs
 yah bhi ajeeb sanyog he ki jis kolkata nite rides ne ipel ke duusare sanskaran main gail se captaini karai thi, usee ne chauthe sanskaran ke liye unhen apnaane se inkaar kar diya
 Look at the fortunes of the Knight Riders as Gayle scored a brilliant century against him while playing at the Eden Gardens for Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday and became the hero of his team
 match ke baad pavilion lautate vakt gail ke chehre par is shandaar pradarshan kii khushi saaf dekhi ja sakati thi
 While shaking hands with his colleagues, he said, "what a debut (what a great start
" " ipel ke liye gail kaa naam nayaa nahin he lekin darkinar kiye jane ke baad gail ne jis andaaj main ipel main vaapasi kii he, use sahi myne main debyue (nai shuruyaat) hi mana ja saktaa he
 Actually, given the stature and style of Gayle, he cannot be ignored for any form of cricket
 gail ke alaava newjiland ke brendan maiklam, bharat ke virendra sahvaag or yusuf pathan, pakistan ke shahid afridi, dakshin africa ke abraham divilliars or australia ke adam gilcrist sthapit match jitau khilaadi rahe hai or aise khilaadiyon ko nazarandaaj karnaa savartha galat faisla qaraar diya jayega
 Afridi is not playing in the IPL
 unke alaava maiklam, pathan, sahvaag, divilliars or gilcrist ko sammanit kharidaar mili lekin kisi bhi team ne gail ko apane saath jodne kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 Gayle was then dropped from the West Indies national team
 sabhi tiimon ko unki aadhaar keemat 400,000 dollar kaaphi zyada lagi
 Gayle, who had refused the West Indies Cricket Board's central agreement, had no choice but to return to an event like big-bash or IPL
 australia ke tej gendbaaj dark nains ke sthanapann ke taur par gail ko apane saath jodne vaale royal chalangers ke maalik vijay maalya ne sabit kiya ki vah itane safal vyavsaayee kyon hai
 Mallya himself had refused to adopt Gayle in January, but as time went on and the way for the central contract of Caribbean cricket was cleared, Mallya felt that keeping Gayle in the team could prove useful as he was being charged by Sri Lankan players
 Like there will be no pressure to return home
 vah puure samarpan se unki team ke liye khel sakate hai
 Meanwhile, Nains had a back injury and the team management demanded that Gayle be included in the team without delay
 iske liye use nains ke baraabar raashi kharch kerani thi

 With this, the target starts firing at the target
 lekin goliyon kaa koi khaas asar nahin hota
 He moves rapidly towards the Kurdish camp

 tab bharat main is beemaari ke liye uttam chikitsa vyastha uplabdh na thi
 Because of which Vajpayee had to go to America for treatment, but due to economic reasons, Vajpayee was not able to go to America
 atal bihari vaajapeyine bhavuk andaaj main bataaya ki kisi tarah rajeev gandhi ko yah baat maaloom padi ki ve kidney sambandhi beemaari se peedit hai or unhe videsh main ilaaj kii aavashyaktaa he
 Vajpayee said that one day Rajiv Gandhi called him to his office and said that he was being sent to the United Nations with a delegation from India
 rajeev gandhi ne vaajapeyi se kaha ki unhen ummid he ki is maukey kaa laabh lete hue ve neuyork main apana ilaaj bhi karvaa lenge
 Vajpayee said that he went to New York and that is why he is alive today
 neuyork se lautne ke baad yah vakya na rajeev gandhi or na hi vaajapeyi ne kisi se saajha kiya
 Both personalities played opposing roles in public life
 haalanki atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kuch samay baad ek postcard ke jariye sandesh bhejkar rajeev gandhi ko is shishtataa ke liye dhanyavad preshit kiya
 But Rajiv's Jeet Ji did not share this incident with anyone else
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or rajeev gandhi aaj kii raajnneeti kaa hissaa nahin hai or na hi aaj wo daur he
 Such bravado for its opponents is rare in today's ruthless politics
