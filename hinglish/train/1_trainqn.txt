 Masood Azhar sent his terrorists to spread hatred in the valley

 Masood Azhar then gave this responsibility one by one to his dozens of commanders
 wo oparation olout ke tahat maare gaye
 Furious Masood Azhar then sent his nephew as commander in the valley

 When the water rose above the head, Masood sent his nephew
 uskaa bhi vahi hashr hua
 Overall, the Indian Army has wreaked havoc on the enemies of the country in the last two years so that the entire clan of terror has shrunk
 oparation aal out ke tahat dhai sau se zyaada aatankiyon ko jahannam bhejkar aatanki mansoobon kii qamar tod di gai
 Alam is now that the remaining terrorists are in such awe that they are taking voluntary retirements so that they do not have to cross the border where the gunfire of the Indian Army is waiting for them
 main power kii kami jujh rahe jaish ke taqariban sabhi bade aatankiyon ko suraksha balon ne jammu-kashmir main dher kar diya he
 So Masood Azhar has driven his most trusted commander out of the den to rebuild Jaish in the valley and avenge the deaths of his nephew and other terrorists
 sena ne shuru kiya oparation gajijaish ke saikadon aatankiyon or parivaar ke logon kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye jaish sargana masood azhar buree tarah se baukhalaayaa hua he or isi baukhalaahat main wo ek ke ek baad galati karata ja rahaa he

 Dropped
 lihaaza ab jaish ke sargana masood azhar ne kashmir ke liye banaaya he 'gaji plan'
 Know who is Ghazi, first of all, know who is this Abdul Rashid Ghazi
 jaankaree ke mutabik gaji masood azhar kaa sabase bharosemand saathi he
 
 jo hathiyaaron or visphotakon khaas taur par iidi kaa export he
 Ghazi is believed to have been involved in carrying out terrorist activities in Afghanistan

 adaalat ne kaha ki vah apane sanghatan or nyayasima par guuruuvaar ko faisla sunayegi
 The defense counsel appealed to the court to stop the hearing for five weeks, but the court turned it down

 ' hamamen se bahut se log aise hai jo sona to bahut chaahate hai lekin chaiyn kii neend so nahin pate hai
 On the one hand, due to lack of good sleep, irritability starts and there is also a decrease in energy
 kai baar iske liye hamaari kuch ajeebogareeb harakatein bhi jimmedaar hoti hai
 If you also do some such activities in the midnight, then there is still time to be careful before your lifestyle takes away everything from you
 agar aap ye puuchhen ki raat ko healdi kya karnaa chahie to iskaa ek sidhaa sa jawaab he ki sirf sona
 How well you are sleeping at night, it affects your whole day
 par agar aap madhyaraatri main ye kaam karte hai to sanbhal jaaie:1
 Cigarettes have a very profound effect on pinnicotine
 nicotine lene ke kai ghanton tak aap jage hi rah jate hai
 Due to this, both your mind and body do not get rest
 bich raat main cigarette pine se neend kii prakriya par bura prabhaav padataa he
 2
 sharaab pinaagar aap madhyaraatri main sharaab pite hai to aapaki subah bilkul bhi acchhee nahin hogi
 The higher the quantity you take, the worse your morning will be
 3
 Caffeine intake: It is not right to take caffeine in any form at night or at midnight
 agar aap aadhi raat ko caffeine le rahe hai to iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki aapane apni neend ko kuch ghanton ke liye taal diya he
 We all have a sleeping cycle which is very important to keep fixed
 4
 In the middle of the night, sweet snacks should be tried during the dinner, do not eat sweet snacks
 aisa karne se hamaare sharir main calories kii ek bahut badi maatra to jaati he lekin uskaa koi dohan nahin ho paata he
 In such a situation, the possibility of weight gain increases greatly
 5
 Too much spicy food should be avoided during the night or in the middle of the night
 aisa karne se gas kii samasya ho jaati he or pet se judi pareshaaniyon kii vajah se neend main vyavdhaan aa jaataa he
 6
 tivi dekhnader raat tak tivi dekhnaa swasthya ke lihaaj se bahut hi galat he
 While changing the channel, it is no longer remembered that time is passing
 isse ankhon par to atirikt dabaav padataa hi he saath hi dimag ko bhi aaraam nahin mil paata he

 kaam karnaa or uske bare main sochnader raat tak jagana or offis ke kaam ko ghar par niptaana yaa phir kaam ke bare main hi sochate rahanaa bhi neend kharaab karata he

 tension itnaa haseen he ki aap hairat main pad jaaenge
 Salman Khan is worried why his domineering Hasina is not losing weight? Now you will say that this is not new, Salman is worried about his heroin, but how much weight is there in this tension Is something to see aajkal salmaan khan apnirajjoko har vakt takate rahete hai
 Dabangg Salman has a sharp look at Sonakshi every time
 kabhi is hasina ko dekhakar dabang ke dil kii dhadkan bad jaati thi, lekin ab inke badhate vazan se bad rahi he salmaan kii tension
 Even when Salman launched Sonakshi Sinha in Dabangg, Sonakshi weighed more than the rest of the glamorous heroines, but Salman worked very hard on her weight even then
 lekin ab kii baat or he, ab salmaan ko lagata he ki sonakshi apni kamyaabi ke baad apane vazan ko nazarandaaz kar rahi hai
 Salman was shocked when he saw Sonakshi on Rowdy Rathore's promotion
 suna he roudi lathore ke promos ko dekhakar salmaan kaa tension or bad gaya he, kyonki salmaan ke anusaar sonakshi kaa vazan bilkul kam nahin hua he
 Actually Salman is very excited about Dabangg 2
 is film ke luk par wo khud baariki se nazar rakhe hue hai
 In such a situation, he is worried about the rising weight of his heroin Sonakshi
 salmaan ko lagata he ki sonakshi ko glamer kii daud main bane rahane ke liye apane vazan ko nazarandaaz nahin karnaa chahie
 Salman says, "sonakshi has to control her weight to stay in this industry, eat and drink is like brother but i always tell her to lose weight
 ’ab ye to sabhi jaanate hai ki is ladi dabang ko kisi se dar nahin lagata
 Just think of Salman
 lekin is baar sonakshi lagata he salmaan kii baat sunne ke mood main nahin hai
 Perhaps she is fed up with dieting, or she is confident of her success
 vaise sawaal ye he ki salmaan sonakshi ko slim banane par kyon tule hai, aakhir har hasina saise zero ho ye zaruri to nahin
 Sonakshi and Vidya Balan have made their place with their strength, their own strength and their weight
 to salmaan tension nahin lene kaa

 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne congress or rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or kaha he ki ab congress indira se congress italy ho gai he
 While addressing public meetings in Shahdol, Satna and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, on Wednesday, Modi attacked the Congress and the Prime Minister fiercely
 unhone jabalpur kii jansabha main kaha ki congress kii pahchaan ab karpshan (bhrashtachar) ban gai he
 The situation in the country is that the entire ABCD is made by scams
 unhone aage kaha ki vikaas se chhattis kaa aankada rakhane vaali congress ke khilaaf janata main gussa he or vah use sajaa sunaane ke mood main he
 BJP is in the air in the country and will win the assembly elections of the four states
 modi ne kaha ki beete 50 varshon ne itane gadde kiye the ki unhen bharne main hi das saal lag gaye, madhya pradesh main bijepi or shivaraj ko paanch saal or dijie phir vikaas dekhie
 There will be such development that it will be discussed everywhere
 gujarat se bhi madhya pradesh aage nikal jayega
 Earlier, while addressing an election rally in Shahdol, Modi lashed out at the Congress
 modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki congress aazaadee se aaj tak sirf vaade karti aa rahi he, tathaa satta main aate hi vah saare vaade tod detii he
 Modi said that the Congress shakes one hand before it in power, and after coming to power starts looting with both hands
 modi rajya vidhansabha chunaav main sthaneey bijepi ummidavaaron ke samarthan main prachaar karne aae the
 Modi said in Shahdol's public meeting that there is a government in Delhi under whose rule the poor are fed, the dreams of youth are lost and the dignity of daughters and daughters is not saved
 modi ne kaha, 'congress ne aazaadee ke baad vaade or naare die, lekin satta main aane par sabhi vaadon ko tod diya
 In the election, the Congress showed one hand and after reaching power, started looting with both hands
 desh main manhagaai or bhrashtachar kaa jo alam he uske liye congress jimmedaar he
 The public will no longer give the Congress a chance to loot and break ties
 'modi ne congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi dwaara madhya pradesh pravaas ke dauraan die gaye us bayaan par bhi chutki lee jisame unhone kaha tha ki adivasee parivaar kaa baccha bhi vimaan main udana chahta he
 Modi said, 'shahzade was saying that the tribal youth wants to fly in the plane
 congress 50 varshon se desh chalaa rahi he, agar unke liye vigyaan kii kakshaen hi chalaa di hotin to adivasee ke noujvaan vimaan main baithne kii nahin sochataa balki banaakar chalaata
 'modi further said,' After independence, the Congress took news of the tribals, Dalits and the backward at every election, but did nothing for their well being on the ground after coming to power
 atalbihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main pehali baar jab bijepi ke netritv main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) sarkaar bani, tab adivaasiyon ke liye desh main pruthak mantralay banaaya gaya, adivasee mantri tainaat kiya gaya or adivaasiyon ke kalyaan ke liye pruthak se bajet kii vyavastha kii gai
 Modi further said that if the Congress had done this system immediately after independence, then tribal areas would not be backward
 ' modi ne pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii kaaryastylee kii saraahna karte hue kaha ki unhone har varg ke hit kii yojanaayen chalaai hai, vahiin congress vah dal he jo garibon kaa majaak uda rahi he
 Claiming that there is a storm in the country in support of BJP, Modi said, 'places for BJP rallies and public meetings are proving small in the country
 bijepi ne dabe kuchlon, adivaasiyon kii karaah ko suna he or samvednaa vyakt kii he
 If the groan of the tribals had reached the deaf ears of the Congress in the last 50 years, the view of the country would have been different
 'modi ne shivaraj sarkaar ke kaaryon kii jamkar saraahna kii
 Modi said, 'the Chief Minister has made arrangements to give one rupee a kg wheat, two rupees rice under the Annapurna Yojana, Antyodaya Yojana to the poor
 adivasee sammaan kii jindagi guzar-basar karata he
 He does not eat free food, so the state government has given cheaper ration
 congress kahati he ki vah satta main aane ke baad 35 kilo anaaj muft main garibon ko degi
 Congress promise is false, electoral trader
 yadi congress kii yah patibaddhta he to use is yojana ko maharashtra, karnataka, adhrapradesh or haryana main lagu karke dikhaanaa chahie
 It is the job of Congress to make false promises during elections

 This time Chhath Puja is also very important because this year only Delhi assembly elections are held

 Prakash Javadekar said, 'today in the Rajya Sabha, the Chairman himself gave Amit Shah a chance to speak
 iske baavjood unako na bolne dena puri tarah galat he
 We strongly condemn this
 'kendriya mantri ne kaha ki sabhapati ne enarasi par amit shah ko apana bhaashan puraa karne ke liye bulaayaa tha, kyonki mangalvaar ko vyavdhaan ke chalate unka bhaashan aadha hua tha
 However, before this, Congress leader Anand Sharma objected that Amit Shah had said on Tuesday that since 1985, no one had the courage to implement NRC till now
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki vipaksh yah pehle se hi tay karke aayaa tha ki aaj sadan nahin chalane dena he
 It is a murder of democracy
 unhone kaha kirajyasabha main bijepi adhyaksh amit shaahako bolne se rokna or kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ko na sunanaa vipaksh kii ek sajeesh he
 Javadekar said that today the opposition had already decided that Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh should not be allowed to speak in the Rajya Sabha
 congress or trinmul congress sadan ko chalane nahin dena chaahate hai
 After all, why are Congress and TMC Prakash Javadekar running away from the discussion, what is the fear of Congress and TMC, who are running away from the discussion? Who do they want to save, because Rajiv Gandhi had signed the Assam Accord, whose soul is NRC
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki ghuspaithiyon ko yahaan se nikaalnaa he or indira gandhi khud chaahati thim ki bangladeshiyon ko waapas bangladesh bheja jaae, lekin aaj congress kaa stand kya he? kya ab congress kaa stand badal gaya he? congress ko is par apana stand saaf karnaa chahie
 Clean your stand on infiltration Sonia Gandhi: bjpprakash Javadekar questioned UPA President Sonia Gandhi that she should clean her stand on infiltration, because Mamata Banerjee is also going to meet him
 mamata banerjee kaa stand to saaf he ki wo ghuspaithiyon ko bachaana chaahati hai or yahaan rakhana chaahati hai, lekin sonia gandhi ko bataanaa chahie ki wo kya chaahati hai?bijepi adhyaksh shah nahin, balki tiemasi nervasah jaavdekar11 agast ko kolkata main amit shah kii raily se jude sawaal par prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki amit shah nervas nahin he, balki tiemasi nervas he
 The way the BJP is getting tremendous support in Bengal, the Trinamool Congress is scared
 trinmul congress ke communist shatru nahin hai, balki bijepi unako shatru lagati he
 On the question of allowing the rally, he said that the Mamta government has not done any favor by allowing the rally
 vahaan kii sarkaar ko kaarykram karne dena chahie, kyonki sabhi ko raily karne kaa adhikaar he
 You must have heard about surrogate mother's womb, but this news is completely different
 yahaan aasaan paise ke liye jawan ladkiyaan bech rahi hai apane andanu yani eigs
 The donor gets thousands in this business run under the auspices of fertility clinics, while these clinics charge millions from unruly couples
 dilli kii yuva ladakiyon ke ek varg main branded genes yaa julri kaa craij nahin balki jald paise ke liye khatarnaak trend pair pasaar rahaa he, hakeekat aapke hosh uda degi, ladkiyaan apane eigs yani andanu bech rahi hai taaki iji mani kama saken
 There has been an increase in the number of couples who are longing for children, and they are willing to pay any price, as a result this business of eggs is fast growing, but here too the business has its own rate list, you want a beautiful and brainy child
 If you have to pay more for it
 yah keemat pachchis se 75 hajaar ke bich kuch bhi ho sakati he
 Fertility specialist, Dr
 Anoop Gupta, reported that egg donors up to 18 years old approach clinics to donate their eggs for quick pocket money
 fertility clinics ke paas rojaanaa ausatan 10-15 beaulad dampattiyon approach karti hai
 Perhaps there is increasing pressure that such clinics are looking for egg donors and it is due to this that a section of young girls have chosen this path for easy money, without thinking how right or how wrong this step is
 kanoon kii khamiyaan in clinics ke liye vardaan ban gai hai
 They do not tell young girls about the danger of egg donation indiscriminately, and girls also find it an easy way to pocket money, while egg donation is a process that requires hormonal hormones to be delivered to the girl's uterus
 Get Eggs Fast
 iskaa fori asar michali, chakkar or sirdard ke rup main dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 These symptoms persist even after egg donation
 vaise bhi regular egg donneton main jokhim kaaphi zyada he, isse ladakiyon kii overi main beemaari kaa khatra bad zyada he jiske aage chalakar zyada gambhir nattejey ho sakate hai
 Not only the donor, it is not easy for the unruly couple, they do not know anything, and often the clinics also fool them
 aise clinics ko regulate karne ke liye isiemr ne guidelins jari kiye hai, lekin inkaa dhadlle se ulanghan hota he
 This is the reason that now it is time to enact stringent laws
 lekin jabatak kanoon nahin ban jaataa tabatak fertility clinics shaayad isi tarah beaulad dampattiyon kii chahat or yuva ladakiyon kii aasaan paise kii lalak ko bhunaate rahen

 According to Finance Ministry sources, the central government is estimating that the inflation rate will be around the fixed 4 per cent figure, so the central bank should cut the effective interest rates

 Also read: Good days of ending crude oil prices, don't let the government cry, the Daily Pricing Formula is also in a hurry because the Finance Ministry is in a hurry because it is afraid that the rise in the prices of crude oil in the international market in the country Inflation may increase and in such a situation it will be difficult for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates

 For 5 years, the central government has failed to accelerate the economy and will not fail to fulfill its promise of creating millions of jobs in the country if major cuts in interest rates are not announced soon to increase economic activity

 Therefore, the central government has only one option left to announce a major cut in the interest rates as soon as possible and clear the way for investment from the private sector to speed up the country's economy

 british kaal kii chhap liye is shahar main ek nadi saura bahati thi
 The river still flows, but is getting sick
 bahut biimaar
 Akhilesh Chandra's Muta Bik , who campaigned to save the rivers in Purnia, was like the Thames of London, which passed through the city of Purnia, has dried up completely and now the city is dumped Used to be
 akhilesh apni ek report main likhte hai, kabhi 'purainiyaan' main ek saumy nadi bahati thi saura
 Like Kosi, its hair was not scattered on normal days
 jo 'jet' kabhi apni 'jatin' ko mangatikka dene kaa vaada kar 'pus-bhar purainiyaan' aate the, unhen yah kamala nadi kii tarah dikhti thi
 Jatin used to plead when the puranis themselves came to save their womb, "O Saura Mai, kani haul bahao
 
 
 nankirba bemaar chhi
 
 
 There was no objection to meeting Jat
 
 
 (he saura maai, aahiste bahie
 The child is ill
 jet se mulaakaat kii sakht jarurat he)
 
 
 And the river Saura used to be calm with sorrow
 apane lekh main akhilesh saura ko 'jabbar nadi' kehete hai
 Jabbar was such that it never dried up
 par badalte vakt ne, badalati jaruraton, inasaani laalach or aadaton ne ise dublaa bana diya he
 The river's grain-water has stopped
 log saans thame ise marate dekh rahe hai
 Akhilesh writes, Our compulsion is such that we cannot even sing the mourning! In fact, an irony of the changing India is that all the symbols which we have given to the status of the mother have been degraded
 chaahe ghar kii budhi maa ho yaa ganga, gaay or haa, purniya kii saura nadi bhi
 In other words, we can give the status of mother to the symbols that we have to be degraded
 chandra likhte hai ki purniya shahar ko do hisson main baantne vaali saura nadi ko saurya samskruti kii samvahak he
 But for the last few years, the businessmen of this land got black eye
 natijatan, anwarat kal-kal bahane vaali nadi kii jagah par kancreet ke jangal fail gaye hai
 There was a time when hundreds of streams used to come in the Purnia and surrounding areas in the Saura river and give strength to its flow, but now such streams are counted
 in dhaaraon ke pete main jagah-jagah pakke ke makaan khadey kar die gaye
 As a result, the width of Saura is decreasing
 haalanki saura behad saumy-si dikhne vaali nadi he, par iskaa bahut saanskrithik mahatv he
 Research is still being done about its nomenclature
 lekin, yah mana jaataa he ki surya se saurya or saurya se saura hua, jiskaa taratamya jile ke purvi antim hisse se sate surjapur pargana se judaa rahaa he
 Surjapur, a town between purnia-kishanganj, is known as pargana
 bysi-amaur ke ilaake ko choota hua iskaa hissaa arriya seemaa main pravesh karata he
 This area is considered to be the Mahabharata period, where the mention of the huge Sun Temple is mentioned
 puraatatv vibhaag kii ek report main bhi saurya samskruti ke itihaas kii pushti he
 By the way, this is the river where even today, on the occasion of Chhath Mahaparva, there is a big gathering of people who offer argh
 arriya jile ke gidhwaas ke sameep se saura nadi apana aakaar lenaa shuru karti he
 From there it emerges in the form of a thin stream and runs in the same form for about 10 kilometers
 srinagar-jalalgarh kaa chirkutighat, banaili-gadhbanaili kaa dhankhania ghat or kasaba-purniya kaa gerua ghat hote hue saura jab baahar nikalati he, to iskaa aakaar vyapak ho jaataa he or purniya ke captanpul aate-aate iskaa bada swaroop dikhne lagata he
 This river goes further and joins Kosi
 ek samay tha, jab saura is ilaake main sinchai kaa shashakt madhyam thi
 However, in the changing times, not only its existence is seen as a crisis, but its importance is also becoming extinct
 nadi ke aasapaas ke hisse par aaj kancreet ke jangal khadey ho gaye hai
 In Purnia all the link channels of the Saura river water were closed
 angrejon ke samay saura nadi kaa pani nikalne ke liye line bazaar chowk se captain pul ke bich chaar pul banaae gaye the
 Excess water of Saura used to flow from the top and the bottom from the rainy season
 aaj pul yathaavat he, par uske neeche jahaan nadi kii dhara bahati thi, vahaan imaaraten khadi hai
 Here the size of the original river has also become quite small
 nadi ke kinare se shahar sat gaya he
 However, now on social media, Purnia residents have become active to save Saura
 fasebuk par saura nadi bachaao abhiyaan naam kaa ek pej banaaya gaya he or purniya shahar ke naam par bane pej par bhi lagaataar saura ke bare main likhaa ja rahaa he
 With the help of local newspapers, campaigns related to Saura are being continuously written and awareness is also being spread
 par asli masalaa to bhu-mafia ke changul se saura ko nikaalnaa he
 And an even greater defect leads to the basic greedy tendency of all of us to occupy an inch and land
 saura ko sanjivani denevaali dhaaraon ke munh band kiye ja rahe hai
 It seems that the next generation will remember Saura as 'saraswati' and will seek its existence
 dukh he ki purniya kii saura nadi agali saraswati ban rahi he

 Karan Kapadia also gets a bit emotional while saying, 'I wish my mother was with me today to see all this
 ' kai filmon main behtareen abhinay karne vaali or castum digining ke liye neshnal film award paane vaali simple kapaadiya kaa nidhan cancer se 2009 main ho gaya tha tab karan 15 saal ke the
 After his mother's passing, Karan started living with his aunt Dimple Kapadia
 ve unhen apni duusari maa maanate hai
 This is the reason why Karan, who started his acting career with Blanc, has left no stone unturned to promote not only Dimple but also Twinkle Khanna and Akshay Kumar
 akshay ne blank ke pramotion ke liye ali ali ek gaanaa bhi kiya he
 But Karan clarifies, 'I have achieved this film on my own
 isamen meri galati nahin he ki mere relative filmi hai or wo mujhe pramot kar rahe hai
 'akshay has advised Karan as a mantra,' No work is small or big
 jo kaam miltaa he use karo or apana best do
 Work hard and keep your head down
 ' karan kehete hai ki yah salaah jivan ke har kshetra main upyogi he
 And i am trying to give my best

 'I am a suicide bomber in this

 He has a bomb in his chest that moves with a heartbeat

 He tries to catch ATS Chief Sunny Deol
 ' karan aage kehete hai ki isaki kahani bahut hi anokhi he or yah kahani ek din kii he
 It also has terrorism
 lekin kisi desh par aarope nahin lagaaya gaya he
 It is a thriller and entertainment film
 bakaul karan, 'unic kahani kii vajah se maine yah film 10 minute main sin kar lee
 It is true that i was hungry for work
 baavjood iske maine kariyar shuru karne ke liye ek acchhee film kaa chayan kiya
 Karan does not consider himself a math agent
 ve acchhee kahani or achche kairactor vaali filmein karnaa chaahate hai
 The director and writer of Blanc, Bahajad Khambata, is no stranger to Karan, who has worked as an assistant to many directors since the age of 15
 akshay kumaar kii bos film main donon assistant diarector the
 Blank is the first film as a director for Bahjad, who worked as an associate director in Sister Hogi Teri and Azhar films
 bahzad bhi kehete hai ki karan ke saath-saath sani deol bhi unki pehali pasand the
 Karan, who is tired of taking acting training and auditioning from Jeff Goldberg Studios, now believes that he does not trust such training
 kyonki aapke andar kaa kalakaar jab tak baahar nahin aata he tab tak aap apane abhinay se kirdaar ko jeevant nahin bana paaenge
 Because of his connection with the Star Gharana, he says, 'nepotism does not matter
 aapkaa kaam acha he to log aapako pasand karenge
 As of today, no one says that Ranbir is the son of Chintu Saheb
 aapkaa kaam hi aapke liye baat karegaa
 "I have seen Sunny since childhood because my mother used to be a costume designer in her films," says Karan, who is tall, simple-faced and gentle
 main apni maa ke saath set par jaataa tha
 But the first day on the set of Blanc was a nervous day for me
 unhone mujhe kaam main sahaj rahane kii salaah di
 Due to being busy with his first film, Karan could not see the interview of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which Akshay had taken
 karan ab apana bhavishya dekh rahe hai
 Along with films, they are also ready to do web series
 unka kahana he ki web siries main actor ke liye bhi kaaphi aazaadee he
 Encouraged by his first film Blanc, Karan now says that he will sign a film for which he will get good money

 betwa nadi ko bundelkhand kii ganga kaha jaataa he
 Farming, drinking, industry, business, everything depends on Betwa here
 betwa nahin to kuch nahin
 Its importance can be understood that in order to get Bundelkhand out of the drought, the rivers Ken and Betwa are being added to the river linking project
 yaa kam se kam yah maan lenaa chahie ki sarkaar kii sadichha donon nadiyon ko jodne kii he
 But, if you ever walk 25 kilometers from Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi district headquarters on Kanpur highway and go to village Richhaura and Parichha, situated between Parichha Thermal Power Plant and Betwa River, then you will know how much the value of development itself and living along the river People are paying
 in gaanvon main aapako ek bhi maveshi dikhaai nahin padegaa
 Amar Singh Ahirwar, 30, of Richhaura village bought two cows five years ago
 par kuch hi din baad unki gaayen biimaar rahane lageen
 Doctors came to know that ashes are accumulating in the stomach of cows by drinking polluted water of Betwa River
 kuch hi dinon main amar kii donon gaayen chal bases
 The last of the three goats that Amar Singh had received under the Bundelkhand package, died last week
 betwa nadi ke kinare faili raakh ko dikhaate hue amar singh bataate hai ki power plant lagane se gaanv main bijli to mili lekin plant kii raakh ne betwa nadi kii saansen chin lee hai
 As one approaches the Paricha power plant on the jhansi-kanpur highway, the roads leading to the thermal plant appear ashes
 makaanon kii chhaton par raakh kaa samrajya he
 The recent rains have provided some relief
 chhaton par jami koyale kii raakh ko barish kaa pani baha to le gaya par isane gaanv ke kinare bah rahi betwa ko or "vishaiylla'' karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 This ash has made the lives of people hellish in the areas around the power stations
 parichha thermal power plant ke thik peeche sthit richora or parichha gaanvon main pasra sannata alag kissa bataata he
 More than half the people have migrated from these villages with a population of more than ten thousand 30 years ago
 pani ke liye taras rahe bundelkhand main nadi kaa pani hi jaharila ho jaae to inke kinare based gaanvon kii haalat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The Parichha Thermal Power Plant, which started functioning in the year 1984, now has six units consuming 16,000 metric tonnes of coal daily and 14,000 metric tonnes of wet ash daily which is sent to the dam
 parichha thermal power plant ke ek adhikari bataate hai, "210 megawatt kshamta vaali ikaayiyon se nikalne vaali raakh ke liye bane donon dam bhar chuke hai jabaki 110 megawatt kshamta vaali ikaayiyon ke liye bane dam kaa ek kampartment bhar chukaa he
 Now the ash is being dumped in another compartment
 isamen bhi chah maheene tak hi raakh rakhane kii vyavastha he
 "poisoned water from the ash being mixed in Betwa has killed more than 50 domesticated animals in Paricha and Richhaura villages in the last two years
 parichha gaanv ke jagadish parihaar bataate hai, "betwa main chemical vaali raakh milane kaa asar gaanv ke handpampon par bhi padaa he
 Now these hand pumps also provide polluted water
 '' richora gaanv ke pradhan kuldeep singh bataate hai, "betwa nadi kii talahati main 20 se 25 foot tak raakh jamaa ho jane se nadi chhichhli ho gai he
 When a little water increases, it reaches the village
 ''nadi par bana parichha baandh bhi chhichhlaa ho gaya he
 Srischand, an engineer posted at the irrigation department in Jhansi, says, "the storage of ash in the foothills of the dam has reduced its storage capacity considerably, which can cause irrigation crisis in the coming days
" '' parichha bijlighar kii raakh ko thikaane lagane ke liye ek nayaa aish dam banane kii bhi yojana he
 For this, 572 acres of land in the village adjacent to the plant, Maheba, Gulara and Murata were to be acquired

 There has been a long debate in the country about holding Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 The Election Commission, Niti Aayog, Law Commission and Constitution Review Commission have discussed this matter
 kuch hi raajnneetik partiyaan iske paksh main hai
 Most political parties have opposed it
 ye to tay he ki jab tak is par sahmati nahin banati, ise dharaatal par utaarna mushkil hoga
 However, elections to panchayats and municipalities are not included
 ek desh ek chunaav kii jarurat he yaa nahin?loktantr kii pehali seedhi hi chunaav he
 But once in a big country like India, conducting a clean and fair election is a big challenge
 desh main ausatan har saal kisi na kisi rajya main chunaav hota rahata he
 The country is always on election mode due to frequent elections
 is vajah se prashasnic or nitigat faisle prabhavit hote hai
 At the same time, the country also faces a huge economic burden
 ise rokane ke liye loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ek saath karaane kaa vichaar laayaa gaya he
 There have been four times in the country before, elections together
 One country is not an election
 saal 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967 main ekasaath loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaav ho chuke hai
 But this trend was broken in 1968-69 when the assemblies of some states were dissolved ahead of time
 haalanki, kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki desh kii aabaadi bahut zyada bad gai he, isliye ekasaath chunaav karana sambhav nahin he
 At the same time, this argument also comes out that along with the country's population, technology and resources have also developed
 isliye ek saath chunaav ho sakate hai
 Arguments given in favor of one country one election will not have to be implemented repeatedly
 nitigat faisle liye ja sakenge
 Development work will not be affected
 nae projects kii ghoshnaa kam samay ke liye hi rukegi
 Repeated heavy election expenses will be reduced
 baar-baar chunaav karaane se desh kii aarthik sthiti bigadati he
 There will be no additional burden on the exchequer
 ek baar chunaav hone se kaledhan or bhrashtachar par roak lagane main madad milegi
 Because black money is used openly during elections
 baar-baar chunaav karaane se rajanetaaon or partiyon ko saamaajik ekta or shanti ko bhang karne kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 An atmosphere of needless tension is created
 ek saath chunaav karaane se sarkari karmchaariyon or suraksha balon ko baar-baar chunavi duty par lagane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 With this they will be able to complete their work properly
 ek desh ek chunaav ke virodh main die jane vaale tarksanvidhan main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar paanch saal kii avadhi tay he
 There is no definite provision on behalf of the Constitution for holding the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together
 isi aadhaar par yah tark diya ja rahaa he ki ek saath chunaav mul bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 One country one election is a costly process in itself
 vidhi ayog kii maane to 4,500 karod ru
 Had to buy new evms in 2019 only if there were simultaneous elections
 2024 main ekasaath chunaav karaane ke liye 1751
 17 crores will have to be spent only on evms
 centre sarkaar ke paas rajya sarkaron ko artical 356 ke tahat bhang karne kaa adhikaar he
 Notwithstanding this right, elections cannot be held simultaneously
 loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon kaa chunaav ek saath karaane par kuch vidhansabhaon ke khilaaf unke kaarykaal ko badhaayaa yaa ghataya jayega, isse rajyon kii swaittata prabhavit hogi
 When elections are held simultaneously, it is more likely that regional issues become smaller or vice versa in front of national issues
 rashtriya partiyon kaa kshetra vistrut hota jayega or kshetreey partiyon kaa dayera isse kam hoga
 Sweden and Indonesia hold elections together: In September last year, general elections, county and municipal elections were held together in Sweden
 indonesia, dakshin africa, germany, spain, hungary, slovenia, albania, poland, belgium bhi ek baar chunaav karaane kii parampara he

 ) Even though the Congress and its ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra have agreed to contest 125-125 assembly seats, Sharad Pawar's party's demand for representation in all the 36 districts of the state seats between the two parties New screw has been stuck in the sharing of
 NCP netaaon kaa kahana he ki jald hi is bare main faisla kar liya jayega ki donon partiyon evam chote sahyogi dalon ke khate main koun-koun si siten jaaengi
 The leaders of the state unit of both the parties are constantly holding meetings to decide the seats for themselves and the smaller parties
 rajya kii sabhi 288 siton ke liye 21 oktober ko matdaan or 24 oktober ko matganana he
 NCP leaders say that soon it will be decided on which seats will go to the account of both parties and small allies
 kii maharashtra ikai ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki rashtravaadi congress party kii taraf se har jile main kam se kam ek yaa do seat kii maang rakhi gayi he
 This is not practical for us as there are many areas in the state where it has little impact
 unhone kaha ki donon partiyon main lagaataar baatcheet chal rahi he
 Within a few days, we will decide the seats for our part and smaller parties
 congress ke ek anya netaa ne kaha ki NCP vidarbha main kai siton kii maang kar rahi he jabaki is kshetra main uskaa kuch khaas aadhaar nahin rahaa he
 Similarly, she has demanded 12 seats out of 36 seats in Mumbai, whereas in 2009, while in alliance, she fought only seven seats
 vaise, donon partiyon ke bich yah tay he ki donon takreeban un sabhi siton par chunaav ladengi jahaan pichhali baar donon ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Both fought separately in the last election
 congress ko 42 or rakanpa ko 41 siten mili thim
 Another problem facing the congress-ncp alliance is to satisfy smaller parties with 38 seats

 DJ was with the boys team
 gaanv ke daliton ne ladakon ko DJ baja kar jane se roka
 The area's police reached there after a ruckus on both sides
 aarope he ki is dauraan daliton ne patharav shuru kar diya
 Due to which the police vehicles were also damaged and many boys were also hurt

 jiske baad aagjanee kaa vah daur chalaa, jisamen kaiyon ke ghar jalakar khaak ho gaye
 In this ethnic violence, a person of Rajput society died

 There is silence in the village
 kuch log kheton main kaam kar rahe hai
 So women and elders are looking towards the smoke extinguished and smoldering outside the burnt houses
 gaanv main ghuste hi gharon main jali hui motorcycilen
 Burned walls and burnt houses
 ye sara manjar 5 may ko shabbirpur main hui jaateey hinsa kii kahani kah rahe hai
 Kusum is the first house on entering the village
 jo aag ke hawaale kiya ja chukaa he
 Everything in the house is burnt
 kusum bataati he ki, 'wo log DJ lekar ke aa rahe the or naare laga rahe the
 Maharana Pratap Zindabad and Ambedkar Murdabad
 hamane unase kaha ki murdaabaad ke naare mat lagaao
 'kusum also told that when arson started, all the Dalit people ran away and went to their roofs
 kusum kii baat sunakar is hinsa ke peeche kii asli vajah bhi saamne ai
 The center of the violence was the Ravidas temple in Shabbirpur village
 jahandlit samajababa sahab ambedkar kii pratimaa lagaana chahta tha
 Because it was a public place, the new statue could not be unveiled there without the permission of the administration
 dalit samudaay kaa aarope he gaanv ke duusare hisse main based rajput ambedkar kii murti lagane ke khilaaf hai
 The Dalit society also alleges that due to the opposition of the Rajputs, the administration did not allow them to place the statue of Ambedkar
 hinsa ke vakt is mandir main bhi todphod kiye jane kaa aarope he
 In this temple we met Sodas, a resident of the village
 dalit samaaj ke sodas ne ajtak ko bataaya ki dalit samaaj is mandir main ambedkar kii murti lagaana chahta tha jiskaa rajput lagaataar virodh kar rahe the
 Surdas also said, 'the Rajput society was angry with a Harijan chief again in this village

 Many shops were burnt, many houses were ransacked

 We first met Arvind Thakur here
 5 may ko hui hinsa main arvind ke haath par chot lagi thi or haath par plaster aaj bhi maujuud he
 Arvind told us that when he was returning to the village with a tractor, he also got hurt in the violence from both sides
 jab hamane arvind se poocha ki kya is puure vivaad kii jad ambedkar kii murti lagaae jane he
 So Arvind Thakur said, 'we have no objection to the installation of Ambedkar's idol, but the law says that permission is required to install a new idol
 unhen lagaana he to parmishan lekar lagaaein
 'we further met Jeetendra Kumar
 jitendra kaa kahana tha ki bina ijaajat ke vah murti lagaana chaahate the
 Jitendra told that DJ was with him when the boys were leaving but was off
 vah gaanv ke baahar bajaanaa chaahate the or police par bhi daliton ne patharav shuru kar diya
 Brijesh of Rajput society alleges that Shivkumar, the head of the village, is responsible for this whole incident, who got stoned
 vahiin rajput samaaj kii mahilaayein jinhone 5 may kii puri ghatana ko apni ankhon se dekha
 They allege that the violence started from the Dalits and not from the Thakurs
 rajput samaaj kii mahila sunita ne bataaya ki ghatana ke din kuch bachche hi the jo maharana pratap kii jayanti ke liye is gaanv se shimlana gaanv ja rahe the
 He was prevented from playing the DJ
 jab bacchon ne sawaal uthaaya to daliton or unke bich tu-tu main-main hui
 These children talked to all the people who came to Shimlana
 bacchon ne unhen bataaya ki dalit samaaj ke log DJ lekar jane nahin de rahe hai
 The head of the Dalits did not let the DJ take him
 sunita ne aage bataaya ki donon pakshon main bahes badhane ke baad baahar se or zyada ladke aa gaye
 After which the Dalits started stone pelting
 usee patharbaji ke baad maamla ugr ho gaya
 Not only this, Sunita even alleged that Dalit women themselves set fire to their homes
 sunita ke saath maujuud or mahilaon ne bhi bataaya kii jhund main aae logon main kai bahari log the
 Who did not belong to this village
 sunita ke mutabik jaise hi patharbaji main rajput samaaj ke ladke kii maut hui
 After that, the case became very violent
 is baatcheet ke dauraan rajput samaaj ke kuch or ladke vahaan par aa gaye
 Those who alleged that the Dalits themselves set fire to their homes
 rajputon ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki dalit samaaj ambedkar kii murti lagane ke liye jid par ada hua he
 If they have insistence, then the Rajputs are also insistent on not allowing the idol to be installed
 18 saal kii suvarna ne bataaya ki jab vah devband se apane college se laut kar gaanv main aa rahi thi to usne suna ki dalit ladke kah rahe the ki maharana pratap kii jayanti nahin nikalne denge
 The boys of our village came with DJ for Maharana Pratap's birth anniversary but when the fight started
 to vah DJ lekar waapas aa gaye
 Suvarna says that the boys of Rajput society did not raise any slogans, rather the Dalit society was shouting slogans of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 suvarna kaa aarope he ki marpet or patharbaji kii shuruyaat sabase pehle daliton kii ore se hui
 After which the Rajputs responded
 is hinsa ke baad prashasnic kaarywai main ilaake ke thanadhyaksh empi singh ko line hajir kar diya gaya
 Now former Police Station MP Singh refused to say anything on camera
 lekin chhipe hue camere par unhone jo kuch bhi bataaya vah ajtak kii padtaal par muhar lagaataa he
 Due to the stubborn violence on both sides, former Police Station MP Singh said that the real reason behind this ethnic violence is the insistence of the Ambedkar statue of Dalits
 rajput pratimaa ko na lagane dene kii jid main hai
 a major reason behind the violence is also the insistence of Shivkumar village head Shivkumar
 daliton ke patharav ke baad shimlana gaanv main maharana pratap jayanti manaane ke liye jamaa hue tamaam rajput shabbirpur gaanv pahunche or phir aagjanee hui
 Many of the Rajputs were from nearby villages and many from neighboring states of Haryana
 police kii report kahati he ki daliton kii ore se hue patharav main rasulpur gaanv se maharana pratap jayanti manaane ke liye aae rajput samaaj ke sumit singh kii maut ho gai
 All the people who came to avenge the death had sticks and swords in their hands
 police ne hathiyaaron se ke saath aae puure hujum ko rokane kii puri koshish kii thi
 The whole cause of this violence is the dispute of the idol, although the report of LIU states that Dalits never asked for any permission to install the idol there
 khufia sutron mutabik ravidaas mandir ke andar murti lagane ke liye jo dhaancha taiyaar kiya gaya he
 That is also illegal
 kanoon vyavastha par sawalshabbirpur main bhadkee is jaateey hinsa ke peeche keval daliton or rajputon kii jid he
 Dalits want to install Ambedkar's idol in Ravidas temple but due to opposition from Rajputs, the administration does not allow it
 is baar rajput maharana pratap kii jayanti par juluus lekar nikalnaa chaahate the, to daliton ne saalon tak dabi hui naaraazgi baahar nikaali
 After which the matter became serious to this extent

 ) The differences in the Mumbai unit of the Congress have once again come to the surface
 mumbai congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dene ke baad milind devda ab apni hi party ke netaaon ke nishane par hai
 Senior party leader and former MP Sanjay Nirupam targeted Deora, accusing him of being too eager for the national level post
 nirupam ne yah suzav dene ke liye bhi milinddevada kii aalochana kii ki maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav tak mumbai party ikai kii dekharekh ke liye congress ke teen varisht netaaon kii ek samiti banaayi jaae
 Nirupam said that such a step would cause further damage to the party
 sanjay nirupam ne twit kar kaha, ‘istipha main tyaag kii bhaavana antarnihit hoti he
 Here at the second moment the post of 'national' level is being sought
 yah istipha he yaa upar chadhane kii seedhi? party ko aise ‘karmath' logon se saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 'resignation involves a feeling of abandonment
 yahaan to duusare kshan ‘neshnal' level kaa pad maanga ja rahaa he
 Is it a resignation or a ladder to climb up? party ko aise ‘karmath' logon se saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 Let us tell you that just before the Lok Sabha elections, Deora was appointed as the Mumbai Congress President in place of Nirupam
 nirupam ne ek anya twit main likhaa, ‘adhyaksh ke sthaan par mumbai congress chalaane ke liye teen sadasyeey samiti banane kaa vichaar bilkul bhi uchit nahin he
 This will cause further damage to the party
 'bataa den kimilind devda (milind Deora) ne aaj hi apane pad se istipha de diya thaor aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon tak shahar ikai kii dekharekh ke liye teen varisht netaaon ke samuhik netritv kii sifarish kii
 Deora had expressed her intention to resign after meeting Rahul Gandhi on 26 June in New Delhi
 The idea to appoint 3 member committee to run Mumbai Congress in place of President is not at all appropriate
 It will ruin the party further
 devda ke daftar se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he, 'iske bare main mallikarjun khadge or akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke mahasachiv kasee venugopal ko avgat karaayaa gaya he
 'this step is seen as solidarity and collective responsibility after Rahul Gandhi's resignation as the President of AICC
 devda ko loksabhaa chunaav se ek maheene pehle mumbai congress adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 In such a situation, he had little time to prepare for the election

 is maamle kii jaanch yaa to sibiai se karai jaani chaiye yaa phir iske liye supreme court kii nigaraanee main ek esaiti kaa gathan hona chaiye
 Virender Pandey is not the only petitioner in the case

 Rakesh Choubey, who has filed one of those petitions, says that the documents presented by the ACB investigating the case are also wrong in the court
 rakesh choube ne enditivi india se kaha ‘asli diary ke pannon ko gaayab kar diya gaya he or jo panne adaalat main pesh kiye gayi hai wo nakli panne hai

 The Anti Corruption Bureau has not spoken to NDTV India about this, but ACB chief Mukesh Gupta has already said that he is not going to spare anyone in his investigation
 haalanki unhone is ghotaale ke bhandaphod ke baad ye bhi kaha ki unki jaanch kii apni simaayen bhi hai
 On the other hand, the state PDS Minister Punnulal Mohile has been saying that he has no fear of any investigation but in response to fresh questions from NDTV India, he said that the matter is in court and he cannot say anything on it yet

 During the hearing on the Ayodhya case, the Uttar Pradesh government said in the Supreme Court on Friday that the Muslim party is trying to postpone the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute case
 supreme court main upi sarkaar ne daleel di ki jis mudde ko elahabaad hoicourt ne bhi apane faisle main tarjeeh nahin di use supreme court main bevajaah tool diya ja rahaa he
 The UP government said that in 1994, the Supreme Court constitution bench gave its verdict in the Ismail Farrukhi case
 jisamen para 82 main likhaa tha ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa abhinn ang nahin he
 When the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court was to hear the original dispute of Ayodhya, the matter was stuck on the same paragraph of the verdict and it was decided that the first hearing should be held on it
 lihaaja adaalat ye tay karegi ki ismail farukhi vaale maamle ke faisle par phir se vichaar karne kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 If the decision of this bench is yes then the constitution bench of seven or more judges will be formed and they will decide
 faisla agar nahin main aayaa to phir mul bhoomi vivaad par bahes hogi
 This decision, which came in 1994, has become a thorn in the Muslim side at the moment

 On this, on behalf of the Uttar Pradesh government, the Dassault Solicitor General (ASG) Tushar Mehta said that the issue is being debated in the court
 ab jab ayodhya vivaad main sabhi dastavej taiyaar ho gaye, anuwaad kaa kaam puraa ho gaya to is baat kii jarurat nahin
 He said that all this is happening because the Muslim side wants to hang it further

 "let us know that in the last July, the deadline of filing of ITR was increased to 31 August by 31 August
 aise main ab itiar filing kii aakhri tithi 31 agast he
 Who can file ITR? Every citizen of the country should file ITR
 darasal, itiar filing se matlab ye he ki aap sarkaar ko apni kamai-nivesh or anya kharch kii jaankaree de rahe hai
 If you are liable for tax after filing ITR, you have to pay tax
 chartered acountint sike mishra kehete hai, ''jo log credit card kaa zyada istemaal karte hai yaa videsh ke daure par jate hai yaa phir paison kaa adhik len-dein karte hai unako jarur iti ritern daakhil karnaa chahie
 Otherwise, notice of Income Tax Department can be found
 ''unhone aage bataaya ki khaastaur se jinaki inakam yogya he unako der nahin kerani chahie or jurmaane se bachane ke liye 31 agast se pehle inakam tex daakhil kar dena chahie

 Penalty may be imposed on delay
 If you do not file the return by 31 August, you may have to pay a fine of up to Rs 5,000

 Those whose taxable income is less than five lakh rupees during the said financial year, they will have to pay a fine of only Rs 1,000 after 31 August
 paanch lakh rupee se adhik aay vaale taxperes ko ek sitambar se lekar 31 disambar 2019 tak ritern daakhil karne par 5,000 rupee or uske baad ek janvari 2020 se lekar 31 march 2020 tak iskar ritern daakhil karne par 10,000 rupee jurmaana bharna padegaa

 Since Narendra Modi has a crush on the entire country, the punters have spoken of BJP winning more seats, but the bookies are considering Aam Aadmi Party as the second party in Delhi
 bookies jahaan rajdhani main bijepi ke 3-4 siton par jeet darj karne kii baat kah rahe hai vahiin aam aadmi party 2-3 siten de rahe hai
 The most surprising thing is that the bookies have assumed that only one seat will come in the account of the Congress and it is possible that they cannot even open the account
 congress kii jeetne vaali siton ko lekar bookies khatra nahin mol le rahe
 Yes, if someone makes a bet, then the Congress party will get the highest price

 1
 kaajal lagane se pehle bahut jaruri he ki aap apana cheharaa toner se saaf kar len

 2
 Apply some powder under the eyes before applying mascara
 aap chahen to ankhon ke neeche brush yaa spanj kii madad se powder laga sakati hai
 3
 hameshaa water pruf kaajal kaa istemaal karen
 Waterproof mascara does not spread and lasts for a long time
 4
 It is less spread by applying mascara with eyeliner

 ham apni jindagi kaa quality time apane daftar main or kaligs ke saath bitaate hai, to jaruri ho jaataa he ki ham unase kuch sikhte bhi chalem
 In this case, some very important suggestions are presented
 
 
 1
 Being technology friendly: It happens to all of us that when you start work in a new place, you are not aware of all the things, but there are definitely people on the workplace who are updated in terms of technology
 kisi se madad maangane main koi beijjati nahin he
 You too will be friends with instant technology
 2
 Silence: Silence says that there is no beautiful word
 aapke offismen kuch log aise jarur honge jinka maun unke shabdon se zyada prabhavi hota he
 You can learn to present words and emotions to others
 yakeen maniye, aisa kar lene maatr se aap bheed main alag dikhalaai padege
 3
 jarurat padane par jarur bolnaa:aisa kai baar hota he ki group meetings or idia discshan main hamaare paas dheron baaten hoti hai lekin ham kuch bhi bolne se kataraate hai
 At the same time, we also have colleges that remain the favorites of the boss on our ideas
 hamen is baat ko samajhane kii jarurat he ki hameshaa bak-bak karne ke bajaay samay par munh kholana kitna jaruri he
 After all, it is a matter of job and promotion
 4
 Professionalism: It needs to be understood with full understanding that work is a part of life other than friendship
 jahaan ham apni vaastaviktaa ke itar maujuud hote hai
 In such a situation, we must learn professionalism from our colleges
 kab kisase bolnaa he or kab nahin
 How much to speak and when to stop speaking
 daftar main kaligs,junior or seniorase kis tarah bihev karnaa he
 All this comes under the purview of professionalism
 5
 Dressing Sense: Significantly, a good dress increases your confidence in the same way that home food increases your energy level when you are hungry
 achche or saaf-suthere kapade pahanane vaale kaligs ko sabhi notice karte hai, or aisa koun sa insaan hoga jo dusron kii najaron main na aana chaahe
 The children playing in the crowded street of Ambedkar Vihar, Sector-37, ahead of Noida's Harebhare Golfcourse, ask what Uncle Roshan found
 
 
 in sawaalon ko maheene bhar se sunate aa rahe ganesh ke sharir par harakat tak nahin hui or bade se angan jaise ek charadivari ke andar ghus jate hai
 a slim woman comes out from a room full of smell and dampness, "you are from the media, look, our 10-year-old child has been missing for a month, but to find what someone is missing
" " Ganesh angrily scolds his wife, "shut up sir, he has come for the same
 " ganesh ke bagal main lakshmi khadi he, wo bhi rone lagati he
 His 12-year-old son Vishal is also missing along with Roshan since 10 January
 subah uthakar roj apni maa ke saath sabji bechata tha phir shaam kii shift main padhane jaataa tha
 i looked at Roshan's bag, which was in the hands of his mother Kajo Devi
 main uski kitaab dekhne laga
 Good was written on many pages
 teesri class main padhane vaale roshan kii angreji kii ryting gajab kii thi
 Both the children were Roshan and Vishal friends and roamed together
 lekin 10 janvari jab kadaake kii thand pad rahi thi, tab ek kapade main donon bachche is bazaar main aise saste saamaan kii tarah gaayab ho gaye ki ab tak unka koi suraag nahin he
 Noida police say that the two knew each other and may have left home and gone somewhere
 lekin jis bharat main har roj 3 hazaar bachche gaayab ho rahe hon, jis desh main bhens or kute khojane ke liye lakhon ke inam die jate ho, vahaan kaajo devi or lakshmi ke bete khojane kii koshish bhala kyon hon
 If you search for them, you will not get a huge prize or promotion
 police ke paas bacchon ke gum hone kaa aisi badi sankhya or apni nahili par rone ke liye kam staff kaa itnaa bada bahaanaa he ki iske saamne daityakaar tark bhi bouna ho jaae
 But in this society people like Rishi Bajpayee, who is a software engineer and rickshaw puller Ganesh got so emotional that they are helping the family by spending money out of pocket from social media to vacation
 ham keval aise vakt main ummid kar sakate hai or apni jimmedaariyon kaa boj bhagwaan bharose chhodkar apane bacchon ke liye toffee le aate hai
 Go or else the shop will be closed and the baby cry, you will feel sorry for your life

 kai dinon kii badhotaree ke baad petrol or dijal kii keemat main katautee hui he
 Petrol became 6 paise per liter on Thursday, while diesel became cheaper by 6-7 paise per liter
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko petrol or dijal ke daam main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that for the first time after the voting of the last phase of Lok Sabha elections on May 19, the price of oil has been cut
 isse pehle petrol ke daam main 18 may ko jabaki dijal ke daam main 14 may ko katautee kii gai thi
 Where the price of oil marketing companies in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai has reduced the price of petrol by 6 paisa a liter
 dijal dilli, kolkata or mumbai main chah paise prati litre jabaki chennai main 7 paise prati litre sasta ho gaya he
 After this cut, petrol prices in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai decreased to 71 respectively
 80 rupee, 73
 86 rupees, 77
 41 rupee or 74
 53 per liter
 dijal ke daam bhi chaaron mahanagaron main ghatakar kramash: 66
 63 rupees, 68
 39 rupee, 69
 82 rupees and 70
 43 rupee prati litre ho gaye hai
 The crisis is not yet over! According to market experts, this is an immediate relief
 aane vaale dinon main tel ke daam badhate rahenge
 In fact, because of the election, according to the international market, the price of petrol and diesel should be increased as much as the entire burden was not passed on to the customers
 aise main ab tel companiyaan vasuuli kar rahi hai
 Please tell that the oil companies kept the prices of petrol and diesel completely stable during the Karnataka elections in May 2018, while during this time the price of fuel in the international market went up by about five dollars per barrel
 lekin chunaav khatm hote hi puraa boj graahakon par daal diya gaya
 The same was done during the Gujarat assembly elections in December 2017
 ye lagbhag sabhi ko pataa he ki jeeyo ek nayaa broadband sarvice laane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, jo iske bharat main company ke wireles jeeyo 4G ko saport karegaa
 We have already shared with you that this service will be named jiofiber and it will be launched in select cities in the coming days
 aaj ham aapako jiofiber sarvice plance kii kuch exclusive jaankariyaan or company kii taiyaariyon kii jaankaree saajha kar rahe hai
 Behind jiofiber is the same idea of jio that the company had launched at the time of Jio 4G, to provide cheap internet to the customers and get hold of the market

 Does the Collegium System Work? Justice P
 en
 The Bhagwatiyah system does not work satisfactorily
 main iske paksh main nahin hum
 i do not know the reality, but pay attention to the rumors, there is a bargain among the judges who are kept in the collegium

 Therefore, it has become necessary to change it
 nyaayamurti je
 s
 varmnagar colegium main aam sahmati nahin banati to karypalika ke paas niyukti na karne kaa vikalp hota he
 Who should be blamed for this if the executive does not take action despite the verdict and authority? Does the executive have no role in the appointments? The recommendation of bhagwaticollegium is accepted without exception
 agar aapatti kaa koi aadhaar hota he to sarkaar use colegium ke saamne rakh detii he jo is bare main phir faisla karata he
 He had a role in bringing Varmaramswamy forward
 isaki sabase badi bhoomika prakriya shuru karne main he
 The executive decides not to take action for political or other reasons as per its convenience
 kya nyaayik uttardaayitv ko tay karne ke liye philhal koi vyavastha he?bhagwatinigaraanee kii paryaapt vyavastha nahin he, lekin baar ko bahut chaukanna rahane kii jarurat he
 If lawyers believe that a judge is corrupt, they should have the power to expose it
 or agar kisi vaadi ko yah lagata he ki koi nyaayadhish rishwat maang rahaa he to use kisi satarkta sanstha ko khabar dene main samarth hona chahie
 a law needs to be enacted to enforce judicial accountability, as envisioned by the Constitution and democracy
 ekmaatr cheez vah vyavastha he, jo is par nirbhar karegi ki aap use kis str par lagu karnaa chaahate hai
 Will the Lokpal Bill help in this? Bhagwati nyaaypalika ko lokapal ke adheen nahin laayaa janaa chahie
 There should be a separate institution to look after their independence and functioning
 agar nyaaypalika ko lokapal ke adheen kar diya jayega to mujhe ashanka he ki is par rajnatik prabhaav daalaa jane lagegaa
 Vermalokpal cannot cover the higher judiciary
 adhinsth nyaaypalika kii nigaraanee ucch nyaaypalika karti he
 Now if no external agency can control the subordinate judiciary, then how do you expect the external agency to control the big judges? If a judge refuses to resign? Bhagwati should raise voice in such a situation
 agar koi nyaayadhish bhrasht he or mukhya nyaayadhish is silsile main koi karrwai nahin karata he to us sthiti main vakeelon ko aawaaj uthaani chahie
 Because of vermin, law is needed
 kisi pratyaksh athurity yaa vyavastha ke abhaav main bhi nyaayadhishon or mukhya nyaayadhish ne galati karne vaale nyaayadhishon se nibatane ke tareeke nikaal liye hai, kam se kam unhen nyaayik adhikaar se vanchit kar diya jaataa he

 He has been made Mentor
 simons ko dairedevills kaa mukhya coach niyukt karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue frenchiji ke maalik jiemr sports ne kaha ki isse team ko apni khoi pratishtha hasil karne main madad milegi
 The team led by Virender Sehwag was at the bottom of the table in the IPL this year
 usne 14 match main se keval chaar main jeet darj kii thi
 Sehwag, who has just gone on an Australian tour, said that Simmons would benefit a lot from joining
 unhone kaha, erik ne gendbaaji coach ke taur par acha kaam kiya he or vah ab mukhya coach ke rup main bhi aisa kar saktaa he
 He can make a difference, as he has been associated with the team for the last two years
 yadi koi doosraa aata, to hamen shuru se shuruyaat kerani hoti
 It is good that Eric has held this position and i hope he plays his role well

 The title contender, India, will be eyeing revenge when it faces co-hosts Bangladesh on Saturday in the opening match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup
 mahendra singh dhoniki team haalanki puri tarah satark hogi kyonki koi bhi kotahi use baari pad sakati he
 Bangladesh's weak team defeated India in their opening match at the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, and laid the foundation for the team to be eliminated from the first round and Dhoni and his team avenged the defeat in their campaign at sher-e-bangla Stadium
 Will come with the goal of making a positive start
 khitaab ke daavedaaron main shumaar duniya kii duusare number kii bhartiya team kaaphi santulit he lekin pratibhavan khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi ke kaaran captain dhoni ko chayan muddon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Dhoni, however, seems to have solved his problem with the batting department when he hinted at Virat Kohli's preference over Suresh Raina after the second practice match against New Zealand
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘number chaar kram hamaare liye kaaphi ahm he
 Right now this place remains like war
 chauthe number par kohli ko ballebaaji karne kii jarurat he jabaki gautam gambhir tisare number par utrenge
 Dhoni said, "kohli is a player who takes a little time to settle down initially and then strikes the bowlers
 phir bhi sambhaavna he ki maujuuda form ko dekhte hue viraat ko suresh raina par tarjeeh mili
 The Indian captain also indicated that he will feed Yuvraj as he is important to the team due to his ability to spin the ball despite poor form with the bat
 unhone kaha, ‘ham chaar gendbaajon ke saath khel rahe hai
 The improvised spinner is very important, especially if he is a left-arm spinner who makes the ball spin outward
 anya khilaadiyon ke upar yaheen uskaa (yuvaraj) palada baari he
 The Indian batting attack will be led by Sachin Tendulkar, who is participating in his sixth World Cup tournament and his eyes will be set on giving India a quick start with Virender Sehwag
 gautam gambhir tisare number par ballebaaji karne utrenge jabaki kohli, dhoni, yuvaraj or yusuf pathan kii maujuudagi main madhyakram kaaphi majboot najar aata he
 All these players have the ability to play big shots and rotate strikes
 bharat ne apane duusare or antim abhyaas match main newjiland ke khilaaf 360 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha or isse ballebaajon visheshkar dhoni or gambhir kaa manobal kaaphi badha hoga
 Dhoni scored an unbeaten 108 while Gambhir smashed 89 runs in this match
 newjiland ke khilaaf kohli or raina ne bhi ardhashatak banaaye the or dhoni ko ummid hogi ki unke khilaadi is acchhee farm main jari rakhenge
 In the bowling department, Dhoni will have to choose his options with caution as the team is coming down with four bowlers
 bhartiya spinneron harbhajan singh or piyush chawla ne do abhyaas maichon main kramash: paanch or chah wicket chatkaye hai
 Even r Ashwin and improvised spinner Yuvraj have taken two and three wickets respectively
 iske vipareet tej gendbaajon ko sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 Ashish Nehra has managed to get two wickets while s Sreesanth has joined the team in place of Praveen Kumar
 iske alaava munaf patel ko abhyaas maichon main koi wicket nahin mila
 But Zaheer Khan, who did not play in practice matches due to a minor injury, will play tomorrow and Indian fast bowlers can be expected to perform better
