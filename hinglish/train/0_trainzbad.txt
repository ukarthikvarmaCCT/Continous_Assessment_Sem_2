 Akhilesh Yadav said that this election is an election to save the country, save the institutions of the country

 The Lok Sabha elections are being held in seven phases and the results will be out on 23 May

 This is an election to save the country
 aaj ham jis tarah kii chijen dekh rahe hai wo kabhi is desh main nahin huin
 Supreme Court judges come out and say that democracies are in danger
 aaj ek artical main kaha gaya he ki ye sarkaar loktantr ke liye bada khatra he
 Those who are accusing us of being racist, see what people are doing in Uttar Pradesh today
 chunaav main jati or dharm kaa istemaal kiye jane par sapa pramukh ne kaha ki kaha ki baat sirf dalit, yadav, muslim kii nahin he, mahilaayein hamen badi sankhya main vot de rahi hai kyonki dimple hamaare saath hai
 He said that Shatrughan Sinha did not get Congress ticket at the time when Poonam Sinha's ticket was finalized
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki shatrughna sinha se meri baatcheet hui, maine ofer nahin kiya tha, lekin unhone kaha tha ki main nahin lard saktaa hum kyonki maine patna kii janata se vaada kiya hua he
 They had said that their party can change the constituency will not change
 unhone kaha ki main apni wif ko ladaa saktaa hum
 Akhilesh Yadav also told that he has fielded Poonam Sinha from the capital of Uttar Pradesh at the behest of the Kayastha Samaj of Lucknow
 lekin jab amethi-raibareli main congress ke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaarne par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki vah congress ke liye soft nahin hai
 He said that Congress has been given two seats in the SP-BSP alliance
 mayawati ji or ham logon ne milakar ye faisla liya tha ki ham unako gathbandhan main shaamil karenge or amethi va raibareli kii siten unke liye chodenge
 This was a joint decision of both of us
 hamane mana ki ye paramparaagat rup se congress kii siten hai
 However there is no difference between BJP and Congress
 inaki nitiyon kii vajah se hi desh kii ye haalat he
 At the time when we had talks and decided the seats, at that time we decided to leave these two seats, but that does not mean that i am soft towards the Congress

 Dissatisfied Congress MP YS Jaganmohan Reddy will meet party president Sonia Gandhi and will regret his targeting of Sonia, Rahul and the party through his television channel
 yah daawa jagan ke chachaa ne aaj yahaan kiya
 YS Vivekananda Reddy, brother of the late YS Rajasekhara Reddy, told reporters here that when Jagan meets Sonia, he will also accompany her
 haalanki, unhone yah nahin kaha ki yah mulaakaat kab hogi
 Jagan-owned Telugu television channel 'sakshi' last week targeted Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress
 iske baad mukhyamantri ke rosaiya ke pad se hatane samet kai rajnatik ghatnakram dekhne ko mili the
 Vivekananda Reddy said that every Congress was hurt by the attack on the party and its top leaders through the channel, but tried to say that Jagan may not be aware of it
 unhone kaha ki channel ke sampadakon ko aise prasaranon ke bare main uchit salaah di jaani chahie
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal has said that if the people of Delhi want, then only they will form the government
 unhone kaha ki satta main aane ke baad ham chaar maheene ke bheetar bijli companiyon kii audit karavaaenge
 Get you checked for fast moving meters and incorrect bills
 aaj tak ke saath khaas mulaakaat main kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaari party bijli ke daam 50 fisadi kam karne ke liye patibaddh he, chaahe iskaa nateeja kuch bhi ho
 Tata and Ambani have to go
 bharat main nijee companiyon kii kami nahin he
 Kejriwal admitted that SMS poll is not the right way to know public opinion
 unhone kaha ki 270 sabhaaon se janata kaa mood jaanane main kaaphi madad milegi
 It is a big thing for our party to get 28 seats for the first time
 agar janata kahegi to ham sarkaar banaaenge
 He said that we cannot eradicate corruption alone
 kejariwal ne kaha ki bijli ke daam karne ke baad hamaari duusari praathamikta pichley 15 saalon main dilli main hue ghotaalon kii jaanch karana he
 During the tenure of Sheila Sarkar, corruption ministers will go to jail
 emsidi main pichley 7 saalon se raaj kar rahi bijepi ke bhrashtachari netaaon ko bhi jail bheja jayega
 Kejriwal does not want any government to form a government in Delhi by gaining the support of any party, but his party (AAP) itself has differences over it
 kuch log chaahate hai ki sarkaar bane to kuch log iske khilaaf hai
 Kejriwal himself accepted this matter
 kejariwal ne kaha ki unke ‚Äòguru‚Äô (anna hajaare) unke dil main hai
 However, political parties with vested interests have spent crores of rupees to create a rift between the two
 kejariwal ne kaha ki aise kai log hai jo maanate hai ki ye donon (anna or kejariwal) saath aakar ‚Äòatom bam‚Äô se bhi shaktishaalee ho jaaenge
 Kejriwal admitted that he had differences with Hazare over the Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki vah maanate hai ki yah vidheyak ‚Äòkamjor‚Äô he or majboot janalokapal vidheyak ke liye sangharsh karte rahenge
 Kejriwal said that he would respect the decision of the public
 chaahe vah party ke liye ho yaa uske khilaaf
 He said that there were differences in the party on this matter and during the meeting of mlas, there was a view that one should not refrain from forming the government, because Congress is giving it unconditional support
 kuch vidhayakon ke anusaar, party apana agenda lagu kar paaegi, kyonki congress kii taraf se koi dakhlandaji nahin hogi
 Some said that the government should be run for as long as possible
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'main vyaktigat rup se sarkaar banane ke khilaaf tha, kyonki hamane baar-baar kaha he ki ham congress athwa bijepi ko na to samarthan denge or na hi unase samarthan lenge, lekin baad main logon ke ek varg ne yah kahana shuru kar diya ki hamen sarkaar banani chahie, jabaki doosraa varg iskaa virodh kar rahaa tha, isliye hamane is bare main faisla lene ke liye janata ke paas jane kaa faisla kiya
 However, he said that the decision to form the government in Delhi will be made on Sunday night and it will be announced on Monday

 Anil Goswami has been removed from the post of Union Home Secretary for interfering in the issue of Matang Singh, a former MP arrested in the Saradha scam
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne yah faisla kiya he
 Rural Development Secretary LC Goyal will replace him
 goyal kerala kader ke 1979 batch ke adhikari hai
 Sharda scam: Former Minister Matang Singh arrested: Anil Goswami was accused of influencing the CBI to stop the arrest of former Union Minister Matang Singh
 is khulaase ke baad unhen buudhvaar ko pehle grih mantri or iske baad pradhanmantri karyaalay dwaara talab kiya gaya
 This is the second incident in a week to remove the top bureaucrat
 isse pehle gat buudhvaar ko videsh sachiv sujatha singh ke sevakaal main tab katautee kar di gai thi jab unhone apane pad se tyaagptr dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Goswami, who completed 60 years of age last month, had a tenure till June 30, but his continuation in the post became unstable when he confessed to Home Minister Rajnath Singh that he had arrested Singh in Kolkata on Saturday
 Talked to CBI officials who arrested him earlier
 1977 batch ke jammu-kashmir cader ke iees adhikari goswami ko purvavarti samprag sarkaar ne grih sachiv niyukt kiya tha or unka do varshon kaa kaarykaal is saal june tak he
 He turned 60 on 31 January this year
 agar sarkaar unke khilaaf maamle main karrwai karne kaa faisla karti he to unhen barkhaast karne yaa unhen istipha dene kii anumati dene ke simit vikalp hai
 Troubled by this development, Goswami refused to answer media questions
 mediakarmi north block main unke kamare ke baahar unki pratikriya lene ke liye pratiksha kar rahe the
 Later Goswami said, 'have you ever heard me say anything to the media
 ‚Äôgrih mantri ne sibiai nideshak anil sinha ko bhi kol kiya
 Sinha briefed the Home Minister about the developments before Singh's arrest
 sinha ne bhi grih mantri ke karyaalay ke baahar pratiksharat mediakarmiyon ke kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 The CBI director held a separate meeting with Goswami
 agency main sutron ne bataaya ki aisa samajha jaataa he ki sibiai ne is sambandh main pradhanmantri ke karyaalay ko ek report bheja he
 How many calories are in canned juice? How much sugar has been mixed above? How much salt is in canned pickles, which oil is it? Just writing vegetable oil will not work anymore, is there any vegetable oil, how much fat is there and how much trans fat? The answer to these questions arising in the minds of consumers is not available at the moment, but the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) has taken the first step in this direction
 haalanki is droft ke kanoon banane or lagu hone ke bich abhi kuch saalon kaa safar tay karnaa baaki he
 The arbitrariness of food companies will no longer work
 unhen bataanaa hoga ki unke packaged food main kya-kya he? darasal, bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaran (ethesai) ne ab upabhokta kii sehat se saath ho rahe khilwaad par lagaam lagane kaa man bana liya he
 FSSI has drafted the Indian Food Safety and Standards (labeling and Display) Regulations 2019
 iske mutabik ab companiyon ko dibba band khaane ke packet yaa dibbe main sari jaankaree deni padegi
 Amit Khurana of Food Safety and Toxins, director, programs, programs at the Center for Science and Environment, says, "consumers have every right to know all about their food
 aise main yah behad sakaaratmak kadam he
 Now just waiting for this new regulations to be implemented
 "darasal siesai 2012 se lagaataar is disha main kaam kar rahi he
 In 2016, FSSI was also submitted a report by CSE titled 'food labeling claims and advertising'
 isamen dibbaband khaane main labling ke mudde or vigyapanon main di jane vaali bhraamak jaankaree ke mudde ko gambhirtha se na keval uthaaya gaya tha balki yah bhi bataay gaya tha ki food companiyaan par lagaam lagane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 However, given the pace of FSSI and how many years now consumers will have to go through the arbitrariness of food companies, it is difficult to get a precise idea
 draft main kam se kam teen saal kii samay seemaa darj kii gai he
 FSSI was formed under the Indian Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006
 tab se lekar ab tak 17 saal biit chuke hai
 Meanwhile, FSSI has always been under the scanner for the right to healthy food
 is bare main india today ke november 2018 main chhapi report, cor-cor main kadavaahat ke baad ethesai harakat main ai he or yah masauda saamne aayaa he
 What information has to be given? 1- The nutrients of canned food such as calories, saturated fat, trans fat, added sugar, sodium (salt) should be written in front of the box or packet
 2- diet ke hisaab se kis poshak tatv ke liye rojaanaa kitni maatra kii jarurat hoti he, uskaa kitna hissaa dibbaband khaane main yah bhi spasht likhnaa padegaa
 3- If there is more quantity of canned food than the required nutrient daily, then a red colored mark will have to be made in the front of the packet or box
 taaki upabhokta samaj sake ki yah khaanaa sehat ke lihaaj se kitna nuksandaayak he
 4- You will also have to write about allergies caused by certain types of food
 matlab kuch logon ko kaashew se to kuch ko moongfalee se allergy hoti he
 It is also common to be allergic to soybean cheese

 ' farvari kii pehali taarikh se sarkaar kii ore se i-commers main epadi ke niyamon main kiye gaye badlaav lagu ho gaye
 The main objective of the change in rules is to keep an eye on the huge discounts being offered by e-commerce companies
 saath hi nae niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad koi bhi company kisi brand ke saath eksclusive deal karke apane placeform par saamaan nahin bech sakati
 Apart from this, to increase competition and create more opportunities in the market, the condition of buying a maximum of 25 percent of goods from any one vendor has also been applied to e-commerce companies
 nae niyamon ko lagu karne kii taarikh aage badhaane ko lekar i-commers companiyon ne sarkaar se arji lagaai, lekin chunaav se pehle koi jokhim na lete hue sarkaar ne isamen koi raahat nahin di
 Businessmen of the country welcomed the extension of the date
 lekin is bich bada sawaal yah he ki desh main teji se badhate is i-commers market par nae niyamon kaa kya asar hoga? saath hi isse kise phayda or kise nuksaan hoga?khatm honge bade discount?market share or jiemavi (gros merkendiese vailu) badhaane ke liye graahakon ko i commers companiyaan bade cashbek or discount kii peshkash karti thi
 But after the new rules, attractive deals may get some break
 aise main online shopping karne vaale graahakon ko aane vaale dinon main tyohaaron par milane vaale bade ophers nadaarad rah sakate hai
 Companies like Walmart, Amazon will be directly affected by this
 desh main teji se badhate online shopping ke chalan kaa bada kaaran yah tha ki online graahakon ko achche ophers milte the
 Now, if there are no good offers, then surely the growth in sales of these companies may slow down
 choti companiyaan jo kisi placeform par apana saamaan bechati thim unhen apni kshamta badhaane par kharch karnaa hoga kyonki 25 fisadi se zyada maal kisi ek vendor se na lene kii shart us company kii bikri ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Indian companies and offline markets will benefit from this
 kyonki keemat main bahut antar na hone par graahak bazaar kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 The effect of this effort of the government in the changing trend of shopping shows that the response from the e-commerce companies on the occasion of the billion day sale on the coming festivals will be known

 "sunny is very happy with this success, Sunny got very emotional after getting a big chance

 The researchers said that the Sundarbans region of Bangladesh and India spread over an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers is the largest mangrove forest on earth and also the most important area for the endangered Bengal tiger

 "this is actually a very small number for a tiger," Lawrence said

 Sharif Mukul, an assistant professor at Independent University Bangladesh, said, "according to our analysis, the most terrible thing is that tiger habitats in the Sundarbans will be completely destroyed by 2070

 ravivaar ko patna ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main 28 saal ke antaraal ke baad congress apane dam par raily karne ja rahi he jisamen congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi shaamil hone vaale hai
 In order to make the Congress's 'jan Akanksha Rally' a success, activists have covered all parts of Patna with banners and posters and it has now become a problem for party president Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, congress kaaryakartaaon ne jo binar or poster shahar main lagaaein hai unamem se kai main rahul gandhi ko ram ke avatar main dikhaaya gaya he, jise lekar rahul gandhi ke khilaaf pariwaad patr daayar kiya gaya he
 Even after this, this poster attack of Congress continues
 congress ne nayaa poster jari kiya he jisamen piem modi ko ravan ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 Complainant Rakesh Dutt Mishra, who is the general secretary of the Bharatiya Jan Kranti Dal, has filed a libel letter in the CJM court against Rahul Gandhi, along with Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha and party worker Vijay Kumar Singh
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki rahul ko ram ke avatar main dikhaane se hinduon kii bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchi he
 Significantly, such posters were installed by Congress worker Vijay Kumar Singh in many parts of the capital in which Rahul Gandhi was shown as Ram
 is vivaadit poster par ishaaron- ishaaron main bijepi par bhi hamalaa kiya gaya tha or likhaa gaya tha ki 'vah ram naam japate rahen, tum banakar ram jio re'

 is poster main rahul ram kii bhoomika main he or unhen ravan par tir chalaate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Let me tell you that many big leaders of the Grand Alliance are likely to join Rahul Gandhi in which RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Hindustani Awam Morcha national president Jeetan Ram Manjhi, Democratic Janata Dal president Sharad Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party national president and Former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha is included

 As a prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi had promised in 2014 that justice would be provided to displaced Kashmiri Pandits
 piem ne saadhe chaar saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kar liya he lekin visthapit kashmiri pandit abhi bhi jammu shahar ke baahar bane rifuji campon main rahane ke liye majaboor hai
 Sunil Bhatt of India Today visited the Awakening Refugee Camp outside Jammu and tried to know what Prime Minister Modi has done to provide relief to the displaced Kashmiri Pandits
 jaagti raahat camp kaa jayja lene pahunchi india today kii team ko camp main bane flats kii deevaaren chatki milin or siver linon main licage mila
 Many of the camp flats are in such a state that it can be said that they can collapse at any time
 raahat camp main yah flats visthapit kashmiriyon ko 2011 main aavantit kiye gaye the
 The BJP, which contested in 2014, promised them that they would work to develop this relief camp of Jagati like a satellite town and equip them with all facilities
 haalanki in flats kii jarjar haalat ko dekhte hue saaf lag rahaa he ki yah kisi bhi samay dhah sakate hai or yahaan rahane vaale sharnaarthiyon ke liye jaanaleva sabit ho sakate hai
 The refugees living in relief camps during the last four years are constantly visiting government offices but they are not being heard anywhere
 in campon main kuch logon kaa yah daawa bhi he ki raahat camp main flats kaa nirmaan ghatiya saamagree kaa istemaal karte hue kiya gaya he jiske chalate ye flats girane ke kagaar par hai
 'stoner', who managed to harm Kashmir, lost 3 years of economic speed, reached the camp and talked to some people, it was found that people here are angry with Modi government and they believe that the government promised to give them justice He has turned his face to it
 ek visthapit kashmiri pandit vir ji sambli ne kaha ki 2014 ke baad unhen modi sarkaar se badi ummid thi lekin purv kii sarkaron kii tarah yah sarkaar bhi unhen nyaay dilaane main puri tarah se vifal rahi he
 Another refugee Jyoti said that she was very happy after the formation of the BJP government under Modi's leadership at the center, but now the biggest question is what did Narendra Modi do for us in four and a half years? Jyoti said that her family had high hopes from Narendra Modi but now he is only found on TV saying brothers and sisters
 jyoti ko is raahat camp main tab laayaa gaya jab 2011 main unke sasur kaa aatankiyon ne katl kar diya tha
 Jyoti hails from Habbakadal, Srinagar
 gauratlab he ki is camp main bane flats kaa nirmaan 2011 main puraa hua tha or sharnaarthiyon ko aavantit kiya gaya
 It has been 8 years since the construction of the flat
 siver pipe se behate pani ke chalate ye flats aaj girane ke kagaar par hai
 Where has the promise of making satellite town and equipped with facilities gone? The condition of the youth living in these relief camps is even worse
 camp main rah rahe suraj sharma kaa sawaal he ki aakhir vah naukariyaan kahaan gayi jiskaa vaada 2014 main unase kiya gaya tha
 Terrorism breaks repeatedly breaks the lifeline of Kashmiri economy
 Construction work is going on in some houses in this relief camp
 camp main rahane waalon ne bataaya ki haal hi main rajya sarkaar ne marammat ke kaam ko manjuuri di he jiske chalate kuch flaton main marammat kaa kaam dhire-dhire chal rahaa he
 When the situation of the flats was discussed with the regional authorities, they claimed that the work of repairing the flats was being done in a phased manner
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne raahat kamishnar manohar laal raina ne mana ki camp main kuch mudde hai lekin marammat kaa kaam kanoonee adchanon ke chalate shuru nahin kiya ja sakaa
 At present, the government has given a budget of Rs 10 crore for the repair of the flats and work has started
 raahat camp kii kharaab sthiti par raajnneeti bhi ho rahi he
 Ravinder Sharma, the chief spokesperson of the Congress party in the state, said that Kashmiri Pandits are unable to leave the relief camps and go to their homes due to Pakistan-backed terrorism
 upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main kai kashmiri pandit pariwaron ko srinagar main waapas basaane main safalataa mili thi or lagbhag 3000 logon ko naukari di gai
 At the same time, BJP leader Ravinder Raina said that it is the priority of the Modi government to create such an atmosphere at the earliest that Kashmiri Pandits can be sent to their homes
 ghati se kashmiri panditon ke nirvaasan ko 29 saal ho chuke hai or ek ke baad ek sarkaron se keval vaade mili hai
 But nobody has taken any meaningful step to rehabilitate him yet

 In such a situation, they believe in their complicity in stealing the house

 RJD MP Pappu Yadav has stepped up his campaign to rein in doctors' fees
 pappu ne privet practice karne vaale doctoron ke khilaaf ab jan adaalat lagane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Unhappy with their decree on doctors, mps will hold a Jan Adalat at Patel Maidan in Saharsa on 13 October
 vahaan iske liye puure rajya se log bulaae ja rahe hai, jisamen manamaani karne vaale, zyada fees vasuulne vaale, jaanch ke naam par marijon se ugaahi karne vaale, dawa companiyon se kamishan lene vaale doctoron ke khilaaf muhim tej kii jaaegi
 Also in Bihar, there will be a demand to implement the Narsing Home Act based on the decision of the Supreme Court
 patna main press conference karke pappu yadav ne elaan kar diya ki ab janata kii raishumaari karke ve 'villen' doctoron ke khilaaf muhim chhedenge
 Well, doctors will fall for it, who are sucking the blood of poor people
 pappu yadav ne kaha, '90 fisadi doctor jallaad hai, narpishaach hai
 They suck the blood of the poor
 inke khilaaf 13 oktober ko saharsa main jan adaalat lagaakar abhiyaan shuru karenge
 Pappu Yadav says that he will do all this by asking the public
 unhone kaha, 'gaanv-gaanv main doctoron ke khilaaf raishumaari shuru karenge
 From today, the opinion has started against doctors from Khagaria
 logon se poocha jayega ki kaise mili aise doctoron se mukti? yah bhi bataaya jayega ki koun-koun se doctor villen hai
 'pappu Yadav did not stop here
 unhone kaha, 'privet aspataal or kukuramute kii tarah ug rahe jaanch ghar khun chusane vaale or jallaad jaise ban gaye hai
 The brokerage is taking place through ambulance and asha worker
 'pappu yadav ne kaha, 'privet practice karne waalon ke ghar mahangi gaadiyaan kahaan se aa rahi hai? dawaai companiyaan doctoron ko dilli main jameen de rahi hai
 Pappu said that an institution like IMA has become a hub of politics
 ye sirf apni raajnneeti karti hai, inhen bihar kii janata se koi matlab nahin he
 Look at these people and see how they rob the public
 doctoron ke khilaaf bolte hue pappu ne sarkaar ke saamne kai maangen rakhi hai
 These are their demands
 
 
 1
 All government employees, officers and public representatives should be treated only in a government hospital
 2
 Private practice of all government doctors should stop
 3
 Those who become doctors after studying from government medical colleges should be prohibited from working in private hospitals
 apane hi sarkaar ke khilaaf bolne par jab pappu yadav se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha, 'sarkaar kaa dar adhikariyon main khatm hi ho gaya he
 After Nitish's withdrawal, the officers have become unbridled
 nitish ke vakt adhikariyon main dar tha, lekin aaj vah dar nahin rahaa
 ' pashchim bengal ke teen jilon or lagbhag teen sau gaanvon ke log haathiyon ke aatank se pareshaan hai
 Herd of elephants enter the fields of farmers and destroy the standing crop with their hard work and capital
 isse kisaanon ko baari aarthik nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 In West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts, man-elephant conflict has become common
 haathiyon se pareshangramin panchnaag mahato bataate hai, hathi roj din dhalane ke baad gaanv kii taraf bad aate hai
 They not only waste crops but have also crushed people and huts in villages
 maine kheti ke liye ek talab banaaya tha lekin haathiyon ne use barbaad kar diya
 'twenty-five people are needed to drive elephants away
 ham aag jalaakar unhen bhagaate hai
 But elephants come again when they want to
 khadgpur diviginal forest officer anjan guha kehete hai haathiyon se sabase zyada nuksaan kheti or kisaanon ko ho rahaa he
 Lack of adequate food for them in the forest may be one reason behind elephants turning to the village
 is ilaake main lagbhag 200 hathi hai jinamein se 140 ghumantu hai
 These elephants come to the city from the forests of Dalma
 sthaneey kisaan in haathiyon ke aatank se trast ho chuke hai
 MLA from Midnapore Shrikant Mahato says that over time people have learned to deal with the problem of elephants
 ab jab bhi haathiyon kaa jhund hamalaa karata he log zyada sangathit hokar unka muqabla karte hai or unhen bhagane main kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 People burn elephants and firecrackers to drive away elephants
 sarkaar ne is samasya se nipatane ke liye mobile team or hulla dal banaae hai
 We are also taking help of Forest Department officials
 haathiyon se muthbhed gaanvvaalon ke liye koi nai baat nahin he
 Local resident Ranjit Rana says, elephants have been terrorized here for years
 kai logon ne haathiyon ke hamalon main apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Anjan Guha says that the government is serious about this problem
 unhone kaha, 'hamane paanch saal pehle mayoorajharna hathi abhyaaran shuru karne kii yojana banaai thi
 The purpose of this plan was to keep elephants confined to the forest
 hamen ummid he is saal is yojana ko manjuuri mil jaaegi
 And we will be able to make this sanctuary in the next five-seven years
 van vibhaag ke survey ke mutabik pashchim bengal main van kshetra main 1
 There has been an increase of 3%
 haalanki isane haathiyon ke kheton main ghusane par lagaam nahin lag saki
 While discussing the reason behind the increasing elephant attacks, Anjan Guha explains, 'elephants come here from the jungles of neighboring states of Jharkhand and Dalma
 hamane yah bhi dekha he ki ab ye hathi padosi rajya oreisha kii taraf bhi bad rahe hai
 Elephants are getting food in our area
 vahiin duusare rajyon main jangalon kii kataai or khanan ke kaaran bhi hathi vahaan se duusari jagahon par palaayan kar rahe hai

 Lalu Prasad Yadav's party joining hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal was necessary for Nitish and was also considered a game changer, but Jungle Raj's reputation is being so often that he is now trying to improve the image

 Kejriwal has already said that PM Modi is playing the mistakes before the Delhi elections

 ' Meanwhile, the Punjab Police has clarified that it has only one prisoner in its jail who has been convicted in Gujarat, but the state government cannot take any decision regarding the release of prisoners serving life imprisonment due to Supreme Court ban

 ' uttar pradesh police dwaara devband main 2001 se lekar 2017 ke darmiyaan bane sabhi passport ke dobaaraa veriphication ke maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 While many local people consider this step important for safety, in Deoband, many people are raising their voice against this campaign and are describing it as a disturbing step
 police dwaara devband main kii jane vaali is muhim ko lekar devband ke bijepi nagar adhyaksh ne ek bada bayaan dete hue yahaan tak kah diya ki devband aatankwaad kaa adda he
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, local BJP leader in Deoband Gajraj Rana said that Deoband has become a den of terrorists in particular and during the previous government the passports of Bangladeshi and Pakistanis were made here
 bijepi ke netaa kaa kahana he ki 2014 se hi unhone maang kii thi ki devband main bane sabhi passport kaa dobaaraa veriphication kiya jaae
 Talking to Aaj Tak during the panchayat, local resident of Deoband Rohit Singhal said that this is just a conspiracy to defame Deoband
 rohit singhl kaa kahana he ki bina police kii jaanch ke passport nahin miltaa
 If there was a mistake in the first verification, then it is the fault of the police
 logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Actually, passport was recovered by UP ATS terrorist Abdullah arrested from Deoband which was made in Deoband
 aise main yah bhi ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki kahin devband main avaidh tareeke se bangladeshi naagarik yaa bahari tatv to nahin rah rahe hai jinka sambandh aatankwaadiyon ke saath ho
 Under this, the police is preparing to launch a big campaign to do passport verification again
 chunki maamle ko dharm vishesh se jodakar dekha ja rahaa tha isliye hamane devband ke daarul ulum jakaaria madrasa ke mufti mohammad sharif khan se baatcheet kii jinhone passport ke veriphication ke masale par kaha, "jo aatankwaadi giraftaar kiye gaye unka link devband se he
 Even our Home Minister does not believe this and it is wrong to say that terrorists are related to Deoband or Madrasas of Deoband
 "mufti sharif khan ne sawaal uthaaya or kaha, "kya passport sirf devband se banaaya gaya tha yaa or koi shahar bhi the jahaan par banaae gaye the? hamane akhabaaron main dekha he jo unhone kaha he ki ri-veriphication sirf devband main hoga
 "mufti Sharif Khan of Deoband said 'aaj Tak' about this step being taken by the police," This means that there is a shortage of people in your department
 us samay jo veriphication kiya gaya tha vah sahi nahin kiya gaya tha
 When already the verification is not correct, then where will be correct in re-verification? When we asked him why he objected to this action being taken by the police, the Mufti replied, "we have objections to anything Is not
 aap devband kaa naam lekar jo kar rahe hai us par aapatti he
 If you did the verification on the basis of doubt without naming, then there was no problem
 vah sahi tha
 Now when you have taken the name, it means that there are terrorists living here, then it is wrong
 main nahin kah saktaa ki jaanboojhkar torget kar rahe hai yaa nahin bas, itnaa kah saktaa hum jo kiya he vah galat he
 "deobandepulis sources told Aaj Tak that they have not yet recovered the list with passport number and names from the headquarters
 police ke saamne yah badi chunauti he ki agar veriphication ke dauraan logon ke paas aadhaar card or voter card samet sabhi dastavej maujuud hue to aise main vah avaidh tareeke se rah rahe bangladeshiyon kii pahchaan kaise karenge kyonki sambhaavnaaen aisi bhi hai unke paas passport kii tarah hi baaki ke dastavej bhi maujuud hon
 Along with the police, the team of local intelligence unit will also be involved in the re-verification work
 police ke sutron kaa kahana he ki ri-veriphication ke dauraan aapraadhik record vaale sabhi logon kii pahchaan badi hi aasaani se kar lee jaaegi kyonki unka record police ke paas maujuud he
 Also, foreign nationals living in Deoband can also be investigated
 philhal devband police ke paas ri-veriphication ke liye passport kii list nahin pahunchi he
 If sources are to be believed, this campaign can be started on Tuesday or Wednesday
 dekhnaa yah he ki police 17 saalon main bane hue hajarompassportki ri-veriphication ko kaise anjaam degi or saath hi yah muhim or kitne vivaad khadaa karegi
 Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti has refused to resign from his post, dismissing allegations of tampering of evidence in a corruption case
 unhone daawa kiya he ki in aaropon main koi sachai nahin he
 He was trying not to tamper with the evidence but to strengthen it further
 darasal, angreji akhbaar 'times of india' main mangalvaar ko ek khabar chhapi jiske mutabik 2013 main sibiai ne vakil somnath bharti par bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main sabooton ke saath chhedchhad karne or abhiyojan paksh ke gavaah ko prabhavit karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In this regard, the special CBI court of Patiala House Court had also reprimanded Somnath Bharti
 aaropon ko bakawaas qaraar dete hue somnath bharti ne kaha, 'akhbaar main jo khabar chhapi he wo galat he
 This is completely untrue
 pataa nahin mujhase tathyon kii jaanch kiye bina akhbaar ko aisi khabar chhapane kii jaldi kyon thi
 This is the case of the State Bank of Mysore, where the 116 crore scam took place

 vijalence department ne sabake khilaaf aarope tay karne kaa nirdesh diya tha par pataa nahin kis vajah se sibiai ne sirf pawan kumaar ko aaropee banaaya
 During the hearing of the case in 2013, no witnesses came on five dates
 bies divakar bhi is cese main gavaah the
 So my client Pawan Kumar spoke to BS Diwakar on 16 February 2013 over the phone
 is dauraan meri bhi baatcheet hui
 i have a full transcript of that conversation
 ham court ke saamne sach laana chaahate the
 During the conversation with me BS Diwakar made many shocking revelations
 hamane court main is sidi ko on record laane ke liye arji di thi
 During this time, the CBI applied to cancel Pawan Kumar's bail and the matter of that important CD was suppressed in the whole process
 'haalanki, somnath bharti ne court dwaara fatkaar lagaae jane kii baat se inkaar nahin kiya
 He said, 'it was wrong to blame me for pressurizing the witness and tampering with the evidence
 jaj ne galat tippanee kii thi
 "what is the allegation? The CBI alleged that Pawan Kumar and his lawyer Somnath spoke to the prosecution witness over phone over the corruption case
" iske baad sibiai kii vishesh adaalat kii jaj bamba ne kaha ki yah bahut aapattijanak (haili objectionable) or aniatik (an-athical) he
 Not only this, the case also links to the attempt to tamper with the evidence
 tab adaalat ne pawan kumaar ko bel dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Pawan then filed bail pleas through lawyers Somnath Bharti and Prashant Bhushan in the Delhi High Court and later in the Supreme Court, but did not get any relief

 aam aadmi party (AAP) ke baagi vidhayak kapil mishra ne apane vidhansabha kii sadsyta radd hone ke faisle ko dilli hai court main chunauti di he
 Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goyal disqualified him on July 31 under the defection law for anti-party activities
 kapil mishra ne is faisle ko hai court main chunauti dene ja rahe hai
 Mishra's petition is likely to be heard in the High Court soon
 apni yachika main kapil mishra ne kaha ki vidhansabha adhyaksh ne unhen apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka nahin diya
 The Speaker did not even give an opportunity to cross-examine his witnesses
 unhen ayogy tehraae jane ke faisle main supreme court ke disha-nirdeshon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya he
 In the petition, Mishra said that the way he has been disqualified from the Legislative Assembly is against justice and the Speaker of the Assembly disqualified him in a non-constitutional manner
 mishra ne apni daleel di ki unhone party ke kisi aadesh kaa ulanghan bhi nahin kiya or na hi jari kii gai kisi bhi vip ko todaa
 Thus, the Speaker's decision to disqualify him from membership is unconstitutional
 mishra ne hai court se faisla nirast karne kii maang uthaai
 Explain that during the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Speaker of Delhi Assembly canceled his membership on Kapil Mishra as the basis for campaigning for BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vidhansabha adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki aisa lagata he ki kapil mishra ne apni mul raajnneetik party AAP kii sadsyta chhod di he
 Kapil Mishra had also shared the stage against the Aam Aadmi Party with bjp's Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari and the then Union Minister Vijay Goel
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj kii shikaayat ke baad hi vidhansabha adhyaksh ne unki sadsyta radd kar di thi
 Bhardwaj demanded Mishra to be disqualified
 kapil mishra ke baad ab aap ke baagi vidhayak anil vaajapeyi, devendra saharaavat par bhi sadsyta radd hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he

 It comes in two color options
 pehla jed blike or doosraa orora blue
 We have been given Aurora Blue color for review
 iskaa back panel karvd he or hold karne ke liye behatar he
 However, small-handed people may have some problem handling it with one hand
 baaki camera bamp itani aasaani se pataa nahin chalata he, kyonki ye kaaphi had tak antar he
 But one problem is that you will need to use the cover with it, because fingerprints are easily placed on the back panel
 baaki phone kaaphi halkaa he, joki ek acchhee baat he
 Here the power button is given in the right side, as well as the SIM tray is also present in the right
 yahaan keval sim ke liye hi saport diya gaya he

 Here you get Always On Display, however only missed call alert, SMS and Clock can be seen in it
 parformens kii baat karen to ye thik Realme x jaisaa hi he
 This smartphone also has Snapdragon 710 processor just like Realme's phone and the result is the same
 yahaan ap swimming se lekar multi tasking jaise kaam badi hi aasaani se kiye ja sakate hai
 Also, Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG Mobile can also be played with great fun through this smartphone

 HDR and white balance are also better in daylight

 Some of the photos are fine in this but the resolution is low and there are also light noises
 acchhee baat ye he ki indoor artificial liting main iskaa camera behatar clic karata he
 Talking about portrait shots, the edge perfection is up to 80 percent correct
 lekin skin tone jaraa sa badla hua lagata he
 The chroma boost of the real phone is given here under the name Dazzle Color, this helps in boosting the color
 saath hi yahaan google lens ko bhi ek opshan kii tarah aid kiya gaya he, ye behatar he
 Talking about selfie, there is no shutter lag here and bokeh effect is good in portraits

 The Supreme Court has given a big blow to the BJP and BS Yeddyurappa, who have formed the government in Karnataka
 adaalat ne shanivaar shaam 4 baje se pehle floor test kaa aadesh diya he
 Earlier, Governor Vajubhai Vala administered the oath to the Yeddyurappa government, giving 15 days time for the majority test
 aise main ab karnataka main number game kaaphi ahm ho gaya he
 What is the party position now? Elections have been held for 222 seats in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 yani bahumat ke liye 112 siton kii jarurat hogi
 104 BJP mlas have won
 jedies ke 37 or congress ke 78 vidhayak or 3 anya jeet kar aae hai
 That is, BJP will still need 8 mlas to prove majority
 lekingedieske kumaraswami do siton se jitkar vidhayak bane hai
 In such a situation, he will have to resign from one seat
 to phir 221 seat ke lihaaj se bijepi ko 111 siton kii jarurat padegibahumat sabit karne ke liye
 Many Congress mlas are not in touch, amidst the manipulations of the Congress, the Congress and JDS have taken their mlas in a bus to Hyderabad hotel
 congress or jedies kaa daawa he ki unke paas 115 vidhayak hai
 Only one MLA is not present with Anand Singh
 haalanki, unke samarthan patr kaa daawa bhi congress kar rahi he
 Where will 7 mlas come from BJP? On the other hand BJP is claiming that it has majority
 party ke is daawey ke peeche kai atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 This can only happen when many Congress and JDS mlas remain absent during the floor test
 ye sankhya bhi kam se kam 14 honi chahie
 Only then will the majority be judged on the basis of 207 seats i
e
 on the basis of presence of so many members in the assembly
 lekin bijepi ye sthiti kaise banaaegi isapar sabaki najar hogi
 The BJP is eyeing the JDS and some Congress mlas to get the magic number required for bjp's accession to the Lingayat mlas of the Congress
 jinhen floor test ke dauraan sadan se gaiyrhaazir rakhkar bijepi apane liye sthiti anukool bana sakati he
 According to speculation, 7 Congress mlas coming from Lingayat community may remain absent
 kyonki karnataka main lingayat or vokkaliga samudaay ke bich adaavat kii kahani puraani he
 The Congress wants to bring Kumaraswamy to the post of CM, who are from the Vokkaliga community
 yediurppa lingayat samudaay se aate hai or lagaataar lingayat mathon ke jariye congress ke lingayat vidhayakon ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 These can also be kingmakers, apart from this, BJP is also eyeing two independent mlas and one BSP MLA

 The government there does not say whether they consider all Rohingya Muslims to be terrorists
 myanmar kii sarkaar khud hi kahati he ki rohingya aatankwaadi sanghathan ko saudi jihadi madad karte hai
 Now nobody asks who are these Saudi jihadis, do they find shelter in Saudi Arabia who are spreading terrorism in this poor area of myanmar
 tab duniya us saudi arab se kyon nahin baat karti he, jiske saath har duusare din koi na koi raashtra pramukh bijness ke liye khadaa hota he
 This is obviously Myanmar's excuse
 vahaan kii sarkaar ko kahana chahie ki kya ve sabhi 11 lakh rohingya musalamaanon ko aatankwaadi maanati he
 International newspapers such as the Guardian Telegraph New York Times have reported much from the Bangladesh border
 jaan bachaakar aae rohingya musalamaanon ne bataaya he ki kis tarah sena gaanvon ko gher kar jala de rahi he
 He is firing bullets from a helicopter
 bacchon ko maar rahi he
 Myanmar's government has prevented poor Rohingya from reaching all kinds of help to Muslims
 sarkaar or ang saan su chi kaa kahana he ki ye sanghathan aatankwaad failaa rahe hai
 Terrorism spreads in the world by giving food and medicine to hungry thirsts or by giving guns and bombs
 su chi ko bataanaa chahie ki rohingya mukti sena ko hathiyaar koun desh de rahaa he
 This violence has also brought a violent face of Buddhist society as a symbol of peace and logic
 rohingya sirf 'sena banaam rohingya' kii ladaai main nahin fanse hai, ve buddha samaaj ke saath sampradayik hinsa ke bhi bhent chadhe hai
 a riot broke out after the rape and murder of a Rohingya woman in 2012, when one and a quarter million Rohingya Muslims had to flee the country

 Myanmar continues to surround and kill Rohingya Muslims

 The Indian Express reported that 86 Hindus along with Muslims have been killed on August 27 and 28
 bangladesh hindu, buddhist, chrishchiyan unity council ke rana dasgupta ne kaha he ki kareeb 510 hinduon ne bangladesh ke kaks bazaar main sharan lee he
 In a country where the record of human rights is poor, people are killed, not only Hindus and Muslims, whose turn the government crushes
 isliye tay karnaa hoga ki hamen myanmar ke rohingya musalamaanon ko sirf musalamaanon kii nazar se dekhnaa he yaa maanavadhikaar kii nazar se
 Have we become so communal now that there will be no difference in the fact that the army of a country is surrounded by ordinary citizens and blasts it with bullets
 rohingya musalamaanon ko naagarikta bhi hasil nahin he
 The law there would give citizenship to the same Rohingya Muslim who would prove that his great-grandfather came to Myanmar before 1823
 kya koi do sadi pehle kaa record dekar sabit kar saktaa he
 Apparently the government there wants to eliminate this part of the population by killing it

 Till date their children have not got citizenship

 Therefore, we not only need to understand Burma's political developments properly but we should also give moral support to the ongoing struggles for democratic rights there

 Why haven't you condemned it yet? america ke videsh sachiv boris johnson ne ang saan su chi ko chetavanee di he ki ve rohingya musalamaanon tak madad pahunchane se roak kar acha nahin kar kar rahi hai
 No Nobel Prize winners have written to the Nobel Committee to withdraw the Nobel Prize given to Aung San Suu Kyi
 su chi kabhi duniya bhar main shanti or loktantr kaa pratik ke rup main dekhi gayi aaj vahi bhukhe bacchon tak madad nahin pahunchane de rahi hai
 Aung San Suu Kyi's face is exposed
 tippaniyan The problem of seeing refugees is communally colored in many countries of the world not only in India
 hinsa ke khilaaf bolne ke bajaae yahi hinsa chupake-chupake sampradayik soch ko khuraaq pahunchane ke kaam aati he
 As you will see, within Pakistan and Bangladesh, violence against Hindus will be poisoned
 magar ise lekar koi mantri yaa pradhanmantri ke str se bayaan nahin aayega
 If we want, we can continue to see it like this, but we will see a little change that every community is being killed under every government
 pakistan main shiyaon par jo hamale hue hai ve bhi kam bhayanak nahin hai
 a large number of Shia doctors have been killed
 duniya ke kai deshon main sharnaarthiyon ko sharan dene ke maamle main bahes chal rahi he
 France, America and Germany
 germany ne to lakhon kii sankhya main sharnaarthiyon ko sharan di he
 There are 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in India
 grih rajya mantri kiran rijiju ke bayaan par vivaad ho rahaa he ki ye sab avaidh hai or inhen baahar nikaala janaa chahie
 Whereas the guidelines say that whoever falls victim to religious persecution will be given refugee status
 gardian telegraph neuyark times jaise antarrashtriya akhbaaron main bangladesh kii seemaa se kaaphi reporting hui he
 Rohingya Muslims who have come to save their lives have told how the army is encircling the villages and burning them

 Killing children
 myanmar kii sarkaar ne garib rohingya musalamaanon tak har tarah kii madad pahunchane se roak di he
 The government and Aung San Suu Kyi say that these organizations are spreading terrorism
 bhukhe pyaason ko khaanaa or dawa dekar duniya main aatankwaad failata he yaa bandook or bam dekar failata he
 Suu Kyi should tell who is giving weapons to the Rohingya liberation army
 is hinsa ne shanti or tark ke pratik buddha samaaj kaa bhi ek hinsak cheharaa saamne laayaa he
 The Rohingya are not only caught in the battle of 'army versus Rohingya', they have also been exposed to communal violence with Buddhist society
 2012 main rohingya aurat ke saath balaatkaar or hatya ke baad danga bhadkaa to vahaan se sava lakh rohingya musalamaanon ko desh chhodkar bhaagna padaa tha
 To surround and kill them, the Myanmar government has removed a large number of people from the Buddhist community from there
 myanmar lagaataar rohingya musalamaanon ko gher kar maar rahaa he
 You are thinking that if nothing is happening with the Hindus present there, it is wrong
 indian express main khabar chhapi he ki 27 or 28 agast ko musalamaanon ke saath-saath 86 hinduon ko bhi maar diya gaya he
 Rana Dasgupta of the Buddhist Hindu Christianity Council, a Bangladesh Hindu, has said that about 510 Hindus have taken refuge in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar
 jis desh main maanavadhikaar kaa record karaab hota he, vahaan janata maari jaati he, hindu or musalmaan hi nahin, jisaki baari aati he sarkaar kuchal detii he
 That is why we have to decide whether to look at the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar from the point of view of Muslims or from the point of view of human rights
 kya ham ab itane sampradayik ho chuke hai ki is baat se fark hi nahin padegaa ki kisi desh kii sena aam nagarikon ko gher kar yun hi goliyon se uda de rahi he
 Rohingya Muslims do not even have citizenship
 vahaan ke kanoon se usee rohingya musalmaan ko naagarikta milegi jo sabit karegaa ki uske pardada 1823 se pehle myanmar aae the
 Can anyone prove it by giving a record of two centuries ago
 zaahir he vahaan kii sarkaar aabaadi ke is hisse ko maar kar khatm kar dena chaahati he
 India has a special relationship with Myanmar

 2012 main jab purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne burma kii yatra kii thi tab prakaash ke re ne apane blog bargad par ek lekh likhaa- a large number of indentured laborers were taken to slavery under British rule in the same Burma and could not return
 aaj tak unki santanon ko naagarikta nahin mili he
 They are undergoing terrible exploitation and torture

 Sui Chi, once seen as a symbol of peace and democracy all over the world, today is not allowing the same help to the hungry children
 ang saan su chi kaa cheharaa benakaab ho gaya he
 The comments sharnaarthiyon ko dekhne kii samasya par sampradayik rang bharat hi nahin duniya ke kai deshon main chadha diya jaataa he
 Instead of speaking out against violence, this violence secretly serves to feed communal thinking
 jaise aap dekhenge ki bheetar-bheetar pakistan or bangladesh main hinduon ke prati hinsa par zehar failaayaa jayega
 But there will be no statement from the level of any minister or prime minister about it
 ham chahen to ise aise hi dekhte rah sakate hai lekin thodaa badlaav kar dekhenge ki har sarkaar ke neeche har samudaay maaraa ja rahaa he
 The attacks on Shias in Pakistan are no less terrible
 badi sankhya main shiya doctoron ko maar diya gaya he
 There is a debate in many countries of the world about the issue of giving refuge to refugees
 france, america or germany tak
 Germany has given refuge to millions of refugees
 bharat main 40,000 rohingya musalmaan rah rahe hai
 There is a dispute over Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju's statement that these are illegal and should be thrown out
 jabaki disha-nirdesh yah kehete hai ki jo bhi dharmik pratadna kaa shikaar hokar aayega use sharnarth kaa darja diya jayega
 This violence has also brought a violent face of Buddhist society as a symbol of peace and logic

 a senior minister in the BJP government led by Manohar Parrikar in Goa has said that girls going to pubs in short dresses is against local culture and should be discontinued

 ' Sunil Subrahmanyam, the manager of the Indian team caught in an abuse case in the West Indies, has been asked to return home
 subrahmanyam ko disambar 2018 main australia ke perth test ke dauraan apane kharaab ke vyavhaar ke kaaran aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha, haalanki vah vahaan baad main batch gaye the
 It remains to be seen whether Subrahmanyam will get a chance to appear in Mumbai on August 16 to interview the administrative manager, who was selected for it after the layoffs
 board ke ek adhikari ne ieenes se kaha ki manager kii bhoomika ke liye yah dekhnaa jaruri he ki kya unhen isaki ijaajat di jaaegi yaa unhen is pad se hataaya jayega
 It depends on how the officers take their argument after they return home
 lekin yah pehali baar nahin he jab yah bhartiya team manager ke rup main unke khilaaf durvyavhaar kii baat ai he
 The former Tamil Nadu spinner is said to have offered an unconditional apology for his alleged misconduct with officials of the Indian High Commission in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, but the incident is sure to lose him the post with the national team
 board ke varisht adhikari ne kaha, 'bhartiya team kii jal sarankshan pariyojna ke liye kaaphi lambii shooting thi or unhen isaki dekharekh kerani thi
 At the end of this shooting, he was sent an e-mail asking him to return with the first flight
 ' bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ne do ucchayog ko kaha tha ki carabia main jis vigyaapan ko filmana he, uske liye vah team ke manager subrahmanyam se sampark karen, lekin jab trinidad evam tobaago main maujuud bhartiya ucchayog ke adhikariyon ne subrahmanyam se sampark kiya to unhone adhikariyon ko tavajjo nahin di
 Former coach of Ravichandran Ashwin, Subrahmanyam has played 74 first-class matches and taken 285 wickets
 isse pehle bisisiai ke ek kaaryakari ne kaha tha ki pehle is tarah kii harkaton ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya, isi kaaran yah sthiti bani he
 He said that if the matter was not of the High Commission and the COA chief Vinod Rai did not come on board, then this time also this incident would have been ignored
 unhone kaha, 'pehle is tarah kii harakatein hui thim, lekin unhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 This is why he is encouraged
 ab kyonki raay tak baat aa gai he to karrwai kii ja sakati he
 The Board officials were not happy with his behavior even during the World Cup
 pataa chalaa he ki subrahmanyam ne apane kathith durvyavhaar ke liye tanaav ko jimmedaar bataaya
 "in his apology, he said that he had not completed sleep and was under stress, which led to him behaving in this manner
" unhone bina shart maafee maang lee he
 But you have to understand that this matter has reached to the high level government officials and the BCCI cannot do much on this matter
 'ullekhneey he ki 52 saal ke subrahmanyam par aarope tha ki vah varisht sarkari adhikariyon ke phone kii lagaataar andekhi kar rahe the
 Then he did not even pick up the phones of BCCI officials
 bataaya jaataa he ki trinidad evam tobago main bhartiya ucchayog ke varisht vyakti ne unase sahyog kii maang kii to unhone unase kaha ki mujhe baar-baar sandesh mat bhejo

 But in all this, there was a launching of interesting perfumes
 maharashtra ke pokhari gaanv ko ek varsh pehle khule main shouch mukt ghoshit kiya gaya tha, jahaan kuch anya pichhadi jati ke log bhi rahete hai or unka daawa he ki unhen khule main shouch karne ke liye baadhya hona pad rahaa he, kyonki unhen shauchalay banane ke liye abhi dhanrashi nahin mili he
 The Ganges Sai living on the outskirts of Pokhari is partially paralyzed
 unki ekmaatr ichha yah he ki unke ghar main bhi shauchalay ho taaki unhen khule main shouch ke liye nahin janaa pade
 The village was declared open defecation free last year under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious Clean India Mission
 haalanki saay or gaanv ke aakhri chor par rahane vaale pichhadi jati ke kuch anya pariwaron kaa daawa he ki ve abhi bhi shauchalay kii suvidha se vanchit hai
 The comments saay kahati hai, 'oonchi jati ke kisaanon ne apane gharon main shauchalay banavaa liye hai, lekin ham khud se shauchalay nahin bana sakate
 'however, Sarpanch Amol Kakade dismissed these claims, saying that 47 families living in the said township had actually encroached on government land and were not considered part of the village
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) pokhari ke bahari hisse main rahane vaali ganga saay aanshik rup se lakwagrast he
 Their only wish is to have a toilet in their house so that they do not have to go for open defecation
 gaanv ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvakankshi svachh bharat mishan ke tahat gat varsh khule main shouch se mukt ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 However, Say and some other backward caste families living at the end of the village claim that they are still denied toilet facilities
 tippaniyan Sai says, 'upper caste farmers have built toilets in their homes, but we cannot build toilets by ourselves
 ' haalanki, sarpanch amol kakde ne in daavon ko yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki ukt basti main rahane vaale 47 pariwaron ne vastav main sarkari jameen par atikaraman kiya he or ve gaanv kaa hissaa nahin maane jate

 ) Happy Eid
 har naatedaaron kii tarah damaad bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 a good son-in-law and a bad son-in-law
 jammu main pradhanmantri ne ek good damaad kii tarif karte hue kisi bed damaad kii taraf ishaara kiya he to sawaal uthne lage ki agar bed damaad kii baat he to bhrashtachar or parivaarwaad par unke maanak kya hai
 What have they done differently
 raajnneeti kaa ek sadabahaar vishay he parivaarwaad, is par baaten hi hoti hai, hota kuch nahin
 Girdhari Lal Dogra, was finance minister in Jammu and Kashmir for 27 years and got the opportunity to present the budget 26 times
 neshnal conference or congress main jivan bhar rahe girdhaari laal dogra ke damaad hai bijepi ke varisht netaa or vitt mantri arun jetali
 Prime Minister Modi, Finance Minister Jaitley, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also attended the birth centenary celebrations of Girdhari Lal Dogra
 ek congressi netaa kii janmashti par aisa samagam raajnneeti kaa ek durlabh or sukhad kshan to he hi, lekin vitt mantri arun jetali girdhaari laal ji ke damaad na hote to kya aisa sangam hota
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that Girdhari Lal Dogra, who was always a Congressman, could not build a house for himself even after presenting 26 budget
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek baat marke kii kahi na to girdharilal ji ne apane damaad ko vichaardhaara badal apane paale main aane ke liye kaha na damaad ne apane sasur ke rasookh kaa koi istamaal kiya
 Both of them went on different paths with their deeds
 yaheen par kehete-kehete pradhanmantri halke andaaz main kah gaye ki aaj to ham jaanate hai ki damaadon ke kaaran kya-kya baaten hoti hai
 Everyone laughed but the Congress felt that the Prime Minister had commented on Robert Vadra
 bas bachaav or hamalaa shuru hote hi baat parivaarwaad par pahunch gai
 Shakeel Ahmed said that one should not talk personally
 modi ji bhi kisi ke damaad honge
 Before that the Prime Minister said that not a single picture in the pictures on Girdhari Lal Dogra has his family
 sirf antim sanskaar ke vakt kii tasviir main parivaar dikhataa he
 This thing touched his mind
 pradhanmantri kii is baat par main apni tippanee karnaa chahta hum
 Have we assumed that the ideal leader is the one who keeps his family away
 yah kahaan or kab sabit hua he
 In this context, President Obama would be very bad who appears in public with his families
 raajnneeti ko sanyas samaj lenaa ajeeb tark he
 In the US, Hillary Clinton, wife of former President Bill Clinton, is going to contest the presidential election
 bush khandaan se ek or raashtrapati banane ke liye aa gaye hai
 The new one is named Jab Bush
 har loktantr main parivaarwaad ek nasoor ban chukaa he
 With the help of these generations, the relationship between politicians and corporate has also started at the family level
 agar sab maanate he ki parivaarwaad nasoor he to kya hamaare netaaon yaa dalon main saahas he ki parivaarwaad yaa damaadvaad ke kilaaf morcha khol den
 Everybody keeps this issue positive, so that in the weak time, it will be useful to lob
 hamaara loktantr chand pariwaron kii giraft main aa gaya he
 This is a big problem, but the meaning of familism must also be understood openly
 parivaarwaad kii buniyaad sirf Is not based on the relationship of khandani and khoon
 kai baar kaarobaari or dostana vajahon se bhi paariwarik rishta ban jaataa he
 Just like Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje's family relationship with Lalit Modi, sometimes parts of the industry have such an impact on the government that we start calling it crony capitalism instead of family
 kroni capitalism kaa matlab kuch logon ke samooh kaa puunji or satta par niyantran While Robert Vadra is an example, the name of the son-in-law of Time Vajpayee of NDA One was also taken in such contexts
 vyaapman jaise ghotaale main ek alag kism kaa parivaarwaad dikhataa he to 2ji ghotaale main aapane ek khaas kism kaa parivaarwaad dekha hi
 On April 7, Rukmani Srinivasan wrote in a report in the Hindu newspaper that 130 of our mps come from political clans
 loksabhaa main samaajawaadee party 100 percent paariwarik party heandhra pradesh kii tidipi ke 44 fisadi saansad raajnneetik pariwaron se aate hai
 The lowest dynastic type of MP comes from Jayalalithaa's party

 girdharilal dogra, jammu-kashmir main 27 saal tak vitt mantri rahe or 26 baar bajet pesh karne kaa mauka mila
 Senior BJP leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is the son-in-law of Girdhari Lal Dogra, who lives in the National Conference and Congress
 girdharilal dogra kii janmashatabdi kaarykram main pradhanmantri modi, vitt mantri jetali, mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said or congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne bhi shirkat kii
 Such a meeting on the birth centenary of a Congress leader is a rare and happy moment of politics, but if Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was not the son-in-law of Girdhari Lalji, what would have been such a confluence
 congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne kaha ki sadaa congressi rahe girdharilal dogra ji 26 bajet pesh karne ke baad bhi apane liye ek ghar nahin bana sake
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said one thing neither Girdhari Lal ji asked his son-in-law to change his ideology to his court, nor did the son-in-law use any influence of his father-in-law
 donon apane apane karmon se alag-alag raste par chale
 While saying this, the Prime Minister said lightly that today we know what things happen due to sons-in-law

 Just like Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje's family relationship with Lalit Modi, sometimes parts of the industry have such an impact on the government that we start calling it crony capitalism instead of family
 kroni capitalism kaa matlab kuch logon ke samooh kaa puunji or satta par niyantran While Robert Vadra is an example, the name of the son-in-law of Time Vajpayee of NDA One was also taken in such contexts

 Stampede in Aurangabad, two children died before a stampede occurred during the Chhath Puja in Aurangabad on Saturday

 The accident took place near Suryakund, the block headquarters
 isse pehle saal 2012 main bhi chhath puja ke dauraan bihar kii rajdhani patna main haadasa hua tha
 During this time the bridge made of bamboo bats was broken
 iske baad bhagdad machane se 18 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Had the set pair of Cheteshwar Pujara and Shikhar Dhawan fielded in the morning on the fourth day in Brisbane, could the result of this test be anything else? chauthe din kaa khel shuru hone se thik pehle hi shikhar dhawan ko abhyaas ke dauraan dahini kalai main chot lag gai thi
 Shikhar Dhawan was not in a position to bat immediately due to injury, seeing that Virat Kohli replaced him with Pujara
 abhyaas ke dauraan kohli ko bhi baayen haath main chot lagi thi, lekin vah maidan main utre
 However, Kohli could not fully meet this challenge
 11 gendon par mahaj ek ran banane ke baad michel johnson kii gend par vah pavilion laut gaye
 The Indian innings collapsed as Kohli was dismissed
 iske baad mahaj 11 ran ke bheetar team india ke teen anya ballebaaj pavilion laut gaye
 On the other hand, after Sh Ashwin was dismissed, Shikhar Dhawan came out to bat and he looked completely set
 unhone na keval apni half centuri puri kii, balki team india ko us score tak pahunchane main kaamyaab rahe, jahaan se bhartiya gendbaazon ke liye thode sangharsh kii gunjaaish bani
 He also made excellent use of the wrist during his innings
 is pari ke saath hi shikhar dhawan ne apane form main vaapasi ke sanket bhi de die hai
 However, he must have been disappointed with himself that he missed a century even after reaching close to a century
 aise main ek sawaal yah uthta he ki agar shikhar dhawan chauthe din cheteshwar pujaara ke saath hi pari shuru karne utarate, to kya team india kii tasviir duusari hoti
 It is very possible that the Indian innings did not falter in the first season
 match samaapti ke baad shen worne se lekar bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni tak ne mana he ki shikhar dhawan kii jagah viraat kohli ke utarane se bhartiya pari kii lay bighad gai
 It has happened, it is possible
 haalanki gaba kii practice pich ko lekar bhartiya team prabandhan ke sawaal ko sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 According to the Indian team management, he had been demanding fresh net practice pitch for the last two days, but it was not completed and the pitch curator gave the un-even bounced pitch for practice
 iske chalate hi shikhar dhawan or viraat kohli chotil hue
 But during the batting of both, it was not felt that he had any serious injury
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bhartiya team prabandhan ne koi oficial shikaayat darj nahin karai he
