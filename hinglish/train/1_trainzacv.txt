is par jawaab dete hue sushamaa ne kaha ki kashmir dwipaksheeya mudda he
 There is no need for any third to interfere in this
 sushamaa ne kaha ki piem shahid khaakaan abbasi ko yaad nahin ki shimla or lahore samjhaute ke antargat ham aapasi masalon ko aapas main sulajhaayenge
 Showing a mirror to Pakistan compared to India, Sushma asked Pakistani leaders to introspect about why India is known as a global IT superpower while Pakistan is identified as a factory of export of terrorism
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki bharat ne iaiti, im or ames jaise bade santhaan banaae hai
 At the same time, Pakistan has put up terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen and Haqqani Network
 paak ke saathi china ko bhi javabsushamaa ne china par apratyaksh rup se nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki kuch desh apane hiton ke liye aatankwaad kaa saath de rahe hai
 According to Sushma, condemning terrorism on an international platform like the United Nations has become a ritual
 kai desh sankalp lene ke baad isapar karrwai karnaa bhul ja rahe hai
 Condemn terrorism but nothing concrete is happening in the name of action
 kai desh apane hit ke liye aatankwaad kaa samarthan de rahe hai
 Sushma said that we should not look at terrorism from a different perspective
 meraa or tumhaara aatankwaad alag naa ho or aatankwaad kii ek hi paribhaasha honi chahie
 The reply was also given in the Right to Reply reply to PM Khaqan's speech immediately before Sushma Swaraj responded to Pakistan
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat kii first secretary inam gambhir ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri shahid khaakaan abbasi ko karaara jawaab diya tha

 Just 8 months after 'love Marriage', the wife was murdered by taking her to Panipat on the pretext of 'long Drive', a millionaire businessman, murdered in a deserted place for 15 days - the daughter-in-law of a respected family in Delhi and a millionaire businessman The wife suddenly disappears
 kaayade se shuruuaati khojbin ke baad jab uskaa koi suraag nahin miltaa
 Then the family members should have written the report of his disappearance to the police
 magar ghar vaale aisa nahin karte
 During this time fifteen days pass
 phir pandrah din baad jo sach saamne aata he, use sun or jaan kar har koi sann rah jaataa he
 Nancy's family members were 20-year-old Nancy Sharma from Janakpuri in Shakadilli, who suddenly disappeared in mysterious ways
 wo naa to apane sasuraal main thi or naa hi maayke main
 For a few days, people did not realize that Nancy had gone somewhere, but when it became difficult to reach Nancy with each passing day, her maternal grandfather suspected
 nancy ke pita ne darj karai firasala main nancy kaa mobile phone bhi uski gumshudagi ke duusare hi din yani pichley 11 november se hi hairaani bhare tareeqe se switchd of aa rahaa tha
 In such a situation it was not possible to reach him despite millions of efforts
 or tab 25 november ko nancy ke pita ne janakapuri thane main apni beti kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai
 Pati Sahil narrated a strange story, since Nancy lived with her husband Sahil, the police first decided to ask Sahil the secret of Nancy's disappearance
 lekin jab sahil se baat hui to usne ajeeb kahani sunai, usne bataaya ki 11 november ke rose achaanak dilli kii ek trephic lite par nancy abhi aati hum kah kar utari or gaayab ho gai
 It is doubtful that Sahil happened during interrogation, this story does not get down from anyone's neck
 lihaaza, police ne nancy ke pati sahil se naa sirf us trephic lite kaa pataa poocha, balki ye bhi poocha ki akhir nancy ke gaayab hone kii khabar usne ab tak police main kyon nahin di? sahil ke paas is sawaal kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin tha
 In such an open murder, the police not only took strict action with Sahil, but also investigated the call details of Sahil's mobile phone and the location of his phone in the last few days
 or bas isi koshish se qatl kaa raaj khul gaya
 Sahil had been talking to a boy named Shubham several times a day for the past few days
 or ittefaq se nancy kii gumshudagi ke rose bhi donon main kai baar baat hui thi
 It was also clear from the investigation of the mobile locationphone that came out of Panipat that on that day Sahil, his wife Nancy and Shubham had also gone towards Panipat together
 aise main ab sahil uske dost shubham ke saamne sach bataane ke sivaay koi chaara nahin tha
 And then both of them admitted that they shot Nancy by deceiving them
 or ab tak qatl kaa raaj chupaane ke liye wo uske trephic lite se apni marzi ke kahin chale jane kii juthi kahani logon ko sunaate rahe
 Nancy's last journey but just eight months after the love marriage, the incident of the murder was as scary and shocking, the plot behind it was equally terrible
 jis din nancy gum hui thi
 Even on that day Nancy had a fight with her husband Sahil
 magar us din ladaai ke baad sahil bahut jaldi sanbhal gaya
 He then convinces Nancy and persuades her to walk on Long Drive to make him happy
 iske baad sahil or nancy dilli se dur panipat ke liye nikal padate hai
 This was the last journey of Nancy's life
 nancy par shaq karata tha sahilsecond hand kaaron kaa kaarobaari sahil chopra or nancy kii mulaakaat ek berth de party main hui thi
 Both fell in love at first sight
 or donon gharavaalon se alag liv-in main rahane lage
 After being together for a few months, both of them got married, but this marriage brought wonders in both of their lives
 lav marij or ek-duusare ke saath rahane ke baavjood sahil nancy par kisi or se rishte kaa shaq karata tha or isi ko lekar donon ke bich jhagade bhi hote the
 a few days after Sahil hatched a dreadful conspiracy, there was a rift between Nancy and Sahil, and the fight between the two became a daily affair
 10 november ko bhi donon ke bich kisi baat ko lekar tikhi nonk-jhonk hui
 But Sahil had already decided to get rid of Nancy
 long drive ke bahaane nancy ko le gaya panipatalihaaza, nonk-jhonk ke baad usne nancy se long drive par chalane kii guzarish kii
 Said that going on long drive will also freshen up his mood
 nancy uski baton main aa gai
 
 
 And both of them left for Panipat with Shubham, a boy working at Sahil
 nancy ne saheli ko kiya tha macejasitam dekhie ki nancy apane pati ke saath panipat ja to rahi thi, lekin use bhi shaq tha ki uske saath koi anhoni ho sakati he, isliye car main baithi-baithi usne mobile se chat karte hue apni ek saheli ko likhaa tha ki wo sahil ke saat panipat ja rahaa he, lekin agar use kuch hua, to samajhnaa ki sahil ne uski jaan le lee he
 Bullet shot in Nancy's head, but Sahil arrived in his true form after reaching Panipat
 vahaan apane saathi shubham ke saath mil kar sahil ne apni hi bivi nancy ke sir main goli maar di or laash panipat rifinary ke paas sunsaan jagah par phenk diya
 However, apart from Sahil and Shubham, a boy named Badal was also involved in this murder, who helped in the murder
 laash jalaane kii koshishnansy kii jaan lene ke baad qaatilon ne uski laash jalaane kii bhi koshish kii, taaki uski pahchaan naa ho sake
 
 
 Incidentally, see that the gun with which Sahil shot his wife Nancy, that gun was also made by Nancy itself
 yani anjaane main usne khud hi apni maut kaa saamaan ikattha kiya tha, jisase uske pati ne uski jaan le lee
 Three arrested, including a murderous husband, but when on suspicion the police caught Nancy's husband Sahil, his changing statements and mobile phone call details and location gave him a lie
 ab police ne is maamle main sahil ke saath-saath uske donon saathiyon ko bhi giraftaar kar liya he
 But the bloody love story of a millionaire businessman in Delhi has shocked everyone

 After 'kaminey', the pair of Vishal Bhardwaj and Shahid Kapoor are going to be seen again with 'haider'
 wiliam shakespeare ke dukhaant naatakon main se ek ‘hamelet’ ko ‘haidar’ kaa swaroop dekar vishaal ne isaki traasadee ko ek arse se traasadiyon se guzar rahe kashmir kii khubasurat vaadiyon main piroyaa he
 Conversation with Shahid Kapoor, playing the role of Hyder: How difficult was it to be Hyder? It is really hard when you play a complex character like Haider that has multiple layers
 ‘haidar’ un filmon main se nahin he jisamen aapane apane dialogs sahi bol die to aapkaa kaam khatm ho gaya
 There were many such things here which were untold, there were also many lines in four lines which i had to tell from my emotion
 aap dekhenge is film main mere chaar luks hai jo ek pita kii khoj main lage bete kii daastaan bayaan karte hai
 To be fair, during this journey of my son 'hyder', who was searching for his lost father, there were many occasions when i could not convince myself of my performance
 main aksar poochta rahata tha ‘yah shot thik to he naa’
 What does Vishal Bhardwaj's films like? The biggest feature of Vishal's films is his strong heroines
 ab ‘haidar’ ko hi lijie
 The film is a story of his father's son Haider, but Shraddha and Tabu's character in it is quite impressive
 sach kahuun to apni filmon main auraton ko itnaa bada sthaan dena vishaal sar kii sabase badi khubi he
 i don't think there is any filmmaker in the entire film industry besides Vishalji who gives so many opportunities to women
 mujhe yaad he ‘kamine’ main priyanka ke mahaz 8 seen the lekin us 8 seen ko jis khubsuurati se vishaal sar ne gadha tha vah aaj bhi yaadgaar he
 How was my experience working with Tabu? She has become my mother but our relationship is not the same as it usually is between every mother and son
 film main hamaara maa bete kaa sambandh kaaphi pechida he
 Actually life is like this, there are two and not four, often five and Vishal sir through his films tells the reality of life
 vishaal sar kii koshish rahati ki vah ek aisa sansar rache jisamen baithkar hamen lage ki vaah ham kuch aisi hi duniya ke bare main soch rahe the
 If i say this, it would not be wrong that every relation shown in 'haider' is quite complex in this way, it has many layers and that is its beauty
 sirf ek din kii shooting ke liye apane khubasurat baalo kii bali dena thik tha?yaqiin kiijie aaj jab yah film puri ho chuki he or mujhe iske liye dheron tarifen mil rahi he to mujhe khud par garv ho rahaa he ki main ‘haidar’ kaa hissaa hum
 'haider' has not only helped me to become a better actor but this film also made me fearless that i could be bald for just one day's shooting
 main samajhataa hum is tarah ke faisle lenaa har kisi ke liye mushkil he
 Initially i was also scared but then i told myself, whatever i want to say, i have liked this story, my director has this demand, so i will definitely do it
 haalanki us dauraan mujhe kai logon ne prosthetic mek ap kii salaah di or main yah kar bhi saktaa tha lekin vah bahut nakli hota or logon kii nazar main aa jaataa
 Now i can say this with full conviction that 'haider' is indeed a film for which you can be bald even for an hour of shooting
 ‘haidar’ ‘baing baing’ ke saath aa rahi he koi dabaav?dabaav kis baat kaa? jin dinon hamaari film release ho rahi he us dauraan paanch din kaa weekend he or yah pehla mauka nahin jab do badi filmein ek saath relies ho rahi hai
 Earlier, 'gadar' and 'lagaan' and 'jab Tak Hai Jaan' and 'son of Sardar' were also released on the same day and all these films earned well at the box office, so 'haider' got 'bang Bang' No need to be afraid of meraa yah bhi maananaa he ki in do filmon main utana hi fark he jitna ki dhoop or chhaanv main hota he
 The things that are in 'haider' are not in 'bang Bang' and the things that the audience will get in 'bang Bang', he cannot expect from 'haider'
 shooting ke dauraan kaa koi mjedaar vakya?shraddha ko ek seen main trephic main maaruti 800 car chalaani thi
 When i asked Shraddha that you would drive a car in such traffic, Shraddha said 'yes, absolutely
 main bahut acchhee driver hum
 'but as soon as Shraddha tried to take the car reverse, the car collided with something loud
 maine unase poocha ki kya hua tum to kah rahi thim ki tum bahut acchhee driver ho to shraddha ne kaha is 1990 kii khatara car se to kisi kaa bhi accident ho jaae
 Everyone laughed at this

 Salman Khan greeting fans congress kii aguwai vaale sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan ke ghatak dal rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ne ishaaron-ishaaron main kaha ki yadi party kaa itihaas dekha jaae to upaadhyaksh pad par rahul gandhi kii tarakkee se congress ke liye or zyada samasyaayein khadi ho sakati hai
 NCP general secretary DP Tripathi said, "whenever there was a serious problem within the Congress party, when it was appointed vice-president, then it only declined
" ’ haalanki, treepathi ne yah jarur kaha ki unhen jaipur main congress ke upaadhyaksh niyukt kiye gaye rahul gandhi se koi samasya nahin he
 He said, 'I am just drawing your attention to the history of the appointment of the Vice President
 ’ensipi netaa ne kaha ki tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh rajeev gandhi or seetaram kesari ke kaarykaal main kramash: arjuna singh or jitendra prasad ko upaadhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya tha
 In response to a question related to the prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 elections, Tripathi said, "if there is Dr
 Manmohan Singh, then surely he will be the prime ministerial candidate
" yadi vah hai to iskaa matlab he ki vah hai
 Tripathi also said that as the leader of the parliamentary party, it is up to the Congress party to forward someone else
 ensipi netaa ne kaha, ‘congress sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii aguva party he
 But till now we are working under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ham unke saath khushi-khushi kaam kar rahe hai
 On the possibility of declaring Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, Tripathi said that the Congress is the largest party in the alliance and it will be the decision of its leader
 yadi koi noujvaan netaa he to yah behatar he
 Asked if the NCP chief has given up aspirations to become Prime Minister, Tripathi said, "pawar saheb is not used to dreaming
" vah hakeekat main yakeen rakhte hai
 The country will decide who will be the Prime Minister
 ’ The demand for the removal of Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the captaincy of the Indian cricket team may be intensifying, but former captain Rahul Dravid believes that there is no option presently and that he will take Team India forward
 dravid ne kaha, ‘philhal mujhe to koi vikalp nahin dikh rahaa
 i believe that Dhoni is the person who will take the Indian team forward because he has energy and passion
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jaise hi jajbaton kaa yah tufaan thamega or aaraam se khilaadi aatmamanthan kar sakenge ki unase kahaan galati hui or bhavishya kii disha kya hogi or bhartiya cricket ko kaise aage le jaaya sakegaa to sab thik ho jaayegaa
 If Dhoni has that passion and energy, i think he is the right person but the decision has to be taken
 ’sunil gavaskar or krishnamachari shrikant jaise purv captainon ne dhoni ko hataane kii maang kii he
 Asked about the future of Sachin Tendulkar, who is struggling with bad form, Dravid said that after introspection, it is for Sachin to take this decision
 unhone kaha, ‘sachin ne khel ko bahut kuch diya he
 He is a great player and it is a difficult period for him
 vah isse aahat bhi hoga
 Need to talk to him to know what he is thinking and what his plans are for the future
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘is baatcheet ke baad use khud kai chizon ke bare main sochna hoga
 If he feels that he can go with the Indian team on the upcoming overseas tours and give his best, it would make sense to support his decision
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yadi use isamen shaq he to use apane karier ke bare main or bhartiya cricket ke bhavishya ke bare main sochna hoga
 He has to take the decision
 ’ unhone kaha ki tendulkar jo bhi faisla le, sabhi ko uskaa sammaan karnaa chaiye
 He said, 'this time is very emotional and he has to think apart emotion
 austrailia ke khilaaf shrinkhalaa main abhi samay he
 Whatever decision we take, we have to respect it
 ’england ke khilaaf bharat ke lachar pradarshan par dravid ne kaha ki team badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he lekin isse behatar pradarshan ho saktaa tha
 He said, 'it is always bad to lose a Test series on our soil
 team badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he lekin pradarshan isse behatar ho saktaa tha
 After the first Test it was felt that India could win the series but it did not happen

 congress ne sarkari dastavejon ko ujagar kar is nae farjivade kaa khulaasa kiya he
 After the disclosure of the case, the Chhattisgarh government has once again joined the daub
 iske saath hi chhattisgarh me gadakari ek baar phir congress ke nishane par aa gayi hai
 The Congress is bursting the effigy of the BJP government in the state for illegal assistance to the Sancheti brothers and the coal mines scam
 pehle to gadakari ke kareebi sancheti bandhuo ko rajya me bagaiyr udyog lagaaye koyala khadaan aavantit kar sarkaar ko 1052 karod kaa chuunaa lagane kaa khulaasa C

 The report was made and the matter had caught the eye of another new revelation
 is naye khulaase me sancheti bandhuo ko pehle to kaamkaaj kii gunavaktaa or duusari vaidhanik aupchaariktaayen puri nahin karne ke chalate chhattisgarh sarkaar ne 17 karod 35 lakh kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 These fines were levied for theft of cell tax
 rajya sarkaar ko jurmaane kii rakam vasuulne ke liye saal bhar lag gayi
 Sancheti brothers had to attach movable and immovable property
 tab jaakar jurmaane kii rakam ke puure 17 karod 35 lakh rupaye sarkari khajaane me jada hue, lekin gadakari ke hastkshep ke baad ek hi jatke main ye puri rakam sancheti bandhuo ko lautaa di gayi
 The Congress alleges that the BJP government in the state is misusing power
 congress adhyaksh nand kumaar patel ne is maamle main kaha, 'bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ji ke saath sancheti ji raipur aae the uske baad kaarywahi shuru hui or ye krit hua vaanijya kar mantri ko ham puri tarah se javabdeh maanate hai apane vibhaag main inako itnaa niyantran nahin he kii vasuul kiye gayi kar ko in ke adhikari 17-17 karod rupaye lautaa rahe hai to wo unke ishaare par he yaa wo nahin jaanate

 ahmedabad ke naroda main kaale jaadu ko vajah bataakar aatmahatya karne vaale kunal trivedi or unke parivaar kii maut ke maamle main ek nayaa khulaasa hua he
 In fact, the police recovered another suicide note written by Kunal's house by his wife Kavita
 jiske mutabik kunal kipremikakiatmaunhen pareshaan karti thi
 In that suicide note, Kavita has opened such a secret, which makes the whole case of suicide clear
 kavita ne us note main likhaa he "kunalki ek premika thi
 With whom he wanted to marry
 haalanki parivaar waalon ke inkaar kar dene par kunal ne usase shaadi nahin kii thi
 Due to this, the girl committed suicide
 usee premika kii aatma unhen pareshaan karti thi
 "not only this, Kavita has also written this in her suicide note" She had sold her bungalow for one crore rupees
 wo paise aane ke baad jo bhi paisa bachaa tha, wo maine or kunal ne aapas main baant liya he
 i am giving you my money
 aaj din tak maine jo bhi bachat kii he, wo sreen beti ke liye he
 But i am taking Srinine with me
 wo hissaa bhi main aapako dena chaahati hum
 "kavita has further written in her letter saying that she is troubling the soul" neither does she want to kill nor does she want to live
 jis vajah se kaaphi sochane ke baad ye kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Have you ever thought that a human being can suffer so much? har do chaar din main ek nai baat sunne ko milti he
 And she does not want to let us live in peace
 duniya is baat ko nahin samajhegi
 The opposite will be called crazy
 isliye ham sab saath ja rahe hai
 There is no coercion from Kunal, i have made this decision only after thinking a lot
 kyonki kunal ke bina jeena bahut mushkil he
 This world will not allow our mother and daughter to live
 "vahiin kunal trivedi ke ghar ke daravaaje ke upar jo tasviir lagi thi, wo bhi unki andhashraddha kii or ishaara karti he
 However, the police has recorded the statement of Kunal's mother
 jisamen unhone bataaya ki kavita ne kunal kii jis premika kaa zikr kiya tha, kunal baar-baar unhen kahata tha ki wo usase shaadi karnaa chahta tha
 But he committed suicide
 ab uski aatma use pareshaan kar rahi he
 DCP Ahmedabad says that the suicide plan for Kunal and Kavita was from a few days ago
 8 sitambar ko kavita kii bahan ke ghar driver ke haath teen bag bheje the
 Which had clothes, gold ornaments and cash rupees
 jisaki total value 10 lakh rupee he
 In the same bag was this letter written by Kavita
 driver ke haathon bheje gaye bag ko kuch dinon ke liye unke ghar main rakhane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 At the same time, Kunal's mother says that Kunal was very aggressive in nature
 vah hameshaa apni premika kaa naam lekar kavita ke saath jhagada karata tha
 On the 8th, Kavita had told her maid-servant to lock the house outside
 jiske baad kamwali taala laga kar chali gai thi
 However, they committed suicide on the 11th
 tab tak ve ghar ke andar hi the
 Police have also received sleeping pills from Kunal's house
 police ko shaq he ki us goli kaa istemaal beti ko behosh karne or phir use faansee par latakaane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 At the moment, superstition is believed to be the reason for this whole case

 naidu kehete hai ki takneekee rup se unnat desh bhi matapatron ke madhyam se matdaan ko zyada surakshit voting prakriya maanate hue is ore laut aae hai
 Their concern is that by controlling the micro-controllers installed in evms, evms can be manipulated so that the voter wants to vote, the vote goes to someone else instead

 rajasthan kikebddiki pehali international player shalini pathak jab kabddi khelti thim to unhen bhadde-bhadde coments sunne ko milte the
 Shalini, who arrived at India Today Women's Summit, narrated many stories of her journey
 summit ke duusare satr main rajasthan police main inspector or kabddi player shalini pathak ne bataaya ki jab unhone kabddi khilne kaa faisla kiya to shuruyaat main parents ne saport nahin kiya
 He told, 'I am the first Kabaddi International player of Rajasthan
 jakarta main hue asian games main hamane silver medal hasil kiya
 My whole identity is INDIA, whatever struggle and hard work we do, that's why we play for India
 main jakarta main hue asian games main indian team kaa hissaa rahi hum jisane silver medal jeeta
 'he told,' i had chosen a game which is considered to be a men's game
 koi bhi parents nahin chahenge ki unki ladki kabddi jaisaa game khele
 When his daughter came home, she was soaked in mud, or bleeding from somewhere
 yah ek aisa khel he jisamen paseene ke saath khun bahata he
 My father himself has been a national player of kabaddi
 lekin mere parents ne shuru main koshish kii ki main koi or sef game jaise tennis vagairah khel luun
 But then my parents thought that i want to play Kabaddi, then they supported and i reached here
 'kya aapako kabhi aisa mahasoos karaayaa gaya ki ki aap ladki hai or kabddi nahin khel saktin? is sawaal ke jawaab main shalini ne kaha, 'mujhe ye sab phase nahin karnaa padaa
 My father was very supportive
 sports main kaaphi workout karnaa padataa he
 When i used to run, my father used to walk by bike
 vah chaahate the ki main sports main kuch karun
 While playing in the field, i had to talk to the boys and play in shorts
 shalini ne kaha, 'jab aap gaanv main khel rahe hai to aapako kaan band kar lene padate hai
 People used to say such things in the village that i cannot tell
 khilne ke dauraan koi bolta tha ki are chikani ko pakad lo, isko jane mat do lekin aapako dhyaan rakhana hota he ki in sab chizon se aapako focus naa hat jaae
 Shalini told her father's support that his father was like Bapu in the Dangal film
 unhen apane pita se bahut saport mila
 Talking about his role model, Shalini said, "my father has been the greatest inspiration
" meri ek role model athlete krishna punia bhi hai
 He said that there is a lot to be learned from everyone's story
 isse pehle court ne donon kii jamaanat arji par aaj (18 taarikh) tak apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 He had said in his bail plea that no concrete evidence has been found by the investigating agencies so far
 saath hi kanhaiya ko jamaanat mil chuki he, lihaaja unhen zamaanat di jaae
 At the same time, according to a report, the high level inquiry panel of JNU found Omar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya 'guilty' of seditiousness, caste or regional sentiments or spreading bitterness among students in the sedition case
 up mahanireekshak (karagaar) tihaad jail ke jariye anirbaan or umr ko bheje gaye kaaran bataao notice main vishvavidhyalay ne unhen chaar aaropon ke tahat ' doshi' mana
 a five-member committee has issued show cause notices to 21 students, including Anirban and Omar, for being found 'guilty' of violating university rules and disciplinary rules
 vahiin, ek khabar ke mutabik jeenyu ke ucch stareey jaanch panel ne deshadroh maamle main umr khalid or anirbaan bhattacharya ko vaimnasyta, jatigat yaa kshetreey bhavanaaen bhadakaane yaa chaatro ke bich katutaa failaane kaa ‘doshi’ paaya he
 In a show cause notice sent to Anirban and Umar through the Deputy Inspector General (prisons) Tihar Jail, the university considered them 'guilty' under four charges
 paanch sadasyeey cameti ne vishvavidhyalay ke niyamon or anushaasanamak niyamon ke ulanghan kaa ' doshi ' paae jane par anirbaan or umr samet 21 chaatro ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he
 The old saying is that all is fair in love and war
 aise main baat jab chunavi dangal kii ho to saare niyam dhare ke dhare rah jate hai
 You must have heard a lot about the rallies of the leaders in the election, but in this blind race of victory, there is also a story that has not been heard nor seen till now
 chunavi maahaul main jahaan sab kuch netaa, vot or vaade par tikaa he, vahiin dakshini dilli ke paush ilaake main privet jasoos sanjeev desawaal in dinon kaaphi biji hai
 Not only Sanjeev but many famous detectives like him are busy these days
 maahaul chunaav kaa he or aap soch rahe honge ki aakhir iskaa jasusi se kya conection he to aapako bataa den ki yah ek aisa raaj he jo andhere main rasta banaata he or siyaasi kasarat main shikhar tak le jaataa he
 We are not covering the curtain with this secret, but Sanjeev Deswal, a well known detective of Delhi
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 In such a situation, every leader who is trying his luck in the political field is trying to beat his opponents
 bhale hi har party or netaa janata ke bich jaakar apane-apane jeet ke daawey kar rahaa ho, lekin jamini sachai yah he ki netaji apane kaam or mehnat se zyada virodhiyon ke kaam par najar banaae hue hai or vah bhi privet jasuson ke jariye
 Preparations begin six months ago, Sanjeev Deswal and his private detectives are engaged in spying on the leaders for about 6 months before the election
 aapako jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki jasusi kii yah kahani pehle apni hi party se shuru hoti he
 The leaders first monitor the ticket distribution through the spies and then the spying of the opponents begins
 jasusi kaa yah kissa photo or basic jaankaree se shuru hota he
 You can also see spy photos of some politicians on the lap-top of Sanjeev Deswal, where the leader of a party who is in the electoral fray of Delhi and who has a wealth of illegal property
 lekin yah baat chunaav ayog se chhupaai gai he
 Story of illicit relations: In the field, it is the first choice of everyone to find out the information about the illicit relation of any woman of the opposing leader through these spies
 jaahir he aise main virodhiyon ko badnaam kar un par shikanja kasnaa aasaan hota he
 To this day, when the reporter was sitting in the office of detective Sanjeev Deswal, then a worker of a big leader standing in Delhi elections opens the door
 jasoos kaaryakarta ko ek sidi detaa he or kaaryakarta chalaa jaataa he
 When the reporter caught the worker of that big political party outside Sanjeev Deswal's office to know the full story of the espionage case and tried to know the secret of the black game of elections, it came to know that this private activist of a big party of the country Came to get a CD for his leader
 yah wo sidi he jisamen kai raaj chupe hai
 Such secrets that can create panic in the country's politics in the coming days
 kisi ko mahaan to kisi ko sadak par laane kaa madda rakhte hai
 This is just hallmark
 jasusi, sidi or sidi main chhipe jane kitne hi raaj abhi netaaon kii chunavi yojana main shaamil ho chuke hai yaa hone vaale hai

 aapane aksar mandiron main hanumanji kii khadi yaa baithi hui pratimaa dekhi hogi or ghar par bhi aapane aisi hi murti sthapit kii hogi
 But you might not know that there is a temple of Hanumanji where his idol standing on his head is worshiped
 indore main sthit he yah mandirulate hanuman ji kaa mandir indore ke saanware naamak sthaan par sthapit he
 The temple is believed to date back to the Ramayana period
 mandir main bhagwaan hanuman kii ulate mukh vaali sindur se saji murti virajman he
 Sanwer Kahanuman Temple is an important place for Hanuman devotees
 yahaan aakar bhakt bhagwaan ke atoot bhakthi main leen hokar sabhi chintaaon se mukt ho jate hai
 Unlike all the temples of Lord Hanuman, this temple attracts everyone's attention due to its specialty
 is rup ke peeche yah katha he lokapriyakaha jaataa he ki jab ramayana kaal main bhagwaan shri ram va ravan kaa yuddh ho rahaa tha tab ahiravana ne ek chaal chali
 He changed his form and included himself in Ram's army and while everyone was sleeping at night, Ahiravan by his magic power unconsciously kidnapped Shri Ram and Lakshman ji
 vah unhen apane saathpataal lok main le gayaor jab vanar sena ko is baat kaa pataa chalata he to chaaron ore hadakamp much gaya
 Hanuman ji reached Patal Lok in search of Lord Rama and Laxman ji and by killing Ahiravan there he brought back Lord Shree Ram and Laxman safely
 manyata he kii yahi vah sthaan tha jahaan se hanuman ji pataal lok kii or gaye the
 At that time Hanuman ji's feet were towards the sky and the head was towards the earth, due to which his reverse form is worshiped
 is mandir kii yah visheshta he prasiddhsanver ke ulatehanuman mandir main ek mukhya manyatayah he ki yadi koi vyakti teen mangalvaar yaa paanch mangalvaar tak is mandir ke darshanon ke liye lagaataar aata he to uske sabhi ksht dur ho jate hai or uski sabhi manokamanaayen bhi purna hoti he
 There is also the recognition of offering Hanumanji Chola on Tuesday
 ulate hanuman mandir ke darshan maatr se hi sabhi samasyaayein dur ho jaati he
 Statues of Shri Ram, Sita, Lakshmanji, shiva-parvati ji are also enshrined in the temple
 mandir main sthit hanuman ji kii pratimaa ko atyant chamatkaari mana jaataa he
 Along with this, there are two years old Parijat trees in the opposite Hanuman temple

 ’ Probably for the first time in the history of Mahapalikas in the country, almost all the parties against a Municipal Commissioner were unanimous
 unke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav paarit hua
 The case is of Municipal Commissioner Tukaram Munde of Navi Mumbai, against whom the congress-ncp-shiv Sena all but mobilized the BJP
 ab faisla mukhyamantri ko karnaa he
 However, a large number of local people have launched a campaign in support of Munde
 mangalvaar ko halaat aise bane kii avishvaas prastaav par matdaan ke dauraan navi mumbai nagar nigam (enememasi) mukhyalay ke aasapaas dhara 144 lagaani padi
 All the councilors except BJP, stood against him
 avishvaas prastaav chah ke mukaable 105 maton se paas ho gaya
 NMMC Mayor Sudhakar Sonawane said "they do not believe in democracy
" yahaan par sadan main jo nirnay hote hai use wo khaarij karte rahete hai
 No respect for the mayor
 
 Councilor has no respect
 aisa adhikari shahar ke liye thik nahin
 Munde has suffered eight transfers in ten years

 During his tenure at NMMC, Munde has suspended ten officials including Deputy Municipal Commissioner on corruption charges
 2012 ke baad gaanvthan main bane avaidh nirmaanon ko munde ke kaarykaal main tod gaya
 Every party has strongly opposed this to save its vote bank
 shahar main band bhi rakhaa
 In the first three months of Munde's tenure, 1,916 illegal hawkers, 1,801 illegal constructions and 1,010 hoardings were broken
 2,492 kaarobaari nirmaan par ossie na hone or emartipi act ke ulanghan kii vajah se jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya
 He also served notice on the illegal construction of the area's BJP mla's bungalow
 tippaniyan But the councilors allege that Munde only considers himself honest, the rest dishonest
 shivasena ke parshad sanju wade ne kaha ki "shivesna-ensipi-congress ne milakar avishvaas prastaav ko samarthan diya
 The work of Mundesahi, since he has come, the work he has been doing since then broke the huts, suspended the people
 aise karke shahar ko badnaam kiya"
 On this dispute, Munde says that he did what is within the scope of the law
 shashan ne unhen jo zimmedaari di he wo use nibhaayenge
 Many ministers and leaders of many BJP are also standing against Munde
 vaise is avishvaas prastaav par aakhri faisla mukhyamantri ko hi lenaa he
 On Tuesday, the situation became such that during the vote on the no confidence motion, Section 144 had to be imposed around the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) headquarters

 parshad kaa koi sammaan nahin
 Such an officer is not good for the city
 munde das saalon main aath tabadale jhel chuke hai
 As a Solapur collector, he took action against the sand and land mafia, but there too, he stood against all the stalwarts from Praniti Shinde to Munde
 enememasi main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke aaropon main munde dipti municipal kamishnar sahit das adhikariyon ko suspend kar chuke hai
 After 2012, illegal constructions in village Rathan were broken during Munde's tenure
 apane vot bank ko bachaane har party ne iskaa jamkar virodh kiya

 And ignoring all the advice, Vinod Rai puts the Indian captain's point above
 lekin kohli ke khaas prastaav par is baar vinod raay ne hi pallaa jhaad liya he

 The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) demanded that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan resign after the Supreme Court's decision to hand over the investigation into the Vyapam scam and related cases to the CBI
 supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue congress or 'aap' donon ne ummid jataayi ki sheersh adaalat jaanch kaary kii nigaraanee bhi karegi
 Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said the victims should get justice
 mukhyamantri ke liye jaruri he ki vah istipha den taaki jaanch sahi dhang se ho sake
 It would be appropriate that the Chief Minister resign, as he has control of the police till date
 yadi unhen clin chit milti he, to vah waapas mukhyamantri pad sambhaal sakate hai
 The comments aisi hi maang karte hue 'aap' ke pravaktaa ashish khetaan ne kaha ki rajya kii jaanch agenciyon dwaara is maamle main kii gai jaanch se supreme court ke asantosh vyakt kiye jane ke baad chouhan ko istipha de dena chahie
 Khaitan said that prima facie the Supreme Court found genuineness in all the allegations leveled against Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his government that the investigation by the state agencies was not satisfactory
 unhone kaha ki ab mukhyamantri ko apane pad par bane rahane kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin rah gaya he
 Welcoming the decision of the Supreme Court, both the Congress and the AAP expressed the hope that the apex court would also oversee the investigation
 congress pravaktaa tom vadakkan ne kaha ki peediton ko nyaay milanaa chahie
 It is necessary for the Chief Minister to resign so that the investigation can be conducted properly
 yahi uchit hoga ki mukhyamantri istipha den, kyonki aaj kii taarikh main police kaa niyantran unke hi paas he
 If he gets a clean chit, he can take back the chief minister's post
 tippaniyan Making similar demands, AAP spokesperson Ashish Khaitan said that Chauhan should resign after the Supreme Court expressed dissatisfaction with the investigation conducted by the state's investigating agencies in the matter
 khetaan ne kaha ki pratham drushtya ucchtam nyaayalay ne shivaraj singh chouhan or unki sarkaar ke khilaaf lagaae gaye sabhi aaropon main vaastaviktaa pai he ki rajya agenciyon kii jaanch santoshjanak nahin he

 'no letter, no message, no matter which country you went to
 
 Where did you go to hurt this heart? ' jagajeet singh kii gaai ghazal kii ye panktiyaan yun to sabhi kii jubaan par hai lekinvidhansabha chunaavake baad uttar pradesh ke log in panktiyon ko phir se gunagunaane lage hai kyonki chunaav ke dauraan taal thonk rahe bade raajnneetik suramaaon kaa na to koi sandesh hi mil rahaa he or na hi yah pataa chal paa rahaa he ki ve kiske saath apni haar kaa gam baant rahe hai
 The first thing to talk about is Uma Bharti, an outspoken leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan uma ne tabadatod 200 se zyada jansabhaayen kii thim
 Uma was also excited because she realized that the party had done wonders, now the chief minister's chair is no more far from her after being given the responsibility of party in Uttar Pradesh
 vidhansabha chunaav ko beete 20 din se adhik ho chuke hai
 The state BJP leaders are contemplating meeting the cause of defeat, but in which corner the claimant leaders of the Chief Minister are now forgetting the grief of defeat, even the party leaders themselves do not know
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, 'sukh ke sab saathi, dukh main na koy
 During the election, BJP national president Nitin Gadkari had described Uma as a contender for the chief minister, which she was excited about
 ab haar ke naam par kii ja rahi chintan baithkon main koun apana maathaa khapaana chahega
 After Uma, if you talk about Congress Crown Prince and National General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, then after the defeat, he is probably so broken that he is unable to muster the courage to come among his loved ones
 congress mahasachiv ne chunaav ke dauraan puure pradesh main jabardast chunavi abhiyaan chalaaya tha lekin unki party 28 siten hi jeet pai
 If Congress sources are to be believed, he is sitting in Delhi and churning out the reasons for the defeat and the weakness of the organization in Uttar Pradesh to save the party from major losses in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ke dauraan uma ne bhi rahul gandhi or unki bahan priyanka badra ko 'barsaati mechak' hi qaraar diya tha
 However, talk between these two national parties about two other important leaders of the assembly elections, who had made big claims but the result was cipher
 rashtriya kranti party (rashtravaadi) ke sangrakshak kalyaan singh or rashtriya lokmanch ke sangrakshak amar singh ke saamne to ab astitv kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 The same thing was being said for both the leaders then, 'maya Mili Na Ram (mulayam)
 'kalyaan is gam main duube hue hai ki unki party ko is chunaav main ek bhi seat nahin mili
 Moreover, he could not avoid the defeat of his daughter-in-law Premlata and son Rajveer
 sutron kii maane to 'babuji' is samay is baat par manthan kar rahe hai ki 300 se adhik siton par ladane vaali party ko aakhir ek bhi seat kyon nahin mili
 Now Amar Singh is upset with SP unki haalat bhi bhigi billi vaali ho gai he
 Azam has completely opened a front against Amar Singh, who dreams of defeating Azam Khan, so no one knows what this satrap is doing against Azam
 bataaya jaataa he ki is bich lalabatti vaali gaadi se rampur pahunche ajam ne amar or jaya pradaa ko kaaphi kharikhoti sunaate hue unki aukaat tak bataa daali
 Believed to be the messiah of Dalits, Mayawati's love for Dalits probably lasts until she gets a chair
 satta haath se khisakane ke baad pradesh ke daliton ko unke haal par chhodkar khud dilli chali jaati hai
 Mayawati's history has been that she never likes to sit in the Assembly as the Leader of the Opposition
 udhar, chote choudhary ke naam se mashhoor jayant choudhary ne bhi saansad rahete hue mathura jile kii maant vidhansabha seat se daavedaari pesh kii thi or jite bhi
 He also had a desire to become the Chief Minister but if the wish was not fulfilled, he considered it appropriate to resign from the Mont seat and stay in the Lok Sabha within a month
 raajnneetik vishleshak or varisht patrkaar abhayanand shukla kehete hai, 'amar singh or kalyaan singh ke raajnneetik astitv par sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 These two leaders will have to find their political ground anew
 asli netaa vahi hota he jo haar ke baad bhi aam janata ke bich jane kaa saahas jutata he
 ' chhattisgarh sarkaar ne nagarikon ko behatar upachaar suvidha pradaan karne ke liye rajya main doctor khoobchand baghel swasthya sahaayta yojana or mukhyamantri vishesh swasthya sahaayta yojana kii shuruyaat karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Senior officials of the state said that the Chhattisgarh government, in a meeting of the Council of Ministers chaired by Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, to provide better and quality treatment facilities to all the citizens of the state, two new health schemes, Dr
 Khubchand Baghel Health Assistance Scheme and Chief Minister Special Health Assistance

 Officials said that in the cabinet meeting, it was decided to start the Chief Minister's Special Health Assistance Scheme for rare diseases by expanding the Sanjivani aid fund
 isamen prakaran ke anusaar or mukhyamantri ke anumodan ke baad adhiktam 20 lakh rupe tak ke ilaaj kii suvidha pradaan kii jaaegi
 Chhattisgarh is the first state which is providing such a large amount for the treatment of its citizens

 The comments mulaayam ne kaha, ‘mayawati rajya kii ab tak kii sabase badi bhoomi mafia he
 He forcefully acquired thousands of acres of land for the construction of parks and monuments
 ’ unhone kaha ki virodh karne vaale kisaanon par police ne laathiyaan barasaai
 When SP was in government, no one could even imagine such a time
 unhone kaha ki kareeb 40 hajaar karod rupaye kaa saarvajanik dhan parkon main hathi kii pratimaayein banane par kharch kiya gaya
 All this was done in the name of BR Ambedkar who is an insult to the biggest leader of the Dalits
 mulaayam ne kaha, ‘agar aaj ambedkar jivit hote to mayawati ko jail main daal diya hota
 We will build schools and colleges in Ambedkar's name in parks and monuments built by Mayawati in Lucknow and Noida
 ’ Mulayam said, 'mayawati is by far the biggest land mafia in the state
 unhone parkon or smarakon ke nirmaan ke liye balpurvak hajaaron acre jameen adhigrahit kii
 He said that the police used lathi on the protesting farmers
 jab sapa sarkaar main thi, us samay koi aisi kalpana tak nahin kar saktaa tha
 He said that about Rs
 40 thousand crores was spent on making elephant statues in public parks
 yah sab biaar ambedkar ke naam par kiya gaya jo daliton ke sabase bade netaa kaa apmaan he
 Mulayam said, 'if Ambedkar had been alive today, Mayawati would have been put in jail

 rajyasabha main buudhvaar ko kalakatta hoicourt ke jaj saumitr sen ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi ke saath itihaas rachaa gaya jisamen sen ne kaha ki unhen bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he or dhan kii herapheri ke aarope purv pradhan nyaayadhish keji baalkrishnan kii ore se purv nirdhaarit tareeke se lagaae gaye hai
 On Wednesday, for the first time in the Rajya Sabha, the House was converted into a court for impeachment proceedings against a judge
 ucch sadan main kareeb do ghante tak apane bachaav main 53 varshiya sen ne nyaay kii guhaar kii
 Marxist leader Sitaram Yechury and Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley moved resolutions in this regard after which proceedings were initiated
 supreme court ke nyaayadhish bi sudarshan reddy kii adhyakshata vaali jaanch cameti ne sen ko kadachaar kaa doshi tehraaya tha
 The committee held him guilty of misappropriation of money as a court-appointed receiver in a case
 maamla 1983 main ek vivaad main cell se jude dhan kaa he
 The motion called for the removal of Justice Sen
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet lagbhag sabhi 245 sadsy sadan main maujuud the or sabhapati hamid ansaari ne nyaayamurti sen ko vishesh rup se banaae gaye baar main bulaayaa
 As the proceedings were about to begin, Ansari said to the marshals, does Justice Sen exist? They should be brought to the bar of the House
 prastaav ke baad sadan kii ore se nyaayamurti sen ko apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Presenting his stand for nearly two hours, he described himself as completely innocent
 unhone kaha, maine kanoon ke anuroop sabhi upayon kaa rasta apanaaya
 i have come here to get justice
 yadi aap mere khilaaf mahabhiyog ko manjuur karte hai, to yah abhi tak kaa sabase bada anyaay hoga
 Make any decision completely, because it is a question related to my life, my existence
 unhone purv pradhan nyaayadhish baalkrishnan ko maamle main jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki vah maamle main aaropee, abhiyojak or nyaayadhish ban gaye
 Sen said that even if the impeachment motion was passed against him, he would still say that he has not manipulated the money
 mujhe nyaaypalika kii swatchta ke naam par bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 Yechury said that he is proposing with a sense of anguish, while Jaitley said that Sen is misleading the House
 jetali ne kaha ki sen ne nyaayadhishon ke jaanch ayog ko digbhramit kiya he or aaj bhi rajyasabha main apane bachaav main aisa kar rahe hai
 While presenting these proposals, Yechury said that the purpose of presenting them is not to make any comments against the judiciary
 yah prastaav ek vyakti ke khilaaf he, jisane dhan kii herapheri kii he
 We want the report of the Committee of Inquiry against Justice Sen to be accepted, so that no one has a chance to point fingers at the integrity of the judiciary
 gauratlab he ki rajyasabha ke sabhapati dwaara nyaayamurti sen ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon kii jaanch ke liye jo jaanch samiti niyukt kii gai thi, usamen nyaayamurti sudarshan reddy, nyaayamurti mukul mudgal or prakhyat vidhivetta phali es nariman shaamil the
 The said committee in its report recommended the removal of Justice Sen
 yah doosraa avasar he jab sansad main kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi shuru hui he
 Earlier in 1993, a case of impeachment was filed against Justice Ramaswamy in the Lok Sabha, but the resolution could not be passed due to the Congress not participating in the division of votes
 nyaayamurti sen ne yahaan tak kaha ki ek nyaayadhish kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaana nyaaypalika kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchane ke samaan he
 Earlier, while presenting the motion in the House, Yechury said that it is a coincidence that when the whole country is raging on the issue of corruption, impeachment proceedings are being started against a judge in the Rajya Sabha, who the committee found involved in money laundering is
 unhone kaha ki nyaayamurti sen ke khilaaf aarope asandigdh rup se sahi paae gaye hai
 Marxist leader Yechury said that the then Chief Justice of India had written a letter to the Prime Minister against Justice Sen
 unhone kaha ki rajyasabha ke 58 sadasyon dwaara prastaav ko anumodith kiye jane ke baad hi kisi nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi shuru ho sakati he
 Yechury said that we should assure the people of the country that we (parliament) are against corruption
 jetali ne kaha ki mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi ek durlabhtam maamla he, jisamen vyakti ko hataakar nyaayadhish ke pad ke sammaan kii raksha kii jaati he
 He said that the money laundering case against Justice Sen has been undoubtedly proved and he did not put forward many facts in the House
 jetali ne kaha ki abhi tak nyaayamurti sen ke khilaaf jo bhi jaanch hui he, usamen unka yah rukh rahaa he ki pehle unke khilaaf aarope sabit kiye jaae, uske baad hi vah apana paksh rakhenge
 Earlier, Justice Sen stated his stand, saying that the decision to convict him had been taken long back because he was investigated against him despite the High Court acquitting him of the charges
 quarter final main pakistan bhale hi australia se haar gaya, lekin haarate-haarate kangaroo team ko haraane kii tarkeeb bhi bataa gaya
 Now the need is that when Team India landed the semi-final against Australia on 26 March, then they got down to these tricks and got the courage, which is necessary to defeat the big teams
 20 march ko ovel ke maidan main hue is match main bharat ke paas kai sabak hai
 The biggest lesson is the killer spell of Wahab Riyaz
 wahaab ne aatishi ballebaaj shen watson ko apni bounsar gendon se is kadar pareshaan kiya ki vah spel itihaas main darj ho gaya
 Wahab was also aggressive with his balls with body language
 yah gussa yun hi nahin tha
 While he was batting, Stark sledged at him in typical Australian style
 iskaa badla baad main unhone apni gendon se liya
 His fizzle bouncers went one by one near Shane Watson's ear
 unke dimag main apane captain misbah kaa vahi vaakya tha, 'jaao or hamalaa karo
 'the Indian team will have to do the same
 bounsar maaro, hamalaa bolo, jarurat pade to sledging bhi karo
 There is a common belief in cricket that Asian batsmen are not able to play relatively good balls bouncing
 ek arase se carabian or australian gendbaaj apane pes or bouns se asian ballebaajon par hamalaa karte rahe hai
 But Wahab has proved that kangaroos can be pushed on the backfoot by attacking them in the same way
 bhartiya pes bydaree in dinon shandaar form main he
 6-foot Umesh Yadav can take responsibility for the work that Wahab has done
 beete maichon main vah 145 kimi / ghanta kii speed se gendbaaji kar chuke hai
 Mohammad Shami is also consistently throwing the ball at a speed of 140
 is world cap main unhone short of good length gendon kaa badhiya istemaal kiya he
 Even Mohit Sharma, a relatively slow bowler, has troubled the batsmen with small balls
 gendbaaji ke saath ballebaaji ke morche par bhi yahi karnaa hoga
 Keep the body language aggressive and control your nerves from within
 'pressure cooker sichuation' main del sten jaisaa gendbaaj bhi ek over main 12 ran dephend nahin kar paata
 Therefore the removal of fear is necessary
 yani kul milakar vaisaa khel dikhaane kii jarurat he jaisaa film 'chak de india' main shahrukh kii team argentina ke khilaaf mukaable main dikhaati he
 The March 26 game will be a game of temperament, not talent
 yaad kiijie 'chak de' kaa vah seen, jab kabir khan apni nasen numaayan karte hue team se kahata he, 'wo ek maaren to tum chaar maaro

 jab ham aadhunik hindu dharm kii baat karte hai to hamaara kya taatpary hota he? hamen is baat ko lekar spasht hone kii jarurat he ki sabarimala kaa sambandh aise bhagwaan se judi dharmik pratha se he jinhen brahmacharya siddhant se mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 For this reason, a tradition has been going on for a long time that before coming to the temple for worship, devotees had to adopt "sexual purity" for a certain time
 unhen kai sankalp lene hote the or isi aadhaar par unhone mahilaon ke pravesh par pratibandh laga rakhe the
 We should keep in mind that religion inspired by celibacy tends to be more feminine
 aapkaa brahmacharya ke prati aagrah he, to jaahir he ki mahilaon ke prati gaharaa andeh hoga
 In Sabarimala, along with the dimension of celibacy, there was talk of discrimination against women as impure
 yahaan 10 se lekar 50 saal tak kii mahilaon ke liye pravesh bas is kaaran varjit tha kyonki unhen masik dharm hota he
 There is no philosophical or basic spiritual principle behind it
 hindu dharm ne pavitra or apavitra ke bich kii jaisi rekha khinch rakhi he, vaisaa kisi bhi anya dharm main nahin he
 There is clearly a biased conduct towards women on one side and Dalits on the other side
 bhagwaan kii pariklpana se iskaa kya sarokaar he? koi sarokaar nahin he
 It is part of the social and cultural traditions that play an important role in the ways of defining "hinduism"
 baharhaal, pitrusatta to pehle se hi maujuud he or isi vichaar se grast he ki purush kaa stri par adhikaar hota he or purush hi vichaaron kii duniya ko niyantrit karata he
 Everyone narrates the story of the Vedic philosopher Gargi and says, "oh, great
 yahi ek mahila thi jo yajyavlky ke saath shastrarth kar sakati thi
 "but if we look closely, we will find that Gargi was alone with six people
 yajyavlky ke saath shastrarth karne waalon main paanch purush hai, gargi akeli stri he
 Only the courage to ask Yajnavalkya is able to do that
 or aakhirkaar hua kya? yajyavlky ne apane uttar se santusht karke shastrarth samaapt nahin kiya, balki bol pade, "he stri! itane zyada prashn na karo ki tumhaara mastishk tukade-tukade na ho jaae
 Was it compatible with the tradition of debate? Of course, Gargi was a scholar, but it should also be noted how she was finally silenced
 phir use kahana hi padaa, "haa, nihsandeh aap sabase mahaan hai
 "therefore, women ultimately have to say that they fully agree with the prevailing traditions

 BJP president Amit Shah has already started working on his strategy for the 2019 general election
 enarasi par jis tarah se amit shah ne apni party kaa rukh saaf kiya or vipaksh se kaha ki wo enarasi par apana rukh spasht karen
 Since then, it is clear that the BJP will go to the 2019 elections on the NRC issue
 2016 assam vidhansabha chunaav se bijepi ne enarasi ko ek bada chunavi mudda banaaya tha
 This was also seen in the bjp's election results
 amit shah pehle hi north east ke daure main kah chuke hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main north east kii 25 loksabhaa siton main se 21 jeetenge
 Amit Shah is well aware that BJP campaigned in Assam elections on NRC issue
 asmi muslim Vs bangladeshi muslim ke is campagne ne bijepi kii jeet main bada role play kiya tha
 In the Lok Sabha elections also, the issue of NRC will not only be North East but will become a major electoral issue in the whole country
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki dilli, ensiaar, bihar, mumbai, jharkhand samet desh ke sabhi metro shaharon main bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon kaa ek bada mudda he
 BJP strategists have produced reports that Bangladeshi and Rohingya intruders have reduced the employment of poor people in India
 is kaaran garib tabake main bangladeshi or rohingya ghuspaithiyon ke prati badi naaraazgi he
 In such a situation, BJP strategists believe that if it makes a big issue in the upcoming assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then the BJP will get the benefit in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections like Assam assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main enarasi mudde kaa north east ke saath-saath pashchim bengal main bhi bijepi ko bada phayda milegaa
 Because many districts of West Bengal are bordering Bangladesh
 2014 main bijepi ko pashchim bengal main bijepi ko do hi site mili thim, lekin vidhansabha or local body ke chunaav main jis tarah se bijepi kaa vot pratishat badha he uske baad bengal main bijepi tiemasi ke baad duusare sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 Like Assam under the leadership of former TMC leader Mukul Roy, BJP in West Bengal can make a leap from 2 seats to 10 seats directly if Bengali Muslim Vs make Bangladeshi Muslim issue in 2019 elections
 amit shah jis tarah kii ranneeti ke anusaar 2019 ke chunaav main upi, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai north east or pashchim bengal main apana janaadhar badha kar zyaada se zyaada loksabhaa siten jitkar karenge
 Anyway, Amit Shah and his team have already focused on the 120 seats where BJP finished second in the 2014 elections
 unamem north east or pashchim bengal kii bhi kai siten hai
 In a way, Amit Shah has already started working on his strategies according to the solidarity of the opposition
 ek taraf tripal talaak par modi sarkaar ne apane kadam aage badaye hai
 This has triggered a big discussion on the issue of triple divorce within Muslim society
 kyonki maamla muslim samaaj ke haath se dhire dhire nikalataa ja rahaa he
 The BJP has been able to withdraw support to Mehbooba Mufti's government in Jammu and Kashmir to send a message to its core voters that it will not compromise its ideology in any way
 yadi aise main supreme court is saal ke ant tak ram mandir hinduon ke paksh or jammu kashmir main artical 35 a ko samaapt karne kaa faisla detii he to phir 2019 ke chunaav main piem modi or amit shah enarasi, tripal talaak, ramamandir, artical 35A jaise muddon ke saamne vipaksh kii ekta hawa ho jaaegi
 Hearing the case of prohibition of liquor in the 500 meter area of the highway, the Supreme Court said that if a highway passes through the city, if it is denotified then there is nothing wrong in it
 is sambandh main court ne kaha ki city ke andar ke haive or bina city ke haive main bahut antar he
 Highway means where cars move at high speed
 supreme court ne kaha ki haive ke 500 meter daayre main sharaab kii bikri par roak ke peeche soch ye he ki log sharaab pikar tej raftaar main gaadi naa chalaae lekin lekin city main is tarah kii raftaar dekhne ko nahin milti
 The CJI asked the petitioner to answer the questions and then on July 11 would hear and issue the order
 darasal chandigarh main haive ko dinotiphoi karne ke maamle main supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In this case, the petitioner says that this step has been taken to neutralize the Supreme Court's decision to ban liquor shops up to 500 meters from National Highways and State Highways
 so supreme court ab ye tay karegaa ki kya is tarah haive ko dinotiphoi kiya ja saktaa he
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that denotification of the highway is being done only so that liquor shops are not closed and the states can get money
 badi sadakon ko jila sadak kaa naam diya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, after the Supreme Court's decision to ban liquor on the highway, action is being taken to denotify the highway in many states
 darasal chandigarh main kai jagah haive kaa naam badalakar 'major distric road' kaa naam kar diya gaya he
 With this, the Arrive Safe India NGO has filed a petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne haive par sharaab kii dukaanon ko band karne kaa faisla janhit main liya tha kyonki isse sadak durghatnaayen hoti hai
 In such a situation, the notification of March 16, 2017, to nullify the order of the Supreme Court of Chandigarh Administration is illegal and should be canceled
 haalanki punjab evam haryana hoicourt is yachika ko khaarij kar chukaa he
 The comments rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaanon par roak ke maamle main 31 march ko supreme court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki haive par sharaab kii dukaanon par roak jari rahegi
 However, there will be no shops up to 220 meters in areas with less than 20 thousand population in any town along the highway
 haive kinare baar or restaraan main bhi sharaab nahin bikegi
 In states where liquor licenses were granted before 15 December, the licenses will run till 30 September
 darasal pichley saal 15 disambar ko supreme court ne bada faisla diya tha ki rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaane nahin hongi
 However, it was also clarified that such shops can run till those who have licenses or till 31 March 2017, whichever is earlier
 CJI ne yachikakarta ko kaha ki wo sawaalon ke jawaab den or phir 11 july ko sunwaayee kar aadesh jari karenge
 Actually, the Supreme Court is hearing in the case of denotifying the highway in Chandigarh
 is maamle main yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaanon par roak ke supreme court ke faisle ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye ye kadam uthaaya gaya he
 So the Supreme Court will now decide whether the highway can be denotified in this way
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha tha ki haive ko dinotiphoi sirf isliye kiya ja rahaa he taaki sharaab kii dukaane band naa hon or rajyon ko paisa mil sake
 Major roads are being named as district roads
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ke haive par sharabbandi ke faisle ke baad kai rajyon main haive ko dinotiphoi karne kii karrwai kii ja rahi he
 In fact, the name of the highway has been changed to 'major District Road' in many places in Chandigarh
 isi ko lekar arive sef india NGO ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court had taken a decision in public interest to close liquor shops on the highway as it leads to road accidents
 aise main chandigarh prashasan supreme court ke aadesh ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye 16 march 2017 kaa notification avaidh he or radd kiya janaa chahie
 However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed this petition
 tippaniyan In the case of ban on liquor shops up to 500 meters from National Highways and State Highways, on 31 March, the Supreme Court ruled that liquor shops on the highway would continue to be banned
 haalanki haive ke kinare kisi kasbe main 20 hajaar se kam jansankhya vaale ilaakon main 220 meter tak dukaane nahin hongi
 Liquor will not be sold in bars and restaurants along the highway
 jin rajyon main sharaab ke license 15 disambar se pehle die gaye, vahaan license 30 sitambar tak chal jaaenge
 In fact, on December 15 last year, the Supreme Court gave a big decision that there will be no liquor shops 500 meters from the National Highways and State Highways
 haalanki usamen yah bhi saaf kiya gaya ki jinke paas license hai wo khatm hone tak yaa 31 march 2017 tak jo pehle ho, tak is tarah kii dukaane chal sakati hai
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that denotification of the highway is being done only so that liquor shops are not closed and the states can get money
 badi sadakon ko jila sadak kaa naam diya ja rahaa he

 PM Narendra Modi once again put his thoughts before the people through the 'mann Ki Baat' program on the radio
 modi ne kaha ki loktantr main janashakti kaa apaar mahatv he
 The Prime Minister said that he had full faith in the power of the people
 unhone kaha, 'is kaarykram se jariye maine logon se bahut-kuch hasil kiya he
 'he said that after appealing in the' Mann Ki Baat 'program, 30 lakh people of the country have given up gas subsidy
 unhone ise 'silent revolution' qaraar diya
 PM Modi said that sales of Khadi-made clothes have doubled compared to last year
 yah khaadi ko badhaava dene kii apil kaa nateeja he
 He said that on this Diwali people should give Khadi a place in their house
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'mere liye deshavaasiyon ke phone kol behad myne rakhte hai
 i am excited by the number of calls
 90 fisadi baaten nai urja paidaa karne vaali or sakaaratmak hoti hai
 Complaints are rarely available
 'kaarykram ke dauraan piem modi ne pawan naam ke ek shaks kii recorded aawaaj sunai, jisamen unhone piem se apil kii thi ki ve logon se diwali par mitti ke diye jalaane ko kahen
 a child's voice was also heard in the program, in which he appealed to the Prime Minister to keep dustbin in the streets and streets for cleanliness, so that the cleanliness drive could proceed properly

 co / kdx6ceetdh— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)september 20, 2015gauratlab he ki isse pehle bihar chunaav ke maddenjar JDU-RJD va congress ke mahagathbandhan ne chunaav ayog se is kaarykram par roak lagane kii maang kii thi, lekinayog ne is maang ko khaarij kar diyatha
 The Commission had given so much instruction that till the completion of elections, issues related to Bihar could not be raised in 'mann Ki Baat'
 hamaari raajnneeti main iz ikval tu ho gaya he
 Is equal to is the stage where every debate in politics becomes equal
 aisa tabhi hota he jab kisi mulk yaa rajya main do dalon ko baari-baari se raaj karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 This makes the charges against both of them equal to two
 agar congress bijepi par vyaapman ghotaale kaa aarope lagaae to bijepi congress par america company se rishwat lene kaa aarope laga sakati he
 With this, both become equal in immorality and become moral again
 iz ikval tu sirf congress banaam bijepi hi nahin balki kisi bhi dal kaa kisi se bhi ho saktaa he
 The person searching for Is Equal Two is incidentally in front of you, but if you want, you can patent this discovery in your name
 isi iz ikval tu kii avasthaa se bachane ke liye beesvin sadi main lokapal kii kalpana kii gai thi magar ikkisvin sadi main kanoon banane vaale lokapal kaa bhi iz ikval tu ho gaya he
 Now you will ask what the BJP is doing to the Lokpal, then the BJP will say what the Congress was doing
 phir congress kahegi ki hamane to kanoon bana diya tha
 Then the BJP will say that it is not the leader of the opposition and for this it is necessary to change the law and for that it is necessary to run the Parliament
 congress kahegi jaise aap hamaare samay khub sansad chalane dete the
 This way, the game of Is equal to two will continue
 pradhanmantri 26 july ko man kii baat pesh karne vaale hai lekin unki man kii baat kaa asar ye to hua hi he ki bijepi main bhi kai netaa man hi man man kii baat kar rahe hai
 The senior leader and BJP MP said that on July 10, he had spoken to the national president, but the friend managing the Facebook page mistakenly gave the letter to the man with the mind
 shanta kumaar ji apni chitthee ke har shabd ke saath khadey hai magar party main unke saath koi nahin khadaa he
 Shanta Kumar ji, Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy, hurt by the corruption charges leveled against BJP, has made it equal and said that Shanta Kumar has been misled by false propaganda of Congress
 ganimat he ki rudi sahab ne saansad shanta kumaar ko bijepi ke bheetar chipa hua congressi nahin kaha varna iz ikval tu kaa e ples bi kaa hole squaire ho jaataa jiske tahat bijepi ke andar bhi congressi ho sakate hai or congress ke bheetar bhi bhaajapai
 In another prime time show, Vyapam scam whistle blower and RSS veteran Anand Rai was described by one speaker as an agent of Digvijay Singh
 acha he ki is daur main shanta kumaar jaise log hai sochane vaale, kaayade se is chitthee kaa unke kaaryon ke sandarbh main bhi moolyankan ho saktaa tha, phir bhi aisi baat congress ke bheetar se bhi koi kahata to yakeen maaniye uskaa swaagat nahin hota
 Shanta Kumar has written to his national president Amit Shah that fingers have started getting up from Rajasthan to Maharashtra
 - madhya pradesh ke vyaapman ghotaale ne ham sab kaa sir shame se nicha kar diya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party worker is bowing his head
 - meraa suzav he ki ek nai aachaar samiti kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 In this committee, there were experienced and dedicated workers of the party who have never compromised to protect the values
 centre or rajya str par yah samitiyaan ek lokapal kaa kaam karen
 Courage the leaders sitting in power to point out their mistakes at the right time
 maine kaha na ki lokapal kaa iz ikval tu ho gaya he
 How the one who did not come in the country will come to the party
 is bich sansad kaa monsoon satr bilukla usee tarah shuru hua he jisaki charchaa jeth or asadha ke dinon se kii ja rahi thi
 In the morning, under the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu is Equal to Theory, he started giving the message that if the Congress said this, we will say that
 jaise koi kerala main baar license ghotaale ke bare main zikr karnaa chahta he
 Some people want to discuss Kerala's solar scam in which the current Chief Minister has received a hint from the judicial commission
 goa or assam kii purvavarti sarkaron ko america company ke dwaara rishwat dene kaa maamla bhi kaaphi bada he
 Then we have to discuss disaster relief money and rehabilitation scam in Uttaranchal
 karnataka kaa zamin ghotaalaa bhi he
 As it is automatically clear that all these scams are related to the Congress governments
 kya bijepi yah kah rahi he ki congress hamaare ghotaale na bataaye varna ham unke bataa denge
 Are both accepting their respective scams
 ve vil ask dem
 Congress also has a long list
 lalit get maamle main rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje, kendriya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, vyaapman maamle main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, kathith rup se 36000 karod ke chaaval ghotaale ke maamle main chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh
 After all, what would you or the audience do with this type of equal? kya donon ko doshi maanakar sazaa maaf kar denge
 This is a new type of punishment
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi or videsh mantri sushma swaraj ne spikar kii kursi ke nazadik sonia gandhi or mulaayam singh yadav se baatcheet bhi kii
 The Prime Minister earlier said that it is hoped that the session will go well and the opposition will get support
 lekin rajyasabha main congress ne apni line saaf kar di
 She will not back down until she resigns
 anand sharma ke bayaan ke baad rajya sabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne bhi aakraamak tareeke se kaha ki sushma swaraj apana paksh rakhane ke liye taiyaar hai or ham bhi is mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai lekin congress istife kii maang par adi rahi
 Congress leader Anand Sharma also made BJP equal to two, like Vekanya Naidu
 anand sharma ne kaha ki duniya bhar main bolne vaale pradhanmantri vyaapman-vasundhara par kyon nahin bolte hai
 Even without taking names, Anand Sharma was doing the same as two equal between Prime Minister Modi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 bijepi congress par aarope laga rahi he ki ham charchaa chaahate hai or congress sadan chalane nahin dena chaahati
 Anand Sharma said that i remember Arun Jaitley and Sushma ji
 ek nahin balki kai sansad ke satr barbaad kiye gaye
 You can read the printed booklet of both the records of Parliament
 ek shabd nahin koi bol sakaa
 There was not a question
 ek bill paarit nahin hua
 And the same thing happened after resignation
 sushamaa ji kaa apana bayaan he ki agar pehle istife ho jate to sadan chalata
 Look at the 2013, 2010 statement
 tippaniyan i had come to the thought that i would make you viewers tired of the principle of Is equal to only when Anand reached that part of Sharma's statement which still felt that in many cases it is not equal to
 anand sharma ne kaha ki venkaiya naidu ko bataanaa padegaa ki pehle 10 saal main jo nahin hua wo ek saal main kaise ho gaya
 The difference is that 10 years this irresponsible opposition was in the country
 bhaajapa
 And the credit for the work done in a year goes to the Congress
 to ab kya ye kaha jaae ki donon partiyaan ek duusare ko blackmel kar rahi hai
 Parliament is stuck in Is Equal Two
 raajnneeti kii naitikta chunaav na hone ke kaaran maayke chali gai he
 There is uproar in the in-laws but what should the people of the village do
 tamaasha dekhen yaa hisaab jode ki kiskaa kisase iz ikval tu hota he
 If the Congress accuses the BJP of the business scam, then the BJP can accuse the Congress of taking bribe from the American company
 isse aniatikta main donon baraabar hokar nae sire se naitik ho jate hai
 Is equal to not only Congress vs BJP, but any party can be from anyone
 iz ikval tu kii khoj karne vaala sanyogvash aapke saamne haazir he lekin aap chahen to meri is khoj ko apane naam se patent kara sakate hai
 The Lokpal was conceived in the twentieth century to avoid this Is Equal Two stage, but the Lokpal which became a law in the twenty-first century has also become Equal Two
 ab aap puuchhenge ki bijepi lokapal kaa kya kar rahi he to bijepi kahegi ki congress kya kar rahi thi
 Then the Congress will say that we have made a law
 phir bijepi kahegi ki vipaksh kaa netaa nahin he or iske liye kanoon badalanaa zaruri he or uske liye sansad kaa chalanaa zaruri he
 The Congress would say like you used to allow a lot of Parliament to run in our time
 is tarah se donon ke bich iz ikval tu kaa khel chalata rahegaa
 The Prime Minister is going to present Mann Ki Baat on 26 July, but the effect of his Mann Ki Baat has already happened that many leaders in BJP are also talking Mana Mana Mana
 varisht netaa or bhaajapa saansad ne bataaya ki 10 july ko unhone rashtriya adhyaksh ji se man kii baat kahi thi lekin fasebuk pej manage karne vaale mitra ne galati se chitthee ko man kii baat se jan kii baat kar di
 Shanta Kumar ji is standing with every word of his letter but no one is standing with him in the party
 bijepi par lagate bhrashtachar ke aaropon se aahat shanta kumaar ji kaa kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne iz ikval tu kar diya he or kaha he ki shanta kumaar congress ke mithyaa prachaaron ke bahekaave main aa gaye hai
 It is worth noting that Rudy Saheb did not call MP Shanta Kumar a Congressman hidden within the BJP or else a equal B's hole would become a square under which Congress can have Congress within BJP and BJP within Congress
 prime time ke ek anya sho main vyaapman ghotaale ke wheasal blor or aresas ke swanyasevak anand raay ko ek vaktaa ne digvijay singh kaa agent kah diya tha
 It is good that people like Shanta Kumar are thinking in this period, this letter could be evaluated in terms of their works, even if someone says such a thing from within the Congress, it is not welcome if you believe it
 shanta kumaar ne apane rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko likhaa he ki rajasthan se lekar maharashtra tak ungliyaan uthne lagi hai
 - The Vyapam Scam of Madhya Pradesh has shamed all of us with shame
 bhartiya janata party kaa kaaryakarta sir jhukaa kar chal rahaa he
 - i suggest that a new Ethics Committee should be formed
 is samiti main party ke aise anbhavi or samarpit kaaryakarta rahe jinhone mulyon kii raksha ke liye kabhi kisi prakaar kaa samjhauta na kiya ho
 These committees at the central and state level should act as an ombudsman
 satta main baithe hue netaaon ko thik samay par unki galati bataane kaa saahas karen
 i said that Lokpal's is equal to two
 jo desh main nahin aayaa wo party main kaise aa jayega
 Meanwhile, the monsoon session of Parliament has started in a similar manner which was being discussed since the days of Jeth and Ashada
 subah subah sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu iz ikval tu theory ke tahat sandesh dene lage ki agar congress ne ye kaha to ham wo kah denge
 Like someone wants to mention about the bar license scam in Kerala
 kuch log kerala ke solar ghotaale ke bare main charchaa karnaa chaahate hai jisamen maujuuda mukhyamantri ko nyaayik ayog kii taraf se ishaara bhi mila he
 The case of bribing by the American company to the previous governments of Goa and Assam is also quite big
 phir hamaare paas uttaranchal main aapadaa raahat ke paise or punarvaas ke ghotaale kii bhi charchaa kerani he
 There is also a land scam in Karnataka
 jaisaa ki automatic rup se spasht hota he ki ye saare ghotaale congressi sarkaron se sambandhit hai
 Is BJP saying that Congress should not tell us the scam or else we will tell them
 kya donon apane-apane ghotaale sweekaar kar rahe hai
 We will ask them
 congress kii bhi lambii suchi he
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in the Lalit Gate case, Union External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in the case of Vyapam, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh in the alleged Rs 36000 crore rice scam
 aakhir is tarah ke iz ikval tu se aap darshak yaa matadaata kya karenge
 Will you forgive the punishment after taking both the guilty
 ye ek nai prakaar kii sazaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also held talks with Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam Singh Yadav near the Speaker's chair before the Lok Sabha proceedings began on Tuesday
 pradhanmantri ne isse pehle kaha ki ummid he ki satr acha chalegaa or vipaksh kaa sahyog milegaa
 But the Congress cleared its line in the Rajya Sabha
 jab tak istipha nahin hoga wo peeche nahin hategi
 After Anand Sharma's statement, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha also aggressively said that Sushma Swaraj is ready to present her side and we are also ready to discuss the issue but the Congress remained firm on the demand for resignation
 congress netaa anand sharma ne bhi vekenya naidu kii tarah bijepi kaa iz ikval tu kar diya
 Anand Sharma asked why the Prime Minister who speaks all over the world does not speak on vyapam-vasundhara
 naam na lete hue bhi anand sharma ji pradhanmantri modi or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke bich iz iklav tu hi kar rahe the
 BJP is accusing Congress that we want discussion and Congress does not want to let the House run
 anand sharma ne kaha ki arun jetali ji ko yaad karwaata hum or sushamaa ji ko
 Not one, but several Parliament sessions were ruined
 sansad kaa record donon kii chhapi hui pustika aap pard sakate hai
 No one could say a word
 ek prashn nahin hua
 a bill was not passed
 or tyaagptr hone ke baad bhi yahi hota rahaa
 Sushma ji has her own statement that if the resignation had taken place earlier, the House would have run
 2013, 2010 ke bayaan dekh lijie
 The comments main soch kar aayaa tha ki main aap darshakon ko iz ikval tu kii theory se thakaa duungaa tabhi anand sharma ke bayaan ke us hisse par pahunchaa jisase laga ki ab bhi bahut maamle main iz ikval tu nahin he
 Anand Sharma said that Venkaiah Naidu will have to tell how what did not happen in the first 10 years happened in a year
 fark ye aayaa he ki 10 saal ye gaiyr jimmevaar vipaksh desh main tha
 b j P
 or ek saal main jo kaam hua uskaa shrey congress ko jaataa he
 So now what should it be said that both parties are blackmailing each other
 iz ikval tu ke pher main sansad funs gai he
 The morality of politics is gone because of no election
 sasuraal main hangaamaa to he magar gaanv ke log kya karen
 Look at the show or add a score to whom it is equal to
 isi iz ikval tu kii avasthaa se bachane ke liye beesvin sadi main lokapal kii kalpana kii gai thi magar ikkisvin sadi main kanoon banane vaale lokapal kaa bhi iz ikval tu ho gaya he
 Now you will ask what the BJP is doing to the Lokpal, then the BJP will say what the Congress was doing
 phir congress kahegi ki hamane to kanoon bana diya tha
 Then the BJP will say that it is not the leader of the opposition and for this it is necessary to change the law and for that it is necessary to run the Parliament
 congress kahegi jaise aap hamaare samay khub sansad chalane dete the
 This way, the game of Is equal to two will continue
 pradhanmantri 26 july ko man kii baat pesh karne vaale hai lekin unki man kii baat kaa asar ye to hua hi he ki bijepi main bhi kai netaa man hi man man kii baat kar rahe hai
 The senior leader and BJP MP said that on July 10, he had spoken to the national president, but the friend managing the Facebook page mistakenly gave the letter to the man with the mind
 shanta kumaar ji apni chitthee ke har shabd ke saath khadey hai magar party main unke saath koi nahin khadaa he
 Shanta Kumar ji, Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy, hurt by the corruption charges leveled against BJP, has made it equal and said that Shanta Kumar has been misled by false propaganda of Congress
 ganimat he ki rudi sahab ne saansad shanta kumaar ko bijepi ke bheetar chipa hua congressi nahin kaha varna iz ikval tu kaa e ples bi kaa hole squaire ho jaataa jiske tahat bijepi ke andar bhi congressi ho sakate hai or congress ke bheetar bhi bhaajapai
 In another prime time show, Vyapam scam whistle blower and RSS veteran Anand Rai was described by one speaker as an agent of Digvijay Singh
 acha he ki is daur main shanta kumaar jaise log hai sochane vaale, kaayade se is chitthee kaa unke kaaryon ke sandarbh main bhi moolyankan ho saktaa tha, phir bhi aisi baat congress ke bheetar se bhi koi kahata to yakeen maaniye uskaa swaagat nahin hota
 Shanta Kumar has written to his national president Amit Shah that fingers have started getting up from Rajasthan to Maharashtra
 - madhya pradesh ke vyaapman ghotaale ne ham sab kaa sir shame se nicha kar diya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party worker is bowing his head
 - meraa suzav he ki ek nai aachaar samiti kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 In this committee, there were experienced and dedicated workers of the party who have never compromised to protect the values
 centre or rajya str par yah samitiyaan ek lokapal kaa kaam karen
 Courage the leaders sitting in power to point out their mistakes at the right time
 maine kaha na ki lokapal kaa iz ikval tu ho gaya he
 How the one who did not come in the country will come to the party
 is bich sansad kaa monsoon satr bilukla usee tarah shuru hua he jisaki charchaa jeth or asadha ke dinon se kii ja rahi thi
 In the morning, under the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu is Equal to Theory, he started giving the message that if the Congress said this, we will say that
 jaise koi kerala main baar license ghotaale ke bare main zikr karnaa chahta he
 Some people want to discuss Kerala's solar scam in which the current Chief Minister has received a hint from the judicial commission
 goa or assam kii purvavarti sarkaron ko america company ke dwaara rishwat dene kaa maamla bhi kaaphi bada he
 Then we have to discuss disaster relief money and rehabilitation scam in Uttaranchal
 karnataka kaa zamin ghotaalaa bhi he
 As it is automatically clear that all these scams are related to the Congress governments
 kya bijepi yah kah rahi he ki congress hamaare ghotaale na bataaye varna ham unke bataa denge
 Are both accepting their respective scams
 ve vil ask dem
 Congress also has a long list
 lalit get maamle main rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje, kendriya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, vyaapman maamle main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, kathith rup se 36000 karod ke chaaval ghotaale ke maamle main chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh
 After all, what would you or the audience do with this type of equal? kya donon ko doshi maanakar sazaa maaf kar denge
 This is a new type of punishment
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi or videsh mantri sushma swaraj ne spikar kii kursi ke nazadik sonia gandhi or mulaayam singh yadav se baatcheet bhi kii
 The Prime Minister earlier said that it is hoped that the session will go well and the opposition will get support
 lekin rajyasabha main congress ne apni line saaf kar di
 She will not back down until she resigns
 anand sharma ke bayaan ke baad rajya sabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne bhi aakraamak tareeke se kaha ki sushma swaraj apana paksh rakhane ke liye taiyaar hai or ham bhi is mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai lekin congress istife kii maang par adi rahi
 Congress leader Anand Sharma also made BJP equal to two, like Vekanya Naidu
 anand sharma ne kaha ki duniya bhar main bolne vaale pradhanmantri vyaapman-vasundhara par kyon nahin bolte hai
 Even without taking names, Anand Sharma was doing the same as two equal between Prime Minister Modi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 bijepi congress par aarope laga rahi he ki ham charchaa chaahate hai or congress sadan chalane nahin dena chaahati
 Anand Sharma said that i remember Arun Jaitley and Sushma ji
 ek nahin balki kai sansad ke satr barbaad kiye gaye
 You can read the printed booklet of both the records of Parliament
 ek shabd nahin koi bol sakaa
 There was not a question
 ek bill paarit nahin hua
 And the same thing happened after resignation
 sushamaa ji kaa apana bayaan he ki agar pehle istife ho jate to sadan chalata
 Look at the 2013, 2010 statement
 tippaniyan i had come to the thought that i would make you viewers tired of the principle of Is equal to only when Anand reached that part of Sharma's statement which still felt that in many cases it is not equal to
 anand sharma ne kaha ki venkaiya naidu ko bataanaa padegaa ki pehle 10 saal main jo nahin hua wo ek saal main kaise ho gaya
 The difference is that 10 years this irresponsible opposition was in the country
 bhaajapa
 And the credit for the work done in a year goes to the Congress
 to ab kya ye kaha jaae ki donon partiyaan ek duusare ko blackmel kar rahi hai
 Parliament is stuck in Is Equal Two
 raajnneeti kii naitikta chunaav na hone ke kaaran maayke chali gai he
 There is uproar in the in-laws but what should the people of the village do
 tamaasha dekhen yaa hisaab jode ki kiskaa kisase iz ikval tu hota he
 The Prime Minister is going to present Mann Ki Baat on 26 July, but the effect of his Mann Ki Baat has already happened that many leaders in BJP are also talking Mana Mana Mana
 varisht netaa or bhaajapa saansad ne bataaya ki 10 july ko unhone rashtriya adhyaksh ji se man kii baat kahi thi lekin fasebuk pej manage karne vaale mitra ne galati se chitthee ko man kii baat se jan kii baat kar di
 Shanta Kumar ji is standing with every word of his letter but no one is standing with him in the party
 bijepi par lagate bhrashtachar ke aaropon se aahat shanta kumaar ji kaa kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne iz ikval tu kar diya he or kaha he ki shanta kumaar congress ke mithyaa prachaaron ke bahekaave main aa gaye hai
 It is worth noting that Rudy Saheb did not call MP Shanta Kumar a Congressman hidden within the BJP or else a equal B's hole would become a square under which Congress can have Congress within BJP and BJP within Congress
 prime time ke ek anya sho main vyaapman ghotaale ke wheasal blor or aresas ke swanyasevak anand raay ko ek vaktaa ne digvijay singh kaa agent kah diya tha
 It is good that people like Shanta Kumar are thinking in this period, this letter could be evaluated in terms of their works, even if someone says such a thing from within the Congress, it is not welcome if you believe it
 shanta kumaar ne apane rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko likhaa he ki rajasthan se lekar maharashtra tak ungliyaan uthne lagi hai
 - The Vyapam Scam of Madhya Pradesh has shamed all of us with shame
 bhartiya janata party kaa kaaryakarta sir jhukaa kar chal rahaa he

 The Prime Minister earlier said that it is hoped that the session will go well and the opposition will get support
 lekin rajyasabha main congress ne apni line saaf kar di
 She will not back down until she resigns
 anand sharma ke bayaan ke baad rajya sabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne bhi aakraamak tareeke se kaha ki sushma swaraj apana paksh rakhane ke liye taiyaar hai or ham bhi is mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai lekin congress istife kii maang par adi rahi
 Congress leader Anand Sharma also made BJP equal to two, like Vekanya Naidu
 anand sharma ne kaha ki duniya bhar main bolne vaale pradhanmantri vyaapman-vasundhara par kyon nahin bolte hai
 Even without taking names, Anand Sharma was doing the same as two equal between Prime Minister Modi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 bijepi congress par aarope laga rahi he ki ham charchaa chaahate hai or congress sadan chalane nahin dena chaahati
 Anand Sharma said that i remember Arun Jaitley and Sushma ji
 ek nahin balki kai sansad ke satr barbaad kiye gaye
 You can read the printed booklet of both the records of Parliament
 ek shabd nahin koi bol sakaa
 There was not a question
 ek bill paarit nahin hua
 And the same thing happened after resignation
 sushamaa ji kaa apana bayaan he ki agar pehle istife ho jate to sadan chalata
 Look at the 2013, 2010 statement
 tippaniyan i had come to the thought that i would make you viewers tired of the principle of Is equal to only when Anand reached that part of Sharma's statement which still felt that in many cases it is not equal to
 anand sharma ne kaha ki venkaiya naidu ko bataanaa padegaa ki pehle 10 saal main jo nahin hua wo ek saal main kaise ho gaya
 The difference is that 10 years this irresponsible opposition was in the country
 bhaajapa
 And the credit for the work done in a year goes to the Congress
 to ab kya ye kaha jaae ki donon partiyaan ek duusare ko blackmel kar rahi hai
 Parliament is stuck in Is Equal Two
 raajnneeti kii naitikta chunaav na hone ke kaaran maayke chali gai he
 There is uproar in the in-laws but what should the people of the village do
 tamaasha dekhen yaa hisaab jode ki kiskaa kisase iz ikval tu hota he
 i said that Lokpal's is equal to two
 jo desh main nahin aayaa wo party main kaise aa jayega
 Meanwhile, the monsoon session of Parliament has started in a similar manner which was being discussed since the days of Jeth and Ashada
 subah subah sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu iz ikval tu theory ke tahat sandesh dene lage ki agar congress ne ye kaha to ham wo kah denge
 Like someone wants to mention about the bar license scam in Kerala
 kuch log kerala ke solar ghotaale ke bare main charchaa karnaa chaahate hai jisamen maujuuda mukhyamantri ko nyaayik ayog kii taraf se ishaara bhi mila he
 The case of bribing by the American company to the previous governments of Goa and Assam is also quite big
 phir hamaare paas uttaranchal main aapadaa raahat ke paise or punarvaas ke ghotaale kii bhi charchaa kerani he
 There is also a land scam in Karnataka
 jaisaa ki automatic rup se spasht hota he ki ye saare ghotaale congressi sarkaron se sambandhit hai
 Is BJP saying that Congress should not tell us the scam or else we will tell them
 kya donon apane-apane ghotaale sweekaar kar rahe hai
 We will ask them
 congress kii bhi lambii suchi he
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in the Lalit Gate case, Union External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in the case of Vyapam, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh in the alleged Rs 36000 crore rice scam
 aakhir is tarah ke iz ikval tu se aap darshak yaa matadaata kya karenge
 Will you forgive the punishment after taking both the guilty
 ye ek nai prakaar kii sazaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also held talks with Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam Singh Yadav near the Speaker's chair before the Lok Sabha proceedings began on Tuesday
 pradhanmantri ne isse pehle kaha ki ummid he ki satr acha chalegaa or vipaksh kaa sahyog milegaa
 But the Congress cleared its line in the Rajya Sabha
 jab tak istipha nahin hoga wo peeche nahin hategi
 After Anand Sharma's statement, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha also aggressively said that Sushma Swaraj is ready to present her side and we are also ready to discuss the issue but the Congress remained firm on the demand for resignation
 congress netaa anand sharma ne bhi vekenya naidu kii tarah bijepi kaa iz ikval tu kar diya
 Anand Sharma asked why the Prime Minister who speaks all over the world does not speak on vyapam-vasundhara
 naam na lete hue bhi anand sharma ji pradhanmantri modi or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke bich iz iklav tu hi kar rahe the
 BJP is accusing Congress that we want discussion and Congress does not want to let the House run
 anand sharma ne kaha ki arun jetali ji ko yaad karwaata hum or sushamaa ji ko
 Not one, but several Parliament sessions were ruined
 sansad kaa record donon kii chhapi hui pustika aap pard sakate hai
 No one could say a word
 ek prashn nahin hua
 a bill was not passed
 or tyaagptr hone ke baad bhi yahi hota rahaa
 Sushma ji has her own statement that if the resignation had taken place earlier, the House would have run
 2013, 2010 ke bayaan dekh lijie
 The comments main soch kar aayaa tha ki main aap darshakon ko iz ikval tu kii theory se thakaa duungaa tabhi anand sharma ke bayaan ke us hisse par pahunchaa jisase laga ki ab bhi bahut maamle main iz ikval tu nahin he
 Anand Sharma said that Venkaiah Naidu will have to tell how what did not happen in the first 10 years happened in a year
 fark ye aayaa he ki 10 saal ye gaiyr jimmevaar vipaksh desh main tha
 b j P
 or ek saal main jo kaam hua uskaa shrey congress ko jaataa he
 So now what should it be said that both parties are blackmailing each other
 iz ikval tu ke pher main sansad funs gai he
 The morality of politics is gone because of no election
 sasuraal main hangaamaa to he magar gaanv ke log kya karen
 Look at the show or add a score to whom it is equal to
 jaise koi kerala main baar license ghotaale ke bare main zikr karnaa chahta he
 Some people want to discuss Kerala's solar scam in which the current Chief Minister has received a hint from the judicial commission
 goa or assam kii purvavarti sarkaron ko america company ke dwaara rishwat dene kaa maamla bhi kaaphi bada he
 Then we have to discuss disaster relief money and rehabilitation scam in Uttaranchal
 karnataka kaa zamin ghotaalaa bhi he
 As it is automatically clear that all these scams are related to the Congress governments
 kya bijepi yah kah rahi he ki congress hamaare ghotaale na bataaye varna ham unke bataa denge
 Are both accepting their respective scams
 ve vil ask dem
 Congress also has a long list
 lalit get maamle main rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje, kendriya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, vyaapman maamle main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, kathith rup se 36000 karod ke chaaval ghotaale ke maamle main chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh
 After all, what would you or the audience do with this type of equal? kya donon ko doshi maanakar sazaa maaf kar denge
 This is a new type of punishment
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi or videsh mantri sushma swaraj ne spikar kii kursi ke nazadik sonia gandhi or mulaayam singh yadav se baatcheet bhi kii

 a report in the Chinese website Global Times accused India of sparking the Doklam dispute and increasing its military presence by entering into China's border
 global times ke anusaar bharat aisa dakshin asia main apana prabhaav banaae rakhane ke liye kar rahaa he
 According to the report, it is clear from the Modi government's aggression on this issue that India wants to increase diplomatic opposition with China
 pakistan se dosti kii baat sweekarimedia report main saaf kaha gaya he ki china pakistan ke dosti ko badhaava de rahaa he or china-pakistan economic coridor kii vajah se unke rishte or majboot hue hai
 Not only Pakistan, China has also improved its relations with Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives and other countries of South Asia
 report main kaha gaya ki modi se pehle bharat kii aarthik or rashtriya shakti main teji se vikaas hua
 However, the power of China has increased rapidly during this period
 ab china tivrata se dakshin asia main apana prabhaav badha rahaa he or yahi baat bharat ko pareshaan kar rahi he
 Khatki According to a media report from the US, India is taking advantage of the confrontation between China and America
 report main kaha gaya ki bharat apni badhati aarthik shakti kii vajah se beijing or nai dilli ke dwipaksheeya rishton main khatas daal rahaa he or is kshetra main bad rahe china ke dabadabe ko rokane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 According to the report, this is the reason that now after few days of friendship with the Chinese government, PM Narendra Modi is pushing both the countries in dispute
 yahi nahin report main saaf kaha gaya ki bharat akele china ko nahin roak saktaa
 This is the reason why he is now trying to get help from America and Japan
 report main doklam vivaad ke samay par bhi sawaal uthaa gaya
 It has been said that Modi's return from the US tour and the commencement of the Doklam controversy after that is not a coincidence
 bharat america kii us kootnithik laalasaa kaa phayda uthaanaa chaah rahaa he, jiske anusaar washington bharat kaa istemaal china ko control or check karne ke liye karnaa chahta he
 At the same time, India's diplomatic thinking is also to increase Malabar drill, nuclear and military relations with Japan
 rajnatik halaat par bhi tippaneereport main hamaare desh kii raajnneetik halaat par bhi vipareet tippanee kii gai he
 It was said that in India's current political climate, it is easier to compete with China than to promote friendship
 aise main modi sarkaar ne bhi china ke saath muqabla karne kaa nirnay liya, jisase ki vah dakshin asia main apana prabhaav banaae rakh sake
 According to the report, India is not limited to the china-china Doklam dispute and other border disputes
 yahi nahin agar is samay upje vivaad kaa shantipurna samaadhaan ho bhi jaataa he to bhi bharat or china ke rishte jald sudharne vaale nahin hai
 In the coming times, there will also be a dispute between the two countries on other political and military issues

 congress samet kai vipakshi daltin talakamen sanshodhan kii maang kar rahe hai, jabaki modi sarkaar isamen kisi tarah kaa badlaav nahin karnaa chaahati he
 Many Muslim organizations are also opposing the Modi government's triple talaq bill
 in muslim sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki modi sarkaar unke dharmik maamle main dakhal de rahi he, jabaki isse pehle supreme court bhi centre sarkaar se teen talaak par kanoon banane ko kah chuki he
 The Supreme Court has even stated that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women
 vahiin, maamle main modi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki yah bill muslim mahilaon ke hit main hai
 The triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women

 Was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Gumnami Baba the same person? Did Netaji live as an anonymous baba in Faizabad at the end of his life as an anonymous Baba? Or was Gumnami Baba Netaji very special? Almost 75 years after the death of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the answers to these questions are now going to be public
 upi cabinet ne gumnami baba ke sach kaa pataa lagane ke liye gathit justise vishnu sahay cameti kii report ko vidhansabha main rakhane ke faisle ko apni manjuuri de di he
 17 September 1985 This story begins on this date
 jab faizabad main gumnami baba kii achaanak maut ho jaati he
 Two days after the death, Gumnami Baba is cremated on the banks of the Saryu River at Guftar Ghat in Faizabad at around 4 pm on 19 September 1985
 magar haroonges taur par unka cheharaa kisi ko dekhne nahin diya gaya
 It is said that after death and before the last rites, an attempt was made to spoil the oblivious Baba's face with a chemical
 taaki chehre kii shinaakht naa ho sake
 Gumnami Before Baba's death, his life was a kind of anonymity
 isaki vajah ye thi ki gumnami baba behad rahasyamayi tareeke se rahaa karte the
 Common people could not even see his face
 thode-thode vakt par kiraye kaa ghar badalte rahete the
 Even his personal servants were changed every few months
 lekin tab bhi sab thik tha
 Suspicion and questions arise Gumnami Two days after Baba's death
 faizabad shahar ke civil lines main bane ram bhawan main gumnami baba ne aakhri saansen lee thi
 Two days after his death, when the servants searched the house, for the first time a rumor went out of Faizabad and reached every corner of the country
 darasal, kai baxon main band saamaan jab baahar nikaala gaya to achaanak charchaa shuru ho gai ki gumnami baba koi or nahin balki netaji subhash chandra bose the
 Now the question was if the leader was Gumnami Baba, then who died in a plane crash in 1945? Because even the Government of India had said that Netaji had died in a plane crash
 or aakhir wo saamaan kya tha jo gumnami baba ko netaa ji bataa rahaa tha? to sabase pehle gumnami baba ke bakse se baraamad saamaan par ek nazar daalate hai
 The stuff which was found by Gumnami Baba
 usamen kolkata main har saal 23 janvari ko manaae jane vaale netaji ke janmotsav kii tasviren thi
 There were photographs of mourning meetings on the death of Leela Roy
 netaji kii tarah ke darjanon gol chashme the
 There were 555 cigarettes and foreign liquor
 subhash chandra bose ke mata-pita or parivaar kii nijee tasviren bhi thi
 There was a Rolex pocket watch and a uniform of the Azad Hind Army
 iske alaava 1974 main kolkata ke dainik anand bazaar patrika main 24 kishton main chhapi khabaren thim
 Numerous books of German, Japanese and English literature were also found
 bharat-china yuddh sambandhi kitaaben main vahaan se mili jinke pannon par tippaniyan likhi gayi thim
 Reports of Shahnawaz and Khosla Commission made to investigate the death of Subhash Chandra Bose, hundreds of telegrams and letters etc
 which were addressed in the name of Bhagwanji
 yahi nahin haath se bane hue us jagah ke naqshe bhi baraamad hue the, jahaan netaji kaa vimaan krash hua tha
 Congratulations to the Holy Mohan Roy, head of the intelligence wing of the Azad Hind Fauj, were also recovered
 jab ye sara saamaan ek saath baraamad hua to dhire-dhire gumnami baba kii kahaniyaan mashhoor hone lagi
 All the eyewitnesses started coming forward
 phir ek ahm baat kaa pataa chalaa ki uttar bharat kaa ek aam gumnami baba bhala german, angreji, japani or bengali bhashaa itani dharapravaah kaise bol saktaa tha
 And all these were the same words that the leader said
 lihaaza ab tay hua ki netaji ke faijabad pahunchane kii kahani samajhi jaae
 After all, when, how and from where did he come here? According to the locals of Faizabad, Gumnami Baba or Bhagwanji reached there in the 70s
 shuruyaat main wo ayodhya kii lalkothi main bataur kirayedar rahaa karte the
 Then after a few days they started going to the township
 lekin basti unhen bahut raas nahin ai or gumnami baba waapas ayodhya lautakar pandit ramkishor panda ke ghar rahane lage
 Then a few years later, his next stop was the Lucknowwa Hata in the center of the Ayodhya vegetable market
 jahaan ve behad gupt tareeke se rahe
 At the last moment, Gumnami Baba lived in a two-room house in Ram Bhawan, Faizabad
 jahaan unki maut hui
 After the death of Gumnami Baba, some such things also came out with the goods, about which people started to believe that Gumnami Baba was the only leader
 gumnami baba faijabad kaise pahunche, kahaan se aae kisi ko pakke taur par nahin pataa tha
 Why did Gumnami Baba always live in a very secretive way everywhere? Why did Gumnami Baba not show his face to anyone? Who were those people who used to come secretly to meet Gumnami Baba on 23 January and Durga Puja every year? 23 January is the birthday of Netaji
 in do maukon par baba ke nijee sevakon ko bhi unase milane kyon nahin diya jaataa? agar gumnami baba jangalon main dhyanarat ek sant the to itani farrotedaar angreji or german kaise bolte the? gumnami baba ke paas duniya bhar ke namchin akhbaar, patrikaayen, sahitya, cigarette or sharaab koun pahunchaata tha? maut ke baad gumnami baba kaa gupachup tareeke se antim sanskaar kyon kiya gaya?17 sitambar 1985 ko raat saadhe nau se das baje ke bich jab gumnami baba ne aakhri saanse leen tab unke saath sirf unki sevika jagdambe or sevak krishna gopal shrivastav the
 It is said that after Baba's death, his servants fought among themselves over the possession of their property and inheritance, and the two locked their rooms separately
 baba ke paas 22 bade-bade sandook the
 In which all the stuff was kept
 haalanki is dauraan sthaneey prashasan ne unke ghar par paharaa laga diya
 It is claimed that every 23 January certain people from Kolkata used to visit Netaji to celebrate Netaji's birthday while Baba was alive
 lekin unki maut ke baad unke sevakon ke ittila bhejne ke baad bhi unamem se koi baba ke antim darshan karne yaa antim sanskaar main hissaa lene nahin aayaa
 It is said that after two days of waiting, the body of Gumnami Baba was secretly taken to Guftar Ghat and cremated near the company garden in the presence of the army and top officials of the administration
 logon ko ye baat hairaan kar rahi thi
 Because no ordinary person can be cremated in a military area
 gumnami baba ke baad phir vahaan kisi kaa antim sanskaar nahin kiya gaya
 It is alleged that his face was spoiled by putting some chemicals before the funeral
 aisa kyon kiya gaya, yaa kiya bhi gaya yaa nahin ye ab tak saaf nahin ho paaya he
 It is said that after the death of Gumnami Baba, the talk of her being Netaji started spreading, Netaji's niece Lalitha Bose came from Faizabad from Kolkata and after seeing the goods recovered from Gumnami Baba's room, she said that it was her uncle's
 iske baad gumnami baba ke hi netaji hone kii jaanch ke liye kai jagah pradarshan hue
 The government came on the backfoot for a long time and the Mukherjee Commission was formed to investigate the matter
 haalanki ye sabit nahin ho paaya ki gumnami baba hi netaa ji the
 After this, two more commissions were formed for this investigation but all refused to consider Gumnami Baba as the leader

 Everything that should be in a film is in it

 shuddh desi romance kahani he ek ladke raghu kii, jo jaipur main rahata he or paryaton udyog ko gati detaa hue firangiyon ko gole pilaataa he
 Raghu is getting married to Tara, but he gets confused in An Last
 or ab jab ho hi gaya, to bhai sahab cat lete hai
 The cut happens and people are singing songs of love with Gayatri in their own procession
 magar kanfusion yahaan bhi peeth par batal kii tarah savaar rahata he
 There is another cut and things rewind a bit
 to phir gayatri gon or tara on
 But the Lotto of life does not stop there, where even if you raise your hand, things do not come
 aakhir main vaisaa hi kuch hota he or sili lav life ek jaruri lesan paati he

 raghu aaj ke vakt kaa balak he
 Ours like you
 jise jab pyaar hota he, to aisa ki lagata he ki bas abhi do chaar taj mahal kharch kar do is mumtaj kaa munh haa bolne ke liye khulwaane ko
 Sushant Singh Rajput has reinforced the belief that the industry has got the next lover boy
 ye boy cheez yaa butter jaisaa ati chikna or phislan bharaa nahin he
 It is like a silhouette with some roughness etched in the middle of a solid smoothness, so that the sauce is spicy and fun
 sushant raghu ke har rang ko jinda karte hai
 Raghu who says yes to everything to impress a girl
 ladki ke bare main jaraa si ulti sidhi baat sunakar ghunnane vaala rivyuu or ladki jab chali jaae to agali kii taiyaari main jutata raghu
 But as soon as the first one arrives, Raghu is like a child eating current
 bahut hi umdaa acting
 Means a bittersweet mix of cute and dashing
 4 pariniti chopra hamaare vakt kii kaajol hai
 The light chubby, height is also not a model c cursory
 aawaaj bhi radio waalon si prafational nahin
 But in all this rawness, there is a fervent truth
 unhone gayatri ke rup main aaj ke vakt kii ladki ko jism bakhsha he
 a girl who is away from the father because she has to live life in her own way
 jo umr kii jaruraton ko pyaar ke saath misamatch nahin karti
 Who loves, does not spend much time to kiss or make decisions
 jo sutta maarthi he, magar kisi bade ke kehane par use kuch der ke liye multavee bhi kar detii he
 Which does not weight the boy's initiative for the breakup
 5 film kaa sarprise or surila sa package hai vaani kapur
 Between the two supposed actors, they have woven their own different colors
 kabhi shokh, kabhi sakht
 Tara is also the girl of today, so she does not cover the color that has gone out of neglect
 jab vaani kapur shokh kesaria rang kii sari pahanakar haath main coke pakad bas par chadhati hai, to aap us bas main bagal kii khaali seat talashne lagate hai
 When she stumbles as she goes, you start giving way to another smile
 badhiya acting
 It was not felt from anywhere that for the first time Mohatrama is coming on the big screen
 or haa camera bhi khush ho jaataa he aisi beauty ke har angel ko kaid karne main
 6 These three children have taught some new lessons of acting by Sadde Uncle Rishi Kapoor
 yahaan par vah shaadi karwaane vaale bujurg vyapaaree goyal ji bane hai
 Catering business, but Rajasthani color style
 rishi aise acting kar rahe hai, jaise second ining main har role se khud ko nae sire se sabit karne kii ziddee dhun paal baithe hon
 Eating gatta vegetables, handling dhoti, drying tea and looking down on the slopes of glasses among them, they saw the new generation thriving below them and Goyal ji sometimes managed
 unhen dekh lagata he ki kya yaar, bujurg itane hi kool kyon nahin ho sakate sabake
 7 Now the matter of the person who brought this reign in his womb and then gave it to the world

 Jaideep, a resident of Lajpat Nagar in Delhi, is a prince of the middle class, who gets an anecdote from the nuanced details
 isiilie unki kahani main har vakt aap kisi kirdaar main kisi jaan pahchaan vaale ko or aksar khud ko khojate or mahasooste najar aate hai
 In pure desi romance, no character appears or speaks simply and for a storyteller, there can be no greater work or leisure than producing a false truth equal to the true world
 8 diarector manish sharma ne band baaja baraat se jo ummid jagaai thi, use yahaan nae par laga die hai
 Since he is of the same age, there is a sharpness in the way he shows his anecdote, which gets stuck on the tongue
 is lav story main sab kuch itane kanvising tareeke se hua he, ki aapako kabhi bhi kahani ke bich ruk kisi abhi abhi hui cheez ke liye koi vajah talashne kii jarurat nahin padati
 The film also features songs, some slow pause type moments

 9 The film has four songs, all four entice
 tere mere bich main kya he, ek aisi chuhal bhari bansuri kii tarah he, jo har khaali vakt main bahati hawa ke saath gaanon ko yaad aa jaati he
 The evening gives voice to those immortal moments of love that make a few moments stay at the highest place of the Pink City
 random romens is mechap brallep jenereshan ke kuch falsafe bayaan karti he
 And finally when you leave satisfied, the title track of Shuddh Desi Romance rings
