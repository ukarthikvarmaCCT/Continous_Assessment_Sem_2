 Party strategists believe that instead of negative publicity, returning to the strategy adopted in the 2015 assembly elections is the need of the hour
 pichley chunaav main jis tarah party ne 49 din kii sarkaar ke kaamon ko janata ke samaksh rakhkar sakaaratmak prachaar kar aitihaasik bahumat hasil kiya tha, usee tarahanigam chunaav main bhi party kejariwal sarkaar ke do saal ke kaamkaaj ko prachaar kaa hissaa banaaya he
 Not only this, in the wake of bjp's victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand recently, AAP has avoided targeting Nemodi
 party ke ranneetikaron ko lagata he ki dilli main uttar pradesh or uttarakhand ke matadaataaon kii baari sankhya ko dekhte hue modi virodh kaa asar ulta pad saktaa he
 This increases the risk of public anger towards AAP
 party ne modi ko nishaanaa banane ke ab tak ke anubhav se sabak lete hue prachaar kii ranneeti ko lekar yutern liya he
 Party leaders have started to believe that even in the last Lok Sabha election, the only propaganda policy revolved around Modi's opposition was that the party's victory was reduced to only four seats in Punjab and all the candidates including Kejriwal lost the election
 natijatan ab aap ne nigam chunaav main sirf kejariwal sarkaar ke behatar kaamon ko prachaar ke centre main rakhaa he

 In Haryana, the Bhupendra Singh Hooda-led Congress faced a crushing defeat
 lekin hooda ab bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi se apni tulana karne se hichak nahin rahe
 In an advertisement published on Monday, the former Chief Minister has described himself as the 'chief Servant' of the public
 yaad rahe ki narendra modi akasar khud ko pradhanmantri nahin, pradhan sevak kehete rahe hai
 Actually, Bhupendra Singh Hooda has thanked the people of the state by advertising in newspapers
 isi vigyaapan main unhone khud ko mukhyamantri ke bajaae 'mukhya sevak' sambodhit kiya he
 It is worth noting that Hooda has been dismissing the claims of development of Gujarat in the past and has called Haryana as the number one state
 vigyaapan main hooda ne kaha ki unke shasankaal main haryana ne vikaas kii nai bulandiyon ko chuaa he or unhone iske liye bharpoor prayaas kiya he
 He also said that this new mandate of the people is acceptable to him and he hopes that the coming generations will remember the journey of progress
 unhone nai sarkaar ko shubhakamanaayen bhi deen
 This will probably be the first time that a Chief Minister has thanked the public through an advertisement after a defeat
 lekin iske saath hi yah sawaal bhi khadaa hoga ki chunaav aachaar samhita ke lagu hone ke kaaran is vigyaapan kaa kharch kis khate main jayega

 The charge sheet prepared by the Muzaffarnagar police against BJP President Amit Shah has been returned by the local court
 adaalat ne chargeshit main aavashyak suchanaaen nahin hone ke kaaran ise adhuraa maanate hue lautaa diya
 The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) directed the investigating officer to complete the lack of facts and present the charge sheet again
 atirikt mukhya nyaayik magistrate sundar laal ne amit shah ke khilaaf chargeshit kaa sangyaan lene se inkaar kar diya, kyonki police ne aapraadhik dand prakriya samhita kii dhara 173 (2) ke praavdhaanon kaa anupaalan nahin kiya tha
 Under this, an attempt is made to arrest the accused before filing the chargesheet in the court
 adaalat ne kaha ki police ne aapraadhik dand prakriya samhita kii dhara 173 (2) ke praavdhaanon ke tahat warrant yaa kurki prakriya kaa aagrah nahin kiya
 The court, while returning the charge sheet for removal of the error, said that the police cannot file a charge sheet under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, as it would have to be filed as a private complaint on behalf of the officer concerned, who enforced the prohibition and violated it

 Police had registered a case against Amit Shah on the instructions of the Election Commission for alleged violation of the model code of conduct
 ayog ne 4 april, 2014 ko shah par uttar pradesh main prachaar karne se roak bhi laga di thi
 Significantly, Amit Shah got into controversy when he allegedly said that the 2014 Lok Sabha election is an opportunity to 'avenge the humiliation' of the riots in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh last year
 shah kii 'badla' vaali tippanee par dhyaan dete hue chunaav ayog ne unhen aachaar samhita ke pratham drushtya ulanghan ke liye notice jari kiya tha
 Shah had denied the violation of the code of conduct and asked the Election Commission to reconsider the notice issued to him

 The ban on them was later lifted

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has been the target of critics after the embarrassing 1-2 defeat in the Test series at the hands of England, refused to comment on the discussion about appointing a separate captain for a different format
 dhoni se jab is sambandh main chal rahi charchaa ke bare main poocha to unka sidhaa jawaab tha, ‘aapkaa sawaal mujhe lagata he ki alag praaroop ke liye alag captain se judaa he lekin abhi tii-20 praaroop kii baat karen kyonki hamen kal tii-20 match khelnaa he
 'dhoni wanted to get rid of this issue and the proof of this was again found when he responded to the British journalist in the same strict manner
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘is mahatvapurn siries ke shuru hone se pehle main is par tippanee nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Because when everything is not favorable when it comes to Indian cricket, questions start to arise about captaincy, senior players, junior players and the skills and bench strength that we have

 You may have noticed that the bowlers, especially the spinners, performed well even though they were not getting much help from the wicket

 gujarat rajyasabha kii teen siton kaa chunaav kaaphi dilachasp ban gaya
 The BJP has trapped Chanakya of the Congress in the Chakravyuh by taking such a siege in the state
 gujarat main party puri tarah se bikhar chuki he, kai vidhayak to pehle hi party ko alavida bol chuke hai
 After the vote today, two mlas have said to vote for the BJP, while the BJP is sure of winning the three Rajya Sabha seats of the state
 gujarat se lekar dilli tak rajyasabha chunaav kii sargarmi bani hui he
 Read what the leaders of both parties said here
 
 
 
 Congress leaders are assuming that Ahmed Patel's victory in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election is sure
 congress pravaktaa randeep surejwaala ne kaha- congress nirvaachit vidhayak ahamed patel ji kii jeet sunishchit karenge
 But many Congress mlas have rebelled
 inhen main se gujarat ke congressi baagi vidhayakshankar singh waghelane kaha- jab congress jeetne vaali he hi nahin he to congress ko vot dene kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 i have not voted for the Congress
 ahamed patel jeetenge nahin, aise main ahamed bhai kii saakh ko daanv par congress ko nahin lagaana chahie tha
 The BJP is troubled by the three Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay rupani ne kaha ki gujarat kii teenon rajyasabha siton par hamaari jeet sunishchit he
 Congress's ally NCP is also believing that many Congress mlas will betray the party
 ensipi netaa majid memon ne kaha ki aisi sthiti ahamed patel kii vajah se bani he, congress ke hi aadhe log bijepi ke liye vot kar sakate hai, lekin ensipi kaa samarthancongress ke baagi vidhayak hakubhai jadeja ne kaha ki raajnneeti main rahanaa he, to congress main ab nahin rahanaa
 There are only two parties in Gujarat
 desh dhire dhire congress mukt ho rahaa he, aise main agar hamen raajnneeti main apane aapako barkaraar rakhana he, to congress main nahin rahanaa hoga, congress ke 44 vidhayakon main se bhi teen chaar vidhayak cross voting karenge
 While Ahmed Patel, contesting from the Congress quota, said - i am very optimistic, i and my party are confident that we will win, waiting for the result
 sharad yadav ke kareebi maane jane vaale gujarat main jediu ke vidhayak chotu bhai vasava ne vot daalaa
 The Congress hopes that the lone ZU MLA will support him
 jabaki jedyu vidhayak vasava ne matdaan ke baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki maine party kii vichaardhaara ko vot diya he Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor's much awaited film Saaho is eagerly awaited by the audience
 is film ko saal kii sabase badi ection film bhi mana ja rahaa he
 Shraddha Kapoor will also be seen doing action stunts along with Prabhas in the film
 haalanki isse pehle bhi shraddha kapur film baagi main ection seens karte najar aa chuki hai
 But the level of action in this film will be quite high
 ve is film main krime branch officer amrutha naiyar kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai
 Apparently, he had to use his gun heavily in the film, but it was not that easy for Shraddha
 shraddha kapur ne kaha ki mujhe bandook thaamne kaa abhyast hona padaa, kyonki wo kaaphi baari thi
 When you take a gun in hand, the pressure comes on your wrists
 agar aap meri kalai dekhoge to aapako ehsaas hoga ki meri kalaaiyaan bandook thaamne ke liye strong nahin hai or ve vaaki nahin thim
 Shraddha said, when i started to hold the gun fresh, my hands were in pain and there was uncomfortable feeling in my hands
 kalaayiyon ko majboot karne ke liye maine eksrasise shuru kii thi or main apni kalaayiyon main tepe baandh liya karti thi taaki mere haath majboot bane rahen
 After a few days of training, i used to keep moving the gun comfortably on the set in my hands and at times it seemed that it was part of my hands

 On Christmas Eve the brightness of Delhi's markets doubled
 dilli ke sabhi pramukh bazaar public place evam mal roshni se jagamaga uthe
 By evening, most of the families were seen taking selfies on the backdrop adorned with their children and the different activities and discounts in the mall also kept the people tied

 Amidst all these, at the DLF Place Mall in Saket, Ledy Santane won the hearts of all

 But on the contrary, this lady Santa of DLF was seen taking a selfie with the children and distributing chocolate to them
 santa klojko khubasurat mahila ke swaroop main kalpana karnaa mushkil he, lekin is ladi santa ko dekh aisa lag rahaa tha jaise santa cloj kaa ye swaroop bhi ho saktaa he
 This Lady Santa of Delhi won the hearts of all the children
 christmas ke bahaane log gharon se baahar nikle
 Amidst the news of smog and pollution, people were seen having fun with their children after a long time

 Watching Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal perch on the couch in the outer waiting room of lg's residence
 upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya or swasthya mantri satyendra jain ko bhukh hadtaal par jate dekhnaa
 When the two people were rushed to the hospital, critics slammed into the nostril, a very dramatic maneuver
 mamata banerjee se lekar chandrababu naidu tak or pinarai vijayan se lekar seetaram yechuri, akhilesh yadav or siyaasi nausikhue camel hasan tak vibhinn netaaon ko kejariwal ke samarthan main bolte dekhnaa or unhen aise vakt main maujuun or praasangik bana dena, jab ve ek chalata-phirata majaak banane ke khatre se ghire the—dedh pasli kaa jawan pahalwaan ko hameshaa chunauti detaa rahaa he
 AAP claimed to be the winner from these nine days
 stanbhakaar or saamaajik tippaneekar santosh desai is dharne ko ‘jokhim bharaa magar ranneetik taur par thos kadam’ kehete hai
 He argues that every day the 'cold War of Grisai' was turned into a 'spirited battle'
 duusare lafjon main aap ne phode main bhaalaa ghonp diya
 According to Atishi Marlena, an AAP senior activist and an all-round accolade in improving the condition of Delhi's schools, the so-called dharna was 'important' because it brought out how to "misuse lg's office at the hands of the Center" Had been
 ’’ve maanati hai ki dilli ke matadaataaon kaa ek khaas bada hissaa is baat ko samajhataa he ki ‘‘aap sarkaar ke kaam main rukaawatein daali ja rahi hai or haalanki ham asardaar hai, par agar ham in rukaawaton se mukt hote to kai guna zyada asardaar ho sakate the
 It is of course impossible to prove this
 teen baar dilli kii mukhyamantri rah chukin shila dikshit sareekhe kuch log is baat ko hansi main uda dete hai
 He told reporters that his government had also demanded full statehood for Delhi, but did not use it as a political defense
 ve boleen, ‘‘hamane ise vikaas kaa apana kaam nahin kar paane kaa bahaanaa nahin banaaya
 "she said that in 1998 when she was the Chief Minister, the BJP was still in power at the Center and then she could achieve her goals without unnecessary confrontation
" kejariwal ne is aarope kaa jawaab diya, haalanki ghuma-firaakar
 He claimed that he did not have the strength like Dixit
 pradhanmantri ko sambodhit ek chitthee main kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki agar modi ne ‘2015 ke ek aadesh ke jariye’ dilli kii pichhali sarkaron ko hasil adhikaar aap sarkaar se ‘chin’ na liye hote, to ‘‘ham iees afasaron kii hadtaal kii shikaayat lekar aapke paas nahin aate
 We would have found our way ourselves
 aaj saare adhikaar aapke paas hai or sari jimmedaariyaan hamaare upar hai
 How will this work? ”this is a sinful question
 kyonki jaisaa ki hadataalen—chaahe ve afasarshahon kii hon yaa dilli sarkaar kii—dikhaa chuki hai ki hadataalen kaam nahin aatin
 Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken has also sharply criticized the aap's 'unproven dharna politics'
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek twit main is dharne ko ‘araajaktaa’ qaraar diya
 He wrote, "on one hand, this drama is going on and the people of Delhi are falling prey to it
 ’’ congress mushkil halaat main ghir gai he—dilli main aap kii virdohi hone ke naate vah uske dharne kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati thi, par usne is sambhaavna ke daravaaje bhi khol die ki congress ke bagaiyr vipakshi ekta mumkin he or yah maanakar nahin chalaa ja saktaa ki modi or bhaajapa ke khilaaf sanyukt vipaksh kii aguai congress hi karegi
 Says Marlena, Congress has shown that its petty political tactics and cleverness to look better than others dominate the principles
 ve bataati hai ki puduccheri main congress kii sarkaar kaa adanghe daalane vaali or tuchh siyasat karne vaali uparajyapal ke khilaaf lagaataar shikaayatein karnaa congress ke dhong or paakhand kii misaal he
 "in Delhi, the Congress and the BJP function like a symphony orchestra," says Marlena
 yah khalis siyaasi avasarwaad he
 "desai also says that there is no longer a reputation in the Congress for making clear statements about" intricate facts
 ’’ aap ke purv diggaj or ab nai siyaasi party swaraj india ke adhyaksh yogendra yadav aap kii naakaamiyon or ‘rajkaaj ke vyakaran or yahaan tak ki sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii jaankaree’ ke uske abhaav kii tikhi aalochana karte hai
 But Yadav also agrees that LG appears to be acting in a spirit of malice
 apana naam ujagar karne ke anicchhuk aap ke ek bhitari shaks ke mutabik, ‘‘alji kaa gurur—yahaan tak ki ab takaraav khatm hone ke baad bhi—mukhyamantri ke saath mulaakaat karne se unke inkaar se saaf jaahir hoti he
 IAS officers follow at the behest of LG and LG at the behest of the Center
 yah bair-bhav abhootpurv he
 "this means that the end of the current confrontation is merely covering the cracks
" dilli bhaajapa ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari kehete hai, ‘‘koi nahin jaanata, kejariwal dharne par baithne kaa aglaa faisla kab karenge
 Nobody knows why they were sitting on the dharna to the top and what they achieved
 ’’asardaar tareeke se apana dharna khatm karke alji ke ghar se kejariwal ke rukhsat hone ke mahaj kuch hi ghante baad aap ke purv mantri somnath bharti ne kaha ki ve or duusare vidhayakon ne alji se milane kii koshish kii thi, par police ne unhen apni paharedaari main parisar se baahar nikaal diya
 Angry Kejriwal asked on Twitter, "what is going on, why are LG mlas, mps, Ministers, refusing to meet the Chief Minister?" Do the lgs know that it is their constitutional duty to meet them? They have no choice but to meet them
 yah ajeeb he
 "that is why AAP is running such a fierce campaign to give the state status to the national capital
 party ke ek pramukh kaaryakarta or pravaktaa raghav chaddha ne dharne ko ‘pehali jeet’ kaha, jisaki badi jang abhi honi he
 On 11 June, the Delhi Legislative Assembly passed a resolution demanding full statehood status to Delhi
 yah ek pratikatmak kadam tha
 In an article published in the newspaper, Yadav wrote that 'delhi deserves full statehood
 ’ marlena kahati hai ki centre sarkaar endiemasi (nai dilli municipal korporation) ke ilaake, lutiuns kii dilli or diplomatic acklev par apana puraa niyantran rakh sakati he, par ‘‘baaki shahar kii 2 karod logon kii apni sarkaar honi chahie jo unke prati or keval unke prati javabdeh ho
 "in November 2017, in the arguments put in the Supreme Court, the lawyers of the Center had said that the Union Territories cannot be converted into full-fledged states, they are governed by the President (who appoints LG) and especially the executive authority in Delhi
 Due to national security, they cannot be handed over completely to the Delhi government
 magar dilli main bhaajapa barason se purna rajya kii maang karti rahi he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the party issued a manifesto for the capital and included a demand for a full state
 kendriya mantri harshavardhan us vakt dilli bhaajapa adhyaksh the or yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki april 2014 main unhone kaha tha, ‘‘yah chunaav narendra modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri banane ke liye ladaa ja rahaa he, (or) ham unase pehali maang yah karenge ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja den
 "that promise was wiped out before the Delhi elections in February 2015
 congress or bhaajapa donon maanati hai ki dilli ke matadaataaon ko loktantric matadhikaar kaa puraa phayda milanaa chahie
 Then why is aap's demand for a full state being mocked as a fancy? Desai says that the 'structure' of Delhi's government is designed for peace
 ’ or kai paryvekshak maanate hai ki centre main bhaajapa isi besange dhaanche kaa jis tarah phayda uthaa rahi he, usee ke chalate dilli kii sthiti par nae sire se vichaar karnaa jaruri ho gaya he
 You are proud of your dedication to the city government
 vah daawa karti he ki modi sarkaar kii ajeebogareeb khunnas kii vajah se use apana kaam nahin karne diya ja rahaa
 Marlena says that aap's hands and feet are held in chains of an inane system and cites an article written by Sisodia in support of her point
 ve shiksha niti par unheen kii mukhya salaahkaar thim, jinhen teen saal kaam karne ke baad april main centre sarkaar ne barkhaast kar diya tha, is tarah maano ek chuni hui sarkaar ko khud apane niyukt vyaktirayon ko rakhane kaa haq nahin hona chahie
 Sisodia wrote, "whether it is the incident of peace in Anand Vihar or the rape of a little girl in Shalimar Bagh, the only elected representative of Delhi people who can hold them accountable is the Home Minister of India, whom Along with this, issues of Maoist insurgency are also seen in Jammu and Kashmir, North East and Central India
 ’’kya aap bahut zyada virodh karti he? yah sawaal dilli ke matadaataaon ke liye he
 Though the party is unable to make excuses and be forced to follow its own policies, the only way to make sure that they consider that the state of Delhi except in the NDMC area Be within the scope of the elected government

 He asked Sonia and Rahul to answer how Vadra's business of hundreds of rupees was created with a capital of one lakh
 wadra ke bare main party kii ore se 'damaad shri' naam se jari ek film or pustika main aarope lagaaya gaya ki 'saasuu maa' (sonia) ne apane damaad ko puri chhot de rakhi he or wadra 'farji len-dein' kar rahe hai
 Releasing this booklet at BJP headquarters here, the chief media coordinator of bjp's Lok Sabha elections said that the then Congress-ruled Haryana and Rajasthan governments have helped Vadra build a business empire worth crores of rupees without capital investment
 It is a living example of 'government-promoted capitalism' (crony capitalism)

 prasad ne palatwaar karte hue kaha, gandhi parivaar ke ek sadsy ne naitik bal or bade dil kii baat kahi he

 20 fisadi se bhi kam mahilaon ne kaha ki duty ke baad yaa offis ke kisi program main unhen yon utpeedan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The great thing about this survey is that only 22% of the working victims were able to report sexual harassment to their management

 The Supreme Court says that the lower court should take action in this
 sibiai ne sanvaidhanik peeth ke saamne 2010 main curative petishan daayar kiya tha
 The cbi's appeal was that the 1996 decision by him to accuse the accused of mere negligent death needs to be rectified
 aropiyon par gaiyr−iradatan hatya ke aarope lagane chahie
 In 2010, in the judgment which came 26 years after the accident, all the accused were sentenced to two years each

 The Chief Judicial Magistrate had sentenced the accused to two years, including Union Carbide India President Keshub Mahindra
 peeth ne kaha ki sibiai or madhya pradesh sarkaar is baat kaa koi santoshjanak spashtikaran dene main vifal rahe ki 14 saal ke antaraal ke baad upachaaratmak yachika kyon daayar kii gai

 This is the last election announcement of the term of Chief Election VS Sampath
 iske saath hi dilli kii kadakati sardi menchunavi paara aasmaan chune ke karibahai
 Just like in the election, three parties are in the fray but the competition seems to be happening in BJP and Aam Aadmi Party
 congress baikfoot par dikh rahi he or maidan main mahaj apni upasthiti darj karaati dikh rahi he
 Till now the Aam Aadmi Party was seen accusing the Election Commission that it wanted to postpone the elections in April
 lekin ab tithi kii ghoshnaa hene ke baad uskaa yah aarope apraasangik ho gaya he
 This party, which left the field after forming the government last time, is claiming that it will come to power and will form the government for five whole years
 party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal apane lubhaavne vaadon ke saath maidan main hai
 As usual he has a bundle of charges and stands with all sorts of questions
 duusari ore bijepi he jo modi kii lahar kaa phayda dilli ke chunaav main bhi uthaanaa chaahati he
 But after the pm's rally on Saturday, the party has no choice but to work hard
 modi kii yah raily unki ab tak kii sabase kamjor raily maani ja rahi he
 With this, the party was not able to deliver any kind of message
 iskaa kaaran party alaakaman bhale hi dhundh rahaa ho lekin ek baat tay he ki dilli bijepi ke bade netaaon main talmail kaa abhaav he
 Satish Upadhyay, who became the chairman last year, is still not completely in command
 yahaan ke puraane netaaon ke saath unke sambandhon main abhi vah baat nahin dikh rahi he
 BJP is also contesting in the name of Modi this time and nobody's name is being bumped to the post of Chief Minister whereas surprisingly the Aam Aadmi Party has announced the name of Jagdish Mukhi for BJP CM! Not an issue like other states
 yahaan bijli-pani-sadak kii bhi samasya anya rajyon kii tarah nahin he lekin kanoon vyavastha yahaan bhi badi samasya he
 The situation here is very grim and there is no reduction in crimes
 aam aadmi party ne is mudde ko uthaaya he or bijepi ko pareshaani main daal rakhaa he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP had also talked about making Delhi a full state, this is also an issue of the Aam Aadmi Party on which it is surrounding the BJP
 kul milakar yah chunaav dilachasp hoga or bijepi ke liye mahatvapurn hoga kyonki is nae saal main vah piem modi kii lahar kii takat bhaanpana chaahegi
 Even the Prime Minister of China does not trust the country's GDP figures
 lee kekyang jab uttarpurvi koyala-kshetra praant liyaoning main communist party ke mukhiya the, to ve jidipi data par nahin, balki aankadon ke teen seton par bharosa karte the
 He used to assess the economy of his province from them: consumption of electricity, the amount of goods carried by rail, and loans from banks
 ye ve aankade hai, jinamein sthaneey adhikari aasaani se herpher nahin kar sakate
 Since then, this method is known as "kekyang Index" in China
 yah un arthshaastriyon kii ore se istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he, jo maanate the ki sthaneey sarkaron ne aankadon main herpher kiya he or centre usee aadhaar par jidipi kaa akalan karata rahaa he
 The problem today is not about manipulation of data, but about one or two per cent "manipulations" of GDP for political purposes in a particular year
 beijing main china europe international bijness skool main arthshaastri ju bin kehete hai, “jidipi aankade swabhaav se hi sahi nahin hote hai
 Some researchers argue that as the economy grows at a faster pace, China's GDP goes downwards and upwards when the economy slows down
 ”janvari main china ne elaan kiya tha ki 2015 main usne 6
 Achieved 9 percent growth
 iske jariye sarkaar yah bataanaa chaahati thi ki 7 fisadi vruddhi bhale hi hasil nahin hui ho, par arthvyavastha utani kharaab bhi nahin thi
 How accurate that figure is has been debated
 landan-sthit capital iconomics kii ek report main hisaab lagaaya gaya tha ki 2015 kii pehali do timahiyon main vruddhi ko nishchit rup se ek yaa do fisadi badhaakar pesh kiya gaya tha
 Chang Liu and Mark Williams wrote, "the GDP deflator, which is used to convert unrealistic GDP estimates to real GDP, has flaws in its calculations
 ” unhone hisaab lagaaya ki pehali timahi main vruddhi 5-6 fisadi ke bich thi, na ki 7 fisadi
 His argument was that in order to get a figure of 7 per cent for real GDP, the government must have accounted for the reduction in inflation, while prices were increasing in every other calculation
 honkong uniwarsity of science and technology main arthshaastra ke professor carsten holj ne ek shodhpatr main likhaa, “neshnal beuro of statisticks keemton ke prabhaav main herpher karke vaastavik vruddhi dar main thodaa-bahut upar yaa neeche kar saktaa he
 And in subsequent revisions, when the data for that particular year are carefully removed, it is corrected
 aisa baar-baar nahin kiya ja saktaa he, varanaa data kii jaanch hone par vah ujagar ho jayega
 "government assessors use technical co-ordination to manipulate data according to their calculations
 china ke maamle main yah koi anokhi baat nahin he
 Countries like america-india use different methods for estimating GDP, which have been hotly debated
 china main sarkaar apaardarshita ke saath kaam karti he or usase samasya or bad jaati he
 Just a few days after the 2015 GDP data was announced, China's chief assessor Wang Baoan was mysteriously sacked on 26 January on charges of "serious disciplinary violation", a generally benign term for corruption
 so jab lee kekyang ne kareeb ek dashak pehle kaha tha ki jidipi aankade antat “maanav-nirmit” or “sirf dikhaave” ke liye hote hai to nishchit rup se unki baton main dam tha
 Is China manipulating its GDP data? China says that in 2015 its economy 6
 9 fisadi vruddhi hui, jo nirmaan kshetra main mandi ke baavjood 7 fisadi ke lakshya ke kaaphi kareeb thi
 The government says that the reason for this growth was the services sector, which had grown above 50 per cent for the first time
 kuch arthshaastriyon kaa kahana he ki vaastavik jidipi 2 fisadi tak neeche rahi hogi, kyonki jidipi dicolator ke maamle main aankadon main tod-marod kiya gaya to vaastavik jidipi main vruddhi dikhaai degi
 The general opinion is that 1-2 percent of GDP can be manipulated

 Will prove to be a big break through? This is a big question in itself whether Mohit will get a success path on the big screen through this film
 mohit isse pehle saal 2008 main film don mutthu swami ke jariye bade parde par najar aa chuke hai
 However, the film did not earn much at the box office, nor did Mohit's career get any flight from it

 On Friday's episode of Ishqbaaz, Shivaay dances with Tia to burn Anika

 ) Duda Tora village of Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh was earlier counted as Bigdal village, because the identity of the village was associated with alcohol
 gaanv main sharaab banane kaa kaam bhi bade paimaane par hota tha or adhiktar log sharaab pine ke shaukeen the
 But the picture of this village under the leadership of a woman sarpanch Ram Bai Lodhi has changed
 ab yahaan na to sharaab banati he or na hi koi sharaab peetaa he, kyonki aisa karne vaale ko sajaa jo milane kaa khatra he
 Duda Tora village is located about 35 km from the district headquarters
 is gaanv kii pahchaan sharaab se aisi judi ki yahaan sharaabiyon kaa jamghat laga rahata tha
 The condition had deteriorated so much that even the taste of alcohol was beginning to spread on the tongue of the children
 yah sthiti yahaan kii mahila ke liye sabase zyada kshtdaayak hoti thi, kyonki unhen ghar ke andar evam baahar donon jagah iskaa dushprabhav jhelana padataa tha
 Due to alcoholism, people of other villages were not even ready to have a relationship here
 koi bhi parivaar apni beti kii shaadi duda tora ke yuvak se karnaa pasand nahin karata tha
 But when the command of this village came into the hands of Ram Bai Lodhi, everyone hoped to get rid of this identity, due to which he became the character of Jag Hansi
 iske liye sabhi ne milakar ram bai kii aguwai main panchayat bulaai or sharaab bandi kaa faisla kar daalaa
 Baldev Lodhi of the village says that the decision to ban liquor was taken unanimously in the Panchayat held on March 1, 2012
 itnaa hi nahin ek panchnaama taiyaar kiya gaya ki jo bhi sharaab piega yaa banaata paaya jayega use juuton kii maala pahanaakar gaanv main ghumaya jayega
 Apart from this, he will be fined Rs 10,000
 saath hi uskaa samaaj se bahishkaar kar diya jayega
 Boots are still visible on all four mouths of the village
 iske alaava gaanv ke logon par najar rakhane ke liye nigaraanee samiti bhi banaai gai he
 Ram Bai states that this decision has been taken with the mutual consent of the villagers
 bai hon yaa kalli bai lodhi sabhi sharaab bandi ke baad se kaaphi khush hai
 She says that now there are neither more fights in the village nor do they worry about their children getting spoiled anymore
 itnaa hi nahin unhen is baat kii bhi ummid he ki ab duusare gaanv ke log yahaan rishta jodne se nahin kataraaenge
 Charan Singh Bundela, a journalist from Badagaon Dhasan, a village close to Duda Tora, says that the picture of this village, once a stronghold of liquor, has started changing
 ek mahila sarpanch kii aguwai main gaanv ke logon ne ek saahasik faisla kar varsho se chali aa rahi kuriti ko pal bhar main hi khatm kar diya he
 This is rarely seen
 purv pradhanmantri echdi devgauda kii party janata dal secular ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane astitv ko bachaane kii he
 In the politics of JDS Karnataka, the dream of kingmaker has entered the fray in alliance with the BSP and NCP
 asaduddin auwaisi ne bhi apni party kaa samarthan use de rakhaa he
 The question arises, how far will it be able to bring back its votebank to JDS in 2014? In the politics of Karnataka, Deve Gowda spoke in the 90s
 devgauda ke netritv main janata dal ne 1994 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kii thi
 He was the Chief Minister for two years and in 1996, when the Third Front government was formed, he became the Prime Minister
 iske baad janata dal tutaa to unhone janata dal (secular) naam se apni alag party bana lee
 Presently, JDS is commanded by his son HD Kumaraswamy
 kumaraswami pehle congress ke saath phir bijepi ke saath rajya main sarkaar bana chuke hai
 In 2006, he became the Chief Minister with the support of BJP
 lekin ye saath bahut din tak nahin chal sakaa
 After only one year the BJP withdrew its support when the JDS government fell and the state came under President's rule
 iske baad 2008 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main jedies ko bada jhatka laga, jab bijepi pehali baar karnataka main camel khilaane main safal rahi
 The JDS emerged as a major force from the BJP in the 2013 assembly elections
 yediurppa kaa bijepi se baghawat kaa phayda jedies ko mila magar bahumat se party dur rahi
 Under Siddaramaiah's leadership, the Congress returned to power with an absolute majority
 congress ke baad duusari badi takat ke rup main jedies ne apni jagah banaai
 Of the 224 assembly seats in the state, the JDS had won 40 seats
 2008 ke chunaav kii tulana main ye 12 siten zyada thim
 While BJP also got 40 seats
 haalanki bijepi ko 2008 kii tulana main 72 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 JDS was ahead of BJP in terms of voter share
 jedies ko 20
 Got 2% votes
 to bijepi ko 19
 9 percent
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke ek saal ke baad hi 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav hue to jedies kaa buree tarah se safaya ho gaya
 In the Modi wave, where the Congress managed to save its vote bank, the jds's vote bank shifted to BJP
 bijepi ne 43 fisadi vot share ke saath 17 loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 Congress 40
 80 fisadi vot ke saath 9 sansadeey siten jeet saki
 Whereas JDS got just 11 percent votes and 2 seats
 is tarah vidhansabha chunaav ke lihaaj se dekhen to jedies ko kareeb 9 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 The reach of JDS has significantly reduced among Muslims, backward, Vokaliga and Dalits
 yahi vajah he ki jedies ko karnataka ke kisi ek kshetra main nahin balki sabhi ilaakon main nuksaan uthanaa padaa he
 South Karnataka is considered a strong fort of JDS
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main jedies ko apane kile main bhi kaaphi bada nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 The JDS won around 25 seats in the 2013 assembly elections in the South Karnataka region
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main 15 vidhansabha siton par hi party aage thi
 In this way, the party lagged behind in 10 assembly seats in a year
 jedies ne apane astitv ko bachaane ke liye ensipi or basapa se gathbandhan kiya he
 It has left 20 assembly seats for the BSP and 7 for the NSP
 jabaki asaduddin ovaisi kii party ne bhi unhen karnataka main samarthan de rakhaa he
 The Vokaliga community is believed to be the original votebank of the JDS
 iske alaava rajya main sabase bade votbank dalit samudaay ko saadhane ke liye basapa se use samarthan mila he
 The party is also eyeing 16 per cent Muslims
 gathbandhan hone kii surat main in samudaayon ke voton kaa bantwaaraa hoga, jiskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hoga
 Perhaps this is the reason why Congress President Rahul Gandhi is accusing Deve Gowda of playing a supporting role of BJP
 wo kehete hai-bijepi kii jeet ke liye jedies puure samarpan ke saath juty he
 The Congress is continuously accusing the JDS of acting like the bjp's b team
 
 By sending this message, the Congress wants to get outright votes of Muslims
 congress is muhim main kaamyaab hoti bhi dikh rahi he
 This is the reason why Muslim organizations are viewing the role of JDS with suspicion
 jamaat-e-islamic hind ke mahasachiv saleem ejeeniyar ne kaha ki sampradayik party ko satta main aane se rokna pehla lakshya he
 The role of JDS is under suspicion
 kumaraswami apane pita kii viraasat kii siyasat par daawa karte rahe hai
 He is exerting full power in Old Mysore to become a kingmaker in state politics
 jedies maanakar chal rahi he ki uske haathon main satta kii chaabi hogi
 To fulfill this political aspiration, she is trying hard to win 30 to 40 seats so that she can execute her political plan

 The news of death also came on 11 June 2017, however, this is not the first time the news of Baghdadi's death has come

 Syrian State Television confirmed this
 magar bagdadi kii maut kii aisi pushtiyaan kai baar ho chuki thim
 So no one believed it
 phir iraq or syria kii sarkaron kii taraf se bhi pushti hui
 But the world had to believe when Russia said that Baghdadi was killed in its attack
 22 agast 2018 saamne ai jaani pahachaani aawajiske baad bagdadi kii koi khayr khabar nahin ai to duniya ne maan liya ki sachmuch mar gaya bagdadi or iesas kii kahani khatm ho gai
 But once again suddenly a familiar voice came
 is aawaaj ko bagdadi kii awaz bataaya gaya
 Which called for a message to reunite the scattered ISIS
 "sab ekajute rahen"is audio main kaha gaya, "aap sab ekajute rahen or himmat nahin haaren kyonki allaah hamaara imtihaan le rahaa he
 Our supporters are being tested with fear and hunger, but the good news will be given only to those who will face it with patience
 allaah kii rahamat se khalipha bana rahegaa
 "the world was revealed in 2014 to baghdadiabu Bakr al-baghdadi has been hidden for the last five years
 duniya ko bagdadi kaa pataa sabase pehle july 2014 main tab chalaa tha, jab uskaa mosul kii masjid kaa ek video saamne aayaa tha
 There have been claims of Baghdadi's death several times after this
 farvari 2018 main america ke adhikariyon ne bataaya tha ki may 2017 main hue hawaii hamale main bagdadi jakhmi ho gaya he
 Since then, there has been no trace of ISIS leader Baghdadi
 oktober 2017 main tabadatod hawaii hamalon main uske hajaaron ladaake to maar giraae gaye the
 But the US did not confirm Baghdadi's death
 lekin ab khud america sena ke adhikari kaa kahana he ki most wanted aatankwaadi abu bakar al-bagdadi syria main america sainikon ke vishesh oparation main nishaanaa bana he

 unhone kaha ki vah media kii kadra karte hai or kabhi−kabhi aisa ho jaataa he

 apni jindadilii or safagoi se ve kisi bhi mehfil main kii shaan ban jaati hai
 Few people will know that the more proficient they are in Asha Tai singing, the more proficient they are in cooking
 saarvajanik jivan main aashaa bhosle ko kabhi naaraaz hote nahin dekha gaya, lekin varsh 2007 main navdith gayak-sangeetkaar or abhinayta himesh reshmia ne ek aisi tippanee kar di thi ki unhen behad gussa aa gaya tha
 In fact, Himesh Reshammiya had described Asha's husband and famous musician (late) RD Varman as a nose-singing singer

 Himesh said this while commenting about his singing

 He even threatened Himesh to get a slap
 aashaaji kii is naaraazgi ke baad himesh ko apni galati kaa ahsaas hua or unhone apane is bayaan par safai dete hue maafee bhi maangi
 Ashaji, the giant heart, also forgave Himesh's mistake, forgiving him

 Himesh Reshammiya said about the 'RD' that gives songs like mehbooba-mehbooba (film Sholay), Yama Yama, Woh Sundar Saman (film Shan), that high pitch songs bring a touch of nasal voice and such fame
 The composer was also with Singer RD Burman
 himesh ne apni gayaki ke bare main tippanee karte hue yah baat kahi thi
 This comment of Himesh went unnoticed to Asha
 unhone himesh ko thappad raseed karne kii dhamkee tak de daali thi
 After this resentment of Ashaji, Himesh realized his mistake and apologized while clarifying his statement
 vishaal hriday aashaaji ne bhi himesh kii is galati ko bhulaate hue unhen maaf kar diya
 Later she also appeared as a judge on a music show with Himesh Reshammiya

 bharat or china ne ladakh main takreeban 20 dinon tak bani rahi takaraav kii sthiti khatm hone kii ghoshnaa bhale hi kar di ho, par halaat puri tarah patari par nahin aae hai
 Recently, the Chinese Army stopped a patrol of the Indian Army from reaching the Line of Actual Control
 yah ghatana 17 may ko us vakt hui, jab iske do hi din baad china ke pradhanmantri lee quing dilli pahunchane vaale the
 The incident of the Indian patrol being stopped happened near the 'finger-8' area known as Siri Zap
 chini pradhanmantri ke daure se pehle elaan kiya gaya tha ki bhartiya seemaa main 19 kilometre bheetar tak hui chini sena kii ghuspaith se paidaa hui takaraav kii sthiti khatm ho gai he
 It was claimed that the intruding Chinese soldiers had moved back to their former positions
 udhampur ke thalsena pravaktaa ne to is ghatana par koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 But government sources said that there was some skirmish in the Finger-8 area, after which the army patrol returned without moving towards LAC
 sutron ne kaha ki is ghatana ke baad ladakh main tainaat 14 kor ne sabhi gasht roak di
 The patrols sent to Dipsang were also stopped
 dipasang main hi chini sena ne kareeb teen hafte tak apane tambu laga rakhe the
 Sources said that China has managed to build roads up to the 'finger-4' area
 ‘finger-4’ ilaaka bhi siri jap ilaake ke daayre main aata he or yah bhartiya seemaa main elesi se paanch kilometre bheetar he
 The Chinese claim in their maps that this area falls within their territory, while the Indian Army claims that it is part of Ladakh
 is ilaake ke babat aksar 1962 ke yuddh kaa hawala diya jaataa he jab bharat or china kii sena ne is ilaake main ghamaasan ladaai ladi thi
 Major Dhan Singh Thapa was awarded Paramvir Chakra to take on the Chinese Army (PLA) in this area
 baharhaal, sutron ne kaha ki aise samay main jab vaarta kii mej par bharat apane paksh ko sahi tehraane kii koshish kar rahaa he, chini sena ne sadak bana kar daawa kiya he ki yah ilaaka aksai chin kaa hissaa he
 He said that many times the Indian Army has used this road for patrolling and has been claiming its claim
 mana ja rahaa he ki beete 15 april ko sudur daulat beg oldy sector main chini ghuspaith is vajah se hui kyonki chumaar divijan main ek nigaraanee tower kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 According to the details of the flag meetings held in the last week of March this year, the Chinese side objected to the construction of the surveillance tower at Chumar Division near LAC
 chumaar divijan yahaan se kareeb 300 kilometre kii duuri par he
 Sources said Indian security forces stopped patrolling in certain areas such as Rocky Knob after announcing the end of the confrontation
 ladakh-himachal pradesh seemaa par sthit ek sudur gaanv chumaar china ke liye ek bada mudda rahaa he or vah daawa karata rahaa he ki yah ilaaka uskaa hissaa he
 China intrudes into this area more or less every year by helicopter
 pichley saal to is kshetra main china ne piele ke kuch javaanon ko yahaan tainaat kar diya tha or thalsena tathaa itibipi ke asthaayee storage tambu hataa die the
 This area cannot be monitored by the border of China, but India has built a road till the last point which can bear a load of up to nine tonnes
 vibhinn bhartiya raksha balon main samanvay kii thodi kami najar aa rahi he
 The ITBP has complained to the Union Home Ministry that it was excluded from the flat meeting with China on 5 May
 5 may ko hui flag meeting main hi donon deshon ne apni-apni sena peeche hataane kaa faisla kiya tha
 China has again made a well-planned diplomatic move
 maanchitron main bharat kii sarahadein choti karne par tula he china
 Once again, China has expressed that the areas of India which are under stress from neighboring countries do not consider it a part of India
 taaja maamla kashmir se judaa he
 China has now started calling it a separate country
 kashmir ko ek alag desh batayakathmandu se aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik tibet aae paryatakon or patrakaron ko ek nakshaa baanta ja rahaa he, jisamen kashmir ko ek alag desh bataaya gaya he
 In the media kit being distributed in Tibet, along with maps made by China, some information about Tibet is also being given
 china ne is media kit main jo itihaas likhaa he uske mutabik 1950 main hi china ne tibet par hamalaa kar use apane kabje main le liya tha
 The borders of 4 countries connected with Tibet, it is also written that the borders of Tibet are connected to four countries and those four countries are India, Nepal, Myanmar and Kashmir
 yani china ke banaae is map ke mutabik, kashmir ek alag desh he
 On the other hand, China is providing financial assistance to Pakistan for making dams in Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 yani us ilaake par pakistan ke kabje ko wo vaid tehra rahaa he
 It is clear that this double attitude of China can increase India's headache

 'we did not insult the PM, but his party vice-president said on the recent allegations of the Prime Minister that the vice president of your party disrespected the government, the cabinet
 hamane aapke faislon ko media ke saamne nahin phada
 Referring to the anger expressed when the Prime Minister called himself a thief in Parliament, Modi said, where is your political courtesy now, which is being said to the main opposition of this country inappropriate things in the public meeting inside the elections

 Diesel and petrol prices in Delhi are also seeing a steady increase due to the continuing increase in the prices of crude oil in the international market
 beete saal june main jahaan brent crude ke nunatam str 44 dollar prati bairal se badhkar maujuuda samay main lagbhag 70 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gaya he
 The continuous rise in crude oil prices in the global market during the last few months has also increased the risk of unbridled inflation in Asian and especially India
 bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki antarrashtriya str par keemton main ijaphe kaa sidhaa asar bade ayatak deshon kii arthvyavastha par padataa he
 At the same time, the growth in the international market from June 2017 to November 2017 is more than 30 per cent, so obviously it has started to affect the economy
 gauratlab he ki in 6 maheenon main crude oil kii keemton main oochaal kii tulana june 2014 se janvari 2015 se kii ja sakati he, jahaan keemten 115 dollar prati bairal ke ucchtam str se ludhakkar 45 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai thi
 Recently the research group Nomura claimed that if the situation in the Gulf countries continues to deteriorate, then India like India may have to bear the brunt of rising crude oil prices
 gauratlab he ki bharat main kachche tel kii kul khapat kaa 80 fisadi khadi deshon se niryaat kiya jaataa he
 Hence, the direct impact of rising prices is going to have a bearing on retail inflation, growth rate and GDP in the country
 global market main crude oil ke liye saal 2012 se 2017 tak kaa safar desh kii raajnneeti ke liye game changer sabit ho chukaa he
 Global crude oil prices increased the challenges of the previous Congress government so much that in 2014 the government had to face defeat in the elections on the issue of inflation
 vahiin 2014 main chunaav ke nattejey aate hi kendra main bani nai bijepi sarkaar ke liye global crude oil kii keemten vardaan sabit huin
 Amidst this ups and downs, while the price of crude oil fell from $ 125 per barrel to $ 30 per barrel in the global market, the price of petrol in the country went from Rs 76 to Rs 56 per liter
 ab ek baar phir global market main crude kii keemton main sudhaar hona shuru ho chukaa he
 Modi government got boon of cheap petrol During the tenure of Manmohan Singh government in 2012, crude oil reached $ 125 per barrel in the international market and remained constant at $ 100 per barrel till the 2014 general elections
 april 2014 main chunaav hue or crude kii keemton main phislan kii bhi shuruyaat hui
 This slippery, which began in May 2014, soon after the election results brought down the price of crude from $ 100 a barrel to $ 50 a barrel by December 2015
 yah phislan yaheen nahin khatm hoti
 By January 2016, crude oil prices fell to their all-time low of $ 30 a barrel
 gauratlab he ki kachche tel kii keemten kendra sarkaar ke khajaane se kharch kaa sabase bada or sabase ahm kharch he
 Here, every penny left is used for the government to pursue its economic and social policies
 ise padhein: aarthik surveykshan: GDP ko notebandi, crude oil kii keemton se sabase bada khatrapahele se kitna badal chuke hai halaat?desh main petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit karne kaa niyam badal chukaa he
 Where previously, the price of petrol was determined every two months by adding tax along with estimation of import cost per month
 iske baad is formule par petrol kii keemat prati maah or phir prati saptaah nirdhaarit kii jane lagi
 But for the past few months, the price of petrol per day is determined by the fluctuations of crude oil in the global market and the assessment of tax in the country
 lihaaja in teen saal ke dauraan crude kii keemton main baari pherbadal se petrol kii keemat main bhi utaar-chadhaav kaa silsilaa bana rahaa he
 In 2014, the common man's first slippage of crude slippage began in 2015
 jahaan crude 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gaya tha vahiin dilli main prati litre petrol kii keemat pehali baar 60 rupee prati litre ke neeche gai
 However, the price of petrol ranged from Rs 66 to Rs 60 per liter throughout the year
 2016 main oktober tak saste petrol kaa khel khatm ho gaya or yahaan se ek baar phir petrol kii keemton main badhottaree shuru ho gai
 During this time, the price of one liter of petrol rose from Rs 66 to Rs 70 and during 2017, petrol price again went up from Rs 70 per liter to Rs 63 per liter

 When the price of crude reached $ 150, the global organization Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicted that in the current global economic situation, the price of crude oil could go up to $ 270 per barrel by 2020
 gauratlab he ki 2008 main crude oil abtak ke sarvaadhik str 145 dollar prati bairal par thi
 At the same time, the price of crude oil reached $ 30 per barrel due to ongoing dispute in Gulf countries during 2015 and 2016 and lack of demand in developing countries including China
 oisidi kii yah bhavishyavaanee kaa aadhaar he ki aane vaale varshon main china or bharat jaisi arthvyavasthaaen raftaar pakadaney ke liye indhan ke maang main bada ijapha kar sakati he
 Read this: Know what the impact of Budget 2018's speech will have on the stock market! Petrol will be 100 rupees a liter even without $ 100 crude? In order to cross the 100 rupees price of petrol in India, crude oil does not necessarily touch this level
 beete teen saal tak desh main crude kii keemat or kendra or rajya sarkaron dwaara liya ja rahaa tex petrol kii keemat ko usee samay 100 rupee tak pahunchaa saktaa he jab ek baar phir crude oil 2014 ke str yani 100 dollar prati bairal ko chhu le
 It is noteworthy that GST was implemented in the country in July 2017 but the prices of petrol and diesel were kept out of the GST ambit
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki petrol-dijal par rajyon dwaara lagaaya ja rahaa tex unke vaarshik revenue kaa bada hissaa he
 After it is brought under GST, it will start selling at a price by levying central tax on petrol and diesel across the country

 duniya main tisare dhruv ke taur par jane jane vaale himalay par global varming kaa jabardast prabhaav pad rahaa he
 According to a recent study on the Hindukush Himalayas, 2 in temperature despite taking steps to limit global warming to one and a half degrees Celsius under the Paris Agreement
 1 degree celsius kii badhotaree shatabdi ke ant tak hogi
 This will affect the glacier of the Himalayas
 agar aisa hua to is ilaake ke ek tihaai glacier pigal jaaenge or himalay main rahane vaale 25 karod pahari log or isi ke saath 165 karod aise log jo himalay ke aasapaas rahete hai, un par bura asar padegaa
 According to the study, if the current steps to control climate change are unsuccessful, according to the emission of this time, by 2100, two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers will melt
 isaki vajah se nadiyon main pani teji se ghat jayega or isse himalay ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main pani kaa sankat khadaa ho jayega
 Phillips Wester of the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development says that it will be a climate tragedy you never heard of
 unke mutabik global varming kaa maujuuda trend is tareeke kaa he ki isse hindukush himalay kii tamaam chotiyaan barfvihin ho jaaengi
 Due to global warming, the level of air pollution in all the countries around the Himalayas will become more dangerous
 mausam kii gatividhiyaan bhi bhayanak ho jaaengi
 Floods at some places and droughts at some places and tremendous storms at some places
 unhone bataaya ki taaja adhyayan ke mutabik monsoon se pehle nadiyon ke bahaav main kaaphi kami aa jaaegi
 a change in the monsoon pattern can also be seen
 isaki vajah se shaharon main pani kii supplai prabhavit hogi or khaane pine kii killat bad sakati he
 What to say Professor Syed Masood Ahmed, Senior Scientist at the Senior Scientific Geophysical Research Institute, said that the latest report of the IPCC has said that it will not be easy to stop global warming
 vayumandal main maanviya gatividhiyon kii vajah se greenhouse gaisen lagaataar bad rahi he
 Professor Syed Masood Ahmad these days, at Jamia Millia Islamia University in the capital Delhi, students are getting exposed to the dangers of global warming
 unka kahana he ki paris samjhaute ko aksharshah lagu karne ke baavjood 1
 5 degree Celsius will be increased only by 2030
 america or china jaise bade audyogic desh jab tak global varming ko rokane kii jimmedaari se bachate rahenge, tab tak yah samasya bani rahegi
 The rising temperature of the atmosphere and the impact of greenhouse gases will certainly make the Himalayan glaciers melt faster
 in deshon par padegaa asarhindukush himalay ilaaka 3500 kilometre tak failaa hua he
 These mountains are spread across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan
 himalay ke oonche oonche glacier se duniya kii sabase mahatvapurn 10 nadiyaan nikalati hai
 These rivers have large rivers like Ganga, Indus, Yellow River, Iravati Mekong, Brahmaputra, Sutlej, Vyas, Ravi
 inamen himalay ke glacier se aa rahaa pani puure saal bahata rahata he
 If the Himalayan glaciers dry up, these rivers will have no water for 12 months

 The glaciers of the Himalayan Mountains are very sensitive to the changing weather
 1970 se is ilaake main maujuud glacier par global varming ke asar ko lagaataar record kiya ja rahaa he
 All the major glaciers in the Himalayas are continuously melting rapidly
 dhire dhire kai aise ilaake jahaan par hameshaa barf rahati thi, vahaan se barf puri tarah se hatni shuru ho gai he
 The impact of these changes in the environment of the Himalayas is beginning to be seen
 ilaake main 25 karod pahari log rahete hai
 Out of these, one-third people earn just 1 per day
 9 dollar he
 There are 30 percent people living in this area who do not have enough food to eat
 50 fisadi log aise hai jo kisi naa kisi tarah ke kuposhan se prabhavit hai
 In such a situation, global warming will affect people in this area badly
 is adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki hindukush himalay main 500 giga wat bijli paidaa karne kaa samarthy he
 With this, electricity can be supplied to the homes of one billion people
 lekin is ilaake main rahane vaale zyaadaatar log paaramparik eendhan kaa istemaal karte hai jisase global varming ko badhaava miltaa he, lihaaja is taraf dhyaan die jane kii jarurat he
 Scientist Dr Shakeel Ahmad, who works on Nadiangaround water, said that global warming is definitely affecting the Himalayas
 jamiya milia islamia vishvavidhyalay main jeography department main padhaa rahe doctor shakeel ahamed ne bataaya ki aane vaale dinon main himalay main jaise-jaise glacier teji se pighalane shuru honge vaise vaise shuruyaat main nadiyon main pani kaa str bad jayega or isaki vajah se baadh kaa bhi khatra ho saktaa he
 But when the glaciers melt completely, the rivers will not have water for 12 months
 lekin isse nipatane ke liye tamaam takneekee pragati bhi samay ke saath saath hoti rahegi lihaaja global varming ko lekar log apane ko samay ke anuroop bhi dhalate rahenge
 But the impact of global warming will definitely affect people

 (with agency input) maujuuda fifa world cap main mexico kii germany par jeet ke baad prashansakon ke jashn se ‘kritrim bukamp’ aane kaa ek twit viral hua tha, lekin visheshgyon ke mutabik koi bukamp nahin aayaa tha
 In this match played on Sunday, Mexico defeated the defending champions Germany 1-0
 mexico kii ek sanstha esammse (bhugolic or vayumandaleey anusandhan santhaan) ne match ke samay twit kiya tha, ‘mexico city main kritrim bukamp kaa pataa chalaa he
 This probably happened at 11:32 pm after a jump during a World Cup match
 ’mexico ke prashansakon dwaara jashn ke kaaran aae ‘ bukamp ’ kii khabar ko duniyabar kii media ne prakashit kiya tha
 The National Seismic Service (SSN), an earthquake-tracking public body in Mexico, did not, however, announce any earthquake in Mexico City on Sunday
 FIFA WC: rus ne misr ko haraakar antim-16 main pravesh kii ore rakhaa kadamesaysan ke sadsy or neshnal autonomas uniwarsity main bhu -bhautikee santhaan kii jayoli ramirage kampos ne kaha ki badi sankhya main logon ke ek saath kudane se kampan ho saktaa he , lekin yah bukamp ke tarangon se mail nahin khaataa

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin graph par yah kampan ke taur par dikhataa he, bukamp ke taur par nahin
 'he said,' It is not true that there was an earthquake from Mexico's Gol

 He said of the SIMMSA organization tweeting the news of the earthquake, "no one knows about this site in the earthquake-related community
 ’ Will the voting patterns of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha separately feed the BJP or will the history be repeated? The political equations of Jharkhand assembly elections are being set
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey kii paimaaish vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kii jaae to sattadhari dal kaa palada philhal baari dikhataa he
 In view of this, the BJP is carrying a target of Mission 65 Plus
 lekin, jharkhand ke voting pattern ko dekhen to loksabhaa chunaav main behatar karne vaali party vidhansabha chunaav main pradarshan acha nahin kar paati he
 In such a situation, if the same voting pattern is there, it may be difficult for Raghuvar Das in the assembly elections? In the Lok Sabha elections, the bjp-led NDA coalition won 12 of the 14 seats in Jharkhand
 in nateezon ko vidhansabha siton ke lihaaj se akalan karne par pataa chalata he ki kul 81 vidhansabha kshetron main endie gathbandhan 63 siton (57 bijepi or 6 ajasu) par badhat thi
 Whereas the opposition, which won two seats in the Lok Sabha, had gained only 18 assembly seats
 bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke isi trend ko aadhaar banaakar vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye 65 siton kaa lakshya tay karte hue 'abaki baar 65 paar' kaa naaraa bhi diya he
 However, history is witness that the results of Jharkhand assembly elections have always been different from the results of Lok Sabha elections
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki loksabhaa ke chunavi mudde vidhansabha chunaav main apana prabhaav nahin dikhaa pate hai
 The first Lok Sabha election after the formation of Jharkhand was held in 2004
 is chunaav main pradesh kii kul 14 siton main se congress-6, jeemem-5,bijepi-1 argedy-1 or sipiai-1 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 But after a year when the 2005 assembly was held, the Congress and the JMM became completely clean
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ko dekhen to bijepi-30, jediu-6, jeemem-17, congress-9, argedy-7 or anya partiyaan12 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, in Jharkhand, BJP-7, JMM-2, JVM-2, Congress-1 and Independents managed to win 2 seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi apana varchasv barkaraar nahin rakh saki
 Congress-14, JVM-11, BJP-18, JMM-18 and other parties got 10 seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi bijepi ko rajya main 14 main se 12 siten hasil hui thim
 It got more than forty percent of the votes, but in the assembly elections held about six months later, BJP could win only 37 assembly seats on its own
 yah baat digar he ki baad main jhavimo se tuutakar chah vidhayak bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the , jisase uskaa aankada 43 pahunch gaya tha
 In just six months, there was a huge reshuffle in the figures
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaavon main endie ko 12 siten mili hai
 The difference is that in 2014 the BJP alone won 12 seats, whereas this time the NDA alliance has won the same number of seats
 bijepi-ajasu kii jodi vidhansabha chunaavon main is baar kya loksabhaa ke chunaav parinaam doharaa paaegi, sabaki nigahen isi par lagi hui hai
 It is to be seen whether Chief Minister Raghuvar Das is able to write new history or not

 kahani kaa ek vah ahm hissaa, jisase hamen seekhney mila ki abhinayta ko apni bhoomika ke liye screen par kai padaarthon ko soonghnaa tha
 For this the actor had to resort to milk powder for all the scenes which he was seen sniffing every time
 tanuj din main kam se kam 15-20 baar doodh ke powder ko suungha karte the
 The actor learned from watching movies how the substance is intoxicated

 iske liye abhinayta ko sabhi drishyon ke liye doodh powder kaa sahaara lenaa padaa jise vah har baar soonghtey hue nazar aae
 Tanuj used to smell milk powder at least 15-20 times a day

 In between shots, it would become an entertaining scene that would make everyone laugh

 english premier lig kii team west ham united ke liye khel kar itihaas banane vaali indian golkeeper aditi chouhan aaj khelon kii duniya main acha naam kama chuki hai
 But would you believe that Aditi had never dreamed of becoming a footballer
 karate or wollyboul khelti thinji haa ye sach he aditi ne kabhi footballar banane kaa sapana nahin dekha tha
 Although Aditi started participating in sports from a very young age, but she did not play football
 basketbaal or karate kii acchhee player aditi karate main blike belt dharak hone ke saath hi skool level kii basketbaal team main bhi ahm sadsy thi
 But once he started playing football, everyone left behind
 shuru main hui thi dikkatenshuruyaat main to jab aditi ne footbal main kariyar banane kii sochi to gharavaalon, khaastaur se papa kaa yahi maananaa tha ki aditi ko footbal nahin khelnaa chahie
 Because Aditi's father Abhaveer Chauhan, who was a good tennis player and Aditi's nanny who was a national record breaker shot putter at university level, knew that there is not a very good future in sports here , especially in team games
 golkiping coach nahin milakhayr papa to maan gaye lekin ab samasya thi golkiping coach kii
 It was almost impossible to get a goalkeeping coach in our country 8-9 years ago
 aditi ke papa ke mutabik, 'jab isane kaha ki ye footballar bananaa chaahati he to hamen laga ki vakt barbaad kar rahi he koi future nahin he
 Anyway, the biggest problem with all the problems in this was that no goalkeeping coach was available here
 hamane kaaphi koshishen kii lekin golkiping kaa speshlise coach nahin mila
 Then we thought that when we start training, it will be managed gradually and thinking that we started coming from Dwarka to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for practice
 'koun le jaae roj stadiumyaha se shuru hui aditi kii footbal jarney, jarney ke shuru hote hi ek badi dikkat saamne aa gai
 And it was a problem that Aditi's SPG officer Papa was in pm's security and was a mummy teacher, due to which Aditi had a lot of difficulty in bringing her daily for practice
 ek baar ko to laga ki aditi kii footbal yatra ab tham jaaegi lekin tabhi uski nani jo ki ek bade enjio kii muradabad shakha kii founder chairman hai
 She came forward and for Aditi, she came to Delhi and took the responsibility of transporting her for daily training
 mila kadi mehnat kaa faljald hi aditi or uski family ko mehnat ke nattejey bhi dikhne lage or aditi ne pehle dilli under-19 or phir india under-19 vimens tiimon ke liye khilne ke baad indian neshnal footbal team main apni jagah banaai
 The biggest turning point in Aditi's career came when she enrolled for a diploma in sports management at Lonzburg University in England
 longeberg main padhane ke saath hi aditi uniwarsity kii footbal team ke liye bhi khilne lageen or vahaan se aditi ko mauka mila west ham united kii ladies team ke liye khilne kaa
 Today, even though Aditi has achieved a position in Indian football that no one has done till date, Aditi had never thought of becoming a footballer and neither had dreamed of achieving all that much
 kabhi nahin laga ki footballar bananaa haaaditi kahati hai, 'mujhe kabhi nahin laga ki mujhe footballar hi bananaa he
 When i first played football, i studied in class 9
 pehali baar footbal khilne ke baad ye game mujhe itnaa pasand aayaa ki main khelti gai
 Then when i was 15 years old, i played for the Delhi State Under-19 team for the first time
 phir do saal baad main indian under-19 team ke liye select ho gai or phir indian neshnal team ke liye khilne lagi
 Aditi, who came to study UK, further says, "when i came to UK for further studies, i had to study only
 i did not come here thinking that i have to play in the Premier League
" main to ghar se yahi sochakar nikali thi ki uniwarsity kii footbal team main sellection ho jaae
 So that my practice continues with the new experience
 vahaan meraa game dekhakar logon ne mujhase klbon ke liye trial dene kii baat kahi
 i thought what is the problem with this
 phir main weekends par kabhi trial vagairah de detii thi
 After one such trial, my selection was done here
 maine kabhi itnaa sab hasil karne kaa sapana to nahin dekha lekin haa maine mehnat bahut kii he
 And being completely positive, i have given my 100 percent to the game

 BJP President Nitin Gadkari has said that he discussed the issue of NDA (national Democratic Alliance) candidate for the post of Prime Minister with coalition partner and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and assured him that no decision in the name of Narendra Modi yet has been taken
 gadakari ne 'enditivi' ko die sakshatkaar main kaha, maine unase (nitish kumaar se) yah kaha he ki hamane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar par koi faisla nahin kiya he
 i told him that he is a part of the NDA and when we decide the candidate's name, we will discuss it with him as well
 tab tak is mudde par charchaa karnaa apraasangik he
 He said these things in response to a question about the opposition of Nitish Kumar in the name of Modi as the NDA candidate for the Prime Minister's post
 gadakari ne kaha, agar unki or hamaari vichaardhaara ek hoti, to hamaari ek hi party nahin hoti kya? unhen asahmat hone kaa adhikaar he
 Asked about Team Anna's hunger strike and the decision to form a political party, he said, "anna Hazare cannot be our option
" ek rajnatik paati kaa vikalp duusari rajnatik party hoti he
 The alternative to Congress is BJP
 gadakari ne is baat ke bhi sanket die ki nitish kumaar or unki party jediu ke congress kaa saath dene kii sambhaavna nahin he
 He said that the Chief Minister of Bihar is a disciple of Ram Manohar Lohia, who was a staunch critic of the Congress
 iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaha ki team anna ko party banane kaa adhikaar he, lekin saath hi yah bhi kaha ki anna ek rajaneta nahin hai
 The comments unhone kaha ki bijepi ne pichhali baar team anna ko samarthan diya tha, lekin is baar nahin diya, kyonki unhone party se sahyog nahin maanga
 The BJP president said, if someone is demonstrating against corruption, be it Anna Hazare or Baba Ramdev, it is our natural tendency to support him
 pichley saal, unhone hamaara samarthan maanga or hamane diya
 This year he did not ask for our support
 haal ke raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main bijepi kaa rukh spasht karne main hui deree ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki party ke kai sadasyon kaa yah mat tha ki pranab mukherjee ke kad ke kaaran unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya janaa chahie
 He also said that former President APJ Abdul Kalam was keen to contest the election despite clarifying from the BJP that he would not get the requisite support
 gadakari ne kaha ki kalam baad main peeche hate
 In an interview to NDTV, Gadkari said, i have told him (to Nitish Kumar) that we have not taken any decision on the prime ministerial candidate
 maine unase kaha ki vah rajg kaa ek hissaa hai or jab ham ummidavaar ke naam kaa faisla karenge, to unke saath bhi charchaa karenge
 Until then it is irrelevant to discuss the issue
 unhone pradhanmantri pad ke rajg ummidavaar ke taur par modi ke naam par nitish kumaar ke virodh ke bare main puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main ye baaten kahin
 Gadkari said, if he and our ideology were one, would we not have a single party? They have the right to disagree
 team anna ke anshan or rajnatik party banane ke faisle ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, anna hajaare hamaara vikalp nahin ho sakate
 The alternative to one political party is another political party
 congress kaa vikalp bijepi he
 Gadkari also indicated that Nitish Kumar and his party JDU are unlikely to support the Congress
 unhone kaha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ram manohar lohia ke shishy hai, jo congress ke kattar aalochak the
 Apart from this, he also said that Team Anna has the right to form a party, but also said that Anna is not a politician
 tippaniyan He said that BJP had supported Team Anna last time, but did not give this time because they did not seek support from the party
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, agar koi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahaa he, jaahe vah anna hajaare hon yaa baba ramdev, use samarthan dena hamaari swaabhaavik pravriti he
 Last year, they asked for and supported us
 is saal unhone hamase samarthan nahin maanga
 Asked about the delay in clarifying bjp's stance in the recent presidential election, he said that many members of the party were of the opinion that his candidature should be supported due to the stature of Pranab Mukherjee
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki bijepi kii ore se yah spasht kiye jane ke baavjood ki unhen apekshit samarthan nahin milegaa, purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam chunaav ladane ke icchhuk the
 Gadkari said that Kalam later retreated
 gadakari ne kaha, agar unki or hamaari vichaardhaara ek hoti, to hamaari ek hi party nahin hoti kya? unhen asahmat hone kaa adhikaar he
 Asked about Team Anna's hunger strike and the decision to form a political party, he said, "anna Hazare cannot be our option

 But very few people know that this movement started from 8 August 1942
 darasal, 8 agast 1942 ko bombai ke gowalia tanks maidan par akhil bhartiya congress mahasmiti ne vah prastaav paarit kiya tha, jise 'bharat chodo' prastaav kaha gaya
 Since then, this movement was started on a wide scale

 Akodara is the first digital village of the country, there never happens to be a historical speech of Cash Crunch Gandhi, Gandhiji gave a speech from Gowalia Tank Ground
 unhone kaha, 'main aapako ek mantra dena chahta hum jise aap apane dil main utaar len, yah mantra he, karo yaa maro'
 Later this Gowalia Tank Ground became known as August Kranti Maidan

 The British rule was so afraid that it spared not a single leader

 Pew Research said in its survey report, "despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to put a high-value banknote out of circulation in November last year, less than half of the Indian population considers lack of cash availability a major problem

 samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia ne kabhi kaha tha ki kamjor hone ke baad congress samaajwaadiyon kii sabase acchhee sahyogi party sabit hogi
 Electoral strategist Prashant Kishor must have had a similar hope while holding a cycle in the hands of the Congress
 lekin votaron ke dil main kuch or tha or kishor ko apane kariyar kii pehali badi haar kaa swaad chakhnaa padaa he is jeet ke saath amit shah ne bihar main mili haar kaa hisaab bhi chuktaa kiya he
 It was perhaps the first time in UP that a veteran leader of the Congress campaigned under the command of a regional leader
 lekin prashanth kishor kaa ye daanv kaam nahin aayaa
 The Congress was already in a dying state in UP
 prashanth kishor kii team ne '27 saal, upi behaal' ke naare ke saath rahul gandhi kii khaat yatra nikaalkar jor-shor se party ke prachaar abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya tha
 But as soon as the journey was over, it was clear that the Congress could not do any political miracle on its own
 nateezon se saaf he ki prachaar ke bichon-bich apane hi slogan ke khilaaf akhilesh yadav kaa daaman thaamna votaron ko raas nahin aayaa
 Exclusive Election Result TV: Live with Anjana Om Kashyap How not to win when the leadership does not? Whether the 2014 general election or the Bihar assembly election or the Punjab assembly election results, Prashant Kishore's magic only came when there was a strong face in the field
 upi main pehle-pahal prashanth kishor ne shila dikshit ko siem ummidavaar banwaaya
 His intention was to win the heart of Congress's traditional forward caste vote bank through Dixit
 jab ye saaf hua ki shila dikshit votaron par asar daalane main naakaam rahi hai to kishor or unki team ne priyanka gandhi ko prachaar kii kaman dene kii har mumkin koshish kii
 But Priyanka did not accept this role and Congress could not find any face for her campaign
 party kii naiya dubone main rahi-sahi kasar sthaneey netaaon ne puri kii jo prashanth kishor kii sunne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Amit Shah's revenge: Both Prashant Kishore and Amit Shah are considered to be Chanakya of electoral strategy, but differences between the two have been going on since the 2014 elections
 kaha jaataa he ki amit shah ko in chunaavon main modi ke saath kishor kii najdiki gavaara nahin thi
 There was a time when Prashant Kishore used to camp at Modi's residence in Gujarat and Modi did not forget to take his opinion before taking any major political decision
 isi ranjish kaa nateeja tha ki modi ke dilli kii satta par kabiz hone ke baad prashanth kishor ne achaanak jediu kaa saath dene kaa faisla kiya
 Prashant Kishore is said to have wanted a bigger role in the party after Modi's victory, but Amit Shah did not allow this to happen

 Businessmen trading less than two crore rupees are very happy because of the two percent tax exemption on e-transactions of the central government
 jaipur kii mashhoor jaipuri razaiyon or sanganeri kapadon ke vyapaariyon ne kaha ki jis tarah ke halaat hai usamen sarkaar kaa yah faisla behad raahat denevaala he
 The reason for the happiness of the traders is that since demonetisation, up to 90 percent of the trade has been done by cash transactions, so saving two percent is going to give relief
 kuch vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki isse do number ke paise kaa system khatm hoga
 In business, the number two is called the black money on which the merchant does not pay tax
 vyapaaree hariom lashkari kaa kahana he ki notebandi kii vajah se hamaare vyapaar par asar to padaa he lekin dhire-dhire waapas se vyapaar patari par bhi aa rahaa he
 Although the trade was completely closed in November, it has increased in December
 unka maananaa he ki nai vyavastha se vyapaariyon ko long-turm main laabh hoga
 There are about 3000 Jaipurpuri quilt workers who have a turnover of less than 2 crores
 inamen se aadhe kabhi koi tex nahin dete the
 But due to scarcity of cash, everyone has started trading with the card
 aise main sab tex ke daayre main aa gaye hai
 With this step of the government, the traders will get a tax of two percent tax, and the government will also have a big income, the scope of tax payers will increase considerably
 is hafte badha kaarobaaraisi tarah se baapu bazaar main sanganeri print ke vyapaaree rohit kaa kahana he ki notebandi se bikri to jiro ho gai thi lekin pichley saat dinon main vyapaar bad rahaa he
 Instead of cash, people are using the card at the shops
 sarkaar ham chote vyapaariyon ko do fisadi kii chhot detii he to ham logon ko bahut phayda hoga, hamaare liye to do fisadi bahut hota he
 We would also like customers to use the card
 card se graahak zyada kharch karata he
 At the same time, for us too, fear of income tax and sales tax raid will be disturbed
 vahiin puure rajasthan kii baat karen to i-pement kii majaburi kii vajah se do karod se kam ke turn over vaale kareeb ek lakh vyapari tex ke daayre main aaenge or do lakh se zyada vyapaariyon kii tex kii raashi badhegi
 In such a situation, the government is pleased with the decision to take 6 percent tax instead of eight

 While both the Sadhvi election rallies held at Trilokpuri and New Ashok Nagar saw huge crowds, a large number of police forces and media were deployed
 apni pichhali galati se sikh lete hue kendriya mantri ne is baar koi vivaadit bayaan to nahin diya, lekin unhone paanch aisi baaten kahin jo gaur farmaane laayak he-1) 'main zyada kuch nahin kahuungi, log bura maan jate hai

 '4)' i will not take anyone's name

 '5)' Now give me the songs so that the media people also get something for today
 'khaas baat yah bhi rahi ki sadhvi apni donon reliyon ke dauraan lagbhag muskuraati raheen
 Not only this, whenever the Sadhvi laughs in the order of speaking from the stage, the listener would laugh with them

 unhone kaha ki bijepi mamata sarkaar kii aloktantric koshishon se rukegi vaali nahin he
 The fight between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress has been going on for a long time

 BJP President Amit Shah has set a target of winning more than 20 seats out of the total 42 Lok Sabha seats here
 2014 main bijepi kaa janaadhar bengal main kaaphi badha tha
 If you look at the data of 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got a total of 17
 02 fisadi vot mili the or kul 2 siten mili thim
 BJP became the third party in terms of vote percentage, followed by a significant increase in bjp's vote percentage in the assembly elections as well

 BJP leader Mukul Roy was going to hand over the party's flag to some of the Trinamool Congress councilors at the party's new office in Hastings House in Kolkata when the central leadership abruptly stopped the program
 paala badalane vaale parshadon se chale jane ke liye kah diya gaya
 At the same time, Roy was given a clear message that there is no place in the party for every Trinamool leader willing to join BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko rajya main 18 siten milane ke baad roy ne trinmul netaaon ko party main laane ke prayaas tej kar die
 Roy wants to bring more and more Trinamool leaders to the party but among the leaders he wants to include, many of them are leaders with dubious image whom BJP does not want to take
 sandigdh chhavi vaale trinmul ke aise kai netaa sharada ghotaale kii jaanch ke daayre main rahe hai
 Many leaders are of criminal background who have been openly promoting violence
 party netritv ko shikaayat mil rahi thi ki party main shaamil hone vaale trinmul ke kuch netaa rob dikhaane lage the or aapasi dushmani paidaa kar rahe the, jisase alaakaman bahut naaraaz tha
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP opened the doors for the rebel leaders of the Trinamool, which benefited the party immensely
 mana jaataa he ki roy ne in netaaon ko party main shaamil karte samay unki prishthbhumi kii thik se jaanch nahin kii thi
 Some of the suspected Trinamool leaders joining the party include controversial MLA Shankdev Panda, who has been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI in the Saradha scam
 aise hi ek netaa hai monirul islam jin par rajnatik virodhiyon ke khilaaf nafrat bhare bhaashan dene kaa aarope rahaa he
 In total, three Trinamool mlas and around 50 councilors have joined the BJP after the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki kuch parshad dobaaraa trinmul main waapas laut gaye hai
 The situation reached such a point that the old BJP leaders, who had worked hard for years to establish the party in Bengal, began to feel isolated
 tanaav badaae se bhaajapa ke rashtriya sanyukt mahasachiv (sanghathan) shiv prakaash or kailash vijayawargeey ne apni naaraazgi jagajaahir kar di thi
 Shiv Prakash said, "whoever joins BJP will have to adopt the philosophy of the party
 '' to rashtriya mahasachiv or bengal ke prabharee vijayawargeey ne saaf kar diya ki trinmul ke keval unheen netaaon ko bhaajapa main shaamil kiya jayega jinaki chhavi saaf-suthri rahi he or sthaneey str par jinaki sweekaaryata he
 Apart from this, there will be no condition like changing the frost to be given a post in the party or ticket in the upcoming elections
 unhone ghoshnaa kii, ''jin netaaon par rishwat (cat mani) lene kaa aarope hoga, unhen party main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 "the purpose of examining Trinamool Congress leaders who want to join BJP is to show that it is different from other parties
" isi chhavi ke aadhaar par 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko lag rahaa he ki vah mamata banerjee ko satta se bedakhal kar sakati he
 Prashant Ray, retirement professor at Presidency University, says, "expanding the party by including a large number of Trinamool Congress leaders may put the BJP in danger of becoming a refugee for Trinamool rebels
" 
 
 or is par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh jaise anushaasit sanghathan kii najar hone se aise kadamon kaa virodh hona tay tha
 "another reason is that BJP got 40 percent votes in the Lok Sabha elections due to the transfer of votes of the Left parties
 kooch bihar se bhaajapa ke netaa deeptiman sengupta kehete hai, ''bhaajapa ko vampanthi partiyon ke samarthakon ke voton kaa phayda mila
 The only way to keep this vote safe is to avoid the involvement of tainted Trinamool leaders in the party
 ''2021 ke vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue bhaajapa khud ko ek alag party ke rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Due to this, due diligence is being taken in taking the leaders of Trinamool

 These poets include Shamsher, Nagarjuna, Agnayya and Kedarnath Agarwal
 in chaaron kaviyon ko ek jagah par ek hi samay main, vah bhi sargarbhit bhoomika ke saath padhanaa behad sukhad or aanandadaayak anubhav he
 The long but interesting poem of Agnayya is not only the incurable veena, but there are also poems like Agarwal's whenever i saw him
 shabd saadhakon ke athak lekhan ko ek sthaan par parosna bhi chunauti bharaa kaam he
 But both the selector and the editor (anamika, Madan Kashyap) are entitled to piety for this effort
 is sankalan ke chaaron kavi yun to alag-alag bhugolic, anubhavik jameen ke hai lekin chaaron kii swar lahariyaan kahin na kahin ek duusare ke yahaan awajahi karti milti hai
 The specialty of this compilation is that before reading every poet, comments and pedestals have been written to make the readers familiar with the background (social, cultural, ideological experience, etc
) of that poet
 sankalan kii kavitaayen vaise to swatantra rup se or kavita sankalan ke taur par bhi pehle chap chuki hai
 But it is a pleasant thing to have four well-liked poems available in one place
 kiafiyat naam se likhi bhoomika main anamika or kashyap likhte hai, ''in kaviyon ne apane bachapan main hi swatantraaa ke sangharsh ke saath-saath hindi samaaj or bhartiya rashtriya nirmaan ke sangharshon ko dekha

 Shamsher is the eldest in age
 '' yah asal main in kaviyon kii kri tiyon main pravesh ke liye sirf ku chha raste or pagarhndiyaan banane kii koshish he
 Every poet has his own land
 un sabhi kii apni-apni kala or style, jisamen ve pathakon se samvaad karte hai
 There is a string where these poets seem to be in a circle
 shiksha or bachche nagarjun or agarwal kii kavitaaon main tis ban kar ubharate hai
 Nagarjuna's 'master' poem was written in 1953, but it gives a glimpse of the pain of a master and the behavior of officer and minister
 ghun khaae shateeron par kii, barhakhadi vidhaataa baanche / pha tii bhit he, chat chuti he, aale par bisatuia naache / barasaakar bebas bacchon par minute-minute main paanch tamaache / dukharan master gadhate hai kisi tarah aadam ke saanche
 Aggarwal's 'I am husband - now you are wife' poem also gives a glimpse of the system of education and school: used to write very well / Where ever cock was made / Eats ear-umethi / Cheek with red slap Was jinnata vishay kii vividhta to khayr he hi
 You will find people attacking the nature of humans on the pretext of an agnostic snake: Snake! / You are not civilized / You have not even come to settle in the city
 ek baat puuchhuun-tab kaise siikhaa dasna- / vish kahaan se paaya? prem par sabhi ne likhaa he lekin shamsher kii baat hi alag haih dravya nahin kuch mere paas / phi r bhi main karata hum pyaar / rup nahin ku chha mere paas / phi r bhi main karata hum pyaar / maine kitne kiye upaay / kintu na mujhse chuta prem / uski baat-baat main chal he / phi r bhi he vah anupam sundar / maaya hi uskaa sambal he / phi r bhi he vah anupam sundar
 Overall, this book is also readable because it has also provided a way for the readers to enter the poem of these poems

 a day after Priyanka Gandhi's hurt statement about the attacks on her husband Robert Vadra, BJP today said that Priyanka wants people to refrain from personal attacks, but her own leader Narendra Modi has got various issues including her marital status

 The court asked the central government to place the old orders in this matter before the court
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko dastavej na dene par kaha is gambhir mudde par aapkaa vyavhaar laaparvaahee bharaa dikh rahaa he
 The court told the Center that the government did not impose orders and documents of the Supreme Court on the basis of which the order of the NGT was not stayed
 pehle sarkaar saare dastavej daakhil kare phir sunwaayee kii jaaegi
 Significantly, in an important decision in the month of July last year, the National Green Tribunal, or NGT, ordered a ban on 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi
 is aadesh ke tahat engiti ne artio se puraani deazal gadiyon ke registration radd karne kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 On this, the government told the Green Court that at present there is no provision under which diesel vehicles older than 15 years and following BS1 or BS2 standards can be removed from the roads
 baari udyog evam saarvajanik upkram mantralay ne kaha tha ki engiti kaa diya aadesh motor vaahan adhinium ke praavdhaanon kaa ‘ulanghan’ he
 The Central Government has challenged that order of NGT in the Supreme Court
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal july ke maheene main ek ahm faisle main neshnal green tribunal yani NGT ne dilli main 10 saal puraani deazal gadiyon par bain ke aadesh die the
 Under this order, the NGT issued an order canceling the registration of old diesel vehicles from the RTO
 is par sarkaar ne green court se kaha tha ki is samay aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he jiske tahat 15 saal se puraane or bies 1 yaa bies 2 maanakon kaa paalan karne vaale dijal vaahan sadakon se hataae ja sake
 The Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises had said that the order given by the NGT is a 'violation' of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act

 She was later admitted to the hospital, where doctors declared her dead

 Devendra Fadnavis has once again become CM and Ajit Pawar has sworn in as the deputy CM

 The government-forming formula was also decided between the three
 mana ja rahaa tha ki shanivaar ko rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari se teenon dal milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karenge
 Amidst all this, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar, who emerged as a kingmaker, did a political game overnight that the political game of Maharashtra was overturned
 ensipi kaa samarthan nahin: sharad pavanjit pavaar ensipi vidhayak dal ke netaa hai
 In such a situation, he had the letter of support signed by the legislative parties
 aise main unhone sharad pavaar sahit tamaam ensipi netaaon ko peeche chhodte hue bijepi ko samarthan dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Please tell that officially the letter of support of the leader of the Legislature Party is valid
 ajit pavaar ke is faisle ke baad sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ye ensipi kaa samarthan nahin he
 We have nothing to do with this
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki ajit pavaar ne ensipi ke vidhayakon ko todakar apane saath mila liya he
 At the same time, Congress leader Tariq Anwar said that this is a big conspiracy, which was kept secret
 patr kaa durupyogensipi ke pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha ki vidhayakon ke patr kaa galat istemaal hua
 Ajit Pawar misused the letter of the pro-mlas
 logon kii samasya ke liye saath aaen: ajit pawarensipi se baghawat kar bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane k baad ajit pavaar ne kaha ki ham logon kii samasya ke liye saath aae hai
 We want to end the problem of farmers
 unki bhalaai ke liye hi sarkaar main aae hai
 He said that the people who had chosen to form the government
 unheen ko sarkaar banani bhi chahie
 This means that BJP was chosen by the people of Maharashtra for the government and should form its government
 isse yah baat sabit ho gai he ki ensipi par ajit pavaar kii pakad sharad pavaar se zyada he
 This is the reason why they have taken the step of forming a government by joining around 22 to 25 mlas of NCP
 pavaar ke is kadam se shivasena-congress-ensipi gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke armaanon par pani phir gaya he
