 aise main sawaal uthta he ki in bacchon ko sabase zyada khatra kahaan se he?jaankaar maanate hai ki masuumon ko sabase zyada khatra ghar, aas-pados or rishtedaaron se he
 Apart from this, many times children in schools and child ashrams also suffer from vaginosis
 kyonki sarkaar ne yahaan par bacchon kii suraksha ke pukhta intjaam nahin kiye hai, aise main sawaal ye bhi he ki samaaj main teji se bad rahe is kalank ko kaise mitaayaa jaae?bacchon ko yon shoshan jaise aparaadhon se bachaane ke liye police, ballashram or aspataalon main rahane vaale karmchaariyon ko samvedansheel bananaa hoga
 Attention should be paid to the behavior of people living at home and in the neighborhood
 mata-pita ko bacchon ko paryaapt vakt dena chahie
 Children should be kept away from people with suspicious behavior
 bacchon ko aparichit logon ke saath khilne or ghar se baahar jane se rokna chahie
 Now is the time to pay special attention to the upbringing of children
 masuumon ke khilaaf yon aparaadh karne waalon ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaane kaa

 But you have to go, or what the community will say

 There was no need for a taxi, the bus did not have the courage to strike, so they took the auto

 To prevent the speed of sunlight, a poor farmer-like, forced awning to prevent his death

 How did you die What happened? How did all this happen? Till yesterday it was fine, like a silence after questions

 There was a fresh death and the body was still lying, so the voice could not rise high
 badi ladki haridwar main rahati thi
 He was wired up
 shav barf kii silliyon ke bich rakhaa hua tha
 It was possible to starve for four or five hours in such a hot summer, but it was difficult to bear the dry throat
 ek tub main pani bharkar barf daal di gayi thi
 The sound of washing the glasses, keeping them, was breaking the sad silence
 kabhi-kabhi pani kii chaah main aparaadh-bodh si grast jaisi awaajen bikhri hui thim
 The mourning of the wife of the dead body surrounded by women had now turned into a hiccup
 badi ladki ke intjaar main log dhoop main jal rahe the
 Waiting people were dying less of the grief of the deceased and the pain of the girl not yet coming
 udaasi bechaini main badal rahi thi
 For a long time, the aching people were unable to bend their knees on the ground
 batarasiyon ko chuppi khal rahi thi
 Gradually, the people started confessing to acquaintances and whispering
 laash barf main lipati padi thi
 Drinking water was running low due to heat
 ummid nahin thi ki itnaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 The taxi from Haridwar to the border of Delhi came right but was stuck in a jam as soon as it entered Delhi

 No one was seen from far and wide like no one is seen in the office of the losing party

 He gets bored very quickly
 vaise bhi yah samay uske pansadeeda serial kaa tha
 Suddenly he saw two children running towards him
 usne apana dhyaan idhar laga diya
 There was competition to reach both of them as before
 ek baarah-chaudaa varsh kaa hoga or doosraa saat-aath varsh ke lagbhag
 In the hope of not knowing in that scorching heat, they were coming running towards it
 bada ladkaa pehle pahunchaa tha
 As soon as he saw the dead body lying on the ice block, he stopped fearing
 usne apane sir par haath rakh liya tha
 The younger one also arrived and looked at the elder with questioning eyes
 bade ladke ne chote kaa haath uske sir par rakh diya
 The faces of both were saying that they had seen something untoward
 ve kisi ummid main daudte hue aaye the
 Perhaps seeing the awning, they must have thought that there is a marriage
 donon bhaagane ke kaaran haaf rahe the
 The elder was wearing a neckerchief and shirt and the younger one was in a neckerchief
 donon nange pair the or sir par haath rakhe ab bheed ko ghur rahe the
 When the bare feet started burning, both stood in the shade
 unke liye vahaan ruknaa aavashyak nahin tha, parantu shaayad ek aatankapurna vivashtaa thi yaa phir itani dhoop main daudkar aane ke kaaran ve waapas lautne kaa saahas kho chuke the
 There was a hope of getting something while coming, but on the way to leaving
 
 
 
 The little boy may have felt thirsty
 vah dhire-dhire pani pine ke liye us ore bad rahaa tha, jahaan pani kaa tub padaa tha
 On reaching there, he asked for water from the palms by making oak, but upon seeing that half-naked gruesome child, the gentleman standing there scolded him
 pyaas kii vivashtaa main jab chote ladke ne dobaaraa pani maanga to ve sajjan daant piste hue use maarane ko daude-se the
 The ice cold water was for the seated people, not the stray boy
 chota ladkaa vivash, niraash-sa bade ke paas khadaa ho gaya tha, uske hont suukh rahe the or vah unhen baar-baar jeebh pherakar tar kar rahaa tha
 Meanwhile the wait was over
 beti aa gayi thi
 He was taken out of ice blocks to bathe the body

 The little boy once again dampened his lips with his tongue

 a few hours after the ball tempering incident, the Australian government asked CA to remove Steve Smith from the captaincy
 australia ke pradhanmantri mailkam turnbul ne bhi is ghatana ko 'chaunkaane vaala or niraashajanak kaha tha
 Later Steve Smith had to relinquish the captaincy of Australia's cricket team
 upakptain david warner ko bhi unke pad se haath dhonaa padaa
 Steve Smith and David Warner were banned for one year
 iske alaava camran bencroft par 9 maheene kaa pratibandh laga
 It was David Warner who instigated Bencroft for ball tempering
 vahiin smith ko is ghatana ke bare main puri jaankaree thi
 But, they did not try to stop it
 ball tempring vivaad ke baad australia ke captain steve smith par isisi ne ek test match ke liye nilambit kiya tha or match fees kaa 100 pratishat jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya tha
 In addition to Smith, the ICC awarded 3 demerit points to Australian opener Cameron Bencroft

 He was accused of violating Level Two of the ICC Code of Conduct
 gudgaanv main chaar saal kaa ek baccha dharne par baitha he
 The four-year-old innocent is sitting on a dharna outside the commissioner's house to recover her missing mother
 bachche ke pita bhi aamaran anshan par baithe hai
 Two months have passed since the woman went missing but the police have not yet been able to trace the woman
 baccha police se guzaar laga rahaa he, 'mujhe meri maa se milaao

 Two months passed, but no clue was found to the police
 police kii kaaryastylee se dukhi hokar pati shiv kumaar va uske parijan 25 june ko disi aphis ke saamne dharne par baith gaye
 Even after four days of picketing, when the police and administration did not take any care of them, Shiv Kumar sat on fast unto death
 parivaar kaa aarope he qi suman or uske dedh saal ke bete kaa apharan kiya gaya he
 The family also met the Chief Minister 20 days after the kidnapping, on whose direction the police also registered a case of kidnapping against two people, the family also handed over one accused to the police but the police failed to find Suman yet

 At the same time, no administration official is ready to speak on this matter
 purv captain ian chapel ne bharat ke khilaaf aagaamee vanade siries ke liye sahmati jataane ke liye cricket australia kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki ‘galat samay’ par yojit kiye gayi maichon se team ke manobal par bura asar padegaa, kyonki yahaan spin kii mufeed pichon par unki ballebaaji kii kamajoriyaan ujagar ho jaaengi
 Teams from India and Australia will play one Twenty20 and 7 odis in this series
 chapel ne kaha ki yah puri siries sirf dhan ke liye yojit kii gai he
 Chappell wrote, 'agreeing for this purposeless tour of India and that too at the close of the Ashes series, it clearly shows that the dollar means more than understanding for Cricket Australia
 'unhone kaha, ‘austrailia ko test main milane vaali haar sirf record book ko hi nuksaan nahin pahunchaayegi, balki isse team kaa manobal bhi giregaa
 Australia's weakness has been batting during this period and battling with good spin bowling will reveal their batting weaknesses
 'chapel ne kaha, ‘landan main haal main lards par hue kaarykram main purv khilaadiyon ne haalchaal poochne se pehle tippanee kii thi ki australia kii ballebaaji ko kya ho gaya he?’ Sachin Tendulkar came for fielding in the third season during England's innings on the fourth day of the first Test cricket match due to viral fever and due to this he may have to come out to bat at number seven in India's second innings
 is siries ke niyamon ke anusaar khilaadi ko tab tak ballebaaji karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi jab tak ki vah jitne samay tak maidan se baahar rahaa, uski team ballebaaji karte hue utana samay maidan par nahin bitaa de yaa phir uski team ke paanch wicket girane ke baad hi use ballebaaji kii anumati di jaaegi
 If Tendulkar comes to bat at number seven, his dream of scoring 100th international century at the historic ground of Lord's will hardly be fulfilled
 unki umr ko dekhte hue yah lords par shatak banane kaa sambhavat: unka aakhri mauka hoga
 His contemporary greats Ricky Ponting and Brian Lara have also failed to score centuries on this ground
 tendulkar pehali pari main 34 ran par out ho gaye the
 His highest score at Lord's is 37 runs
 bade-bujurg kah gaye hai ki aap apane padosi nahin chun sakate, lekin usase sambandh kaise rakhane hai yah aapke haath main hota he

 islamabad main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne saaf kar diya ki donon deshon ke bich rishte sudhaarney ke liye samgr vaarta hogi, jisaki ruparekha donon deshon ke videsh sachiv banaaenge
 a year and a half after the formation of Narendra Modi's government, the relationship between India and Pakistan seems to be standing on the ground of trust
 heart of asia conference main hissedari karne ke lievidesh mantri ke pakistan daureke bich jahaan 26 / 11 ke baad band ho chuki baatcheet kaa dedlock khul gaya he, vahiin bharat-pakistan ke bich aatankwaad ke khilaaf nai saajhedaari bhi dekhne ko mili he
 In a joint statement issued after Sushma Swaraj's meeting with Pakistan's wazir-e-azam Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said that both countries are ready to hold talks on Kashmir, Pakistan has expressed confidence to expedite the investigation into Mumbai attack 
 guuruuvaar ko sansad main bayaan dengi sushamabharat kii videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne islamabad main ek sanyukt press conference main samgr vaarta ko lekar elaan kiya
 He said, 'at first we knew it as Composite Dialogue, then it was called Resume Dialog, now we are giving it the name of Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue
 mujhe yah bataate hue khushi ho rahi he ki bharat or pakistan samgr baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 Sushma further said that she has come to India saying that she will give a statement on this in Parliament on Thursday, so she will not speak too much about it by following her decorum
 videsh mantrike is elaan ke baad ek saajha bayaan bhi jari kiya gaya
 Foreign Secretary will decide during the press conference Ruprepasajha, Sushma Swaraj, referring to the success of the NSA level talks of the two countries in Bangkok, said, “it is only after the success of the talks in Bangkok that we have decided to have a composite dialogue
 donon deshon ke videsh sachivon ko is ore kaarykram or ruparekha tay karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Many more things can also be added to it
 saamaanya arthon main samajhen to samgr baatcheet kaa matlab jammu-kashmir, siachin, aatankwaad, narkotics se lekar sar creek jaise tamaam ahm muddon ko baatcheet main shaamil karne ke taur par liya jaataa he
 It was started in 1997
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke shashan main ise compojit dialog kaa naam diya gaya tha
 The Shiv Sena, enraged by the talks, was welcomed by the Akalis
 On the other hand, the Shiv Sena, the bjp's ally in power in Maharashtra, has been fueled by the indo-pak talks
 shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne kaha, 'jab tak pakistan hamaare desh main aatankwaad khatm nahin karata, kisi bhi tarah ke baatcheet kaa koi phayda nahin he
 We hanged Kasab in Mumbai, but the other accused was given bail by Pakistan, which is roaming freely
 'haalanki punjab main bijepi ke sahyogi akali dal ne is baatcheet kaa swaagat kiya or ummid jataai ki isse donon deshon ke bich rishte sudharenge
 The 57 passengers and four crew members of a Jet Airways flight that landed at the airport on Thursday night escaped narrowly when the front wheel of the plane left after landing here and it slipped on the runway
 jet airways ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki indore se ahmedabad aayaa jet airways kaa vimaan 9dablyoo 2510 ahmedabad hawaondde par utarane ke baad iske agle pahiye main khami aane ke chalate ranve par ruk gaya
 The spokesman said that all passengers and crew members were safe
 unhen vimaan se utaar liya gaya he or terminal imaarat main le jaaya gaya he jahaan jet airways kaa staff unki dekhbhaal kar rahaa he
 The incident affected the movement of planes at the airport for three hours
 aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ke liye apane chunaav ghoshnaa patr ko lagu karne kaa yah aitihaasik mauka he or unhen is jimmedaari se bachane kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 The AAP did not contest the election to sit in the opposition, nor were the voters who voted for it choosing the opposition for themselves
 isliye agar baarik-sa bhi mauka he, to aap ko samarthan jutaney, sarkaar banane or chalaane kii koshish kerani chahie
 If someone supports him from outside, or lets him run the government absent from voting during assembly, then AAP should bear the responsibility of running the government
 uske paas yah rasta hameshaa hoga ki koi party yaa emele agar usase galat kaam karaane kii koshish karegaa yaa baanh marodega, to vah sarkaar gir jane degi, par ‘aniatik’ samjhauta nahin karegi
 Any honest party should do the same
 sarkaar banaakar hi aap aadhi dar par bijli dene, 700 litre muft pani, sabhi gaiyrkanoonee coloniyon ko regularise karne, muslim yuvaaon par lage farji mukademe waapas lene, sarkari naukariyon main essi-asti or obisi kaa rigerveshan sakhti se lagu karne or backlog vaikency bharne, karpshan karne vaale locasevak ko naukari se nikaalane, jail bhejne or sampatti jabt karne, dilli ke tamaam safai karmchaariyon or driveron ko permanent karne, urdu or punjabi bhashaa kii haisiyat badhaane jaise saikadon kadam uthaa paaegi, jiskaa usne apane ghoshnaa-patr main vaada kiya he
 If the BJP or the Congress stumbles upon these tasks, they will do so at their own risk
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki dilli kaa janadesh spasht nahin he
 The only clarity in this mandate is that the people of Delhi have rejected the Congress
 congress ko riject karte hue logon ne do vikalpon ko aajamaaya
 Of these, BJP got 32 seats and AAP 28 seats
 jaahir he 70 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi ke liye sarkaar bananaa aasaan nahin he
 The only way for the BJP to form a government is to support it
 maujuuda rajnatik ganit ke hisaab se iske asaar kam hai
 But can the same thing be said about you
 shaayad nahin
 If AAP claims to form the government, it may also get the support of BJP
 aap ko iske liye koshish kerani chahie
 Even if you do not get support, if you claim to form a government with the claim of implementing your manifesto, will the BJP oppose it
 chunaav ne or usase bhi badhkar itihaas ne arvind kejariwal kii party aap ko ek aise mode par khadaa kar diya he, jahaan se unka uthaaya hua har kadam behad mahatvapurn hoga

 There will be no CBI inquiry into the death of IAS Ravi
 This woman IAS officer knew from the days of training

 The CID department of the Karnataka Police is investigating the case keeping in view the conversations between DK Ravi and the woman IAS officer
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki dike ravi ne apni maut se pehle is mahila saathi ko kuch massej bhi bheje the
 These women officers are employed in southern Karnataka
 gauratlab he ki rajya ke vaanijya vibhaag main atirikt ayukta di
 K
 ravi 16 march ko apane aadhikarik awaas ke kamare main pankhe se fande par latake paae gaye the
 His body was seen by his wife, Kusuma, when she did not answer the call and opened the door of the house with a duplicate key
 police ne ravi kii maut ko pratham drushtya khudakushi kaa maamla bataaya he or rajya sarkaar ne maamle kii jaanch kaa jimmaa aapraadh jaanch vibhaag (siaidi) ko saunp diya he
 However, Ravi's family members say there is a conspiracy behind his death and the case should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)

Double tap if you cannot wait for the magic of this duo to unfold! @man_on_ledge @skfilmsofficiala post shared by Tubelight (@tubelightkieid) on Apr 26, 2017 at 11:24pm PDT China, while trying to address India's concerns over the china-pakistan Economic Corridor, said it had 'no direct connection' with the Kashmir issue and welcomed New Delhi to join the 'one Belt One Road' project
 china ke videsh mantri wang yi ne 14-15 may se hone vaale ‘van belt van road’ (obioar) shikhar sammelan ke sambandh main yojit ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, haalanki (koi) bhartiya netaa yahaan nahin honge, lekin obioar shikhar sammelan main bharat kaa ek pratinidhi hoga
 According to the news of the language- Wang said, we welcome the Indian representative and members of the Indian business and financial community to participate in the talks at the summit
 unhone kaha ki is shikhar sammelan main 28 raashtrapatiyon evam pradhanmantriyon ke bhaag lene kii sambhaavna he
 Wang said, OBOR is for the common development of all participants, so we welcome India to play an active role in building OBOR
 wang ne kaha ki 46 arab dollar ke china-pakistan aarthik galiyare kaa makasad aarthik he
 He said, its objective is economic cooperation and development
 46 arab america dollar kii mahatvakankshi yojana he
 Under this, China and Pakistan are building an economic corridor of about 3,000 km to connect Gwadar Port in the Arabian Sea with Xinjiang
 yah kadam china main tel parivahan ke liye ek nayaa or sasta malwahak maarg kholegaa
 Also, Chinese goods will be exported to the Middle East and Africa through this route
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki sipiisi or guadar bandargah china or paak kii sainya kshamtaayen badhayega tathaa arab sagar main chini nausena kii aasaan pahunch ko sambhav banayega
 By having a naval base at Gwadar, Chinese ships will also be able to use the port for the repair and maintenance of their fleet in the Indian Ocean region
 aisi koi bhi suvidha china kii nausena ke bhavishya ke mishnon ke liye use sahyog pradaan karne vaali pehali oversij suvidha hogi
 CPEC will pass through Pakistan's largest province of Balochistan
 is galiyare se china kaa muslim bahul praant shinjiyang pakistan ke guadar port se judega
 Under this project, an 1100 km long motorway will be built between Karachi and Lahore city
 rawalpindi or chini seemaa ke bich karakoram hive ko puri tarah se nayaa banaaya jayega
 Under this, the main rail line between karachi-peshawar will also be upgraded and by December 2019, the train will run at 160 kmph on this route
 pakistan ke rail network ko china ke dakshini shinjiyang railway se joda jayega
 India objected to China over this corridor as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 china ne yah kehete hue pariyojna kaa bachaav kiya he ki isse kshetreey vikaas main madad milegi
 India's concern is also about Gwadar Port
 is port ke jariye china bharat ko gherne kii ranneeti par nishchit hi aage badhegaa
 New routes will be built along the border connecting Pakistan to China which is adjacent to India
 china kii vaajahi yahaan or bad jaaegi
 (inputs from language and other agencies) bhashaa kii khabar ke mutabik- wang ne kaha, ham shikhar sammelan main vaarta main shaamil hone ke liye bhartiya pratinidhi or bhartiya vyapaarik evam vittiya samudaay ke sadasyon kaa swaagat karte hai

 Wang said that the $ 46 billion china-pakistan Economic Corridor has economic motives
 unhone kaha, iskaa makasad aarthik sahyog evam vikaas he
 The ambitious plan is US $ 46 billion
 iske tahat china or pakistan arab sagar main guadar bandargah ko shinjiyang se jodne ke liye kareeb 3,000 kilometre lanbaa aarthik galiyara bana rahe hai
 This step will open a new and cheaper freight route for oil transportation in China
 saath hi is raste se chini vastuon kaa madhya purv or africa main niryaat hoga
 Experts believe that the CPEC and Gwadar Port will increase the military capabilities of China and Pakistan and make the Chinese Navy's easy access to the Arabian Sea possible
 guadar main nausainik adda hone se chini jahaaj hind mahaasaagar kshetra main apane bede kii marammat or rakrakhaav jaise kaary ke liye bhi bandargah kaa istemaal kar paaenge
 Any such facility would be the first overseas facility to support the Chinese Navy for its future missions
 sipiisi pakistan ke sabase bade praant baluchistan se hokar gujaregaa
 The corridor will connect China's Muslim-majority province of Xinjiang with Pakistan's Gwadar Port
 is project ke antargat 1100 kilometre kaa lanbaa motorve karachi or lahore shahar ke bich main banaaya jayega
 The Karakoram highway between Rawalpindi and the Chinese border will be completely rebuilt
 iske tahat karachi-peshawar ke bich kii mukhya rail line ko bhi apgrade kiya jayega or disambar 2019 tak is root par train kii raftaar ko 160 kimi prati ghante kii se chalaaya jayega
 Pakistan's rail network will be connected to China's Southern Xinjiang Railway
 bharat ne is galiyare ko lekar china se aapatti jataai, kyonki yah paak adhigrahit kashmir se hokar gujarata he
 China has defended the project, saying it would help in regional development
 bharat kii chintaa guadar port ko lekar bhi he
 China will definitely move forward on the strategy of encircling India through this port
 pakistan ko china se jodne vaali seemaa par nae raaston kaa nirmaan hoga jo bharat se lage hue he
 China's bid will increase further here
 (inputs bhashaa or anya agenciyon se) After beating Bangladesh in the second semifinal of the Champions Trophy 2017, Team India has set a final date against Pakistan
 bharat or pakistan ke bich muqablon kii sankhya ab pehle ke mukaable kaaphi kam ho gayi he, aise main ek hi toornament main do baar bharat-paak muqabla cricket phens ke liye kisi tohfe se kam nahin he
 In the league stage, India defeated Pakistan by 124 runs in a one-sided match
 ab ravivaar ko 'fadars de' ke avasar par bharat ke paas pakistan ko haraane ke ek nahin balki do maukey hai
 While on the one hand at the Kennington Oval ground in London, the title of the Champions Trophy cricket tournament between India and Pakistan will be clash, on the other hand in hockey, both these teams will face each other
 viraat kohli kii aguwai main bhartiya cricket team ne to england main jhande gaade hi hai vahiin bhartiya hockey team bhi isi iraade se world hockey lig semifinal main khilne utari he
 The Indian men's hockey team made their World Hockey League semi-final win by defeating Scotland 4–1 in a match played at the Lee Valley Hockey Center in London on Thursday
 is match main bharat ke liye ramandeep ne do gol kiye, jabaki akashadip singh or harmanpreet singh ne ek-ek gol kiya
 Now the Indian team will face Pakistan on June 18
 pool bi kaa ye match bhartiya samaynusaar shaam 6
 It will start at 30
 vahiin bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket kaa mahamuqabla bhartiya samaynusaar dopaher 3 baje armbh hoga
 There is no doubt that most of the fans will focus on the arrogance on the cricket field
 lekin hockey main bhi in donon chir-pratidwandi tiimon ke bich muqabla hameshaa se hi romaanchak rahaa he
 Like cricket, India's hockey is heavy in hockey
 world hockey ranking main bharat chathe jabaki pakistan 13wein sthaan par kaabiz he
 The team that qualified well in this tournament will play in the Hockey World League Finals
 ye pratiyogta disambar main bhubaneshwar main kheli jaaegi
 indo-pak cricket matches in one part of London and indo-pak hockey matches in another part

 wo ajit pavaar par faisla palatney ke liye dabaav bana rahe hai
 How Fadnavis will prove his majority in the Assembly: Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister in Maharashtra on Saturday morning, but the question of lacquer is that from where will he bring the majority figure in the 288-member assembly
 haalanki bijepi daawa kar rahi he ki vah aasaani se bahumat sabit kar legi, lekin suurate haal kuch or he
 Most rebel mlas of NCP have returned
 aise main bahumat sabit karne kii dagar mushkil najar aa rahi he
 Fadnavis said - If Modi is there, it is possible that it was almost decided that in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP government will be formed
 uddhav thakare mukhyamantri ban jaaenge, tabhi baaji palat gai
 Devendra Fadnavis sat on the Chief Minister's chair
 maharashtra main khushiyon ke ladduon ne apana pataa badal liya
 In the BJP camp of Maharashtra, the season of happiness has come and amidst the colorful reception in Mumbai BJP office, CM Fadnavis said that if Modi is there then it is possible
 maharashtra main kisne palati haari hui bajipradhanmantri narendra modi karishmai hai, to unke saathi or kendriya grahamantri amit shah siyasat ke baazeegar
 For whom nothing is impossible
amit Shah was the brain behind maharashtra main bijepiki haari hui baaji ko jeet main tabdeel karne ke peeche amit shah kaa hi dimag tha
 The setting took place with Ajit Pawar overnight and in the morning the government was formed
 fadanvis ne mukhyamantri kii shapath le lee, to ajit pavaar ne up mukhyamantri ban gaye
 What is the mathematics of bjp's majority? After Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, the question now is how will the government prove its majority? However, BJP is claiming the support of more than 170 mlas
 bijepi ke paas uske apane 105 vidhayak hai
 The BJP claims that it has a letter of support from 54 NCP mlas
 iske alaava 15 nirdaleey or anya ke samarthan kaa daawa kar rahi he
 However, in reality the BJP seems unlikely to get the support of 54 NCP mlas
 jayant patil bole- ajit pavaar ke liye daravaaje khuleensipi ke vidhayak dal ke nae netajayant patilne ajit pavaar ko vaapasi kaa nyauta dete hue kaha ki jo paanch vidhayak ajit pavaar sahit ab bhi baagi hai, unke liye ensipi ke daravaaje khule hai
 If they want to come back, they are welcome
 jayant patil kaa kahana he ki jab floor test hoga, todavendra fadanvisasarkaar gir jaaegi
 49 of our 54 mlas are present with Sharad Pawar
 patil kaa kahana he ki ajit pavaar bijepi ke saath kyon gaye, yah samaj se pare he
 There was no doubt or doubt in our mind about this
 shanivaar ko hi jayant patil ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunaa gaya tha
 State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Pratip Chaudhary said on Thursday that in the sting operation of online news portal Cobrapost, some bank officials' suggestions about splitting deposits to avoid tax are undeniably mild but clearly This is not a criminal case
 online portal cobrapost dwaara bank par mani-londring main shaamil hone ke aarope ke bare main puche jane par choudhary ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘pratham drushtya jo baaten hamaare saamne ai hai, usamen aparaadh jaisaa kuch nahin he
 If someone asks you to divide your deposits
 masalan 50 lakh rupee kii jamaa ko 50 hajaar rupee yaa ek lakh rupee main vibhajit karne ke liye kahata he
 These are like mild things but it is undesirable
 ’’ He also said that nothing has been found in this case that appears to have benefited the employee
 tippaniyan Chaudhary said, "what has come out in Cobrapost's report is not corruption
 kuch gatividhiyaan hai jise mani landring yaa kar chori kaa naam diya gaya he
 There is no case that employees have benefited
 kuch maamalon main kar dene se bachane ke liye apni jamaaon ko vibhajit karte hai, lekin aisa nahin hona chahie
 '' bank ne is khulaase ke baad apane teen adhikariyon ko nilambit kiya he
 Asked about the bank's allegations of money-laundering by online portal Cobrapost, Chaudhary told reporters, "prima facie the things that have come to us, there is nothing like crime
 agar koi aapako apni jamaaon ko vibhajit karne ke liye kahe
 For example, asks to divide a deposit of 50 lakh rupees into 50 thousand rupees or one lakh rupees
 yah halki baaten jaisi hai lekin yah avaanchit he
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki is maamle main aisa kuch nahin paaya gaya he jisase lage ki karmchaaree ko laabh hua he
 The comments choudhary ne kaha, ‘‘cobrapost kii report main jo kuch saamne aayaa he, vah bhrashtachar nahin he
 There are some activities which have been named money laundering or tax evasion
 aisa koi maamla nahin he jisase karmchaariyon ko phayda hua he
 In some cases divide your deposits to avoid paying taxes, but this should not be the case
 ’’ The bank has suspended three of its officers after the revelations

 Ashwin took seven wickets for 66 runs during his career-best bowling and was adjudged 'man of the Match'
 unhone kaha, ‘aaj wicket thodaa dhimaa pad gaya tha
 The wicket was helping, but the way Faf (du Plessis) and (hashim) were playing Amla, we needed to do some good balls

 There is an ongoing news in the US that indian-american MP Tulsi Gabbard has refused to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Howdy Modi program in Houston
 is maamle ne tab tool pakadaa jab orgenigeshan of minurities of india (OFMI) ko tulsi gabord ke prachaar team ke ek sadsy ne ye baat kahi
 Howdy Modi program to be held on 22 September
 tulsi gabord 2020 main america main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaar bhi hai
 But, this news has been proved wrong
 america se yah jaankaree mili he ki 22 sitambar ko tulsi gabord kaa iova main kaarykram he, isliye ve pradhanmantri narendra modi ke houdi modi kaarykram main nahin shaamil ho paaengi
 But, after this, Tulsi Gabbard herself will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York
 iske alaava tulsi gabord houdi modi kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke swaagat ke liye ek video bhi bhejengi
 News running on OFMI website
 Ofmi
 According to an article published in org, this refusal of Tulsi Gabbard is being linked to the appeal of Congressman Ro Khanna, in which Khanna said that all US politicians of Hinduism should support polytheism
 hamen hindutv kaa tyaag karnaa hoga
 We should support equal rights for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians
 ab tulsi gabord ke is kadam se kaaphi vivaad ho rahaa he
 Whereas, Tulsi herself has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi four times on various occasions

 It is a matter of ethics
 united stats kamishan on international rilijiyas freedom ke anusaar bhartiya janata party kii hindutv ko lekar yah vichaardhaara he ki sabhi gaiyr-hindu videshi hai
 In 2013, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said that my identity is of Hindutva
 1923 main dharmik rashtravaadi raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke samarthak vidi saavarkar ne bhi kaha tha ki bharat sirf hinduon kaa desh hona chahie
 Only Hindus should remain in it
 2014 main america saansad tulsi gabord pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chunavi prachaar se jude ek event main bhi najar ai thim
 In this, he wore a BJP election scarf
 iske alaava, tulsi gabord ne narendra modi ko bhagavad gita bhent kii thi
 Tulsi was sworn in with this Gita in his hand
 2016 main tulsi gabord ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi aise raajnneetik udhaaharan hai jinase puri duniya ke netaaon ko siikhnaa chahie
 Tulsi Gabbard has faced a lot of opposition in the US since 2018
 yah isliye kyonki tulsi gabord kai american hindutvvaadi samoohon se judi hui thim
 Prominent among them are Overseas Friends of the BJP and Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh
 hindu swayamsevak sangh bharat ke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii shakha he
 Ramesh Bhutada is the vice-president of the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, who made large donations to Tulsi Gabbard
 bhutada ne texas se hi modi ko jitaane ke liye campan chalaaya tha
 Later, after Modi won, Bhutada said that this is India's second independence

 kaha jaataa he ki 14 farvari 1931 ko mahaan krantikari bhagat singh, raajaguru or sukhdev ko lahore ke ek jail main faansee di gai thi
 Also, many messages mention the hanging of Bhagat Singh on this day
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki soshal media par viral hone vaale ye massej galat he
 According to historical facts, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were not hanged on 14 February, but they were hanged on 23 March
 23 march ko puraa desh shahidi diwas ke rup main bhi manaaya he
 It is mentioned in many reports that the date of hanging of these three great revolutionaries was fixed on 24 March 1931, but suddenly the time of their execution was changed to 11 hours earlier and on 23 March 1931 in the Lahore jail at 7 pm : He was hanged at 30
 faansee se pehle jail main ye kitaaben pard rahe the bhagat singhis din sunai gai sajaakai massej main faansee par chadhaane kaa daawa nahin, balki faansee sunaae jane kii baat kahi jaati he
 However, this claim is also incorrect, because on 7 October 1930, the British court pronounced its 300-page judgment, in which Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were convicted in the Sands Murder and Assembly bombings and sentenced to death
 bhagat singh ko begunaah sabit karne ke liye faansee ke 86 saal baad bhi chal rahi kanoonee ladaikya he 14 farvari se rishtakai itihaas ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 14 farvari se bhagat singh kaa rishta ye he ki 14 farvari 1931 ko madan mohan malviya ji ne faansee se thik 41 din pehle ek marsi pitishan british bharat ke vysarai lord irvin ke daftar main daali thi, jisko irvin ne khaarij kar diya tha
 However, many reports say that no such claim is confirmed in history

 junk food kaa thappalogon kii yah soch ki fast food saste, tel vaale or rahasyamayi khaadya padaarthon se bane hote hai
 The company recently ran a campaign in which people were asked to openly ask questions about the menu
 jaise ki 'kya mcdonalds bif main keede hote hai?' or 'kya mcdonalds bans banane main usee chemical kaa istemaal hota he, jo yoga mat he?'2
 One of the problems behind mcdonald's in competition is competition from another traditional food chain
 logon ko lagata he ki mcdonalds apane khaane main na jane kya milaataa he, jabaki baaki restraan kaa minu zyada saamaanya or acchhee quality kaa hota he
 mcdonald USA President Mike Andreas said last month that he would reduce the number of ingredients in his food and bring new ways of cooking
 or hamen priservetives kaa istemaal karne kii bhi kya jarurat he?3

 lekin isse customer sarvice par ulataa asar padaa
 It took longer for people to make their choices
 kichan oparations bhi jatil ho gaye
 Mistakes started happening in the order
 ho saktaa he ki mcdonalds ab apane vailu miles kii sankhya ghataae or aisi sabhi vairaatiyaan, jo alag-alag topings ke saath ripet ho rahi hai

 Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken on Monday accused the Kejriwal government that a big scam has been done in the project of installing CCTV cameras in Delhi
 ajay maakan ne aarope lagaaya ki 13 oktober 2015 ko dilli main sisitivi camere lagane ke liye cabinet ne 130 karod ke project ko manjuuri di thi jiske liye november 2017 main tender jari kiye gaye, jisamen do bidar main se ek safal bidar rahaa or is tender ko radd kar diya gaya

 Maken said, "what is surprising is that the Expenditure Finance Committee of April 5, 2018, headed by Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia and PWD Minister Satendra Jain, decided that this proposal should be presented to the Cabinet with a detailed action plan
" will be kept
 matlab yah project mantrimandal ke dwaara bhi manjuur hona baaki he
 Maken said that surprisingly, the project was not approved by the Competent Authority before the RFP was invited and the tender was approved by the PWD
 5 april 2018 kii iefasi mints main yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki tender ko lekar is prakaar kii manjuuri nahin hoti he or principal secretary peedbludi ne cameti ko yah bhi bataaya ki kyonki yah suraksha kendrit project he isliye is kaam ko karwaane ke liye peedbludi kaaryakari sanstha hogi

 40 karod karne se sambadhit donon tenderon kii jaankariyaan dilli sarkaar kii website se jaanboojh kar hataa di gai kyonki sisitivi camere lagane kii is prakriya main bahut bada ghotaalaa hua he
 While other DTC buses and CCTV tedors installed in schools, the information is available on the website
 'apni naakaamiyon kaa thikra alji ke sir phodte hai kejariwal'maakan ne aarope lagaaya ki jab sisitivi lagane ke project ko cabinet kii manjuuri nahin di gai to usase pehle 571
 How was the new tender of 40 crores approved? Ajay Maken said that whatever work the Kejriwal government has done in the last three and a half years has crossed all the limits of corruption

 jaise taise ab ye CCTV kaa kaam hone vaala he to ajay maakan se juthi shikaayat dalwaayenge, or ACB ke zarie kaam rokenge

 unhone kaha, ‘yah dekhakar khushi hoti he ki pichley 20 saal se vah lagaataar khel rahaa he or apane cricket karier ke utaar chadhaavon ko dekha he
 But he has an appetite for runs
 uske naam kitne hi kirtiman ho chuke hai, lekin vah rukne kaa naam nahin letaa
 i have no words to praise him
 ’ anwar ne kaha, ‘main unhen bhavishya main isi fitness or farm ke saath khilne kii shubhakamana detaa hum

 granville austin ( shiksha sahitya) Balasaheb Thackeray has supported congress-ncp on several occasions to support Shiv Sena in support of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress are in Maharashtra for formation of Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra but Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray with NCCP chief Sharad Pawar Had a good relationship
 jis congress se vichaardhaara ke maamle main bal thakare kaa 36 kaa aankada rahaa, uskaa bhi unhone kai baar samarthan kiya he
 The antagonism of Muslim opposition made Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray a Hindu heart emperor and a natural friend of the BJP but parallel to this friendship was Bal Thackeray's friendship with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar
 aaj vahi sharad pavaar shivasena kii sabase badi mahatvakanksha ke khewanhaar bane hue hai
 What did Pawar write in his autobiography 'on My Terms'? Bal Thackeray's Seshad Pawarka relationship was very strange
 ve saarvajanik rup se pavaar ko aate kii bori kahkar unka majaak udaate the lekin raat main unako parivaar ke saath khaane par bhi bula lete the
 Sharad Pawar has written in his autobiography 'on My Terms' that Bala Saheb had the principle that if you once became his friend, he used to play him throughout his life
 pavaar ke mutabik, 'sitambar 2006 main jab meri beti supriya ne rajyasabha chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii to bala sahib ne mujhe phone karke kaha- sharad babu main sun rahaa hum, hamaari supriya chunaav ladane ja rahi he or tumne mujhe iske bare main bataaya hi nahin
 Why am i getting this news from others? i said that the Shiv sena-bjp alliance has already announced the name of its candidate against him
 aise main maine sochaa ki aapako kyon pareshaan karun
 On this Bal Thackeray said that i have seen Supriya since she used to be equal to my knees
 meraa koi bhi ummidavaar supriya ke khilaaf chunaav nahin ladega kyonki tumhaari beti meri beti he
 i asked him what would you do with the BJP, with whom you have an alliance? Thackeray immediately replied that don't worry about Kamalabai
 wo vahi karegi jo main kahuunga
 Shiv Sena's support to Congress is easy to guess how Pawar has a relationship with the Thackeray family
 2007 memrashtrapatichunaav main bal thakare ne endie ke ummidavaar bhairon singh shekhavat kii jagah upie kii ummidavaar pratibha devi patil kaa samarthan kiya

 gauratlab he ki jaipur ke hingonia gaushala kii mari hui or marati hui gaayon kii tasveeron ne puure desh ko dahala diya tha
 These pictures exposed the arrangements made by the Vasundhara government and the claims of the cow ministry in the country
 isi daag ko mitaane ke liye ab sarkaar ne gaayon ko viipi treetment dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Other cow sheds including Hingonia Gaushalas in the state are being given Rs 70 per cow and Rs 35 per calf
 hingonia gaushala ko bhi aapadaa prabandhan ke fund se hin paise jari kiye ja rahe hai
 The state government has issued a directive that these funds will be spent on their food
 isaki nigaraanee ke liye gaushala main sisitivi lagaana hoga or chaara khilaane ke sidi sarkaar ko saunpi jaaegi
 The government has set a target that all unclaimed cows will be taken to the cowshed and served
 philhal rajya ke 2319 gaushalaon main 6,71,452 gaayen hai
 After this announcement by the government, the number of cows in the cowshed is increasing continuously
 masalan, hingonia gaushala ko hin len
 Earlier there were around 9,000 cows, but since the time 70 rupees and 35 rupees have started getting for cow-calf
 vahaan gaayon kii sankhya 13 hajaar se zyada ho gai he
 In the circular issued by the government, it is also written that wherever the govans going for cow slaughter are rescued
 vahaan par jila colector prati gaay ke hisaab se aapadaa prabandhan se ye raashi jari kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, the question now arises that what will a cow eat for 70 rupees and a calf for 35 rupees? For example, one kilo of animal food will come at Rs 15 per kg and if you buy green fodder in retail, you will get Rs 5 per kg
 jabaki thok main ye sasta bhi ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress is looking at linking it with the politics of vote
 congress pravaktaa ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar aam janata kii bhalaai ke liye jo fund jari kar rahi he usamen to roj katautee karti ja rahi he magar gaay ke liye fund badha rahi he
 These funds are not being provided for the cow in the state, rather loot like Hingonia will now start in all the gaushalas
 haalanki har koi gaayon kii tahar khushkismat nahi he
 9727 per capita per year on Rajasthan Government Health, Family Welfare, Education, Sports, Arts & Culture, Urban Housing, Water and Waste Disposal, Welfare for SC ST, Labor, Social Welfare and Rural Development
 61 rupee kharch karti he
 That is, the government spends 26 rupees 65 paise on all kinds of welfare per person
 aapako bataa den ki rajasthan ke kisi bhi shahar main 28 rupye or gaanv main 25 rupye 16 paise tak kamaanevaala bipiel kii shrenee main hota he

 Terming the farmers' march in Mumbai as an example to surprise the power of the people, Congress President Rahul Gandhi today appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to demand their legitimate demands
 rahul ne aaj twit kar kaha, ‘‘mumbai ke liye nikaala gaya kisaanon kaa vishaal march logon kii satta kaa aashcharya dene vaali misaal he
 The Congress party is with the march of farmers and tribals against the indifference of the central and state governments

 Private hospitals in delhi-ncr are not taking profits from patients on drugs, consumption goods and treatment, but in a way robbing them
 haalat yah he ki kai dawaaon, upbhog vastu or nidaan par nijee aspataal 1,737 fisadi tak munafa vasuulate hai
 This is revealed by an analysis of the hospitals bill by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA)

 According to the news of Times of India, all these things, not the companies but the hospitals themselves, have increased this price
 NPPA ko pataa chalaa ki aspataal zyaadaatar aisi dawaaon, upkarnon or dysposbal kaa istemaal karte hai jo unke andar hi maujuud dukaanon par mili or marijon ke paas yah vikalp nahin hota ki inhen kam daam par baahar se kharid saken

 According to the analysis, hospitals consume more than 350 per cent to 1700 per cent profit on consumption items
 bina keemat niyantran vaali dawaaon par 160 se 1200 fisadi kaa munafa vasula jaataa he
 Hospitals get huge profits of 114 to 360 per cent even on controlled price medicines

 Such consumption goods do not come in scheduled medicines, hence cannot control their prices

 Book: Vivekananda's Autobiographer: Mani Shankar Mukherjee (shankar) Publisher: Prabhat publicationtranslation: Sushil Gupta: 250 rupeescover: All the books related to Paperbackswami Vivekananda are available in the market and there is little to read about them
 aise main agar unke jivan ke anchhue pahaluon ko padhane kaa mauka mili to kya baat he
 Something similar is in the book 'vivekananda's Autobiography' edited by famous Bengali writer Shankar
 mul rup se bangla main likhi gai yah kitaab pehali baar 2009 main prakashit hui
 The author has tried to describe Swami ji as his life story
 is kitaab main swami vivekanand kii jindagi se jude kai aise pahaluon par prakaash daalaa gaya he jisase hindi kaa pathakvarg anjaan rahaa hoga
 The more interesting to know about Swamiji's childhood, the more interesting is the story of his meeting with Ramakrishna Paramahamsa which binds the reader
 pustak ke pehle adhyay main vivekanand ke bachapan se pathak rubaru hota he or jaanata he ki kaise unka bachapan anya bacchon kii hi tarah saamaanya hote hue bhi alag tha
 The second chapter is even more interesting, describing how Vivekananda got introduced to his guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 jaise-jaise guru shishy kaa sambandh aage badhata he, pustak or bhi rochak hoti jaati he
 How is it possible to mention Swami Vivekananda and not to mention the Dharma Mahasabha held in Chicago in 1893? is pustak main mahasabha ke saath hi swamiji kii america yatra kaa vivaran unki hi jubaani kuch is tarah pesh kiya gaya he ki pathak khud ko usase judaa mahasoos karenge
 For example, what was his state of mind in America, there was a time when he was almost going to run out of money abroad, what was he thinking at that time, etc
 pustak ke kuch rochak ansh
 
 
 When Swami Vivekananda met his Guru Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa for the first time, he asked in the same words, "sir, have you seen God?" He replied as soon as he left, "yes
 jaise main tum logon ko dekh rahaa hum, tum logon se baatcheet kar rahaa hum, thik usee tarah unhen bhi dekha ja saktaa he, unase baaten kii ja sakati hai
 But who wants this? People shed tears in mourning for their wives and sons, but who is impatient for God? If someone calls out to get them, then they definitely give him a vision
 'aise hi kai rochak tathy pathak ko is puri pustak main milte hai or wo bhi khud vivekanand kii jubaani
 So read, get familiar with the miraculous personality of Swami Vivekananda and take advantage of it in your life by taking inspiration from his autobiography

 The autobiography of Swami Vivekananda is also an excellent compilation of Shankar

 The staff made noise and tried to separate the two in many other ways, but they did not succeed and the tiger attacked the tigress vigorously and killed her

 Before Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned from America, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned on social media under the pretext of US Congress
 soshal media par apni vaapasi kii manmohan singh ne bhi kalpana na kii hogi
 What happened during the Prime Minister's speech in the US Congress? The applause of the applause, his critics began to see the old record that what is right is the first clap for anyone
 you tub par manmohan singh ko dhundne lage
 At the end of Prime Minister Modi's speech in the media, more than the speech started saying that eight or nine times American mps stood up and expressed respect, then thirty or thirty three times the collective applause rang
 bhakton ke dwaara har baar aisi harakat ho jaati he jisase pradhanmantri kii videsh yatra kii sari charchaa yaa to tali kii ginati main kho jaati he yaa stadium main sunne aae logon kii sankhya main
 Foreign policy elements are left behind in the speech
 taaliyon or khadey hone par jor padate hi bhakt virdohi you tub par july 2005 kaa video khojane lage
 When former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressed the US Congress
 ek kism kaa muqaabala chal padaa
 For the first time, Manmohan Singh was brought against Modi
 log soshal media par unke bhaashanon ko bhi saajha karne lage hai
 In many feeds, along with the speech of the Prime Minister, the link of Manmohan Singh's speech is also available
 maine bhi is video ko dekha
 In his honor, the mps of US Congress kept clapping for a long time
 is video ko dekhte vakt main ub gaya or laga ki log itani der tak tali kyon baja rahe hai
 As soon as the guest enters, it is understandable to clap for a while, but it seems that the mps have been told that whatever happens, clap for a long time
 sadan main manmohan singh aa gaye hai, bolne ke liye manch par pahunch gaye hai, khadey ho gaye hai or ab bolnaa chaahate hai magar tali he ki baji ja rahi he
 There is no rhyme bas bajaae ja rahe hai
 Perhaps there will be tradition
 kartal dhwani kaa bhi qadamtal kii tarah abhyaas karaayaa jaataa hoga
 However, there was a fight against Manmohan Singh's video
 bhakt or bhakt virodhiyon kaa aacharan ek samaan ho gaya
 The situation became such that absurd comments were made on Prime Minister Modi's English pronunciation
 mazaaq udaaya jane laga ki dekho pradhanmantri telepromptor par likhi angreji padhate hai
 In this context, all English scholar anchors should be dismissed, who for many years read English by looking at the teleprompter under the camera
 ham hindivaale bhi studio main aise hi padhate hai
 If this continues, then this match on social media will kill the public political culture of India
 baharhaal manmohan singh ke saath jawahar laal nehru se lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi tak ke video nikaal liye gaye
 But Manmohan Singh's video got more space in these three
 koi takniki jaankaar bataa saktaa he ki soshal media par pichley 48 ghante main modi kii tulana main manmohan singh kii kya upasthiti rahi
 His video may not be able to beat the video of Prime Minister Modi's speech, but wherever his video is, there is also Manmohan Singh around it
 tippaniyan Even in the newspapers, the speeches of both of them in the US Congress have been compared very well
 iconomik times ne baqayda taul kar bataaya he ki pradhanmantri modi ne manmohan singh kii tulana main 15 pratishat kam shabdon kaa istamaal kiya
 Manmohan Singh did not take the name of his then predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jawaharlal Nehru, while Modi did not take his name as Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 is tarah pehali baar modi ke muqaabale manmohan singh jagah pate nazar aae
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Manmohan Singh flew like a weed in Modi's storm
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi maa bete kii sarkaar bol kar hi zyaada hamalaa kiya
 Very few attacked the former Prime Minister
 us saal janvari main manmohan singh ne ek press conference kiya tha
 This was his third and final press conference in a ten-year program
 tab unhone kaha tha ki "samakaleen media kii tulana main mere prati itihaas zyaada udaar hoga"
 Manmohan Singh ji can smile on his return, but thanks social media will say no to history! And yes this has not happened as a result of generosity but in response to one type of bigotry

 The conduct of devotees and devout opponents became the same
 haalat ye ho gai ki pradhanmantri modi kii angreji ke uccharan par betuki tippaniyan hone lageen
 It started being ridiculed that the Prime Minister read English written on the teleprompter
 is lihaaz se to angrezi ke tamaam vidwaan ankar kaarij ho jaaen jo kai saal se camere ke neeche lage telepromptor par dekh kar angrezi padhate hai
 We Hindi people also study like this in studios
 aisa hi chalata rahaa to soshal media kaa yah match bharat kii saarvajanik raajnneetik samskruti kaa sarvanaash karke dam legaa
 However, videos from Jawaharlal Nehru to Atal Bihari Vajpayee with Manmohan Singh were removed
 magar in teenon main zyaada jagah mili manmohan singh ke video ko
 Any technical expert can tell what presence of Manmohan Singh was on social media compared to Modi in the last 48 hours
 unka video pradhanmantri modi ke bhaashan ke video ko bhale na pachhad paaya ho magar jahaan jahaan unka video he uske aasapaas manmohan singh kaa bhi he
 The comments yahaan tak akhabaaron main bhi america congress main hue donon ke bhaashanon kii khub tulana hui he
 The Economic Times has weighed down that Prime Minister Modi used 15 per cent fewer words than Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh ne apane tatkaaleen purvavarti atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa naam na lekar jawahar laal nehru kaa naam liya to modi ne unka naam na lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa liya
 In this way, for the first time, Manmohan Singh was seen finding a place against Modi
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan modi kii aandhi main manmohan singh khar-patavaar kii tarah ud gaye
 Prime Minister Modi also attacked more by speaking the mother-son government
 purv pradhanmantri par bahut kam hamalaa kiya
