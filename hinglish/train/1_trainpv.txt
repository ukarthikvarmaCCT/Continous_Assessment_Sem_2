 Although it was not so easy
 unhone beintahaa tanaav se guzarate hue paanch karod ke sawaal kaa dabaav mahasoos kiya tha
 Who can know this better than Sushil
 ek galat jawaab, use khaali haath lautaa saktaa tha
 (you can read the question below and the full details at that time) At the time when Amitabh Bachchan asked the question of five crores in the game show, Sushil was also urinating
 usne amitabh se is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 However, he was not allowed to go out as per the rules till the game was over
 sawaal kaa yah dabaav sirf susheel hi nahin vahaan maujuud unki patni, rishtedaar or sho main aae kai duusare logon ke chehre par bhi saafe najar aa rahi thi
 What was that question? The question Amitabh asked for five crores was the 13th and final question of the game show

 Again and again, his uneasiness was evident sitting on the chair
 darasal, unke paas dabl dip or phone friend kii do lifline bachi thi
 There were also substantial dangers in their use

 He used the Phone of Friend Lifeline
 iske liye unhone motihaari (bihar) main shyaam kishor prasad se baatcheet kii
 Amitabh got his lineup with Shyam Kishore on the phone line
 shyaam kishor ko mahaj 30 second ke andar sawaal sunakar jawaab dena tha
 Sushil quickly tried to explain the question
 durbhaagya se vah tay samay main shyaam kishor ko sawaal nahin samajha paae or unki lifline barbaad ho gai
 What did Sushil do after the ruining of the life line? After this, his family members present in the game show lost their faces
 susheel paanch karod jeet paaenge yaa nahin - game sho or tivi set par date logon kii romaanchak dilchaspee kaa vishay ban gaya
 "italy did not come, France did not go" After the third life line was ruined, Sushil himself tried to answer the question
 vah budbuda uthaa- "italy aayaa nahin france baad main gaya
 One of the other two is the answer
 " is dauraan susheel kii pareshaani dekh amitabh ne use game sho bhi chhodane kii salaah di
 By doing this he could go back by winning one crore
 haalanki susheel phir budbudaya
 "italy did not come
 france gaya nahin
 Then both of these remain
 " amitabh ne susheel se phir kaha, "agar aapako yahi lag rahaa he to aap dabl dip khel sakate hai
 "no urine was allowed
 Sushil had to go for urination
 amitabh ne use ijaajat nahin di
 Troubled by the question, Sushil remained silent for a while
 amitabh ne use focus banane kii salaah di
 Feeling under immense pressure, he asked Amitabh to drink water
 phir uthakar glass uthaaya
 He kept repeating the question on the computer screen while drinking water
 haalanki amitabh kii salaah par vah baith gaya
 Sushil then started mumbling, "italy did not come, France did not go
" " uske aisa karte hi sho main maujuud log tahaakaa markar hansane lage
 However, it was a time of immense pressure and trouble for Sushil
 istemaal kii aakiri liflinejab susheel, sawaal ko lekar kisi jawaab tak nahin pahunch paaya to usne dabl dip aajamaane kii baat kahi
 This was her fourth and final lifeline

 Now he will have to play

 Amitabh locks the answer

 aavaran katha: sookhe kii maar The Aam Aadmi Party government on Wednesday unveiled the statue of Maharana Pratap at the Interstate Bus Stand (ISBT) at Delhi's Kashmiri Gate, but the preparations at the bus station raised many questions

 The order stated that noise pollution in ISBT has reached a dangerous situation and concrete steps need to be taken immediately to stop it
 magar iske ulat aaj aiesabiti main ek alag hi tasviir dekhne mili
 While Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Kailash Gehlot were garlanding the statue of Maharana Pratap on the one hand, the noise of the drum drums suppressed the sound of that Delhi government's order of noise pollution
 jab parivahan mantrikailash gahalotise is babat sawaal poocha to unhone kaha, "wo aadesh gadiyon kii honking ke liye tha
 Now the man will not stop the conversation for fear of noise pollution

 kashmir main hurriyat conference ke tamaam netaa kis tarah pakistan se karodon rupye lekar kashmir main hinsa failaane main lage hai, aaj tak or india today par iske khulaase ke baad chaaron taraf tikhi pratikriya dekhne ko mili hai
 Even leaders who have advocated to involve the Hurriyat in the talks on the Kashmir problem are in a hurry after this report
 left party ke netaa is baat kii purajor vakaalat karte rahe hai ki kashmir ko lekar sarkaar ko baatcheet kaa silsilaa aage badhanaa chahie or vahaan kii tamaam partiyon samet hurriyat conference ko baatcheet main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 What did Vrinda say on Aaj Tak's disclosure? To this day and when asked by India Today, the sting of Hurriyat leaders, CPM leader Vrinda Karat also said that what is being shown in the report is very shocking and quite frivolous
 
 unhone maang kii ki sarkaar ko fouran is maamle main jaanch karaani chahie or jo kuch camere par dikhne vaali baaten sach hai to in logon ke khilaaf sarkaar ko karrwai kerani chahie
 Vrinda Karat said that till date and the India Today report is eye-opening but this does not mean that the way of dialogue with the people of Kashmir should be closed
 unka kahana tha ki hurriyat ke kuch netaa pakistan se or hafiz said se madad lekar bhale hi hinsa bhadkaa rahe ho lekin baatcheet kaa rasta band karne se kashmir samasya kaa hal nahin nikalegaa
 Here, let us tell you that till date the report showed how Hurriyat leaders in Kashmir are openly saying that they are spreading violence in Kashmir Valley by taking hundreds of crores of rupees from Pakistan and even schools and hospitals Are burning hurriyat ke netaa yahaan tak kah rahe hai ki aatankwaadi hafiz said bhi kashmir main hinsa bhadakaane ke liye paise bhejtaa he
 As a reaction to this video, Vrinda Karat says that what has been shown in Aaj Tak's report proves more well that the Modi government's policies on Kashmir have failed badly
 usee kaa nateeja yah he ki pakistan ko kashmir main apana prabhaav badhaane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 Brinda Karat said that the left parties have been continuously saying that instead of talking to the people of Kashmir, it is not going to solve them by firing bullets or crushing them with force
 gauratlab he ki janvari ke maheene main bijepi ke netaa or purv videsh mantri yashavanth sinha kii aguwai main 5 logon kaa ek dal kashmir gaya tha or kashmir samasya ko sulajhane ke liye apni taraf se pahal kii thi
 Yashwant Sinha and the people accompanying him had strongly advocated that Hurriyat leaders should be included in any dialogue on Kashmir after several rounds of travel in Kashmir and after talking to other parties, including all Hurriyat leaders
 needed
 lekin ajtak kii report ke baad inlogon kii bolti band he or inamen se yashavanth sinha samet sabhi log is bare main puche jane par kisi na kisi bahaane se baatcheet karne se bachate rahen or ajtak ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 The US Ketrump administration has said that India's deal of billions of dollars of the KS-400 missile defense system will be considered a 'critical transaction' and will be processed under the Countering America Adversary Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA, KATSA)
 is babat america raashtrapatidonald trampane ek kaaryakari aadesh par dastakhat bhi kar diya he
 The order has put a freeze on China's equipment development department (EDD) and its director Li Shangfu as the company procured Russia's ssukhoesu-35 fighter jet and S-400 surface-to-air missile
 trump prashasan ke is aadesh ke baad america adhikaar kshetra main ididi or shangaphu kii sari sampattiyon par taala lag jayega
 Also, US citizens will not be able to do any transaction with this company
 ek america adhikari ne pitiai ko bataaya, 'ham yah bataanaa chaahate hai ki kisi company ke saath lenden kaa america main ek vidhaayi maanak he
 The US has taken this step because in December 2017 after the implementation of CAATSA, China purchased 10 Sukhoi fighter aircraft, especially the SU-25S
 iske saath hi china ne is saal janvari main es-400 missile system (jise ese-21 bhi kaha jaataa he) or isse jude aujaar kharide
 'the official further said, China had signed both these deals with Russia when USA had implemented
 missile system kii deal chini company ididi or rogebarnexport ke bich hui jo rus kii hathiyaar niryaatak company he
 The official said that the main objective of this ban on China was to ban Russia
 adhikari ne kaha, kisi desh kii raksha kshamtaaon par roak lagane kii niyat se katsa nahin lagaaya gaya he balki rus kii galat gatividhiyon par rokane ke liye aisa kiya gaya
 "this is the first time the US has taken action under Section 231 of KATSA," the official said
 ' adhikari ne is sawaal par jawaab nahin diya ki turki ne bhi es-400 missile system kharida he, to kya uske khilaaf bhi america karrwai karegaa
 "there is no decision now on the purchase of other countries, but we have seriously considered those countries which have purchased S-400 and Sukhoi or intend to make any further deal," the official said
 trump prashasan ne spasht kar diya he ki jo desh es-400 missile system kharidne kii taiyaari main hai, unke khilaaf katsa ke tahat karrwai par vichaar kiya jayega

 dilli hai court ne tripal talaak ko lekar lagaai gai yachika ko kaarij kar diya he
 The court has told the petitioner that whether women are Hindu or Muslim, everyone has equal rights in the country and the Supreme Court is hearing on May 8 for triple talaq, but there is no need to hear it in the High Court
 saath hi court ne yachikakarta ko kaha ki is janhit yachika main hamen koi public interest najar nahin aa rahaa he or is mudde ko supreme court pehle hi sun rahaa he, lihaaza ham is yachika par sunwaayee nahin karnaa chaahate or ise khaarij kar rahe hai
 a separate petition was filed in the Delhi High Court regarding triple talaq
 ye yachika hindu ladki kii muslim ladke se shaadi ke masale ko lekar daayar kii gai
 The petition said that the Muslim husband should not be given the right of triple divorce after marriage between a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy
 yachika me is maang ke kai gambhir kaaran bhi bataaye gaye
 The petition claimed that when a Hindu girl marries a Muslim, the nikahnama that is made is in Urdu and the girl is not informed about the triple divorce and the polygamy of the Muslim boy
 yachikakarta ne yachika main kai udhaaharan bhi die or daawa kiya ki kai hindu ladakiyon ne unhen intercast marij karne ke baad sampark kiya he
 Victim girls say that they are at risk of triple divorce by marrying Muslim boys and many have been divorced, after which she is neither able to stay at Muslim husband's house nor after marrying Muslim She is able to return to her maternal home
 yachika main guhaar lagaai gai thi ki intercast marij ke maamle main agar ladki hindu he to aisi haalat me tripal talaak or muslim pati ke bahuvivaah ko galat tehraaya jaae
 Also, registration of marriage should be made mandatory in case of intercast marriage
 yachika me kaha gaya he ki tripal talaak se peedit mahilaon ne you to supreme court main yachika lagaai hui he, lekin supreme court ke saamne keval muslim mahilaon kaa maamla he
 Hence Hindu women are also affected by triple talaq
 unako lekar koi yachika ab tak na hi lagaai gai he or na hi suni gai he

 unhone kaha ki hamaari taraf se aise koi aadesh nahin die gaye the
 On the other hand, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that we stand on our old statement
 ham aaropon kii jaanch karavaaenge
 The video surfaced soon after DIG Laushali called the newspaper report as beyond facts, but keeping up with his news, the English newspaper immediately uploaded a video of his program on the internet and presented the evidence
 abhi tak is maamle par coast guard or raksha mantralay se lekar khud raksha mantri manohar parrikar kii ore se jo theory pesh kii ja rahi thi uske mutabik boat par savaar sandigdh aatankiyon ne saboot mitaane ke liye khud boat main aag lagaai thi
 Parrikar also raised the possibility among the media that the so-called terrorists on the boat had drunk cyanide and then set the boat on fire
 baad main yah khabar bhi saamne ai ki blast ke kai dinon tak boat se signal milte rahe
 'set the boat on fire

 i was in Gandhinagar that day and i had said that night, fire the boat
 
 
 ham unhen biryani nahin parosna chaahate
 Loshal made this disclosure during the launch of the Coast Guard Interceptor Boat ICGS C-421 in Surat
 is kaarykram main coast guard diaiji sudhir saini or dipti commandent ji sethi maujuud the
 DIG Laushali is the Chief of Staff of the Coast Guard (north-west)
 DIG kaa inkaar, kaha akhbaar kii report jhuthicost guard diaiji bike loshaali ne in khabaron ko jhootha qaraar dete hue kaha he ki unhone boat udaane ke koi aadesh nahin die the
 a statement issued by Laushali said that the newspaper report is not based on facts
 unhone kaha, 'kaarykram ke dauraan maine kaha tha ki rashtravirohi tatwon ko biryani khilaane kii jarurat nahin, unpar kanoonee karrwai honi chahie
 According to the letter, the Coast Guard commander (north-west) was handling the operation, not Laushali
 ham apane bayaan par kaayam hai: parrickrbot cese main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha ki ham apane purv main die gaye bayaan par kaayam hai
 The Coast Guard DIG has denied the news
 ham isaki jaanch karavaaenge or yadi kuch galat paaya gaya to ham karrwai karne se bhi nahin chukenge
 Parrikar also gave indications of disciplinary action on DIG
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko ames ke dikshant samaaroh ko sambodhit kiya
 During this, the Prime Minister appeared in a mild mood
 unhone suzav diya ki garib tabakon ke bacchon ko aise kaaryakramon main vishesh mehmaan ke rup main bulaayaa janaa chahie, taaki unhen protsaahan mili
 Apart from this, what the Prime Minister said, read in his own words: Prime Minister Modi's address in AIIMS i have never been a good student
 na hi kabhi aword nahin mila
 Therefore, no nuances are known
 chaatr jab exam detaa he, to khaanaa bhi nahin jamata
 Stays under great stress
 magar aaj to aap un sabase paar aa pahunche hai, to phir aap itane gambhir kyon hai?(taaliyaan)main kab se dekh rahaa tha
 What is the reason
 kya mishra ji, kya kaaran he?main aapse aagrah karuunga ki aap apane daayitv ke prati isse bhi zyada gambhir hon
 But don't make life serious
 (taaliyaan)jivan mushkil he
 Walking through crises and making a habit of moving forward
 iskaa anand hi alag he
 If we look at the scriptures
 to taittarey upanishad main vedakaal main guru shishy parampara thi or shishy jab vidhyaarthee kaal samaapt kar jaataa tha to kaise canvocation jaataa tha, iskaa usamen zikr he
 That tradition is still going on with a new look
 meraa ek do suzav jarur he
 Can we ever start the tradition of a special guest in this convocation? garib basti main jo skool hai
 30-40 children of one such selected 8th and 9th class should be called here and placed
 or wo dekhen ki ye duniya kya he
 The teacher may not be able to do that work
 us balak ke man main ghante dedh ghante kaa ye avasar ek jigyaasa paidaa karegaa
 Will awaken dreams in the mind
 use lagegaa ki kabhi meri jindagi main ye avasar aae
 Imagine how big an impact this can have
 cheez bahut choti he
 But the strength is very deep
 or yahi chijen hai jo badlaav laati hai
 And i insist that those poor children
 doctor kaa baccha aayega to kahegaa ki mere pitaaji ne bhi kiya he
 How can society make a change in life from its normal things
 us par ham sochen
 Those who are going to become doctors today
 aapane uplabdhi hasil kii he
 Are coming today beete kal or aane vaale kal main kitna antar he
 When you first stepped into AIIMS
 ghar main maa-pita chachaa ne bahut suchanaaen di hongi
 Do this, do not do this
 train main baithe honge to khidki ke baahar mat dekhnaa
 In a way, today is the same moment
 canvocation ek prakaar se aakhri kadam rakhte samay paraamarsh dene kaa ek pal hota he
 Have you ever thought ki jab aap classroom main the, institute main the, pard rahe the, tab aap kitne protected the, koi kathinaayee ai to senior saathi mil jaataa tha, samaadhaan nahin hua to professor, vah nahin mili to dean mil jate the
 By now you must have decided to decide in a safe environment
 lekin ab eklavya kii tarah ekant sadhana kerani hogi
 But if you think going from closed classrooms to huge classrooms
 hameshaa student bane rahen
 The senior people i honored would be aware of the latest medical development
 isliye nahin ki ve marij dekhte hai
 Because the student inside them is alive
 agar ye soch hogi ki institute kii padhai puri to vidhyaarthee jivan puraa, to ye tehraav laaegi
 The moment we stop learning, the first step towards death takes place
 log kah rahe the ki achraj he modi ji kii energy kaa
 Just add that the desire to do something new doesn't make you tired
 aap akasar marij se kehete hai ki ye khaanaa chahie, ye nahin khaanaa chahie
 But as soon as they arrive in the mess, there will be competition
 dekhte hai aaj koun kitne special dish nipataata he
 This is life, friends
 aapane apni aatma ko kabhi poocha
 The patient had said this and i am doing this
 vidhyaarthee jivan main to thik he
 But not now
 main cancer kaa doctor hum or shaam ko dhuandhar cigarette jalaata hum to kya fark padegaa
 People will give your example that your doctor smokes a lot of cigarettes, drinking it does not matter
 ek doctor kaa jivan peshant kii jindagi, uski prerana ban saktaa he
 Think carefully kam log hai, jo jivan ko is rup main dekhte hai
 Was your professor good? ames kii imaarat acchhee thi, aap thodaa mehnatee the, isliye aaj ye din aayaa
 If we think like this then the attitude of looking at life will not lead us to perfection
 exam main raat padhate padhate thand lagi hogi
 Must have come down
 chywala baitha hoga
 On a cold night, the tea-maker would be sleeping under the pillow
 aapane usase kaha hoga, raat bhar padhanaa he
 Dude, drink tea
 usne bina munh banaae kahin se doodh laakar chaay banaai hogi
 Then the success of your life must have started
 kahin der ho rahi hogi jane main, auto vaale ne vakt se pahunchaaya hoga
 Sometimes a peon may have told, no sir, a syringe can be easily installed
 kitne kitne log honge, jinhone aapaki jindagi ko banaaya hoga
 In a way, you are getting a loan
 ye thik bhi tha
 But now you have the responsibility to repay the debt
 kahaan se milin aapako suvidhaayen
 The budget of a bus of a village, the budget of a school in a backward area must have been diverted here
 kisi or kaa haq aapako
 So that doctors get the best facilities
 ye anivaary rahaa hoga
 Because the country needs you
 magar ye bhi aapako yaad rakhana chahie ki samaaj ne kitna kuch diya he
 Always remember that every person who came before me must have contributed something, then i have reached here
 mujh par uskaa adhikaar he
 i do not know whether this thing will reach those who have gone abroad after studying here
 ham nahin chaahate koi pichhadepan main rahe
 Sometimes we also go on holiday with colleagues
 marij tab bhi hote hai
 But this breaks
 kabhi aisa bhi brake rahe ki ham doctor saathi paanch chah din jangalon main, pichde gaanvon main jaaen or vahaan marijon kaa ilaaj karen
 Recommend them a healthy life
 pehle gaanv main ek vaidyaraj hote the or gaanv swasth hota tha
 Today the eye doctor is different
 kaan kaa alag he
 Even the day is not far when the doctor with the left eye will be one
 daanyi aankh kaa doosraa hoga
 But even after so many doctors, there are question marks on people's health
 technolji itani bad rahi he
 You tell me, the robot will do the operation
 programing hogi
 Whatever is to be pruned will do
 baad main para medical staff dekhtaa rahegaa
 i am not scaring you
 itani teji se badlaav aa rahaa he
 In olden times, the aura was behind the picture of the sages
 hamen lagata tha ki acchhee digining ke liye karte honge
 But today Science says that Aura can be important for medical science
 aura science medical science se abhi puri tarah nahin judaa he
 But scientists are working on it
 agar isaki sweekruti ho gai to kranti aa jaaegi
 We are not afraid of revolution
 lekin chintaa ye honi chahie ki ham isse mail baitha rahe hai ki nahin
 Somewhere we are not stuck even with old clothes
 aisa rahaa to badlaav nahin aa saktaa he
 We have to remain relevent
 iske liye prayaas karenge to bahut badi seva kar sakate hai
 You are a student of an institution that has maintained a trade mark in India
 aaj desh main kahin bhi acha aspataal bananaa ho to log kya kehete hai
 Hey brother, make an AIIMS with us
 unhen bas itnaa pataa he ki ames ban jaae to chijen behatar ho jaaen
 Think how lucky you are
 peshant chahta he yahaan bhartee ho jaae
 Student wants admission here
 ames ne desh or duniya main apni jagah banaai he
 You are taking great fortune
 mujhe ummid he ki swasth bharat ke sapane ko puraa karne ke liye bharat mata kii santan ke rup main aap apana sab kuch denge
 Greetings to all from the heart
 main aapkaa saathi hum
 If you have any suggestions, then please let me know
 ham achche raste par jane kii koshish karenge
 i got an opportunity to come among you
 jane kyon mila
 i am not a good patient
 bhagwaan na karen kabhi banuun
 i am not a doctor at all
 isliye bulaayaa ki piem hum
 The country is unfortunate that we go everywhere
 khayr
 Got an opportunity
 abhaari hum
 Thank you

 Kashthabhanjan Hanuman, who resides at Sarangpur in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, rules here in the name of Maharajadhiraj
 ve sone ke singhaasana par virajkar apane bhakton kii har muraad puri karte hai
 It is said that at this rate of Bajrang Bali, every misery of the devotees, their suffering is cured
 phir chaahe baat buree najar kii ho yaa shani ke prakope se mukti kii
 Hanuman swallowed Suryadev in his hair form
 unhone rakshason kaa vadh kiya or lakshmana ke pranadata bhi bane
 From time to time, Bajrang Bali removed the gods from many crises
 pavanputra aaj bhi apane is dham main bhakton ke ksht har lete hai, isliye unhen kshtbhanjan hanuman kehete hai
 At this rate of Hanuman, every suffering is overcome
 yahaan aakar har manokamana puri hoti he
 There is a beautiful and miraculous temple of Kachthanjan in the middle of a building made like a huge and magnificent fort
 kesarinandan ke bhavy mandiron main se ek kshtbhanjan hanuman mandir bhi he
 This is the divine abode of Kishthanjan Hanuman, about 175 kilometers from Ahmedabad to Bhavnagar in Gujarat
 kisi raaj darbar kii tarah saje is sundar mandir ke vishaal or bhavy mandap ke bich 45 kilo sona or 95 kilo chaandi se bane ek sundar singhaasana par hanuman virajte hai
 He has a crown of diamond jewels on his head and also has a gold mace nearby
 sankatmochan ke chaaron ore priy vaanron kii sena dikhti he or unke pairon shanidevji maharaj hai, jo sankatmochan ke is rup ko khaas bana dete hai
 Devotees have unwavering faith in this form of Bajrang Bali and they are drawn from far and wide
 manyata he ki pavanputra kaa swarna aabhushanon se ladaa hua aisa bhavy or durlabh rup kahin or dekhne ko nahin miltaa he
 This statue of Hanumat Lala is very ancient, so the power of Anjaniputra in this form is unique
 do baar he aarti kaa vidhankshtabhajan hanuman ke is mandir main do baar aarti kaa vidhaan he, pehali aarti subah 5
 It is 30 o'clock
 aarti se pehle pavanputra kaa raatri shringaar utaara jaataa he phir nae vastra pahanaakar swarna aabhushanon se unka bhavy shringaar kiya jaataa he or iske baad veda mantron or hanuman chalisa ke paath ke bich sampann hoti he hanuman lalaa kii yah aarti
 Although this temple of Bajrang Bali remains popular daily, but on Tuesday and Saturday lakhs of devotees come here
 nariyal, pushp or mithai kaa prasad kesarinandan ko bhent kar prarthana karte hai
 Some devotees come here only to get rid of Saturn's wrath because they know that they are afraid of Shani Dev but if Shani Dev is afraid of someone then he himself is Sankatmochan Hanuman
 kshtbhajan hanuman kii mangalvaar or shanivaar ko vishesh aradhana hoti he
 Devotees come here with a desire to remove their sufferings and bad eyesight and get rid of their sufferings by having the temple priest worship Bajrang Bali
 kya he is dham kii visheshatabajrang bali ke is dham ko unke anya mandiron se alag vishesh sthaan dilaati he unke pairon main virajman shani kii murti
 Because Shani is seen here in the female form at the feet of Bajrang Bali
 tabhi to jo bhakt shani prakopon se pareshaan hote hai ve yahaan aakar nariyal chadhaakar samast chintaaon se mukti paa jate hai
 You may want to know why Shanidev had to take the female form and why he is at the feet of Bajrang Bali
 kehete hai kareeb 200 saal pehle bhagwaan swami narayan is sthaan par satsang kar rahe the
 Swami became so absorbed in the devotion of Bajrang Bali that he saw the divine form of Hanuman that led to the construction of this temple
 baad main swami narayan ke bhakt gopalanand swami ne yahaan is sundar pratimaa kii sthapana kii
 It is said that there was a time when the whole kingdom of Shani Dev was in terror, people were plagued by the atrocities of Shani Dev
 aakhirkaar bhakton ne apni fariyaad bajrang bali ke darbar main lagaai
 Hearing the talk of the devotees, Hanuman ji followed him to kill Shani Dev
 ab shanidev ke paas jaan bachaane kaa aakhri vikalp baaki tha so unhone stri rup dhaaran kar liya
 Because he knew that Hanuman ji is a child celibate and he will not raise his hands on any woman
 aisa hi hua, pavanputra ne shanidev ko maarane se inkaar kar diya
 But Lord Rama ordered them, then Hanumanji crushed the female form Shani Dev under his feet and freed the devotees from the tyranny of Shani Dev
 manyata he bajrang bali ke isi rup ne shani ke prakope se mukt kiya
 Therefore, all the wrath of Shani is overcome immediately by the worship done here, only then devotees from far and wide come here and get liberation from the condition of Shani
 kyonki bhakton kaa aisa vishwaas he ki kesarinandan ke is rup main 33 koti devi devataaon kii shakti samahit he
 People have immense reverence for this Hanuman temple
 kyonki yahaan bhakton ko bajrang bali ke saath shani dev kaa aashirwad bhi mil jaataa he
 It is said that if a devotee offers coconut and says his wish, then his bag is never empty
 shani dasha se mukti to milti hi he saath hi sankatmochan kaa raksha kavach bhi mil jaataa he

 As Karl Jung states, "recognizing the relative nature of one's evil is within the realm of the possibilities of man, but looking at the face of extreme evil is a frightening and shocking experience for him
" ''isi roshni main hamen bhartiya janata party ke 'gandhi sankalp yatra' nikaalane ke faisle ko dekhne kii jarurat he, jo ''swatchta, ahimsa, swadeshi, swaraj or saadagi'' ke unke vichaaron kaa prachaar-prasar karne ke liye unki jayanti 2 aktubar se nikaali jaaegi
 Note that this list does not contain communal harmony or hindu-muslim unity, nor does it talk of fighting against caste discrimination, which were the two main features of Gandhi's social and political program
 alpsankhyakon ke adhikaron kii raksha ko shaamil karne kii to ummid hi bekaar he, jo swatantra bharat ke banane ke shuruaati maheenon main gandhi ke liye gahari aasthaa kii baat thi
 Gandhi's assassination was ultimately due to his insistence on giving equal political status to a small number of Muslim and Christian communities and even non-hindus
 bhaajapa ke nae netritv ke haathon gandhi ko apnaane yaa hadapney ke aakraamak kadam ko lekar logon ne hairaani jataai he
 Is the party changing? The Prime Minister's announcement from the Red Fort to make the cleanliness campaign his flag bearer program surprised even those who believed that the leader who made his career by abusing Muslims and dividing people to become a politician after gaining power Is looking forward to unhone unhen samajhane kii vakaalat kii
 Six years showed that even the memory of Gandhi's memory could not change bjp's politics
 yah pehali baar nahin he jab bhaajapa or uski matra sanstha aresas gandhi ke saath lila rach rahe hai
 The RSS included Gandhi in its morning memorial list only after his assassination
 aisa karnaa isliye jaruri tha kyonki use gandhi kii jaan lene vaali hinsa main sahabhaagi ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 The BJP adopted the slogan 'gandhian Socialism' under Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 baad main usne is mile ke pathar ko to chupchaap ek taraf kinare kar diya, lekin vakt-vakt par vah gandhi ke paas lautakar aati rahi
 The aggression by which the BJP is trying to usurp Gandhi under Modi is new, but it is in keeping with the spirit of this rule
 isse zyada bemail jode kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 The only common thing in both seems to be Hindu, which the RSS claims to represent
 magar yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki hindu dharm se uskaa naata upyogetavaadi he, aasthaa kii baat nahin
 Nor does he make any spiritual pretenses
 yah satta hasil karne or use apni mutthi main rakhane kaa bilkul secular, duniyavi aujaar he
 Hinduism is a demographic consideration for the RSS and BJP, which helps it mobilize the majority of people who consider themselves Hindu
 gandhi ke liye yah behad nijee cheez thi, rajnatik satta ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali cheez katai nahin
 The Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Gita are historical documents for the RSS and the BJP; They are poetic for Gandhi! The RSS and its allies would demolish the mosque to 'reclaim' the exact birthplace of Rama; Ram was not a historical figure for Gandhi at all
 in maamalon main unki spashtataa chaunkaane vaali he
 When Rajendra Prasad told him about the demand for a legal ban on cow slaughter, he categorically refused, because there are people in India for whom eating beef is not prohibited
 aresas ke liye bharat mukhyat: hinduon kii dharti he
 Muslims and others are considered to be later or outsiders on this earth, who have to accept Hindu way of living
 gandhi ke liye yah asweekaarya tha
 He told the students in his 'creative program', "you will not force others to sing Vande Mataram or even hoist the national flag
" ''to, gandhi vah sab kuch the jiske aresas khilaaf he
 Then why does the RSS try to claim Gandhi's company? In my opinion, the only thing is that he wants to create equality between the two
 vah gandhi ko raashtra nirmaataaon ke devkul main oonche asana se neeche utarkar apane str par laana chahta he
 The claim of attachment and appreciation between the two is concocted and silent, but it is necessary for the RSS to carry it forward
 yah uske kaaryakartaaon ko hinata granthi se nijaat dilaane main madad karata he—us hinata granthi se, jisase ve gandhi ke saamne hameshaa grast rahete hai
 Gandhi is deeply ingrained in the Indian public and his stature needs to be shortened
 bhaajapa gandhi ko apana banane ke liye isliye bhi aatur he kyonki vah bharat-vichaar ko paribhaashit karne vaali party ke taur par dikhaai dena chaahati he
 But as Ali Khan Mahmudabad writes, "the source of this idea lies in the freedom struggle and the constitution
 bhaajapa ke paas aise koi purvaj yaa vanshavali nahin he jo is vichaar kii uski milkiyat ko vishwasaneey bana de, lihaaja uske liye sarvyaapee gandhi or samvidhan nirmaataa ambedkar ko hadapna jaruri ho gaya he
 And Bhagat Singh for fighting
 ''udhar gandhi ke khilaaf ninda kaa abhiyaan bheetar hi bheetar abaadh jari he
 This is in line with the dual character of RSS and BJP

 Or did he get the vote because of his exact attitude? However, it is true that the secular parties too did not imitate Gandhi's views, his political conduct and he was transformed into a mere ceremonial presence in our collective life
 hamaare skulon or jan samskruti ne bhi gandhi ko bematlab bana diya he
 He has been made a lifestyle guru, feelgood presence - something he was never
 ve taumr lokapriy vishwaason ko chunauti dete rahe or logon ko apane ravaiyon par dobaaraa sochane ke liye majaboor karte rahe
 Even then he was converted into a saint who had no worldly concerns
 rajnatik gandhi ko to hamaare rajnatik tabake ne bahut pehle hi tilanjali de di thi
 Non-violent Gandhi was a threatening presence not only for the British but also for many compatriots
 ab hamaare saamne jis ahimsak gandhi ko pesh kiya jaataa he, ve gaiyr-asahmat gandhi hai jo rajya kii tamaam hinsa ko sweekaar kar lete hai
 Gandhi can be freed from the clutches of this hostile majoritarianism only when his politics is revived
 yah asahmati kii raajnneeti he, jo maanviya saahas ke saath kii jaati he, or jise kabhi-kabhi khud apane logon ke khilaaf janaa hota he
 If we are not ready to walk this path, then there is no point in mourning Gandhi's capture at the hands of BJP and RSS

 The lawyers put up posters by asking Rao to clear whether he was a lawyer or a retired police officer
 tees hajaari court main vakil or police birdari ke bich hui hinsake baad donon guton main tanaav ke bich vakil chaahate hai ki alen raav yah saaf karen ki police or vakeelon ke jhagade main wo kiske saath khadey hai
 In the debates on TV channels, former police officer Rao was seen favoring the police, to which the lawyers have strong objection
 pichley hafte dilli main vakeelon or police ke bich hui hinsa ke baad jari vivaad ke baad ab court kii prakriya waapas behaal kii ja rahi he
 Even though there is no formal agreement between the police and the lawyers yet, people have started coming back to the courts
 aaj guuruuvaar ko saket court ke get janata ke liye khol die gaye hai
 The public coming to the court was welcomed with white flowers
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki hamaari hadtaal shantipurna tareeke se ho rahi he
 Proxy councils have been placed in the court which will appear in the court
 cese vahi dekhenge, vakil court nahin jaaenge
 We do not have a fight with the public, so they are welcome
 vakeelon kii hadtaal jareeis bich vakeelon kii hadtaal aaj bhi jari he
 The lawyers started mobilizing in Saket court since morning

 Lawyers say that the media is defaming them
 is masale par supreme court ne sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya
 However, the impact of a clash between lawyers and police in Delhi is visible in other states
 rajasthan or maharashtra main bhi vakeelon ne pradarshan kiya

 'vote for Congress with a stone on the heart' Talking to the media on Wednesday, Mayawati said that the people of these three states were saddened by bjp's misdeeds, that is why they did not want to see BJP coming back in the elections

 Parties like bjp-congress do not want our party to succeed

 In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP is still engaged in manipulations, the BSP will support the Congress even if it does not agree with the Congress policies to prevent it
 taaki bijepi rajya main sarkaar naa bana paae
 Even in Rajasthan, if the Congress needs support to form the government, the BSP will support it there

 rajasthan ke chunavi raajnneeti mencongressorabijepico chhodkar kabhi bhi kisi tisare dal kii koi ahmiyat nahin rahi he
 But this time, both Congress and BJP are restless seeing the way the independent MLA Hanuman Beniwalki is crowding the meetings
 darasal, nirdaleey vidhayak hanuman beniwal ne yah ghoshnaa kar rakhi he ki 29 oktober ko jaipur main aakrosh raily kar tisare morche kaa elaan karenge
 Hanuman Beniwal is on a fast-track tour across Rajasthan for the rally to be held at Mansarovar, Jaipur
 hanuman beniwal ko dekhne or sunne waalon kii baari bheed choti-choti sabhaaon main umad rahi he
 Beniwal has uneasiness in both Congress and BJP, seeing the public coming to the meetings of Jat vote bank Hanuman Beniwal
 hanuman beniwal ne ab tak rajasthan ke sabhi bade sambhaagon main badi-badi reliyaan kii hai
 Now, after announcing the new party, it has decided to enter the Third Front constitution assembly elections
 tisare morche ke liye beniwal bahujan samaaj party or bijepi se bijepi ke vidhayak rahe ghanashyam tiwari kii dinadayal vahini se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 It is believed that Beniwal has a large base of Jat votes through which he can make a dent in the vote bank of Congress and BJP
 kai siton par bigaad sakate hai khelnagaur ke ilaake se aane vaale beniwal ke shekhavati or marwar main bhi acchhee khaasi pakad he
 If the Brahmin vote bank and Bahujan Samaj Party's Scheduled Caste vote bank come together with Ghanshyam Tiwari, Hanuman Beniwal can spoil the game of both BJP and Congress in many seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki barmer ke ilaake main maanavendra singh ke congress main aane ke baad bijepi jaaton par najar gadaaye hue he lekin beniwal ne vahaan apni acchhee pakad bana lee he
 In such a situation, if the candidates of Beniwal stand there, then the BJP will suffer
 jabaki shekhavati ke ilaake main jat ek baar phir se badi sankhya main congress se jude hai
 BSP and Beniwal's alliance in Shekhawati losses Congress, if Bahujan Samaj Party and Beniwal's Jat vote bank combine in Shekhawati will be a big loss for Congress
 haalanki, yah bhi sach he ki bijepi or congress donon hanuman beniwal par bijepi or congress kii meeting hone kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot says that both Hanuman Beniwal and Ghanshyamatwadi have been BJP leaders and if they contest elections, only BJP will suffer

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan and his ministers are only having dreams of Kashmir day and night

 Akram said that 'politics and sports should be kept separate from each other
 bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa match, england or australia ke bich ashes siries se kahin adhik romaanchak hota he
 Akram, who took 502 wickets in 356 odis in his career, said that the Ashes series is watched by nearly two crore people, but any match played between India and Pakistan is viewed by Arab people

 manoj jha ne kaha ki bhakpa-rajd ke bich gathbandhan nahin ho saktaa tha kyonki rajd apane ummidavaar tanwir hasan kii begusarai main lokapriyata or unke dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ke maddenjar koi samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin thi
 He said that RJD has been a very strong force
 2014 ke chunaavon main tathakthith modi lahar main bhi hamaare ummidavaar ko lagbhag chaar lakh vot mili the or tab se unhone begusarai kabhi nahin choda
 It was impossible for us to ignore Tanvir Hasan's candidature
 hamaara kader majboot he jo tanwir hasan ko chahta tha
 There is nothing we cannot do
 sabakuch hamaare kaaryakartaaon, logon par nirbhar he
 Therefore, making someone else a candidate in his place was the reason for not being aligned
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main hasan lagbhag 55,000 maton ke antar se bhaajapa ke bholaa singh se harkar duusare sthaan par rahe the
 Rajendra Singh of CPI about 1
 92 lakh voton ke saath tisare sthaan par rahe the
 Significantly, according to sources in the cpi's Bihar unit, there was discontent over nominating Kanhaiya Kumar in a section of party leaders and forging a compromise on the alliance
 rajdroh maamle ke samay kanhaiya ke kareebi rahe lekin baad main jeenyu main rajd ke chaatrasangh kii sthapana main shaamil hone vaale jayant jigyaasu ne kaha ki yah "kanhaiya kumaar ke ahankaar or agyanta kaa kaaran tha jo gathbandhan nahin hua
 Kanhaiya, however, did not comment on the non-alliance even after repeated phone calls
 gauratlab he ki rajd kii taraf se kanhaiya kumaar ko apana ummidavaar na banane ke baad bhakpa ne unhen apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 BJP has fielded Union Minister Giriraj Singh against him
 jabaki rajd ne tanwir hasan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 Now the contest on this seat has become quite interesting

 When he was younger, he used to go to the fields
 aam ke ped par pake hue aamon ko khaanaa mujhe zyada pasand tha
 Not like ripe mangoes, ripe mangoes are preferred
 ' piem modi ne apane jivan ke har pahalu par baatcheet kii he, chaliye padhaten hai silsilewar tareeke se

 How do Indian spinners perform against England and how do Indian batsmen face the best of England spinners
 viraat kohli kehete hai, 'hamane rajkot main jo bhi siikhaa uskaa istemaal ham agle 10-12 saal kar sakenge

 With the help of the 'modi wave', the BJP was able to return to power with a majority in the country, and then successive victories in the states are being hoisted
 desh hi nahin videsh main bhi modi ke naam kaa danka baj rahaa he or narendra modi ek bade brands banakar ubhare hai
 Due to this brand, BJP has added saffron color to 70 percent of the country
 20 rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet kaa paracham lahraane ke baad narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi ne ek ke baad ek rajya main jeet darj kii
 The political base of the BJP is continuously expanding
 maujuuda samay main desh ke 20 rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 BJP is in power in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Sikkim
 inamen se kai rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he or kai jagah sahyogi dalon ke saath milakar party satta main hissedaar he
 Apart from this, BJP has also made a record of becoming the world's largest party
 modi ke naam-kaam par bijepibijepi modi ke naam or kaam par chunavi samar main utarati or jitati aa rahi he
 Surgical strikes, demonetisation, Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan, GST, Electrification became electoral issues of the party during the Modi government in the post-2014 elections
 bijepi ke poster, parchon, billon se lekar hording or soshal media tak main sirf modi hi modi chhaae rahe
 Barring the defeats of Delhi, Bihar and Punjab, the BJP either got power in the assembly elections of all the states or it remained in a respectable position
 modi banaam puraa vipakshdesh kii raajnneeti main ek daur main congress ke khilaaf jis tarah vipaksh ekajute tha
 On the same lines, all the leaders including Congress President Rahul Gandhi are also trying to unite the opposition against Modi
 isi se modi ke kad kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier such solidarity was seen in opposition against Indira Gandhi
 haal hi main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad vipaksh main ekajutata kii aawaaj or buland hui
 This suggests that there will be a complete opposition versus Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yani 2019 kaa sabase bada chunavi mudda khud modi hi banane vaale hai
 Modi's slogans hit, new trades set and spells the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on people's heads
 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas', 'abaki baar modi sarkaar', desh kaa chaukeedaar, na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa jaisi baaten modi samarthakon kii jubaan par rahati hai
 Modi has set a new formula of social engineering
 unhone alag-alag jaateey samoohon ko apane saath milaayaa or unhen party se lekar sarkaar tak main hissedari di
 Making non-jat in Haryana, non-marathi in Maharashtra and non-tribal in CM in Jharkhand is an example of Modi's political acumen and vision
 modi ke kaayal kai deshon ke rajanetapradhanmantri narendra modi kii badhati lokapriyata ne pichley chaar saalon main bharat kii seemaa laangh videshon main bhi apana asar dikhaaya or unki chhavi ko vishwastareey pahchaan mili he
 Modi has traveled to 54 countries in 36 foreign tours till May 2018 during his four-year reign
 videshi dharti par 'modi-modi' ke naare lagate hai
 Modi has visited America five times in the last four years
 modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main kul 7 deshon ke pramukh hissaa lene aae the jinamein pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif bhi shaamil the
 Apart from this, foreign guests have visited India including politicians from major countries like USA, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and UK

 com / jzf8szdaia The Modi government at the Center has not completed a year yet and the government is about to introduce its second rail budget
 is baar modi sarkaar kaa yah pehla sampurna rail bajet hoga
 But if sources are to be believed, this may also be the last budget presented by the government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main sarkaar to puure paanch saal chalegi, purna bahumat he unke paas
 But the railway budget may not be presented in Parliament from next time
 hindi akhbaar dainik bhaskar ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar di he ki agle saal se centre sarkarel mantralayake bajet ko aam bajet ke tahat hi pesh karegi
 There are many other ministries with more budget than the railway ministry, in which case the government believes that only the budget of the railway ministry should be different
 sarkaar ne rail mantralay ke sabase taqatvar sanghathan chah-sadasyeey railway board ke punargathan ke liye niti ayog ke sadsy vivek debaroy kii adhyakshata main ek samiti bhi bana di he
 The railway ministry is counted among the few ministries of the central government that are making a profit
 guuruuvaar 26 farvari ko pesh hone ja rahe rail bajet main centre sarkaar kaa sabase zyada jor paise jutaney par rahegaa
 Although the Ministry of Railways has assured not to increase fares, despite this, a slight increase in passenger fares of all categories can be announced this time
 railway maal-bhaade ke saath hi jameen, imaaraton or duusare sansadhano ke bhi behatar istemaal se zyada dhan jutaney par dhyaan degaa
 The Railway Ministry currently earns 45 thousand crore rupees only from passenger fares
 iskaa 95 fisadi hissaa general category yaa thri tear sleeper se aata he
 Except AC three tier, railways are suffering in all categories of fares
 asi thri tear kii siten train booking khulne ke paanch-chah ghanton main hi bhar jaati hai
 It may also be announced that 24 to 28 boxes can be installed
 inamen se zyaadaatar dibbe asi thri tear hi honge
 The announcement of higher fares for premium seats in AC Chaircar is also likely
 railway ko maal-bhaade se 90 hajaar karod rupee kii aamadani ho rahi hai
 Freight by rail is still three times cheaper than trucks
 iske baavjood use is mad main sirf 45 hajaar karod kaa laabh he
 That is, there is no scope to run more trains on them
 nai train line bichaane main bada roda bhoomi adhigrahan kaa he, jo rajya sarkaron kii madad ke bina bilkul bhi sambhav nahin he
 The Ministry of Railways will form a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the state governments for laying new tracks, in which both will have a stake
 iske liye uttar pradesh ko chhodkar sabhi rajya sahamat hai
 Hearing in Harish Rawat's much-publicized sting case The date for next hearing in Tallimalay is fixed for September 30 in the High Court of Uttarakhand High Court on Friday in the much-publicized sting case of former Chief Minister Harish Rawat

 At the same time, the Nainital High Court hearing the case had referred the case to a separate bench
 maaloom ho ki 2016 main uttarakhand ke tatkaleen mukhyamantri harish ravat dwaara vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht maamle kaa sting saamne aayaa tha
 After this, the Congress government fell in Uttarakhand and after the fall of the government, the CBI started an investigation against Harish Rawat with the recommendation of the Governor
 sibiai ne vidhayak kharid-farokht maamle main pichley dinon nainital hai court main modification aplicoshan daayar kii gai thi, jisamen kaha gaya ki is maamle main sibiai kii praarambhik jaanch puri ho chuki he
 Now Harish wants to arrest Rawat in this case
 hoicourt ne sibiai kii aplicoshan sweekaar kar lee he jiske baad yah saaf ho gaya ki ravat par giraftaar kabhi bhi ho sakati he
 After Bahubali 2, the discussion of Prabhas' next film has started

 bahubali kii safalataa soch se baahar thifilm bahubali 2 kii safalataa zyada wo uske bijness se utsahit hai kyonki unkitim ne 250-300 karodatak kii kamai sochi thi lekin asal main aankada kaaphi chaunkaane vaala tha

 The Indian team, which is ranked number 1 in the Test rankings, has a crushing defeat on the tour of South Africa
 capatoun main 72 ranon se haarane ke baad buudhvaar ko centurian main team india ko 135 ranon se haar jhelni padi
 This is Team India's first Test series on foreign soil
 is siries par aane se pehle bhartiya team ne apni taiyaariyon ko jaancha-parkhaa tha, lekin aisa kya hua ki team india ek ke baad ek match ganvaati ja rahi he
 For almost two years, the Indian team was writing a new success story
 iskaa credit captain viraat kohli ko diya ja rahaa tha to ab team kii is asafalataa kii jimmedaari bhi kohli ko uthaani hogi
 Virat Kohli's overconfidence is also an important reason for this plight of the Indian team
 aaie jaanate hai kin maukon par huiviraat kohli se chook
 The practice match was previously held for the touring team, which was later dropped
 team ke captain viraat kohli ne iskaa swaagat kiya tha

 Taking South Africa lightly, the Indian team defeated teams such as Australia, England and New Zealand on high pitches at home, but took South Africa lightly

 The latest example of how governments are myopic about development plans is the Ganga water lift scheme of Bihar government
 18 disambar kii shaam bihar sarkaar kii cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad soobe ke jal sansaadhan mantri sanjay kumaar jha ne foole na samaate hue twit kiyah "jal sansaadhan mantralay ke prastaav ko mili cabinet manjuuri se aahlaadit hum
 This versatile and unique scheme under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Jal Jeevan Hariyali Abhiyan will provide drinking water to cities like Ganga water lift scheme Gaya, Bodh Gaya and Rajgir
 "unka aglaa twit adhik suchnaprad tha jisamen bihar ke jal sansaadhan mantri ne bataaya, "gangaajal lift skim ke pehle charan kaa bajet 2836 karod rupye he or isse gaya ko 43 emsm (million cubic meter) or rajgir ko 7 emsm pani muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 This water will be sufficient for the needs of both cities of historical and religious importance
 "jha kaa teesraa twit yah bataane ke liye kaaphi tha ki ganga kaa pani hi phalgu nadi main shraddhaluon ke nahaane ke liye choda jayega
 Because this huge budget plan should have seen some benefit for the common people
 jha ke twit ke mutabik, 'yah yojana bihar sarkaar kii us koshish kaa hissaa he jiske tahat sarkaar phalgu nadi main saaf pani uplabdh karana chaahati he
 'the question is, why is there any doubt about this plan? Why is it that the river Falgu needs Ganga water at all? The rain in Gaya district does not decrease
 mausam vibhaag ke site par jaaen to aankade bataate hai ki gaya ke puure ilaake main ausatan barsaat 110 semi ke aasapaas hoti he
 But the truth is that 70 percent of the households under Gaya Municipal Corporation do not have tap water
 puure jile main bhoojal teji se neeche gir rahaa he
 This situation is when two more rivers, Jamuni and Morhar, exist along the Phalgu river in Gaya
 do saal pehle gaya ke jiladhikari sanjay singh ne in nadiyon kaa pani shahar tak pahunchane kii yojana banaai thi
 But no one survived this scheme
 aakhir, sarkaar pani ke naam par vaaki kuch bada karnaa chaahati thi
 The Bihar government too was in a dilemma about connecting Falgu to the Ganges and sometimes connecting Falgu to the Son River
 baharhaal, ganga kaa pani 170 kilometre lambey pipelin ke jariye mokama se gaya tak laane kaa kaam kisi ko machhlee dene jaisaa he, jabaki machhlee pakadana sikhaanaa behatar vikalp hota
 Why did the Bihar government not plan to improve the falling groundwater of Gaya to address the problem of Gaya water? Especially when the ground water level could be corrected by creating ponds and puddles in an area like Gaya and through rainwater harvesting
 vaigyanik maanate hai ki pani ko aayaat karnaa samasya kaa mahaj fori nivaaran hi he
 Watershed management, that is, stopping the local rain, correcting the level of ground water and supplying rainwater to the city would not only be a long-term solution but also cheaper and quicker than laying pipe lines
 sarkaar ko gaya, rajgir, navada jaise ilaakon main adhikadhik talab khudwane chahie the
 This would also increase fish production, provide water for irrigation of fields and water in wells
 saath bhi yah dhyaan bhi rakhana chahie tha ki gaya ke ilaake main abhi bhi acchhee khaasi kheti hoti he, jo bina pani ke mumkin nahin he
 The area of gaya has still not reached a situation like Bundelkhand
 haa, nadiyon ko jodna fishan or chalan main aa gaya he to baat or he
 On the other hand, Ganga herself is fighting for her survival
 agar garmiyon main usase 50 emsm pani nikaal liya jayega, to khud iske paaritantr par kya asar padegaa iskaa kya koi adhyayan bihar sarkaar ne karaayaa he?asal main, sarkaron ko lagata he ki nadi main pani bahakar or bachakar nikal jaae to vah pani kii barabaadi he
 While this is not the case, and if 50 MCM of water is taken out of Mokama, silt will also accumulate in the river bed in front of it
 kya rajya sarkaar uske liye taiyaar he?gaya ke aasapaas jis tarah kii dharti he vahaan watershed prabandhan bahut kargar bhi sabit hota
 Last summer, even in the districts like Darbhanga and Madhubani in the Mithila region, waterlogged pokhras were dried up for years, there is no plan to raise them in the government
 par, ganga kaa pani gaya bhejne kii yojana ko jistarah fatafat lagu karne kii taiyaari he or jis tarah se uske liye rakam bhi jari kii gai he, usase to sarkaar ke vikaas vaale vijan par sawalia nishaan or bhi gaharaa hi ho gaya he

" pichley varsh ek bori cement 260 rupye or ek bori baaluu yaa maurang 38 rupye main milti thi
 Today the price of cement is the same but the value of sand or maurang has reached Rs 150 per bag

 That's why most construction projects are closed
 ''baaluu or maurang kii anuplabdhta (dekhen graphics) ke chalate puure pradesh main vikaas kaary thap-se pade hai
 According to the estimates of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI), construction projects above Rs 1 lakh crore have come to a standstill due to non-availability of sand and maurang in Uttar Pradesh

 '' ashish sagar kehete hai ''desh main anaaj kii keemat tay karne ke liye to niamak hai lekin bhawan nirmaan saamagree tay karne ke liye koi niamak nahin he

 The Chief Minister's Secretariat, while affirming a Cabinet decision, not only canceled the allotment of hospital land but also imposed a fine of Rs 34 crore 30 lakh for delay in construction of the hospital
 darasal, vedanta group baalkon ne nayaa raipur main cancer aspataal banane ke liye chhattisgarh sarkaar ke saath ek mou sin kiya tha
 The mou, which took place seven years ago, has not been finalized yet
 vedanta group ne aspataal nirmaan kii disha main koi teji nahin dikhaai
 Therefore, in the event of violation of the terms of the mou, the Raman cabinet took a big decision against Vedanta and canceled the land allotment
 yahi nahin, vartmaan prachlit guidelins ke anusaar 34 karod 30 lakh rupee jurmaana bhi laga di he
 However, after the payment of the fine amount, a fresh allotment of land was also directed
 yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki cabinet ke is faisle par shanivaar ko muhar bhi laga di gayi
 In 2011, the Chhattisgarh government had allotted 15 acres of land to the Vedanta Medical Research Foundation for an annual lease of just one rupee in the new capital
 is dauraan vedanta group ne sarkaar ke saath kiye gaye qaraar main yah kaha tha ki wo no profit no los kii sthiti main cancer se peedit marijon kaa ilaaj karegaa
 Prior to the allotment of land to Vedanta group in New Raipur, the state government had allocated eight hectares of land in Saddu area adjacent to Raipur for this hospital
 lekin vedanta samooh ne us sthaan main bhi aspataal banane main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai thi
 However, after a few months he returned this land to the government and requested to provide land in New Raipur
 sarkaar ne ise sweekaar kiya or nae raipur main 15 acre jameen aavantit kar di
 But here too, the work of building the hospital did not catch up
 aakhirkar sarkaar ko is jameen kaavantanbhi nirast karnaa padaa
 Giving information about this decision of the government, government spokesperson and state agriculture minister Brijmohan Aggarwal said that the Vedanta Balco group has violated the terms of the mou
 isi ke tahat yah karrwai kii gayi he
 On the other hand, after the decision to cancel the lease allocation, the process of hospital construction has been expedited

 zyaadaatar logon main isaki behad kami hoti he
 This is the reason why a man is unable to truly capture his experiences
 chunki ham apane anubhavon ko pakad nahin pate, isliye uskaa phayda nahin uthaa pate
 Since they are unable to take advantage of it, they do not understand its value
 or ham sab yah to jaanate hi hai ki aadmi swabhaav se hi itnaa lobhi hota he ki jab tak use kisi cheez kii keemat kaa pataa na lage, tab tak vah uski kadra nahin karata he
 The better price, the higher the value
 kaash! ki vah apane anubhavon ko hi apane jivan kaa paryaay samaj paata! jis din aisa ho jayega, us din se uske kaaryon or vichaaron kaa focus jivan na hokar anubhav ho jayega
 Instead of working for the pleasure of life, he will start working for the beauty of experiences
 jaahir he ki aisa karte hi uski bahari yatra aantarik yatra kii ore mud jaaegi
 i can claim that from the same day everything will change and this change will be for his betterment
 aap mere is ek chote se kintu bahut vyaavhaarik sawaal ke bare main sochakar dekhie
 You currently have a car that costs five lakh rupees
 car kaa daayitv keval yah he ki vah aapako ek jagah se duusari jagah par bina kisi baadha ke aaraam ke saath pahunchaa de
 Now your car is doing its job well
 lekin ek din aap us car ko bech dete hai or uski jagah ek duusari car kharidte hai, jisaki keemat 12 lakh rupee he
 Obviously, if you look at it in terms of utility, then your car will also do the same thing as the previous car
 to meraa sawaal yah he ki aapane pehali vaali car ko bechaa kyon? yah kaam isliye nahin kiya, kyonki aapako us car kii jarurat nahin thi
 If this happens, you do not take another car
 aapane duusari car kharidi, jo pehali car kii tulana main doguni se bhi adhik mahangi thi
 So my question to you here is why did you do this? yahaan aap mujhe bhautikwaad kaa virdohi samajhane kii bhul na karen
 If i have given an example of an expensive car here, do not imply that i am opposed to good and expensive cars
 aarthik kshetra main unki apni upyogita hoti he
 i am not concerned here
 main to yahaan jivan ke bare main baaten kar rahaa hoon
 You can have any of my own answers to this question
 lekin mere paas jo uttar he, vah yah ki 'aapane nai car keval isliye kharidi he, kyonki usko kharidne se aapako acha laga he
 'I have given a very small reason-' It is good
 ' is jumale kaa istemaal ham apane rosemara ke jivan main na jane kitni baar karte hai- acha lagata he yaa phir acha nahin lagata yaa sidhe-sidhe yah ki bura lagata he
 These three are the same, because the basic center that drives these three thoughts and feelings is 'good'
 to kya isse yah siddh nahin hota ki 'jivan maatr ek anubhav he
 ' desh, duniya, mahanagar khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua
