 During this time Palshiker did not get hurt though

 " vahiin palshikar ne kaha ki unhone todphod karne waalon ke khilaaf koi shikaayat darj nahin karai he
 This issue is being given unnecessarily political color

" ve logon ko shaadi, behatar naukari or jivan style ke bahaane dharm parivartan karne kaa laalach dete hai
 Justice Aditya Nath Mittal, UP State Law Commission Chief: We don't have any existing provisions to stop such conversions
 That's why we have recommended new legislation to stop religious conversions, submitted the report to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister
 (2 / 2) https: / / t
 co / no4xsydvhz— ANI UP (@aninewsup)november 21, 2019justise mittal ne kaha, aise dharmataranon ko rokane ke liye hamaare paas koi maujuuda praavdhaan nahin he
 Therefore, we have recommended new legislation to prevent conversion
 is bare main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko report saunpi he
 The report that has been submitted on the conversion will come under the purview of the conversion law, it has been named - UP Freedom of Religion Act
 is nae act ke tahat ek dharm se duusare dharm main parivartan karaane ke liye main agar koi vyakti kisi bhi tarah kaa laalach, jabardastee, taaqat kaa istemaal karata he yaa phir dharm parivartan ke liye bahalaata-phusalaata yaa uksaata hua paaya jaataa he to he to wo dand kaa bhaagi hoga

 bijepi ne dilli parivahan nigam (DTC) maamle kii uparajyapal najeeb jang se sibiai jaanch karaane kii maang kii he
 Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay has alleged that the Kejriwal government has, on one hand, repeatedly fooled the people of Delhi by announcing the increase in the fleet of DTC buses
 vahiin, ab sarkaar ditisi ko nijee haathon main saunpna chaahati he, jisaki jaanch jaruri he
 DTC is in loss of Rs 3 crore per day DTC In the first budget, Chief Minister Kejriwal had announced to run 10,000 DTC buses in Delhi, but even after 17 months we did not get a new bus in Delhi to join the DTC fleet
 sarkaar ke nai basen laane ke bade-bade daawey jhuthe sabit hue hai
 The truth is that during the Kejriwal rule, 1000 DTC buses of Delhi roads have been removed and today the DTC has a loss of almost Rs 3 crore per day
 vahiin, sarkaar 8 agast se aam aadmi bas chalaane ja rahi he
 Due to these reasons, the loss of DTC is causing huge operational losses, mainly due to: - removal of buses from profitable routes, running buses on non-viable interstate routes and large number of buses malfunction
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ek sajeesh ke tahat basen kharaab hoti hai
 They are ignored for hours, so that the daily wages are poor and deliberately withdrawn the SEDTC buses on the benefit routes and give them to the cluster operators
 cluster bas sevaayen bhi bana rahe durijanvari 2015 tak ausatan 600 bason main tut-foot kii jaankaree saamne aati thi, lekin saal ke aakhir tak yah ausat 800 bason ke prati maheene thap hone tak ja pahunchi
 Due to wrong policies on public bus service system of Delhi Government, private cluster bus services are also running today and about 250 Orange cluster buses have been removed from the roads

 Is the BJP exaggerating its victory in the local body elections in Uttar Pradesh? Have these victories been rigged in evms and have all the BJP candidates lost elections in their strongholds of prominent BJP leaders in UP? These questions have been raised by senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav

 mukherjee ne kaha, "drushtikonon main bhinnata thi lekin donon ne use khud tak rakhaa or kareebi sahyog main kaary kiya
 This did not affect the relationship between the President and the Prime Minister, that is, the relationship between the head of Baray and the de facto head of administration
 "mukherjee ne ingit kiya ki aise bhi maukey aae jab unhone vitt mantri arun jetali se spashtikaran maange or unhone praaia: vibhinn muddon par sarkari nazariye ko saaf kiya
 According to the President, Jaitley often satisfied him with his words, as does a qualified and effective lawyer, who he is
 raashtrapati jis vakt ye sab kah rahe the, us vakt jetali bhi vahaan maujuud the
 The president said that he can claim with confidence that "the functioning of the government has never been interrupted, it has never been stopped and it has never been delayed
" "raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii ye do tippaniyan hi bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki raisina hill main raashtrapati ke taur par unka kaarykaal kaisaa rahaa
 President Mukherjee always avoided unnecessary risk
 aise bhi kai mudde rahe jin par sarkaar raashtrapati mukherjee ko spashtikaran dene ke baad hi unke hastakshar lene main safal ho saki
 When the NDA government came to power on 26 May 2014, between March 2015 the government brought 10 ordinances
 tab sarkaar ko rajyasabha main vipaksh ke bahumat ke bich avarodhon kaa saamana tha
 Although President Mukherjee did not pose any obstacle in the way of the government, he made it aware of the fact that the government has limited power to issue ordinances, plus executive order should be the last option
 isi tarah raashtrapati mukherjee ke paas may 2016 main NEET adhyadesh bheja gaya tha, jo rajyon ko khud kii medical pravesh parikshaayen karaane kaa adhikaar detaa tha
 Mukherjee then called his legal team, Health Minister JP Nadda, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi and Health Ministry officials for discussions
 raashtrapati ne do din kaa samay liya
 Also asked the government why it is so early
 raashtrapati ne ye bhi poocha ki ek baar adhyadesh amal main aa gaya to maujuuda daakhila prakriya kaa kya hoga
 The President asked the Health Minister to clear the situation on the ordinance
 poocha ki kyon rajyon ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 The President summoned Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on the Insurance Ordinance
 bataa den ki beemaa adhyadesh ko endie sarkaar apane pehle big tikat sudhaar ke kadam ke taur par pesh kar rahi thi
 a few months later, President Mukherjee also discussed all aspects of the land acquisition bill with the government
 beete saal disambar main sarkaar ne vivaadaaspad shatru sampatti adhyadesh bheja kyonki isi mudde par vidheyak sansadeey samiti main atak gaya tha
 Mukherjee then called his team of legal experts and asked the government to clarify
 unki aapatti saadhaaran thi- adhyadesh ek sthanapann bandobast he or kaaryakari aadesh, jise sansad kii manjuuri kii aavashyaktaa he, ko paanchavin baar badhanaa sansadeey tantra ko kamjor karne jaisaa hoga
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ran towards Rashtrapati Bhavan, as he had done many times before, on Mukherjee's attitude
 jetali ne spashtikaran di ki adhyadesh kyon jaruri he
 The President could have returned the ordinance passed by the Cabinet under the Constitutional provision, if the President had desired, the same step as President APJ Abdul Kalam had taken once in his tenure
 lekin mukherjee ne takaraav ko taalna hi behatar samajha kyonki wo jaanate the ki sarkaar ke paas adhyadesh ko paas kar dobaaraa unke paas bhejne kii shakti he
 If that were the case, the President would have no choice but to approve the Cabinet recommendation
 mukherjee ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki raashtrapati saidhantik taur par cabinet ke faislon ko sirf saarvajanik taur par dikhaane ke uddeshy se waapas karne ke paksh main nahin rahe
 a similar situation was created in January 2016
 centre sarkaar ne raajnneetik uthalputhal vaale arunachal pradesh raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The President was not sure why the Central Government wanted to use Article 356
 tab kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh raashtrapati mukherjee se mili or is sifarish ke kaarnon kaa hawala diya
 According to Rashtrapati Bhavan sources, President Mukherjee signed it only after he was fully satisfied that the state was facing a constitutional crisis
 yadhyapi raajnneetik paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki raashtrapati mukherjee ne beshak saarvajanik taur par sarkaar ke saath takaraav ke kshan utpann nahin hone die lekin unhone jab bhi jarurat samajhi, sahi vakt par sarkaar ko dridhtaa ke saath sandesh die
 Three times in the last few months he expressed a clear and definite opinion
 kai shaikshanik sansthaanon main virodh pradarshan ke dauraan raashtrapati abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke paksh main bole
 In May this year, he openly praised his former boss Indira Gandhi during a memorial speech
 mukherjee ne kaha, "wo 20veen sadi main puri duniya or bharat ke logon ke liye asaadhaaran shakhsiyat thi
 Even after saying goodbye to his world, he is still the most accepted ruler or prime minister of a democratic country
 "desh main beete do varsh main bheed kii ore se logon ko peet peet kar maar daalane kii ghatnaon ke pariprekshya main mukherjee ne beete shanivaar ko kaha, "kya ham itane sajag hai ki apane samay ke buniyadi mulyon kii raksha kar saken
 i believe that the vigilance of the people and media can prove to be the biggest deterrent against the forces of darkness and backwardness
 " raashtrapati mukherjee ne ye bhi kaha ki "is mudde ko lekar kisi ke kartavya ko koi mitaa nahin saktaa
 The coming generations asked us for an answer to what we did
 main ye sawaal apane aap se hi poochta hum
 "however, the sources also said that Pranab Mukherjee was probably the most aforementioned president to work with a different working Prime Minister who was relatively new to Delhi
 pradhanmantri narendra modine gujarat se aane ke baad dilli jaldi settle ho jane ke liye 'raashtrapati se mili madad' ko shrey diya
 According to a senior minister in the government, President Mukherjee is so politically efficient, so aware of the requirements of the Constitution, so knowledgeable about policies that many ministers of NDA would always find it pleasant to go to President Bhavan
 mantri ne kaha, "aisa koi mudda nahin jisase ateet main wo nipate naa hon
 Individuals who chaired about 80 cabinet groups of the UPA government till May 2014
 wo sandarbhon ke liye encychlopedia jaise hai
 And the biggest thing is that there is no one whom Pranab da cannot reprimand when he feels the need

 Of the seven seats in Bihar which went to polls on April 24, four seats in Araria, Katihar, Purnia and Bhagalpur went to the BJP account in 2009
 tab nitish kumaar kii jedy(you) ne supaul seat ko endie ke khate main joda tha
 If the independent candidate Digvijay Singh won from Banka, the Congress had to be satisfied with one seat in Kishanganj
 lekin pichley paanch varshon main sameekaran puri tarah se badal gaye hai
 BJP and JDU, which contested simultaneously in 2009, have become bitter enemies today, unlike last time, this time RJD and Congress have joined hands
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya iskaa nateezon par koi asar hoga?arriya, purniya or katihaar bihar ke muslim bahul simanchal ilaake main hai
 While Bhagalpur is also largely similar to Seemanchal in terms of population component and voting behavior
 haalanki in siton par 2009 main endie kaa jabardast pradarshan is vajah se sambhav hua tha kyonki jedy (you) or bijepi saath milakar lade the
 People from the backward classes and upper castes joined together with their alliance
 sone par suhaaga alpsankhyakon kaa atirikt vot tha jo sanyukt endie ko hasil hua tha
 But this time the sour relationship between them has also divided the vote bank, which opens the window of opportunity for Lalu Prasad Yadav
 bihar main loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle do charan jahaan bijepi ke liye achche maane ja rahe hai, vahiin 24 april ko hue tisare charan ke chunaav is baat kii pariksha hogi ki narendra modi kaa vastav main bihar main asar he yaa nahin
 The results of this phase will also prove whether Lalu is able to return to Bihar politics
 sthiti aisi lag rahi he ki modi kii vajah se kaaphi had tak mahatvapurn muslim voton kaa dhruvikaran us party ke paksh main ho rahaa he jo bijepi ko haraane main sakasham ho
 On the other hand, after separating from the BJP, the upper castes from the JD (U) have lost their votes
 lalu ke netritv main congress-argedy gathbandhan ko yah ummid he ki bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan tuutane se unke pradarshan main sudhaar hoga
 Says a senior RJD leader, "in 2009, JD (U) -BJP fought together while Congress and RJD were separate and against each other
" ab bijepi or jedy (you) alag ho gaye hai, jabaki congress or argedy ne haath mila liya he
 Now it's time for our return
 ’’in siton par bijepi ne apane chaar maujuuda saansadon par hi bharosa jataate hue unhen phir se maidan main utaara
 In 2009, Shahnawaz Hussain from Bhagalpur, Uday Singh (pappu) from Purnia, Nikhil Chaudhary from Katihar and Pradeep Singh from Araria won easily
 lekin is baar chaaron siton par trikoniya muqabla he
 He now hopes that Modi's wave will compensate for the minority votes that he won in 2009
 lekin is par anischitata kaayam he
 In Muslim-majority Araria, the old RJD warrior Mohammad Taslimuddin is giving a tough fight to bjp's Pradeep Singh
 bijepi ke do or maujuuda saansadon udai singh or nikhil choudhary ke liye bhi is baar muqabla kathin he
 These are some of the seats where JD (U) candidates have a tough fight with BJP
 nattejey hi bataaenge ki udai singh jedy (you) ke santosh kushvaha or congress ke amarnath tiwari se mil rahi chunauti se nibat pate hai yaa nahin
 Nikhil Chaudhary, who won by just 14,000 votes in 2009, is once again facing a tough fight with Nationalist Congress Party candidate Tariq Anwar who also has the support of RJD and Congress
 tarik ke liye phaayde vaali baat yah he ki katihaar main 42 fisadi muslim voter hai
 Shahnawaz Hussain, the bjp's Muslim face, is also caught in a tough battle with rjd's Bulo Mandal in Bhagalpur 
 mandal kii ummidavaari ko lalu prasad kaa turup kaa patta mana ja rahaa he jinhone ganghota jati ke ummidavaar ko tikat dekar muslim, yadav or ganghota gathbandhan banane kaa prayaas kiya he jo bijepi ke savarna, baniyaa or ati pichhadaa varg (ibisi) ke ek hisse vaale samarthan aadhaar par baari pad saktaa he
 Similarly, this time Putul Kumari, who won an independent from Banka in 2010 in Banka, is contesting on a BJP ticket, facing a tough fight against rjd's Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav and cpi's Santosh Kumar
 putul bhi modi lahar ke bharose apni naiya paar lagane kii ummid kar rahi hai
 Although the Muslim population in Banka is not as much as in the districts of Seemanchal, but there is no organizational base of BJP there
 yah un kuch siton main se he jahaan jedy (you) ke saath pichley 17 saal main gathbandhan kii vajah se bijepi ne chunaav nahin ladaa tha
 Obviously, bjp's path is difficult in these seats and Modi's path will not be easy
 duusari ore jharkhand main jin chaar siton ke liye chunaav hue hai, unamem sabase mahatvapurn ladaai dumka main he jahaan jeemem pramukh or maujuuda saansad shibu sorain sambhawatah apni jindagi ke sabase kathin chunaav kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Soren, a three-time Chief Minister of Jharkhand, is trying to save this seat where he is being challenged by two strong candidates, Jharkhand's first Chief Minister Babulal Marandi and bjp's Sunil Soren
 shibu dumka se nau baar lok sabha chunaav lade hai or inamen se saat baar jite hai
 But he narrowly survived in 2009 when he received 2,08,518 votes and bjp's Sunil Soren came very close to him with 1,89,706 votes
 sunil is baar modi kii lahar par savaar hokar dumka se jeetne kii koshish main lage hai
 On the other hand, Babulal Marandi has contested the Lok Sabha elections four times from Dumka
 vah do baar shibu sorain se haar chuke hai or do baar unhen jeet bhi mili he, ek baar sorain ke khilaaf or ek baar unki patni rupi sorain ke khilaaf
 The support base of these two tribal heroes of Jharkhand is the same, it can be understood why both are so bitterly opposed to each other
 ramgarh jile main janme shibu 1960 ke dashak main shoshak sahukaaron ke khilaaf ladaai kaa netritv karne santhal pargana chale gaye the
 Soon he became the most formidable force of the state
 vahiin duusari ore giridih se marandi ko aresas ne 1980 ke dashak main santhal pargana main shakhaon ko majboot karne ko bheja tha
 While Shibu is old, his son Hemant Soren is leading an unpopular government in Jharkhand
 aise main marandi is chunaav main santhal pargana ko jeemem ke haathon se chhinane kaa avasar dekh rahe hai
 Whoever wins in Dumka will benefit in the assembly elections
 24 april ko chaar loksabhaa siton dhanbad, godda, rajmahal or dumka main matdaan khatm hone ke baad pradesh main aam chunaav ke sabhi charan puure ho gaye hai
 Elections for the 14 Lok Sabha seats of Jharkhand will also be an indication for the upcoming assembly elections, which are due this year
 misr ke sinai main isi maah 224 savaaron ke saath ek roosi metroget vimaan ko jis bam ke jariye maar giraaya gaya tha, vah bhartiya sena ke bam dyspozal squad ke visheshgyon ke liye koi nai chiz nahin he
 
 
 This type of bomb was first seen in Jammu and Kashmir almost two decades ago, when it had the form of 'soda can'
 
 
 is improwised explosive divaais (improvised explosive device - iidi) ko asembal karnaa, yani taiyaar karnaa kaaphi aasaan hota he, or iskaa asar ek hand grenade jaisaa hi hota he, agar isamen ek kilo ardex (RDX) jaisaa koi plastic visphotak bharaa hua ho
 
 
 The pressure of the air when a modern aircraft is flying makes the 'soda can bomb' more deadly
 
 
 vimaan main iskaa visphot na sirf airfrem ko tod daalega, jisase cabin di-compress ho jayega, or yatriyon kaa dam ghut jayega, balki yah vimaan ke dhaanche ko bhi itnaa nuksaan pahunchaa degaa ki vimaan neeche ja giregaa
 
 
 Apart from the 'soda can bomb', several ieds are housed at the headquarters of the army bomb disposal squad in Akhnoor near Jammu
 
 
 inamen se koi bhi asal main bam jaisaa nahin dikhataa he, or inamen tedi bear, gudiya, guladasta, cold drink kii chaar botalon kaa dibba, lipta hua gadda jaisi chizein shaamil hai
 
 
 Shake any of them out of your place, and the siren will ring
 
 
 agar yah asli hote, to aap nishchit rup se tukade-tukade ho gaye hote, kyonki tab koi syran nahin bajataa, sirf visphot hota
 
 
 Lieutenant Colonel N
 in charge of this squad of Northern Command
 roshayan (lieutenant Colonel N
 Roshyan) reported, "it's like a game of mouse-cat
 
 
 " unke mutabik, ardex jaise plastic visphotakon se nipatna bahut badi chunauti he
 
 
 He said, "they are light in weight
 
 
 inhen kisi bhi aakaar main dhaala ja saktaa he, or inhen bam ke rup main pahachaanaa janaa mushkil hota he, jisaki vajah se ye aatankwaadiyon kaa pasandida hathiyaar hai
 
 
 " 
 
 
 And to prove that ieds are difficult to identify, i was asked to walk to the place (which actually looks like a park in any residential area)
 
 
 lekin asal main vah park nahin, improwised explosive divaais range he
 
 
 As soon as i crossed a barricade, the alarm rang
 
 
 darasal maine inphra-red sensor ko laangh liya tha
 
 
 It could have been attached to a bomb, which would have exploded immediately
 
 
 kuch hi foot kii duuri par bane guard room main mujhase guest-book par dastakhat karne ke liye kaha gaya, lekin jaise hi maine book ko kholaa, alarm phir baj uthaa
 
 
 By now it was quite easy for me to understand the meaning of this alarm
 
 
 park main tahaltey-tahaltey meraa paanv pathar jaisi dikhne vaali kisi chiz par padaa, lekin vah bhi barudi surang nikali
 
 
 i had never seen it before, and frankly, anyone who would have tragically stepped on the real tunnel, would not have found it
 
 
 yahaan aise bahut-se udhaaharan maujuud hai, jinase saaf-saaf samajha ja saktaa he ki koi bhi chiz bam ho sakati he, or sirf chaukanna rahanaa hi kaaphi nahin hota
 
 
 For more than two decades, our military has come to know - often by paying a heavy price for it - how dangerous and deadly improvised explosive devices can be, and also by the quickest eyes of the best trained people It is often difficult to identify them
 
 
 aaj ke daur main hamaari sena iidi ke khatre se bachane ke liye kai tarah kii takneekon kaa istemaal karne lagi he
 
 
 In the wee hours of the morning, military teams, especially the ieds, minefields, and water pipes hidden under the ground, find similar bombs
 
 
 is tarah ke bamon ko remote control ke jariye bhi udaaya ja saktaa he, or yah bhi mumkin he ki uske taar kisi trigar se jude hon, jise haath main liye koi aatankwaadi kahi chhipakar baitha ho
 
 
 These ieds can also be connected to timers, which can be programmed to burst even after 100–100 days
 
 
 leftinent karnal roshayan ke anusaar, "pichley do dashakon main ham apane abhyaas ke tareekon or sanchaalan prakriyaaon main zarurat ke hisaab se badlaav laae hai
 
 
 We have also acquired the necessary equipment while realizing the requirements
 
 
 ham apni prashikshan prakriya main bhi vakt or zarurat ke hisaab se badlaav karte hai
 
 
 " jo faujee aise ilaake main gasht par rahete hai, jahaan iidi chhipe hone kaa andeshaa ho, unke liye kai paraton main suraksha kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 
 
 At the forefront are sniffing dogs - the tremendous trained Labrador Retrievers or German Shepards - who work at a pre-determined pace and manner at the behest of their trainers
 
 
 inamen se prayek kute ko sena ke meerut sthit rimount veterinary corps (remount Veterinary Corps) main prashikshan diya gaya he
 
 
 The training program of these dogs also continues continuously
 
 
 har daste ke kutton ko har kuch hafte baad rifressure course bhi diya jaataa he, taaki inkaa dimag chaukanna rahe, or yah badalte maahaul or halaat ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal saken
 
 
 At the training range, i was introduced to a five-year-old Labrador retriever named Dante
 
 
 dante ko iidi khojane vaale uttari cmand ke behtareen kutton main shumaar kiya jaataa he, or kaha jaataa he ki isaki naak ne bahut-si jaanon ko bachaaya he
 
 
 i went with Dante and his trainer to a fake bus stop, where Dante suddenly stopped, and sat quietly
 
 
 use kuch mil gaya tha
 
 
 His trainer picked up a bed nearby, and we were not surprised when an explosive was found there
 
 
 in kutton ke saath chalane vaali faujee team, jo sadakon kii padtaal karti he, apni peeth par laden backpac (backpack - baste) main jaimar (jammer) lekar chalati he, jisase kisi iidi ko trigar karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale remote control ke siganlon ko bekaar kiya ja sake
 
 
 In other areas, jammers are deployed at pre-determined locations
 
 
 vaise, jamaron ko faujee gadiyon main bhi lagaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Although the army appeared reluctant to talk about some of the jammer's special capabilities, NDTV found that most jammers could operate in a variety of different modes, including 'pre-initiation mode', Under which the army can blow up itself before the remote controlled IED gets a signal from the terrorists
 
 
 sena ke liye aatankwaadiyon se ek kadam aage rahane kaa ek hi sunishchit tarika he - yah pakkaa kar liya jaae ki ilaake kii har radio frequency ko har vakt jamaron se cover karke rakhaa jaae
 
 
 Our training during training is completely changed when an IED is found, and has to be destroyed or destroyed
 
 
 puraane vakt main bam-nirodhak daste khud bam ke paas jaakar use naakaam kiya karte the, lekin ab hamaari sena remoteli oparated whical (arovi - Remotely Operated Vehicles - ROV) istemaal karne ko tarjeeh detii he
 
 
 The British Wheelbarrow ROV is powered by a battery, and with the help of cameras on it, its operator is able to see the IED at a safe distance
 
 
 75 kilogram tak kaa vazan uthaane main sakasham wheelbaro aamtaur par aatankwaadiyon kii laashon ko palatney ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jo aksar kisi muthbhed main marane se turant pehle apane sharir ke neeche zindaa hand grenade rakh liya karte hai
 
 
 Later, while removing the corpses, the hand grenade explodes as soon as the security forces move the corpse of the terrorist
 
 
 lekin ab aisa nahin hota
 
 
 Now even if there is an explosion, its impact is not our military, the wheelbarrow-like ROV suffers
 
 
 iske alaava arovi chhipi hui iidi ko bhi apane maikenical panjon se khinchati hai, or inamen diserptor maikenism (disrupter mechanism) bhi laga hota he, jo darasal ek bandook jaisi chiz hoti he, jo naakaam nahin ho pai iidi ko nuksaan pahunchaa paane se pehle surakshit duuri par phenk detii he
 
 
 But despite all this, there are occasions where bomb disposal squad technicians, officers and soldiers have to go to the bomb themselves and try to thwart it by hand
 
 
 yah ek aisa behad khatarnaak kaam he, jisamen focus, kushalta or takat kii madad se hi zindagi ke saath rahakar maut ko maat di ja sakati he

 ye adhikari kambind officers explocivs course (combined Officers Explosives Course) main bhi bhaag lete hai - yaa sena main kamishan kiye jane ke turant baad yaa 10 saal ke bheetar
 
 
 Once trained, they are deployed with counter-terrorism units - like Rashtriya Rifles in Jammu and Kashmir and Special Counter Explosive Device Units deployed across the country
 
 
 40 kilogram tak vazan vaale baari surakshatmak bam-nirodhak suut pahane sena ke in takanicianon ke seene, gardan or sir kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, jab ye zamin par iidi kii bagal main letkar use nihaar rahe hote hai
 
 
 They also have a telescopic manipulator to operate, which maintains a distance between the person and the IED when the IED is being removed from a hidden location, but ultimately human fingers to thwart the bomb
 It is important to have someone whose mind works very fast
 
 
 in bam takanicianon kii madad ke liye adhikari bhi rahete hai, jo radio par unase lagaataar sampark main rahete hai
 
 
 With the help of a camera mounted on the technician's helmet, the officer on a screen watches everything that the technician is seeing in front of him

 However, finding and thwarting ieds is a never-ending game of life and death that changes daily with changing technology
 
 
 bam-nirodhak daston ke ye takanisian jaanate hai ki agar inhen khud ko zindaa rakhana he, to inhen har baar kaamyaab hona hi hoga, varanaa aatankwaadiyon kii sirf ek kamyaabi bhi inhen hameshaa ke liye sula sakati he

 For more than two decades, our military has come to know - often by paying a heavy price for it - how dangerous and deadly improvised explosive devices can be, and also by the quickest eyes of the best trained people It is often difficult to identify them
 
 
 aaj ke daur main hamaari sena iidi ke khatre se bachane ke liye kai tarah kii takneekon kaa istemaal karne lagi he
 
 
 In the wee hours of the morning, military teams, especially the ieds, minefields, and water pipes hidden under the ground, find similar bombs
 
 
 is tarah ke bamon ko remote control ke jariye bhi udaaya ja saktaa he, or yah bhi mumkin he ki uske taar kisi trigar se jude hon, jise haath main liye koi aatankwaadi kahi chhipakar baitha ho
 
 
 These ieds can also be connected to timers, which can be programmed to burst even after 100–100 days

 i went with Dante and his trainer to a fake bus stop, where Dante suddenly stopped, and sat quietly

 His trainer picked up a bed nearby, and we were not surprised when an explosive was found there
 
 
 in kutton ke saath chalane vaali faujee team, jo sadakon kii padtaal karti he, apni peeth par laden backpac (backpack - baste) main jaimar (jammer) lekar chalati he, jisase kisi iidi ko trigar karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale remote control ke siganlon ko bekaar kiya ja sake
 
 
 In other areas, jammers are deployed at pre-determined locations
 
 
 vaise, jamaron ko faujee gadiyon main bhi lagaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Although the army appeared reluctant to talk about some of the jammer's special capabilities, NDTV found that most jammers could operate in a variety of different modes, including 'pre-initiation mode', Under which the army can blow up itself before the remote controlled IED gets a signal from the terrorists

 In today's era, our army has started using many types of techniques to avoid the threat of IED
 
 
 tadake hi sadakon kii padtaal karne nikal jane vaali faujee team khaastaur par iidi, barudi surangen, or zamin ke neeche chhipe pani ke pipon main isi tarah ke bamon ko hi khojati hai
 
 
 Such bombs can also be flown through remote control, and it is possible that its wires are connected to a trigger, which is hidden by a terrorist in hand
 
 
 in iidi ko timaron se bhi joda ja saktaa he, jinhen 100-100 din baad tak bhi fatne ke liye program kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 According to Lieutenant Colonel Roshyan, "over the past two decades, we have changed our practice methods and operating procedures according to need
 
 
 hamane zaruuraton ko samajhate hue zaruri upkaran bhi hasil kiye hai
 
 
 We also make changes in our training process according to time and need

 There is only one sure way for the army to stay one step ahead of the terrorists - ensure that every radio frequency in the area is covered by jammers at all times

 In addition, the ROV also pulls out the hidden ieds from its mechanical claws, and also has a disrupter mechanism, which is actually a gun-like thing, which could not fail before the IED was damaged

 ye adhikari kambind officers explocivs course (combined Officers Explosives Course) main bhi bhaag lete hai - yaa sena main kamishan kiye jane ke turant baad yaa 10 saal ke bheetar
 
 
 Once trained, they are deployed with counter-terrorism units - such as the Rashtriya Rifles in Jammu and Kashmir and the Counter Explosive Device Units deployed across the country 
 
 
 40 kilogram tak vazan vaale baari surakshatmak bam-nirodhak suut pahane sena ke in takanicianon ke seene, gardan or sir kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, jab ye zamin par iidi kii bagal main letkar use nihaar rahe hote hai
 
 
 They also have a telescopic manipulator to operate, which maintains a distance between the person and the IED when the IED is being removed from a hidden location, but ultimately human fingers to thwart the bomb
 It is important to have someone whose mind works very fast
 
 
 in bam takanicianon kii madad ke liye adhikari bhi rahete hai, jo radio par unase lagaataar sampark main rahete hai
 
 
 With the help of a camera mounted on the technician's helmet, the officer on a screen watches everything that the technician is seeing in front of him
 
 
 tippaniyan One moment is precious for them
 
 
 ye bam takanisian bina thake kaam nahin kar sakate, kyonki bhale hi inke baari suut ke bheetar inhen thanda rakhane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, lekin ek hi baar main aadha ghante se zyaada vakt tak lagaataar kaam karnaa, khaastaur se garmiyon main, lagbhag naammumkin hota he
 
 
 However, finding and thwarting ieds is a never-ending game of life and death that changes daily with changing technology
 
 
 bam-nirodhak daston ke ye takanisian jaanate hai ki agar inhen khud ko zindaa rakhana he, to inhen har baar kaamyaab hona hi hoga, varanaa aatankwaadiyon kii sirf ek kamyaabi bhi inhen hameshaa ke liye sula sakati he
 
 
 At the training range, i was introduced to a five-year-old Labrador retriever named Dante
 
 
 dante ko iidi khojane vaale uttari cmand ke behtareen kutton main shumaar kiya jaataa he, or kaha jaataa he ki isaki naak ne bahut-si jaanon ko bachaaya he
 
 
 i went with Dante and his trainer to a fake bus stop, where Dante suddenly stopped, and sat quietly
 
 
 use kuch mil gaya tha
 
 
 His trainer picked up a bed nearby, and we were not surprised when an explosive was found there
 
 
 in kutton ke saath chalane vaali faujee team, jo sadakon kii padtaal karti he, apni peeth par laden backpac (backpack - baste) main jaimar (jammer) lekar chalati he, jisase kisi iidi ko trigar karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale remote control ke siganlon ko bekaar kiya ja sake
 
 
 In other areas, jammers are deployed at pre-determined locations
 
 
 vaise, jamaron ko faujee gadiyon main bhi lagaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Although the army appeared reluctant to talk about some of the jammer's special capabilities, NDTV found that most jammers could operate in a variety of different modes, including 'pre-initiation mode', Under which the army can blow up itself before the remote controlled IED gets a signal from the terrorists
 
 
 sena ke liye aatankwaadiyon se ek kadam aage rahane kaa ek hi sunishchit tarika he - yah pakkaa kar liya jaae ki ilaake kii har radio frequency ko har vakt jamaron se cover karke rakhaa jaae
 
 
 Our training during training is completely changed when an IED is found, and has to be destroyed or destroyed
 
 
 puraane vakt main bam-nirodhak daste khud bam ke paas jaakar use naakaam kiya karte the, lekin ab hamaari sena remoteli oparated whical (arovi - Remotely Operated Vehicles - ROV) istemaal karne ko tarjeeh detii he
 
 
 The British Wheelbarrow ROV is powered by a battery, and with the help of cameras on it, its operator is able to see the IED at a safe distance
 
 
 75 kilogram tak kaa vazan uthaane main sakasham wheelbaro aamtaur par aatankwaadiyon kii laashon ko palatney ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jo aksar kisi muthbhed main marane se turant pehle apane sharir ke neeche zindaa hand grenade rakh liya karte hai
 
 
 Later, while removing the corpses, the hand grenade explodes as soon as the security forces move the corpse of the terrorist
 
 
 lekin ab aisa nahin hota
 
 
 Now even if there is an explosion, its impact is not our military, the wheelbarrow-like ROV suffers
 
 
 iske alaava arovi chhipi hui iidi ko bhi apane maikenical panjon se khinchati hai, or inamen diserptor maikenism (disrupter mechanism) bhi laga hota he, jo darasal ek bandook jaisi chiz hoti he, jo naakaam nahin ho pai iidi ko nuksaan pahunchaa paane se pehle surakshit duuri par phenk detii he
 
 
 But despite all this, there are occasions where bomb disposal squad technicians, officers and soldiers have to go to the bomb themselves and try to thwart it by hand
 
 
 yah ek aisa behad khatarnaak kaam he, jisamen focus, kushalta or takat kii madad se hi zindagi ke saath rahakar maut ko maat di ja sakati he

 The military team that accompanies these dogs, which investigates the streets, carries a jammer in a backpack loaded on their back, allowing the remote control signals used to trigger an IED
 Can be made useless
 
 
 anya ilaakon main jamaron ko pehle se tay jagahon par tainaat kar diya jaataa he
 
 
 By the way, jammers are also used in military vehicles
 
 
 haalanki sena jamaron kii kuch khaas kshamtaaon ke bare main baat karne ke liye anicchhuk dikhi, lekin NDTV ko pataa chalaa he ki adhiktar jaimar alag-alag tarah ke kai mod main kaam kar sakate hai, jinamein 'pre-inishiation mod' bhi shaamil he, jiske tahat remote control se chalane vaali iidi ko aatankwaadiyon kii ore se signal milane se pehle sena khud hi uda sakati he
 
 
 There is only one sure way for the army to stay one step ahead of the terrorists - ensure that every radio frequency in the area is covered by jammers at all times
 
 
 prashikshan ke dauraan hamaara dekha-bhaalaa yah khel us samay puri tarah badal jaataa he, jab koi iidi mil jaataa he, or use naakaam yaa nasht kiya janaa hota he
 
 
 In the past, the bomb disposal squad used to go near the bomb and thwart it, but now our army prefers to use the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
 
 
 british wheelbaro arovi (british Wheelbarrow ROV) bydaree se chalati he, or is par lage camaron kii madad se iskaa sanchaalak iidi ko surakshit duuri par rahakar dekh paata he
 
 
 Wheelbarrows capable of weighing up to 75 kilograms are commonly used to overturn the corpses of terrorists, who often carry live hand grenades under their bodies immediately before dying in an encounter
 
 
 baad main laashon ko hataate vakt jaise hi suraksha bal aatankwaadi kii laash ko hilaate, hand grenade fat jaataa
 
 
 But now this does not happen
 
 
 ab agar visphot hota bhi he, to uskaa sara prabhaav hamaare faujee nahin, wheelbaro jaisi arovi jhelti hai
 
 
 In addition, the ROV also pulls out the hidden ieds from its mechanical claws, and also has a disrupter mechanism, which is actually a gun-like thing, which could not fail before the IED was damaged
 Throws at a distance
 
 
 lekin itnaa sab hone ke baavjood aise maukey bhi aate hai, jahaan bam-nirodhak daste ke techniciyanon, adhikariyon or phogiyon ko khud hi bam ke paas jaakar haathon se use naakaam karne kii koshish kerani padati he
 
 
 This is such a dangerous task, in which death can be defeated by living with life only with the help of focus, skill and strength
 
 
 chizon kii baarikiyon ko dekhne-samajhane, or gola-barood ko sanbhaalane kii kshamtaaon ke aadhaar par kariyar ke shuruaati daur main chune jane ke baad bam-nirodhak daste ke visheshgyon ko pune sthit college of military ejineering (college of Military Engineering) main prashikshan diya jaataa he
 
 
 These officers also participate in the Combined Officers Explosives Course - or immediately after being commissioned into the Army or within 10 years
 
 
 ek baar training mil jane ke baad inhen aatankwaad kaa saamana kar rahi uniton - jaise jammu evam kashmir main rashtriya rifles or deshbhar main tainaat vishesh counter explosive divaais unit (counter Explosive Device Units) - ke saath tainaat kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Wearing heavy protective bomb-resistant suits weighing up to 40 kilograms, these army technicians take special care of their chest, neck and head while they are lying on the ground next to the IED and looking at it
 
 
 inke paas kaam karne ke liye telescopy manipulator (telescopic manipulator) bhi hota he, jo vyakti tathaa iidi ke bich duuri banaae rakhata he, jab iidi ko chhipaai gai jagah se nikaala ja rahaa ho, lekin aakhirkaar bam ko naakaam karne ke liye maanviya anguliyaan hi zaruri hai, jo kisi aise shaks kii hon, jiskaa dimag bahut tezi se kaam karata ho
 
 
 Officers are also there to help these bomb technicians, who keep in constant contact with them over the radio
 
 
 takanisian ke helmet par lage camere kii madad se ek screen par adhikari vah sab dekhtaa rahata he, jo takanisian ko apane saamne dikhaai de rahaa he
 
 
 The comments inke liye ek-ek pal keemtee hota he
 
 
 These bomb technicians cannot work without weariness, because even though there is a system to keep them cool within their heavy suits, working continuously for more than half an hour at a time, especially in summer, would have been impossible
 is
 
 
 baharhaal, iidi ko talash karnaa or unhen naakaam karte rahanaa zindagi or maut kaa aisa kabhi nahin rukne vaala khel he, jo badalati takanic ke saath rose badalata rahata he
 
 
 These technicians of the anti-bomb squads know that if they want to keep themselves alive, they will have to succeed every time, otherwise only one success of terrorists can make them sleep forever

 20 janvari kii raat ko jis vaqt aap tivi par apana pasandida kaarykram dekhte hue raat kaa khaanaa kha rahe the thik usee vaqt dilli ke bavana industrial ilaake main teen factriyon main bheeshan aag lag gai
 In this fire many working lives became part of the list of dead due to scorching and suffocation
 mritkon main purush or mahilaayein donon shaamil hai
 Do not know who came in the fire, whose name was it? Who was from where Who was in the morning shift and who came in the night shift
 vaise bhi ye sarijankariyaana bhi jaaen to kya? jinhen janaa tha wo to chale gaye? ab jo hoga wo to zindaa logon ke bhulaave ke liye hoga
 Many pictures, many news and analysis related to this sad accident, you will read and see in the next few days
 lekin is ghatana kii ek aisi tasviir he jo aapke man ke registan main dhans jaaegi
 This picture of the incident is poignant as well as philosophical
 yah tasviir ghatana kii vyapaktaa to bataati hi he saath hi aapke bheetar ek gaharaa asar chhod jaati he
 In 2013, there was a colony in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh
 ghatana main 900 se zyaada mautein hui thim
 There is a picture of this incident in which a man and a woman are in each other's arms but not alive
 yah tasviir sthaneey photographer taslim akhtar ne lee thi
 Seeing this picture, many people of Vishwambhar had linked themselves to that incident
 photo credit-taslim akhtar / nydailynewstika aisi hi ek tasviir is agnikand se bhi ai he, lekin is tasviir main do auraten hai
 They are holding each other
 lekin donon buree tarah se jal chuke hai, jhulas chuke hai
 Simultaneously death took them from this world
 sambhav ho jab aag kii lapten pehali baar dikhi hongi to unhone apni jaan bachaane kii koshish kii hogi lekin jab lakh koshishon ke baad asafal hui hongi to ek duusare ko yun pakad liya hoga
 We got this picture before midnight and when we saw it, it was hardly done
 kai tarah ke khyaal dimag main, man main aae
 At first, what will be his name for so long? Where will these two be from? When will you come to Delhi? There will be a relationship or because of fear, both of them must have held each other tightly
 kai baar dar bhi rishte bana detaa he
 Whenever a question came, then i saw this picture
 shaayad ummid thi ki mere sawaalon ke jawaab is tasviir se hi mil jaaenge, lekin aisa hona kahaan tha
 Well finally i came to the conclusion that there were two working women
 din-raat saath main mehnat karti hongi, khaanaa khate hue, ghar-parivaar ke kisse batiyaati hongi or is nishthur shahar main apana or apane parivaar kaa pet paalane kii koshish kar rahi hongi
 What is there in the name and address ye sab to amiron ke banaae niyam hai
 Why should they be tied in this rule? saath raheen, saath kaam kiya,mehnat-mazaduribhi saath-saath karti thim or aaj jab maut ai to maut se kaha hoga: ham saheliyaan hai
 Hard working ladies, if you want to take it then take it along
 maut ne unki baat maan lee or unhen le gai

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav retaliated on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and launched one attack after another on Tuesday
 lalu ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne argedy ko dhokhaa diya
 There was a nexus between Nitish Kumar and the BJP to break the grand alliance and form the government in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi kii madad se mere khilaaf maamle shuru karaane kii sajeesh kii
 10 big things about Lalu's counterattack on Nitish
 
 
 -lalu prasad yadav ne nitish kumaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha kinitish kumarako raajnneeti kaa palaturam kahana chahie
 He used to get me sandalwood, but as soon as he got a chance to do politics, he turned back
 -lalu ne kaha ki nitish kumaar mere beton kii bali dena chahta tha
 Targeting Nitish, Lalu said that he is a leader of a particular society, not of the month
 yahi vajah he ki wo 1994 main hue kurmi sammelan main mere khilaaf raajnneeti karne gandhi maidan gaye the
 -lalu said that we contested and won the 1970–71 student union in the university
 hamaari lokapriyata nitish kumaar se pehle kii he or ham unke senior hai
 We brought forward Nitishji during the JP movement
 hamane nitish ko aage laane ke liye bahut kuch kiya
 Laloo Yadav said on the alliance with Nitish Kumar that i had said that if i had to drink poison even to remove those who hate politics, i will drink
 mulaayam singh ji kehane par maine gathbandhan karne kaa faisla liya or nitish khud chalakar hamaare yahaan aae the
 Laloo said that Nitish says that i got Lalu a vote, but the reality is that he has been able to make himself stand in politics with my help
 main khud waisi jagah gaya jahaan sirf or sirf meri entry thi aise main nitish mujhe kaise chunaav jitwa sakate hai
 - i told Nitish ji that we are old, give these children a term
 tejasvi yadav ne acha kaam kiya or nitish uski lokapriyata se ghabara gaye
 Due to this nervousness, they have separated from the Grand Alliance
 -nitish kumaar ne jithan ram maanjhi ko kathputli mukhyamantri banaaya tha, lekin jab yah kathputli bolne lagi to nitish kumaar ne unhen hataa diya
 i know Nitish's political character very well
 -nitish kumaar tum bhul gaye ki tumhaari haisiyat kya thi
 We won by over 3 lakh votes in Chapra, at that time you were a student leader
 nitish do-do baar vidhansabha chunaav haare or loksabhaa bhi haare
 Lalu said that Nitish ji, after losing the election, came to me with folded hands
 -nitish kumaar bijepi se alag hokar jaanate the ki wo akele chunaav nahin jeet sakate hai
 Nitish ji, after losing the election you came to me with folded hands
 nitish kumaar tum bhul gaye ki tumhaari haisiyat kya thi
 Nitish Kumar has been greedy for power
 maine hameshaa nitish kumaar ko bachaaya he
 Laloo said that Nitish does not let the poor come to his house
 unhen garibon se milanaa julna pansad nahin he
 That is why he could never become the leader of the poor

 They will have to secure a place in the final to book a Rio ticket based on the available quota
 matlab, ye bhi rio ke liye qolifaai karne se ek kadam kii duuri par hai
 Vikas Krishna made it to the last 8 players in the 75 kg category beating Georgia's Vachtadze trap 3–0

 Apart from these, Devendro Singh has reached the semi-finals in the 49kg category
 unhen uplabdh kota ke aadhaar par rio kaa tikat book karaane ke liye final main jagah pakki kerani hogi
 Meaning, they are also one step away from qualifying for Rio
 vikaas krishna ne 75 kilogram varg main georgia ke vachatadze jaal ko 3-0 se haraakar aakiri 8 khilaadiyon main jagah bana lee he
 For India, where only Shiva Thapa has confirmed Rio ticket in just 56 kg category, then 400 boxers from 100 countries are participating in this tournament to get around 39 Kota place

 However, the PM sought some time to end the complexity of the issue
 tippaniyan It is worth mentioning that this issue was also a part of bjp's election manifesto and now more than a year has passed to the government and ex-servicemen are becoming restless if nothing happens
 purv sainikon kii is maang kaa samarthan congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi kar chuke hai or vah in sainikon se mil bhi chuke hai
 This demand of ex-servicemen and movement in support of it has been going on for almost 33 years
 bataa den ki duusare kaarykaal main upie sarkaar ne antim dinon main is maang ko maan liya tha or 500 karod rupee iske liye sweekrut kiye the

 The letter comes ahead of a Sunday rally by another group of former army personnel on the issue
 akhil bhartiya purv sainik seva parishad ne kaha ki van rank, van pension ek jwalanth or bhaavnaatmak mudda he
 It is worth noting that Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and Army Chief Dalbir Singh Suhag and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had themselves agreed on One Rank nor Pension in the Mann Ki Baat program
 lekin, piem ne is mudde kii jatilta ko samaapt karne ke liye kuch vakt maanga tha

 Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has said that he has been assured by Pakistan's High Commissioner Abdul Basit that no dialogue with India can take place without Kashmir
 pakistan ucchayog main yojit id milan samaaroh main shaamil hone aae mirwiz ne abdul basit se band kamare main mulaaqaat ke baad ye baat kahi
 It is to be known that only after the meeting of the Hurriyat leaders with the Pakistan High Commissioner, the Modi government canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks with the neighboring country in August last year

 The comments id milan ke is samaaroh main syed ali shah gilaani ko bhi nimantran bheja gaya tha, lekin ve isamen shaamil nahin hue
 Mirwaiz, stating the reason behind this, said that the joint statement issued after the meeting of the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Ufa did not mention the Kashmir problem, due to which many Hurriyat leaders are angry, so they did not join it
 band kamare main hui baatcheet main mirwiz ne pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ke saamne ye mudda uthaaya or uske baad hi ucchayukta kii taraf se ye bharosa diya gaya
 According to Mirwaiz, Basit also made it clear to him that the shared statement was based on the issues raised in the Prime Ministers' meeting and not on all issues between India and Pakistan

 Mirwaiz, who came to attend the Eid Milan ceremony held at the Pakistan High Commission, said this after a closed-door meeting with Abdul Basit
 gyaat ho ki hurriyat netaaon se paak ucchayukta kii mulaaqaat ke baad hi modi sarkaar ne pichley saal agast main padosi mulk ke saath hone vaali videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet ko radd kar diya tha
 According to the consensus reached in Ufa, the meeting of the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan is to be held in Delhi
 mirwiz ko isse koi etraz nahin ki pakistan ke enese sartaaj ajeez bhartiya enese ajit dobhaal se mulaaqaat se pehle hurriyat leaders se milte hai yaa baad main
 They believe that the Kashmir problem can be solved only after better relations between India and Pakistan
 tippaniyan An invitation was also sent to Syed Ali Shah Geelani for this ceremony of Eid Milan, but he did not attend
 mirwiz ne iske peeche vajah bataate hue kaha ki ufaa main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon kii mulaaqaat ke baad jari saajha bayaan main kashmir samasya kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya, jisase hurriyat ke kai netaa naaraaz hai, isliye ve isamen shaamil nahin hue
 In a closed-door conversation, Mirwaiz raised the issue with Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit and only after that was the trust given by the High Commissioner
 mirwiz ke mutabiq basit ne unhen ye bhi saaf kiya ki saajha bayaan pradhanmantriyon kii meeting main uthe muddon par aadhaarit tha na ki bharat or pakistan ke bich ke tamaam muddon ko samete
 It is to be known that only after the meeting of the Hurriyat leaders with the Pakistan High Commissioner, the Modi government canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks with the neighboring country in August last year
