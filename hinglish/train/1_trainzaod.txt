 Shukla said, 'the post of IPL chief is for one year which is renewed every year at the annual general meeting but i have no desire to continue in this position for the third year
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe bisisiai main kisi pad kii laalasaa nahin he, meraa kaam maichon kaa aayojan tha or match kaaphi acchhee tarah yojit hue
 Despite the controversies, the stadiums were packed

 doosraa suzav he, jise maine pehle hi sweekaar liya he ki bhrashtachar rodhi evam suraksha ikai ke ek adhikari ko toornament ke dauraan prayek team ke saath shaamil kar dena chahie kyonki vah ek galat khilaadi ko pahchaanane main kaamyaab hoga
 'shukla said,' The third suggestion is that whoever is caught, should be punished severely according to the law
 isse unhen sabak milegaa
 The final is that there should be a provision in the players' contract that if anyone is found involved in corruption, he should be criminally prosecuted

 The results of its investigation should not be referred to the BCCI Working Committee
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jahaan tak shrinivasana kaa sawaal he to hamaara najariya he ki jaanch lambit rahane tak unhen khud ko puri prakriya se alag kar dena chahie

 ) Hindon Canal Road near Delhi border in Ghaziabad was jammed for hours on Monday afternoon
 jam se logon ko kaaphi pareshaani hui
 When the Ghaziabad traffic police was told about this jam, a strange reply came from them
 trephic police kaa kahana tha ki trephic kaa atyadhik dabaav hone kii vajah se yatayaat dhimaa he
 It was past 12 in the afternoon
 vasundhara se noida jane valihindon canal rodpar trephic aam dinon kii tarah saamaanya tha
 But there was traffic on the cuts at St
 Thomas School and St
 Francis School
 aage badhane par enech-24 ke neech kareeb do kilometre tak trephic jam tha
 No policemen were seen by the traffic police
 maine maukey se kuch tasviren leen or gajiabad trephic police ko tag karte hue poocha ki is vakt jabakitraphicabilkul saamaanya rahata he, aisi sthiti kyon? haalanki mere twit par gajiabad trephic police ne twarit pratikriya di lekin unka jawaab dekhakar main hairaan rah gaya
 The answer was that the yatra is going slow due to high traffic pressure
 Why this # Mahajaamon canal road towards Ghazipur, delhi@gzbtrafficpolpic

 High traffic pressure and that too after 12 noon
 aakhir aisi koun si baat thi jisase yatayaat kaa adhik dabaav ho gaya tha
 If the pressure was high then it is also the job of the traffic police to manage it, which was nowhere to be seen
 enech-24 par bhi trephic kaa yahi haal tha
 @ranjitksingh sir, the yatra is going slow due to high traffic pressure
 - Gzb Traffic police (@gzbtrafficpol) September 5, 2016 Troubled by traffic police 'slow traffic' reply, i again tweeted with another photo This is called slow traffic, where it is difficult to walk half a kilometer in half an hour
 kai log to sadak kinare apane vaahan khadey kar aaraam karne lage the
 The answer that came to my question was even more surprising
 is baar police ne mana ki jam jaisi sthiti utpann ho rahi he
 But the reason given is the diversion

 - Gzb Traffic police (@gzbtrafficpol) September 5, 2016 The big question is that the public does not know any reason for root diversion

 8 march or 13 march ko hone vaali kendriya chunaav samiti kii baithak main rajya se zyaadaatar ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 It is believed that the party president Rajnath Singh will contest from Lucknow instead of Ghaziabad, but the picture of Narendra Modi's candidature from Benaras is not clear yet
 rajya bijepi ke adhikansh netaa chaahate hai ki modi banaras yaa lakhanu se chunaav maidan main utren
 With Rajnath deciding to go to Lucknow, now the seat of Benares remains for Modi
 udhar, bihar bijepi ke netaa chaahate hai ki modi patna se chunaav maidan main utren, lekin unka kahana he ki agar modi banaras se bhi ladate hai, to bihar ke kai hisson main iskaa asar hoga or bijepi ko majbootee milegi
 BJP strategists believe that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra are the most important states in this election
 upi-bihar main bijepi kaa acha pradarshan ho, iske liye jaruri he ki modi upi se chunaav laden
 Amit Shah has said this openly
 banaras se philhal murali manohar joshi party ke saansad hai or vah apni seat chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 But the party says that if Modi decides to contest from Banaras, Joshi will be persuaded to contest from Kanpur
 vahiin, gujarat bijepi saaf kar chuki he ki modi ko rajya se ladanaa hi hoga
 He feels that this is very important for his 'mission 26'
 sutron ke mutabik khud narendra modi bhi chaahate hai ki gujarat se bijepi is baar loksabhaa kii sabase zyada siten jeeten
 Ahmedabad East or Vadodara's name has been suggested for Modi
 bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki modi upi se laden yaa na laden, lekin gujarat se har haalat main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladenge
 So the question arises whether Modi will fight from one seat or from two seats? It is not new to contest from two seats
 khud indira gandhi do loksabhaa siton se chunaav lard chuki hai, lekin sanvaidhanik baadhyataa he ki koi vyakti ek hi seat se loksabhaa kaa sadsy rah saktaa he
 That is, if he wins both seats, he will have to resign from one seat
 isiilie poocha ja rahaa he ki modi agar upi or gujarat donon jagah se khadey hote hai, to vah donon jagah se jeetne kii sthiti main koun si seat se istipha denge? The Aam Aadmi Party has indicated that its leader Arvind Kejriwal may contest against Narendra Modi from Benares
 vishleshkon ke mutabik aisa hone par congress, espi-bispi jaise virdohi dal kejariwal ko samarthan dekar modi kaa muqabla kathin banane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 It is also believed that after this, Kejriwal will get tremendous publicity and due to this his party will be seen in many seats in other parts of the country
 lekin bijepi ke ranneetikaar kejariwal ke chunaav ladane kii sambhaavna ko zyada tarjeeh nahin dete hai
 He believes that Arvind Kejriwal will not miss any opportunity to make headlines and it is not necessary that Modi should not only stand against him from there only when he contested from Gujarat, but Modi should contest from anywhere, Kejriwal will fight against him
 Can
 isliye kejariwal ke chunaav ladane kii sambhaavna yaa uske ganit ke hisaab se bijepi apana faisla nahin kar sakati he
 Ultimately, it has been decided in the party that Narendra Modi himself should take the final decision in this regard
 vahi tay karen ki vah ek seat se ladenge yaa do se
 Or will he fight only from Gujarat or UP
 itnaa tay he ki modi is bare main jo bhi faisla karenge, vah chunavi laabh or nuksaan ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi kiya jayega na ki bijepi ke andruni samikarnon ko durust karne ke liye, jaisaa ki party kaa ek dhada chahta he
 There is a possibility that the party will announce Modi's candidature at the very end
 maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke bete or vidhayak nitesh rane dwaara dipti ejeeniyar par keechad phenke jane ke maamle par siyaasi waar-palatwaar kaa silsilaa thamata najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Now, a video of Chandrakant Dada Patil, Minister of Revenue and Public Works Department of the state is going viral, in which he is seen saying that in the case of beating the deputy engineer, he sued the Superintendent of Police of Sindhudurg against MLA Rane for attempted murder
 Was asked to register
 patil isi video main yah bhi kehete hai ki purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ne phone kar apane vidhayak bete ko bachaane kii vinati kii
 He is also saying that immediately after getting information about this incident, he had called the Sindhudurg Superintendent of Police and got information about the incident
 gauratlab he ki mantri patil ne haal hi main pune main peedit dipti ejeeniyar ke parijanon se mulaakaat kii thi
 He had assured the deputy engineer's family that their safety would be ensured
 gauratlab he ki kankavadi se vidhayak rane or unke samarthakon ne 4 july ko abhiyantaa ko keechad se nahalaane ke saath hi pul se baandh diya tha
 The engineer had lodged a complaint in this regard at the Kankavali police station, on which the MLA had surrendered to the police station
 vidhayak rane or unke 16 saathi philhal 9 july tak police hiraasat main hai
 10 cases have been registered against them, including obstruction of government work
 bataa den ki rane congress ke tikat par vidhayak nirvaachit hue the
 Rane broke away from the Congress to form his own party self-respecting organization
 vah apni party ke kaaryakartaaon or meyar samir nalkhade ke saath mumbai-goa haive kaa muyna karne nikle the
 In Kankavali, Nitesh Rane found potholes on the road, which had mud
 isse gussaye vidhayak ne abhiyantaa ko keechad se nahalaane ke saath hi pul se baandh diya tha

 Jammu and Kashmir cricketer Parvez Rasool did not find a place in the playing XI in the fifth and final ODI against Zimbabwe
 25 saal ke parvej rasul is daure par team india ke eklaute khilaadi ban gaye hai, jinhen ek bhi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila
 Many young players were included in Team India on this entire tour, so that India gets a chance to try out its bench strength
 paanch van-de match kii siries jab ne bharat 3−0 se jeeta, to laga ki baaki ke bache do maichon main team india apane yuva khilaadiyon ko mauka degi
 But this did not happen
 team ke baaki khilaadiyon ko ekaadh match khilne ke maukey to mili, lekin parvej rasul ko ek bhi mauka nahin mila
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has questioned the non-feeding of Rasool
 unhone twit kiya ki kya rasul ko zimbabwe sirf isliye le jaaya gaya ki uskaa manobal giraaya jaae
 
 
 This work could have been done easily in the country as well
 
 
 tippaniyan Minister of State for Human Resources Shashi Tharoor has also supported Omar Abdullah in this matter
 tharur ne twit kiya ki parvej rasul ke aaj na khilne se bahut niraashaa hui
 Odd choice
 jadeja or raina kii jagah rasul or rahane ko aaraam se mauqaa diya ja saktaa tha
 He wrote another tweet in which he said, what is the benefit of going ahead 4–0, if you can not allow every member to play once by altering the team on tour
 khel patrkaar ayaaj memon bhi rasul ke saath khadey hai
 He also tweeted that not giving chance to Parvez Rasool is a harsh decision
 iske peeche kya daleel he flechar or viraat

 As far as Haryana is concerned, till now, Kamal Nath was looking after the responsibility as the general secretary in charge of this state from the central command of the Congress
 unke madhya pradesh congress cameti kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad haryana ke liye nae rajya prabharee ke taur par party alaakaman ko ghoshnaa kerani he
 There will be a change in PCC (pradesh Congress Committee), including electing the new Chief of the State Congress Committee in Haryana, keeping watch on the jat-dalit equation

 The Congress is considering prioritizing the Haryana jat-dalit equation
 sutron ne bataaya ki party kaa maananaa he ki haryana main jat pradesh congress adhyaksh laane se bijepi ko ‘jat banaam anya 35 birdari’ kaa card khilne kaa mauka mil jayega
 Their pair in MP, Rajasthan and Haryana told, 'just as the party wants to move forward through the pair of Kamal nath-jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, Ashok gehlot-sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, in the same way as Bhupendra Singh hooda-kumari Selja in Haryana

 *** Lord Hanuman is constantly in discussion these days in the country and the topic of his discussion is about his caste
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hanuman ko dalit bataaya tha, iske baad unke jati ko lekar raajnneetik bayaanbaji shuru ho gai he
 Some are calling them Dalits, some Muslims and some are referring to them as Jats, but now MP Kirti Azad has told them to be Chinese

 Everywhere there is a rumor that Chinese people are claiming that Hanuman ji was Chinese
 ' vahiin, bijepi saansad udit raaj ne hanuman ko adivasee bataaya
 BJP leaders have been on a wide range of rhetoric about Hanuman's caste
 uttar pradesh ke dharmarth kaary mantri lakshmi narayan choudhary ne vidhaan parishad main bahes ke dauraan hanuman ko jat bataa diya
 He had said, 'those who jump on seeing others in trouble, can only be Jats
 isliye hanuman jat the
 However, listening to his plea, the opposition parties sitting in the house started creating a ruckus
 bukkal bole- musalmaan the hanumanisse pehle bijepi vidhayak bukkal nawab ne bhihanuman kii jaatiko lekar anokhaa bayaan diya tha
 He said that Hanuman was a Muslim
 isliye musalamaanon ke naam rahamaan, ramajaan, farhaan, suleman, salmaan, jishaan, qurbaan par rakhe jate hai
 BJP MLA Bukkal Nawab referred to the controversy over Hanuman being called a Dalit and said that there is talk about Hanuman's caste
 to yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki wo kis dharm se the
 i believe that Hanuman was a Muslim
 isliye musalamaanon ke andar jo naam rakhaa jaataa he, wo hanuman se miltaa-julata he
 The first statement about Hanuman's caste was given by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in which he described Hanuman as a Dalit during a speech at an election rally in Alwar on 27 November
 unhone kaha tha ki hanuman vanavaasi, vanchit or dalit the
 After his statement, fierce opposition started in the political corridors
 yogi adityanathke is bayaan ke baad har koi apane-apane str par hanuman kii jati bataane laga
 National Scheduled Tribes Commission (NCST) chairman Nand Kumar Sai called Hanuman a tribal
 jabaki baba ramdev ne bataaya ki hanuman asht siddhi ke gyani hone ke saath-saath kshatriya bhi hai
 While Union Minister Satyapal Songha called Hanuman not a Dalit, Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati called him a Brahmin
 bijepi netaa or rajyasabha saansad gopal narayan singh ne to yah tak kah diya ki hanuman to bandar the or bandar pashu hota he, jiskaa darja dalit se bhi neeche hota he

 is nazar se aap sanyukt raashtra or saarc ke bich pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashanon kii yatra ko bhi dekh sakate hai
 His speech at the SAARC conference today was much better and more mature than the art of submission at the United Nations Conference
 pradhanmantri ke videsh dauron kii aalochana karne vaale bhi aaj unke bhaashan kii bhaavana main saarc kshetra ke liye vyaavhaarik sambhaavnaaen dekh sakate hai
 Today's speech has brought the SAARC, which has disappeared from the ideological debates, back to the center
 main kootnithik or in videshi manchon kii upyogita ko andeh kii nazar se dekhtaa hum
 There is a big reason that i have never had any connection with these issues
 aisa nahin he ki ye tamaam manch naakaara hai, balki kai baar lagata he ki yahaan boli jane vaali baaten adarsh rup main to bahut acchhee hoti he, lekin unka koi khaas gunatmak asar nahin hota
 Editorials are filled with these speeches, but nothing changes on the ground
 apni is sandehatmakataa ko sweekaar karne ke baavjood main maanata hum ki pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan acha tha
 i do not know the past and the future, so i am writing this as a running commentary
 pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan kam se kam ek vaicharik sthapana ke lihaaz se prasthaan bindu to pesh karata hi he
 i do not know if any of the earlier speakers have expressed these feelings or not, and what happened to them, but when the Prime Minister was speaking, the cameras on the faces of the people sitting in the hall showed a lot
 ek kism kii sakaaraatmakataa bhari hui thi
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was also stunned! Two of his colleagues sitting behind the Prime Minister of Nepal on the stage also had a special look on their faces
 vah apni baton se bharat ko mukhiya nahin bana rahe the, balki yahi kah rahe the ki ab takaraav bahut ho chukaa, milakar kuch kaam karte hai
 The speech ended in the style of the familiar jumlebuzzy of the Prime Minister that we are close together but not together
 saath hone se kai guna takat bad jaati he
 With such jumlas, they draw the picture of possibilities in the common people
 lekin is bhaashan kaa shuru kaa hissaa bhi kaaphi acha tha
 i am not talking about routine discourses on fighting terrorism and its risks
 baat kar rahaa hum us mritpraaya saarc main phir se jaan daal dene vaale hisse kii
 Prime Minister Modi wants to make SAARC an area of opportunity
 vah in ilaakon ko jod dena chaahate hai
 To do this, he is not only giving speeches to others, but is also counting India's weakness
 inhen sab baton ke kaaran bhaashan main eemaandaaree kaa paksh ubharne lagata he
 Modi says that when i talk about going to Janakpur via road, there is panic among the officers
 vah isliye ki seemaa par sadaken behad kharaab hai
 i want them to get better
 main seemaa par suvidhaon ko behatar karnaa chahta hum, taaki kaarobaar ko raftaar mil sake
 In doing so, the Prime Minister very carefully transforms the relations of SAARC countries into producers and consumers
 seemaa vivaad ke kaaran saarc deshon ke nagarikon ke kadave sambandhon ko utpaadak or upabhokta main badalakar kehete hai ki kya produsar or kanjumar ke bich duuri kam nahin ho sakati he
 Modi's nationalism is businessism
 dhandha karo or dhandha karne kii sabhi suvidhaon ko thik se uplabdh karaao
 This will lead to employment and all will be well
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki bharat ke bheetar bhi or kai baar bharat or pakistan ke punjab ke bich koi maal itani duuri tay kar letaa he ki vah na sirf mahangaa bhi ho jaataa he, balki samay bhi bahut le letaa he
 But this distance will be overcome only when the Prime Minister, under the pressure of political impatience, will not stop talking with Pakistan
 in sambandhon ko behatar karne ke liye shart mukt maahaul main baatcheet kii mez par le janaa hoga
 If it were easy, the Prime Minister himself would have taken the initiative in this conference and filled Nawaz Sharif in the arms
 seemaa par sadak ban jane bhar se sambandh behatar nahin ho jate, balki andeh ke kaaran bhi paidaa ho jate hai
 After such a good speech, Modi, under pressure from the Sangh and the opposition parties, should have given a treat to Pakistan as he had given during his swearing-in ceremony
 varna modi, na nawaz sharif, donon main se koi bhi apane gharelu raajnneetik yatharth se mukt nahin ho paaegaa
 The Prime Minister also told the SAARC countries that they know that India has the upper hand in trade with you
 trade sarplus bharat ke paksh main he, lekin yah chal nahin saktaa
 There should be balance in business
 aisa kahkar vah saarc deshon ko vishwaas kaa ek dhaagaa to pakadaa hi dete hai ki kam se kam in rishton ko ek nayaa mauka to diya hi ja saktaa he
 He says that today there is a need to ask ourselves where in the world is South Asia
 ham ek duusare ko andeh or nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen
 The dream that i see for India, i see for the whole region
 padosi acha ho, yah puri duniya kii chahat he
 Overall, Modi has shrugged off the SAARC countries that if we connect with each other like Europe, trade and people will increase, then SAARC will become an area of potential

 garajte badalon ke saath ho rahi ghanghor barish main khachaakhach bhari bas main baithkar main kannauj kii ore bad rahi thi or meri yaaden bachapan kii ore bhaag rahi thim
 a sound began to echo in my ears
 har shaam gale main itr kii shishiyon kaa bada-sa baksaa taange pheri lagaate itravaale kii aawaaj
 He would often come to my grandmother's house
 meri daadi badalte mausam ke mutabik usase itr kharida karti thim or kahatee ki yaadon kaa naata sabase zyada gandh se judaa hota he
 The perfume would present before us several samples of fragrance by dipping finely woven cotton wool into perfumes placed in various crystal vials
 khushboo main bhiige ve lamhe hamen apane jaadu main baandh lete
 Some of them have a very special fragrance of perfume as if still wrapped in breath
 achaanak bas ke horn kii karkash aawaaj ne meri tandra bhang kar di
 When i looked out of the window, the clouds were roasting heavily
 bas ne mujhe mukhya sadak par utaar diya or dijal ke dhuen or keechad ke bich chhodkar aage nikal gai
 Kannauj is a place where there is not much to see from the top, but this place has a lot of attraction for people of investigative health
 ganga tat par basaa kannauj harshavardhan ke samrajya kii rajdhani tha
 The perfume business was flourishing here
 kannauj ko itr ke aswan (distilation) or banane kaa tarika faras se mila tha
 Today, while most of the old cities have broken away from their roots and worn a new one, this city of perfumes has kept the ancient art of perfume making with its heart even today and i am looking for the secret of the same art in this city
 i have come maine ek rickshaw vaale ko aawaaj di or trephic ke janjaal se nikalakar puraane shahar ke mukhya ilaake kii ore chal padi
 In a few minutes, the pages of the glorious past of this ancient city opened in front of me - old sandalwood distillery, old perfume shops and ancient temples
 main pragati aroma distilleri ke pushparaj jain kii mehmaan thi, jinka parivaar pichhali saat peedhishon se itr ke kaarobaar main laga hua he
 He drove me to his distillery, where the traditional method of hydro distillation is still used today to make perfumes
 tambe ke bade se kadahon or bans se bani pipon ke jariye attar or hydrosol (gulab jal, kewda jal) taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Jains are completely devoted to their art
 unhone bataaya ki top, middle or base nots vidhi se banaae gaye aadhunik jamaane ke parafum se ulat paaramparik tareeke se itr banaate samay yah dhyaan dena jaruri hota he ki 'chandan kii lakdi yaa til ke tel ko milaane par’ phool yaa lakdi ke arq kaa baraabar mishran taiyaar hokannauj main 250 se zyada itrghar hai, jinamein se kai tut-foot rahe hai
 At first glance, it seems that the whole of Kannauj is engaged in some form of perfume
 taaje tode gaye phulon kii chantai karte, sahi maap main pani or tel milaate, khaas taapmaana tay karte or arq ikattha karte prashikshit haath (or naak!) barabas aapkaa dhyaan apni ore khinch lete hai
 The secret of making perfumes inside the high walls, hidden in its silence, surprises the transformation of this city into a noisy market
 vijay market kii gahamagahami ke bich se guzarane par shahar kaa badla hua cheharaa dikhaai detaa he
 Everywhere there are fragrant oils, fragrant goods, fine incense sticks and perfume shops
 kannauj kii saji-dhaji dukaanon, chakkar lagaate pheriwaalon or street food ke stall se bhari sadakon se badi mushkil se khud ko alag kar, bheed se bachate-bachaate main itr kii ek puraani dukaan par pahunchi, jahaan dhanie, gali main pade gobar or bagal kii mithai kii dukaan se aane vaali vibhinn gandhon ke mail se hawa main ek ajeeb mahak bhari hui thi
 Radha Saran was sitting among his stock
 main unke saamne ghutanon ke bal baith gai or unase itr kii vibhinn kismon ke bare main poochne lagi
 He looked like a philosopher while speaking in an old-fashioned style and a loud voice, "the secret of my youth is this perfume
" ye yaaddaasht ko jagaae rakhte hai
 "he took out a few bottles from an old box and asked me to smell the perfume in them
 unamem barish kii mahak thi
 The slight fragrance of sandalwood wrapped with earthy smell is one of the most intoxicating fragrances and no wonder it sells the best
 main vibhinn itr or loshnon ko apane haath par lagaakar unki sugandh kaa anand le rahi thi
 Meanwhile, a large glass of fresh thick lassi was offered to me from the adjacent sweet shop, which smelled of rose water

 Kannauj is very famous for this
 is shahar main or bhi khaas chijen hai
 Remnants of the historic mausoleum built under the rule of Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur, from where the entire city is visible

 The colors of the graffiti carved on them have started to fade, yet their beauty is still in full swing

 bachche bhi the, jo nadi main pathar phenkakar majaa le rahe the or main nadi kii laharon kaa sangeet sunne main magn thi
 The journey of the sun on the horizon was complete

 Addressing public meetings in Banihal and Ramban assembly constituencies of Jammu region, he said, 'bjp's 44 plus electoral program will be proved in the assembly elections
 jammu-kashmir kaa aglaa mukhyamantri hamaari party kaa hoga
 He criticized the 60-year dynastic movement of the Congress and stressed that the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir will remove all these diseases of dynastic rule
 unhone kaha, ham vanshavaad ko khatm karne ke liye patibaddh hai taaki rajya main pragati or vikaas kaa yug shuru kiya ja sake

 However, both Salman and Yulia have described themselves as good friends of each other

 Now, recently, Salman has gifted Yulia one of his sketches

 Many funny comments have also been posted on Scratch from the fans of both Yulia and Salman

 Yulianne has not clearly mentioned in her post that this painting has been gifted to her by Salman Khan, but it is clear from Salman's signature below the painting that this painting has been made by Salman
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki salmaan khan ko painting karnaa behad pasand hai or wo samay-samay par apane ajij doston ko tohfe ke taur par painting gift karte rahete hai
 Perhaps this gift of Salman for Julia is a look of his love? For a second try to see yourself through the eyes of a stranger, your loved one and an old friend # different # perspective # stillu # complex # uareadiamond # sketch # me # i # It # a photo posted by Iulia Vantur Official Account (@vanturiulia) onaug 4, 2016 at 10:08 am PDT maine 1966 main jab wipro kii jimmedaari sanbhali, tab kaarobaar ke kaamkaaj kaa mujhe koi tajurba nahin tha
 i was 21 years old and Banisbatan returned from Stanford leaving his degree incomplete after the tragedy of the death of his father who passed away at a young age
 wipro main shuruaati kuch saal kashmakash main daalane vaale the
 Everything was new and had to be learned
 meri madad or sahare ke liye kai achche log the, par aakhirkaar jimmedaari to meri hi thi or maine ise bahut shiddat se mahasoos bhi kiya
 i learned most by going on the streets with sales people
 ham dukaan-dukaan jaaya karte or dukandaaron ko hamaara vanaspati tel rakhane ke liye raji karte, jo us jamaane main ham banaaya karte the
 This gave me an intimate perspective from the human to economic aspects of the industry
 isane mujhe yah bhi sikhaaya ki hamaara sanghathan utana hi acha he jitne hamaare cells ke log achche hai
 He was our most important people
 maine yah bhi siikhaa ki cells kaa kaam kitna pechida he
 For this, hard work and ability are necessary
 yah vah sabak tha jo maine dekha ki har jagah khara utarataa he
 Exactly 17 years ago, when we started the foundation and started working with government schools, i had no idea about the training
 lekin main itnaa jaanata tha ki seekhney kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki jaao or aage kii qatari main khadey logon ke saath vakt guzaaro
 In this case these people in the front row were teachers and principals
 maine in barason main baqayada yah kiya he or aise harek maamle main mujhe is baat kii jhalak mili ki shikshak kii bhoomika or uski chunautiyaan kitne gaiyr-maamuli dhang se pechida hai
 Come to describe it, i will tell you the experience of a special journey
 rajasthan ke barmer jile kaa meraa safar kabhi na bhuulane vaala tajurba tha
 During lunch in a school, the head teacher insisted on pouring a spoon of ghee on millet bread
 khud apni pahal par unhone kaha, "is ghi ko lekar aap tajjub kar rahe honge
 "and then he explained
 skool main 265 vidhyaarthee hai
 Mid-day meal provides the same amount of grain, which is determined by each child
 magar kisi bhi din paanch se 10 bachche skool se gaiyrhaazir hote hai
 He would ensure that the right amount of food was cooked and would save the food grains of the non-attending students
 kuch hafton main ve itnaa bachaa lete hai ki gaanv kii kiraane kii dukaan se uske badale main kuch ghi or mithaiyaan le aate hai
 And this is what they give to the students
 saaf he ki mid-de mile ke liye desh bhar ke tamaam skulon main sarkaar kii taraf se or bahut zyada rakam kii jarurat he taaki poshak saamagree ko badhaayaa ja sake
 But the best that can be done in the current situation is that these teachers do
 yahi vah ghi tha, jisamen se kuch ve skool ke mehmaanon ke saath baant rahe the
 The understanding of the head teacher was also reflected in many other things
 inamen vah bal mela bhi tha jisaki mejabani unka skool karata tha or jahaan ve gaye the
 The objective of the event was to create awareness among teachers of nearby schools about effective methods of teaching arts
 bal meley ke liye shaikshanik vichaaron ko shikshakon ko aakarshith karne vaale asardaar or dilachasp tantra main badalane kii salaahiyat jaruri thi
 He was not only smart and expert but also true and honest and equipped with solid academic understanding
 ve prerana se otprot paanch shikshakon kii aguai kar rahe the
 The result was a school where the children were happy and learning well
 samudaay ko bhi is skool par behad garv tha
 This was despite the complex challenges the school was facing
 zyaadaatar bachche apane-apane gharon main behad garibi se dochaar the, kisi tarah skool aa pate the, paanch shikshak nau kaa kaam sambhaal rahe the, vagairah-vagairah
 i stayed in Barmer district for three days
 vahaan main 200 se zyada skool adhyapakon se mila
 His commitment, dedication and honesty were heart touching
 khaskar unhen jin mushkil halaat or majaburiyon main kaam karnaa pad rahaa tha, usko dekhte hue to or bhi
 This is what i have seen in successive districts across the country
 shikshakon kaa ek khaasaa bada hissaa he jo vibhinn kamiyon or chunautiyon ke baavjood khud apni pahal or samajhadaari se gajab kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 There is also a large proportion of such teachers, who do a good job at getting help and the right environment
 vahiin ek chota-sa hissaa laaparvaah or udasin he
 It is not very different from large organizations in businesses or other sectors
 iskaa matlab he ki desh bhar main faile nabbe lakh shikshakon main se lakhon shikshak eemaandaar or patibaddh hai
 We need good curriculum, infrastructure and administration
 magar shikshak hi shiksha ke morche par agali qatari ke asal senaanee hai
 And good and committed teachers are making a big difference, despite many other things going against them
 yahi vah agali qatari he jo hamaari shiksha kii kamyaabi tay karegi or yah shiksha hi he jo hamaare samaaj ko gadhati he
 But during the last decades we have underestimated teachers and invested less in them
 agar itani hi ahmiyat ham apane shikshakon ko dete hai, to shiksha bhala acchhee kaise ho sakati he?agar ham apni shiksha main sudhaar laana chaahate hai, to hamaare shikshakon kii khatir kai tarah ke upaay bahut jaruri hai or inhen fouran anjaam dene kii jarurat he
 i will mention only three here
 pehla, shikshakon ko shikshit karne kii hamaari pranali kaa sampurna kayapalat karne kii jarurat he
 This system b
 aid
 Prepares our teachers through programs
 bi
 Ed
 collejon kii bahut badi taadaad vaaki degree kii dukaane banakar rah gai he jinaki shiksha main koi asal dilchaspee nahin he—unhen to band hi kar dena chahie
 Us old-fashioned little b
 aid
 Programs must necessarily be overcome and move to four-year integrated courses with real imaginative courses
 tamaam collejon ko eemaandaaree or shaikshanik sakhti ke saath acchhee tarah chalaanaa chahie
 To make this possible, considerable government and philanthropic investment will be required
 magar jab tak ham apane shikshakon ko taiyaar karne main nivesh nahin karenge, tab tak yah ummid kaise kar sakate hai ki ve apni bhoomikaayen bakhubi nibhaane kii kshamta se las honge?skool shiksha kii maujuuda pareshaaniyaan kaaphi had tak shikshakon ko shikshit karne kii hamaari pranali kii dayaneey haalat kii vajah se hai
 It is a matter of great pleasure and praise that the Union Government has taken concrete steps in the direction of these reforms, but it will have to work continuously for at least a decade, and then there will be a difference
 duusare, maujuuda nabbe lakh shikshakon ko sahaara dena or taqatvar bananaa hi hoga
 For this, effective ground methods and tools needed for professional development of teachers will need to be developed
 betaratib or asangat shikshak prashikshan ko har haal main band karnaa hoga
 For this, schools will have to provide more and better resources and resources
 karnataka sareekhe kuch rajyon ne shikshakon ke peshewar vikaas ke maamle main acchhee shuruyaat kii he
 Third, we should stop blaming all the evils of our education on the heads of teachers
 isaki bajaae hamen samaaj main—achche samaaj ke vaastushilpi or sarjak ke taur par—unhen unki vaazib jagah deni chahie
 They have to give strength, trust them and support them
 iske liye hamaari shiksha pranali main or zyada bade paimaane par samooche samaaj main saanskrithik kranti kii jarurat he
 India's growth will be determined by the ability and motivation of the front line in all areas of human development
 is agali qatari ko hamen ahmiyat deni chahie or isamen nivesh karnaa hi chahie
 So far we have not done this, so it needs immediate and dramatic changes
 hamaare desh ko zyada nyaaysangat, samtapurna, maanviya or chirsthayee banane ke liye taqatvar banane kii samskruti se badhaava hasil karti agali qatari kii inasaani kaabiliyat or kshamta kii ahm or buniyadi jarurat he
 We should throw our entire national strength behind this

 donon ke saamne hai 34 saal baad bhi vaise hi khadey bhopal gas traasadee ke peedit, jinke jakhmon par itane saal ke baad bhi koi sarkaar maraham nahin laga pai he
 Yet these victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, who have sustained heartburn, write their pain in lakhs of such postcard petitions
 bhopal kii rahane vaali hasina putali ke parivaar ke 3 logon ko gas traasadee ne leel liya tha inako sarkaar kii ore se mili muaavje kaa raashi majna 25 hajaar rupaya he
 Hasina's expectations are completely broken now
 hasina kahati hai, ' bhaiyya ham intazaar karte rahe ye party aegi to sahaayta degi, hamen intazaar main kitne saal ho gayi
 If you tell me, no party has supported us
 hasina system par sawaal uthaate hue kahati hai, 'kyon uthaaenge hamaari awaz, garibon kii awaz koun uthaata he
 Two sons were 10–12 years old
 koi ummid nahin thi
 If you are, Jabbar bhai is working hard to recover his hard work, 'parvar Digar', while 62-year-old Hamida, who lives in Ibrahimpura, still agrees today
 gas traasadee ke baad unke parivaar ke ek-ek kar 41 log jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 She herself is struggling with many diseases
 wo yaad karte hue kahati hai, '2 disambar 1984 kii aadhi raat ko jaan bachaane ke har taraf sirf maut kaa hi manjar dekha
 
 sasuraal
 
 
 My heart was all empty
 
 Vote for no one pays attention
 iske baad hamida ne jo baat kahi sabhi partiyon ke liye kisi bhi tamaache se kam nahin tha, unhone kaha, '34 saal ho gayi
 Till date, no government has written a line inside any manifesto so that the victims are comforted

 It is to be asked where Union Carbide is from Pragya Thakur, she will not be able to tell the direction, we have given 26000 memorandum to Shivraj Chauhan, we do not know where he went
 ' vahiin bhopal gas traasadee par bijepi-congress donon kaa daawa he ki peediton ko bhuule nahi hai
 They hold others responsible not for the condition of the victims
 bijepi pravaktaa rahul kothaari kehete hai, 'lagaataar unase hamaara sampark rahata he, unke bich main kaam karte rahe hai, congress kii sarkaar jab se ai he sirf kaagajon par kaam ho rahaa he jo aspataal banaaya gaya tha bhopal memorial wo band hone kii kagaar par aa gaya isse kharaab kuch nahin ho saktaa'
 At the same time, Congress spokesperson Manak Agarwal says that the BJP government has not paid any attention in 15 years, so it has to go through this situation
 unka kahana he ki digvijay singh to un ilaakon main jate hai pragna ko to pataa hi nahin kisi gali main kya hua tha
 Let me tell you that a recent United Nations report has said that the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984 is one of the biggest industrial accidents in the world
 lekin 34 saal baad bhi agar peedit dar-dar kii thokaren kha rahe hai to uski vajah bhi siyaasi he
 After all, those who had escaped the culprit of this accident were sitting on the chair at that time, so those who save them in the court are sitting on the chair today

 Mrityunjaya says that Harshit always used to sit on his toy bicycle and used to put helmets

 sab ghar lautne ke liye auto main baithe the or auto khud sumit chalaane vaala tha ki achaanak saamne se tej raftaar car ne aisi takkar maari ki sab kuch jaise ek jatke main bikhar gaya
 Looking at the photo of the auto, you can guess how dangerous the collision was
 auto ke parakhche ud gaye
 Harshit's mother Shikha, who is injured in Kasturba Nagar, Shahdara, about 20 km from the hospital, has been discharged from the hospital, but has a fracture in her leg and has also broken her arm, which has been inserted
 pyaar se bete ko hani bulaane vaali shikha uski haalat se bekabar he
 The bus keeps praying to get well soon and return home

 But this legal dispute can take a long time and Mrityunjaya has a shortage of time

 In the last three weeks, Harshit's foot operation, ventilator and ICU expenses have all the capital of Mrityunjay

 But if we consider a recent report, then this pair of Varun Alia i

 It has been heard that both of them have taken this decision very strictly, now both will not work together
 kariyar kii shuruyaat se lekar ab tak varun or aalia lagbhag aath filmein kar chuke hai
 Three of these films were done simultaneously
 ho saktaa he ki isi vajah se ab donon ek duusare se duuri banaakar kuch naye ko stars ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hon

 But after this decision, it seems that not only the fans of Varun and Alia, but also the producers and directors, who were dreaming of making a film with them, will get a big shock
 haalanki iske peeche kuch log ek vajahasiddharth malhotra or aalia bhattaki relationships ko bhi maan rahe hai
 Both of them also started their careers with the same film

 When the party promoted Congress President Rahul Gandhi as the face of the post of PM in 2019, only the allies began to disavow
 itnaa hi nahin argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ke bhi sur badal gaye
 Before the opposition's clan was formed against PM Modi, it started to shatter
 aise main congress ne apane kadam peeche khinchne main der nahin kii or mayawati yaa phir mamata banerjee ko piem banane ke sanket de die
 The party's considered strategy behind this move is being considered
 agle saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main modi ko maat dene ke liye vipakshi dal ekajute hokar muqabla karnaa chaahate hai, lekin netritv ko lekar sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 The opposition's satraps, who are potential allies of the Congress, are not yet ready to accept Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate
 haalanki, congress kaarysmiti (CWC) kii baithak ke baad congress party nerahul gandhi ko 2019 ke liye piem padke chehre ke taur par pesh kiya he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, 'the Congress decision is precise, flat and clear
 rahul gandhi hamaara cheharaa hai
 We will go to the public under his leadership
 jab ham sabase bada dal honge to swaabhaavik rup se vahi cheharaa honge
 There is no scope for doubt in this
 'congress ke rahul ke netritv main chunaav ladane par ab tak sirf jedies hi sahaj dikh rahi he baaki sahyogi dal isse hichak rahe hai
 In a gesture, the RJD raised many more names for the post, questioning Rahul's claim to the post of PM
 tejasvi ke baad mayawati ne bhi congress ko do took sandesh dete hue kaha ki madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main gathbandhan tabhi sambhav he, jab unki party ko sammanjanak siten milengi
 Even if the deal does not get respectable seats, his party is fully prepared to fight alone
 PM pad par rahul kii daavedaari par sahyogi dalon kii naaraazgi ko dekhte congress ne apane kadam peeche khinch liye hai
 In fact, the Congress does not want to be scattered in the Grand Alliance at any cost
 isiilie ranneeti ke tahat congress ne mayawati yaa phir mamata banerjee ke naam ko bhi pesh kar diya
 To stop the BJP, the Congress may support Mayawati or Mamata Banerjee by accepting him as the Prime Minister
 lekin aisi sthiti tab aegi jab congress ko ummid se kam siten milengi
 The Congress has devised a strategy to bring two big leaders through it, because it is these two leaders who cannot accept Rahul's leadership right now
 itnaa hi in donon netaaon ke man main pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab kaaphi dinon se he
 However, the Congress has conveyed the message to the nation by taking forward Rahul's face
 ab iske baad sahyogiyon ko sadhakar rakhane ke liye mayawati or mamata banerjee ke naam ko bhi aage badha diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress wants to enter the 2019 battlefield on the lines of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 congress 2004 kii tarah koshish main he ki party ko kisi bhi tarah se 120 se 150 siten mil jaae
 At the same time, it is difficult for any party from the Congress ally to get more than 40 seats
 aise main aakhirkaar baaji congress ke naam rahegi
 After this, the Congress will forward the name of any of its leaders to the post of Prime Minister, just like Rahul Gandhi or Manmohan Singh
 chunaav nateezon ke baad kshatrapon ke paas koi vikalp bhi nahin bachegaa
 In such a situation, it will be his compulsion to stay with the Congress
 salaami ballebaaj tameem ikbaal ke lagaataar duusare match main lagaaye gayi shatak or wicketiper ballebaaj mushafikar rahim ke saath unki shatkeey saajhedaari se bangladesh ne duusare vanade match main pakistan ko saat wicket se haraa diya
 With this, Bangladesh have taken an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-match series

 input language kisi hollywood actress kaa ekadam se beparda ho janaa koi nai baat nahin he
 This happens every day
 par is baar maamla kuch alag tarah kaa he
 New photos of several Hollywood actresses have been leaked on social media
 jenifer laurence, ket aptan jaisi nami-giraami celebrities ne apni ye tasviren to khud hi khinchi thim, par inaki manshaa use apane phone main hi ‘store’ karne kii rahi hogi
 He would not have thought that the hackers would break into his iphone and expose his personal photos to the world
 yah cese ‘jaraa hatke’ he, isliye isaki cheer-faad jaruri he
 Here an attempt has been made to look into the matter in some psychological and some practical ways
 apni neude photo khinchne kii jarurat kya he?insaan apane jivan main kuch romaanch chahta he
 These adventures can be mountaineering, swimming, car races, horse riding
 lekin sabase kam risk liye bina or pehle ginaae gaye kuch kaamon kii tulana main zyada romaanchak ho saktaa he ekant main khud ko neude kar lenaa or apni photo khinch lenaa
 Some similar adventures are hidden in the wardrobe malfunction
 yah bhi iradatan kiya jaataa he
 It is different that there is a desire to get publicity at its core
 kisi celebrity kaa kisi program main bina undergarment ke aa janaa kya he? sharir main teji se daudti vahi sansanaahat mahasoos karne kii chaah, jiskaa rup alag-alag maukon par thodaa alag-alag hota he
 Is this a case of interference in privacy? This question may have different answers
 ‘haa’ or ‘naa’ ke peeche apane-apane tark ho sakate hai
 At first glance, it seems to be a case of interference in privacy
 maan len, kisi actress ne kisi magazine ke cover ke liye apni neude tasviir de di, to kya use is baat ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he ki vah paanch-saat or magazine ke liye waisi hi photo de? is vajah se ki usne ek baar to apni deh dikhaa hi di he
 
 
 Even if there is no porn star, it is ultimately up to him to decide when to show his body, when not
 sab kuch uski ‘udaartaa’ par nirbhar he
 From this perspective, stealing a photo of someone's personal life and bedroom scene and bringing it between unapproved publics is theft, interfering in privacy
 ek natural or sabase ahm sawaal yah he ki aakhir log duusare kii neude photo dekhte kyon hai? iske kuch jawaab ye ho sakate hai:1
 To the extent that things are secretive, the desire to see the hidden within the human is equally intense
 jo chijen hameshaa se najaron ke saamne hoti he, unhen dekhne kii ichha utani gahari nahin hoti
 In the tribal areas of the world where women still keep their upper parts open, the men living with them will hardly stare at their breasts
 vajah yahi he ki jo har roj khulaa miltaa he, use dekhne kii ichha kyon jor maaregi
 2
 ‘real life’ or ‘reel life’ kaa farkajahan tak celebrities ko neude dekhne kii ichha kii baat he, isaki vajah bhi ekadam saaf he
 The suppressed desire can never be fulfilled in real life, people try to compensate through reel life
 internet ne ise ekadam aasaan bana diya he
 Type a name in the search engine and within seconds the desired result is revealed, whether real or extracted from Photoshop
 aise main neude image yaa video dekhnaa bhi sex kii purti kaa ek ‘mod’ ban jaataa he
 3
 har baar kuch nayaa chahiegupta chizon kaa har baar naepan ke saath saamne aana alag tarah kaa aakarshan paidaa karata he
 Every time the same thing produces boredom
 jo log apane mobile yaa laptop main neude image yaa video sahejkar rakhte hai, ve bhi har baar kuch nae kii talash main rahete hai
 This difference between new and old is huge, like a cricket match
 jo match guzar chukaa he, uske hilites ko aakhir koi kab tak or kitni baar dekhnaa chahega? har kisi ko ek nae match kaa intjaar hota he
 The same applies more or less to porn
 4
 It is also a case of addiction
 In most cases, pornography begins with an eagerness to see body parts, but gradually it takes the form of addiction
 yahi lat baar-baar internet or porn tak khinchati he
 5
 striyon kii deh kii banaavataisa nahin he ki porn sirf purush hi dekhte hai
 Women are also interested in it
 darasal, yah har kisi ke personal intrest se judaa maamla he
 Despite this, the shape of the female body is something that attracts the eyes of men
 deh khuli na milane par log idhar-udhar kapadon ke bheetar najaron se hi ‘scan’ tak karne lagate hai
 Psychology of taking your nude photographs and then avoiding slander is also different
 khushvanth singh or ‘nagn chitra’divangat ho chuke patrkaar khushvanth singh ne apane kollam main ‘nagn chitra’ heading ke saath kuch jaankariyaan pathakon se saajha kii thim
 He had revealed that one of his friends has a large collection of nude photos, which he himself has seen
 unhone apane us mitra ke anubhav ke aadhaar par bataaya ki apane desh ke mahanagaron main jo yuvatiyaan apni neude photo dene ke liye badi aasaani se taiyaar ho gayi, unamem se zyaadaatar kii chahat yah thi ki bhale hi unke angon kii photo saarvajanik ho jaae, par unki pahchaan jaahir nahin honi chahie
 This psychology of taking a new photograph can be easily understood by this one example
 naitikta or aniatikta kii bahesadrasal, alag-alag daur main ek hi kaam ko ekadam ulat tareeke se diphine kiya jaataa rahaa he
 This is the reason why it is not easy to take or view a nude photo, to tie it in one circle of morality and immorality
 yah bahut-kuch use chashme par nirbhar he, jiske jariye use dekhne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Is the whole fault of the new technology? Probably not, because the option of choosing or not to choose technology is open to everyone
 koi bhi phone selfi khinchne ko majaboor nahin karata
 In fact, it is not possible to use the benefits of technology very much and to remain untouched by its losses
 ab aage kya
 
 
 There are hardly any serious lessons to be drawn from the nude photos of actresses like Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Mary A
 Winstead, Ariana Grande
 epabiai hekking ke maamle ko sulajhaati rahegi or duniya apni raah par apni raftaar se chalati rahegi

 US President Barack Obama has defended his decision of limited military action against the Assad regime in Syria, saying the matter has become a question of credibility of the international community and cannot remain silent about 'vandalism'
 duusari ore, roosi raashtrapati bladimir putin ne syria par hamale ko lekar america or uske sahyogi deshon ko aagaah kiya he obama ne stoffhome main swedish pradhanmantri fredrik refilt ke saath sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan main aaj kaha, ‘‘main or pradhanmantri refilt isse sahamat hai ki is tarah kii barbarta ko dekhte hue antarrashtriya samudaay khamosh nahin rah saktaa he
 If action is not taken, the risk of more chemical attacks will increase and it is feared that other countries will also start using chemical weapons
 ’’ He said, "my credibility is not at stake
 antarrashtriya samudaay kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par lagi he or america tathaa congress kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par he kyonki ham sirf baaten karte hai ki antarrashtriya niyam mahatvapurn hai
 '' ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal ke khilaaf lakshmana rekha unki ore se nahin khinchi gai he, balki yah khud antarrashtriya samudaay kii ore se khinchi gai he
 The US alleges that at least 1,429 people, including 400 children, were killed in a chemical attack carried out on August 21 by the Assad regime in Syria
 syrian sarkaar ne rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal se inkaar kiya he
 Russian President Putin said that any military action would be an 'invasion' without the permission of the United Nations
 unhone asad shashan dwaara rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal ke bare main saboot pesh karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 At the same time, he also said that if it is proved without any doubt that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons, then he will not shy away from supporting the UN Security Council resolution related to military action
 saint petersburg main ji-20 deshon kii kal shuru ho rahi shikhar baithak ke pehle putin kaa yah bayaan saamne aayaa he

 america congress ke sadasyon ne kaha he ki seenet kii videsh maamalon kii samiti kii ore se syria ke bare main taiyaar kiye gaye prastaav main 60 din kii sainya karrwai kii ijaajat di gai he

 tippaniyan The Obama administration told US lawmakers that the US is not only at risk of losing its international allies and allies if it does not take military action against the Syrian Bashar al-assad regime over alleged chemical weapons use
 His credibility may also be discounted
 america ke videsh mantri jon kerri ne america seenet se kaha, ‘yadi ham karrwai karne main naakaam rahete hai to hamaare sahyogi desh ghat jaaenge
 We will have less people with whom we trust, especially in the region
 ’ On the other hand, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the US and its allies about the attack on Syria
 Obama said today at a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Refielt in Stockholm, "I and Prime Minister Refilte agree that this The international community cannot remain silent in view of the kind of vandalism
 agar karrwai nahin kii gai to or adhik rasinic hamalon kaa khatra bad jayega tathaa ashanka he ki duusare desh bhi rasinic hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne lagenge
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘meri vishwasaneeyata daanv par nahin he
 The credibility of the international community is at stake and the credibility of the US and the Congress is at stake because we just talk that international rules are important
 ’’ In response to a question, he said that the Laxman Rekha has not been drawn by him against the use of chemical weapons, but it has been drawn by the international community itself
 america kaa aarope he ki syria ke asad shashan kii ore se beete 21 agast ko kiye gaye rasinic hamale main 400 bacchon sahit kam se kam 1,429 logon kii maut ho gai

 reverse swing bowling khelnaa kisi bhi ballebaaj ke liye sabase mushkil kaam he
 In such a situation, even the legendary batsmen like Toschin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid lose their sweat
 haalanki, mahaan ballebaaj koi na koi rasta nikaal hi lete hai
 At a BMW event in Melbourne recently, Sachin shared a funny anecdote about how he devised a unique recipe to counter New Zealand bowler Chris Cairns' dangerous reverse swing bowling
 jab ganguli ne shart utaarne ko kaha
 
 sachin ne bataaya, 'ham mohali main newjiland ke khilaaf khel rahe the
 Chris Cairns was bowling
 rahul dravid bhi mere saath batting kar rahe the
 The ball was swinging reverse
 kerns hamen do-teen baar beet kar chuke the
 We could not understand how to counter them
 hamen ball kii shining said najar nahin aa rahi thi
 Sometimes the pitch is such that it becomes difficult to see the bright side of the ball
 reverse swing kaa pataa lagane ke liye ball kii shining or raf said dekhnaa jaruri hota he
 When Sachin could not see the bright side of the ball even after repeated attempts, he came up with a funny idea and told it to Rahul Dravid
 bataur sachin, 'maine rahul ko kaha ki jab main non-striker chor par rahoonga to kerns kii taraf dekhuunga ki ball kii chamakdaar said koun si he
 i will hold the bat in the same hand the way the ball glows
 agar wo out swing karegaa to main baayen haath main bat pakaduunga or agar in swing karegaa to main daaen haath se bat pakaduunga
 This recipe of Sachin worked and was followed by many great shots
 sab fielder yah dekhakar hairaan the
 Chris Cairns himself could not understand how the batsmen who were unable to read his ball some time back, suddenly started scoring runs easily
 kuch der ke baad newjiland ke filderon ko ehsaas hua ki sachin non striker chor par khadey hokar rahul ko nahin, balki bowler ko dekh rahe hai
 That is, in some way Sachin is sending a message to his fellow batsman about the shining side of the ball
 sachin ne bataaya, 'iske baad kris kerns ne apni lay khod di
 He caught the ball from the cross sim and ran to bowl
 vah bowling krij ke paas aakar ruk gaya or mujhase kaha ki ab kya karoge
 Cairns did not know that i had already told Rahul that if i did not know where the bright side of the ball was, i would hold the bat with both hands and put it between the two legs
 ' sachin ke kariyar kaa yah mjedaar kissa sunakar vahaan maujuud log jamkar hanse

 After the sixth accused in the Delhi gang rape case proved to be a minor, the debate has now started that according to the current Juvenile Act, he will be released in the next few months
 bahes kaa mudda yah bhi he ki kya balig hone kii umr 18 se ghataakar 16 kar deni chahie
 According to the current Child Reform Act (juvenile Law), any minor can be sentenced to a maximum of 3 years for his crime under which he is sent to a child improvement home and cannot be placed here after he is 18 years of age
 yahi nahin agar kisi vyakti ne 18 saal se pehle koi aparaadh kiya he or uske balig hone par use doshi tehraaya jaataa he tab bhi use sudhaar grih main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Because he was a minor at the time of the crime, he does not even have a jail sentence
 aise main apradhi ko chhodane ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachataa
 According to the current law, a person serving a sentence in a juvenile home can not be sent to jail if he or she becomes a child
 dilli gangrape maamle main naaballig aaropee kaa peedit ladki ke saath sabase zyada krur vyavhaar or uske saath do baar rape (ek baar uske behosh ho jane ke baad) karne kii baaten saamne aane ke baad balig hone kii umr ghataakar 16 saal karne kii jabardast maang uth rahi he
 On the other hand, some experts say that such a change in the law would be unfair to other child criminals and it would be like taking away their child rights, considering only one case
 gauratlab he ki criminal justise lau 2012 sansad main paas hone ke liye lambit he or visheshgyon kii maang he ki isi sanshodhan vidheyak main juvenil kii umr 18 se ghataakar 16 kar di jaani chahie
 In the Delhi gang rape case, the police has not given the name of the sixth accused in the charge sheet, because according to his school certificates he is a minor

 iphone 11 Pro main lokation acces ko lekar research ne dhyaan dilaayaa
 To access the location, all apps have to access the location block
 aam taur par Apple ko privesi pasand company mana jaataa he
 The iphone is also considered to be safer than Android smartphones and so is it
 aipal ke siio tim cook bhi samay samay par fasebuk kii aalochana karte rahe hai or isaki vajah yugers kii privesi
 The iphone 11 Pro tracks users' locations even when they should not
 is tarah kii khabar aa rahi he
 That is to say, security researcher Brian Kreb
 haal hi main inhone paaya he ki iphone 11 Pro tab bhi lokation trek karata he jab aapane lokation of karke rakhaa he
 This matter seems serious
 agar aap yphone yujar hai yaa kabhi bhi yphone yuj kiya he to pataa hoga ki lokation on hone par screen ke sabase upar ek chota ero kaa ikon dikhataa he
 It means location on
 isi tarah lokation of hone kii sthiti main ye ero ikon nahin dikhataa he
 Although in the settings you also get an option to hide the arrow icon Brian Krebs, researcher at krebsonsecurity, has said that he had turned off the location of iphone 11 Pro, yet other apps of iphone were accessing their location
 haalanki ye samasya is model ke alaava duusare yphone main nahin mili he
 Despite location being off, Brian Krebs reached out to Apple Support regarding the location access issue by the apps
 aipal saport forum main unhone isaki jaankaree di, lekin aipal kaa respons aisa rahaa, jaise ye koi mistek nahin he
 Not only this, Apple has also said that the company does not feel that it can cause any problems with users about security
 aipal ke ek ejeeniyar ne statement main kaha he, 'ye apekshit he ki lokation sarvice ikon states baar main tab dikhataa he jab lokation on hota he
 These icons appear for system services that do not have settings switched on, 'krebs wrote in his blogpost,' Apple's new iphone 11 still asks for users' location when you have never requested data for all applications and system services
 By setting it to 'there is an easy way to turn off location in iphone, you can turn it off by going to Settings with the Privacy option, but this does not ensure that
 Now that no app is accessing your location
 kisi ap dwaara lokation acces ko block karne ke liye alag alag ap main ja kar vahaan lokation acces block karne kaa opshan miltaa he
 But this security researcher has found that the location is being collected despite turning off the location in different apps in the iphone 11 Pro
 isse pehle ios 13 ke saath logon ne is tarah kii samasya ke bare main bataaya tha
 At present, it has not been clear from the statement of Apple's engineers why this is happening
 bhale hi aipal ko ye galati na lage, lekin ek yujar ke liye ye dikkat vaali baat to he hi

 To give reservation to Gurjars in Rajasthan, the Gehlot government has taken a big decision
 khel mantri ashok chandana ne cabinet kii meeting ke baad elaan kiya ki gurjaron ke aarakshan ke liye rajasthan vidhansabha main prastaav aayega
 According to the government, after the resolution is passed, the demand for Gurjars will be fulfilled and with this their movement will end
 buudhvaar ko vidhansabha main gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye ek baar phir se prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 This will be the third time when a proposal to give 5 percent reservation to Gurjars will be introduced in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly
 vidhansabha kii ore se aarakshan ke prastaav ko paarit karke centre sarkaar ke paas bheja jayega ki jis tarj par garib agadon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan centre sarkaar ne diya he usee tarj par gurjaron ke paanch fisadi aarakshan ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan kiya jaae
 By doing this, the Congress government wants to put the ball of Gujjar reservation in the court of the BJP government at the center
 mana ja rahaa he ki is bill ke paarit hone ke baad rajasthan main gurjar aarakshan kaa andolan khatm ho saktaa he or lakho logon ko raahat mil sakati he
 Thousands of people are stranded due to Gujjar reservation
 pichley 5 dinon main 45 trainen prabhavit huin jisamen 14 trainen radd kii gayi, jabaki lakhon log isse prabhavit hue hai
 After the cabinet meeting, Minister of State for Sports Ashok Chandna said that the demand of Gurjar will be passed in the assembly and after that the Gurjar agitation will end
 congress ke liye majaburi bhi he ki jald se jald vah gurjar aarakshan ke andolan ko khatm kare kyonki jagah-jagah hinsa kii ghatnaayen badhati ja rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Congress National President Rahul Gandhi is coming to the Seva Dal program in Ajmer on 14 February and Gurjars are agitating for reservation in that area too
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki gurjar aarakshan kaa bill laane se sachin payalat ko mukhyamantri nahin banane se naaraaz gurjar ek baar phir congress kii taraf laut sakate hai
 Last week, the Gurjar community has started its agitation once demanding the reservation and has blocked rail tracks at many places
 andolankariyon ne dilli-mumbai railmarg par railgadiyon kii awajahi roak di he
 People of Gurjar community are demanding 5% reservation in jobs and colleges in Rajasthan
 andolankariyon ke netaa karnal kirodi singh bansla ne kaha, "ham apane samudaay ke liye usee tarah paanch fisadi aarakshan chaahate hai, jis tarah centre sarkaar ne aarthik rup se pichde logon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 There is no response to our demand from the government
 koi hamase baatcheet karne bhi nahin aayaa, isliye hamen majabuuran yah kadam uthaanaa padaa he
 "on the other hand, the Rajasthan government says that the Gurjar agitation should end and its representatives should talk to the government but nothing like this happens

 Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Bhimrao Ambedkar and head of the deprived Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) party, announced 6 months ago that he would form an alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi's party and contest all 48 seats in Maharashtra

 lekin may ke maheene main agar yah centre main gaiyr bijepi or gaiyr congressi sarkaar banane main yogadan de pai to phir hamen koi nahin roak paaegaa
 Prakash Ambedkar is contesting from here
 64 varshiya ambedkar sholapur ke alaava vidarbha kshetra kii akola seat se bhi chunaav lard rahe hai
 The VBA considers itself a representative of the castes of Maharashtra who are oppressed and marginalized

 Maharashtra has so far been inclined towards two traditional fronts - Sharad pawar-congress and bjp-shiv Sena

 singapore ke shiksha mantri en i hen ne kaha he ki desh main bhashaa ke rup me hindi seekhney kii lalak teji se bad rahi he
 Some of the Hindi learners believe that by understanding this language they will be able to enjoy Bollywood music more, while some consider it important due to India's rise as an economic power
 hen ne hindi kendra diwas ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘‘yah nihsandeh bollywood kii badhati lokapriyata kaa ek pramaan he
 For some, it is a means of understanding popular songs (of Bollywood films)
 iske alaava isaki saanskrithik bhoomika he
 However, many believe that Hindi is an economic asset
 khaskar bharat ke udai ke kaaran
 Hein appreciated the increasing interest in Hindi courses and language being run by non-hindi speaking people for the society
 hen ne aashwaasan diya ki hindi ke saath saath bengali, gujarati, punjabi or urdu ko bhi tamil kii tarah maatrubhaasha kii shrenee main rakhte hue unhen seekhney ke liye prerit kiya jaayegaa
 The Singapore government recognizes four languages - English, Malay, Chinese (mendarin) and Tamil as official languages
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main is baat kii ore prasannataa se dhyaan dilaanaa chahta hum ki hindi samaaj apane samanaantar hindi kaarykram ke jariye hamaare praathmik evam madhyamik skulon main hamaare chaatro ko hindi padhane ke liye paryaapt avasar dene ke apane prayaason main dinondin majboot ho rahaa he
 He said that four more schools joined the Hindi teaching program this year, which has increased the number of schools with Hindi classes to 53
 mantri ne kaha ki singapore main saat hindi kendra chalaaye ja rahe hai
 Children living close to these centers learn Hindi
 hen ne kaha, ‘‘singapore main rahane ke kaaran ham bhaagyashaalee hai ki hamaara samaaj bahu nasli evam bahusaanskrithik he
 Due to this we have got the unique advantage of such communities whose languages and culture are connected to the major development centers of the world
 ’’singapore sarkaar bengali, gujarati, hindi, punjabi kii shiksha ko sahyog detii he jiske liye dedh lakh singapore dollar kii madad di jaati he

 sonia gandhi bhale hi congress kii kaaryakari adhyaksh bani hon lekin vaapasi hote hi digvijay singh puri tarah se form main aa gaye hai
 Digvijay Singh, who made an open statement from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi during the UPA regime, was not getting much attention during the tenure of former party president Rahul Gandhi
 haal yah tha ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi unhone saarvajanik rup se dard bayaan karte hue tha, 'mere bhaashan se congress ke vot katate hai, isliye main reliyon main nahin jaataa
 'digvijay Singh was absent in election rallies at that time
 madhya pradesh kii reliyon main digvijay singh kaa na hona kaaryakarta or media ke bich charchaa kaa vishay tha
 One reason for this was that the party strategists felt that Digvijay Singh's statements had caused considerable damage earlier also, so it was okay to keep a proper distance from them
 yahaan tak ki postaron main bhi digvijay singh nahin dikhaae de rahe the
 Once called the political 'guru' of Rahul Gandhi, Digvijay Singh went completely isolated in the party
 isi bich vah pragna singh thakur ke haathon loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi haar gaye
 But during Sonia Gandhi's tenure, Digvijay Singh was one of the party's policymakers and was a leader in political battles and rhetoric
 unke upar sonia gandhi kaa vishwaas puri tarah se tha
 Then it seems that Digvijay Singh has come into form as soon as Sonia Gandhi comes into command
 1 sitambar ko ek baar phir unhone chirparichit andaaj main bayaan diya ki 'bajrang or bhaajapa vaale iesai se paisa le rahe hai
 Pay attention to this
 ek baat or ki pakistan ke iesai kii jasusi muslim se zyada gaiyr muslim kar rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh also gave a clarification on Twitter, seeing that the matter caught fire, 'some channels are running that i have accused BJP of spying for Pakistan by taking money from ISI
 yah puri tarah se galat he
 The mps of the Bajrang Dal and the bjp's IT cell took the money from the ISI to spy on Pakistan while spying for Pakistan
 maine yah aarope lagaaya he jis par main aaj bhi qaayam hum channel vaale ye sawaal bhaajapa se kyon nahin poochhate'
 But the biggest story of Digvijay Singh coming into form came when Umang Singhar, one of the 28 cabinet ministers of the Kamal Nath-led government, shocked everyone by saying that Digvijay Singh was running the government from the curtain
 darasal kuch din pehle digvijay singh ne madhya pradesh ke mantriyon ko patr likhaa tha jisamen poocha tha, ' maine janvari se 15 agast 2019 tak sthanantaran sahit anya vishyon se sambandhit patr aavashyak karrwai ke liye bheje the
 In that i requested to give information in case of action taken or not taken on my letters
 mere dwaara preshit patron par kii gai karrwai ke bare main jaanane ke liye main aapse milanaa chahta hum, iske liye samay pradaan karne kaa ksht karen
 When reporters were asked questions by the state forest minister Umang Singhar on his letter, he said that it is former CM Digvijay Singh who is actually running the state government from behind the scenes, 'the government will say about the honorable Digvijay Singh
 Driving from behind
 ye sabko pataa he jagazahir he, pradesh kii janata jaanati he congress kaa kaaryakarta jaanata he unhen chitthee likhni kii aavashyaktaa nahin he jab sarkaar hi chalaa rahe hai to chitthee likhni kii aavashyaktaa kyon'
 The thing to be seen at the moment is how much benefit or loss does Digvijay Singh give to the Congress once again

 ) The stance of the main opposition party Congress on the GST bill appears to be soft in the monsoon session
 congress apni mukhya maang 18 fisadi tex rate par cap ko sanvaidhanik sanshodhan main rakhane par naram pad gai he
 However, the Congress is seeking assurances from the government of guaranteeing tax rate on its demand
 sutron ke mutabik, sarkaar kii taraf se vitt mantri arun jetali or sansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar ke saath gulam nabi aaazaad ke bich sakaaratmak baatcheet hui, jisamen congress main apana nayaa rukh sarkaar ko bataa diya, ab party ko sarkaar ke jawaab kaa intjaar he
 The PM gave the signal to meet the opponents, just before the commencement of the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister himself went to meet Sonia Gandhi in front, then met all the leaders including Mulayam Singh sitting in the front line
 vaise to ye piem kaa shishtachar tha, lekin iske siyaasi myne maane ja rahe hai
 It is believed that the PM has indicated that the opposition will take along
 congress kii maangon par ek najarcongress ne bill par apni mukhya maang mennarmi ke sanketadie hai
 Till now the Congress had stuck to its three demands on the GST bill
 pehla- jiesti par sanvaidhanik sanshodhan bill main hi tex rate kaa cap 18 pratishat nirdhaarit kiya jaae
 Secondly, the constitution of authority for settlement of GST disputes
 teesraa-utpaadak rajyon par atirikt ek fisadi tex ko waapas liya jaae
 Due to these three demands of the Congress, the GST bill could not be passed in many Parliament sessions
 congress ke rukh main badlaav kii vajah haal ke chunaavon main congress kii haar or raajnneetik rup se rajyasabha main party kaa kamjor hona mana ja rahaa he
 After the new stand of the Congress on the way to find a middle way, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar are expected to negotiate with Congress leaders in the next one or two days
 congress kii pehali or mukhya maang par sarkaar kii taraf se teen vikalp rakhe hai, yaa to jiesti rate ko bill ke sahaayak niyamon main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he yaa phirgsti ratki seemaa ko jiesti bill main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If not, the government should bring a draft in which legal protection can be given to the GST rate
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki sansad ke monsoon satr main sabakaa sahyog lekar bahupratikshit jiesti bill ko paarit kara liya jayega
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge in the Lok Sabha has to say on this matter that there is a close agreement between us and the government on the two demands
 sonia gandhi lengin aakhri faislavahin mana ja rahaa he ki buudhvaar ko sonia jab congress sansadeey dal main apane saansadon se mukhaatib hongi, tab jiesti par unka rukh kaaphi kuch tay kar saktaa he
 GST is a constitutional amendment bill
 aise main rajyasabha order main rahe or zyaadaatar logon kaa samarthan hasil ho isliye sarkaar ke liye bhi jaruri he ki usko congress kaa samarthan jiesti par hasil ho
 However, given the recent trend of both sides, there are still positive signs of passing this bill in this session

 march kii 7 taarikh ko telugudesham party (tidipi) ne endie se alag raah par chalane kaa faisla le liya or tay ho gaya ki agle din tidipi cote ke donon mantri centre sarkaar se istipha denge
 Shortly thereafter, BJP President Amit Shah assured the senior leaders of the party that BJP 2019 is capable of winning on its own
 uske baad bhaajapa kii taraf se na to naidu ko manaane kii koshish hui, na hi unase koi sampark saadhaa gaya
 The pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have indicated to the allies that the BJP will not take any initiative to seek and sustain cooperation and support
 is pahal ke liye sahyogi dalon ko khud faisla lenaa hoga
 BJP general secretary Arun Singh told India Today, "BJP under Modi ji had won an absolute majority in the last Lok Sabha election yet we gave our allies a berth in the cabinet
 2019main bhaajapa ko pichley chunaav se bhi badi safalataa milegi
 In such a situation, it will be a success for the associates who are with us
 lene or dene ke formule par congress apana gathbandhan banaati he, bhaajapa nahin
 "so BJP 2019 will fight without allies? Answering this, BJP General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya says," JD (U) left us in the last election
 hamane jad (you) ke bina ladane kaa faisla liya
 We fought and won
 baad main jad (you) ke rup main hamaara purana sahyogi waapas hamaare saath aayaa
 In the circumstances created by the TDP quitting the NDA and the change in the stance of other allies, the BJP is more or less churning out the same strategy under which the BJP left after Nitish split
 isi ranneeti ko apanaate hue party maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena kii parvaah kiye bina chunaav main utari or jeet hasil kii
 a BJP leader says that leaving with allies is not going to make any big difference
 aise main sahyogiyon kaa saath chhodie ko lekar bhaajapa khud ko beparwaah dikhaae, yah ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti he
 Therefore, BJP, LJP, Shiv Sena, Suheldev is not bothered about the threat directly and indirectly received by the Bharatiya Samaj Party
 sutron kaa kahana he ki party yah faisla kar chuki he ki gathbandhan badhaane yaa banaae rakhane ke liye jhukne se behatar vikalp he, apane dam par ladaa jaae
 If by 2019, the situation of BJP vs others becomes, then BJP considers it to be favorable for itself
 haalanki bhaajapa ke is rukh ko sahyogi dal ghaatak bataa rahe hai
 TDP leader Thota Narasimhan says that constituents are important for any alliance
 jin ilaakon main bhaajapa kii maujuudagi naam maatr kii he, vahaan sahyogiyon ke vot party ko milte hai
 Such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar or Tamil Nadu
 pichley chunaav main bhaajapa ne isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue un dalon se bhi gathjod kiya jo koi bhi seat jeetne kii sthiti main nahin the
 There are still two dozen such parties in the NDA which do not have any seats of their own
 algepi ke ek netaa kaa maananaa he ki bihar main jad (you) or bhaajapa majboot hai
 But they also say that if the other parties become one in front of these two, then it will be difficult for the BJP
 philhal badale siyaasi sameekaran ke bich bhaajapa pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chhavi ke sahare hi aage chal padi, he
 Even if an alliance leaves
 sahyogiyon ko hi aakraamak rukh dikhaane ke liye bhaajapa ne tidipi kii taraf se aae avishvaas prastaav ke baad loksabhaa main grih mantri rajnath singh kii taraf se bayaan dilvaaya ki sarkaar avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 Prior to TDP, the YSR Congress had also given notice of the no-confidence motion but the government made its stand when TDP also gave notice of the no-confidence motion to the Lok Sabha Secretariat
 bhaajapa philhal apni puri takat is baat par laga rahi he ki jin rajyon main sahyogi saath hai, vahaan bhi party ko majboot kiya jaae
 The BJP has activated its strong general secretary Ram Madhav in Andhra Pradesh as soon as the TDP has disbanded
 unhen us blue print par kaam karne ko kaha gaya he jiske jariye pichde varg main bhaajapa kii paith ko badhaayaa gaya
 Sources say that under this formula, BJP President Amit Shah made bjp's entry into backward and non-jatav Dalits while in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 bihar se bhaajapa ke donon puraane sahyogi ram vilaas paswan or upendra kushvaha to tab se asahaj hai jab se nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke paale main aa gaye hai
 Sources say that a message has been given to these two leaders that the BJP is not ready to take any pressure on the seat sharing
 yah jaruri nahin he ki pichley chunaav main in dalon ko jitani siten di gayi utani hi is baar bhi milen
 Since the Shiv Sena has already passed a resolution in Maharashtra that the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections will be contested alone, seat-sharing is not a matter of discussion there
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki agar shivasena saath laduya chaahegi to swaagat he lekin siton ko lekar bhaajapa kisi tarah kii maang nahin maanegi
 The important thing is that irrespective of the allies, the BJP is not ready to pay attention to its old allies
 punjab main akali dal par bhaajapa kii taraf se lagaataar yah dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he ki 2019 main bhaajapa ko saat seat di jaaen
 Till now BJP has been contesting 3 and Akali 10 seats
 isi dabaav ko badhaane ke liye bhaajapa punjab main akele congress sarkaar ke khilaaf pole-khol abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 The Akali Dal is running a similar program
 endie kaa hissaa hote hue bhi donon ek saath nahin hai
 BJP General Secretary Vijayvargiya says, "the bjp's influence is across the country
 jahaan hamaara prabhaav kam he, vahaan ham khud ko majboot kar rahe hai
 Till a few years ago we used to be junior partners in Bihar or Maharashtra but under Modiji's leadership, BJP is the largest party in these states
 is vyaavhaarik ganit ko samajhnaa kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke liye jaruri he
 Despite being the largest party, BJP understands this math

 The red flag of the Jalpaiguri parliamentary seat came into existence at the time of the election for the third Lok Sabha
 us dauraan desh ke janamanas or raajnneeti main congress ke saath hi jawaharlal nehru kii abha chai hui thi
 Its impact has been visible in the left-wing West Bengal, and the Congress continued to hoist its flag in the general elections held in 1992, 1967 and 1971 on the Jalpaiguri parliamentary seat
 lekin apatkaal ke baad desh ke saath hi jalpaigudi seat kii bhi tasviir badali or 1977 ke chunaavon main swatantra ummidavaar khagendra nath dasgupta ne yahaan se jeet hasil kii

 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main trinmul congress ke vijay chandra burman yahaan se chunakar sansad pahunche
 Social background Dalits and tribals account for about 80 percent of the population of Jalpaiguri district
 yah vajah he ki jalpaigudi kii saat vidhansabha siton main se chah anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye surakshit hai
 In the Delimitation Commission's 2009 Delimitation Report, Jalpaiguri Lok Sabha seat was divided into seven constituencies
