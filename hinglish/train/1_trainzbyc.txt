ratorat karodpati banane kii khwaish ne desh main hazaron logon kaa paisa sapanom ke is saudagar ke jaal main funskar gavaan diya
 By demolishing every market rule and every formula of profit, this company came up with such a magical offer to double and triple the amount that the investors were dazzled by greed
 
 
 90 din main 9000 rupee 15000 kiijie150 din main 9000 rupee 27000 kiijie300 din main 50,000 ke 1,5 xxrep 4 0 or company kaa jet super plan: 150 din main 5 lakh 15 lakh keejiejitne bade sapane, utani badi chamak or jitani badi chamak utana hi bada dhokhaa
 This game of greed, lies and deceit was played by Ravindra Deshmukh, a man from Satara region of Maharashtra, who had deceit in everything and in every style there was only deception
 hindustan ke lakhon-lakh logon kaa mustakabil badalane ja rahe deshmukh ne apni team main kai ratan jade the or har ratna apane apane halake kaa maharathi bataaya gaya
 According to the petition filed in the Supreme Court, Deshmukh formed a group called Image and then opened the company in the name of Aryarup Tourism and Club Resort Private Limited
 is company ne apana dhandha hotel, resort, entertenment park or gym bananaa bataaya, lekin usame nivesh kii aad main paisa batorne ke skim gadhi
 Deshmukh's business was a chit fund, where an investor had to form a chain of members after becoming a member of the company
 jitne sadsy utana kamishan
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court further stated that Deshmukh, the mastermind of the company, printed a souvenir to lure investors and published messages of big leaders in it
 apane sandesh main kai netaaon ne company ke kaamkaaj kii saraahna kii, jisase or bhi adhik niveshak deshmukh kii taraf khinchate chale aae
 Apparently, many of these leaders probably will not know what scams their messages are being offered
 netaaon kii chamak jab kam padane lagi, to deshmukh sahab ne dhandha or jamaane ke liye bollywood ko apane manch par utaara
 But the real thorn was being lured to investors, whose lifetime earnings had been locked in Deshmukh's fist
 zaahir taur par mutthi jab khuli, to khak ho gai
 As the real face of Deshmukh started to appear in the market, the line started to return the money to the investor
 company ke daftar ke shater girane lage

 The DM, SSP and SP force entered the Jawahar Bagh from the main gate and asked the loudspeakers to surrender the people empty the garden

 Significantly, due to the uproar in opposition to FDI by BJP and other opposition parties, the Lok Sabha proceedings could not go on for the last two days
 vipakshi dal is mudde par niyam 184 ke tahat charchaa karaane par ade hai
 There is a provision for division of votes in the House in this rule, which will determine whether the government is in majority

 But as an Indian citizen, it's my right to ask question about fake promises
 If u are ruling India for last 5yrs so u can ask votes for ur work instead of abusing Manmohan Singh Ji or any1 else

 unki maa premalata yadav pichley 10 saal se itawa jila panchayat adhyaksh hai, jo is baar apane bete kii khatir chunaav maidan se dur hai
 If Premlata is not contesting elections for her son, Mridula Yadav, grandson of Mulayam Singh and mother of Tej Pratap Singh Yadav alias 'tej', a member of Mainpuri MP, is set to inherit her husband's legacy
 unhone 3 aktubar ko badi saadagi ke saath saifai gram sabha ke ward number 10 se kshetra panchayat sadsy (bidisi) ke liye apana namakan bharaa

 Recently, the Supreme Court had ruled Johnson's decision wrong

 However, opposition mps and several members of his own party accused him that the Prime Minister did this to avoid a parliamentary inquiry into the difficult phase ahead of the Brexit deadline
 bataa den, britain ke supreme court ne ek aitihaasik faisle main kaha kipradhanmantri boris johnsanka desh kii sansad ko brexit kii samay seemaa se pehle paanch hafte ke liye nilambit karnaa yaa sthagit karne kaa faisla gaiyrkanoonee he
 On August 28, Johnson ordered Parliament to be suspended for five weeks
 yah aadesh 10 sitambar se lagu hua
 Giving the judgment of 11 judges of the Supreme Court, Supreme Court President Brenda Hale said, "the Prime Minister's advice to the Queen was illegal, null and ineffective
" iskaa matlab he ki sansad nilambit karne kaa aadesh gaiyrkanoonee, nirarthak or prabhaavaheen he or ise radd kiya janaa chahie

 Compared to last year's kharif season, this time 10 million tonnes of food grains are expected to be produced more

 9 crore 38 lakh 80 thousand tons of rice is estimated to be produced in the Kharifcision of 2016-17
 ye oltime record utpaadan hoga
 Earlier in the year 2011-12, a record production of 9 crore 27 lakh 80 thousand tons was produced

 Maize production is likely to reach a record production of 1093 million tonnes
 daalon kii buvaai is baar takreeban 35 fisadi zyada rahi he or isi vajah se chaalu kharif sijan main 87 lakh ton daal kaa utpaadan hone kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he jo apane main record utpaadan hoga

 lekin, kya aap ye jaanate hai ki tulsi kii puja main koun se niyamon kaa paalan jaruri he or ravivaar ko tulsi kaa patta kyon nahin todna chahie
 
 
 According to Vishnu Purana, Tulsi leaves should not be broken during Sundays, Ekadashi, Dwadashi, Sankranti, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse and evening
 manyata ke anusaar darasal, tulsi maa ekadshi vrath karti hai or isliye unhen todakar pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa
 Breaking of leaves on Ekadashi leads to poverty in the home
 thik usee prakaar ravivaar ko bhi tulsi kaa patta todane kii manaahi hoti he
 Sunday is the beloved war of Vishnu
 aise main lakshmi ke rup tulsi ko is din todna unka apmaan karne jaisaa he
 Tulsi does not break even on Tuesday due to brutal attacks in many places
 tulsi kaa patta bina snaan kiye nahin todna chahie
 According to the scriptures, if a person breaks the basil leaves without bathing, then such leaves are not accepted by God in worship
 tulsi ke patton ko 11 dinon tak basi nahin mana jaataa he
 It can be offered again to God by sprinkling water on its leaves everyday
 shivaji, ganeshji or bhairavaji ko tulsi nahin chadhaani chahie
 You can watch the video of the entire incident by yourself

 com / tbqxjip0s7 hajaaron khwahishen aisi, ye saali jindagi or inkaar jaisi filmein banane sudhir mishra ab apni film 'das dev' ke saath darshakon ke bich laut rahe hai
 The film will be released on April 27
 is film main rahul bhatta, richaa chaddha or aditi raav hydari najar aaenge
 Sudhir Mishra had a special conversation with India Today about his film
 sawaal: kya sharat chandra chattopadhyaay ke clasik ne aapako aakarshith kiya
 You have wanted to make a film on Devdas for a long time
 ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki aap 'or devdas' bananaa chaahate the, lekin dev di banane ke baad nahin banaai?sudhir mishra:devdas main dev kaa kairactor mujhe aakarshith karata rahaa he
 But it is also ahead of Lovestory
 ye ek tarah kaa saamaajik sanrachana ho bataata he, jisamen pyaar naammumkin he
 Especially for women of that time
 ye sahi he ki jab anuraag dev di bana rahe the, tab main is noval ko adept karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 But then some ideas came to my mind and everything changed
 ye mujhe shakespeare ke hemelet ke kareeb laga
 Shakespeare started wandering in my mind
 maine sochaa ki kyon na meri film chandramukhi naret kare
 In marriage, Karan, Shweta Bachchan did dance, mother Jaya Bachchan performed Nazarwal:: It is true that Das Dev is Devdas
 jo ki power ke liye mahatvakankshi he
 You have taken the politics of Uttar Pradesh in the background
 ye angel lenaa kyon uchit laga?sudhir mishra:jo raajnneeti personal life ko prabhavit karti he, wo mujhe hameshaa dilachasp lagi
 When this angle came to my mind, i started thinking about it serially
 yadi devdas dev kii story he, jo das ban jaataa he to iskaa matlab he ki vah kuleen he or lat kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 He has his own sins
 aise main mere dimag main aayaa ki dev kis tarah apane aap ko das banane se bachaata he
 a man who was addicted to alcohol first, then got addicted to power and how powerful man is Dev
 ye story chahat, power or lat kii he
 Yes, it is true that it is on up's politics today, but it can be on politics anywhere
 sonam kapur kii shaadi main is gane par dance karenge karan johar!sawaal: : pratish nandi ne aapse 'sahab, bivi or gulam' kii rimek banane ke bare main baat kii thi
 But you did not take this idea forward
 aisa kyon?sudhir mishra:haa, ye behtareen film he
 When i think about it, it seems that it cannot be made any better than this
 isliye main ise chhod detaa hum
 If i thought it could be done any other way, i would definitely do it
 lekin jis tarah guru dutt ne ise banaaya, us tarah mimic nahin bana saktaa

 Mayawati, who was a four-time chief minister for one of her biggest rallies before voting for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, chose Saharanpur
 yah nirvachan kshetra un ilaakon main se ek he jahaan buudhvaar ko vidhansabha ke duusare charan main matdaan hona he
 In Saharanpur, 42 percent of the population is Muslim, 22 percent are Dalit - Mayawati's attention is very much towards the Muslims, while this time she does not want to lose even the Dalits who have made distance in the Lok Sabha elections
 saharanpur buudhvaar ko vot karegaa, jab pashchimi upi rajya kii 403 main se 67 siton par matdaan karegaa, pichley hafte 72 siton ke liye chunaav hue the
 For Mayawati, representing Dalits, these two phases are going to be easier than the remaining five because she is popular in the western part of the state anyway
 yahaan daliton or musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 In the last assembly election, when Akhilesh Yadav had won a big victory, Mayawati had won four of the seven constituencies of Saharanpur
 saharanpur ke dakshin main mujffarnagar he jahaan 2013 ke dange abhi bhi upi kii raajnneeti main ek jwalanth mudda bane hue hai
 Around 60 people were killed in these riots, most of them Muslims and Akhilesh Yadav was accused of negligence and laxity in the proceedings
 sthiti ko shant karne ke liye sena tak ko bulaanaa pad gaya tha
 Most of the Muslims killed in the riots were of the Pasmanda caste, who belong to the Dalit or Backward Classes
 upi kii 18 pratishat aabaadi musalamaanon kii he jisamen 85 fisadi pasmanda jati ke hai or inamen se zyaadaatar ab mayawati ke kheme main aa rahe hai
 In rallies started from Saharanpur, Mayawati has been repeatedly assuring the Pasmanda Muslims that their anger is also the anger of the Dalits
 dalit or musalmaan milakar upi kii 20 karod kii jansankhya kaa chalis fisadi hissaa hai

 But how many Dalits have money in the bank? He would have named any other leader in his place

 ' daliton kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaaleen mayawati ke liye yah do charan baaki ke paanch charnon se zyada aasaan hone vaale hai kyonki vah rajya ke pashchimi ilaake main vaise bhi lokapriy hai
 Dalits and Muslims are more in number here
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jab akhilesh yadav ne badi jeet hasil kii thi, tab mayawati ne saharanpur kii hi saat main chaar kshetron main jeet darj kii thi
 To the south of Saharanpur is Muzaffarnagar where the 2013 riots still remain a burning issue in UP politics
 in dangon main kareeb 60 log maare gaye the jinamein se zyaadaatar musalmaan the or akhilesh yadav par laaparvaahee or kaarywahi main dhilaai kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 To calm the situation, even the army had to be called
 dangon main maare gaye musalamaanon main zyaadaatar pasmanda jati ke the jo dalit yaa pichhadaa varg main aate hai
 Muslims constitute 18% of the population of UP, of which 85% are of Pasmanda caste and most of them are now joining Mayawati's camp
 saharanpur se shuru hui reliyon main mayawati baar baar pasmanda musalamaanon ko yah aashwaasan detii aa rahi hai ki unka gussa daliton kaa bhi gussa he
 Dalits and Muslims together constitute forty percent of up's 200 million population
 mayawati ko ummid he ki utpeedan or jatigat hinsa jaise mudde donon hi shreniyan jhel rahi hai or shaayad is baar mayawati ko iskaa phayda mil sake
 This is his strategy to stay in politics
 haalanki duusari taraf musalamaanon ko akhilesh yadav apane paale main khinchne kii koshish kar rahe hai, or jaisaa ki jagajaahir he ki kis tarah loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke samarthan main daliton ne mayawati se bhi munhmod liya tha
 'in 2014, there was a reflection of economic aspirations in the Dalit votes
 2017 main yah bijli, sadak, pani or usase bhi zyada kanoon or vyavastha jaise muddon ke ird-gird ghoomane vaale hai
 This is said by Ashok Singh, a school teacher in Rampur in western UP
 unka kahana he ki 'dalit ladakiyon kaa har din balaatkaar ho rahaa he lekin hamen exiaar darj karne se roka jaataa he kyonki police thanon par gaiyr daliton kaa raaj he
 But at the same time if something happens to the upper caste girl, then riots happen
 ' ashok kehete hai ki 'modi ji bataur pradhanmantri acha kaam kar rahe hai, lekin unka rajya main koi kaam nahin he
 Behenji will become a better Prime Minister
 ' Mayawati did not get one of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state after PM Modi's appeal for a good day in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne 72 siten jhatki thim
 Mayawati's own Jatav caste (leather workers), who constitute 55 percent of the Dalit population, also turned away from their leader in that election
 2014 main mayawati ke 16 pratishat jatav vot bijepi kii jholii main gire the
 But this time it will not happen
 college main padhane vaale deepak kehete hai 'jatvon ne soch liya he ki vah bijepi ko haraane vaale hai kyonki yah party dalit virdohi he
 Like his colleagues, Deepak is also active on social media and last year he campaigned vigorously on Facebook and whatsapp about Rohit Vemula's suicide and Una Dalit atrocities
 kuch hafte pehle hi aresas ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne jaipur litarechar festival main aarakshan par bolte hue kaha tha ki itane saalon main iskaa koi phayda nahin hua
 In this case it needs to be considered
 mayawati ne turant pratikriya dete hue kaha tha ki bijepi ek oonchi jati or dalit virdohi party he
 Though the RSS had given clarification on this, but by then Mayawati had gone her way
 isi tarah ke kuch vivaad shaayad bijepi ke dalit voton ko apni taraf khinchne kii koshish ko naakaam kar sakate hai
 While the Jatavs are returning to Mayawati, the BJP is now eyeing non-jatavs, 45% of whom supported the party in 2014
 yahi vajah he ki 85 arakshit siton main se party ne 21 hi jatvon ko di he jabaki unki aabaadi rajya main dalit jansankhya ke aadhe se bhi zyada he
 Moving aside from the Dalit votes, the support of Muslims towards Mayawati is increasing - in 2012 she had 20 percent Muslim votes
 or is samarthan ke peeche bada haath pasmanda samudaay kaa he
 The rich Muslims are still enjoying the SP
 saharanpur kii ek uniwarsity main varisht professor khalid anis ansaari kehete hai 'oonchi jati ke musalmaan, pasmanda musalmaan kii bajaay hindu obisi ummidavaar ko vot dena zyada pasand karenge
 For example, Haji Iqbal, a BSP candidate from Behat, belongs to a backward caste Bandkuchi (bird catcher)
 unke nirvachan kshetra main 1
 There are 4 lakh Muslims, out of which only 15,000 are upper caste Pathans and Peerzade but despite this they will not vote for Haji even if the rest of the community votes for him
 ' amir or garib musalamaanon ke bich muddon or ummidavaaron kii pasand ko lekar is antar se bijepi ko phayda mil saktaa he
 The comments daliton ke saath saath musalamaanon ko bhi apni taraf karne kii koshish main mayawati ko in donon virgon ke bich ke faasale ko mitaanaa hoga
 Violence between Dalits and Muslims has been seen in many surrounding districts for several months after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 aise main inamen se kuch log maanate hai ki aarthik majbootee agenda hona chahie jo ki mayawati ke abhiyaan main nahin dikh rahaa he, vahiin bijepi or akhilesh yadav lagaakaar parivartan or vikaas ko apana ahm vaada banaae hue hai
 Kanwal Bharati, a Dalit writer from Rampur, said - 'mayawati will have to talk about development
 iske saath hi apni raajnneetik shatruon ke khokhalepan ko bhi saamne laana hoga
 For example, the PM launched an app named Bhima for cashless transactions which is named after Ambedkar
 lekin kitne daliton ke paas bank main paisa he? vah unki jagah kisi bhi or netaa kaa naam rakh dete
 If politicians want to add Ambedkar's name to a scheme, then it should be related to education and jobs
 ' Most of the Muslims killed in the riots were of the Pasmanda caste, who belong to the Dalit or Backward Classes
 upi kii 18 pratishat aabaadi musalamaanon kii he jisamen 85 fisadi pasmanda jati ke hai or inamen se zyaadaatar ab mayawati ke kheme main aa rahe hai

 dalit or musalmaan milakar upi kii 20 karod kii jansankhya kaa chalis fisadi hissaa hai
 Mayawati hopes to face both categories of issues like oppression and caste violence and perhaps this time Mayawati can get the benefit

 cricket kaise shuru hua, kyon shuru hua, iskaa koi pukhta saboot nahin he
 But, between and but cricket, along with its luck, has brightened the fortunes of many players
 cricket kii shuruyaat england main hui thi
 The first formal cricket Test match between England and Australia was played on 15 March 1877

 chaar saal ke baad cricket worldcup shuru hua tha
 The first Cricket World Cup was played in 1975 in England
 pehla match bharat or england ke bich lords ke maidan par 7 june 1975 ko khelaa gaya tha
 India had no experience of playing one-day matches
 worldcup match khilne se pehle bharat sirf do match khelaa tha or donon hi match england se haar gaya tha
 There was a lot of pressure on India
 england jaisi team ke saamne bharat kamjor nazar aa rahaa tha
 In the first match of the World Cup, India were badly defeated by England by 202 runs
 us vakt ek-divasiy match 60 over kaa hua karata tha
 England, batting first, scored a mammoth score of 334 runs in 60 overs
 lekin bharat puure 60 over khelte hue teen wicket par sirf 132 ran bana paaya tha
 India played very slowly due to lack of experience of the Indian batsmen
 us match main sunil gavaskar ne kaaphi dhime khelaa tha
 Gavaskar, opening the innings, played a full 60 overs but scored just 36 runs in 174 balls, which included just one four
 bharat is match ko jeetna nahin chahta tha, balki wicket bachaana chahta tha
 At that time, playing a full 60 overs was a big thing for a team like India
 mohinder amarnath worldcup itihaas ke pehle bowler the, jinhonen pehla wicket lene kaa record banaaya tha
 In this match against England, Amarnath achieved this feat by dismissing John Jameson
 usee tarah england ke ballebaaj denis amis pehle ballebaaj the, jinhone worldcup main pehla shatak thoka tha
 In this match against India, Dennis scored a brilliant 137 runs
 bharat kaa duusare match east-africa jaisi kamazor team ke saath 11 june 1975 ko tha
 east-africa batting first 55
 3 over main sirf 120 ran banaae or ol out ho gai 
 India did not have a big target
 bharat ke openar sunil gavaskar or faruk ejeeniyar ne shandaar batting karte hue bina wicket khoye 29
 India won in 5 overs
 gavaskar 65 ran or ejeeniyar 54 ran par naabad rahe the
 This was the first half-century of Gavaskar and the one-day career of the engineer
 bharat ne apana teesraa match newzealand ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 Batting first, India had a target of 231 runs against New Zealand
 newzealand ke openar glen turnar shandaar khelte hue 144 ran par naabad rahete hue newzealand ko jeet dilaai thi or is haar ke saath bharat 1975 ke worldcup se baahar ho gaya tha
 The first final of World Cup history was played between Australia and the West Indies on 21 June 1975 at Lord's ground
 australia ne toss jeetne ke baad west-indies ko ballebaaji ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 The start of the West Indies did not go well
 50 ran par west-indies teen wicket kho chukaa tha, lekin west-indies ke captain clive loyad ne shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue 85 gendon par 102 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 The West Indies had scored 291 runs for eight wickets playing 60 overs
 england kii team 292 ran kaa peechha karte hue 58
 He was all out for 274 in 4 overs, and West Indies made history by winning the first World Cup by winning by 17 runs
 west-indies ke captain cliv loyad ke shandaar shatak kii vajah se unhen 'main of da match' kaa kitaab mila tha

 What sources did they use? i see a tendency to exaggerate myself in all these things
 ' He said that the family had information about the book coming to the market and when he asked Baru when the book would arrive, he said, "it is natural that after the election

 At the same time the police arrested the accused teacher by laying a trap

 This was the thief who carried out the crime in the blink of an eye
 dilli ke logon ke man main is chor kaa khauf tha
 Famous as Super Thief, this thief is named Bunty Chor
 banty ne apane naam chori ke kai ibaarat likhi
 This thief had become so famous that the film was not made on this thief
 balki rielity sho main bhi banty chor batair contestes ke taur par gaya
 The stories of Bunty's theft were so interesting that even the policemen used to listen to their stories with their ears
 dikhne main smart, tej-tarraar super chor banty itnaa shaatir tha ki saamne vaale kii ankhon main dhul jhonkkar kab nikal jaataa tha
 He did not even think about it
 yahi vajah thi ki is shaatir chor ke naam par 500 se zyada chori kii vaardaat hai
 Many times the police came close to him, but with the help of his new idea, he proved to be twenty-one in front of the police each time
 kaaphi saalon kii mashkkat ke baad aakhirkaar is chor ko dilli police ne pakadaa, jiske baad dilli police or dilli waalon ne raahat kii saans lee
 Bunty thief was caught, but his exploits taught many more thieves to follow his path
 bhale hi wo banty jaise shaatir naa ho, lekin us jaise karname karke dilli police ke liye sirdard jarur bane hue hai
 One such thief who has gone on the path of Bunty, who aims to be a bigger thief than Super Thief Bunty, has now carried out more than 100 incidents
 wo daawa karata he ki wo top 10 choro main shaamil he, jisase pakadana mushkil hi nahi naammumkin he, jisane banty se chori karnaa to siikhaa hi saath hi police ke aakhon main kaise dhul jhonkani he wo bhi wo bakhubi jaanata he
 On being caught, he makes an excuse for such a disease that the police fear him and then he commits another crime

 All this is happening due to the international market

 That is, the price of oil did not rise

 While this has brought joy to the lives of many frustrated couples with rent-related techniques, it is also being criticized for its excessive misuse and various ethical issues involved
 isamen kaha gaya he ki mahatvapurn ling chayan or saamaanya garbh dhaaran vaale maamalon main bhi iskaa upyog kiye jane jaisi samasyaayein aa rahi hai

 The bill is to determine the conditions under which rent can be taken
 isamen kiraaye par kokh dene kaa anivaary panjikaran kaa upbandh bhi shaamil he
 Also, the bill includes making gender selection a crime in the womb of rent
 vidheyak main yah bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki yadi kiraaye kii kokh dene kaa kaary saunpane vaale mata-pita apane vivaah viched, mrityu yaa kisi bhi kaaran se bachche ko apni dekharekh main lene main asamarth yaa vifal rahete hai, to pehle se hi ek vaikalpik abhibhavak niyukt kiya jaae, jo bachche kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari le
 It also states that a child born through levitation on rent in India will be allowed to enter the country as an organic baby
 isamen kaha gaya he ki yadi kiraaye par kokh dene kaa kaary saunpane vaale mata-pita aise bachche main kisi bhi janmajaat vikruti yaa rog ke kaaran bachche ko lene se inkaar karte hai, to unhen saadhaaran karawas jo do saal se kam nahin hoga yaa pachaas hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana yaa donon se dandit kiya jayega

 Chola has the story of a teenager who is fleeing to a big city with her boyfriend

 12_) on Oct 17, 2018 at 9:37am PDT Nitin was carrying mud outside his village of his father, Banwari Lal Jatav, when the village headman came on the spot and gave him the good news
 pradhan ne bataaya ki jodhpur se phone aayaa he ki nitin kaa chayan iaiti main ho gaya he
 The father is a laborer in MGNREGA and recently the son too joined labor work with his father after taking the IIT examination
 dalit hone kii vajah se nahin lagegi baari bharkam fisbanavaari laal bete ko lekar gaanv pahunche to dekhte-dekhte puure gaanv main jashn kaa maahaul ban gaya
 Nitin says that he is a dalit student, so IIT will not have to pay a heavy fee
 phir bhi iaiti jaisi padhai ke liye paise kaa jugad karnaa uske liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 Nitin has done IIT and is also very happy, but at the same time the worry of expensive higher education is haunting him
 nitin ke parivaar ko he kisi bhamashah kii talashnitin kaa maananaa he ki koi na koi bhamashah madad kar degaa jaisaa abtak hota aayaa he
 Nitin's family is very poor
 ghar main teen bhai or do bahanen or hai
 Their responsibility is on the father
 pita-putr ne khud komanaregaa main mazdooreekarne ke liye registerd kar rakhaa he
 Whenever the number comes, they make their living by working in it
 pipehara gaanv main chai khushiyon kii lahargaanv ke bete neiiti main499waan rank laayaa he, ye puure pipahera gaanv ke liye garv kii baat he
 Happiness is being celebrated all over the village
 nitin padhai main to behad hoshiyaar tha magar ghar kii mali haalat behad kharaab thi
 Nitin's father Banwari Lal Jatav told that he has been a brilliant student since childhood
 padhai ke baad samay milane par mere saath kaam main haath bhi bantaata tha
 Nitin's focus father was on education since childhood, he says that despite working all day, he used to take time for studies
 nitin gaanv waalon kaa bhi shuru se hi pyaara tha
 The villagers say that Nitin used to pay attention only to studies and did not have any fun
 navoday vidhyalay kaa chaatr rahe hai nitinnitin ke pita or bhai rajan kehete hai ki parivaar kii haalat kharaab hone se hamaare saamne bete ko padhaane kaa sankat ban gaya, lekin hamane haar nahin maani or din-raat mazdooree karte hue pehle kendriyanvoday vidhyalayamen uskaa daakhila dilaayaa
 Where he scored 85 per cent in the 10th and 84 per cent in the twelfth
 jodhpur ke super therty main kii thi taiyaariuske baad nitin kii tamanna iti main jane kii hui lekin phir vahi paise kii kami ke chalate parivaar kaa bharan poshan karnaa durlabh ho gaya

 Nitin now wants to settle down in a good place by teaching and teaching the rest of his siblings
 upi ke chandauli main prem prasang main raaj khulne ke dar se ek premi ne apane premika ke bhai kii hatya kar di
 Actually, the girlfriend's brother had come to know the secret of both of them
 usne gharavaalon ko ye baat bataane kii dhamkee di thi
 The police have registered a case against the accused lover and arrested him
 jaankaree ke mutabik,jile ke alinagar thana kshetra main rahane vaala niraj apane pados kii ladki se pyaar karata tha
 Both also used to message each other on mobile
 ek din ladki ke bhai ne uske premi kaa massej dekh liya
 Talked about their relationship with family members
 dari hui premika ne turant premi ko ye baat bataai
 After that, for fear of revealing the secret, the lover Neeraj Nekhafnakaplan
 usne premika ke bhai arvind urf chotu ko cold drink main bhaang milakar pilaa diya
 When Chotu became drunken, he was pushed and dropped in the river Ganges
 police ke mutabik,parijanon ne thane main chotu kii gumshudagi kii report darj karai thi
 In the subsequent investigation, Chhotu's sister was suspected
 uske mobile kol kii detail jaanch karne par premi bhi shaq ke ghere main aa gaya
 He has confessed his crime after strictly questioning
 hatiya vidhansabha upachunaav ke nattejey ne congress or bhaajapa kii neend uda di he
 Naveen Jaiswal of All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU) Party defeated Ajay Nath Sahdev of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVMO) by 11,000 votes and won the victory
 jabaki jeet kaa dam bharne vaale ranchi se saansad or paryaton mantri subodh kaant sahay apane chote bhai sunil sahay ko haarane se nahin bachaa sake
 That too at a time when he was fiercely politicized from Ranchi to Delhi for tickets
 sunil 21,578 voton main hi simat gaye
 He could not get special votes even from those areas of Hatia, which are considered to be his strong brother's stronghold
 pichley ek saal se hatiya upachunaav kii jor-shor se taiyaari kar rahi bhaajapa tisare number par khisak gai
 His candidate Ramjilal Sarada received 26,151 votes
 philhal bhaajapa is baat se khush he ki isse sahay kaa kad na keval chota hua balki congress chauthe paaydaan par ludhak gai
 There is a lot of chaos in both the parties about the defeat in the cell
 1977 main hatiya ke vidhansabha kshetra banane ke baad pehali baar aisa hua he ki kisi kshetreey dal ne is seat par apni jeet darj kii
 Otherwise, Congress or BJP had been winning from here
 lambey arase tak subodh kaant hatiya kaa pratinidhitiv karte aa rahe the or baad main sarada ne is seat par teen baar jeet darj kii 2005 or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main hatiya main congress ke haathon haar chuki bhaajapa ne is baar is seat ko jeetne ke liye morchabandi kii thi
 But the leadership of the state BJP and Congress had no idea that AJSU would make a dent in their stronghold in this manner
 pichley chunaav main 22,847 vot hasil kar tisare number par rahe jaiswal ne congress ke paramparaagat muslim vot sahit bhaajapa ke vaisya maton or in donon partiyon ke shahari vot bank main khatarnaak sendhamari kii
 Different arguments are being made in the Congress and BJP about the vote breach and defeat, but Jaiswal stated the reasons for his victory very clearly and directly
 ve kehete hai, ''main pichhali baar haarane ke baad se hi lagaataar kaam kar rahaa tha
 He wanted to win over someone who could bring change
 yuva hamaare saath the, yahi hamaara mudda bhi tha
 "the head of the AJSU party and the Deputy Chief Minister of the state, Sudesh Kumar Mahato, through Hatia has already indicated that the party is moving towards increasing its numbers in the 2014 assembly elections
 ve kehete hai, ''yah hamaare liye ek prayog tha jo kaaphi phydemand rahaa
 "while the BJP fielded a weak candidate, the Congress gave tickets to a novice whose only deposit was to be his brother's union minister
" isse subodh kaant kii pratishtha ko to batta laga hi, party main unke aalochak khul kar jubaani jang par utar aae hai
 The angry Congress leader Pratibha Pandey left the party
 sunil kii ummidavaari par party main kalah is str tak rahi ki unki haar ko subodh kaant kii nijee haar ke taur par pesh kiya gaya
 Despite the strong efforts to show unity, the infighting and tussle in BJP was also visible
 party ke do netaaon ne haar ke do alag-alag kaaran bataae
 State BJP President Dineshanand Goswami clarifies, "the loss of urban voters has led to our defeat
" hamaare star prachaarak arjuna munda kaa swasthya kaarnon se prachaar se alag rahanaa bhi ghaatak siddh hua
 The biggest thing is that during the election we could not attack AJSU in a better way
 '' sarada haar kii ek or vajah bataate hai, ''mujhe kendriya netritv se puraa sahyog mila, lekin rajya str par maine samanvay kii kami mahasoos kii
 "if Hatia's mandate was not against the Arjun Munda government, it was at least an expression of people's anger against these two national parties
 bidambnaa yah ki bhaajapa ke liye haar kaa silsilaa tham nahin rahaa jo jamshedpur loksabhaa upachunaav se shuru hua tha
 It seems that Ajsu and Jhavimo will decide the direction of the upcoming politics of Jharkhand
 shaayad bhaajapa or congress is baat ko na maane lekin is sachaai ko samajhati hai
 The election of a house which was considered high in politics and the intention of its formation was that it would rise up from the populace of the elected people and consider the policies, the election of that house was unethical and plundered like the general elections
 Is full of kis
 aaj se nahin balki jamaane se rajyasabha ke chunaav main yahi hota aa rahaa he
 Since this has already happened and everyone does the same, this argument has justified every wrong
 aniatikta hi raajnneeti kii naitikta he
 Those who see politics from the platform of morality, they are doomed to be cheated at all times and from every party
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav phir se yaad dilaa gaya ki vaicharik or sanvaidhanik naitikta kuch nahin hoti
 Reminds every time and every time the public forgets
 janata ko sab pataa hota he isliye wo bhul jaati he kyonki janata hameshaa naitikta ko vyaavhaarik nazar se dekhati he
 He does not have an idealistic standard
 wo netaa se paise leti he, sharaab leti he or vaicharik opium leti he taaki wo kisi na kisi se nafrat kaa nasha paal sake
 In return, she also loots the system that the leader loots
 naukarshahi kaa tantra nirjeevon se nahin bana hota
 The people of India are not naive
 sayaani he
 She knows everything, so she too becomes the beneficiary of this corrupt politics
 wo rose dekhati he ki uskaa ek hissaa bin pani ke mar rahaa he, ek hisse ke paas acha skool nahin he, bazaar kii sadakon par chalane kii jagah nahin he, aspataal ilaaj karne main sakasham nahin hai, phir bhi wo raajnneetik dalon se milane vaale rishwat ko chhod nahin paati
 He has the extreme endurance to enter into the politics of hate and argue, but there is no way to remove the layers of immorality
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav bataata he ki hamaara loktantr raajnneetik dalon ke giroh main funs gaya he
 The fight for communalism is only for poor Hindus and Muslims
 vahi iske kilaaf ladata he or vahi maaraa jaataa he
 Politics deals in the name of fighting and consumes cream
 raajnneeti ek dhandha he or is dhandhe main sab vyapaaree hai
 Whose religion is profit congress ke vidhayakon ne sabit kar diya ki ve vichaardhaara se zyaada bikna pasand karte hai
 There is no benefit in paying attention to the excuse given by the Congress leaders of Haryana Congress
 inhen nataraj pencil tohafe main bhijwa deni chahie
 Must have written with a pencil! Ajit Jogi must be laughing that he is out of the Congress by rebelling and he is rebelling within the Congress
 baghaavat kaa tu in van radio congress kii khoj he
 People who have become leaders in the name of caste fraternity know that ideology is a matter of two-fold
 hooda ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he, phir bhi unase vot lete samay virdohi ummidavaaron ko sankoch na hua
 What a deal Hooda would have made in return for this vote
 congress ne samarthan kise diya? aarake anand ko
 Anand was claiming the support of INLD, whose leader was sent to the jail by Hooda
 wo aadmi congress daftar main dharmanirpekshata kii duhai de rahaa tha
 Hooda proved his absolutism! congress ne karnataka main kya kiya? jedies ke vidhayakon ke apni party chhod congress ke prati anuraag ke kya naitik kaaran rahe honge? paisa nahin to or kya? bijepi ne nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko utarkar koun sa khel khelaa sabko pataa he
 Why were independents fielded with money? In Jharkhand, voters were prevented from voting by issuing warrants against them
 congress bijepi kii tarah baaki dalon main unke kaaryakarta pasinaa bahaate rahe, lekin unke netaaon ko bachaane ke naam par dilli ke vakeelon ke giroh ne rajyasabha kii seat le lee
 There is nothing new in Indian politics
 nayaa ke naam par ekaadh jagah nae netaa aa jate hai, magar ab ye dal jang kha chuke hai
 The birth of new parties is very important for our democracy
 akhbaar uthaa kar dekhiye
 The same faces of leadership have occupied Indian politics for the last forty-fifty years
 wo itani baar se aa ja rahe hai, sab ek-duusare ke mulaaqaati hai
 Everyone has become the same
 rajyasabha ke chunaav ne thodi der ke liye yaad dilaane kii koshish kii he ki bhartiya raajnneeti main jhande ke rang alag hai, magar unako lekar chalane vaale sab ek jaise hai
 The comments ye sara sankat unke liye boj he, jo adarsh or naitikta ke paimaane se tamaam dalon ko dekhte hai
 stands by
 kisi bhi dal ko inaki koi zarurat nahin he, balki ye log sabhi dalon ke liye naitik sankat he
 Therefore, all are against them
 janata bagair naitik sankat ke jiti he
 Since when has the Lokpal law passed
 kya lokapal laane ke liye koi sangharsh he? bhrashtachar mit gaya he ye certificket baant dene ke baad rajyasabha kaa chunaav kya bhrashtachar mukt tha? i know the MLA will laugh after reading that it is still calling for morality with the help of the public
 ha ha, bilkul nahin
 i know that the gang whose chieftains make these games, that gang is formed from the public first
 jinhen naitikta kaa dard ho rahaa he unhen ek suzav he
 Become blind supporters of someone
 isse unhen na naitik sankat hoga, na vaicharik
 It is better to forget the election of Rajya Sabha
 yahi raajnneetik dalon kaa sabhi ko sandesh he
 India is the largest democracy in the world
 is mantra kaa din-raat jaap karne se man kaa santaap mitega or neend acchhee aegi
 Those who are not moral, do not chant the mantra in a democracy, count note
 aniatikta hi raajnneeti kii naitikta he
 Those who see politics from the platform of morality, they are doomed to be cheated at all times and from every party
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav phir se yaad dilaa gaya ki vaicharik or sanvaidhanik naitikta kuch nahin hoti
 Reminds every time and every time the public forgets
 janata ko sab pataa hota he isliye wo bhul jaati he kyonki janata hameshaa naitikta ko vyaavhaarik nazar se dekhati he
 He does not have an idealistic standard
 wo netaa se paise leti he, sharaab leti he or vaicharik opium leti he taaki wo kisi na kisi se nafrat kaa nasha paal sake
 In return, she also loots the system that the leader loots
 naukarshahi kaa tantra nirjeevon se nahin bana hota
 The people of India are not naive
 sayaani he
 She knows everything, so she too becomes the beneficiary of this corrupt politics
 wo rose dekhati he ki uskaa ek hissaa bin pani ke mar rahaa he, ek hisse ke paas acha skool nahin he, bazaar kii sadakon par chalane kii jagah nahin he, aspataal ilaaj karne main sakasham nahin hai, phir bhi wo raajnneetik dalon se milane vaale rishwat ko chhod nahin paati
 He has the extreme endurance to enter into the politics of hate and argue, but there is no way to remove the layers of immorality
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav bataata he ki hamaara loktantr raajnneetik dalon ke giroh main funs gaya he
 The fight for communalism is only for poor Hindus and Muslims
 vahi iske kilaaf ladata he or vahi maaraa jaataa he
 Politics deals in the name of fighting and consumes cream
 raajnneeti ek dhandha he or is dhandhe main sab vyapaaree hai
 Whose religion is profit congress ke vidhayakon ne sabit kar diya ki ve vichaardhaara se zyaada bikna pasand karte hai
 There is no benefit in paying attention to the excuse given by the Congress leaders of Haryana Congress
 inhen nataraj pencil tohafe main bhijwa deni chahie
 Must have written with a pencil! Ajit Jogi must be laughing that he is out of the Congress by rebelling and he is rebelling within the Congress
 baghaavat kaa tu in van radio congress kii khoj he
 People who have become leaders in the name of caste fraternity know that ideology is a matter of two-fold
 hooda ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he, phir bhi unase vot lete samay virdohi ummidavaaron ko sankoch na hua
 What a deal Hooda would have made in return for this vote
 congress ne samarthan kise diya? aarake anand ko
 Anand was claiming the support of INLD, whose leader was sent to the jail by Hooda
 wo aadmi congress daftar main dharmanirpekshata kii duhai de rahaa tha
 Hooda proved his absolutism! congress ne karnataka main kya kiya? jedies ke vidhayakon ke apni party chhod congress ke prati anuraag ke kya naitik kaaran rahe honge? paisa nahin to or kya? bijepi ne nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko utarkar koun sa khel khelaa sabko pataa he
 Why were independents fielded with money? In Jharkhand, voters were prevented from voting by issuing warrants against them
 congress bijepi kii tarah baaki dalon main unke kaaryakarta pasinaa bahaate rahe, lekin unke netaaon ko bachaane ke naam par dilli ke vakeelon ke giroh ne rajyasabha kii seat le lee
 There is nothing new in Indian politics
 nayaa ke naam par ekaadh jagah nae netaa aa jate hai, magar ab ye dal jang kha chuke hai
 The birth of new parties is very important for our democracy
 akhbaar uthaa kar dekhiye
 The same faces of leadership have occupied Indian politics for the last forty-fifty years
 wo itani baar se aa ja rahe hai, sab ek-duusare ke mulaaqaati hai
 Everyone has become the same
 rajyasabha ke chunaav ne thodi der ke liye yaad dilaane kii koshish kii he ki bhartiya raajnneeti main jhande ke rang alag hai, magar unako lekar chalane vaale sab ek jaise hai
 The comments ye sara sankat unke liye boj he, jo adarsh or naitikta ke paimaane se tamaam dalon ko dekhte hai
 stands by
 kisi bhi dal ko inaki koi zarurat nahin he, balki ye log sabhi dalon ke liye naitik sankat he
 Therefore, all are against them
 janata bagair naitik sankat ke jiti he
 Since when has the Lokpal law passed
 kya lokapal laane ke liye koi sangharsh he? bhrashtachar mit gaya he ye certificket baant dene ke baad rajyasabha kaa chunaav kya bhrashtachar mukt tha? i know the MLA will laugh after reading that it is still calling for morality with the help of the public
 ha ha, bilkul nahin
 i know that the gang whose chieftains make these games, that gang is formed from the public first
 jinhen naitikta kaa dard ho rahaa he unhen ek suzav he
 Become blind supporters of someone
 isse unhen na naitik sankat hoga, na vaicharik
 It is better to forget the election of Rajya Sabha
 yahi raajnneetik dalon kaa sabhi ko sandesh he
 India is the largest democracy in the world
 is mantra kaa din-raat jaap karne se man kaa santaap mitega or neend acchhee aegi
 Those who are not moral, do not chant the mantra in a democracy, count note
 bharat kii janata bholi nahin he
 Sayani use sab maaloom he isliye wo bhi is bhrasht raajnneeti kii labhaarthi ban jaati he
 She sees every day that a part of her is dying of water, a part does not have a good school, there is no place to walk on the streets of the market, hospitals are not able to get treatment, yet she meets political parties The people are not able to give up the bribe
 uske paas nafrat kii raajnneeti main ghus kar bahes karne kaa athaah dhiraj he magar aniatikta kii paraton ko hataakar dekhne kii beqaraari nahin he
 The election of Rajya Sabha suggests that our democracy is trapped in a gang of political parties
 sampradayikta kii ladaai sirf garib hindu-musalmaan ke liye he
 He fights against it and he is killed
 siyasatdan ladane ke naam par sauda karata he or malai kha letaa he
 Politics is a business and everybody is a businessman in this business
 munaafaa jiskaa dharm he
 Congress mlas have proved that they like to sell more than ideology
 haryana congress ke netaaon ne kalam kaa jo bahaanaa pesh kiya he, us par dhyaan dene se koi laabh nahin
 They should be sent in Natraj pencil gifts
 pencil se to likhni aati hogi! ajit jogi ko hansi aa rahi hogi ki ve baghaavat kar congress se baahar hai or ye baghaavat kar congress ke bheetar hai
 Rebellion's two in one radio is the discovery of Congress
 jaat birdari ke naam par netaa bane logon ko pataa he ki vichaardhaara do kaudi kii cheez he
 Investigations are going on against Hooda, yet opposing candidates were hesitant while taking votes from him
 hooda ne is vot ke badale kya sauda kiya hoga
 To whom did Congress support? RK Anand anand inelo kaa samarthan hone kaa daawa kar rahe the jiske netaa ko hooda ne hi jail bhijwaya
 The man was calling for secularism in the Congress office
 hooda ne apni nirpekshata kaa dharm sabit kar diya! What did Congress do in Karnataka? What moral reasons should JDS mlas leave their party and have an affection for Congress? What else if no money? Everyone knows which game the BJP played by taking out independent candidates
 nirdaleey ummidavaar paise vaale hi kyon utaare gaye? jharkhand main vidhayakon ke khilaaf warrant nikalava kar matdaan karne se roka gaya
 Like the Congress BJP, their workers in other parties kept on sweating, but in the name of saving their leaders, a gang of lawyers from Delhi took the Rajya Sabha seat
 bhartiya raajnneeti main nayaa nahin ghat rahaa he
 In the name of Naya, new leaders come to some place, but now these parties are rusted
 nae-nae dalon kii paidaaish hamaare loktantr ke liye bahut zaruri he
 Look at the newspaper
 netritv ke vahi chehre pichley chalis-pachaas saal se bhartiya raajnneeti par qaabiz hai
 They are coming from so many times, they all meet each other
 sab ek jaise ho gaye hai
 The Rajya Sabha elections have tried to remind for a while that the colors of the flags are different in Indian politics, but all those carrying them are the same
 tippaniyan This entire crisis is a burden for those who see all the parties on the scale of ideal and morality
 samarthan karte hai
 There is no need for any party, but these people are a moral crisis for all parties
 isliye inke khilaaf sab ho jate hai
 The public lives without moral crisis
 kab se lokapal kaa kanoon paas he
 Is there any struggle to bring Lokpal? After distributing this certificate, corruption was erased, was the election of Rajya Sabha free from corruption? mujhe pataa he vidhayak padhakar hansenge ki ye abhi bhi janata ke sahare naitikta kaa aahvaan kar rahaa he
 Haha, of course not
 mujhe pataa he jis giroh ke sardaar ye khel rachate hai, wo giroh pehle janata se hi banataa he
 Those who are suffering morality have a suggestion
 kisi na kisi ke andh samarthak ho jaaen
 This will neither cause them moral crisis nor ideology
 rajyasabha ke chunaav ko bhul janaa behatar he
 This is the message of all political parties
 bharat duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr he

 The sale of firecrackers has been banned by the Supreme Court on Diwali this year in Delhi NCR
 apane taaja aadesh main supreme court ne dilli main sabhi sthaayee or asthaayee license 1 november tak nilambit karne kaa aadesh diya he
 This Supreme Court order means that firecrackers in the national capital can sell firecrackers after November 1
 supreme court ke is faisle se pataakhaa kaarobaari behad niraash hai
 According to Narendra Gupta, president of the Sadar Bazar Cracker Association, “we are deeply disappointed by this decision of the Supreme Court
 yah hamaare saath anyaay he
 If the ban on the sale of firecrackers was to be banned completely, then why was the order removed on 12 September 2017
 ab hamane lakhon ke maal bhar liye hai
 If there is no sale, then where should we go with this? hamaara to lakhon kaa nuksaan ho jayega
 "the U-turn of the Supreme Court is that during the hearing of a petition on the issue of increased pollution after Diwali last year, the Supreme Court banned the sale of firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 haalanki 12 sitambar 2017 ko supreme court ne pataakhon kii bikri par pabandi vaale aadesh main sanshodhan kar diya or kuch sharton ke saath pataakhaa vikritaon ke asthayeelicense kii sankhya main 50 fisadi katauteekarne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Also, firecrackers were also banned from other states in delhi-ncr
 lekin somvaar ko supreme court ne ekbar phir november 2016 ke puraane aadesh ko behaal karte hue dilli-ensiaar main pataakhon kii bikri par puri tarah roak lagane kaa aadesh de diya he
 Out of business, in view of the previous order of the Supreme Court, only 24 temporary shops were given license to sell crackers in Sadar Bazar
 lekin ab supreme court ke taaja aadesh ke baad asthaayee pataakhaa vyapaariyon main naaraazgi he
 According to Harjeet Singh Chhabra of Chhabra Ji firecracker shop in Sadar Bazar, “this is utterly wrong
 hamen 15 meter kii duuri vaale cloj par asthaayee license mila tha
 Around 24 businessmen got temporary licenses after the September 12 order, which is valid till October 21
 ab aaj sun rahe hai ki bech hi nahin sakate
 So this injustice happened to us
 agar bain karnaa hi tha to phir hataaya kyon tha
 We would have set up a fight shop, do something else, now all the money was stuck
 "chuninda kaarobaari hi nahin hajaaron ho jaaenge berozegarpataakhaa kaarobaariyon kii maane to puri supreme court ke is faisle se na sirf pataakhaa kaarobaariyon kaa nuksaan hoga, balki hajaaron log berozegaar ho jaaenge
 Disappointed with the court's decision, traders said that we want the court to give relief to at least those traders who have filled the stock of firecrackers in their shops after the September 12 order
 unhen pataakhe bechney kii parmishan di jaae
 "traders say that only those people who buy firecrackers have a wedding or any ceremony after November 1
 pataakhaa kaarobaariyon ne samaadhaan na nikalne kii surat menvirodh-pradarshan kii bhi chetavaneedi he
 Government to file review petition: Confederation of All India Traders (CAT) has called the ban on selling cat crackers a fundamental right of traders, saying that the ban on selling firecrackers in Delhi NCR is a kind of constitutional right for traders to trade Is a violation of cat ke rashtriya adhyaksh bisi bharatiyaa evam rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne kaha ki supreme court ne pataakhe bechney par pratibandh lagaaya he, lekin pataakhe chhodane par nahin or iskaa laabh uthaate hue log dilli ke alaava anya rajyon se pataakhe kharidkar yahaan aatishbaajee kar sakate hai
 They say that if this happens, it will be an injustice to the traders of Delhi, because their trade will go to other states, which is not justified in terms of justice
 paryaavaran ke liye gaiyr-hanikaarak pataakhe bhi nahin chode ja sakengekait kaa kahana he ki dilli ensiaar main badi maatra main paryaavaran ko haani na pahunchane vaale pataakhe bhi aate hai, lekin supreme court ke taaja aadesh ke chalate aise gaiyr-hanikaarak pataakhe bhi nahin beche ja sakenge
 Many traders have called for the stock of firecrackers so far this Diwali, but those traders are bound to suffer a huge financial loss due to the sudden ban
 cat kaa kahana he ki paryaavaran ko nuksaan keval pataakhon se hi nahin, isliye paryaavaran ko lekar ek niti banaai jaani chahie or sarkaar ko supreme court main rivyuu petishan daakhil kar kam se kam is diwali ke liye pratibandh waapas lene kaa aagrah karnaa chahie
