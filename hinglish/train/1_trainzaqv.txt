 Why not asking for things like money, and prizes on social media is called a dispute, while talking about the right to play becomes a controversy

 Let me tell you that Saina Nehwal had expressed her displeasure in this regard by tweeting that the father did not get an entry in the Commonwealth Games Khel village
 Surprise to see that when we started from India for commonwealth games 2018 my father was confirmed as the team official and i paid the whole amount for that but when we came to the games village 
 
 
 his name was cut from team official category
 
 and he can't even stay with me

 He can't even meet me

 purv olympic or vishwa champion hidaayat ne indian badminton lig main menvideshi khilaadiyon ke sathbhedbhaav or kam rakam milane kii shikaayat kii thi
 Saina said that Hidayat should not forget that he has retired
 iske baad jwaala ne bina sina kaa naam liye twit kiya tha, 'toufeeq mahaan khilaadi hai or mujhe nahin lagata ki aap unki baat ko sirf isliye khaarij kar den kyonki vah ritair ho chuke hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali suraksha maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti (CCS) ne rafel ke ofaset saude main shaamil kathor sharton ko hataakar daso aviation or duusari company embidie ko asaadhaaran or abhootpurv raahat di thi
 This has been claimed in a report in the English newspaper The Hindu
 khabar ke anusaar, in donon companiyon ne 7
 On September 23, 2016, under the $ 87 billion Rafale deal, signed an offset agreement with the Indian government
 24 agast, 2016 ko raajnneetik nirnay lene vaali ucchstareey samiti ne yah raahat di thi
 Both companies were exempted from compliance with several provisions of the Standard Contract Document of the Defense Dealing Procedure (DPP-2013)
 chhot chaahane waalon ko khaskar do baton se pareshaani thi- arbitreshan ke liye ofaset contract main tay praavdhaan (anuchhed 9) or industrial saplyrs (anuchhed 12) ke bahi-khaaton tak pahunch
 Manohar Parrikar was hesitant! These waiver demands were sent by the Defense Procurement Council (DAC) headed by the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to the CCS for 'final review and approval'
 khabar main daawa kiya gaya he ki raksha mantri khud ise apane str par manjuuri dene main kaaphi asahajata mahasoos kar rahe the, kyonki yah raksha kharid prakriya se kaaphi hatakar kuch karne kii baat thi
 DAC silently removed two conditions Not only this, DAC quietly removed two more important mandatory conditions
 dipipi 2013 main is baat kaa sakht praavdhaan he ki contract main kisi tarah ke 'anuchit prabhaav kaa istemaal' nahin hoga or 'agent yaa agency ko kamishan' nahin diya ja saktaa
 It also provides that if any private industrial supplier violates it then punitive action should be taken against it
 lekin dissi ne in sharton ko chupchaap hataa diya
 Not only this, the need to get approval from CCS to remove it was not even considered
 akhbaar ke anusaar, sarkaar ne in mahatvapurn tathyon ko supreme court main di gai apni jaankaree main nahin bataaya he
 These major changes were made to the offset policy in August 2015 and it was included in the Indian Negotiation Team (INT) final report dated July 21, 2016
 rafel saude ke mutabik daso aviation (saath main uske 21 sab-vendor) ke dwaara embidie (saath main 12 sab-vendor) ke saath milakar kul contract vailu ke 50 fisadi tak ofaset sauda bharat main diya jayega
 It is worth about 30 thousand crore rupees and will be completed from the fourth year (october 2019) of the transaction to the seventh year, ie, in a total of three years
 yani isamen pehle teen saal main shunya dendaree hogi, jabaki saatven saal main 57 fisadi javabdehi kaa puraa karnaa hoga
 In the first three years, the two French companies will not contribute to Make in India
 badla gaya ofaset prastaavaianti kii final report se pataa chalata he ki daso aviation or embidie kaa shuruaati ofaset prastaav kuch or tha, lekin raksha mantralay kii 4 janvari, 2016 kii baithak main nirnay liya gaya ki francisi companiyon ko tatkaal nayaa ofaset prastaav jamaa karne ko kaha jaae
 Significantly, the campaign of Lok Sabha elections is going on throughout the country, in such a situation that the Modi government is giving evidence of development to the people by putting forth their welfare schemes, then the Congress has opened a front against the government on the Rafale deal

 In it, the party said that if the Supreme Court decides in favor of the Hindu, then the land will be given to the Hindus

 " a few months before the general election, the country's economy does not look as rosy as the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government would have wanted
 maal or seva kar (jiesti) ke jariye kar dhaanche ko aasaan banane ke daavon, nae diwalia kanoon ke jariye vittiya morche par kuch doorgaami sudhaaron or kaarykaal main adhikansh samay tak kachche tel kii naram keemton ke baavjood sarkaar daanwandol arthvyavastha se jujh rahi he
 The situation looks worse when it comes to regaining the shaky economy inherited from the UPA rule, achieving higher economic growth, coming to power on the promise of providing more jobs and a better lifestyle
 yah maayusi janvari 2019 ke 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey main bad-chadhakar saamne ai he
 While there is a general perception that the Modi government's economic performance has been better than the Congress-led UPA government, the number of those who believe it has decreased
 survey main shaamil 49 fisadi log ab bhi maanate hai ki bhaajapa kii aguai vaali endie sarkaar ne behatar kaam kiya he, par beete ek saal main aisa maanane waalon kii taadaad main saat fisadi kii giravat sarkaar ke liye baari chintaa kii baat hogi
 People as large as 28 per cent also feel that this government has done worse in terms of economic functioning, which is the largest number of those who believe in the last seven surveys
 kul milakar 41 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki aarthik morche par is sarkaar kaa pradarshan yaa to upie sarkaar ke samaan hi he yaa usase badtar rahaa he
 What are the reasons for this belief? 7 of the economy in this financial year
 2 fisadi kii raftaar se badaae kii ummid he, par iske anuroop oochaal or utsaah kaa ehsaas chaitarafa mahasoos nahin hota
 Whether it is a question of jobs, investment or new projects - it is generally a feeling that more could have been done
 sach to yah he ki centre for monitering indian iconomi (siemii) ke mutabik, 2018 ke aakhri teen maheenon main nai pariyojnaon main nivesh 2014 main bhaajapa ke satta main aane ke baad sabase nichle str par aa gaya
 The value of stalled projects has risen to the second highest level of the tenure of the current government
 rajkoshiya ghaataa in aath maheenon main lakshya ke 112 fisadi ke nishaan ke paar chalaa gaya
 The Care Ratings report says that there is a high probability that the Center will have a fiscal deficit of 3 this fiscal
 3 fisadi kaa lakshya puraa nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 The report says, "we 0 of GDP
 1 fisadi se 0
 Expect to fall around 2 per cent of the fiscal deficit, which 3 of GDP
 5 fisadi ke str par dhakel degi
 "GST collection could not sustain pace and disinvestment targets are still far out of reach
" pichhali baar kii tarah is survey main bhi kai logon ko lagata he ki jaruri chizon kii keemten bad gai hai, haalanki hakeekat yah he ki mahangaai niyantran main he or subjiyon sareekhee kuch chizon main to rinatmak mudrasphiti yaa apsfiti rahi he
 The assumption is that prices are going up and 68% of the people surveyed believe that the prices of essential commodities have increased in the last five years
 isaki vajah eendhan ke daam ho sakate hai jo kachche tel kii vaishvik keemton main narmi aane se pehle kai hafton tak oonche bane hue the
 There has also been a slight decrease in the number of people who believe that their economic condition (income and savings) has changed in the last five years
 haalanki 40 fisadi ne kaha ki is dauraan unki aarthik haalat main sudhaar aayaa he, jo pichley ek saal ke dauraan janvari 2018 ke 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey main aisa kehane waalon kii taadaad se chah fisad kam hai
 Corruption still remains an issue
 70 fisadi log kehete hai ki unki rosemara kii jindagi main darpesh bhrashtachar main koi kami nahin ai he
 More worryingly, 34 per cent of the people said that corruption has increased in the last five years
 naukariyaan awwal chinteylabatta sabase badi chintaa naukariyon ke srijan ko lekar he
 1
 2 karod nai naukariyon kaa sarkaar kaa vaada khud usee ke gale kii haddi ban gaya he
 It has always been said that there is no sure way to measure how many jobs were created in the country
 karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) ke sitambar 2018 ke perol data ke aadhaar par sarkaar kii daleel yah he ki aupchaarik kshetra main july ke maheene main kareeb 10 lakh naukariyon kaa srijan hua
 But the veracity of this figure has been questioned all-round and some economists said that this figure should not be misunderstood to understand the employment data, as the increase in names recorded in the EPFO suggests the conversion of informal workers into formal ones
 siemii ke mutabik, disambar 2018 ko khatm saal main 1 karod se zyada naukariyaan chali gayi jabaki berogari dar disambar main badhkar 27 maheenon ke sabase oonche str 7
 Reached 38 percent
 naukariyaan jane kii khaasi taadaad (83 fisadi) gramin ilaakon main rahi he
 This concern has also been expressed in the 'desh's mood' survey
 jab poocha gaya ki kya sarkaar zyada naukariyaan paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi kuch kar rahi he? to 46 fisadi ne kaha ki nahin, vah nahin kar rahi he
 However, those who feel that the government is doing a lot, their number has increased by 5 per cent as compared to 42 per cent of the previous survey of August 2018
 isaki ek vajah yah hogi ki sadakon or buniyadi dhaanche par sarkaar ke kharchon kii badaulat nirmaan kshetra main naukariyon main badhotaree ho rahi he
 The Modi government is aware that on the jobs front it is far from the intended position and hence there is a possibility that it will announce a tremendous recruitment drive to fill the vacant government post
 centre or rajya sarkaron main kul milakar 29 lakh se zyada ohade khaali pade hai
 If the government fills them, then it can cost 1 lakh crore rupees and there is a 76% increase in the budget of the center to distribute the salary
 saatven vetan ayog ne jo formula tajavij kiya he, uske mutabik ek karmchaaree kii shuruaati nunatam selleri 7,000 rupye se badhkar 18,000 rupye pratimah ho gai he
 Obviously, the government does not have the money to fill all the vacant positions, but BJP insiders see it as an important step to counter growth without jobs
 bhartee kii yah muhim madhyam varg ko dhyaan main rakhkar hone vaale ailaanon kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 In the 2018 assembly elections and especially in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the party had to face defeat in many urban areas

 Kilo onions are the main reason for the farmers' distress (even more for the farmers of North and South)
 pichley 2-3 saal main ek ke baad ek kai rajya sarkaron ne takreeban 1,80,000 karod rupye kii laagat se kisaanon ke liye karj maafee kaa elaan kiya he
 This is apparently a way to calm the anger of the farmers, as debt waiver rarely brings any change on the ground
 magar 68 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki karj maafee kisaanon kii mushkilon ko kam karne kii disha main sahi kadam he
 As far as the ease of doing business is concerned, 44 per cent of the people surveyed believe that it has become really easy to do business in the country, while 41 per cent answered 'no'

 The Supreme Court had to intervene, the Supreme Court had to issue a notice to the Government in September 2004, on a petition filed for proper justice to the widows of soldiers who were martyred in the War of Karkar
 tab supreme court ne raksha mantralay, petroleum mantralay or uttar pradesh sarkaar ko notice dekar poocha tha ki yuddh ke 5 saal baad inhen ab tak raahat or muawza kyon nahin diya gaya he

 Last month too, Tejashwi Yadav reached Bhagalpur during his mandate insult trip and there was a program to hold a public meeting in Sabour block regarding the creation scam but in the midnight drama, the district administration did not allow Tejashwi to hold this meeting and he Had to return empty handed
 tejasvi ne us vakt kaha tha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or upmukhyamantri susheel modi nahin chaahate hai ki is ghotaale ko lekar tejasvi bhagalpur main sabha karen
 Both Lalu and Tejashwi have alleged that the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi and many big leaders of BJP are involved in this scam of more than thousand crores
 philhal puure ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai kar rahi he
 a 6-member team from Delhi is presently present in Bhagalpur and is raiding at various places over the creation scam

 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey on the Table of the House on Thursday, a day before the General Budget
 is report main saamaajik kshetron or garibon kii behatari ke liye data taiyaar karne par jor diya gaya he
 The report says that governments already have administrative, survey, institutional and transaction data of citizens, but these need to be collected
 report ke mutabik alag-alag mantralayon main bikhare pade databes ko ek jagah ekatrit karke nagarikon ko behatar sevaaon kaa anubhav karaayaa ja saktaa he
 This is to say that through this the government can provide better service to its citizens
 iskaa phayda yah hoga ki garibon ke liye kalyankari yojanaon main galatiyon kii ashanka bhi kam ho jaaegi
 Government will interfere in private sector! Economic survey report recommends intervention in private sector
 report main kaha gaya ki jahaan phayda nahin hota he, vahaan nijee kshetra nivesh nahin karata he
 In such a situation, the government should now interfere in this area and data should be prepared
 survey ke mutabik nijee kshetra ne jahaan laabh dikhaa vahaan data jutaney main ullekhneey kaam kiya gaya he, lekin sarkaar ko un saamaajik kshetron main hastkshep karnaa chahie, jahaan data ekatrit karne ke liye nijee kshetra paryaapt rup se nivesh nahin ho paaya he
 The survey states that advanced technology is already available to protect privacy and share confidential information
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar niztaa kanoon ke daayre main nagarikon kii behatar ke liye data taiyaar kar sakati he
 Data should be collected by the people for the people
 survey main kaha gaya he ki jan kalyaan liye data ke bare main sochate hue is baat kaa khyaal rakhana hoga ki amiron kii niztaa kii praathamikta garibon par na thopi jaae
 The Economic Review states that the consent of the people should be taken while collecting data or the data should be collected by the states within the legal scope
 data collection kaa kaam chaar charnon-collection, storage, processing or vistaar- main kiya janaa he

 ‚Äô There is time to eat everything
 lekin export kuch chizon ko khaastaur par khaali pet lene se manaa karte hai
 Know what the reason is darasal,inamen wo tamaam chijen aati hai jo amleey hoti hai
 Eating anything acidic on an empty stomach affects the intestines and there is a risk of infection
 1
 Sodasoda contains high amounts of carbonate acid
 jab yah pet main maujuud amla ke saath miltaa he to pet dard jaisi kai pareshaaniyon ko janm detaa he
 2
 tamatarkache tamaato khaane ke kai phaayde hote hai lekin khaali pet kachche tamaato khaanaa nuksaandaayak ho saktaa he
 The acidity present in tomatoes interacts with the gastrointestinal acid present in the stomach to form a gel that causes problems such as abdominal pain, cramps
 khaali pet tamaato khaane se pathari hone kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 3
 davaaiyanapane aksar doctor ko ye kehete suna hoga ki kuch khaane ke baad hi davaaiyaan lenaa
 We are also told in our homes that no medicine should be taken on an empty stomach
 isaki mukhya vajah ye he ki khaali pet dawa lene se vah pet kii sabase andruni sataha ko prabhavit karti he or pet main maujuud acids ke saath kriya karke sharir ke santulan ko disturb kar detii he
 4
 alcoholkai logon ko khaali pet alcohol lenaa pasand hota he
 In such a situation, intoxication occurs quickly, but the intestines are badly affected by consuming alcohol on an empty stomach
 5
 Too much spicy food Most people like to eat spicy and spicy food, but such things should never be taken on an empty stomach
 hamaare sharir main prakritik rup se kuch acid maujuud hote hai
 The chemical reaction between this acid and spices by eating very spicy food has a bad effect on the intestines
 6
 Coffee: Consumption of empty stomach coffee can be harmful
 coffee main maujuud caffeine pet ke liye sahi nahin hota he
 If you have a habit of drinking coffee in the morning, then you first drink a glass of water
 uske baad hi coffee kaa cap len
 Similarly, tea intake should not be taken on an empty stomach
 khaali pet chaay pine se gas or kabj hone kii ashanka bad jaati he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke is faisle se sabase zyada khush argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav hai
 They believe that BJP has stopped giving Nitish Kumar a price tag
 vahiin, mukhyamantri or janata dal you ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki is tarah kaa koi prastaav unke paas aayaa hi nahin or na hi unhone is bare main dur-dur tak sochaa ki janata dal you kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil hoga
 Only BJP mps have participated in this expansion
 endie ke ghatak dal nahin, lekin iske baavjood nitish kumaar ke virdohi khush hai
 RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav even said that BJP no longer trusts Nitish Kumar, because he wants to strengthen himself by breaking Congress in Bihar
 bijepi is se sashankit he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav is constantly expressing his happiness with tweets
 halaki media main is baat kii lagaataar charchaa ho rahi thi ki janata dal you ke do mantrimodi cabinetmen shaamil honge
 Everyone was also mentioning the names according to their respective accounts
 janata dal you ke rajyasabha saansad aaaraseepi singh ko to log unke dilli awaas par jaakar badhai bhi dene lage, lekin jab vistaar se ek din pehle mukhyamantri kii ajtak se baat hui, to unhone kaha ki kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa koi prastaav hi nahin tha
 There was no conversation with anyone on this subject, but the other leaders of the Janata dal-u are not thinking what to answer? The party says that the NDA government was formed in Bihar just a month ago
 bijepi kii taraf se hi nitish kumaar ko netaa chunane kaa prastaav aayaa or unhone mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 BJP national president Amit Shah invited him to join NDA
 rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak ke baad 19 agast ko janata dal you aupchaarik rup se endie main shaamil ho gai
 Now there is talk of joining the Modi cabinet, when there was no talk among the big leaders on this subject and there was no proposal
 bijepi ne apane kisi ghatak dal ko prastaav nahin diya tha
 In such a situation, it cannot be said that the Janata Dal has been ignored

 com / hbcicstqoa No company in the world gives jobs to an employee without interviews
 kyonki intervyuu sirf karmchaaree ke bare main jaanane yaa usase milane ke liye nahin liya jaataa
 Bulk company high officials also know all about you on the pretext, which you never tell directly
 masalan, apane pehle offis kii kamiyaan ginanaa, apshabd kahana, phone par baat aadi
 Clean up Facebook before job interview, know why
 
 
 bas yaheen aap samaj nahin pate or intervyuu ke dauraan kuch galtiyaan kar baithte hai
 This is the reason that despite the ability, many people do not get jobs according to their mind
 jaaniye, intervyuu ke dauraan kin galatiyon se bachanaa chahie
 
 
 Keep these things in mind when filling form 1 of NEET
 intervyuu main chwing gam khate hue na jaaen
 This proves that you do not care for anyone
 iskaa intervyuu lene waalon par nakaaratmak asar hota he
 2
 kuch log intervyuu main apane pehle job ko jeebhar kar koste hai
 It also has a negative effect on interviewees
 kyoki har company ke niyam or unki vyavasthaaen lagbhag ek jaisi hi hoti hai
 Therefore, there is an increased chance of not getting a job
 safal udhyami banane ke liye chhodani hongi ye aadaten
 
 
 3
 aapke haavbhaav se intervyuu lene vaale vyakti ko yah nahin laganaa chahie ki aap ghamandi hai yaa is job main aapaki ruchi nahin he
 4
 intervyuu ke kapadon kaa sellection bhi samajhadaari se karen
 This can also be a reason for not getting a job
 Board Exam he najadik, aise karen apana time manage5
 Do not accidentally attend any phone call in the interview
 intervyuu ke baad aap bhale hi kol back kar sakate hai
 By doing this, you can also be taken out of the room by the interviewing officer

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Laloo Prasad said that he would do everything to prevent Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi from becoming the Prime Minister of the country
 lalune kaha, 'jab tak mere sharir main jaan he, maimodiko pradhanmantri nahin banane duungaa
 The former Bihar chief minister has sworn that after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he will unite secular forces and like-minded parties to form a secular government

 Laluane stressed that since Modico does not have the support of the whole of India, his dream of becoming Prime Minister can never be fulfilled

 Three people, including social worker Jean Dreze of Jharkhand, have been detained by the police from Garhwa district
 ye teenon apane bhojan ke adhikaar abhiyaan ke tahat gadwa ke bishunpura main jansabha karne gaye the
 Even before the program was started, the local police detained Jean Dreze, Vivek and one other
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki police ne inke mobile phone bhi jabt kar liye hai
 All three were kept in Bishunpura police station
 haalanki baad main police ne chhod diya
 Garhwa DC Harsh Mangla said that despite the administration not allowing any kind of meeting to be held by Jean Dreze and his associates, these people were meeting
 isliye unhen hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Supporters of Jean Dreze allege that the police are not allowing anyone to meet these three
 police yah bhi nahin bataa rahi he ki jyaan drej or unke saathiyon ko kyon hiraasat main liya gaya he
 JEAN DREJ had made a big disclosure in Jharkhand a few months ago
 It is worth mentioning that JAIN DREJ disclosed a few months ago the denial of benefits to beneficiaries in Jharkhand who have not linked Aadhaar pension, ration card, job card
 Was
 jharkhand main job card, rashan card yaa pensioner ko farji bataaya gaya he, or is mad main bachi hui raashi ko sarkaar aadhaar inable seaving kahkar khud kii vaahvahee lut rahi he
 Not only this, thousands of job cards have also been canceled due to not being linked with Aadhar card in Jharkhand
 jyaan drej ne khulaasa kiya tha ki 2017 main modi sarkaar ne kaha ki aadhaar kii vajah se 100 karod rupee bachaae, lekin artiai se praapt soochna se jaankaree mili kii jharkhand sarkaar jis tareeke se farji rashan card bataakar rashan card ko cancil kiye, usamen 12 fisadi hi galat the
 Due to this the needy had to be deprived of their right to ration
 kitaab: global gaanv ke devtalekhak:ranendraprakashak:bhartiya gyanpithkimat:70 rupeaj har koi vishwa ko gaanv banane kii baat kar rahaa he
 a Global Village
 lekin duniya ko gaanv banane kii daud main jo asal gaanv hai, ham unako gaanv banaae rakhane main naakaam sabit ho rahe hai
 Villages are becoming extinct and we talk of transforming the world into a global village
 ashiana banane kii khushi or uske tuutane kaa dar donon agar charam par hon, to jajbaat sabase zyada ufaan par hote hai
 In the blind race of development, everyone has set their own scale
 kisi badi company yaa sarkaar ke liye factriyaan or pakki imaarat bananaa vikaas he, lekin kisi ke liye yah vinaash kaa manjar he
 Human beings build their own small house, spend two moments of life in it with happiness
 lekin kai baar kuch logon ko duusare kii khushi kii keemat apni khushiyon kii qurbaani dekar chukaani padati he
 The happiness of tribals living in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal and other states of the country does not depend on the Twitter followers or the selfies posted on Facebook
 unki khushi adivasee ilaakon main unki basaai duniya main unki sharton par yaa buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa kar dene bhar se puri ho jaati he
 Through the book 'devta of Global Village', the writer Ranendra has taken a commendable step to keep the talk of the people who are very important and marginalized
 skool teacher kii naukari paa chuke ek maa ke ghunna kii posting shahar se dur pahaad ke upar jangal-khaadaanon ke bich bhunrapat main hoti he
 Bounarpat is an area where bauxite mining has been taking place continuously for years
 vikaas ke naam par qurbaani sirf garib tabake ko hi deni padati he
 Instead, he gets his own life
 swabhaavik he ki shuruyaat main navaniyukt teacher ko adivasee ilaaka boring laga, lekin vahaan ke halaat ko kitaab ke mukhya sutaradhar ke jariye pathakon ko samajhane kaa kaam lekhak ne bakhubi kiya he
 Asura: Regarding Asura, a caste of tribals, Ranendra has put forward the perception of common people in the book
 ranendra kitaab main likhte hai, ‚Äòasuron ke bare main meri dharna thi ki khub lambey-chaude, kaale-kaloote, bhayanak, daant-vaant nikle hue, maathe par sing-ving nikle hue log honge
 But knowing Lalchan, the 'character of the book', everything was going on and on
 bachapan kii sari kahaniyaan ulat rahi thim
 'the truth of the development of tribal areas: big companies in the race to make profits, do mining work in tribal villages fast
 aise gaanvon kii vyathaa ko bataate hue ranendra kitaab main likhaa he, ‚Äòpichley 25-30 saalon main khan-maalikon ne jo bade-bade gadde chode hai, barsaat main in gaddhon main pani bhar jaataa he or machhar palate hai
 The epidemic spreads
 log marate hai
 'companies in the tribal areas pit or displace the local people according to their needs, but when it comes time to compensate, companies like to remain silent for years
 ciyaani mahilaayein:adivasee gaanvon kii mahilaon ke bare main ranendra likhte hai, ‚Äòmahilaayein is samaaj main ciyaani kehalaati thim, janaani nahin
 The word Janani somewhere narrowed them down to the process of giving birth, while the word Siyani seemed to indicate their special sensibility
 ‚Äô iske baad bhi global gaanv ke devataaon ne apni jaruraton or ichhaapoorti ke liye in cianiyon kaa istemaal kiya
 The reason for the Siyani women to bow down to the gods was their compulsion
 andhvishwaas:andhvishwaas bharat kii jadon main failaa hua he
 The book also proves successful in exposing the superstitions spread in the society, there is an anecdote of superstition in the book, 'actually, it is still sitting in the minds of some people to throw the rice in the blood of the man and throw it away
 The crop is very good
 isliye is sijan main mudikatwa log ghoomte rahete hai
 'through the book, Ranendra has shown great need and grit on the expansion of Shivdas Baba who has come to the village edge and his special affection towards girls
 global gaanv ke devtaa kyon na padhebgar aapako gambhir vishay par likhi koi kitaab padhanaa acha nahin lagata, to ye kitaab aapke liye nahin he
 Since the book talks about tribal people moving away from metro cities
 aise main agar aap gambhir padhane ke aadi nahin hai to kitaab aapako bor kar sakati he
 In some parts of the book, local languages of tribal areas have been used
 aise main kuch bhaavon ko samajhane main mehnat kerani pad sakati he
 The book also fails to keep it tied at many places
 duusare shabdon main kahen to ye kitaab gambhir pathakon ke liye he
 Why should we read this book
 
 
 kitaab ek aise mudde ko 100 pannon main bayaan karti he, jise jaanane ke liye aapako kaaphi mashkkat kerani pad sakati he
 The book makes a serious depiction of the standards of development and the tribal problem in its beauty
 agar aap apni soch kaa dayera or desh kii badi aabaadi kaa dard or samasya ko samajhnaa chaahate hai to is kitaab main aapako puri eemaandaaree dekhne ko milegi
 One who loves to read critically, the gods of the global village of Ranendra will surely fulfill the wishes of such readers

 Every year, while studying there, he was taken to the countryside for a dental camp

 The right cancer makes easy drugs like betel nut and nuts
 isi dauraan unhone logon ko jaagruk karne kii jimmedaari uthaai
 The speed of the campaign slowed down due to UPSC and marriage
 
 
 doctor banane ke baad doctor ankitha upiessi kii taiyaari karne lageen
 During this time they also got married
 shaadi ke baad wo kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay ke liye kaam karne lageen
 She says that government employees used to bear the cost of their treatment, but what about those patients who are not financially prosperous
 aankadon ke aaine se jo tasviir vah dikhaati hai vah to or bhi bhayaavah he
 The city is full of doctors
 yahaan 15 hajaar logon main 1 dental sarjan maujuud he, jabaki gramin ilaakon main 1 lakh se zyada kii aabaadi par 1 dental sarjan hi uplabdh he
 In addition to going from village to village, she runs a free clinic

 For these players included in the Indian teams, it can also prove to be a great opportunity to practice in the series against Australia starting soon
 champions lig tii20 kii chaar main se teen tiimon mumbai indiens, rajasthan royles or chennai superkings ke captain (rohit sharma, rahul dravid, emes dhoni) bhartiya hai
 These superstar players are proof of Indian dominance in Champions League T20
 in sabake bich sachin tendulkar captain hon yaa na hon, kehane kii baat nahin ki champions lig main unki maujuudagi hi toornament main karodon phans kii dilchaspee ko barkaraar rakhegi
 For players like Rohit Sharma, the success of this tournament can prove to be important for the next season as well
 rohit ne mumbai ke liye perth scochars ke khilaaf 24 gendon par naabad 51 ran banaakar apni team ko semifinal main pahunchaa diya he
 Rohit Sharma has been in the form for the last two months, obviously captain MS Dhoni will definitely try to give him a big role in the upcoming matches
 andhra pradesh ke ambati raidu ne australia ke khilaaf team india ke pandrah khilaadiyon main apni jagah to pakki kar lee he, lekin agar unhen gyaarah main shaamil hona he to nokout round main apni ahmiyat sabit karne kaa acha mauka he

 Three of the four Champions League T20 teams Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings captain (rohit Sharma, Rahul Dravid, MS Dhoni) are Indians
 ye superstar khilaadi champions lig tii20 main bhartiya dabadabe kaa saboot hai
 Amidst all this, whether or not Sachin Tendulkar is the captain, it is not to say that his presence in the Champions League will keep the interest of crores of fans in the tournament

 The petition challenged the FCRA amendment
 tippaniyan Earlier the law did not allow foreign donations to political parties but amendments to the law exempted political parties and allowed them to receive foreign funds with retrospective effect

 The petitioner wants the amendment to be repealed
 isse pehle kanoon main raajnneetik dalon ko videshi daan kii anumati nahin di thi lekin kanoon main sanshodhan ne raajnneetik dalon ko chhot di or unhen purv-nirikshan prabhaav ke saath videshi fund praapt karne kii anumati di he
 Prashant Bhushan, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, argued that the amendment opened the doors for unlimited political donations from foreign companies and thus legalized the financial contributions received from foreign sources
 yachikakarta chahta he ki sanshodhan radd ho jaae

 To tell about 15 years of work in Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj government will resort to magicians so that power can be achieved for the fourth time
 chunaav prachaar main takat jhonkne baad bhi bijepi ko lag rahaa he ki public main utsaah nahin aa paa rahaa he
 Although it is natural to happen in the initial days, but the BJP wants to devise a way that gives information to the public and also entertains it
 yah kuch alag hoga lekin kya hoga, is par bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki yah rithik roshan ke 'koi mil gaya' jaisaa nahin hoga lekin kuch alag hoga
 The Madhya Pradesh BJP has confirmed that it has been decided to seek the help of magicians in the elections
 inke magic sho karaae jaaenge lekin unhen kya jimmedaari di jaae is par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Magician will tell how the BJP is different from the Congress: Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal told the news agency PTI that the magician will tell how much work the BJP government has done in 15 years and how it is different from the previous government of the Congress
 unhone spasht kiya ki prachaar ke liye party jaaduugaron ko bulaaegi
 According to reports, the party will organize a magic show in the markets so that it can be spread to more people
 isamen gramin or chote shahari ilaakon par focus kiya jayega
 After all, why with the help of magicians? Are political rallies and campaigns on social media not enough? Why do magicians and magic show? On this, the BJP spokesperson says that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is a big bet
 vah 15 saal se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 He is also facing anti-incumbency factor

 Subrata Roy's name is among the celebrities of the country who have mastered making money from money
 lekin mangalvaar ko supreme court main aate hi unki sari maharath bekaar chali gai
 Subrata Roy, who annoyed the Supreme Court in the case of liability of Rs 20 thousand crores and had the power to support others, then did not even have the support of law
 subrat roy 12 lakh pariwaron kaa sahaara he
 Show your wealth to everyone, be it a leader or an actor, who owes it
 khud ko desh kaa sabase bada desh bhakt sabit karnaa jiskaa sabase bada gurur he
 But he hardly ever thought about what happened in the Supreme Court premises with the same Subrata Roy
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ke daravaaje par pahunchate hi subrat roy sahaara kaa munh kaala ho gaya
 Perhaps the darkest day of his life was when ink was thrown on his face outside the court and his character inside the court
 gusse kii syahidesh kii sabase badi adaalat ke saamne pahunchane se pehle hi manoj sharma naam ke jis shaks ne subrat roy ke chehre par syaahi phenki uskaa kahana he ki roy garibon kaa chor he or vah choron ke khilaaf jang ladata he
 Dariusas is the soot of anger that fell directly on Subrata Roy Sahara's face rather than on her face
 ye gussa bharosa todane par tha, ye gussa jhooth bolne par tha or shaayad ye gussa kanoon se aankh micholi khilne kaa bhi tha
 Though Subrata Roy stepped forward wiping the ink from his face, but Manoj stopped in front of the camera
 subrat roy ke saath aae samarthakon ne syaahi phenkane vaale shaks kii jamkar dhunaai kii or uske kapade bhi faad die
 But now Subrata Roy, clean this black ink from your face no matter how much
 ye daag taumr unki haisiyat ko daagdar karata rahegaa
 The position is submerged by Subrata Roy in Chotalkhanu
 nawabon kii shaano shaukat vaale lakhanu kii shaan main jin chand mahalanuma makaanon kaa shumaar kiya jaataa he, unamem se ek ye bhi he
 But all are equal before the law
 subrat roy kii shaan us vakt dhili pad gai jab mangalvaar ko 2 baje court main kaarywahi shuru hui
 First, Subrata Roy unconditionally apologized to the court
 lekin apni shaan-shaukat kaa dambh bharne vaale subrat roy ko supreme court ke ultimatum ne sidhe tihaad pahunchaa diya he, jahaan unhen 11 march tak rahanaa he
 His release can be done even earlier, provided he tells the court the concrete plan of refund
 pichhali 28 farvari ko hi jab is kothi ke kivaadon ko kholkar kaaron kaa kafila court ke raste par niklaa tha to kisi ko andaja nahin tha ki ye safar ab dilli ke tihaad tak jari rahegaa
 In just four days, the world, doors and thresholds have all changed for Subrata Roy Sahara
 nahin kaam ai daleelcourt main subrat roy ke vakil ram jethmalani ne daleel di ki unki property kii keemat 28 hazaar karod rupee he
 If SEBI sells it, it will return the money
 is par court ne kaha ki sebi hi ye sab kyon kare
 This is your job, not someone else's
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki subrat roy chaahate to yahi kaam ab tak kar sakate the, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 The court further said, 'you continued to violate our order of August 2012
 hamane aapkaa bank account dekha he, usamen aapane hajaaron karod kaa tranjection dikhaaya he to usamen se nikaal kar de de
 On this, Subrata Roy's lawyer said that if they do not have such money in cash that they can give, then the court also said that you have given a lot of opportunity, but you did not care about it
 kam nahin hai subrat roy ke shauksubrat roy ko bachapan se hi film or cricket kaa shauk tha
 His hobby made him the 'sahara' of the Indian cricket team, while big film stars longed for him to get a 'sahara'
 alam ye tha ki unki ungali ke ek ishaare par bade se bada star bhi unke saamne hajiri bajaane laga
 Seeing it, Subrata Roy became the owner of such an empire, whose dream also seems like a dream to people
 tata, birla, ambani kaa kaarobaar ek taraf, sahaara kii shaan-o-shaukat ek taraf
 There is hardly such a film star, there is hardly any cricketer who has stayed away from the glow of Sahara
 
 
 
 Then Sahara's year was given to Amitabh
 amitabh bachchan kaa staradam dhalaan par tha
 His company was in the dock and the superstar of the century was the only one

 Amitabh never forgot that thing
 aise hi tamaam kisse hai jo subrat roy sahaara kii shakhsiyat ko bayaan karte hai

 It is said that he then switched the phone to the then Board President Jagmohan Dalmiya and offered 10 percent more money
 ye baat or he ki haal ke dinon main bisisiai se khatpat kii vajah se team india kii jersey se sahaara kaa logo hat gaya
 But through sports, Sahara became synonymous with a different kind of nationalism

 In the Sahara group, only two festivals are celebrated in a year and that too on 26 January and 15 August in the name of the Father of the Nation

 The speed of progress and the break of controversies, Roy's success was very fast and the faster he continued on the path of progress, the faster he got surrounded by questions
 subrat roy ne kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki bees saal pehle unki sahaara city par shuru hua vivaad unhen jail kii salaakhon tak pahunchaa degaa
 Subrata Roy, who reached the kingdom of Arabs with two thousand rupees, climbed the floor of success, then disputes with him also continued
 sahaara kaa vivaadon main ghirna or usase nipatakar baahar aane kaa chuuhe billi kaa khelchalata rahaa, lekin sebi ke saath ye khel unhen mahangaa pad gaya

 english gendbaajon kaa pradarshan stareey rahaa he or is kaaran unke lay main lautne kii ummid he
 Captain Cook has to keep in mind that the guarantee of the success of his bowlers in India is very low, because the pitches here are flat and helpful to the batsmen, so he should be more and more dependent on the performance of his batsmen

 Millions of Bollywood's Tiger Salman Khan's eyes will be on the sessions court of Jodhpur today, where Salman's bail plea is to be heard in a while
 haalanki salmaan ko jamaanat milane main khaas mushkil nahin honi chahie or isaki puri sambhaavnaaen hai ki unhen bel par aaj hi reeha kar diya jaae
 Salman has strong grounds to get a bail
 salmaan ke phens ke liye ham bataa rahe hai un kaarnon ke bare main, jiske chalate unhen bel milane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 1
 sabase ahm kaaran to yahi he ki beete 20 varshon ke dauraan court ne jab sunwaayee ke liye salmaan ko bulaayaa, vah khud court pahunche
 2
 duusari baat salmaan ne jaanch agenciyon ko bhi maamle kii jaanch main ab tak puraa sahyog diya he
 3
 teesraa ahm paksh salmaan ke bare main yah he ki unhone mumbai hit and ran cese se ulat is maamle main media main kisi tarah kii ool-julul bayaanbaji nahin kii or na hi court ke kisi faisle par sawaal uthaaya or na hi majaak udaaya4
 The acquittal of other Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre, who were accused along with Salman in the case, may also go in favor of Salman
 5
 Salman has already been acquitted in the charge under the Arms Act related to this case
 6
 Salman was acquitted of all charges by the High Court
 7
 On Thursday, the CJM court sentenced Salman, but no new witnesses or evidence in the case came before the court
 bataa den ki salmaan khan ke vakil anand desai ne bhi kal sijeem court ke faisle ko hairaani bharaa bataaya tha
 Salman's lawyer even goes so far as to say that it appears from the CJM court's decision that Salman Khan had gone out alone in the midnight to hunt in that remote area of jodhpur
 bataa den ki salmaan khan ko jodhpur kii CJM court ne 20 saal puraane kaale hiranon ke shikaar maamle main doshi qaraar dete hue 5 saal kii sajaa sunai he
 If the bail has not been received from the session court, then it will be the next step
 If Salman Khan does not get bail from the session court, then his lawyers can also go to the High Court or the Supreme Court
 haalanki aisi sthiti main salmaan ko jail se baahar aane ke liye kuch or dinon kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 The CJM court has given 60 days to file an appeal against its decision
 kanoon ke mutabik, agar salmaan ko 3 saal se kam kii sajaa hoti to sijeem court main hi jamaanat yachika daayar ho jaati
 But for a sentence of up to seven years, Bell has to appeal to the district judge's court
