 This is the Durex condom add, which is promoted by Bollywood star Ranveer Singh
 23 april din buudhvaar ko aid relies kiya gaya or kuch hi ghanton main ise you tub par hajaaron hits mil gaye
 The ad will soon go viral at this speed
 fasebuk par aisa hone bhi laga he
 This ad song from Ranveer is titled Lovers All Over the World, Let's Do the Rex
 iske liye rap khud ranvir ne kiya he
 In a country where sex is probably the most but apparently the most hidden thing, adding a condom from a big movie star is a bold move
 aisa karte hi ek khaas tarah ke labling kaa khatra to rahata hi he
 Now see, on our TV, day and night actors are seen selling men's under garments
 sab apane kool, hot hone kii baat kaa raaj bataate hai
 But will it be convenient for an actress to sell under garments? aisa to nahin ki aadhi aabaadi antarvastr pahenti nahin, kharidti nahin yaa unka vigyaapan nahin hota
 But these actresses do not do this because if they do, a superficial, shallow perception will be made towards them
 aap kah sakate hai ki ye beete jamaane kii baat he
 So i remember that scene from the movie Taal
 jisamen hero kaa parivaar heroin (aishwarya raay) ko nicha dikhaane ke liye ek kaam karata he
 The agency with whom Aishwarya has an agreement, it is said that we want to add bra to this model
 or is par ekaek nayak bhadak jaataa he
 It may be that the issue was more intentional than the product
 magar madhur bhandarkar kii film ‘fishan’ ek or sandarbh muhaiyaa karaati he
 Here too, the shampoo reached the heights of success, sometimes the model of some other selling model (priyanka Chopra) gets a big shock
 kyon, kyonki uske shuruaati dinon kii ve tasviren saamne aa jaati hai, jab vah ek under garments brand ke liye modelling karti thi
 Ranveer Brahahal, who will run the campaign for safe sex, Talking about this condom ad, Ranveer has given the same message with complete sorrow, mischief and bluster
 yuj condom
 Ranveer, who advocates for safe sex, says that in the last three and a half years, many types of ad proposals came
 main sabko na karata rahaa
 And then now if you go yes, then the result is in front of you
 ranvir sirf condom kaa aid nahin kar rahe, balki unka iraadaa logon ko sef sex ke bare main jaagruk karne kaa bhi he
 On the occasion of the ad release, he said that cases of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases are increasing in the country
 anachaahe garbh kii mushkil saamne aa rahi he
 In such a situation, i felt the need to advocate for a product
 vah condom hi he
 It is always in my pocket that Kondomato, what Ranvir advocates in the ad, he also does it himself
 kya vah hameshaa condom lekar chalate hai
 He answered this question with Chuhal
 haa
 always
 or meri sabhi purushon ko yahi salaah he
 Now it is interesting to see that in today's time when both the alleged alambardar of morality and the advocate of openness are present in plenty
 is aid or is vimarsh kaa kya hoga
 See Ranveer Singh dancing on rap song for condom's add let's do rex centre sarkaar ne aaj saaf kiya ki vah jabaran hindi ko pramot nahin kar rahi balki use anya kisi riginal bhashaa kii tarah pramot kar rahi he

 iesaiies ke sargana abu bakar al bagdadi kii maut ko lekar phir ek khabar ai he
 Syria's state television has claimed that Baghdadi was killed in a June 11 airstrike in the city of Raqqa, Syria
 vaise isse pehle ki duniya bagdadi kii maut par yakeen kare, ham aapako bataa den ki pichley do saal main bagdadi kii maut kii ye saatvin khabar he
 This means the seventh death of Baghdadi
 bagdadi par hamale kaa daawaek baar phir hua he bagdadi par ab tak ke sabase bade hamale kaa daawa
 The claim that the rains of white death occurred from the sky in Raqqa, its stronghold in Syria and the world's most feared terrorist and ISIS kingpin Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, killed in this rain
 ye safed maut vahi he jo aaj se kareeb dedh saal pehle roosi hawaii sena ne syria ke idaleeb shahar main barasaai thi
 When the sky shone with white light in the darkness of night and then the orange fire took the whole area in its wake
 jab ye sab ruka to ilaake main har chiz aag lagane kii vajah se jalakar khak ho chuki thi
 Now a similar attack has been claimed in the Syrian city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Baghdadi and ISIS
 syrian state televijan kii khabarsyria ke state televijan ne daawa kiya he ki rakka shahar main syria or koelation phujon kii safed phosforus bombing main iesas kaa mukhiya abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya he
 According to news reports in a major foreign newspaper and footage released on the Internet, the coalition forces launched massive attacks on terrorist targets in Raqqa, Syria
 footage main saafe zaahir he ki sena ne rakka ke ek khaas ilaake main maujuud building ko nishaanaa banaakar safed phosforus bam se hamalaa kiya
 It is believed that the area targeted was not only a stockpile of ISIS weapons but also the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi was also present
 phosforus hamale main maaraa gaya bagdadisyria ke state televijan kaa daawa he ki is phosforus hamale main duniya kaa ye sabase khoonkhaar aatanki maaraa gaya he
 However, no agency has yet confirmed this claim nor has there been any confirmation from ISIS
 lekin aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki internet par hamale se judi footage khud sanghathan se taalluk rakhane vaali news agency amaak ne jari kii hai
 At the same time, intelligence agencies have also claimed that it is true that the leader of the terrorist group Baghdadi has fled from Mosul towards his self-proclaimed capital Raqqa in Syria
 isi daawey kii vajah se syrian sena ke adhikari soshal media par bagdadi kii maut kii pushti karne se peeche nahin hat rahe hai
 The death of the successor also: The news of the death of Baghdadi comes at a time when his successor, Ayad al-jumali, is said to have been killed in airstrikes on the syrian-iraq border
 jumali iesas kaa doosraa sabase bada netaa or yuddh mantri tha
 Although no major agency has confirmed the death of Baghdadi, but apart from Syrian State Television, many other media institutions including Syrian Activist, Raqqa 24 are confirming this news
 haalanki britain sthit sirian obzarvetry for human rhite ne mana he ki gathbandhan senaaon ne rakka par hawaii hamale kiye hai, jisamen 13 nagarikon ke maare jane kii khabar he
 This is not the first time Baghdadi's death is being claimed
 bagdadi par 25 million dollar kaa inaamisase pehle bhi kai baar aise daawey kiye jate rahe hai magar har baar 25 million dollar kaa ye inami khoonkhaar aatanki mar kar bhi zindaa ho jaataa he
 Many agencies are agreeing to the coalition army attack in Raqqa city
 is hamale main kai logon ke maare jane kii bhi pushti kar rahi hai
 But the rest of the country, including the US, are avoiding any claim at all about the death of Baghdadi
 isaki ek vajah ye bhi he ki ye syrian sena kaa propeganda bhi ho saktaa he taaki sena kaa hausala badhaayaa ja sake or bagdadi kii maut kii pushti na karne kii duusari vajah ye bhi he ki isse pehle bhi chah baar uski maut kii khabar aa chuki he
 Doubtful of Baghdadi's death, the news of Baghdadi's death on Syrian State Television is sure to be reassuring, but it cannot be easily believed that this news is correct
 uski vajah ye he ki isse pehle bhi kareeb 7 aise maukey aa chuke hai ki jab duniya ne bagdadi kii maut kii khabaren suni
 But each time those news proved to be wrong
 media main khabaren ain ki syrian seemaa se lagane vaale iraq ke ninevah praant ke al-baj shahar main gathbandhan senaaon ke hawaii hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya
 It was told that this attack happened when Baghdadi was having a meeting with his special people about who would be his Nayab
 haalanki ek maheene baad 22 april ko phir khabar ai ki bagdadi maaraa nahin gaya balki spinal injuri hone kii vajah se uskaa jism paralised ho gaya he
 America denied the news, although the US refused to accept these news as true
 18 march ko hue hamale ke daavon ko hi aage badhaate hue da neuyork times ne likhaa ki hawaii hamale main zakhmi hua bagdadi maaraa gaya
 According to news from The Guardian in the month of May, ISIS militants vowed to avenge the attack on Baghdadi and threatened to attack Europe
 isse kam se ye to tay hua ki bagdadi par hamalaa hua
 But even this could not be confirmed till date
 iraqi sena ne daawa kiya ki syrian seemaa ke nazadik anbar praant main bagdadi ke kafile par hawaii hamale kiye gaye, jisamen wo maaraa gaya
 It was told that he was going to attend a meeting of terror in the outskirts of Karbala, near Baghdad
 pehle bhi aa chuki hai maut kii khabarenhaalanki baad main bagdadi kii maut kii khabaron ko ye kahkar nakaar diya gaya ki wo is kafile main maujuud hi nahin tha
 In June 2016, nearly 9 months after the last death claim, Iraqi State TV once again claimed that Baghdadi was killed in a US airstrike in northern Iraq
 magar baad main khabar ai ki wo in hamalon main sirf ghayal hua
 However, the coalition forces did not confirm this
 mahaz 3 din baad phir middle east ke kai media sansthaanon ne ye daawa kiya ki bagdadi kii maut ho gai
 It is reported that Baghdadi died in an American air strike in Raqqa
 haalanki baad main ek akhbaar ne in khabaron ko nakaarte hue kaha ki ye khabaren internet par prasaarit ek galat tasviir kii vajah se saamne ain
 The betel nut killer has also been killed
 The Baghdadi Kokhud coalition forces refused to accept the news of the death
 is baar wo khabar ai jisapar logon ko thodi ummid jaagi
 The news was that a betrothed killer has poisoned and killed 3 major ISIS terrorist leaders, including Baghdadi
 kai tivi channelon ne is baat kaa daawa bhi kiya
 But this news also turned out to be false and now Syrian State Television has claimed Baghdadi killed in the white phosphorus attack of coalition forces
 ab ye daawa kitna sahi he, ye tabhi tay ho saktaa he ki jab koi jaanch agency is baat pushti kare
 At present, this claim is also being seen from the point of view
 syrian state television kaa daawa he ki phosforus hamale main bagdadi maaraa gaya
 It is being said that it is difficult to avoid Phosphorus attack, if Baghdadi has come in the name of Phosphorus attack, then it is impossible to escape
 saal 2015 main duniya dekh chuki he ki ye safed atake kitna ghaatak hota he
 Let us tell you that earlier in Syria, in November 2015, in the year 2015, Russian army launched a similar air attack on the city of Idlib, in which the whole area was burnt down
 aatank ke khatme ke liye rus kya kar saktaa he
 The world saw its picture on 13 November 2015, when the rainy death took place in the presence of the city of Idlib, Syria, which was the base of terrorists and rebels
 raat ke andhere main achaanak aasmaan main aatishbaazi hone lagi
 Phosphorus gas throttles the bones as if hundreds of rockets are simultaneously falling from the sky towards the ground, but then as soon as these rockets hit the village land, suddenly a sheet of white smoke suddenly engulfs the whole area
 is
 ye safed dhuen kii chadar kuch or nahin balki wo zahreeli safed phosforus gas he, jo insaanon ke jism ke saath-saath uski haddiyaan tak galaa detii he
 The person who made the video of this sky's death in Russia was very scared himself

 She later posted this video on a Twitter account

 Hundreds of people seriously injured Hundreds of people were seriously injured in this attack
 darasal is shahar par ieaies ke aatankiyon kaa kabza tha or isi vajah se rus ne in ilaakon par hamalaa kiya tha
 But later there were reports that there were no Syrian civilians but IS terrorists here

 By the way, let us tell you that white phosphorus is also called WP and the army of any country uses it at night to light their enemy bases

 The heart, liver and kidney can be completely damaged by any person who is vulnerable
 jaan bhi le sakati he phosforus gaedgar koi shaks zyaada der tak phosforus gas kii chapet main aa jaae to uski maut bhi ho sakati he
 It is also a fact that the Russian army was bombing their targets by targeting IS militants as well as Assad opponents
 lekin agar vaaki ye tasviren sach hai to phir rus ke liye antarrashtriya str par dikkatein paidaa ho sakati hai, kyonki geneva canavension ke mutabik, kisi bhi desh kii sena duusare desh ke nagarikon par phosforus yaa koi or rasinic bam kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati
 If Russia is behind this attack, then its army has violated the Geneva Convention
 lekin abhi tak is baat kii tasdik nahin ho pai he ki is hamale ke peeche roosi sena kaa hi haath tha

 Threatening a different Prime Minister
 ' The Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday had a heated debate between a bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary and the Attorney General and lawyers and the situation deteriorated so much that the security forces had to be called
 choudhary kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne jaise hi pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ko nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kaa doshi maanane ke baavjood neshnal essembly kii adhyaksh dwaara unhen ayogy ghoshit nahin kiye jane ke khilaaf daayar yachikaaon kii sunwaayi shuru kii, tikhi bahes shuru ho gai
 During the hearing, Attorney General Irfan Qadir expressed disbelief in a three-judge bench and said that the Chief Justice should not hear the case
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne jab ek yachikakarta ke vakil se poocha ki use apana paksh rakhane ke liye kitna samay chahie, to kaadir ne sawaal kiya ki vah maamle kii sunwaayi ke liye itani jaldi main kyon hai
 The Attorney General attempted to cut the Chief Justice's point several times
 iske baad peeth ne unase abhadra vyavhaar nahin karne ko kaha
 Hearing bitter arguments, a group of lawyers entered the court and started criticizing the Attorney General
 kaadir or vakeelon main tikhi bahes hui
 Qadir repeatedly said that Judge Gilani, who was hearing the case against the Prime Minister, had "escaped" from the court after he was sentenced
 atorni general ne lagaataar ‘ashleel bhangimaayein’ banaayi jisase kuch vakil krodhit ho gaye
 Later security forces had to be summoned to take control of the situation
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne pratikriya dete hue kaha ki nyaayalay main bolne kaa sabhi ko adhikaar he lekin nyaayalay kii garima ko banaae rakhana chahie
 The Prime Minister's lawyer Etjaz Ahsan sought time to present his case, after which the court adjourned the hearing of the case till tomorrow
 supreme court, pradhanmantri gilaani ko nyaayalay kii avmaananaa kaa doshi qaraar die jane ke baad unhen ayogy ghoshit karne kii prakriya kii shuruuaat karne se manaa karne ke neshnal essembly kii adhyaksh fahmida mirza ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon kii sunwaayi kar rahaa tha
 In April this year, the Supreme Court sentenced Gilani to a one-minute symbolic sentence for contempt of court against President Asif Ali Zardari for refusing to initiate a corruption case in Switzerland
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had issued notices to Prime Minister Gilani, Attorney General, Chairman, Election Commission and the government seeking response to the petitions challenging the Speaker's decision
 yah yachikaayen piemail-en, pakistan taharik-e-insaaf or vakil ajahar choudhary samet anya logon ne daayar kii hai
 On the other hand, the National Assembly and the lower house of the country today passed a resolution in support of the Speaker's decision not to disqualify the Prime Minister
 prastaav ko patal par sattarudh dal pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke varisht netaa or kanoon mantri farukh nike ne rakhaa
 a heated debate began as soon as the bench headed by Chaudhary began hearing the petitions filed against the disqualification by the President of the National Assembly despite Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani being found guilty of contempt of court
 sunwaayi ke dauraan atorni general irfan kaadir ne teen nyayadhishon vaali peeth main avishvaas jataayaa or kaha ki pradhan nyaayadhish ko maamle kii sunwaayi nahin kerani chahie
 When the Chief Justice asked the counsel for one of the petitioners how much time he needed to present his case, Qadir questioned why he was in such a hurry to hear the case
 atorni general ne pradhan nyaayadhish kii baat ko kai baar kaatane kaa prayaas kiya
 After this, the bench asked them not to behave indecently
 tikhi bahes sunakar vakeelon kaa ek samooh nyaayalay main bheetar aa gaya or unhone atorni general kii aalochana kerani shuru kar di
 There was a fierce debate between Qadir and the lawyers
 kaadir ne baar-baar kaha ki pradhanmantri ke khilaaf maamle kii sunwaayi kar rahe nyaayadhish gilaani ko sajaa sunaane ke baad adaalat se ‘‘bhaag gaye’’ the
 The Attorney General continuously made 'obscene gestures' which angered some lawyers

 The Chief Justice reacted saying that everyone has the right to speak in the court but the dignity of the court should be maintained

 We want Ali and Bajrang Bali too but don't want Anarkali
 ' haalanki, abdulla ne jayaprada kaa naam nahin liya

 The message for the polluters is - you have not left my edges
 rishikesh kaa swaminarayan ashram kaa bhi aadhe se adhik hissaa ganga kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 When the Ganga's water level started rising after noon on Monday, this ashram saw the devastation of floods

 Currently Dhoni charges 8 to 12 crores annually for endorsement of any products
 kam ho sakati he dhoni kii kamaidhonine ranchi jaise chote shahar se uthakar aasmaan kii oonchaaiyon ko chuaa
 During his cricket career, he overcame many difficulties and reached the summit

 Also, Pawar, who is completing his four and a half decades in politics, has announced his retirement saying that he will not contest the next Lok Sabha election

 Pawar said in a conversation with a private channel, 'the Congress party has introduced him (to Rahul Gandhi)
 vah pramukh prachaarak hai naa ki digvijay singh yaa koi anya netaa
 The Congress party will say anything but if they do not perform well then the public and election analysts will certainly hold them responsible
 ’ congress ne pavaar ke bayaan ko kamatar aankane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said that it is absolutely unfair to give credit or hold anyone responsible
 jab pavaar se poocha gaya ki kya rahul gandhi ko vidhansabha chunaav ke tatkaal baad agle pradhanmantri ke taur par pesh kiya jayega to unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki achche nateezon ke baad bhi congress unhen tatkaal pesh karegi
 They can also wait for the next elections
 ’ ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘aaj kii sthiti main mujhe rashtriya netritv main mul taur par pradhanmantri pad main badlaav kii koi sambhaavna nahin dikhaai detii
 The NCP president said that in Uttar Pradesh, SP is more likely to get support from other parties after the elections
 yadi ve sarkaar banane main safal hote hai to yah congress kaa manobal badhaane vaali baat hogi
 Things will improve in terms of the upa's stability
 pavaar ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin pataa ki mayawati ko koun samarthan degaa
 If Mayawati's party emerges as the largest party, then only BJP can support it because Mulayam Singh's party will not support them
 ajit singh or anya se samarthan milane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 However, Nitin Gadkari had said somewhere that the BJP would not support Mayawati to form the government
 ’ unhone kaha ki paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav samprag kii sthirataa ke lihaaj se bahut ahmiyat nahin rakhte
 Describing Uttar Pradesh and Punjab as the most important of the five contested states, he said that it seems that the Congress will come to power in Punjab, which will be of great benefit to the Union
 rahul ke sandarbh main unhone kaha, ‘hamen ek cheez manani hogi ki vah kisi bhi anya vyakti kii tarah daure kar rahe hai
 Many are addressing public meetings
 yadi congress kii haalat main sudhaar hota he to nishchit rup se shrey unhen jayega
 It also seems that the Congress has taken a conscious decision to present him as a star campaigner
 ’chunavi raajnneeti ke sandarbh main pavaar ne kaha ki unhone kaaphi kuch dekh liya he chunki 1967 se lagaataar chune jate rahe hai
 He said, 'it is the responsibility of people like me to encourage the youth and the youth leadership will work continuously
 ’ kya pavaar bhavishya main kisi ko rakanpa kaa netaa pesh karne ke bare main soch rahe hai, is bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘main kisi ko pesh karne main bharosa nahin karata
 This is a kind of feudal thinking
 maan lijie ki koi kisi rajya kaa raja he to agali peedi aegi or satta sanbhaalegi, yah alag baat he
 This is democracy

 scindia ke saath gaye saare log 25 may ko hi laut aae
 But the Home Minister remained there
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki scindia 30 may ko waapas aaenge
 But the question is whether Shinde should not come back after the Naxalite attack

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a visit to Chennai about 8 months ago
 tab superstar rajnikant se unki mulaakaat ne surkhiyaan batori thim or tamaam siyaasi gathjod kii atakalon ko hawa mili thi
 Now Talaiva has announced to follow the political path
 netaa rajnikant siyaasi ection main hai or raajnneeti hi nahin filmi style main system badalane kaa bhi elaan kar rahe hai
 It is believed that Rajinikanth can change the political tone and caller of Tamil Nadu from his entry in politics
 rajnikant modi kii tarif karte rahe hai or pro-modi maane jate hai, unke raajnneeti main aane ke faisle se bijepi ko dakshin bharat main ummid kii kiran jaagi he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the mission of PM Modi for Tamil Nadu has not come as Rajinikanth Sanjeevani
 tamilnadu kii siyasat main uthal-puthalraajnneeti main aane ke naam par rajnikant do dashakon se haa naa karte karte saal ke aakhri siyaasi ran main utarane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Rajinikanth has entered the state of Tamil Nadu at a time when there is a vacuum in the state's politics since Jayalalithaa's death
 jayalalita kii viraasat ko lekar party main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Sasikala, who claims his succession, is in jail
 aise samay main rajnikant ne siyasat main kadam rakhaa he
 He claimed that he would soon form his own party and contest all the assembly seats
 tamilnadu kii siyasat par bijepi kii najararajya kii siyasat main bijepi kaa koi khaas janaadhar nahin he
 Despite this, the BJP has not given up hope in the state
 rajnikant ne apni raajnneeti kis disha main le jaaenge, ye saaf nahin he
 But the BJP hopes that Rajinikanth will do politics in the traditional way of the state
 tamilnadu kii dravid siyasat main alag rajnikant aadhyatmik raajnneeti karenge, jo bijepi ke bhagava raajnneeti kii tarj par hogi
 Rajinikanth is a man of spiritual nature
 dravid samskruti ke baavjood tamilnadu main aadhyatmikta kii ek majboot zamin rahi he jise bijepi kabhi dohan nahin kar pai
 In such a situation, it is believed that Rajinikanth can strengthen political ground by using it in his favor
 pro-modi rajnikant kii siyaasi intrirajnikant pro-modi maane jate hai
 He never spoke a single word against Modi
 dayanand saraswati jaise aadhyatmik netaaon ne kai saal pehle rajnikant se bijepi ke saath judakar kaam karne ke liye kaha tha
 Apart from this, he has met many times from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 lekin superstar hameshaa bijepi ko khule taur par jane-pahachaane jane ke saath apane raajnneetik sambandh banane se kataraate rahe hai
 For AIADMK, Sanketrajnikanth, Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa have an equal face
 unke siyasat main kadam rakhane se sidhaa asar padegaa jiskaa nuksaan sattashin AIADMK party ko ho saktaa he
 Not only this, it will not only have an impact in the assembly elections, but it will also have an impact in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 rajnikant agar alag party banaakar bhi chunaav ladate bhi hai to iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko milegaa
 In the politics of Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK has no leader after Jayalalithaa and in the DMK who can win elections on her own
 opies, ipies or dinakaran jaise netaaon kaa dayera simit hai
 The DMK is in the hands of Stalin, the last two elections were fought under his leadership but could not win the party
 aise main rajnikant ke superstar vaali chhavi kaa phayda unki party ko milegaa
 However, right now the political picture of Rajinikanth is not very clear how he will proceed and on whose support he will move forward

 matdaan ke tatkaal baad alpesh thakor or jaala ne congress ke vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha
 The Congress asked the Election Commission to cancel the votes of Alpesh and Jala as they have voted against the party's candidate in defiance of the whip
 lekin matganana shuru hone ke pehle nirvachan ayog ne unki arji khaarij kar di
 Since the voting for the two seats have been separated, each candidate needs 50 percent of the votes to win
 jaishankar ne apni jeet ke liye bhaajapa ke kendriya or rajya netritv kaa shukriya adaa kiya he
 He said that the Ministry of External Affairs has special relations with the people of Gujarat as people of this state have settled in large numbers abroad

 State BJP chief Jitu Vaghani said that upa's allies and Congress have also voted for BJP

 In his blog, Union Minister Arun Jaitley has attributed Article 35-A to the current circumstances of Kashmir

 He targeted India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the blog and said that Nehru's attitude towards Jammu and Kashmir was not right
 ab samay aa gaya he ki ham vishesh darje se algaav tak kii yatra ko viraam den
 Arun Jaitley said that in 1954 'article 35A was added to the Constitution by stealth
 isse rajya main nivesh or rojgaar srijan ruk gaya or iskaa khamiyaja rajya kii janata ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that Article 35-A was not brought through any constitutional amendment
 35 e do nagarikon main bhedbhaav kii anumati detaa he
 Citizens outside the state cannot buy property there
 unke bacchon ko collejon main daakhila nahin mil saktaa
 They cannot get government jobs
 or jo vahaan assembly ke, municipelity ke or panchayat ke chunaav main vot bhi nahin daal sakate
 The effect of this was that there was no economic resource from outside
 koi nae college nahin bane, koi privet uniwarsity nahin baniin
 Industries did not take off
 koi udyog nahin lage
 No such hotel change took place in such a big tourist center
 isaki vajah se arthvyavastha bhi sikudi rahi
 And because of this, the new jobs, job creations that had to be done, did not happen inside the state
 iskaa sabase bada nuksaan jo hua rajya kii janata ko hua
 While the economic resources within the state are very less

 Was Nehru's policy the biggest mistake in history or was it the right step to follow

 But this time his wife will be with him as a companion in this campaign
 ashutosh ne bataaya ki pehali baar jab ham yatra par nikle the to kuch doston or rajya kii sthaneey sansthaaon ne hamaara sahyog kiya tha
 Many times it happened that we reached a state and we had no money left to spend

 Ashutosh Kumar says, within two days, 12 people from different corners of the country transferred money to the account
 apil ek ru
 At least there was an appeal of cooperation
 lekin kisi ne ek sau ek ru
 So someone gave two hundred, two and a half hundred, five hundred rupees
 tak acount main jamaa kiye hai
 About Rs 3000 in two days
 ikatthe ho chuke hai
 Some of the people are also collaborating personally including the Prime Minister of India Janaushadhi Project, Brain Behavior Research Foundation of India, University of Mewar, Spandan, Hindusthan Samachar, Social Reforms and Research Organization
 *** Bigg Boss 13 is very much liked by the audience

 On Saturday and Sunday of every week, Salman Khan comes with a weekend war
 weekend kaa waar main salmaan khan ghar waalon kii class lete hai or unhen nae-nae task dete hai
 Apart from this, Eliminesh's alert is most special with the arrival of Salman Khan
 har hafte salmaan khan ek aise contestant kaa naam ghoshit karte hai jo big bos ke ghar se beghar hota he
 This week two families were to be homeless as no one had moved out in the first week
 shanivaar ko dalajit cor big bos ke ghar se baahar ain or ravivaar ko bhi kisi ek gharavaale ko baahar aana tha

 Shehnaz also apologized to Koena
 koena ne ghar se beghar hote samay rashmi ko alavida nahin kaha
 Rashmi also discussed this and said that Koena Mitra is angry with her so did not meet her while going out
 koena mitra ke game ko logon ne khub pasand kiya he
 His fans are very upset with Koena coming out of the house on Twitter
 koena ke phens kaa kahana he ki vah ghar main peeth peeche chugali nahin karti thim
 People on Twitter said that Salman Khan was forcefully denying Koena Mitra as she speaks the truth on everyone's face

 As soon as Salman Khan announces Daljeet's name, she stands in her place and starts saying goodbye to all the people

 However, people are surprised to see Daljit Kaur coming out of the show
 soshal media yugers kaa kahana he ki dalajit ek acchhee chhavi kii contestant hai jo fere game khel rahi thim
 Fans believe that Daljit's exit from Bigg Boss house is very unfit
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki dalajit kii jagah shahanaz cor ko ghar se beghar hona chahie tha
 At the same time, some people say that Koyna could also be evacuated from the house instead of Daljati

 iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne ravivaar ko america ko chetate hue kaha ki america tehran or vishwa kii takaton ke bich hue parmaanu samjhaute ko america todta he to washington ko baad main pachhataanaa padegaa
 US President Donald Trump has warned that on May 12, he will not pursue the agreement
 america raashtrapati trump ne maang kii he ki america ke europea sahyogi khaamiyon ko dur karen nahin to vah phir se pabandi lagaayenge
 In his televised address in northwest Iran, President Rouhani said, "if America leaves the nuclear deal, you will soon see that they will regret it like it never did in history
" ’ruhani ne kaha, ‘trump ko jaananaa chahie ki hamaare log ekajute hai, yahudee shashan (israel) ko yah jarur jaananaa chahie ki hamaare log ekajute hai
 a nuclear deal was signed between the US, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran in 2015, led by former US President Barack Obama
 isroyal ne kii bharat se batairan parmaanu samjhaute par antarrashtriya samarthan jutaney ke makasad se isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ne apane bhartiya samakaksh narendra modi ko haalia ghatnakram kii jaankaree di
 a statement issued by Netanyahu's media adviser said that the Israeli Prime Minister has spoken to three important international leaders, Modi, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and British Prime Minister Terija May
 media salaahkaar kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki netanyahu ne vishwa netaaon ke sathkshetreey muddon par charchaaki or unhen jaankaree di ki unhone iran ke parmaanu sangrah ke sambandh main mahatvapurn saamagree kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Netanyahu previously told the media that he would share more than 100,000 documents
 bharat ke sabase pracheen wanon ko sangrakshit rakhane vaali odisha kii niyamagiri parvat shrunkhlaa ab jang kaa maidan ban chuki he
 On one hand, there are advocates for increasing the revenue and employment of the state by exploiting the natural wealth in this mountain range located in Kalahandi and Rayagada districts of Odisha and on the other hand Dongria Kaund are tribals whose survival is dependent on Niyamgiri
 unke liye yah parvat hi unka sab kuch he
 The tribals feel that mining will damage their area
 dongariyaa kaundh jati ke in adivaasiyon ke kade virodh ke chalate hi supreme court ne teen saal pehle niyamagiri pahaad se khanan kar boxite nikaalane par pabandi laga di thi
 But Odisha Mines Corporation Limited (OMCL) has now filed a review petition in the Supreme Court
 is yachika main adaalat se maang kii gai he ki vah gram sabhaaon main ek baar phir se jansunwaayee karaane kaa aadesh de or khanan ke kaam main sthaneey logon kii bhagidaari sunishchit kare
 It is said that private mining company Vedanta is particularly interested in Niyamgiri mining as it will run the aluminum refinery of its subsidiary Sterlite based in Lanjigarh block and it will start making raw materials easily available
 haalanki nae niyamon ke mutabik, malikana haq to oemasiel kaa hi rahegaa lekin adhiktam tees fisadi share nijee kshetra ko die ja sakate hai
 Not only this, OMCL has told the Ministry of Forests that it will do mining alone
 yahi nahin, pichley saal odisha sarkaar ne vedanta ke saath saajha upkram bhi radd kar diya
 Vedanta and Sterlite are Anil Aggarwal's companies
 sterlite ne 2001 main chhattisgarh ke korba sthit saarvajanik kshetra kii munafa kamaane vaali bharat aluminium company (baalko) ko kharid liya tha
 It was the first public sector profit making company to be disinvested
 is nirnay kaa sthaneey logon ne baari virodh kiya tha
 But the then NDA government at the Center had disinvested Balco despite opposition from the Congress government of Chhattisgarh
 kalahandi ke lanjigarh prakhand main jo aluminium rifinary he, vah bhi isi company kii he
 However, a senior Vedanta official says, "now our company has no agreement with OMCL
 yachika oemasiel ne daayar kii he or puri tasviir main ham nahin hai
 As such, the shareholding of private companies is nominal under the new rules, in which case the ownership of private companies will not remain
 ''sthaneey adivaasiyon ke virodh ke kaaran vedanta or oemasiel kii boxite khanan kii saajha pariyojna ko teen saal pehle jhatka laga tha
 The 12 parli sabhas (gram panchayats) settled on the Niyamgiri chosen by the state government on the order of the Supreme Court were said to be in favor or opposition of the project through public hearing between July and August 2013 in the presence of the district judge
 Decide which will be implemented
 sabhi palli sabhaayen niyamagiri utkhanan pariyojna ke virodh main thim
 As a result, excavation work could not proceed
 ab teen saal baad kaaphi soch-vichaar kar oemasiel ne punarvichaar yachika daayar kii he
 The dispute began in 1997 when a joint venture was agreed between OMCL and Vedanta Aluminum Limited
 iske antargat niyamagiri or khambasi paharipoon ko khodakar boxite nikaalane kaa kaam kiya janaa tha
 "this is probably the first time in the history of independent India, when the tribals got such a big success in the fight for their existence," says Lingaraj Azad, secretary of the Samajwadi Jan Parishad, the leader of the Niyamgiri tribal fight
 is jansunwaayee main kalahandi kii saat or raigadha kii paanch palli sabhaayen shaamil hui thim
 Dongria Kaund is one of the rare tribes considered the most primitive
 inaki aabaadi ab takreeban 10,000 rah gai he
 Away from the mainstream of development, this tribe is located on Niyamgiri Hills in the areas of Kalahandi and Rayagada in Odisha
 apane astitv ke liye wanon par puri tarah nirbhar is janajati ke liye niyamagiri hi sab kuch he, jeene ke sansaadhan se lekar unke saanskrithik anushthan or moksh kii prarthana tak
 The tribal community considers Niyamgiri as their god and king here
 lekin in bhole-bhaale adivaasiyon ko yah nahin pataa ki ki jis niyamagiri parvat ne unhen aashray diya he, uske neeche karodon ton boxite dabaa padaa he, jiskaa unke liye bhale koi mol na ho, lekin sarkari or nijee kshetra kii companiyon ko uski keemat pataa he
 The state-owned company OMCL was also eyeing this mineral
 isliye oemasiel ne 25 farvari ko punarvichaar yachika daayar kar di
 In fact in Niyamgiri, the decision that was taken keeping in mind the interests of the tribals was no less than a revolution
 ise van adhikaar adhinium, 2006 kii badi safalataa kaha ja saktaa he, jisane adivaasiyon or anya vanavaasiyon ke adhikaar surakshit kiye hai
 This is the first decision made on the basis of this law brought in lieu of forest law at the time of Firangi rule, which has protected the livelihood of forest and tribals
 green kalahandi naam kii sanstha ke adhyaksh siddharth nayak kehete hai, ''oemasi kii punarvichaar yachika kaa virodh kiya jayega
 Bauxite mining will not be allowed at any cost by desolating the tribals
 vikaas ekatarfa or manamaane tareeke se nahin ho saktaa
 "an important question also arises that when precious mineral materials like bauxite and iron are buried in the earth, why should they not be exploited?"

 After taking the loan from the bank, the company is no longer in a position to repay the loan, so the Economic Offenses Wing investigating the case of default has taken this step
 emdi or siio ke alaava bank of maharashtra ke kaaryakari nideshak aarake gupta or bank ke purv siemdi susheel muhanot ko bhi hiraasat main le liya gaya he

 is aarope ke baad mukhyamantri ko bikri rokani padi or ek nyaayik jaanch kaa aadesh dena padaa jisamen 2009 ke baad se 200 jameen saudon kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 It seems that Fadnavis is being kept in the dark on some fronts
 june main jab police ne pune main bank of maharashtra ke chairman rabindra marathe ko giraftaar kiya to mukhyamantri (jo grih mantri bhi hai) yaa rigerv bank ko suchit karnaa jaruri nahin samajha gaya
 Later, Fadnavis said, "I am concerned about the way the police acted in this case
" '' ab yah koi chuphi baat nahin he ki police or naukarshahi mukhyamantri or mantriyon kii baat nahin sunati
 Recently, Social Justice Minister Rajkumar Badole publicly stated that his secretary had defied his instructions

 anoushka sharma kii film 'filori' ke pehle tiger se hi logon main ise lekar kaaphi utsaah he
 Bollywood's big stars praised Anushka's trailer for the film, which made Anushka very happy, but a news related to this film has upset Anushka
 darasal is film ke pehle trailor ke kuch din baat hi khabaren ai ki anoushka sharma kii is film main unke boyfriend or cricketer viraat kohli ne paisa lagaaya he
 Although Anushka Sharma has denied this news, but Anushka is not disturbed by the coming of such news but she is quite surprised by it
 yah kahana he is film ke diarector anshai laal kaa jinhone news agency pitiai ko die ek intervyuu main yah baat kahi
 The comments anshai ne pitiai ko bataaya, ' mujhe nahin lagata ki vah isse pareshaan he
 i think he is very surprised how such stories come out
 unhen jo kahana tha vah kah chuki hai or ham unke saath hai
 It is lousy and irresponsible that such news comes out
 ' However, when he tried to know if Virat came on the set of the film 'phillauri', Anshai refused to say anything on the subject
 bataa den ki farvari kii shuruyaat main kuch aisi khabaren ai thim anoushka sharma kii is film kaa production darasal viraat kohli kar rahe hai or anoushka ne is baat kaa khandan karte hue likh, ' is tarah kii juthi or bina tathyon par aadhaarit khabaron ko sorce ke hawaale se chhap kar aap logon na keval meri mahanat kaa apmaan kiya he jisaki badolat main yahaan hum, balki un sab kaa bhi apmaan kiya he jo is film main kaam kar rahe hai

 isse pehle vah saal 2015 main film 'enech 10' kaa production kar chuki hai
 Anshai told PTI, 'I don't think she is upset by it

 Putting to rest some rumours that have been doing the rounds for some days now (1 / 2)A post shared by anushkasharma1588 (@anushkasharma) on Feb 10, 2017 at 6:53am PST The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has issued advisories to TV channels, which prohibit telecasting condom advertisements during the day
 adwijuri main smriti irani ke netritv vaale soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne kaha he ki condom ke vigyaapan keval raat 10 baje se subah 6 baje tak hi dikhaae jaaen
 Strict adherence to the provisions contained in the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 to prevent such content from reaching children
 mantralayadvara jari adwijuri main likhaa gaya he, soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke sangyaan main laayaa gaya he ki kuch channel kai baar condom kaa vigyaapan chalaate hai, jo bacchon ke liye thik nahin he
 In this regard, TV channels should pay attention to the Cable Television Network Rule, 1994, under which Rule 7 (7) does not run advertisements which affect the safety of children or affect them unfairly
 vahiin niyam 7 (8) kahata he ki vigyapanon main anuchit, ashleel, daraavna yaa apmanjanak vishay yaa varnan nahin hona chahie
 Keeping all these things in mind, it is suggested to all TV channels not to telecast such condom advertising which is designed for a particular age group and is inappropriate for children
 aise vigyaapan raat 10 baje se subah 6 baje tak hi dikhaae jane chahie
 This government advisory came when the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) earlier this month demanded the ministry to take action regarding such advertisements and their time

 Along with this, filling all GST returns is also necessary for all traders
 adivasee bahul chhattisgarh main nau saal se mukhyamantri kii kursi par kabiz raman singh ke liye 9 july, 2012 kaa din behad sukun bharaa rahaa
 This date could prove to be a strong foundation in their third innings preparations
 apano or vipaksh kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr singh ne sarkari naukariyon or shaikshanik sansthaanon main anusuchit jati kaa kota chaar fisadi ghataakar janajatiyon kaa kota 12 fisadi badha diya
 This was stayed by the Bilaspur High Court, but after the government's plea, the court has now lifted the ban and opened the way for the implementation of 58 percent reservation
 aarakshan par adaalat kaa antim faisla vistrut sunwaayee ke baad aayega
 Even after the formation of a separate state, the condition of not getting reservation according to the population was in this society for the last 11 years
 isi saal 18 janvari ko sarkaar ne aarakshan niti main sanshodhan kii adhisuchana jari kii or 16 march ko vidhansabha ne anusuchit janajatiyon, jatiyon or anya pichde virgon ke liye aarakshan kanoon- 2012 paarit kar diya
 According to this law, the reservation of Scheduled Tribes (ST) was increased from 20 to 32 per cent
 lekin anusuchit jati (essi) kaa kota 16 se ghatakar 12 fisadi ho gaya, jabaki anya pichde varg ke 14 fisadi aarakshan cote se koi chhedchhad nahin kii gai
 Guru Ghasidas Sahitya and Culture Academy filed a petition in the High Court against this
 is kanoon par 13 april ko hycourt kii roak se raman sarkaar kii saansen phool gayi, kyonki purana kanoon khatm ho chukaa tha or nae kanoon par roak se sabhi bhartiyon saamaanya tareeke se kerani padatin
 After this argument, the court lifted the ban under an interim order
 isse raahat mahasoos kar rahe mukhyamantri ne india today ko bataaya, ''jatiyon kii aabaadi ke mutabik aarakshan tay kiya gaya he, jiske liye vidhansabha ne kanoon banaaya he
 Our opinion was appropriate by the court
 ''lekin essi kaa kota ghataae jane ke mudde par raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 Former chief minister Ajit Jogi says, "increasing the quota of tribes is a good initiative, but we oppose reducing SC quota
" sarkaar ko 50 fisadi kii seemaa paar hi kerani thi to 58 kii jagah 62 fisadi kar leti
 It is wrong to reduce SC quota and not increase OBC quota
 nishchit taur par yah hamaara ek chunavi mudda hoga
 "but, countering Jogi's objection, Raman Singh says," If Jogi has objections, first get your central government to agree
 centre ne to paanch saal pehle notification jari kar diya tha, jisamen 2001 kii janaganana ke aadhaar par asti ke liye 32, essi ke liye 12 or obisi ke liye 6 fisadi aarakshan karne kii baat thi
 "A section of BJP is also angry with this decision of Raman government
 sutron ke mutabik, pradesh ke samskruti mantri brijmohan agarwal ne yathasthiti banaae rakhane par hi jor diya tha
 Many upper caste leaders of the party were also in favor of the current situation
 rajya essi ayog ke adhyaksh or bijepi vidhayak dow
 Krishnamurthy Bandhi is also hurt by the reduction of SC quota
 ve kehete hai, ''centre ne anusuchit jati kaa kota kam karne ko kaha tha
 How can any state ignore the notification of the Center
 ''lekin raman singh philhal jaldi main hai kyonki chunaav sir par he
 Feeling relieved Raman wants to give wings to his electoral strategy through this reservation, the Congress is trying to woo both sc-sts by arguing the Supreme Court fixed limit

 Fallahi was arrested on 27 September 2001, the night the SIMI was banned
 unke upar lagaae gaye aarope sahi na paae jane par 7 april, 2004 ko unhen bari kar diya gaya
 However, he is still accused in some cases
 haalanki, agast 2008 main ek vishesh nyaayaadhikaran ne simi par se pratibandh hataa liya lekin baad main supreme court ne 6 agast 2008 ko pratibandh uchit tehraaya
 It was from SIMI that the Indian Mujahideen organization emerged, which became a new face of terror in the country

 kendriya ispaat mantri choudhary birendra singh ne mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter se kaha ki haryana ke 25 ilaakon kaa bhi vikaas karen
 Khattar immediately reassured him that there was no prejudice against anyone in Haryana and would not happen
 unka dhyaan puure haryana par he
 In Jind's Gaurav Rally on Sunday, Birendra Singh said in the presence of BJP President Amit Shah that 25 areas of central Haryana have always been backward in terms of development
 in ilaakon ko kisi ne tavajjo nahin di
 Always treated stepmother
 isliye mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter se wo chaahate hai ki in 25 ilaakon kaa vikaas bhi baaki ilaakon kii tarah karen
 Singh also asked Amit Shah to give notice to the Haryana government that he should also pursue these 25 areas
 unka vikaas karen
 When Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar stood up to speak, he responded to Birendra Singh's saying that the entire Haryana is his own
 vah pureharyana kaa vikaschahte hai
 He does not discriminate against any area
 isliye aisa kabhi nahin hoga ki in 25 ilaakon ko chhod diya jayega or baaki haryana ko tavajjo di jaaegi
 If there has been a shortage or if the previous governments have made a shortage, then these areas will be further extended along with the rest of Haryana
 choudhary birendra singh ne jat aarakshan kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki jo hamaare adhikaar kii ladaai he
 Amit Shah should also support him and there will be no harm in our fight for this right
 ham nahin chaahate ki hamaare adhikaron kii ladaai kii vajah se kisi kaa nuksaan ho

 After almost two years, Team India can field two spinners of the Firki in Tests together
 harbhajan singh or aar aswin do of spin gendbaazon ko fatullah test ke plaing 11 main jagah milanaa tay dikh rahaa he
 These two races have always challenged each other for a place, but this time they both have to write the story of victory together
 donon ke ek saath plaing 11 main hone ke do majboot kaaran nazar aate hai
 The pitch of Fatullah Stadium appeals to the spinners
 yahaan par 2005 main hue eklaute test main 37 main se 24 wicket spinners ne hi nikaale the
 Second Bangladesh team has more left batsmen, which makes the role of off-spinner important
 bhajji or aswin kii jodi bahut zyada to ek saath nahin kheli he, lekin team india ke liye ye jodi upmahadweep kii pichon par ghaatak sabit ho sakati he
 The comments donon ne teen test match ek saath khele hai, jisamen se do main bharat ko jeet mili
 In November 2012, in Mumbai Test, both together took 4 wickets, two each were named
 farvari 2013 main chennai test main milakar donon ne 15 wicket nikaale, jisamen se 12 wicket aswin ke the
 The pair took 8 wickets in the Hyderabad Test in March 2013, of which six wickets were in Ashwin's name
 in donon ke saath khilne se team menagement ko bharosa he ki donon kaa khel nikharegaa or team ko phayda hoga
 Where Bhajji will have to bowl unscathed from the shadow of his past
 vahiin videsh main flop rahane vaale aswin ko sabit karnaa he ki vah bade formet main bhi utane hi ghaatak or aakraamak hai
 Due to these two, Team India is confident of winning a Test series after about one and a half years
 ye daunon vaise to hameshaa hi ek jagah ke liye ek-duusare ko chunauti dete aae hai, lekin is baar donon ko milakar jeet kii kahani likhni hogi
 There are two strong reasons for the two to be together in Playing 11
 fatullah ke stadium kii pich spinners ko raas aati he
 Here in the 2005 single-handed test, 24 of 37 wickets were taken by the spinners
 doosraa bangladesh kii team main baayen ke ballebaaz zyada hai, jisase of spinner kaa role ahm ho jaataa he
 Bhajji and Ashwin have not played much together, but for Team India, this pair can prove to be fatal on the pitches of the subcontinent
 tippaniyan The two have played three Test matches together, winning India in two of them
 november 2012 main mumbai test main donon ne milakar 4 wicket jatke the, do-do donon ke naam rahe the
 Together, they took 15 wickets in the Chennai Test in February 2013, of which 12 wickets were from Ashwin
 march 2013 main hyderabad test main 8 wicket is jodi ne jatke, jisamen se chah wicket aswin ke naam rahe the

 assistant sab inspector se lekar disipi rank ke aise 41 pulicekarmi hai jin logon ne din raat ek kar nirbhaya cese kii jaanch kii or aropiyon ko giraftaar karne ke baad faansee ke fande tak pahunchaaya
 Their investigation was praised by the lower court, the High Court and the Supreme Court in their respective decisions
 somvaar ko police kamishnar amuly patnayak ne inhen dilli police mukhyalay bulaakar inaki hausala afjai kii
 It was the night of 16 December 2012 when Nirbhaya was gang-raped in a moving bus
 uske saath 6 logon ne aisi haivaaniyat kii ki 29 disambar ko uski ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai
 In this case, the police not only apprehended all the accused within a week, but within a mere 19 days, they also presented a charge sheet of 1000 pages in the court
 tippaniyan In this case there was no such evidence, no witness that the police did not include in its investigation
 police ne aropiyon ke pakadaney ke saath-saath jis raste se bas gai thi uskaa cctv footage baraamad kiya
 The victim's mobile phone, ATM card, gold chain and other belongings were recovered from the accused
 aropiyon or peedit kii diene jaanch karai jiskaa milan bhi sahi hua, daanton ke kaatane ke nishaan kii forensik jaanch karai gai, 50 se zyada gavaahon ke bayaan darj karaae gaye
 Not only this, the investigation covered every small point that could make the accused stand in the court
 police ne mahaz ek din ke andar singapore le jane ke liye nirbhaya ke maa-baap kaa passport banwaaya, sarojini nagar market se unke liye shopping tak kii
 Besides the 2 dcps in the team, there were several high profile inspectors and sub-inspectors
 iske alaava darjanon sipaahi bhi raat din maamle kii jaanch se jude rahe
 Police officers continued to be patient with Nirbhaya's parents, which is probably why Nirbhaya's parents continued to praise the police from the beginning of the case until the court's verdict
 is cese main aisa koi saboot, aisa koi gavaah nahin tha jise police ne apni jaanch main shaamil na kiya ho
 The police recovered the cctv footage of the accused as well as the route through which they were settled
 aropiyon ke paas se peedit kaa mobile phone, unke atm card, sone kii chen or doosraa saamaan baraamad kiya
 DNA test of the accused and the victim, which also matched, was done, forensic examination of tooth bites, statements of more than 50 witnesses were recorded
 yahi nahin, jaanch main us har chote se chote bindu ko shaamil kiya gaya jo aropiyon ko court main khadaa kar saktaa tha
 The police got Nirbhaya's parents' passport to take them to Singapore within a day, from Sarojini Nagar Market to shopping for them
 team main 2 disipi ke alaava kai tejatarraar inspector or sab inspector shaamil rahe
 Apart from this, dozens of soldiers were also involved in the investigation of the case day and night
 police adhikari lagaataar nirbhaya ke maa baap ko dhiraj bandhaate rahe, shaayad yahi vajah he ki cese kii shuruyaat se lekar court ke faisle aane tak nirbhaya ke maa baap police kii tarif karte rahe

 It is said that the enemy of the enemy is a friend, and looking at the current politics of the board, this jumla seems right too, lekin itnaa to tay he ki is puure jodtod main phayda shashaank manohar ko or nuksaan en shrinivasana ko hua he
 Public curfew has been imposed in rural areas of some districts of Jharkhand these days
 in ilaakon main logon ne baqayada board lagaakar bahari vyaktiyon or sarkari karmiyon kaa aana aana roak rakhaa he
 Not only this, the villagers have mentioned in the Board mentioning Section 244 (1) that the entry of any government / non-government employee / officer without permission of Gram Sabha is forbidden
 darasal gramin sarkari yojanaon ke dharaatal par nahin utarane se khafa hai
 On the other hand, for the land of the industries, the brokers are indulging the naive villagers in luring them to deal with the land at paltry prices
 police kii gasht badhaai gaijharkhand ke gumla jile ke ek gaanv kii seemaa ke baahar lage is board par najar daudaiye
 It clearly warns that the entry of government or non-government employees without the permission of Gram Sabha is prohibited
 darasal graminon kii naaraazgi kii vajah jameen ke dalal hai, jo jameen ke liye adivaasiyon ko bargala rahe hai
 The same situation is there in Khunti district where villagers have put up a board to this effect
 yahaan to beete dinon graminon ne police ke adhikariyon ko kuch samay ke liye bandhak bhi banaaya tha
 Khunti has about 42 such panchayats, including Bhandra Panchayat, Siladon Panchayat, Kanki, Hesahatu, Gutuwa, Landup, Murahi Panchayat, Dokad, Chamadi, Chikor, Tilma where such boards are set up by villagers
 aise main sthiti itani tanaavpurn he kii yahaan police kii gast badha di gai he
 Conspiracies under the guise of Pathalgadi, top police officers present some other arguments in this regard
 unka kahana he ki jin ilaakon main aise board lagaae gaye hai, ve kaaphi dur-daraaj ke hai, in jagahon par naksali or duusare asaamaajik tatv opium kii kheti karwaane main lage hue hai
 In such a situation, they have resorted to Pathalgadi
 vahiin gramin bhofim sehone vaale munaafe kii vajah se inkaa saath dete hai
 At the same time, the MLA of the area, Jharkhand Rural Development Minister Neelkanth Singh Munda says that Pathalgadi is actually an ancient tradition, but these days some mischievous elements are indulging in anti-government propaganda by tricking innocent villagers
 aakhir kya he patthalgadi?patthalgadi adivaasiyon kii ek pracheen parampara he
 In this, the area is declared a restricted area by burying stones
 yahaan bina gram sabha kii anumati ke kisi bhi duusare vyakti kaa pravesh varjit nahin hota
 Although in addition to Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra etc
 have also been doing the Patthalgadi tribals in the states, but the intelligence department in Jharkhand also believes that conspiracies are being hatched under the cover of Pathalgadi
 vaise khunti main police adhikariyon ko bandhak banane ke silsile main kanki ilaake ke gram pradhan ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 In the political turmoil of Maharashtra, MNS entry leader Sandeep Deshpande, how the politics of Tanjajit Pawar, taking the decision of Tanjajit Pawar, is constantly taking a turn
 ensipi-congress or shivasena ekajute hokar bhartiya janata party par hamalavar he
 Now in this political rhetoric, Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has also jumped
 manase netaa sandip deshpandey ne somvaar ko is maamle main twit kiya or vipakshi partiyon par tanj ksaa
 Sandeep Deshpande tweeted, 'happy Birthday to those who still think it's just Ajit Pawar's decision'
 sandip deshpandey ne ye twit marathi bhashaa main kiya he
 pic
 twitter
 com / kcatmfcy6r — Sandeep Deshpande (@sandeepdadarmns) November 25, 2019 Significantly, the MNS was totally calm in the matter so far, but now the way the MNS leader has tweeted it is considered to be a taunt
 haalanki, nishaanaa kahaan saadhaa ja rahaa he ye kahana mushkil he
 Sandeep Deshpande had recently shared his photo with NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 kiske saath hai ajit pavaar?gauratlab he ki ajit pavaar ne ensipi ke vidhayakon kaa samarthan patr kaa daawa kar bhartiya janata party ke saath sarkaar bana lee
 Ajit Pawar has become the Deputy Chief Minister of the state but the NCP says that this is Ajit Pawar's personal decision not the party's decision
 ajit pavaar ke saath jo vidhayakthy, unamem se adhiktar ab sharad pavaar ke paale main aate dikh rahe hai
 NCP leader Nawab Malik claims that 53 of the 54 mlas are back in his court and he may also meet the Governor soon
 supreme court main honi he sunwaayeeshivsena-congress or ensipi kii yachika par ye maamla adaalat main pahunch gaya he, supreme court aaj is maamle par faisla suna saktaa he
 In such a situation, whether the court orders the floor test or any other order is given, everyone's eye is on it
 vakt badal gaya he or mahilaayein bhi khud ko badal rahi hai
 But many men still have the same views about women as medieval society
 ve mahilaon ko ek dhale hue saanche main hi dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Most men do not like women breaking old circles
 ghor purushavaadi ise apane liye khatra maanate hai
 The big reason behind this is the thinking that has been taking place for centuries
 shaadi ko lekar bhi purush vishesh drushtikon rakhte hai
 They have a special view of women
 unhen bataaya or sikhaaya jaataa he mahilaon kii kamajori ke bare main
 This childhood learning forms the basis of future thinking
 ve mahilaon ke bare main kai purvaagrah paal lete hai, jo hakeekat se bahut alag hote hai
 The perception of common men about women is largely conservative
 mahilaayein is vichaardhaara se kahin aage or behatar hai
 So there is a need to break the mugals
 ve mugalate jo aapane abhi tak mahilaon kii soch ko lekar paal rakhe hai
 Generally, there are only three types of women in the eyes of men
 pehali, jinke saath ve time paas kar saken
 Such women should be beautiful, attractive body owners and have as many free thoughts as men want
 duusari shrenee main ve mahilaayein aati hai, jinaki deh aakarshak nahin hotin
 They like to put such women in the category of friendship, because their beauty does not look attractive to the man, so they stop at friendship only
 teesri shrenee main 'vivaah yogya' ladkiyaan aati hai
 For virginity, 'virginity' is a big requirement in 'eligible' girls
 aamtaur par purushon kii jivan inhen duvidhaon main ulajhakar rah jaataa he
 Most Indian men have 9 special beliefs about their bride: 1
 aamtaur par purush yah sochate hai ki uski hone vaali bibi ‘kunvaari’ ho
 He has never had a physical relationship with anyone
 bhale hi ve khud kitni hi ladakiyon ke saath aisa kar chuke hon
 They forget that when they do not feel obliged to wear Mangalsutra for sex, why do they expect women to maintain virginity till marriage
 2
 She is of religious nature and believes all traditions
 par kuch ladkiya aisi bhi hoti hai jinhen puja-paath pasand nahin hota, jo dharmik rudhiyon main vishwaas nahin karatin
 Men want women to fast for them
 parivaar ke sabhi dharmik kaaryon main ruchi le, bhale hi unhen pasand ho yaa na ho
 They themselves do not like to do this
 darasal, aamtaur par bhartiya purush bivi ke rup main aisi stri kii chahat rakhte hai, jo unki suvidha anusaar aadhuniktaa or paaramparikta ke bich shift hoti rahe
 3
 zyaadaatar purushon ko lagata he ki mahilaayein sirf bachche paidaa karne ke liye or unke paalan-poshan ke liye bani hai
 But this is not the case
 aakhir bachche aap donon ke hai, to unhen paalane kii jimmedaari sirf mahilaon kii hi kyon ho? aaj ke daur main ladkiyaan apane kariyar par zyada dhyaan detii he
 She wants the responsibility of the children to come late on her and even if she comes, her partner should also share this responsibility
 or partner ko aisa karnaa bhi chahie
 The child is the shared responsibility of both of you
 4
 It is said that the way of a man's heart goes through his stomach and it seems that men have taken this matter very seriously
 ve maanate hai ki jis ladki se unki shaadi ho rahi he, unhen khaanaa pakaana jarur aata hota
 But, it is not necessary to have this 'skill' in every girl
 unki abhiruchi or visheshgyata anya kshetron main ho sakati he, lekin khaanaa pakaane main unhen dilchaspee ho yah jaruri nahin
 They neither like working in the kitchen nor do they have any qualms about this
 5
 Husband is now the era of God
 bhul jaaie ki aapaki ek aawaaj par aapaki patni aapke saamne karbaddh khadi ho
 Only your needs should be his priority, those days are over
 aaj kii mahilaayein apane hiton or siddhanton se samjhauta nahin karatin
 This is due to their confidence
 ve aarthik or saamaajik rup se samrudh ho rahi hai
 Of course, she will listen to you, but after examining the logic of her argument, she will decide to accept or deny it
 aap jivan kii gaadi main uske saathi hai, us gaadi ke driver nahin
 6
 rudhivaadee purushon kii najar main mahilaon ko kariyar ke bare main zyada nahin sochna chahie
 Bringing money for home, men consider it their responsibility or right to say
 ve maanate hai ki yadi mahilaayein apane kariyar par zyada focus karengi, to ve apni paariwarik jimmedaariyon se bhatak jaaengi
 They want to see women within the purview of the responsibility of home and children
 agar, kahin agar mahilaon kii tankhwaah purushon se zyada ho jaae, to purush ahan kaa sawaal bana lete hai
 7
 unhen lagata he ki unki hone vaali patni unke mata-pita kii puri dekhbhaal kare
 But when it comes to the wife's parents, they consider them beyond their responsibility
 phir apni hone vaali patni se ye ummid karnaa kitna sahi he
 8
 purushon ko ye pansad nahin hota ki uski patni apane purush mitron se dosti rakhen yaa unase baat karen
 While they do not allow these conditions to apply to themselves
 9
 He does not like that his future wife should be more open-minded
 ve nahin chaahate ki vah sex jaise muddon par khulkar baat kare
 But perhaps you have heard Vidya Balan in 'koffee with Karan' saying that the way women enjoy sex, the way women enjoy sex the same way
 to hujur, mahilaayein to badalte vakt ke saath badal gayi, ab baari aapaki he
 Change your mind

 maharashtra ke purv divangat mukhyamantri vilasarav deshmukh ke bete or bollywood actor ritesh deshmukh ne somvaar ko kendriya mantri piyush goyal ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya

 It is also true that i was with my father but it is a lie that he was trying to show me the role in the film
 unhone kabhi kisi nirdeshak yaa nirmaataa se film main mujhe sin karne ko nahin kaha
 i am proud of it
 aapako ek mukhyamantri se sawaal poochne kaa puraa haq he lekin kisi aise shaks par aarope lagaana galat he, jo safai dene ke liye maujuud nahin he
