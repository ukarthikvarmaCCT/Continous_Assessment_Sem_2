 Rajesh Kumar Mishra, who lives and lives in New Patta, Allahabad, has a feeling of satisfaction on his face today
 vajah yah he ki unki sabase choti beti sonam ko ejineering kii padhai puri karte hi acchhee naukari mil gai
 Sonam completed her b
tech from Allahabad's United Group of Engineering this year and was selected in the Infosys company in campus interviews
 rajesh kehete hai, ''ghar ke paas hi acchhee takneekee shiksha uplabdh hone ke kaaran maine apane bacchon ko elahabaad main hi padhaane kaa faisla kiya
 Prior to Sonam, my elder son got a MCA from the United Institute of Technology in 2008 and got a job as a software engineer in a private company in Noida
 ab lagata he, meraa faisla sahi tha
 "not only this, the success of Naveen Goswami, a student of Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology, Greater Noida, is also very successful
 beatech ke is chaatr ko america company heliks ne 50 lakh ru
 Have given the job on the package of yearly
 in dinon uttar pradesh ke takneekee shikshan santhaan kamyaabi ke nae mukaam hasil kar rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh was considered 'barren' in terms of technical education some 15-16 years ago
 tab sarkari kshetra se itar nijee kshetra main takneekee shiksha kaa paridrishy kaaphi dhundhala tha
 As a result, a large number of students migrated to the southern states to pursue engineering
 magar beete 10 saal se rajya main takneekee or peshewar shiksha kaa paridrishy teji se badla he
 While there were only 43 institutes in the state for btech in 2001-02, after five years their number has increased to 91 in 2006-07
 2011-12 main in sansthaaon kii kul sankhya 291 he
 The main reason for the rapid increase in the number of institutes associated with technical education is the increasing trend of students towards employment-oriented courses
 yahi vajah he ki rajya main lakhanu kii gautam buddha technical uniwarsity (jibitiu) or noida kii mahamaya technical uniwarsity (emtiu) se sambhddha takneekee or peshewar shikshan sansthaanon kii sankhya 750 tak pahunch gai he, jinamein 3,50,000 chaatr padhai kar rahe hai
 This changed attitude of students and parents presents a challenge to technical and professional colleges: quality education
 yadi gunvattta sunishchit nahin ho saki to rajya main takneekee shiksha ke vikaas ke aankadon main badhotaree kii baat karnaa bemaani he
 So the difference between good and bad institutions is increasing
 yahi vajah he ki technical uniwarsity se jude 30 fisadi sansthaanon kii puri siten nahin bhar paa raheen
 Satpal Gulati, chairman of the United Group of Institutions, points to one aspect of this
 ve kehete hai, ''paise waalon ke paas jahaan jameen thim, vahiin par unhone ejineering yaa management college khol liye
 But the students did not pay any attention to their utility
 aise santhaan chaatro ko aakarshith karne main fail ho rahe hai
 This is the reason that more than 150 institutes have sought permission for detention from All India Council for Technical Education
 ''haalanki iskaa ek pahalu yah he ki jitani teji se nijee collejon kaa vistaar hua, us anupaat main in collejon ko gunvatttaparak maanav sansaadhan nahin mil paae or iskaa asar padhai par bhi padaa
 If on one hand there are colleges which are not able to meet their prescribed number of students, on the other hand there are also institutions which continue to increase their quality and remain the center of attraction of the students

 Socialist parties have expanded the personal empire in the name of secularism, but is it the politics of leaders who oppose the politics of secularism without money and resources

 Can the opposition gain the morality to fight on the strength of corruption-ridden leaders? It is okay that the responsibility of the Vyapam scam did not come on the Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh Minister Narottam Mishra did not resign even after the media was accused of publishing the news by giving money, there was no progress in the irrigation scam in Maharashtra, it is being said That is cool because NCP can be an ally of BJP

 See the headline of the Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke mantri brijmohan agarwal kaa bayaan he ki agar aarope sabit hua to sarkaar kii zamin lautaa denge
 This is morality
 abhi tak mantri kehete the ki aarope sabit hoga to raajnneeti chhod denge, istipha denge lekin pehali baar koi mantri kah rahaa he ki sarkaar kii jo zamin patni ne kathith taur par kharidi he, wo aarope sahi hua to zamin lautaa denge
 This statement of Brajmohan Agrawal will be a relief to many
 kah denge ki bhrashtachar pakadayega to paisa lautaa denge
 It is also good that the campaign against corruption is quite active in the opposition camp itself, but are there no leaders within the BJP or its allies who have benami property or who have the resources to collect from corruption

 All these are not normal processes of Indian politics
 shivasena bijepi kii sahyogi or centre or maharashtra main bijepi ke saath sarkaar main he
 When the government of Uttarakhand was illegally dropped in March 2016, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray gave a statement
 unhone kaha tha, 'uttarakhand main jo ho rahaa he wo loktantr ke liye sharmnaak he
 The democratically elected governments should be removed only in that manner
 ek hi dal kii satta kii aakanksha taanaashaahee or apatkaal se bhi khataranaak he
 ' nitish ke dobaaraa bijepi ke saath aane se raajnneeti badal gai he
 It remains to be seen how Nitish Kumar's experience is with modi-shah's aggressive BJP before or after 2019
 philhal samaajawaadee andolan se bhi bharat kii raajnneeti mukti kii taraf prashast lag rahi he
 Not only the Congress, regional parties standing in the name of opposition to the Congress are also facing challenges of survival
 jadyu ke kerala unit kii khabar jab indian express main dekhi to achaanak khyaal aayaa ki samaajawaadee andolan kaa kahaan tak vistaar tha
 From there, JDU MP Virender Kumar said that he is ready to resign from the House
 nitish kumaar se hamaara sambandh samaapt ho gaya he
 Ali Anwar, a Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar, has called it a national accident but has not said anything more
 upi main samaajawaadee andolan ne bijepi ne kuchlaa magar kaaran us andolan main hi tha
 Taking the name of socialism in SP and National Lok Dal, these leaders went elsewhere
 isliye ab samaajawaadee dhade kii raajnneetik praasangikta kamazor padati ja rahi he
 It would have been better for Lalu Yadav to answer all the allegations and also change the structure of his party
 samaajawaadee dalon ne dharmanirpekshata ke naam par vyaktigat samrajya kaa hi vistaar kiya he lekin aisa kya dharmanirpekshata kii raajnneeti kaa virodh karne vaale netaaon kii raajnneeti bagair paise or sansadhano ke hi chalati he
 If the big parties have a lot of money or support of the corporation, then these small parties may have corruption
 2015 main susheel modi nitish kumaar par dhokhaa dene kaa aarope laga rahe the, 2017 main rahul gandhi dhokhaa dene kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 In politics, all these allegations have become like the dialogues of the theater
 bhartiya raajnneeti abhi bechainiyon ke daur se guzar rahi he varanaa jo netaa sabase surakshit or lokapriy sthiti main hai wo duusare dalon ke angan main shikaar karte nazar na aate
 The comments is sankat ke baad kii daleelon main congress par khub hamale ho rahe hai
 There is a migration of leaders from the Congress
 congress se gathbandhan nahin sanbhal rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that politics has no credibility
 yahi baat un par bhi lagu hoti he jitani dusron par lagu hoti he
 Seeing the participation of the public, it does not seem that politics does not have credibility
 2019 main ab ladaai ek tarafa ho chuki he
 Was the opposition weak because of Nitish Kumar, or was the opposition weak and lazy
 kya bhrashtachar main duube netaaon ke dam par vipaksh ladane kii naitikta hasil kar saktaa he? thik he ki vyapam ghotaale kii javabdehi mukhyamantri par nahin ai, media ko paise dekar khabar chhapavane kaa aarope sabit hone ke baad bhi madhya pradesh ke mantri narottam mishra ne istipha nahin diya, maharashtra main sinchai ghotaale main koi pragati nahin hui, kaha ja rahaa he ki isliye thanda he kyonki ensipi bijepi kii sahyogi ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, a new morality has been launched
 indian express kii hedline dekhiye
 Chhattisgarh Minister Brijmohan Agrawal has said that if the charge is proved, he will return the land of the government
 ye hui naitikta
 Till now, the minister used to say that if the charge is proved, he will quit politics, resign, but for the first time a minister is saying that the land which the wife has allegedly bought for the government, will return the land if the allegations are true
 brajmohan agarwal kaa yah bayaan kaiyon ko raahat dene vaala hoga
 We will say that if corruption is caught, we will return the money
 yah bhi acha he ki vipaksh ke kheme main hi sahi, bhrashtachar ke khilf abhiyaan kaaphi sakriy he lekin kya bhaajapa yaa uske sahyogi dalon ke bheetar aise netaa nahin hai jinke paas benami sampatti he yaa jinke paas bhrashtachar se jutaaye sansaadhan hai
 Himanta Viswa Sarma is a powerful minister of Assam, when he was in Congress, BJP used to accuse him of scam, now reports of investigation of those scams have slowed down
 uttarakhand sarkaar me main bhi aise mantri hai jo congress sarkaar main mantri the to un par bijepi bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati thi
 By the way, the Lokpal has not come yet
 sarkaar ban gai he naitikta par bahes kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Politics has changed with Nitish coming back to BJP
 abhi dekhnaa baaki he ki 2019 ke pehle yaa uske baad modi-shah kii aakraamak bijepi ke saath nitish kumaar kaa anubhav kaisaa rahata he
 At present, the politics of India is also looking towards liberation from the socialist movement

 gujarat chunaav ke duusare charan main voting ke dauraan kai jagah hinsa or jhadap kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 There was a ruckus between the two groups in Vadodara and Mehsana
 mehsana jile kii visanagar ke hasanpur gaanv ke matdaan karne aae do guton ke bich jamkar hangaamaa hua jiske baad ugr logon ne todphod kiya
 More than half a dozen people have been injured in the stone-pelting on both sides
 paas khadi biken or gaadiyaan jala di gayi
 The second case has also been fiercely disrupted between tow groups in Wankner village of Savli tehsil of Vadodara district
 gussai bheed ne ek motor cycle ko aag ke hawaale kar diya he
 The police and paramilitary force arrived at Tabardodamake and took appropriate steps to normalize the situation
 bavaal ke chalate aadhe ghante tak matdaan kii prakriya main baadha ai or rokna pad gaya
 Please tell that by taking strict action of the police, we have made a tight arrangement in the village of Wankaner
 gujarat chunaav ke duusare charan kii voting ke dauraan bhi congress ne iviem se chhedchhad kaa mudda uthaate hue chunaav ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 The Congress has accused the evms of connecting to Bluetooth at a booth in Mehsana in the state
 mehsana vidhansabha seat se dipti siem nitin patel bijepi ke ummidavaar hai or unka muqabla congress ke jeevabhai patel se he
 a contest of thorn between the two parties is seen on this seat
 congress ne mehsana ke ek booth paraiviem ke bluetooth se conectahone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The Congress said that a device named 'ECO 105' appears on the mobile phone's Bluetooth at Mehsana's booth
 isse ye pataa chal rahaa he ki EVM ko blue tooth ke jariye ho rahaa he
 Significantly, even during the first phase of voting, its leader Arjun Morwadhia on behalf of the Congress claimed that electronic voting machines were connected to external devices via Bluetooth in three polling booths of Memonwada, a Muslim dominated area of porbandar
 jab bhi kisi mobile phone kaa bluetooth on kiya jaataa he to ‘isio 105’ naam kaa ek upkaran uplabdh dikhaai detaa he
 This clearly means that electronic voting machines can be tampered using the device via Bluetooth
 mukhya chunaav adhikari (siio) bibi swine ne haalanki congress kii is shikaayat ko ye kehete hue khaarij kar diya gaya tha ki ek matdaan agent ke paas mobile phone tha jis par ‘isio 105’ model number ke taur par ankit tha
 In this, the complainant considered EC as Election Commission
 aaj kii bhaag daud bhari jindagi main zyaadaatar log naukari pesha ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, after getting tired of working in office for 9-10 hours, cooking food at home has become a big challenge
 aise main baahar khaanaa khaanaa ek acha opshan najar aata he lekin ham sab jaanate he ki roj roj baahar kaa khaanaa khaanaa kaise hamaara bajet bigaad detaa he
 That is why there is a need to keep in mind such things that you can eat outside food and also save money
 jaaniye ye 10 tips :1) coupon kaa istemaal karanjab kabhi bhi aap akele yaa apane parivaar ke saath baahar khaanaa khaane jaaen to koshish karen ki discount ophers yaa coupon kaa istemaal karen isse aap kaa bajet bhi nahin bigadega or aap baahar ke khaane kaa swaad bhi le paaenge
 2) Avoid giving tip If your budget is low then try not to tip the waiter after having dinner
 aisa karne se aap restaurant main khaane ke dauraan thode paise bachaa sakate hai
 3) Go to lunch instead of dinner
 We all know that lunch is cheaper than dinner
 isiilie dinar ke bajaay lunch par janaa baahar khaanaa khaane ke dauraan paise bachaane kaa ek acha opshan he
 4) Avoid taking a drink We often see that any drink in the restaurant, whether hard or soft, is expensive
 yahi drink aap baahar kii shop se le to restaurant ke mukaable kam paise main kharid sakate he aisa isliye kyonki restra main isamen sarvice charge bhi jod diya jaataa he
 5) If you study in school or college or anyone who is fond of eating outside, then this method will save you a lot of money
 koi bhi cheez order karen or use share karke khaaen aise aap kai varaiti bhi kha paaenge saath hi paise bhi kam dene hogen
 6) Become a favorite customer: There are restaurants, dhabas or stalls that offer special offers to their favorite customers
 aisa karne ke liye aap unke websij, fasebuk pej ko like follow kar sakate hai
 7) Check Daily Deal Site If you want to eat outside food for less money, then there are many sites on which different offers are given everyday
 behatar hoga ki aap lagaataar apadated rahen or kam paise main swaadisht khaane kaa lutf uthaaen
 8) Avoid ordering sugary after meals
 Most people order swat dis after eating which increases their bill
 koshish karen kii ise na order karen or agar khaanaa hi he to baahar se khariden yaa pack kara len
 9) Drink more water; Drinking more water is beneficial for health and at the same time, if the stomach is full of water, then the hunger also reduces
 aise main baahar order bhi kam karte he or paise batch jate hai
 10) Order on the basis of hunger, many times it happens that we order many things and later it gets saved due to excess manga and it has to be thrown away
 isiilie soch samaj kar hi order den

 She was around

 In this press conference, the Law Board questioned the decision on several points and said that there are many flaws in this decision, so a reconsideration petition is necessary
 masjid ke badale main musalmaan koi duusari jagah sweekaar nahin karegaa
 We did not go to the Supreme Court to get the second mosque
 yah bhi padhein:masjid ke liye duusari jagah jameen kyon nahin legaa AIMPLB, bataai vajahis press conference main muslim board ne kai sawaal khadey kiye hai
 1
 muslim board ne kaha ki supreme court ke 9-11-2019 ke faisle main kuch mudde saamne aae hai
 The Board says that the construction of the Babri Masjid was done by Babur Commander Mir Baqi in 1528 as admitted by the litigants of Case No
5 in their suit and accepted by the Supreme Court
 2
 Based on the evidence given by the Muslims, it is proved that from 1857 to 1949 the three-domed building of the Babri Masjid and the inner interior of the mosque have been in the possession and use of the Muslims
 ise bhi supreme court ne sweekaar kiya he
 3
 jab 22 / 23 disambar 1949 kii raat main balpurvak rakhi gai ramchandraji kii murti tathaa anya murtiyon kaa rakhaa janaa avaidhanik tha to is prakanvaidhanik rup se rakhi gai murtiyon ko Deity kaise maan liya gaya he, jo hindi dharamshastra ke anusaar bhi Deity nahin ho sakati he
 4
 jab babari masjid main 1857 se 1949 tak musalamaanon kaa kabja rahaa or namaaj padhaa janaa sabit mana gaya he to masjid kii jameen ko vaad sankhya 5 ke vaadi sankhya 1 ko kis aadhaar par de diya gaya?5
 While using Article 142 of the Constitution, the Honorable Justice did not consider that the exchange or transfer of mosque land under Section 104-A and 51 (1) of the Waqf Act 1995 has been completely obstructed against the Statute And how can the above statutory moratorium / prohibition be given to other land in lieu of the land of Tehmatsjid under Article 142? It has been made clear that no limit is fixed for the honorable justices to exercise the authority of Article 142
 6
 The Board has said that it was decided to file a reconsideration petition considering the above facts and the Supreme Court's decision being the above and other apparent eroros, which would also refer to the fact that in return for the mosque land, the Muslims Please be pleased to give the land of Babri Masjid
 musalmaan kisi duusare sthaan par apana adhikaar lene ke liye supreme court nahin gaye the balki masjid kii bhoomi hetu nyaay ke liye supreme court gaye the
 ALSO READ: AIMPLB to file review petition on Ayodhya, land not approved for mosque; Muslim board also states that land below the dome between Babri Masjid is not proven to be worshiped as a birthplace
 
 at: suut 5 ke vaadi sankhya 2(janmasthan) ko Deity hin mana ja saktaa he
 The press release issued by AIMPLB was against the constitution, the suit filed by the Babri demolition authorities is within the 4 time limit (partially) and is partially decreeable
 court ne bhi mana he ki 6 disambar ko babari masjid giraae jane kaa kaam bharat ke secular savindhan ke khilaaf tha
 The High Court has questioned the attitude of NDMC regarding street vendors
 hai court ne kaha aap survey kaise kar sakati he jab tak ki street vendors act ke praavdhaan ke khilaaf ho
 NDMC argues that NDMC has a different area than the rest of Delhi's MCD
 lihaaza yahan par survey puraa karne kii court ijazat de de kyonki isse hi ye saafe hoga ki vahaan ke asli street vendors koun he
 NDMC argued that there could be more than one scheme for street vendors in cities like Delhi Mumbai but the court was not satisfied with NDMC
 court ne kaha ki hamaare agle aadesh kaa intazaar karen
 The survey has been 90 percent or 80 percent does not matter
 street vendors ke liye skim bani he jab tak sarkaar use lagu nahin karti he tab tak unako kaise survey karke unako hataa sakati he
 Why did you form a town vending committee when the scheme itself has not been implemented yet
 act sirf vending jone kii baat karata he
 The High Court also asked what has happened to create a no vending zone
 or jab us par koi amal ho nahin ho paa rahaa he tab tak vendors ko lekar hone vaale survey kaa koi matlab nahin hai

 Talking about Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav and his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav are openly exposed in the Yadav family after Lalu Prasad Yadav is out of the political scenario

 Angered by his ignorance, the elder brother has formed a separate front in the name of lalu-rabri

 His biggest resentment is for giving ticket to father-in-law Chandrika Rai from Saran seat

 However, a divorce petition was filed by Tejapratap within less than six months of marriage

 It is a difficult situation for the selectors but my point of view is that he should be given more and more responsibility
 ’ Navjot Singh Sidhu, like his cricket days, is in attacking form in politics these days
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav main amritsar east seat se congress ummidavaar siddhu chunaav prachaar main bhi frontroot par aakar batting kar rahe hai
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Sidhu answered the questions with the same carelessness for which Sidhuvani is known
 congress agar punjab main chunaav jitati he to kya siddhu mukhyamantri banane kii ichha rakhte hai, is sawaal kaa siddhu ne sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 But it definitely said that who will become the Chief Minister, it decides the MLA and the high command of the party, the senior leader decides, the first task is to win the election 
 siddu ne punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ko do ankhon vaala dhritarashtra bataaya, jinhen apane parivaar ke sivaa or kuch najar nahin aata
 In response to a question, Sidhu revealed that Badal had a conspiracy behind not allowing him to contest from Amritsar seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 aise hoti he siddhu ke din kii shuruyaat'aaj tak' ne siddhu ke saath din bitaakar dekha ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan unki vyastata kisi chal rahi he
 Sidhu's day begins with meditation and meditation in the gurudwara
 shuddh shaakaahaari siddhu ne bataaya ki wo subah naashte main ek akhrot, 5 baadaam, chaay ke saath khaakara jaisi ek roti or kuch fal lete hai
 In the afternoon take two loaves and one loaf before the sun sets
 suraj dhalane ke baad kuch nahin khate
 This is the reason why they wake up at three thirty in the morning and concentrate
 party vidhayakon or alaakaman tay karegi siemsiddhu se jab poocha gaya ki kya wo punjab kaa siem banane kii ichha rakhte hai to unhone kaha ki maan-sammaan use nahin miltaa jo uski ichha karata he
 It is found by one who keeps on his duty path without making a wish
 meraa kartavya he congress party ko ikattha rakhana kyonki congress ko virdohi nahin haraa sakate, congress ko khud congressi hi haraa sakate hai
 He said that i said this to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi that they have the same agenda and that is to uplift Punjab
 jab siem banane kii chahat se sambandhit sawaal siddhu se dobaaraa poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki mere munh main shabd mat daaliye
 This party will decide the MLA and the high command
 varisht netaa tay karenge
 According to Sidhu, his focus is on winning the Congress in Punjab
 vidhayak banakar logon kii aawaaj buland karne par he jisase punjab ko badahaali se khushhaali kii ore le jaaya ja sake
 Jaitley my Guru, i will not speak anything against him
 The allegation of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that Sidhu is a person without ideology and he has made politics a counter to the bargain
 siddhu ne kaha ki wo mere guru hai unke bare main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 Sidhu further said that if even a single person comes and says that Sidhu ever asked for something for himself, then he is ready to give up politics
 saansad rahane ke dauraan sansad nahin jane or apane chunaav kshetra se dur rahane ke aaropon par siddhu ne kaha ki you tub par 'navjot siddhu on heritage city' link ko dekh lijie ki siddhu ne sansad main kya-kya bolaa
 'two-eyed Dhritarashtra is Badal' Sidhu described Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal as two-eyed Dhritarashtra who cannot see anything other than his family
 siddhu ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main amritsar se unhen chunaav naa ladane dene ke liye badal par sajeesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sidhu said that Badal thought that if he wants to finish Sidhu then do this work with his party
 isliye mere guru (arun jetali) ko amritsar laakar chunaav ladava diya gaya
 Sidhu denied that he had expressed his displeasure at making Jaitley a candidate from Amritsar in his place
 meraa muqabla khud seyah puche jane par ki kejariwal yaa badal main se kise mukhya pratidwandvi maanate hai to siddhu ne kaha ki chunaav main mukaable main har party aati he
 i believe in being on my side
 meraa muqabla khud se he
 They are adopting all kinds of tactics
 lekin main satya ke paksh main hum, satya hi parameshwar he
 Gandhiji had the truth because of which the world will always remember him
 siddhu ke maathe par likhaa he 'note for cell'siddhu ne punjab ke upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal ke is aarope ko galat bataaya ki siddhu bikaoo hai
 Sidhu said that 'not for sale' is written on Siddhu's forehead
 ek bhi vyakti nahin kah saktaa ki siddhu ne apane liye yaa parivaar ke liye kabhi kuch maanga ho
 Sidhu asked for the Badal family that they grabbed the state treasury and filled it with them
 apni companiyaan bana lee
 In Tamil Nadu, 25 to 30 thousand crore revenue comes from 6000 contracts
 punjab main ye sirf 5000 karod jutate hai
 Roadways buses are in loss, but their eight companies are in profit
 mining se 5-10 hajaar karod aate hai lekin rajya ko sirf 50 karod jaataa he
 Sidhu said that he is showing disenchantment, he will stand up in the guise of religion and attack, but what is Sidhu, all these people know very well
 politics main aata he sabase zyada anandpolitics, kamedi sho yaa cricket, kis main sabase zyada anand lete hai, is sawaal ke jawaab main siddhu ne politics kaa naam liya
 Sidhu said that he was fortunate to have played cricket for 20 years, becoming an MP three times
 siddhu ne jor dekar kaha ki koi sachcha-succha insaan politics main kaman sanbhale to logon kii jindagi tabdeel kar saktaa he
 Can make people's lives happy
 siddhu ke mutabik wo hameshaa kehete hai ki ibaadat nahin he sirf maala ghuma dena, ibaadat he kisi bhukhe ko khilaa dena, rote ko hansaa dena, ujde ko basaa dena

 Kanhaiya Kumar is proven to be innocent in the case of the ruckus that took place last year in JNU and the anti-national slogans
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki dilli police jald hi chargeshit file kar degi
 Aaj Tak interacted with Kanhaiya Kumar in which he spoke with great confidence
 kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha, "ham naare lagaate hai lekin desh ke khilaaf nahin, sarkaar kii jan virdohi nitiyon ke khilaaf naare lagaate hai
 We raise slogans for the betterment of the country, not to weaken the country
 naare lage the wo desh virdohi hai yaa nahin ye tay karne kaa adhikaar court kaa he
 We have repeatedly said that the police should file a charge sheet and there should be a speedy trial in this case and those who are involved, if the court finds them guilty then the court should punish them

 This trial should not be held against anyone

 Calling for strict action by Kanhaiya, Kanhaiya said, "now the question is that the country's home minister was linking my link with Hafiz Saeed on the basis of fake tweet
 mere upar hamale bhi kiye
 Even today i am abused
 jahaan kahin bhi main program karne jaataa hum mere upar hamale hote hai

 "no one like Anil Vij has the right to take away the rights of Gurmehar Kaur
 Speaking on Anil Vij's comment, Kanhaiya said," These are the links of the Sanghis who have always been there

 11 of his people have been caught spying for ISI

 The fast bowling trio of Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson on 21 wickets from the subcontinent helped the spinners
 76 kii ausat se 21 wicket liye hai
 Against Kenya, Krejza and Smith lost runs in the middle overs, while Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara played them easily in a rain-washed match
 ponting ne kaha, ‘main chaahunga ki spinner kamyaabi hasil karenge
 In the middle overs, when the ball becomes old and the wicket starts to spin, then our spinners should take wickets but this is not happening
 ’ponting ne kaha, ‘maine spinneron ke saath kai prayog kiye
 Smith was also handed bowling in the Powerplay to give him more experience
 usne pehali baar aisa kiya or ummid he ki uske liye yah acha hoga
 'he further said,' Jasan also did some experiments
 usne spin lete wicket par adhik gendbaaji kii taaki halaat ke anukool khud ko dhaal sake
 Four-time champions Australia have registered three wins so far while one match being a tie
 ab uskaa iraadaa canada par dhamaakedaar jeet darj karne kaa hoga
 Wednesday's match is also the last chance of experimentation in the batting order as Australia have to play their last league match with Pakistan

 There will be many of us who do not like combing hair at all
 kai to aise bhi honge jinhen baalo main kanghee karnaa samay barbaad karne jaisaa lagata hoga
 But you will be surprised to know that combing hair is very important not only for good look but also for hair health
 par baalo ko kanghee karne ke kuch khaas niyam bhi hai
 Wet hair should never be combed, because then the hair is weak
 aise main kanghee karnaa aapke liye nuksaandaayak ho saktaa he
 Also it is not correct to comb too much
 kanghee karne ke ye paanch phaayde aapako yah bataane ke liye kaaphi hai ki kanghee karnaa kyon jaruri he:1
 Hair comb makes hair healthy and shiny
 baalo main kanghee karnaa baalo kii massage karne jaisaa hota he
 It also makes hair soft
 2
 By combing the hair, pores and oil glands are opened, due to which the roots of hair get more and more nutrition and they become healthy
 3
 Regular combing in the hair increases blood circulation, which gives oxygen and other nutrients in sufficient quantity to the hair
 isse bal healdi hote hai
 4
 baalo main kanghee karne se baalo main fanse dhul ke kan or duusari gandagi saaf ho jaati he, jisase scalp saaf rahati hai

 ) Instant messaging app whatsapp is flooded with fake news
 lekin ab child pornography ke liye bhi ise jam kar yuj kiya ja rahaa he
 Child pornography traders are using whatsapp for their content distribution
 chunki watsap kii koi monitering nahin kii ja sakati, isliye aise contant teji se viral bhi ho rahe hai
 According to a report by Tech Crunch, such content escapes from automated systems due to lack of human moderators
 israel kii do enjio kii report ke mutabik watsap group dhundne vaale third party eps aise invite links dete hai yugers se child pornography meterial kii trading karne ke liye kehete hai
 Tech Crunch has found in its investigation that many such groups are active
 anti exploetesan starop antitoxin ke mutabik inamen se kuch grups ye tak hide nahin karte ki wo kya kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that it is a crime according to Indian law to keep or share the content related to child pornography
 aisa karne baari jurmaane ke saath jail bhi ho sakati he
 According to a report in the Financial Times, the researcher earlier this year has seen child abuse material on whatsapp which are in large quantities and are in whatsapp chat groups
 report ke mutabik kuchwatsapagrup kaa naam child porn bhi he jo kaaphi gambhir masalaa he
 a report also stated that whatsapp has smart scanning technology that scans illegal content shared in user groups

 modi sarkaar kaa pehla bajet pesh ho chukaa he or ek baat saaf he ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne isamen arthvyavastha or saarvajanik jivan ke tamaam pahaluon ko chune kii purazor koshish kii he
 He has tried to do something for the finance sector, manufacturing, employment, infrastructure, defense, farming, science, electricity, irrigation, etc
 and this budget gives a glimpse of Narendra Modi's ideology and the party's manifesto
 is
 apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan narendra modi ne jo kuch vaade kiye the or charchaaen kii thim unki thodi-thodi jhalak vitt mantri ke bhaashan main milti he
 The Finance Minister has tried to fulfill most of his wishes with his limited resources
 unhone is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa he ki khajaana khaali na hone paae
 That is, they have tried to maintain balance from all sides
 yah bahut kathin kaary tha kyonki ek ore to jidipi ke vikaas kii dar kam he or tex vasuuli bhi lakshya se kam rahi he
 He has tried to alleviate the pain of the middle class troubled by inflation by giving some tax rebate and announced to increase the personal income tax exemption limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2
5 lakh
 isse unke donon uddeshy puure ho jaaenge
 The first is that the middle class, which is their main voter, should not be let down and the second is that the government gets cheaper money in this way
 apni yojanaon ke karyanvayan ke liye sarkaar oonchi daron par dhanrashi ikatthi karti he lekin is tarah se praapt raashi kii laagat bahut kam hoti he
 He needs a large amount of money to carry out big plans
 uske is lakshya kii prapti ho jaaegi
 Keeping this in mind, the Finance Minister has not only raised the limit of investment in PPF to Rs 1
5 lakh but also returned the Kisan Vikas Patra
 yah prashansaneey he kyonki desh main bachat karne kii pravriti ghatati ja rahi he jo khatarnaak he
 The government has tried to focus on industrial progress through this budget
 iske liye saat audyogic shahar sthapit karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Not only this, it has been said that steps should also be taken for small and medium industries
 unhone khaas taur par is baat ko kaha ki bharat nivesh kaa bada kendra bane
 It is easy to do business here and for this they have given FDI in some areas including defense
 menuphaccharing sector ko badhaava dene ke liye unhone use raahat di he
 To promote technology, he has proposed to give Rs 500 crore for the National Rural Internet and Technology Mission
 isse desh main computer hardware or software nirmaan ke liye protsaahan milegaa
 The problem of housing in the country is huge and the Finance Minister has looked in that direction
 iske liye unhone na keval houseing lone par byaaj main inakam tex chhot kii seemaa badha di he balki 100 smart city kii ghoshnaa bhi kii he
 Due to these also the problem of housing will be overcome and pressure on big cities will be reduced
 inke liye unhone saat hajaar karod rupee se bhi zyada dhan kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 This is a commendable step because China has solved the housing crisis in its country by creating such cities and created new employment opportunities
 bharat main tex pranali aaj bhi jatil he or unhen saral banane ke liye jiesti or ditisi kii avadharana kii gai lekin durbhagyavash donon ke aane main baari vilamb hua
 Now the Finance Minister has clarified that GST will come into force by the end of this year
 yah na kevala vyapaariyon ke liye balki aam janata ke liye bhi phydemand hoga kyonki isse bahut si chizon ke daam ghat sakate hai
 Overall, the Finance Minister has tried to focus on more and more issues

 agar aap bhi ho rahe hai stream ko lekar kanphyus, to in tips kii madad se chune sahi stream
 
 
 What do you want to become? You must first set in your mind what subject you are interested in and what you want to become in the future
 us hisaab se arts, commers yaa science chune
 Akshay's powerful message for students, said, "do what you like, there is no future in it? Children often think that there is a good scope of future in commerce and science but not in arts
" lekin aisa katai nahin he
 Every subject has a future
 isliye apane lakshya ke liye aapako kis subject ko padhane se madad milegi, iske liye teachers yaa counslar se baat karen
 Talk to a career counselor, if you do not understand anything, then you can take the help of a career counselor
 unase baat karke dyside karen ki aapke future ke liye kau-si stream best he
 Admission is going to start in DU, know how to do online registration Do not take any stream, it is often that we take science and commerce in enthusiasm to show our friends and family
 lekin baad main feel hota he ki aap isamen acha nahin kar paa rahe hai
 So it is better to repent later than before and choose the stream
 Civil Service Exam main naa ho tension, bachaa he 1 maheenaa shuru karen revisionlogom kii naa karen paravanagar aapke 10veen main 90% marks aaen he, vahiin in nambar se aapako aasaani se science or commers mil sakati he, lekin aapkaa interest arts main he to bina logon kii parvaah kiye arts ko chune
 Because you know that the better you can do in arts, the more you will not be able to do in science and commerce stream

 com / wdklyworar — ICC (@ICC) April 23, 2015 bihar main endie sarkaar aajkal apana vot bank majboot karne main jorshor se juty hui he
 In view of the resentment among the Dalits, the Nitish government had earlier announced an incentive for only SC / ST UPSC and bpsc's Preliminary Examination (PT Exam)
 lekin ab sarkaar ne pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa varg ke abhyarthiyon ko bhi isamen shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Under this, the State Government will give an incentive of Rs 1 lakh for the candidates of backward and very backward classes like SC / ST in the state, for passing the PT of UPSC and Rs 50 thousand for passing the PT examination of BPSC
 ab keval saamaanya varg ke abhyarthi hi nitish sarkaar kii is protsaahan raashi se vanchit rahenge
 Candidates from backward classes have welcomed the government's move
 patna main in pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe chaatro ne kaha kinitishasarkaar kaa yah behad saraahneey kadam he
 Vishal Kumar, Ashish Ranjan, Ravindra Kumar and Shravan Kumar, who are preparing for BPSC, say that the government should make this amount available to the students immediately after the PT exam, so that they can do the coaching on time
 inkaa kahana he ki pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa varg ke bahut se chaatr paise ke abhaav main piti paas karne ke baad mens kii taiyaari thik se nahin kar pate hai
 Last week, the state cabinet first decided to give incentives for SC / ST students
 tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki dalit naaraaz hai or unako khush karne ke liye sarkaar ne yah faisla liya he
 Just a week after this, the government had to take the same decision for backward and very backward classes
 sarkaar ke pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa varg kalyaan vibhaag ke sachiv prem singh meena kaa kahana he ki paise ke abhaav main in virgon ke chaatr thik se pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari nahin kar pate the
 He could not get better coaching
 ab rajya sarkaar se milane vaale paison se wo koching karke behtareen taiyaari kar sakate hai
 Students have expressed happiness over this decision, but they are afraid that this decision of the government will not remain on paper only
 inaki ye bhi maang he ki paise samay par milen, taaki wo koching samay par le saken
 However, due to this decision of the government, the students of the economically backward general class are also hopeful that the government may also take care of them
 aam aadmi party kii rashtriya sadasya priti menon ne bijepi ke purv mantri ekanath khadse par sarkaar kaa ek hajaar karod rupee kaa najarana dubaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Priti Menon, addressing a press conference in Pune, accused Eknath Khadse that in order to benefit Pune's renowned builder Avinash Bhosle for fifty crores, he ordered the state government to waive one thousand crore rupees as property
 priti menonane bataaya ki pune ke vijay nagar ilaake main sarkaar ne gagetted officer ke liye takreeban 24 acre jameen rakhi thi
 The plot is near the e Square multiplex in Shivajinagar, Pune
 priti menon ne bataaya, 'ye mudda pune kii badi property kaa mudda he, jo gagetted officers ke liye sarkaar ne rakhi thi
 200 plots of Vijay Nagar will be given to the gazetted officers, those plots will be given on lease
 wo plots aage beche nahin ja sakate
 If it is to be sold, the original owners will have to take permission from the government and they will have to give 50% of the cell value to the government
 'ek NGO ne kiya ghotaale kaa bhanda phodpriti menon ne bataaya ki is property main 90 fisadi se zyada plots bik chuke hai or sarkaar ne unase najarana kabool nahin kiya he
 Priti Menon said, 'an NGO complained to the DM of Pune about the plot saying that their sighting has not been recovered
 colector ne order diya ki ye najarana vasuul karnaa chahie or uskaa jurmaana bhi vasuul karnaa chahie
 Menon said that this case is very complicated because such wrongdoing has been done, due to which other plot holders will also pretend not to give the government an excuse to buy property
 priti menon ne kaha, 'ekanath khadse ne jab is maamle kii rajasav mantri ke taur par apil suni, to unhone virodh darj karaane vaale NGO ko nahin bulaayaa or is order ko ste kar diya
 'preeti said,' The government has to lose a thousand crores because the ABIL of Avinash Bhonsle had to save fifty crores
 aam aadmi party aise bhrashtachar kii ninda karti he or hamaari maang he ki ekanath khadse kaa order radd kiya jaae or is maamle kii jaanch karai jaae
 'there is no difference between the BJP and NCP: Preeti Menonmenon said that on the one hand, BJP stands out from the ministerial position on the KJP while on the other hand they are given a clean chit
 bijepi uljhan main he ki party main bhrashtachar kaa kya kare or kya karrwai kare
 This is a big failure of BJP
 usne ek paardarshak sarkaar kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin wo vaise hi bhrashtachar main lipt he jaise ensipi kii sarkaar thi
 There is no difference between BJP and NCP
 ABIL ne priti menon ke khilaaf manahani kaa cese darj karne kii baat kahshavinaash bhonsle kii ABIL company ke managing diarector ne ek patrak jari karte hue kaha he ki sabhi aarope bebuniyaad hai or ve iske khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karaayenge
 According to ABIL company, the police has investigated the case and sent the report to the court

 In this respect, India falls into the third category
