 com / lu2wwwtnym uttar pradesh main rajdhani lakhanu sahit pradesh ke kai jilon main dispencer unit main chip lagaakar remote ke jariye tel chori kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad tel companiyon ne pehali badi karrwai karte hue paanch petrol panpon kii dilarship nirast kar di he
 This information was given by an official
 bharat petroleum karporation limited (bipisiel) ne chaar panpon ko to indian oil korporation (iosi) ne ek pump kii dilarship nirast kii he
 Companies have taken these petrol pumps into their possession
 jin panpon ko companiyon ne apane kabje main liya he, unamem do rajdhani lakhanu ke to barabanki, baharich or kannauj kaa ek-ek pump shaamil he
 The comments vahiin rajdhani ke chah panpon kaa dilarship agreement nirast kiya gaya he
 As the matter is in court, companies have not captured them
 bipisiel company ke chif manager (public relation) sundarrajan ne bataaya ki estf ne lakhanu ke saat panpon par ek saath chhapemari kar dispencer mashin main remote divaais lagaakar gadabadi karne ke khel ko pakadaa tha, jiske baad yah karrwai kii gai he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) At the same time, the dealership agreement for six pumps of Rajdhani has been canceled
 maamla court main hone kii vajah se companiyon ne inhen kabje main nahin liya he
 The action has been taken after BPCL company chief manager (public relations) Sundararajan said that the STF had raided seven pumps in Lucknow simultaneously and installed a remote device in the dispenser machine
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Jaishankar said, 'we have relations with many countries, which have a history
 ham vahi karenge jo hamaare rashtriya hit main he or us ranneetik saajhedaari kaa ek hissaa prayek desh kii kshamta or duusare ke rashtriya hit kaa sammaan karnaa he
 He said that the indo-us strategic partnership is based on deep and broad coordination
 unhone kaha ki pompio ke saath urja, vyapaar muddon, afghanistan, khadi or hind-prashanth kshetra jaise muddon par charchaa hui
 On terrorism, Jaishankar said that he has expressed appreciation for the strong support of the Trump administration
 pompio mangalvaar ko yahaan pahunche the
 He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday morning and discussed various aspects of bilateral relations
 pompio kii yah yatra america ke raashtrapati donald trump or pradhanmantri modi ke bich japan ke osaka main hone vaale ji-20 shikhar sammelan ke itar hone vaali baithak se pehle hui he
 PC Monahan, former head of the Central Statistics Commission, abruptly stepped down on 28 January
 unhone enditivi se kaha ki sarkaar ne rojgaar par NSSO (neshnal cemple survey organijeshan) kii report jari nahin kii
 They were forced to step down
 unhone daawa kiya ki ayog ko kramash: pare kiya jane laga
 He said that when the NSSO report came and we approved it on December 5, it was released
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa daawa, ki yah draft report he, galat he
 Once the commission approves the report, it is a final report
 aap yah nahin kah sakate ki yah ab sarkaar se apruve hogi
 When you use the word 'approve' it raises a question of credibility
 aane vaale mahinon main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai or NSSO kii report jaahir kar rahi he ki berogari 45 saal main sabase oonche str par he
 This has created a huge political controversy
 yah report sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par jari nahin kii he
 But this newspaper is published by Business Standard
 mohanan ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki unka istipha vyaktigat kaarnon se nahin tha jaisaa ki niti ayog ke vaais chif, rajeev kumaar ne kaha tha
 Mohanan said that "in my letter, i made it clear that i have specific examples and we felt that continuation of our services in the Commission was not going on for any purpose as the Commission was not very effective and there is nothing personal in it
" 
 sarkaar ko muddon par dhyaan dena chahie or vyavastha main sudhaar karnaa chahie
 And Meenakshi, who resigned with me, has said the same thing
 ''unhone kaha ki ayog kii pavitrataa ko banaae rakhana mahatvapurn he or niti ayog ko isamen shaamil nahin hona chahie
 This means that statistics should be kept independent of the government
 ise nishpaksh rup se prakashit kiya janaa chahie
 There are some core principles of official data that the government notified in 2016, and it has been stated very clearly that the figures must be completely independent
 ayog yah sunishchit karata he ki aisa ho
 This commission is a very important issue for its autonomy
 sankhyikeey aankadon kii vishwasaneeyata ko banaae rakhana vyavastha ke liye yah mahatvapurn he
 He said that Niti Aayog's involvement in it is not very necessary

 Hrishikesh Mukherjee is known as one of the most outstanding film directors in the Indian film industry
 unhone ghar ke chote muddon se lekar samaaj ke samvedansheel muddon par filmein banaain
 But one particular thing of Hrishikesh Mukherjee was that he always kept the mood of most of his films to be shown
 bahut dark ve kisi film ko nahin le gaye
 Because of this, even though he may not be included in the list of film directors like Satyajit Ray, Ritvik Ghatak, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, he has been a unique film director in himself
 unki doordarshee soch unki filmon main saaf najar aati thi
 Only then was he able to play Utpal Dutt's character as Bhavani Prasad in Golmaal or the character of a sick man laughing in joy, played by Rajesh Khanna
 unhone apane kism kaa cinema banaaya jiskaa karjadaar bollywood hameshaa rahegaa
 How people can be taught through comedy films, nobody has done this before Hrishikesh Mukherjee
 ye rishi da kii original style thi
 Hrishikesh Mukherjee was born on 30 September 1922 in Kolkata
 vahiin 27 agast 2006 ko mumbai main unka nidhan ho gaya
 He started his career in 1957 with the film Musafir
 film main dilip kumaar or kishor kumaar lead role main the
 At the same time, very few people will know that in 1998, he made a film called Jhooth Bole Kaua Kate
 is film kii cast main anil kapur or juhi chawla the
 This film was the last film of his career
 filmein banane ko lekar unka dedication unhen behad khaas banaata tha
 On Rishikesh Mukherjee's death anniversary, he is telling some special films made by him
 1- musafir-unki pehali hi film thi musafir or utani hi khaas bhi thi
 In this film, he made a film with many different stories
 film ko parts main banaaya gaya tha
 Made with Kamal's Thoughtprocess, the film featured Kishore Kumar, Suchitra Sen and Dilip Kumar in the lead roles
 rishi da kii pehali hi film aisi thi ki is kism kii film us samay tak bollywood main pehle kabhi nahin bani thi
 2- ashirwad-ashirwad movie was made by Rishi Da, the best film of Dada Muni i
e
 Ashok Kumar's career
 ashok kumaar kaa kairactor apane aap main ek aise insaan kii daasta bayaan karata he jo kala se paripurna hota he or atmik rup se aadhyatmik
 But due to the situation, he has to spend most of his life in jail
 film main ashok kumaar kii jarney vaaki kisi ke bhi ankhon main aasu laa sakati he

 Adorned with the acting of satyakam-dharmendra, Sharmila Tagore and Sanjeev Kumar, this film is counted among the classic films
 film main rishton ke alag alag shades dikhaae gaye hai jo vakt vakt main aapako kaaphi imotional kar dete hai
 Dharmendra did an amazing acting in this film
 4- anand-is film ko bhala koun bhul saktaa he
 This was the film that made Rajesh Khanna a superstar
 film main unka hansata kheltaa kirdaar sabhi kaa dil moh lene main kaamyaab hota he
 At the same time, this film also laid the foundation of the career of century great Amitabh Bachchan
 film timeles he or aaj kii janareshan main bhi iske dialogs kaaphi mashhoor hai
 5- This film was made by Rishi Da on the subject of guddi-bade Rare
 shaayad rishi da ke alaava aise mudde par film banane kii koi soch bhi nahin saktaa or itani khubasurat to banane se rahaa
 Rishi Da had long ago told the audience how different the truth is
 insaan kai dfa apane khyaalon main itnaa leen ho jaataa he ki use vahi sachai lagane lag jaati he
 How films are not real life and how real life is different, this was explained by Rishi Da in the film from the perspective of Nadan Guddi
 6- bawarchi-ye film ghar-parivaar ke kisse kahaniyon kaa darpan thi
 How do we sit down with each other on small matters and ignore the real beauty of relationships
 magar vakt jaanata he ki use rishton kii ahmiyat kab or kaise samjaani he
 At the same time, it is not so easy to create Rajya Khanna's Yayavari character
 ek naukar use halaat ne banaaya he yaa wo khuda kaa bheja hua ek maseehaa he jo ghar-ghar naukar banakar pahunchataa he or chhut-put man mutaav, dwesh, ishya jaise gandagiyon ko pyaar main tabdeel kar nikal jaataa he nirantar chalate rahane ke liye, khojane koi or makaan jahaan pyaar kii kami ho or jarurat bhi
 7- Arjun Pandit - Sanjeev Kumar played the lead role of Arjun Pandit in this film
 film kaa kirdaar itnaa strong tha ki isse prabhavit hue bina rahaa hi nahin ja saktaa
 Sanjeev Kumar played this role with a lot of perfection
 ek chidchide, akadu or pathar dil insaan se ve kaise ek aise insaan main badal jate hai jo gyaan ke mahaasaagar main gote laga rahaa he or ek maamuli naukar hone ke baad bhi logon ko prakashmay banane kaa kaam puri jimmedaari ke saath kar rahaa he
 This change of Arjun Pandit is heart touching
 kashmir main lagi paabandiyon se kshubdh hokar iees kii naukari chhodane vaale kannan gopinathan ne ravivaar ko kaha ki ghati ke logon ko anuchhed 370 ko lekar manaaya janaa chahie, lekin unhen vichaar prakat karne kaa mauka na die jane se aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Kannan has claimed his resignation from the job to express his views against "violation of freedom of expression" in Kashmir
 2012 batch ke adhikari gopinathan (32) us vakt surkhiyon main aae the jab unhone 2018 main kerala main ai baadh ke dauraan apni pahchaan chhipaakar swayamsevakon ke saath raahat or bachaav kaaryon main hissaa liya tha
 Gopinathan, who was Secretary in the Energy Department of the Union Territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, resigned last Wednesday
 unke tyaagptr main kashmir mudde kaa koi zikr nahin tha
 Gopinathan said on Sunday, "I want to exercise my right to freedom of expression but it was impossible for me to do so while in service
" isamen kai niyam-kaayade hote hai
 "gopinathan, a resident of Kottayam district in Kerala, said that repeal of Article 370" is the right of the elected government "but in democracy people have the right to react to such decisions
 gopinathan ne pitiai-bhashaa se kaha, "kashmir par faisla liye jane ke kareeb 20 din baad bhi vahaan logon ko is par pratikriya dene kii anumati nahin he or loktantric vyavastha main yah sweekaarya nahin he
 Personally, i could not accept it as well as continue my services at such a time
 " unhone kaha, "yah aisi cheez nahin he jise main apane desh main sweekaar kar sakuun
 i know my acceptance does not matter, but i wanted to make it clear that this is not correct
 hamen unhen abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii anumati deni chahie
 If they don't like it, we can try to explain it to them
 ham unhen band karke or or vichaar vyakt karne se rokkar nahin manaa sakate
 " aage padhane se pehle do baaten samajhie
 First thing, sometimes you feel yourself, and secondly, to whom you give more head, one day it definitely hugs
 buumarang kii khaasiyat hoti he wo palatakar waapas aata he,arvind kejariwal ne jab dilli waalon se kaha thaki koi bhi kuch bhi galat karata dikhe to aap use record kar lenaa, uskaa sting kar lenaa us vakt unhone khud nahi sochaa tha wo buumarang phenk rahe hai
 Then who knew that one day their same thing would prove to be trouble for them
 aaj log audio ricarding laa rahe hai, video ricarding dikhaa rahe hai
 Issues of the meetings - Things are being known on the phone, everyone is engaged in conducting a sting operation of the Aam Aadmi Party everywhere
 kejariwal ko khud yakeen na ho rahaa hoga ki log unki ‘record kar lenaa’ vaali baat ko itani gambhirtha se bhi le sakate hai
 Try to understand the second point, the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party have been habitual since the beginning, to give preference to the camera
 camera saamne aate hi wo zyada se zyada footage khenchne ke pher main bolnaa shuru kar dete, phir bhale camera moh main wo ye bhul jaaen ki yahi baat anna aandolan ke daur se doharaate chale aa rahe hai
 It was nice to see and hear all this on TV in the beginning, the backbone would get tickled pink, slowly i started getting bored with all these things as after a year and a half of relationship girlfriends '' and tell '' food
 Khaya Mere Babu seems to be disenchanted with the message of 'aam Aadmi is disillusioned with the talk and the love of the common party with the camera, camera love is now proving a headache, take a camera to a leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and see The panic of a sting operation is so full that their screams will disappear
 aisa nahin he ki party in jhanjhaavaton se nikalne ke raste nahin khoj rahi he, jo party kumaar vishwaas ko itane dinon tak sah sakati he, ashish khetaan ko netaa bana sakati he, wo kuch bhi kar sakati he
 Faced with sting operations, partydamage came under control, and they got the news of re-launch of Nokia 1100 in the market
 party main bache hue (bache hue kaa taatpary un netaaon se he jo aajkal khulaa khat nahin likh rahe, twitor par jhagad nahi rahe, khud koi nayaa sting nahin kar rahe or sabase khaas milon lambey blog likh duniya ko darun dukh nahi bataa rahe!) netaaon ne faisla liya he ki party main har kisi ko nokia 1100 pakadaa diya jaae, basharte bazaar main phir aane ke baad isamen kisi bhi tarah kii ricarding kii suvidha na ho
 All the leaders-mlas and activists have been instructed to submit all the gadgets equipped with recording facilities to the party offices as soon as possible
 agar kisi ke paas aisa koi yantra paaya jayega jo chhaviyaan yaa dhvaniyaan sahej saktaa ho ise party virdohi krity maan use party se nikaal diya jayega
 New guidelines for membership of Aam Aadmi Party have been issued, every worker who subscribes to the party has to declare on affidavit that he does not have any gadget that can be stinged tomorrow, come to the party Nokia 1100 will also be given along with a broom cap to every member of the family
 car kii number plate nikaali, uskaa beemaa karaane kii koshish kii or jab baat nahin bani to marammat ke bajaay marsades car ko kabadi ko bechney ke liye nikle
 
 
 But meanwhile, the police got their hands on it
 yah kahani he dilli ke pashchim vihaar ke marsades hit and ran maamle kii
 The police have arrested two accused in this case
 unke khilaaf kadi karrwai hogi
 On February 5, accused Savneet trampled the young man Atul Arora in his Mercedes car and fled from the scene
 police tabhi se usko talash rahi thi
 The story of police reaching the accused is interesting

 DMK Chief MK Stalin has been attacked by the BJP for allegedly making contradictory statements about the candidate for the post of PM
 bijepi ne kaha ki diemke pramukh stallin ne kolkata main hui mamata banerjee kii raily main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bataane se mukar gaye jisase pataa lagata he ki vah apane pehle ke rukh se hat gaye hai
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, Stalin on behalf of his party has told Congress President Rahul Gandhi who has the ability to defeat PM Narendra Modi
 iske saath hi unhone rahul gandhi ko piem pad kaa candidet bhi kaha tha
 Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilasai Sundararajan said that Stalin spoke of making Rahul Gandhi the Prime Ministerial candidate in Chennai, but he did not speak in Kolkata, such contradictions reveal the reality of the opposition front
 haalanki stallin se jab is baavat ravivaar ko poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki vah rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke apane ruukh par kaayam hai
 To this, tamilsai Sundararajan asked the question why if Stalin is firm on his stand, why did he not propose to make Rahul Gandhi the Prime Ministerial candidate at a mega rally of 22 parties in Kolkata
 in aaropon par stallin ne kaha ki unhone apni party ke kaarykram main rahul gandhi ko piem banane kaa prastaav diya tha jabaki kolkata kii raily main kai vipakshi dal shaamil the
 He said, "that was the DMK program where we had full authority and we proposed the name of Rahul Gandhi because the people of Tamil Nadu have hope and what is wrong with it
 "stallin ke mutabik kolkata main kisi bhi party ke netaa ne yah nahin kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke liye gandhi ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar galati kii he
 Let us tell you that on January 19, Stalin said that thundering on Narendra Modi government in Kolkata, the Lok Sabha election 2019 will prove to be similar to the second fight for independence
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi mamata banerjee samet kuch logon se darate hai
 At the Brigade Parade Ground, Stalin said, "the next Lok Sabha elections will be like the second battle for independence, we will stop the poison of Hindutva and radical Hinduism from spreading, our appeal is to defeat Modi and save the country
" " stallin ne centre sarkaar par corporate gharaanon ke liye kaam karne kaa aarope lagaate hue uski aalochana kii

 kashmir mudde kaa hal nikaalane ke liye america raashtrapati donald trump (donald Trump) kii madhyasthata kii peshkash se khush pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan (imran Khan) ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki donon padosiyon ke bich ke is vivaadit mudde ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 Khan's statement comes just hours after India and Pakistan offered to be a mediator on the Kashmir issue by Donald Trump
 gauratlab he ki donon netaaon ne white house main mulaakaat ke dauraan afghanistan shanti prakriya sahit vibhinn muddon par charchaa kii
 At the same time, the Government of India has rejected Trump Trump's claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has requested him to mediate on the Kashmir issue
 america kii teen din kii yatra par gaye imran khan ne trump ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya he
 Imran Khan told Fox News of America, "we will never settle (kashmir dispute) in a bilateral manner
" "ovel offis main trump ke saath pehali mulaakaat ke kuch hi ghante baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ek vakt tha jab general (parvej) musharraf or bharat ke pradhanmantri (atal bihari) vaajapeyi the, us vakt ham kashmir mudda sulajhane ke bahut kareeb aa gaye the
 But since then we are on two different poles and i really think India should talk
 america isamen badi bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 President Trump can play a really important role
 iske baad jab fox news ke ankar ne bharat kaa bayaan padhaa ki bharat kaa hameshaa se yahi rukh rahaa he ki pakistan ke saath lambit sabhi muddon ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se suljhaayaa jayega, khan ne kaha ki ham is dharti ke 1
 Talking about 30 billion people
 sochie agar yah mudda sulajh jaataa he to aman kaa alam kya hoga
 While denying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ever spoken of US mediation on Kashmir, India said on Monday that cross-border terrorism is mandatory for any kind of relationship with Pakistan
 shimla samjhauta or lahore udghoshnaa bharat-pakistan ke bich sabhi muddon ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se sulajhane kaa aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Welcoming Trump's remarks, Imran Khan said, "president, i can tell you that if you can resolve this issue by mediation right now, you will get the blessings of billions of people
" ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main khan ne kaha ki agar bharat apane parmaanu hathiyaar nasht kar de to pakistan bhi unhen khatm kar degaa
 He said yes, because nuclear war is not an option
 pakistan or bharat ke bich parmaanu yuddh kaa vichaar bhi khud ko barbaad karne vaala he kyonki hamaari simaaen dhaai hajaar mile tak aapas main judi hui hai
 Imran Khan said, "I think there is a feeling among people in the subcontinent that some incidents happened in February and there was tension again on the border
" isliye logon main aisi bhaavana he or isliye maine raashtrapati trump se poocha ki kya vah is bhoomika main aana chahenge
 The US is the most powerful country in the world, the only country that can mediate between Pakistan and India to resolve the Kashmir issue
 imran khan ne kaha ki ham pichley 70 saal se sirf or sirf kashmir ke kaaran sabhy padosiyon kii tarah nahin rah sake hai

 Rajesh's laptop was not running, so he wanted to work for a while on the computer kept in Aarushi's room

 But that did not happen that morning
 vah baar-baar ghanti or lohe ke bahari gril ko bhi baja rahi thi
 Finally, Nupur opens the wooden door with folded eyes and asks the iron grill inside, where is Hemraj? Bharti says, 'I don't know
 kya aap chaabi neeche phenk dengi?' jab vah ai to dekha ki baahar lohe kaa gril band nahin he
 But the inner grill door is locked from the outside

 He has no picture of blood-soaked footprints on the roof, where Hemraj's body was found as there was a large crowd and no pictures of blood-stained glass whiskey fingerprints match the finger prints of anyone

 There we are surprised to see that the roof has impressions of blood-stained hands, there is red water like blood in the cooler and a corpse is found rotting in the corner, there are the same marks on the head as Aarushi had on her head and both of them The larynx was also cut in the same manner

 He says, 'after being in harsh sunlight for two days in the heat of May, the body was in such a condition that even Rajesh could not identify Hemraj

 Rajesh heard voices in Aarushi's room, found Hemraj on Aarushi's bed and angrily slashed both of them with a golf stick

 But even while leaving the BSP, i swore that i would die by teaching politics to Mayawati

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Friday that the way a monitoring committee has been constituted to look into the work for the proposed Nalanda International University, it seems that the work of this university will not stop now
 bhartiya saanskrithik sambandh parishad (isisiar) kii patna main yojit ek antarrashtriya sangoshtee ko sambodhit karte hue nitish ne kaha ki ab nalanda vishvavidhyalay ke kuladhipati ke rup main arthshaastri amartya sen ko niyukt kar diya gaya he tathaa kaam kii dekharekh ke liye nigaraanee samiti kaa gathan kar diya gaya he
 In such a situation, university work will not stop now

 The Chief Minister said that the people of the Governing Board of the University had met and there was a detailed discussion in the matter
 unhone is vishvavidhyalay main skool of iconomics and management kii sthapana kii bhi maang doharaate hue kaha ki agar iske liye or jameen kii aavashyaktaa hogi to bhi rajya sarkaar madad karegi

 unhone kaha ki iske liye sarkaar jald jameen uplabdh karaayegi
 He said that the ICCR center should have already opened in Bihar
 20-21 march ko holi he, magar holi jaisi khabar aa gai he
 The use of footwear in Indian politics is rare

 We apologize for not even telling which brand the shoe was

 We did nothing but are still apologizing
 sant kabir nagar main jo gata he wo kabir kii har vaani ke khilaaf gata he
 In this incident of Sant Kabir Nagar there was neither something like Kabir nor saint like
 kuch tha to sirf juuta tha
 The first few shots of the video show the conversation taking place
 saansad sharad treepathi puch rahe hai ki ek yojana ke shilapat main unka naam kyon nahin tha
 The same thing happens between BJP MP Sharad Tripathi and BJP MLA Rakesh Singh Baghel, and Sasand Saheb says that if mlas like you were born, then MLA Baghel in response said that he will kick shoes
 bas saasand treepathi juuta nikaalkar vidhayak rakesh singh baghel par barasaane lagate hai
 In the rescue, MLA Baghel also tried to kill with hands, but like Sasand Tripathi, he could not take revenge
 saansad treepathi ne kai juute maare
 He also used the abuses which are initially mentioned by mother and sisters
 aae din soshal media par ham aisi gaaliyaan jhelte rahete hai
 Killing the mp's shoe is not merely an act of provocation
 balki uksaaya to saasand ne tha
 It was disrespectful to say to an MLA that he has created mlas like you
 vidhayak ke swabhimaan par hamalaa tha
 Another explanation of this shoe-killing incident is necessary
 juuta maarane kaa adhikaar kahaan se aata he
 Comes from the ego of that caste, which feels that even today the whole society is its birth
 usne paidaa kiye hai
 Shoe arrogance is completely racist
 ye muhaavara kahaan se aayaa or kiske liye aayaa, iskaa saamaanya adhyayan bataa degaa ki yah jativaadee ahankaar he
 At the meeting of the District Action Planning Committee, the absence of anonymity among all the officers is the coming out of the shoes, the arrogance that arises out of the arrogance of casteism
 saansad ne na sirf apni jati ke ahankaar or swaghoshit adhikaar kaa pradarshan kiya, balki vidhayika kaa bhi apmaan kiya he
 The speaker of the UP Legislative Assembly should order to take action against Sasand in honor of his MLA
 aaj hi kai akhabaaron main modi sarkaar kaa vigyaapan chapa he ki laal batti samskruti khatm kar di
 Today, a video has come from Sant Kabir Nagar in Uttar Pradesh that the red light is not finished yet
 bhartiya janata party kii rashtrawaad kii paathshaala main jahaan jatvaad ke khilaaf lacture die jate hai, us paathshaala main saasand treepathi ko ek saal ke liye bhej diya janaa chahie
 If nationalism does not affect them, then who will be
 seemaa par tanaav he or saansad vidhayak ko juuta maar rahe hai
 This scene may cause the morale of the army to fall
 philhal zila prashasan is ghatana se sabak le saktaa he
 From now on, any meeting, where mlas and mps are going to come, take off their shoes
 vidhayak or saansad ko uchit duuri par bithaaya jaae
 At least two constables must be seated between the MLA and the MP
 agar saansad ke peeche chaar samarthak khadey hon to vidhayak ke peeche bhi usee sankhya main samarthakon ke khadey hone kii ijazat honi chahie
 The MLA and MP should be written that they will not abuse if they get angry
 or kis tarah se ye khabar aap tak pahunchaae
 This is our political quality
 hansane or rone se badalegi nahin
 It is not known when from which party such scenes should come
 isliye aaj bijepi kii yah tasviir he kal kisi or kii aisi tasviir aa sakati he
 You cannot change it, then i said that you should stop wearing shoes and come to the meeting
 iskaa matlab yah nahin pistaul lekar aane kii chhot ho
 After this incident, there should be complete ban on coming with weapons
 aap shame karen, kyonki aap vahi kar sakate hai
 If Iqbal had been left in the district administration, i would have stopped running the shoe for the first time
 magar ikbaal is kadar khatm ho gaya he ki juuta chalane kaa kaam puraa hone ke baad police ke afasar aate hai or donon ko alag karte hai
 No one was able to decide on whose side action is taken when stopped
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke is vikaas kii bhi samiksha kiijie
 Ideally, Sharad Tripathi ticket should be cut
 unhen party se nikaal dena chahie or unka juuta lekar party ke daftar ke baahar rakh dena chahie ki dobaaraa iskaa kisi ne istemaal kiya to uskaa haal sharad treepathi kii tarah hoga
 If action is not taken against Sharad Tripathi, then slapping shoes will become iconic in politics
 sharad treepathi ko bhi apane paanv or dimaag se juuta nikaal dena chahie
 The shoe should be removed from the brain before the foot, because the first signal of the idea of hitting the shoe comes from the mind which is made up of the narrow rites of society
 dimaag main jab juuta hota he, tabhi haath main juuta aata he
 We all talk about kicking the shoe many times
 isse bachanaa chahie
 Neither should you tell yourself to wear shoes, nor should anyone tell you to kick shoes
 ham sab bol dete hai
 Should not speak na bolnaa chahie or na hi nikaalnaa chahie
 Neither at the crossroads nor at the crossroads
 ek udhaaharan se samajhie
 Patriarchy is not just among men, it also penetrates women
 isliye iske khilaaf ladaai purushon ke saath saath auraton ko bhi ladani padati he
 Likewise, we all need to fight against this feudal and racist language of slipper

 Secret file of Rafael case has been stolen from Ministry of Defense
 siriyasli
 The secret file of the Ministry of Defense has been stolen
 wo bhi raksha mantralay se chori hui he
 Nobody would have thought that Rafael would reach this point by going through different types of turns
 sarkaar jis file ko sikret bataa kar duniya ko nahin bataa rahi thi, usee sikret file kii raksha nahin kar saki or wo chori ho gai
 really
 sarkaar ne yah baat supreme court main kahi he
 The opposition can ask for the resignation only from the secret file, because the morale of the army may fall if they demand resignation from the government
 file hi istipha dekar vayusena ke manobal ko bachaa sakati he
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava said that a review petition in the Rafale case was being heard on the bench of three judges in the Supreme Court
 prashanth bhushan hindu akhbaar main chhapi en ram kii report ke aadhaar par atirikt halafanama dena chaahate the jise court ne lene se manaa kar diya

 These are confidential documents and cannot be made public
 is par supreme court ke chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kya karrwai kii, 8 farvari ko report chhapi he to atarni general ne kaha ki pataa karke bataata hum
 Then when the hearing started again, he said that a former employee of the Ministry of Defense or current employee has committed theft, it is being investigated
 justise joseph ne poocha ki agar rafel saude main bhrashtachar kiya gaya he to kya sarkaar offisial sikret act ke peeche sharan le sakati he? nahin
 The Attorney General, we are investigating, is a criminal case, against the Official Secret Act
 justise ke em joseph- maan lijie bada aparaadh hua he to kya aap rashtriya suraksha kii aad main bachaav karenge? justise keem joseph- aapke tark ke hisaab se to boforce cese main bhi criminal court ko koi dastauez nahin miltaa
 Should this case be closed? Attorney General- Every sentence of Supreme Court can be used to destabilize
 prashanth bhushan ne sawaal kiya ki itane gambhir masale par kisi thane main exiaar nahin hui he
 Remind you that the first report in The Hindu by n Ram in the Rafale case first came on 18 January 2019
 bataaya tha ki modi raaj main 36 raphaalon kii keemat 41 pratishat adhik thi
 The second report came on 8 February 2019

 Hindu newspaper journalist n Ram said that even if you say the document of theft, we do not mind

 These documents say a lot in themselves
 supreme court main jo bahes chal rahi he us par antim faisla nahin aayaa he
 The decision of the Supreme Court came on 14 December 2018

 There was a dispute regarding the CAG report in that order

 This will cause a huge loss to the country
 venugopal ne kaha ki hindu akhbaar ke khilaaf oficial sikret act ke tahat karrwai honi, chahie magar supreme court ne is par kuch nahin kaha

 Gehlot claimed that both seemed losers and Modi would surely be defeated in the election

 In such a situation, the people of a village in Gaya district have decided to stop the hookah-water not only for the sellers of liquor but also the drinkers

 This year, this festival of friendship will be celebrated on 4 August

 Friendship is not a discovery, friendship is not with anyone everyday, do not consider our presence in your life to be unnecessary, because eyelids are never a burden on the eyes
 
 Happy Friendship Day- a spark is not less than fire, simplicity is not less than makeup, it is just a difference of thinking, otherwise friendship is also not less than love
 
 Happy Friendship Day- Why friends help with difficulties, why friends divide gum, nor the relationship of blood is tied to the custom, yet they support friends for life
 
 Happy Friendship Day- i am not changed by a friend, even if there are millions of people, they change to God
 If a wish is not fulfilled, then Happy Friendship Day- Maybe you get that fortune again
 May be those old friends again on the bench

 Bangladesh has not only made structural changes with manufacturing and export-based production (GDP) and growth in employment, but it has also achieved significant increases in social indicators, income levels and entrepreneurship levels in rural areas
 inamen laghu vitt sansthaaon (MFI) kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 a 2014 study by the World Bank, which looked at the long-term impact of micro credit programs, concluded that these programs helped rural households earn more and consume more
 yahi nahin, 2000 se 2010 ke dashak main kul garibi main 10 fisadi se zyada kami karne main iskaa yogadan rahaa he
 This has helped Bangladesh from increasing income inequality which is seen in many developing countries
 bangladesh ne kaise kiya kamalbangladesh main microfinance yani laghu vitt kii sansthaaen 1970 ke dashak main shuru huin jinamein gramin bank or BRAC (purv naam bangladesh rural advance kamity) ne prabhavi bhoomika nibhaai
 In 2006, Grameen Bank and its founder, Mohammad Yunus, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts towards the economic and social development of low-income people through small loan programs
 baad main is abhiyaan main association of soshal advancement (ASA) jaisi anya sansthaaen bhi shaamil ho gayi or gramin saamaajik evam aarthik paridrishy puri tarah se badal gaya
 a 2008 paper by the Singapore Management University highlights how institutions like Grameen Bank and BRAC have done this feat
 iske mutabik younus ne bina kuch jamaanat liye or kam se kam diphalt main karj or udhari dene kaa ek swat: tikaoo system viksit kiya, jisamen ausatan 97 fisadi kaa karj bhugtan yani reepement rate tha
 He laid special emphasis on rural women and organized them to take collective responsibility for business
 isamen acchhee baat yah thi ki jaruri nahin ki judane vaala har sadsy karj hi le, kai apane atirikt dhan ko jamaa bhi karte the
 Yunus Ahmed's important landlord has created a number of business ventures on the basis of such funds, with a profit or no-profit social mission, from knitwear (clothing weaving) to software
 unke prayaason se, ‘bangladesh ke gramin ilaakon main udhyamita kii lahar chal padi, jisane bangladesh kii gramin arthvyavastha ke dhaanche ko badalane main prabhavi tareeke se madad kii
 Not only this, the legendary telecom company Grameenphone started by Yunus brought a communication revolution in rural Bangladesh
 isi tarah, BRAC ne bhi gramin bangladesh ko badalane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 This institution, founded by Magsaysay Award winner Fazl Hasan Abid, also reconstructed even the remotest villages where government assistance was not available even in the matter of health
 isaki vajah se shishu mrityu dar main kaaphi kami ai
 Abid also funded and established several enterprises through which sericulture, dairy, hatchery and other businesses are being carried out
 inase gramin garibon ke liye rojgaar tathaa aay kaa srijan ho rahaa he
 Professor Salim Rehan of Dhaka University said that more than 75 percent of microfinance institutions are engaged in social development programs with the main emphasis on education, health, water and sanitation, women empowerment and economic development
 bharat main kyon nahin ho paaya badlaavato sawaal uthta he ki bharat main bade paimaane par microfinance sansthaaon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood yahaan aisa badlaav kyon nahin ho paaya?yah jigyaasa ek adhyayan kii maang karti he
 Professor Nisha Taneja of ICRIER says that the way these institutions are connected at the ground level in Bangladesh, winning people's trust and discouraging default is extraordinary
 ise bharat main bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he, lekin iske liye kaaphi drushti or patibaddhta kii jarurat he
 Women empowerment and social change Women have been the focal point in the work of Bangladesh's micro-finance institutions
 bangladesh kii aarthik tarakkee kii vyakhya karte hue professor kowshik basu ne is pahalu ko rekhaankit kiya
 He writes that since the inception of micro finance institutions like Grameen Bank and BRAC and the recent government-initiated work, Bangladesh has made significant progress in educating girls, giving women a better voice in families and in the public Is received
 world bank kii saal 2019 kii ek study main kaha gaya he ki bangladesh ne langik samanta ke kai pahaluon main mahatvapurn safalataa hasil kii he, jisase mahilaon or ladakiyon ke liye jivan ke har kshetra main avasar taiyaar hue hai-prajnan dar main kami ai he, skulon main langik samanta badi he or pichley ek dashak main kapadaa kshetra main lakhon mahilaon ke kaam karne kaa rasta khulaa he
 The effect of all this is that today there is a better chance for girls to complete school education and live for 60 years than boys
 isamen aage kaha gaya he ki 15 saal or usase upar kii mahilaon ke liye shram bhagidaari dar (FLFP) saal 2003 ke 26 fisadi se badhkar 2016 main 36 fisadi ho gai he
 In contrast, this rate has declined in most other countries of South Asia
 udhaaharan ke liye yuandipi ke 2018 ke apadated human deveopment indices and indicators ke anusaar, saal 2017 main bharat main FLFP dar 27
 It was 2 percent, while in Bangladesh it was 33 percent
 bangladesh kirashtriya sansad main mahilaon kii hissedari bhi badi he(vahaan 50 seat mahilaon ke liye arakshit he) or yah saal 2017 ke 19
 20 against the regional average of 4 per cent
 3 fisadi thi
 Representation of women in the Indian Parliament that year 11
 6 fisadi hi tha
 Now more women own land in Bangladesh and have more economic control over farms, livestock, houses, non-agricultural land
 world bank kii report main kaha gaya he, 'ab mahilaon ke sampatti ke swami hone ke maamle main samaaj kaa ravaiya badla he, jo ki mahilaon ke aage badhane ke liye shubh lakshan he
 'the rationale behind this is that economic empowerment of women reduces poverty, as they spend more on children and communities
 yah sab vahaan swasthya or anya suchakaankon main sudhaar se saaf dikh rahaa he
 According to UNDP 2018 report, life expectancy rate in Bangladesh is 72
 8 he jo ki bharat ke 68
 Better than 8 (in the year 2017)
 isi prakaar bangladesh main navjaat mrity dar (5 saal se kam, prati hajaar, saal 2016) 34
 2, while in India it is 43
 yahaan tak ki shiksha ke pramukh suchakaankon main bhi bharat se bangladesh aage he
 Since the Global Hunger Index (GHI) intensity report was released in October, Bangladesh is consistently in a better position than India
 is report main bangladesh ko 25
 Has secured 8 points (88th rank out of 117 countries), while India has 30 points
 3 rahaa (102veen ranking) he
 GHI measures the level of hunger and malnutrition in a country on a scale of 0 to 100
 kisi desh ko isamen jitna kam ank miltaa he, uskaa matlab he ki vahaan bhukh or kuposhan kii tivrata utani hi kam hoti he
 However, both Bangladesh and India continue to be in the 'severe' category
 neeche die gaye graph se pataa chalata he ki saal 2000 se ab tak GHI ank main bharat or bangladesh kii sthati kya rahi he
 Another important report has come in the last October itself - World Bank's first Human Capital Index (HCI) and in this too Bangladesh has surpassed India
 is index ke dwaara agali peedi ke kamgaaron kii utpaadakta ko purna shiksha or purna swasthya ke benchmark kii tulana main dekha jaataa he
 An economy in which an average worker gets full health and full education gets 1 point
 haalanki, yah koi chakit karne vaali baat nahin he, kyonki bangladesh ne apane saamaajik kshetra ke vikaas (shiksha, swasthya, khel or mahila kalyaan aadi) ke liye kaaphi sansaadhan jhonk die hai
 4 of its GDP in FY 2010
 4 fisadi se badhkar vitt varsh 2019 main 9
 8 percent
 pravaasiyon dwaara bheje jane vaala dhan bana vikaas kaa mukhya vaahakabangladesh kii arthvyavastha ke vikaas kii ek or mukhya vaahak he videsh main karyrat bangladeshi pravaasiyon dwaara bheja jane vaala dhan
 4 of this FY 2006
 8 arab dollar ke mukaable vitt varsh 2018 main 15 arab dollar tak pahunch gaya he
 It has remained above 5 per cent of Bangladesh's GDP for the past several years
 graph main jo vitt varsh 2019 main thodi kami dikh rahi he, vah is vajah se kyonki aankade march 2019 tak ke hi hai, jabaki vahaan kaa vitt varsh 30 june, 2019 tak hota he
 Professor Rahan says that the last four decades in Bangladesh have seen a significant increase in remittances sent by Bangladeshi migrants working abroad
 ab yah kai duusari tarah ke videshi mudra antarpravaah (inflow) se bhi zyada ho gaya he khaskar aadhikarik vikaas sahaayta or niryaat se hone vaali shuddh aay se
 Bangladeshi expatriates working abroad send these funds
 ye khaskar madhya purv, america, euke evam anya europea deshon or asian deshon main rahete hai
 This has ensured stability in Bangladesh's balance of payments, which in turn has helped Bangladesh keep its foreign exchange reserves healthy

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has targeted the Congress on the pretext of an Indian Air Force air strike in Balakot, Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki congress ke bayanon se desh ke rashtriya hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaa he or pakistan ko bharat ko apamaanit karne kaa mauka diya he
 Let me tell you that within a few days of India's airstrikes in Balakot, 21 opposition parties led by the Congress passed a resolution, accusing PM Modi of politicizing the incidents of Pulwama and Balakot
 jetali ne blog likhakar kaha ki balakot main bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke baad vipakshi dalon ne jis tarah kaa bayaan diya he usase bharat ke hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 They are reassuring and playing Pakistan in their hands by showing disbelief in India's action against terrorism
 unhone kaha ki aise maukon par to desh ko ek swar main baat kerani chahie jaisaa ki 1971 ke yuddh ke samay atal bihari vaajapeyi or jansangh ne kiya tha
 Jaitley termed the resolution passed by 21 parties of the opposition as unfair and said that it has given strength to the enemy country and Pakistan's media has used his statements diligently
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne do baar vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ko vishwaas main liya
 Regarding the statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Finance Minister said that 'I was most disappointed by the brief but extremely objectionable statement of former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh
 kya kaha tha manmohan singh nepulawama hamale ke baad bharat-pakistan ke bich seemaa par jari tanaav ke bich manmohan singh ne kaha tha garibi hamaare desh kii sabase badi samasya he or hamen gambhir beemaari or samasyaon se nijaat paanaa hoga
 Hopefully, both countries will return to the path of economic progress, showing their problems with understanding
 is bayaan ke baad manmohan singh ko bijepi ne nishane par liya tha
 Arun Jaitley expressed surprise that terrorism was not even condemned in the speech of the former Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki congress nit upie ne 2004 se 2014 tak kharaab sarkaar chalaai
 He remained in the role of a worse opposition till 2014-19

 Statistics show that 368 paramilitary personnel committed suicide from 2011 to 2014
 janvari 2014 yani ek maheene main hi 15 javaanon ke aatmahatya karne ke maamle saamne aae hai, lekin yadi in teen saalon main kaam ke dauraan jaan dene vaale javaanon kii sankhya par najar daalen to bada jhatka lagata he
 During this period, 371 paramilitary force personnel along with state police personnel were killed
 aapako bataa den ki deshbhar main paramilitary ke lagbhag 13 lakh jawan kaam kar rahe hai or army ke javaanon kii sankhya inase kai guna zyada he, lekin is dauraan army ke 265 javaanon ke aatmahatya ke maamle saamne aae hai
 Many top officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs themselves believe that the situation of paramilitary soldiers is much worse than army personnel
 niyam ke anusaar army ke javaanon ko teen saal border yaa jang main ladane ke baad ghar ke aasapaas kii posting mil jaati he, jabik paramilitary ke javaanon par ye niyam nau saal baad lagu hote hai
 The paramilitary force has to stay away from home for a long period of time with less leave, which leads to a lot of frustration in them
 ritair siarpief sahaayak commandend ram yadav bataate hai ki bahut si naksal, aatankwaadi kshetron main posting main family bhi saath nahin rah sakati
 In many places, the family is not well established
 iske saath main unhen chhutiyaan tak nahin milti
 One has to stay away from home for years
 ritair biguef, commandent el aar yadav bataate hai ki family saath rakhni ho to unke liye naa ajukeshan naa health vyavastha he
 Apart from CRPF, BSF, Assam Rifles NSG, nearly 13 lakh soldiers involved in many force paramilitary forces are fighting their lives every moment, every watch to create complete peace and peace within the country, but someone who takes care of them No
 ye ek traasadee nahin to kya hai
 The trailer of Bollywood star Akshay Kumar's famous film Good News has been released at the box office on Monday
 trailor ko soshal media par kaaphi acha riection mila he or ye teji se viral ho gaya he
 However, after the release of the trailer and poster of the film, one of the questions that most people were getting into was that why the spelling of the news has been written wrongly in the title of the film? But not Good Newwz
 film ke trailor launch event main ek yujar ne produsar karan johar se ye sawaal puch liya ki aapane kaha tha ki film ke naam kii galat spelink ke peeche ek kahani he
 Would you like to tell something about that story? iske jawaab main karan johar ne bataaya ki dekhie creative duniya main filmon ke naam ko kisi vishesh akshar se shuru karne ke bare main andhvishwaas rahata he
 Karan told that he too was caught in similar superstitions and used to start his films with K
 phir kuch filmein aisi relies huin jinka naam k se tha or usamenkarina kapoorbhi thim lekin baavjood iske film box offis par acchhee nahin chalin
 After this, Karan decided that perhaps all these things are just a product of his mind and there is no reality in it
 karan johar ne bataaya ki vah kaaphi saalon baad raaj mehta se mili jo ki har ek cheez ko lekar kaaphi pagal se hai
 He told that Raj, together with the film's music curator Azim Dayani, asked if they could name the film a Good News
 jawaab main karan johar ne unhen kaha ki ye galat english hogi
 After this, directors Raj and Azim came up with a new idea and said that it is named Good Newwz
 View this post on Instagraminfact even some of the good movies don't even last for two days
 You try changing any number of spellings and venues but your bad time takes you down
 # Karanjohar changed the spelling of his film and even did the trailer at Fun Cinemas and not his regular Juhu PVR which was his lucky venue for all these years
 But he need not worry as he has # akshaykumar as that man is the current Harry Potter along with # ayushmankhurana of the box office
 # numerology # superstition # viralbhayani @viralbhayania post shared byviral Bhayani(@viralbhayani) onnov 18, 2019 at 1:40am pstisalie badali film ke naam kii ssailing-karan johar ne bataaya ki unhone bhi sochaa ki agar kal ko kuch galat ho gaya to ye sabhi milakar mere upar sab kuch madh denge isliye maine kaha ki thik he aap ssailing badal dijie
 Karan told that although it is ridiculous, but he has created such a spelling which has been accepted by everyone, so i have no problem
 ajay devgan kii superhit film 'singhm' kaa rimek banane ja rahaa he
 Directed by Rohit Shetty, the film was a huge success at the box office

 twitter
 com / pnfmpf1yhg — Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) April 2, 2018 Explain that the film was already made in Telugu and Tamil
 iske baad rohit shetty ne ise hindi main banaaya tha
 The film did a decent amount at the box office and people liked Ajay Devgan's style in his police uniform
 box offis ke 'singhm' hai ajay devgan, pichhali 5 filmon ne kamaaye hai 509 karodfilm ke is rimek varjan main punjabi abhinayta ''parmish verma'' mukhya bhoomika main najar aaenge
 The film will be released next year
 abhinayta ajay devgan ne somvaar ko apane janmdin ke maukey par ye ghoshnaa kii
 Ajay shared this information to the people through a tweet
 parmish ek abhinayta ke saath-saath kaaphi mashhoor gayak bhi hai
 On the announcement of the film, Parmish wrote on his Instagram page, "it is a great honor for me that i am getting a chance to play the character of Singham in the Punjabi remake of the hit film South and Bollywood
" main vaaheguru kaa shukriya adaa karata hum

 film ne joardaar kamai kii he or saal kii badi superhit filmon main shumaar ho chuki he
 When questions on manhood arise, men resort to lies
 haal main hui ek study se pataa chalaa he ki mardaangi kii baat hone par purush apane kad or sexual partner ko lekar jhooth bolne se parhez nahin karte hai
 In this very interesting study, an experiment was conducted on some men and they were told that they have done very poorly in the strength performance
 aise main khud ko behatar sabit karne ke liye unhone apane lambey kad kaa hawala diya or apane sexual partner ko lekar bhi jhooth kaha
 He tried to prove how romantic he was with his former partners
 itnaa hi nahin apni mardaangi ko sabit karne ke liye unhone baaten bhi waisi hi kin
 On the other hand, men whose manhood is not questioned, they avoid doing such things
 psychologists maanate hai ki agar ek baar kisi purush kii mardaangi par sawaal khadey kar die jaaen to wo ise sabit karne main jute jaataa he
 Even in his words and antics, he tries to prove it
 100 logon par hui is study main sabase pehlein purushonko kaha gaya ki unki strength auron kii tulana main kam he
 He was then asked some questions, to which he gave false answers
 unhone apane kad ko chaar se paanch inch badhaakar bataaya or ye bhi kaha ki isse pehle unke kai partner rah chuke hai
 Which was much more than the actual number
 is study se judi ek baat ye bhi he ki jin gharon main purush kam padhe-likhe hote hai or mahilaayein ghar kaa kharchaa chalaati hai, un gharon main purush zyada hinsak hote hai
 By doing this, they try to prove their masculinity
 vahiin ek duusari study main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aadmi aamtaur par science yaa ejineering ko hi profeshan ke taur par dekhte hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki ve aankadon ke maamle main mahilaon se behatar hai
 North Korea said today that it will send cheerleaders to South Korea during the upcoming Asian Games

 North Korea announced in May that it would send a team to the Incheon Asian Games, despite joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States

 The case of another potentially fatal attack on an Indian in Australia came to light today when the body found in Southern Australia was identified as an Indian
 yah maamla aise samay saamne aayaa he jab donon deshon ke adhikari yahaan hui ek bhartiya kii hatya ke baad tanaav ghataane ke liye mulaakaat kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Police said the body, found in New South Wales, Australia, last week belonged to a 25-year-old Indian who was partially burnt
 yah ghatana kisi bhartiya ko maare jane kii duusari ghatana ho sakati he
 The body was found lying on the roadside near Giffin on 29 December
 haalanki shav kii abhi aupchaarik pahchaan honi baaki he
 New South Wales Police said in a statement that Australian officials are in contact with the family of the youth in India and the Indian Embassy to help in identification
 yah duusari ghatana aise samay dekhne ko mili he jab ravivaar ko melbern main 21 varshiya bhartiya yuvak kii hatya kar di gai thi
 This was the first case in which an Indian was killed in the continuous attacks on the Indian community in Australia
 bharat kii taraf se is par tikhi pratikriya hui
 Pakistan acknowledged for the first time the presence of Dawood Ibrahim, one of India's most wanted terrorists, but said that he had been pushed out of the country and could be in the United Arab Emirates (dubai)
 bharat se sambandh behatar banane ke liye pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke vishesh doot shehryaar khan ne kaha, ‘daaud pakistan main tha lekin meraa maananaa he ki use pakistan se baahar khaded diya gaya he
 If he is in Pakistan, he will be found and arrested
 ham is tarah ke gangestaron ko apane desh se gatividhiyaan chalaane nahin de sakate
 Prior to a book release event organized by the Indian Journalists Association here, the former diplomat while speaking to the media insisted that if Dawood had been in his country, he would have been arrested by now
 khan ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki daaud sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) main he
 The Nawaz Sharif government is in favor of taking action against criminals who are affecting not only Pakistan, but also other countries whether it is India or Afghanistan or any other country
 ham desh main aparaadhiyon ko phoolate falte nahin dekh sakate
 If they come to us, we will take action
 yahi vajah he ki mujhe lagata he ki vah (daaud) pakistan chhod chukaa he
 The former Pakistan Foreign Secretary also reiterated the promise of the newly elected government of Pakistan to hold talks with moderate elements of the Taliban
 unhone kaha ki pakistan narampanthi taliban ke saath vaarta karne ke paksh main he lekin kaaphi sankhya main taliban narampanthi nahin he
 Those operating in Pakistan are not moderates
 haalanki, pakistan upyukt logon ke saath vaarta ke liye taiyaar rahegaa

 If the party seems to be the most excited between the ruckus and accusations in the Aam Aadmi Party, then it is the BJP
 kaaran he aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan ne bijepi ko na sirf dilli main phir se apni khoi jameen hasil karne kaa mauka de diya he balki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav vaale rajyon main aam aadmi party kii sambhaavnaaon ko bhi dhumil kar diya he
 After the victory in the recent MCD elections, the BJP is excited anyway and now the campaign to win Delhi in the next assembly elections can get a boost

 But now the party's prospects in Gujarat may get a major setback after allegations of taking cash on themselves
 iske alaava gujarat main aam aadmi party ko ek ummid patidaar andolan ke netaa hardik patel se bhi thi lekin hardik ab shivasena ke saath hai
 This is a double blow to the Aam Aadmi Party in the state

 After fighting elections in Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party is also eyeing Himachal Pradesh where elections are due this year

 In Rajasthan, when Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas was angry at the party, he has been made in charge of Rajasthan

 Now the challenges will be less for the BJP due to the ruckus in the AAP

 After initial efforts to make corruption an issue in Maharashtra over the case of Maharashtra Nitin Gadkari companies, the Aam Aadmi Party is now struggling with its own arrogance
 maharashtra main party ke shuruaati sadasyon main shaamil anjali damania or mayank gandhi jaise log ab kejariwal ke netritv ke khilaaf khadey dikhte hai
 In such a situation, the difficulties will be less for BJP in times to come
 5
 In Punjab, Punjab may have lost the Akali Dal, an ally of the BJP, but if the BJP wants to carve out a place for itself in the future, it can benefit from the fierce fighting in the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress ab rajya kii satta main he or aam aadmi party 20 siten jitkar vipaksh main khadi he lekin aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan main punjab AAP unit bhi banty hui najar aa rahi he
 Taking command from Ghughi, now Bhagwant Mann has been given
 isse pehle ghughghi ke netritv main 20 vidhayakon ne kumaar vishwaas ke paksh main chitthee likhi thi

 board ke adhyaksh jufar faruki ne kaha ki vah court ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hai or board kaa is faisle ko chunauti dene kaa koi vichaar nahin he

 " The Naxalites announced on Wednesday that it was decided to leave Hikka's villagers and the Maoists after an apology in the Jan Adalat
 naksaliyon ne koraput jile ke lakshmipur ke vidhayak hikaaka kaa 24 march ko apharan kar liya tha
 The comments sthaneey tivi channelon par 'aruna' naam kii naksaliyon kii netaa ke prasaarit audio sandesh main kaha gaya ki vidhayak dwaara vidhansabha evam party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha dene kaa vaada karne ke baad yah nirnay somvaar evam mangalvaar ko yojit jan adaalat main liya gaya

 naksaliyon ne vidhayak ko chhodane ke badale chaasi mulia adivasee sangh (siemes) ke sadasyon kii rihaai kii maang kii thi
 The state government also agreed to release 25 of them but the Naxalites turned down the proposal
 naksaliyon ke ek netaa ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki ve siemes ke sabhi sadasyon kii rihaai chaahate hai
 Although neither the Naxalites told how many members of the CMS are in jail nor the government was willing to give this number
 naksaliyon ne buudhvaar ko ghoshnaa kii thi ki jan adaalat main hikaaka ke graminon evam naksaliyon se maafee maangane ke baad unhen chhodane kaa nirnay liya gaya

 jharkhand main railway crossing par train or belero kii takkar, 13 logon kii mautatamam daavon ke baavjood desh main railway jharkhand ke crossings par haadase thamane kaa naam nahin le rahe
 a similar tragic accident took place in Jharkhand's Ramgarh district on Tuesday morning in which at least 13 people died
 aaj kavi evam aalochak mrityunjay kaa janmdin he
 Rajkamal Prakashan has published his book 'the Process of Canon Creation in Hindi Criticism'
 vaise to mrityunjay apni kavitaaon ke liye bhi khaase mashhoor rahe hai, par aalochana kii unki yah kitaab apane aap main bahut hi shandaar kitaab he
 In this book he has discussed in detail the process of forging patterns in Hindi literature
 is kitaab kahati he ki hindi aalochana main canan-nirmaan kii prakriya itihaas kii bahason se gahare rachi-basii he
 Almost every critic has commented on his time-society
 ye tippaniyan kabhi sidhi raajnneetik hai to kabhi ve aalochana ke bich se jhaankati hai
 The relationship between the ongoing Renaissance and the emergence of Hindi criticism in our society is very dense
 hamaare raashtra-nirmaan kii prakriya se canan-nirmaan kii prakriya kaa bahut dur tak sambandh he
 As the country was becoming, so too were the canons of criticism and their bases changing
 
 
 
 The post-canon-making process of its criticism was dynamic on the axis of support and opposition to Marxism
 
 
 
 Right now, identity-discussion, women and Dalit discourse are important in terms of canon-making in Hindi criticism
 inase jude aalochak puraane cananon or unke nirmaan kii prakriyaaon par prashnchihn laga rahe hai
 In this book, the etymology of the canon, the history, the discourse on the canon in Western criticism, and then in Hindi criticism, through the mishra-bandhu, Ramchandra Shukla, Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Ramvilas Sharma, Muktibodh, Namvar Singh and Nirmal Verma
 An attempt has been made to understand the canon-making process up to the discourse of Asmita
 pustak anshah hindi aalochana main canan nirmaan kii prakriyaaacharya hajaari prasad dvivedi kii aalochana or itihaas kii lagbhag sari mahatvapurn pustaken san 1940 ke aas-paas ain
 Namvar Singh in his book 'discovery of the Second Tradition' has characterized the natural fun and funkiness of this decade and the next 50s as a basis for Dwivedi ji's overall creations and his creations
 dvivedi ji ke kabir is fakkadpan se las hai
 His 'kutj', 'ashoka's flowers' - all are companions of this common fakpapan
 par 'masti ke kaviyon’ kii baat chhod di jaae or bahes dvivedi ji par kendrit kii jaae to yah prashn mahatvapurn ho uthta he ki is fakkadpan ko banane main koun si aadharbhumi kaam kar rahi thi?dvivedi ji ke fakkadpan ko vyakhyayit karte hue namvar ji ne 'duusari parampara kii khoj’ main likhaa- ''vastut: beesvin sadi ke chauthe dashak main vidroh fakkadpan ke hi kisi-na-kisi rup ko lekar prakat hua tha
 One form of this is in Nirala's 'kukermutta' [1940], and the other form is in the story of Rahul Sankrityayan's 'volga Se Ganga' [1942]
 
 
 
 According to historians, this period was a period of great turmoil and churn
 gandhiyug ke adarshavaad kaa dhaancha jivan ke har kshetra main charmara uthaa tha
 Many political and moral ideals had become suspicious
 yah vahi kaal he jab marks or frid donon ke vichaar ek saath bharat ke shikshit madhyavarg ko prabhavit or andolit kar rahe the
 Due to the impact of the Second World War on the economic side of normal life, the feeling of insecurity was further increased
 hindu-muslim ekta kii samasya bhi swadhinata sangram ke sandarbh main or ugr ho uthi thi
 "the analysis that Namvar ji has done through historians needs to be expanded further because to see Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, it is necessary to look at the pre-40s era
 us daur ke pramukh prashnon main he- hindu-muslim sawaal, jo ki raajnneetik rup se bahut taqatvar ho chukaa tha
 This question had deepened since the 30s, with the demand for separate electorates in roundtable conferences
 40 tak aate-aate hindu mahasabha or muslim lig adhik swytt shaktiyaan banakar ubhari thim
 a bloody form of this process comes to us only seven years after 1940 in the form of divisions, riots and horrific human tragedies; That is, at a time when Acharya Dwivedi was emphasizing on the impurity of Indian culture, at the same time the crop of 'cultural purity' was blooming on the political table of the Indian colony
 hajaari prasad dvivedi apni tarah se isse lard rahe the
 By 1940, the Renaissance had lost its intellectual heat and the Arya Samaj was also no longer the Arya Samaj
 tab aise main swadhinata-prapti ke liye jujhate raashtra ke saamne is prashn kaa hal nikaalane kii chunauti thi
 Here the mention of Pakistani [then Indian] writer Mumtaz Shah Nawaz would not be unreasonable
 1943 se 1948 ke bich unhone ek upanyaas likhaa- 'da heart divided’
 Here he has marked the cultural cracks in the then hindu-muslim relations
 unke upanyaas ke paatro kii baatcheet 30-40 ke maahaul ke antarvirodhon ko or adhik gatishiltaa va gaharaai main ubharti he- ''ek noujvaan ne kaha, 'congress ke shashan main jindagi naammumkin ho gai he
 We cannot live like this
 jad se hi kuch karnaa hoga
 Things are getting worse every day
 
 
 
 Not only this, our children are forced to give up all the symbols of their religion and culture
 unhen abhivadan ke hamaare puraane tareeke 'assalaam-o-alaayakum’ kii bajaay 'vande maataram’ gaanaa padataa he
 '
 
 
 urdu kii jagah hindi ne le lee, logon ko gumraah karne ke liye 'hindustani’ naam kii cheez chalaai ja rahi he
 Herf of Arabic and Persian are also being excluded from that
 shaayad sabase kharaab baat taarikh kii kitabon main badlaav kaa tarika he
 Muslim kings and emperors are being shown unfairly
 
 
 ’‘yahaan sandarbh gandhi kii wardha yojana kaa he, jisamen praarambhik kakshaon kii shiksha ke liye gandhi ne ek yojana banaai thi
 But by then the rift between Hindu and Muslim communities had increased so much that they mostly mistrusted each other
 navaj kaa upanyaas hamen isi kii baangi dikhaata he
 The concrete perspective of the hindu-muslim problem that Namvar Ji is referring to around 40 is present in Mumtaz Shah Nawaz's novel
 bhartiya itihaas ko najadik se padhate hue ham dekhte hai ki 40 ke dashak ke shuru main hi saanskrithik shuddhta kii raajnneeti madhyavarg main lokapriy ho rahi thi
 Debates in the middle class of Hindu and Muslim communities about jobs, language and British partisanship were expressing themselves as political power
 lagbhag yahi vah samay he jahaan gandhi, bhartiya raajnneeti main 'bharat chodo’ kaa naaraa dene ke baavjood manch se baahar ho jate hai
 The center of Indian politics starts revolving around Nehru in Congress
 swadhinata andolan kii ek puri peedi kaa yah samaapan he
 Now the middle class came forward to share power
 aadarshon kaa avagunthan hat rahaa tha or hindu-muslim samasya bhi apane ko theth aadhunik rup main abhivyakt kar rahi thi–arthath rajasatta main hissedari kaa sawaal
 Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi chose Kabir in his canon
 tab tak saahitiyik paridrishy par kabir kendriya kavi ke rup main nahin sthapit the
 Earlier there were some sporadic works on Kabir in Hindi, but these works were not able to establish Kabir in the canon of poetry
 ham dekh chuke hai ki kabir ko mishrabandhuon ne apane navratna main shuruyaat main jagah nahin di thi
 Kabir's personality and work remained a challenge to critics and well-wishers
 haalanki isi samay rabindranath tagore or kshitimohan sen ke prayaason se kabir kii ek duusari pahchaan kii ja rahi thi
 In the 40th edition of his 'history of Hindi Literature', Acharya Ramchandra Shukla believed that Kabir handled the people who were void of love and devotion by chance and- "with this, following the common sense of mankind, the lower class He evoked a sense of self-esteem in the public
 
 
 ’’ par abhi bhi kabir canan main shaamil nahin hue
 The Allies also gave him a place in the later version, but even this there was no major reshuffle in the canon-making process
 kabir, hajaari prasad dvivedi ke liye samskruti kii duusari dhara se judate hai
 His proclamation of 'neither Hindu nor Muslim' came into vogue in the '40s, when Shantiniketan against' cultural purity 'and from there, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi started talking about' cultural impurity '
 'ashok ke phool’ main unhone likhaa-''
 
 
 The life-force of man is very ruthless, he has been taunting the old fascinations of civilization and culture
 na jane kitne dharmacharon, vishwaason, utsavon or vraton ko dhoti-bahaati yah jeevanadhaara aage badi he
 Man has gained new power through struggles
 hamaare saamne samaaj kaa aaj jo rup he, vah na jane kitne grahan or tyaag kaa rup he
 The pure culture of the country and caste is the only thing
 sab kuch main milawat he, sab kuch avishuddh he
 "namvar ji has marked this cultural discovery and has also shown its isolation from Dinkar, Govind Chand Pandey and Agnaye etc
" kehane kaa taatpary yah ki bhartiya samskruti kii saavarkar dwaara prastaavit or golvarkar aadi dwaara viksit saanskrithik rashtravaadi dharna, jo pithrubhumi or punyabhumi ke antar ko maanati he, jo musalamaanon ko doum darje kaa naagarik maanati he, ke khilaaf hajaari prasad dvivedi, samskruti ke nirmaan main, mishrata or manushyatv ke anivaary tattvon kii khoj kar rahe the
 But this whole theology, as stated above, needs to be seen in the dynamics of the 40s environment
 hindu-musalmaan samudaayon main badhate hue raajnneetik antarvirodhon ko or peeche se chihnit karen to ham dekh sakate hai ki navajagaran ke tamaam vivekwaadi rujhaanon ke baavjood dharm ke prashn par ek khaas kism kii jakadbandi dikhaai detii he
 Barring a few exceptions, such as Premchand and Bhagat Singh, etc
, the renaissance of religion in the Hindi region has been less prudent
 hajaari prasad dvivedi ne apane liye ek doosraa rasta chunaa jo raashtra ke paribhaashik dhaanche ko badale bina usko or vistaarit karata he
 It was a process of universalization
 aadhunik kaal main rajasatta ke saath dharm ke sambandhon par kai tarah kii bahasein hai
 Almost all modern thinkers considered religion to be interfering with or intermingling with the modern state; That is, religion is the object of human personality and not interference in the state
 yaheen isi bindu par 'dharmanirpekshata’ kii avadharana kii utpatti maani ja sakati he
 But further there is divergences regarding the interpretation of secularism
 dharmanirpekshata ko vyakhyayit karne vaali ek dhara 'sarvadharm sambhaav’ kii baat karti he
 This similarity implies that the state will recognize all religions and treat them all in an equal sense
 duusari vyakhya ke mutabik 'sarvadharm varjayate’ hi rajasatta ke sandarbh main sahi dharmanirpekshata hogi
 Needless to say that such a basic difference is created between the two streams

 The Congress is happy that Narendra Modi's ban as Prime Minister candidate has created a rift in the NDA and he believes that the Chief Minister of Gujarat is a headache for the BJP
 congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne kaha, modi bhaajapa or rajg ke sirdard hai
 It will not affect the UPA
 ham us angal se use nahin dekh rahe hai
 We see his fast as the biggest hypocrisy of this decade
 dvivedi ne bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani par apratyaksh rup se kataaksh karte hue kaha ki aise logon ko modi kaa dhol peetna hoga, jo gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke samarthan ke bina apni raajnneeti nahin kar sakate
 While questioning for what purpose Modi fasted, Dwivedi said that it is strange that the person against whom people have complaints related to justice has fasted like this

 How are they feeling inside
 unhone kaha ki vastav main chaahe vah upwas ho yaa rath yatra ho yah sab party par niyantran hasil karne kii raajnneeti hai
 These days, everyone in the BJP is trying to establish its supremacy

 If in such circumstances, Modi is doing a fasting drama, then what is surprising? yah to mahaj shuruuaat he

 Manohar Parrikar, who resigned from the post of Defense Minister and became the Chief Minister of Goa, made a mistake in the oath taking ceremony
 darasal galati se parrikar ne mukhyamantri pad kii jagah mantri pad kii shapath le lee
 When Parrikar started swearing and returned, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari made him aware of this mistake

 Parrikar was also sworn in with 8 ministers
 parrikar ke mantrimandal main do bijepi ke, teen goa forward party ke tathaa do maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke vidhayak shaamil hai
 Two independents have also been made ministers
 yani maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke teenon vidhayak mantri banane main safal rahe jabaki goa forward party ke bhi teen main se do vidhayak mantri bane
 By appointing both the independents as ministers, it is clear that Parrikar has left no stone unturned to oblige the legislators in return for support for his government
 unhone aage kaha ki jab tak congress kii kaman sonia gandhi ke paas thi, jab tak sab thik tha
 After Rahul Gandhi's command, the party is not able to move forward

 She is said to be unhappy with the Congress leadership's decision to present Sheila Dixit as the Congress's chief ministerial candidate and that she felt more neglected after Raj Babbar was made Uttar Pradesh party chief
 tippaniyan He believes that he deserves more than Sheila Dixit to portray him as a Brahmin chief ministerial face
 reeta bahuguna ke bhai evam uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna kuch maheene pehle hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue the
 Currently, Rita has been an MLA from Lucknow Cantt seat
 reeta bahuguna kaa bhaajapa main shaamil hona party ke liye laabhakaari hoga kyonki party ko brahman vot ko ekajute karne main madad milegi
 The Congress announced Sheila Dixit as its chief ministerial candidate only after seeing the Brahmin vote
 unka maananaa he ki ek brahman mukhyamantri chehre ke taur par pesh karne ke liye unamem shila dikshit se adhik paatrata he
 Rita Bahuguna's brother and former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna joined BJP a few months ago
 philhal reeta lakhanu kii kaint seat se vidhayak rahi hai
 Rita Bahuguna's joining BJP will be beneficial for the party as it will help the party unify the Brahmin vote

 The petition said that under Article 333 of the Constitution, the Governor has the right to nominate an Anglo Indian member as a member of the Legislative Assembly, but can do so only on the advice of the Chief Minister, who is yet to undergo a majority test
 asal main bahumat pareekshan ke khel main ek-ek vidhayak kii sankhya bijepi ke liye myne rakhti he
 If an anglo-indian member was nominated on the advice of the BJP CM, he could vote in favor of the BJP
 isliye congress tatkaal ise rokane ke liye tatpar ho gai
 Significantly, elections were held in 222 seats in Karnataka, out of which BJP got 104 seats, Congress 78 and JD-S 38 seats

 Gandhiji recognized the hidden features of Desai in the first meeting and invited him to work with him
 gandhi ji or desai kaa jo sambandh 1917 main bana, vah 1942 main desai ke nidhan tak bana rahaa
 Mahadev Desai was instrumental in keeping Gandhiji's correspondence organized

 While the Jodhpur division is a strong stronghold of former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, it is clear that Rajput supporters of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh have not forgiven Raje for sidelining their leader in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 But i am not afraid
 '' unhone jor dekar kaha ki log unki sarkaar ke kaamon se khush hai or "mutthibhar'' pradarshnakariyon ke uthaae muddon kaa vikaas se koi lenaa-dena nahin he

 court ne jepi infrestracchar kii us yachika par sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya he, jisamen okhla pakshi vihaar ilaake main nirmaan kaary par lagi roak hataane kii baat kahi gai thi
 The court upheld the National Green Tribunal's stay
 court ke faisle ke baad kareeb 1 lakh flats ke bhavishya par taala lag gaya he
 On the plea of jaypee Infrastructure, the bench of Justices JS Kehar and Justice c Nagappan refused to hear it saying that the central government should be allowed to take a decision in the case

 'it is noteworthy that the Green Tribunal, in its judgment on October 28, 2013, stated that the 10 km radius of Okhla Bird Sanctuary falls in an environmentally and ecologically sensitive area
 aise main yahaan ban rahi imaaraton ko complishan certificate nahin diya jayega
 However, this decision of the court will clearly show the impact on more than 16 sectors of Noida
 okhla pakshi vihaar ke daayre main jepi, amrapali, aties, logics, gulshan, supertech or ajanara jaisi 53 companiyon ke project atake hai
 According to an estimate, after this decision, the price of about 1 lakh flats in the area may hang in the balance

 brisben test match romaanchak mode par he or ham jaise test match dekhne waalon ke liye yahi asli cricket he
 T20 and one-day thrills, but how mentally strong the players are, and how much water they are capable of, it can only be told by Test cricket
 australia daure main ab tak test cricket ke saat din beete hai, or har din donon tiimon ko laga ki match unki pakad main he, or yahi ek behtareen test match kii pahchaan bhi he
 It has been almost 10 years since T20 cricket, the eighth season of IPL is also coming
 is fatafat cricket kaa khel par kitna asar ho rahaa he, dhire-dhire ab jaakar test main bhi saamne aa rahaa he
 The batsmen of both teams are scoring freely
 har din ausatan 300 ran ban rahe hai or har ghadi maidan par kuch na kuch ection dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 This indicates that the players themselves also want to see something happening on the field with their mind
 masalan, ab brisben test main donon tiimon ke ballebaazon ko hi dekh lijie - abhi tak is test match main 14 khilaadi out hue hai, jinamein se nau ballebaaj set hone ke baad 15 se 35 ranon ke bich pavilion laute
 It is clear that most batsmen are finding it difficult to maintain concentration on the field for long, and if a bowler manages to keep them tied, they become restless
 agar 10-15 gendon tak koi chaukaa nahin lagata, to maano ballebaaz jhallaakar koi na koi bada shot khilne ko majaboor ho jaataa he
 Dropping balls, making the innings last, and standing at the crease as if things had happened yesterday
 aise main koi cricket chaahane vaala maayoos kaise na ho
 
 
 The itnaa hi nahin, gendbaazon kaa haal bhi kuch behatar nahin he
 Putting six balls in one place is becoming difficult for any bowler
 tii-20 or van-de main jis tarah se chah alag-alag genden daalkar kisi tarah over puraa karnaa hota he, vahi haal ab test cricket main dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 If you look at the graph or pitch-map of a bowler, then it becomes clear that he is forgetting the art of slowly throwing a batsman into his net
 cricket romaanchak zarur ho rahaa he, lekin cricket ke str par sawaal uthne lage hai
 It seems as if a five-day one-day match is taking place, not a Test match
 aise main kisi bhi test cricket ke chaahane vaale ko chintaa hona laazmi he

 Rahim's couplet can still be seen alive in the Hindi belt areas of India
 rahim kaa janm 17 disambar 1556 ko lahore main akbar ke sangrakshak bairam khan ke ghar hua tha
 The specialty of their couplets is that they are popular from educated to illiterate
 log aaj bhi rahim ke dohe kaa istemaal apane jivan main ghat rahi chizon ko bataane ke liye karte he
 Rahim's language was ganges-jamuni Tehzeeb
 unhen arabi, turki, farsi, sanskrit or hindi kii acchhee jaankaree thi
 Rahim has used the words of Hindi in his poetry
 yahi vajah thi ki rahim se khush hokar akbar ne unhen shahjadon ko pradaan kii jane vaali upadhi 'mirza khan' di thi
 Rahim Dohavali or Satsai, Barwai, Shringar, Soratha are important in Rahim's texts
 rahim muslim hote hue bhi bhagwaan krishna ke bhakt the, unhone bhagwaan krishna ke liye kai kavitaayen likhin
 Rahim prominently places the heroes of Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita in his poetry
 unhone turki bhashaa main likhi babar kii aatmakatha 'tujke babari' kaa farsi main anuwaad bhi kiya
 Rahim's important couplets 1
 kahi rahim sampati sage, banat bahut bahu reet
 Bipati Kasauti j kase, tei sanche mite ॥2
 chitrakoot main rami rahe, rahiman avadh nares
 There is calamity, so Avati Yesh Des ॥3
 naat neh duuri bhalee, jo rahim jiy jaani
 There is near disrespect, as soon as there is a cauldron
 pawas dekhi rahim man, koil saadhe maun
 Now we hear Dadur, who asks us who is 5? rahiman vipadaa hu bhalee, jo thore din hoy
 In the interest of the uninterested world, the life layer is all rahiman pani raakhie, binu pani sab sun
 No water is lost, Moti Manush Chun ॥7
 samay pare oche vachan, sabake sahai rahim
 Gathering with mace yah na rahim saraahie, len dein kii priti
 Pranan baazi rakiye, hara hai kai jiti ॥9
 jo rahim ochho badhai, tau ati hi itaraay
 Fearing Faraji, padded, twisted crooked rahimah oche naran so, bair bhalee naa preet
 Bitten like swan, unlike both

 The Rarakai states reduced the penalty on the new Motor Vehicle Act, making their own law a problem for the central government of the Bharatiya Janata Party, giving the slogan of 'one country one legislation', the BJP state topper
 trephic niyamon kaa paalan karne ke liye laae gaye nae motor whical act main jurmaana raashi ko kaaphi badhaayaa gaya
 Under the law, which came into force from September 1, thousands of challans were cut, but many state governments have become cautious
 kai rajya sarkaron ne kanoon main sanshodhan kar jurmaana raashi ko hi gata diya or in rajyon kii list main bhartiya janata party ke rajya hi awwal hai
 Under this new law of Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, the fine amount was increased from 1000 to 5 thousand or 10 thousand rupees

 Gujarat showed the way: In the midst of chaos among the common people, the state governments took a juggle of this law and this formula was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah's home state Gujarat
 rajya ke mukhiya vijay roopaani ne ek press conference kar jurmaana raashi main katautee kaa elaan kiya or kai jurmaanon main raashi ko 90 fisadi tak gata diya

 And the special thing is that these three states are bjp-ruled states
 gujarat ke baad maharashtra jaagaa or rajya ke parivahan mantri ne nitin gadakari ko chitthee likh di, jurmaana raashi par chintaa jataai
 The government of Devendra Fadnavis is worried that the increased amount will not reduce the number of votes
 maharashtra kii hi raah par jharkhand or haryana chal pade, jharkhand jald hi vishesh satr bulaakar centre ke nae motor whical act main sanshodhan kar saktaa he to vahiin haryana ne abhi 45 dinon kaa jaagruk abhiyaan chalaane kii baat kahi he
 Also Read: Center Vs State On Challan! These states have not been able to withstand even 12 days of road safety, elections are also going on without worry, there are elections in maharashtra-jharkhand-haryana, so the decision to reduce the penalty is being seen from the political prism but other than this Uttarakhand and Karnataka also become part of this line

 Apart from these states, there are many BJP ruled states where the notification of new law has not been issued
 udhaaharan ke taur par desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main abhi nayaa motor whical act lagu nahin hua he
 Not only BJP states but many opposition parties' states have also not implemented this law

 In such a situation, it can be understood that how important is the law on road safety

 ek anumaan ke anusaar, bharat main pratidin 1300 se zyada sadak haadase hote hai or duniyabar main kul sadak haadason ke 10 fisadi haadase akele bharat main hote hai
 The Supreme Court has formed a committee to implement the rules of road safety and 10% of the expenditure of the highway ministry is on road safety alone
 bina gaadi vaale bhi mahfuj nahin hai
 38 percent of those who die in road accidents are people who are walking, while 30 percent are bicycles or motorcycles
 international road federation ke mutabik 90 fisadi haadase driver kii galati kii vajah se hote hai
 It is worth noting that the total expansion of the country's national highways is about 97,000 km, which the government aims to increase to 200,000 km in the next five years
 desh main sadakon kii kul lambaai 52 lakh kilometre he, lekin rashtriya rajmarg par desh ke kul trephic kaa 40 fisadi boj he, jabaki rashtriya rajmarg desh ke kul sadakon kaa mahaj 2 fisadi hi he
 Due to this, the figures of road accidents are increasing

 Black spots on highways are called places where most accidents occur

 According to Gadkari, work to build and improve these places is going on at a rapid pace
 ab ise ek satat prakriya ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 New black spots are identified and corrected
 sadak durghatnaon main logon ke marane kaa aakanda isliye bhi zyada hota he kyonki sadak durghatana main ghayal vyakti ko vaazib aakasmik upachaar milane main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 In order to deal with this matter, the government has set a special guideline as per the directions of the Supreme Court, according to which good people who reach the injured will not be questioned or harassed in any way on behalf of the hospital, police or other agencies
 inke alaava mantralay intelegent trephic system ko lagu karne ke prayaas main bhi juta hua he

 On-field umpire Kumar Dharmasena gave six runs to England after talking to his fellow umpires

 While some experts believe that only five runs should have been given
 aisi sthiti main england ko newjiland ke khilaaf ek ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padataa jisane aath wicket par 241 ran banaae the
 Anderson, Stokes' partner in the Test team, said the all-rounder apologized for raising his hand immediately after the overthrow and appealed to the umpires to change their decision
 anderson ne kaha ki, 'cricket main shishtachar bhi hota he
 If the ball is thrown towards the stump and it hits you and goes into the gap, then you do not take a run, but if it goes to the boundary then according to the rule, it should be four and you are nothing in this case
 Can do
 ' anderson ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki maaikel won se baat karne ke baad, jinhone stokes se match ke baad mulaakaat kii thi, stokes match ke vakt hi ampiron ke paas gaye the or kaha tha 'aap chaar ran waapas le sakate hai, hamen isaki jarurat nahin he

 What was the whole matter? Chasing New Zealand's target of 242 runs in the final of the World Cup, England had to score 9 runs from the last three balls
 isi dauraan ben stokes ne trent bolt kii gend ko deep-midwicket par khelaa jahaan se martin gaptil ne thro kiya to gend ran out hone se bachane ke liye dive lagaate samay ben stokes ke balle se lagakar boundry ke paar chali gai
 In this way, Kumar Dharmasena, talking to fellow umpire Erasmus, gave England 6 runs, for which Ben Stokes had refused to give him only two runs, but according to the rule, 4 runs of overthrow got more
