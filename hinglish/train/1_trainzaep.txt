 While Jharkhand has a clear mandate, it is fragmented in Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki bijepi vahaan duusare number kii party banakar ubhari he, lekin vah apane boote sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he
 This is the party of pdpka, which is number one, but is looking for a partner to form the government
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar ye donon milakar sarkaar banaaen, to rajya kaa bhala hoga
 But it has many screws
 aaie dekhte hai ki ve paanch kya masale hai jo donon ko milakar sarkaar banane se roak rahe hai
 1
 pidipi or bijepiki vichaardhaara alag-alag hai
 Both fought against each other in the elections and the party does not agree with the Hindu ideology of the BJP
 agar jammu-kashmir ke maamle main party apni vichaardhaara main badlaav dikhaati he to vah uskaa saath de sakati he
 2
 pidipi congress kii ore zyada jhukaav rakhti he
 But the pdp's problem is that the Congress has been rejected in the state and there is no inclination towards it
 uske saath judakar party ko kuch nahin milegaa
 If the BJP assures him that the party will give him unconditional funds for development, then a government can be formed with the BJP
 3
 BJP should completely reject the National Conference
 agar vah use chhodkar sarkaar banavaane main dilchaspee dikhaati he, to pidipi ke saath baat ban sakati he
 4
 agar bijepi pidipi ko yah aashwaasan de ki vah chah varshon tak mufti mohammad said ko rajya kaa mukhyamantri bane rahane degi, to baat aage bad sakati he
 The PDP wants Saeed to complete his tenure there without interruption
 5
 BJP has to take care that parties like RSS, Bajrang Dal do not spoil the atmosphere of Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir dharm ke lihaaj se bahut hi samvedshil rajya he
 Here, if the party takes work from the evening, the PDP will support it
 iske liye piem modi or amit shah ko khud pahal kerani hogi
 If these five things are fulfilled, then PDP-BJP government can be formed in Jammu and Kashmir
 agar bijepi sarkaar main shaamil nahin hui to isse jammu ke logon ko nuksaan hoga, kyonki unhone unhen thok main vot die hai or ve bhi vikaas chaahate hai
 a unique picture seen in Ambala, Haryana, written in the posterposters outside the houses in the Muslim slum - modi-modi shout to open the door, many colors are seen in the election environment
 netaaon or partiyon kii taraf se votaron ko lubhaane ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiye jate hai or prachaar ke nae-nae tareeke apanaae jate hai
 But during the Haryana Assembly elections, a picture has emerged from Ambala where voters have adopted a unique way of giving support
 ambala kii ek muslim basti main gharon ke baahar kuch poster lagaae gaye hai
 It has been written on these posters that the door-bell here is bad, please call modi-modi to open the door
 yah ghatana ambala chhavnee ilaake kii ek muslim basti kii he
 The story behind why these posters were installed is very interesting
 is muslim basti ke logon ne bataaya ki chunavi maahaul main bahut pratyaashee unke paas vot kii apil ke liye aate hai or vah baar-baar door bel bajaate hai
 Therefore, these posters have been put up for the same candidates
 sirf modi-modi bolne waalon ke liye khulegaa darwazalogon kaa kahana he ki tamaam partiyon ke netaa unke paas vot maangane aate hai, lekin unhen apana samarthan pradhanmantri modi ko dena he

 As the Delhi Legislative Assembly draws near, the weather in Delhi has started turning into an electoral color
 rajdhani main zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane ke liye bijepi ne ab auton main poster lagaakar prachaar karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 This time the exercise has been started to use auto for campaigning
 isaki shuruyaat bijepi se jude bhartiya majdoor sangh ne ne kii he
 Auto people associated with this will now create an atmosphere for people to vote in favor of BJP
 apane auton main poster lagaakar in logon ne abhi se prachaar bhi shuru kar diya he
 BJP in its posters made the issue of crime, corruption and inflation rising in Delhi
 jahaan aam aadmi party ne apane naaron main shila dikshit ko beyimaan or arvind kejariwal ko eemaandaar bataaya he, vahiin, bijepi ne bhi isaki suraksha or buniyadi suvidhaon ko mudda banaaya he
 Looking at this effort, it seems that the weather of Delhi has started getting colored in electoral colors
 auto ke jariye chunaav prachaar kaa tarika nayaa he
 It is to be seen that how much people like this method
 beete da din bazaar main raunak korporate tex main katautee kii vajah se rahi On Saturday night, Hrithik Roshan opened up in a TV interview and talked about his relationship with Kangana
 intervyuu main unhone bataaya ki unka kangana ke saath koi rishta nahin tha
 Many syllabes came up on this issue and supported Hrithik
 isi list main ab farhaan akhtar kaa naam bhi jud gaya he
 He has shared a letter on Facebook
 unhone likhaa he- aaj maine ek open letters padhaa, jo ek vyakti ne ek mahila ke liye likhaa he
 This dispute has been going on for a long time, but as far as i know, this man has made his point for the first time
 mere paas yah kehane kaa adhikaar nahin he ki koun sahi he or koun galat, lekin mujhe lagata he ki in ghatnaon par coment karnaa jaruri he
 Hrithik said on Kangana controversy - Forget the engagement, never even talked face to face
 Like many, i also feel that most of the women in our society are suppressed
 yah bahut bhayanak he ki rape ke kuch cases main samaaj ke kuch hisson ne peedita ko doshi mana he
 4 years ago i founded MARD (men Against Rape & Discrimination)
 iske jariye main ling sambandhi hinsa ke khilaaf ladanaa chahta tha
 In some incidents women are mistaken, but there is a difference between some and all
 haalanki kuch cese aise bhi hote hai, jahaan purushon kaa peechha kiya jaataa he, unka shoshan hota he or un par galat aarope lagaae jate hai
 This truth has also been accepted by the best court of our country
 rithik bole-main chup rahata to log kangana kii baat par yakeen kar leteyah sab dekhte hue aaj mujhe jarur bolnaa chahie
 The way this controversy has been shown in the media is worrying
 hamaare kuch bade patrakaron ne us mahila kii sachai jane bina ekatarfa kahani ko sabake saamne pesh kiya
 Is it not discrimination with the other party? For the time being, keep aside all feelings, prejudice and look at the facts which are present
 wo mahila kahati hai ki unka 7 saal kaa afaire tha or us dauraan donon ne bahut se i-mels share kiya
 Dispute with Kangana: 2 years later, Hrithik gave a clarification in 766 words, although the man denied that he did not e-mail
 usne shikaayat bhi darj karvaa di he
 All documents, your phone, laptop have been submitted
 lekin aisa mahila ne nahin kiya he
 For some reason or the other, she is refusing to do so
 apana phone or leptop dena sirf kanoonee taur par hi sahi nahin hoga, balki yah sabit bhi karegaa ki wo sach kah rahi he
 There are more than thousand e-mails sent from the woman's official e-mail account in her official e-mail account
 uske contate sexual bhi he
 She says that she did not send this email, instead the person hacked her account and mailed herself
 agar wo 7 saal tak rishte main the, to use aisa karne kii kya jarurat thi
 So did he reply to any mail from the woman? As far as we know
 
 
 nahin, ek kaa bhi riplai nahin kiya
 Stop here and ask yourself
 agar kisi mahila ko aise mels milte or wo ise utpeedan kahati
 What would be your reaction then? Would you have believed that person if he had said that he was in a relationship and the woman hacked his account and sent mails to himself
 abhi or he
 
 
 The woman shared a picture, which had both
 usne kaha ki yah us samay kaa he jab donon kaa afaire tha
 He also had friends in the real picture, with his wife (now x-wife)
 kyon dusron ko jaanboojh kar crop kar diya gaya
 The woman has no message and picture to prove that the two were in a relationship of 7 years
 unke paris main hue tathakthith sagaai kii bhi koi tasviir nahin he
 Kangana had rejected Salman's 'bajrangi Bhaijaan'
 kya yah sab aapke dimag main sawaal paidaa nahin karti?to sachai kya he?darasal sachai yah he ki ham sachai jaanate hi nahin
 i have said all this today because some people have already reached the conclusion and some people are giving women the freedom to continue speaking
 yah sab yah bina soche kiya ja rahaa he ki mahila ke shabdon se us purush ke parivaar or bacchon par kya asar padegaa
 It may be for TRP, but it is very terrible
 jab tak faisla nahin aa jaataa, tab tak kisi ke bayaan ke aadhaar par kisi ko jaj karnaa sahi nahin he
 Aditi Rao Hydari and Karan Johar have supported Farhan
 aditi ne twit kar likhaa- sach he
 i hope that TRP of people does not become a spectacle

 Breast cancer, which has always been a fear for women, is now becoming a cause of concern for men as well
 chikitsakon kaa daawa he ki ab purush bhi is beemaari kaa aasaan shikaar ban rahe hai
 Many leading medical experts of the country believe that the incidence of breast cancer among men has increased rapidly in recent years
 chikitsak iske liye badalati jeevanstyli ko ek pramukh kaaran maan rahe hai
 Senior Consultant of Indraprastha Apollo Hospital: Surgical Ankology: Dr
 samir kaul ke mutabik ‘‘purushon main stan cancer ke maamle kul stan cancer ke maamalon main do fisadi tak bade hai
 The risk of breast cancer in men increases due to increased levels of estrogen hormone
 iarasiech-ames main radiation vibhaag ke pramukh dow
 PK Jhulka said, "the presence of extra x chromosome in men is called Kleinfelter syndrome
" kai baar yah purushon main stan cancer kaa kaaran hota he, lekin purushon main yah beemaari anuvaanshik asamanyta ke kaaran bhi ho sakati he
 "the Indian Council of Medical Research recently presented a Consolidated Report of Population Based Cancer Registry", a report on data for 1990-96, in which about 2% of total breast cancer in men
 77 fisadi maamle paae jane kii jaankaree di gai he
 Dr

 "experts claim that if detected at an early stage, breast cancer in men can be cured up to 95 percent

 Experts claim that men do not openly come forward with regard to the disease due to social beliefs
 kai sanghathan is beemaari ke prati jaagarukta failaane ke liye vibhinn gatividhiyaan yojit karte hai
 The organization Forum for Breast Cancer Protection is going to organize a rally on April 1 from Delhi to Jaipur
 haalanki shiv sena bal thakare or anti krime and animal protection association unke samarthan main utar aae hai

 Election campaign has come to a halt in Karnataka but this campaign kept bjp's star leader Shatrughan Sinha away

 He tagged Modi in the tweet and said that becoming Prime Minister does not make anyone intelligent
 itnaa hi unhone prachaar ke dauraan piem modi kii bhashaa par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Shatrughan tweeted that the election campaign in Karnataka has come to an end, but like Bihar and UP, i was not called to campaign here, the reason we all know
 lekin ek puraane dost kii tarah main itnaa kahana chaahunga ki aapako pradhanmantri pad kii garima rakhni chahie
 Why do we come with odd & ridiculous definitions

 Anything can happen
 Being PM does not make anyone the wisest in the country
 
 
 
 for being PM requires no qualification
 
 
 only majority

 Shatrughan Sinha has been meeting leaders of several opposition parties continuously for some time

 uttar pradesh main bijepi ko 2017 ke chunaav main prachand janadesh mila
 The BJP alliance ended its 14-year exile in the state by winning 325 out of 403 seats
 mukhyamantri kaa taj yogi adityanath ke sir sajaa, to dipti siem keshav prasad maury or dinesh sharma bane
 Yogi Sarkar's one-year political journey has been completed on March 19
 gorakhpur-phulpur upachunaav kii haar ne bijepi ke jashn ko feekaa kar diya
 This is the reason that now the Yogi cabinet is going to be reshuffled
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki soobe kii sarkaar main top thri main bhi koi badlaav hoga yaa phir mantriyon tak hi simit rahegaa
 Explain that the path of Delhi's power is decided from UP
 is baat se bijepi bakhubi waakif he
 UP has also played an important role in Modi's coming to power in 2014
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav jaisaa nateeja 2019 main dohraane ke liye bijepi abhi se jameen taiyaar karnaa chaahati he
 In view of this, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat spent 10 days in UP
 is dauraan unhone soobe kii siyaasi nabj ko samajha
 After this, BJP President Amit Shah met the Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and took feedback of the state
 isi maddenjar agle maheene soobe kaa daura karenge
 Yogi will have his first cabinet expansion after BJP President Amit Shah's UP visit on 10 April
 is vistaar main kai mantriyon kii chuttee ho sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi can also be included in the Yogi government
 is pherbadal main kuch varisht mantriyon ko hataakar sanghathan kii jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 In such a situation, there is doubt about the trio of the state
 yogi adityanathyogi adityanath mukhyamantri rahete hue bhi apane durg gorakhpur ko nahin bachaa sake
 Whereas BJP had not lost the last three decades in Gorakhpur
 iske baavjood upachunaav main bijepi ummidavaar ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 After the defeat in Gorakhpur, the working style of Yogi Adityanath has been raised from both inside and outside the party
 itnaa hi nahin un par jatvaad kaa aarope bhi laga
 Yogi currently has around 36 ministries including the home ministry
 itnaa hi nahin om prakaash rajbhar yogi ke bajaay keshav maury ko siem banaae jane kii maang bhi uthaa chuke hai
 However, after the by-election defeat, party president Amit Shah praised Yogi's performance
 aise main unke kursi par kisi tarah kaa koi khatra nahin he
 But some departments can be taken
 keshav prasad mauryauttar pradesh kii satta main duusare number kii ahmiyat rakhane vaale keshav prasad maury bhi apana garh phulpur nahin bachaa sake
 Whereas he has been running the government parallel to Yogi in the state
 keshav ke paas soobe main peedblyoody sahit 4 vibhaagon kaa jimmaa he
 After the defeat in Phulpur, there has been a voice of his removal from the post of Deputy CM in his own area
 yogi sarkaar main keshav obisi cheharaa maane jate hai
 The mutual bitterness of yogi-keshav is well known
 aise main kya keshav par bhi cabinet pherbadal kii gaaj giregi?dinesh sharmasoobe kii yogi sarkaar main dinesh sharma dipti siem ke saath-saath madhyamik or ucch shiksha sahit paanch vibhaagon kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe hai
 Dinesh Sharma is considered close to the Sangh and the party high command
 party kii limlite se dur rahete hai
 He was given a place in the cabinet as a Brahmin face in the party
 philhal vivaadon main wo nahin rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to take any steps against him in the expansion of the cabinet

 The people of the village had issued a decree about four months ago to marry the five-year-old daughter of this woman to an eight-year-old child after a panchayat
 " unhone kaha ki is maamle main jila prashasan ne tarapur gaanv ke sabhi rahavaasiyon ko chetavanee di he ki yadi unhone is ladki ke parivaar ke sadasyon par jabaran shaadi karne ke liye dabaav daalaa, to unke khilaaf exiaar darj hoga

 bachade kii maut ke baad se panchayat ne mere parivaar kaa saamaajik bahishkaar kar diya
 According to the complaint, the society had given a Panchayat at that time and asked my family to rejoin the Ganga bath and the entire village was ordered by Bhandare
 parivaar ne kisi tarah panchayat ke faisle ko puraa kiya, lekin iske baad bhi samaaj ke logon ne gaanv main sabhi tarah kaa len-dein, gaanv ke handpump se pani band kara diya tha
 Later the villagers again panchayat and said that there are many young men who want to get married in the village, but they are unable to get married due to this family member killing the calf
 yah bachade ko maarane kaa shraap he
 Khan told, "the villagers met the victim and told the victim that no young man and woman of the village were getting married due to the killing of the calf
 isliye hamen sthaneey parampara ke anusaar is shraap se chhootane ke liye sabase pehle tumhaari beti kii shaadi kerani hogi

 Today's important poet Nilesh Raghuvanshi has recorded in his poems the resistance of the common man in an inhuman system
 vaise unke yahaan virodh kii abhivyakti kisi roodhi ke tahat nahin hoti
 He is the subject of discussion on the happiness and sorrow of a woman
 ''khidki khulne ke baad" unki kavyayatra kaa ek ahm padaav he
 The loneliness of the person and to some extent depression has also emerged, which is definitely the product of the changing society
 hamane aisa samaaj bana daalaa he jisamen samuhikta kaa lop he
 The distance between the person and the person has not only increased but they have also increased hatred and doubt
 yatharth itani teji se badal rahaa he ki uskaa koi sira pakad main nahin aa rahaa
 In Nilesh's words, "how fast life changes / cannot see one scene completely / that surrounds another scene
" "ek saadhaaran aadmi drishyon ke bich bebas he kyonki jo kuch ghat rahaa he vah uski samaj se baahar he
 There are other people who control the situation, who do not know anything except trade - "the forests are not far away, in the middle of the city / The forest itself is a business / The forest is in the city, The city is in business / The business country is all over the world
" Is in " kavyitri aise hi logon se puuchhati hai, ''kreta-vikreta ban chuke tum / kya akaash ko bhi bedakhal karoge / uski jagah se?" bazaar kendrit vyavastha ne ped, jangal, pahaad, chidipha se lekar kisaan, majdoor sabko ast-vyast kar diya he
 But the poet realizes that the voices of protest have weakened
 virodh-pradarshnon ne apni vishwasaneeyata kho di he
 The "hikrat" poem is an indication of how the distance from the middle class has increased with public questions
 aise main neelesh kaa sawaal he ki kya aaj pratirodh kaa koi nayaa muhaavara khojna hoga? unki yahi khaasiyat he ki ve apane nijee anubhav ko bhi ek vyapak raajnneetik sandarbh de detii hai

 The pandemonium of Raj Thackeray's party MNS (maharashtra Navnirman Sena) against the protest against Pakistani artists has come to light
 jabase is mudde par abhinayta salmaan khan ne pakistani kalakaaron ko samarthan diya he tab se emenes ko maano saanp soongh gaya he
 Now the party is not responding in its aggressive style
 isse pehle, uri main sena ke camp ko aatankiyon dwaara nishaanaa banane kaa zikr karte hue emenes ne kaha tha ki bollywood se pakistani kalakaar waapas laut jaaen
 Taking the issue further, MNS also announced to stop the performances of films Raees and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil
 saath hi nirmaataa-nirdeshak karan johar ke daftar ke baahar ugr pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 During this, the case was further aggravated by the return of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' actor and Pakistani artist Fawad Khan
 puure ghatnakram main nayaa mode tab aayaa jab is maamle par abhinayta salmaan khan ne apana rukh saaf kiya
 Salman responded to media queries in Mumbai and said that Pakistani artists are not terrorists
 ve to vija or work permit par is desh main aate hai
 After this attitude of Salman, when the media personnel wanted to know his response to Ameya Khopkar, the president of MNS cine unit, he spoke with aplomb that why MNS should talk on this issue every time? Why no one else speaks? Comments bataaya jaataa he ki emenes kii is bhoomika main badlaav ke peeche party supremeo raaj thakare or actor salmaan khan kii dosti vajah he
 While Raj Thackeray attends Ganesh Pujan at Salman's house, Salman has participated in events organized by MNS
 aise main party ke doum darje ke netaa aakraamak bayaan dekar aalaa kaman kii dosti main khalal daalana nahin chaahate
 Therefore, MNS has not announced any movement against Salman
 vaise is chuppi kaa mauka takate hue shivasena ne salmaan ko naseehat di he
 Shiv Sena Minister Subhash Desai has said that Salman should consult his father in the matter of patriotism
 saleem khan is maamle main behatar jaankaree rakhte hai
 Earlier, MNS had said that Pakistani artists should return to Bollywood from Bollywood, targeting the army camp in Uri
 apane mudde ko aage badhaate hue emenes ne film 'rais' or 'i dil he mushkil' ke pradarshan rokane kaa elaan bhi kiya tha
 At the same time, producer-director Karan Johar also had a fierce performance outside the office
 is dauraan 'i dil he mushkil' ke actor or pakistani kalakaar fawaad khan ke swadesh laut jane se maamle ko or tool mila
 a new twist in the entire development came when actor Salman Khan made his stand clear on the matter
 salmaan ne mumbai main media ke sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue kaha ki pakistani kalakaar aatanki nahin hai
 They come to this country on visas and work permits
 salmaan ke is ravaiye ke baad emenes kii sine ikai ke adhyaksh amey khopakar se jab unki pratikriya media karmiyon ne janani chaahi to ve tapaak se bol gaye ki kyon aakhir har baar emenes hi is mudde par baat kare? koi or kyon nahin bolta?tippaniyan It is said that the friendship of party supremo Raj Thackeray and actor Salman Khan is the reason behind the change in this role of MNS
 raaj thakare salmaan ke ghar ganesh pujan main hajiri lagaate hai to salmaan emenes dwaara yojit kaaryakramon main hissaa le chuke hai
 In such a situation, the second-tier leaders of the party do not want to disturb the friendship of the high command by making aggressive statements
 isliye emenes ne salmaan ke khilaaf andolan kaa koi elaan nahin kiya he
 By the way, looking at the opportunity of this silence, Shiv Sena has advised Salman
 shivasena mantri subhash desai ne kaha he ki salmaan apane pita se rashtrabhakti maamle main salaah len
 Salim Khan is better informed in this matter
 puure ghatnakram main nayaa mode tab aayaa jab is maamle par abhinayta salmaan khan ne apana rukh saaf kiya

 He said that the eclipse of the sun and the moon is merely a game of shadow
 iske alaava unhone bataaya tha ki purna chandra grahan tambe kii tarah laal rang kaa hi hota he
 Let me tell you, when Aryabhata wrote this scientific fact, he was just 23 years old

 In addition, he also gave a complete mathematical explanation of eclipses
 is sadi main dobaaraa dekhne ko nahin milegaa aisa chandragrahan, jaan len samayamtaur par chandramaa purna grahan ke samay puri tarah se kaala nahin hota he, balki usamen thodi chamak aa jaati he

 inamen varnakram kaa laal vaala hissaa kuch zyada hi mudata he
 This light of the sun first reaches the surface of the moon, due to which the moon does not completely dissipate at the time of complete eclipse, but we see it in red

 In the electoral history of Uttarakhand, whichever party candidate won from the Gangotri seat, the same party was formed in the state
 aise main yahaan ek kahawat prachlit ho gai he ki jisane jeeta gangotri seat uske paas rahegi satta
 Religion guru calls this combination of politics as the infinite grace of the fallen mother Ganges
 ise uttarkashi jile kii is seat ko lekar chaahe sanyog maane yaa chamatkaar, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki jis bhi dal kaa pratyaashee uttarkashi se jeeta pradesh main uski hi sarkaar banati ai he
 Now this coincidence has joined the Gangotri assembly seat, which after the formation of Uttarakhand was converted into an assembly seat in Uttarkashi district
 varsh 2000 menuttarakhandrajya ke astitv main aane ke baad vidhansabha siton ke parisemen se uttarkashi vidhansabha jonsaar, tehri, purola, yamunotri or gangotri chaar vidhansabha siton main bant gaya
 In the first elections held in the state in the year 2002, Vijaypal Sajwan of Congress reached the assembly after winning from Congress, again in 2012, after the victory of Congress Vijaypal, his party formed the Congress government in the state
 ab aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki yah sayog aakhir kab tak you hi barkaraar rahegaa
 Myth is associated with Uttarkashi for 60 years This myth has been associated with this seat of Uttarkashi
 varsh 1958 main upi kaa hissaa rahe tehri jile ke uttarkashi seat se congress ke ramchandra uniyaal vidhayak bane, to rajya main congress kii sarkaar bani
 After this, Krishna Singh of Congress became MLA thrice, then Congress government was formed in the state three times
 1974 main uttarkashi vidhansabha seat anusuchit jati ke liye ghoshit hone par yahaan congress netaa baldev singh arya vidhayak bane, tab bhi pradesh main congress kii sarkaar bani
 At the same time, during the political turmoil after the Emergency, the Janata Party came into existence
 us samay janata party ke barfia laal juvatha chunaav jite or pradesh main janata party kii sarkaar bani
 In such a situation, both the BJP and Congress parties have always put their full force on the Gangotri assembly to keep this myth associated with Uttarkashi seat
 is baar bhi hoga ye chamatkaar?gangotri vidhansabha seat ke is sanyog ko dekhte hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress is baar bhi apane sitting ummidavaar par daav khilne vaali he, to vahiin duusari ore bijepi bhi apane sabase majboot ummidavaar gopal ravat ko maidan main utaar chuki he
 Gopal Rawat has already won the BJP by winning elections
 lihaaja gangotri seat par jo chunavi dwandv hona he uske parinaam ko lekar donon party ke saath-saath aam log bhi utsahit hai
 It remains to be seen whether the seat which has decided the fate of the party since 1958, will be able to repeat history this time too

 If this fundamental right is violated, the Supreme Court is bound to defend it
 unhone bataaya ki agar koi navadanpati apni jaan ko khatra bataate hue supreme court yaa hoicourt jaataa he, to nyaayalay police or sarkaar ko aadesh de sakate hai ki navadanpati ko suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaae

 After this, Sakshi and her husband Ajitesh Kumar have filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court seeking protection

 According to DCP Shahji Umap, the body of Satish, who came to Mumbai from Coimbatore on January 11, was found hanging from a fan in the room of Kamala Guest House in Chembur 4 days later
 uski ek haath kii kalai kati thi or farsh par khun failaa hua tha
 The door of the room was locked from outside and the young man's phone was missing, so the police registered a case of murder and started investigating
 par ab jab raaj par se pardaa khulaa to puraa maamla hatya kaa naa hokar khudakushi kaa niklaa
 On January 14, the first suspicion of the Chembur police involved in the investigation of the crime by registering a case of murder, went to the person behind the young man in CCTV, because in another CCTV the man was seen going out of the guest house after some time
 tippaniyan According to the police, at first they did not find the person seen in CCTV, but it was found that the deceased was a jeweler by profession and was from Kerala

 Troubled by the debtors' tirade, he, along with Mohammad Riaz and Sharvanan, had unsuccessfully tried to rob and steal a businessman, but when all the plans failed, he decided to commit suicide, but the family owed it to him even if he committed suicide
 The money does not go away and the insurance is not available, so with the help of Riyaz, Kudkushi conspired to get the insurance money by showing him a murder incident
 iske liye usne riyaaz ko 4 lakh 50 hajaar ke kareeb rupee bhi diye, lekin uskaa drama pakadaa gaya
 Life was lost and insurance money was not received

 Yosef Banash has used many more symbols to confirm the visit of Jesus Christ to India
 kathy main unhen is tarah piroyaa gaya he ki vah sach prathit hote hai
 For example, according to the book, the 'divine' compassion of Jesus Christ to cure serious patients was given by the countless books of medicine available in the ancient Taxila University
 ise or amalijama pehanaane ke liye yojef ne dakshin bharat se isa messiah kii kashmir tak kii yatra ke bich kai prasangon ko zikr kiya he
 Not only this, they have tried to establish the legends mentioned in the Jewish religious texts by matching them with the Indian Vedas and Puranas
 masalan, yojeff apni kitaab main ek jagah kehete hai
 
 
 Isn't it strange that according to your Torah, Abraham is the father of all the countries and according to the Vedas, Brahma is the father of the whole creation
 ' ek or udhaaharan dekhen
 
 
 It is written in one of our Vedas that the first men and women on earth were 'asta' and 'ambala'
 ' is par yishu sir hilaate hue kehete hai-'hamaare aadam or eve
 'many such passages in the book run in stories threaded in two different parallel periods
 ek he mishaal kii patni marika ke paatro kaa
 Marika has breast cancer and believes that praying at the tomb of Christ will cure her breast cancer
 isa messiah kii kabr par prarthana kii marika kii ichha use yerusalem le jaati he, jahaan tomash se mulaakaat use bharat ke praant kashmir tak le aati he
 Kashmir is badly surrounded by the shadow of terror in those days
 bhartiya sena aatank kaa daman karne ke liye srinagar ke chappe-chappe par tainaat he
 In such a situation, Marika is willing to take the local doctor Basharat and his son Ali to the tomb, which is also said to be the tomb of Jesus Christ
 iske saamanantar hi isa messiah kii kahani chalati he
 This story tells that Jesus did not receive the cure to cure patients suffering from incurable diseases from anywhere else but from the world famous Taxila University
 takshashila main isa ke aagaman se paanch sau saal pehle ek ek greek vidwaan padhaayaa karata tha, jinhone isa ke bharat aagaman kii 'bhavishyavaanee' kii thi
 Based on this other end of the story, it is established that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but was taken to India after the crucifixion
 dakshin bharat se shuru hua isa messiah kaa safar takshashila hote hue kashmir tak pahunchataa he, jahaan lagbhag 70 saal kii umr main vah antat mrityu ko praapt hote hai
 To give credibility to this parallel story, numerous episodes have been resorted to
 salmaan khan se nahin bardaasht hui dusron kii takalif, hunter lekar khud ko hi lage maarane, dekhen Video'yerusalem se kashmir tak' apane rochak prasangon se pathneey ban jaati he

 twitter
 com / rvlx64nex5— ANI (@ANI) November 17, 2019 There was something like Bala Saheb's answer Bala Saheb Thackeray answered this question using very bitter words
 bala sahib se is intervyuu main poocha gaya tha, "sar kya chunaav ke baad ensipi ke saath jane kii koi sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 
 
 Any alliance? "bal Thackeray, while answering this question, had said," What are the possibilities in politics
 
 
 raajnneeti ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ye dushton kaa khel he, ab ye ek shaks ko tay karnaa he ki wo yaa to jentalman bana rahanaa chahta he yaa phir
 
 
 "he continued," i will not go with such a person, whatever it may be
 
 
 "padhein: cartoonist kii naukari chhod bal thakare ne banaai thi shivasena, nikaale the ye akhbaar1999 kaa vakt, aaj jaise halatbaal thakare se jab intervyuu liya ja rahaa tha us vakt kisi ne sochaa hoga ki 20 saal baad shivasena supremeo uddhav thakare ke saamne aisa hi mauka aayega jab unke saamne ensipi ko chunane kaa vikalp hoga
 However, the current situation has reached government formation, while Bal Thackeray was questioned on the prospects in the electoral atmosphere at that time
 is intervyuu main aage unase poocha gaya tha ki agar unhen kuch siton kii kami hui to kya ve ensipi kaa samarthan lenaa pasand karenge
 In response, he said, "never
 
 
 kabhi nahin
 
 
 How can we even think of joining hands with such a person who is responsible for toppling Vajpayee's government
 
 
 meraa kehane kaa matlab he ki main to aisa kabhi nahin karuunga, kabhi nahin
 
 
 An enemy is an enemy
 "'sarkarein giraane main maahir hai sharad pavaar'bal thakare ne aage intervyuu main kaha ki ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne khuleam kaha tha ki haa meri jimmedaari thi ki sarkaar gira di jaae, maine wo kar diya he
 
 
 He specializes in doing this
 bal thakare ne kaha ki hamen damege pahunchane ke liye vahi shaks jimmedaar he
 He said that now think about those voters, wouldn't they tell us that you are cheating the public
 thakare ne kaha tha ki log hamen ye kahenge ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aap to us party ke bare main itani sari buree baaten kah rahe the, ab aap haath mila rahe hai to pehle hi ek kyon nahin ho gaye
 That is, the question of going with the Congress and NCP by compromising with ideology is being raised towards the Shiv Sena, on which Bal Thackeray had once expressed his opinion in very clear words and called it a hoax with the public
 baharhaal, maharashtra main tamaam raajnneetik khinchataan ke bich aaj har koi bala sahib thakare ko yaad kar shradhanjali de rahaa he

 bharti kaa kahana he ki lalu yadav ke uksaane par argedy ke kuch kaaryakartaaon ne unke ghar ke daravaaje ke baahar budhi gaay ko baandh diya
 According to Bharti, when she protested, she was beaten up

 The Hajipur court, accepting the complaint filed on behalf of Bharti, has fixed the next hearing in the matter on May 19
 bharti ne apni yachika main lalu yadav ko sajeeshkarta bataate hue aaropee banaaya he
 According to Bharti, when he was sitting at home at night, RJD supporters took an old cow to his door and tried to tie it there
 jab manaa kiya to galigalouj or marpet karne lage
 But the other side of the coin is that the politics of cow is undoubtedly being exaggerated, but it is being told that the old man who was tied at the door of Bharati, drove him away
 darasal katahara ke argedy kaaryakarta dev prasad yadav ne apni budhi gaay ko bharti ke daravaaje par baandha tha
 Dev Prasad took the cow back to his home

 Dev Prasad Yadav and RJD activists are describing themselves as true Gosevaks

 According to Dev Prasad, who used to make big claims of cow service and defense, they could not keep the old cow for even 10-12 hours and drove away
 ab ulataa ham par hi cese kar diya he
 However, some RJDK workers were also seen trying to convince Bharti to withdraw the criminal case filed against Lalu Yadav
 argedy kaaryakarta sanjay kumaar yadav kaa kahana tha ki ye gaanv kaa maamla he isamen lalu yadav ko nahin jodna chahie tha

 ' The investigative website Gulel has released a picture of bjp's PM in waiting Narendra Modi with a woman
 gulel kaa daawa he ki ye vahi maadhuri (badla hua naam) naam kii mahila he, jisaki jasusi karne kaa aarope gujarat ke purv grih mantri or modi ke kareebi amit shah par laga tha
 Let us tell you that earlier, Gulel had released excerpts of tapes of senior Gujarat police officers Girish l Singhal and Amit Shah
 tepe ke mutabik shah apane 'sahib' ke kehane par singhl se ek mahila architect maadhuri kii jasusi karvaa rahe the
 However these tapes could not reveal the identity of Saheb
 gulel ne guuruuvaar ko darjanabhar tasviren jari kii hai
 These pictures are of the Kutch Autumn Festival of October 2005
 in tasveeron main modi ek mahila ke saath dikh rahe hai, jiskaa cheharaa chipa diya gaya he
 In one of these pictures, controversial IAS officer Pradeep Sharma is also present and the woman is standing with both of them
 website dwaara jari kiye tepe ke mutabik katha kuch is prakaar he
 Throughout August and September 2009, Singhal and his seven subordinates kept a close watch on the activities of 35-year-old architect 'madhuri' Soni (not real name), who works in Ahmedabad and Bhuj
 uske pita 63 varshiya pranalal soni bhuj ke saraaf bazaar main kuccha kii sabase nami jevaraat kii dukaan 'narbheram raamji jewelers' chalaate the
 He played an active role in the reconstruction of Saraf Bazar after the 2001 earthquake along with the then District Magistrate Pradeep Sharma
 teen saal baad modi ne nae bazaar kaa udghaatan kiya
 According to sources, Sony's sons-38-year-old Chintan and 29-year-old Harit opened Ecolibrium Energy, an energy saving company in Bangalore in 2008, with Madhuri as a director
 is company kaa gujarat sarkaar se qaraar tha
 Pranlal was close to Soni Modi
 modi 2010 main kencevilla gold club main ahmedabad ke ek vyapaaree ke saath 'maadhuri' kii shaadi main bhi pahunche the
 According to the tape, Shah also asked Singhal to increase the spying of Pradeep Sharma, who then became the corporation commissioner of Bhavnagar
 jasusi main maadhuri kaa peechha karne ke alaava uske kol record ko bhi khangaalana tha
 For about 62 days, Singhal and his team kept reporting on where she went, whom she met and why
 uskaa peechha pulisavaale car or motor cycle se hawaii adde, hotel, shopping mal, gym har jagah karte rahe
 Mobile metadata was investigated to detect its movements
 yani vah kab kahaan he, kitne kol use aae, kisase kitni der baat hui, vagairah
 On one occasion, a policeman was boarded on a flight from Ahmedabad to Mumbai
 modi kii team is jasusi kaa do tarah se bachaav karti he
 They say that Soni and her daughter themselves do not want to investigate the espionage case, then what is the problem? Her second defense is that the woman's father wanted the safety of her daughter and believed that she was having an 'illegitimate' relationship with the already married Pradeep Sharma
 website ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha he, 'ye tasviren mahila ke pita premlaal soni or bijepi kii safai par gambhir sawaal uthaati hai ki soni or modi puraane parichit hai or soni ne hi modi ko 2009 main apni beti kaa dhyaan rakhane ko kaha tha
 These photographs show that Modi had known Madhuri for at least five years before being illegally spied
 isse yah bhi sabit hota he ki pradeep sharma ne supreme court main jo afidavit daakhil kiya he ki maadhuri oktober 2005 main sharad utsav ke dauraan modi se mili thim, sahi he
 Sharma was the Collector of Kutch from 2003 to 2005
 'aapako bataa den ki modi sarkaar pradeep sharma ko 2003 se 2010 ke bich kuccha ke colector ke rup main jameen saudon ke paanch maamalon main bhrashtachar ke aarope main nilambit kar chuki he
 He was arrested in 2010 and released on bail a year later
 ve ab bhi nilambit hai
 In an affidavit in the Supreme Court in April 2011, Pradeep Sharma had said that he had introduced Madhuri to Modi
 baad main modi or maadhuri ke bich massej or i-mail hone lage
 He has stated that since he was aware of the closeness between the two, he was charged with embezzlement

 Sridevi is making her comeback to films after 15 years with 'english Vinglish' and Gauri Shinde is making her directorial debut
 'english winglish' kahani he ek gruhani shashi godbhole (shridevi) kii jo apane pati or bacchon ke saath ek khushhaal jindagi bitaa rahi he
 Along with taking care of the house, Shashi also does the business of making laddus, but there is only one shortcoming in Shashi's life
 
 
 unhen angreji nahin aati, jisaki vajah se kai baar unke pati or bachche unka mazaaq udaate hai
 As a result, she feels humiliated
 yahi he is film kii kahani kii neenv


aage kii kahani main nahin bataaungaa, lekin yah zarur kahuunga ki shridevi ne dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii he
 Sridevi has an excellent performance in the film
 kahani saadhaaran he, par film main kai khubasurat moments hai
 This is the direction of Gauri Shinde, which transformed a simple story into a good film
 tippaniyan All the tenants are well placed in their place, but the excellent performance of French actor Mehdi Nebbou has further enhanced the tenure of Sridevi
 amitabh bachchan kii guest apiyarence chehre par muskaan le aati he
 Very easily, the director also gave the message that language is necessary, but not so much that it appeals to the emotions
 yah sandesh aapako mehadi or shridevi ke saath filmaae gaye kai seens main milegaa
 Now talk of some shortcomings
 
 
 aaj kii 'fast pes' or 'glouci' filmon ke mukaable is film kii raftaar thodi dhimi he
 Secondly, the role of Sridevi's daughter in the film seemed a bit awkward, as children of this age in India cannot behave with their mother so rudely as shown in the film
 climex seen ko thodaa or damdaar banane kii zarurat thi, par kul milakar ek acchhee paariwarik film
 
 
 My rating for this is 3 stars
 
 
 ghar kii dekharekh ke saath shashi laddu banane kaa said bijnes bhi karti hai, lekin shashi kii zindagi main bas ek hi kami he
 
 
 She does not know English, due to which many times her husband and children make fun of her
 iske chalate vah apamaanit mahasoos karti he
 This is the foundation of the story of this film


 i will not tell the story ahead, but it will definitely say that Sridevi has made a comeback
 film main shridevi kii behtareen paraformens he
 The story is simple, but the film has many beautiful moments
 yah gauri scindia kaa direction hi he, jisane ek saadhaaran si kahani ko ek acchhee film main tabdeel kar diya
 The comments sabhi qirdaar apni jagah par bakhubi janche hai, par french actor mehadi nebbou ke behtareen abhinay ne shridevi ke qirdaar ko or nikharaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan's guest appearance brings a smile to his face
 badi aasaani se nirdeshak ne yah sandesh bhi de diya ki bhashaa zaruri he, lekin itani nahin ki vah bhaawanaaon ko mohataaj banaae
 You will find this message in many scenes filmed with Mehdi and Sridevi
 ab baat kuch khaamiyon kii
 
 
 Compared to today's 'fast Pace' and 'glossy' films, the speed of this film is a bit slower
 doosraa, film main shridevi kii beti kaa qirdaar thodaa atapata laga, kyonki hindustan main is umr ke bachche apni maa se itnaa abhadra vyavhaar nahin kar sakate, jaisaa film main dikhaaya gaya he
 The climax scene needed to be a bit more compelling, but overall a good family film
 
 
 iske liye meri reating he 3 star

 Amitabh Bachchan's guest appearance brings a smile to his face
 badi aasaani se nirdeshak ne yah sandesh bhi de diya ki bhashaa zaruri he, lekin itani nahin ki vah bhaawanaaon ko mohataaj banaae
 You will find this message in many scenes filmed with Mehdi and Sridevi
 ab baat kuch khaamiyon kii
 
 
 Compared to today's 'fast Pace' and 'glossy' films, the speed of this film is a bit slower
 doosraa, film main shridevi kii beti kaa qirdaar thodaa atapata laga, kyonki hindustan main is umr ke bachche apni maa se itnaa abhadra vyavhaar nahin kar sakate, jaisaa film main dikhaaya gaya he
 The climax scene needed to be a bit more compelling, but overall a good family film
 
 
 iske liye meri reating he 3 star
 
 
 All the tenants are well placed in their place, but the excellent performance of French actor Mehdi Nebbou has further enhanced the tenure of Sridevi
 amitabh bachchan kii guest apiyarence chehre par muskaan le aati he
 Very easily, the director also gave the message that language is necessary, but not so much that it appeals to the emotions
 yah sandesh aapako mehadi or shridevi ke saath filmaae gaye kai seens main milegaa
 Now talk of some shortcomings
 
 
 aaj kii 'fast pes' or 'glouci' filmon ke mukaable is film kii raftaar thodi dhimi he
 Secondly, the role of Sridevi's daughter in the film seemed a bit awkward, as children of this age in India cannot behave with their mother so rudely as shown in the film
 climex seen ko thodaa or damdaar banane kii zarurat thi, par kul milakar ek acchhee paariwarik film
 
 
 My rating for this is 3 stars

 This information is given in an investigation report

 Mishra said that after the fault, he called an emergency meeting of technical personnel and asked to report till today
 isse pehle bhaajapa ne blike out kii ninda karte hue aaj subah apni sansadeey dal kii baithak main iske khilaaf ek prastaav paarit kiya
 The BJP Parliamentary Party said that the black out was well planned and that it was not a technical flaw as claimed by the Lok Sabha Secretariat yesterday
 laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main hui baithak main maang kii gayi ki jab vidheyak par rajyasabha main charchaa ho rahi ho, kaarywahi kaa sidhaa prasaaran avashya hona chahie

 Seeing what happened after this, a wave of happiness ran in the supporters of Team India for a moment, but the next moment everyone was disappointed
 darasal, toss kaa sikaa uchhla, viraat kohli ne head kol kiya lekin tail aayaa
 Despite this, the plain English commentator Mark Nicholas said that India has won the toss, that is, India has won the toss
 haalanki, isse pehle ki kuch or hota kohli nicholas kii baat ko sahi karte hue kaha maine nahin phalf ne toss jeeta he
 Only then did Nicholas correct his mistake and who won the toss was officially announced

 On Monday, Delhi's jantar-mantaparatrunmool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee lashed out against the central government
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar sudhaaron kii aad main desh ko videshi haathon main bech rahi he
 He said that i do not have the greed for power so i withdrew support from the scammer and dishonest government
 ham log aam aadmi kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 Mamta accused the central government that the government was trying to disrupt her rally
 unhone kaha, 'aakhir sarkaar ko hamaari reliyon se itnaa dar kyon lagata he? itnaa hi nahin centre sarkaar pashchim bengal main bhi hamaari sarkaar ko asthir karnaa chaahati he
 Addressing the rally, he said, "now our movement will run across the country
 ham uttar pradesh, bihar, urisa se lekar rajasthan tak har rajya main jaaenge
 This government is working against the federal structure
 'mamata ne elaan kiya ki aagaamee satr main unki party centre sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laaegi
 He also announced that a federal front would also be tried
 isse pehle tiemasi saansadon ne bhi centre ko jamkar kosa
 Party MP Sudeep Bandopadhyay said that the decisions taken by the central government in the name of economic reforms are anti-people
 tiemasi saansad sugata roy ne kaha ki retail main epadiai laane se berogari badhegi
 He said that TMC would continue its protest against these decisions of the government
 centre sarkaar ke virodh main tiemasi kii raily main sharad yadav bhi pahunche
 Significantly, Mamata is upset with the government's decision to hike diesel prices, limit the number of subsidized LPG cylinders and approve foreign investment in retail
 is masale par unhone centre sarkaar se apana samarthan bhi waapas le liya tha
 Pakistan Defense Minister Chaudhary Ahmed Mukhtar has said that Pakistan cannot match India in this matter, in view of the increase in Indian military power and the induction of modern weapons into the army
 mukhtaar ne kaha, ‘‘agar ham sirf sainya tareeke se unki (bharat) barabari karne or unke paas jo astr-shastr hai, unki khariddaari karne kii koshish karen to ham aisa karne main sakasham nahin ho paaenge
 Explaining this claim, he said that India's economy is six to seven times larger than Pakistan's and India's trade size is also five to six times larger than Pakistan's
 ek saakshaatkaar main mukhtaar ne kaha ‘‘bharat or pakistan ke bich 20 se 22 dinon kii ladaai kii kshamta he
 Now that India has included too much arms, it can last for 45 days, but we will not be able to do so
 ’’mukhtaar ne kaha ki 2008 ke mumbai hamalon ke kaaran rishton main ai talkhi ko dur karne ke liye donon desh kadam uthaa rahe hai
 He said, "gradually the phase of meetings has started
 log seemapar aa-ja rahe hai
 Nobody ever thought that they would go to Amritsar via Wagah with a suitcase in hand, but this is now the truth and it is happening
 ’’jab unase poocha gaya ki jab bhi donon deshon ke rishton main sudhaar hota he to mumbai hamale jaisi ghatnaayen kyon hoti hai to unhone kaha ‘‘yah bahut du:khad he ki is tarah kii ghatnaayen hoti hai or aisa nahin hona chahie lekin kuch aise tatv hai jo in hamalon ke peeche hai
 He did not give any details about the elements responsible for the attacks but said that some of them have been arrested and are being prosecuted
 donon deshon ke bich rishton main sudhaar kii sambhaavna par unhone kaha, ‘‘jab bhi ham nirnay lenge ki dharm or raajnneeti ko milaayaa nahin janaa chahie to sthiti main sudhaar hoga

 The state government says that there are many flaws in this notification of the central government

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been accused by its opponents that it is going to ban beef in this area too

 Both leaders cited that beef is part of their culture and tradition and that bjp's ideology about beef was not acceptable to them

 In the Kartarpur Sahab case, BJP attacked again on Tuesday on the hug of the Pakistan Army Chief, Navjot Singh Siddhupar
 party ke pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha ki siddhu ne desh ko nicha dikhaane kaa kaam kiya he jo ki chintaa kii baat he, dukh kii baat he
 Patra said, repeated lies do not become true
 yahi kamanvajot singh siddhukar rahe hai
 Navjot Singh Sidhu went to Pakistan as a former cricketer
 unhone jo videsh mantralay se ijaajat lee thi, vah purv cricketer ke naate lee thi na ki raajnneeti chhot mili thi unako
 Patra said in a press conference, Navjot Singh Sidhu himself had told Sushma Swaraj that he was going there as a former cricketer
 iske jawaab main sushamaa swaraj ne teen baaten siddhu ko kahi thim
 One, never be hyper there
 do-desh kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karnaa or teen ki laut ke hindustan hi aana he, is baat ko hameshaa dhyaan rakhana lekin navjot singh siddhu ne in sab baton kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Patra said that the manner in which Sidhu behaved in Pakistan has served to degrade India
 siddhu ne vahaan ke army chif bajva ko gale lagaaya or apni galatiyon ko siddh karne ke liye baar-baar jhooth kaa sahaara le rahe hai or pakistan ke saath vah paralar diplomasi chalaa rahe hai
 Sambit Patra said that Sushma Swaraj has expressed displeasure over Sidhu's behavior
 bijepi kaa kahana he kikartarpursahab ko lekar sabhi sarkaron ne pakistan ke saath mudda uthaaya he
 But Pakistan never gave any answer
 bijepi pravaktaa ne siddhu par hamalaa tej karte hue kaha ki ve pakistan ke haq main bol rahe hai
 It has become his habit to speak against the country
 paatra ne poocha ki kiski anumati se navjot singh siddhu press conference kar rahe hai
 The BJP spokesperson also said that Sidhu, without permission of Binarahul Gandhi, cannot speak such things, so the Congress President himself should give clarification in this matter

 If the Bassi would have been suspended, your leader Ashutosh said that had there been any other government, Bassi would have been suspended or transferred due to a lapse in security
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi aarope lagaae
 He said - He is upset because the flyover for which 250 crore rupees was given, Kejriwal completed it for 150 crores and saved 100 crores
 If there had been another government at the centre,the police commissioner Bassi would have been suspended or transferred for security laps

 Challenge to BJP cms to do like this! - ashutosh (@ ashutosh83b) January 18, 2016 Accusation- Security was not given even in Punjab
 Ashutosh alleged that Kejriwal was not given protection even in Muktsar, Punjab

 There was a Punjab Police team, but there was no Delhi Police team

 He went to Muktsar on 14 January
 naa jane desh kii rajdhani dilli kii police ko kya ho gaya he
 In the coming days, some area of delhi starts echoing with the sound of gunfire
 aae din badmaash saream kisi kii bhi hatya karke sansani failaa dete hai
 Gangs are taking place on the streets of Delhi
 lekin dilli police vaardaat hone ke baad aati he or aropiyon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchane kaa daawa karne lagati he
 But the culprits are freshly elevated
 taaja maamla meet nagar kaa he
 Where a bodybuilder was roasted with bullets
 abaki baar badmaashon ne uttar purvi dilli main koharaam machaaya
 a bodybuilder named Govind was gunned down in Meet Nagar area
 badmaashon ne pehle us par andhadhundh goliyaan chalaai or phir use chaaku se bhi god daalaa
 It seemed that the murderers did not want to leave Govind alive under any circumstances
 puraa ilaaka goliyon kii awaz gunj uthaa
 During this time, a passer-by who passed through there was also shot in the attack and died
 us rahgeer kii pahchaan akaash ke rup me hui
 Govind and Akash died on the spot
 hamalavar vahaan se bhaag nikle
 Govind and Akash continued to suffer on the road
 kisi ne unki madad nahin kii
 However, some people did make a video of the attackers from their mobiles
 police maukey par pahunchi or donon shav kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej die gaye
 Govind's family told the police that Matru Lala, who lives near his house, along with Avnish and his other companions murdered their son Govind
 parijanon ke anusaar kaatilon ne pehle govind ko 4-5 goliyaan maari or phir use kai baar chaakuon se god daalaa
 Police began investigation
 hatya kii vajah puraani ranjish nikali
 The police came to know that the killers were following Govind at the time of the incident
 mauka pate hi unhone use goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Govind, a 26-year-old bodybuilder, was preparing for competition
 uske pita ek kaarobaari hai
 The elder brother is an engineer in a Delhi company
 jabaki uski choti bahan abhi padhai kar rahi he
 According to the family of Govind, he had also won the title of Mr
 Delhi and Mr
 Bihar
 govind kaa sapana international body builder banane kaa tha
 Since the incident, the police was engaged in trying to solve the murder
 police ko namjad shikaayat mil chuki thi
 Now the police was searching for the accused
 isi dauraan police ko aropiyon ke bare main ahm jaankaree mili
 And on the basis of that information, the police arrested the three accused
 jinaki pahchaan aman, ankit or aashu ke rup main hui he
 The mastermind of the murder is Anil alias Lala, who has been absconding with his family since the attack
 police ko pataa chalaa ki us din aaropee anil urf lala ne apane ghar main saathiyon ke saath sharaab party kii thi
 And then together with them, this incident was carried out
 anil ne apane saathiyon se kaha tha ki govind kaa kaam tamaam karnaa he or wo kisi bhi haalat main bachanaa nahin chahie
 Police found out that Anil, the mastermind of the attack, first shot at Govind's neck and other accomplices with him also opened fire on him
 puraa ilaaka goliyon kii tadtadaahat se gunj rahaa tha
 Police has formed 7 special teams to apprehend the accused
 ab police baaqi aropiyon kii talash kar rahi he
 But once again this incident has blown the claims of Delhi Police
