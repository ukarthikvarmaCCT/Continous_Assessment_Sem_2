 modi cabinet ke pherbadal main jediu ke kisi netaa ko mantri na banaae jane par lalu prasad yadav bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kii khub mouj le rahe hai
 RJD leader Lalu Prasad attacked Nitish a lot after tweeting after the swearing-in ceremony
 unhone twit kar kaha ki do naav par sawari karne vaale mushkil main hi funsate hai or jhund se alag ho chuke bandar ko koi nahin poochta
 It was clear on Sunday morning that Nitish Kumar's party JDU would not be included in the Modi cabinet
 bataaya jaataa he ki jediu mantrimandal vistaar ko lekar bijepi ke rukh se khush nahin he
 It was reported from BJP that JDU has agreed to the proposal of a cabinet minister and a minister of state
 lekin shanivaar kii dopaher tak mantriyon kii sankhya or portpholio ko lekar bijepi or jediu ke bich khinchataan jari rahi
 The complication of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah was that Shiv Sena has more Lok Sabha mps than JDU
 or kendriya cabinet main party kii ore se ekmaatr sadsy anant geete baari udyog mantri hai
 In such a situation, giving two ministers to the JDU could have offended the Shiv Sena
 sutron ke mutabik jo ofer bijepi kii taraf se nitish kumaar ko diya gaya he usase vah santusht nahin the
 After this, Lalu Prasad Yadav got the opportunity to attack Nitish Kumar
 haal main nitish dwaara paala badalakar bijepi ke saath chale jane se puraa yadav parivaar kaaphi kupit he, aise main vah nitish par hamale kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte
 Lalu was the first to tweet after the swearing - no one asks the monkey after wandering from the herd

Will buffalo give more milk than changing pagoda? - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) September 3, 2017 Message clear Tejashwi Yadav, the son of Bossaloo, also did not miss the opportunity to enjoy Nitish's pleasure

 His response comes after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote a letter to Anna Hazare that the government would take steps for electoral reforms
 kuraishi ne kaha, "hamaara mukhya dar yah he ki yadi ham sabhi ummidavaaron ko nakaarna shuru kar dete hai to hamen phir se chunaav karana hoga, jabaki log pehle hi chunaav main hone vaale kharch ke boj tale dabe hai
 "opposing the right to recall the people's representatives, which is in many developed countries," he said that this would bring 'instability' in the country, especially in areas which are already isolated
 ummidavaaron ko khaarij karne ke adhikaar ke sambandh main kuraishi ne kaha ki nirvachan ayog ne haalanki matadaataaon kaa asantosh jaahir karne ke liye iviem main 49-o batan shaamil karne kaa samarthan kiya he, lekin is prastaav se aksar chunaav kii sambhaavna bani rahegi
 According to the rules, if the voter decides not to vote, he can select 49-O
 anna hajaare ne yah kehete hue iskaa samarthan kiya he ki chunaav main karodon rupee kharch karne vaale ummidavaaron ko yadi khaarij kiya jaataa he to ve isse hatotsahit honge
 Qureshi said that he will meet Anna Hazare this month on this issue

 It's been a month since i witnessed the most peaceful evening
 It's been a month since i realised once again that i love sunsets more, And it's been a month since i understood that a trip gives us an opportunity to know a known person in a better way
 And each day, i spent a few minutes to see the pictures, again and again
 Each day, i closed my eyes and saw a glimpse of that beautiful evening, Each day, i took a deep breath to remember the mesmerising boat ride, And each day, i reminded myself to keep calm and smilingly overcome the inner struggles, because there are many more sunsets to watch
 🙂❤

 Revenue department officials said that the government has increased the circle rates because in most cases the actual price of the property is not shown, causing a huge loss of revenue in the stamp duty and registration fee
 adhikariyon ne kaha, ‘ham property saudon main kaale dhan ke istemaal ko rokna chaahate hai or saath hi rajasav badhanaa chaahate hai
 Chief Minister Dixit said that the government has also decided to revise the circle rates after a gap of every two years

 unhone kaha ki in diggajon se acting ke alaava bahut kuch seekhney ko mila
 Nawazuddin said that he has never seen these stars as an actor but as a person who has achieved a lot in his life

 Apart from this, he also appeared in the film 'talaash' opposite Aamir Khan and will now be seen in the film Raees alongside Shah Rukh Khan

 shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke 'main bhi chaukeedaar' campan par bolte hue kaha ki ve chaukeedaar nahin shivasainik hai
 In an interview with senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, Uddhav Thackeray also said that he is not a supporter of Congress Mukt Bharat
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi har chunavi raily main congress mukt bharat kii baat karte hai or congress par khaase hamalavar rahete hai
 After lakhs of appeals, Shiv Sena and BJP are determined to contest elections under the National Democratic Alliance once again
 uddhav thakare ne kaha, 'mujhe chaukeedaar hone kii jarurat nahin he
 i am a born Shiv Sainik
 isliye main shivasainik hi rahoonga
 i do not work for the Congress Free Agenda
 pradhanmantri ko paanch saal or dene honge
 i will visit the Ram temple once again in Ayodhya if the construction of the Ram temple is not accelerated
 'uddhav thakare kaa yah bayaan tab saamne aayaa he jab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke namakan main ve ek din pehle hi gandhinagar, gujarat gaye the
 The rally was also considered to be a show of strength by the NDA
 shivasena pramukh ke is bayaan ke baad log hairat main hai
 This interview can also be seen in such a way that Uddhav Thackeray had to clarify his opinion, hence interviewed Sanjay Raut
 saamana unki hi party kaa mukhyapatr he
 Uddhav Thackeray has not given any interview to anyone in recent times
 uddhav thakare ko is baat kaa andaja he ki agar media ko ve intervyuu dete hai to unhen behad kathin sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 This alliance of Shiv Sena and BJP was not easy
 is gathbandhan ke liye amit shah ko pahal kerani padi thi
 Earlier, Shiv Sena had announced that it would contest alone all the seats in Maharashtra
 chunaav se pehle haalanki maamla bijepi or congress ke bich kaaphi had tak sulajh gaya tha
 Uddhav Thackeray did not answer any media questions in the press conference that followed
 iske baad bhi shivasena bijepi kii nitiyon ke khilaaf kuch din tak hamalavar rahi
 In the current political climate, PM Modi's distance from the campaign and the Congress not wanting a free India are pointing to disagreements before the election
 uddhav thakare kaa sanjay raut ko diya gaya yah intervyuu mangalvaar ko jari ho sakegaa lekin usase pehle aaj tak ko intervyuu kaa promo video mil gaya jisamen uddhav thakare ne kai ahm sawaalon ke jawaab die
 It will be a matter of what Uddhav Thackeray talks throughout the interview
 lekin logon ko khaas dilchaspee tab hoti jab uddhav sidhe taur par media se baatcheet karne ke liye aage aate or jawaab dete

 kanoon or tark ke ajeeb doraahe par khadey bharat main rahane vaale sabhi logon ke saamne achaanak apni naagarikta sabit karne kii chunauti aa khadi hui he
 This was never the case before, even at the time of independence, partition, merger of princely states and creation of constitution
 desh nirmaan ke vakt bharat main rahane vaale yaa yahaan janme yaa jinke mata-pita kaa yahaan janm hua ho yaa jo samvidhan lagu hone se pehle kam se kam paanch saal se bharat main nivas kar rahe the, aise har shaks kii naagarikta bhartiya thi
 At that point of history, both our land and the public had to create a new identity
 samvidhan sabha ne naagarikta ke nirdhaaran kaa faisla sansad par chhod diya jo tab aakaar le rahi thi
 The first general election was held in 1952, three years before the Citizenship Act, 1955 came into force
 kanoonee taur par un logon ko 'bhartiya mul' kaa mana gaya jinka janm yaa jinke mata-pita yaa dada-daadi kaa janm avibhajit bharat main hua tha
 All persons of Indian origin who entered Assam before January 1, 1966 and "who had lived there since the time they entered Assam" were considered citizens of India
 jo log 1 janvari, 1966 or 25 march, 1971 ke bich assam aae or vahiin rahane lage, unhen videshi adhinium 1946 or videshi (tribunel) aadesh 1964 ke anusaar 'videshi' mana gaya
 They could register themselves and become citizens in 10 years
 antarim avadhi main vot dene kaa adhikaar chhodkar unke paas samaan naagarik adhikaar hote jisamen passport praapt karne kaa adhikaar bhi shaamil he
 They got the right to vote only after getting citizenship after 10 years
 2003 main avaidh pravaasiyon ke sambandh main nai daleel saamne ai jab naagarikta or unke nivas sthaan se sambandhit vichaaron main kuch moulik parivartan karne ke liye naagarikta adhinium main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 The first rule of this amendment was that if a child's parents were Indians, the child would automatically get Indian citizenship
 2003 ke sanshodhan main shart rakhi gai ki ab bachche ko janm ke baad khud-ba-khud ''naagarikta'' usee sthiti main milegi jab uske janm ke samay uske mata yaa pita main se koi bhi 'avaidh pravasi' na hon
 Surprisingly, in this amendment special status has been given to 'foreign nationals' whose descendants could have become citizens of India at the time of the constitution coming into force, but they had chosen citizenship of another country
 vaise yah suvidha bangladesh (tab purvi pakistan) yaa pakistan ke nagarikon ko nahin di gai he
 The 2003 amendment also introduced the provision to prepare the National Register of Citizens (NRC)
 enarasi ke pehle kadam ke taur par neshnal population register kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya jise i-gavarnence kaa bazaar taiyaar karne waalon ne turant mishan mod project ke rup main apanaakar praudyogiki or prashasan ke naam par chatur rajnatik khel rachaaya jo bhartiya naagarikta ke vichaar ko chunauti de rahaa tha, saath hi citijan data ko phaayde kaa saamaan bana rahaa tha
 This did not create any hue and cry, as the questioning of the identity of the suspects is considered a smooth process, but one could not imagine that someday the challenge of proving their citizenship to an entire population
 It will be done
 chunki enarasi 2013 main assam main shuru hua tha, or supreme court ne baadh, avaidh pravasi or 'baahar se aae log' jaise shabdon kaa zikr kiya, to isse sthiti ne nai karavat le lee
 In the last six years, every person in Assam has to prove his citizenship through documents-legacy documents (eg land records, court cases, birth certificates, school or university certificates) and genealogy documents
 (apane purvajon ke saath sambandhon ke saboot dene pad rahe hai jo bharat ke naagarik the)
 Women, who have migrated to some other place after marriage and the poorer section have to struggle hard to prove their identity
 dastavejon main bemail tathyon or galatiyon ne to maano tabaahi hi machaa di he
 The government register on which verification of documents depends is a big task to maintain, as they not only face long intervals of time, but also face disasters like fire and flood
 is prakriya par abhi sarvocch nyaayalay kaa niyantran he
 NRC Co-ordinator Pratik Hazela sent the relevant information directly to the court in a very special 'sealed envelope'
 (adaalat ne ab centre se unhen madhya pradesh main inter-cader sthanantarit karne ke liye kaha he)
 It is not known when the envelope will be opened
 isliye philhal ham nahin jaan sakate hai ki usamen kya he or adaalat ke adeshon kaa aadhaar kya he
 The entire process seems to be focused on Assam and the Supreme Court had full powers to implement NRC in Assam
 aisi koi ummid nahin dikhti ki yah bhuuchaal naagarikta ke sawaalon ko sulajhaa degaa
 People's guess turned out to be incorrect that the majority of the people to be shortlisted would be Bangladeshi Muslims
 khud assam ke mul nivaasiyon ne maang kii he ki unki naagarikta ko manyata mili
 The Bharatiya Gorkha Confederation, a national group working for the interest of Gorkhas settled in India, has announced that more than 100,000 Gorkhas excluded from the list will not take their case to foreign tribunals, but rather they will grant citizenship to Gorkhas and Nepali speaking people

 yani sirf musalamaanon ko avaidh naagarik kii shrenee main dhakel diya jayega
 There is no means by which such a provision can be made constitutional by reading the Constitution
 lekin isse pehle ki adaalat isaki sanvaidhaniktaa par vichaar kar koi aadesh paarit kare, aabaadi ko pun: sanyojit kiya ja saktaa he or ek upyukt tark gadha ja saktaa he
 "after the CAB (citizenship Amendment Bill) is passed, the detention centers in Assam will be closed for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Christians," said Himanta Biswa Sarma, the prominent BJP leader of the Northeast
 aabaadi ke anya samooh ke sambandh main faisla adaalat ko lenaa hoga
 The detention centers are set up not by the will of the state government, but because of a court order
 '' yah dhokhaa he, kyonki adaalat kaa aadesh sirf musalamaanon ko hiraasat kendron main rakhane kaa nahin tha
 In other parts of the country, there is a terrible wave of Muslims being declared 'non'
 karnataka main police ne kathith taur par nau bacchon sahit kareeb 60 musalamaanon ko apravasi bangladeshi kaa aarope lagaate hue uthaaya
 He had suitable documents including voter ID cards and uids, but was labeled as fake because his bid was Bengali
 aisa silsilaa shuru hua to har shaks prashasan kii sanak or siyaasi mahatvakanksha kaa shikaar banane lagegaa
 India has rejected the concern of the UN Special Envoy on the issue of the impact on minorities from this wave, but it is not embracing what is happening at the ground level
 avaidh pravasi hone ke nattejey kya hai? hiraasat
 Apart from Assam, construction of detention centers has started in Maharashtra and Karnataka
 koi bhi kanoon is sambhavit samuhik utpeeda par vichaar nahin kar rahaa
 Out of state, stateless
 naagarikta nahin milanaa
 This will affect every person whose citizenship will not be recognized
 isamen ve bhi shaamil honge jinaki raksha karne kaa vaada sarkaar ne kiya he
 That is, all but Muslims
 lekin jinhen sarkari suraksha mili he, unhen bhi is kavayad kaa khamiyaja bhugatna hoga, kyonki ve naagarikta ke visheshadhikaron ko agle paanch saal tak istemaal nahin kar sakate
 After that they can become citizens depending on the status of the law
 pramukh vishay jo ubhar rahaa he, vah naagarikta kaa nahin he, balki satta main baithe logon ke vichaaron ke hisaab se pun:sanyojit kii ja rahi aabaadi kaa he
 It is reminiscent of Bertolt Brecht's poem The Solution (1953)
 unhone kaha tha ki janata ne sarkaar ke aatmavishvaas ko hilaa diya he jo sirf doguna prayaason se hi dobaaraa jeeta ja saktaa he

 vah gudgaanv ke municipal korporation ke daftar apana janm pramaan patr banavaane gaye the
 There, he was asked to get an affidavit signed by the midwife who had delivered her mother
 iske alaava do padosiyon ke bhi dastakhat hon, jo us samay yani 1949 main unke pados main rahete rahe hon
 The midwife who had delivered the child was more than 40 years old at the time of the birth of Madan Lal Jain in 1949
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar vah jinda he to vah 104 saal kii hogi
 Now Madan Lal has applied for a change in this law in the district court
 gudgaanv municipal korporation ke adhikariyon ne kaha he ki unke paas 1963 ke baad janm lene waalon ke hi record hai
 Whereas the administration in Delhi conducts police verification in such cases and it is on this basis that a birth certificate is made
 lekin madan laal ko aisa koi vikalp nahin diya gaya
 Madan Lal said, 'when i went to the Municipal Corporation office for a birth certificate, i was told that records are available only after 1963
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki main yaa to aspataal ke kagajaat pesh karun yaa dai ke sin vaala affidavit prastut karun jiske saath do padosiyon ke bhi sin hon jo 1949 main hamaare padosi the
 'madan Lal was born in his home in Gopal Nagar, Old Gurgaon
 unke paas janm pramaan patr se sambandhit ek kagajaat he or vah he punjab uniwarsity kii marksheet lekin adhirkariyon ne unase kaha ki yah vaid document nahin he jiske aadhaar par janm pramaan patr ban saktaa he
 Now Madan Lal has no choice but to wait for the court order
 6 disambar ko is maamle kii sunwaayee he
 If the decision comes in their favor, then many people like them who are waiting for the birth certificate will benefit

 BJP has got 18 seats and Congress has got two seats
 bijepi kii is jeet main mukul roy or bengal bijepi ke prabharee kailash vijayawargeey kaa bada role he
 In this election, tremendous results for the BJP came from West Bengal where it shed the sweat of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress
 aath saal se sattarudh trinmul ko amit shah ke netritv vaali bijepi ne sabase bada ulatpher dikhaaya
 Recently, Trinamool Congress suspended MLA Subhranshu Roy from the party for six years
 subhranshu kisi samay trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee ke kareebi rahe mukul roy ke bete hai
 Subhranshu was suspended for tarnishing the party's image
 loksabhaa chunaav se kaaphi samay pehle mukul roy trinmul congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the
 Lack of discipline within the party and not listening to the leaders are also considered as reasons for the split in Trinamool
 arjuna singh jaise log jo bijepi main shaamil ho gaye or ab saansad ban gaye hai, ve kabhi saansad bananaa chaahate the lekin trinmul ne unke naam par gaur nahin kiya, isliye unhone party chhod di
 There are other people who are feeling trapped in the Trinamool and are leaving the party
 mukul roy ko kai saal tak anya dalon ke netaaon ko trinmul main shaamil karaane ke liye janaa jaataa rahaa lekin ve ab bijepi main hai or trinmul ko todane ke kaam main lage hai
 Even after joining the BJP, he showed the same skill and inducted current Trinamool mps Anupam Hazra and Soumitra Khan along with many other leaders-activists
 unhone vampanthi dalon ke kuch netaaon ko bhi bijepi ke paksh main todaa
 Even though the raindrops can provide relief from the heat, the risk of getting skin and other diseases also increases in this season
 is mausam main twachaa kaa vishesh khyaal rakhana hota he
 There are many screen problems during the rainy season
 khujali, jalan or laal daag ban janaa saamaanya samasyaayein hai
 In this case, special care has to be taken of the skin
 agar aap bhi barsaat ke mausam main apni skin ko lekar pareshaan hai to ye upaay aapke liye bahut phydemand sabit honge
 1
 saaf-safai kaa puraa khyaal rakhen:barsaat ke mausam main zyaadaatar bimaariyaan gandagi kii vajah se hi failati hai
 In such a situation, it is important that you keep your hands, face and feet clean from time to time
 koshish karen ki din main do baar kisi achche phase wash se cheharaa saaf karen
 You can also use a waterproof proof cleaner if you want
 2
 Toning will also be beneficial
 During the rainy season, the moisture in the atmosphere is more
 aise main skin porce bhi block ho jate hai
 This often causes pimples
 aap chahen to koi acha anti-bacterial toner bhi istemaal kar sakati hai
 If you are afraid of using toner, then using rose water will also be beneficial for you
 3
 Do not forget to do moisturization
 Sometimes people feel that applying moisturizer in the rain will make the skin sticky but this is not the case
 barsaat main bhi twachaa ko poshan kii jarurat hoti hi he
 The skin becomes dry when wet with wet water in rainy season
 isse khujali or rashes ho jate hai
 In such a situation, do not leave a moisturizer
 aap chahen to oil-free moishcharizer yuj kar sakati hai
 4
 dry rahanaa bahut jaruri habarsaat ke mausam main ham aksar geele ho jate hai
 There is always a risk of infection
 koshish kiijie ki aapaki twachaa zyada der tak geeli na rahe
 Otherwise there may be fungal infection

 It is very hot when it is sunny after rain after escaping from the rain
 dhoop main nikalnaa ho to bina sanscreen lagaae nahin nikalen
 Sunscreen will protect the skin from ultra violet rays

 lekin buudhvaar ko gulabi shahar main vivaadit bol kaa bhoot unke sir maathe bhi chadhakar bolne laga
 Addressing police officers across the country in Jaipur, Rajnath Singh said that killing a vicious criminal brings happiness like marriage
 itnaa hi nahin, baat police kii gaali-galouj kii ai to grih mantri ne gaaliyon ko 'veda vaakya' kaa darja de diya
 It is also worth noting that this is the same Rajnath Singh, who recently talked about leaving politics when he was proved 'guilty' to keep himself and his family away from controversies

 Rajnath did not stop, when it came to the Maoists, the Home Minister said, 'when i was the CM of UP, Maoism was at its peak and the officers were being killed
 tab hamane saare adhikariyon ko bulaayaa
 Everyone said that one has to appear before the opposition party and human rights
 hamane kaha aap jaao maanavadhikaar kii chintaa mat karo maanavadhikaar se main nipatuunga
 Will take orders out of his pen if needed
 'abhi bhi rakhata hum vahi raidilachasp baat yah rahi ki kaarykram samaapt hone or manch se utarane ke baad bhi grih mantri ke tevar barkaraar the
 In such a situation, he was asked if he had the same opinion about the Human Rights Commission as the CM of UP
 rajnath singh ne kaha, 'bilkul meri ab bhi vahi raay he
 'the saffron brigade may also have objections, not only the opposition but also the saffron brigade of the country can also object to the controversial words of Rajnath
 darasal, rajnath ne apane sambodhan main police kii gaaliyon ko veda vaakya kii sangya de di
 He said, 'perception about the policemen is that they speak Ved sentences

 She said that Bhilai's Women's Conference is the biggest women's conference of my life
 shah ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki bhartiya janata party mahila shakti kaa sammaan karti he
 Targeting the CD scandal, Amit Shah said that Rahul Gandhi insults women
 garibon kii vednaa ve nahin samaj sakate hai
 He praised Raman Singh's government and said that the state government has done a lot of work in the development of Chhattisgarh
 pradesh ko naksal mukt karne kii disha main teji se kaam kiya gaya he
 Rahul Gandhi should clarify whether he is contesting elections under the leadership of those who insult the mother power of Chhattisgarh? We not only have to defeat the Congress in Chhattisgarh but have to take a pledge to overthrow the Congress party from the state so that this kind of dirty Politics could not flourish

 perth main patrkaar se badasluki maamle main bisisiai ne viraat kohli ko chetavanee di he
 The BCCI has said that the incident in Perth should not be repeated and the players should take care of the dignity
 viraat kohli par perth main ek patrkaar ke saath badasluki kaa aarope laga tha
 There is also news that the Hindustan Times newspaper has withdrawn its case against Kohli, whose journalist he misbehaved with
 patrkaar ne kohli kii badasluki kii shikaayat isisi or bisisiai donon se kii thi
 But now after the withdrawal of the case, this dispute is expected to calm down
 aapako bataa den ki viraat kohli apane or anoushka se judi ek khabar se naaraaz the, jisaki vajah se unhone patrkaar ko gaaliyaan di
 Although he also apologized after some time, the journalist put the entire incident in front of everyone through an article
 patrkaar ne bataaya ki kohli ne kai gaaliyaan di
 Not only this, Virat kept abusing him by pointing towards him for about 15 minutes
 is maamle main team manager ne bhale hi kah diya ho ki viraat ne gaali nahin di thi or maamla khatm ho chukaa he lekin patrkaar ne jis tarah se ghatnakram bayaan kiya he usase saaf he ki viraat ne aapa kho diya tha or unki jubaan se vaise hi gaaliyaan baras raheen thi jaise aajkal unke balle se ran baras rahe hai
 It is true that when Kohli was returning to the dressing room after practice in Perth on Tuesday, he found a journalist from a national daily standing in front of him
 patrkaar kuch samaj paata, isse pehle hi kohli ne gaaliyaan deni shuru kar deen
 This went on for about half an hour and some members of the Indian team were also surprised to see what Mazra was
 us patrkaar ko bhi pataa nahin tha ki aakhir kohli kyon aisa vyavhaar kar rahe hai, lekin jab kohli kaa gussa shant hua, to unhone kisi ko bataaya ki unke or anoushka sharma ke bare main rashtriya dainik main report chhapi thi or use laga ki yah report us patrkaar ne likhi thi
 When Kohli was told that he did not identify the journalist correctly, Kohli called a journalist and apologized for the incident through him

 Today he may not be present among us but he will always be among us in the form of his films
 rajkpur kii soch unki filmon ke rup main duniya ke saamne aa chuki he
 The film is the story of the country in which the Ganges flows, in the rebellious form of their pacifistic romanticism, while mainly Arawa, Shree 420 and Sangam explore aspects of human conscience
 rajkpur ne apni filmon main nari ko khaas tarjeeh di
 Whether it is Radha, the vortex of the love triangle in Sangam, the heartbreaking woman of the hero in Mera Naam Joker, a girl full of zeal to step on the threshold of youth in Bobby, or love sickness and Ram Teri Ganga dirty time And she was a woman of social evils and she made different forms of women in a new way
 rajkpur ne darshakon dwaara darshakon ke liy ke falsafe par amal kiya
 He once said that our people are very kind, they suffer every difficulty to go to the cinema, standing in long queues for a single ticket and waiting for their turn

 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main 11 rajyon main sookhe ke jo aankade pesh kiye, us par yogendra yadav ke sanghathan swaraj abhiyaan ne sawaal uthaae
 During the hearing on Tuesday, on behalf of the petitioner Swaraj Abhiyan, Prashant Bhushan told the court that according to the figures given by the government, more people are affected by the drought, according to Prashant Bhushan, '40 to 45 in drought-affected states Percent people are affected by drought
 yani kareeb 50 karod log sookhe se prabhavit hai
 'the government had told the court in the last hearing that about 33 crore people are affected by drought in 256 districts of 10 states
 kya kehete hai sarkari aankade?bhushan ne kaha, 'sarkari aankadonke hi mutabik bihar ke 15 jile aanshik rup se sookhe se prabhavit hai
 15 districts of Gujarat are partially affected by the drought and 3 districts are slightly affected
 jabaki haryana ke 8 jile aanshik rup se or 4 jile thode prabhavit hai
 "not even 50 days of employment is being provided under MNREGA", Prashant Bhushan alleged that both the Center and the state are manipulating the data regarding kissing

 loksabhaa siton ke lihaaj se desh kii sabase bade soobe main jis party kaa jhanda buland hota he, usee kii gunj dilli tak suni jaati he
 This is the reason why SP-BSP-RLD has formed an alliance to stop Narendra Modi's Vijay Rath in Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin, bijepi ne 2014 jaise nattejey dohraane or sapa-basapa-areldi ke sameekaran ko dhwast karne ke liye nai ranneeti apana rahi he
 Under this, instead of targeting coalition candidates in the state, BJP is taking a more aggressive stance against Muslim candidates of Congress
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko is ranneeti kaa bada siyaasi phayda mila tha
 The Congress has so far fielded 9 Muslim candidates in Uttar Pradesh
 saharanpur se imran masood, bijanour se nasimuddin siddiki, muradabad se imran pratapgadhi, badaayun se saleem sherwani, lakhimpur khiri se jafar ali nakvi, sitapur se kaisar jahaan, devaria se niaj ahamed, santakabeernagar parvej khan or farrukhabad se salmaan khurshid ko congress ne pratyaashee banaaya he
 bjp's new strategy is in the BJP province where the SP-BSP is vocal about the alliance
 vahiin, congress ne jin siton par muslim candidet utaare hai, vahaan, bijepi kii ranneeti puri tarah se badali hui najar aati he
 Here, bjp's star campaigners or party candidates are targeting Congress more than the alliance
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii ye sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 Please tell that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat said during the bjp's Vijay Sankalp Sabha, 'in Saharanpur too, Jaish-e Mohammed's terrorist, Masood Azhar has a son-in-law who speaks the language of the same, so you To decide whether to win the person speaking the language of the terrorist or Raghav Lakhanpal working as a fighter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 'haalanki siem yogi adityanath ne kisi kaa naam sidhe taur par nahin liya, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki unka yah bayaan saharanpur se congress pratyaashee imran masood ke liye tha
 Interestingly, Yogi did not comment on the candidate of the alliance on this seat
 isse saaf taur par bijepi kii ranneeti ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, senior journalist from Uttar Pradesh, Kashi Prasad, said that the large number of Muslims are standing in favor of the alliance candidates
 bijepi is baat ko bakhubi samajhati he
 This is the reason why it wants to create a situation of Confusion in Muslim votes by targeting Congress instead of coalition
 bijepi kii is ranneeti se sidhaa nuksaan gathbandhan ko or phayda bijepi ko mil saktaa he
 Kashi Prasad says that the SP-BSP alliance has its own strong vote bank
 congress kii sthiti pehle se majboot hui he, lekin maujuuda raajnneetik halaat main congress ke muslim ummidavaar apane dam par jitate hue najar nahin aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, the BJP wants that if the Muslim vote turns to the Congress instead of the coalition, it can benefit
 badaayun loksabhaa seat se bijepi pratyaashee sanghmitra maury bhi kah rahi hai ki unka muqabla gathbandhan ummidavaar dharmendra yadav ke bajaae congress ke saleem sherwani se hai
 Similarly, if you look at the BJP candidate in the other seats, it is clear that they are telling their competition not with the alliance but with the Congress
 jamaat-e-ulma-e-hind se jude mufti abdul raajik kehete hai ki bahut sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahate bijepi congress ke muslim pratyaashiyon ko target kar rahi he
 Although he says that this time Muslims are taking a lot of silence, but this changed strategy of BJP is also haunting Muslim votes
 dilachasp baat ye he ki congress ne jin siton par muslim pratyaashee ko utaara he
 There is not a single seat which can be won with the help of Muslim votes
 haalanki muslim matadaata in siton par badi sankhya main he, lekin itane bhi nahin kii jinke sahare unke sahare jeet kaa sehara bandha sake
 On the other hand, if we look at the political equation of the coalition, the Muslim voters along with the bsp's Dalit, sp's Yadav and rld's Jat voters come together, and for BJP, the road to victory seems thorny
 haalanki gathbandhan ke saamne apane votbank ko ekajute rakhane kii badi chunauti he

 kendriya rajya mantri upendra kushvaha ne patna main 'hallaa bol-darwaja khol' naam se ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya
 The main objective of this program was to demand the implementation of reservation in the judiciary
 is avasar par kai ritaryad jaj vakil or anya prabud log upasthit rahe
 At this event held in Patna, all the speakers raised fierce questions on the judicial system
 kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne kaha, 'jajon kii yogyata kaa sawaal ham nahin uthaa rahe hai
 But are the people who are sitting on that chair only eligible
 kya duusare log jo baahar hai wo yogya nahin he? duusare log unase bhi zyada yogya hai lekin duusare log vahaan jaae kaise? sawaal is baat kaa he ki aaj jo system or vyavastha he vah vyavastha yogya vidhyaarthiyon ke liye bahut badi baadha he
 Some people say that merit is being affected due to reservation but i say merit is being affected due to the system itself
 'unhone kaha ki samudr kinare machhlee markar parivaar chalaane vaale ke ghar se ek merit vaala vidhyaarthee nikalataa he or desh kaa raashtrapati ban jaataa he
 Not many such examples will be found

 Bollywood actress Bhumi Pednekar recently appeared in Ayushmann Khurrana's film Bala
 film main ve dark color kii mahila ke role main najar ai hai
 While Ayushmann appeared in the role of a bald person in the film
 bala ko darshak behad pasand kar rahe hai
 It shows how a person with short hair is mocked in society
 saath hi personal life kii baat karte hue bhoomi ne bataaya ki real life main unhen alag-alag kaarnon se buli kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The actress told that everyone has to face it
 main ye sab apane kariyar ke shuruyaat se hi phase karti ai hum
 As a child, i was fat and made fun of me

 If you are too small, or too big, if you have more hair, or less, how is your skin, people have problems with all these things
 iske aage bhoomi ne bataaya ki sirf personal life main nahin, profeshnal front par bhi unhen shuruyaat main kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 People say that people keep asking them different types of questions
 log meri filmon ke kirdaar ke bare main prashnchinh uthaate hai or jis tarah kii filmein main karti hum, waisi filmein naa karne kii salaah dete hai
 Talking about the pay scale given in films, Bhoomi says that in the early days of his career, it used to be a big problem
 main apni fees kii tulana kisi aise actor se nahin kar rahi jo industry main kaaphi zyada samay se ho
 But there was a time when i used to get only 5% fee as compared to the cost of costar
 jabaki us actor kaa kariyar graph mere kariyar ke saamaanya hua karata tha
 Now the industry is changing, although the land of the land immediately said that - today things are changing quickly
 mahilaon par kendrit itani sari filmein ban rahi hai jisamen unka role prabhaavshaalee rahata he
 Explain that till a decade ago in the industry, it was an exercise that the actress was paid less fees than the actor
 magar priyanka chopra, deepika padukon, kangana ranut, anoushka sharma or karina kapur jaisi actress kii pahal kaa nateeja he ki actress ko aaj industry main acchhee fees mil rahi he
 Deepika Padukone also openly admits that in some films, her fees are more than the lead actors of the film
 centre sarkaar ek baar phir teen talaak (triple Talaq) par roak lagane ke liye vidheyak laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The BJP says that the issue is part of its election manifesto, so a ban on triple talaq will be brought
 is mudde par sarkaar vidhi ayog kii report par bhi gaur karegi
 Union Law Minister Ravishankar Prasad said on Monday that the government would bring a bill again in Parliament to ban the practice of triple talaq
 pichley maheene 16 veen loksabhaa ke bhang hone ke saath fori teen talaak par pabandi lagane vaale vivaadit vidheyak kii miyaad samaapt ho gai kyonki yah sansad main paarit nahin hua or rajyasabha main lambit rah gaya
 The bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha and the pending bill does not end with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
 haalanki, loksabhaa se paarit or rajyasabha main lambit vidheyak kii miyaad samaapt ho jaati he
 The opposition was opposing the provisions of the bill in the Rajya Sabha, where the government did not have sufficient numbers to pass it
 yah puche jane par ki kya fori teen talaak (teen Talaq) par vidheyak ko phir se laayaa jayega, prasad ne kaha, ‘‘bilkul
 Fauri triple talaq (issue of) is part of our (BJP) manifesto
 kyon nahin?'' samaan naagarik samhita ko lekar ek sawaal par unhone kaha ki sarkaar is mudde par raajnneetik vichaar-vimarsh karegi
 She will also look into the Law Commission report on the issue
 pichley saal 31 may ko vidhi ayog ne mudde par sampurna report jari karne kii bajaae jari paraamarsh patr main kaha tha ki is samay samaan naagarik samhita kii ‘na to jarurat he or na hi vaanchit' he
 The commission had suggested changes in laws relating to marriage, divorce, alimony and marriageable age of women and men
 muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak main fori teen talaak (talaak e biddat) (triple Talaq) kii pratha ko dandaneey aparaadh banaaya gaya tha
 The bill was opposed by opposition parties
 (input bhashaa se) If there is a vote against the Colombo at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, India can support a us-backed resolution contrary to Sri Lanka's hope
 bharat kaa yah faisla tamil ladaakon ke khilaaf sangharsh main srilankai sena dwaara tamil nagarikon kii hatya ko lekar tamilnadu main upje gusse se prerit nahin hoga
 New Delhi agrees that the rehabilitation of the displaced in the north eastern part of the island has been done to some extent, but Sri Lanka does not appear to be serious in terms of national cohesion
 geneva main hone ja rahi baithak har haal main pichley varsh se bhinn he
 Last year too, the US had moved a resolution against Sri Lanka on human rights and other matters
 colombo ke lakh prayaason ke baad bhi america prastaav paarit ho gaya tha
 Membership of the 47-member UNHRC is received by rotation in countries
 rus, cuba or china pichley varsh colombo ke samarthak the, jo is samay parishad main nahin hai
 After Sri Lanka refused to negotiate with Washington last year, India negotiated with US diplomats and softened the proposal
 bharat ne prastaav se hastkshep karne vaale sandarbhon ko hatwa diya
 Like other developing countries, India is also sensitive to the western steps which are considered to interfere in the sovereign affairs of the country
 is baar pakistan or kuch waisi hi soch rakhane vaale desh srilanka kii taraf se america rajanyikon se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 The Congress-led central government has not disclosed its stand to be adopted during the voting this year, despite strong demands from various political factions in Tamil Nadu
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki america prastaav sanshodhit hona he or bharat uske antim rup par najar gadaaye hue he
 Another possibility is that the proposal should be accepted by consensus
 aisi sthiti main is mode par apane pattey jaahir karnaa bharat ke liye kahin se bhi laabhprad nahin rahegaa
 Colombo is feeling that this time in Geneva, compared to 2012, the bet is much bigger
 nai dilli kii soch par jin baton kaa gaharaa asar he unamem libration tigers of tamil ilam (littey) ko samul nasht kiye jane ke baad srilankai netritv dwaara buree tarah se kiya ja rahaa gadabadjhaalaa he
 India realizes that President Mahinda Rajapaksa is well aware that many Tamil civilians were killed in the last phase of the conflict
 aisi mauton ke liye saarvajanik pashchaatap or paryaapt muaavje kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 This move may slow down the burning flame in the minds of Tamils, as many people were dragged against their will during the conflict between Colombo and LTTE
 tippaniyan Instead, Sri Lanka is taking a strange stand
 vah baar-baar doharaa rahaa he ki littey ke khilaaf sainya karrwai ke dauraan koi bhi naagarik nahin maaraa gaya or nagarikon kii maut kii jimmedaari vah littey par thope rahaa he
 Colombo is also dragging its feet on the issue of national reconciliation and has refused to negotiate with the Tamil National Alliance, the largest Tamil group in Parliament
 srilanka ke is kadam se rashtriya sahmati khatai main pad gai he, jabaki aise upaay se das hajaar se zyada jindagi lilane vaale chauthai sadi tak chale sangharsh ke ghaavon ko bharne main madad mil sakati he
 This decision of India will not be motivated by the anger generated in Tamil Nadu over the killing of Tamil civilians by the Sri Lankan army in the struggle against Tamil fighters
 nai dilli is baat se sahamat he ki dweep ke uttar purvi hisse main visthapiton ke punarvaas kaa kaam kuch had tak hua he, lekin srilanka rashtriya saamanjasy ke maamle main gambhir nahin dikh rahaa he
 The meeting going to be held in Geneva is different from the previous year
 pichley varsh bhi america ne maanavadhikaar or anya maamalon ko lekar srilanka ke khilaaf prastaav pesh kiya tha
 The American resolution was passed even after Colombo's million attempts
 47 sadasyeey yuanechaarsi kii sadsyta baari-baari se deshon ko milti he
 Russia, Cuba and China were supporters of Colombo last year, who are not on the council at this time
 pichley varsh srilanka dwaara washington ke saath baatcheet karne se inkaar karne ke baad bharat ne america rajanyikon se baatcheet kar prastaav ko thodaa naram karavaaya
 India removed the interfering references from the proposal
 anya vikasshil deshon kii hi tarah bharat bhi pashchim ke un kadamon ke prati samvedansheel rahata he, jinhen desh ke samprabhu maamalon main hastkshep ke jaisaa mana jaataa he
 This time Pakistan and some like-minded countries are talking to American diplomats on behalf of Sri Lanka
 tamilnadu ke vibhinn raajnneetik dhadon kii taraf se joardaar maang ke baavjood congress nit centre sarkaar ne is varsh matdaan ke dauraan apanaae jane vaale apane rukh kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 One reason for this is that the US proposal has to be revised and India is eyeing its final form
 duusari ek sambhaavna yah bhi he ki prastaav mataiky se sweekaar kiya jaae
 In such a situation, it will not be beneficial for India to reveal its cards at this point
 colombo ko lag rahaa he ki 2012 ke mukaable geneva main is baar baaji joardaar bichhi hui he
 Among the things that have a profound impact on the thinking of New Delhi are the disturbing mess being made by the Sri Lankan leadership after the complete destruction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
 bharat mahasoos karata he ki raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe yah bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki sangharsh ke antim charan main kai tamil naagarik maare gaye the
 Public repentance and adequate compensation for such deaths may be declared
 is kadam se tamilon ke man main sulag rahi ang mand pad sakati he, kyonki colombo or littey ke bich chale sangharsh ke dauraan kai logon ko unki ichha ke viruddh ghasita gaya
 The comments iske bajaay srilanka ek vicitra rukh akhriyaar kiye baitha he
 He is repeatedly reiterating that no civilian was killed during the military action against the LTTE and that he is imposing responsibility for the civilian's death
 rashtriya sulah ke mudde par bhi colombo apane paanv peeche khinch rahaa he or sansad main sabase bade tamil samooh, tamil neshnal alliance ke saath baatcheet se inkaar kar chukaa he
 Sri Lankan move has hurt national consensus, while such a measure can help heal the wounds of a quarter-century struggle that took more than ten thousand lives
 geneva main hone ja rahi baithak har haal main pichley varsh se bhinn he
 Last year too, the US had moved a resolution against Sri Lanka on human rights and other matters

 Private ambulances running in the capital as PTA Transport Ambulances (PTA) are running on the rules
 na oxigen silendar, na first aid box
 Just a car with a light on it and an ambulance written on the front
 niyam kaayadon ke mutabik, ek gaadi ambulance tab banati he, jab usamen ek strechar, first aid box or oxigen silendar ho
 These ambulances parked outside a government hospital in the capital may not be ignoring the rules
 hamane hakeekat kaa jayja paanch aspataalon ke baahar jaakar liya
 These include AIIMS, Safdarjung, LNJP, RML and GTB Hospital
 kuch ambulance ke driveron ne to galati maan lee, to kuch hamen hi niyam main uljhane lag gaye
 Most of the replies were that small trains do not have a first aid box
 
 This rule is for large trains, while the absence of a box is a violation of the rule
 kai ambulance main to oxigen silendar na dikhne par jawaab mila, marij ko jarurat hogi to dukaan main he
 We will bring har jagah gadabadjhaalaa
 There are three types of ambulances
 eles yani advanced life saport, bles yani basic life saport or teesraa prakaar he pitie yani pesheynt transport ambulance
 And the same PTA is blatantly flouting the rules
 kuch kaa jawaab to or bhi dilachasp tha
 
 
 "no oxygen cylinders are needed for the die and neither the first aid box
 ham sirf shav dhone kaa kaam karte hai, lekin niyam kahata he ki ambulance marijon ke liye hoti he or shav dhone ke liye "HEARSE VAN" She was an innocent girl studying in class ninth
 patna ke uske hi skool kii gyarahavin class ke 'kute' senior prashanth jha ko dekhte hi uske dil kii dhadakanen tej ho jaaya karti thim
 Whenever she asked him to go out, she would happily bunk class and go out on Long Drive with him
 2010 main donon kii ankhen chaar hui thim or do saal main unka rishta paravaan chadhataa gaya
 Priya was sure that she and Prashant (both changed names) were made for each other
 ankhon main shaadi ke khwab sanjoe priya ne prashanth ke afares ke bare main udne vaali afvaahon par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 But Prashant's intentions were different
 june, 2012 main jab uske maa-baap ne hair studies ke liye use dilli bhejne kaa faisla liya to usne priya se pind chhudaane ke bare main sochna shuru kiya
 But he could not do so until he accepted a disgusting talk from his friends
 uske doston ne usase garlfriend 'shering' kii baat kahi
 Then on 14 June, Prashant called Priya to her friend Sushant at the Rambha apartment in Rajvansagar in Patna
 vahaan 17 varshiya priya apni aabru bachaane ke liye gidgidaati rahi
 Prashant, who vows to live with him, kept smiling away while his friends Rahul Lamba and Rahul alias Rannvijay stripped all the clothes from Priya's body
 unhone baari-baari se uski asmat ko taar-taar kiya or puure cond ko cellphone main kaid kiya gaya
 Priya said that she knew the other rapists (both are seniors in her school) and had earlier made several gestures to have sex with her
 lekin usne use isliye nazarandaaj kar diya kyonki ve prashanth ke jigari dost the
 The boys shot a 43-minute video and it was uploaded from a cyber café in late June
 sabase pehle prashanth ke ek junior 15 varshiya armaan ko yah link mila
 He immediately asked Priya to have sex with him to hide this thing
 ek hafte baad lamba ne priya ko ek sibar cafe main bulaayaa
 He showed her this video clip and promised that if he walks into the apartment once again, he will destroy the video
 usne priya se kaha ki yadi vah nahin maani to 'sushant bhaiya' uske maa-baap or police ko sab bataa denge
 She went to the flat where Lamba and 26-year-old Sushant then raped her
 isse unki himmat bad gai or unhone kuch dinon baad use phir se bulaayaa
 Finally, this time Priya dares to deny him
 do maheene baad ek din priya aadhi raat ko dar ke maare neend se jaag gai
 Her fearsome dream was related to the creepy truth: when people in her family came to know, she felt that Priya had ingrained her honor
 sadame kii shikaar priya ne khud ko bahari duniya se kaat liya
 He deleted his Facebook account
 cellphone switch of kar diya
 The family members of her friends prohibited meeting such a 'tainted' girl
 ladkadaati aawaaj main priya kahati he, ''main is sadame se baahar nahin nikal sakati
 i had great faith in him
 '' ghatana ne tab nayaa rup akhriyaar kar liya jab bihar mahila ayog (beadblusi) priya tak pahunchaa or usne dijipi ke saamne uskaa bayaan darj karaayaa
 After this, on July 24, an FIR was registered in this case
 ayog kii adhyaksh kehkashan parveen kahati hai, ''uskaa parivaar maamla darj nahin karana chahta tha
 He is still in a very critical condition
 ham chaahate hai ki sarkaar or samaaj uskaa saath de
 The Patna police have arrested Armaan, Prashant, Ranvijay, Lamba, Sushant and his 27-year-old domestic servant Dinesh
 prashanth or armaan ko bal sudhaar grih or baaki logon ko beur jail main daal diya gaya he
 The rape video is so terrible that it might even shock a country that has a disgusting record of 69 rapes every day
 neshnal krime record beuro kaa kahana he ki 2011 main rape kii 25,125 ghatnaayen huin
 Priya is a victim of a new trend of rape by teenagers
 2011 main 1,231 kishoron ko 1,149 rape karne ke liye giraftaar kiya gaya
 This clearly indicates that the teenagers are also joining the gang rape
 desh main kishoron ke haathon hone vaale aparaadhon kii sankhya main bhi ijapha ho rahaa he
 In 2001, 399 rapes were committed by juveniles while a decade later in 2011, the number reached 1,149
 patna ke jane-maane samajashastri dow
 Hetukar Jha says, "it's not good to delay now
 ham kishoron ke saath sex par charchaa ke liye is baat kaa intjaar nahin kar sakate ki ve khud hamase sex ke bare main sawaal karen
 Growing passion in them is definitely a problem of upbringing
 ''ek soshal network par lamba ne apane pasandida khel main likhaa he, ''bed games'' or usne drink karne, partiyon main jane or ladakiyon ke saath ko apni pasand bataaya he
 Prashanth's mother confesses to her son's criminal instincts
 asal main ve apane bete ko is ummid main nai jagah bhejnaa chaahati thim ki vahaan jane par vah sudhar jayega
 Says a policeman, "those who commit sex crimes are adept at misleading and deceiving them
" '' sabhi repist ne priya se shaadi karne kii peshkash kii he, is ummid main ki ve isse jail se reeha ho jaaenge
 Prashant's school certificate records his date of birth as 26 March 1994, due to which he managed to get the approval of the police by dodging the police and staying in the child improvement home instead of the jail
 bihar mahila ayog kii sadsy chandramukhi devi kahati hai, ''ek samaaj ke rup main ham bacchon ke aparaadhon ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai
 But we should understand that most of such criminals go ahead in big crime
 akasar unki krurta bhi bad jaati he or ve niyamit rup se aparaadh karne lagate hai

 The Talwar couple, who has been in jail for nearly four years in the murder of their daughter Aarushi and servant Hemraj, will be released from jail today
 sibiai court ke faisle ko khaarij karte hue elahabaad hoicourt ne talwaar danpati ko guuruuvaar ko hi bari kar diya tha
 But since 3 days his release has been embodied in the rules
 ab talwaar danpati ke daaman par lage daag to dhul gaye, lekin jaraa sochie, itane dinon tak unhone jo kuch saha kya uski bharpai kabhi ho paaegi?saalon se sirf dukh or dard jhel rahi suuni ankhon main aakhirkaar khushiyaan lautne vaali hai
 Aarushi's parents Nupur and Rajesh Talwar are scheduled to be released from Dasna jail in Ghaziabad today after the Allahabad High Court overturned a special CBI court verdict in the 9-year-old Aarushi Hemraj murder case
 talwaar danpati ko kareeb chaar saal baad jail kii kaal kothri se mukti milane vaali he
 But there has been a question again and again, how will he come back
 talwaar danpati kii begunaahi kii tamaam daleelon ko nakaarte hue sibiai court ne 26 november 2013 ko paristhitijanya sakshya ke aadhaar par aarushi ke mata-pita ko doshi qaraar diya tha
 Just think how deep that pain will be
 wo pidaa kitni baari hogi jab apni hi maasoom pyaari beti ke katl ke jurm main ek maa-baap ko jail main daal diya jaae
 About the feeling of a mother who lost her innocent daughter
 insaaf kii guhaar lagaate-lagaate usee ke katl ke jurm main kaal kothri main daal di gai
 Hope gives the person the courage to live
 jab ummiden tut jaaen to insaan jite-jite mar jaataa he
 With the light of hope, Nupur and Rajesh Talwar kept cutting day and night in Ghaziabad's Dasna jail, their penance finally confessed
 agle hafte diwali he
 Aarushi is not there, but after a long time, the Talwar couple will be able to light the lamp of Aarushi's memories in her house
 har tyohaar, ek-ek cheez unke jehan main movie kii tarah chalati rahati hai
 Aarushiis is not in the world, but the memories of her family are still alive today
 aarushi kii maut ke baad puure 9 saal apane daaman par lage daag ko saaf karne main hi biit gaya
 a bundle of beautiful memories of Aarushi was buried in her heart
 aarushi ke katl ke iljaamon kaa daag dhul chukaa he
 The Talwar couple will be freed from prison imprisonment
 lekin jail se baahar aane ke baad man main kasak bani rahegi ki is aazaadee kaa jashn manaaen yaa beti ke asli kaatil tak kanoon kii pahunch naa hone kaa ronaa roen? What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 The US Federal Reserve has once again raised interest rates, ignoring President Donald Trump's advice
 fedral rigerv ke pramukh jirom powell ne trump ke dabaav ko nazarandaaj karte hue ek saal main chauthi baar ijapha kar diya he
 The rise in interest rates in the US led to a decline in the US stock market and government bonds
 iske saath hi is faisle ke asar se duniyabar ke share bazaaron main giravat ai or dollar ke mukaable vaishvik mudraon main giravat darj hui
 In addition to this increase in interest rates for the US government and global economies, the Federal Reserve claims that it can announce further rate cuts

 Jirom Powal has said with the increase that he will cut $ 50 billion per month in his balance sheet

 film kaa naam:bajrangi bhaijandiarector:kabir khanster cast:salmaan khan, navazuddin siddiki, karina kapur, harshali malhotra, om puriretting:4 / 5bataurasalmanka superphan 'kik' kii relies ke puure 355 din baad bade parde par salmaan ke didaar hue hai
 There is no doubt that in 2009, 'wanted' and then in '2010' Dabangg developed the Salman genre of cinema
 ausat kahani ke baavjood salmaan johnor kii filmein superhit sabit huin
 But 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' is not the film of this newly developed genre from anywhere
 'bajrangi bhaijan'kii shuruyaat kashmir kii barfili vaadiyon se hoti he, vahiin 2 ghante 43 minute baad vah barf ankhon kii kor main pighalati mahasoos hoti he
 This is the first time in the last six years, when Salman's films have made the audience entertained, especially his fans
 yun to bhavukta kaa paath 'kik' main bhi padhaayaa gaya tha, lekin tab 'devil kaa hangover' zyada tha
 The teaser of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' released on 28 May and the trailer released on 18 June
 film ko lekar utsukata badi, haalanki kahani kaa akalan tabhi ho gaya
 In such a situation, Salman was the only recipe for hundreds of fans like me to keep myself curious about the film
 17 july ko theatre main jab parde par salmaan kii entry hui to khub taaliyaan baji, lekin ant aate-aate taaliyon se zyada roomaal jarurat ban gai
 In such a situation, it is quite possible that a large section of fans have been disappointed this time
 
 
 
 But the mood has changed since 2009, breaking all the prejudices that Salman Khan and his films have created
 film kii kahani sweet or simple he, jisamen mardhaad or karishmai stants kii koi gunjaaish nahin thi
 It is good that neither Kabir Khan nor Salman took any such risk
 aise main lambey arase baad apane hero ko ek sanjeeda kirdaar main dekhakar acha lagata he
 More than that, there is happiness when the critics who have been anti-salman till now, in subdued words, appreciate Salman's success and right in the same words
 diarector sahab agali baar yahaan dhyaan dena'bajrangi bhaijan'kii safalataa ko dekhte hue salmaan khan ne haal hi ghoshnaa kii he ki wo kabir khan ke saath teesri film karne vaale hai
 Kabir Khan is a good director
 salmaan khan ke saath unki ye duusari film thi, lekin jo kami 'ek tha tiger' main khali vahi is film ke saath bhi he
 Kabir sir, when you have so much to say, why do you spend so much time creating the initial atmosphere on screen
 'ek tha tiger' kii tarah 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii shuruyaat bhi dhimi he
 The film starts to get a bit boring by the time it gets into its blood
 lekin ant aate-aate sabakuch badhiya ho jaataa he
 Signs of a comeback of 'prem' This time the film has also seen Salman's pathetic side and he seems to be trying to break out of his 'dabangg' image

 yani sabakuch thik rahaa to parde par ek baar phir 'prem' kii vaapasi hone vaali he
 Nawazuddin's entry gives momentum to the film
 salmaan ek actor se kahin zyada antertainer hai
 He knows that Nawazuddin's acting on the screen can make him disappear from the frame, but despite this, the way he has chosen Nawazuddin for the second time in a row, it is his greatness
 kyonki jaahir taur par koi bhi bada actor apane saamne khud se behatar kalakaar ko panpane nahin dena chahta
 Nawazuddin will accompany Salman in the next Eid release 'sultan'
 shahida / munni ke kirdaar main harshali film kii jaan he
 He really is the trump card of the film

 Kareena's share is nothing but she looks beautiful
 film main har pahar ke liye ek geet he
 From Salman's entry to the dargah to the prayers and prayers of the Rastas, there is a song going on all the time
 aise main bich main kahin 'aaj kii party' vaala trek bhi lagaaya hi ja saktaa tha
 
 
 
 kyonki sabakuch cinema nahin hotafilm main kuch seen aise bhi hai jo gale nahin utarate
 For example, in the last scene, people break the locks hanging on the border and stand morally within their limits
 pakistani sena kaa vyaavhaarik andaaj se itar awam or sarkaar ke saamne sarender karnaa yaa phir shuruaati seen main shahida kaa train se utarana, lekin ain maukey par train kii suraksha main paharaa de rahe ghudsavaar dal kaa gaayab ho janaa
 Well, it goes on because if everything is real then how will it be called cinema and then entertainment is also a matter
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki jindagi cinema nahin
 This film has also been released in Pakistan
 sarhad se lekar siyasat tak pakistan kii sena or sarkaar se koi ummid paalna ab bemaani sa ho gaya he, aise main ummid yah he ki kam se kam sarhad paar hamaare bhaaiyon ko bhi 'bajrangi bhaijan' bhaavnaatmak door main baandhegi or wo bhi shahida, pawan kumaar chaturvedi or chand mohammad ke bahaane pal rahe siyaasi tanabana se ittfa rakhenge kyonki donon mulkon ke rishton main kabhi to subah aegi

 Before the famous Padmanabhaswamy temple in Kerala, gold worth Rs 186 crore was reported stolen and now eight precious diamonds have gone missing
 emicas gopal subramanyam ne somvaar ko supreme court main bataaya ki bhagwaan padmanabhaswami kii murti ke mastak par lage aath pracheen heere gaayab hai

 supreme court mangalvaar ko emicas gopal kii maang par sunwaayee karegaa
 The comments sunwaayee ke dauraan subramanyam ne supreme court ko bataaya ki kerala kii krime branch police isaki jaanch kar rahi he
 The price of diamond is estimated to be Rs 21 lakh
 haalanki isaki asli keemat rupee main nahin aanki ja sakati kyonki pracheenta ke kaaran inako dharohar mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the register of the temple should also be checked so that it can be ascertained that the value of the missing diamond can be fixed
 gopal ne court ko yah bhi bataaya ki mandir ke register se yah pataa chalata he ki gaayab heere kareeb 70-80 saal puraane hai
 The news is shocking as former accountant Vinod Roy in his report 10 months ago said that gold worth Rs 186 crore is missing from the temple
 adaalat ke aadesh par pehle bhi audit kiya tha or paaya gaya tha ki sone ke 769 bartan gaayab hai

 aise main mandir kaa register bhi jaancha janaa chahie jisase yah pataa chal sake ki gaayab heere kii keemat kya tay kii ja sakati he
 Gopal also told the court that the temple register shows that the missing diamonds are around 70-80 years old
 yah khabar chaunkaane vaali he kyonki 10 maheene pehle purv lekhaakaar vinod roy ne apni report main kaha tha ki mandir se 186 karod rupee kaa sona gaayab he
 The court had earlier audited the order and it was found that 769 gold vessels were missing
 pichley kuch saalon se yah mandir prabandhan kii gadabadi kii lekar surkhiyon main rahaa he
 During the hearing, Subramanian told the Supreme Court that the Crime Branch Police of Kerala is investigating it

 aise main mandir kaa register bhi jaancha janaa chahie jisase yah pataa chal sake ki gaayab heere kii keemat kya tay kii ja sakati he
 Gopal also told the court that the temple register shows that the missing diamonds are around 70-80 years old
 yah khabar chaunkaane vaali he kyonki 10 maheene pehle purv lekhaakaar vinod roy ne apni report main kaha tha ki mandir se 186 karod rupee kaa sona gaayab he
 The court had earlier audited the order and it was found that 769 gold vessels were missing
 pichley kuch saalon se yah mandir prabandhan kii gadabadi kii lekar surkhiyon main rahaa he
 The news is shocking as former accountant Vinod Roy in his report 10 months ago said that gold worth Rs 186 crore is missing from the temple
 adaalat ke aadesh par pehle bhi audit kiya tha or paaya gaya tha ki sone ke 769 bartan gaayab hai
 For the last few years, it has been in the limelight due to the mess of the temple management

 The Supreme Court on Friday raised a number of questions with the temple board and the government in the case of ban on entry of women between 10 and 50 years of age to the Sabarimala temple in Kerala
 supreme court ne poocha ki jab mahilaon or purushon ke bich bhedbhaav vedon, upanishdon yaa kisi bhi shaastra main nahin kiya gaya he, to sabarimala main aisa kyon he?yang loyrs association kii yachika par sunwaayeeis niyam ke khilaaf yang loyrs association naam kii ek sanstha ne yachika daakhil kii he
 The court will now hear the matter whether the ban on the entry of women can be fixed or not? The court gave an example of mythological texts: The court said that according to the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna is everywhere and dwells in everyone
 bhagwaan ne mahila or purushon main kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav nahin kiya he
 It is also mentioned in the Bhagavad-gītā Granth
 aise main bhagwaan ke mandir main kisi mahila ke pravesh par kaise pabandi lagaai ja sakati he
 The court asked whether there is any rule in Hinduism that says that women are not allowed to enter the temple
 yah tippanee supreme court ke nyaayadhish deepak mishra kii bench ne shuukravaar ko kerala ke sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par pabandi ko lekar daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue kii he
 The state government should follow the law
 The Supreme Court asked the Kerala government to talk about the rules and the law on this matter and do not make any argument
 agar hindu dharm main is baat kaa ullekh he ki kisi ko bhagwaan ke ghar arthath mandir main pravesh se roka ja saktaa he to wo us kanoon va granth kii jaankaree adaalat ko de
 Logic will be heard here, not a sentimental appeal
 court se 6 hafte kaa samay maangakerala sarkaar ne is maamle main apana jawaab daayar karne ke liye supreme court se 6 hafte kaa samay maanga
 Which has been accepted by the Supreme Court
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 11 april ko hogi
 At the same time, it was argued before the court by the temple management and Kerala government that this practice has been going on in the Sabarimala temple for many decades
 logon kii dharmik aasthaa isse judi he
 The system of the temple is not a law, on which the Supreme Court said that this temple can be called the arrangement, but not the law
 kanoon ke anusaar mahila or purush samaan hai or donon ko mandir main pravesh kii anumati he
 The Supreme Court has appointed senior advocate Raju Ramachandran as amicus curiae for lobbying on behalf of the petitioner in this case
 vahiin, supreme court ne maamle main varisht vakil ram jethmalani ko kaha ki kya wo is maamle main yachikakarta kii ore se adaalat main pairvi kar sakate hai
 On the last hearing that has been going on for many decades, the Kerala government had filed its reply in the Supreme Court, saying that women have not been allowed to enter the Sabarimala temple for many decades
 yah vyavastha logon kii dharmik aasthaa ke anusaar pehle se hi tay he
 Therefore women cannot be allowed entry into the Sabarimala temple
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ki kai sadiyon puraani parampara kaa bachaav karnaa hamaara kartavya hai
 Rights of women in the constitution The state government had also said in its affidavit that this is not just a matter of old tradition
 hamaara samvidhan bhi mandiron ko ye adhikaar detaa he ki wo mandir main kise pravesh detaa he kise nahin
 At the same time, the Constitution also gives us the right to religious freedom
 kerala sarkaar ne apni purv kii baat se you turn lete hue 2007 main tatkalin kerala sarkaar ke halafname ko waapas le liya tha or nayaa halafanama daayar kiya tha

 Yet women of menstrual age are prohibited from entering the temple
 is aayu varg se purv kii ladakiyon or uske baad kii praudh mahilaon or vriddhaon ke pravesh par sabarimala mandir main koi roak nahin he

 Aam Aadmi Party's Haryana convenor Naveen Jaihind said in a tweet that 'in Haryana, you will contest all 10 Lok Sabha and 90 Vidhan Sabha on your own
 JJP ke saath gathbandhan kii baatcheet samaapt
 Earlier, there was talk of an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 lekin siton ke bantwaare ko lekar baat na ban paane kii vajah se donon hi partiyon ne chunaav main akele hi jane kaa faisla kiya he
 Naveen Jaihind said that JJP is giving us only 2 seats out of 10 and in return is asking for one seat in Delhi
 unka yah prastaav hamaari party ko manjuur nahin he
 We believe that if this alliance happens, only BJP will benefit from it
 unhone kaha ki hamanen JJP ko kaafii samajhaayaa par vah nahin maan rahi

 The Aam Aadmi Party supported JJP candidate Digvijay Chautala in the recent Jind assembly by-election
 aam aadmi party ke rajyasabha saansad susheel gupta ne sakriy rup se JJP ke ummidavaar ke liye chunaav prachaar bhi kiya tha
 The head of the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself went to Jind to campaign for the JJP candidate
 bataa den ki haryana dilli se laga hua rajya he
 There is Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi
 isliye party dilli or punjab ke baad ab haryana main chunaav ke liye puraa jor laga rahi he
 The party's chief, Arvind Kejriwal, is constantly rallying in different areas of Haryana, and is clearly telling about the work done in Delhi government school and hospital

 Modi thanked Theresa May for visiting India first after becoming Prime Minister
 modi ne kaha, 'hamen shiksha or anusandhan avasaron main yuva logon kii bhagidaari ko protsaahit karnaa chahie' Have you ever heard of a country advertising and taking time out of the race to ask couples to go on vacation? Yes, it is happening in Denmark
 yahaan ek vigyaapan ke jariye girti janmadar ko badhaane ke liye couples ko chuttee manaane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 The video is named 'do It for Denmark'
 'du it for denmark' video main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise kaam-kaaj se dur hone par mahila or purush ekadusre ke kareeb aaenge
 Doctors claim here that couples do more sex when they are on leave
 video yah bhi bataata he ki danish bacchon main se 10 pratishat bachche aise hai, jo chhuttiyon ke dauraan hi plane kiye gaye hai
 Not only this, producer Spite Travel has also offered a free holiday to a pregnant woman by going on their 'ovulation discount' trip
 vigyaapan 'du it for denmark' abhiyaan main poocha jaataa he 'kya sex denmark ke bhavishya ko bachaa saktaa he?' iske saath ek kaaran yah bhi he ki 'denmark pareshaaniyon se jujh rahaa he
 'birthday here is at the lowest level of 27 years
 yahaan buudhe logon kii taadaad bahut zyada he, jabaki bachche paidaa hi nahin ho rahe hai
 If the Danish government could not find any solution to this difficulty, then an advertisement was prepared, which could increase the declining birth rate
 is vigyaapan main choti kahani bhi dikhaai gai he
 In the video, an interview of the physician Biggrit Dagmari Johansson is taken
 unka daawa he, 'chhuttiyon main ghoomane jane se, nae anubhavon se rishton main taazgi aati he
 Couples see each other in a new way
 isse mastishk main endorphin taiyaar hota he, jo ki sex kii ichha ko badhaata he
 In fact, 46 percent of Danish people spend more of their holidays than usual
 vigyaapan main aage aata he, 'to denmark ke ghatate janmadar ko rokane ke liye, spice travel prayek danish ko ek romantic chuttee par jane ke liye prerit karnaa chahta he
 "not only this, people have been told in the advertisement to book your vacation, and by returning from there, if you prove that your partner is pregnant, then you will get three years of baby diapers, other items and child friendly holiday trips
 vigyaapan ne logon ko isse jodne ke liye kaha he ki isamen jeetna jaruri nahin he, jaruri he ki aap is abhiyaan main hissaa len- 'du it for denmark
 See what is it for Denmark in the video

 This time, Sharad's name also cropped up as a prime ministerial candidate in the Chunavs

 On the matter of bjp's PM in Waiting LK Advani and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi calling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a weak Prime Minister, Pawar said that Narendra Modi has a habit of making irresponsible statements but Advani is also doing so which is surprising
 manmohan singh kii tarif karte hue unhon kaha ki wo ek bahut achche insaan or majboot pradhanmantri hai
 Sharad Pawar said that the Prime Minister should come to administration and the image should be clear and there should be experience as well and Manmohan's experience is good

 He told that only six months ago, NCP had proposed to the Congress that Manmohan should be declared UPA candidate and go to the public, but the Congress did not do so for any reason
 isliye ab chunaav ke baad yah tay hoga kii upie kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke liye ummidavaar koun hoga
 a decision on the PM candidate will be taken by consensus in the UPA meeting after the election
 sharad pavaar ne kaha ki desh tarakkee kar rahaa he or krishi utpaadan bad rahaa he
 However, regarding the plight of the farmers, he said that the problem of water and electricity is big in the country
 iske alaava bhi kisaanon ke saamne kai mushkilen hai
 Pawar said that during the UPA regime, farmers got good prices for their crops and subsidies were also given

 media dwaara rahul gandhi ko piem pad kaa ummidavaar bataae jane par pavaar ne kaha ki rahul abhi piem pad ke ummidavaar nahin hai
 He said that Rahul himself has said many times that he is not yet a candidate for the post of PM and when Rahul will be the candidate, NCP will consider supporting him
 pavaar kii raay main left kii madad ke bina sarkaar nahin ban sakati or tisare morche kii sarkaar bananaa mushkil he
 When asked if the Left has announced not to support the UPA, Pawar said that the Left can change after the election

 ITR daakhil karne ke liye 31 agast tak kaa hi samay heitiar daakhil nahin kiya to lag saktaa he 5 hajaar tak kaa jurmanagalat itiar form bharne se bachanaa chahieinakam tex ritern (ITR) daakhil karne ke liye 31 agast tak kaa hi samay he yani aaj ko lekar teen din hi bache hai
 For those who have not yet filed income tax returns, there is still a chance, do it immediately
 itiar daakhil karnaa ab online hone se kaaphi aasaan ho gaya he, iske baavjood agar aapako dikkat mahasoos ho rahi ho to kisi chartered accountint kii madad leni chahie
 If you come under the tax net and you have not filed ITR, then the Income Tax Department can impose a fine of up to Rs 5000
 iskar ritern kaa form aapako bahut saavdhaanee se bharna hoga
 For your convenience, we are talking about five common mistakes that people often make
 aisi galatiyon se bachakar aap sahi tareeke se ritern kaa form bhar sakate hai
 1
 galat itiar form bharnatex or nivesh export balavant jain bataate hai, 'sabase pehle aapako yah jaananaa chahie ki aapako koun-sa itiar form bharna he
 If the wrong form is filled then the entire exercise will be of no use
 zyaadaatar logon ko itiar-1 bharna hota he, jise sahaj kaha jaataa he
 If you are an individual taxpayer whose total annual income is less than Rs 50 lakh (from all sources), then you have to fill this form
 lekin agar 50 lakh rupee se zyada kii salanaa aay he, ek se zyada houseng property he, kisi company main diarectorship he, capital gains se inakam he, videsh se koi inakam he to aapako ITR-2 bharna hoga
 'individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) earning income from a business or profession have to file ITR-3
 2
 Not to mention income from other sources, other than salary or business income, you must also tell the income from other sources
 seaving bank kaa intrest saamaanya logon ke liye 10,000 rupee or senior citigen ke liye 50,000 tak texable aay se mukt he, lekin isaki jaankaree aapako inakam main dikhaakar didction clem karnaa hota he
 If TDS is deducted on FD, then you should also inform about it
 agar aap jaankaree chhipaayenge to penalty bhi lag sakati he
 This can range from 50 to 200 percent of tax evasion
 naaballig bacchon kii aay kii bhi jaankaree jarur deni chahie
 Minor is an active income like income from a TV show will be taxable for the child, but is a passive income, such as if there is income from an investment in his name, then it is tax free up to Rs 1500 annually, more than the mother or Will be added to the father's income (whoever has more income)
 log mutual fund yaa sheyaron se hone vaale capital gains bataanaa kai baar bhul jate hai, capital gains kaa vivaran bharte samay sailareed log zyada galati karte hai, kyonki unke liye isaki jaankaree kaaphi jatil lagati he
 So if you have income from capital gains then the help of a professional CA must be taken
 3
 Do not give information about more than one house, if there is more than one house, then you cannot use ITR-1 form
 aapako ITR-2 bharna hoga
 If there is a self occupation of more than one house, then according to the rule of the last year, only one house will be exempted, for the other house, the rental income will be given at the market rate on which 30% deduction is also given
 4
 Do not update contact details, it is very important that you update your email ID and phone number
 aajkal iskar vibhaag sampark i-mail yaa phone ke dwaara hi karata he
 Keep in mind that do not give the email ID or phone number received by the employer, but give your personal email or phone number, because your personal contact will work only if you leave the job
 5
 Not to give details of all bank accounts, details of all bank accounts should be given in the income tax return
 itiar ke form main detail bharen to usamen bank acount bahut saavdhaanee se bharen kyonki aajkal rifund sidhe acount main hi online aata he
 Therefore, in the ITR, you have to give details about which account you want the refund
 agar galati kii to dobaaraa process karne main kaaphi dikkat aegi
 Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf will return home to lead his party in the upcoming elections on March 24, ending his last four years of self-imposed exile in Dubai and London
 musharraf (69) ne apane ek bayaan main kaha ki ve aagaamee chunaavon main apni party kaa netritv karne ke iraade se swadesh lautenge
 Musharraf plans to reach Karachi on 24 March in a business flight and then attend a rally of about 50,000 people, which will also be attended by around 200 Pakistani expatriates living in the US, Canada, UK and the United Arab Emirates
 unki yojana may main hone ja rahe pakistan ke aam chunaav main apni party ol pakistan muslim lig kaa netritv karnaa he
 Significantly, in 1999, the then Pakistani army chief Musharraf became the country's president in a bloodless military coup
 varsh 2008 main raashtrapati pad se hatane vaale musharraf ne isse pehle un sawaalon ko nazarandaaj kar diya tha jisamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki kya swadesh aane par unke khilaaf chal rahe kai maamalon ke silsile main unhen giraftaar kiya jaayegaa yaa nahin
 These cases include the case of assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
 udhar pakistan pipuls party ke netaaon ne kaha he ki musharraf jaise hi pakistan aaenge, unhen giraftaar kar liya jayega, kyonki ve benazir kii hatya ke silsile main adhikariyon dwaara vaanchit hai

 The Narendra Modi government presented the first budget of its second innings in Parliament on Friday
 sarkaar ne pehali baar saamaajik udhyamita ko badhaava dene ke liye neshnal stock exange (enesai) or bisai kii tarj par soshal stock exange kii baat kii he
 Economists consider this to be a very positive step in terms of linking enterprises with social concerns
 arthshaastriyon ke mutabik, yun to is bajet main bahut si chijen gum hai, kai yojanaon kii puri ruparekha abhi saaf nahin kii gai he
 But still there is a vision in it, which indicates a change in the country's economy in the coming years
 sankat se jujh rahe aviation or baaki sectors main epadiai kaa rasta khole jane se unhen sankat se ubaarane main madad milegi
 The government has introduced more than 100 labor laws replacing only four types of laws as a revolutionary step
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki shram kanoonon main sudhaar kii pahal se pataa chalata he modi sarkaar ne us kamjor nas ko pakad liya he, jiske chalate china se kai samanthaayen hone ke baavjood uske mukaable bharat manuphaccharing hub nahin ban paaya
 According to economists, many previous governments could not muster the courage to reform the labor laws, but the Modi government has taken the initiative to change it
 yah shubh sanket he
 Growth Oriented Budget: Prof
 sharmadilli skool of iconomics ke purv dean or global research foundation for karporate gavarnence ke chairman pro
 Jai Prakash Sharma calls this budget of the Modi government as 'growth oriented'
 aajtak
 in conversation with Prof
 sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar ne bajet main vaaki kai ahm, jaruri or nae kadam uthaae hai
 For example, the government has given auspicious signs by arranging Rs 35 thousand crore to save the micro, medium and small scale industries (MSE) sector in crisis
 iskaa laabh jiesti main registerd udhyamon ko milegaa
 The initiative to start a new social stock exchange with the National and Regional Stock Exchange is good
 isse saamaajik kshetra main kaam karne vaale udhyam bhi stock exange main registerd ho sakenge
 The government has taken this better step to connect enterprises with the betterment of society
 dilli skool of iconomics ke purv dean pro
 JP Sharmapro
 sharma ke mutabik aviation, media or insurance sector main epadiai laane kaa faisla ghate se duubati tamaam companiyon ko bachaane main madadgaar sabit hoga
 If aviation had a system of FDI before then, some airlines would not have been on the verge of closure due to the recent losses
 pro
 According to Sharma, there was a demand to spend 6 percent of GDP on education
 magar isko lekar koi praavdhaan na hona thodaa niraashajanak he
 However, the government has made a commitment to academic quality by talking about creating a National Research Foundation
 pro
 Sharma says, if we talk about the biggest factors of this budget, then it is the steps taken by the Modi government towards labor reforms
 pichhali kai sarkarein isko lekar himmat nahin juta pain
 But the Modi government has talked of incorporating more than 100 labor laws into only four laws
 yah ek krantikari kadam ho saktaa he
 This will not only eliminate Inspector Raj, but will bring relief to factories and companies
 pro
 Sharma says on the importance of labor reforms that India can compete with China
 darasal china or bharat main kai samanthaayen hai
 Population is also more of both countries and labor is also cheaper
 growth rate bhi acha he
 But China became a manufacturing hub, but not India
 iskaa mukhya kaaran he ki china main sirf ek lebar lau he, jabaki bharat main 100 se adhik tarah ke lebar lau main companiyaan jakadi hui hai
 The initiative to give 70 thousand crore rupees to save PSU banks is also a good step
 houseing lone par saadhe teen lakh tak kii chhot se naukareepesha varg ko kuch laabh hoga
 However, in order to save the auto sector facing recession, the government did not provide some arrangements in this budget
 yah transformational bajet haih pro
 Professor Dhananjay Sahu of the Faculty of Commerce of sahubhu described the Modi government's budget as transformational
 unka maananaa he ki yah ek ashaavadi bajet he
 The government has indicated to bring changes in the country and economy through some new provisions
 mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kii disha main acchhee pahal kii gai he
 Reduction in corporate tax will increase the economy
 multinational companiyon ko ab tak 45 pratishat tak tex chukaana padataa tha, jisase kai bahurashtriya companiyaan bharat kii jagah china or duniya ke duusare deshon kaa rukh karti thim
 But by reducing corporate tax, the government has attracted multinational companies to come to India
 haalanki tex slab main kisi tarah kaa parivartan na hone se bajet main naukareepesha logon ke liye kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 Welcome to new steps, but where will the money come from: Prof
 dvivedipurvanchal vishvavidhyalay ke professor ajay dvivedi bajet main adarsh kiraaya kanoon or van nesan- van grid system kii vyavastha ko bada kadam maanate hai
 However, after the outline of how the government will do forest grid system for electricity, gas and water, something can be said
 agar van grid system lagu hoga to isaki aapurti ko lekar kshetreey vishamataayen khatm hongi
 Pro
 dvivedi ke mutabik, karmyogi yojana ke tahat sarkaar ne ek karod se neeche turnover vaale khudara vyapaariyon ko pension dene kii baat kahi he
 But the government did not say where the money will come from
 jahaan tak sarkaar agle paanch varshon main 5 trillian dollar arthvyavastha kii baat karti he to isamen andeh lagata he
 The reason is that the government did not present any blueprint in the budget
 sabase bada mudda desh main rojgaar kaa he
 The government talked about generating employment in the budget, but did not say where and how employment will be created
 purvanchal vishvavidhyalay ke professor dow
 Ajay Dwivedi government has said to reduce the tax on electric vehicles to save the environment
 yah acha kadam he
 But for this, good roads and charging points should be arranged

 He had three slips and a lane
 lekin smith of stump par shafal ho kar aae jisase unka of stump cover ho gaya or leg stump khul gaya
 He was dropping the ball and selecting the balls very cleverly
 jab bhi smith ke liye leg slip lagaai gai tab unhone leg stump nahin choda kyonki vah jaanate the ki gendbaaj is aria ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai or agar unhone shafal kiya to gend ko jameen par rakhana unke liye mushkil ho jayega
 But if you cover the leg stump with your left foot, you will always be above the ball

 In fact, after the end of the Lok Sabha elections this year, the Election Commission had asked the TMC and CPI why they could not withdraw their national party status after they failed to get a fixed percentage of votes and seats
 On the notice of the Election Commission, TMC and CPI filed a reply in the Election Commission and said that no review should be done till the 2024 Lok Sabha elections on the process of withdrawal of national party status

 Also, there should be at least two percent of the total Lok Sabha seats and its candidates should come from at least three states

 Two priests of the world-famous Pashupatinath temple of Lord Shiva were attacked by Maoists on Friday, tore their clothes and broke their thread

 The protests over the appointment took the violent form on Friday
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki lagbhag 40-50 maovadiyon ne shraddhaluon ke vesh main dedh baje ke aasapaas mandir main pravesh kiya
 They dragged priests named Girish Bhatt (32) and Raghavendra Bhatt (32) out
 maovadiyon ne unki dhoti phadi or janeu tod diye
 Priests have been badly injured in the attack

 The temple administration recently brought these priests here from Karnataka
 pujaariyon kaa chayan karne vaali teen sadasyeey samiti ke sadsy shivasharan raaj bhandari ne yah jaankaree di

 har guzarate din ke saath syria main iesas or syrian sarkaar ke bich jari grihayuddh main rus apni dilchaspee badha rahaa he or har guzarate din ke saath hi ye dilchaspee syrian jameen par maut or barbaadi kaa aankada bhi badha rahi he

 " Rahul Gandhi has finally been elected the new president of the Congress
 desh kii is sabase puraani party main aupchaarik rup se rahul yug shuru ho chukaa he
 However, it is also true that the time of Rahul's coronation is also the worst time of the Congress
 loksabhaa chunaav main 50 siton ke neeche to congress 2014 main hi aa gai thi lekin uske baad ek ke baad ek rajyon se uski satta bhi chali gai jisane kamjor hui party ko or khastahal kar diya
 Apparently, the new president of Congress has a crown of thorns on his head
 unke saamne khadi chunautiyaan vastav main unki asli pariksha lengi
 Strengthening Congress As Congress President, the biggest challenge before Rahul Gandhi is to strengthen the party
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad congress ke haath se lagaataar ek ke baad ek rajyon kii satta nikalati gai
 Rahul Gandhi is going to take charge of the Congress at a time when the party has been reduced to just six states
 aise main sanghathan ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii jimmedaari rahul ke kandhon par hogi
 The biggest party in front of Rahul Gandhi is to rejuvenate
 jameen par congress ko utaarnacongress party ko jameen par utaarna rahul gandhi ke liye sabase badi chunauti he
 Congress has its leaders, but the workers are not visible
 congress ke saamne sabase badi dikkat booth label par party ko khadaa karne kii he
 The absence of the party at the booth level is the biggest reason for the Congress's defeat in the current era
 jabaki bijepi kii jade booth str tak majboot hai
 To strengthen the Congress, it has to be prepared at the booth level, in line with the BJP
 nayaa drushtikon taiyaar karnasoshal media par rahul gandhi bhale hi der se active hue hai, lekin ab unhone majbootee se apni upasthiti darj karai he
 Rahul Gandhi has started using such native words in his speeches, which increase his reach to the common people and street to street
 apane nae avatar se unhone khaasaa prabhavit kiya he, lekin party ko nai disha or drushtikon dena sabase badi chunauti he
 Going out of the legacy Harahul Gandhi's identity so far is as the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 rahul apane parnana kii vichaardhaara ke boj tale dabe hue lagate hai
 Whereas they have to come out of it to meet the expectations of the voters of the current round
 piem narendra modi ko garibon ke saath sidhe samvaad ke liye janaa jaataa he, aise main rahul gandhi ko bhi aise hi raste talashne honge
 The Modi wave faces Samanarahul Gandhi, the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has become the mantra of bjp's victory
 modi lahar ke sahare bijepi ne ek ke baad ek rajya main jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he
 The BJP has seized power by decimating the strong fort of Congress like Assam
 rahul ke saamne sabase badi chunauti modi lahar kaa mukaable apni hawa ko bananaa he
 The role of strong opposition The reasons for which the Congress went to power at the hands of the Congress and the manner in which the Modi government is concerned about the Congress during the bjp's power are two reasons
 pehali, congress vipaksh kii bhoomika main kamjor rahi or bijepi vipaksh main bhoomika main hameshaa majboot rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress will have to return to the role of opposition and the biggest challenge for Rahul will be to fight against the Modi government from road to parliament
 senior-junior netaaon ke bich santulanrahul gandhi ke saamne ek chunauti party ke senior or junior netaaon ke bich behatar talmail baitaane kii he
 Political tussle between senior and youth leaders of the party continues in many states
 rajasthan main ashok gahalot banaam sachin payalat, empi main digvijay singh banaam jyotiraditya sindhiya, dilli main shila dikshit banaam ajay maakan ke bich rishte jagajaahir hai
 Stepping out of the 'non-serious' image of himself, BJP has been projecting Narahul Gandhi as a non-serious leader
 bijepi adhyaksh se lekar piem modi tak rahul ko aparipakv netaa bataate rahe hai
 In such a situation, the challenge will be to confront the opponents with breaking this image in front of Rahul
 vidhansabha chunaav jeetna rahul kii chunauticongress adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhi ke kandhon par jimmedaari kaa boj or bhi bad gaya he
 Gujarat and Himachal assembly elections are the first test
