 Probably should have included these factors and might not
 yah puri kavayad kyon kii gai?yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki puure desh ke nagarikon ko samaan gunvattta kii saarvajanik vasteen or sevaayen hasil ho saken
 In such a case, if there is a state with a large proportion of its population living in villages with a population of less than 500 and also having hilly and inaccessible areas, then the supply cost of goods and services is much higher
 to kya ise bhi ek maandand nahin hona chahie tha?iske vipareet, kya essi / asti kaa vargeekaran kisi pichhadepan kaa sanketak ho saktaa he? anusuchit jati kii jansankhya ke bare main kai research hui hai jinase pataa chalata he ki agar anya karkon par aapkaa niyantran ho to essi hona koi janm se phaaydon se dur rakhane vaala nahin he
 Should female literacy rate or female work participation rate be the norm? Per capita monthly consumption expenditure was considered an alternative indicator of income
 kya ise apnaanaa chahie tha yaa iske kisi vishisht kaarak ko, jaise gaiyr khaadya vastuon par nijee khapat vyay yaa shiksha or swasthya par vyay?alpiji ke istemaal ke bare main kya kahenge? connactivity kii baat karen to pakki sadak ko bahut acha sanketak mana jaataa he
 Why banks are included in financial inclusion? Why not to the post office? What about the number of policemen? i am not suggesting that any one or the other of these factors should have been included, or that the group of factors the committee accepted should be rejected
 main to yah bindu uthaa rahaa hum ki in karkon ko shaamil karne yaa unako khaarij karne par kuch charchaa honi chahie thi
 Has the committee proved any justification for this election? No, yes
 ek or bindu par vichaar karte hai
 Development means growth
 duusare sanketakon ke liye yaa to aap vruddhi ko dekh sakate hai yaa uski sampurna vailu ko
 For example, i can consider neonatal mortality, or i can look at improvement in neonatal mortality
 in donon main se main koun-sa vikalp chunata hum, uske aadhaar par ranking main antar aa jayega
 Yes, according to the increment, the improvement ultimately affects the base
 lekin kya mujhe inkrement kii tulana vruddhi se yaa vruddhi kii tulana base se kerani chahie? main kahana yah chahta hum ki is tarah kii kavayad main ahm faisla lenaa hota he, isliye kaaphi chaukanna rahanaa chahie
 If you consider the ten factor groups selected, then nine can improve (or erode) after a while
 lekin essi / asti ke pratishat main is tarah se badlaav nahin hota
 Stagnation in SC / ST population can be seen in some states
 ab aankadon ke strot par vichaar karte hai
 Let's take the example of education
 is maamle main aankade rashtriya namoona surveykshan karyaalay (eneseso) se liye jate hai
 The issue is that large-scale NSSO sample surveys are usually done every five years
 kya koi base aise aankadon ke aadhaar par tay kiya ja saktaa he jo paanch saal ke baad uplabdh honge?cameti chaahati to schuli shiksha ke liye shiksha par jila soochna vyavastha se har saal milane vaale behtareen aankadon kaa istemaal kar sakati thi
 Apart from this, statistics about many other factors are taken from the census
 iskaa matlab yah he ki agle aankade das saal baad hi uplabdh honge
 The selection that really surprised me is the neonatal mortality rate (IMR), which is the only indicator of health
 isse mujhe hairaani is vajah se hui he kyonki pichhlaa swasthya surveykshan 2005-06 main kiya gaya tha
 When i look at the source of the data, it says, "sample Registration System Bulletin, October 2012
" ’’ thik he
 The SRS Bulletin contains IMR figures of states
 lekin ye sirf anumaan hai
 It is better to use it for estimation only
 acadmic dridhtaa ke hisaab se aavashyaktaa is baat kii thi ki saaf taur par ullekh kiya jaataa ki ye sirf anumaan hai, survey par aadhaarit vaastavik aankade nahin
 i did not find any mention of it in the report
 samanyikaran ke bare main kya kahenge? kisi bhi tareeke se yah spasht he ki jansankhya kaa samanyikaran anivaary rup se bhugolic ilaake ke samanyikaran se shreshth he
 Talking about weights, PCA (principal Component Analysis) is better because the waiting system is prepared by practice
 hamen yah bataaya gaya ki samaan wates kaa istemaal kiya gaya he kyonki unhen samajhnaa aasaan hota he
 i do not think the facility of understanding should have been any criterion
 yadi ise maandand maan len to maujuuda kavayad ko samajhnaa aasaan nahin he
 It smells of arbitrariness and partiality
 in sabko dekhte hue, yah tay karne kaa kya koi saaf rasta najar nahin aata he ki raghuram rajan report main tulanaatmak rup se gujarat kaa pradarshan kharaab kyon rahaa he? ji nahin, kyonki report se koi bhi bina vishleshan vaale aankade nahin milte
 On the whole, the attitude of this entire report seems to boast of haughtiness

 The police said that the hard disk police has not yet recovered, which contains the original videos
 police ne kaha ki vaise bhi sandip kumaar jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Hearing the police's plea, the court increased Sandeep's police custody for a day
 police sandip ko lekar maukey par pahunchipulice vidhayak sandip kumaar ko lekar sultanpuri ke epa block main pahunchi
 The police investigated the house where the CD is alleged to have been made

 Actually, today is the last day of Sandeep Kumar's three-day remand
 nahin mila koi sabutasutron ke mutabik dilli ke purv mantri sandip kumaar ke sahyogi praveen or mahipal ke khilaaf bhi police ko jaanch main abhi tak koi saboot haath nahin laga he
 So far no other woman has given any complaint against Sandeep Kumar to the police
 nahin mila video banane vaala gagetpulice kaa kahana he ki sandip kumaar jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Police have recovered some digital devices from Sandeep's capture
 jinamein unka mobile phone bhi shaamil hai
 All devices are being investigated
 haalanki police ko abhi tak vah gajet nahin mila he, jisase sex video shoot kiya gaya tha
 Police notice to social media sites: Delhi Police has also sent a notice to all social sites after the sex video related to Sandeep Kumar went viral on social media

 On Tuesday, the alleged video of Sandeep Kumar was also made viral on Twitter

 After which the accused MLA Sandeep Kumar, seeing himself being surrounded all-round in the case, reached the DCP office of outer Delhi and surrendered
 mahila kaa aarope tha ki sandip ne use nashila cold drink pilaakar uske saath duraachaar kiya tha
 Accused of raping on the pretext of ration card, a woman, seen in a sex CD with former Delhi government minister Sandeep Kumar, reached the Sultanpuri police station in Delhi on Saturday and registered a case of rape against Sandeep
 mahila kaa aarope tha ki vah rashan card banavaane kii khatir aap vidhayak sandip kumaar ke paas gai thi
 At that time, Sandeep Kumar had given the woman a cold drink by mixing intoxicating substances
 uske baad vahaan uske saath jo kuch bhi hua use pataa nahin chalaa
 When he regained consciousness, he understood the whole matter
 havas, ranginiyaan, besharmi
 These are the words that, on hearing, a picture of a fallen person flashes in the mind
 yakeenan in lafzon se kisi sadhu-sant, pujari or baba kaa koi vaasta nahin ho saktaa
 But wait
 
 
 ham aapako hindustan ke kuch aise baabaaon ke bare main bataa rahe hai, jo havas or ranginiyon main is kadar duube ki unki karatootein dekh kar vishwaas kii najuk door se bandhe haath khul gaye or ab aise besharm baabaaon kii pherarist lambii hoti ja rahi he
 Who are deceiving you by disguising Baba in your society
 mahilaon kii izzat ko taar-taar kar rahe hai
 The Great Indian Baba Shokbhi Asaram Bapu, sometimes Falhari Baba, sometimes Zakir Naik and sometimes Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 ye sabake sab da great indianbabasho ke sitare hai
 Not twinkling stars but twinkling stars
 inaki chamak-damak inaki thasak, inkaa aura sab kuch inke karmon ne inase chin liya he
 All these are now left as hypocrites and hypocrites
 jo har roj apni maryaada kho rahe hai
 Who are shattering the faith between God and devotee every moment
 babagiri kii dukanapako da great indian baba sho ke kalakaaron se milaate hai
 Let us introduce them
 vaise to india main ek se ek baba pade hue hai
 But we will only tell you about those Babas who pretended to be God and could not even become fully human
 jo lagaataar hamaare mulk ke lakhon-karodon maasoom logon kii aasthaa or akidat se khelte rahe
 Who all the time continued to run Babagiri shop
 har taraf baba hi babad great indian baba sho main ek se bad kar ek baba hai
 Star Baba super star baba
 High Profile Baba
 lo profil baba
 Aashiq Mizaz Baba nautankibaz baba
 Rangarsiya Baba shararti baba
 Hoshiar Baba and one and half Hoshiar Baba
 or to or balaatkaari baba
 Even the killer Baba
 sex racket chalaane vaale baba
 That is, Baba sold for kilos
 jail ke baahar baba
 Baba inside the jail
 baabaaon ke charnon main bhaktasachamuch ye desh baabaaon se bharaa padaa he
 Ranging from a treasure of crores
 
 The hearts and minds of a large population are occupied by these Babas
 baba ishaara karte nahin ki duniya charnon main lot jaati he
 Wealth, honor, fame, honor, fame, sensation and everything are all on the footsteps of these Babas
 or baba hai ki apane bhakton kii isi bholepan kaa faaydaa uthaa kar ek se bad kar ek gul khilaa rahe hai
 Different types of Babakoi Baba are dancing
 koi nagin dance kar rahaa he
 Someone is swinging with girls
 to koi bistar par apni shishyaa ke saath athkheliyaan kar rahaa he
 So someone is enjoying a bath with the girls in the swimming pool
 had he kya naam raushan kar rahe hai aap sab baba
 Shameful misdeeds that do road raid actions and blasphemies
 baabaaon kaa jhooth bhakton ke liye sachinke liye umada hujum dekhie
 See the trust of the devotees
 unki bhakthi dekhie
 Look at their faith
 ye bhakton kaa apane bhagwaan ke liye yakeen he jo unhen uske dar tak khinchaa laata he
 Now listen to their word of God
 pravachan suniye
 Listen to the truth bolvachan suniye
 His words are true and true only for these thousands of millions of devotees
 sach ke sivaa kuch nahin
 Babalekine runs shops of devotion, but these new babas of The Great Indian Baba Show have blown away the truth that lie was lying
 duniyaadaari, sansar, moh-maada sab se dur hone kaa daawa karne vaale in baabaaon ne aise-aesegul khilaaehain ki kisi shaitan ko bhi sharminda kar jaaen
 But here all of them are in disguise of Baba
 bhakthi kii badi-badi dukaanon ke maalik hai
 moh-maya, the colloquial gurus to take away from indulgence
 vaaki kamaal he
 The need is to know their truth

 Confident, these youth are challenging the established institutions with full power in every field and making their own way

 These youths also proudly express their caste identity unlike previous generations
 yah bahut kuch vaisaa hi he jab america main ashweton ne khel se lekar geet-sangeet, film vagairah main apane dhamaakedaar pradarshnon se jhande gadwe shuru kiye the or goron ko chunauti dene ke liye 'blike ij beautiphul' kaa naaraa diya tha
 The outstanding example of this is 17-year-old Dalit folk singer of Jalandhar, Gurkanwal Bharti alias Ginni Mahi
 pehali dfa jab aath saal kii ginni ko punjab ke ek gaanv main gaanaa gane ke liye manch par chadhaaya gaya tha to logon kaa hujum dekh ghabrahat main uski ankhen band ho gai thim
 He finished the song as soon as he closed his eyes

 The caste for which he was discriminated against, made him his strength
 usee tarah jaise america main ashweton ne 'blike ij beautiphul' kaa naaraa diya
 Similarly, Donta Prashant, a resident of Choppadandi in Telangana, was afraid to make his details public about a decade and a half ago
 unhen sankoch hota tha
 Prashant of the Dalit community loves cricket very much
 lekin bachapan main jab koi savarna baccha uske saath cricket kheltaa to uske abhibhavak jamkar daant lagaate
 But after completing his twelfth from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Prashant came to Hyderabad Central University for higher education as if he got a new identity
 ab 27 saal ke ho chuke prashanth bina kisi sankoch yaa bhay ke apni baat yaa saamaajik prishthbhumi logon ke saamne rakhte hai
 His speeches in fluent English are highly effective
 prashanth kehete hai, ''darasal, ambedkar students association (eyese) ne mere bheetar atmasamman or aatmavishvaas jagaaya
 He provided a platform for expression
 ''yah ikkisvin sadi kii peedi he, jisane apni jatigat pahchaan se upar uthakar jeena sikh liya he, or aaj uske liye kuch myne rakhata he to vah he uskaa vajood

 Experts consider the participation of Dalits in education as a major reason for change

 4 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he or yah 2001 janaganana kii dar 54
 Increased from 7 to 66
 1 ho gai he
 Thorat also believes that the reason for this change in Dalits is economic strength due to education and job participation
 ve kehete hai, ''shiksha or naukariyon main daliton kii bhagidaari badaae se unamem himmat badi he
 If any injustice happens, millions of people come forward
 jaisaa rohit vemula or gujarat ke maamle main hua
 "the spirit of free singing is also seen in other areas
" masalan, punjab main kathith ''ambedkar fok yaa chamaar pop'' ubharkar aayaa he, or ginni maahi uski jhandabardaar bani hui hai
 His two albums so far have been Gurpurab Hai Kanshi Wale The and Guran Di Deewani
 utyub par inke 50,000 se 75,000 vyuu hai
 His songs have a glimpse of Punjabi folk songs and the messages of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Guru Ravidas
 ve us peedi kii pratik hai jinhone ambedkar ke sandeshon ko sirf kitabon main padhakar bhulaayaa nahin balki unhen apane or dusron kaa jivan badalane kaa mantra mana he
 That's why i Fan Baba Saheb's song has got 65,000 views on youtube
 ve kahati hai, ''aaj hamaare sabhi adhikaar baba sahib kii dein hai
 i can read, sing, do whatever i want
 maine baba sahib kii soch ke saath shuruyaat kii he or ise aage badhanaa chaahuungi
 Ginni's father works in air ticketing and mother is a housewife
 unke do chote bhai hai
 The tradition of such songs in Punjab dates back to the 1980s, but the kind of nationwide popularity and success Ginni gained was impossible-to-date some time back
 ek dalit gayak bataate hai, ''1980-90 ke dashak main hamaare liye chijen itani aasaan nahin thim
 Social media and the Internet have changed lives
 koi bhi apni baat rakhane ke liye aaazaad he
 It took me ten years to get my first cassette out

 His songs have up to 5 million views on youtube

 However Sufi singer Hansraj Hans believes that caste identity should not be allowed in singing
 ve kehete hai, ''jisane bhi samaaj ko jati main baanta, vah shaatir, jaalim or paapi rahaa hoga
 Our misfortune is that every shay is being distributed, music is left, it should not be distributed

 unki film fundry main jati ke janjaal main uljhe kishor kii ekatarfa prem kahani he to sarat uskaa vistaar he
 It portrays the girl's character in a powerful way
 isi vajah se rinku raajaguru ko 2015 ke rashtriya film puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 The role that Fundri created became the basis of Sairat
 4 karod ru
 Sairat, which was made in Mumbai, has spent Rs 80 crore se zyada kaa kaarobaar kiya
 Thanks to strong storytelling and good direction, it became one of the most successful regional language films
 aakhir isamen aisa kya tha? manjule ne film kii safalataa par kaha tha, ''meri filmon main asal jindagi kii baaten hai
 Tamil director Pa Ranjith has also done the work of showing this rage in the society
 unhone rajnikant jaise bade sitare ko lekar kabali banaai or daliton kii aawaaj buland kii
 They believe that it is not easy to make a film with a social message in mainstream cinema
 unke mutabik, ''hamen aisi filmein banane kii jarurat he jinamein saamaajik sandesh ke saath vyavsaayik kamyaabi hasil karne kii kuwwat bhi ho

 prashanth kehete hai, ''dalit yuva ab har kshetra main kamyaabi hasil kar rahe hai
 But this success of Dalits is hurting the upper caste Hindus
 tina daabi ko bhi top karne ke baad kai phek acounts se trol kiya gaya
 Tina hails from a financially strong family and her parents are both engineers

 Chandrakhan Prasad, mentor and author of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI), which recently launched the Dalit Foods brand, says, "while the second generation Dalits are divided into government and private jobs, the third generation educated Young Dalits are no longer dependent on government jobs

 Prashant says, "there is a presence of Dalit youth in student politics but they lack in leadership
 dalit chaatro ke masale baakiyon se alag hai
 Many student organizations do not take up Dalit issues properly or give them leadership, hence the need of Dalit own organizations

 But as soon as the video of this incident went viral, it was as if socio-political earthquake occurred

 However, the movement of Dalits in Una was spontaneous and there was a collective participation of Dalit youth

 kai baar doctoron ko bhi iske bare main jaankaree nahin hoti he or ve bhi ise periods ke dauraan hone vaala saamaanya dard samajhate hai
 Endometriosis is a problem in which a tissue (tissue) found inside the uterus grows and spreads outside the uterus
 yah utak andashay, fallopian tub yaa garbhashay ke bahari hisson main or anya aantarik hisson main fail saktaa he
 Severe pain during menstruation can occur when endometriosis occurs

 Often women do not get to know this disease until they go through a pregnancy

 Scars on the uterus cause trouble in the process of fertilizing the egg and pregnancy cannot take place

 Endometriosis is not a lifestyle-related disease

 Talking of giving extra relief of Rs 5 lakhs, many people have their faces blossomed
 vaaki tex ke lihaaj se yah atirikt raahat kaaphi acchhee khabar he, lekin iske bare main kai tarah ke bhram bane hue hai jise aapako dur kar lenaa chahie
 What is the provision? First of all, let us know what provision has been given by the Finance Minister to give additional tax exemption on home loans
 asal main abhi tak home lone ke principal amount or interest donon ke reepement par tex bachaane kii suvidha milti he
 1 annually on the principal amount of the home loan under section 80C of the Income Tax Act
 5 lakh rupee tak didction kii suvidha milti he, yani itani rakam ko aap apni texable inakam se gata sakate hai
 Similarly, under Section 24B of Income Tax, tax rebate is available on interest of home loan up to Rs 2 lakh
 ab vitt mantri ne kaha ki ek alag dhara 80EEA tahat 45 lakh rupee tak ke makaan par 1
 An additional rebate of Rs 5 lakh will be available on the home loan interest payment
 is tarah ab saal main aap 3
 Home loans paid up to Rs 5 lakh can get tax rebate against interest
 is praavdhaan main kya nayaa hatax export balavant jain ne kaha, 'is praavdhaan main ek acchhee baat yah he ki yah phayda nirmaanadhin yaa taiyaar donon tarah ke makaan kharidne ke liye liye jane vaale lone par milegaa
 Yes, one thing to note is that the interest that a man pays on a loan taken on a house of 45 lakh will be up to three and a half lakh rupees in a year that he will be able to take full advantage of this provision
 is praavdhaan kaa phayda 45 lakh rupee kii keemat tak ke makaan par hi milegaa
 That is, even if the maximum loan amount is 90 percent, then it will be about 40 lakh rupees
 'ye hai pech jinase kuch logon ko ho sakati he niraashaavitt mantri kii is ghoshnaa main ek pech yah he ki yah ki yah 1 april 2019 se 31 march 2020 tak ke bich yani ek saal kii is avadhi main liye jane vaale lone par hi milegaa
 That is, your loan should be approved during this period, even if the house registry is later
 iskaa matlab yah he ki puraane home lone dharakon ko iskaa koi phayda nahin milegaa, yani bahut se logon ko is praavdhaan se niraashaa hi hogi
 This provision has been made to encourage new people to buy houses
 kya sirf 15 saal ke lone par milegaa phayda?balavant jain ne bataaya, 'bajet dastavej main isaki koi charchaa nahin he ki yah sirf 15 saal ke lone par milegaa, yah phayda zyada avadhi ke lone par bhi mil saktaa he

 On Thursday, 31 May, in New Delhi, when Union Oil and Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called an emergency meeting of his ministry officials and top officials of public sector oil companies, there was a concern on his face
 desh ke logon main gussa bhadak rahaa tha or yah kuch hisson tathaa soshal media main zyada tha
 Due to the government's failure to control the rise in oil prices, the opposition parties were sounding havoc

 As per the change in the world market prices in the dynamic pricing policy, the prices in the domestic market also fluctuate daily
 lekin baithak main inamen se kisi par bhi faisla nahin ho paaya
 Experts say that at this time the minister has nothing to do

 But she cannot even let the prices of oil continue to rise steadily and give the impression that she is not doing anything

 When Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister in May 2014, crude oil prices were hovering near $ 100 a barrel
 petrol tab dilli main 71 ru

 Due to the good fortune of the government, crude oil prices in the international market started falling sharply since September 2014
 us samay ve 97 dollar prati bairal thim or 14 janvari 2016 ko 30 dollar prati bairal
 This was the first time in the past 12 years that oil prices had fallen so sharply
 haalanki petrol kii keemten us maheene dilli main kuch samay ke liye 59 ru
 And Rs 66 in Mumbai

 When crude oil prices were falling, the government was getting double benefits, both from lower import prices and higher excise duty on fuel

 An economist from Delhi said, "most of this benefit was given to the employees of the states (under the 14th Finance Commission) and the central government (under the 7th Central Pay Commission) but the fiscal position of the central government also improved because interest payments
 And subsidies were gradually controlled

 a trade deficit occurs when the total value of goods and services imported exceeds the total value of its exports

 On the fiscal side, the effect will be that the government will have to cut excise duty and heavily subsidize oil companies to sell LPG and kerosene at prices below market price
 agar kachche tel kii keemat ko 65 dollar prati bairal lagaakar chalem, to isse sakal rajkoshiya ghaataa jidipi ke anupaat main 10-12 aadhaar ankon tak bad jayega
 One basis point is equal to one hundredth of a percentage point

 Third, the rise in oil prices may increase inflation and will also impact other micro indicators
 joshi ke mutabik, "agar motaa-motaa hisaab lagaaein to kachche tel main prati bairal 10 dollar kii keemat kii vruddhi se jidipi ke pratishat ke rup main bharat kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa 8 aadhaar ank bad saktaa he or usee tarah chaalu khaataa ghaataa 40 aadhaar ank bad saktaa he yadi baaki chijen aparivartit rahen
 In the budgetary calculations Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made in the last budget, he kept oil prices stable
 pichley vitt varsh main, bharat ne 213
 9 metric tons of crude oil was imported and 5 for this
 6 lakh karod rupee kharch kiye
 The average price was around $ 55 per barrel
 haalanki, pipiasi kii haalia gananaa se pataa chalata he ki kachche tel kii keemat 70-80 dollar prati dollar prati bairal kii range main pahunch jaae, to bharat ko utana hi tel kharidne ke liye lagbhag 2 lakh karod ru
 Additional expenses may be incurred
 is asar ko samaapt karne ke liye bharat nae tel niryaatkon ke saath-saath aise deshon kii talash main bhi he jo kachche tel ke badale dollar kii jagah vibhinn prakaar ke bhugtan sweekaar kar len
 For example, Iran and Iraq take payments in euros
 ve tel ke kaarobaar main bharat ke sabase adhik bharosemand vyapaarik saajhedaar ban rahe hai or dollar main bhugtan lene vaale saudi arab par se hamaari nirbharta lagaataar ghat rahi he
 What the government can do is thus clear that curbing the rising oil prices is necessary not only to handle public outrage but also to keep the arithmetic of government money and to keep the economy in good shape
 lekin sarkaar ke saamne vikalp kya hai or sarkaar un vikalpon kii ore jaaegi, isaki kya sambhaavnaaen hai? tel kii keemton ko ghataane kaa ek rasta he ki unhen vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 According to Joshi, "the highest rate of tax in GST is only 28 percent, which is much lower than the rate of current taxes on oil
 '' tel utpaadon ko jiesti main laane kii maujuuda bahes ke bich yah bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isse rajya sarkaron kii aay ghategi or un par atirikt dabaav aa jayega lekin philhal to yah ek prastaav bhar hi he
 Furthermore, it can be a disruptive step that the government does not want at the moment
 doosraa, bharat ke sabase bade gharelu tel utpaadak ko bataanaa ki usne kachche tel kii keemton main kami ke dauraan baari munafa kamaaya he or abhi vah rifineriyon main kam keemat par tel beche
 In return, the government compensates the firm by asking for a lower dividend from this year
 aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki sarkaar oenjasi par baari kar lagane kaa man bana rahi he
 Parikh, however, says that he is against taxing the firm because "taxing ONGC is exactly the same as the government levying tax on itself
" ''teesraa he, tel ko philhal ho rahi asian premium main kharid ke sthaan par kisi discount form main kharida jaae
 This would require a very large level of bargaining with these countries
 pradhan jaisaa daawa kar rahe hai ki ve vibhinn tel utpaadak deshon kii yatra karke sambandh majboot kar rahe hai to aise main yah aashaa he ki ve aapurtikarta deshon ko daam ghataane ke liye manaayenge
 The government is reluctant to reduce the excise duty as it fears that it may affect its social schemes
 doosraa vikalp rajyon ko waite main katautee karne ke liye dabaav daalana he
 The non-bjp ruled state of Kerala recently raised 1 Rs
 tak waite kam kar diya he, jisase iske vaarshik rajasav main 500 karod ru
 Has been cut
 lekin rajya kisi bhi katautee par vichaar se pehle samay le rahe hai jo centre ke maathe par bal daal rahaa he
 At present, the government is skeptical about oil prices
 vah na to apana rajasav ganvaane kii sthiti main he jisane ise rajkoshiya santulan banane main sahaayta kii he or na hi tel kii badhati keemton par aankh mundakar baith sakati he
 The general election has less than a year and it cannot give the Opposition a chance to attack such issues
 yah sarkaar kii chintaa ko darshata he or doorgaami vikalpon ko khangaalane kaa ishaara karata he
 After all, the high oil prices were also among the weapons that Modi has used to gain power over the Manmohan government
 lekin ab upachunaavon main unki party ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 It is likely that the government will wait a little longer and in the meantime it will try to come down to oil prices and agree to reduce the tax of more states or to make the states agree to bring the fuel under GST

 "he said," These procedures (exercise of formation of separate Telangana state) by the government will weaken the country
 ’ hajaare ne kaha ki desh kii maujuuda badahaali kisi se chhipi nahin he
 He is taking out a Janatantra Yatra in order to make people aware of choosing clean and good people in Parliament and sending them to Parliament
 unhone kaha ki baba ramdev or arvind kejariwal ke alag hone ke baavjood janatantr yatra ko vyapak jansamarthan mil rahaa he
 Hazare made it clear that no one included in his team will contest elections, instead all of them will continue to serve the country

 The social worker said that the struggle for the Jan Lokpal will continue in the same way as he fought for the Public Information Act for 10 years

 Funds are still being raised in this manner, but in the new political situation, the way the parties raise funds has changed
 jamaana badla or digital lenden kaa chalan badha he jise siyaasi partiyaan bhi bhunaa rahi hai
 Crowdfunding has become a new way to raise funds online
 vahiin chunaav ladane ke maujuuda chalan ko burjua rasta bataane vaali bhartiya communist party (sipiai) ke ummidavaar kanhaiya kumaar croudfnding ke jariye chande kii apil kar chuke hai
 But questions are being raised about his move
 kya he croudfndingshiksha, swasthya, dharmik or raajnneetik muhim ke liye bazaar se paisa jutaney ke tamaam tareeke hai
 One of them is crowdfunding
 fund jutaney kaa yah bhi ek tarika he
 Crowdfunding is the process of raising small amounts from the public for a particular project, business venture or social welfare
 iske liye online plateform yaa soshal netwarking kaa rasta apanaaya jaataa he
 In this, the fund-raising gives potential donors or investors a reason for raising the fund
 isamen daankartaaon ke samaksh apane makasad ke bare main bataanaa hota he
 There is also a complete description of how they can contribute to this campaign
 niyam kanoon ke mutabik equity aadhaarit croudfnding gaiyr-kanoonee he
 But peer-to-peer lending is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 sebi kii najrabaharhaal, bazaar niamak sanstha sebi (SEBI) ne croud funding par nae niyam jari kiye hai
 The new rules will help new companies to raise funds and prevent misuse of such channels
 niyam bataate hai ki keval sebi se panjikrut sansthaaon ko hi croudfnding plateform pradaan kiye jaaenge
 Through this, companies can raise up to Rs 10 crore annually
 fund jutaney ke nae madhyam se jude khatre ko dekhte hue sebi ne prastaav pesh kiya he ki keval manyata praapt niveshkon ko hi croud funding gatividhiyon main shirkat karne kii anumati hogi
 Listed companies in the market, real estate business and financial sector companies will not be able to participate
 koun-koun partiyaan le raheen madadsaamudayik croudfnding main daan or puraskaar aadhaarit croudfnding shaamil he
 It is completely legal
 saamaajik kalyaan ke liye aajkal yah fund jutaney kaa sabase lokapriy tarika he
 Crowdfunding websites usually charge a fee to use their platform
 inaki madad se behad kam samay main kaaphi fund juta liya jaataa he
 The crowdfunding company has been supported by parties called the bourgeoisie such as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, DMK and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 lekin bihar ke begusarai se bhartiya communist party (sipiai) ke ummidavaar kanhaiya kumaar bhi croudfnding ke liye ourdemocracy
 Taking the help of in and it is being told that they have now got 30 lakh rupees as donation
 bharat main milaap, kioto jaise kai croudfnding diggaj aa chuke hai
 New economics of political donations: BJP is now at the forefront of getting political donations
 vah desh kii sabase dhani raajnneetik party bhi he
 Firstly this party started this work through the Namo app for micro funding and Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally started it by donating one thousand rupees
 unhone baqayda twit kar apil kii ki, 'bijepi ke liye narendra modi app ke jariye daan karen
 i appeal to all of you to contribute through the app and give a message of transparency in public life
 aap narendra modi app ke jariye 5 rupee se lekar 1000 rupee tak daan kar sakate hai
 'BJP leaders also describe this campaign as a way to connect voters to the party
 vahiin aam aadmi party bhi online madhyamon se raajnneetik chanda jutati rahi he
 After this campaign of these two parties in the country, other political parties have also adopted this path
 kanoonon main badlaav se chunaav ayog chintitagauratlab he ki raajnneetik dalon ko agyaat sroton se funding kii maatra bahut zyada hoti he, lekin elactoral bond se bhi isamen koi fark nahin aayaa he
 Audit reports of political parties of the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) show that 66 per cent of the donations received by national political parties during 2004-05 to 2017-18 come from unknown sources
 elactoral bond ko supreme court main chunauti di gai he or is par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Election Commission has also expressed concern about the electoral bond
 supreme court main ayog kaa kahana he ki raajnneetik chande se jude kai kanoonon main badlaav ke paardarshita par 'gambhir parinaam' honge
 The Commission said that the change in the 'FCRA 2010' law would allow political parties to receive foreign funds without investigation, which could affect Indian policies from foreign companies
 sheersh adaalat main halafanama daayar karne vaale chunaav ayog ne kaha ki 26 may 2017 ko usne vidhi evam nyaay mantralay ko patr likhakar apane is najariye se avgat karaayaa tha ki iskar kanoon janpratinidhitiv kanoon or vitt kanoon main badlaav raajnneetik dalon ke chande main paardarshita ke khilaaf honge
 China on Thursday expressed concern over India's plan to build 54 new border outposts in Arunachal Pradesh, saying India should not complicate the situation and take more steps to maintain peace as it is a disputed area
 bharat vietnam kii dosti se baukhalaayaa china
 
 
 Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujin was questioned about the Home Ministry's announced plan to construct 54 new border posts along the border of Arunachal Pradesh
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane report kaa sangyaan liya he
 There is still dispute over the eastern border of china-india
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham ummid karte hai ki bharat halaat ko jatil banane vaale kadam uthaane kii bajaay simavarti ilaakon main sthirataa or shanti barkaraar rakhane main madad kaa prayaas karegaa
 The official news agency Xinhua on Yang's monthly press conference did not mention Arunachal Pradesh in its report and cited it as South Tibet
 china arunachal ko dakshini tibet bataata he
 On the question as to why China is concerned about India's structural development to improve the standard of living around the border, while China has done a lot of development work on its side, Yang said, "I think the roads you are talking about They are in the eastern part of china-india which is still a disputed area
 ’unhone kaha, ‘is kshetra main vivaad par china kii sthiti spasht or satat he
 'china claims Arunachal Pradesh as southern Tibet
 yang ne kaha, ‘vaastavik niyantran rekha par shanti or sthirataa banaae rakhane kii donon pakshon ke bich bani sarvasammati mahatvapurn he
 The Government of India announced last week that it would set up 54 new border outposts and a package of Rs 175 crore was also announced to enhance infrastructural development around the border in Arunachal Pradesh
 arunachal pradesh main simavarti chaukiyon or sadak network par yang kii tippanee chini videsh mantralay dwaara pehle jataae gaye vichaaron ke anuroop hi he
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying had earlier said on this issue that until the final resolution of the boundary question is pending, we expect the Indian side to refrain from taking any action that complicates the question
 inputah bhashaa se Taking a dig at Team Anna, Union Minister Salman Khurshid said that they are raising issues that the Supreme Court has rejected and they can approach the United Nations if they do not believe in them
 kanoon mantri ne kaha, ‘unhen sanyukt raashtra ko patr likhnaa chahie
 What can be more independent than the Supreme Court in India
 ve aise maamalon main nishpaksh jaanch chaahate hai jinhen ucchtam nyaayalay khaarij or naamanzoor kar chukaa he
 Team Anna is seeking to set up an independent inquiry against the 15 Union ministers against whom he has made some allegations
 sarkaar maang ko pehle hi khaarij kar chuki he
 Team Anna started an indefinite strike demanding the formation of a strong Lokpal and a special team to probe corruption against Union ministers
 team anna party pramukhon or saansadon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamalon kii twarit jaanch fast trek adaalat se karaane kii bhi maang kar rahi he
 Rejecting the team's allegation that the government is not serious about getting the Lokpal Bill passed, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said that the proposed legislation is being reviewed by the Select Committee of Parliament
 unhone kaha, ‘vidheyak loksabhaa main paarit ho chukaa he
 It has been brought to the Rajya Sabha which is necessary
 185 se zyada sanshodhan hai
 There has been much debate on this
 ise paarit nahin kiya ja sakaa

 Nitish said that on the basis of principle he had broken with the NDA, as long as the NDA was following the path created by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and on the condition of not bringing the disputed issue and the disputed person (narendra Modi) as per the agreement Was, then the alliance was going well
 magar unhone apana rasta badal liya, to gathbandhan se alag rahanaa hi behatar samajha
 He said that he cannot accept communal politics

 After the incident of firing on the farmers in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, it has started to raise the issue of the rights of the farmers out loud

 At the Bawana rally, Ajay Maken attacked the Modi government fiercely and said that the government which talked about the rights of the farmers, did not even waive the debt of Rs 70
 jabaki upie sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa 70 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kiya tha
 Only waiving the debt of industrialists Modi, while attacking the central government, Maken said that Prime Minister Modi can forgive the debt of 1 lakh 54 thousand crores of his industrialist friends but he does not see the loan of poor and poor farmers
 upie sarkaarne alag alag fasalon ke nunatam samarthan mulya main teen alag alag baar ijapha kiya tha jabaki centre sarkaar ne pichley teen saalon main sirf 50 rupye badaye hai
 Congress has always been with the poor, said that when the farmers-poor-laborers-tribals have been attacked in the country, then the Congress has stood with them

 fasebuk pej ‘amit shah phans team’ ne dhoni kaa ek photo aplod kar daawa kiya ki “mahendra singh dhoni hue bhaajapa main shaamil, lard sakate hai chunaav, swaagat nahin karoge maahi bhai kaa”

 kochi main khele gaye duusare ekadivasiy mukaable main england par prabhaavshaalee jeet darj karne ke baad bhartiya cricket team captain mahendra singh dhoni ke grihnagar ranchi main he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian team will play in Ranchi on Saturday and its sole objective will be to win the first international cricket match in the captain's city
 echisi international cricket stadium complex main hone vaale is match ko jitkar bhartiya team paanch maichon kii is shrunkhlaa main 2-1 kii badhat hasil kar sakati he or varshon se is ahm kshan kaa intjaar kar rahe ranchivasiyon ko shandaar tohfa de sakati he
 There have been international matches in Jamshedpur before in Jharkhand, but the capital Ranchi got a chance to host such for the first time
 kochi main saraahneey pradarshan ke baad bhartiya team kii mushkilen kuch kam hoti dikh rahi hai
 The way the batsmen performed under the leadership of captain Dhoni is a commendable compliment, but the failure of the top order is still a year for the team
 yahi ek paksh he, jise lekar bharat beete ek saal se chintit rahaa he
 Given the moisture in the weather, swing and seam bowlers in Ranchi are also likely to get help
 aise main kochi main teen wicket lekar england ke sheersh kram ko dharashayi karne vaale bhubaneshwar kumaar se phir ek baar chamakdaar pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 Since an international match is being held for the first time in Ranchi, nothing much has been said and written about the pitch
 aise main captain ko team sangyojan ko lekar sachet rahanaa hoga
 However, the chances of change in the winning team in Kochi are less visible
 kochi main rabindra jadeja kaa harfanmaulaa pradarshan bharat ke liye khushi kii khabar lekar aayaa he
 The Indian team, which has been battling a shortage of all-rounders for years, has gained new confidence with Jadeja's confidence
 ummid he ki jadeja apana yah pradarshan ranchi or aane vaale maichon main bhi jari rakhenge
 The England team batted well and bowled in Rajkot, but their batsmen could not perform at the Kochi ODI level
 tippaniyan The situation in England is unlike that of India
 uski salaami jodi lagaataar acha pradarshan karti rahi he, lekin kochi main uske naakaam hone ke baad team lay se bhatak gai
 Now in Ranchi, captain Alastair Cook and Ian Bell will once again try to give the team a good start
 jahaan tak gendbaaji kaa sawaal he, to kochi main pari ke madhyantar tak acchhee lay main dikh rahe english gendbaaj antim samay main lay se bhatakate dikhe, jiskaa phayda dhoni or jadeja ne uthaaya tathaa bharat ko acha score diya
 The English bowlers have performed well and are expected to return to their rhythm
 captain cook ko yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki bharat main unke gendbaajon kii safalataa kii guarantee bahut kam rahati he, kyonki yahaan kii pichen sapaat or ballebaajon ko madad pahunchane vaali hoti hai, lihaaja vah apane ballebaajon ke pradarshan par adhik se adhik ashrith rahen to zyada behatar hoga
 By winning this match at the HEC International Cricket Stadium Complex, the Indian team can take a 2–1 lead in this five-match series and give a wonderful gift to the Ranchi people who have been waiting for this crucial moment for years
 jharkhand main isse pehle jamshedpur main antarrashtriya match hue hai, lekin rajdhani ranchi ko pehali baar is tarah kii mejabani kaa mauka mila he
 After a commendable performance in Kochi, the Indian team seems to have some problems
 captain dhoni ke netritv main ballebaajon ne jis tarah kaa pradarshan kiya tha, vah kaabile tarif he, lekin sheersh kram kii naakaami ab bhi team ko saal rahi he
 This is the only aspect about which India has been concerned for the last one year
 mausam main nami ko dekhte hue ranchi main bhi swing or seem gendbaajon ko madad milane ke asaar hai
 In such a situation, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who smashed England's top order with three wickets in Kochi, will once again be expected to perform brightly
 ranchi main chunki pehali baar kisi antarrashtriya match kaa aayojan ho rahaa he, lihaaja pich ko lekar zyada kuch nahin kaha or likhaa gaya he
 In such a situation, the captain has to be careful about team composition
 vaise kochi main jeet hasil karne vaali team main parivartan ke asaar kam dikhaai de rahe hai
 Ravindra Jadeja's all-round performance in Kochi has brought news of happiness for India
 saalon se adad harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii kami se jujh rahi bhartiya team ko jadeja ke aatmavishvaas se nayaa aatmavishvaas mila he
 It is expected that Jadeja will continue his performance in Ranchi and the upcoming matches as well
 england kii team ne rajkot main acchhee ballebaaji or gendbaaji kii thi, lekin kochi ekadivasiy main uske ballebaaj stareey pradarshan nahin kar sake the
 The comments england kii sthiti bharat ke ulat he
 His opening pair has been performing consistently well, but the team deviated from the rhythm after his failure in Kochi
 ab ranchi main captain elister cook or ian bel ek baar phir team ko acchhee shuruyaat dene kaa prayaas karenge
 As far as bowling is concerned, the English bowlers, who were in good rhythm till the middle of the innings in Kochi, were seen wandering in the final time, which was taken advantage of by Dhoni and Jadeja and gave India a good score
 english gendbaajon kaa pradarshan stareey rahaa he or is kaaran unke lay main lautne kii ummid he
 Captain Cook has to keep in mind that the guarantee of the success of his bowlers in India is very low, because the pitches here are flat and helpful to the batsmen, so he should be more and more dependent on the performance of his batsmen
 would be better
 jharkhand main isse pehle jamshedpur main antarrashtriya match hue hai, lekin rajdhani ranchi ko pehali baar is tarah kii mejabani kaa mauka mila he
 After a commendable performance in Kochi, the Indian team seems to have some problems
 captain dhoni ke netritv main ballebaajon ne jis tarah kaa pradarshan kiya tha, vah kaabile tarif he, lekin sheersh kram kii naakaami ab bhi team ko saal rahi he
 This is the only aspect about which India has been concerned for the last one year
 mausam main nami ko dekhte hue ranchi main bhi swing or seem gendbaajon ko madad milane ke asaar hai

 The Rajya Sabha chairman has said that some of the issues raised by the parties are not from his constituency
 bataa den ki vipakshi partiyon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki rajyasabha main thik se prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said that in the letter we have received, two main things have been raised
 inamen agar aap bilon kii scrootni kii baat kar rahe hai to jo loksabhaa se paas bill rajyasabha main scrootni ke liye nahin bheje gaye hai, vah unke kaaryakshetra se baahar hai
 At the same time, it was also said that more work is being done in this session than in the rest of the Lok Sabha, this issue is also outside their work area
 venkaiya naidu ne apane jawaab main kaha he ki pichley 5 seshan jiske vah chairman rahe hai, unamem das vidheyak laae gaye hai or in sabhi ko nirdhirit vibhaagon ko bheja gaya he
 Only two have been unanimously passed
 sabhapati ne kaha ki ye sadan par nirbhar karata he ki vah kitne vidheyakon ko cameti main bhejein
 And as far as the session is concerned, it is the government's jurisdiction to decide how long the session is to run
 gauratlab he ki is baar vipaksh kii kai partiyon ne shikaayat kii he ki sadan main bina kisi charchaa ke bill paas kiye ja rahe hai, saath hi select cameti ke paas bhi bilon ko nahin bheja ja rahaa he
 Such an allegation has been made by the opposition in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 mujffarnagar dange kii aag main jhulas chuki samaajawaadee party 'sapa' kii gaadi ko phir se patari par laane kii kaman party mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne sambhaal lee he

 Significantly, the Akhilesh Yadav government, headed by Public Works Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav, does not include Azam Khan, the senior most cabinet minister in charge of the government and in-charge of Muzaffarnagar district
 mulaayam ke in duuton ke kunbe main cabinet mantri ram govind choudhary, balramsingh yadav, rajya mantri shahid manjuur, yogesh pratap singh, ikbaal mahmud, mehboob ali, chitaranjan swaroop ke alaava mantri kaa darja paae virendra singh or sahab singh ko rakhaa gaya he
 All these ministers will go from village to village in the riot affected areas to create an atmosphere of harmony and brotherhood
 muslim dharmaguruon se baatcheet main yah baat ubhar kar saamne ai he ki gaanvon se palaayan kar chuke logon ko vaapasi karakar unke bich bhay khatm kiya jaae taaki ve chaiyn se rah saken
 For this, these ministers will also have the responsibility of taking strict action on the police security and the culprits where necessary
 udhar, cameti main kai aise mantri shaamil hai jinka ajam khan se rishte bahut achche nahin maane jate hai
 It is understood that after Azam's name in Muzaffarnagar violence, SP does not want to pursue him
 biguef or siarpief ke jawan ke video ke baad ab esasabi ke ek jawan kaa dard bhi saamne aayaa he
 The jawan has said that the jawans also have to serve the nation hungry, but the government should also listen to us
 unhone kaha ki hamen duty ke dauraan afasaron ke bivi-bacchon ko paalna padataa he, unhone kaha ki gaanv main log hamaari jameen ko hadap rahe hai kyonki pita bujurg hai
 The jawan supported Tejbahadur's point of view, saying that the jawan cannot come before the people and media to keep his point as it is considered indiscipline
 isajwaanne bhi sachai to bataai lekin apni pahchaan bachaakar
 He told that his old father is ill, he cannot even go to the hospital
 vahiin sthaneey netaa unki jameen par kabja kar rahe hai par vah kuch nahin kar paa rahe hai kyonki vah abhi duty par hai
 Significantly, after the shocking video of BSF jawan Tej Bahadur staggeringly bad food, a complaint box has been opened for discriminating against the soldiers in the security forces
 abhi tak biguef, siarpief or lansnayak ke javaanon kii ore se shikayaton ke video saamne aaen hai

 Reacting strongly against those who put forward Nitish Kumar's name for the post of Prime Minister, the Bihar Chief Minister said on Friday that he feels sad about all these things
 unhone kaha ki aise log unke hitaishi nahin hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reacted to the elevation of his name for this top post, saying, "whoever puts my name forward for the post of Prime Minister is not my best friend
 mujhe in sab baton se dukh hota he
 He said this in an interaction with reporters on the sidelines of a program
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main apane dal ke netaaon kii bayaanbaji par nitish ne kaha, ‘‘yah sab phaltu baat he
 We do not want to speak on this matter
 ’’ It is worth mentioning that JDU veteran leader and Bihar State Planning Board Vice President Harikeshore Singh had said recently that Nitish is a qualified candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 rajg ko unhen pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karnaa chahie
 Nitish has said earlier that he is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister's latest statement comes at a time when religious leaders at Mahakumbh in Allahabad have started mobilization in support of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the country
 lekin bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne is vishay main bhagava party ke netaaon ke kuch bhi kehane par pabandi laga di he
 Significantly, the demand of many BJP leaders to make Modi the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA was opposed by some JDU leaders
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne is sheersh pad ke liye apana naam uchhaale jane par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha, ‘‘jo bhi meraa naam pradhanmantri pad ke liye aage karata he vah meraa hitaishi nahin he
 i feel sad about all these things
 ’’ unhone ek kaarykram se itar samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main yah baat kahi
 On the rhetoric of his party leaders as the prime ministerial candidate, Nitish said, "all this is a useless thing"
 ham is baat par kuch bolnaa nahin chaahate hai
 '' ullekhneey he ki jadyu ke vayovruddh netaa or bihar rajya yojana board ke upaadhyaksh harikishor singh ne beete dinon kaha tha ki nitish pradhanmantri ke pad ke yogya ummidavaar hai

 "according to PTI, a phone agency from the PMO, Varun Gandhi, MP from Sultanpur, said during an event at Adarsh women's College in Bhiwani, Haryana, that he repeatedly voiced the increase in salary of mps and not giving details of assets
 varun ne kaha ki har varg ke karmchaaree apni mehnat or eemaandaaree ke hisaab se vetan badhwaate hai, lekin pichley 10 saalon main saansadon ne keval haath uthavakar 7 baar apana vetan badwa liya
 And when he raised this issue, once he got a call from the PMO, why are you increasing our troubles
 haalanki varun gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki vah pradhanmantri ke abhaari he ki unhone is mudde par kadam uthaaya
 Now the salary of the mps will not only increase with the raising of hands, but the Parliamentary Committee will decide

 Talking about the plight of farmers, Gandhi said that today 40 percent of the farmers in the country take up farming with land, which is illegal
 kyonki aise kisaanon ko naa to sarkaar kii koi madad milti, naa rin miltaa or naa fasal barbaad hone par muaavja miltaa he

 Pawar, who was excited among the mlas, did not consider Maharashtra as Goa; BJP will now tell what is the Shiv Sena's luxury Grand Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai is often the country's top fashion show, but the show that happened here on Monday was unprecedented
 maharashtra kii kursi par kabje ke liye chal rahi jang ke bich shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne shaam ko lagbhag 5 baje apane twitor ke jariye ghoshnaa kii ki grand hayaat main congress-ensipi or shivasena apane vidhayakon kaa saarvajanik parade karavaaegi
 Raut claimed that a total of 162 mlas supporting Maha Vikas Aghadi will be present here
 shaam ke saat bajte-bajte saikadon mediakarmi mumbai ke hayaat hotel ke baahar jam gaye
 The leaders of Maha Vikas Aghadi claimed that more than 162 mlas are present inside the Grand Hotel
 vidhayakon ke is jamaavade ko sharad pavaar, uddhav thakare, ashok chavaan or mallikarjun khadge jaise diggaj netaaon ne sambodhit kiya
 Pawar's boss avatardikhaamuhan The calm-looking Sharad Pawar showed off an aggressive image at the Hyatt Hotel
 teenon partiyon ke vidhayakon ko ek saath jutaney main kaamyaab hone ke badasharad pavarjosh main dikhe
 However, Pawar met PM Modi only a few days ago
 lekin is baithak main bijepi par jamkar barase
 Pawar said that BJP has adopted unconstitutional methods to form a government in Goa but BJP should know that it is not Goa but Maharashtra and the time has come to teach them a lesson
 sharad pavaar ne vidhayakon ko kaha he ki ye galat dharna failaai ja rahi he ki ajit pavaar vip jari karenge or bijepi ke paksh main vot daalane ko kahenge or jo vip nahin maanegaa uski vidhansabha kii sadsyta chali jaaegi
 Pawar rejected this in front of the mlas and said that he himself will ensure that no mla's membership is lost
 sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ko ensipi vidhayak dal ke netaa ke pad se hataa liya gaya he or unhen vip jari karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Pawar said that there will be action on Ajit Pawar soon
 pavaar ne kaha ki bijepi loktantric prakriya main vishwaas nahin karti he
 Sharad Pawar expressed confidence that this alliance will have no problem in proving majority in the assembly
 unhone kaha ki agar jarurat padi to ve 162 se zyada vidhayakon ko apane paksh main le sakate hai
 Pawar claimed that in Maharashtra politics, this association of three parties is for 50 years, not 5 years
 'ham bataaenge ki shivasena kya cheez he'maharashtra main sarkaar bananashivsena ke liye naak kii ladaai ho chukihai
 If the government is formed under the leadership of Shiv Sena in the state, there will be a tremendous change in the profile of Uddhav Thackeray
 unhen na sirf rashtriya str par sweekaaryata milegi balki ve rashtriya raajnneeti ke centre main bhi aa jaaenge
 On Monday, Uddhav looked confident after seeing the majority of mlas
 uddhav ne bijepi par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki satta ke liye sirf jai nahin balki satyamev jayate kaa siddhant hona chahie
 Uddhav said in challenging words to the BJP that now we will tell what the Shiv Sena is
 uddhav ne bhi is gathbandhan kii lambii umr kii kaamana kii
 Ashok Chavan took over from the Congress side, former CM Ashok Chavan was handling the Morcha at the Morchahayat Hotel
 haalanki meeting main mallikarjun khadge bhi maujuud the
 Chavan claimed that at present, there are not more than 162 mlas of congress-ncp and Shiv Sena in this hotel
 ashok chavaan ne maharashtra main shivasena ke saath gathbandhan kii manjuuri ke liye congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko dhanyavad diya
 He said that Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari should call this alliance to form the government
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne 10 maah main pehali baar apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar karke apni takat sabit kii he
 In this expansion, he sidelined all the leaders who could become troublesome for him
 unhone yah bhi dikhaane kii koshish ki unke or hikeman ke bich koi rassakashi nahin he, jisaki atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim
 On 27 October, Raje administered the oath to 15 ministers
 inamen chaar cabinet mantri hai
 He promoted Arun Chaturvedi and Hem Singh Bhadana to cabinet ministers
 raaje ne 46 vibhaagon ko apane paas hi rakhaa tha or vistaar ke dabaavon ko naakaam karti ai thim kyonki kuch vidhayakon ko mantrimandal main lene se baakiyon ke naaraaz hone kaa dar tha
 The BJP has 160 mlas in the 200-member assembly and some were made ministers, leaving the rest, including their loyalists, difficult for them
 vaise is vistaar se unhen shashan chalaane main madad jarur milegi
 With this Raje has also shown that he is considered in the state BJP
 vistaar kii hari jhdi agast main hi mil gai thi, par iskaa vakt bhi unhone apni suvidha or marji se chunaa
 She succeeded in making liberal leaders of the Union and her loyalists a minister
 unki sabase badi kamyaabi yah he ki unhone party ke bheetar apane ekmaatr mukhar virdohi ghanashyam tiwadi ko mantri nahin banaaya
 Several top leaders of the Center had advised Tiwari to be included
 isse ecchhatra bahman netaa banane kii tiwadi kii koshishon ko dhakka laga he
 Under tremendous pressure from the Brahmin lobby, Raje gave Chaturvedi the status of a cabinet minister the very next day
 is tarah unhone ek hi jhtke main aresas ko khush or tiwadi kaa kad or chota kar diya
 However, this step has weakened the RSS, because Chaturvedi has been repeatedly given more importance than his stature
 pehle to unhen rajyamantri bana diya gaya, baavjood iske ki ve pehali baar vidhayak bane hai
 At that time, the RSS had advocated him saying that he had been the president
 ab 10 maah main hi unhen cabinet mantri bana dene se pehali baar chunakar aae kai vidhayak irshyaa kar rahe hai
 Raje told India Today, "many elected mlas are eligible to become ministers for the first time
" phir bhi maine unhen vistaar main shaamil nahin kiya taaki unke mantri banane se vanchit rah gaye duusare vidhayakon ko bura nahin lage
 "raje did not even make Narpat Singh Rajvi a minister
 rajvi bijepi ke kaddavar netaa divangat bhairon singh shekhavat ke damaad hai
 With this, his dream of becoming the bearer of his father-in-law's Rajput heritage has remained incomplete
 unki bajaae raaje ne raajapaal singh ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya, jo aresas se jude hone ke baavjood unke liye zyada mushkil paidaa nahin karenge
 Rajpal has given Rajpal the responsibility of important activities like urban development and housing
 unhone raav rajendra singh ko bhi mantri nahin banaaya
 Because of his intelligence and independent attitude, he could have been a hindrance in the way of making consensus in the Council of Ministers for Raje
 unhen shaamil na karke raaje ne purvaagrah-rahit or taakak vichaaron se mantriparishad ko vanchit kar diya he
 He has also given place to some other people who have either become mlas for the first time or are considered second class
 inamen aise bhi hai jinhen sangh kaa varadahast praapt he or ve jatigat tathaa kshetreey santulan saadhane main mantrimandal se baahar chhod die gaye varisht or sthapit netaaon kii bharpai karenge
 He has made Pushpendra Singh a minister from his constituency to counter the influence of veteran party leader Om Mathur
 vistaar main nae or puraane, donon chehre liye gaye hai, par unamem koi anbhavi mantri nahin he
 Of the four new cabinet ministers, Sukshardar Goyal was the minister of state for some terms in Raje's first term
 raajapaal singh shekhavat or dow
 Ram Pratap has also been a minister
 inamen pratap ko raaje virdohi mana jaataa tha
 Kiran Maheshwari will be the only woman cabinet minister
 unhen udaipur main grih mantri gulab chand kataaria ke prabhaav kaa muqabla karne ke liye mantri banaaya gaya he
 The new ministers of state included in Raje's cabinet are Pushpendra Singh, Babulal Verma, Arjunlal Garg, Amra Ram, Krishnendra Kaur Deepa, Vasudev Devanani, Rajkumar Renavan, Surendra Pal TT, Ota Ram Dewasi and Anita Bhadel
 deepa kaaphi anbhavi raajnneetik hai
 She has been reaching the assembly for a long time from different parties or electing independents
 bharatpur main unki jat-rajshahi prishthbhumi party ke liye phydemand hogi
 Devnani has not got the department as per his ability but he has a chance to prove himself in the education department
 ve kattar aresas ke aadmi hai lekin kabhi raaje-virdohi nahin rahe, jaisaa ki chaturvedi or onkaar singh lakhaavat kabhi rahe the
 Both, however, later managed to get rid of their anti-regal image
 iskaa nuksaan ajmer kshetra kii raajnneeti main lakhaavat gut ke virdohi maane jane vaale devnani ko uthaanaa padaa, jinhen kabhi unka haq nahin diya gaya
 Her rival Anita Bhadel is the Devanani's counterpart in the Council of Ministers today, on the strength of Lakhawat, despite her becoming a minister for the first time

 The Delhi government has taken an important decision to remove the decaying MCD from Kadki
 mangalvaar ko liye gaye faisle main kejariwal cabinet ne teenon nagar nigamon ko 374 karod rupee dene kaa faisla liya he
 These amounts will be given under the Municipal Reform Fund
 emsidi ko sudhaaron ke milenge paisesarkaar neemsidiko sudhaaron ke liye paise die hai
 The matter seems strange because the MCD remains in question because it has not started taking steps related to economic recovery
 lekin dilli cabinet ne ye faisla liya he ki is vittiya varsh 2015-16 main teenon nagar nigamon ko is head ke tahat paisa diya jayega
 MCD employees who went on strike last year, this change in the attitude of Delhi government is visible due to the pressure of the court
 pichley saal jab kai maheene tak vetan nahin mila tha to nagar nigam ke karmchaaree hadtaal par chale gaye the
 There was a lot of dirt in Delhi and the matter reached the Delhi High Court
 hai court main pichhali baar jab sunwaayee hui tab dilli sarkaar kii ore se unke vakil rahul mehara ne is baat ke liye hami bhar di thi ki teenon emsidi ko dilli sarkaar municipal relif fund muhaiyaa karaayegi
 There was also talk that if the scale is made only for work, then apart from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, both mcds cannot get these funds
 isliye dilli cabinet ne uttari or purvi nagar nigam ke khastahal aarthik haalat ko dekhte hue ek saal tak in donon nagar nigam ko raahat dene kaa faisla kiya
 Funds will be released from this formula, the amount fixed by the Cabinet of Delhi will be Rs 145 crore for North MCD, 110 crore for East MCD and Rs 118 crore for South MCD
 fund ke liye jo formula tay kiya gaya he usamen 50 fisadi aabaadi ke liye 25 fisadi kshetrafal or 25 fisadi jansankhya ghanatv ke hisaab se fund mila he
 However, elections are due in Delhi next year, so how much will the employees benefit from this fund and which party will be able to bake political bread on it, all this will be decided in the coming months

 madhya pradesh ke devas jile main khule main shouch kii majaburi se hone vaali sharmindagi or pareshaani ke chalate apane pati ko chhodkar maayke main rah rahi 27-varshiya dalit mahila ke saamne uske jeevanasathi ko aakhirkaar jhukna padaa
 When the woman's husband promised in front of the court that he would build a toilet in his house, she agreed to return to the in-laws' house and survived a family breakdown
 indore se kareeb 75 kilometre dur koi 1,200 logon kii aabaadi vaale gaanv mundlaana main rahane vaala devkaran malviya (30) kareeb saat saal pehle savita ke saath vivaah ke bandhan main bandhaa tha
 When Savita had a dispute with her husband about three years ago, she went to the maternal home with both her children
 usne bharan-poshan kaa kharch hasil karne ke liye devas jile ke bagali kii adaalat main june, 2012 main apane pati ke khilaaf mukadmaa bhi daayar kar diya
 When the first class judicial magistrate (JMFC) Jayant Sharma explained to the husband and wife that they had a reconciliation talks, it was revealed that the couple's dispute is nothing but the lack of a solid toilet at their home
 adaalat ne maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan 6 disambar ko kaha, yah tathy saamne aayaa he ki devkaran ke ghar pakkaa shauchalay nahin banwaaya gaya he
 In such a situation Savita has to go out for open defecation and due to this there is a dispute between the two parties (husband and wife)
 sulah vaarta ke dauraan savita ne peshkash kii ki yadi uskaa pati apane ghar pakkaa shauchalay banavaa letaa he, to vah sasuraal lautakar uske saath rahane ko taiyaar he
 The court remarked that open defecation of a woman is not justified on human grounds
 prayek manushya ko sa-sammaan dainik nityakarm karne kaa adhikaar he tathaa ek pati kaa bhi yah naitik daayitv he ki vah apni patni ko is silsile main uski garima ke anuroop suvidhaayen pradaan kare
 The judge ordered Devkaran to inform the court before constructing a pucca toilet at his residence before December 24
 baharhaal, maamla yaheen khatm nahin hua
 As Savita's lawyer Praveen Chaudhary said on Wednesday, when the case was heard again on December 24, it was found out that Devkaran had built a permanent toilet at his home on the court's order, but he kept it covered in the door instead
 is
 unhone kaha, meri pakshakaar savita ne adaalat main jor dekar kaha ki jab tak uskaa pati apane ghar bane pakke shauchalay main darwaja nahin lagavaayega, vah sasuraal nahin lautegi
 Understanding the solvency of the case, my opposition lawyer also helped to conclude the conciliation negotiations between the couple
 samjhauta vaarta aage badhane par donon pakshon ke bich aakhirkaar yah sahmati bani ki devkaran aagaamee peshi dinaank (10 janvari, 2014) tak shauchalay kaa nirmaan kaary puraa karke isamen darwaja lagavaayega or agali sunwaayee ke dauraan apni patni ko adaalat se hi apane saath le jane ko tatpar rahegaa
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday along with his cabinet colleagues understood the nuances of good governance and management at IIM Lucknow
 mukhyamantri yogi ne is maukey par kaha ki jivan seekhney ke liye hota he
 Every event in life gets to learn something or the other
 seekhney ke liye jahaan kahin bhi avasar mili uskaa laabh avashya lenaa chahie
 He said that the state government has stood the test of people's hopes and aspirations in the last two and a half years
 mukhyamantri IIM main yojit leadership deveopment ‘manthan-1' kaarykram main bol rahe the
 He said that three special sessions of the brainstorming program are being organized in collaboration with IIM, the first session of which is held today
 pradesh ke sarvangin vikaas main is tarah ke prashikshan kaarykram sahaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 He said that the state government is making positive efforts towards making the state superior
 iske drushtigat pradesh sarkaar sushasan, prabandhan, netritv kaushal va janabhagidaari ko behatar dhang se jaanane ke liye IIM santhaan se sahyog praapt kar rahi he
 For the first time a state government has decided to take training from the best management institute of the country for the efficiency of its political leadership in the country
 siem yogi ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar ‘sabakaa saath-sabakaa vikaas-sabakaa vishwaas' kii avadharana ko apanaate hue janata kii seva kar rahi he
 Sharing his experience, he said that the suggestions given by an administrative officer were implemented on primary schools, which resulted in positive results
 shashan kii yojanaon ko janata tak pahunchane main shikshan santhaan mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 On this occasion, IIM Director Archana Shukla said that this program is being completed with the inspiration of the Chief Minister of the state
 uttar pradesh bharat kii ridh he
 Only by developing Uttar Pradesh can we become a partner in the development of the country
 unhone kaha ki ek rajaneta se janata ko kaaphi ummiden hoti hai
 This brainstorming program will play an important role in meeting these expectations
 is avasar par rajya sarkaar ke mantrigan, im—lakhanu ke shikshavid bhi upasthit the
 Inflation is going to knock
 yah baat vaishvik bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main ho rahe ijaphe ke baad se kahi ja rahi he
 But now the last full budget of the Modi government at the center has also decided that inflation will be coming in the country
 kendriya bajet 2018 main sarkaar ne kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna karne ke liye agri utpaadon ke nunatam samarthan mulya main dedh guna ijapha karne kaa faisla liya he
 Economic experts claim that with this decision no one can stop knocking inflation in the country
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ne 2014 me pesh kiye bajet main mana tha ki fasal kaa samarthan mulya badhaane se desh main fasal utpaada kii keemton main ijapha ho jaataa he jiske chalate mahangaai badhanaa tay ho jaataa he
 In fact, this policy decision of higher support price will put a burden on the treasury of the central government and wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds will be available to the common man at a higher than fixed price
 is asar ke chalate aam aadmi kii rasoyee kaa bajet to bigadanaa tay he hi
 This will also increase the government's revenue deficit
 haalanki ki kendra sarkaar ke is nitigat faisle main ek pramukh baat or he ki desh main ab kheti karne main kisaanon kii laagat ko tay kiya jayega
 There is currently no framework for determining costs
 lihaaja kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna karne kii niyat se yadi nunatam samarthan mulya badhaayaa jaataa he to kisaan kii laagat ke aadhaar par badi bahes hone kii sambhaavna he
 Read this: Budget 2018: Understand the special features of the budget and its effect on you that retail inflation is already increasing in the country and rising crude oil prices are expected to increase further
 sipiai par aadhaarit khudara mahangaai disambar 2017 main 17 maheene ke sheersh par pahunch gaya tha or yah rigerv bank ke 4 fisadi ke lakshya se upar he
 In this also, food inflation has been the most important reason
 ab samarthan mulya main ijaphe ke elaan se desh main khaadya mahangaai main bada ijapha hona tay he
 The farmers' reaction to the increase in the minimum price is that the support price is not procured in the country
 lihaaja samarthan mulya badhaane ke elaan kii jagah yadi sarkaar yah elaan karti ki kisaanon ke utpaada ko nishchit taur par sarkaar dwaara kharida jayega tabhi kisaanon ko sidhaa phayda pahunch sakegaa
 Therefore, it can be said that in the full budget that came before the general elections, if the central government took this step to provide relief to the farmers, then everyone in the country will have to bear the brunt of it

 India has reassured Bangladesh that the Border Security Force (BSF) personnel would not fire on Bangladeshis infiltrating the border

 According to the government news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangastha (BSS), Krishna told Moni that "adequate steps are being taken to deal with the issue
" " pichley maheene dhaka main grih sachiv str kii baatcheet main bharat ne saat janvari kii ghatana par khed prakat kiya tha, jisamen phalani naam kii kishori kii maut ho gai thi
 She was crossing the border with her family and BSF opened fire

 This concern is more for the child growing in the womb than itself
 is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa he ki garbhavastha wo samay he jab ek mahila ko sabase zyada dekhbhaal or parhez kii jarurat hoti he
 It is true that what a woman eats and lives in pregnancy has a direct effect on the child of her
 pehle bachche ke janm ke samay to vaise bhi mahilaayein kaaphi kanphyus rahati hai
 She remains entangled in deciding what will be right and what is wrong
 haalanki pregnancy se judi kai kitaaben bazaar main maujuud hai or ghar kii bujurg mahilaayein bhi salaah dene ke liye hoti hai lekin ye baat hameshaa yaad rakhni chahie kisbaki pregnancy alag hoti he
 It may be that the symptoms of two women match, but the circumstances of both are the same, not necessarily
 agar aap chaahati hai ki aapaki pregnancy khushhaal or surakshit ho to aap in upayon ko apana sakati hai:1
 It is very important to take adequate amounts of folic acid
 hari pattiyon main paaya jane vaala folic acid bachche ke janm se judi kai pareshaaniyon se bachaane kaa kaam karata he
 2
 garbhavastha main fal khaanaa bahut jaruri he lekin koi bhi fal khaane se pehle ye sunishchit kar len ki fal acchhee tarah se dhule hue hon
 Otherwise there may be a risk of infection
 3
 Eating eggs, chicken or fish during pregnancy is very beneficial
 par inkaa acchhee tarah pakaa hona behad jaruri he
 4
 jitna zyada ho sake protein khaaen
 Protein is important in the development of the child
 aap chahen to daalen, bijen or doodh ko apni diet kaa hissaa banaakar paryaapt maatra main protein praapt kar sakati hai
 5
 ek ore jahaan aapako apane khaane-pine kaa puraa khyaal rakhane kii jarurat he vahiin ye bhi jaruri he ki aap is dauraan lagane vaala ek bhi vaxineshan bhoolen nahin
 If you are late for a few days, consult a doctor and get it done immediately
 6
 It is better to avoid eating junk food during pregnancy
 isamen ucch maatra main fat hota he, jisaki vajah se cholestrol badhane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 7
 garbhavastha ke dauraan sampurna aahaar lenaa bahut jaruri he
 The child will also develop right after getting sufficient nutrients in the body
 powerful vuman kaa ek luk uske dressing se jaahir hota he
 For example, when Michelle Obama was America's First Lady, whenever she was seen on camera
 unke dressing unki perselanity ko alag se bayaan karti najar aati
 Something similar happens from our workplace to ordinary life
 jab power dressing hamaari pahchaan bataati he
 On Wednesday, Harps Bazaar editor Nomita Kalra discussed fashion dressing with fashion designer Payal Khandwala in Business Today's program 'most Powerful Women in Indian Business'
 aaie jaane, kya he power dressing, kaise ham bhi apni rosemara kii life main power dressing ko apanaakar apana vyaktitv nikhaar sakate hai
 Payal says that in my eyes, your dressing is a mirror of your personality
 aapaki dressing aapke aapke vyaktitv ko darshaati he
 If you go to a meeting at the workplace through a well dressup, then they make a good impression there
 meraa maananaa he ki agar aap kuch aisa pahante hai jo relax hone ke saath saath aapako stylish dikhaata he to ye aapke liye sabase acha he
 Nomita Kalra argued that if you go to a corporate office by not wearing transparent clothes, in which your tattoos are peeping
 aise main use client se milane nahin bhej sakate hai
 Every office also has a décorum
 is par paayal ne kaha ki aapako ise gambhirtha se lenaa chahie
 We cannot wear revolutionary clothes everywhere
 har jagah ke kuch alikhit rule hote hai jo hamen apnaane hote hai
 Payal said that we also need to follow fashion with well dress
 unhone sari ke sawaal par kaha ki indira gandhi se sonia gandhi tak sari pahenti ai hai, phir bhi sari aaj board room main itani zyada prachlit kyon nahin he
 To this, Payal said that one should know different ways to choose and carry a sari
 power dressing main color kaa chayan bhi jaruripower dressing kii baat karen to color kaa power se kya rishta he? iske sawaal par paayal kahati hai ki bharat ke itihaas se lekar hamaari kala, craft or khaanaa tak sab tamaam rangon se pata padaa he
 It is very important for us to choose colors, but we should also choose colors very thoughtfully
 har koi har rang ko nahin apana saktaa he
 Choose the color that suits you, or in which you are comfortable

 Sonu Punjaban, who runs a racket of jismfaris in Delhi, may be in jail, but his dirty business, his relatives and knowledgeable people were running
 sonu punjaban jail ke andar se apane sex racket ke dhandhe ko chalaa rahi thi, lekin uske is dhandhe ko bhi dilli police ne band kar diya he
 Police have arrested 3 people, including two brothers of Sonu Punjaban, who were cheating people in the name of escort service

 During interrogation, he told that these people are doing business of escort services for Sonu Punjab and are committing fraud and robbery with people under the guise of this business
 in logon ne apni gang main sonu se judi ladakiyon ko bhi shaamil kar rakhaa tha
 People associated with gangs earlier used to advertise on different web portals in the name of Escort Service, which includes some well-known web portals
 jab koi customer inhen phone karata tha, tab ye use nehru place or uske aasapaas ke ilaake main bulaate the or us shaks ko ladki dikhaakar advance lete the
 When the deal was done completely, the girl would quarrel during this time and they escaped
 poochtacha ke baad pataa chalaa ki agar is dauraan koi graahak inase paise waapas maangata to ye use hathiyaar ke dam par bhaga dete the
 Due to shame, no one complained to the police
 poochtacha main ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki jail main band sonu punjaban ke kehane par ye ek gavaah ko dhamkee bhi de rahe the
 So far this gang has committed fraud and robbery with hundreds of people
 gujarat ke surat main ek 11 varshiya maasoom bacchee kii berahami se hatya kar di gai
 Police suspect that the girl was murdered after the rape
 pichley 8 dinon se police hatya ke is maamle ko sulajhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The police has announced a cash reward of 20 thousand by placing posters in the city and giving information related to this case

 Early that morning in the morning, the Pandesra police station in Surat received information that there was a lashpadi of a basket near the cricket ground
 police kaa kaafila maukey par ja pahunchaa
 Police closely investigated the corpse
 magar maukey se koi suraag nahin mila
 After this, the police sent the child's body for postmortem
 lekin 8 din biit jane par bhi police mritak bacchee kii shinaakht nahin kar pai he
 Who murdered him and why

 jis badardi se bacchee kaa katl kiya gaya he, use dekhakar yahi lagata he ki is krity ko anjaam dene vaala koi aam insaan nahin balki shaitan hi hoga
 The politics has started on the plan of All India Muslim Law Board (AIMPLB) to open Sharia courts (darul Kaja) in every district in the country
 bijepi se lekar sapa tak muslim lau board ke is faisle ke khilaaf khadey hai
 The BJP believes that Sharia courts have no place in the villages and districts of the country
 vahiin sapa kahati he ki desh main ek samvidhan he or usee kaa paalan hona chahie
 Explain that AIMPLB has plans to expand Sharia courts across the country
 is sambandh main 15 july ko dilli main hone vaali board kii baithak main sharia adaalaton ke prastaav par charchaa kii jaaegi
 In this important meeting of the board, the lawyers, judges and general public will discuss to intensify the programs that are about sharia law
 jabaki ye baithak pehle lakhanu main hone vaali thi
 Political attacks have also started on this
 bijepi pravaktaa minakshi lekhi kaa kahana he 'aap dharmik maamalon par charchaa kar sakate hai lekin is desh main nyaaypalika kaa mahatv he
 Sharia courts have no place in the villages and districts of the country
 desh kii adaalatein kanoon ke antargat kaary karti hai
 Our country is not the Islamic Republic of India '
 bijepi pravaktaa rakesh treepathi ne desh main sharia adaalaton ke vistaar kii yojana banane ke liye muslim personal lau board kii ninda kii he
 He said that AIMPLB is just an NGO
 desh main ek kanoon he, jise har kisi ko paalan karnaa chahie
 AIMPLB has an anti-women view and has only exploited Muslim women
 bijepi ke saath-saath sapa bhi muslim personal lau board ke faisle ke paksh main nahin he
 SP spokesman Juhi Singh said that there is a constitution in the country which everyone should follow
 har jile main sharia court banaae jane par AIMIM ke adhyaksh or muslim personal lau board ke sadsy asaduddin ovaisi ne twit karke kaha ki ye court ke samaanaantar nahin he
 It is called Darul Kaja and has been working since 1993
 mantriji supremecourt dwaara vishnu locham maamle main die gaye faisle ko kripaya padhie, jab aapaki sahyogi sanstha vihip is masale ko lekar court gai thi
 As a minister of the department concerned, you should keep this matter informed
 ol india muslim lau board ke sadsy jafarayab jilani ne kaha, 'ham inhen sharia adaalat nahin kehete
 These are Darul Kaja
 inamen kaaji logon ke vaivaahik matbhed or jhagade sulajhaata he or agar maamle kaa nipataara nahin ho paata to alag hone ke raste sujhata he
 When asked about the board's plan to open Sharia courts (darul-qaza) in every district, Jilani said that the aim of the darul-qaza Committee is to have Sharia courts in every district, so that Muslim people can spread their Sharia issues to other courts Resolve in darul-qaza instead of carrying
 jafarayab jilani ne yah bhi kaha ki ol india personal lau board ne is tarah kii vyavastha 1993 main shuru kii thi
 This is not a new thing
 centre sarkaar kaa isse koi lenaa dena nahin he'
 He says that it was also allowed by the Supreme Court to continue
 supreme court ne paaya tha ki yah ko samanaantar court nahin he
 The Sunni Maulana Sufiyan Nizami supported the move of the AIMPLB, saying that the expansion of Sharia courts would easily resolve the issues covered under Sharia
 jabaki board ke is kadam ko lekar shiya samudaay ke moulana saf abbaas virodh main he
 AIMPLB has claimed that there are about 40 darul-qaza in Uttar Pradesh

 videshi stock exange main bhartiya stock market se jude deryvative kii trading par roak laga di gai he
 The country's 3 major stock exchanges, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), BSE and the Metropolition Stock Exchange (MSEI), together decided to ban it

 Among them are the French journalist Nicolas Henin, who was freed from isis's fall and the liberated Theo Padnos of Al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-nusra, who narrated his horrific story and how ISIS took advantage of the Arab Spring
 yah bahes iageies ke khilaaf jang main ahm yogadan kar sakati he
 Currently, Kurdish fighters are continuing their campaign against ISIS in the border areas of Iraq and Syria with the help of Iran with the help of Iraqi troops and American jets

 The most recent case is the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1996

 Therefore, Amarullah Saleh, the former head of Afghanistan's National Security Directorate, is well-versed with savage acts like ISIS

 The Sunni Arabs, who were disenchanted with the Shia-dominated government, joined the ISIS

 Again, this group attracted a large number of youth who traced their roots

 Henin said, "if you have a grudge against society, if you want to revolt with your parents, then join ISIS

 Heckel does not fully agree with the opinion that ISIS foreign fighters will return to their country and wage war
 ve kehete hai, "yah ulti dhara kii daleel afghanistan ke anubhav par aadhaarit he
 Arab fighters went there and joined 9 jihadi groups and carried out 9 / 11

 2007 or 2012 ke donon chunaavon main jin logon ko tikat nahin mili, unhone iskaa jawaab party mukhyalay par hangaame or hinsa se diya tha
 Insiders estimate that the Congress had to pay for at least 40 seats due to the mistakes made in ticket sharing in the last elections
 rashtriya mahasachiv ashok gahalot or unke do sahaayakon—bharat singh solanki or shakti singh gohil—ke rahete is baar tikat bantwaare main zyada paardarshita kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 But the party's hands are tied
 purv congress netaa shankar singh waghela kii aguai main hue vidroh main usne apane 13 vidhayak bhaajapa ke haathon ganvaa die the
 In such a situation, he will have to give tickets to his 44 sitting mlas
 gujarat congress ke mahasachiv nishith vyas sweekaar karte hai ki ''ehtiyaat baratna hoga ki tikat se vanchit naaraaz log nakaaratmak pratikriya na karen
 "even if this is true, it is not as easy to say, as one Congress leader believes," There are 15 to 20 contenders for every seat in rural areas in this election
 "thakor, patel or mewaani ke saath pesh aana bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 Especially when all three are bargaining with the Congress leadership over ticket distribution
 inamen thakor khaas taur par aditol bataae jate hai
 Insiders claim that Patel has demanded 15-20 tickets
 jahaan mewaani sabase zyada naram or sidhe hai, vahiin yah tikdi kul milakar kam se kam 40 siten apane liye chaahati he
 The questions of Hardik and Alpesh on the papers seem appealing to Patel, Thakor and Mevani in the Congress camp, but in reality there is a conflict between the three interests
 misaal ke liye, uttar or dakshin gujarat main, or saurashtra ke kuch ahm jilon main bhi thakor or congress kaa obisi kshatriya samudaay main tagada asar he
 But in the villages, the Patels have traditionally clashed with the OBC Kshatriyas
 pehle ye do samudaay ek saath aae bhi hai, to keval tabhi jab bhaajapa ne unhen manaa liya tha ki unke hit hindu ekajutata ke jariye hi sabase achche tareeke se puure ho sakate hai
 How will the Congress handle their competing demands with each other? All OBC castes in large parts of rural Gujarat are not only against OBC Kshatriyas but also Patels
 party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki jin ilaakon main hardik kii marji se chune gaye congress ke patel ummidavaaron ko tagada samarthan hasil he, vahaan bhaajapa pehle hi matadaataaon ko jati ke aadhaar par baantne kaa mansuba bana rahi he
 Gehlot, the Gujarat in-charge of the party, whose leadership has played a very important role in the apparent rise of the Congress, insists that "bjp's attempts to polarize on caste and communal grounds will not succeed because resentment against the BJP on all issues People have been united
 " congress main kai log daawa karte hai ki satta-virdohi rujhaan is kadar majboot he ki vah jati kii daraaron ko dhak saktaa he
 Even after this, 38 Patel organizations, big and small, have come out against Hardik and termed him as a self-styled leader with political ambitions
 inkaa aarope he ki hardik patel samaaj ko gumraah kar rahe hai tab jabaki bhaajapa kii rajya sarkaar ne uski zyaadaatar maangen maan lee hai
 Like Hardik, a large number of Thakores have raised questions about Alpesh being the leader of the community
 unki gujarat thakor sena ke purv samarthakon ne shikaayat kii he ki alpesh ne kasam khai thi ki ve saamaajik kaaryakarta hai or kabhi siyasat main kadam nahin rakhenge
 The BJP is bent on fueling their sense of betrayal
 gujarat bhaajapa ke pravaktaa bharat pandya jahiraa taur par hardik or alpesh ke sandarbh main kehete hai, ''vishaal samudaayon par pakad banaae rakhana utana aasaan nahin hota jitna siyaasi panditon ko lagata he
 "the OBC Kshatriya face of BJP, Natuji Thakore, is more docile
 ve daawa karte hai, ''alpesh kii rajnatik takat ko bahut zyada badha-chadhaakar aanka ja rahaa he
 "even if the Congress' urban nightmare of the Congress resolves some of the issues listed above, how will the BJP dominate the hundred seats in urban and suburban areas? It is a matter of concern for her
 pichley chunaav main bhaajapa ne yah dabadabaa sabit kiya tha jab ahmedabad, vadodara, surat or rajkot sareekhe shaharon main takreeban har seat usne jiti thi
 Despite this, he suffered heavy losses in rural north and central Gujarat
 nagar nikaayon ke 2015 main hue chunaavon main, hardik patel ke ubharne ke baad bhi, bhaajapa ne 31 jila panchayaton main se mahaj saat or 203 taluka panchayaton main se 56 jiti thim, par saaton nagar nigam jitkar usne shahari ilaakon main apana dabadabaa banaae rakhaa tha
 She has a track record at the state and national levels
 misaal ke liye, narmada baandh ko isaki puri oonchai 138 meter tak badhaane kaa prastaav modi ke pradhanmantri banane se pehle centre main upie kii sarkaar ke maatahat ek dashak tak dhul khaataa rahaa tha
 In 2012, Gujarat Chief Minister Modi announced a project to divert some of the 5,000 villages of Saurashtra to 115 dams in addition to the Narmada water stored in the Sardar Sarovar Dam
 bataur pradhanmantri unhone is par aage kaam kiya or 2016 main saurashtra narmada avataran sinchai (sauni) yojana ke pehle charan kaa udghaatan kiya
 The BJP believes that the project will help in combating the Congress in rural Saurashtra
 modi or hindutakhir main, congress satta-virdohi bhaavana kaa chaahe jitna dhindhora pite, vah jaanati he ki modi ne apane grih rajya main takreeban mithkeey darja hasil kar liya he
 Some people call it "gujarati Gauravya", much of it lies in Modi's image as a leader
 congress ke ek netaa ne mana ki teen maheene main party ne jo badhat banaai he vah modi kii apil ke saamne taash ke patton kii tarah dharashayi ho jaaegi
 This is what we fear most
 hindutv kii prayogshaala ke taur par jane jane vaale soobe main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko hindutv card khilne main koi jhijak nahin he
 a frivolous attempt has already been made to try to link Ahmed Patel, a Rajya Sabha member of Congress and Sonia Gandhi's confidant, to ISIS, through a suspected terrorist who worked in a hospital in Bharuch (where Patel was a trustee)
 Went
 shah kaa doosraa turup kaa patta di
 Yes
 vanjaaraa hai jo gujarat police ke purv dipti inspector general or aatank-virdohi daste ke pramukh the
 He has spent eight years in jail on charges of killings in alleged fake encounters
 isane unhen kattar hinduon ke bich hero bana diya he
 The BJP believes that Vanzara's popularity can prove to be a powerful cut of the Congress's caste strategy
 jab tak modi sarvesarva hai tab tak shah kii ranneeti or booth prabandhan kii vajah se congress ke liye gujarat main apane sapane ko saakaar karnaa aasaan nahin he

 isaki aadharshila 1993 main rakhi gai thi
 The website says, the city is named after the ancient city of Modi Inn, which was the center of the Hushmanam dynasty
 is vansh ne isroyal kii samrudh viraasat ko rachaa tha
 Rabbi Akiva, who has been living in India for the last six years, says, "it is a young city which is growing very fast with a young population"
 unhone kaha ki vah bharat aane se kuch saal pehle modi in shahar gaye the
 Akiva said, the naming of the city has nothing to do with Prime Minister Modi, but it is an interesting coincidence
 akiva ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki shahar ke naam main in (yen) bharat kaa sankshep ho saktaa he
 He also said that the citizens were very happy about Prime Minister Modi's visit to Israel, which was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Israel

 Forty million people who came under the draft National Register of Citizens will not have any effect on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 desh ke mukhya chunaav ayukta omprakash ravat is bare main khaase nishcint dikhte hai
 He argues that not all people top the voter conditions
 saare 18 saal se upar kii aayu ke nahin honge
 Thousands will also have children
 jo log voter hone kii sharten puri karte hai unki pahchaan kar or naagarikta ke dastavejon se santusht hone ke baad unka naam matadaata suchi main darj karne ke nirdesh assam ke mukhya chunaav adhikari ko de diye gayi hai
 CEC Rawat said that the voter list is to be published on January 4, 2019
 hamaare paas kaaphi vakt he
 We have instructed the Chief Election Officer to keep in touch with the State Coordinator of the National Register of Citizens
 hamane assam ke siio seenarasise talmail kar hafte bhar main report maangi he
 In the report, the CEO will give all the figures of how many children are there in 4 million people
 kitne naye voter kii umr ke hai jo abhi-abhi 18 saal kii dahalij paar kar chuke hai auki kitne adhed yaa bujurg hai
 We have also called for data of women and men
 yani ek complit data hamaare paas hoga
 That means in time the picture will be clear before us
 unke mahakme ke log jaise-jaise un chalis lakh logon kii naagarikta ke daavon kii pushti karte jaaenge lage haath chunaav ayog apni taraf se veriphication kar unka naam matadaata suchi main darj karata jayega
 Rawat also said that if the NRC is unable to complete its data collection till January 4, 2019, then our team will prepare the complete data from our system
 jitne logon ne apane dastavej or arji hamaare ERO yani elactoral role officer ke daftar main jamaa kara denge to unki tasadeeq ke baad ham unako voter list main darj kar lenge
 After all, our slogan and sutra sentence is that no voter should be left out
 matadaata suchi banane main bhi or vot dene main bhi
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Rawat also said that we are not tied to NRC by law
 haa, ham unke data se apane data kaa milan karenge
 This will give us additional ease in verification
 iske baad bhi mumkin he ki kai log aise mil jaaenge jinka naam enarasi main nahin hoga
 But the voter will be in the list
 aise bhi kai log honge jo enarasi main honge lekin unke vot nahin bane honge
 Because our team will not be satisfied with their claims
 yaa phir wo voter banaaye jane kii teen ahm sharton ko puraa nahin karte hon
 These three conditions are that he should be a citizen of the country
 uski umr 18 saal se zyada ho
 He should not be a convicted, insane or bankrupt
 ahmedabad kii sadakon par sena kii gaadiyaan gujarat ke liye raahat se pehle kisi apshakun kii aahat kii tarah hai
 For the first time since 2002, these pictures of the army, which returned to the streets of Ahmedabad, are telling that between 25 August and 26 August evening, the Gujarat Police has lost so much that now the matter is not going to handle it
 dilli ne bhi sena or ardhsainik bal bhejne main zaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 The rallies have been going on in Gujarat since a month, but why did the situation go out of control only when lakhs came in the rally on 25th
 ek aise samay main jab puure desh main bijepi kaa rajnatik niyantran dikh rahaa he, gujarat to uske niyantran kii behatar prayogshaala he, vahaan kyon sab kuch niyantran se baahar jaataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 If you want to know who is behind Hardik Patel, then if there was a concrete answer to this question, it would have been found by now
 hardik patel kehete hai ki unke peeche koi nahin he
 Behind them is the poverty of the villages and unemployment of the Patels
 atakalon se jawaab milanaa hota to mil chukaa hota
 Therefore, instead of who is behind Hardik, at the moment, it is necessary to see why Gujarat is in front of us because of Hardik, what is that
 mumbai se surat pahunche hamaare sahyogi prasad kathe ne jab jali hui bason ko ginana shuru kiya to ek hi jagah par 14 basen jali huin mili
 Cranes and milk tankers were burnt under this bridge
 prasad kathe jab shoot kar rahe the tab bhi kuch vaahanon se dhuaan nikal hi rahaa tha
 At night, people had come to take selfies with these burnt buses
 surat ke kapodara, sarasanaa thana kshetron main karfu laga rahaa, police or pradarshnakariyon ke bich bhaaga bhaagi chalati rahi
 In the same Surat, a few days ago, lakhs of people came to the rally of Patel youth, then there was no violence
 surat main patelon kii aabaadi das lakh bataai jaati he
 Boys came out on the streets in Patel-dominated areas here
 bason or sarkari imaaraton ko nishaanaa banane lage
 The Joint Commissioner and two soldiers were also injured
 surat ke skool buudhvaar ko bhi band rahe, guuruuvaar ko bhi band rahenge
 Our associates in Ahmedabad, Rajeev Pathak and Abhishek Sharma started taking the city round
 donon jab ranip ilaake kii gujarat steel tub crossing ke paas pahunche to vahaan dekha ki patelon kii bheed railgadee ko roak patari ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 It was difficult for our colleagues to record close by so they reached the roof of a nearby building
 jaldi hi police ne apni karrwai shuru kar di or takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 At that time, the police got an eye on our colleagues, then started shelling towards them too
 iske baad donon pahunche bapunagar ilaake kii maatruchhaaya sosayadi main
 This woman started crying on seeing the camera
 bataane lagi ki police ne hamen patel samaj kar khub maaraa he
 All 25 vehicles parked in the parking lot have been broken
 hamaare gharon main bhi ghus kar nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Bapunagar is a Patel-dominated area
 aap jaanate hi hai ki yahaan ki socytiyon main zyaadaatar patel hi rahete hai
 a few other castes live, but they belong only to the upper caste
 rajeev or abhishek ko kuch jagahon par logon ne bataaya ki patelon kii sosayadi ko police ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 On the evening of the 25th, when Patel returned from the GMDC grounds, the police started chasing away seven hundred and eight hundred boys on fast
 police ne anshan par baithe ladakon ko to peeta hi, aam logon ko bhi nahin choda
 The media team was also charged with lathi
 police kii karrwai kaa faisla sarkaar yaa raajnneetik str par liya gaya yah koi nahin jaanata par jawaab itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The violence did not erupt even when the Gujarat Chief Minister refused to go to the GMDC ground and take a memorandum from the Patidars and stated clearly that it was not possible to give reservation to the Patels due to the Supreme Court's 50 per cent cap
 police kii karrwai hote hi aadhe ghante ke bheetar ahmedabad ke patel bahul ilaakon main hinsa bhadak gai
 Curfew was imposed in Ramol, Nicole, Bapunagar, Naranpura, Odhav, Krishna Nagar, Ghatlodia
 patelon or police ke bich takaraav hone laga
 BJP leader Govardhan Zadaphia also said that the police have taken many people from Bapu Nagar without any fault
 hardik patel ne buudhvaar ko gujarat band kaa elaan kiya to sarkaar ne internet or whatsap band kar diye
 Our political parties know how effective the spread of rumor is through whatsapp
 kulamilaakar buudhvaar ko gujarat shant to rahaa lekin banaaskantha main police kii firing main do naujavaanon kii maut ho gai
 Meanwhile, five youth injured in the police action in Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening have died
 pradhanmantri modi ne turant shanti kii apil kii or kaha ki hinsa se koi rasta nahin nikalataa he
 The Prime Minister said that we will have to find solutions by working together and negotiating
 gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne phir se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii lekin unke nivas ke aas paas suraksha badha di gai
 An attempt was also made to burn the home of the state Home Minister on the 25th night
 hardik patel ne bhi shanti kii apil kii he
 Hardik has also accused the police
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne koi bayaan nahin diya he
 In the meantime, many types of questions have arisen in the minds of people, to which we will try to find the answer
 kai logon ke man main sawaal he ki patelon kii yah ladaai aarakshan ke liye nahin he balki aarakshan ko hi khatm karne ke liye he
 The peddlers have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally
 samvidhan sabha se lekar aaj tak aarakshan ke khilaaf di jane vaali merit or barabari kii daleelein nahin badali hai
 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation
 sirf itnaa kehane se ki ve nae tareeke se sochna chaahate hai unka raajnneetik vajood khatare main pad saktaa he
 So both these parties in their manifesto for fifteen to twenty years talk about reservation for upper castes on economic basis but they become silent as soon as they come in the government
 yahaan tak ki gujarat ke masale par baat karne ke liye gujarat or bijepi ne apane pravaktaa tak nahin bheje
 It states that Congress and BJP do not always do politics by reading the comments of Facebook and Twitter
 soshal media ke aarakshan virodhiyon ko bhale lagata ho ki ve in do dalon ko chalaate hai
 On the other hand, the Dalit and OBC society is becoming cautious with these voices
 gujarat kaa dalit to abhi chup he magar obisi ne awaz uthaani shuru kar di he
 The problem is that along with the Patels, the Kshatriya Rajputs, Brahmins and Raghuvanshis are also demanding to join the obcs
 gujarat main jagah-jagah par ho rahi inaki reliyon se bhi obisi samudaay zyada ashankit hua he
 The comments - ravivaar ko vadodara ke 60 gaanvon se aae kshatriyon ne bhi aarakshan kii maang ko lekar teen sitambar ke din raily karne kaa faisla kiya he
 - Around 5000 Kshatriya Rajputs took out a rally in Godhra and have also submitted a memorandum to the Collector
 - kshatriya rajputon kii is raily main panchmahal, mahisagar or dahod se log jamaa hue the
 - Brahmin Samaj and Raghuvanshi Samaj also took out a rally in Amreli, Saurashtra to demand for reservation
 - is raily main 30,000 ke kareeb log shaamil hue or colector ko gyaapan diya gaya
 In response to these rallies, Thakor Samaj also rallied in Ahmedabad on 23 August
 - thakor samaaj bhi patelon kii tarah aarthik or raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee mana jaataa he
 Is it not that reservation has become a popular and effective model, if there is or was a development model in Gujarat, then there should be the most opportunities for merit and equality
 vahaan ke noujvaan aarakshan ke liye kyon majaboor hue
 Well, the Patel community hoisted the flag of their economic success in Gujarat and abroad and got political power in return
 ab vahi samaaj aarakshan kii baat kar rahaa he
 If the person who is considered the richest asks for reservation, then the question should be about reservation or the reality of that richness
 dilli ne bhi sena or ardhsainik bal bhejne main zaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 The rallies have been going on in Gujarat since a month, but why did the situation go out of control only when lakhs came in the rally on 25th
 ek aise samay main jab puure desh main bijepi kaa rajnatik niyantran dikh rahaa he, gujarat to uske niyantran kii behatar prayogshaala he, vahaan kyon sab kuch niyantran se baahar jaataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 If you want to know who is behind Hardik Patel, then if there was a concrete answer to this question, it would have been found by now
 hardik patel kehete hai ki unke peeche koi nahin he
 Behind them is the poverty of the villages and unemployment of the Patels
 atakalon se jawaab milanaa hota to mil chukaa hota
 Therefore, instead of who is behind Hardik, at the moment, it is necessary to see why Gujarat is in front of us because of Hardik, what is that
 mumbai se surat pahunche hamaare sahyogi prasad kathe ne jab jali hui bason ko ginana shuru kiya to ek hi jagah par 14 basen jali huin mili
 Cranes and milk tankers were burnt under this bridge
 prasad kathe jab shoot kar rahe the tab bhi kuch vaahanon se dhuaan nikal hi rahaa tha
 At night, people had come to take selfies with these burnt buses
 surat ke kapodara, sarasanaa thana kshetron main karfu laga rahaa, police or pradarshnakariyon ke bich bhaaga bhaagi chalati rahi
 In the same Surat, a few days ago, lakhs of people came to the rally of Patel youth, then there was no violence
 surat main patelon kii aabaadi das lakh bataai jaati he
 Boys came out on the streets in Patel-dominated areas here
 bason or sarkari imaaraton ko nishaanaa banane lage
 The Joint Commissioner and two soldiers were also injured

 Our associates in Ahmedabad, Rajeev Pathak and Abhishek Sharma started taking the city round

 It was difficult for our colleagues to record close by so they reached the roof of a nearby building
 jaldi hi police ne apni karrwai shuru kar di or takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 At that time, the police got an eye on our colleagues, then started shelling towards them too
 iske baad donon pahunche bapunagar ilaake kii maatruchhaaya sosayadi main
 This woman started crying on seeing the camera
 bataane lagi ki police ne hamen patel samaj kar khub maaraa he
 All 25 vehicles parked in the parking lot have been broken
 hamaare gharon main bhi ghus kar nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Bapunagar is a Patel-dominated area
 aap jaanate hi hai ki yahaan ki socytiyon main zyaadaatar patel hi rahete hai
 a few other castes live, but they belong only to the upper caste
 rajeev or abhishek ko kuch jagahon par logon ne bataaya ki patelon kii sosayadi ko police ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 On the evening of the 25th, when Patel returned from the GMDC grounds, the police started chasing away seven hundred and eight hundred boys on fast
 police ne anshan par baithe ladakon ko to peeta hi, aam logon ko bhi nahin choda
 The media team was also charged with lathi
 police kii karrwai kaa faisla sarkaar yaa raajnneetik str par liya gaya yah koi nahin jaanata par jawaab itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The violence did not erupt even when the Gujarat Chief Minister refused to go to the GMDC ground and take a memorandum from the Patidars and stated clearly that it was not possible to give reservation to the Patels due to the Supreme Court's 50 per cent cap
 police kii karrwai hote hi aadhe ghante ke bheetar ahmedabad ke patel bahul ilaakon main hinsa bhadak gai
 Curfew was imposed in Ramol, Nicole, Bapunagar, Naranpura, Odhav, Krishna Nagar, Ghatlodia
 patelon or police ke bich takaraav hone laga
 BJP leader Govardhan Zadaphia also said that the police have taken many people from Bapu Nagar without any fault
 hardik patel ne buudhvaar ko gujarat band kaa elaan kiya to sarkaar ne internet or whatsap band kar diye
 Our political parties know how effective the spread of rumor is through whatsapp

 Meanwhile, five youth injured in the police action in Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening have died
 pradhanmantri modi ne turant shanti kii apil kii or kaha ki hinsa se koi rasta nahin nikalataa he
 The Prime Minister said that we will have to find solutions by working together and negotiating
 gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne phir se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii lekin unke nivas ke aas paas suraksha badha di gai
 An attempt was also made to burn the home of the state Home Minister on the 25th night
 hardik patel ne bhi shanti kii apil kii he
 Hardik has also accused the police
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne koi bayaan nahin diya he
 In the meantime, many types of questions have arisen in the minds of people, to which we will try to find the answer
 kai logon ke man main sawaal he ki patelon kii yah ladaai aarakshan ke liye nahin he balki aarakshan ko hi khatm karne ke liye he
 The peddlers have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally
 samvidhan sabha se lekar aaj tak aarakshan ke khilaaf di jane vaali merit or barabari kii daleelein nahin badali hai
 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation

 agar aap yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki hardik patel ke peeche koun he to is sawaal kaa agar thos jawaab hota to ab tak to mil hi gaya hota
 Hardik Patel says that no one is behind him
 unke peeche gaanvon kii garibi or patelon kii berojgaare he
 Had it been answered by speculation, we would have got it
 isliye hardik ke peeche koun he kii jagah philhal yah dekhne kii zarurat he ki hardik ke kaaran jo gujarat hamaare saamne he wo kyon hai, wo kya he
 When our colleague Prasad Kathe, who arrived in Surat from Mumbai, started counting the burnt buses, 14 buses were burnt at the same place
 is pul ke neeche kraine or doodh ke tanker ko phoonk diya gaya
 Even when Prasad Kathe was shooting, smoke was coming out of some vehicles

 ahmedabad main hamaare sahyogi rajeev pathak or abhishek sharma ne shahar kaa round lenaa shuru kiya
 When both of them reached near the Gujarat Steel Tube Crossing in Ranip area, they saw a crowd of Patels trying to damage the rail tracks
 hamaare sahyogiyon ke liye paas se record karnaa mushkil tha isliye ve nazadik kii imaarat kii chat par ja pahunche
 Soon the police started their action and a situation of confrontation arose
 tabhi police kii nigaah hamaare sahyogiyon par bhi padi to unki taraf bhi shelling shuru kar di
 After this, both of them reached the Matchachaya Society of Bapunagar area
 yah mahila camera dekhte hi rone lageen
 Started telling that the police have killed us a lot as Patel

 Our houses have also been harmed by entering
 bapunagar patel bahul ilaaka he
 You are aware that most of the societies here live in Patel
 chand duusari jati ke log rahete hai magar ve sirf agadi jati ke hote hai
 At some places, Rajiv and Abhishek were told by the police that the Patel society has been targeted by the police
 25 taarikh kii shaam jab jiemdisi maidan se patel naujavaanon kaa hujum laut chukaa tha tab vahaan anshan par baithe saat aath sau ladakon ko bhagane ke liye police ne khadedna shuru kar diya
 The police not only beaten the boys who were on hunger strike, but also left the common people
 media team par bhi lathi charge kiya gaya
 No one knows the decision taken by the police or the political level, but the answer is not so difficult
 hinsa to tab bhi nahin bhadki jab gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne jiemdisi ground jaakar patidaaron kaa gyaapan lene se manaa kar diya or saaf-saaf kaha ki supreme court kii 50 fisadi kii seemaa ke kaaran patelon ko aarakshan dena mumkin nahin he
 Within half an hour of the police action, violence erupted in Patel-dominated areas of Ahmedabad
 ramol, nichol, bapunagar, naranpura, odhav, krishna nagar, ghatlodia main karfu laga diya gaya
 There was a confrontation between the Patels and the police
 bijepi netaa govardhan jadaafia ne bhi kaha ki police bina kisi kasoor ke kai logon ko baapu nagar se uthaa le gai he
 When Hardik Patel announced the Gujarat bandh on Wednesday, the government shut down the Internet and whatsapp
 hamaare raajnneetik dalon ko pataa he ki whatsap ke zariye afvaah failaane kaa kaam kitna asardaar hota he
 Overall, Gujarat remained calm on Wednesday, but two youth died in police firing in Banaskantha
 udhar ahmedabad main mangalvaar shaam hui police karrwai main ghayal paanch naujavaanon kii maut ho gai he
 Prime Minister Modi immediately appealed for peace and said that there is no way out of the violence
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hamen milakar or baatcheet se samaadhaan khojna hi hoga
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat again appealed to maintain peace but security around his residence was increased
 rajya ke grahamantri kaa ghar bhi 25 taarikh kii raat jalaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Hardik Patel has also appealed for peace
 hardik ne police par bhi aarope lagaae hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has not made any statement
 is bich logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal uthne lage hai jiskaa jawaab ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge
 There is a question in the minds of many people that this battle of the Patels is not for reservation but for abolition of reservation itself
 padidaron ne aise bayaan bhi diye hai ki obisi main jagah nahin to aarakshan kii vyavastha hi nahin
 Seeing the crowd of boys at the GMDC ground, youth outside Gujarat started writing against the reservation
 aarakshan virdohi savarna yuvaaon ko laga ki patelon kii raily ke bahaane phir se mauka aayaa he aarakshan ke khilaaf baat karne kaa
 From the Constituent Assembly till date, the arguments of merit and equality against reservation have not changed
 samasya yah he ki aarakshan virdohi noujvaan jin raajnneetik dalon se ummid karte hai, jin netaaon kaa loha maanate hai unamem saahas hi nahin he ki ve aarakshan ke sawaal par nae tareeke se sochane kaa prastaav tak kar saken
 Just by saying that they want to think in a new way, their political existence may be in danger
 lihaaza ye donon dal pandrah bees saalon se apane ghoshnaptr main savarnon ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat to karte hai magar sarkaar main aate hi chup ho jate hai
 Even Gujarat and BJP did not send their spokespersons to discuss the issue of Gujarat
 yah bataata he ki congress or bijepi hameshaa fasebuk or twitor ke coment padhakar raajnneeti nahin karti hai
 Social media reservation opponents may feel that they run these two parties
 duusari taraf in awaazon se dalit or obisi samaaj satark hone laga he
 Gujarat's Dalit is still silent but OBC has started raising voice
 samasya yah he ki patelon ke saath saath kshatriya rajput, brahman or raghuvanshi bhi obisi main shaamil hone ke maang kar rahe hai
 The OBC community has become more apprehensive about their rallies taking place in Gujarat
 tippaniyan On Sunday, Kshatriyas from 60 villages of Vadodara have also decided to hold a rally on September 3 to demand reservation
 - kareeb 5000 kii sankhya main kshatriya rajputon ne godhra main ek raily nikaali or colector ko gyaapan bhi diya he

 - in reliyon ke jawaab main 23 agast ko ahmedabad main thakor samaaj ne bhi raily kar di
 - Thakor society is also considered economically and politically powerful like Patels
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation

 Meanwhile, five youth injured in the police action in Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening have died

 The peddlers have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally

 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation

 On the other hand, the Dalit and OBC society is becoming cautious with these voices
 gujarat kaa dalit to abhi chup he magar obisi ne awaz uthaani shuru kar di he
 The problem is that along with the Patels, the Kshatriya Rajputs, Brahmins and Raghuvanshis are also demanding to join the obcs
 gujarat main jagah-jagah par ho rahi inaki reliyon se bhi obisi samudaay zyada ashankit hua he
 The comments - ravivaar ko vadodara ke 60 gaanvon se aae kshatriyon ne bhi aarakshan kii maang ko lekar teen sitambar ke din raily karne kaa faisla kiya he
 - Around 5000 Kshatriya Rajputs took out a rally in Godhra and have also submitted a memorandum to the Collector
 - kshatriya rajputon kii is raily main panchmahal, mahisagar or dahod se log jamaa hue the
 - Brahmin Samaj and Raghuvanshi Samaj also took out a rally in Amreli, Saurashtra to demand for reservation
 - is raily main 30,000 ke kareeb log shaamil hue or colector ko gyaapan diya gaya
 In response to these rallies, Thakor Samaj also rallied in Ahmedabad on 23 August
 - thakor samaaj bhi patelon kii tarah aarthik or raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee mana jaataa he
 Is it not that reservation has become a popular and effective model, if there is or was a development model in Gujarat, then there should be the most opportunities for merit and equality
 vahaan ke noujvaan aarakshan ke liye kyon majaboor hue
 Well, the Patel community hoisted the flag of their economic success in Gujarat and abroad and got political power in return
 ab vahi samaaj aarakshan kii baat kar rahaa he
 If the person who is considered the richest asks for reservation, then the question should be about reservation or the reality of that richness
 rajeev or abhishek ko kuch jagahon par logon ne bataaya ki patelon kii sosayadi ko police ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 On the evening of the 25th, when Patel returned from the GMDC grounds, the police started chasing away seven hundred and eight hundred boys on fast
 police ne anshan par baithe ladakon ko to peeta hi, aam logon ko bhi nahin choda
 The media team was also charged with lathi
 police kii karrwai kaa faisla sarkaar yaa raajnneetik str par liya gaya yah koi nahin jaanata par jawaab itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The violence did not erupt even when the Gujarat Chief Minister refused to go to the GMDC ground and take a memorandum from the Patidars and stated clearly that it was not possible to give reservation to the Patels due to the Supreme Court's 50 per cent cap
 police kii karrwai hote hi aadhe ghante ke bheetar ahmedabad ke patel bahul ilaakon main hinsa bhadak gai
 Curfew was imposed in Ramol, Nicole, Bapunagar, Naranpura, Odhav, Krishna Nagar, Ghatlodia
 patelon or police ke bich takaraav hone laga
 BJP leader Govardhan Zadaphia also said that the police have taken many people from Bapu Nagar without any fault
 hardik patel ne buudhvaar ko gujarat band kaa elaan kiya to sarkaar ne internet or whatsap band kar diye
 Our political parties know how effective the spread of rumor is through whatsapp
 kulamilaakar buudhvaar ko gujarat shant to rahaa lekin banaaskantha main police kii firing main do naujavaanon kii maut ho gai
 Meanwhile, five youth injured in the police action in Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening have died
 pradhanmantri modi ne turant shanti kii apil kii or kaha ki hinsa se koi rasta nahin nikalataa he
 The Prime Minister said that we will have to find solutions by working together and negotiating
 gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne phir se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii lekin unke nivas ke aas paas suraksha badha di gai
 An attempt was also made to burn the home of the state Home Minister on the 25th night
 hardik patel ne bhi shanti kii apil kii he
 Hardik has also accused the police
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne koi bayaan nahin diya he
 In the meantime, many types of questions have arisen in the minds of people, to which we will try to find the answer
 kai logon ke man main sawaal he ki patelon kii yah ladaai aarakshan ke liye nahin he balki aarakshan ko hi khatm karne ke liye he
 The peddlers have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally
 samvidhan sabha se lekar aaj tak aarakshan ke khilaaf di jane vaali merit or barabari kii daleelein nahin badali hai
 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation

 is bich logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal uthne lage hai jiskaa jawaab ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge
 There is a question in the minds of many people that this battle of the Patels is not for reservation but for abolition of reservation itself
 padidaron ne aise bayaan bhi diye hai ki obisi main jagah nahin to aarakshan kii vyavastha hi nahin
 Seeing the crowd of boys at the GMDC ground, youth outside Gujarat started writing against the reservation
 aarakshan virdohi savarna yuvaaon ko laga ki patelon kii raily ke bahaane phir se mauka aayaa he aarakshan ke khilaaf baat karne kaa
 From the Constituent Assembly till date, the arguments of merit and equality against reservation have not changed
 samasya yah he ki aarakshan virdohi noujvaan jin raajnneetik dalon se ummid karte hai, jin netaaon kaa loha maanate hai unamem saahas hi nahin he ki ve aarakshan ke sawaal par nae tareeke se sochane kaa prastaav tak kar saken

 Social media reservation opponents may feel that they run these two parties
 duusari taraf in awaazon se dalit or obisi samaaj satark hone laga he
 Gujarat's Dalit is still silent but OBC has started raising voice
 samasya yah he ki patelon ke saath saath kshatriya rajput, brahman or raghuvanshi bhi obisi main shaamil hone ke maang kar rahe hai
 The OBC community has become more apprehensive about their rallies taking place in Gujarat
 tippaniyan On Sunday, Kshatriyas from 60 villages of Vadodara have also decided to hold a rally on September 3 to demand reservation
 - kareeb 5000 kii sankhya main kshatriya rajputon ne godhra main ek raily nikaali or colector ko gyaapan bhi diya he

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation

 Go to in and see all 27 points of the university series and then show your child that we want to see you ruined in this college, but now let's watch TV

 On 26 February, we showed the condition of some banks' toilets in the prime time series
 asar ye hua he ki elahabaad bank, state bank of india, sindicket bank or indian bank harakat main aayaa he
 All of them have sent circulars and announced to make 100 percent toilets for women in every branch
 aapke screen par jo panktiyaan chal rahi hai unheen circular kii hai
 There was a lot of meeting regarding toilet arrangements in Indian Bank branch in Pant Bhawan, Patna
 elahabaad bank ne to 9 janvari ke apane circular kaa bhi zikr kar diya magar yah nahin bataaya ki ek maheene ke bich in circulron ke dauraan hua kya
 Allahabad Bank's circular says that there should be a good toilet and drinking water for both men and women
 state bank of india ke messej main kaha gaya he ki NDTV is surveying the toilet facilities of women employees, but has been lightly warned not to damage the image, that is, the bankers should not tell me anything
 ab bahut der ho chuki he
 a lot of information has reached me
 hamane kai massej aise bhi dekhe hai jinamein riginal head se upar ke adhikari shakhaon ke manager se abhadra bhashaa main baat karte hai
 He should stop doing this early or else he will show those abuses on TV
 bank apane vigyaapan par kitna karch karte hai
 For three-three years, they kept the banner of cleanliness, then why did they not make different toilets for women or men in every branch
 vaise ab jab ban jayega to bainkon ko prime time ke darshak se udghaatan karana chahie, kyonki yahi wo darshak hai jo shridevi kii dukhad maut par channelon kii nautanki chhodkar ek zero tiarapy ankar kii bainkon par series dekh rahe the
 Half congratulations to all of you viewers
 puri badhai tab jab shauchalay ban jaaenge
 If you count Nirav Modi, this is the 9th issue of the bank series, however, according to the predicament within the bank, it should be the sixth digit
 is shauchalay ko dekhakar aap dil na chota karen bas pet par niyantran karne kii ichhashakti badi kar len
 It belongs to a toilet of a bank in Punjab
 bhejne vaale se vaada he ki naam na bataaun to nibhaa rahaa hum
 There is no latch in the door so someone stands outside
 mahila karmchaaree philhal nahin hai magar jab jaanch ke liye yaa cash ke saath aati hai to isi shauchalay kaa istamaal karnaa padataa he
 Someone stands outside
 camod ke bagal main kursi kyon rakhi he is par aap bhi kuch dimag lagaaiye
 There must be something falling, which the chair must have been placed to prevent
 sochie ki jab yah kursi yahaan aa gai he to jahaan ye thi vahaan kya rakhaa hoga
 Probably this chair is kept in the toilet, only then the cot is kept here
 khatiya par baithkar kaam hota he
 In this way the food heating machine is kept
 aapkaa banker in halaat main kaam kar rahaa he
 Look at this second picture
 kabhi yahaan toilet hua karata tha, jagah nahin he to filein rakh di gai hai
 Customers, reporters and the aggrieved party have sent feedback from a large number of bank branches
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye yah feedback sone kaa anda he
 If you want, you can get accolades in two days
 aisa ho jaae to mujhe bhi july tak yah series nahin kerani padegi
 In this way i will keep doing it continuously but not in the middle
 bainkon ke jo bade afasar hai chaalaak hote hai
 When the condition of the toilet was shown, he became aware
 jab maine kaha ki diwali tak yah series karuunga to kai bainkon ne apane branch kii khabar leni shuru kar di he
 This is the toilet for a rural bank in Himachal Pradesh
 isaki tasviir dekhakar aapako pataa chal jayega ki bank apane karmchaariyon kaa kis tarah khyaal rakhte hai
 This video is from Shyam Nagar branch of Punjab National Bank, Kanpur
 yahaan ek hi shauchalay he jo bank ke baahar he
 He is also in this condition
 yahaan ek mahila karmchaaree bhi kaam karti hai
 There is only one toilet for both men and women
 kaaran or bahaane main meri dilchaspee nahin he, meri dilchaspee jo he use dikhaane main he
 Central government women get 180 days maternity leave
 saath main maanen do saal tak child care live le sakati hai
 Can be taken together or in pieces until it is 18 years old
 us do saal kii chuttee le sakati hai
 But in the same central government-controlled government banks, women get maternity leave of only 6 months
 itnaa antar kyon he
 Can not the chairman, one day, equal the maternity leave of women bankers to women working in the government
 yah antar abhi tak kaise he
 In our NDTV, we men get 15 days paternity leave
 purush adhikariyon kaa bhi haal bura he
 Regional head type, who are the top two percent of the officers, have a lot of fun, but the managers below have to stay in the bank till nine o'clock in the night
 aakhir banking jaisaa kaam koi subah ke das baje se lekar raat ke das baje tak kaise karata he
