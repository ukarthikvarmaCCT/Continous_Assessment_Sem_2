 The new fledgling Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh has started the biggest action against stray cows and cattle on the lines of the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh
 isaki shuruyaat rajdhani bhopal se payalat project ke taur par ho gai he
 Madhya Pradesh Animal Husbandry Minister Lakhan Singh Yadav has instructed to send stray cows roaming the streets and send them to Gaushala and Kanji House
 mantri kaa nirdesh milte hi sarkari amala bhi sakriy ho gaya or bhopal colector or kamishnar ne nagar nigam ko sadakon par se aawaara pashuon ko pakadana shuru kar diya
 Animal Husbandry Minister of the state Lakhon Singh Yadav said that the BJP is responsible for the plight of the cows in which improvements are being made
 unhone kaha ki yah madhya pradesh nahin puure desh kaa vishay he
 The plight of cows across the country occurred during the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bhartiya janata party gaay ko mata maanati he, lekin kabhi is par gaur nahin kiya
 We had decided in the meeting that from the 16th, all the stray cattle would catch livestock

 Let us tell you that the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh has recently decided to send stray animals from the streets to the cow protection center and to send cows to jail if there is no place and hence BJP is accusing Congress of copying Yogi government
 is
 bhopal ke mahayor alok sharma ne kaha ki jahaan-jahaan bijepi ke mukhyamantri hai vahaan acha kaam ho rahaa he or yogi sarkaar ke kaamon kaa anusaran agar kamalnath kii sarkaar kar rahi he to unhen lagata he ki yah acha he

 chhattisgarh ke raipur main krishi vibhaag main karyrat bi
 De Guha has surprisingly devised the technique of identifying blood groups from coconuts
 guha kisi bhi vyakti ko bina chhue mahaj 10 second main blad group bataa dete hai
 Usually, coconut is used only to destroy the temples, but if someone says that it can tell your blood group, then suddenly i do not believe it
 guha kaa daawa he ki vah isse bharaa or khaali silendar, jameen ke andar kaa pani, bhumigat surangon kii bhi pahchaan kar sakate hai
 He is now doing research to find out the scientific reason why the coconut turns in different direction in different blood groups
 chikitsa vigyaan ke anusaar 8 blad group e positive, e negative, abi positive, abi negative, bi positive, bi negative, o positive or o negative hote hai
 Guha says that he can identify 5 blood groups a positive, AB positive, b positive, o positive and o negative from coconut
 baaki teen ko lekar bhi shodh ho rahaa he
 Since the number of people with these three blood groups is very small, it is taking time to identify them
 aakhir alag-alag blad group main nariyal alag disha main kyon mud jaataa he, iskaa vaigyanik kaaran guha khud nahin jaanate
 Guha is now researching to find out
 is kaam main unki madad kar rahi hai unki beti sonaali, monali or betaa aayush
 His three children doing engineering in computer science are expected to find out the scientific reasons related to it soon
 patni minakshi bhi ab is kala main visheshgy ho chuki hai
 Guha says that take coconut in palm slightly above the head of any person
 thodi der main nariyal alag disha main mud jaataa he, jis jagah bhumigat pani, yaa jal aapurti kii pipeline ho, vahaan nariyal sahi nattejey nahin bataata
 Coconut takes a 45 degree position when it is a positive blood group
 abi positive main 45 se 55 degree, bi positive main 60 degree, o positive main 90 or o negative main 180 degree kii pojishan le letaa he
 Guha said that in the year 2005, i was called to a school in Balodabazar to find a good source of water
 vahaan ke bachche bahut sharaarat kar rahe the, unhen shant karaane ke liye maine unase kaha ki tum sab ek line main khadey ho jaao, main jaanchungaa ki tumme pani he yaa nahin
 Jokingly, during this test, i noticed that the coconut placed on the palm, slightly above the head of some children, stood in 90 degrees
 maine yahi prayog ghar aakar apane bacchon par kiya
 Then, the same thing happened
 lab main bacchon kaa blad group check karaayaa to wo o positive niklaa
 This is where my journey started
 baharhaal rajdhani kaa yah guha parivaar shodh ke baad kuch or nai jaankariyaan saamne laane main juta hua he
 a new twist has come in the case of the attack on Rakhi Birla, Minister of Women and Child Development of Delhi Government
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki raakhi kii car ke shishe par pathar nahin balki bachche kii gend lagi thi
 Significantly, the car of Kirakhi Birla was attacked with stone by an unknown person on Sunday evening
 raakhi wagon aar car kii aage vaali seat par baithi thim
 Rakhi was completely safe in this attack, but the mirror of her car was chopped off
 car par us vakt hamalaa hua jab raakhi mongolpuri main ek mandir main ho rahe ek samaaroh se laut rahi thim
 During interrogation, some people have claimed that there was no ball on the glass of the car but a child playing cricket nearby
 sutron ke mutabik ghatana ke turant baad bachche or uske pita ne sabake bich raakhi se maafee bhi maang lee thi
 But in spite of this, Minister Sahiba reached the police station and filed a complaint at the Mongol Puri police station, hiding the incident of the child
 iske alaava raakhi ke pita par bhi bachche ke parivaar ko apshabd kehane ke aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 The 26-year-old firebrand leader of the Aam Aadmi Party is now facing allegations that he made a minor incident into a mess
 raakhi mongolpuri ilaake kii vidhayak hai
 He defeated Raj Kumar Chavan, the incumbent minister of the previous Congress government in the Mangolpuri seat in the Delhi Assembly elections
 raakhi birla patrakarita main eme hai or vah dalit samudaay se aati hai
 His mother is a scavenger in a government school
 raakhi pehle anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan se judin, baad main vah arvind kejariwal ke sangyojan main bani party se jud gayi
 Rakhi's refusal to take security Soon after the incident, when reporters asked Rakhi if she would take security, she said that she would not take any police protection
 raakhi ne kaha, 'main koi suraksha nahin luungi
 This is a decision based on our principle
 main dari-sahami nahin hum
 i will continue to work for the welfare of the people
 'unhone kaha, 'hamaari party kii netaa santosh coli ne samaaj ke liye apni jaan de di
 We are committed to serving the people
 mujhe santosh coli se prerana milti he or aisi ghatnaon se darungi nahin
 Three other party workers were also with Rakhi at the time of the incident
 aam aadmi party (AAP) ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki raakhi kii car bheed-bhaad vaale ilaake main thi, tabhi kuch logon ne car par koi cheez phenki
 This damaged the glass of the vehicle
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki raakhi jab mongolpuri ilaake ke ek mandir se laut rahi thim, to aar block main un par yah hamalaa hua
 Significantly, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Rakhi Birla, has been out on the streets for the last few days, taking stock of the arrangements for the night shelters
 unhone kai maukon par laaparvaah adhikariyon va karmchaariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat bhi kahi he

 a notice was sought from the Commission by the Notice Broadcasting Ministry seeking an answer, asking why the channel was launched just before the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ayog ko jawaab dete hue soochna mantralay ne kaha he ki NAMO TV ko news channel nahin balki ek vigyaapan par he, jise apane-apane str par jari kiya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, his permission is not required for this, the entire party's expenses are being borne by the party concerned
 pehle cap par jataai thi aapatti‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ campan par isse pehle bhi chunaav ayog kii sakhti saamne aa chuki thi
 The Election Commission had earlier objected to the tea distributed in the rail in cups printed with the advertisement of 'main Bhi Chowkidar'

 The security of the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya has been beefed up following the arrest of Tousif Gaya, accused in the 2008 serial bomb blasts in Ahmedabad
 tawsiff kii giraftaar ke baad usase hui poochtacha main khufia agenciyon ko is baat kii jaankaree mili he
 According to the agencies, Tausif had not only come to spread terror network in Gaya but was also plotting to carry out terror attack

Citing the crime figures of Uttar Pradesh and alleged irregularities in the implementation of MGNREGA, the Congress targeted the Chief Minister Mayawati fiercely and accused her of creating an atmosphere of crime and corruption in the state
 party pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh kii chitthee par mayawati kii pratikriya ko bhi khaarij kiya or kaha ki isamen shor zyada he, tathy nahin hai
 It is worth noting that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati has written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, expressing strong objection to the allegations of Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh about the alleged irregularities in the implementation of MNREGA in the state as politically motivated
 kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne haal hi main mayawati ko bheje patr main rajya main manaregaa ke kriyanvayan main kathith khaamiyon or aniyamittaaon kii ore ishaara kiya tha

 The social worker suggested to the school management that Matilda be placed in the foster home

 If the team wins, then Sehra and losers lose their teeth

 But today we are in a mood of praise
 idhar australia gira, udhar bharat test siries main 2-0 se aage ho gaya he or hyderabad test jeetamhendra singh dhoniban gaye hai awwal captain
 This was India's 22nd win under his captaincy and Vesaurav Ganguly has become the highest Test winning Indian captain, breaking the 21 Test winning record
 dhoni ke paas or bhi bahut kuch he
 Under his captaincy, India has won the World Cup, T20 World Cup, India has been number 1 in Tests and one-dayers
 lekin kya sirf aankadon kii nazar se hi dhoni bharat ke best captain hai?yahi sawaal hamane apni website par aapse poocha
 Apart from Dhoni, we gave you the names of more successful captains: Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammad Azharuddin, Kapil Dev
 sabase chaunkaane vaale ank aapane tendulkar ko die, mahaz 2
 6 percent vote! True, he is a great batsman but his captaincy could not bring the team car on track
 1983 world cap jeetne valekapil devko 9
 11 to Azhar, who won on home pitches in the 9s and 90s
 6 pratishat vot mili
 Now the fight is between Mahi and Dada
 dada ne hi apni captaini main maahi ko pehali baar mauka diya tha yani us heere ko taraashne vaale johari vahi hai
 In fact, Ganguly made many more champion players, not just Dhoni
 ek taraf tendulkar, dravid, lakshmana, kumble, shrinath jaise seniors or duusari taraf yuvaraj, harbhajan, sahvaag, zahir jaise yuva players jo aage chalakar champions bane
 Ganguly was willing to die for his players and the players for their captain
 sirf ghar par hi nahin, ganguli ne team ko videsh main jaakar bhi ladanaa sikhaaya
 Perhaps the best for him was that his team had many great batsmen together
 dada ko aapane die 36
 2 percent vote
 or maahi ko 39
 8
 yani dhoni number van!dhoni kaa temprament ganguli se alag he
 Ganguly wanted to do everything by himself, keeping everything in his hands
 dhoni kaa sochna he ki captain apane players ko sirf raste dikhaa saktaa he, or raste ko tay un players ko khud hi karnaa he
 As long as the team is winning, both are true but both had one weakness
 donon bahut ziddee the or shaayad isiilie wo apane khud ke tareekon ko zarurat ke vaqt badal nahin pate the
 But Dhoni's real and biggest test is yet to be done
 jis tarah dada ne match-phixing ke saae main team india banaai, dhoni ko ab ek yang team india khadi kerani he
 The 2015 World Cup is in Australia and it will not be easy to remain world champion there
 upar se ye na bhoolen kii agle do saal bharat videshi zamin par kam se kam 14 test match khelegaa
 If there is credibility left, then we will not make any poll: Then Dhoni's claim to the best captain will not challenge far and wide

 aam bajet pesh kiye jane ke teen din baad desh ke vittiya hisaab-kitaab main lagbhag do lakh karod rupee ke 'suraakh' ko lekar sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 Rathin Roy, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, first drew attention to the mess
 unhone 'bijnes standard' main likhaa, aarthik surveykshan tathaa aam bajet kaa adhyayan karne ke dauraan unhone paaya ki varsh 2018-19 ke liye rajasav anumaan, duusare shabdon main sarkaar kii aay, aarthik surveykshan main bajet kii tulana main puraa ek fisadi kam he
 It is also 1 per cent
 7 lakh karod rupee banataa he
 The budget uses Revised Estimate (RE), a revised estimate that states how much the government expects to earn, while the data used in the Economic Survey provides for provisional actuaries (PA), ie provisional It is called real, which is updated and more real data of government accounts
 bajet main istemaal kiya gaya rivizd estimet bataata he ki 2018-19 ke dauraan 17
 Revenue of Rs 3 lakh crore came, while updated provisional figures in the Economic Survey showed that the government's income was far lower, 15
 6 lakh karod rupee, yani 1
 7 lakh crores less
 pratishat ke lihaaz se (GDP ke pratishat ke rup main kul rajasav) bajet main rivizd estimet 9
 2 percent was reported, while the updated data given in the Economic Survey gave it one percent less, ie 8
 2 pratishat bataata he
 This inconsistency is also reflected in the government's expenditure
 bajet main vyay ko 2018-19 ke dauraan 24
 6 lakh crores has been reported, while the more accurate data of the Economic Survey shows that the government has only 23
 1 lakh karod rupee kharch kiye, yani 1
 5 lakh crores less
 is kami kii vajah - kar rajasav main kami
 On the one hand, according to the budget, the government 14 from various taxes last year
 8 lakh karod rupee kii aay kii ummid thi, lekin aarthik surveykshan ke apadated aankadon ke mutabik, sarkaar ko is mad main sirf 13
 2 lakh crore rupees achieved

 The figures shown in the budget are much higher
 
 
 ab samasya yah paidaa hoti he ki agar aapako vittiya ghaataa lakshya hasil karnaa hoga, to bajet main kahin na kahin baari katautee kerani hogi

 endie apana ummidavaar naa khadaa kar paane se chintit he to mamata banerjee alag-thalag padane se
 But Mamta's attitude has not softened
 trinmul party ne sakht lahaze main somvaar ko kah diya ki wo kisi bhi vakt sarkaar ko chhod sakate hai
 Only one gesture from Mamta Banerjee remains
 'aakhir, congress se itani khafa kyon he trinmul? raashtrapati ummidavaar ko lekar congress or tiemasi ke bich talkhi kaa pataa to sabko tha lekin talkhi tut ke kareeb pahunch chuki he iskaa khulaasa somvaar shaam ko hua
 Of course, Trinamool Congress leader Sandeep Bandopadhyay refused the resignation of the mps, but the threat is clearly hidden in his talk
 lakh take kaa sawaal ye he ki aakhir aisi naubat ai kaise? tiemasi congress par itnaa kyon bhadki hui he?iskaa khulaasa tiemasi ke rajyasabha saansad kunal ghosh ne ajtak par kiya
 Ghosh alleges that the Congress has always insulted Mamata Banerjee
 ajtak ne jab kunal ghosh ko or kureda to jhagade kii jad baahar aa gai
 Mamta ji spoke to Sonia, Mamataji went to her house
 unase acchhee baat hui
 After the conversation, she came out and talked to the media
 mamata ne hamid or pranab ke naam kaa ullekh kiya
 The next day, the Congress leaders were attacking Violet
 lekin mamata ne jo kuch kaha wo uski jaankaree sonia or ahamed patel ko thi
 That is, tmc's displeasure is that Mamata Banerjee was targeted by the Congress leaders without any reason
 lekin, ek or baat he rishton main khatas ke peeche
 Trinamool MP Kunal Ghosh said, 'there is one more thing
 ye tiemasi ke liye bahut garv kii baat he ki pranab congress ke varisht netaa hai
 Respect them
 unke paas time nahin he tiemasi se baat karne kaa
 But it's time to talk to Buddhadev and Viman Bose
 sipiem ke logon se baat karne kaa time he lekin jo hamaare alliance main he uske saath baat karne kaa samay or ichha nahin he
 Apparently, Mamata Banerjee has faced these things so much that the matter has come close to crossing the UPA
 lekin, bada sawaal ye he ki raashtrapati kii ummidavaari par siyaasi taur par alag-thalag pad chukin mamata ke liye kya upie se alag hone kaa makul vakt he? In Chhattisgarh, the OBC movement has thrown out the BJP

 The OBC class is demanding 27 percent reservation in government jobs in the state instead of 14

 Earlier, the government has been facing criticism from the cut in reservation issued to the SC class
 rajya sarkaar ne 6 maheene pehle essi ko jari 16 fisadi aarakshan main katautee kar 12 fisadi kar diya tha
 At the same time, the reservation for the tribals was increased by 28 percent to 32 percent

 Now the OBC class has plagued the government

 In this forest prepared by Bhaiya Ram, only the laws made by him follow the law
 vrikshon ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale logo ko dandit kiya jaataa he
 Dozens of trees, including Amla, Peepal, dozens of species of trees including Amla, Tamarind, Teak, Bamboo and Peepal are planted in this forest of Bhaiyaram
 bhaiya ram kaa sapana he ki vah jab tak jinda rahe pedo kii seva karata rahe or inaki sankhya bhi badhaata rahe
 Priyanka Gandhi also praised the 'tree man', Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra praised the passion of tree man Bhaiya Ram, father of thousand trees
 priyanka ne kaha, 'chitrakoot main sukhi, oobad-khabad jameen par 40,000 vrikshon kaa jangal khadaa karne vaale ‘vriksh purush’ bhaiyaram yadav ne ye sabit kar diya ki jivan main kuch bhi asambhav nahin he

 The DFO of the forest department says that this work is commendable

 He said, 'our leaders know what happened and who is behind it
 vah upie sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhane par jald vichaar karenge
 Azam Khan emphasized that his position in the airport detention cannot be compared to the positions of Kalam, Shah Rukh, Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian envoy to the United Nations and Meera Shankar, former ambassador in Washington
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ek sajeesh kaa nateeja tha kyonki main bharat kaa ek gaiyr congressi taqatvar muslim netaa hum or unhone (khurshid) bhartiya cabinet mantri ke apane rutabe kaa istemaal karke badi chaalaaki se aantarik suraksha vibhaag kii madad se yojana banaai
 Azam Khan said, "stopping me at Boston Logan International Airport cannot be compared to the affairs of former President APJ Abdul Kalam and actor Shah Rukh Khan as i have been targeted by Khurshid and his troupe who have me on Indian soil Do not dare to challenge
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab hawaii adde ke andar mujhe roka gaya, to bhartiya mahavanijya doot ke protocol adhikari vahaan bilkul mookadarshak bane hue the

 It has been 10 months since the murder of Akhlaq in the name of Gomata in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh
 yah hatyakand lambey samay tak media main chaaya rahaa
 There was a lot of politics on the assassination, but there was something more deadly than politics
 or vah cheez thi desh main goraksha ke naam par saream gundgardee kaa bad janaa
 On youtube, such videos started coming up in which armed goons publicly beat some people brutally in the name of cow slaughter or Gotkari
 inamen se kai video main yah bhi dikhaa ki gundgardee police kii maujuudagi main chal rahi he
 In the initial cases, Muslims were becoming victims of vandalism, but soon the incidents of beating of Dalits also started appearing
 is tarah ke video rajasthan, himachal pradesh, haryana, punjab, jammu or uttar pradesh se aa chuke hai
 On July 11, in Una in Gir Somnath district of Gujarat, just before the video of a Dalit marauding a cow slaying a black man with his SUV and beating him severely with a baton, came a video from Haryana in which some people named Gotskari The cow dung was fed by beating
 puri duniya main bharat kii chhavi ek madhyayugin desh kii tarah pesh karne vaali in ghatnaon main se kisi ghatana par centre sarkaar kuch nahin boli
 But a week after the Una incident, the anger of the Dalits took an organized form and many cities were hit by violence, the central government with the state believed that there was something wrong
 gujarat main dalit andolan 18 july kii raat se tej hua or isi din dilli main sansad kaa satr shuru hua
 Seeing the heat of the case, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Ben Patel met the victim's family
 maamle main 16 log giraftaar bhi kar liye gaye
 But the anger of the Dalits of Gujarat got out of control due to the delay of a week in taking action by the government
 motaa samadhia gaanv main ghatana kii jaanch karne gaye gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke ek dal ke pramukh kowshik parmaar ke mutabik, daliton kii marpet subah saadhe nau baje shuru hui or dopaher dedh baje tak chalati rahi
 During this time, the family of the victims called the police several times but there was no hearing in the police
 daliton ke bade hue gusse kii ek vajah police kaa yah ravaiya bhi rahaa
 The party says that in Gujarat, a caste of Dalits traditionally performs the work of skinning dead animals
 yahi log ab swayambhu gorakshakon kaa aasaan shikaar ban gaye hai
 That is why a special thing is seen in the Dalit movement in Gujarat that Dalits also protested by throwing the cow skeleton outside the government offices
 gujarat main jab yah virodh chal hi rahaa tha, duryog se tabhi 20 july ko uttar pradesh bijepi ke upaadhyaksh dayashankar singh ne bahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri mayawati ko bhaddi gaali de di
 Mayawati cracked down on the BJP government in the Rajya Sabha
 sadan main arun jetali ne bayaan ke liye turant maafee maangi
 Within an hour, Dayashankar was first removed from his post and then removed from the party
 lekin unki jubaan apana kaam kar chuki thi
 This attack on Mayawati did not take long to join the Dalit self-respect
 or agle din lakhanu main bispi ne mayawati ke apmaan ke khilaaf jabardast pradarshan kiya
 Meanwhile, Mayawati said, "I have been the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh four times
 log mujhe devi kii tarah puujate hai
 Mayawati said in the Rajya Sabha that Muslims were first targeted in the name of cow and now Dalits are being targeted
 jab lakhanu ke hajrganj ilaake main nile jhandon ke saath bijepi ke khilaaf naare lag rahe the, thik usee samay congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi una main peedit baaluu sirvaiya ke parivaar kaa haal-chaal le rahe the
 People of the same family were beaten on 11 July in the name of Sarebazar cow slaughter
 rahul rajkot ke aspataal bhi gaye jahaan, virodh pradarshan ke liye aatmahatya kii koshish karne vaale dalit bhartee hai
 In Gujarat, 11 people have attempted suicide against the atrocities
 rahul ne kaha, ''kuch din pehle jo video puure hindustan ne dekha, wo maine bhi dekha
 Today i met a family of children who were killed by 40 people together
 '' isi samay rashtravaadi congress party ke netaa prafull patel bhi daliton se mil rahe the
 Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is trying to gain a foothold in Gujarat, has also decided to go to Gujarat to meet the Dalit family
 yani maamla ab siyaasi ho chalaa he
 Anyway, in five-six months there are assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi ko acchhee tarah yaad he ki bihar chunaav se pehle aresas ke mukhiya mohan bhagwat ne aarakshan par vivaadit bayaan diya tha or uske baad bijepi bihar ko sambhaal hi nahin pai
 Abuses given to Mayawati may not become as big a political problem for the BJP in UP
 isiilie grih mantri rajnath singh ne sansad ko bataaya ki is ghatana se pradhanmantri narendra modi bahut dukhi hai
 But Prime Minister Modi, who tweeted Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani three months before his birthday, neither reacted to the Gujarat incident nor to the hooliganism spread in the country in the name of cow protection
 yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab modi ke raaj main dalit utpeeda ke khilaaf andolan shuru hua ho
 Earlier in the winter session of Parliament, the government had to face a similar agitation
 us samay hyderabad uniwarsity ke dalit chaatr rohit vemula kii aatmahatya ke maamle main desh bhar kii uniwarsitiyon main dalit andolan tej ho gaya tha
 Even at that time, the government had tried to quell the issue with debate and governmental power rather than hearing the problems of Dalits
 tatkaaleen maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ke bayanon ne vishvavidhyalay ke maahaul ko or garmane main khaasaa yogadan diya
 Mayawati and Irani's heated debate in Parliament was then in the news
 sarkaar kii is ranneeti kaa nateeja yah hua ki na chaahate hue bhi sara vipaksh congress ke netritv main sarkaar ke khilaaf lamaband ho gaya tha
 The situation reached such a point that when Prime Minister Modi went to attend a function of Ambedkar University in Lucknow, the students shouted 'modi Go Back' slogans and showed black flags
 is baar kaa dalit andolan uniwarsitiyon ke raste na aakar, sidhe sadak se aa rahaa he
 The BJP has definitely taken a better initiative by running Dayashankar Singh quickly
 lekin pichley saal bhar se gaay ke naam par hindutv se jude sanghathan jis tarah chutta chhod die gaye the, usase sarkaar kii chhavi ko paryaapt nuksaan pahunch chukaa he
 Once again, the entire opposition on the Dalit issue seems to be rallying with the Congress
 aise main modi sarkaar ko sochna hoga ki ujjain ke sinhasth main dalit snaan or madhya pradesh main daliton ko pujari banane jaisi skiimon par virodh kii yah nai aandhi pani na pher de

 is ek saal ke dauraan rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki vah jald se jald uttar pradesh ko desh kaa growth ingine banane kaa kaam karegi
 For this, the Yogi government in the first year started work towards strengthening law and order in the state, ensuring 24-hour power supply and improving the business environment
 isi kaa nateeja dikhaa ki desh or duniya ke bade-bade udyogpati uttar pradesh main bada nivesh karne ko raji hue
 The Yogi government successfully organized the first investor summit in the state before completing its one-year tenure where more than 1 thousand business agreements were signed within just 48 hours

 Significantly, in this effort of the state government, important agreements were signed with Tata, Reliance, Birla and Adani, among the largest companies in the country

 Birla Group's Rs 25,000 crore investment plan Kumar Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the state's largest investor company Aditya Birla Group, has promised to invest Rs 25,000 crore in the state in the next few years
 birla ne daawa kiya ki uttar pradesh desh main nijee kshetra ke nivesh kaa bada kendra banakar ubhar rahaa he or yah isi baat se saaf he ki ej of duing bijness index main upi saatven number par pahunch gaya he
 Hence, given the strong economic situation in the state, Kumar Mangalam Birla made a significant promise to expand ultratech Cement, focus the telecom sector business in UP and expand its operations in the financial sector as well in the field of Social Security

 Be it road or cinema, market or office, some eyes follow you all the time
 tab tak, jab tak ki aap ojhal nahin ho jate
 The twisted eyes of the girls never give up
 kya aap jaanate hai ki koi insaan kisi ladki ko ghurne par jindagi kaa kitna vakt qurbaan kar detaa he? ek research main vipareet sex ko ghurne se sambandhit sabhi tarah ke tathyon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 On average 43 minutes a day scientists stare at these questions to find out how much time a person spends in staring, tearing eyes at a girl
 ek british research ke har ek nattejey chaunkaane vaale hai
 According to the research conducted by the British organization Kodak Lanes Vision based on the opinion of 3000 people between the ages of 18 and 50 in 2009, a man spends a full year of his life staring at girls
 din bhar main ek insaan ausatan ek 2 nahin balki alag-alag 10 ladakiyon ko ghur letaa he
 Men spend not an entire two to four minutes every day, but on average, 43 minutes of girls or women staring blankly or tearing their eyes
 chaahakar bhi chhod nahin pate adamgar aap ab tak ye samajhate rahe hai ki ladakiyon to ghoorna purushon kii koi vikruti he yaa maansik rup se vikrut log hi ladakiyon ko chowk-chauraahey, bazaar, park yaa daftar main ankhe fadkar ghoorte hai, to aapako soch badalane kii jarurat hai
 British research proves that every human has the tendency to stare at the opposite sex
 insaan chaahakar bhi ghurne kii aadat chhod nahin paata
 Girls are not even back in the stare if you have been thinking that girls do not do the work that boys do, then it is wrong
 ladkiyaan isamen bhi ladakon ke kadam se kadam mila rahi hai
 Like boys, girls also like to stare at the opposite sex
 ladkiyaan bhi ladakon ko ghurne main, ankhon se aankh milaane main, najaron se ojhal hone tak ankhon main aankh daalkar rakhane main peeche nahin hai
 While alone, girls undoubtedly play less games of staring at boys secretly or eyeballing them, but in the presence of our peers, girls play the game of eyeballs as much as boys
 ladkiyaan detii hai jivan ke 6 mahresearch kii report ke anusaar ladakiyon kii vipareet sex ko ghurne kii aadat par bhi ankhe kholane vaale nattejey saamne aae hai
 Although girls or women have less tendency to stare than boys or men, but they also spend a lot of time on life
 18 se 50 umr kii mahilaon kii raay ko aadhaar banaakar kiye gaye research ke mutabik ladkiyaan yaa mahilaayein bhi ausatan jindagi ke puure 6 maheene vipareet sex ko ghurne par kharch kar detii hai
 The average period of staring of girls per day is 20 minutes
 har din ausatan 6 ladke nigahon memresearch main ye bhi pataa chalaa he ladkiyaan yaa mahilaayein ausatan 6 ladakon yaa purushon ko ausatan har din ghur leti hai
 The question is what do girls see in boys
 ladke agar ladakiyon ko ghoorte hai to kyon ghoorte hai is par bhi research se chaukaaney vaali jaankariyaan mili hai
 Both games are very much liked by the eyes, but the center of attraction is different for both
 ladakiyon ke sharir main aakarshanpurushon ko ladakiyon kaa sharir hi aakarshith karata he
 The shape and shape of the body, the eyes of the boys remain on the girl for that long
 lekin ladakiyon ke liye aakarshan kaa centre ladakon kaa sharir nahin, balki kuch or hai
 The girls draw the eyes of the boys and once they get the eyes, then the girls just drown in it
 ladkiyaan khud ladakon ko ghoorna to pasand karti hai
 But girls don't like boys staring at them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main ladakon kii ghurti nigahon se ladkiyaan yaa to saham jaati hai yaa sharmindagi mahasoos karti hai
 Girls are nervous when they are stared, if the eyesight is about to penetrate the body, then the girls get frightened too badly
 lekin ladakon ke saath aisa nahin he
 Not only do boys have more habit of staring, but the choice of boys than girls is also vomiting
 ladkiyaan jab ladakon ko ghurti hai yaa unpar mud-mundakar nazren gadaati hai, to ladakon ko khub bhaataa he
 The truth is that when the girls stare at them, the boys feel sorry for themselves and start moving around with friends
 saaf he thodi masti ke liye yaa man bahalane ke liye, kabhi doston main rob dikhaane ke liye yaa kabhi bas vipareet sex ko samajhane ke makasad se mud-mudakar dekhnaa aisi fitrat he, jo insaan ke liye chaahakar bhi chhodana mumkin nahin
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday issued a manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections, mentioning the construction of the Ram temple
 is baar bhi bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main ram mandir nirmaan kaa mudda shaamil kiya he or mandir nirmaan ko lekar sankalp jaahir kiya he
 At the same time, the poet and Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas has taken strong exception to the inclusion of the agenda of building the Ram temple in the BJP manifesto

Say Jai Siyaram, '' Lord Ram and we like him: Congratulations to his followers that his temple has got a place in the agenda for the 32nd consecutive year! Say Jai Siyarambata, the party has been raising the issue of construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya in every election
 2014 main bhi mandir nirmaan kaa vaada kiya tha, haalanki sarkaar ke str par koi khaas kadam nahin uthaaya gaya or maamle ke supreme court main lambit hone kaa hawala diya gaya
 At present, the Supreme Court has ordered the settlement of the Ayodhya land dispute through mediation, but the BJP has today again made it clear that temple construction is on its agenda

 BJP in its manifesto ((BJP Manifesto) 2019) has promised pension to small and marginal farmers
 60 varsh se upar ke kisaanon ko pension milegaa
 The party's promise is believed to be a master stroke
 chote or seemaant kisaanon ke alaava bijepi ne chote vyapaariyon ko bhi pension dene kaa vaada kiya he
 This announcement of the party is being seen as a major step
 party ne alag se jal shakti mantralay bhi banane kaa vaada kiya he
 Apart from this, BJP has promised that farmers will not have to pay any interest for the next five years on loans up to one lakh on Kisan Credit Card

 The article by senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has created a fresh debate on the current state of the Indian economy
 rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or vittamantri arun jetali par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa or desh kii aarthik haalat ko lekar pradhanmantri or vittamantri se istipha maanga he
 The writings of Yashwant Sinha have pushed the BJP on the backfoot and the party leadership has refrained from commenting directly on Yashwant's allegations
 sinha ke baad ab swadeshi jaagran manch ne sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon par sawaal uthaae hai

 Small businesses have been affected due to GST

 The government needs to generate employment, otherwise it will remain a political slogan
 jarurat is baat kii he ki deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke vichaaron par amal kiya jaae
 In contrast to Yashwant, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh's opinion, Brijesh Upadhyay, general secretary of the Indian Labor Union, says that Yashwant Sinha is a political figure
 main desh kii arthvyavastha ke bare main alag-alag arthshaastriyon ke alag-alag vichaar padhata rahata hum
 i believe that economists are not unanimous, the issues that Yashwant Sinha has mentioned be demonetisation or GST
 isamen majdoor kshetra kaa hone ke naate hamaara alag prakaar kaa anubhav aa rahaa he
 It is too early to make a conclusive opinion on these subjects from now on

 The general secretary of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh says that i cannot see anywhere that the economic situation has deteriorated

 Economy is stronger than before: Goelin defended the government among all, Union Minister Piyush Goyal and said that the world is seeing that India's economy has grown rapidly in the last three years under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya itihaas main sambhawatah pehali baar bharat vaishvik vikaas ko drive kar rahaa he
 Goyal said that this government has made major reforms on the issue of economy, no one thought that it could be possible to implement reforms like GST in such a big country
 bharat duniya ke sabase bade deshon main he jisane jiesti lagu kiya he
 Everyone has the freedom to express their views, but the truth is that India's economy is now stronger than before

 As Payal Nath did while divorcing Omar Abdullah
 alag hone kii afvaahon ke bich ek or janaa-mana raajnneetik kapal, hameshaa ke liye alag ho gaya
 Politicians' wives are not meant to go on social media, nor for tantrums of tweets and fanfare of news interviews
 lekin sunanda chup rahane vaali mahila nahin thim
 She was loud, active and could also dance and sing on public occasions
 vah dubai se ai thim isliye ek kism se bahari bhi thim
 Dubai, a city with many makeovers and dubious changes, which the wives of the leaders of Delhi did not like
 sunanda ko logon ke liye khaanaa bananaa pasand tha, manoranjan pasand tha or ajanabiyon se apane antarang raaj sajhakarne kii aadat thi
 In a city where politicians still drink whiskey in glasses covered with white napkins and during this time their wives are left to discuss diamonds, Sunanda was an exception
 vah'politicali inakract' thim or apane vichaar rakhane main hichakati nahin thim, bhale hi vah artical 370 kaa mudda hoya langik bhedbhaav kaa

 Overall she was a political time bomb
 sunanda ke maamle se aap yah bhi samaj sakate hai ki raajnneeti kitni 'sexist' he
 Until a woman becomes a leader on her own, she is considered an object
 sirf bharat kii baat nahin he
 This is the unwritten rule of worldwide politics
 purush galati karata he tab bhi log duusari taraf hi dekhte hai
 Whether she was Huma Abedin, who stood by her husband Anthony Weiner, who shared pornographic links, or her boss Hillary Clinton
 mahilaon ko har baat daant peesna or aansu pikar muskuraana hota he

 Petroleum Secretary Saurabh Chandra said, 'any confidential files or documents will be given in hand or sent in sealed envelopes
 ’ iske alaava, anya maanakon kaa kadai se paalan kiye jane kaa faisla kiya gaya he

 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and other top members of this terrorist organization are hiding in Kunar region, possibly in Afghanistan
 malik ne pakistan ke bheetar america drone hamalon ko nirarthak qaraar diya he kyonki unke desh main koi bhi bada aatankwaadi maujuud nahin he
 Malik told 'the Sunday Times', "if Osama had been in Pakistan, we would have known about it because we have sent thousands of soldiers to tribal areas in recent months
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘agar vah or sheersh ke chaar yaa paanch log hamaare kshetra main hote to jis tarah se ham talaashi kar rahe hai, unhen pakad liya jaataa
 Malik said that US missile attacks in Pakistan against terrorists are meaningless
 pakistani adhikariyon ke paas maujuud soochna ke anusaar osama afghanistan main sambhavat: kunar main he kyonki pakistan ke khilaaf adhiktar gatividhiyaan kunar se hi nirdeshit hoti hai
 Pakistani officials say that the US has carried out more than 40 drone strikes within the territory of their country in the last 10 months in which hundreds of people have died
 missile hamale ulta pad rahe hansiie adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki pakistan ke bheetar america ke drone hamale al kaayda kii gatividhiyaan chalaane kii kshamta nasht karne main behad prabhavi hai
 Nonetheless, Malik insists they are wasting time as al Qaeda is headed to eastern Afghanistan on the other side of the border
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ve, aalaa aatankwaadiyon ko nahin, balki madhyam darje ke logon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 "malik said," American missile strikes are going upside down because they are killing civilians and local people are turning against our government
 ham logon ke dil jeetne kii koshish karte hai or ek drone hamalaa koshishon ko dur le jaataa he
 Last week, 50 people died in a single attack

 The Pakistani army has still not captured the Swat Taliban leaders, although the home minister claims that the main leader Maulana Fazlullah has been targeted twice and has been seriously injured
 malik ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe bharosa he ki ham unhen pakad lenge
 He said that Fazlullah's family was hiding in a refugee camp and has been taken into custody
 malik ne kaha, ‘‘hamane na sirf taliban ke adhiktar logon ko maar giraaya, balki unke chhipe hone ke thikaanon tathaa hathiyaaron ke jakhiron ko bhi nasht kar diya he

 lekin kuch natural tareekon se aap apane komal or mulaayam baalo ko bachaa sakate hai
 1
 sabase pehle dhyaan rakhane vaali baat yah he ki holi khilne jane se pehle munh or haath pair par kriim lagane ke alaava apane sar par ungaliyon se achche se champi kar len
 Keep in mind that you do not have to take a break in your hair, otherwise the color may stick in the hair
 2
 After playing Holi, wash the hair with clean water for a long time, so that the color stuck to the inside is washed away
 kyunki aapke bal pehle hi kade or hanikaarak rangon kaa saamana kar chuke hai, to unhen kisi strang shampoo se na dhoen
 Use a mild herbal shampoo instead
 3
 To maintain the ph balance of the hair, wash the hair one last time by mixing lemon juice in a mug of water
 4
 Mix 2 spoons ground fenugreek in a bowl of curd and apply it in your hair and after about 15 minutes wash it with a mild shampoo
 yah mishran saare chemicals ko nikaal detaa he
 5
 agar aapke bal grey yaa safed ho chuke hai, to holi ke rang un par achche se chadh sakate hai
 And in such a situation, the color does not come out of red-green dyed hair for a month
 to holi khilne se pehle apane bal daai karnaa na bhoolen
 6 Finally, when all the color has come off after washing the hair, then champi again with a good herbal oil so that your hair can be rejuvenated again

 His role in this film was not very big
 is vakt actress prashanth singh kii 'jabariyaa jodi' par focus kar rahi hai
 The film's release schedule has been kept in July
 punjab sarkaar kii karj maafee yojana main naam na aane se niraash kisaan ne khet main fande se latak kar apni jaan de di
 The deceased Gurudev Singh was the grandson of Freedom Fighter Udham Singh of Faridkot and is being told a loan of around Rs 20 lakh
 punjab main kisaan or kisaani donon kii pareshaani thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Of course, the government has also released the installment of loan waiver, but in spite of this, the incidents of farmer suicides are not taking the name of stopping
 is baar phir se captain sahab kii karj maafee skim main naam na aane se pareshaan ek kisaan ne maut kii raah ko chunaa or gurdev singh apane parivaar ko rota bilakhta chhod is duniya ko alavida kah gaye
 Gurdev Singh, a farmer of village Chahal in Faridkot, is no longer in this world

 Gurdev Singh embraced death with a noose in his own field
 mritak kisaan gurdev ke rishtedaar jora singh ne bataaya ki gurdev singh apana naam sarkaar kii karj maafee skim main naam na aane se pareshaan the or uske sir par kareeb 20 lakh rupee kaa karj tha

 In UP, meetings and meetings continue in the midst of a rift in the ruling Yadav family
 sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne kalah shant karne kii kaman khud sambhaal lee he
 This arrogance took serious shape when CM Akhilesh Yadav also refused to accept Netaji's advice and an angry Shivpal Singh Yadav resigned from all posts in the party and the government
 ab party, parivaar or sarkaar main tut kii ashanka ko rokane ke liye akhilesh ke saamne kuch vikalp bache hai
 
 
 1
 akhileshnetaji ke aadesh ke mutabik barkhaast mantriyon gayatri prajapati or raaj kishor singh ko cabinet main behaal kar sakate hai
 The CM had discharged Netaji without his advice
 2
 Akhilesh Shivpal Singh Yadav can allay his displeasure by returning important departments like PWD and irrigation
 siem ne pradesh sapa adhyaksh ke pad se hataae jane ke baad chachaa shivpal se ye ahm vibhaag chin liye the
 3
 akhilesh agar in vikalpon ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hote hai to unke paas siem kii kursi chhodane kaa vikalp he
 However, Akhilesh has said that there is no quarrel in the family and he is ready to accept everything Netaji
 akhilesh ne yah bhi kaha he ki wo sabhi pad or vibhaag chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai
 4
 agar siem kii kursi chhod dete hai to akhilesh ke paas sapa pradesh adhyaksh banane kaa vikalp he
 He has also indicated that he should be reassigned the responsibility of the SP State President
 unhone kaha ki unhen tikat baantne kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 Mulayam snatched the post of SP state president from Akhilesh and gave it to Shivpal
 5
 Akhilesh should not express differences over the orders of the Koparti chief
 chunaav main ab chah maheene bache hai
 In such a situation, there is no option but to listen to Netaji in front of Akhilesh
 sapa alaakaman agar kaumi ekta dal kaa vilay bhi karata he to chunaav ke maddenjaykhilesh ko isamen adnga nahin daalana chahie

 ) It is not unheard of that the auditors do not resign before or during the audit, but such an incident has hardly been heard for a long time
 haalanki, 2018 par gaur karen to yah saamaanya lagane lag saktaa he
 After all, auditors of about 200 listed Indian companies left their jobs in the midst of the audit
 audit se pehle yaa uske dauraan kisi auditor ke istipha dene ke yun to kai kaaran ho sakate hai; lekin audit maanak or aachaar samhita kaa maamla khadaa ho jaae to kisi auditor ko jarur istipha dena chahie
 But before taking this sentence further, it is important to keep in mind that the recent resignations of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Capital and Reliance Home Finance Ltd auditor pwc are not an unusual incident
 ye to donon companiyon ke haai profile hone ke naate surkhiyon main aa gaye
 The resignation of the auditor in the middle of the audit creates a ruckus
 yah sanket detaa he ki company kii vyavastha main kuch baari gadabadi he
 This can lead to worry lines on the foreheads of its investors, lenders, creditors and other parties
 auditor ke istife se company or uske nideshak mandal kii pratishtha ko bhi dhakka pahunchataa he
 Therefore, auditors should try to complete the audit and present their report
 unke paas yah vikalp he ki ve koi shart (apni raay dene main asamarthta kaa hawala dekar) jod den yaa phir safagoi se report taiyaar kar den
 Resignation should be the last option - resigning without adequate reason is unethical and a violation of their professional obligations to shareholders and the public
 kuch saal pehle tak, istipha dekar kisi audit ko chhodie ke liye kaarnon kaa khulaasa karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 But the Companies Act 2013 changed that
 niamakon ke paas report daakhil karte vakt aisi kisi ghatana ke liye auditor or company, donon ko paryaapt vajah bataani hoti he
 Each party has the right to know why the auditors quit? pwc's resignation is of particular importance as it pertains to suspected fraud as per Section 143 (12) of the Companies Act 2013
 kanoon ke anusaar, kisi auditor ko audit ke dauraan yah vishwaas karne kaa thos kaaran miltaa he ki company ke adhikariyon yaa karmchaariyon ne ek karod rupye yaa usase adhik kii dhokhadhadi kii he, to use turant company kii audit cameti ko us sandigdh dhokhadhadi kii soochna deni chahie
 It is necessary for the audit committee to respond to the auditor within forty-five days or to express his opinion on that questionable subject
 lekha pareekshak ko us sandigdh dhokhadhadi kii jaankaree centre sarkaar ko deni chahie or audit cameti kii tippaniyon ke saath apni raay se sarkaar ko avgat karana chahie
 If he does not get the response of the audit committee, then he should send his report to the audit committee to the government
 peedblusi kaa aarope he ki reliance capital ne tay samay ke bheetar audit samiti kii baithak nahin bulaai; sambandhit companiyaan santoshjanak rup se 'kuch tippaniyon / lenden' ko saaf nahin kar sakin jo donon companiyon ke vittiya vivaranon ke liye mahatvapurn yaa aavashyak ho sakati hai; prabandhan dwaara audit ke dauraan kanoonee karrwai kii dhamkee di gai thi jiske kaaran unki audit karne kii kshamta par asar pad rahaa tha
 As such, he had no choice but to resign
 peedblusi ke istife ke baad pathak ech
 D
 and associats hi ab ekmaatr auditor ke rup main kaam jari rakhegi
 Even if the company's sole auditor gives him a clean chit and does not report the fraud, the pwc can still stand, because the pwc had only suspected the fraud, not the fraud
 haalanki, istife ke kaaran peedblusi ko mukademebaaji kaa jokhim uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The company, its investors, creditors, directors and other stakeholders can sue for defamation, which is both civil and criminal
 ve aarope laga sakate hai ki istipha dene ke dauraan diya gaya bayaan galat or bhraamak tha or peedblusi ne surkhiyon main chadhgaye yaa badla lene jaise kisi nihit swaarth ke liye us bayaan kaa istemaal kiya, yaa uski niyat main khot tha
 It is difficult to say that pwc resigned in haste due to the legal action and the proposal for punitive action against the four big audit firms
 bhartiya pratibhuti or vinimay board (sebi), rashtriya vittiya reportig praadhikaran (enegaare) or anya niamak, dastavejon kii jaanch ke baad moolyankan karenge ki kya istipha uchit tha
 But it is also unlikely that pwc would not have prepared for all this

 philistin ke pradhanmantri raami hamdalla par gaja pattee kii yatra ke dauraan jaanaleva hamalaa hua
 This information has been given by the Palestinian Interior Ministry
 grih mantralay kii jaankaree ke mutabik mangalvaar ke din jab pradhanmantri or unka kafila gaja pattee kii yatra kar rahaa tha usee dauraan kafile ko nishaanaa banaakar hamalaa kiya
 The Palestinian Prime Minister narrowly survived the murderous attack
 samachar agency kii report ke anusaar, hamdalla ek apshisht jal shodhan sanyantr kaa udghaatan karne or adhikariyon se mulaakaat karne ke liye gaja aae the
 At the same time he was attacked
 jabaki philistini news agency wafa ne kaha ki hamdalla or philistini khufia seva ke pramukh majid faraj visphot main bal-bal bache
 a total of seven people were injured in this explosion
 philistini neshnal othority ne hamaas ko is visphot ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Explain that no organization has claimed responsibility for the blast yet
 kerala ke akhabaaron ke mutabik, rajya main chote-bade kareeb 36,000 mandir hai yani kareeb 3
 a temple for about 1,000 people in a population of 5 crores
 anya dharmik sthalon ko jod liya jaae to ausat 900 logon par ek dharm centre kaa hisaab baithta he
 There is no concrete data on the calculation of religious places in India, but considering Kerala as a sample, it can be estimated that the same average of population and religious places will be more or less the same across the country
 yah ausat bharat main prati ek hajaar logon par aspataalon, skulon, police thanon, railway steshnon aadi kisi bhi saarvajanik seva se bahut bada he
 Religion is not evaluated as a community service in economic calculations, but religious system in infrastructure, systems, expansion, public participation is India's largest community service, which has its own competent and big economics
 hamen afsos hona chahie ki vishaal, samrudh or raajnneeti se gahare antarasambandh vaali hamaari sabase badi saamudayik seva is maanavadhikaar kii guarantee nahin de sakati ki log aasthaaen sanjote hue apni jindagi se haath nahin dhoyenge
 It would be a mistake to attribute the fireworks competition to the burnt-out lives of Kollam, just as we explored the lessons of the 121 death stampede at the Ratangarh temple in Datia (madhya Pradesh) in October 2013, looking for the weak bridge near the temple
 had tried
 2013 main kumbh ke dauraan elahabaad stesan par bhagdad main 36 maut yaa 2008 main chamunda devi (rajasthan main mehraangadh) main 249 maut ke liye in sthanon kaa bhugol jimmedaar nahin tha
 We are responsible who do not take this huge system of faith seriously
 honge ham takanic ke suurama lekin zyaadaatar dharmik sthalon par bheed prabandhan darasal bhed prabandhan jaisaa he
 We may have maintained dozens of rules and regulations of building construction, but the huge system of government could not ensure minimum infrastructure in the religious place
 hamaare dharm prabandhak mahilaon ko mandiron main pravesh se rokane ke liye sabase badi adaalat tak lard sakate hai lekin mandiron main logon kii jindagi surakshit rakhane ke liye adaalat ke aadesh (supreme court 2013) par kaan nahin denge
 Our religious-political leadership can spend hours debating the absurd statement of a saint about drought but there will be no debate to decide the responsibility of making religious places safe
 dharm ek saamudayik seva ke taur par bharat ko duniya se bilkul alag khadaa karata he
 The government cannot tell the total number of religious places but if we go through the data of some private studies, religious analysis and religious organizations, then we will be shocked by the dimension of expansion of community service
 bharat main kareeb 5,000 ke aasapaas to sakriy puranic hindu tirth hai jinke sandarbh pracheen sahitya yaa itihaas se aate hai
 This number rises above 6,000 by joining Buddhist, Jain, Islam, Sikh, Christian centers
 bharat main kareeb 60 bade dharmik nagar hai jahaan puraa shahar kisi dharmik centre ke irdagird hi ghumta he
 Of course, this calculation does not include the huge local system of shrines, which is the fastest spreading network between cities and rural settlements
 tirth or dharmik paryaton, mausami melon, puja or utsav bhi is vishaal network kaa hissaa hai jinhen shaamil karne ke baad, sirf logon kii bhagidaari ke aadhaar par hi dharm aisi community sarvice ban jaataa he jo kisi bhi anya saamudayik seva se zyada chaak-chauband intjaam maangati he
 Can we muster up the courage to ask ourselves whether a country would run such a huge service as religious places run in India
 bharat ke saamaajik-aarthik dhaanche main dharmik centre, ek vaastavik sampatti (tengibil asset) hai, jo saamaajik parivesh main bane rahane ke liye sansaadhan jutate hai, logon ko rojgaar dete hai or apni gatividhiyaan badhaakar majholi se badi arthvyavastha ban jate hai
 This community service of India on the basis of socio-economic property is a victim of three kinds of inconsistencies
 inamen pehali he kshamtaaon kii kami-bharat kii aabaadi ke sabase bade hisse ko dainik, saptahik masik or vaarshik aadhaar par seva dene vaale is tantra ke paas maang ke mutabik kshamtaayen nahin hai
 From a network of religious pilgrimages to medium temples, this lack of capacity is always seen as challenges to crowd management and security
 duusari asangati he viniman kii kami
 There are no rules for building or running religious sites
 sirf dharmik centre hone ke kaaran zyaadaatar sthal sabhi tarah ke nirmaan niyamon se pare hai jinamein swatchta, pradooshan, jansuvidhaon ko lekar koi vyavastha nahin dikhti
 The third challenge is economic transparency in these institutions
 zyaadaatar bade tirth or dharmik sthal sampannataa or samruddhi ke baavjood buniyadi suvidhaon main buree tarah lachar hai
 Seeing the tragedy of Kollam, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must have realized that the government that created dozens of departments, schemes, institutions could not make a mechanism to protect their large community service despite annual tragedies at the shrines
 sarkaar kii beficri se zyada chidh honi chahie saanskrithik rashtrawaad or dharmik chetana ke pairokaron kii upeksha par
 We have never seen the voice of religious associations, volunteers, councils, parties coming from the stage, how poor the pilgrimage management of India is, we have never seen the movement that before the construction of new temples, saints, voluntary organizations come together to kill the old pilgrimage
 Will prevent from hamane kabhi yah charchaa nahin suni ki desh ke kharbapati mandir va tirth apekshaakrit simit sansadhano vaale puraane tirthon ko suvidha-suraksha se sampann karenge
 The death of Kollam reminds us only that "khot is not our stars, in fact we are incompetent
" ” (shakespeare-julius sijar)
 The Pak army and the Nawaz government seem to have come face to face with the hanging of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 jadhav kii faansee par antarrashtriya court ne ste laga diya he
 In Pakistan, the army is now pressurizing the Nawaz government not to bow down to the execution of Jadhav

 Once again Pakistan's army and government have come face to face
 media reports ke mutabikpakistani senanvaaj sarkaar par dabaav bana rahi he ki kulbhushan ke maamle par jhukne kii jarurat nahin he
 The Pakistan Army said that any question of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding the death sentence of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen, will be answered at an appropriate level
 pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne jadhav ko jasusi ke aarope main maut kii sajaa sunai he
 Army spokesman General Asif Ghafoor told the media that Jadhav was sentenced to death by the military court after due process of law
 unhone kaha, agar isije jadhav ke bare main pakistan se koi aagrah karata he to pakistan sarkaar uchit str par iskaa jawaab degi
 The statement from the Army came after Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 isse pehle pradhanmantri sharif ke videsh maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ne kaha ki pakistan bhartiya naagarik jadhav kii maut kii sajaa par roak lagane ke sandarbh main isije ke adhikaar kshetra kaa vishleshan kar rahaa he
 Aziz said that Pakistan would issue a statement in the next few days
 ajij ne kaha, ham bhartiya yachika or is maamle main isije ke adhikaar kshetra kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Muhammad Asif alleged that India is using the death sentence awarded to its civilian Kulbhushan Jadhav to divert attention from its state-sponsored terrorism in the country
 asif ne twit kar kaha, isije main bharat kii apil pakistan main uske rajya pryojit antakawaad se dhyaan hataane kii koshish he
 Kulbhushan was convicted in crimes against national security
 bharat ne gat maheene pakistan kii sainya adaalat se jadhav ko di gai faansee kii sajaa ke khilaaf isije kaa ruukh kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Iran has also sought permission to interrogate Jadhav, imprisoned in Pakistan
 irani rajanyik mohammad rafee ne queta main samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan yah jaankaree di
 When asked by Iranian diplomat Rafi whether his Foreign Minister Javed Zarif had taken up Jadhav's case with his Pakistani counterparts during his recent visit to Pakistan, Rafi said it was not taken up during that time
 haalanki iske saath hi unhone kaha ki irani sarkaar ne jadhav se poochtacha karne ke liye pakistan se ijaajat maangi he
 Here he also made it clear that the matter could not progress further
 matlab pakistan ne unhen bhi manaa kar diya

 It was not even 24 hours after the Railway Budget that even the Supreme Court asked the Railways many questions
 ek yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne railway ko kaha ki bhale hi aapako bajet kii dikkat ho, lekin aapako maanavrahit crossing par ho rahi mauton ko rokane liye thos kadam uthaane hi honge
 The court said that it is not that accidents occur at every crossing, some crossings are such, where such accidents are happening, which are dangerous
 railway ko aisi khatarnaak crossing kaa pataa lagaakar court ko bataanaa chahie
 Apart from this, where there is a plan to lay new tracks, arrangements should be made in advance

 aaj kii siyasat kaa haal dekhakar bahuton ko tulsi babu kii baat par yaqiin karnaa kathin hoga
 Akshaywat Rai has been a big socialist leader of that area
 bahuton ko samaajawaadee andolan se unhone joda tha
 Tulsi Babu was telling that it is now difficult to be like that
 unhone hi tulsi babu ko 62 main chunaav ladane ke liye prerit kiya
 But money is required to contest elections
 vah kahaan se aayega! iske liye akshayavat babu kaa sutara tha

 No worker ever asked for a single penny, nor did i give anyone a penny

 Rajvanshi Babu said that of course
 jab tak aapke awaas kaa intjaam nahin hota he aap mere atithi rahiye
 a room was found in the house
 or jab tak awaas nahin mila tab tak rajwanshi babu kaa hi main atithi rahaa
 ' tulsi das mehta ji ne thodi der kii baatcheet main apana jo yah sansmaran sunaaya usko aapke saath saajha kar rahaa hum
 '' akshayavat raay us ilaake ke bade samaajawaadee netaa rahe hai
 He associated many with the socialist movement
 tulsi babu bataa rahe the ki vaisaa log hona ab mushkil he
 It was he who inspired Tulsi Babu to contest in 62 elections
 lekin chunaav ladane ke liye paise kii jarurat hoti he
 Where will he come from? Akshayavat was Babu's formula for this

 tulsi babu bataa rahe the ki chunaav abhiyaan shuru hua
 Sometimes on a bicycle, sometimes on a gig
 kisi kaaryakarta ne na kabhi ek paisa maanga or na maine kisi ko ek paisa diya
 From where will he give! It is not known from where it is coming and how the expenditure is going on
 kuch dinon ke liye ek ‘douj’ gaadi kiraye par lee gai thi
 Total six thousand rupees were spent
 ‘or main chunaav jeet gaya
 Comments iske baad tulsi babu ne jo sunaaya usapar yakeen karnaa to bahut mushkil he
 'told that he reached Patna after winning the election
 patna main kisi ko jaanata nahin tha
 Where to go, who should stay here
 bada ahm sawaal tha
 When he could not understand anything, he reached the kothi of his own Congress candidate Rajwanshi Babu
 kooparative federation ke adhyaksh ke rup main unako bada makaan mila hua tha
 i told them my difficulty and said that i want to stay with you till the mla's house is found
 rajwanshi babu ne kaha ki zarur
 You are my guest until your accommodation is arranged
 ghar main ek cameraa mil gaya
 And i was the guest of Rajbanshi Babu till i got accommodation
 ’ Tulsi Das Mehta Ji shared his memoir with me in a brief conversation
 '' Tulsi Babu was telling that the election campaign started
 kabhi cycle par to kabhi tamatum par
 No worker ever asked for a single penny, nor did i give anyone a penny
 detaa bhi kahaan se! kahaan se aa rahaa he or kaise kharchaa chal rahaa he, yah pataa hi nahin chalaa
 a 'douj' car was hired for a few days
 kul chha hajaar rupye kharch hue
 'and i won the election
 ’tippaniyan After this, it is very difficult to believe what Tulsi Babu told
 ‘bataaya ki chunaav jitkar patna pahunchaa
 Did not know anyone in Patna
 kahaan jaaun, kiske yahaan thaharuun
 It was a very important question
 jab kuch samaj main nahin aayaa to apane hi yahaan ke congressi ummidavaar rajwanshi babu kii kothi par pahunch gaya
 As president of the Cooperative Federation, he had a big house
 maine apni kathinaayee unako bataai or kaha ki jab tak vidhayak awaas nahin miltaa he tab tak aapke yahaan hi thaharnaa chahta hum
 Rajvanshi Babu said that of course
 jab tak aapke awaas kaa intjaam nahin hota he aap mere atithi rahiye
 a room was found in the house
 or jab tak awaas nahin mila tab tak rajwanshi babu kaa hi main atithi rahaa
 ' tulsi das mehta ji ne thodi der kii baatcheet main apana jo yah sansmaran sunaaya usko aapke saath saajha kar rahaa hum

 '' Tulsi Das Mehta Ji shared his memoir with me in a brief conversation
 '' Police has arrested 3 bookies from Hotel Landmark in Kanpur, accused of conspiring to influence the outcome of the match
 inke paas se kai phones or 4
 Rs 5 lakh has been recovered
 police ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki shuruaati jaanch main do gujarat team ke khilaadiyon kaa naam saamne aayaa he, lekin ve koun khilaadi hai iske bare main police kuch kehane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments aarope he ki ye khilaadi team kii jaankariyaan in bookiyon tak pahunchaate the
 These match fixers were staying in the same hotel where the players of both the teams playing the match and all the officials associated with the match were staying
 sawaal yah he ki in khilaadiyon ko usee hottle main or kuch ko usee flor main rahane kaise diya gaya jahaan par khilaadi the
 Initial investigations have also revealed that a man placing advertising hoardings inside the ground was in contact with these people and was in constant contact with the groundsman preparing the pitch
 mana ja rahaa he ki buki chaahate the ki pich par zyada pani daalkar use geela rakhaa jaae taaki match main bada score nahin bane, magar match kaa score-card dekhakar saaf he ki vah aisa karne main naakaam rahe the
 It is alleged that these players used to send information about the team to these books
 ye match fiksar usee hottle main rah rahe the jahaan match khilne vaali donon tiimon ke khilaadi or match se jude tamaam adhikari rah rahe the
 The question is how these players were allowed to stay in the same hotel and some in the same floor where the players were
 shuruaati chaanbin main yah bhi saamne aayaa he ki maidan ke bheetar edvertising hording lagane vaala ek shaks in logon se mila hua tha or vah pich taiyaar karne vaale groundsman se lagaataar sampark main tha
 It is believed that the bookie wanted to put more water on the pitch to keep it wet so that a big score would not be scored in the match, but seeing the match score card, it was clear that he had failed to do so
 mana ja rahaa he ki buki chaahate the ki pich par zyada pani daalkar use geela rakhaa jaae taaki match main bada score nahin bane, magar match kaa score-card dekhakar saaf he ki vah aisa karne main naakaam rahe the
 Rabindranath Tagore wrote 'kabuliwala' a hundred hundred years ago - in 1892
 uske kuch pehle- sambhawatah 1887 ke aasapaas- unhone ek patrika ke liye kishton main ek upanyaas 'rajarshi' likhaa
 This is the period when the first seeds of skepticism appear within Tagore regarding nationalist concepts
 'rajarshi' do bacchon kii kahani se shuru hoti he
 The king also plays with these two children playing on the banks of the Rose River near a temple
 mandir main kisi puja ke avasar par bali padati he or isse bacchee itane sadame main chali jaati he ki vah biimaar pad jaati he or ek din guzar jaati he
 The king then prohibits the sacrifice in the kingdom, the monarchy stands against him, the king's own people plot against him and eventually the king has to fight a long and non-violent battle
 yah kaayade se gandhi se pehle gandhi kaa prayog tha jo gurudev apane upanyaas main kar rahe the
 Similarly, in 'kabuliwala', they explore the displaced, migrating mankind across the border of countries, who binds an invisible thread between a Rahmat Khan and a Mini
 shaayad yah tagore kii karunaa, or manushyata ke prati unka aagrah he jo unhone ek bada lekhak banaata he
 After 50 years on 'kabuliwala', Bimal Rai makes a film in Hindi with the same name
 balraj saahani ne is film main rahamat khan kii bhoomika adaa kii he
 Almost 60 years later, this story touches a young director Deb Medhekar
 lekin yah ikkisvin sadi he- rashtrawaad europe main bikhar rahaa he to dakshin asia main kurup shaklein le rahaa he
 Families are breaking up - men and women are seeking new definitions
 in sabake bich deb medhekar kabuliwale ko laa khadaa karte hai- lekin ab uske haathon main baadaam-kishmish kii jagah biscope he
 Now he is the one with a biscope from Kabul
 mini bhi ab badi ho gai he- jis biscope vaale ne use bachapan main chhalkati khushiyaan deen, use vah bhul chuki he
 The one with a biscope is also a victim of Alzheimer's
 mini ke pita lekhak nahin, photographer hai- ek vimaan haadase main unki maut ho chuki he
 The film begins at this very difficult turn
 film main nihit naatakeeyata kii bahut sari gunjaaishon ko saavdhaanee se hataate hue film chupchaap un paraton ko kholti chalati he jinamein kuch nijee sambandhon kii duvidhaayen hai or kuch saarvajanik sawaal
 After the father's death, Mini returned after covering his remains, saying goodbye to the people who came home during his funeral - had seen only half the father's face - half the face was covered with camera, never thought of his death What will you say later? However, some clues to the troubled relationship between father and daughter are already available to the viewers
 film kii mul katha mini or rahamat khan kii hi he- jo tagore kii kahani kii bhi he
 But the film has several subtitles - a father stuck between daughter and friend who wants to start everything afresh with his daughter but cannot; Between the daughter and father of a woman who says that life has not given so much that death snatches away; a time spent inside a prison-cut man in which a father returned to the country with his daughter's hand imprinted, hoping to see him sometime; And that country, which has been turned into rubble by the dogma of religion
 kai tahon main banty, kai roopon main badali, magar phir bhi multah gurudev kii karunaa main pagi yah film bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 The subtle vision of the director is visible in many places
 rahamat khan ke rup main danni dengjongpa, mini ke taur par gitanjali thapa or mini ke pita ke taur par adil hossain kaa kaam film ko alag gaharaai or tivrata detaa he
 Amidst the human tensions of oblivion and memory, Afghanistan's vicious demolition draws attention to the irony of how humanitarian disintegration takes place under tanks, guns and bulldozers of vast national projects
 tippaniyan Just a thought, that in the 90s - when Mini would have been five years old - would Biccope have the charm that it used to be in the days before tv's arrival in Kolkata? The Biscope seems like a recreation of decades up to the seventies and maximum eighties, not a mini-toy after 90s
 phir bhi hindi filmodyog kii shor-sharabe se bhari satahi duniya main yah biscope ek tazaa hawa ke jhonke jaisaa he
 Of course, such a spurt has increased in recent years and this is beautiful
 tagore kii chote kalevar kii ek badi kahani par deb medhekar ne chote kalevar kii ek badi film bana daali he
 Perhaps it is Tagore's compassion, and his insistence on humanity that makes him a great writer
 'kabuliwala' par 50 baras baad hindi main bimal raay isi naam se ek film banaate hai
 Balraj Sahni played the role of Rahmat Khan in this film
 iske bhi qareeb 60 saal baad ek yuva nirdeshak deb medhekar ko yah kahani chooti he
 But this is the twenty first century - nationalism is disintegrating in Europe and is taking ugly forms in South Asia
 parivaar tut rahe hai- stri-purush sambandh nai paribhaashaayen maang rahe hai
 In the midst of all this, Deb Medhekar brings Kabuliwala - but now he has a biscope in his hands instead of almond-raisins
 ab vah kabul se aayaa biscope vaala he
 Minnie has also grown up - the bishop who gave her the joys she had spared in childhood, has forgotten her
 biscope vaala bhi alzimer kaa shikaar he
 Minnie's father is a photographer, not a writer - he has died in a plane crash
 is behad mushkil mode par film shuru hoti he
 Carefully removing the enormous scope of theatricality inherent in the film, the film silently opens up layers that have some personal relationship dilemmas and some public questions
 pita kii maut ke baad unke avshesh samet kar lauti mini unke antim sanskaar ke dauraan ghar aae logon ko vidaa karte hue kahati he- pita kaa sirf aadha cheharaa dekha tha- aadha cheharaa camere se dhanka rahata tha, sochaa hi nahin tha ki unki maut ke baad kya boluungi? pita or beti ke sankatagrast rishton kaa haalanki kuch suraag darshakon ko pehle hi milane lagata he
 The film's original story is of Mini and Rahmat Khan - which is also the story of Tagore
 lekin film main kai upakathaayen piroi hui hai- beti or mitra ke bich fanse pita kii jo apni beti ke saath sabakuch nae sire se shuru karnaa chahta he magar kar nahin paata; beti or pita ke bich pisi ek stri kii jo kahati he ki jivan ne itnaa kuch diya nahin he jise maut chin le; ek jail kaat rahe shaks ke bheetar tehre hue samay kii jisamen apni beti ke haath kii chhap liye paraaye mulk lautaa ek pita kabhi lautakar use dekhne kii ummid karata he; or us mulk kii, jise dharm ke kathmullepan ne malbe main badal daalaa he
 Divided into many folds, changed into many forms, but still it was not easy to make this film, which was originally in Gurudev's compassion
 nirdeshak kii sookshm drushti kai jagah dikhaai padati he
 Danny Dengzongpa as Rahmat Khan, Gitanjali Thapa as Minnie and Adil Hussain as Minnie's father give the film a different depth and intensity
 vismriti or smriti ke maanviya tanaav ke bich afghanistan kaa vedhak vidhwans is vidambnaa kii ore dhyaan khinchataa he ki kis tarah viraat rashtriya pariyojnaon ke tinkon, banduukon or bulldozeron tale maanviya dhukdhuki kuchli chali jaati he
 The comments bas, ek khyal yah aata he ki 90 ke dashak main- jab mini paanch saal kii rahi hogi- kya kolkata main biscope kaa vah aakarshan bachaa hoga jo tivi ke aagaman ke pehle vaale dinon main hota tha? biscope sattar or adhiktam assi tak ke dashakon ke manabahlav kii tarah yaad aata he, 90 ke baad kii mini ke khilone kii tarah nahin
 Yet in the noisy superficial world of the Hindi film industry, this biscope is like a breath of fresh air
 beshak, aise jhonke haal ke varshon main kuch bade hai or yah baat pritikar he
 On a big story of Tagore's Chota Kalewar, Deb Medhekar has made a big film of Chhota Kalewar
 in sabake bich deb medhekar kabuliwale ko laa khadaa karte hai- lekin ab uske haathon main baadaam-kishmish kii jagah biscope he

 ''unhone kaha ki logon ke paas basic intellegency hi nahin he, bina sthiti ko samajhe mujhe jhootha kaha
 Why should i waste my energy talking to such people? main aise logon se baat karnaa pasand nahin karti
