 Britain's famous magazine 'the Economist' has examined the work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for one year
 magazine ne modi ko 'van main band' kii sangya di he or unka aisa chitra chapa he jisamen vah akele dher saare mujeec instrument liye hue dikhaai de rahe hai
 The magazine has pointed to India's golden future, but has also strongly criticized PM Modi on many issues
 report main yahaan tak kaha gaya he ki piem modi kii soch ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri jaisi hi he, rashtriya netaa jaisi nahin
 If Modi really needs to change the country, then India's 'one Man Band' needs a new tune
 bahut dhimi he modi kii raftaar: magazinamagazine ne likhaa he ki modi ke apanedesh ke liye badi aakankshaayenhai or iske liye unhen aatmavishvaas bhi he
 But he still has to explain how he will do this work
 report ke mutabik, 'modi achche dinon kaa naaraa dekar satta main to aa gaye, lekin unki raftaar behad dhimi he
 The voters gave the BJP the maximum number of seats in the last 30 years, but hardly any other Prime Minister has retained as many rights as Modi has in his hands
 'magazine ke mutabik, bharat ko bade badlaav kii jarurat he or yah kaam 'van main band' (modi) ke liye bahut badi chunauti he
 The magazine has written that it will not take much time for India to become the most populous country in the world
 itnaa hi nahin, yah duniya kii teen badi arthvyavasthaaon main ek hoga or itihaas main pehali baar bharat kaa duniya par itnaa prabhaav hoga
 However, according to the magazine, Modi feels that there is only one person who will lead India on this path
 
 
 narendra damodaradaas modi
 The magazine also cited the reason for not doing a story on Modi during the election last year
 'da iconomist' ne likhaa he, 'hamen dharmik maamalon ko lekar unki kshamta par shaq tha
 Modi has failed to stop the fanatical Hindus, but is happy that there has been no major communal violence, which we feared the most
 ' bjp-shiv Sena alliance may get majority of 166-194 seats in BJP exit poll, bjp-shiv Sena alliance may win from 22 to 32 seats Dalbadalu or rebel candidate But it has given a chance to big bang
 india today-exis maai india ke agsit pole main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko 166-194 siten milane kii sambhaavna jataai gai he
 However, the BJP coalition under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis seems to be missing out on a double century and the rebels are also considered to be a big factor behind it
 agsit pole main bhi isse judaa dilachasp vishleshan saamne aayaa he
 According to exit poll data, Dalbadalu and rebel candidates have become a major election game changer in Maharashtra
 anumaan he ki kareeb 22 se 32 siton par dalbadalu or baagi ummidavaar chunaav jeet sakate hai
 Even BJP rebels in some seats are harming the Shiv Sena
 chunaav se pehle dikhi thi baagiyon kii chintaayun to chunaav se pehle congress or ensipi main bhi baagiyon ko lekar chintaa dekhne ko mili he, lekin bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan par iskaa kaaphi asar dekhne ko mila he
 Before the election, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had to warn that if the rebels did not leave the election ground, 'they would be shown their place'
 chunaav se pehle hi yah jaankaree aa rahi thi ki bijepi or shivasena kareeb tees siton par baagiyon ke gusse kaa saamana kar rahi he
 Till the last time of the election, the leaders of the small level have left the party
 jahaan aamane-saamne ladi bijepi or shivasenabagiyon ke alaava do siten aisi bhi hai, jahaan bijepi or shivasena ke pratyaashee aamane-saamne chunaav lade hai
 One of these seats is Kanakavali and the other is Mana
 ye donon siten aisi hai, jahaan bijepi kaa pratyaashee hone ke baavjood shivasena ne apane candidet utaare
 BJP has given ticket to Nitesh Rane, son of former CM Narayan Rane from Kanakavali seat, while Jayakumar Gore has been fielded from Mana
 ye donon hi netaa 2014 ke chunaav main congress ke tikat par jite the or haal hi main bijepi main shaamil hue the
 Therefore, on one hand, while the BJP and Shiv Sena have done the work of breaking the back of the opposition by bringing big leaders of congress-ncp in their court, on the other hand, both parties also faced rebellion of their leaders on the issue of ticket sharing

 (input ieenes se) South African batsman AB de Villiers is currently going through a bad phase
 is samay na to unke balle se lagaataar ran nikal rahe hai or na hi apni captaini main ve dakshin africa team ko jeet dilaa paa rahe hai
 De Villiers has been under the scanner of critics after the South African team's very poor performance in the Champions Trophy
 swaabhaavik he ki un par apekshaaon kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 In this difficult time, former South African captain Graeme Smith has advised de Villiers to leave the captaincy of the ODI team
 smith kaa maananaa he ki divilliars ko team kii captaini chhodkar ballebaaji par dhyaan dena chahie
 The comments smith ne british akhbaar main prakashit apane ek lekh main likhaa he ki divilliars pichley saal hi test cricket ko alavida kahana chaahate the, lekin cricket dakshin africa (siese) ne unhen ek saal aaraam karne kii salaah di, jise unhone maan liya
 Smith wrote, "I believe De Villiers was contemplating goodbye to Test cricket last year, but the CSA encouraged him and prevented him from retiring
" "unhone likhaa, "divilliars greeshmakaal main siese ke saath apane bhavishya par vichaar karenge, lekin unako meri salaah he ki vah vanade team kii captaini chhod den or agle do saal apni ballebaaji par dhyaan den
 " divilliars ne pichley saal australia ke khilaaf apana aakhri test match khelaa tha
 He did not play after that due to an elbow injury
 hashim amala ke captaini chhodane ke baad divilliars ko test team kaa captain banaaya gaya tha, lekin vah ek saal tak hi is pad par bane rahe or iske baad phalf du plasis ko team kaa captain bana diya gaya
 Smith wrote, "it is extremely important to expand the career of AB de Villiers
 saath hi yah dakshin africa cricket ke liye bhi behatar hoga
 "significantly, under the captaincy of de Villiers, the South Africa team could not even reach the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy
 pakistan or bharat ke khilaaf mili haar ke baad use group daur se hi baahar hona padaa
 The bad phase of the team did not end even after this and South Africa had to beat them in the T20 series against England
 (ieenes se input) Smith wrote in an article published in the British newspaper that De Villiers wanted to say goodbye to Test cricket only last year, but Cricket South Africa (CSA) advised him to take a year off, which he accepted
 smith ne likhaa he, "meraa maananaa he ki divilliars pichley saal hi test cricket ko alavida kehane par vichaar kar rahe the, lekin siese ne unka utsaah badhaayaa or unhen sanyas lene se roka
 "he wrote," De Villiers will consider his future with CSA over the summer, but my advice to him is to give up the captaincy of the ODI team and focus on his batting for the next two years
 " De Villiers played his last Test match against Australia last year
 iske baad kohni main chot ke kaaran vah nahin khel paae the
 De Villiers was made the captain of the Test team after Hashim Amla relinquished the captaincy, but he remained in the post for only one year and Faf du Plessis was made the captain of the team after that
 smith ne likhaa he, "yah abi divilliars ke kariyar ko vistaar dene ke liye behad jaruri he
 Also it will be better for South African cricket
 " gauratlab he ki divilliars kii captaini main dakshin africa team champiens trophy ke semifinal main bhi nahin pahunch saki thi
 After the defeats against Pakistan and India, he was dropped from the group round
 team kaa kharaab daur iske baad bhi khatm nahin hua or dakshin africa ko england ke khilaaf tii-20 siries main bhi use maat khaani padi
 (input from IANS) divilliars ne pichley saal australia ke khilaaf apana aakhri test match khelaa tha
 He did not play after that due to an elbow injury
 hashim amala ke captaini chhodane ke baad divilliars ko test team kaa captain banaaya gaya tha, lekin vah ek saal tak hi is pad par bane rahe or iske baad phalf du plasis ko team kaa captain bana diya gaya

 (ieenes se input) The International Cricket Council on Sunday appointed Michael Belaf as the Appeal Commissioner of the Indian Cricket Board to hear a petition against the one-year ban at the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi
 isisi ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘‘isisi ne ravivaar ko ghoshnaa kii ki maaikel belaaf ko isisi cricket mahaprabandhak or isisi mukhya referi ke firozshah kotla par 2010 disambar ke ant tak koi bhi antarrashtriya match yojit nahin karaane ke faisle ke khilaaf bisisiai kii yachika kii sunwaayee ke liye apil ayukta niyukt kiya

 In front of his 10,000 followers in St

 francis ne kaha ki vah duniyabar ke roman catholic carch or vatican naukarshahi main mahilaon ko mahaan bhoomika main dekhnaa chaahate hai, lekin mahilaon ke padri banane ke sabhi raste band hai
 The Church teaches that women cannot become pastors because Jesus has chosen men for this work
 ek mahila padri ke pairokaar ne is nazariye par asahmati bhi jataai or kaha ki vah apane samay ke mandandon ke anusaar kaam kar rahe hai

 In fact, the police are hopeful that the absconding serial killer will go to some blacksmith or businessman associated with a gas cutter for handcuffs
 lekin sari koshishon ke baavjood police ko serial killer arun chandrakar kaa kuch ata-pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 According to the information, police on Monday brought the serial killer Arun Chandrakar, who killed a total of seven people, including his father and wife, to the Durg court appearance, but in the meantime Arun escaped by dodging the police
 bataaya jaataa he ki somvaar ko dopaher main arun ko lekar aae police vaale peshi ke liye apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe te or court room ke baahar baithe hue the

 But in the meantime, the policeman got into a conversation with a man

 Arun Chandrakar, a resident of Kukurbeda area of raipur, killed a total of seven people, including his father and wife
 iske alaava usne anya paanch hatyaein raipur sthit apane ghar ke aas-paas ke ilaake main kin
 In 2012, during the investigation into the disappearance of a girl from Kukurbeda area, he went to police custody

 The opposition created a ruckus during Amit Shah's speech on the issue of implementing NRC

 BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said on the matter, if someone comes inside India with a mat, will he become a citizen of India
 rajyasabha sadsy subramanyam swami ne kaha, bharat koi dharmashala nahin he jahaan par koi bhi kisi bhi desh se aakar bas jaae
 At present, NRC has been implemented in Assam
 agar hamaari sarkaar pashchim bengal main aegi to ham vahaan par bhi enarasi lagu karenge
 Subramanian Swamy also said that the Tamil migrants from Sri Lanka should also be removed
 mul baat yah he ki hamaare desh kaa jab vibhaajan hua tha tab unako ek alag desh mil gaya tha
 i believe that when he got a separate country, he is living as an intruder in India
 jinke paas naagarik banane kaa adhikaar he, unako ham naagarikta de rahe hai
 We are not leaving those who are living here with illegal citizenship
 meraa maananaa he ki har praant main is tareeke se avaidh taur par jo log rah rahe hai unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaani chahie

 You know that the Indian economy has not performed well for five consecutive quarters
 2013ke baad pehali baar bharat kii jidipi5pratishat par aa gai he
 BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that if the state of the economy does not improve, Modi has only six months
 uske baad janata unhen chalange karne lagegi
 In my opinion, it will not happen because the results in the recent elections will show that Modi is the political choice of the public even after giving a poor or average economy for five and a half years
 swami ko pataa hona chahie ki abshaufaaka time nahin he ki janata ramlila maidan main chalange karegi or channel din-raat dikhaate rahenge
 The public will also eat lathi and the advertisement of that channel will be stopped
 ankar kii naukari chali jaaegi
 When the country had the highest unemployment in 45 years, the unemployed did not give importance to the question of jobs
 modi virdohi khushrahmi na paalen ki naukari nahin rahegi,to modi ko vot nahin milegaa
 Votes are received from Hindus and Muslims
 abhi aap dekh lijie,neshnal register kaa mudda aa gaya he
 Their own citizens are being deliberately put under suspicion
 unase unke bhartiya hone ke pramaan poochne kaa bhay dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Voting will be on it, not on jobs and salary
 aappbhshnchaur bainkon main kaam karne waalon se puch lijie
 They know the reason for the ruin of their institution, salary is not available, yet they have voted for Modi
 is par ve garv bhi karte hai
 So if the opponents want to challenge Modi, then create an organization
 vikalp den
 Pray that the economy should be okay even during Modi, because everyone suffers its loss
 virdohi or samarthak donon kii naukari jaaegi
 It is another matter that if the Modi government had a big idea about the economy, its result would be seen after five and a half years, which is not visible

 At this time all Indians should come forward to save the bankers from slavery and mental trouble

 The DNA report of the BJP worker whose murder was revealed in Ratlam's Kameed village last week has completely reversed
 police ke mutabik shav himmat patidaar kaa tha hi nahin, balki uske puraane naukar madan malviya kaa tha, jisaki hatya himmat ne beemaa ke 20 lakh rupee hasil karne ke liye kar di or bataaya ye gaya ki hatya himmat kii hui he
 According to the police, both the character and the director are courageous Patidars of this conspiracy, which has been created like the script of Hindi films
 jaanch ke baad ratlam espi gaurav tiwari ne bataaya ki 23 janvari ko subah saadhe aath baje doyal 100 par phone ke jariye soochna mili thi ki thana billpank ke khmed gaanv main 36 saal ke himmat patidaar kii kisi ne hatya kar di
 The body of the body was also burnt to eradicate the identity
 maamle kii jaankaree sabase pehle himmat ke pita lakshminarayan patidaar ne apane bete suresh ko di phir police ko bulaayaa gaya
 SP Gaurav Tiwari, ASP Pradeep Sharma along with FSL officer and a team of dog squad also reached the spot
 mritak ke bhai suresh patidaar kii report par thana billpank main dhara 302 or 201 ke tahat mukadmaa darj kar maamle kii jaanch shuru hui
 5 teams were formed to investigate the matter
 ghatnasthal se ennesail kii team ne mobile, purse, aadhaar card, atm ke alaava ek pocket diary bhi baraamad kii thi
 Which mentioned banks, lending and insurance
 ghatnasthal ke paas se hi mritak ke juute, motorcycle or khet main khun se sanaa ek belt bhi mila tha, jisase himmat ke parivaar ne uski pahchaan karne kaa daawa kiya
 During the interrogation, the police found out that Madan Malaviya, a resident of the village, who had worked on Himmat's farm two years ago, is also missing since January 22
 police ne jaanch main madan se jude suraag bhi talashne shuru kiye to ghatnasthal se kareeb 500 meter dur sadak kinare kuch kapade or ek jodi juute mili
 In which there was wet soil
 madan ke pita ne shinaakht main bataaya ki ye juute or kapade uske bete ke hai
 After this the police got suspicious because the mud match on the foot rest of Himmat's motorcycle was being matched with Madan's shoes
 police ne jab himmat ke kol record khangale to pataa laga ki 23 janvari kii tadake saadhe 4 baje tak uske mobile kaa istemaal hua, lekin forensik jaanch main pataa laga ki phone se kol ricard, massej, tasviren, video sab delit kar diye gayi hai
 At the same time, Himmat used to turn on the motor at his farm at night, but the motor did not turn on the day of the incident
 duusari taraf, diary main sirf vahi baaten likhi thim jisase parivaar ko phayda hota jaise beemaa, atm pin, or epady
 The postmortem report revealed to the police that the deceased was first strangled, leaving him unconscious, later stabbed in the neck four times with a sharp weapon and then burnt face to remove identification
 ab police team ne in sawaalon ke saath krime seen ko ricreat kiya, phir se tasviren lee gayi
 People from both families were talked to separately
 madan ke parivaar ne ek ahm suraag diya, unka kahana tha shav se mila undergarment madan kaa he
 Now the police's force began to change, because the zip of the jacket and pants were open in the clothes of the body
 ab bas intazaar tha diene report kaa, jiske liye police ne kapade, nakhun or baalo ke sample 24 taarikh ko hi ennesail lab sagar bhej diye the
 When the report came, the truth turned to truth because the body was not of courage but of Madan
 is sawaal kaa jawaab ratlam espi gaurav tiwari ne diya
 According to him, Madan Himmat used to work as a first-time laborer on Patidar's farm
 himmat patidaar ne 17 disambar 2018 main apana 20 lakh rupee kaa beemaa bhi karavaaya tha
 He also had a loan of ten lakh rupees
 isse bachane ke liye usne puraa shadyantra rachaa or apni hi kad lathi or umr ke madan malviya, jo ki uske khet par kaam karata tha uski hatya kar di or pahchaan chhipaane ke liye uske chehre ko jala diya
 Himmat Patidar is currently absconding and the police have announced a reward of Rs 10,000 to the person giving information
 (input- sajid khan, ratlam) The letter of former President Pranab Mukherjee tells the Election Commission to do everything that should have never been needed
 ayog ko likhi apni chitthee main pranab mukherjee ne kaha ki EVM kii suraksha kii jimmedaari puri tarah chunaav ayog kii he
 The public opinion is, above all, the basis of democracy
 use lekar koi shaq nahin ho saktaa
 He wrote that the Zimmedari Election Commission has to eliminate doubts about EVM
 meraa ye maananaa he ki koi sanstha kaise kaam kare ye tay karnaa vahaan kaam karne vaale logon par he
 It is the job of the Election Commission to maintain institutional integrity here
 ye sab unhone jis prishthbhumi main kaha he wo ise behad ahm bana detaa he
 Be aware that the last round of voting ended on 19 May
 iske baad dhire - dhire EVM ko lekar media or soshal media main alag alag video aana shuru ho gaya
 Videos accusing evms of moving or moving around without protection everywhere
 chandauli, jhaansi, dumriyaganj, gajipur or saaran se aise video aae
 On this issue, leaders of 22 opposition parties reached the Election Commission said that first the VVPAT should be counted and if the EVM and the people are not found then the VVPAT of the entire assembly should be counted
 lekin ye avishvaas kaa maahaul achaanak nahin bana he
 There was a lot of allegations about evms that they could be hacked
 lekin jab chunaav ayog ne hack karne ke liye logon ko aamantrit kiya to koi aayaa nahin
 After the result of the assembly elections, these voices were calmed down a bit
 lekin jab lok sabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan hua to alag kism ke aarope vipakshi partiyon ne lagaae
 It was said that seven rounds of elections and distribution of areas were done to benefit the ruling parties
 maamla bigadataa gaya kyonki aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke maamle main piem modi par jo sawaal uthe usamen chunaav ayog clin chit detaa gaya
 The differences within the Election Commission came to light on this when Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa's letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora came out about not recording his separate opinion
 uske baad lakh safai bhi kaam naa ai
 Opposition parties constantly talked about the bias of the Election Commission
 or avishvaas kaa ek aisa maahaul bana ki voting khatm hone ke baad EVM se ched-chhaad kaa dar sataane laga
 And because today every man has a mobile phone with camera as well as uses social media
 is vajah se ye kai guna bade asar ke saath saamne aa rahaa he
 Even the common people are not ready to accept the cleanliness of the Election Commission
 lekin jesa purv raashtrapati pranab mukharji ne kaha - zimmedaari ayog kii hi he ki wo logon ke man main baithe avishvaas ko kaise dur kare
 YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy is also gearing up for the next year's Lok Sabha elections
 jagan ek baar phir apane doston or logon kaa dil jeetne kii koshishon main jute gaye hai
 He has indicated that his party may do some major manipulation in the wake of elections
 india today group se exclusive baatcheet main jagan se jab poocha gaya ki kya unki party narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bijepi se gathbandhan kar sakati he to unhone kaha, 'kyon nahin! koi bhi achhut nahin he
 We are keen to work with Modi
 jo bhi hamaari maango ko maanegaa ham uske saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Jagan once again made it clear that his party will not form an alliance with any party that wants to divide Andhra Pradesh
 unhone kaha, 'uniphoid andhra hamaari ekmaatr demand he
 We can tie up with any party that says that Andhra Pradesh will not be divided
 aisa hi log bhi chaahate hai or yahi hamaari party bhi chaahati he
 'BJP is looking for new parties to strengthen the NDA in view of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi telugana ke gathan kaa samarthan kar chuki he
 Modi had spoken in support of Telangana state during his Hyderabad rally
 jagan uniphoid andhra pradesh ke liye kai diggaj netaaon se mil rahe hai
 In the last few days, he has met the Chief Ministers of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Punjab
 unhone in sabhi mukhyamantriyon se guzarish kii ki wo congress ko samarthan na den kyonki jo unke rajya ke saath ho rahaa he wo in rajyon ke saath bhi ho saktaa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party's dilemma over the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections is increasing
 rajya se aane vaale bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ko ab mahagathbandhan kaa dar sataane laga he
 They feel that if the Grand Alliance is formed how will the BJP be taken to the point of victory in that situation
 darasal, yah bhoot bihar kaa he
 Even after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's smokeless rallies and meetings were held, the BJP in Bihar was troubled in the 2015 assembly elections
 ab jabaki ek vaise himehagathbandhanaki koshishen uttar pradesh main tej ho gai hai, bhaajapa ko haar kii chintaa phir se sataane lagi he
 Some senior BJP leaders assess that if a grand alliance is formed, the Muslim vote in the state will stop and this is not good news for the BJP
 darasal, bhaajapa ke apane jaateey ganit ke alaava yah baat bhi bahut ahm he ki rajya menmuslim votbante
 If the Muslim vote is divided between the SP and the BSP, then it will be a direct advantage that the BJP will fight against two weaker parties in the state in a triangular contest and not with one strong opponent
 isse unke liye jeet kii sthitiyaan aasaan hotin
 But perhaps this calculation of BJP is now being watered down
 kalah kaa laabhpahale bhaajapa is baat ko lekar khaasi chintit thi ki samaajawaadee party main aantarik kalah badhati ja rahi he
 One can say that how the bickering of Yadav family related to BJP
 darasal, yadav parivaar kii kalah se musalmaan vot tezi se basapa kii ore jaataa nazar aayaa
 This was not good news for the BJP
 mayawati isbaar kaa chunaav dalit-muslim sameekaran par lard rahi hai
 From Deobandis to Dalit forums, the slogan of Dalit Muslim unity is being repeated in the state
 alpsankhyakon kii maangon or unke upar atyaacharon ko lekar mayawati sapa se kahin adhik mukhar bhi raheen
 The instability of the SP gave Muslims an opportunity to see the BSP as a strong alternative against the BJP
 isse mayawati kii sthiti behatar hui or bhaajapa ko apane liye ladaai kathin hoti dikhaai di
 But as conditions changed and Akhilesh Yadav emerged stronger and stronger, it seemed that the Muslim vote was, in fact, still committed to the SP
 wo basapa kii ore ummid se dekh to rahaa he lekin sapa se uskaa puri tarah mohabhang nahin hua he
 The BJP was happy with this
 kyonki muslim vot kaa bantna bhaajapa ke liye acchhee khabar he
 The BJP wants the Muslim vote to be divided into two or three parties rather than one party
 mahagathbandhan kaa bhaytaza sthitiyon main sapa or nirnaayak hokar ubhari he
 Akhilesh has emerged with his clean, powerful and combative image and it has become clear that Akhilesh has emerged as the most popular and strong leader in the SP
 pichley saadhe chaar saal kii kamazori or saadhe chaar mukhyamantriyon vaali chhavi se akhilesh ko mukti mili he
 There is also a sympathy wave for Akhilesh, who is being surrounded by discord
 akhilesh apane abtak ke raajnneetik kariyar main sabase behatar sthiti main aa gaye hai or yah unki party ke liye ek sakaaratmak sanket he
 In this entire situation, the efforts of the Grand Alliance have also intensified
 lalu prasad yadav se lekar ajit singh tak sapa ke saath khadey hone ke sanket de chuke hai
 Nitish Kumar will also be seen standing in the front standing against the BJP, if not today
 congress bhale hi prashanth kishor kii mulaayam singh yadav se mulaakaat ko kishor kii nijee koshish qaraar de rahi ho, lekin mahagathbandhan kii ore congress bhi khuli ankhon se dekh rahi he or agar siton ke bantwaare par ek sahmati ban paati he to congress bhi is mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hogi
 It will happen that Mayawati can come on the number three battle and the Grand Alliance can give a tough fight to the BJP with a strong ethnic arithmetic
 unke paas jaaton ko saadhane ke liye ajit singh, ati pichhadon ko saadhane ke liye nitish kumaar, yadavon or musalamaanon ko saadhane ke liye mulaayam singh yadav or lalu prasad, yuvaaon ko saadhane ke liye akhilesh yadav, gair-jatav jatiyon ko saadhane ke liye congress jaise chehre honge
 In the face of the Grand Alliance, Mayawati may be weak because Muslims may see this Grand Alliance as a strong alternative and mobilize in its favor
 mayawati ke liye to yah buree khabar he hi, lekin sabase zyaada bechaini bhaajapa ko ho rahi he
 The UP assembly election is the semifinal of the 2019 Lok Sabha election
 bhaajapa ke liye uttar pradesh haarana kaaphi mahangaa pad saktaa he
 And the grand alliance is increasing this fear

 Deoband was asked, if the brain is found to be underdeveloped in a fetus of three to four months, is abortion allowed? Deoband has responded to this, before four months, abortion can be performed in the condition of compulsions until the fetus is in the spirit, but abortion is not allowed after the fetus has entered
 bhrun ke chaar maah kaa hone par allaah usamen ruh daal detaa he
 Deoband, however, termed the information given by medical devices as unreliable in this edict
 sanstha ke mutabik, chikitsak chikitsiya upkarnon ke madhyam se jo jaankaree dete hai, vah nishchit or sampurna nahin hoti, isliye unke shabdon ke aadhaar par koi faisla nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Although this fatwa has been welcomed by people associated with Islam, but people associated with the medical world do not agree to challenge the medical devices in it
 peshey se chikitsak dow rehana ansaari ne kaha, yah baat sahi he ki bhrun hatya nahin kerani chahie, lekin yah bhi koi tark nahin he ki bhrun ke aviksit hone par bhi garbhpaat nahin karana chahie
 Dr
 Rehana said that the information given by medical devices proves to be 90 percent accurate and there is no other way to know the status of the fetus, in such a way, to say that the information obtained by these methods is not accurate, there is no hugging
 
 vahiin saamaajik kaaryakarta ismail rahamaan kaa maananaa he ki islam main bhrun hatya haraam he or aise main sanstha kaa yah fatwa logon ko bhrun hatya se rokane main madadgaar sabit hoga
 Rahman said, feticide is forbidden in every religion of the world and especially in Islam it is absolutely forbidden
 kai baar log alag-alag bahaanon se bhrun hatya karaate hai, aise main devband kaa yah fatwa un logon ko aisa karne se rokegaa

 lekin is maamle main kuch aise tathy haath lage hai, jinase lag rahaa he ki is hatyakand ke peeche aaropee ke alaava kuch or logon kii sajeesh thi
 The 3 page note which the accused has left near the corpse of the deceased is in the Roman script, while the accused is educated only till the 10th
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya kuch log aaropee shanbhu dayaal raigar ke dimag main lav jihad kaa jehar bhar rahe the
 And did anyone dictate the phone in writing the note after the murder
 police ne khud mana he pichley 2 saalon se vah kattarpanthi hindu sahitya pard rahaa tha or kuch logon ke sampark main tha, jinase vah is tarah kii saamagree letaa tha
 During this period, some people were providing such love jihad and literature to Hindu nation to the accused
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir koun log the, jinhone shanbhu dayaal ke dimag main itani nafrat bhar di
 Police say that all this poison was filled in his mind through films like Hindu Rashtra, Love Jihad, Reservation and Padmavati and PK
 use hindu ekta ke naam par bhadakaayaa gaya
 He was a Dalit himself, but was against reservation in the name of Hindu unity
 dalit aarakshan ke khilaaf uski likhi baaten bhi mili hai
 In such a situation, the big question is who were he in contact with, who tricked him and pushed him on the path of fundamentalism
 paas pados ke logon kaa bhi kahana he ki police kaa kahana he ki vah niyamit rup se kuch hindu sanghathanon ke sampark main tha or din bhar isi tarah ke video dekhtaa rahata tha
 The police have also got many such youtube videos, news footage of a lot of channels from the accused, which were related to the hindu-muslim dispute
 police kaa kahana he ki vah jis maansik sthiti main rahane laga tha, use mohammad bhatta shaikh ki jagah koi bhi muslim vyakti miltaa, usee ko maar daalata
 However, the police have not confirmed his involvement with any Hindu organization
 uske dimag main lav jihad kaa dar itnaa paith chukaa tha ki apni 13 saal kii beti ko lekar bhi daraa rahata tha or use akelaa nahin chhodana chahta tha
 He thought that someone would pick up his daughter
 yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki 2 saal pehle vah pashchim bengal gaya tha apane mohalle se gaayab ek ladki ko laane ke liye
 He had told this to the locals that he had gone to fetch the girl, but the girl refused to come and sent him back and said that his life could be in danger
 jaankaree ke mutabik, beete 2 saalon se vah koi kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 He had borrowed a lakh rupees from the woman he was in contact with, who was not returning it
 uske paise maangati thi to wo afrajul se mili hone kaa aarope laga tha
 Householders have to say that for the last 2 years no one was working, earlier PWD used to contract in the department
 uske baad kishangarh se marble laakar uskaa kaarobaar karne laga
 But after a few days he also stopped working
 vah akele hi jaataa tha or der raat tak lautataa tha
 Shambhu Dayal's parents live in Anand, Gujarat, while at home he lives with his wife, two daughters aged 16 and 13, and a son of 11 years
 uski 13 saal kii choti betimansik rup se kamajorhai
 Although Shambhu will be punished by the family or say that if he has committed a crime, they will not defend him
 vahiin rajasthan ke DGP kaa kahana he rajya kii kanoon vyavastha or phija ko kisi ko bigaadane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 The dgp's statement is clearly indicating that the police has information that some people are behind the poisoning in the mind of the accused
 police ne ashanka jataai he ki maukey par 2 logon se zyada log the
 However, the police do not want to make all the disclosures yet
 police ne yah bhi nahin bataaya he ki video bana rahaa aaropee kaa bhaanja sajeesh main shaamil tha yaa nahin

 Especially since Virat Kohli does a very good dance, we also saw in Yuvraj Singh's marriage that Virat Kohli was dancing with Anushka Sharma

 1-3, Gayantri Sadan, Gayantri Marg, Opposite District Counseling, Sawai Jai Singh, Highway, Bani Park, Jaipur, Rajasthan - 302016 mahagathbandhan tuutane ke baad jediu ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ne baagi tevar apana liye hai
 He has opened a front against Nitish
 sharad yadav ne aaj apni siyaasi raah talash karne ke liye vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karke sajhi viraasat bachaao sammelan kiya
 But political leaders have already lost ground under the feet of leaders and parties with which Sharad has gone to measure his political power
 sharad ke aaj ke sammelan main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi, purv piem manmohan singh, seetaram yechuri, gulam nabi aaazaad, faruk abdulla, ramgopal yadav, tarik anwar, prakaash ambedkar, tiemasi saansad sukhendu shekhar raay, jayant choudhary samet vipaksh ke kai netaa shaamil hue
 Kadashrad Yadav's Congress will be the most attended by the Congress leaders
 isse saaf he ki unhen congress se kaaphi ummiden hai
 But even before the feet of the Congress, political ground is slipping
 aaj kii taarikh main congress ke paas uttar bharat main punjab or himachal pradesh ke sivaa koi rajya nahin bachaa he, jahaan wo satta main ho
 The question is, which Congress has failed to save its political land, how successful will it be in strengthening Sharad's political land
 sapa ke sahare kisi hogi naiya parsharad yadav ko duusari sabase badi ummid samaajawaadee party he
 That is why SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav attended the conference
 jabaki samaajawaadee party ke angan main khud hi ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Due to this, Akhilesh Yadav lost power in the 2017 assembly elections and the party came down from fifty to 232 mlas
 aise main jahaan espi apana vajood bachaane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he to wo sharad ke liye us tinke se zyada nahin he jiske duubate kaa sahaara banane kii baat hoti he
 How will the strong left parties be weakened by the support of the Left
 bengal se satta ganvaane ke baad unke vajood par hi khatra mandaraane laga he
 In such a situation, how strong will the leftist Sharad Yadav's political land be? vaise bhi vampanthi dalon kaa jin rajyon main aadhaar bachaa bhi he vahaan sharad kaa apana koi aadhaar nahin he
 Bharosharad Yadav of the Zero BSP is looking at the BSP with hopeful eyes to strengthen his political ground
 lekin maujuuda daur main bispi khud hi itani kamjor ho chuki he ki aaj loksabhaa main uskaa ek bhi saansad nahin he
 BSP used to have a base UP
 2012 ke baad se lagaataar bispi yahaan se chunaav harati aa rahi he or 2014 va 2017 main to use buree tarah maat mili he
 Despite this, Sharad Yadav remains hopeful of the BSP
 jinka koi nahin, unase bhi asasharad yadav in partiyon ke alaava chote chote siyaasi dalon se bhi apni siyaasi raah majboot karne kii ummiden paale hai
 That is why he also called Prakash Ambedkar's party Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, RLD and NCP in his program
 in raajnneetik partiyon ko apana siyaasi vajood bachaane ke liye khud hi sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he to aise main sharad ke siyaasi kariyar ko ye kitni sanjivani de sakengi
 Lalu Yadav's party RJD is the light of hope for the political path of the last candidate from RJD
 darasal sharad kii siyaasi jameen kaa aadhaar bihar he or lalu yadav kaa bhi
 Not only this, the enemies of both the parties are also the same, in such a situation they can be lifesaving for each other
 kyonki nitish kaa bijepi se haath milaane se muslim or yadav matadaataaon main naaraazgi badi he
 In such a situation, if Lalu and Sharad come with each other, then the political ground of both can be strong

 Do not insult Veer Savarkar, Shiv Sena's advice, Mayawati said - Shiv Sena should not tolerate Congress attitude; Savarkar's issue has once again arisen after the Maharashtra elections
 congress netaa rahul gandhi kaa sawarkaar par diya gaya bayaan shivasena ko nagavar gujara he
 In Maharashtra, senior Shiv Sena leader of alliance partner Sanjay Raut has termed Rahul Gandhi's statement as unfortunate
 sanjay raut ne rahul gandhi ko saavarkar par thodaa padhane kii naseehat bhi de daali
 Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati has targeted the Congress
 mayawati ne ravivaar ko twit kar kaha, shivasena apane mul agenda par abhi bhi kaayam he, isliye inhone naagarikta sanshodhan bill par centre sarkaar kaa saath diya or ab saavarkar ko lekar bhi inako congress kaa ravaiya bardaasht nahin he
 Still, the Congress party remains with the Shiv Sena in the Maharashtra government, if all this is not a double character of the Congress, what else is it? Let's talk, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday apologized to the BJP in Delhi Attacking the demand, he said that his name is not 'rahul Savarkar', his name is Rahul Gandhi and he will not apologize for speaking the truth
 unhone kaha ki maafee (pradhanmantri)narendra modior grahamantri amit shah ko is desh se maangani chahie
 Rahul Gandhi was addressing a large gathering at the 'bharat Bachao Rally' organized by the Congress at Ramlila Maidan
 unhone kaha, kal sansad main bhaajapa ke logon ne kaha ki aap apane bhaashan ke liye maafee mangiye
 But let me tell you that my name is not 'rahul Savarkar', my name is 'rahul Gandhi'
 mar jaaoongaa, magar maafee nahin maangoonga
 i will not apologize for telling the truth
 congress kaa koi vyakti maafee nahin maangega
 Rahul Gandhi had made a 'rape in India' remark during an election rally in Jharkhand, on which BJP members demanded his apology in Parliament on Friday
 rahul kii is tippanee ko lekar sansad main kaaphi hangaam hua tha
 The Shiv Sena has also retaliated on this
 shivasena ne rahul gandhi kaa bagaiyr naam liye unhen saavarkar kaa apmaan na karne kii naseehat di he
 Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut tweeted in Marathi, "we also consider Pandit Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, don't insult Veer Savarkar
 budhimaan logon ko zyada bataane kii jarurat nahin hoti
 "in another tweet, he said that Veer Savarkar is respected not only for Maharashtra but for the entire country

 The country's largest iron ore company NMDC has priced iron ore at 5 for the january-march quarter
 22 pratishat badha die hai
 This move by NMDC may also cause domestic steel companies-jsw and Tata Steel to raise prices of their products
 enemdisi ke chairman rana som ne kaha, hamaari keemat nirdhaaran samiti kii haal main hyderabad main baithak hui thi
 Based on the recommendation of the committee, we have iron ore prices for january-march 5
 22 pratishat badaye hai
 Som said that this step has been taken in view of decreasing supply of iron ore globally and increasing demand
 2010 kii pehali chamahi main enemdisi ne kai baar louh ayask ke daam badaye the
 Thereafter, in the october-december quarter, the company reduced the prices of iron ore by five percent
 isse pehle company ne april-june kii timahi main louh ayask ke daam 90 pratishat tak badhaakar 120 se 135 dollars prati ton kar die the
 In the subsequent quarter (july to September), the company raised the price to $ 145 per ton
 ispaat udyog kaa kahana he ki louh ayask ke daam badhane se sabhi companiyaan prabhavit hongi
 In such a situation, they may have to increase prices to maintain their profits
 jeesdblyoo ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki company keemton main badhotaree par vichaar kar rahi he, haalanki abhi antim faisla nahin kiya gaya he
 Tata Steel officials could not be contacted for this
 is moolyavriddhi kaa asar desh kii sabase badi ispaat utpaadak cell par padane kii sambhaavna nahin he, kyonki vah apni jaruraton ko apane khud ke bhandar se puraa karti he

 The level of aqi, which was 49 on 17 and 18 August, was better than the previous year aqi pollution of North India was in the headlines of media and social media last week
 haalanki, pramukh shaharon main hawa kii gunvattta yani air quality index (AQI) kaa ausat neeche aayaa he, phir kai shaharon main hawa kii gunvattta kaa str kharaab bana hua he
 Delhi is the central headquarters of the central government and the severity of pollution here shook the city
 dilli ke pradooshan ke bare main kai vaigyanik adhyayan bhi kiye gaye hai
 In order to understand Delhi's pollution, India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) found that in this entire year, Delhi got only two days of clean air to breathe
 agar AQI kaa str 50 se neeche rahata he to mana jaataa he ki hawa kii gunvattta acchhee he
 From January 1, 2019 to November 5, only two days passed in the capital Delhi when the AQI level was below 50 for 24 hours
 17 or 18 agast ko (donon din)dillimein AQI kaa str 49 rahaa
 It was good as well as bad
 acha isliye kyonki 2018 main dilli main ek bhi din aisa nahin gujara tha jo 'achche' ke shrenee main aae or bura isliye kyonki hawa kii 'acchhee' gunvattta vaale dinon kii sankhya behad kam rahi
 If we look at the average, the AQI level in Delhi till November 4 this year was better than the previous year
 1 janvari se lekar 4 november tak dilli main AQI kaa ausat str 195 rahaa
 In 2018, it was 204 in the same period
 haalanki, is saal isamen 9 ankon kii giravat darj hui, lekin ausat AQI main sudhaar hua or yah 'kharaab' se 'madhyam' kii shrenee main aa gaya
 Compared to 2018, the average AQI has declined by 4% in 2019, that is, Delhi's pollution has come down by 4%
 aankadon par gaur karne par pataa chalata he ki is saal hawa kii gunvattta ke maamle main ‘kharaab’ or ‘bahut kharaab’ shrenee ke dinon kii sankhya main ullekhneey giravat ai he
 There were 102 days in 2018 in Delhi when the air quality was of 'poor' category
 2019 main ‘kharaab’ shrenee ke dinon kii sankhya ghatakar 85 ho gai
 Similarly, the number of 'very poor' quality days was 39 in 2018 to 34 in 2019
 is tarah ‘kharaab’ or ‘bahut kharaab’ hawa kii gunvattta vaale dinon kii sankhya 22 kam ho gai
 However, there has been a partial increase in the number of days considered 'severe'
 1 janvari se 4 november tak kuch 11 din aise gujarey jab dilli kii hawa main AQI kaa ausat 24 ghanton ke liye 400 se zyada tha
 The number of such days was 10 in the same period last year
 2018 se 2019 tak 'achche dinon' kii sankhya 0 se badhkar 2 ho gai
 The number of satisfactory (AQI 51–100) days has increased from 53 to 57 and the average (AQI 101–200) number of days has increased from 103 to 118
 dilli main 118 din aise rahe jab hawa kii gunvattta (AQI 100-200) ausat rahi, 2018 main aise dinon kii sankhya 103 thi
 Thus there was an increase of 21 days in good to average quality days
 koun sa maheenaa sabase pradooshit?agar maheene-waar AQI kaa aankada dekhen to pataa chalata he ki november ke din sabase zyada pradooshit rahe, lekin chunki november main abhi sirf chaar din beete hai isliye november ko hamane philhal vishleshan se baahar rakhaa he
 The figures for November will be updated later this month
 is tarah november se pehle dekhen to janvari is saal kaa sabase pradooshit maheenaa rahaa, jabadillimein AQI kaa ausat 326 rahaa jo ki ‘bahut kharaab’ kii shrenee main aata he
 After this, February was at number two with 239 (bad) AQI and October was at number three with 234 AQI
 agast or sitambar do aise maheene gujarey jisamen hawa kii gunvattta sabase acchhee rahi
 The AQI averaged 86 (satisfactory) in August and 97 (average) in September
 iske alaava, sirf do maheene aise gujarey jab ausat AQI 100 se neeche rahaa
 The tussle that started between Maharashtra government and MNS over toll tax is taking its name
 taaja maamle main manase kaaryakarta or samarthak raaj thakare kii jansabha main shaamil hone ke liye bina toll chukaaye mumbai se pune gaye
 Raj Thackeray's wife Sharmila Thackeray was also among those who did not pay the toll
 jaankaree ke anusaar, samarthakon ne sharmila thakare se aagrah kiya tha ki vah manase pramukh dwaara toll ke khilaaf shuru kiye gaye andolan main shaamil hon
 In such a situation, Sharmila proceeded without paying the toll at Khalapur toll block in Raigad district
 sharmila ne kaha, 'hamane toll kaa bhugtan karnaa band kar diya he
 We did not pay toll even this time
 sarkaar jab tak hisaab nahin detii ham toll kaa bhugtan nahin karenge
 He further said that people should show courage to break the rules and get information
 alcohol ke seven main thodi-si kami karne se bahut-sari bimariyon ke hone kaa khatra kam ho jaataa he or isse hajaaron logon kii jaan batch sakati he
 a study at the University of Oxford states this
 vartmaan main britain main purushon ke liye alcohol ke seven kaa surakshit str teen se chaar unit he, jabaki mahilao main yah str do se teen unit he
 1 in a small glass of wine
 3 unit alcohol kii maatra hoti he, jabaki ek pint (lagbhag dedh pav) glass ke bear main kam se kam do unit alcohol maujuud hota he
 Now a new study has said that the reduction in alcohol consumption levels by half a unit per day can reduce the number of untimely deaths of alcoholics by 4,579
 shodhakartaaon ne apane is adhyayan main kaha ki bimariyon ko rokane ke liye pratidin kiye jane vaale sharaab ke seven main lagbhag ek unit kii kami or ek pint glass bear kii maatra main ek-chauthai kami karne se bimariyon par rokthaam karne main madad milti he
 For this study, the Oxford-based British Heart Foundation Health Promotion Research Group analyzed 11 alcoholic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, liver disease
 isse pataa chalaa ki pratidin alcohol ke seven kii maatra main aadhe unit kii kami se samay se pehle hone vaale lagbhag 4,579 mauton ko roka ja saktaa he

 ’’ The Indian captain also defended the decision to field spinner r Ashwin in the third Test with four fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mere liye yah kahana aasaan nahin hoga ki agar aswin khel rahaa hota to uskaa adhik prabhaav hota
 He is a good spinner but you have to see the situation
 agar aap match ko dekho to yah tej gendbaajon ke paksh main adhik rahaa
 '' dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘test cricket main ek yaa do buree paariyaan ho sakati hai lekin kul milakar saat test match, yah ballebaaji kram ke vifal rahane ke liye kaaphi lanbaa samay he
 "dhoni said that this is the worst phase of Indian cricket and he blamed the batsmen for the failure
" unhone kaha, ‘‘maine jitna cricket dekha he, nishchit taur par usamen yah sabase bure daur main se ek he jahaan ham lagaataar acha pradarshan nahin kar paae hai
 We have failed to score runs
 gendbaaji kii baat karun to mujhe lagata he ki choton ke kaaran hamen nuksaan uthaanaa padaa lekin hamaare pradarshan main nirantarata nahin he
 "overall, i don't think bowling is a matter of real concern, we have not been consistently batting well, our batting order has consistently failed," he said
 ’’ australia ke lachar pradarshan ke baad kuch senior cricketron ko baahar karne kii purv khilaadiyon kii maang par dhoni ne kaha ki aisa faisla khilaadiyon or bisisiai ko saath baithkar lenaa chahie
 Dhoni said, "as far as the exclusion of great players is concerned, it should be through a process
 maine ab tak baithkar is bare main nahin sochaa he
 The players and the BCCI all need to be a part of it
 yah sahi faisle lene kaa maamla he
 People were demanding that Virat be dropped but in this Test he batted very well
 ’’ Dhoni said, "maybe it can happen after the series is over (discuss the future of senior players)
" yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki seniors kya mahasoos kar rahe hai
 It seems that there is a lot of emphasis on how to exclude senior players
 jaisaa ki main kah chukaa hum ki yah kaaphi saavdhaanee se liya faisla hona chahie kyonki unhone desh ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he or unke paas anubhav he jo ve yuvaaon ke saath baant sakate hai
 The Indian captain, however, is not in favor of dropping all the senior players and said that the team needs them so that the young players can learn
 dhoni ne haalanki captaini ke ranneetik muddon par apana bachaav kiya
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘‘main ranneetik taur par khud ko doshi nahin tehraata kyonki isse sabhi khilaadi jude hote hai
 It is very important to carry out the strategy
 agar sabhi ek hi line par gendbaaji karte hai to aapke paas kshetrarakshan ke dauraan us hisse kaa bachaav karne or kaich lapakane ke liye kshetrarakshakon ko khadaa karne kaa mauka hota he
 Dhoni took a dig at former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, who criticized his batting and captaincy, saying, "only i know whether i am taking it seriously or not
" jahaan tak ballebaaj or captain ke rup main pradarshan kaa sawaal he to main isse chintit hum
 Everybody is assigned a task
 aap is team kaa hissaa apni kaabiliyat ke kaaran hai
 '' bhartiya captain ne tisare test main spinner aar aswin ko baahar karke chaar tej gendbaajon ke saath utarane ke faisla kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 He said, "it would not be easy for me to say that if Ashwin were playing, he would have more influence
 vah acha spinner he lekin aapako halaat dekhne honge
 If you look at the match, it was more in favor of fast bowlers
 ’’ He said, "of all the cricket i have seen, it is definitely one of the worst times in which we have not been able to perform consistently
" ham ran banane main vifal rahe hai
 Talking about bowling, i think we suffered due to injuries but there is no consistency in our performance
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘kul milakar mujhe nahin lagata ki gendbaaji asal chintaa kii baat he, ham lagaataar acchhee ballebaaji nahin kar paar rahe hai, hamaara ballebaaji kram lagaataar naakaam rahaa he
 On the former players' demand to drop some senior cricketers after Australia's poor performance, Dhoni said that such a decision should be taken by the players and the BCCI
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak mahaan khilaadiyon ko baahar karne kaa sawaal he to yah ek prakriya ke jariye hona chahie
 i have not yet sat down and thought about it
 khilaadiyon or bisisiai sabhi ko iskaa hissaa banane kii jarurat he
 It is a matter of taking the right decisions

 It also has to be seen what the seniors are feeling
 aisa lag rahaa he ki is par kaaphi jor diya ja rahaa he ki kaise senior khilaadiyon ko baahar kiya jaae
 As i said, it must be a very careful decision because they have done so much for the country and they have the experience that they can share with the youth
 ’’ bhartiya captain haalanki sabhi senior khilaadiyon ko baahar karne ke paksh main nahin hai or unhone kaha ki team ko unki jarurat he jisase ki yuva khilaadi sikh saken
 Dhoni however defended himself on strategic issues of captaincy
 tippaniyan "I don't blame myself strategically because all the players are attached to it," he said
 ranneeti ko anjaam tak pahunchaana kaaphi ahm hota he
 If everyone bowls on the same line, you have a chance to defend the area during fielding and field the fielders to catch catches
 ’’ dhoni ne apni ballebaaji or captaini kii aalochana karne vaale purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ‘‘sirf main hi jaanata hum ki main ise gambhirtha se le rahaa hum yaa nahin

 '' centre sarkaar ne hoicourt main halafanama daayar kar kaha he ki jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla kii patni ko sarkari bangala nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Behind this, the Center has argued that a bungalow cannot be given to any non-government person on the basis that it has got z category security
 umr kii patni kaa sarkaar se lenaa-dena nahin he
 So there is no basis to give them a bungalow
 jammu kashmir sarkaar ne bhi apana jawaab hoicourt ko dete hue kaha he ki khudumar abdullabhi dilli ke nizamuddin ke ghar main Z+ suraksha ke saath rahe hai
 In such a situation, to say that security is possible only in Type 8 bungalow, this talk of Payal Abdullah is just an excuse not to vacate the bungalow

 Payal Abdullah had petitioned that the Type 8 bungalow at 7 Akbar Road in Delhi should not be evacuated for security reasons
 paayal or unke 2 bete philhal dilli ke is bangale main rah rahe hai
 This bungalow was given to him when Omar Abdullah became a minister in 1999 and even when he was not a minister, the bungalow was not evacuated due to security reasons
 paayal ne kaha- chote bangale main rahanaa mushkilpayal ne apni yachika me kaha he ki suraksha ke liye unako z security or beton ko z plus security di gayi he, jisamen kareeb 94 suraksha karmi he, agar unase tip 8 bangala khaali karvaa liya jaataa he to itane surakshakarmiyon ke liye chote bangale me rahanaa mushkil he
 At the same time, the central government had ordered to vacate the bungalow on the basis that Omar Abdullah is no longer in the government
 bataa den ki umr abdulla or unki patni paayal saal 2011 se alag rah rahe hai

 What is GDP? The most important measure to measure the economic health of any country is GDP figures
 ye aankade bataate hai ki desh kii aarthik sthiti kya he or aane vaale dinon main arthvyavastha kii kya disha hogi
 GDP figures in India are calculated on a quarterly basis every third month
 ye aankade mukhya taur par aath audyogic kshetron- krishi, khanan, menuphaccharing, bijli, construction, vyapaar, raksha or anya sevaaon ke kshetra ke hote hai
 After this, only the data that the CSO releases is considered official

 The CSO then calculates it and releases the figures
 jidipi ke yahi aankade aadhikarik maane jate hai
 What is your connection to GDP? GDP figures also affect the common people
 jidipi ke aankadon main giravat kii vajah se ausat aay kam ho jaati he or log garibi rekha ke neeche chale jate hai
 Apart from this, the pace of creation of new jobs is also reduced
 vahiin logon kaa bachat or nivesh bhi kam ho jaataa he
 In these conditions, people reduce the purchase, then companies reduce the production

 What is more surprising then is that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has instructed the administration of three border districts to take measures to prevent people left outside NRC from entering the state
 is baat ko lekar koi spashtataa nahin he ki un logon kaa kya hoga, jinke naam enarasi se gaayab honge
 The confusion has increased even more
 ashankaon ko shant karne ke liye kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha he ki enarasi se ‘gaayab’ logon ko hiraasat main nahin rakhaa jayega

 According to Supreme Court lawyer Upamanyu Hazarika, people who are out of NRC will not automatically become foreigners
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘unke khilaaf koi bhi karrwai shuru karne se pehle unhen ek panchat se videshi ghoshit karwaanaa hoga
 If, say, 20 lakh people are out, then there will be 20 lakh cases in front of 100 tribunals

 Of course, the intricacies of the issue of illegal migrants in Assam wrote the script for this unique 'solution' —the number of illegal foreigners in the state is estimated at 40 lakh to 1 crore
 mahaj ek aankade ne ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf chah saal lambey chale assam andolan ko janm diya tha
 That figure was that in less than a decade, the number of voters in Assam increased by more than 50 percent to reach 85,37,493 in 1979 from 57,01,805 in 1970

" is mudde se nipatane kaa akelaa tarika yah he ki bangladeshiyon ko sansadhano main kisi bhi hisse se vanchit kar diya jaae
 The apprehensions of the original inhabitants gained official legitimacy in the Brahma report, when it was said that illegal Bangladeshi landed on this land 'like an army of robbers armed with dangerous weapons', along with the collusion of corrupt government officials, Due to the instigation of communal political leaders, overnight, most of the land was surrounded by illegal villages

 centre sarkaar ne spasht kiya he ki philhal sabsidi vaale 12alpiji rasoi gas silendaronki sankhya main kami karne kaa uskaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 The government pays 12 LPG gas cylinder subsidy per family annually
 saath hi sarkaar abhi deshbhar main nakad sabsidi yojana par kaam kar rahi he or ise june tak puraa karnaa chaahati he
 Under this, subsidies will be deposited directly in the accounts of consumers
 petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhanne ek intervyuu main ye baaten kahi
 He said, 'actually there is no proposal to cut subsidized LPG quota (per household)
 ’ narendra modi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne agast mencebsidi vaale 14
 Freedom to take 2 kg 12 cylinders at any time of the year whereas in the first month only one subsidized cylinder could be taken
 pradhan ne kaha ki mantrimandal ne pichley shanivaar ko sabsidiukt alpiji ke liye uske maujuuda mulya tathaa vaastavik bazaar bhav main antar ke baraabar nakad sabsidi sidhe upabhokta ke bank khate main daalane ke liye diarect belifits transfar skim ko sudhaar ke saath jari kiya
 In the new scheme, it is not mandatory to have an Aadhaar card to take cash subsidy like the scheme launched in the previous government
 philhal sanshodhit diarect benifits transfar skim (debiti) ko 54 jilon main shuru kiya ja rahaa he or ek janvari se ise desh ke sabhi shesh jilon main lagu kiya jayega
 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, "we expect that in three months it will expand to all districts and during the next three months most customers will be included in it
" at: aap kah sakate hai ki june tak bahusankhyak alpiji upabhokta iske daayre main honge
 LPG consumers who open accounts under 'jan Dhan Yojana' will also benefit from the revised scheme
 is yojana ke tahat ab tak 6 karod se adhik khate khole gayi hai or saal ke ant tak 4 karod or khate kholane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 The scheme aims to have at least one bank account per household
 philhal alpiji upabhoktaaon ke bank khaaton ko unke rasoi gas sankhya se joda ja rahaa he
 Once this is done, the cash subsidy can be sent directly to the bank accounts so that the consumer can buy the LPG cylinder at the market rate
 upabhoktaaon ko salbhar main 12 silendar sabsidi par milte hai
 a subsidized cylinder in Delhi costs Rs 414
 atirikt silendar bazaar mulya 880 rupee main milegaa
 The Petroleum Minister said that the Modi government is working for the interests of the poor and at the same time it will also facilitate doing business in the country
 unhone kaha, ‘sudhaar or garib samarthak hona virodhabhasi nahin he
 Being a poor supporter does not mean that the car of reform will not move forward
 ’purv upie sarkaar ne alpiji ke liye debiti ko aadhaar sankhya se joda tha
 But there were legal issues including some court orders
 adaalat ke aadesh se yojana ke is rup se kriyanvayan par roak lagaai gai he
 That is why the new government decided that in addition to Aadhaar, people who have bank accounts will get LPG subsidy directly in their account
 petroleum mantri ne kaha ki yojana ko mishan mod main kriyanvit kiya jayega
 There will be no customers who will be denied LPG for not having an Aadhaar number
 pradhan ne kaha ki sarkaar debiti ke tahat di jane vaali sabsidi raashi tay karne par kaam kar rahi he

 yah ek jaisaa jarur sunai detaa he
 But there is not one and it is very far to see the past yesterday from today's lens
 ek naam se kuch fark nahin padaa
 Ashoka is also a violent name, similarly Alexander is also a similar name

 It was being said that this absence would be overshadowed by New Delhi and India would be isolated
 china main bharat ke purv rajanyik ashok kanth yaad karte hue bataate hai, ‘‘hamaari apni kuch chintaaen thim jise jaahir karne ke baad hamane is forum se khud ko alag kar liya
 Then some people believed that by separating ourselves from this global project with support from 60 countries, we will be sidelined
 ’’beijing forum ke ek saal baad biarai par bharat kaa rukh sahi sabit ho rahaa he
 Last May, in its statement, New Delhi had expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and financial stability in this mega project
 kanth ke mutabik, ‘‘ab duusari jagahon se bhi aisi awaajen uthne lagi hai
 Sri Lanka, one of the early supporters of the BRI, has now incurred more than $ 8 billion in China's debt

 On July 22, a Wall Street Journal report showed that Chinese power companies were guaranteed a 34 percent annual return on their investment from CPEC projects
 vah bhi tab, jab pakistan aarthik diwaaliyepan ke kagaar par khadaa he
 It is believed that the new government will be forced to take refuge in the IMF (this may put a halt to new CPEC projects)
 in ghatnaon ne biarai ko lekar bharat ke shuruaati andeh ko sahi sabit kiya he
 Kanth, posted at the Chinese embassy until January 2016 (beijing first approached India to formally join the BRI in 2015), said that India had then stated that there was a 'lack of clarity' about the project
 Is the main concern of India
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne 2015 main apane chini samakaksh wang yi ke saamne apana rukh jaahir karte hue kaha tha, ‘‘ham samajhate hai ki yah ek chini pahal thi—na ki ek bahupaksheeya pahal—or hamen samay se isko lekar puri jaankaree vistaar se nahin muhaiyaa kii gai thi’’ isliye bharat ke man main is yojana ko lekar gahare andeh ubhar rahe hai
 That is why India did not participate in joining China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank next year
 beijing ne pehali baar ise biarai se jude project ke rup main pesh kiya tab bharat ne bank ke adhyaksh jin likun ko spasht kar diya tha ki bharat isamen keval tabhi shaamil hoga jab yah pariyojna vastav main ek bahupaksheeya pariyojna jaisi dikhegi
 China has accepted India's stance after its initial rhetoric and stopped its efforts to pressure New Delhi to join India in the BRI
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bharat kii chindthaayen china kii ranneetik mahatvakankshaon ko lekar hai jise china biarai kii aad main aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 Demand for the resignation of Shanti Bhushan has started coming from the joint committee set up to draft the Badalokpal Bill after a new controversy comes to light
 congress or samaajawaadee party ne shanti bhushan tathaa unke putr jayant ko aavantit farmahouson par sawaal uthaaye hai
 These parties have said that Shanti Bhushan should withdraw from the joint committee
 yah vivaad akhabaaron main aaj prakashit hui in khabaron ke baad uthaa he ki pita-putr ko uttar pradesh sarkaar ne varsh 2009 main 10 hajaar varg meter kshetra vaale bhukhand aavantit kiye the
 The value of each plot is three and a half crores
 ek akhbaar ke anusaar, shanti bhushan or jayant bhushan ne swayan mana he ki yojana main paardarshita nahin thi or bina kisi spasht maandand ke aavanton kiya gaya
 Jayant, who has appeared in court against the Uttar Pradesh government in a case related to the installation of statues in a park in Noida, also admitted that the allocation was arbitrary but there was no question of conflict of interest
 is vivaad par pratikriya dete hue shanti bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki in aaropon ke peeche kuch ‘bhrasht or mahatvapurn netaa’ hai
 These allegations have been made because if he continues as a co-chairman in the Joint Committee then it will not be possible for the leaders to get a 'light' draft of the Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki unhone apane tathaa jayant ke liye bhukhand aavantit karaane main kisi tarah kaa pakshpaat karne ko nahin kaha tha or na hi vivekadhin cote ke tahat aavanton maanga tha
 Shanti Bhushan said, 'public applications were sought

 'he said,' (if i remain in the committee), they will be forced to enact a strict anti-corruption bill

 Guinness World Records officially recognized Kane Tanaka's name during an event on Saturday
 kaarykram kaa aayojan dakshin pashchim japan ke fakuoka main ek nursing home main kiya gaya tha, jahaan philhal wo rahati hai
 His family was accompanied by the mayor to celebrate the celebration
 bataa den ki tanaaka kaa janm do janvari, 1903 main hua tha or wo apane maa-baap ke aath bacchon main se saatven number kii santan hai
 He married Hideo Tanaka in 1922 and has four children
 saath hi unhone apni bahan ke ek bachche ko god bhi liya tha
 Prior to Kane Tanaka, the title of oldest living person was in the name of another Japanese woman, Chiyo Miyako, who died at the age of 117 on July 22, 2018
 kaane tanaaka aaj bhi subah 6 baje uth jaati hai or raat 9 baje tak so jaati hai
 Tanake is fond of mathematics and Othello, a famous character in William Shakespeare's novel

 In the record so far, Jiromon Kimura of Japan has won the title of the man who has been alive for the most days
 bataa de ki koi bhi ab tak unka ye record tod nahin paaya he
 Thanks to the unpredictable US President Donald Trump and the outspoken President of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, he has provided an opportunity for the world to breathe peacefully, otherwise the 'world two days' news channels And programs like '10 Seconds in Mahapralaya 'left no stone unturned to push people towards Mahavairagya

 or isi kaaran12june, 2018kaa din duniya ke itihaas main tab tak ke liye darj ho gaya,jab tak duniya maujuud rahegi
 With this, the letters of the names of these two leaders were also forever inscribed on the back of time
 bas,yahi itihaas he,or itihaas main naam darj ho janaa hi he - amarta
 The philosopher Fukuyama called immortality a 'whisper of memories'
 sharir ko to nasht hona hi hona he
 Immortality can only be achieved by preserving oneself in future memories, and history is an accumulated corpus of memories of its time
 bhala koun is kosh kaa hissaa bananaa nahin chahega
 When we look at the politics of the country and the world through this spectacle, then we find out why the field of politics is so much more aggressive, more than any other region of the world; Even more than trade-wise
 haalanki jivan ke har kshetra kaa apana-apana itihaas hota he,lekin itihaas naamak vishay kaa centre to raajnneeti hi he
 Therefore, it does not seem so unnatural that a very big businessman of the world should think of becoming the surveyor of the most powerful country in the world and the right of a small country to be a small man; The ruler should create fear in the whole world to maintain his power
 sikandar ke'vishwavijeta'banane ke sapane ke mul main kahin na kahin itihaas kaa pehla panna banane kii khwaahish hi kaam kar rahi thi
 i am not only a student of history, but also a lover of history
 mere saamne itihaas ke spashtatah do rup hai
 One, which i have come to know only by reading in the book of history, and the other is that piece of history; That which has passed before my eyes, and i am reading that and to some extent, i have been reading the history of food
 pichley maheene jab main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ke itihaas ke bare main pard rahaa tha,to mujhe aisa lag rahaa tha ki main apane dekhe hue daur kaa ek baar phir saakshaatkaar kar rahaa hum
 The joy of reading it was amazing
 main sochataa hum ki itihaas ko maatr ek tatasth darshak hone par yadi itihaas mujhe itnaa anand de saktaa he,kisi satya-upanyaas kaa anand,to jo itihaas ko bana rahe hai,unhen kitna adhik anand miltaa hoga
 Their enjoyment is hardly imaginable
 kahin aisa to nahin ki is acolpaneey anand kii kalpana hi akshay urja kaa strot banakar raajnneetigyon ko iske liye kuch bhi kar guzarane ke liye lagaataar uksaati rahati he
 i believe that reading history cannot be a creative work
 itihaas ko padhaane main bhi koi creativity nahin he,lekin itihaas ko banane main to he
 In this way, can politics not be called a creative activity in the field of history and happiness derived from these activities is a creative pleasure
 is par vichaar kiya janaa chahie

 The issue of indiscipline has once again come to the Israeli military through social networking sites
 is baar mahila sainikon ke ek group ne sirf undervier pahane or haathon main kuch hathiyaar lekar photo khinchavai or use fasebuk par aplod kar diya

 After these incidents, the Israeli army banned the use of social media sites while staying in the base of the soldiers, so as to avoid the hassle of such posts
 haalanki yah saaf nahin he ki abhi bhi yah pratibandh kaayam he yaa nahin
 Earlier this year, another soldier received severe rebuke from the military for tweeting anti-palestinian tweets and uploading nude photographs with guns to other social media sites

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal khud ko karpshan ke khilaaf muhim kaa king bataane kaa koi mauka nahin chookte
 But this time, his own brothers-in-law are seen getting caught in the corruption case
 dilli police kii aarthik aparaadh shakha ne surendra kumaar bansal ke khilaaf praarambhik jaanch ke aadesh diye hai
 An NGO named Road Anti Corruption Organization had filed a complaint against Bansal
 jaanch adhikari ne enjio ko maamle se jude dastavej pesh karne ke liye kaha he
 What is the matter? The NGO has alleged that Kejriwal gave his brother-in-law Surender Kumar Bansal government work for several construction works between 2014 and 2016
 jinamein kai dami company banaakar karodo kaa kaam dikhaaya gaya or phir kaagajon par hi kaam dikhalaakar paise hadap liye gaye
 NGO founder Rahul Sharma and ngo-associated Viplav Awasthi say Kejriwal did all this to benefit his relative
 unka kahana he ki hamaari ore se 150 se zyada artiai daali gayi lekin sambandhit vibhaagon se koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 Kejriwal's brother-in-law formed a company under the name Renu Construction and then showed him buying goods from Mahadev Impex
 jabaki mahadev impex ne cell tex vibhaag ko di jaankaree main dikhaaya he ki company ne naa to koi kaarobaar kiya, naa hi kisi se maal liya or naa hi kisi ko aage maal bechaa he
 That is, the work from drains to construction was done only on paper and the money was given from the government funds
 enjio ne kejariwal sarkaar par niyamon main gadabadi kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 The NGO says that they have scams of around 8 crores which are the names of Surender Kumar Bansal's company
 hamane ACB ko bhi maamle se judi shikaayat saunp di he
 In response to the allegations of these allegations to Arvind Kejriwal, the NGO said that how can one expect a fair investigation and justice from those who have distributed revolutions to their relatives

 ayappa ke kai bhakt is faisle ke khilaaf sadakon par utar aae hai
 The special thing is that the biggest party of the country has stood with the BJP devotees
 isedakshin bharatmen pair jamaane kii party kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he kyonki ayappa ke bhakt sirf kerala main hi nahin balki puure dakshin bharat main faile hue hai or bijepi 2019 se pehle south main apana base badhaane ke liye ji-jaan se juty he
 The land of Kerala once again remains the political arena of the left-right

 Women's organizations have planned to enter it
 kerala kii vampanthi sarkaar isaki vyavastha banane main juty he

 darasal, desh kii satta par kabiz hone ke baad se bijepi kaa sabase bada lakshya tripura, pashchim bengal or kerala main camel khilaane kaa he
 These states are not only politically important for her, but she also wants to establish her base in these states due to ideological enmity with the Left
 tripura main use kamyaabi mil gai he
 The Supreme Court's decision on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala has given her a big chance
 hindu maton ke liye lard rahe left-rhitakerala main vampanthi partiyon kaa aadhaar hindu voter hai, to vahiin congress kaa isai or muslim matadaataaon main acha aadhaar he
 BJP has not been able to make a political place in Kerala yet

 bjp's Rajagopal won Nemom, one of the 140 assembly seats in Kerala
 kerala kii kuch siten aisi bhi raheen jahaan bijepi duusare sthaan par rahi
 This leads to uneasiness in the Left alliance
 kerala kaa saamaajik tanabanakerala ke saamaajik halaat desh ke baaki hisson se ekadam alag hai
 Hindus constitute around 52% of the population in Kerala
 iske alaava 27 fisadi muslim or 18 fisadi isai aabaadi he
 The main political contest in Kerala is between the Left and the Congress alliance
 aise main bijepi ke netritv vaala endie apane ko majboot karne kii koshish main juta he
 Out of 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala's BJP Yeh Hai Gadhrajya, in 2014, BJP contested 18 and gave the remaining 2 seats to its allies

 However, stringent monitoring measures have been proposed, in which the company will have to make its accounts available to the government for examination

 In addition, the government will also have the exclusive right (veto power) to accept or reject the agent offered by a company at any time

 The government has taken this step to ensure transparency in the dark world of defense deals
 haalanki purv dipipi main bhi videshi companiyon ke liye agent niyukt karne kii suvidha thi lekin pehali baar borevar disha nirdesh jari kiye gaye hai
 The previous system failed to ensure transparency, although defense agents continued to play a key role in defense deals

 iske saath hi sarkaar ko kisi company dwaara prastaavit agent ko kisi bhi samay sweekaar yaa asweekaar karne kaa vishesh adhikaar (vito power) bhi hoga

 Speaking about the incidents of communal violence in Bihar in the last few days, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has said that governance in the Nitish Kumar government has completely reduced to zero and has become a riot hero
