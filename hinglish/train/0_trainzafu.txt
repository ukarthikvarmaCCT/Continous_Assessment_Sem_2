 It is being talked about Swami Agnivesh, who is going to be a guest in Bigg Boss after being away from Anna
 kaltak desh kii mushkilon ko sulajhane vaale swami agnivesh ko bulaava aayaa he big bos ke ghar se jise swami agnivesh ne manjuur kar liya he
 The news is absolutely confirmed
 big bos ke ghar main mehmaan banane ja rahe hai swami agnivesh
 He was Swami Agnivesh, who still used to speak on religion
 lekin ab wo ek aise ghar ke mehmaan banenge jahaan hoti he, har roj nura kushti
 In Bigg Boss, Swami will talk, talk to people on other issues, Agnivesh will talk on serious issues
 agnivesh ke ek sahyogi ke mutabik swami agnivesh ne big bos sijan-5 main janaa tay kar liya he
 In Big Boss, Agnivesh will teach everyone to speak on issues other than minor quarrels
 swami agnivesh ne big bos main mehmaan banakar jane ko chalange ke taur par liya he
 Now it has to be seen whether Swami Agnivesh will really be able to show his awesomeness in Bigg Boss season-5 or not
 vaise big bos apane jhagadon ke liye mashhoor he
 It may be a minor matter, but a quarrel occurs - like a storm is about to come
 dekhnaa hoga ki swami agnivesh is jhagade or klesh par kaise viraam lagaate hai
 There is a gathering of beauties in Big Boss
 pratiyogita jeetne ke liye har hasina sabhi hadein paar karne main juty hai
 Ranging from quarreling to screaming
 big bos main gaali-galouj aam baat he
 Swami Agnivesh is reaching among them all
 to kya swami agnivesh ko ghar main shanti ke liye bulaayaa gaya he
 By the way, if you see the history of Bigg Boss, every person in the house has been associated with some dispute
 phir swami agnivesh bhi to vivaadon main ghire rahe hai

 In West Bengal, people boycotted a Hindu family simply because they buried the family member's body rather than cremating it
 maamla uttar 24 pargana jile main bharat-bangladesh seemaa ke paas harishpur gaanv kaa he

 To fulfill his mother's last wish, he buried her body in the courtyard of the house

 The government said, 'the villagers told me that because i buried my mother, it would not be considered a valid funeral under Hindu custom

 But still they decided to boycott us

 The relatives of the Bidesh government and his neighbor Nakul Chandra Sen supported him, while the villagers boycotted him as well
 matua samaaj main 'samadhi' kii paramparabidesh ke pita kalipaada sarkaar ne bataaya ki matua rivaajon ke mutabik logon ko dafnaaya bhi ja saktaa he or use 'samadhi' kaha jaataa he
 He said, 'the villagers came and asked why we had buried them

 islam ne kaha, 'samvidhan ne ham sabhi ko kuch moolbhoot adhikaar die hai
 The villagers have no right to decide what facilities should and should not be provided to the family
 'tus se mas nahin gaanvvalehalanki gaanvvaale samajhane ko taiyaar nahin hai or unka kahana he ki baar-baar chetavanee ke baavjood sarkaar ne sanathan hindu dharm kaa apmaan kiya he
 Subhash Mandal, who lives in the village, said, 'he did not follow Hindu customs and said that he does not believe in the Gita and Mahabharata
 hamen majaburi main unke khilaaf ye karrwai kerani padi
 After the death of Sarkar's mother, the villagers who came to his house to mourn, opposed the decision of burial
 jab sarkaar ne unki baat nahin maani to gaanvvaalon ne bhi antim sanskaar main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya
 With the help of some relatives and neighbor Nakula Chandra Sen, the government buried her mother in the courtyard of the house

 is aalekh kaa naam he friday flashbek
 Flashback is the name of the situation in the hero when the hero stands in the present but his eyes start to fade such that he slowly drifts into the past
 jab vah baccha hota he, yaa kishor hota he yaa phir jail jane se pehle vah kitna acha hota he
 Many such scenes of the past are shown as flashbacks in Hindi films
 kai baar itane lambey hote the ki flashbek main hi pehla half nikal jaataa he
 As soon as the hero or heroine return with flashback, one of the two looks at the narrowed side and one of them starts moving in the other direction with a sharp turn
 phir kahani vahaan se aage badhati he lekin tabhi interval ho jaataa he
 the name of Ram is the truth
 
 
 ram kaa naam tab bhi satya tha ab bhi satya he magar jo saal tha tab bhi jhooth tha ab bhi jhooth he
 It was the year of 2013
 ajeeb saal tha vah
 Like a ghost comes out of the crematorium
 silendar kii arathi nikali thi
 The price was around 600
 ab usee silendar kaa daam 833 rupaya ho chukaa he, magar shavyatra nikaalane vaale gaayab hai
 Actually, they have understood the meaning of Arathi
 wo jaanate hai ki raajnneeti juthi he, ram kaa naam satya he
 Think 600 was the price when these people took off the shirt, Manmohan Singh was doing hi
 ab jab silendar 800 se adhik kaa he, inaki kameez kahaan par he, patalun kahaan par he, ham nahin jaanate hai
 If you see them, let me know
 friday flash back main ham un dinon kii taraf aapako le chalenge jab petrol deazal ke daam badha karte the or tab kya zordaar pradarshan hua karata tha
 Today many people are searching for the opposition which used to increase the number of demonstrations when the oil price went up
 yahi bahut se log aaj ke vipaksh main us vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai jo 2014 ke pehle pradarshan karata tha
 Asking, "O today's opposition, why are you not like yesterday's opposition?" tumhen kya ho gaya he
 The same globe, the same globalization, but such a different picture of the price of oil
 aisa kyon he bhai
 This moped was handed over to the flames
 mahangaai ke virodh ke itihaas kaa vah gumnaam nayak he jo apane isurance hone yaa na hone kii vyathaa bhi na kah sakaa
 The bus that was burnt must have been confident that let it go burning, diesel would never be expensive again due to my burning
 ye insaan kitne kudagarz hai
 They are not self-centered, their goal is clear
 dhuen kii taap se isliye peeche hat gaye kyonki inhen pataa he ki ham tair jalaane aae hai, jalane nahin
 Please remember the sacrifice of mopeds, buses and tires
 kabhi forget mat kariye
 Hui backed away
 ye jalaane aae the, jalane nahin
 These political opponents of inflation were going in front of Rajdhani Express
 train ko pataa tha ki is vakt express ye log hai, wo nahin
 In Flashback Friday, we remember the years of 2010, 12 and 13, when the opposition did not tolerate the rise in prices of petrol and diesel
 tab jab daam 74 rupee litre tha ravishankar prasad cycle se chale the, ab jab 80 rupee he ve cycle se nahin chal rahe hai
 Rameshwar Chaurasia of BJP had done the cycle work, took the handle for the camera, but now he will not make any difference from Rs 80 or 89 per liter of petrol
 ye karnataka ke mukhyamantri hai sadanand gauda, tab the ab nahin hai, cycle chalaa rahe hai
 Today, when petrol is historically expensive, it is expected that their bicycle will still be useful
 hamane kuch logon se poocha ki kya aap petrol ke daam ke khilaaf 2012-13 ke pradarshnon ko miss kar rahe hai
 If you're missing out, check out Flashback Friday
 bharat kii raajnneeti ke kuch mul katarvy hai
 Do not tolerate inflation, even if the price is not low, but keep opposing
 librari main mahangaai kaa virodh karte hue bijepi netaaon ke khub video hai
 At that time when petrol price was 74 rupees then history is witness that BJP leaders have not done any laziness in demonstrating
 un pradarshnon main jitne netaa shaamil the, unamem se kai mantri ban gaye
 In the visual of the old performance, no one can say that Sushma Swaraj is not a Sirius
 videsh mantri ke chehre kaa purana gussa bataa rahaa he ki wo mahangaai ko lekar kitni sirius rahati hongi
 Hopefully she will still be Sirius today
 unke pradarshan main sar par silendar laade ye mahilaayein chali aa rahi hai
 The media cameras should see that the price of the cylinder has increased so these people are sitting in Sushma ji's meeting
 aaj bina sabsidi vaala silendar 833 rupee kaa he
 In September 2012, the non-subsidized cylinder became Rs 750
 rasoi main kinare rakhe silendar ko ghar ghar se khinch kar sadakon par laayaa gaya tha
 Whenever there was a demonstration, there was a cylinder
 petrol or deazal belgaum ho chukaa he
 When the new government came, the price of crude oil in the international market fell from $ 115 per barrel to $ 45-50 per barrel
 phir bhi keemton main koi kami nahin hui
 People stopped understanding that petrol is Rs 74 at $ 115 per barrel, so why is oil at Rs 70 per liter at $ 46 per barrel
 ab unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kachche tel kii keemat to sirf 75 se 80 dollar prati bairal he phir petrol 89 rupee prati litre kaise ho gaya
 While the price of crude oil per barrel is not even $ 115
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne us vakt ek pradarshan main arthshaastra kaa formula bataaya tha
 Now Jaitley is the Finance Minister
 kehete hai ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 They do not say, but write blogs
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan to manmohan singh ke samay bhi thi
 But one thing has to be heard petrol ke daam bhale hi aitihaasik rup se sabase zyada ho gaye hai magar petrol pump se sarkaar dur nahin gai he
 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year
 kya left kya rhite sab usamen shaamil the
 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu
 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road
 ram naam satya he
 
 
 Ram's name was still true, but it is still true, but the year it was still a lie is still a lie
 wo 2013 kaa saal tha
 It was a strange year
 kisi bhoot kii tarah shmashaan se nikal aata he
 The cylinder was cast
 daam 600 ke aas paas tha
 Now the cost of the same cylinder has been Rs 833, but the funeral processors are missing
 darasal wo arathi kaa arth samaj chuke hai
 They know that politics is false, Ram's name is true
 sochie 600 daam hua tha tab in logon ne kameez utaar di thi, manmohan singh hai hai kar rahe the
 Now that the cylinder is more than 800, where is his shirt, where is the trouser, we do not know
 agar ye aapako dikhen to mujhe bataaiyegaa
 In the Friday flashback, we will take you to the days when petrol used to increase diesel prices and then there was a strong performance
 aaj bahut se log us vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai jo tel ke daam badhane par pradarshnon kii sankhya badha detaa tha
 This is what many people are looking for in today's opposition that performed before 2014
 puch rahe ki he aaj ke vipaksh tum kal ke vipaksh kii tarah kyon nahin ho
 What has happened to you vahi globe, vahi globalizeshan magar tel ke daam ko lekar itnaa alag-alag pikcharizeshan
 Why is it so brother

 He is the unsung hero of the history of protest against inflation, who could not even tell the agony of having or not having his insurance
 jala di gai bas ko yah bharosa rahaa hoga ki jal jane do sakhi, gar mere jalane se deazal phir kabhi mahangaa na hoga
 These people are so self-righteous

 Moved from the heat of smoke because they know that we have come to burn tires, not to burn

 Never Forget
 hui peeche hat gaye
 They came to burn, not to burn
 mahangaai ke ye raajnneetik virdohi rajdhani express ke saamne hi chale ja rahe the
 The train knew that these people are the expresses at this time, they are not
 flashbek friday main ham yaad kar rahe hai 2010, 12 or 13 ke saal ko jab petrol or deazal ke daam badhate hi vipaksh bardaasht nahin karata tha
 Then when the price was 74 rupees a liter, Ravi Shankar Prasad used to go by bicycle, now when he is 80 rupees he is not cycling
 bijepi ke hi rameshwar chaurasia ne cycle kii sadhana kar lee thi, camere ke liye handle sambhaal liya magar ab inhen 80 yaa 89 rupee prati litre petrol se koi fark nahin padataa hoga
 He is the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sadanand Gowda, when he is no longer, is cycling
 aaj jab petrol aitihaasik rup se mahangaa he ummid he unki wo vaali cycle abhi kaam main aati hogi
 We asked some people whether you are missing the 2012-13 protests against petrol prices
 agar aap miss kar rahe hai to flashbek friday zarur dekhie
 There are some basic duties of India's politics
 mahangaai ko bardaasht nahin karnaa he, bhale daam kam na ho lekin virodh karte rahanaa he
 There are many videos of BJP leaders protesting inflation in the library
 us samay jab petrol ke daam 74 rupee hote the to itihaas gavaah he ki bijepi ke netaaon ne pradarshan karne main koi aalasy nahin kiya he
 Many of the leaders involved in those demonstrations became ministers
 puraane pradarshan ke vijual main koi nahin kah saktaa ki sushamaa swaraj sirius nahin hai
 The old anger of the foreign minister's face is telling how much Sirius will be living on inflation
 ummid kerani chahie wo aaj bhi sirius hongi
 In their performance, these women are carrying the cylinder on the head
 media ke camaron ko thik se dikhe ki silendar kaa hi daam badha he isliye sar par silendar laade ye log sushamaa ji kii sabha main baithi hai
 Today, the subsidized cylinder is 833 rupees
 sitambar 2012 main bina sabsidi vaala silendar 750 rupaya kaa ho gaya tha
 The cylinders placed sideways in the kitchen were pulled from house to house on the streets
 jab bhi pradarshan hota tha koi na koi silendar liye chalaa aata tha
 Petrol and diesel have been run out
 nai sarkaar ai to antarashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar prati bairal se ghat kar 45-50 dollar prati bairal par aa gai
 Still there was no reduction in prices
 logon ne samajhnaa band kar diya ki 115 dollar prati bairal par petrol 74 rupee he to 46 dollars prati bairal par tel 70 rupee prati litre kyon he
 Now they do not understand that the price of crude oil is only 75 to 80 dollars per barrel, then how did petrol become 89 rupees per liter
 jabaki prati bairal kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar bhi nahin hui he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had told the economics formula in a demonstration at that time
 ab vahi jetali vitt mantri hai
 It is said that this has happened due to international circumstances
 kehete nahin balki blog likhte hai
 The international situation was also during the time of Manmohan Singh
 par ek baat kii daad deni hogi
 Although petrol prices have historically been the highest, but the government has not moved away from petrol pumps
 aap kisi bhi petrol pump par jaaiye, jaise hi tel bharaa kar niklenge, saamne pradhanmantri mil jaaenge
 There is no pump where the Prime Minister's poster is not present
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji sab dekh hi rahe hai to tel ke daam kaa kya virodh karnaa
 Let's fill it and leave quietly
 daam badhane se gas kaa phayda kam nahin ho jaataa
 If you watch this Prime Minister's poster carefully, you will understand
 gas kaa kharchaa roj kaa 10-15 rupaya kaa he
 450 of the month
 ye zaruri he ki 833 rupee waalon kaa hisaab is poster par nahin he
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he

 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter

 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees

 This moped was handed over to the flames
 mahangaai ke virodh ke itihaas kaa vah gumnaam nayak he jo apane isurance hone yaa na hone kii vyathaa bhi na kah sakaa
 The bus that was burnt must have been confident that let it go burning, diesel would never be expensive again due to my burning
 ye insaan kitne kudagarz hai
 They are not self-centered, their goal is clear
 dhuen kii taap se isliye peeche hat gaye kyonki inhen pataa he ki ham tair jalaane aae hai, jalane nahin
 Please remember the sacrifice of mopeds, buses and tires
 kabhi forget mat kariye
 Hui backed away
 ye jalaane aae the, jalane nahin
 These political opponents of inflation were going in front of Rajdhani Express
 train ko pataa tha ki is vakt express ye log hai, wo nahin
 In Flashback Friday, we remember the years of 2010, 12 and 13, when the opposition did not tolerate the rise in prices of petrol and diesel
 tab jab daam 74 rupee litre tha ravishankar prasad cycle se chale the, ab jab 80 rupee he ve cycle se nahin chal rahe hai
 Rameshwar Chaurasia of BJP had done the cycle work, took the handle for the camera, but now he will not make any difference from Rs 80 or 89 per liter of petrol
 ye karnataka ke mukhyamantri hai sadanand gauda, tab the ab nahin hai, cycle chalaa rahe hai
 Today, when petrol is historically expensive, it is expected that their bicycle will still be useful
 hamane kuch logon se poocha ki kya aap petrol ke daam ke khilaaf 2012-13 ke pradarshnon ko miss kar rahe hai
 If you're missing out, check out Flashback Friday
 bharat kii raajnneeti ke kuch mul katarvy hai
 Do not tolerate inflation, even if the price is not low, but keep opposing
 librari main mahangaai kaa virodh karte hue bijepi netaaon ke khub video hai
 At that time when petrol price was 74 rupees then history is witness that BJP leaders have not done any laziness in demonstrating
 un pradarshnon main jitne netaa shaamil the, unamem se kai mantri ban gaye
 In the visual of the old performance, no one can say that Sushma Swaraj is not a Sirius
 videsh mantri ke chehre kaa purana gussa bataa rahaa he ki wo mahangaai ko lekar kitni sirius rahati hongi
 Hopefully she will still be Sirius today
 unke pradarshan main sar par silendar laade ye mahilaayein chali aa rahi hai
 The media cameras should see that the price of the cylinder has increased so these people are sitting in Sushma ji's meeting
 aaj bina sabsidi vaala silendar 833 rupee kaa he
 In September 2012, the non-subsidized cylinder became Rs 750
 rasoi main kinare rakhe silendar ko ghar ghar se khinch kar sadakon par laayaa gaya tha
 Whenever there was a demonstration, there was a cylinder
 petrol or deazal belgaum ho chukaa he
 When the new government came, the price of crude oil in the international market fell from $ 115 per barrel to $ 45-50 per barrel
 phir bhi keemton main koi kami nahin hui
 People stopped understanding that petrol is Rs 74 at $ 115 per barrel, so why is oil at Rs 70 per liter at $ 46 per barrel
 ab unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kachche tel kii keemat to sirf 75 se 80 dollar prati bairal he phir petrol 89 rupee prati litre kaise ho gaya
 While the price of crude oil per barrel is not even $ 115
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne us vakt ek pradarshan main arthshaastra kaa formula bataaya tha
 Now Jaitley is the Finance Minister
 kehete hai ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 They do not say, but write blogs
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan to manmohan singh ke samay bhi thi
 But one thing has to be heard petrol ke daam bhale hi aitihaasik rup se sabase zyada ho gaye hai magar petrol pump se sarkaar dur nahin gai he
 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year
 kya left kya rhite sab usamen shaamil the
 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu
 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road
 flashbek friday main ham yaad kar rahe hai 2010, 12 or 13 ke saal ko jab petrol or deazal ke daam badhate hi vipaksh bardaasht nahin karata tha
 Then when the price was 74 rupees a liter, Ravi Shankar Prasad used to go by bicycle, now when he is 80 rupees he is not cycling
 bijepi ke hi rameshwar chaurasia ne cycle kii sadhana kar lee thi, camere ke liye handle sambhaal liya magar ab inhen 80 yaa 89 rupee prati litre petrol se koi fark nahin padataa hoga
 He is the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sadanand Gowda, when he is no longer, is cycling
 aaj jab petrol aitihaasik rup se mahangaa he ummid he unki wo vaali cycle abhi kaam main aati hogi
 We asked some people whether you are missing the 2012-13 protests against petrol prices
 agar aap miss kar rahe hai to flashbek friday zarur dekhie
 There are some basic duties of India's politics
 mahangaai ko bardaasht nahin karnaa he, bhale daam kam na ho lekin virodh karte rahanaa he
 There are many videos of BJP leaders protesting inflation in the library
 us samay jab petrol ke daam 74 rupee hote the to itihaas gavaah he ki bijepi ke netaaon ne pradarshan karne main koi aalasy nahin kiya he
 Many of the leaders involved in those demonstrations became ministers
 puraane pradarshan ke vijual main koi nahin kah saktaa ki sushamaa swaraj sirius nahin hai
 The old anger of the foreign minister's face is telling how much Sirius will be living on inflation
 ummid kerani chahie wo aaj bhi sirius hongi
 In their performance, these women are carrying the cylinder on the head
 media ke camaron ko thik se dikhe ki silendar kaa hi daam badha he isliye sar par silendar laade ye log sushamaa ji kii sabha main baithi hai
 Today, the subsidized cylinder is 833 rupees
 sitambar 2012 main bina sabsidi vaala silendar 750 rupaya kaa ho gaya tha
 The cylinders placed sideways in the kitchen were pulled from house to house on the streets
 jab bhi pradarshan hota tha koi na koi silendar liye chalaa aata tha
 Petrol and diesel have been run out
 nai sarkaar ai to antarashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar prati bairal se ghat kar 45-50 dollar prati bairal par aa gai
 Still there was no reduction in prices
 logon ne samajhnaa band kar diya ki 115 dollar prati bairal par petrol 74 rupee he to 46 dollars prati bairal par tel 70 rupee prati litre kyon he
 Now they do not understand that the price of crude oil is only 75 to 80 dollars per barrel, then how did petrol become 89 rupees per liter
 jabaki prati bairal kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar bhi nahin hui he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had told the economics formula in a demonstration at that time
 ab vahi jetali vitt mantri hai
 It is said that this has happened due to international circumstances
 kehete nahin balki blog likhte hai
 The international situation was also during the time of Manmohan Singh
 par ek baat kii daad deni hogi
 Although petrol prices have historically been the highest, but the government has not moved away from petrol pumps
 aap kisi bhi petrol pump par jaaiye, jaise hi tel bharaa kar niklenge, saamne pradhanmantri mil jaaenge
 There is no pump where the Prime Minister's poster is not present
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji sab dekh hi rahe hai to tel ke daam kaa kya virodh karnaa
 Let's fill it and leave quietly
 daam badhane se gas kaa phayda kam nahin ho jaataa
 If you watch this Prime Minister's poster carefully, you will understand
 gas kaa kharchaa roj kaa 10-15 rupaya kaa he
 450 of the month
 ye zaruri he ki 833 rupee waalon kaa hisaab is poster par nahin he
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he
 Vijay Goel
 khud ko bike par set karte hue
 Once the position is set and Goyal's bike convoy moves
 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees
 rupee kii haalat bhi kamazor he
 But that is not what used to happen then
 log badal gaye yaa phir tivi kaa screen badal gaya
 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge

 Hopefully she will still be Sirius today
 unke pradarshan main sar par silendar laade ye mahilaayein chali aa rahi hai
 The media cameras should see that the price of the cylinder has increased so these people are sitting in Sushma ji's meeting
 aaj bina sabsidi vaala silendar 833 rupee kaa he
 In September 2012, the non-subsidized cylinder became Rs 750
 rasoi main kinare rakhe silendar ko ghar ghar se khinch kar sadakon par laayaa gaya tha
 Whenever there was a demonstration, there was a cylinder
 petrol or deazal belgaum ho chukaa he
 When the new government came, the price of crude oil in the international market fell from $ 115 per barrel to $ 45-50 per barrel
 phir bhi keemton main koi kami nahin hui
 People stopped understanding that petrol is Rs 74 at $ 115 per barrel, so why is oil at Rs 70 per liter at $ 46 per barrel
 ab unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kachche tel kii keemat to sirf 75 se 80 dollar prati bairal he phir petrol 89 rupee prati litre kaise ho gaya
 While the price of crude oil per barrel is not even $ 115
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne us vakt ek pradarshan main arthshaastra kaa formula bataaya tha
 Now Jaitley is the Finance Minister
 kehete hai ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 They do not say, but write blogs
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan to manmohan singh ke samay bhi thi
 But one thing has to be heard petrol ke daam bhale hi aitihaasik rup se sabase zyada ho gaye hai magar petrol pump se sarkaar dur nahin gai he
 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year

 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out

 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart

 The public was still the same, the public is still the same

 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition

 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices

 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak

 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go

 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road
 aap kisi bhi petrol pump par jaaiye, jaise hi tel bharaa kar niklenge, saamne pradhanmantri mil jaaenge
 There is no pump where the Prime Minister's poster is not present
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji sab dekh hi rahe hai to tel ke daam kaa kya virodh karnaa
 Let's fill it and leave quietly
 daam badhane se gas kaa phayda kam nahin ho jaataa
 If you watch this Prime Minister's poster carefully, you will understand
 gas kaa kharchaa roj kaa 10-15 rupaya kaa he
 450 of the month
 ye zaruri he ki 833 rupee waalon kaa hisaab is poster par nahin he
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he
 Vijay Goel
 khud ko bike par set karte hue
 Once the position is set and Goyal's bike convoy moves
 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees
 rupee kii haalat bhi kamazor he
 But that is not what used to happen then
 log badal gaye yaa phir tivi kaa screen badal gaya
 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation

 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it

 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets

 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he

 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go , our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees
 rupee kii haalat bhi kamazor he
 But that is not what used to happen then
 log badal gaye yaa phir tivi kaa screen badal gaya
 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he

 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu
 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road

 Even though Singh was arrested in an old case on Wednesday, a challenge posed to Nitish Kumar over the disclosure of Singh's alleged involvement in the kidnapping of four persons in the flood block of Patna district on 17 June by Patna's outgoing SSP Jitendra Rana
 It has happened, because JDU ally RJD has demanded Singh's arrest
 argedy pravaktaa mundrika singh yadav ne samvaadadaataaon ko baad main bataaya ki party baadh maamle main singh kii giraftaar kii maang karti he
 In this case Putush Yadav was killed
 party pramukh lalu prasad ne bhi spasht kiya he ki sarkaar ko kanoon ko uskaa kaam karne dena chahie
 Lalu said the case was an ordeal for Patna's new SSP Vikas Vaibhav as he was in the NIA before coming to the state
 duusari baar vidhayak bane anant singh patna jile ke baadh ilaake main kathith rup se samanaantar prashasan chalaane ke kaaran ‘‘chote sarkaar’’ ke naam se jane jate hai

 un par purv main media ke ek vyakti ko bandhak banane evam usase marpet karne tathaa patna nagar nigam ke adeshon kaa ulanghan karne ke aarope lag chuke hai
 The municipal corporation ordered the demolition of two floors of their goods in the middle of the city
 nitish kumaar ke saath satta sangharsh ke charam daur main purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne anant singh par unhen nitish se baghawat karne par thappad maarane kii dhamkee di thi
 The RJD took a tough stance on his alleged involvement in the flood abduction and murder case, prompting the Nitish Kumar government to take prompt action against him

 Mundrika Singh Yadav, who visited the floods on Tuesday along with an RJD spokesperson and a party from the party, told reporters that the families and locals of the victims have confirmed the mla's "involvement"
 unhone maamle main vidhayak kaa naam shaamil karne tathaa unki fouran giraftaar kii maang kii
 He also demanded that Jitendra Rana be kept in Patna until the investigation of the case is complete
 rana ne esaspi patna kaa pad tyaagane se kuch pehle hi samvaadadaataaon ke samaksh yah khulaasa kiya he
 He has been transferred to Motihari and replaced by Vikas Vaibhav
 jediu ke rajya pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki rana ke tabadale kaa maamle se kuch lenaa dena nahin he tathaa unhone daawa kiya ki kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Bihar Congress President Ashok Chaudhary said that Nitish Kumar has always said that no one will be discriminated against and the party is confident that the law will do its job even in the current case
 tippaniyan Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that Nitish Kumar transferred Patna SSP Jitendra Rana to save Anant Singh, which proves that he wants to establish a state of terror in the state
 susheel modi ne ek bayaan main anant singh ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa vishwast aadmi bataaya or aarope lagaaya ki vah mukhyamantri kii reliyon ke liye bheed jutata he

 bhartiya telecom market main reliance jeeyo kii 4ji entry ne airtel samet sabhi telecom diggajon ko kadi chunauti di
 In view of this challenge, where Vodafone and Idea, ranked second and third, moved in the direction of merger, now Airtel has taken the initiative to take foreign debt of about Rs 7000 crore to meet the challenge of Reliance in 4G network
 is
 sutron ke mutabik sunil mittal kii kaman main airtel ne global investment bankers se ek se do maheene ke andar 1 arab dollar (6,900 karod rupee) kaa karj lene ke liye baatcheet shuru kar di he
 Sources claim that during the month of August, Airtel may be able to take a loan to repair its 4G network
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya telecom market main reliance jeeyo kii entry ke baad shuru hue is yuddh main 5-6 investment bankerertel ko karjdene kaa faisla le sakate hai
 In addition, Vodafone and Idea may resort to foreign debt to strengthen their network, along with the merger, to consolidate their claim between this arrogance
 khaas baat he ki airtel or vodaphone-idia se milane vaali is chunauti ke liye reliance jeeyo bhi apane khajaane ko majboot karne kii taiyaari main juta he
 Recently after collecting Rs 2,500 crore through domestic corporate bonds, Reliance Jio took an initiative to raise Rs 6,800 crore in the Korean credit market
 iske alaava jeeyo ne haal hi main japan ke bainkon se sindicated samurai lone ke tahat 50 karod dollar ekatra kiye the
 It is worth noting that due to the challenge being faced by Reliance Jio in 4G network, Airtel has planned to invest Rs 24,000 crore by March 2019
 khaas baat yah he ki is rakam ko jutaney se pehle is saal march tak airtel par 95,000 karod kaa karj tha
 Airtel had a debt of Rs 91,000 crore a year ago
 iske alava marjar ke baad vodaphone-edia jo desh kii sabase badi telecom company banane ja rahi he, ne pichley saal mobile tower or dit ke dhandhe se baahar nikalate hue 19,000 karod rupee ekatra kiye the
 This company has acquired 6 foreign and domestic markets during the past few years
 2 arab dollar kaa karj uthaaya he
 Therefore, it is clear from the attitude of the telecom companies that the Indian telecom market is getting ready for a fierce competition
 is pratispartha ke chalate duniyabar ke niveshkon kii najar in telecom companiyon par lagi he
 The direct benefit of this competition outside is being given to the mobile consumers in the form of cheap call rates and data plans

 Narayani Devi's body was found lying on the ground in the room
 unki postmortem report par sabhi doctoron kii raay mail nahin kha rahi thi

 Let us tell that 11 members of this family of Burari were found hanging from the hanging noose in their house
 iske baad is maamle main lagaataar khulaase ho rahe hai
 The attack took place after the father's death
 The whole affair started in a very dramatic way
 pita kii maut ke baad dukaan par lalit kaa jhagada hua tha
 The attackers locked it inside the shop and set it on fire from outside
 lalit kii jaan to batch gai lekin dehshat main uski aawaaj chali gai thi
 Lalit and family were completely broken by this incident
 kai saal tak lalit kii aawaaj nahin lauti thi
 According to a register, Lalit used to tell the family members that he talks to the father's soul
 sutron kaa kahana he ki lalit ke sapane main ek din pita aae or kaha ki wo chintaa na kare, jaldi hi uski aawaaj laut aegi
 He wrote and shared this dream with the family as soon as he woke up in the morning
 phir aae din sapane main lalit ko apane pita dikhaai dene lage
 Manglik's sister was fixed, but after few days Lalit's unwavering faith started when his voice improved
 iske baad to lalit aksar pita kii aatma se milane kii baat karne laga
 Whatever he said, the family would have obeyed his father's orders
 ittfa dekhiye
 Lalit's sister Manglik Priyanka's marriage was getting hampered
 puja-paath ke baad uski shaadi tay ho gai
 The family started believing Lalit, not the family, the deceased family first had three shops
 bataaya jaataa he ki puraa parivaar iskaa shrey pita ke bataae raste ko detaa tha or lalit iskaa madhyam tha
 That is why the people of the family used to respect him like a father

 a post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Sep 22, 2018 at 3:58am pdtan opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about ‘my badge of honour’ that i was going to receive
 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that’s the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in a contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it’s unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can’t do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined, gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself!

 You must have heard the saying that poor seeks bread and rich hunger
 lekin agar garib ko khojane par bhi roti naa mili to vah kya khaae! roti naa milane par aapane garib ko juuthan khate hue bhi dekha hoga
 But a surprising reality has come to light in Jharkhand
 99 saal ke kaaru paswan ko garibi kii maar ne use keechad khaane par majaboor kar diya
 Karu Paswan from # Jharkhand when he was 11 years old when he first started eating it when i was 11 years old due to poverty but later it became a daily routine 'pic
 twitter
 com / nprrihaniy — ANI (@ANI) January 19, 2018 Karu Paswan said that due to extreme poverty he used to eat mud from his childhood
 vah mahaj 11 saal kaa tha jab usne keechad khaanaa shuru kiya or ab vah keechad kaa aadi ho chukaa he
 He told that he eats not a single kilo every day
 garibi main kataa bachapan, phir cat gaye haath, lekin ab hai safal bijnesamenusane bataaya ki main apni paise kii killat se kaaphi tang aa chukaa tha, mujhe 10 bacchon ko khaanaa khilaanaa padataa tha
 i wanted to die, but i started eating mud
 baad main mere andar ye aadat panpane lagi or maine roj 1 kilo keechad khaanaa shuru kar diya
 And now i cannot leave this habit
 juute polish kar jutaaye paise, ab garibon ke liye banavaa diya aspatalbilkul swasth or tandurust hai kaaru pasvanunke bade bete siyaaraam paswan ne bataaya ki parivaar main rahane vaale har sadsy ne unhen is aadat ko chhodane ke liye bolaa, lekin unhone kabhi nahin suna
 He sometimes picks up a piece of clay from somewhere and starts eating
 jaanakar hairaani hogi ki itane lambey samay se keechad khate hue bhi kaaru paswan bilkul swasth or tandurust hai
 He has also been awarded by Bihar for this habit
 bihar main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar endie ke sahyogi dal yani algepi, rashtriya lok samta party or hindustani avam morcha ne apni maang tej kar di he, lekin lagata he bijepi ko bantwaare kii koi jaldi nahin he
 The party wants to settle Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Bhagalpur first and only then to pay attention to seat sharing
 haalanki, aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki chunaav tarikhon ke elaan ke baad hi endie main siton kaa bantwaaraa ho
 By the way the internal war has started on the pull of seats, there are clear signs of this
 jaahir taur par bijepi ne isse nipatane ke liye khaas yojana bhi banaai hogi
 Let us understand what is the end of the bjp's seat-sharing gameplan
 1) The Prime Minister's rally in Bhagalpur on September 1 is probably going to be the most difficult rally for the BJP in terms of crowd gathering in all the rallies in Bihar
 saath hi 30 agast ko nitish-lalu kii swabhimaan raily ke mukaable kaa ek manovaigyanik dabaav bhi hoga
 The rally of Bhagalpur has been organized mainly keeping in mind the Munger and Bhagalpur divisions
 gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke daur main purvi bihar yaa ang pradesh ke is bhubhag main bijepi ke sahyogi dalon ko paaramparik taur par zyada siten milti rahi hai
 Therefore, BJP continued to contest on the front in relatively few seats in these areas
 lagaataar kai varshon tak party ke chunaav na ladane se kaaryakartaaon main ek swaabhaavik shithilataa aa jaati he
 The BJP may have won Banka's seat in the by-election to the assembly last year, but the BJP had to face defeat from the Congress on the decades-old seat in Bhagalpur
 loksabhaa chunaav main shahanvaj hossain kii haar ke baad bhagalpur vidhansabha seat haarane se bijepi ke manobal par gaharaa asar hua tha
 Therefore, on September 1, the BJP and its three allies are going to be tested on the scale of crowd gathering
 teenon dalon ko kitni siten deni hai, iskaa faisla lete vakt bijepi is raily main juty bheed kaa hisaab jarur karegi
 2) There was no problem in seat sharing in Lok Sabha elections with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 tab modi lahar main sabaki naiya paar lag gai thi, lekinvidhansabha chunaav main paristhitiyaan badali hui hai
 The ambitions of both Paswan and Kushwaha have increased, and on the other hand, after losing Delhi, Bihar election remains a question of life and death for BJP
 bijepi paswan or kushvaha ko ek samaan mahatv dene ke paksh main nahin he
 The LJP may still get a few more seats as a party with a certain (dalit) base, but the bjp's state and national level leaders are not in a mood to give the RLSP more
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki manmutabik siten na mil paane par bhi upendra kushvaha ke paas adhik vikalp nahin hai
 Kushwaha, who came out of JDU after a fierce confrontation with Nitish, cannot return to the Grand Alliance, the Union ministerial minister will continue to leave if the BJP leaves
 choti or apekshaakrit nai party hone kii vajah se akele chunaav ladane kaa na to unke paas jan-bal he naa hi dhan-bal
 In such a situation, the decision to break away from NDA can be very risky for his political career
 bijepi ko dar he ki jin siton par rashtriya lok samta party kaa ummidavaar khadaa hoga, vahaan agar uske saamne nitish kumaar kii jediu kaa ummidavaar rahaa to matadaata rashtriya lok samta party kii bajaae jediu ke paksh main matdaan kar denge
 In such a scenario, JDU is expecting net profit and NDA net loss
 kaante kii takkar vaale chunavi maahaul main nishchit taur par bijepi ke liye aisi paristhiti shubh nahin hogi
 Recently, in the election of 24 seats of Bihar Legislative Council, the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party could not even open the account
 pichley saal kuch aisi koshishen bhi huin thi ki rashtriya lok samta party kaa bijepi main vilay ho jaae, lekin bijepi ko isamen safalataa nahin mili
 Had success been achieved, it would not have created such a difficult situation for BJP today
 3)maanjhi ke kareebi kai vidhayakon ko party main shaamil karaane ke baad bijepi ne siton ko lekar maanjhi kii saudebaaji kii kshamta ko pehle se kaaphi kam diya he
 At the same time, Manjhi is also confident of getting a respectable place after the elections, so the seat-sharing from the Hindustani Awam Morcha seems unlikely

 There has been increasing fighting between the Congress and the BJP over the controversy over the company of Jai Shah, son of BJP President Amit Shah
 congress ne jahaan is prakaran ko 'betaa model' kii sangya dete hue bijepi par nishaanaa saadhane kii koshish kii he, vahiin bijepi ne palatwaar karte hue robert wadra ke sandarbh main 'damaad model' kii yaad dilaai he
 In Uttar Pradesh, Congress state president Raj Babbar at a press conference on Monday called the case of Amit Shah's son Jai Shahki company a 'son model' of business and demanded that it be investigated under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge
 
 raaj babbar ne saath hi jaanch puri hone tak sambandhit aropiyon ko unke padon se barkhaast karne kii maang bhi kii he, taaki isse jaanch prabhavit na ho
 Raj Babbar asked 7 questions to the BJP on this matter - First question - Why did Railway Minister Piyush Goyal clarify the controversy over the company of the son of BJP President? Second question - Amit Shah's son Jai Shah took note from demonetisation First, why did the company which gave its 16,000 times more profit in October 2016 shut down? Third question - if there was no scam, why did the company close? Fourth question - How did Jay Shah's company so much sh-fully? Fifth question- Why did the Income Tax Department not take any cognizance about it? Sixth question- How did 51 crore rupees come from abroad in Jai Shah's company? Seventh question - Reserve Bank of India gave Jai Shah's company only 6 crores 25 crores on security of property worth 20 lakh rupeeswhy did the Congress not pay attention to the loan given to it? While the Congress does not want to miss any opportunity to target the BJP over this dispute, the BJP is also seen in defense of Jai Shah from all the power
 raaj babbar jis vakt bijepi par 'betaa model' ke jariye nishaanaa saadh rahe the, usee vakt upi kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ke pravaktaa or cabinet mantri siddharthanath singh samvaadadaata sammelan karke congress ko 'damaad model' kii yaad dilaa rahe the
 Siddharth Nath Singh hit back at the Congress, saying, "the Congress does not have any issues, so it is trying to tarnish the image of the BJP president
" congress ko'damaad model'par spashtikaran dena chahie
 Investigation is going on in Vadra's case and he will go to jail
 "unka ishaara congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad roberd wadra ke kaarobaar ko lekar chal rahe cese kii ore tha
 It is notable that Robert Vadra has also been accused of similar corruption
 singh ne rahul gandhi ke sandarbh main kaha ki congress kaa balak bada nahin ho rahaa he or unhen yah dekh lenaa chahie tha ki jai shah kii company notebandi se pehle hi band ho gai thi

 Babulal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) and Shibu Soren's Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) have two members each in the Lok Sabha, while Madhu Koda is an Independent MP

 hindu dharm main makar sankrati kaa tyohaar pramukh tyoharon main se ek mana jaataa he
 The entry of Sun from one zodiac to another is called Sankranti
 yah tyohaar janvari maheene ke chaudaaven din manaaya jaataa he
 When the Sun enters Capricorn, then there is Makar Sankranti
 is tarah varsh main kul milakar 12 sankranti hoti hai, kyonki surya har maheene main raashi parivartan karata he
 But four of these solstices are important which include Aries, Cancer, Libra, Makar Sankranti
 makar sankranti par kyon khai jaati he khichdi?makar sankranti ke din alag-alag pakwaanon ke saath khichdi banane or khaane kaa khaas mahatv hota he
 For this reason, this festival is also known as Khichdi festival in many places
 darasal, chaaval kochandramaaka pratik mana jaataa he or urad kii daal ko shani kaa
 Green vegetables belong to Mercury
 manyata he ki khichdi kii garmi mangal or surya se judi he
 Therefore, eating khichdi on Makar Sankranti strengthens the position of planets in the zodiac
 kaha jaataa he ki is din nae ann kii khichdi khaane se puure saal aarogy miltaa he
 There is also a belief that on the Makar Sankranti Kedinkhichdi, Baba Gorakhnath's yogis were not able to cook during Khilji's invasion and were getting weaker with every waning day due to being hungry
 yogiyon kii bigadati haalat ko dekhte hue baba ne apane yogiyon ko chaaval, daal or subjiyon ko milakar pakaane kii salaah di
 This food was prepared in a short time and it also provided energy to the yogis
 baba gorakhnath ne is daal, chaaval or sabji se bane bhojan ko khichdi kaa naam diya
 This is the reason that even today, Khichdi fair is held near the temple of Baba Gorakhnath located in Gorakhpur on the festival of Makar Sankranti
 is dauraan baba ko khaastaur par khichdi ko bhoga lagaaya jaataa he

 Seeing whom Havan started burning with us
 phir chaahe baat kisi zulm kii ho, haadase kii yaa phir haadase ko dekh kar khamosh rahane vaale insaani tamashbinon kii
 We do not say such bitter things at all
 par kya karen jab hamaare or aapke shahar ke bich-bich ek shaks apni bivi or doodhpiti bacchee kii laashon ke bich khud ghayal hote hue apane zakhmi maasoom bete ko samete puure dedh ghante tak sadak par padaa madad ke liye gidgidaata rahe or uski madad ke liye puure shahar kii ek bhi khidki naa khule, to phir khud ke jinda hone par shaq naa ho to kya ho?darasal baichaiyn kar dene vaali ye ghatana jaipur kii guni tunnel kii hai
 a laughing family was passing through the tunnel when a speeding truck coming from behind hit the motorcycle on which the family was riding
 haadase ke vakt bike par miyaan-bivi, unki das maheene kii bitiyaa or chaar saal kaa betaa savaar tha
 The truck then ran away after collision and the whole family fell on a blood-soaked road
 par tab bhi sabhi kii saansen chal rahi thim
 The head of the family was himself injured but wanted to save his wife and children
 kaash! madad kii khidki vakt rahete khul jaati
 Because if it had happened then humanity would not have been ashamed
 bich sadak par das maheene kii maasoom bacchee or uski maa yun sisak-sisak or tadap-tadap kar naa marati
 According to CCTV footage, the head of the family, the injured Kanhaiya somehow manages himself and covers the injured wife, daughter and son and keeps them on the road together
 chaaron khun se lathpath the
 He needed to be taken to the hospital immediately
 lihaaja kanhaiya tunnel se guzarane vaale har insaan se madad kii bheekh maangata he
 During this time, dozens of vehicles and hundreds of human beings pass through the tunnel
 kuch gadiyon kii raftaar tak kam ho jaati he
 But not humans, they would just watch, think, save their car and escape with shamelessness
 jaise kuch hua hi naa ho
 Time was constantly passing
 khun betahasha bah rahaa tha
 The breath was suffocating every moment
 is, dauraan naa maaloom, kitne hi trek, bas, car, jeep, tampo, bike guzar gaye
 But there was not a single person riding in them
 kyonki koi rukaa hi nahin
 However, the person driving every passing vehicle was taking care that his car does not collide with the injured people on the middle road
 isliye wo speed kam karte phir un ghayalon se kanni katate guzar jate
 Kanhaiya, on the other hand, would watch every incoming vehicle from the point of view of life
 khun se lathpath hote hue bhi puri himmat se phir apni himmat sametataa
 He would call them, call them and as soon as he passed without stopping, he would again cling to his son, sometimes daughter, and sometimes wife
 rota, sir peethta or phir agali gaadi ko bebasii se dekhne lagata ki shaayad unamem to koi insaan nazar aa jaae
 And in this way, humanity did not just die in the hope of humans
 balki pehle kanhaiya kii das maheene kii maasoom ne sadak par dam todaa or phir uske kuch der baad hi uski bivi ne bhi patharilii sadak par hi patthardil shahar ko alavida kah diya
 But Kanhaiya was still not tired
 ab bhi wo paaglon kii tarah ro rahaa tha, cheekh rahaa tha
 He was begging, folding his hands, that at least someone should save his son
 aakhirkaar kareeb dedh ghante baad ek motor cycle savaar ke andar kaa insaan jaag hi uthaa
 First he stopped, then after seeing him, second stopped, then third stopped and then somewhere Kanhaiya's search for humans ended
 par kaash! yahi insaan kuch der pehle agar insaan ban jate to kya pataa kanhaiya kii bivi or beti batch jate

Party leaders say that the strengthening of the image of communal intolerance and on the contrary the slowing of Modi's pro-development image started from the winter of 2014, when organizations associated with the RSS Launched two separate campaigns

 "many ministers regret that such unbridled guns have given the opposition a chance to divert public attention away from development
 ek varisht kendriya mantri kaa kahana he ki modi ne in tatwon ko niyantran main karne kii koshish kii thi
 He says, "the removal of the RSS pracharak Rajeshwar Singh from Dharm Jagran (homecoming in Western Uttar Pradesh) is a clear example of behind-the-scenes action
 "lekin jab tak modi dharmik alpsankhyak samudaayon ke logon ko bharosa dilaane ke liye pehali baar khuli koshish karte, tab tak vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne or janata ke ek bade varg ko aanshik rup se yah samajhane main safal ho gaya tha ki modi ke ''achche din" kaa vaada bas vaada hi tha
 The problem for the BJP is that its leaders understand the dilemma here and there
 ek sarkari adhikari, jo vaajapeyi sarkaar main bhi kaary kar chuke hai, kehete hai, ''samasya yah he ki bijepi saarvajanik rup se khud ko un chintaaon se alag nahin kar sakati he, jo sangh ke netaaon ke vichaar-vimarsh main vyakt hoti hai

 Says a government official, "when RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is giving a long speech on 'hindu Rashtra' at the same time, how can the Prime Minister, who himself has been an RSS pracharak, respond publicly to those people?"

 aaj ke daur main life jitani soshal ho chuki he relation utani hi complicatod hoti ja rahi he
 This is a sign in social media, which indicates that you are insured in your relationship
 agar aapkaa partner ye cheez bahut adhik karata he to aapako chintaa kerani chahie
 You will be surprised to know that if your partner is more active on the social media then he may feel insured
 saamaajik vaigyanik anusandhan ke anusaar, fasebuk, instagram or anya soshal media site ek pramukh indicater ho saktaa he
 Which tells how strong your relationship is
 ek adhyayan main pataa chalaa he ki soshal media kisi bhi rishte ko banane or todane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 According to research, people who think more about their relationship are more active on Facebook
 jarurat se zyada photo aplod karte hai
 And those who feel more insecure share their photos more on social media
 iskaa kaaran ye bhi ho saktaa he ki agar aapane koi photo aplod kii or us par zyada like or coment aaye to aapak relation khatre main pad saktaa he
 Because your partner can feel gels from this time
 jo log apane rishte main zyada khush or sabase zyada surakshit feel karte hai, wo soshal media se unke rishte ko dur rakhane kii koshish karte hai
 Because such people think that they do not need to show their relationship to the world
 jarurat se zyada soshal media kaa upyog karnaa depressant kaa shikaar mana jaataa he, kyonki jo is cheez kaa shikaar hote he wo apane rishte ko dusron ke rishte se campare karne kii koshish karte hai
 They show that their relationship is better than others
 lekin jo log asurakshit nahin hote hai wo apni jindagi jite hai
 They don't mean anything to anyone else
 wo ek-duusare ke lietime nikaaltehain
 In fact, it is not at all that if one of you spends too much time on social media, your relationship may break or you do not love each other
 lekin soshal media kaa zyada istemaal karata he wo insakyor ho saktaa he

 The latest draft of the agreement, which was drafted at the ongoing climate change conference in Paris, seems to find a place in India's demand that appealed to developed countries to adopt a simple and simple lifestyle
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne paris jalwaayu parivartan mahasammelan main 30 november ko die apane bhaashan main iskaa zikr kiya tha
 Due to the luxurious lifestyle of developed countries, electricity is being consumed manifold and due to this, carbon emissions are increasing in the environment
 yahaan paris main guuruuvaar raat ko samjhaute kaa jo nayaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya he, usamen solahaven panne par is baat ko likhaa gaya he ki sabhi desh sastenbal life style ( kam se kam vilasitapurna jivan) kii koshish karenge, jiske tahat upbhog kii chizon kii khapat or unka utpaadan kam kiya jayega
 At the same time, developed countries will take the first steps for this
 vastav main viksit deshon main log rosemara ke har kaam ke liye electronic or electric upkarnon kaa andhadhundh istemaal karte hai, jo paryaavaran ke liye acha nahin he, kyonki isamen bijli kii kaaphi khapat hoti he
 Developing countries have been demanding that countries like America reduce luxuries, reduce the use of cars and reduce per capita consumption of electricity and water
 tippaniyan Action Aid's international policy manager Harjeet Singh says that every American consumes 34 times more electricity than an Indian for personal needs
 lima main pichley saal hui clamet change summit main jeevanstyli ko lekar ye baaten itane saaf tareeke se nahin kahi gayi jo ab kahi ja rahi hai
 And now if this is said in the agreement, then it is a good sign
 acha hoga ki is par sabhi desh kerani or kathani main antar na karen
 Due to pollution from industries and vehicles, the carbon level has increased to dangerous levels and the temperature of the earth is increasing
 ise rokane ke liye hi paris main ye jaddojahad chal rahi he
 It is important that while Prime Minister Modi has given advice to western countries on living, in India also the urban population should start implementing it, because the use of cars and consumption of electricity to keep cities clean did not stop
 So it will be difficult to live
 dilli main isaki chintaa saaf dikh rahi he
 The new draft of the agreement, which was drafted on Thursday night here in Paris, reads on the sixteenth page that all countries will try a sustainable life style (at least a luxury life), under which consumption of goods consumed And their production will be reduced
 vahiin viksit desh iske liye sabase pehle kadam uthaaenge
 In fact, people in developed countries use electronic and electric appliances indiscriminately for every day work, which is not good for the environment, because it consumes a lot of electricity
 vikasshil deshon kii maang rahi he ki america jaise desh vilasita kam karen, kaaron kaa istemaal ghataaen or bijli or pani kii prati vyakti khapat kam karen
 The comments ection aid ke antarrashtriya policy manager harjit singh kaa kahana he ki har america nijee zaruuraton ke liye ek bhartiya ke mukaable 34 guna zyada bijli kii khapat karata he
 At the Climate Change Summit held in Lima last year, these things were not said so clearly about the lifestyle that is being said now
 or ab agar samjhaute main ye baat kahi gai hai to ye acha sanket he
 It would be good that all countries should not do this and do not differentiate between words
 udyogon or vaahanon se ho rahe pradooshan kii vajah se carbon kaa str khatarnaak str tak bad gaya he or dharti kaa taapmaana bad rahaa he
 To stop this, this struggle is going on in Paris
 mahatvapurn he ki pradhanmantri modi ne jahaan pashchimi deshon ko rahan-sahan ko lekar salaah di he, vahiin bharat main bhi shahari aabaadi is par amal karnaa shuru kare, kyonki shaharon ko saaf rakhane ke liye kaaron kaa istemaal or bijli kii khapat main roak nahin lagi to jeena mushkil ho jayega

 'don' kaa daawa he ki bhartiya sena ne elosi par cross border firing kii jisamen kuch pakistani naagarik maare gaye, phir pakistani sena kii javaabi firing kii jisamen bhartiya sainik maare gaye
 Thepakistan newspaper 'the Nation' wrote, 'general Sharif is firm on his decision to retire
 ye logon ko chaunkaa rahaa he
 He had many chances to continue in office by extending his tenure
 kai log aisa kah bhi rahe the
 Sharif had a golden opportunity to stay in the post after Nawaz's name appeared in the Panama Papers and increased tensions from India
 'vidaai hairaan karne vaali'da express tribune' kaa kahana he, 'aisapiaar ke diarector general asif bajva ke ek twit se media main hadakamp he
 This debate came to an end
 sena or sarkaar main lagaataar rassakashi ke kaaran ritairement kii khabaren pakistan kii raajnneeti kaa ahm mudda ban gaya
 In a country where many army chiefs either stay in office for long periods of time by extension or overthrow overnight, there is nothing to be amazed about Sharif's retirement? According to him, "the army chief did not drop despite pleas by friends, colleagues, politicians to review his decision
" ek ke baad ek aise maukey aae jab sarkaar par janata ne dabaav badhaayaa ki vah sharif se pad par bane rahane kaa aagrah kare
 But in the end the right thing was maintained and a good official could be given an official farewell this week
 ' pakistani sena kii vishwasaneeyata sabit karne main general sharif kaa yah faisla kaaphi ahm he
 The Pakistani media is also surprised because both Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and General Pervez Musharraf had got extensions before General Sharif
 general musharraf ne to navaj sharif sarkaar kaa takhtapalat tak kar diya tha
 The 15th Army Chief of Pakistan, Rahil Sharif, took over the post of Chief of Army Staff on 29 November 2013
 wo jindagi se zyada maut ke bare main jaananaa chahta tha
 Wanted to find out the truth after death
 murdon ko dhundhna uskaa shauk tha
 Talking with the dead is his pastime
 anjaan or adrishy logon kii paheli bujhaana uskaa pesha
 But now his death itself became a puzzle
 7 july ko mashhoor paranarmal investigator gaurav tiwari kii rahasyamayi halaaton main maut ho gai
 Sometimes he used to lie with the dead in a deserted mansion, sometimes in ruins, sometimes in a cemetery, sometimes in a deserted desert
 yahaan tak kimurdagharake andar bhi
 He knew his truth by lying with the dead
 unase baaten kiya karata tha
 Sadly, the same Gaurav Tiwari became his own death puzzle
 32 saal kaa noujvaan gaurav america se profeshnal payalat kii training bich main chhod kar hindustan laut aayaa
 Upon coming here, he formed the Indian Paranormal Society

 He was lying on the floor in the bathroom of his own house
 uske gale par kaale rang ke gahare nishaan mili hai
 These scars are similar to those which usually occur when the noose is tightened in the throat
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya gaurav ne khudakushi kii? kya uskaa katl kiya gaya? kya uskaa kaam uski maut kii vajah bani? kya uske adrishy mehmaan hi uske dushman ban baithe? kya negative soch haaavee ho gai thi?gaurav kii maut ko lekar uthe ye sawalgaurav kii jindagi jin rahasyon ko talashne main beeti kuch vaise hirahasyamyiswaal ab uski maut ke baad bhi uth rahe hai
 He had neither any financial crisis nor any kind of trouble
 haal hi main shaadi kii or khush bhi tha
 There was no disease either
 maut se ek din pehle kii aakhri raat bhi wo apane kaam par laga tha
 Was investigating another haunted place in Delhi
 yahaan tak ki marane se bas minute bhar pehle tak bhi bilkul thik tha
 Was checking mail on his laptop
 iske baad wo achaanak uth kar bathroom jaataa he
 Gaurav had told his wife that after some time, the housemates get the sound of something falling in the bathroom
 isi ke baad jab gaurav ke pita or patni bathroom main jhaankate hai to wo farsh par besudh miltaa he
 He is then taken to the hospital, but by then he was dead
 gaurav kii maut ke baad poochtacha ke dauraan gaurav kii bivi ne police ko ek ajeeb baat bataai
 She said that she said a few days before she died that some negative forces were forcing her to die
 bivi ko tab laga ki zyada kaam kii vajah se wo depressant main he
 In search of unknown powers, on 6 July, Gaurav was at home all day
 shaam saadhe saat baje wo janakapuri ke ek honted place kii chaanbin ke liye ghar se niklaa
 The unknown powers he discovered often required staying out of the house until late at night
 uski tafteesh amuman raat ko hi hua karti
 After completing his investigation in Janakpuri, he returns home at half past one in the night
 raat ko der se aane par miyaan-bivi main jhagada hua
 Gaurav and the rest of the house fell asleep
 ghar par gaurav or uski patni ke alaava uske mata-pita bhi saath rahete the
 After all, how did Gaurav die? After waking up on the morning of July, all have breakfast
 gaurav apane computer par lag jaataa he
 He was checking email
 kareeb 11 baje uski laash bathroom main milti he
 After the initial investigation, the police believe that Gaurav committed suicide
 vah apane kaam ko lekar depressant tha
 Information about this is yet to be collected
 gaurav ke ghar vaale yah kah rahe hai ki vah kabhi khudakushi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Because he had no reason to die
 police apni jaanch kar rahi he
 Gaurav's post-mortem report is awaited
