 Party President Sharad Yadav has called a meeting of the legislature party in Patna on Saturday
 vahiin, mukhyamantri ne is tarah kii baithak ke bulaane kaa gaiyr-kanoonee bataaya he
 He says that the Chief Minister has the right to call such a meeting
 baithak hangaamedaar hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Although the agenda of this meeting is not currently being decided, but it is understood that apart from removing Manjhi in this meeting, Nitish Kumar will be requested to take command as the new leader
 party sutron kii maane to rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne pehle maanjhi se istipha maanga, lekin maanjhi ne saafe kar diya ki ye maang nitish kumaar kii taraf se aani chahie
 Then Sharad Yadav made him talk to Nitish Kumar
 tab maanjhi ne maang rakhi ki nitish ko media ke madhyam se unase istipha maangana chahie or tab wo media main apane kaarykaal ke dauran kiye gaye kaamon ko rakhenge or janata or media faisla kare ki unhen istipha dena chahie
 Manjhi's attitude was clear that at present he is not ready to resign and in such a situation it is not easy to take his resignation
 is bich kendriya mantri or lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh rambilas paswan ne kaha ki nitish ke dabaav main maanjhi se istipha lene kaa prayaas ho rahaa he or agar maanjhi ko hataaya gaya to us vyakti or party kaa rajnatik safaya ho jayega
 At the same time, before this, Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi took a break on the news of his resignation and said that there is no question of resignation
 mujhase istipha sharad yadav ne nahin maanga he
 Sharad Yadav came to eat at me
 istipha kii baat sirf media main he

 Earlier meeting the Chief Minister was a difficult task, now it has become easier
 jithan ram maanjhi ne ek baar phir adhikariyon ko dhamkaate hue kaha ki agar kaaryakartao evam garibon ko block evam thana se bhagane kaa kaary kiya gaya to us adhikari ko bhaga duungaa
 The Chief Minister said that the way the Central Government has done the trick to deceive the people in the Lok Sabha elections, the people will work to teach them a lesson in the upcoming assembly elections
 maanjhi ne murajhaai hui awaz main kaha ki jab main garibon ke liye kuch kar rahaa hum to mujh par tarah tarah kaa dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he
 But i will continue to work for the poor
 unhone sukhdev prasad verma kii punyatithi rajyakeey sammaan ke saath manaane kii ghoshnaa karte hue unki adamkad pratimaa lagane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii
 Appreciating the work of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Jitan Ram Manjhi said that i am working to carry forward the development roadmap prepared by Nitish Kumar

 vah baharaa he, lekin uske anumaan bahut sateek hote hai

 Responding to the debate on Kashmir in the Lok Sabha, Home Minister Amit Shah said that every child of the country speaks that Kashmir is an integral part of India
 unhone kaha ki kyon kahana padaa he ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he? kya kabhi ham yah poochhate hai ki uttar pradesh bharat kaa abhinn ang he? unhone kaha ki dhara 370 aaj sadan ke aashirwad se khatm ho jaaegi or yah din itihaas main swarna aksharon se likhaa jayega
 Home Minister Amit Shah said that as soon as the situation becomes normal, Jammu and Kashmir will be given full state status
 amit shah ne kaha ki dhara 370 kashmir or bharat ko ek duusare se nahin jodatii
 The Home Minister said that Article 370 had created a doubt in the mind of this country and the world whether Kashmir is an integral part of India or not? Amit Shah said that some people of the opposing party also want Section 370 to be removed from Kashmir
 grih mantri ne kaha ki bina cabinet ke vishwaas main liye ol india radio se kashmir mudde ko yuan le jane kii ghoshnaa kisne kii thi, pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kii thi
 He said that even the opponents want Article 370 to be removed
 shah ne kaha ki 371 or 370 ke bich kaa antar desh kii janata samajhati he or aap isse gumraah nahin kar paaenge
 Amit Shah said that no one had the courage to speak on 370
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 370 par rasta sahi nahinhai
 But let me tell you that the way is fine but not good for your vote bank politics
 aaj kaha ja rahaa he ki vahaan par internet nahin chal rahaa he lekin isse buree haalat to pehle thi
 We have done everything for the security system there and we will not let anything happen, under pressure you will not remove the security forces
 aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki charchaa nahin kii gai
 But while talking, 70 years have passed but the discussion has not ended
 ham kisase charchaa karen jo pakistan se chanda lete hai
 We will not talk to the Hurriyat
 lekin ghati ke log hamaare hai
 We will embrace them
 lekin jab vakt badalata he to charchaa karne kaa tarika bhi badalanaa padataa he
 Unemployment and unemployment is the problem of every state
 lekin vahaan 370 nahin he
 Due to this, separatism has increased in Kashmir
 main phir kahana chahta hum ki jammu-kashmir main halaat saamaanya honge to ham isko purna rajya kaa darja denge or hamen 70 saal nahin lagenge or aapkaa bataa den ki abhi tak vahaan sthiti bigadi nahin he
 Curfew has been imposed so that the situation does not deteriorate
 shah ne kaha ki kaha ja rahaa he ki yah sampradayik agenda he
 Are there not Hindus, Jains and Buddhists in Jammu? anuchhed 370 se desh ke alpsankhyakon ke saath anyaay ho rahaa tha
 Since 1989, 41900 people have been killed and even today, walk in the same path on which we have been walking for 70 years
 kabhi to alag hatakar sochna padegaa
 i congratulate the young MP from Ladakh who has made his point
 auwaisi ne kaha ki sadan aitihaasik bhul karne ja rahaa he, auwaisi sahab sadan aitihaasik bhul ko sudhaarney ja rahaa he
 The home minister said, "my party's tradition is that the decision is taken after seeing who is in the good of the country
" amit shah ne kaha ki aaj kisi ne yah nahin bataaya ki anuchhed 370 kis tarah kashmir kaa kalyaan kar sakati he
 But i will tell how it hurts Kashmir
 yah dhara, vikaas, mahila or garib virdohi he or aatankwaad ko badhaava dene vaali he
 Amit Shah said, 'I don't want to be an Iron Man
 party kaa saadhaaran kaaryakarta hum
 Due to section 370, child marriage law cannot be enforced
 rashtriya alpsankhyak ayog kyon nahin bana vahaan jain buddha alpsankhyakon ke rup rahete hai
 After that the right to education has been given by the Parliament of the country
 lekin jammu-kashmir ke bacchon ko yah adhikaar nahin he kyoki 370 lagu kii thi
 The Land Acquisition Bill could not be implemented
 jammu-kashmir main dilimitesan nahin ho paaya
 But now this will not do
 'amit shah ne kaha ki aage kaha ki congress party artiai act kii baat karti he lekin vahaan lagu nahin ho paaya he
 Because corruption of some families is flourishing
 aapako bataa den ki vahaan 370 kii chintaa nahin he chintaa is baat kii he vahaan kuch filein khul gai hai
 It is a matter of concern
 thand main unako pasinaa aa gaya he
 Democracy has been strangled using 370
 aaj main piem modi ke shashan ko dhanyavad detaa hum aaj jammu-kashmir ke andar 40 hajaar sarpanch ane vikaas kaa khaakaa khud khinch rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the bill dividing Jammu Kashmir into two union territories was passed in Rajya Sabha
 ab jammu kashmir or ladakh (ladakh) ko centre shasit pradesh banaaya jayega
 The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill saw 125 votes in favor and 61 in opposition
 mangalvaar ko yah bill loksabhaa (lok Sabha) main pesh kiya jayega
 Along with this, the Central Government also announced the removal of Article 370 (article 370) from Jammu and Kashmir
 iske saath hi jammu kashmir ko mila vishesh rajya kaa darja bhi khatm ho gaya
 This decision of the government has been supported by some opposition parties besides the BJP and its allies

 jadeja ke mutabik jiskaa unhen sabase zyada dar tha, vahi hakeekat main badal gaya
 If Jadeja believes, he had expressed this idea in 2015 itself
 tab jadeja ne gitanjali jewelers ke maalik mehul chaukasee ke kilaaf gujarat police ke siaidi vibhaag main shikaayat darj karai thi
 Jadeja had alleged that Mehul Choksi cheated him and cheated him of about 90 crores
 mehul chaukaseeke khilaaf is silsile main janvari 2015 main FIR darj hui
 Mehul Choksi appealed to the Gujarat High Court to quash the FIR after the case was caught

 Due to this, Mehul Chowkasi is also likely to run abroad like Vijay Mallya

 If he runs abroad, all the cases going against him will be hanging in the balance
 2)mehul chaukasee ne farji skiimon ke jariye karmchaariyon or aam janata kaa paisa lutaa he
 Through these schemes named Shagun, Suvarna Mangal Labh, Suvarna Mangal Kalash, he has poured dust into the eyes of people by promising them jewelry
 ye sari skim gitanjali jewelers kii ore se laai gai thim
 3) Not only this, Mehul Choksi through Gitanjali Jewelers Limited gave franchise to many people and promised an interest of 9% to 14% while giving a minimum guarantee or talked about giving a margin on 41% jewelry, due to which all the heavy Damage done
 uske khilaaf cese daayar kiye gaye hai
 Through his 32-page affidavit, Jadeja appealed for a police action and a thorough probe against Mehul in the Gujarat High Court
 baharhaal, gujarat hoicourt ne maamle ko nirast kar diya or saath hi mehul ke videsh jane par roak lagane se bhi inkaar kar diya
 Even after this, Jadeja did not give up and appealed in the Supreme Court against the decision of Gujarat High Court
 jadeja ko lagata he ki agar unki 2015 main suni gai hoti to desh ko ye din nahin dekhnaa padataa

 '' mere pyaare kamazor or kamasin se rupaiya, i keep watching the news of your falling in the media every day
 sach kahuun to main tumhaare girane kii khabaron ko padhakar kuch mahasoos nahin karata
 Like i am very sad or very happy that someone has fallen
 mujhe pataa nahin ki girane se tum ghayal hote ho yaa kaagaz par hi girte rahete ho
 How can a rupee fall on paper? to kya tum nazaron se gir jate ho, kahin aisa to nahin meri tarah bukamp se tum bhi ghabaraate hue dolate rahete ho
 Even so, to be a commuter
 seedhi or lift se mat bhaagna
 Friend, standing in a safe place
 khayr, tumhaare girane kii koi jagah he to bataa dena
 i will come myself or send someone
 dekho, rupaya tum giro mat
 i do not understand the account of your fall
 64 saal kii umr main koi pradhanmantri banakar athak parishram karata rahata he, desh duniya main bhaagate rahata he or tum ho ki 64 par pahunch kar gire hue maan liye jate ho
 You are considered weak
 ye koun log hai, jo tumhen patansheel bataa rahe hai
 How progressive our life becomes with you
 desh kaa jivan vikasshil ho jaataa he or tum ho ki gire hue bataaye ja rahe ho
 You are being called weak bolo ki ham kamazor nahin hue hai
 We have gone to the gully kept in the purse, but we have the strength and the price is still left, Pushpa
 bol de rajesh khanna vaala dialog
 Rupalli, can i lovingly call you Rupalli instead of Rs
 chowk-chaubaare par tumhen kitne log rupalli bhi pukaarte hai
 Do not take 'assemble'
 tum kab girte the or kab uchhalte the hamen pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 If a new journalist is created, one of our editors keeps telling us throughout the day that, brothers, the rupee which is the rupee keeps climbing against the dollar
 ham to khush hi ho gaye
 Our rupee also hits the dollar
 aankh bhi dikhaa detaa he
 Dollar believes America kills Bhaijaan
 ham to bole the ki shaabaash rupalli
 We could not do anything but you continue to do wonders
 magar isse zyada tumhaara kamazor hona bujhaata nahin tha
 Two years ago, when the election atmosphere was heated up, neither did we see that Rojje people are tweeting that the rupee has weakened even today
 hai re desh kahaan pahunch gaya
 We are in the abyss that the rupee is at 64
 jo bhi tumko 64 par dekhtaa tha na, sopha par baithe baithe feel karne lagata tha ki drawing room se sarak kar basament main aa gaya he
 One leader said that once we were equal to the dollar
 ek dollars baraabar ek rupaya
 We will bring the rupee equal to the dollar
 tab ham jhat se google maare ki tab dollars kii barabari ke dinon main hamaare haseen sapane kya the
 Did not get an answer
 pataa nahin kab or kaise tum dollars ke naam par kabhi idhar to kabhi udhar dolane lage
 Hearing that, if you want to save the country from going to the abyss, you have to do something rupalli
 desh kii pratishtha ko tum yun na subah shaam giraaya karo, kha pikar date raho, meri gali aayaa karo
 i am writing this song to inspire you
 lagata he ki tum bhi 64 par pahunch javaani jaisaa feel karte ho
 That is why you reach there again and again
 ham ganit main vidwaan rahete to samajhate ki 61 par aate ho to majboot ho jate ho or 64 par jate ho to kamazor
 Like weighing some potatoes in vegetable market
 ek aalu nikaala to palada udhar or ek rakh diya to idhar
 Tell me exactly when your weakness is extinguished
 61 par yaa 64 par
 Look, Rupee, we love you
 baap bada na bhaiya
 The biggest thing that is the biggest rupee
 tumko sabase bada kaha gaya or tum ho ki ludhak jate ho
 You can't be drinking or not
 bataa do
 The government has a program on de-addiction
 rupee se pyaar na karte to ham din raat aise na khatate
 For whose sake we are engaged in the responsibility of whom, you will not even know
 tum ho ki aav dekhe na taav ludhak jate ho
 It is good that now people do not make a ruckus when you fall
 jiskaa thikaana nahin ki kab koun kahaan gir pade uske chakkar main koun pade
 That's why you have become a senior citizen
 train main loar berth bhi milegaa tumko
 The freight will also be less
 63-64 saal main hamaare gaanv main log tirthayatra par nikal jate hai
 You are that you drown at the point of 64 (you roll at the door)
 vitamin den tumko
 Bournvita or Horlicks
 chintaa mat karo
 Quit competing against the dollar
 maan lo hamari baat
 Tell the world that we believe in 'myself'
 main jo hum wo hum
 I'm weak or strong i don't know, I'm 64
 isliye rupaya tum phikar mat karo
 Say that we have fallen
 ham dollars ke saath match khel hi nahin rahe he
 Nothing happens to India when it is 64
 i koi richter scale nahin he ki ek jhatka aayaa or sab building se baahar
 You fall or do not fall belongs to us
 tum jahaan jaakar girte ho ham to vahaan pahunche bina hi gire hue hai
 Wherever you go, you are called climbing and we are said to have fallen there
 sune hai ki tum videsh bhi chale jate ho ghoomane ke liye or jate ho to laut kar nahin aate
 The Finance Minister has made a law that from now on any rupee will go black and will have to be told to turn white
 ye bhi sune hai ki tum videshi bank main luka (chhip) jate ho
 Lukaye Lukaye turns black and here Jethmalani ji is arguing daily in court to get you out
 isliye he rupaya tum videsh jaao
 Who does not feel to roam abroad but come back
 shahrukh khan kii film swadesh kii tarah
 The rupee of Make in India abroad is not a good thing Rupalli
 yahaan bank nahin hai tumhaare chhipane ke liye
 If you want to go black then why do you go abroad
 yahi ho jaao
 Someone stops you
 tippaniyan You be strong vir bano
 One day the dollar will fall against you
 tum kabhi nahin giroge
 That day is coming aane se pehle tum girane kii apni sabhi khwahishen puri kar lo
 Being weak is not a crime
 rupalli tu apni life ji le
 Do not load
 tum purse main tatka-tatka( tazaa) kitna acha lagate ho
 When you are with me, no one else is there
 ye gaanaa he lekin ye gaanaa tumko dedicket kar diye hai
 Listen to the song Rupalli
 mouj kar
 Live the life from free mind
 kamazor or majboot rahane se kuch nahin hota he
 That's why you go on your path
 anaar kaa zeus piyo
 But don't be weak
 64 raho yaa 64 ke paar jaao magar indian bane raho
 Your weakness is not the weakness of anyone
 tumhaara bada bhaiyya ravish Kumar aae din samachar madhyamon main tumhaare girte-padate rahane kii khabaren dekhtaa rahata hum
 To tell the truth, i do not feel anything after reading the news of your fall
 jaise ki bahut dukhi ho gaya hum yaa bahut khush hum ki koi to gira
 i do not know if you are injured due to falling or you keep falling on paper
 kagaz par koi kaise gir saktaa he rupaya
 So do you fall out of sight, is it like me that you keep on trembling with the earthquake
 itnaa bhi kya kamasin hona
 Do not run from the ladder and lift
 sef jagah par khadey rahanaa dost
 Well, if you have a place to fall, then tell me
 main khud aa jaaoongaa yaa kisi ko bhej duungaa
 Look, don't fall in the money mujhe to tumhaare girane kaa hisaab samaj nahin aata
 At the age of 64, someone works tirelessly as a Prime Minister, the country keeps on running in the world and you are the one who reaches 64 and is considered fallen
 kamazor maan liye jate ho
 Who are these people who are telling you to decline? tumhaare hone se hamaara jivan kitna pragatisheel ho jaataa he
 The life of the country becomes developing and you are being told that the fallen
 kamazor kahe ja rahe ho
 Say that we have not weakened
 ham purse main rakhe rakhe gal zarur gaye hai magar ham main dam or daam ab bhi baaki he re puspa
 Say the dialogue with Rajesh Khanna
 rupalli, kya main pyaar se tumhen rupee kii jagah rupalli kah saktaa hum
 How many people call you Rupalli at chowk-chaubare
 ‘adrabhaij’ mat lenaa
 We did not know when you used to fall and when you used to jump
 nayaa nayaa patrkaar bana to hamaare ek sampadak din bhar bataate rahete ki dekho bhai log, i jo rupaya he dolarava ke mukaable hi chadhataa rahata he
 We were happy only
 hamaara rupaya dollars ko patake bhi detaa he
 The eye also shows
 dollars maane america bhaijan ko aankh maar detaa he
 We said that well done Rupalli
 ham to nahin kar sake tu hi kamaal karte rahio
 But more than this, you did not stop being weak
 do saal pehle jab chunaav kaa maahaul garmaya na to ham dekhe ki rojje log twit kar rahe hai ki aaj bhi rupaya kamazor ho gaya
 Where has the country reached? ham rasaatal main hai ki rupaya 64 par he
 Whoever saw you at 64, felt sitting on the sofa that he had moved from the drawing room to the basement
 ek netaa ne kaha ki kabhi ham dollar ke baraabar the
 One dollar equals one rupee
 ham rupee ko dollar ke baraabar le aayenge
 Then we quickly hit Google what were our beautiful dreams in the days of dollar parity
 jawaab nahin mila
 i do not know when and how in the name of the dollar, you have started shouting here and there
 sunate sunate laga ki agar mulk ko rasaatal main jane se bachaana he ki tumko rupalli kuch karnaa hoga
 Put down the prestige of the country in the morning and evening, eat and drink, stay in my street
 ye main gaanaa likh rahaa hum tumko prerit karne ke liye rupaya
 It seems that you too feel like reaching youth at 64
 isiilie baar-baar vahiin pahunch jate ho kaa
 If we were scholars in mathematics, we would think that by coming to 61, you become strong and when you go to 64, you are weak
 sabzi mandi main koi aalu taul rahaa ho jaise
 Take out a potato, put the pan there and keep one here
 tum thik-thik bataao ki tumko kamazori kab bujhaata he
 At 61 or at 64
 dekho, rupaya, ham tumko pyaar karte hai
 Father is not very brother
 da hole thing inz dait ki sabase bada rupaya
 You have been called the greatest and you are the one who falls
 pite-pate to nahin ho na
 tell
 sarkaar ne nashamukthi par program chalaaya hua he
 If we did not love money, we would not spend day and night like this
 tumhaari khaatir ham kis kis kii khatiradaari main lage hai, tumko maaloom bhi na hoga
 You are not looking at things, you are rolling
 acha hua ki ab log tumhaare girane par hangaamaa nahin karte
 Who does not care about who falls in the circle of who, when and where he falls
 isliye he rupaya tum ho gaye ho senior citijan
 You will also get lower birth in the train
 haada bhi kam lagegaa
 In 63-64 years, people go out on pilgrimage in our village
 tum ho ki 64 ke duaariye par dhimla jate ho ( darvaaze par hi ludhak jate ho)
 Give you vitamins
 bornvita yaa horlix
 Do not worry
 dollars se muqabla chhod do
 Say our words
 kah do duniya se ki ham ‘miself’ main yakeen karte hai
 i am who i am
 wo kamazor hum yaa majboot hum mujhe nahin pataa, main 64 hum to hum
 So don't worry about money
 kaho ki ham apane gir gaye hai
 We are not playing matches with the dollar
 64 ke hone par bharat ko kuch nahin hota he
 e there is no Richter scale that a blow came and all out of the building
 tum giro yaa mat giro hamako kaa he
 Wherever you fall, we reach there without falling
 tum jahaan jaakar chadhe hue kehalaate ho ham to vahaan chadhakar bhi gire hue kehalaate hai
 Have you heard that you go abroad too for a walk and do not come back
 vitt mantri ne kanoon banaaya he ki ab se koi bhi rupaya blike hokar baahar jayega use safed karne ke liye bataanaa padegaa
 It is also heard that you go and hide in a foreign bank
 lukaye lukaye kaala pad jate ho or ihaan jethmalani ji tumko nikaal kar laane ke liye rose court main bahes kar rahe hon
 That's why you go abroad
 kiskaa man nahin karata he videsh main ghoomane ke liye lekin waapas aa jaao
 Like Shahrukh Khan's film Swadesh
 mek in india kaa rupaya videshon main rahe acchhee baat nahin he rupalli
 There are no banks here for you to hide
 kaala hi hona he to videsh main jaakar kyon hote ho
 This is it
 koi roktaa he kaa ji tumko
 The comments tum majboot bano
 Be brave
 ek din dollars tumhaare mukaable giregaa
 You will never fall wo din aa rahaa he
 Before you come, fulfill all your wishes to fall
 kamazor hona koi gunaah nahin hota he
 Rupalli live your life
 lod mat le
 How nice you look in the purse
 tum jab mere paas hote ho to doosraa koi nahin hota
 It is a song but this song has been dedicated to you
 rupalli gaanaa sun
 Have fun
 free mind se life ji
 Being weak and strong does nothing
 isliye he rupaya tum apane maarg par chalo
 Drink pomegranate juice
 magar kamazor mat bano
 Stay 64 or go beyond 64 but stay Indian
 tumhaari kamazori kisi kii siinaajori nahin he
 Your big brother raveesh kumaar Look, don't fall in the money mujhe to tumhaare girane kaa hisaab samaj nahin aata
 At the age of 64, someone works tirelessly as a Prime Minister, the country keeps on running in the world and you are the one who reaches 64 and is considered fallen

 nayaa nayaa patrkaar bana to hamaare ek sampadak din bhar bataate rahete ki dekho bhai log, i jo rupaya he dolarava ke mukaable hi chadhataa rahata he
 We were happy only
 hamaara rupaya dollars ko patake bhi detaa he
 The eye also shows
 dollars maane america bhaijan ko aankh maar detaa he
 We said that well done Rupalli
 ham to nahin kar sake tu hi kamaal karte rahio
 But more than this, you did not stop being weak
 do saal pehle jab chunaav kaa maahaul garmaya na to ham dekhe ki rojje log twit kar rahe hai ki aaj bhi rupaya kamazor ho gaya
 Where has the country reached? ham rasaatal main hai ki rupaya 64 par he
 Whoever saw you at 64, felt sitting on the sofa that he had moved from the drawing room to the basement
 ek netaa ne kaha ki kabhi ham dollar ke baraabar the
 One dollar equals one rupee
 ham rupee ko dollar ke baraabar le aayenge
 Then we quickly hit Google what were our beautiful dreams in the days of dollar parity
 jawaab nahin mila
 i do not know when and how in the name of the dollar, you have started shouting here and there
 sunate sunate laga ki agar mulk ko rasaatal main jane se bachaana he ki tumko rupalli kuch karnaa hoga
 Put down the prestige of the country in the morning and evening, eat and drink, stay in my street
 ye main gaanaa likh rahaa hum tumko prerit karne ke liye rupaya
 It seems that you too feel like reaching youth at 64
 isiilie baar-baar vahiin pahunch jate ho kaa
 If we were scholars in mathematics, we would think that by coming to 61, you become strong and when you go to 64, you are weak
 sabzi mandi main koi aalu taul rahaa ho jaise
 Take out a potato, put the pan there and keep one here
 tum thik-thik bataao ki tumko kamazori kab bujhaata he
 At 61 or at 64
 dekho, rupaya, ham tumko pyaar karte hai
 Father is not very brother
 da hole thing inz dait ki sabase bada rupaya
 You have been called the greatest and you are the one who falls
 pite-pate to nahin ho na
 tell
 sarkaar ne nashamukthi par program chalaaya hua he
 If we did not love money, we would not spend day and night like this
 tumhaari khaatir ham kis kis kii khatiradaari main lage hai, tumko maaloom bhi na hoga
 You are not looking at things, you are rolling
 acha hua ki ab log tumhaare girane par hangaamaa nahin karte
 Who does not care about who falls in the circle of who, when and where he falls
 isliye he rupaya tum ho gaye ho senior citijan
 You will also get lower birth in the train
 haada bhi kam lagegaa
 In 63-64 years, people go out on pilgrimage in our village
 tum ho ki 64 ke duaariye par dhimla jate ho ( darvaaze par hi ludhak jate ho)
 Give you vitamins
 bornvita yaa horlix
 Do not worry
 dollars se muqabla chhod do
 Say our words
 kah do duniya se ki ham ‘miself’ main yakeen karte hai
 i am who i am
 wo kamazor hum yaa majboot hum mujhe nahin pataa, main 64 hum to hum
 So don't worry about money
 kaho ki ham apane gir gaye hai
 We are not playing matches with the dollar
 64 ke hone par bharat ko kuch nahin hota he
 e there is no Richter scale that a blow came and all out of the building
 tum giro yaa mat giro hamako kaa he
 Wherever you fall, we reach there without falling
 tum jahaan jaakar chadhe hue kehalaate ho ham to vahaan chadhakar bhi gire hue kehalaate hai
 Have you heard that you go abroad too for a walk and do not come back
 vitt mantri ne kanoon banaaya he ki ab se koi bhi rupaya blike hokar baahar jayega use safed karne ke liye bataanaa padegaa
 It is also heard that you go and hide in a foreign bank
 lukaye lukaye kaala pad jate ho or ihaan jethmalani ji tumko nikaal kar laane ke liye rose court main bahes kar rahe hon
 That's why you go abroad
 kiskaa man nahin karata he videsh main ghoomane ke liye lekin waapas aa jaao
 Like Shahrukh Khan's film Swadesh
 mek in india kaa rupaya videshon main rahe acchhee baat nahin he rupalli
 There are no banks here for you to hide
 kaala hi hona he to videsh main jaakar kyon hote ho
 This is it
 koi roktaa he kaa ji tumko
 The comments tum majboot bano
 Be brave
 ek din dollars tumhaare mukaable giregaa
 You will never fall wo din aa rahaa he
 Before you come, fulfill all your wishes to fall
 kamazor hona koi gunaah nahin hota he
 Rupalli live your life
 lod mat le
 How nice you look in the purse
 tum jab mere paas hote ho to doosraa koi nahin hota
 It is a song but this song has been dedicated to you
 rupalli gaanaa sun
 Have fun
 free mind se life ji
 Being weak and strong does nothing
 isliye he rupaya tum apane maarg par chalo
 Drink pomegranate juice
 magar kamazor mat bano
 Stay 64 or go beyond 64 but stay Indian
 tumhaari kamazori kisi kii siinaajori nahin he
 Your big brother raveesh kumaar Rupalli, can i lovingly call you Rupalli instead of Rs
 chowk-chaubaare par tumhen kitne log rupalli bhi pukaarte hai
 Do not take 'assemble'
 tum kab girte the or kab uchhalte the hamen pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 If a new journalist is created, one of our editors keeps telling us throughout the day that, brothers, the rupee which is the rupee keeps climbing against the dollar
 ham to khush hi ho gaye
 Our rupee also hits the dollar
 aankh bhi dikhaa detaa he
 Dollar believes America kills Bhaijaan
 ham to bole the ki shaabaash rupalli
 We could not do anything but you continue to do wonders
 magar isse zyada tumhaara kamazor hona bujhaata nahin tha
 Two years ago, when the election atmosphere was heated up, neither did we see that Rojje people are tweeting that the rupee has weakened even today
 hai re desh kahaan pahunch gaya
 We are in the abyss that the rupee is at 64
 jo bhi tumko 64 par dekhtaa tha na, sopha par baithe baithe feel karne lagata tha ki drawing room se sarak kar basament main aa gaya he
 One leader said that once we were equal to the dollar
 ek dollars baraabar ek rupaya
 We will bring the rupee equal to the dollar
 tab ham jhat se google maare ki tab dollars kii barabari ke dinon main hamaare haseen sapane kya the
 Did not get an answer
 pataa nahin kab or kaise tum dollars ke naam par kabhi idhar to kabhi udhar dolane lage
 Hearing that, if you want to save the country from going to the abyss, you have to do something rupalli
 desh kii pratishtha ko tum yun na subah shaam giraaya karo, kha pikar date raho, meri gali aayaa karo
 i am writing this song to inspire you
 lagata he ki tum bhi 64 par pahunch javaani jaisaa feel karte ho
 That is why you reach there again and again
 ham ganit main vidwaan rahete to samajhate ki 61 par aate ho to majboot ho jate ho or 64 par jate ho to kamazor
 Like weighing some potatoes in vegetable market
 ek aalu nikaala to palada udhar or ek rakh diya to idhar
 Tell me exactly when your weakness is extinguished
 61 par yaa 64 par
 Look, Rupee, we love you
 baap bada na bhaiya
 The biggest thing that is the biggest rupee
 tumko sabase bada kaha gaya or tum ho ki ludhak jate ho
 You can't be drinking or not
 bataa do
 The government has a program on de-addiction
 rupee se pyaar na karte to ham din raat aise na khatate
 For whose sake we are engaged in the responsibility of whom, you will not even know
 tum ho ki aav dekhe na taav ludhak jate ho
 It is good that now people do not make a ruckus when you fall
 jiskaa thikaana nahin ki kab koun kahaan gir pade uske chakkar main koun pade
 That's why you have become a senior citizen
 train main loar berth bhi milegaa tumko
 The freight will also be less
 63-64 saal main hamaare gaanv main log tirthayatra par nikal jate hai
 You are that you drown at the point of 64 (you roll at the door)
 vitamin den tumko
 Bournvita or Horlicks
 chintaa mat karo
 Quit competing against the dollar
 maan lo hamari baat
 Tell the world that we believe in 'myself'
 main jo hum wo hum
 I'm weak or strong i don't know, I'm 64
 isliye rupaya tum phikar mat karo
 Say that we have fallen
 ham dollars ke saath match khel hi nahin rahe he
 Nothing happens to India when it is 64
 i koi richter scale nahin he ki ek jhatka aayaa or sab building se baahar
 You fall or do not fall belongs to us
 tum jahaan jaakar girte ho ham to vahaan pahunche bina hi gire hue hai
 Wherever you go, you are called climbing and we are said to have fallen there
 sune hai ki tum videsh bhi chale jate ho ghoomane ke liye or jate ho to laut kar nahin aate
 The Finance Minister has made a law that from now on any rupee will go black and will have to be told to turn white
 ye bhi sune hai ki tum videshi bank main luka (chhip) jate ho
 Lukaye Lukaye turns black and here Jethmalani ji is arguing daily in court to get you out
 isliye he rupaya tum videsh jaao
 Who does not feel to roam abroad but come back
 shahrukh khan kii film swadesh kii tarah
 The rupee of Make in India abroad is not a good thing Rupalli
 yahaan bank nahin hai tumhaare chhipane ke liye
 If you want to go black then why do you go abroad
 yahi ho jaao
 Someone stops you
 tippaniyan You be strong vir bano
 One day the dollar will fall against you
 tum kabhi nahin giroge
 That day is coming aane se pehle tum girane kii apni sabhi khwahishen puri kar lo
 Being weak is not a crime
 rupalli tu apni life ji le
 Do not load
 tum purse main tatka-tatka( tazaa) kitna acha lagate ho
 When you are with me, no one else is there
 ye gaanaa he lekin ye gaanaa tumko dedicket kar diye hai
 Listen to the song Rupalli
 mouj kar
 Live the life from free mind
 kamazor or majboot rahane se kuch nahin hota he
 That's why you go on your path
 anaar kaa zeus piyo
 But don't be weak
 64 raho yaa 64 ke paar jaao magar indian bane raho
 Your weakness is not the weakness of anyone

 com / mwy6ymmzpb The women's wing of the Aam Aadmi Party is going to massacre against the increasing stocking incidents in the country's capital Delhi
 mahila wing ke mutabik mahilaon ko apni suraksha ke liye ek sakht kanoon kii jarurat he taaki stocking ko gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh kii shrenee main laayaa ja sake
 In the first phase of mass democracy, the Aam Aadmi Party's women's wing will discuss the issue of women safety and stocking in Anand Vihar on 26 May
 saath hi 'aap' mahila wing nemahilasuraksha ke mudde ko dilli ke har kone tak pahunchane ke liye missd kol campan tahat (8588833565) number bhi jari kiya he
 Richa Pandey Mishra, the chairperson of the women's wing, 'you', a non-bailable offense of stocking, issued a statement saying, 'stalking our sister-daughters by a criminal or a misdemeanor by a man is called stalking
 yah mahilaon ke khilaaf wo pehla kadam he jisko agar shuru main hi ham aap roak den to mahila suraksha ko kaaphi had tak majboot kiya ja saktaa he
 Stalking is a serious anti-social crime that hurts the dignity of women, but society does not take it very seriously
 'richa bataati hai kistokingko lekar police ke bhi haath bandhe hue hai kyonki kanoon hi itnaa kamjor he ki apradhi ko jamaanat par chhodana hi padataa he
 The 'justice Verma Committee', formed after the Nirbhaya case, also recommended stocking to be classified as a non-bailable offense
 'aap' mahila wing kaa maananaa he ki internet or mobile ke daur main stocking ke maamalon main badhotaree ho rahi he
 In such a situation, there is a need for stricter laws against female violence
 'aap' mahila wing ke mutabikstalkingke khilaaf muhim ko majbootee dene ke liye isaki charchaa aam mahilaon ke bich main shuru kii gai or 'hastakshar abhiyaan' evam 'metro campan abhiyaan' shuru kiya gaya he, jiske tahat ek lakh hastakshar hone ke baad is samasya ko grahamantri rajnath singh ke saamne rakhaa jayega

 Mimi Didi When i was a child, i remember i used to play house to house
 ham sharmili dulhanen banate the, hamaare jhuthemooth ke bachche hote the or ham apane patiyon ko chaay sarv karti the
 "" We always believed in the magic of love and hoped that we would one day find ourselves perfect humans
 lekin aaj kuch bhi jhuthemooth nahin he
 i cannot think of a perfect human for him
 main jaanati hum ki nik aap unke parfect hai
 You love them because they love you like crazy
 unki hifaazat karnaa kyonki wo baahar se strong lekin andar se soft hai
 '' Today i witnessed magic and a fairytale
 
 
 When we were kids, mimi didi and i used to play “ghar ghar”
 We would pretend to be shy brides, have imaginary children, and serve tea to our husbands! 🙈🙈 cheesy, but its because we always believed in the magic of love and hoped we would both find that perfect man for us one day !! Today there was no pretending
 i cant think of a more a perfect man for her
 Like i said this morning, there are two ways of judging a human being
 One - travel with them, and two, eat with them
 Nick, i have done both with you
 And so i know you’re perfect for her!! Love her, because she loves you like mad! Protect her, because shes strong, but a soft soul inside
 i love you both and wish you all the happiness forever xxrep 5 ! HAPPY ROKA AND FUTURE WEDDING !! Pri @ priyankachopra @nickjonasa post shared byparineeti Chopra (@parineetichopra) onaug 18, 2018 at 8:00 am PDT Let's say, Priyanka and Nick had a stopped ceremony on Saturday morning

 engiti ne dilli main baahar ke rajyon se aani vaali 10 saal puraani dijal bason par lagaam lagane ke liye darjan bhar rajyon ko in bason ko sienji main badalane ke nirdesh diye he
 In view of the increasing level of pollution in Delhi NCR, the NGT has ordered the state governments of UP, Punjab, Haryana Rajsthan and Himachal Pradesh to convert ten and fifteen year old buses into CNG
 engiti ne sabhi rajya sarkaron ko bason ko sienji main badalane ko lekar apana jawaab dene ke liye ek hafte kaa samay diya he
 Before the Kaushambi Welfare Association put up a petition, the NGT has already ordered a ban on 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol cars in the capital Delhi, although the NGT has given this order on the advice of the Kaushambi Welfare Association
 kaushambi welfare association ne yachika lagaakar engiti se yah maang kii thi ki anand bihar terminal par baahar rajyon se saikadon puraani bason kaa jamaavada laga rahata he, in bason se vaayu pradooshan ke saath-saath dhwani pradooshan bhi hota he
 At the same time, during the last hearing, the NGT had issued a notice to the Delhi government and the UP government to file a reply
 dilli sarkaar ne engiti main kaha tha ki sarkarapradooshanke str ko kam karne ke gadiyon se pani kaa chhidkaav kar rahi he, philhal engiti ne dilli ensiaar main pradooshan ke str ko kam karne ke liye tamaam rajyon ko puraani bason ko sienji main badalane kaa aadesh to de diya he lekin engiti ke is nirdesh kaa sabhi rajya sarkarein paalan kitna karti he, yah ek bada sawaal he
 In the capital Delhi, the case of rape cases is increasing dramatically

 desh kaa to pataa nahin, magar bijepi or narendra modi ke kattar samarthakon main hallaa machaa hua he
 The slogan of Modi for PM is loud
 magar ab sirf naaron se koi desh kaa piem nahin banataa
 Gaya was the era when Indira Gandhi used to climb on the stage wearing a cotton sari and a leather watch in her wrist, correct the pallu before speaking and give the slogan of Garibi Hatao, the public was seen as the Messiah
 magar modi or unki team ye sabit karne main juty he, ki badalte bharat kaa, loktantr kaa aglaa maseehaa vahi hai
 This noise is also fierce in cyberspace outside the party
 magar shor ke pare kuch sawaal hai, das sawaal, jinke jawaab modi samarthakon ko khojane honge
 Narendra Modi can never become the PM of this country without getting over them
 1
 BJP needs 272 seats in the Lok Sabha, 272 is the number which BJP could not achieve even when there was noise of 'abki Bari Atal Bihari' in the country
 1998 or 1999, ye do saal hai, jab centre main vaajapeyi ke netritv main bahumat vaali endie sarkaar bani
 In 1998, BJP contested 388 seats and won 182 seats
 agle saal kargil vijay kii lahar or loksabhaa main ek vot se vishwaas mat khone kii sahanubhuti par savaar vaajapeyi kii sadaarat vaali bijepi ne sahyogiyon ko zyada siten deen
 The BJP contested 339 seats and again won 182 seats
 ab baat karte hai pichley chunaav yani 2009 kii
 In this, BJP won only 116 seats by contesting 433 seats
 ab sawaal ye he ki modi ko agle chunaav main na sirf ye parformens barkaraar rakhni he, balki isamen lagbhag dedh guna ijapha bhi karnaa he
 Which is impossible
 2
 koimodi does not want to come along, the second hurdle in becoming PM is his image and politics
 vaajapeyi piem tabhi ban paae, jab unhone kai rajyon main nae saajheedaar talaashe or endie ke kunbe ko bada, bahut bada kiya
 But in the last year of his tenure, most of the partners fell apart
 tab se ye kunba gata hi he
 Only the Akali Dal, JDU and Shiv Sena are left in it
 endie ke saamne sankat puraane doston ko phir paas laane kaa he
 Modi is said to have good political connections with Jayalalithaa
 magar ammaa ne abhi tak apana rukh saaf nahin kiya
 Naveen Patnaik is also firm on the stand of Ekla Chalo
 nitish kii nafrat jagajaahir he
 Mamta is worried about Muslim voters in Bengal
 kuch nae saajhedaaron kii baat karen to ensipi par karpshan ke beshumaar aarope hai
 The National Conference cannot get out of the lap of Congress because its state has its own politics
 to jab saajheedaar hi nahin milenge, to kya fasebuk par coment modi ko piem bana denge
 3
 santo ghar main jhagada baari, kaise khelen modi pariye das mukhiyon vaala ghar he
 At the moment, even though no one is coming openly in front of Modi, when Advani, Shivraj and the Sangh Parivar also indicate that the Oneman Show will not go on
 sushamaa swaraj jaise netaaon ko lagata he ki ve lagbhag do dashak se centre kii raajnneeti kar rahi hai, maas apil vaali hai or ab jab sheersh pad kii baari ai, to ek rajya kaa chhatrap aakar daawa kar rahaa he
 It is worth noting that Sushma never called Modi the most popular leader of the party
 arun jetali, jo kabhi modi ke chanakya hua karte the, unki hi jadon par mattha daalane main lage hai, magar vakalati shant shaatirapane ke saath
 Rajnath is doing the Modi Anthem, but his existence has developed and flourished in the party
 or in sabase baari, ghar ke bujurg adwani, jo philhal to chup ho gaye, magar chuke nahin ab tak
 There is a long army of disgruntled warriors from Gadkari to Sanjay Joshi to encourage them
 to jab tak modi vaajapeyi kii tarah nirvivaad netaa nahin ban jate apni party ke, to desh ke netaa kaise banenge
 4
 modi hai ki maanate hi nahithish kii baat yaad kariye
 If you want to govern in this country, then avoiding vaccines and caps will not work
 madhya pradesh ke siem shivaraj singh chouhan ye baat jaanate hai
 Eid meets, visits the Hajis, gets them married at government expense
 magar modi hai ki maanate hi nahin
 He then made it clear that instead of changing his image among Muslims, he believed more in strengthening the image of strict administrator
 vajah chaahe dange hon, chaahe chhavi, sach ye he ki is desh kaa muslim modi kaa naam sunate hi chaukanna ho jaataa he
 Most feel that if Modi comes, the entire country will become Gujarat for him
 har vakt dar kaa saaya hoga or shaq bhari nigahen
 Therefore, it is decided that as soon as Modi's claim is announced, Muslim voters across the country should work on only one agenda, beat Modi
 jo jahaan bijepi ko haraata dikhe, use ekatarfa vot do
 If this happens, BJP will only win hands
 5
 Not in Uttar Pradesh, the party has a sinking of bjp's loot in Uttar Pradesh after 1998
 kalyaan singh siem the or rajnath singh unki raah main har mumkin kanta bo rahe the
 Kalyan became so isolated that after a year he started defeating his party as CM
 natiznat party ke 58 saansad ghatakar 38 rah gaye
 Kalyan was subsequently expelled from the party and Rajnath became CM after Ramprakash Gupta
 khub elaan kiye, daawey kiye magar upi vidhansabha main party kii siten ghatakar 88 rah gayi
 Rajnath came to the center as a minister and in the 2004 elections, the BJP lost even more
 ab haal ye he ki party dahaad ke aankade tak pahunchane ke liye tarasati he upi main
 This 80-seat province used to claim that we run the country, it used to get power from these numbers
 magar upi main bijepi abhi bhi khastahal he
 There is a lot of old leaders here, who will win if they win their seats
 sab ek duusare ko set karne main lage rahete hai
 In such a situation, when there is no answer to the politics of Uttar Pradesh, then the Delhi Durbar will remain just a dream
 6
 Meets in the South The party simply loves the word UBBJP South
 vaicharik bahason main ise kehete bhi dakshinpanthi yani rhite wing party hai
 But there is nothing right for the BJP in the south of the country
 kerala main kabhi khaataa hi nahin khulaa
 The entire country witnessed the scandal in Karnataka
 andhra pradesh main bandaaru dattatreya jaise jamini netaaon ko kinare laga venkaiya naidu jaise dilli brands netaa badaye gaye
 TDP as a partner went and seats went in interest
 tamilnadu main jab bhi panpi, saajhedaar ke kandhe par nasahni tikaakar
 Right now the party is empty handed here
 is blank ke chalate bijepi uttar bharat ke rajyon main kitna bhi acha pradarshan kar le, na to pan india party ban paaegi or na hi apane dam dilli par dastak de paaegi
 7
 vanamen sho ke chalate nahin chalegaa gathbandhan or nitiyanmodi samarthak kahenge ki puraa vishleshan nakaaratmak he or na par tikega
 Let us adopt a yes and assume that Modi will bring profits to the BJP as well as gather allies and also get power
 tab sawaal uthta he ki satta paane ke baad or usase bhi zyada mushkil hota he saajhedaaron ke saath satta chalaanaa
 Vajpayee learned its lesson after two stumbles
 1996 main to shapath lene ke baad saajhedaar hi nahin mili or 13 din main istipha dena padaa
 Got majority in 1998 and government lasted 13 months
 phir subramanyam swami kii chaay party hui, ammaa sonia se milin or shiraja bikhar gaya
 After this, the party lost at the turn of manipulation and lost one vote in the trust vote
 ye sabak hi the, jo vaajapeyi ko 1999 main yaad rahe or tamaam mushkilon ke baad bhi unka lacheela rajanyik ravaiya safal rahaa or saajhedaar vishwaas mat sa sankat paidaa nahin kar paae
 But Modi is a one-man show
 sakht hai, lacheele nahin
 Could not take the people of his party with him, how will he keep the colleagues who change politics according to the needs of the state
 8
 There was no experience of parliamentary politics at all
 ab aate hai is shaks par, jiskaa naam he narendra modi
 Vajpayee reached Parliament for the first time in the fifties
 upi ke balrampur se
 Remained in Parliament until 2004, except for a few breaks
 adwani ko bhi dashakon kaa sansadeey anubhav he
 The same can be said of sushma-jaitley and other central leaders
 magar narendra modi, unhone to sansad ko sirf darshak ddeergha se hi dekha he
 Maneuvering of Parliamentary Sands, floor management and reversal of debates are not as easy as addressing the rally
 modi ko sansadeey raajnneeti kaa bilkul bhi anubhav nahin he, ye baat unke betarah khilaaf jaati he
 Because the question is not just to sit in Parliament, but also to understand its complexities
 yahaan unhen beuroperesi nahin saathiyon par bharosa karnaa hoga, jinke paas lanbaa anubhav he
 His experience can also fill fear within Modi
 9
 Kyanarendra Modi is the lion of Gujarat, who won somewhere outside Gujarat
 unke samarthak hi nahin, ham bhi ye maanate hai
 After all, winning three consecutive assembly elections is no joke
 magar is soobe ke baahar kya
 Has the BJP been able to gain power in any other state on Modi's power, what will it be able to do
 is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin
 Talking about the coming elections soon, BJP in Rajasthan is not trusting of Vasundhara Modi
 alaakaman ne unhen free hand diya he or vah rajya main dakhal pasand nahin karengi
 Shivraj does not consider himself inferior to Modi
 dow
 Raman Singh is also more or less the CM since Modi
 dilli ek aisa rajya he, jahaan modi khulkar khel sakate hai apane pattey
 But you are here to spoil the work
 ye to rahi vidhansabha chunaavon kii baat
 There is an even bigger field in the Lok Sabha to be cut
 modi ko piem ke taur par project karne vaale bataaen ki isse pehle unhone kab kisi loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti taiyaar kii or kii to usamen kitne safal rahe
 10
 dangon kaa daagdaman se nahin hataa ab takaur ab us par baat, jisko sunate hi modi bhakton kaa beepi bad jaataa he
 Gujarat riots stain
 unke apane piem vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki rajdharm nibhaayaa janaa chahie
 Modi went ahead with the riots in Gujarat, but the country remembers that till date he has never said openly that what happened in Gujarat should not have happened
 rajya sarkaar ko dangaiyon ko sakhti se kuchalanaa chahie tha
 Instead, during the Gujarat riots, the protesters have been seen to shore up one by one
 na chaude hone se kuch hoga, na chup rahane se
 Because Aaj Tak demands Congress to calculate the 1984 riots
 sikh aaj bhi bhadak uthte hai
 Even if the same Congress made a Sikh the PM for the first time
 modi dangon ko daag hi nahin maanate, us par maafee kya maangenge or jab tak dange unki chaaya se chipke hai, chunavi dangal main ek daanv kam hi rahegaa unka

 "the work of Dinesh's work was somewhat mitigated by Santosh Patel, the internationally acclaimed runner of his village
 santosh ke suzav par dinesh ne bhaalaa thro or besabaal kii taiyaari kerani shuru kar di
 Dinesh had found a way, but the floor was still far away and this path was not easy at all
 bina kisi saadhan or suvidhaon ke dinesh din-raat mehnat karte the
 His grandmother and villagers are witnesses of his hard work
 unhone ekadam subah uthakar or der raat tak dinesh ko khel kaa abhyaas karte dekha he
 At that time, no one could even imagine that this small boy who grew up in a poor family in a small village would one day write such a success story
 haalanki gaanv main rahakar khelon kii taiyaari karne vaale khiladinnon ke saamne aarthik samasya ek bahut badi baadha banati he or dinesh bhi isse achoote nahin rahe
 Dinesh said, “whenever i had to go to participate in a sports competition, i always thought of money
 meri jeb main bilkul paise nahin hote the
 The family also did not have enough resources to help me
 iske alaava jab bhi kit vagairah lene kii jarurat padati to musiibat khadi ho jaati thi
 "dinesh's problems were largely solved in 2004 when he was selected at Sports College Lucknow (guru Govind Singh Sports College)
 dinesh kehete hai, “shuru-shuru main main is baat ko lekar pareshaan tha ki kis tarah se apana naam sports college main likhvaauun
 It was not easy to get admission there, but i felt that once the admission is received, the way forward will definitely be easier
 ”dinesh kii kismat ke daravaaje 2007 main tab khule jab florida, america kii seven figure naamak company trial ke liye bharat ai
 Dinesh was first in trials in Lucknow and Delhi, but Dinesh finished second in the finals held in Mumbai
 pratham sthaan praapt karne vaale rinku ke saath pratiyogita main behatar karne vaale or aayojakon ko apane kshamta-pradarshan se aakarshith karne vaale dinesh kaa bhi chayan kar liya gaya
 "I was number one when the ball crossed the boundary, but according to the scale drawn by the organizers, i could not hit the ball at the right place," says Dinesh in an upbeat tone
 meri bajaae rinku ko kam duuri par hi gend phenkane ke baavjood sahi jagah par ball maarane par pratham chun liya gaya
 But due to my good performance, the organizers also selected me along with Rinku
 dinesh or uske parivaaravaalon ke liye yah bahut badi uplabdhi thi
 What about his village and family, he was the first person from all over the country to contract with such a large sports club in America
 america jane ke teen-chaar maheene ke andar hi dinesh kaa kontract vahaan ke prasiddh besabaal club pittsburg pyrets ke liye ho gaya
 Then what was the name of Dinesh in the world of American baseball
 is babat dinesh kehete hai, “do saal ke liye hue is kontract ke baad maine janaa ki besabaal sachmuch kya cheez he
 i did not see all the equipment related to this game and all the facilities for preparation in my entire life
 ”dinesh bharat or america ke sheersh khelon or us par milane vaali suvidhaon ke antar ke bare main kehete hai, “america main jitani suvidhaayen is dauraan milin utani suvidha shaayad main samajhataa hum yahaan cricket vagairah jaise khelon main bhi khiladinnon ko nahin milti hai, jo yahaan kaa pramukh khel he
 If i say, the President here will get the same facilities as the players there
 vahaan par har maheene 60-70 hajaar ru
 Used to meet iske alaava khaane-pine, rahane, aane-jane ke liye alag se paisa miltaa tha
 "after a two-year contract with the American Baseball Club, he returned to the village and was then sent to China by the same American club for two months
 do maah ke liye 20 april, 2012 ko dinesh ko china ke emelbi centre bheja gaya
 According to Dinesh, he was given the responsibility of going there and getting people to play this game
 china kii yatra se do hafte pehle laute dinesh neshnal game kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai jo agle 10 maheene baad hone hai
 Dinesh Patel is saddened that the government adopts a dual policy with sports played in India
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar sabhi khelon ko samaan mahatv dene ke bajaae unke saath bhedbhaavpurn vyavhaar karti he
 In Patel's words, "the government has money and schemes for some sports only
 jabaki jarurat is baat kii he ki sarkaar ko sabhi khelon ko badhaava dene ke liye yojanaayen banani chahie
 "her grandmother, Kalavati, feels very proud of her grandson today, but there was a time when she was angry at Dinesh, who was immersed in sports all the time
" is dauraan jab unhen raat ko ghar aane main der hoti to nani kii daant khaani padati
 His grandmother probably feared that his beloved is going on the wrong path
 ve kahati hai, “jab dinesh raat ko let aata to kaaphi gussa aata tha or khub daantati thi
 But today i am proud of Dinesh
 ”dinesh main kaabiliyat or kuwwat he, magar jarurat is baat kii he ki hamaari sarkaron kii inayat aise khiladinnon par ho jo keechad main camel ke phool ke samaan hai
 Many young celebrities attended the eighth India Today Conclave
 sabane ek sur main kaha ki badlaav jaruri he or ham ye badlaav laakar rahenge
 Bollywood's famous actor Shah Rukh Khan said that art can act as an ointment on the wounds of hate
 kya sochataa he aaj kaa yuva, kis baat par dhadkta he uskaa dil, kya taiyaar he wo badalte vakt kii chunautiyon se jujhane ke liye
 On the second day of the India Today Conclave, it was the turn of young celebrities from different fields to express their views on these issues
 bhartiya cinema jagat main aaj ke sabase bade sitare shahrukh khan ne apni baat kii shuruyaat usee andaaj main hi kii jiske liye wo jane jate hai yani logon kaa manoranjan
 Whether art can kill hate - Shah Rukh was very serious on this question and he clearly said that this can be possible only when the efforts are made honestly and continuously
 shahrukh ne kaha ki mumbai par aatanki hamale ke baad filmi sitaron kii tarah hamanen apni suraksha badha lee lekin ye saaf ho gaya he ki ab koi bhi jagah surakshit nahin
 Much is happening in the world and we should encourage how art can act as a helpful bridge between hatred and evil
 shahrukh ke pehle bahes is baat par chal rahi thi ki kya aaj kaa noujvaan badalte vakt kii chunautiyon se jujhane ke liye taiyaar he? raishumaari ke is daur main film abhinetri priyanka chopra ne ye sabit kar diya ki wo aaj kii noujvaan soch kii behtareen numaayinda hai
 Priyanka said, 'if i am saying something that matters to people, then it should be given importance
 main apni saamaajik jimmedaari ko gambhirtha se leti hum
 i am not a leader but i am the voice of today's young generation, whose mind has thousands of thoughts and millions of views
 ' manch par jab olympic ke sunahare sitare abhinav bindra kii baari aayi to cricket ke alaava baaki khelon kii badahaali kaa dard chhalak aayaa
 Bindra said, 'I talk about the Olympic Games
 hamaare cricketer hamaare behtareen rajdoot he lekin cricket duniya ke adhiktar deshon tak nahin pahunchataa
 Hence the importance of the Olympic Games
 olympic khel desh kii garima badhaane main ahm he
 While Priyanka was expecting new thinking in the new era, Farhan Akhtar, who gave films like 'dil Chahta Hai' and 'rock On', was troubled by the growing insensitivity of people and the mindset of taking up the law
 raajnneeti kii noujvaan jamaat ke sitare or mantri jitin prasad is bharose ke saath dikhe ki mulk main badlaav naujavaanon ke jariye hi mumkin ho sakegi
 It is a matter of fact that during this time he made a strong reference to Rahul Gandhi
