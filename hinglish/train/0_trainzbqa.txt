 When he was going to open and i number three
 ham donon pad pahan kar baithe hote
 i used to go to him and say that if Viru Tu stays on the pitch for the first 20 overs, then we will win the match
 tu pehla paanch over sirf roak le
 No captain would have told an opener in the powerplay to stop the first five overs
 wo kehete, haa thik he
 But on the pitch, he used to do what he has seen
 ’jab lagaataar chauke maarthe rahe sahvagaganguli ne aage kaha, ‘lords main jab hamane 325 ran kaa peechha kiya to ham donon ne hi opening kii
 i was very angry at break time
 maine kaha teen final haar chuke hai
 325 Done
 ye final bhi haath se nikal jayega or england kii gendbaaji bahut acchhee thi
 Flintoff, Hoggard, Gough, Caddick
 maine kaha ki lords main 325 chej karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Both of us were going to bat, so i was going forward in the field beating that whistle
 maine kaha ki teen final haar chuke hai or tu siti maare ja rahaa he
 i said that both of us have to open and make runs, so he said don't worry, we are winning this match
 maine kaha chal thik he batting karte hai
 "I will send it directly to India," Ganguly added, "after that it started well
 ham 6 kii ausat se adhik par khel rahe the
 i told Viru that the start has been good, if both of us stand up to 20 overs then the score will be around 160 and we will make the rest because the wicket is good
 maine kaha ki roni irani daalega udhar se tu zyada mat maarna
 If a four was found in an over, then it was okay
 single lekar ham saat-aath bana lenge
 Viru said don't worry
 main non striker and par khadaa tha
 When the first ball was put on the Iranian half volley, Veeru hit it four with a cover drive
 ball half woli par thi isliye maine kuch kaha nahin veeru ko
 i called him well plaid
 agali gend middle stump par thi
 He sat down and hit the boundary on the sweep
 maine kaha dekh aath ran ban gaye hai ab sanbhal kar khel
 Third he went to sweep again but was out of the ball off stump and then played in slip
 phir chaar
 i then said that you should play straight
 lekin agali hi gend jo middle stump par thi usne flik kiya or scawair leg ke upar se boundry
 After that i did not see him
 kaha ki tuje jo karnaa he wo kar lekin agar out ho gaya to lords se sidhaa india bhej duungaa tu hotel nahin ja paaegaa
 'inzamam was afraid of Sehwag! Ganguly then spoke about Viru's triple century on the tour of Pakistan
 unhone kaha, ‘multan main 300 vaali pari ke dauraan maine unase kaha ki dekho bada score bananaa he
 So that tells me that i have decided that i will hit a six at 190
 do sau pahunch gaya to phir chakka marunga
 i said that you have gone mad
 pakistan main khel rahaa he
 Is the first series
 toss jitkar ham 350 par do wicket hai ham test match jeet jaaenge to acha hoga
 He said don't worry
 lekin 194 par usne chakka jad diya
 Three hundred were also made by hitting them with six
 isse pehle usne apana shatak bhi chakke se hi banaaya
 Veeru used to do the same by winning a six with the last ball like Dhoni
 ’injamaam ne kaha, ‘mujhe is player se dar lagata tha ki ye uthaa ke to martha tha lekin boundry se baahar

 How should be the Prime Minister of this country
 kya upie sarkaar se sab khush hai
 How angry is the public against inflation, who is the biggest responsible for rising inflation
 aaj agar chunaav ho jaaen to kis karavat baithegaa oont
 These are many questions, which frequently arise in the mind of every Indian
 aaj tak lekar aayaa he aise hi chubte sawaalon ke jawaab
 The answers that the public has given
 india today, asi nilsan or oarji-maarg ne logon ke bich jaakar ye survey taiyaar kiya he
 Looking at the survey, it seems that Rahul is now ruling the hearts of the people
 lekin, manmohan singh kaa graph buree tarah gira he
 People were asked who would be the Prime Minister of India of your dreams
 jo jawaab mili, wo rahul kii badhati lokapriyata ko saaf-saaf dikhaate hai
 In his favor, 29 per cent of the people cast their votes
 pichley saal ke survey kii tulana main lokapriyata kii ye badhotaree 21 fisadi he
 Not so much, as popular as any
 survey ke mutabik, pichley saal bhar main manmohan singh kii chhavi logon ke dilon main kaaphi dhoomil hui he
 In response to the favorite pm's question, Manmohan Singh's graph has fallen badly
 pichley saal wo logon ke sabase pasandida pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar the
 But this time he is at the bottom of this category
 isbaar to 1 fisadi logon ne hi unhen piem kaa acha ummidavaar mana
 The most surprising thing that has come out in this survey is that Atal Bihari Vajpayee is still very popular in a large section of the country
 naa wo piem kii res main hai or naa wo ab chunaav ladane vaale hai
 Even then, in this survey people consider him as the second best candidate as PM
 india today ke is salanaa survey main desh or desh ke logon se judi kai ahm baaten saamne ai hai
 But, such a big change in people's choice for the highest chair of electoral democracy is a big sign
 pasandida pradhanmantri ke sawaal par manmohan rahul se to pichde hi
 The most surprising thing is that he is behind many leaders of the rest of the country
 had ye he ki narendra modi, adwani or mayawati ko log manmohan singh se zyada behatar piem maanate hai
 When people were asked questions on Manmohan Singh's performance, the answers were shocking
 2009 ke survey kii tulana main unke liye har achche jawaab kii maatra ghat gai he
 Yes, there has been a huge increase in the number of people who consider him a bad PM
 saal 2009 main jahaan sirf 7 fisadi log unhen kharaab piem maanate the
 This year 22 percent of the people have lost their trust
 jab logon se pichley ek saal main upie sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main poocha gaya to 39 fisadi logon ne ise ausat kaha or 26 fisadi ne kharaab
 Meaning if you add the average and the bad, then the figure becomes 65 per cent
 hamane sawaal poocha ki pichley saal bhar main jindagi kisi badali he
 54 per cent of the people said that as it is
 30 fisadi ne badtar bataaya
 Overall 84 per cent of the people are not feeling anything
 ab baat us jaadu kii jo rahul gandhi ne chalaaya he
 The biggest question is which hearts Rahul Gandhi is ruling the most
 jawaab bataate hai ki rahul ne har dil par jaadu kiya he
 Men or women
 rahul gandhi unki pehali pasand hai
 Talking about youth, 32 percent of people between 18 and 24 years want Rahul
 25 se 44 umrvarg main bhi rahul ko chaahane vaale sabase zyada he
 The most shocking figure came from the responses of people in rural and urban areas
 rahul kaa jaadu donon ilaakon main baraabar chalaa he
 When the same question was asked of Hindu, Muslim and Christian people, then people of Muslim and Christian class like them the most
 hindu varg main bhi wo sabase pasandida netaa hai
 In this survey conducted from 26 June 2010 to 15 July 2010 in 19 states of the country, 12 thousand 392 voters of 98 Lok Sabha constituencies have been sampled

 May they not be, people still remember them
 wo rahen naa rahen, log unke kaam ko kabhi bhul nahin pate
 Strong decisions, solid intentions, bold action
 indira gandhi par bhale hi immergency kii taanaashaahee ke aarope lagate rahe hon
 But, people even today say that PM is like Indira
 survey main poocha gaya ki ab tak desh kaa sabase acha piem koun rahaa he
 The highest 31 per cent of people responded to Indira Gandhi's rights
 duusare number par rahe atal bihari vaajapeyi
 The current Prime Minister got the least 7 percent votes
 matlab saaf he ki ye public he, jo sab jaanati he
 It knows that big and important decisions have to be made by sitting in the Prime Minister's chair
 muddon ko sirf taalane se kaam nahin chalata
 People have to take some tough decisions to rule the heart of the people
 or isiilie to indira gandhi aaj bhi aam logon ke jehan main basii hui hai

 Lucknow, situated on the banks of the Gomti River in Uttar Pradesh, is called the city of Nawabs
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat par lambey samay se bijepi kaa kabja rahaa he saath hi purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii bhi raajnneetik karmbhumi rahi he
 In the current era, veteran BJP leader and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who is holding Atal's political legacy, has once again landed in the political battleground of Lucknow
 rajnath ke khilaaf sapa ne haal hi bijepi chhodkar congress main shaamil hue shatrughna sinha kii patni punam sinha or congress ne acharya pramod krishnam ko utarkar lakhanu kii raajnneetik ladaai ko dilachasp bana diya he
 However, all three main political party candidates are from outside Lucknow
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 It has been consistently occupied by the BJP since 1991
 sapa or basapa is seat par aaj tak apana khaataa bhi nahin khol saki hai
 Rajnath has again contested from Lucknow seat
 mangalvaar ko unhone namakan patr daakhil kiya
 Rajnath Singh is originally from Chandauli
 sapa ne kysth matadaataaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue punam sinha par daanv khelaa he
 Poonam Sinha hails from Patna, Bihar and is living in Mumbai
 vahiin, congress ne brahman or muslim sameekaran ke jariye rajnath ko maat dene ke liye acharya pramod krishnam par bharosa jataayaa he
 But penetrating the fort of BJP is not so easy for the opposition
 pramod krishnam upi ke sanbhal ke rahane vaale hai
 Former Prime Minister Atal Vihari Vajpayee won the Lucknow parliamentary seat continuously from 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2004
 vaajapeyi ko lakhanu main na to rajbabbar maat de sake, na hi mujffar ali or na hi raja karn singh
 In 2009, Lal Ji Tandon from BJP won the election by winning the election from this seat
 vaajapeyi ke tarj par hi raajnneetik sameekaran ko sadhakar rajnath singh ne 2014 ke siyaasi jang ko fatah kiya tha or congress kii reeta bahuguna joshi ko kareeb paune teen lakh voton se maat di thi
 Actually Rajnath Singh has his own image behind having a strong hold in Lucknow
 iskaa nateeja he ki hinduon ke saath-saath muslim matadaataaon ne bhi badi taadaad main unke paksh main pichley chunaav main vot kiya tha
 The result of this was that both the SP and Congress parties could not succeed in uniting Muslim votes in their favor
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhen to badi aabaadi muslim samudaay kii he
 Muslim 20 per cent, Scheduled Castes 14
 5 fisadi, brahman 8 fisadi, rajput 7 fisadi, obisi 28 fisadi, vaisya 10 or anya 12 fisadi matadaata hai
 The Lucknow parliamentary seat has five assembly seats and all are currently occupied by the BJP
 rajnath singh ko is baar lakhanu ke ran main gherne ke liye sapa or congress ne bada daanv khelaa he
 SP has landed his wife Poonam Sinha to cash in on Shatrughan Sinha's stardom
 punam sinha ke upar sabase badi jimmedaari lakhanu ke kysth matadaataaon ke dil jeetne kii hogi, jo maujuuda samay main bijepi ke paramparaagat voter hai
 Apart from this, Lucknow is completely new to him and is not fully aware of the SP-BSP workers
 aise main unhen jamini str kai kathinaayeeyon se jujhna pad saktaa he
 Apart from this, SP and BSP have never been able to win this seat
 aise main is seat par sapa ke khaataa kholane kii jimmedaari unke kandhon par he
 Acharya Pramod Krishnam contested from Sambhal seat in 2014 as a Congress candidate
 lekin jeet nahin sake hai
 Pramod Krishnam has a very good image among Muslims
 iske chalate lakhanu sansadeey seat par congress ne unhen utaara he
 In such a situation, it will be a challenge to practice Muslim voters as well as Brahmin voters
 pramod krishnam agar is sameekaran ko banane main kaamyaab rahete hai to bijepi kii raah main baadha ban sakate hai

 'team' means the group that works together, but these days 'team India' is just becoming Virat Kohli and Mohammed Shami
 haalia dinon main aap dekhen to bharat kii taraf se agar koi lagaataar acha pradarshan karne main kaamyaab ho paaya he, to wo sirf kohli or shami hai
 In 2013, Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma played well and all three also scored more than one thousand runs last year
 isi ke dam par bharat ranking main bhi number ek kii kursi par bhi virajman rahaa
 But by the end of the year Rohit and Dhawan's bats had lost their luster
 or ab team india kaa number van kaa taj bhi khatre main pad gaya he, kyonki udhar australia england kii lagaataar dhunaai kar rahaa he
 Even in South Africa, there were lions of their own land, from the last South Africa tour to the first ODI in New Zealand, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, r Ashwin, Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar have all flopped
 dakshin africa main bharat teen main se do match haar gaya or tisare main indradevataa ne haar se bachaa liya
 The New Year also started in New Zealand with a loss
 dakshin africa main rohit ne 3 maichon kii 2 pariyon main mahaj 37 ran banaae, shikhar dhawan 3 maichon kii 2 pariyon main 12 ran, suresh raina 3 maichon kii 2 pariyon main 50 ran or captain mahendra singh dhoni ne 3 maichon kii 2 pariyon main 84 ran banaae
 Yuvraj also played in 2 matches, where he could not open an account in an innings
 gendbaajon kii baat karen to mohammad shami hi ek maatr aise gendbaaj rahe jinhone sabko prabhavit kiya or kul 3 maichon main 9 wicket jatke, baaki ke sabhi flop sabit hue
 What is the rest of the bowlers and batsmen in the team? In the New Zealand series in the new year everyone expected that India will do something good there but the way it started there is very disappointing
 pehali baat to ye ki kya bharat ke paas mohammad shami ke alaava koi or gendbaaj nahin jo team ko safalataa dilaa sake? shami ne pehle spel main bharat ko 2 wicket dilaae, lekin jaise hi ve gendbaaji se hate bhartiya gendbaaj wicket lene ko taras gaye or ken williamsan or ross tailor ne tisare wicket ke liye 121 ran jod daale
 The question arises that if Shami dropped 2 wickets to 32 from New Zealand, then what is the other bowler of the team? This was not only in Napier ODI but also in South Africa
 ballebaaji main bhi fail hui team indiaballebaaji kii baat karen to or bhi niraashaa hoti he
 Gautam Gambhir does not even get a place in the probables of the World Cup, but on the other hand, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are now proving to be match by match flop
 kohli ke alawa koi aisa ballebaaj najar nahin aa rahaa he jo bharat ke liye niyamit rup se har paristhiti main ran bana sake
 There was never a middle-order of India, but in 2013 at least India was winning the match due to its top order (rohit, Virat and Dhawan) and lower middle-order (dhoni), but now it is not the same
 agar najar he vishwa cap par, to bahut jald leni hogi seekhnapier vanade ke baad captain dhoni apane gendbaajon kii tarif isliye kii, kyonki unhone newjiland ko 300 ran banane nahin die
 Are the bowlers of Team India, who gave 292 runs and are craving for one wicket, deserve praise for just this much? Where did the thinking of the captain who was never satisfied after the victory? Where did the captain's never-ending hunger that was never erased for victory? Learn from mistakes, Team India
 The most important thing that Dhoni has to do is that what kind of team on New Zealand soil should he take to the field again Need to think
 captain ko kab samaj aayega ki newjiland main 2 spinner kisi kaam ke nahin
 No one understood why Ashwin was fed, it would have been better for the team if Stuart Binny had been replaced in place of Ashwin, because in New Zealand, you need players who like fast bowling as well as the bat

 saath hi agar bharat is siries ko agle saal vishwa cap kii taiyaari ke rup main le rahaa he, to bahut jald bharat ko suresh raina ke vikalp ke bare main bhi sochna hoga

 prabodh bhi hira ke bade kaarobaari hai auki unki company kaa naam he jembal group
 Together these four people created such a spade of trusts and companies abroad through which crores of tax was stolen
 yani ye wo log hai jinka kaala dhan videshon main padaa hua he
 These four are among the 25 people whose names have been given by the German government to the Indian government
 ajtak ke paas un accounts auki companiyon kaa kaccha chittha he jinaki aad main inlogon ne karodon kaa kalaadhan chipa rakhaa he
 Now understand their game
 mehta bandhuon ne dred or dinis foundations naam ke do trust banaae or in treston ke naam ek ke baad ek kai companiyon kholte gayi
 The allegation is that with the intention of tax evasion, these people chose the countries and places for their companies and trusts which are considered heaven for tax evasion
 inhi main lagjemberg bhi shaamil he
 The Mehta brothers sold their dynasty foundation company Sharp Edge to a Chinese company for thirty-five million dollars and there is no mention of such a huge amount

 input bhashaa se If you want to introduce Phoolan Devi, there is no one word or sentence
 ek das saal kii ladki, jo apane baap kii jameen ke liye ladi
 Then the girl-bride and her middle-aged husband raped her
 baad main daaku shriram thakur ke giroh ne uski izzat luti
 Later, Phoolan Devi became a dangerous bandit and shot 22 people in line in Behmai village
 aatmasarman kiya
 Got out of jail and became a politician
 sansad pahunchi or phir uski hatya kar di gai
 Today is the birthday of the same Goddess
 jaaniye unke jivan se judi aisi ghatnaayen, jo aapako jhakzor kar rakh dengi
 Phoolan was born on 10 August 1963 in 'ghura Ka Purva' of Jalaun in UP
 garib or ‘choti jati’ main janmi phulan main dabbupan nahin tha
 He had heard from his mother that uncle had grabbed his land
 das saal kii umr main chachaa se bhid gai
 Staged for land
 sajaa to milani hi thi
 She was married at the age of 10
 adhed umr ke pati ne shaadi kii pehali raat se uske saath darindagi shuru kar di, jo lambey samay tak chali
 The man raped Phoolan
 phir ye roj kaa silsilaa ban gaya
 Due to which her health deteriorated and she had to come to her maternal home, the husband got married again
 phir kismat ne ek or karavat lee
 During this time new friends of Phoolan were formed
 jinamein se kuch daaku the
 According to Phoolan, this was the fate approved
 giroh kaa sardaar babu gujjar use chahta tha
 At the same time, the robber Vikram Mallah was also in love with Phoolan
 vikram or babu ke bich phulan ko lekar aisi tanatani hui ki ek din vikram ne uski hatya kar di or giroh kaa sardaar ban gaya
 Now Phoolan and Vikram started living together
 phir kya tha, ek din phulan apane giroh ke saath pati ke gaanv gai
 There she beat both husband and his wife fiercely
 udhar, daakuon kaa ek or gang tha thakur giroh
 Whose kingpin was Shriram Thakur and Lala Thakur
 ye donon babu gujjar kii hatya se naaraaz the, jiskaa jimmedaar phulan ko mana jaataa tha
 a fight broke out between the two groups
 thakur giroh or vikram mallaah giroh ke bich khooni jhadap hui
 While hiding, Phoolan and Mallah sat down for a while
 usee raat phulan or mallaah ke bich sambandh bane
 The two were with each other when they slept, but Phoolan Thakur was in the grip of the gang when they woke up
 unhone ne vikram mallaah ko markar phulan ko kidanap kar liya tha
 In his book, Phoolan mentions a woman named Kusum, who took all the flowers of Phoolan from her body
 phulan ne likhaa tha, 'kusum ne mere kapade faad die or aadamiyon ke saamne nanga chhod diya'
 The Thakur gang tied him in ropes naked and took him to the village of Behmai by the river
 jahaan use puure gaanv main nanga ghumaya gaya
 After that Shriram Thakur was the first to rape her
 phir baari-baari se gaanv ke logon ne uski izzat luti thi
 They were holding him by hair and pulling him
 phulan ko laathiyon se bhi khub maaraa gaya tha
 The Thakurs are said to have kept Phoolan in a naked state for more than two weeks
 phulan ek bandhak thi
 He was gang-raped every day
 tab tak jab tak vah behosh nahin ho jaati
 At the time this vandalized Phoolan was only 18 years old
 yahaan se chhootane ke baad phulan daakuon ke gang main phir shaamil ho gai
 Phoolan returned to Behmai village in 1981
 usne un do logon kii pahchaan kii, jinhone uskaa rape kiya tha
 When asked about the rest, nobody told anything
 phulan ne gaanv se 22 thakuron ko nikaalkar ek saath goli maar di thi
 It was this massacre that made Phoolan's image a dreaded dacoit
 chaaron ore bavaal cat gaya
 The media renamed Phoolan as 'bandit Queen'
 sarkaar kii pahal par bhind ke espi rajendra chaturvedi phulan ke giroh se baat karte rahe
 It was his miracle that Phoolan agreed to surrender
 madhya pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri arjuna singh ke saamne usnesarenderkia
 At that time he was charged with 22 murders, 30 robberies and 18 kidnappings
 phulan ko 11 saal jail main rahanaa padaa
 Mulayam Singh's government decided in 1993 to withdraw all charges against him
 raajnneetik rup se ye bada faisla tha
 Phoolan escaped from jail in 1994
 ummed singh se unki shaadi ho gai
 After this Phoolan entered politics
 1996 main phulan devi ne samaajawaadee party se chunaav ladaa or jeet gayi
 Became MP from Mirzapur
 chambal main ghoomane vaali ab dilli ke ashoka road ke shandaar bangale main rahane lagi
 She lost in 1998, but again won in 1999
 25 july 2001 ko sher singh rana phulan se milane aayaa
 On the day of Nagpanchami, he ate kheer with his hand and then shot Phoolan at the gate of the house
 phulan kii hatya ke baad rana ne kaha tha ki usne behamai cond kaa badla liya he
 On 14 August 2014, a Delhi court sentenced Sher Singh Rana to life imprisonment
 aaj navaratri kaa pehla din he
 Mother Shailputri is worshiped before Durga on the first day
 dilli samet puure ensiaar main navaratri ko lekar khaasaa utsaah he
 Arrangements were made for the convenience and safety of the devotees throughout the day and night by decorating the temples
 dilli main chhatarpur or jhandevalaan mandir main subah se bhakton kii qatari maa ke darshan ke liye jute gayi he
 Keeping in view the rising prices and security of household items, Delhi housewives were witness to change on one hand and on the other hand they kept their eyes on TV sets while completing their daily work
 inamen zyaadaatar mahilaayein jo kabhi dilli main shila dikshit ke shasankaal ke samay kishoravastha main thim ve behad utsukata se tivi set par nazren gadaaye parinaamon ko dekh rahi thim
 Security and increasing household budget was the main issue in the minds of most women in the polling held on December 4

 Earlier, Congress MLA Narmada Prasad Prajapati was elected as the Speaker of the 15th Assembly of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday

 ab passport do tarah ke rang vaali jacket ke saath jari kiye jaaenge

 vahiin jin aavedakon ko imigration check kii jarurat nahin (non-ecr) hogi, unhen abhi kii tarah hi nile rang kii jacket vaali passport bocolate jari kii jaati rahegi
 Another important change that is going to happen is that the last page of the passport will not be printed, on which information like father, mother, husband or wife's name, address is mentioned
 is nae badlaav kaa ye asar bhi hoga ki passport pate ke pruf ke taur par maanya dastavej nahin rahegaa
 When asked about the issue of the last page of the passport not being printed, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs was asked, he said, a three-member committee was set up to consider various issues related to the passport
 is cameti main videsh mantralay or mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay ke adhikari shaamil the
 This committee had to consider such cases where the mother / child demanded removal of the father's name
 saath hi aise bacchon ke passport se jude muddon par bhi cameti ko vichaar karnaa tha jo single parent santan hai yaa god liye hue hai
 The recommendations of the committee have been approved by the Ministry of External Affairs
 cameti ne sifarish kii thi ki videsh mantralay ko aisi sambhaavna par gaur karnaa chahie, jisase ki passport bocolate se pita / vaidhanik abhibhavak, maa, pati yaa patni ke naam or pate kii jaankaree ko hataaya ja sake jo ki abhi passport bocolate ke aakhri panne par hoti hai
 According to a foreign ministry spokesperson, the ministry held consultations with various stakeholders regarding the committee's recommendations

 passport bocolate ke aakhri panne par pita, mata, pati yaa patni ke naam, pataa, imigration check aavashyak (ECR), puraane passport kaa number, passport jari karne or jari karne kii jagah kaa ullekh hota he
 Now the last page of the passport will not be printed, so the applicant for whom an immigration check is required, the color of the upper jacket of the passport booklet will be orange
 vahiin jinhen imigration check kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi, unhen abhi kii tarah nile rang kii uprijacket valapassport jari kiya jaataa rahegaa
 Old passports will remain valid According to the spokesperson, the Indian Security Press (ISP), Nashik has been entrusted with the responsibility of designing new passport booklets
 jab tak aiespi nasik kii ore se nae passport bucolats ke dizin ko final kar taiyaar karne ke baad mantralay ko nahin saunpa jaataa tab tak passport or anya yatra dastavej aakhri panne ke saath print hote rahenge

 According to 'the Hindu' report, India is considering mentioning Imran Khan's remarks in its report ahead of the FATF meeting in October

 30,000-40,000 terrorists are active
in conversation with 'united States Institute of Peace', Imran said, the previous governments could not do any work on the 'national Action Plan', because if you talk about terrorist groups, then currently 30,000-40,000 people Who have weapons and are being trained
 yah pakistan kii taraf se pehla aisa spasht kaboolnamaa he ki unki jameen se hajaaron sakriy aatanki or prashikshan camp oparate kiye ja rahe hai
 In another event, Imran also said that after the 9 / 11 attack in 2001, about 40 terrorist organizations are active
 nai dilli main sarkari sutron ne kaha ki ve khush hai ki pakistani pradhanmantri ne apni jameen par aatanki sanghathanon ke sakriy hone kii baat sweekaar kii
 An official told The Hindu, however, that it is also necessary for the Pakistani leadership to take credible action in the area under its control and destroy the terrorist bases

 Imran also accused his predecessor governments of hiding the truth from the US
 FATF kar saktaa he blaclystasarkaari sutron ne bataaya ki imran khan ne aatankiyon kaa jo aankada diya he, vah pakistan ke FATF ke saamne dastavejon main bataai gai sankhya se bahut zyada he
 If Pakistan does not fulfill the conditions to end terrorism under its Action Plan on Terror, then FATF may be blacklisted in October

 The source said, Imran Khan's statement has raised the question that how effective is the FATF action plan that Pakistan is talking about vigorously? With this, India has got a chance to raise this issue in front of the institution
 yah pehali baar nahin he ki imran khan ne aatankwaad par khulaasa kar vivaad khadaa kar diya ho
 In April this year, he was heavily criticized in the parliament of Pakistan because he had said in a meeting with the Iranian president in Tehran that anti-iran terrorist organizations were active on Pakistan's land

 or ab yahi samvidhan bisisiai or cricket prashaskeey cameti (COA) ke liye sawaal khadaa kar rahaa he:kuch aise saurav ganguli ne kiya keel rahul or hardik pandya kaa bachaavvartmaan tasviir saaf taur par yahi kah rahi he ki COA ke sadasyon vinod raay or dyna adulji ke aapasi matbhed ke kaaran khud sioe or puraa maamla or uphaas or chintaa ke vishay main tabdeel ho gaya he
 The reason is that the 'drama' of this investigation has put the future of Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul at stake, who have already suffered more 'punishment'
 isamen koi bahes kii gunjaaish nahin ki agar donon khilaadiyon ko dandit karne ke liye niyamon main bhi badlaav karnaa pade, to vah hona chahie
 Hardik Pandya's words in Karan Johar's 'show' are not acceptable at all
 lekin kisi bhi aparaadh yaa galati ke liye khilaadiyon yaa sambhddha vyakti ko iskaa ahsaas karaane or unhen ‘tabah karne' ke bich bahut hi moti rekha he
 Not only the media, but also the general cricket fans are clearly seeing this thick line
 khulkar charchaa ho rahi he to sioe ko yah moti rekha kyon nahin dikh rahi? durbhagyavash, thik hardik pandya ke shabdon kii tarah bisisiai yaa sioe bhi yah rekha paar kar chuke hai
 Hardik Pandya's father said, My son is neither leaving the house nor is picking up anybody's phone, the reason is clear that according to the rules, the investigation has to start within 48 hours, while it is still decided that How will the investigation be done and who will do it
 or yah ho rahaa he sioe ke donon sadasyon ke aapasi matbhed ke chalate
 One member does not have confidence in CEO Johri only! In such a situation, what is the rationale of the CEO on the board? And what does the constitutional rule of inquiry mean? However, in this spectacle, very important time is being wasted in terms of planning and preparation of KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya and Team India World Cup
 ab jabaki jaanch kaa vishay bisisiai ke samvidhan ke daayre main hona tha to board ne is maamle main court main jaakar lokapal gathit karne kii maang karke ek or badi galati kar di
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court deferred hearing on the case for a week
 matlab yah sunwaayee kareeb 26 janvari tak sambhav hogi
 On this day, Team India will be playing their second ODI against New Zealand
 is din tak australia ke khilaaf teen vanade ko milakar keel rahul or hardik pandya paanch maichon se nilambit ho chuke honge
 
 
 And if the hearing was not done in a 'correct and smooth manner', both the players and many of the matches would have been out by the time the results of the investigation came out
 aakhir in donon ko kitni sajaa vahan kerani hogi? kya paanch maichon kaa nuksaan donon ko galati kaa ahsaas karaane yaa paryaapt sajaa ke liye kaaphi nahin he ? COA aakhir kya chaahati he? agar vartmaan sthiti jari rahati he, to kya donon khilaadi worldcup kii taiyaariyon ke lihaaj se acchhee manodasha or jaruri match abhyaas hasil kar paaenge? khaskar yah dekhte hue ki vishwa cap se pehle team india ke paas bamushkil hi 10-11 match bache hai
 Another big blow to Hardik Pandya, the big deal ended by the giant, 'big loss' coa's attitude is not only really harming KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya's careers, but they are also team planning and preparations for World Cup Is also affecting or na hijmaua apane ravaiye se koi acha udhaaharan hi pesh kar rahi he
 It should not be forgotten that both the players have already got severe punishment
 paanch match (koun jaanata he ki aage kitne or?), anubandh, chhavi, sammaan vagairah-vagairah
 And according to the rules of 'natural principles of justice' it has become more than necessary! The question is if the same incident happened around the World Cup
 or ye donon khilaadi asaadhaaran pradarshan kar rahe hote yaa team india kaa koi 'bade naam vaala' khilaadi is tarah kii ghatana main funs jaataa to kya tab bhi sioe aisa hi ravaiya dikhaati?vastav main, keel rahul or hardik pandya kii tarah hi sioe ko bhi apni ‘chaal-dhaal' durust karne kii jarurat he
 On this issue that has been 'excessively', the legends of Indian cricket need to come forward who used strong words for Hardik and KL Rahul
 in donon ko apane hisse kii acchhee khaasi sajaa mil chuki he
 At the moment, as the matter is being dealt with, he seems to be more 'destroying' the reforms
 team india ko donon hi khilaadiyon kii jarurat he or ye worldcup kii planning ke lihaaj se bahut hi ahm hai
 Sourav Ganguly rightly said that the player is not a machine that everything comes out right from him
 is baat se aage badhkar donon ko phir se manch pradaan karne kii jarurat he
 Does the coa's insistence on needlessly continue or will there be a 'proper route' in this regard? This is the big question now

 Both these parties are making new promises and alliances with regional parties to attract the general public towards themselves
 lekin in donon dolon ko apane puraane sahyogi dalon ke saath rishton main khatas bhi dekhi ja rahi he
 All is not well with Congress's Janata Dal (secular) in Karnataka and bjp's relationship with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 aagaamee aam chunaavon main modi sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye congress ne bihar main rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or purv kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party sahit anya kai dalon ke saath mahagabandhan banaaya
 The alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress in Maharashtra has almost been finalized
 bas aupchaarik taur par ghoshnaa honi baaki he
 But it is facing a tussle over its relationship with JDS in Karnataka
 somvaar ko to naubat yahaan tak aa gai ki karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami bol pade ki, 'vah pad chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai, congress ke vidhayak apni seemaa laangh rahe hai
 Congress leaders should control their mlas
 ' karnataka main puraa vivaad cabinet main or logon ko shaamil kiye jane ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa haiyanarazgi jo aa gai sataha parasal main, congress ke kuch vidhayakon ne kaha tha ki unke netaa kumaraswami nahin balki congress ke siddharmaiya hai
 Due to which HD Kumaraswamy was angry
 kumaraswami ne kaha ki congress ko in sabhi muddon ko dekhnaa chahie, agar wo ye sab jari rakhana chaahate hai to main pad chhodane ke liye taiyaar hum
 This is not the first time he has had to share his pain
 vah pehle bhi is tarah se bayaan de chuke hai
 It was said that the BJP tried to run Operation Lotus in Karnataka amid this tussle between JDS and Congress
 haalanki congress ke netaa shahanvaj alam jedies or congress main kisi khatas kii baat ko khaarij karte hai
 He says that BJP does not like democracy
 vah loktantr kii hatya karnaa chaahati he
 Therefore, in states where BJP is close to majority, it wants to destabilize Congress governments by manipulating it
 chaahe wo karnataka ho, madhya pradesh ho yaa phir goa
 Although the Congress is denying the fact that the old allies are upset, but there is a conflict between them
 kyonki mahagathbandhan formule se bani karnataka kii congress or jedies sarkaar ke bich aksar vivaad sataha par aa ja rahe hai
 While showing eye to BJP, the BJP is also facing resentment from its old allies
 maharashtra shivasena ho yaa uttar pradesh main suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh or yogi sarkaar main mantri om prakaash rajbhar hon yaa apana dal (es) kii adhyaksh anupriya patel, jab tab ye dal bijepi ko aankh dikhaate hi rahete hai
 Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), who was in the NDA and a minister in the Modi government, has already left the BJP
 ab bijepi ko bihar main nitish kumaar kii party jediu kaa hi saath bachaa he
 The tussle in Maharashtra has increased so much that just before the Lok Sabha elections, there has been a battle between BJP and Shiv Sena to prove themselves as big brothers
 somvaar ko shivasena kii baithak hui
 In this it is indicated that Shiv Sena is not going to back down from its point
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut kaa kahana he, 'maharashtra main shivasena hi bade bhai kaa role adaa karegi
 We do not accept bjp's 50-50 formula
 'isi baithak main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne apane saansadon ko naseehat di ki vah rafel vimaan saude kaa mudda jor-shor se uthaate rahen
 He continued to raise the demand of JPC in Parliament regarding the Rafale Deal
 shivasena ke isi ravaiye par maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki ham gathbandhan ke liye utaavle nahin hai
 Look in the mirror of both these statements, their relationship can be seen clearly
 asal main shivasena centre or maharashtra sarkaar main bijepi kii sahyogi he or vah chaahati he ki use zyada tarjeeh di jaae lekin devendra fadanvis kii baton se lagata he ki bijepi iske mood main nahin he
 Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP has come to power by becoming more powerful than before
 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla sansad satr somvaar yani 17 june se shuru ho gaya jo 26 july tak chalegaa
 In the 40-day Parliament session, the government will introduce a bill to rid Muslim women of triple talaq
 vahiin, loksabhaa main mili karaari haar ke baad congress teen talaak bill par dharm sankat main funs gai he
 If the Congress opposes triple talaq in the Parliament, the BJP will face accusations of Muslim appeasement and if it supports, there will be fear of displeasure of the Muslim vote bank
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki congress sansad main kya rukh apanaati he
 In the first meeting of the cabinet after the Modi government formed for the second time at the Center, the ordinance of triple talaq has been approved to get Muslim women out of triple talaq, which is now to be tabled in Parliament
 haalanki saal 2017 main sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar se jude is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit kara liya tha lekin rajyasabha se paas nahin ho sakaa tha or yah bill ucch sadan ne waapas bhej diya tha
 It was naturally repealed after the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki teen talaak se jude ordinance ko piem narendra modi kii adhyakshata main pichley dinon hui cabinet kii baithak main manjuuri de di gai
 It also includes some of the opposition's demands
 iske baad ab teen talaak se judaa bill is prakaar he
 1- In this case the FIR will be accepted only when the wife or her close blood relatives is lodged
 vipaksh or kai sanghathanon kii chintaa thi ki is maamle main exiaar kaa koi durupyog kar saktaa he
 2- If there is an initiative of later agreement between the wife and husband, then the magistrate can get the agreement
 jabaki isse pehle ke bill main iske liye praavdhaan nahin the
 The opposition argued that it should be arranged
 3- tatkaal teen talaak abhi gairajamaanti aparaadh bana rahegaa, lekin ab isamen aisi vyavastha kar di gai he ki magistrate isamen jamaanat de saktaa he
 However, before this, the magistrate will have to hear the wife
 isse pehle bill main teen saal kii sajaa ke praavdhaan ke baad jamaanat kii gunjaaish nahin di gai thi
 In fact, in the last session when the government introduced this bill in the Rajya Sabha on the last day, the opposition did not allow the bill to pass, saying that the government has hurriedly introduced this bill without everyone's consent
 ab sarkaar ne teen talaak bill main sansodhan kar nae adhyadesh ko manjuuri di he, jise sansad ke isi bajet satr main modi sarkaar pesh karegi
 Congress Rajya Sabha member and spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said while speaking to journalists recently, 'we have raised some basic issues on triple talaq
 sarkaar kai binduon par sahamat hui he
 However Singhvi said that there are still one or two points left and those points need to be discussed
 aise main ham vidheyak kaa virodh karenge
 Not only Congress, but bjp's main ally JDU is also firm on the fact that the punishment of three divorce convicts in criminal category cannot be a practical step in any case
 jediu teen talaak ke mudde par rajyasabha main bijepi kaa is bill par samarthan nahin karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The JDU states that triple talaq is a social issue and should be resolved through society at the social level
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko jis tarah se haar mili he, iske baad ab teen talaak bill par pehle jaise hi tevar akhriyaar karnaa uske liye aasaan nahin hoga
 This is the reason why Congress leaders are telling Dabi Juban that the party will not oppose the bill as before
 darasal congress virodh karti he to use bijepi ke muslim tushtikaran kaa aarope kaa bhi saamana karnaa hoga
 BJP leaders have said many times that the Congress has been opposing the bill due to the Muslim vote bank
 haalanki supreme court dwaara teen talaak ko avaidh qaraar dene ke kadam kaa congress samet lagbhag kai dalon ne swaagat kiya tha
 His opposition to the bill brought through the ordinance is to adopt a pragmatic approach to the stringent provision of a three-year prison sentence for Muslim men convicted of three divorces, which is still kept by the government
 bijepi ke varisht netaa yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ko narendra modi ko 'sampradayik' nahin kahana chahie
 He also said, 'nitish Kumar should not even oppose Modi
 agar vah endie chhod kar janaa chaahate hai to party unhen jane degi
 'india Today Survey: Narendra Modi at the forefront for the post of PM Sinha, who was the finance minister in the NDA government, said that if JDU separates itself from NDA, then after that BJP will decide its way
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko piem ummidavaar banane kii vakaalat karte hue yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Modi is a charismatic leader
 narendra modi: 'shunya' se 'shikhar' tak kaa safar
 
 
 At the same time, Yashwant Sinha did not miss out on the former BJP president Nitin Gadkari
 unhone kaha ki agar gadakari pehle hi adhyaksh pad chhod dete to party ko itnaa nuksaan nahin hota, jo abhi hua he
 According to Yashwant Sinha, due to Gadkari, the party had to go on the backfoot in the case of corruption
 yashavanth sinha ke is bayaan par bijepi pravaktaa nirmaala sitaraman ne zyada kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya
 He said that Yashwant Sinha is a senior leader of our party
 unhen apane vichaar vyakt karne kii aazaadee he
 i do not think anything more needs to be added to this statement

 The BJP is once again removing the formula for the last Lok Sabha election, like 2014
 bijepi ek baar phir chaay kii dukaanon par pahunch rahi he
 This time the BJP is not making tea, but the BJP is trying to take tea from the cup of Namo again 2019, whoever comes to the tea shops

 haalanki ye muft main nahin hai, ek cap pachaas paise kaa he
 BJP says this money will be invested in the Namami Gange scheme
 iske baad bijepi netaa isi cap se logon ko chaay pilaate hue bhi najar aae
 The Chowkidar and the chaiwalabjp Although this time the issue of the watchman seems to be creating an atmosphere among the public, but the BJP does not want to let the taste of tea be forgotten by the people, who had tasted the BJP victory in 2014
 ye chaay bijepi ke liye tonic kaa kaam kar sakati he
 As soon as people at the tea shop sipped tea from this cup
 logon main raajnneeti kaa paara chadhta hua najar aayaa
 a person who came to drink tea offered Rahul Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to drink tea from this cup
 dilli bijepi ke pradesh upaadhyaksh jai prakaash kaa kahana he ki dilli main jagah jagah in cap ko chaay dukaanon tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he, haalanki kitni sankhya main ye cap pahunchaae jaaenge, is bare main saaf saaf nahin bataaya gaya he
 But according to the source, Delhi BJP is trying to get several thousand cups in every assembly
 darasal bijepi chaahati he ki chunaav ke vakt dilli main jo bhi chaay kii chuskee le isi cap se le or shaayad phir vot bhi bijepi ke khate main jaae
 However, people have to see how much tea people like in the hot summer

 Claiming that Congress candidate was in a better position in Maharajganj by-election, Raj Babbar said that if a regional party candidate wins in this by-election, then there will be an increase in the number of mps in their account, but if the Congress candidate wins, the central government's share Can be made, which will prove to be helpful in the development here

 Rahul also said that pointing to Harsimrat Kaur Badal, MP from the Akali Dal and Minister of the Modi government, said that the leader of the Akali Dal was smiling upon seeing him
 rahul ne aage kaha ki aaj yah bhaavana puure desh main he
 Their job is to add to this feeling
 iske baad rahul ne kaha ki puraa kaa puraa vipaksh or aapke (bijepi) ke bahut saare log milakar piem modi ko chunaav main haraane ja rahe hai
 One way can be deduced from this part of Rahul's speech that the Congress strategy is actually to mobilize the BJP leaders against Prime Minister Modi against the Modi government, who are angry with the PM in their tongue
 lekin dar kii vajah se mukhar nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Recently, BJP MP from bhandara-gondia in Maharashtra, Nana Patole joined the Congress by resigning from the party and Parliament
 vahiin bihar se bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha or kirti aaazaad bhi party main rahakar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khole hue hai
 Shatrughan Sinha has been openly expressing his closeness with RJD
 vahiin kirti aaazaad kii patni or dilli se purv vidhayak punam aaazaad congress main shaamil ho chuki hai
 BJP MP from Bahraich, Savitri Bai Phule has openly opened a front against Modi and the Yogi government of UP
 vahiin kuch aise saansad bhi hai jinka tikat katnaa tay he lekin ve sarkaar ke khilaaf abhi khulkar saamne nahin aa rahe he
 Before the 2014 elections, a large number of Congress mps and leaders joined the BJP
 jinamein lagbhag 90 fisadi congress netaa bijepi se saansad bhi bane
 Gurugram MP and Union Minister Rao Inderjit Singh, Congress leader from Haryana, Chaudhary Virendra Singh, Congress leader from UP Gonda Jagdambika Pal were such big leaders who had suppressed the BJP in view of the possible defeat of the Congress
 ab aisa maaloom pad rahaa he ki congress bijepi kii ranneeti usee par doharaana chaah rahi he or uske asantusht saansad or ghatak dalon ko vipakshi kheme main laana chaahati he

 Let me tell you that this man named Girish Maheshwari was arrested on Thursday
 jab maheshwari ke soshal media handles ko khangala gaya to paaya ki usne fasebuk or twitor acounts par profile pikchar ke taur par bhagwaan hanuman kii tasviir laga rakhi he
 On his Twitter handle (@ girishk1605) Maheshwari has claimed that 'more dangerous than Hitler'
 ab ye acount delit kar diya gaya haimaheshwari ne apane fasebuk pej par hanuman kii tarah majbootee or bhavyata se khadey rahane kii ichha jataa rakhi he
 On social media, a large number of fierce reactions came to light about the threat of Maheshwari
 grih mantri rajnath singh ke maamle main dakhal dene ke baad maharashtra police teji se harakat main ai
 Maheshwari was arrested from the outskirts of Ahmedabad
 darasal maheshwari ke bijepi se jude hone ke aaropon ko aadhaar uske fasebuk profile ne hi diya
 In this profile, Maheshwari has described herself as an 'accounting associate' of the BJP
 saath hi usne khud ko swaniyojit ( self-employed) bhi bataa rakhaa he
 Viral test team investigation revealed that 36-year-old Maheshwari is originally from Ajmer district of Rajasthan
 apane teen bhaaiyon ke saath wo pichley 6 saal se gujarat main rah rahaa tha
 Maheshwari's brother Nandu and family run a grocery shop outside the Swaminarayan temple
 ahmedabad rural ke espi aar ve asari ke mutabik maheshwari ahmedabad ke satellite toun bawalaa main rah rahaa tha
 Maheshwari is an accountant but till now he was working as a sales officer in a company that deals in agricultural products
 espi ne bataaya ki police ne uske becoground kii jaanch kii to use kisi bhiraajnneetik dal sejuda nahin paaya
 Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya has also called Maheshwari's reports about working for BJP unfounded
 pandya ne kaha, ‘gujarat bijepi main acounting associat jaisaa koi pad nahin he
 In such a situation, there is no question of Maheshwari working for us
 wo hamaari party kaa praathmik sadsy bhi nahin he
 The viral test team also spoke to Maheshwari's brother Nandu
 nandu is vakt maheshwari kii jamaanat yachika kaa itanjam karne ke liye mumbai main he
 Nandu also said that Maheshwari or her family has nothing to do with the BJP
 jab gujarat or rajasthan bijepi kii websitis par girish maheshawari kaa naam talashne kii koshish kii gai to uske naam kii koi entry nahin mili
 However, looking at the social media posts of Girish Maheshwari, it shows that he is a BJP supporter and a fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 fasebuk par or ab delit kar die gaye twitor handle kii padtaal se pataa chalata he ki wo adhiktar ritvit or dusron kii post ko hi share karata tha
 But sometimes he used to write himself, it was very humiliating
 jaise ki usne ek baar likhaa ki hindu bhaaiyon or bahanon ko paisa ikattha karke dena chahie jisase ki wo sonia gandhi ke dance kaintjaam kar sake
 However, nothing was found on Maheshwari's timeline that would prove to be any BJP official

 iske baad donon ek duusare par koi daawa nahin karenge
 The comments gauratlab he ki pichhali sunwaayee main patna uniwarsity ke professor matukanath kii patni ko supreme court ne salaah dete hue kaha tha ki aise vyakti ke saath sambandh na rakhe, jo aapaki parvaah nahi karata
 The Supreme Court had told Matuknath's wife that we will protect your interests, people like you can become leaders of society
 aap jaise logo ko pratadit nahi hona chahie, balki majbootee se ladanaa chahie
 Matuknath is a professor of Hindi at Patna University who lived in a live-in with a student 30 years younger than his age and left his wife in 2004
 unki patni abha pichley 10 saalon se apane haq ke liye lard rahi he, taaki unako guzarabhatta mil sake

 sibiai ne tab elaan kiya tha
 Things happened
 chitthee bhi likhi gai or to or ganga kii dhar rokane ke liye bhi saare jatan kiye
 But did not do what was needed most
 yani jarurat kabr khod kar laashen nikaalane kii
 Then thought came, but by then it was too late
 laashon ke saath-saath puri jaanch hi pani main ja chuki thi
 Yes, we are talking about that Badaun case in which two sisters were killed and hung on a tree
 kahaan to tay tha ki gangrape kaa shikaar hui donon bahanon kii laashen nikaal kar sibiai unka dobaaraa postmortem karavaaegi or kahaan in laashon ko nikaalnaa to dur, laashon tak pahunchnaa bhi sibiai ke liye muhaal hua ja rahaa he
 It was thundered that after the fast Ganga has taken these graves in its wake, after this, has the CBI, the flood management department of the state or even the flood section department, raised its hands in the matter of getting access to the graves
 ab haalat ye hai ki aane vaale chand dinon main to kya agle do-teen maheene tak donon bahanon kii laashon ko khod kar dobaaraa baahar nikalvaanaa takreeban naammumkin he
 In fact, with the investigation of this famous gang rape case of Badaun handed over to the CBI, the premier investigating agency of the country had announced to get the dead bodies removed from the tomb again for post-mortem
 yah baat 9 july kii he or tab se ab tak sibiai kahati or sirf kahati hi rah gai
 After a full ten days, that is, on July 19, when the CBI arrived for the excavation of these tombs built on the banks of the Ganges river, everything had changed
 kabr ganga kii laharon main saat-aath feet neeche gahare pani main samaa chuke the or sibiai jaise-jaise in laashon kii khudaai ke liye yahaan se pani nikaalane kaa intjaam karti, vaise-vaise or zyada pani in kabron ke aas-paas bhar jaataa
 What CBI has been doing for ten days? Tell you the whole Ram story of the CBI exercise ahead of it, before that you know what the country's largest investigative agency would have done for the entire ten days from July 9 to July 19
 doing? How the investigation of an important case was delayed
 kabr se laash baahar nikaalane kii jarurat isliye aa padi kyonki is baat ko lekar sawaal khadey ho gaye the ki donon bahanon ke saath rape hua bhi he yaa nahin
 But for the post-mortem, eight days were spent in setting up the medical board, and by the time the medical board was ready on July 17, nature had done its work
 rahasy kii chadar main lipte badaayun gangrape maamle kii jaanch jab sibiai se karaae jane kaa elaan hua tha, to laga tha ki ab gunahagaaron ke chehre se pardaa hat jayega
 But now it is also difficult to reach out to the dead bodies
 aise main bagaiyr pukhta forensik subut ke sibiai gunahagaaron ko sajaa kaise dilaaegi, yahi sabase bada sawaal he
 CBI was aware of everything, CBI was fully aware of the reality of the ground level
 yahi nahin, use ye bhi acchhee tarah pataa tha ki donon bahanon kii laashen ganga nadi ke kinare ek aisi jagah par dafn he, jo nadi ke cachament aria main aata he or har saal barsaat ke dinon main ye ilaake puri tarah dub jaataa he
 But instead of quickly digging the graves and extracting the corpses, the CBI thought it better to play a game of accounts with other government departments
 pehle dm ko chitthee likh kar khudaai ke liye suraksha intjaam karne kii baat kahi or tab narora dam prabandhan se bhi rabta kaayam kiya taaki ganga kaa pani chhodane se roka ja sake
 But despite this, she could not bother to reach the spot
 udhar, dm ne jahaan jaldi se khudaai nahin hone par kabron ke dub jane kii baat kahi, vahiin narora dam ne bhi sibiai ko 24 ghante kaa vakt dete hue ye saaf kar diya agar usne itane vakt main laashen nahin nikalwai to dam prabandhan ke liye pani rokna mushkil ho jayega
 See cbi's amazing Kahili that he did not think of getting the corpses on the spot
 wo aaraam-aaraam se badaayun pahunchane kaa plan banaati rahi
 The time had changed by the time the CBI team arrived here on July 19 with full fervor
 sukhi jameen par pani bhar chukaa tha
 The graves were buried 9 feet under water
 pani main bahaai mehnatajab sab khatm ho gaya to sibiai ne baadh khand vibhaag ke saath ganga kii dhar main saikadon ret kii boriyaan daalkar pani kii dhar ko rokane kii koshish kii
 Two or two tubewells were used to drain water
 lekin hua vahi jo hona tha
 Here, water came out from one side, double water from the other side filled the tombs
 nateeja, ye hua ki pehla din bilkul bekaar chalaa gaya
 Officers went back to their hotels and government guest houses
 duusare din jab dobaaraa maukey par pahunche to ret kii boriyaan bhi pani main dub chuki thi
 It was a matter of honor that the CBI had buried a flag as a mark of the graves, so the graves could be identified
 ab sibiai ne jhenp mitaane ke liye ek taraf jahaan us ped kii daal par naap-jokh karnaa shuru kar diya he jis daal par laashen tangi thi, vahiin duusari taraf gharavaalon se ghanton lambii poochtacha kii gai

 kendriya khel mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod ne 'panchayat ajtak' ke manch se desh ke bacchon ke sunahare bhavishya ke liye bada elaan kiya he
 He said that the government will select one crore children every year through the application and 20 thousand of them will be sorted and their DNA test will be done and they will also be given an amount of Rs 5 lakh annually to move forward in future
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar kii ek khaasiyat he ki koi bhi mantralay ho, usamen jo khaas policy banati he, uske upar exparts to hote hi hai, duusare mantralay ke mantriyon se bhi salaah lee jaati he
 The target Olympic podium started in 2014 was of our government, whatever the minister, it was the decision of the government
 rathod ne bataaya ki pichley chaar saal ke andar target olympic podium ek aise mukaam par pahunch gaya he ki jo elite athleates hai unhen hamane sabase pehle alag kiya
 Also, he separated those who are good players
 elite athleates ko 2014 se alag se funding milani shuru hui
 There is no shortage of money on the coach of the world, where the finger is placed on the country
 ye parampara chal padi he
 At the Target Olympic Podium, we went ahead and started funding up to 50 thousand rupees so that the players do not have to take their parents
 ye kahkar ki ye aapkaa pocket alouns he jo ki training or baaki chizon se alag he
 Selection of 20 thousand children will be done every year
 He said that players of 16-17 years came to Khelo India
 ab is saal se deshbhar ke 8-10 saal ke bacchon kaa test lenaa shuru karenge
 Through an application, through schools and through parents, we will start doing those basic tests
 iske tahat ham har saal ek karod bacchon kaa test karenge
 Out of that, we will sort 20 thousand children, get their DNA tested, get IQ test done
 taaki hamen bhi pataa chale ki wo 8 saal kaa baccha kitna lanbaa ho jayega
 How much power is there in his feet wo wollyboul khilaadi ban saktaa he, tennis khel saktaa he yaa phir koi or khel, iskaa aankalan kar sakenge
 Under this, at the age of 8 years, we will start giving 5 lakhs per year to a child for 8 years
 aise main jab wo baccha 16 saal kii umr tak pahonchega, us samay jab use koi sponcership nahin milegi to bharat sarkaar use sponcer karegi
 'not only the head coach, the primary coach will also get money' Rajyavardhan further said that the role of a guru is very important in life and there are coaches within the sports
 abhi tak sirf unheen kochon ko incentive diya jaataa tha jo sabase upar ke level par rahete the, jinhone olympic medal jitwa diya, jinhone asian games jitwa diya
 But no one asked them who first discovered the medal winning athlete
 rajyavardhan ne kaha hamane policy badali or ab use bhi 20 fisadi paisa jayega
 This means that now the Apex coach of the player who won the medal will get 50% fund and the coach searching for that player in the primary will be given 20% money
 iske alaava 30 fisadi paisa us coach ko milegaa jisane primary se middle skool tak un bacchon ko taraasha hoga
 Every coach has an important role at every level

 mistre ne ratan tatake 75 varsh kii aayu puri karne par unki sevanivrutt ke baad 29 disambar 2012 ko chairman kaa pad bhaar sambhala tha
 Mistry has been on the board of directors of the company since 2006
 company ke sabase bade hissedaar shapurji palonji ne company ke chairman pad ke liye unke naam kii sifarish kii thi
 Mistry was the sixth chairman of the Tata group and the second chairman after Noroji Saklatwala who did not have a Tata name
 arthshaastriyon ne ek samay main unhen bharat tathaa britain kaa sabase mahatvapurn udyogpati qaraar diya tha
 Mistry took over as chairman from Ratan Tata at a time when many Tata group companies were in bad shape and their biggest challenge was to scuttle the international steel business and keep other businesses united

 Earlier, Sehwag won the toss for the fourth consecutive time in the series and decided to bat first
 unhone gambhir ke saath milakar bharat ko tufaani shuruyaat dilaai
 Gambhir, however, was lucky on a personal score of 20 when Andre Russell dripped his catch off his own ball in his first over
 donon salaami ballebaajon ne 10 over main team kaa score 63 ran tak pahunchaaya
 West Indies captain Darren Sammy handed the ball in the 11th over to spinner Naren, whose first ball was sent by Sehwag for six runs over long on

 bharat ne 36wein over main ballebaaji powerple liya or paanch over main 48 ran jode
 Sehwag, meanwhile, was lucky when Rampal's ball was hoisted in the air in an attempt to pick up a personal score of 170 runs, but Sammy ran an extremely easy catch while running from extra cover
 team ne is bich 40wein over main 300 ran bhi puure kiye

 We choose a career in college life and choose a career and become part of a professional life
 lekin saalon profeshnal hote hue bhi ham kai baar aisi galtiyaan kar jate hai, jo dikhaai to choti detii he, lekin uske nuksaan bahut bade hote hai
 At the same time, mistakes are most common in professional life
 lekin in galatiyon ko samay par sudhaar kar bachaa ja saktaa hai
 So that you do not have to face any kind of trouble in future

 Before changing jobs, keep these things in mind: Take three things that will make your professional life perfect
 
 
 1
 If you really want to learn from your mistakes, then first of all, learn to accept mistakes
 aisa karnaa seekhney kii ore pehla kadam hoga
 There should be so much courage in us that we can accept our mistakes in front of others
 galatiyon se bachane ke liye bahaane or apana bachaav karne kii koshish bilkul naa karen
 Doing so may harm you in the future
 JOB TIPS: sardiyon main lag gai he morning shift, jaldi uthne ke liye apanaaen ye tareeke2
 Improve your work If your mistakes are constantly coming, then obviously you need to improve
 sabase pehle ye samajhane kii koshish karen ki aapse galati kahaan hui he or phir hal nikaalane kii koshish karen
 Not trying to correct a mistake after making a mistake is equivalent to making a mistake again
 3
 Seek help from others, do not feel ashamed while seeking the help of others to rectify your mistake
 saamne vaala aapke bare main kya sochega ye naa sochen
 We all need a mentor or experienced person for guidance
 ham unke anubhavon se sikh le sakate hai
 Remember mistakes are the ladder to success, just need to learn from them

 aaj relies hone vaali film he 'commando 2' relies hui he
 The film is directed by Deven Bhojani and one of its producers is Vipul Shah
 film main mukhya bhoomika main vidyut jamwaal, adaa sharma, fredy daruvala, isha gupta, thakur anup singh, satish kowshik or adil hossain najar aaenge
 The story of the film 'commando 2' is based on bringing back India's black money from foreign soil
 is mishan ke liye chaar logon kii ek team banati hai to malaysia us shaks ko laane jaati he, jo mani londering kaa sabase bada mafia he
 With the help of this person, many corrupt people of the country have deposited black money in Malaysia
 tark he kii use pakadaney se sab waapas mil jayega
 The essence of the story is that to see the action of the rest of the electricity Jamwal, you have to go to theaters
 ab is film kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon kii baat karte hai, jisase aapke liye yah faisla karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jayega ki aapako yah film dekhni chahie yaa nahin
 Talking about the flaws, the biggest flaw of this film is its script because the story is short which the team has failed to spread in a 2-hour film
 chand seens yaa dialog dekhen to film zaraa puraane dharre par chalati he
 At the same time the action scenes of the film are good but are so long that you will wait for it to end
 alag-alag kirdaaron kii kahaniyaan bhi aapako ubaau lag sakati hai
 The background music of the film makes a noise
 vahiin film kii khoobiyon main sabase badi khubi hai film ke hero vidyut jamwaal, jo 3 saal se marshall arts kii training le rahe hai or parde par unka ye ection ubhar kar najar aata he
 Vidyut designs his own action and his designed scenes are also effective in the film
 film main kai jagah unki dialog delivery bhi aapako acchhee lagegi
 At the same time, Freddy Daruwala and Isha Gupta's performance in the film is effective
 mujhe film kaa clymex bhi acha laga
 The Prime Minister of India promised the public to bring back the black money hidden abroad and deposit it in the bank account of the poor
 'commando-2' aapako isse jodygi or ho saktaa he kuch logon ko ye film prabhaavshaalee lage
 Film 2 from me 5 stars milte hai
 Now let's talk about the merits and demerits of this film, which will make it even easier for you to decide whether you should watch this film or not
 khaamiyon kii baat karen to is film kii sabase badi khami he isaki script kyonki kahani choti he jise 2 ghante kii film main failaane main team naakaam rahi he
 If you look at a few scenes or dialogues, the film runs on the old pattern
 vahiin film ke ection seens achche to hai lekin itane lambey hai ki iske khatm hone kaa aap intjaar karenge
 Stories of different characters may also make you feel boring
 film kaa becoground music shor machaata he
 At the same time, the biggest feature of the film's merits is the film's hero Vidyut Jamwal, who has been taking martial arts training for 3 years and his action appears on the screen
 vidyut apana ection khud dizin karte hai or film main unke digind seens bhi asardaar hai
 You will also like his dialogue delivery in many places in the film
 vahiin film main fredy daruvala, isha gupta kaa abhinay asardaar he
 i also liked the climax of the film
 bharat ke pradhanmantri ne janata se vaada kiya tha ki videsh main chupe kaale dhan ko waapas laaenge or garibon ke bank acount main jamaa karaayenge
 'commando-2' will connect you to this and maybe some people will find this film impressive

 ) The Constitution of India was finalized by our Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949
 isliye ham yah din samvidhan diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Since then, this constitution has been an incredible criterion for weighing the politics of our country
 70 saalon baad bhi yah samvidhan praasangik rahegaa, 1949 main isaki kalpana koi ati-ashaavadi hi shaayad kar paaya hoga
 After all, American professors Ginsburg, Elkins, and Melton found in a survey of worldwide constitutions that the average lifespan of a constitution is only 19 years
 unki research ne yah bhi paaya kii umrdaar samvidhan sanvaidhanik mulyon (jaise ki loktantr or moulikadhikaar) kii suraksha nae samvidhanon ke mukaable behatar karte hai
 Experts in constitutions also believe that constitutional stability is directly related to social stability - constitutional revolutions often encourage political turmoil and widespread social violence
 is sandarbh main bhartiya samvidhan kaa buzurgapan ek apwaad he
 a constitution is just a collection of a few words written on paper pages
 inako likhane vaale bhi kab ke guzar chuke
 Then why do strong politicians, military men with guns and tanks, wealthy industrialists, advance social classes, etc
, despite being powerful, kneel down in front of a book (even if their reverence is showy)? How afraid of a book? Even then gita-quran-bible can claim divine validity, a constitution is a completely human work
 phir kyon bharat main samvidhanwaad panpa? kuch logon, khaskar daliton, kii sanvaidhanik aasthaa kaa taalluk baba sahib ambedkar kii bhoomika se ho saktaa he
 His practical foresight is certainly reflected in our constitution
 par jin logon main yah vyaktigat aasthaa nahin, ve kyon is samvidhan ko maane? is baat ko samajhane ke liye hamen samvidhanwaad ke myne samajhane honge
 In a diverse society, when different types of people live together, social differences will definitely emerge
 jab mat bhinn hon, to saamaajik faisle kaise liye jaaen? multah aise samaaj ke saamne keval do vikalp hai- hinsa yaa raajnneeti
 Either we fight each other to see who wins and obey the same, or we try to understand each other's opinion through political debate and wish for a compromise
 samjhauton kii yah visheshta he ki unase har koi naakhush hota he- kisi ko bhi sab kuch khud ke man-mutabik nahin miltaa, par koi khaali haath bhi nahin jaataa
 The fundamental principle of constitutionalism is the priority of politics over violence
 ek safal samvidhan kii koshish yahi hoti he ki vah har varg ko yah tasalli de ki uske panpane kii sambhaavna hinsak raaston ke mukaable sanvaidhanik raajnneeti main zyada he
 Ravish Kumar's blog: Modi made 95,000 crores accused Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister Social groups can get this satisfaction only if the constitutional criteria are based on mutual agreements
 bhartiya samvidhan kii safalataa kaa mul kaaran he ki hamaari samvidhansabha main bhartiya samaaj ke har chote-bade virgon ko pratinidhitiv dene kii koshish kii gayi thi
 The scope of the constitution was decided through almost three years of long debate and hundreds of small and big agreements, not according to the choice of an autocratic leader or class-specific
 congress party ke paas bahumat tha, phir bhi usne kai vipakshi netaaon ko samvidhansabha main aamantrit kiya
 Baba Ambedkar himself was a political opponent of Pandit Nehru for decades, yet he was appointed the chairman of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly
 desh bantwaare ke baad hui hinsa kaa parinaam dekh chukaa tha
 That generation had understood that in a diverse country like India, the only alternative to violence could be by compromised democratic politics
 sab kii baat suni gayi
 No one got everything desired - many of Prime Minister Nehru's own opinions were not reflected in the Constitution
 doctor ambedkar ko bhi apni kai maangon par samjhauta karnaa padaa
 But the Constituent Assembly did not send anyone empty handed
 har kisi ko ek tasalli di gayi- aaj nahin to kal, yahaan nahin to vahaan, is vyavastha main aap bhi sattarudh ho sakate ho
 Today's loser can also win tomorrow
 hameshaa ke liye satta na to inaki hogi na aapaki
 At any given time, all the power of power was not divided into one human or institution, but into many different central and state-level institutions, so that no one could dominate anyone else
 kuch kamazor yaa alpsankhyak varg- jaise dalit, janajatiyaan, kashmiri, purvottar rajya aadi- jinako aanevaali bahumat vaali raajnneeti se kuch vaazib bechaini ho rahi thi- unako samvidhan ke antargat laane ke liye kuch khaas vaayade die gaye
 Autonomous Constitutional institutions (eg Supreme Court, Auditor General, Election Commission etc
) were set up so that they could guard constitutionalism
 antat itani vividh samvidhansabha main bhi bharat ke sanvaidhanik dastauez par sirf ek sadsy ne hastakshar karne se inkaar kiya
 All the other members - whether they were liberals or Gandhians, right-wingers or socialists, Hindus or Muslims, men as well as women - all signed this constitution and resolved to create a new country on its basis

 a video is becoming increasingly viral on social media, in which some policemen are seen raining sticks on the crowd
 video ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki police ne madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ke ghar ke baahar dharna de rahe berozegaar yuvakon kii dandon se pitayee kii
 It can be seen in the video that the police are driving away youths by lathi-charging them in a campus
 post ke capshan main likhaa he - "bhopal mukhyamantri camel nath nivas ke baahar dharna de rahe berozegaar yuvakon ko mili saugat !!!aaj subah sabhi berozegaar yuvakon ko naukari kaa jwine letters police dwaara haathon haath diya gaya
 "india Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being made with the video is misleading
 yah video ek saal purana he or uttar pradesh ke aligarh kaa he
 The video is being shared extensively on Facebook with false claims
 viral video ke saath kiye ja rahe daawey kii jaanch karne ke liye hamane is ghatana ke bare main internet par khojna shuru kiya
 We found that the incident took place outside the office of Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in June last year
 video main dikh rahe log hindu jaagran manch ke kaaryakarta the jo ek aaropee kii giraftaar kii maang ko lekar SSP offis ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe the
 According to reports, the protesters were shouting slogans closing the maingate of the office, causing problems in the government functioning
 jab police ke samajhane par kaaryakarta nahin maane to police ne un par lathicharge kar diya
 This case was also covered prominently in Media
 # WATCH: Police baton charge on members of Hindu Jagran Manch who were protesting outside the office of Aligarh Senior Superintent of Police (SSP), demanding the arrest of accused who had attacked one of their members

 com / vjkqowxukt — ANI UP (@aninewsup) June 12, 2018 It is not that this video went viral for the first time with a false claim
 pichley saal bhi is video ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke nivas kaa bataakar share kiya gaya tha
 At that time, Alt News dismissed this misleading post
 bollywood ke shandaar actor manoj bajpeyi ne buudhvaar ko ek twit karte hue filmphere aword list par naaraazgi jaahir kii
 Manoj said in a tweet, "my films are appreciated nationally and internationally
 lekin menstream aword kii nomination list main jagah nahin milti he
 "manoj also shared the poster of his 2018 film" Gully Gulian "
 manoj bajpeyi kaa ye twit 64th filmphere aword nomination list jari hone ke thik baad aayaa he
 It is believed that he has tweeted this in displeasure at the Filmfare Awards
 haalanki manoj bajpeyi ne apane twit main film fere kaa naam nahin liya he
 Let us tell that this time in the Best Film category for the Filmfare Award, Andhadhun, Badhaai Ho, Padmavat, Raji, Stree and Sanju have been placed
 best film actor ke liye akshay kumaar (padman), ayushmaan khurana (andhadhun), rajkumaar raav (stree), ranbir kapur (sanju), ranvir singh (padmaavat), shahrukh khan (zero) ko jagah mila he
 So used to the fact that all the films of mine which are highly acclaimed nationally and internationally don't even get a place in the nominations list of so called big mainstream awards here forget about winning
 creative pursuit and exploitation continue
