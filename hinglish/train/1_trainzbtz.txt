 divilliars ne kaha ki yadi mejabaan team apane majboot paksh ke anuroop pich main badlaav karti he to usamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Our defeat was exaggerated
 Like Indian Test captain Virat Kohli, de Villiers also said that there was nothing wrong in Mohali's pitch
 unhone kaha, ‘bilkul (pehle test match main haar) iske bare main bahut kuch kaha gaya he
 It was offered exaggeratedly
 yadi aap donon tiimon ke scorcard dekho to kisi ne bhi shatak nahin banaaya
 Both teams have struggled on that pitch
 donon tiimon ko spinneron ke saamne jujhna padaa or kuch avasaron par unhone galat shot khele
 We lost because we were unable to perform to the best of our ability in two seasons and we would have to bear the brunt of it

 i think we have the power to face this challenge
 hamane pehle test match main iske sanket die lekin lambey samay tak aisa nahin kar paae
 Hopefully in this match, we will get the rhythm
 ’ unhone aage kaha, ‘main bengalooru main kisi bhi tarah kii wicket par khilne ke liye taiyaar hum
 We know that there will be a turn on this
 yah wanderrs jaisaa wicket nahin hoga
 The South African team is known for making a comeback and battling it out
 mujhe vishwaas he ki khilaadi duusare test match ko lekar utsaah se labarej honge
 'I want to be a threat to the opposing team
 Regarding his own batting, de Villiers said that he wants to be a threat to any team
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe krij par urjavan bane rahanaa pasand he
 i want to remain a threat to the opposing team
 main chahta hum ki unke dimag main yah baat rahe ki yadi maine itani der tak ballebaaji kar lee to main unase match chin saktaa hum
 That's why i play this game
 main match jeetne main apana prabhaav chhodana chahta hum’ gauratlab he ki siries kaa doosraa test match divilliars kaa 100waan match hoga or is star ballebaaj ne kaha ki vah kisi tarah ke dabaav main nahin hai
 He said, 'this is my 100th Test match, because of this i am not under any kind of pressure
 main jab bhi krij par jaataa hum to kisi tarah ke dabaav main nahin rahata
 Our team is lagging behind in the series and that is why i feel pressure and i want my team to come back in the series
 ’sauvaan test khilne kii he khushiunhone kaha ki vah apana 100waan test match duniya ke kisi bhi sthaan par khilne ko lekar khush hai
 De Villiers said, 'I don't think about these kinds of things
 mere liye yah myne nahin rakhata ki main apana 100waan test match kahaan khel rahaa hum
 If it were also Bangladesh, i would have liked it
 mere liye yah bhi myne nahin rakhata tha ki maine apana 50waan test kahaan khelaa tha
 It is a great honor for me to represent the country but at the same time i would like to add that Bengaluru is really special for me

 hardik pandya ne australia ke khilaaf vanade siries main apni jabardast chhap chodi he
 Pandya was the Player of the Series against the Kangaroos due to his all-round performance
 ballebaaji karte hue unhone jahaan 222 ran batore, vahiin 6 wicket bhi chatkaaye
 Pandya, who is going to be 24 years old, is being compared to former Indian veteran all-rounder Kapil Dev these days
 pichley dinon kapil ne bhi pandya ko khud se behatar cricketer bataaya he
 Kapil believes that Hardik is also a better player than him, but he needs to work hard
 
 
 
 So, is Hardik Pandyavakai proving to be a better all-rounder than Kapil Dev, popularly known as 'haryana Hurricane'? If we look at the initial 26 odis of both, it is learned that Pandya has surpassed Kapil Dev in his short career
 shuruaati 26 vanade: kapil vs pandyaballebaaji: kapil 472 ran, pandya 530 ran- 19 saal (1978) main vanade debyue karne vaale kapil dev ne apane shuruaati 26 maichon main 472 ran banaae the
 - Hardik Pandya, who made his ODI debut in 23 years (2016), has scored 530 runs in his first 26 matches
 gendbaaji: kapil 28 wicket, pandya 29 wicket- kapil ne itane vanade main apni tej gendbaaji se 28 wicket chatkaaye, vahiin pandya unase ek kadam aage hai or unke naam 29 wicket hai
 Fielding: Kapil 7 catches, Pandya 10 catches - Kapil Dev did not have any answer even in fielding
 1983 ke world cap ke final kii baat karen, to viv richards kaa kaich koun bhul saktaa he
 Kapil caught his historic catch while running backwards
 lekin shuruaati 26 maichon main yani 1982 tak kapil ne 7 kaich pakade the
 While Pandya has taken 10 catches in the same number of matches
 top score: kapil 75 ran, pandya 83 ran-kapil dev kaa shuruaati 26 vanade main ucchtam score 75 ran rahaa, jabaki utane hi maicho main pandya kaa ucchtam score 83 rahaa
 During this, Kapil Dev scored 3 half-centuries, while Pandya's bat has yielded 4 half-centuries
 chakke: kapil 10, pandya 28- chakke lagane kii baat karen, to kapil dev ne 10 chakke lagaae the, jabaki pandya ne 28 chakke laga die hai
 Also, Kapil Dev returned unbeaten 2 times during the innings, while Pandya was not out 3 times
 viraat ne pandya ko ratorat superstar bana diya, dekhie ye videokya kaha tha pandya ne-pandya ne pichley srilanka daure ke dauraan kaha tha, 'nishchit taur par meraa dhyaan apni cricket par he or main jo ban saktaa hum, vahi bananaa chahta hum
 i would be very happy if i could become even 10 percent like Kapil Dev was
 'patil ne aisa kaha tha-rashtriya chayan samiti ke purv pramukh sandip patil ne hardik pandya kii tarif to kii he, lekin kapil dev se unki tulana ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘kapil kii jagah lene ke liye unhen 200 janm lene honge
 ' enditivi ko sutron ke hawaale se khabar mili he ki is saal abu hamaja bharat main kisi bade hamale kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 The let terrorist Hamza was working to raise funds for this work and at the same time he was also recruiting terrorists to carry out the terrorist attack
 saudi arab se baithkar hi hamaja in kaamon ko anjaam de rahaa tha
 After his arrest in India, Hamza confesses that he has also worked with zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, the head of Lashkar's military operations
 yahi nahin yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki mumbai hamale ke samay karachi ke us control room main bhi hamaja maujuud tha jahaan se mumbai aatanki hamale ko anjaam diya ja rahaa tha
 It is being told that Abu Hamza was also in charge of terrorist activities of Lashkar in India
 abu hamaja ne suraksha agenciyon ko poochtacha ke dauraan bataaya he ki 26 / 11 hamale ke liye pakistan ke karachi shahar main maler−kaint chhavnee ilaake or kaidabad ke bich control room banaaya gaya tha
 There were six people in this control room
 ye lagaataar kasaab or uske saathiyon ko phone se guide kar rahe the
 Their names are Abu Al Cama, Zarar Shah, Abu Kafa, zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, Muzammil and Abu Jindal
 indian mujahidin or lashkar−e−taiyaba ke aatanki abu hamaja pichley 15 maheenon se saudi arab main rah rahaa tha
 Abu Hamza, living in Beed, Maharashtra, was living in Pakistan on a passport in Saudi Arabia
 pichley kai maheenon se bharat kii khufia agency ke teen adhikari abu par najar banaae hue the
 For his identity, the intelligence agency collected blood samples of his family from Beed through which DNA tests were carried out and Abu was identified
 gauratlab he ki abu hamaja kaa suraag pune dhamaakon ke silsile main pakade gaye lashkar ke aatanki laal baba mohammad shaikh ne poochtacha ke dauraan diya tha
 The same identified Zabiuddin's voice and said that it was Abu Jindal involved in 26 / 11
 iske baad jabiuddin ke parivaar kii shinaakht shuru hui
 Pakistan too was under full pressure against Jindal's extradition, but in the end the evidence presented by Indian officers came to fruition
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is maamle main america ne bhi saudi arab par dabaav banaaya
 At the same time, Pak High Commission has said on the issue of Abu Hamza, terrorism is a problem for both countries
 iskaa muqabla donon desh milakar hi kar sakate hai
 Pakistan has once again reiterated its support in this field
 tippaniyan Abu's arrest also matters because its capture will also make it clear how terrorists are operated from the control room of Pakistan
 vaise, kai myanon main yah giraftaar kasaab ke pakade jane ke baraabar hi he
 The search for Hamza is in many respects
 sabase zyada chaunkaane vaala cese tha bhartiya vigyaan santhaan par hamale kaa jahaan aatanki hathgole phenkane ke baad bhi bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 Now this story will also open up who helped Abu Hamza to run away? abu hamaja ne suraksha agenciyon ko poochtacha ke dauraan bataaya he ki 26 / 11 hamale ke liye pakistan ke karachi shahar main maler−kaint chhavnee ilaake or kaidabad ke bich control room banaaya gaya tha

 Modi government will make Citizenship Amendment Bill easy in Lok Sabha, but will be challenged in Rajya Sabha
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak main bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan ke hindu, jain, isai, sikh, buddha or parsi samudaay ko bhartiya naagarikta dene kaa prastaav he
 The Muslim community is singled out from this bill
 vipaksh ke tamaam dal virodh kar rahe hai
 The BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha
 aise main loksabhaa main vidheyak ko paas karana aasaan he, lekin modi sarkaar kii asal chunauti rajyasabha main honi he
 However, JDU, TRS, YSR Congress and Shiv Sena are such parties, whose attitude will depend a lot
 loksabhaa main bijepi ke paas bahumat kaa aankada he, jabaki rajyasabha main endie ke paas bahumat nahin he
 In such a situation, the Modi government will need the support of other parties to pass the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 haalanki pichley do saalon membijapi or endie kii takat rajyasabha main behtarhui he
 Apart from this, parties like BJD and AIADMK on the opposition parties can support the Modi government on the citizenship amendment bill
 bataa den ki rajyasabha main philhal sadasyon kii kul sankhya 239 he
 This means that if all members of the house vote, 120 votes will be required for majority
 agar endie ke saath un dalon kii baat karen jo endie kaa sahyog kar sakate hai to unki sambhavit sankhya 114 banati he
 These include 83 of BJP, 7 of BJD, 11 of AIADMK and 3 members of Akali Dal

 The opposition has the support of a total of 108 mps, including 46 of the Congress, 13 of the TMC, 9 of the SP, 5-5 of the CPM and DMK and 4-4 members of the RJD, NCP and BSP
 vipaksh ko purvottar rajyon se taalluk rakhane vaali kuch choti partiyon kaa samarthan bhi mil saktaa he jo is bill ke virodh main hai
 However, in the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram, the provision of inner line permits is excluded from the purview of the CAB
 in dalon par hogi najarjediu, wiesar congress or tiares jaisi partiyon kaa rukh abhi tak saaf nahin he
 In such a situation, these parties are the most watched
 haalanki, is baat kii sambhaavna kam he ki teenon hi partiyaan sarkaar ke khilaaf vot karengi
 They are either expected to vote with the government or they will not participate in voting
 in teen dalon ke paas rajyasabha main kul 13 saansad hai
 At the same time, Shiv Sena has placed a condition for support on this bill that it will support only if the right to vote is not given to those who get new citizenship for 25 years
 rajyasabha main shivasena ke paas 4 saansad hai
 However, if these parties go with the NDA, the number will increase to 127 which is more than the majority, but if they do not participate in the voting, then the majority figure will be 111
 vahiin purvottar se naata rakhane vaali party naga pipuls party ke ekmaatr saansad ke bhi voting main hissaa nahin lene kii sambhaavna he

 aap chahen maane yaa na maane par ye sach he ki jin falo or subjiyon ko ham sehat banane ke liye khate hai unhen kai prakaar kii kritrim khaadon or keet-naashkon kaa prayog karke ugaaya jaataa he
 To protect crops from damage, farmers spray pesticides in the fields
 khet se jab ye fal or subjiyan bazaar pahunchati hai to inamen in keet-naashkon ko kuch ansh chipka hi rah jaataa he
 Apart from this, many types of impurities also contain many other impurities
 in ashuddhiyon ko nangi ankhon se nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, we often swallow these impurities along with fruits and vegetables, which after a while starts to be harmful for the body

 After some time rub them out with light hands
 uske baad ek saaf bartan main unhen rakhkar istemaal main laaen

 kaarykram sthal par babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar ke katout purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or purv grih mantri laalkrishna adwani ke saath pramukhataa se lagaae gaye
 But the most shocking cutout was that of former Prime Minister and influential Jat leader of Western UP, Chaudhary Charan Singh, who did not show up in any state executive meeting after the BJP government was formed at the Center
 jaahir he, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pashchimi upi main jaateey sameekaran saadhane ke bhaajapa ke agenda kii jhalak kaarykram sthal par lage netaaon ke katout or chitra spasht kar rahe the
 In order to identify itself as the biggest flag bearer of nationalism, the BJP chose Meerut, from where the bugle of the 1857 revolution against the British was blown
 meerut main bhaajapa ke pradesh padaadhikariyon, kaarysmiti sadasyon, jiladhyakshon, jila prabhariyon samet kul 600 se adhik kaaryakartaaon ke saath shuru hui kaaryakarini baithak main pradesh main pichley kuch maheenon main gorakhpur, phulpur aurakairanasansadeey upachunaav main hui haar ko bhulaakar loksabhaa chunaav main puri takat se utarane kaa sankalp liya gaya
 The BJP, which won 71 out of 80 parliamentary seats in UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, has once again formulated a strategy of mobilization of castes to replicate this dreamy performance in the 2019 general election
 mahagathbandhan kaa khatrapichley varsh disambar main hue meyar ke chunaav main bhaajapa ko meerut main valmiki samaaj se aane vaali bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii ummidavaar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 After this, in western UP, in the Kairana Lok Sabha and Nurpur Assembly by-elections, the trend of Dalits was also shown towards the BSP
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle samaajawaadee party (sapa), basapa, rashtriya lokdal (ralod) ke sambhavit mahagathbandhan ne bhaajapa ranneetikaron kii neend uda di he
 The dalit-muslim alliance has shown its impact in the assembly and Lok Sabha by-elections
 bhaajapa ne isse nibatane ke liye aligarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu ) main aarakshan kaa mudda oochaal diya he
 In the inaugural session of the working committee, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, "tell those who call BJP anti-dalit why the scheduled class did not get reservation in Aligarh Muslim University? Why does all the political parties stop speaking on such issues? iske liye party ne sabase zyada bharosa upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury par hi jataayaa he
 Maurya has made the party's agenda clear by announcing the construction of roads in every district in the name of Karpoori Thakur, the great thinker of the Backward Class and former Chief Minister of Bihar
 maury ab pashchimi uttar pradesh main gurjar, saini, jat samet pichde varg kii un jatiyon ke saath baithak karenge jo rajnatik rup se upekshit hai
 BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Bhupendra Yadav was not without presence in the absence of UP in-charge Om Mathur in the Working Committee
 yadav votaron ke bich send lagane ke liye party bhupendra yadav ko upi prabharee kaa daayitv saunpane par vichaar kar rahi he
 For the first time on the beginning of the Kavad Yatra in West UP, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had cleared the agenda of 'hardcore Hindutva' by showering flowers with helicopters at the start of Kavad Yatra in West UP
 meerut main pradesh kaarysmiti main bhi hindutv agenda kii jhalak dikhi
 After the working committee meeting, several ministers including Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya reached Baba Oughdanath and Dharmeshwar temple in Meerut and also worshiped
 hindutv agenda ko paroksh rup se dhar dene ke liye yogi ne kaarysmiti main apane bhaashan main jor dekar kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar kisi kaa bhi tushtikaran nahin karegi
 His target was towards the Muslims
 unka ekamusth vot bhaajapa virdohi gathbandhan ke paas na jaae, iske liye party ne alpsankhyak morcha kaa nae sire se gathan kar pehali baar ise booth tak pahunchane kii taiyaari kii he (dekhen box)
 Spokesperson at the University of Meerut, Drs
 amar verma bataate hai, ''muslimon kaa vot bhaajapa ko nahin milane vaala lekin, teen talaak or halaala jaise mudde uthaakar party is vot bank main bantwaaraa karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 "on these issues, the Minority Front is going to organize programs at the Mandal level across the state
 assam main rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) ke mudde ko uchhaalkar bhaajapa rashtrawaad or hindutv kaa 'cocktail' taiyaar karne kii jugat main he
 At the conclusion of the working committee, the party's national president Amit Shah said, "refugees can live in the country but Bangladeshis, Pakistanis or any intruders will not be allowed to stay
" '' bhaajapa sabhi jilon main jila kaarysmiti kii baithken yojit kar enarasi ke mudde par janamat taiyaar karegi
 Emphasis on organization Since the formation of the BJP government in the state, the party has for the first time prepared its army for the election summer of Lok Sabha by renewing all the cells, fronts, departments and projects
 sabhi morcha adhyakshon ko lakshya saunpa gaya he (dekhen box)
 All party mps and Union Ministers of UP were invited to the Working Committee
 kendriya mantri menka gandhi or unke bete sultanpur se saansad varun gandhi ke meerut kii kaarysmiti baithak main na pahunchane se sanket mila ki party ke bheetar sab thik nahin chal rahaa
 However, reconciliation efforts have also come up
 ek duusare ke dhur virdohi rahe bhaajapa ke purv pradesh adhyaksh dow
 Laxmikant Vajpayee's stay at Meerut's residence at the organization's General Secretary Sunil Bansal's tea is an important step in the direction of repairing the party's nails
 kaarysmiti ke udghaatan satr ke manch par dow
 Vajpayee and Sunil Bansal sat side by side
 mahagathbandhan kii kaat ke liye amit shah ne upi main 'ek booth, 20 youth' kaa naaraa diya
 There should be 10 youth belonging to Dalit and backward classes
 agle do maheenon ke dauraan party shahid sammaan samaaroh, prabhaat pheri, kavi sammelan jaise kaaryakramon ke jariye chunavi abhiyaan ko gati degi
 How can the BJP, which was mobilizing castes in opposition to power by staying in the opposition, be able to mobilize the same castes in opposition to the opposition? On this success, the electoral outcome of the saffron team will be decided
 *** Union Minister Nitin Gadkari canceled all his programs and reached Nagpur in a hurry
 mana ja rahaa he ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii samay seemaa puure hone ke ek din pehle raajnneetik gatividhiyaan tej ho gai hai or sutron kaa kahana he ki nagpur main nitin gadakari sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat karenge
 Gadkari has also told NDTV that he is going to Nagpur where he will meet some people about Maharashtra
 aapako bataa den yah sab kuch aise samay ho rahaa he jab siem bijepi kaa ek pratinidhimandal aaj maharashtra ke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari se milane ja rahaa he
 Nitin Gadkari's name is also running for the post of Chief Minister of Maharashtra and it is being said that he can end the deadlock with Shiv Sena
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shivasena netaa siem devendra fadanvis ke ravaiye se kaaphi naaraaz hai jinhone khulkar unki 50-50 ko khaarij kar diya he
 Earlier, Devendra Fadnavis also met Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday
 vahiin shivasena sanjay raut ne sangh pramukh or shivasena uddhav thakare kii mulaakaat yaa baatcheet kii khabaron ko galat bataaya he
 
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki shivasena jahaan devendra fadanvis ko 'jaataa hue mukhyamantri (outgoing chief minister) bataati he to vahiin party nitin gadakari ko lekar rukh naram rahaa he
 Nitin Gadkari has been the Chief Minister in the Shiv sena-bjp government in Maharashtra earlier and he was also very close to Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray
 iske saath hi unke uddhav thakare se bhi achche sambandh hai
 Earlier, Shiv Sena Kishore Tiwari wrote a letter to Mohan Bhagwat saying that Nitin Gadkari should be asked to resolve the ongoing dispute between Shiv Sena and BJP
 aapako bataa den ki 24 oktober ko aae nateezon main bijepi ko 105 or shivasena ko 56 siten ai hai
 The alliance has also crossed the 145 figure of the lot but the Shiv Sena has demanded a 50-50 formula under which the Shiv Sena will be the Chief Minister for two and a half years and the BJP for two and a half years
 lekin siem devendra fadanvis ne saaf kaha ki puure paanch saal siem kaa pad shivasena ke hi paas rahegaa

 " On the day of the appointment of the new chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), 47 students have decided to conduct a mass buyout against the administration
 gajendra chouhan ke baad FTII ke chairman ke pad par abhinayta anupam kher kii niyukti ke saath hi phir ek baar phir vivaad shuru hone ke asaar dikhaai dene lage he
 In fact, five students studying in the second year have been expelled from FTII and asked to leave the hostel and leave the campus within three days
 second year ke baaki chaatro ko bhi karrwai kaa notice diya gaya he
 The whole controversy has started with the second year students being given only two days instead of three days to make a dialogue short film
 second year ke chaatro ko paanch-paanch ke gut main das minute kii short film banani hoti he, jiske liye in chaatro ko pehle teen din diye jate the, lekin ab is eksrasij ke liye sirf do din dene kaa nirnay FTII prashasan ne liya he
 Students are opposing this
 somvaar ko prashasan ne paanch chaatro ko shuting ke bare main charchaa karne ke liye meeting ke liye bulaayaa tha, lekin chaatro ne ek saath milakar is meeting main na jane kaa nirnay liya
 There are a total of 47 students studying in the second year
 in sabhi chaatro ne FTII keprashasan kenirnay kaa virodh karne kaa nirnay liya he
 After this, the administration of FTII has ordered five students from the first faction not coming for the meeting to leave the hostel within three days, and the remaining students have also been given notice to take action
 lekin sabhi 47 chaatro ne prashasan ke khilaaf maas bycott karne kaa nirnay liya he
 In this case none of the FTII directors or faculty members were available to talk
 abhinayta anupam kher kii niyukti ko lekar FTII students council ke purv adhyaksh muthu ne ajtak se bataaya ke jaisaaresaur is sarkaar kaa network he, or ve jin vailuj ko khatm karne kii koshish kar rahe he, usee kaa hissaa hai anupam kher
 Anupam Kher also continues to campaign openly
 ek jhooth hameshaa bade jhooth ko daavat detaa he
 Pinocchio of international relations (a fictional character whose nose was long with tension, especially at the time of lying) may not start with a small clever nose, but it quickly grows into an embarrassing caricature: the lie moves ahead of you
 osama bin laden kii maut ke chand ghanton ke bheetar asif 
 The Zardari government buried Pakistan's credibility with Osama's bones through conflicting statements
 un bayanon main ubharate tathyon ke mutabik badalane kii shaleenta bhi nahin thi
 Perhaps Pakistan believes that since it has become a battlefield, panic in the fog of war is a legitimate trick
 jaisaa ki maanav prakruti ke shandaar doctor shakespeare ne kaha tha ki jab ham fareb karne nikalate hai to ham bahut pechida jaal bun lete hai
 Opportunity comes naturally for Zardari's government, and initially his knee turns in a familiar direction, patting him on the back
 uske log yah elaan karne ke liye televijan studio kii ore bhaage ki osama ''sanyukt abhiyaan'' main maaraa gaya, jo ''aatank ke khilaaf'' lambii ''jang'' kaa sarvocch gaurav he
 Its ambassadors in London and Washington began to struggle in the media
 landan main waajid shamsul hasan ne bibisi ke saamne aisi juthi shekhi baghaari, jisaki mukhyalay se ijaajat nahin mili hogiah osama ko kuch roj pehle hi phusalaakar jaal main fansane ke liye abtabad laayaa gaya tha
 But CIA director Leon Panetta shattered this fictional tale: "it was decided that any attempt to work with Pakistanis could endanger the mission
" ve nishane ko satark kar sakate hai
 "on the other hand, John Brennan, head of counter-terrorism in the White House, said publicly," It is beyond imagination that Osama can live so long without a support system
 ''ve isse zyada spashtvaadi nahin ho sakate theah america kaa maananaa tha ki agar islamabad ko prastaavit hamale ke bare main bataa diya jaataa to vah apane ashrith, osama, ko duusari panaahagaah kii ore faraar karne main madad karata
 The CIA knew that Osama has been living under the nose of Pakistan's most important military academy in Abbottabad for almost five-six years since the house was built
 yah do or do ke jod kaa nateeja jaanane jitna aasaan tha
 That huge house with high walls and barbed wire was specially built for Osama
 somvaar shaam tak jaradaari ko yah maanane ko majaboor kar diya gaya ki unke numaayinde jhooth bol rahe the, or ki ''ravivaar kii ghatnaayen saajha muhim nahin thim
 Later, under pressure from the domestic sections, he also accused the US of violating the sovereignty of Pakistan
 yahaan ek khyaal aata haih samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan tabhi ho saktaa he jab aapane use bachaa rakhaa ho
 Zardari deliberately ignored a big question, which is now going on
 iesai koi bevakoof sanghathan to he nahin
 How he did not know that the world's most famous face of the wanted, a terrorist who incited the US to wage a major war (which currently costs $ 300 million per day), along with his wives, a dozen children and allies, five Has been living at her door for more than a year? If Islamabad knew, as some people are now claiming, then Pakistan has given Americans the whereabouts of Osama Security detection and turned instead to wait to face the consequences, the desired arresting terrorist forsaken their sovereign right to prosecute him? There are a lot of possibilities in this idea
 yadi salmaan taasir ke hatyare kaa lahore main gulab kii pankhudiyaan barasaakar swaagat kiya gaya or uskaa stutigaan kiya gaya to mukademe ke dauraan osama kii kitni prashansa kii jaati? pakistan pravesh shulk lagaakar apana rashtriya karj chukaa saktaa tha
 The tweezers shrink from both sides when you lie down
 sach pechida nahin hota
 Some general questions related to the maintenance of the house will be revealed
 osama kii aakhri (pakistani) bivi se sabase choti santan kii umr do saal he, or is tarah uski paidaaish abtabad main hui he
 Who were those doctors? Did a dozen of his children go to school or were they privately educated? Who were those tutors? Did the children never leave the house? Where did they go How did they get the money for the flocks? Would not have been received from a local bank account? Who used to pay electricity and water bills? Was it paid by cash or check? Osama was a kidney disease patient, as confirmed by Pervez Musharraf in 2002
 usne ilaaj kaise karaayaa? yah bamushkil koi lambii suchi he par yah sabit karne ke liye kaaphi he ki satta main se kisi ne, bahut mumkin he ki iesai ne osama ko sahaayta or sangrakshan diya hoga
 The US has hundreds of reasons for not relying on Islamabad, and this will deteriorate relations in the near future
 osama ko maar giraane se pehle tak baraak obama mahaj raashtrapati the; ab ve apane desh ke netaa ban gaye hai
 He has justified the Nobel Prize for Peace, which he stupidly took when he did nothing to achieve it
 lekin jeet se galati karne kii utani hi gunjaaish paidaa ho jaati he jitani haar se
 Osama was the most rotten symbol of the problem and that problem increased in the last decade
 asli khatra vyakti vishesh yaa samoohon se nahin balki us vichaardhaara se he jisane pakistan or afghanistan main gahari paith jamaa lee he, or vah taliban jaisi partiyon ke rup main saamne aa rahi haih dharmatantra kii ek madhyayugin vyakhya, jiske jariye kabul or islamabad donon jagah satta hathiyaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he or aasapaas ke ilaakon ko dooshit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Obama should choose his friends as carefully as he has chosen his enemies

 His campaign was also simple
 ab sawaal yah he ki un paidal sipaahiyon kaa kya karen jinhone unke liye ji-tod kaam kiya
 Opponents will not help them; a large proportion of minorities see the threat of the fulfillment of the rss's unfinished agenda of Hindu Rashtra in their rise, while outspoken and staunch speakers see Modi as a threat to freedom of expression
 modi ko un sab tak pahunchnaa hoga, vaise hi jaise ve ab tak keshubhai patel se lekar laalkrishna adwani sareekhe apane rajnatik pratidwandviyon ke paas pahunchate rahe hai
 They will also have to prove that along with good intellectual ability, emotional maturity is also there in them, they have a soft heart along with a strong mood

 Who can know better the pain of a person living on the outside in the center than someone who has spent many years there
 lekin modi sirf sthanik athwa bhugolic drushti se dilli darbar ke liye bahari vyakti nahin hai
 They are also socially outsiders who will not be comfortable in the English-speaking, elite here
 na hi khel ke alikhit niyamon ko aatmsaat kar paaenge jis par chalakar vyakti saarvajanik rup se nek lekin nijee jivan main aparaadhon main sahabhaagi banataa he, pichley daravaaje se len-dein ko kya modi apana sakenge? sattashin hone vaale pehle prachaarak atal bihari vaajapeyi ke parivaar kii chatukaarita karne waalon ko modi bardaasht kar paaenge?kaiyon kaa tark he ki 2014 kaa aam chunaav bharat ke do vichaaron ke bich tark tha-ek vichaar tha dharmanirpeksh bharat kaa jo vividhta kaa jashn manaata he, doosraa us vibhajit bharat kaa tha jo ekarupata ko puujata he
 Modi turned this debate into a talent show, where the talented India faced feudal India
 congress iske pratirodh main kuch nahin kah pai kyonki modi ne ek dashak se vikaas avaruddh karne, khaskar nehru-gandhi parivaar par muftakhori kii samskruti poshit karne kaa aarope lagaakar, uske paanv ke neeche se jameen pehle hi sarka di thi
 After coming to power, will the BJP abandon its commitment to Article 370, the construction of Ram temple and the introduction of a uniform civil code? Will Modi survive the pressure of the Sangh to rewrite India's history through textbooks? Will they allow a decision on India's economic agenda? For a long time, Walter Anderson, a union observer and former head of the US State Department of South Asia Division, believes that the RSS is just as intimidated by Modi's strong personality as many liberals
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘modi apane faisle khud lene vaale insaan hai
 The top officials fear that the loyalty of the workers is more to Modi than to the RSS
 ’’ unka maananaa he ki modi ko bijepi ke dakshinpanthiyon or sangh parivaar se samasya ho sakati he
 He has to deal with people like Praveen Togadia
 bada prashn yah he ki ve kaise pradhanmantri honge? sari shaktiyaan apane haath main rakhane kii chhavi ke vipareet ve satta kaa bantwaaraa kar sakate hai or karenge, lekin ve nishtha or thos parinaamon kii apeksha karte hai
 John Elliott, a well-known senior English journalist, says that Modi has been chosen not just to lead but to do something, "india does not need new policies
" ise faislon kii jarurat he
 "they believe that this is a sign of massive change
" modi ke korporate jagat ke prashansak duniya bhar main samvaad kar bharat ke bare main faili shankaaen dur karenge
 What will happen to the losers? Just pay attention to the parties whose campaign could not stand in the face of Modi's storm

 lekin andhra pradesh kaa haath se janaa to haar kii kahani kaa hissaa bhar he
 Another reason is the diminishing presence of the three power centers - weak prime minister, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, who is busy talking to himself

 Political scientist Zoya Hassan says that the government was ultimately not given credit in this fight for credit

 centre main modi sarkaar ke chauthe saal vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main apana 5waan bajet pesh kiya
 This budget has been described by the Modi government as poor, farmers, dalits, tribals and moving on the path of development
 haalanki, jetali ke bajet bhaashan main modicare jaisi nai health yojana kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya
 But from the current budget address, such words were missing, which were prominently heard in every budget
 kalaadhan2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi narendra modi ne videshon main jamaa kalaadhan ko bada mudda banaaya
 During the election campaign, Modi kept promising to bring back black money
 centre main unki sarkaar banane ke baad pehla bajet sansad main rakhaa gaya, to kalaadhan charchaa ke centre main rahaa
 However, while presenting the budget on Thursday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley did mention the fight against black money to benefit the country, but did not show much focus on it
 nai traindesh ke har bajet main nai trainon ko lekar ghoshnaaen kii jaati rahi hai
 Unmanned crossings, new lines, facilities at stations, facilities inside the train are announced in every budget
 lekin is baar ke bajet main nai train ko lekar vitt mantri ne koi khaas ghoshnaa nahin kii
 As usual, the Finance Minister has not made any announcement to run new trains on special routes in this budget
 haalanki, vitt mantri ne nai rail line, 4000 se zyada maanav crossing band karne, sirf badi linon par train chalane or is saal 700 nae rail ingine taiyaar kiye jane jaisi ghoshnaaen jarur kin
 Section 80-C is mentioned in the Investment Budget
 modi sarkaar se pehle bhi sabhi sarkaron ke bajet main is section ke tahat nai ghoshnaaen kii jaati rahi hai
 But this has not been focused on in the current budget
 isi kadi main sarkaar ne inakam tex slab main koi badlaav nahin karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kii he
 Some schemes of investment and savings are included under this

 tex choritax chori ko lekar modi sarkaar ke isse pehle ke bajet kaaphi charchaa rahi he
 But it was rarely mentioned in the current budget
 haalanki, arun jetali ne tex collection main badhotaree kaa jarur bakhaan kiya
 Cheap expensive: What will be expensive and cheap, there has always been a focus in the budget
 lekin maujuuda bajet main custom duty badhane se mahange hone vaale do-chaar saamaan hi charchaa main aae
 Whereas during the budget, a large list of things related to everyday life has been declared to be expensive and cheap
 is baar exise duty or saamaanon par lagane vaala tex jiesti ke daayre main chalaa gaya he
 This is the reason why you have not got to see cheap and expensive budget this time

 Seeing the growing skepticism recorded on the basis of the satellite picture, the Moga administration ordered an inquiry
 We have often heard that the pictures do not lie, but many pictures of Punjab's fields taken from the satellite are lying white
 yah aarope kisaanon kaa he
 In fact, many farmers in Punjab have been accused of burning the fire just because the smoke from their fields is seen in the pictures taken from the satellite, while it is alleged that smoke came from the neighbors' farm
 paraali jalaane kii tasveeron ko sach maanakar moga ke sarjan doctor anup sood or unke bhai ajay sood ko paraali jalaane kaa aaropee maan liya gaya he, jabaki aarope yah he ki paraali selina gaanv ke ek kisaan ne jalaai thi

 All this is amazing of the pictures taken from the satellite, who only sees the smoke, he does not know where the smoke is coming from

 On the other hand, the Moga district administration has ordered an inquiry against the innocent farmers taking seriously the matter of cutting the challan burning stove

 BJP had removed him from the post of Chief Secretary, saying that he listens more to Aam Aadmi Party workers

 But the revelations that are happening now are shocking because Headley had not only five, but also many other cities and he had hidden two secrets
 taaja khulaasa ye he ki hedli ne mumbai samet sirf paanch shaharon kii hi nahin 20 se zyada shaharon kii khaak chhaani thi or uske nishane par pune or kochi bhi the
 David Hedley, an American citizen of Pakistani origin, prepared and returned a full raw sheet of all the important places in the cities
 or shaq he ki mumbai main reki bhi usee se karwaai gai thi
 According to sources, Headley joined lashkar-e-taiba in 2006 and he got his first passport as soon as he joined Lashkar
 uskaa passport america se jari kiya gaya or uskaa number- 097536400 he
 Headley's real name Dawood Geelankhas is that in this passport, he entered his Muslim name David Coleman Headley in place of Dawood Gilani like an Englishman
 america naagarik or angrejon jaisaa naam hone kaa hedli ko bahut hi phayda mila
 He kept going from one corner of the country to the other
 aatank kii khaufnak sajeesh rachataa rahaa
 While the security agencies of the country remained unaware of this and a dangerous terrorist enjoyed hospitality in the country
 pakistani sena se bhi jude the hedli ke taralashkar ke aatankwaadi david hedli ke taar pakistan kii sena se bhi jude the, ye khulaasa hua he aatanki ke email se
 David has also confessed that he used to dodge the security agencies with his email
 padtaal ye bhi kii ja rahi he ki david ke taar mumbai hamalon se jude the yaa nahin
 David Headley was in touch with Lashkar's bosses in Pakistan through e-mail, phone, chat, long distance calling cards
 yahi nahi to wo kai baar unhe milane pakistan or khadi deshon main bhi jaaya karata tha
 After investigating Headley's intercepted e-mails, the FBI itself admitted that Headley had a lot of computer knowledge
 dar asal tahawwur rana ne hedli ko 4 march 2009 main bheje ek imail main kiya tha jab rana ne apane in dono bhaiyon kaa zikr hedli se kiya tha
 Rana named his two brothers as Brigadier Mowadat Hussain Rana and Sibte Hasan Rana Moni
 usne ye bhi kaha tha ki wo rawalpindi ke rahane vaale hai
 Following Rana's e-mail, David received an initial alphabet of his name, mov from an IP address in Chicago on March 6, 2009
 monie@yahoonama kaa i-mail taiyaar kiya
 On the same day he accessed this e-mail from an IP address of UAE and sent an e-mail to Tahawwur Rana and asked him to contact one of his handlers 
 bharat main hedli ke khilaaf maamla darj28 agast ko hedli ne lashkar ke apane aakaa se phone par baatcheet main apane naye i-mail idi ke bare main bataaya or kaha ki aage se wo isi se unase sampark main rahegaa
 Also, Headley also asked his mentor of Lashkar to create a new email account by adding the name of his younger brother and one of his companions
 3 oktober ko pakistan ke liye ravaanaa hote vakt hedli ne rana ko phone par kaha ki wo jimail par liaqatwing11 ke naam se ek i-mail acount banaae
 Afbi's ears have also cropped up after listening to the reference of Pakistan's Brigadier and Rana's brother
 afabiai ye pataa lagaana chaahati he ki aakhir in dono kaa naam kaa zikr aakhir rana ne hedli se kyon kiya
 Because he suspects that Rana has also met Headley in Pakistan with his brother Brigadier Monadat Rana
 beharhaal bharat main hedli ke khilaaf maamla darj ho gaya he or jald hi jaanch agency enie bhi epabiai ke daavon kii tarz par jaanch main jute jaayegi

 - input bhashaa As soon as Saraa was popular, we told you about the potential dangers of this app
 ise khatra yaa data kii chori kah sakate hai
 Saraha is an app through which a message can be sent to its user without revealing the identity of the sender
 koi bhi ap aap apane smartphone main install karte hai to wo kuch parmishan kii maang karata he
 There is also an app that asks for some permission while installing
 aamtaur par eps install hote vakt aise parmitions kii mangakarte hai jinaki unhen jarurat hoti he
 But if an app takes such permission from you, that app is not needed, then it will definitely be a surprise
 saraahaa install karte samay aapse aapaki puri contact list maangi jaati he
 But the question arises that if the Saraa app does not need your contacts then why is it demanded from you? According to a report by The Intellect, senior security analyst Jacquerie Junion found the Saraa app sending it to a personal contact server
 unhone is ap ko apane Galaxy S5 main install kiya jisamen android kaa purana varjan 5
 1
 1 he
 He analyzed this phone with a monitoring suit named BURP Suit
 yah tul yah pataa karata he ki phone ke honor kaa data kahaan transfar kiya ja rahaa he
 After running this software, when Julian opened the app of appreciation, he discovered through this software that the data collected by Saraa is being uploaded to the server
 unhone kaha he, ‘jaise hi aap is ap main log in karte hai yah aapke android smartphone main store data jaise email or phone contacts ko transmit kar detaa he’
 They have also tested such a new version on Android and ios
 ap parmishan ke ghalmail kaa ek bada udhaaharan ubar ap bhi he
 The company released an update last year
 isamen yugers se aisi parmishan lee ja rahi thi jo kaaphi hairaani bhari thi
 Because Uber had put such an option under which the location of the customers will continue to be tracked even if the user is not using Uber
 is report ke baad saraahaa ap ke founder jan-al aabedin kipratikriya bhi ai he
 He has said that users' contacts will be removed in the coming time
 unke mukabik aane vaale samay main found yor frends naam kaa feechar launch kiya jayega or isliye hi contacts kii parmishan lee gai he
 After the response, he has told The Intercept that the partner he was working with no longer works with him and that he was about to remove this feature from this app but it did not happen by mistake
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha he ki ab ye function hataa liya gaya he or saraahaa apane database main koi contact nahin rakhata
 Let us tell you that most of the apps on the App Store and Google Play Store are such that when installing, such permission is also sought from the users, which the app does not need
 lekin jab unase poocha jataa he ki ye parmishan kyon lee ja rahi he to wo kehete hai ki ye aapaki marji he agar aap chahen to parmishan na den
 However, most apps do not work without special permission, so they have to be forced to install them
 jain-al aabedin ne is khabar ke baad aaj tak ke baatcheet main bataaya he ki agle apadet se contact request khatm kar liye jaaenge
 We have talked to cyber security experts on this matter
 unhone bataaya he ki eps kai baar aapse aise parmishan bhi lete hai jinaki jarurat unhen baad main hoti he
 However, before installing the app, it appears on your screen what permission the app takes from you
 saraahaa ap ne bhi aisa hi kiya he

 Greetings, you can do according to yourself, first of all tell us who we are
 ham us peedi se aate hai jise sach main nahin pataa ki pehle mahilaon par purushon ne kitne atyaachaar kiye,kyon kiye yaa kaise kiye? ham uskaa hissaa nahin rahe isliye koi aparadhbodh bhi nahin he, nahin he maane nahin he
 dalit-damit-abla etc
 give a big pathetic feel when listening and words like 'purushpradhan Samaj' or 'pitra Shakti' should keep a weight of two numbers in our exam, even then we will not be able to tell its meaning
 phir uskaa hissaa banane kii baat hi or rahi
 We have come from a generation for whom there were no girls, girls or women
 matlab hamaare liye aap thim hameshaa se
 Tiffin used to eat with us in the nursery on the side benches
 gulabi tiffin vaali wo bacchiyaan kabhi hauvva nahin lagi
 The tunic we wore wearing half pants
 tab sar logon se zyada mam kii class hoti thim
 She used to get good, she used to get scolded too
 kabhi-kabhi mam kii jagah mummy nikal jaataa
 Used to be the same
 puri class hansatii mam muskura deteen
 How did you feel? isliye ham to kabhi ye kabhi soch hi nahin sakate ki auraten bas ghar main baithne ko hai
 Then grew up our pants with long pink tiffin girls in skirts
 ab bhi wo tiffin khaatin jab
 She would have eaten tiffin, we would have been playing gippy-ball with a ball of socks
 fark bas ye padaa tha ki ab unke saamne maar pad jaati to insalt zyada mahasoos hoti
 Were forgotten 
 
 mahila diwas kii shubhakamanaayenye mahila diwas, gajab din he sach main
 Well, it should be a day for women too
 general nolej kaa ek jawaab hi taiyaar ho jaataa he
 Catchy updates come on Facebook
 duniya baaki dinon main chaahe jaisi ho us din bas do kheme main banty najar aati he
 The one who feels that every year girls get top only because copies are checked mam and give more number to girls
 inkaa bas chale to duniya bhar kii bacchiyon ko, ladakiyon ko, auraton ko saat tahkhaanon ke neeche bandakar aaen
 They also have problems with girls laughing, reading, writing, learning and understanding and taking the most important decisions
 duusare wo jinke liye mahila shashaktikaran kaa matlab auraton ke ek haath main bottle or duusare main cigarette he
 According to them, all the women of the world are not strong unless they smoke cigarettes like boys in the open
 bin-byaahi maaen nahi banati
 Ten-ten does not make boyfriends
 aisa samajhie ki auraten apane faisle lene ko aaazaad he jab wo inke kahe anusaar apane faisle lene lagen
 Such people are called feminists
 ham diplomatic nahi hona chaahate par sab jaanate hai nicotine sabake liye kharaab hoti he
 If the habits are bad then the mother tells her friends to change
 baaki daaru-bidi yaa garlfriend-bwoyfriend koi badi baat nahin he or shashaktikaran kaa paryaay to katai nahin
 Everyone has their own story going on in their minds
 Believe no one except you, no matter how much you can drink or how many boyfriends you have
 ladanaa acchhee baat he par parchhaayi se nahin
 It feels bad when we are wrapped up in the whole group and are deemed lustful or rapist
 ummid kii jaati he sir jhukaakar hi kah denge, kai to maan bhi lete hai
 This is his character's weakness, for him to wear girls' jeans was ruckus, but we will not agree
 hamen stand lenaa aata he
 It is wrong to say wrong, it is disgusting to read a shoddy non-way jokes, our virginity is not disturbed by seeing a strip of bra, looking at the sleeveless top and a six and a half inch skirt, hormones do not flutter, seeing the girl holding the boy's hand, our effigies It is not wide, we have always seen it all around us
 ab fark padana band ho gaya he aam bate hai ye
 
 jitna aam hamaara hona yaa aapkaa hona
 We come from a great generation
 Our canvas shoes are fastened with black thread at the behest of our mother
 to mahila diwas par ye ki acha he aap log hai hamaare aas-paas, mummy-buaa-mam-garlfriend, padosan-sahyatri-sahakarmi kisi bhi rup main
 All of you are very beautiful

 ek kaarykram ke dauraan ek dalit yuvak ne mantri ko kaale kapade dikhaa kar virodh darj karaayaa
 The protesting youth had said that the NDA government Dalit leaders are maintaining silence against the atrocities on their society
 bataa den ki athavle bhi dalit samudaay se aate hai
 In fact, Ramdas Athawale was counting the achievements of the central government during a program when a Dalit youth stood behind his chair
 kendriya rajyamantri media ke saamne bol rahe the, tabhi is yuvak ne apni jeb se kaala kapadaa nikaala or unki taraf phenkate hue narebaaji shuru kar di
 It all happened in front of the media
 mantri kaa virodh karne vaale yuvak kaa naam kunal sonwane he
 However, it is being told that the mother of the opposing youth Kunal is a Congress councilor from ward number 18 of Surat Mahanagar Palika

 Athawale, at the same time, called this protest a conspiracy
 yah puraa vakya media ke camaron ke saamne hi hua
 Leader of the Republican Party of India, Ramdas Athawale, said that the equation in Gujarat elections got messed up because Hardik Patel misguided his society and motivated him to move towards Congress and that is why BJP suffered
 bataa den ki bijepi ko pichley vidhaan sabha chunaavon kii tulana main 2017 ke chunaav main nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Ramdas Athawale said that Rahul Gandhi is dreaming of becoming PM, but Congress will not come to power
 gujarat main rahul gandhi ne acha prardashan kiya he, uski vajah hardik patel hai
 The minister also said that if Hardik Patel wants reservation for his society, then he should support Narendra Modi's NDA government

 But how safe has the Dalit society been in the last 60 years? It is not good to do politics on Dalit society
 congress ne apane shashan main daliton ke liye kya kiya, sarkaar ko salaah dene kaa adhikaar rahul gandhi ko he, lekin anshan se kya hoga
 35-year-old head constable Hirojit Singh, accused of a fake encounter in Imphal, has confessed his crime
 singh ne kaha he ki july 2009 main varisht adhikari ke kehane par usne 22 saal ke sanjit singh par goli chalaai thi or sanjit us vakt nihattha tha
 According to a report in the English newspaper 'indian Express', disclosing for the first time the planned fake encounter, Hirojit has admitted that the suspicious understanding of the People's Liberation Army on which Sanjit was shot was 'unarmed' at that time
 Was
 usko khatm karne kaadeshus samay imphal west ke adishnal espi or philhal imphal west ke espi ke pad par baithe jhaalajeet singh ne die the
 Fellow policemen had said that Sanjit had fired the bullet, remembering the events of the day, Hirojit said that he had received a message on the police wireless while eating food, informing that an encounter was going on near Bir Tikendrajit Park
 us jagah kii taraf badhate hue use kuch pulicekarmiyon ne bataaya tha ki unke rokane par sanjit ne unki team pargoli chalaa dithi
 Sanjit was spoken to at his behest
 tabhi uske mobile par ek phone aayaa jisamen koi shaks use bachaa lene kii baat kah rahaa tha
 The Additional SP had said- finish it and tells him Hirojit, 'then the Additional SP reached there, i told him the whole thing after which he ordered me to finish the Sanjit
 jiske baad maine jaakar usko chah yaa satagoliyaan marithi
 Then the policemen came and took his body
 ' Some of the last poignant images of Girish Karnad are made of resistance meetings where he was seen arriving at the 'main Bhi Urban Naxal' and 'not in My Name'
 80 saal kii umr main apni lagaataar badi hoti shaareerik vyaadhiyon ke bich vah agar in sabhaaon main lambii duuri tay kar pahunchate the, to isliye nahin ki unamem kisi taatkaalik raajnneetik pratirodh kaa shauk yaa junun tha, balki isliye ki vah jis bahulata, vividhta or swatantraaa ko bhartiya chetana kaa mulya maanate rahe, us par bad rahe khatre kaa unhen gambhirtha se ehsaas tha
 But the real value of Girish Karnad is much bigger than these resistance meetings
 unke naatakon main bhartiya chetana kii prashnakulata apane shikhar par dikhaai padati he
 Using the tools of myth and history, he encounters contemporary reality and very poignantly points at socio-political irony
 'hayvadan' jaisi jatil katha or sanrachana vaala naatak hindi yaa bhartiya bhashaaon main hi nahin, duniya ke rangamanch main durlabh he
 In this play he points to multiple duality simultaneously - the duality of mind and body, the duality of humanity and animalism, the duality of love and devotion and ultimately the duality of man's relationship with God
 isi tarah 'tughlaq' main vah udaartaa or sanak ke bich jhulate ek mahatvakankshi shaasha ke bahaane satta or janata ke rishton, darbari samskruti kii patanshiltaa or ek banate-bikharate desh kii traasadee ko kai konon se dekhte hai
 In 'rakta Kalyan' he raises the story of poet Vasavanna and then raises many questions related to power and expression
 beshak, girish karnad kii ek pratishtha hindi filmon ke kalakaar ke taur par bhi rahi
 U
 aar
 He made his film debut in Ananthamurthy's novel 'sanskar', playing the role of Praneshacharya
 '70 ke dashak main jo samanaantar cinema viksit hua, usamen vah kai ahm bhoomikaaon main nazar aae
 His roles in 'nishant' and 'manthan' are still remembered
 yah unki swaabhaavik abhinay kshamta kaa kamaal tha ki unhen vyavsaayik filmon main bhi bharpoor bhoomikaayen or pahchaan milti rahi
 The new generation will probably remember him through films like 'ek Tha Tiger'
 lekin phir doharaana hoga ki girish karnad kaa asli mol rangamanch ko unke yogadan main nihit he
 What we call Indian plurality is the medium in which it has been expressed in a very true sense
 '60, '70 or '80 ke dashakon main hindi, marathi, bangla, kannada jaisi bhashaaon main achaanak ek saath kai naatakkaar ubhare, jinhen akhil bhartiya sweekruti or saraahna mili
 The names of theater-goers such as Mohan Rakesh, Dharamvir Bharti, Lakshminarayan Lal, Shankar Sesha from Marathi, Vijay Tendulkar, Mahesh Elkunchawar from Bangladesh, Badal Sarkar and Shambhu Mitra from Bangla, and Girish Karnad and Bava Karant from Kannada are constantly noted
 Wrote plays that were played extensively outside their languages
 beshak, inamen mohan rakesh, dharmaveer bharti, badal sarkaar or girish karnad apane anya samakalinon se alag or bade nazar aate hai
 The departure of Girish Karnad is the breaking of the last link in this connection
 girish karnad lagaataar sakriy the or kinhin duusare samakalinon ke muqaabale zyaada mukhar bhi
 He spoke very boldly and generally did not care for criticisms
 kuch saal pehle unhone rabindranath tagore ko doum darje kaa naatakkaar bataaya, to tagore ke bahut saare prashansak aahat or maayoos hue
 There is no doubt that there was an excess in Karnad's commentary, but it can also be undeniably believed that Gurudev is as big in his novels, in his ideological writings and in his songs, perhaps in spite of his certain revolutionary stories
 Not in girish karnad kaa ishaara sambhawatah is ore rahaa ho ki aadhunik rangamanch kii shilpagat jatilta or uske failaav ko dekhte hue tagore ke naatak kuch peeche chhot jate hon
 However, Karnad is no more
 is daur main unka janaa kuch or udhaas karata he

 But in all these different BJP preparations, no one wants to leave the core
 deepawali aane main kaaphi der he lekin loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue dilli main bijepi kamaldeep tyohaar manaayegi
 This means that all the toilets built in Delhi or built in homes, there will be lit a lotus lamp one day

 However, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has rejected the report card and said that there is no such thing as feedback from mps, but Nirmala Sitharaman will take stock of the party's preparations from every Lok Sabha constituency workers, Lok Sabha in-charge and extensionists

 chunaav ayog ne rajasav vibhaag kii ore se die gaye us jawaab ko ashishtaaamana he, jisamen ayog ne vibhaag ko salaah di thi ki chunaav ke dauraan uski inakam tex or idi jaisipravartan agenciyon kii koi bhi karrwai nishpaksh evam bhedbhaav rahit honi chahie
 The Election Commission did not expect the revenue department to respond the way it did
 rajasav vibhaag ne naseehat dene ke andaajamen ayog se kah diya ki chunaav main kalaadhan rokane kii jimmedaari ayog ke saath-saath pravartan agenciyon kii bhi he
 Therefore, ask the officials engaged in your election to act on the information about the use of black money
 yah baat ayog ko nagavar gujri he
 The Commission said, "the Election Commission expresses its extreme indignation at the informal and mild response given by the Revenue Department on the advice given by it to be completely impartial and non-discriminatory
 salaah ko lagu karne ke tareekon kaa byoraa dene kii bajaae vibhaag ne ulte salaah de daali
 "to which the Election Commission stated" expresses great dismay at the violation of established etiquette and the tone and manner used to address a constitutional authority "
 ayog ne kaha, “isliye ayog rajasav vibhaag ko anuchit tippanee karne ke liye fatkaar lagaataa he or ummid karata he ki ayog kii taraf se ukt paraamarsh main jari kiye gaye nirdeshon kaa aksharsh: paalan hoga
 Significantly, the raid on the hideouts of the people close to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath had raised questions, saying that the opposition was being harassed by doing so during the elections
 jiske baad ayog ne pravartan agenciyon kaa niyantran karne vaale rajasav vibhaag se kaha tha ki koi bhi karrwai bhedbhaav rahit honi chahie
 In fact, the Election Commission had suggested in a letter dated April 7 to Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey that any action by its enforcement agencies during the election should be fair and non-discriminatory
 saath hi aisi kisi bhi karrwai ke bare main chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ko suchit karne ko kaha
 This suggestion of the Election Commission has come after the Income Tax Department raided opposition politicians and people associated with them in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh on Sunday in Madhya Pradesh and in the last few days

 ICC President Sharad Pawar has made it clear that if suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi is found guilty of corruption, he will have to bear the consequences and there is no question of 'defending' him
 pavaar ne kaha ki haal ke bhrashtachar scandle ne ipel kii chhavi kuch had tak kharaab kii he or modi ko apni vivadaspad kaaryastylee kii keemat chukaani pad rahi he, jise bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon ne pasand nahin kiya
 Asked if he would defend Modi if he was found guilty of financial irregularities during the run of the IPL, Pawar said, "there is no question of saving anyone

 In such a situation, people are facing difficulties in buying goods
 bade or madhyam treders to jaise-taise petm yaa debit credit se bhuktan kar rahe hai

 Encouraged by a massive nine-wicket win in the first match, India will try to keep their dominance on England by trapping England in the spin net in the second cricket Test match starting on Friday
 england ke khilaaf chaar match kii is siries ko badla ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he tathaa bharat pehle hi 1-0 se aage ho gaya he
 Another win will ensure Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team that England will not be able to win the series on Indian soil after 27 years
 isse bharat brownwaash karne or pichley saal england kii dharti par mili 0-4 kii haar kaa badla chuktaa karne kii raah par bhi aage bad jayega
 If skipper Alastair Cook and wicketkeeper Matt Prior left the innings, then India beat England in every division in the first match played at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad
 in donon ne england kii duusari pari main kram se 176 or 91 ran banaaye the
 The rest of his batsmen could not stand in front of Indian spinners, especially left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, who took nine wickets
 vankhede stadium main shuukravaar se hone vaala match isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki yah virendra sahvaag kaa 100waan test match hoga
 He will be the ninth Indian batsman to reach this milestone
 pehle test main 117 ran banane vaale is visphotak ballebaaj kii farm is match or siries kaa parinaam tay karne main kaaphi ahm hogi
 India, however, may have to land without pacer Umesh Yadav
 motera main atirikt oochaal hasil karne ke prayaas main unki peeth ke nichle hisse main dard ubhar gaya tha
 Ishant Sharma could be replaced in the playing eleven
 yadi yadav nahin khel pate hai to jahir ke saath ishanth nayi gend sambhaal sakate hai
 He suffered from viral fever during the first Test match
 yadav ke chotil hone ke kaaran ashok dinda ko rigerv ke taur par team se joda gaya he
 Off-spinner r Ashwin is also likely to remain a team
 unhone england kii duusari pari main haalanki 100 se adhik ran diye or keval greem swaan kaa wicket liya
 Ashwin's stay in the team means that Harbhajan Singh will have to stay out
 bhartiya ballebaaj behtareen farm main hai
 If Sehwag was successful in scoring his first century in two years, then young Cheteshwar Pujara hit an unbeaten double century

 It could also be his last Test match at his home ground

 There could be a change in the Indian team due to Yadav's injury
 unke alaava vijayi team main kisi anya badlaav kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Meanwhile, the absence of Ian Bell has weakened England's batting
 bel pehle test main haalanki naakaam rahe the
 He is going to have his first child and hence he has returned home
 unke sthaan par baayen haath ke ballebaaj eon morgan ko liya ja saktaa he
 England had expected an extra bounce on the Indian pitches from Steven Finn, who was six feet seven inches tall but suffered a thigh injury during practice and is still not fit

 It will be interesting to see if left-arm spinner Monty Panesar is retained in the team
 unhen ahmedabad main nahin khilaayaa gaya tha
 He took his first Test wicket as Tendulkar on the same ground six years ago

 On the one hand, while a series of allegations and counter-allegations are going on in the BJP and Congress regarding the Rafale fighter plane deal in India, on the other hand a shocking news is coming out, which is a danger bell for India
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik pakistan ke payalton ko rafel fiter plane udaane kii training di ja rahi he
 However, Dassault Aviation, the French company that produces this fighter plane, has denied any such information
 lekin khabaron kimaane toexange program ke tahat pakistan ke payalton ko katar airforce kii ore se rafel fiter plane koudane kii training france mendi gai he, jise farvari main hi katar ko saunpa gaya he
 On the other hand, an independent website ainonline focused on the aviation sector news
 com main chhapi khabar ke mutabik pakistani payalton ke pehle batch ko november 2017 main training di gai thi
 Let us tell you that Qatar was assigned the first Rafale fighter plane on 6 February
 dasolt se mili jaankaree ke mutabik katar ne may 2015 main 24 rafel kharidne ke liye samjhauta kiya tha
 After this, in December 2017, he ordered 12 more Rafale fighter planes

 It is believed that they were also used in the recent failed attack on India
 pakistan se sanchalit news website www
 thenews
 com
 pk had published a report in January 2018 that Qatar Air Force commander has visited the Pakistan Air Force headquarters in Islamabad
 is dauraan pakistan kii ore se donon deshon ke sainya samarthan or military training kii baat kahi thi
 There is a dispute about the Rafale deal in India
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa aarope he ki pradhanmantri modi ne rafel fiter plane kaa sauda tay keemat se zyada kiya he or isko bharat main banane ke liye echeel ko kontract na dekar anil ambani ko de diya
 The Rafale fighter plane will be delivered to India in September this year, but the news of training Pakistan pilots is disturbing
 kyonki jin kshamtaaon las rafel bharat ko saunpa ja rahaa he lagbhag unheen khoobiyon vaala vimaan katar airforce ko bhi saunpa gaya he
 The disadvantage of this is that the pilots of Pakistan will at least know how to defend against the Rafale attack
 is vimaan kii sabase badi khaasiyat iske radar hai
 This allows the pilot to target and conduct multiple attacks simultaneously
 training ke dauraan pakistan ke payalat isaki sateek kaaryastylee or system ke bare main jaan jaaenge jinka istemaal bhartiya vayusena karegi

 Jaganmohan Reddy's bail plea dismissed
 nyaayamurti bi
 Seshasayan Reddy reserved his order on Thursday
 somvaar ko unhone yachika khaarij kar di
 Kadapa MP Jagan had filed a bail plea on the ground that even after the statutory period of 90 days accusing him, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had failed to formally file charges against him
 vaise nyaayadhish sibiai kii is baat se sahamat the ki jagan ko jamaanat nahin di ja sakati kyonki unke maamle main 90 din kii sanvidhik avadhi kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 The CBI told the court that Chief Minister Y

 Rajasekhara Reddy's son Jagan was arrested only in the Venpik Sauda case
 sibiai ne kaha ki anya maamalon main jaanch jari he

 The rift in the party has been sealed with the letter of Aam Aadmi Party Lokpal Admiral Ramdas
 ramdaas ne aarope lagaaya he ki top leadership main samvaad khatm sa ho gaya or party ke bheetar do gut ban gaye hai
 On the other hand, Yogendra Yadav said in a way that while agreeing to these things, the Lokpal said that the Lokpal is above the national executive
 unki kahi baaten nyaayik hai orparty ke liye ise maananaa zaruri he
 Barely two weeks after AAP convenor and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came to power, former Navy chief and party's internal ombudsman Admiral Ramdas made a recommendation to the Political Consultative Committee (PAC) in a letter last week before the national executive meeting
 That any criticism about the internal democracy of the party should be dealt with by an independent group that conducts internal accounts The Rikrsha
 ramdaas ne sawaal uthaaya he ki agar mukhyamantri or rashtriya sanyojak ek hi hoga to kya vah zimmedaari thik se uthaa paaegaa? unhone kaha, 'hamen acha lage yaa bura, lekin ye maananaa hoga ki ham ek rashtriya party hai or ham khud ko dilli tak simit nahin rakh sakate
 ' ramdaas ke mutabik pichley chah se aath maheenon main party kii top leadership main aapasi samvaad khatm sa ho gaya he
 According to him, two groups have formed in the Aam Aadmi Party, that is why stories of conspiracy are being heard
 admiral ramdaas ne yahaan tak likh diya ki maujuuda halaat dikhaate hai ki hamaari party bhi unheen partiyon jaisi he jinaki ham aalochana karte rahete hai
 The letter also said that AAP should strive to be a truly women-sensitive party, as neither its PAC nor its leadership has any women members in the Delhi government
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vivaad ko dekhte hue arvind kejariwal ne rashtriya sanyojak pad se istifa bhi de diya tha, jise rashtriya kaaryakarini ne sweekaar nahin kiya or nai kaaryakarini banane kaa adhikaar kejariwal ko hi de diya
 Nobody is saying anything openly on all these issues, but political enthusiasts are giving information about the atmosphere

 sangh-bijepi kii samanvay baithak ke baad sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat samet sangh or bijepi ke sabhi sheersh netaaon ne adwani se alag-alag mulaakaat kii thi
 But seeing his intention to stay firm and register a formal protest in the parliamentary board meeting, Rajnath Singh once made up his mind to declare Modi as the prime ministerial candidate without a board meeting
 sangh kii ore se unhen aisa na karne kii hidaayat di gai, kyonki aisa karne se saaf taur par bijepi ke bant jane kaa sandesh jaataa
 But like Goa, Advani did not become part of Modi's name announcement this time
 unhone baithak ke fouran baad chitthee likhakar rajnath kii kaaryastylee par etraj jataayaa
 How Modi won the party Finally, despite the opposition of his political mentor Advani, Modi won the 'delhi Fort' of the party
 yaad kiijie disambar, 2012
 Modi's hat-trick in the Gujarat assembly elections suddenly changed the mood of the country
 modi ne yah chunaav isi sandesh ke saath ladaa tha ki is baar kaa vot unhen mukhyamantri nahin, pradhanmantri banane ke liye he
 He gave a post-victory speech in Hindi instead of Gujarati and addressed national issues
 chunaav se pehle ke dinon main sangh se modi ke rishte behatar nahin the
 Modi, who was the General Secretary of the organization in BJP, understood the importance of Sangh Parivar closely
 so, sangh se gile-shikave dur karne kii koshish bhi unhone vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hi shuru kar di
 He also got success
 aktubar, 2012 main nagpur main sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ke saath unki lambii baithak hui
 Departing from there, Modi declared, "my meeting with the Sangh chief was fruitful
 ” sangh bhi tab tak yah mahasoos karne laga tha ki party kii duusari peedi main modi hi behatar vikalp hai
 He was hesitant about Modi's style of functioning
 apni isi kaaryastylee ke natijatan modi ne gujarat main sanghathan ko bouna kar diya tha or sthaneey sangh-vihip netaaon se unke rishte kadavaahat bhare the
 a leader associated with the Sangh says, "modi is arrogant and rude, but at this time there is no other option than him
" sangh parivaar kii apni kaarypaddati he, jisase satta main aane ke baad un par niyantran kiya ja saktaa he
 "the central BJP had no role in the Gujarat assembly elections, (there was no communication relationship between Modi and then BJP president Nitin Gadkari), but Modi came to Delhi after the victory in the election, first of all reached the party headquarters at Ashok Road
 
 modi ne yaad dilaayaa tha ki kaise ve isi daftar ke ek chote-se kamare main rahaa karte the or aaj ve jo kuch bhi hai, party kii vajah se
 Modi, who always talked about the development of Gujarat and 6 crore Gujaratis, also changed his broadening strategy
 apane bhaashan centre sarkaar kii aalochana par kendrit kar ve 130 karod bharatiyon ke vikaas kii baat karne lage
 Modi made good use of the increasing influence of social media
 mukhyamantri nivas main emb-ity visheshgy yuvaaon kii fouj khadi kar di, jinhen kisi bhi netaa se baat nahin karne kii sakht hidaayat thi
 The army of these youth is engaged day and night in promoting the brand Modi on social sites like Twitter, Facebook
 is tarkeeb se jab modi nukkad-chauraahon kii charchaa ban gaye to bijepi ne pehle unhen kendriya chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa chairman banaakar sandesh dene kii koshish kii
 The Sangh has a major contribution in Modi's victory over the party, but a bigger role than that is his own projection as Brand Modi, in which the role of the corporate world has been important
 2009 main jab adwani bijepi kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar the, tabhi udyogpatiyon ne saarvajanik manch se modi ko project karne kii salaah di thi
 a similar projection increased his popularity, especially among BJP workers
 is lokapriyata ne bijepi ke duusare daavedaaron kaa kad bouna kar diya
 Hatric had a natural effect on Modi's stature in the Gujarat elections
 duusari ore, bijepi ke pitrupurush adwani party main hi kamjor padate gaye or sansad main party kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale donon bade netaaon sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali kii aapasi ladaai ne modi kii dilli kii raah aasaan kar di
 However, Jaitley gradually became fully modem on seeing the opportunity, while Sushma joined Advani in the opposing camp
 samachar jagat kii surkhiyon or dilli kii chahal-pahal se lambey samay ke aatmanirvaasan ke baad buudhvaar ko anna hajaare kii aawaaj sunai di
 The 77-year-old soldier said in his village Ralegan Siddhi in Maharashtra that he would not say anything to his disciple and another partner of the Magsaysay League, Kiran Bedi, to enter politics
 saath hi yah bhi kah diya ki ve lokapal kaa andolan apane dam par chalaa lenge
 But will it really happen? It was because of the pmo's mistake that Anna and Kejriwal parted ways! Let's go back before finding answers
 lokapal tab bada mudda nahin tha
 In March 2011, Anna came to Delhi and informed the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that if he does not bring the Lokpal soon, he will sit in Delhi
 dilli main unki baat ko gambhirtha se lene vaale tab bahut kam the
 Everyone remembers how things changed after that
 april 2011 main vyavastha or halaat se tang lakhon log anna or unki kathith team main aashaa kii chingaariyaan dekhne lage
 The intoxication of 'main bhi anna, tu bhi anna' came upon the country
 sarkaar unke saamne jhuk gai
 The Parliament, which was uprooted by the slightest talk, sat for hours to discuss this old man and had a serious discussion
 sab kuch upar jaataa dikhataa rahaa
 But in 2012, Anna's confidence in her colleagues only diminished
 raajnneetik paryaay kaa naaraa dene ke baad anna do din baad apni baat se palat gaye
 Leaving Kejriwal & Co
 alone to form a political party
 kejariwal party banaakar aage nikal gaye, anna raajnneeti karne kaa vaada karne ke baad thithak gaye
 First of all, Kejriwal's politics rose, he strongly condemned Kejriwal in Aaj Tak agenda program
 unke shabd itane kathor ho gaye ki khamosh or vinamr kejariwal ko ulate janata kii sahanubhuti mil gai
 But people believed that Anna's anger is emotional, they are not jealous of Kejriwal
 lekin phir vah din bhi aayaa jab anna mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ke pairokaar dikhaai die
 And when Mamta held a rally in Delhi, on her belief, Anna did not reach there upon receiving information about empty chairs
 mamata khun kaa ghunt pi kar rah gayi
 And people also kept wondering why Anna is being so double-faced
 iske baad anna camaron se ojhal se ho gaye
 Time kept growing
 unheen ke manch se utre general ve ke singh bhi bijepi main jaakar saansad or phir mantri ho gaye
 Now Kiran Bedi is the chief ministerial candidate
 arvind, ve ke singh or bedi kii raah logon ko samaj aa rahi he
 These people are going ahead for their intentions and reaching the Parliament which they did not listen to, they are saying their own
 anna ab bhi raajnneeti ko achhut banaae hue hai
 No one can see his activism even on Lokpal
 vaise yah baat bhi dhire-dhire jaahir ho gai thi ki anna kii team kii takat anna main nahin thi, balki team se anna kii takat thi
 Anna could never accept this matter from his heart
 unka bayaan mahatma gandhi ke bharat vibhaajan se thik pehle ke bayaan kii yaad dilaataa he jisamen baapu ne kaha tha- ‘main hindustan kii dhul se nayaa andolan khadaa kar duungaa
 This statement was made when Nehru, Patel, Jinnah were in no position to obey the supreme leader of the country
 ho saktaa he baapu jaisaa viraat vyaktitv yah kar bhi dikhaata, lekin umr ke 78wein saal main gandhiji ne apni team kii baat hi maan lee thi
 Anna is adamant on her stubbornness and the wheel of time has reached somewhere
 kabhi hajaare ke saath hajaaron kii bheed thi, aaj ve akele hai
 But its responsibility is ultimately the same wrong steps which Anna later pulled back
 shaayad sant tukaraam kii jameen ke sipaahi ko banaras ke sant kabir kii yah baat bisar gai - aadha chalakar peeche mudahai, huihai jag main haansi

 mumbai ke goregaanv ilaake main shivasainikon ko sambodhit karte hue, shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne elaan kar diya ki ab shivasena akele hi brihanmumbai mahanagar palika (biemasi) chunaav ladegi
 Shortly after this announcement, NCP Sharad Pawar in Pune reacted mischievously in this matter saying that i am very sad that so many years of working together have been separated
 sharad pavaar ne apni baat to kah di lekin apane chehre kii hansi chipa na sake, jisase ye saaf ho jaataa he ki sharad pavaar ko shivasena-bijepi ke alag hone se dukh kam kushi zyada hui he
 When asked by NCP chief Sharad Pawar if the Shiv Sena withdrew its support from the Maharashtra government, what would be the role of your party, Pawar laughed saying that if he does not answer the questions of the manger, if bjp-shiv Sena is any When deciding, it should be discussed
 sharad pavaar bhale hi unke samarthan dene yaa nahin dene kii baat spasht nahin kar rahe ho, lekin ye baat bhi kisi se chhipi nahin he ki sharad pavaar aurapradhanmantri narendra modiki dosti kitni gahari he
 Soon after the 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections, when there was tension between the Shiv sena-bjp over power sharing in the state government, the NCP had announced its support to the BJP to form the government in the state unconditionally
 is ghoshnaa ke baad shivasena kaa badhata kad kam hua tha
 After this, Shiv Sena mlas had to form an alliance with the BJP in the government without getting important portfolios
 ek baar phir bijepi-shivasena usee mode par man main kadavaahat liye khadey ho gaye hai
 In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Municipality (BMC) elections, the two parties had been in conflict for the last several days over the seat sharing

 The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday made it clear that the suspension will not be reconsidered until the Olympic Committee of India (IOA) conducts a fair and re-election
 iosi ne buudhvaar ko kendriya khel mantri jitendra singh ke netritv main lusaane pahunche bhartiya pratinidhimandal ke saath nilamban ke masale par charchaa kii
 The delegation also included members of national sports associations
 saath hi is bank main asian olympic samiti (osie) ke pratinidhiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The ioc's executive suspended the IOA on December 4 because it promoted government interference in the IOA elections in violation of the Olympic Charter
 iosi ne ehtiyaat ke taur par yah kadam uthaaya tha
 The IOC said in its statement, "the main objective of today's meeting is that we wanted to explore the possibility of conducting a fair and fresh election in the suspended IOA
 ham chaahate hai ki ioe phir se chunaav karaae jo puri tarah loktantric or paardarshee ho
 There should be no external interference
 iske baad hi iosi bhartiya olympic sangh ke khilaaf nilamban sambandhi apane faisle par punarvichaar karegaa
 The IOC said that it wanted the IOA to take necessary steps on its behalf in the event of suspension
 iosi ne kaha, ‘ioe ko apane sadasyon kii ek baithak bulani chahie, jisamen uske sanchaalan or naitik mulyon par charchaa ho
 This should be followed by a general meeting in which elections are held according to the terms of the new and redefined constitution under the Olympic Charter
 ’iosi ne kaha ki vah is puri prakriya par najar rakhega or ioe or uske sadasyon ke liye jaruri dishanirdesh jari karegaa
 The Sports Minister, who attended the meeting, said that the Government of India, taking the ioc's words seriously, will try to meet all the conditions while respecting the Olympic campaign

 This will be discussed most
 khel mahasanghon ke alaava is masale par aam jaanata kii bhi raay lee jaaegi
 We will take any beneficial step while respecting everyone's views

 agle vidhansabha chunaavon main osiyaan seat ke sambhavit daavedaaron ke bare main toh lene congress ke paryvekshak maanik jagataap pichley hafte ilaake main pahunche
 This seat has been considered as the traditional seat of the Maderna's veteran Maderna family
 lekin bhavari devi prakaran main mahipal maderna ke jail jane kii vajah se haashie par ja pahunche is parivaar ke jaale par or namak chhidakte hue uske pratidwandvi badriram jakhad ke parivaar ne daawa thok diya
 Pali MP Jakhar claimed the name of his daughter Munni Devi Godara, the former district head of Jodhpur
 maderna parivaar kaa to vaise koi vyakti nahin pahunchaa maukey par, lekin uske samarthakon ne jarur jagataap ke saamne parivaar ke paksh main aawaaj uthaai
 Mahipal's daughter Divya said this much on the development, "neither the elder (parasram) Maderna Saab claimed any claim, nor did the younger (mahipal) Maderna Saab
 party ne sachcha kaaryakarta maanakar hameshaa tikat diya
 Divya raised another question in the past
 sanghathan or kaaryakartaaon kii khayr-khabar lene bikaner aae congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se unhone poocha ki sibiai ke haath lagi 150 sidion main se keval unke pita kii sidi hi kyon jagajaahir kii gai? yah bhi sandesh de diya ki maderna kii potee ko bhi rahul gandhi se bheed main hi milanaa padataa he
 Has the name Maderna now become blurred in the eyes of the high command? Divya is wandering around in search of answers to many questions as to why her father was made a victim of political conspiracy? It is said that when in politics and who can retaliate, it cannot be said
 maderna parivaar aaj puri tarah se tutaa hua he
 However, Divya has been trying to somehow handle her family's fort by bouncing a lot of questions between the media and the public since her father Mahipal went to jail
 lekin yah sach he ki is parivaar ko ab siyasat main phir se uth khadey hone ke liye sirf maderna naam kaa sahaara naakaafi hoga
 There is a discussion in political circles that if Mahipal's wife Leela or daughter Divya decides to jump into the election summer, they will have to fight like other candidates
 yah kunba pradesh kii raajnneeti main saat dashak purana jarur he lekin chunavi dauron ke vakt in donon ko parivaar par lage dhabbon se baar-baar do chaar hona padegaa
 Time has scattered this clan, that is why, despite being an election year, the family is still sitting quietly
 yah parivaar 1952 se hi pradesh kii raajnneeti main kham thoktaa aayaa he
 Parasram Maderna's political life began under the guidance of Baldevaram Mirdha
 ve 1952 main pehali baar sarpanch bane
 Subsequently, he became an MLA and a minister from Osian in 1957
 assi ke dashak tak puure rutabe ke saath sarkaar main rahete aae senior maderna 1985 main pehali baar chunaav haare
 But after four years in 1989, again won from Bhopalgarh and became the President of the Pradesh Congress Committee
 1993 main jab pradesh main bhairon singh shekhavat kii sarkaar bani to ve vipaksh ke netaa banaae gaye
 In 1998, he got an opportunity to become the Speaker of the Assembly
 unke bete mahipal kaa siyaasi safar 1981 main shuru hua, jab ve jodhpur jila parishad ke pramukh bane
 He again achieved this position in 1988 and 1995
 2003 main jaakar ve vidhayak bane
 He became the Minister of Water in the current Ashok Gehlot Government
 2011 main bhawaridevi prakaran kaa khulaasa hone ke baad unase istipha le liya gaya
 a few days ago, while in jail, he acquired the post of vice chairman of the District Cooperative Bank
 unki patni lila lagaataar chaar baar jila parishad kii sadsy rah chuki hai or haal hi main dobaaraa sahakaari bank main nirvirodh adhyaksh chuni gayi
 At the same time, Divya Maderna's political life was to begin in the last assembly elections, but her age came in the way
 baad main divya ne pita ke vidhansabha kshetra osiyaan se jila parishad kaa chunaav ladakar shuruyaat kii
 However, the main opposition party of the state BJP and other fronts also want to associate the Maderna family with them and the Congress also knows this
 charchaa to jhunjhunuun ke saansad shishram ola ke bhi chhitakane kii thi lekin alaakaman ne unhen centre main mantri pad dekar unhen or gahalot se naaraaz jat tabake ko khush karne kii koshish kii he
 In such a situation, the Maderna family is also expected to get some relief from CBI and bail to Mahipal
 raahat na milane par is parivaar ke ain chunaav ke vakt koi bada faisla lene kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is said that if you try to achieve your goal with full vigor and hard work, then you can also change the lines of luck
