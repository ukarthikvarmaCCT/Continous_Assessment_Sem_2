 i am going to carry tons of sweet and sour memories
 It is an intimidating house with cameras at every corner
 
 
 not a single place where u could sit without being watched
 
 
 my favorite corner was the green BB door which had a cozy sitting too
 i loved the interiors of the house
 
 
 artistic to another level
 i woke up to miss all my inmates today
 
 
 missed making breakfast n lunch for all of them while abu Ji would sing to entertain us
 The journey was short but i feel i lived a lifetime there
 Waking up to high volume music will be missed too
 
 
 i want to thank the makers of Bigg boss @endemolshineind @viacom18 @colorstv to have given me this playform
 i truly believe, i would have contributed a lot if i had stayed further but i think i will leave it to the wisdom of the organisers
 Meeting @beingsalmankhan sir is embedded in my heart and i can’t thank him enough for holding my sons hand in humility n simplicity
 i learnt a lot sir and i wish to get an opportunity to meet u again
 Ur handsome face with the wit you carry is a combination to die for and i m nothing but fortunate to have met u!

 makapa ne kaha ki ek party (bhaajapa) sampradayikta kaa jehar failaa rahi he to duusari party (trinmul) ne pashchim bengal ko tabaahi ke raste par dhakel diya he
 Everyone wants to know the answer to a question for the last two years
 or wo ye ki haal ke vakt kaa sabase khoonkhaar antkavaadi bagdadi or uske sanghathan iesas kaa khatm kab hoga? to bas ye samaj lijie ki bagdadi ke khatme kii shuruuaat ho chuki he
 The last fortress in Iraq from which he started terror is just about to collapse
 bagdadi or aman ke bich ab bas ek hi aadchan he, or wo he, pachaas hajaar begunaah logon kii jindagi
 Faluja, one of the beautiful cities of Iraq, is currently crying the tears of terror
 ye shahar is vakt ek saath iesas, iraqi fouj or shiya milicia ke ladaakon ke bich aar-paar kii ladaai ke jakhm jhelane ko majaboor he
 This is the city which Baghdadi had completely occupied
 magar jaise hi shahar par se bagdadi kaa kabja kamjor hua shahar goliyon or bamon se tharra uthaa
 Baghdadi made people shield, in Faluja, there is a fight going on many fronts simultaneously
 ek taraf jahaan iesas he, vahiin duusari taraf america kii aguwai main nato or iraqi sena ke alaava sthaneey shiya milicia ke log hai
 Because of this joint operations, suddenly there has been a reversal in Faluja
 chautarafa hamalon se ghire iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke bhaagane ke raste tak band hote ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, as a last-ditch effort to save their lives, the terrorists have started fighting with the innocent townspeople of Faluja as their shield
 ISIS ne banaae 50 hajaar bandhakek andaaje ke mutabik iesas ne puure shahar main takreeban 50 hajaar logon ko bandhak bana liya he or unhen chetavanee di he ki agar wo maidan-e-jang se bhaagane kii koshish karte hai yaa safed jhanda dikhaa kar phogiyon ko daavat dete hai, to ve unhen sidhe goli maar denge
 While NATO and Iraqi forces are equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, tanks and rocket launches, local Shia militia fighters are taking on the terrorists from hand-made rockets and asylums raised on their own
 iraqi fouj kii ek or jeetfaluja iraq or bagdadi donon ke liye behad ahm he
 The Iraqi city of Tikrit and Ramadi has already left ISIS
 aise main baghdad se thodi hi dur par based faluja se pair ukhdane kaa matlab he iesas ko ek or karaari shikast
 While another big win for the Iraqi army
 bagdadi ne chali khaufnak chalaramaadi or tikrit to iesas ke haathon se pehle hi nikal chukaa he
 And now his feet are uprooted even in Faluja
 lekin is badi haar se bachane ke liye bagdadi ne ab jo chaal chali he, wo behad khaufnak he
 He has taken 50,000 city citizens hostage and stands in front of the army
 is dhamkee ke saath ki jo bhi bhaagane kii koshish karegaa use goli maar di jaaegi
 The NATO army claims that more than 70 ISIS militants have been killed in such airstrikes and ground-to-ground fighting
 jisamen faluja main iesas kaa sabase bada sargana rahaa maher al-bilavi bhi shaamil he
 The challenge before the army is that NATO army, Iraqi army and Shia militia have been trying to get Faluja out of the hands of terrorists for the last several months, but in true sense the siege of Faluja is now done
 shahar ke tamaam ahm raaston par ab fouj maujuud he or use aarpaar kii ladaai ke liye bas aakhri ishaare kaa intjaar he
 But the biggest challenge facing the army in this battle is the urban of Faluja
 rakka main bhi fanse 6 lakh logudhar, iraq ke faluja se dur syria ke raka shahar kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Common people are in the biggest trouble in this city occupied by ISIS
 vahaan se bhi logon ko shahar chhod kar bhaagane kii manaahi he
 But living can be known at any time
 aise main smagalleron kii chaandi ho gai he
 They are charging death money to expel every person from the city
 raka main ab bhi lagbhag chah lakh log fanse hai
 The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) wrote to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday to inquire about the proposed bilateral series in December this year
 donon deshon ke bich hue samjhaute ke anusaar pakistan isi varsh sanyukt arab emirate main sampurna shrinkhalaa ke liye bharat kii mejabani karne vaala he
 However, due to ongoing tension and political confrontation between the two countries, the crisis is clouded on this visit
 tippaniyan BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur had opposed the proposed bilateral series a few days earlier
 anuraag ne twit kar kaha tha ki pakistan jab tak bharat se bhaage mafia daaud ibrahim ko panaah detaa rahegaa or kashmir main algaavvaadiyon ko bhadakaata rahegaa cricket sambandh behaal nahin ho sakate
 Meanwhile, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that sports should be kept separate from politics
 unhone bisisiai se disambar main prastaavit dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa kaayam rakhane kii apil kii he
 Referring to Shaharyar's statement in the letter, the newspaper 'express Tribune' wrote, 'politics keeps going up and down and cricket should be kept out of it
 cricket do deshon ke bich shanti bahaali main ek ahm hathiyaar he
 He added, "BCCI Secretary Anurag should work on making this series possible in December
 ' haalanki isse pehle shehryaar khan bhi is dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa ke hone main andeh vyakt kar chuke hai
 Now the future of this series depends on the Ministry of Home Affairs of India
 donon deshon ke cricket bordon ke bich haalanki shrinkhalaa ke televijan prasaaran adhikaar ko lekar bhi matbhed he
 While PCB wants to give broadcasting rights to Ten Sports, the BCCI is opposing it

 But what has been revealed by the Pakistani terrorist Zia ur Rehman alias Waqas, who has been caught by the Delhi Police, is shocking
 vakaas ne bataaya he ki uske dimag main shuru se hi jehadi banane kaa fitur savaar tha
 According to Delhi Police inquiries, Waqas met lashkar-e-taiba recruiter Taj Mohammed several times before becoming a terrorist
 usne bataaya ki taj mohammad ne pehle pahal use baccha samaj kar waapas lautaa diya, lekin jab vakaas ne aatanki training lene kii jid pakad lee to ek din taj ne use training dene ke liye hami bhar di
 Not only this, Waqas then went to Taj Mohammad with 20-25 boys like him and his life changed from that day itself
 kya or kaise hoti thi trainingvkas ne police ko bataaya he ki naushera ilaake main 21 dinon tak daur-e-aam ke naam se unki pehali training chali
 For training, everyone had to get up at half past five in the morning and then continued training for the next 12 hours

 Abu Bakr, Abdulula and Azhar were our trainers and Abu Manzur used to take care
 ' vakaas ne aage bataaya ki training ke baad uski mulaakaat jaish-e-mohammad ke abdurrahman se hui
 Regarding the meeting between him and Abdurrahman, Waqas said, 'at his behest i reached the Phata area of waziristan
 vahaan hame margaj-e-aksa naam kii ek jagah par rakhaa gaya or phir 20-25 or ladakon ke saath meri duusari training shuru hui
 Nasir Bhai was in charge of the camp here
 lekin ye training bahut mushkil thi, jisaki vajah se kai ladakon ne bich main hi training chhod di
 According to the 10-day training and the blast, he was given training to use explosives for the first time during this training
 usne hidrogen paracsaide, potacium chloride or ammonium nitrate kaa istemaal karnaa siikhaa
 In this ten-day training, he was told how to connect the electronic circuit and carry out the blasts and thus was ready to become a terrorist to kill innocents and kill the slaughter-man
 hathiyaar chalaane se lekar bam chalaane tak kii training hasil karne ke baad vakaas khun-kharabe ke liye taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 He met Abdurrahman and Abdurrahman told him to stay there until the next order, telling him the address of a hotel in Karachi
 iske baad uski mulaakaat javed naam ke ek shaks se hui
 But this Javed was actually Riyaz Bhatkal, one of the founders of the Indian Mujahideen
 
 
 
 And the meetings started: Waqas met Silsilarias several times, and Riyaz advised him to go from Karachi to Kathmandu by handing him a Pakistani passport in September 2010
 saath hi yah bhi bataaya ki vahaan uski mulaaqaat tahseen urf monu naam ke ek shaks se hogi
 Tehseen Akhtar is the same person who later became the India Chief of IM
 vakaas kii maane to tab monu ne hi use nepal ke kathmandu airport par risive kiya or iske baad ve sarhad laangh kar nepal se hindustan main daakhil ho gaye
 According to Waqas, during his flight to Nepal, he met on a flight to Karachi from Asadullah Akhtar alias Bhadi and since then the two started living together
 monu un donon ko lekar sabase pehle darbhanga pahunchaa, jahaan uski mulaaqaat pehali baar yaccin bhatkal ke hui or bas iske baad shuru ho gai hindustan ko dhamaakon se dahalane kii ek nai or khaufnak sajeesh
 In the interrogation of two fingers, the police said that Waqas said that after coming to India, he did the first blast in Benares on December 7, 2010
 ye dhamaake hidrogen paracsaide se kiye gaye the
 Waqas said, 'then Yasin bhai, Monu bhai and Asadullah bhai, all of us worked together
 asadullah bhai kolkata se chemical lekar aae the or maine iidi banaai thi
 At the same time, while making an IED accidentally, there was a blast and my two fingers also got damaged
 'vakaas ne poochtacha main hindustan main apane pakade jane se pehle anjaam die gaye ek-ek dhamaakon kaa tafsil se byora diya he or bataaya he ki kis tarah mobile phonen se dur rah kar or naam or thikaane badal-badal kar yaccin kii aguwai main iem ke log hindustan ko lahooluhaan karte rahe or suraksha agenciyaan har dhamaake ke baad unka peechha karti raheen

 Google has recently launched its flagship smartphones Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL
 bharat main Pixel 2 kii bikri shuru ho chuki he
 The 64GB variant of Pixel 2 is priced at Rs 64,000, while you will have to pay Rs 70,000 to buy the 128GB variant
 Pixel 2 ke is rivyuu main aapako is smartphone se jude lagbhag sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab milenge
 Also you will be able to decide whether this smartphone is for you or not
 ham rivyuu ke dauraan smartphone kii real life testing karte hai or benchmark ke bare main baat nahin karte or na hi kisi ranking kii
 Here you will be able to know in easy terms, where does this smartphone stand for an Indian user
 dizin or bild qualitygugle ne ek kaam acha kiya he jisaki saraahna honi chahie
 The phone is of metal, but maybe you once understand that it is plastic
 lekin ek se do baar ke hold karne ke baad yakeenan aapako yah pasand aane lagegaa
 Because it is designed to be something like this
 hold karnaa kaaphi aasaan he, phone phisalata nahin he, phone halkaa he zyada vajani nahin he
 Not only this, scratches will not come easily on this
 kaaphi samay se kisi aisa hai and smartphone kaa intjaar tha jise bina cover ke yuj kiya ja sake
 Using the iphone 8 without cover may cost you dearly, but Pixel is rough and tough
 dizin krantikari nahin he or pichley saal ke Pixel smartphone se miltaa julata hi he
 But there are many major changes
 dual toned body kah sakate hai
 The rear panel has glass upwards
 hamane blike vairient kaa rivyuu kiya he or metal or glass kaa mishran kaaphi shandaar ha
 The fingerprint scanner is in the rear and is quite easy to unlock
 camera modul upar bain taraf he or flash iske bagal main he
 The camera is not bumpy, but there is a circle around the lens that turns outward
 ek taraf smartphone companiyaan 18:9 aspect reshyo vaala smartphone laa rahi hai yani bejal les smartphone kaa trend he, jabaki google ne Pixel 2 main bejal dene kaa faisla kiya he jo shaayad aapako niraash kar saktaa he
 Because from the front, it can look like a phone of 2 years old design
 haalanki bejal hone kaa ek bada phayda he jisaki vajah se shaayad aapako isamen bejal hone se bhi koi pareshaani na ho
 We will talk about it further
 displexoogle Pixel 2 main 5 inch kii screen he or bade bejals die gaye hai jise aap tasveeron main dekh sakate hai
 However, for those who are looking for a compact smartphone, there are many things in it and perhaps the company has made them by targeting
 phul echdi disple he, lekin chuki 5 inch kii screen he isliye rijolushan kamaal kaa he isamen koi samasya nahin he
 The company has used AMOLED panel instead of LCD which adds four moons to it
 baharhaal baat karte hai real life istemaal main isaki screen kya kamaal karti he
 Its screen is not as amazing as Pixel 2 XL, but still the viewing angles are correct, the colors are correct and the screen is bright
 disple iphone 8 se zyada brit he, lekin iphone 8 ke mukaable ise zyada behatar nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Yes, we can call the display of both smartphones the same except for a few things
 suraj kii raushnee main aap Pixel 2 par aasaani contents pard bhi sakate hai
 The special thing is that the colors look real, looks less artificial or decorative
 color balance kamaal kaa he or ek aam yujar ke liye rosemara ke istemaal main yah kaaphi myne rakhata he
 So it has been a good experience for us to see and use Google Pixel 2's display
 parformanceghoogle Pixel 2 ek hai and smartphone he or iske hardware bhi duusare hai and divaais jaise hi hai
 It has 4GB RAM with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor
 Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL donon hi smartphone main ek hi procesar or ram he
 But the performance of this small phone i
e
 Pixel 2 has been better
 smartphone lag nahin karata, hang hone kii koi samasya nahin he or jahaan tak baat gaming kii he to isamen yah kamaal karata he
 Especially in gaming, the big bezels given in it are quite useful, because you can play any heavy game comfortably by holding the phone on both sides
 aam taur par bejal les disple vaale smartphone main gaming karne main samasya ye hoti he ki aapkaa haath screen par chalaa jaataa he jo google Pixel 2 main bilkul bhi nahin he
 App loading is quite fast, switching from one app to another is quite smooth and it is easy to do many things at once
 google ne khaas kar is par kaaphi kaam kiya he jo is smartphone main dikhataa he
 Since the smartphone is not fast, it depends not only on the hardware, but it requires a great mix of hardware and software which Google has done well and the company should be praised for this
 software or artificial intelligensabazar main behtareen hardware vaale ek se bad kar ek smartfones maujuud hai jinamein hai and procesar se lekar 8GB ram he 128GB memory he
 But Pixel 2 is not a hardware centric smartphone
 company isamen android kaa sabase policd varjan daalaa he or ise shandaar tareeke se customij kiya he
 For example, it has a feature that will detect which song is playing on Always On Screen by detecting the song playing near you
 Pixel 2 main die gaye Android 8
 0 My experience with Oreo has been amazing
 yah smooth he, clin he or kaaphi tej bhi he
 Now Google search box is given below instead of above and along with some great wallpapers are given which are amazing and you will also like it
 Pixel 2 kaa launture ab tak kaa besch google android launture he
 Google Assistant now responds to your customers like you, not like a machine
 pehle se isaki aawaaj asli lagati he or khaas baat
 Compared to Siri, Bixby and Cortana, the Google Assistant surpasses these two in real life
 ye acystant aapako aapkaa berthde hi nahin bataata he, balki aapako berthde song ke saath vish bhi karata he or bilkul asli jaisaa
 There are many such tweaks that come in handy every day
 google acystant kii khaasiyat ye he ki jitna ise yuj karenge ye sateek hota jayega
 Google Assistant is better integrated into Pixel 2 than any other smartphone
 google acystant ke alaava isamen google lens bhi he jo kamaal kaa he
 However it is limited and remains to be worked on
 tasviir main kya contant he iske bare main google lens mashin larning ke jariye scan karke bataata he jo aapke kaam kaa sabit hoga
 It has rightly said about most things, but there have been mistakes
 google ke logo ko google lens kai baar detect nahin kar paata he
 Camera Google Pixel 2 is definitely a camera phone and in many cases surpasses the iphone 8, 8 Plus
 isamen 12
 a 2-megapixel rear camera has been provided with face detection autofocus, optical image stabilization, laser autofocal and dual LED flash
 iske alaava isamen diya gaya jeeyo tanging, phase ditection, echdiaar or tach focus shandaar kaam karte hai
 Its rear camera can record 4K video
 selfi ke liye isamen 8 megapixl kaa selfi camera diya gaya he
 Mid Shot and Close Now Pixel 2 beats all other smartphones for taking shots
 ek camera lens hone ke baavjood boke effect yani becoground bler kii hui tasviir dekhakar aapako dil khush ho jayega
 The background blur feature is quite great and the two cameras of the iphone 7 Plus will not have as good background blur as that of a Pixel 2 camera and it is amazing from Google's software
 Pixel 2 kaa camera lagbhag har tarah kii liting condishan ke liye behatar he
 There is a picture click with good and detail even in low light
 video recording ke dauraan agar aapkaa haath hill rahaa he phir bhi achche video capchar hote hai
 This smartphone is even better for selfie lovers
 front main ek hi camera he, lekin isamen bhi portate mod he yani yahaan bhi bekground bler karke selfi le sakate hai
 Selfie is very good click and images are very sharp here too and background is blur accurately
 portret mod par tasviren clic karenge to aapako to clic hone ke baad aapako do opshan milenge
 One can blur the background while the other photo will be normal
 isamen aipal kii tarah live photo kaa opshan bhi he, lekin mere hisaab se google ko isaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 Overall, based on our review experience, we can say that 8 out of 10 photos clicked in portrait mode will be great
 apane anubhav ke aadhaar par main yah kah saktaa hum ki kisi bhi smartphone main diya jane vaala best camera he
 The camera sample battery Pixel 2 does not support wireless charging, but it does have fast charging and it charges much faster than the given charger
 isamen 2,700mah kii bydaree di gai he
 One problem is that if you charge off and then you will not have any idea how much the phone has been charged
 bydaree ek din kaa byaap aaraam se detii he agar aap heavi yujar nahin hai
 If you are a heavy user, then you will need to charge in half a day like other flagship
 bydaree byaap or charging indicater ke maamle main Pixel 2 ne mujhe niraash kiya he
 Rating to date - 9 / 10 purvothar ke rajyon ke ek karod 65 lakh pre-ped mobile dharakon main se kareeb 80 fisadi kaa conection kabhi bhi cat saktaa he

 shaadi ke baad sabakuch badal jaataa he
 Especially for Indian women
 agar aapaki shaadi arenjd hui he to ho saktaa he ki aapako kuch zyada hi afsos ho
 This does not mean that there are no regrets in the love marriage, but there is also a malaise in the minds of women about something or the other
 shaadi ke baad kuch baton ko lekar afsos hona ek aam baat helekin aap ise kis tarah se sambhalati hai, ye zyada jaruri he
 Most women accept the new environment
 iske peeche unki yahi soch hoti he ki is nae maahaul ko sweekaar karne ke alaava unke paas doosraa koi rasta bhi nahin he
 But somewhere with time, he starts to think that he got very wrong by getting married
 aamtaur par shaadi ke baad mahilaon ko ye paanch tarah ke malaal rahete hai:1
 There is no time for himself, this malaal begins to happen after one month of marriage
 jab ladki ko puraa parivaar sanbhaalanaa padataa he
 Once the children are born, the situation becomes worse
 ek vakt par mahila ko lagane lagata he ki wo keval dusron ke hi kaam karti rah jaati he, uske paas khud ke liye to vakt hi nahin he
 2
 khud ke liye speskisi bhi shaks ke jivan main spes kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 After marriage, the girl rarely gets any time when she can only spend a few moments with her
 ye ek bahut bada dukh hota he kyonki personal spes har insaan kii jarurat hoti he
 3
 bachche ko lekar jaldibhale hi ladki abhi maa nahin bananaa chaahati he par ghar-parivaar waalon ke dabaav main use aisa karnaa hi padataa he
 After the child is born, it becomes completely his responsibility and he has to give up all his time on it
 sona, khaanaa, pahananaa sabakuch us bachche ke anusaar karnaa padataa he
 This is one of the five major regrets women feel after marriage
 4
 Changing oneself for a husband, although both the boy and the girl are tied in the marriage, but it is expected from the girl that they change according to the boy
 uski aadaton ke anusaar apni puraani aadaton ko edjast kare
 Initially she also does this, but after a time, she seems to have lost her personality
 yaheen se uskaa afsos shuru ho jaataa he
 5
 purv premi se tulanashaadi ke pehle agar ladki kisi relationships main rah chuki he to wo hameshaa apane pati or purv premi ke bich tulana karti rahati he
 In many cases, when she finds her ex-boyfriend better, she thinks that she should have married him

 This is what makes a person climb the ladder of success
 aapke bheetar kaa aatmavishvaas aapako logon ke saamne coffident banaae rakhane main aapaki madad karata he
 If you do not believe in yourself, other people will also look at you with suspicion
 aise main aaie jaanate hai koun se hai wo 5 tareeke jinaki madad se aap apane bheetar khoyaa hua aatmavishvaas dobaaraa jagaa sakate hai-1
 Avoid Negative Thinking - Negative thoughts always prevent you from moving forward
 aise main khud par vishwaas rakhane se aap chunauteepurn kaam bhi aasaani se kar sakate hai
 If there is more work in the office, do not steal from work, nor do you ever think that due to pressure of work, you will not be able to do this difficult work
 apni negative soch ko sakaaratmak soch main tabdeel karen
 2
 apane liye vakt nikaalen- jivan main jab kabhi niraash ho jaaen to khud ke liye thodaa samay nikaalkar ye jarur sochen ki aap jivan main aakhir paanaa kya chaahate hai? bhavishya ke liye aapaki kya planning hai? bhavishya main agar aapako nae maukey milte hai to kya aap uske liye taiyaar hai
 Remember, you cannot instill confidence in yourself until you identify yourself well
 aapaki khud se pahchaan aapke aatmavishvaas ko badhaane main aapaki madad karti he
 When you make time for yourself, you will know how little you know about yourself
 3
 Understand things - People get very little time to understand their thinking in a run-of-the-mill life
 jivan main sahi faisle lene ke liye har cheez ko acchhee tarah samajhane kii koshish karen
 By doing this, you will be able to easily find the difference between right and wrong in life, which will boost your inner confidence
 4
 Accept challenges - Everyone wants to live in their comfort zone
 aise main agar use koi nayaa kaam saunp diya jaae to wo ghabara jaataa he or use taalata rahata he
 Always accept challenges to move forward in life
 aap jaise hi nai chizon ko karne kii shuruyaat karenge, aapke bheetar kaa chipa aatmavishvaas aapako hi nahin balki logon ko bhi dikhne lagegaa
 5
 coffident logon se dosti karen-achche dost kii sangat kaa jivan par bahut gaharaa asar padataa he
 If you have a friend who keeps making excuses for doing any work or is lacking in confidence, then it is better to stay away from such friends

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party's Haryana government for the lack of water in the state
 kejariwal ne apane twit main likhaa ki bijepi dillivaasiyon ke saath gandi raajnneeti kar rahi he
 On this issue, Delhi BJP President Sakshamnoj Tiwarien said, 'kejriwal talked about giving free water, but now he has become watery
 ' tiwari ne kaha, 'haryana sarkaar pehle ke mukaable 8 fisadi zyada pani de rahi he, dilli kii janata pani ke galen or baaltee haath main lekar kejariwal ko dhundh rahi he
 'manoj Tiwari said,' a few days ago Kejriwal went to meet Haryana Chief Minister Khattar
 khatter se milane ke baad kejariwal bahut gadgad bhav se aae the, tab koi aisi baat nahin bataai
 Today suddenly Kejriwal is not able to manage water, then Haryana is blaming all the blame
 aisi gandi raajnneeti karne main kejariwal maahir hai
 'tiwari said,' Kejriwal is adept at serving such a lie and i think now the people of Delhi have become very intelligent, by doing all this, Kejriwal has brought 67 seats out of 70
 'dilli bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, 'meri mukhyamantri khatter se baat hui he
 Khattar is giving 8% more water to Delhi than before
 haryana dwaara die jane vaale pani ko ghar-ghar kaise pahunchaaya jaae yah vyavastha karne main hi arvind kejariwal naakaam hai

 ' Prime Minister Modi's Swachh Bharat Mission and Open Defecation Free Campaigns have grown in Rajasthan
 yah hakeekat india today ke ground report main saamne ai he ki rajasthan ke kai gaanvon main logon ne sarkaar se inaam bhi le liya or shouch ke liye kheton main janaa bhi nahin choda
 Investigation revealed that if the toilets were half-finished, they were not made at all
 
 
 or bina kisi vairiffication ke sarkari dhan baant diya gaya
 We will tell you in a three-part series by opening the black-sheet of this entire corruption
 aaj pesh he pehali kisht
 
 
 In the Badi Gram Panchayat of Dholpur district of Rajasthan, many men and women were seen going to the India Today correspondent to defecate under the open sky
 thik aisi hi kahani bharatpur jile ke raarah gram panchayat kii bhi saamne ai
 The day of the people of the village of Rarah begins today as usual, with a bottle of water in hand and going towards the fields
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki bharatpur jile main raarah ko hi sarkaar ne khule main shouch mukt pehla gaanv ghoshit kiya tha
 The villagers of Dholpur and Bharatpur answer the questions asked about open defecation campaign and Swachh Bharat Mission very well
 asal main unhen in donon hi yojanaon ke uddeshyon kii malumat to he hi saath hi saath in logon ne rajasthan sarkaar kii taraf se diya jane vaala 'inaam' bhi le rakhaa he
 Let us tell you that the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan is giving prize money of Rs
 12,000 on the construction of every toilet to promote Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of making India open defecation free
 rajasthan main is skim ke tahat ab tak 55 lakh graminon ko yah inaam mil chukaa he
 That is, 6,600 crore rupees have been distributed so far to the people for their contribution in making toilets in their homes and making the country toilet free
 dhaulpur or bharatpur donon jilon main is inaam ke liye 330 karod rupayon kaa bhugtan ho chukaa he
 Whereas in these two districts, rural people are going to defecate in the open even today
 gaanvon main kuch toilet aadhe-adhure bane hue hai to kuch ko storeroom bana diya gaya he
 India Today correspondent went to the villages of Bharatpur and Dholpur to investigate the matter
 ground report main prashasnic laaparvaahee kii sachai khulkar saamne ai ki kaise bina jaanch-padtaal or vairiffication ke cash riward baant diya gaya taaki mahatvakankshi yojana svachh bharat mishan ke antargat khule main shouch mukt abhiyaan ko kaagaj par safal bataaya ja sake
 In Walled Toilet Dhaulpur village, two daughters of Puran Devi go to open defecation while the names of two members of her house are listed in the list of beneficiaries under the award in open defecation free campaign
 vajah poochne par pataa chalaa ki puuran devi ke ghar main bane shauchalayon main septic tanks hi nahin he
 Apart from this, there is no wall in one toilet
 phir bhi dusron kii tarah hi puuran devi ke parivaar ko do band shauchalayon ke liye kul 24 hajaar rupye mil chuke hai
 Talking to India Today, Puran Devi admitted that she had received 24 thousand rupees in the bank account but also said that her daughters-in-law still go to the fields for defecation in the dark
 unki do bahuen, phulvati or saroj shuruyaat main gharon main hi andar chhipi raheen lekin jab unki saas kahin chali gayi to baahar aa gayi
 Saroj said, "the wall has fallen
 ham shouch ke liye kheton main hi jate hai
 "one toilet, four members of Umashankar's family from Inamdhaulpur are the beneficiaries of the reward received from the Rajasthan government
 khud umashankar, unke do bhai or unke pita chaaron ko milakar 48 hajaar unhen chaar shauchalayon ke nirmaan ke liye mil chuke hai
 When India Today correspondent visited his house, he found that only one toilet is being used
 ek shauchalay kaa istemaal storeroom ke taur par ho rahaa tha or usamen gehun bharaa hua tha jabaki doosraa isliye istemaal main nahin tha kyonki usamen toilet seat hi nadaarad thi
 However, Umashankar defended himself against allegations that his family should get more money than he should have
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko ek shauchalay main gehun bhandaaran karnaa shuru karnaa padaa kyonki gaanv ke bahut se log shauchalay kaa istemaal karne ke liye unke ghar aane lage the
 India Today visited Kanchanpur and Pubesura Gram Panchayats of Dholpur and came across many toilets which either did not have a septic tank or were missing seats
 kuch udhaaharan aise bhi saamne aae jinamein shauchalayon main pani kii supplai kii kami thi
 Where did the money go? The case of Ram Vilas of Dholpur village looked a bit different
 ramvilas ke mutabik unke parivaar ke do sadasyon kaa naam labhaarthiyon kii suchi main tha
 According to which, on paper, his family was to get 24 thousand rupees for the construction of two toilets but he got only 12 thousand rupees
 ram vilaas ne kaha, "donon shauchalayon ke liye paisa paper par de diya gaya he lekin mujhe paisa sirf ek ke liye hi mila
 Don't know what happened 
 
 "farji pataa, farji photokuch maamalon main aisi gadabadiyaan bhi saamne ain, jahaan bina shauchalay banawaye hi graminon ko 12,000 rupee kaa inaam de diya gaya
 One such villager is Siya
 india se baatcheet main shuruaati hichkichaahat ke baad usne kabool kiya ki use bhi ek aise hi shauchalay ke liye 12,000 rupee mili, jo ki asal main uske bahanoi ke ghar bane the
 Sia said that she gave the wrong address in her application, but her papers were passed
 siya bataati he, 'jija ji ke ghar main shauchalay bana
 
 
 i did not build my house
 lekin mujhe puure 12,000 rupee mil gaye
 Meera, who hails from the same village, says that she collected a picture of a fake toilet and took the reward under the Swachh Bharat Mission
 vah bataati hai, 'ek baar jab paise mil gaye, maine toilet seat hataa diya or vahaan rasoi bana di
 Meera's family again started going out in the open for defecation

 Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal are constantly trying to spread his party to different states of the country, away from political noise
 dakshin bharat main camel hasan or vishaal ko nyotaa dene ke baad ab arvind kejariwal jharkhand main pair pasaarne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party succeeded in making a place for itself in the state by taking the first step in the Uttar Pradesh civic elections
 aam aadmi party ab jharkhand main apane liye raajnneetik jameen taiyaar kar rahi he
 Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh Sanjay Singh and Jharkhand in-charge Sanjeev Jha have met former Jharkhand Chief Minister and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha president Babulal Marandi in Ranchi
 isse pehle khud babulal marandi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se dilli main unke awaas par mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 After the meeting of Kejriwal and Marandi, the party leaders reached Ranchi and met the President of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha again
 aap sutron kaa kahana he ki jharkhand main donon partiyon ke bich sahmati ban gai he jiske tahat jald hi jharkhand main aam aadmi party or jharkhand vikaas morcha ke gathbandhan par muhar lag sakati he
 If reliable sources are to be believed, then in January next year, the head of the party Arvind Kejriwal can also hold public meetings with Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand
 janvari main hi jharkhand main kisi jansabha ke dauraan aam aadmi party or jharkhand vikaas morcha ke aupchaarik gathbandhan kaa elaan bhi ho saktaa he
 Trouble with Soren's image? AAP sources say that the Aam Aadmi Party does not have a strong organization in Jharkhand, whereas Jharkhand Vikas Morcha and Babulal Marandi have their own strong organization
 haalanki aam aadmi party ke paas jharkhand mukti morcha ke adhyaksh shibu sorain ke saath gathbandhan ke raste bhi khule the lekin dilli ke netritv ko lagata he ki shibu sorain kii chhavi behatar nahin he or unke mukaable babulal marandi ko lekar ke dilli or jharkhand donon jagahon par unki chhavi par koi daag nahin he
 AAP leaders believe that by aligning with Babulal Marandi, not only will the Aam Aadmi Party get recognition in Jharkhand but they will also get a strong leader
 haalanki gathbandhan ke aupchaarik elaan se pehle aam aadmi party gathbandhan par vistaarpurvak manthan karnaa chaahati he
 In Jharkhand, the Aam Aadmi Party does not have any face present, in such an alliance the Babulal Marandi and putting them forward will not mind the party
 dilli ke vidhayak or jharkhand ke prabharee sanjeev jha pichley 2 saal se lagaataar jharkhand main sanghathan ke liye kaam kar rahe hai or choti moti sabhaayen bhi kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, if the Aam Aadmi Party's alliance with the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha is there, it will be a big win for Kejriwal as well as help his Aam Aadmi Party to flourish in other states outside Delhi
 kejariwal philhal chunavi shor or media se dur rahakar jahaan dilli main apni sarkaar par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai vahi party ke duusare netaa alag-alag rajyon main sanghathan ko majboot karne kii koshishon main lage hue hai

 Anurag Kashyap does not embody the intelligence of the audience in this film
 is krim thriller main anuraag ne wo saare elements daale hai jo kisi bhi aam bollywood film ko masaaledaar banaate hai
 They have been used in such a way that throughout the film, they keep the flavor and the film does not look tasteless anywhere
 gang wars par vaise to kai filmein banati rahati hai or anuraag kii is film kii kahani bhi koi bahut hatakar nahin he, hatakar he to iskaa treetment or shandaar acting
 The response received on the first day of the film makes it clear that Gangs of Wasseypur is not just one of the films seen and appreciated in the film festivals, it is a film between the seats and applause by sitting in the cenam houses

 In August this year, Down to Earth had published a report on Ganga in which it clearly stated that there is a goal of cleaning the Ganga by March 2019, but there has not been a meeting of the National Ganga Council headed by the Prime Minister regarding Ganga
 oktober 2016 main yah council bani thi or down tu arth kii report 29 agast 2018 kii he
 There is not a single meeting in two years
 avikal somvanshi kii report he ki ganga nadi main pradooshan ko rokane or bachaane ke liye neshnal ganga council kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Its gazette is that there will be a meeting in a year
 2009 main neshnal ganga river basin athurity (NGRBA) bani thi jise bhang kar diya gaya or 7 oktober 2016 ko neshnal ganga council banaaya gaya
 The authority formed at the time of Manmohan Singh had five seats

 Down to Earth is reported
 yah bhi 2014 or 2015 main uma bharti kii adhyakshata main NGRBA kii baithak hui thi
 In July 2016, a meeting of the NGRBA was held under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Modi, but a new council was formed, after which it was not held for two years

 GD Agarwal's family has been a supporter of the Sangh for three generations
 paryaavarnavid ravi chopra kaa kahana he ki khud ji di agarwal ke sangh ke netaaon se kareebi rishte the
 On August 12, Matrasdan also wrote a letter to Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat

 Most of Agarwal's demands were accepted but Prof

 aapako pataa chalegaa ki ganga ko lekar slogan likhane, naare lagane or zamin par jo ho rahaa he usamen kaaphi fark he
 Meanwhile, Sant Gopaldas of Haryana is also on hunger strike over Ganga

 The administration sent him to Joshimath and then to Jasmine

 Even after this, Saint Gopaldas is sitting on a hunger strike for the Ganges at Triveni Ghat
 pradhanmantri ne ganga ko bhi maa kaha, yamuna ko bhi maa kaha
 Can Prime Minister Modi go to the same Mathura and say that he cleaned the water of Yamuna Maa
 dilli vaale khud bhi jaakar dekh sakate hai ki yamuna ko lekar kya hua he
 Initially there were a lot of activities related to Ganga
 ganga kinare aarti hoti thi
 Ghats built in Benaras
 magar vahaan se bhi sawaal uthne laga ki ganga kahaan saaf hui he
 Initially such programs were providing grandeur on the TV screen, but gradually the brightness faded or the Prime Minister himself got ahead of the issue
 pataa nahin
 But those who were worried about Ganga then started questioning the Prime Minister where is Ganga
 aakhir ek paryaavarnavid ko pradhanmantri modi se ummid kyon nahin hoti
 Even after coming into government, the Prime Minister did not leave Ganga
 aaj kal unke bhaashanon main ganga sunai nahin detii he
 But on 30 September 2014, he gave a speech from the forum of the Council of Foreign Relations, and said that he wanted to launch a public movement
 ganga ke liye duniya ke paryaavarnavidon kaa aahwan karte hai
 You should also ask the Prime Minister where is the mass movement about Ganga
 unke rahete ek paryaavarnavid kii maut kaise ho gai
 In May 2015, the Prime Minister announced the Namami Gange project
 ganga mantralay banaaya
 Made a budget of 20,000 crores for 6 years
 pro
 Aggarwal had reservations about the project created by Prime Minister Modi
 unhen lagata tha ki ye sab korporate ke liye he
 In the letter written to the Prime Minister on 24 February, the way it is written, Prof
 ji di agarwal jaisaa hi shaks likh saktaa he
 He writes, 'till 2014 Lok Sabha elections, you yourself also talked about being the sensible, loving and devoted son of mother Gangaji but by winning the election by the blessings of mother and by the grace of Lord Ram, now you Some of them are trapped in a group of greedy, luxury-loving sons and daughters and to raise the means of luxury of the drains that you guys call Vikas, sometimes carrying the burden of an old mother in the name of Jal Marg Want mule insert made, but the energy required to solve the whole, Bull machines such as car or crusher
 ' The Ganges will know how clean Ganga is
 varna mantri rose twitor par apadet karte ki aaj ganga ke liye kahaan kya hua
 For many days, even in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the work done till now about Ganga is not heard
 madhya pradesh kii raily main sunai de to phir narmada ko lekar vahaan ke log utsahit ho sakate hai
 The CAG gave a report on Namami Gange in December 2017, stating, 'we had examined the sample of 87 projects
 inamen se 50 1 april 2014 ke baad laanch hue the
 7,992 for all these
 34 karod rupee kii manzuri di gai thi
 2,615 crore fund was not utilized during 2014-15 to 2016-17
 kisi project main 8 pratishat hi fund istamaal hua to kisi main adhik se adhik 63 pratishat
 ' jo badi tippanee thi wo yah ki neshnal mishan for clin ganga ne iaiti se qaraar kiya tha magar iske 6 saal baad bhi koi doorgaami yojana banane main naakaam rahaa
 This is what the CAG has said
 ganga main girane vaale gande pani ko saaf karne ke liye sivej treetment plant lagane kaa kaam bhi dhimi gati se chal rahaa he
 Funds of more than two thousand crores have not been used
 yah disambar 2017 kii report he
 In August this year, Down to Earth had published a report on Ganga in which it clearly stated that there is a goal of cleaning the Ganga by March 2019, but there has not been a meeting of the National Ganga Council headed by the Prime Minister regarding Ganga
 oktober 2016 main yah council bani thi or down tu arth kii report 29 agast 2018 kii he
 There is not a single meeting in two years
 avikal somvanshi kii report he ki ganga nadi main pradooshan ko rokane or bachaane ke liye neshnal ganga council kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Its gazette is that there will be a meeting in a year
 2009 main neshnal ganga river basin athurity (NGRBA) bani thi jise bhang kar diya gaya or 7 oktober 2016 ko neshnal ganga council banaaya gaya
 The authority formed at the time of Manmohan Singh had five seats
 pradhanmantri modi ne nai council to bana di magar do saal main ek bhi baithak nahin hui
 Down to Earth is reported
 yah bhi 2014 or 2015 main uma bharti kii adhyakshata main NGRBA kii baithak hui thi
 In July 2016, a meeting of the NGRBA was held under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Modi, but a new council was formed, after which it was not held for two years
 avikal somvanshi ne likhaa he ki neshnal mishan for clin ganga ke mahanideshak ko kai phone kiye magar koi jawaab nahin mila
 The comments aap dekhenge ki aapke hindi akhabaaron main ganga ko lekar bhavukta kii bate hongi ki ganga ye hai, wo hai magar ganga se judi khabaren is tarah se vistaar se shaayad hi aapako milen jis tarah se down tu arth ne kii thi
 So change the way you watch Hindi newspapers and Hindi channels

 Nitin Gadkari has tweeted that Prof
 agarwal kii zyaadaatar maange maan lee gayi thim magar pro
 GD Agarwal and social activists involved in saving the rivers are not agreed
 aap ganga ko lekar sarkaar ke kisi mantri kaa bayaan suniye or hemanth dhyani ko suniye khud fark kiijie ki koun kya daawa kar rahaa he or koun kya sawaal kar rahaa he
 You will know that there is a big difference between writing slogans, shouting slogans and what is happening on the ground

 He too started a fast in Badinath from 24 June
 prashasan ne unhen joshimath or phir vahaan se chameli bhej diya
 Finally AIIMS was admitted to Rishikesh and fed
 iske baad bhi triveni ghat par sant gopaldaas ganga ke liye anshan par baithe hai

 However, during the debate on the President's address in the first session after the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha, many big leaders from both the power and opposition did not speak and the country was deprived of knowing the initial thoughts of these leaders after the new government came into existence
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke bhaashan par loksabhaa main bahes par charchaa ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mangalvaar ko jawaab diya, haalanki sansad ke is nichali sadan main unheen kii party ke kai bade netaaon samet pehali baar chunakar sansad pahunche anya kshetron ke diggajon ne apane vichaar rakhane se parhez kiya, sirf satta paksh hi nahin balki vipaksh kii ore se kai diggaj sirf sadan main shrota ke rup main baithe rahe
 Who made the distance from speaking Amit Shah: As the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Amit Shah was the number one leader who reached the Lok Sabha for the first time
 joardaar bhaashan dene vaale amit shah se ummid thi ki wo bataur loksabhaa saansad is bahes main shaamil honge or kendriya grih mantri ke rup main apane vichaar rakhenge jise janata sunegi
 However, he did not attend it
 rahul gandhimethi main loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baavjood vynad se jitkar loksabhaa pahunche congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne raashtrapati kovind ke bhaashan par chali bahes main shaamil hone se duuri banaae rakhi
 He must be present in the House during Prime Minister Modi's speech, but he did not say anything
 akhilesh yadavakareeb dhai saal pehle mulaayam singh yadav ko hataakar samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh pad par kabiz hone vaale akhilesh yadav chauthi baar loksabhaa pahunche the
 Akhilesh, who represented Kannauj for the last 3 times, decided to contest from Azamgarh this time due to political equations and once again reached the Lok Sabha with a big victory
 pichhali 3 baar kii jagah is baar vah bataur samaajawaadee party adhyaksh ke rup main saansad bane the
 He was expected to represent the important state like Uttar Pradesh before the government, but he was not present in the house
 unke bare main yah bhi spasht nahin he ki sadan kii kaarywahi chalane ke dauraan vah desh main hai bhi yaa nahin
 Sunny Deol: The actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol reached the Lok Sabha for the first time and it was believed that he would join the debate on President Kovind's address and put forward his speech
 lekin unhone bhi isse kinaaraa kiya or bahes main shaamil nahin hue
 Gautam Gambhir (file photo-k Asif) Gautam Gambhir: Now let's talk about cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir
 loksabhaa chunaav ladane se thik pehle vah bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil hue or east dilli sansadeey kshetra se saansad bane
 Gambhir, who is seen as being very outspoken on the cricket field, was believed that after winning his first victory in the field of politics, he would share his views while attending President Kovind's speech and the whole House would see his attitude, but not Happened
 varun gandhirahul gandhi ke chachere bhai or pilibhit se saansad bane varun gandhi ne bhi raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan main hissaa nahin liya
 Varun Gandhi, who reached the Lok Sabha for the third time, does not appear to be very active in the House and this time too he started off
 17veen loksabhaa kii pehali bahes main unhone hissaa nahin liya
 He first became an MP from Pilibhit in 2009 and subsequently in 2014 was elected as an MP from Sultanpur
 smriti irani (file photo- shailesh rawal)smriti iranimbhartiya janata party (bijepi) main ubharate netaaon main smriti irani kaa naam aata he or is baar kaa chunaav unke liye us samay yaadgaar sabit ho gaya jab unhone amethi se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko apratyaashit tareeke se haraakar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 With this victory, she managed to reach the Lok Sabha for the first time
 narendra modi sarkaar main duusare kaarykaal main bhi unhen kendriya mantri banaaya gaya or mana ja rahaa tha ki raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan main hissaa lete hue apni aage kii yojana ke bare main raay rakhengi lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 These leaders were absent from the first major debate of the 17th Lok Sabha, but it is expected that in the coming times, they will give their views on the burning issues of the country and the biggest temple of democracy will benefit from their presence

 ) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley can give good news to people 2 weeks before the country's general budget is presented
 dilli main aaj jiesti council kii 25 veen baithak hone ja rahi he jisamen, 70 se zyada chizon par jiesti kii daren kam kii ja sakati he
 These may include lower rates of household items, agricultural goods, irrigation related items and machines, handloom items and cement and steel items

 Another important issue can be discussed in the GST meeting
 real estate ko jiesti main shaamil karne kaa faisla
 It is believed that the GST Council can make a decision in this meeting and announce the date for implementing it
 ho saktaa he iske liye 1 april kii taarikh tay kii jaae
 It is being said that after coming under the purview of GST, stamp duty and registration charges in real estate will also be included in this
 anumaan he ki sarkaar real state par 12 fisadi jiesti laga sakati he
 Merchants will also get relief Regarding GST, there has been a complaint from traders and shopkeepers from the beginning that they have to fill many forms for GST
 sambhaavna he ki jiesti council jiesti ke 3 form ko ek main hi shaamil kar legi jisase yah prakriya aasaan ho sake
 The government had received so many complaints about the problems of filling the form that repeatedly the government had to extend the date of filing GST returns

 In the month of November, only 80, 808 crores came from GST whereas in July, when GST came into force, 94 thousand crores came from GST
 aisa isliye hua kyonki sarkaar lagaataar kai chizon par jiesti kii dar kam kar chuki he
 Due to the change in tax in the general budget after the implementation of GST, the system of getting things cheaper and expensive is over because now the GST Council only decides what will be taxed on what
 aam bajet main ab sirf sarkaar ke aamadani or kharch kaa lekha-jokha or saath hi diarect tex hi bachaa he, jis par logon kii nigahen hongi
 It will be the last full budget of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 In today's meeting, GST can be reduced on electric buses and electric cars also

 Pakistan could score only 158 runs while playing 20 overs
 pakistan kii taraf sharjil khan ne sabase zyada 47 ran banaae
 But if you look at the points table, then still Pakistan team is in second place due to excellent runrate with double digits

 If the Pakistan team wins this match with a brilliant runrate then Pakistan can reach the semi-finals
 chaliye jaanate hai kaise
 The comments - pakistan ko apane aakhri match main australia ko buree tarah haraana padegaa
 Then Pakistan will get 4 points with a good run rate

 Today, the first Arghya is being given to the Sun in the four-day Mahaparva Chhath
 aaj duubate surya ko arghya dene ke liye deshbhar ke ghaaton par chhath vratiyon kii bheed umad padi he
 From Patna to Mumbai, devotees are engaged in ritualistic worship
 kal chauthe din ugte surya ko arghya dene ke baad vrati upwas kholenge or prasad grahan karenge
 Chhath is the only such festival in the whole world in which the sun rising and the sun setting is also worshiped, water is offered
 prakruti kii vandana kaa parv chhath yun to bharat ke purvanchal ilaake main hi manaaya jaataa tha lekin global hoti duniya or samskritiyon ke sangam ke daur main chhath ab mahaparv ban chukaa he
 Offer to the Sun according to the zodiac on Chhath, it will be fulfilled from every wish, to Delhi and Mumbai, there is a rush of devotees at the river ghats
 chaar dinon ke is mahaparv main chhath vrati 36 ghante kaa kathin upwas karte hai
 During the festival, purity of mind and body is very important
 manyata he ki chhathi maia kii bacchon par vishesh krupa hoti he
 
 
 Therefore, in order to get the blessings of the child's safety, this fast is also very important
 kya he arghya kaa shubh muhuurtaaj duubate surya ko shaam 5 bajkar 36 minute tak arghya diya ja sakegaa
 And tomorrow i
e
 on Friday, it is time to offer sun to the Sun from 6
24 am
 kal subah ke arghya ke baad vrati upwas kholenge or chhath kaa prasad grahan karenge
 Why is the tradition of offering arghya to the setting sun? There are many fasts and festivals in the tradition of offering arghya to the rising sun, but the tradition of offering arghya to the setting sun is usually only in Chhath Vrat
 karthik maas shukla paksh kii shashthee ko dhalate surya ko arghya kyon diya jaataa he
 Three times in the morning, afternoon and evening Surya Dev are particularly effective
 subah ke vakt surya kii aradhana se sehat behatar hoti he
 Worshiping the sun in the afternoon increases the name and fame
 shaam ke samay surya kii aradhana se jivan main sampannataa aati he
 In the evening, Surya lives with his second wife Pratyusha
 isliye pratyusha ko arghya dena turant laabh detaa he
 Those who worship the setting sun must also worship the rising sun
 jyotish ke jaankaron kii maane to ast hote surya ko arghya dene kii parampara insaani jindagi har tarah kii pareshaani dur karne kii shakti rakhti he
 Then the problem is related to health or personal life
 dhalate surya ko arghya dekar kai museebaton se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 These people must offer arghya to the setting sun - those who are caught in the trial without any reason
 jin logon kaa koi kaam sarkari vibhaag main atka ho
 People whose eyesight is decreasing
 jin logon ko pet kii samasya lagaataar bani rahati ho
 Students who are repeatedly failing the exam

 sutron ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya

 On this, some Pakistanis showed tact and told them that you are on the Indian side
 magar abhinandan ko kuch shaq hua
 After this he shouted slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai
 iske baad phir pakistaniyon ne unhen gher liya
 Abhinandan somehow ran away to save himself
 baad main unhen pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main le liya
 The army questioned him, but Abhinandan opened his mouth as much as he was allowed to tell in the Air Force
 iske baad unhen pakistani sena ne chaay-coffee bhi pilaai

 pakistan ek parmaanu sampann desh hone kaa daawa karata he lekin aatankwaad kaa panaahagaah or sangrakshak pakistan ke paas dam banane ke liye paise nahin hai
 Many areas of Pakistan are struggling with the water problem and for this many dams are needed
 lekin baat-baat par hindustan ko parmaanu bam kii dhamkee dene vaale pakistan ke paas dam ke liye paise nahin hai, isliye in dinon pakistan main logon se chanda ikattha kiya ja rahaa he
 Recently, Pakistan has been placed third in the countries of the world facing severe water crisis
 iske baad pakistan ke mukhya nyaayadhish saaqib nisaar ne sarkaar kii aakshamata, ayogyata or aniksha ko dekhte hue pakistan main do dam (daimaar-bhashaa, 4500 megawatt or mohamand, 700 megawatt) banane ke liye logon se chanda dene kii apil kii
 He also appealed to Pakistani citizens living abroad to donate
 udhaaharan pesh karne ke liye chif justise ne apni taraf se 10 lakh rupee dene kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 Surprisingly, the collection of funds for Justice Nisar Dam was compared to the money collected during the 1965 war with India
 justise nisaar ne ummid jataayaa ki dam banane ke liye 1965 kii ladaai ke samay jaisaa junun logo main dikhegaa
 damar-bhasha Dam KP and gilgit-baltistan and Mohmand Dam are to be built on the Swat River
 pakistan ke sarvocch nyaayalay ne nirmaan kii pragati kii nigaraanee ke liye jal or vidyut vikaas praadhikaran (wapda) pramukh kii adhyakshata main ek samiti banaai or nirdesh diya ki essi ke register ke saath ek khaataa kholaa jaae jisamen sabhi daan ekatra kiye jaaenge
 It has also been said that those who donate to the cause will not be asked about their sources of income
 pakistan kii army ne bhi apni taraf se ek or do din ke vetan dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Following this appeal, a bank account was opened by the Ministry of Finance of Pakistan to collect funds
 april main hi pakistan sarkaar ne apane raksha bajet main 10 fisadi kii baari badhottaree kii thi
 Pakistan's defense budget was 999 billion rupees during the last financial year, which was increased to 11 hundred billion rupees this time
 lekin jis tarah se dam banane ke liye chanda ikkatha kiya ja rahaa he, usase pakistan kii aarthik kangaali sabake saamne he
 The economic condition of Pakistan, which stood first on the donations of the United States and now China, is becoming evident
