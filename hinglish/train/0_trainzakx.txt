 Two days after his sudden removal from the post, former Foreign Secretary Sujata Singh has attacked the Narendra Modi government
 sujatha singh ne ek tivi channel ko die intervyuu main aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne unki pratishtha ko nuksaan pahunchaaya or unke kaam ke puraane record kii andekhi kii gai
 Sujata has asked the central government the question whether it was necessary to do this? 'everything Modi and Sushma did not do' The former foreign secretary said his pain during the interview and said that the government should handle this whole matter in a good way She could also do it
 lekin achaanak ratorat hue is faisle se vah aahat huin hai
 Sujatha also alleged that it is not right to give credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj for all the work that this government has done in the last 8 months on foreign policy

 Sujatha said, "in the nuclear deal with America too, he had given many important advice to the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, but i never asked for credit for that
 'sujatha ne is baat kaa bhi daawa kiya ki pichley saal unhen videsh sachiv ke pad se hatakar kisi desh ke rajdoot yaa UPSC ke sachiv banane kaa prastaav mila tha, lekin us vakt unhone is prastaav ko thukraa diya tha kyonki wo ek sammanjanak vidaai chaahati thim

 big bos 13 main in dinon dhamaakedaar drama dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In Weekend Ka Vaar, Salman Khan exposed Arhan Khan in front of everyone
 arhan khan kii sachai saamne aane ke baad big bos ke contestants samet phens ke bich bhi hadakamp much gaya he
 But the most impact was on Rashmi Desai
 arhan par ankhen band karke bharosa karne valirashmirhan kii shaadi or bachche ke bare main itnaa bada sach jaanakar tut gai hai
 Rashmi wept bitterly in the show
 rashmi ko tutaa dekh salmaan khan big bos ke ghar main jaakar unhen sanbhaalenge or unhen samajhaayenge
 Fans are very disappointed to see Rashmi's breakdown knowing the truth of Arhan Khan and are expressing their grief for Rashmi
 soshal media par phans rashmi ko jamkar saport kar rahe hai or unhen strong rahane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Rashmi's fans are trending # staystrongrashamidesai on social media
 phans salmaan khan ke arhan kii sachai saamne laane par bhi kaaphi khush hai or aisa karne ke liye phans salmaan khan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe he
 Fans who came in support of Rashmi - one user wrote supporting Rashmi - today i understood why Salman Khan always scold and explain Rashmi
 salmaan ne ye bolaa ki wo unako hi samajhaate hai jo samajhane ke laayak hote hai
 Today Salman Khan was not a host but a brother who takes care of every girl
 salmaan rashmi kii jindagi ko bachaana chaahate hai
 Today i understand why Salman always used to bash and guide Rashami
 Cause he told woh unko hi samjhate hai jo samajhne layak hai
 And today he was no a host he was a brother who cared for a girl whom he has known since many years ans trying to save his life

 (@ivibhatweedy) December 7, 2019 shukr he soshal media kaa jisane kam se kam upi police ko chehre ke saath-saath jubaan bhi de di
 It was only because of the camera that we all saw everything from the tugbug-tugbug of the UP Police
 par kahin naa kahin lag rahaa tha ki ab bhi kuch kami he
 So suppose this deficiency was also fulfilled by a inspector of UP police
 daroga sahab baqayada vardi dhaaran kiye apane hi camere par khud ko hi shoot karte hue apane senior police afasar kii shaan main jo dialog maar rahe hai, agar aapane wo naa suna to phir kya suna
 The video of Sachin Dayal Chaudhary, the police officer of UP police, is getting very viral and this dialogue of his too
 daroga kahata he ki agar wo mere saamne pad gaye to sarkari pistal se sidhi goli marunga
 That is, one thing is clear that this officer of Moradabad Police decides on the spot
 ab to ye jaananaa banataa he ki daroga sahab kiski shamat laane vaale hai
 So listen, this police officer of UP police is not threatening any thief or crook
 balki wo sidhe apane bos sio sahab ko dhamkee de rahaa he
 Either transfer mine or CO
 varanaa sidhi goli marunga
 So the threat is clear
 wo bhi ek pulisavaale kaa ek pulisavaale ke naam
 If you can survive, then escape
 varanaa goli to sidhi maarenge
 Don't care about the consequences
 kyonki vidhayak saansad or mantri to jeb main hai hi
 He is also directly related to the UP Police's DGP
 dabang daroga ji bataa rahe hai ki unke ghar main vidhayak saansad or mantri hai
 And he has direct talks with OP Sharma, DGP of the state
 vaise bas ek dialog sahi kar lijie
 The DGP of UP Police is not OP Sharma but OP Singh Saheb
 baharhaal ye to bataaiye aapke senior adhikari or sio devendra yadav se aapaki aakhir aisi kya baat ho gai jo aap unhen sarkari pistal se sidhe goli maarane par amada hai
 Mr
 Daroga started talking

 Yes, we are listening

 We are just sitting to listen to you
 haa ab bolie
 Spitting spices, Daroga ji is telling in the video that a small thing happened yesterday morning
 subah 7 bajkar 45 minute 68 second par
 So you heard muradabad ke is hud-hud dabang daroga ne ghadi main wo baja diya
 Who could not even play the watchmaker
 7 bajkar 45 minute or 68 second
 Mr
 Daroga ji is saying that a small thing happened yesterday morning
 subah 7 bajkar 45 minute 68 second par
 Now you tell me
 kya duniya kaa koi aadmi ghadi main second kii sui se 68 baja saktaa he
 No no isiilie to kehete hai
 
 jo kahin nahin ho saktaa
 Which no one can do
 wo upi police karti he
 Anyway 
 Mr
 Daroga, you continue your story, we are listening
 daroga ji ne kahani chaalu kii
 "I was going by my personal car
 gaadi sankhya- echaar 26 es 7788 he
 "hey, where did we go again?" ye paan masala bahut pareshaan kar rahaa he daroga ji
 Do one thing, keep the spoon
 baar baar uthakar thukne kaa jhanjhat hi khatm ho jayega
 Or just leave gutkha
 acchhee aadat nahin he
 Well tell me further
 ab daroga ji bole- meri gaadi band ho gai
 There was some problem, the car hit the back and the officer of CO was coming, fought with them
 acha
 
 lekin muradabad police line ke baahar to aap kah rahe the
 On the contrary, your boss had hit your car
 aapane kaha ki subah 7 bajkar 45 minute or 48 second par sio sahab ne meri gaadi main takkar maar di thi
 Oh Sir, you were just saying that your car accidentally hit the CO sir car
 or ab aap kah rahe hai ki sio sahab ne aapaki gaadi main takkar maar di
 Well let me continue the story
 haa to aap kah rahe the ki aapaki gaadi galati se sio sahab kii gaadi se takaraa gai
 Again
 
 Says Daroga ji "I cried holding hands and feet
 maafee maangi"samaj main nahin aata ki khaane kii cheez aap thookte kyon hai or thukne kii cheez khate kyon hai
 Well tell me further
 daroga ke mutabik un sahab ne unase kaha ki betaa tera naam kya he
 Well this is the story of being shot straight from the government pistol
 lekin aapke bayaan thode ghuma rahe hai
 You threaten in front of a camera
 or duusare camere ke saamne aap mazloom ban jate hai
 Actually, it happened that these policemen were roaming in the police line of Moradabad in their personal train
 or gaadi back karte vakt inaki gadee inke senior police adhikari sio devendra yadav kii sarkari gaadi se takaraa gai
 And then Daroga ji confronted his senior
 daroga ji kehete hai ki wo mere upar haath chhodane vaale the
 They probably would have shot me
 jab poocha gaya ki daroga ji aakhir maajaraa tha kya
 Please be clear
 aap chaahate kya hai
 
 ? yaa to meri posting kara do
 Or do them
 
 Otherwise ask me to leave the son
 matlab sio sahab maafee maangenge
 So Mr
 Daroga is ready to forgive them
 phir sio sahab ko sidhi goli khaane kaa khatra nahin rahegaa
 But if you did not apologize, then you know
 vidhayak, saansad, mantri yahaan tak ki upi police ke dijipi tak daroga ji kii jeb main hai
 Well, you will meet UP DGP
 aakhir ghar kii baat jo he
 But i will also tell you when you meet
 ham sab betaab hai ye jaanane ko ki aapaki khatirdaari main dijipi sahab se koi kameen to nahin rah gai

 Sachin Pilot's reference was towards Alwar's Behror jailbreak scandal, he said that the incidents that happened should not have happened
 The Pilot also talked about rethinking the new Motor Vehicle Act
 Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot questioned the law and order of his own government
 Huh
 payalat ne buudhvaar ko jaipur main kaha ki jis tarah se rajya main kuch ghatnaayen hui hai ve nahin honi chahie thim
 Law and order is our responsibility
 payalat kaa ishaara alvar ke bahrod jailbrake cond kii taraf tha
 He said that the way the jailbreak took place in Alwar or at other places, it should not have happened
 hamaari praathamikta honi chahie ki hamaari maa-betiyaan surakshit rahen or sarkaar ko is taraf dhyaan dena chahie
 When Sachin Pilot was asked if Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot himself is in the role of Home Minister in the state, due to being part time Home Minister, law and order has deteriorated, he did not comment on it
 unhone kaha ki hamen kanoon-vyavastha ko or thik karne par dhyaan dena hoga
 In the pilot gestures, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has targeted
 apane janmdin ke avasar par bhi aaj tak se baatcheet main payalat ne kaha tha ki main us kursi par baithkar kya karuunga, agar main logon kii ankhon ke aansu nahin ponch paa rahaa hum
 He also said that the government had delayed and the SIT should have been constituted earlier in the case, while also surrounding the government in the aspect of the Khan aspect
 sachin payalat ke bayaan ke baad mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne payalat par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki yah apane-apane anubhav kii baat he
 The pilot responded by saying that a lot of people have experience in a lot of fields and also have experience with a variety of responsibilities
 bataa den sachin payalat guuruuvaar ko dilli main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane vaale hai or aise main kaha ja rahaa he ki vahaan bhi rajya kii sthiti ke bare main congressi adhyaksh ko avgat kara sakate hai
 'new motor vehicle act not practical' On the new motor vehicle act, Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has said that the Central Government's Motor Vehicle Act is not practical and one should not object to the rethinking of what is not practical 
 payalat ne kaha ki kanoon logon kii sahuuliyat or phaayde ke liye banane chahie na ki usase pareshaani paidaa ho
 Once the Gujarat government has also said that the penalty is high and it will reduce the penalty, then it is no longer the case of any party or any government
 yah sabhi kii baat ho jaati he
 One should think what is the benefit in the interest of the people
 unhone rajya sarkaar se apil kii ki is bare main punarvichaar karen
 On the other hand, Rajasthan Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariwas has made it clear that the new Motor Vehicle Act will not be implemented in Rajasthan
 rajasthan main jurmaana kam kiya jayega or jitna gujarat main kam kiya gaya he, usase zyada kam kiya jayega
 There is no point in taking a fine of â¹ 15 thousand and thirty thousand from someone whose income is â¹ 5 thousand
 ham jaldi is bare main vichaar kar logon ko raahat dene vaala faisla karenge

 is dauraan jin sthanon par shraddhaluon kii sabase zyada bheed jutati he, unamem jharkhand kaa baba baidyanathdham sabase upar he
 Baba Baidyanathdhamadvadash is one of the Jyotirlingas
 yahaan ke shivlinga kii mahatta manokamana ling ke rup main bhi hoti he
 This is the reason, not only in the spring, but there is a wave of devotees throughout the year
 log apni manokamana puri karne ke liye bholeshankar se prarthana karte hai
 There are a total of 22 temples in the Baidyanath temple complex
 puranic manyata ke anusaar, in mandiron kaa nirmaan vishwakarma ne kiya he
 Baidyanath is also worshiped under the name Ravaneshwar
 puranic katha ke anusaar, baidyanathdham main shivlinga kii sthapana lankapati ravan dwaara kii gai he
 The story goes like this
 
 
 ek baar ravan ne ghor tapasya karke bhagwaan shankar ko prasann kar liya
 Shankar asks Ravana to ask for a bride
 ravan ne ichha jataai ki vah shivlinga ko apni nagari main sthapati karnaa chahta he
 Shankarji agreed to Ravana, but added a condition to it
 shivaji ne ravan se kaha, 'shivlinga ko raste main kahin bhi nahin rakhana, nahin to main usee jagah par sthapati ho jaaoongaa
 The rapacious Ravana went from Kailashpuri to Lanka with a shivalinga
 ravan ko dekhakar devloak ke saare devtaa chintit ho gaye
 He thought that if Ravana's work was proved, he would attain immortality
 sabhi devon ne milakar vichaar-vimarsh karke isaki kaat khoji
 Here, Ravana felt a small urination with little force
 jab vah laghushanka kaa veg bardaasht nahin kar sakaa, to usne shivlinga ko ek brahman ko thama diya or hidaayat di ki use kahin bhi na rakhe
 Ravana's short-sightedness continued for so long that the Brahmin got tired of stopping the shivling and left it on the ground
 baad main ravan ne shivlinga ko vahaan se uthaane kii bahut koshish kii, par shivlinga ko uthaa na sakaa
 Finally Ravana worshiped Shivalinga at the same place
 vahi sthaan baad main rawaneshwar mahadev ke naam vikhyath hua

 com / xeb8xyhs2v â Mohit Grover (@mohitgroverat) January 25, 2018 Let us know that many such people put their phones in their mouths to check their battery
 isi prakaar kuch log sone ke sikkon ko bhi daant se kaat kar dekhte hai
 However, this is not how the quality of batteries or gold coins can be tested
 aapane kai baar olympic main bhi khilaadiyon ko medal ko chakhte hue dekha hoga
 If you follow the advice of the expert, then the phone battery should never be put in the mouth
 kyonki bydaree kai prakaar ke chemicals se banaai jaati he or lithium oin se bharpoor hoti he
 It is not necessary that every time there is such a dangerous explosion in the battery, but there is always the possibility of a spark

 rohingya sharnaarthiyon ke mudde par desh main kai baar raajnneetik bahes ho chuki he
 Now UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has also made a big statement on this issue
 bharat daure par aae hue guteras ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet kii
 He said that there are thousands of Rohingyas in India, Rohingyas will have to return to their country
 haalanki, hamen ye bhi dekhnaa hoga ki agar unhen abhi bhi vahaan par khatara he to aisa naa kiya jaae
 The problem of Rohingyas is huge, India can play an important role in solving it
 guteras bole ki abhi un jagahon (myanmar) main kaaphi kaam hona baaki he, lekin dhire-dhire hi sahi rohingyaon ko apane ilaakon main waapas janaa hi hoga
 In this conversation he also spoke on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism
 yuan chif bole ki hamane counter terarysm offis banaaya he, aatankwaad par kisi tarah kii safai nahin chalegi
 Some countries use veto power to prevent action against terrorists
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad kaaphi ahm mudda he, sirf is kshetra main nahin balki global level par bhi ye chintaa kaa vishay he
 On the problem of Jammu and Kashmir, he said that it is a matter of two countries, the powers of the UN are limited
 deshon ko hi aapas main is masale ko suljhaana he, lekin lagata he ki abhi desh iske liye taiyaar nahin hai
 On India's membership of UNSC, it is necessary to reform in the United Nations, but it cannot happen without UNSC
 aaj kii UNSC abhi paristhitiyon ke anusaar nahin he, bharat aaj global power banakar ubhar rahaa he
 There is no reason why it can be said that India is not made in UNSC
 takreeban teen maheene se samaajawaadee party (sapa) kaa netritv baagi netaa mohammad ajam khan ko waapas party main laane ke liye unki aarti utaar rahaa he, magar khan hai ki maanate hi nahin
 They are blackmailing party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav to get all their terms
 sapa kii rajnatik gatividhiyaan lagbhag thap hai or party ke netaa tathaa mulaayam kii aguai main puraa yadav parivaar lagaataar gachha de rahe ajam khan ko manaane main juta he
 He was shown an exit in May 2009 due to anti-party activities
 haalat yah he ki 22 november ko mulaayam ke 72wein janmdin par jab khud mulaayam or unke samarthakon ke elaan ke mutabik ummid kii ja rahi thi ki ajam khan party main laut aaenge, ain maukey par unhone iraadaa taal diya
 That day, Mulayam stayed in Delhi and waited for Azam Khan to return to the party
 muslim netaa ko khush karne ke liye mulaayam is had tak chale gaye ki unhone vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa pad se apane chote bhai shivpal yadav ko hataakar yah jimmedaari unhen dene kii peshkash bhi kar di, magar ajam khan ne abhi 'dekho or intjaar karo' kaa sanket diya he
 Mulayam has made up his mind to present him as the chief ministerial candidate in the 2012 assembly elections to woo Muslim votes
 ajam khan ko sapa supremeo kii 'kamajori' mana ja rahaa he, kyonki pradesh main unki sthiti lagaataar kamjor ho rahi he
 He had earlier suffered a setback in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections and after that in the recent 28 by-elections, most of the seats have gone to the bsp's account
 sapa inamen se maatr chaar main hi jeet hasil kar pai
 The SP has retained its only hold on the two seats held in November this year
 lakhimpur or nidhauli kalam, (eta) donon hi siten usne 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jiti thim
 However, in these two by-elections, the BSP was outside the ground
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad sapa netritv ko laga tha ki bhaajapa ke purv diggaj netaa kalyaan singh ko, jinhen 'babari masjid ke vidhwans ke liye jimmedaar' mana jaataa he, gale lagane kii vajah se musalmaan sapa se chhitake to use baari chunavi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, no Muslim could win on the SP ticket
 udhar, basapa ke chaar muslim ummidavaar jite the, jisase mulaayam ko jhatka laga tha
 They realized that Muslims can get away from them, whereas the Muslims along with the Yadavas are the mainstay of the SP
 alpsankhyak samudaay kaa bharosa phir se jeetne ke liye sapa pramukh ne turat-phurat nai ranneeti banaai
 The first step he took was that immediately after the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Bemuravati evicted Kalyan and his son from their camp
 iske baad unhone kalyaan se haath milaane ko lekar saarvajanik rup se bina shart maafee maangi
 Then, he prayed for the Mullahs for their political future
 unhen kai maukon par or kai shaharon main manch par badi dadhi or gol tipi pahane mullaon se aashirwad lete dekha gaya
 In a way, it was a message to the Muslim community that Muslims should support Kalyan Singh after he was pardoned by religious leaders for the 'crime' committed by shaking hands
 iske baad mulaayam sapa ke sansthaapak sadsy rahe apane puraane bharosemand ajam khan kii vaapasi kii koshish main gupachup tareeke se jute gaye
 Actually, Azam Khan was angry at the increasing dominance of former party general secretary Amar Singh in SP
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke samay ajam khan or amar singh jayprada kii ummidavaari ko lekar khuleam takaraa gaye the, par mulaayam ne ant main amar ke paksh main vito kar jayaprada kii ummidavaari kaa elaan kiya tha
 During the elections Jayaprada's opponents had blocked the walls of his Rampur area with extremely objectionable posters
 iske baavjood unka hausala post nahin hua or ve chunaav jeet gayi
 Later, Azam Khan publicly called Mulayam and Amar Singh good and bad
 chunaavon kaa daur khatm hote hi unhen party se nilambit kar diya gaya
 Initially, Mulayam Singh did not expect any positive reply from his friend turned enemy Azam Khan
 isliye unhone apane puraane dost or kaarobaari madhukar jetali ko yah jimmedaari saunpi, jinhone in donon varisht netaaon ke bich khai ko kam karne main madad kii
 It is said that after a little hesitation, Azam Khan agreed to return to SP, but he kept certain conditions
 ve chaahate hai ki unhen vipaksh ke netaa ke pad jaisi koi mahatvapurn jimmedaari di jaae, 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main tikat bantwaare kaa adhikaar mili or muslim kalyaan ke unke agenda main koi baadha na daali jaae
 On Azam Khan's insistence, the SP unilaterally canceled his suspension without any kind of regret on his part
 yahi vajah he ki jab kuch muslim vidhayakon ne ajam khan kii vaapasi par etraj kiya to party pravaktaa or mulaayam ke bhai ram gopal yadav ne unhen notice thama diya, jisase virodh ke saare swar tham gaye
 Senior party leader Shivpal is also not happy with Azam Khan's return, but he is silent
 asal main mulaayam jaanate hai ki 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav unke rajnatik vajood kii jang se kam nahin hai
 The way the Congress is emerging and despite being in power for three and a half years, there is no anti-incumbency against the BSP, Mulayam needs his muslim-yadav support base
 ajam khan ke saamne ghutane tekkar sapa pramukh ek or badi rajnatik bhul kar rahe hai
 It is true that Azam Khan is a Muslim face, an eloquent orator and also an adept at evoking the sentiments of his community, but those days are over with the Babri masjid-ayodhya issue getting colder
 mulaayam sarkaar main mantri ke rup main apane aakhri kaarykaal main ajam khan kii chhavi behad ahamkaari or janata se dur rahane vaale mantri kii rahi he or ve musalamaanon ko sapa se jode rakhane main bhi naakaam rahe
 Apart from this, the leaders of Azam Khan and SP have openly called each other so good that their credibility has been reduced
 kalyaan singh ko hi len
 He was once sacked from the BJP and was re-inducted into the party before the 2007 assembly elections, but the BJP suffered heavy electoral losses as Kalyan could neither get the respect nor the charisma as he did in Ram
 It was done in the days of Janmabhoomi movement
 ajam khan kaa rajnatik kad kalyaan jaisaa bhi nahin he, par donon ko samaan halaat kaa saamana karnaa padaa he or unki vaapasi unki partiyon ke liye boj sabit hui he
 Apart from this, Mulayam is forgetting the fact that if the Muslims were away from the SP due to welfare, the SP candidates in western Uttar Pradesh could have defeated the BJP because of their support because there is a large number of Lodh votes
 yadi mulaayam ko lag rahaa he ki ve ajam khan ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar pesh karke 2012 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeet sakate hai, to unke virdohi ajam khan ke bhadakaau bayaan kii bina par unhen kamjor karne kii koshish karenge, bhale hi ajam khan is bayaan kaa khandan karte hai
 Mulayam should know that not only Muslims but also Yadavs have lost their credibility
 musalamaanon ko lagata he ki party netritv ne hameshaa unhen chalaa he, kyonki party ke ahm pad or satta main rahete bade pad yadavon ko hi milte rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Yadavs feel that there is only one Yadav dynasty in the party and they are just a pawn in it
 mulaayam ne party ke pradesh adhyaksh or apane putr akhilesh kii patni ko firozabad ke loksabhaa upachunaav main ummidavaar banaaya tha, par vahaan yadavon ne congress ummidavaar raaj babbar ko jita diya
 This was a shock for Mulayam and then there was a message that the people of Yadav dynasty could also lose the election
 baharhaal, mulaayam ko sirf ajam khan ko lubhaane ke bajaae duusare kamjor kshetron kii ore bhi dhyaan dena chahie or pukhta ranneeti banane ke liye kathorta ke saath vishleshan karnaa chahie
 If they can woo Azam Khan, then why not extend a hand of friendship to old angry friends Beni Prasad Verma, Raj Babbar and Amar Singh, who, despite their weaknesses, helped to make SP a major force in Uttar Pradesh
 or yadi mulaayam ko lagata he ki ajam khan hi unhen is tufaan se kinare laga denge to yah samay hi batayega ki ve sahi hai yaa galat
 Amid escalating tensions between the government and the judiciary, Pakistan's Supreme Court has given an ultimatum to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and ordered him to write a letter to the Swiss administration 'immediately' regarding reopening of bribery cases against the president

 The bench issued the directive after contempt case and attorney general argued with Cabinet Secretary Nargis Sethi

 Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi has met former CM Nitish Kumar amidst sour relations and ever-increasing tension
 jaankaree ke mutabik, donon ke bich taaja siyaasi halaat ko lekar charchaa hui
 The two were not scheduled to meet in advance, but on Friday night suddenly Jeetan Ram Manjhi went to meet Nitish at his residence at 7, Circular Road, Patna
 guuruuvaar ko hi siem maanjhi ne bayaan diya tha ki ve kuch hi dinon ke liye mukhyamantri rah gaye hai
 In this context, this meeting is considered very important
 darasal, pradesh ke siyaasi halaat teji se badal rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar may have succeeded in achieving that goal by thinking that Jitan Ram Manjhi was made the Chief Minister, but now the distance between the two is constantly increasing
 jithan ram maanjhi ne rosemara ke kaam hi nahin, balki kai ahm maamalon main bhi nitish kumaar kii raay nahin lee
 This made Nitish so angry that he stopped talking to Manjhi
 haalat itani bighad gai ki nitish kumaar ne apane ghar par jab jediu ke mantriyon or padaadhikariyon ko bulaayaa, to unhone maanjhi ko aamantrit nahin kiya
 This indicated to the ministers that Manjhi is no longer a favorite character of Nitish Kumar
 bihar main aam chunaav 2015 main honge
 Nitish Kumar does not want to annoy the Mahadalits by removing Manjhi
 lekin lag rahaa he ki ve koi bada faisla karenge
 Nitish Kumar has a big challenge for BJP and he wants to take on it with the help of casteism
 lekin maanjhi ko hataane se unhen apane is abhiyaan main dhakka lag saktaa he
 However, there is increasing possibility that Jitan Ram Manjhi will leave the chair soon
 unhone khud hi ye sanket die hai or kaha he ki ve kuch hi dinon ke liye mukhyamantri hai
 Now if Manjhi leaves this important post, then JDU supremo Nitish Kumar will have a big problem, because he created Manjhi to please the Mahadalits of Chief Minister Bihar
 vaise maanjhi hameshaa vivaadon main ghire rahe hai
 They have been making such statements many times, which cause controversy
 kai baar ve kuch aise kaam bhi karte hai, jisase nitish kumaar kii naaraazgi badhati jaati he
 Recently, Nitish Kumar got angry with him that he had made his son-in-law his drink and nephew as a peon
 is maamle ke khulne ke baad unhone damaad ko us pad se hataa diya
 However, the politics of Bihar seems to be slowly and boiling

 dilli nagar nigam chunaav ho chuke hai
 Now the results will come on 26th of April, but the exit polls before that did not bring good news for the Aam Aadmi Party
 punjab-goa vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad MCD agsit pole bhi AAP ke liye niraashaa bhare hai
 MCD elections are of special importance for the Aam Aadmi Party, which formed the government in Delhi with a sweeping victory 2 years ago
 chunaavon ke nateezon ko sidhe-sidhe dilli main kiye gaye 'aap' ke kaamon se jodakar dekha jayega
 But the results of the first Punjab and Goa assembly elections and then the subsequent MCD exit polls are showing that the magic of 'AAP' is disappearing, on which it won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi
 chunaavon main lagaataar girtaa graph bataata he kiarvind kejarivalki jameen dilli main khisak rahi he
 The magic of Kejriwal and his party has disappeared, which was at or before the 2015 assembly elections
 emsidi chunaavon main bhi unhone bijepi, uparajyapal or iviem par zyada hamalaa kiya, naa ki pichley 2 saalon main kiye gaye unke kaamon ke bare main baat kii
 In the last 2 years, the Aam Aadmi Party took many such decisions or created conditions for them, due to which their land in Delhi became weak
 1) baar-baar dilli se baahar janaa2015 vidhansabha chunaavon main AAP party ne 5 saal kejariwal ke naare par chunaav ladaa tha
 But even after this, the Aam Aadmi Party contested elections in Punjab and Goa, which went against them
 punjab main to kejariwal ke naam par hi party ne vot maanga
 Many times during the Punjab elections, there was a message that Kejriwal would leave Delhi and take over the command of Punjab
 is dauraan 'aap' kaa prabhutv dilli main lagaataar kam hota chalaa gaya
 Along with this, Generalrail Singh, MLA from Rajouri Garden, Delhi resigned from the party and went to contest in Punjab elections
 janrail singh punjab main bhi chunaav haar gaye or party kii dilli main ek seat bhi kam ho gai
 BJP won the by-election held here, while AAP stood at number three
 2) vaadon par khare naa utaranaam aadmi party ne 2015 main bade-bade vaade kar dilli main satta kabjai thi
 But with the formation of the government, the image of the party started to form that it was not able to fulfill the promise
 dilli sarkaar ne kai baar vaade puure naa hone ke liye centre sarkaar par rode atakane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The people of Delhi trusted less on this argument
 vaai-faai, sisitivi camere jaise vaadon ko puraa na kar paane se sarkaar kii nakaaratmak chhavi bani
 3) Accusations on Ministers With the formation of the government in Delhi, the ministers of AAP government started accusing them of corruption and various kinds
 sarkaar kaa koi mantri farji degree par ghira to koi sex sidi main funs gaya
 From ministers to leaders, there were serious allegations that many of them went to jail
 shungalu cameti kii report main bhi kejariwal sarkaar main faile bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad logon ke saamne aa gaya
 4) Continuously targeting Modi: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal did not leave any chance to attack PM Modi personally
 kai baar to seemaa laanghte hue kejariwal ne modi par aapattijanak tippanee bhi kii
 Modi never retaliated on these attacks by Kejriwal
 kejariwal ne modi par us daur main nishaanaa saadhaa, jab modi kii lokapriyata main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 Apart from Modi, Kejriwal was also constantly in the news for targeting the Lieutenant Governor
 5) bade netaaon ko baahar karnaam aadmi party ne andolan ke samay se hi apane saath rahe yogendra yadav, prashanth bhushan or anand kumaar jaise bade or saaf chhavi ke netaaon ko satta main aate hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 These leaders also started speaking against the party as soon as they got out, which led to the negative image of the party
 iske alaava party ke bade or lokapriy chehre kumaar vishwaas ne party main hote hue bhi netaaon se duuri bana lee
 On many occasions, Kumar Vishwas also criticized the government and Kejriwal
 emsidi chunaavon main kumaar vishwaas ne party ke liye prachaar tak nahin kiya

 Actually, the response of the common people in Aam Aadmi Party's 'aap Daan' campaign is very cold
 kaaryakartaaon ko chhod den to aam log apane ghar ke daravaaje tak bhi nahin khol rahe hai
 Similarly, people are not showing interest in giving donations

 Gopal Rai started by asking for donations for charity, running door to door campaign in Maujpur, East Delhi and asking for donations from door to door
 jab dilli ajtak samvaadadaata ne unase poocha,"aisa lag rahaa he ki chanda jabardasti maanga ja rahaa he" to unhone is baat se inkaar kiya

 After this embarrassing and sensational statement, Nirbhaya's family has strongly condemned Mukesh Singh
 unhone kaha ki ve iske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karenge
 The girl's mother said that her daughter's statement of the crime is very embarrassing and a mockery of the law
 nirbhaya kii maa ne kaha, 'yah kanoonee prakriya ke lacheelepan kaa nateeja he ki jail main band hone ke baad bhi mujrim apni ghinauni harakat ko uchit tehraane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 ' unhone kaha ki aisa hota to ladakiyon or mahilaon se hone vaali khaufnak ghatnaon par bhi roak lagane main madad milti
 The girl's brother also strongly condemned this statement and said that the family would take legal action against Mukesh's statement
 unhone media par bhi doshi vyakti ke bayaan ko tarjeeh dekar use mahimamandit karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Bhai said, 'the way the media showed that statement is condemnable
 'gauratlab he ki 16 disambar 2012 ko chalati bas main gangrape ke doshi mukesh ne apane ek intervyuu main rape ke liye nirbhaya ko hi doshi tehraaya he

 pujaara, jinhen rahul dravid kii jagah team india kii nai diwaar kaha ja rahaa tha, unhen test team main number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par jagah hi nahin mili
 That too when Pujara returned after performing well in county cricket

 Book Abstract This book has been woven around the history of the execution and reporting of death sentence given to a killer on October 25, 1978 in Raipur Jail
 ab kaa naam lehan, ham to jaat hain
 
 
 Just show us our boys
 
 
 '' transistor or aisi hi choti-moti chizon ke laalach main chaar logon kii hatya karne vaale rambharosa urf bharosa urf baiju ko jab raipur kendriya jail main faansee ke fande par bheja ja rahaa tha, to uski yahi pratikriya thi
 An illiterate tribal is not ready to take Ram's name, despite repeated calls by Panditji just before the death penalty
 vah kabhi sarguja ke apane adivasee ilaake se baahar nahin gaya, lekin raashtrapati ne bhi jab uske maut ke paravaane par muhar laga di, to vah baar-baar guhaar lagaataa he ki elahabaad ke mullah vakil ko bula do, vah use faansee se bachaa legaa
 Actually Baiju was referring to advocate Anand Narayan Mulla who later became the chairman of the All India Committee on Jail Reforms (1980â83)
 jab jailwale usase baar-baar poochhate hai ki marane se pehle kisi rishtedaar se milanaa he to vah khamosh rahata he par jab faansee kaa fanda saamne aayaa to apane beton se milane kii fariyaad karata he
 Stunned jail officials ask that you have been asked for so long that you want to meet a relative, then you said no and now the hanging is in front, then you are talking about meeting the boys
 is par baiju kaa jawaab nyaay vyavastha kii bhashaa ko kathghare main khadaa karata he, ''aap to rishtedaaron ko bulaane kii baat kah rahe the, beton ko bulaane kii baat kahaan kahi
 "and just before the execution, when the perpetrator's hands are tied with a rope behind his back, the jail superintendent has to inhale cigarettes with his hand and smoke himself
" faansee kii sajaa ke ye aise prasang hai jo filmon yaa sahitya main nahin milte
 Since Girijashankar, the author of this book, is not a litterateur but a journalist, and no fictional character who is hanged is a real killer, a flat description of the whole incident is possible
 saamaanya taur par sapatabayani nakaaratmak dhwani lekar aati he par is kitaab kii yahi khaasiyat he ki jab-jab lekhak apni ore se kuch jodne kii koshish nahin karata, tabhi is aprihaary maanviya traasadee kaa sabase bhavuk varnan khud-ba-khud hone lagata he
 As the book focuses on the official reporting of the hanging incident after government permission, the author also weaves historical and legal processes in the midst of the description of the prisoner's move to the gallows
 academik mahatv kii ye baaten kathakram ko todatii hai par vishay kii samgr samaj banane main madadgaar sabit hoti hai
 Especially today when TV and politicians are loudly talking about the brutal death penalty of rapists, this book indicates that these are regressive thoughts
 sabhyataaon ne hajaaron saal ke vikaas kram main sajaa dene main khud ko sabhy banaaya he or iskaa mul uddeshy aparaadh rokna he, aankh ke badale aankh nikaalnaa nahin
 Yes, one thing and mention of Gangaram effigy, you will find it very interesting
 yah vah putala he, jis par faansee dene se pehle faansee kii reharsal hoti he
 Many such specifics have come up in the book in a very interesting way
 loksabhaa main aitihaasik jiesti bill ko paas karaane ke liye charchaa ho rahi thi
 Meanwhile, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav came
 shuruyaat main hi mulaayam ne kaha ki jiesti bill to paas ho jayega
 Just then Mulayam changed his line length
 mulaayam kii vaani se phir duusari baaten hi nikaleen, mulaayam bole jiesti to thik he, lekin sadan ko garibon ke liye kanoon laana chahie, koi garib bhookha naa rahe, koi garib yaa kisaan aatmahatya naa kare, is par sarvasammati se kanoon banaaya jaae
 Everyone was shocked that Mulayam Singh started talking about these things in the discussion on GST
 sabhi kaa chaunkna laazmi tha, lekin mulaayam siyasat ke manze hue khilaadi hai
 In a short time it became clear that Mulayam was making a role to express his pain
 ji haa, upi main haar kaa dard tha, jisko mulaayam bayaan karnaa chaahate the
 Mulayam said, all the promises made by our government have been fulfilled
 muft padhai se lekar muft dawaai tak kaa vaada yaad dilaa diya mulaayam ne
 After that Mulayam only said that despite fulfilling all the promises we lost the election
 mulaayam yaheen nahin thame, tab chair par baithe raman deka ne yaad dilaayaa ki are bhai charchaa to jiesti par ho rahi he
 Mulayam again said that he will pass, but despite fulfilling all his promises in UP, we lost the election, there too 'modi Modi, Jai Modi Jai Modi'
 jhuthe vaade karke chunaav jeet gaye or itane bahumat se jite, jitani ummid to khud bijepi ke logon ne bhi nahin kii hogi
 Mulayam, in his speech, did not forget to give the BJP a chance that the people of UP also know the reversal

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ek baar gujarat ke ran main baaji maarane ke liye janata ke bich pahunche hai
 In the third phase of Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra, Rahul's focus is South Gujarat
 saath hi unke agenda main yuva tikdi ke samarthan ko antim rup dena bhi he
 Preparations are also in full swing with discussion inside the party for this
 rahul ne apni pichhali gujarat yatra main obisi netaa alpesh thakor ke saath manch saajha kiya tha
 During this time Alpesh officially joined the Congress
 jiske baad patidaar netaa hardik patel or dalit netaa jignesh mevani ko saadhane kii koshishen tej huin
 State leaders of the Congress met with the Patidars on one side in Gujarat
 vahiin gujarat ke prabharee ashok gahalout aarambhik baatcheet ke baad jignesh mevani ko rahul gandhi se milaane dilli le aae
 However, Mevani did not reach to meet Rahul
 jiske baad rahul buudhvaar ko apane prastaavit daure ke tahat gujarat pahunch gaye
 This journey of Rahul will last till 3 November
 yatra ke antim din rahul surat main vishaal jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 According to party sources, this day is going to be very important for the Congress
 party ke varisht netaa ke mutabik, 'jo baatcheet chal rahi he, agar vah kaamyaab ho jaati he, to surat kii raily main chaunkaane vaala najaara dekhne ko milegaa'
 Will Hardik and Mevani come to the dais? Questions are being raised by the claims of Congress sources whether Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani will officially announce their support to the Congress by sharing the stage with Rahul Gandhi at the Surat rally? Actually, after Alpesh Thakor, Congress wants to get the support of Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani as soon as possible
 iske peeche kai vajahen hai
 The first is that Congress wants to try to close the path of Patidars to go with BJP by bringing Hardik along
 kyonki haal hi main ye bhi khabar ai he ki patidaar aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke rashtriya sanyojak aswin patel bijepi ke sampark main hai
 They believe that the BJP is able to fulfill the conditions of the Patidars instead of the Congress
 doosraa vajah ye he ki congress hardik or jignesh ko saath laakar tikat bantwaare par bhi mantranaa shuru karnaa chaahati he
 For this, however, a meeting has been called by the screening committee of the party, in which tickets are to be discussed
 dilachasp baat ye he ki screening cameti kii meeting bhi 3 november ko hi honi he jo agle do din or yojit kii jaaegi
 Apart from Vasava, the church triumvirate, Congress is also trying to make JDU leader Chhotubhai Vasava a part of its 'grand Alliance'
 congress mahasachiv ashok gahalout pehle hi vasava ke saath kai daur kii meeting kar chuke hai
 Party sources say that if an alliance is formed, the Congress hopes to gain in many seats, along with Vasava
 kul milakar gandhinagar se lekar dilli tak charchaa or baithkon kaa daur garam he
 The Congress has agreed to four major demands of the Patidars
 ab aarakshan par congress ko apana rukh spasht karnaa he, jiske liye hardik patel ne unhen 7 november tak kii mohalat di he
 In such a situation, it will now be seen whether the Congress will conclude a deal with Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Chhotubhai Vasava before Rahul's Surat rally
 agar aisa hota he to mumkin he rahul kii surat raily main koi chaunkaane vaala najar aae

 Mamta insisted that to vote for the party meant to vote for herself and strengthen her hands to fight the 'communal rioters (narendra) Modi- (amit) Shah's party' ie BJP
 loksabhaa ke ummidavaaron kii unki fehrist main ek-do nausikhuon ke alaava filmi sitare or duusari partiyon ke 21 dalbadalu shaamil hai
 The Chief Minister knows that there will be turmoil in the party, but she is full of confidence
 isiilie unhone kaha, ''jo bhi janaa chahta he, jane ke liye aaazaad he
 i don't care, they are free to go
 
 
 '' teen saal pehle, 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se ain pehle, jab ve chautarafa chunautiyon se jujh rahi thim or sharada tathaa naarad ghotaalon main unki party ke ummidavaaron ke naam saamne aa rahe the, tab bhi mamata ne logon se aisi hi apil kii thi, ''sabhi 294 siton par mamata banerjee ummidavaar he
 i am a candidate in all 294 seats and i request that i vote
 '' us chunaav main party ne 219 siten jiti thim
 Now it is the turn to win all 42 seats in the Lok Sabha, so that Mamata can secure her place in national politics and come closer to the Prime Minister's chair
 yahi vajah he ki mamata is chunaav ko ek nayaa mode de rahi haiâdesh main pehla bengali pradhanmantri banane kii khatir rajya ke liye yah 'karo yaa maro' sareekha chunaav he, ''yah maamuli chunavi ladaai nahin he
 
 
 It is a fight to save the country and its constitution
 '' party ke sadasyon ne ek nayaa fasebuk pej bhi bana liya heâ''chulo badalaai, ek bengali prodhan montri chaai
 "bengal has missed the opportunity twice â Pranab Mukherjee in 1991 and Jyoti Basu missed the prime minister's post in 1997
 haalanki pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shaamil tamaam talabgaaron main mamat khud ko mahaj 'elypi' (kam ahm shaks) bataa rahi hai, magar unki party ke log rajya ke votaron ko lamaband karne ke liye pradhanmantri card kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 In Bengali Asmita v
 Hindutva Bhajpa East, it is trying to mobilize Hindu votes in various states by supporting the National Citizenship Register (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 vahiin mamata ne dharm ke bajaae bhashaayi or kshetreey pahchaan par jor dekar ek bengali nerrative rachane main vakt nahin ganvaaya
 In every public meeting she describes how "names with Bengali surnames, both Hindu and Muslim, have been removed
" yah or kuch nahin balki enarasi ke naam par bengali khedaao yani bengali andolan kaa jaateey safaya he
 This rhetoric intensified when Assam woke up and news came that Bengali-speaking 'outsiders' were committing suicide in the northeast
 isi ke saath mamata or unki party ke netaa bhaajapa ko 'bahari' qaraar de rahe hai, yani aisi party jo multah hindipattee kii party he or jise rajya kii samskruti, parampara or jabaan kii jaankaree nahin he
 The BJP had to bring its national leaders from the central headquarters for its programs, the party does not have any prominent Bengali face of the state, all of whom were beaten up as an insult to the state
 yahaan tak ki bengal ke sabhi boothon ko atisamvedansheel ghoshit karne kii bhaajapa kii maang kii bhi mamata ne tikhi aalochana kii
 When the BJP accused Mamata of Muslim appeasement, the Chief Minister was initially worried
 unhone reliyon main hindu mantra padhe or gangasagar, tarapith, dakshineshwar or kalighat sareekhe hindu tirthasthalon par vikaas kaaryon kaa bhi elaan kiya
 Allowances for pandits and priests were also announced
 rabindra bharti vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor vishwanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''magar jaldi hi unhen ehsaas ho gaya ki khayraton ke hatkande se kattar hinduon kaa samarthan hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 That is why they are trying to cement their Muslim vote bank
 pulavama or balakot hawaii hamale ke baad unki pratikriya satark or nappi-tuli thi
 "right there," says socialist Prashant Ray about Mamata's question on Pulwama and Balakot, "mamata deliberately raised these questions because she was thinking about her 28 per cent Muslim vote bank
" jab siyaasi ladaai bhaajapa or congress sareekhee do badi siyaasi partiyon ke bich ho or sawaal yah ho ki centre main dharmanirpeksh sarkaar hogi yaa nahin, aise main musalmaan hameshaa congress ko surakshit daanv maanenge
 "therefore, in order to not allow Muslim votes to be divided in the state of Mamata, the intelligence of the Center in Pulwama is loudly raising the issue
 ve bhaajapa kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hue baar-baar kah rahi hai, ''aap khun bahane par raajnneeti nahin kar sakate
 i congratulate him (BJP) for trying to get votes on the death of the soldiers
 ''jagaai-madhai-bidaaicongress or vam dalon (trikoniya ladaai main bhaajapa ke alaava do anya vipakshi partiyaan) ne rajya main chunavi samjhaute kaa mansuba banaaya, magar vah taar-taar ho gaya
 Mamta is constantly saying that there is a secret agreement between the three (jagai-madhai-bidai, in which Jagai and Madhai are the sinners of Bangla folklore and 'bidai' is for the BJP whose time has come to relieve) 
 chakravarti kehete hai, ''congress or vam dalon ke bich chunaav-purv samjhaute kii chot bhaajapa par padati
 But now BJP seems to be benefiting
 ''is sabake bich mamata rafel ghotaale or rajnatik badale ke liye sarkari agenciyon ke istemaal ke muddon ko jor-shor se uthaa rahi hai, taaki congress ke un samarthakon ko khush kar saken jo vamapanthiyon ke saath meljol ko lekar pareshaani mahasoos kar rahe hai
 He also sent secret messages to the leaders of the state Congress, who were against giving the CPM two important seats in Raiganj and Murshidabad to strengthen the alliance
 congress ke ek diggaj netaa ne kaha, ''rahul gandhi ne jis tarah in do siton par hamaari bhaawanaaon ko nazarandaaj kiya he, usase tiemasi yaa bhaajapa ko hi phayda hoga
 Announcing the list of candidates on all kinds of issues, Mamata raised women's issues and said that 41 per cent of her candidates would be women
 mahila votaron par hameshaa se unki najar rahi he
 At the same time, in her first term in power (2011-2016), Mamata, riding on the politics of Khairait, has also increased the number of Khairaites
 aarthik taur par kamjor tabakon main bal vivaah ko rokane ke liye shuru kii gai kanyashri yojana main ab sabhi balikaon ko shaamil kar liya gaya he, phir chaahe parivaar kii aamadani jitani bhi ho
 Mamta has made treatment in government hospitals free of cost for families living below the poverty line as well as families living above this line
 tiemasi ke mantri parth chatarji kehete hai, ''yah centa (cloj) ke jhole kii tarah he jisamen sabhi ke liye kuch na kuch he, chaahe ve boul (lok gayak) hon, yaa jatra ke adaakaar, berozegaar noujvaan, chaay baganon ke kaamgaar, schuli bachche, garbhvatee maatayen, avivaahit ladkiyaan yaa bujurg pensionbhogi hon, yahaan tak ki antyeshti karne ke liye bhi khayraaten hai
 The budget fixed on social welfare schemes is Rs 20,000 crore
 pahunch gaya he
 The state already has 30 universities and this year the Chief Minister laid the foundation stone of the first Hindi University in the state of Howrah, Harichand Gurchand University and Kanyashree University in North 24 Parganas
 paryaavarnavidon ke liye rajya main ab west bengal green uniwarsity bhi he
 Faces, new ones, old Bhimmata have been emphasizing on well-known faces that are socially and politically accepted
 par jab ummidavaaron kii suchi ai to tiemasi netaa tak bhauchak rah gaye
 The ten sitting mps were ticketed, but those who were replaced were no better
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''hairaani se zyada hamen dhakka laga he
 The Opposition (left) is already hawking the 'modi-didi' pact, in such a situation that they have given them a chance to win 10-12 seats easily
 '' haalanki mamata ne bhi is baat kaa zikr kiya ki party ke kuch netaa unke faisle ke khilaaf kaam kar sakate hai
 But she is sure that her glamor girls will show their magic
 inamen se ek bangla adaakara nusrat jahaan hai
 They are the trump card of Didi in Basirhat
 bashirhaat baar-baar sampradayik lapaton main ghirta he or inke natijatan vahaan hindu dhruvikaran he
 The incumbent MLA Idris Ali's ticket has been cut due to alleged complicity in these incidents
 nusrat apni star apil ke chalate hindu voton ke kuch hisse ko apni ore khinch sakati hai
 Mamta believes that voters are still fascinated by her and the magic of 'mamta Magic' is intact, so she is confident that she will win well in this Lok Sabha election as well
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar rajdhani ke nijee aspataalon kii nakel kasne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Recently, Max Hospital of Delhi has caught a lot in the case of declaring an innocent newborn baby dead
 dilli sarkaar ne jahaan swasthya vibhaag ko is maamle main jaanch karke report saunpane ko kaha he
 The police is also investigating the matter by registering an FIR
 kyonki maamla andekhi auralaaparvaahise judaa he, isliye kejariwal sarkaar aise nijee aspataalon ke khilaaf kadi kaarywahi karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said during an event at Maulana Azad Hospital in Delhi that the government would take legal steps against such careless private hospitals
 haalanki arvind kejariwal ne yah bhi kaha ki vah privet aspataalon ko band karne kii manshaa nahin rakhte or na hi unke kaam kaaj main kisi tarah kaa khalal paidaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Referring to the recent incident in which a hospital in Gurgaon saw a bill of Rs 10 lakh from the family after the child died of dengue and Max Hospital declared the newborn dead, Kejriwal said that to tighten such incidents Is required
 jab jab nijee aspataalon main aisa aapraadhik laaparvaahee hogi to sarkaar chup nahin baithegi or hastkshep jarur karegi
 Arvind Kejriwal said that his government does not ignore the role of private sector and private hospitals, but many private hospitals in the capital are defaming it which the government will not tolerate
 dilli sarkaar ke sutara bataate hai ki sarkaar philhal aise nijee aspataalon par najar rakh rahi he
 The government has not yet clarified any picture on the government intervention and legal avenues that Arvind Kejriwal has talked about
 maujuuda kanoonon main nijee aspataalon ke khilaaf aisi ghatnaon main kaarywahi karne ke liye kanoon maujuud hai
 At present, the Delhi government has not made it clear whether it wants to come up with a new draft in the Assembly to clamp down on private hospitals
 samaajawaadee party netaa or upi sarkaar ke mantri ajam khan ne apane ek nae bayaan se pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Azam Khan said on changing the name of Planning Commission to NITI Aayog, that the policy making work is done by the government and it is the commission's job to follow that policy and that is why the commission is formed
 unhone kaha ki ab piem chahen to wo uskaa naam niti ayog rakhen yaa pariyojna ayog or yaa phir uskaa naam godse ayog rakh den
 Azam said that he feels that the officer to whom the responsibility of changing the name of the Planning Commission was written by Modi ji was probably read less, hence he gave this name

 Talking about the alliance of Congress and Samajwadi Party continuing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that even more secular parties will join this alliance till the Lok Sabha elections

 Something happened to the photographer after which he would think twice before taking a selfie in the forest
 darasal, soshal netwarking site redit par hamaari nigaah is tasviir par thithak gai
 It is clearly seen in the picture that the squirrel is landing on the bite of a person
 lekin gilahari ke is 'atitude' ke peeche bhi ek vajah he
 Actually, the man who took a walk on the jungle thought of taking a selfie with the squirrel
 lekin shaayad gilahari ko yah baat acchhee nahin lagi
 Just as the flash flashed, the squirrel's anger erupted
 jis vakt yah hamalaa ho rahaa tha, photographer kii maa bhi vahaan maujuud thim
 But instead of saving her son, she was enjoying this view
 unhone fat se is 'gilahari atake' ko camere main kaid kar liya
 There was no interest in photographing this squirrel who foraged in the forests of Tampa Bay, Florida
 uski nishaanaa to vah phone tha jisase photo lee ja rahi thi
 If the phone was not received, then fired his anger on the photographer ab netaaon ke vaadon par se 58 varshiya achchhelal kaa aitbaar uth chukaa he

 As if a mountain of sorrows broke on the Raichas Dalit caste, who lived in Majra Madhopur of Pandui Gram Panchayat of Banda district in Bundelkhand

 On 15 January 2008, Rahul Gandhi's helicopter landed in a field in Madhopur, when information was received about the poverty of Achilal and his condition
 jawan bete kii maut se tut chuke achchhelal chalane-phirane main asamarth the to sthaneey netaa unhen charpai samet uthaakar rahul gandhi se milwane le gaye
 Rahul gave good faith to all possible help to Achilal
 jhopadi par pakkaa makaan bana dene kaa vaada kiya
 Waiting for the promise to be fulfilled, Achilal kept counting days
 hafte, maheene guzarate hue aath saal se zyada samay biit gaya
 Achilal got TB
 ankhen kamjor ho gayi
 In the accident while working in the field, the right eye of the second son burst
 kai chunaav aae or gaye, lekin achchhelal se kiya rahul gandhi kaa vaada kabhi puraa nahin hua
 Yes, due to the kindness of Pradhan, a scarlet ration card below the poverty line has definitely been made
 isi varsh 14 janvari ko mukhya sachiv alok ranjan ne bhi pandui main hi raat guzari
 Pandui, who has got the status of Lohia village, was shone brightly, but in the midst of this glare, no one noticed the house of Achilal
 lekin is gaanv se 80 kimi dur uttar-pashchim disha main hamirpur ke maudaha block kaa gusiyaari gaanv itnaa abhaagaa nahin tha
 The vote was to be taken, so the leaders made 10-12 hand pumps before every election in this village having a Muslim population of 12,000

 But the irony is that 90 per cent of these are defective and those which are fine are spewing saline water
 inaki sud lene vaala koi nahin
 Three kilometers away from the village, a well of the ancestors in the field is the only water reservoir for the entire village

 sawaal ye he ki aakhir donon kahaan gum ho gaye?diwali kii chhuttiyon main ek joda shahar kii bheed-bhaad se dur dilli se yahaan ghoomane pahunchaa tha
 It was evening and both were not finding any place to live in this small town
 aise main pehle to donon ne yahaan se nikalne ke liye kisi taxi kii talash kii, lekin jab is koshish main bhi naakaami haath lagi, to unhone chakaarata se nikalne ke liye ek par persenwaali taxi main baith janaa thik samajha
 This taxi was going towards Tiger Fall, Uttarkashi
 taxi driver ne donon ko uttarkashi kii taraf le chalane kaa bharosa diya or kaha ki wo raste main kisi jagah par unke thaharne kaa intjaam bhi karvaa degaa, lekin dilli se aae abhijit or maumita ke saath iske baad kuch aisa hua, jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 On 29 October, Moumita's family wrote a report of her daughter's disappearance at Saket police station in Delhi
 dilli police ne fouran chaanbin shuru kii or iske saath hi use ek chaunkaanewaali baat pataa chali
 The mobile phones of both Abhijeet and Moumita were already switched off, but surprisingly the last call from these numbers was made to a local number
 ji haa, ek local number, jiskaa phone kaa maalik koi raju das tha, lekin police tab or sakate main aa gai, jab usne paaya ki raju kaa mobile phone bhi 23 oktober se hi lagaataar band tha
 The investigation progressed and it was soon discovered that Raju Das was none other than Chakrata, a taxi driver

 On November 6, Vikasnagar police took Raju Das into custody after Maumita's family members and the Delhi Police told him, but his family members looking for both were shocked when they came to know that there was no specific information from the taxi driver Raju
 Upon receiving the police left him after questioning
 idhar, maamle kii tafteesh karti hui dilli police kii ek team bhi tab tak chakraata or vikasnagar pahunch chuki thi, lekin isi bich is maamle ke pehle suspect yani driver raju das ne ek aisi harakat kii, jisase police ke kaan khadey ho gaye
 After getting rid of the clutches of the police, Raju first turned on his mobile and then put a new SIM card in it and just this act of his, once again brought Raju on the radar of the police
 duniya kii najaron se ojhal hone se pehle abhijit or maumita aakiri baar jis shaks ke saath dekhe gaye the, wo ek baar phir se police ke kabje main tha, lekin is baar uski ek harakat use kaanoon ke jaal main fansaa chuki thi
 Now Chakrata's taxi driver Raju Das was once again in police custody
 police kii sakhti ke saamne raju ne bilkul kisi tote kii manind puri kahani bayaan kerani shuru kar di
 He told how on the evening of 22 October, Abhijeet and Moumita were looking for a hotel in Chakrata and meanwhile they decided not to go to Uttarkashi in Raju's taxi
 haalanki raju se baat karne ke baad donon ne jab kuch der or hotel dhundhane kaa faisalaa kiya, raju ko apane doston ke saath milakar donon ko luutane kii saazish rachane kaa mauka mil gaya
 Raju and his three friends had landed on their reality

 Jaswant told that Vajpayee picked up a paper and started writing his resignation

 Advani had claimed that he was against the decision to release terrorists in exchange for passengers
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki singh ke saath aatankwaadiyon ko qandahar le jane ke nirnay se unka kuch lenaa dena nahin tha
 Asked the reason for Advani not making the claims of these claims earlier, Singh said that at that time he wanted to save his senior party colleague

 Shatwari looked at her form in the mirror while wiping the mascara that had spread under her eyes
 nae-nae yauvan kaa dhyaan apane rup ko sanvaarane se kahin adhik use nihaarne main laga rahata he
 Kajal in the big eyes glowing on the round face from the full moon, bright red dot between the eyebrows, headlines adorned with thin juicy lips, mongre dynasty hanging in open hair, gold earrings in ears and red pearl studded around the neck
 a garland of gold, he felt his form as if the black holes had come down on the banks of two lakes in a valley covered with flowers
 âkya isse acha shringaar bhi kiya ja saktaa he?â atharah varsh kii gehuen rang, madhyam kad or charhari kaaya vaali shatvari ne qamar par bandhi chaandi kii karadhani ko naabhi se thodaa neeche sarakaaya or phir apni qamar par haath pherati hui muskura uthi
 'oh, how long has Aditi been waiting
 pandit achyut acharya se sangeet seekhney janaa he
 Acharyaji is punctual
 âshatvari daudti hui baahar ai jahaan belon se juti ek gaadi par baithi aditi uski pratiksha kar rahi thi
 'what was the need to decorate so much? Learning music is to go to Acharya ji, not to any Gandharva, 'aditi sarcastically looked at Shatavari
 âkya pataa raste main kisi gandharva kii hi drushti pad jaaen,âshatvari ne khilakhilaate hue kaha
 Sitting next to Aditi in a baggy-shaped bullock cart, Shatwari signaled the trainman to walk
 âpandit achyut acharya ke ghar chalanaa he na?â belon ko haankate hue gaadiwan ne poocha
 Yes, they teach us music
 bina bahon kii cholii par se dhalak aae gulabi dupattey ko sambhalate hue shatvari ne kaha
 She was so engrossed in herself that she even forgot to cover her arms with a scarf
 âaap badi bhaagyashaalee hai jo acharya ji aapako sangeet sikhaa rahe hai
 There is no one else in the entire state who knows the music like him, 'said the carman, tightening the bull's rein
 âhaa, ve mere pita pandit aditya shastri ke puraane mitra hai
 That is why we are teaching music
 nahin to unka shishy bananaa bhi itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Covering her arms with a scarf, Shatwari glided down the silky choli that had climbed up
 âshastri ji kaa sammaan to puure gaanv main he
 It is difficult to find scholars like him and knowledge of Vedas and scriptures
 âgaadiwan ke munh se apane pita kii prashansa sunakar shatvari ko acha laga
 The vermillion aura of pride flashed on her face
 âgaadi vaale
 
 
 Before the completion of Shatwari's address, the trainman said, 'my name is Gunjan
 âgunjan saanwale rang kaa oonche kad kaa lagbhag bees varsh kaa yuvak tha
 His body was single but stiff
 uskaa lanbaa cheharaa, jis par halki dadhi ugi hui thi, kaaphi aakarshak tha
 He tied the black hair coming to the shoulders and tied it backwards, making his big and bulging forehead visible
 usne qamar par safed rang kii dhoti baandhi hui thi or uskaa ek bhaag sharir ke upree hisse par bhi daalaa hua tha
 Around the neck was a garland of black thread in which a silver coin was threaded
 kaanon main chaandi kii choti baaliyaan pahani hui thi
 'wow! Gunjan! There is music in your name, 'shatwari said with a laugh
 phir use apana parichay dete hue kaha, âmeraa naam shatvari he, or yah he meri saheli aditi
 Then after stopping for a while, Shatwari asked, 'gunjan do you know music?' 'music is a tradition of the Vedas
 main tehra ek shudra
 Where can i learn music? ' a light layer of desperation emerged on Gunjan's face
 âsangeet vedon kii nahin saanson kii parampara he
 Knowledge of Vedas can be helpful, but not necessary, to learn music
 sangeet to koyal kii kook or bhanvare ke gunjan main bhi he
 "you are right
" sargam or raag-raagini kaa to mujhe koi gyaan nahin par doston ke saath baramasi or phag gaate-gaate thodaa bahut gaanaa to main bhi sikh gaya hum
 The priests of the Shitala temple in our hamlet play the flute very well
 unhone mujhe bansuri bajaanaa bhi sikhaaya he,âgunjan ne apni kuch ruchiyan ginate hue kaha
 a sweet smile swept across his face, removing the layer of despair
 âare vaah, phir to tum hamen koi geet sunaao
 See how you sing
 is tarah rasta bhi cat jayega,â aditi ne shatvari or gunjan ke vaartalap main kudate hue kaha
 This sudden request of Aditi caused Gunjan to blush
 usne kuch sharamaate hue kaha, âaap log to acharya ji kii shishyaa he
 'you must know very good music
 meraa gaanaa sunakar to aap hansengi
 "don't be shy, the song is sung with the mind, and someone laughs even at the sound of the mind!" Shatwari gave Gunjan's courage
 gunjan ke honton par ek muskaan ubhar ai
 He liked to talk about this intimacy of Shatavari
 âvaise gane main buraai hi kya he
 Perhaps Shatwari might be impressed by listening to the song, 'gunjan thought
 gujan ne oonche sur main ek lambii taan lee or phir sawan ke maheene main gaae jane vaale ek savanahi geet ko aarambh kiya
 On hearing her tone, Shatwari and Aditi realized that her voice was melodious and her grip on the notes was also good
 geet kii lay par jhumata hua gunjan us geet main aisa dub gaya jaise makrand ke ras main duba koi bhanvara
 Shatwari also began to shake the sound of her ghungroos with her footsteps
 sawan kii bhigi maadak hawa, kheton kii mitti kii sondhi mahak or us par savanahi geet kii madhur lay
 Along with Gunjan, Shatwari and Aditi also flowed into the stream of this song
 geet samaapt hote-hote acharya ji kaa ghar bhi aa gaya
 Wow hum! You sing very well
 or tumhaara swar bhi madhur he
 If you learn classical music, you can become a very big singer
 âshatvari ke swar main aashcharya kam or prasannataa adhik thi
 'you also chuckle, who will teach me classical music to my Shudra?' Gunjan reiterated his compulsion
 âmain sikhaauungi tumhen shastreey sangeet, siikhoge mujhase?â shatvari ne kuch aage jhukate hue kaha or phir apane reshmi baalo main gunthe mogare kii sugandh gunjan kii saanson main mahakaati gaadi se neeche utar ai
 For a few moments Gunjan was immersed in this sweet smell, then suddenly his attention was broken by these words of Shatwari, 'think and answer
 â gunjan ne mud kar dekha, shatvari aditi ke saath acharya ji ke ghar kii ore bad rahi thi
 Gunjan kept looking at his easygoing tricks, something a little enchanted
 aaj tak itani sundar yuvati naa to uske itane sameep ai thi fer or naa hi usase is atmiyata se baat kii thi
 Gunjan started smelling within
 thik vaise hi jaise pehali barish kii buundon se kachi mitti mahak uthati he
 'has Shatwari impressed me? Has she started liking me? The waves started picking up in Gunjan's mind
 lekin phir usne apane man main uthati tarangon ko sambhala
 "is it okay to have such thoughts towards a Brahmin girl while being a Shudra? The mother was also a Brahmin but due to her love marriage to a Shudra father, she had to break ties with her family and had to leave and settle in this village
 ek shudra se ek brahman kanya kaa sambandh samaaj ko kabhi sweekaarya na hoga
 It would be appropriate to curb the flight of mind
 shatvari kaa bhala bhi isi main hoga
 It would be appropriate to politely decline his offer

 Last year, the NIT Srinagar website was hacked three times a month
 is website ko hack karne ke baad massej likhaa gaya tha ki yadi kashmir maangane kii himakat kii to cheer denge
 From this it was estimated that this work was done by the separatists
 narendra modi sarkaar ne aitihaasik kadam uthaate hue jammu-kashmir ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale anuchhed 370 kaa asar khatm kar diya he
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday introduced a historic resolution in the Rajya Sabha, informing the removal of the provisions of Article 370 and the division of the state into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh
 modi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad sawaal uth rahe hai ki kashmir main kya patharbaji ruk jaaegi or algaavvaad kii harkaton par shikanja kasega
 The Modi government has stepped in with pre-planning regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 sarkaar ne pehle aatankwaad par nakel kasne ke liye UAPA sanshodhan bill ko donon sadanon se paas karaayaa
 Subsequently, a large number of security forces were deployed in Jammu and Kashmir
 anuchhed 370 par kadam uthaane se pehle jammu-kashmir ke netaaon ko unke gharon main aadhi raat ko najarband kar diya gaya
 After this, Section 144 was implemented in the entire state
 iske baad sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir ko lekar bade faisle liye
 The difficulties of separatists may increase after the Modi government's decision
 haalanki sarkaar ne pehle hi algaavvaadiyon par nakel kas rakhi thi
 The security of the separatists of Jammu and Kashmir was completely abolished
 badi taadaad main algaavvaadiyon ko jail main daal diya gaya
 Apart from this, by checking the terror funding of the separatists, they had already broken their back
 saath hi kashmir kii jamaat-e-islamic ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kar pratibandh laga diya tha
 LIVE: The Modi government abolished the privileges given to Jammu and Kashmir in 370, the President's approval has tried to completely eliminate the existence of separatists by ending the effect of Section 370 by the Modi government
 jammu-kashmir ko centre shasit rajya ke darja milane ke baad algaavvaadiyon kaa munh uthaanaa mushkil ho jayega
 In such a situation, if they are found to be carrying out activities against the country in some way, then they may have to face tough action under the UAPA Act
 sarkaar ne UAPA kanoon ko kaaphi kadaa bana diya he
 Article 370 related to Kashmir is permanent or temporary? Know the opinion of constitution experts: The special status that Kashmir got after Jammu and Kashmir became a Union Territory is completely over
 aise main baat-baat par ghati main sadakon par utarkar patharbaji karne waalon par nakel kasi ja sakegi
 In fact, now in Jammu and Kashmir, more central government will interfere with the state government
 is tarah se patharbaajon ko raajnneetik sangrakshan bhi kam milegaa
 It is believed that there will be a reduction in stonewalling
 apane jivan ke pehle aath varsh maine haryana ke hisar main bitaye
 i remember, there i would see my parents playing badminton at the Faculty Club of Haryana Agricultural University
 tab main itani choti thi ki mujhe badminton kya, kisi cheez kaa hosh nahin tha
 Later i found that people there are especially indifferent towards girls
 mujhe jab yah bataaya gaya ki meri daadi mere janm lene ke baad ek maheene tak mujhe dekhne nahin ai thim to mujhe aashcharya hua tha
 She was looking forward to the birth of a grandson
 jat parivaar main meraa janm meri ekmaatr bahan ke saat saal baad hua tha
 So, he was very disappointed with my birth
 baharhaal, isamen mere liye ek bahut bada sandesh tha, jise main ab bahut acchhee tarah samajhati hum
 This message was about discrimination against daughters
 saubhaahgya se ham hyderabad chale aae, jahaan kai khelon kaa vikaas duusare kai rajyon ke mukaable kaaphi hua he
 It helped me to make my career successfully
 mujhe 14 saal kii umr main hi bharat petroleum or ab deccan chronical jaise hdhaayojak mili
 We live in an apartment that has been bought with the prize money i have received
 mere mata-pita ne ise mere naam se kharida he
 Many Haryanvi players, especially women, are not as lucky
 unhen shandaar pradarshan karne ke baavjood praayojak nahin milte
 In the last two years, the Haryana government has given many incentives to the players
 dilli rashtramandal khelon main padak jeetne waalon ke liye ab tak kii adhiktam puraskaar raashi or car bhi
 No other state government has made such an offer so far
 haryana sarkaar kii yah peshkash swaagatyogy he
 They are all very close to me as most of them are Jats
 kuch ne to mujhase yah tak kaha ki bacchiyon ke prati paaramparik soch or ladakiyon ke prati khap panchayaton ke vyavhaar ke maddenjar maatr 20 varsh kii umr main unke liye ek preranastrot hum
 Due to the encouragement received from their parents and employer - Haryana Police - these women players have performed so boldly
 unhen khaas tarah kaa kaam diya jaataa he or pehle ke mukaable ab unki behatar dekhbhaal kii jaati he
 In rural Haryana, it is dominated by men and its effect is also seen on sports
 lekin is baat se jarur fark padegaa ki rajya main aae 29 padakon main se adhiktar mahila khilaadiyon ne jite hai
 Parents should work more intelligently and with an open mind
 mere taaoo or rishtedaar ladakiyon ko khelon ke liye to kya, kisi cheez ke liye ghar se baahar nikalne dene ke paksh main nahin hai
 i hardly have any conversation with him
 mere mata-pita zyada khule vichaaron ke hai
 They have encouraged me a lot
 meri bahan ne apni pasand se shaadi kii, jise unhone maan liya
 If there is more support and encouragement from parents then more girls will move out and their lives will improve
 ladakiyon ko apane adhikaar ladakar lene honge
 We can start well by taking more opportunities in sports
 zyada hdhaayojakon ko bhi aage aane kii jarurat he
 This will be possible only with the better performance of the players
 meri khwaahish to yah he ki haryana main racket se khele jane vaale khelon ko zyada lokahdhi banaaya jaae kyonki inamen kariyar lanbaa hota he
 This will also improve the situation of women there
 rajya sarkaar badminton or tennis jaise in khelon ke liye vahaan academy kii sthapana karke shuruyaat kar sakati he
 i am emphasizing on sports because the doors of opportunity open up for those who work in them
 iske liye rojaanaa nau-das ghante kaa kadaa prashikshan chahie
 It demands considerable manual labor
 khilaadiyon ko maansik taur par bhi kaaphi majboot bananaa hoga, khaskar ladakiyon ko kyonki aam taur par unamem yah kamajori hoti he
 For this, formal education will have to be abandoned
 khel or shiksha, donon saath-saath chalaanaa mushkil hota he
 No matter what happens if we try both of them, we cannot in any way compare a powerful player like Serena Williams 
 ham ladakiyon ko kai khelon main vishwa kaa number van bananaa hoga
 This is not an impossible thing
 yah keval apane dimag ko taiyaar karne kii baat he
 My com has shown us the way with our commitment
 agar saat-aath kii umr main hi pratibhaaon ko chun liya jaae to ham ladakiyon ko 18-20 kii umr tak vishwa champion bana sakate hai
 We can certainly succeed
 cyna nehwal vishwa kii number do mahila badminton khilaadi hai The biggest boast is scheduled to begin on the field next month
 bharat apane pehle mukaable main pakistan se bhidega
 When the teams of India and Pakistan take the field, the situation looks like a war
 khilaadi duniya kii kisi team se bhale haar jaaen, lekin ek-duusare se haarana unhen manjuur nahin hota
 Like every time Pakistan's team is talking about making new history this time too
 bharat chaahe toornament ke hisaab se khud ko taiyaar karne kii baat kah rahaa ho, purv captain pakistan younus khan kehete hai ki itihaas ko badalane kaa mauka he or is baar mujhe It seems that Pakistan can beat India in the World Cup this time
 world cap main bharat ke khilaaf pakistan kaa record behad kharaab he
 Pakistan have not been able to beat India in any World Cup match
 isaki tis pakistan team main jarur barkaraar lagati he
 There have been 10 World Cups between 1975 and 2011
 in 10 world cap main paanch baar ye timen aapas main bhidi hai or har baar bharat ko jeet mili he
 The challenge against India for Pakistan seems more difficult this time due to many other reasons
 team india geffending champion he or chote formet main pakistan se kahin zyaada majboot nazar aati he
 Also, his deadly spinner Saeed Ajmal is not in the World Cup due to the ban, while fast bowler Umar Gul is not in the team due to injury
 2011 world cap ke baad ke aankade zarur barabari ke rahe hai
 After the 2011 World Cup, there have been six one-day matches between the two teams, in which India won three, while Pakistan also won three times
 world cap main bharat or pakistan kaa pehla match ek-duusare ke kilaaf hai, jisaki tikaten jari hote hi bik gayi isliye samajha ja saktaa he ki fans kii dilchaspee is match main toornament ke duusare maichon se kahin zyaada he

 hamane is maamle main deshbhar main adwijuri jari kar di he or apane str par kaam shuru kar diya he
 He further said that we are also telling people that dust should be removed at least
 hamane rajya sarkaron se kaha he ki is sambandh main jaruri disha-nirdesh jari kiye jaaen
 Construction on the buildings under construction should be stopped immediately, so that less dust can be removed and this situation can be controlled
 kendriya paryaavaran mantri dow harshavardhan kaa kahana he ki hamaari taraf se to ection main kisi tarah kii koi kami nahin barti ja rahi he
 Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal also held a meeting in this regard and took several decisions to improve the environment
 unhone is paristhiti main dilli sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki ek ore dilli ke log dhul ke kaaran itane takalif main hai, yahaan ection honi chahie, sarkaar ko sthiti par najar banaae rakhni chahie thi tomukhyamantriapane mantriyon ke saath air condishan kamaron main lete hue hai or kah rahe hai ki ham dharna kar rahe hai
 When he did nothing after three-four years
 aap logon kii aankh main aap ek to vaise dhul jhonk rahi thi
 This environmental dust has come from above
 isko bachaane ke liye bhi kuch dhyaan nahin de rahe
 This is very unfortunate
 pradooshan ke str ke thik hone ke bare main harshavardhan kaa kahana ki jo centre sarkaar kar sakati hai wo kar rahi he
 The Meteorological Department says that it will be all right in the next two-three days
 unhone kaha ki sthiti ko sahi karne ke liye nirmaankarya ko rokna hoga, saath hi jahaan-jahaan dhul he uske upar pani kaa chhidkaav karnaa hoga
 According to the Meteorological Department, the weather department has increased the amount of fine particles in the atmosphere due to dusty hot winds running for the last 2 days
 anumaan he ki 15 june kii shaam se dilli samet uttar-pashchim bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main dhul kii maatra garmi shuru ho jaaegi
 This will be because storm water activity will increase in northwest India
 mausam vibhagake nideshak kuldeep shrivastav ke mutabik rajasthan se aa rahi dhul bhari hawaaen jameen kii sataha se dhai kilometre oonchai tak ja rahi he
 The speed of these winds is 35 km per hour
 rajasthan se chalakar hawaaen jab dilli ke paas pahunch rahi hai to yahaan par anti cychlonic sarkulation ke chalate pashchim uttar pradesh kii taraf nahin mud rahi he
 Due to this, the amount of dust is collecting more over Delhi NCR
 kuldeep kaa kahana he ki agle 24 ghante main koi khaas badlaav nahin hone ja rahaa he, lekin 15 june kii shaam se rajasthan se aa rahi dhul bhari hawaaon kii raftaar thodaa kam padegi jisase dilli-ensiaar samet tamaam ilaakon main aa rahi dhul kii maatra kam ho jaaegi
 The activity of Thunder Storm is expected to begin in Uttarakhand and its adjoining areas on 16th, it will directly affect the dusty winds in North West India
 lihaaja yahi ummid he 16 se dilli, punjab, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh main dhul bhari hawaaon kaa kahar kaaphi had tak kam ho jayega
