 For this reason, Sehwag named his inning as 'pakistan's ghost made day'
 news channelon ke banaae hue darshakon kii duniya main jab logon ko samasya hoti he to un logon kaa naam darshakon ke bahikhaate se kaat diya jaataa he
 You will see that the whole debate is revolving around the leaders of the two parties and the voice of the people is not reaching anyone
 aaj aap in logon main nahin hai lekin jab bhi aap apni samasya lekar log banenge yani sadak par aaenge, media ko khojenge to aapke liye koi nahin aayega
 It is also your job to notice what has changed
 ravivaar ko dilli main kai pradarshan hue
 People kept searching the media in those demonstrations
 ghar jaakar channelon par khud ko khojate rahe
 Hope the public has seen the condition of the public
 jantar mantar yaa ramlila maidan par logon kaa aana ab kisi ke liye khabar nahin he magar khabar ye he ki log phir bhi aa rahe hai
 Not for the channels but to keep the public coming on the streets
 3 march ko jantar mantar par noujvaan bharat sabha, bigul mazdoor dasta ne bhi is pradarshan main hissaa liya
 Bhagat Singh demanded to pass the Employment Guarantee Act
 khaali pade sarkari padon ko jaldi bharne kii maang kii gai
 There was a voice to end the contractual job practice
 anganwari varkar or helper ke bachche or parivaar ke sadsy bhi yahaan maujuud the
 In September last year, the Prime Minister announced that the honorarium paid to Anganwadi workers will be increased from 3000 to 4500 and that of Helper will be increased from 1500 to 2250 rupees
 kaha gaya tha ki aktubar se badha hua paisa milegaa
 At that time, the Prime Minister had talked to Anganwadi and Asha Worker through video conferencing, said that 4 lakh insurance will be provided
 aktubar main nahin mila, november main nahin mila, disambar main nahin mila, janvari main nahin mila, farvari main nahin mila
 Announcements are made in the budget in February
 dilli state anganwari workars and helpers association kii shivani kaul ne kaha ki sitambar 2018 kii ghoshnaa or bajet main kii gai ghoshnaa ek hi he jo aaj tak nahin mili
 The same thing was announced twice
 abhi tak ek nayaa paisa inke khate main nahin aayaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces on September 18, 2018 that Anganwadi workers and Asha workers will get the increased money from October 1
 diwali se pehle paisa aa jayega
 Then what was the announcement made by the Finance Minister in the budget of 1 February
 dilli state anganwari workars and helpers association kii shivani kaul ne jab yah baat bataai to hamen bhi yakeen nahin hua ki jisaki ghoshnaa sitambar main pradhanmantri kar chuke hai uski dobaaraa ghoshnaa bajet main hoti he
 Anganwadi workers and helper work is very important
 inaki uplabdhiyon ko sarkaar or sarkarein apane liye bhunaa leti hai magar inke kaam ko kabhi manyata nahin deteen
 Work less than minimum wage
 dilli main hi 11000 ke kareeb anganwari centre hai
 In these centers, in addition to basic training to the poor children, such a diet is given to them so that there is a reduction in malnutrition in children between 0 and 6 years
 swasthya behatar ho
 Cooked food is also available and registries are also given to take home
 iske alaava polio se lekar kai prakaar ke tikaakaran abhiyaan bhi inhen anganwari workaron ke zarie hota he
 But everything is contracted and forced
 hamane aapako dilli ke kuch anganvadi centaron kii tasviren dikhaai taaki aapako andaaza ho sake ki inkaa kaam kya he or kitna zaruri he
 An Anganwadi worker in Delhi city gets around 10,000
 reporter vagairah aplod karne ke liye internet kaa 500 dene kii baat thi magar inhen nahin miltaa he
 The central government's share in this 10,000 is a mere 1500
 pradarshan main maang kii gai ki 1975 se samekit bal vikaas yojana se hazaron mahila workaron ko hataane ke liye sidhe paisa dene kii yojana laai ja rahi he
 Shivani Kaul says that this is permanent work
 dilli ke padosi rajya haryana main 8 farvari se 50,000 anganwari varkar pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said that he would give 11,400 but till today he did not get that money
 ise lekar kai zilon main pradarshan chal rahe hai
 Everywhere Anganwadi workers demand that they get permanent employee recognition and honorable money in place of contract
 chunaav ke maukey par janata ke mudde gaayab hai, netaa apni taraf se janata ko mudde thama rahe hai
 Think of yourself that in 10,000 a city like Delhi will be passed
 kuch nahin kii jagah kuch to dene or milane ke naam par in mahilaon kaa jamaane tak shoshan hua
 If our colleague Sushil Mahapatra had not gone to Jantar Mantar on Sunday, all this would not have been known
 jantar mantar or ramlila maidan main mazaduron ke adhikaar ko lekar raily hui
 English newspapers are applauded when the government changes the workers' law
 magar mazdoor un badlaavon ko kaise dekhtaa he yaa un badlaavon ke kaaran us par kya bitati he, ham nahin jaan pate
 There was a march of workers from Ramlila Maidan to Jantar Mantar
 is march main mazudaron ke adhikaar ke liye ladane vaale trade union centre aaf karnataka, odisha, bhel majdoor trade union or mazdoor adhikaar sangharsh abhiyaan masa sahit kai sanghathanon kii taraf se ye march niklaa
 Permanent jobs are being abolished by changing laws and contract jobs are being promoted
 mazaduron ko 8 se 10,000 se zyaada paise nahin mil pate hai
 They demand that a minimum wage of Rs 25,000 be made
 union banane ke adhikaar ko manyata mili
 Contract jobs should not be promoted
 mazdoor bhi naagarik hai
 There are citizens from Anganwadi workers to farmers but have been excluded from the electoral discussion
 3 march ko dilli ke jantar mantar par ardh sainik bal bhi aae the apni maangon ko lekar
 For which the channels are running aggressive programs of patriotism
 vahaan sawaalon par hamale ho rahe hai ki aisa poochne se ardhsainik balon kaa manobal gir jayega lekin jab ardhsainik bal apane sawaalon ko lekar jantar mantar par aae to unka manobal badhaane koun sa media gaya aap puch sakate hai
 On 24 February and 3 March, there were two demonstrations of paramilitary forces which were covered by Sushil Mahapatra and Rajiv Ranjan
 seva nivrutt ho chuke ardhsainik balon ke purv jawan or adhikari apni maangon ko lekar pradarshan karte hai magar sunwaayee nahin hoti he
 The media did not have time for large number of paramilitary forces
 inaki maang he ki 2004 ke baad se jo pension band hui he use phir se chaalu kiya jaae
 Like the army, they also received one rank one pension
 kathin halaat main tainaat javaanon ko vishesh ardhsainik bhatta mili
 Among the leaders who encouraged him, only Jayant Chaudhary, who is the leader of the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 inkaa kahana he ki pulavama maamle ko raajnneetik dal apane liye bhunaa rahe hai magar unki maang par koi dhyaan nahin detaa he
 The paramilitary forces demand that all states should have the same compensation so that there is no discrimination against the CRPF and other paramilitary forces
 24 farvari ke pradarshan main bhi jawan se lekar afasar sab shaamil the
 The performance was covered by Sushil Mahapatra
 inaki maang he ki har zile main sainik board kii tarah ardh sainik board hona chahie taaki javaanon ko har kaam ke liye dilli nahin aana pade
 The sentiment being created on channels for paramilitary forces, what is being done through politics is less for these forces, more for those forces called votes
 ab ek nae naare kii baat
 Neither Lok Sabha nor Vidhan Sabha, Largest Gram Sabha
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar yahi laga ki ham dibet ke chakkar main desh kaa kitna kuch dekhne se rah jate hai
 On March 2, the rally came out from the hills of Bailadila in Dantewada and the padyatra lasted for 15 km
 dilli main vijay raily ke naam par bike par savaar 500 logon kii raily cover ho jaati he magar aap khud sochie ki tivi kis tarah se janata ke bich se janata ko gaayab kar detaa he
 In this rally, gram sabha is being described as bigger than Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha
 kyonki inke netaaon kaa aarope he ki 2014 main ek gaanv main farji tareeke se gram sabha bulaakar adani enterprize ko lohe kaa khadaan de diya gaya
 We have tried to contact Adani Enterprise
 paksh milegaa to zarur dikhaaenge magar yah maamla zila prashasan kaa he
 If a fake gram sabha has taken place, it has to be proved by the district administration itself with the help of panchayat officials
 agar gram sabhaayen bhi farji tareeke se hui hai to isaki gambhir jaanch honi chahie
 Aboriginal people from 20 villages participated in this padyatra
 centre kii sanstha neshnal mineral deveopment karoporation or chhattisgarh mineral deveopment karporation ke siio prabhakar raav se is bare main poocha kyonki isi joint venture ko gram sabha kii anumati ke baad khadaan kii leez mili he
 It was then transferred to the Adani Group
 siaio prabhakar raav ne is pradarshan ke baad dantewada ke colector ko patr likhaa he ki is aarope kii jaanch karen
 He also said that when there was talk of calling a fake gram sabha in 2014, then why did not the complaint come
 is march kaa yahi ek makasad nahin tha
 In this, both the Center and the state government have been warned that according to the Forest Land Act 2006, their right to the forest land should be ensured
 is raily main ken or rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf naare lage
 Warned that the state government should not ignore the gram sabha
 hamaare sahyogi somesh patel ne van mantri mohammad akbar se poocha to unhone kaha ki maamle kii puri jaankaree nahin he ham pataa karenge
 How much is happening in the country
 tivi main sirf do chaar baaten hi ho rahi hai
 In the Indian Express of March 4, Ashok Gulati and Ranjana Roy wrote that the Modi government's performance in the last four governments has been average in the agriculture sector
 2022 se 23 tak kisaanon kii aamadani dugani kerani he to kheton ko teen saal tak 10 pratishat kii dar se vikaas karnaa hoga
 But the growth rate is 2
 9 pratishat
 Accordingly, in the next four years, the growth rate of 15 percent in agriculture is needed, then the income will double
 jo ki asambhav he
 If it comes to the Prime Minister, then there is one more thing
 unhone dislexia ko lekar jo raajnneetik mazaaq kiya he wo acha nahin tha
 This is a disease that slows down the ability to read and write
 pratibha main koi kami nahin hoti he
 You must have seen the film on Taare Zami
 kisi kii kamazori kaa yaa kisi beemaari kaa mazaaq nahin udaaya jaataa he
 Not much is told to the Prime Minister
 aap dekhie unhone kya kiya
 Guess who they are mocking
 aapako bataa den ki kai bade-bade vaigyanik dislexia se jujhate rahe hai
 Just three names - Albert Einstein, Thomas Alva Edison and Graham Bell
 hruthik roshan or abhishek bachchan jaise sitare dislexia se guzare hai
 Clearly, the difficulty of identifying the words proved to be a minor obstacle ahead of his talent
 lekin jo log har sawaal ko apni raajnneeti se jodne ke aadi hon, unako kis beemaari kii peedit mana jaae

 At the same time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is keeping a close watch on the issue regarding the congress-jds coalition government in Karnataka
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri divi sadanand gauda ne kaha ki vidhayakon ko lagata he ki congress-jedies se baahar aane kaa yah behatar mauka he

 uttar pradesh chunaav main bhi bihar kii tarj par mahagathbandhan banane ke prayaas ko bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne khaarij kar diya he
 Modi said that a grand alliance like Bihar cannot be formed in Uttar Pradesh and because of this there is a strong opposition from Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Bahujan Samajwadi Party supremo Mayawati
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par tanj kasate hue modi ne kaha ki mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati donon main se koi bhi nitish kumaar kii tarah chunaav jeetne ke liye apane dhur virdohi ke pairon main nahin girane vaala he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar had said on Wednesday that in Uttar Pradesh too, the grand alliance formula can be successful if both Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party come together
 susheel modi ne kaha ki 'lakhon muslim auraton kaa utpeedan karne vaali teen talaak pratha par chuppi saadhane or aatankiyon ke maare jane par chaati peetane vaale nitish kumaar ko upi main koi nahin puch rahaa he
 The grand alliance cannot be there because neither Mulayam or Mayawati are going to fall on the feet of their rival leader like Nitish
 'modi ne lalu par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha argedy mukhiya ne mahagathbandhan sarkaar main shahabuddin se nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bayaan dilwakar mahagathbandhan main aag lagane kaa kaam kiya he
 In a tweet, Sushil Modi wrote that if the two major parties in the Grand Alliance government, the Janata Dal United and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, are all right, then why Lalu Yadav has to repeatedly trust that the government of the Grand Alliance is full 5 Will the year go on? Modi said that if everything is alright in the Grand Alliance government, then why is there a need to issue bulletins daily on the tenure of the government
 kya vaaki duniya third world war yani tisare vishwa yuddh kii taraf bad rahi he? agar haa, to kyon or kaise? aakhir koun karne vaala he is tisare vishwa yuddh kii shuruyaat? kahin aisa to nahin ki parmaanu bamon se las is duniya kaa vajood hi is vishwa yuddh kii vajah se khatm ho jaae? duniya ke do newclear power desh north korea or america jis tarah se parmaanu bam kaa batan dabaane kii dhamkee de rahe hai, usne is khatre ko or bhi badha diya he
 The alarm of the missile attack in America was suppressed
 hawaii kii seemaa ke paas belistic missile se hamale kaa khatra tha
 Emergency alert reached officers' phone
 darasal, immergency alarm kaa batan galati se dabaa to america ko kim jong un kii dhamkee yaad aa gai
 Because Kim threatened her to press the nuclear button
 dhamkee kaa jawaab dhamkee sekim kaha tha 'meri teble par parmaanu bam kaa batan he, kabhi bhi dabaa duungaa
 On the other hand, President Trump of America had said to him, 'I have a bigger button than you and it works too
 ' ek apni teble par parmaanu bam kaa batan hone kii dhamkee de rahaa he, to doosraa kah rahaa he ki mere paas tumse bhi bada batan he or ye kaam bhi karata he
 Now when the world's two nuclear-powered countries and their leaders talk in this manner, fear is bound to happen
 yahi vajah he ki duusare vishwayuddh se lekar ab tak duniya ne beshak tarakkee ke tamaam paaydaan chhu liye hon, lekintisare vishwayuddh kii aahatse use ab bhi dar lagata he
 America and North Korea will become the reasons for the third world war, there are many reasons for the danger of the third world war hovering over the world
 lekin in vajahon main sabase upar he america or uttar korea kaa rishta
 In North Korea these days, dictator Kim Jong Un is ruled by him, who is said to be extremely hot-hearted, soulless and heartless
 kuch itnaa ki use jisase bhi apni kursi par khatra mahasoos hota he, wo uski jaan lene main zaraa bhi der nahin karata, phir chaahe wo uskaa apana hi koon kyon naa ho? aise main america ek taanashaah ke haathon main parmaanu bamon kaa batan hone ko duniya kaa sabase bada khatra maanata he or har haal main uttar korea se uski parmaanu taaqat chhinana or khatm karnaa chahta he
 Atomic bomb for security, on the other hand, North Korea not only considers America as its biggest enemy, but also says that all of North Korea's weapons are for its own security
 apane vajood ke liye wo america ko bhi apane parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa nishaanaa banane se peeche nahin hatega
 Moreover, North Korea has been conducting rapid nuclear tests despite international restrictions and UN sanctions
 aise main do newclear power kii ye aapasi tanatani hi tisare vishwayuddh kii sabase badi vajah he
 North Korea's enmity with neighboring countries, but it is not just about bad relations between these two countries

 Indian wing commander Abhinandan is returning to his homeland today, nearly 56 hours after his detention in Pakistan
 unke desh vaapasi kaa puraa desh intjaar kar rahaa he
 At the same time, there is a lot of enthusiasm and enthusiasm among the people who have come to welcome them at the Wagah border
 pakistani kabje main jane ke 56 ghante baad abhinandan ko pakistan ne lautaaya or ab hamaara vir sapoot hamaare bich he
 But this is the victory of the valor of India's heroic son and the strength and might of India
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kaise bharat ne sakht rukh or kootnithik daanv se sirf 56 ghante main is mushkil mishan ko puraa kiya
 On February 14 in Pulwama, there was a terrorist attack, our air force penetrated 100 kilometers inside Pakistan on February 26 and wreaked havoc on the terrorist bases of Balakot and pok in Pakistan
 bhartiya ection se baukhalaayaa pakistan jawaab dene ke liye agle hi din bharat main ghus aayaa
 This is how the PAK plane was destroyed
 On 27 February, the Pakistani aircraft F16, which entered the Indian border around 10 am, greeted the Pakistani riders in the sky with their mighty sixes
 jabanj payalat ne puraane mig vimaan MIG 21 bysan se hi F16 ko khaded diya
 F16 debris was found in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 wing commander abhinandan ko apana celut, sandesh yahaan post karenasman main hue is jang kii chapet main wing commander abhinandan kaa mig-21 bysan bhi aayaa
 Actually, anything could happen in the mig-21 Bison, chasing the enemies
 aise main wing commander abhinandan se parachute se chalaang laga di or jab ve jameen par pahunche ve ilaaka pioke kaa tha
 Abhinandan also showed indomitable courage by going into the enemy's possession to kill the heavily-armed Pakistan's enemy plane
 jab unka vimaan gira to us vakt bhi unhone apana parakram dikhaakar pakistaniyon ko hairaan kar diya
 According to a report by Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Abhinandan jumped from a parachute in a pond and tried to swallow some documents and maps
 abhinandan ne vahaan jamaa hue logon se poocha ki vah bharat main hai yaa pakistan main? jiske jawaab main ek bachche ne chaalaaki dikhaate hue kaha ki vah bharat main hi hai
 The pilot then raised slogans and asked where he was in India
 usee ladke ne abhinandan ko bataaya ki vah kila main hai
 The patriotic slogans of Abhinandan could not be digested by some Pakistani youth and the slogan of Pakistan Army Zindabad
 abhinandan samaj gaye ki vah pakistan main hai lekin bina dare unhone hawa main firing kii
 The Indian pilot fired into the air to scare people with stones in his hands
 is mushkil paristhiti main bhi abhinandan ne saahas banaae rakhaa or pakistan ke aam nagarikon kii suraksha kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa
 He jumped into a pond and tried to destroy them by taking out some documents from his pocket, so that nothing could come to the Pakistani army
 iske baad pakistan ne ek video jari kiya jisamen unase sena kaa afasar koi sawaal puch rahaa tha or ve jawaab dene se saaf manaa kar rahe the
 Despite being in captivity by the enemy, the courage to greet the Indian pilot does not seem to stagger at all
 abhinandan ke pita bhi vayusena main apni sevaayen de chuke hai
 Wing Commander Abhinandan Sina Tane, also in the possession of the Pakistani Army, stood up and refused to answer any questions
 puure desh main abhinandan kii vaapasi kii duaen hone lagi or bharat sarkaar ne saaf kar diya ki pakistan ko hamaare payalat ko bini kisi shart, bina nuksaan pahunchaaen saunpna hi hoga
 On the way, the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and attacked the largest terrorist factory of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot
 pioke main duusare aatanki campon ko nestnabut kiya
 Pakistan was horrified by that
 pakistan ko dar tha ki bharat apane payalat abhinandan ko chhudaane ke liye koi bada faisla kar saktaa he
 Islamabad had its eyes on every movement in Delhi
 pulavama aatmghaatee hamale ke baad puraa hindustan gusse main tha
 Pakistan had already seen the surgical strike of the Indian army after the Uri attack
 rawalpindi main baithe pakistani army ke generalon kii bhi samaj main aa gaya ki ye nayaa bharat he- jo dushman ke ghar main bhi ghus saktaa he or maar bhi saktaa he
 On the one hand, the Indian army is leaving no stone unturned to teach Pakistan a lesson, on the other hand the whole world is with India in the war against terrorism
 america raashtrapati donald trump pehle hi sanket de chuke the ki koi acchhee khabar aanevaali he
 The superpowers of the world were also engaged in bashing Pakistan and were seen standing with the action of Indian Air Force on terrorist bases in Pakistan
 aise main pakistan ke paas khud ko shanti doot dikhaane ke sivaae koi doosraa chaara nahin bachaa
 Exposing Pakistan, India told most of the countries of the world that who closed their airspace? Who closed Samjhauta Express? India will not tolerate more terrorist attacks on its soil? Pakistan's war will be fully combated? Meanwhile, India has sent a dossier to Pakistan with all the evidence about the Pulwama terror attack being linked to Pakistan
 matlab, bharat ne pakistan ko puri tarah gher liya
 This was the Lakshman Rekha drawn from India
 iskaa matlab tha ki agar hamaara payalat surakshit nahin lautaa to pakistan ke khilaaf sidhi karrwai hogi
 Pakistan understood the anger of India and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan himself had to declare within 30 hours to return India's heroic accolades
 haalanki, payalat abhinandan ko chhodane se pehle pakistan ne bahut hisaab-kitaab kiya
 Abhinandan wanted to write a bargain script further
 lekin, koi daanv kaam nahin aayaa
 India has clearly stated that it will not enter any language of Islamabad
 aaj hindustan apane shoorveer payalat kaa abhinandan kar rahaa he jo pakistan kii aabhohawaa dekhakar aa rahaa he, lekin bharat kaa rukh saaf he ki pulavama cond kaa mastermind masood ajahar bahut dinon tak aaazaad nahin gum saktaa he

 This program is about 1 hour long
 28 oktober yani shanivaar ko subah 11 baje bijepi headquarter 11 ashok road ke saath vaale bangala number 9 main diwali milan kaa ek kaarykram rakhaa gaya he
 The DMK has decided to fight a legal battle for Kanimozhi trapped in the 2-G case
 chennai main buudhvaar ko is baavat party kii hai level meeting hui
 This meeting of the party was extremely important after DMK chief Karunanidhi's daughter and MP Kanimozhi's name got into the 2G scam
 darasal pehali baar diemke pramukh karunanidhi ke parivaar ke kisi sadsy par chargeshit daakhil kii gai he, jise lekar party kaaphi naaraaz he, lekin is baithak main congress ke saath rishte ko lekar philhal koi faisla nahin liya gaya he
 The dmk's party proposal states that the 2G spectrum issue is being used to discredit the party
 baithak ke baad karunanidhi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ham sachai ko sabit karne ke liye kanoonee kadam uthaaenge
 There was speculation that the DMK might take some drastic measures and decide to leave the Union Cabinet after Kanimozhi's name was included in the cbi's supplementary charge sheet in a Delhi court on Monday
 Can
 yah puche jane par ki kya kanimojhi 6 may ko dilli main sibiai kii ek adaalat main pesh hogi, karunanidhi ne iskaa sakaaratmak jawaab diya
 This court has summoned Kanimozhi
 unhone kaha, vah (kanimojhi) jayalalita nahin hai, jo adaalat ke saman kii andekhi kar de
 Karunanidhi said this while referring to the demand for exemption from AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa's personal appearance in a Bangalore court in a disproportionate assets case
 yah puche jane par ki kya kanimojhi or kalenganor tivi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari sarat kumaar agrim jamaanat kii maang karenge, karunanidhi ne kaha ki is bare main vakil faisla karenge
 Significantly, the court has also summoned Kumar
 karunanidhi ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki unki party is mudde par kisi pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karegi
 a proposal was also accepted in this meeting, stating that some parties want to create a lack of confidence in the UPA allies and break the alliance
 isamen kaha gaya he ki 2ji maamle kaa istemaal diemke ko apamaanit karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 The inclusion of Kanimozhi's name in the supplementary charge sheet has also surprised the proposal
 (input bhashaa se bhi) This is the photocall of politics
 netaa ke liye har lamhaa ek photo he
 Photo love of politicians is not new
 bharat kaa har shahar netaaon ke photo se bharaa he
 On posters, he is seen giving greetings and messages like an angel
 in postaron main bhi badlaav ho rahaa he
 Previously passport size photos were taxed heavily, now the photo of the leader has started becoming a part of the posters while citing, calling or marching on foot
 2012 ke saal ke baad se raajnneeti main photo kaa istemaal badal gaya he
 It has changed so much that now it is becoming difficult to see beyond the photo
 gaur se dekhenge ki aapke raajnneetik chintan ke spes ko photo se bhar diya gaya he
 In the morning, the photo starts coming on Twitter
 kisase mil rahe hai, kya pahan rahe hai or kise kya de rahe hai
 Every meeting is being converted into a photo and is being made a part of propaganda and publicity
 virdohi ke photo kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he or apni party ke netaa ke photo kaa prachaar kiya jaataa he
 What happened in that meeting, after that the result is less, but the photo comes
 meraa jivan hi meraa sandesh he
 This statement of Gandhi should be changed today, my photo is my message
 photo ko lekar raajnneetik pratiyogita chal padi he
 Whenever the image of a leader or officer is bad or he gets into controversies, he appears on a photo spot the very next day
 train main safar karne lagata he to kisi garib se milane lagata he
 When someone starts tweeting after meeting a widow, then someone offers a photo of it on the timeline before offering the sheet
 kai baar lagata he ki netaa ek din surakshakarmi chhod do chaar photo vaale ko lekar chalane lagenge
 Moving but the photo has now become the new weapon of democratic political security
 train main baithe hai uskaa photo, train se utar kar kahaan ja rahe hai uskaa photo
 There is a comparison between this photo and that photo on social media
 dekho ve khaali dibbe main akele ja rahe hai, dekho ye bhari hui bogi main sabake saath ja rahe hai
 Notifications are getting shorter
 sawaalon ke jawaab kam mil rahe hai
 Just send photos
 kaam hua iskaa photo nahin he magar kaam karte hue dikhte rahane kaa photo he
 If you question that the work is not being done, then the next day, some leader comes to get the photo taken
 raajnneetik vyakti ko zarur prachaar karnaa chahie or apane kaam ke bare main bataanaa chahie magar kai baar lagata he ki yah ati ho rahaa he
 Is millions of metric photo garbage being generated every day on Twitter and Facebook
 koi chhavi zyada der tak nahin tikti he
 When you are delighted with one photo, another photo comes that you were being unnecessarily happy
 ye photo dekhiye
 See the tweets of any government head or spokesperson
 soochna kam he, photo zyada he
 The Air Force abounds with pictures of goods and people disembarking
 aisa lagata he ki ye saare photo ke liye hi bitha kar laae ja rahe hai
 Not once, such pictures are being tweeted
 yaman se lekar nepal tak ke saraahneey kaam ko photo-karm main badal diya he
 Surely this has changed the perception and also the name of the country, but is image the only information of these efforts
 aap aisi kitni tasviren dekh sakate hai
 It seems that the entire operation is going on in the inner grounds of the giant ships
 aapadaa yaa madad ke aaparishan kitni jaankariyon or sabak se bhare hote hai magar wo sab ab gaayab he
 Lyricist and writer Nilesh Misra found it right that India is proud that India is taking the initiative but the display of pictures of the moment is knocking something out
 madad kii apni ek garima hoti he lekin prachaar kii bhi ek seemaa honi chahie
 If service is our religion, it is also an Indian philosophy to help someone or give something to someone, then don't tell everyone
 sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ko ek santulan kaayam karnaa chahie
 Selfless service should not be converted into publicity service
 kai rajya sarkaron ne bhi in maukon ko photo yogya saraahneey kaary main badalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Why are different state governments jumping when the central government is doing it? nepal se kai log bataa rahe hai ki yahaan madad ke naam aa rahe hai
 Going to take a photo yahi haal swanyasevi sansthaaon kaa bhi ho gaya he
 Every aid is being converted into a number and each number is being added to a thousand
 sankhya is photo yuddh main ek nayaa hathiyaar he
 Every leader has time for selfies and photos
 aam aadmi se pucho to rota milegaa ki phalane netaa ko i-mail bhi kiya, ghar bhi gaye par mulaakaat nahin hui
 The work was not done but the photo of the meeting was tweeted
 tippaniyan a similar competition has taken place in the opposition
 ek formula sa ban gaya he ki ek acha photo kisi ko acha netaa bana saktaa he
 Ideological discourses are being produced less often
 photo sangharsh zyada ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is on a journey
 ek tarah se photo-yatra par hai
 There is a picture of every moment
 satta paksh photo-paksh ho gai he to virdohi bhi photo-paksh ho gaya he
 The answer to the photo is the photo
 jahaaz se lekar train main bacchon ke saath nazar aa rahe hai
 Just as the Prime Minister stops and takes selfies or starts pulling
 aam aadmi party kii chhavi par sawaal uthte hai to achaanak agle din se nae nae tarah ke jansampark ke photo aane lagate hai
 The government and opponents are doing the same thing
 mantri ji phalane mohalle main logon kii baaten sunate hue is tarah ke sheershak ke saath photo twit hota he
 What was the problem and what was the solution or not or what was the new thing that they had to leave the office to know, all this is not part of our information
 bas ek photo he
 Democracy has been transformed into choreocracy
 har chiz croriographd he
 That is why i say that this is not democracy
 ab ye koreokrasi ho gai he
 Democracy is punished in a stadium
 netaa ke aane se pehle kai dinon kii taiyaari chalati he
 The themes are designed and broadcast on TV
 ek dam dance india dance kii tarah
 Every moment photo is taken and tweeted
 party se lekar vyaktigat netaaon ne ab apane yahaan aisi team banani shuru kar di he jo unke har kaam ko photo main badal de
 The social media teams that are being made here at the leaders are now doing the work that companies do to prepare the event on the wedding or the last days of the year
 padayatra ho yaa stadium main logon kaa sambodhan sab is tarah se sajaayaa ja rahaa he taaki iskaa har frem ek nayaa photo de jaae
 Welcome to choreocracy
 ham sab selfi jaagruk naagarik ban rahe hai
 The use of photos in politics has changed since the year of 2012
 itnaa badal gaya he ki ab photo ke paar jaakar dekh paanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 It will be seen carefully that the space of your political thought has been filled with photos
 subah subah twitor par photo kaa aana chaalu ho jaataa he
 Who are they meeting, what are they wearing and whom are they giving
 har mulaakaat ko ek photo main tabdeel kar use prapanch or prachaar kaa hissaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The photo of the opponent is mocked and the photo of the leader of his party is promoted
 us mulaakaat main kya hua, uske baad kya nateeja niklaa isaki jaankaree kam hoti he lekin photo aa jaataa he
 My life is my message
 gandhi ke is kathan ko aaj badal kar meraa photo hi meraa sandesh he kar diya janaa chahie
 Political competition has started on the photo
 jab bhi kisi netaa yaa ohadedaar kii chhavi karaab hoti he yaa wo vivaadon main aata he, wo agle hi din kisi photo spot par nazar aa jaataa he
 When he starts traveling in a train, he starts meeting someone poor
 koi kisi vijeti se milte hi twit karne lagata he to koi chadar chadhaane se pehle timeline par uskaa photo chadha detaa he
 Sometimes it seems that the leader will leave the security personnel one day and start walking with the four photos
 chal to rahe hai magar photo hi ab loktantric raajnneetik suraksha kaa nayaa hathiyaar ho gaya he
 Photo of him sitting in the train, photo of where he is going to get off the train
 soshal media par is photo or us photo main tulana hoti he
 Look, they are going alone in the empty compartment, see they are going with everyone in the loaded bogie
 suchanaaen kam ho rahi hai
 Questions are getting less answers
 bas photo bhej diye jate hai
 There is no photo of the work done, but there is a photo of it showing while working
 aap sawaal kiijie ki kaam nahin ho rahaa he to agle din kisi jagah par jaakar netaa ji photo khinchavaa aate hai
 The political person must campaign and tell about his work, but sometimes it seems that it is getting excessive
 kya twitor or fasebuk par har din lakhon mitric photo kachra paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 An image does not last long
 jab ek photo se aap aahlaadit hote hai doosraa photo aa jaataa he ki are aap bekaar main khush ho rahe the
 See this photo aap kisi bhi sarkari mukhiya yaa pravaktaaon ke twit dekhiye
 Information is less, photo is more
 vayusena ke jahaaz se utarate saamaanon or logon kii tasveeron kii bharmaar he
 It seems that all these are being made for photo only
 ek baar nahin baar baar aisi tasviren twit ho rahi hai
 From Yemen to Nepal, the commendable work has been converted into photo-work
 zarur isse dharna badali he or desh kaa naam bhi hota he lekin kya chhavi hi in prayaason kii ekmaatr soochna he
 You can see how many such pictures
 aisa lagata he ki sara aaparishan vishalkay jahaazon ke bhitari maidaanon main hi chal rahaa he
 Disaster or aid operations are full of information and lessons, but all that is missing now
 geetkaar or lekhak neelesh misra kii baat thik lagi ki garv hota he ki bharat pahal kar rahaa he lekin pal-pal kii tasveeron kaa pradarshan kuch khatak rahaa he
 Help has its own dignity, but publicity should also have a limit
 seva hamaara dharm he to yah bhi bhartiya darshan he ki kisi kii madad karo yaa kisi ko kuch do to har kisi se mat kaho
 The government or political party must strike a balance
 niswaarth seva ko prachaar seva main nahin badla janaa chahie
 Many state governments have also tried to convert these occasions into photo worthy commendable works
 jab centre sarkaar kar hi rahi he to alag alag rajya sarkarein kyon kud rahi hai
 Many people from Nepal are saying that names of help are coming here
 photo khinchaa kar chale ja rahe hai
 The same situation has also happened for voluntary organizations
 har madad ko ek sankhya main badla ja rahaa he or ek ek sankhya ko jod kar hazaar tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The number is a new weapon in this photo war
 har netaa ke paas selfi or photo ke liye vakt he
 If you ask the common man, we will get cried that so-and-so e-mailed the leader, even went home but did not meet
 kaam to nahin hua par mulaakaat kii photo twit ho gai
 The comments aisi hi hode vipaksh main ho gai he
 a formula has become that a good photo can make someone a good leader
 vaicharik vimarsh kam paidaa kiye ja rahe hai
 Photo struggle is happening more
 rahul gandhi yatra par hai
 Are on a photo-trip in a way
 har pal kii tasviir he
 If the ruling party has become photo-side then the opponent has also become photo-side
 photo kaa jawaab photo he
 From the ship to the train are seen with the children
 thik usee tarah jaise pradhanmantri ruk kar selfi khinchane lagate hai yaa khinchne lagate hai
 Questions arise on the image of the Aam Aadmi Party, then suddenly from the next day, photographs of new types of public relations start appearing
 yahi kaam sarkaar or virdohi bhi kar rahe hai
 The minister tweets a photo with such a title while listening to the talk of the people in the Phalane locality
 samasya kya thi or samaadhaan hua yaa nahin yaa koun si nai baat thi jisase jaanane ke liye daftar chhodkar unhen janaa padaa yah sab hamaari jaankaree kaa hissaa nahin he
 Just a photo
 demokrasi ko koreokrasi main badal diya gaya he
 Everything is choreographed
 isiilie kahata hum ki ye demokrasi nahin he
 Now it has become choreocracy
 loktantr ko kisi stadium main sajaa diya gaya he
 Preparations take several days before the leader's arrival
 theme dizine hote hai or uskaa tivi se prasaaran hota he
 Like a single dance India dance
 har pal kii tasviir lee jaati he or twit kiya jaataa he
 From the party to the individual leaders, now they have started to create such a team that transforms their every work into a photo
 netaaon ke yahaan banaai ja rahi soshal media kii timen ab wo kaam kar rahi hai jo shaadi byaah yaa saal ke aakhri dinon main event taiyaar karne vaali companiyaan karti hai
 Whether the padyatra or the address of the people in the stadium is all being decorated in such a way that every frame of it gives a new photo
 swaagat he aapkaa koreokrasi main
 We are all becoming self-conscious citizens
 gaur se dekhenge ki aapke raajnneetik chintan ke spes ko photo se bhar diya gaya he
 In the morning, the photo starts coming on Twitter
 kisase mil rahe hai, kya pahan rahe hai or kise kya de rahe hai

 amarmani ke bete amanmanitreepathi kii patni sara kii guuruuvaar ko sadak haadase main maut ho gai thi
 He was cremated on Friday, but no one from Ammani's family came to attend

 At Lucknow Civil Hospital, Amanmani misbehaved with his supporters along with media persons
 narco test kii mangajankaree ke mutabik, sara ke parivaar ko dhamkee bhare phone aa rahe hai
 Her family is being asked to withdraw the case

 Sara's husband Ammani Tripathi has demanded a narco test
 parivaar chahta he ki narco test ke jariye haadase kaa sach ujagar ho sake
 Expecting a fair investigation, Niti's sister Niti said that the car accident in Firozabad killed her sister and the brother-in-law Ammani not coming to scratch creates doubts in her own right

 ' anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaanon ko kamjor kiye jane or jammu-kashmir or ladakh ko centreshasit pradesh banane kii ghoshnaa ke baad pashchim bengal ke pahari jilon main phir se sargharmiyaan tej ho gai hai
 The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), the most influential of the hills right now, and the rebel faction of the party led by Vinay Tamang intensified their old demand for Gorkhaland (parts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Terai and parts of Duar in West Bengal)
 Done
 ve kshetra ke liye ek alag rajya yaa phir centreshasit pradesh kaa darja chaahate hai
 Before the 2019 elections, 'gorkha pride' was the biggest issue among all political parties here, including the ruling Trinamool Congress
 bhaajapa ke chunaav ghoshnaptr main yahaan tak kaha gaya tha ki party ''is mudde kaa sthaayee rajnatik samaadhaan khojane kii disha main kaam karne ke liye patibaddh he
 The GJM sent a joint delegation of other hill parties, such as the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM), a fortnight ago to meet Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai to discuss the issue
 
 jijeem ke mahasachiv roshan giri, jo pashchim bengal sarkaar ke lukout notice jari kiye jane ke baad party adhyaksh vimal gurung ke saath faraar chal rahe hai, kehete hai, ''agar gorkhaland ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa to bhi ise ek vidhansabha ke saath uti kaa darja diya jaae
 Gurung, an entrepreneur from Manipur and BJP MP Raju S
, addressed the issue
 bista, jinka aresas ke saath gaharaa judaav rahaa he, ko chunaa he
 "we want a trilateral meeting as soon as possible," Bista said
 hamen tiemasi anaavashyak rup se pareshaan kar rahi he
 He is to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah soon
 bista pehle hi loksabhaa ko is mudde ke 'sthaayee samaadhaan' kii aavashyaktaa kii yaad dilaa chuke hai
 Since 2009, the BJP has been getting the support of the hill people (80 per cent Gorkha) for the last three terms by hanging carrots to form a separate state
 june, 2017 main paharipoon main 104-divasiy hadtaal ke baad bhi, centre kii ore se koi thos patibaddhta nahin dikhaai gai thi
 Then BJP MP from Darjeeling SS Ahluwalia also did not visit his constituency during this period
 kadave anubhav ke baad bhi, naam na chaape jane kii shart par jijeem ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''hamaare paas koi vikalp nahin he
 We are fighting a state government (TMC), which is implicating our workers and leaders in false cases
 ham bhaajapa kii madad ke bina tiemasi se nahin lard sakate
 However, Bista has managed to convince Gurung that he should not take up arms
 2017 ke andolan ke kaaran teen maheene se adhik samay ke liye is kshetra ke logon kaa jivan dubhar ho gaya tha or janata ne ise pasand bhi nahin kiya
 The problem for the BJP is that it has to fight a TMC campaign in the rest of Bengal, in which it says that if the saffron party comes to power in the state, it will break it
 agar tiemasi is baat ko logon ke dimag main baitha sake, to 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaav jeetne kaa bhaajapa kaa sapana chakanachur ho saktaa he
 State President Dilip Ghosh said that BJP has not made any commitment to 'gorkhaland'
 ghosh kii baat par chutki lete hue, bengal ke cabinet mantri gautam deb kehete hai, ''bhaajapa ko gorkhaland ko lekar apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
 Sources say that the BJP has asked Bista to focus on a "permanent political solution" and keep separatist elements under its influence until a permanent solution is found to the issue

 maanavrahit rail crossing par ek or haadasahua
 a unmanned rail crossing carrying children was hit by a high speed train on Thursday morning in Mau district of Uttar Pradesh
 chah maasoom bacchon kii maukey par hi maut ho gai jabaki darjan bhar buree tarah jakhmi hue
 Serious injured have been referred to BHU hospital
 iske baad gussaye hue logon ne jam laga diya or ve vahaan phatak banavaane kii maang karne lage
 But this is not the first incident of a collision with a vehicle carrying children
 iske pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Recently, a similar tragic incident took place in Andhra Pradesh in which many children died tragically
 vahaan bhi pehle janata ne rail adhikariyon ke khilaaf awaz uthaai or rail phatak banane kii maang kii
 But there is a similarity between this and Mau's incident
 donon maamalon main gadiyon ke driver kaan main yearphone lagaakar gane sun rahe the or unhen na to train dikhi or na hi uski awaz sunai di
 He played with the lives of innocent children and broke the road law, which the children had to pay for
 puure bharat main ye ghatnaayen aam hai
 The negligence by which people cross the unmanned rail crossing or do not even see it is usually punishable by death
 har saal saikadon logon kii jaane rail crossing par chali jaati he
 People do this despite knowing that it can be dangerous
 unhen apni or dusron kii jaan kii parvaah nahin hoti
 After the accident, the public agitates demanding rail gates
 lekin tab koi yah awaz nahin uthaata ki galati kiski he
 What can be expected in a country where people cross overpowered tracks even in gate crossings? If there are hundreds of incidents of unmanned crossings, then hundreds of such incidents also happen at gates with watchmen
 kai maamle to aise bhi aae jisamen logon ne jabardastee phatak khulwakar apane vaahanon ko trek paar karavaaya
 There are thousands of rail gates across the country which do not have watchmen
 lekin vahaan soochna patt lage hue hai, speed braker bane hue hai or dur se train bhi dikhti he
 But people do not see them and are not careful
 adheer hokar yaa utaavlepan main phatak paar karne kii koshish karte hai
 After the accident, they demand a watchman
 lekin desh bhar ke lagbhag 35,000 rail crossing par chaukeedaar tainaat karnaa aarthik tangi se jujh rahe railway ke liye sambhav nahin he
 State governments have to participate in it
 agar unhen aisa lagata he ki yah bahut jaruri he to ve iske liye railway kii aarthik madad kar sakate hai
 But the state governments seem indifferent in this matter and the public is not ready to follow even the normal rules of security

 Samsung's 64MP camera smartphone can be launched next month guuruuvaar ko narendra modi dilli main bijepi chunaav samiti kii pehali aupchaarik baithak kii adhyakshata karenge
 The party has not disclosed the agenda of the meeting, but it is believed that Modi's rally and meetings may be disturbing
 is bich ye kayaas bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki chunaav samiti ke sadasyon ke naam kaa bhi elaan ho saktaa he
 After being made the chairman of the campaign committee, the entire party's eyes are on Modi
 ummid ye ki wo prachaar or party ko nayi disha denge
 The first meeting was called by Modi in a hurry, in which many did not reach the General Secretary
 ab modi party karyaalay main pehle sansadeey board kii baithak main hissaa lenge or phir prachaar samiti ke sadasyon ko bhi baithak main shaamil kar liya jayega taaki jo faisle hon usapar turant hi samiti kii muhar lag jaae
 However, the party is not clearing the agenda of this meeting
 haalanki, prachaar samiti ke sadasyon ke naam kaa elaan ab tak nahin hua he, lekin sanket mil rahe hai ki isamen 15 se 16 sadsy honge
 In which 9 General Secretaries, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Sudhanshu Trivedi, Piyush Goyal and two Associate General Ministers will be present
 modi ne apni pehali baithak main ye samajha diya tha ki alpsankhyakon ko naram karne kaa agenda bhi chalegaa
 Soon after, a separate charter for minorities was announced
 ab charchaa is baat par hogi kii modi kii desh bhar main reliyaan, kaaryakarta sammelnon ko antim rup kaise diya jaae
 But it is clear that the final decision will be taken by the Parliamentary Board
 tabhi to sansadeey board kii baithak ke saath prachaar samiti kii baithak kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Perhaps Modi has also understood that it is necessary to carry the party along at the moment
 bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi ne ek nijee news channel ko die ek intervyuu main kaha ki unhone sampradayik bayaan dene vaale apni party ke netaaon par karrwai kii, jisase kii is tarah kii baton kii punrariti na ho
 Modi said in an interview that he took insider action against party leaders like his close aide Amit Shah and Bihar leader Giriraj Singh, who targeted Muslims in his statements
 unhone kaha ki unki is karrwai ke kaaran hi is tarah ke bayaan band ho gaye hai
 He said that i took a strong stand against it and because of this it all stopped
 agar maine andruni vyavastha ke tahat iskaa virodh nahin kiya hota to aapako nahin lagata ki yah jari rahata? unhone ankar se sawaal poocha ki kya yah nahin rukaa he? yah rukaa he yaa nahin? iskaa matlab he ki maine karrwai kii or aap samaj sakate hai
 Accusing the Election Commission, Modi accused the Election Commission that the Election Commission is harassing me and the BJP
 varanasi main apni raily ke liye anumati nahin die jane kii prishthbhumi main modi ne kaha ki unhen or bijepi ko chunaav ayog pareshaan kar rahaa he or vah chaahate hai ki chunaav ayog jawaab de
 Modi said that it is for the Election Commission to answer why we are being harassed
 khaastaur par kyon ek party ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he, kyon modi ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 a lot has happened to me but at the moment i do not want to go into that
 chunaav ayog ko faisla karne den
 He emphasized that he is not targeting the Election Commission
 modi ne kaha ki unhone ek bhi shabd nahin kaha he
 He said that it is his party BJP which has written a letter to the Election Commission, giving detailed explanation
 priyanka kii manshaa galat thimeh puche jane par ki priyanka gandhi ke neech raajnneeti sambandhi bayaan ko unhone kyon jatigat mode diya to modi ne spasht kiya ki us shabd kaa gujarati main arth he uske kareeb
 He understands Gujarati language best
 modi ne kaha ki maan lete hai ki maine galat samajha
 But even then, his intention behind such language was wrong
 gathbandhan par koi asar nahin padegayah poochne par ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mayawati, mamata banerjee, jayalalita par hamale se endie ko bahumat nahin milane kii sthiti main bhavishya main gathbandhan par bura asar hoga to unhone kaha ki raajnneeti is aadhaar par nahin kii jaati ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kya kaha gaya
 However, he said that the BJP will get a clear majority and it will form the strongest and most stable government after the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1984
 lekin unki baton se laga ki unhone apane daravaaje khule rakhe hai
 Religious discrimination, not modi, dismissed allegations that he was discriminating against people seeking asylum in India on religious grounds
 unhone supreme court ke faisle kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main bharat ko peedit hinduon kaa naiysargik ghar bataaya gaya he, jisamen algamalag maton ke log shaamil hai lekin ve bhartiya mul ke hai kyonki hindutv dharm nahin balki jivan jeene kaa tarika he
 But he wanted to know why Hindus from other countries are not being given citizenship in India even after several decades
 He said that infiltrators are helped here because they are vote banks
 pakistan se rishtepradhanmantri banane par pakistan ke khilaaf kadaa rukh apnaane kaa sanket dete hue unhone kaha ki bam visphoton evam golibari ke bich vaarta karnaa sambhav nahin he
 He said do you think it is possible to negotiate between the bombings and the firing? Explosions and shootings must first be stopped for appropriate negotiation

 Union thinker and economist Gurumurthy has said till date that two thousand rupee notes will also be closed
 gurumurti ne kaha he ki kuch saal main do hajaar ke note chalan se baahar ho jaaenge
 He claims that the two thousand currency notes have been raided by the government so that the gap of notes in the economy can be filled at the earliest after demonetisation
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki sarkaar chote noton par zyada bharosa karti he or isiilie bade noton ko agle paanch saal main chalan se baahar kar diya jayega
 He says that in the near future, a note of five hundred will be the biggest note
 iske baad dhai sau rupee or sau rupee ke note honge
 Gurumurthy holds an important place in the Vivekananda Foundation of the Sangh and during the time of notebandi, the people of the government have consulted him many times
 isliye, do hajaar rupee ke note band hone ko lekar diya gaya unka bayaan kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Demonetisation is like financial Pokhran, Gurumurthy termed the demonetisation move as financial Pokhran and said that it is expected that such a change in the economy will become an example
 unhone kaha ki is nirnay se jameen jaaydaad kii keemton main giravat kii shuruyaat hogi or paardarshita ko badhaava milegaa
 Describing demonetisation as a financial pokhran, Gurumurthy said that when people have surplus money, they have a desire to buy things that are not needed and thus increase irresponsible and heartless expenditure
 notebandi se bada badlaav aayega
 He said, the way Pokhran brought about a fundamental change in thinking
 koun sochataa tha ki america, bharat ke bare main sochega
 If we had not done nuclear tests, they would not have looked at you
 gurumurti ne kaha ki jis tarah se pokharan ke baad bharat main buniyadi badlaav aayaa or logon kii uske prati soch badali usee tarah vittiya pokharan se bhi buniyadi badlaav aayega, lekin ise samajhane, gananaa karne va logon ko iske bare main samajhane ke liye bahut alag soch samajha kii jarurat he
 It is noteworthy that India conducted nuclear tests in Pokhran in 1998 and the country joined the select countries which have nuclear weapons capability
 baraamad ho rahaa kaladhanjis kaledhan ko khatm karne ke liye sarkaar ne 2 hajaar ke note jari kiye, ab alag-alag jagahon se unheen 2 hajaar rupee ke noton kii baramadagi kaledhan ke rup main ho rahi he
 The seizure of a large amount of two thousand rupees has raised the question of demonetisation itself
 sawaal ye he ki jis ek adad do hajaar ke note ke liye aam log taras rahe hai, vahi note kaledhan ke kuberon ke paas aakhir lakhon kii taadaad main kahaan se pahunchate hai? The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Friday hoped that the Supreme Court's decision in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute case will come in favor of Hindus

 Joshi said, 'we are hopeful that the decision of the Supreme Court will come in favor of Hindus
 ' unase sawaal poocha gaya tha ki jab ucchtam nyaayalay kaa faisla aayega tab kya aresas use sweekaar karegaa
 The hearing of the politically sensitive Ayodhya case ended on Wednesday and the Supreme Court reserved its verdict on it
 is maamle main adaalat ke baahar samjhauta karne kii koshishon ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘yahaan lambey samay se madhyasthata ke jariye hal nikaalane kii koshishen kii gai lekin iskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Had it been so, the case would not have gone to court
 ' unhone kaha ki aresas lambey samay se ayodhya main prastaavit shri ram mandir ke nirmaan se pehle baadhaon ko hataane kii himaayat kar rahi he
 However this did not happen and the proceedings in the court continued
 vivaadit enarasi par ek sawaal ke jawaab main joshi ne kaha, ‘haalanki enarasi kii kavayad keval assam main hui lekin sabhi rajyon ko ise apnaanaa chahie or sunishchit karnaa chahie ki ghuspaithiyon ke kaaran bhartiya naagarik apane adhikaron se vanchit na ho
 States should adopt this for the welfare and protection of the country
 desh or rajya ke paas apane nagarikon kii asal sthiti honi chahie
 The Sarkaryawah of the RSS said that it is the responsibility of any government to know the real situation of its citizens in the state and identify the refugees and the administration should ensure that anti-national activities are stopped
 joshi ne kaha, ‘enarasi jaisi prakriya anivaary ban gayi he kyonki kuch rajyon main bahari logon kii sankhya adhik he jo raashtra virdohi takaton ke saath milakar kaam kar rahe hai or hinduon ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 He added, "NRC is also mandatory to identify intruders from neighboring countries to deal with the growing demographic imbalance and threat to the security of the country
" ' unhone daawa kiya ki pashchim bengal main ‘hinduon kaa jaateey safaya' kiya gaya or unhone is par chintaa jataayi
 He was questioned during the Durga Puja this month over the murder of three family members of a school teacher in Murshidabad
 joshi ne kaha, ‘ise fouran rokna hoga
 The silence of the Government of West Bengal is surprising in many ways because Bengal has a history of peace and brotherhood
 ' gauratlab he ki aresas or bhaajapa daawa kar rahi hai ki skool shikshak unka samarthak tha lekin peedit ke rishtedaaron or vyakti kii maa ne isse inkaar kiya he
 On the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Joshi said that the displaced Kashmiri Pandits should return to the state
 unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar ko yah sunishchit karne ke liye kadam uthaane chahie ki mul kashmiri apane paitruk sthanon par lauten or bina kisi dar ke rahe
 Endorsing the Uniform Civil Code across the country, Joshi said, 'law should be one for all in the country and not different for different people

 The Indian government had lodged a strong protest with the Chinese authorities regarding this incident
 balachandran shanghai ke nikat yuvu shahar kii ek adaalat main 31 disambar ko pesh hue the
 Diabetic patient Balachandran was not allowed to go out till the completion of the court proceedings and after some time he fell unconscious in the court itself

 Zhang Yu, deputy head of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi, was summoned by the Foreign Ministry and told him that this was not the way to deal with any diplomat

 When exiting the Foreign Ministry, Zhang said, this is a civil-commercial dispute
 ham is maamle ko sahi dhang se nipataane kaa puraa prayaas karenge

 Where he wanted to tell the Governor that the fees raised by Basundhara Teachers Training College are not correct
 hamaare paas college kaa paksh to nahin he magar laga ki sawaal ke prati eemaandaaree ne padayatra ke iraade ko majboot kiya he

 The health of colleagues was also deteriorated
 virodh main shavyatra bhi nikaali magar kuch nahin hua
 In June 2018, the Patna High Court ordered that the fees of b
ed College may increase
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki ujisi ke niyam ke anusaar bich satr main fees nahin bad sakati he
 There were different conditions in the High Court's decision, but in his name, one and a half lakh fees were made in several private colleges at once
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki badi hui fees dene kii aarthik kshamta nahin he or badhaane kaa tarika galat he isliye ve pradarshan kar rahe hai
 All these students went to our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna and told their grief
 bihar main pichley dinon bied kii fees ko lekar kai pradarshan hue
 Not only in Patna, but also in villages and towns
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki in bied sansthaanon main shikshakon kii jo sthiti he wo bhi koi pataa kar le to samaj aa jayega ki unka virodh kitna jaays he
 This is where i want to say that hundreds of people contact me every day
 maine kai baar kaha he ki main sabakaa dharna pradarshan nahin dikhaa saktaa, utane sansaadhan bhi nahin hai or na sambhav he
 What i am showing is not for one person but for everyone
 usase pataa chalata he ki prashasan or sarkaar kaa kya haal he
 Let's leave from Muzaffarpur and go to Shamli near Muzaffarnagar
 yahaan kisaanon se vaada kiya gaya tha ki 14 dinon ke bheetar ganne kaa bhugtan shuru ho jayega
 But the farmers who gave sugarcane to Shamli Mill have been owed more than 200 crores
 2017 ke november se may ke sizan kaa 83 karod rupaya baaki he
 There has been no payment for the season starting in November of 2018, while more than two and a half months are going to pass
 is sizan kaa bhi kareeb 150 karod kaa bakaayaa he
 Farmers from more than 50 villages are staging a strike here
 kisaanon ne sab kar liya magar pement nahin hua he
 There is a donation for the conflict and food is becoming water here
 yahaan shamali chini mil ke baahar kisaanon kaa jamghat kaaphi bada he
 Due to thousands of farmers, leaders are coming here and giving speeches
 isi zile se suresh rana ganna mantri hai magar ganna ke bhugtan ke liye kisaanon ko andolan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Here too, the farmers have donated and food and water is happening here
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki paisa samay par nahin miltaa to ve bacchon kii fees nahin bhar pate hai
 Due to non-payment of fees, teachers in school make them stand outside the class
 yaheen nahin sarkaar kii yojana he ki tay samay tak bijli bill dene se sarcharge kii maafee milegi magar paisa nahin hone ke kaaran skim kaa laabh nahin le paa rahe hai isliye unhen doharaa ghaataa ho rahaa he
 The District Magistrate has definitely talked to the farmers and filed an FIR against the mill but the money is not available
 iske liye ek din hindu or muslim kisaanon ne milakar janaaze kii namaaj bhi padhi
 Sir Mundaya and performed silently
 kisaan apane paise ke liye kya kya nahin kar rahe hai
 From offering Namaz to shaving the head
 darasal jab aap kisi pradarshan kii taraf badhate hai to rasta lanbaa ho jaataa he
 There are very few performances that result
 aashwaasano se khatm bhi hote hai magar thode samay ke baad shuru bhi ho jate hai
 There should be a Democracy Index in India, so that it can be known daily about the demands and demonstrations today
 kitne pradarshnon ke upar lathi chali or kitnon ke gyaapan liye gaye, kitnon main aashwaasan mila or kitnon ke nattejey aae
 This will show how much importance our democratic governments give to the people
 aap jaanate hai ki 13 point roster system lagu hone se vishvavidhyalayon main anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke aarakshan kaa lagu hone asambhav sa ho gaya he
 Those who understand this issue are saying that the reservation system in colleges and universities has ended
 ise lekar dilli vishvavidhyalay ke adahak shikshakon ne aakrosh pradarshan kiya
 Appointments in colleges have been almost stagnant for almost a year
 na general ko naukari mili or arakshit ko
 The situation has become more difficult due to the circular of the UGC and the Supreme Court order
 anusuchit jati or janajati, obisi ke chaatro kaa kahana he ki nae aadesh ke kaaran aarakshan kabhi lagu hi nahin hoga kyonki kisi ek vibhaag main ek saath kabhi bhi 10 yaa 13 post nahin aaenge
 49 by adding all the vacant posts in the first university
 5 pratishat arakshit kiya jaataa tha
 But now it will not be possible to consider the department as a unit
 isi ko lekar desh bhar ke tamaam collejon or uniwarsity main bechaini he
 Adhak teachers of Delhi University have said that they will also perform on 25 January
 uske baad 28 janvari ko bhi pradarshan karenge
 If the government brought the ordinance to 200 point roster i
e
 the old system was not implemented, then the process of demonstrations would continue
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon main pehle se chali aa rahi aarakshan vyavastha thapp ho gai he
 It is possible in India that there is no restoration in the university for a year and no one is bothered
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki pradarshan nahin ho rahe hai
 People are not raising voice
 balki ulta ho rahaa he
 The voice is getting up, it is not being heard
 2 aktubar 2017 ke live mint or kai media website par piyush goyal kaa bayaan chapa tha ki ve ek saal ke bheetar railway ke system main 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar denge
 The Railway Minister said at the India Economic Summit held in Delhi
 live mint ke anusaar unhone kaha tha ki trek ke navinikaran or suraksha ke kshetra main hi 2 lakh rojgaar kaa srijan ho saktaa he
 It has been more than a year and a half since, let the Railway Minister tell whether 2 lakh people have been given employment in the renovation and safety of the track
 12 maheene main das lakh rojgaar paidaa karne kii baat karne vaale goyal abhi tak do saal main ek lakh bahaali kii prakriya puri nahin kar paae hai
 Till date, it has not been known what happened to that statement giving ten million jobs
 kam se kam railway ke kantrecturon se maang kar hi hisaab de dete ki kiske yahaan kitne or kis str ke karmchaaree kaam par lage hai
 There was a work of five minutes
 har kuch maheene par naukariyon ko lekar bayaan aa jaataa he
 Once, NTPC graduate examination took place in Railways
 18 hazaar se adhik pad nikle lekin riselt aane ke baad chaar hazaar pad gata die gaye
 On 27 December 2017, in response to Mohammad Salim's question in the Lok Sabha, it is said that all the 2 lakh 22 thousand 159 posts in the railway are vacant
 inamen se anusuchit jati or janajati ke 41,128 pad khaali hai
 Did the Railways find out 2 lakh 22 thousand vacancies as of April 2017? nahin nikaali
 Ask the Railway Minister how many people have been given jobs instead of those who retire every year between 2014 and 2018
 simpal sawaal magar jawaab nahin milegaa
 In February last year, the Railways extracted more than 1 lakh 27 thousand vacancies
 rail mantri khud hi kah rahe hai ki prakriya puri hone main dhai maheene or lagenge yani march april tak biit jayega rigelt aane main
 It takes more than a year to complete the one hundred and twenty thousand restoration process
 wo bhi chunaav kaa dabaav he tab itani tezi he
 Is the entire process really complete, meaning the result will come, documents will be examined, medical will be done and joining will be done
 bahut dinon se to aisa nahin hua he, ho jaae to kya hi acha ho
 Right now the Railway Minister is talking of removing 1 lakh 32 thousand vacancy again
 zaahir he kisi bhi surat main 2019 ke ant se pehle isaki prakriya puri nahin hogi
 If it is done by March of 2020, consider it a reward
 chunaav he to elaan he
 It is a declaration because there is an election
 piyush goyal kehete hai ki agle do saal main ek lakh or ritair honge
 Are they going to remove ads before they retire and complete the restoration process
 rail mantri ke hisaab se agar har saal 40 se 50 hazaar ritair hote hai to kya ve bataa sakate hai ki railway ne 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 or 2018 main kitne logon ko unki jagah rakhaa
 The resumption of junior engineer has come two years after Shiv Prakash of Railway Employees Union
 13,487 padon kaa vigyaapan aayaa he
 What is the election, so the restoration of junior engineer has come
 ek angel or he
 The Railway Minister is not saying how many new jobs will be created
 ritair hone vaale logon kii jagah bhartee karenge lekin yah to apane aap hone vaali prakriya he
 What's new in this kya unhen nahin bataanaa chahie ki unke faislon se nae rojgaar paidaa hue hai
 Now watch this calculation carefully
 railmantri ne kaha ki railway 12 lakh logon ko rojgaar detii he
 Try to reverse the 2017 budget paper
 2015 se 2018 ke bich railway ke mainpavar ke lakshya main koi badlaav nahin he
 In 2015, the target was 13,26,437 manpower which increased to 13,31,433 in 2018
 yani teen saal main railway ke mainpavar main koi badlaav nahin hua
 This is in the budget orientation and was also reported by Pradeep Thakur in the Times of India on 2 March 2017
 ab aap saatven vetan ayog kii report dekhie, usamen centre sarkaar ke manjuur padon kii sankhya or khaali padon kii sankhya kaa hisaab milegaa
 According to this, on 1 January 2014, the number of sanctioned posts in the railway was 15 lakh 57 thousand
 magar mainpavar tha us vakt 13 lakh 61 hazaar
 The railways then had more than two lakh recruitment opportunities which did not
 ab rail mantri ke anusaar 13 lakh se ghatakar 12 lakh ho gaya he
 So, did the Railways again cut more than one lakh jobs
 agar aap 1 janvari 2014 ke manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se dekhen to railway ne teen lakh se adhik pad kam kar die hai
 The Railway Minister is talking of reinstatement of the retiree
 nae rojgaar paidaa karne kaa hisaab nahin de rahe hai
 Just now you heard how easily the Railway Minister is telling in October 2017 that even if 20 percent of the investment in railways will be labor cast, then one million people get work comfortably
 kya aap jaanate he yaa rail mantri ne aapako bataaya he ki railway main kantrect par kaam karne vaale logon kii kya haalat he, unke kya halaat he
 Recently the CAG has reported on this
 sieji ne un thekedaaron ke yahaan karmchaariyon kii sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya he jinhen railway ne 2014 se lekar 2017 ke bich 35,098 karod kaa bhugtan kiya he
 After studying 463 contracting companies, the CAG has said that even 50 percent of the law made to stop the exploitation of workers does not apply
 chuttee ke paise milane chahie magar na to chuttee milti he na chuttee kaa paisa
 The contractors digested several hundred crores of workers
 niyam ke anusaar check se paisa dena tha magar cash dete rahe
 There is no record of 212 contractor how the money is given
 yahi nahin bhavishya nidhi kaa bhi paisa nahin katataa he
 The officials of rail, labor, provident fund organization do not go to investigate
 kulamilaakar railway jin companiyon ko apana kaam karaane ke liye hazaron karod rupee detii he, vahaan bhi niyamon ke hisaab se na to puraa vetan miltaa he or na hi suvidha
 There is not a better working condition
 ye sieji kii report main likhaa he
 In the job series you saw how crores of rupees come to the commissions in filling the exam form
 bhale vah pariksha puri na ho magar paise puure aa jate hai

 However, because the film did not work, the film cleared for Ranveer
 punjab sarkaar ne 12veen kaksha kii itihaas kii paathya pustak se sikh itihaas ke 23 paath hataakar vipaksh ko hamalaa karne kaa mauka de diya he
 The deleted text includes the history of Sikh Gurus and warriors, the war between the British and the Sikhs, the conflict between the Sikhs and the Mughals, including Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki punjab main padhai jane vaali itihaas kii paathya pustak se ekamusth 23 paath hataanaa sahi nahin he
 The opposition party Akali Dal has demanded an inquiry into the issue and immediately rejoined the deleted text in the text book
 purv shiksha mantri dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki unako barahavin kaksha ke itihaas kii pathyapustak main bhartiya itihaas padhaane se koi gurej nahin he lekin agar chaatr punjab kaa hi itihaas nahin padhenge to vahapunjab ke guruor yoddhaon dwaara di gai qurbaaniyon ke bare main kaise janenge?akali dal ke alaava punjab sarkaar pramukh vipakshi party aam aadmi party ke nishane par bhi he
 Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira has said that the decision to remove 23 texts related to the history of Punjab from the text book will not only keep the youth in the dark but also confuse them
 sarkaar ko chahie ki hataae gaye paath phir se pustak main jodakar apni galati kaa sudhaar karen
 Meanwhile, hurt by the Akali Dal attack, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has said that the Akali Dal is unnecessarily hurling the case as some changes have been made in the syllabus of class XII and syllabus of class XI
 12veen kipustak se hataae gaye pathanichali kaksha main jode ja rahe hai
 This book is currently in the press and there is no question of removing the text of Sikh history
 udhar jab is bare main shiksha mantri opi soni se baat kii gai to unhone maamle ke bare main anbhigyata jaahir kii or kaha ki agar paathya pustak main koi gadabadi he to use jald hi durust kar liya jayega
 The Department of Education has put a big issue to the opposition by eliminating 23 lessons outright
 vipaksh ise bhunaane main laga hua he or sarkaar katghare main he
 This decision is also being given political and religious color, because the matter is related to Sikh religious gurus, so the government is on target
 gujarat main beete dinon swaghoshit goraksha samooh ke logon dwaara chaar dalit yuvakon kii berahami se pitayee kaa maamla koi iklauta maamla nahin he
 In fact till April this year, 409 cases of Dalit oppression have been registered in Gujarat
 haalanki 11 july ko saurashtra ke una main chaar dalit yuvakon ke saath ghati ghatana ne rashtriya str par dalit utpeedan kii jo bahes chhedi uske kaaran police ko may main amarelli jile ke rajula kasbe main nau dalit yuvakon par hamalaa karne vaale isi tarah ke chah 'go rakshakon' ko hiraasat main lenaa padaa

 is aadhaar par dekha jaae to gujarat main har saal dalit utpeedan kii 1000 ghatnaayen, jabaki pratidin ke hisaab se teen ghatnaayen pratidin ghatin
 Activists working for Dalit rights say that the rate of action in such cases is three to five per cent, which causes the convicts to escape action and hence such incidents are increasing
 rajula main 22 may kii dopaher isi tarah kaa go rakshakon kaa ek dal badi gadiyon or bike par savaar ho dalit basti main ghus aayaa tha
 Like the Una incident, these so-called cow guards also brought sticks and knives

 Dalit activist Rameshbhai Babaria, who works in the area, said that the cow guards had broken the hands and feet of the Dalits and beat them up badly

 Like Una's Samadhiyala, the Go Rakshakas made a video of their atrocities with an unkind attitude
 lekin rathod ke saath anya logon ne police main isaki shikaayat kii to police ne vah video sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 The most important thing is that the Dalit community does not remove the skin of the dead animals, but the livestock and for this the local body has provided them a place
 rathod ne bataaya ki jab ve shikaayat karne gaye to police ne kaha tha, 'tumhe lagata he ki tum is tarah kaa koi bhi behuda video laaoge or ham us par vishwaas kar lenge?' The police had filed a complaint in this case after a full day, that too against only 19 people, while more people were involved in the incident
 haalanki shikaayat darj hone ke baad bhi koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Social workers and villagers again went to the police on 31 May

 ) kendriya aparaadh record beuro ke anusaar, gujarat main 2001 se ab tak dalit utpeedan ke 14,500 maamle saamne aae hai

 On the afternoon of 22 May in Rajula, a team of similar cow guards entered the Dalit colony riding on big vehicles and bikes
 una ghatana kii tarah hi ye tathakthith go rakshak bhi laathiyaan or churi saath laae the
 Some even had swords
 ilaake main kaam karne vaale dalit kaaryakarta rameshbhai babariyaa ne bataaya ki go rakshakon ne daliton ke haath-pair tod daale the or buree tarah pitayee kii thi

 But with Rathore, others complained to the police, the police refused to accept the video

 However, no action was taken even after the complaint was filed

 Rathore says, "we had no hope that the police would do anything in it
" police ke saamne hamen phir se jaleel hona padaa
 After this, Dalit activists led by Babaria took out a 70 km long motorcycle rally from Amreli to Rajula on 7 July and demanded action
 babariyaa ne kaha, 'uske baad 11 july ko samadhiyaala main ghatana ghati or police dar gai
 Taking immediate action, they arrested six people
 isse pehle ve hamase kehete rahe ki sabhi faraar hai or ve kisi kii talash nahin kar paae hai

 What we do nothing for the beauty of the face
 parlor janaa, gharelu upaay karnaa, bazaar main bikne vaale saundarya utpaadon kaa istemaal karnaa or na jane kya-kya
 It is true that the face is most noticeable and in this way it is necessary to take care of it the most, but what about your feet? Beauty should be complete and in such a situation, people ignore the feet the most
 pairon kii sahi dekhbhaal nahin karnaa kabhi na kabhi aapako sharmindagi mahasoos kara saktaa he
 Not taking care of the feet can not only stain your beauty, but it can also cause pain
 agar aapane abhi tak apane pairon par dhyaan nahin diya he to kam se kam in sardiyon main inako andekha na karen
 Many people think that taking care of the feet is a difficult and hard work but it is not so
 neembu ke istemaal se aap chahen to kuch hi dinon main apane pairon ko khubasurat bana sakati hai
 Lemon is such a thing that is easily found in every household

 The dead skin and scab helps clean the heel because of the help of the skin
 is samasya ke bad jane se kai baar khun aane kii bhi sthiti ho jaati he
 The only and only solution to this problem is to clean the dead skin so that there can be soft and new skin
 aise main lemon scrub kaa istemaal karnaa bahut phydemand hota he
 Lemon is something in which every part is beneficial
 aap chahen to neembu ke saath shahad ko bhi mila sakate hai
 Prepare a mixture by mixing some amount of brown sugar, lemon juice and olive oil
 isse scrub karne par ded skin to saaf ho hi jaaegi, saath hi ediyaan komal bhi banengi
 2
 chamak laane ke liye bhi phydemand he neemooninbu main amleey gun paaya jaataa he
 It is also rich in vitamin c properties
 neembu kii yahi khaasiyat pairon or nakhunon ke liye vardaan he
 While the use of lemon reduces blackness, on the other hand, nails also glow
 do se teen neembu lekar uskaa ras nichod len
 Take some warm water in a vessel and put this juice in it
 aap chahen to gulab ke phool kii kuch pattiyon ko bhi isamen daal sakati hai
 Soak the feet in this solution for some time and scrub the feet with light hands
 aisa karne se aapaki thakaan to kam hogi hi, saath hi pair bhi khubasurat banenge
 3
 taazgi kaa ehsaspairon ko scrub karne or unhen dhone se taazgi kaa ehsaas hota he
 Add a few drops of honey to lukewarm water and squeeze 2-3 lemon juice in it
 kuch der tak pairon ko isi ghol main dubokar rakhen
 In addition, if you wish, you can also massage the feet by mixing lemon juice and honey
 aisa karnaa bhi pairon ko saaf or khubasurat rakhane main bahut phydemand hoga
 4
 badboo se chhutkaarakai log aise hote hai jinke pairon se badboo aati he
 No matter how beautiful the feet are, but if they smell, no one would like to be with that person
 ek bartan main gunaguna pani lekar usamen do se teen neembu nichod len
 Add a few drops of any oil for moisturization
 aisa niyamit karne se na keval aapke pairon se badboo aana kam ho jaaegi balki ye mulaayam bhi bane rahenge
 5

 In such a situation, the use of lemon is very beneficial

 but not the actual act
 Let's talk more
 
 
 read more and learn more about all the things that can be avoided just by the use of a simple precaution
 With condoms you can have planned pregnancies and protected sex
 
 
 which can curb HIV and STD cases

 karunanidhi kaa raajnneetik vaaris banakar ubhare unke bete em
 K
 stallinadiemke ke nirvirodh adhyaksh ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, elder brother MK Alagiri, who has presented a challenge to Stalin, has agreed to work with him
 is tarah agardiemakemen unki vaapasi hoti he totamilnaduki raajnneeti main ek bada parivartan ho saktaa he
 Let me tell you that just a week after Alagiri Nekrunanidhik's death, Stalin had opened the front, questioning the assignment of DMK
 karunanidhi ke samadhi sthal marina bich se unhone kaha tha ki diemke kaaryakarta unke saath hai
 Stalin may be the acting president but does not work and does not have the ability to win the party
 alaagiri kii chunauti ke bich stallin diemke ke adhyaksh banane main safal rahe
 Now want to return to Alagiri's party
 itnaa hi nahin ve stallin ke netritv main kaam karne ko bhi taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, the decision of his return to the party is in the hands of Stalin
 abhi tak diemke ke itihaas main stallin party kaa adhyaksh pad sanbhaalane vaale duusare hi netaa hai
 Whereas before this, Karunanidhi had been the president of the party for 49 years
 karunanidhi ko apane jivan kaal main hi uttaradhikari stallin or bete alaagiri ke bich sangharsh se rubaru hona padaa tha
 In 1980, Karunanidhi sent Alagiri to South Tamil Nadu to take over the reins of the party to ease the growing rift between the two brothers
 iske baad bhi donon bhai ke bich raajnneetik varchasv kii jang nahin thami
 Karunanidhi then expelled Alagiri from the DMK in 2014 due to Stalin's opposition
 karunanidhi ke nidhan ke baad alaagiri ne stallin ke khilaaf sabase badi chunauti banakar khadey hue the, lekin unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki
 Alagiri has called a big rally on 5 September, but now he wants to return to the DMK
 darasal1984 or 2016 ko chhod den to tamilnadu main satta parivartan ko lekar ek pattern rahaa he
 Every time the people of Tamil Nadu oust the party in power
 satta lagaataar diemke or edieke ke bich badalati rahi he
 But this time the conditions have changed
 edieke ke mul voters ke paas vaastavik ediemke or titivi dinakaran kii aguwai vaali ediemke ke bich chunane kaa vikalp he
 In such a situation, the DMK may get the political benefit of sympathy due to Karunanidhi's death

 Premium charges apply!! The Committee of Administrators (COA), which often questioned the BCCI officials' foreign visits, faced the opposite situation today when Treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary questioned General Manager (cricket Operations) Saba Karim's visit to Britain
 bisisiai ke koshadhyaksh choudhary ne kareem ke liye nau din kii avadhi kii khatir 4,050 dollar ke mahangaai bhatte ko manjuuri dene ke kaaran puche or daure se jude dastavej maange
 Karim's daily dearness allowance is (around) 30,000 rupees, excluding hotel rentals
 koshadhyaksh ne prashaskon kii samiti ko bheje apane i-mail main pehle ke maamalon se tulana karte hue kaha ki prashaskon ne kis tarah tii-20 siries ke dauraan sachiv kaa britain daura roak diya tha or kaha tha ki unke daure se koi phayda nahin milegaa
 ICC T-20 ranking: Rahul among top three, Finch created history
 He wrote, 'I got an email asking me to sign a letter to Thomas Cook (travel company) so that Syed Saba An amount equal to $ 4,050 could be released as dearness allowance for Karim's proposed nine-day visit to Britain
 ’koshadhyaksh ne kaha ki vah is par hastakshar kar denge, lekin vah (sioe ke sadasyon) vinod raay or dyna adulji se chaar sawaal poochna chaahate hai
 He said, 'the first question is related to the document showing the motive of his (karim's) visit to Britain and the decision-making process and the invitation from the ECB (england and Wales Cricket Board) or any correspondence with the ECB before the approval
 ’choudhary ne kaha, ‘doosraa sawaal yah he ki sambandhit dastavej dikhaate hai ki manjuuri di gai he
 The third issue relates to information on whether another employee has recently been to the UK
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aakhri sawaal ki agar is baat kii sambhaavna he ki haal main is tarah kii koi yatra hui, to kya vah karmchaaree vah kaam nahin kar saktaa tha jiske liye kareem ab vahaan jaaenge?’choudhary ne kaha ki prashaskon kii samiti ke nirdeshon ke tahat unpar sawaal karne se ‘roak’ he, lekin vah apni saamaanya jigyaasa ke liye yah jaananaa chaahate hai
 'T-20: India is invincible in 3-match series for two years, scoring 8-0', he said, 'I am having some hesitation in talking to you on this issue, because i would normally ask the employee for more details and i do not want to bother the members of the COA regarding satisfying themselves with details, clearances and bills as sometimes there are more than 3,000 payments in a month, which i would normally check
 Hia
 ’koshadhyaksh ne kaha, ‘lekin aapke nirdesh mujhe karmchaaree se koi vivaran / bill vagairah maangane se rokte hai or mere liye jaruri he ki aapke nirdesh ke anuroop main keval sioe se is tarah ke vivaran maanguun
 That is why i am writing this email
 ’unhone kaha ki vah kareem ke daure kaa makasad jaananaa chaahate hai, kyonki haal main kaaryvahak sachiv amitabh choudhary ko aisa karne se roak diya gaya tha
 Chaudhary referred to an e-mail in which the COA had said about the visit of the acting secretary that it would not benefit the BCCI
 unhone kaha, ‘isliye haalanki mujhe nahin pataa ki kareem ko nau din ke daure par kyon bheja ja rahaa he, mere hastakshar maangane ke liye bheje gaye patr ke alaava mujhe koi kagajaat, dastavej yaa patr nahin bheje gaye jinase meri jigyaasa shant hoti
 The treasurer also said that he wanted clarification, as it is necessary for the BCCI to follow the rules framed under the Foreign Regulatory Management Act (FEMA)

 Shivpal Yadav called Akhilesh Yadav and congratulated him in advance for being elected president
 chachaa bhattije ke bich sulah ke asaar bane he
 Shivpal has taken initiative at Mulayam's behest and has forgotten all the grievances and extended his hand of friendship to Akhilesh
 sutron kii maane to mangalvaar ko shaam mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav ke bich is mudde par baat hui
 After this, Shivpal also talked to his close friends on this issue

 According to SP sources, the conversation between Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav was closed for a long time, the break of the conversation has been broken by Shivpal Yadav, Shivpal Yadav has taken a new initiative before Akhilesh Yadav met Mulayam Singh Yadav in the past And in this meeting of father and son for hours, Akhilesh had also invited Mulayam Singh Yadav to attend the national session, since then it was being speculated differently
 -living Shivpal Yadav will look for a new option or will make a compromise with Akhilesh

 While Shivpal kept saying that the command of the party should be given to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 lekin akhilesh ne ek nahin maani
 After this, Shivpal started talking about forming a new party
 pichley dinon nai party kaa elaan bhi hone vaala tha, lekin mulaayam ne ain vakt par shivpal ke armaanon par pani pher diya or nai party banane se saaf manaa kar diya
 After this, Shivpal was completely isolated in the party
 chachaa bhattije ke bich sulah ke asarhap bataa den ki samaajawaadee partike sutron ke mutabik buudhvaar dopaher se pehle tak chachaa-bhattije main sulah ho jaaegi
 In view of this, the people of the Yadav family will be united at Netaji's house and Akhilesh Yadav will find ways of reconciliation between Vashivpal Yadav
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sulah 95 fisadi ho chukaa he
 Just have to be sealed from late evening till tomorrow
 maaloom ho ki shivpal ab is baat par ade hue hai ki unke jin teen karibiyon ko akhilesh ne party se nikaala he, unhen dobaaraa se party main waapas laayaa jaae
 Apart from this, Shivpal now wants the post of National General Secretary for himself, on which Netaji also agrees
 haalanki shivpal yadav ke rashtriya raajnneeti main sabase bada roda ramgopal yadav hai
 Ramgopal feels that with Kishivpal's active national politics, his political stature will be weakened
