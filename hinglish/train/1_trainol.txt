 pakistan main 2008 ke mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ke saath najar aane vaale rajdoot valid abu ali waapas pakistan nahin aa rahe hai
 There are reports in the Pakistani media about his coming back, but Palestine has denied this news
 philistin ke videsh mantralay ne is khabar kaa khandan kiya he
 According to the statement of the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 'ali, our ambassador in Pakistan, is still in Palestine and our stand has not changed in this matter
 ham ab bhi apane pichley hafte ke rukh par kaayam hai
 It is being claimed in the Pakistani media that Palestine has reappointed Ambassador Waleed Abu Aliko, who is seen alongside Hafiz Saeed
 isse pehle, philistin nebharat ke kade aitaraajake baad is maamle main bharat ke paksh main kadam uthaaya tha
 a report by Pakistan news channel Geo News quoted Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) chairman Maulana Tahir Ashrafi as claiming that Waleed Abu Ali has been repatriated to Pakistan
 report main kaha gaya he ki philistin ke raashtrapati mahmud abbaas ne ali ko dobaaraa paak rajdoot bana diya he
 Ashrafi claimed on the Pak channel that he had appealed to the Palestinian President and the Chief Justice of Palestine that Waleed Abu Ali be redeployed to Pakistan
 unhone daawa kiya he ki unki yah apil manjuur bhi kar lee gai he
 He has also claimed that Ali will come to Pakistan on Wednesday and resume his work
 yah ghatnakram bhartiya piem narendra modi ke philistin daure se thik pehle hua he
 Modi is scheduled to visit Palestine in February
 bharat main philistini duutavas ne bhi is khabar kii jaankaree hone se inkaar kiya he
 It has been said from the embassy, 'don't know where this news came from
 hamaari jaankaree ke mutabik valid abu ali ab bhi philistin main hi hai
 'we don't know from where you got this information about Palestine Ambassdor to Pakistan being reinstated
 As per our knowledge he is very much in Palestine as of now: Palestine Embassy in New Delhi to ANI on Pak media's reports on Palestine reinstated its ambassador to Pakistanpic
 twitter
 com / tuzzokc98k— ANI (@ani)january 7, 2018aapako yaad dilaa den ki ali ne hafiz said ke sanghathan difah-e-pakistan council kii rawalpindi main hui raily main hissaa liya tha
 He was also seen hugging with Hafiz and addressing the rally
 is raily main hafiz ne bharat, kulbhushan jadhav, kashmir or america ke bare main jehar ugala tha
 After this, India took up the matter at the top level
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne is par kadi pratikriya main philistin sarkaar se kaha tha ki ise kisi bhi keemat par sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In response, Palestinian Ambassador to India Adnan Abu Al Haja said, "our country attaches great importance to our relationship with India and has always stood with India in the fight against terror
" 'bharat main philistini rajdoot ne apni safai main kaha tha, 'hamaare rajdoot hafiz said ko nahin jaanate the
 When Hafiz gave the speech, the ambassador asked who it was? This was followed by our Ambassador's speech
 hamaare rajdoot ne bhaashan diya or vahaan se chale gaye
 'the Palestinian Ambassador in India said,' Despite this, we cannot allow it and that's why we are taking the decision to recall the Ambassador
 ' hafiz ke sanghathan kii ore se bulaai gai yah raily kathith taur par philistiniyon ke sangharsh ke samarthan main hui thi
 Two people, including a village headman, were killed in Firozabad district of Uttar Pradesh
 police sutron ne shanivaar ko yahaan bataaya ki jile ke gauthua gaanv main shuukravaar der raat jameen ke vivaad ko lekar devendra naamak vyakti ne gram pradhan satya prakaash (45) kii eent se tabadatod prahaar kar hatya kar di
 He said that in Jarkhi village, unidentified people shot Hakim Singh (55) sleeping near his tubewell
 police ne maamle darj kar kaarywahi shuru kar di he
 The third phase of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is of paramount importance for SP and the biggest challenge for Akhilesh Yadav will be to save sp's stronghold Etawah and surrounding districts
 is ilaake se kai jagah sapa se baagi ummidavaar maidan main hai or bijepi kii puri koshish he sapa ke kile ko dhaha diya jaae
 Akhilesh is well aware of this, so rallies in Etawah and Mainpuri are sweating profusely
 unhen pataa he ki is baar sapa ke garh main muqaabala aasaan nahin he, tisare charan main 69 siton par vot daale jane hai
 In the 2012 elections, the SP performed well in 69 seats and got a total of 55 seats
 vahiin basapa ko 6, bijepi ko 5 or congress ko 2 siten or ek seat nirdaleey ko mili thi
 The comments akhilesh ne is baar is ilaake ke kai maujuuda vidhayakon kaa tikat kaat kar nae pratyaashiyon par bharosa jataayaa he
 Etawah Sadar is one such seat, from here SP has given ticket to Kuldeep Shantu
 inhen sapa ne maujuuda vidhayak shivpal gut ke raghuraaj shakya ko 'shant' karke tikat diya he or inaki cycle ke kilaaf sapa ke baagi ashish rajput lokdal kaa hal jotata kisaan lekar kud pade hai
 It is said that this is very close to Shivpal and he has come to the field to defeat SP more than winning
 aise or bhi kai sapa ke baagi hai jo tikat na milane par lokdal yaa phir nirdaleey khadey hokar sapa kaa khel bigaad rahe hai
 On the other hand, the entire preparation of the BJP is to demolish the sp's fort because in 2012, the account of the bjp's SP stronghold Etawah, Mainpuri, was not even opened
 rajnath se lekar uma bharti, amit shah, swami prasad maury, keshav maury sapa ke garh main tabad tod reliyaan kar rahe hai
 He knows that he will not get a better chance of breaking into Mulayam's fort and won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Etawah
 akhilesh yadav bhi chaahate hai ki vah party ko yahaan se jeeta kar shivpal gut ko ek sandesh den lekin ye sab kuch zamin utana aasaan nahin dikhataa he
 a lion fits very well for Akhilesh 'where did we have the strength in the loots of my own people

 ' udhar bijepi kii puri taiyaari sapa kaa kila dhahaane kii he kyonki 2012 main bijepi kaa sapa ke garh itawa, mainpuri main khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha
 From Rajnath to Uma Bharti, Amit Shah, Swami Prasad Maurya, Keshav Maurya are holding rallies in the sp's stronghold
 unhen pataa he ki unhen mulaayam ke kile main send lagane kaa isse acha mauka nahin milegaa or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone itawa se jeet darz kii thi
 Akhilesh Yadav also wants to win the party from here and give a message to Shivpal faction, but all this land does not look as easy
 akhilesh ke liye ek sher bada fit baithta he 'hamen apano ne lutaa gairon main kahaan dam tha

 srinagar se aane vaale video yahi bataa rahe hai ki enaiti ke chaatro ko kis berahami se maaraa gaya he
 The governments issued a statement telling the students to stay inside the campus as lathicharge, but when the video came out from the students, they were shocked
 kya aise bhi kisi chaatr ko maaraa ja saktaa he
 After this video, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh also had to turn from his statement that there has been a slight lathicharge
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki ham campus se baahar vaise hi nahin jate kyonki baahar to or bhi suraksha nahin he
 We have been killed within the gate itself
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay or hyderabad central uniwarsity main jab police ne karrwai kii to kai log khush the
 Perhaps NIT students will also be happy
 in sabakaa kahana tha ki ye chaatr padhai karne aate hai yaa raajnneeti karne
 The police did what was right
 kya ab yahi baat enaiti ke chaatro ke bare main kahi ja sakati he? aisa karnaa in chaatro kii maangon ke saath ninsaphi hogi
 The incident at NIT Srinagar proves that those who are supporters also have to remain silent for fear of the police
 sawaal karne kii ijazat unhen bhi nahin hogi
 By the way, why should the students who wave the flag of Pakistan have not been arrested? Is there any committee investigating him, the kind of investigation done in JNU? When will these students be arrested? a student of the NIT, who eats the police sticks, said that they protested a lot but they also did not want arrest because Pakistan is a student of life and children like us
 baad main ve khud bhi samaj jaaenge
 The interaction of many students showed that no such sloganeering or confrontation has ever occurred
 is vakt kyon hua, ye ham sabhi ko sochna hoga
 Tell the government whether it agrees with these opinions of the students? srinagar main lathicharge kii khabaren aate hi soshal media par secularavaadiyon ko gaaliyaan di jane lageen
 a few journalists began to be asked profanely, tell me what to say
 are bhai, bataanaa kya he
 Ask those who have government there
 kya ye chaar patrkaar bhi sarkaar hai to inamen se mukhyamantri koun he or upmukhyamantri koun he
 The PDP-BJP police will arrest the students shouting slogans against India or Barkha Dutt or Rajdeep Sardesai
 kya logon ne bilkul hi ankhen band kar lee yaa unhen bhi in raajnneetik girohon ke dar se ankhen kholane main ghabrahat hoti he 
 Few people started being abused as secular
 thodi to akal laga len aap bhi
 To be secular is to be constitutional
 jo secular hone ko gaali dete hai wo kisko gaali de rahe hai
 To the constitution? 24 ghante se enaiti srinagar main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke sadsy hai
 Can they now tell whether the police fired sticks on the orders of the director or on the orders of the state government? media ko campus se baahar rakhaa gaya lekin whats ap par afvaahen udayi jane lageen ki media jeenyu main to cover karata tha lekin enaiti srinagar ke chaatro ko cover nahin kar rahaa he kyonki ve bharat mata kii jai ke naare laga rahe the
 Readers and viewers should be cautious of these rumors, one day this gang will beat you when you raise a question about an issue
 sawaal to tab bhi honge jab dharti par swarg ban jayega
 The public reporter wrote that the SSP (crime) has posted a post on Facebook that the Jammu and Kashmir police do not need a certificate on nationalism or neutrality from people whose bravery is confined to the keypad
 jammu-kashmir police kii kahani tyaag or saahas kii he or isane rajya ko aatankwaad ke paagalpan se baahar nikaala he
 The police, which has been declared communal and anti-mother India by a section on social media, is saying that it has taken the state out of the madness of terrorism on the strength of sacrifice and courage
 phir bhi is police se sawaal poocha ja saktaa he ki aap itane bahadur hai to chaatro or chaatraon ko akele main gher kar laathiyon se kyon maaraa
 Why not arrest the slogans of Bharat Murdabad then? abhi tak kyon nahin giraftaar kiya he
 The students said that before this there was no confrontation between the Kashmiri and non-kashmiri students on campus
 unka kahana he ki gair kashmiri chaatro main kerala, bihar, rajasthan or upi ke muslim chaatr bhi hai jo gair kashmiri chaatro kii maangon ke saath hai
 It is therefore important that the students' demand should also be heard and debated on the same
 gair kashmiri chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karaane kii dhamkee di ja rahi he isliye campus prashasan par ab bharosa nahin rahaa
 One student said that Kashmiri students get more numbers but one said that this is not common
 kisi chaatr se anban ho jaati he to unke number kam kar diye jate hai isile ham nakaab lagaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Yet this discrimination can be proved by the number of a subject in an hour whether Kashmiri students get more numbers
 ek shikaayat he ki zyaadaatar shikshak kashmir ke hai
 It is also not difficult to find out
 agar aisa he to chaatro kii baat main dam he
 In national institutions, when the students belong to many states, why should the teachers belong to one state
 chaatr chaahate hai ki unka tabadalaa desh anya enaiti main kar diya jaae or 11 april se hone vaale imtahaan ko taala jaae
 The comments ummid he rajya or centre in chaatro kii suraksha kaa uchit prabandh karegaa
 This student is not in a position to give examination after four days in this situation
 prashasan taarikh badhaane ke bare main bhi udaartaapurvak soch saktaa he
 At least open your door to the media so that the students can speak and the media can see what the truth is
 jeenyu ke maamle main vitt mantri ne elaan kar diya ki ladaai kaa pehla charan ve jeet gaye hai, unhen bataanaa chahie ki enaiti srinagar ke chaatro ne jo ladaai chhedi he wo kis charan main aata he or wo kis tarah se jeetne ja rahe hai
 Are you going to win by arresting those who hoist the flag of Pakistan or send the students of NIT from there and win it elsewhere
 chaatro ko yah bhi chintaa he ki kahin aisa na ho ki unki maangen is masale ke raajnneetikaran or sampradayikaran main kho jaaen
 Many people were happy when police took action at Jawaharlal Nehru University and Hyderabad Central University
 shaayad enaiti ke chaatr bhi khush honge
 They all said that these students come to study or do politics
 police ne jo kiya, thik kiya
 Can the same thing now be said about the students of NIT? It would be unfair to do so with the demands of these students
 enaiti srinagar kii ghatana sabit karti he ki jo samarthak hai unhen bhi police ke dar se chup rahanaa hoga
 They will not even be allowed to question
 vaise poocha janaa chahie ki pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane vaale chaatro ko giraftaar kyon nahin kiya gaya he? kya uske bare main koi cameti jaanch kar rahi he, jis tarah kii jaanch jeenyu main hui thi? in chaatro ko kab giraftaar kiya jayega? police kii lathi khaane vaale enaiti ke ek chaatr ne kaha ki unhone khub virodh kiya lekin ve bhi nahin chaahate ki giraftaar ho kyonki pakistan zindaabad karne vaale bhi chaatr hai or hamaari tarah bachche hai
 Later they will understand themselves
 kai chaatro kii baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki is tarah kii narebaazi yaa takaraav kabhi nahin hua he
 We all have to think about what happened at this time
 sarkaar bataa de ki kya vah chaatro kii in raay se sahamat he? Secularists were abused on social media as soon as the news of lathicharge in Srinagar came
 chand patrakaron ko bhaddi gaali dekar poocha jane laga ki bataao, ab kya kahana he
 Hey brother, what to tell pucho, unase jinaki vahaan sarkaar he
 Are these four journalists also the government, then who is the Chief Minister and who is the Deputy Chief Minister
 bharat ke khilaaf naare lagane vaale chaatro ko giraftaar pidipi-bijepi kii police karegi yaa barkhaa dutt yaa rajdeep saradesai
 Did people close their eyes at all or do they also have panic opening eyes due to fear of these political gangs
 chand logon ko secular bataakar gaaliyaan di jane lagi
 You are also a little foolish
 secular hona hi sanvaidhanik hona he
 Who are abusing those who are secular, who are they abusing? samvidhan ko ? NIT is a member of Union Ministry of Human Resources in Srinagar for 24 hours
 kya ve ab bataa sakate han ki police ne diarector ke aadesh se lathi chalaai yaa rajya sarkaar ke aadesh se
 Media was kept off campus but whats up started rumors that the media used to cover JNU but NIT is not covering the students of Srinagar as they were shouting slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 pathak or darshak ko in afvaahon se satark rahanaa chahie, ek din yahi giroh aapako dharega jab aap kisi mudde ko lekar sawaal uthaayenge
 There will be questions even when heaven will become on earth
 janata kaa reporter ne likhaa he ki esaspi( aparaadh ) ne fasebuk par ek post kiya he ki jammu-kashmir kii police ko rashtrawaad yaa tatasthta par un logon se certificate kii zarurat nahin he jinaki bahaduree keepad tak hi simit rahati he
 The story of the Jammu and Kashmir Police is of sacrifice and courage and has driven the state out of the madness of terrorism
 jis police ko soshal media par ek tabake ne sampradayik or bharat mata virdohi ghoshit kar diya he vahi police kah rahi he ki usne tyaag or saahas ke dam par rajya ko aatankwaad ke paagalpan se baahar nikaala he
 Still the question can be asked to this police that if you are so brave then why surrounded the students and students in lathi and hit them with sticks
 bharat murdaabaad ke naare lagane waalon ko tabhi kyon nahin giraftaar kiya
 Why haven't you arrested yet? chaatro ne hi kaha ki isse pehle campus main kashmiri or gaiyr kashmiri chaatro ke bich takaraav nahin hua
 He says that among non-kashmiri students there are also Muslim students from Kerala, Bihar, Rajasthan and UP who are in tune with the demands of non-kashmiri students
 isliye zaruri he ki chaatro kii maang ko bhi suna janaa chahie or usee par bahes honi chahie
 non-kashmiri students say that they are being threatened to fail, so the campus administration is no longer trusted
 ek chaatr ne kaha ki kashmiri chaatro ko zyaada number milte hai lekin ek ne kaha ki yah baat aam nahin he
 If there is any conflict with a student, then their numbers are reduced, so we are demonstrating with a mask
 phir bhi is bhedbhaav ko ghante bhar main kisi vishay ke number se sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki kya kashmiri chaatro ko zyada number milte hai
 There is a complaint that most of the teachers are from Kashmir
 yah pataa karnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 If this is the case then students have a point
 rashtriya sansthaanon main jab chaatr kai rajyon ke hai to shikshak ek rajya ke kyon hon
 Students want their country transferred to other nits and the examination to be held from April 11 is deferred
 tippaniyan It is expected that the state and the Center will make proper arrangements for the safety of these students
 ye chaatr is sthiti main chaar din baad imtahaan dene kii sthiti main nahin he
 The administration may also think liberally about extending the date
 kam se kam apana daravaaza media ke liye hi khol de taaki chaatr apni baat kah saken or media bhi dekh sake ki sachai kya he
 In the case of JNU, the Finance Minister declared that they have won the first phase of the fight, they should tell what stage the fight has been waged by the students of NIT Srinagar, and how they are going to win
 kya pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane waalon ko giraftaar kar jeetne ja rahe hai yaa enaiti ke chaatro ko vahaan se hataakar kahin or bhejkar jeetne ja rahe hai
 Students also worry that their demands should not be lost in the politicization and communalization of the issue
 vaise poocha janaa chahie ki pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane vaale chaatro ko giraftaar kyon nahin kiya gaya he? kya uske bare main koi cameti jaanch kar rahi he, jis tarah kii jaanch jeenyu main hui thi? in chaatro ko kab giraftaar kiya jayega? police kii lathi khaane vaale enaiti ke ek chaatr ne kaha ki unhone khub virodh kiya lekin ve bhi nahin chaahate ki giraftaar ho kyonki pakistan zindaabad karne vaale bhi chaatr hai or hamaari tarah bachche hai

 unka kahana he ki gair kashmiri chaatro main kerala, bihar, rajasthan or upi ke muslim chaatr bhi hai jo gair kashmiri chaatro kii maangon ke saath hai
 It is therefore important that the students' demand should also be heard and debated on the same
 gair kashmiri chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karaane kii dhamkee di ja rahi he isliye campus prashasan par ab bharosa nahin rahaa
 One student said that Kashmiri students get more numbers but one said that this is not common
 kisi chaatr se anban ho jaati he to unke number kam kar diye jate hai isile ham nakaab lagaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Yet this discrimination can be proved by the number of a subject in an hour whether Kashmiri students get more numbers
 ek shikaayat he ki zyaadaatar shikshak kashmir ke hai
 It is also not difficult to find out
 agar aisa he to chaatro kii baat main dam he
 In national institutions, when the students belong to many states, why should the teachers belong to one state
 chaatr chaahate hai ki unka tabadalaa desh anya enaiti main kar diya jaae or 11 april se hone vaale imtahaan ko taala jaae
 The comments ummid he rajya or centre in chaatro kii suraksha kaa uchit prabandh karegaa
 This student is not in a position to give examination after four days in this situation
 prashasan taarikh badhaane ke bare main bhi udaartaapurvak soch saktaa he
 At least open your door to the media so that the students can speak and the media can see what the truth is
 jeenyu ke maamle main vitt mantri ne elaan kar diya ki ladaai kaa pehla charan ve jeet gaye hai, unhen bataanaa chahie ki enaiti srinagar ke chaatro ne jo ladaai chhedi he wo kis charan main aata he or wo kis tarah se jeetne ja rahe hai
 Are you going to win by arresting those who hoist the flag of Pakistan or send the students of NIT from there and win it elsewhere
 chaatro ko yah bhi chintaa he ki kahin aisa na ho ki unki maangen is masale ke raajnneetikaran or sampradayikaran main kho jaaen
 NIT is a member of Union Ministry of Human Resources in Srinagar for 24 hours
 kya ve ab bataa sakate han ki police ne diarector ke aadesh se lathi chalaai yaa rajya sarkaar ke aadesh se
 Media was kept off campus but whats up started rumors that the media used to cover JNU but NIT is not covering the students of Srinagar as they were shouting slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai

 co / lturg6jsyv purv mantri ne lagaae gambhir aropapurv mantri bikram majithia ko mili dhamkeepunjab kii jelon main band khoonkhaar gangster, police or jail prashasan kii madad se andar rahakar hi apana aapraadhik samrajya chalaa rahe hai, yah aarope hameshaa hi lagate rahe hai
 Now a jailed gangster has threatened a senior leader who was a minister in the Akali Dal government
 purv mantri ne jail mantri par sangrakshan kaa aarope lagaate hue unke saath hi sahaayakon kii kol record kii bhi jaanch kiye jane kii maang kii he
 The latest case is related to noted gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria
 purv mantri bikram singh majithia ko dhamkiyaan di hai
 Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia showed some of his posts on social media accusing Bhagwanpuria of threatening him and claimed that Jaggu was getting VIP privileges in the jail
 unhone kaha ki jaggu bhagavanpuria kii maa congress party se judi hai or panchayat member hai
 Jail gangsters are also involved in the crime
 majithia ne jaggu bhagavanpuria kii fasebuk post dikhaai jisamen usne likhaa tha ki vah jail kii salakhen todakar baahar aa jayega
 a video of the birthday of Majithiane gangster was also shown which was made in jail and also posted on Facebook
 is video main jaggu bhagavanpuria kaa janmdin dhoomdhaam se manaaya ja rahaa he
 Jaggu threatened the lion on social media
 In the last days Bikram Majithia had made many serious allegations against Punjab Jail Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa in a press conference after the murder of former Akali sarpanch in Gurdaspur
 unhone jail mantri ke gangster ke saath mili hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria has tagged the same video of Majithia on Facebook and threatened Majithia through sher-o-shayari
 majithia ne daawa kiya ki jail mantri ke sangrakshan ke bagaiyr yah sambhav nahin
 He demanded a probe into it and said that the akali-bjp government had sent Bhagwanpuria to jail in 2015 and it has been revealed from the Punjab Police report during the Congress Government that he is running a ransom racket of crores sitting in jail
 unhone kaha ki aise main spasht he ki use punjab sarkaar or jail mantri kaa samarthan praapt he
 The former minister also questioned the access of mobile phones to the prisoners in jail
 jail mantri ne kiya palatwaar, diya javabgel mantri sukhjinder singh randhaava ne palatwaar karte hue majithia par hi jelon main band gangstaron ke saath santhganth ke aarope lagaae
 Randhawa said that gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria with whom Majithia is accused of having links with him, the gangster alone has about 29 different cases registered in Majithia, the assembly constituency of Majithia
 pehle majithia in aaropon par safai den ki unke gangstaron ke saath sambandh kya hai or jab punjab main akali- bhaajapa sarkaar thi, us dauraan kai gangstaron ne jail main baithe-baithe hi apana puraa network or sindicket kaise khadaa kar diya tha
 It has also been alleged earlier that this is not the first time when gangsters in Punjab jails have been accused of running their empire from jail itself
 pehle gangstaron main aapas main hi soshal media par bayaanbaji or dhamkiyon kaa daur chalata tha, lekin aisa pehali baar hua he jab jail main band kisi gangster nepunjabaki badi raajnneetik party ke vidhayak ko is tarah se dhamkee di he
 Please tell that the North India Circle Kabaddi Federation has also been asked to take the player who had failed the dope test by threatening him
 jaggu bhagavanpuria ne apni major kabddi lig bhi banaai he jisamen aparaadhik chhavi ke khilaadiyon ko joda gaya he
 The Kabaddi Federation has also given a written complaint to the DGP alleging receiving threats from the gangsters sitting in jail
 jail mantri ne yah mana ki jail se dhamkiyaan aati rahati hai, lekin kabddi lig main drugs kaa paisa lagane se inkaar kiya or saath hi jaanch kii bhi baat kahi

 It may also happen that the current government at the center does not have a consensus on the strategy to deal with the neighboring country
 jabaki aaj agar piem kii kursi par indira gandhi yaa laal bahadur shastri hote to unke jawaab kaa tarika shaayad is tarah kaa nahin hota
 To crush terror, Pakistan would have been responded to in its own language
 jaise, 9 / 11 hamale ke baad america main aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang ko lekar sarkaar ke bich kisi tarah kaa kanfusion nahin tha
 pm's dialogue with Pakistani people: PM Modi lashed out at Nepakistan on 7th day of Uri attack
 kerala ke kosicode main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke duusare din piem apane 32 minute ke bhaashan main 15 minute tak sirf pakistan prayojit aatankwaad par bole
 a new thing in this was that he tried to communicate with the people of Pakistan
 garibi, ashiksha, berogari par lambey-chaude bayaan die
 Whereas before this, PM Modi had met the three army chiefs in New Delhi, it was expected that Modi will make some strong statements against Pakistan
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Modi said that 'I want to say to the people of Pakistan that your government talks about fighting India for 1000 years to mislead you
 main ladane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Let's fight 
 
 dekhen apane desh kii garibi pehle koun khatm karata he? berogari koun khatm karata he? dekhen pehle koun ashiksha se paar paata he
 Come fight the fight to save newborns
 ' piem ne pakistan ke logon se sidhi baat kar uri hamale par udaar pratikriya dene kii koshish kii
 Perhaps they want to show that they are different from other leaders
 amit shah ne dikhaae talkh tevarkojhicode main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke tisare dinparty adhyaksh amit shahne pakistan ko sakht sandesh die
 He said, 'the neighbor has imposed a long battle against us, but he should not consider it to be a result, if there is a halt, then no matter how long the battle is, victory will be for our army
 ' yani pakistan ke khilaaf jang ko lekar party adhyaksh ke tevar talkh dikhe
 Shah also supported the Modi government's diplomatic efforts to target and surround Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki party desh main vyaapt gusse ko mahasoos karti he
 Shah said, "if terrorism becomes part of the government policy of a country, then it is not less than war crime
 pakistan main yahi ho rahaa he
 The BJP feels the public outrage against the conspirators
 ham iskaa karaara jawaab denge
 In this way, Shah expressed the prevailing anger among the people of the country on behalf of the party
 sushamaa ke jariye diplomatic chalsomvaar shamvidesh mantri sushamaa swarajki ore se sanyukt raashtra main die jane vaale bayaan ko lekar bharat or pakistan ke avam kii nigahen hai
 It is expected that Sushma's statement will be slightly different from the stand of the government and the party and the battle is to be fought on the diplomatic front
 uri hamale ke baad se pakistan antarrashtriya manchon par khud ko is harakat ke liye jimmedaar nahin hone kii safai detaa phir rahaa he
 In this sequence Nawaz Sharif raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in the United Nations General Assembly
 pakistani pradhanmantri ne kashmir main maare gaye aatanki burhan vaani ko shantipriy bataaya tha
 Sharif's statement from Sushma is expected to give a befitting reply from the UN forum itself
 bhartiya videsh mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya he ki bharat ko jawaab dene kaa puraa adhikaar he
 Pakistan can be called terrorist and terrorist country
 use aatankwaad ko hathiyaar kii tarah prayog kar yuddh aparaadh karne vaala qaraar diya ja saktaa he
 That is, India is also working on diplomacy to isolate Pakistan through the global stage
 jab shastri ne chataa di thi dhuluri hamale ke baad bharat or pakistan ke rishte kharaab ho rahe hai
 The Indian government has not been able to take concrete action against the terrorists even after a week
 aise main desh ke purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kaa samay deshavaasiyon ke jehan main taaja ho jaataa he
 51 years ago, when Pakistan had thought of occupying the land of India, then how was Shastri, the then PM, lashed Pakistan
 shastri ko majboot iraadon or bade faislon ke liye aaj bhi duniya salaam karti he
 In the year 1965, the neighboring country tried to cross the border 3-3 times
 pakistan kii is harakat ko shastri ne do baar nazarandaaj karne kii koshish kii lekin teesri baar unke sabar ne jawaab de diya
 He gave permission to the Indian Army to enter not only Jammu and Kashmir but the border from Punjab to Rajasthan in Pakistan
 kashmir par kabje kaa khwab dekhne vaali pakistani sena ke liye lahore or sialkot bachaana mushkil ho gaya
 Eventually the UN intervenes and a ceasefire is announced
 jab indira ne tod di thi pakistan kii kamaruri hamale ke baad paidaa hae is najuk maahaul main log purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko yaad kar rahe hai jinhone 1971 main pakistan ke khilaaf aitihaasik ladaai ladi thi or use dhul chataayee
 There was a time in 1971 when something was happening in that part of Pakistan, which is now called Bangladesh, in the east of India, which was directly impacting India
 us vakt april main bhartiya pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne ek badi meeting main desh ke army chif se do took kaha ki pakistan ko sabak sikhaane ke liye jang kerani pade to karen
 They do not care about it
 disambar aate-aate pakistan ne yuddh kaa maahaul bana diya or bharat ke kuch shaharon par bambaari karne kii galati kar di
 As soon as the news of the attack was received, Indira Gandhi started working on a strategy to respond to Pakistan
 agle din bhartiya fouj ne pakistani sainikon par hamalaa bol diya
 Within 10 days, the Pakistani army was forced to kneel
 bharat ne yah jang to jiti hi, indira ne bangladesh ko alag desh ke taur par manyata dene kaa elaan kar diya
 Mamta Banerjee said, how should the laborers be killed in Kashmir? desh kii rajdhani dilli main badmaashon ke haunsale buland hai
 The latest incident is in outer Delhi, where a young man was shot and killed in a public fire near Nangloi railway station
 vaardaat ko anjaam dekar aaropee maukey se faraar ho gaye
 People gathered nearby, seeing the injured youth, informed the police about the incident
 vaardaat dilli ke aman vihaar thana kshetra kii he
 Where some unknown assailants killed Kogoli, 35-year-old Kale, near Nangloi railway station last night
 saream is hamale se aas-paas ke log bhi dahal gaye
 Someone immediately reported the incident to the police
 soochna milte hi police maukey par pahunchi or ghayal kaale naamak shaks ko aspataal pahunchaaya
 Where the doctors declared him dead
 police ne is sambandh main hatya kaa maamla darj kar chaanbin shuru kar di he
 The deceased Kale lived with his family in Prem Nagar-1
 kaale dilli nagar nigam ke dams vibhaag main karyrat tha
 Initial investigations have revealed that Black was addicted to drugs and had come from his home to talk with friends
 magar vah ghar nahin lautaa
 His family said that he had no quarrel with anyone
 na hi kisi se koi ranjish he
 On the other hand, according to police sources, Kale and his friends had beaten a young man together after abusing the Balmiki society 4 days ago
 kaale or uske doston ne us yuvak kii pitayee kaa vidiyo bhi banaaya tha
 Which was later made viral
 aise main police ko shaq he kipitayee kaa badlaalene ke liye hi kaale kii hatya kii gai he
 However, after the post-mortem at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, Kale's body has been handed over to the family
 aman vihaar thana police maamle kii taftish main jute gai he

 com / vv9sccvh5n— Michael Kronenberg (@mwkronenberg) January 4, 2019view this post on instagramit is with great sadness to report that one of our long-time clients of 16 years, Richard Marks, has suddenly and unexpectedly passed away on New Year's Day in New York i am nearly at a loss for words
 Richard began with State of the Heart Fitness back in 2005 and had been a loyal client ever since
 He was religious about his twice a week sessions, but for the past 3 months, he and Barbara were in Paris to visit friends, but also in New York, where they had an apartment
 Both from New York, originally, they would usually spend this time of the year back in NY for a few months
 Just last week Richard texted me that he was looking forward to being back and he wanted to resume his sessions starting on Monday January 21st
 i told him i couldn't wait to see him because i always loved our conversations, laughter and typical back n 'forth banter
 Richard, simply, was an amazing man
 Very quiet and modest in many ways
 
 
 yet, chances are, you have all seen some of his work as an Academy Award nominated film editor
 Some of his classic films are Terms of Endearment, Apocalypse Now, and As Good As It Gets
 
 
 just to name a few
 I'm just in shock and the tears are there
 The picture of he and i at the top of this email was back in September before he left
 It is the ONLY picture i ever took of us in all of those years
 Why this time? Why now? Did i know on something on some level? i will cherish this picture forever
 As you can see
 
 
 we were laughing like always
 I'm sure i had probably just sang him a song
 Ha! He loved (NOT) when i sang
 Actually he'd say he didn't like my singing but i know he really did so i sang as much as i could
 😜 Richard
 
 
 i will miss you terribly and i know Barbara and your family will too
 
 
 and all of your friends
 You will never be forgotten
 Thank you for letting me be a part of your life and for being a part of mine
 i am a better person because of you
 i will keep your time of 11:00 am open on Monday, January 21st in honor of you
 RIP, sweet man

 Be it a job or a business, some skills are necessary for success
 aaie aapako kuch aisi chizon ke bare main bataate hai jo har safal profeshnal kii pahchaan hote hai
 
 
 Communication capability samvaad kshamta har kaam main safalataa ke liye jaruri he
 Only people who put their point in front of someone correctly and clearly are taken seriously
 aise main aap logon main vishwaas jagaa sakenge
 Make contact kisi bhi kariyar main aage badhane ke liye netwarking jaruri he
 Being isolated from people misses on many occasions
 aaj ke samay main safalataa paane ke liye ek majboot sampark network bananaa jaruri he
 Decision making ability jaise-jaise aapaki tarakkee hoti he, aap par faislon kaa boj bhi badhata he
 At different points in your career, you have to face situations where you have to make important decisions, whether it is strategic decisions related to your company or decisions related to your career
 ye faisle hi aapaki safalataa kii dasha-disha tay karenge
 The comments netritv kshamta It is not possible to climb success stairs without a good leadership skill
 netritv kshamta kaa matlab keval bos bananaa nahin he balki jimmedaari uthaanaa or dusron ke saath samanvay banaakar kaam karnaa bhi he
 Not everyone is born with leadership ability but it can be learned
 kaam or jindagi kaa santulan Work is worship
 
 
 lekin har vakt puja main hi to nahin lag sakate
 Successful people strike a balance in their work and personal life
 kaam se sahi samay par brake lenaa, ghar main samay dena or jivan ke ahm palon kaa anand lenaa bhi jaruri he kyonki yahi aapako acha kaam karne kii urja detaa he

 Balance of work and life kaam hi puja he
 
 
 But at all times you cannot be engaged in worship
 safal log apni work or personal life main ek santulan banaakar chalate hai
 Taking a break at the right time from work, giving time at home and enjoying the important moments of life is also important because it gives you the energy to do good work
 kaam or jindagi kaa santulan Work is worship

 The play was written by Bharatendu Harishchandra, 'andher Nagri Chaupat Raja, Tke Ser Bhaji Tke Ser Khaja', sitting on the Dashashwamedh Ghat in Benares in just one day
 1881 kaa yah naatak 2017 main bhaaratendu ji ke hi banaae college main laut aayaa he
 Bharatendu ji had established a school, which later became a college and is running nowadays but is not able to run further
 ham apni bhashaa par gaurav sirf danga karne ke liye karte hai, sanstha banane ke liye nahin
 If we used to build an institution, today the condition of the college built by Bharatendu ji would not have happened
 uniwarsity siries kaa yah 12waan ank he
 Not all bhus are held in Banaras
 mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth hota he, sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay hota he
 There are five universities in Banaras district
 zile main aath sarkari college hai
 We will also know the state of the college but know a little about Bharatendu ji
 banaras main do hi to harishchandra hue
 One King Harishchandra and the other Bharatendu Harishchandra
 bhaaratendu ji kii zindagi maatr 34 saal, 3 maheene kii rahi
 In such a short span of time, he gave Hindi many ways to live
 kuch kamaal ke naatak likhe
 Bharat plight, Neel Devi, Andher nagri, Vyasya oddhashdham, Prem jogini, personal language advancement, all progress
 unheen kaa kaha hua he jiskaa matlab bhashaa ke vikaas se hi vikaas ke saare raste khul sakate hai
 But now progress, progress and progress have all been absorbed in development
 aaj jo aap hindi kahani kavita padhate hai, isaki buniyaad bhaaratendu harishchand ne rakhi thi
 The dream of changing society through journalism, women seeking rights for equality, has been given to us by Bharatendu Harishchandra in his short life
 andher nagari kii kalpana bhaaratendu ji ne sirf british raaj ke liye nahin kii thi, aisa hota to 15 agast, 1947 ke baad ye muhaavara hi mar jaataa, andher nagari chaupat raja, take ser bhaaji, take ser khaja
 This play is awesome

 Today, see the condition of the university of India, it will be the only country in the world that does not have a teacher in its class, yet the students coming there are being made to digest the world guru
 'roahu sab milikai aavhu bharat bhai, haahaa! bharat durdasha na dekhi jaai', he bharat ke log, bharatvasi, tum sab aao, milakar roo kyonki mujhase bharat kii durdasha dekhi nahin ja rahi he
 This is the meaning of their line
 bhaaratendu ji ne ek skool kii sthapana kii jo baad college bana
 The plight of that college cannot be seen, but for that the whole of India will not cry together, India will cry on the plight of the colleges and where
 aapane banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity kaa haal to dekha hi tha, aaj banaras ke bhaaratendu harishchandra college kaa bhi haal bataaenge
 The hard work is done by our colleague Ajay Singh, the presentation is mine and the ministry of visual construction and decoration of the Indian system is neglected
 collejon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bharat varsh main maanav sansaadhan vikaas matraalay nahin, maanav sansaadhan upeksha mantralay chal rahaa he
 Harishchandra Degree College is located in the plain area of banaras
 is college kii sthapana unheen kii trust ne kii thi
 The year of 1866 was to spread the importance of education to the people and laid the foundation of a school with 5 students in a house situated in Chaukhamba
 iskaa naam chowkhamba skool tha
 By 1910 it was converted into a high school and on 26 November 1909 the then Lieutenant Governor Sir John Hivet laid the foundation stone of the new building at Madagin
 1939 main yahaan intermediat kii kakshaen shuru huin or 4 aktubar, 1951 ko yah college ban gaya
 This college is affiliated with Kashi Hindu University
 1960 main gorakhpur vishvavidlaay se jud gaya
 After that this college is associated with Purvanchal University
 aajkal mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth se judaa hua he
 This is a unique college in the world, which may not have had the privilege of being like a college but has got the privilege of being associated with four or four universities
 isaki durdasha bataa rahi he ki yah ab maha vidhyalay nahin, ahaa vidhyalay ho gaya he
 The media and politics and the people of Benares themselves have done an injustice to Benaras
 saare shahar kii viraasat ko do-chaar chowk, ghat or golbanr tak main samet diya he
 This is the reason why we know more about BHU and Ghats in Benaras, while in Benares there is much more
 ajay singh ne kaaphi mehnat kii he isliye ham bhi aaraam-aaraam se bataa rahe hai ki kaisen ham sabane aaraam-aaraam se ucch shiksha ko nimna shiksha main badal diya he
 8000 students study here, imagine in the college where 8000 students study, you have seen a leader go and take a photo, ever heard the name, i had not even heard
 itnaa biechayu-biechayu hota he ki ye 8000 bhi khud ko biechayu kaa hi samajhate honge
 He does not have any agony of his own, just as every agony has the same story, capable vice-chancellor of BHU and BHU
 baharhaal 8000 chaatro ke liye is college ko 3 shift main chalaaya jaataa he
 This college wakes up at seven thirty in the morning, teaching students of arts, commerce, science and law and closes at seven and a half in the evening
 maatr 2 bidhe zamin main yah mahavidhyalay bana hua he, 8000 chaatro ke liye maatr 40 kamare hai
 Boys and girls are also in late evening shifts

 People like Tribhuvan Narayan Singh and Brigadier Usman have come out of this college
 shahar ke bichombich he yah college, magar college ke get par taxi stand he
 Trains bringing bodies from far and wide stop here
 college ke bheetar jo jagah bachati he wo motor cycle stand se bhar jaati he
 There is no playground
 yahi nahin is degree college main ladakiyon ke liye koi shauchalay nahin tha
 Last year, when Khushboo Singh became the President of the Students Union, after a lot of struggle, she built a toilet for girls
 ban jane se bharat main samasya dur nahin hoti he
 The condition of the toilet is very bad
 kuch main darvaaze tak nahin he
 Cleanliness does not happen
 harishchandra degree college main sirf shauchalay hi ganda nahin he
 Rather, the entire campus is covered with dirt as if a lab of dirt has been set up here
 college main safai karmi nahin hai
 It will not be clear from advertising
 mahavidhyalay ke principal ke paas samasya ke kaaran ke jawaab bhi hai
 The problem is not broadcast until the cause of the problem
 yah sarkari jawaab kaa tarika he
 Not a scavenger but regular cleaning is done twice
 ham samajhate hai principal sahab kii majaburi
 This problem is not theirs
 is mahavidhyalay ko chalaane ke liye karmchaariyon kii bahut zarurat he
 If you can not maintain permanent, then employees are kept at Rs 3000 per month
 100 rupee pratidin yani neutnam mazaduri se kam par
 India's problems have a quality
 zimmedaar kaa pataa nahin chalata he
 The victim is detected
 is vyavastha ne kis-kis ko dansa he, wo aap chahen to pataa chal saktaa he
 Honorarium is expected to be paid
 samaadhaan nahin he magar pradhanacharya mahoday ke paas samasya ke kaaran maujuud hai
 Colleges in India should be declared as automatic
 khaskar un collejon ko jahaan 40 se 50 fisadi shikshakon kii kami he
 The automatic college should be called the college where the student will take admission but will pass without studying from the professor, lecturer
 kaayade se bharat main fees vaapasi kaa andolan chalanaa chahie
 When the professor did not teach, what was the fee charged? bharat ke hi chaatr apana deveopment karaab kar, college ke deveopment ke liye fees de sakate hai
 Now look at the next list and ask your children that wherever you go, someone comes to teach
 jis bhaaratendu harishchan ne hindi ko hindi di, unke shuru kiye gaye skool se bane college main hindi kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 But the condition of the strip outside the department is not bad
 vibhaag kaa cameraa jarjar college ke bheetar nadi ke dweep kii tarah bachaa hua he
 The Hindi department does not have its own library
 college kaa ek samuhik pustkaalay he magar magar vahaan bhi jamaane se kitaab nahin khridi gai he
 There are books on the library rack but now they are out of the course
 iske baad bhi aap kehete hai ki main positive story nahin dikhaata
 Tell me, what can be a big positive story without thousands of children of the teacher, book, library and reading
 bharat ke college bagair shikshak ke padhaane kii prayogshaala hai
 This is why whatsapp University is more popular in India today
 ek sajjan ne kaha ki main yah series band kar duun
 Boredom
 kisi ko koi fark nahin padataa he
 May be the sayers are right, but i want to see that who does not matter
 kya aap bhi un mata-pita main se hai yaa chaatro main se hai, jinhen fark nahin padataa he
 This is a government aided college
 shikshakon karmchaariyon kaa vetan to sarkaar detii he magar college ko fees ke zarie apana vikaas karnaa hota he
 Due to the lowering of fees, other arrangements have not been made
 prisimple kehete hai ki is college main admician lene ke liye bahut craij he
 It is inconceivable that where there is no teacher, no fan in the class, there is a craze for admission or students have no way other than admission
 admician hi desh ko mahaan banaata he, ye slogan likh dena chahie
 The comments bharat kii samasyaon kii ek or khasitay he
 Many people come in the name of removing them and then after some time all those people go far away from the problem
 samasya chupchaap vahiin khadi rahati he
 The Bharatendu Trust has 52 bighas of land at a distance of ten km from here
 college ne vahaan kuch class chalaane kii anumati maangi magar anumati nahin mili
 i doubt that the people in the government have taken revenge from Bharatendu Harishchandra for why he wrote a play called Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja
 ve na likhte na duniya raajaaon ke chaupat karnaamon par hansatii
 Although the government of Akhilesh Yadav had approved to give one crore rupees, but the college could not do paperwork and this fund has not come till today
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par raajnneeti main danga ho jane tak kii sambhaavna he magar iske naam par na to teacher rakhe jate hai na unhen sammanjanak vetan diya jaataa he
 You have chosen this politics
 aapane dekha ki sanskrit shiksha kii kitni karaab haalat he, ab aap aadhunik hindi ke janak bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae skool college kii haalat dekh lijie
 By the way, today did not like presenting the report of the institute created by Bharatendu Harishchand
 kya bharat kii janata ne vaaki kasam kha lee he ki raajnneeti main sirf hindu-muslim hi chalegaa, padhai-likhaai aspataal kii baat chalegi hi nahin
 Is that really so banaras main do hi to harishchandra hue
 One King Harishchandra and the other Bharatendu Harishchandra

 itnaa biechayu-biechayu hota he ki ye 8000 bhi khud ko biechayu kaa hi samajhate honge
 He does not have any agony of his own, just as every agony has the same story, capable vice-chancellor of BHU and BHU
 baharhaal 8000 chaatro ke liye is college ko 3 shift main chalaaya jaataa he
 This college wakes up at seven thirty in the morning, teaching students of arts, commerce, science and law and closes at seven and a half in the evening
 maatr 2 bidhe zamin main yah mahavidhyalay bana hua he, 8000 chaatro ke liye maatr 40 kamare hai
 Boys and girls are also in late evening shifts

 shahar ke bichombich he yah college, magar college ke get par taxi stand he
 Trains bringing bodies from far and wide stop here
 college ke bheetar jo jagah bachati he wo motor cycle stand se bhar jaati he
 There is no playground
 yahi nahin is degree college main ladakiyon ke liye koi shauchalay nahin tha
 Last year, when Khushboo Singh became the President of the Students Union, after a lot of struggle, she built a toilet for girls
 ban jane se bharat main samasya dur nahin hoti he
 The condition of the toilet is very bad
 kuch main darvaaze tak nahin he
 Cleanliness does not happen
 harishchandra degree college main sirf shauchalay hi ganda nahin he
 Rather, the entire campus is covered with dirt as if a lab of dirt has been set up here
 college main safai karmi nahin hai
 It will not be clear from advertising
 mahavidhyalay ke principal ke paas samasya ke kaaran ke jawaab bhi hai
 The problem is not broadcast until the cause of the problem
 yah sarkari jawaab kaa tarika he
 Not a scavenger but regular cleaning is done twice
 ham samajhate hai principal sahab kii majaburi
 This problem is not theirs
 is mahavidhyalay ko chalaane ke liye karmchaariyon kii bahut zarurat he
 If you can not maintain permanent, then employees are kept at Rs 3000 per month
 100 rupee pratidin yani neutnam mazaduri se kam par
 India's problems have a quality
 zimmedaar kaa pataa nahin chalata he
 The victim is detected

 Honorarium is expected to be paid
 samaadhaan nahin he magar pradhanacharya mahoday ke paas samasya ke kaaran maujuud hai
 Colleges in India should be declared as automatic
 khaskar un collejon ko jahaan 40 se 50 fisadi shikshakon kii kami he
 The automatic college should be called the college where the student will take admission but will pass without studying from the professor, lecturer
 kaayade se bharat main fees vaapasi kaa andolan chalanaa chahie
 When the professor did not teach, what was the fee charged? bharat ke hi chaatr apana deveopment karaab kar, college ke deveopment ke liye fees de sakate hai
 Now look at the next list and ask your children that wherever you go, someone comes to teach
 jis bhaaratendu harishchan ne hindi ko hindi di, unke shuru kiye gaye skool se bane college main hindi kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 But the condition of the strip outside the department is not bad
 vibhaag kaa cameraa jarjar college ke bheetar nadi ke dweep kii tarah bachaa hua he
 The Hindi department does not have its own library
 college kaa ek samuhik pustkaalay he magar magar vahaan bhi jamaane se kitaab nahin khridi gai he
 There are books on the library rack but now they are out of the course
 iske baad bhi aap kehete hai ki main positive story nahin dikhaata
 Tell me, what can be a big positive story without thousands of children of the teacher, book, library and reading
 bharat ke college bagair shikshak ke padhaane kii prayogshaala hai
 This is why whatsapp University is more popular in India today
 ek sajjan ne kaha ki main yah series band kar duun
 Boredom
 kisi ko koi fark nahin padataa he
 May be the sayers are right, but i want to see that who does not matter
 kya aap bhi un mata-pita main se hai yaa chaatro main se hai, jinhen fark nahin padataa he
 This is a government aided college
 shikshakon karmchaariyon kaa vetan to sarkaar detii he magar college ko fees ke zarie apana vikaas karnaa hota he
 Due to the lowering of fees, other arrangements have not been made
 prisimple kehete hai ki is college main admician lene ke liye bahut craij he
 It is inconceivable that where there is no teacher, no fan in the class, there is a craze for admission or students have no way other than admission
 admician hi desh ko mahaan banaata he, ye slogan likh dena chahie
 The comments bharat kii samasyaon kii ek or khasitay he
 Many people come in the name of removing them and then after some time all those people go far away from the problem
 samasya chupchaap vahiin khadi rahati he
 The Bharatendu Trust has 52 bighas of land at a distance of ten km from here
 college ne vahaan kuch class chalaane kii anumati maangi magar anumati nahin mili
 i doubt that the people in the government have taken revenge from Bharatendu Harishchandra for why he wrote a play called Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja
 ve na likhte na duniya raajaaon ke chaupat karnaamon par hansatii
 Although the government of Akhilesh Yadav had approved to give one crore rupees, but the college could not do paperwork and this fund has not come till today
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par raajnneeti main danga ho jane tak kii sambhaavna he magar iske naam par na to teacher rakhe jate hai na unhen sammanjanak vetan diya jaataa he
 You have chosen this politics
 aapane dekha ki sanskrit shiksha kii kitni karaab haalat he, ab aap aadhunik hindi ke janak bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae skool college kii haalat dekh lijie
 By the way, today did not like presenting the report of the institute created by Bharatendu Harishchand
 kya bharat kii janata ne vaaki kasam kha lee he ki raajnneeti main sirf hindu-muslim hi chalegaa, padhai-likhaai aspataal kii baat chalegi hi nahin
 Is that really so yah naatak kamaal kaa he
 In one line of this is' Churan Khawai editor Jat, whose stomach is not digestible, Churan Saheb who eats people, the entire Hindus would have been digested chuuran police vaale khate, sab kanoon hajam kar jate'
 So avoid the thunder of power that is digging you
 aaj bharat kii uniwarsity kii haalat dekhie, yah duniya kaa akelaa aisa desh hoga ki jisaki kaksha main guru nahin he, phir bhi vahaan aane vaale chaatro ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran hajam karavaaya ja rahaa he
 'roahu sub millikai matu bharat bhai, haha! Bharat plight is not to be seen, o people of India, Indians, you all come and weep together because i cannot see the plight of India
 yahi matlab he unki is pankti kaa

 You had already seen the condition of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras, today we will also tell the condition of Bharatendu Harishchandra College, Banaras

 Nowadays Mahatma Gandhi is associated with Kashi Vidyapeeth
 duniya kaa yah anokhaa college he jise college jaisaa hone kaa bhale hi saubhaahgya na praapt hua he magar chaar-chaar uniwarsity se sambanddh hone kaa saubhaahgya zarur praapt hua he
 Its plight suggests that it is no longer a Maha Vidyalaya, but aha Vidyalaya
 media or raajnneeti or khud banaras ke logon ne banaras ke saath ek anyaay kiya he
 The heritage of the entire city has been reduced to two-four chowk, ghat and golbar
 yahi kaaran he ki ham banaras main biechayu or ghat ke bare main hi zyaada jaanate hai jabaki banaras main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he
 Ajay Singh has worked hard, so we are also telling comfortably that how we have all comfortably converted higher education into lower education
 8000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai, sochie jis kalege main 8000 chaatr padhate hon us college main aapane kisi netaa ko jaakar photo kheenchaate dekha he, kabhi naam suna he, maine bhi nahin suna tha
 There is so much BHU-BHU that even these 8000 would consider themselves as BHU

 However, this college is run in 3 shifts for 8000 students

 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye
 The Bharatendu Harishchandra, who gave Hindi to Hindi, is also in a bad condition in the college started from his school
 magar vibhaag ke baahar pattee kii haalat kharaab nahin he
 The department room is left inside the dilapidated college like a river island
 hindi vibhaag ke paas apana pustkaalay nahin he
 The college has a collective library, but the book has not been bought there since time
 librari kii rack par kitaaben to hai magar ab wo course se baahar ho chuki hai
 Even then you say that i do not show positive story
 bataaiye bina teacher, kitaab, librari ke hazaron bachche pard kar paas ho rahe hai, isse badi positive story kya ho sakati he
 Colleges in India are non-teaching teachers' laboratories
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bharat main whatsap uniwarsity zyaada lokapriy he
 a gentleman said that i should stop this series
 boriyat hoti he
 Nobody makes a difference
 ho saktaa he kehane vaale sahi hon par main yahi to dekhnaa chahta hum ki kis-kis ko fark nahin padataa he
 Are you one of those parents or students who do not matter
 sarkari aded college he ye
 The government pays the salaries of teachers, but the college has to develop its own through fees
 fees kam hone ke kaaran bhi baaki vyavasthaaen nahin ho pai hai
 Principal says that there is a lot of craze to get admission in this college
 yahi baat samaj se baahar he ki jahaan teacher na ho, class main pankhe na ho, vahaan admician ke liye craij he yaa chaatro ke paas admician ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Admission is what makes a country great, this slogan should be written
 tippaniyan There is another particularity of India's problems
 inhen dur karne ke naam par kai log aate hai or phir kuch samay baad ve saare log samasya se bahut dur chale jate hai
 The problem stands quietly there
 yahaan se das kimi kii duuri par bhaaratendu trust kii 52 bigha zamin he
 The college asked for permission to run some classes there but did not get permission
 mujhe shaq he ki shashan main baithe logon ne bhaaratendu harishchand se badla liya he ki unhone andher nagari chaupat raja naam kaa naatak kyon likhaa
 They neither write nor the world laughs at the deeds of kings
 vaise akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ne ek karod rupee dene kii manzuri di thi magar college kaagazi khanaapurti nahin kar sakaa or yah fund aaj tak nahin aa sakaa he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, there is a possibility of a riot in politics but neither teachers are named after them nor they are given honorable salary
 is raajnneeti kaa chayan aapane kiya he
 You have seen how bad the condition of Sanskrit education is, now you see the condition of the school college built by Bharatendu Harishchand, the father of modern Hindi
 vaise aaj bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae santhaan kii report pesh kar acha nahin laga
 Has the people of India really sworn that only Hindus and Muslims will work in politics, there will be no talk of teaching and hospital
 kya vaaki aisa he, This is the method of government response
 safai karne vaala nahin he magar do baar niyamit safai hoti he
 We understand the helplessness of the principal
 ye samasya unki dein nahin he
 There is a great need of the staff to run this college
 permanent nahin rakh sakate to maheene ke 3000 rupee par karmchaaree rakh liye jate hai
 100 rupees per day i
e
 less than the minimum wage
 bharat kii samasyaon kii ek khubi hoti he
 The responsible is not detected
 shikaar kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Whoever has offended this system, you can find out if you want
 maandey par dhyandey apekshit he
 There is no solution but the principal has reasons for the problem
 bharat ke collejon ko automatic ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Especially those colleges where there is a shortage of 40 to 50 percent teachers
 automatic college us college ko kaha jaae jahaan chaatr admician to legaa magar bina professor, lekturer se padhe hi paas ho jayega
 There should be a movement of fee refund in India by law
 jab professor ne padhaayaa hi nahin to fees kis baat kii lee gai
 Students from India can pay fees for the development of the college by impairing their development
 ab aap agali suchi dekhie or apane bacchon se puuchhiye ki tum jahaan jate hon vahaan koi aata bhi he padhaane ke liye

 vaise aaj bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae santhaan kii report pesh kar acha nahin laga
 Has the people of India really sworn that only Hindus and Muslims will work in politics, there will be no talk of teaching and hospital
 kya vaaki aisa he, Colleges in India should be declared as automatic
 khaskar un collejon ko jahaan 40 se 50 fisadi shikshakon kii kami he
 The automatic college should be called the college where the student will take admission but will pass without studying from the professor, lecturer
 kaayade se bharat main fees vaapasi kaa andolan chalanaa chahie
 When the professor did not teach, what was the fee charged? bharat ke hi chaatr apana deveopment karaab kar, college ke deveopment ke liye fees de sakate hai
 Now look at the next list and ask your children that wherever you go, someone comes to teach
 jis bhaaratendu harishchan ne hindi ko hindi di, unke shuru kiye gaye skool se bane college main hindi kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 But the condition of the strip outside the department is not bad
 vibhaag kaa cameraa jarjar college ke bheetar nadi ke dweep kii tarah bachaa hua he
 The Hindi department does not have its own library
 college kaa ek samuhik pustkaalay he magar magar vahaan bhi jamaane se kitaab nahin khridi gai he
 There are books on the library rack but now they are out of the course
 iske baad bhi aap kehete hai ki main positive story nahin dikhaata
 Tell me, what can be a big positive story without thousands of children of the teacher, book, library and reading
 bharat ke college bagair shikshak ke padhaane kii prayogshaala hai
 This is why whatsapp University is more popular in India today
 ek sajjan ne kaha ki main yah series band kar duun
 Boredom
 kisi ko koi fark nahin padataa he
 May be the sayers are right, but i want to see that who does not matter
 kya aap bhi un mata-pita main se hai yaa chaatro main se hai, jinhen fark nahin padataa he
 This is a government aided college
 shikshakon karmchaariyon kaa vetan to sarkaar detii he magar college ko fees ke zarie apana vikaas karnaa hota he
 Due to the lowering of fees, other arrangements have not been made
 prisimple kehete hai ki is college main admician lene ke liye bahut craij he
 It is inconceivable that where there is no teacher, no fan in the class, there is a craze for admission or students have no way other than admission
 admician hi desh ko mahaan banaata he, ye slogan likh dena chahie
 The comments bharat kii samasyaon kii ek or khasitay he
 Many people come in the name of removing them and then after some time all those people go far away from the problem
 samasya chupchaap vahiin khadi rahati he
 The Bharatendu Trust has 52 bighas of land at a distance of ten km from here
 college ne vahaan kuch class chalaane kii anumati maangi magar anumati nahin mili
 i doubt that the people in the government have taken revenge from Bharatendu Harishchandra for why he wrote a play called Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja
 ve na likhte na duniya raajaaon ke chaupat karnaamon par hansatii
 Although the government of Akhilesh Yadav had approved to give one crore rupees, but the college could not do paperwork and this fund has not come till today
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par raajnneeti main danga ho jane tak kii sambhaavna he magar iske naam par na to teacher rakhe jate hai na unhen sammanjanak vetan diya jaataa he
 You have chosen this politics
 aapane dekha ki sanskrit shiksha kii kitni karaab haalat he, ab aap aadhunik hindi ke janak bhaaratendu harishchand ke banaae skool college kii haalat dekh lijie
 By the way, today did not like presenting the report of the institute created by Bharatendu Harishchand
 kya bharat kii janata ne vaaki kasam kha lee he ki raajnneeti main sirf hindu-muslim hi chalegaa, padhai-likhaai aspataal kii baat chalegi hi nahin
 Is that really so jis bhaaratendu harishchan ne hindi ko hindi di, unke shuru kiye gaye skool se bane college main hindi kii bhi haalat kharaab he

 Huawei's subsidiary, Honor, has recently launched the Honor 9i smartphone in India
 isaki keemat 17,999 rupee he or isaki khaasiyat isamen diya gaya 4 camera he
 Apart from this, it also has many features, some drawbacks as well
 kya yah smartphone is segment kaa best he? kya chaar camaron kaa koi khaas phayda he? kya yah aapke liye vailu for mani he? isi tarah ke tamaam sawaal ke jawaab aapako ham is rivyuu main denge
 Design and Build Quality First of all we will talk about design and build quality
 is smartphone kii body metal kii bani he
 This smartphone is not very slim, but it is easy to hold
 rier panel ke upar or neeche aapako antena lines dikhengi said main nahin dikhengi
 There is a flash light in the top center of the rear panel, just below which is a dual camera module
 camere ke neeche fingerprint scinar diya gaya he or sabase neeche Honor kii branding or certification he
 The Honor 9i has a micro USB connector at the bottom and a speaker grill on the right side
 bain taraf headphone jaik diya gaya he yaheen par microphone kii jagah bhi he
 At least the bezel has been used in the smartphone and the selfie camera like Mi MIX 2 is not below but above
 camera ke bagal main flash bhi he
 On the right is the volume rocker and lock key and on the left is the SIM tray
 bild quality solid he isamen koi do raay nahin he or premium smartphone kaa feel aapako miltaa he
 The rear panel is not slippery, so you can use it easily even without a cover
 disple par pehle se hi ek protection miltaa he jise aap chahen to hataa bhi sakate hai
 The design is nothing special and there is nothing new in it
 vivo ne V7 Plus launch kiya tha dizin usase miltaa julata kah sakate hai
 Display We initially talked about having a camera in it and after that we said that it is even more special
 ji haa
 The second major feature of this smartphone is the display given in it
 isamen oled yaemolade panel nahin lagaaya gaya he, balki alsidi screen kaa hi istemaal kiya gaya he
 Screen size 5
 9 he or rijolushan phul echdi (2160X1080) he 
 Its aspect ratio is 18: 9
 iske alaava isamen 2
 5D curved glass is installed
 lagbhag hafte bhar ke istemaal main hamen isaki screen brit lagi or sharp bhi
 Being sharp, you will feel great when you see videos and photos in it
 Honor 9i main ambient lite sensor bhi he or yah kaam kaa bhi he
 Its display brightness adjusts itself depending on the lighting conditions where you are using it
 kai baar minial select karnaa padaa
 That is, it is not intelligent, but this feature does not disappoint
 kul mila kar Honor 9i main video dekhnaa kaaphi acha anubhav rahaa or vuing angel bhi acha he
 Since the bezel is low and the display is high, it is also good in terms of gaming
 kul milakar Honor 9i kii disple ko ham shandaar kah sakate hai
 In this segment, we have found its screen better
 parformansacaonor 9i main Huawei kaa apana Krini 659 octacor procesar he jisaki speed 2
 Is 36ghz
 isamen 4GB ram or isaki internal memory 64GB he
 We have tested it on several scales
 jaisaa kii aapako pataa he ham apane rivyuu main benchmark ko zyada tarjeeh nahin dete hai, kyonki kai baar isamen ched chhaad kii gunjaaish hoti he
 We tell you in the review what a common user feels after using a smartphone
 ise istemaal karnaa aasaan he or yah android 7
 0 Basic customer user interface EMUI 5 on Nougat
 1 par chalata he
 You will enjoy doing multi tasking
 ek to isaki disple shandaar he or doosraa isamen diya gaya multi task feechar bhi kamaal kaa he
 This type of feature is less available in other smartphones of this range
 hamane mahasoos kiya he ki agar aap ek saath do kaam kar rahe hai, jaise fasebuk yuj karte hue aadhi screen main utyub dekh rahe hai to bhi lag nahin karata hai
 Moving from one app to another is smooth and app switching is also very fast
 is phone ko analock karnaa to or bhi fast he
 This means that the rear fingerprint scanner given in it meets the company's claims
 scinar par finger rakhane kii der he palak jhapakane se pehle aapkaa phone alnock ho jayega
 There are some other uses of fingerprint scanners that make it easy to use
 yah smartphone heavi yuses ke liye nahin he, hamane kuch heavi game isamen khele hai
 The game has been played and we have also played, but you can see the lag and you can easily see the phone being slow
 halke mishan game yaa racing game achche se chalata he or isamen koi samasya he
 The good thing is that if you watch a lot of videos and watch movies, then you will not get any problem
 isliye bhi kyonki isaki screen kamaal kii he or videos chalaane se iske parformens main koi giravat nahin hoti he
 During gaming, the battery is down fast, so you keep this in mind
 kul milakar rosemara ke istemaal ke liye yah smartphone kamaal kaa he or agar aap heavi gaming or duniya bhar ke heavi apl yuj karne ke shaukeen nahin hai to Honor 9i aapako bilkul bhi niraash nahin karegaa
 cameranow the biggest feature of Honor 9i
 yah shaayad is price segment kaa duniya kaa pehla smartphone he jisamen chaar camere die gaye hai
 Two rear cameras while two for selfies
 ab baat karte hai kii daily ke istemaal main kya phaayde hai in camere kii
 DSLR was the specialty of clicking photos by blurring the background, but no longer because more smartphones have started offering these features
 thik isi tarah is smartphone main bhi dual camera hone kii vajah se aap bekagrind bler karke photo clic kar sakate hai
 But now the selfie from Honor 9i can also click by blurring the background, which is a good thing
 boke effect / portret mod yaa becoground bler aap chaahe to kuch bhi kah sakate hai
 This smartphone takes a little time to process such a picture by clicking
 saamne vaala aapako yah bol kar tok saktaa he ki photo clic hone main itani der lag rahi he
 Actually it takes some time to blur the background of the photo
 jaahir he yah aapako pasand nahin aayega
 But the background blurs well
 sirf becoground bler karke photography karne ke liye camera diya jaataa to baat kuch or thi
 But you use the camera more to click common photos, and this smartphone also fits in it
 lekin agar lite kam he to aap niraash ho jaaenge
 According to this segment, we found its overall camera performance disappointing
 acchhee raushnee main yah kaaphi behtareen tasviren clic karata he
 Talking about detailing, you get that too
 jaankaree ke liye aapako bataa den ki iske rier camoron main do sensor hai ek 16 megapixl kaa he jabaki doosraa 2 megapixl kaa he
 There is also a 13-megapixel sensor for a selfie, while the other is 2 megapixels
 haalanki donon hi camaron main single elidi flash diya gaya he
 Battery Life Honor 9i has a 3,340mah battery, but it does not have USB Type C
 hamaara maananaa he ki company ko isamen yuasabi tip si dena chahie tha
 Because it is slightly above the budget smartphone range and smartphones of this segment are now moving rapidly towards USB Type C
 baat karte hai bydaree byaap kii to yah aapako niraash nahin karegaa
 In mixed use, you can run it comfortably throughout the day and even when you come back home at night, there will be little battery left in the smartphone
 lekin agar aapane phone kam yuj kiya he zyada surfing nahin kii zyada video nahin dekhi to aap ise 24 ghante tak bhi chalaa sakate hai

 In such cases, the role of match referee is very important
 aise main match referi ke bare main jaananaa behad rochak hoga-is pad kaa srijan 1993 main kiya gaya
 The ICC was constantly receiving complaints from the umpires as to why they should have full responsibility for good behavior in the field
 so, usne match referi kaa pad banaaya or match ke dauraan isisi kii aachaar samhita ke paalan ke liye use captainon or ampiron ke saath zimmedaar banaaya
 There are 19 former Test players in the match referee's panel
 bharat se isamen hanumant singh , gundappa vishwanath hai
 Initially, the position was supposed to have been made "for the team's sympathy" but the ICC has now decided that it will have a panel of five full-time match referees for the next season
 is penal kaa chayan isisi adhyaksh malkam grey, sunil gavaskar or srilanka ke ranjan madugale karenge
 Many believe Dennis' attitude in South Africa was to bolster his selection as a strict referee
 match fixing prakaran ke baad isisi ne yah dikhne kii koshish kii he ki vah adhik peshewar dhang se kaam karti he
 It has also started to include players from outside the anglo-australian region in key panels
 masalan, gavaskar khel ke takneekee pahulon se sambandhit samiti ke adhyaksh hai
 Last year, the ICC also added an article related to "sportsmanship" in the manual
 isse maidan par shaleen vyavhar kii zimmedaari captainon par aa jaati he
 After its annual general meeting since June, the ICC announced a ban on wrongdoing
 match referi se sakhti baratane ko kaha gaya
 Two months ago he wore a new logo
 aaj, is vishwa sanstha ke saamne tuutane yaa apraasangik ho jane ki chunauti he

 In the event of Pakistan taking the initiative and lifting the ban on import of petrol and diesel from across the border, India can export petrol and diesel to Pakistan

 puraani kahawat he gud khate hai par gulgule se parhez he
 This saying fits perfectly with the United Nations attitude towards Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 18 saal pehle yani 2001 main sanyukt raashtra ne jaish-e-mohammad ko to aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar de diya
 But he does not consider Masood Azhar, the head of the same organization, as a terrorist
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki china nahin chahta
 Now the question is, why does China not want this? However, China is also seen standing with India after the Pulwama attack
 kandahar haijacking sirf uski rihaai ke liye kii gai
 The terrorist organization jaish-e-muhammad was formed only for the destruction of India
 jammu-kashmir sachivalay par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Then the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was attacked
 gujarat ke gandhinagar main akshardham mandir par hamalaa kiya gaya
 There was a terrorist attack on the threshold of democracy
 pathankot airbase par hamale ko anjaam diya gaya or ab pulavama main siarpief ke kaafile par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Masood Azhar is the culprit of more than 20 terrorist attacks in India in the last 19 years, the murder of hundreds of innocents and one of the most consummate terrorists in the world
 vahi masood azhar jiske sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko 18 saal pehle 2001 main hi sanyukt raashtra sangh ne aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar de diya tha
 But see amazing that even after 18 years, the United Nations is not able to decide whether the organization whose organization is a terrorist organization, should call the head of that organization a terrorist or not? Is it amazing that the organization is bloody, but The head of the same organization cannot be called a murderer
 kyonki sanyukt raashtra main shaamil sari duniya ek taraf or bas china ek taraf he
 Masood Azhar is not a terrorist because China does not want to
 pichley do dashak se agar kisi ne hindustan ko sabase zyaada khun ke aansu rulaae hai, to wo yahi shaks he
 If someone has created the most conspiracy against India for the last two decades, then that is the name and if anyone has given the most injuries to India in the last two decades, then that is the face
 lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood wo naa sirf aatankwaadiyon ke charaagaah yani pakistan main dandanaata gum rahaa he, balki china kii pushto-panaahi main lagaataar zehar bhi ugal rahaa he
 Now call it the diplomatic intrigue of China against India, its friendship with Pakistan or the mistake of taking India lightly
 china ne sanyukt raashtra sangh main aatankiyon ke is sargana ke haq main baar-baar apni raay rakh kar ye zaahir kar diya he ki aatankwaad ke maamle par wo kisi dohari chaal chal rahaa he
 Then even if this move, Hindustan is bled
 darasal, masood azhar ke khilaaf bisiyon subooton ke saath hindustan ne yuan se use aatankwaadi qaraar dene kii darkhwaast kii thi
 But China not only refused to consider him a terrorist, but also said that it is not right to hurry anyone to tag someone like this
 china kaa kahana he ki pehle bharat ke daawey kii padtaal kii jaani chahie
 Look at the fact that the Masood Azhar, which was undergoing a tumult in UNO for being declared a terrorist, the organization of the same Masood Azhar i
e
 jaish-e-mohammed, the Security Council with 15 countries, has already been declared as a terrorist organization
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki akhir china kii is chaal kaa kya matlab he? akhir itnaa kaufanaak aatankwaadi kaise uski ankhon kaa tara bana he? or akhir kyon china aisi chaalon se hindustan se bhi naaraazgi mol lene ko taiyaar he?

 This footage was shown repeatedly on TV channels on Sunday
 pakistan kii arthvyavastha beete ek saal se gambhir karj sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he
 To get out of this debt crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can provide a large bailout package along with free economic advice to the Government of Pakistan
 lekin pradhanmantri imran khan arthvyavastha ko patari par laane ke liye cricket kii 20-20 ranneeti kaa sahaara lete hue saudi arab, yuai or china jaise mitra deshon se bada karj lekar karj sankat ko taalane kii taiyaari kar chuke hai
 On his first visit to Riyadh after becoming Prime Minister, Imran Khan brought $ 6 billion and now Prince Salman of Saudi Arabia has announced an additional loan of $ 20 billion to Pakistan
 iske alaava yuai sarkaar se imran khan gopneey karj le chuke hai or karj kii is rakam kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, the government of Pakistan is also expecting some new debt from the Chinese government to get out of its debt crisis
 kya saudi arab se pakistan ko nivesh ke naam par mil rahaa nayaa karj use aarthik sankat se baahar nikaalega yaa phir yah karj pakistan kii arthvyavastha ko aise gart main dhakelegaa jisase nikalnaa uske liye mushkil hi nahin naammumkin ho jayega? gauratlab he ki yah pehla mauka nahin he jab saudi arab kii madad pakistan ke bhavishya ko andhkaar main dhakelne ja rahaa he
 Falling rupee-rising Inflation, Will Pakistan Handle Emerging Economy Imran? Saudi Arabia also provided huge financial aid to Pakistan at the instigation of the US to limit Russia's influence in Afghanistan during the Cold War
 yah madad bhi pakistan ko aarthik nivesh ke taur par mili or nateeja beete chaar dashak se pakistan kii avam bhugat rahi he
 This investment established the first factory of terror in Pakistan and the first CEO of this factory was General zia-ul-haq
 lihaaja, kya ek baar phir pakistan ne saudi arab kaa rukh aatank kii is factory ko multinational corporation main tabdeel karne ke liye kiya he or ab is emensi ke pehle siefo imran khan banenge?gauratlab he ki saudi arab kaa karj kisi desh ko muft nahin miltaa
 Pakistan itself is its biggest witness
 global reating agency mudies ek saal se adhik samay se pakistan ko karj sankat main funsane se bachane kii chetavanee de rahaa he
 According to Moody's Investors Service, the challenges facing Pakistan include high government debt burden, weak physical and social infrastructure, weak external payments situation and high political risk
 pakistan sarkaar par lagbhag 78
 There is an external debt of 46 billion dollars
 yah karj pakistan kii jidipi kaa 28
 3 percent
 vahiin disambar 2018 tak pakistan par kul bahya karj 99 billian dollar kaa he jo ki uski jidipi kaa 35
 8 percent
 is karj ko or khatarnaak pakistan kaa videshi mudra bhandar bana rahaa he kyonki uske paas videshi mudra main mahaj 8
 2 billion dollars
 iske alaava maujuuda vitt varsh main pakistan sarkaar kaa chaalu khaataa ghaataa bhi lagbhag 8 billian dollar ke str par he
 From these figures it can be guessed at what time bomb Pakistan is sitting on the debt
 sahi kaha imran, lekin bharat nahin sirf PAK ke liye morrkhtaa he parmaanu yuddh kii sochis aarthik sthiti ke bich pakistan sarkaar ke saamne china pakistan iconomic coridor (sipiisi) kaa nayaa sankat khadaa he
 According to the agreement with China, from 2020, the Government of Pakistan has to invest its share in the project and also pay interest on the loan taken from China
 vikat karj sankat ko dekhte hue imran khan beijing kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Clearly, in return for any debt relief from China, Pakistan has the only option to increase China's rights in this corridor
 iran ke saath phir khadaa hoga bharat, rupaya-riyal main ho rahaa tradegauratlab he ki iran kaa padosi hone ke chalate saudi arab ke liye pakistan behad mahatvapurn he
 Pakistan received financial support from Saudi Arabia in 1980
 is vittiya madad kaa rasta saaf karne main kuch kaarnon kaa ahm yogadan rahaa he
 First, General zia-ul-haq occupying power in 1977, overthrowing Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
 iske baad 1979 main iran kii islamic kranti or usee saal afghanistan par soviet sangh kaa kabja hone ke chalate pakistan kaa mahatv soudi arab ke saath-saath america ke liye bhi behad ahm ho gaya
 indo-pak trade becomes 6 times, just turning to terrorism, Imran! In this era of cold war, while America wanted to help Pakistan to end the influence of Soviet Union in Afghanistan, its arch rival Iran in Islamic world Saudi Arabia paved the way for financial help to defeat Pakistan
 america shah par saudi arab ke nivesh se pakistan main aatank kii pehali factory kii neenv rakhi gai or is factory se nikal rahe aatankwaad kaa istemaal america ne soviet sangh to saudi arab ne iran ke khilaaf kiya
 At present, Iran is once targeted by Saudi Arabia and America
 jahaan america raashtrapati donald trump ne purv raashtrapati baraak obama kii iran se sandhi kii kavayad ko darkinar karte hue use newclear technology se dur rakhane kaa faisla liya he
 At the same time, Saudi Arabia itself is expecting nuclear technology from the US to limit Iran's influence in the Islamic world
 aise main ek baar phir pakistan kaa mahatv donon deshon ke liye ahm he
 It remains to be seen whether Imran Khan will play the role of CEO of a multinational company of terror in the name of taking out Pakistan from the debt crisis
 kya saudi arab se milane vaala yah karj purv kii tarah hi apane saath america or saudi hiton ko saadhane kaa jariya banegaa
 If this happens, a new chapter of terror will be added in Pakistan under the garb of fighting the debt crisis and it will be impossible for him to overcome it

 ladakiyon ko lekar ladakon ke man main kai tarah kii bhrantiyaan hoti hai
 People say in moving language that girls die on money
 koi kahata he ki ladakiyon ko phaltu bakawaas karne kii aadat hoti he
 But is it really so? Let's know those 8 things about girls that every boy should know
 ladakiyon kaa man komal hota he ve ladako kii apeksha adhik samvedansheel hoti hai
 You may have seen many girls, afraid of lizards or cockrose
 yah vyavhaar unamem bahut saamaanya hota he
 Most girls are also more emotional than boys

 If girls are praised for their new dress or new jewelery then they like it very much
 choti-choti baton par khush va dukhi ho janaa unki natkhat aadat main shumaar hota he
 Most girls like to have long conversations with friends
 doston se ve dil kholkar baat karti hai kyonki apane samaaj main ladakiyon kii haalat yah he ki apane pati se bhi ve dil kaa puraa haal kai baar nahin kah paatin
 Everyone loves to laugh agar ladke kaa sens of humar acha he to ladkiyaan use bahut pasand karti hai
 Boys like to undertake various kinds of activities to make girls laugh
 prem donon log karte hai lekin aksar tohamatein ladakiyon ke hisse hi aati hai
 Therefore, most girls are reluctant to speak their heart and take more time than boys to express
 bacchon ke liye kisi 'vardaan' se kam nahin he vitamin diaksar ladakiyon ke bare main dharna hoti he ki ve unhen mek-ap karnaa pasand hota he lekin aisa bilkul nahin he
 If someone likes it then it is a completely personal issue

 But differ slightly
 unke sharir kii karypranali or purushon ke sharir kii karypranali main thodaa antar hota he

 aag kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye kadaa kanoon laane se pehle hamen kitne agnikand dekhne honge?' Maharashtra Assembly elections came on October 24, President's rule has been imposed in anbanamaharashtra on 50-50 formula between BJP and Shiv Sena
 rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii sifarish kii thi, jisaki raashtrapati ne manjuuri de di he
 However, the option of forming a government in Maharashtra is not over yet
 iske liye raajnneetik dalon ko rajyapal ko vishwaas dilaanaa hoga ki unke paas bahumat kaa aankada he
 Even then, it will depend on the Governor whether he invites the government to form government by removing President's rule from the state to form a government
 bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 24 oktober ko aae to bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko spasht bahumat tha
 But the government could not be formed due to Shiv Sena's objection to the Chief Minister's post and 50-50 formula in the government
 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ke liye rajyapal koshyari ke nimantran dene ke baavjood bijepi ne apane kadam peeche khinch liya he
 Shiv Sena could not give support letter within the stipulated limit, while Shiv Sena could not give the support letter of 145 mlas to the Governor within the stipulated time limit
 iske chalate governor ne maharashtra kii teesri sabase badi party ensipi ko sarkaar banane kaa nimantran diya he lekin samay se pehle hi rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii sifarish kar di
 The governor said that no political party in Maharashtra is in a position to form a government
 aise main dhara 356 ke tahat raashtrapati shashan lagaaya jaae
 Maharashtra may be under President's rule
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki maharashtra main sarkaar gathan kaa rasta band ho gaya he
 After the imposition of President's rule, if the Congress, BJP, NCP and any of the Congress party goes to the Governor to form the government
 or governor ko vishwaas dilaane main party kaamyaab rahati he ki unke paas bahumat kaa aankada he
 In such a situation the Governor can recommend the abolition of President's rule
 haalanki yah rajyapal ke upar nirbhar karegaa ki sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne vaali party se samarthan patr maang sakate hai yaa phir bahumat kaa aakanda dekhne ke liye vidhayakon kii parade apane saamne kara sakate hai
 In this, the political party manages to convince the governor
 aisi sthiti main rajyapal centre ko likhakar denge ki rajya main ek sthai sarkaar banane ke raste nikal aae hai, rajya se raashtrapati shashan ko khatm kiya jaae taaki rajya main sarkaar kaa gathan ho sake
 After the imposition of President's rule, if the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP now have one vote and the three parties want to form a government together, they will have to convince Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to give a permanent government
 iske baad hi rajyapal raashtrapati shashan ko khatm karne kii disha main kadam badha sakate hai

 When most countries of the developed world are troubled by the problem of aging population, India is equipped with a valuable army of youth at the same time
 visheshgy desh kii jansankhya main yuvaaon kii adhik sankhya ko ''janasankhyikeey labhaansh'' ke taur par dekhte hai
 However, for the nation to benefit from this, it is necessary that the young population is prepared with the view that it can make full use of its capabilities for the overall development of the country
 isamen shiksha ke mahatv ko katai nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Youth is often called the period of excessive productivity and enthusiasm
 yahi vah daur hota he jab yuva bhavishya kii jimmedaariyon kaa boj vahan karne kii disha main agrasar hote hai
 In this phase of life's preparation, young minds not only approach technical or professional fields but also incorporate cultural and moral values
 isamen naukari sambandhi prashikshan bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Today, the situation that India is in, China used to be in the 1980s
 usne maanav sansaadhan vikaas main apni yuva jansankhya ko lagaakar us se adhik se adhik laabh praapt kiye the
 In this context, the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) National Youth Readership Survey 2009 (NYRS-2009) has found that the growth rate of educated Indian youth in terms of overall population is much better
 haalanki 'sab ke liye shiksha' ab bhi dur kii kaudi he, or iske saath 'sab ke liye kitaaben' uplabdh karana bhi sidhe taur par judaa hua he, rujhaanon se pataa chalata he ki rashtriya sankalp ke nattejey saamne aane lage hai
 Looking at another aspect, the survey found that the spread of literacy depends largely on factors such as location (rural or urban), family income, parents' level of education and activism status
 yahaan shahari-gramin kaa vibhaajan spasht najar aata he-ucch shiksha paa chuke yuvaaon kii sankhya gaanvon kii bajaae shaharon main adhik he
 Gender differences also exist here
 natijatan, agar yuva jansankhya kii sahi kshamta ko hasil karnaa he to niti niojakon ko vyavastha main maujuud khaamiyon ko dur karnaa hoga
 According to NYRS-2009, India's youth population (13-35 years) in 2009 is 45
 9 karod kaa tha, yah 2001 kii janaganana ke hisaab se 2
 Indicates an annual growth of 05 per cent
 2020 tak is jansankhya ke 57
 4 crore is estimated to reach
 haalanki akele aankade hi kaaphi nahin he
 It is the quality of life of Indian youth that will play an important role in taking the country towards progress
 gunvattta kaa sidhaa sarokaar sakshartaa se he jo saamaajik-aarthik vikaas kii pramukh kunjee he
 Talking about literacy rate, only 12 percent of the people were educated in India in 1947, but this number reached 66 percent in 2007
 haalanki yah paanch guna vruddhi he lekin yah vaishvik ausat 84 fisadi se kam hi he
 On the other hand, the number of illiterate people is still the highest in India
 bharat main shikshit yuvaaon kii jansankhya 2009 main 33
 3 crore, 27 of the country's population
 4 fisadi hissaa thi or kul yuva jansankhya kii 73 fisadi
 If 62 per cent of the total youth educated population (20
 66 karod) gramin ilaakon main rahati he jabaki baaki (12
 61 crore) lives in urban areas
 2001 se 2009 kii avadhi main shikshit shahari jansankhya 3
 It has grown at a rate of 21 per cent whereas in rural areas it is 2
 11 fisadi kii hi rahi he
 However, the data shows that the number of youth living in villages is twice that of urban youth
 lekin shiksha ke maamle main aankada shaharon ke paksh main hi jaataa he
 Unless the government is able to bridge the gap between the number of educated, competing and dropout schools, it seems impossible to achieve the goal of 'overall development'
 aazaadee ke saatven dashak main kadam rakhane ke baavjood gramin jansankhya shiksha ke maanchitr main bahut kamjor maujuudagi darj karaati he
 Although the political goal of literacy is only to reach young children to school, very little attention is given to ensuring that the child progresses to the top of the school and later completes his college
 baton ko hakeekat main badalane ke liye is par kaam karnaa sabase jaruri he

 https: / / t

 co / 0hdvrquzmc dilli kii yatayaat vyavastha par haal hi main ai report ko dekhen to ham pate hai ki dilli main ab tak ek karod vaahan register ho chuke hai
 Today parking is one of the biggest problems in Delhi
 no parking ke board to dilli ke har ilaake main lage hai magar us board ke saamne hi kai gaadiyaan park kii gai hai
 In many places, the conditions are such that up to half the roads have been parked
 is vajah se kai baar lanbaa jam lag jaataa he
 In places like Paharganj, which is known as the busiest area of delhi, people keep half the street surrounded by parking
 aise main yadi aap ghar ke baahar gaadi khadi karte hai to sanbhal jaaen
 Very soon, parking the car outside the house will also attract a fine
 dilli sarkaar kii nai draft policy main aise praavdhaan banaae gaye hai
 The Municipal Corporation i
e
 the local body will have the right to impose the fine
 niyam todane par 2000 rupee tak kaa jurmaana lag saktaa he
 What is the provision of fine now? Currently, under the MV Act 1988 section-127, for the first time, a fine of Rs 100 for the car parked at a public place
 vahiin duusari baar main 300 rupee kaa jurmaana dena padegaa
 However, under the MV Act proposed by the government, it is being said to increase this amount to Rs 2000
 vahiin is par bipin bihari ( dipti meyar, EDMC) kaa kahana he ki isse nigam ko bahut phayda hoga
 People do not park the car in our parking lot, but due to the fine of two thousand people will start getting scared and the car will be parked in the corporation parking
 dilli ke log hai khafadilli ke logon kaa kahana he ki is niyam kaa lagu hona sahi nahin he
 This much tax is very wrong
 parking ke liye or jagah kii vyavastha kerani chahie
 However, many people are also happy with this thing because it will improve people's sensing sense
 dilli main gaadiyaan adhik or parking kam hagauratlab he ki dilli main gadiyon kii sankhya parking kii tulana main kahin adhik he
 There are only 63 parking lots in Eastern Municipal Corporation and 5882 vehicles can be parked there
 bhumigat or multileval parking kii sankhya 39 he or vahaan 3855 gaadiyaan park kii ja sakati hai
 Talking about Southern Municipal Corporation, there is a system of parking at 106 places
 yahaan 24500 gaadiyaan khadi kii ja sakati hai
 There are 7 multi-level and underground parking
 uttari nagar nigam main 95 parking sthal hai jinamein 24,600 gaadiyaan park kii ja sakati hai
 There are 8 multilevel and underground parking and 6433 vehicles can be parked there
 nigam tay karegaa parking shulkaisa kaha ja rahaa he ki dilli main abhi aisa koi niyam abhi tak lagu nahin hua he
 Delhi government's traffic minister Kailash Gehlot says that the power corporation has the power to fix the fee
 dilli main parking kaa 80 pratishat jimmaa nigam ke paas he
 They talk of improving the parking system in Delhi
 ve landan ke parking shulk kaa hawala dete hue kehete hai ki muft kii cheez acchhee nahin hoti
 People will improve gradually
 ve ant main kehete hai aaj dilli main 1 karod gaadiyaan ho chuki hai lekin parking kii jagah bahut kam he
 In such a situation, the corporation should also create parking spaces
 aise main ummid jataai ja rahi he ki is vajah se yatayaat vyavastha main bhi sudhaar hoga
 Rape is not a mild crime
 vah is myne main baaki aparaadhon se alag he ki vah ek puure samudaay kii asmita par hamale kii tarah aata he
 So any mild matter about rape hurts a sensitive man
 balaatkaar par raajnneeti bhi chot pahunchane vaali chiz he
 Unfortunately, this politics has continued continuously in the last several years
 acha hota, agar rahul gandhi 'mek in india' kii tarah 'rape in india' kaa muhaavara nahin dete
 It is a very disturbing truth to be kept in such a flat language that all its horrors end
 yah is bayaan kaa udhaas karne vaala paksh he
 But the manner in which the BJP became aggressive in the Lok Sabha on Rahul Gandhi's statement was like a vulgar scene
 balaatkaar ko lekar dikhaai ja rahi yah ati-samvedansheeltaa sadan ke baahar nazar aa rahi hoti, tab bhi iskaa koi matlab hota, lekin vah kahin nahin he
 It is known that how the police of the bjp-ruled states have long avoided arresting Asaram Bapu, accused of rape and later convicted by the trial court
 yah bhi sabane dekha he ki unnav ke bhayaavah cond ke mukhya aaropee apane vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke kilaaf BJP kitni saday rahi
 After winning the election, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj visited him
 beete hafte unke janmdin par badhai di
 No BJP leader asked his MP what is the meaning of his close friendship with the accused of such horrific crimes
 chinmayanand or nityanand jaise tathakthith swaamiyon ke saath vah party kaise udaar ho sakati he, jo balaatkaar ke kilaaf itani samvedansheeltaa kaa pradarshan kare ki ek bayaan par rahul gandhi ke kilaaf karrwai kii maang kare
 
 
 ? The heartlessness of this game running from Parliament to the street over rape is revealed when we find that Rahul Gandhi tweeted a video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in response to BJP, in which he told Delhi in 2014 ' Rape Capital '
 kya ab bhi smriti irani or rajnath singh apane pradhanmantri ke kilaaf waisi hi bhashaa kaa istemaal karenge, jaisi unhone rahul gandhi ko lekar kii he
 
 
 The The truth is that even this expectation from them is unjust towards them
 tathy ke taur par dekhen, to rahul gandhi kii baat takalifdeh dhang se sach he
 It is a repeated fact that three rapes occur every hour in the country
 lekin is bhayaavah aparaadh se ladane ko lekar hamaara puraa drushtikon jaise bahut satahi he
 In response to the mass vandalism that took place on December 16, 2012 with Nirbhaya in Delhi, a storm arose across the country over violence against women
 is toofaan kaa nateeja kya hua
 
 
 The The laws related to violence against women became a bit more strenuous, the demand for hanging of rapists became a little higher
 lekin mahila hinsa ke pratirodh ko lekar paidaa hui yah nai sajagata kya mahila adhikaron ke prati nai samvedansheeltaa main bhi badal pai
 
 
 The Actually, rape is not a solitary or single offense - it is the culmination of many disguised and obscure forms of gender discrimination - which we sometimes unconsciously and sometimes consciously ignore
 jab yah paraakaashtha aati he, to ham sihar jate hai, andolan karne lagate hai, faansee kii maang karte hai, lekin uske pehle langik bhedbhaav, purvaagrah or vaimnasy kii bahut sari shreniyon ko chupchaap bas bardaasht hi nahin karte, kai baar kushi-kushi unamem shaamil bhi hote hai
 How does it happen 
 
 ? parivaar ke rozmarra ke vyavhaar main, whotsap par share kiye ja rahe chutkulon main, filmon main or utyub par ban rahi web series main - har jagah mahila utpeedan ke anek rup mil jate hai
 Sometimes 'rape' was a taboo in our homes
 yah shabd sunate ek daraavnee siharan sir uthaati thi
 It is true that by hiding the words, covering up, not using them, the truth does not end
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki kisi shabd ko baar-baar bahut halke dhang se istemaal kar ham uski bhayavahata ko lagbhag khatm kar dete hai
 Similarly, one can recall that many of the sexist abusers were out of our public behavior
 gharon main ve suni nahin ja sakati thim
 But the web series-culture that has developed in recent times, uses these abuses in a very cruel and flat manner
 ham dhire-dhire iske abhyast ho rahe hai or langik purvaagrah ke ek garhit rup ke prati hamaari samvedansheeltaa lagbhag shunya-si ho chali he
 Aamir Khan's famous film 'three Idiots' was highly appreciated
 ikkisvin sadi main jo filmein manoranjan or soddeshyata ke mail kii tarah ain, unamem is film kaa naam kaafii upar liya ja saktaa he
 But in one scene of the film, the protagonist alters a letter and transforms 'miracle' into 'rape' and 'dhan' into 'tits'
 ek bahut acchhee film ke bheetar qaayade se yah ek kunthit hasya-bodh tha - ek biimaar qism kaa mazaaq, jisamen ek langik sadaandh bahut aasaani se pahachaani ja sakati thi
 But the whole country kept laughing at it
 zaahir he, yah shabd ko uske vaastavik aashay se vanchit karne kaa kaam tha, jo film main isliye sambhav hua ki vah jivan main ghatit ho rahaa tha
 Many such forms of female harassment are seen in different ways not only in films but also in life
 unako ham poste rahete hai or ek din balaatkaar ke khilaaf ladane nikal padate hai
 When there is no other way to understand this fight, then hangings are shouted
 isse akhbaaron, tivi channelon, netaaon or tathakthith saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kaam bhale chal jaataa ho, lekin stri kii barabari or garima kii ladaai antat peeche chhot jaati he
 This is also happening this time
 loksabhaa saansad achaanak itane samvedansheel ho rahe hai, jaise unhen kisi bhi qeemat par 'rape in india' sunanaa gavaara nahin
 If this sensitivity had been true, it would not have been so eloquent - she would have been somewhat guru-serious, she would have gone inside and tried to identify the sick spot of society from where the chain of female disharmony begins, which eventually leads to rape Reaches
 baharhaal mahagathbandhan se mukt hue nitish kumaar ke saamne ab party ke andar maujuud ansatushton ko manaane kii chunauti he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley himself has come out in defense of the government's decision to discontinue 500 and 1000 notes
 na sirf unhone faisle ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif kii balki virodhiyon ke aaropon par bhi palatwaar kiya
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the Central Government brought the Black Money Act to bring back black money stashed abroad
 hamane satta main aane ke baad arthvyavastha ko protsaahit karne ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 The Finance Minister said that the Central Government has taken several steps to eliminate the problems of Kikaladhan and to keep an eye on benami transactions
 unhone kaha ki 500 or 1000 ke noton ko band karne ke sarkaar ke faisle kaa har jagah swaagat ho rahaa he
 This step will help India's credibility
 jetali ne kaha ki shuruyaat main thodi pareshaani hogi, lekin 3-4 hafton main samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 Jaitley termed the news of the chip in a 2000 note as incorrect

 bharat main ab 'jain' samudaay ke log bhi alpsankhyak honge
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Central Government has given him minority status
 yani ab jain bhialpsankhyakon ke liye chalaai ja rahi sarkari yojanaon or kaaryakramon kaa laabh leskenge
 The people of the Jain community welcomed the decision of the Central Government, saying that it will help in preserving their religious identity, culture and heritage
 yah faisla mantrimandal kii baithak main somvaar ko liya gaya
 It is believed that 50 lakh Jain voters can play a small but important role in the upcoming elections
 ahimsa vishwa bharti acharya ke lokesh muni ne kaha ki jainon ne samaaj or desh kevikas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 This decision will further motivate them for various social welfare activities
 kendriya mantri pradeep jain aditya or jain samudaay ke netaaon ne ol india congrescor cameti mukhyalay ke baahar jashn manaaya

 Earlier, Jains had minority status in only 14 states and they were demanding it at the national level

 Suketu Mehta in his novel Maximum City portrayed him as a "bloodthirsty" officer by the name of Ajay Lal
 isi tarah ibi kaa daawa tha ki mirza himaayat beg ko german bekri blast cese main krime branch ne galati se pakadaa tha, or vineeta kamte ne 26 / 11 hamale main apane pati asipi ashok kamte kii maut ke liye unhen hi jimmedaar bataaya tha
 His supporters in the police are with him
 unke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki maaria kii poochtacha ke tareeke ‘‘krime branch unke pad vaale kisi bhi adhikari ke liye swaabhaavik hai
 They defend Maria on Vineeta's accusation and call her the victim of the then CP Hasan Gafoor's blunder
 bataaya jaataa he ki pradhan samiti kii antim report unhen nirdosh sabit karti he
 Despite all this, Rakesh Maria is a popular officer
 unhen chaahane vaale unki niyukti se behad khush hai
 We all have many things in our mind
 kuch ham dusron ke saath saajha karte hai or kuch sirf khud tak hi rakhana pasand karte hai
 But at times, keeping things in mind also becomes a reason for our concern, but it cannot be denied that only some things remain secret
 prem sambandhon or vaivaahik sambandhon main kuch bhi raaj rakhana, rishte ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he lekin kai aisi baaten har rishte main hoti hanzinhen miyaan-bivi bhi aapas main share nahin kar sakate
 These are the things that no one gets hurt by hiding
 yahaan kuch aise hi raaj kaa zikr he jo mahilaayein aamtaur par purushon se chhipaati hai:1
 Regarding old love affairs, most women feel that if they told their partner about old love then their partner would consider them wrong
 aisi sthiti main ve apane puraane relationships or prem prasang ko chhipaana hi behatar samajhati hai
 2
 ladakiyon vaali batenye wo baaten hai jo auraten purushon ke saath share karne se kataraati hai or purushon ko bhi in baton se dur hi rahane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Just as every boy shares such things and things with his friends that he cannot do with his partner, similarly women also have many secrets
 3
 Makeup box Most women like to keep their makeup box a secret
 unhen bilkul acha nahin lagata he ki koi unke mechap box main taank-jhaank kare
 They think that the snooping person is trying to find out about them
 4
 Girls do not like the family at all that their partner should taunt them about any matter related to their house
 aise main ve apane ghar se judi bahut si baaten, khaastaur par nakaaratmak baton ko partner se chhipaana hi behatar maanati hai
 In the second phase of Lok Sabha elections, 8 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh will be voted on April 18
 is daur main nagina, amroha, bulandshahr, aligarh, hathras, mathura, agra or fatehpur sikri seat par chunaav hone hai
 All these 8 Lok Sabha seats of the state are from western Uttar Pradesh
 duusare charan kii chunavi jang bijepi banaam basapa ke bich hoti dikh rahi he
 However, the prestige of Congress state president Raj Babbar is also at stake in this period
 duusare charan main jin 8 siton par chunaav hai
 The BJP won all these 8 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan kii seat shering ke tahat 6 siton par basapa chunavi maidan main utari he
 These seats are Nagina, Amroha, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Agra and Fatehpur Sikri
 jabaki hathras seat par sapa or mathura seat par areldi chunaav lard rahi he
 It is clear that in the second phase there is a political battle between Mayawati vs Modi
 nagina main trikoniya muqablabijanour jile main 2 loksabhaa siten hai, inamen se pehali bijanour he
 Nagina Lok Sabha seat is reserved for scheduled castes
 gathbandhan main yah seat basapa ke khate main gai he
 bsp's Girish Chandra is from here
 jabaki bijepi ne maujuuda saansad yashavanth singh or congress ne purv iees aarake singh kii patni omvati par daanv lagaaya he
 Both the coalition and the Congress are eyeing the Dalit and Muslim votes in this seat
 jabaki bijepi rajput or gaiyr jatav dalit ke saath-saath jat matadaataaon ko apane paale main rakhkar dobaaraa se jeet kaa paracham fahraana chaahati he
 In such a situation, a triangular contest is seen on Nagina seat
 raajnneetik samikshakon kaa kahana he ki musalamaanon kaa bada tabaka gathbandhan ke saath ja saktaa he
 Amroha: BSP versus BSP from Amroha Lok Sabha seat, BJP has fielded Kunwar Danish from JDS
 vahiin, bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad kanvar singh tavanr par daanv lagaaya to congress ne raashid alvi ke manaa karne ke baad sachin choudhary ko maidan main utaara he
 Looking at the caste equation of Amroha seat, about 5 lakh Muslims, 2
 5 lakh dalit, 1 lakh gurjar, 1 lakh kashyap, 1
 There are 5 lakh Jats and 95 thousand Lodh voters
 basapa pratyaashee kunwar danish muslim, dalit or jat ke sahare chunavi jeet darj karnaa chaahate hai
 While BJP candidates Gurjar, Kashyap, Lodh and Jat are looking to win again through voters, the Congress has also made it difficult for them by fielding Sachin Chaudhary
 bulandshahr: basapa-bijepi main sidhi ladibulandshahr seat par basapa ne yogesh verma ko utaara he
 While the BJP has once again reposed trust in its current MP Bhola Singh and the Congress has fielded former MLA Bansi Singh Pahadia
 bijepi ne 2014 main is seat par kareeb chaar lakh maton se jeet darj kii thi, lekin is baar ke raajnneetik sameekaran kaaphi badale hue najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the BJP to win again
 raajnneetik sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekhen to bulandshahr seat par kareeb 1
 5 lakh Brahmins, 1 lakh Rajputs, 1 lakh Yadavs, 1 lakh Jats, 3
 5 lakh dalit, 2
 There are 5 lakh Muslims and 2 lakh Lodh voters
 aise main basapa ke yogesh verma muslim or yadav ke saath-saath dalit maton ko bhi saadhane main jute hai
 At the same time, Bhola Singh Lodh of the BJP wants to repeat the victory with the help of Brahmin and Rajput votes
 lekin bulandshahr ke brahman netaa guddu pandit ne jis tarah se ain vakt par basapa kaa daaman thama he
 In such a situation, BSP can also breach the vote of Brahmins
 aligarh main trikoniya muqablligarh loksabhaa seat ke siyaasi sangram main basapa ne ajit baalion, bijepi ne maujuuda saansad satish gautam or congress ne choudhary bijendra singh ko maidan main utaara he
 The leaders of the three major parties are no less each other
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki trikoniya muqabla he
 However, in terms of caste equation, Yadav, Brahmin, Rajput and Jat have close to one and a half lakh votes
 jabaki dalit 3 lakh or 2 lakh ke kareeb muslim matadaata hai
 If you look at it from the point of view of votebank, both BSP and Congress have fielded Jat candidates, BJP has played bet on Rajput
 haalanki kalyaan singh bijepi ummidavaar se khush nahin he
 In such a situation, the road to victory is not easy for the BJP
 hathras sapa banaam bijepihatharas loksabhaa seat sapa ke khate main gai he or sapa ne purv kendriya mantri ramjilaal suman ko maidan utaara he
 At the same time, BJP has fielded Rajvir Singh Balmiki and Congress has fielded Trilokiram Diwakar
 haalanki yah seat jat bahul maani jaati he
 About 3 lakh Jats, 2 lakh Brahmins, 1 on this seat
 5 lakh rajput, 3 lakh dalit, 1
 5 lakh bagels and 1
 25 lakh muslim matadaata hai
 According to political experts, there is a contest between SP vs BJP on this seat
 agra: bijepi-basapa ke bich jangagara loksabhaa seat anusuchit jaati ke liye arakshit he
 On this seat, BSP has fielded Manoj Soni, BJP SP SP Baghel and Congress Preeta Harit
 bijepi ke espi baghel sapa or basapa main rah chuke hai, aise main muslim matadaataaon main acchhee khaasi pakad he
 In this way, along with BJP, Baghel is able to manage the vote bank of other parties, then once again the lotus can blossom
 haalanki basapa kaa ye purana ilaaka rahaa he aise main basapa ko bhi is kshetra se badi ummiden he, lekin congress pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar bhi is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, they too have their own base
 mathura main areldi banaam bijepimathura loksabhaa seat gathbandhan main areldi ke khate main gai he
 The BJP has once again fielded Hema Malini
 jabaki, areldi ne is seat par kunwar narendra singh or congress ne mahesh pathak ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 This seat is considered to be Jat dominated and has about 4 lakh Jat voters
 jabaki 2
 5 lakh Brahmins and 2
 5 lakh rajput voter bhi hai
 There are as many Dalit voters and close to two and a half million Muslims
 aise main agar areldi ummidavaar rajput ke saath-saath jat muslim or daliton ko saadhane main kaamyaab rahete hai to bijepi ke liye ye seat jeetna lohe kii chane chabane jaisaa ho jayega
 Fatehpur Sikri: The triangular Fatehpur Sikri Lok Sabha seat has gone to the bsp's account under the alliance
 basapa ne yahaan se guddu pandit ko utaara he
 Whereas BJP has cut the ticket of its sitting MP Babulal Chaudhary to Rajkumar Chaher
 vahiin, congress se pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar maidan main he
 Here the candidates of all the three parties are considered very strong
 aise main trikoniya ladaai hone kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 Who will be India's number four batsman in the World Cup? Former South African captain Capler Vessels has also joined this discussion that has been going on for some time and he believes that captain Virat Kohli should get to bat at this important place
 vaisals ne iske saath hi mana ki dakshin africa ‘chokars’ ke tamge kaa hakdaar he or jab tak vah isisi kaa koi bada toornament nahin jeet jaataa tab tak us par yah tamgaa laga rahegaa
 He said, 'I think Virat Kohli will be the most suitable batsman for the number four position
 vah is sthaan par utarkar pari ko sanvaar sakate hai or jarurat padane par teji se ran bhi bana sakate hai
 Number four may be the ideal place for them
 'kohli haalanki number chaar par khaas safal nahin rahe hai
 In his career so far he has landed at this position in only 38 matches while number three is his favorite spot at which he has landed for batting in 166 matches

 Former Australian fast bowler Andy Bickel, however, admitted that India had several options for number four, but he felt KL Rahul might be the most suitable player for this position
 bikel ne kaha, 'rahul abhi acchhee farm main he or number chaar kii jimmedaari acchhee tarah se nibhaa saktaa he
 The team has Mahendra Singh Dhoni who can bat at any place from number one to six
 vijay shankar yuva pratibhashali ballebaaj he
 Overall, India has a choice of number four
 yah team prabandhan ke liye acha saradard he
 Vessels called India a strong contender for the title
 unhone uske alaava england or australia ko bhi semifinal main pahunchane kaa hakdaar bataaya
 He said, 'india has a very good chance of winning
 uski team vanade main bahut acchhee he
 England can also be a dangerous team but their players have to play in front of the home audience and they have to control their emotions
 'vaisals ne kaha, 'australia teesri team he jisaki acchhee sambhaavna he
 Till two months ago, Australia had no possibility but now their strongest team is playing
 in teenon ke alaava semifinal kii chauthi team dakshin africa, newjiland or pakistan main se koi ek ho sakati he
 Vessels, who played for both Australia and South Africa, said that the South African team would not lose track of the chokers until they won the big tournament
 unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, 'haa jab tak ve isisi kaa koi bada toornament nahin jeet jate hai tab tak un par yah ‘tamgaa’ laga rahegaa
 They deserve this title

 Vessels said, "there are a lot of expectations from the team in South Africa but this time around the world they are not expecting that much
" unhen khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar nahin mana ja rahaa hai
 He will start as an underdog but his team has some good cricketers and the team is balanced
 'unhone haalanki kaha ki team ko abi divilliars kii kami khalegi jinhone antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le liya he
 Vessels said, "AB can prove to be important for any team and i think his absence in the team is a big setback for South Africa

 netsalabamjika manisha kulshreshth kaa apekshaakrit chota upanyaas he
 There is complexity in the relationship of men and women in which the demand is born
 bhavishya ke khushnuma taar uljhe hai, jinhen donon sulajhaate hai, jhallaate hai or bich main chhodkar uth jate hai
 It is a relation of the need of both mind and body
 ve sambandhon main bhavukta ke khilaaf hai
 Still, the man wants the body of the woman to be laid like a board in front of him and he should play this fun game with interestingness
 upanyaas ke do frem hai-ek stri kaa; doosraa purush kaa
 Manisha is trying to break both frames
 sawaal he ki stri ke nazariye ko jis eemaandaaree se ek lekhika prastut kar sakati he, kya vah purush nazariye ko bhi usee eemaandaaree se parakhegi? manisha ne is sawaal ko badi chaturaai se saadhaa he
 Created in the autobiographical style, this novel places man from the perspective of man and woman from woman's perspective
 purush centre main he or stri uski poorak
 Despite being complementary, she has so much potential that she can fit into a man and also be free from him in the very next moment
 stri-purush kaa yah jatil sambandh upanyaas ke kathanak kii visheshta he
 The protagonist Chetan wants to make a film based on his old girlfriend Padma
 iske jariye use apana khalipan bharna he
 For the role of Padma, she chose Grashel, who brings Padma alive not only in the character but also in Chetan's mind
 padma-chetan grashell ke rishte stri-purush ke badalte rishton kii kahani kehete hai
 Relationships in the novel are 'past', there are memories, present is also but future is missing
 shaayad tay nahin ki stri-purush ke sambandhon kaa bhavishyon kya hoga
 The past sits like nostalgia — both in man and woman, the culmination of which is artistic
 baavjood iske vartmaan prabhavit he ateet or smritiyon se
 Grashel's present repeatedly clashes with Padma's past
 chetan kaa grashell main padma ko khojna, jhallaata he grashell ko
 She says, "you are not able to change my inner being, why bother?" I'm not Padma
 nahin karata kuch bhi match uskaa or meraa
 "gruchel, who runs away from seclusion, has to grapple with the question of monotony
" deh ke sawaalon se vah upar uth chuki he
 The body is his personal property, not a matter of reverence
 ateet uske deh ko ab daag nahin saktaa or vartmaan to uskaa he hi
 Manisha is clear on the matter and so is her Grashel and Padma
 upanyaas main sarvaadhik aakarshith karata he-bhashaa kaa kasaav
 The language looked very mature in moments of spiritual and physical relationships
 manisha kii bhashaa or kehane kaa andaaj hi unhen auron se alag karata or behatar banaata he
 This week, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel went to Delhi, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and then discussions started all over Delhi and Gujarat that the Chief Minister was being changed in Gujarat
 jabaki sachai ye thi ki anandiben rajya main sookhe kii sthiti par charchaa ke liye pradhanmantri se milin thim
 Did it spark without any spark that Anandiben is being replaced
 ye baat sach he ki dilli main bhaajapa ke kisi varisht netaa ne hi ye baat failaai hogi varna media main ye hawa nahin uthati
 After all, who wants to destabilize Anandiben and why
 aaiye aapako gujarat kii raajnneeti ke kuch aise tathyon se parichit karavaaen jisase ye to kam se kam saaf ho jayega ki gujarat bhaajapa main sabakuch thik nahin he isliye ye charchaa lagaataar chalati rahi he
 The discussion about the removal of Anandiben Patel has not arisen for the first time
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi jab desh ke pradhanmantri bane tabhi se gujarat main unke naiysargik uttaradhikari ke taur par unke chahete amit shah ko dekha ja rahaa tha
 Most people in the Gujarat BJP believed that Amit Shah would take over the throne of Gujarat after Modi
 lekin narendra modi ye nahin chaahate the or wo amit shah ko hataa bhi nahin sakate the, aakhir amit shah hameshaa se hi narendra modi ke sabase kareebi logon main se rahe hai
 Also, among the most trusted allies of Narendra Modi, besides Amit Shah, was Anandiben Patel
 lekin maze kii baat thi ki amit shah or anandiben ke bich kabhi nahin bani
 Both were always in danger from each other
 isliye donon ko narendra modi ko sanbhaalanaa tha
 So Anandiben sat on the throne of Gujarat and Amit Shah was told to be active in national politics and also assured that he would be the new national president of the party
 baahar sabakuch thik dikhe isliye anandiben ke naam kaa prastaav bhi karavaaya amit shah se
 Modi shot two birds with one stone
 amit shah naaraazgi ke baavjood maan gayi, sanket achche gayi or amit shah ke gujarat se dur rahane kii vajah se anandiben kii mushkilen kam raheen
 But not only Amit Shah, most of the people in the party were angry with Anandiben
 anandiben swabhaav se thodi bebaak hai, kisi kii baat janchi nahin to rajnatik nahin ekadam bold jawaab de detii hai
 Therefore, ever since Anandiben became the Chief Minister, there was discontent against him in the BJP but Narendra Modi was the choice, so no one dared to openly oppose him
 isliye sabase pehle unke khilaaf campan kiya gaya ki wo budhi ho gai hai or unhen cancer ho gaya
 Nobody discussed it openly, but whenever there were hidden things, it started being discussed
 baat yahaan tak bad gai ki swasthya kii vajah se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Anandiben, since it was not an open discussion, never talked about it
 lekin wo din main 15-16 ghante kaam karti raheen
 The answer was simple, can a sick man do so much work
 tab dinesh sharma gujarat ke prabharee the
 Despite all the discussion reached here that Dinesh Sharma had to say that the talk of changing Anandiben is meaningless and she is doing a great job
 virodhiyon ke munh kuch dinon ke liye chup ho gayi
 But then in August last year, the Patidar movement started
 prachaar aisa kiya gaya ki anandiben patidaaron se samaadhaan nahin chaahatin isliye wo andolan chalane nahin de rahi hai
 a day before the big Patidar rally, Anandiben made it clear by giving advertisements in newspapers that it was not possible to give them reservation according to the constitution
 usee saal disambar main sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main virodhiyon ko ummid thi ki anandiben buree tarah haar sakati hai
 The BJP lost but completely dominated the cities in its stronghold, only in rural areas
 virodhiyon ko phir mauka nahin mila
 But there have been some incidents in the last few days which again aired this discussion
 sabase pehle 29 april ko bhaajapa ke adhyaksh amit shah gujarat aaye
 Shah, Anandiben and state president Vijay Rupani met at BJP headquarters
 meeting ke baad roopaani ne press conference karke 10 pratishat aarthik savarna pichhadon ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anandiben Patel sat next
 haalanki ye faisla sarkari hona chahie tha lekin roopaani kii ghoshnaa ke baad laga ki power shift ho rahaa he
 But the point was that Anandiben Patel still did not agree with this decision, but there was no scope of protest after Narendra Modi's green signal
 isliye khud ghoshnaa se bachati raheen
 On whatsapp, messages started circulating without a name that there is a change of power in Gujarat
 virodhiyon ne kabhi khandan nahin kiya
 Rupani is considered to be the Amit Shah camp, so not to deny it is to air it in a way
 isliye somvaar ko anandiben narendra modi se milane gayi sookhe par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel, Health Minister of Gujarat, went to Delhi to discuss the issue of NEET exam
 nitin patel amit shah se bhi mili
 Amit Shah's close friends added this and sparked discussion that Nitin Patel could become the new chief minister
 tippaniyan Everyone is saying that Amit Shah no longer wants to become the Shah of Gujarat
 baat ye rakhi jaati he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke aage 10 mukhyamantri line lagaate hai, aakhir amit shah mukhyamantri kyon bananaa chahenge
 But no one has the answer to why Amit Shah wants to remain a minor MLA of Gujarat
 jabaki wo vidhansabha main bhi maujuud nahin rahete
 Only one day comes in the budget session for the whole year
 vajah saaf he, amit shah ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke icchhuk hai
 All these discussions have been put to rest by Anandiben himself
 lekin anandiben se pehle narendra modi ne khud unke kaam kaa bakhaan karte hue twit karke ye jaahir kar diya he ki wo ab bhi modi kii bharosemand hai
 In such a situation, the opposition in BJP will continue against Anandiben, but he is finding it difficult to do harm
 haa, lekin 2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Winning in Gujarat is also important for Modi
 isliye vivaad chalate rahen to party ke parformens par asar pads saktaa he
 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he
 Let us introduce you to some such facts of Gujarat politics, which will at least make it clear that everything is not right in Gujarat BJP, so this discussion has been going on continuously
 anandiben patel ke hathaaye jane kii charchaa pehali baar nahin uthi he
 When Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, his favorite Amit Shah was seen in Gujarat as his natural successor
 gujarat bhaajapa main zyaadaatar log ye maanate the ki amit shah hi modi ke baad gujarat kii gaddi sanbhaalenge
 But Narendra Modi did not want this and he could not even remove Amit Shah, after all Amit Shah has always been one of the people closest to Narendra Modi
 saath hi narendra modi kii sabase bharosemand sahyogiyon main amit shah ke alaava thim anandiben patel
 But it was interesting that Amit Shah and Anandiben never existed
 donon ko hameshaa se hi ek duusare se khatra tha
 Therefore, both had to handle Narendra Modi
 lihaaza anandiben gujarat kii gaddi par baithi or amit shah ko kaha gaya rashtriya raajnneeti main sakriy rahane ko or ye bhi bharosa diya gaya ki wo party ke nae rashtriya adhyaksh honge
 Everything looked fine outside, so Anandiben's name was also proposed to Amit Shah
 ek tir se do shikaar kiye modi ne
 Amit Shah agreed despite the resentment, the signs went well and Anandiben's problems were less because of Amit Shah's stay away from Gujarat
 lekin sirf amit shah hi nahin party main zyaadaatar log anandiben se khafa the
 Anandiben is a bit impassable by nature, she gives a very bold answer to anyone else, not political
 isliye anandiben jab se mukhyamantri baniin, bhaajapa main unke khilaaf asantosh rahaa lekin narendra modi kii pasand thim isliye kisi kii khulkar virodh karne kii himmat nahin thi
 Therefore, the first campaign against her was that she had become old and had cancer
 iske bare main kisi ne khule taur par charchaa nahin kii lekin jab bhi chuphi baaten hoti thim to isaki charchaa hone lagi
 It has even increased that they can be removed due to health
 anandiben ne chunki ye khuli charchaa nahin thi, kabhi is par baat nahin kii
 But she kept working for 15-16 hours a day
 jawaab saaf tha, kya koi biimaar aadmi itnaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Dinesh Sharma was then in charge of Gujarat
 sabhi ke baavjood charchaa yahaan tak pahunchi ki dinesh sharma ko kahana padaa ki anandiben ko badalane kii baaten nirarthak hai or wo bahut acha kaam kar rahi hai
 Opponents' faces fell silent for a few days
 lekin phir pichley saal agast main patidaar andolan shuru hua
 The propaganda was done that Anandiben does not want a solution from the Patidars, so she is not letting the movement go
 patidaaron kii badi raily ke ek din pehle hi anandiben ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar saaf kar diya ki unhen aarakshan dena samvidhan ke mutabik sambhav nahin
 In December of the same year, in the election of local bodies, the opponents were hopeful that Anandiben could be defeated badly
 bhaajapa haari lekin sirf gramin ilaakon main, apane garh main shaharon main puri tarah haaavee raheen
 Opponents did not get a chance again
 lekin pichley kuch dinon main kuch ghatnaayen huin jisane phir is charchaa ko hawa di
 BJP President Amit Shah first came to Gujarat on 29 April
 shah, anandiben or pradesh adhyaksh vijay roopaani kii baithak hui bhaajapa mukhyalay main
 After the meeting, Rupani announced a reservation for 10 percent economic upper castes at a press conference
 anandiben patel bagal main baithi
 Although this decision should have been official, but after Rupani's announcement, the power shift was happening
 lekin baat ye thi ki anandiben patel ab bhi is faisle se sahamat nahin thim, lekin narendra modi ke green signal ke baad virodh kii gunjaaish nahin thi
