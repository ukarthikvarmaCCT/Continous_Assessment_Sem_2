 " gujarat main pichley 22 saal main chunaav main pehali baar mil rahi kadi takkar se bhaajapa, rajya kii janata se koi bhi vaada kar paane main hichak rahi he
 On this, the party is divided into two parts on ideological basis
 ek dhada chunavi ghoshnaa-patr yaa vijan document jari karne ke paksh main he, to doosraa dhada bina kisi vaade ke chunaav main janaa chaah rahaa he
 The top leadership has not been able to take a decision in this matter
 pehle charan kaa chunaav prachaar 7 disambar ko khatm ho rahaa he or abhi tak party ghoshnaa-patr yaa vijan document jari nahin kar saki he
 What is the reason? The party was earlier in favor of issuing the manifesto, but the top leadership believed that this would give the Congress a chance to attack the state government
 congress yah kah sakati he ki 22 saal ke baad bhi bhaajapa abhi tak vaada hi kar rahi he ki satta main aane par wo kya karegi
 Sources say that this argument has been accepted
 phir yah tay kiya gaya ki ghoshnaa-patr kii jagah vijan document jari kiya jaae
 Consent was reached, but then there was a hindrance in it as well
 tark yah diya gaya ki vijan document main chunki time frem nahin hota aise main congress kii ghoshnaa patr jari hone se bhaajapa kaa vijan document halkaa lagegaa
 Sources say that now the Chief Minister and his supporters are wishing that the vision document be released today, while the Deputy Chief Minister's supporters are wishing that instead of releasing the vision document in the election, the face of the Chief Minister should be declared, so that the message It is clear that the face that has been projected, with which thinking it is going to work, how much grip it has on the ground and how capable it is to work
 ye antar he vijan document auki ghoshnaa patr menghoshnaa patr 5 saal ke liye hota he
 Under the Representation of the People Act, Section 123, a political party can make a promise to the people, but the promise should be in accordance with the legislation of the state concerned, be reasonable in the extent of the state's economic resources
 yadi aisa nahi he to wo bhrasht aacharan kii seemaa main aa saktaa he
 For example, a promise to the public to give gold chains, etc
 vijan document samay seemaa se bandhaa nahin hota he
 In this, only a blueprint of how to make the state in the future is kept
 isamen kaha ja saktaa he ki 10 saal baad rajya ko aarthik rup se kahaan le janaa he
 It does not have to be related to the existing resources of the state
 ek tarah se vijan document lok pratinidhatv adhinium kii dhara 123 ke tahat badhyakaari nahin he

 According to the newspaper report, Tyagi helped Augusta Westland by changing the technical parameters

 The upheaval that is going on in Uttar Pradesh's politics, especially within the Samajwadi Party, even if it does not have an immediate impact on the politics of Bihar, but Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Prasad Yadav is under stress
 darasal, lalu yadav kii chintaa is baat ko lekar nahin he ki unke bich-bachaav ke prayaas or daawey dhare ke dhare rah gaye, lekin akhilesh ne jis tarah satta or party par kabza jamaaya hai or raajnneeti main lambii rekha khinchate ja rahe hai
 
 
 This is a cause for concern for Lalu
 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki lalu or mulaayam singh yadav raajnneeti main ek hi jati ke hone ke baavjood apane raajnneetik shikhar par ek-duusare ke kattar virdohi rahe
 The political acrimony between the two can be gauged from the fact that Lalu lost his efforts on Mulayam Singh's hope of becoming Prime Minister
 haalanki lalu ne ise baad ke dinon main apni galati maanate hue maafi bhi maangi thi, lekin ye khatas varshon baad lalu kii sabase choti beti lakshmi kii shaadi se kam hui, jisaki shaadi mulaayam singh yadav ke bade bhai ke pote tej pratap singh ke saath hui
 Tej Pratap is also an MP from Samajwadi Party's Mainpuri
 ye baat alag he ki is sambandh ke baavjood jab lalu or nitish ne mulaayam singh yadav ke samaajawaadee party main vilay kii ghoshnaa kii or ramgopal yadav ne akele is vilay ko rokane main kamyaabi pai thi tab ye mana gaya ki lalu kii bhi maun sahmati thi
 But Lalu has a problem that for the next few days he will have to decide which faction of the Samajwadi Party, which is divided into two factions, lives with
 chaahe wo akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party ho yaa shivpal kii
 
 
 It will not be easy for Lalu to stand in support of anyone
 haalanki unki koshish hogi, jahaan unke damaad ke kadam hon, uske saath rahanaa hi unke liye behatar hoga
 Currently, according to reports from Lucknow, Tej Pratap is with Akhilesh Yadav, so it is his compulsion not to stand behind Mulayam Singh
 yaheen se lalu yadav kii asal mushkil shuru hoti he
 Actually, Lalu Yadav knows that even though Akhilesh Yadav has shown his father the way to the guide board, one thing is clear from the mind and mood of Akhilesh so far that he is from any criminal, Bahubali to run the government and the party
 Do not want to have any kind of relationship
 
 Even if he comes from any caste or religion
 is aadhaar par lalu ko maaloom hai ki unke party main ek nahin darjan bhar log aise hai, jis par akhilesh jaise netaa sambandhi hone ke aadhaar par nazarandaaj nahin karne vaale
 Lalu knows that Nitish Kumar has a compulsion to have political relations with him in the name of opposing Modi, but there is no such compulsion for Akhilesh and then Lalu will have to take a decision in the future to future politics with Akhilesh Do or bow down before your party's musclemen
 haalanki jab bhi unki party ke kisi netaa bhale hi wo shahabuddin ho yaa rajbhallav yadav
 
 unke khilaaf nitish sarkaar ne karrwai kii, tab lalu ne maun rahakar sarkaar bachaana zyada behatar samajha
 The comments lekin lalu yadav kii asal dikkat is baat ko lekar he ki ab har din bihar ke unke samarthakon main akhilesh charchaa kaa centre rahenge or yahaan unke donon bete tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ke 'parformens' par charchaa kendrit hogi
 Akhilesh is at the center of discussion all over the country today, then his work has been the mainstay and Lalu Yadav himself knows that everyone knows that leave Akhilesh despite his sons department being remote, but before Nitish Kumar His tenure has not been worth comparing even to BJP ministers
 filhal lalu yadav ne apane donon beto ke hisse main aath vibhaag rakhe hai or kai vibhaag ke daftar main bhi unke bete tejpratap yadav maheenon nahin jate
 Tej Pratap's absence in the program of his department is also a matter of discussion
 up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav apane ek vibhaag path nirmaan main ruchi to lete hai, lekin anya vibhaagon ke kaamkaaj main jitna soshal media main unki sakriyata rahati hai, utani kabhi nahin dekhi gai
 Lalu Yadav himself also openly interferes with the functioning of most departments
 jo aaj kii taarikh main akhilesh brands kii raajnneeti or kaamkaaj kii style se kahin bhi mail nahin khaataa
 However, more than Lalu, his sons will now have to choose one of the political brands Lalu and Akhilesh
 brands lalu kaa anusaran kar wo satta main ek had tak ja sakate hai, lekin brands akhilesh ko apanaakar wo khaskar tejasvi yadav apane jivan kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ko puraa kar sakate hai
 
 anyathaa bihar main brands nitish tab tak chalata rahegaa jab tak wo satta main bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 It is not hidden from anyone that Lalu and Mulayam Singh Yadav, despite being of the same caste in politics, were strongly opposed to each other at their political peak
 donon ke bich raajnneetik katutaa kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa hai ki lalu ne mulaayam singh ke pradhanmantri banane kii ummid par apane prayaas se pani pher diya tha
 Though Lalu had apologized in later days, believing it to be his fault, it fell short years later from the marriage of Lalu's youngest daughter Lakshmi, who was married to Tej Pratap Singh, grandson of Mulayam Singh Yadav's elder brother
 
 tej pratap samaajawaadee party ke mainpuri se saansad bhi hai
 It is different that despite this relationship, when Lalu and Nitish announced the merger of Mulayam Singh Yadav with the Samajwadi Party and Ram Gopal Yadav alone managed to stop this merger, it was assumed that Lalu also had a silent consent
 lekin lalu kii pareshaani he ki filhal unhen agle kuch dinon main ye nirnay lenaa hoga kii do dhadon main banty samaajawaadee party ke kis dhade ke saath wo rahete hai
 Whether it is Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party or Shivpal's
 
 
 lalu ke liye kisi ke samarthan main khadey hona utana aasaan nahin hoga
 Though he will try, where his son-in-law steps in, it will be better for him to stay with him
 filhal lakhanu se khabaron ke anusaar tej pratap, akhilesh yadav ke saath hai, isliye mulaayam singh ke peeche na khadey rahanaa ab unki majaburi he
 This is where Lalu Yadav's real difficulty begins
 darasal, lalu yadav ko maaloom he ki bhale akhilesh yadav ne apane pita ko maardarshak mandal kaa rasta dikhaa diya ho, lekin ab tak ke akhilesh ke man or mizaaj se ek cheez saafe he ki wo sarkaar or party chalaane ke liye kisi apradhi, bahubali se kisi tarah kaa sambandh nahin rakhana chaahate
 
 bhale hi wo kisi jati yaa dharm se aata ho
 On this basis, Lalu knows that there are not a dozen people in his party, on whom the leaders like Akhilesh are not related to being ignored
 lalu jaanate hai ki nitish kumaar ke liye modi virodh ke naam par unke saath raajnneetik sambandh rakhane kii majaburi ho, lekin akhilesh ke liye aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he or tab lalu ko der-saver ye nirnay lenaa hoga ki wo akhilesh ke saath bhavishya kii raajnneeti karte hai yaa apni party ke bahubaliyon ke saamne natmastak rahete hai
 However, whenever a leader of his party, whether it is Shahabuddin or Raj Bhallav Yadav
 
 Nitish government took action against them, then Lalu thought it better to save the government by keeping silent
 tippaniyan But the real problem of Lalu Yadav is that now every day, Akhilesh will be the center of discussion among his supporters of Bihar and here the discussion will be focused on the 'performance' of his two sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav
 akhilesh aaj puure desh main charchaa ke centre main hai, tab unka kaam mukhya aadhaar rahaa hai or lalu yadav khud bhi jaanate hai ki sab jaanate hai ki apane beton ke vibhaag kaa remote unke paas rahane ke baavjood akhilesh ko chhodie, lekin nitish kumaar ke purv ke bijepi ke mantriyon se bhi tulana karne ke laayak unka kaarykaal nahin rahaa he
 At present, Lalu Yadav has kept eight departments in his two sons and his son Tejapratap Yadav does not go for months in many department offices
 apane vibhaag ke kaarykram main bhi tejpratap kaa nadaarad rahanaa charchaa kaa vishay hota hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav is interested in building one of his department paths, but never seen as much social media activity in the work of other departments
 lalu yadav khud adhikansh vibhaag ke kaamkaaj main khulkar dakhlandaji bhi karte hai
 Which today does not match the politics and style of functioning of Akhilesh brand
 haalanki lalu se zyada unke beton ko ab raajnneeti ke brands lalu or akhilesh main se ek ko chunanaa hoga
 They can go to some extent in power by following Brand Lalu, but by adopting Brand Akhilesh, they can fulfill political ambitions of their life especially Tejashwi Yadav
 
 Otherwise, the brand Nitish will continue in Bihar as long as they want to remain in power
 lekin lalu kii pareshaani he ki filhal unhen agle kuch dinon main ye nirnay lenaa hoga kii do dhadon main banty samaajawaadee party ke kis dhade ke saath wo rahete hai
 Whether it is Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party or Shivpal's

 Strictly speaking on this issue, he said that all the states including the Kikerlas have been asked to collect details regarding Rohingyas as they have gone to different corners of the country
 bijepi kii kerala rajya parishad kii ek baithak main unhone kaha, 'main sabhi raajnneetik partiyon se rashtriya suraksha ke is mudde ko raajnneetik mudda nahin banane kii apil karata hum
 The presence of Rohingyas is not limited to the northeastern states

 "he said," The Center has asked the states to be vigilant
 rajyon ko unki gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke nirdesh die hai
 They should not get the documents to prove that they are Indian citizens
 ' grih mantri ne kaha ki rajyon se puure byore praapt kar lene ke baad kootnithik madhyamon se myanmar sarkaar ke samaksh yah mudda uthaaya jayega
 Recently, addressing a seminar organized by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that he does not understand why some people are objecting to the Rohingyas being repatriated while Myanmar is ready to take them back
 unhone kaha, 'grih mantralay ne apane halafname (supreme court main daayar) main apana paksh saaf kar diya he ki ye avaidh avrajak hai or unhen unke desh waapas bheja jayega
 Rohingyas are not refugees
 unhone aage kaha, 'sharnaarthi kaa darja paane ke liye ek prakriya he or unamem se kisi ne uskaa paalan nahin kiya

 ' neshnal herald akhbaar ke prakaashak associated jarnals limited (ageel) ne itio sthit herald house kii lij khatm karne or use khaali karne ke centre sarkaar ke aadesh ko dilli hai court main chunauti di he
 The court will hear this petition on Tuesday
 shahari vikaas mantralay ne apane aadesh main herald house kii lij khatm karte hue use 15 november tak khaali karne ko kaha he
 Earlier, a notice was issued to AJL to vacate the building
 lekin vibhaag ko is maamle main neshnal herald kii taraf se koi jawaab nahin mila jiske baad oktober main vibhaag ne aakhri karrwai karte hue ise khaali karne ke aadesh de die
 The Land and Development Office (LNDO) of the Ministry of Urban Development says that this land was given to AJL to publish the newspaper
 lekin akhbaar ke prakaashan se judi koi bhi gatividhi is imaarat main nahin ho rahi he
 The LNDO said that due to non-compliance of terms and conditions in this case and misuse of land, a decision has been taken to cancel and withdraw the lease
 jabaki ageel ne dilli hoicourt main apni yachika main kaha he ki philhal is imaarat se hindi, angreji or urdu ke saptahik akhbaar nikaale ja rahe hai
 Newspapers are being published as National Herald in English, Navjeevan in Hindi and Qaumi Awaaz in Urdu
 aise main imaarat ko khaali karaane kaa faisla puri tarah se manamaana or raajnneeti se prerit he
 The intention of the government is to suppress the voice of the opposition behind the evacuation of the old ITO building
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki hindi, angreji or urdu ke akhbaar nikaale jane ke baavjood agar jameen waapas lee ja rahi he or lij radd kii ja rahi he to saaf he ki yah in akhabaaron ko band karne kii manshaa se kiya ja rahaa he
 Which is a direct violation of Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution

 Jantar Mantar yahi vah jagah thi jahankishan bapat baburao urf anna hajarene jan lokapal ke liye pehla anshan kiya tha
 On April 6, 2011
 dilli main anna kii ye pehali dastak thi – itani joardaar ki satta ke galiyare tak hilte najar aae
 On seeing this, the whole country was with Anna
 jagah-jagah log – ‘main hum anna’ kii topi pahanakar sadakon par utar aae
 Then there used to be a strong group with Team Anna
 ab na wo daur he – na hi ab wo shor he
 Interestingly, even then, Anna's passion remains intact
 apane gaanv ralegan siddhi se anna ne phir se andolan kaa elaan kiya he
 In an interview, Anna says, "people now understand that they have been cheated
 ve unhen sabak sikhayenge jaise congress ko sikhaaya tha
 "will Anna be able to do it? The biggest question is whether Anna will be able to do anything like the Ramlila movement again
 tab kii team anna main logon ke mood or habit ko padhane kii kshamta thi
 Team Anna made the habit of people a part of his strategy
 saport ke liye unhone logon se esemes bhejne kii bajaay ek khaas number par ‘miss kaal‘ dene ko kaha
 People participated enthusiastically in this
 vah andolan ek aise daur main chalaa jab log bhrashtachar se ub chuke the [maamuli fark bhale aayaa ho, halaat ab bhi jas ke tas hi hai]
 Through the movement, Anna raised a hope among the people
 kamyaabi aamtaur par desh, kaal or paristhiti par nirbhar karti hai
 The JP movement in politics and the success of Amitabh's films that came in almost the same period are also considered to be the same factor
 anna ke tatkaaleen sahyogiyon ne andolan ko lagaataar sahi raste par rakhaa or bhatkaav kii gunjaaish khatm kar di thi
 Maybe yes
 
 
 anna kar sakate hanunaki chhavi bilkul bedaag he
 People believe Anna's words more than the rest
 vah mahatma gandhi ke bataae ahimsa ke raste par chalane main vishwaas karte hai
 He repeatedly appealed to the stage during Ramlila movement that people should remain calm or else the police would not let them stand
 logon ne anna kii baat maani
 Both Anna and the people stood in the ground
 bitate vakt ke saath unki team bikharati gai, lekin anna apni baat par kaayam rahe
 Even after the Ramlila movement, he always remained focused on the issue of corruption
 ye baaten anna ko taqatvar banaati hai
 Probably not
 
 
 anna ke vash kii baat nahidhanna kii puri team bikhar chuki he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who has been called the architect of the Anna movement, is now the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and is a contender for the post of Chief Minister in Delhi
 us andolan main anna ke ek taraf kejariwal najar aate the to duusari taraf kiran bedi
 Bedi is now bjp's chief ministerial candidate in Delhi
 anna andolan ko saport karne vaale yoga guru ramdev bhi lok sabha chunaavon main bijepi ke saath ho liye jabaki purv army chif general wike singh ab centre sarkaar main mantri hai
 After Kejriwal formed the party, Anna tried to create an agitation with Kiran Bedi and General VK Singh, but the result was the cipher
 baad ke dinon main bhi aise ek-do prayaas hue lekin sab ke sab naakaam sabit hue
 What can Anna do as well - Age is also dominating with passing time
 bande main he dam basharte
 
 
 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos at that time due to the 13-day fast
 pehle gudgaanv ke aspataal main unka ilaaj chalaa or phir unhone ek prakritik chikitsa centre par upachaar karaayaa
 He lives a disciplined life
 alp bhojan lete hai or niyamit taur par work-out karte hai
 Then Team Anna's Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Manish Sisodia and Kumar Vishwas took different paths, yet there are some people who remained associated with Anna movement but got separated due to differences
 justise santosh hegade, swami agnivesh or rajendra singh aise naam hai jo andolan main kuch vakt saath rahe lekin baad main apane saamaajik kaamon main vyast ho gaye
 Anna can make the movement again - yes he needs a team manager like Kejriwal was with him last time
 anna ko ek aise sahyogi kii jarurat he to nidar ho
 There is a possibility of doing something for the country
 bedaag ho
 You believe in walking on the path of non-violence
 ekala chalo re
 
 
 The Aam Aadmi Party has expressed support for Anna's movement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government
 aap netaa manish sisodiya ne kaha he ki wo ek kaaryakarta kii tarah anna ke andolan main unka saath denge
 During the Ramlila movement, there was talk of keeping the leaders away from the stage
 anna ke puraane saathi ab netaa ho gaye hai
 So now Anna does not even approve of his support
 anna jor dekar kehete hai, "ekala chalo re, mujhe kiran bedi or arvind kejariwal kii koi jarurat nahin he
 i know the public mere saath team nahin hone par mujhe dukhi kyon hona chahie?"sapana dekha
 
 
 And did not let him die, while finishing his fast, Anna said, "this is half the victory
" hamen abhi puri ladaai bhi jeetni he
 Anna might name his new movement the third movement of independence
 sabase khatarnaak hota he sapanom kaa mar janaa
 The dream that Anna had seen inspired by this line of loop - has not let him die yet
 aise main anna ke samarthakon ko shaayad noummid hone kii jarurat nahin

 These ordinary BJP workers and supporters need no more advocacy of a big leader nor to stand in line to meet the UP in-charge of the party
 fasebuk or twitor ne amit shah tak apni baat pahunchane kaa kaam kaaphi aasaan kar diya he
 BJP spokesperson from Uttar Pradesh Vijay Bahadur said, 'all the leaders are present

 BJP worker Amarendra Kumar says, 'through this website we can connect with it

 There are many people in the party, if anyone has problems then we share with our seniors and she goes to Amit Shah
 'vijay bahadur pathak kehete hai, 'kai log aise hai jo bijepi ke sarmathak hai, lekin varkar nahin hai
 They want Narendra Modi to become the Prime Minister of the country and form the BJP government
 wo suzav likhte hai or ham in sujhaavon kaa aadar karte hai

 He is getting a real impression of the UP BJP from the comments coming on his page and perhaps in all his meetings, Amit Shah is appealing to the leaders to forget the differences and gather for the success of the party

 He has said that when there is no war with anyone, then how are the soldiers martyred at the border
 ye sawaal uthaate hue aresas pramukh ne iskaa kaaran bhi bataaya or kaha ki aisa isliye ho rahaa he kyonki ham apana kaam thik se nahin kar rahe hai
 Mohan Bhagwat made this statement on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee program of Prahar Samaj Jagriti Sanstha in Nagpur on Thursday
 javaanon kii shahadat par baat rakhte hue mohan bhagwat ne aazaadee ke vakt kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that when the country did not get independence from the British, it was a period of sacrificing life for the freedom of the country
 yaa phir aazaadee ke baad agar koi yuddh hua yaa hota he to vahaan bhi seemaa par dushmano se ladate hue sainik apni jaan kii baaji lagaate hai or desh kii suraksha ke liye apana sabakuch qurbaan kar dete hai
 Further, Mohan Bhagwat questioned the martyrdom of the soldiers, commenting on the current situation
 yuddh ke alaava shahadat kaa koi kaaran nahinarees pramukh ne apane bayaan main kaha ki yuddh ke dauraan sainikon kii shahadat hoti he, lekin agar jab is vakt hamaare desh main koi yuddh nahin ho rahaa he or phir bhi sena ke jawan shahid ho rahe hai to iskaa matlab ye he ki ham apana kaam sahi dhang se nahin kar rahe hai
 He further said, "if there is no war, then there is no reason for a soldier to lose his life on the border
 lekin aisa ho rahaa he
 Bhagwat said - Stop the martyrdom of the soldiers
 Bhagwat not only expressed concern over the martyrdom of the soldiers on the border, but he also called for steps to be taken to stop this and make the country great
 mohan bhagwat kaa yah bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 Especially in the context of Jammu and Kashmir, where the Modi government has been taking up the elimination of terror prominently and patting its back, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat gave rise to the debate about why soldiers are being martyred on the border
 The claims have given a chance to hurt the opposition

 After the first T20 International against Australia, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has once again been criticized for his slow strike rate, but Glenn Maxwell feels that this is what the former Indian captain could have done on that slow pitch
 bharat ke 7 wicket par 126 ranon ke score main dhoni ne 37 gendon main 29 ran banaae
 On this pitch the ball was not coming directly to the bat
 lagaataar wicket gir chuke the or vah krij par yujavendra chahal ke saath the
 Maxwell defended Dhoni saying, "it (slow run pace) was probably right, the way the wicket was behaving, it was very difficult for any batsman to score runs and that too with such player Chahal One who does not specialize in hits
 ’ye bhi padhein- jasprit bumraah ne kiya umesh yadav kaa bachaavyah aisi pich thi, jisamen gend nichi rah rahi thi or dhoni keval ek hi chakka laga sake
 Maxwell said, "dhoni is definitely a world class finisher and he was finding it difficult to hit the ball from the middle of the bat
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki yah sahi tha ki vah strike rotate karte rahe
 He hit a six in the last over and i think it shows how difficult it was getting there
 ’maxwell ko pataa nahin ki world cap team main honge yaa nahinglen maxwell ko ab bhi ummid nahin he ki vah vishwa cap main jane vaali australian team main jagah bana paaenge
 However, he believes that his innings played in the first T20 against India can help in this
 bharat ke khilaaf pehle tii-20 main jeet dilaane main maxwell kii ardhashtakeey pari kaaphi ahm rahi
 He scored 56 runs in 43 balls, helping Australia win by three wickets on the last ball
 lekin, vishwa cap ke liye jane vaali 15 sadasyeey team main unke sthaan kii ganrti nahin he
 Maxwell said in the post-match press conference, 'I don't know if i will be in the World Cup squad and what number i will bat so i think it depends on the occasion
 agar main aaj kii tarah maukon kaa phayda uthaanaa jari rakh saktaa hum to behatar hoga

 film kaa naam:drishyamdiarector:nishikant kamtastar cast:ajay devgan, tabboo, shriya saran, rajat kapur, ishita dattivadhi:163 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3
 a Malayalam film is made at 5 starsouth India and then a Telugu, Kannada and Tamil remake of that film is also made
 in chaaron bhashaaon main bani is film ko jamkar saraahaa jaataa he or phir isi film kaa rimek hindi main bhi banataa he
 Yes, we are talking about the superhit Malayalam film 'drishyam' produced by Jeetu Joseph along with superstars Mohan Lal and Meena
 ab isi film kaa hindi rimek nishikant kaamat ne diarect kiya he
 The biggest feature of the film is its unique story which makes you think every moment what will happen now
 Let's know how the film 'drishyam': The story of Kahaani film is of a fourth failed middle class Marathi youth Vijay Salgowankar (ajay Devgan) who is a cable operator
 apni patni nandini (shriya saran) or do betiyon ke saath goa main rahata he
 His life is going well, then suddenly 'sam' son of IG Meera Deshmukh (tabu) of the city goes missing and Ajay and his whole family comes under suspicion
 ab kya ye chauthi fail cabel oparator apane parivaar ko kanoon se bachaa paaegaa? isi suspence par aage badhati he filmi kii kahani
 Scripts, acting, music films have been made in many languages (malayalam, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil) in the past and have been appreciated all the time
 nishikant kaamat ne apane andaaj main hindi rimek ke liye thodaa parivartan kiya he jo tarksangat he
 The thriller film wins only when you are forced to think 'what is going to happen next moment?' So the script as well as the screenplay and direction are also a compliment
 ajay devgan ne is film main behtareen abhinay kiya he
 Ajay has left a different mark in every scene as husband and father
 vaise to ajay kii maujuudagi kaa matlab tabadatod ection he lekin is film main ajay ne dimag se ladane kaa kaam kiya he
 Ajay Devgankafi will appear in a different form in this film
 vahiin abhinetri tabboo ek ai ji afasar ke rup main dabang avatar main dikhaai detii hai
 Earlier, in the movie 'koharam', she played a small role of a woman policeman, but this time she is also playing the role of a mother hurt by the disappearance of her son
 tabboo kaa ye rup aapako jarur anterten karegaa
 Apart from this, the work of actor Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta and Tabu's husband Rajat Kapoor as husband is also commendable
 ishita datta actress tanushri datta kii bahan hai or unki yah pehali film he or is puure ghatnakram main ishita kaa bhi ahm role he
 The film depicts the mother-daughter, father and family relationship well
 parivaar ke liye ek pita kis had tak ja saktaa he uskaa mujahiraa bhi nishikant ne dilachasp tareeke se pesh kiya he
 Being a thriller, music is not much important in this film, but Vishal Bhardwaj has made the atmosphere even more interesting with his songs, so that the common man can connect himself to the events
 kyon dekhen:'drishyam'behtareen script, shandaar acting or adbhut thriller film he
 Must be seen with the whole family as it is the story of a middle class family
 kyon naa dekhen:agar aapako suspence-thriller filmein nahin pasand he to hi aap ise naa dekhen

 upi main chunaav sir par he lekin sattadhari samaajawaadee party ke yadav-pita putr main ab tak sulah nahin ho saki he
 Earlier, both groups have gone to the Election Commission and presented their claim on the cycle of Samajwadi Party and its election symbol
 lekin is bich party ke puraane vafaadaar netaaon ne ek baar phir ajam khan se guzarish kii he ki wo donon ke bich sulah-safai karvaa den
 Even before this, Azam Khan had reconciled between Mulayam and Akhilesh, although she could not walk even for a day
 samaajawaadee party ke siyaasi dangal ke beechpita-putr main sulah karaneke liye ajam khan ek baar phir taiyaar ho gaye hai
 But their condition is that this will be the last attempt
 ajam ne kaha he ki vah is sabase zyada maayoos hai lekin noummid nahin
 In such a situation, Azam came to Delhi to meet Mulayam Singh Yadav with a formula
 ajam khan ne pehle phone par mulaayam or akhilesh kii baat karaane kii koshish kii, tab jaakar donon milakar aamane-saamne baithkar milane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 Mulayam Singh arrived in Lucknow from Delhi and Akhilesh went to his father's house in Lucknow and talked to him alone
 sulah kaa 'ajam' formula1
 Mulayam Singh Yadav to remain the national president, Akhilesh withdraw his claim
 2
 Akhilesh should be given the command of the state president and he played an important role in ticket distribution
 3
 Make Shivpal Yadav the national general secretary in Delhi and be sent to national politics

 darasal kai maukon par laga ki pita-putr kii jodi bhale hi maanane ko taiyaar ho jaati ho, lekin jaankaron ke mutabik jin shaktiyon se pita or putr alag-alag ghire hai, kahin naa kahin wo sulah main roda ban kar saamne aa jaati he
 Mulayam's weakness is Amar and Shivpal, while Akhilesh's hand is with Ram Gopal
 lakhanu main pita-putr kii mulaakaat ke baad dilli main ramgopal yadav ke ghankhilesh gut kii baithkahui or ramgopal yadav ne sulah kii sari sambhaavnaaon ko khaarij bhi kar diya
 However, party MP Javed Ali says that there is no quarrel in the party and Netaji is his ideal
 aise main sulah kaise hogi ye to shaayad khud yadav parivaar ko bhi nahin jaanata hoga
 Because, till now they meet in the morning, they fight in the evening, the next day they meet again in the morning and the fight unfolds by night
 parivaar kaa jhagada badastoor jari he
 Azam is busy in his last attempt
 formula bhi lekar aae hai, par faisla to akhilesh or mulaayam ko hi karnaa he varna pita-putr kii ye tut hindustan kii raajnneeti ke itihaas main darj hokar hameshaa yaad rakhi jaayegi

 During a wrestling competition in Aurangabad, a 17-year-old girl beat up a 34-year-old female wrestler
 aurangabad ke phulambari tehsil main harsul kii rahane vaali 17 varshiya amarine saiyada ne jab khud se doguni umr or kareeb doguni vajan vaali mahila pahalwaan kii chunauti sweekaar kii to vahaan maujuud sabhi dang rah gaye
 In fact, Shivani, a 34-year-old giant wrestler from Delhi, challenged female wrestlers as well as male wrestlers from Harsool
 shivani kii is chunauti ko koi mahila pahalwaan to kya purush pahalawaanon tak ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Then Amrin Syeda came forward and accepted Shivani's challenge
 sabhi chakit the ki yah ladki kya karne ja rahi he
 But as we saw in the movie Dangal, nothing is impossible if the strength is high
 jab kushti shuru hui to sabake man main yahi baat thi ki dilli kii pahilwaan ke saamne yah choti si ladki tik paaegi bhi yaa nahin
 Initially, Shivani was looking heavily on the small Amarin
 dekhne vaale bhi amarine saiyada kii naadaani par hansane lage
 Amrin's mind was also getting shaken, his confidence began to waver whether he accepted the challenge and made a mistake
 lekin kahin na kahin amarine ko apni training par bharosa tha or usne aatmavishvaas batora
 And the people watching the wrestling saw that shocking moment
 achaanak 49 kilo kii choti si amarine ne bangadi daav maaraa or palak jhapakate dilli kii 72 kilo kii damdaar mahila pahalwaan shivani mat par chaaron khaane chit
 Syeda, a resident of Ganori, a small village in Phulambari tehsil of Aurangabad district, practices wrestling in Begumpura in Amrin and participates in all wrestling competitions around Aurangabad
 aurangabad kii kushti pratiyogitaaon main ab tak saiyada kai nami pahalawaanon ko chit kar chuki hai
 Now it remains to be seen whether the talented Syeda gets further boost in wrestling and she is able to represent India at the national and international level, or this feat will remain as a small story

 Ramdev made public his opinion on FDI but he appeared to avoid getting involved in any political controversy over the issue
 unhone saaf kaha ki is mudde par main koi raajnneetik panga mol nahin lenaa chahta
 Because today auspicious work (patanjali's product is available online) is happening
 saaf he ki aamtaur par vibhinn vishyon par khulkar apane vichaar rakhane vaale ramdev is mudde par chuppi saadh gaye
 It was asked that the products are available online at a great discount, so who will buy goods from their store? On this question, Ramdev said that online market people are sitting with a lot of investment, who have put the habit of freebies to people
 ye kam honi chahie, ye aadat acchhee nahin hoti he
 We will support them in this and Patanjali's product will not be found here at a lower price than MRP

 On the quality of Patanjali's products, Ramdev said that we have 300 senior scientists, a quality control team of 500 people
 har product kii kai staron par jaanch hoti he lekin hamase phir bhi koi galati hui to ham product waapas lenge lekin desh ke logon ke swasthya se samjhauta nahin karenge
 Cardamdev, the loyalty of indigenous prosperity, announced in response to a question on the occasion that he is going to bring a system this month

 arunachal pradesh ke maamle main congress ne yahi aarope lagaaya tha magar wo supreme court main mukadmaa haar gai
 There is now a BJP government
 kanoon par vitt mantri kii pakad kii saakh na hoti to aise masalon par vaaki kanoon mantri blog likh rahe hote jinka naam sadanand gauda he
 The Finance Minister has written about the Appropriation Bill, does the question arise
 jaise vitt mantri kehete hai ki viniyog mat vibhaajan main gir gaya tha
 So was the vote divided in the house? The allegation is that the speaker did not allow the division of votes
 aarope he ki spikar ne dhwani mat se viniyog vidheyak paas hone kaa elaan kar diya
 Along with the failure of the Appropriation Bill, the rules of division of votes and the right of the speaker have to be understood
 kya spikar baadhya he ki vah mat vibhaajan kii maang ko sweekaar hi karegaa or baadhya he to spikar manaa kar detaa he to uske kilaaf karrwai ke kya praavdhaan hai
 Whether the bill passed by the speaker with voice vote can be challenged
 rajyapal ne khaarij kar diya to yahaan kya rajyapal ko yah adhikaar he ki vah spikar ke faisle ko palat de
 i do not have all the answers, but the Finance Minister's blog is getting curious about many questions
 vitt mantri ne viniyog vidheyak ke bare main apane blog main likhaa he ki 'dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki aaj kii taarikh tak na to mukhyamantri na hi vidhansabha adhyaksh ne viniyog vidhi kii pramanit prati rajyapal ke paas nahin bheji he
 It is therefore natural that the Appropriation Bill has not been approved by the Governor
 ' Now the question arises whether the speaker or the Chief Minister had sent it to the Governor on March 18 after allegedly passing the Appropriation Bill by voice vote
 kya spikar yaa mukhyamantri ye tathy pesh kar sakate hai ki bheja tha
 The Finance Minister writes that he had not sent it and has not sent it till date
 lekin jis viniyog vidheyak ko lekar sarkaar gir gai or raashtrapati shashan lag gaya uske bare main rajyapal ne jaankaree kyon nahin maangi yaa maangi to nahin di gai
 Whether the entire decision was taken without looking at a certified copy of the appropriation bill or was it decided that a certified copy of the bill was not sent
 dainik uttarakhand, hindustan or amar ujaalaa ne is sawaal ko lekar khabar chhaapi thi
 According to different reports, the appropriation bill passed on March 18 was immediately sent by the speaker to the governor
 vitt mantri kehete hai ki aaj tak vidheyak kii pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 According to the sources of our colleague Dinesh Mansera, a certified copy has been sent to the Raj Bhavan on March 28
 chunki ye jaankaree sutara aadhaarit he isliye ham is par daawa nahin kar sakate lekin agar ye sahi jaankaree he to viniyog vidheyak ko pramanik prati abhi kaise bheji gai
 Someone asked for it or the speaker thought of it
 aaj uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha ki rajyapal ko bheje gayi viniyog vidheyak main koi chhedchhad naa kii jaae or use usee rup main ab centre se paas karaayaa jaae kyonki ye ek bahumat vaali sarkaar kii ore se paas kiya gaya viniyog vidheyak he
 The Finance Minister further writes in his blog about the Appropriation Bill that the alleged discussion on the Appropriation Bill and all the facts related to its passage clearly point towards its passage
 ishaara karte hai yaa pakke taur par kehete hai ki viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua
 Then why does the Finance Minister write in the next paragraph that 'there is a serious apprehension about the Appropriation Bill
 viniyog vidheyak paarit na hone par sarkaar ko 18 march ko hi istipha de dena chahie tha lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 ' matvibhaajan hua yaa nahin, nahin hua to matvibhaajan main kaise yah vidheyak gir gaya
 Authentic copy of the Bill was sent to the Governor or not
 spikar ne vidheyak ko pramanit kiya yaa nahin kiya
 Either the appropriation bill is passed or not passed, but a third situation emerges here that there is a serious apprehension that it has passed
 jetali ne likhaa he ki har baat ke pramaan ke taur par dastauez maujuud hai
 It further writes that 'if the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly believes that the rebel mlas voted in favor of the Appropriation Bill, it has been passed, then the rebel mlas cannot be disqualified
 ' The Speaker and the Congress said that the Raj Bhavan along with the 9-member opposition party had gone to demand division, hence disqualified only after hearing the arguments of their lawyers
 patrakaron ne poocha ki raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad kyon ayogy qaraar diya gaya to spikar ne kaha ki unhen raashtrapati shashan lagane kii likhit soochna nahin he
 That is, the question of cancellation of membership is a question, here is the question that when the 35 members are saying that they are not with the government and the government does not have majority, then how did the speaker declare to pass by voice vote
 spikar ne yah bhi kaha ki agar sadasyon ko lagata he ki sarkaar alpamat main he to unhone sadan main bahumat sabit karne kii maang kyon nahin kii
 Keep in mind that when the Finance Bill falls in the House, it is also considered a no-confidence motion
 hamane em en kaul or es el shakdhar kii kitaab practice and prosijar of parliament kitaab main jaakar dekha ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar spikar ke kya adhikaar hai to ye jaankaree mili
 The Speaker's powers are given on page number 974 in the event of division of votes
 pej 974 mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin dene ke bare main spikar ke visheshadhikaar bataata he
 It states that a member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker's decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh ko sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage to maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 Page 118 states that the Speaker's authority is supreme within the House and he gets these rights on the basis of his complete impartiality
 pej 123 kaa second para kahata he ki mantralayon ke sawaal par spikar ko kai adhikaar hasil hai
 Although rules have been made to accept the questions, the speaker has the right to interpret them
 tippaniyan One question is about the role of Raj Bhavan
 rajyapal ne pehle das din kaa samay diya ki sarkaar sadan main bahumat sabit kare
 Then the governor sent a report that there is a constitutional crisis
 to kya rajyapal ne spikar ko soochna di ki ab ve bahumat sabit karne kaa prastaav waapas lete hai yaa rajyapal jise chahen jo bhi report bhej sakate hai
 Why did the governor give the government a chance to prove its majority when the bill was dropped, that too ten days
 sting oparation kii daleel di ja rahi he ki ek mukhyamantri len dein kii baat karte dikh rahaa he
 In this sense, President's rule should have been implemented in Bengal where many of the leaders and ministers are seen in the sting operation taking money
 15 oktober 2014 ko maharashtra main chunaav the
 a month before that, on 28 September, the Congress ncp's alliance was broken when President's rule was imposed there
 vipaksh ko ashanka ho rahi he ki sahyogi sanghavaad kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi ab sangh kii sarkaron ko giraane main sahyog karne lagi he
 BJP is asking what to do if there is a constitutional crisis
 arunachal pradesh ke maamle main congress ne yahi aarope lagaaya tha magar wo supreme court main mukadmaa haar gai
 There is now a BJP government
 viniyog vidheyak ke paas yaa fail hone ke saath-saath mat vibhaajan ke niyam or spikar ke adhikaar ko bhi samajhnaa hoga
 Is the speaker bound that he will accept the demand for division of the vote and if the speaker refuses, then what are the provisions for action against him? spikar ne dhwani mat se jo vidheyak paas kiya he kya use chunauti di ja sakati he
 If the Governor rejects, does the Governor here have the right to reverse the Speaker's decision
 mere paas saare ke jawaab nahin hai magar vitt mantri ke blog se kai sawaalon ko lekar jigyaasa ho rahi he
 The Finance Minister has written about the Appropriation Bill in his blog, 'it is to be noted that till date, neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly has sent a certified copy of the Appropriation Law to the Governor
 isliye swaabhaavik he ki viniyog vidheyak ko rajyapal kii manzuri nahin mili he
 ' ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya 18 march ko kathith rup se dhwani mat se viniyog vidheyak paas karaane ke baad spikar yaa mukhyamantri ne use rajyapal ke paas bheja tha
 Can the speaker or the chief minister present the fact that it was sent
 vitt mantri to likhte hai ki nahin bheja tha or aaj tak nahin bheja he
 But why the Governor did not ask for or ask for information about the Appropriation Bill, which the Government fell and President's rule was imposed
 kya sara faisla viniyog vidheyak kii pramanik prati dekhe bina hi le liya gaya yaa faisla yun hua ki vidheyak kii pramanit prati bheji hi nahin gai
 The daily Uttarakhand, Hindustan and Amar Ujala had published news regarding this question
 alag-alag khabaron ke mutabik 18 march ko paas kiya gaya viniyog vidheyak spikar ne turant rajyapal ko bhej diya tha
 The Finance Minister says that till date a certified copy of the Bill has not been sent
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ke sutron ke anusaar aaj yani 28 march ko rajbhavan ko isaki pramanit prati bheji gai he
 Since this information is formula based, we cannot claim it, but if it is correct information then how the authentic copy of the Appropriation Bill was sent yet
 kisi ne maanga yaa spikar ko iskaa khyaal aayaa
 Today, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said that the appropriation bill sent to the governor should not be tampered with and should be passed by the Center in the same form as it is an appropriation bill passed by a majority government
 vitt mantri apane blog main viniyog vidheyak ke bare main aage likhte hai ki viniyog vidheyak par kathith charchaa or uske paarit hone sambandhi sabhi tathy saaf taur par iske paarit na hone kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Indicates or asserts that the appropriation bill has not passed
 phir vitt mantri agle paragraph main kyon likhte hai ki 'viniyog vidheyak ke bare main gambhir ashanka he
 If the Appropriation Bill was not passed, the government should have resigned on 18 March but it did not do so
 ' Whether or not the vote was split or not, how did this bill fall in the division? vidheyak kii pramanik prati rajyapal ko bheji gai yaa nahin bheji gai
 The speaker did or did not ratify the bill
 yaa to viniyog vidheyak paas hua yaa nahin hua lekin yahaan ek teesri sthiti ubhar rahi he ki gambhir ashanka he ki paas hua
 Jaitley has written that there are documents as proof of everything
 aage likhte hai ki 'agar vidhansabha adhyaksh kii baat sahi maane ki baagi vidhayakon ne viniyog vidheyak ke paksh main matdaan kiya isliye yah paarit ho gaya he, tab baagi vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa
 ' spikar or congress ne kaha ki 9 sadsy virdohi dal ke saath rajbhavan matvibhaajan kii maang karne gaye the isliye unke vakeelon kii daleel sunne ke baad hi ayogy tehraaya gaya
 When the reporters asked why they were disqualified after the imposition of President's rule, the speaker said that they did not have written notice of imposition of President's rule
 yani sadsyta radd karne kaa sawaal ek sawaal he, yahaan sawaal he ki jab 35 sadsy kah rahe hai ki ve sarkaar ke saath nahin hai or sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he to spikar ne dhwani mat se paas hone kaa elaan kaise kar diya
 The speaker also said that if the members feel that the government is in minority then why did they not demand to prove majority in the House
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki jab vitt vidheyak sadan main gir jaataa he to wo bhi ek kism kaa avishvaas prastaav hi mana jaataa he
 We saw in the book Practice and Procedure of Parliament by MN Kaul and SL Shakadhar that we got the information about the rights of the speaker regarding the division of votes
 pej number 974 par mat vibhaajan kii sthiti main spikar ke adhikaar die gaye hai
 Page 974 lays down the Speaker's prerogative of not allowing the division of votes
 isamen kaha gaya he ki wois vot par spikar ke faisale ko bina chunauti die koi sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam record karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The speaker can accept the request if he feels the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 pej 118 main kaha gaya he ki sadan ke andar spikar kaa adhikaar sarvocch he or ye adhikaar uski purna nishpakshta ke aadhaar par use hasil hota he
 The second paragraph of page 123 states that the speaker has many rights over the question of ministries
 haalanki sawaalon ko sweekaar karne ko lekar niyam banaae gaye hai lekin uski vyakhya kaa adhikaar spikar ke paas hota he
 The comments ek sawaal rajbhavan kii bhoomika ko lekar he
 The governor gave the first ten days for the government to prove its majority in the house
 phir rajyapal ne report bheji ki sanvaidhanik sankat he
 So did the Governor inform the Speaker that now they withdraw the proposal to prove majority or the Governor can send the report to whomever he wishes
 jab vidheyak gir gaya tha tab rajyapal ne sarkaar ko bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka kyon diya wo bhi das din
 The sting operation is being argued that a chief minister is seen talking about the transaction
 is lihaaz se to raashtrapati shashan bengal main lagu ho janaa chahie tha jahaan ke kai netaa mantri or saasand paise lete hue sting oparation main dikhte hai
 There were elections in Maharashtra on 15 October 2014
 usase ek maheenaa pehle 28 sitambar ko congress ensipi kaa gathbandhan tut gaya tha tab vahaan raashtrapati shashan laga tha
 The opposition fears that the BJP, which has been giving the slogan of collaborative federalism, is now cooperating in toppling the Union governments
 bijepi kah rahi he ki sanvaidhanik sankat he to kya karen
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, this was alleged by the Congress, but it lost the case in the Supreme Court
 vahaan ab bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Now the question arises whether the speaker or the Chief Minister had sent it to the Governor on March 18 after allegedly passing the Appropriation Bill by voice vote
 kya spikar yaa mukhyamantri ye tathy pesh kar sakate hai ki bheja tha
 The Finance Minister writes that he had not sent it and has not sent it till date

 ' spikar or congress ne kaha ki 9 sadsy virdohi dal ke saath rajbhavan matvibhaajan kii maang karne gaye the isliye unke vakeelon kii daleel sunne ke baad hi ayogy tehraaya gaya
 When the reporters asked why they were disqualified after the imposition of President's rule, the speaker said that they did not have written notice of imposition of President's rule
 yani sadsyta radd karne kaa sawaal ek sawaal he, yahaan sawaal he ki jab 35 sadsy kah rahe hai ki ve sarkaar ke saath nahin hai or sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he to spikar ne dhwani mat se paas hone kaa elaan kaise kar diya
 The speaker also said that if the members feel that the government is in minority then why did they not demand to prove majority in the House
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki jab vitt vidheyak sadan main gir jaataa he to wo bhi ek kism kaa avishvaas prastaav hi mana jaataa he
 We saw in the book Practice and Procedure of Parliament by MN Kaul and SL Shakadhar that we got the information about the rights of the speaker regarding the division of votes
 pej number 974 par mat vibhaajan kii sthiti main spikar ke adhikaar die gaye hai
 Page 974 lays down the Speaker's prerogative of not allowing the division of votes
 isamen kaha gaya he ki wois vot par spikar ke faisale ko bina chunauti die koi sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam record karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The speaker can accept the request if he feels the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 pej 118 main kaha gaya he ki sadan ke andar spikar kaa adhikaar sarvocch he or ye adhikaar uski purna nishpakshta ke aadhaar par use hasil hota he
 The second paragraph of page 123 states that the speaker has many rights over the question of ministries
 haalanki sawaalon ko sweekaar karne ko lekar niyam banaae gaye hai lekin uski vyakhya kaa adhikaar spikar ke paas hota he
 The comments ek sawaal rajbhavan kii bhoomika ko lekar he
 The governor gave the first ten days for the government to prove its majority in the house
 phir rajyapal ne report bheji ki sanvaidhanik sankat he
 So did the Governor inform the Speaker that now they withdraw the proposal to prove majority or the Governor can send the report to whomever he wishes
 jab vidheyak gir gaya tha tab rajyapal ne sarkaar ko bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka kyon diya wo bhi das din
 The sting operation is being argued that a chief minister is seen talking about the transaction
 is lihaaz se to raashtrapati shashan bengal main lagu ho janaa chahie tha jahaan ke kai netaa mantri or saasand paise lete hue sting oparation main dikhte hai
 There were elections in Maharashtra on 15 October 2014
 usase ek maheenaa pehle 28 sitambar ko congress ensipi kaa gathbandhan tut gaya tha tab vahaan raashtrapati shashan laga tha
 The opposition fears that the BJP, which has been giving the slogan of collaborative federalism, is now cooperating in toppling the Union governments
 bijepi kah rahi he ki sanvaidhanik sankat he to kya karen
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, this was alleged by the Congress, but it lost the case in the Supreme Court
 vahaan ab bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The Speaker and the Congress said that the Raj Bhavan along with the 9-member opposition party had gone to demand division, hence disqualified only after hearing the arguments of their lawyers
 patrakaron ne poocha ki raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad kyon ayogy qaraar diya gaya to spikar ne kaha ki unhen raashtrapati shashan lagane kii likhit soochna nahin he
 That is, the question of cancellation of membership is a question, here is the question that when the 35 members are saying that they are not with the government and the government does not have majority, then how did the speaker declare to pass by voice vote
 spikar ne yah bhi kaha ki agar sadasyon ko lagata he ki sarkaar alpamat main he to unhone sadan main bahumat sabit karne kii maang kyon nahin kii
 Keep in mind that when the Finance Bill falls in the House, it is also considered a no-confidence motion
 hamane em en kaul or es el shakdhar kii kitaab practice and prosijar of parliament kitaab main jaakar dekha ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar spikar ke kya adhikaar hai to ye jaankaree mili
 The Speaker's powers are given on page number 974 in the event of division of votes
 pej 974 mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin dene ke bare main spikar ke visheshadhikaar bataata he
 It states that a member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker's decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh ko sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage to maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 Page 118 states that the Speaker's authority is supreme within the House and he gets these rights on the basis of his complete impartiality
 pej 123 kaa second para kahata he ki mantralayon ke sawaal par spikar ko kai adhikaar hasil hai
 Although rules have been made to accept the questions, the speaker has the right to interpret them
 tippaniyan One question is about the role of Raj Bhavan
 rajyapal ne pehle das din kaa samay diya ki sarkaar sadan main bahumat sabit kare
 Then the governor sent a report that there is a constitutional crisis
 to kya rajyapal ne spikar ko soochna di ki ab ve bahumat sabit karne kaa prastaav waapas lete hai yaa rajyapal jise chahen jo bhi report bhej sakate hai
 Why did the governor give the government a chance to prove its majority when the bill was dropped, that too ten days
 sting oparation kii daleel di ja rahi he ki ek mukhyamantri len dein kii baat karte dikh rahaa he
 In this sense, President's rule should have been implemented in Bengal where many of the leaders and ministers are seen in the sting operation taking money
 15 oktober 2014 ko maharashtra main chunaav the
 a month before that, on 28 September, the Congress ncp's alliance was broken when President's rule was imposed there

 yah pehla maamla he jab sibiai or kisi rajya kii police ke bich sidhaa takaraav hua ho
 Let us tell you that according to the law of the formation of CBI, there is a provision in any state to get permission before its action
 aapako bataa den ki sibiai kaa gathan dilli vishesh police pratishthan adhinium-1946 ke tahat hua he
 According to Section-5 of this Act, CBI has been given the right of investigation in all the areas of the country, but at the same time it has been clearly stated in Section-6 that CBI enters the jurisdiction of that state without the permission of the state government
 Can not kuch din pehle hi pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh or chhattisgarh kii sarkaron ne dhara-6 kaa istemaal karte hue bina unki ijaajat ke sibiai kii karrwai par roak laga di thi
 According to this prohibition, the central authorities, government undertakings and private individuals will not be able to investigate directly

 Significantly, the CBI on Sunday reached the Kolkata Police Commissioner's house for questioning in the chit fund scam

 On the cbi's plea in the Supreme Court, the court has said that the evidence against the commissioner should be produced destroying evidence and the case will now be heard on 5 February
 aam aadmi party sarkaar or dilli sachivalay main adhikariyon ke bich khinchataan jagajaahir he
 a big reason for this is the large number of officers appointed by LG
 philhal dilli sarkaar ke sutron se swasthya vibhaag se judi kai meeting kii jaankaree saamne ai he, jinamein aarope lagaaya gaya he ki oktober ke maheene main alji kii taraf se niyukt ek adhikari kareeb ek darjan samiksha baithkon main shaamil hi nahin hue
 The Health Department of Delhi Government held several important meetings in the month of October
 inamen swasthya mantri ke saath-saath vibhaag ke bade adhikari shaamil hote hai
 'aaj Tak' has papers related to Health Department meeting
 dilli sarkaar ke sutron se mili ye kagajaat se saamne aayaa he ki dilli ke logon kii sehat yaa unke ilaaj kii chintaa se judi baithkon main dilli ke swasthya sachiv chandrakar bharti shaamil nahin hue
 It is alleged that he did not even attend one of the 12 review meetings of the department on all kinds of health related things including dengue and chikungunya in October
 dilli sarkaar ke sutron ke mutabik swasthya vibhaag kii oktober maheene main hi 1 oktober se 19 oktober tak 12 baithken ho chuki hai ,lekin swasthya sachiv kisi bhi baithak main nahin aae
 The allegations are that the Health Department of Delhi is reviewing Delhi's health and deciding the way forward in its absence
 swasthya sachiv itane bephikr hai ki baithak main naa aane kii soochna bhi 12 main se maatr ek baar di, jab unhone bataaya ki kanoon sachiv ke saath baithak pehle se tay hone ke kaaran wo baithak main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 After this or earlier he did not even give the reason for not attending the departmental meetings
 dilli sarkaar kii kisi bhi baithak main shaamil hone se pehle har adhikari kii maujuudagi ko ek kaagaj main utaara jaataa he
 Before coming to the meeting, the issues of the meeting, which are being held, are also given to the officials ahead of time
 'aaj tak' ke paas oktober ke maheene main hui tamaam meeting kaa data maujuud he
 It is written about which officer attended or did not attend the review meeting
 haalanki dilli sarkaar main afasaron kaa daawa he ki kai vibhaagon main jimmedaari hone kii vajah se baithak main janaa mushkil hota he
 Therefore, in the meetings where the officials are unable to reach, they send their representatives
 afasaron kii maane to swasthya vibhaag kii baithak main bhi adhikariyon ne apane numaayinde bheje the
 lg-appointed officer Chandrakar Bharti has been accused earlier
 kejariwal sarkaar ye sawaal uthaa chuki he ki jab dilli mendengue-chikanguniafaila tha, us dauraan swasthya sachiv chuttee par gaye hue the
 Apart from this, Chandrakar Bharti was also accused of delaying the notification of Chinese Manjha
 dilli sarkaar keswasthya mantri satyendra jainane supreme court main daakhil halafname main bhi is baat kaa zikr tak kiya tha ki swasthya sachiv vibhaag kii baithkon main nahin aate or unako bina bataae chuttee par chale jate hai
 After the Manjha incident, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia wrote a letter to LG recommending disciplinary action against Chandrakar

 inputah bhashaa In Lucknow, a man madly unrequited in love burnt Mehbooba's mother who interrupted her 'ishq'
 jab rafique naam ke is jununee aashiq ko police ne giraftaar kiya to usne kaha ki vah 'dar' film kaa shahrukh khan he, or vah film kaa ant badalanaa chahta tha, jisamen shahrukh kii maut ho jaati he
 Rafiq said that he has watched the film 'der' 100 times
 usne bataaya ki film main shahrukh ko uski 'kiran' nahin mili thi, lekin vah apni 'kiran' ko har haal main hasil karnaa chahta tha, isliye usne mohabbat ke raste main aa rahi 'kiran' kii maa ko jalaakar maar daalaa
 The police have arrested Rafiq for the murder and sent him to jail and advised him to undergo brain treatment
 rafique kaa kahana he ki uske zahan main 'dar' film main hui shahrukh khan kii maut baar-baar gumti he, isliye use kahani kaa yah ant sakht naapsand tha
 If 'kiran' becomes someone else, it was out of his tolerance
 vah har baar film dekhne ke baad kasam khaataa tha ki vah zindaa rahegaa or 'kiran' ko hasil karegaa
 After this, a girl living in Atrauli village of Lucknow started thinking of her as 'kiran' and stopped her path like in the film
 lekin na to vah ladki rafique ko pasand karti thi, na ladki kii maa ko vah pasand tha
 The girl's mother had reprimanded Rafiq many times, and with this, Rafiq hatched the plot of her murder
 ek rose jab vah ghar main khaanaa bana rahi thi, rafique ne ghar kii chat par chadhakar us par petrol kaa puraa can ulat diya or phir maachis kii tili jalaakar phenki
 The mother died of burns
 police hiraasat main rafique ne enditivi se kaha, "mujhe lag rahaa tha ki uski maa bilkul 'dar' film ke sani deol kaa role kar rahi he, or kiran ko mujhase chhinana chaahati he, isliye maine use maar diya
