 The shocking thing is that when this accused was chasing it to catch the team of Special Cell, it jumped into Yamuna near ISBT to escape from the police
 iske baad red main shaamil special cell ke ek consteble manoj tyaagi ne yamuna main kudakar aaropee ko pakadaa
 Let me tell you that this accused Lopsang Lama, a resident of Nepal, tried to escape from the police by swimming in Yamuna for a long time, but Manoj Tyagi, the constable of the special cell, finally caught him
 isse pehle 25 july 2018 ko vasant vihaar ke muniraka main dilli mahila ayog (disidblu) kii pramukh swati maliwal ne red kar 16 nepali ladakiyon ko bachaaya tha
 Since that time, Lama, the mastermind of the purchase and sale of Nepali girls, was on the run
 police ne lopsang lamas par 1 lakh rupye kaa inaam bhi rakhaa tha
 The accused Lama's father is a retired Assam Rifle soldier
 lambey vakt se aaropee nepal kii ladakiyon ko job ke naam par khadi deshon main bech diya karata tha
 In return, every girl earned 40 to 50 thousand rupees by selling
 ab tak aaropee kareeb do darjan se zyada nepali ladakiyon ko khadi or duusare deshon main bhej chukaa he
 According to police sources, most of the girls sent out of Nepal in the name of jobs are also pushed into the business of prostitution

 bhrashtachar se ladane vaala lokapal kya kabhi ban paaegaa
 Even if an institution like Lokpal is ready, its strength will be so much
 ye sawaal isliye maujuun ho gaya he kyonki sarkaar ne is mudde par bada golmol jawaab diya he
 Regarding the all-party meeting, Kapil Sibal said that the government has promised to bring the Lokpal Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament, but it has no commitment regarding the time frame to pass it
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘ham sansad ke monsoon satr main lokapal vidheyak pesh kiye jane ke liye patibaddh hai
 We never said that it would pass in the monsoon session itself
 ’ unhone kaha ki sarvadaleey baithak main hissaa lene vaale do dalon ne suzav diya he ki is vidheyak ko sheetakaaleen satr main paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, Home Minister p Chidambaram expressed satisfaction about this and hoped that a consensus would be formed on the issue and the government would be able to present the draft Lokpal Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament
 unhone kaha, ‘kal kii sarvadaleey baithak ke nateezon se ham khush hai
 We are confident that we will be able to move the process of introducing the Bill in the Monsoon Session of Parliament and passing it as soon as possible
 ’grih mantri ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kii taraf se kal bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak main sansadeey prakriya kii shreshthata or vidheyakon ko banane tathaa paarit karaane main raajnneetik dalon kii bhoomika par jor diya gaya
 His remarks are giving a sense of relief to the government, which was so far grappling with the Gandhian Anna Hazare side on the issue of Lokpal Bill surrounded by attacks on the issue of corruption
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘ham sansad ke monsoon satr main vidheyak pesh karenge
 It will be discussed
 prayaas hoga ki jitani jaldi sambhav ho, vidheyak paarit ho jaae, lekin yah sansad ke sadasyon or sthapit prakriyaaon ko apnaane kii unki ichha par nirbhar karegaa
 'it is noteworthy that after the all-party meeting, Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj had said that the bill should be sent to the standing committee of Parliament after presenting it in the monsoon session
 sthaayee samiti sabhi raajnneetik dalon, rajya sarkaron or samaaj ke sadasyon se unke vichaar jaanane ke baad sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main apni report pesh kare or uski siforeeshon ko samahit karte hue vidheyak ko paarit kiya jaae
 Both Chidambaram and Sibal said that some parties, including the BJP, have not yet expressed their views on the provisions of the bill and bringing the Prime Minister and the judiciary under its ambit and the government has no objection to it
 grih mantri ne kaha ki adhiktar dalon ne kaha he ki ve sansad main vidheyak pesh kiye jane par apane vichaar rakhenge or ‘unki yah baat vaazib he
 He said that from the stand of political parties, it seems that most of them are not in favor of bringing the Prime Minister and the judiciary under the purview of Lokpal Bill
 donon mantri haalanki, ‘uchit’ lokapal vidheyak nahin laae jane kii sthiti main 16 agast se phir se anshan karne kii gandhivadi anna hazaare kii chetavanee ke bare main sidhe tippanee karne se bachate najar aae
 Chidambaram said, 'I don't think we need to assume that there will be a fast and that too will start from August 16
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki sarkaar kii ore se sansad main pesh kiye jane vaale lokapal vidheyak se adhikansh log santusht honge
 Sibal also expressed confidence that the people will accept the bill put on behalf of the government
 vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne kii prakriya main samaaj ke sadasyon ko shaamil kiye jane kii kuch raajnneetik dalon kii aalochana ke sambandh main chidambaram ne kaha, un paristhitiyon main yah mahasoos kiya gaya tha ki hazaare paksh ko saath lenaa behatar vikalp hoga
 Asked about dmk's advocacy of bringing the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal Bill, Sibal retorted that the NDA constituent Akali Dal had opposed it
 unhone kaha, ‘ye sab charchaa ke vishay hai
 ' dilli kii patiala house court ne 37 saal puraane plane hijank ke ek maamle main 2 logon ko bari kar diya he
 The case dates back to 1981, when a plane going from Delhi to Srinagar was hijacked by 5 armed Sikhs
 ve log vimaan ko pakistan ke lahore le gaye the
 Where Pak commandos had dharadbocha them
 idhar punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne is faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 He wrote in tweeting that, 'I welcome the Delhi court's decision to acquit Satnam Singh and Tejinder Pal, in which case he has already been sentenced in Pakistan
 'I welcome Delhi Court’s order acquitting Satnam Singh and Tejinder Pal Singh, accused in 37-year-old AI hijacking case
 They had already served life terms in Pakistan and could not be punished again for the same crime
 — Capt
 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) August 27, 2018 Actually, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was in jail at that time
 khalistaanke samarthak plane hijakars jaranel singh ko jail se chhudaane kii maang kar rahe the
 However, after the plane reached Lahore, the Pakistani commandos arrested all these hijackers and the case against them also went on in Pakistan
 vahaan kii adaalat ne is haijacking cese main sabhi aropiyon ko doshi qaraar dete hue 14 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 When all the convicts got out of jail after serving 14 years of imprisonment, 2 of them had reached Canada and the US
 lekin vahaan kii sarkaron ne un donon ko bharat bhej diya
 The Government of India had filed a sedition case against him, but in the absence of evidence, Satnam Singh and Tejinder Pal Singh were acquitted by the Patiala House Court on charges of treason
 court ne mana ki plane hijank karne ke maamle main sabhi doshi pehle hi pakistan main sajaa kaat chuke hai
 His lawyer argued that life imprisonment is the maximum punishment
 jise vah is aparaadh ke liye kaat chuke hai
 Therefore, it will be an injustice to him to give a second sentence in this case
 dilachasp yah bhi he ki jis vakt 1981 main plane kohaijaikakia gaya tha
 At that time the punishment for this crime in India was only 6 months, but because the case went on in Pakistan
 isliye un sabhi ko 14 saal kaid kii sajaa di gai
 The plane that was hijacked had 111 passengers while 6 crew members
 is maamle se jude baaki or teen plane hijakars gajendra singh, jasvir singh or karan singh kabhi bharat laute hi nahin
 Therefore, the trial in the court of India could not begin
 patiala house court se satnam singh or tejendra paal singh ke bari hone ke baad bada sawaal ye he ki agar bhavishya main gajendra, jasvir or karan waapas aae to kya unke khilaaf bhi deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jayega

 dilli main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal najeeb jang ke bich chhidi jang par ek baar phir bijepi ne hamalaa bolaa he
 The BJP has alleged that the language used by the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party is 'character of c grade Bollywood film'
 dilli ke siem kejarivalane ek din pehle hi uparajyapal par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhen 'bijepi kaa poling agent' qaraar diya tha
 State BJP president Satish Upadhyay said while planting, 'it seems that Arvind Kejriwal is influenced by the language of the character of c grade Bollywood films
 ' iske alaava, purv ipies adhikari auradilli chunaavamein bijepi kaa cheharaa raheen kiran bedi ne bhitwitor ke jariekejariwal par unki bhashaa ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa
 -input language ek aisi duniya kii talash messrun shitanshvani prakaashan, dariyaganj,nai dilli-2
 Price: Rs 200 aaj kaa har yuva kavi puure sahaj bhav se nai duniya kii talash main laga he
 a world in which there is only purity, only fruitlessness
 hindi ke yuva kaviyon kii yahi utsukata inhen is jatil samay se ladane kaa saahas pradaan karti rahi he
 The poems of Arun Shetansh during his recitation have been more or less similar
 arun ke pehle sangrah huek aisi duniya kii talash main' kii kavitaayen bhi aisi hi aag lapetakar hamaare samaksh khadi hoti hai, hajir hoti hai: ghar ke kone main / ek paanv par khadaa hum / tumhaari prarthana ke liye / dhyaan ke liye / chaiyn kii neend ke liye / taaki tum rah sako / tanaav mukt
 According to the legends of Hindi criticism, the social utility of poetry is abolished
 parantu hamaare aalochak yah bataane se kataraate rahe hai, gurej karte rahe hai ki sahitya kii koun-si vidha he jisaki saamaajik upyogita bachi hui he? kavita ko lekar aalochakon kaa yah sankoch samaj se pare he
 Arun also says in his poem 'chand ki Chori': Someone stole the truth / stole the lie / loved / maybe everyone stole / stole the lie / loved / maybe everyone stole the country / 
 shaayad hamaare aalochak bhi samakaleen hindi kavita ke saath aisa hi kuch kar rahe hai
 As far as Arun's poems are concerned, his poems continue to underline the importance of time, the importance of time beyond
 haa, yah bhi satya he ki arun ke kavi vyaktitv kii apni ek seemaa rekha he jisase ve aage nahin nikal pate
 In fact, Arun appears to be taking a very important genre like poetry very lightly
 yah arun se zyada kavita ke liye khatarnaak he
 However, in this collection, his poems like 'babuji', 'earth's suffering', 'chai', 'mama ka Machan', etc
 reveal the struggles and sufferings of the common man as being completely independent in various forms
 isse yah bhi ujagar hota he ki arun kaa anubhav, anveshan, sarjak hamaare samay kaa puraa lekha-jokha rakhe he
 Although senior poet Arun Kamal writes that "this first collection of poems by Arun Shetansh is a living light of natural talent, ideological commitment and future dreams", but in reality, Arun Shetansh, that is, his poet-personality is still very much from contemporary Hindi poetry There is something to be learned, much to be gained
 isliye ki kavita main thandapan kavi ko nu
 The farmer only delivers
 arun ko bhashaa or muhaavarey par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Despite this, Arun's poems enrich us
 ashok vaajapeyi ne kabhi vinod kumaar shukla kii kavita par vichaar prakat karte hue likhaa tha ki ''kavita kaa kaam chizon ke bich nae sambandh khojna he, vahiin chizon ko unki swatantra satta main dekhnaa bhi he
 "arun is able to do this in his poems, it is pleasant

 sharad pavaar ne sabit kii apni ahmiyatmaharashtra ke jariye modi-shah ko di matambhjhf ke chandani raat ko andheri raat main badladesh kii raajnneeti main 79 saal ke sharad pavaar jitna raajnneetik anubhav rakhane waalon kii sankhya ginati main hogi, lekin maharashtra kii raajnneeti main unhone jis tarah se apane raajnneetik anubhav or chaaturya kaa istemaal kar saare sankaton ko taal diya or rajya main pehali baar shivasena kii ensipi or congress ke samarthan se sarkaar ke gathan kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 Sharad Pawar, considered among the most ardent players of politics, has emerged as the biggest satrap of Maharashtra politics
 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko jaise hi kaha ki buudhvaar shaam 5 baje tak devendra fadanvis ko bahumat siddh karnaa hoga to bijepi ko saanp soongh gaya
 Shortly after the decision, the first Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar resigned
 phir devendra fadanvis ne bhi istipha de diya
 Only Sharad Pawar was at the center of Maharashtra's politics
 ye ladaai sidhe modi-shah ke khilaaf thi
 There may be many faces behind the resignation of Uddhav Thackeray's desolate Devendra Fadnavis and the success of formation of a new government, but in reality the success is of Sharad Pawar alone
 uddhav thakare to ajit pavaar kii shapath ke saath hi maayoos ho gaye the, lekin senior pavaar ne elaan kiya ki wo is ladaai ko manamafik anjaam tak le jaaenge
 Apart from him, no one had this courage nor such skill
 unhone tab tak dam nahin liya jab tak fadanvis kii chaar din kii chandani ko andheri raat main nahin badal diya
 Chief Minister may be going to be Uddhav Thackeray
 koi upmukhyamantri banegaa or koi vidhansabha kaa adhyaksh lekin meley ke nayak to sirf sharad pavaar the
 Swearing like a sand, it was secretly sneaked in the dark and it was piercing like sand in Pawar's eyes
 wo thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe the or usee din unhone thaan liya tha ki bijepi komaharashtramen benur karke rahenge
 He had also done PC after the oath of Fadnavis and said that the number is with us, we will form the government
 iske baad to sharad pavaar ne itani teji se pantare chale ki bijepi kaa dilli darbar unke iraadon ko bhaanp hi nahin paaya
 Its leaders felt that Pawar would finally lay down his arms
 wo samaj hi nahin paae ki chaar din kii uski chandani ko pavaar phir andheri raat main badal denge
 Ajit met with Sharad Pawar
 jor kaa jhatka dhire sesharad pavaar ke power panch ke saamne na to ajit pavaar kaa koi vaada bachaa or na hi bijepi kaa koi iraadaa bachaa
 Sharad Pawar explained to the BJP for the first time in recent years, what is spoiled in politics and explained it very comfortably
 teji se aage badhate hue ajit pavaar bhi nahin samaj paae ki ye rasta sirf sharad pavaar ke paas waapas jaataa he
 BJP stalwarts thought that Fadnavis had helped him, but his eyes were dazzled in the moonlight of power that only Sharad Pawar could manage Ajit Pawar
 isi ke saath devendra fadanvis chaar din kii chandani ho gaye
 The world's largest party had become very helpless in front of a single Pawar
 jo hairaani kii baat he wo ye ki ek se ek diggajon se bhari party andaja hi nahin laga pai ki pavaar ke paas kitni jaan he or jab wo apane par aaenge to uskaa kya haal karenge
 Pawar's family had to break up
 Now understand why Sharad Pawar was angry, because after the results, he was constantly saying that his party has the mandate to sit in the opposition
 isse bijepi ke bade netaaon ko laga ki pavaar khilne kii umr paar kar chuke hai
 He threw the dice of breaking both his house and the party
 beti supriya sule kaa dil ro padaa
 On this, Pawar was furious that he took an oath to overthrow Fadnavis
 darasal, ajit pavaar ko todakar bijepi ne soe hue sharad pavaar kii mahattvakankshaon ko jagaa diya tha, varna wo to lagaataar kah rahe the ki unhen vipaksh main baithne kaa janadesh mila he
 There is no work of the third in the first second number game
 lekin is bich bijepi ne ajit pavaar ko todakar sharad pavaar kii is sadashyata ko kamajori samaj baithi or yaheen usase wo bhul ho gai jisane usase satta kaa sapana to chin hi liya satta kii bhukhi party ke taur par badnaam bhi kar diya
 Sharad Pawar took away the cloak of age boundaries and announced directly through modi-amit Shah
 kasam khaane ke baad khatm ho gaya khelshapath grahan ke baad raat ko supreme court main arji lagaai gai
 The hearing started the next day
 vidhayakon ko hotel pahunchaaya gaya
 An attempt to sway Ajit Pawar and then on Monday came the moment when 163 Congress mlas of NCP Shiv Sena were taking the vows of unity
 isi samay bijepi ne haar maan lee thi
 The Supreme Court's decision was just a formality
 sharad pavaar ne jataa diya thaki wo is baaji ko haarane ke liye nahin khel rahe hai
 It was proved on Tuesday that Pawar was thinking right
 bijepi ne jin netaaon ke dam par apane aapako sharad pavaar par bees sabit hone kaa mugalata paala tha unhen pawad ne anaadi sabit kar diya tha
 In Maharashtra, the world of BJP was plundered

 com / jpxvlid2hp— Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk)december 20, 2018 If the Bharat Ratna and Padma Bhushan winner has to support a communal person like Narendra Modi, he should return his honor
 haal main narendra modi kii tarif karne vaali desh kii sur samraji lata mangeshkar ko ishaaron main ye naseehat di he mumbai congress ke adhyaksh janardan chandurkar ne
 This Congress leader says, 'I will not talk to Lata ji directly in this regard
 lekin unako aage bhi aisa karnaa he to ve bharat ratna kaa award lautaa den or nahin to samarthan karnaa band karen
 If he or any other person of honor does so in future, then i will write a letter to the PM himself to withdraw the award from him
 'janardan chandurkar ne kaha, 'is desh main har kisi ko bolne or apana vichaar rakhane kii aazaadee he, par sampradayik shakhson ke maamle main aisa nahin he
 If you want to support, then you return your Bharat Ratna or Padma Bhushan and then support
 'apni naseehat ko sahi tehraate hue unhone kaha, 'jin logon ko bharat ratna mila he unki desh main bahut izzat he
 People of all sections of the country love him very much
 main bhi pyaar karata hum
 But from the perspective of democracy, if the winners of Bharat Ratna and Padma Bhushan support any communal person then it is against the Constitution
 'narendra modi pradhanmantri bane: lata mangeshkarpune main ek kaarykram main swar kokila lata mangeshkar ne kaha he ki ve chaahati hai ki narendra modi pradhanmantri bane
 Modi was also present during this time

 dashahra or moharram ke baad bihar ke takreeban ek darjan jilon main sampradayik tanaav kii sthiti ke liye bijepi ne sidhe taur par nitish kumaar sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 BJP alleged that when the government knew that the festival of Dussehra and Moharram would be celebrated on the same day and started preparations for it 2 months in advance, then why the Bihar government failed to prevent communal tension
 bijepi netaa susheel modi ne sawaal uthaaya ki '2 maheene kii taiyaari ke baavjood sarkaar jameen parasampradayik tanavako rokane main puri tareeke se fail ho gai
 After all, why the law and order situation has deteriorated in so many districts despite the preparations? ”BJP has demanded that DM and SP should be immediately removed in the districts where communal tension has arisen
 bijepine bhojpur jile main shahbaad range ke diaiji mohammad rahamaan par aarope lagaaya ki unhone sampradayik tanaav ko rokane ke bajaae usko badhaava diya is vajah se unhen vahaan se turant hataaya jaae
 Sushil Modi said that this is the first time that a situation of communal tension has arisen in so many districts of Bihar and the government has to send experienced officers from Patna to control the situation
 'bijepi netaa susheel modi ne maang kii bihar sarkaar turant ekatarfa kaarywahi band kare or eksrvadaleey jaanchsmiti kaa gathan karen sabhi sampradayik tanaav kii ghatnaon kii jaanch karen or apni report de
 The Janata Dal United, on the other hand, blamed the BJP for all the communal tensions

 usne kitaaben kabhi nahin dekhin or na hi gita braille ke jariye padhi he
 The school teachers started memorizing the Gita to the children just in preparation for a competition about the fifteenth chapter of the Gita through the Chinmayi Mission
 lekin rida jehara kaa gita main aisa rujhaan bana kii use aaj gita kaa barahawein or pandrahaven adhyay ke sab shloke puri tarah munhajbani yaad hai
 Received the award, Jajehra has also got the state's first prize in this competition
 rida jehara ke liye yah baat koi myne nahin rakhata ki vah kis majahab ke granth ko pard or yaad kar rahi he use bas itnaa jarur ahsaas he ki ise yaad kar uske man ko shaanti milti he
 Happy with the daughter's success mother-pitarida Zehra's parents live in Lohianagar, Meerut, where she goes during holidays and festivals
 uske pita ne teen saal pehle uskaa admician is skool main karaayaa tha
 He had enrolled his daughter thinking that her daughter would be able to stand on her own feet after reading and writing
 lekin aaj jab unki beti ne unka naam roshan kar diya he
 But they feel that the success of the daughter, that reciting Gita by Rida will also send a message of brotherhood in the society
 kya kahana he rida jehara kaarida jehara ne bataaya ki mujhe ek comptishan ko lekar taiyaari kerani thi or uske liye gita kaa ek adhyay yaad karnaa behad jaruri tha
 When i started reciting the Gita, it made me feel very good
 baad main maine 12 or 15 adhyay bhi yaad kar liye or baaki bhi main yaad kar rahi hum
 What to say Rais Haider, father of Rida's parents, Karida Zehra, said that i feel very good that my daughter is reading Quran and Gita

 On the other hand, Rida Zehra's mother said that i am very excited that my daughter is earning a name
 rida kaa kaayal he skool prashasanarida kii lagan or kamyaabi ke baad skool prabandhan bhi usase bahut khush he
 Seeing the competition, he had all the children memorized verses of Geeta
 unhen bhi lagata tha ki gita ke shlokon ko yaad nahin rakh paaegi lekin rida jehara ke hunar ne sabko apana kaayal bana diya he
 After the failure of Rida, the school is now reminding the Hindu children of the Quran verses to erase the caste gap
 blind skool ke sanchaalak praveen sharma ne kaha ki ham log ni:shulk padhai karavaate hai
 In this, Gita Quran is taught by all

 Giving the heavy lift rocket the nickname 'bahubali', Sivan said that 'he is calm
 'sivan ne ieenes se kaha, main tanaav main nahin hum
 My family members have not seen any change in me, but everyone knows how important it is to launch Chandrayaan-2
 unhone kaha ki ise lekar mere parivaar ke sadasyon main bhi chintaa he
 Even during the first lunar mission, 'chandrayaan-1', when the rocket leaked while fueling, it was Sivan who calculated, predicted a possible fall and guaranteed that sufficient margins existed for a successful mission

 According to Sivan, the country has developed its capability to manufacture rockets and satellites and has provided many other services such as communications, climate forecasting
 sivan ne kaha, ham ab sarabhai dwaara boe gaye bijon kii fasal kaat rahe hai
 Now we have to provide and sow the seeds for future generations

 "they are well aware that despite the strong mood, there is no dearth of new voters among them
 rajpariwaar main paidaa hone ke baavjood ve sahajata se apana khunda sambhaal lete hai
 This year's election is going to be the last war between Amarinder and Badal
 shiromani akali dal ke gadhon main rahane vaale sikh kisaan purv mukhyamantri ko prakaash singh badal kii tulana main adhik 'vishwasaneey' maanate hai
 Says Punjabi writer Jas Singh, who lives in Faridkot, "although Badal is still highly respected in the villages and people have loyalty to him, he is no longer the ideal of the Jats
" unke bete sukhbir ko is tarah kaa sammaan paane ke liye lanbaa safar tay karnaa hoga
 The 80-year-old chief minister wearing an overcoat is battling for 12 to 14 election meetings daily
 overkot thik vaisaa he jise ve 2010 main apane chote bhai gurdas badal ke liye america se laae the
 Gurdas has now become a rival to younger brother and is contesting against him from Lambi assembly seat
 prakaash singh badal ko chalane-phirane main madad kii jarurat padati he or unhen sanbhaalane ke liye unke saath hameshaa paanch doctor rahete hai
 They also have a physiotherapist trained in Canada
 lambi, giddarbaha or bete ke nirvachan kshetra jalalabad main die gaye unke bhaashanon se is baat kaa ehsaas hota he ki log mukhyamantri ke rup main sukhbir ko nahin chaahate
 So they give confidence to the voters, "this is my last election
 yadi aap akali dal ko chunate hai to agle paanch saal ke liye main hi aapkaa mukhyamantri banuunga
 No one else will sit on this post
 ''keval 14
 3 per cent of the respondents support Sukhbir as the next chief minister while 28
 6 fisadi phir prakaash singh badal ko chaahate hai
 Amarinder is the choice of 32 percent people
 uttardaataaon main se 44 fisadi kaa maananaa he ki keval congress hi punjabi hiton ko puraa kar sakati he
 Despite his criticism, Sukhbir is campaigning very efficiently
 ve pratidwandviyon ke har kadam par najar rakhte hai or party ke bheetar baagiyon par kaabo paane ke liye athak parishram karte hai
 Amarinder accuses him of many
 unamem ek aarope yah bhi he ki congress ke baagiyon ko daud main banaae rakhane ke liye shiromani akali dal unhen paise detaa he
 Sukhbir dismissed the allegations and encouraged the enthusiasm of his supporters in Adampur near Jalandhar on 18 January
 saath hi, unhone apane congressi pratidwandvi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Sukhbir said, "I can say with a claim that the Captain thinks that Sultanpur Lodhi (a constituency in Kapurthala district) is in Pakistan
" unhone us desh kii kai yatraaen kii hai
 "he also quips that the state Congress president is friends with a Pakistani woman journalist
" patiala ke purv rajpariwaar ke vanshaj 69 varshiya amarinder mukhyamantri kii kurrsi par do baar baithne vaale punjab congress ke ekmaatr netaa ke rup main itihaas bana sakate hai
 He cites the example of other Congress ruled states like Haryana where the Chief Minister returned to power
 saath hi, ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''antat yah sonia ji kaa faisla hoga ki mukhyamantri koun banegaa
 "his wife Praneet Kaur as a potential chief minister is often discussed in Delhi and Punjab
 philhal, ve videsh mantralay main rajyamantri hai or unhen dilli ke lodhi estate main bangala mila he
 Pranit says, "I have heard that too, but never heard from any authorized person
" '' saath hi, ve yah bhi kahati hai, ''mukhyamantri ke rup main amarinder shrimati gandhi kii pehali pasand honge
 "nowadays she is taking time out of her responsibility as a minister and handling the election campaign of her son Raninder Singh in Samana constituency
" apni tajposhi kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue amarinder ne aarthik punarutthan, krishi, udyog, police, shiksha or swasthya sareekhe shashan ke mahatvapurn kshetron main bhavi nitiyaan tay karne ke liye kaary samoohon kii sthapana kii thi
 The suggested policies of experts have been exaggerated in the Congress manifesto

 The party has promised to continue and expand the existing welfare schemes

 The SAD-BJP coalition government may have filed several cases against Amarinder and Congressmen, but the voters of Punjab believe that the state government has completely failed to curb corruption
 64 fisadi kaa kahana he ki unke vidhayak bhrasht hai
 PPP President Manpreet Badal alleges that his Tayaji and cousin are themselves corrupt
 gauratlab he ki manpreet shiromani akali dal sarkaar main vitt mantri the jinhen aktubar, 2010 main hataa diya gaya tha
 He told his supporters via Twitter in November, "the manner in which the Badal family took over Punjab's luxury bus business is an example of abuse of power
" '' arab vidroh or anna hajaare se prabhavit manpreet ko yakeen he ki ''punjab main badlaav kii hawa bah rahi he

" yathasthiti badalane kaa vinamr manpreet kaa vaada shaayad apane chachere bhai or tayaji ko satta se hataane tak simit he
 The India today-org opinion poll estimates that PPP may cut 5 per cent of votes from Shiromani Akali Dal's vote bank
 isse sattarudh gathbandhan ke satta main lautne kii koshish naakaam ho sakati he
 In the list of potential chief ministers, where Manpreet is ranked fifth after Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni, his party is not considered a serious challenge

 There are lakhs of followers of this cult in the Malwa region of Punjab which can influence the election results
 mana jaataa he ki unhone 2007 ke chunaav main bhi nateezon ko prabhavit kiya tha
 There are about 300 such self-proclaimed religious sects in Punjab which mainly influence the way their Dalit followers vote

 Virender Sehwag relinquished the captaincy of Delhi Daredevils after last season, but this aggressive opener believes that his decision will not have any effect on his attitude
 sahvaag ipel ke chathe satr main ek baar phir team kii ummiido kaa bhaar apane kandhe par uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 Sehwag said in an interview to PTI, "I don't think it makes any difference whether i am captaining the team or not
" captaini ne kabhi mere khel ko prabhavit nahin kiya
 i never felt pressurized on my batting while captaining the team
 yah poochne par ki kya srilanka ke mahela jayavardhane ke team kii kaman sanbhaalane se unke upar se bhaar kam hoga, sahvaag ne kaha, captain ke rup main maine kabhi dabaav mahasoos nahin kiya, ballebaaji ke prati meraa ravaiya hameshaa samaan rahata he
 Captaincy and performance are two different things for Sehwag, which should not be mixed
 daaen haath ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, maine hameshaa kaha he ki captaini or pradarshan do alag-alag chijen hai
 If you talk about the pressure of captaincy, then i had scored five consecutive half-centuries in the last season of IPL and the highest runs for Delhi Daredevils
 pichley satr main 495 ran banane vaale sahvaag ke lagaataar paanch ardhashatak ipel record tha, lekin is ballebaaj ko lagata he ki is saal yah record tut saktaa he
 Sehwag said after talking to children in ndtv's 'marks for Sports' campaign, a player can break this record this year
 tippaniyan Sehwag admitted that England batsman Kevin Pietersen, who was ruled out of the tournament due to a knee injury, would miss, as his role in helping the team reach the last four last season was also important
 unhone kaha, capi bade maukon par ran banane vaale khilaadi hai or nishchit taur par unki kami khalegi, lekin hamaare paas anya khilaadi bhi hai, jo jimmedaari uthaate hue yogadan de sakate hai
 We have 10 level foreign players and whoever replaces him in the playing XI, will get a chance to earn a name on the big stage
 agar vah maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue apni ahmiyat sabit karte hai, to ham trophy jeet sakate hai
 Asked about preparations before the first match, the 34-year-old opener said, "I feel very good and i am 100 percent fit

 online paise transfarkarna jitna aasaan he, utani hi jokhim bharaa bhi
 Through this facility, money can be transferred from any corner of the world in just one click
 lekin agar thodi si bhi chook ho gai to ye rakam galat insaan ko pahunch sakati he
 Therefore, the more easily the money reaches another account, the more trouble there is in claiming those money back
 to online mani transfar karte vakt in baton kaa khyaal rakhen:-nayaa benificiari jodate vakt rahen alertvaise to benificiari kaa acount number do baar isliye tip karnaa hota he taaki misamatch hone par gadabadi kaa pataa chal sake
 But if for the first time you have written the account number of the beneficiary as a precaution, then copy paste it instead of typing it again
 -benificiari kaa mobile number bank ko dembenificiari kaa bhi mobile number bank ko jarur den
 With this, the bank will inform you and the money in whose account, that is, the transaction will be reported to the beneficiary on the mobile
 -kooling period main naa transfar karen paseagar nae benificiari ko paise bhej rahe hai, to uske naam kii entry karne ke aadhe ghante ke baad hi paise transfar kar sakate hai
 This is called a cooling period
 -galat transaction kii soochna fouran bank ko denriserv bank ke niyam ke mutabik online tranjection main hui gadabadi ke liye graahak khud jimmedaar he
 Therefore, in such cases, the bank does not recall the money from the beneficiary account
 phir bhi agar isaki jaankaree tranjection ke ghantbhar main bank ko den, to karrwai ho sakati he
 It is easier to get money back if the person who sent the money and whose account was sent to both the accounts are in the same bank

 Members of the press club had written a letter to the local election official alleging that BJP state in-charge Ravindra Raina tried to bribe journalists at a press conference held last week
 lekin bhaajapa ne in aaropon ko khandan karte hue kaha ki unhone rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman kii kshetra main hone vaali raily ke liye patrakaron ko aamantran patr diya tha
 The party said it would file a defamation suit against the journalists
 ek patrkaar rinchen angmo ne daawa kiya ki party ke ek varisht netaa ne bhaajapa ke rajya prabharee ke saamne uske sahit chaar patrakaron ko lipaphe die the
 The leader also said that they should not open the envelope in the hall
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe sandigdh laga or maine use kholaa
 i noticed that there were some 500 rupee notes in it
 maine vah lipapha lautaa diya, lekin unhone lene se manaa kar diya
 After this i put it on the table
 ' sisitivi main ek mahila teble par lipapha chhodkar jaati hui dikh rahi hai
 a BJP leader said, 'we do not believe in giving bribes to anyone
 ham patrakaron ko bada sammaan karte hai
 The BJP has never done such a thing and we will never do it even further, 'the Election Commission has taken steps for an FIR in the matter following complaints from journalists
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki shikaayat ko sthaneey court bhej diya gaya he or vah exiaar darj karne ke liye court ke aadesh kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you, BJP state president Ravindra Raina had threatened that a defamation suit will be filed if the Press Club does not publicly apologize
 raina ne kaha tha, ‘bhaajapa is tarah ke aaropon ko bardaasht nahin karegi
 If the Press Club does not publicly apologize, it will file a defamation suit in the High Court
 ' unhone kaha ki aarope ‘niraadhaar or dushprachaar' hai tathaa yah ‘raajnneeti se prerit kadam' he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that due to the implementation of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, his state would suffer a loss of Rs 50,000 crore and he wants the Center to make up for it
 modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad nitish kumaar ne pehali baar aadhikarik rup se unase mulaakaat kii
 Nitish Kumar's party JDU severed its 17-year-old relationship with the BJP in 2013 after Modi was declared bjp's prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 pradhanmantri ke saath is mulaakaat ke baad nitish ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone 14wein vitt ayog kii siforeeshon ke kriyanvayan kaa mudda uthaaya or kaha ki isse rajya ko anumaanit 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 He said that there has been a decrease in the share in centrally sponsored schemes
 nitish ne kaha, kul milakar yah bihar ko nuksaan he
 Therefore, i have requested that Bihar should be compensated for this
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, doosraa mudda jo unhone uthaaya, vah yah tha ki varsh 2000 main bihar ke bantwaare ke baad pichhadaa kshetra anudaan kosh (biarjief) ke tahat rajya ko milane vaali vishesh sahaayta par bhi ab prashnchinh lag gaya he
 Our doubts should be removed
 hamen vah raashi milani chahie or bhavishya main bhi yah raashi milti rahani chahie
 The Prime Minister's Office called today's meeting a courtesy call
 bihar main nitish kumaar dwaara 23 march ko bulaai gai ek sarvadaleey baithak ne vitt ayog kii siforeeshon ke chalate rajya ko hone vaale takreeban 50 hajaar karod rupee ke nuksaan ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The BJP boycotted this meeting
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main netritv kaa mudda tay to ho gaya he, par sabane us netritv ko sweekaar bhi kar liya ho, aisa lagata nahin
 Generation change is not easy in any organization
 maamla rajnatik dal kaa ho to yah or mushkil hota he
 If you talk about a political party that has a strong possibility of coming to power, then you can only imagine how serious the problem can be
 pichley kareeb saal bhar se bijepi isi mushkil se rou-ba-rou he
 The combined effort of the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has made Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi the bjp's prime ministerial candidate
 lekin party main sheersh par abhi aise log hai, jinaki najar main netritv kaa mudda khulaa hua he
 They are just waiting for the opportunity
 yahi kaaran he ki bijepi ke satta main aane kii sambhaavna ke saath hi bhavi pradhanmantri ke naamon kii bhi charchaa shuru ho jaati he
 Due to this discussion, it is said that there is a 160 club in BJP
 iskaa arth he ki party main aise log hai jinhen party kii kam kamyaabi main apane liye avasar najar aata he
 These are the same people who, except Narendra Modi as prime ministerial candidate, were not ready to hand over the command of the National Election Campaign Committee
 unka tark tha ki modi ko netritv saunpane se desh bhar main ek sampradayik dhruvikaran ho jayega or bijepi alag-thalag pad jaaegi
 It was said that this decision should be stopped at least till the assembly elections of the four states
 par faisla rukaa nahin or vidhansabha chunaav main nuksaan kii bajaay phayda hi hua
 During the announcement of Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, it was feared that the party would not get new allies
 ab is samay sthiti yah he ki modi ke netritv main bijepi ko jitne sahyogi mili hai, utane 2009 main laalkrishna adwani ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke samay bhi nahin mili the
 But what is the leader who gives up so easily
 ati ashavad or aseemit mahatvakanksha netaa kii sabase badi puunji hoti he
 And BJP is the party of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose famous line of poetry, i will not give up, i will not give up
 tabhi to dekhie na, bijepi main adwani ke netritv main nai raar thaanane ke liye kai log baithe hai
 There is no difference between the target of these and BJP opponents
 donon kaa lakshya ek hi haih modi ko rokna
 Modi's fight is on both the inside and outside fronts
 fark sirf itnaa he ki baahar kii ladaai kaa ve khulaa jawaab de sakate hai, andaravaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye unhen party main apane saathiyon kii jarurat he
 The internal battle in the BJP has not stopped, it has been postponed till the election results
 bijepi main pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron kii kami nahin he
 There is no retirement word in Advani's dictionary
 so yah ramarathi abhi paidal nahin hua he
 Their condition is that they do not hide clearly, they do not come forward
 pradhanmantri banane kii mahatvakanksha aaj bhi jor maar rahi he
 There are more arrows in his quiver
 unako khaarij kiya to sushamaa swaraj saamne khadi najar aaengi
 Sushma is constantly engaged in making herself the center of gravity of Modi's opponents inside the party
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh modi ke saath khadey hai lekin 16 may ke baad daanv laga to chaukaa maarane se kyon chuknaa chahenge
 It is not that Modi does not know all this
 ve apane virdohi kheme kii gatividhiyon ke prati bahut satark hai
 This is the reason why as soon as the party's national president Rajnath Singh tweeted that "this time BJP government, Modi camp became active
" aadhe ghante ke andar hi unhen naare ko badalanaa padaa
 He re-tweeted "this time Modi government", now the question is that if BJP gets 160 or 170 seats in the general elections, can any other leader of the party be Prime Minister besides Modi? The answer is both yes and no
 modi kheme vaale iskaa jawaab naa main or unke virdohi haa main denge
 But is it possible? Such an attempt was made once in 1989
 jab vishwanath pratap singh ke netritv main janata dal ne chunaav ladaa or chunaav baad chandrashekhar ko pradhanmantri banane kii koshish hui
 No need to tell what happened to him
 bijepi ke 160 club kaa sabase bada tark yahi he ki bijepi itane par hi ruk gai to sarkaar banane ke liye nae saathi isi shart par aaenge ki modi pradhanmantri nahin honge
 Logically this seems fine
 lekin vyaavhaarik nazariye se or itihaas ke aaine main dekhen to yah daawa kamjor najar aata he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not even get companions in 162 seats
 182 par mil gaye
 It will be difficult to deny Modi's contribution in all the seats BJP gets
 maan bhi len ki modi ke naam par nae saathi nahin milenge to kya bijepi iske liye apane sabase lokapriy netaa kii qurbaani dene ko taiyaar ho jaaegi? usase bhi bada sawaal he ki party ko 112 se 160 yaa 170 siton tak pahunchane vaale modi kya itani aasaani se dilli chhodkar gandhinagar laut jaaenge? is naatak ke agle drishy ke liye 16 may kaa intjaar kiijie

 akshay ko neshnal aword se nawaja gaya he
 Due to Akshay Kumar's excellent acting, his bag is full of films
 alam ye he ki shahrukh khan bhi akshay kumaar ke saath film bananaa chahta hai
 In an interview with website DNA, Shah Rukh expressed his wish that he will work with Akshay

 akshay ko neshnal aword die jane par uthe sawaal par to priyadarshan ne di safaiapako bataa den ki pichley dinon neshnal aword ke elaan ke baad se hi akshay kumaar par bayaanbaji jari he
 On social media some people are alleging that Akshay has received this award due to his proximity to Priyadarshan, the jury head of the National Award
 ab priyadarshan ne is par safai di he
 He told why no people are thinking like this
 pichhali baar jab ramesh sippi juri head the, tab amitabh bachchan ko 'piku' ke liye best actor kaa aword mila tha or jab prakaash jha ne ajay devgan ko aword ke liye chunaa tha, tab to kisi ne shor nahin machaaya
 He further said that Akshay has been given the Best Actor Award for good performance in his two films 'airlift' and 'rustom'
 ye mere akele kaa faisla nahin tha, ye juri kaa faisla tha
 One is given for performance drama and the other for real life story
 lekin niyam ke mutabik keval ek hi film ko mension kar sakate hai, isliye 'rustam' ko mension kiya gaya he
 But this award has been given to him for both films
 aapako bataa den ki akshay, priyadarshan kii 'garam masala', 'hera pheri', 'bhaagam bhaag', 'de danaa dan', 'khatta meetha' jaisi filmon main kaam kar chuke hai

 film queen ke nirdeshkavikas bahalpar yon shoshan ke aarope lagane vaali mahila ne apane affidavit main kaha he ki vah sabhi aaropon par kaayam hai
 The woman is the one who accused Bahl of sexual misconduct in an interview with the Huffington Post
 durvyavhaar kaa maamla goa main bombai velvet (2015) ke pramotional tour ke dauraan kaa he
 The woman also said that she had given information to Anurag Kashyap in this matter but at that time he did nothing
 baad main anuraag ne twit kar maafee bhi maangi thi
 What happened in the Bombay High Court? According to reports, the Bombay High Court heard Bahl's plea in which he had filed a defamation case of Rs 10 crore against his former partners Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwani and three media institutions
 mahila ne court main apane kanoonee salaahkaar navroj sarwai or vakil neha mehara ke jariye ek affidavit daakhil kiya he, jisamen unhone apane aaropon par barkaraar rahane kii baat kahi he
 Sarawai says that after reading the news in newspapers, my client had expressed reluctance to submit affidavit as it was a case of sexual harassment
 sarwai kaa kahana he- "yadi hamaari baat par bharosa nahin kiya jaataa to ye hamaari kshati kaa apmaan hoga
 My clients stand by their statements
 yah gambhir aarope hai
 "justice SJ Kathavala has also asked Vikas Bahl, Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwani to file their affidavit by 21 November
 bataa den ki ye maamla 2015 kaa he
 Kangana had also accused Vikas of the development, Kangana Ranaut, who had worked in Vikas Bahl's film "queen", also shared her experiences about development
 queen main kaam kar chukin abhinetri nayani dikshit ne bhi vikaas par durvyahaar ke aarope lagaae the
 Later, Vikas Bahl's case reached the court
 supreme court se sarkaar ko bada jhatka laga he
 The court has rejected the government's plea urging the revoked leaders to reconsider the ban on contested elections
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad do saal yaa zyada kii sajaa hote hi saansad yaa vidhayak kii sadsyta chhine jane kaa aadesh barkaraar rahegaa
 However, the Supreme Court has accepted another reconsideration petition of the government in its ruling which banned the election of a leader while in jail
 is yachika par ab 23 oktober ko agali sunwaayee hogi
 The court has issued notices to the Central Election Commission, the Government of Bihar, and the Jan Chowkidar institution in this regard
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne ek aitihaasik faisla sunaaya tha ki jin netaaon ko 2 saal yaa usase adhik kii sajaa sunai jaaegi, uski sadsyta tatkaal radd ho jaaegi
 Yes, if the decision of the Supreme Court comes in their favor, then their membership will be automatically withdrawn
 itnaa hi nahin, jail main rahete hue kisi netaa ko vot dene kaa adhikaar bhi nahin hoga or naa hi ve chunaav lard sakenge
 Because they will not have the right to enroll after going to jail

 This violence drove nearly 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh - 60% are children! Many months later they are still highly vulnerable, living in overcrowded camps with no idea when or where they will ever belong

 com / q61slx10va sunanda pushkar kii maut ke maamle main hai court ne lagaai dilli police ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai he
 The court told the police in a strict tone that even after more than three years, you have not reached any conclusion
 court ne poocha ki 2 hafte main bataaen ki cese band karnaa he yaa chargeshit fil kerani he
 The High Court expressed displeasure over the investigation into the death of Nesunanda Pushkar, saying that till 2014 neither you have any status report nor have you been able to file the charge sheet
 na hi aap closer report laga paae hai, ye kya he, kyon 3 saal se upar kaa vaqt biit jane ke baad bhi aap kisi nattejey par nahin pahunche
 Subramanian Swamy said that this case is related to money laundering besides murder, which is very important to be investigated
 ashanka he ki sunanda kaa murder isi liye kiya gaya ho
 Why is the police wasting their time on which poison was given? jaanch is baat kii honi chahie ki jehar kyon or kisne diya
 Therefore, the court should monitor this investigation
 hai court ne kaha ye koi acchhee parampara nahin he ki court maamalon kii nigaraanee karen, lekin ham ye jarur jaananaa chaahate hai ki jaanch abhi kis stage par he, maamle main ho kya rahaa he
 Delhi Police said that the investigation is being done in a very scientific manner
 ham cese me nishkarsh ke bahut nazadik he
 The High Court gave 2 weeks time to the Delhi Police to tell them what they wanted to do in this case finally
 court ne kaha ki police is maamle main ab tak chargeshit bhi court main daakhil nahin kar pai he
 Therefore, the case should be transferred to CBI
 court is maamle main dilli police or centre sarkaar ko bhi notice bhej chuki he
 Delhi Police says that it is about to complete its investigation in this case
 haalanki police ne court ko die jawaab me ye bhi kaha he ki agar maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpi jaati he, to unhen koi etraj nahin he
 It is common in Bollywood to have different reasons for having a breakup and then separation
 lekin rithik roshan or kangana ranot ke bich kaa maamla kuch zyada hi tool pakad gaya he
 After all, it is the case of well-known superstars
 personal life main ye donon hi khaase jatke khaae hue hai
 While Kangana has had many breakups, her childhood love Suzanne Sritik's marriage has broken
 kahaan se shuru hua maamla:kangana ne pinkavila ko ek intervyuu dete hue 'sili eks' shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Actually, some time back news came that Kangana was removed from the film 'aashiqui 3' only on Hrithik's suggestion
 jab kangana se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe kai ajeeb afvaahen sunne ko mil rahi hai
 Even a guesser can guess where these rumors are coming from? i do not know why the Xs do such crazy things to get your attention
 meri taraf se ye chapter khatm ho chukaa he or ab main un baton kii kabr khodna nahin chaahati
 Right after this, Tritik had said by tweeting that the women with whom the media is referring to my relationship is more likely to have a relationship with a pope
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kangana ne rithik kaa ek baar bhi naam nahin liya phir unhen itani mirchi kyon lagi
 By the way, there are 5 things in this case that Kangana Kapalra seems to be more heavy - 1
 bollywood ectorritishapani image ko lekar kuch zyada hi contious hai
 Even if the mistake is his, but he always makes every effort to prove himself right
 kanganahi nahin pehali patni sujain ke saath alag hone kaa elaan karte vakt bhi rithik ne sujain ke upar hi rishte ko khatm karne kaa dosha madha tha
 Not only this, a statement was issued to Suzanne giving the real reason for the rift in the relationship, on which Suzanne was very angry
 2
 Hrithik had sent a notice to Kangana in February for an unconditional apology for the Silly Ax statement
 iske baad kangana ne palatwaar karte hue notice bheja ki unhone yah nahin kaha tha ki sili eks rithik hai
 Now when Kangana had the title of Silly X, it is not clear, then how Hrithik himself accepted himself as his X
 3
 In his notice, Mritik has emphasized that he has worked with Kangana in two films
 unka kahana he ki peshewar rishton ke alaava unke bich soshal, personal yaa kisi bhi tarah kaa koi intimet relation nahin he
 The thinking is that when Kangana did not comment about their relationship, then why did Hrithik explain about it? 4
 It is well known that out of both, it is Kangana who is seen talking openly about their relationship or any matter
 lekin rithik, filmein hon yaa phir personal life, hameshaa in sab par koi bhi statement dete vakt asahaj hi najar aate hai
 This is the reason that when Hrithik asked Kangna to apologize, Kangana gave a clear answer that if he wants to do this then he will have to make his point known because i don't mind blackmailing and threats
 5
 Not only in films, but in real life Bhikanganabul is absolutely queen
 kangana ke paksh main ek or baat jaati he ki unke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 Whether it is real life or reel life, Kangana never worries about her image
 na to unhen is baat kaa dar he ki is controvarsi ke chalate unhen filmein nahin milengi or na hi vah sochati hai ki unka parivaar or unke phans kya sochenge
 After a secret meeting with Pakistani National Security Advisor (NSA) Nasir Khan Janjua in Bangkok in December last year, Indian NSA Ajit Doval has met him in Paris in January this year

 Former South African captain Graeme Smith, one of the finest captains in the cricket world, has hinted at a comeback
 bharat ke khilaaf test siries main team kii sharmnaak haar ke baad purv captain ne kaha ki apane purv saathi khilaadiyon ko itnaa kharaab khelte dekh vah antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas ke faisle par punarvichaar kar sakate hai
 India beat South Africa 3–0 in a four-match Test series
 masters champiens ligamein virgo super kings team ke liye khilne ja rahe smith ne kaha ki is haar ko dekhne ke baad vah sanyas kaa faisla badalane ke liye gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahe hai
 He told 'the National' newspaper, 'who knows KCL should prove to be a means of return to international cricket
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhase yah sawaal kai baar poocha jaataa he
 It keeps wandering in the mind
 khaskar jab aap team ko is tarah jujhate dekhte hai to lagata he ki aap yogadan de sakate hai
 lets see
 main phir se abhyaas karke emsiel kii taiyaari karuunga
 "I am in a dilemma as to whether i should return to international cricket or not," Smith said
 main 34 saal kaa hum or 33 kii umr main sanyas le liya tha
 The question was always whether i could play three to four years
 mujhe pataa he ki main abhi antarrashtriya cricket khel saktaa hum
 i am confuse
 emsialke baad dekhte hai
 Regarding the defeat in India, Smith said that the South African team had created a wicket of wickets and could not recover from that pressure
 unhone kaha, ‘jab aap kathin viketon par khelte hai to chaahe ve hari hon, seem yaa turn lene vaali, margin bahut kam hota he or ham usee margin par haar gaye
 "he said," i think we over-thought about the wickets
 wicket kathin the lekin donon tiimon ko un par khelnaa tha
 Smith said that after the 72-day long India tour, the team now needs to relax
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane saal ke aakhir main khud par kuch dabaav bana liya
 Now the England team has to tour South Africa, so the players should rest now
 ve lambey samay se bharat main he or ab unhen parivaar ke saath relax karnaa chahie
 South Africa's Test captain Hashim Amla failed in the series but Smith said he should not be criticized too much
 unhone kaha, ‘main amala kaa bahut sammaan karata hum
 This series was tough and the runs were not easy
 amala ko samay dene kii jarurat he
 This was his first challenge as a captain and how he would overcome it would test him
 use vah mauka diya janaa chahie
 He said, "now a four-test series is to be played against England
 bataur captain yah amala ke liye bada chalange hogi
 Significantly, in the month of February this year, there were signs of Smith's return to domestic cricket, but the franchise Titan refused
 smith ke is bayaan ke baad emsiel ko cricketrs kii niyukti kii apni policy par ek baar phir dhyaan dene kii jarurat hogi kyonki is lig main khilne ke liye unka antarrashtriya cricket se ritair hona jaruri he
 However, the cricketers whose names were announced by the franchise on Monday included the names of West Indies cricketer Santoki (30 years) and South Africa's Richard Levy (27 years)
 in cricketrs ne abhi tak antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa tak nahin kii he
 Apart from this, Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood of Pakistan also fall in this category
 antarrashtriya cricket main greem smingale farvari main 35 saal ke hone ja rahe greem smith kaa antarrashtriya cricket main shandaar pradarshan rahaa he
 He played 48 for 117 Test matches played for Africa
 26 kii ausat se 9,265 ran banaae hai

) get the highest allocation
 centre sarkaar kii skiimon main kuch to 15 saal or kuch 25 saal puraani hai
 After adding the schemes of the states, the number becomes very large
 jaruratmandon tak nahin pahunchataa phaaydayah dard purana he ki skiimon ke phaayde jaruratmandon tak nahin pahunchate
 The government's own calculation shows that the districts where the poorest reside have the least benefits of the six major schemes (housing Scheme, Sarva Shiksha, mid-day Meal, Village Road, MGNREGA, Swachh Bharat), and where the poor were less Reached more resources
 yahi vajah he ki kareeb 40 fisadi lakshith logon ko rashan pranali or 65 fisadi jaruratmandon ko manaregaa kaa laabh nahin miltaa
 This is also the condition of other schemes ie direct theft
 modi sarkaar kii taaja skiimon (ujjwala, saubhaahgya) ke aankade bhi isaki tasdik karte hai
 First stop the big subsidy scheme If political parties are promising income guarantee, then show courage to stop five big subsidy schemes
 keval petro or anaaj sabsidi par jidipi kaa 1
 It costs 48 percent
 aisa karte hi logon ke haath main sidhe dhan pahunchane kaa rasta khul saktaa he or sarkaar kaa vishaal dhaancha simit ho jayega
 If the allocation of resources to the states is also linked to this and the state's scheme spending is limited, then this reform will actually bring budgetary discipline instead of increasing expenditure
 logon ke khate main sidhe dhan pahunchane kii vyavastha (debiti) sthapit ho chuki he
 The biggest proof of success of LPG subsidy in bank account
 is tark ke samarthan main paryaapt adhyayan uplabdh hai ki logon ke haath main dhan arthvyavastha main maang ko badhaata hagareebon ko nunatam aay ke saath shiksha, swasthya aadi jaruri sevaaon main nijee pratispardhaa or upabhoktaaon ke liye laagat main kami jaruri he
 This can be secured by policy and regulatory measures
 yah sudhaar bhi lambey samay se lataka hua he
 The government's spending and the transparent regulation of the market are what the economy needs
 sudhaar aprihaary he, rahul karen yaa modijis tarah 1991 main bharat kii aarthik nitiyaan lagbhag charmara chuki thim, thik vahi haalat sarkari kharch or kalyaan skiimon kii he
 The biggest challenge of this effort is their symbolism
 skiimon kii bheed ke kaaran kuch sau rupye kii pension, choti-si sahaayta yaa maamuli sa beemaa hi mumkin he
 So people are not interested in them
 to desh ko tej aarthik vikaas ke saath adhiktam ek yaa do bade hitlabh vaali kalyaan scimen chahie
 No matter whether Modi or Congress do this, but this reform is inevitable

 Let me tell you, the Supreme Court on Monday expressed displeasure over the Election Commission's action against the BSP chief Mayawati and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for their allegedly malicious speeches during the election campaign
 iske saath hi court ne kaha tha ki vah adarsh aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke maamle main ayog ke adhikaron ke daayre par vichaar kiya jaayegaa
 a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Sanjeev Khanna, taking cognizance of the speeches allegedly circulating the two prominent leaders of UP during the election campaign, sought to know from the Commission what action it has taken so far
 isse pehle ayog ne is maamle main khud ko ‘dantavihin' bataaya tha
 The bench had said, 'you tell me what you are doing
 hamen bataayen ki aapane kya karrwai kii he
 'with this, the Supreme Court summoned a representative of the Commission on Tuesday morning at half past ten

 The Election Commission swung into action within a few hours of the court's stern stance and strongly condemned the communal remarks of the two leaders and barred them from campaigning
 ayog ne adityanath ko 72 ghante or basapa supremeo mayawati ko 48 ghante ke liye chunaav prachaar se baahar kar diya
 After this, the Election Commission also stopped Union Minister Maneka Gandhi and senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan from campaigning in the case of making controversial statements from Tuesday

 Amit Shah emerged as a big face in national politics after the BJP got 73 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh on the basis of his Chanakya policy in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ab adhyaksh amit shah ab rajyasabha main jaaenge
 Amit Shah has nominated for the Rajya Sabha
 aankadon kii maane, to unhen chunaav jeetne main koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 This will be the first time that Amit Shah will become MP
 amit shah ke rajyasabha main jane ke kuch bade myne hai -1
 Lack of big face after Naidu Rajya Sabha has lost a big face due to former Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu being nominated as vice-president
 agar amit shah rajyasabha main aate hai, to arun jetali ke baad ve vahaan par sabase bada cheharaa honge
 Amit Shah is also low on PM Modi's trust, so this bet of modi-shah can prove to be effective for BJP
 2
 Now the Chanakya Nitianda government has an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha in the Rajya Sabha but its position in the Rajya Sabha is weak
 amit shah ko maujuuda daur kii raajnneeti kaa chanakya kaha jaataa he, yahi kaaran he ki amit shah agar rajyasabha main aate hai
 So it will be good for NDA, Amit Shah will be able to surround the opposition in Rajya Sabha on the basis of his policy
 3
 Big position will be found in government! Many big ministries are vacant in Modi government
 arun jetali vitt mantralay or raksha mantralay sambhaal rahe hai
 At the same time, after the resignation of Venkaiah Naidu, another big face was lost
 agar amit shah rajyasabha aate hai, to sambhav he ki unhen sarkaar main koi bada pad diya ja saktaa he
 4
 party ke baad sarkaar main modi-shah jodijab se bijepi main modi yug shuru hua he, tabhi se sabhi diggaj ek kinare ho gaye hai
 The party consists entirely of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi
 agar amit shah rajyasabha ke jariye sarkaar main entry lete hai, to party ke baad ab sarkaar main bhi modi-shah kii jodi kaam karegi
 Since Amit Shah is very close to PM Modi, it is possible that he will get a big post and Shah has the number 2 position in the government as well
 5
 No more president after 2019! Amit Shah is currently serving his second term as BJP President
 bijepi main niyam he ki koi vyakti do se adhik baar party adhyaksh nahin ban saktaa he
 Therefore, Amit Shah is already preparing to be ready for a major position in national politics, and to hold his own

 What is the point of taking various criminal cases like misbehavior, stealing from women, Arms Act and TADA on their heads? ek aise insaan ko aam aadmi kaa hawala dekar desh ke bade jane maane reality sho main entry dena kya sahi he? aam logon ke liye plateform kahe jane vaale reality sho kaa makasad ek aam insaan ko khaas banane yaa yun kahen ki kisi ke kariyar ko aage le jane main madad karnaa hi bataaya jaataa he

 Because how a criminal can entertain people on national TV by resorting to lies, no one would want to see them on their TV screen knowing their reality
 phir pehle hi episod main jis tarah kii baaten baba ne aakanksha sharma ke liye kahi, kya uske baad unka sho main tikna sahi he

 If it is in the minds of Bigg Boss fans that seeing Swami Om, Priyanka Jaggaya Lokesh Kumari on screen is really a waste of time and blasphemy, then they should blame it on Big Boss and Salman Khan

 har kisi ko kamyaabi chahie
 Those who succeed find a way to keep it intact
 par safalataa ke raste main samasyaayein hai
 Big target, then big challenges too
 kai baar chunautiyon ke aage man haarane lagata he
 The means we possess seem minor
 aise main man main andeh uthanaa ekadam swaabhaavik he
 a surefire way to overcome such doubts and achieve success is told in Ramacharitmanas's Lanka
 prasang he ram-ravan yuddh kaa
 In the battlefield, Lankapati Ravana has all the means, while Rama is under the control of Vanvasi
 pairon main juute tak nahin
 In such a situation, there was doubt about the victory in Vibhishan's mind
 jab ram ne vibhishana ko samajhaayaa, tab jaakar vibhishana ko gyaan hua
 In today's era, the relevance of this infallible mantra of victory increases even more
 isamen bataae gaye raste par chalane ke prayaas bhar se jeet kii raah aasaan ho jaati he
 It is entirely a matter of karma and conduct
 jab bhi man main andeh aae, to iske paath se andeh avashya hi dur ho jate hai
 Below are the lines of Ramcharitmanas and their meanings
 kahani khud spasht ho ja rahi he
 
 
 Ravanu Rathi Birath Raghubira
 dekhi bibhishan bhayu adhira
 
 adhik priti man bha sandeha
 Saneha including saying Bandi Charan 
 Vibhishana became impatient after seeing Ravana riding the chariot and Shriram without a chariot
 shriram se adhik priti hone ke kaaran unke man main yah andeh paidaa ho gaya ki ve bhala is ravan ko jeetenge kaise
 Nath na rath nahin pad post trana
 kehi bidhi jitab vir balvaanaa
 
 sunhu sakha kah kripanidhana
 Jahin jai hoi so come to sandan 
 Vibhishan worshiped Ramji and said, 'O Nath, you have neither chariot, nor armor on your body, nor shoes in your feet
 aise main aap ravan ko kaise jeet sakenge?’ is par shriram ne kaha, ‘he mitra! suno, jise rath se jeet milti he, vah rath kuch duusare tarah kaa hota he
 'sauraj Dhiraj Tehi Ratha Chaka
 satya‘ sil drudh dhwaja pataakaa
 
 bal bibek dam parahit ghore
 Chhama kripa samata raju joare 
 'the chariot that wins, has two wheels - valor and patience
 rath par lahraane vaali dhvija or pataakaaen hai- satya- or sheel (sadachaar)
 Force, prudence, power (subordination of the senses) and philanthropy - these are the four horses of that chariot
 ye ghode kshamaa, dayaa or samta rupi rasseen se rath main jode hue hai
 'eis bhajanu charathi sujana
 birti charm santosh kripana
 
 daan parasu budhi sakti prachanda
 The handle is hard
 
 'bhajan of God is the charioteer driving that chariot
 vairaygy dhaal he or santosh talwaar he
 Donation is farce, wisdom is great power, excellent science is hard bow
 ’amal achal man tron samaanaa
 Sama Jam Niyam Silimukh Nana
 
 Kavach Abhade Bipra Guru Puja
 ehi sam bijay upaay na duja
 
 ‘nirmal or sthir man tarkas ke samaan he
 Sham (subdue the mind), Yama and Niyam etc
 are many arrows
 brahmanon or guru kaa pujan abhed kavach he
 There is no other way to win
 ’sakha dharmamay as rath jaaken
 Where does Jeetan repose? 
 'friend, who has such a religious chariot, there is no place to win for him
 ’raamji ne kaha ki he vibhishana, jiske paas aisa majboot rath ho, vah durjaya shatru ko bhi aasaani se jeet saktaa he
 After hearing this, the suspicion of Vibhishan was dispelled
 aage kii kahani sabon ko maaloom hi he
