 Video: ucch shiksha kaa bajet lagaataar kyon ghat rahaa he?video: ucch shiksha kaa bajet lagaataar kyon ghat rahaa he? In the Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the country for about 82 minutes
 piem modi kaa yah bhaashan kaaphi sadha hua najar aayaa, jisamen aalochana se zyada sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa bakhaan tha
 In PM Modi's statement, many such words or issues were not heard, which were not only expected but also became the subject of controversy and discussion
 mob linchingamaujuuda vakt main yah shabd sabase vivaadit or charchit rahaa he, jise aadhaar banaakar vipakshi dal lagaataar modi sarkaar kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 Even PM Modi, in a recent interview, had denied such incidents, but today when he addressed the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the word could not be seen anywhere
 gaay va gangabhartiya janata party ke tamaam netaa goraksha kaa mudda uthaate rahe hai
 Even when PM Modi visited Rwanda country recently, he gifted 200 cows to the villagers there

 PM Modi has also criticized those who took the law in the name of cow protection from the public stage, but in today's speech PM Modi did not try to touch any such aspect
 vahiin, 2014 main satta parivartan ke baad modi sarkaar ne shuruaati dinon main hi rashtriya ganga swatchta mishan program kaa aarambh kar diya tha

 But nothing was heard in his speech on the suicide of farmers in the country

 The word 'minority' was not heard in PM Modi's speech with the minority minority, with the development slogan of all, and with the 125 crore countrymen
 unhone samaaj ke is tabake ke sambandh main mahaj teen talaak se judi muslim mahilaon kaa zikr kiya
 However, on this issue he raised the fear of Muslim women's rights in a very loud manner
 enarasiasam kaa rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) sabase taaja mudda he, jise lekar jamkar siyasat ho rahi he
 NRC has a future of 40 people, currently living in Assam, but no evidence of their being Indian has been found

 He has told the commission that this will reduce electoral spending and will strengthen the federal form
 haalanki, chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki maujuuda halaat main desh main ekasaath chunaav karana sambhav nahin he
 Now that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are close and the possibilities of simultaneous elections were being discussed, but PM Modi's speech did not include anything related to the elections or simultaneous elections

 The government may have different parties in India from the Center to the states, but the economic policies are more or less the same
 sabakaa model ek hi he lekin ab har rajya main ek hi prakaar kii kar pranali hogi jiskaa naam jiesti he
 Goods and Services Tax
 yah badlaav aam upabhokta ko prabhavit karne ke saath-saath badi companiyon se lekar gaanv kasbon main chal rahe chote kaarkaane or utpaadon ko bhi prabhavit karegaa
 More than that, it will also change the existing structure of tax collection in the center and the state
 jitani uljhan aam dukandaar ko aegi, utani hi pareshaani bade-bade kar adhikariyon ko bhi aa sakati he
 The slogan of One India One Tax has been given
 van tex lag rahaa he yaa tex lagane kii koi ek samaan pranali laai ja rahi he
 There is a difference between the two
 kyonki jiesti ke tahat bhi centre ke kar alag hai
 State taxes are different and taxes for alcohol, tobacco and petroleum are different
 jiesti ek chhatari he jiske neeche kai kamaniyaan hai yaa jiesti bina kisi kamaani kii chhatari he
 It is a technical matter but common people will also have to face it
 samajhane main or baratane main bhi
 The 122nd Amendment Bill of the Constitution has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 yah bill loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he
 The Finance Minister said that it is not a surrender of sovereignty of the states but the Center and the states are moving together towards a better and modern tax system
 jisase zyaada rajasav paidaa hoga or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko gati milegi
 GST will make the movement of products in India easier than ever
 kar chori band ho jaaegi
 There will be a round of taxation on Inspector Raj and tax
 isse centre or rajya donon ko laabh hoga
 After passing the Rajya Sabha, the President will send it to the Legislative Assembly of all states
 jinamein se 15 vidhansabhaon ko manzuri deni hogi
 After that the work of forming GST Council will begin
 jiesti council ke liye naukarshahi kaa nayaa dhaancha centre or rajya main banegaa
 For example, there will be posts like Principal Chief Commissioner of Central GST at the center, then the state will be the State GST Commissioner
 iske liye adhikariyon kaa prashikshan shuru bhi ho chukaa he
 The central government has to enact two GST laws
 central jiesti or inter state ji asti
 State governments will have to get the state GST law passed by themselves
 lekin usase pehle in teenon kanoonon ke draft par jiesti council main charchaa hogi
 In GST Council, any issue can be passed with three fourths of votes
 do tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar rajyon ko diya gaya he
 One-third of the voting rights will remain with the center
 bina donon kii vyapak sahmati ke jiesti council main koi prastaav paas nahin ho sakegaa
 The Center will have a veto on the states and the states on the center
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki in teenon kanoonon ke banane ke baad or ise lagu karne ke liye information technalji kaa dhaancha khadaa hote hi jiesti lagu kar di jaegiri
 He did not give any date but said that it will not be too late
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki nai kar pranali ke vajood main aane main ho saktaa he
 It takes one to three years
 kyonki abhi wo samaan dar kya hogi iskaa faisla jiesti council main hona he
 Regarding the same tax rate, it does not seem that the matter will be decided in one or two meetings
 ek tarah se rajyon kaa bajet kya ab jiesti council main banane lagegaa
 non-bjp and non-congress parties have raised questions about the right of states
 bijedy saansad e you singh dev ne kaha ki centre ke paas vito power kyon hona chahie
 
 
 
 rajyon ko zyada vito power hona chahie
 bsp's Satish Mishra said that the GST Council should have the post of Vice Chairman, which is different from the party running the government at the center and the opposition party so as to keep the balance
 ensipi ke prafull patel ne kaha ki brihan mumbai munisapal corporation kaa rajasav kai rajyon se zyada he
 If money is not received on time, then the work of cities like Mumbai will stop
 shivasena ne bhi kaha ki jiesti ke zariye mumbai ko kamazor karne kii koshish ho rahi he, mumbai ne kabhi centre se paisa nahin maanga lekin ab mumbai kaa kya hoga
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien called the GST a chameleon settlement tax

 It should be implemented immediately
 arthshaastri narendra jadhav ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se jidipi 1
 Will increase from 5 percent to two percent
 sarkaron ke liye tex vasuuli kaa dayera bad jayega or kaala dhan ghatega
 But Narendra Jadhav also said that only the GST will not remove all the evils of the economy
 jahaan bhi jiesti thik se lagu nahin hua he vahaan iskaa phayda nahin hua he
 Narendra Jadhav said that if the GST rate is high, poor people will be killed
 sarvice sector main tex dar adhik hui to arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahonchega
 Health, education and clothing can be quite expensive for a short time
 congress party kii taraf se bolte hue pi chidambaram ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki sarkaar bill main hi 18 fisadi ke standard tex rate ko jod de
 14 worldwide tax rate
 1 se lekar 16
 8 percent
 bharat main bhi adhiktam dar tay ho jaani chahie
 There will be no benefit if the tax of 24 to 26 percent is continued even after the introduction of GST
 chidambaram ne kaha ki jidipi kaa 57 fisadi sarvice sector se aata he
 If Service Tax 14
 5 se badhkar 24 pratishat hua to mahangaai bad jaaegi
 Therefore, 70 percent of goods and services should not be taxed more than 18 percent
 sipiem saansad seetaram yechuri ne jiesti ko lekar rajyon ke adhikaar main katautee ko rekhaankit kiya
 He said that the state should have the right to decide the tax
 yechuri ne cells tex par samvidhan sabha main doctor ambedkar ke kathan kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'it seems to me that if we allow the provinces to impose sales tax, then the province should have the freedom to change the rates of sales tax according to their conditions
 isliye agar centre kii taraf se ceiling lagaai gai to cells tex ko lekar bahut dikkatein aaengi
 It is better that the provinces have the right to fix sales tax because the center has enough resources
 yechuri kaa kahana he ki ab rajyon ke paas cells tex kaa adhikaar nahin rahegaa
 How will the state increase its resources
 yechuri ne kaha ki jiesti apratyaksh kar he
 Due to this the poor are burdened
 jaise is bajet main vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat main 37
 7 percent tax comes from direct tax
 jise aap inakam tex ke rup main jaanate hai

 yechuri tark kar rahe the ki ek samay sadan main hi jiesti kaa rate 27 fisadi bataaya gaya tha
 If this happens, the economy will collapse

 i did not listen to all the speeches, but the names of all the speakers who heard about the GST experience in the world were mentioned in their talks
 ek naagarik ke taur par ham un deshon ke anubhavon ko jaanane se vanchit rahe
 We do not know whether the GDP of all the 140 countries where GST came into force
 bharat main jiesti ke baad dedh se do fisadi kii oochaal ke daawey kaa aadhaar kya he
 Did tax evasion in those countries reduce black money
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bhartiya kar pranali main buniyadi sudhaar kii zarurat he
 Will the octroi cease from now on? trakon ko koi nahin rokegaa
 There will be no tax evasion

 What benefits will be given to those small factories, which will be to the big factories

 There will be new experiences and improvements will be made
 itnaa bada badlaav ek baar main sarvagun sampann to nahin ho saktaa lekin jo gun he or jo dosha he us par ham baat to kar sakate hai

 In which he claims that GST will give a huge jump in e-commerce
 unka kahana he ki jiesti se kar pranali pehle se behatar hogi jiskaa laabh har sector ko milegaa
 If you want to read strict criticism, you can read Devendra Sharma's article published on 19 December 2015 daily on Catch News
 samvidhan kaa 122waan sanshodhan bill rajyasabha main pesh kar diya gaya he
 This bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki yah rajyon kii samprabhutaa kaa aatmasamarpan nahin he balki centre or rajya milakar pehle se behatar or aadhunik kar pranali kii disha main bad rahe hai
 Which will generate more revenue and give a boost to the Indian economy
 jiesti ke kaaran bharat main utpaadon kii awajahi pehle se kahin zyaada aasaan ho jaaegi
 Tax evasion will stop

 This will benefit both the Center and the state
 rajyasabha se paas hone ke baad raashtrapati ise sabhi rajyon kii vidhansabha ke paas bhejenge
 Out of which 15 legislatures have to be approved
 uske baad jiesti council banane kaa kaam shuru hoga
 a new bureaucratic structure for the GST Council will be created at the Center and the state
 masalan centre main principal chif kamishnar of central jiesti jaise pad honge to rajyon main state jiesti kamishnar hoga
 For this, training of officers has also started
 centre sarkaar ko do jiesti kanoon banane hai
 Central GST and Inter State g ST
 rajya sarkaron ko apane apane yahaan state jiesti kanoon paas karwaanaa hoga
 But before that the draft of these three laws will be discussed in the GST Council
 jiesti council main kisi mudde ko teen chauthai maton se hi paas karaayaa ja sakegaa
 Two-thirds of the voting rights have been given to the states
 ek tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar centre ke paas rahegaa
 Without the broad consent of both, no proposal will be passed in the GST Council
 centre kaa rajyon par vito hoga or rajyon kaa centre par
 The Finance Minister has said that GST will be implemented as soon as the information technology is set up after these three laws are enacted and implemented
 unhone koi taarikh to nahin bataai magar kaha ki bahut der nahin hogi
 Many people say that there may be a new tax system coming into existence
 ek se teen saal kaa vakt lag jaae
 Because what will be the same rate now, the decision has to be made in the GST Council
 samaan tex rate ko lekar lagata nahin ki ek do baithkon main maamla tay ho jayega
 In a way, will the budget of states now be made in the GST Council
 gaiyr bhaajapa or gaiyr congress dalon ne rajyon ke adhikaar ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 BJD MP AU Singh Dev said why the Center should have veto power
 
 
 
 States should have more veto power
 basapa ke satish mishra ne kaha ki jiesti council main vaais chairman kaa pad hona chahie jo centre main sarkaar chalaa rahi party or vipakshi party se alag ho taaki santulan bana rahe

 Economist Narendra Jadhav said that GDP 1 from the implementation of GST
 5 pratishat se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 For governments, the scope of tax collection will increase and black money will decrease
 par narendra jadhav ne yah bhi kaha ki sirf jiesti se arthvyavastha kii sari buraaiyaan dur nahin ho jaaengi
 Wherever GST is not implemented properly there is no benefit
 narendra jadhav ne kaha ki agar jiesti rate adhik hua to garib logon par maar padegi
 If the tax rate is higher in the service sector, the economy will be harmed
 thode samay ke liye swasthya, shiksha or kapadaa kaaphi mahangaa ho saktaa he
 Speaking on behalf of the Congress party, P
 Chidambaram has appealed to the government to add a standard tax rate of 18 percent to the bill itself
 duniya bhar main tex rate 14
 1 to 16
 8 pratishat he
 The maximum rate should also be fixed in India
 agar jiesti aane ke baad bhi 24 se 26 pratishat kaa tex lagata rahe to koi laabh nahin hoga
 Chidambaram said that 57 per cent of GDP comes from the service sector
 agar sarvice tex 14
 If it increases from 5 to 24 percent then inflation will increase
 isliye 70 fisadi vastu or sevaaon par 18 fisadi se adhik tex nahin laganaa chahie
 CPM MP Sitaram Yechury underlined the cuts in states' authority over GST
 unhone kaha ki tex tay karne kaa adhikaar rajya kaa hona chahie
 Yechury referred to Dr
 Ambedkar's statement in the Constituent Assembly on sales tax
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he ki agar ham praanton ko cells tex lagane dete hai tab praant ko azaadi honi chahie ki ve apni sthitiyon ke anusaar cells tex kii daron main badlaav kar saken
 Therefore, if the ceiling is imposed by the Center, then there will be a lot of problems regarding sales tax
 behatar he cells tex tay karne kaa adhikaar praanton ke paas rahe kyonki centre ke paas paryaapt sansaadhan hote hai
 Yechury says that states will no longer have the right to sales tax
 rajya apana sansaadhan kaise badhayega
 Yechury said that GST is an indirect tax
 iske kaaran garibon par boj padataa he
 Like the Finance Minister said that 37 in India
 7 pratishat kar pratyaksh kar se aata he
 What you know as income tax
 62
 3 percent comes from indirect tax, sales tax, VAT tax, etc
 indonesia jaise desh main pratyaksh kar kaa hissaa 55
 8 percent, 57 in South Africa
 5 pratishat he
 Yechury was arguing that at one time the GST rate in the House itself was stated to be 27 percent
 agar aisa hua to arthvyavastha charmara jaaegi
 So all these arguments were given
 ashanka or sambhaavna ko lekar baaten hui
 Changes in the tax system are now fixed
 kya hoga ham nahin jaanate hai
 GST was introduced in France only in 1954
 france kii jidipi 1
 16 percent

 GDP of China 6
 81 pratishat he, japan kii jidipi 0
 Germany's GDP is 59 percent
 51 pratishat he, britain kii jidipi 2
 52 percent, comments america main jiesti nahin he
 GDP there 2
 57 pratishat he
 There is no GST in India at this time
 bharat kii jidipi 7
 26 percent
 saare bhaashan to nahin sune lekin jitne bhi vaktaaon ko suna unki baton main duniya bhar main jiesti ke kya anubhav rahe hai iskaa naam maatr kaa hi zikr rahaa
 As a citizen, we were deprived of knowing the experiences of those countries
 hamen nahin maaloom ki jin 140 deshon main jiesti lagu hui kya sabhi kii jidipi main oochaal aayaa
 What is the basis of the claim of a one and a half to two per cent jump after GST in India

 Such a big change cannot be accomplished all at once, but we can talk about the virtues and the faults

 If you want to read about its possibilities, then you can read the article of Sachin Bansal of Flipkart which was featured in Economic Times on 25 July
 jisamen wo daawa karte hai ki jiesti se i-kamrs main bhayankar oochaal aayega
 He says that the tax system will be better than GST, which will benefit every sector
 sakht aalochana padhani ho to aap 19 disambar 2015 ke rose kaich news par chape devendra sharma kaa lekh pard sakate hai
 After passing the Rajya Sabha, the President will send it to the Legislative Assembly of all states
 jinamein se 15 vidhansabhaon ko manzuri deni hogi
 After that the work of forming GST Council will begin
 jiesti council ke liye naukarshahi kaa nayaa dhaancha centre or rajya main banegaa
 For example, there will be posts like Principal Chief Commissioner of Central GST at the center, then the state will be the State GST Commissioner
 iske liye adhikariyon kaa prashikshan shuru bhi ho chukaa he
 The central government has to enact two GST laws
 central jiesti or inter state ji asti
 State governments will have to get the state GST law passed by themselves
 lekin usase pehle in teenon kanoonon ke draft par jiesti council main charchaa hogi
 In GST Council, any issue can be passed with three fourths of votes
 do tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar rajyon ko diya gaya he
 One-third of the voting rights will remain with the center
 bina donon kii vyapak sahmati ke jiesti council main koi prastaav paas nahin ho sakegaa
 The Center will have a veto on the states and the states on the center
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki in teenon kanoonon ke banane ke baad or ise lagu karne ke liye information technalji kaa dhaancha khadaa hote hi jiesti lagu kar di jaegiri
 He did not give any date but said that it will not be too late
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki nai kar pranali ke vajood main aane main ho saktaa he
 It takes one to three years
 kyonki abhi wo samaan dar kya hogi iskaa faisla jiesti council main hona he
 Regarding the same tax rate, it does not seem that the matter will be decided in one or two meetings
 ek tarah se rajyon kaa bajet kya ab jiesti council main banane lagegaa
 non-bjp and non-congress parties have raised questions about the right of states
 bijedy saansad e you singh dev ne kaha ki centre ke paas vito power kyon hona chahie
 
 
 
 rajyon ko zyada vito power hona chahie
 bsp's Satish Mishra said that the GST Council should have the post of Vice Chairman, which is different from the party running the government at the center and the opposition party so as to keep the balance
 ensipi ke prafull patel ne kaha ki brihan mumbai munisapal corporation kaa rajasav kai rajyon se zyada he
 If money is not received on time, then the work of cities like Mumbai will stop
 shivasena ne bhi kaha ki jiesti ke zariye mumbai ko kamazor karne kii koshish ho rahi he, mumbai ne kabhi centre se paisa nahin maanga lekin ab mumbai kaa kya hoga
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien called the GST a chameleon settlement tax
 unki party jiesti kii samarthak rahi he lekin derek o bryan kaa kahana tha ki ise lekar congress or bijepi ne bacchon si raajnneeti kii he
 It should be implemented immediately
 arthshaastri narendra jadhav ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se jidipi 1
 Will increase from 5 percent to two percent
 sarkaron ke liye tex vasuuli kaa dayera bad jayega or kaala dhan ghatega
 But Narendra Jadhav also said that only the GST will not remove all the evils of the economy
 jahaan bhi jiesti thik se lagu nahin hua he vahaan iskaa phayda nahin hua he
 Narendra Jadhav said that if the GST rate is high, poor people will be killed
 sarvice sector main tex dar adhik hui to arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahonchega
 Health, education and clothing can be quite expensive for a short time
 congress party kii taraf se bolte hue pi chidambaram ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki sarkaar bill main hi 18 fisadi ke standard tex rate ko jod de
 14 worldwide tax rate
 1 se lekar 16
 8 percent
 bharat main bhi adhiktam dar tay ho jaani chahie
 There will be no benefit if the tax of 24 to 26 percent is continued even after the introduction of GST
 chidambaram ne kaha ki jidipi kaa 57 fisadi sarvice sector se aata he
 If Service Tax 14
 5 se badhkar 24 pratishat hua to mahangaai bad jaaegi
 Therefore, 70 percent of goods and services should not be taxed more than 18 percent
 sipiem saansad seetaram yechuri ne jiesti ko lekar rajyon ke adhikaar main katautee ko rekhaankit kiya
 He said that the state should have the right to decide the tax
 yechuri ne cells tex par samvidhan sabha main doctor ambedkar ke kathan kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'it seems to me that if we allow the provinces to impose sales tax, then the province should have the freedom to change the rates of sales tax according to their conditions
 isliye agar centre kii taraf se ceiling lagaai gai to cells tex ko lekar bahut dikkatein aaengi
 It is better that the provinces have the right to fix sales tax because the center has enough resources
 yechuri kaa kahana he ki ab rajyon ke paas cells tex kaa adhikaar nahin rahegaa
 How will the state increase its resources
 yechuri ne kaha ki jiesti apratyaksh kar he
 Due to this the poor are burdened
 jaise is bajet main vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat main 37
 7 percent tax comes from direct tax
 jise aap inakam tex ke rup main jaanate hai
 62
 3 pratishat apratyaksh kar se aata he, cells tex waite tex vagairah
 Direct tax share in a country like Indonesia 55
 8 pratishat he, dakshin africa main 57
 5 percent
 yechuri tark kar rahe the ki ek samay sadan main hi jiesti kaa rate 27 fisadi bataaya gaya tha
 If this happens, the economy will collapse
 to yah sab daleelein di gayi
 There were talks about apprehension and possibility
 kar pranali main badlaav ab tay he
 We don't know what will happen
 france main 1954 main hi jiesti lagu hui thi
 GDP of France 1
 16 pratishat he
 140 countries have GST
 china kii jidipi 6
 Japan's GDP is 81 percent
 59 pratishat he, germany kii jidipi 1
 UK GDP is 51 percent
 52 pratishat he,tippaniyan America does not have GST
 vahaan kii jidipi 2
 57 percent
 bharat main is vakt jiesti nahin he
 India's GDP7

 i did not listen to all the speeches, but the names of all the speakers who heard about the GST experience in the world were mentioned in their talks
 ek naagarik ke taur par ham un deshon ke anubhavon ko jaanane se vanchit rahe
 We do not know whether the GDP of all the 140 countries where GST came into force
 bharat main jiesti ke baad dedh se do fisadi kii oochaal ke daawey kaa aadhaar kya he
 Did tax evasion in those countries reduce black money
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bhartiya kar pranali main buniyadi sudhaar kii zarurat he
 Will the octroi cease from now on? trakon ko koi nahin rokegaa
 There will be no tax evasion
 laghu va madhyam udyog main karodon log kaam karte hai
 What benefits will be given to those small factories, which will be to the big factories
 nai pranali he
 There will be new experiences and improvements will be made
 itnaa bada badlaav ek baar main sarvagun sampann to nahin ho saktaa lekin jo gun he or jo dosha he us par ham baat to kar sakate hai
 So that we all have better understanding on this issue
 agar isaki sambhaavnaaon ke bare main padhanaa he to aap flipcart ke sachin bansal kaa lekh pard sakate hai jo 25 july ke din iconomik times main chapa tha
 In which he claims that GST will give a huge jump in e-commerce
 unka kahana he ki jiesti se kar pranali pehle se behatar hogi jiskaa laabh har sector ko milegaa
 If you want to read strict criticism, you can read Devendra Sharma's article published on 19 December 2015 daily on Catch News
 jiesti council main kisi mudde ko teen chauthai maton se hi paas karaayaa ja sakegaa
 Two-thirds of the voting rights have been given to the states
 ek tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar centre ke paas rahegaa
 Without the broad consent of both, no proposal will be passed in the GST Council
 centre kaa rajyon par vito hoga or rajyon kaa centre par
 The Finance Minister has said that GST will be implemented as soon as the information technology is set up after these three laws are enacted and implemented
 unhone koi taarikh to nahin bataai magar kaha ki bahut der nahin hogi
 Many people say that there may be a new tax system coming into existence
 ek se teen saal kaa vakt lag jaae
 Because what will be the same rate now, the decision has to be made in the GST Council
 samaan tex rate ko lekar lagata nahin ki ek do baithkon main maamla tay ho jayega
 In a way, will the budget of states now be made in the GST Council
 gaiyr bhaajapa or gaiyr congress dalon ne rajyon ke adhikaar ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 BJD MP AU Singh Dev said why the Center should have veto power
 
 
 
 States should have more veto power
 basapa ke satish mishra ne kaha ki jiesti council main vaais chairman kaa pad hona chahie jo centre main sarkaar chalaa rahi party or vipakshi party se alag ho taaki santulan bana rahe
 Praful Patel of NCP said that Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation has more revenue than many states
 agar samay par paisa nahin mila to mumbai jaise shaharon kaa kaam ruk jayega
 Shiv Sena also said that efforts are being made to weaken Mumbai through GST, Mumbai never asked for money from the Center but now what will happen to Mumbai
 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne jiesti ko girggit samjhauta tex kaha he
 His party has been a supporter of GST, but Derek o'brien said that the Congress and BJP have done politics for children
 ise turant lagu karnaa chahie
 Economist Narendra Jadhav said that GDP 1 from the implementation of GST
 5 pratishat se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 For governments, the scope of tax collection will increase and black money will decrease
 par narendra jadhav ne yah bhi kaha ki sirf jiesti se arthvyavastha kii sari buraaiyaan dur nahin ho jaaengi
 Wherever GST is not implemented properly there is no benefit
 narendra jadhav ne kaha ki agar jiesti rate adhik hua to garib logon par maar padegi
 If the tax rate is higher in the service sector, the economy will be harmed
 thode samay ke liye swasthya, shiksha or kapadaa kaaphi mahangaa ho saktaa he
 Speaking on behalf of the Congress party, P
 Chidambaram has appealed to the government to add a standard tax rate of 18 percent to the bill itself
 duniya bhar main tex rate 14
 1 to 16
 8 pratishat he
 The maximum rate should also be fixed in India
 agar jiesti aane ke baad bhi 24 se 26 pratishat kaa tex lagata rahe to koi laabh nahin hoga
 Chidambaram said that 57 per cent of GDP comes from the service sector
 agar sarvice tex 14
 If it increases from 5 to 24 percent then inflation will increase
 isliye 70 fisadi vastu or sevaaon par 18 fisadi se adhik tex nahin laganaa chahie
 CPM MP Sitaram Yechury underlined the cuts in states' authority over GST
 unhone kaha ki tex tay karne kaa adhikaar rajya kaa hona chahie
 Yechury referred to Dr
 Ambedkar's statement in the Constituent Assembly on sales tax
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he ki agar ham praanton ko cells tex lagane dete hai tab praant ko azaadi honi chahie ki ve apni sthitiyon ke anusaar cells tex kii daron main badlaav kar saken
 Therefore, if the ceiling is imposed by the Center, then there will be a lot of problems regarding sales tax
 behatar he cells tex tay karne kaa adhikaar praanton ke paas rahe kyonki centre ke paas paryaapt sansaadhan hote hai
 Yechury says that states will no longer have the right to sales tax
 rajya apana sansaadhan kaise badhayega
 Yechury said that GST is an indirect tax
 iske kaaran garibon par boj padataa he
 Like the Finance Minister said that 37 in India
 7 pratishat kar pratyaksh kar se aata he
 What you know as income tax
 62
 3 percent comes from indirect tax, sales tax, VAT tax, etc
 indonesia jaise desh main pratyaksh kar kaa hissaa 55
 8 percent, 57 in South Africa
 5 pratishat he
 Yechury was arguing that at one time the GST rate in the House itself was stated to be 27 percent
 agar aisa hua to arthvyavastha charmara jaaegi
 So all these arguments were given
 ashanka or sambhaavna ko lekar baaten hui
 Changes in the tax system are now fixed

 As a citizen, we were deprived of knowing the experiences of those countries
 hamen nahin maaloom ki jin 140 deshon main jiesti lagu hui kya sabhi kii jidipi main oochaal aayaa
 What is the basis of the claim of a one and a half to two per cent jump after GST in India
 kya un deshon main kar chori kam ho gai, kaala dhan kam ho gaya
 There is no doubt that the Indian tax system needs basic reforms

 ) ab internet ke baad sabase bada bulbula kryptokarency bitcoin sabit ho rahaa he
 1 at the moment
 67 karod bitcoin vajood main hai, jinka mulya in panktiyon ke likhe jate vakt kii keemat ke hisaab se 267 arab dollar se zyada he (ek kii keemat 16,000 dollar ke hisaab se)
 To understand its size, see that on December 1, the total value of rupees in circulation was around 252 billion (rs 65)
 kaa 1 dollar ke hisaab se) tha
 In January 2017, bitcoin was being traded at less than $ 1,000 and reached $ 16,000 in the first fortnight of December
 keemat main 2,000 fisadi ke is ijaphe se iske kaarobaar main baari vrudghi hui
 Now many Indians have joined it and many stock markets are also allowing bitcoin to be traded in rupees
 bitcoin kii keemat main jabardast utaar-chadhaav aate rahete hai: ek hi satr main 20 fisadi kaa badlaav aam baat he
 In comparison, the price of gold changed by almost 8 percent throughout the year
 yahi utaar-chadhaav ise behad jokhim bharaa bana detaa he
 Today you can buy a car in one bitcoin, maybe next week, buy two cars or just a two wheeler
 isliye agar aap bitcoin main lenden kar rahe hai, to apni puri rakam ko isamen daanv par laga dena nasamajhi hogi
 So play a little bit
 nausikhuon ke liye bitcoin unic computer code kii ladi he
 New bitcoins are created (extracted) by solving math questions
 harek coin yani sikke ko 10 karod unic hisson main baanta ja saktaa he jinhen 'satoshi' kehete hai
 It is named after its famous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto
 bitcoin chatur kryptography se banaae jate hai
 It uses an open, distributed, electronic account, called a 'blockchain' which consists of 'blocks' of time stamped transactions
 iske banaae jane ke baad bitcoin main hua harek lenden blockchen main lagaataar darj hota rahata he
 Anyone can download a copy of the blockchain and view the transaction history of the coin
 bitcoin ko digital wolet main rakhaa jaataa he
 Each wallet has a public ID number or public key
 harek wolet kii ek nijee chaabi bhi he jo keval uske maalik ko pataa hoti he
 If this key is lost then the coins kept in it will disappear and there is no way to get them back
 lenden us saarvajanik khaataa sankhya ke saath is nijee chaabi kaa istemaal karke kiye jate hai taaki 'nishchit coin' ko duusare wolet main daalaa ja sake
 Each transaction produces a special 'hash' (encrypted) message or message that cannot be tampered with
 saarvajanik chaabi lagaakar koi bhi is massej kii tasdik kar saktaa he
 When the transaction message is sent, the user can easily check whether (i) they are indeed a certain coin in the wallet and (ii) no fraud is being done by doing two transactions with the same coin
 jab zyaadaatar yujar lenden kii pramanikta kii tasdik kar dete hai tab ek nae 'block' main us lenden ko jodakar blockchen ko apadet kar diya jaataa he
 It takes 10 minutes to verify a transaction
 kryptokarency exange kai mudraon main bitcoin ke lenden ko mumkin banaate hai
 These exchanges will match the wallet to people or institutions and demand KYC
 lekin exange se baahar lenden aasaan hai
 Create a new wallet, place coins in it and swap private keys for cash
 gumnaam rahete hue kai sari mudraon main bitcoin kaa lenden karnaa seemaa-paar rakam bhejne kaa aasaan tarika he
 Only Japan, Australia and some other countries recognize it as currency
 zyaadaatar duusare desh abhi ise paribhaashit nahin kar paae hai
 If more businessmen like Alibaba and Amazon accept this, then their utility will increase
 nesdak or chicago board of trade bitcoin par vaayada karaaron kii peshkash kar rahe hai
 It is attractive capital for transactions, but it is also risk-averse
 philhal hamaare saamne ek bulbula he or agar lenden main ijapha hota he to yah bulbula or bada ho saktaa he
 But the problem with bubbles is that they burst
 khel or yuva maamalon ke rajyamantri rajyavardhan singh rathod ne desh main khel pratibhaaon par bharpoor bharosa jataate hue kaha ki desh main khelon kaa jabardast maahaul he
 He claimed that not one but 100 Usain Bolts could be produced in India
 rathod ne 2004 main athens olympic main rajat padak jeeta tha
 Dreaming big is important
 lekin aisa desh jahaan olympic padakon kii koi khaas parampara nahin he, vahaan aisa daawa karnaa badbolapan hi kaha jayega ki usan bolt jaise 100 champion khoje ja sakate hai
 Such claims appear to cross the fine line between optimism and complacency
 yahaan tak ki padak jeetne waalon kii taksaal kaha jane vaala china bhi olympic ke aakhri daur ke tej dhavakon ke liye abhi sangharsh kar rahaa he
 Then, in such a situation, India's claim to produce 100 Usain Bolts will be airborne
 jamaica ke usan bolt duniya ke sabase tej dhaavak hai
 There are many records in his name

 On 30 March this year, seven personnel of 230 battalion of CRPF were killed
 unka trek maovadiyon kii bichaai barudi surang ke visphot main funs gaya tha
 In this explosion, some soldiers were killed on the spot, while the rest became vulnerable in the open, the Maoists gunned them with bullets
 siarpief ke jawan maovadiyon ke sabase ghaatak impruwizd explosive divises (iidi) yaa barudi surangon ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 The Maoists have buried the ieds under the ground, hung them on trees, or even pasted posters-slips to target the jawans and their armored vehicles
 in visphotakon ko chaahe jaise istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, isiilie ye vinaash ke sabase aasaan or ghaatak hathiyaar ban gaye hai
 Since 2010, around 100 soldiers of the CRPF, a paramilitary force fighting the Maoists in the country, have been martyred and 247 injured
 isi dauraan is bal ne kareeb 57 ton visphotak bhi baraamad kiya
 Last year itself, a record number of 1,702 ieds and 20,781 detonators were seized
 ghaatak iidi se bachaav kaa ekmaatr suraksha kavach vishesh bakhtarband gaadiyaan yaa barudi surangon se surakshit vaahan (empivi) hai
 But due to their severe shortage, CRPF has become helpless
 siarpief ko 352 empivi (ek kii keemat kareeb 1 karod ru
 ) Has the right to hold a fleet
 uske paas aise sirf 120 vaahan hai
 Worse is that there is no workshop in the central and eastern part of the country to repair and maintain them, so that 60 percent of the available vehicles are worth using
 empivi ke abhaav main siarpief ko gasht ke liye gaiyr-bakhtarband nijee trek istemaal karne padate hai

 However, the Ministry of Home Affairs and CRPF have not responded to questions sent to India Today

 The current armored vehicles (mpvs) mostly replicate the Ordinance Factory Board of the 1980s 'caspir' mpvs from South Africa, which were purchased by the Army for use in Jammu and Kashmir in the late 1980s
 ordinance factory board ke banaae maujuuda empivi chakke ke neeche 10 kilo or body ke neeche 14 kilo tianti ke visphot ko jhel sakate hai
 It seems that the Maoists came to know about this only in 2005 (as seized literature shows)
 tab se maovadi empivi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye 50 kilo or kai baar 80 kilo tak tianti kaa istemaal visphot ke liye karte hai
 In many cases, jawans are killed by explosion within the vehicle

 aam aadmi party main badi sanjidagi setu-tu main-main chal rahi he
 In the party, there is a conflict of views against the opposition Ashutoshado, while Yogendra Yadav advises not to shorten yourself with small antics
 ye sab twitor or fasebuk ke jariye ho rahaa he
 Questions and cleanliness are sending letters one by one to Arvind Kejriwal
 in chitthiyon main aam aadmi party ke kaamkaaj ko lekar dheron sawaal hai
 At the center of the questions are two of the founders of AAP - Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan
 itnaa hi nahin, aap ke aatanrik lokapal admiral ramdaas ne mukhyamantri ban jane ke baad bhi kejariwal ke party sanyojak bane rahane par sawaal uthaaya he
 This is the biggest post of the party
 in sawaalon ke bich aap netaa sanjay singh apane twit main poochhate hai, 'jo log arvind kejariwal ko sanyojak pad se hataanaa chaahate hai kya unhen desh ke kaaryakartaaon kii bhaavana kaa khyaal he?'sawaalon kaa uthanaa or unhen suna janaa achche loktantr kii nishaani he
 There is a campaign to remove Yogendra Yadav from the party's political affairs committee
 prashanth bhushan ne istife kii dhamkee di he, kyonki party main swaraj nahin he or party vyakti kendrit hoti ja rahi he
 The intention here is to have Kejriwal concentrated
 haalanki, swaraj kejariwal kaa dream project he
 He has also written a book by the same name
 'aap' main mache ghamaasan ke bich yogendra yadav apane fasebuk pej par likhte hai, "pichley do din se prashanth ji or mere bare main chal rahi khabaren sun rahaa hum, pard rahaa hum
 New new stories are being fabricated, allegations are being made, conspiracies are being discovered
 ye sab pard ke hansi bhi aati he or dukh bhi hota he
 Laughter comes because the stories are so concocted and absurd

 "the siege of Yogendra Yadav is making loud efforts to put Yadav in the dock inside you
 iske tahat yadav par paanch aarope lagaae gaye hai or unke saath saboot bhi pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 Yogendra Yadav has been accused of harassing the aap's Haryana unit, misinformed Kejriwal, threatening to leave the party before the Delhi elections, agreeing to his terms and demoralizing the workers
 fasebuk post ke saath hi yogendra yadav ne naseehat bharaa ek twit bhi kiya he
 Says Yadav, "'this is the time to do big things with a lot of heart, after a big win
 desh ne hamase badi ummiden lagaai hai
 Do not belittle yourself and this hope with small antics
 " chunaav nateezon ke baad arvind kejariwal ne kaaryakartaaon ko ahankaar se bachane kii salaah di thi
 Yadav probably wants to remind them of that
 takaraav kii asli vajahtakaraav kii ek vajah party kii gatividhiyon ko lekar bhi he
 Kejriwal wants the focus to be on Delhi for now
 jabaki doosraa dhada, jisamen yogendra yadav bhi hai, party ko puure desh main vistaar dena chahta he
 Kejriwal argues that the worker is not ready at the grassroots level like Delhi in the rest of the country
 loksabhaa or haryana vidhansabha chunaavon main haar or dilli main betahasha jeet kejariwal ke tark ko saport bhi karte hai
 It is also news that Kejriwal himself has expressed his desire to be free from the responsibility of the convenor so that he can pay full attention to Delhi
 vaise bhi mukhyamantri pad ko chhodkar kejariwal ne saare mantralay dipti siem manish sisodiya ko pehle hi de rakhaa he
 The other side of the picture is also not blurred
 party kaa ek dhada samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad koi vibhaag apane paas isliye nahin rakhaa ki party ko bhi ve apane hisaab se chalaa saken
 Conflict of views or battle of supremacy? Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson Ashutosh has said in his tweet that whatever is going on within the party is nothing personal but a conflict of views
 ashutosh ne twit main kaha, ''yah kashmir main janamat sangrah kii maang karne vaale vamapanthiyon or kalyaan kii vyavhaarik raajnneeti karne waalon ke bich vichaaron kaa takaraav he'' ashutosh ne ise nijee raay bataate hue ummid jataai he ki is tarah ke vichaaron se party kaa bhavishya behatar hoga
 So is it all just a clash of ideas? Or is there a battle for supremacy at its core

 There is something happening in politics on which you, the audience, need to watch over the loyalty of your parties
 ho saktaa he ki is match main koi dal kisi point se aapaki nazar main jeet rahaa ho, lekin kul milakar ham sab haar rahe hai
 If this does not sound right, then sit down in the chair of Congress BJP and sit and watch prime time
 lekin pehle ye tasviir dekhiye jo aaj ke hindustan times main chhapi he
 According to the picture, Congress leaders are comfortable talking to Venkaiah Naidu in solitude
 isse gyaat hota he ki hamaare netaa privet spes yani drawing room tip kii jagahon par ek duusare se hansate hue batiyate bhi hai
 Looking at this picture, it will appear that there is one you and you who start taking the dispute of these two parties seriously
 in tasveeron ko dekhiye or khud se sawaal kiijie ki kya saarvajanik spes main ye netaa aise rishton kaa pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 You know the context of the discussion that when Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda gave a speech at the Prime Minister's function in Kaithal, Haryana, he got hooted
 hooting angreji kaa shabd he aap ise hule lele yaa narebaazi se samaj sakate hai
 The Chief Minister ended his speech midway
 akhabaaron kii report ke anusaar pradhanmantri ne bheed se shant hone kii apil bhi kii
 Later the Chief Minister said that he has been insulted and now he will not go to any program of the Prime Minister
 ab agar aisa kah bhi diya to kya pradhanmantri ko isaki soochna milane par saarvajanik yaa vyaktigat rup se khed nahin jataana chahie tha
 On the other hand, was it so big that Hooda Saheb should have made such a declaration
 congress ko apane sahit vipakshi mukhyamantriyon se pradhanmantri ke kaarykram ke bahishkaar kii apil kerani chahie thi
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also announced and today the Prime Minister did not go when he reached Maharashtra
 lekin aaj ek sakaaratmak baat hui
 In Nagpur, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that he spoke to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 unase kaha ki yah kaarykram centre or maharashtra kaa saajha he
 Must come
 vekainya ne kaha ki unki kami khal rahi he
 The Prime Minister believes in federalism
 maharashtra se pehle pradhanmantri jharkhand gaye
 There, the Chief Minister of the state Hemant Soren also appealed to the people to remain calm and let them complete the speech, but sloganeering started against them and the crowd started chanting Modi
 lekin yahaan par pradhanmantri narebaazi karne waalon ko chup karaate hue tasveeron main darj ho gaye
 This was a good move
 magar iske baad bhi log nahin maane
 The Prime Minister's status in the constitutional system is high
 kya ek bade ke naate unhen mukhyamantriyon ko phone kar is vivaad ko khatm nahin kar dena chahie tha
 The Prime Minister himself has been talking about forming a team of CM and PM for one year
 kya is team ke maujuuda or bhavi mukhiya ke naate unhen hi pahal kar vivaad ko samaapt nahin kar dena chahie tha
 The Congress alleged that it was an insult to the states
 lekin, kya congress pradhanmantri kaa apmaan nahin kar rahi he
 Shouldn't he have thought before going to the extent that he is the Prime Minister of the country
 virodh kaa doosraa tarika bhi ho saktaa he
 After all, where will this fight end
 koi loktantr kii kasame khate hue kisi ke saamne jane yaa baat karne kaa virodh kaise kar saktaa he

 Let us know that Anandiben has already ordered a CID inquiry into the matter
 maamle main ab tak 16 logon kii giraftaar ho chuki he
 Politics in the Parliament: While the anger of the Dalit community has come out on the streets due to the bullying of the guard parties in Una, Gujarat, in the national capital Delhi, the tone of politics has intensified
 congress ne buudhvaar ko rajyasabha yah mudda uthaaya, jiske baad sadan main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is also scheduled to visit Gujarat on Thursday
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne bhi oona jane kaa elaan kiya he
 In this way, the politics of the province has intensified on the issue of atrocities with the youth of the Dalit community

 The anger of the Dalits and this incident of getting on the road reminds them of the Patidar agitation a year ago

 Many youth declared suicide
 gujarat main ek saal ke bheetar hi duusare jaateey andolan kii sugabugahat tej ho gai he
 With this, in front of Anandiben, the responsibility of saving BJP in 2017 has come
 is vajah se vah daliton ko naaraaz kar ghate kaa sauda nahin kar sakati
 The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have also intensified their politics over the Congress in Gujarat for 20 years
 rahul gandhi or kejariwal bhi peedit parivaar se milane ke liye gujarat pahunchane vaale hai
 In fact, for the Congress which has been away from power in Gujarat for 20 years, the next assembly election is like a battle of existence
 congress kii gatividhiyon ke saaf sanketasube main haashie par dikhti congress main patidaar patel andolan kii vajah se thodi jaan aa gai he
 On this issue of atrocities on Dalits, his dreams of coming into action immediately and the announcement of Rahul Gandhi's visit to power are clearly visible
 teesri takat banane kii koshish main 'aap'vahiin gujarat main aam aadmi party ab teesarirajanatik partybanane kaa sapana dekh rahi he

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot managed to not only prevent Salman Rushdie from coming to the Jaipur Literature Conference between 20 to 24 January but also to stop his video conferencing
 18 janvari ko ve nai dilli main kendriya grih mantri pi
 i met Chidambaram
 uske baad kendriya agenciyon se unki harsambhav madad ko kaha gaya taaki lekhak rushdi sidhe yaa virtual prasaaran bhi na kar saken
 Ahead of stopping the live telecast, on 24 January, Muslim Forum leader Pakir Farooqui said to the media, "jaipur Police Commissioner B
 el
 According to Sony, if video conferencing took place, it would be the last literary festival in Jaipur
 aayojakon ko yah baat unhone bataa di he
 "the police never gave any assurance about the safety of the organizers or Rushdie, and there was a great fear of danger
" ''rushdi samaaroh se bade nahin hai
 If something goes wrong, there is a lot of possibility, then we will not be responsible at all
 ''gahalot aakhir kyon rokna chaahate the rushdi ko?gahalot ko congress aalaa kaman kii shah thi ki ve khud ko muslim hiton ke kherkhwaah ke rup main sabit karne main is maukey kaa upyog karen
 The party was finding itself in a desperate situation after 10 Meo Muslims were killed by Rajasthan Police bullets in Gopalgarh (alwar) town, bordering Uttar Pradesh in September
 rajya main aadha darjan se adhik sampradayik ghatnaayen huin jinamein nishane par musalmaan hi rahe
 Pages of Quran Sharif were burnt in Ajmer city
 rajya khufia agency ne gahalot ko bataaya tha ki uttar pradesh se sate ilaakon main aise poster najar aae hai jinamein unako 'gopalgarh kaa ashok modi' bataate hue unki tulana gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke godhra se kii gai he
 He decided that the invitation sent to Rushdie for the conference should be used to correct his tarnished image, even if a handful of Muslims had to point out a violent threat to the thousands of people attending the conference
 gahalot kii ranneetigahalot ne ek anjaan or ansune gut ke gyaapan par sangyaan liya
 The group called itself the Muslim Unity Forum and along with its memorandum, submitted a letter to Darul Uloom of Deoband
 daarul ulum ne centre se rushdi ko is aayojan se dur rakhane kii maang kii lekin usne 2007 main tab ise nazarandaaj kar diya tha jab ve isamen shariq hue the
 bjp's State Minority Cell also sought to keep Rushdie away from the ceremony without getting permission from the party high command
 bhaajapa ke is cell kaa vajood bhi lagbhag vaisaa hi he jaisaa ekta forum kaa he
 Gehlot got these handful of Muslims into action while none of them had anything at stake
 sammelan shuru hone se pehle unhone baar-baar kaha ki is tarah ke jajbaat ko dekhte hue kanoon or vyavastha kii badi samasya khadi ho sakati he
 Mushirul Hasan, associated with the University of Rajasthan, said that there were not more than 50-100 protesters all over Jaipur
 ''kisne uksaaya unhen? hamen pataa karne kii jarurat he?'' gahalot ko ehsaas tha ki isse udaaravaadi pareshaan honge or yatra par pratibandh ke khule samarthan se unki chhavi ko nuksaan pahonchega
 Hence, they chose the path of confusion
 ek taraf unhone daawa kiya ki ve centre ko virdohi logon ke vichaar bataa rahe hai
 At the same time, he also kept saying that he and his government were not a hindrance in this journey
 jhooth pakadaa gayarushdi kii yatra ko lekar unke or unki sarkaar kii sajeesh kaa bhandaphod rushdi ke bayaan se hua
 On January 20, Rushdie said he was forced to cancel his trip when he received intelligence that two mercenary killers had left Mumbai to assassinate him
 khufia beuro ne june, 2011 kii ek soochna nikaal lee or use nayaa banaakar jari kar diya
 It said that a man detained with weapons in Maharashtra suspected that he could target Rushdie
 lekin ek baar soni or maharashtra police ne jab aise kisi khatre yaa anhoni kii ashanka se inkaar kiya to rushdi or media ne is khatre ko jhooth qaraar diya
 After this, Gehlot and his home secretary
 es
 Sandhu was forced to admit on 23 January that he was officially aware of the trip and continued to warn organizers and Rushdie about the danger
 aakhir maan liyarushdi ko dur rakhane kii yojana main shaamil ek bahut hi varisht police adhikari ne india today se kaha, ''haa, ham rushdi ko dur rakhane kaa aadesh lagu karne main safal rahe
 State Congress spokesperson Satyendra Raghav told the party's official stance for the first time on January 24, "we were prepared that the English media would criticize us
" haa, congress kabhi nahin chaahati thi ki rushdi aaen
 The police action was entirely focused on assisting the protesters
 rajya police kaa yah ravaiya is lihaaj se ekadam ulat tha ki usne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko 9 or 17 janvari ko unki jaipur kii do yatraaon ke dauraan puri suraksha di
 The risk of life to Modi is more than that of Rushdie
 yaa phir jab usne america tok sho celibrity opera winfre ke liye 22 janvari ko suraksha vyavastha kii jabaki unako kisi tarah kaa koi aatanki khatra nahin tha
 The doors of that venue were closed less than an hour before their session began
 2,000 pasadhari kaarykram sthal se 200 meter dur roak die gaye
 Despite being inside, people were not allowed inside for two hours
 iske vipareet, police ne aayojakon se kaha ki pratibandhit pustak saetanic varsej ke ansh padhane vaale chaaron lekhak giraftaar yaa hinsa kaa shikaar hone se bachane ke liye jaipur chhod den jabaki in lekhakon ne kanoon nahin todaa tha kyonki pratibandhit kitaab unke paas thi hi nahin
 Police asked the organizers to record the protesters as visitors
 unamem se kuch ne to utsav sthal par hi namaaj padhi
 Along with this, the police told the organizers that they can do video conferencing but ensure that the law is not violated in any way during the debate
 yah ek ranneeti thi taaki aayojak pradarshnakariyon ko bheetar ghusane se na roak paaen
 But an hour before Rushdie's proposed video conferencing began, the police sealed the entire area
 yahaan tak ki usne aayojan sthal aana chaah rahe schuli chaatro se bhari bason ko bhi ek kimi pehle hi roak diya
 a few minutes before the organizers started video conferencing, the police asked their unarmed soldiers to surround the front lawn, allowing the organizers to realize the seriousness of the threat and give up their intentions
 unhone niraash hokar video conferencing radd kar di
 Surrender surrender Ram Pratap Singh, the owner of Diggi Palace, who became famous through this conference, also liked to follow the government
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki video conferencing ke liye ijaajat se unhone hi inkaar kiya
 Sanjay Roy, the voice of the organizers, had to leave the cancellation statement in the middle incomplete as he was marginalized
 gahalot kii kamyaabi uttar pradesh ke chunaav main aise shaks ke rup main bhunaai jaaegi jinhone rushdi ko apane rajya main nahin aane diya
 Gehlot eventually succeeded in propagating the point of all Muslims becoming dangerously violent
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki musalamaanon ko hinsak samudaay ke rup main prachaarit karne kaa gahalot prashasan kaa tir uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko mahangaa padataa he yaa bhaajapa ko hindu vot dilaaegaa!

 NDTV has come to know from sources that the Telangana bill will be introduced in Parliament today and the government is committed to getting it passed
 sutron ne bataaya ki sadan main virodh pradarshan ke chalate agar is vidheyak par charchaa nahin bhi ho paati he, to bhi sarkaar ise paas karaayegi
 However, it can prove to be a crook for the government, as so far the main opposition party BJP, which is supporting the Congress-led central government on this bill, has made it clear that the government passed this bill amid the absence and uproar of all the stakeholders in the house
 Should not be attempted
 bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne telugana gathan ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karne ke chalate sansad se nilambit kiye gaye sabhi 16 saansadon ko nae rajya kii gathan kii charchaa main shaamil hone kii anumit die jane kii maang karte hue kaha ki andhra pradesh kaa ek dhada isse gaayab nahin rah saktaa
 Significantly, the people of Seemandhra, who are opposing the formation of Telangana, are concerned that after the formation of the new state, they will get only a small portion of electricity, water and revenue
 is vajah se is kshetra ke tamaam netaa is vidheyak kaa purajor virodh kar rahe hai

 YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy, who is protesting against the bifurcation of the state, accused Congress President Sonia Gandhi of dividing the state for political gains
 jantar mantar par apane samarthakon ke saath dharne par baithe jagan ne aarope lagaaya ki sattarudh dal ne rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banane ke ekmaatr uddeshy ke saath rajya ko vibhajit karne kaa vichaar pesh kiya, kyonki use ummid he ki telugana main tiares ke sahyog se vah kuch siten jeet saktaa he
 Referring to the Italian origins of Sonia Gandhi, Jagan Mohan called the Indian National Congress the 'italian National Congress' and said "even the British did not do what they did in my state of Andhra Pradesh
" unhone kaha ki rajya ke vibhaajan ke virodh main congress ke ek saansad dwaara sansad main kaali mirch ke powder kaa upyog kiya janaa vastav main simandhra ke saansadon ko nilambit karne ke liye congress kaa shadyantra tha
 Jagan Mohan Reddy alleged, Congress was behind the uproar
 unhone isaki sajeesh rachi thi
 He is well aware that practically he is not going to get success, so he did it
 chunaav se maheenon pehle unhone mere rajya ko tod diya
 He said that Seemandhra mps were suspended in an undemocratic manner to raise their voice
 sattarudh dal telugana ke gathan ke liye vidheyak ko bina bahes karaae paarit karnaa chahta tha
 Speaking to NDTV, the YSR Congress leader said that he is ready to support any leader who can help us keep Andhra Pradesh united, and bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is no exception

 inamen se ek the legendary diarector david leen
 In fact, David Lean did his fourth marriage to Leela Welingkar of Hyderabad
 david ko bhartiya filmon kaa shauk tha or lila ke chalate david kii hindi cinema main kaaphi ruchi bad gai thi
 David was established in Hollywood by directing the film 'the Bridge on the River Kwai', which won 7 Oscars at the Oscar Awards
 ve apni nai film laurence of arabia ke liye casting kar rahe the
 David did not want to hire a European actor to play Prince Sherif Ali in this film, rather he was looking for a strong actor from the subcontinent for this role
 isi film ke liye ve dilip kumaar ke paas pahunche kyonki bhartiya cinema main ruchi ke chalate ve dilip ke kaam se waakif the
 Any actor could have agreed to work with David Lean, who had won 7 Oscars for his previous film, but Dilip Kumar refused to play Prince Ali's role
 dilip ko hollywood kaa khaas aakarshan nahin tha
 According to a report, he has not written much about this film even in his autobiography but it is believed that he refused to do in this charismatic film of David because he felt that he would look outsiders in this film
 dilip kaa ye role iske baad omaar sharif ko mila tha or is film ke saath omaar ne hollywood main staradam hasil kar liya tha
 The film was nominated for 10 Oscar Awards in 1962 of which Lawrence of Arabia won 7 Oscar Awards
 david leen ne best diarector kaa auskar jeeta
 Omar Sharif's role was also nominated for an Oscar Award
 is film main prince ali kii entry ko cinema ke itihaas kii sabase yaadgaar entry main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 Lawrence of Arabia is also considered one of the best films in the world but according to Dilip Kumar's wife Saira Banu, Dileep had no interest in moving to Hollywood
 khaas baat ye he ki isi film main ek or bhartiya ai es johar ne do minute kaa role kiya tha or is role kii bharat main kaaphi charchaa hui thi
 This decision of Dilip Kumar may be personal but it can also be called the most shocking decision in the history of cinema because Dilip aka Yusuf Khan missed out on becoming a superstar of global cinema with this decision
 japani auto diggaj sujuki ne bharat main ek nai kruger bike Intruder launch kii he
 This is the Inspire from the company's high end bike Intruder M1800 which has an engine of 1,800cc
 Suzuki Intruder main 155cc kaa ingine he or isaki dilli exange showrooms keemat 98,340 rupee he
 This bike will give a tough competition to Bajaj Avenger, the second cruiser segment bike in India
 dizin kii baat karen to yah Intruder M1800 se milti julati he or ise ek kruger banane kii puri koshish kii gai he
 However, its chassis is of the same Suzuki Gixxer which the company launched long ago in India and it has also become popular
 isame diya gaya ingine 14
 Generates power of 8 PS and torque of 14NM
 yah bike 5 speed minial transmishan ke saath aati he
 It has a fuel capacity of 11 liters and its engine is not a fuel injection but a carburetor
 Intruder 150 main Intruder 1,800 kii tarah hi triengular hedlamp diya gaya he or isame dual seat seoup he jaisaa aam taur par kruger bikes main dekhne ko miltaa he
 This bike has disc brakes in both front and rear wheels and for safety, it has also been given ABS standard
 iske alaava isame elidi tail lits di gai he
 The company has claimed that Suzuki Intruder will give a mileage of 44 kilometers per liter
 kuch duusare fitures kii baat karen to isamen Dual Exhaust die gaye hai or isamen digital consol diya gaya he
 The Suzuki Intruder features three 17-inch spoke alloy wheels
 front main 41mm kaa telescopy fork he rier main 7 step monoshock diya gaya he
 This bike looks great to see, because the price of the bike it inspires is about 16 lakh rupees
 kruger bike ke shaukeenon ke liye ab bazaar main ek nayaa opshan he or saath hi maujuuda bajet kruger bike avenger ke liye kadi takkar bhi he
 Although the price of the Avenger is about 20 thousand rupees less than the Intruder, but if a good option is in the market then people will definitely want to try it

 Where work is not done, the party has the right
 lekin maine bahut kaam kiya phir bhi peeth peeche raajnneeti hui
 Aam Aadmi Party workers were acting wrongly

 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal said on Dhir's rebellion that people who do not get tickets make similar statements
 haalanki kejariwal ne yah bhi kaha ki party ne tikat bantwaare par abhi koi nirnay nahin kiya he

 While many people do not do yoga due to laziness and busyness, there are many people who feel that yoga is only part of Hinduism
 unhen lagata he ki yoga karne se ve apane dharm ke prati vafaadaar nahin rah jaaenge
 It is completely wrong to think
 aisa isliye kyonki yoga koi dharmik kriya nahin balki sharir ko swasth rakhane kii ek vaigyanik kala he
 Sadhguru argues that Hindus have discovered this, but this does not mean that Yoga has also become Hindu

 He gave the example of LK Advani ji and said that today BJP is not behaving properly with its senior and elderly leaders

 When NDTV asked him if the Balakot attack was going to make any impact in the elections this time, Shatrughan Sinha said that every Indian nation is a devotee today
