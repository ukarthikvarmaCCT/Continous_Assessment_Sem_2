 Shiv Sena will work for the farmer and solve the grief of the farmer
 uddhav kaa kaarykram bhale hi pehle se tay ho, lekin mantrimandal main shaamil shivasena ke kisi bhi mantri ke kaarykram main maujuud nahin rahane se donon partiyon ke rishton par sawaal to uth hi rahe hai
 Uddhav's program may be pre-decided, but questions are being raised over the relationship between the two parties due to the absence of any Shiv Sena minister in the cabinet
 padosi deshon ke saath chal rahe seemaa vivaadon kii prishthbhumi main china ne shanivaar ko aise deshon ko kadaa sandesh dete hue kaha ki vah shantipurna madhyamon se rajanyik sambandhon ko aage badhaate hue apane kshetra kii ek-ek inch jameen kii raksha karne ko patibaddh he
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an annual press conference on the sidelines of the ongoing National People's Congress here that we will not take anything that is not ours but we will protect an inch of our land
 unke samvaadadaata sammelan main bharat kaa sidhaa zikr nahin kiya gaya, lekin unhone japan par khulaa hamalaa bolaa or apane padosi dwaara dakshini china sagar par china ke daavon ko chunauti die jane par kadi tippaniyan kin
 Significantly, there have been repeated incursions by Chinese troops into Indian territory and China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as southern Tibet, which is part of the ongoing dispute between the two countries over the four-thousand-kilometer long Line of Actual Control
 
 china kii padosi deshon ke saath rajanyik niti ke sambandh main kiye gaye sawaal par unhone kaha ki ham chote deshon ko kabhi pareshaan nahin karenge lekin chote deshon ke gairavaazib aaropon ko bhi sweekaar nahin karenge
 The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have been questioning China's autonomy claims on several islands in the South China Sea
 haalia maheenon main in deshon ke samarthan main america dwaara aawaaj uthaae jane ke baad yah mudda or garma gaya he
 Wang said that China's neighborhood is overall stable and positive
 unhone kaha ki china kuch deshon ke saath apane kshetreey or jahajrani vivaadon ko aitihaasik tathyon or antarrashtriya kanoonon ke aadhaar par, shantipurna tareekon, samanta or samjhaute ke aadhaar par uchit tareeke se niptaana chahega
 Wang said that there would be no change in this situation
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki china apane padosi deshon or logon ko vishwa kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha main sudhaar se hone vaale phaaydon ko hasil karne kaa mauka degaa
 On the recent confrontation in relations between China and Japan over the islands in the East China Sea, Wang said that there is no scope for agreement on the two issues of doctrine, history and territoriality
 mantri kii yah tippanee china or japan ke bich kshetreey or aitihaasik vivaadon par badhate tanaav ko darshaati he

 somvaar ko party netaaon ne nae netaa ke netritv main phir se sarkaar banane ke liye daawa pesh karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 Opposition leaders Sushil Kumar Modi and Ram Vilas Paswan are likely to fall in the near future of the state government
 paswan ne to apane kaaryakartaaon se kah diya he ki ve november-disambar main chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahen
 By the way, assembly elections in Bihar are to be held in october-november 2015
 duusari ore, endie chaahegi ki chunaav jald se jald ho jaaen kyonki lok sabha chunaav main bijepi or uske sahyogi algepi va araspi ne bihar main jabardast pradarshan kiya he
 Obviously, the party would like to repeat this performance in the assembly elections
 jaahir he agar loksabhaa ke chunaav parinaamon ko aadhaar mana jaae to yah tay he ki endie vidhansabha chunaav main bhi jediu or argedy ko dho daalegi
 According to the Lok Sabha elections data, NDA was ahead in 173 out of 243 assembly constituencies
 bihar main loksabhaa kii 40 siten hai
 Only 122 seats are needed to get a majority in Bihar Legislative Assembly
 agar loksabhaa chunaav ke aankadon ko aadhaar banaaya jaae to us hisaab se endie ko do tihaai bahumat mila he
 The BJP was ahead in 121 assembly seats on its own
 ram vilaas paswan kii party algepi ne 35 or araspi ne 17 vidhaan sabha siton par badhat banaai
 Mathematics of edge: In the Lok Sabha elections, there were many areas in which the BJP maintained its full lead
 inamen patna sahib, siwan, gaya, aurangabad, gopalganj, ujiyarpur, purvi champaran, mujffarpur or shivahar hai
 BJP was ahead in each of their constituencies
 ram vilaas paswan kii party ne munger, vaishali or jamui lok sabhakshetra ke har vidhansabha kshetra main badhat banaae rakhi
 The RLSP maintained an edge in every assembly constituency in Karkat and Sitamarhi
 lalu prasad kii party argedy, congress or ensipi ke gathbandhan ne 50 siton par badhat banaae rakhi
 RJD got an edge over 32 assembly seats
 congress or ensipi ko kram se 13 or 5 siton par badhat mili
 The situation of the jdu-communist Party alliance was bad
 jediu ko mahaj 18 vidhansabha siton par badhat mili thi
 The CPI had an edge over just one seat
 aitihaasik gandhi maidan main mahagathbandhan kii swabhimaan raily kitni safal rahi iskaa faisla to vidhansabha chunaav main hi hoga
 But even in the presence of all the political giants, the highest applause and headlines were given by RJD chief Lalu Prasad
 lalu ravivaar ko apane puure form main dikhe
 In his own special way, through snatches, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were varakiya, while removing the file and pocket, he also attacked the policies of the Modi government in a new way
 lalu kaa yah andaaj isliye nayaa tha ki ab tak vah shabdon kii baazeegari or jumalon ke jariye hi virodhiyon par waar karte rahe hai
 But in this rally, he responded to the Modi government in the same way on the basis of figures written in newspaper clippings and slips kept in pockets in a green file
 argedy pramukh ne kaha-- bijepi kahin se bhi daliton kii party nahin he
 - Modi talks of development
 gujarat kii baat karte hai, lekin vah bataaen ki aaj gujarat kii haalat kya he
 - The Prime Minister canceled his Bhagalpur rally today because he is afraid of the strength of our alliance and this rally
 - narendra modi ne ganga ko dhokhaa diya he
 - He talks about smart city, but Lalu wants smart village, not smart city
 - bihari murkh nahin hai
 Narendra Modi has insulted Biharis
 - bijepi yadavon ko todna chaahati he, lekin yah sambhav nahin he
 Yadav can never leave Lalu
 - vobihar kii bolilgate hai par pyaaj kii keemton kaa kya
 Onion price increased to 40 rupees, 50 rupees, 60 rupees, 80 rupees
 - wo kehete hai nitish ke saath lalu mil gaya jangalraj aa gaya
 So is there Jungle Raj in Bihar because of the Yadavas
 - narendra modi bihar main sampradayik sauhaard bigaadna chaahate hai
 He wants to fight Hindus and Muslims
 - main kahana chahta hum ki ye jangalraj-2 nahin, balki mandalraj-2 he
 The train originating from the hills of Mandar has now connected Bengal to Jharkhand
 bengal ke rampurhaat se dumka hote hue jharkhand ke mandarhil tak jane vaali yah train yahaan ke logon kaa safar aasaan karne ke saath baba bhole kii nagari vaidyanath dham, basukinath, maluti mandir or masanjor dham bhi pahunchnaa or aasaan ho gaya he
 This first passenger train of the new route was flagged off by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu from Delhi

 The journey of 15 kilometers was reduced
 is railkhand par malgadee seva kii shuruyaat beete 23 agast ko hi shuru ho chuki he
 Now, the passenger service has become very convenient for passengers
 is maukey par railmantri suresh prabhu ne kaha ki jharkhand ke nivaasiyon ke liye yah rail line seva kii bahut jarurat thi
 He told that in the year 2001-02, rampurhat-mandaral (via Dumka) 130
 20 kilometre is line ko manjuuri di gai thi
 Now it is ready
 railway adhikari bataate hai ki is line se jharkhand ke paryaton ko kaaphi badhaava milegaa
 The pilgrimage to the religious places here, especially Vaidyanath Dham and Basukinath, will become easier
 vahiin bengal ke paryaton ko bhi badhaava milegaa
 Because Rampurhat falls in Birbhum district of Bengal, which has its own historical significance

 chunavi nateezon se nayaa voting trend saamne aayaa he
 BJP has performed better in rural areas than in urban areas
 jabaki congress shahari siton par jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 In the Gujarat assembly elections, the BJP returned to power only by winning urban seats while the Congress dominated rural seats
 lekin karnataka main iskaa ulataa hua
 When the Congress focused on urban seats, the BJP acquired political land in its rural areas
 rajya main gramin kshetra kii 166 vidhansabha siten hai
 Of these, 74 seats are BJP Comili
 jabaki congress 57 siten hi jeet saki
 On the other hand, JDS has got 33 seats and 2 seats
 karnataka ke shahari kshetra main 56 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 The BJP has won more than half its seats
 bijepi kareeb 30 siten jeetne main safal rahi he, jabaki congress ko 20 siten or jedies ko 6 siten mili hai
 The Congress could not do so well in the urban area in the last election
 bijepi ko shahrishetra ke janaadhar vaali party kaha jaataa rahaa he
 But the BJP has broken this myth in Karnataka
 party ne shahari kshetra se zyada gramin ilaakon main behatar pradarshan kiya
 Farmers also played an important role behind this
 karnataka ke 222 vidhansabha siton ke aae nateezon main 104 siten bijepi ko mili hai
 While Congress has got 78 seats and 37 seats in JDS account
 iske alaava 3 siten anya ke khate main gai hai
 The Congress has lost 44 seats compared to the last assembly election, but has been successful in saving its vote percentage
 jabaki bijepi ke vot fisadi main bhi badhotaree hui he
 Railway has already given 57 new trains to this state in the last two and a half years before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and is now preparing to bring nine more new trains to this state, which is very important for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of the Center

 She tries to impose her immediate intentions on the facts of history and when she finds that history is not attuned to her thoughts and propositions, she starts to shrink or stretch to suit her needs
 loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill par chal rahi bahes ke dauraan jab bijepi adhyaksh or grih mantri amit shah ne bharat-vibhaajan ke gunaah ke liye congress ko zimmedaar tehraana shuru kiya to darasal ve itihaas ke saath yahi khilwaad kar rahe the- ek myne main yah us bhartiya raashtra rajya kii avadharana se vishwasghaat bhi tha jo aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan is desh ne gadhi or jiske peeche kam se kam hazaar saal kii parampara kaa bal tha
 Actually it is not very difficult to identify the culprits of partition of India
 nihsandeh in gunahagaaron main muslim lig ek he
 But she is not the only culprit
 bijepi kabhi-kabhaar jin ram manohar lohia ko uddhrut karti he, unhone apni kitaab 'bharat vibhaajan ke gunahagaar' main bantwaare kii jo aath vajahen ginai hai, unamem duusare number par congress netritv kaa utaar he or aathven number par hindu ahankaar
 His words were- 'opposition to fundamentalist Hinduism for partition was really meaningless, because hardcore Hinduism was definitely one of the major powers dividing the country
 yah usee tarah thi jaise hatyara, hatya karne ke baad apane gunaah maanane se bhaage
 There should be no mistake or mistake in this regard
 akhand bharat ke liye sabase adhik va ucch swar main naaraa lagane vaale, vartmaan jansangh or uske purv pakshpaati jo hinduvad kii bhaavana ke ahindu tatva ke the, unhone british or muslim lig kii desh ke vibhaajan main sahaayta kii
 He did nothing to bring Muslims closer to Hindus under one nation
 unhen ek duusare se pruthak rakhane ke liye lagbhag sab kuch kiya
 Such separation is the root cause of partition
 pruthakta kii niti ko angikaar karnaa, saath hi akhand bharat kii bhi kalpana karnaa apane aap main ghos aatmavanchanaa he
 So the self-discipline that Lohia referred to continues even today
 lekin lohia jis samay kaa zikr kar rahe the, vah azaadi se kuch pehle kaa samay tha
 Whereas the idea of two separate nations appears in Hinduist thinkers as early as the twentieth century
 jane-maane krantikari, samaaj-sudhaarak or raajnneetik kaaryakarta bhai paramanand ne apni kitaab 'da story of life' main is baat kaa ullekh kiya he ki unhone baqayada do alag-alag rashtron kii kalpana kii thi
 He writes that Lala Lajpat Rai had written many letters to him, in which one asked how India should be formed in the future? In response to this question, Bhai Parmanand wrote a few lines
 unka maananaa tha ki sindh ke paar afghanistan or uttar pashchimi seemaant praant tak ek vishaal muslim rajya hona chahie
 He was of the opinion that the Hindus should leave this area and the Muslims of the rest of the region should leave and go to this area
 haalanki bhai paramanand ne kitaab main inhen panktiyon ke bich sweekaar kiya he ki un dinon unhone hindu muslim ekta kii waisi kalpana nahin kii thi jo baad main dikhi
 Move on from brother ecstasy
 ab is baat ko phir se duhraane kaa matlab nahin ki vinayak damodar saavarkar ve duusare hinduvadi netaa the jinhone dvirashtrawaad kii pariklpana ko aage badhaayaa tha
 In his famous article 'hindutva' he laid the theory of two-nation theory
 unke ek saal baad lala lajpat raay ne musalamaanon ke liye alag desh kaa naqsha khinch daalaa
 For Savarkar, the criterion of Hindutva was so great that his organization was accused of killing the country's largest Hindu - Mahatma Gandhi
 khud saavarkar is maamle main aaropee banaae gaye
 He was released due to lack of evidence
 gandhi kii hatya main saavarkar kii bhoomika ab lagbhag sarvagyaat he, lekin kam logon ko maaloom he ki saavarkar ne jinna ko bhi maravane kii koshish kii thi
 Yashpal has written this in detail in his autobiography 'overview'
 yashpal chandrashekhar azaad ke krantikari dal ke sadsy the
 He has explained in detail how Savarkar's elder brother told him in Akola that the enemy is not just English, but there are more people
 unhone peshkash kii ki agar yashpal or unke krantikari sahyogi mohammad ali jinna ko maar den to ve unhen pachaas hazaar rupee denge
 The crisis is that current scholars of history either rely on Google's knowledge or on documents prepared in English by the British - they do not know or feel true about a Hindi novelist
 yashpal ne likhaa he ki chandrashekhar azaad ne jab yah prastaav suna to naaraaz hote hue kaha ki saavarkar kya unhen bhaade ke hatyare samajhate hai
 Needless to say that at the other end of this two-nation theory there was also a section of Muslim intellectuals including poets like Allama Iqbal who wrote songs like 'saare Jahan Se Achcha' which we still repeat
 jinna ne ise raajnneetik haqiqat main badal diya
 It was the same Mohammed Ali Jinnah who had been called by Sarojini Naidu, the messenger of hindu-muslim unity
 ye vahi jinna the jo kilaafat andolan ke kilaaf the kyonki unka maananaa tha ki isse majahabi kattarta badhegi
 Then what happened from the third decade of the twentieth century that Jinnah gradually became a politically staunch Muslim? Looking for the answer to this question, Amit Shah's point seems to be partly right
 congress ke bahut saare netaa un dinon hindu hiton ke pravaktaa the
 But the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which came into existence in 1925, did the job of interpreting Hinduist politics and Hindu interests as a principle and bigger than the freedom struggle of the country
 yah baat kam hairaan nahin karti he ki aresas ko arase tak is desh kii azaadi kii ladaai se koi matlab nahin rahaa, balki uski koshish is ladaai ko kamazor karne kii rahi
 The hindu-muslim divergence that emerged in the coming days, which saw riots - to which Dr
 Lohia has pointed out in his book - was the Sangh's policy behind it which had the indirect support of many Congress leaders
 to bharat vibhaajan kii asli gunahagaar vah vichaardhaara thi jo hindu-muslim ko alag-alag maanati thi or jiskaa phayda angrezon ne uthaaya
 Then it is this ideology which believes that there was a partition on the basis of religion and India and Pakistan were divided
 lekin phir yah ek durvyakhya he ki pakistan musalamaanon ke liye bana or bharat hinduon ke liye
 The truth is that Pakistan was made for those who believed that the country should be divided on the basis of religion and India belonged to those who believed that the country should not be divided on religious grounds
 beshak donon jagahon par sampradayik shaktiyaan apana khulaa khel khelti raheen or isliye bahut saare aise log bhi apane-apane mulk chhodane ko majaboor hue jinhen aisa vibhaajan manzur nahin tha
 This catastrophic tragedy of history has become increasingly frequent because the organizations in this country have become stronger, which have promoted religious discrimination and communal tension
 aazaadee ke baad ke bharat ko naagarik samta ke adhikaar par jitna samvedansheel hona chahie tha, utana vah nahin hua- yah ek badi sachai he or iske liye phir congress kii bahut sari sarkaron ko bhi zimmedaar tehraana hoga
 It is also to be reiterated that the Congress did not do the work that India should have done to strengthen the inclusive inclusive nationalism that it had developed during the war of independence and to form an inclusive dream constitution
 lekin aaj jo shaktiyaan nayaa bharat bananaa chaahati hai ve azaadi kii viraasat ke saath zyaada bada dhokhaa kar rahi hai
 She wants to erase the history of a thousand years of India and take it after her
 na vaigyanik taur par yah sambhav he or na aitihaasik taur par
 Therefore, this attempt is making such a truncated distorted psychology in which the matter is being coordinated, but the work is getting unpleasant
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill bhi isi manovriti kaa hissaa he
 In the name of the persecuted minorities in neighboring countries, it is being realized within the large community of the country that they are not being considered as first class citizens
 beshak, is desh kii apni paramparaayen or azaadi ke baad tamaam tarah kii araajaktaaon or saamanti chalan ke baavjood dhire-dhire viksit ho rahaa iskaa loktantric mizaaj is vichaardhaara ko majaboor karte hai ki vah kam se kam bayanon ke str par puri udaartaa kaa pradarshan kare
 But the bigger truth is that this liberal tradition seems to be losing at the moment and its results will be very harmful for this country
 beshak, yah desh aisi takaton se kahin zyaada majboot sabit hoga, lekin tab tak jo bahut sari kharonchen dilo-dimaag par pad chuki hongi, unase ubarne main vakt lagegaa

 Openers Hales and Jani Bairstow then took over the innings
 beresta ne tisare over main rampal par pari kaa pehla chaukaa jadaa jabaki agle over main helles ne samual badri par lagaataar do chauke maare
 England, however, managed only 29 for two in six overs of the power play

 Bairstow succumbed to this pressure and, in an attempt to lift Gayle's ball, caught Pollard at long on

 Earlier, Gayle and Charles shared a 103-run partnership in 11 overs to give the team a stormy start

 dilli main pichley kuch saalon main radio cab sarvice lagaataar badi he
 But the horrific incidents of their drivers have raised many serious questions on them
 Today we are introducing you to a similar incident in which the driver of the Uber cab not only caused an accident but robbed the injured instead of sending him to the hospital to die in the jungle
 Left for
 apane 20 saal ke bete ko kho chukaa parivaar ubar jaisi companiyon kii jimmedaari tay karne ke liye pichley ek saal se insaaf kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 The pain of the passing of 20-year-old young son Shammi Ahmed can be seen even today in the eyes of mother Hadija
 pichley saal 15 march shammi kii maut hui thi, parivaar abhi bhi us kaali raat ko nahin bhula paa rahaa he jab unhone kol centre main kaam karne vaale apane honhaar noujvaan bete or bhai ko kho diya
 On 13 March 2016, when Shammi was returning home, the driver of the Uber cab rammed her
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki ubar main baithi mahila ne police or ubar donon ko phone karke ghatana kii jaankaree di
 Seeing the crowd gathering, the driver said that he was taking the injured to the hospital
 cab main baithi mahila ko vahiin utarkar driver use hospital le jane ke bajaay shammi ko lootakar vasant kunj ke jangalon main patake kar chalaa gaya
 When Shammi did not come home, the family called her, then the police said that she had been admitted to the hospital
 use sar main gahari chot ai thi
 Doctors also underwent surgery but could not be saved from excessive bleeding and on March 15, the hospital declared him dead
 mujeec ke shaukeen shammi ne apni maut se do din pehle hi ek guitar kharida tha jise parivaar ne aaj bhi sahej kar rakhaa he
 The family alleges that the police did not show any interest in nabbing the accused driver
 3 hafte baad parivaar ne hi use dhundhakar police se giraftaar karavaaya
 The family says that Uber did not take any action even after the complaint of the woman boarding the cab
 police ne bhi ubar ke khilaaf ab tak koi maamla darj nahin kiya he
 The family also has the mail of the woman aboard in the cab in which she asked what happened to the boy who had an accident with the cab, but Uber did not even consider answering the mail
 jab hamane ubar se baat kii to wo bhi maamle ko gambhirtha se lene ke bajaay usase pallaa jhaadte hue hi najar aae
 In the last one year, everyone has written for the family justice, from the Home Minister to the Delhi Police Commissioner, but no one has come forward to help the family
 parivaar main shammi sabase honhaar or padhaa-likhaa kamaane vaala tha
 After her departure, the family's financial condition has also worsened
 sab taraf se niraash parivaar ab is maamle main kanoonee madad lene kii koshish kar rahaa he taakiubar jaisi companiyon kii jimmedaaritay ho ki agar uske driver is tarah kaa vahishiana kaam karte hai to ubar jaisi companiyon bhi agar koi kadam nahin uthaati he to unke khilaaf bhi kadi karwai ko sunishchit kiya jaae
 The family says that if Uber had kept a watch on the driver instead of hiding the matter and Shammi would have been sent to the hospital on time, his life could have been saved
 lekin ubar parivaar se abhi bhi baat tak karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 The whole world knows to what extent there is enmity between Israel and Palestine
 donon desh ek-duusare ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa ek bhi mauka nahin ganvaate hai, lekin is baar ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he, jise jaanakar log hairat jataane ke saath bhavuk ho rahe hai

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav wants to keep his clean and development image at the center for the upcoming assembly elections
 unki chunauti samaajawaadee party se sirf saaf-suthri chhavi ke ummidavaaron ko utaarne kii he
 During his entire Chief Minister's tenure, Akhilesh has periodically tried to keep criminals and Bahubali away from him
 jisase chunaavon main yah aarope party par na lag sake ki pita or chachaa kii tarah unke darbar main bahubaliyon ko prabhaav he
 He wants to keep such people away from the election summer
 chunaav main tikat nirdhaarit karne kii unki vivaadit list main aapraadhiyon or bahubaliyon ke naam shaamil nahin hai
 At the same time, his name is included in his list of the party's national president and state president
 yah koi pehali baar nahin he
 Even before this, the party had distanced criminals and Bahubalis from itself just before the election
 aise apradhi or bahubali independet yaa anya partiyon se chunaav ladakar jitate hai or phir samaajawaadee party kaa daaman tham lete hai yaa phir baahar rahete hue bhi har sambhav madad karne ke liye tatpar rahete hai
 If they do not contest under the banner of the party even in the upcoming elections, then they will become important in the exercise of forming a government when the election results are coming
 phir 1991 or 1993 main nirdaleey or 1996 main pehali baar samaajawaadee party ke tikat par vidhayak chune gaye

 lekin 2007 main bispi netaa raju paal kii hatya main namjad hone ke baad atik ko samaajawaadee party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Now, once again due to tickets from the party, Atik's name is in the news

 SP chief Mulayam and state unit president Shivpal merged Mukhtar's party with his party, then Chief Minister Akhilesh opposed it
 gauratlab he ki samaajawaadee party mukhtaar ke khilaaf bhi pratyaashee nahin utaarti he
 At the same time, Mukhtar's elder brother Afzal Ansari has been a four-time MLA on the SP ticket from Ghazipur and once an MP
 vahiin pichley chunaav main duusare bade bhai sibatullah ansaari sapa ke tikat par chunaav jite the
 Raghuraj Pratap Simharghuraj Pratap alias Raja Bhaiya first became an independent MLA in 1993
 haalanki samaajawaadee party ne raja bhaiya ke khilaaf maidan main party kaa ummidavaar nahin utaara tha
 The Samajwadi Party consistently supports Raja Bhaiya from outside
 philhal vah rajya sarkaar main mantri he
 Significantly, in 2002, he supported Mayawati by becoming the chief of independent mlas in the BSP-BJP alliance but withdrew his support after not being given a ministerial berth
 aagaamee chunaavon main bhi ummid kii ja rahi he ki raja bhaiya nirdaleey chunaav ladenge
 Raja Bhaiya got support from the BJP in the elections of 1993 and 1996, and in the elections of 2002 and 2007, 2012, the Samajwadi Party supported him and helped him get elected as an independent MLA

 Mulayam was forming his own party and DP Yadav had to catch up with politics in politics
 mulaayam or deepi ek duusare ke natural ban gaye
 Mulayam gave DP a ticket from Bulandshahr and won this election easily and he became the MLA for the first time
 pehali jeet ke baad hi mulaayam ne unhen mantrimandal main bhi jagah de di
 But the increasing proximity of Mulayam and DP led to the departure of both
 mulaayam ne party main deepi ke badhate prabhaav ko lagaam lagane ke liye samaajawaadee party se baahar kar diya
 After this he continued to contest against the Samajwadi Party and the people of the Mulayam family
 gauratlab he ki pichley chunaav se pehle deepi ek baar phir samaajawaadee party kaa daaman thaamna chaahate the lekin is baar akhilesh yadav ne unki entry par brake laga diya tha

 maharashtra ke dalit netaa prakaash ambedkar ne mangalvaar ko congress par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa he jisamen unhone kaha ki congress ke vichaar aresas se mail khate hai
 After this statement by Ambedkar, the possibility of electoral alliance between his party Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) and Congress is under threat
 ambedkar ne samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue yah bhi kaha ki kendriya mantri or bhaajapa saansad nitin gadakari aresas ke agle pradhanmantri honge
 Actually, Ambedkar was present in the press conference where he said that the Congress is on the path of soft Hindutva against the staunch Hindutva of the BJP
 naram hindutv or manuwaad par congress or aresas ke vichaar mail kha rahe hai
 The RSS is the ideological guide of the BJP
 aresas kaa mukhyalay nagpur main heambedkar kaa bayaan aise samay main saamne aayaa he jab congress loksabhaa chunaav ke liye maharashtra main prastaavit mahagathbandhan main bibiem ko shaamil karnaa chaahati he

 bi aar ambedkar ke pote prakaash ambedkar vibivie ke liye 12 loksabhaa siton kii maang kar rahe hai jiske liye congress taiyaar nahin he
 The Congress has made it clear that it will not include communal AIMIM in the Grand Alliance
 Former Telecom Minister a Raja was remanded to four-day CBI custody on Thursday by a special CBI court for questioning in connection with his role in the 2G spectrum allocation scam
 saath hi swaan telecom ke pravartak shahid osman balava ko bhi chaar din kii sibiai hiraasat main bheja gaya he
 Special Judge OP Saini sent both of them to CBI custody saying that keeping in view the serious nature and facts of the case, the investigation agency's request to send both the accused to four days police custody seems justified
 jaanch agency ne donon se kai anya dastavejon kii baramadagi, aropiyon se ek-duusare se saamne poochtacha karne tathaa dastavejon kaa hawala dekar unase poochtacha karne ke liye unki police hiraasat avadhi badhaane ke liye kaha tha
 The judge said, the prayer is granted
 donon aropiyon ko 14 farvari tak police hiraasat main bheja jaataa he
 Raja was arrested on 2 February and sent to five-day CBI custody the next day
 8 farvari ko jaanch agency ne raja ko or do din kii sibiai hiraasat main bhej diya gaya, kyonki jaanch agency ne adaalat se kaha tha ki aaropee poochtacha main sahyog nahin de rahaa or jawaab main taalamatol kar rahaa he
 The CBI requested Raja and Balwa to be sent to custody for four days for questioning and said that it was necessary for further investigation
 usne kaha ki balava kii giraftaar jaruri thi, kyonki vah agency se batch rahaa tha
 The agency's lawyer Akhilesh said that the custody of the two is necessary because they need to be confronted with each other and they will be interrogated citing various documents recovered by the CBI in the course of investigation
 unhone kaha ki balava swaan doorsanchaar main share bhagidaari se sambandhit dastavej nahin de rahaa he tathaa vah agency se tathy chipa rahaa he
 The CBI lawyer said, he is a very influential person
 raja or balava, donon ke hi vakeelon ne sibiai ke anurodh kaa virodh kiya
 Balwa's lawyer Vijay Kumar Aggarwal claimed that his client had appeared in the CBI office 27 times for questioning
 unhone kaha ki yadi aaropee jaanch main sahyog de rahaa he, to uski giraftaar yaa hiraasat main poochtacha kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Balwa's counsel also argued that no person can be detained unless the offense is of a serious nature
 agarwal ne kaha ki unka muvakkil jaanch agency ko sahyog de rahaa he
 He said that Balwa was called to the CBI office on 6 and 7 February, while his mother was admitted at Lilavati Hospital due to heart disease at that time
 unhone kaha ki jaanch agency ne is tathy ko chhipate hue balava ke khilaaf gaiyr-jamaanti warrant hasil kar liya ki vah agency ke saath sahyog kar rahaa he

 Diamond businessman Nirav Modi looted such a huge amount of money and no one was aware of it
 aakhir kaise hui ye lut? santhganth or shaatir dimag ke gathjod ne kaise diya is ghotaale ko anjaam, padhein kaise banaaya gaya lut kaa plan?1-neerav modi, unki patni emi neerav modi, bhai nishal modi or mamaa gitanjali james ke mehul chaukasee kii milkiyat vaali companiyaan-diamond or yues, solar expotrers or stailer diamonds –pienbi ke afasaron ke paas gayi or unke letters of anderteking (aloyu) jari karne ke liye kaha, is saakh patron ke jariye ve saarvajanik kshetra ke duusare bainkon kii videshi shakhaon se aayaat ke liye puunji ugaah sakati thim
 What happened: PNB officials - Gokulnath Shetty and Manoj Hanumant Kharat - issued lous without taking mandatory bail / bank guarantees
 2-pienbi 30 hindustani bainkon kii videshi shakhaon ko swift pranali ke jariye sandesh bhejtaa he or uske graahak ko jarurat ke mutabik karj dene ke liye kahata he, swift sandeshon kaa kaam sanbhaalane ke le teen shaks mukarrar the jinhen is pranali tak password se surakshit pahunch hasil thi
 What happened: One accused officer knew three passwords
 sandesh bhi do hi logon ne bheje maaloom dete hai
 On getting the information through 3-SWIFT, these banks deposit the amount in pnb's Nostro account
 yahi vah khaataa he jisamen in bainkon ko honkong sthit shakhaaen pienbi kii jarurat ke mutabik rakam bhejti hai
 What happened: It is not clear whether the receiving bank sent back the bank's note to the PNB branch and regional office
 koi kharte kii ghanti nahin bajaai gai
 4-PNB would have paid this amount to Modi and his companies, but they used it only to pay back the previous debt
 modi kii companiyon kii guzarish par pehle vaale aloyu ko badhaate hue ek nayaa aloyu taiyaar kiya jaataa he or is baar isamen chukaaye jane vaale byaaj ko bhai shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 What happened: Swift's transactions were not matched with pnb's core banking system
 kul milakar 11,000 karod ru
 More than one of these Nostro transactions was not flagged as a threat
 5-karjon kii evergreening (yani nae karj lekar byaaj chukaaya jaataa rahaa or mul jas kaa tas bana badhata rahaa)
 The game of this goes on for years, after all, the amount increases very much as it happened in the present case
 15 farvari ko darj sibiai kii exiar kahati he ki akele 2017-18 main modi or unki companiyon ne pienbi se 143 aloyu jari karvaa karke 4,886
 72 crores Rs
 lut liye
 What happened: The auditors posted at the branches of the bank are expected to verify the transaction
 shakha prabandhak swift lenden vaale register kii samiksha karte hai, bainkon se jari kiye gaye aloyu harek timahi main arabiai ko bheje jate hai
 All these processes were bypassed
 6-ghotaalaa tabhi saamne aayaa jab aise videshi lendenon kaa kaam karne vaali pienbi kii us khaas khidki par kaam karne waalon ke chehre badale
 When Modi's company came to PNB for a new lou, he was asked to bring sufficient bail
 modi kii companiyon ne is par etraj kiya or kaha ki aise patr pehle bhi bagaiyr kisi huzzat ke jari kiye jate rahe hai
 7-this led to ringing of alarm bells at PNB and internal investigation revealed that the bank had to shell out Rs 280 crore
 kaa chuunaa lagaaya ja chukaa he
 Only then did the CBI register an FIR against Modi and his family members and other PNB officials on January 31 for criminal conspiracy, cheating and misuse of government positions by public servants
 8-pienbi ne 15 farvari 2018 ko bisai ko bheje gaye notice main kaha ki ghotaalaa 11,400 karod ru
 Belongs to pienbi ke sheyaron ke daam ludhak gaye or unke saath duusare soochibaddh bainkon ke sheyaron kii bhi keemat giri

 Azam Khan enjoys taking a pinch and has a mastery in smothering his target
 urdu shaayar 
 Cass Rampuri had once said: Come there, the skill of misleading, go, now be lucky
 nawabi prishthbhumi vaala rampur kai chizon ke liye mashr he
 Its distinctive style of Urdu literature and the world-famous Raza Library, but here one thing is used as an idiom, which is called Rampuri Khanjar in the common dialect
 badalte vakt ke saath vah to bazaar se gaayab ho gaya he, lekin ek ghaatak alankaar ke rup main uskaa astitv abhi tak bana hua he
 Now big leaders like Mohammad Azam Khan have started using their tongue like this dagger, which they easily put in the hearts of their friends and enemies
 pichley hafte yantranaadayak pidaa kaa ehsaas karne kii baari mulaayam singh yadav ke avatar or khanjar jaisi hi jabaan rakhane vaale amar singh kii thi
 Azam Khan, who very cleanly cut friends with his daggers, recently upset Bollywood actress Jayaprada during a public function
 unka har shabd mohatarama ko cheerata gaya or ve sabake saamne ro padin
 Earlier, he lashed out at Mulayam Singh for forging a friendship with the Hindu Hriday Samrat Kalyan Singh, who had demolished the Babri Masjid during his chief ministerial tenure and who proudly took responsibility for it
 ab laluhaan hone kii baari amar singh kii thi, jinhen 'party chhodane' kii baat kehani padi
 But Azam Khan escapes with his Rampuri because Mulayam Singh does not want to disturb the Muslim community on the eve of elections
 mulaayam ne kaha bhi, ''ham dost hai, ham bhai hai
 He also said that Azam Khan is a part of the Samajwadi Party
 yahi nahin
 Azam Khan enjoys pinching and has mastered the art of disturbing his target with a smile
 kehete hai ki mulaayam singh ke shashan kaal main jab ve mantri the to unhone apane sahyogi haji yaqub kuraishi ko khub sataaya tha
 Is the SP divided into two factions simply because of MP Jayaprada, and two well-known leaders Amar Singh and Azam Khan are threatening to leave the party, while their prince Mulayam Singh is watching this battle with helplessness
 mulaayam kii chintaa din-pratidin bad rahi he kyonki unhen lagata he ki sanghathan main foot party ummidavaaron kii sambhaavnaaon ko kuprabhavit kar sakati he
 In such a situation, they are trying to pour cold water on the internal fighting of the party, but they have not been successful
 6 april tak sthiti kuch niyantran main thi or sabko pataa tha ki purv mantri tathaa sapa ke jane-maane muslim netaa ajam khan pichley kuch samay se naaraaz chale aa rahe hai
 The friendship with Kalyan Singh provided him the opportunity to object to his leader Mulayam Singh
 unhone dhamkee bhi di thi, ''main babari masjid dhane vaale ko kabhi bardaasht nahin karuunga
 Along with this, he started missing out on party forums and meetings
 mulaayam singh ne unke saath mulaakaat kar unhen manaane kii koshish kii
 The hide-and-seek game between the two was going on that on 6 April, Amar Singh exploded, saying, "enough is enough
" main ajam khan ke nakhre or unke haathon apmaan ko or bardaasht nahin kar saktaa
 Azam Khan is indispensable for Mulayam ji
 party main meri koi bhoomika nahin he
 Mulayam ji can live without me
 ''party ke bheetar-baahar apane pratidwandviyon ke bare main amuman kadava bolne vaale amar singh pehali baar laachaar, peedit evam rakshaatmak mudra main dikhe
 Till now, anyone who attacked Amar Singh fought against him, but he never expressed his intention to leave the party
 us din mulaayam singh dilli main the or amar sah ke bokhalane kii khabar milte hi sann rah gaye
 He did not expect that Amar Singh would threaten to leave the party
 unhen party mukhyalay main jaakar netaaon se milanaa tha, lekin unhone vah kaarykram radd kar diya
 Mulayam and Amar Singh got caught in some khichdi, which reflects that Amar Singh called select journalists at his residence in Lucknow at around 11 pm and said in rhetorical language that he is a loyal soldier of Samajwadi Party and Mulayam Singh They have leaders
 ve is duniya ko to chhod sakate hai, par samaajawaadee party ko nahin
 He also said that he wants to get some rest, not allowing his health to work full
 sankshep main, unhone spasht kiya ki ve mulaayam singh ke prati vafaadaar bane rahenge, lekin kinare hi rahanaa pasand karenge
 Amar Singh is a generally flexible person who does not associate respect with issues
 ve ad gaye ki ve ajam khan ke saath samjhaute ke mood main nahin hai, jo jayaprada ke maamle ko lekar unase bhidate aae hai
 Jayaprada was made the party's candidate from Rampur Lok Sabha constituency in 2004 against the wishes of not only local veteran but also MLA from the district, Azam Khan
 ajam khan ke sari takat laga dene ke baavjood amar singh jayaprada ko is chunaav kshetra se chunaav jitwa le gaye
 This was nothing short of a shock for Azam Khan, who is known for being blunt, dumb, and confined to his constituency
 ajam khan ko lagata he ki ve sapa main musalamaanon kaa cheharaa hai, par asal main aisa nahin he
 Mulayam Singh is popular among Muslims, not because Azam Khan is with him, but because he took a firm stand on the Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi dispute and by ordering firing on kar sevaks to save the disputed structure in Ayodhya in 1990
 He took the risk of putting his political career at stake
 uske baad se mulaayam singh kii dharmanirpeksh pahchaan ban gai or ajam khan kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin thi
 Being a loyal and senior member of the party, Azam Khan is exploiting Mulayam Singh
 ve kalyaan singh mudde kii aad main mulaayam singh par dabaav daal rahe hai ki rampur se jayaprada kii ummidavaari waapas lene kii unki maang maan len
 If this is not the case, then in 2003, when Kalyan Singh's National Revolution Party was supporting the Samajwadi Party government, why did Azam Khan keep his face stitched
 itani badmijaaji ke baad bhi ajam khan ne abhi samaajawaadee party ko chhodane kii himmat nahin dikhaai he kyonki unhen apni simaaon kaa pataa he or ve apane saamne bache simit vikalpon ko bhi jaanate hai
 Due to this, Amar Singh got the relief unhen lagata he, mulaayam singh ko svakendrit khan ke aage ghutane nahin techne chahie the
 He feels that despite doing so much for the party — taking the Samajwadi Party out of the borders of Uttar Pradesh, connecting big movie stars like Amitabh to Sanjay Dutt and Nafisa Ali, forming various alliances at the national level — he Why can't you claim to take only one seat out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 unke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki netaji ajam khan ko manaane kii prakriya main amar singh kii andekhi kar rahe hai
 Mulayam Singh is not facing this situation for the first time
 ve na to amar singh se or na hi ajam khan se khush hai, par chunavi prakriya ke chalate ve unamem se kisi ko bhi hataane kaa jokhim nahin le sakate
 If Azam Khan vows to polarize Muslims against him, then Amar Singh is aware of many of his political matters
 yah mulaayam singh hi the jinhone benny prasad verma or raaj babbar athwa saleem sherwani jaise apane vishwaston ko hataane main ek second bhi nahin lagaaya lekin khud ko party kii jimmedaari se mukt kar dene kii amar singh kii ichha ko purna karne main unhen kai baar sochna hoga
 His care has not come yet
 lekin ek baat nishchit he or vah yah ki jis tarah kaa vyavhaar amar singh or ajam khan kar rahe hai, usase ve party par boj hi sabit honge
 If they continue on this path, then Mulayam Singh Brigade will be hindered in the electoral arena
 sonia gandhi kii beemaari ke chalate doosraa maukey tha jab kisi or ko congress mukhyalay main jhanda fahraana tha
 In 2011, senior Congress leader Motilal Vora took up this responsibility, but at that time Rahul was just general secretary
 isliye unhone khud vora ji se jhanda fahraane kii guzarish kii thi
 He is now the party vice president and is about to become president soon
 isliye abaki baar rahul ne hi jhanda fahraaya
 When Rahul came, there was a lot of punishment
 He came to the Headquarters of the Congress, and with him came Sonia's political secretary Ahmed Patel
 jhandarohan sthal tak mukhyalay ke prabharee motilal vora lekar aae
 That means only Rahul was in place of Sonia
 pehle ke mukaable party daftar kii sajaavat behatar thi
 After all, the opportunity was the future of Congress
 rahul bhi clin shev, sar par gandhi topi or safed kurte pajame main the
 There was a flag hoisting, a national anthem, our song was held high and then the program ended with the national anthem
 phir rahul ne sabhi logon se mulaakaat kii or manmohan ke saath milakar bacchon ko mithai banti
 After meeting the leaders, Rahul teased Modi, after which Rahul met the party leaders in a closed room
 sutron ke mutabik rahul ne charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki aap logon ne piem kaa bhaashan suna, kya rahaa? phir kya tha, ek-ek karke netaaon ne modi ko rahul ke saamne nishane par liya
 On Balochistan, Ahmed Patel said in front of Rahul that the Congress should put its line against Pakistan
 yahi kahana chahie ki pakistan kii kashmir par kii ja rahi bayaanbaji katai bardaasht nahin kii ja sakati
 Pakistan should see the situation here
 ambika or aaazaad bhi boleiske baad ambika soni ne kaha ki vikaas or vaayadon ke mudde par piem fail ho rahe hai
 Therefore, political bets are going on by referring to Balochistan
 vahiin aaazaad ne kaha ki piem ke spich kaa str piem kaa nahin he
 According to Bhide Anand Sharma and Shakeel Ujjama Ansarisutra, the front was taken over by Anand Sharma
 modi ke bhaashanki har baat kaa vistaar se vishleshan karne lage
 Congressmen started talking among themselves that Anand was busy in increasing the number
 isi bich congress netaa shakeel ujjama ne anand sharma ko tokaa or bolne se roak diya
 Shakeel said that Anand ji, small things are being analyzed, but the big matter is something else
 shakeel phir rahul se mukhaatib hue or bole ki modi ne pakistan ke baluchistan kaa zikr karke hindustan main apni hindutv kii chhavi or hindu vot bank ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 Dealing with which should be the priority of the party
 aap is bare main sochie or rodmap banaaie
 Manmohan said - Our government's plans are counting Modi
 Generally speaking, former Prime Minister Manmohan also took a dig at Modi in front of Rahul
 manmohan ne kaha ki modi sarkaar upie sarkaar kii yojanaon ko aage badha rahi he
 Some are being renamed but taking credit for themselves
 modi ke bhaashan par sabaki sunakar bhi chup rahe rahulrahul ne bhale hi khud modi ke bhaashan par apane netaaon kii pratikriya lee
 But himself kept silent
 naa band kamare main kuch bole or naa baahar media ke saamne, haalanki congress ke varisht netaaon ne kaha ki laal kile se modi nahin desh ke piem bhaashan de rahe the
 Therefore, being the top leadership of the Congress, neither Sonia nor Rahul answers on the day of independence
 ek mauka aisa bhi jab senior netaa ne bhul sudhaar karairahul ke liye is khaas maukey par sab kuch thik rahaa
 But there was a time when senior leaders told Dabi Juban that Rahul should take senior leaders along

 Actually it happened that when Rahul hoisted the flag, he did not wave in full display

 The program went on

 Congressmen were seen speaking with a sarcastic tongue that if they continue to take the advice of Rahul senior leaders properly, then the political crop of the withering Congress will also rise

 Left leader d Raja has said that in 1989 VP Singh managed to form an alternative government but in 2019 no VP Singh is in Indian politics
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav kii kshetreey dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat or ek nae fedral front banane kii koshishon ke sandarbh main raja ne ye baat kahi he
 The Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao, who was struggling to create a new political front, met DMK President MK Stalin on Monday
 is mulaakaat main maujuud tiares saansad bi vinod kumaar ne enditivi se kaha "chunaavon ke baad ek nayaa raajnneetik morcha (political confederation) saamne aayega
 Who will lead this new front will be decided after the results
 "lekin emke stallin ne mangalvaar ko aisi kisi bhi sambhaavna ko nakaar diya
 Stalin said that in the current situation there is no possibility of a third front
 ke chandrashekhar raav kii mushkil ye he ki left bhi unke saath khadaa nahin dikh rahaa he
 CPI leader d Raja told NDTV, as in 1989, there is no VP Singh in Indian politics in 2019
 abhi hamaare saamne modi or amit shah hai, jinhen haraana he
 Can't say anything on whether the Federal Front will be there or not
 sharad pavaar kii ensipi bhi chandrashekhar raav ke samarthan main nahin he
 DP Tripathi, NCP leader said, "I think there will be no separate front of regional parties
" chunaav ke baad vipaksh or majboot or ekajute hoga KCR ko vipakshi partiyon ke saath aana chahie
 While the Congress termed Rao's attempt as imaginary
 randeep surajevaala, pravaktaa, congress ne kaha gaalib dil bahalane ke liye khyaal acha he
 The discussion of the third or fourth front in Indian politics is proof that some regional parties are trying to find an alternative to BJP and Congress

 The mantra for success of any performance is not to chase the record
 main sochataa hum ki ‘khel kaa lutf uthaane kaa sabase acha tarika kya he or kaise main is maje ko badha saktaa hum’
 Enjoying the game has played a key role in Tendulkar's success in the last two decades

 hatya ke maamle main abtak 6 aropiyon kii giraftaar hui hai jinamein se teen ko motihaari police ne or teen ko nepal police ne giraftaar kiya

 Questioning the working style of the police, accused Deepak's uncle RS Ram said that both of them were kidnapped on 25 December and they had brought their bodies from Nepal on 28th
 motihaari police ne is maamle main 14 janvari ko maamla darj kiya or 17 janvari ko maamle kaa khulaasa karte hue kaha ki is ghatana ke peeche iesai kaa haath he or kanpur main hue rail haadason main bhi inhen logon kii sajeesh hone kaa shaq jataayaa he

 3 - Do not stand around any building
 4-agar aap aisi building main hai, jahaan lift ho to lift kaa istemaal katai na karen
 In such a situation it is best to use the stairs

 Similarly, Rishita Bhatt, who failed to achieve any major success in Bollywood, also took the command of filmmaking
 unka bhi hashr apni anya hamraah jaisaa hua
 The film could not be painted on its face
 abhinetriyon ke asafal nirmaataa banane ke bare main film vishleshak komal nahata kehete hai, ''adhiktar actress choti star cast or chote bajet ko lekar chalati hai
 In such a situation, till the story will not be extra-ordinal, there is no question of the film being a hit
 '' iske saath hi abhinetriyon film nirmaan main risk bhi kam uthaane main yakeen karti dikhti hai
 Whatever be the reason for his steps

 bihar ke mukhyamantri or jadyu ke varisht netaa nitish kumaar ne buudhvaar ko sweekaar kiya ki mahila aarakshan ko lekar unki party ke bheetar vaicharik bhinnata he par party main vighatan kii koi ashanka nahin he
 On the question asked in the media about the discussion with the party's national president Sharad Yadav on the issue of women's reservation bill and the breakdown in the party, Nitish said that there is ideological difference in the party, but the breakdown of the party regarding this is baseless
 nitish ne kaha ‘janata dal you ke bare main jo khabaren aa rahi hai uske bare main main bahut jaankaree nahin rakhata par mahila bill ko lekar jo sthiti he uske bare main mere man main spashtataa he
 He said "there are two opinions within our party on the question of women's reservation
 My opinion has changed
" ’ nitish ne kaha ‘main bhi is raay kaa tha ki bill main pichhade virgon kii mahilaon ke liye praavdhaan kiya jaae or is aashay kaa apana note varsh 1996 main jab is vishay ko lekar sansadeey samiti gathit hui thi to uske sadsy ke rup main diya tha
 'he said' But four years ago in Bihar, we gave 50 percent reservation to women and after that we saw the empowerment of women here, their awareness and consciousness
 uske baad meri raay main jo thodaa badlaav aayaa vah yah tha ki mahila vidheyak ko paarit kiya jaae or pichde varg kii mahilaon ko iske bheetar aarakshan or sthaan dilaane ke liye alag se pahal jari rakhi jaae
 Nitish Kumar said that it is not appropriate to stop that bill seeking to make a provision for quotas in the Women's Reservation Bill
 mahilaon kii aakanksha he or yah nyaay sangat baat he isliye ise ab roka nahin janaa chahie
 He said that the time has come for women to be given one-third reservation in the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies
 nitish ne kaha ‘is bare main meri raay main jo badlaav aayaa he uske tahat maine apni party ke sabhi saansadon or netaaon se yah apil kii ki iske bare main ve punarvichaar karen
 He said that out of the 7 JDU mps in the Rajya Sabha, at the time of passing the bill, 5 mps present there voted in its favor
 nitish ne kaha ki jab loksabhaa main ise laayaa jayega to vahaan bhi party saansadon dwaara iske bare main nirnay liya janaa chahie
 He said that though he has been talked to many mps of the party about this and has made them aware of their opinion, therefore this difference of opinion can be honestly called a difference of opinion but it does not mean that there is any in the Janata Dal u There is another problem
 unhone kaha ‘yah ek vaicharik baat he or aisa kai dfa hota he kisi bhi dal main ho saktaa he isapar zyada dhyaan dene kii aavashyakta nahin he
 'nitish Kumar said,' i have been saying before and i would like to reiterate even today that the only difference on the issue of Women's Reservation Bill is that i want the Bill to be passed and later give quota to the backward class within it The matter of leaving is to be raised, while some of our colleagues say that no, we should discuss it first, then we will discuss it
 ’unhone kaha ‘yah ek vaicharik bhinnata he hamen ek duusare kaa aadar karnaa chahie or kisi bhi loktantric dal ke bheetar aisa ho saktaa he yah koi vicitra paristhiti nahin he
 In response to a question asked by Lalu about the women's reservation bill, Nitish said that he never stood by one thing

 corporate jagat kii kuch pramukh hastiyon kaa maananaa he ki gathbandhan kii sarkaron kaa arthvyavastha ke liye bura hone vaali dharna galat he
 Many industrialists, after exercising their franchise, said that a coalition government is not bad for the economy
 aisa lagata he ki corporate jagat har halaat ke liye apane ko taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Needless to fear, the opinion of Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra after voting on Monday at a polling station in South Mumbai indicates that there is no need to fear coalition governments
 unhone patrakaron se kaha, 'ham sabhi main pragati evam vruddhi kaa keedaa samaa gaya he
 If a coalition government comes, it will also follow these paths and it is beneficial for us
 'anand mahindra ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad centre kii satta main chaahe jo bhi aae, bhale hi vah gathbandhan sarkaar hi kyon na ho, use vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 Mahindra said this after giving his vote at a booth in Malabar Hill in Mumbai South Parliamentary constituency

 After voting, he said, "there have been coalition governments at the center and they have given good governance

 In my opinion, our democracy is very mature and we have seen good governance of coalition governments
 isliye main chintit nahin hum
 Jindal said that there is a need to work on issues like industrial growth, jobs and security

 Deepak Parekh of HDFC said that local issues were dominated during the voting
 unhone kaha ki vah centre main ek sthir sarkaar chaahate hai
 Among the heavyweights of the corporate world who voted in the fourth phase of the general elections were Governor Shaktikanta Das of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Anil Ambani, head of Reliance ADAG, Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Group, chairman of Tata Sons

 Many experts feel that after these elections there may be fragmented results, in spite of this the people of Indian business hope that reforms will continue and the government will increase its expenditure to increase consumption, so that capital formation and domestic demand will also increase

 com / og9mzj5tya— Esha Deol (@esha_deol)december 8, 2016 Encouraged by the Congress's landslide victory, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has sought support from the main opposition party BJP for the start of a new chapter
 singh ne vipaksh ke netaa laalkrishna adwani se kaha, ''hamen sarkaar or mukhya vipakshi dal ke bich sambandhon ke naye adhyay kii shuruuaat kerani chahie
 We need your support
 '' pradhanmantri karyaalay ke sutron ne bataaya ki adwani ne samprag kii jeet kii badhai dene ke liye manmohan ko phone kiya tha
 Earlier in his first reaction to the Congress' victory, Singh asked the Left parties and other secular parties to forget the old differences and come together to form a strong and stable government
 unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke saath press conference main kaha ''mujhe ummid he ki sabhi dharmanirpeksh partiyaan puraane matbhedon ko bhulaakar saath aayengi taaki desh ko majboot sthir or sarthak sarkaar di ja sake
 We will work in the spirit of comradeship
 ''singh ne vam dalon or anya dharmanirpeksh dalon ko diye sandesh main kaha ''ham sabhi vipakshi dalon ko aamantrit karte hai ki ve is samay duniya ko dikhaa den ki aise samay main jabaki vishwa gambhir sankat se jujh rahaa he, ham ekajute raashtra ke rup main khadey hai
 '' bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki mere virdohi meri raajnneetik hatya karnaa chaahate hai
 Addressing the mlas at the Janata Dal United Legislature meeting on Monday evening, Nitish made it clear that the support of the Modi government at the Center on black money is not bjp's support
 nitish ne apane vidhayakon ke saamne do took shabdon main kaha ki kisi mudde par samarthan ke stand ko raajnneetik karavat se jodna galat he
 Nitish dismissed the news of his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in the media, calling them rubbish
 nitish ke bhaashan se saaf tha ki vah bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah dwaara pehle twit kar or phir apane bhaashan main kaale dhan ke mudde par nitish ke samarthan ke liye dhanyavad dene ke baad se shuru hui raajnneetik atakalon par viraam lagaana chaahate hai
 Nitish admitted that people have been facing difficulties due to lack of preparation on this issue
 alag-alag mudde par apane stand kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne bataaya ki upie ke shasankaal main jab jiesti laayaa gaya tha tab bhaajapa ke saath rahane or us mudde par unke virodh ke baavjood unhone samarthan kiya tha, lekin iskaa matlab unhone congress kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Similarly, during the presidential election, he also supported Congress candidate Pranab Mukherjee
 tippaniyan Nitish satirized on the media and said that people interpret my opinion on political questions according to their mind and an attempt is made to end my political life
 is baithak main nitish ne bhaajapa par puure desh main unmaadi or sangheey dhaanche par prahaar karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Nitish also referred to some objectionable slogans raised by BJP members in Bihar Legislative Council on Monday, saying that raising matters which are not related to the state is unethical and contrary to political decorum
 is mudde par rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ne nitish kumaar se baatcheet bhi kii thi or is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki unhen maaloom chalaa he ki sadan main janata dal united ke parshad mook darshak bane rahe
 Nitish said in front of his mlas in two words that it is wrong to associate the stand of support on any issue with political turn
 nitish ne media main ai pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah se unki mulaakaat ko khabaron ko khaarij karte hue unhen bakawaas qaraar diya
 It was clear from Nitish's speech that he wants to put a stop to the political speculation that has started since BJP President Amit Shah first tweeted and then thanked Nitish for his support on the black money issue in his speech
 nitish ne mana ki is mudde par taiyaari ke abhaav main logon ko pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa par rahaa he
 While discussing his stand on a different issue, Nitish said that when the GST was brought under the UPA regime, he supported the BJP and despite his opposition on that issue, it did not mean the support of the Congress
 did
 vaise hi raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan unhone congress ummidavaar pranab mukherjee ko bhi samarthan diya tha
 The comments nitish ne media par vyangy karte hue kaha ki raajnneetik sawaalon par meri raay kii log apane man ke mutabik vyakhya karte hai or mere raajnneetik jivan ko khatm karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In this meeting, Nitish also accused the BJP of attacking rampant and federal structures throughout the country
 nitish ne somvaar ko bihar vidhanparishad main bhaajapa sadasyon dwaara kuch aapattijanak naare lagane kii bhi charchaa karte hue kaha ki jo maamle rajya se jude nahin hai unhen uthaanaa aniatik or raajnneetik maryaada ke vipareet hai
 Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav also spoke to Nitish Kumar on this issue and complained that he came to know that the Janata Dal United councilors remained silent spectators in the House
 nitish ke bhaashan se saaf tha ki vah bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah dwaara pehle twit kar or phir apane bhaashan main kaale dhan ke mudde par nitish ke samarthan ke liye dhanyavad dene ke baad se shuru hui raajnneetik atakalon par viraam lagaana chaahate hai

 She belongs to Scheduled Tribe (ST) and is married to a 'white foreign girl'
 mandir ne shaadi karwaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Suresh Kumar and Belgian maiden Sarah Roseman have been married for 9 months
 maamla kuch is kadar pechida ho gaya ki jila adhikariyon ko bich main aana padaa lekin aisa lagata he ki maamla sulataane ke liye yuvati ko bharat main saital hone se pehle belgium waapas janaa padegaa
 Suresh Kumar met Sara on a ship where they both worked

 vah yahaan rahanaa chaahati hai or yahaan basane ke liye unhone belgium main apana hotel jiskaa ashink malikana haq unke paas bhi tha, ko bech diya tha
 Suresh said that the local temple of Namakkal district had refused to get him married but now both have got married in a small temple
 haalanki documents ikattha karne ke chakkar main registration karne main dikkat aa rahi he
 Suresh, who lives in the Koli Hills area of tamil Nadu, says- Now that i have married a white woman
 
 They are still causing problems
 tippaniyan Temple officials refused to say anything about this, saying they were helpless
 chunki sara chrishchiyan hai or videshi hai, is tarah kii shaadi ko vaidhata dene kaa koi praavdhaan he hi nahin
 Sara said, 'suresh was very helpful
 
 
 main unke phone kaa intjaar kiya karti
 
 or mujhe tab laga ki main unase pyaar karti hum
 She also said that she feels very attached to Indian culture and traditions
 boleen, 'jab tak meri shaadi kaa registration nahin hoga tab tak mujhe vija nahin milegaa ki main bharat waapas aa sakuun or rah sakuun
 i want to stay here ' The temple refused to get married
 suresh kumaar or belgium kii yuvati sara rojeman kii shaadi ko 9 maheene ho gaye hai
 The case became so complicated that the district authorities had to come in the middle but it seems that the girl would have to go back to Belgium before settling in India to settle the matter

 ) We and you cannot deny from this fact that till now a few years ago, the way used to express love has changed a lot
 pehle ke pyaar main aaj kii tulana main kahin adhik maasoomiyat hua karti thi
 Take for example the films of that time
 us vakt kii filmon ko dekhakar or aaj kii filmon main pyaar ke izhaar karne ke tareeke ko dekhakar antar saaf najar aata he
 In the past, where people used to write love letters to express love, today there are facilities like whatsapp and chat
 us daur main prem patr likhnaa or phir use saheli ke haath bhijwaana, pyaar ke izhaar kaa yahi ek tarika tha
 Writing a love letter was a slow process, but it was more effective than any of today's options
 prem patr likhakar aap vaaki apane priy ko ye samajha sakate hai ki aapke dil main kya chal rahaa he
 It is accepted that it is better to express love than to shout loudly to someone and take the help of loving words and write letters
 aaj ke yuvaaon ke man main aksar ye sawaal umadte-ghumdate rahete hai ki jin baton ko ham kahkar bataa sakate hai, unhen likhakar samajhane kii kya jarurat
 But you know during writing, not your mind, your heart gives you command and when the matter comes out of the heart, it will reach the heart
 visheshgyon kii maane to prem patr likhnaa darasal pyaar ke izhaar kaa sabase behtareen tarika he
 If you too want to express love to someone and you do not understand how to express love, then there is hardly anything better than writing a love letter
 agar aapke man main ab bhi kuch shankaaen hai to ye baaten aapaki uljhan ko dur karne main madadgaar sabit ho sakati hai:1
 The best way can be presented by writing emotions
 Experts believe that while expressing love by speaking to someone, we want to say a lot but forget
 lekin likhane ke dauraan ham apni sari bhaawanaaon ko puri tarah se vyakt kar sakate hai
 That too with sweet words
 2
 The simple way of expressing love, the more simplicity in love, the more beautiful it becomes
 kisi ke prem patr kaa intjaar karnaa, uski khushboo ko mahasoos karnaa, ye sabakuch jitna sada he or utana hi kargar bhi
 3
 shabd kabhi marate nahiprem patr ek aisi cheez hai jinhen aap saalon-saal sahejkar rakh sakate hai
 They always keep your love new
 aap samay-samay par un khaton ko nikaalkar, pyaar kii us pehali pahal ko yaad kar sakate hai
 The safety of the metro has always been the target, but this time a woman hollowed out this claim when a video of her jumping in front of the metro train came out
 lekin aap dekhakar hairaan rah jaaenge kaise ek mahila train ke saamne kuudati to he lekin sahi salaamat batch jaati he
 In this 48-second video footage, it is clearly visible how a woman is waiting at the empty metro station in a relaxed manner and as soon as the train comes closer, the woman puts her bag on the platform Leaving directly in front of the metro train jumps onto the tracks and the train passes over it
 ye sab kuch itani teji se hota he ki train ke payalat ko iske jawaab main harakat main aane kaa mauka bhi nahin miltaa he lekin jaise hi train guzar jaati he, wo mahila patari se puri tasalli se uthati he or bina kharonch khadi hokar apni sahi salaamat hone par shaayad aashcharya jaahir karti he or phir use ek surakshakarmi use plateform par waapas khinch letaa he
 After these pictures appear, the question that first sparks a war in the mind is that which metro station are these pictures from? When is this incident? Was there no one else at the station at that time and the most out of the question, who is intent on revolting in the mind, how did that woman survive safely despite jumping ahead of the metro train? So let us also answer the questions related to this video Be disclosed
 ye tasviir jahangirpuri se gudgaanv ke bich chalane vaali metro train ke civil line metro stesan kii do number line kii hai
 This incident is on June 9 of this year, that is, Sunday evening at five o'clock, that is, it was also a weekly holiday between the summer holidays
 matlab saaf he ki us vakt metro stesan par aam taur par bheed na ke baraabar rahi hogi or civil line stesan par to shaayad us vakt ek-do hi musafir rahe hon
 But the question is more big, how the woman survived despite jumping in front of the metro, because the opinion of the officers associated with the metro service itself is that in such cases it is impossible for anyone to escape, then how the woman survived
 darasal plateform se patari ke jis hisse main wo mahila kudi thi, vahan ek gadde kii vajah se utana hissaa duusare hisson ke mukaable thodaa gaharaa zyada tha, jisaki vajah se us mahila or train ke bich kaa faasla itnaa zyada ho gaya ki wo metro train kii chapet main aane se batch gai

 In a very important decision, the Rajasthan High Court on Monday excluded the Jat community of Dholpur and Bharatpur districts from the reservation list, while in the remaining districts of Rajasthan this community will continue to get the benefit of reservation

 Delhi's Women and Child Development Minister Rakhi Birla once again roamed the streets of Delhi overnight
 raakhi sabase pehle sanjay gandhi aspataal gai, uske baad dilli ke teen alag-alag rain baseron main jaakar vahaan kaa nirikshan kiya
 Rakhi also reprimanded the officers after seeing a lot of dirt everywhere
 jab dilli ke log so rahe the, aapaki sarkaar kaam par thi
 Rakhi Birla, the youngest minister in the Delhi government, went out on the streets last night to sort out the problems of common people's night shelters
 mongolpuri, raja garden, ajadnagar, dilli get, har jagah rain baseron kii avyavashtha dekhakar raakhi baras padin
 People were sleeping among the dirt in all places
 unhone logon se baatcheet bhi kii or unki pareshaaniyaan suni
 Not only this, the minister did not even get the right arrangement and answers, and even ordered several caretakers to pick up the bags and leave
 unke saath media kaa bhi kafila tha
 Rakhi did not clear his agenda as soon as he got a chance 
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachariyon ko nahin choda jayega
 The minister has taken the condition of the night shelter, but the big question is that what happened to the promise of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to build 45 night shelters in Delhi within 48 hours on 1 January? His life is over? Another big promise is not fulfilled yet, like the rain shelters

 kya aap jaanate hai ki har maheene kii gai grosri shopping kaa kareeb 30 fisadi hissaa aap jane-anjaane main barbaad kar dete hai
 Yes, according to an estimate, you waste 30 percent of the food you buy every month
 isse keval aapkaa khaanaa hi barbaad nahin hota balki us par lagaae paise bhi barbaad ho jate hai
 But there is nothing to worry because it is not rocket science to avoid this waste
 aap chahen to apni kuch aadaton main badlaav karke aap is samasya se nijaat paa sakate hai
 Let's know 7 tips to save food from ruin, which will save your money along with food
 1
 You will always think that by buying all the cooking items together, you will be able to easily make anything whenever you want, that is, you will get rid of the hassle of collecting the goods everyday
 lekin is chakkar main aap dher sara saamaan kharid lete he joki galat he
 So you should always buy small quantities of goods
 bina vajah frij or aalmaari main saamaan kaa dher lagane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 2
 khaanaa banane se pehle hi menu plan karen yani lunch or dinar se pehle hi soch len ki kya or kitni maatra main bananaa he
 Try to cook as much food as is consumed in a day
 3
 Prepare the goods list before grocery shopping
 isse aapako kharidari ke samay ye pataa hoga ki aapako kya khareednaa hai or kya nahin
 By not doing this, you often forget the stuff for which you have gone and bring it which you do not even need at the moment
 4
 Take advantage of shopping store delivery service
 ho saktaa he ki aapako har duusare-chauthe din kharidari karne jane main aalas aata ho is chakkar main aap ek hafte kaa saamaan ek saath le aate hai
 But instead of doing this, if you order daily delivery items from the delivery service, you will save money and there will be no waste of food at the end of the week
 5
 Learn how to store dry food items properly
 jaise aataa, daal or chaaval jaise sookhe ann ko hameshaa air tite dibbe main hi rakhe jisase ye kharaab na ho
 Sometimes due to this carelessness they go bad and you have to throw them away
 6
 One thing always keep in mind that all the fresh food ie fruits, vegetables, meats and milk should always be kept in the refrigerator, keeping them outside will waste them as well as your money
 7
 There are some food items that go on for months, just need to store them properly
 ham baat kar rahe hai tomato kemp, makkhan, milk maid aadi jinhen aap frij main rakhkar lambey samay tak chalaa sakate hai

 His indication was that Islamabad should send a representative to discuss militancy continuing from across the border
 unhone kaha ‘‘vah jitne chahen, utane patr likh sakate hai lekin isse vaastaviktaa nahin badalegi
 The reality is that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and Pakistan is illegally and forcibly occupied some part of Jammu and Kashmir
 ’’ swaroop ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak jammu kashmir ke andruni halaat kaa sawaal he to ham maanate hai ki pakistan ko is par tippanee karne kaa koi haq nahin he or ham isse nipatane main puri tarah sakasham hai

" galat sandesh ke saath galat deshon main 22 duuton ko bhejne ke bajaay ek doot ko sahi sandesh ke saath sahi desh main bhejnaa behatar hota
 "when asked about the china-pakistan Economic Corridor, Swaroop said that it passes through the sovereign territory of Pakistan's illegally occupied India and is obviously there," he said
 India will worry
 ’’ US Secretary of State John Kerry had said that Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism
 is par videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki bharat ne yah nahin kaha ki vah peedit nahin he

 On Sharif's decision to send envoys to various countries to raise the Kashmir issue, Swaroop said that the only message would be to stop supporting terrorism from across the border, stop incitement to violence in Jammu and Kashmir and interfere in India's internal affairs Stopped on giving
 unhone kaha, ‘‘22 duuton ko vibhinn deshon main bhejne se unke bebuniyaad or asamarthaneey daawey jaij nahin ho jaaenge
 Instead of sending 22 messengers to the wrong countries with the wrong message, it would have been better to send one messenger to the right country with the right message
 ’’ china pakistan aarthik galiyare ke bare main poochne par swaroop ne kaha ki yah pakistan ke gaiyrkanoonee kabje vaale bharat ke samprabhu bhubhag se ho kar gujarata he or jaahir he ki vahaan, ‘‘tisare paksh ke sahyog se banane vaali kisi bhi pariyojna ko lekar bharat ko chintaa hogi hi

 Sharif in his letter to the UN Secretary General has criticized Modi's remarks on Balochistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as undesirable and hostile to the UN Charter
 is bare main poochne par swaroop ne kaha ki daman ke shikaar logon kaa mudda uthaanaa galat nahin ho saktaa
 Swaroop said that the UN resolutions that Sharif is referring to are part of history and there is no point in raising them
 nayi vaastaviktaaon or nae sandarbh main aage badhane kii jarurat he
 He said, "if we talk that this is wrong, then many leaders of the world will come to the dock

 Salman is sometimes seen as a detective who is teaching a lesson to the enemies of the country, or helping the needy like Robinhood
 salmaan kaa puraa focus aise manoranjan par he jiskaa majaa har umr or ling kaa darshak le sake
 While looking at Shah Rukh's last few films, there is a lack of these things

 The government has reduced the period of sale of electoral bonds by five days in May
 is maah yah bikri chah taarikh se shuru honi hai
 The tenure of sale of electoral bonds was earlier fixed at ten days, which has now been reduced to five days
 haal main chunavi bond par supreme court ne bada faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki sabhi dal is sambandh main 30 may tak silband lipaphe main chunaav ayog ko jaankaree saunpen
 The court had directed the Finance Ministry to reduce the limit of buying electoral bonds from 10 days to five days in april-may
 maaloom ho ki isi bich desh main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye vot daale ja rahe hai
 Earlier, the court rejected the Centre's plea not to interfere till the elections
 supreme court ne ko kaha tha ki agar paardarshee raajnneetik chanda ke liye shuru kiye gaye chunavi bond ke kritaon kii pahchaan nahin he to chunaavon main kalaadhan par ankush lagane kaa sarkaar kaa prayaas ‘nirarthak’ hoga
 The Supreme Court had said that all parties will have to give information about the bond
 sabhi dalon ko 15 may tak mili elactoral bond kii jaankaree silband lipaphe main 30 may tak chunaav ayog ko saunp deni hogi
 In this information, details of donors will also have to be given
 vitt mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki ab elactoral bond kii bikri chah may se 10 may tak kii jaaegi
 In the notification issued earlier, this sale was to be held by 15 May
 aam chunaav se pehle sarkaar ne farvari main teen charnon main ek se 15 march, ek se 20 april tathaa 6 se 15 may tak chunavi bond bikri kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The seven-phase Lok Sabha election has started from April 11
 antim charan ke liye matdaan 19 may ko hoga or maton kii ginati 23 may ko kii jaaegi
 The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is hearing a petition by the NGO Association of Democratic Reforms in which the appeal is made to either stop the sale of electoral bonds or make public the names of the donors
 sarkaar raajnneetik dalon ko nakad main milane vaale chande ke vikalp ke rup main chunavi bond lekar ai thi
 The 29 branches of State Bank of India have been authorized to issue and encash electoral bonds
 ye shakhaaen nai dilli, mumbai, kolkata, chennai, gandhinagar, chandigarh, ranchi or bengalooru kii hai
 Electoral bonds have been introduced as an alternative to cash donations to political parties
 isse raajnneetik chande main paardarshita aane kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 The government notified the Electoral Bond Scheme 2018 in January this year
 sarkaar ne is daawey ke saath is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 But what happened is the opposite
 is bond ne paardarshita laane kii jagah jokhim or badha diya he, yahi nahin videshi sroton se bhi chanda aane kii gunjaaish ho gai he
 Dear Mahi, sorry
 
 
 , tumse bahut acchhee jaan-pahchaan yaa dosti nahin he, tab bhi himakat karke or tumse apni or karodon cricket premiyon kii chahat or pyaar kii khatir ‘maahi’ kahkar sambodhit kar rahaa hum
 Hope you don't mind
 bhai, is baat se kisi ko gurej nahin ki tumne cricket ke antarrashtriya patal par bharat kaa naam jitna roshan kiya, utana haal ke dinon main kisi ne nahin
 Made India World Champion in T-20 World Cup to ODI matches
 yahaan tak ki test khilne vaali tiimon ke bich bhi tum hi ne bharat ko number van paaydaan tak pahunchaaya
 These are all such records, which all the superstars like Nawab Pataudi, Vishwanath, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Azharuddin and Sourav Ganguly could not captain
 or inhen sab vajahon se tum or tumhaare midas tach ke mureed desh-duniya ke tamaam log ban gaye
 The India whose tricolor you have flown from the Eden Gardens to the MCC and Lord's, the same flag is crying today
 wo tumhaari bharat maa se berukhi kii vajah jaan nahin paa rahaa he
 He is unable to understand why a person like you who talks cleanly is suddenly silent
 kya tumhaare liye bhi paisa taqatvar ho gaya
 
 
 Is this money so powerful that today you have kept silence because of a millionaire instead of crores of cricket lovers of India
 ye aisa vakt he, jab puraa desh tumhaare isi karodpati maalik ke naam par thu-thu kar rahaa he or tum ho ki apane saathi suresh raina kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe ho (raina kal kolkata airport se baahar aate vakt apane kaanon par headphone pahane the, taaki kisi bhi tarah kaa shor naa sunne kaa naatak kar saken)
 Are these green trillions of notes so important for your family of two or four people that you did not even tell these crores of loved ones why you like the cement of the millionaire owner more than the land of the country
 samaj main nahin aayaa ki jis maati par nange paanv dhoop main daud-daudkar tumne balla chalaanaa siikhaa hoga, wo maati maahi ke liye cement ke saamne bharbarakar gir rahi he
 Mahi, you play well IPL and win too
 ham to bas itnaa chaahate hai ki tum ek baar hamako samajha to do ki aakhir kyon tumhaare liye zaruri he is sabase vivaadit match ko khelnaa
 Mahi, i can understand that today when you see the pictures taken with the big Fakhr with your boss's son-in-law in all the channels and newspapers, snakes will be flown on your heart too
 main ye bhi maanane ko taiyaar hum ki shaayad phixing or batting ke changul se tum bache rah gaye ho, lekin tumhaari chuppi se jo karodon logon kaa bharosa charmara rahaa he, wo sirf tum hi waapas dilaa sakate ho
 Mahi, you will not speak now, when will you speak
 bataa do ki chennai superkings kii pratishtha kaise bharat kii pratishtha se bady he? ye tumko hi samajhaana padega ki INDIA CEMENT, jisamen tum vaais presidence ho, wo kaise INDIA kii captaini se baari he
 If before the IPL final match, we will tell our opinion to the unseen, then tomorrow you and your team (notice i am speaking your team, not Srinivasan's team
 
 
 hamaare liye to CSK ke maalik tum hi ho) ko dil se chiyar kar denge
 Otherwise, i will not even feel like watching
 maahi dost, ab bhartiya cricket kii lokapriyata tumhaare saath jud gai he, ho sake to isko bachaa lo
 At least you can do so much for the game that took you from the floor to the hail
 aise to dagaabaaz tum nahin ho
 
 
 You are one of those leaders who have been taking the responsibility ahead
 yaad he na vanade world cap ke final kii wo pari
 Mahi my brother, if there is any kind of hesitation in opening the tongue, there is any fear, hesitation, please accept it by tweeting
 or bas ipel final ke pehle keval itnaa karo ki apane maan, cricket ke sammaan or desh kii shaan ke khatir itani himmat dikhaao ki kah do ki tum CHENNAI SUPER KINGS ke liye tab tak nahin kheloge, jab tak tumhaare maalik jaanch main saaf-suthere baahar nahin aa jate
 Finally a bitter truth
 
 
 sammaan se jivan jeene ke liye do vakt kii roti hi chahie or tum to itnaa kama chuke ho ki tumhaari kai pushtein aasaani se ghar baithkar kha sakati hai
 As if your friend, lover or friend

 The Supreme Court has said that Delhi has become hell
 yahaan kaa jivan narak se bhi badtar he
 When Delhi becomes hell, there is no need to tell what will happen to the rest of the country
 vaise supreme court ne maharashtra ko narak nahin kaha he
 Hell is discussed only in the context of polluted air
 loktantr main jab samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udne lagen to vah bhi narak hi hota he agar narak hota he to
 It is for the Supreme Court to decide that the Constitution of Maharashtra does not belong to Uri
 26 november ko samvidhan diwas manaate hai
 On this day, the Constitution of India was approved in a form
 isi din supreme court kaa maharashtra main floor test ke maamle main faisla aayega
 On 26 January 2016, when India was engrossed in the celebration of the implementation of the Constitution, President Pranab Mukherjee was signing the recommendation of the Cabinet to impose President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh at 7
57 pm
 sarkaar ke mantri or vakil raashtrapati shashan ke paksh main khub daleelein dete the
 The headline was printed, but seven months later in July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed the President's ruling in Arunachal Pradesh
 tab raashtrapati or rajyapal ke vivekadhikaar or cabinet ke faisle ko sarvocch bataaya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was given by a five-judge bench
 isamen se ek justise khehar ne kaha tha ki jab raajnneetik prakriyaaon kii hatya ho rahi ho to court mookdarshan bana nahin rah saktaa
 You don't have to tell who killed the political process
 zaahir he us vakt jo sarkaar main the unhone kii thi
 Today a judge of the same bench is in the bench of three judges, in front of which is the case of Maharashtra
 justise ve ramanna, justise sanjeev khanna or justise ashok bhushan kii khandpeeth ke faisle kaa sabko intazaar he
 While canceling the President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh, the Supreme Court had said that Governor JP Rajkhowa had acted unconstitutional by calling a meeting of the Assembly on 16 December 2015 even after the due date of 14 January 2016
 adaalat ne rajyapal ke us sandesh ko bhi radd kar diya jo unhone 9 disambar ke rose vidhansabha ko bheja tha
 Said that the Governor cannot decide the agenda of the Assembly
 isliye 9 disambar ke baad vidhansabha ke tamaam faisle avaidh ghoshit ho jate hai
 The Legislative Assembly is restored before 9 December
 yani congress sarkaar waapas apane vajood main aati he
 The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh called the assembly meeting a month before the due date
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki kya iskaa matlab he ki jab bhi rajyapal bor ho jaaen to wo utsaah mahasoos karne ke liye vidhansabha kaa satr bula sakate hai
 Was the Governor's decision based on solid constitutional principles or on his whims
 aap sanvaidhanik vivekadhikaar kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakate hai jab wo kisi sanvaidhanik siddhant par aadhaarit ho, yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? In Uttarakhand before Arunachal, President's rule was canceled
 tab nainital hoicourt ne kaha tha ki raashtrapati koi raja nahin hote jinke faislon kii samiksha nahin ho sakati he
 There can be terrible mistakes from both the President and the Judge
 jab raashtrapati raja nahin ho saktaa to zaahir he rajyapal samraat nahin ho saktaa
 Justice K
 M
 Joseph, who wrote that decision, whose promotion to the Supreme Court was stuck for several days
 nainital hai court ke justise you si dhyani ne floor test kaa aadesh diya tha jise centre sarkaar ne nainital hai court kii dabl bench main chunauti di thi ki raashtrapati shashan ke vakt floor test nahin ho saktaa he
 But on 21 April 2016, Justice Joseph and Justice Bisht upheld the floor test order and asked Harish Rawat's government to prove majority on 29 April 2016
 phir centre sarkaar supreme court gai lekin vahaan se bhi use raahat nahin mili
 On May 10, 2016, floor tests were ordered in Uttarakhand
 yani supreme court floor test kaa aadesh de saktaa he or taarikh bhi bataa saktaa he ki floor test kab hoga
 Not only this, the Supreme Court had said that the assembly will be open for how many hours
 sirf do ghante tak ke liye vidhansabha ko kholaa gaya tha
 There is a dispute about this in the case of Maharashtra
 sarkaar kaa paksh kahata he ki supreme court floor test ke aadesh nahin de saktaa
 The Governor has his own authority
 is maamle main centre sarkaar ek baar maat kha chuki he, kya is baar bhi maat khaaegi, yah to 26 november ke faisle se pataa chalegaa
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi were arguing on behalf of the government in the Supreme Court in the Maharashtra case
 vipaksh kii taraf se abhishek manu singhvi or kapil sibbal
 Tusshar Mehta presented Ajit Pawar's letter
 is patr main ajit pavaar ne netaa vidhayak dal kaa daawa kiya he
 The letter also has the signatures of 54 mlas
 11 anya vidhayakon kaa bhi samarthan patr diya gaya
 In this way, BJP showed the support of 170 mlas
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki rajyapal ke saamne jo saamagree thi usee ke aadhaar par faisla kiya
 The Governor could not conduct an inquiry
 justise khanna ne ek sawaal kiya ki kya mukhyamantri aaj bahumat hai, kya floor test karaayaa jaae
 Mukul Rohatgi said that the question is when to have a floor test
 court ko isamen dakhal nahin dena chahie
 The governor has to decide
 rajyapal ke adhikaar kii nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati
 When the court in Uttarakhand case says that the President is not the king, his decision can be reviewed, then is the Governor above the President
 kya abhi tak supreme court ne rajyapal ke faisle kii samiksha hi nahin kii thi? mukul rohtagi kii daleel he ki kya vaaki supreme court floor test kaa aadesh nahin de saktaa he
 What is the constitutional procedure for how many days should the floor test take place
 is maamle main paramparaon se tay hota aa rahaa he
 Ajit Pawar's lawyer Maninder Singh said that the issue of whether he is in NCP or not is not in the court
 unhone kaha ki ve ensipi main hai or vidhayak dal ke netaa hai
 But NCP has removed Ajit Pawar from the post of Legislature Party leader and its information has been given to the Governor
 yahi nahin ajit pavaar ne jin vidhayakon ko suchi di thi usamen se 53 waapas aa gaye hai
 They are saying that they did not support the Fadnavis government
 unhen dhokhe main rakhaa gaya
 Ajit Pawar's lawyer claims that his letter is legally and constitutionally correct, then it is necessary to know under which section of the constitution his letter is correct
 maharashtra sarkaar ke vakil kyon yah daleel de rahe the ki samarthan kaa patr dene ke baad agar koi sthiti paidaa hui he to rajyapal dekhenge
 So does not this question arise what the Governor has seen so far
 vidhayak khuleam kah rahe hai ki samarthan nahin diya to kya rajyapal ko dobaaraa nahin poochna tha
 Did he not see that Ajit Pawar has also been removed from the post of Legislature Party leader
 vipaksh kii taraf se kapil sibbal ne bahes kii
 Sibal said that in the evening there was a press conference that Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress will form the government
 subah paanch baje raashtrapati shashan hataane kii kya immergency thi
 The court said that President's rule is not an issue here
 court ne kaha ki unke paas samarthan patr he
 Sibal said that he too has a letter of support from 154 mlas
 sibbal ne 24 ghante ke bheetar floor test kii maang kii
 Said to be video recording and floor test with open ballot
 abhishek manu singhvi ensipi kii taraf se bahes kar rahe the
 He said if anyone is saying that he is with Ajit Pawar
 rajyapal ne bina kavring letters ke manzur kar liya
 This is a fraud with democracy
 tushaar mehta kaa sawaal vahiin tikaa tha ki kya rajyapal ko court aadesh de saktaa he, kya rajyapal ko protem spikar niyukt karne ke aadesh die ja sakate hai
 It is the right of the Governor to fix the time of floor test
 agar sarkaar ke paas samarthan he to vah floor test se kyon batch rahi he, kyon uski taraf se floor test kii samay seemaa par kuch nahin kaha ja rahaa he
 The Supreme Court's decision will come on Tuesday but a major decision in Ajit Pawar's case came only on Monday
 kya ajit pavaar ko anti karpshan beuro ne 9 maamle main clin chit di he
 DG of Anti Corruption Bureau Paramveer Singh has said that 3000 tenders related to irrigation scam are under investigation
 ye wo 9 tender ke maamle hai jinamein criminal cese nahin he
 They have been closed
 28 november ko hoicourt ko apadet report deni he
 There is information about which nothing was found
 baaki maamle chalate rahenge
 This is cleanliness
 thik ek saal pehle isi anti karpshan beuro ne hoicourt main halafanama diya tha ki ajit pavaar or anya adhikari doshi lagate hai
 24 firs have been registered against officers and contractors
 ajit pavaar kii bhoomika kii jaanch ho rahi he
 In September 2012, Ajit Pawar had to resign from the post due to these allegations of corruption
 to kya nachurli karpt party ab natural tareeke se karact hone lagi he
 The ED is investigating the 25000-crore scam in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank case against Ajit Pawar
 police kii aarthik aparaadh shakha ne exiaar darj karai he
 He is now the Deputy Chief Minister
 unhen pradhanmantri modi ne up mukhyamantri banane par badhai di he
 The Prime Minister was in Daltonganj, Jharkhand on Monday

 co / rfvkdtlvg2 — Bigg Boss (@biggboss) November 8, 2016 vah sirf chah maheene kaa tha 
 Was suffering from hunger for two hours
 aakhirkaar uski saansen tham gayi
 Do you know why? Because his mother did not get permission to feed the baby
 ye ghatana isi saat farvari kii he
 In Hatnur, Telangana, a woman laborer kept adding her hands and feet to feed the child for two hours
 mahila construction site ke paas hi rahati thi
 Even then the site engineer did not allow the woman to go
 duusari ghatana jaipur main rajasthan vidhansabha kii he
 When Raisingh Nagar MLA Sonadevi of Sriganganagar arrived here with his three-month-old daughter, the security guard stopped him at the gate
 unhen sadan kii kaarywahi main bhaag lenaa tha
 The guard kept citing the rules and Sonadevi remained adamant
 thak haar kar guard ne unhen bacchee ko saath lekar jane diya
 That woman laborer of Mehboob Nagar could not fight like Sonadevi
 haa, vah chaahati to kaam chhod kar ja sakati thi or aisa karne se uski god suuni hone se batch sakati thi
 But she could not do it
 use dar hoga ki kaam chhot jayega to paise milane band ho jaaenge
 Then how will she be able to nurture her child further? Is she not allowed to feed because she is a female laborer? And was Sonadevi able to take her daughter in because she is an MLA? This is the reality, but let's move away from it, both have one thing in common - both are mothers
 sari baton se itar donon ko baraabar kaa haq ye he ki unhen bachche ko doodh pilaane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 However, a case has been registered against that site engineer under section 304 of IPC
 duniya bhar main kaamkaaji mahilaon ke liye bacchon kii dekhbhaal badi chunauti rahi he
 The worst case is that of working class women, for whom neither crèche is available nor can they take time off work and feed their newborns
 nateeja ye hota he ki zyaadaatar bachche yaa to kuposhan ke shikaar ho jate hai or kai baar to aise haadason ke shikaar ho jate hai
 Sonadevi has demanded to create a crèche for infants in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly
 britain kii sansad kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he, vahaan 40 bacchon kii kshamta vaala cretch he
 Similarly, in the Parliament of Scotland, there are crèches for the children of visitors
 bharat main bhi aisi koshish hui he
 Renuka Chaudhary, who was the Union Minister in 2006, wrote to the then Speaker Somnath Chaudhary to create a crèche for children in Parliament
 spikar ne isaki ijaajat bhi de di lekin suraksha kaarnon se maamla atak gaya
 And it is still hanging
 aise samay, jab desh kii raajnneeti main ek chuttee ko lekar bavaal machaa ho, ek vidhayak ne kaam par aane ke liye ek choti si maang rakhi he phir bhi usko lekar gambhir nahin dikh rahaa
 According to the report, Women and Child Development Minister Anita Bhadel says that there is no consideration of the system of crèches in the assembly
 renuka choudhary or sonadevi ne jo kadam uthaae hai usamen us mahila majdoor kii awaz or uske bachche kii bhi chikhen bhi shaamil hai - unhen sunanaa hi padegaa

 is baat kaa khulaasa usase poochtacha ke dauraan hua he
 The NIA team has been constantly asking SP Salwinder Singh of Gurdaspur
 isi dauraan sutron ne bataaya ki salwinder ko aatankwaadiyon kii pahchaan nahin thi
 He felt that the terrorists were part of the drug syndicate and so he went there to help them cross the border
 salwinder ke kai phone numberon kii pahchaan hui he
 According to sources, from the CDR of SP Salvinder Singh of Gurdaspur, the NIA has identified several numbers which are related to drug smuggling
 salwinder inhen mubir bataa rahe hai lekin enie is angel se jaanch kar rahi he ki ye number drug taskaron ke hai or us din salwinder vahaan drug taskaron kii ghuspaith or unhen aage badhaane ke liye maujuud the
 It is believed that SP Salvinder Singh was fully involved with the case
 or vah niyamit rup se drug mafiaon kii madad karata aa rahaa tha
 During the incident, SP Salivander had called his superiors and informed them about the fact of the terrorists
 lekin salwinder kii kharaab chhavi kii vajah se adhikariyon ne der se ection liya
 Due to that delay of the officials, there was a big loss
 or is gambhir chook ke parinamswaroop bharat ko ek bade hamale kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Salivander was already under suspicion - SP Salvinder Singh said the number of terrorists was four-five, while his friend told four
 - ek taxi driver kii hatya karne vaale aatankiyon ne espi or unke saathiyon ko bina gambhir nuksaan pahunchaae kaise chhod diya
 - Why did the SP leave without a weapon and police team in a sensitive place like Pathankot
 espi ne kaha tha- peedit hum, sandigdh nahin espi salwinder singh ne bataaya tha vah khud peedit he, sandigdh nahin
 He had serious injuries
 pathankot ke coliaan mode par sandigdhon ne gaadi roki thi
 His friend Rajesh Verma was driving the vehicle
 usee samay achaanak aatanki unki gaadi main ghus gaye
 He asked to turn off the light inside
 unhen peeche dhakel diya
 His hands were tied behind the seat
 un sabhi ko gan point par le rakhaa tha
 The incident happened while returning from the dargah, he said that the terrorists did not know that they were in the police officer's car
 agava kiye jane ke kareeb 30-40 minute baad punjab police kii check post paar karte hi aatankiyon ne sabase pehle unako gaadi se gira diya
 He was unconscious at that time
 hosh main aane ke baad unhone police control room ko aatankiyon kii jaankaree di, lekin police unki jaankaree par yakeen nahin hua
 He was coming back after offering prayers at the dargah
 kabhi udyog nagari ke naam se pukaara jane vaala kota shahar ab desh main shiksha yaa koching nagari ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Students coming from outside for Shihna have changed the outline of the city itself
 yahi vajah he ki ab yahaan multistory building kaa chalan teji se badhata ja rahaa he
 In the last one and a half decade, the trend of buying multistory buildings and flats in Kota has increased rapidly
 aaj yahaan multistories main 15 se 90 lakh ru
 Flats up to available

 Kota has a maximum of 10 storey buildings built or under construction
 sabase oonchi or puraani multistory mahalakshmi anchlev he
 "it was the largest group housing colony in Rajasthan when flats were built in 2006," says Satyendrapal Singh, director of Vastuvedic Colonizers & Developers, who built the Mahalaxmi Enclave with 516 flats
 ”mahalakshmi enklev main rahane vaale harsinder paal saahani bataate hai, ''akele ghar ko aap suunaa chhodkar nahin ja sakate
 But here you can roam out for any number of days with a lock
 yahaan maahaul dostana he
 "skyscrapers being built here have all facilities like swimming pool, yoga center, badminton court to community hall
" pani, bijli, suraksha jaisi kai moolbhoot suvidhaon kii vajah se kota main multistory flats samskruti badhati ja rahi he
 There are also around 800 flats in the nine-storey Mahalakshmipuram opposite Mahalaxmi Enclave
 comshyal buildingon main sabase oonchi city kol paanch manjila building he, jo 18 meter oonchai tak bani he or puri tarah aabaad he

 The builders and the people who build flats in Multistory all describe these flats as economical and better
 kota main is samay aath-nau manjila imaaraton main kareeb 3,000 flats kaa nirmaan chal rahaa he
 These are said to have cost Rs 2,000 crore
 se zyada kaa nivesh hua he
 If we look at the residents from here, then in the era of security, peace and inflation, a multistory flats society is becoming a way to tie economy and disintegrating society together
 in sab phaaydon se kharidaar bhi santusht hai or bilders tathaa developers kii bhi pau baarah
 The City Development Trust is building three to four-storey flats for low-income people

 As a result, the opposition stuck to its amendment on the proposal and the government lost
 parampara he ki vipaksh dhanyavad prastaav par die gaye apane sanshodhan waapas le letaa he lekin mangalvaar ko sipiem ke seetaram yechuri jis tarah se sanshodhan par ade or unhone jis tarah sadan main sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu se kaha ki 'saamaanya paristhitiyon main main aapaki baat maan letaa lekin abhi mere paas koi auki rasta nahin he' usase saaf lagata he ki sarkaar vipaksh ko saath lene kii apni kootneeti main fail ho gai
 Prime Minister Modi responded to the debate on the motion of thanks after a long debate that lasted for nearly 12 hours and made sharp attacks on the opposition
 lekin sarkaar ke floor manager vipaksh ko uski ahmiyat kaa ehsaas karaane or unke saath talmail banane main fail dikhe
 The government forgot that the opposition has proposed amendments and the government is in a minority in the House
 vipaksh ke netaa yechuri ne 'bhrashtachar rokane or kaale dhan ko waapas laane main sarkaar kii naakaami' par apana sanshodhan baari bahumat se paas kara liya
 When Yechury started insisting on this amendment to vote, the government was shocked
 sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne pehle yechuri se maang kii ki vah apana sanshodhan waapas len phir vah vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi azaad se madad kii guhaar karte dikhe
 The government had the last hope that the Congress might support it at the time of voting but when Venkaiah was seeking help from Ghulam Nabi, he was seen smiling and expressing his compulsion

 Usually the Prime Minister sits down to listen to the big leaders but it is up to the speaker whether he is sitting or not
 vipakshi netaa seetaram yechuri ne baad main enditivi india se kaha, 'vah hamaare purvajon par tippanee kar rahe the

 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke vidhayak bukkal nawab (bukkal Nawab) ne hanuman ji ko musalmaan bataa diya
 Bukkal Nawab said that Hanuman ji was a Muslim
 bukkal nawab kaa kahana he ki hanuman ji musalmaan the, isliye musalamaanon main jo naam rakhe jate hai - rahamaan, ramadan, farmaan, zeeshaan, qurbaan - jitne bhi naam rakhe jate he, ve kareeb-kareeb unheen par rakhe jate hai
 'bukkal Nawab says that there are about 100 such names, which are based on Hanumanji itself
 hindu bhai hanuman ji naam rakh lengen, lekin sultan nahin milegaa, armaan, rahamaan, ramajaan nahin rakh sakate
 Bukkal Nawab's statement on Hanuman ji has intensified the politics
 vipaksh ne is mudde par sarkaar ko gherna shuru kar diya he
 Congress said that BJP people should first decide whether Hanuman ji is there? Congress spokesperson Onkar Singh said that BJP does politics to divide the society and the latest statement by Bukkal Nawab is about to divide the society
 samaaj ko jatiyon, dharmo main baantne kii raajnneeti yahi log karte hai
 At the same time, MLC of Congress Deepak Singh said, 'BJP should first decide what is the caste of Hanumanji? We only know that Hanumanji is the favored deity of all
 vah pavansuta hanuman hai or vah hameshaa se ham sabhi ke isht the or rahenge
 Samajwadi Party MLC Rajpal Kashyap said that the Chief Minister, the minister, all are engaged in revealing the caste of Hanumanji
 mukhyamantri hanuman ko dalit bataate hai to unke ek mantri jat bataate hai
 At the same time, now Bukkal Nawab is calling him a Muslim
 ab to sarkaar main hi ekajutata nahin dikh rahi he
 Let me tell you that earlier, while addressing a rally in Alwar, Rajasthan, during the campaign for the assembly elections in five states, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had called Lord Bajrangbali i
e
 Hanuman ji as a Dalit
 siem yogi adityanath ne kaha tha ki hanuman ji dalit or vanchit hai
 Yogi Adityanath had said that 'bajrangbali is such a folk deity who is a forest dweller himself, an exile, a Dalit, a deprived
 bhartiya samudaay ko uttar se lekar dakshin tak purab se pashchim tak sabko jodne kaa kaam bajrangbali karte hai
 ' # WATCH: BJP MLC Bukkal Nawab says "hamara man'na hai Hanuman ji Muslaman theyy, isliye Musalmanon ke andar jo naam rakha jata hai Rehman, Ramzan, Farman, Zishan, Qurban jitne bhi naam rakhe jaate hain wo karib kheib unhi park jaate hain

 The Supreme Court has given big relief to BSP supremo Mayawati in the disproportionate assets case
 supreme court ne mayawati ke khilaaf sibiai kii arji ko khaarij kar diya he
 The court has said that it is not proper to run criminal proceedings against Mayawati in this case
 supreme court ne sibiai par talkh tippanee karte hue kaha he ki uski jaanch kaa tarika thik nahin he
 He rejected the cbi's plea
 court ne 9 saal puraane aay se adhik sampatti maamle ko khaarij kar diya
 The court also pulled up the CBI for starting an investigation against Mayawati without clear instructions from the court
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara apanaaya gaya tarika ‘gairajaruri’ tha or agency ne taj karidor ghotaale main adaalat ke adeshon ko sahi dhang se samajhe bina hi unke khilaaf kaarywahi kii
 a bench headed by Justice p Sathasivam clarified the Supreme Court order to initiate an inquiry against the state government officials in the scam and said that a separate FIR against Mayawati in the case of alleged excess wealth from known sources of income No order to enter was given
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki sibiai kii sitambar 2008 kii sthiti report main is tarah kaa koi nishkarsh nahin he ki mayawati ne 1995 se 2003 ke dauraan aay se kathith rup se adhik sampatti arjeet kii
 In the context of the status report of the CBI, the bench said that there is no concrete report against the petitioner (mayawati) in the disproportionate assets case in the Taj Corridor scam
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki uskaa 2002 kaa aadesh vishesh taur par taj karidor ghotaale se sambandhit tha or mayawati ke khilaaf praathmiki darj karne ko lekar koi nirdesh nahin diye gayi the, jaisaa ki sibiai ne kiya
 The bench read the judgment and said that no instructions were given to register a separate FIR against Mayawati under the Prevention of Corruption Act
 peeth ne kaha, ‘sibiai ne hamaare adeshon ko sahi dhang se samajhe bina kaarywahi kii
 He said that the method adopted by the CBI was unnecessary
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki jaanch agency ne uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti maamla darj karke apane kshetradhikaar ko badhaayaa jabaki nyaayalay kii ore se is tarah kaa koi nirdesh nahin diya gaya tha
 The bench said, "the CBI should have lodged only one FIR (in the Taj Corridor case)
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne (mayawati ke khilaaf) duusari praathmiki darj karne kaa koi nirdesh nahin diya tha
 The apex court has ruled Mayawati's plea seeking quashing of the proceedings against her in the disproportionate assets case filed by the CBI
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke khilaaf maamla chalaakar agency kaa raajnneetik aujaar ke taur par upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Mayawati had approached the apex court in May 2008 and demanded dismissal of criminal proceedings against her in a disproportionate assets case filed by the CBI nine years ago
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki yah unke khilaaf raajnneetik dushmani ke tahat uthaaya gaya kadam he
 The court reserved its order on May 1 this year after hearing both sides
 faisle par pratikriya vyakt karte hue bispi netaa satish chandra mishra ne ise aitihaasik nirnay qaraar diya he
 He said that we have got justice after 9 years
 uttar pradesh congress ke pravaktaa akhilesh prasad singh ne kaha ki mayawati ke khilaaf agar supreme court ne faisla suna diya he, to isamen min-mekh nikaalane kii koi jarurat nahin rah jaati he
 He said that the court would have given a verdict based on witnesses and evidence
 mayawati ne 2008 main centre sarkaar or sibiai ke khilaaf yachika daayar kar guhaar lagaai thi ki unke khilaaf aay se zyada sampatti ke maamle radd kiya jaae
 On the other hand, the CBI says that it has enough evidence to prosecute Mayawati
 isi aadhaar par sibiai mayawati kii yachika kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Mayawati had said that the bench should direct the CBI to take into account the order passed by the Income Tax Tribunal in which the tribunal had stated that their income is genuine
 unhone kaha tha ki dilli ucch nyaayalay ne bhi isi aadesh ko barkaraar rakhaa
 The CBI had alleged that there was 'sufficient evidence' to prove that he had acquired more assets from known sources of his income
 mayawati ne daawa kiya tha ki unhen party ke kaaryakartaaon se daan ke rup main yah dhan mila tha
 Questioning Mayawati's assets, the CBI alleged that her declared assets in the year 2003 were Rs 1 crore, which increased to Rs 50 crore in 2007
 sibiai ne 13 sitambar 2011 ko daayar apane antim halafname main aarope lagaaya tha ki mayawati or unke rishtedaaron ke bich ‘aapraadhik gathjod’ he or unke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti maamla iskar vibhaag ke nishkashren ke aadhaar par band nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The investigating agency also rejected Mayawati's plea that the disproportionate assets case should be closed after the income tax authorities accepted her income tax assessment

 com / ne3oenvq8o darasal, peedit mahila ne thane main padosi ke khilaaf marpet kii ek exiaar darj kara rakhi thi
 On the other hand, some members of the woman's family were also named in the case
 sab inspector dhirendra kumaar singh ko mahila ke cese kaa investegating officer banaaya gaya
 In the initial phase everything was fine, but gradually the color of Daroga ji started changing
 wo cese ke bahaane kol to karte the, lekin cese se sambandhit koi baat nahin karte the
 Often, the doctor would talk only after going through the case
 jo unhen kaaphi mahangaa padaa
 On the orders of SSP, they are now investigating the draft of this whole episode
 is maamle main mahila se bhi poochtacha kii gai he
 The woman is a resident of Rahmatganj locality of Chadhi station
 mulaayam singh yadav ne vah kah diya jo koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 He said that he wants Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister again
 mulaayam ne yah baat solahavin loksabhaa ke vidaai bhaashan main kahi
 One such thing which is echoed in the ears of BJP leaders like a melodious tone, while in the ears of the Opposition it is like a hoarse raga
 yah aisi baat he jo sapa-basapa gathbandhan se tagdi chunauti jhel rahi bijepi uttar pradesh main ek brahastra kii tarah istemaal kar sakati he
 Especially to confuse the Yadav voters on whom Shivpal Singh Yadav is already ready to cast his vote
 mulaayam ke bayaan ke raajnneetik nihitarth ke bare main aage baat karenge, lekin pehle aaie sun lete hai unhone kya kya kaha
 When Mulayam said this, Sonia Gandhi was sitting with him
 udhar bijepi netaaon ne ise haathon-haath liya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself mentioned Mulayam Singh Yadav's blessings several times in his speech
 shaayad isliye taaki jin tak mulaayam kii baat nahin pahunchi ho un tak pahunch jaae
 Mulayam's blessing to Modi has come at a time when Akhilesh Yadav is becoming very aggressive in UP
 kal hi unhen elahabaad jane se roka gaya or uske virodh main rajya bhar main sapa kaaryakartaaon ne virodh pradarshan kiye
 Mulayam's statement has also come at a time when opposition leaders gathered at Delhi's Jantar Mantar
 basapa or areldi ke saath sapa kaa siton kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa he
 Seats have also been identified
 thik aise samay mulaayam kaa yah bayaan unke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 There have been talks about the deteriorating relationship between father and son
 vidhansabha chunaav ke samay bhi akhilesh yadav kaa adhyaksh bananaa unke or mulaayam ke bich khatpat kaa kaaran bana tha
 Uncle Shivpal's displeasure and now taking a different route is also the result of this pit
 shivpal alag party bana chuke hai
 They will put emphasis on those seats which have come on the part of Samajwadi Party
 unamem se kai siton par yadav vot nirnaayak hai
 The BJP can benefit directly from the sharing of these Yadav votes between Shivpal and Akhilesh
 pita-putr main vivaad kii ek vajah sapa-basapa samjhauta bhi ho saktaa he
 On the way to make Mayawati the Prime Minister, Akhilesh Yadav said that you know my choice and the Prime Minister will be from Uttar Pradesh, that too, Mulayam's close friends have not liked it
 in tamaam kaarnon se mulaayam singh yadav kaa bayaan behad dilachasp ho jaataa he

 dilli ke barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar ke sidicand maamle main ek nayaa twist aa gaya he
 The woman who made serious allegations against Sandeep Kumar has suddenly disappeared
 us mahila ko ajtak ne dhundh nikaala tha, uskaa parivaar tuutane kii kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 But where that woman is now, no one knows
 ghar chhodkar chali gai mahilasoshal media par sandip kumaar or mahila kashleel videoviral hone ke baad se vah mahila samaaj se munh chhipate gum rahi thi
 The objective of the news of Aaj Tak was to bring the reality which is hidden from the world till now
 jab ajtak kii team mahila se milane pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki vah apana ghar chhodkar kahin or ja chuki he
 His family is not willing to talk to anyone
 mahila kii shikaayat par hui thi sandip kii giraftaardilli ajtak kii team ne ek enjio kii madad se us mahila ko dhund nikaala tha
 Then based on his statement, former Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar was also arrested
 31 agast ko sandip kumaar kii sidi saamne ai thi
 After which there was a stir in the political corridors
 anaan-fanan main kejariwal ne sandip kumaar ko mantri pad se hataa diya tha
 Despite the opposition's attack, many AAP leaders were seen to support Sandeep by calling it a private matter
 lekin bada sawaal ye tha kii aakhir ye sidi kab kii he or koun he wo mahila jo us video main dikh rahi he
 After all, in which circumstances this video was made
 ashleel video ho rahaa tha viralais sawaal kaa jawaab yaa to sandip kumaar ke paas tha yaa phir us mahila ke paas
 But who was the woman and said? No one had the answer to this question
 raajnneetik partiyaan aarope-pratyarope main lageen thi
 In such a situation, the team of Aaj Tak pledged to bring the truth of the video to the public
 ye ek behad mushkil kaam tha
 Nobody wanted to talk on the matter
 sandip kumaar kii giraftaar kii maang bhi zoron par thi
 Nobody knew about Paramhila
 video har jagah viral ho rahaa tha
 Aaj Tak's team was looking for a woman
 video main dikh rahi mahila kii talashis dauraan sandip kumaar ke charitra par ungali uthaane vaale bhi saamne aae
 One of them was Lokendra Rana
 jo kabhi mantri kaa campan manager tha
 His accusation was that Sandeep had already treated women in an indecent manner
 isi dauraan ajtak kii team ko kamyaabi mili
 Aaj Tak's team with an NGO reached out to women
 mahila ne ajtak ko bataaya ki vah sandip kumaar se rashan card banavaane ke silsile main milane gai thi
 At the same time, he was drunk and drank everything with him
 use video ke bare main bhi koi jaankaree nahin thi
 When the Aaj Tak team questioned the woman, why did you not complain? So the woman said that she was scared
 kyonki vah garib mahila he or mantri ke khilaaf shikaayat karne se dar rahi thi
 But coming with the NGO gave him a boost and he filed a complaint in the case
 mahila se poocha gaya ki kya wo sandip ko pehle se jaanati thi
 So he said no
 vah ilaake kaa emele hone ke naate unke paas kaam ke liye gai thi
 But she did not know that her honor would be bargained in the name of making ration cards
 enjio ko mili thi dhamkiastak se baatcheet ke baad mahila ne enjio kii madad se exiar darj karwaai thi
 After which the police had registered a case against Sandeep Kumar under Section 376 of the IPC and IT Act
 thik iske baad sandip kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 The entire matter is now before the court but after this the NGO who brought the complainant woman was threatened
 kisi anjaan shaks ne enjio ko phone karke kaha ki unhone jo kiya he vah galat kiya he
 The consequences of this will not be right
 or ab mahila apana ghar chhodkar kahin chali gai

 com / c3dz9pdoky Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday surrounded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP on the issue of nationalism, saying that bjp's government was sent to Kandahar by the jaish-e-mohammad's global terrorist, Masood Azhar, from the jail in India and not the Congress government
 has
 gwalior loksabhaa seat ke liye party pratyaashee ashok singh ke liye prachaar karne aae rahul ne jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘main rashtrawaad kii baat karata hum
 i want to ask him (BJP and PM Modi), who is the terrorist, Masood Azhar, was sent to him by the Pakistan Congress Party? ”he further said,“ Was the Congress party sent this by sitting in an airplane? Was our minister sitting in an airplane? Did our minister give money to the terrorist organization? ”rahul said,‘ No
 bijepi kii sarkaar ne hindustan kii jail se us aatankwaadi ko nikaala, hawaii jahaaj main daalaa, bijepi kaa mantri us hawaii jahaaj main baitha or jaish e mohammad ko paisa bijepi ke mantri ne diya
 "the Congress President said," and the same terrorist killed CRPF personnel in Pulwama
 narendra modi ji ko jawaab dena chahie
 Who did this (to leave terrorist Masood Azhar)? ye kaam narendra modi ji or bijepi ne kiya
 Why don't they tell the country? nahin bol sakate
 Can not speak, because this is the truth
 narendra modi sachai bolnaa nahin jaanate
 'rahul said,' Modi should have said that you trusted me, brothers and sisters
 maine kaha tha do karod yuvaaon ko rojgaar duungaa, nahin kar paaya
 It was a mistake
 maafee maang leni thi or (kahana tha) is baar main (modi) aisa karke dikhaa duungaa
 "he said," If Narendra Modi had spoken the truth in this election, he would have said that yes, i had made false promises, i had made a mistake, then the Hindustan who had trusted him, who has broken, might have survived a little bit
 magar narendra modi sochate hai ki hindustan kii janata ko koi samaj nahin
 Think that whatever comes in the heart, do it
 nahin, modi ji ye desh garib jarur he magar yah desh bahut hoshiyaar he
 This country recognizes the truth, understands it and has made up its mind to defeat Narendra Modi this time
