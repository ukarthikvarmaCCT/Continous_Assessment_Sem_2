 australia ke khilaaf test siries main mili sharmnaak haar kii hataasha ko bhuulakar captain mahendra singh dhoni bhul kar aage badhane kii baat kii he
 Faced with criticism for his ineffective captaincy and poor performance in Test cricket, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has offered that he is ready to give up the long-form captaincy of the game if the BCCI feels there is a better option
 dhoni ne kaha ki agar test main koi unase behatar kaam kar saktaa he to team ke hit main captaini chhodane main unhen khushi hogi
 Prior to the Twenty20 match against Australia on Wednesday, Dhoni said, 'captaincy is not for any one
 ek pad mere paas he or yah atirikt jimmedaari he
 As long as i am doing this responsibility, i want to do well in this work but it is not that i want to stick to it
 agar behatar vikalp maujuud he to vah aa saktaa he
 'he said,' In the end you want India to perform well
 agar koi is kaam ko behatar anjaam de saktaa he to captaini use saunp di jaani chahie
 'dhoni's role as a wicket-keeper batsman and captain in the Test team is beginning to be questioned
 team ko unki captaini main videshi sarajameen par lagaataar saat maichon main shikast jhelni padi jabaki vah ballebaaji main bhi naakaam rahe
 In England, he scored 31 in four Tests
 43 kii ausat se 220 ran banaae jabaki austrailia main dhoni teen test kii chah pariyon main 20
 Was able to score only 102 runs at an average of 40
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘mujhe saadhe teen saal pehle yah jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 i am trying to play this role, move forward with the team and perform well
 ’ bhartiya captain ne isse pehle test shrinkhalaa ke dauraan sanket diye the ki 2015 vishwa cap tak uplabdh rahane ke liye 2013 tak vah test cricket ko puri tarah chhod sakate hai
 Dhoni said, 'there are two years till 2013
 mujhe nahin pataa ki main tab tak main jidaan rahoonga yaa nahin
 Playing in IPL, Champions League and consecutive series
 aap kaarykram or kaaphi aaraam ko lekar pehle hi faisla nahin kar sakate
 'he said,' i have to decide by 2013 but it is still two years
 main 2014 main yah nahin kah saktaa ki main aglaa vishwa cap nahin khel rahaa or duusare khilaadi ko khud ko sabit karne ke liye sirf 25 ke aasapaas match duun
 Dhoni, however, clarified that his career as a Test cricketer is not over, but believes that the decision is not entirely in his hands
 unhone kaha, ‘main ab bhi apni yatra par aage bad rahaa hum
 i have not reached any end
 lekin yah faisla koi khilaadi khud nahin karata, anya log yah faisla karata hai ki aap laayak hai yaa nahin
 The Indian captain said, "as a player i am giving my 100 percent
 main ab bhi vah kar rahaa hum jo pehle karata tha
 Test cricket is real cricket
 lekin main anya praroopon ko kamatar nahin kar rahaa
 All formats have their own challenges
 ’ dhoni ne kaha ki dressing room kaa maahaul yuvaaon ke shor se chahak rahaa he jabaki senior khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi ke dauraan yah kaaphi shant or gambhir tha
 He said, 'our ODI team looks completely different
 yah kaaphi adhik shor karti he or dressing room main jajba banaae rakhti he
 People pull each other's legs and liveliness prevails
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah aisa he jaise aap kishor kumaar se sheen paal kii duniya main aa gaye ho
 This is the kind of difference
 ’ dhoni ne naam liye bagaiyr team main senior khilaadiyon kii ahmiyat par jor diya or kaha ki test main kharaab pradarshan ke baad aalochana gairajaruri he
 He said, "age is just a number
 agar khilaadi ran bananaa jari rakhenge to koi is bare main baat nahin karegaa
 When you don't make runs, everything will come out, how fast you run, how fast you turn during running, but we are not worried about it
 ’ dhoni ne agle kuch hafton main hone vaale simit overon ke maichon main team ke behatar pradarshan kii ummid jataai

 When Pathan got down to bat, the Indian team had lost six wickets on the score of 74 runs, their eight sixes and so four innings, India was moving towards creating history but all hopes were lost as soon as they returned to the pavilion

 Earlier, the three-test series was also drawn 1–1
 bharat ne barish ke brake ke baad dakshin africa ke 24 ran ke andar chah wicket chatka diye the lekin mejabaan team ne hashim amala ke naabad 116 ran kii badaulat nau wicket ganvaakar 250 ran banaaye
 The Indian top order also collapsed like cards this time with most of the batsmen being dismissed due to poor shots against South Africa's disciplined bowling
 12wein over main aadhi bhartiya team 60 ran par pavilion laut chuki thi or lag rahaa tha ki team 100 ran ke andar hi simat jaayegi
 Pathan again took an aggressive stand and scored his second ODI century in 68 balls

 It seemed at one time that Pathan would be able to win India the match by repeating the same feat as he did after scoring an unbeaten 123 against New Zealand in Bangalore last month

 'man of the Match' Amla once again became a problem for the Indian team, who helped South Africa to a respectable score by scoring another century
 amala ne apane 42wein match main saatvaan vanade shatak puraa kiya
 Interestingly, Amla started the Test series before the ODI with a hundred and now the last match of the ODI series also ended with a century and he has scored both centuries in this stadium
 amala ne 113 gend main nau chauke lagaakar 100 ran banaaye jisamen ek or do ran kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa
 He completed his century with a four off Suresh Raina towards third man

 India's fast bowling pair of Munaf Patel (3 for 50) and Zaheer (2 for 47) bowled well in the final overs after the match was bowled out for 46 overs due to rain
 dakshin africa ne barish aane se pehle 42 over main teen wicket par 226 ran bana liye the
 But later he lost six wickets and scored 250 for nine in his innings

 Earlier, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to bowl by winning the toss on a pitch which did not help the fast bowlers
 piyush chawla ko ashish nehra kii jagah antim ekadash main shaamil kiya gaya
 The Indians got off to a good start with the help of veteran fast bowler Zaheer Khan, who picked up Graeme Smith (7) who caught Yusuf Pathan in the second slip as he touched the ball off the off stump
 lekin tisare number ke ballebaaj vaan vik ne amala ko acha sahyog diya jinhone kharaab gend par shaat jamaaye or saath hi wicket ke bich ek do ran bhi banaaye
 Sensing the pitch, Dhoni used six spinners but Chawla, who was included in the World Cup squad, could not impress
 yuvaraj singh (45 ran dekar do wicket) ke alaava koi bhi spin gendbaaj prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kar sakaa 
 Yuvraj sent Van Wyk and AB de Villiers (11) to the pavilion

 chandigarh shatabdi aisi pehali train hogi, jisamen 'anubhuti' dibbe lagenge, jo is shrenee main safar karne waalon kii yatra ko bahut aaraamdeh or suhana banayega
 This is a special air-conditioned luxury class compartment, which has been announced in the Rail Budget this year

 achche-acchon ko ausat kaa niyam nahin bakhshata
 It also seems to have captured the uniquely named star Todayj Chanakya in the election poll business
 isane chunaavon kii bilkul sahi-sahi, baj dfa to dashamalav ke aakhri bindu tak sateek bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye khaasi pratishtha hasil kii he
 Its most golden moment was when it predicted 340 seats for the NDA in last summer's general election
 ab lagaataar do baar isaki bhavishyavaaniyan galat nikali hai
 In both the states of Maharashtra and Jharkhand, it was predicted that the almighty BJP would win a big victory, but it turned out that in both the places it won but the first victory was incomplete, then it could touch the victory in the latest elections
 chunaav surveykshan main chanakya share bazaar ke big bul kii tarah he or iske anumaan bahari paryvekshak jaise rahe hai
 Until now, the reason for its success was simple
 modi / bijepi kii lahar chal rahi thi, isliye baahar se bhavishyavaanee karnaa surakshit tha
 Like all waves, now that this wave is also down - not yet reversed - then straightforward old algebra does not work
 kul milakar,modi kii bijepico ek or chunavi fatah ke shrey se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 His political Ashwamedha Yajna appears as unchallenged in the Kali Yuga as Lord Rama was in the virtuous Treta Yuga
 usne ek or rajya apni jheli main daal liya he
 More importantly, it is a seriously troubled and exceptionally likely state of Jharkhand, which never gave a majority mandate in its 14 years of existence
 lekin bijepi kii kul siten bataati hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main usne jin 56 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat hasil kii thi, unamem se takreeban 20 ganvaa die hai
 The party could not even conquer Kashmir and failed to live up to the blatant claim of its 'mission 44'
 lekin vahaan vah sabase badi rashtriya party ke rup main congress ko bedakhal karne main kaamyaab rahi or yah bhi pakkaa kar diya ki party kaa patan akhil-rashtriya or saath hi secular bhi he
 Why are we still complaining? The winds are still blowing in favor of the BJP, but Maharashtra and Jharkhand are the first signs of a slow (though far from reversing) pace
 maharashtra main party bahumat se kaaphi dur rah gai, jisase shivasena ko patkhni dene kaa uskaa daanv naakaam ho gaya
 He got a minor majority in Jharkhand
 donon hi nattejey uske paariwarik kautilya yaa chunaav surveykshak chanakya ke vaade se kaaphi kam the
 In Kashmir too, its 3 per cent vote and the forfeiture of the bail of all the candidates except one testifies the truth
 agar aap in nateezon ko bihar, uttar pradesh or rajasthan ke upachunaavon main mili paraajay se jodakar dekhen, to puri tasviir dekh paaenge
 The period when Modi's name was enough to win the election, especially clear from the example of Haryana, is about to go
 ek or baarik baat modi sareekhe kushagra shaks kii najar se nahin chhip sakthih sabhi aasaan jeet un rajyon tak simit hai jahaan congress ke saath sidhaa muqabla he
 From JMM to PDP / NC and RJD / JD (U) / SP, all the other players are able to protect their areas much better
 chunavi raajnneeti kaa may 2014 ke baad kaa ‘lamp post’ daur khatm ho rahaa he
 Modi and BJP will have to return to the political clique of the old fashion
 rajya netaaon ko khadaa karnaa hoga
 The strategy of rejecting the old allies will have to be reconsidered
 sabase mahatvapurn, raajnneeti or sarkaar ko unheen puraani patariyon par waapas laana hoga—sushasan, aarthik vruddhi, vikaas kii patariyon par—jin par chadhakar ve satta main aae the
 India Today headlines 2014 Narendra Modi is full of many unique features
 dashakon main ve hamaare sabase prabhavi rajnatik vaktaa hai, yahaan tak ki vaajapeyi se bhi behatar
 He is our first fully self-made true national leader
 lekin isse bhi zyada mahatv kii baat yah ki ve media (paaramparik, soshal or anti-soshal) kii takat, baton ko ghumaane kii upyogita or jan dharna kii ahmiyat ko hamaare itihaas kii kisi bhi duusari saarvajanik hasti se behatar samajhate hai
 He is also at the peak of power
 to modi se meraa sawaal yah haih phir ve dusron ko, sahyogiyon ko bhi or virodhiyon ko bhi, apni surkhiyaan kyon hadapney de rahe hai? yah vah nuks he, jo raajnneeti ke sachche khilaadi main kabhi nahin paaya jaataa
 i am fully aware that i am writing this at a time when RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has come to Delhi on a three-day visit and this visit can be more important than any head of state
 mumkin he ki jo sawaal main uthaa rahaa hum, unamem kuch unke nagpur lautne (yaa jahaan bhi vah mahaj ek chrishchiyan new year kii shaam bitaane ke liye lautnaa pasand karen) se pehle hi tay ho jaaen
 But the fact is that the RSS and its associated organizations are today stealing the headlines of their Prime Minister himself
 unhone virodhiyon ko bhi in daraaron ke bheetar jhaankne kaa mauka de diya he
 Regardless of the loathsome idea of obstructing the work of Parliament as a strategy, the RSS, VHP and other organizations have given the opposition parties a new, secular high moral ground
 koi nahin jaanata ki hamaare vaidic vaigyanikon or vaidyon ke paas shav main dobaaraa praan foonkane kii kaabiliyat thi yaa nahin
 But as his successors, the Sangh Parivar's perpetrators are performing the miracle of reviving life on the same old, effective, but ridiculous nectar of secular unity among the equally lifeless opposition parties
 masalan, ghati ke mizaaj or siyasat ke jaankaar kehete hai ki modi kii barambar yatraaon or bhaashanon main jhalkati eemaandaaree ke liye unki khaasi saraahna hui thi; bijepi or bhi achche nattejey laati, basharte dharmantaran ko lekar nai surkhiyon kii andhadhundh utaavali ne or phir dimag se hataa paane main mushkil us ‘haramjaadon’ vaale bayaan ne maahaul ko is kadar bigaada nahin hota
 This makes it more attractive than any of the headlines in Clean India
 (khulassaah is stanbhakaar ko svachh bharat kaa doot manonith kiya gaya he or shrunkhlaa ko jari rakhane ke liye apni ore se usne nau logon kii suchi ghoshit kar di he
 ) Admit that i do not know Modi very well, but as much as i know, i can not believe that he would be happy in the mind of an event like this
 yaa yah sab bilkul unheen kii patakatha ke mutabik ho rahaa he, jaisaa ki ab unke virdohi kah rahe hai
 Modi is not Vajpayee and he never pretended to be a model
 unhone hindutv main apni aasthaa ko kabhi chipaaya nahin
 But he himself defines the concept of Rajdharma in its original way, while giving open leeway to the opinionated worshipers of ideology has never been a part of his plan
 gujarat main hindu pakshdhar sarkaar chalaane ke liye unki kaaphi aalochana kii jaati he, lekin agar aap purvaagrah se mukt hokar tathyon ko dekhen, to aresas or viechpi ko, khaskar praveen togdipha ko, aukaat main rakhane kaa unka shandaar record rahaa he
 Then why are they allowing this? Even for a second, i do not agree that Modi wants this; After all he is a committed volunteer, campaigner
 main sweekaar karata hum ki yah baat unke vichaar or style ke bare main meri samaj (jo naakaafi he) se mail nahin khaati
 These days, such self-portraits have to be used very carefully, but as Lutyens' old Delhi news, i accept that i cannot say what is true in my opinion: Can the RSS do all this with their silent consent Has been (most likely); Is he doing all this to prove to him, the workers and the world who the boss and elder brother are; Is it a conspiracy by the Togadians who dislike him in the family; Or is it the rss's own character, the RSS unable to improve? One thing you can say now is that this lazy explanation that it is just a sample of the idiots of marginalized insignificant people, cannot be embraced
 khaskar sarasanghachaalak ke bol chukne ke baad to katai nahin
 Because only a very adventurous or courageous person can say that Sarsanghchalak is an insignificant person of marginalization
 or main donon nahin hum
 Now that he has been six months in power and in the honeymoon phase of politics, this is the first decisive moment for Modi
 agar vah apni rajnatik or naitik puunji main aage bhi send lagane kii ijaajat dete hai, to agle do maheenon ke bheetar vah ek asli dhakka jhelane kaa jokhim uthaaenge
 Modi is so vicious that he will not get caught in the fact that fighting the Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party is as easy as dusting off the destitute Congress in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and now Kashmir
 dilli main kejariwal kaa dobaaraa majboot hokar ubharna naammumkin nahin he or agar aisa hua, to yah honeymoon kii samaapti kaa kshan ho saktaa he
 The RSS and its saints can then make as much headlines as they want, but they will slowly fade away from them with their government
 kya modi ko unase yah kehane kaa saahas he?punashchah raajnneeti ke dhoomadhadake se dur, adivasee jilon main ek or jansanhaar ke saath assam phir khabaron main laut aayaa
 Reporters will tell you how and why this tragedy happened, but a much larger political issue should be put forward: Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who is almost 80 years old, has had his heart operated since four years ago, since then there is really no one in Assam There is no government
 jo thodi-bahut pakad sarkaar kii thi bhi, aam chunaav main bijepi ke haroonges ubhaar ke baad vah chhot gai
 The Congress high command is responsible for this
 unhone gogoi ko bahut lambey vakt ke liye pad par bane rahane diya, loksabhaa chunaav main apane bete ko aage laane diya or mehnatee, mahatvakankshi or saadhan-sampann yuva netaa or ab purv swasthya mantri hemanth biswa sarama kii mahatvakankshaon ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 He had an heir raised on his home land, but left him to go to war with his government and party
 chandukhaane kii charchaa yah he ki hataash hokar sarama ne rahul gandhi se milane kii ichha jaahir kii or poocha ki unhen mukhyamantri banane kii apni mahatvakanksha puri karne ke liye aakhir kya karnaa padegaa? khaskar tab jab unki paidaaish kisi rajnatik gharaane main nahin hui he
 Looks like they have not figured out any answer yet, so are postponing
 ab meraa sawaal unase yah haih agar unhone sthaneey ovaisi, badaruddin ajmal ko muslim voton kaa thekedaar banaakar dhruvikrut assam ko vaaki bijepi ke haathon main saunpane kaa faisla kar hi liya he, to aisa karne main do saal kyon lagaate hai? abhaage rajya kii takalif ko fouran khatm kar dijie
 While talking to CNN, Amina Ahmed said that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, but hanging him is like hanging people from all over Iraq
 ameena kaa kahana he saddaam hossain iraq kaa raashtrapati tha
 It was not right to hang a President coming from another country like this

 Many of his family started crying during the execution
 nivene kaa kahana he saddaam hossain se uski parivaar ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya tha
 Saddam did many wrong things he should not have done, but a ruler like Saddam Hussein is needed to rule Iraq
 nivene kaa kahana he, “main or meraa parivaar muslim nahin balki isai he lekin saddaam hossain ne kisi ko yah ijazat nahin diya tha ki vah isai logon ko nuksaan pahunchaae lekin ab halaat karaab hai
 People of Christianity are being killed
 ghar se nikaal diya jaataa he
 Iraqi civilian Suru says Saddam Hussein created hatred between Shias and Sunnis, but the way his execution was shown in the media was wrong
 surung ne 10 saal pehle kii baton ko yaad karte hue bataaya ki jab saddaam ko faansee ho gai tab log kaaphi khush nazar aa rahe the or hawa main firing karte the
 It was a court decision and a right decision, but the way people were doing the party, it felt wrong

" isai dharm ke logon ko maaraa ja rahaa he

 Another special thing is that this big counter attack was carried out at the level of local commanders deployed in the area
 jisase ye baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki modi sarkaar ne kisi bhi hamalaa kaa jawaab dene ke liye army ko free hand diya hua he
 Pakistan's statement: Pakistan has rejected the claim of surgical strike by India

 com / bb24lb4whe adhikariyon ne kaha ki paranit cor ko kuch din pehle ek phone aayaa tha jab vah sansad satr main bhaag lene ke liye dilli main thim
 Describing himself as the manager of a nationalized bank, the caller told Kaur that he needed information about his bank account to deposit his salary
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki aakhirkaar vah saansad kii khaataa sankhya, atm pin, sivisi number or ek otipi (van time password) praapt karne main safal rahaa
 Police said Kaur then came to know through an SMS that an amount of Rs 23 lakh had been withdrawn from his account
 jiske baad unhone police ko ghatana kii soochna di
 Patiala Senior Superintendent of Police Mandeep Singh Sidhu said on Wednesday that the accused has been arrested and a team of Punjab Police is bringing him from Jharkhand
 8 november 2016 ko jab pradhanmantri narend modi achaanak tivi par aae to kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki kya kehane vaale hai
 It turned out that 500 and 1000 notes have been declared illegal and these notes will now have to be exchanged in banks
 chaaron taraf jo afra tafari machi wo aap jaanate hai
 Many thought then that black money would probably be gone
 pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan itnaa bhavuk tha ki laga ki kuch soch samaj kar hi kiya gaya hoga
 Then suddenly after several months, the Prime Minister says in an interview that he should not be evaluated only on the basis of demonetisation
 wo ab notebandi kaa zikr bhi nahin karte, kam se kam antim report aane par phir se raat ke aath baje ve achaanak tivi par aa sakate the
 Can still come now
 yaad kiijie notebandi kii wo line
 Especially women who had their money deposited, all of it went to husbands and fathers
 ek jatke main kisi bure vakt ke liye bachaa kar rakhe gaye paise nikaal kar dene pade kyonki ve ab ve avaidh ho chuke the
 Later, after returning the money to wives and daughters or not, they can tell there, but from women to common farmers, they got in line
 apana paisa jamaa karaane
 From 9 November 2016 to 30 December 2016, the money could be refunded
 sabane yahi kaha ki is line main paise vaala to dikh nahin rahaa
 It became a mystery and also a rumor
 phir ise counter karne ke liye ek nai gapp udayi gai jo zyaada kargar sabit hui
 That is, these poor people who are engaged in the line are not actually engaged for their money
 ye amiron ke agent banakar unke kamishan lekar line main lage hai or jandhan khate main jamaa kar rahe hai
 The dock media was doing amazing work
 us samay upi ke ek akhbaar ke patrkaar ne likhaa tha ki notebandi ke samay janata kii pareshaani kii khabar bheetar ke panne par hoti he or tarif kii khabar pehle panne par
 Then it was said that the money deposited in the Jan Dhan account would be investigated
 niskriy khaaton main jamaa ho rahe hai unki jaanch hogi
 It has not been found till date
 reserve bank kii salanaa report main bhi nahin he ki jandhan khaaton main jamaa kitna paisa kaala dhan tha, aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa
 Demonetisation took place in 2016
 2018 kaa agast he
 Demonetisation was not such a simple economic phenomenon that when the Reserve Bank presents the final report about it, then refer to page number 219
 itani der kyon lagi to yah bataaya gaya he ki noton ko kai baar gina gaya he isliye itnaa vakt laga
 What was the result? 8 november 2016 ko 500 or 1000 ke 15 lakh 41 hazaar karod ke note cirkulation main the
 Those who have come back after demonetisation have a value of 15 lakh 32 thousand crores
 yani 99
 30 percent of the notes went back to the banks
 notebandi ke baad 500 or 2000 ke nae note chhapane main hi 7,965 karod kharch ho gaye
 In the year 2016, the government had to spend 3,421 crores in printing new notes
 2016-17 main yah raashi dabl ho gai yani 7,965 karod
 10,000 crore just could not come back
 kaha gaya tha ki teen chaar lakh karod waapas nahin aaenge or nasht ho jaaenge
 Remember what was said in whatsapp University at that time
 jaali noton kii maatra na tab zyaada thi na ab band hui he
 The Reserve Bank report states that 154 in the number of counterfeit notes of 50 rupees
 3 pratishat vruddhi hui he
 Last year 638 notes of 2000 were caught and this year 17,929 were caught
 is report main yah bhi kaha he ki kuch zila sahakaarita bainkon main jo note waapas kiye the unhen reserve bank ne abhi sweekaar nahin kiya he kyonki yah maamla abhi adaalat ke saamne he
 The value of the money deposited in these cooperative banks is not yet known
 agar yah bhi shaamil ho jaae to waapas aae note kaa pratishat or bad saktaa he
 The emphasis on return of notes is because it was said at that time that 2-3 lakh crores will not come in banks
 amiron kaa kaala dhan jo takie or gadde ke neeche he ganga main bahaanaa padegaa
 If all the money was returned, then what was it that was shed in the Ganges? purana gadda
 Old Pillow
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko press conferes kii
 It directly accused the Rafale issue that the 70-year-old company Hindustan Aeronautics was not made a shareholder in the Rafale deal, why a company formed before the deal which owes several thousand crores to other affiliates was made a shareholder
 anil ambani kii company ne congress party par 5000 karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya he
 Our focus on demonetisation today
 sambit paatra jo kah rahe hai shaayad unhen vistaar se kehane kaa mauka nahin mila
 They should have told or told the Reserve Bank in their report how much money was caught from the investigation of 18 lakh accounts which was black money
 arthshaastri surajeet bhalla ne bhi mana he ki 2-3 lakh karod note vaapasi kaa jo daawa tha us hisaab se notebandi fail rahi
 But from the point of view of number of tax collectors or other reasons, it was successful
 2017-18 ke aarthik survey main likhaa he ki jo nae tex ritern aae, unamem se zyaadaatar un logon ke the jinaki iskar dene kii kshamta bhi nahin thi
 The number of returns increased but it did not have a huge impact on revenue
 abhi bhi tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya bahut nahin badi he
 Could all this not be achieved without demonetisation
 nae note chhapane main hi kai hazaar note kharch ho gaye
 atms closed
 kitni takalif hui
 Not only this, more cash is in the market at the time of demonetisation than it was in the market
 phir digital iconomi kya hui
 Think of those who kept crying in front of the Reserve Bank to get their money back
 yaad kiijie march 2017 kaa wo prime time
 At that time people from the village countryside came out of the Reserve Bank with their own lifetime earnings and stayed overnight that the note would be changed in the morning
 31 march 2017 tak enarai ke note badale jane kii taarikh thi, jabaki unamem se bhi bahuton kii nahin badali gai
 People kept coming in the months of January, February and March
 sochie kitna paisa bainkon ne aane se rah gaya
 By 30–31 March, the crowd outside the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation
 nae puraane noto ko ginate ginate ankhen thak gayi or unase galati hui
 Many branches did not have a note counting machine
 jahaan mashin thi vahaan bhi ginaney main chook hui
 Because the government did not make any preparations
 kisi kii galati kaa nateeja yah hua ki kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se, lone lekar 5000 se lekar dhai lakh tak jurmaana bharaa he
 We still showed it in prime time, wrote on Facebook, again i give some examples because even this is not known to the leaders
 maine pahchaan kisi kii nahin bataai he
 The comments 10 november ko maine apni jeb se 16,000 rupee die
 That day our branch was closed at four in the morning
 50 dinon tak har din subah 10 baje se 11 baje tak kaam karata rahaa
 i have given more than 16,000 leftovers
 meri selary 25000 thi, ek din main 16000 de aayaa
 It took two months to join a female cashier from Madhya Pradesh
 18000 selary thi
 Fined 20,000 in a single day
 indore kii ek mahila kaisier ko apni puri selary ke baraabar jurmaana bharna padaa
 26000 rupees
 ek kaisier ne bataaya ki ham logon ne 2 lakh 87 hazaar kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a bank worker from Jhansi had to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh
 iske liye use lone lenaa padaa
 a cashier from Patna said that he had given Rs 13,000 from his pocket at the time of demonetisation
 note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 So much note came that counting was a mistake
 baxur ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki use to apni jeb se 37000 bharne pade
 Cashier of Kanpur Dehat has written that 10,000 fine was paid
 gujarat ke ek branch ke kaisier ne 16,500 jurmaana bharaa
 a cashier from Gujarat had to fill 2 lakh 87 thousand
 dilli se ek banker ne likhaa he ki 10,000 kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 a cashier from Nashik wrote that he and the head cashier gave 56000 rupees
 6 din ke bheetar saadhe chah hazaar graahak 16 karod lekar aa gaye
 a cashier has written that every day he was fined 10,000 or sometimes 5000
 agar saare kaisier apana anubhav likh kar bhejein to ham rose prime time main shaamil karenge
 The information will be correct but reserve bank har bank se puch kar pataa kar saktaa he ki notebandi ke dauraan kaitiyaron se kitna paisa fine ke rup main vasula gaya
 However, the rupee on Thursday became 70 rupees and 82 paise to one dollar
 itihaas main itnaa neeche kabhi nahin gira tha
 Remember those lines of demonetisation
 khaskar mahilaayein jinke paas apana jamaa kiya hua paisa tha, wo sab patiyon or pitaaon ke haath chalaa gaya
 In one stroke, they had to withdraw money saved for a bad time because they were now illegal
 baad main ve paise laut kar patniyon or betiyon ke haath aae yaa nahin, vahiin bataa sakati hai magar mahilaon se lekar aam kisaanon tak line main lag gaye
 Deposit your money
 9 november 2016 se 30 disambar 2016 tak hi paise waapas ho sakate the
 Everyone said that money is not visible in this line
 yah ek rahasy ban gaya or afvaah bhi
 Then a new gab was introduced to counter it which proved more effective
 vah yah ki ye jo garib log line main lage hai wo darasal apane paise ke liye nahin lage hai
 They become agents of the rich and are engaged in the line taking their commission and depositing it in the Jan Dhan account
 godi media kamaal kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 At that time, a newspaper journalist from UP wrote that during the demonetisation, the news of public distress is on the inside page and the news of praise on the front page
 phir yah kaha jane laga ki jandhan khate main jinke paise jamaa ho rahe hai unki jaanch hogi
 Those deposited in inactive accounts will be investigated
 aaj tak uskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 Even in the annual report of the Reserve Bank, how much money was deposited in the Jan Dhan accounts was not known till date
 notebandi 2016 main hui thi
 It is August of 2018
 notebandi itani saadhaaran aarthik ghatana nahin thi ki uske bare main reserve bank jab antim report pesh kare to pej number 219 par zikr kare
 Why it took so long, it has been told that the notes have been counted many times, so it took so long
 nateeja kya niklaa
 On 8 November 2016, 15 lakh 41 thousand crore notes of 500 and 1000 were in circulation
 jo waapas aae hai notebandi ke baad unka vailu he 15 lakh 32 hazaar karod
 That is 99
 30 pratishat note waapas bainkon ke zarie pahunch gaye
 After demonetisation, 7,965 crore was spent in printing 500 and 2000 new notes
 sarkaar ko 2016 ke saal main nae note chhapane main 3,421 karod hi kharch karne pade the
 This amount doubled in 2016-17 i
e
 7,965 crore
 sirf 10,000 karod waapas nahin aa sake
 It was said that three four lakh crores will not be returned and will be destroyed
 yaad kiijie us samay whatsap uniwarsity main kya-kya kaha jaataa tha
 The quantity of counterfeit notes was neither high nor close now
 reserve bank kii report main kaha gaya he ki 50 rupee ke jaali noton kii sankhya main 154
 3 percent increase
 pichley saal 2000 ke 638 note pakade gaye or is saal 17,929 pakade gaye
 The report also said that the notes which were returned by some district cooperative banks have not been accepted by the Reserve Bank as the matter is still before the court
 in sahakaarita bainkon main jamaa paise kaa kitna vailu he yah abhi nahin bataaya gaya he
 If it is also included, the percentage of the returned note may increase further
 noton kii vaapasi par jor isliye he kyonki us vakt jor dekar kaha gaya tha ki 2-3 lakh karod bainkon main nahin aa paaenge
 The black money of the rich which is under the pillows and mattress will be shed in the Ganges
 agar sara paisa waapas hi aa gaya to phir ganga main jo bahaya gaya wo kya tha
 Old mattress
 purana takiya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held a press conference
 rafel masale par sidhaa aarope lagaaya ki 70 saal kii anbhavi company hindustan aronotics ko rafale deal main hissedaar nahin banaaya gaya, deal se pehle bani aisi company jisaki duusari sahyogi companiyon par kai hazaar karod kii dendaree he use hissedaar kyon banaaya gaya
 Anil Ambani's company has filed a defamation suit of Rs 5000 crore against the Congress party
 par hamaara focus aaj notebandi he
 Perhaps what Sambit Patra is saying is he did not get a chance to say in detail
 unhen bataanaa chahie tha yaa reserve bank ko apni report main bataanaa chahie tha ki 18 lakh khaaton kii jo jaanch hui unase kitna paisa pakadaa gaya jo kaala dhan tha
 Economist Surjit Bhalla has also admitted that the demonetization failed according to the claim of withdrawal of 2-3 lakh crore notes
 magar tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya yaa duusare kaarnon kii nazar se dekhen to safal rahi
 In the Economic Survey 2017-18, it is written that most of the new tax returns came from people who did not even have the ability to pay income tax
 ritern kii sankhya to badi magar rajasav par uskaa bahut bada asar nahin hua
 The number of tax collectors still has not increased much
 kya yah sara kuch bina notebandi ke hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Several thousand notes were spent in printing new notes
 atm band ho gaye
 What a problem it was
 yahi nahin notebandi ke samay jitna cash market main tha, usase zyada is vakt market main he
 Then what happened to the digital economy? un logon kaa sochie jo aakhir aakhir tak apane paise ko waapas karne ke liye reserve bank ke saamne rote rahe
 Remember that prime time of March 2017
 us samay gaanv dehaat se log apane hi jivan bhar kii kamai lekar rigerv bank ke baahar aakar raat raat bhar rukne lage ki subah note badla jayega
 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing
 kya ye bhi kaale dhan vaale the
 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake
 kai branch main note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he
 i have not revealed the identity to anyone
 tippaniyan On November 10, i gave Rs 16,000 out of my pocket
 us din hamaari shakha subah chaar baje band hui thi
 Worked every day from 10 am to 11 am for 50 days
 maine to 16,000 hi dae baakiyon ne to isse bhi zyada die
 My salary was 25000, 16000 was given in one day
 madhya pradesh kii ek mahila kaisier ko jwine kiye hue do maheene hue the
 18000 was salary
 ek din main hi 20,000 kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a female cashier from Indore had to pay a fine equal to her full salary
 26000 rupee
 a cashier told that we paid a fine of 2 lakh 87 thousand
 jhaansi ke ek bankkarmi ko 2 lakh kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 For this, he had to take a loan
 patna ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki notebandi ke samay apni jeb se 13,000 rupee die the
 There was no note counting machine
 itnaa note aa gaya ki ginate ginate galati ho gai
 a cashier from Buxar told that he had to fill 37000 from his pocket
 kanpur dehaat ke kaisier ne likhaa he ki 10,000 jurmaana bharaa
 The cashier of a branch in Gujarat paid a fine of 16,500
 gujarat ke hi ek kaisier ko 2 lakh 87 hazaar bharne pade
 a banker from Delhi wrote that he had to pay a fine of 10,000
 nashik se ek kaisier ne likhaa ki unke or head kaisier ne 56000 rupee die
 Six and a half thousand customers arrived with 16 crores within 6 days
 ek kaisier ne likhaa he ki har din kabhi 10,000 to kabhi 5000 jurmaana bharna padaa
 If all the cashiers send their experience in writing, then we will include it daily in prime time
 jaankaree sahi dijiega lekin
 The Reserve Bank can ask every bank to find out how much money was collected from the cashiers as fine during the demonetisation
 vaise rupaya guuruuvaar ko ek dollar ke 70 rupee 82 paise kaa ho gaya
 Never in history had it fallen so low
 notebandi itani saadhaaran aarthik ghatana nahin thi ki uske bare main reserve bank jab antim report pesh kare to pej number 219 par zikr kare

 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing
 kya ye bhi kaale dhan vaale the
 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake
 kai branch main note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he
 i have not revealed the identity to anyone
 tippaniyan On November 10, i gave Rs 16,000 out of my pocket
 us din hamaari shakha subah chaar baje band hui thi
 Worked every day from 10 am to 11 am for 50 days
 maine to 16,000 hi dae baakiyon ne to isse bhi zyada die
 My salary was 25000, 16000 was given in one day
 madhya pradesh kii ek mahila kaisier ko jwine kiye hue do maheene hue the
 18000 was salary
 ek din main hi 20,000 kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a female cashier from Indore had to pay a fine equal to her full salary
 26000 rupee
 a cashier told that we paid a fine of 2 lakh 87 thousand
 jhaansi ke ek bankkarmi ko 2 lakh kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 For this, he had to take a loan
 patna ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki notebandi ke samay apni jeb se 13,000 rupee die the
 There was no note counting machine
 itnaa note aa gaya ki ginate ginate galati ho gai
 a cashier from Buxar told that he had to fill 37000 from his pocket
 kanpur dehaat ke kaisier ne likhaa he ki 10,000 jurmaana bharaa
 The cashier of a branch in Gujarat paid a fine of 16,500
 gujarat ke hi ek kaisier ko 2 lakh 87 hazaar bharne pade
 a banker from Delhi wrote that he had to pay a fine of 10,000
 nashik se ek kaisier ne likhaa ki unke or head kaisier ne 56000 rupee die
 Six and a half thousand customers arrived with 16 crores within 6 days
 ek kaisier ne likhaa he ki har din kabhi 10,000 to kabhi 5000 jurmaana bharna padaa
 If all the cashiers send their experience in writing, then we will include it daily in prime time
 jaankaree sahi dijiega lekin
 The Reserve Bank can ask every bank to find out how much money was collected from the cashiers as fine during the demonetisation
 vaise rupaya guuruuvaar ko ek dollar ke 70 rupee 82 paise kaa ho gaya
 Never in history had it fallen so low
 8 november 2016 ko 500 or 1000 ke 15 lakh 41 hazaar karod ke note cirkulation main the
 Those who have come back after demonetisation have a value of 15 lakh 32 thousand crores
 yani 99
 30 percent of the notes went back to the banks
 notebandi ke baad 500 or 2000 ke nae note chhapane main hi 7,965 karod kharch ho gaye
 In the year 2016, the government had to spend 3,421 crores in printing new notes
 2016-17 main yah raashi dabl ho gai yani 7,965 karod
 10,000 crore just could not come back
 kaha gaya tha ki teen chaar lakh karod waapas nahin aaenge or nasht ho jaaenge
 Remember what was said in whatsapp University at that time
 jaali noton kii maatra na tab zyaada thi na ab band hui he
 The Reserve Bank report states that 154 in the number of counterfeit notes of 50 rupees
 3 pratishat vruddhi hui he
 Last year 638 notes of 2000 were caught and this year 17,929 were caught
 is report main yah bhi kaha he ki kuch zila sahakaarita bainkon main jo note waapas kiye the unhen reserve bank ne abhi sweekaar nahin kiya he kyonki yah maamla abhi adaalat ke saamne he
 The value of the money deposited in these cooperative banks is not yet known
 agar yah bhi shaamil ho jaae to waapas aae note kaa pratishat or bad saktaa he
 The emphasis on return of notes is because it was said at that time that 2-3 lakh crores will not come in banks
 amiron kaa kaala dhan jo takie or gadde ke neeche he ganga main bahaanaa padegaa
 If all the money was returned, then what was it that was shed in the Ganges? purana gadda
 Old Pillow

 arthshaastri surajeet bhalla ne bhi mana he ki 2-3 lakh karod note vaapasi kaa jo daawa tha us hisaab se notebandi fail rahi
 But from the point of view of number of tax collectors or other reasons, it was successful
 2017-18 ke aarthik survey main likhaa he ki jo nae tex ritern aae, unamem se zyaadaatar un logon ke the jinaki iskar dene kii kshamta bhi nahin thi
 The number of returns increased but it did not have a huge impact on revenue

 Could all this not be achieved without demonetisation
 nae note chhapane main hi kai hazaar note kharch ho gaye

 Not only this, more cash is in the market at the time of demonetisation than it was in the market

 By 30–31 March, the outcrop of the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation

 Many branches did not have a note counting machine

 us samay gaanv dehaat se log apane hi jivan bhar kii kamai lekar rigerv bank ke baahar aakar raat raat bhar rukne lage ki subah note badla jayega
 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing
 kya ye bhi kaale dhan vaale the
 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake
 kai branch main note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he
 i have not revealed the identity to anyone
 tippaniyan On November 10, i gave Rs 16,000 out of my pocket
 us din hamaari shakha subah chaar baje band hui thi
 Worked every day from 10 am to 11 am for 50 days
 maine to 16,000 hi dae baakiyon ne to isse bhi zyada die
 My salary was 25000, 16000 was given in one day
 madhya pradesh kii ek mahila kaisier ko jwine kiye hue do maheene hue the
 18000 was salary
 ek din main hi 20,000 kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a female cashier from Indore had to pay a fine equal to her full salary
 26000 rupee
 a cashier told that we paid a fine of 2 lakh 87 thousand
 jhaansi ke ek bankkarmi ko 2 lakh kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 For this, he had to take a loan
 patna ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki notebandi ke samay apni jeb se 13,000 rupee die the
 There was no note counting machine
 itnaa note aa gaya ki ginate ginate galati ho gai
 a cashier from Buxar told that he had to fill 37000 from his pocket
 kanpur dehaat ke kaisier ne likhaa he ki 10,000 jurmaana bharaa
 The cashier of a branch in Gujarat paid a fine of 16,500

 a banker from Delhi wrote that he had to pay a fine of 10,000
 nashik se ek kaisier ne likhaa ki unke or head kaisier ne 56000 rupee die
 Six and a half thousand customers arrived with 16 crores within 6 days
 ek kaisier ne likhaa he ki har din kabhi 10,000 to kabhi 5000 jurmaana bharna padaa
 If all the cashiers send their experience in writing, then we will include it daily in prime time
 jaankaree sahi dijiega lekin
 The Reserve Bank can ask every bank to find out how much money was collected from the cashiers as fine during the demonetisation
 vaise rupaya guuruuvaar ko ek dollar ke 70 rupee 82 paise kaa ho gaya
 Never in history had it fallen so low
 2017-18 ke aarthik survey main likhaa he ki jo nae tex ritern aae, unamem se zyaadaatar un logon ke the jinaki iskar dene kii kshamta bhi nahin thi
 The number of returns increased but it did not have a huge impact on revenue
 abhi bhi tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya bahut nahin badi he
 Could all this not be achieved without demonetisation
 nae note chhapane main hi kai hazaar note kharch ho gaye
 atms closed
 kitni takalif hui
 Not only this, more cash is in the market at the time of demonetisation than it was in the market
 phir digital iconomi kya hui
 Think of those who kept crying in front of the Reserve Bank to get their money back
 yaad kiijie march 2017 kaa wo prime time
 At that time people from the village countryside came out of the Reserve Bank with their own lifetime earnings and stayed overnight that the note would be changed in the morning
 31 march 2017 tak enarai ke note badale jane kii taarikh thi, jabaki unamem se bhi bahuton kii nahin badali gai
 People kept coming in the months of January, February and March
 sochie kitna paisa bainkon ne aane se rah gaya
 By 30–31 March, the crowd outside the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation
 nae puraane noto ko ginate ginate ankhen thak gayi or unase galati hui
 Many branches did not have a note counting machine
 jahaan mashin thi vahaan bhi ginaney main chook hui
 Because the government did not make any preparations
 kisi kii galati kaa nateeja yah hua ki kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se, lone lekar 5000 se lekar dhai lakh tak jurmaana bharaa he
 We still showed it in prime time, wrote on Facebook, again i give some examples because even this is not known to the leaders

 The Congress attacked the Election Commission, calling it a black spot on democracy, and said that the Commission had lost its credibility
 mayawati ne bhi isi maamle par ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa
 On the decision of the Election Commission, Congress spokesperson Randit Singh Surjewala said that the Election Commission has been known for its boldness and impartiality, but now that the process of fair elections is in danger, the Commission looks scared, tired, helpless and confused
 Used to be
 aisa lagata he chunaav aachaar samhita ab modi kii chunaav prachaar samhita ban gai he
 The Commission has lost its credibility
 chunaav ayog natmastakcongress ne chunaav ayog par ek baar phir hamalaa karte hue is faisle ko loktantr par kaala dhabba qaraar diya
 On behalf of the Congress, Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the Election Commission has fallen down before Modi and Shah
 ayog ke faisle ke modi kii raily kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 He said that today when Modi, Shah and BJP are being attacked directly on democracy, the Election Commission is watching the demise of democracy by getting scared, tired and helpless
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se kolkata main bijepi ke gundon ne ishwar chand vidyasagar kii murti todi or phir bhi koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Criticizing the commission, Surjewala said that the way the Election Commission stopped campaigning in West Bengal 19 hours ago yesterday, it is a black spot on the country's democracy
 ayog ne ghatana ke 24 ghante baad aaj raat 10 baje ke baad chunaav prachaar par kyon roak lagaai
 It seems that with the decision of the Commission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been given free pass for two rallies in Mathurapur and Dum Dum today
 congress ne kaha ki is aadesh ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 kii paripati or anuchhed 14 evam 21 kii paripati or manyataon ko dhoomil kiya he
 The Election Commission order seems to be a gift to Modi

 Amit Shah was leading the road show, instead of punishing him, the Election Commission is saying that he is powerless and mute spectator
 kya modi or amit shah ne chunaav ayog kii nishpakshta or nirbhikta par jabaran kabja kar liya he? aaj desh kaa naagarik chunaav ayog se kuch sawaalon ke jawaab chahta he
 Surjewala said that the Congress had filed 11 complaints with evidence in which the election code of conduct was grossly violated by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 baavjood iske, chunaav ayog dwaara koi karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 Modi and Shah are constantly breaking the code of conduct
 mayawati ne chunaav ayog par barasate hue kaha ki ayog ne pashchim bengal main 10 baje raat se chunaav prachaar par bain isliye lagaaya he jisase din main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bengal main do chunavi reliyaan ho sake
 If the Election Commission has banned the campaign, why not from morning itself? However, in Bihar, outside the Congress, bjp's JDU has demanded the dismissal of the Bengal government on the same matter

 The condition of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been critical for the last 24 hours
 unhen ames main phul life saport par rakhaa gaya he
 All leaders of the ruling and opposition are wishing for Vajpayee's longevity
 jansangh, janata party or baad main bijepi kii neenv rakhane vaale chehron main se ek naam atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa bhi he
 The BJP was formed on 6 April 1980, as a political party in the first Lok Sabha elections, the party had only two seats in its account
 iske baavjood vaajapeyi ne haar nahin maani or unhone kaha tha, 'andhera chantega, suraj nikalegaa, camel khilegaa
 'the result of this is that at the present time there are BJP governments in 20 states of the country from the power of the Center
 atalji ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karental bihari vaajapeyi kaa janm 25 disambar 1924 ko hua, is din ko bharat main bada din kaha jaataa he
 He is currently away from active politics due to poor health, due to his deteriorating health, he was admitted to AIIMS in Delhi
 desh ke raajnneetikitihaas main bijepine jab entry kii thi to us samay shaayad hi kisi ne bhi sochaa hoga ki ek din party desh ke aadhe hisse main satta sambhaal rahi hogi
 Vajpayee played the most important role in taking the BJP from zero to the summit
 vajayapi 1942 main raajnneeti main us samay aae, jab bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan unke bhai 23 dinon ke liye jail gaye
 In 1951, Vajpayee formed the Bharatiya Jana Sangh Party in collaboration with the RSS which included leaders like Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 1957 main vaajapeyi pehali baar balrampur sansadeey seat se chunaav jitkar rajyasabha ke sadsy bane
 Seeing the extraordinary personality of Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of that time, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, had said that this person would definitely become the Prime Minister in the coming days
 1968 menvajpeyirashtriya jansangh ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane
 At that time there were leaders like Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok and Lal Krishna Advani with the party
 1975-77 main apatkaal ke dauraan vaajapeyi anya netaaon ke saath us samay giraftaar kar liye gaye, jab ve apatkaal ke liye indira gandhi kii aalochana kar rahe the
 In 1977, there was opposition to the Emergency led by Jayaprakash Narayan, the great general of the Janata Party
 jail se chhootane ke baad vajayapi ne jansangh kaa janata party main vilay kar liya
 The Janata Party won the Lok Sabha elections in 1977 and became the Minister of External Affairs in the Morarji Bhai Desai-led government
 videsh mantri banane ke baad vaajapeyi pehle aise netaa the jinhone sanyukt raashtra mahasang ko hindi bhashaa main sambodhit kiya
 The Janata Party government fell in 1979, but by that time Vajpayee had identified himself as an experienced leader and speaker
 iske baad janata party antarkalah ke kaaran bikhar gai or 1980 main vaajapeyi ke saath puraane dost bhi janata party chhod bhartiya janata party se jud gaye
 Vajpayee became the first national president of the BJP and became one of the biggest critics of the Congress government
 1994 main karnataka, 1995 main gujarat or maharashtra main party jab chunaav jeet gai uske baad party ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani ne vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 Vajpayee became Prime Minister 3 times from 1996 to 2004
 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi desh kii sabase badi party banakar ubhari or vaajapeyi pehali baar pradhanmantri bane
 However, his government collapsed in 13 days for not achieving an absolute majority in Parliament
 1998 ke dobaaraa loksabhaa chunaav main party ko zyada siten milin or kuch anya partiyon ke sahyog se vaajapeyi ne endie kaa gathan kiya or ve phir pradhanmantri bane
 This government lasted for 13 months, but in the middle Jayalalithaa's party left the government, due to which the government fell
 1999 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi phir se satta main ai or is baar vaajapeyi ne apana kaarykaal puraa kiya

 NCP President Sharad Pawar had put two conditions to support the BJP
 pehali shart thi centre kii raajnneeti main sakriy beti supriya sule ke liye baari bharkam krishi mantralay or duusari devendra fadanvis kii jagah kisi or ko mukhyamantri bananaa
 When this matter came in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he was not ready to accept these conditions to form the government
 bhaajapa sutron ne bataaya ki party netritv ko laga ki agar maharashtra main samarthan hasil karne ke liye rakanpa ko krishi mantralay de diya gaya, to phir bihar main purana sahyogi jad (you) rail mantralay ke liye daawa thok kar dharmsankat paidaa kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, despite the overwhelming majority, two big ministries can come out of the hands of BJP
 sutron ne pavaar kii duusari shart ke bare main bataaya ki jis tarah se maharashtra jaise rajya main devendra fadanvis paanch saal tak bedaag satta chalaane main safal rahe or vidhansabha chunaav main bhi party ne unhen mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa banaakar chunaav ladaa, 24 oktober ko nattejey aane ke din party mukhyalay par kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne fadanvis ke hi netritv main sarkaar banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi, iske baad fadanvis kii jagah kisi duusare ko siem banane kii shart maananaa bhi bhaajapa ke liye naammumkin tha
 Sources say that in order to accept both these demands, Sharad Pawar had sent time to BJP and modi-shah to give time for consideration
 yahi vajah he ki nattejey aane ke baad pavaar ne bhaajapa netritv ke khilaaf aisa kuch tikhaa nahin bolaa tha, jis par bhaajapa se javaabi pratikriya aane kii gunjaaish rahati
 The rhetoric only continued between the Shiv Sena and the BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki maangon par bhaajapa kii taraf se sakaaratmak rukh na milane par 20 november ko jab sansad bhawan main pradhanmantri narendra modi se sharad pavaar mili to kareeb 45-50 minute lambii baatcheet chali
 However, in this meeting also Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not agree to both the demands of Sharad Pawar nor did he openly say anything
 is bich 22 november ko ratorat sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne baagi hokar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane kii peshkash kar di
 Initial reports said that 30-35 mlas along with Ajit Pawar are ready to break up and form government with BJP
 yah bhi kaha jane laga ki isamen sharad pavaar kii bhi maun sahmati he
 But later, Sharad Pawar tweeted, dismissing ncp's alliance with BJP and said that Ajit Pawar's decision to join the government was personal
 sutara bataate hai ki sharad pavaar ko aakhir tak ummid thi ki shivasena ke saath chhodane ke kaaran asahaay hui bhaajapa unki donon badi maangen maan legi, magar aisa nahin hua
 Ultimately, Sharad Pawar took the final step of forming the government along with the Congress and Shiv Sena
 sharad pavaar ko maaloom tha ki 54 vidhayak hone ke kaaran unke donon haathon main ladd he
 On one hand, the head of Chanakya will be tied on his head and if he goes to BJP, there is scope to get maximum benefits including participation in the central government
 sangh or bhaajapa maamalon ke jaankaar nagpur ke dilip devdhar nekaha, "sangh parivaar main sharad pavaar kii in do sharton kii kaaphi charchaa rahi, haalanki usase bhi zyada charchaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dabaavon ke aage na jhukne kii rahi
 Agriculture being a major issue of farmers in Maharashtra, the Ministry of Agriculture is very friendly to the politics there
 sharad pavaar purv main krishi mantri rah bhi chuke hai
 Fadnavis is looking for Modi for the second chief minister's post, so there was no question of sideline him
 sharad pavaar ko jab laga ki bhaajapa unki maangon ko nahin maanane vaali he, to unhone aakhirkaar congress-shivasena ke saath pehle se sarkaar banane ko lekar chal rahi baatcheet ko hi mukaam par pahunchane kaa faisla kiya

 But we and you have already read at least two hundred such poems

 But, as soon as the poems of the collection come to the turtle, there is a new and refreshing attitude of Poonam Sinha's poems

 Poonam Sinha is the best among those poems

 Overall, if Poonam is able to retain her familiar style, her second collection has more scope for improvement and development

 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has termed demonetisation as a 'catastrophic economy policy' and said that this could increase inequality and would prove to be the 'biggest social disaster ever' in a diversified country like India
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi se kaha ki is 'baari galati' ko sweekaar karen or arthvyavastha ke punarnirmaan ke liye aam sahmati kii disha main kaam karen
 He said, 'demonetisation is going to be a disastrous economic policy
 iske kaaran kai tarah kii aarthik, saamaajik, pratishthatmak or sansthagat kshati hui he
 The fall of GDP is merely an indicator of economic loss
 iskaa hamaare samaaj ke garib tabakon par or vyapaar par jo asar hua he, vah kisi aarthik suchak kii tulana main kahin adhik hanikaarak he
 'the former Prime Minister said,' This (demonetisation) has an immediate effect on jobs

 haalanki jidipi main haal kii giravat ke baad sudhaar dikh rahi he lekin hamaare aarthik vikaas kii prakruti ke liye badhati asamanta ek bada khatra he

 In such a situation, it has been revealed that phone calls are coming to some politicians who are claiming the claim and they are being told that your name has come in the survey for the ticket
 'is par gahalot ne daawa kiya he ki thagi ke liye netaaon ke paas jo phone aa rahe hai wo pike kii team ke naam se aa rahe hai
 Ashok Gehlot claimed that money has been demanded from many people by making such phone calls

 Ashok Gehlot has made serious allegations against the team of 'PK team' which was the slogan of 'prakash Kishore (PK)', which used to chant slogans like '27 years UP Behala' which hurt the opposition for the Congress victory in UP
 
 unhone kaha ki pike kii team kaa naam lekar phone kiya ja rahaa he jo ki ab congress ke paas nahin he

 mid way between normal n tipsya post shared by @farahkhankunder on Dec 9, 2016 at 9:44 pm PST america main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bharat or china kaa pradarshan hi is baat ko tay karegaa ki duniya kaa kis tarah nayaa aakaar legi
 However, it does not matter that both countries choose the path for development
 bharat main loktantr he, jabaki china main loktantr nahin hai
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that while interacting with students at Princeton University in the US, there is a lot of coordination between India and America
 unhone kaha ki badi sankhya main do tarah kaa pravaas ho rahaa he- pehla puri tarah swatantra he, jabaki doosraa puri tarah niyantrit he
 The fabric of administration deals with it differently
 rahul gandhi ne kahaaki bharat or china duniya ke do bade desh hai, jo kheti karne vaale desh se shahari aadhunik model desh main tabdeel ho rahe hai
 a large proportion of the world's population lives in these countries
 unhone kaha ki kaise ye donon desh mul rup se duniya ko nayaa aakaar dene ja rahe hai
 Let me not say whether China is democratic or not
 unhone apana rasta chunaa he or hamane apana rasta chunaa he
 Gandhi said that there is cooperation and competition between the two largest population countries of the world
 hamen yah dekhnaa he ki kaise ham rojgaar laaen
 Actually we have to compete with China
 unhone kaha ki bharat acha pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that China is making its way through the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project
 china kaa duniya kii taraf ek khaas vijan he, jo behad spasht he
 From his perspective, this is a very powerful vision
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ne bharat ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae
 He questioned whether India has a similar vision? How is that vision? How much cooperation is going to happen between us and them? These are some basic questions, but what needs to be known is that China is moving ahead with immense power and we have to work with it
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki rojgaar paidaa karne va shiksha ke kshetra main america or bharat ke bich sahyog ke liye bahut sambhaavnaaen hai
 There is a close coordination between the two countries
 aitihaasik rup se bharat ne sambandhon main santulan banaae rakhaa he
 India also has relations with China and Russia
 uske america or donon deshon se sambandh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that diplomatic relations with America are important for me
 unhone anya sabhi deshon ke saath sambandhon main santulan banaae rakhane kii jarurat par jor diya
 In response to a question, he said that it is important to maintain balance in relation to all other countries

 yahi kuch naare hai jo aajkal har gurudware main gunj rahe hai
 In every gurudwara special preparations are being made for the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Saheb
 vaise to har gurudwara apane aap main khaas he lekin aaj ham aapako us gurudware ke bare main bataaenge jisaki sthapana khud gurunanak sahib ne kii thi
 When Gurunanak ji first came to Delhi in 1505, he established this gurudwara, hence this gurudwara is very important for the Sikh community
 harvinder singh chairmen, nanak pyau gurudwara, kaa kahana he ki ye bahut pracheen gurudwara he or dilli kaa pehla gurudwara he
 Therefore, we celebrate this jubilee with great enthusiasm here
 kaise naam rakhaa gaya iskaa naam 'nanak pyau gurudwara'is gurudware kaa naam he nanak pyau gurudwara
 Now you must be wondering why the name of this gurudwara is Nanak Pyaw? Well how was this name? So, tell you the whole story behind this name
 darasal, jab gurunanak ji pehali baar dilli aae tab wo isi jagah par ruke the
 Today this place is known as GT Karnal Road
 kehete hai us samay is ilaake main pani pinaa naseeb nahin hota tha
 Saline water came out of the ground, due to which people were getting upset
 bacchon kii tabiyat bighad rahi thi
 Then Gurunanak Saheb, with his power, with his eyes, extracted sweet water from the ground
 jiske baad yahaan rahane vaale tamaam logo ne yahaan pani piya
 After which, the diseases he was getting were also eradicated
 ye silsilaa 500 saal baad yani aaj bhi lagaataar chal rahaa he
 Even today, sweet water comes out of the well
 aaj yahaan ek pyau he
 For this reason, this gurudwara was named Nanak Piyau Gurdwara
 yahaan ke logon kaa maananaa he ki desh bhar se log yahaan aate hai or is pani ko pikar jate hai jiske baad unki tamaam takaliphen, tamaam bimaariyaan khatm ho jaati hai
 The langarnanak has been operating for 500 years in Gurudwara, the first langar was started by Gurunanak ji himself and since then, that is why langar has been running here for 500 years
 rojaanaa hi hajaaron log yahaan khaanaa khaane aate hai
 Nobody goes hungry
 lakkha singh kaa kahana he ki 500 saalon se yahaan lungar isi tarah chalata aa rahaa he
 But the dishes are being made here to commemorate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak
 matar paneer , mix veg se lekar kheer tak kii vyavastha yahaan kii gai he
 Looking at this festival here, it seems as if Guru Nanak himself is present here and his birthday is being celebrated
 is din yahaan mahilaayein bhi lungar ke liye seva dene main peeche nahin hatati
 Special preparations in gurudwaras Special preparations are being made in the gurudwaras of the temple from langar to decoration
 gurunanak sahibaki 548 veen jayanti
 There is no bigger festival for the Sikh community
 isi ke chalate gharon se lekar gurudwaron tak utsav manaaya jaataa he
 The dishes are made, the decorations are done
 
 The cake is cut and kirtan is performed at gurdwaras
 chunki gurunanak sahib ne hi is nanak pyau kii sthapana kii thi is vajah se yahaan khaas taiyaari kii ja rahi hai
 Every corner of the gurudwara is being decorated with flowers
 puure gurudware ko lite se sajaa diya gaya he
 It will not be wrong to say that all preparations have been made to observe the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in Delhi and now the gurdwaras will be very bright for the next two days

 This saying may not be prevalent in China
 lekin dalai lamas kii arunachal pradesh yatra se baukhalaayaa china is kahawat kaa sateek udhaaharan jarur ban gaya he
 Now we tell one by one about the reason of hatred of Dalai Lama and greed for Arunachal Pradesh in China
 lekin sabase pehle aapako bataate hai ki 81 saal ke bujurg dalai lamas se china itnaa chidhata kyon he?darasalcheen or dalai lamas ke bich dushmanika itihaas hi china or tibet ke rishton kaa itihaas he
 1
 itihaas ke pannon ko palatney par pataa chalata he ki 12veen sadi tak tibet ek azaad desh tha, jo bharat or china ke bich bafer state yani vivaadit jagah bana hua tha
 2
 bharat ke saath to tibet ke sadiyon puraane sambandh rahe hai
 In the British era, Indian Railways used to run in Tibet
 3
 The Indian Post Office and the Indian Police were present in Tibet
 4
 a contingent of Indian Army was also deployed to protect Tibet
 5
 Indian currency used to move in Tibet
 6
 Like Bhutan, Tibet also depended on India in terms of foreign security
 7
 After the independence of India, China annexed Tibet and made its share 8
 tibet ke logon ne china kii is chaal kaa virodh kiya to china ne tibet ke buddha mathon ko todna or tibet ke sabase bade dharmaguru dalai lamas ko tang karnaa shuru kar diya
 9
 varsh 1959 main china kii sena ne lhasa main tibet ke liye jari sangharsh ko kuchalane ke liye dalai lamas ko giraftaar karne kii sajeesh rachi
 When the Chinese army wanted to arrest the Dalai Lama and take him to Beijing, the Dalai Lama fled to India along with hundreds of his colleagues overnight
 10
 China asked India to return the Dalai Lama but the then Prime Minister Pandit Nehru did not agree to it
 tab se lekar abtak china dalai lamas ko apana dushman or tibet kaa algaavvaadi netaa ghoshit karata aayaa he
 There is hardly any question left in your mind about China's irritation with the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of Tibet
 lekin ab agar aap ye soch rahe hai ki china ko dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh jane par hi itnaa aitraaj kyon he to is sawaal kaa jawaab bhi china kii dadaageeri vaali chaal main chipa he
 The fact is that China claims 90 thousand square kilometers of land in Arunachal Pradesh
 mukhya taur par arunachal pradesh ke tawang ko dakshin tibet kaa hissaa maanata he
 China states that the 15th-century Dalai Lama was born in Tawang, so Tawang is part of Tibet
 lekin sach ye he ki 1914 main aaazaad tibet ke pratinidhiyon ne shimla main hui baithak main tawang ke ilaake ko bharat ko saunp diya tha
 China had not objected to this issue until the capture of Tibet in 1959 and the Dalai Lama fled to India
 lekin 1962 main bharat-china yuddh ke baad china ne tawang sahit puure arunachal pradesh par kabja kar liya tha
 However, he later called the india-china border line in Arunachal Pradesh, called the mcmahon Line
 usase peeche laut gaya tha
 Since then, India and China have been negotiated 15 times till now to resolve this dispute
