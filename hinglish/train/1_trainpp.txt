 Bahubali Rajesh Ranjan aka Pappu Yadav is now seen as a completely changed person
 ve nalanda open uniwarsity se samajashaastra main eme kar rahe hai or 2012 main beur jail se eme kii pariksha dene vaale ekmaatr kaidi hai
 Pappu Yadav's first year examination is going on these days
 ve jail main hi apni kothri se pariksha de rahe hai
 While taking the exam, Pappu Yadav tries hard to fill all the pages of the answer book in the presence of an invigilator
 pappu ne jab loksabhaa main purniya or madhepura siton kaa chaar baar pratinidhitiv kiya tha, tab ve sirf intermediat paas hua karte the
 Later, while in Tihar Jail, he earned a degree in Human Rights and Disaster Management
 ab unka khwab aage chalakar piechdi karnaa he
 This 46-year-old Bahubali has been lodged in Patna's Beur Central Jail since bail was canceled in August 2010 and then arrested from a hospital in Gurgaon
 sipii-em ke vidhayak ajit sarkaar kii june, 1998 main hui hatya kii sajeesh rachane ke liye pappu yadav ko farvari 2008 main umrakaid kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 Due to this punishment, they have already been deprived of their right to contest elections
 may, 1999 main pehali baar giraftaar hue pappu yadav ek dashak se zyada samay salaakhon ke peeche guzaar chuke hai
 Now it seems that his conscience has dominated that Pappu Yadav, who once used to be reckless and reckless king
 pappu yadav apni aatmakatha likh rahe hai, jiskaa sheershak abhi tay nahin he
 Anyone who has seen him writing a diary says that this autobiography will be very heavy
 sawaal yah he ki pappu ko yah ehsaas kab hua ki unki kalam unki talwaar se kahin zyada taqatvar he?jail main unke ek saathi bataate hai, ''aatmakatha likhnaa apni pratishtha dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye he kyonki pappu sochate hai ki ab unhen sirf apane lekhan or shaikshanik yogyata ke boote hi samaaj main sammaan mil saktaa he
 Beur is sentenced to life in prison, including Pappu studies, philanthropy, web column writing and many other positive things that are not generally recognized
 ve pehali baar 1990 main 25 varsh kii umr main nirdaleey vidhayak bane the
 In June 2011, when the Patna police reached Beur Central Jail and suddenly raided Pappu Yadav's cell, this former MP was found writing something
 pappu yadav kii chhavi vaale insaan or us par bhi jab vah jail main rah rahaa ho, ke liye yah ek behad asaamaanya baat thi
 Pappu Yadav may need to make some improvements in his writing style but he has been making a lot of efforts to get rid of the lurid stain of his image and has already finished one-fourth of his autobiography
 jelon main unka pichhlaa safar alag tarah kaa tha
 In September 2004, Pappu gave a grand party to inmates at Beur Jail to celebrate his bail
 usee saal, usne jelon se koi 670 baar phone lagaaya tha or inamen se kuch number bihar ke mantriyon ke bhi the
 In December 2004, Pappu was caught in jail holding a court of supporters, on which the Supreme Court ordered him to be sent to Tihar Jail in Delhi
 abhi tak beur jail main unki maujuudagi kuch khaas ghatnatmak nahin rahi he
 Pappu's exercise of bringing himself out of his past has also inspired him to do well for others
 pichley saal unke sanghathan yuva shakti ke kaaryakartaaon ne ek pratibhashali gayika anshumala kii kidney ke pratyaropan ke liye 6 lakh ru
 Were mobilized
 anshumala ko uske sasuralwaalon ne chhod diya tha
 This is just one of Pappu Yadav's many examples of helping people in trouble
 kaaryakartaaon ke yogadan ke alaava, pappu kii purv saansad patni ranjita ranjan or paanch bahanen, unki dusron kii bhalaai karne kii hasaraton ko puraa karte rahane ke liye apane sansadhano ko jhonkati rahati hai
 Pappu and his wife have also set up some schools and vocational training centers, where the poor get education at subsidized rates
 beur jail kii librari main jitne bhi akhbaar mangaaye jate hai, pappu un sab kaa adhyayan karte hai
 They make news notes describing the conditions of the poor
 har saptaah, vyaktigat courier in sifarshi nots ko ranjita ranjan tak pahunchaata he
 Pappu has forbidden his wife to come to jail
 yah jaahir taur par us shaks ke liye bada badlaav he, jo ateet main khatarnaak don hua karata tha
 Pappu's name was once heavily dominated in Bihar
 nabbe ke dashak main jab apradhi se netaa banane waalon kii chhavi aasmaan chune lagi thi, pappu yadav tab badi aasaani se har ore dabangai dikhaa rahe the or logon ko apni ichha ke aage jhukaate ja rahe the
 The only special thing in this past was to mold himself into the image of Robinhood
 apane dabadabe ke boote, pappu prashasan ko lok-lubhaavan nitiyaan apnaane ke liye majaboor karne main safal ho jaaya karte the
 There were hardly any power cuts in his constituency in those days
 apane ubhaar ke dinon main, pappu doctoron se garibon kaa muft ilaaj karavaate the, bhrasht afasarshah unke dar se kaanpate rahete the
 He was also a standard for the Khanty caste monasteries, who had been pushed to the center of politics by the fragmented society of Bihar
 apane nirvachan kshetra se sambandhit muddon par aksar antim faisla unheen kaa hota tha
 Pappu has been almost in jail since he was arrested in May 1999 in connection with the murder of CPI-M MLA Ajit Sarkar
 unhen teen baar jamaanat mili thi or teenon baar supreme court ne ise fouran radd karke unhen waapas jail bhej diya
 Purnia, a four-time CPI-M MLA, had a strong support base in Purnia, Purnia was also the one to take Pappu Yadav to the limelight of political fame
 ek vishesh adaalat main daakhil sibiai kii chargeshit main kaha gaya he ki ajit sarkaar kaa khaatmaa isliye karavaaya gaya tha, kyonki unhone 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pappu yadav kii chunavi haar sunishchit karai thi
 Pappu was punished by this CBI charge sheet
 haalanki pappu ne is sajaa ke khilaaf apil kar rakhi he
 Pappu's worst time began in February 2008 when a special CBI court sentenced him to life imprisonment
 mouj bhare dinon ke dost pappu se kinaaraa kar gaye
 Soon, he is in a state of deep introspection and realizes that his life is in dire need of improvement
 pappu kaa daawa he ki unhone jitne paap kiye hai, usase adhik paap unke khilaaf kiye gaye hai; lekin unhen ab kisi ke khilaaf koi shikaayat shaayad hi ho
 Pappu remained humble and soft-spoken from outside during his long spell in jail
 yahi vah gun he, jo unke saath tab se he, jab unki tuuti bolaa karti thi
 But despite all this introspection, few things have not left the pursuit of Pappu Yadav
 ateet kii kaali parachhaaiyaan ab bhi unki smritiyon par mandara rahi hai
 Due to which they remain restless and have suffered from sleeplessness
 vah din main chaar ghante se zyada mushkil se hi so pate hai
 For the last two years, he has been in Beur jail and at the same time he has met his growing children
 ve nahin chaahate ki unke bachche unhen jail main dekhen
 Their six-year-old daughter does not even know they are in jail
 pappu is par itnaa hi kehete hai, ''bhagwaan dushman ko bhi kabhi ye din na dikhaae''

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) June 16, 2018 dilli ke congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne petrol or dijal ke bade daamon ko lekar centre kii bijepi or dilli kii aam aadmi party (AAP) par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He blamed BJP and AAP for skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel
 dilli ke congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kaha ki jab bijepi or aam aadmi party kii sarkaron ko ek-duusare kaa hit sadhana hota he, to donon haath mila leti hai
 He said that both the parties are responsible for the increased prices of petrol and diesel
 ajay maakan ne kaha ki agarpetrol or dejalpar bijepi kii centre sarkaar dwaara nau baar badhaai gai exise duty or aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar dwaara do baar badhaai gai waite kii daron ko hataa diya jaae, to rashtriya rajdhani dilli main petrol or dijal kii keemat 40-45 rupee prati litre ho jaaengi
 He said that by increasing the prices of petrol and diesel, PM Modi wants to directly benefit the refinery run by his friends
 desh kii janata kii khun-paseene kii kamai se modi ke mitron kii jeb bhari ja rahi he
 Maken said that the bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly on 30 June 2015 by the AAP party for the second amendment to the Delhi Value Added Tax, which was also approved by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi on 10 July 2015 i
e
 in 10 days this amendment Was also approved
 unhone kaha ki is sanshodhan ke chauthe shadul mempetroleum padaarthonpar waite kii dar 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat kar di gai
 VAT rates on oil prices were raised in Delhi in connivance with both the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP, due to which the prices of petrol and diesel have also increased
 yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab ajay maakan ne dilli kii aam aadmi party or centre kii bijepi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Earlier, he has also taken out a cycle rally against the Modi government over the increased prices of petrol and diesel
 is raily main congressi netaaon, parshadon or kaaryakartaaon ne badi sankhya main hissaa liya thi
 During this time, there were fierce slogans against the Modi government
 haalanki congress ke tamaam virodh ke baavjood abhi tak petrol or dijal ke daam kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 However, the Modi government is talking of giving relief soon
 empi main nahin hoga SC-ST act kaa durupyog, bina jaanch ke nahin hogi giraftaari
 In this season of dengue chikungunya, you read a lot about the lack of medicines, lack of space in hospitals and the visits of ministers and leaders outside Delhi, but there is another side to it
 aapako bataate hai kuch aise doctoron ke bare main jo khud biimaar hai lekin bimaaron kii timaardaari ke liye apni beemaari darkinar kar chuke hai
 The motive is just how to provide relief to the patients
 duty owers kii parvaah nahimbabu jagjivan ram aspataal main medicine vibhaag ke echodi doctor avinaash marijon kii timaardaari main vyast hai
 Forgetting all his troubles
 dow
 Avinash himself has a fever but does not even care about duty hours to cure his patients with fever by taking medicines
 badi baat ye ki privet doctoron kii tarah dengue-malaria-chikungunia kaa mausam in jaise sarkari doctoron ke liye kamai kaa mausam nahin he, inke liye sirf ek motiveshan he apane pesheynt ko har haal main thik karnaa
 Dr
 Avinash says that 'many offers from private hospitals have come, and continue to come, but the satisfaction of staying here to serve those people who come here due to lack of resources is nowhere else
 ham to apana kartavya bhar kar rahe hai
 'the vacancy was already canceled before the government's order,' Ms MS doctorsc Bhogal, deputy of Dambiyambu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, said that the Delhi government has sent the order to cancel the holiday a day in advance, but already all the staff can cancel their vacations and put them in the care of patients
 Is thought
 aapako bataa den ki doctoron ke alaava tamaam paramedical staff kii chhuttiyaan bhi dilli sarkaar ne agle aadesh tak nirast kar di hai
 All government hospitals in Delhi are in bad shape and there is a situation like giving space to two patients on each bed
 khaas baat ye he ki chikitsakeey aapadaa kii is sthiti main aise chikitsak dilli ke saath khadey hai jo marijon kii takalif ke aage apni takalif ko kuch nahin samajhate hai

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has admitted that his team's confidence has been slightly shaken by a fifth consecutive defeat on foreign soil, but he is not desperate
 unhone kaha ki team india sidney main australia ke khilaaf mangalvaar se shuru hone ja rahe duusare test main damdaar vaapasi ke liye taiyaar he
 India suffered a 122-run defeat in the first Test match in Melbourne at the hands of Australia after suffering an embarrassing 0–4 loss to England last summer
 dhoni ne sidney match kii purv sandhya par kaha, isse yah (aatmavishvaas) thodaa prabhavit hua he, lekin ham toote nahin hai, kyonki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki vastav main kya hua or aap galatiyon se sikhte ho
 We are focusing on the positive aspects
 videshi sarajameen par hamane jo pichley paanch match ganvaae, unamem hamaare liye kai sakaaratmak baaten raheen
 "we need to improve as a unit rather than just improving batting and bowling," he said
 england kii tarah yahaan hamen choton se nahin jujhna pad rahaa he, jo hamaare liye sakaaratmak pahalu he
 The Australian team will try to keep the pressure on our batting line-up and the same applies to bowlers
 jab dhoni se poocha gaya ki kya sachin tendulkar ke bahupratikshit 100wein antarrashtriya shatak se team kaa dhyaan bant rahaa he, unhone kaha, isse media kaa dhyaan banta hua he, jo hamaare liye acha he
 Wherever we go, people talk about this
 team ke rup main chaahate hai ki vah jald se jald ise hasil karen
 The truth is that this is a huge achievement and we would like to be a part of it and enjoy it
 bhartiya captain ne kaha ki sachin kisi bhi samay yah uplabdhi hasil kar sakate hai or aisa nahin lagata he ki isamen ho rahi deree se vah kisi tarah prabhavit hai
 Dhoni said, we all know that this century will definitely be scored
 yah is test match main ho saktaa he yaa agle match yaa is shrunkhlaa main
 You can't stop this from happening
 mujhe nahin lagata ki vah is bare main zyada soch rahe hai
 He said, of course the sooner he achieves this, the so-called pressure on him will be less, because the pressure is of failure and performance
 pradarshan kaa dabaav ho saktaa he, lekin vah vastav main is bare main baat nahin karte or kabhi aisa nahin lagata ki un par 100wein shatak kaa dabaav he
 Dhoni said that in case of winning the toss, the decision to bat or bowl will be made by looking at the pitch before the match
 unhone kaha, yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki match se pehle wicket kaisaa dikhataa he
 If there is moisture on the wicket and there are clouds in the sky and it seems that even after the first session, such a situation will prevail, then we will decide to bowl, but before deciding, we would like to see the morning wicket
 unhone kaha, wicket par hari ghaas ke sanket mil rahe hai
 Initially this can help the fast bowlers
 iske baad yah ballebaaji ke liye anukool hogi
 i cannot say for sure, but later this may give a turn, but it will depend on how much roller is driven on the wicket
 dhoni ne kaha ki bharat ne bhi australian ballebaajon ke liye ranneeti banaai he
 a similar claim was made by the Australian captain Michael Clarke for the Indian batsmen
 dhoni se yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya unhen harbhajan singh kii kami khal rahi he
 He was also questioned about giving up the catch of Rahul Dravid, considered safe in the slip
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ham unke (dravid ke) pradarshan se khush hai
 He is one of our best catchers
 cricket main aap kabhi kuch kaich chhod dete ho, lekin aap lagaataar acha pradarshan karte ho to aapako slip se baahar rakhane kaa koi kaaran nahin hona chahie
 The number six position has been a problem for India and Dhoni will have to choose between Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for this number
 unhone kaha, vah acha ballebaaj he or usne acchhee taiyaari kii he
 He needs to regain rhythm, so there is nothing wrong
 ummid he ki vah ran banayega
 Dhoni admitted that his batsmen would have to give up the balls that went out from 15 to 20 overs initially
 unhone kaha, kukabura gend shuruaati 15 se 20 overon main kaaphi gul khilaa sakati he, isliye of stump se baahar jaati gendon ko chhodane se madad mil sakati he, lekin aap virendra sahvaag ko yah baat nahin kah sakate, jinhen aisi gendon ke dhurre udaane main majaa aata he
 Dhoni said, "but it is always good for the opener to drop the ball and we will have to work on it, but i will say again that you would not like Sehwag to leave too much ball, which is very much dependent on the cut shot
" opening hamaare liye mahatvapurn he or ham chaahate hai ki ve bada score khadaa karen

 The problem arose regarding coal-based power generation
 lekin sarkaar ne is ore bijli sankat se paar paane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 100 days later, Energy Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said that the supply of coal is not low and dry fuel-based power generation has increased by nearly 22 per cent during the three months of the Narendra Modi-led government
 bijli or koyala mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki bijli gharon main koyale kii kami kaa kaaran atyadhik bijli utpaadan ke liye teji se bhandar kaa istemaal hona he
 Goyal said, "the supply of coal is not low
 pichley kuch saal main koyale kii nikasi yojana ke mutabik he
 The reality is that we have inherited no increase in coal production
 ' unhone aage kaha ki 100 din main koyale kaa utpaadan nahin badha saktaa, lekin sachaai yah he ki uplabdh sansadhano se bijli aapurti main 22 fisad kii vruddhi hui he or ye sabhi bijlighar koyala aadhaarit hai
 While the UP government itself was responsible, Piyush Goyal discussed the efforts of the central government for work in the power sector, while Akhilesh government was responsible for the power crisis in Uttar Pradesh
 urja mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki centre puri madad ke liye taiyar he, lekin rajya kii ore se sahyog nahin mil rahaa he
 Goyal said that there is no restriction on the power theft in UP

 It is to be noted that recently, the Supreme Court on coal allocation had said that coal mines were allocated illegally and arbitrarily since 1993 during various central governments
 court ke faisle se 218 koyala khaanon or kareeb 2 lakh karod rupee ke nivesh par anischitata ke badal chaa gaye
 Committed for 24-hour power supply, it is said that till September 4, 28 power houses of the country had less than four days of coal left
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki saarvajanik kshetra kii kol india khaanon se teji se koyale kii dhulaai ke liye 250 rail rack kharidne ke liye 5,000 karod rupee kharch karegi
 He said that the government is committed to transform the electricity sector and provide 24 hours power to all houses, industries and commercial units as well as adequate power for agriculture
 goyal ne kaha ki sarkaar koyala utpaadan badhaane ko lekar sabhi prayaas kar rahi he or chhattisgarh, jharkhand va odisha main teen mahatvapurn rail linon ko teji se puraa karne ke liye kadam uthaaye ja rahe hai
 This is expected to supply 60 million tonnes by 2017-18 and an additional 200 million tonnes of coal annually by 2021-22
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar koyala khanan pariyojnaon ke liye teji se paryaavaran manjuuri sunishchit karegi
 It will also take steps for environmental protection
 koyale kii vyavastha ko yuktisangat banane kii baat karte hue koyala mantri ne kaha 32,000 megawatt kshamta ke puraane bijligharon ko aadhunik rup diya jayega
 New steps for gas-based capacity Piyush Goyal said that several steps have been taken to address the stuck gas-based capacity and plans are made to use gas to meet the demand in peak hours or when needed
 mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar ne rajyon main bijli grid suraksha main 7,000 karod rupee nivesh kiye hai
 Goyal said the government has inherited many problems in the power sector
 30 karod se adhik bharatiyon ke paas bijli nahin pahunchi he
 This has impacted health, education and income growth opportunities

 On Wednesday, the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Bill in Lok Sabha passed the unlawful activities prevention amendment act (UAPA) after voting
 is bill ke paksh main 287 jabaki vipaksh main mahaj 8 vot pade
 Speaking in favor of the bill, Home Minister Amit Shah said that we need a strong law against terror
 duusari ore, congress ke saansad adheer ranjan choudhary ne yuapie vidheyak ko standing cameti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii to AIMIM saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki yah bill sanvaidhanik adhikaron ke hanan kaa adhikaar detaa he, kisi ko shaq yaa sarkaar ke kehane par aatanki ghoshit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, the Biju Janata Dal supported this bill
 sarkaar jahaan yuapie bill ke saath khadi he to ovaisi iskaa baari virodh kar rahe hai
 After all, what important provisions are being made in UAPA, which the opposition is opposing
 or kade ho jaaenge niyaghmit shah ne 8 july ko yuapie bill loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha
 This exercise is believed to curb the growing terrorism through the bill
 yuapie bill ke tahat centre sarkaar kisi bhi sanghathan ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kar sakati he agar nimna 4 main se kisi ek main use shaamil paaya jaataa he

 aatanki gatividhiyon main kisi anya tarah kii sanliptatiske alaava yah vidheyak sarkaar ko yah adhikaar bhi detaa he ki iske aadhaar par kisi ko bhi vyaktigat taur par aatankwaadi ghoshit kar sakati he
 The nia's strength will increase The Bill also gives unlimited powers to the National Investigation Agency (NIA)
 ab tak ke niyam ke mutabik ek jaanch adhikari ko aatankwaad se jude kisi bhi maamle main sampatti sij karne ke liye police mahanideshak (dijipi) se anumati leni hoti thi, lekin ab yah vidheyak is baat kii anumati detaa he ki agar aatankwaad se jude kisi maamle kii jaanch enie kaa koi afasar karata he to use iske liye sirf enie ke mahanideshak se anumati leni hogi
 After the new proposed amendments, the Director General of NIA will now get the right to take possession and attach properties which were used in terrorist activities
 ab iske liye enie ko rajya ke police mahanideshak se anumati lene kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The inspector will also be able to investigate the investigation, the strength of the NIA has increased further
 ab tak ke niyam ke anusaar, aise kisi bhi maamle kii jaanch dipti suparitendent of police (dspi) yaa assistant kamishnar of police (asipi) rank ke adhikari hi kar sakate the
 But now, according to the new rule, the NIA officers have been given more powers
 ab aise kisi bhi maamle kii jaanch inspector rank yaa usase upar ke afasar kar sakate hai
 Home Minister Amit Shah endorsed the amendment bill, saying that stricter and much tougher legislation is needed to curb terrorism
 aaj congress kanoon main sanshodhan kaa virodh kar rahi he jabaki 1967 main indira gandhi kii sarkaar hi yah kanoon lekar ai thi
 Under the new changes in UAPA, the NIA will have unlimited powers
 vah aatanki gatividhiyon main shaq ke aadhaar par logon ko uthaa sakegi, saath hi sanghathanon ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kar un par karrwai kar sakati he
 Also, the NIA had to first get permission from the police of the concerned state for investigation, but it will no longer be needed, so a crackdown may occur and the opposition fears that this will increase the arbitrariness of the NIA and cause problems to the minority community May have to face
 pakistan kii hukumat, vahaan kii suraksha agenciyaan, hindustan main aatanki sajeesh kii sabase badi sutaradhar iesai sab kulbhushan jadhav naam ke shaks ko bharat kaa jasoos qaraar dene par tule hai, jabaki hakeekat kuch or hi he
 The Pakistani army and government held a press conference a day earlier and released a video of the confession stating the man as an agent of RAW, but the investigation of 'aaj Tak' revealed layers of Pakistan's white lies
 pakistan kaa pehla jhooth-pehla or sabase bada jhooth to pakistan neculbhushan kii giraftaarko lekar hi bolaa he
 Balochistan Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti claims that Kulbhushan was arrested from Chaman, while the Pakistani Army claims that he was arrested from Saravanan
 chaman iraan, pakistan, or afghanistan seemaa par he, jabaki saravan iran main
 The distance between the two cities is also not small but 873 kilometers
 sawaal he ki kulbhushan kii giraftaar hui to kahaan se? giraftaar par do tarah ke bayanon se saaf he ki daal main kuch naa kuch kaala he
 Two locations of arrest were reported and both have a difference of hundreds of kilometers
 kuch usee tarah jaise giraftaar patna main ho or kaha jaae ki giraftaar dilli main hui he
 If you look closely at Pakistan's second lie-video, it is clear that this video has been tampered with
 agar koi shaks giraft main ho to usase jabaran kuch bhi kabool karvaa lenaa kitna aasaan he, ye samajhnaa zyada mushkil nahin he
 Third lie of Pakistan - Pakistan has woven such a large fabric of lies that it got entangled in itself
 yahaan tak ki kulbhushan jadhav kii giraftaar kii taarikh ko lekar bhi pakistan ke jhooth kii puri kalai khul gai
 Pakistan's dawahi that Kulbhushan was arrested on March 3, then Pakistan will also have to answer the question why did he reveal his arrest on March 24? Why did the horoscope of silence sit on Kulbhushan's arrest for three weeks? Pakistan's fourth lie - Pakistan also claims that Kulbhushan was in contact with someone named Satyaprakash in Bluechistan and Karachi, but security agencies give full information about him
 Why is Pakistan's fifth falsehood - what could be a greater proof of Pakistan's malfeasance and deceit Indian embassy officials are not being allowed to meet the Kulbhusn
 saaf he ki pakistan bharat ko badnaam kar rahaa he or sach saamne nahin aane dena chahta

 Book excerpt: Arms farewell: There was a strong storm that night and on waking i heard rain injuries on the window panes
 khuli khidki se barish andar aa rahi thi
 Someone knocked on the door

 ''mujhe kyon giraftaar kar rahe hai?’’''yuddh ke bare main kuch he
 "" "you know what that is?" "" No, but i know that he knew that you were an officer here before and now you are walking around in plain clothes
 is 'vaapasi’ ke baad vah sabhi ko pakad rahe hai
 "I kept thinking for a minute
 ''mujhe pakadaney ke liye vah kis vakt aayenge?’’''subah, samay kaa mujhe pataa nahin
 "" Tell me what should i do? "" He put his hat in the wash-basin
 hat kaaphi bhigaa hua tha or usamen se boonden farsh par tapak rahi thim
 "if you are not afraid, then nothing will happen from arrest
" lekin giraftaar hona bura to he hi, vah bhi aise halaat main

 "" What's the matter? "" The barman is saying that he is going to arrest me in the morning
 ’’''kya barman pagal he?’’''nahin
 "" Then hurry up, Darling

 "she sat on the corner of the bed, still feeling sleepy
" ''kya barman bathroom main he?’’''haan
 "" Then i will not wash my hands and face

 "when she took off her night-gown, i caught a glimpse of her white back and then looked the other way because she wanted to
" bachche ke kaaran uskaa vajan thodaa bad rahaa tha or vah nahin chaahati thi ki main uski ore dekhun
 i dressed while listening to the sound of rain on the window
 bag main rakhane ke liye mere paas kuch khaas nahin tha
 "there is plenty of space in my bag, Kat, if you want to keep something
" ’’''maine sara rakh liya he
 "he said," Darling, I'm so stupid, but why is this barman inside the bathroom? "" Shhh
 
 
 vah ham logon ke bag neeche le jayega
 "" That's very good
 ’’''purana dost he vah
 "I said," i almost once sent him a little tobacco
 ’’maine khuli hui khidki se andheri raat ko dekha

 ''okay

 'emilio, the bags are here

 The barman took both bags
 ''tum bahut achche ho jo hamaari madad kar rahe ho

 "said Catherine
" ''kitni bekaar raat he

 We left the hall

 He was surprised to see us
 ''aap baahar to nahin ja rahe hai, sar?’’ usne poocha
 ''yes

 "he was the second concierge and his English was completely translated
" ''ham laut aayenge

 bada chaataa lagaae hue ham raste se neeche aae or pani bhare hue baag se sadak par aa gaye
 Then we crossed the road and reached the jagged path along the lake
 hawa ab tat se dur kii ore chal rahi thi
 It was a rainy November and very cold
 mujhe pataa tha ki pahaado main barf gir rahi thi
 From the tied boats we walked to the pier where the barman's boat was likely to be
 pathar ke ghat ke paas pani kaala sa tha
 The barman comes out from behind the queues of trees
 ''bag naav main rakhe hai
 '' he told
 ''main naav ke liye paise dena chahta hoon

 ''kitna paisa he aapke paas?’’''bahut zyada nahin

 input language input- bhashaa Raising voice against officials working on fake SC certificate, RTI activist Rajendra Singh committed suicide due to costly, threatening threats and on the one hand, the Right to Information (RTI) has emerged as a weapon against corruption and the other And through this, death has become a cause for those who disclose irregularities
 madhya pradesh main bhopal ke artiai kaaryakarta 45 varshiya rajendra singh rajput kaa kissa kuch aisa hi sabit hua
 What he disclosed to the officials doing government jobs by making fake Scheduled Caste Certificates through RTI, their troubles increased
 un afasaron ne kathith taur par unhen itnaa zyada tang kiya ki unhone beete 15 aktubar ko pradesh ke mukhya sachiv antni disa ke daftar ke saamne aatmahatya kar lee
 The case started in 2006 when Rajendra allegedly got information about 300 people doing government jobs on fake caste certificates under RTI
 artiai main unhone paaya ki ye sabhi khud ko od beldaar jati kaa bataate hue sarkari naukari kar rahe hai
 But most of these Oeds are reportedly from Rajput caste
 od rajput jati pradesh main obisi main aati he jabaki od beldaar jati anusuchit jati main
 Rajendra himself belongs to this Od Rajput caste
 artiai se jinke naam mili, un adhikariyon ne kathith taur par farji anusuchit jati pramaan patr banavaa liya tha or har tarah se anusuchit jati cote kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 He filed a petition in 2009 complaining about this in the High Court as well
 rajendra ne un adhikariyon kii shikaayat sarkaar ke aalaa afasaron se bhi kii or iske liye jaruri saboot bhi pesh kiya
 But Shivraj Singh Chauhan government and his administrative officials paid no attention to it
 un adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai hone kii bajaae rajendra kii hi museebataan bad gayi
 They started getting threats and beatings
 kathith taur par farji pramaan patr ke jariye naukari paane waalon main se 33 adhikariyon ne unhen dhamkaana shuru kar diya
 In connivance with the police, some officers lodged fake cases for alleged fraud, illegal recovery
 haryana ke sonipat main bhi un par ek adhikari shailendra khambara ne manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karavaaya he
 Despite all this, Rajendra was not scared and complained about the threats to the administrative officers
 unhone isi saal mukhya sachiv, dijipi or iji (sibar cell) ko dhamkiyaan milane or pareshaan kiye jane kii shikaayat kii thi
 But lice will not linger on the ears of the government and responsible administrative officials
 rajendra kii patni rajani bataati hai, ''kai baar kuch log hamaare ghar der raat dhamkee dene aate the or hamaare khilaaf thane main juthi shikaayatein darj karai gayi
 His (rajendra's) life was in danger and many times the officers were told about this
 lekin koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Rajendra was ultimately disappointed in his battle from all sides
 isse pehle unhone dijipi nandan dube, kuch media sansthaanon or apane parichiton ko esemes ke jariye soochna di thi ki ve aatmahatya karne ja rahe hai
 He went to meet the Chief Secretary, but did not get a chance to meet him
 iske baad unhone sulphas kha liya
 They were unconscious by the time the police arrived
 vallabh bhawan main mukhyamantri ke saath hi pradesh ke zyaadaatar aalaa afasar baithte hai
 He was rushed to a nearby hospital after consuming poison
 vahaan se unhen hamidia aspataal bhej diya gaya
 He died while undergoing treatment in this hospital
 rajani unki maut ke liye sarkaar ke udasin ravaie ko jimmedaar maanati hai
 She says, "my husband would not have to commit suicide if the government had taken timely action against people doing jobs on the basis of fake caste certificates
 '' adhikariyon ne doshi logon ko bachaaya or isi vajah se pareshaan hokar mere pati ne rajya mantralay main mukhya sachiv ke kamare ke saamne jehar kha liya
 Rajendra has written a 23-page suicide note before he dies
 isamen unhone un adhikariyon ke naam kaa ullekh kiya he jo unhen lagaataar pratadit kar rahe the

 Former PM Manmohan Singh spoke on the government's economic policies
 Former Governor Raghuram Rajan has also raised the government's policies
 On Thursday, former Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh ne bhartiya arthvyavastha ko lekar modi sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has now retaliated on Manmohan Singh's statement
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha, “main aarope-pratyarope main nahin ulajhane kii baat kehane ke liye manmohan singh ji kaa sammaan karti hum, lekin kisi baat kaa sandarbh samajhane ke liye kisi khaas avadhi kaa zikr karnaa jaruri hota he
 One must remember when and what went wrong in that period
 ” nirmala sitaraman ne ye bayaan purv piem manmohan singh ke un aaropon par diya he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar samaadhaan dhundne kii bajaae hameshaa apane pratidwandviyon par dosha madhne kii koshish karti he
 Where did the rhetoric start? Actually, a few days ago former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan attacked the economic policies of the government during a lecture abroad
 raghuram rajan ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ke paas koi vijan nahin he or na hi kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Along with this, Rajan said that the economy has suffered a setback due to decisions like demonetisation and GST
 iske baad rajan kii is aalochana kaa vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne jawaab diya
 During a lecture at Columbia University, he said that during the tenures of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and PM Manmohan Singh, the condition of the state's public banks reached a worse position
 iske saath hi unhone aarope lagaaya ki is daur main sirf ek phone kol par lone de die jate the
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to answer these allegations of Nirmala Sitharaman
 beete guuruuvaar ko unhone kaha ki agar hamaari sarkaar (upie sarkaar) ke dwaara banking ke kshetra main kuch galtiyaan hui hai, to phir modi sarkaar ko usase kuch siikhnaa chahie tha
 But if you look at Nirav Modi's case, he escaped, but the government is blaming others
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki sirf duusare par aarope lagane se hi musiibat kaa hal nahin nikalegaa, ye hamane pichley paanch saal main dekha he
 Nirmala Sitharaman has responded to this statement of Manmohan Singh
 desh kii arthvyavastha ab bhi sabase tejiske saath hi nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki bharat vishwa kii sarvaadhik teji se viksit hoti arthvyavasthaaon main se ek he or ise or teji se viksit karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Sitharaman said that in the latest IMF report, the growth rate of both India and China is 6
 1 fisadi rahane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he, lekin vah nishchit hi china ke saath tulana nahin karengi
 He said, "the IMF has (in its recent estimate) reduced the growth rate for all the world's economies
 isane bharat ke liye vikaas anumaan kam kar diya he
 Despite this, India is still growing as the fastest growing economy

 Alliances are underway across the country
 satta ke sheersh par pahunchane ke liye endie or upie apni puri takat laga rahe hai, saath hi kshetreey dal bhi apana-apana daanv aajamaa rahe hai
 In most states, the alliance between the parties has been ratified and seats have been divided among them, but in Bihar there is a situation of seat-sharing among the UPA constituents
 'jab tak rahegaa samose main aalu tab tak rahegaa bihar main lalu', nabbe ke dashak ke is naare kii dhamak 2009 or 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon ke nateezon ke saath hi feeki si padane lagi
 If we take only the 2014 data as the basis, then in 2019, the NDA alliance once again seems to be overshadowing the UPA alliance
 vartmaan endie main bijepi or algepi ke alaava nitish kumaar kii jad (you) ko 2014 main mili vot ko aadhaar banaae to endie, upie se bahut aage jaataa dikhataa he
 Vote percentage of Bihar's current NDA (BJP + LJP + JD (U) and UPA (congress + RJD + Left + RLSP + NCP) based on votes polled in 2014 Lok Sabha elections) Note: All figures are in percent; Data source: ECI_2014; Left: CPI + CPI (M) + CPI (ML) In the 2014 election where the contest was triangular, this time the situation is changing
 pichley baar jediu, bijepi or argedy gathbandhan ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 The BJP benefited directly from this, in the Modi wave, the BJP along with LJP and RLSP won 31 out of 40 seats
 is baar bhi endie ko sabase zyada phayda jediu ke saath aane se ho rahaa he, lekin yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle hi nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye narendra modi ke naam kaa virodh kar endie se kinaaraa kar liya tha or bijepi ne nitish virodh ke naam par chunaav ladaa tha
 If based on 2014 figures and add to the votes of the current alliance, in 2019, the NDA coalition can save 21 out of 22 seats of BJP, six seats of LJP and two of JDU but also Lalu Yadav's RJD (rashtriya Janata Dal) The seats won by Araria, Banka, Bhagalpur and Madhepura can also be a threat
 2014 main argedy ne 40 main se sirf in 4 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In 2014, Janata Dal United won two seats while contesting alone, while in four seats it stood second and 29 seats in third place
 jediu ke endie main aa jane se congress kii do main se ek supaul seat or upendra kushvaha kii party araspi kii karacat seat par bhi endie majboot daavedaari pesh kar sakati he
 The RLSP won two seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha
 india today kii data intelligence unit (diaiu) ne bihar kii 40 siton par pichley chunaavon main pade voton kii padtaal kii
 We have based the data on a possible change in vote shares according to the equation of the new coalition
 is padtaal ke baad ye anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jediu ke aane se bihar main endie gathbandhan ko badi majbootee milane ja rahi he
 However, if Communist parties or BSP are involved in the Grand Alliance, then some seats may see vicissitudes
 voton ke lihaaj se dekhen to jithan maanjhi kii nai party ‘ham’ or upendra kushvaha kii party ke mahagathbandhan main aane se do siton par maamuli badlaav ho saktaa he
 Despite all these equations, if Nitish Kumar and BJP manage to get their votes transferred to each other, then the NDA may get success in 35 out of 40 seats, though in ten of these seats the case is very close
 yahaan ke jaateey sameekaran or ummidavaaron kaa chayan bhi ek badi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 The existing seats of LJP are likely to face stiff competition in Samastipur, jdu's Nalanda and bjp's Begusarai, Madhubani, Saran, Jhanjharpur, Sasaram, Aurangabad, Khagaria and Ujiarpur seats
 haalanki party ko bhagalpur, darbhanga, gaya, gopalganj, hajipur, jamui or jhanjharpur jaisi siton par jediu ke saath kaa sidhaa phayda mil saktaa he jahaan bijepi kii jeet kaa antar kam tha
 It is also true that the factor of anti-incumbency is also associated with Nitish Kumar
 bijepi ko phaayde ke saath-saath nitish kumaar ke saath kaa nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 The most important thing about Bihar elections is that almost all the parties that won the previous elections, be it BJP, RJD, Janata Dal United or Congress, all had vote share of more than 30 percent
 bijepi ramvilas paswan kii algepi ke saath milakar chunaav ladate hue 22 siton par jeet kii thi jabaki algepi 7 siton par ladate hue 6 par jeet hasil kiya tha
 RJD was second in 27 seats, but JDU, which contested the 2014 elections alone, could win only 2 seats
 har chunaav alag hota he or har chunaav kii taasir bhi alag hoti he
 Today, RJD supremo is serving sentence in fodder scam in Ranchi jail and hospitals, command is in the hands of son Tejashwi
 tejasvi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ek-duusare kaa saath to de rahe hai lekin siton kaa bantwaaraa khabar likhe jane tak nahin paaya he
 Both the leaders have opened their front against Prime Minister Modi and CM Nitish Kumar and their victory in the by-elections is also encouraging
 bijepi ke liye badi chunauti uttar pradesh se lage bihar kii baxur seat ko bachaana he
 While Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal was second in the last elections and there was a difference of around fourteen per cent in the vote share, but in the third place was the BSP candidate whose vote share was twenty per cent, ie slightly less than the RJD
 agar bispi argedy ke saath gathbandhan kar leti he to bijepi ke liye is seat ko bachaana mushkil ho saktaa he
 Apart from Buxar, seats like Jehanabad, Katihar, Kishanganj, Sitamarhi can remain in the upa's account
 in paanch main se do siten- jahanabad or sitamarhi upendra kushvaha kii party araspi ke paas he
 The RLSP contested the 2014 election together with the NDA
 ab upendra kushvaha lalu yadav ke netritv vaale mahagathbandhan main shaamil hai
 It is also true that before joining NDA in 2014, Upendra Kushwaha was a regional leader who did not have any special identity, but riding on the Modi wave, he not only reached Parliament but was made a Union Minister and he was well recognized as a Minister
 It has become
 ab kushvaha modi ke khilaaf hai or unke saamne is baat kii chunauti he ki wo apane votbank ko saadh kar rakh saken
 The three major parties of the NDA have announced the names of the candidates for 2019
 bijepi or janata dal united 17-17 siton par jabaki paswan kii party 6 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Elections are going to be held in a total of seven phases in Bihar

 However, the EPFO management has decided to invest only five per cent of its incremental deposits in etfs during the current financial year
 tippaniyan Regarding the size of the investment, Jalan said, i do not even know
 yah bazaar par nirbhar karegaa
 As per the norms of the Finance Ministry, we can invest up to 15 per cent of the amount raised every month, but the CBT (central Board of Trustees) has initially given us approval to invest only five per cent of it
 april se june kii avadhi main ipiefo kaa masik vruddhi parak jamaa kareeb 8,200 karod rupee he
 So the organization will have around 410 crore rupees for investment every month

 paanchave bowler kaa kaam karenge dhoni ke favorit ipel met sar ravindra jadeja
 There is an all-rounder-factor argument about his involvement
 ab baat karen ballebaaji order kii
 Dhoni lays great emphasis on the specialist and in such a situation, it is likely that Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan start the innings
 haalanki vijay kii parformens na to ipel or na hi van de cricket yaa warsop maichon main thik rahi he, magar test ke shatak unke kaam aa rahe hai
 Now comes the middle order
 isamen dinesh karthik kaa naam tay he
 He can come down first
 thik usee role main jo unhone ipel main mumbai indiens ke liye nibhaayaa
 Virat Kohli's name is fixed on this number or second down
 aise main dhoni ke baad bachi sirf ek jagah, jiske daavedaar hai, do, raina or rohit
 Both of them had a good form in the IPL and both were flopped in warm-up matches
 aise main dhoni duvidha main hai
 Fielding is also the best of both
 andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki dhoni apane siesake met raina ko hi team main rakhenge or philhal rohit ko bainch par hi baithna hoga

 upie cheirperson soniyaan gandhi ne 23 may ko vipakshi dalon kii baithak bulaai he
 This meeting is reminiscent of 2004 when Sonia Gandhi called a meeting of opposition parties after the election results were out
 us vakt wapamanthi dal kul 58 siton ke saath tisare number kii sabase badi party thi, jisane aanan-fanan main congress ke saath mil kar sarkaar banane kaa elaan kar tatkaaleen piem atal bihari vaajapeyi kii satta main vaapasi roak di
 In that election, the Congress could win only 7 seats more than the BJP
 haalanki chunaav se pehle vipakshi dalon kii ekajutata kii koi baat nahin thi or vaajapeyi ke mukaable rashtriya str kaa koi badi netaa vipakshi dalon ke paas bhi nahin tha
 It is worth noting that before the 2004 election results, the survey and exit poll were clearly predicting the bjp-led NDA
 sutron kaa kahana he ki chunaav nattejey aane se ek din pehle pramod mahajan, pradhanmantri vajayapi ko desh kaa nakshaa bataa kar yah bataane kii koshish kar rahe the ki bhaajapa is baar pehle ke mukaable zyada seat jeetne ja rahi he
 When Pramod finished his talk, Vajpayee had told him that, 'include boria-vistara, prepare to sit in the opposition
 ’ pramod is baat se sahamat nahin hue the lekin jab nateeja saamne aayaa to vaajapeyi kii baat sahi nikali
 It is more or less the same after 15 years

 The atmosphere that is in Bangla at this time (mamata's aggression) is exactly the same as the aggressive party back in Bengal against the BJP at that time
 is baar bhi zyaadaatar survey yahi sanket de rahe hai ki bhaajapa apane dam par bahumat praatt karne ja rahi he
 If not BJP then at least NDA will get a clear majority
 ek ahm baat yah bhi he ki us chunaav main endie sarkaar ke bahumat se dur rahane kii ek ahm vajah yah bhi rahi ki uske zyaadaatar sahyogi dal chunaav haar gaye the
 This time parties like Shiv Sena, JDU, LJP, AIADMK are partners of NDA
 lekin bihar main bhaajapa ko mahagathbandhan se majboot chunauti mil rahi he
 In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK is facing a tough challenge from the DMK
 maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena ko congress-ensipi se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 In such a situation, the possibility of NDA allies being reduced to just a few seats cannot be ruled out

 (agency se input) Refugees will fearlessly say that we are refugees: Shahshah said - not being given citizenship for the first time, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Wednesday that the Citizenship Amendment Bill will bring religious persecution and citizenship to three neighboring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh
 There is a silver lining for inaccessible minorities
 amit shah ne kaha ki is bill kii vajah se kai dharm ke pratadit logon ko bharat kinagariktamilegi lekin vipaksh kaa dhyaan sirf is baat par ki muslim ko kyon nahin lekar aa rahe hai
 Your secularism will be based only on Muslims, but our secularism is not based on any one religion

 "the NDA government has clarified that Muslims are the majority in these three countries, stating the reason behind exclusion of Muslims from this bill
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki in deshon main muslimon kaa dharmik aadhaar par utpeedan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki in deshon main ye bahusankhyak hai
 To take away the rights of minorities, Amit Shah said, the rights of minorities living in Pakistan and Afghanistan were taken away

 Jayalalithaa may seem like a myth to the viewers of North India who live politics more than life, but she is not just a myth for the public of Tamil Nadu
 ek aisi hakeekat hai jo uttar kii nigaah se dur chupchaap apane khite main badi hoti chali gayi jiske saamne uttar bharat kaa bada se bada mahanayake maamuli lagata rahaa
 The reason for this is that while the great Indian of North India becomes a great hero from the west to the east, but this state of the south has its destiny to become an assistant
 chennai se aane vaali har tasviir yahi bataa rahi he ki koi unke dilon par raaj karata he
 This is not just emotional sentiment
 ham sab ko bhavukta lag sakati he lekin bhavukta kshanik hoti he
 In politics, it gets a little long, but when the sentiment becomes so long that more than forty-five years pass, it should not be seen only through the spectacles of sentimentality
 apollo aspataal ke baahar rote chehre sirf bhavukta ke pramaan nahin hai
 The heroine of the film screen would not have met Amma's title in politics only with emotion
 dakshin main parde se raajnneeti main to bahut aae lekin koi jayalalita nahin ban paaya
 MGR is ntr's own place but Jayalalithaa's position is bigger than hers in many ways
 jayalalita yahaan bhi uttar bharat ke siyaasi mahanayakon kii tarah uttar ke filmi mahanayakon ko maat de detii hai
 The big stars of Mumbai came into politics from films but could never achieve the status of more than playing Hazari and Salaam
 uttar ke mahanayake netaaon ke aage aage chalane ke liye abhishpt hai
 They may become brand ambassadors of government schemes but could never convert their film charisma into political capital

 Just as the leader sitting on the throne of Delhi is drunk in his boast, Jayalalithaa has come in secret and twisted her ear

 Otherwise you will not be judged with his political contributions

 For example, insisting a director is insisting on changing the script according to his own ability

 The doctors have left Delhi
 ham samaj sakate hai ki is vakt sabake liye kitna mushkil he
 How frightening it would be to stand in front of a whirlwind of emotions and complete medical duty, keeping it in that form, fearing to come out like a criminal in front of them with their limitations
 aap kalpana kiijie jayalalita ke aas paas jamaa doctoron par kya guzar rahi hogi
 He is expected to be God today but he is taught that doctor is not God
 wo to bas ilaaj karata he, bachaata koi or he
 We also have a challenge for newsmen as to what is the right news
 kab ho
 In the race to give the news a little pause, or in the race to give first, let us crush the feelings of millions of people who are already restless
 apane kaabo main nahin hai
 It should be that there is no limit to the emotions between presenting the news and listening to it, but sometimes you have to take care
 ratlam, sikar, jalon, banaras, bhagalpur, rewadi, chamba, kullu ke darshak aaj tamilnadu ke zilon main pasri udaasi ko kaise mahasoos karenge

 Lawyer wants to become a doctor, mother takes him to films
 filmon se raajnneeti main ajey ban jaati hai
 Jayalalithaa
 raajnneeti ko hameshaa sukhi aalochanaon or naaron se mat dekhiye
 For Jayalalithaa, this attachment is not the result of managers handling the tweeters in the rooms in the back of the headquarters of political parties coming from Delhi to Delhi
 unki party kaa twitor handle to farvari 2014 main hi bana
 Won 37 seats out of 39
 aap us vakt ke dilli se nikalne vaale tamaam akhabaaron kaa vishleshan dekhiyegaa, jayalalita or naveen patnayak ke bare main do line bhi thik se nahin milegi
 Naveen Patnaik won 20 out of 21 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tippaniyan Now a question arises that Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik broke the clout of national parties in their stronghold, but why they could not liberate Delhi from the political dominance of West and North India
 dakshin ke tamaam pratibhashali netaa apni daavedaari uttar bharat ke bich kyon nahin kar sake
 Jayalalithaa came to Delhi in 1984 as a member of Rajya Sabha
 jayalalita ne kanshiram kii tarah kisi mayawati kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya
 Did they think it was right to abandon the aiadmk's destiny? mjiaar bhi to kisi jayalalita ko viraasat saunp kar nahin gaye the
 How to remember Jayalalithaa's political success and her tenure as Chief Minister
 uttar bharat ke log kaise jaane ki tamilnadu kii is rajaneta ne satta main aakar rajya ko kaise badla or raajnneetik dal main apni haisiyat kaise banaai
 Jayalalithaa is assaulted in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989
 ve fatty sari pahanakar baahar aati hai or elaan karti hai ki mukhyamantri banakar hi sadan main lautengi
 Becomes Chief Minister five times
 1991 main jayalalita congress se milakar 234 main se 225 siten jeet jaati hai
 Exactly four years later, on June 2, 1995, an incident of assault with Mayawati takes place in a guest house in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 upi ne mayawati ko chaar baar mukhyamantri banaaya
 The attack also takes place on Mamta Banerjee
 bengal ne duusari baar ke liye mamata ko satta saunp di
 People of North India know about the devotee
 bhakt uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kaa wo tatv he jiskaa naam to bhakt he magar sanskaar bhakt ke nahin hai
 His language is abusive
 andh samarthan kii he
 To beat morrkhtaa kii he
 Being a devotee has become the leader's muscle in politics
 lekin dakshin bharat main netaaon kii is bhakthi ko kaise samajha jaae
 Can the crying people seen in the photos be called just supporters? samarthak ke peeche ke log koun hai
 Can we know jayalalita ne soshal media ke sahare inhen kora bhakt banaaya yaa inaki zindagi badal di or ye jaya ko samarpit ho gaye
 Every picture coming from Chennai is showing that someone rules their hearts
 yah mahaz kori bhavukta nahin he
 We all may feel emotional but emotionality is transitory
 raajnneeti main thodi lambii ho jaati he magar jab bhavukta itani lambii ho jaae ki chalis pantalis saal se bhi zyaada kaa lamhaa guzar jaae to use sirf bhavukta ke chashme se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Crying faces outside of Apollo Hospital are not just evidences of sentimentality
 filmi parde kii nayika ko raajnneeti main ammaa kaa kitaab sirf bhavukta se nahin mil jaataa hoga
 Many came to politics from the curtain in the south but no Jayalalithaa could be made
 mjiaar, antiaar kaa apana mukaam he lekin jayalalita kaa mukaam kai myanon main unase bhi bada he
 Jayalalithaa also here, like the political magnates of North India, defeats the film superstars of the north
 mumbai ke bade star filmon se raajnneeti main to aae magar kabhi ji huzuri or salaam bajaane se zyaada kii haisiyat hasil nahin kar sake
 The superiors of the north are cursed to go ahead of the leaders
 wo sarkari yojanaon ke brands ambesadkar to ban sakate hai lekin apni filmi karishma ko kabhi raajnneetik puunji main nahin badal sake
 Perhaps they do not have that much capability
 ve zyada se zyada chatukaarita hi kar sakate hai
 Jayalalithaa of the South moves ahead in politics by coming from films
 raajnneeti ko badal detii he
 She makes Delhi government fall by sitting in Chennai
 jaise dilli kii gaddi par baithe netaa apni shekhi main madamast ho, jayalalita ne chupake se aakar uski kaan marod di ho
 Go see Jayalalithaa with feelings
 varna unke siyaasi yogadan ke saath aap insaaf nahin karenge
 She has been struggling in the hospital since 22 September
 jaise kisi diarector ko ansuna kar screept ko apane hisaab se badalakar tech dene kii zid savaar ho
 Today, when South India is busy with fears related to the most important leaders of its time, the political group of North India, who is going to India, is tinkling like an empty vessel to say what to say
 sune to kya sunen
 The year of 1982 was Jayalalithaa's first political speech in Cuddalore
 aaayeidiemke main sab kuch hasil kiya
 She fought with opponents, being a woman, fought with shameless allegations, even fought opponents
 34 saal tak 235 vidhansabhaon vaali tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main paanch baar chunaav jeetna aasaan nahin rahaa hoga
 In 2014, when the North Indian media was announcing the all-india Modi wave, Jaya was in awe of 39 mps from Tamil Nadu, a state bordering the Arabian Sea
 39 main 37 siton par ediemke jeet hasil karti he
 We can understand the difficulties of Apollo Hospital
 jayalalita kii sthiti karaab he
 AKMO uses machines only when the situation is extremely critical
 duaen apane charam par hai
 Doctors are taking all kinds of caution
 ilaaj ko lekar bhi or jayalalita ko lekar kis tarah se samvaad kiya jaae, soochna kisi ho ise lekar bhi jujh rahe honge
 Talked to a London doctor
 dilli se doctor ravaanaa hue hai
 We can understand how difficult it is for everyone at this time
 jazbaaton ke bavandar ke saamne khadey hokar medical duty puraa karnaa, use us rup main rakh dena, apni simaaon ke saath unke saamne apradhi kii tarah baahar aane kaa dar kitna bhayaavah hoga
 Imagine what would be going on with the doctors deposited around Jayalalithaa
 unase aaj bhagwaan hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he magar unhen yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki doctor bhagwaan nahin he
 He just cures, someone else saves
 ham khabaranvison ke liye bhi chunauti he ki sahi khabar kya ho
 When are you thodi ruk kar khabar di jaae yaa pehle dene kii hode main ham un lakhon logon ke jazbaaton ko kured den jo pehle se hi baichaiyn hai
 Are not in their control hona to yahi chahie ki khabar pesh karne or use sunne ke bich bhaawanaaon kii koi seemaa na ho magar kai baar aapako khyaal karnaa padataa he
 How would the audience of Ratlam, Sikar, Jalaun, Banaras, Bhagalpur, Rewari, Chamba, Kullu feel the pessary sadness in the districts of Tamil Nadu today
 unka ankar to kabhi jayalalita se mila tak nahin he
 Never even touched Tamil politics
 paidaa hoti hai karnataka main lekin tamilnadu aakar kah detii hai ki main kannadiga nahin tamil hum
 The Ammu name of childhood changes to Amma
 vakil, doctor bananaa chaahati hai, maa filmon main le jaati hai
 Movies become invincible in politics
 jayalalita
 Do not always view politics with dry criticisms and slogans
 jayalalita ke liye yah lagaav harvard se dilli aakar raajnneetik dalon ke mukhyalayon ke peeche ke hisse main bane kamaron main twitor sambhaal rahe manageron kii dein nahin he
 The tweeter handle of his party was made only in February 2014
 39 main se 37 siten jiti
 You will see the analysis of all the newspapers coming out of Delhi at that time, two lines about Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik will not be found properly
 naveen patnayak ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 21 main se 20 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments ab ek sawaal uthta he ki jayalalita or naveen patnayak se apane garh main rashtriya dalon kaa vacharsv to tod diya lekin ve dilli ko pashchim or uttar bharat ke raajnneetik dabadabe se kyon nahin mukt kar sake
 Why could not all the talented leaders of South claim their claim among North India
 1984 main jayalalita rajyasabha kii sadsy banakar dilli to ain thim
 Why did Jayalalitha not choose any Mayawati like Kanshi Ram
 kya unhone ediemke kii niyati ko uske sahare chhodana thik samajha
 Even MGR did not hand over the legacy to any Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita kii raajnneetik kamyaabi or mukhyamantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ko kaise yaad kiya jaae
 How should the people of North India know how this politician from Tamil Nadu changed the state after coming to power and made his position in the political party
 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main jayalalita ke saath marpet hoti he
 She comes out wearing a torn sari and declares that she will return to the House only after becoming the Chief Minister
 paanch baar mukhyamantri banati hai
 In 1991, Jayalalithaa joins Congress to win 225 out of 234 seats
 thik chaar saal baad 2 june 1995 ko uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke guest house main mayawati ke saath marpet kii ghatana hoti he
 UP made Mayawati chief minister four times
 hamalaa mamata banerjee par bhi hota he
 Bengal ceded power to Mamata for the second time
 uttar bharat ke log bhakt ke bare main jaanate hai
 Devotee is that element of the politics of North India whose name is devotee but the rites are not of devotee
 uski bhashaa gaaliyon kii he
 Blind support
 maarane peetane kii he
 Is foolish
 bhakt hona siyasat main netaa kaa bahubali bananaa ho gaya he
 But how to understand this devotion of leaders in South India
 kya tasveeron main dikh rahe rote bilakhte log sirf samarthak kahe ja sakate hai
 Who are the people behind the pro
 kya ham jaan sakenge
 Jayalalithaa made her a Kora devotee with the help of social media or changed her life and she became devoted to Jaya
 dakshin main parde se raajnneeti main to bahut aae lekin koi jayalalita nahin ban paaya
 MGR is ntr's own place but Jayalalithaa's position is bigger than hers in many ways
 jayalalita yahaan bhi uttar bharat ke siyaasi mahanayakon kii tarah uttar ke filmi mahanayakon ko maat de detii hai
 The big stars of Mumbai came into politics from films but could never achieve the status of more than playing Hazari and Salaam

 She fought with opponents, being a woman, fought with shameless allegations, even fought opponents
 34 saal tak 235 vidhansabhaon vaali tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main paanch baar chunaav jeetna aasaan nahin rahaa hoga
 In 2014, when the North Indian media was announcing the all-india Modi wave, Jaya was in awe of 39 mps from Tamil Nadu, a state bordering the Arabian Sea
 39 main 37 siton par ediemke jeet hasil karti he
 We can understand the difficulties of Apollo Hospital
 jayalalita kii sthiti karaab he
 AKMO uses machines only when the situation is extremely critical
 duaen apane charam par hai
 Doctors are taking all kinds of caution
 ilaaj ko lekar bhi or jayalalita ko lekar kis tarah se samvaad kiya jaae, soochna kisi ho ise lekar bhi jujh rahe honge
 Talked to a London doctor
 dilli se doctor ravaanaa hue hai
 We can understand how difficult it is for everyone at this time
 jazbaaton ke bavandar ke saamne khadey hokar medical duty puraa karnaa, use us rup main rakh dena, apni simaaon ke saath unke saamne apradhi kii tarah baahar aane kaa dar kitna bhayaavah hoga
 Imagine what would be going on with the doctors deposited around Jayalalithaa
 unase aaj bhagwaan hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he magar unhen yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki doctor bhagwaan nahin he
 He just cures, someone else saves
 ham khabaranvison ke liye bhi chunauti he ki sahi khabar kya ho
 When are you thodi ruk kar khabar di jaae yaa pehle dene kii hode main ham un lakhon logon ke jazbaaton ko kured den jo pehle se hi baichaiyn hai
 Are not in their control hona to yahi chahie ki khabar pesh karne or use sunne ke bich bhaawanaaon kii koi seemaa na ho magar kai baar aapako khyaal karnaa padataa he
 How would the audience of Ratlam, Sikar, Jalaun, Banaras, Bhagalpur, Rewari, Chamba, Kullu feel the pessary sadness in the districts of Tamil Nadu today
 unka ankar to kabhi jayalalita se mila tak nahin he
 Never even touched Tamil politics
 paidaa hoti hai karnataka main lekin tamilnadu aakar kah detii hai ki main kannadiga nahin tamil hum
 The Ammu name of childhood changes to Amma
 vakil, doctor bananaa chaahati hai, maa filmon main le jaati hai
 Movies become invincible in politics
 jayalalita
 Do not always view politics with dry criticisms and slogans
 jayalalita ke liye yah lagaav harvard se dilli aakar raajnneetik dalon ke mukhyalayon ke peeche ke hisse main bane kamaron main twitor sambhaal rahe manageron kii dein nahin he
 The tweeter handle of his party was made only in February 2014
 39 main se 37 siten jiti
 You will see the analysis of all the newspapers coming out of Delhi at that time, two lines about Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik will not be found properly
 naveen patnayak ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 21 main se 20 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments ab ek sawaal uthta he ki jayalalita or naveen patnayak se apane garh main rashtriya dalon kaa vacharsv to tod diya lekin ve dilli ko pashchim or uttar bharat ke raajnneetik dabadabe se kyon nahin mukt kar sake
 Why could not all the talented leaders of South claim their claim among North India
 1984 main jayalalita rajyasabha kii sadsy banakar dilli to ain thim
 Why did Jayalalitha not choose any Mayawati like Kanshi Ram
 kya unhone ediemke kii niyati ko uske sahare chhodana thik samajha
 Even MGR did not hand over the legacy to any Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita kii raajnneetik kamyaabi or mukhyamantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ko kaise yaad kiya jaae
 How should the people of North India know how this politician from Tamil Nadu changed the state after coming to power and made his position in the political party
 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main jayalalita ke saath marpet hoti he
 She comes out wearing a torn sari and declares that she will return to the House only after becoming the Chief Minister
 paanch baar mukhyamantri banati hai
 In 1991, Jayalalithaa joins Congress to win 225 out of 234 seats
 thik chaar saal baad 2 june 1995 ko uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke guest house main mayawati ke saath marpet kii ghatana hoti he
 UP made Mayawati chief minister four times
 hamalaa mamata banerjee par bhi hota he
 Bengal ceded power to Mamata for the second time
 uttar bharat ke log bhakt ke bare main jaanate hai
 Devotee is that element of the politics of North India whose name is devotee but the rites are not of devotee
 uski bhashaa gaaliyon kii he
 Blind support
 maarane peetane kii he
 Is foolish
 bhakt hona siyasat main netaa kaa bahubali bananaa ho gaya he
 But how to understand this devotion of leaders in South India
 kya tasveeron main dikh rahe rote bilakhte log sirf samarthak kahe ja sakate hai
 Who are the people behind the pro
 kya ham jaan sakenge
 Jayalalithaa made her a Kora devotee with the help of social media or changed her life and she became devoted to Jaya
 ham apollo aspataal kii mushkilon ko samaj sakate hai
 Jayalalithaa's condition is bad
 ekmo mashiinon kaa istamaal tabhi karte hai jab sthiti behad najuk hoti he
 Prayers are at their peak
 doctor har tarah kii satarkta barat rahe hai
 Regarding treatment and how to communicate with Jayalalithaa, how should the information be battling
 landan ke doctor se baat kii gai he
 The doctors have left Delhi
 ham samaj sakate hai ki is vakt sabake liye kitna mushkil he
 How frightening it would be to stand in front of a whirlwind of emotions and complete medical duty, keeping it in that form, fearing to come out like a criminal in front of them with their limitations
 aap kalpana kiijie jayalalita ke aas paas jamaa doctoron par kya guzar rahi hogi
 He is expected to be God today but he is taught that doctor is not God
 wo to bas ilaaj karata he, bachaata koi or he
 We also have a challenge for newsmen as to what is the right news
 kab ho
 In the race to give the news a little pause, or in the race to give first, let us crush the feelings of millions of people who are already restless
 apane kaabo main nahin hai
 It should be that there is no limit to the emotions between presenting the news and listening to it, but sometimes you have to take care
 ratlam, sikar, jalon, banaras, bhagalpur, rewadi, chamba, kullu ke darshak aaj tamilnadu ke zilon main pasri udaasi ko kaise mahasoos karenge
 His anchor has never even met Jayalalithaa
 tamil raajnneeti ko kabhi chhukar dekha bhi nahin
 Born in Karnataka, but Tamil Nadu comes and says that i am not Tamil, not Kannadiga
 bachapan kaa ammu naam ammaa main badal jaataa he
 Lawyer wants to become a doctor, mother takes him to films
 filmon se raajnneeti main ajey ban jaati hai
 Jayalalithaa
 raajnneeti ko hameshaa sukhi aalochanaon or naaron se mat dekhiye
 For Jayalalithaa, this attachment is not the result of managers handling the tweeters in the rooms in the back of the headquarters of political parties coming from Delhi to Delhi
 unki party kaa twitor handle to farvari 2014 main hi bana
 Won 37 seats out of 39
 aap us vakt ke dilli se nikalne vaale tamaam akhabaaron kaa vishleshan dekhiyegaa, jayalalita or naveen patnayak ke bare main do line bhi thik se nahin milegi
 Naveen Patnaik won 20 out of 21 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tippaniyan Now a question arises that Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik broke the clout of national parties in their stronghold, but why they could not liberate Delhi from the political dominance of West and North India
 dakshin ke tamaam pratibhashali netaa apni daavedaari uttar bharat ke bich kyon nahin kar sake
 Jayalalithaa came to Delhi in 1984 as a member of Rajya Sabha
 jayalalita ne kanshiram kii tarah kisi mayawati kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya
 Did they think it was right to abandon the aiadmk's destiny? mjiaar bhi to kisi jayalalita ko viraasat saunp kar nahin gaye the
 How to remember Jayalalithaa's political success and her tenure as Chief Minister
 uttar bharat ke log kaise jaane ki tamilnadu kii is rajaneta ne satta main aakar rajya ko kaise badla or raajnneetik dal main apni haisiyat kaise banaai
 Jayalalithaa is assaulted in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989

 Becomes Chief Minister five times
 1991 main jayalalita congress se milakar 234 main se 225 siten jeet jaati hai
 Exactly four years later, on June 2, 1995, an incident of assault with Mayawati takes place in a guest house in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 upi ne mayawati ko chaar baar mukhyamantri banaaya
 The attack also takes place on Mamta Banerjee

 All-rounder Hardik Pandya, who emerged as the new star of Indian cricket in the recent past, has brought some memories about his debut
 hardik ne bataaya ki jab apane debyue hi match main australia ke khilaaf vah dabaav mahasoos kar rahe the, tab mahendra singh dhoni ne aakar unhen kuch samajhaayaa tha jiske baad vah shant hue or apane andar badlaav laa paae
 Let me tell you that Pandya gave 21 runs in the very first over of his international career, and there was also a warning of ICC Code of Conduct with Chris Lynn for bad man
 pandya ne us baat ko yaad karte hue kaha ki vah ek bure sapane kii tarah tha, apane pehle hi over main 21 ran dene ke baad main puri tarah se dabaav mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 i was feeling absolutely blanched, not understanding anything
 lekin tabhi maahi bhai mere paas aae or unhone kaha, ''ek or over daalega''
 Your 1
 1 over ke baad hi maine 28 ran de die the, lekin baad ke overs main sirf 7-8 ran hi die
 Even after that Mahi Bhai did not say anything to me
 hardik bole ki dhoni ne bas kaha ki mujhe pataa tha ki pehle over ke baad tu acchhee bowling karegaa
 Let's do this @ hardikpandya7👻👻 Today 5 pm @ bwchampspic

 He was also most shocked by the death of the father
 bhopal singh kii maut ke kuch saal baad hi achaanak ek haadase main lalit kii awaz bhi chali gai
 Lalit was completely shattered by the death of his father and the loss of voice
 kaaphi ilaaj ke baad bhi uski awaz nahin lauti
 According to close family members, Lalit started rescuing the housemates during the time that he saw his father Bhopal Singh
 wo unase baat bhi karte hai

 Which was already very religious
 vakt gujarata gaya or lalit ko ab aae din uske pita dikhaai dene lage
 The limit was reached when he started listening and obeying his orders

 All the orders were written in the register, according to the register received from the house, one day Lalit's father ordered him to meet the family
 'aakhri samay par jhatka lagegaa, aasmaan hilegaa, dharti hilegi
 But don't you worry, make the chanting fast, i will save you

 It is written in this register quoting father Bhopal Singh, 'I will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, if i cannot come then i will come later
 ' register main likhi har baat lalit ne likhi thi
 The story did not end here
 lalit pita se milane ke baad ab isi register main bhagwaan se milane kii bhi baat karne laga
 Which was written in such a way that his father Bhopal Singh is not writing this fine
 register main aage likhaa tha, 'tumhen pataa he ki bhagwaan kabhi bhi hamaare ghar main aa sakate hai isliye puri taiyaari rakho
 'nobody came to save the police, it was the fine who was not only writing the father's orders in the register
 balki use hoobahoo puraa bhi kar rahaa tha
 But the voice that promised Lalit to save everyone
 usne bachaaya hi nahin
 Actually there was no such voice
 ye to bas lalit kaa vaham tha
 Which was heard due to an illness

 On the 79th day of 'bigg Boss' house starts with Manu, Manveer and Mona talking, the three are talking about Nitibha that she is following Bani's footsteps and she feels that she can move alone 
 vahiin duusari taraf rohan bani se kahata he ki lopa baaten samajhati nahin hai, vah nahin chaahate ki tivi par lopa galat dikhe
 Rohan said that even after his apology, Lopa's behavior is the same
 baad main 'big bos' gharavaalon ko mauka dete hai sho kii prise mani badhaakar 50 lakh karne kaa
 Nitibha and Swami Om introduce the goods train for the immunity of two weeks
 iske liye 'big bos' rohan or monalisa ko kanfeshan room main bulaate hai or unase gharavaalon kii keemat tay karne ke liye kehete hai
 Rohan and Mona charge Lopa the highest and Swami Om the lowest
 malgadee task ke liye ghar ke garden aria ko railway patari kaa rup diya gaya tha, jahaan train kaa ek ingine or uske peeche ek jelnuma bogi rakhi gai thi
 Mona and Rohan were made jailers while the rest of the members of the house were taken as prisoners and were seated in that jailed bogie
 khel ki niyamon ke anusaar har syran par rohan or mona ko jail main band ek kaidi ko reeha kar 'big bos' ko saunpna tha
 The price of the released prisoner will be added to the show's prize money
 is task main ek twist yah tha ki jo kaidi khud ko reeha kar bogi se nikalegaa vah ghar kii captaini kaa daavedaar ban jayega lekin uski keemat prise mani main nahin judegi
 Rohan and Mona had to rotate the engine-mounted liver continuously
 tippaniyan Shortly after the task started, Bani walked out, stating that she wanted to do the task of captivity, although Lopamudra, Nitibha and Manveer did not support her decision
 bani ke baahar nikalne ke kuch der baad hi swami om ghar main waapas aae, kal ke episod main dikhaaya gaya tha ki bahari duniya main bani paristhitiyon kii vajah se unhen ghar se baahar janaa pad rahaa he
 As soon as he came, he started his strange acts
 jaise hi swami om ko pataa chalaa ki bogi se nikalne par vah captaini ke daavedaar ban jaaenge, vah baahar nikalne kii koshish karne lage
 manu-manveer explained to him that he could come out only after the siren sounded, then he stopped for a while
 iske baad jaise hi syran baja vah baahar nikal gaye
 Later 'bigg Boss' warned him that if he does not go back to jail, he will not get the captaincy claim
 iske baad vah jail main waapas gaye
 Rohan and Mona first release Lopamudra from jail
 iske kuch der baad swami om jail se baahar nikal gaye
 After this, 'bigg Boss' stopped the task for the night
 jail se jaldi nikalne ke bani ke faisle par sabhi unke khilaaf najar aae
 Late in the night, Manu and Nitibha started talking about Manveer's captaincy and friendship
 manu ne kaha ki manavir hameshaa swami om kaa saath dete hai or ghar ke captain kii tarah bartaav nahin karte
 He also tells Nitibha that he always supported Manveer but he does not do so
 task ke bare main baat karte hue manu ne kaha ki dost hone ke naate manavir ko unase yaa nitibha se kahana chahie tha ki tum log jaao captain bano main yahaan baithta hum
 But he did not say so
 vahiin der raat lopamudra rohan se kahati hai ki bani kaa rohan se dosti badhanaa unki stritegi kaa hissaa he or rohan ko unase sanbhalkar rahanaa chahie
 On this, Rohan said that there is nothing like this, Bani's best friend has gone away from home and they will have to talk to someone or other to get help
 vah isliye unase baat karti hai
 Later, 'bigg Boss' gives the family a chance to increase the prize money of the show to 50 lakhs
 nitibha or swami om do-do hafton kii immunityiske liye vah malgadee task introdeus karte hai
 For this, 'bigg Boss' calls Rohan and Monalisa in the confession room and asks them to fix the price of the family
 rohan or mona lopa kii keemat sabase adhik or swami om kii keemat sabase kam lagaate hai
 For the goods train task, the garden area of the house was given the shape of a railway track, where an engine of the train and a jailed bogie were placed behind it
 mona or rohan ko jailer banaaya gaya jabaki ghar ke baaki sadasyon ko kaidi banaakar us jelnuma bogi main baithaaya gaya tha
 As per the rules of the game, Rohan and Mona were to release a prison inmate on each siren and hand it to the 'big Boss'
 reeha hone vaale kaidi kii keemat sho ke prise mani main judati jaaegi
 a twist in this task was that the prisoner who released himself from the bogey would become a contender for the captaincy of the house but his price would not be included in the prize money
 rohan or mona ko ingine main lage liver ko lagaataar ghumana tha
 The comments task shuru hone ke kuch der baad hi bani yah kahati hui baahar nikal gayi ki vah captency kaa task karnaa chaahati hai, haalanki lopamudra, nitibha or manavir ne unke is faisle kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Shortly after Bani's exit, Swami Om returned to the house, yesterday's episode showed that he was forced to move out of the house due to circumstances created in the outside world
 aate hi unhone apni vicitra harakatein shuru kar deen
 As soon as Swami Om came to know that he would become the captaincy contender on leaving the bogey, he started trying to get out
 manu-manavir ne unhen samajhaayaa ki syran bajane ke baad hi vah baahar nikal sakate hai tab vah thodi der ke liye ruke
 After this, he exited as soon as the siren rang
 baad main 'big bos' ne unhen chetavanee di ki vah jail main waapas nahin jaaenge to unhen captaini kii daavedaari nahin milegi
 He then went back to jail
 rohan or mona ne sabase pehle lopamudra ko jail se reeha kiya
 Shortly thereafter, Swami Om got out of jail
 iske baad 'big bos' ne raat bhar ke liye task roak diya
 All of them appeared against Bani's decision to leave early
 der raat manu or nitibha manavir kii captaini or dosti par baat karne lage
 Manu said that Manveer always supports Swami Om and does not behave like the captain of the house
 vah nitibha se yah bhi kehete hai ki unhone hameshaa manavir ko saport kiya lekin vah aisa nahin karte
 Talking about the task, Manu said that as a friend Manveer should have told him or Nitibha that you guys go become captain, i sit here
 lekin unhone aisa nahin kaha
 At the same time, Lopamudra tells Rohan that Bani's friendship with Rohan is part of his strategy and Rohan should take care of him
 is par rohan ne kaha ki aisa kuch nahin he, bani kaa sabase acha dost ghar se chalaa gaya he or unhen cervive karne ke liye kisi na kisi se to baat kerani padegi
 She therefore talks to him
 task shuru hone ke kuch der baad hi bani yah kahati hui baahar nikal gayi ki vah captency kaa task karnaa chaahati hai, haalanki lopamudra, nitibha or manavir ne unke is faisle kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Shortly after Bani's exit, Swami Om returned to the house, yesterday's episode showed that he was forced to move out of the house due to circumstances created in the outside world

 At the same time, Lopamudra tells Rohan that Bani's friendship with Rohan is part of his strategy and Rohan should take care of him
 is par rohan ne kaha ki aisa kuch nahin he, bani kaa sabase acha dost ghar se chalaa gaya he or unhen cervive karne ke liye kisi na kisi se to baat kerani padegi
 She therefore talks to him
 vahiin der raat lopamudra rohan se kahati hai ki bani kaa rohan se dosti badhanaa unki stritegi kaa hissaa he or rohan ko unase sanbhalkar rahanaa chahie
 On this, Rohan said that there is nothing like this, Bani's best friend has gone away from home and they will have to talk to someone or other to get help

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni party ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko bijepi or aresas se seekhney kii naseehat di he
 This statement of Rahul Gandhi came out during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Sunday
 is bich rahul gandhi ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye ranneeti banane par bhi jor diya
 He said that all the opposition parties will together defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, but in the meantime, the Congress President in his speech, talking about the functioning of the BJP and the RSS, also gave the leaders of the party the advice to learn from them
 dilachasp baat yah he ki CWC kii baithak main die gaye rahul ke kareeb 17 minute ke bhaashan ko party kii taraf se utyub par aplod kiya gaya, lekin kuch minuton main hi hataa liya gaya
 Since then, questions are arising as to why the party removed Rahul's speech from youtube? After all, what did Rahul Gandhi say in his speech, which had to be removed from youtube? However, let us tell you what Rahul said about BJP-RSS at CWC meeting? Learn hard from BJP and RSS: According to Rahul Gandhi Sutras, Rahul told over 200 party leaders who came to CWC meeting that we are on tough front Are shy of working rahul ne adivasee samudaay kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki dashak bhar pehle tak yah samudaay congress kaa voter tha, lekin bijepi or aresas ke log adivaasiyon ke bich gaye, unke saath kaam kiya, unhen samajhaayaa or aaj wo bijepi ko vot dete hai
 In fact, through this example, Rahul's aim was to highlight the hard work done by the BJP and RSS and tell the Congress leaders not to hesitate to work hard in the same way
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar congress ke log mahaj adivaasiyon ke bich chale bhar jaaen, to dubaara se ye samudaay congress kii taraf laut saktaa he
 If a BJP government is formed, it gives incentives to its workers
 Another party source said that in the concluding speech, Rahul Gandhi also raised the issue of neglect of workers in Congress
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kii jab sarkaar banati he, to wo apane kaaryakartaaon ko 'incentive' detii he, jabaki congress kaaryakarta kii apni sarkaar main koi puch nahin hoti
 So wherever he (rahul Gandhi) goes, Congress workers complain about his neglect
 CWC kii baithak main yah doosraa bindu tha, jab rahul ne bijepi or sangh kaa udhaaharan dekar congress netaaon ko naseehat di
 BJP wants to be taken in history and Congress in future: Rahul Gandhi in Congress Working Committee meeting said that Rahul Gandhi helps rss-linked organizations like Saraswati Shishu Mandir etc
 when the BJP government is formed

 koi bhi vyakti ghanti bajaakar raja se nyaay paane ke liye prarthana kar saktaa tha
 Can any poor or deprived person come here today with their grievance? "he said," This question is the most important, because in the Preamble of the Constitution, we all accepted the responsibility of providing justice for all

 However, both France and India have denied this report

 France, while clarifying on Saturday, said that there was a global agreement between the tax department and the Reliance subsidiary there, and no political intervention has been done in this

 Will the country's highways become smart before the smart city? The jamming of toll points through only one device will stop
 desh ke tamaam haive par ab smart technology se las upkaran lagenge
 The government has made up its mind to prepare DPR for projects through satellite to make highway more secure
 isse na keval deepiar jaldi banegaa balki zyada haive kaa nirmaan dizin ke str par bhi durghatnaon ke nazariye se bhi surakshit hoga

 There will be a keen eye on the driver and the transport
 a small device will not only make transportation easier, but it will also keep a close watch on the driver and the vehicle
 yani gaadi main sirf ek chip feet karne ke saath hi chaalak or parivahan donon kaabo main rahenge
 With this device equipped with GPS system, the workload of more than 2
5 lakh motor traffic police personnel and officers across the country can be reduced
 niyam todane par vasulegaa jurmaanavisheshgyon ke mutabik ye upkaran lagane ke baad insurance, pradooshan certificate jaise kagajaat chack karne kii jarurat nahin rah jaaegi

 Traffic policemen will reduce burden Vineet Goenka, member of the IT task force of the ministry, said that through this, traffic can be controlled in many ways
 saath hi lakhon police karmiyon ko is kaam se fursat mil sakati he or unka istemaal lau and order main ho saktaa he

 The team of experts will create such an effect by the chemical reaction in the soil around the highway that the soil there will be harder than the stone and suitable for the highway
 jisase sadak dhansane jaise haadase nahin honge saath hi haive kii umr bhi badhegi

 Explain that former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi on Friday claimed that election strategist Prashant Kishore had met her husband Lalu Prasad and proposed that the JD (U) of RJD and Nitish Kumar be merged and thus become The new party should declare their 'prime ministerial candidate' before the elections
 unhone kaha ki agar prashanth kishor purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad se is prastaav ko lekar mulaakaat karne se inkaar karte hai to vah ‘safed jhooth' bol rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore tweeted on Saturday and wrote- 'those found guilty on charges of misuse of post and misuse of money are claiming to be the guardians of truth
 lalu prasad yadav ji jab chahen, mere saath media ke saamne baith jaaen, sabko pataa chal jayega ki mere or unke bich kya baat hui or kisne kisko kya ofer diya
 "RJD national vice president Rabri Devi said," i got very angry and asked him to leave because i could not trust him after Nitish cheated
 ' rabari devi bihar vidhaan parishad main netaa pratipaksh ke pad par bhi hai
 In the year 2017, Nitish Kumar left the RJD and the Congress and joined the bjp-led NDA
 rabari devi ne kaha, ‘hamaare sabhi karmchaaree or surakshakarmi is baat ke gavaah hai ki unhone hamase kam se kam paanch baar mulaakaat kii

 The Modi government has removed the provisions of Article 370 granting privileges to Jammu and Kashmir
 vahiin sarkaar ne rajyasabha main rajya punargathan kaa bhi sankalp pesh kiya
 Due to which Jammu and Kashmir has now become a union territory
 vahiin isse ladakh ko alag karte hue alag rajya banane kii baat kahi gai he
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister who was subjected to criticisms about his policies on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, also knew that Article 370 has to be removed one day
 unki is bhavishyavaanee kii jhalak jammu-kashmir ke tatkaaleen netaa pan
 Premnath appears in a letter to Bajaj
 kya kaha tha pan
 Nehru on August 21, 1962, regarding Article 370 Pt
 premnath bajaj ke patr kaa uttar dete hue jawahar laal nehru ne likhaa tha,"vaastaviktaa yah he ki samvidhan main is dhara ke rahete hue bhi, jo ki jammu-kashmir ko ek vishesh darja detii he, bahut kuch kiya ja chukaa he or jo kuch thodi bahut baadha he, vah bhi dhire-dhire samaapt ho jaaegi
 The question is more about sentimentality, rather than something else
 kabhi-kabhi bhaavana mahatvapurn hoti he lekin hamen donon pakshon ko taulnaa chahie or main sochataa hum ki vartmaan main hamen is sambandh main or koi parivartan nahin karnaa chahie
 "jawaharlal Nehru and Pt
 premnath bajaj ke bich hue is patr vyavhaar kaa zikr jammu-kashmir ke purv rajyapal jagmohan ne apni kitaab- dahakate angaare main kiya he
 Jagmohan writes in his book that this letter shows that Nehru himself did not deny future changes to Article 370
 'bahut kuch kiya ja chukaa he'- mana ja rahaa he ki is kathan ke peeche nehru kaa aashay tha ki dhara 370 main jarurat padane par sarkaar sanshodhan karti rahi he
 In such a time, other provisions will also be eradicated gradually through amendments
 sattadhari kulinon kii jeben bharta he anuchhed 370- jagmohanjagmohan do baar jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal rahe
 He was the first governor from April 1984 to June 1989 and the second time between January 1990 to May 1990
 is dauraan vah jammu-kashmir main hui kai nirnaayak ghatnaon ke gavaah bhi rahe
 In the eyes of Jagmohan, the strongest roots of separatism and schism in Jammu and Kashmir remained in Article 370 of the Indian Constitution
 unhone kitaab main likhaa he- kashmir samasya kaa vaastavik hal kamajoriyon or nakaaratmak kaarnon ko dur karke hi sambhav he
 a new India is needed for a new vision and a new India
 kashmir main paakhandee niti apni simaaen tod chuki hai
 Today the leaders of India have adopted a tendency to remain in the shadow of illusions rather than face the smoldering truths
 jagmohan ne apni kitaab dahakate angaare main likhaa he ki kashmiri algaavvaad or foot kii sabase majboot jaden bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 main hai
 Which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 nihit swaarthon dwaara is dhara kaa durupyog hota he
 Jagmohan wrote in his diary on 15 August 1986 - Article 370 is the only means to enrich the exploiters in this heavenly state
 yah garibon ko luutata he
 This confuses them like mirage
 yah sattadhari kulinon kii jeben bharta he
 Increases the importance of new sultans
 kaise lagu hua tha anuchhed 370desh ko aazaadee milane ke baad riyasaton ke ekikaran kii prakriya shuru hui
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's letter to the Chief Ministers of 25 July 1952 gives information about the implementation of Article 370
 is patr main nehru ne likhaa he- jab november 1949 main ham bharat ke samvidhan ko antim rup de rahe the
 Sardar Patel then looked into the matter
 tab unhone jammu or kashmir ko hamaare samvidhan main ek vishesh kintu sankramanakalin darja diya
 This status was recorded in the Constitution as Article 370
 iske alaava 26 janvari 1950 ko raashtrapati ke aadesh ke madhyam se bhi ise darj kiya gaya
 Only a few parts of our Constitution apply to Kashmir through this Article and through this Order

 The dates of Himachal Pradesh assembly elections can be announced today
 congress jahaan apni satta ko bachaane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi he, to duusari ore bijepi modi ke sahare satta main vaapasi kii aas lagaae he
 If we look at the results of the last few assembly elections, it is clear that once the Congress and once the BJP have been occupying the throne of state power
 himachal pradesh main kul 68 vidhansabha site hai
 In the last assembly election, out of 68 seats in the state, Congress got 36, BJP 26 and others got 6 seats
 congress ko 2007 kii tulana main 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 13 siton kaa phayda hua tha, vahiin bijepi ko 2007 kii tulana main 2012 main 16 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Congress votes increased, the BJP got 43 per cent votes and BJP 39 per cent votes in the 2012 assembly elections
 2007 kii tulana main congress kaa vot 5 fisadi badha jabaki bijepi ko 5 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 The BJP lagged behind the Congress by just 4 per cent votes but got 10 seats less than the Congress
 himachal vidhansabha chunaav 2012ke nateezon se saaf he ki har baar kii tarah rajya kii janata ne satta parivartan karke congress ke haathon main bagdor saunpi
 In 2012, Virbhadra Singh of Congress was crowned on the throne of Himachal power, but in five years he has faced many difficulties
 virbhadra singh or himachal pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh sukhwinder singh sukkhu ke bich kalah khulkar saamne aa gai
 21 Himachal mlas have refused to contest elections under the leadership of Virbhadra Singh
 modi ke naam par hi vot maangegi bijepiudhar bijepi satta main vaapasi ke liye modi ke sahare he
 Presently, the BJP is not pursuing any face in Himachal
 upi, uttarakhand, haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand ke nakshe kadam par bijepi chal rahi he
 That is, after winning the election here, she can present the face of the Chief Minister
 bataa den ki himachal main 1985 se lekar abhi tak jitne vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 In these, once the Congress and once the BJP has occupied the throne of power
 himachal vidhansabha kaa gathan 1962 main hua
 Earlier Himachal used to be a part of Punjab
 himachal main 12 baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav hua he
 Out of these, 8 times Congress, 3 times BJP and 1 time Janata Party have occupied the throne of power
 himachal main congress ko pehla jhatka 1977 main laga, jab janata party se use buree tarah maat khaani padi
 When the Janata Party government was formed in 1977, Shanta Kumar became the Chief Minister of Himachal
 iske baad 1982 main vidhansabha chunaav main janata party ko congress se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Congress again came to power in the 1985 assembly elections
 lekin iske baad 1990 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi prachand bahumat ke saath satta main waapas ai or shanta kumaar mukhyamantri bane
 But three years later, when the Assembly elections were held in 1993, the BJP faced defeat and the Congress returned to power
 doharaaya jayega itihaas yaa hoga chamatkaarapanch saal baad 1998 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or bijepi kii satta main vaapasi hui or prem kumaar dhumal mukhyamantri bane
 After this, when the Assembly elections were held in 2003, the Congress defeated the BJP and returned to power
 isi tarah 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko satta se bedakhal hona padaa or bijepi kii vaapasi hui
 Himachal again repeated its history in 2012 and Congress returned and BJP was out of power
 is raajnneetik parampara ko dekha jaae to bijepi is baar apni jeet aashwast maanakar chal rahi he
 On the other hand, given the discord the Congress is facing and the kind of allegations Virbhadra Singh is stuck in, the party will have to expect a miracle to save its power

 With these words strutting and waving fists in the air, Donald John Trump hardly took him seriously when he began his election campaign in June 2015 to gain the world's most powerful chair
 us samay ve sirf trump orgenigeshan ke adhyaksh the, ek property kuber, jisane madhyavargeey makaan, bade-bade resort or golf course banaae the
 And he got his surname written in big and golden letters on what he built
 trump ko ek budhata reality tivi star samajhakar khaarij kar diya gaya tha, jo beongepan se dhankuber kii apni haisiyat par khulkar ithlaata rahata tha (''main vaaki, vaaki amir hum''), or kaarobaar main apni uplabdhiyon ke bade-bade daawey karata rahata tha
 But when he was asked about his tax return, he used to look right and left
 trump jis tarah mahilaon ke bare main bolte the or america raashtrapati baraak obama samet apane sabhi virodhiyon par apmanjanak aarope lagaate the, usase yahi lagata he ki unka apni jabaan par koi niyantran nahin he
 He went on to say about Obama that he was not born in the United States and is a stealthy Muslim
 yahaan tak ki trump ne jab republican party kii ore se ummidavaari jiti to sabhi log chakit rah gaye the
 His own party did not expect that he would win the presidential election
 udhar, unki democratic virdohi hillari clinton shandaar shakhsiyat kii misaal hai
 Her achievements were seen, she was the first woman to hold a post-graduate degree in her country, the first woman to hold an elected position and to serve as a foreign minister and a large political party
 She was the first woman candidate for the presidency
 agar ve raashtrapati pad kaa chunaav jeet jaatin to ve america kii pehali mahila raashtrapati banatin or is tarah america ke pehle ashwet raashtrapati obama kii sahi uttaradhikari hotin
 Till the polls, most of the election pundits predicted Trump's defeat
 isse pehle america ke 150 se bhi zyada pramukh akhabaaron ne hillari clinton kii hi jeet kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 Still Trump kept on saying, "I will prove everyone wrong, everyone
" '' apni chunavi reliyon main unhone logon se kaha, ''america ko ab shsirf laffaaji or kaam kuch nahin'' karne vaale netaaon kii jarurat nahin he
 He needs people working efficiently who understand how work is done
 hamen rajnatik jumalon kii jarurat nahin he—hamen saamaanya samajhadaari kii jarurat he
 America has sunk
 hamen is bare main baat band kar deni chahie or is samasya ko dur karnaa chahie
 i know how this can happen
 ''jab 9 november kii subah america chunaavon ke nattejey ghoshit hue to trump ne na sirf hillari clinton ko haraa diya, balki bahumat se haraakar apane aalochakon kaa bhi munh band kar diya
 He is now going to be sworn in as the 45th President of the US on January 20, 2017
 donald trump kaam karne vaale niraash madhyavargeey americiyon—mukhya rup se gore or isai—kaa dil jeetne main kaamyaab rahe or unka samarthan paakar yahaan tak ja pahunche
 Middle-class Americans who supported him believed that they had become financially weak year after year and that the power system — Washington DC, an elite group of politicians, including Hillary Clinton — was responsible for this condition
 purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar or is samay america think tanks brookings institution main pratishthit phelo shivashankar menon trump kii jeet ko duniya bhar main abhijatya varg kii pakad dhili hote jane or duniya ke puraane pratishthanon va unki vichaardhaaraon ke patan ke hisse ke rup main dekhte hai
 These include the fall of liberalism
 unka maananaa he ki dinodin adhiktar desh ''nirankushtawad, roodhiwaad, kumparasti or ek majboot netritv'' kii taraf mud rahe hai
 He is of the opinion that in many countries, including Britain, resentment against immigrants has increased in the community
 yahi vajah he ki britain ke logon ne is saal europe se alag hone ke liye brexit kaa samarthan kiya
 When Trump sits in the Oval Office in January, he will face a severely divided US — for which he is himself responsible
 ling, nasl, dharm or varg ke aadhaar par is vibhaajan ko unhone apane jahrile or belgaum chunavi prachaar se or gaharaa kar diya he
 With Hillary Clinton winning the overall popular vote in this election, it is clear that America is now divided into two parts
 trump kaa america prachand rashtrawaad se bharaa hua he, vah vaishviktawaad kaa virdohi he or uske man main videshiyon ke prati ashanka kaa bhav he
 He believes that America should be wealthier and more American
 duusari taraf hillari kaa america zyada samaveshi or bahu-saanskrithik he, kyonki unka maananaa he ki america kii bhalmansahat ne hi use mahaan banaaya he
 Then, what will Trump's job as president and his working style be? Trump is the first US president in recent history to hold any government position before
 na hi ve aise vyakti ke rup main jane jate hai, jisaki bade muddon par apni koi gahari raay ho
 Michael Crepan, the founding president of the Stimson Center, a Washington-based thinktank, does not hide his apprehension about President Trump's prospects
 ve kehete hai, ''unke bare main ham jo pehali cheez jaanate hai vah yah he ki ve khud ko pyaar karte hai
 The other thing is that they do not know at all how the world works and there are people around them who also have limited information about it
 ''trump ke simit shabdkosh main raashtra yaa log yaa to achche or sundar hote hai yaa bure or dusht hote hai (unhone hillari ke liye kaha tha, ''kitni badmijaaj aurat he
 '') And events and situations are 'great' or 'badhala'
 apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan trump lagaataar apni raay badalte rahe or pramukh muddon par donon taraf khadey hote dikhaai die (vaise hillari ne bhi aisa hi kiya)
 Trump was initially in favor of abortion and later became 'for life'
 unhone pehle apravasiyon par roak lagane kii baat kii or baad main apana rukh naram kar liya
 In the same way, he remained stuck between being in favor and opposing business
 apni pustak kripold america main rajkaaj ke bare main apni raay kaa izhaar karte hue trump likhte hai, ''hamen ek aise netaa kii jarurat he jo hamaari pareshaaniyon ko dur kar sake or samasyaon kaa vyaavhaarik samaadhaan nikaalnaa shuru kare
 "he further writes:" My goal is not to produce thousands of pages of government legislation like the others
 hamen vyaavhaarik buddhi vaali nitiyon kii jarurat he or jarurat pade to sakhti se unhen lagu karnaa chahie
 His election speeches make it clear that the main principles of his rule will be based on nationalism, protectionism and separatism
 carnegi andoument for international pis ke senior associat eshle je
 Tallis, who has worked in both Republican and Democratic governments, believes Trump from the very first day will begin to see the interest of "native Americans," as the people who voted him believe in the last two decades They are hurt due to globalization of the economy
 isliye trump jin muddon par sabase pehle dhyaan denge, ve hai gharelu aarthik or saamaajik praathamiktaayen, jaise naukariyon ke zyada avasar taiyaar karnaa, aay badhanaa, behatar swasthya suvidha muhaiyaa karana, buniyadi suvidhaayen behatar karnaa or shaharon main aparaadh ko kam karnaa
 In his quest to achieve his goal, Trump alone wants to act like a squad that fixes everything
 pad par baithne ke pehle din hi unki yojana 'effordable care act' ko radd karne kii he
 This law is more known as 'obamacare'
 is kanoon ko maujuuda raashtrapati kii ore se swasthya seva kii gunvattta badhaane or use vahan yogya banane kaa ek pramukh kaam mana jaataa he
 In addition to cutting taxes to add more money to people's pockets, Trump is also promising to reinvigorate America's crumbling infrastructure, including airports and railway stations
 trump ke duusare mudde ye honge ki america main bade satta kendron ko kaise niyantrit kiya jaae, kyonki ve raashtrapati ke adhikaron—jinamein seenet or supreme court bhi shaamil hai—par ankush lagane or unhen santulit karne ke taur par kaam karte hai
 Trump is fortunate to have a Republican majority in the Senate in the current cycle of elections and a majority in the House of Representatives
 isse unhen takaraav kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa, jaisaa ki obama ko apane kaarykaal main congress ke donon sadanon main karnaa padaa tha
 So Trump is stepping into the office with a profitable position
 ve party ke nirdeshon se bhi bandhe nahin hai kyonki unhone aise samay chaunkaane vaali jeet hasil kii he jab yah laga ki republican party banty hui thi or kamjor hoti ja rahi thi
 The only apprehension is that in Trump's own words he is a 'lone soldier'
 isliye navnirvaachit raashtrapati agar apane krantikari agenda ko aage badhanaa chaahate hai to unhen donon dishaao ko jodgaye ke liye pul banane kaa gur siikhnaa hoga
 It has been criticized so far that Trump lacks talented people and most of the advisors on his team lack experience, especially when it comes to governance and foreign policy
 apane aalochakon ko jawaab dete hue trump ne kaha, ''is samay duniya kii haalat ko dekho
 He is in a very poor condition
 isse zyada khatarnaak samay pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 The so-called insiders within Washington's ruling class are the ones who have got us in trouble
 to ham unki taraf kyon dhyaan den
 "the thing that will be closely watched now is who they hold important positions like foreign, defense, treasury, home security and CIA
" chunaavon ke dauraan unke krantikari or kabhi-kabhi bhadakaau bhaashanon ko dekhen to trump kii videsh niti dekhne vaali hogi, jis par har kahin visheshgyon or sarkaron kii baariki se najar hogi
 Some of the hallmarks of his election promises: immigration (build high walls on the southern border of the US and impose heavy penalties on producers from other countries), foreign trade (talk again on NAFTA and raise tariffs for China), WTO (we tighten Negotiation), international alliances (NATO members must pay their dues for security), Russia (putin is a fast man), Iran (soon after becoming president Will cancel the nuclear deal), Climate Change Treaty (global warming is just one bogey) and Islamic terrorism (we will no longer be a threat to anyone, so that will strongly attack the fast ISIS)
 america main purv bhartiya rajdoot mira shankar kahati hai, ''trump duniya ke liye khatra sabit honge yaa nahin, hamen iskaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 But his attitude has caused uncertainty in the whole world
 ''videsh niti ke maamle main 'trump kaa siddhant' unke chunaav prachaar ke shuru main hi badi sooyeeboojh se taiyaar kar liya gaya thah ''ham takat se kaam karenge
 This means that we will have to maintain the strongest army ever in the world
 hamen dikhaanaa hoga ki jo desh hamaare saath milakar kaam karen, unhen apni aarthik takat se puraskrit karnaa hoga or jo log saath na hon, unhen dandit karnaa hoga
 We will have to forge alliances with our partners that benefit each other
 ham puri duniya ke liye pahrue bane rahenge to hamen isaki keemat milani chahie
 "trump's fanatical views on immigration can have an impact on America's neighbors and the crisis-ridden West Asia
" apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan unhone avaidh ghuspaith par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or unke shabd bahut joshilay theah ''hamaare dakshin ke desh apane behtareen logon ko nahin bhej rahe hai
 Not only from Mexico, but also from other countries, bad people are entering our country
 main ek oonchi diwaar banavaayuungaa or mujhase acchhee diwaar or koi nahin bana saktaa he
 And keep my words in mind, Mexico will have to pay for this wall
 '' or syria pararu ''syria ke logon ko hajaaron kii sankhya main sharan dene se nishchit rup se bahut-si samasyaayein khadi hongi
 We do not know how terrible they will be, because we do not have any security nor do we have such qualifications
 ise rokna hoga or jaldi rokna hoga
 "the real concern in foreign policy is Trump's attitude towards global trade, security alliances and economic factionalism
" telis kehete hai ki raashtrapati ke taur par trump ke paas adhikaar hoga ki america ne jin sandhiyon par dastakhat kiye hai, unhen ve radd kar sakate hai
 But they will have to face tough opinions from American business on these questions
 ve sandhiyon ko andhadhundh tareeke se radd karne or suraksha ke liye paison kii khatir nato ke sadasyon ko dhamkaane ko lekar chetavanee dete hai, ''america pashchim uresia main niti ko badalane par apane phaaydon ko ganvaa saktaa he
 The entire European system relies on the promise that us-led alliances will be responsible for external security challenges
 agar aap use khatm kar denge to aap roosiyon or kisi ko bhi yah chhot de denge ki vah europe ko pyaaj kii paraton kii tarah chhilkar rakh de
 This will spoil the entire policy of America which has been in our interest after 65 years of World War
 ''menon kaa anumaan he ki trump shaayad apane purvavarti raashtrapatiyon kii tarah utana zyada dakhal dene vaale raashtrapati nahin honge
 With less interference from the US, the possibility of meddling in international affairs on behalf of medium power countries like Russia, China and India will increase
 agar trump apane vaade ke mutabik vishwa vyavastha ko jhakzor dete hai, to bharat ko chaukas rahanaa hoga
 In his statements about India and Indians, he has been reticent and rude (sometimes laughable)
 aisa unhone chaahe iradatan kiya ho yaa naadaani main, magar apane chunaav abhiyaan kii ek sabha main ve sirf hinduon ke saath hi judate dikhaai die the or unhone kuch khanaapurti karne vaali baaten kahi thim ki kis tarah 'hindu samudaay ne vishwa sajaayta or america samskruti ko shandaar yogadan diya he
 And we hope to celebrate our shared values of independent entrepreneurship, hard work, family values, and a strong American foreign policy
 ''haalanki hindustan ke saath rishte unki praathamiktaaon main upar dikhaai nahin dete
 But in order to provide more jobs for Americans, they had sought to reduce the number of skilled visas given to the skilled and asked the American companies to pay attention to the American workers for the open jobs, it gave the Indian IT companies and expatriates Has put you in worry
 phir bhi kul milakar visheshgyon ko lagata he ki bharat or america ke bich rishte pichley dashak main ek aise mukaam par pahunch gaye hai jahaan sarkaar badalane se unki pakki raftaar par koi asar padane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 "we do not spoil the nights thinking of who will win the elections," says a senior foreign ministry official
 pichley dashak ke dauraan hamane itane saadhan to juta hi liye hai ki jinke dam par ham kisi ke bhi paas pahunch sakate hai
 And our relationship with America is so sure that changing the leadership in any country does not hurt
 ''magar is baat ko lekar jarur chintaaen hai ki ve china ke saath kaise nibatenge
 The Obama administration had pushed for an Asian axis to surround China and India was a major player in the strategic multiplication of the US in the region
 china ko lekar trump kii niti aspasht he, sivaa iske ki kaarobaari rishton ko lekar ve kadai se pesh aa sakate hai
 But given his doubts and objections to US policy of interference, his administration may be less strict about China's aggressive expansionist intentions in the South China Sea
 na hi is baat kii koi sambhaavna he ki parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh main bharat ke daakhile main rukaawat paidaa karne se rokane ke liye ve china par dabaav daalenge
 This is not good news for India
 jahaan tak pakistan kii baat he, is baat kii sambhaavna nahin he ki trump uske prati america niti main koi amulchul badlaav karenge
 Moed Yusuf, associate vice president of the US Institute of Peace's Asia Center and an expert on US relations with Pakistan, believes Trump will continue his broad consensus to rein in Islamabad without breaking ties with it
 ve maanate hai ki america pakistan ko bharat ke saath jodakar nahin dekhne kii saavdhaanee bartegaa or aatank ke mudde se kadai se nipatega
 There is no possibility that Trump will support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans to isolate Pakistan in the international fraternity
 pakistan kaa santulan shaayad hi bigadgaye den
 Yusuf also says that America is more unhappy with Pakistan about its Afghan policy
 trump ne afghanistan ko lekar apane iraadon kaa abhi tak koi khulaasa nahin kiya he
 One expert joked that the scope of his eyesight goes to China
 magar iageies kaa safaya karne ke unke ghoshit iraade ko dekhte hue ve yah gavaara nahin kar sakate ki afghanistan se alag ho jaaen or use phir se islamic ugravadi haathon main jane den
 Their real test will be when tensions between India and Pakistan escalate and after a major attack both sides get entangled in a limited war
 aise main trump bharat kii tarafdaari karenge yaa nahin, khaskar tab jab donon paksh parmaanu hathiyaaron se las hai? yah ahm sawaal he kyonki parmaanu hathiyaaron ko lekar trump kaa ravaiya laaparvaah rahaa he
 He has spoken of allowing Japan and South Korea to build nuclear weapons, so that America does not need to make more nuclear weapons
 duusare log daleel dete hai ki trump jab tak america kaa koi sidhaa phayda nahin dekhte, tab tak faujee takat kaa istemaal karne ke anicchhuk honge
 In such a situation, they will emphasize more reconciliation in areas of conflict and relationships
 agar aisa hota he, to unke shvinash purushya hone ko lekar faili ashankaayen or andeh dur ho jaaenge or unki jagah aashaaen jagengi
 Winning is the most important thing in life for Trump
 yah baat na sirf america balki duniya bhar ke logon se nibatate samay unhen or bhi zyada dimag main rakhni hogi
