 upie sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi samaajawaadee party (sapa) khaadya suraksha vidheyak ke mudde par somvaar ko vam dalon ke saath ho gai or kaha ki yah kisaan virdohi he or unhen samuchit bhugtan se vanchit kar degaa
 SP leader Naresh Aggarwal said, "on the day this bill will be implemented, farmers will not get proper payment for their produce
 ’ unhone ashanka jataai ki is vidheyak ko laakar sarkaar madhyavadhi chunaav kii ore dekh rahi he
 He said, 'SP opposes this bill because it is anti-farmer
 ’ vidheyak ke vartmaan swaroop kaa virodh karte huye vam dalon ne maang kii ki unke dwaara laae gaye sanshodhan par ‘gambhirtha’ se vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 CPI (M) leader Vrinda Karat said, "this should be discussed and the amendments brought by the party should be seriously considered
" ’ khaadya suraksha par ek adhyadesh laae jane ke vichaar kaa kadaa virodh karte huye bhakpa ne kaha ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak apane vartmaan rup main ‘khamiyukt or asweekaarya’ he or vyapak charchaa ke baad isamen kaaphi badlaav kii jarurat he
 cpi's d Raja said that the Food Security Bill being brought by the UPA government is unacceptable in its present form as it has many flaws
 party ke netaa atul anjaan ne kaha ki agar sarkaar is mudde par gambhir he to use jald hi sarvadaleey baithak bulani chahie
 On the other hand, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed surprise that at a time when the general elections are 'over the head', at that time without full implementation mechanism, the UPA government is showing haste in bringing the Food Security Bill
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ko 2019 main satta se hataane ke liye vipaksh main ekajutata kii koshishen tej ho gai hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is active in the exercise to form a third front
 mamata ne dilli main vipakshi dalon ke tamaam netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kii or uske baad congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi se bhi milin
 After meeting Sonia, Mamata gave a one-to-one fight formula for 2019 to defeat Modi
 sonia gandhi or congress ko mamata kaa ye formula raas aayaa yaa nahin, isko lekar party ne koi sanket nahin die hai lekin raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to rahul ke netritv vaali congress ko mamata kaa ye formula shaayad hi manjuur ho
 Mamta said about meeting Sonia, 'I told her that the party where it is strong, should fight it vigorously
 ham chaahate hai ki congress kshetreey dalon ko bijepi se mukaable ke liye madad kare
 This one-to-one fight will end the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bijepi ke asantusht netaa arun shouri ne kaha ki van tu van formule se modi ke aasaani se haraaya ja saktaa he
 The task of coordination and seat sharing should be given to a very strong leader of the state
 modi ke khilaaf vipaksh ko 69 pratishat vot kaa target rakhana chahie
 According to Mamta's one-to-one formula, SP-BSP in UP, Lalu's RJD in Bihar, NCP in Maharashtra
 tamilnadu main diemke or pashchim bengal main khud mamata banerjee kii party kii bolbalaa he
 There are 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, 42 in West Bengal, 40 in Bihar, 48 in Maharashtra and 39 seats in Tamil Nadu
 yani kul milakar kareeb aadhi siton par mamata chaahati hai ki congress sthaneey dalon ke saamne sarender kar de
 It is true that Congress is the junior partner (SP, BSP, TMC, Left parties, RJD and DMK) in these five states
 aise main uske liye yahaan sambhaavnaaen kaaphi simit hai
 If accepted by Mamta's formula, the Congress will depend on the wishes of regional parties here
 sawaal uthta he ki congress agar is formule ko maan bhi leti he to use phayda kya hoga
 In other states where it is going to fight alone like Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, these small parties will not give any benefit to it
 phir congress bina kisi phaayde ke in dalon ke prabhaav vaale rajyon kii apni sambhaavnaaen bhala kyon qurbaan karegi
 In the assembly elections, the regional parties are dominated in the same way, the Gandhi brand of the party is able to show some strength in the Lok Sabha itself, if the party is like the junior partner of these parties in the Lok Sabha elections, then its revival hopes will end forever
 
 party apane bhavishya ko lekar ye jokhim mol legi aisa lagata nahin he
 In fact, the Congress is also trying to unite these satraps in 2019 and contest against Modi
 lekin congress junior partner ke taur par nahin balki gathbandhan ke sabase majboot dal ke rup main isaki aguwai karnaa chaahati he
 In such a situation, Mamata's formula is opposite to the intentions of the Congress
 jaahir he congress ke liye ise swikaarna aasaan nahin hoga

 This campaign was a successful success and about two thousand people participated in it
 gullu ne iske baad aas-paas ke hotalon main waiter kaa kaam karne vaale ladakon ko lekar nayaa abhiyaan shuru kiya
 This time the reason for the protest was to increase the price of bread and pay less to the waiters
 gullu kii chhavi kamobesh robinhood kii ban rahi thi
 Her neighbors say that Gullu's mustache was very popular
 wo anyaay nahin sahataa tha
 Once some people were teasing women, Gullu beat them fiercely
 ye saare kisse us daur ke hai jab gullu pakistan main mashhoor nahin hue the
 According to locals, Gullu used to visit the office of Nawaz Sharif's party PML (N) daily
 piemail ke ek kaaryakarta ke anusaar mukhyamantri shahbaaj sharif ne gullu se prabhavit hokar unhen sher-e-punjab kaa khitaab diya tha
 Although many times he is compared to Raja Bhaiya of India i
e
 Bahubali minister of UP Raghuraj Pratap Singh
 unke ek mitra ne bataaya kii hamane internet par unki ek tasviir dekhi or tab se kuch log dono main samanta dhundne lage jabaki aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 Gullu attempted self-immolation after the imposition of President's rule in 2009
 is ghatana ke baad gullu pehali baar puure pakistan main charchaa main aa gaye the
 a PML worker, who described himself as Gullu's friend, said that Gullu is good at heart but political leaders made him a scapegoat
 gullu kii police mukhyalay ke paas park kaaron par khadey hokar pradarshan karne kii tasviren bahut mashhoor hui
 During this time many policemen came and hugged Gullu
 aisi khabaren bhi udi ki gullu police ke agent ke taur par kaam kar rahe hai
 Gullu's name came up after this in several consecutive riots and criminal incidents
 un par gambhir mukademen darj hue
 Always careful about his image, Gullu tried to make his image as an ordinary man in the media
 lekin is chhavi kaa un jaj sahab par koi fark nahin padaa jo gullu ke mukademe kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 Gullu wanted to work in films but does not think that his desire will be fulfilled as he has been sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment for killing 11 people

 Yadav said that instead of apologizing to me, you should have apologized to thousands of supporters and countrymen
 saath hi unhone kapil ko ye naseehat bhi di ki wo kejariwal par roj-roj aarope lagaana band karen
 After this letter from Yogendra Yadav, Kapil also replied
 unhone kaha ki jab tak ghotaalon kii jaankaree saamne nahin aegi, main chup nahin baithunga
 Read the complete letter of Yogendra Yadav
 
 
 kapil bhai,kal press conference main aapaki kshamayachna suni
 i felt that instead of apologizing to Prashant ji and me (and also to Anand ji and Ajit bhai), i should have apologized to the thousands of volunteers, millions of supporters and crores of countrymen who have been cheated
 mujhe acha laga ki aapane bhi shaam tak meri is baat kaa samarthan kiya
 Who does not make mistakes, but not everyone dares to apologize
 bahut vakt biit gaya he, phir bhi aapaki saarvajanik kshamayachna se kai doston ke puraane ghaav bharne main madad milegi
 When we were expelled from the party using false stigma
 us vakt (khaastaur par kelista resort cond main) aapaki or apane kai saathiyon kii bhoomika dekhakar meraa insaaniyat se bharosa hill gaya tha
 On your special request, i went to campaign in your constituency several times
 sochiye mujhe kaisaa laga hoga jab aapke hi munh se gaddari kaa aarope suna or aapkaa aadarneey shanti bhushan ji par hamalaa, ab bhi yaad kar sihar uthta hum
 You have indicated the truth of that incident, but if you ever understand well, then you will put the whole truth of that incident in front of the country
 aaj aapaki kshamayachna main mujhe un kai puraane saathiyon kii bhi awaz bhi suni jo apane kiye par sharminda mahasoos karte hai
 They have been secretly sending messages of apology, but are unable to speak openly
 use sunakar mere bheetar agar koi kadavaahat bachi thi to wo dhul gai
 By the way, you are very smart with me in politics, but if you do not take otherwise, then i should give a suggestion, stop these press conferences against Arvind Kejriwal every day
 main nahin kahata ki aapke saare aarope galat hai
 Some of the allegations are weighty, although there is no evidence for the rest
 lekin din-raat aaropon kii jhadi sunne se aam aadmi party to saafe nahin hogi, eemaandaar raajnneeti main janata kii jitani bhi aasthaa bachi he wo jarur saafe ho jaaegi
 If you knew all this, what were you doing there for the last two years? Today, atonement suits you, not vengeance
 kapil bhai, nakaaratmakataa kii raajnneeti na desh ke hit main he, na hi aapke hit main
 For the last two years, i have spent most of my time on the question of village-farming-farmer
 meraa yakeen maano, aam aadmi party ke netaaon ke kukarm is desh kii sabase badi samasya nahin he
 As Faiz said, there are more sorrows in the world
 shubhakamanaayon sahit,aapkaa agrajayogendra yadavais patr ke baad kapil mishra ne jawaab main kaha ki puraa prakatikaran to hona hi chahie aapaki is baat se sahamat hum
 When the information about the scams comes, i will do a press conference
 chup nahin rahoonga
 Let me tell you that Kapil Mishra had claimed Arvind Kejriwal with his close associates to raise party funds through fake companies
 saath hi kapil ne aarope lagaaya tha ki aam aadmi party ne hawala ke jariye party fund ke naam par kaledhan ko safed karne kaa kaam kiya
 Kapil had also complained about the case by going to CBI and CBDT
 is bich lokayukta ne mukhyamantri kejariwal or unke mantri satyendra jain ke khilaaf lagaae bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke silsile main kapil mishra ko gavaahi ke liye bulaayaa he
 After being sacked by the Delhi cabinet, Kapil Mishra accused Arvind Kejriwal of covering up the tanker scam and taking Rs 2 crore from Satyendar Jain, a minister in the Delhi government

 jieselvi di 5 kaa prakshepan pichley saal 19 agast ko kiya janaa tha lekin eendhan li hone ke baad antim samay main prakshepan sthagit kar diya gaya tha
 ISRO then sent the vehicle to the Vehicle Assembly Building and rectified the errors

 This time the ISRO officials were very cautious to remove any problem to avoid failure

 Along with this, detailed ground tests and improvements were also made
 jo sudhaar kiye gaye hai usamen nichle aavaran kii phir se digining karnaa shaamil he
 This protects the cryogenic engine of GSLV-D5 during flight in the atmosphere
 iske atirikt cryo stage ke vir tunnel kii bhi phir se digining kii gai taaki vah udaan main bade balon ko sah sake

 Several suggestions have been given: These suggestions include many important things
 abhi bhi bahut si ladakiyon ko sirf isliye college nahi bheja jaataa kyonki parivaar ke paas itnaa paisa nahi hota or kalege me ladakiyon ke mukaable ladakon ko padhaane par praathamikta di jaati he

 Right now it depends on the will of all the institutes whether they participate in this ranking or not

 There was also a big suggestion that the National Education Service should also be started with the service so that education officers should play an important role in the institutions

 ravivaar ko purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne 126 se 132 seat jeet kii bhavishyavaanee kii
 Earlier, party state president Kamal Nath had said that the Congress would win more than 140 seats
 media se baat karte hue digvijay singh ne kaha ki main pichley ek saal se puure pradesh main gum rahaa hum
 After voting, i can say with confidence that the Congress is forming the government with a majority by winning 126 to 132 seats
 haalanki, digvijay singh kii bhavishyavaanee unke hi party ke duusare senior netaa kamalnath se kam he
 He gave a different figure soon after the voting was over
 kamalnath ne kaha tha, 'maine pehle kaha tha ki ham 140 se zyada siten jeetenge, lekin voting pratishat dekhakar lag rahaa he ki nattejey or bhi zyada chaunkaane vaale rahenge
 'let me tell you, earlier Digvijay Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not want Shivraj Singh Chauhan in MP, Vasundhara Raje Scindia in Rajasthan and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh
 iviem par sawaal uthaate hue unhone kaha ki hamen is par bharosa nahin he, lekin modi khud chaahate hai ki yah teenon netaa haare toiviemmen gadabadi nahin hogi, kyonki iviem kii chaabi modi ke paas he
 However, everyone is waiting for the result, but before that it is being predicted fiercely
 haalanki, madhya pradesh main counting se pehle iviem ko lekar gahamagahami shuru ho gai he
 The result of Madhya Pradesh election will come on December 11
 rajya main kul 230 siton par voting hui thi or sarkaar banane ke liye 116 ke jaadui aakande kii jarurat hoti he
 In such a situation, even though Digvijay's figure is less than Kamal Nath, the Congress is predicted to form the government in both the cases

 That is, the goal of getting a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own
 
 
 vaise, ullekhneey he ki varsh 1984 ke baad se kisi bhi ek dal ko loksabhaa main kabhi bahumat nahin mila he, isiilie is lakshya ko bhale hi asambhav na mana ja rahaa ho, behad kathin to yah he hi
 
 
 Even under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP could not move ahead of 182 seats, so the BJP under Narendra Modi has set a very difficult target
 
 
 lekin modi is bade lakshya ke saath ek chote, magar mahatvapurn lakshya ke liye bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 
 
 That is 'mission 26', that is, to put all 26 Lok Sabha seats of his state Gujarat in bjp's account
 
 
 agar sitambar, 1996 se march, 1998 ke bich kii avadhi ko chhod den, to gujarat main march, 1995 se hi bijepi satta main he
 
 
 This is a major achievement for the BJP, which is considered the party of North India
 
 
 maujuuda mukhyamantri narendra modi bhi 7 oktober, 2001 se hi lagaataar pad par hai
 
 
 Since the 2002 Gujarat riots, Narendra Modi has been talking about Gujarati identity
 
 
 unka koi bhi bayaan pehle paanch karod gujarati or ab chah karod gujaratiyon kaa zikr kiye bina puraa nahin hota
 
 
 Now Modi is trying to define this Gujarati identity in a new way
 
 
 yani, kisi gujarati kaa desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa
 
 
 At the national level, he has introduced this Gujarati identity to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 
 
 vah kehete rahe hai ki sardaar patel ke saath anyaay hua, kyonki bharat ke swatantra hone ke baad sardaar patel ko pradhanmantri bananaa tha, lekin unki jagah pandit jawaharlal nehru ko pradhanmantri banwaaya gaya
 
 
 Morarji Desai was definitely a Gujarati who was Prime Minister for two years, but due to internal differences within the Janata Party, he did not get a chance to complete his term
 
 
 varsh 2007 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke vakt bijepi ne aanan-fanan laalkrishna adwani ko apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 
 
 With the argument that declaring a leader representing Gujarat in the Lok Sabha as the PM candidate will benefit the BJP in the assembly elections
 
 
 haalanki kuch party netaa dabi jubaan main kehete hai ki asli makasad yah tha ki kahin varsh 2007 ke chunaav main jeetne ke baad narendra modi piem pad ke daavedaar na ho jaaen
 
 
 Despite this, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was able to win only 15 out of 26 seats in Gujarat
 
 
 varsh 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke pradarshan ke hisaab se bijepi 22 loksabhaa siten jeetne kii sthiti main he
 
 
 By applying a little more emphasis, BJP can reach this figure of 25 by winning Patan, Dahod and Banaskantha seats too
 
 
 party ab inhen koshishon main lagi he
 
 
 Keshubhai Patel's Gujarat Parivartan Party, which rebelled against Narendra Modi and formed a separate party, has merged with the BJP
 
 
 somvaar ko hi do or congressi vidhayakon ne vidhansabha se istipha dekar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 
 
 Seven Congress mlas and one MP have joined BJP in the last one year
 
 
 vyaktigat taur par narendra modi ke liye yah jaruri he ki bijepi gujarat main ab tak kaa behtareen pradarshan kare
 
 
 He himself is going to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Gujarat itself
 
 
 sambhaavna he ki vah ahmedabad purv yaa phir vadodara se loksabhaa chunaav laden
 
 
 Of course, like Mission 272+ for Narendra Modi, 'mission 26' of Gujarat is also very important

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) South African fast bowler Morne Morkel fired a literal arrow at Team India ahead of the two-test series starting here on December 18, saying that the young Indian batsmen would miss 'sachin Tendulkar's patience' on the field and they should be given the home team's Should be ready to face aggressive bowling
 morkal ne kaha ki yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki bharat ke yuva ballebaaj kis tarah dakshin africa ke tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karte hai or vah bhi tab jabaki tendulkar jaisaa khilaadi unki team kaa hissaa nahin he
 Morkel said, "sachin is a batsman who can bat for a long time
" vah lambey samay tak ballebaaji karke gendbaajon or virdohi team ko dabaav main daal saktaa he
 That was his batting pillar
 vah sheersh kram or madhya kram donon ke saath ballebaaji kar saktaa tha
 ' unhone kaha, 'bharat ke yuva ballebaaj vishwa stareey khilaadi hai lekin ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa se ham spasht dekh sakate hai ki ve aakraamak ballebaaj hai jinhen gendbaajon ko nishaanaa bananaa pasand he
 It will be interesting to see how they perform
 ' After playing the 200th Test of his career against the West Indies in Mumbai last month, Tendulkar retired from all forms of cricket
 morkal ne kaha, 'jaisaa ki maine kaha ve achche khilaadi he
 Rohit Sharma is in good form and Cheteshwar Pujara can bat for long at number three
 yahaan tak ki aar aswin kaa ausat 40 he
 Therefore, we have to take advantage of the favorable conditions of bowling in the morning with the new ball
 hamen buudhvaar se hi acha pradarshan karnaa hoga, anyathaa ve teji se ran bana sakate hai or wanders main kabhi kabhi kaaphi adhik ran banate hai
 ' yah poochne par ki kya unhone jaanboojhkar viraat kohli kaa naam nahin liya yaa dakshin africa unhen khatre ke rup main nahin dekhtaa, morkal ne is bare main koi thos jawaab nahin diya
 He said, 'virat did well in Australia
 vah acha khilaadi he
 But of course he will land in the role of Sachin and he has to fill a bigger space
 vah acha pradarshan kar saktaa he
 But he will have a good exam at number four
 ' The Indian team management has so far made no formal statement as to who will bat at number four but Kohli batted with Poojara during the net session at Benoni on Friday and yesterday
 bijepi ne jab jammu evam kashmir vidhansabha chunaav main mishan 44 plus kaa elaan kiya tha, uski ummiido ke aadhaar main kashmiri panditon ke vot bhi shumaar the, lekin poling ke aankade bataate hai ki kashmiri panditon ne bijepi kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood voting main dilchaspee hi nahin dikhaai, so, nattejey ke taur par ho saktaa he ki bijepi kaa kashmir ghati main khaataa bhi na khule
 This is also important because ensuring a single vote of Kashmiri Pandits was part of the bjp's strategy, but despite this the party could not do so
 vaadi main, jahaan hurriyat jaise algaavvaadi sanghathanon kii pole bycott kii apil ke chalate kai siton par bahut kam voting hoti he, panditon kaa ekamusth vot chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit kar saktaa tha
 Srinagar district has eight assembly constituencies
 hubbakadal vah kshetra he, jahaan kashmiri pandit votaron kii taadaad sabase zyaada he
 Out of the total 32,136 migrant Kashmiri Pandit Votto of the plaintiff, 17,470 belong to this place
 lekin vot kiya sirf 2,817 ne
 The same was the case with the Amirakadal, where only 837 out of 5,275 Kashmiri Pandits voted
 jabaki hazaratbal ke 2,599 panditon main se sirf 360 ne vot daale
 Out of 32,136 Pandit votes in the entire Srinagar district, only 5,169 votes were cast
 ve bhi tab, jab 9,638 migrant kashmiri panditon ne em-form bharkar vot dene kii manshaa jataai thi, yani jo vot daalane kaa man bana chuke the, ve bhi poling booth tak nahin aae
 Additional DC GM Darr of Srinagar, who is also the nodal officer of election responsibilities, states that a total of 440 pundits had issued postal ballots, out of which only 136 voted and sent back the ballot
 mangalvaar subah tak isamen kuch or izaafe kii ummid he
 The BJP is expected to perform well in Jammu division where there are 37 seats, but it wants to see its victory flag waving by winning some seats out of 46 seats in Kashmir
 hubbakadal main kul 54,852 matadaata hai, jinamein sirf 11,561 ne vot daale
 This is the highest voting in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 2008 assembly elections and many earlier elections
 is seat par pidipi ke jafar mehraj kii qismat bhi daanv par he
 He does not want to speak on why the BJP did not woo the Kashmiri Pandits, but he is expected to benefit from the aggressive campaigning style of the BJP and the controversy over conversion
 duusari taraf, kashmiri pandit sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh sanjay tikku kaa kahana he ki migrant voter kaa haq paane ko lekar bahut sari kanoonee or kaagazati mushkilen hai
 This is a big reason for Kashmiri Pandits' votes falling short
 is daleel main dam ho saktaa he, lekin sawaal he ki jis bijepi ne kashmir ko lekar itnaa qamar kasi thi, kya uskaa dhyaan is taraf pehle nahin gaya
 
 
 The While the party hopes to do well in Jammu, the hope of winning one of the 46 seats in the valley has also been eclipsed
 bijepi ne kashmir vaadi main agar koi ek seat jeetne kii sabase zyaada ummid lagaai he, to vah hubbakadal kii he, lekin ek taraf jahaan kashmiri panditon kaa vot nahin aayaa, vahiin duusari taraf yahaan logon ne pehle se zyaada vot kiya, taaki boycott kaa nuksaan bijepi kaa phayda na ban jaae

 time ke is cover par duniyabar main bavaal much gaya tha
 However, TIME has changed exactly 6 days after the election results
 mangalvaar ko megsine ne apane ek artical main narendra modi ko desh ko jodne vaala bataaya he
 TIME has written that what no Prime Minister could do in decades, Narendra Modi did it
 darasal, TIME megsine par ek opinian artical chapa he jiskaa tital he ‘modi has united India like no Prime Minister in decades’ yani dashakon main jo koi anya pradhanmantri nahin kar sakaa, us tarah narendra modi ne bharat ko jod diya

 com / iqjfeeaanw— TIME (@TIME) May 9, 2019 The biggest achievement of this election in the article has stated that Narendra Modi has eliminated casteism which has been going on in the country for a long time and unitedly got the votes of the people
 narendra modi ne pichhadi jati ke logon ko apane haq main laane main kamyaabi pai he, lekin western media abhi bhi narendra modi ko agadi jati ke netaa ke taur par project kar rahaa tha
 The article wrote praising Narendra Modi, how he, despite being from a poor family, made it to the biggest post in the country and fought a political battle with the Gandhi family
 lekhak ne likhaa ki pichley paanch saal main kai aalochanaon ke baad bhi jis tarah narendra modi ne desh ko ek sutara main piroyaa he, vaisaa pichley paanch dashak main koi pradhanmantri nahin kar paaya
 (screenshot of new article) Let us know that on May 10, the magazine had printed a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on its cover
 iskaa tital ‘divider in Chief’ diya gaya tha yani baantne waalon kaa pramukh
 There was a lot of ruckus in the country

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday targeted the Narendra Modi government after the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed by Parliament, saying that the 'bill to sabotage the soul of the Constitution' has been brought when the government came to be the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi The drummer is beating priyanka ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bayaan ko share karte hue twit kiya, ‘bhaajapa jis samay mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti manaane kaa dhindhora peet rahi he usee dauraan (sarkaar) naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak jaisaa bhedbhaavpurn va samvidhan kii aatma ko chalni karne vaala vidheyak laai
 'he said,' The Congress will fight strongly against the divisive intentions of the BJP

 At the same time, the BJP is pushing for the completion of 150 years of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, at the same time, it is bringing a discriminatory cab-like and deceitful bill of the Constitution

 loksabhaa ne somvaar raat is vidheyak ko manjuuri di thi
 The bill provides for making people from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India due to religious persecution from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship
 congress ne karnataka ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bacseet par aana sweekaar karke bijepi ko haar kaa swaad chakhaa diya he
 Its strategy was made in Delhi and Congress strategists became active to implement it
 in ranneetikaron main party mahasachiv ashok gahalot bhi shaamil the jinhone bijepi ke liye haar kii kahani taiyaar kii
 Former Rajasthan CM Gehlot has earlier caused a headache for the BJP in Gujarat
 karnataka main jedies ke saath gathbandhan main jane kii baat kehane vaale sabase pehle netaa ashok gahalot hi the
 The Congress hoped to form the government on its own in Karnataka
 lekin 15 may ko matganana se pehle jaise hi congress ko apane number kam padate lage ashok gahalot media ke saamne aae or unhone congress kii ranneeti ke mutabik raajnneeti main vikalp khule hone kii baat kahi or ishaara kar diya ki karnataka ke raajnneetik sameekaran ab kahaan jane vaale hai
 a meeting of senior leaders with Rahul was chalked out in Delhi and leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ashok Gehlot were sent to Karnataka to implement it
 uske baad vidhayakon ko bachaane or jedies ko paale main laane kii kavayad shuru hui
 The result of which is in front of everyone
 yediurppa or bijepi se congress ne jis tarah na sirf apane balki nirdaleey or jedies ke vidhayakon tak ko bachaakar rakhaa, wo bataata he ki is baar party kis had tak taiyaari ke saath maidan main utari thi
 Ashok Gehlot played a key role in helping Ahmed Patel win the Rajya Sabha election while he was in charge of modi-shah's stronghold
 tab bhi gujarat ke congressi vidhayakon ko bijepi se bachaane ke liye karnataka ke eagleton resort main hi rakhaa gaya tha
 He was brought to Gujarat a day before the election
 bijepi ke chanakya kahe jane vaale amit shah ne ahamed patel ko haraane ke liye puraa jor lagaaya tha, lekin aadhi raat tak bane suspence ke baad aakhirkaar jeet patel kii hi hui or gahalot ne congress netritv kaa bharosa jeeta
 Damashok Gehlot's strategic success was shown in Gujarat assembly elections in Gujarat assembly elections
 chunaav prachaar se pehle congress ke 25-35 siton tak simtane kii ummid lagaai ja rahi thi
 But Gehlot had proved all the speculations wrong by giving Rahul Gandhi the mantra of soft Hindutva
 unki ranneeti kaa hi kamaal tha ki bijepi 115 se 99 siton par atak gai thi or vah congress ko 61 se 77 siton par le aae the
 With such an increase in Congress, Ashok Gehlot's close proximity to Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot's track record has also been very successful
 mul rup se rajasthan ke gahalot pehle soshal media par apni pratidwandvi or bijepi kii siem vasundhara raaje sindhiya par hi nishaanaa sadhate dikhte the
 These days he surrounds PM Modi against his policies
 karnataka chunaav ke baad modi ke nepal ke mandir main jaakar puja karne par unhone hi sawaal uthaae the or kaha tha ki modi ko aise apratyaksh chunaav prachaar band karne chahie

 ’ Team India's ODI and T20 cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said amidst the uproar over the organization of IPL matches in drought-prone Maharashtra, changing venue matches is not a solution to this enduring crisis as it needs a long-term solution
 jabamahendra singh dhonise maharashtra main sookhe ke bare main unke vichaar dene ke liye poocha gaya to dhoni ne kaha, ‘agar aap dekho to ye sabhi sawaal sunne main achche lagate hai, mujhe lagata he ki iskaa dirghakaalik hal karnaa jaruri he
 There is a potable water crisis in the state, leading to a lot of controversy over the conduct of IPL matches and a public interest petition was filed in the Bombay High Court challenging the use of large amounts of water for the maintenance of the stadium pitches
 isseipalkesabhi maichonko maharashtra se baahar karne kii maang kii ja rahi he
 a total of 20 matches will be played in the three major cities of Maharashtra, Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, one of which has been played at Wankhedstedium on Saturday
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘ipel kaa paanchvaan, chatha yaa saatvaan match ho yaa nahin, mujhe nahin lagata ki isse kuch zyada fark padegaa
 'he said,' But we have to find a solution for this for a long time
 ham kis tarah se sunishchit karen ki jahaan pani kii kami ho, pani un ilaakon main bheja jaae
 Dhoni said, "what i have seen on TV, there are some dams where only one or two per cent water is left

 One of the best wins in my presence: After the collective failure of the players in Dhoni Australia, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his fellow selectors will have to balance to bring Indian cricket back on track
 chayan samiti par australia main kharaab pradarshan karne vaale khilaadiyon ko team se baahar karne ke liye desh ke karodon cricket premiyon kaa dabaav hoga
 This is the best innings of my career: Kohli will now have to see whether the selectors have suffered from poor form on the current tour, with senior batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag and junior players Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja rested or excluded from the team Whether or not the young give players a chance
 abhi yah spasht nahin he ki pichley kuch samay se lagaataar cricket khel rahe captainmahendra singh dhoniko 11 se 22 march tak dhaka main hone vaale toornament ke liye aaraam diya jaataa he yaa nahin
 India are the defending champions and five-time winners and there is no expectation of a major reshuffle in the team but some changes are expected after the team's poor performance in two consecutive overseas tours in England and Australia
 team main kuch choton kii samasya bhi hai
 Fast bowler r Vinay Kumar and all-rounder Irfan Pathan are injured
 team main amulchul badlaav ke liye rigerv khilaadiyon kaa bada pool maujuud hona chahie lekin maujuuda kshetreey ekadivasiy toornament main pradarshan ko dekhte hue adhik vikalp uplabdh nahin hai
 Irfan's brother Yusuf has started playing after the injury and has scored a century against Saurashtra two days ago with the help of 10 sixes and six fours to show him how to turn the match dice on sub-continent pitches suited to his batting style
 Are capable
 jadeja australia main vifal rahe jabaki test visheshgy pragyan ojha bhi maujuuda gharelu vanade toornament main kaaphi wicket chatakaane main naakaam rahe hai
 However, Yusuf is expected to return to the team due to his all-round ability

 Hyderabad's d Ravi Teja is the top scorer with 354 runs in five matches while Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik is second with 302 runs
 teja aakraamak ballebaaj ke alaava upyogi leg spinner bhi hai jabaki dhoni ko aaraam dene kii sthiti main antarrashtriya anubhav ke kaaran karthik ko mauka mil saktaa he
 Number two wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha after Dhoni in the Test would also have caught the attention of the selectors after a good performance for Bengal in the ODI League
 unhone teen maichon main 206 ran banaae hai
 Apart from this, Dheeraj Jadhav of Assam, Ganesh Satish of Karnataka, Saurashtra young batsman Chirag Jani, Swapnil Asnodkar of Goa and Ankit Bawne of Maharashtra have also done well in regional odis
 gendbaaji vibhaag main haalanki adhik vikalp nahin hai
 The selectors may, however, consider the names of Munaf Patel and Ashish Nehra, who were members of the World Cup winning team, who are struggling with injuries
 bengal ke tej gendbaaj ashok dinda gharelu toornament main shandaar form main rahe hai or team main lambey samay baad vaapasi kar sakate hai

 Delhi veteran Parvinder Awana and Railway's Shailendra Gehlot have also impressed
 karnataka ke abhimanyu mithun or maharashtra ke baayen haath ke spinner akshay darekar bhi prabhavi pradarshan karne main safal rahe hai
 In response, the Indian batsmen did a performance that was probably not expected by Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan, who started the innings with a partnership of 178 runs for the first wicket

 bataa den ki van aviation privet limited kaa embrar ( Embraer) jet duniya ke sabase aaleeshaan hawaii jahaajon main se ek he
 But from the facts that have come out, it is clear that the Indian owners of this aircraft are skipping in its maintenance and are not even following the guidelines of the regulator

 Keeping in view the NDTV investigation, Pawan Kumar of DGCA has issued summons to the officer of Air One

 haalanki, embraer kaa kahana he ki bharat main uskaa koi bhi adhikrut seva centre nahin he
 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has found that Air One does not have qualified staff and advanced equipment to normally maintain and repair Embraer lineage jets made by Brazil
 khaas baat he ki mumbai se kareeb 1,000 kilometre dur gondia main aisa koi seva centre nahin he, jo brazil ke vimaan nirmaataaon kii adhikrut seva kendron kii suchi main shaamil ho
 However, it is being told that the DDCA had once given permission to service the aircraft in Gondia

 Surprisingly, the aircraft opened in January and was flown to Gondia on 26 December

 NDTV found that the Embraer aircraft machine for routine repair work was open in Gondia, Maharashtra, while it required a dust-free environment during the repair and did not have the regulator's permission to do so

 In one picture, the snake is seen under the clothes, while in the second picture the snake is seen on the forest side
 kai log video ko dekhakar kaaphi hans rahe hai to koi is ghatana ko kaaphi khatarnaak bataa rahaa he
 Later it was revealed that it is a corn snake

 So far, about 50 families have returned home, in fact, Hindu organizations have alleged that these families were forced to accept Christianity by giving temptation
 aise main ab in pariwaron ko waapas hindu dharm main laayaa ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, regarding the allegations of conversion, the organization says that this is not a conversion, but a return of the Hindus
 bataaya jaataa he kii ab tak kareeb 50 pariwaron kii ghar vaapasi karwaai gai he

 mishanrij par ye aarope bhi lagate rahe hai ki is kaam kii aad main ye sanghathan pralobhan dekar adivaasiyon ko dharm parivartan kara isai banane main lage hai
 However, people associated with Christianity continue to deny accusations of forced conversion

 uttar pradesh main congress ko sanbhaalane ke liye priyanka gandhi bhale hi aa gai hon, lekin congress ke bheetar gutbaji dur hona abhi dur kii kaudi lagati he
 At the same time, the most attractive face of the Gandhi family has been fielded to unite Congress and make BJP face-off, at the same time, the foundation of factionalism has been started from Bundelkhand
 isaki shuruyaat samthar riyasat ke raja ranjit singh judev ne kii
 Ranjit Singh is the state vice president of the Congress
 singh ne jhaansi ke sabase prabhaavshaalee netaa maane jane vaale pradeep jain ko tikat nahin dene kii pairvi kii he, saath hi tikat ke liye jin logon ke naamon kii sifarish kii he wo jamini sangharsh main pradeep ke aage kahin nahin tikte
 After this, a fierce battle has started within the Congress in Jhansi, but the people of Jhansi have started saying on this pride, this is a fight between Raja and Ranka, which will continue
 raja ranjit singh judev kaa naam congress ke kaaphi senior or kaddavar netaaon main shumaar he
 He won the elections from Samathar Garutha seat seven times and was also a minister in the state government, but after losing four consecutive elections, he also went to political fringe
 congress pradesh upaadhyaksh ranjit singh judev ne purv mantri pradeep jainaka virodh karte hue jhaansi seat se congress sachiv sudhanshu treepathi, bhanu sahay, rahul richaaria, rajendra singh yadav kaa naam loksabhaa tikat ke liye aage badhaayaa he
 Ranjit Singh himself expressed his desire to contest the election at the behest of the high command, but none of the leaders are active on the ground except for Bhanu Sahai alone in the names he has put forward
 sudhanshu treepathi to hawaii netaaon main hi gine jate hai
 Ranjit Singh Judeo says, "I have spoken of cutting the tickets of the leaders who have forfeited their bail
 " pradeep jain kii loksabhaa main jamaanat jabt ho gai thi, lekin babina vidhansabha se buree tarah jamaanat jabt kara chuke rajendra singh yadav ke naam kii sifarish loksabhaa chunaav ke liye karne par uthe sawaal par ranjit singh kehete hai, "ve to pichhadaa varg ke netaa hai
 "manoj Reza, a social worker from Jhansi, believes that Ranjit Singh Judeo is the king of Samathar princely state and like Pradeep Jain Ranka who rises from the ground before him
 aise main jab koi raja ko bada hota dikhne lage to uske par katarma bhi to siyasat kaa hi hissaa he
 Whereas, according to the local people of Jhansi, there is no candidate for the Jhansi seat in the Congress against Pradeep Jain
 patrkaar divakar pande kii maane to ranjit singh judev ne ain chunaav ke maukey par congress kii gutbaji ko hawa de di he, jo chunaav main congress ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 This is happening when the Congress has sent its most attractive face Priyanka Gandhi on a mission to strengthen the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 yahi haal rahaa to kanges kaa siyaasi taur par majboot hona chunauti bharaa hoga
 Pradeep got credit for winning the Congress in difficult times, when the Congress had a difficult time, then Pradeep Jain Aditya won the Congress from Jhansi Sadar seat, which is considered a stronghold of BJP
 vah yahaan se do baar vidhansabha chunaav jite
 And in the 2009 Lok Sabha election, when he was fielded by the Congress from Jhansi Lok Sabha seat, he won the election from here and opened the account of the Congress, which is desperate for a simple victory in Bundelkhand
 is jeet ke saath hi unhen upie 2 main gramin vikaas rajya mantri bana diya gaya
 But Pradeep Jain's bail was forfeited in the 2014 Lok Sabha election amid a Modi wave
 ab yaheen se unke bhavishya par sawaal bhi khadey hone laga
 The question is also because he also contested and lost the election of Jhansi Mayor
 is par pradeep jain aditya kehete hai, "main har samay congress ko majboot or har str par jivit banaae rakhane kii sochataa hum
 When no one was ready to contest from the Congress in the election of Mayor, i had to contest the election

 But the 30-year-old Mohammed Javed, who lives in village Bhadeethi in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh, never had a feeling of self-alienation in his heart
 isiilie to bhadethi samet aasapaas ke aadha darjan se adhik gaanvon main rahane vaale logon kii takalifon or jarurat ko dekhte hue unhone beson nadi par apane paison se 40 meter lambey pul kaa nirmaan karavaaya he
 It costs about 35 lakhs
 kii laagat ai
 His village is situated on the banks of the river Beso, which has a population of about 3,500
 yah nadi bhadethi or bhado gaanv ke bich bahati he, jis par pul na hone ke kaaran logon ko kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 They would either have to swim or wait for a boat on the river for hours
 aakhir jarurat kii sari chijen ek hi gaanv main to muhaiyaa hoti nahin
 Therefore going across the river was also a necessity and helplessness
 tabhi javed ne nadi par pul banane kaa faisla kiya
 He says, "there was a problem of crossing the river for everyday tasks, as well as a lot of difficulty in the marriage of daughters
 nadi paar karnaa kisi chunauti se kam nahin tha
 The people of the village were tired of telling their grief to the mlas and mps, but no one improved
 lihaaja maine nirnay liya ki ab yah kaam mujhe hi karnaa hoga
 "javed Ansari, former MLA of Jaunpur city, says," The people of Bhadethi had brought their demands to me and i also promised to do my best
 ”beson nadi par pehla pul javed ke dada haji shamsuddin ne 1996 main banwaaya tha
 Javed was 14 years old then
 30 lakh ru
 This bridge was also completed in 5-6 months
 apane dada ke is paroapkaar kaa javed ke dimag par kaaphi gaharaa asar hua
 At the same time, the construction work of the second bridge on this river had also started, but for some reason it remained incomplete
 phir javed ne use banavaane kaa jimmaa uthaaya or ab jaakar vah doosraa pul banakar taiyaar hua he
 Traffic has started on this
 yah pul bhadethi or bhado gaanvon ke alaava do jilon, jonpur or azamgarh ko bhi jodgaye kaa kaam karata he
 Its length is 40 meters
 javed kaa janm ek dhani parivaar main hua
 His grandfather Haji Shamsuddin was a big landowner
 unke pita mohammad jakariya or parivaar ke kaaphi sadsy ab singapore main rahete hai, jahaan unka family bijness he
 He owns 100 bigha of family land in Bhadetha
 javed khud bhi kaaphi samay tak singapore main rahe, lekin vahaan man na lagane ke kaaran waapas laut aae
 They get marriages done by the poor every year at their own expense and so far they have got 30 couples married
 saath hi unhone 20 garib logon kaa ghar bhi banwaaya he
 For Javed, these are minor things, but for the villagers, they are the form of God
 bhadethi ke mohammad rafiuddin kehete hai, ''main garib aadmi hum
 "I was worried about how to get my sister married
 lekin unhone shaadi ke liye do lakh ru
 Gave me a salvation
 ” apane nek kaamon se javed ne gaanvvaalon ke dil main apni khaas jagah bana lee he

 Wrestler Narsingh Yadav has been stuck in the case of doping for over 3 years, but he is still circling the court for justice
 yah maamla dilli hoicourt ne sibiai ko jaanch ke liye bhi de diya tha lekin 2 saal se upar hone ke baad bhi sibiai abhi apni jaanch puri nahin kar pai he
 The Delhi High Court has reprimanded the CBI for the continuous delay in completion of the investigation
 dilli hoicourt ne sibiai ko kaha he ki is maamle main vah apni states report daakhil karen or 20 agast ko court dobaaraa is par sunwaayee karegaa
 During the hearing in the court, the CBI lawyer said that investigation is still underway on Wrestler Narasimha Yadav
 lekin canada se jis scientist kaa bayaan lenaa he use abhi tak record nahin kiya gaya he
 So the investigation has not been completed yet
 sibiai ne court ko bataaya he ki scientist ko bayaan dene ke liye kai baar bulaayaa gaya
 Scientists have also been asked to give statements through the Canadian Embassy but they have not come yet
 is par narsingh yadav ke vakil ne aapatti jataate hue kaha ki ye narsingh ke saath ninsaphi he
 CBI is playing with the career of Narasimha Yadav
 narsingh ne naam lekar bataaya ki kisne unke khaane main milawat kii, lekin sibiai ne ab tak us vyakti se poochtacha tak nahin kar pai he
 In fact, Narasimha Yadav had filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, stating that he was implicated in doping charges to prevent him from playing in the Olympics
 is vajah se unhone sibiai se guzarish kii thi ki maamle main jaanch kare
 Even after completing three years, the CBI has not been able to do anything
 2020 march tak doping kii vajah se narsingh yadav ko association ne khilne se bain kiya hua he
 Narsingh Yadav was convicted in dope before going to the Rio Olympics in 2016, after which he was banned for 4 years by the National Anti Doping Agency (NADA)
 uske baad narsingh yadav ne sonipat ke rai police thane main shikaayat di thi ki unke saath sajeesh hui he
 In the complaint, the name of a boy was also given to the police on behalf of Narasimha but Narasimha alleges that the attitude of the police was sluggish and did not investigate
 maamla phir sibiai ko transfar kiya gaya, lekin desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency kii susti kaa shikaar ek baar phir narsingh yadav ko hona pad rahaa he
