 More than this, Prime Minister Modi's image of a working and free leader from corruption charges and unmatched ability to speak to the voters played an even greater role

 Among the most important works done by the Modi government, assuring the final person access to the schemes is key

 In contrast to Narendra modi-amit Shah's powerful and campaigning work, the Congress's slogans like 'ab Hoga Nyaya' and 'chowkidar Chor Hai' proved dull and ineffective

 Modi and Shah coined the term 'mahamilavat' for Bihar, mocking the grand alliance and Uttar Pradesh alliance; Through 'strong government versus forced government', an attempt was made to show how the government of the leaders of the opposition parties would collapse under the burden of their own contradictions and ambitions and caste politics is destroying this country in the long run

 party ke padaadhikariyon ko booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ke madhyam se matadaataaon or party ke sambhavit sadasyon ke bare main data ekatra karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 Later, a list of beneficiaries of the Modi government's schemes was sent to each booth and the booth workers were asked to reach out to them and call them using the information, so that they could be firmly linked with the party
 shah ne ek aisa system taiyaar kiya jisase sarkari yojanaon ke nae labhaarthiyon ke naam or pate 11 ashok road ke party ke puraane mukhyalay main bane party ke communication centre main saptaah main do baar pahunch jaaya karen
 On some occasions, the names of the beneficiaries were delivered daily and from there to the state and booth units in the shortest possible time
 23-sutri agenda ko nirdhaarit karne ke baad, shah ne ek or chaturipurn intjaam kiya
 He identified 25 senior, active and committed party leaders including Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar, JP Nadda and Arjun Ram Meghwal as well as Assam's Super Active Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma
 prayek ko un 125 siton main se chaar se chah kii jimmedaari di gai jahaan 2014 main bhaajapa haar gai thi
 These seats were brief to ensure the implementation of the 23-point agenda at the booth level
 in netaaon ne un nirvachan kshetron kaa kam se kam teen baar daura kiya jisaki jimmedaari unhen saunpi gai thi
 Sarma was handed the lost seats in the Northeast, Odisha to Meghwal and Javadekar and Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh Minister Mahendra Singh, known for his efficiency
 javdekar kehete hai, ''yah ek bhavy ranneeti thi jise keval ek doordarshee ranneetikaar hi soch or karyanvit kar saktaa tha
 "the best thing about Amitji's strategy was on strengthening support at the grassroots level," says Meghwal
 adhikansh chunavi ranneetikaar sheersh str par hi sakriyata dikhaate hai
 Amit Bhai kept an eye on both the top and bottom levels
 '' uttar pradesh bhaajapa ke sanghathan sachiv sunil bansal, bhaajapa mahasachiv or pashchim bengal ke prabharee mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey, party mahasachiv ram madhav or hemanta biswa sarama ne apane-apane nirdhaarit kshetron main chunavi talmail ke saath votaron kii lamabandi main shandaar bhoomika nibhaai
 Apart from this, Shah did a good job in addressing the concerns of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by taking excellent support in the grand election campaign
 pehle, unhone un ummidavaaron ko tikat diya jo samarpit aresas cader se aate hai
 He then continued on his original Hindutva agenda, even fielding Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur as a candidate from Bhopal
 haalanki, vipaksh ne isaki kadi aalochana kii lekin aresas kii baachhen khil gayi
 Then, in the two months before the announcement of election dates, party general secretaries Bhupendra Yadav and Anil Jain did a brilliant job of implementing a series of public programs and the effect was seen as mobilizing voters
 isse maharashtra, uttar pradesh or haryana jaise rajyon main bhaajapa netritv ko madad mili or vahaan ke rajya netritv ko pehle ke rajnatik pariwaron ke bhai-bhatijawad, bhrashtachar or jati-aadhaarit raajnneeti ko prashray dene waalon se ulat eemaandaar netaaon ke rup main dekha gaya
 The transparency of the governments of Yogi Adityanath, Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar certainly played a big role in their states
 haryana iskaa ek bada udhaaharan he
 Apparently, even the Jats, who are a deciding factor in the election, voted for an honest leadership by rising above caste
 bhaajapa ke paas ab aise eemaandaar sthaneey netritv ko viksit karne kaa avasar hoga
 Future Plans Humility and gratitude are two qualities that have been missing from BJP workers since 2014, whether it is in the speeches of their leaders or even the behavior of their lower-level leaders or activists
 party ke nichle str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sirf ek mashin samajha gaya or unke yogadan kaa shrey unhen kabhi nahin diya gaya
 Modi and Shah are so engrossed in strengthening the party and running the government that they have been unable to focus on these worrying aspects
 iske alaava, donon ne aksar soochna ke swatantra sroton ke bajaae chhanakar aane vaali jaankariyon par bharosa kiya he, jo unke aasapaas ke logon ke marfat milti rahi hai
 Having won a resounding victory, Modi and Shah must now ensure that the party is identified with humility rather than arrogance and gratitude to everyone, whether they are party workers or NDA allies

 Because Salman's recently released film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', which has been doing box office collections continuously at the box office, has suddenly dropped significantly
 film ne jahaan is hafte ravivaar ko 24
 While earning an amount of Rs
 05 crore, this film was only 9 on Tuesday
 30 karod kii kamai par hi simat gai
 The reason for this fall at the box office could be Yayakub Memonwala issue because earlier the film was setting a new record every day
 haalanki salmaan ne apane pita saleem khan ke kehane par apane twit ke liye maafee bhi maang lee thi
 Significantly, on Sunday, Salman had tweeted one after the other about the hanging sentence of Nayakub Memonki
 salmaan ne likhaa tha, 'tiger memon ko pakado, jo billi kii tarah chupa he or ham ek billi ko nahin pakad paa rahe
 
 
 '
 apane twit main salmaan ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif se bhi guzarish kii thi ki tiger agar pakistan main he, to bharat ko bataaen
 Salman also wrote that he wanted to tweet this for the last three days, but was silent because of fear
 baad mensalmaan khaanne apane is twit ke liye maafee maangane ke saath safai dete hue bhi twit kiya, unhone kaha, 'maine kabhi nahin kaha ki yaqub nirdosh he
 There are hundreds of deaths in Mumbai blast which is sad
 ' jo log mere twit ko dharm virdohi bataa rahe hai vah galat hai
 i respect all religions, i apologize unconditionally if any of my feelings are hurt
 i have not said or implied that Yakub Memon is innocent
 i have complete faith in the judicial system of our country

 haalanki wo dabi jubaan se yahi kah rahe hai ki pariksha khatm hone ke baad chaatro ne skool aana band kar diya tha
 Due to which the mid-day meal was not being made
 lihaaja maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue sarpanchon or gram pradhanon ne gas or chulhaa apane-apane gharon main le gaye
 In order to make mid-day meal in 696 government primary schools in Bemetara district, the state government gave the schools a gas stove with free gas cylinders
 isse kuch dinon tak to gas silendar or chuulhe se mid-de mile banane kaa kaam chalaa
 The children also breathed a sigh of relief as neither smoke came out of the kitchen of the school nor did they have to waste their time to collect wood and condens
 lekin ab chaatro or shikshakon kaa samay chulhaa jalaane or lakdi ikattha karne main biit rahaa he
 According to the information, for gas cylinders, the government had made a provision to provide fuel expenditure of twenty paisa per student per day in primary schools
 taaki silendar kaa gas khatm hone par usame gas bharwane main kisi tarah kii pareshaani naa ho
 In most schools, mid-day meals are conducted through sarpanches
 silendar main gas dalwane ke liye sthaan nirdhaarit or rakrakhaav kii jimmedaari bhi sarpanchon ko hi saunpi gai thi
 But only the sarpanches cleaned their hands on the gas cylinders

 Though there may have been a break on the rain in Delhi, the verbal war between the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi government and bjp's MCD is still going on due to the water logging caused by the rain
 jab jimmedaari kaa sawaal aata he to donon partiyaan ek duusare par keechad oochaalnaa shuru kar detii hai
 The latest case is of that list of traffic police, in which it has made a list of 370 such places, where water fills in the rain
 ye water loging point pichley saal ke tajurbe or is saal hui barish ke baad trephic main aayi rukaawat ke baad pahachaane gaye hai
 The traffic police has sent this list to the MCD as well as the PWD of Delhi Government
 trephic police in sadakon par pani nikasi ke intjaam kii bhi maang kii he
 After this list, the Delhi government and the MCD are face to face once again on the question of responsibility
 emsidi ne puri tarah se in water loging point ko dilli sarkaar kii laaparvaahee kaa nateeja bataaya he
 The MCD has stated that most of the points included in the list fall under the jurisdiction of PWD
 isiilie isaki jimmedaari bhi peedblyoody kii banati he
 According to Jayaprakash, vice president of Delhi BJP and councilor in North MCD, the roads of the MCD are in the streets and only small drains come under its purview, but the major drains of the Delhi government's PWD have not been cleaned
 khud sarkaar vidhansabha ke vishesh satr main ye maan chuki he ki peedblyoody ne naale saaf karne main laaparvaahee kii he
 In such a situation, if the water stops due to the waterlogging, then the Delhi government should come forward and take responsibility for it, not to throw mud on the MCD
 maharashtra ke nasik main buudhvaar subah ladaaku vimaan sukhoi-30 MKI krash kar gaya
 Both pilots aboard the aircraft are safe
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye fiter plane abhi test par tha jis dauraan ye krash ho gaya
 The aircraft was currently under production at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)
 ye vimaan nasik ke paas ek khet main vimaan krash hua
 After the accident, a crowd of villagers gathered near the wreckage of the plane
 abhi yah nahin saaf ho paaya he ki sukhoi ke krash hone ke peeche kya vajah he
 Just a few days ago, a mig-17 helicopter crashed in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand
 helicopter main construction kaa saamaan bharaa tha
 All the riders are safe but the helicopter was badly damaged
 ye helicopter guptkashi se kedarnath ke liye ravaanaa hua tha
 Significantly, the Sukhoi Su-30 is a Russian-built, two-engine military aircraft successfully used in all-weather military missions
 samarthan mulya main record badhotaree, kisaanon kii karj maafee, kheti kii dher sari scimen! phir bhi teen maheene main duusari baar kisaan dilli main aa jute
 In the recent elections, there has been a lot of sweat in the villages due to heavy turnout and sweat
 gujarat ke gaanvon kaa gussa chunavi nazeer ke taur par pesh hone laga
 If the opposition of the farmers is in the hand of the lumber, then why is it going on fire so fast again and again? rajyon ke nizaam bhi narebaaji ke bich kheti ko lekar upayon kaa sira kho baithe hai
 Governments are unable to see beyond the support price
 laagat se 50 fisadi zyada samarthan mulya samaadhaan hota to kisaan rah-rahakar sadakon par nahin hote
 This year, the world grain prices are lower than India
 rus or argentina main record utpaadan ke saath rabi mausam main bharat main bhi record utpaadan hua
 Since last September, the government has increased the import duty on wheat from 10 to 30 per cent, on palm oil 25 to 40 per cent, on soybean 25 to 35 per cent, on gram 25 to 50 per cent and on sugar 40 to 50 per cent
 The prices of all these crops are very low in the market
 aaayaatit anaaj, samarthan mulya se sasta he isliye kisaan ko bazaar main anaaj kii vah keemat koi nahin de rahaa, jo sarkaar detii he
 Of course, the government sitting on a huge grain stock cannot even buy whole grains
 pichley ek dashak main kheti takneekon main sudhaar ke baad anaaj kaa puraa global kaarobaar badal chukaa he
 The politics of support price is spoiling the agricultural market
 kisaan bhi ab yah jaan rahaa he ki anaaj use keval sarkaar ko bechnaa he isliye sankat kahin duusari jagah he
 The basic arithmetic of Indian farming has changed due to limited options in the market of cereals, sugarcane, pulses and oilseeds, the impact of imports, once a year earnings and small holdings
 pichley paanch-chah saal main kisaan teji se fal-sabji or doodh kii taraf mude hai jo unhen dainik nakadi uplabdh karaate hai
 The increase in production of milk and fruits and vegetables is four to eight times higher than that of cereals
 chote majhole kisaanon kii kamai main inkaa hissaa 20 se 30 fisadi he
 The crisis of farming is now the production of fruits and vegetables and milk
 fal-sabji kaa thok mulya suchakank pichley teen saal se jahaan kaa tahaan sthir he
 The same happened before the 2003-04 election
 pyaaj, aalu, doodh, anaar, lahasun, falon kii baari paidaavaar or sahi keemten na milane kaa sankat ab har saal aata he
 Consumers may have to pay higher prices for agricultural products, but wholesale prices have not increased for farmers
 sarkaar jahaan samarthan mulya de rahi he vahaan bazaar kisaan ke mafik nahin he or jo vah uga rahaa he vahaan sarkaar kaa koi dakhal nahin he
 There is no facility for storage of raw crops and political-minded traders and cartels of cooperative dairy (milk) are robbing the farmer as well as the consumer
 bharat main kheti kii nitiyaan killat dur karne par kendrit hai, jarurat se adhik paidaavaar sanbhaalane par nahin
 Shortages can be met by imports, but there is no way to sell more produce
 1933 main america main mandi ke baad raashtrapati roosevelt ne agri edjastment act ke tahat kuch fasalon ke atirikt paidaavaar ghataane ke liye protsaahan die the jabaki kuch nai fasalon kii taraf modaa tha
 But Indian politics has no time to think anything new
 uttar pradesh or maharashtra kii naseehaton ke baad agar bhaajapa ne, taaja chunaavon main, kisaan karj maafee ke vaade se kinaaraa kiya to congress use le udi
 The rate of increase in wages in villages is at the lowest level of three months
 2018-19 ke bich gaanvon main isamen 60 fisadi kii kami kii ashanka he
 Also, almost all crops are in the grip of recession
 lekin bhartiya raajnneeti kheti ko jo dawa de rahi he usase kheti kaa bhala to dur, siyasat kaa bhi bhala nahin ho rahaa he
 History shows that if the villages get angry, governments panic
 chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav vastutah gaanvon ke chunaav hai
 From these results, we will know what has changed in the relationship between politics and rural economy after 2014

 After cutting the cake, there was a firework like never seen in the skies of Rampur, but when a journalist asked Kautuhal where the money came from for this arrangement, Khan Sahab was enraged
 unhone kaha ki talibani fund he, taliban ne diya he
 Some have been given by Dawood, given by Abu Salem and the rest by those who died terrorists
 ajam khan kii yah jubaan governor sahab ko nagavar gujri, ve chaahate hai ki unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 He said that Azam ji is an important minister of the state

 i will not say anything more than this to me
 mukhyamantri kaa katarvy he ki jo unhone kiya he, usamen dakhal dekar uchit karrwai karen
 Whatever the Governor may say, but Azam Khan believes that once poor people like him celebrated in Rampur, then people are burnt like dead in the crematorium

 Now a similar case has been seen in West Bengal, where the relatives of the deceased accused, who have filed a petition in the Calcutta High Court, have appealed to the court to order Yamraj to come back from Yamlok alive on this earth to pay the punishment to the culprits
 Send yachikakarta yaheen nahin rukaa, usne hoicourt se yah bhi apil kii he ki agar yamraj aisa nahin karte hai, to unke khilaaf court avmaananaa kii kaarywahi kii jaae
 In fact, Samar Chaudhary and his two sons Ishwar and Pradeep assaulted someone in Garulia in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal in 1984
 is marpet main ek vyakti kii maut ho gai thi
 After this, on February 9, 1987, the Additional Sessions Court of Alipur in the case sentenced all the accused to five years in jail
 iske baad march 1987 main aropiyon ne nichali adaalat ke faisle ko kalakatta hoicourt main chunauti di thi
 After this, the High Court issued an interim order and stayed his sentence
 iske baad hoicourt main maamle kii sunwaayee shuru hone se pehle pradeep or samar kii maut ho gai
 Pradeep died on 17 February 1993 and Samar died on 16 September 2010

 Therefore, the family of the accused could not tell the High Court that the accused are no longer in this world due to not being the advocate for the case
 iske baad hoicourt ne maamle main aropiyon ke liye emicas curi niyukt kar diya
 The court then pronounced the judgment, dismissing the appeal on 16 June 2016 and upheld the lower court's decision
 iske baad yachikakarta ne aropiyon kii maut kii jaankaree nahin dene ke liye adaalat main maafinama diya

 One of Bollywood's most talked about starkids, Taimur, son of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan, has become a favorite of social media and paparazzi (photographers photographing celebrities)
 taimur na sirf apni maasoom or natkhat harkaton ke chalate photographers kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchate hai balki jab photographers unhen aawaaj dete hai to vah unhen atension, or kai baar jawaab bhi dete hai
 Recently a new video of him has gone viral on social media
 video main taimur apni mummy karina ke saath gaadi se utarate hai or photographers ke camera se chamakate flash ko dekhakar bhadak jate hai
 Taimur is seen angrily lashing out at the photographers in his parrot and trying to scold them
 karina jab unase chalane ke liye kahati hai to vah koi riection nahin dete or jab karina taimur kaa haath pakadaney kii koshish karti hai to vah unka haath jhatak dete hai
 Seeing the photographers' voice and flashing flash, Timur shouts loudly- NO
 haalanki photographers ko taimur kaa ye gussa bhi itnaa kute lagata he ki wo use aawaaj dena jari rakhte hai
 During this time they go far ahead and enter the airport gate
 karina kapur khan kaa betaa taimur uske janm ke kuch vakt baad kaaphi charchaa main aa gaya tha
 Actually, when Saif named him Timur, people started opposing it

 ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle se congress ko ummid he ki 2004 kaa yah maamla gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii 7 rescorse road kii daud kii badi baadha ban jayega
 These speculations were bolstered when the CBI allowed the bail of four Gujarat police officers allegedly involved in the encounter
 in adhikariyon main gujarat ke ipies adhikari ji
 L
 singhl bhi shaamil hai jinaki jamaanat unhen sarkari gavaah banane ke iraade se karwaai gai he
 He also called Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Rajendra Kumar for questioning
 rajendra kumaar ne gujarat police ko yah soochna di thi ki ishrat or do pakistaniyon sahit teen anya log modi, laalkrishna adwani or vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) netaa praveen togdipha kii kathith taur par hatya karne ke liye gujarat pahunchane vaale hai
 On June 14, a leading news channel claimed, quoting CBI sources, that Singhal had become a government witness and had also recorded his statement before the magistrate under Section 164 of the Indian Penal Code
 is bayaan ke teen mukhya bindu hai:-ibi ke rajendra kumaar ne muthbhed ke pehle or baad siem offis se 37 baar baat kii thi
 - The four people, including Ishrat's partner Pranesh Pillai alias Javed Sheikh, were taken from the gujarat-maharashtra border to Ahmedabad and deliberately killed them after questioning them
 uske baad unki laashon ko ahmedabad ke bahari ilaake main ek jagah par aise laga diya ki muthbhed vaastavik lage
 Arms recovered from the so-called terrorists were arranged by Rajendra Kumar
 yah bayaan agar sach he to anya saakshyon dwaara pramanit hone par sibiai iskaa istemaal modi or unke vishwaasapaatr, gujarat ke tatkaaleen grih mantri evam philhal uttar pradesh ke prabharee bijepi mahasachiv amit shah ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar karne ke liye kar sakati he
 Ishrat's death is being politicized to present a picture of Muslim oppression before the general election
 modi kii muslim virdohi chhavi banane ke liye congress or rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke netaa mumbai ke guru nanak dev college kii chaatra 19 varshiya ishrat ko nirdosh ke taur par pesh kar rahe hai
 However, this strategy of the Congress and NCP suffered a major setback last week when IB director Asif Ibrahim presented concrete evidence before the CBI, the Prime Minister's Office and the Union Home Ministry that the four Pakistanis — including Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar — killed Modi Were part of a module of lashkar-e-taiba formed with the intention of
 soochna ke mutabik, ibrahim ne kaha ki rajendra kumaar sidhe-saadhe vyakti hai or unhen sajaa hone par bharat kii pramukh gharelu guptchar agency ko tagada jhatka lagegaa
 The evidence he presented included a tape of a Lashkar terrorist's conversation with Sheikh proving the four of them were on a terrorist mission, and the testimony given by the FBI to David Headley, the 2008 Mumbai terror attack accused, that Ishrat Was a member of Lashkar india today samooh ke samachar channel ajtak tathaa hedlins today ne lashkar aatanki tathaa shaikh kii tepe kii hui baatcheet ko sabase pehle prasaarit kiya
 Significantly, one of the key officials related to the case, the then Joint Commissioner of Police of Ahmedabad Crime Branch and currently the Additional Director General of Gujarat P

 Pandey went underground in May to evade arrest warrants
 sibiai ne adaalat se unhen faraar ghoshit karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Pandey is accused of being one of the chief officers involved in this alleged fake encounter
 is maamle main sibiai kaa pravesh tab hua jab ishrat or shaikh ke rishtedaaron ne muthbhed ko farji bataate hue gujarat hycourt main yachika daayar kii or kaha ki unka pakistan ke aatanki sanghathan lashkar se koi sambandh nahin tha
 Interestingly, on the day of the encounter, the Lashkar mouthpiece Gajwa Times in Lahore called Ishrat a member of Lashkar and described him as a 'martyr for Islam'
 baharhaal 2007 main shaikh ke pita dwaara sibiai jaanch kii maang ko lekar adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhatane ke kuch din pehle lashkar ke mul sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa ne pehle ke bayaan ko waapas lete hue daawa kiya ki ishrat lashkar kii sadsy nahin thi
 In this new statement, the earlier claim was apologized to Ishrat's family for the difficulties posed by the organization, terming it as a mistake
 lashkar se sambandhit maamle ke ghatnakram or yachika kaa daayar kiya janaa is baat kaa sanket he ki aatanki sanghathan lashkare-tayba ke is you-turn kaa uddeshy bharat main adaalat ko gumraah or ibi ko badnaam karnaa tha
 Ibrahim's stand on the issue has created a disgraceful situation in front of the Congress at a time when Modi is on a campaign to unite his party with the UPA
 bijepi sibiai ke peeche congress ke 'haath’ ko benakaab karne kii ummid kar rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman says, "now the fact has been revealed to the public that the Congress can also circumvent national security for the sake of votes
" modi par abhiyog daayar karne ke kisi bhi prayaas kaa ulataa asar hoga
 "congress spokesperson Tehseen Poonawalla dismisses bjp's charge, saying," Such killings done on purpose cannot be justified
 yadi ve aatankwaadi the to unke khilaaf kanoon ke anusaar karrwai kii jaani chahie thi
 "if the CBI actually files a charge sheet accusing Modi of forging an encounter, then this case can take a serious turn
 magar congress ko na keval patibaddh hindu voton par padane vaale sambhavit asar kaa dhyaan rakhana padegaa balki aatankwaad ke mudde par kisi bhi tarah ke samjhaute ke virdohi udaar hindu voton par padane vaale asar kaa bhi akalan karnaa hoga
 At the same time, an allegation would be an embarrassment for Modi at a time when he would like to keep his image absolutely clear
 iskaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki bijepi iskaa istemaal unhen ek aise majboot vyakti ke rup main pesh karne ke liye kar sakati he jo aatankwaad se do-do haath karne ke liye qamar kasakar taiyaar he

 The traditional thinking is that in its first term UPA successfully ran the government, so it got a better mandate to run the government again
 duusari pari main usne ahankaar, bhrashtachar, atmamugdhata or aalasy ke chalate pehali pari main bani acchhee chhavi ko matiamet kar daalaa
 As a result of this, UPA-2 is constantly facing one crisis after another
 duusari pari main upie ke pradarshan kaa bachaav karnaa vastav main mushkil he
 But we should re-evaluate the softness of the first innings
 aaj sarkaar jo bhi dikkatein jhel rahi he, adhiktar kii jaden uske pehle kaarykaal se judi hai
 In its first innings, the UPA made three particularly important mistakes
 pehali galati aarthik sudhaaron kii paribhaasha ko behad sankara rakhane kii thi
 Manmohan Singh recognized that reforms meant taking India closer to the West and making foreign investment standards flexible
 pehali pari main in uddeshyon kaa kuch arth nikal saktaa tha lekin upie sarkaar chunki vam dalon ke samarthan par tiki thi isliye inhen naakaam rahanaa hi tha
 That is why when the Prime Minister could not pass this agenda, he thought it better to forget the reforms more or less
 inke alaava bhi bharat ko kuch gaiyr-aarthik sudhaaron kii bhi sakht jarurat thi or inhen harek dal se samarthan milanaa hi tha
 We all agree that neither is trend correctly, nor is their number sufficient
 jin sudhaaron kii jarurat thi unhen ek ke baad ek police ayog kii rapaton main ginvaaya ja chukaa he
 The UPA had to implement these recommendations
 yah baat bhi sabko maaloom he ki hamaare yahaan aparaadhiyon ko kanoon kaa dar isliye nahin rahata kyonki hamaari nyaay vyavastha charmara rahi he
 It takes years to come to the trial stage and the criminals take bail and revisit the crime
 aakhirkaar sunwaayee hoti bhi he tab tak jaanch adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa ho chukaa hota he, saboot nasht kar die gaye hote hai or gavaahon ko daraaya-dhamkaaya ja chukaa hota he
 The solution to this crisis appears to be very clear: make more courts and appoint more judges
 iske baavjood upie ne is disha main kuch nahin kiya he
 Today, when rapists are roaming freely hunting children and women and the public is as scared of the police as criminals, India is paying the price of the UPA government's failure to implement the necessary reforms
 
 jo pradarshnkaree sadakon par naare laga rahe hai, ve darasal aam aadmi ke moulik adhikaar kii hi to maang kar rahe hanru suraksha kaa adhikaar
 For an ordinary Indian, shopping is more important than a chance to shop at Walmart
 upie kii duusari galati rashtriya sansadhano ke aavanton se najar pher lenaa tha jo uski pahunch ke bheetar tha
 Everyone knew that DMK was making billions from telecom licenses
 upie ke shuruaati dinon main koyala ghotaale ke bare main har koi jaanata tha
 The government should have adopted a transparent process of auction and allotment which would make it difficult for the leaders to break the system to make their profits
 iske liye pashchimi deshon main vaishvik maanak lagu hote hai jinhen aasaani se apanaaya ja saktaa tha
 Had the government done this, some scams that happened in UPA-1 and are shaking UPA-2 today, could have been avoided
 sawaal yah he ki upie ne prakriya ko paardarshee kyon nahin banaaya? isliye kyonki vah apane saathiyon ko kamaane kaa mauka dene ke adhikaar ko apane haath se aise hi nahin jane dena chahta tha or yah maanata tha ki diemke jaise saajheedaaron ko unki vafadari ke badale kamaane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 His third mistake has proved to be the most dangerous for the government
 upie ke raaj vaale pichley nau saal ke dauraan madhyavarg ke ubhaar ne desh ko badal daalaa he
 Gone are the days when leaders survived murders
 madhyavarg ab itnaa jaagruk ho gaya he ki har cheez jaanch ke daayre main aa gai he or janata kaa aakrosh kahin zyada raudra rup lene laga he
 Even today, there are roughly as many newspapers and TV channels as there were in the first innings of the UPA, but the way the media has changed towards politicians was always unthinkable
 ab puraane jamaane vaali maryaadaayen nahin raheen, javabdehi kii maang badi he or soshal media ke akraman ne mukhyadhara ke media ko or zyada aakraamak banane par majaboor kiya he
 Ironically, it was Manmohan Singh's economic policies of 1991 that have directly worked to create such a strong middle class
 baavjood iske na to manmohan singh or na hi unki party ne is baat ko samajha ki bharat kitni teji se badal rahaa he yaa in badlaavon ke anukool banane ke liye netaaon ko kya karnaa hoga
 Today, when they are struggling to make a move with this new India, it seems that they are a group of clumsy people who are trying to force the thorns of the clock backward

 bhopal kaa loksabhaa chunaav aakhri baar 1991 main ek khaas vajah se surkhiyon main tha
 That was the main reason that Congress fielded former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi aka Tiger Pataudi
 unhen tab bhaajapa ke es
 C
 verma ke haathon karaari shikast mili thi
 For Pataudi, the defeat was even more bitter as he suffered a defeat in Bhopal where he was once ruled by his younger people
 bhopal main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar kitna majboot he, ise isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki pichley 30 varshon main party ne lagaataar aath baar is seat par kabja jamaaya he, haalanki uske ummidavaar lagaataar badalte rahe hai
 Now come to 2019
 is baar bhi bhopal kii siyaasi ladaai rashtriya surkhiyaan bator rahi he
 The reason for this is the candidates of both the rival parties from this seat
 congress ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke khilaaf bhaajapa ne maalegaanv dhamaakon kii aaropee pragna singh thakur ko maidan main utaara he
 Obviously, the competition is strong and due to this, everyone's eyes will be set on Bhopal
 ek taraf satta kaa lanbaa anubhav rakhane vaale purv mukhyamantri hai, lekin lambey samay se apane upar ho rahe lagaataar rajnatik hamalon ke kaaran unki rajnatik jameen kuch khiski he
 The BJP leaders of the state have already promoted him as a divisive and anti-development campaigner of Madhya Pradesh
 rahi-sahi kasar bhaajapa kii trol fouj ne soshal media par unki chhavi hinduon ke sabase bade shatru congressi netaa ke taur par banaakar puri kar di he
 Digvijay Singh has tried to change his anti-hindu image through his 3,300-km Narmada Parikrama Yatra, as well as his political rejuvenation after the Congress returned to power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years
 congress ko sattashin karne main ek pramukh ranneetikaar ke rup main unki bhi bhoomika thi
 Party insiders say that Digvijay did not want to contest from Bhopal but his friend and Chief Minister Kamal Nath forced him to contest from Bhopal itself
 baharhaal, ve joardaar ladaai se kabhi peeche nahin hate hai isliye raji ho gaye
 On the other side is Pragya Singh Thakur
 bhind main janmi is sadhvi kaa naam 2008 ke maalegaanv dhamaake main aaropee ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Six people were killed in the blast
 pragna, dakshinpanthi dal ke liye har lihaaj se mufeed hai
 She was a member of Durga Vahini and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in her early days and recently claimed that she had climbed over the dome to demolish the Babri Masjid
 pragna ko april, 2017 main jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya tha lekin gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyaan rokthaam adhinium (yuapie) ke tahat ve ab bhi ek abhiyukt hai kyonki rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ke unhen bari karne ke anurodh ke baavjood adaalat ne unhen aropamukt nahin kiya he
 Bhopal is considered a safe seat for the BJP and the party has no shortage of candidates, yet why did the party field Pragya Thakur from Bhopal? Party insiders say that from the day the Congress announced Digvijay Singh's candidature, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is clearly playing a role in the selection of candidates this time, and party president Amit Shah , Both were making up their mind to field Pragya Thakur against Digvijay this time
 netritv ke ek varg kaa maananaa tha ki congress ke purv mukhyamantri ke khilaaf pragna thakur ko utaarne ke peeche ek sandesh yah bhi dena he ki congress ne is seat se ek ‘hindu virdohi’ netaa ko utaara isliye bhaajapa ne pratikriyaswaroop ek kattar hinduvadi chehre ko mauka diya he
 This approach was intensely discussed within the BJP as many leaders were unwilling to do so for several reasons
 saath hi, bhaajapa netaaon ke ek varg ko laga ki beshak bhopal main bhaajapa majboot rahi he, phir bhi digvijay singh kii ummidavaari ko halke main nahin liya janaa chahie
 Finally, after nearly a month of deliberations and the refusal of top BJP leaders like Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Uma Bharti to contest from Bhopal, the party announced Pragya Thakur's candidature
 pragna thakur ko maidan main utaarne ko lekar bhaajapa kii chintaaen kya hai? bhaajapa ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki pragna thakur ko maidan main utaarne se party ke shahari vot ke ek hisse ke khisak jane kaa jokhim khadaa ho gaya he
 Says a BJP MLA, "people who vote for BJP in the name of development have raised questions about the choice of BJP candidate
 ve log congress ko bhi vot nahin de sakate
 In such a situation, they will either not go to vote or choose NOTA
 ’’ pragna thakur ke paas sanghathanaatmak anubhav kaa bhi abhaav he, shahar ke bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke saath unka sampark bhi bahut kam rahaa he or apane paksh main matadaataaon ko lamaband karne ke liye ve aresas par bahut adhik nirbhar hai
 Within a week of announcing his candidature, Pragya Thakur made an objectionable statement about Ashok Chakra award winning IPS officer late Hemant Karkare for polarizing voters
 unhone kaha ki unke shaap ke kaaran karkare ne ek aatanki ke haathon jaan ganvaai
 His statement created an uproar and the party which used the agenda of nationalism vigorously came on the backfoot
 lekin pragna thakur itane par nahin sanbhaleen
 She claimed the day after the statement that she was also involved in the Babri Masjid demolition
 bhaajapa lipapoti karne main jute gai or ab ek anbhavi pravaktaa kii du tii puri tarah unke saath lagaai gai he
 On 21 April, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan also held a lengthy conversation with him, explaining to him the intricacies associated with contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 ek hafte ke baad bhi, team pragna thakur ke paas bataane ke liye bhopal ke vikaas kaa apana koi agenda yaa dastavej nahin hai
 Obviously, this is not in his top priority
 haalanki party netritv kaa ek varg aisa he jo maanata he ki pragna thakur nirvachan kshetra ke gramin ilaakon main hindu voton kaa bhaajapa ke paksh main dhruvikaran karaayengi
 Originally, people for whom religion is the biggest factor while casting votes, there is a greater enthusiasm among the voters of both urban and rural areas than the candidature of Pragya Thakur
 bhopal loksabhaa ke antargat sihor, barasiyaa or hujur vidhansabha kshetron kaa gramin vot, bhopal ke kul 21 lakh voton kaa lagbhag 30 pratishat he
 He told party workers in Bhopal on Saturday, "modi ji has given this message that there is a need to give respect to saffron
" yah keval chunaav nahin balki ek dharmayuddh he
 Pragya Thakur filed his nomination from Bhopal on 23 April and ten minutes after that, the current MP Alok Sanjar filed his nomination as the party's dummy candidate
 ise party kaa byaap plan bataaya ja rahaa he
 Reason: The Election Commission has given two notices to Pragya Thakur and an FIR has been lodged against him for violation of Election Code of Conduct
 isaki vajah se unki ummidavaari andeh ke daayre main aa gai he
 On the other hand, the NIA court rejected the plea to stop Pragya Thakur from contesting the election
 mote taur par pragna thakur kii ranneeti muslim voton ke dhruvikaran kaa muqabla karne ke liye hindu voton ke dhruvikaran kii lagati he
 The BJP hoped that this would happen with the arrival of Digvijay Singh as the Congress candidate
 yah dekhte hue ki unke pratyaashee ke paas vikaas kaa koi khaakaa nahin he, bhaajapa netaa khud ko vikaas ke naam par vot maangane kii sthiti main nahin paa rahe
 This is becoming ironic for BJP
 bhaajapa kaa aisa pratyaashee jiskaa saarvajanik jivan kaa anubhav hota or jo kam kattarpanthi prishthbhumi vaala hota, vah digvijay singh ke khilaaf bhaajapa ke donon hathiyaaron kaa bharpoor istemaal kar paata
 Firstly, the anti-development image of the BJP that Digvijay Singh has created in 15 years, as well as the latest image of Digvijay as a person who is anti-hindu and unrestrained
 ye donon baaten is ladaai kaa palada bhaajapa kii ore jhukaane ke liye paryaapt hotin
 Uma Bharti, while leading the attack against Digvijay Singh in 2003, termed him as a failure to solve basic development issues like electricity, roads and water
 logon ko yah baat jam gai or bhaajapa ko abhootpurv janadesh mila lekin vidambnaa yah he ki congress ab vikaas kii baat kar rahi he jabaki bhaajapa dharm kii bhashaa bolti he
 What is Digvijay Singh's strategy in these changed circumstances? The former Chief Minister has returned to the electoral arena after a long gap of nearly 19 years
 pehali cheez to ve pragna thakur kii ore se uthaae gaye kisi bhi mudde par koi pratikriya nahin de rahe hai or apane swabhaav ke vipareet maun hai
 He does not want to get involved in any chakravyuha of the opposition so he refused to comment on the statements made by Pragya Thakur on Karkare and Babri Masjid
 chunaav abhiyaan ke apane shuruaati dinon main unhone karmchaariyon se maafee maangi, jo shahar kaa ek bada vot bank rahaa he
 He released a fancy vision document for Bhopal on 21 April, presenting a power point presentation in which the local problems of the city are discussed
 is tarah ve yah jataane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jahaan tak vikaas ke agenda kaa sawaal he, ve bhaajapa se milon aage hai
 Team Digvijay Singh has been working behind the scenes with various social and economic groups, industrial organizations, students and communities, in which Digvijay Singh himself has met at least three dozen such groups
 unki prachaar team kaa hissaa rahe aruneshwar singhdev digvijay singh ke votaron ke saath vyaktigat taur par puraane judaav kii baat par jor dete hue kehete hai, ‘‘raajnneeti main koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he jisane akele itane adhik logon kii madad kii ho
 Digvijay also has enough religious affiliations to woo such voters who want him to be led by a Hindu leader
 digvijay ke adhikansh daure mandir kii yatraaon se shuru hote hai or 19 april ko hanuman janmotsav ke avasar par unhone ek darjan se adhik mandiron me darshan kiye, ek goshaala main gaayon ko chaara daalkar goseva kii
 However, he says in front of the media, "my Hinduism is my faith
 maine kabhi bhi apane dharmik kaaryon kaa prachaar nahin kiya he, chaahe vah narmada parikrama ho, govardhan parikrama ho yaa phir pangarpur yatra
 The Hindutva of the Sangh does not bring unity among the people, but divides it
 main rajnatik laabh ke liye apane dharm kaa haran kabhi nahin hone duungaa
 "the network of his old comrades has become active and a team of Digvijay Singh's school, Daily College, Indore is also camping in Bhopal for elections
" narmada parikrama main unke sahyatri rahe logon main se lagbhag 300 vyakti unke liye ghar-ghar jaakar prachaar bhi kar rahe hai
 The Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency consists of eight assembly constituencies, out of which the Congress is currently occupied by Bhopal south-west, Bhopal Central and Bhopal North, and the BJP with Berasia, Sehore, Huzur, Narela and Govindpura
 digvijay singh ke bhaajapa ke teen vidhayakon krishna gaur, vishwaas saarang or sudesh raay ke saath nijee sambandh bahut madhur hai or aisi sambhaavna he ki unhen apane nijee sambandhon kaa phayda milegaa
 Also, none of these were consulted or negotiated before deciding to field Pragya Thakur from Bhopal
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ke ye vidhayak pragna thakur ko lekar bahut utsahit nahin dikhte
 Around 4 in Bhopal
 5 lakh muslim matadaata hai or unka vot kisko jayega, iske akalan ke liye bahut dimag lagane kii jarurat nahin he
 In addition, about 1
 75 lakh anusuchit jati ke vot hai
 The Congress hopes that a large part of it will fall into its bag
 bhopal kaa chunaav kai lihaaj se charchaa kaa vishay he
 For BJP, the result of this seat will set its core agenda and provide opportunity for opponents to ponder whether the country now has a permanent inclination towards right
 bhopal ke logon ke liye is chunaav main haar-jeet kaa arth itnaa bhar he: puraane bhopal kii saajha samskruti jeetegi yaa phir nayaa bhopal jisamen saamudayik aadhaar par vibhaajan saaf dikhataa he?*** The US said on Friday that 'the way forward' for India to become a full member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is by the end of the year
 america ne yah baat sol main enesji kii ek purna baithak khatm hone ke kuch ghante baad kahi, jisamen china nit virodh ke maddenjar bharat kii sadsyta ke bare main koi nirnay nahin ho sakaa
 a top official of the Kamobama administration will have to do with India's membership, 'we are confident that we have a way forward by the end of this year
 ' adhikari ne apana naam gupt rakhane kii shart par kaha, 'iske liye kuch kaam karne kii jarurat he
 However, we are confident that by the end of the year, India (NSG) will be a full member of the system
 'america ko he puri ummidhikari ne 48 sadasyeey samooh ke bich bharat kii sadsyta ko lekar hui charchaaon evam virodh kii jaankaree kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar karte hue kaha ki aantarik charchaaon kii jaankaree gopneey he
 The official said that though the United States has a strong belief in India's membership of the NSG and the Obama administration has worked closely with India and other countries on the issue
 'emticiar main bhi charchaa ke baad hui thi bharat kii entriadhikari ne charchaaon kii jaankaree die bina prakshepastra praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha (emticiar) main hui isi tarah kii charchaa kaa ullekh kiya jisamen bharat ko uske sadsy deshon ke bich kai maheene kii charchaa ke baad is maheene ke shuru main shaamil kiya gaya tha

 The officer insisted, "we can finish the discussion this week and we have a way forward by the end of the year to become a full member of India
" ' yah puche jane par ki kya america ummid karata he ki bharat ko enesji kii sadsyta is saal ke aakhir tak hasil ho sakegi, varisht prashasnic adhikari ne doharaaya, 'yah hamaari ummid he
 "the official said," We hope that it will be completed by the end of this year
 ' enesji kii purna baithak sol main khatm hui jisamen bharat kii sadsyta ke bare main koi nirnay nahin kiya gaya
 China did not keep confidential its opposition to India's claim of membership of NSG in the membership of India

 samaajawaadee party ne ravivaar ko loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye star prachaarkon kii list jari kii, jisamen akhilesh yadav se lekar jila adhyaksh or purv vidhayakon ko tavajjo di gai
 But Mulayam Singh Yadav, who laid the foundation of the party, was absent
 ise lekar akhilesh yadav kii jamkar kirakiri hui
 Due to this, SP had to re-issue the list after seven hours, in which Mulayam has been named at the top
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki mulaayam kii bujurgiyat aade aa rahi thi yaa phir basapa kii dosti, jiske khatir unhen star prachaarak ke taur par sapa kii pehali fehrist main jagah nahin di gai thi?sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne 40 star prachaarkon kii suchi jari thi, jisamen akhilesh yadav, dimple yadav, tej pratap yadav or dharmendra yadav sahit 'yadav parivaar' ke kai sadsy shaamil the
 Not only this, even the smallest SP leader was given a place as a star campaigner, but Mulayam Singh, who took the foundation of the party from the floor to the hail, was not included
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki sapa mulaayam ko star prachaarak ke taur par shaamil na karne kii teen pramukh vajah rahi hai
 However, after being gritty, SP released a second list, in which Mulayam Singh was named first
 ise lekar sapa ke pravaktaa or netaaon ne koi bhi bayaan or pratikriya dene se parhez kiya, lekin sutron kaa maane to party ke sheersh netritv ne budhaape kaa hawala dete hue mulaayam ko star prachaarkon kii list main shaamil nahin kiya tha
 The SP was also spared that lest Mulayam Singh Yadav come out to campaign and say something that would harm the party instead of benefiting it
 haal ke dinon main akhilesh yadav jab hardik patel ke saath press conference kar rahe the, isi bich mulaayam singh pahunchakar sapa-basapa gathbandhan par sawaal karte hue akhilesh yadav kii alochana kii thi
 Not only this, he was also unhappy about the joint rally of BSP chief Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav in Mainpuri
 sutron kii maane to sapa isiilie bhi batch rahi thi ki pichley dinon sansad main jis tarah se mulaayam singh yadav ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif karte hue dobaaraa se piem banane ke liye shubhakamanaayen di thi, ise lekar akhilesh or mayawati naaraaz the
 In such a situation, Akhilesh did not want to get angry with Mayawati by including Mulayam
 vahiin, shivpal yadav ne akhilesh yadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue pita kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 In Firozabad, Shivpal said that it is very disappointing to hear that Netaji is being insulted and ignored
 jabaki sapa ne un logon kii suchi main shaamil kiya he jo apni vyaktigat kshamta main 10 vot nahin dilaa sakate hai
 Whereas i formed the party with the blessings of Netaji
 hamane mainpuri main netaji ke khilaaf ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 At the same time, UP CM Yogi Adityanath lashed out at Akhilesh, saying that it is very unfortunate that his son did not include Mulayam Singh's name in the list of campaigners
 jabaki mulaayam singh ne bhai ke saath milakar door-tu-door prachaar karke party ko khadaa kiya
 In such a situation, a person who cannot be loyal to his father can never serve the people

 Actually, now Anandpal's mother Nirmal Kanwar and daughter Yogita are campaigning against the BJP and are supporting the Congress
 bataa den ki anandapal singh ke maamle ko lekar rajput samaaj kii bijepi se khaas naaraazgi rahi he
 Ravana Rajput Samaj, opposing Anandpal's encounter, has opened a front against the government
 pehle khabaren aa rahi thim ki anandapal kii maa nirmal kanvar nagaur ke deedwanaa yaa ladnun se chunaav maidan main utar sakati hai
 Many Rajput organizations have been alleging that Anandpal could have been caught alive if the government wanted to, but in the event of this, many big faces were afraid of being exposed, so he was killed
 asal main anandapal kaa encounter ab vasundhara sarkaar ke liye musiibat ban gaya he
 Due to this encounter, Ravana Rajput society is already angry with the government
 loksabhaa ke upachunaavon main bhi hui bijepi kii haar main rajput samaaj kii ahm bhoomika maani ja rahi thi, kyonki ajmer loksabhaa kshetra main rawana rajput 65 hajaar kii sankhya main hai

 Whether Rajput has become Ravana Rajput, we are working together to defeat BJP
 hamen lag rahaa he ki bijepi rajputon ke khilaaf he
 However, now the case of Anandpal is in the hands of the CBI
 kya he anandapal kii kahani?pradesh ke shekhavati or marwar main aazaadee ke baad jat congress ke samarthak ban gaye the or rajput congress ke khilaaf bolne lage the
 At the same time, the Jats had spread their feet in politics and started playing an important place in politics in the state
 kuch saalon baad jaaton kii dabangai khatm karne or rajputon main apana prabhaav jamaane kii koshish hui
 During that time Anandpal Singh emerged as a criminal in Rajputs and Anandpal Singh killed Jat leader Jeevan Ram Godara in broad daylight

 haalanki anandapal singh raajnneeti main janaa chahta tha or saal 2000 main jila panchayat kaa chunaav jeeta
 He then contested as an Independent in Pradhan's election and lost by 2 votes
 uske baad vah raajnneeti main bhi anya netaaon kii najar main aa gaya
 Gradually, Anandpal Singh's gang smuggled large parts of Shekhawati and Marwar into liquor smuggling and illegal possession of land
 us par 5 lakh kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 There were more than 20 cases registered against him
 vahiin anandapal kaa siyaasi mohare ke rup main bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, Anandpal Singh openly helped Younus Khan win the election
 anandapal kii badaulat rajasthan sarkaar main mantri rahe younus khan ne vasundhara raaje ke virdohi netaaon par bhi niyantran paa liya tha
 Many leaders have alleged that Younis Khan also used to visit Anandpal who was in jail

 a spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited said the fire was quickly controlled and the passengers were safely evacuated
 dusron ko beraham maut denevaale aatankwaadiyon kii jab apni zindagi par aan padati he, to haalat kisi hoti he
 It is visible in Iraq these days
 kuch roj pehle aatankwaadiyon ke burka odh kar maidan e jang se bhaagane kii tasviren saamne ai thim
 It is now learned that the terrorists had built tunnels to avoid the soldiers and Kurdish fighters
 america or vietnami style main patharilii jameen par khodi gai in lambii surangon kaa istemaal aatankwaadi naa sirf mahfuj jagahon par bhaagane ke liye, balki chupane ke liye bhi kar rahe the
 Somewhere in a secluded place
 kahin kooday-kachare dheron ke bich, to kahin kisi khandhar ke paas
 ISISK militants have built tunnels in such places that the Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters who have been chasing the terrorists have also blown their senses
 iraqi fouj ko mili kai suranjpane iklaute or aakhri garh yani iraq chemosulashahar main iraqi or kurdish fiteron kii fouj ab jaise-jaise aage bad rahi he, vaise-vaise kadam-kadam par unhen iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke banaae hue surang mil rahe hai
 These tunnels not only have traces of ISIS militants escaping but also hiding here for a long time, but before you tell the full story of this tunnel of these tunnels around the Iraqi city of Mosul
 sunrag main khaane-pine kii chijen or bistar bhi maujuudapatharilii jameen par khodi gai is surang ko baahar dekh kar ye andaja lagaana mushkil he ki ye andar se itnaa bada or vyavasthit bhi ho saktaa he, lekin is surang kii hakeekat kuch aisi hi he
 This tunnel has been built in such a way that only one person can go through it at a time, but at different turns inside, the terrorists have made it to the pucca room under this tunnel, where there are many arrangements to stay
 phir chaahe wo bistar, sheesha yaa davaaiyaan jaisi rozmarra kii chizein hon yaa phir khaane-pine kii zarurat ke liye sabzi-bhaaji jaisi chizein
 These tunnels are undoubtedly long, but its design has been taken special care of its strength
 shaayad isi vajah se in surangon ko zyaada chaudaa nahin khoda gaya or jahaan inamen thaharne ke liye chaudee jagahen bani hai, wo neeche se ladki yaa aisi kisi duusari chizon kaa saport bhi lagaaya gaya he
 If the workers of the city were used to create the beauty, according to the information, then ISIS fighters, especially machine gunners, grenade attackers and human bombs have been camping here for a long time
 ye or baat he ki lambey samay se mosul ke is sunni bahul shahar main kabza jamaaye baitheissake aatankwaadiyon ne ye surangen khud nahin khodi, balki iske liye unhone isi shahar ke mazdooron kaa istemaal kiya
 The terrorists had given these laborers the task of constructing a tunnel by cutting stones from the land for $ 2
 america or vietnami style main banaae surangahaalanki, jaankaron kii maane to dushmano se bachane ke liye surangon kaa istemaal duniya main pehle bhi kai baar or jagah-jagah ho chukaa he
 Seeing the kind of tunnels ISIS has built here, it is suspected that these terrorists have imitated the technology of the Americans and the Vietcong fighters who fought the South Vietnamese army
 apane vakt main vietcong ke surang itane mashhoor the ki inkaa jaal 200 kilometre se zyaada ke daayre main failaa hua tha
 Due to these tunnels, they continued to fight guerrilla war for a long time
 philistin or isroyal ke bich gaaza pattee par hamaas ke surang bhi ek vakt khaase charche main rahe
 Baghdadi can no longer be saved Now Baghdadi has become like a sailor who has several holes in the boat simultaneously
 wo ek chhed band karata he, to duusare se pani bharne lagata he
 Baghdadi, who survived many times in the face of death, is now trying to bring life to his terrorists in Mosul, but the condition is that more than half of the terrorists have agreed that they are not even rebelled against the army and the opponents
 Seeing himself surrounded by all four sides of the battlefield, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi is now undoubtedly able to survive through these crooked tunnels
 The mamid is searching, but according to experts, the day is not far when Baghdadi will soon succumb to the death of the Iraqi army or Kurdish fighters like its own operatives
 bagdadi kii aakhri lokation kii jaankaree nahinkurdish raksha mantri kareem sinjuri kii maane to bagdadi ke bare main khabar he ki ab se teen roj pehle tak bagdadi mosul main hi dekha gaya tha, jo dum dabaa kar bhaagate apane aatankwaadiyon kii hausala afajaai kar unamem jaan foonkane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 But, what is his exact and final location now, no one currently knows
 isliye hui mosul kii ye halatamosul kii ye haalat isliye hui he, kyonki iraqi fouj ke 50 hajaar javaanon ne chaaron ore se mosul main chhipe 6 se 7 hajaar aatankwaadiyon ko gher liya he
 They are now being killed selectively
 aise main dusron ko barbar tareeke se maut ke ghat utaaranevaale iesas ke jallaadon ko ab apni maut khoff sataane laga he
 The situation is that now seeing the army moving towards it, ISIS has started using its last weapon in the form of human bombs, but according to the experts, even this juggle will not last long
 chunaav ayog ne matdaan se 48 ghante pehle prachaar abhiyaan band karne ke kanoon ke ek praavdhaan main sanshodhano ko lekar salaah dene ke liye ek panel gathit kiya he
 This has been done after complaints of failing to keep pace with election law with information technology
 is panel kii adhyakshata varisht up chunaav ayukta umesh sinha karenge
 It will have eight other members from the Election Commission
 samiti main kanoon mantralay, soochna praudyogiki mantralay or soochna evam prasaaran mantralay se ek-ek sadsy honge
 Two other members will be from the Press Council of India and the National Broadcasters Association
 yah panel agle teen maheenon main chunaav ayog ko apni report saunp degaa
 The move to set up the committee has come in the wake of controversies arising out of the FICCI meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, TV interviews of Rahul Gandhi and the issuance of bjp's election manifesto (all after the Gujarat Assembly elections were over)
 maaloom ho ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan ek tivi channel nerahul gandhi ke intervuka prasaaran kiya tha, jisko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 The Election Commission sent a notice to Rahul Gandhi regarding the matter and ordered an FIR to be registered against the channel that showed the interview
 haalanki baad main congress ke kade virodh ke baad ayog ne notice waapas le liya tha
 Apart from this, during the Gujarat Assembly elections, the BJP had released its manifesto, which was also a lot of controversy

 Arvind Kejriwal has quit AAP
 kejariwal ke samarthakise balidaan bataa rahe hai,jabaki unke virohikamayaabi mil jane ke baad doston, saathiyon, humraahiyon or puraani chizon se pallaa jhaad lene kii fitrat qaraar de rahe hai
 As indicated, Kejriwal has approved the decision to form a new party
 kejariwal nahin chaahate the ki kisi bhi keemat par aap tukdon main bante
 For this, he also cited the example of justice of King Solomon
 kumaar vishwaas ne karaayaa samjhautambedkar jayanti paraap ke baagiyon kii ore se yojit 'swaraj samvaad' kii purv sandhya par is samjhaute ko donon pakshon kii maukhik manjuuri mil gai - or iske saath hi jhagada bhi khatm ho gaya he
 Since Kejriwal's return to Bangalore from treatment, the talks between the two sides have been going on, in which there have been many ups and downs
 isamen sabase badi bhoomika kumaar vishwaas ne nibhaai
 From the very beginning, Kumar remained a dialogue bridge between the two sides - and managed to make it to the end
 ab 'aap' nahin 'main''main' - nai party kaa sankshep main yahi naam hoga
 In fact, the short form of the party in English is becoming 'MAIN' which has a detailed form - 'I am not a common man'
 ek or naam bhi sujhaayaa gaya tha - 'mujhe ab inkaar nahin', lekin kejariwal ne ise puri tarah khaarij kar diya
 This name contained within it a large canvas which corresponds to Kejriwal's interest in favor of agreements according to changes in politics and circumstances
 masalan - 'mujhe muslim politics', 'dalit yaa jatigat raajnneeti', 'voton kii kharid-farokht', 'asahmat netaaon ko laat maarane' or 'raajnneeti ke tamaam hatkandon se inkaar nahin' jaise jumalon main feet baithta he
 Apart from the proposed form of the new party, a lot of things related to the new party have also been finalized
 nai party se judi khaas-khaas baaten is prakaar hai:simbel- jaisaa ki nai party kaa naam he - main, isliye sab kuch usee hisaab se hoga
 For the first time in the world, the face of the party's founder, Kartadharta, will become a part of the party symbol
 nai party kaa simbel green uniform main vaikum clinar ke saath ek vyakti hoga
 This person will be none other than Kejriwal himself
 chunki party main le de kar vahi ek cheharaa ban paae hai isiilie ye faisla liya gaya he
 Flag- The flag of the new party will be in black and white color
 kejariwal kaa maananaa he ki politics main sab kuch blike and white hona chahie or duusare rangon kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 Slogan - The proposed party's slogan would be - 'I have no business'
 ise bhi kejariwal ke bhaashanon se liya gaya he
 The inside thing is that through this, an attempt has been made to give a message to everyone that in the new system, there will be no place for anyone
 iskaa makasad ye he ki bhavishya main kisi bhi tarah kii baghawat kii gunjaaish na ho
 muffler-kejriwal has replaced Muffler again after handing over the cap to AAP
 har mausam main mafalar liya ja sake isliye ab 'samar mafalar' bhi taiyaar karaae jaaenge
 These mufflers will be similar to those used in Banaras
 lok sabha chunaavon ke liye banaras pravaas ke dauraan kejariwal ne gamche kii khaasiyat ko thik se samajha
 When he saw people walking in the ghats and streets wearing red skirts
 baad main jab dukaan yaa daftar jate hai to gamchaa gale main najar aata he - or jab dhoop nikalati he to log use sir par rakh lete hai
 The new Angavastram will be the same as the Gamcha but it will be called Muffler
 is mafalar ke kaaran hi 'main' party kaa kaaryakarta ab 'mafalaraman' ke naam se janaa jayega
 Constitution- There will be no written constitution of 'I'
 asal main nai party ke paas na to itnaa vakt he or na hi koi aisa vyakti jo samvidhan likh sake
 Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan used to do such works earlier
 isliye ab kejariwal ke bhaashanon se hi party kaa nayaa samvidhan taiyaar hoga
 For this, a commission will be created which will sort out a special point from Kejriwal's speeches and ensure that the constitution can be added together
 somnath bharti ko iskaa chairman banaae jane kii charchaa he
 Like Bharti, marginalized and unemployed Rakhi Bidlan may be the co-chairperson of this commission
 'aap' kaa apadated varjanab aap kii sena ke pramukh yogendra yadav honge
 Apart from them, Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan and Shalini Bhushan will be the three main commanders of this new army with the original form

 'even today Mohammed Rafi's face comes in front of the eyes even after listening to this song
 yaa duusare chor se dekhen, to mohammad rafee kaa naam yaad aate hi yahi geet sabase pehle antar main bajane lagata he
 Today, 36 years have passed since Bollywood's most famous playback singer Mohammad Rafi Saheb, on 31 July, but whether the songs are romantic songs, painstaking songs, wedding atmosphere, patriotic songs or bhajans, the magic of his songs remains intact
 
 punjab ke kotla sultan singh gaanv main 24 disambar, 1924 ko ek madhyamvargeey muslim parivaar main janme rafee sahab bachapan main ek fakir ke gaae geeton ko bahut dhyaan se suna karte the or unheen se prerana lekar aakhirkaar vah suron or awaz kii duniya ke betaj badshaah bane
 As a child, he was supported and helped by his family to fulfill his hobbies and started studying music from Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore
 iske alaava rafee sahab ne gulam ali khan se bhartiya shastreey sangeet bhi siikhaa
 Rafi Sahab, the voice of the most famous actors of his time, is probably the only singer from India who sang for any other playback singer

 And 'mischief' include 'ajab Hai Dastan Teri Ye Zindagi'
 
 
 ' kishor ke aise geet hai, jinhen mohammad rafee ne kishor kumaar ke liye gaaya
 Though Mohammed Rafi sang his first film song for the 1944 Punjabi film Gul Baloch, which had music director Shyam Sundar, but Naushad gave him the opportunity to sing the first Hindi film song in the film 'pehle Aap'
 varsh 1946 main mumbai aakar bas gaye rafee sahab ne varsh 1949 main naushaad ke hi sangeet nirdesan main 'dulaari' film ke geeton se safalataa kii oonchaaiyon ko chuaa or uske baad kaa lanbaa arsa hindi film jagat main 'rafee kaa yug' kaha jaataa he

 kehete hai, isi kaarykram main shyamsundar maujuud the or unhone hi rafee ko mumbai aane kaa bulaava bheja tha

 Born in a middle-class Muslim family on December 24, 1924 in Kotla Sultan Singh village in Punjab, Rafi Saheb used to listen to the songs sung by a fakir very carefully in his childhood and after being inspired by him, he eventually became the uncrowned king of the world of sound and voice
 
 bachapan main unhen apane parivaar se bhi shauk ko puraa karne main sahyog or madad mili or unhone lahore main ustad abdul vaahid khan se sangeet kii shiksha leni shuru kar di
 Apart from this, Rafi Sahab also learned Indian classical music from Ghulam Ali Khan

 The Supreme Court raised the question in the case, 'when you give your personal data to private companies like Apple, then what is the problem in giving this data to the government? What is the difference between these two cases? You surrender your information to private parties and there is a demand to stop giving data to the government

 Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked that if a private person disrupts someone's privacy, what will be his treatment? On the other hand, Justice Kaul said, "if a private person disrupts someone's privacy, then compensation will not be enough

 The government has approved a development package of Rs 2000 for the displaced people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) living in the country
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali kendriya cabinet ne grih mantralay ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di, taaki 36 hajaar 384 pariwaron ko badi hui aarthik sahaayta di ja sake
 Most of these people who have been displaced from pok after independence are living in Jammu region
 tippaniyan a senior official said that around 5 as assistance to each family
 5 lakh rupee milenge
 Most of the refugees from West Pakistan are from pok, who have settled in different places in Jammu, Kathua and Rajouri districts

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) This statement by the CBI director is extremely disgusting and condemnable
 sattebaaji ko kanoonee jama pehanaane kii maang karnaa bilkul vaisaa hi he, jaise yah kahana ki balaatkaar se bachanaa sambhav na ho to uskaa anand lenaa chahie
 His statement clearly shows the kind of mentality that many men in high positions have about women
 yah bahut afsos kii baat he ki unke shabdkosh main is tarah ke muhaavarey shaamil hai, jo stri ke prati anadar kaa bhav rakhte hai or jo balaatkaar kii shikaar mahilaon ke liye behad apmanjanak hai
 Even more regrettable is that he apologized half-heartedly using agar-magar on his statement
 agar meri baton se koi aahat hua he, to mujhe is baat kaa dukh he yaa mere bayaan ko galat dhang se pesh kiya gaya
 People like him make use of such sentences whenever they make any irresponsible, objectionable and insensitive statements
 kuch log mahila kaaryakartaaon par aarope lagaate hai ki ve is tarah ke bayanon par kuch zyada hi ho-hallaa karti hai
 Such people say, let go
 kisi ne kuch bol hi to diya he
 These statements should not be overstated and should be ignored
 in logon kaa kahana he ki sibiai nideshak ne jab apni ore se ‘‘maafee’’ maang hi lee he to use jabardasti itnaa lanbaa khinchne kii kya jarurat
 Now this case should be ended
 lekin yah maamla baaki maamalon se alag he
 It is not just a matter of using unacceptable language by one person
 ranjit sinha ek aisi agency ke pramukh hai, jo striyon ke shaareerik utpeeda or hinsa ke saikadon maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The moment Sinha is making these statements, this investigation is also going on at the same time
 ye maamle sibiai ko isiilie saunpe gaye, kyonki jin rajyon main ye maamle ghatit hue, vahaan kii police mahilaon ko nyaay dilaane main aksham sabit hui thi
 Suspicion of collusion between police and criminals has been expressed in these cases
 agar aisi mahatvapurn agency kaa pramukh is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal karata he or balaatkaar ke aparaadh ke prati samvedanheen ravaiya vyakt karata he to baaki agenciyon main iskaa bahut nakaaratmak sandesh jayega
 Rape crimes are taken lightly
 yahi kaaran he ki bharat main balaatkaar ke doshiyon ko sajaa dilaane kii dar bahut kam he
 The agencies do not give adequate importance to the investigation in these cases, while at present the rate of rape crime is increasing fastest in India
 desh kii adaalaton main mahilaon ke khilaaf yon utpeeda or balaatkaar ke ek lakh se bhi zyada maamle lambit pade hue hai
 But despite all the promises made by the government and other agencies after the heinous incident of Delhi gangrape, efforts are not being made to improve the law fast enough for speedy justice
 sibiai nideshak kaa bayaan mahilaon ke prati police ke samvedanheen ravaie ko or bhi majbootee degaa
 Such statements of people in powerful positions will further reinforce the already existing atmosphere in which it is believed that men will remain men, and they should be given some relaxation in the use or attitude of language
 unke bayanon par zyada shor nahin machaaya janaa chahie
 But for a woman it is an encroachment of her democratic rights
 daftar, sadak, bas yaa ghar yaa kahin bhi mahila kaa sammaan kisi bhi samaaj main loktantric mulyon kaa suchak hota he
 On this scale, India's model of democracy needs a lot of improvement
 jis tarah se chune hue netaaon, ucch adhikariyon yaa taqatvar padon par baithe hue purushon ke dwaara striyon ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan badhate ja rahe hai, use dekhte hue ab samay aa gaya he ki aise logon ko apni tippanee ke liye kanoonee taur par jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie or unhen isaki sajaa milani chahie
 In the case of leaders, there should be a valid code of conduct by Parliament and legislatures, according to which if a person makes objectionable statements about women, they will be publicly condemned
 agar vah vyakti us tarah kaa bayaan doharaata he to is sthiti main kuch samay ke liye use uske pad se nilambit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 In the case of officers, the rules of service should also be changed so that on making such a statement, the officers can be punished on the ground of misconduct 
 jab unhen is baat kaa dar hoga ki koi aapattijanak bayaan dene par unka kariyar bhi khatre main pad saktaa he to ve darenge or is tarah kaa koi bhi bayaan dene se pehle do baar sochenge
 The initiative to hold the CBI director accountable should be done by the courts
 sarkaar yah kaam kabhi nahin kar sakati kyonki sibiai unke bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 cbi-related cases are with the Supreme Court following the Supreme Court's stay on the Guwahati High Court's decision on the existence of CBI
 yahi sahi hoga ki adaalatein khud hi ise sangyaan main len or khud is maamle main dakhal den
 The All India Democratic Women's Association (ADWA) has asked the court to intervene in the case

 unhone saaf kaha ki captain ko apane pehle vaale nirnay par kaayam rahanaa hoga
 After this the dispute came to an end there, the Indies team had to bat first
 niyamon kii baat karen, to purush cricket ho yaa mahila cricket donon ke liye ek jaise niyam hai
 The captain cannot change his decision after the toss

 During this period, while Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi participated in the performance of jewelers at jantar-mantar, bjp's Varun Gandhi met Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha with a delegation on this issue
 tippaniyan Addressing the rally of All India Jewelry Dealers and Swarnakar Confederation, Rahul criticized the 'make in India' initiative of the Central Government and mentioned its logo saying that it is a Babbar Lion who wants to 'strangle' small businessmen

 unhone kaha, 'yah keval aapke upar lagaaya gaya utpaada shulk nahin he
 This is your 'assassination attempt'
 aapako maaraa ja rahaa he
 
 lekin aapako kyon maaraa ja rahaa he ? isse kisko phayda pahonchega ? ' The Congress vice-president said, 'first of all it will benefit big industrialists and secondly it will benefit those people who will withdraw money from your benefit through pressure and blackmail
 yah ‘babbar sher’ chah bade udyogpatiyon se sambhddha he or ve aapkaa khun chusna chaahate han or dallali ke jariye paisa bananaa chaahate hai
 It is noteworthy that the government had earlier imposed excise tax on gold in the year 2012, but had to withdraw it after strong opposition from the jewelers

 You are being killed 
 But why are you being killed? Who will benefit from this? ' congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'sarvapratham isse bade udyogpatiyon kaa phayda hoga or doosraa isse un logon ko laabh hoga jo dabaav or blackmel ke raste aapke phaayde main se paisa nikaalenge
 This 'babbar Sher' is associated with six big industrialists and they want to suck your blood and make money through brokerage

 bihar main endie main shaamil koun si party kis seat se chunaav ladegi iskaa faisla ravivaar ko ho gaya
 The state presidents of all the constituents of the NDA announced it by holding a joint press conference
 jediu ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne kaha ki chunaav main sabhi dal jamini str par ek-duusare kaa paraspar sahyog karenge
 BJP state president Nityanand Rai said, 'we will win all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 ’endie dwaara jari suchi ke mutabik kosi or simanchal ilaake main zyaadaatar siton par jediu ummidavaar chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 Bhagalpur and Banka seats have also been handed over to JDU this time by BJP
 vahiin, munger seat jediu ne lok janashakti party se maangi, jisaki keemat kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ko navada seat lok janashakti party ke liye chhodkar chukaani pad rahi he
 JDU is contesting on 5 of the 6 seats in Seemanchal and Koshi
 is ilaake kii arriya seat par bijepi chunaav ladegi
 It is believed that the NDA considered it appropriate to give JDU candidates in these areas due to its minority concentration
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main endie simanchal or kosi kii ek bhi seat par jeet hasil nahin kar pai thi
 The NDA won 31 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and lost 9 seats
 in 9 siton main se do siton par jediu ne jeet hasil kii thi
 With JDU coming to NDA, now only 7 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar will be defeated by NDA
 is baar inamen se 6 siton par jediu chunaav lard rahi hai, jabaki ek seat bijepi ke khate main hai
 Last time RLSP was part of NDA and 3 seats won also came in jdu's share
 bijepi uttar bihar or mithilanchan kii zyaadaatar siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 These 11 seats have been occupied by BJP
 bijepi jin 17 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, unamem se 16 par usne 2014 main kabja jamaaya tha
 In the 2014 elections, the BJP had to lose Bhagalpur seat in the Modi wave
 is seat par 8 hajaar ke antar se bijepi ke shahanvaj hossain kii haar hui thi or iskaa nateeja ye hua ki bhagalpur seat jediu ke khate main chali gai
 Shahnawaz Hussain is considered the big Muslim face of Bihar BJP and NDA
 aise main iskaa khamiyaja gathbandhan ko uthaanaa pad saktaa hai
 In Bihar, BJP and JDU are going to contest 17-17 and LJP 6 seats
 jaaniye aakhir kiske khate main koun si seat gai

 After this, NDA government was formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi at the center, Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) was launched on 3 December 2014 for rural electrification

 Whether the Center wants to provide electricity through any scheme, in reality the work has to be done by the state government

 i call it Big b and the Bachchan bunch
 Dad was hospitalised with Mysthenia Gravis and my sister, cousins and i had gone to visit him
 Being too young to understand what all was going on our parents always made it out to be like an outing so that we would not be disturbed by the hospital and its workings
 When i used to visit my father after his accident on the sets of "coolie" in 1982, seeing him connected to many drips and machines, he used to tell me they were kites that he had got for me
 i was 6 yrs old
 My father was fighting for his life and all i thought about was
 
 
 why is he allowing me to play with these kites ??? The innocence of childhood i guess
 a post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan) on May 31, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT The Allahabad High Court on Friday ordered the Enforcement Directorate to probe the allegations of money laundering against Amar Singh and said that the investigation should begin in two weeks
 hoicourt ne yah aadesh samaajawaadee party ke purv mahasachiv amar singh kii yachika khaarij karte hue diya
 Singh had challenged an FIR lodged against him two years ago in Kanpur
 praathmiki main un par aarope lagaaya gaya tha, ki jab uttar pradesh main sapa kii sarkaar thi, tab vah kathith taur par kai vittiya aniyamittaaon main lipt the
 a bench of Justice Imtiaz Murtaza and Justice SS Tiwari ordered the Enforcement Directorate to initiate the investigation within two weeks and present a status report within a month of the commencement of the investigation
 singh ke khilaaf kanpur sthit babupurva police thane main 15 oktober, 2009 ko ek sthaneey nivasee shivakant treepathi ne bhartiya dand samhita kii vibhinn dhaaraon, bhrashtachar nirodhak adhinium or dhan shodhan adhinium ke tahat praathmiki darj karai thi
 This same FIR was challenged by Singh in the High Court
 treepathi ne bhi adaalat se sampark kiya tha or anurodh kiya tha ki maamle kii jaanch pravartan nideshaalay se karai jaae
 The petitions of Singh and Tripathi were adjourned and the bench heard
 iske baad 28 march ko peeth ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 The command of Jharkhand is in the hands of a non-tribal leader for the first time and the people of the state have given a coalition a majority for the first time
 is sarkaar se ummiden apaar hai, to naukarshahi kii nakel ko kasnaa badi chunauti he
 Recently, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das, who did not delay at all to remove even the Chief Secretary, has given the message that now not only duty but accountability will be fixed
 unhone dilli main india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata santosh kumaar se vishesh baatcheet main rajya ke masalon par bebaaki se apni raay rakhi
 Question- How was your government's experience so far and what are your priorities ahead? Answer - The achievement of thirty days is that the public's trust in the government has returned
 abhi main bajet kii prakriya main laga hum or meri praathamikta infrastracchar, shiksha, swasthya or berozegaar naujavaanon ke haathon main hunar dena he
 For which we have started adding corporate, experts while broadening the scope of the State Skill Development Mission
 saath hi piesu ko bhi jod rahe hai
 Skill is to be developed keeping in view the industry that is going to be set up in those areas
 swarozgaar ke madhyam se apni jeevika bhi chalaa sake iske liye bhi is madhyam se prayaas hoga
 Apart from this, we are forming the State Development Council which will include the government and all our 14 Lok Sabha mps
 iske saath visheshgy or korporate sector bhi honge
 This committee will compulsorily meet every three months, whose aim is to make a policy for the development of the state and then the government should move forward on it
 usee tarah 12 kshetron main tribal deveopment council bhi bana rahe hai
 In this, besides the local public representatives, administration, gram panchayat etc
, people will be added to it, who are not interested in politics, but want to join the development work
 in sabko milakar tribal deveopment mishan banane kaa he jo gaanvon main jaakar phir gramin ection plan banaae
 Question- Naxalism is a major problem in the state
 bijepi kii niti kathorta se nipatane kii he
 What will be your strategy? Answer - Our strategy will be of two types
 ek taraf ham vikaas karenge to duusari taraf hinsa ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 For example, we will not make any mistake in adopting tit policy
 lekin hamen dhyaan dena hoga ki naksal samasya kyon paidaa hui
 We will end Naxalism in six months in Jharkhand
 vahaan kuch kshetra main hi maovadi hai or baaki kshetron main asaamaajik tatv ke log hai
 There are organizations like PLFI, TPC which are doing extortion only
 jisamen kahin na kahin hamaare bhi shashan-prashasan ke log unase mili hue hai
 Such people will be screwed
 or janaakrosh ke kaaran aise logon ko badhaava miltaa he
 We have decided that the soldier will be reinstated not at the district but at the block level so that the people of that village and block come to that appointment
 berogari dur hogi to yah samasya bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 When this problem can end in Kolkata, where Naxalism was born, then why not in Jharkhand? Question- You are saying that public confidence in the state has returned to the government
 aisi kya chijen hui hai jo vishwaas lautaa he ?jawaab-pehla yah tha ki raajnneetik asthirataa kii vajah se majboot ichhashakti vaala netritv nahin tha vah is vidhansabha chunaav main janata ne diya
 There was no fixed bureaucratic responsibility due to lack of strong leadership
 wo sirf duty hi kar rahe the
 Anyway, most of the officials want weak governance so that maximum power remains with the bureaucracy
 lekin ab vah khatm ho rahaa he or naukarshahi ko saaf kah diya he ki hamen paardarshee or javabdeh shashan dena he
 Now the responsibility of bureaucracy has to be decided
 sarkaar ke paas chhipaane ke liye koi cheez nahin rahani chahie or janata ko ek-ek cheez jaanane kaa haq ho ki sarkaar main aakhir kya ho rahaa he
 There has been instability in Jharkhand
 bijepi bhi ajasu kii baisakhi par sarkaar main he
 In such a situation, how can you say that the atmosphere of instability is over? Answer - The period of instability is over
 14 saal kii raajnneeti ko dekhenge to aap paaenge ki ajasu se hamaara chunaav ke baad gathbandhan hota tha, lekin pehali baar hamaara chunaav se pehle gathbandhan hua or ham milakar lade
 The public also gave an absolute majority to the NDA under the leadership of the BJP
 isliye sarkaar sthirataa ke saath puure paanch saal chalegi
 Question: There was a lot of dissatisfaction in the party about the alliance with AJSU and it was alleged that this alliance happened under the pressure of a big corporate house
 jawaab-nahin
 
 
 No
 
 
 yah baat puri tarah galat he
 This decision was taken keeping in mind the political situation of Jharkhand
 rajya main kaaphi chote-chote dal hai or party ne sab kuch kaa akalan karne ke baad hi yah faisla liya
 Nobody has any role in this
 agar bhoomika he to sirf bijepi ke netaaon kii he
 Question- Three states were formed under Vajpayeeji's rule, in which Jharkhand remained the most backward
 What is the reason for this? Answer - Political instability and chaos
 iske kaaran jharkhand par jo daag laga isamen congress kii bahut badi bhoomika thi kyonki rajya main jo bhi sarkaar chalati rahi use asthir karne kaa kaam congress party karti rahi
 Whatever scandals happened were in the Congress-backed regime
 jab-jab congress ne asthirataa paidaa kar sarkaar banaai us shashan main hi bhrashtachar hua or jharkhand kii badanaami hui
 This was understood by the people of Jharkhand and bypassed the Congress
 sawaal-badali hui paristhiti main jharkhand ke vikaas ko teji se aage lekar jaae uske liye aapaki kya ranneeti he?jawaab-jharkhand main apaar sambhaavnaaen hai
 When i had just gone to Vibrant Gujarat, the diaspora had come a lot
 usamen rajyavar bhi pravasi bharatiyon kii baithken huin to 70 pravasi bhartiya maujuud the
 Out of them 17 nris also showed investment interest
 jharkhand ke prati ab logon main lalak thi kyonki sthir sarkaar he
 Now after the budget session, we will discuss the meeting of the diaspora with the CII
 phir 2016 main wibront jharkhand kaa aayojan karenge
 Question- After becoming Jharkhand, for the first time, a non-tribal became the Chief Minister
 adivasee samaaj main naaraaz he?jawaab-samvidhan main kahin nahin likhaa he ki gaiyr adivasee hi siem hoga
 It is a constitutional post
 usamen jati, panth, sampradaay kaa koi vishay hi nahin he
 Some people had this belief and thinking, but some people think that the state and the country does not work, the majority runs
 aapane dekha hoga ki sarkaar gathan ke baad kahin is tarah kii baat nahin ai
 In the matter of education which was not being appointed for 14 years, till the end of January, we have given appointment letters to 7000 primary teachers
 ek hajaar alpsankhyak varg ke shikshakon kii niyukti ham kar chuke hai
 There is nothing like whispering or resentment
 sawaal-jharkhand chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood kasar rah gai or bijepi ko apane boote jo bahumat kii siten milani thi vah nahin mil pai?jawaab-jharkhand main ham log pradhanmantri narendra bhai modi ji ke netritv main chunaav lade
 Modi ji's call was 'if you give us majority, we will give you development', then the people of Jharkhand gave majority
 ab hamaara ferj banataa he ki hamaare pradhanmantri or bijepi ne janata se jo vaayada kiya tha use ham sushasan or vikaas laakar puraa karen, yah hamaari jimmedaari banati he
 Question- There was a movement on electricity and Yashwant Sinha went to jail, but did not come for the entire election
 party main gutbaji saaf dikh rahi he
 Answer - There is no factionalism
 jahaan tak yashavanth sinha ji kaa sawaal he to unhone khud ichha prakat kii thi
 The party gave tickets to his son Jayant Sinha in the Lok Sabha, he won and Narendra Bhai also made him a minister in his government
 kahin koi gutbaji nahin he
 Question- There was political instability in Jharkhand, corruption was very much ahead and most of the time BJP was under rule
 jawaab-bijepi kii sarkaron ke samay koi bhrashtachar nahin hua
 But in the matter of development, we could not fully do what we wanted to do sitting in the government
 ham koi acha kaam karnaa shuru karte the tab tak sarkaar hi gir jaati thi
 Question- What is the concrete strategy to curb corruption? Answer - It is the responsibility of everyone along with the government to end corruption
 ise khatm karne main ham rajya kii janata se bhi sahyog kii ummid rakhte hai
 But the most important thing is that if we fix the system then we feel that we can achieve much success on it
 isliye ham soochna praudyogiki (ity) par kaaphi focus kar rahe hai
 Everything should be online whether it is land dispute or tax, or ration in PDS
 is maamle main ham bharat sarkaar ke jo ity sachiv hai aar
 s
 sarama ke lagaataar sampark main hai
 They belong to our Jharkhand cadre only
 17 farvari ko hamane unhen ranchi bulawaaya he taaki rajasav, peedies se jude adhikariyon ke saath baithak karen
 We will strengthen e-governance more
 sawaal- dharmantaran ek mudda rahaa he
 The Sangh Parivar is also returning home in response to this, is it right in your eyes? Answer - If one changes religion with his will, it is a constitutional right
 lekin koi laalach dekar, garibi kaa nazaij phayda uthaakar dharm parivartan karaata he to yah samvidhan kaa apmaan he
 If such a case comes, the government will definitely take action
 bharat sarkaar ne kaale dhan ke khilaaf muhim tej karne ke mood main dikh rahi he
 Under this, the Indian government is preparing to send a high-level delegation to Switzerland this week
 ye pratinidhimandal geneva ke HSBC bank jayega or vahaan 700 bharatiyon ke bank acount kii ditels khangaalega
 According to Indian Express, an English newspaper, this week the delegation headed by Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das will leave for Geneva
 ye pratinidhimandal geneva main switzraland ke vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ke saath is mudde par baithak bhi karegaa
 The delegation will also include Shaktikanta Das along with KV Chaudhary, Chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Akhilesh Ranjan, Joint Secretary, Foreign Taxation and Tax Research
 ye pratinidhimandal 15 oktober ko geneva main switzraland ke adhikariyon ke saath mulaakaat karegaa
 In the meantime, the delegation will try to collect the information of accounts of 700 Indians in Geneva's HSBC as well as the accounts of Indians who have been opened in Swiss banks
 isse pehle saal 2011 main bharat sarkaar ko 700 aise khaaton kii jaankaree mili thi jinhen geneva ke HSBC bank main kholaa gaya he
 But when the Government of India sought the information related to these accounts from the Swiss Government, the Government there refused to give information about the accounts citing the law there
 uttar pradesh main rajyasabha kii 10 siton ke liye matdaan jari he
 11 candidates are in the fray
 bijepi ne naunven seat par ummidavaar utarkar muqabla rochak bana diya he
 There have been frequent signs of cross voting since morning
 saath hi 2 vidhayakon ko voting se rokkar bijepi ne vipaksh ke siyaasi ganit ko bigaad diya he
 In such a situation, all eyes are on SP candidate Jaya Bachchan and BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar
 kya donon jeetenge yaa phir bijepi kaa ganit safal rahegaa
 If the BJP manages to win its ninth candidate, Anil Agarwal, then only one of the two candidates of the opposition will get a chance to reach the Rajya Sabha
 phir wo koun hoga
 To a large extent, the future of the SP-BSP alliance in UP will also depend on it
 soobe ke maujuuda vidhayakon kii sankhya ke lihaaj se bijepi kii 8 rajyasabha siton par jeet tay he
 BJP has strategized votes to win its ninth candidate
 sutron ke mutabik maujuuda voton ke ganit ke anusaar bijepi do vidhayakon kaa vot nahin dalavaaegi
 In such a situation, now 36 votes will be required for the selection of Rajya Sabha member
 iskaa matlab he ki ab upi main kul 398 vot hi padenge
 In such a situation, BJP will increase by 8 votes even more
 bijepi agar is formule par chalati he to phir vipaksh ke donon ummidavaar ke jeetne kaa ganit bighad jayega
 While the BJP has also managed to break into the votes of the opposition to win its ninth candidate
 ek nirdaleey vidhayak aman mani or sapa ke nitin agarwal or basapa ke anil singh kaa vot bijepi ke khate main gaya he
 Apart from this, Vijay Mishra of Nishad Party has also voted for BJP candidate
 basapa ko ek vot kii jaruratbaspa ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko abhi tak kul 34 vot mili hai
 It consists of 17 votes of BSP, 10 votes of Samajwadi Party and 7 votes of Congress
 abhi basapa ko jeet ke liye kam se kam 2 se 3 vot chahie
 However, the BSP candidate has to get one vote of the RLD MLA
 iske baavjood jeetne ke liye bispi ko ek vot kii or jarurat he
 In such a situation, will Akhilesh Yadav vote for any of his mlas for BSP
 bispi ke vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari ko vot daalane kii anumati court ne nahin di he
 Apart from this, an BSP MLA Anil Singh has done cross voting
 is tarah do vot kam ho gaye hai
 SP has made Jaya Bachchan a candidate
 sapa ke paas maujuuda samay main 47 vidhayak hai
 Of these, Nitin Aggarwal has voted for BJP candidate by cross voting
 iske alaava duusare vidhayak hariom yadav jail main band he
 In this way, BJP has only 45 votes
 inamen se das vot akhilesh ne pehle hi basapa ummidavaar ko dene kaa vaada kar chuke hai
 In this way 35 votes are left
 sapa ke paas nirdaleey vidhayak ke rup main raghuraaj pratap singh or vinod saroj kaa vot hai
 Which is sure to meet Jaya Bachchan of SP
 is tarah se unke khate main 37 vot ho jaaenge
 The arithmetic of the Rajya Sabha is a fixed formula for the Rajya Sabha elections, divided by the total number of members of the assembly by an addition in the vacant seats
 nishkarsh main bhi ek jodne par jo sankhya aati he
 The same number of votes a member needs to win a Rajya Sabha election
 agar upi kaa udhaaharan liya jaae to 10 siton main 1 joda jaae to yoga hua 11
 Now dividing 403 by 11 then it comes to 36
 63
 If 1 is added to it, the sum is 37
 63
 That is, a member needs the support of 38 mlas to win the UP Rajya Sabha elections
 haalanki bijepi ke ek vidhayak kaa nidhan ho chukaa he
 Two mlas are not allowed by the court
 iske alaava mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi apane do vidhayak se vot nahin karaayegi
 Only 398 members will vote in this way
 aise main ek rajyasabha sadsy ko jeetne ke liye 36 voton kii jarurat padegi
 In such a situation, if there is no breach of votes of BJP, then all its 9 candidates are sure to win
 vahiin vipaksh kii ore se jaya bachchan or bhimrao ambedkar main se kisi ek hi rajyasabha pahonchega

 After the implementation of the Code of Conduct, the BJP has strongly objected to the inclusion of the former BSP MLA in the Congress by Kamal Nath in the ministry
 bijepi ke rashtriya mahaamantri kailash vijayawargeey or pradesh upaadhyaksh vijesh lunaavat ne shuukravaar shaam ko chunaav ayog main mukhyamantri kamalnath kii shikaayat kii he
 In fact, on March 14, bsp's Dimani former MLA Balbir Singh Dandotia was included in the Congress
 dandotiyaa kii joining mantralay ke paanchave tal par karai gai
 Dandotia himself has mentioned this in a video and only after this video has surfaced, BJP has accused Kamal Nath of illegal use of ministry and posts and powers
 bijepi ke mutabik kamalnath kaa yah krity mukhyamantri pad kii shaktiyon or shaskeey karyaalay yani mantralay kaa durupyog he
 Along with this, BJP has also called it a violation of Model Code of Conduct applicable across the country
 bijepi ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki adarsh aachaar samhita lagu ho chuki he lekin aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad bhi shuukravaar ko mukhyamantri kamalnath dwaara bispi ke purv vidhayak balvir singh dandotiyaa ko unke samarthakon ko mantralay main congress party kii sadsyta di gayi jo ki aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 The BJP has also submitted a video to the Election Commission in this matter
 is dauraan kailash vijayawargeey ne aarope lagaaya ki adarsh aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad mukhyamantri kamalnath mantralay main baithkar apane prabhaav kaa durupyog kar rahe he
 Election related meetings of the party are being held in the ministry by Chief Minister Kamal Nath from 10 March
 mantralay ko congress mukhyalay main badal diya gaya he
 With the complaint, we have demanded that the CCTV footage which has been entered into the ministry since March 10, as well as the persons who have been given admission in the ministry, should be investigated
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mantri par kai karod ke rishwat lene kaa aarope laga he
 This charge is not made by any other way, but the CBI DIG has written in the Supreme Court by writing in due course
 sibiai ke diaiji em ke sinha ne apni yachika main likhaa he ki sibiai kaa matlab centre for bogus invastigeshan ho gaya he
 The business of extortion and recovery runs here
 ek afasar kii yachika ke baad bhi dilli main itani shanti he ki lagata he ki aaj news channelon main holi kii chuttee he
 The dock media is now the real India
 kya kar sakate hai

 june 2018 ke pehle 15 dinon main kabhi yah paisa modi sarkaar ke mantri haribhaai parthi bhai choudhary ko diya gaya he
 The charge related to this is even more dangerous

 We quickly tell you about the Moin Qureshi case

 Their case has been going on for 7 years, three directors came during this but the matter did not reach the end
 2011 main upie kii sarkaar main jaanch shuru hui thi, chali gai, modi sarkaar aa gai or maamla vahiin kaa vahiin he balki is maamle ko lekar unke hi rajya mantri zad main aa gaye hai
 During this time, three directors of CBI came and went but the case of Moin Akhtar Qureshi did not reach the end
 raahat fateh ali khan moin kuraishi kii beti kii shaadi main aae the, lautate vakt airport par 56 lakh cash ke saath pakade gaye
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Modi also accused the Congress of this matter
 unki sarkaar aane ke teen saal baad sibiai ne cese darj kiya
 But its investigation overturned the CBI from within
 sibiai ke do-do nideshkon ke naam jaanch ke dauraan aa gaye
 And now Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana face to face in this case
 nideshak e pi singh sibiai se ritair hokar upiessi ke member ban gaye the jahaan se inhen hataanaa padaa tha

 But when Sana recorded his statement, he said that he had given 3 crore to Rakesh Asthana in December 2017

 IPS officer Manish Kumar Sinha has accused Prime Minister Modi's minister of several crore bribes in connection with this case
 yah saamaanya nahin he ki sibiai ke diaiji ne na sirf koyala va khanan rajya mantri shri haribhaai parthi bhai choudhary par rishwat lene ke aarope lagaae balki isi maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal par bhi baqayda likhit rup main apni yachika main aarope lagaae hai
 To interfere and influence in this case
 manish sinha ne kaha he ki jis asthana cese ko wo dekh rahe the, usase hataakar unka tabadalaa nagpur isliye kiya gaya kyonki piemo ke ishaare par shaktishaalee logon ko bachaaya ja rahaa tha
 Evidence was possible
 manish sinha neerav modi or mehul chaukasee kaa bhi cese dekh rahe the
 Has National Security Advisor Ajit Doval interfered in Asthana's investigation, preventing Asthana from raiding and confiscating his phone to save him? Manish Kumar Sinha has written in his petition that the National Security Advisor at several levels created a deadlock in the investigation against Asthana
 is cese main shaamil do midileman ajit dobhaal ke kareebi the
 It was through Dubai middle man Manoj that he was accused of giving money to Asthana, after his arrest Manoj wondered how the CBI could hold him while he was close to Ajit Doval
 uske bhai somesh or ro ke adhikari samant goyal ne ek personal cese main ajit dobhaal kii madad kii thi
 From the investigation against Asthana to the FIR level, Ajit Doval was interested
 yachika main likhaa he ki 5 aktubar ko asthana ke khilaaf exiaar hui thi jisaki soochna alok verma ne ajit dobhaal ko 17 aktubar ko di
 The question is why Alok Verma was telling Ajit Doval that an FIR has been lodged against Asthana and why Ajit Doval was telling Asthana that an FIR has been lodged against you
 kya asthana ne ajit dobhaal se guzarish kii thi ki unki giraftaar nahin honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ne asthana ko giraftaar hone se bachaa liya, yah sab yachika main likhaa gaya he, khandan se to baat nahin banegi, yah maamla ab jaanch se bhi aage kaa ho gaya he
 It has been written in the petition that under the pressure of Ajit Doval, permission was not given to search Asthana's house and his mobile phone was not confiscated
 jaanch adhikari e ke bassi ne aarope lagaae hai, em ke sinha ne apni yachika main yah sab likhaa he ki alok verma ne poochne par kaha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne cell phone zabt karne kii anumati nahin di
 a formal request was made to Alok Verma on 22 October but permission was not granted again
