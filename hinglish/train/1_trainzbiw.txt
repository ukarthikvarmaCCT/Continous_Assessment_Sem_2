 It has successfully held off 2000 times till now

 Despite this it is also a high profile person

 Despite this it is among those politicians who have led the famous Chamarajanagar assembly constituency thrice
 yah bengalooru se bhi do baar vidhayak rah chukaa he
 Born in a modest family, Nagaraj became a councilor in the city of Bangalore in 1964

 He wanted Nagaraj to join Congress but it did not do so and took the path of activism
 agar wo us vakt siyasat kii duniya main kadam rakh detaa to mumkin tha ki wo rajya kaa siem bhi bana jaataa
 He has no regrets why he did not join politics in the beginning

 Whether it is the issue of border forests or the water sharing of Cauvery
 ise pataa he ki kab-kab or kin-kin muddon ko uthaane se use lokapriyata milegi
 In 1960, when 21-year-old Nagaraj was trying to establish himself as the leader of Kannada rights, his path was not easy
 mysore se kareeb ghante bhar kii duuri par sthit vatalu gaanv se taalluk rakhane vaale nagaraj ne shuru main mysore, chamrajanagar or bengalooru jilon main virodh-pradarshnon kii neenv rakhni shuru kii

 Congress leaders regularly visit the area to keep that issue alive

 Therefore, the BJP will be particularly cautious in the months before the elections between the reaping of the kharif crop and sowing of rabi

 Virender Sehwag, who has become famous due to his distinct style of sending messages, has shared a photo of Kumble in his tweet in which this former leg-spinner is seen bowling with a bandage in his head
 darasal westeindies ke khilaaf test ke dauraan ballebaaji karte samay gend lagane se kumble kaa jabada tut gaya tha
 Seeing the need of the Indian team later in the match, he tied up in the head and went to bowling despite unbearable pain
 team ke prati is samarpan bhav ke kaaran us samay kumble ko duniyabar main prashansa hasil hui thi
 Wishing Kumble a birthday, the BCCI wrote something like this, after criticism, the corrective mistake Happiest birthday to one of India's greatest ever match winners, a man who defined grit and courage

 The Supreme Court has rejected the petition seeking disqualification of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar from the post
 court ne kaha ki is yachika main koi merit nahin he
 During the hearing, the Election Commission said that Nitish had disclosed the murder FIR in his 2012 election affidavit
 isse pehle chunaav ayog ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kar kaha he ye yachika sunwaayee yogya nahin he ise khaarij kiya jaae
 The petition is 'trivial' and based on erroneous facts
 isamen di gai jaankaree gumraah karne vaali he or ye adalati prakriya kaa durupyog he
 The comments ayog ne kaha ki niteesha kumaar ne 2012 or 2015 main bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin ladaa tha
 Similarly, he did not contest even the Bihar Legislative Council elections in 2013, but it is not known from where the petitioner ML Sharma obtained the election affidavit of Nitish Kumar
 is maamle se yachikakarta ke koi moulik adhikaron kaa hanan nahin hua he or janhit yachika daakhil nahin kii ja sakati
 The petitioner should have given the election petition or complaint to the police

 It is to be noted that advocate ML Sharma has filed a petition saying that during 2004 to 2015, Nitish Kumar did not disclose in the affidavit that he had filed an FIR in the murder case in 1991
 jisase nitish kumaar apane aapraadhik record ko chupaane ke baad sanvaidhanik pad par nahin rah sakate hai
 The Commission said that Nitish Kumar had not contested the elections to Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2012 and 2015
 isi tarah unhone 2013 main bhi bihar vidhaan parishad bhi chunaav nahin ladaa lekin pataa nahin yachikakarta emel sharma ne kahaan se nitish kumaar ke chunavi halafname hasil kar liye
 No fundamental rights of the petitioner have been violated in this case and Public Interest Litigation cannot be filed
 yachikakarta ko chunaav yachika yaa shikaayat police ko deni chahie thi
 This petition should be dismissed and the petitioner should be fined heavily
 gauratlab he ki vakil emel sharma ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki 2004 se 2015 ke dauraan nitish kumaar ne halafanaame main ye khulaasa nahin kiya ki 1991 main un par hatya ke maamle main exiaar darj hui thi
 Due to which Nitish Kumar cannot remain in constitutional post after concealing his criminal record

 com / dqgwyehq0b According to the deadline of the central government, all taxpayers will have to complete their Aadhaar and PAN linking by 31 August
 yadi koi karadaata is avadhi tak apane pan or aadhaar ko link karaane main vifal rahaa he to vitt varsh 2016-17 ke liye daakhil uski inakam tex ritern kii processing nahin kii jaaegi
 Therefore, if you have filed your Income Tax Return (ITR) by August 5 but have not been successful in getting Aadhaar and PAN linked, then your return will not be considered for the said financial year
 bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran (yuidiai) ne kaha he ki kardataon ke liye apane pan ko aadhaar se jodne kii nirdhaarit samaysima kaayam rahegi or ucchtam nyaayalay ke niztaa par faisle se is aavashyaktaa par koi prabhaav nahin hoga
 UIDAI Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ajay Bhushan Pandey said that the imperative to provide Aadhaar for availing government subsidies, social schemes and other benefits will also continue for the present
 sarkaar ne pan ko aadhaar se jodne kii samaysima badhaakar 31 agast kar di he
 What will be the effect of linking Aadhaar and PAN with the decision of the Supreme Court? The CEO of UID said, adding PAN to Aadhaar has been made mandatory through amendment in the Income Tax Act
 kanoon ke tahat yah kaam jari rahegaa
 There will be no change in it
 ise bhi padhein: ab dalal street par kalaadhan nahin hoga safed, aadhaar karegaa nigaraaneeuaidi kii taraf se saaf kiya ki chaahe aadhaar kanoon ke praavdhaanon ke tahat ho yaa iskar kanoon yaa mani landring kanoon ke tahat, vibhinn samaysimaaon kaa paalan karnaa hoga kyonki ye kanoon vaid hai
 The UID expressed confidence that the Aadhaar law would meet the fundamental right to privacy through its data protection safeguards
 yuaidi kii taraf se yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aadhaar ke liye namakan bhi bina kisi aadchan ke jari rahegaa
 He said that the Aadhaar Act already contains provisions for the protection of privacy
 isamen bina sambandhit vyakti kii sahmati ke data ko saajha nahin kiya jaataa he
 This is an easy method of aadhaar-pan linking, however, it is a routine decision to make the last date of aadhaar-pan linking by 31 August and linking of Aadhaar and PAN will be done in the country even after this date
 aadhaar pan linking kii aakhri taarikh par bolte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne safai di he ki liking kaa yah kaam ek satat prakriya he or desh main jaise-jaise nae pan or aadhaar banate rahenge, linking kaa kaam jari rahegaa
 Also read: Do not file IT returns, do PAN to prevent it from being rejected, AADHAR was stuck 11
 44 lakh PAN number, aise pataa karen apane pan kii validitylihaaja, jinke paas yah donon dastavej nahin hai or unhen philhal banking or anya kaarobaar athwa kendra sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa laabh nahin lenaa he unke liye liking kii yah aakhri taarikh koi myne nahin rakhti
 If an Aadhaar holder does not have a PAN, he can get it voluntarily made
 kyon jaruri he pan card or isaki aadhaar se linkingne pan card se bainkon ke liye graahakon kaa pan card vairiffication kaa kaam behad aasaan ho jayega
 With the help of QR code, it can be completed in just a few seconds
 vahiin puraane pan card main card holder ke vairiffication kii prakriya behad penchidi thi or adhik samay lagata tha
 It is important to note that linking of PAN and Aadhaar is very important to curb black money in the country and to prevent theft from programs of central government development

 venezuela se varshon pehle mili sone ke ek vishaal tukade ko duniya kaa sabase bada swarna pind mana gaya he
 The price of this gold ingot is about nine crores, and its weight is 217
 78 gram or aakaar golf kii gend itnaa bada he
 Geologist John Racovan of the University of Miami said, "never before has such a large body of gold been studied, and we now have the opportunity to do so
" 'rakovan evam anya shodhakarta jatil upkarnon kaa upyog kar is vishaal sone ke pind kii aantarik sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya

 The researchers found that this body of gold is made of a single gold crystal, which is rare in itself
 is sone ke tukade ke america maalik ke paas aise chaar tukade hai, jisamen se ek unhone rakovan ko adhyayan ke liye uplabdh karavaaya
 These four huge pieces of gold were found decades ago by a river in Venezuela

 Not even 2016 changed

 Bengal did not change
 bengal sirf kolkata nahin he
 Bankura is also outside Kolkata

 There is also Shanti Niketan in Virbhum and Subalpur

 Turning from the main road to the left, there is a village on the right in the forest along the banks of a canal

 Nobody there wants to talk about the incident that happened in January of 2014
 jo bhi baat karata he fusfusaakar baat karata he
 After all, an issue like whispering love jihad is the thing to whisper

 People say that he is very strong
 hongi
 But statistics show that Mamta's hold on law and order is worse
 salishi sabha vaala subalpur cond sirf ek misaal he
 During the same period, there were many incidents for which Mamata Banerjee should have been ashamed as a Chief Minister
 jaraa giniega, farvari 2012 main kolkata ke park street main rape cond hua, mamata ne is balaatkaar ko jhootha bataaya, vardhaman ke katwa main rape cond hua jisamen mahila kaa uski beti ke saamne balaatkaar kiya gaya, mukhyamantri mamata ne kahah yah juthi sajeesh he
 The victim is a member of the CPI (M)

 In January 2014, an employee of a fitness center in South Kolkata is abducted in a truck and raped by 5 people
 june 2014 main kaamduni main college chaatra kaa rape kar uski hatya kar di jaati he
 Mamata Banerjee describes women who have come on Mukhalafat as Maoists
 yah un balaatkaaron kii suchi he jo media kii najar main aae, or media ke jariye logon kii nigaah-zabaan par chadhe
 But the figures of 2014 become even more frightening in 2015 and 2016
 neshnal krime records beuro (enciarabi) ke saal 2016 ke aankade pashchim bengal main mahilaon ke prati badhate aparaadhon kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 There is also a list of increasing cases related to women trafficking in these crimes and this is a dangerous trend
 jaankaar kehete hai ki pashchim bengali kii raajnneeti main tezaabi bayaanbajiyaan hoti hai
 But the acid attack there is also used in an equally effective manner against women
 2016 main, enciarabi kahata he
 Out of 283 total acid attacks across the country, 76 were in Bengal only
 yani 26 fisadi
 1,10,434 cases of cruelty against women have been registered across the country and out of them 19,305 cases i
e
 around 17% have been reported only in Bengal
 maanav taskari main bhi bengal peeche nahin he or desh bhar main maanav taskari kaa 44 fisadi maamle bengal se hi hue hai
 In 2016, a total of 8,132 cases were registered across the country and in Bengal it was 3,579 cases
 mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon main bengal ne hameshaa apni sharmnaak oonchi paaydaan barkaraar rakhi he
 In the year 2016, about 10 per cent (9) of crimes against women in Bengal, with a high number of crimes against women with 32,513 cases
 6 fisadi) hissaa hota he
 However, the argument would be that on this position, bjp-ruled Uttar Pradesh is on the first place and West Bengal on the second place, but in Bengal only 7 of the total female population of the country
 5 fisadi hi he, jabaki upi main desh kii 17 fisadi mahilaayein hi rahati hai
 Despite the high rate of crimes against women in Bengal, the administration has done little about it
 khatarnaak baat yah he ki pashchim bengal main na to rajya sarkaar ko isaki parvaah he or na hi trinmul congress ko chunauti de rahi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke liye koi chunavi mudda
 The West Bengal Women's Commission and the West Bengal Child Rights Protection Commission have also not taken any concrete initiative in this direction
 bharat main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon main sajaa dene kii dar 18
 9 percent, but surprisingly only 3 in West Bengal
 3 fisadi hi he
 But surprisingly, as i said in the beginning, in politics the slogans go ahead and the facts are left behind
 bhavanaaen baari hoti hai or asaliyat ko darkinar kar diya jaataa he
 When i wanted to comment on a crime against women in Bengal from a professor of Shanti Niketan and a woman journalist in Kolkata, both of them defended Bengal with the same answer: In which state do the crimes not happen? i said no, in politics If the slogans are heavy on facts, people will take the support of ideology and will come in support of it

 '370 kaa maharashtra se kya sambandh is sawaal ke jawaab main kripashankar ne kaha ki maharashtra desh se alag nahin he
 He said, 'there was an incident in Pulwama and when there was an air strike on Balakot, then our leaders first supported it
 us samay rahul gandhi ji kaa saport kiya or phir iskaa virodh kiya
 While the discussion was going on in the country at that time, BJP would not go beyond 200 seats

 India may have won the Kargil war between India and Pakistan, but it exposed our defense preparedness and the ability to take the right decisions at the right time
 kai logon kaa aisa maananaa tha ki agar kargil yuddh ke samay ahm faisle lene main der na kii gai hoti, to desh ko kam nuksaan uthaanaa padataa
 Many soldiers lost lives Janjoon, In 2004, the ruling Congress Party accused the ruling NDA government during the Kargil War that many of our soldiers lost their lives due to delay in taking important decisions
 akhbaar kii ek report kaa hawala dete hue congressi netaa ashvini kumaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki desh kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad hua he, isliye isaki puri jaanch kii jaaegi

 nahin tay kii ja saki jimmedaaritab centre sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi marxvaadi communist party ne bhi congress ke sur main sur milaate hue is maamle ke jimmedaar logon ke kilaaf karrwai kii maang kii thi
 In response to these allegations, BJP had said that Congress is raising the issue of Kargil to divert attention from the controversy arising out of including its tainted ministers in the cabinet
 kul milakar nateeja 'dhak ke teen paat' vaala rahaa
 In 2004, the then NDA government gave a clarification in this regard by the then Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 unhone is masale par purvavarti endie sarkaar ko 'clinit' dete hue kaha ki kargil yuddh ke dauraan na to sarkaar or na vayusena kii ore se kisi tarah kii kotahi barti gai

 Excerpts: The Lok Sabha election results may have dealt a big blow, with the Congress getting just one seat in Madhya Pradesh
 kya yah rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf aayaa janadesh mana jaae?nahin, chunaav parinaam puri tarah se centre kii sarkaar ke liye the
 The gullible voters also knew that the election was for the central government
 thik vidhansabha chunaavon kii tarah jisamen narendra modi ne jor-shor se prachaar kiya tha, lekin nateeja vaisaa nahin rahaa, kyonki janata jaanati thi ki isse modi kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Similarly, he knew that the Lok Sabha election was related to Modi and had nothing to do with the state government
 madhya pradesh main apni party kii buree haar ke kaaran istipha dekar ek nayaa janadesh lene ke bare main aapane nahin sochaa kya?bilkul nahin kyonki meri sarkaar ne 25 disambar ko shapath lee thi or mujhe apana kaam dikhaane ke liye sirf 75 din mili the
 In those 75 days before the Code of Conduct came into force, no work was done in any state at that pace
 lihaaja istife kaa to sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota
 Yes, if i had been in this post for three or four years and would have got such a result then i probably would have needed to think so
 congress kii lagaataar haar
 With about 50 seats folded, are these signs of party destruction? Has the Congress become irrelevant as a national party? When i was an MP, the BJP had only two seats in Parliament at that time
 aisa hota rahata he, main samajhataa hum ki koi bhi parinaam utaar-chadhaav ke khel kaa hissaa hota he
 The larger the mandate, the faster the sliding speed, because the expectations are much higher
 janata sochane lagati he ki uske saath dhokhaa hua he
 In this election we failed to answer even those issues which had nothing to do with Modi's performance or his promises
 kya the ve mudde?modi rashtrawaad kaa mudda lekar aae jisase mujhe hairaani hui kyonki bhaajapa main aisa ek bhi naam nahin—na to aaj yaa ateet main—jisane aazaadee kii ladaai main koi bhoomika nibhaai ho
 Nevertheless, he continued to raise the slogan of nationalism

 It is heard that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has said that Ashok Gehlot, p
 chidambaram or aapane koi kaam nahin kiya or apane beton ke chunaav abhiyaanon par zyada dhyaan dete rahe
 Did you give your 100%? i was in Chhindwara for a day
 log mujhe 40 saal se vot dete rahe hai or desh main sabase lambey samay tak saansad bane rahane ke naate mujhe vahaan samay bitaane kii jarurat nahin
 Therefore, there is no question of paying attention to the son winning the election
 main rajya main har din chunaav abhiyaan par nikalataa rahaa or jab rahul yahaan the, tab bhi main unke sabhi kaaryakramon main unke saath tha
 It was also heard that Rahul Gandhi believes that leaders like AAP did not properly raise the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' in their public meetings and did not give impetus to the Congress campaign
 kya koi khaas vajah thi?hamaare sabhi abhiyaanon main 'chaukeedaar chor he', kaa naaraa lagata rahaa
 But the reality is that the campaign does not depend on just one slogan
 modi ko apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main adhure kaamon yaa kisaanon se kiye adhure vaadon par apni vifaltaa ko chhipaana tha
 He was able to divert public attention from real issues like employment and economic development
 unhone kuch anya muddon ko uthaaya jinhen logon ne hathohath liya
 Rahul Gandhi has indicated that he wants to step down as Congress President
 mujhe lagata he ki rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh pad par bane rahanaa chahie, kyonki jab sthiti bigadati he, tab aapako apni jagah par majbootee se rahanaa chahie or jab sthiti behatar ho, tab beshak aap jagah chhodie kaa faisla kar sakate hai
 Right now our situation is fragile, so, they should not talk about leaving the post

 The electoral atmosphere was built on issues we were not able to face
 unke (bhaajapa) abhiyaan kaa majamoon hamaare muddon se bilkul alag tha or janata kaa samarthan unhen hi mila
 If Rahul Gandhi really quits, will he be replaced by Priyanka Gandhi or will someone outside the Gandhi family take over? i have not imagined the Congress without Rahul Gandhi
 dekhte hai
 i have not thought about it yet
 congress ko phir se apana mukaam hasil karne ke liye kya karnaa chahie?sabase mahatvapurn yah he ki bhaajapa kii chunavi mashinari congress se zyada majboot he
 They have RSS, Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Saraswati Shishu Mandir and 15-20 organizations
 hamaare paas aise sanghathan nahin he
 We need to find ways to design our electoral machinery
 hamaari vichaardhaara yaa niti galat nahin he, lekin chunavi mashinari ke bina aap apane khilaaf prachaarit galat baton kaa muqabla kaise karenge?aapane daawa kiya he ki madhya pradesh main aapaki sarkaar ko asthir karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 What are you doing to keep everyone together? How big is the danger from the BJP? The BJP keeps singing it to keep its morale high
 lekin vidhansabha adhyaksh ke chunaav ke samay pehali pariksha saamne ai to ham hi jite
 He then said that the post of deputy speaker goes to the opposition
 maine kaha, aisa nahin hoga
 We went against the convention and held the election and in the result we also won the post of deputy speaker
 isse jaahir hota he ki sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa bhaajapa kaa mansuba puraa nahin ho sakaa

 But he (BJP) is not saying so
 ve kah rahe hai ki in logon ke gharon main chapa padaa or ye baraamad hua
 But they are not telling where the recovery occurred
 mujhe nahin pataa ki un par dabaav he yaa nahin
 But on the issue of transactions, i want to ask the BJP that if they have built an office of one thousand crore rupees in New Delhi, then where did the money come from? He contested the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections due to immense money
 kahaan se aayaa paisa—unki patniyon ke gahane yaa unki sampatti bechney se? pehle ve iskaa jawaab den

 We agreed to bear the brunt of 40 per cent for industries, but what did we do for farmers? The state government can take their debt and if we refuse to repay it, it will turn into non-performing assets (npas) for banks and spoil their balance sheet
 udyogon ke liye jo ve karte hai uskaa das fisadi zyada to krishi ke liye unhen karnaa hi chahie
 Scheduled banks did this
 kya aap aisi kuch nai yojanaon ke bare main bhi soch rahe hai jinase kar kaa boj badaye bina zyada sansaadhan jutaaye ja saken?aisa yojanaayen to kai sari hai lekin samasya unako lagu karne kii he
 i will put an end to those schemes which are not producing the desired results
 pichley mukhyamantri ne ek yojana banaai thi jisamen logon ko 'paidaa hone se lekar marane' tak laabh dene kaa prastaav tha
 Will you review it? We are refining that
 hamen yah sochna he ki ham yojanaon kii delivery kaise sudhaaren taaki unke phaayde labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane ko pakkaa kiya ja sake? iske liye naukarshahi ke ravaiye main bhi badlaav kii jarurat hogi
 The concept of spending the remaining amount in the budget in a hurry needs to be scrapped
 naukarshahi kii baat karen to yah aarope lagaae ja rahe hai ki kai saare tabadale hue or un tabadalon ke liye paison kaa khaasaa lenden hua
 i say the right thing tabadale hue or jari rahenge
 The BJP was in power for 15 years and tried to saffronize government and governance at all levels

 Can Madhya Pradesh be transformed into a major center for agriculture and food processing? maine jo kaam kiye, unamem pehla tha ek mithai parkki sthapana
 This will create employment for about thirty thousand people in Indore
 aakhir hamaare paas madhya pradesh brands kii mithaiyaan kyon nahin honi chahie? rajya main badi maatra main lahasun kii bhi paidaavaar hoti he

 Our decision has nothing to do with politics
 bhaajapa ne koi gaushalaayein nahin banaain, ham ek hajaar bana rahe hai
 The idea came up during the campaigning for the assembly elections
 gaayen sadakon par gum rahi thim, fasalon ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa tha, yatayaat main baadha aa rahi thi, durghatnaayen ho rahi thim

 aap madhya pradesh main kis tarah kii shashan style akhriyaar karenge?ek aisi sarkaar jo sakriy, satark or tej gati vaali ho
 There will also be improvements in the governance process, which i am looking at
 kaam kariye or aage badhie
 Either you agree yourself or you persuade the person in front
 iske alaava koi doosraa tarika nahin he
 Things will not be constant
 ek kendriya mantri hone or ek mukhyamantri hone main kya antar mahasoos kar rahe hai?antar bahut he
 Everything falls in your lap as Chief Minister
 bas durghatana bhi hoti he to mujhase har kism ke sawaal puche jate hai
 When you are a minister at the center, you are limited to the ministry
 rajya main dayera bada hota he, centre main vah sankendrit rahata he
 Can you enjoy being the Chief Minister of the state? i am getting used to it gradually
 kya aapako dilli kii yaad aati he?bamushkil hi dilli jaataa hum

 jab wo party se hatakar patni sunita kapur ko massej karte hue camere main kaid ho gaye
 On this photo of Anil, his daughter Riya Kapoor told Anil, "dad you are the best
" is par anil ke kaha, darling
 
 
 You forgot, very nice addition
 anil kapur ne in tasviir ko old skool romance tag diya he
 Let us know that Anil Kapoor and Sunit are known in Bollywood as the perfect couple
 anil kapur in dinon res 3 kii safalataa ke saath veere di wedding kii kamai kaa jashn manaa rahe hen
 Race 3 has earned 120 crores in 4 days
 tivi kii duniya main do naamon kaa bahut jalawaa he, kamedi ke king kapil sharma or saadagi bhari khubsuurati vaali divyanka treepathi
 But these days both are in a tension
 pehle ye tension kapil ko thi lekin shaadi ke baad se divyanka ke saath bhi aisa hone laga he
 We are talking about TV TRP
 kapil sharmaajab se apane nae sho ke saath aae hai, tabhi se vah ek yaa do baar hi top-5 shoj kii list main shaamil ho sake hai
 At the same time, the first Todiviananka show used to remain first or second in this list continuously for several weeks
 lekin shaadi ke baad se lagata he ki unki popularity bhi kam hoti ja rahi he
 See where Kapil and Divyanka are in the top shows in the Barc ratings from August 27 to September 2: 5-yeh Hai Mohabbatendivyankanke's contesting the show at TRP was tough for the other shows
 vah abhi bhi is list main hai lekin 5wein number par
 Let's see what comes new in this show to come forward in this number game! 4- This show is making its place among the audience for the new concept of realizing power
 haalanki kahani ab bade badlaav ke saath puraane dharre par hi chali gai he
 Now in such a situation, how long this show can keep itself on this position, it will be a matter to be seen! Kapil Sharma received a legal notice
 
 
 3- brahmarakshas : jaag uthaa shaitanjitivi ke is nae sho ne teji se tiarapy batori he
 Its concept is ghostly and Crystal d'souza has made a comeback through it
 'nagin' kaa nayaa luk kya dekha aapane
 
 
 2- Saath Nibhana Sathiagopi and Koki's mother-in-law duo have maintained a special place among the audience
 yah sho lagaataar top-5 main bana hua he
 The special thing is that both rural and urban areas like it
 1-kumkum bhagyabhale hi sho flash back theme par ho lekin maananaa padegaa ki abhi-pragna kii lav story ko lack bahut saport kar rahaa he
 The show has been at the top slot for several weeks and of course Kapil and Divyanka are also in the hope of a similar fate! unhone un maamalon kaa udhaaharan diya jab gambhir mudde chaar yaa paanch nyaayadhishon kii badi peeth ke paas gaye hai
 Justice Katju argues that the BCCI constitution has been prepared under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act and the Supreme Court and the Lodha Committee cannot force the BCCI to change the bye-laws
 unhone kaha, ''ucchtam nyaayalay or lodha samiti donon ne tamilnadu societes registration act kaa ulanghan kiya he
 They have their own memorandum and sub-rules
 agar aapako samvidhan main badlaav karnaa he to do tihaai bahumat se vishesh prastaav paarit kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Society cannot change the bye-laws themselves
 vittiya aniyamittaaon yaa prashasnic kamiyon se shikaayat ho sakati hai, is bare main register of societes ko likhaa janaa chahie
 '' Comments justise katju haalanki sahamat hai ki bisisiai main sudhaar kii jarurat he lekin iske khilaaf unke paas daleel bhi he
 He said, "if we talk about reforms in the BCCI, then there is a need to improve the judiciary as well
 bhartiya adaalaton main teen karod se zyada maamle lambit hai
 If this dangerous process starts, the Supreme Court may also decide on the editorial policies of the press, the tenure of journalists
 yah bhaanumati ke pitare ko khol degaa
 '' (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said, "both the Supreme Court and the Lodha Committee have violated the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act
 unke apane memorondom or up niyam hai
 If you have to change the constitution then a special resolution needs to be passed by a two-thirds majority
 socity swayan up niyamon main badlaav nahin kar sakati
 Complaints with financial irregularities or administrative deficiencies should be written to the Registrar of Societies
 ''tippaniyan Justice Katju, however, agrees that the BCCI needs to be reformed but has a plea against it
 unhone kaha, ''agar ham bisisiai main sudhaar kii baat karte hai to nyaaypalika main bhi sudhaar kii jarurat he
 More than three crore cases are pending in Indian courts
 agar yah khatarnaak prakiya shuru hui to ucchtam nyaayalay press kii sampadakeey nitiyon, patrakaron ke kaarykaal par bhi faisla karne lag saktaa he
 This will open the box of Bhanumati

 Addressing the event, Congress President Rahul Gandhi reminded PM Modi of his government's failure
 vahiin, unhone apni flite main ai takneekee dikkat kaa kissa bhi sunaaya
 Sharing his experience, Rahul also played a new card
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'main do-teen din pehle karnataka ja rahaa tha, main plane main savaar tha
 The plane suddenly came down 8 thousand feet
 main andar se hill gaya or laga ki ab gaadi gai
 That's when i remembered Kailash Mansarovar
 ab main aapse 10 se 15 din ke liye chuttee chahta hum taaki kailash maansarovar kii yatra par ja sakuun
 'rahul Gandhi's statement is considered to be very important from the electoral point of view
 saath hi congress kii soft hindutv kii chhavi se bhi ise jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Actually, there are many reasons behind this
 2014 main centre kii satta main purna bahumat se ai bijepi congress par hindu virdohi party hone ke aarope lagaati rahi he
 The Congress has been losing election-by-election for some time, the Congress has also tried its best to weaken the allegations of the opponents and change its image
 jisaki baangi sabase pehle gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main dekhne ko mili
 During the election campaign in Gujarat, when Rahul Gandhi gave prominence to the temple philosophy, there was a discussion of the soft Hindutva image of the Congress everywhere
 congress party or khud rahul gandhi saarvajanik manch se khud ke pakke hindu hone ke daawey karte rahe
 Even Rahul told himself to Janeudhari
 gujarat ke baad ab karnataka main bhi rahul gandhi or congress netaa mathon ke jamkar daure kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has visited monasteries and temples associated with Lingayat, Vokkaligga and Qurba communities in the state
 wo aksar maathe par tikaa lagaae, mandiron main puja karte hue, pujaariyon se aashirwad lete hue najar aate hai
 In this episode, when Rahul narrated the incident of problem in his plane on his way to Karnataka, he played a big card here too
 rahul ne kaha ki jab unhen laga ki ab gaadi gai (shaayad antim vakt aa gaya he) to unhenkailash maansarovarki yaad ai
 Saying this, Rahul announced to go on a Kailash Mansarovar Yatra after the Karnataka elections
 ek taraf rahul ne jahaan saarvajanik taur par khud kailash maansarovar yatra par jane kii ghoshnaa kii, vahiin duusari taraf 1 may se karnataka main chunaav prachaar ke liye utar rahe pradhanmantri narendra modi apane prastaavit kaarykram ke baavjood baba kedaar ke darshan ke liye nahin ja paae
 The doors of Baba Kedarnath are open on Sunday and PM Modi was supposed to go to Kedarnath on this occasion, but his program was canceled
 to ab jabaki sabhi partiyanmishan 2019main juty hui hai
 In such a situation, the Congress, which is standing on the margins in electoral politics, is also seen moving every possible bet for the comeback
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi bijepi ko usee ke andaaj main gherne kii har tarkeeb apanaate dikh rahe hai
 However, what effect this entire exercise will have on the election results, only time will tell
 bataa den ki kailash maansarovar kii yatra hindu dharm kii sabase kathin yatra maani jaati he
 In such a situation, going on this journey of Congress President Rahul Gandhi is being seen as a big message

 At present, the police are scouring the place in search of Guddu Yadav and other accused involved in the incident

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) tmc's performance against the central government on the issue of NRC: Mamata, a refugee from Bangladesh, is a statewide protest of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) against the central government in West Bengal today
 neshnal register of citigen (enarasi) ke virodh main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii aguwai main party ke netaa pradarshan karenge
 Earlier Mamata Banerjee had said that due to NRC there is an atmosphere of fear in Bengal
 mamata is silsile main pradhanmantri narendra modi or kendriya grahamantri amit shah se bhi mulaakaat kar chuki hai
 tmc's campaign against NRC: Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee on Thursday advised her party leaders to carry out a massive campaign against NRC, saying the Trinamool Congress does not support discrimination on the basis of caste or religion
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa naam liye bina mamata banerjee ne kaha, kuch log kah rahe hai ki bangladesh se bharat main sharan lene waalon konaagarikta sanshodhan vidheyakamein sanshodhan ke baad naagarikta di jaaegi
 The NRC of Bengal became an issue in West Bengal
 The Chief Minister of West Bengal said, "it should be remembered that the people who came as refugees from East Bengal (now Bangladesh) are citizens of our country
 banerjee ne kaha ki kisi ko kitni baar apni naagarikta sabit kerani hogi or kitne pahchaan patr hasil karne honge
 Both Trinamool Congress and BJP have made NRC an issue in West Bengal
 chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav kareeb aate hi ipies afasaron ke baad ab iees afasaron par bhi siyaasi rang chadhane laga he
 The latest case is that of Raipur Collector OP Chaudhary
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 2005 batch ke is iees afasar ne naukari chhod bijepi kaa daaman thaamne kaa faisla kiya he
 If all goes well, OP Chaudhary may be bjp's candidate from Kharsia seat in Raigad district
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi main pravesh ke liye unki do baar party adhyakshmit shahase mulaakaat ho chuki he
 Significantly, the name of OP Chaudhary as an IAS officer has topped the Chief Minister Raman Singh's Good Book
 jiske do kaaran bataae jate hai, pehla yah ki ve chhattisgarh ke raigarh jile ke byang gaanv ke rahane vaale hai or unhone chhattisgarh main hi kaary karne kii ichha jaahir kar apana mul cader is pradesh ko chunaa
 Secondly, while being the Collector in Dantewada, he transformed the Naxalite affected area into an education hub, due to which the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh awarded him the Prime Minister Excellence Award in the year 2011-12
 dantewada ke baad jansampark mahakme main bataur ayukta or raipur main colector rahete hue unhone sarkari yojanaon ko lagu karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Due to this, Chief Minister Raman Singh was greatly influenced by Collector OP Chaudhary
 raigarh kii kharsia seat par bijepi ne kabhi bhi jeet nahin darj kii
 Despite the Atal wave or the Modi wave, the BJP had to face this seat in the last assembly elections
 sanyukt madhyapradesh ke dauraan se kharsia vidhansabha seat par congress kaa kabja rahaa
 Kharsia was the traditional seat of late Congress leader Nand Kumar Patel
 pichley vidhaan sabha chunaav ke pehle 25 may 2012 ko bastar kii jheram ghati main hue naksali hamale main nand kumaar patel kii maut ho gai thi
 His son Umesh Patel won this seat in the by-election held after his death
 kharsia vidhansabha, agasia samudaay bahulya seat he, jiske baad vaisya samudaay ke sarvaadhik voter hai
 OP Chaudhary also comes from the Agassia community
 bataa den ki opi choudhary is ilaake se pehle noujvaan hai jinhone civil seva pariksha main baaji maari
 In this sense, OP Chaudhary's name is famous in every village
 colector banane ke baad to unki khyaati aisi faili ki ilaake ke kai naujaavan unhen apana adarsh maanate hai
 In his hometown, OP Chaudhary also organized several camps to prepare for competitive examinations
 in shiviron main badi taadaad main yuva chaatr chaatraon ne UPSC kii koching lee
 Due to which his inclination towards OP Chaudhary increased
 philhal opi choudhary iees se istipha dene kii taiyaari main hai
 But before contesting elections, he is not opening his card for admission in BJP
 is bare main jab unase poocha gaya to unhone naukari se istife or raajnneetik dal main shaamil hone ke sawaal ko hi taal diya
 It was clear from his talk that until the BJP high command gets his ticket promise, he will not make public his political will
 philhal atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki vidhaan sabha chunaav main wo kharsia vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar honge
 a report submitted to the Home Ministry in the month of September this year is going to raise concerns

 View this post on instagramday 11 - Happiness galore with no sleep, colic and feeding round the clock ! i think i forgot how stressful breastfeeding can be !! i mean the pressure Is quite real and the whole top feed balance after a csec is hectic! i finally am exclusively feeding her but the whole process is something that should be natural but it’s made to be very stressful 
 i realised with the feedback that a lot of women struggle with it
 i think it’s cool if a mom wants to move totally to formula or only BF or balance both 
 There is no shame and no one can define what's the perfect way

 Team India's journey in the ICC World Cup-2019 has ended
 semifinal mukaable main newjiland se mili shikast ke baad bhartiya cricket control board (BCCI) ection mod main aa gaya he
 First BCCI has targeted assistant coach Sanjay Bangar
 ieenes ke mutabik, bhartiya cricket team ke mukhya coach ravi shastri samet anya koching staff ke qaraar ko world cap ke baad 45 dinon ke liye badhaayaa ja saktaa he, lekin sahaayak coach sanjay bangar kii jagah sunishchit nahin he kyonki BCCI ke ek mukhya dhade kaa maananaa he ki unhen apana kaam behatar tareeke se karnaa chahie tha
 a batsman who could not find for the number-4 is Bangar as an assistant coach as well as the batting coach of the team
 bowling coach bharat arun or fielding coach aar shridhar ne pichley dedh saal main shandaar kaam kiya he, lekin bangar ke bare main aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki kai baar team kii ballebaaji juujhati dikhi he
 Not being able to pick a strong batsman at the number-4 position, BCCI has also gone through the trap
 bangar ne vijay shankar ko feet bataaya thabisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ne ieenes se kaha, 'yah lagaataar pareshaani kaa vishay rahaa
 We are giving full support to the players as they played poorly in only one match (against New Zealand), but the staff process and decision will be examined and their future will be decided
 ' vijay shankar ke chotil hokar toornament se baahar hone se pehle bangar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhartiya olerounder puri tarah se feet he
 The players, who used to take the help of former batsmen, said, "it was a simple thing for Bangar to say that the all-rounder was fully fit before Shankar was ruled out of the tournament due to injury

 The question that again arose on the team manager is that the conduct of team manager Sunil Subramaniam during the tournament also surprised some officials of the board

 According to the historian M
 Malik, who is associated with Maharishi Dayanand University, the incident begins on April 18, 1930, when the freedom fighters in Chittagong, Bengal formed the Indian Republican Army (IRA) to overthrow the British
 iaare ke gathan se puure bengal main kranti kii jwaala bhadak uthi or 18 april 1930 ko suryasen ke netritv main darjanon krantikariyon ne chatgaanv ke shastraagaar ko lootakar angrej shashan ke khatme kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Due to the flame of revolution, the representatives of the rulers fled by pressing the tail and British rule came to an end in Chittagong for a few days

 The impact of this incident lasted for several months

 one rupee more than the minimum wage
 aapane banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay kaa bhi haal dekha, imaarat shandaar he, itihaas shandaar he magar vartanaam sharmasaar he
 The problem is that those who have nothing to do with Sanskrit are raising slogans of Sanskrit
 jinka sanskrit se sambandh he, unke naaron ko koi sunne vaala nahin he
 The students of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University hoped that there would be some impact after the issue arose in prime time
 prashasan ko laga tha ki ham story karke bhul gaye hai lekin jab ajay singh dobaaraa gaye to uske baad karmchaaree union ke netaa ko kulapati ne kaha he ki fund kii vyavastha ho gai he, vetan mil jayega
 But the problem is not just salary
 adhyaaapak kii kami or padhai kii maang ko is vakt puure bharat kaa yah akelaa andolan he
 After 10 days, these students got their shaving done
 vyavastha kaa shraadh karm kar daalaa
 The systems do not panic with such Shraddha Karma
 unhen pataa he ki kai dashakon se ve lakhon chaatro kaa mundan kar chuki hai, chaatro ke mundan karne se kuch nahin hoga
 Even after being the prime minister's field, the teacher kept getting reinstated so soon
 aajkal sabake paas ek hi redimaid formula he, theke par teacher le aaen, aadhi selary main kaam karaao
 The sanctity of the chanting of mantras was taken care of by the students while pitting the VC
 karmchaaree union ne bhi apane andolan ko lila main badalte rahe
 Sometimes polished the boot and sometimes sold tea
 chaay bechnaa ab pratirodh kaa pratik ban chukaa he kyonki iskaa sambandh pradhanmantri ke ateet se he
 The news of employees getting salary came later, when Ajay Singh went to talk to the Vice Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, he was full of this confidence
 sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke visi ko bhi lagata he ki dharna dene vaale bahari hai
 Nowadays democracy of India seems to be running external
 system ke bheetar baithe logon ko sawaal karne vaale har bhartiya main ek bahari dikh rahaa he
 Apart from Ajay Singh, Karuna reached Indus Devi Prasad Sanskrit College, Ballia
 yah kalege sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity se hi judaa hua he
 There is nothing on the ground, the college runs on the first floor
 pratham tal par ek hi kamare kaa aphis he
 Classes are going on in the Teen Shed on the second floor
 garmi main tin shed ke neeche dadhakati agni jwaala ke bich yahaan ke 150 chaatr sanskrit padhakar visham paristhitiyon main jeene kaa jo kirtiman banaate hai wo acolpaneey he
 The broken chairs here are telling that at some time some avatar man will come, who will get welfare of them if they get tired of asking for votes
 koi na bhi kare to in kursiyon ko pataa he ki sanskrit kii tarah ve bhi kai sadiyon tak tuuti hui padi rah sakati hai
 If 150 students who have had the privilege of studying in this Agni Kund, would not have had any name for Sanskrit education today
 unki garibi is vishay tak le ai he
 There is only one teacher who is also the acting principal
 of record pataa chalaa ki kalege kii puraani building hai, magar vahaan privet skool chalata he
 Those who are teachers do not get salary at the right time
 baliya shahar ko ek or sanskrit kalege praapt hone kaa gaurav hasil he
 Its name is Jubilee Sanskrit College
 yahaan do chaatr padhai kar rahe hai
 The roof of this college can fall anytime without any prior notice
 itnaa kaaphi he ki girane se pehle aap daraaren dekh sakate hai
 The entire plaster of a room in sociology has fallen
 padhaane ke liye 150 chaatro par do adhyaaapak hai jo bina 7-8 maheene se vetan na milane par bhi adhyaaapak hone kii garima chhod nahin paa rahe hai
 You must be wondering what would be the benefit of seeing the condition of colleges one after the other
 inhen dekhnaa isliye zaruri he ki taaki aapkaa bhram toote
 You change lakhs of cities, change colleges, increase the cost of education, you will face this crisis everywhere
 kharaab collejon ke kaaran bharat main har doosraa aadmi shahar badal rahaa he
 Ballia is going to Benaras, Benaras is going to Lucknow, Lucknow is going to Delhi
 gum phir kar baliya aa ja rahaa he
 Indresh Pandey from Mirzapur has sent this report
 sanyukt sanskrit mahavidhyalay, yahaan par aathvin se lekar eme tak kii padhai ke liye sirf ek adhyaaapak he
 The college is open to waste 203 students
 inderesh ko kalege main bie or eme ke ek bhi chaatr nahin mili
 Why did he come, when he knows that a bullet train will arrive in India, but if there is no teacher in his college, then what is the benefit of going? 10veen class ke bachche mobile phone ke zarie smart india, digital india se conect hone kaa abhyaas kar rahe hai
 As soon as he saw the camera, it was as if he had seen Guruji, so in the mobile pocket, shlokas started to be chanted
 college ke principal kaa cameraa bataa rahaa he ki iskaa bhavishya gauravshaalee ho hi nahin saktaa
 One thing was heard in many places
 sanskrit padhane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr garib hai
 If you cannot study anything else due to economic weakness, then you come to study Sanskrit, where the college of Sanskrit teaches them to remain poor for life
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit main gyaan kaa nirmaan kam ho rahaa he
 Its practicality for ritual needs has ceased
 garibi na hoti to sanskrit padhane vaala koi chaatr nahin hota
 i did not know that India's poverty takes care of Sanskrit so much
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne sanskrit kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye 1970 se rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaaya he
 Its headquarter is running in Delhi's Janakpuri
 aap is santhaan kii tasveeron ko dekhte chaliye, ham isi bahaane iskaa itihaas or vartmaan bataate hai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is the high center of Sanskrit education in India
 1956-57 main pratham sanskrit ayog bana tha jiske suzav par rashtriya sanskrit santhaan kii sthapana hui thi
 National Sanskrit Sansthan is the top nodal agency in India or outside India
 may, 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne ise dimd uniwarsity kaa darja de diya
 Murali Manohan Joshi was then the Minister of Human Resources
 iske pehle tak rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke jaipur, puri or singery main campus hua karata tha
 The Singeri campus was inaugurated by Rajiv Gandhi
 iske zyaadaatar campus 1997 ke pehle ke bane hue hai
 The condition of all the campus looks good in the pictures
 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses
 40 se 50 fisadi shikshak nahin he
 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract
 jinamein se kai 15-15 saal se theke par padhaa rahe hai
 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work
 jab shikshak hi apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit hai to vah sanskrit kii asuraksha kaise dur karegaa
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
 unke liye yah samasya saamaanya baat he or ise bhagwaan hi thik kar sakate hai
 The National Sanskrit Sansthan campuses are in Jammu, Allahabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Himachal Pradesh, Sringeri, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guruvayur, Puri and Agartala
 ye sanskrit kaa nayaa idara he magar yah bhi sanskrit ko aage nahin le sakaa
 The Jaipur campus has been in existence since 1983
 kul 900 chaatr hai or kareeb sau chaatr piechdi kar rahe hai
 a new diploma course combining Yoga and Ayurveda has also been launched here
 yahaan ke principal kaa kahana he ki is santhaan main shikshakon kii kami he magar lagan kii nahin
 He told that twenty students have passed the examination of Rajasthan Public Service Commission from their campus this year
 sanskrit se
 But everyone has compromised on teaching on contract, that is, half salary
 agar theke par rakhe gaye in shikshakon ke chaatr itnaa acha kar rahe hai, phir to unhen permanent kiya hi janaa chahie
 There are 34 permanent teachers and 37 on contract
 pareshaani aati he jahaan vishmata kaa bhav paidaa hota he usee kaa saathi utani hi yogyata rakhane vaala ek pe scale achchhakhaasa tankhwaah paa rahaa he
 The benefit of the pay commissions is getting the benefit of DA, on the other hand the person with the same qualifications is working on a certain amount of the same amount of labor, so you think that the design of human mind
 uske man main apane hi saathi, jo samaan kaary karne vaala he, ke prati kisi tarah kaa achachhaa bhav banegaa? prashasan ke upar acha bhav banegaa? vah chahega ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaae
 The courts are helping in this as happened in Himachal
 rashtriya sanskrit shiksha santhaan ke paas sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye puraa charter he
 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities
 aadhunik vishyon ko shuru karne ke liye vishesh rup se grant diya jaae
 Sanskrit atmosphere should be created in the campus
 saadhaaran sanskrit main shastron kii padhai ho
 Like Tamil, Hindi, Urdu University, subjects like history, social science, science and commerce should be taught
 biessi, emessi jaise course sanskrit main bhi bane
 All these improvements are given about Indian languages to create employment opportunities in them
 is baar ke bajet main hindi nideshaalay ke liye 46 karod die jane kaa prastaav to dikhaa he, sanskrit ke liye alag se grant kii ghoshnaa nazar nahin ai
 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he
 There is nothing on what will happen to the lands or resources of the colleges which have been closed or are on the verge of closure
 arya gurukul sanskrit mahavidhyalay khandhar main badal chukaa he
 Seeing which corner of this building you would like to say hi-hi, kitchen or guesthouse or toilet
 rahane dijie
 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 This is the only movement in the whole of India at the moment to address the shortage of teachers and demand for education
 10 din baad in chaatro ne apana mundan kara liya
 Shraddha of the system was done
 vyavasthaaen aise shraadh karm se nahin ghabraati hai
 They know that for many decades they have shaved millions of students, nothing will happen if the students are shaved
 pradhanmantri kaa kshetra hone ke baad bhi itani jaldi shikshak behaal hone se rahe
 Nowadays everyone has the same readymade formula, get the teacher on contract, get half the salary done
 chaatro ne visi kaa pindadaan karte samay mantron ke uccharan kii pavitrataa kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 The employees union also kept changing its movement in Leela
 kabhi boot paalish karte rahe to kabhi chaay bechate rahe
 Selling tea has now become a symbol of resistance as it relates to the Prime Minister's past
 karmchaariyon ko vetan milane kii khabar baad main ai he, usase pehle jab ajay singh sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar se baat karne gaye to ve is aatmavishvaas se bhare dikhe
 The VC of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University also feels that the sit-ins are outsiders
 aajkal bharat kaa loktantr lagata he bahari chalaa rahe hai
 Every Indian questioning those sitting within the system has an outsider look
 ajay singh ke alaava karunaa sindhu pahunche baliya ke devi prasad sanskrit mahavidhyalay
 This college is associated with Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
 zamin par kuch bhi nahin he, college pratham tal par hi chalata he
 There is only one room office on the first floor
 dwitiya tal par tin shed main kakshaen chal rahi hai
 The record that 150 students of Sanskrit read Sanskrit to live in odd conditions in the midst of the blazing fire under the tin shed in summer is unimaginable
 yahaan kii tuuti hui kursiyaan bataa rahi hai ki kabhi na kabhi koi avatar purush aayega jo vot maangane se thak jane par inkaa kalyaan karegaa
 If no one does, then these chairs know that like Sanskrit, they too can remain broken for many centuries
 jin 150 chaatro ko is agni kunda main padhane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua he, ve na hote to aaj sanskrit shiksha kaa koi naam leva na hota
 Their poverty has brought this subject
 yahaan ek hi adhyaaapak hai jo kaaryvahak principal bhi hai
 Off records show that the college has an old building, but a private school runs there
 jo adhyaaapak hai unhen sahi samay par vetan nahin miltaa he
 The city of Ballia has the distinction of receiving another Sanskrit college
 iskaa naam jubilee sanskrit college he
 Two students are studying here
 is college kii chat bagair kisi purv soochna ke kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 So much so that you can see cracks before falling
 samajashaastra ke ek kamare kaa puraa plaster gir chukaa he
 There are two teachers for teaching 150 students, who are not able to give up the dignity of being teachers even if they do not get salary for 7-8 months
 aap sochate honge ki ek ke baad ek collejon kii haalat dekhakar kya laabh hoga
 It is important to watch them so that your confusion is broken
 aap lakh shahar badal den, college badal len, padhai kaa karcha badha den, har jagah isi sankat se aapkaa saamana hoga
 Every other man city in India is changing due to poor colleges
 baliya vaala banaras aa rahaa he, banaras vaala lakhanu ja rahaa he, lakhanu vaala dilli ja rahaa he
 Ballia is coming around again
 mirzapur se inderesh pandey ne yah report bheji he
 The Joint Sanskrit College has only one teacher for studying from VIII to MA
 203 chaatro ko barbaad karne ke liye yah kalege khulaa hua he
 Indresh found no BA and MA students in the college
 wo aae bhi kyon, jab pataa he ki bharat main bullate train aa jaaegi magar unke college main teacher nahin aayega, to jane se kya laabh
 Class 10 children are practicing to connect with Smart India, Digital India through mobile phones
 camere ko dekhte hi laga ki jaise guruji ko dekh liya, lihaaza mobile jeb main rakh shloke ratane lage
 The college principal's room is telling that its future cannot be glorious
 kai jagahon par ek baat sunai di
 Most of the students studying Sanskrit are poor
 aarthik kamazori ke kaaran kuch or nahin pard sakate to sanskrit padhane aa jate hai, jahaan sanskrit kaa college unhen aaajeevan garib bane rahane kii shiksha detaa he
 This is why the creation of knowledge in Sanskrit is decreasing
 karmkand kii zaruuraton ke liye isaki vyaavhaarikta rah gai he
 If there was no poverty, there would be no student studying Sanskrit
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki bharat kii garibi sanskrit kaa itnaa khyaal rakhti he
 By the way, the Government of India has created the National Institute of Sanskrit since 1970 to take care of Sanskrit
 jiskaa mukhyalay dilli ke janakapuri main chal rahaa he
 If you look at the pictures of this institution, we tell its history and present on this excuse
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan bharat main sanskrit shiksha kaa ucch kend he
 In 1956-57, the first Sanskrit Commission was formed on the suggestion of which the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan was established
 bharat yaa bharat ke baahar rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sheersh nodel agency he
 In May 2002, the Vajpayee government gave it the status of deemed university

 Why did he come, when he knows that a bullet train will arrive in India, but if there is no teacher in his college, then what is the benefit of going? 10veen class ke bachche mobile phone ke zarie smart india, digital india se conect hone kaa abhyaas kar rahe hai
 As soon as he saw the camera, it was as if he had seen Guruji, so in the mobile pocket, shlokas started to be chanted
 college ke principal kaa cameraa bataa rahaa he ki iskaa bhavishya gauravshaalee ho hi nahin saktaa
 One thing was heard in many places
 sanskrit padhane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr garib hai
 If you cannot study anything else due to economic weakness, then you come to study Sanskrit, where the college of Sanskrit teaches them to remain poor for life
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit main gyaan kaa nirmaan kam ho rahaa he
 Its practicality for ritual needs has ceased
 garibi na hoti to sanskrit padhane vaala koi chaatr nahin hota
 i did not know that India's poverty takes care of Sanskrit so much
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne sanskrit kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye 1970 se rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaaya he
 Its headquarter is running in Delhi's Janakpuri
 aap is santhaan kii tasveeron ko dekhte chaliye, ham isi bahaane iskaa itihaas or vartmaan bataate hai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is the high center of Sanskrit education in India
 1956-57 main pratham sanskrit ayog bana tha jiske suzav par rashtriya sanskrit santhaan kii sthapana hui thi
 National Sanskrit Sansthan is the top nodal agency in India or outside India
 may, 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne ise dimd uniwarsity kaa darja de diya
 Murali Manohan Joshi was then the Minister of Human Resources
 iske pehle tak rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke jaipur, puri or singery main campus hua karata tha
 The Singeri campus was inaugurated by Rajiv Gandhi
 iske zyaadaatar campus 1997 ke pehle ke bane hue hai
 The condition of all the campus looks good in the pictures
 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses
 40 se 50 fisadi shikshak nahin he
 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract
 jinamein se kai 15-15 saal se theke par padhaa rahe hai
 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work
 jab shikshak hi apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit hai to vah sanskrit kii asuraksha kaise dur karegaa
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
 unke liye yah samasya saamaanya baat he or ise bhagwaan hi thik kar sakate hai
 The National Sanskrit Sansthan campuses are in Jammu, Allahabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Himachal Pradesh, Sringeri, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guruvayur, Puri and Agartala
 ye sanskrit kaa nayaa idara he magar yah bhi sanskrit ko aage nahin le sakaa
 The Jaipur campus has been in existence since 1983
 kul 900 chaatr hai or kareeb sau chaatr piechdi kar rahe hai
 a new diploma course combining Yoga and Ayurveda has also been launched here
 yahaan ke principal kaa kahana he ki is santhaan main shikshakon kii kami he magar lagan kii nahin
 He told that twenty students have passed the examination of Rajasthan Public Service Commission from their campus this year
 sanskrit se
 But everyone has compromised on teaching on contract, that is, half salary
 agar theke par rakhe gaye in shikshakon ke chaatr itnaa acha kar rahe hai, phir to unhen permanent kiya hi janaa chahie
 There are 34 permanent teachers and 37 on contract
 pareshaani aati he jahaan vishmata kaa bhav paidaa hota he usee kaa saathi utani hi yogyata rakhane vaala ek pe scale achchhakhaasa tankhwaah paa rahaa he
 The benefit of the pay commissions is getting the benefit of DA, on the other hand the person with the same qualifications is working on a certain amount of the same amount of labor, so you think that the design of human mind
 uske man main apane hi saathi, jo samaan kaary karne vaala he, ke prati kisi tarah kaa achachhaa bhav banegaa? prashasan ke upar acha bhav banegaa? vah chahega ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaae
 The courts are helping in this as happened in Himachal
 rashtriya sanskrit shiksha santhaan ke paas sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye puraa charter he
 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities
 aadhunik vishyon ko shuru karne ke liye vishesh rup se grant diya jaae
 Sanskrit atmosphere should be created in the campus
 saadhaaran sanskrit main shastron kii padhai ho
 Like Tamil, Hindi, Urdu University, subjects like history, social science, science and commerce should be taught
 biessi, emessi jaise course sanskrit main bhi bane
 All these improvements are given about Indian languages to create employment opportunities in them
 is baar ke bajet main hindi nideshaalay ke liye 46 karod die jane kaa prastaav to dikhaa he, sanskrit ke liye alag se grant kii ghoshnaa nazar nahin ai
 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he
 There is nothing on what will happen to the lands or resources of the colleges which have been closed or are on the verge of closure
 arya gurukul sanskrit mahavidhyalay khandhar main badal chukaa he
 Seeing which corner of this building you would like to say hi-hi, kitchen or guesthouse or toilet
 rahane dijie
 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 You must be wondering what would be the benefit of seeing the condition of colleges one after the other
 inhen dekhnaa isliye zaruri he ki taaki aapkaa bhram toote
 You change lakhs of cities, change colleges, increase the cost of education, you will face this crisis everywhere
 kharaab collejon ke kaaran bharat main har doosraa aadmi shahar badal rahaa he
 Ballia is going to Benaras, Benaras is going to Lucknow, Lucknow is going to Delhi
 gum phir kar baliya aa ja rahaa he
 Indresh Pandey from Mirzapur has sent this report

 rashtriya sanskrit shiksha santhaan ke paas sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye puraa charter he
 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities
 aadhunik vishyon ko shuru karne ke liye vishesh rup se grant diya jaae
 Sanskrit atmosphere should be created in the campus
 saadhaaran sanskrit main shastron kii padhai ho
 Like Tamil, Hindi, Urdu University, subjects like history, social science, science and commerce should be taught
 biessi, emessi jaise course sanskrit main bhi bane
 All these improvements are given about Indian languages to create employment opportunities in them
 is baar ke bajet main hindi nideshaalay ke liye 46 karod die jane kaa prastaav to dikhaa he, sanskrit ke liye alag se grant kii ghoshnaa nazar nahin ai
 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he
 There is nothing on what will happen to the lands or resources of the colleges which have been closed or are on the verge of closure
 arya gurukul sanskrit mahavidhyalay khandhar main badal chukaa he
 Seeing which corner of this building you would like to say hi-hi, kitchen or guesthouse or toilet

 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 By the way, the Government of India has created the National Institute of Sanskrit since 1970 to take care of Sanskrit
 jiskaa mukhyalay dilli ke janakapuri main chal rahaa he
 If you look at the pictures of this institution, we tell its history and present on this excuse
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan bharat main sanskrit shiksha kaa ucch kend he
 In 1956-57, the first Sanskrit Commission was formed on the suggestion of which the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan was established
 bharat yaa bharat ke baahar rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sheersh nodel agency he
 In May 2002, the Vajpayee government gave it the status of deemed university
 murali manohan joshi tab maanav sansaadhan mantri hua karte the
 Earlier, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan had campuses in Jaipur, Puri and Singeri
 singery campus kaa udghaatan rajeev gandhi ne kiya tha
 Most of its campuses date back to 1997
 tasveeron main sabhi campus kii haalat acchhee dikhti he
 In 2012, the World Sanskrit Conference was held in Delhi
 isamen tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ko antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay ke str kaa banane kii baat kahi thi
 No one knows what happened to that goal
 usee samay sanskrit kii samasyaon or sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karne ke liye sanskrit ayog ke gathan kii baat hui thi jise do saal baad 10 janvari, 2014 ko puraa kar diya gaya
 On 9 January 2015, the term of the Second Sanskrit Commission came to an end
 iske chairman sanskrit bhashaa main gyanpith puraskaar praapt professor satyavrath shastri banaae gaye the
 On December 17, 2015, Ann
 gopal swami ke netritv main ek panel bana, jisane 32 pej kii report teen maheene main saunp di gai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan operates directly from the Ministry of Human Resources
 iske tamaam campus main
 40 to 50 percent are not teachers
 inaki jagah kareeb 200 shikshak theke par padhaa rahe hai
 Many of whom have been teaching on contract for 15-15 years
 ve theke par padhaane ke liye to yogya maane jate hai magar permanent karne ke liye nahin
 When the teacher is insecure about his future, how will he overcome the insecurity of Sanskrit
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati se susheel mahapatra ne baat kii
 This problem is normal for them and only God can fix it
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke campus jammu, elahabaad, dilli, mumbai, bhopal, himachal pradesh, shringery, jaipur, lakhanu, guruvayur, puri or agartalla main main hai
 This is the new Idara of Sanskrit but it also could not take Sanskrit further
 jaipur campus 1983 se hi kaayam he
 There are 900 students in total and around a hundred students are doing phd
 yahaan par yoga or ayurveda ko milakar ek nayaa diploma course bhi laanch kiya gaya he
 The principal here says that there is a shortage of teachers in this institute but not of dedication
 unhone bataaya ki unke campus se rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kii pariksha main is saal bees chaatro ne paas kiya he
 From Sanskrit
 magar sabane kantrect par yani aadhi tankhwaah par padhaane se samjhauta kar liya he
 If the students of these contractual teachers are doing so well, then they must be managed
 yahaan 34 permanent shikshak hai or 37 kantrect par
 Trouble arises where a sense of asymmetry arises, the partner of the same is earning a decent salary on a pay scale having equal merit
 vetan aayogon kaa laabh paa rahaa he die kaa laabh paa rahaa he, duusari taraf utani hi yogyata vaala vyakti utana hi shram vaala vyakti ek nishchit raashi par kaam kar rahaa he, to aap sochie ki manushya ke man kii banaavat
 Will there be any kind of good feeling in his mind towards his own partner, who is going to do the same thing? Will a good attitude prevail over the administration? He would like to become permanent
 court isamen sahaayak ho rahe hai jaisaa himachal main hua
 The National Institute of Sanskrit Education has a full charter for the development of Sanskrit
 iske baad bhi sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye doosraa sanskrit ayog bana, jisaki report endie ke samay jamaa hui he
 The report of the new chairman says that outright grants should be given for new Sanskrit universities in different states
 sabhi sanskrit uniwarsity main skill deveopment ke course ke liye grant diya jaae
 Special grants should be given to start modern subjects
 campus main sanskrit kaa vaataavaran banaaya jaae
 The scriptures should be studied in ordinary Sanskrit
 tamil, hindi, urdu uniwarsity kii tarah itihaas, samaaj vigyaan, vigyaan or vaanijya jaise vishay padhaaye jaaen
 Courses like b
sc, m
sc were also made in Sanskrit
 yahi saare sudhav bhartiya bhashaaon ke bare main die jate hai ki unamem rojgaar kii sambhaavna paidaa karo
 In this budget, a proposal to give 46 crores for the Hindi Directorate has been shown, but the announcement of a separate grant for Sanskrit was not visible
 lagata he ki duusare sanskrit ayog kii report ko gambhirtha se liya hi nahin gaya he
 If you know what will happen to this Sanskrit college in Sirsaganj town of Firozabad, UP, there is nothing in the Sanskrit Commission
 jo college band ho chuke hai yaa band hone ke kagaar par hai, unki zameenon yaa sansadhano kaa kya hoga, is par bhi kuch nahin he
 Arya Gurukul Sanskrit College has turned into ruins
 is imaarat kaa koun sa konaa dekhakar aap hai-hai karnaa chahenge, rasoi ghar yaa guestaouse yaa shauchalay

 bharat ko vishwa guru bananaa he, ye naaraa japate rahiye, usee se sab thik ho jayega
 There used to be around 300 students till the 80s, at present there are only 7 students
 inke liye ek shikshak hai jinka vetan sarkaar bhejti he or teen karmchaaree bhi hai
 One teacher for seven students
 lagata he ki koi dekhne vaala nahin ki sarkaar ke sansadhano kaa kaise behatar istemaal kiya jaae
 In 1978, the founder of the institute was killed in a land dispute
 tippaniyan These useless resources could also be used in the development of Sanskrit, but it is necessary for it to work
 puri loksabhaa se bijedy saansad pinaki mishra ne poocha tha ki naukari ke avasaron kii kami ke kaaran pichley das varshon main sanskrit padhaane vaale adhyapakon kii sankhya main bahut kami ai he, kya yah sahi he
 Has the number of Sanskrit students decreased
 17 july, 2017 ko jawaab dete hue maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri doctor mahend nath pandeya ne kaha ki mantralay skulon or collejon main sanskrit padhaane vaale shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin rakhata he
 According to available information, there has been no decrease in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke paas jab shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin he to phir kya he
 Nevertheless, the Minister is saying that there has been no reduction in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 hamane kai jagah dekha ki sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 There has also been a decrease in students
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit universti main bhi sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 The Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan also believes that the teachers are few
 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses
 40 se 50 fisadi shikshak nahin he
 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract
 jinamein se kai 15-15 saal se theke par padhaa rahe hai
 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work
 jab shikshak hi apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit hai to vah sanskrit kii asuraksha kaise dur karegaa
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
 unke liye yah samasya saamaanya baat he or ise bhagwaan hi thik kar sakate hai
 The National Sanskrit Sansthan campuses are in Jammu, Allahabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Himachal Pradesh, Sringeri, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guruvayur, Puri and Agartala
 ye sanskrit kaa nayaa idara he magar yah bhi sanskrit ko aage nahin le sakaa
 The Jaipur campus has been in existence since 1983
 kul 900 chaatr hai or kareeb sau chaatr piechdi kar rahe hai
 a new diploma course combining Yoga and Ayurveda has also been launched here
 yahaan ke principal kaa kahana he ki is santhaan main shikshakon kii kami he magar lagan kii nahin
 He told that twenty students have passed the examination of Rajasthan Public Service Commission from their campus this year
 sanskrit se
 But everyone has compromised on teaching on contract, that is, half salary
 agar theke par rakhe gaye in shikshakon ke chaatr itnaa acha kar rahe hai, phir to unhen permanent kiya hi janaa chahie
 There are 34 permanent teachers and 37 on contract
 pareshaani aati he jahaan vishmata kaa bhav paidaa hota he usee kaa saathi utani hi yogyata rakhane vaala ek pe scale achchhakhaasa tankhwaah paa rahaa he
 The benefit of the pay commissions is getting the benefit of DA, on the other hand the person with the same qualifications is working on a certain amount of the same amount of labor, so you think that the design of human mind
 uske man main apane hi saathi, jo samaan kaary karne vaala he, ke prati kisi tarah kaa achachhaa bhav banegaa? prashasan ke upar acha bhav banegaa? vah chahega ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaae
