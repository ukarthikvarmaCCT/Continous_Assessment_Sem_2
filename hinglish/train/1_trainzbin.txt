 In Surat on Wednesday, there will be an auction of a suit worn by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the visit of US President Barack Obama to India
 vahiin, congress ne is suut kii nilaamee par modi ko gherne kii puri taiyaari kar lee he
 The Congress said, 'narendra Modi is trying to improve the image after the truth is revealed to the public
 'congress is nilaamee ke baad narendra modi se kai sawaal karne vaali he
 If sources are to be believed, all questions have also been prepared by the Congress
 dekhnaa ye hoga ki congress ke in sawaalon kaa bijepi kya jawaab detii he
 Here are the questions for Congress Prime Minister Narendra Modi: 1
 modi ji ab kyon nilaamee kar rahe hai, kya sirf publicity ke liye?2
 Why was the gift of expensive suit taken? 3
 apane naam kaa mahangaa suut agar le bhi liya tha to pahana kyon tha?4
 Being the head of the country, how are they auctioning in Gujarat instead of depositing it in Toshakhana
 ab wo gujarat ke siem nahin, desh ke piem hai?5
 Now Modi's truth has been revealed to the public, is it not just because it is not trying to improve its image? Let me tell you, the gifts that Narendra Modi has received so far through different programs across the country will be auctioned
 is nilaamee ke liye surat main teen divasiy pradarshnee kaa aayojan kiya gaya he
 In this exhibition starting on Wednesday, 455 gifts received by Prime Minister Modi will be put up for auction

 In the initial meetings of a group of 50-50 BJP mps formed under the leadership of 6 senior ministers of the government on the instructions of the Prime Minister, the ministers and PM are having a lot of difficulty in knowing the minds of mps
 beete somvaar ko jahaan videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kii aguwai main saansadon ke samooh se piem mili to pakistan jane se pehle kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne bhi mangalvaar raat endiemasi kanvension centre main pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke saath 50 saansadon ko dinar par bulaayaa
 On behalf of Rajnath Singh, mps were also taught to openly talk about the matter in front of the PM, but most of the mps confined themselves to the praise of the government
 ek ke baad ek saansadon ne jamkar piem modi kii tarif or sarkari yojanaon kaa gungan shuru kiya to piem ko samajhate der nahin lagi ki baithak main wo saansadon ke dil kaa jo dard sunne aae hai, saansad use jaahir karne se hichak rahe hai
 As a result, the PM stopped an MP and clarified that instead of praising the government, the MP would suggest better implementation of the schemes or if it suggests measures to improve the functioning of the government
 piem modi ne sunai ye kahaneepiem ne saansadon ko ek kahani sunaakar jamini hakeekat bataane kaa aagrah kiya
 The PM said that the matter is of those days when he was an RSS pracharak in Gujarat
 un dinon aresas ke ek bade akhil bhartiya adhikari nagpur se gujarat ke daure par aae
 He also visited our district
 daure main unke saamne ek pramukh kaaryakarta ne badha-chadhaakar aresas kii shakhaon kaa byora pesh kiya
 Even where there were no branches, there was talk of starting the work of RSS too
 adhikari bahut prasann ho gaye
 Whatever question he asked, that worker answered every question with great enthusiasm
 nai nai yojanaayen gina daaleen or kaha ki hamaare jile main yojana ke anusaar ye kaam bhi ho gaya he, wo kaam bhi ho gaya he, seva kaary bhi shuru ho gaye hai, shakhaaen gaanv-gaanv fail gai hai, niyamit baithken bhi chal rahi hai
 The Prime Minister said that when those RSS officers left the tour, i asked the worker why did you tell these false things, then that worker laughed and said that brother, poor people from such a distance have come, if i tell them the truth He would have been depressed if he had told, i did not like that he would return to Nagpur after being depressed and disappointed
 so maine unhen sab acha acha bataa diya, chaliye ab jitna ho sakegaa, utana acha karne kii koshish karenge
 As soon as hallpm told the story to the mps and asked the question if you too are not misled by me telling sweet things like the same worker, the mps laughed in the hall of NDMC Convention Center
 picking
 piem ne saansadon ko dil kii baat sunaane ke liye jaise hi utsahit kiya, vaise hi bhadohi ke saansad virendra singh ke dil kaa dard jubaan par aa gaya
 Virendra Singh directly asked the Union Home Minister whether the workers have the right to review the work of the government and ministers
 As soon as the PM and the Home Minister nodded affirmatively in response, Virender Singh asked again how many ministers in the country have sat down with the general workers over the past two years to review the work
 virendra singh ne kaha ki kaaryakarta is baat ko gaanv-gaanv main bol rahaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ke kaaran dilli main desh kaa khajaana surakshit he, us par koi beyimaan or bhrasht netaa yaa afasar nigahen nahin gada saktaa lekin kya ye baat jilon main bhi sach he ?phir sawaal uthaane lage saansdabagapat se saansad satpal singh ne baithak main jativaadee raajnneeti se saavdhaan rahane kii naseehat di
 He raised the question whether BJP is going to tie up with Ajit Singh's party RLD to win elections in UP
 manch par maujuud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne is par kaha ki philhal aisi koi yojana nahin he
 In the meeting, many mps expressed their discomfort with the ministries' lack of hearing
 saansadon ne saaf kaha ki sarkaar ke kai mantriyon kaa bartaav saansadon ke saath acha nahin rahata
 Despite repeated demands, ministers do not give time
 saansadon ke kai jaruri kaam wo nijee kaam bataakar taal dete hai jabaki wo kisi naa kisi kaaryakarta ke parivaar se judaa hota he
 Complaint of the Railway Ministry: An MP made a clear complaint about the Railway Ministry that the families of many sick and elderly workers were not heard in the Ministry
 do saal main saansadon ke kehane par stesan master tak ke sthanantaran nahin ho sake
 Complaints of bureaucracy and gas agency rigging in the LPG distribution scheme among poor families on behalf of several mps also arose in the meeting, on which the PM asked Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to pay attention
 vetan ko lekar hui shikayatkuch saansadon ne vetan or bhatton ke saath saansad nidhi badhaane kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki kshetra main janata kii maang par khara utarane main wo naakaam isliye ho jate hai kyoki unke paas adhikaar simit hai or rajya sarkaar or prashasan se apekshit sahyog nahin mil rahaa he
 The mps also raised the demand to keep the role of mps above the District Magistrate in the district plan so that their involvement in monitoring and implementation of the state's plans with the Center can be maximized
 pehali baithak main shaamil nahin hue the piembite mangalvaar ko jahaan rajnath singh kii aguwai main saansadon ke samooh se piem mili vahiin buudhvaar raat ko airforce mess main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne apane samooh ke saansadon ko dinar par bulaayaa haalanki jiesti bill par rajyasabha main kaarywahi chalane kii vajah se manohar parrikar kii ore se die gaye dinar main piem modi shaamil nahin ho sake

 test cricket main 100 test khelnaa ek cricketer ke kariyar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he
 This occasion becomes more special when he makes it unforgettable with his best performance
 wellington main yahi sochakar newjiland ke captain brendan maikulam maidan main utre lekin is test main unke vipakshi captain ke dimag main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 While New Zealand did not want to leave their best cricketer to commemorate the celebration of their 100th Test in the match just before his farewell match, the Kangaroos were determined to spoil mccullum's party
 wellington ke maidan main utarate hibrandan maikulamatest maichon main100waan testakhelne vaale 64wein cricketer ban gaye lekin apana khaataa khole bagaiyr hi pavilion laut gaye or newjiland ke aise duusare cricketer ban gaye hai jo apane100wein test main shunya par outhua
 While his fans were disappointed with his performance, an innings and 52-run defeat at the hands of Australia in the Test further faded his celebration
 vaise agar baat record kii karen to maikulam 100waan test khilne vaale cricketrs kii list main shaamil hone ke saath hi is test main shunya par out hone vaale ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Thus he has joined the club of cricketers who scored zero in the 100th Test along with Stephen Fleming, Elaine Border, Dilip Vengsarkar and Courtney Walsh
 100wein test main shunya kaa recordkuch aise bhi cricketer hai jinke naam apane 100wein test main shunya par out hone kaa bhi record he
 Top of them is former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming
 inhone dakshin africa ke khilaaf apana 100waan test khelaa or isaki pehali pari main wo khaataa tak nahin khol sake
 However, he managed to score 6 runs in the second innings
 iske alaava australia ke purv captain ailen border (0 or 20 ran) or mark tailor, bharat ke purv captain dilip vengsarakar (25 or 0 ran) or westeindies ke purv captain kartne walsh (naabad 3 or 0) bhi apane 100wein test ko bhoolanaa chahenge
 Australian batsman Justin Langer (retired Hurt at zero) was injured on the first ball of his 100th Test with a thrown bouncer from Makhaya Antini, forcing him to stay away from cricket for the next eight months
 100wein test main kaisaa rahaa he brendan maikulam se pehle is club se judane vaale cricketrs kaa pradarshan? daalate hai ek najar
 In both innings of the 100th Test, a hundred is very important in a century
 koi cricketer centuri jamaata he to use bahut badi uplabdhi maani jaati he or jab koi cricketer ek hi test kii donon pariyon main yah karnama karata he or khaas kar tab jab wo apane kariyar kaa 100waan test match khel rahaa ho to yah or bhi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he or cricket ke maidan main aisa karne vaale ekmaatr cricketer rahe hai australia ke purv captanriki pontingajinhone apane 100wein test kii donon hi pariyon main shatak jamaaya
 Ponting played his 100th Test against South Africa

 Graeme Smith declared the innings only after the first 20 overs on the final day of the Test and set a target of 286 runs in 70 overs against Australia
 ponting ne captaini pari kheli or akele hi 143 ran bana daale or ant tak out hue bina team ko jeet dilaa di
 This test, where one side holds the record of losing in spite of taking the lead in the first innings and then declaring the second innings
 vahiin cricket ke itihaas main test kii donon hi pariyon main ek ballebaaj ke shatak jadne kaa aitihaasik or akelaa maamla he

 jab bura vakt aata he to har ore se aata he or hawa kaa ek jhonka bhi tufaan sareekha jhatka de jaataa he
 This is being seen today in the case of the country's oldest party Congress
 dilli main maujuud party hikeman suubon kii baghawat se ajiz he
 It may be that what has never been seen before, it will decrease and the top leadership of the party cracks
 assam congress main baghawat kii asal kahani yah nahin he ki baagi hemanth biswa sarama mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ko unke pad se hatwa paaenge yaa nahin, balki soobe ke is sankat se kaise nibata jaae, ise lekar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or unke putr tathaa party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bich hi gambhir matbhed ubharkar saamne aane lage hai
 Former Assam Health and Education Minister Sarma has been raising the flag against Gogoi for the last two years
 aisa lagata he ki sonia gandhi unke maamle main naram pad gai hai kyonki unhone sarama se nae mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lene ke liye upyukt muhoort chunane ko kah diya tha
 It should be noted that out of total 126 mlas in the Assam Legislative Assembly, 77 belong to the Congress, with Sarma having 47 mlas
 sarama ne sonia ke vishesh doot mallikarjun khadeye se pichley maah guwahati main do took shabdon main kah diya tha ki ve gogoi ko mukhyamantri pad par nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 Recently, a Congress MP from Assam told Sonia that if the Assam Congress had to be saved, Gogoi would have to be removed
 mana jaataa he ki sonia ne is saansad ko salaah di ki ve yah sthiti rahul ko jaakar samaj den
 It is being said that this mp's meeting with Rahul further worsened the situation as Rahul was not in a mood to listen to Gogoi's criticism at any cost
 bataate hai ki kaaliyabor se is baar loksabhaa ke saansad bane gogoi ke bete gaurav ne rahul ko chah jajbaati email bheje the, jisamen is sankat kii ore se unhen ankhen moond lene kii guzarish kii gai thi
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress vice-president has not bothered to look at Kharge's report yet, instead, instructed Gogoi to deal strictly with the rebels
 aisi sthiti main kaha ja rahaa he ki sarama or unke samarthak party todakar sarkaar ko gira dene ke bare main lagaataar vichaar kar rahe hai
 Before this crisis can subside, the Congress's next major disaster has emerged in Maharashtra where Narayan Rane has resigned from the government before the Assembly elections and targeted his own party's Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan for poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 is
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko maharashtra main 48 main se sirf do siten mili thim
 Rane says that if Chavan is the chief minister, the party will meet the same fate in the assembly elections
 kaha ja rahaa he ki congress kii pramukh gathbandhan sahyogi rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) bhi chavaan ko hataakar unki jagah purv kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ko mukhyamantri banaae jane ke paksh main he
 At the same time, the ruling coalition of the National Conference and Congress in Jammu and Kashmir has also broken
 atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki isi saal ke ant main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress mufti mohammad said kii pidipi ke saath satta bantwaare par kisi samjhaute kii firaaq main he
 Congress spokesperson Salman Soz said that party workers are against the continuation of the alliance after the two parties were eliminated in the Lok Sabha elections
 udhar, haryana main choudhary birendra singh or mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke bich talavaarein khinchi hui hai
 In his second term, the differences with Choudhary are just a hallmark of the disagreements Hooda has faced
 mana ja rahaa he ki choudhary ko khush karne ke liye unhen menifesto cameti kaa sadsy bana diya gaya he
 The question is, will this step suffice? Elections are to be held here in October and the only hope of Congress is that the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and BJP should not join hands
 philhal, aisi hi kamjor ummiido par congress kaa vajood tikaa hua he

 Amid speculation and claims of Chidambaram being made the prime ministerial candidate, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh on Tuesday advocated the appointment of another party general secretary Rahul Gandhi as prime minister
 singh ne rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaaye jane ke sambandh main purv main diye gayi unke vaktavy ke bare main puche jane par kaha ki ve aaj bhi apane bayaan par kaayam hai or yadi rahul gandhi pradhanmantri banate hai to isse sabhi log khush honge
 When asked if the BJP has declared the Chief Minister of Gujarat as its commander, then who is the commander of the Congress, Singh said the Congress general is the party president Sonia Gandhi
 ek anya pradhn ke uttar main singh ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki unhone kabhi bhi narendra modi kii tulana ravan se kii he
 He said that he had said that through hi- tech election campaign, he spoke in one place and appeared in ten places and as far as he remembers there was a character in the Ramayana who spoke with ten heads

 When asked about Aam Aadmi Party's convenor Arvind Kejriwal about the Rs 20,000 crore scam charge on Narendra Modi, Singh said that the Congress party has been making similar allegations since before
 khudara vyapaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke bare main puche jane par singh ne bijepi par domukhi baat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki varsh 2002-03 main bijepi ne is maamle main sau pratishat videshi nivesh kaa prastaav kiya tha jabaki congress ne 51 pratishat videshi nivesh kaa prastaav diya he tathaa isamen 30 pratishat maal desh ke chote evam madhyam udyogon se liye jane kii shart ke saath hi ise kisi rajya main lagu karne main bandhankaree nahin kiya he
 Singh said that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is opposing foreign direct investment in this case, whereas retail goods are being purchased openly from such stores in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan dwaara haal hi shuru kii gayi narmada-kshipraa link pariyojna kii vyavhaarikta ke sambandh main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko us agency kii report ko saarvajanik karnaa chaiye jisane ise avyavhaarik tehraaya he
 In response to a question about the dismal state of roads in Madhya Pradesh, Singh said that during his tenure the condition of national highways was bad, while the condition of state highways was fine, but today the condition of both the roads is poor during BJP rule
 unhone kaha ki yah haalat tab he jab purv kii apeksha bhaajapa sarkaar ko kendra se paanch guna adhik paisa mil rahaa he
 He said that bjp's job is only to take out the tender and after withdrawing the tender, it changes its terms and gives the contract to its selected contractors
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ko is baat kii jaanch karnaa chaiye ki rashtriya rajmarg or rajkeey rajmargon kaa theka kis kis ke paas he

 The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the journalist and social activist Gauri Lankesh murder case has named the right-wing organization Sanatan Sanstha in its additional charge sheet filed in a city court
 pradhan divaani or satr adaalat ke saamne bengalooru main shuukravaar shaam 9,235 pejon kaa yah aarope patr daakhil kiya gaya
 It was also said that the conspiracy to kill Lankesh was hatched by about five people
 isamen kaha gaya he ki goa sthit sanathan sanstha ke andar ke ek network ne lankesh ko nishaanaa banaaya lekin iskaa koi nijee kaaran nahin tha
 a senior SIT official said on Saturday that members of Sanatan Sanstha were involved in it
 hamane iske sahyogi sanghathan kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The charge sheet states that a network within the Satan organization targeted Gauri Lankesh
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki gauri kii hatya kii sajeesh paanch saal se rachi ja rahi thi
 Reacting to the charge sheet, the Goa-based Sanatan Sanstha denied having any connection with the murder of Lankesh, saying that none of the accused were members of it
 abhi tak esaiti ne aisa aadhikarik rup se nahin kaha he
 If the SIT mentions our name in the supplementary charge sheet, we will fight it legally
 samachar agency bhashaa ke anusaar sanstha ke sanchaar pramukh chetan rajhans ne bataaya, ab tak hamen isaki prati (aaropapatr kii) nahin mili he
 If someone tarnishes the name of the organization without proof, then it will have to face legal consequences
 sanathan sanstha par lag sakati he bandishvahin karnataka kaa grih vibhaag kii jimmedaari bhi sambhaal rahe up mukhyamantri ji parameshwar ne kaha ki sarkaar lankesh kii hatya main shaamil sanghathan ko pratibandhit karne ke liye jald hi kadam uthaaegi
 However, he declined to give details of the progress made in the investigation
 vishesh sarkari vakil es baalan ne kaha ki hatyaron or mritak ke bich koi nijee yaa anya ranjish nahin thi
 Why was he (lankesh) murdered? Because she believed in a particular ideology, which she wrote and spoke on
 isliye, yah ek vichaardhaara honi chahie or yah avashya hi koi sanghathan hoga
 The first charge sheet in this case was filed in May
 gauratlab he ki lankesh (55) kii pichley saal paanch sitambar ko yahaan unke awaas ke saamne goli maar kar hatya kar di gai thi
 General VP Malik, who was the head of the Indian Army during the Kargil War, was chosen by the Prime Minister to mediate between the government and ex-servicemen seeking One Rank One Pension (OROP)
 purv sainikon kii maang he ki ritred sainya afasar or sainikon kii pension utani hi honi chahie, jitani maujuuda rank holderon kii he
 At present, there are huge disparities in this case, such as the junior officer retiring at this time, in addition to his own rank, also gets more pension from those who are several rank higher than those who retired earlier
 kuch vishesh sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki chandigarh main rahane vaale general malik, sarkaar or sainikon ke bich is maamle ko sulajhane ke liye dilli aae the, jiske liye purv sainik pichley 10 saal se ladaai lard rahe hai
 It is a different matter that the UPA, first the UPA and now the NDA, is not taking any concrete steps
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shuruyaat main general malik is baatcheet kaa hissaa banane main dilchaspee nahin dikhaa rahe the, lekin baad main piemo or kuch varisht generalon ke kehane par vah is kaam ke liye raji ho gaye
 But seeing a long gap between the two sides, General Malik later pulled out of this case
 darasal maamla pension scale par jaakar atak jaataa he, jis par donon hi paksh sahamat nahin ho paa rahe hai
 The comments sarkaar ke mutabik 2011 ke rate lagu hone chahie, jabaki isaki tulana main 2014 ke rate kaaphi zyada hai or sainik usee dar par pension chaahate hai
 Apart from this, there is a difference of opinion on the date of implementation of One Rank One Pension, because this will decide which officer will get the benefit of this retroactively
 sutron kii maane to is maamle par kisi tarah kii sahmati nahin bana paane ke baad general malik dilli se ravaanaa ho gaye
 The Ministry of Defense has published a few letters, stating that OROP will be based on the 2014 pension scale and that handing it would mean displeasing the protesting troops
 haalanki is baat kii pushti bhi kii gai he ki purv sainik ek samjhaute ke liye raji ho gaye the, jiske anusaar mrit sainikon kii patniyon ko nakad muawza diya jaae, vahiin jesio or afasaron ko bond ke jariye harjaana diya ja saktaa he, lekin baatcheet main aise kisi faisle par sahmati nahin ban pai
 Significantly, the government will spend 12,000 crores on keeping the OROP demand and implementing the policies as per the Supreme Court order, which is 4,000 crores more than the current estimate
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is antar ko piem kii taraf se manjuuri mil sakati he, lekin lagata nahin ki vah apane aise kisi bhi iraade kaa khulaasa swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main karne vaale hai

 Sources say that initially, General Malik was not interested in being part of this conversation, but later agreed to the task at the behest of the PMO and some senior generals
 lekin donon hi pakshon ke bich ek lambii khai ko dekhte hue baad main general malik ne is maamle se apane haath khinch liye
 Actually, the matter gets stuck on the pension scale, on which both the parties are unable to agree
 tippaniyan According to the government, the rates of 2011 should be applicable, as compared to 2014 rates are much higher and soldiers want pension at the same rate
 iske alaava van rank van pension ke lagu hone kii taarikh ko lekar bhi matbhed jari he, kyonki isi se tay hoga ki koun-se afasar ko iskaa purvaprabhavi rup se phayda milegaa
 If sources are to be believed, General Malik left Delhi after not being able to reach any agreement on the matter
 raksha mantralay ne kuch chitthiyaan prakashit kii hai, jinamein likhaa gaya he ki oropi 2014 kii pension scale par aadhaarit hoga or isse haath khinchne kaa matlab pradarshnkaree sainikon ko naaraaz karnaa hoga
 Although it has also been confirmed that the ex-servicemen had agreed to an agreement, according to which the wives of the deceased soldiers should be given cash compensation, while the jcos and officers can be awarded damages through bonds, but in negotiations No such decision could be agreed
 gauratlab he ki oropi maang ko maanane or supreme court ke aadeshnusaar nitiyon ko lagu karne par sarkaar ke 12,000 karod kharch honge, jo maujuuda akalan se 4,000 karod zyada he
 It is being told that this gap can be cleared by the PM, but it does not seem that he is going to disclose any of his intentions in the Independence Day speech

 The government's decision was also welcomed by the Army and the Defense Ministry has also passed an order in this regard
 lekin is sabake bich kendriya karmchaariyon kii saatven vetan ayog ko lekar kai maangen abhi bhi ataki hui he
 Many more issues have still not reached their end
 karmchaariyon ko sabase zyada nunatam vetanman or alouns ko lekar utsukata bani hui he
 For information, let us know that in this cabinet meeting, the cabinet note related to the issue of Allowance was to be presented but this note has not been prepared yet
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke abhi is note ko taiyaar hone main 10-15 din kaa samay or lag saktaa he
 Information has been received that the issue has not yet reached the Empower Committee

 From here this committee will give its recommendation after which the cabinet will be ready

 is puri deree se karmchaaree varg bahut naaraaz he
 He said that he has met the cabinet secretary about this outrage
 karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke sambandh main unhone cabinet secretary ko avgat karaayaa he
 Also, he told that now the employees will hold their meeting on all these issues and discuss the strategy ahead

 nadisutrah ekasokhaa
 This word flashes dry and cracked ground and scorching sky above in the mind
 barish gadabad ho jaati he to nadi-naale, gaanv ke kuen sab suukh jate hai
 The fields turn into dust-filled bowls
 jaanavar or parinde pyaase bhatakate hai
 This black shadow has become a reality this summer and it has already taken a worrying look
 puure hindustan main vinaashkari sookhaa dastak de rahaa he or pehle se hi sankat jhel rahi madhya pattee ke upar kahar barapaane kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 In such a situation, remember what happened to our Sadanira rivers? The nadisutra series is an attempt to find the formula that we have forgotten
 aakhir, jis desh ne apane shahar nadiyon ke kinare basaae, jis desh ne apane puja-sanskaar kii vidhiyaan nadiyon ke kinare or nadiyon ko lekar viksit kiye, nadiyaan devi maani gayi, vahaan yah sutara gaayab kaise ho gaya
 After all, our oldest scripture, which is also the voice of the Gods, mentions in detail the rivers and its glory in all the Vedas, Upanishads, Brahmins, including the Rigveda
 rugveda ke dasham mandal ke pachhattaraven sookt main kaha gaya halliyan me gange! yamune! saraswati! shatudri! stoman sachat parushthya
 Asiktya Marud Vriddh! Live tight! Shrinuhyasuvoya
 
 So what happened to our society suddenly that we considered rivers and lakes and ponds as garbage? Started plotting to dry them
 hamaare desh kii har nadi ke saath loakgeet hai, unase judy lokkathaayen hai
 There is a little history and a little science
 parampara or reeti-rivaaj to khayr hai hi
 In such a situation, what we think about rivers, Nadi Sutra is also a reality check of its kind
 maine khud ganga ke kinare gomukh se lekar gangasagar tak kaa safar tay kiya he
 How the country has forgotten the rivers and the situation of its rivers, i will try to present their narrative and agony in a series of ways
 ummid he ki nadiyon ke kinare khadey, paley or bade samaaj ko apane jalaashyon, talabon, pokharon, dabaron, baavadiyon or naale-johdo kii yaad aae
 The effort in this series will be that in this, the readers should not just get the details of negativity and frustration
 ganga hi nahin desh kii jin bhi nadiyon ke kinare-kinare, jahaan tak bhi maine safar kiya he, jinase bhi main mila, un sabaki baaten, unke bataras, unke kahe kisse or lokgeeton or lokkathaon kaa ek vishaal to nahin, lekin ek anokhaa or nae kism kaa anubhav hamen hua, or use aapke saamne jyon kaa tyon rakh dene kii koshish karenge
 We met many scientists on the journey, many of whom kept talking about the unique self-purifying potential of the Ganges River
 ganga hi nahin tamaam nadiyon ke pradooshan par bhi baat karne vaale kai log the, kai shraddhalu mili jo sirf puranikta kii, shraddha kii baaten karte rahe
 For whom ganga-yamuna-narmada-kaveri-godavari are the source of unfailing faith
 lekin hamen kai aise log mili jinhone idhar-udhar, kabhi chaay kii dukaan to kabhi kisi hotel kii lobby main hamen nadiyon se jude kisse sunaae
 Some of these stories are mythological, some are legends and legends and some are folklore
 in kahani sunaane waalon main se kai alag-alag pradeshon ke the, jo apni jado se dur apane ilaake kii aisi kahaniyaan hamen suna rahe the, jisamen kahin na kahin, koi na koi nadi maujuud thi
 These include everything from a hotel manager to a waiter, a paddleman in the rivers to a pundit, and a washerman washing clothes to gopod sitting at a tea shop
 misaal ke taur par, chhattisgarh kaa kissa he jo mujhe uttar pradesh ke tirth vindhyachal ke paas kisi dhabas main ek bhakt ne sunaaya
 He came from Raipur
 mata vindhyavasini ke darshan karne
 He had sung the song of Bhojali
 yah geet bahuen gaati hai, jisamen ganga kaa sambodhan hota he,devi ganga, lahar turangaamro bhojali devi kebhije othon anga
 But many scholars have put forth a new fact for the condition of Ganga besides corruption and lack of rivers in the political agenda
 vah tha, midiokar visheshgyon kaa bahulya
 That is, the efficiency and opinions of so-called experts in our country about rivers
 yah baat hairaan kar dene vaali nikali ki jin ejiniyaron kii badaulat kai-kai yojanaayen or ection plan ko banaakar lagu karne kii koshish kii gai, darasal main unke vichaaron main hi polapan tha
 Many experts have almost proved that there is a big crisis in the education of universities in the science of rivers, while students studying abroad or meritorious students are not part of the government machinery
 natijatan, samaadhaan kii ruparekha main hi paripakvata kii kami rahi he
 For example, the concept and theory of the river is not clear from common to specific
 aam taur par mana jaataa he ki nadi kaa kaam pani le janaa he, jo aage jaakar samudr main mil jaati he
 But, have we ever heard that the work of the river is also to carry silt? This is especially important in the context of rivers like the Ganges
 yah buniyadi soch hi shaayad yojanaon or pariyojnaon main jagah nahin bana pai, nateeja farkka baraj jaisi pariyojnaayen hoti hai
 Which not only rendered millions of people homeless, but also immersed thousands of hectares of fertile land
 ganga jaisi nadi hamaari sabhyataa, hamaare paap-punya sabko sambhalati rahi, lekin aabaadi or ummiido ke boj ne use aaj haraa diya he
 Often must have heard stories related to corruption in projects and campaigns related to Ganga cleaning
 desh ke kisi bhi hisse main nadiyon or nadi ghaatiyon ko lekar sarkari soch main ek nirantarata milti he
 That is, creating and implementing large projects
 asal main, badi pariyojnaon kaa phayda sabko miltaa he, sirf nadi or unke beton ko chhodkar
 That means big projects, big amount, big cut
 badi saamaanya-si baat he
 But the projects were also built and built and are still being woven by Western countries
 farkka baraj isi kaa udhaaharan he
 Drought is taking a terrible form
 akaal se bhayanak he akele pad janaa
 We have to learn to move along the rivers
 ekayami vikaas nahin balki satat vikaas kii ore badhanaa hoga jisamen saaf-suthri, jivit or kalakal-nirmal-aviral nadiyon kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hogi

 By donating Chillam to Baba Ramdev on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the sadhus made a historic beginning towards fulfilling the dream of a 'drug free India' in the Kumbh (kumbh) complex on Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary in Prayagraj
 Inaugurating the Quit Movement, Baba Ramdev praised the sages for their all-inclusive compatibility and said that drug addiction, Chillam etc
 would bring disgrace and honor to our great saint tradition
 Land
 baba ramdev ne kaha ki jab ham kalyaan ke liye ghar-parivaar or moh-maaya chhodkar is paavani rishi parampara main aa gaye to kya ham nasha, chilam or tambaaku aadi nahin chhod sakate? is par sarvapratham nirmohi akhaade ke mahant rajendra das maharaj ne chilam daan dekar is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii or nasha mukti ke liye sankalp liya
 This is the same arena which takes the first royal bath in Kumbh
 baba ramdev ke pravaktaa esake tijarawala ne enditivi ko bataaya ki is avasar par shri panch tera bhai tyaagi khalsa akhaada (tyaagiyon kii jamaat) ke bhagavat das ji, tulsidas ji, laal baba, manoj das kii prerana se or baba ramdev ke aahnan par saikadon sadhu-sanyaasiyon ne chilam daan kii or shapath lee
 Baba Ramdev Maharaj while addressing this sangat said that we are all children of one God
 ham sab ek samaan hai, sab mahaan hai
 Our blood is one and our ancestors are one
 koi oonch-neech nahin or koi bhedbhaav nahin
 Our ancestors Gautama, Kanadi, Jaimini, Panini, Patanjali, Rama, Krishna etc
 did not drink any chillam
 hamane saadhuon kaa or sant parampara kaa gaurav badhaayaa he
 We sacrifice, meditate, do public welfare
 baba ramdev ne kaha ki mahatmaon ne videshiyon kaa shirshasana karaayaa he
 Saints are philanthropists
 ham rojgaar dete hai
 We have given employment to two lakh people and are protecting religion and culture
 unhone aage kaha ki main yuvaaon kaa nasha chhudvaata hum tab log kehete hai ki aap mahatmaon kaa nasha kyon nahin chhudvaate ho
 What should i answer for this? You donate your money, give up addiction and become an inspiration for humanity

 This is a question that will decide what will be the direction of development in the Himalayas and what model of development will be adopted there
 june 2013 main himalay ne apane itihaas kii sabase badi aapadaa dekhi
 Thousands of people lost their lives in the floods in Kedarnath
 maut kaa sarkari aankada chah hazaar ke aasapaas he lekin yah sab jaanate hai ki uttarakhand main isse kahin adhik logon kii jaan gai
 Many houses were destroyed and property worth crores was washed away
 do saal baad bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab milane baaki hai
 The wait is also the answer to the question made by the Supreme Court in which the court asked the government, what is the role of the dams being built in Uttarakhand in the Kedarnath tragedy? Two years later, the government is still avoiding the answer
 isi maheene teen june ko centre sarkaar ne ek nayaa aadesh jari kar ek nai cameti banaai he
 This committee will review all the reports given so far on the Kedarnath tragedy
 sarkaar ne adaalat main kaha tha ki vah kuch exparts ko cameti main shaamil kar ek baar phir se uttarakhand ke himalayan kshetra main baandhon ke asar par apni report degi
 But the government has changed all the members except the one member of the Ravi Chopra Committee formed earlier
 centre sarkaar kah rahi he ki panel kii ye niyukti niyamon ke tahat or court ke aadesh ke mutabik hui he lekin nadiyon or himalay ke paryaavaran ke liye lard rahe log is faisle se khush nahin hai
 Himanshu Thakkar, who has been studying dams, rivers and their impact on human life for a long time, says, 'the central government and the Uttarakhand government are playing with the lives of the people of Uttarakhand and the existence of the Ganges
 kuch baandh companiyon ke munaafe ko ahmiyat dete huye supreme court ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 On one side, the government gave the first affidavit that the dams had a hand in the disaster
 phir court ko bharosa dilaayaa ki vah puraani cameti main kuch jaankaar shaamil kar ab tak kii reports kaa rivyuu karaayegi
 But now there is no independent people in the new committee formed
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kisi baandh lobby ke dabaav main kaam kar rahi he
 Comments court ne jab 2013 main sarkaar ko baandhon ke role kii jaanch karne ke aadesh diye to ravi chopra cameti banaai gai jisaki report uttarakhand ke baandhon ke khilaaf rahi
 The Chopra Committee described the dams as dangerous and said that these dams had a definite role in the Kedarnath disaster
 wildlife institute of india ne bhi baandhon par sawaal khadey kiye
 After this, Vinod Tare Committee was formed which gave special report about 6 dams especially in the state and termed them as dangerous
 iske baad sarkaar ne bhi adaalat main kaha ki baandh khatarnaak hai
 But after the meeting held in the Prime Minister's Office in January this year, the government turned around and there was a lot of controversy
 yamuna jiye abhiyaan se jude or purv iesces adhikari manoj mishra kehete hai, ‚Äòab tak sari cametiyon ne bade bade baandhon ke khilaaf report di he lekin sarkaar ke rukh ko dekhakar lagata he ki vah har haal main kisi cameti se vah baat kahalava dena chaahati he jo ab tak kisi cameti ne nahin kahi he

 Ever since the promos of Akshay Kumar's film 'baby' started appearing on TV and cinema screen, many questions have arisen in the minds of the audience
 jaise ki film ke promo messkshay kumararmi afasar kii bhoomika main dikh rahe hai
 They are seen beating and searching for terrorists, but why the film was named 'baby'
 darshakon ke man main sawaal is baat ko lekar bhi hai ki akshay kumaar pehle hi ‚Äòhe baby‚Äô naam kii ek film main kaam kar chuke hai, phir unhone ‚Äòbaby‚Äô naam kii is film ko kyon sweekaar kar liya
 The film is coming soon on the cinema screen, but the audience wants to understand what is the connection between the story of this film and its name 'baby'
 film ke nirdeshak niraj pandey kaa kahana he ki film ke naam ke peeche koi bahut bada rahasy nahin he
 He said that the operation in which Akshay Kumar and his friends are part of the film is named 'baby'
 yah team 5 saal ke trial par gai he or oparation abhi apane shuruaati daur main hi he, isliye film kaa naam ‚Äòbaby‚Äô rakhaa gaya he
 Director Neeraj Pandey has previously made films like 'A Wensday', 'special 26', while he has produced the film 'total Saypa'
 unhone ‚Äòe venesde‚Äô or ‚Äòspecial 26‚Äô kii kahani, screenple or dialog bhi khud hi likhe the

 The Election Commission has announced the elections of five states, but the complete information about the criminal record is still not given by the Election Commission
 ashvini upaadhyaay ne apni yachika main kaha he ki chunaavon main ummidavaaron ko mahaj yah nahin bataanaa hoga ki kis dhara ke tahat un par mukadmaa chal rahaa he, balki yah bhi bataanaa hoga ki vah dhara unpar kyon lagi he
 For example, if a candidate writes Section 302, then he will also have to tell that a murder case is going on him
 is janhit yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki yah tay hona chahie ki print or electronic media main kam se kam teen baar ummidavaar jo bhi jaankaree de rahaa he, usamen apni shaikshik yogyata, chal achal sampatti kaa vivaran or aparaadhik record ke bare main puri jaankaree honi chahie
 The Delhi High Court has agreed to hear this petition and is expected to hear the case on Tuesday
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki dilli hai court chunaav ayog ko nirdesh de ki supreme court main haal hi main aae aadesh kaa paalan to ho hi, saath hi is maamle main ummidavaar kii taraf se radio, tivi yaa akhbaar main jo bhi soochna chunaav ke maddenjar di ja rahi ho uskaa 30 fisadi uske aapraadhik record, uski umr, sampatti ko lekar ho
 For example, if the candidate is giving complete information about himself in 2 minutes, then in 36 seconds he will have to keep criminal records, property details and age
 saath hi ye puri jaankaree ummidavaar kii taraf se apni party ko di jaae, or party isaki jaankaree apni website par de
 The party will have to give full information to the Election Commission, and the Election Commission will also have to put this information on its website

 menka gandhi ne apane twitor acount par is ghatana ko lekar ek ke baad ek kai twit kiye
 Maneka Gandhi said that killing Avni tigress is a case of clean crime
 bataa den ki maharaashtra main ek abhiyaan chalaa kar avani ko maut kii neend sula diya gaya
 It is believed that this ferocious tigress hunted 13 people
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki kai baar kai sanghathanon dwaara apil kiye jane ke baad bhi maharashtra ke van mantri es es mungantiwar ne is baghin ko maarane ke aadesh die

 menka ne kaha, "ye teesraa baagh he jisaki hatya kii gai he, iske alaava kai tendua or bhaaluu bhi maare gaye hai
 It is nothing but a straight case of crime
 Despite several requests from many stakeholders, sh@smungantiwar, Minister for Forests, # Maharashtra, gave orders for the killing
 # justice4tigressavni ‚Äî Maneka Gandhi (@manekagandhibjp) November 4, 2018 Maneka Gandhi strongly criticized the Maharashtra government, saying, 'it is completely illegal, forest department officials are able to faint and catch the tigress, yet the shooter Shafat Ali Khan killed him on the orders of the Forest Minister of Maharashtra
 jaanwaron ke prati prem kaa bhav rakhane ke liye mashhoor menka ne kaha ki ve is maamle ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke saath uthaaengi

 This is seen as a lifeline in the constantly deteriorating relationship between the Congress and the DMK, and that is why the Congress is denying any threat to the UPA government

 In view of the increasing fees in private schools, the government is constantly improving the condition of government schools
 skulon main padhai kii lachar vyavastha or tesearch ke gairjimmedaarana ravaiye ko aade haath lete hue kuch rajya sarkarein teachers ke rang-birange kapadon se lekar unke mobile istemaal tak par pabandi laga rahi hai
 In some states, it is also being claimed that a lot of work has been done on education in government schools and cleanliness of the campus and now there is no such situation

 Due to this the average enrollment has reduced from 122 to 108 per school in the last 5 years

 phir kya vajah he ki bharat ke sarkari skulon, jahaan garib bacchon ko 14 saal kii umr tak ni:shulk shiksha di jaati he, phir bhi chaatr mahange nijee skulon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 Taking the data of DISE as the basis, parents of the children in the study were asked the reason for this, their reply was that the standard of education in private schools is better than the government schools

 aisi koun-si baaten hai, jo votaron ko congress kii ore khinch sakati hai
 i will vote for Ajay Maken, because
 
 
 isi silsile ko aage badhaate hue yah report di ja rahi he ki main congress or ajay maakan ko vot nahin duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 1
 maakan ke donon pratidwandvi zyada bharosemandadilli main bijepi kii siem pad kii ummidavaar kiran bedi or AAP kii ore se siem pad ke daavedaar arvind kejariwal, ajay maakan kii tulana main zyada bharosemand hai
 Corruption was curbed during Kejriwal's 49-day government in Delhi
 bijli kii dar main kami kii gai
 Kiran Bedi's image has also been that of an honest and strict administrator
 is lihaaj se ajay maakan kaa daawa kamjor maaloom padataa he
 i will vote for Kiran Bedi, because
 
 
 2
 Congress does not expect development, even after so many years of independence, seeing the condition of the country today, it does not seem that the Congress will be able to develop Delhi
 duusari ore bijepi ne vikaas kaa naaraa buland karke janata main ummid jagaai he
 AAP also has a concrete plan for Delhi's development
 public ko aisa lagata he ki congress vikaas kii raajnneeti karti hi nahin he
 i will vote for Arvind Kejriwal, because
 
 
 3
 Congress has allowed the bad image of Delhi, the Congress which has ruled Delhi for the longest time, leaving the state of the capital is painful
 dilli ke bichombich anginat sankhya main slam, lachar drenez system, sadakon par jahaan-tahaan gandagi kaa ambara- yahi duniya main dilli kii pahchaan ban gai he
 Delhi is counted among the dirtiest capitals in the world
 duusari ore BJP kii modi sarkaar ne 'svachh bharat mishan' chalaakar dilli kii bhi dasha badalane kii koshish kii he
 Congress candidates also get defeated here
 4
 How will Maken improve the political system? The biggest question is how Ajay Maken will improve the political system? Maken is a leader cast in the old political mold
 agar ve system main sudhaar ke liye koi bada kadam uthaanaa chahenge, to kya congress alaakaman se unhen is baat kii ijaajat mil jaaegi? congress main andruni demokrasi kii haalat janata se chhipi nahin he
 5
 andolan se maakan kaa naata nahindesh ke lachar system or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan se ajay maakan yaa unki party kaa koi judaav nahin he
 If there is any connection, it is just that at the time of the agitation, both the Center and Delhi had the Congress government
 duusari ore kejariwal or kiran bedi, donon hi anna andolan se sakriy rup se jude rahe hai
 In such a situation, both these candidates are heavy on Maken
 main arvind kejariwal ko vot nahin karuunga, kyonki
 
 
 6
 yuva kii najar main kejariwal va bedi adarshaaaj kii yuva peedi ajay maakan kii bajaae arvind kejariwal yaa kiran bedi ko hi apana adarsh maananaa pasand karegi
 By facing a lot of challenges in a short time, both of them have set an example in front of the youth
 phir maakan ko kaise mili vot?7
 The public wants change After the long rule of the Congress, the AAP government was formed, which could not complete its tenure
 mahaj do maheenon main janata ko AAP ko thik tarah se parakhane kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 The people of Delhi have not seen the BJP government for 15 years
 aise main public congress ko chhodkar kisi or party ko hi aajmaana chaahegi
 i will not vote for Kiran Bedi, because
 
 
 8
 Congress did not cash in on the opportunity Delhi's people gave the Congress plenty of opportunity, but the party has failed to capitalize on it
 logon ke bich ek bada sawaal yah bhi he ki congress ko ek or chance milane par kahin is maukey ko ganvaa to nahin degi
 9
 congress ke liye 'daag' dhonaa mushkilcongress raaj main kaamanwealth games samet bhrashtachar ke kai maamle saamne aae
 In such a situation, Congress has become a negative image among the public
 iskaa phayda bijepi or AAP ko mil saktaa he
 10
 mahangaai se nijaat chaahati he janatapublic mahangaai se chhutkaaraa chaahati he
 The BJP government at the Center has created better expectations in this direction
 AAP bhi janata kii pareshaaniyon ko samajhati he
 It has been seen that whenever the Congress government is formed, the graph of inflation goes up
 pareshaan janata baar-baar congress se sawaal puuchhati he, 'ye kya haal bana rakhaa he?'
 
 
 Our own and the entire country

 The sensible in politics is the one who changes himself according to the thinking of the public
 america politicianhilari rodam clintneeski tazatreen or behtareen misaal hai
 In 2008, Hillary Rodham Clinton submitted a US presidential nomination for the Democratic Party, but fell behind Barack Obama
 2012 main obama dobaaraa raashtrapati ban gaye
 Eight years later, Hillary is back in the fray
 in aath saalon main duniya kaaphi badal chuki he - lihaaja hillari ne bhi khud ko khaasaa badal liya he
 There has been a big difference in the thinking of Hillary and now Hillary
 vakt se siikhaa, khud ko badlahilari clintne apane puraane chunavi anubhav se kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 This time she looks more mature
 pichley chunaav abhiyaan ke centre main hillari khud khadi thim, is baar vahaan aam america najar aa rahe hai
 She is constantly touring from the city to remote areas
 wo aam americanyon se sidhe samvaad kaayam karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 She had missed the same point last time
 ye unki shakhsiyat main aae sabase bade badlaav kaa sanket he
 What the video says is the biggest evidence of change in the thinking of Hillary's video released on Sunday
 is video main hillari clinton kah rahi hai ki wo america logon ko champion bananaa chaahati hai jo america logon kii rosemara kii soch he
 The video features a mother who returns to work after raising a child, a girl who applies for her first job, two Spanish-speaking brothers starting their new business
 ye sab kaise hota he
 This is the same struggle of common American which has become important for them now
 yahi baat unke chunavi abhiyaan ko hakeekat ke kareeb laa rahaa he, jo pichhali baar ke khyaali pilav se koson dur he
 The first opponent, now support Menhileri, today is supporting the same gay marriage issue in which she has been an outspoken opponent
 ye hillari kaa wo paropkaaree paksh he jo badalte vakt ke saath viksit hua he - or aam americanyon kii tarah unki soch main bhi swaabhaavik tabdili ai dikhti he
 Hillary insists that her thinking on this issue has changed positively
 pichley maheene indiana ne jab dharmik swatantraaa kanoon banaaya to hillari ne twit kar apana virodh jataayaa tha
 Hillary was seen standing up with critics of the law who fear that this would make LGBT people's lives worse
 aaj saath khadey hai obamamerica raashtrapati baraak obamane 2008 main ummidavaari kii daud main clinton ko shikast de di thi, lekin aaj wo bhi unke saath khadey hai
 Regarding Hillary, Obama said, 'she was an important supporter and ally of mine in the general election
 videsh mantri ke rup main unka kaam ullekhneey rahaa he
 She is my friend and i think she will be a successful and excellent President
 'kaaphi majboot he team clintontim hillari is baar zyada prabhavi or aakraamak logon se saji hui he
 Hillary's election campaign chief John Podest is not only close to him but also to his former President Bill Clinton, who was his Chief of Staff in the White House under his rule
 khaas baat ye he ki 2008 ke chunaav ke dauraan unhone obama kii team kii aguwai kii thi - or aaj bhi unke kareebi hai
 Hillary is going to get a lot of benefit from this
 hillari ke campan manager robin mook ne 2008 main hillari kaa chunaav abhiyaan sambhala tha or kai ilaakon main badhat dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Apart from these, stalwarts such as Joel Beneson, Jim Maragolis, and Jennifer Palamiri have been included in Hillary's team
 bahut mushkil he dagarhilari ke liye sabase badi chunauti he anti inkambency factor
 The Democratic Party has been in power for eight years - and Hillary must face the public's anti-incumbency mood
 jaankaron kii raay main hillari ke liye democratic party kii ummidavaari jeetna aasaan he lekin raashtrapati chunaav jeetna thodaa mushkil he
 Although the air is believed to be in favor of the Democrats in the US, but will the American public like Hillary, who has long experience ranging from senator to foreign minister? This is the big question at the moment
 pratham naagarik rah chukin hillari agar chunaav jeet jaati hai to america kii pehali mahila raashtrapati hongi
 The condition is that the American public wholeheartedly accept the big change in Hillary's thinking
 ek kahawat badi charchit he ki rishte bananaa jitna aasaan hota he rishte nibhaana utana hi kathin
 Many times it has been observed that due to lack of coordination, people are unable to maintain a long-term relationship
 agar jivan main aage badhane ke liye brallep karnaa jaruri ho jaae to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 But we are telling you some things that you need to remember during the breakup
 1- ek duusare ko blem naa karen- insaan kaa ye swabhaav hota he ki wo apni naakaamiyon kaa thikra duusare par phodta he
 When you have already decided to separate, then it will be appropriate to be happy
 isse aap sakaaratmak tareeke se alag ho sakenge
 2- Different means different- If two people are spending a lot of time together, then they should not keep the scope of friendship among themselves
 aisa karnaa unke liye kaaphi kathin hoga
 The moments spent together during a relationship are more than friendship, we do it to show formality but it is not possible
 behatar yahi hoga ki yatharth ko sweekaar karen or jivan main aage badhen
 Know these things before reconnecting a broken relationship
 3- Tattoos will not hurt - at least it has been seen that after the breakup, people tattoo their ex boyfriend's name on their body to make the relationship memorable
 
 aisa karnaa sahi nahin he
 Because it will remind you of what is no longer yours
 4- nae rishte kaa khulaasa turant naa karen-brallep ke baad agar aap kisi duusare ke saath talmail baitha chuke hai to ye acchhee baat he
 But it would not be right to mention it immediately
 agar aapke purv premi ko koi nayaa saathi nahin mil rahaa he to use ye khabar sun or dukh ho saktaa he
 After passing some time, openly disclose the new relationship
 6 baaten jo bataati hai ki 'unhen' pasand hai aap5- nashe main naa karen kol yaa massej- nashe ke dauraan aadmi zyada samvedansheel hota jaataa he
 During this time he is not in his whole senses
 aise main apane eks ko kol karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 During this time you can execute an argument and make the relationship worse than bad
 gujarat kii rajdhani ahmedabad ke municipal skool board ne ek tughluqi farmaan nikaala he
 On Saturday, on the occasion of Vasant Panchami, Saraswati Vandana should be performed in all the schools under the school board, including Muslim schools
 muslim skulon ne is farmaan kaa virodh kiya he
 Police's Taliban act, let the loving couple leave the village
 There are about 65 Urdu schools in the Ahmedabad Municipal School Board, mostly in the Muslim areas of Ahmedabad, Jamalpur, Juhapura, Danilimada, Chandola and Shahpur, about 18,000 Muslim students studying in these schools
 Huh
 skool board ne farmaan main likhaa he- 'vasant panchami vidya, kala, gyaan or sangeet kii devi maa saraswati kii aradhana kaa parv he, isiilie is din prarthana sammelan maa saraswati pujan kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 To achieve enlightenment through Saraswati Vandana
 vasant panchami kaa parv duusare rajyon main kaise manaaya jaataa he uski jaankaree bhi prarthana sabha main di jaani chahie
 'at the same time, parents are also worried about this Tughlaqi decree of Ahmedabad Municipal School Board
 abhibhavakon kaa manaanaa he ki yah unki dharmik bhaawanaaon se khilwaad kiya ja rahaa he
 Muslim leader Imran Khedawala in Ahmedabad said, 'the order has been given through the Municipal School Board
 muslim shiksha letaa he, ibaadat karata he
 Muslim child cannot worship
 jis korporation ne aisa kiya, muslim kabhi bhi isse sahamat nahin he
 We oppose the way this Tughlaki decree has been pronounced
 'vahiin bijepi ki satta vaali ahmedabad municipal skool board ke chairman kaa kahana he ki saraswati vandana hi shiksha kaa ekmaatr jariya he, vaise main bacchon ko acchhee baat bataanaa or shiksha ke liye utsahit karnaa hi is saraswati puja or vandana kaa makasad he
 Seeing the manner in which Royal Challengers Bangalore defeated the Gujarat Lions in the first qualifier match of the IPL, everyone had the same saying 'cricket is a Game of Uncertainty'
 gujarat lines kii team dwaara 159 ranon ke set kiye lakshya kaa peechha karne utari royal chalangers bangalore ne shuruaati 6 overs main keval 29 ranon par paanch wicket ganvaa chuki thi
 There was also a record wicket of Captain Kohli, who scored a record 918 runs, who was out for zero in the IPL for the first time
 yahaan se bagdorabi divilliarsane sanbhali jo tab 11 ran banaakar duusari chor se wicket girtaa hua dekh rahe the
 De Villiers then did what he will remember for a long time
 aadhi team pavilion laut chuki thi or sabase ahm task aage bina kisi nuksaan ke 9
 The run at 14 was to keep the momentum going towards victory
 diggaj divilliars ne yahi kiya or unhone apane kariyar kii sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek kheli
 He hit 78 from the next 133 runs and that too only 38 balls
 isaki badaulat bangalore kii team 10 gend shesh rahete hi jeet mil gai
 But the match did not end here
 is jeet ke turant baad jo hua wo ab viral ho chalaa he
 As soon as the match was over, the Bangalore team started running towards the de Villiers in the field
 inamen captain viraat kohli, yujavendra chaahal or sarfaraj khan sabase aage daud rahe the
 On reaching the pass, Yuzvendra Chahal jumped on the de Villiers
 divilliars awak rah gaye or unke sir par laga helmet gir gaya
 He remained completely motionless for some time
 unhen jor se chot lagi
 He immediately rubbed his face but did not show blood stains
 iske baad divilliars bhi jeet kaa jashn manaane main lag gaye
 However, a big red spot started appearing on his chin
 yah helmet strap se chot lagane kii vajah se chhilane kaa nishaan tha
 Later Chahal also apologized to de Villiers and late night he tweeted and once again regretted this whole sentence
 I'm really sorry bro@abdevilliers17but thank for tonight # loveyouand not least@iqqiabdullahwell done ü§óü§ópic

 bijepi ke satta main aane par swayan ke mukhyamantri banane ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki vah is paricharchaa main nahin padana chaahati
 While dismissing the news of the ruthlessness of the top leaders of the party for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election campaign, Uma Bharti said that there are many capable leaders in the party, there is no faction and this is the strength of the party
 party ke sabhi netaa ek ikai ke rup main kaam kar rahe hai or shandaar safalataa praapt karenge
 When asked about the bjp's chief ministerial candidate in Uttar Pradesh, he said, "the party mlas who decide will be the leader
" main is paricharchaa main nahin padana chaahati
 'uma said to Charkhari,' i believe that if only one person in a party deserves the post of Chief Minister or only one Prime Minister, then it is an indication of the weakness of that party
 bijepi main kai sakasham netaa hai
 This is the strength of the party which is presented upside down
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòpratham charan kaa chunaav aath farvari ko he

 ‚Äôuma ne kaha, ‚Äòmuslim matadaata sabhi baton ko samajhataa he, vah inke jhaanse main nahin aayegaa
 In Uttar Pradesh, BJP is benefiting the most
 congress kii chaal log samaj gaye hai
 Asked about the case of BJP opposing corruption and taking the former BSP expelled Kushwaha to the party, Uma said that Kushwaha has clarified his position and requested the party to suspend his membership
 vah apane aap ko nirdosh sabit karne kaa mauka chaahate hai or is vishay main pahal bhi kii he
 When asked about calling him an outsider in Uttar Pradesh, Uma asked, "who said i am an outsider
" ‚Äô is sambandh main bijepi netaa calraj mishra, congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi kii tippanee kaa ullekh kiye jane par unhone kaha, ‚Äòcalraj mishra ne iskaa khandan kiya he

 ‚Äôunke virdohi maane jane vaale madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanake unke paksh main prachaar karne ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‚Äòmaine bhi unke liye prachaar kiya he
 He will also campaign for me

 We are like siblings
 ‚Äôcongress par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi kii varisht netaa ne kaha, ‚Äòtu ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale main ucchtam nyaayalay kaa faisla aitihaasik he

 All these recommendations will be sent to the MCC main committee and if approved, these changes will be included in the new Code of Cricket Law which will come into effect from October 1, 2017

 Ponting said, "we want to limit the edges from 38 to 42 millimeters
 kuch khilaadiyon ke balle ke kinare 50 millimetre se adhik hai
 We are happy with what we have suggested because it will balance between bat and ball
 hamane dekha he ki balle ke kinaaron se lagakar gend chah ran ke liye chali jaati he
 However, despite limiting the size of the bat, the big hitters will be able to hit sixes
 ‚Äònae niyam daraane kaa kaam karegaa‚Äôgend se chhedchhad ke niyamon main haalanki koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 On the question of red card being shown to the players, Brearley said that it will act as a scare

 The red card will also be shown in extreme cases

 'the player may be thrown out for threatening the umpire, physically harming another player, umpire, officer or spectator, or for other violent activity on the playground
 helmet se gend takaraane ke niyam main badlaavis bade badlaav kaa kaaran yah he ki samiti kaa maananaa he ki cricket aisa khel he jisamen khilaadi ke bure bartaav ke liye ampire ke paas maidan par dene ke liye koi sajaa nahin he
 The committee said that according to the change in the rule related to hitting the ball with the fielder's helmet, if the fielder is wearing a helmet, it can be caught and stumped after hitting the ball
 philhal wicketiper ke pad se takaraakar kaich or stump kiye ja sakate hai jabaki ise pahananaa vaikalpik he or aise main yah anuchit lagata he ki helmet se gend ke takaraane par aisi sweekruti nahin di jaae jise pahananaa kuch deshon main anivaary he
 There will be no four-day Test Cricket Committee also discussed the four-day test and day-night test, but did not agree

 The Supreme Court has expressed displeasure with the Law Ministry as to why it did not set up a permanent mechanism to track the disproportionate increase in the assets of the candidates in the last few years despite the order?
