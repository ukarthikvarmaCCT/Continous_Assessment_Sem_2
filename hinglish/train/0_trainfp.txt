 When Team India went to play series in Zimbabwe in 2001, there was a tear in his legs

 bhartiya janata party ne gujarat chunaav ke liye apni pehali list jari kar di he
 The names of a total of 70 candidates have been announced in this list released on Friday
 gujarat chunaav bijepi ke liye saakh kaa sawaal bana hua he, yahi kaaran he ki bijepi apana har pasa soch samaj kar daal rahi he
 The BJP has given 49 mlas a second chance in its list
 congress se aane vaale netaaon ko bhi tikat diya gaya he
 In its first list, BJP has taken full care of the caste equation
 padhein pehali list main kis jati se kitne ko tikat -patidaar - 15choudhary - 2thakor - 8coli - 5kshatriya - 6brahman - 2jain - 2iske alaava bijepi ne 4 mahilaon ko bhi tikat diya he
 It is worth noting that for some time, there have been agitations in the state regarding Patidar reservation
 andolan ke kaaran hi patidaar netaa hardik patel gujarat chunaav main ek ahm cheharaa ubhar kar aae hai
 Hardik Patel can support the Congress in the elections, which is why the BJP is taking its step forward with a lot of thinking about the Patidars
 gujarat chunaav: BJP ne jari kii pehali list, 70 naamon kaa kiya elaanis list main donon charnon ke liye thode-thode ummidavaaron ke naam hai
 These have brought such seats on which there was no scope for any dispute
 party ne pehle charan ke 58 ummidavaar, duusare charan ke 12 ummidavaar ghoshit kiye hai
 BJP has given tickets to many sitting mlas, as well as many leaders from Congress to BJP
 bijepi ne apni pehali list main congress se bijepi main aae raghav patel, raamji parmaar, maanasi chouhan, sike rauji ko tikat diya gaya he
 Significantly, the last date for nomination of 89 seats in the first phase of 19 districts in Gujarat is 21 November
 isliye bijepi ke paas abhi apane ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye samay he
 On the other hand, the last date for nomination of 93 seats of the second phase is 27 November
 gujarat: BJP kii pehali list main 70 main se 12 patidaar, congress se aae netaaon ko bhi mauka As soon as the monsoon session of Parliament begins, the opposition has also started attacking the government
 is satr kaa pehla bada hamalaa mayawati ne bolaa
 She targeted the government in the Rajya Sabha, so she was also angry with the Deputy Chairman for not doing the whole thing there
 mayawati naaraaz hokar rajyasabha se baahar chali gai or istipha dene kii baat kah di
 Bahujan Samaj Party supremo and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati's term in Rajya Sabha ends in April 2018
 pradesh kii vidhansabha main party ke paas itane aankade nahin hai ki 2018 main vah ek baar phir rajyasabha main pahunch sake
 In the 2007 elections to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the Bahujan Samaj Party got an absolute majority and the party's vote share was also more than 30 percent
 yah aankade pradesh kii raajnneeti main mayawati ke liye isliye ahm rahe kyonki unhen rajya main unke dalit vot bank ke alaava bhi agadi jatiyon se vot mila or vah pradesh kii sabase taqatvar mukhyamantri ke taur par satta par kabiz huin
 Also read: Being a Dalit candidate from both sides for the first time, due to Babasaheb and BSP: Mayawati passes a decade and the 2017 assembly elections completely reversed the arithmetic for Mayawati
 rajya vidhansabha kii 403 siton main unki party ko mahaj 19 siton par jeet darj hui
 Except for the seat, the burglary took place in his vote bank and BJP accounted for 84 percent of the Dalit seats
 saath hi dalit vot bank kaa 41 fisadi vot bhi bijepi ko mila
 Only one way now! There is only one option left for him to go to the Rajya Sabha again in 2018, to form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party
 aankadon ke mutabik donon dal ek saath milakar rajyasabha main do sadasyon ko bhej sakate hai
 But will Mayawati be ready to make this pact with her anti-samajwadi Party on the lines of RJD and JDU in Bihar
 gauratlab he ki yadi kisi surat main mayawati rajyasabha pahunchane ke liye yah kadam uthaati hai to iskaa kya asar ek saal baad 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav par pad saktaa he, kaa aankalan mayawati ko karnaa hoga
 These figures, changed in a decade, now pose a challenge to Mayawati to save her political existence
 jahaan 2018 main unhen ek baar phir apane liye rajyasabha main ek seat sunishchit kerani he, unki party is baar unhen sansad bhejne ke liye shashakt nahin he
 Political experts claim that if Mayawati does not get a place in the Rajya Sabha again after the completion of her Rajya Sabha term, it will not be easy for her to save her existence in politics
 dalit raashtrapati baba sahib kii dengauratlab he ki desh main nayaa raashtrapati chunane ke liye voting khatm ho chuki he
 This voting has been done in all the legislatures including the Parliament of the country
 muqabla endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind or vipaksh kii ummidavaar mira kumaar ke bich he
 As soon as voting began, BSP supremo Mayawati made a big statement that this is the first time that a Dalit candidate has been fielded from both the power and the opposition
 mayawati kaa maananaa he ki jeet yaa haar kisi kii bhi ho lekin unke liye badi baat yah he ki desh kaa aglaa raashtrapati dalit hi hoga
 However, with this statement, Mayawati also tried to give full credit to Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram for making it easier for Bahujan Samaj Party to save its credibility in politics
 lekin, is bayaan main mayawati kii majaburi bhi shaamil he ki jab desh main bijepi or congress donon ne dalit ummidavaar ko bataur raashtrapati pesh kiya he, aise main unke paas itane bhi aankade nahin he ki vah apane liye rajyasabha main ek seat sunishchit kar saken

 Actually, all the meetings of the Parliament Standing Committee are held in the Annexe of the Parliament House, but the view of this year's 13th and final meeting of the Standing Committee of the External Affairs Ministry of the Annexe was such that the eyes of the committee members were also shocked

 baithak ke bich main kai maukon par rahul or varun ke bich main yas, haa, thik baat he jaisaa samvaad hua
 But a special view came to light when in this meeting on Demand for Grant, Rahul suggested for empowerment of women that the Ministry of External Affairs fund is very low for medical and legal help of women who are in trouble after marriage to NRI
 , It should be increased quickly
 is par koi kuch kahata, usase pehle hi varun ne rahul kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki, 'bilkul sahi baat he, main bhi sahamat hum
 This should be done
 ye bahut acha suzav he
 'rahul came later and in the first two-and-a-half-hour meeting, Rahul stayed for one and a half hours and after that, Chairman Shashi Tharoor was asked to leave early, citing the necessary work, in a slip and left

 In fact, after Kejriwal jumped into the mud of politics, the identity of the entire family was reduced only around him or say that it was reduced in such a way that the entire family was injured due to the injury of politics
 yah dastaan bataati he ki kaise rajnatik satta apane pratidwandvi ke jakhmon ko kured-kured kar majaa leti he
 And how his fellow-sangati, who pretend to be fearless on the strength of power, force the opponent to live a despised life in society by the use of words
 kejariwal parivaar ke liye march 2014 se 10 farvari 2015 tak kaa yah aisa sach he, jo raajnneeti ko saaf-suthra banane kii sochane vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko diga saktaa he
 Kejriwal suffered all this during this period
 ye halaat 2011 ke anna andolan se lekar 14 farvari 2014 tak bilkul nahin the, jab kejariwal ne janalokapal ke mudde par istipha dekar dilli main apni sarkaar ko qurbaan kar diya tha
 At that time Kejriwal was just Arvind
 anna andolan ke baad raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke (aam aadmi party banane ke) baras bhar ke bheetar hi arvind ke dilli kaa siem banane kaa khushnuma ehsaas unke puure parivaar ko hua tha
 Son Appu became CM among his friends and daughter Bittu was the most promising among his friends
 maa-baap bhi fakhr se subah-shaam dilli se sate uttar pradesh ke gajiabad main kaushambi ke girnaar socity or aasapaas logon kaa abhivadan sweekaar karte
 In his village in Sirsa district of Haryana, he would proudly look at people and meet people
 unhen bete kii saadagi par garv jo tha
 His electoral victory for Arvind's wife was limited to struggles
 khud kejariwal bhi apane id-gird failte sansar ko apane tareeke se bhedane main hi lage rahe
 The passion to do something made him fearless but remained captive to the situation
 pehle dharna or phir lokapal ke sawaal par siem kii kursi ko chhodana yani jis teji se sangharsh ne satta dilaai, usee teji se satta tyaag kar sangharsh karne vaale halaat paidaa ho gaye
 For Delhi and for the country, the whole story of gaining political and political power from the movement and renunciation was from January 2011 to February 14, 2014, which was seen and understood by the whole country
 lekin 14 farvari 2014 se 10 farvari 2015 ke bich kaa sach dilli ke siem quarter se hote hue kaushambi ke girnaar socity kii chauthi manzil ke flats kii deevaaron ke baahar kabhi nikal na paaya
 At that time, the whole family had to bear the brunt of taunts from Delhi and everyone in the country to the neighbors
 saare raah fabtiyaan sunne ko milteen
 Even our own people do not miss the point of tightening their way of talking
 lihaaja, appu gumsum ho gaya
 Bittu got lost in books
 patni ne khud ko samet liya
 It became a compulsion for parents to bow their eyes
 jis desh main kursi se chipke rahanaa taqatvar hone kii nishaani mana jaataa he, vahaan kejariwal ne janata ke mudde ke liye siem kii kursi chhod di to aparaadh kar diya! balaatkaar ke maamalon main police kii niskriyata ke virodh main dharna diya to aparaadh kar diya!is ehsaas ko baras bhar jaise kejariwal parivaar ne jiya, use traasadee kaha jaae yaa raajnneeti kaa paath

 In the boundary of the government flat of Girnar Society, everyone became suspicious of Kejriwal's movement
 dilli chunaav kii lagaataar deree ne parivaar ko khamoshi se jehar pinaa sikhaaya to chunaav ke elaan ke baad khud ko sabit karne ke sangharsh main samoochaa parivaar jute gaya
 The painting descended from the wall of the room and a map of Delhi was hung in its place
 vidhansabha kii sattar siton ko bhedati aadi-tirchhi rekhaaen sangharsh kii moti lakeer main badal gai
 If the dream of winning Delhi becomes the yardstick of living life, then what Bittu and what Appu, elderly parents, dream of walking with eyes open for everyone became Delhi elections
 dilli chunaav ke liye sakriy sirf kejariwal najar aate lekin parivaar khamosh sangharsh main shaamil tha
 So, on the day of the results, on 10 February, when Kejriwal held the mike in his hand and said to the lost workers in the victory on the road, "this is my wife Sunita hai", the shock of pain and tragedy broke, which has been around for years
 Was taking the family test

 After April, now is the time when your salary will also increase and you will also get a promotion
 pramotion milane ke baad kai karmchaariyon ke vyavhaar main badlaav aa jaataa he or ve apane kaam par dhyaan dena kam kar dete hai
 After getting promotion, employees become a bit careless and make some mistakes
 aaie jaanate hai pramotion milane ke baad koun-koun si galtiyaan karne se bachanaa chahie
 Do not avoid the team, remember that your team also contributes to the promotion that has been received
 bina team kii mehnat ke aapaki safalataa mumkeen nahin he
 So do not try to avoid the team during work
 saath hi khud ko badha-chadha kar pesh naa karen
 These questions are asked in interviews with freshers, give answers like this
 
 
 naa bane laaparvaazksar log pramotion milane ke baad thode laaparvaah ho jate hai
 They feel that now the promotion has been done, even if the performance is a little less then it will not make much difference
 par ek baat yaad rakhen pramotion milane ke saath aapaki jimmedaariyaan or target bhi badhate hai
 So take office work more seriously than before
 agar aap aisa nahin karenge to aap apane lakshya par kabhi nahin pahunch paaenge
 Don't be overconfident, don't forget that promotion has been received for your good work
 pramotion milane ke baad overconfident naa bane
 Do not put your hand in every office work
 aapako jitna kaam saunpa gaya he use sahi samay par den
 Do not try to show the boss after promotion that you can do everything
 overconfident ke chakkar main aapaki ek galati aapako baari nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai 
 Imagine these 7 things to do better in the office
 It is a good thing to be proud of your achievements, but it is harmful for you to let it climb on your head
 isliye bhuulakar bhi apni kamyaabi ko apane upar naa chadhane den
 Do not sit in the midst of your employees
 kisi ke kaam ko chota naa samajheoxsar aisa dekha gaya he ki pramotion milane ke baad log apane juniurs ke kaamon ko chota samajhate hai
 They also speak well and bad during work
 lekin aap ye naa bhi bhoolen ki kabhi naa kabhi aapane bhi kaam kii shuruuaat chote pad se hi kii thi

 The BJP has increased its demand this time, offering to contest 135 of the 288 seats in the state assembly, which has been turned down by the Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ko is baat se avgat kara chuke hai ki vah aaj shaam tak is baat kaa faisla kar le ki kya vah 'aapasi sahmati evam sammajanak dhang se' seat bantwaare ke formula ko apnaane ke liye sahamat hai
 This ultimatum of BJP has come in the backdrop of Amit Shah's two-day conversation in Kolhapur, Maharashtra this morning
 is baatcheet main kaha gaya ki atmasamman kii keemat par koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 Top BJP sources said that the party was upset that the Shiv Sena, which had been an ally for 25 years, did not react to its proposal to contest more seats this time
 varsh 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne 119 or shivasena ne 169 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 However, this time the base of the alliance Mahayuti has increased as four other parties RPI (athawale), Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, Swabhimani Shetkari Paksha and Loksangram have joined it
 bhaajapa sutron ne kaha ki party uddhav ke uttar kii pratiksha kar rahi thi or usne nirnay kiya ki apni sthiti spasht kar di jaye kyonki samay niklaa ja rahaa he
 The party is particularly upset that since the demand for 135 seats has been made by Uddhav, he has neither responded nor communicated with the BJP leadership
 vastav main bhaajapa kii maang kaa sidhe koi uttar die bina thakare ne is saptaah ke shuru main saarvajanik taur par ise khaarij kar diya
 BJP sources said that they are keen on an alliance but the party cannot wait for eternity
 koi nirnay kiya janaa chahie kyonki gathbandhan ke seat bantwaaraa formule ke aadhaar par hi ranneeti taiyaar kii jaaegi
 a detailed discussion was held between the bjp's core group in Mumbai last night before this ultimatum was given by the party today

 After the historic victory in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal addressed party workers from Patel Nagar office
 unhone kaha ki jab aap sachche raste par chalate hai to brahmad kii sari shaktiyaan aapaki madad karti hai
 He addressed from the balcony of the party office along with his wife, father and senior AAP leaders and during this time thousands of activists chanted 'five years, Kejriwal'
 unhone AAP kaaryakartaaon or vidhayakon se kisi bhi keemat par ahankaar na karne kii naseehat di
 He said, 'this situation of BJP and Congress has happened due to Congress only
 agar ham log ahankaar karenge to paanch saal baad janata hamen bhi sabak sikhayegi
 'read, Kejriwal's entire speech, the people of Delhi have really done wonders
 ye logon kii jeet he
 This is a victory of truth
 hamaare paas to kuch bhi nahin tha
 Neither do we have money
 na hamaare paas sansaadhan hai
 But as i always speak
 ham log sachai ke raste par chale
 When you walk on the path of truth, all the powers of this world, all the powers of the universe, help you
 aaj jo nattejey aae

 This is his victory
 lekin dar bhi lag rahaa he
 It's Very Scary
 jitna bada bahumat dilli kii janata ne hamen diya he
 i would like to make one request to all activists, to all mlas, to the entire party
 jaraa sa bhi ahankaar mat karnaa
 The condition of Congress today
 wo unke ahankaar kii vajah se hua
 Which is the condition of BJP
 wo unke ahankaar kii vajah se hua
 If we are arrogant, this is the lesson the public will teach us after five years
 hamen haath jodakar sab logon kii seva kerani he
 i can't do anything alone
 main bahut chota aadmi hum
 We can build such a city with the people of Delhi
 jis par garib or amir donon garv karenge
 She is my wife ye kabhi bhi saamne nahin aati
 Because they work in the government
 ek dar laga rahata he
 (5 years slogan of Kejriwal
 patni haath jodakar logon ke saamne aati hai
 ) Somewhere the government should not take action against them
 main inhen aaj khinchakar le aayaa
 i said, do not be afraid, the government will not take any action
 doston, jo bhi main mehnat karata hum
 She would not have been possible without them
 ye mere pita ji hai
 The blessings of our elders and the sacrifice and support of our family is very important for whatever we are doing
 aap sabakaa bahut bahut shukriya
 Long live Mother India

 Sudha Vyas of Thatti village is always standing near her house that was destroyed in the flood of Dharmaganga
 kedarnath kii budhakedaar ghati main based unke is gaanv main ab koi ghar sabut nahin he
 She wants to convey her grief to the commuters
 budhakedaar bazaar main dharmganga or balganga nadiyon ke sangam se 50 meter dur budhakedaar-jhaalaa pinswad road ke kinare hi 17 june tak sudhaa kaa aath kamaron kaa makaan tha
 This house was given by his brother due to his poor financial condition
 ab vakt kii maar ne ek baar phir sudhaa ko sadak par laa diya he
 His house was swept away in the flood, all the items kept in the house were also washed away
 baadh jab angan tak aa gai, tab bhi kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki unka ashiana ujadgaye vaala he
 Now Sudha has been mumbling continuously, "even if we don't get compensation, the government should just give us money to build two rooms worth of land and houses
" ham to kiraaya bhi nahin de sakate
 "this is the condition of the families whose houses have been completely washed away by floods or are no longer viable to live
" tehri jile ke bhilangna vikaas khand kii balganga ghati ko tehri riyasat ke samay tehri raja kii duusari rajdhani ke naam se janaa jaataa tha

 lekin saal-dar-saal aa rahi aapadaa ne logon ko jhakzor diya he
 In the old market itself, more than 15 houses have become flooded due to floods, out of which seven houses have been destroyed
 budhakedaar ke gram pradhan sundarnath kehete hai, ‘‘is aapadaa ne puure gaanv ko barbaad kar diya he
 Along with houses, farming has also suffered a lot
 100 pariwaron kii kareeb 200 naalee se adhik khadi fasal or kheton kaa naamo-nishaan nahin bachaa
 All the water mills for milling in the village were washed away
 ’’ thati gaanv ke hi manmohan singh ravat kehete hai, ‘‘aapadaa ke din dm, esadm, tehseeldaar or 108 apatkaaleen seva tak ko phone kiya tha, lekin 8 dinon tak koi nahin aayaa
 There has been a lot of damage in the raffle, ddoli, dunla and ghanali stakes of the Thati-oldkhedar gram panchayat
 logon ke khet, chhaani, makaan sab bah gaye hai
 More than two dozen families of the village have taken shelter in the homes of other families in the village
 ’’aaj jahaan dharmganga kii baadh ne tabai machaai he, kabhi vah un gharon se 50 meter duuri par gaanv ke kinare se bahati thi
 There were lush green fields between the village and the river, which has now turned into a sand field
 lokajeevan vikaas bharti ke sangrakshak or saamaajik kaaryakarta bihari bhai kehete hai, ‘‘is nadi kaa aisa raudra rup pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 But all this is the result of the activities continuously increased by man in the river valleys
 ’’ iskaa sabase zyada khamiyaja sthaneey log hi jhel rahe hai
 Natthilal had sold all his fields and built a four-room house on the roadside
 lekin jaise hi ghar main chat padi, prakruti ne apana kaam kar diya
 Now there was no field left with Natthilal and neither his home was able to be built
 natthilal kehete hai, ‘‘mere paas ab kuch bhi nahin bachaa he
 Was selling all the fields and building houses
 ab vah bhi nahin bachaa
 i used to live in another's house earlier also
 ab shaayad kabhi apana makaan nahin ho paaegaa
 Natthilal lives on the basis of wages
 jagadehi kii kahani bhi isse alag nahin he

 Most people are those who want to work in the party

 However, with great effort, India's Pragyesh Gunniswaran, who reached for the first time in a Grand Slam singles match, closed his path on the very first day of the Australian Open on 14 January, or else to watch the match of Indian cricket's 'fighter' Rafael Nadal in the same city
 Gone, why don't they even watch him match! In memory of Indian cricketers and Indian Diwans who have connected cricket with their identity Enrichment Cricket Ground will be recorded forever
 dua kiijie ki australian cricketer is maidan ko manahuus yaa nasudha vagairah na maan len
 Such wounds, however, slowly heal
 mumkin he, yahaan aane par unke jakhmon par or namak pade
 But they should learn from the seagull birds of this field, who forget the victory and defeat in moments like thunderstorms and all other worldly wars, and take a new flight with freshness on the second day
 un bhale-bhole parindo ne australian open main us din bhi bura nahin mana jab guuruuvaar der raat prabandhakon ne ek match ke dauraan kaha ki open ground par seagal kii beet faili hui he or viman singles kii khilaadi gabareen muguruja or johaan konta kahen to use das minute main saaf karavaaya jaae
 But both of them considered it appropriate to play on the ground with the roof covered even after midnight
 haar-jeet to khayr aani-jaani he
 Cricket and its inner spirit must remain so

 That strange moment Vijendra Shekhawat still remembers with full details - "I and Mahima Mehra, now my business partners, went to Amer Fort for the first time together
" ekaek unhone pakadakar ek kadam peeche khinch liya
 Actually there was a high pile of elephant dung in front
 ''jaipur se hi sate or 1596 main raja maan singh ke banawaye is kile main hathi bahutayat main hai or uski sawari yahaan ke pramukh aakarshanon main se ek he
 In such a situation, it is not surprising to see a pile of elephant droppings here and there
 is badboodaar dher par apana paanv padane se to unhone bachaa liya lekin handmad paper kaa chota-sa kaarobaar karne vaale shekhavat ko isamen ek kaarobaar kii ek acchhee-khaasi sambhaavna dikhi
 He thought why not use it as a raw material to make paper
 jin parichiton-jaankaron ke saamne vijendra ne is tarah kii raay jataai, unhone ise paagalpan qaraar diya
 But what other people probably did not know about Shekhawat was this: that the amount of fiber in the elephant scab is very high
 ve bataate hai, ''hathi kaa pachan tantra reshon ko bahut acchhee tarah nahin pachaa paata
 In this way, there is a lot of scope for preparing pulp required for making paper in its droppings
 hathi aisa jaanavar he jo apane khaae hue kaa 40 fisadi hissaa hi pachaa paata he
 "the recycled lead is now recycled by Shekhawat and Mehra, who are making paper of the brand of Elephant Imprint, which is also sold and exported from 40 shops across the country
" 2011-12 main unhen isse kul 35 lakh ru
 The arrival of ve hathi chhap card, notebook, thile, photo elbum or kai tarah ke sajaavati saamaan bhi banaate hai
 Today every metro city has shops of this brand and the highest demand comes from Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai
 company kii shuruyaat 2004 main hui
 But elephant ride was not so easy
 vijendra kehete hai, ''mahima ke alaava har kisi ne meri khilli udayi
 My mother burst into thinking that Leed was brought home
 unka kahana tha ki is peshey kii vajah se koi ladki mujhse shaadi karne ko taiyaar na hogi
 "collecting elephant dung is a difficult task
 iske liye bahut kam majdoor apana haath ganda karne ko taiyaar hote hai
 It is then disinfected or germ-free and is used to assess whether it will produce the pulp of the quality necessary to make paper
 shekhavat ne kaagaj banane ke liye sahi tarika istemaal karne se pehle maheenon tak prayog kiye the
 Listen to his opinion, "it is not that i had any special affection for elephant droppings
 prayog maine duusari chizon ko lekar bhi kiye
 Used the fibrous parts of the cavernous stems
 sajaavati kaagaj banane ke liye resham ke dhaagon kaa istemaal karne kii koshish kii
 But none of this worked
 magar hathi kii lid kaa prayog kargar rahaa
 Vijender also persuaded his family by removing religious affiliation from elephants
 kya kaha, suniye jaraah ''maine unase kaha ki hindu dharm main sabase pehle puuje jane vaale devtaa ganesh kaa sir hathi kaa he to bhala hathi kii lid ko apavitra kaise mana ja saktaa he
 i told him that there is a class of Brahmins who consider elephant dung sacred
 ''aaj ve sab mushkilen kaaphi peeche chhot gai hai
 His wife (yes, he did not have any problem in getting a suitable spouse) is actively involved in his work
 unke bhai bhi is kaam main madad karte hai
 It is still a cottage industry, in which Shekhawat has hired just three people to heat, clean and prune the dung
 baaki kaam ve khud apni patni or bhai ke saath milakar karte hai
 Vijendra himself goes out every morning to collect the lead
 isaki gunvattta ko sudhaarney ke liye ve khud hi hathi maalikon ko hare chaare kii aapurti karte hai
 For every 1,000 kg of lead, about 150 kg of pulp is prepared
 company ke liye vitaran kaa zyaadaatar kaam sambhaal raheen shekhavat kii saajheedaar mehara kahati hai, ''handmad paper udyog ke mere pichley anubhav se hathi chhap brands ko sthapit karne main kaaphi madad mili
 She says that it was difficult to establish the brand in the first few years, but there was phenomenal growth in revenue after 2007-08
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''2010 ke aasapaas tak hamaare alaava shaayad hi aisi koi company thi jo handmad paper kaa bade paimaane par utpaadan karti ho, isliye iskaa bazaar bahut chota tha
 Improvement in socio-economic conditions and the entry of many new players in the region helped to increase demand
 ''haalanki, na to shekhavat or na hi mehara is project ko zyada bada rup dene kii icchhuk hai
 "we don't like to go to them because of the kind of demand that big retailers make," says Mehra
 kabhi-kabhi hamaari aapurti main deree hoti he, khaskar barish ke mausam main jab pulp ko sookhne main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 The merchants we supply to it have no problem
 '' vijendra bhi is baat se sahamat hai, ''mujhe lagata he ki hamaare kaarobaar kii paraspar sahyog kii jo prakruti he, vahi isko tikaoo banaae hue he

 Coming from the film background, Rani is known for her cuteness and acting skills
 beti adira ke janm ke baad se hi rani film insdetry se dur hai
 In the India Today program, Rani said that she is planning another baby
 rani mukherjee film 'hitchkee' se bollywood main kambek kar rahi hai
 During an interview, when asked if she never asked her husband Aditya to cast her for a film, Rani's answer was - no
 rani ne kaha, main aditya se jab bhi baat karti hum to kisi film ke liye nahin balki duusare bachche kii planning kii baat karti hum
 Rani said that after Adira she now wants a second child
 PHOTOS aakhir bahan rani mukherjee se milane pahunchi kajolhal main rani ko airport par kaaphi kool luk main spot kiya gaya
 This style of Rani was quite glamorous away from the movies
 rani ne ledar jacket ke saath blike tii-shart, blue jeens, sporti snikers or Louis Vuitton kaa bag kairi kiya tha
 This style of Rani really makes her a Bollywood diva
 vaise aapako bataa den ki rani jacket kii keemat jaanakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 Rani's jacket is priced at Rs 1 lakh 30 thousand, which she bought from British fashion brand Belstaff
 padmavati par boleen rani mukherjee- pyaar se rahen, nafrat naa faillaayembta den ki india today ke conklev main najar ain rani mukherjee ne nepotism, padmavati vivaad or apane filmi kariyar ke bare main khulkar baaten kin
 On the Padmavati controversy, Rani Mukherjee said, "we should live in society with love
" maanavtaa ko pyaar kii bhashaa bolni chahie or aisa kuch bhi nahin karnaa chahie jisase sosayadi main nafrat faile
 i like to live with love bhansaali ko rani ke samarthan kii jarurat nahin he

 If a woman is burnt alive after an attempted rape at the police station, then some MLA ruins the house of a poor Beva and somewhere the extortionist threatens the life of the village head
 upi main samaajwaad kaa sunaharaa sapana kab toote hue shishon kii manind awam kii ankhon main chubhane laga
 No one knows when the law-makers, while protecting the law, will start to crush the law under their boots, and then it came a matter of time that the CM of the state had to show the mirror to his leaders
 siem ke aaine main chamak hoti to soobe ke halaat kab ke badal chuke hote
 In Barabanki, a woman arrived at the police station in an illegitimate manner with the intention of freeing her husband

 a poor widow wept on one side watching a bulldozer move in front of her eyes on a made-in-the-tin, and on the other, the entire area resonated with the atax of the drunken mlas
 uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot main samaajawaadee party ke do vidhayakon vir singh patel or ram singh par ekagarib vidhwaaka ghar ujaadne kaa aarope he
 According to the victim woman, the goons of both the mlas suddenly surrounded her house on Tuesday
 isse pehle vah kuch samaj paati, pehle to use khinch kar ghar se baahar nikaala or phir buldozer se usee kii ankhon ke saamne uskaa ghar matiamet kar diya
 She kept screaming, screaming and begging for mercy, but the law-making legislators themselves continued to render a poor widow homeless
 40 saalon se ek jagah par rah rahi ek akeli mahila se aslhon ke dam par ek adad chat bhi chin lee gai
 After a lot of run-off, the police registered a report on the woman's complaint, but after that the threat she received was about to make a hue
 vidhayak ke gurgon ne kaha ki agar usne police main kii gai apni shikaayat waapas nahin lee, to agali baar use jinda jala diya jayega
 Where everyone can see the world from the lawmakers to the safeguards of the law with all the spectacles of power, who can also expect justice? jab is silsile patrakaron ne jile kii dm sahiba se sawaal kiya to unhone na sirf lage hathvidhayakonke haq main faisla sunaaya balki yah kah diya ki agar maamla sattadhari dal se judaa hota to katai exiaar hi darj nahin hoti

 vah pichley vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee janata party ke ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav maidan main the or mahaj 2000 voton ke antar se chunaav haar gaye the
 The interesting thing is that these three generations of Chandrasekhar family are seeking votes in their name in the entire Ballia region
 teenon peediyaan apane postaron main chandrashekhar kii tasveeron kaa istemaal kar rahi hai
 Ballia has eight assembly seats
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ne aath main se chah siton par kabja jamaaya tha jabik do siten sapa ke khate main gai thim

 basapa ne jin vartmaan vidhayakon ke tikat kaate hai unamem se do ko congress ne ummidavaar banaaya he to teen nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav maidan main hai
 The SP seems to be in a good position here, but the alliance of the Rajbhars' Bharatiya Samaj Party and the Qaumi Ekta Dal can harm it
 bhaajapa ekmaatr seat bairiyaan main acchhee sthiti main dikh rahi he
 From here, Bharat Singh, who was a minister in Kalyan Singh cabinet, faces Mukteshwar Singh of BSP and Suresh Tiwari of Congress
 tiwari ne pichley chunaav main basapa ke tikat se yahaan chunaav jeeta tha lekin basapa se tikat na milane par is baar vah congress ke tikat par chunaav maidan main hai

 kaumi ekta dal ke raamji gupta sapa ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane hue hai
 The BSP has cut the ticket of sitting MLA Ghuraram from the adjacent Rasada assembly seat
 basapa ne yahaan se uma shankar singh ko tikat diya he jabaki ghuraa ram nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main maidan main hai
 SP has reposed trust in Sanatan Pandey here
 bhaajapa ke ramikabal singh bhi basapa or sapa ke ummidavaar ko yahaan takkar dete dikh rahe hai
 In this Rajbhar-dominated seat, Taramani Rajbhar of the Bharatiya Samaj Party is trying his luck, while the Congress has fielded Babbanrajbhar
 chandrashekhar dwaara gathit sajapa ne sikandarpur se parvej ikbaal ansaari ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 He is also engaged in crossing the electoral waters with the help of Chandrasekhar's name
 gyaat ho ki chandrashekhar jab desh ke pradhanmantri bane the, us samay sajapa kaa jabardast prabhaav tha or uske lagbhag 58 ummidavaar chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche the
 At present, members of his own family are joining political parties with the help of Chandrashekhar's name
 rasda ke rajesh singh ne bataaya, 'chandrashekhar jab jinda the tab unhen har jati va dharm ke logon kaa samarthan miltaa tha lekin ab unke bete or parivaar ke anya sadasyon ko lekar vah baat nahin hai
 Voters are now divided according to their convenience
 ' sthaneey patrkaar pramod upaadhyaay ne kaha, 'kshetra ke adhikansh log chandrashekhar se lagaav hone ke chalate niraj ke saath hai lekin unamem vah baat nahin he jo chandrashekhar main thi
 He has influence in two to three seats which can go to the account of SP

 The current indo-french talks over the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France have been in trouble due to offset provision and changes in weapons technology
 raksha sutron ne bataaya ki ek badi baadha ofaset provijan he jis par bharat dabaav daal rahaa he, lekin is par france kaa kahana he ki isse vimaan kii keemat bad jaaegi

 The second issue is that the Air Force is demanding some special changes to Rafale, so that certain weapons can be put into it, while France has offered other changes
 isse bhi keemat bad jaaegi
 The comments sutron ne kaha, 'jab se misr or katar ke saath qaraar hue hai tab se hi daam ke liye pehle se nirdhaarit maapdand hai
 The aircraft for India cannot be cheaper than the price at which the other two countries have bought the aircraft
