 The release of rjd's Bahubali leader Shahabuddin on the Grand Alliance in Bihar has started showing side effects
 jail se jamaanat par unke reeha hone ke baad se hi rajya main siyaasi bayaanbaji shuru ho gai he
 Interestingly, after the opposition, now the arrows of the statements have started moving inside the Grand Alliance

 shahabuddin or raghuvansh prasad singh se sidhe bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko chunauti dene vaala bayaan diya he
 'let me tell you that Shahabuddin said that Nitish Kumaran is neither his leader nor Awam after he was released from jail
 jabaki raghuvansh prasad singh ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan ne nitish kumaar ko netaa chunaav he, lekin wo vyaktigat rup se unhen pasand nahi karte

 ye baat samaj main nahin aa rahi he ki aakhir wo aisa kyon kar rahe hai
 However, he in a way supported Shahabuddin's statement and said, 'after 11 years Shahabuddin has come out of jail, the leader will speak
 party main wo mujhe netaa maanata he to kya galat he
 But yes, it is also true that the leader of the grand alliance is Nitish Kumar
 'shahabuddin ne nitish kumaar par talkh tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki wo maas ke netaa nahin hai
 Interestingly, Lalu Prasad did not give any direct answer to this
 unhone kaha, 'kisi ke kehane se koi maas kaa netaa nahin hoga
 'there is a ruckus in the media,' he said, referring to the ongoing rhetoric in the alliance
 lalu ne kaha ki humlog mil baithkar baat karenge

 According to the police, the accused is married
 vah do bacchon kaa pita bhi he
 At present, the police is investigating the case by filing a case against the family members of the victim
 "yah jeet daraati he, ise sir par mat chadhane dena!'' dilli kii adbhut jeet ke baad arvind kejariwal ne yah baat sochakar nahin kahi hogi
 It is a spontaneous middle-class reaction that arises out of the possibility of something going bad on getting a big success
 dar chaahe kitna nakaaratmak ho lekin uski apni takat hoti he
 There are always some deep fears in the political world that form the foundation of strategies
 kejariwal kaa dar jaij he
 They have not just got a positive mandate from their part
 ek taaja lahar se ub va ufanti ummiido ne unhen jokhim kii chotii par taang diya he
 Kejriwal alone is not scared by this, fear is also on the other side
 do saal tak thapede khaane or ragadne ke baad antat: nai siyasat puri thasak ke saath satta ke shikhar tak aa hi gai
 Traditional politics was afraid of this
 raajnneeti kii bahason se pare ek teesraa dar bhi he
 People now want to realize how frightened Kejriwal is by corrupt models of governance and politics
 darasal, dar kitne bhi bura hon, mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main kejariwal kii aamad ke baad desh kii raajnneeti kism-kism ke pratispardhi daron se hi gunthi-buni hogi, jo kai badlaavon kii raah kholegaa
 Why should Kejriwal be afraid? Because he does not have to run a government but to form a new government
 bharat main sarkarein khub chalin lekin nai gavarnence kaa intjaar khatm nahin hua
 Governments were reduced from this election to that election, so the difference between politics and governance continued to blur
 kejariwal ateet nahin ponch sakate, ve ek nai gavarnence kii ummid ke saath shuru hue the, andolan va siyasat jiske madhyam bane
 Even after coming to power, old politics could not be free from political urges, in the same way Kejriwal could not be free from agitational urges in the 49-day old experiment
 ummid he ki ve badale honge
 The lessons he learned will also include the lesson that it is not difficult to devise new ways within the existing boundaries of governance
 aam aadmi party ko darana chahie ki uskaa bhavy janadesh nai va kamjor jameen par tikaa he
 Politics is intangible, governance touches life
 yah janadesh siyasat karne kaa nahin, sarkaar chalaane kaa he
 The roots of traditional political parties are nourished by ideologies, tradition, family and geographical expansion, so they thrive again despite electoral defeats
 kejariwal ke paas aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 They stand at the pinnacle of expectations, facing powerful and competitive politics
 kejariwal ko yah dar vaaki mahasoos hona chahie ki bas ek galati hui to punarmushakobhav!kejariwal se kise darana chahie?2011 kaa disambar yaad kariye jab lokapal par sansad main bahes chal rahi thi
 The mainstream of politics Surma was roaring that all paths of change pass through the hallway of traditional politics
 jise badlaav chahie, use daleey raajnneeti ke daldal main utar kar do-do haath karne honge
 Kejriwal has expressed his denial of the traditional design of politics not once but twice through party and electoral politics
 kejariwal haal ke dashakon main bharat ke sabase tape hue netaa hai jo syaahi kii bauchhaar or janata se pitate hue, jamini andolanon kii paripati ke jariye abhootpurv jeet tak aae hai
 Kejriwal's grand victory marks the beginning of the Modi era in Indian politics and the Congress's disappearance
 is viraat jeet ko modi kii lokapriyata ke shor ke bich badi khamoshi ke saath gadha gaya he
 The old parties should be afraid of Kejriwal because this start up of politics is starting with tremendous public investment
 kejariwal ke paas sarkaar kii simaaon ke bheetar rah kar vah paardarshee gavarnence gadhane kaa prachand bahumat he, puraani raajnneeti jise rokatii rahi he
 Kejriwal's fear should always remain that he may shorten the line of traditional politics
 kejariwal kaa dar kaisaa hona chahie?dilli kii aam charchaaen yah kahati hai ki kejariwal ke pehle 49 din bhrashtachar ko daraane vaale the
 Whether or not the outbreak of corruption was reduced, no evidence is found, but personal stories and experiences of the people show that there was definitely a strong hope of reducing corruption
 isi ummid ne aam aadmi party ko vaapasi kaa aadhaar diya
 All products in India are expensive because their price includes cut-commission costs
 tamaam skool sirf isliye moti fees vasuulate hai kyonki unhen kholane va chalaane kii ek avaidh laagat he
 In developing countries, corruption increases the cost of projects by 20 percent and adds strength to inflation
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping bhrashtachar rokane ke liye dar paidaa kar rahe hai kyonki unhen logon ke gusse se dar lagata he
 If Kejriwal is able to create fear against corruption, many of his works will be completed automatically
 janata maaf karnaa jaanati he isliye to satta chhodane ke baad, dilli main makaan tak na dene vaale logon ne kejariwal ko 67 siten de deen
 But the public now decides immediately, it does not wait for five years, it also punishes on the first occasion
 kejariwal pratispardhi raajnneeti va behad besabr voter se mukhaatib hai, jo netaaon ko daraa kar rakhana chahta he taaki ve hameshaa vah karen jo unhone kaha he
 You can call this voter sadist or ruthless, but what will the public do, Janardan
 use murkh samajhane kii bajaae usase darate rahane main hi samajhadaari he
 Thankfully, there has been evidence of increasing this understanding among Indian leaders
 dilli main deshi sharaab mahangi ho gai he
 The price of each bottle has increased by ten rupees
 vahiin, angreji sharaab kii license policy main bhi cabinet ne badlaav kiya he
 Country liquor has become expensive in Delhi
 cabinet ne somvaar ko apni meeting main isaki ijaajat de di
 License rules will also be tightened for the sale of beer, rum and whiskey

 ) In the capital Delhi, there is panic of sealing nowadays
 pehlekhan marketsor ab ceiling kaa jinn aakhirkaar lodi road ke mehrchand market tak ja pahunchaa
 From Wednesday morning, under the supervision of the Monitoring Committee of the Supreme Court, the process of sealing started in Meherchand Market
 avaidh nirmaan ke khilaaf kahin dukanencilki gayi to kahin seedhiyaan hi sil kar di gayi
 About 135 shops were sealed in this market with more than 150 shops
 sabase zyada ection un dukaanon par hua, jinhone basament or apper floor ke saath chhedchhad kii
 Two banks also came under the grip of the sealing drive
 dena bank or state bank of india ko apana kaamkaaj sametane ke liye kuch dinon kaa samay diya gaya he
 As soon as the ceiling started, there was chaos among the shopkeepers
 ceiling dasta police dalbal ke saath pahunchaa lihaaja dukandaaron kaa gussa kisi kaam nahin aayaa or tamaam dukaane, jinamein praparty kaa galat tareeke se istemaal kiya gaya tha, use sil kar diya gaya
 Now the shopkeepers are upset and asking questions that if they have done any illegal construction to increase their business then why is the whole shop being sealed
 kaarobaar bandi ke dauraan kya unke ghar kaa kharch sarkaar degi
 According to Ashok Sakhuja, President of Meherchand Market Association, the redevelopment plan of this entire market has been ready for many years
 phir bhi abhi tak is par koi karrwai nahin hui
 We have no objection to the ceiling, but tell the MCD what its officials were doing when the property was tampered with or misused
 agar ection dukaanon par ho rahaa he to phir un afasaron par bhi ho jinhone aisa hone diya
 The ruling BJP is also under pressure from the ceiling in the MCD
 party kaa kor voter bijness class hi he or ceiling kii vajah se wo emsidi se behad naaraaz he
 The BJP is blaming the Delhi government for the ceiling and is soon to meet the monitoring committee of the Supreme Court to provide relief to the shopkeepers
 dilli sarkaar ne bhi elaan kiya he ki wo ceiling ke mudde par 15 janvari ke baad vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaaegi
 All the shopkeepers who came under ceiling could be given some relief
 supreme court main canvarjan charge or ceiling ke mudde par 12 janvari ko sunwaayee hogi
 If there is no relief to the shopkeepers from here, then after January 16, large-scale sealing is sure to happen in the whole of Delhi
 purv raashtrapati pratibhadevi singh patil phir vivaadon main hai
 This time the dispute is on his demand in which he had asked the Central Government to pay fuel bills, provide government car and also allow the use of private car
 bhatte ko lekar vivadaniyamon ke anusaar purv raashtrapati apni gaadi kaam main lete hai to idhan bhatta le sakate hai
 And if they do not, then they can use the government car
 lekin unhone sarkaar gaadi ke istemaal ke saath hi eendhan bill bharne or saath hi privet gaadi kaa istemaal karne kii bhi anumati dene ko kaha tha
 Not like the first car, the case started with the withdrawal of the first official train from former President Patil
 kyonki yah gaadi unhen pasand nahin ai thi
 After this, the former president demanded a big car but if it was not allowed, he asked for fuel allowance
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kii aapattiiske baad unke daftar ne personal car kaa upyog karnaa shuru kar diya or jab vah pune se baahar jaati to jila prashasan ne unhen sarkari gaadi muhaiyaa karai
 When the Maharashtra government came to know about this, they objected to it and took up the matter with the Center

 When she was president, her son and former MLA have also faced similar allegations

 Interestingly, Radio Bundelkhand is located in Orchha in Madhya Pradesh, but due to UP being adjacent to Jhansi, people here are also taking advantage of it

 In 2002 the government set a policy to establish community radios of educational institutions
 is niti ko 2006 main enjio yaa anya sansthaanon ke liye bhi lagu kar diya gaya
 Under this, operators can install a maximum antenna up to 30 meters high and a transmitter of up to 100 watts of effective radiative capacity

 multistarar film saaho relies ke saath hi musiibat main funs gai he
 The scene in a song from the film has been accused by Bangalore Contemporary Artist Shilo Shiv Suleman of stealing his artwork
 ab unke saport main actress lija re ne bhi jamkar saaho ke mekars ko fatkaar lagaai he
 Lisa shared the original artwork on her Instagram account and a photo of that scene from Saaho's song
 is photo ke saath unhone lanbaa choda post likhakar is kaam ko galat bataaya he
 He wrote, "what is creativity? What is art? Where does it come from? We know what it is not? This is not your social status
 ye aapkaa job tital nahin he
 This is not your appearance
 "view this post on instagramwhat is creativity? What is art? Where does it come from? We know what it is not
 It's not your social status
 It’s not your job title
 It's not your appearance
 It’s not even the image you see in the mirror
 Creativity and its sister Art reach us from the sweet spot of the universe- the soul you might say- through mystery
 But i do know that the creator- artist is the channel for it
 Let me tell you how hard it is to birth anything original or authentic
 i personally labored for years over my book, quelled the doubts and noise from others and didn’t emerge until i had almost undone myself
 Because it's a calling
 And when i was moving through dark spaces of self-doubt or hitting creative blocks, i would turn to the work that @shiloshivsuleman puts out into the world and shares on her Instagram handle for inspiration
 i can recognize when a creator works honourably and deeply, bleeding, sacrificing, unsleeping, stretching herself in the direction of emotional bravery to produce work that births those feelings we all look for in day to day life
 To feel inspired
 To feel alive
 That’s why when something dishonorable happens, we need to stand up and speak up
 To hold up a mirror to these makers to make them understand THIS IS NOT RIGHT
 It’s come to light that a big budget film production has ripped off one of Shilo’s original creations
 This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft
 In no world, is this acceptable
 The production did not contact the creator, ask her permission nor offer to collaborate or offer a credit
 Nothing
 This is not right
 i believed the Hindi film industry was evolving necessarily past stealing storylines and rampant plagiarism but the producers of Shahoo have obviously not gotten the memo when it comes to art
 Here's the thing- Creators are worthy of worship
 What they produce are more lasting and precious so than all the other ‘things’ we accumulate that can be taken away
 Let's hold these producers accountable for their infuriating, dishonourable action
 How would you feel if a thief slid into your home and took away your most prized possessions? Your heart
 Your soul
 And your livelihood

 Lisa wrote resentful of Saaho's makers saying that this was a sheer theft

 He wrote that what the creator creates is long lasting and valuable

 The entire nation is eyeing Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee today
 dada ke munh se aaj sansad main niklaa ek-ek shabd puure saal aam aadmi kii jindagi par asar daalega
 Know the personality of Pranab Mukherjee
 kaale chashme ke bheetar chamakati in ankhon ne hindustan kii raajnneeti ke paanch dashakon kaa itihaas dekha he
 The name of the living document of five decades of Indian politics is Pranab Kumar Mukherjee
 siyaasi galiyaaron main log badi izzat ke saath inhen dada kehete hai
 One of the oldest Congress leaders, and the Congress troubleshooter
 
 
 
 Pranab da pranab da apane kariyar main saatvin baar desh kaa aam bajet pesh karne ja rahe hai
 Simplicity is the hallmark of Pranab da, either a kurta dhoti or a turtleneck Prince suit on the body
 pipe pine ke khaase shaukeen
 Although it is very simple nature, but sometimes they get angry too
 pashchim bengal main veerbhum jile ke kirnahar ke paas 11 disambar 1935 ko pranab mukherjee kaa janm hua
 Father Kamada Kinker Mukherjee was an old Congressman and freedom fighter
 lekin pranab babu kolkata uniwarsity se itihaas, raajnneeti shaastra main eme or kanoon kii degree lene ke baad shikshak ban gaye
 If i do not feel like advocating for a few days and then tried my luck as a journalist too
 60 ke dashak main wo congress main shaamil hue or 1969 main rajyasabha pahunch gaye
 Due to his loyalty and honesty, Pranab Mukherjee climbed the stairs of success
 1973 main pehali baar pranab mukherjee kendriya audyogic vikaas vibhaag ke upamantri bane
 In 1982, Pranab Mukherjee became the country's Finance Minister for the first time
 1984 main euromany patrika ke survey main unhen duniya ke sarvshereshth vitt mantri kaa khitaab mila
 Indira Gandhi had great faith in Pranab Mukherjee, he was among the closest leaders of Indira Gandhi, but when Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister of the country, Pranab da's height did not appeal to many in the Congress itself
 halaat kuch aise bane ki dada ko congress se baahar bhi hona padaa
 He formed his own party called the National Socialist Congress, but in 1989, after Rajiv Gandhi's persuasion, Dada returned to the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ke nidhan ke baad pranab dada desh ke pradhanmantri pad ke sabase majboot daavedaar the, lekin sameekaran kuch aise baithe ki pivi narsimharav pradhanmantri
 P

 Narasimha Rao gave Pranab Dada the responsibility of foreign minister in 1995

 landan kii patrika imarging markets ne pranab mukherjee ko 2010 main asia ke sarvshereshth vitt mantri ke taur par shumaar kiya
 Pranab Mukherjee is a veteran, he is 76 years old
 desh kii mitti or janata kii jaruraton ko samajhate hai
 He also has an idea of the flight of development and the ground reality
 kai baar unhone apane anubhav kaa loha manvaaya he
 The people of the country hope that while presenting the budget, Pranab da will take good care of their feelings and their needs
 simon katich ko australia ke anubandhit khilaadiyon kii suchi se baahar karne ke faisle kaa bhale hi kai purv khilaadiyon ne virodh kiya ho, lekin ian chapel kaa maananaa he ki yah vyavhaarik faisla he
 Chappell wrote in his column in the Daily Telegraph, was it correct to remove Katich? Not at all from Katich's point of view, but from the point of view of the selectors, they cannot think of any player's emotion
 yadi aisa karenge, to kabhi kathin faisle nahin le sakenge or naa hi apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam de paaenge
 He said, this decision of the selectors is practical
 unhen ek jagah khaali kerani thi or sheershakram se hi kisi ko hataaya ja saktaa tha
 Chappell said the reason for excluding Katich would not have been his age, but the fitness problems of last year
 unhone in rapaton ko khaarij kiya ki maujuuda captain maaikel clark kaa is faisle se koi sarokaar rahaa hoga
 He said, no cricket captain who imposes his choice or choice will last long
 jise pataa ho ki uske naam darj hone vaali jeet yaa haar khilaadiyon ke chayan par nirbhar hoti he, vahi acha captain he

 The special thing of this time Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh is that the voters of many parliamentary constituencies are angry with their local mps, but they get confused when it comes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, these seats include Ghosi parliamentary seat
 
 ghosi sansadeey seat par vaise to mukhya ladaai bhartiya janata party ke maujuuda saansad harinarayan rajbhar or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke sanyukt ummidavaar atul raay ke bich hoti najar aa rahi he, lekin basapa se baghawat kar congress kaa daaman thamkar chunavi maidan main utre baalkrishna chouhan ne mukaable ko dilachasp bana diya he
 Balakrishna Chauhan had contested the last Lok Sabha election on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket, but after alliance with Samajwadi Party, the BSP got this seat and made Atul Kumar Singh alias Atul Rai a candidate
 basapa ke is faisle se naaraaz hokar baalkrishna chouhan party se baghawat kar congress kaa daaman thamte hue chunavi ranbhumi main utar gaye or unke maidan main aane se gathbandhan kii raah mushkil hoti dikh rahi he
 The coalition is facing dual difficulties

 At the same time, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has given ticket to the party's national secretary Atul Kumar Singh alias Atul Anjan

 At the same time, BJP is also hopeful of victory in the name of nationalism
 haalanki sipiai ummidavaar atul anjaan kaa kahana he ki rashtrawaad ke naam par yahaan vot nahin padane ja rahaa
 Regarding the SP-BSP alliance, Atul Anjan of the CPI says that it is a vote-only alliance
 basapa ke ummidavaar atul mafia hai, or un par kai tarah ke aapraadhik cese chal rahe hai
 He is currently absconding in the rape case
 vahiin bijepi ke ummidavaar harinarayan rajbhar ke bare main vah kehete hai ki vah to apane kshetra main behad kam hi dikhte hai
 He has not done any development work

 Talking about Ghosi seat, the SP-BSP alliance is more likely to win here too
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki ladaai joardaar he or jeet chaahe kisi ko bhi mili, lekin haar-jeet kaa antar zyada nahin rahane vaala
 There are several important issues in Ghosi, including poverty, unemployment, poor condition of farmers, running of closed mills, over bridge and setting up of marketing centers for weavers
 rashtriya lokdal ke pradesh pravaktaa anshuman singh kehete hai ki kshetra main kisi tarah kaa vikaas kaary nahin hua
 The situation of the farmers is in bad shape
 yuva berozegaar gum rahe hai
 The condition of roads here has been fixed, but in other areas the government has failed
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan bhale hi apane ummidavaar par cese chalane ke kaaran tension main ho, lekin jatigat sameekaran uske paksh main najar aa rahaa he
 In the absence of Atul Rai, the son of his close and Bahubali MLA Mukhtar Ansari has taken the command of the campaign in his hands
 aise main gathbandhan pratyaashee agar dalit, yadav, muslim or bhoomihaar voton ko ekajute karne main safal rahete hai to modi kaa jaadu yahaan feekaa pad saktaa he
 However, BJP candidate Harinarayan Rajbhar is in the race to reach Parliament once again with his caste and upper caste vote

 Not many people attended Prime Minister Modi's meeting
 vahiin basapa pramukh mayawati kii raily kii baat karen to vahaan par mahaj 100-200 mahilaayein hi shaamil hui
 Anshuman Singh also says that there is no such thing as Modi wave in the area
 atul anjaan bhi kehete hai ki saansad harinarayan ne kuch kaam nahin kiya he
 The BJP, a stronghold of the Left, won a historic victory in Ghosi seat in the Modi wave in 2014, when party candidate Harinarayan Rajbhar opened an account for his party by defeating bsp's Dara Singh Chauhan
 daara singh 2 saal pehle basapa chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue hai

 Harinarayan won this election with a margin of 1,46,015 votes

 1957 se ab tak 16 baar hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko 4 baar jeet mili, jabaki sipiai ne 5 baar jeet hasil kii he

 Of these 5 assembly seats, 3 are occupied by BJP, while 2 are won by BSP
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad ghosi sansadeey seat par chunaav behad dilachasp ho gaya he
 Coalition candidate Atul Rai is facing a rape case and is said to be absconding, but his position is still strong due to the alliance

 yah kanoon patniyon ko chhodkar bhaag jane vaale patiyon ko bharat waapas laane kaa ek saadhan bana
 "the passport suspension cancels all the visas of a person and deprives him of all the legal grounds of living on foreign soil," says Kabiraj, who has been continuously pushing for action from Indian embassies abroad
 ʼʼchunki in ladakiyon ke paas sansadhano kii kami thi, isliye kabiraj ne shikayaton kii prakriya puri karne ko lekar prashikshan ke alaava inhen kaam karne kii ek jagah or telephone helpline bhi muhaiyaa karai he
 "every case requires a file of at least 80-100 pages, and these girls have handled the task with the same passion and anxiety as a fish shows for water," he says
 ʼʼnahin ke baraabar vetan par kaam karne vaali or kiraye ke gharon main rahakar maamuli bajet par kaam karne vaali ladkiyaan apane jaisi duusari peeditaaon kii sahaayta ke liye bahut samarpit hokar kaam karti hai

 30 year old Rupinder Kaur from Amritsar is an MBA
 2015 main otawa ke ek canadai naagarik se unki shaadi hui thi lekin pati saat din baad hi bhaag gaya
 "so far, we have helped people suspend 75 passports," says Rupinder
 ʼʼ 16 anya filein bhi hai, jin par punjab yaa haryana police kii ore se elosi kii pratiyon kii pratiksha he
 Apart from this, there are many other cases related to fugitive NRI husbands who have gone to Australia, Canada, USA, New Zealand, Italy, Spain, Germany and UK, whose files are being prepared
 rina kaa kahana he ki peediton ko kagaji kaary main sahaayta dene ke alaava, yah cell unke liye paraamarsh centre ke rup main bhi kaam karata he
 She says, "girls feel that they have a place where they are heard sympathetically and helped
" ʼʼ chunki yahaan sahaayta karne vaale bhi us dard se guzar rahe hai or unki bhi apni dukhad vyathaa he isliye sahanubhuti kaa rishta swatah kaayam ho jaataa he
 The Punjab Police's NRI wing in Mohali, adjacent to Chandigarh, investigates the cases of these abandoned juveniles
 punjab main is samasya kii gambhirtha kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yah bharat kaa iklauta aisa rajya he jahaan ke jilon main 15 enarai police stesan hai or amritsar, jalandhar, ludhiana tathaa patiala main sahaayak mahanireekshak (eiji) rank ke adhikari tainaat hai
 It is the first state to have an NRI Commission headed by a retired High Court judge
 par jaanch behad thakaaoo or samay khapau he
 Ishwar Singh, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), who is heading this wing, says it is because the accused suddenly disappear and are not aware of where they are staying abroad
 mushkilon ke baavjood, enarai wing ne 2016 se 624 elosi jari kiye hai or 324 enarai tathaa videshi passport dharak bharatiyon ko pio ghoshit kiya he
 Apart from this, it has also issued 91 summons through police and courts in other countries
 haalanki, ishwar singh maanate hai ki kaary kii gati kuch dhimi he par ve isaki vajah aise maamalon kii baadh ko maanate hai
 Amrit complains that the staff at NRI police stations are slow and are often not sensitive to the problems of the victims
 amrit kahati hai, ‘‘ve hafton tak elosi kii pratiyaan dene main bhi yah kehete hue anakani karte hai ki yah ek gopneey dastavej he, jise keval sakasham adhikari ko hi diya ja saktaa he
 ʼʼ This means that the accused often finds an easy means of escape
 udhar fatehgarh sahib kii amarinder cor kaa maamla dekhie, jinhone enarai wing ko yah bataaya bhi tha ki aaropee ne italy ke liye work vija ke navinikaran kii prakriya shuru kara di he, phir bhi unhen elosi kii prati nahin di gai
 "if Italian immigration officials had been alerted in time, his Italian visa would not have been extended," says Amarinder
 ʼʼdilli ke passport daftar ne bhi is varsh saat passport nilambit kiye, lekin peediton kaa kahana he ki yahaan karrwai karne main sakriyata nahin dikhaai jaati
 Insiders say that most of the officers do not want to get involved in such cases because their court proceedings last for years and they have to make rounds of the court
 dilli kii rahane vaali ek peedita smita kudasia, jo ki Togetherwecan kaa hissaa hai, kahati hai, ‘‘aarpeo dilli main, hameshaa susti dikhaata he or hameshaa yahi bahaanaa karata he ki passport ko nirast karne kii prakriya bahut jatil he
 कु Kudasia, who runs the group's blog, also says that Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has been "misinformed" that now passport suspension in all passport offices takes place smoothly
 ʼʼyah sthiti 2017 main sthapit ek nau sadasyeey videsh mantralay kii samiti kii siforeeshon ke baavjood he
 Retired judge Arvind
 goyal kii adhyakshata main panel ne kai badlaavon kii salaah di, jisamen desh chhodkar bhaage patiyon ke khilaaf elosi jari karne or passporton ko jabt karne sahit kai badlaavon ke suzav die gaye
 Based on this, the government set up an Integrated Nodal Agency (INA) headed by WCD Secretary Rakesh Srivastava, which also includes representatives from the ministries of foreign and home, to speed up the process of such cases and track such fugitives
 
 haalanki, chandigarh ko chhodkar jameen par or kahin bahut kaam nahin ho rahaa he
 Cases have been registered against absconding husbands under non-bailable sections 498 (a), 420, 406 and 120 (b) of the Indian Penal Code, despite its authorities not issuing locs in most cases
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki aise passporton ko nirast karne ko lekar kendriya kanoon mantralay or mahila or bal kalyaan mantralay ke bich samanvay or mataiky nahin he
 Earlier, the Law Ministry had also objected to the proposal of the Ministry of External Affairs to post information of summons issued against NRI grooms on the website
 videsh mantralay kai prastaavon par kaam kar rahaa he, jisamen passport adhinium main ek sanshodhan bhi shaamil he, jo aise enarai, jo nirdhaarit avadhi ke bheetar apni shaadi panjikrut karne main vifal rahete hai, unke passporton ko nilambit karne kii ijaajat detaa he
 a proposal to compulsorily include wife details on NRI husband's passport is also being considered
 haalanki punjab main 2012 (haryana main 2007 se hi) main hi vivaah kaa panjikaran anivaary bana diya gaya he, lekin ise karyanvit karnaa asambhav he
 Chandigarh-based family law expert Anil Malhotra says, "until the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and other religious personal laws are amended, the registration of a marriage has little meaning
" ʼʼ togetherwecan jaise prayaas pareshaaniyon se juujhati mahilaon ke liye sarkaar se samaadhaan nahin balki parivartan kii maang kar rahe hai
 Kudasia and others have prepared a set of proposals which, if implemented, will be a matter of times past in marriage to nris where women have to stumble over their rights

 kendriya mantri hegade ne kaha, 'unhen saboot chahie, musalmaan kaa betaa (rajeev gandhi) kaise brahman ho gaya, uskaa koi subut denge ye log? musalmaan baap or videshi isai maa se paidaa hua ye insaan (rahul gandhi) kaise brahman ho gaya kya iskaa subut denge?'iske saath hi unhone kaha, 'main majaak nahin kar rahaa
 Speaking on record, when Rajiv Gandhi died, he was asked to do a DNA test for identification
 us vakt rahul gandhi kaa diene lene kii baat hui thi to sonia ne manaa kar diya
 And said that let's test Priyanka Gandhi's DNA
 ab sach kya he, aap sabko to pataa hi he or ye log hamase pruf maang rahe hai, in logon kii haisiyat hi nahin he ki ye hamase subut maangen
 'let us tell you, Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde made a similar statement in January, he told Congress President Rahul Gandhi of' mixed race ', how can a' Muslim 'father and Christian mother's son be a Brahmin 
 unhone rafel saude par narendra modi sarkaar (modi Govt) ko nishaanaa banane ko lekar bhi rahul gandhi par hamalaa bolaa
 Addressing a program in Uttara Kannada district, Hegde said, '
 
 
 unhen dharm kii koi samaj nahin he
 See how much they lie, father is Muslim, mother is Christian, son is Brahmin
 yah kaise hua?' gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, ‘aap duniya kii kisi prayogshaala main aisi mishrit nasl nahin bana sakate, yah hamaare desh kii congress prayogshaala main hi uplabdh he
 ' shaadi karne ke pehle ham vyakti, paisa or khandaan dekhte hai
 But in reality, all these are not needed in a true relationship
 lekin kai baar aisa hota he ki ham partner ke pyaar main itnaa pad jate hai ki kai jaruri chizon ko bhi nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 Let's know what those things are that you should know before marriage
 1
 It is very important for the partner to be mentally prepared
 pataa kar len kahin aapkaa partner mata-pita yaa kisi or dabaav main to shaadi nahin kar rahaa he
 Does love really increase weight? Know what the study says hone vaale pati kii naukari ke bare main sahi jaankaree honi bahut aavashyak he
 Many times one should not believe just by saying
 naukari hi nahin, sahi selary kii jaankaree bhi aapako honi chahie
 3
 partner se is tarah ke sawaal bhi kar lene chahie ki shaadi ke baad ve alag rahanaa pasand karenge yaa family ke saath
 After marriage, if you do not want them to put any pressure on you, then it would be better to know the answer to these questions
 apane partner kaa test lene ke liye jarur karen ye ek kaam4
 If the spouse does not work, ask about their investment and financial status
 pataa lagaaein kahin ve kisi or par nirbhar to nahin
 5
 apane hone vaale partner kii pasand or naapsand ko jaanane kii koshish karen
 You may have a habit or preference that you absolutely dislike
 aisi chijen aage chalakar jhagade kaa kaaran banati hai
 6
 shaadi se pehle hi jaan len ki aapkaa saathi family planning ke bare main kya sochataa he
 It is very important to know when and how much children are to do
 pehle se jaankaree hogi to aap khud ko maansik rup se taiyaar kar sakenge

 ek meter tak dekh paanaa mushkil ho gaya tha or aise main subah 5 baje gaadi drive karnaa, jaise jaan hatheli par lekar daftar jane se kam na tha

 Surgical strike 18-19 times during my time, yet no applause Former Minister of State for Defense Jitendra Singh has said that i myself have been the Minister of State of this department and 18-19 surgical strikes took place during my time too, but we did not beat Dhindora

 aaie aaj aapaki mulaakaat un manzaron se karaate hai, un tasveeron ko aapke saamne laate hai jinhen dekhnaa bhi aap gavaara nahin karenge
 But what to do, sir, they are constantly visible around us and you
 in sabake bich bas ek hi baat kehane kaa dil chahta he ki apane vatan ko is desh ko hindustan hi rahane dijie
 Do not make Lynchistan
 kyonki is puure planet arth par sirf yahi mulk vaahid aisa mulk he jisane puure sansar ko vasudev, kutumb-bakam kaa sandesh diya he
 There is noise inside the Parliament, so are everyone silent outside? Issues are being counted inside, so is there a solution to the issue outside? This is India, but hardly any of us would like to see such a picture of India
 or ye bhartiya hai
 But inside India, hardly any of us want to suffer the consequences like these Indians

 Yes, this mob is lynching
 jab ek bheed chaaron taraf se kisi ko gher le or bich main fanse hue insaan ko log baari-baari se laat, ghunson, ballam, lathi or pattharon se nishaanaa bana rahe hon to ise mob linchig hi kaha jaataa he
 But from what we have seen till now, the attack on the crowd is always on him who is so vigorous and agile that he should not be in the bus of any one and a half people
 jaise kisi sher ko gher lenaa
 But this is not the scene
 is bheed main fanse is shaks ko dekhiye
 It seems forced
 iske paas to apane bachaav ke liye hathiyaar chhodie kuch bhi nahin he
 Take a look at these pictures in turn
 sab bebas, majaboor, laachaar hi nazar aa rahe hai
 Now if you are calling it mob lynching then think again, think because here only a few people are being targeted in the guise of tom lynching
 haa, ye bhi sahi he ki aisi do-chaar ghatnaon se koi nateeja nikaalnaa samajhadaari nahin maani ja sakati
 But when two or four dozen such incidents happen, then it is not wise to remain silent
 hamen ise samajhnaa hoga or jaldi samajhnaa hoga
 Because when every window is closed

 That too when Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the question of Rajiv Dhawan, a lawyer for the Muslim side
 CJI ne poocha tha ki kya aap hamaare sawaalon se santusht hai? isi par adaalat main hansi gunji
 What happened on Monday? Actually, during the hearing on Monday, the lawyer of the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan raised many questions in the court, he told the Supreme Court that you only ask questions from the Muslim side, there are less questions from the Hindu side
 
 supreme court main somvaar ko jab rajeev dhawan kii ore se ye sawaal kiye gaye to supreme court ne kuch nahin kaha tha, sirf sunwaayee ko aage badhane diya
 However, objections were then raised from the Hindu side

 Even though there was a contest between the Congress and the BJP in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, counting of votes was done, but the party workers have not only formed the Congress government but also demanded that their leaders be made cms
 mangalvaar ko jaise hi rujhaanon main congress aage ai party kaaryakartaaon ne pradesh congress daftar kaa rukh kar liya
 But the thing that caught everyone's attention was that of supporters telling their leader the face of CM
 congress main kamalnath samarthakon ne ek din pehle unke siem banane kaa poster lagaae the to matganana vaale din sindhiya samarthakon ne unke bade- bade katout laga die or unke siem banane ke liye jamkar narebaaji kii

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne janata dal united (JDU) ke rashtriya adhyaksh par ek baar phir teen varsh ke liye buudhvaar ko apana doosraa kaarykaal shuru kiya
 Speaking on the occasion in Delhi's Mavalankar Hall, Nitish Kumar said that the prohibition of alcoholism was successful and said that the people who are saying that it is a failure are actually the same people who are drinking alcohol secretly
 sharabbandi par nitish kumaar ke daavon ko chunauti dete hue vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne unpar ek nahin kai aarope lagaae or chunauti di ki mujhe giraftaar kar len
 Tejashwi said in his statement that i am saying that liquor mafia makes a beating in Nitish Kumar's house
 mukhyamantri ke saath rahane vaale log sharaab pite hai
 After this, Tejashwi said that someone in the Bihar Police should arrest Mai Ka Lal? Asked by these shameless and corrupt mandate dacoits, how many mafia have been born out of CM housing due to liquor ban? According to Tejashwi, Nitish Kumar has banned liquor to raise party fund and RCP tax? To send the poor to jail and to make the police corrupt and unacceptable, liquor ban has been done
 iske baad unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ne kaanoon-vyavastha bigaadane ke kiye sharabbandi kii he
 Tell the Chief Minister that despite the recovery of crores of liters of liquor, why not a single senior officer was dismissed, but one and a half lakh people went to jail? According to Tejashwi, if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told that this program was successful, why amended it many times to make the liquor ban law relaxed? Chief Minister, lakhs of your party workers have become liquor mafia
 sharaab kii taskari karte hai
 So you have done this to give them illegal employment
 kya aapako hosh he abtak aapke kitne log isamen pakade gaye or turant chhudaaye gaye hai? aapke netaaon ke sharaab pite video viral hue hai or aapaki nikammi, bhrasht police aapke bhrasht shashan kii pole kholane vaale vipakshi kaaryakartaaon ko pakad rahi he
 You have been sitting in a horoscope for 15 years, yet your poor police gun does not work

 He said that it is better to focus on the opposition workers and handle the deteriorating law and order
 saath hi unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar aapmen or aapaki police main dam he to mujhe giraftaar karo naa? main saream kah rahaa hum aap sharabmafia ko sangrakshan dete hai unhen apane swaarth ke liye paalate hai

 ’ Janshatabdi Express caught fire in flooded area of bihar on Wednesday morning
 aag lagane se jaan-maal kii koi haani ke nuksaan kii abhi tak koi khabar nahin he
 It is being told that this fire was caused due to brake binding in Janshatabdi Express
 aag lagane ke baad yatriyon main afra tafari much gai thi, jiske baad vahaan mokama stesan par kareeb aadhe ghante tak train khadi rahi he
 However, after this the technical team was called and the train was dispatched
 janshatabdi express haavda ja rahi thi, jis dauraan uski asi bogi main aag lag gai
 Let us tell you that 'brake binding' is a technical problem in which the brake gets jammed, causing friction, fire and smoke
 haal hi ke dinon main is prakaar kii kai ghatnaayen dekhne ko mili hai, jahaan brake binding ke kaaran train main aag lagi ho yaa achaanak dhuaan uthanaa shuru ho gaya ho
 On February 2, another major accident occurred due to fire in Mumbai

 jin niveshkon ne kam jokhim vaali yojanaon main paisa lagaaya tha, unhen apane nivesh par milane vaale ritern main pichley kuch varshon se lagaataar kaaphi giravat dekhne ko mili he, chaahe vah public pravident fund (pipief) ho, neshnal sevings certificate (enessi) ho, kisaan vikaas patr (kevipi) ho, post offis manthali inakam skim ho yaa bainkon main saavadhi athwa aavarti jamaa
 Unlike the early years of 2000, when the interest rate on small savings used to be in the double ten, it is now around 8 per cent
 2011 se choti bachat yojanaon par byaaj kii daron ko sarkari baandon se jod diya gaya he
 Currently only 7 in 15 years PPF account
 6 pratishat kaa byaaj mil rahaa he or enessi par bhi itnaa hi byaaj mil rahaa he jabaki kevipi par 7
 It is only 3 percent
 sukanya samruddhi yojana (balikaon ke liye) or senior citigens sevings yojanaayen apekshaakrit zyada aakarshak hai, jinamein kramshah 8
 1 percent and 8
 3 pratishat byaaj mil rahaa he lekin ye yojanaayen kuch hi virgon ke liye hai
 Banks are getting interest on fds around 7 per cent, but after tax cuts, the real profit is reduced even more
 mahangaai lagaataar jis tarah bad rahi he, use dekhte hue choti bachat yojanaon se ritairement kaa koi surakshit bajet nahin banaaya ja saktaa he, or na hi beemaari yaa bacchon kii shiksha aadi kaa kharch uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Aiyar, chief investment officer and head (product), Kotak Mutual Fund, says, "if one wants the confidence of profit, then the traditional small schemes are right for them
 par unamem sirf sthayitv ke alaava or kuch bhi nahin rah gaya he
 However, in the last few months, the repo rate from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is 0
 25 tak badha die jane ke baad byaaj daron main kuch vruddhi hui he
 If you are not satisfied with the benefits of investing in your small savings schemes and want to increase your profit without taking much risk, then what is your option? In the investment world, one scheme is rarely suitable for all people
 isliye aapako yah baat apane dimag main baitha leni chahie ki adhik laabh lenaa he to thodaa-bahut jokhim uthaanaa hoga
 Here are some options that can give you more benefits than small savings schemes
 date fund se surakshaset (rin) fund sarkari pratibhutiyon or anya rin pratibhutiyon main nivesh karte hai jinaki credit reating swatantra credit reating agenciyon kii najar main kaaphi upar hoti he
 The risk of default in these securities is very low
 yahaan die ja rahe rin fund main jokhim kam or nivesh par laabh milane kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Fixed maturity plans (fmps) are better than bank fds because they have higher fixed rates of interest
 emmempi asal main close-anded date fund hote hai jo tregeri bill, commercial papers, jamaa pramaan-patron, sarkari or korporate baandon jaisi yojanaon main nivesh karte hai
 You can only invest in FMP at the time of release of new fund
 nivesh kii gai rakam emmempi kii avadhi tak ke liye lock ho jaati he
 You can sell your FMP in the secondary market before maturity, but liquidity is generally low
 teen saal se adhik avadhi vaale emmempi main puunjigat prapti par soochikaran (indexeshan) laabh miltaa he or aapaki tex kii dendaree bahut kam ho jaati he
 Hybrid funds: These are a mixture of debt and equity
 hybrid funds main date kaa ooncha laabh miltaa he or ye tex ke lihaaj se bhi kifayati hai
 Brijesh Parnami, CEO and executive director of Essel Wealth Services, says, "typically 75-90 percent of investment in traditional hybrid funds is invested in debt-related schemes
 jo niveshak maujuuda bazaar main jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahate, unke liye ye acha vikalp hai
 Traditional hybrid funds can be bought and sold like mutual funds
 chunki equity kaa hissaa 65 pratishat se kam hota he, isliye tex ke uddeshyon se inhen date funds ke samaan samajha jaataa he—alp avadhi ke puunjigat laabh par vyakti ke slab dar par tex lagaaya jaataa he or deergh avadhi ke puunjigat laabh (teen saal se adhik) par indexeshan laabh ke saath 20 pratishat
 These funds are a good option for new investors who want to invest less in equity
 share bazaar main giravat ke dauraan in funds kaa sabase acha laabh rahata he
 Equity Savings Fund: Equity generally offers higher returns over the long term
 isliye umr, jokhim uthaane kii kshamta or nivesh kii avadhi ke aadhaar par niveshkon ko equity main nivesh karnaa chahie
 In the hybrid category, equity savings funds invest 65 per cent of their capital in equity and equity related schemes and 10 per cent in debt
 hejing or date main expoger se inamen jokhim kam rahata he
 These are open-ended schemes
 ayyar ke mutabik, ''bazaar kii asthirataa ko dekhte hue pehali baar nivesh kar rahe log bhi equity sevings funds par vichaar kar sakate hai
 "in terms of tax, they are treated the same as equity funds: Rs
 1 lakh
 se upar ke deergh avadhi ke puunjigat laabh par 10 pratishat kaa tex lagaaya jaataa he
 Strengthen the Retirement Fund: a large portion of your pension fund goes into the Provident Fund (EPF) but the interest in it for many (8 in FY 2017-18)
 55 pratishat) miltaa he, vah equity main nivesh kii apeksha kam aakarshak lag saktaa he
 In view of the long-term benefits of equity, managers of EPF and National Pension Scheme (NPS) have been forced to allow some part of your contribution to equity
 amplise pravident fund orgenigeshan (ipiefo) aapke yogadan kaa 15 pratishat equity main nivesh karata he
 NPS customers can regularly invest money in a pension account during their working years
 ve ritairement ke samay is raashi kaa 60 pratishat nikaal sakate hai or bachi rakam kaa istemaal anyuty yojana kharidne main kar sakate hai taaki ritairement ke baad niyamit aay paa saken
 The income received through annuity is taxed at the slab rate of the person
 aap aath pension fund manageron main se chunaav kar sakate hai
 "NPS is a very convenient and flexible way to make money," says Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities
 ''enpies aapke portpholio ko dizin karne main lacheelaapan detaa he jo aapaki jokhim uthaane kii kshamta, apane yogadan ko equity, rin or sarkari bands main baantne kii haisiyat par nirbhar karata he
 The maximum investment allowed in equity is 50 percent
 enpies par milane vaala laabh bazaar se judaa he
 But investing money in equity helps in avoiding inflation and it becomes a better option than investing in debt schemes
 enpies funds 60 varsh kii umr tak lock ho jate hai
 But some parts can also be taken out during emergencies

 In response to a question from a student of Aligarh Muslim University, the Fatwa Department of Deoband has said that Islam does not allow such ceremonies as they are against Sharia
 yah sawaal vishvavidhyalay ke sansthaapak sar sayed ahamed khan ke janmdin samaaroh ke sandarbh main poocha gaya tha
 Deoband Vice Chancellor Maulana Abul Qasim Naumani said, 'muslims should not follow the Western tradition of celebrating birthdays as they are against Sharia
 ’ a press release written in harsh words has caused a hatred between the Indian Army and the Government of Himachal Pradesh

 It included 48 of the army at Anandale, 4 km from Shimla

 "the state government is intent on destroying the remaining forests, and all this is being done under the auspices of the land mafia, which aims to make huge profits," the communique says
 ''mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal is vijyapti par ukhd gaye hai or unhone sena par manahani kaa mukadmaa thokane kii dhamkee di he

" mukhyamantri is baat se bhi naaraaz hai ki is vivaad main sena ne unke saansad bete anuraag thakur ko bhi lapetane kii koshish kii he
 Being the president of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, Thakur spearheaded the campaign to build the stadium here

 On April 7, 14 sports federations based in Shimla supported the stadium

 The Army has put a question mark on the proposal to construct the stadium
 vijyapti kahati he, ''anandel sena ke liye ahm samrik sthal he jise nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "there is currently a fence on the ground
" yahaan sena kaa paharaa he
 On 16 April, citizens raised slogans, mostly from the sports federations, against the army for "illegally seizing land"
 thakur ke mutabik, ''rajya ko is jameen kii jarurat kai gatividhiyon ke liye he
 The army can use it to land helicopters in case of emergency
 ''dhumal ko sena ke daavon par bharosa nahin
 According to him, in 2002, the state government offered 25 acres of land to the army at Ghandal village, 8 km from Anandale
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''sena is prastaav par nau saal tak baithi rahi or phir ise khaarij kar diya
 Anandale is worth thousands of crores

 The army is also not ready to retreat

 Amitabh Bachchan is not just an artist in the Indian film industry, but he is also recognized as an advocate of Hindi
 unhone abhinay ke shikhar par pahunchane ke liye jitani mashkkat kii, usee tarah se unhone is udyog main hindi ko maan dilaane ke liye bhi kaam kiya he
 Even today, through reality game shows like Kaun Banega Crorepati, they are contributing in promoting such words of Hindi which the new generation is not able to pronounce correctly - amazing
 aisa bhi nahin he ki amitabh hindi ke iklaute pairokaar hai
 But it is true that they look like big lines in this case
 unke saath hi hindi kaa prachaar karne waalon main shatrughna sinha, raaj babbar or mithun chakravarti kaa naam bhi shumaar he
 Inspired by this, this caravan has moved forward and today we also see many artists like Aamir Khan, Manoj Bajpayee, Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Mishra and Pankaj Tripathi
 yah sach he ki hindi filmon se roti khaane vaale is udyog ke adhikansh log angreji main khate, sote or jinda rahete hai
 The scripts, dialogues, song writing for a Hindi film and gestures for the artist to act on behalf of the director are also in English and Roman
 hindi filmon kaa sansar mumbai main he or yahaan mahanagareey sabhyataa main isaki apni hindi bhi he jisamen angreji ko maamuli sa sthaan miltaa he
 But in the stream of time, the English word Bollywood has established its home very fast and this word has made the Hindi cinema a sanskrit mundan in such a way that from paper to mouth, the same word sounds like Gilori Paan
 haalanki, is shabd ne bhi hindi cinema ke samandar main hichkole tab se lenaa shuru kar diya tha jab sattar ke dashak main amitabh bachchan abhinay ke shikhar par badi teji se bad rahe the
 Indian cinema was also in its modern period and commercial cinema was in its youth
 amitabh ke saath lekhan main saleem-javed kii jodi thi or hidustani hindi cinema kii chamak ko badha rahi thi
 Amitabh is an artist from the Hindi belt and he also has the Hindi culture of Babuji (mahakavi Harivansh Rai Bachchan)
 baavjood iske ek kalakaar ke taur par unhone hindi filmon main hindi ko ek aatma kii tarah mahasoos kiya he
 That is when he was asked why Abhishek Bachchan's son, the son of megastar Amitabh Bachchan, is not showing the same height as his career? In response, he looked like both a father and an artist
 unhone kaha tha ki hindi cinema main aapako hindi kii aatma main ghusna jaruri he tabhi aap darshakon ke dilo-dimag par chhaaenge
 According to the new age, the English are not giving up the pursuit of Abhishek, which will cause them to get out
 abhishek main abhinay kala kii koi kami nahin he or sirf amitabh bachchan ke bete hone se safalataa nahin mil sakati
 Amitabh, who is very caring about his son, has always opposed the word Bollywood, which threatens the culture of Hindi cinema
 ve bollywood shabd sunanaa pasand nahin karte hai or hindi main zyada se zyada baat karte hai
 He says that the Bollywood word for Hindi cinema is not right
 kyonki yah angreji ke pet se janma shabd he jisamen hindi kii aatma nahin he
 Films are made in Hindi in Mumbai and we already exist in Indian cinema and Hindi cinema, so why should we consider English Bollywood
 bombai or hollywood ke wood shabd ko jodakar bane bollywood shabd ko amitabh ke saath kai kalakaar or filmkaar sweekaar nahin karte hai
 But English teeth are using this word indiscriminately
 hindi ke pairokaar amitabh ab angreji ke rahanumaon ko selfi ke liye hindi shabd par manthan karke bhi jawaab dene lage hai
 He has coined the Hindi word for selfie and that is - vada cum usach i
e
 self produced self portrait with personal telephonic device
 ise un logon ko istemaal karnaa chahie jo bollywood shabd ke diwane hai

 Without naming him, he called him 'super CM'

 In its reply to the Supreme Court, the Center said that this decision of the top court is only natural in the current situation
 sarkaar ne kaha ki 46 blox main se kuch abhi chaalu hai or kuch jald hi shuru ho jaaenge
 This decision will be taken care of in their allocation
 kendra sarkaar ne supreme court se apil kii thi ki jin companiyon ko kol blox aavantit kiye gaye the, court unki baat sune bina aavanton radd na kare
 The Center has said in the court that these 46 coal blocks can be given to Coal India or a fresh allocation process can be started like in 2-G case
 supreme court ne 1993 se 2010 tak screening cameti dwaara kiye gaye 218 kol blox ke aavanton ko gaiyrkanoonee qaraar diya tha
 The court said in its judgment that the allocation was done arbitrarily and transparency was not taken care of

 Then in 1992 some amendments were made
 ab modi sarkaar yah chaahati he ki quality ajukeshan, innovations evam research par aadhaarit shiksha ko badhaava dene vaali nai shiksha niti laai jaae
 How many committees will be formed? First in 2015, the then HRD Minister Smriti Irani formed a committee under the chairmanship of former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramaniam to formulate a new education policy
 is samiti ne ek nai ajukeshan policy kaa ek draft taiyaar kiya or tatkaalani mantri smriti irani ne ise saarvajanik bhi kiya
 But HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, who became after Smriti Irani's exit, announced the formation of a new committee under the leadership of space scientist Kasturirangan to formulate a new education policy in June 2017
 is tarah purv cabinet sachiv tiesar subramanyam kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne is niti kaa jo masauda taiyaar kiya tha, vah ek tarah se thande baste main chalaa gaya
 The Modi government is completing four years, but as of now, no new education policy is known

 He said, 'we are working on a new education policy and suggestions were sought from the people
 ek maheene main iskaa praaroop taiyaar ho jayega or teen maheene main niti taiyaar ho jaaegi
 'how serious the frustration of the Subramanian Committee was for the education policy can be gauged from the frustration of the Subramanian Committee
 purv cabinet sachiv tiesar subramanyam ne june, 2016 main tatkaaleen kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ko patr likhakar maang kii thi ki nai ajukeshan policy ko lekar di gai unki report saarvajanik kii jaae
 He also warned that if he did not make the report public, he would make it public himself
 subramanyam nai ajukeshan policy kaa draft taiyaar karne ke liye banaai gai paanch sadasyeey cameti ke chairman the
 For this, he consulted the education policy on 33 themes, at the grassroots and at the national level
 is cameti main dilli kii purv chif secretary shailaja chandra, gujarat ke purv chif secretary sudhir makkad ke alaavaayensiiarti ke purv pramukhjees rajput bhi sadsy ke taur par shaamil the
 The committee submitted its report to the ministry on 27 May 2016

 gujarat congress ne shanivaar ko time patrika or bucralin santhaan dwaara prakashit lekhon main kii gayi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii prashansa kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki in lekhon main gujarat ke vikaas se jude jhuthe tathyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Time magazine, in its March 26 issue, published an article on Modi stating that 'modi means business', adding one more thing that 'but can he lead India?' State Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil told reporters that he was disappointed with these articles
 patrakarita or reporting santulit or nishpaksh honi chahie
 i wonder why these were included only by those who praised Modi
 ye lekh pakshpatpurna hai or isliye ye gujarat or desh ke logon ke saath ninsaphi he
 The Buchralin Institute also recently published an interview of Modi praising Modi for the development of Gujarat
 time patrika ne 26 march ke apane ank main modi par ek lekh prakashit kiya he jisamen kaha gaya ki ‘modi kaa matlab vyapaar he’, saath hi ek or cheez jodi gayi he ki ‘lekin kya vah bharat kaa netritv kar sakate hai?’ pradesh congress ke netaa shaktisingh gohil ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vah in lekhon se niraash hai
 Journalism and reporting should be balanced and fair
 main aashcharya main hum ki inamen sirf unheen logon ke kathan kyon shaamil kiye gaye jinhone modi kii tarif kii
 These articles are biased and therefore inappropriate with the people of Gujarat and the country

 On Tuesday, the mother of three-year-old Aviral Rana stood in the balcony of her house on the first floor of Delhi
 unhone apane bete ko skool vine se utarate hue dekha
 Within the next few moments, he was crushed under the car while rolling backward
 bachche kii nikatavarti civil lines aria ke aspataal main maut ho gai
 His blood stains are still present on that Maruti van
 do kimi dur uske play skool tak le jane ke liye ek maheene pehle hi uske abhibhavakon ne vine kii thi
 She was completely unaware that the private van violated many rules on the roads every day
 privet vine ke paas schuli bacchon ko le jane kaa permit nahin tha or us par yah darshane ke liye koi sinboard nahin tha ki vah skool vine he
 Unlike the rules, there was no teacher or attendant in the van
 gaadi par maanakon ke anuroop pile rang kii koi strip nahin thi or na hi driver kaa puraa byoraa pramukhataa se disple kiya gaya tha
 There was also no fire extinguisher or box for first aid
 sirf itnaa hi nahin giraftaar kiye gaye driver ke paas bacchon ke immergency kaantect kaa byoraa bhi nahin tha
 Driver Rahul Kumar (28) was earlier warned to drive in a non-responsible manner but no one stopped him from driving
 aviral ko main road par chhodane ke baad usne gaadi ko reverse kar aage badha di
 He also did not see that Aviral was still on the main road
 usne tab tak rukne kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaai jab tak ki aviral ke abhibhavak usko lene ke liye aate
 The local people caught him at the same place and after beating him handed over to the police
 tippaniyan Although the rules say that if the guardian is not present at the designated place, then the driver has to take the child back to school
 bhartiya railway main technitian ke pad par karyrat hitendra rana ne kaha, ''abhi bas ek maheene se hi hamane usko vine main skool bhejnaa shuru kiya tha
 She was taken just a few steps away from our house as usual, but during the reverse she climbed on the car and dragged it to some distance
 '' The Delhi government has ordered an inquiry into the matter
 play skool ne bhi is ghatana se duuri banaate hue kaha he ki yadi abhibhavak privet apramanit vainon ko yadi hair karte hai to uske liye unhen jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 The child died in a hospital in the adjacent Civil Lines area
 uske khun ke dhabbe abhi bhi us maaruti vine par maujuud he
 a month before, his parents had made a van to take him to his play school two km away
 vah tab is baat se bilkul bekhbar the ki vah privet vine har roj sadakon par kai niyamon kaa ulanghan karti thi
 The private van did not have a permit to carry school children and had no signboard to indicate that it was a school van
 niyamon ke vipareet vine main koi teacher yaa atendent maujuud nahin tha
 There were no yellow strips conforming to the standards on the vehicle, nor was the driver's full details prominently displayed
 gaadi main aag bujhane vaala yaa praathmik upachaar ke liye box bhi nahin tha
 Not only this, the arrested driver did not even have the details of the emergency contact of the children
 driver rahul kumaar (28) ko pehle bhi gaiyr-jimmedaarana dhang se gaadi chalaane ke liye chetavanee di gai thi lekin kisi ne bhi usko driving karne se nahin roka
 After leaving Aviral on the main road, he reversed the car and proceeded
 usne yah bhi nahin dekha ki aviral abhi bhi main road par tha
 He didn't even bother to stop until Aviral's guardian would come to pick him up
 usko usee jagah sthaneey logon ne pakad liya or peetane ke baad police ko saunpa
 The comments yadhyapi niyam kehete hai ki yadi nirdhaarit sthal par abhibhavak maujuud nahin hote hai to driver ko us bachche ko waapas skool le janaa hota he
 Hitendra Rana, who works as a technician in Indian Railways, said, "just a month ago, we started sending him to school in a van
 usko roj kii tarah hamaare ghar se mahaj chand kadam duuri par utaara gaya tha lekin reverse ke dauraan gaadi par chadh gai or kuch dur tak ghasitate hue le gai
 '' dilli sarkaar ne maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The play school has also distanced itself from the incident, stating that if the parents hire private unauthenticated vans, they cannot be held responsible for them
 privet vine ke paas schuli bacchon ko le jane kaa permit nahin tha or us par yah darshane ke liye koi sinboard nahin tha ki vah skool vine he

 party ne khuleam dhamkee di he ki agar congress kaa ravaiya nahin badla to bajet satr kaa aglaa hissaa chalaa paanaa mushkil hoga
 Hitting out at the Congress, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav said that his party does not take Beni Prasad Verma's statement seriously
 unhone kaha, congress main 'aa bail mujhe maar' kehane kii kuch logon kii aadat he
 He has said that if this is his habit, the Samajwadi Party also will not disappoint him because the horns of the bull are strong

 He got 400 votes from where he had fought
 unhone kaha ki agar bhashaa kii baat he to congress ko apni bhashaa par sochna chahie
 Referring to the reports published in some newspapers about the UP government, he said, it has been published in some newspapers that some central officials have said that there is corruption in the Prime Minister's Road Employment Scheme and also demanded a CBI inquiry
 mujhe lagata he ki kuch ati utsaahi log chaahe wo centre sarkaar ke hon, rajya sarkaar ko badnaam karne ke liye aarope lagaate hai
 While the reality is that it has been only a year since our government was formed and the Center has not released any money in this financial year
 'unhone kaha ki ye sarkaar ko badnaam karne vaale aarope hai
 The Chief Minister has already ordered an inquiry into the disturbances that have taken place in earlier years

 bjp's chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "the downfall of the UPA government has begun

 After receiving support from the Trinamool Congress, serious questions have arisen over the stability of this government

 ’ prasad ne kaha ki bhaajapa apane bheetar or rajg ke apane sahyogiyon se vichaar-vimarsh karne ke baad is bare main faisla karegi ki sansad ke vishesh satr ko bulaane kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 He said that the way Mamata and her Trinamool colleagues were forced to take this decision is a sign of the Congress' arrogance
 prasad ne kaha, ‘sahyogiyon se baat karnaa or un par vishwaas karnaa congress ke diene main nahin hai
 This is what we are seeing again and again
 yah aisa anhakaar he ki ham shashan kar sakate hai or dusron ko hamaara anusaran karnaa hoga
 This is the biggest ignorance of the central government
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar ab teji se alpamat kii ore bad rahi he
 It is very important that like this government, we do not have to take any decision that will make the people of the country suffer as they are in UPA-2
 ’bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘vipaksh ke dalon ko chhod dijie, sarkaar ke sahyogi dalon ko vishwaas main nahin liya jaataa he
 On the other hand, RJD supremo and former Union Minister Lalu Prasad said that this is not a new thing, Mamata Banerjee keeps changing her attitude moment by moment

 stenford main ek kaarykram ke dauraan jetali ne doharaaya ki desh aarthik sudhaaron ko agle daur main le jane ke liye apni pahal jari rakhenge chaahe jo keemat adaa kerani pade

 sanyukt satr par jetali ne kaha, 'mujhe ummid he ki hamaare saamne vah naubat nahin aegi or isse (sanyukt satr se) pehle hi ise sulajhaa liya jayega
 As far as the constitutional system is concerned, the current government has a sufficient number of forces (in the Lok Sabha)
 isliye ham yah sunishchit karnaa chahenge ki bharat main yah mahatvapurn sudhaar avashya ho
 'actually, the House that the Finance Minister belongs to does not have a majority in that House (rajya Sabha)
 vahiin vitt mantri ne spasht kiya ki yadi sanyukt satr bulaayaa jaataa he to bhaajapa or uske sahyogi dalon ke paas bhoomi adhigrahan sanshodhan vidheyak ko paas karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhyabal maujuud he
 Village and economy? More than half of the country's population lives in villages

 These Indians, who are fond of new types of tourism, like to go to such places which are untouchable and unknown, ie where very few people can reach for tourism
 ve nae-nae mahadwipon kaa rukh kar rahe hai or aisi jagahon kaa chayan kar rahe hai, jo hatakar, hon
 Tour companies no longer offer to travel to London, Switzerland or Thailand in front of any Indian, they are now giving them the attraction of completely unheard places

 where there is no rush of common tourists

 Due to the glut of information, information about people's experiences and the convenience of easy booking through a mobile phone or tablet, the whole world has shrunk
 isliye log jab chhuttiyaan manaane ke liye kisi travel agent ke paas jate hai to pehle se hi unke paas sari jaankaree hoti he
 This year, wine and whiskey tours, golf holidays, adventure vacations and a growing number of girls' travel groups are opening new trends and opening new paths

 Here are some excerpts from this special conversation: How was your experience in Bollywood? The thing i loved before Bollywood was my album Song

 Today i have 16 years in India, this is my karma land, this is my love
 bharat kii naagarikta milane par aap kya kahana chahenge?main khud ko vaisaa hi desh ko pyaar karne vaala bhartiya maanata hum jaise ki baaki bhartiya ise dekhte hai

 jaise agar mumbai main koi nayaa airport bane to meraa bhi ek naagarik kii tarah dil karata he ki main bhi isaki tasviir clic kar fasebuk par post karun or agar koi cheez kharaab lagati he to mere dil se bhi yahi nikalataa he ki
 
 
 When will it be okay man? desh main ashishnutaa vivaad par aap kya kahana chahenge?main sirf yah kahana chaahunga ki agar ashishnutaa hoti to main hindustan kii naagarikta kyon letaa?kya gulam ali sahab kohindustanmen parform karnaa chahie?beshak karnaa chahie, kyonki meraa maananaa he ki sangeet kaa koi majahab, rang or mulk nahin hota
 So it does not matter to me what is the religion of a singer, from which country he belongs, i only like his voice and it is only by his voice
 isliye yah myne nahin rakhata ki gulam ali sahab kahaan se hai
 It only matters that those who listen to them can be from any where

 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said, 'this is a big fraud
 is sarkaar ne saarvajanik taur par jo bhi baaten kahi thi yah un sabase dhokhaa he
 Asked about the meeting of NSA Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Nasir Janjua in Bangkok, Tiwari said that they are now meeting in secret after cancellation of talks after accusing each other
 unhone kaha, 'yadi aap is sarkaar ke pichley 18 maheenon ke trek record ko dekhen to unki pakistan niti betuki, ulat-pher vaali, dhulmul or 180 degree you-turn vaali rahi he
 'tiwari said that between the Indian foreign minister and the then NSA of Pakistan, the war of words in the NSA, suddenly without any provocation, without telling the country what changed between September 2015 and December 2015, the government decided to renegotiate And that too in Bangkok
 congress netaa ne kaha ki yadi baatcheet itani hi jaruri thi to sarkaar ko iske peeche kaa tark bataanaa chahie tha or nai dilli yaa islamabad main baatcheet kerani chahie thi
 However, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli supported the NSA talks, saying it was in line with the sentiments of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Ufa
 tippaniyan Kohli said that talks were held in Bangkok to avoid the eye of the media and the excitement arising out of the indo-pak relationship
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne vaarta kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki media kii chakachaundh se dur rahakar baatcheet karne se 'maun pragati' ho sakati he
 Nice to see that India and Pakistan restored the dialogue process

 Surjewala said, 'moreover, it raises genuine concerns whether it is not an attempt to divert the attention of the country from the current political and economic challenges as well as the widespread agrarian crisis
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha, 'yah bahut bada dhokhaa he
 Whatever this government has said publicly, it is a deception

 He said, 'if you look at the track record of the last 18 months of this government, their Pakistan policy has been absurd, reversible, wavering and 180 degree U-turn
 ' tiwari ne kaha ki bhartiya videsh mantri or pakistan ke tatkaaleen enese main jubaani jang ke bich ab achaanak bina kisi uksaave ke, bagaiyr desh ko bataae hue ki sitambar 2015 or disambar 2015 ke bich kya badal gaya, sarkaar ne phir se baatcheet karne kaa faisla kiya or vah bhi bangkok main
 The Congress leader said that if the talks were as urgent, the government should have explained the reasoning behind it and held talks in New Delhi or Islamabad

 In today's firing, a soldier of the Indian Army has died and four others have been injured

 viraat kohlico bahut gussa aata he
 Sometimes fellow players vent their anger on the cricket kit
 virodhiyon se ulajhane main bhi peeche nahin rahata
 When Virat, who captained the Indian team in the Adelaide Test, started his career, everyone had the same concepts about him
 isamen kohli ke ravaiye kaa bhi ahm yogadan rahaa
 But things are slowly changing
 viratako aaj bhi gussa aata he
 If he feels anything bad, he gives a reply on his mouth
 par sabase thos jawaab apane balle se detaa he
 That too in such a way that the critics should be completely silent
 edilade test ke tisare din bhi kuch aisa hi hua
 After the embarrassing tour of England, questions were raised about Virat Kohli's batting in Tests
 cricket ke jaankaron kaa kahana tha ki ab kohli ke liye ran bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The major flaw in his technique has been revealed
 australia main mishael johnson, peter sidle or reyaan haris jaise gendbaaj unhen ek-ek ran ke liye tarasaayenge
 However, contrary to estimates, Kohli stopped speaking
 jab australia ne 517 par pari ghoshit kii to ek pal lagane laga tha ki shaayad bhartiya ballebaaj ek baar phir ghutane na tech den
 But Virat had set something else
 nateeja yah ki viraat kohli ne shatak jad daalaa
 Kohli did not have a happy ending as soon as he hit a boundary towards the midwicket boundary on the second ball of the 85th over of the Indian innings
 kohli ne apane chir parichit main andaaj main is jujharu pari kaa jashn manaaya
 He faced 158 balls to complete a century
 afsos sirf iskaa he ki kohli 115 ran ke score par mishael johnson kaa shikaar ban gaye
 But he laid the foundation that the Indian team needed
 viraat kohli kii yah pari kai mino main ahm he
 
 
 Not the tongue, two answers with the ball and bat When Virat Kohli was constantly flopping in England, he was strongly criticized
 har koi unke ravaiye or takanic ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahaa tha
 The media often asked about the relationship between him and Anushka Sharma
 kuch ne to unke kharaab form kaa thikra is rishte par hi phod diya
 But Virat kept quiet
 chupchaap apane game or takanic par dhyaan lagaaya
 Sachin also reached Tendulkar's shelter if needed
 par media ke kisi aise sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya jo unke khel se sambandhit nahin tha
 And as if he scored a century in Adelaide, he gave an answer to every question arising on him without saying anything
 unhone jis andaaj main is centuri kaa jashn manaaya, maano kah rahe hon
 
 
 Got the answer
 aage se sirf mere khel par dhyaan do
 In the form of TV commentary found from ODI, you must have heard that ODI and Test are two different formats
 ballebaaji kaa tarika alag-alag he
 Former New Zealand cricketer Martin Crowe even wrote about Virat saying that he is a great one-day player, but there is doubt about the Test
 ab ise sanyog hi kahie ki england main out of form chal rahe kohli ne form main vaapasi vanade cricket ke dam par hi kii he
 After the Delhi ODI match against West Indies this year, as if Kohli did not look back
 vanade kii pichhali chah pariyon main kohli kaa score card kuch aisa rahaa he
 
 
 127, 22, 49, 53, 66 and 139 not out
 australia main varrup mukaable main do ardhashtakeey pari
 Kohli, who started scoring once, did not look back
 kharaab form kuch samay kaa or class permanentaorm Is Temporary But Class Is Permanent, cricket main aksar is jumale kaa istemaal hota he
 Kohli was scoring runs before the tour of England, but he also had a bad phase as happens with every cricketer
 takanic ne aisa dhokhaa diya ki match dar match unka pradarshan girtaa gaya
 But the one who has a class in the game, he will return at some time or the other, Kohli proved this
 shuruyaat vanade se kii or edilade main ise jari rakhe
 Hopefully, the blast will continue in the coming days
 saajhedaari par jorkohli kii is pari kii sabase ahm baat yah rahi ki unhone tisare wicket ke liye cheteshwar pujaara ke saath 81 or chauthe wicket ke liye ajinkya rahane ke saath 101 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Rohit Sharma added 74 runs for the fifth wicket
 bhale hi abhi team india australia ke score se bahut dur he, par kohli kii is ranneeti ne bharat ko unke score ke kareeb to laa hi diya he
 If captain, then the task of the game captain is not just to hold a press conference
 uski bhoomika plaing ilevan kaa chayan, maidan par gendbaaji kram tay karnaa yaa phir filding lagane tak simit nahin rahati
 He is part of the team as a cricketer
 yani use bhi balle yaa gend se pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Being captain will also be more responsibility
 yani dusron ke liye udhaaharan pesh karnaa hoga
 When the Indian team was leaving for the tour of Australia, they had said that we will respond to their attack aggressively
 kohli ne yah sab apane pradarshan ke jariye kar dikhaaya
 Playing the captaincy innings also boosted the morale of the team's players and in a gesture to the fellow batsman, he said, "your turn

 Virat Kohli's magic has not yet been done in the IPL tournament nor in any global cricket tournament
 ipel main bhi kohli ab tak royal chalangers bengalooru (RCB) ko champion banane main naakaamayaab rahe hai or ab world cap jaise toornament main bhi un par laga chokars kaa thappa hatane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Kohli, one of the best players in the world in the current era, had a big chance to prove his superiority not only as a batsman but as a captain
 lekin vah newjiland ke khilaaf semifinal match main mahaj 1 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Talking about Virat Kohli, he was also out in the World Cup 2015 semi-final match against Australia by scoring one run
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab viraat kohli world cap ke kisi nokout match main flop hue hai
 Cricket's most dangerous 'virus attack' on Team India, missed out on a crucial occasion before Kohli was dismissed by scoring just nine runs against Pakistan in the 2011 World Cup semi-final match
 us match main vah tej gendbaaj wahaab riyaj kii gend par umr akmal ke haathon kaich out hue the
 After this, Kohli was dismissed for one run against Australia in the 2015 World Cup semi-final match
 us match main vah kangaroo tej gendbaaj michel johnson kii gend par ooncha shot khel baithe or wicketiper bread hedin ke haathon lapke gaye
 12 in the knockout matches of the Virat Kohli World Cup
 16 kii ausat se mahaj 73 ran hi bana paae hai
 During this time his strike rate was 56
 15 kaa rahaa he jo behad sharmnaak he
 Kohli had a chance to join Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's club
 1983 main bharat ko kapil dev ne pehali baar world cap jitayaa tha
 Just 28 years after that, Mahendra Singh Dhoni made India the 2011 World Champion
 lekin 8 saal baad viraat kohli bharat ko teesraa world cap kaa khitaab nahin jita paae
 In 2017, Kohli led India to the final of the tournament in the Mini World Cup i
e
 Champions Trophy played in England
 lekin, is baar phens ko ummid thi ki bharat ko champions trophy 2017 upavijeta banane vaale kohli is baar bhartiya team ko world cap jitwa denge
 But, the opposite happened

 Some experts also believe that Shibu Soren was unhappy with the unnecessary interference of BJP leaders in the state, which is why he once again joined the UPA
 ab ek sthiti aisi ban sakati he ki jhamumo, jharkhand vikaas morcha or congress ke saath milakar pradesh main nai sarkaar kaa gathan kare
 It is also possible that the UPA gives Shibu Soren a place in the Center and Shibu's son Hemant Soren is given the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 tab mukhyamantri kii kursi congress apane paas rakh sakati he
 In the second situation, Shibu Soren can continue as the Chief Minister of the state and JHVIMO can support the government from outside

 Former captain Rahul Dravid praised Virat Kohli and described him as the 'best Indian batsman' in current form
 unhone kaha ki newjiland ke khilaaf duusare test main dabaav bhare halaaton main jeet kaa lakshya hasil karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane se uske aatmavishvaas main kaaphi badhotaree hogi
 Dravid had arrived in the commentary box as a guest commentator
 unhone kaha, ‘viraat behtareen ballebaaj he
 He is the best batsman in the Indian team in current form
 usne sachmuch maukon kaa puraa phayda uthaaya he
 Kohli, along with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, helped the Indian team achieve the target
 dravid ne kaha ki team ko chauthi pari main jeet tak le jane ke anubhav se uske aatmavishvaas main badhotaree hogi
 He said, 'virat had Dhoni for advice, but achieving this goal will definitely boost his confidence
 ’viraat ko kariyar ke shuru main svachhand cricketer kaha jaataa tha or dravid ko lagata he ki is ballebaaj ne kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 Dravid said, 'I have seen his career since the days of Under-19
 vah royal chalangers bangalore kaa hissaa tha, maine use kareeb se dekha he
 His talent was never questioned, but there were some issues related to mental discipline
 ’bharat kii ore se 164 test khel chuke is anbhavi khilaadi ne kaha, ‘lekin main khush hum ki usne galatiyon se sikh lee he or ballebaaj ke rup main kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 Initially he had some problems with short pitch balls but now he has improved a lot
 ’dravid ne kaha ki rohit sharma, anjiky rahane or manoj tiwari main test team main jagah banane kii yogyata he
 He said, 'rahane is a very talented batsman
 mumbai indiens ke saath kuch varsh kaaphi kathin the kyonki uskaa ballebaaji line ap kaaphi majboot tha
 But he came to the royals and knew very well that he would get a chance and took full advantage of those opportunities
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘aakhirkaar yuva khilaadiyon ke liye khilne vaala samay ahm he
 You can learn some things with other players in the dressing room, but you learn big things only by staying at the crease
 ’dravid haalanki dwipaksheeya ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon kii shrinkhalaa kaa samarthan nahin karte or unhen iskaa koi phayda dikhaayi nahin detaa
 He said, 'I think all three formats can exist
 lekin main chaahunga ki vanade ko keval isisi toornamenton jaise vishwa cap or champions trophy tak hi simit kar dena chahie
 Twenty20 cricket is gaining popularity
 lekin mujhe paanch yaa saat maichon kii dwipaksheeya ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon kii shrinkhalaa karwaane kaa koi phayda nahin dikhataa
 'dravid said,' But it was nice to see such an audience for Test matches
 yah darshata he ki test cricket ko ab bhi pasand kiya jaataa he
 ' viraat kohli ke netritv main team india ne buudhvaar ko world cap main dakshin africa ke khilaaf match ke saath apni muhim kaa aagaaz kar diya
 Looking at the form of Team India, everyone's tongue is whether Kohli will be able to repeat the same history under his captaincy which Kapil Dev had done in 1983 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in 2011
 1983 main bharat ne final main west indies or 2011 main srilanka ko maat dekar cap par kabza jamaaya tha
 In the current World Cup being played in England in 2019, India is being considered as a strong contender for the title
 15 sadasyeey team india main anubhav or yuva pratibha kaa behatar samavesh mana ja rahaa he
 The Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of the India Today Group tried to identify after scrutinizing the earlier performance of India's players - which players will prove to be important in this World Cup
 DIU ne india ke batting line ap kaa do paimaanon par vishleshan kiya
 > How fast do they score (strike rate)?> How much do they score on average? India's batting axis revolves around Captain Kohli, Kohli has the highest number of runs in the current team
 kohli abhi tak vanade cricket main 41 shatak jad chuke hai
 Not only do they play long innings, they have also been increasing the pace of Team India's score with a strike rate of 93
 kohli ke alaava do or batsman bhi team india ke liye bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Rohit Sharma in top order and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in lower middle order
 rohit or dhoni donon hi score karne ke saath ek chor sanbhaalane kii bhoomika bakhubi nibhaate rahe hai
 Rohit is definitely cautious in the beginning of the innings but when his eyes get set, he plays long innings
 hairat kii baat nahin ki rohit ke naam van de cricket main sabase zyada dohare shatak darj hai
 Not only this, Rohit also has the record of playing the biggest innings of 264 runs in ODI cricket
 jahaan tak bharat ke purv captain dhoni kaa sawaal he to unhen finishr ke taur par ab tak ke sabase asardaar khilaadiyon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Dhoni is the most experienced in the current team
 dhoni ko jaisi sthiti ho usee ke anuroop apane khel ko dhaalane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Dhoni has scored 10 centuries and 71 fifties in 341 ODI cricket matches in his career
 yuva pratibhaaon kii baat kii jaae to team india ke paas hardik pandya jaisaa visphotak alrounder maujuud he, heater ke taur par pahchaan rakhane vaale hardik kaa strike rate 117 kaa he
 Hardik has won his bat several times with his bat and has got his iron back
 bharat kii batting line-ap kaa ab tak kaa pradarshantim india ke bowling department kii baat kii jaae to is baar kaafii dhardaar najar aata he
 If all eyes will be on Jasprit Bumrah in the pace bowling, then lethal bowlers like Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami are also present to support him
 phiraki kaa zimmaa yajuvendra chahal or kuldeep yadav ke kandhon par he
 Apart from these, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has also been showing his feats in Firki
 pes bolors kaa saath dene ke liye english condishan main hardik pandya kii madhyam tej gendbaazi bhi kargar sabit ho sakati he
 Apart from Bumrah, Chahal and Yadav could prove to be important for India this time, if Bolar's past performance is analyzed
 slog overs main bumraah apni maarak yorkers ke saath sabase shreshth gendbaaj ke taur par ubhare hai
 Bumrah has taken 85 wickets in 49 odis
 bumraah kii ek or khaasiyat bowling main kanjusee se ran dena he
 His bowling average is 22 runs per wicket
 bumraah kaa kariyar iconomi rate 4
 5 runs per over
 vanade cricket main chinamen ke liye jane jane vaale chahal or leg spinner yadav kaa ausat bhi 25 ran prati wicket ke saath kaaphi acha he
 Their economy rate is also economical
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ve pes bowling ke liye upyukt english condishan main kaise dhardaar bowling karte hai
 Mohammed Shami's bowling average is 26 runs per wicket in India's three pace bowlers
 unka iconomi rate 5
 5 per over
 agar shami apane iconomi rate par or niyantran rakhte hai to bumraah ke badhiya jodidar sabit ho sakate hai
 India's Bollars performance so far solanki ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri ne vakpatutaa ke saath uddand gorakshakon ke bare main kaha, lekin ham logon ko yah nahin bataaya ki mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan unhone khud is tarah ke kaam ke liye gorakshakon ko protsaahit kiya tha

 West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee on Friday announced an ex-gratia amount of Rs 25,000 for each of the 28000 Durga Puja organizers of the state
 banerjee ke is elaan kaa matlab he ki rajya main durga puja ke aayojan vaale klbon ko die jane vaale anudaan main 150% badhotaree hogi
 CM Mamta while addressing her annual meeting with the Pooja Committee at Netaji Indoor Stadium in Kolkata said, 'I have decided to increase the amount from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25000
 maine pehle hi apane vitt mantri amit mitra ke saath is bare main charchaa kii he
 We will give it to all worship organizers
 iske alaava kolkata police 5000 rupee un pujaaon ke liye degi, jo mahilaon ke jariye yojit kii jaati hai
 This is to promote our heritage, tourism, culture and community development
 'bataa den ki durga puja aayojakon ke liye 28 karod rupee kii raashi kii ghoshnaa pichley saal pehali baar kii gai thi
 At the same time, the increased amount means that the government will spend Rs 70 crore this year

 We will not allow any politics on Durga Puja
