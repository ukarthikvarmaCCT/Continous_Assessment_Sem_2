 The festival of Deepawali is near

 Chinese lights that illuminate the houses are also dominated
 lekin is saal desh main chautarafa chyanij chizon kaa virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 The Gujarat Chambers of Commerce and Industries has ordered traders associated with them to boycott this item
 chembar ke adhyaksh bipin patel kaa kahana he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf china bharat ko thik se samarthan nahin de rahaa he, isliye iske virodh main ve china ke saamaan kaa bahishkaar karenge
 On the other hand, there is a decrease in the sale of Chinese firecrackers in Gujarat's firecracker market
 gujarat ke log bhi is baar chyanij pataakhon or electronics saamagree se khud ko dur rakhana chaahate hai
 Obviously, local businessmen have to bear the brunt of this growing anger towards China made goods
 tippaniyan One businessman said that the government should have taken the decision to ban Chinese firecrackers by february-march so that no merchant would buy this item
 ab bade paimaane par vyapaariyon ne chini pataakhe or anya utpaada kharid liye hai to swaabhaavik taur par ve use bechenge hi
 In Ahmedabad, Chinese goods are sold in Kalupur, Delhi Darwaja, Raipur, Kubera Nagar, etc
 lekin satellite, jajis bangala road jaise ilaakon main yah saamaan najar nahin aata he
 Some traders are in support of this and many traders are angry with this decision
 gujarat main chinis chizon kaa salanaa vyapaar kareeb 20,000 karod kaa he
 Chamber President Bipin Patel says that China is not supporting India properly against terrorism, so they will boycott Chinese goods in protest against it
 duusari ore gujarat ke pataakhaa bazaar main chyanij pataakhon kii bikri main kami najar aa rahi he
 People of Gujarat also want to keep themselves away from Chinese firecrackers and electronics items
 jaahir he china nirmit chizon ke prati bad rahe is aakrosh kaa khamiyaja sthaneey vyapaariyon ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The comments ek vyapaaree ne kaha ki sarkaar ko chines pataakhon par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla farvari-march tak le lenaa chahie tha taaki koi vyapaaree yah saamaan nahin kharidta
 Now, on a large scale, traders have bought sugar crackers and other products, then naturally they will sell it

 But this stuff is not visible in areas like satellite, Jajis Bungalow Road

 bibisi ne khabar di ki mullah umr maaraa ja chukaa he to ye tamaam media main surkhiyaan bani
 It was also written quoting Afghan government sources that he had died two-three years ago
 isse aage peeche kii koi jaankaree yah kehete hue nahin di gai ki sarkari sutara ne isse adhik koi byora nahin diya he
 Shortly after this news, Syed Zafar Hashmi, deputy spokesman for the President of Afghanistan, called the media for a press conference via tweet
 phir afgaan sarkaar kii ore se yah bayaan aayaa ki media main mullah umr ke maare jane kii khabar dekhne ke baad vah is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki kya mullah umr kii sachmuch main maut ho chuki he
 Then the news of the death was also corrected by quoting Afghan intelligence agency
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki yadi yah khabar afghanistan sarkaar ke 'sutara' ke hawaale se ai, to sarkaar ne iske paksh main saboot kyon nahin pesh kiye
 And also, if the BBC ran it like breaking news, why couldn't it provide some more details? aisa nahin he ki mullah umr ke maut kii khabar pehali baar ai ho
 This has happened many times before, but never investigated
 taliban apni tarah se ise nakaarta rahaa he
 Even the Taliban recently issued a congratulatory message in the name of Mullah Omar on the occasion of Eid
 is baar to yah khabar likhe jane tak taliban ne apni taraf se mullah umr kii maut kii khabar par koi pratikriya nahin di he
 As many claims of Mullah Omar to be alive, the same gestures are for his not being alive
 purv afgaan taliban ke ek mantri ne pakistan ke ek akhbaar ko bataaya tha ki mullah umr kii 2013 main tibi se maut ho chuki he
 It was also said that he was buried on the land of Afghanistan and he and his son also identified his body
 isse alag, taliban se tuutakar alag hue ek group afghanistan islamic movement fidaayin mahaj ke pravaktaa kaari hamaja ke anusaar mullah umr july 2013 main hi mullah akhtar mohammad mansoor or gul aagaa kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho gaya tha
 Hamza also claimed that he had evidence to this effect, but the Afghan government or Western media did not value him
 mullah umr kahaan he is baat ko lekar bhi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Many other intelligence agencies, including the US, believe that he is hiding somewhere around the pak-afghan border, while some believe he, like Osama bin Laden, has taken refuge in Pakistan
 mullah baradar kii pakistan main giraftaar ke baad is andeshe ko or hawa mili ki vah queta yaa karachi ke paas surakshit jagah par he, lekin uske thikaane ko lekar bharose ke saath kabhi kuch kaha nahin gaya
 That too when the US has also announced a bounty of US $ 10 billion on Omar's head
 is baar ek badi dilachasp baat mullah umr ke maare jane kii khabar kii timming ko lekar bhi he
 It is being said that a meeting has been held on Wednesday for the election of the new chief in the Taliban
 isamen mullah umr kii ore se hi niyukt do sahaayakon main se ek mullah baradar ko mukhiya banaae jane ko lekar charchaa hui
 Baradar was arrested in Pakistan and later released along with several other Taliban prisoners on the plea that it would help in starting peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government
 aise main sawaal uthanaa swaabhaavik he ki yadi mullah umr jinda he to nae mukhiya ke chunaav kaa sawaal kyon
 Or is it that this 'news' is being done to create psychological pressure on the Taliban to reduce its 'bargaining power'? is saptaah ke ant main afgaan hai pis council or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich duusare daur kii shanti vaarta honi he jo pakistan kii madad se ho rahi he
 The purpose of this conversation is to find a way to end the fourteen years of fighting in Afghanistan
 duusare daur kii baatcheet kii taarikh or jagah ko lekar thodaa suspence he lekin iskaa hona tay he
 Some sources suggest that the second round of talks will take place in Pakistan on 30â€“31 July and that too in Hill Station Mary where the first round of peace talks took place
 isamen yah tay hua tha ki phir milenge
 There were reports that the second round of talks would be held in China's northwestern city of Urumqi, although this could not be confirmed
 is khabar ko isliye bhi hawa mili, kyonki pehle daur kii baatcheet main china or america ke paryvekshak bhi shaamil hue the
 It was also learned that the Taliban wants talks in Doha
 tippaniyan On July 7, the site of the first round of talks was kept secret, but it was later learned that it had taken place at the nearby hill station Mari, Islamabad
 is baatcheet main mukhya taur par taliban ne apni kai maangon par jo diya
 This included lifting the ban on the Taliban in the U
N
 so that its members could undertake international travel without interruption, allowing the Taliban to open an office of their own to establish themselves as a political party
 afgaan sarkaar chaahati he ki pehle taliban puri tarah se yudhviram ko raji ho
 There were several informal rounds of talks between Afghan and Taliban representatives before reaching the formal table of talks
 ye alag baat he ki sawaal is par bhi uthte rahe hai ki agar taliban ke saath shanti vaarta kisi nattejey par pahunch hi gai to kya afghaanist main sacriye aatankwaadiyon ke tamaam dhade ise maanenge
 But until the official evidence on Mullah Omar's death is presented and the Taliban accept it, the question will remain whether there is any international diplomacy behind this news 'running'? is khabar ke thodi der baad afghanistan ke raashtrapati ke up pravaktaa syed jafar hashmi ne twit ke jariye media ko press conference ke liye bulaayaa
 Then came a statement from the Afghan government that after seeing the news of Mullah Omar being killed in the media, she was investigating whether Mullah Omar had actually died
 phir afgani khufia agency ke hawaale se maut kii khabar ko sahi bhi bataa diya gaya
 Now the question arises that if this news came from the 'sutra' of the government of Afghanistan, why did the government not provide evidence in its favor
 or yah bhi ki yadi bibisi ne ise braking news kii tarah chalaaya to vah kuch or byora kyon nahin de paaya? It is not the first time that the news of Mullah Omar's death has come
 pehle bhi kai baar aisa ho chukaa he, lekin kabhi jaanch nahin hui
 The Taliban has been denying it in its own way
 yahaan tak ki taliban ne haal hi main id ke maukey par bhi mullah umr ke naam se badhai sandesh jari kiya tha
 This time, till this news is written, the Taliban has not reacted to the news of Mullah Omar's death
 mullah umr ke jinda rahane ke jitne daawey hai, utane hi ishaare uske jivit nahin hone ke bhi hai
 a former Afghan Taliban minister told a Pakistani newspaper that Mullah Omar died of TB in 2013
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki use afghanistan kii jameen par hi dafnaaya gaya unhone or unke bete ne uske shav kii pahchaan bhi kii
 Apart from this, according to Qari Hamza, a spokesman for the Afghan Islamic Movement Fidayeen, a group that broke away from the Taliban, Mullah Omar had fallen victim to the bullets of Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansoor and Gul Agha in July 2013 itself
 hamaja ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unke paas is baat ke saboot hai, lekin afgaan sarkaar yaa pashchimi media ne use mahatv nahin diya
 Questions have also been raised about where Mullah Omar is
 america sahit kai anya khufia agenciyaan maanati hai ki wo paak afgaan seemaa ke aasapaas kahin chipa he jabaki kuch kaa maananaa he ki osama bin laden kii tarah vah bhi pakistan main sharan liye hue he
 After Mulla Baradar's arrest in Pakistan, the Andeshe received further air that he was in a safe place near Quetta or Karachi, but nothing was ever said with confidence about his whereabouts
 vah bhi tab jab umr ke sir par 10 billian america dollar kaa inaam bhi america ne ghoshit kiya hua he
 This time a very interesting thing is also about the timing of the news of Mullah Omar being killed
 kaha ja rahaa he ki taliban main nae mukhiya ke chunaav ko lekar buudhvaar ko hi ek baithak hui he
 In this, there was a discussion about the appointment of Mullah Baradar, one of the two assistants appointed by Mullah Omar
 baradar ko pakistan main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or baad main use kai anya talibani kaidiyon ke saath is daleel ke saath reeha kar diya gaya tha ki isse taliban or afgaan sarkaar ke bich shanti vaarta shuru karne main madad milegi
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Mullah Omar is alive then why the question of election of the new chief
 yaa phir kahin aisa to nahin ki is 'khabar' ke jariye taliban par manovaigyanik dabaav banane ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he taaki uske 'sauda karne kii takat' ko kam kiya ja sake? a second round of peace talks is to be held later this week between the Afghan High Peace Council and Taliban representatives, which is being held with the help of Pakistan
 is baatcheet kaa makasad afghanistan main chaudaa saal se chal rahi ladaai ko khatm karne ke liye rasta talashna he
 There is some suspense regarding the date and place of the second round of talks but this is sure to happen
 kuch sutara bataate hai ki duusare daur kii baatcheet 30-31 july ko pakistan main hi hogi or vah bhi hill stesan mari main jahaan pehle daur kii shanti vaarta hui thi
 It was decided that we would meet again
 kuch aisi bhi report aa rahi thi ki duusare daur kii vaarta china ke uttari pashchimi shahar urumki main hogi, haalanki isaki pushti nahin ho pai
 This news also got wind because the first round of talks were attended by observers from China and America
 yah bhi jaankaree ai ki taliban doha main baatcheet chahta he
 The comments saat july ko pehle daur kii baatcheet kii jagah ko gupt rakhaa gaya tha, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki yah islamabad ke najadik ke hill stesan mari main hi hui thi
 In this conversation, the Taliban mainly gave in to their many demands
 isamen yuan main taliban se pratibandh hataanaa taaki iske sadsy antarrashtriya yatraaen bina kisi rukaawat ke kar saken, taliban ko apana ek karyaalay kholane kii anumati dena, taaki vah khud ko ek raajnneetik party ke taur par khud ko sthapit kar sake
 The Afghan government wants the Taliban to fully agree to a ceasefire first
 baatcheet kii aupchaarik mej tak pahunchane ke pehle afgaan or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kai anaupchaarik daur kii baatcheet hui
 It is a different matter that questions have also arisen that if peace talks with Taliban have reached any conclusion, then all the factions of the terrorists who are active in Afghanistan will accept it
 lekin mullah umr kii maut par sarkari saboot pesh kiye jane tak or taliban ke ise maan liye jane tak ye sawaal bana rahegaa ki aakhir abhi is khabar ko 'chalaane' ke peeche kahin koi antarrashtriya kootneeti to nahin? It is not the first time that the news of Mullah Omar's death has come
 pehle bhi kai baar aisa ho chukaa he, lekin kabhi jaanch nahin hui

 mullah baradar kii pakistan main giraftaar ke baad is andeshe ko or hawa mili ki vah queta yaa karachi ke paas surakshit jagah par he, lekin uske thikaane ko lekar bharose ke saath kabhi kuch kaha nahin gaya
 That too when the US has also announced a bounty of US $ 10 billion on Omar's head
 is baar ek badi dilachasp baat mullah umr ke maare jane kii khabar kii timming ko lekar bhi he
 It is being said that a meeting has been held on Wednesday for the election of the new chief in the Taliban
 isamen mullah umr kii ore se hi niyukt do sahaayakon main se ek mullah baradar ko mukhiya banaae jane ko lekar charchaa hui
 Baradar was arrested in Pakistan and later released along with several other Taliban prisoners on the plea that it would help in starting peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government
 aise main sawaal uthanaa swaabhaavik he ki yadi mullah umr jinda he to nae mukhiya ke chunaav kaa sawaal kyon
 Or is it that this 'news' is being done to create psychological pressure on the Taliban to reduce its 'bargaining power'? is saptaah ke ant main afgaan hai pis council or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich duusare daur kii shanti vaarta honi he jo pakistan kii madad se ho rahi he
 The purpose of this conversation is to find a way to end the fourteen years of fighting in Afghanistan
 duusare daur kii baatcheet kii taarikh or jagah ko lekar thodaa suspence he lekin iskaa hona tay he
 Some sources suggest that the second round of talks will take place in Pakistan on 30â€“31 July and that too in Hill Station Mary where the first round of peace talks took place
 isamen yah tay hua tha ki phir milenge
 There were reports that the second round of talks would be held in China's northwestern city of Urumqi, although this could not be confirmed
 is khabar ko isliye bhi hawa mili, kyonki pehle daur kii baatcheet main china or america ke paryvekshak bhi shaamil hue the
 It was also learned that the Taliban wants talks in Doha

 afgaan sarkaar chaahati he ki pehle taliban puri tarah se yudhviram ko raji ho
 There were several informal rounds of talks between Afghan and Taliban representatives before reaching the formal table of talks

 But until the official evidence on Mullah Omar's death is presented and the Taliban accept it, the question will remain whether there is any international diplomacy behind this news 'running'? kuch sutara bataate hai ki duusare daur kii baatcheet 30-31 july ko pakistan main hi hogi or vah bhi hill stesan mari main jahaan pehle daur kii shanti vaarta hui thi
 It was decided that we would meet again
 kuch aisi bhi report aa rahi thi ki duusare daur kii vaarta china ke uttari pashchimi shahar urumki main hogi, haalanki isaki pushti nahin ho pai
 This news also got wind because the first round of talks were attended by observers from China and America
 yah bhi jaankaree ai ki taliban doha main baatcheet chahta he
 The comments saat july ko pehle daur kii baatcheet kii jagah ko gupt rakhaa gaya tha, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki yah islamabad ke najadik ke hill stesan mari main hi hui thi
 In this conversation, the Taliban mainly gave in to their many demands
 isamen yuan main taliban se pratibandh hataanaa taaki iske sadsy antarrashtriya yatraaen bina kisi rukaawat ke kar saken, taliban ko apana ek karyaalay kholane kii anumati dena, taaki vah khud ko ek raajnneetik party ke taur par khud ko sthapit kar sake
 The Afghan government wants the Taliban to fully agree to a ceasefire first
 baatcheet kii aupchaarik mej tak pahunchane ke pehle afgaan or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kai anaupchaarik daur kii baatcheet hui
 It is a different matter that questions have also arisen that if peace talks with Taliban have reached any conclusion, then all the factions of the terrorists who are active in Afghanistan will accept it
 lekin mullah umr kii maut par sarkari saboot pesh kiye jane tak or taliban ke ise maan liye jane tak ye sawaal bana rahegaa ki aakhir abhi is khabar ko 'chalaane' ke peeche kahin koi antarrashtriya kootneeti to nahin? On July 7, the site of the first round of talks was kept secret, but it was later learned that it had taken place at the nearby hill station Mari, Islamabad

An important chapter in the life of the Bharatiya Janata Party has come to an end
 party ko hindootv ke naare se urjavan banane main pramukh bhoomika nibhaane vaale laal krishna adwani or unke sahyogi murali manohar joshi ab sansadeey samiti main nahin hai
 Both leaders have held important positions in the party since 1980 and they are heard
 adwani ne party ko satta main laane ke liye kai ranneetiyaan banaain or 1998 main agar party satta main ai to uskaa shrey adwani ko bhi gaya
 He was the second largest leader of the party during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's reign
 apni rathyatra or shila yatra se unhone party ko gaanv-gaanv pahunchaa diya
 Joshi strengthened the party at the ideological level
 donon ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath milakar bhartiya janata party ko bhartiya raajnneeti main sthapit kiya
 Vajpayee is now ill and he is not active either
 iske saath hi desh kii raajnneeti main is shaktishaalee tikdi ke party main kaaryakalapon par pardaa gir gaya he
 After the unprecedented success of the party's Lok Sabha elections in the name of Narendra Modi, it was almost decided that the time would be heavy for the elderly leaders of the party
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki adwani ne modi ko aage badhaayaa lekin jab unhen laga ki vah kuch zyada hi aage nikal rahe hai to unhone nakaaratmak niti apanaai
 He left no stone unturned to stop Modi, obstruct his path and, above all, openly oppose him
 murali manohar joshi ne bhi varanasi seat chhodane main kaaphi naa-nukur kii
 He did not even go to campaign for Modi
 darasal ye donon bade netaa diwaar par likhi ibaaraton ko padhane main naakaamayaab rahe
 Growing old age had put the curtain in front of his eyes and he kept on opposing Modi
 yah unke paksh main nahin gaya or jaahir he ki modi ke virodh kii niti unke liye mahangi sabit hui
 As part of the policy of getting the party rescued from the elderly and bringing the youth, Modi gave new leaders a chance
 party kii is sheersh samiti main unhone nae logon ko aajamaaya he or sab kuch apni soch ke anusaar kiya he
 The new parliamentary committee is made up entirely of leaders of Modi's liking and will obviously follow his direction
 modi nahin chaahate ki ab 'ghar' main unka koi virodh ho yaa ve apane icchaanusaar faisle nahin kar paaen
 Now Modi has completely got hold of the party
 dekhnaa he ki vah use kis disha main le jate hai
 The party will stamp their point and the verdict will also be as per their wish
 puraane or bujrg netaaon ke liye party main maarg darshak samiti bana di gai he
 Leaders like Advani and Joshi will be able to sit there and watch the party's activities and its direction but will not be able to do anything
 ise hi kehete hai samay kaa pher

 aajkal sirf umradraj log hi nahin balki bachche or yang log bhi dil kii bimariyon or hai blad pressure kii beemaari kaa shikaar ho rah hai
 The biggest reason for this is poor lifestyle and poor eating habits
 log bladpressure ko control karne ke liye dawaaon ke saath hi yoga, eksrasij or bhi na jane kitne hi jatan karte hai lekin ek baar agar is samasya se insaan grasit ho jaae to ise thik kar paanaa thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Due to the problem of BP, later heart diseases start to bother humans
 in sab se nijaat paane ke liye agar roj subah ek seb khaaya jaae to sharir ko puri tarah swasth rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Eating apple keeps the electrolyte balance in the body and at the same time the fiber and vitamins present in it fill the deficiency of nutrients in the body
 agar aapako lo beepi kii samasya he to turant ke seb kha len
 By doing this, the body will get instant energy and your BP will also become normal
 seb sharir main sodium kii maatra ko bhi badhaakar kidney par padane vaale pressure ko bhi kam kar detaa he
 Along with this, people who have diabetes complaints should also eat apples daily
 seb ko apni daily diet kaa hissaa banaaen
 Then you can eat it in breakfast in the morning or you can eat it in salad
 seb ko shaam ke baad yaa raat ko khaanaa khaane ke baad khaane se bachein

 The agency has issued this warning after such cases came to light

 Union Minister Smriti Irani has attacked the opposition unity fiercely
 saath hi unhone bengal main bijepi kaaryakarta kii hatya par bhi mamata banerjee sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 Smriti said in Ahmedabad in Gujarat on Saturday that if the strategy is formed, it will not have a public discussion, but it would also be fair to say that the opposition parties have to struggle and have to unite to preserve their existence
 unhone kaha, 'bharat kii janata ke liye vipaksh ye bhi sanket de rahaa he ki unamem ab itnaa damakham nahin he ki wo akele hi apni vichaardhaara, policy yaa netritv ke bal par hindustan kaa dil jeet sake
 So, being one of the opposition somewhere is the biggest sign and example of Modi's popularity
 saath hi yah sanket bhi he ki vipaksh main akele ladane kaa dam nahin he
 On the killing of BJP worker in Bengal, Smriti said that the state government is sitting silent on the soft killings
 ab tak saamne aakar kisi ne kuch nahin bolaa he
 Resentment is being expressed only from BJP workers
 unhone kaha, 'main aaj desh ke har us naagarik se kahana chaahati hum ki bengal kii us dasha kii ore dekhe ki vahaan sirf chunaav main hi loktantr kaa galaa ghontne kaa prayaas nahin hota, balki kaise bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko nishaanaa banaakar unki hatya kii ja rahi he
 He further said, "these murders are happening only because they are trying to carry forward the saga of development
" isliye kyonki wo desh ko pehle rakhana chaahate hai
 Their only fault is that they are in the interest of nationalism
 unka dosha sirf ye he ki wo bhartiya janata party ke kaaryakarta hai
 Smriti Irani said that if the Azamata Banerjee government fails to give better law and order to the people of the state, and to give justice to the victim's family in the targeted killings, then it is not only a matter of anger of BJP workers but of the entire country Can be a matter of contemplation
 muddon ko bhale na jagah mil rahi ho magar haar-jeet ke hisaab se hi nagarpalika chunaavon ko media main kaaphi mahatv milane laga he
 The BJP has made the panchayat, district council, municipal and municipal elections politically important
 in chunaavon kii raajnneetik khoj yaa phir se khoj kaa kaam bijepi ne kiya he
 BJP throws its full force, campaigning in these elections from national president to MP minister
 iske zariye bijepi badi sankhya main apane kaaryakartaaon kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ko banaae rakhti he
 Activists also feel that they become corporators, they will also become mlas tomorrow
 is tarah se kaaryakartaaon kii fouj ko khapaane kaa yaa sakriy rakhane kaa bijepi ne ek bada hi acha tarika nikaala he
 This strategy has made BJP like a paramilitary force, whose truck is always ready to move to a new location
 emsidi chunaav ke kawarez kaa jo swaroop aapane media main dekha wo bijepi ke kaaran hi he
 Only a few Hindi and English newspapers cover the news of the municipality regularly
 channelon main to na ke baraabar hi emsidi ko jaanane vaale reporter honge
 Even after this, for the first time, news channels have covered the elections and results of MCD like Lok Sabha
 aap yaad kiijie kab 800 karod se bhi kam bajet vaale emsidi ke chunaav ko channelon par itani jagah mili he
 Before this election of MCD, the media used to give importance to the election of Brihan Mumbai Municipality
 30-40 hazaar karod ke bajet ke kaaran or shivasena ke niyantran ke kaaran
 By controlling the BMC, it is the only party in India that maintains its importance at the national level
 abhi bhi kai dal nikaay chunaavon ko mahatv hi nahin dete hai
 BJP has made the body elections high profile
 jo ki hona bhi chahie tha
 The BJP has won the MCD elections for the third consecutive time since 2007, 2012
 congress 2012 kii tulana main aadhe se bhi kam ho gai he
 Won in 30 wards only
 pehali baar chunaav lard rahi aam aadmi party ko 48 ward main jeet mili he
 BJP has won in 181 wards
 uttari emsidi ke 104 main se 64 ward main bijepi vijayi rahi he
 The BJP won 70 of 104 wards of the Southern MCD
 purvi emsidi ke 64 ward main se 48 ward main bijepi jiti he
 BJP has a majority in three corporations

 If you want, you can go to youtube and watch it again and you must have seen it
 bijepi ne das saal main kuch nahin kiya, bhrashtachar or gandagi rahi, phir bhi prachand tareeke se jeet gai
 The BJP cut all its councilors' tickets to avoid heartburn
 pravaktaaon ke jawaab bhi suniyegaa
 Hardly anyone would have said that we got a vote on our ten years of work
 sabane pradhanmantri modi kaa naam liya
 Anchors and experts have repeatedly said that BJP cut tickets for 153 councilors
 ummid karata hum ki chunaav ke dauraan bhi bhrashtachar or gandagi ke sawaalon ko jagah mili hogi
 What to expect from others when they have not done it themselves 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat dene kii ranneeti kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Which was not discussed or reduced
 aisi koun si party he jo 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat de or baghaavat na ho
 Only a few councilors who cut tickets revolted, the rest remained silent
 iske baad bhi party ne 21 netaaon ko baghaavat ke jurm main nikaal diya
 In this context, no party has the courage to do so in today's time
 agar koi dal tikat kaat bhi de to usee kshan wo duusare dal kii sadsyta lete nazar aaenge
 But more than 100 councilors of BJP continued to work for the party even after the ticket was cut
 isse andaaza miltaa he ki ek sanghathan ke rup main bijepi kitni sakriy he or uskaa kitna niyantran he
 But where was the national president of the election-winning party, when such a big victory was being won
 amit shah us bengal main laut gaye hai jahaan pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main unki party ko jeet nahin mili
 At the start of 2016, all the files of Netaji were going public, TV anchors debated Netaji a lot, but BJP got 3 seats
 itani badi haar ke ek saal ke bheetar amit shah bengal laut gaye hai
 In Naxalbari, the party workers are having their meals
 amit shah ke paas jeet kaa jashn manaane or dilli main rahane ke kai kaaran honge, magar ve vahaan padayatra kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah is gearing up for Bengal's local body elections next year
 11 march ko upi vidhansabha main bijepi ko aitihaasik jeet mili lekin uske das din baad media main maine ek khabar dekhi ki amit shah 21 march tamilnadu ke coimbatore jaayenge, aresas kii ek baithak main hissaa lene ke liye
 In 2016, the BJP got zero seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, the vote percentage was 2
 8 pratishat
 Even after this, Amit Shah and his BJP are clashing there
 kya aap vartmaan samay main kisi bhi dal ke adhyaksh ke bare main jaanate hai jo badi jeet ke baad bhi vahaan chalaa jaataa he jahaan use badi haar mili hoti he
 If there was another president in place of Amit Shah, he would not leave Delhi for several months
 yah sahi he ki aaj kii media main bijepi kaa hi paksh rahata he usee ke rang main sawaal hote hai, vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he lekin haar kaa kaaran vipaksh kaa aalasy bhi he
 The people of India have no problem with how these elections are being fought, money is being shed like water
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii
 Today, when the opponents and critics were only hoping to accept their defeat, AAP maintained its belief in the malfunction in the electronic voting machine
 survey se lekar tamaam patrakaron ne kaha tha ki aap emsidi haaregi
 When Punjab lost, you said that journalists were also talking about winning
 aam aadmi party kii vidhayak alka lamba ne vidhayaki se istipha de diya he or apane kshetra main haar kii zimmedaari lee he
 Alka says there were other reasons for the defeat that were visible on the ground
 sanyojak dilip pandey ne bhi istipha de diya he
 Similarly, state Congress president Ajay Maken also resigned after the defeat
 prabharee pisi chaako ne bhi istipha de diya he
 If someone who has resigned has missed the name, then i apologize with an ear
 ab problem ye he ki jin par in istifon ke sweekaar karne kii zimmedaari he, unase bhi to istipha maanga ja rahaa he
 In my opinion, there should be a resignation secretary in every party who has the power to accept the resignation from the Speaker to the MLA
 emsidi chunaav main aam aadmi party ke alaava ek or party pehali baar hissaa le rahi thi, jo usee se nikali hui he, swaraj india

 dilli kii janata ne sabit kar diya ki use sirf achchhai nahin chahie
 Since the morning, Arvind was doing phd on Kejriwal's arrogance, if he had such a call for humility, he should have seen Yogendra Yadav's tweet, and could have asked Delhi what was lacking in Yogendraji's humility, which even a single seat Not found subah- subah unka twit aayaa ki emsidi kii ginati shuru ho rahi he
 I'm starting with zero expectations
 iske alaava jo bhi aayega wo bonus hoga
 Where is such a language now left in politics but even with such a language, there is no vote, yet you cannot say that there is no Sharafat left in Indian politics
 nattejey aane ke baad swaraj india ke yogendra yadav ne ek or twit kiya, ummid ke anusaar swaraj india ko koi seat nahin mili
 The vote share numbers are yet to come, but it seems less than expected
 hamen bhi aatmamanthan karne kii zarurat he
 The comments ant main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke twit main bhi vinamrata kii jhalak mili
 i congratulate the BJP on victory in all three mcds, my government is ready to work with the MCD for the betterment of Delhi
 muddon par chunaav hua yaa nahin, ab is par baat karne se koi phayda nahin he
 This victory is also for 46 percent of the people who did not cast their votes

 This victory is also for 46 percent of the people who did not cast their votes
 emsidi ke chunaavon main bijepi 2007, 2012 ke baad lagaataar teesri baar jiti he
 The Congress has fallen by less than half compared to 2012
 30 ward main hi jeet mili
 The Aam Aadmi Party, contesting for the first time, has won 48 wards
 bijepi ko 181 ward main jeet mili he
 BJP has been victorious in 64 wards out of 104 of the Northern MCD
 dakshini emsidi ke 104 main se 70 ward main bijepi jiti he
 BJP won 48 of the 64 wards of the Eastern MCD
 teen nigamon main bijepi ko bahumat hasil he
 Today, during the analysis of the results of the MCD on several channels, the questions from the anchor, reporter and experts were mainly two questions
 aap chahen to you tub par jaakar phir se dekh bhi sakate hai or aapane dekha hi hoga
 The BJP did nothing in ten years, there was corruption and filth, yet it won in a fierce manner
 bijepi ne naaraazgi se bachane ke liye apane sabhi parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 Will also listen to the answers of the spokesmen
 shaayad hi kisi ne kaha hoga ki hamaare das saal ke kaam par vot mila he
 Everyone named Prime Minister Modi
 ankaron or jaankaron ne baar-baar kaha ki bijepi ne 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 i hope that the questions of corruption and filth have got place during the election also
 jab khud hi nahin kiya to dusron se kya ummid
 There is another aspect of the 153 councilors' ticket-cutting strategy
 jisaki charchaa nahin hui yaa kam hui
 Which is the party that cuts the ticket of 153 councilors and does not rebel
 tikat katane vaale chand parshadon ne hi baghaavat kii, baaki shant hi rahe
 Even after this, the party expelled 21 leaders in rebellion
 is lihaaz se dekhenge to aaj ke samay main aisa karne kii himmat kisi bhi dal main nahin he
 Even if one party cuts the ticket, then at that moment they will be seen subscribing to the other party
 magar bijepi ke 100 se adhik parshad tikat katane ke baad bhi party ke liye kaam karte rahe
 This gives an idea of how active BJP is as an organization and how much control it has
 lekin chunaav dar chunaav jeetne vaali party ke rashtriya adhyaksh kahaan the, jab itani badi jeet mil rahi thi
 Amit Shah has returned to Bengal where his party did not win the assembly elections held last year
 2016 shuru hote hi netaji kii tamaam filein saarvajanik hone lagi thim, tivi ankaron ne netaji khub bahes kii, lekin bijepi ko seat mili 3
 Within a year of such a huge defeat, Amit Shah has returned to Bengal
 naksalbari main party kaaryakarta ke ghar bhojan kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah will have many reasons to celebrate the victory and stay in Delhi, but he is walking there
 amit shah agle saal bengal ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 The BJP won a historic victory in the UP Assembly on March 11, but ten days later i saw a news in the media that Amit Shah would go to Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu on March 21 to attend an RSS meeting
 2016 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main bijepi ko zero seat mili thi, mat pratishat tha 2
 8 percent
 iske baad bhi amit shah or unki bijepi vahaan bhidi hui he
 Do you know of the president of any party at the present time who goes to a place where he has suffered a big defeat even after a big win
 amit shah kii jagah agar koi doosraa adhyaksh hota to kai maheene tak dilli se hi nahin nikalataa
 It is true that in today's media there is only the bjp's side, there are questions in its color, the opposition is mocked but the reason for the defeat is also the laziness of the opposition
 chunaav kaise ladaa ja rahaa he, ladane par paisa pani kii tarah bahaya ja rahaa he in sab baton se bharat kii janata ko koi takalif nahin he
 Now the talk of the Aam Aadmi Party
 aaj jab virdohi or aalochak sirf itani ummid kar rahe the ki apni haar sweekaar kar le, magar aap ne electronic voting mashin main gadabadi par apana vishwaas banaae rakhaa
 All journalists from the survey had said that you will lose the MCD
 punjab haarane par aap ne yahi to kaha tha ki patrkaar bhi aap ke jeetne kii baat kar rahe the
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Alka Lamba has resigned from the legislature and claimed responsibility for defeat in her constituency
 alka kaa kahana he ki haar ke or bhi kaaran the jo zamin par dikh rahe the
 Convenor Dilip Pandey has also resigned
 usee tarah se congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan ne bhi haar ke baad istipha de diya
 In-charge PC Chacko has also resigned
 agar istipha dene vaale kisi kaa naam chhot gaya ho to main kaan pakad kar maafee maangata hum
 Now the problem is that those who have the responsibility of accepting these resignations, resignation is also being sought from them
 meri raay main har dal main ek istipha sachiv hona chahie jiske paas adhyaksh se lekar vidhayak tak kaa istipha sweekaar karne kaa power ho
 Apart from the Aam Aadmi Party, another party was taking part in the MCD elections for the first time, which has emerged from the same, Swaraj India
 117 mahilaon ko tikat diya, paryaavaran ko mudda banaaya
 The people of Delhi proved that it does not just want goodness
 subah se jaankaar arvind kejariwal ke anhakaar par piechdi kar rahe the, agar unhen vinamrata kii itani hi talab thi to yogendra yadav kaa twit dekhnaa chahie tha, or dilli se puch sakate the ki yogendra ji kii vinamrata main aisi kya kami thi jo ek bhi seat nahin mili
 In the morning, his tweet came that the counting of MCD is starting
 main shunya apekshaaon ke saath shuru kar rahaa hum
 Apart from this, whatever comes will be a bonus
 raajnneeti main aisi bhashaa ab kahaan bachi he lekin aisi bhashaa se bhi vot nahin mila, phir bhi aap ye nahin kah sakate ki bharat kii raajnneeti main sharafat nahin bachi he
 After the results, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India tweeted another, Swaraj India did not get any seat as expected
 abhi tak vot share ke number nahin aae hai, par ummid se kam lag rahaa he
 We also need to introspect
 tippaniyan Finally, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's tweet also showed a glimpse of humility
 main bijepi ko teenon emsidi main vijay par badhai detaa hum, meri sarkaar dilli kii behatari ke liye emsidi ke saath milakar kaam karne ke liye taiyaar he
 There is no use talking on issues or not, now the election took place
 yah jeet un 46 fisadi logon kii bhi he, jinhone vot nahin daale
 Today, during the analysis of the results of the MCD on several channels, the questions from the anchor, reporter and experts were mainly two questions
 aap chahen to you tub par jaakar phir se dekh bhi sakate hai or aapane dekha hi hoga
 The BJP did nothing in ten years, there was corruption and filth, yet it won in a fierce manner
 bijepi ne naaraazgi se bachane ke liye apane sabhi parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 Will also listen to the answers of the spokesmen
 shaayad hi kisi ne kaha hoga ki hamaare das saal ke kaam par vot mila he
 Everyone named Prime Minister Modi
 ankaron or jaankaron ne baar-baar kaha ki bijepi ne 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 i hope that the questions of corruption and filth have got place during the election also
 jab khud hi nahin kiya to dusron se kya ummid
 There is another aspect of the 153 councilors' ticket-cutting strategy
 jisaki charchaa nahin hui yaa kam hui
 Which is the party that cuts the ticket of 153 councilors and does not rebel
 tikat katane vaale chand parshadon ne hi baghaavat kii, baaki shant hi rahe
 Even after this, the party expelled 21 leaders in rebellion
 is lihaaz se dekhenge to aaj ke samay main aisa karne kii himmat kisi bhi dal main nahin he
 Even if one party cuts the ticket, then at that moment they will be seen subscribing to the other party
 magar bijepi ke 100 se adhik parshad tikat katane ke baad bhi party ke liye kaam karte rahe
 This gives an idea of how active BJP is as an organization and how much control it has
 lekin chunaav dar chunaav jeetne vaali party ke rashtriya adhyaksh kahaan the, jab itani badi jeet mil rahi thi
 Amit Shah has returned to Bengal where his party did not win the assembly elections held last year
 2016 shuru hote hi netaji kii tamaam filein saarvajanik hone lagi thim, tivi ankaron ne netaji khub bahes kii, lekin bijepi ko seat mili 3
 Within a year of such a huge defeat, Amit Shah has returned to Bengal

 Imran Khan, who is leading in the race to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan, will always have the first identity as the cricket captain who had the potential to make the impossible possible on the field
 or jisane apni team ko vishwa vijeta banane kaa khwab dikhaaya or puraa bhi kiya
 There was no dearth of Indian fans in the eighties, but there was only one leader on the cricket field and that was Imran Khan
 yah vah daur tha, jab bhartiya team aksar pakistan se haar jaaya karti thi
 In October and November, Indian cricket fans used to think that i wish i was sitting in front of my black and white television in the sunshine of television
 Imran would have been their captain
 captain ke taur par imran khan--1982-1992 ke dauraan 48 test main captaini kii, 14 jite , 8 haare (test main misbah ul haq ke baad javed miyandad ke saath sanyukt rup se pakistan ke duusare safal captain)-1982-1992 ke dauraan 139 vanade main captaini kii, 75 jite, 59 haare ( vanade main pakistan ke sabase safal captain)sanjay manjrekar bhi rahe fansanjay manjrekar ne apni aatmakatha â€˜imparfectâ€™ main likhaa tha ki agar imran khan unke captain hote, to vah behatar cricketer hote
 Imran, who was an all-round all-rounder in his time, was a world class fast bowler, but the accolades he earned on the strength of his captaincy brought him to a different place
 bharat ke purv spinner maninder singh ne kaha,â€˜vah captain, coach, mukhya chayankarta sabhi kuch the
 He was a connoisseur of talent and also very stubborn

 Emraan, who studied from Oxford, had a different personality
 wasim akram unase zyada kalatmak gendbaaj the, lekin agar imran unke sarparast nahin hote, to kariyar main vah is mukaam tak nahin pahunch pate
 Akram was called the Sultan of Reverse Swing, who learned this art from Imran
 ek din tivi par gharelu match dekhte hue imran ne yuva tej gendbaaj ko dekha
 He asked the PCB officials to find out about him
 vah ladkaa vakaar younus tha
 inzamam-ul-haq was also the discovery of Imran, who was the star of the 1992 World Cup

 He said, "A score of 168 is not enough but we should compete
 spinneron ne aaj shandaar khel dikhaaya lekin meraa main of da match hamaare kshetrarakshak hai
 " pakistani captain misbah ul haq ne kaha, "bhartiya khilaadiyon ne bahut acchhee gendbaaji kii or unka kshetrarakshan to laajawab rahaa
 Our effort was to face the new ball properly and overcome it, but even when old, the ball was spinning and swinging
 ran bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 " is mukaable main bhartiya ballebaajon ne ek baar phir niraash kiya lekin gendbaajon va kamaal ke kshetrarakshan ne team kii laaj rakh lee
 Led by Ishant Sharma (36 / 3), India bowled Pakistan's hopes of sweeping the series by defeating Pakistan by 10 runs thanks to the courageous performance of their bowlers and the relentless hard work of fielders
 pakistan ne yah shrunkhlaa 2-1 se jarur jeet lee
 This victory has given the Indian team a chance to smile in the new year as they were defeated by Pakistan in the final match of 2012 (twenty20)
 iske baad nae saal 2013 ke pehle match (ekadivasiy) main pakistan ne bharat ko kolkata main parajeet kiya
 India had a target of 168 runs in front of Pakistan
 yah lakshya aisa nahin tha, jise lekar pakistan ko chintaa karne kii jarurat thi kyonki uske ballebaaj shandaar farm main the lekin bhartiya gendbaajon ne pakistan ke liye kathin halaat paidaa kiye or match usase chin liya

 Umar Akmal scored 25 runs
 chot ke kaaran pari kii shuruyaat se maharoom rahe mohammad hafeez ne antim samay main ishanth kii gendon par do chauke lagaakar pakistan ko lakshya tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya lekin 49wein over kii paanchavin gend par vah midwicket main yuvaraj ke haathon lapke gaye
 Due to the efforts of Nasir, Misbah and Umar, it seemed that India would lose all the matches of their ODI series in their home country after 1983-84, but the bowlers avoided the possibility of turning it into a reality
 isse pehle, haad kampa dene vaali sardi ke bich bhartiya team ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue 43

 The toss was considered important in this match as there was moisture in the weather

 There are tremendous reactions to Alok Nath on Twitter
 alok nath (alok Nath) par riter vinata nanda ne rape ke aarope lagaae the
 But as soon as Alok Nath is seen in the film, the issue of # metoo has once again gained momentum
 Only thing tat surprised me in this movie is # Aloknath
 # Bollywood continues it's double standard
 Then why not bring back sajid khan and nana patekar and many others
 Wat a shame tat we have to see this rapist aloknathdifference between @akshaykumar nd @ajaydevgn

 So, now how # aloknath is still part of @ajaydevgn starrer movie # dedepyaarde ???

 Not only this, although Ajay Devgan was asked about Alok Nath during the trailer launch, he had said that the film was ready before that incident, and this forum is not to ask that question

 Luv Ranjan, who wrote the story of the film Pyaar Ka Panchanama, is the storyteller for the film

 But one name that is discussed in these elections is Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 siddharmaiya lagaataar bijepi par hamalavar hai, to vahiin bijepi ke nishane par bhi wo hai
 But meanwhile, there is also a village in Karnataka where there are not one, not two, but 30 Siddaramaiah
 ji, karnataka kaa siddharamagudi gaanv jo mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kaa hi gaanv he
 There are many children here whose name is Siddaramaiah
 kabhi-kabhi to aisa bhi hota he ki agar gaanv main cricket team bane to 11 khilaadi hi siddharmaiya hi hote hai
 Sometime ago when this village was seated at Siddharamaikanikale and the highest position of the state, then there was a trend that everyone wanted to name their child Siddaramaiah
 lekin har koi bhi aisa nahin karnaa chahta he
 When our team asked 5-year-old Siddaramaiah if he ever wanted to be a VIP
 to usne bas itnaa kaha ki shaayad, abhi main vaisaa hi mahasoos kar rahaa hum

 balaatkaari baba ram rahim kii khaas raajadaar haniprit insaan ke jail kii salaakhon ke peeche pahunchate hi usase jude raaj ek-ek karke baahar aa rahe hai
 How much Honeypreet used to burn with Ram Rahim's family has become clear from a video recently surfaced
 isamen vah gurmeet ram rahim kii patni kaa haath jhatak kar uske bal thik karte hue dikhaai de rahi he
 She was not only jealous and hated of Ram Rahim's wife Harjeet Kaur, but also kept trying to keep Baba away from her family
 ab ram rahim ke parivaar ke prati haniprit insaan kii ek bahut badi sajeesh kaa pardaafash hua he
 Honeypreet's hand is also behind the demolition of Ram Rahim's son Jasmeet Insan
 vah jasmit kii haisiyat ko mitti main milaanaa chaahati thi
 Due to this, he closed Jasmeet's factories under a conspiracy and later took over all his business
 haniprit ko jasmit se tab jalan hone lagi, jab ek baar ram rahim ne achaanak use apana vaaris ghoshit kar diya tha
 Honeypreet did not want Jasmeet to become the heir of Ram Rahim
 isi jalan ke chalate usne apane fasebuk acount main ek baar khud ko apane aap hi ram rahim kaa vaaris ghoshit kar diya tha
 Ram Rahim, who was trapped in Honeypreet's lovemaking, used to consider everything in her as a stone streak
 ram rahim kii isi kamajori ke chalate haniprit ne us par saal 2011 ke baad yah kahkar dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya tha ki jasmit kii factriyon main ban rahe biscuit, achaar or duusare utpaada ghatiya hai
 His factories should be closed
 fadar or king thri naam se nikaale nae utpadajasamit ne saal 1998 main fadar naam se biscuit kii ek factory lagaai thi
 The business, which started with just 50 employees, gradually started growing wings
 jasmit ke biscuit punjab, haryana or rajasthan ke alaava kai shaharon main bikne lage
 After that Jasmeet also started manufacturing Namkeen, Jam, Pickle and other products in his products
 inako king thri ke naam se bazaar main utaara gaya
 According to sources, in 2015, Jasmeet's annual turnover had crossed Rs 15 crore
 jasmit ke khilaaf sajeesh main juty rahi hanipritjasmit se jalane vaali haniprit ko uski safalataa nahin bha rahi thi
 She was busy plotting against him
 vah jasmit kii factriyon main bane biscuit, namakeen, achaar, jam or duusare utpaadon ko ghatiya bataa kar use badnaam karne main lag gai
 Jasprit's business slowly started to shrink due to Honeypreet's plot
 haniprit ne aakhir saal 2015 main jasmit kii sabhi factriyaan band karvaa deen
 Jasmeet tried hard to save his business, but he could not succeed in it
 jasmit kii company band karakar banaaya msgsawira haniprit ne saal 2015 main jasmit kii factriyon main bane sabhi utpaada waapas mangava liye
 In the year 2016, by creating a company named MSG under the name of Ram Rahim, all the brands and businesses of Jasmeet were merged into the new company
 MSG samooh kii sabhi companiyon kii kaman haniprit ke haathon main thi
 Jasmeet had nothing to do with them
 haalanki ram rahim ke jail pahunchate hi MSG samooh band padaa he, kyonki deraa ke paas kaccha maal kharidne or 70 lakh rupee bijli kaa bhugtan karne ke liye nahin he
 According to the bad hats of all MSG group companies, Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Honeypreet used to sell MSG products marketed as organic, whereas most of these products were not organic
 ab ram rahim kaa sara kaala kaarobaar thap padaa he
 After his reality was revealed, buyers of his products have now shied away from him
 in utpaadon ko bechney vaale dhire-dhire apni dukaane band kar rahe hai
 Overall, all the MSG group companies formed under the conspiracy have suffered badly
 uski factriyaan bhi ab band ho chuki hai
 Honeypreet Man neither Baba, nor Mayahanipreet did not only want to capture the entire Maya of Gurmeetram Rahimbalki Dera
 darasal haniprit na keval deraa main aane vaale chadhaave par balki deraa ke puure kaarobaar ko hadapna chaahati thi
 Due to this conspiracy, all factories of Jasmeet Insan were closed
 use jasmit kii tarakkee se chadh thi taaki vah kisi bhi tarah deraa kaa vaaris na ban paae
 But see the game of luck, Honeypreet did not get Baba nor her illusion
 kabhi ek rani kii tarah jindagi bitaane vaali haniprit insaan aaj ore se jail ke farsh par aa giri he

 The banks of the country can still be cheated in the ways that scamsters like Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parikh have taken

 What has been done in the name of financial security in the government banks of the country already struggling with the problem of npas is clear from the fact that during the last two-three decades, one scam after another in the same manner
 The chiefs of the court come in, resort to banking rules and defraud the amount of crores

 Read this: PNB Mahaghotala! 30 out of every 100 rupees you deposited in the bank? In 2001, Ketan Parikh used a similar inter bank pay order of Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank (MMCB) to pay on the BSE Stock Exchange
 paarikh ne bhi in pe orders ke liye paryaapt security bank ke paas nahin rakhi thi or ant main bank ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 However, the bank refused to accept Parikh's pay order when it did not have sufficient funds for payment

 Mehta, along with his colleagues, made payments to purchase shares by resorting to this bank's credit
 lekin jab bainkon ke paas apana fund khatm hone laga tab unhone mehta or uske saathiyon se rakam vasuulne kaa kadam uthaaya
 However, the bank's balance sheet and the stock market's movement weakened until the bank stepped in

 Sex is considered one of the happiest moments of life
 agar sex sahi dhang se kiya jaye, topartner ke saath bistar par bitaaye 'wo lamhe'kisi eksrasij yaa yoga se behatar sabit ho sakate hai
 Ektija Research has shown that well done sex with a partner is more beneficial than yoga
 jivan ke tanaav ko kam karne ke liye sex se badhia or koi duusari dawa nahin he
 Not only this, if you have sex in a special pose with your partner in bed, then the circulation of blood throughout the body is very fast, which is very beneficial for the heart
 research ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par bataaya gaya he ki adhiktar mahilaaye sex ke dauraan apana focus nahin rakh paati hai, jisase unhen sex sirf ek maamuli kaam lagata he yaa phir yun kahen ki bor karata he
 This is the reason that if those special moments of life are done properly, both you and your partner definitely get the climax
 sex karne se pehle forple kaa bhi behad ahm role hota he
 Know some important tips, through which you will not only make those moments memorable, but it will also prove to be a better exercise for you
 Start at the top of the hips
 -apni garm saanson se apane partner ko apni taraf khinchne kii koshish karen or apane badan ko upar uthaaen
 -lighten the feet to rest on the soles, and by moving around, try to gently lower your waist with your partner's lower abdomen
 aisa 6 baar karen or har baar apni gati ko badhaate jaayen
 Then see what the effect is

 Citigroup, which was facing financial crisis, was announced to provide financial assistance to the US government on Sunday
 yadhyapi sarkaar kii ore se pandit ko tatkaal citigroup ke siio ke pad se hataane kii baat nahin kahi gai he lekin samachar patr waal street jarnal kaa maananaa he ve puri tarah surakshit nahin he or der-saber unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 According to the newspaper, Kenneth Chenault's name is prominent among the names being considered
 patr ke anusaar pandit ko tatkaal isliye nahin hataaya gaya kyonki isse bazaar main galat sandesh jaataa lekin der saber unki vidaai sambhav he
 Rambahadur Raihira is a stone, but priceless
 aisa kyon he? kyonki uski tikne kii kshamta sabase zyada hoti he
 Assuming this as a theory, we can say that Mahatma Gandhi would be known as a diamond among humans
 ve ashariri hai
 Still everywhere, on the strength of his long karmic life and thought
 unke jivan sandesh ko samajhane-jaanane kii lalak badi he
 His life message is in the sutra
 ek vaakya main he
 The talisman he gave is a bit long
 use padhgaye main kuch vakt lagata he
 But one can easily remember his life message like a mantra
 use hameshaa yaad rakh saktaa he
 Gandhiji has told him on many occasions that 'my life is my message'
 ' sewagram kaa aitihaasik vivaran jin do moti pustakon main chapa he, unke cover par gandhi ji kaa jivan sandesh bhi he
 The question is, what is the text of his life message? Has the RSS understood his life message? This question may also seem strange but timely and extremely important because the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has overshadowed Indian life
 ek 'shaktipunj' ban gaya he
 Whether or not his presence is desired, his 'power' is unaffected by anyone wanting or not wanting it
 aise rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se poocha hi janaa chahie ki desh or duniya jab mahatma gandhi-150 ko unhen aatmsaat karne ke liye manaa rahi he to vah kya kar rahaa he? beete saal 17,18,19 sitambar ko dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main ek vyaakhyanmala hui
 The speakers were Dr
 mohan bhagwat
 He is the Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 unhen sunne ke liye aturata thi
 Vigyan Bhawan had become small
 ve bole, prashnon ke uttar die
 Probably no dispute arose for the first time
 vivaad kaa sangh se naata bahut purana he
 In the questions that were asked to him, no one asked why the Sangh wants to follow Gandhiji's path? Why did this happen? One reason for this may be that it is assumed that the Sangh has adopted Gandhiji
 iske ulat bhi ho saktaa he
 The second thing to know
 vah yah ki mahatma gandhi or sangh ke sambandh kab-kab bane or usase sangh ne kya siikhaa or gandhi vichaar ko apanaaya? ek vivaad sangh main he
 The second dispute is outside the union
 puure vivaad kaa yahi do vibhaajan karen to baat thodi saral ho jaaegi
 Gandhi is seen more in the Union from the point of view of hindu-muslim relations
 duusare sangh ko rajnatik drushti se dekhte rahe hai
 On this basis, the Sangh came under attack, even if they were unfounded
 un akshepon ko ginane kii jarurat nahin he
 Everyone knows him
 mahatma gandhi kii apil par asahyog andolan or savinay avagya andolan main jail kaatane vaale dow
 There is 'dialogue and controversy from the beginning' on the question of why Hedgewar created the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 khilaafat andolan se bhavishya main jo dushprinaam ho saktaa he, use na hone dene ke liye dow
 Hedgewar left the Congress and pioneered a national movement
 vahi samay he jab mahatma gandhi congress kii kaman sanbhaalane ja rahe the
 In order to connect the Congress of elite citizens and lawyers with the common people, he associated Congress with the Indian civilizational roots of Swarajya
 satahi taur par mahatma gandhi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii raah samanaantar he, jo kahin milti nahin he
 Dr
 headgavar krantikariyon ke sampark main hai to mahatma gandhi ahimsa kii nishtha par adig
 It is a parallel stream
 par gahare utren to donon kaa strot ek he
 He is in a revolution
 ise sangh ke ek vichaar purush ne swadhyay se samajha
 They were - Baba Saheb Apte
 ve rishitulya the
 With his efforts, the Sangh included Mahatma Gandhi's name in the morning prayer
 baat 1964 kii he
 He often said that Mahatma Gandhi was the soul of India and Veer Savarkar's body
 phir poochhate the ki bhala bina sharir ke aatma kaa kya hoga?sangh kii mahatma gandhi se muslim prashn par asahmati bani hui he
 Despite this disagreement, Drs
 headgavar ne mahatma gandhi ko maan diya
 The literature of the Sangh in his time reflects his respect for Mahatma Gandhi despite policy opposition
 dow
 Hedgewar and Mahatma Gandhi first met in 1934
 asprishyata nivaaran ke liye apni deshvyapee yatra puri kar jab gandhiji ne nae prayog kaa vichaar banaaya to sewagram ko chunaa
 He was living in Wardha
 jamanalaal bajaj ke mehmaan the
 On his request, he went to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh camp
 dow
 There is only one chapter in this in Hedgewar's biography, a meeting with Gandhiji
 lekhak narayan hari paalkar hai
 On the day Gandhiji went to the camp and spoke to the volunteers, Dr
 headgavar nahin the
 He met the next day
 iskaa ullekh gandhi vadmay main he
 At the prayer meeting of 12 September 1947, Gandhiji is appealing to Hindus and Muslims to maintain peace
 usee prasang main unka ek vaakya he ki ''musalamaanon ko pakistan chahie tha, unhen mil gaya
 Why fight now? If Pakistan is found, will we take all India? That is never going to happen
 ''duusari taraf rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke bare main kehete hai ki ''maine suna tha ki sangh ke haath bhi khun se sane hue hai
 Guruji assured me that this is a lie
 unki sanstha kisi kii dushman nahin he
 
 
 
 
 She wants to protect India with all her strength
 '' unheen dinon gandhiji rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii raily main bhi gaye
 There he said that 'I do not know whether there is any truth in the allegations against the Sangh
 yah sangh kaa kaam he ki vah apane susangat kaamon se in aaropon ko jhootha sabit kar de
 'three incidents of modern history have made Mahatma Gandhi a subject of unpleasant debate
 bharat vibhaajan ko unki sweekruti, pakistan ko 55 karod rupye dilaane kii jid or jawaharlal nehru ko apana rajnatik uttaradhikari ghoshit karnaa, ye ve udhaaharan hai jo sahi sandarbh main samajhe jane kii maang karte hai
 If there is a healthy and balanced debate for this, two things will definitely come out of it
 ek ki congress ne gandhi ji ko aazaadee aate-aate asahaay bana diya tha, haalanki unke naam kaa jap jari rakhaa
 Why did this happen? Who did it? What could have been different and enjoyable than what happened was that Gandhi would have had the opportunity to experiment with what he had thought for himself
 agar aisa hota to duusari baat bhi itihaas main darj hoti
 That is, Gandhi would take the support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in whatever work he did to establish the self-rule of his dream in the same way that Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan talked to Bala Saheb Deoras and sought cooperation for the movement
 gandhi ji kii hatya ne is ugantarkari sambhaavna ko samaapt to nahin kiya, lekin gandhi vichaar ke vaastavik vaahak par banjh bahes kaa nayaa adhyay avashya aarambh kar diya
 Divide Gandhijan into three parts
 sarkari, mathi or kujaat
 In the fourth comes the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 gandhiji bataa gaye hai ki ek hi vishay par ve aakhri baar jo bole, vah hi pramanik he
 It has generally been forgotten
 aakhri baar unhone congress ko bhang kar locasevak sangh banane or uski paanch sansthaaon kii rachana kaa praaroop diya tha
 In which Khadi, Village Industries, Goseva, prevention of untouchability and education were the subjects
 isi tarah hind swaraj main bhale hi unhone vakil, doctor or sansad ko nakaara ho lekin unhone hi 1934 se congress ko sansadeey raajnneeti main badhaayaa
 At the time of the announcement of economic liberalization, the person who appealed for the Swadeshi campaign was the then Sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras
 yah baat alag he ki bhaajapa sarkaron ke banane par swadeshi abhiyaan ko sangh ne bahut gahare coldstorage main pahunchaa diya
 The memory of Dharmapala in the year of Gandhi-150 is very natural
 unhone sangh ko gandhi vichaar ke kareeb pahunchaaya
 Dharmapal inspired intellectuals and youths from the Sangh besides the Gandhi idea
 afsos he ki us prerana se koi andolan nahin niklaa
 If we find the reason for this, it will be known that the RSS did not take the initiative
 gandhi ke kuch vichaaron kaa samavesh kiya
 That is not enough
 sangh ke kaam karne kaa jo tarika he vah sansthagat he
 The truth is also that there remains an inescapable gap between the Sangh leadership and the volunteers towards the Gandhi idea
 haa, kuch apwaad bhi he
 But there is also the belief that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has faith in the Hindu nation and its followers can never be secular
 is aadhaar par sangh ko jo dekhte hai, ve use gandhi virdohi maan baithte hai
 Here is the question of understanding of secularism
 uski ek samaj pashchim se nikalati he to duusari bharat kii sanathan parampara se
 Simply say that in the Marxist interpretation of Gandhi thought, the Sangh will remain anti-gandhi
 sanathan parampara main gandhi vichaar ko maanane waalon main sangh bhi hoga
 India is and has been a society of diversities
 jo ise vibhinnata maanate hai ve jo bhi kahen, par gandhiji ko samaj nahin sakenge
 Even for the reconstruction of the state system, the work on Gandhiji's idea of panchayat should not be seen
 sangh ise ek andolan kaa rup chaahe to de saktaa he
 Its base land was built by Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan even before the seventh decade of the last century
 gandhi-150 main iskaa nimantran he

" is bare main kisi tarah kii atkal yaa ashanka kii koi vajah nahin he
 The central government has not initiated any process on this issue, we have not even gone to court

 5

 yuvaaon ke bhavishya ko lekar pradhanmantri sahit ham sabhi chintit hai
 The Home Minister said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir want to make their fortune and future with their hard work

 â€™ The Indian Army and the common citizens of India have paid a great price for Kashmir since independence
 kashmir ko bharat apana abhinn ghoshit kar chukaa he or is ke liye pakistan se do baar ladaai bhi kar chukaa he jisamen pakistan ko munh kii khaani padi he
 But the surprising thing is that the Indian Army pays land rent in Kashmir in pok
 maamle ke prakaash main aane ke baad sibiai ne maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 According to the FIR registered in the case, the CBI is investigating that for the last 16 years, the army was paying rent of four parts of land in pok

 It is not yet clear whether the rent was paid to one person or divided among several people
 sibiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki is ghotaale main sena ke kuch varisht adhikari bhi shaamil hon
 According to the information so far, the exchequer suffered a loss of six lakh rupees
 exiar main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki sena ne nagarikon se yah jameen adhigrahit kii thi
 The board approved the rent after examining the land
 lekin adhikariyon ke board ne ek duusare ke sathganth kar jaanch main galat jaankaree di thi

 Excerpts from the same interview: Question - What is the secret of the success you have achieved in playing such a long innings in politics? Answer - i am nothing without public confidence
 unhone mere kaam ko saraahaa or mujhe apni seva ke avasar dete rahe
 Question- What was your biggest achievement as Chief Minister? Answer - Today, Sikkim is a clean, prosperous state where you will not get poverty
 duusari sabase badi uplabdhi rahi ki aaj sikkim bhaavnaatmak rup se bharat ke saath judaa he
 When i came to power, i gave the slogan in 1994: "desh hamara Hindustan, Sikkim our sukhistan"
 uttar-purv ke anya sabhi rajyon main se sikkim sarvaadhik shant he
 We are preparing a new law in which basic necessities - homes, water, electricity, roads, schools and hospitals - will be given the status of legal rights of the people and the government and local administration will be obliged to provide this to the public
 sawaal-apni ab tak kii rajnatik yatra ke bare main bataaen
 Answer - i was born in a poor family and i could not even complete my schooling
 maine police vibhaag main ek riter-consteble ke rup main teen saal tak naukari kii par baad main chhod di kyonki main apane gaanv ke logon ke liye kuch karnaa chahta tha
 i entered politics in 1985 and became an MLA
 1989 main dobaaraa vidhayak chunaa gaya
 i received 96 percent of the votes of my region
 shapath grahan ke dauraan jab meraa naam pukaara gaya to jitani taaliyaan baji utani to tatkaaleen mukhyamantri nar bahadur bhandari kaa naam pukaare jane par bhi nahin baji thim
 He was irritated by this and removed me from his cabinet after two years
 maine apni party banaai
 Bhandari had several false cases registered against me
 teen maheene ke liye main bhumigat ho gaya or agrim jamaanat ke aadesh ke saath hi saamne aayaa
 On 9 September 1992, i lit a candle in the assembly and wandered throughout the House searching for democracy
 siem kii kursi ke paas pahunchakar maine kaha, "is mombatti kii roshni main ab mujhe loktantr ke hatyare kii surat najar aa rahi he

 The heart must also be large to sit on a large chair
 sawaal-prati vyakti aay ke lihaaj se sikkim desh main sabase zyada aay vaale pradeshon main he
 Less than 10 percent of the people are below the poverty line
 vikaas kaa model kya rahaa he?jawaab-main sikkim ko bas ek upabhokta rajya ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahta
 Our model of development is based on the rich use of human resources and natural resources
 icoturism ke launch ke saath isaki shuruyaat hui or hamane ise sthaneey samskruti ko protsaahan dene kii bhaavana ke saath joda
 a separate step was to make the state organic

 This not only strengthened the rural economy but also increased the average age of the people by ten years
 yadi ham rasinic khaadon kaa istemaal roak denge to carbon-dioxide kaa utsarjan apane aap ghatane lagegaa
 We hope that in the next five years we will be fully self-sufficient in terms of grain production
 vikaas kabhi bhi paryaavaran kii keemat par nahin ho saktaa
 There are many power projects in Sikkim but for this only seven families had to be displaced in the construction of the required dams
 jabase main satta main aayaa hum rajya main van kshetra main chaar pratishat kaa ijapha hua he
 Question- Your opponents say that there was no attempt to create enough job opportunities in the state
 jawaab-vikaas dar badi kyonki rajya main pichley dashak main bharpoor audyogic nivesh hua
 The region received tax relief for 10 years between 2007 and 2017 under the north-eastern Industrial Development Policy
 iske tathaa udyogon ke liye anukool saamaajik-rajnatik maahaul kii vajah se udyogon ne teji se vikaas kiya

 main ek kanoon banane ja rahaa hum jisase nijee companiyaan 90 pratishat naukariyaan sthaneey logon ko dene ke liye baadhya ho jaaengi
 If local people are not able, then companies should train them
 sawaal-bhaajapa ke netaa ram madhav kehete hai ki esadf kaa matlab he sikkim dictatorial front
 Answer - People who want to rule Sikkim say so
 main 40 saal se raajnneeti main hum lekin maine yahaan shashan karne kii niyat nahin rakhi balki logon ko shaktishaalee banane kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahaa hum
 When i created the SDF, i announced that as long as i am active in politics, no member of my family will come into politics and i am keeping that promise to this day
 maine pradhanmantri narendra modi se jo vaada kiya he use nibhaaoongaa, samvidhan kaa paalan karuunga or centre sarkaar kaa sahyog karuunga

 Sushma gave a reply in the House before this, a former naval officer, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court for his involvement in espionage and subversive activities
 sushamaa ne sansad ke donon sadanon main kaha, jadhav dwaara koi galat kaam kiye jane kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 In any case, Kulbhushan will be brought back
 is maamle ko pakistan ke saath uthaaya jayega
 On the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, Sushma said that an innocent Indian citizen is being tried to punish him with false charges, India will consider it as a planned murder
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki kulbhushan bilkul nirdosh he or har haal main waapas laane ke liye sarkaar kadam uthaaegi
 During the discussion on the issue, the opposition had also raised the issue before that Kharge said that if Pakistan hangs Jadhav, it will be 'pre-planned murder'

 He was not even given a lawyer to fight his case
 kisi bhi antarrashtriya niyam kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
