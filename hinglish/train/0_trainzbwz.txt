 " After all, who wants to shake Delhi? After all, who wants to scare Delhi? After all, who wants to tell the people of Delhi that, see, we can place a bomb anytime anywhere? And after all, who is the one who is keeping these bombs and directly challenging the Delhi Police that if you can catch it, then what is the biggest and scary question that what is the purpose of placing such bombs in Delhi? is? Yes, Delhi saw the second bomb in five days, but the truth is that both the bombs were so light and minor that they could not take anyone's life even if they leave a big loss from them
 to phir jaan jokhim main daal kar khuleam in bamon ko rakhane ke peeche bam rakhane waalon kaa makasad kya he?paanch dinon main dilli ke do bamon kaa sach jaanane ke liye hamane har pahalu ko khangaal daalaa
 From the Investigative team of police to the reality of the bombs and the bomb keepers, they investigated the matter in depth with all the experts
 somvaar dopaher dilli ek baar phir saham uthi
 The bomb was found in the capital for the second time in five days
 is baar bam dakshini dilli main gargi college ke paas mila
 However, this bomb did not explode
 kyonki usamen datonator hi nahin tha
 And this bomb also became a minor bomb
 par chintaa kii baat ye he ki 1997 main dilli main 13 dhamaake hue the
 Some of the earlier explosions were minor
 par uske baad achaanak chaar bade dhamaake ho gaye
 Are these two minor bombs even the same gesture? Are these pictures the preparation of a big conspiracy
 kya in choti koshishon main chuphi he badi chetavanee
 For the second time in five days, Delhi stood at the mouth of panic
 subah 11 bajkar 55 minute par ek rahgeer ne police control room ko phone kar ek laavaaris bag milane kii jaankaree di
 The policemen of the Delhi Police Control Room, who were patrolling near Gargi College at 11
55 am, caught sight of an unclaimed bag
 bag gargi college ke bas stand par rakhaa tha
 a bomb disposal squad was called in a few minutes
 police kaa shaq sahi niklaa
 The bag contained all the bomb items
 chand minuton main bam nirodhak daste ne ise niskriy kar diya or khatra tal gaya
 However, some things seem to be similar in the conspiracy of the bomb and the bombings in the High Court near Gargi College
 bam milane kaa vakt bhi ek jaisaa hi he
 The bomb was found near Gargi College at 11
55 am and 1 pm in the High Court
 15 minute par dhamaakaa hua tha yani aisa vakt chunaa gaya tha jab bheedbhad zyada hoti he
 Apart from this, the bombs placed in both the places also look similar in many ways
 visphot ke liye gan powder rakhe hue the shaq he ki ye ammonium nitrate ho sakate hai, abhi jaanch ke nattejey nahin aae hai
 Ammonium nitrate was used in the bomb used in the High Court blast
 dono hi bamon main betry kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha fark ye tha ki hai court dhamaake main motorcycle kii betry istemaal hui thi or gargi college main mili bam main do pencil saise kii batriyaan thim
 The bombs placed in both the places were small pieces of wire with a total length of close to two feet
 hai court main hue dhamaake main istemaal bam main salphurik acid, taar or keelein bhi thim jo gargi college ke baahar mili bam main maujuud nahin the
 The biggest difference was the timer
 hoicourt main hue dhamaake main istemaal bam main datonator circuit laga tha jisamen 45 minute kaa time set kiya gaya tha
 While the bomb found on Monday did not have a timer
 yani usamen dhamaakaa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Police is also guessing that it would not have been kept there for the blast
 phir bam rakhane ke peeche aakhir kya tha makasad
 The investigation is still on

 yah nirvachan kshetra anusuchit jati ke liye surakshit he
 Since Ambedkar has the support of the All India majlis-e-ittihad-ul-muslimeen, the 200,000 Muslim votes are divided between him and Shinde

 To give a direct message to this class, now the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh has targeted Gujarat Chief Minister and bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 mayawati ne shuukravaar ko sansad bhawan ke baahar kaha ki main modi kaa piem banane kaa sapana kabhi puraa nahin hone duungi
 According to Mayawati, the Muslim community of the country gets scared in the name of Narendra Modi
 aise main bispi hi puure desh main unase loha legi
 Four parties slip in four days
 When the Left parties withdrew support from the Third Front only, UPA 1, CPM General Secretary Prakash Karat forwarded BSP supremo Mayawati in the name of Dalit face
 magar aaj vahi mayawati prakaash karaat kii nai raajnneetik kavayad tisare morche ko sire se khaarij kar rahi hai
 Mayawati said that you are asking about the third or whatever front, it is very weak
 aaj banaate hai or teen chaar din baad isamen se kuch dal khisak jate hai
 Mayawati clearly said that all this does not matter
 magar sachai yah he ki mayawati aise kisi bhi morche ko kaise sweekaar kar sakati hai, jisamen unke dhur virdohi mulaayam shaamil hai
 Mayawati also feels that if she gets seats beyond 30 on her own, her name may be sneezed and the Third front-congress may mobilize for support
 modi jhooth bolta he, fareb karata he
 On the question related to Narendra Modi, Mayawati, who once ran the government with the support of BJP, adopted a tone
 unhone kaha, ‘dekho narendra modi jo kuch kahata he, to usamen sachai bahut kam hoti he
 There is more lies in it
 fareb zyada hota he
 The public is misled
 isliye jo bijepi ke bare main shuru se kahana rahaa he ki ye kahati kuch he or karti kuch he
 The same is true today
 ’alapa sampradayikta rokane kaa ragasampradayikta ko rokane ke ghir chuke raajnneetik tark kaa istemaal karte hue basapa netri ne kaha ki ham upie kii nitiyon se sahamat nahin he
 But supported UPA 1 and UPA 2 to stop communal forces
 phir apane secular rup ko chamakaane ke liye mayawati ne godhra kaa zikr kiya
 He said, as far as Modi is concerned, Modi means a symbol of promoting communal forces
 ham puri takat lagaayenge puure desh ke andar ki inako satta main aane se roka jaae or narendra modi ko piem banane se roka jaae
 The Godhra incident is not hidden from anyone in Modi's Gujarat State

 And in the name of Narendra Modi, the people of the Muslim community are nervous in the name of Narendra Modi all over the country

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has accused Pakistan of trying to destabilize India by sending terrorists from across the border
 unhone jammu kashmir main surakshabalon se pehle goli nahin chalaane ke liye kaha he, lekin uksaaye jane par goliyaan kii sankhya gine bina javaabi karrwai karne ko bhi kaha
 Addressing a public meeting in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, Rajnath said that Pakistan is not deterring sending terrorists, but India is taking swift action against terrorism
 kendriya grahamantri ne kaha ki sainya balon ko diye nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki pakistan hamaara padosi he, isliye pehle goli mat chalie
 But if a single bullet comes from that side, do not count bullets in retaliation

 unhone sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar kaha ki chunaav keval samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party samvidhan bachaane ke liye saath ai he
 We are not fighting alone
 unhone aage kaha ki hamaare saath haath bhi he hathi bhi
 In the coming Lok Sabha elections, many big big parties including Congress, RLD, Nishad Party are standing
 ham aane vaale chunaav main saath ladenge
 We are a confluence of thoughts
 bijepi ke khilaaf astitv khatm hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Because in Kairana, Gorakhpur, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party together defeated BJP
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ko haath bhi pasand he or hathi bhi
 That is why we are telling BJP that the more MP, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, the more emphasis they are putting on winning seats in UP, they would have won more seats
 ye bhi padhein:upi ke mukhyamantri ek baba hai, unke aashirwad se ham jeetenge: akhilesh yadankhilesh bole- sapa-basapa vichaaron kaa sangam
 
 
 On the question of losing to BJP, Akhilesh said that we are fighting the fight for the constitution
 hamaare vichaar milte hai isliye ham saath khadey hai
 It is a confluence of ideas and not for the benefit of politics
 yadi aap pehle bhi dekhen to ram manohar lohia, bhim raav ambedkar saath ladanaa chaahate the
 Akhilesh said - why coalition government in the country for many decades, call it adulteration
 
 
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahagathbandhan ko mahamilawat kehane ke sawaal par akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki bijepi tamilnadu se northeast tak jo gathbandhan kar rahi he
 It is also adulterated
 tamilnadu main to unka chunaav main kya hashr hua wo to sab hi jaanate hai
 Coalition governments have been in operation in the country for many decades
 gathbandhan karnaa galat nahin he
 Another senior leader of the party, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, clearly stated that he does not support the party's line that BJP is winning elections by rigging evms
 balki chunaav main unke anusaar bhaajapa kaa hindu-muslim rajd ke agada-pichhadaa par baari pad rahaa he
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that the way the BJP is in control of the publicity system and their influence is seen in every program of the government in every village, in the same way you cannot compete with them by making a statement
 raghuvansh prasad singh ne saaf kaha ki party jis prakaar se simatati ja rahi he vaise main satta kaa safar kaaphi mushkil dikh rahaa he
 He said that after the election all people are discouraged but no such program was made which would indicate that efforts are being made to revive the party
 haalanki rajd ke sthapana diwas kaarykram main tej pratap yadav aae or rabari devi bhi maujuud thim lekin lalu yadav ke jail main rahane ke kaaran na to kaaryakartaaon main or na hi netaaon main koi utsaah dikhaa
 Most of the leaders showed a lot of resentment due to the way Tejashwi Yadav avoided the party's program despite being in Patna
 gujarat kaa nayaa mukhyamantri chunane kii prakriya ko gati dete hue bijepi ne buudhvaar ko rajya kii maujuuda mukhyamantri anandiben ko istipha dene kii anumati de di or party adhyaksh amit shah ko vidhayak dal ke saath vimarsh karke anandiben kaa uttaradhikari chunane kaa kaam saunpa

 Shah, the MLA of Gujarat Legislative Assembly, will also attend this meeting
 naidu ne is baat par jor diya ki anandiben kaa uttaradhikari party ke vidhayakon main se hi hoga
 Naidu also dismissed reports that Amit Shah himself could replace Anandiben Patel
 naidu ne kaha ki party ko rashtriya str par unke netritv kii jarurat he, kyonki vah party ko 'bahut oonchaaiyon' tak lekar gaye hai or unke netritv main party ko kai safaltaaen mili hai
 He said that the name of Anandiben's successor was not discussed in the board meeting
 naidu ne kaha, 'sansadeey board ne anandiben patel kii pad chhodane kii ichha ko manjuuri de di he
 She had expressed her desire to retire from her responsibilities, as she would soon be 75 years old

 He has a record of good works as a chief minister and before that as a minister

 Naidu said that this is perhaps unprecedented for a BJP leader
 naidu ne kaha ki nae netaa ke chayan se pehle amit shah vidhaayi dal ke saath vichaar-vimarsh karenge

 The comments jab naidu se amit shah ke mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hone ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha, aisa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 He is and will remain the president of the party

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Senior party leader Venkaiah Naidu told reporters after the BJP parliamentary party meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on Wednesday that Anandiben would submit her resignation to the governor
 board ne vidhayak dal kii baithak ke liye kendriya mantri nitin gadakari or party mahasachiv saroj pandey ko kendriya paryvekshak ke taur par niyukt kiya he
 The new leader will be formally selected in this meeting
 gujarat vidhansabha ke vidhayak shah bhi is baithak main shirkat karenge
 Naidu emphasized that Anandiben's successor would be from the party's mlas
 naidu ne in khabaron ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki khud amit shah anandiben patel kii jagah le sakate hai
 Naidu said that the party needs his leadership at the national level, as he has taken the party to 'great heights' and under his leadership the party has had many successes

 Naidu said, 'the Parliamentary Board has approved Anandiben Patel's desire to step down
 unhone apni jimmedaari se nivrutt hone kii ichha jataai thi, kyonki ve jaldi hi 75 saal kii hone vaali hai
 He has set an example for millions of party workers

 Anandiben has been in the state government for more than 18 years
 naidu ne kaha ki yah ek bijepi netaa ke liye shaayad abhootpurv he
 Naidu said that Amit Shah will consult the legislative party before the new leader is selected
 unhone kaha, 'hamaare adhyaksh bhi ek vidhayak hai
 He will be present in the meeting
 vah vichaar-vimarsh karenge or iske baad uttaradhikari par faisla kiya jayega
 a party source said that the board has given Shah the right to choose a candidate for the post of chief minister
 tippaniyan When Naidu was asked about Amit Shah being the chief ministerial candidate, he said, no such question arises
 vah party ke adhyaksh hai or bane rahenge
 The party needs his leadership at the national level
 aisi koi charchaa nahin hui he
 Nitin Patel, the number two leader in the state cabinet and Vijay Rupani, the head and minister of the Gujarat party, is being considered as the main contender in the race for the successor to Anandiben Patel

 This is the place where the Republic represents its military strength in such a way that the whole world can see its grandeur
 yahi vah jagah he jahaan sardiyon kaa duubataa suraj ghoomane ke shaukeenon ke liye behtareen balldrop muhaiyaa karata he
 This is where the common man who came on the streets demanding justice, is demanding action, not mercy, while challenging the power
 yahi vah marke kii jagah he, jahaan se aap dekh sakate hai ki desh kii siyaasi or sanvaidhanik satta kis tarah udaseenta dikhaa rahi he
 This is India Gate, from where this winter there was a shriek in the fog of December, in which the anger of an entire generation was pitted against the conscience of the frozen ice power
 bairicadon ko tod dene vaali, asahmati main tani hajaaron laharaati mutthiyon ne yaheen us satta main apni tut chuki aasthaa kaa elaan kiya, jiske paas apane bachaav main ek ke baad ek alag-alag sirf pantare maujuud the
 The only chemical weapon used against its own citizens, tear gas bullets, was also thwarted by this mob; He faced lathis; And he refused to be satisfied with the nonsense of the leaders
 ninsaphi se jujhate raashtra main yah nae mukti sangharsh kii ek jhalak bhar thi, jiskaa agua vah naaraaz bhartiya tha jisane ummid kaa daaman to chhod diya he, lekin jiske paas apane gusse kii takat ab bhi baaki he
 This time, the brutality of a girl on the infamous streets of Delhi acted as a spark
 india get par jamaa pradarshnkaree jaanate the ki us ladki ne jo haivaaniyat bhogi he, unka sangharsh uski barabari nahin kar saktaa
 That girl was as young as these protesters, one of the most unlikely population of twenty-first century India, who brought a dream to the capital of possibilities
 lekin yah kahani us raat us bas main chadhgaye se pehle kii he
 It was not just a torture camp
 aap is tathy se munh nahin chura sakate ki jinhone us par julm dhaaya, ve bhi isi yuva aabaadi kaa hissaa the, alabatta unki rihaaish ke dadbe hi unhen nai peedi ke chetanasampann yuvaaon se alag karte the
 This time the young hands raised in the demand for justice were so spontaneous that no revolutionary force fighting for civil rights could sway them
 ve apni aakankshaon, apni chaahaton or aazaadee ke apane khyal se bilkul alahada or bemail us bharat ko khaarij kar rahe the, jahaan ek akeli aurat kaa sadak par chalanaa muhaal he; jahaan sabase kamjor naagarik hinsa kaa sthaayee shikaar hai; jahaan aapaki pahchaan hi aapaki kismat tay karti he, vah langik ho chaahe jaateey; or jahaan ke bazaaron main sabase sasti cheez agar kuch he to wo he jindagi
 These faces are considered outsiders in a state that has outlawed itself by its own immorality
 yah 2012 kaa bharat tha jahaan jitna bada sarokaar, utani hi zyada asahmat bheed thi
 The speed with which his anger increased, could only be equaled by this system
 is aakrosh kaa beej jantar-mantar or aisi hi duusari jagahon par panpa tha, jab uske nishane par sirf bhrasht netaa hua karte the
 But this anger spread like cancer has not only indicated that the ruling class has become morally hollow but also that modernity is an illusion in this republic of robbers; Where the most sophisticated way of defending power is to adopt the real issue in the other direction
 hamane pehle bhi dekha tha ki sieji ke khulaase ke baad kis tarah lut ke aankadon par desh kaa sarkari tantra pehali pratikriya main shuturamurg kii tarah gardan dhansaae inkaar kii mudra main baitha rahaa tha
 A
 Notorious for spectrum scandal
 raja hon yaa kaamanwealth ghotaale kaa cheharaa suresh kalmari, yah rosemara kii baat nahin thi
 But what happened was that people got the impression that punishment in this country is never in proportion to crime
 nyaaypalika ho yaa sansad, naagarik samaaj kii sabhi sansthaaon ne kisi na kisi tarah se nagarikon ko niraash hi kiya he
 In a democracy looted by elected representatives, people now began to see themselves as the most degraded shareholder
 isi kii parinti rahi ki 2012 ke ant tak mohabhang apane charam par pahunch gaya or gussaye nagarikon ne sadakon ko jang ke maidan main tabdeel kar daalaa
 Angry against corruption, the citizen has still not become leaderless
 pichley saal is gusse ko sanbhaalane kaa kaam gandhi topi pahane ek satyagrahi ne kiya tha
 The way the government machinery was getting entangled in a swamp of lies and the last thread of credibility with the leaders was broken, it became a Gandhian ideal for the citizens who fought their battles on the road
 is saal anna hajaare ke anuyaayiyon ne jamini str par fail rahe asantosh ko pakadaa or apni ladaai ko nayaa charan diya-yah jang ab raajnneeti ke akhaade ke bheetar honi thi
 The force of anger sustained the anti-corruption movement, but it needed a director

 In this context, the anger that engulfed the entire Northeast after the blood of the tribals swept across Bodoland also became a political fodder for the leadership of the underprivileged
 isse jaateeyata kii raajnneeti kii bhayavahata main haalanki koi kami nahin ai or bahari tehra die gaye logon kaa palaayan kam se kam aadhunik bharat kii saanskrithik vividhta kaa to pratinidhi cheharaa nahin hi tha
 If you look at the past, you will find that angry citizens have always had a leadership, they have more or less carried a political agenda and they have also taken advantage of it
 rajya ke aarthik kuprabandhan ke chalate jab mahangaai aasmaan par pahunchi thi, to achaanak bahusankhya log bazaar se cat gaye the
 Even at that time, his anger was redeemed by political parties whose economic vision was far from being given a choice in a global world
 kah sakate hai ki 2012 dil todgaye vaala saal rahaa jab sirf netaa muskaraate rahe jabaki badahaal naagarik jindagi kii buniyadi jaruraton ke liye cheekhte-chillaate hi rah gaye
 When the scream of the public breaks the boundaries of fear, then it also disintegrates the well-being of powerful people and then it has the potential to frighten the terrorists
 haal hi main dilli main hue pradarshan teevr bhaavana or adarsh se sanchalit the, ise kisi kejariwal aadi kii vyaktigat eemaandaaree jaisi cheez chhu tak nahin gai thi
 It can be called the representative fight of the twenty-first century

 Some may say that Facebook or Twitter can bring revolution
 haalanki sawaal kisi madhyam kii sambhaavnaaon kaa utana nahin hota jitna sandesh kii takat kaa hota he jo asal fark daalata he, jaisaa hamane kahiraa ke taharir chowk par yaa baaki madhya-purv main dekha he
 Although India is a little different country, but it is not so much cursed that freedom is hostage to a handful of people
 yahaan daanv par sirf loktantr nahin he, balki chune hue pratinidhiyon ke madhyam se loktantr ke prabandhan par bhi sawaal he
 From prime time on TV to the front page of newspapers, the picture of angry Indian youth was a picture of a democratic India that was in denial
 madhyam chaahe soshal ho yaa paaramparik, gusse ko bhadakaata hi he
 It also clarifies the difference between sleepers and angry people
 2012 main gussaye nagarikon kaa naayakatv apraasangik netaaon kii niskriyata ke khilaaf khadaa tha
 There was not a single face in the South Block to relieve and reassure the protesters at India Gate whose words could be trusted
 kisi bhi pratirodh ke puraane pannon ko palaten to ek romaaniat si baar-baar dikhti he
 Tales of resistance are not always pleasant
 damankaaree rajya ke faujee boot use shant kara sakate hai
 His martyrdom is as inspiring as his victory
 haalanki virodh pradarshnon kii kabrgah par khadi kai sattayen sirf sawaalon kii takat se dhah chuki hai
 This romanticism of resistance on India's roads cannot change power
 haa, rajnatik sanskaar ko jarur badal sakati he
 This anger can illuminate the art of politics, darkness can reduce
 sadakon se uthakar samooche raashtra kii chetana ko apane kabje main le lene vaala acroshit hindustani guzarate dardanaak saal main hamaara nayak he, kyonki uske gusse ne raajnneeti ko jhakzor diya he, netaaon ko javabdeh banaaya he or in sabase kahin zyada, buniyadi taur par gadabad vyavastha kii foohadtaaon ko ujagar kiya he
 This angry Indian is the new leader of the freedom struggle
 narkotics control beuro (NCB) kii dilli unit ne amit naam ke ek aise shaks ko giraftaar kiya he jo baari maatra main pratibandhit dawaaiyon ko parcel ke jariye videshon main bhejtaa tha
 Especially in the US and England, its supply was more

 The industry was shocked when the news of Cyrus Mistry being removed as chairman of Tata Group came on Monday
 har kisi kii jubaan par yah sawaal tairne laga ki aakhir chaar saal ke bheetar hi mistre ko kyon hataa diya gaya jabaki company ne to unhen 30 saal ke liye chairman banaaya tha
 Tata Group did not give any official reason for the removal of its youngest chairman, Cyrus Mistry
 yahaan ham chaar sambhavit kaarnon kaa zikr kar rahe hai jinase tata group mistre ke kaam se khush nahin tha
 1
 shareholders se kharaab vyavahartata motors ke shairdharakone agast 2016 main shikaayat kii thi ki unhen prati share sirf 20 paise dividend diya gaya
 Mistry had then justified the move
 unhone kaha, aap sabhi se jutai puunji nae products main laga rahe hai
 There is no place for weak hearted people in this long journey
 2
 The group has a cross honorship among randomized group companies
 tata sans kii tata motors yaa tata steel main hissedari he or in companiyon kii ek-duusare main hissedari he
 This did not lead to identification as a diversified group
 vahiin,tata samooh kii karypranalimen naukarshahi kaa dabadabaa he
 3

 But they could only indicate this
 vistrut plan pesh nahin kar paae
 4
 faisle lene main dereemistre samooh ke vibhinn kaarobaar kii leadership main jaan phoonk nahin paae
 After the death of Carl Slim in 2014, there was a delay in appointing a CEO at Tata Motors
 haalanki, tisies ke liye en chandrashekharan jaisaa smart leader khojane main kaamyaab rahe
 5
 slolrnor, class atend karte rahemistre ne pehle teen saal tata samooh ke kaarobaari samrajya or isaki jatiltaaon ko samajhane main laga die
 He continued to increase his understanding on geo-political, technology and social issues
 class room or seminar main nai-nai policy hi sikhte rahe
 This will have an impact: The news of the removal of Cyrus Mistry from the post of Chairman of Tata Sons has led to a fall in the stock market
 mistre ke kaarykaal main tata group kii companiyon ke sheyaron kii keemat 515 fisadi tak badi he
 In such a situation, the market is disappointed, uncertainty can also arise
 tata group kii companiyon par mangalvaar ke kaarobaar main negative asar dikhaa he
 The shares of companies of the group, which are already seeing the impact of bad news, may get hit more
 bazaar kii chaal bhi thodi negative rah sakati he
 The news of the removal of Mistry is going to shock the market
 sirus chizon ko alag tarah se handle kar rahe the
 He was consolidating the group's business by selling the Tata group's non-core business
 unka dhyaan kam munaafe vaale kaarobaar se baahar nikalakar oonche munaafe vaale kaarobaar par kendrit karnaa tha
 The Tata group is good as a human being, but is a bit behind in keeping pace with the business cycle

 " dominica ke windsar park main west indies or australia ke bich khele ja rahe test ke duusare din australian ballebaaj adam vojes ne vah record bana diya, jo 138 saalon ke test itihaas main ab tak nahin ho paaya tha
 The Australian batsman made history in his very first Test
 35 saal or 243 din kii umr main unhone apane pehle test main shatak bana diya
 Now the record of making a century while making the debut has become the name of Adam Voges
 unhone zimbabwe ke ballebaaj dev houton ke record ko apane naam kiya he
 Zimbabwe's Dave Houghton scored 121 against India in 1992
 tab houton kii umr 35 saal or 118 din thi
 This was also the first test of Zimbabwe
 jaahir he, australia kii ore se bhi debyue karte hue sabase zyaada umr kaa record ab adam vojes ke naam ho gaya he
 He has broken the record of Marcus North
 north ne 2009 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf shatak banaaya tha, tab ve 29 saal kii umr main debyue kar rahe the
 During his unbeaten 130-run innings, Voges also held the record for the most runs scored at Windsor Park
 is maidan par shatak bananaa itnaa mushkil he ki ab tak keval paanch ballebaaz hi yahaan shatak bana paae hai
 The comments isse pehle maidan par sabase zyada 116 ran kii pari kaa record es chandrapal ke naam tha
 Although Vosges is the 20th batsman from Australia to score a century while making his debut, but only 6 of these batsmen have been able to do so on foreign lands
 darasal vojes ko ek dashak ke lambey intazaar ke baad dominica main test khilne kaa mauka mila
 Voges did not let this opportunity go by hand
 iske liye unhen josh hejalwood kaa abhaari hona hoga, kyonki dasven wicket ke taur par jab josh hejalwood ballebaazi ke liye utre tab vojes apane shatak se 23 ran dur the
 But Hazlewood played a 97-run partnership with Voges for the tenth wicket, playing the best innings of his Test career
 hejalwood ne 39 ran banaae or adam vojes ke itihaas banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He holds the record of Zimbabwean batsman Dave Houghton
 zimbabwe ke dev houton ne bharat ke khilaaf 1992 main 121 ran kii pari kheli thi
 Houghton was then 35 years old and 118 days old
 ye zimbabwe kaa bhi pehla test tha
 Apparently, Adam Voges has now become the oldest record ever made by Australia
 unhone marcus north ke record ko todaa he
 North scored a century against South Africa in 2009, when he was making his debut at the age of 29
 apni naabad 130 ran kii pari ke dauraan vojes ne windsar park main sabase zyada ran kii pari kaa record bhi bana diya
 It is so difficult to score a century on this ground that so far only five batsmen have scored centuries here
 tippaniyan Earlier, the record of the highest innings of 116 runs on the field was in the name of S
 Chandrapal
 vaise vojes australia ke 20wein ballebaaz hai, jinhone debyue karte hue shatak banaay he, lekin inamen se mahaj 6 ballebaaz videshi jameen par aisa kar paae hai
 Voges actually got a chance to play the Test in Dominica after a decade-long wait
 is maukey ko vojes ne haath se jane nahin diya
 For this, he has to be thankful to Josh Hazlewood, as Voges was 23 runs off his century when Josh Hazlewood came out to bat as the tenth wicket
 lekin hejalwood ne apane test kariyar kii behtareen pari khelte hue dasven wicket ke liye vojes ke saath 97 ran kii saajhedaari nibhaai
 Hazlewood scored 39 and played a key role in making Adam Voges' history

 Do you ask any classical dance artist what the meaning of their dance is
 
 
 nahin
 But be it theater or film, the audience wants to know why
 ' ye kahana he thiotre ke sthapit kalakaar bhupesh kumaar pandya kaa
 Bhupesh, who studies from the Indian School of Drama, has a long experience of plays and has also done more than a dozen Bollywood films
 inamen se 'hazaron khwahishen aisi,' 'viki donor' or 'gandhi tu hitler' jaisi behtareen filmein shaamil hai
 Apart from films and plays, Bhupesh has also worked in Shyam Benegal's popular serial 'samvidhan'

 What is art for you? Imagination and lies that contain more truth than truth
 jo logon ko sochane par majaboor kare or ek nishpaksh nirnay par pahunchane kii koshish kare
 What should be the responsibility of an artist? The responsibility of the artist should be solely and only towards art
 samaaj ke liye saamaajik kaaryakarta hai, netaa hai
 The art of the artist should be for everyone and not for anyone
 sab par ungali uthaani chahie or kisi par bhi nahin
 How close do political dramas get to art? The drama comes from society itself
 lekin kisi khaas party ke prachaar kaa madhyam bananaa kala kii shrenee main katai nahin aata he
 Artist ideology should be only art
 lekin aisa kahana ki art hi vichaardhaara honi chahie, art ko ek seemaa main baandhna nahin hua?bilkul nahin
 Art becomes limited when the 'bhompu' of a particular political party is lost or it starts working under an agenda
 kyonki tab uski seemaa nirdhaarit ho jaati he
 Can art be taught to anyone? Absolutely
 lekin uski ek seemaa he

 Theaters here are luxury

 There are countless such problems but the good thing is that plays are happening
 jahaan tak industry banane kii baat he to jab tak ye samasyaayein hal nahin hongi tab tak industry bana paanaa bahut mushkil he

 Protests have intensified in the Kashmir Valley, so infiltration efforts from Pakistan have also increased along the Line of Control, but this time the atmosphere has changed a bit
 modi sarkaar apni line spasht kar chuki he
 There will be no talk with separatists
 patharbaajon se sakhti se nipta jayega or ghuspaith main madadgaar pakistan sainya chaukiyon par sakhti se prahaar bhi jari rahegaa
 Meanwhile, in the midst of political rhetoric in Kashmir, on Wednesday, the Defense Minister made a clear announcement that the army has complete freedom to take decisions in a war-like area
 isse saaf dikhataa he ki kashmir par modi sarkaar kii niti pehle kii sarkaron se saaf alag he

 Simultaneously, it was announced that Pakistani help would continue to be demolished to prevent further infiltration
 pehali baar sena ne karrwai kaa video jari kiya
 This is a changing form of India's military diplomacy
 pehle elosi par karrwai ko lekar koi elaan nahin kiya jaataa tha, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Last year, by releasing a video of the surgical strike and now the demolition of Pakistani bunkers, India gave a clear message that Pakistan's indirect war policy on Kashmir issue will no longer work
 2
 In dealing with the stones, the army is taking action against the stone-pelting at the instigation of Pakistan in the freedom of action
 pakistan se patharbaajon ko mil rahe paise ko rokane ke liye tamaam agenciyaan ection le rahi hai
 Steps such as honoring Major Gogoi, who tied the stone-pellet on the jeep's bonnet, will send a strong message to the valley

 a clear message by not talking to the anti-national elements, with this, the government has made it clear that no organization working against the country will be negotiated
 kashmir ke algaavvaadi sanghathanon ke liye ye saaf sandesh he
 Earlier, on the matter of inviting separatist leaders to the Pakistani High Commissioner's dinner, the Modi government had given a clear protest and gave a message to Pakistan to stay away from interference in Kashmir
 5
 While India has been thwarting Pakistan's attempts to internationalize the Kashmir issue on the international stage, India has also become vocal in recent times about its strategy to expose its conspiracies to spread terror
 yahi kaaran he ki haal main america raashtrapati donald trump ne saudi arab daure ke dauraan navaj sharif kii maujuudagi main bharat ko aatankwaad se peedit desh bataaya or pakistan jaise aatankwaad ke madadgaar deshon ko sidhi chetavanee di

 What is different from Manmohan Government's policy? Congress has formed a working group headed by former PM Manmohan Singh to protest against the Kashmir policy of Modi government
 congress kaa aarope he ki modi sarkaar ke teen saal main kashmir main shanti ke liye manmohan sarkaar ke prayaas bhi bekaar ho gaye
 The Congress says that Manmohan Singh's government had tried to improve the situation in Kashmir by talking to different sections of society, but the Modi government has disconnected from the people

 Shiv Sena activists were shocked when Uddhav Thackeray told party workers that i apologize for the seats that the coalition has missed, where party workers have had to be satisfied
 mumbai main shivasena kii dashahra raily shivaji park main bulaai gai thi
 In this rally, Uddhav Thackeray was seen explaining to the party workers on the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) why the party decided to re-align with the BJP
 maharashtra main shivasena kii bhoomika bijepi ke liye hameshaa se bade bhai ke taur par rahi he lekin ab sameekaran badal gaye hai
 Shiv Sena is contesting 124 seats, while BJP is contesting 164 seats
 288 siton par hone vaale is gathbandhan main anya partiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 Uddhav Thackeray said, for the first time, that the Shiv Sena was forced to bow down, for the first time when Maharashtra got fewer seats in the alliance
 shivasena kisi ke saamne jhukati nahin he
 Compromise is a part of the alliance
 main vyaktigat taur par shivasena kaaryakartaaon se maafee maangata hum jin siton par hamaara vot share nahin he
 We have tied up for Maharashtra
 'uddhav thakare ne party kaaryakartaaon se raily ke dauraan poocha kya ki kya aap party ke faisle se sahamat hai, jiskaa party kaaryakartaaon ne haa main jawaab diya
 Uddhav Thackeray appealed to the party workers to work for the alliance

 Uddhav, addressing his traditional annual Dussehra rally, described Shah as a man who fulfilled his promises and said that abolishing Article 370 was a dream of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray
 thakare ne kaha, "amitbhai jo kehete hai, use karte hai
 With the abolition of Article 370, Balasaheb Thackeray's dream has been fulfilled
 ab ham samaan naagarik samhita chaahate hai
 "uddhab Thackeray, throughout his speech, seemed to emphasize only why he decided to form an alliance with the BJP
 uddhav thakare ne jor diya ki unki party ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye patibaddh he
 The Shiv Sena has been demanding legislation for the construction of the Ram temple
 shivasena pramukh haalanki is dauraan yah kehane se bachate najar aae ki maharaashtra sarkaar main ve mukhyamantri pad chaahate hai, yaa mukhyamantri jaisi takat
 Sanjay Raut's separate statement, although Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut has given a big statement about the candidature for the post of Chief Minister in Maharashtra
 unhone mangalvaar ko kaha kiagali dashahra raily main party pramukh uddhav thakare ke bagal main shivasena kaa mukhyamantri baitha hoga
 Addressing Shiv Sena's Dussehra rally in Mumbai, Sanjay Raut said that we are winning more than 100 seats in this time assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki notebandi ke khilaaf kisi kii bolne kii himmat nahin hui lekin uddhav thakare ne bolaa
 Thackeray also said that the economy had slowed down due to wrong policies
 srilanka ke khilaaf 12 agast se shuru hone vaali teen test maichon kii siries ke liye team india kaa sellection guuruuvaar ko sandip patil kii aguwai vaali rashtriya chayan samiti karegi jisamen focus tisare spinner par hoga
 Barring this aspect, the selectors will have no dilemma in choosing the team and the place of at least 13 players is already confirmed
 ballebaaji ke daaromadar inpar hogayah bhi dekhnaa hoga kitim 15 sadasyeey hogi yaa 16 sadasyeey
 Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, captain Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma and a team captain Cheteshwar Pujara are all set
 yuva ke el rahul saatven ballebaaj ho sakate hai jo beemaari ke kaaran bangladesh daure par nahin ja sake the
 Saha will be the first choice for the wicketkeeper, the much-anticipated Saha will be the first choice for wicket-keeping while the second wicket-keeper may include the 16th player who could be Naman Ojha or Sanju Samson
 team main teen tej gendbaaj umesh yadav, eshanth sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar honge
 If fast bowler Varun Aaron is fit, then his selection is also certain
 bhajji-aswin ke alaava teesraa spinner bhi!do of spinner aar aswin or harbhajan singh apni jagah barkaraar rakh sakate hai or dekhnaa yah hoga ki tisare spinner ke taur par akshar patel ko chunaa jaataa he yaa anbhavi leg spinner amit mishra ko
 Karn Sharma was fractured before the Zimbabwe series, making Mishra a contender for selection
 unhone ab tak 13 test main 43 wicket liye hai haalanki aakhri test unhone 2011 main england ke khilaaf khelnaa tha
 His absence in the India a squad indicated that he could be selected for the Sri Lanka tour
 jadeja kaa sellection mushkilkharaab form ke kaaran ravindra jadeja kaa chayan mushkil he
 On the other hand Akshar bowled economically in three odis and two T20 matches against Zimbabwe
 pragyan ojha ne 24 test main 113 wicket liye hai lekin sandigdh ection ke kaaran pratibandh ke baad apane ection main badlaav karke unhen abhi lay hasil karnaa he
 He has given his clarification through social media after a growing controversy over a statement by the Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh, who brought the remains of 38 Indians killed in the Iraqi city of Mosul, to a biscuit-sharing statement on the question of compensation to the families of the dead
 wike sinhakal kya bolesomvaar ko mritkon ko muaavja dene ko lekar unase sawaal kiya gaya, jiske jawaab mengeneral wike sinhane kaha tha, 'ye biscuit baantne vaala kaam nahin he, ye aadamiyon kii jindagi kaa sawaal he
 Got it? Where do i declare now? There is some box in the pocket
 ' vah yaheen nahin ruke, balki mritkon ke pariwaron ko naukari dene ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki ye footbal kaa khel nahin he
 Cleanliness from Facebook tried to clean up through its post on facebook on Tuesday evening
 iskaa link baad main twitor par bhi daalaa
 He started his cleaning post by targeting the media and opposition parties
 unhone likhaa ki samvedanheenata ke naare lag rahe hai
 If some of the 'surmas' of the media and political parties are to be believed, then the charges have also been proved
 pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 The public will use its discretion and truth will prevail
 wike sinhane apane vivaadit bayaan kii recordng kii maang karte hue aage likhaa, 'yah meraa jimmaa he ki apana paksh aapke saamne rakhun
 The statement that is causing so much outrage, is that interview available in full format? i did not get it haa, mere paas mere sahyogiyon dwaara kii gai press vaarta kii recording jarur he
 Will those who make allegations provide interviews? ' The expectation is that they will not become so generous, otherwise this dispute will end here
 khayr, main ab aapako avgat karaata hum ki us din kya hua tha
 Evidence of denunciation is most welcome
 unhone aage kaha ki mosul se shav avshesh bharat laane ke baad media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahaa tha, or yah bhi bataaya kimuavjeko lekar sarkaar sabhi karkon par vichaar-vimarsh karke hi faisla legi
 But some people did not find anything special in his statement
 baar-baar ek hi sawaal poocha ja rahaa tha
 VK Singh said that he was sorry that a sliced video was served to you without context
 dukh he ki logon ko itani swatantraaa bhi nahin mil paa rahi ki wo apane parijanon or swadeshwasiyon kii mrityu kaa shok manaa paaen kyonki kuch log apni dukaan kisi bhi keemat par chalaanaa chaahate hai
 The hunger for salable news and issues to surround the government is probably motivating this type of conduct
 unhone apratyaksh rup se congress par bhi waar kiya
 He alleged that the process of families was published in the newspaper by calling the dead in the news instead of the illegitimate agent
 unke bare main kya kaha jaae
 Center will give 10-10 lakhs to each family
 The families of 38 Indian laborers killed in the mosque have now decided to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh each
 khudpradhanmantri narendra modine yah elaan kiya

 He said there was no record of 40 Indians in Iraq

 Season 11 of Bigg Boss has reached its Finale Week and Vikas Gupta, one of the top five contestants, is a bit scared of the other two celebrity contestants Shilpa Shinde and Hina Khan
 jab se mal main hui live voting ke rigelt saamne aae hai tabhi se vikaas kaa confidence thodaa hill gaya he
 In a recent media session at home, when Vikas was asked how much of a potential contender he considers, Vikas said that i know that i am not a celebrity like these two actresses, so i do not have fan following here
 mujhe to lagata tha ki main sirf ek maheene hi tik paaungaa lekin contestant or audiyans ke saport se main top five tak pahunch gaya hum
 Bigg Boss 11: Vikas added to Shilpa's front, became a friend in the last week, Dushik Vikas further said that when he went to the mall for live voting and seeing what happened with Hina there, it seems that i have a chance 
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki mere game plan, stritji or smart khel ko dekhte hue main top tu main pahunch jaaoongaa, agar main vinar nahin bana to
 Bigg Boss: Shilpa's win at stake, will these contestants win the show! Arriving at the mall, i saw how much fan following of Shilpa Shinde was there
 jaisaa ki salmaan khan sar ne kaha tha ki sho ke aakhri wyk main pataa chal jayega koun kitne pani main he
 And their point seems to be true
 Bigg Boss: media ke saamne uthe aise sawaal, aansu roak nahin pain shilpabta den ki pichley wyk nominete contestant main vikaas gupta, shilpa scindia, hina khan or lav tyaagi live voting ke liye mal gaye the
 In this voting, Shilpa was at the top and Love had to be homeless
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir sattarudh gathbandhan ko ek naatakeey mode par laakar khadaa kar diya
 The controversy has taken a serious form in the case of investigation of Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav in the state
 jahaan ek taraf argedy ne saaf kar diya ki tejasvi yadav mantrimandal se istipha nahin denge vahiin nitish kumaar ke istife se ek baar phir puraa kaa puraa maamle rajbhavan pahunch chukaa he
 Meanwhile, now the governor has only three options: The Bihar National Assembly has 80 seats in the figure
 janata dal united ko 71 siten milin
 Congress has 27 seats
 bhartiya janata party ke paas 53 siten
 Hence, the magic figure for a majority of this assembly of 243 mlas is 122 seats
 pehla vikalp (nitish sarkaar):nitish kumaar ke istipha manjuur hone par rajya kii mantrimandal barkhaast ho jaaegi
 However, according to the constitution, the Governor can accept the resignation as well as order Nitish Kumar to run a caretaker government
 vahiin is dauraan rajyapal ko rajya main nai sarkaar banavaane ke liye sthiti kaa jayja lenaa hoga
 Since the RJD is the largest party in the state assembly, the JDU has the possibility of forming a new government in the state
 lihaaja ek baar phir rajyapal niteesha kumaar se nae gathbandhan saathiyon ke saath nai sarkaar banane ke prastaav par vichaar kar sakate hai
 Nitish Sarkar: If Nitish's 71 mlas get the support of 53 BJP mlas, then the figure will reach 124 and the JDU-BJP coalition government will be formed in the state
 is aankade ko majboot karne ke liye lokjanshkti party (2), rashtriya loksamata party (2) jaise chote dalon ko saath main lekar kiya ja saktaa he
 Second option (tejashwi Sarkar): The largest party being the RJD is the Natural Choice RJD to form the new government
 yadi argedy nai sarkaar banane kii pahal karti he to is sthiti main aashwast hone ke liye rajyapal argedy se vidhansabha main milane vaale samarthan kii list maang sakate hai
 In such a situation, for the RJD to take the initiative, it is necessary to give a list of 80 of its mlas as well as 27 Congress mlas to the Governor
 haalanki yah list jaadooi aankade se dur he lihaaja, argedy ko nai sarkaar kaa ghatan karne ke liye behad jaruri he ki unhen anya badi partiyon ke vidhayakon se bhi samarthan mili
 Since horse trading is a possibility in such a situation, the Governor will take his decision keeping this possibility in mind
 teesraa vikalp:kisi dal ko samarthan nahin mil paane kii sthiti main rajyapal vidhansabha ko bhang karne kaa faisla le sakate hai
 In such a situation, elections will be held once again in the state
 congress adhyaksharahul gandhi guuruuvaar ko party mukhyalay main press conference kar rafel deal main aniyamitata ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa istipha maanga
 He has said that PM Modi is corrupt
 unhen is maamle main apana naam aane par istipha dena chahie
 Rahul said that through this deal, PM Modi has put 30 thousand crores in Anil Ambani's pocket
 rahul ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki raksha mantrinirmala sitaramanis samay france kyon gai hai
 What is cooking in France at the moment that they had to go there
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki piem modi bhrashtachar ke maamle ko lekar satta main aae the or vahi ab in aaropon se jujh rahe hai
 He has been accused, he should speak on the matter
 unhone kaha ki agar piem is maamle par bol nahin paa rahe hai to vah istipha de den
 He said the Kirafel deal is clearly a case of corruption in the defense sector
 is bhrashtachar ko samajhane ke liye sari chijen saamne hai
 Gradually the faults of this deal are coming out
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki is maamle mencongresane jepisi banaakar jaanch kii maang kii thi
 But the BJP backed out of it
 unhone aage kaha ki piem modi ne desh ke kisaanon, yuvaaon or garibon ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he
 Rahul says that in this case the former President of France had earlier said that the Prime Minister of India had said that Anil Ambani ji should get the Rafale contract
 ab daso company ke senior agxcutive ne kaha he ki is saude main anil ambani kii company ko saajhedaar banane kii shart thi

 The reason for this is not clear why his tender was not passed
 iske liye shaayad tejraj bhrashtachar ko zimmedaar maanata tha or isi vajah se wo kai baar lokayukta karyaalay pehle bhi ja chukaa tha
 In such a situation, he was very disappointed and for this reason he attacked the Lokayukta with a fatal attack

 Wow! Former Union Minister of Congress Salman Khurshid, who has made his remarks after giving a statement on the Wing Commander Abhinandan, has given clarification
 unhone kaha ki meraa kahana he ki wing kamadar abhinandan ko hamaari sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan payalat banaaya gaya tha
 Attacking the government aggressively, he said that i have only spoken the truth
 main credit nahin le rahaa
 In fact, the Pakistani plane flew into Indian airspace after being hit by an air strike
 pakistan kii is harakat kaa vaayu sena ne makul jawaab dete hue pakistani plane ko khaded diya tha
 During this time, two Pakistani aircraft were shot down
 isi dogphite ke dauraan mig-21 uda rahe wing commander abhinandar kaa plane krash ho gaya
 Abhinandan came out of the plane in time and came down with the help of a parachute, but as the wind was strong, he went into the Pakistani outskirts
 pakistani sena ne unhen bandhak bana liya tha
 India spoke in clear and strong words from Pakistan for the release of the pilot
 antarashtriya dabaav ke baad or vienna sandhi ke anusaar pakistan ne bahadur payalat ko bharat se supurd kar diya
 (see: Abhinandan's love for Tanvi, marriage to childhood girlfriends) On 2 March, when the whole nation was celebrating the return of Kamadar, Salman Khurshid tweeted that congratulations Wing Kamadar, you from India Faced enemies
 khurshid ne khud ko credit dete hae ye bhi likhaa kii hamen garv he ki aap 2004 main upie sarkaar ke dauraan fiter plane ke payalat bane
 After this tweet by Khurshid, he got trolled in social media
 logon ne unhen nishaanaa banaate hue hajaaron twit kiye
 Earlier in the year 2018, Congress had made a similar tweet on the death of Sridevi
 jiske baad congress ko logon ke gusse kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 On social media, the Congress expressed grief over Sridevi's death, saying that she was conferred with the Padma Shri during the UPA government in 2013
 party ke is rukh par jamkar aalochana hui thi
 Who is taking credit-opposition Both are trying to take credit for it

 If you are going through such a situation, then take care of these things in the office
 - agar aapako offis main koi pasand aata he ye baat galati se bhi bos tak naa pahunchane den
 Because they will feel that you are not serious about work
 personal or profeshnal life main aise banaaen balance, milegi safalataa- peshewar logon ke 9 se 10 ghante offis main guzarate he
 In such a situation, attachment to a colleague is common
 vahiin agar aap apane rishte ko lekar gambhir he to koshish karen kisi ko is baat kii khabar naa lage
 - Office Do not talk to your partner more
 saath hi brakefast, lunch or tii brake main unke saath jane se bachein
 Do this work before starting a startup, you will get success - You do not necessarily have to support your partner at all times in the office
 yadi aap aisa baar-baar karte hai to anya sahakarmi aapke khilaaf ho jaaenge
 - Even if both of you are in love with each other

 Therefore, concentrate only on your work during office

 'aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki lohan nadia suleman dwaara taiyaar 'octomom' naam kii vayask film main kaam karengi, jise america film jagat main porn film kaa darja praapt he
 The reason for this is that Lohan, surrounded by many controversies, has to pay a hefty fee to lawyers these days to prove himself clean and he is ready to work in such films to overcome the lack of money
 kuch din pehle party kaa daaman chhodane ko taiyaar laalkrishna adwani ab kah rahe hai ki desh main 1952 se abtak kabhi bhi bijepi ke liye itnaa acha maahaul nahin rahaa he, jitna acha ab he
 Advani has asked party leaders to prepare for the election
 adwani ne congress ko aade haath lete hue kaha, ‘congress ne pichley teen saal ke dauraan bijepi ko agle loksabhaa chunaav main jeet dilaane ke liye jo koshish kii he, or kisi ne nahin kii hogi
 Advani said the political climate in the country was perfectly conducive to achieving the party's record-breaking results, as the Congress-led government's failure to overcome corruption and inflation remains a favorable situation for the main opposition party
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ne sunishchit kiya he ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main bhrashtachar, mahangaai, jan hitaishi shashan or eemaandaar prashasan mudde honge
 'when a party worker raised slogans in favor of Advani, he said,' Don't raise slogans about us
 isaki jarurat nahin
 Instead focus on hard work
 ' unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ke kharaab pradarshan ke chalate raajnneetik halaat bijepi ke paksh main hai
 But he lamented that party workers sometimes lack hard work
 adwani ne samay se pehle chunaav kaa purvanumaan karte hue kaha, ‘mausam kii sthiti or anya chizon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue chunaav ayog bhi samay purv chunaav karana chahega, chaahe sarkaar chaahati ho yaa nahin
 The government may also want early elections
 ’unhone kaha, ‘par chunaav jab bhi ho, aapako samay kii atakalein lagaae bagaiyr taiyaari shuru kerani hogi
 Advani praised the Sangh amid increasing tensions in relations with the RSS over Narendra Modi's elevation to the party and said his policy of not discriminating on caste grounds had helped him gain the support of Dalit voters 
 adwani ne kaha, ‘aresas ne kabhi bhi jati ko sweekaar nahin kiya or vah maanata he ki samaaj ke sabhi tabake baraabar hai
 'he said,' When Mahatma Gandhi visited the RSS branch (meeting) in Wardha, he was surprised to see people of different castes sitting together having food
 ’ adwani ne kaha ki hinduon ne apana dharm parivartan jaateey jyadatiyon ke chalate kiya
 He said, 'RSS is of the view that the factor of not discriminating between people on the basis of caste has played a huge role in the political development of our party
 ’ adwani ne kaha ki bhedbhaav nahin karne ke is rukh ne daliton ko bijepi ke kareeb laayaa he
 He quoted former BSP chief Kanshi Ram and reminded him once in a conversation with him many years ago that he (kanshi Ram) had said, "what cannot be achieved socially (by Dalits) is politically Can be achieved from adwani ne punjab main hui aresas shakha (baithak) kaa udhaaharan dete hue daawa kiya ki sikhon ko chhodkar samaaj ke sabhi tabake inamen shaamil hua karte the

 aditi singh ne kaha ki rajya sabha main pesh kiye anuchhed 370 ke prastaav kaa main samarthan karti hum
 This will ensure security in Jammu and Kashmir

 The discussion is hot that the Congress may play a Jat reservation to stop Narendra Modi
 modi pichhadi jati se hai or congress ko dar he ki aise main kahin bijepi modi kii is pahchaan ko bhi vot ke liye jor-shor se bhunaane main na jute jaae
 Therefore, there is talk of giving reservation to Jats
 lekin kya sachmuch jaaton ko aarakshan kaa tohfa milegaa? maamla chaahe musalamaanon kaa ho yaa gurjaron kaa, chunavi mausam main kiye gayi aarakshan ke vaayade aksar khokhale hi nikalate hai
 Earlier, during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Salman Khurshid claimed that even if the Election Commission hangs him, he will continue to provide reservation to Muslims
 chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baavjood bhi us samay ke kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne elaan kar diya ki musalamaanon ko obisi cote ke bheetar alag se 9 fisadi aarakshan dilaa kar rahenge
 On the objections of the Election Commission, the Law Minister went two steps ahead and said that even after hanging, i will speak
 do saal biit jane ke baad pichde musalamaanon ko aarakshan kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin he
 It is time for elections again, the process of elections in five states has started and Lok Sabha elections are also on the head
 is baar aarakshan kaa jhunjhuna jat votaron ko lubhaane ke liye bajaayaa ja rahaa he
 Jats have been demanding for a long time that the Central Government should include them in the list of backward castes
 rajasthan, uttar pradesh, haryana or punjab main jat voter bahut sari siton par nattejey palatney kii takat rakhte hai lekin jat netaa kah rahe hai ki ve khokhale vaayadon se pehle bhi kai baar dhokhaa kha chuke hai
 This time he will continue to teach Congress a lesson
 akhil bhartiya jat aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh yashpal malik ne kaha, ' is baar ham vaayade se nahin maanenge, 2009 or 2012 main ham dhokhaa kha chuke hai
 We were also promised reservation along with Muslims
 is baar notification jari nahin hua to congress ko haraayenge
 'the path to Jat reservation is not easy
 saal 2011 main neshnal kamishan for baikward classes (NCBC) ne jaaton ko aarakshan nahin dene kii sifarish kii thi
 2353 castes have already been included in the central government's OBC list
 yah baat bhi lagbhag pakki he ki sarkaar ne kadam badhaayaa nahin ki duusari jatiyaan adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayengi
 It is also a question that after the recent Muzaffarnagar riots, the government would like to annoy the Muslim vote bank by giving reservation to Jats

 Several other leaders, including BJP ministers Chandrakant Patil, Girish Mahajan, Subhash Deshmukh and the party's state unit chief Raosaheb Danve attended the meeting chaired by the Chief Minister at the residence of Cabinet Minister Vinod Tawde
 vahiin, maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh daanve ne kaha ki rajya kii sarkaar maratha samudaay ko aarakshan uplabdh karaane ke liye patibaddh he or isiilie usne is aashay kaa ek adhyadesh paarit kiya he
 He said that the court has stayed the implementation of this decision of the government

 maharashtra vidhansabha ke sutron ne bataaya ki bharat bhalke (congress), rahul aher (bijepi) or dattatreya bhaarane (rakanpa) ne vidhayak pad se istipha de diya he
