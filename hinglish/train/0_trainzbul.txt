 Petrol-diesel prices are steadily increasing
 congress samet kai anya vipakshi partiyaan iske liye modi sarkaar doshi tehra rahi he, lekin modi sarkaar antarrashtriya halaaton ko daam main badhotaree kaa mukhya kaaran bataa rahi he
 The entire opposition was on the streets on Monday against the increase in prices, protests took place in many parts of the country and violence took place in many places
 lekin sadak kii ladaai ke baad asli jangsoshal mediaper shuru hui
 What happened on social media? Actually, due to the increase in the price of petrol and diesel, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is facing opposition attack, tried to explain something to the public by tweeting on Monday
 lekin bijepi kaa ye daanv ulta pad gaya
 4 pm Monday from the official Twitter account of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 45 baje twit kar upie sarkaar or endie sarkaar main petrol-dijal ke daamon ke antar ko bataaya gaya
 BJP explained this difference through a graph, but the way the BJP explained it was stuck
 bijepi ko lagaataar soshal media par trol kiya jane laga or congress ne bhi isko turant lapka
 In a few minutes the Congress created a new graph and responded to the BJP and exposed its mistakes
 isi ke baad se hi soshal media par bijepi ke is graph kii kirakiri ho rahi he
 After all, what was the BJP trying to say? In fact, in the graph which led to the troll of the Bharatiya Janata Party, it could not reach the message that it had to convey to the public
 graph main dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah 16 may 2009 se lekar 16 may 2014 tak upie sarkaar ko dauraan, tab 5 saal main,petrolki keemton main 75
 There was an increase of 8 per cent
 keemat 40
 71 from Rs 62
 41 rupee tak pahunch gai
 But in the BJP rule from 16 May 2014 to 10 September 2018, the price increase was only 13%
 petrol kii keemat 71
 80 from 41 rupees
 73 rupee tak pahunchi
 Now if you look at the graph carefully, the difference that the Bharatiya Janata Party has shown is the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, but the BJP has shown this difference as a percentage
 bijepi ke graph ke mutabik, upie ke paanch saal main petrol ke daam 75 fisadi or endie ke chaar saal main sirf 13 fisadi bade
 The same happened with diesel
 bijepi ne deazal ke daamon ko samajhaate hue graph main dikhaaya kidijalake daam main bhi 2009 se 2014 tak upie sarkaar ke dauraan dijal ke daam main 83
 There was an increase of 7 percent
 keemat 30
 56 from Rs 86
 71 rupee tak pahunch gai
 But in the BJP regime from May 16, 2014 to September 10, 2018, the price increase was only 28 percent
 dijal kii keemat 56
 72 from Rs 71
 83 rupee pahunchi
 That is, according to the BJP, the price of diesel increased by 83% during the 5 years of UPA and by 28% under the NDA rule
 graph se kya gaya sandesh?itnaa to saaf he ki bijepi ye dikhaanaa chaah rahi thi ki unke kaarykaal main petrol-dijal ke daam badhane kii gati kaaphi kam he
 But the way the graph was shown, it was trolled
 graph main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah petrol ke daam 71 se 80 tak aa gaye hai, lekin graph main dikhaaya is tarah gaya he ki maano daam ghat rahe hai
 But prices have increased and the pace of price rise has come down
 bilkul aisa hi dijal vaale graph ke saath bhi hua
 How did Congress show the mirror? After the graph, the Congress took advantage of it as soon as BJP started trolling on social media
 congress ne kuch hi minuton baad bijepi ke hi us graph main kuch chizein jod kar twit kiya
 The Congress said in its tweet that while the upa's tenure was going on, the prices were increasing continuously at the international level
 congress ne samajhaayaa ki antarrashtriya str par adhik daam hone ke baavjood bharat main daam itane adhik nahin the, lekin jab aaj antarrashtriya str par daam kam hai to modi sarkaar ne desh main petrol-dijal ke daam badha rakhe hai

 ''*** The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee has not cut the repo rate on Wednesday and kept it at 6 percent without making any changes
 isse aam aadmi ko saste karj ke liye kuch or samay intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Whenever there is a meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI, many terms like repo rate, reverse repo rate are heard
 ham aapako arabiai ke teen aise turm kaa matlab bataa rahe hai, jo aksar sunne ko milte hai
 Along with this, you will know how you are affected by their decrease
 ye bhi padhein : RBI ne nahin ghatai byaaj daren, saste karj ke liye karnaa hoga abhi or intjarrepo ratejab bainkon ke paas fund kii kami ho jaati he, to ve kendriya bank (arabiai) se lone lete hai
 They are given this loan by the RBI at a fixed rate
 yahi rate repo rate kehalaata he
 The repo rate is always fixed by the RBI
 arabiai aisa kyon karata haijab desh main mahangaai kaa dabaav bana rahata he, to aise samay main is par niyantran paane ke liye repo rate ek ahm hathiyaar sabit hota he
 Such an increase in the repo rate helps in controlling inflation
 darasal jab bhi repo rate badhata he, to aise main bank arabiai se kam karj lete hai
 This reduces the money supply in the economy
 isse mahangaai par niyantran paane main madad milti he
 You have an impact on this
 Whenever the repo rate increases, it makes it expensive for banks to take funds from RBI
 is dabaav ko bank graahakon tak pahunchaate hai
 Because of this, the loan you get becomes expensive
 jab bhi yah rate kam hota he, to bainkon ko zyada karj dene kaa mauka miltaa he or ve aap se kam byaaj vasuulate hai
 Reverse Repo Retriever Repo rate is the rate at which the country's central bank takes loans from banks
 aasaan shabdon main kahen to jis tarah aap bank se lone lene par iske liye byaaj chukaate hai, usee tarah arabiai bhi bainkon se paise lene ke liye unhen protsaahan raashi (reverse repo rate) detaa he
 The higher the repo rate, the more the banks will get
 ye bhi padhein : dhokhadhadi se bachaayegaa RBI kaa nayaa abhiyaan, jald hoga shuruarabiai aisa kyon karata horthvyavastha main mani supplai ko niyantrit karne ke liye arabiai yah kadam uthaata he
 How will the reverse repo rate affect you, so banks can be strict in giving loans to the common man or they give less loans
 darasal reverse repo rate badhane se unhen aam aadmi ko die gaye lone par milane vaale byaaj se zyada phayda miltaa he, to ve lone dena kam kar dete hai
 Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) Cash Reserve Ratio is the ratio on which banks have to deposit some money with RBI
 aap par aise padataa he asarajab bhikaish rigerv reshiobadhata he, to bank kam lone dete hai
 In fact, with increasing CRR, they have to keep more money in reserve with RBI
 isse bank kam karj dete hai or vah lending rates badha dete hai
 At the same time, whenever CRR is cut, there is pressure on banks to give more loans

 ' rahul kehete hai ki in sabake baavjood khilaadi zimmedaari lene ko taiyaar hai, ye team ke liye sakaaratmak baat he
 According to him, the dismissal of Abhinav Mukund and Karun Nair was overshadowed by the team

 He was expected
 karun nair acha khel rahe the
 These batsmen could not walk
 ye meri or duusare ballebaazon kii zimmedaari he ki ham pari ko behatar karen
 The good thing is that we are ready to bear the responsibility
 ' wo maanate hai ki ballebaaz partnership banaaen or gendbaaz is pich kaa faaydaa uthaa saken to bengalooru test ab bhi bharat ke haathon se fislaa nahin he
 He said that he was playing fiercely
 lekin ye unki zimmedaari thi ki team ke liye zyaada se zyaada ran jod saken
 When one or two batsmen were left at the end, they started adding runs fast and had to lose their wicket before the century
 unhone pari main nathan leone kii gendbaazi kii bhi taareef kii
 He said, 'the new ball was coming right on the bat in the beginning
 lekin wicket main nami hone kii vajah se spinners ne khub faaydaa uthaaya
 When the ball was old, Nathan took advantage of the situation outside the off stump, taking a lot of wickets
 wo concystant rahe or unhen iskaa faaydaa mila

 sharif ne yah kahkar rashtriya yojana ghoshit karne kaa sankalp liya tha ki ‘samooche kshetra’ se aatankwaad kaa safaya kiya janaa chahie
 The source said that the matter was brought to the notice of the Prime Minister, who immediately ordered the custody of Lakhvi

 In the name of the name, a Janata Party is also in the Bharatiya Janata Party

 It is not that only you are smiling on this unity
 ab dekhiye sharad ji ko bujurg netaa kehete hue lalu ne bhi zaraa unke kandhe ko gudguda diya

 They all never considered each other as their leader, but in this affair, they sometimes considered the late Harkishan Singh Surjeet as the leader of the congress-bjp opposition and sometimes Prakash Karat as the leader, in the name of opposition of the BJP, Sonia Gandhi was considered their leader and only In the name of opposing Congress, Vajpayee sometimes considered Advani as his leader
 sabko netaa maan lene ke baad kya pataa in rajanetaaon ko yah dhyaan aayaa ho ki ham aapas main bhi ek duusare ko netaa maan sakate hai

 agar aisa he to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko garv karnaa chahie ki unki vajah se bhartiya raajnneeti kaa asambhav sambhav ho gaya he
 Along with Modi, Mulayam Singh Yadav should also be congratulated on this day as he has indeed become the leader of Lalu, Nitish, Sharad and Om Prakash Chautala

 If everything in politics is to be defined by victory and defeat, then after getting 3 seats in Delhi elections, can bjp's prospects in Bihar be considered to end? If everything is to be defined by strong organization and power, then how did Nitish Kumar in Bihar join his ardent Lalu Yadav and replace Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was close to BJP, and become the Chief Minister again
 naitikta ke paimaane par koun paak saaf he yah sirf naitikta se tay nahin hota
 Time and its importance also comes from it
 adarsh ab badnaam ho chukaa he
 If practicality is the principle for everyone, then why not talk on this scale
 isamen kya shaq ki pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj congress hi nahin tamaam tarah ke dalon ke liye chunauti hai
 Opponents, even the allies like the Akali Dal and Shiv Sena of the opposition Narendra Modi, would consider him a challenge
 aaj kii bhaajapa apane dam par badhane kaa saahas karne vaali aakraamak bhaajapa he
 Even then, it is running an alliance with 29 parties, when it has its own majority of 282
 bihar main bhi bhaajapa kaa lokjanshkti party or rashtriya lok samta party se gathbandhan he or upi main apana dal se
 Apart from this, like the Janata Parivar, the BJP family has also merged
 2011 main uma bharti kii bhartiya janashakti party kaa bijepi main vilay ho gaya
 In 2013, Kalyan Singh also merged his Janakranti Party with the BJP
 2013 main bhartiya janata party main chupake se ek janata party bhi ja mili thi
 Subramanian Swamy Party
 duniya kii sabase badi party banane vaali bijepi ke saamne 15 saansadon kii nai party rashtriya str par na to chunauti pesh kar paaegi or na bihar ke andar
 Not everyone can be Arvind Kejriwal and every election cannot be Delhi's election
 bihar main bijepi ko loksabhaa main ek karod paanch lakh se zyada vot mili the phir bhi uske 90 lakh sadsy hone ke daawey ke aadhaar par ek hisaab karte hai
 The scale makes up the number of votes polled in the 2010 assembly elections
 tab bijepi ko 48 lakh vot ke saath 91 siten mili thim
 Now if the membership has doubled even by vote then BJP will not need Ram Vilas Paswan, Upendra Kushwaha and Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 2010 main jediu or bijepi ko 1 karod 13 lakh vot ke dam par 206 siten mili thim
 If you add the votes of Lalu, Nitish and Congress, then this number is more than BJP JDU
 1 karod 44 lakh vot kaa hisaab nitish ke paksh main jaataa he
 Even if Paswan got 20 lakh votes in 2010 among the 90 lakh members of the BJP, Nitish still holds the weight
 bas ye bataane ke liye itani mehnat kii ki kaagaz par kabhi-kabhi raajnneeti mushkil bhi lagati he
 According to the Lok Sabha vote, the new party has the upper hand
 lalu yadav ne saaf-saaf kaha ki nai party kii niti bhaajapa ko khadedna he
 Many experts have seen the formation of the new party mainly in the context of Bihar elections
 kya mulaayam singh yadav bihar main nitish lalu ke kaam aa sakenge
 In Bihar, in the Nitish Kumar government, Lalu Yadav and the Congress are giving support from outside
 vaise hi lalu or nitish upi main mulaayam singh yadav ke koi kaam nahin aaenge
 So does this merger have any other meaning which is not being seen
 kya kisi ek ko milaaye rakhane ke liye paanch or ko jutaya gaya he
 Inspired by the BJP family, Janata Parivar, Congress leader Digvijay Singh has also started talking about the Congress family
 trinmul congress, neshlist congress party, wiesar congress, tamil manila congress kaa vilay ho jaae
 It is another matter that the Gandhi family is unable to meet in the Congress for 55 days, so how will the Congress family be found
 cycle, laalaten, chashma, tir, sar par dhan kii bali uthaae aurat
 All these will now have an election symbol
 lekin kya saat maheenaa pehle nitish kumaar nae chunaav chinh ke saath bihar ke chunaav main janaa chahenge
 Those who once thrived on the ground of anti-congress with the BJP and went on giving energy to the BJP, now they want to roam on the ground of anti-bjp

 He told the newspaper, 'there were political expectations in this matter
 agar ham amit shah ko chargeshit kar dete to upie sarkaar bahut khush hoti
 But we went to the evidence and found that there is no such evidence against Shah, so that he can be prosecuted
 ’iske ek din pehle hi sibiai ne chargeshit karke intelligence beuro ke purv vishesh nideshak rajinder kumaar or teen anya par ishrat jahaan ke farji encounter main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old student from Mumbai, and three others died in an encounter in Gujarat in 2004
 is maamle ko shuru se hi farji bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Asked why Amit Shah was not charged as some witnesses are saying, the CBI chief said that there is some doubt in this case but there is no evidence

 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne 20 november 2016 ko bataur congress pradesh adhyaksh ghoshnaa kii thi ki agar unki party soobe kii satta main aati he, to yuvaaon main 50 lakh 4G smartphone muft baante jaaenge, jiske saath ek saal ke liye free data or colling suvidha bhi dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 However, at that time, Amarinder Paratanj had said that he was on par with the country's richest man Mukesh Ambani
 hakeekat yah he ki captain ne jeeyo ke bharose yah vaada kiya tha
 Actually, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio has given free internet and calling facility to the users of the country for six months
 ab sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki kyshmarinder yuvaaon komuft smartphone baantne kaa vaada puraa kar paaenge yaa nahin
 Hindustan Times quoted Punjab government and Congress sources as saying that during the election, Captain Amarinder was only promising the youth of the state, which Ambani had already done
 reliance jeeyo ne punjab main congress kii sarkaar banane par 50 lakh smartphone muft yaa phir behad saste main baantne kii peshkash kii thi
 Before this, when Amarinder was the Chief Minister of Punjab, he has a close relationship with Ambani

 3 million youths have been registered, about 30 lakh youths have been registered under the "captain Smart Connect" scheme to distribute smartphones to Punjab youth
 iske tahat panjikaran ke liye 10-10 din ke liye yojana ko do baar kholaa gaya
 When Amarinder was asked whether the promise of distributing smartphones in exchange for votes is not like bribing voters? On this, the Congress leader had said that the youth will be able to connect to the digital world by smartphone
 haalanki ab dekhnaa yah he ki karj se jujh rahi punjab sarkaar ke liye muft smartphone baantnaa kahaan tak sambhav he? reliance ke sutron kaa kahana he ki company ke liye ek saal tak muft data dena koi badi baat nahin he
 Reliance already has 4 million subscribers in Punjab

 One such relationship is of a best friend and think what will happen if you like his brother
 agar aap bhi aisi hi kisi uljhan main fansi hai to samajhadaari se kaam len
 Being stuck between friends and love is better to find a way in between so that the friendship does not break and your heart does not break
 
 
 1
 If you like your best friend's brother, don't take the initiative yourself unless there is a positive response from the front
 2
 Before doing anything like this, definitely think about your friend, how he will feel as he might not like this thing
 3
 Many times it happens that the brother of the friend treats you like his own sister and he has only the prospect for you
 4
 If both of you like each other, then first of all, after seeing the right time, tell your best friend about it and be ready for its good and bad reaction
 5
 Never let love get heavy between your friends, and walk in harmony with your best friend and love

 Rajan Sijuar, 55, the head of the Sijuar Panda family in Gaya district of Bihar, surrounded by a crowd of pilgrims, is looking into his yellow cloth to find out which ancestor of the pilgrim had come to the Sijuar family earlier
 nae tirthayatri kaa vivaran uske khandaan ke saath jodate hue isi pothee main darj kiya jaataa he
 Rajan Sijuar has traditional rights over the Pindadanis of several districts of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Bengal besides Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha

 From these documents, a pilgrim also gets evidence of his ancient connection with the Sijuar family
 is khojbin ke bich ek sahaayak ne tippanee kii, ''shaayad ab in dastavejon ko digital rup main rakhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 On this, Sijuar raised his head and looked towards him, said nothing
 philhal ve itane adhik vyast hai ki unke paas kuch bhi sochane kaa samay nahin
 By the way, with the passage of time many pandas of Gaya have got their own website built
 kisi vyavsaayik gharaane kii cells ranneeti kii tarah hi kuch gayaval pandon ne anivaasee bharatiyon or gaya aane main asamarth ati-vyast logon ke liye pratikatmak pindadaan sevaaon ke vigyaapan bhi daal rakhe hai
 Some pandas have started computerizing the accounts of their ancestors
 par rajan kaa maananaa he ki paramparaagat lekha-jokha computer par rakhe gaye lekha-jokha se zyada vishwasaneey he
 The Hindus reach Gaya from all over the country to offer salvation to their ancestors on 17 days of Pitrupaksha every year
 apane yajmaanon ko mritak purvajon yaa parijanon ke liye puja-tarpan karne main madad karne vaale gayaval pandon ke liye yahi sabase zyada vyast din hote hai
 The Sijuar family is a family of the Gayawal Panda community
 in gayaval pandon ko hi yahaan aane vaale tirthayatriyon se pindadaan karwaane or unhen sufal dene kaa haq he
 It is believed that it is only when this happens that mritatma attains salvation
 hindu dharmik vishwaason ke anusaar, mrityu ke baad mritatmaayen pitrulok main rahati hai jo prithvi or swarg ke bich main hota he
 From here, he is released to heaven only when his successor surrenders him
 pindadaan ko gayaval pandon ke anumodan ke bina purna nahin mana jaataa
 For these 17 days, the 'mini India' surrounding the Vishnupad temple of Gaya creates an atmosphere in which people from different regions of the country, different economic conditions and different dialects speak
 is saal 12 sitambar se shuru hue pitrupaksh meley main pindadaan ke liye 10 lakh se zyada logon ke aane kii sambhaavna he
 Though Pinddan also occurs in Gaya, Haridwar, Badrinath, Kurukshetra and Allahabad, it is believed that Pindadan on the banks of the river Phalgu liberates the ancestors from the cycle of birth and death
 puranic aakhyaanon ke anusaar, bhagwaan ram ne apane pita dasharath kaa pindadaan isi sthaan par kiya tha
 There are 14 clan of Gayawal Pandas with about 1,000 people including women and children

 The lives of Gayawal Pandas have been like this for the past several decades
 gayaval panda samudaay main vivaah isi samudaay ke bheetar hota he taaki unki 'raktashuddhta' bani rahe
 But now this community is shrinking
 pehle yahaan iske 1,484 parivaar the jo ab sirf 125 rah gaye hai
 Despite this, the tradition of getting married within the community continues because it suits them commercially
 atmaaon kii mukti ke anushthan ke dhandhe main yahaan ke pande duusare brahmanon ke saath saajhedaari nahin karnaa chaahate
 This Panda community has been a strong opponent of marriage relations in other communities, but there have also been some rebels like Gopal Lal Mahato
 jivan ke aathven dashak main chal rahe gopal ne ab se kareeb chah dashak pehle samudaay se baahar shaadi kii thi
 His two daughters and two boys are also married outside the community
 unka bada betaa uttar pradesh sarkaar kii naukari main he, jabaki chota betaa vikaas gaya kii pramukh travel agency magadh travells chalaane main unki madad karata he
 Mahato has no objection to marrying within the Panda community as it helps to stay connected
 par ve kehete hai, ''phir bhi hamen isaki keemat deni padi he
 Although there has been no study in this regard, the confidence of the people is constantly increasing that our community has been continuously shrinking, because the 'gene pool' of our forefathers remained within a small circle
 ''gayaval pandon main mahato parivaar akelaa nahin he jisane apane saamaajik dhaanche se baahar nikalakar nae mulyon ko apanaaya he
 The famous pediatrician of Gaya, Dr

 The competition has kept him constantly alert about his work

 He said that the pilot's release was as per law and it was not a favor
 unhone kaha ki 1971 ke yuddh ke baad bharat ne bina shart 90,000 pakistani sainikon ko waapas bheja tha
 Pakistan was defeated in this war
 haalanki, bharat main kuch logon, kuch patrakaron or kuch vichaarkon ne hamaare payalat ko waapas bhejne par unhen (khan) ek rajaneta qaraar diya lekin yah keval kanoon ke kaaran hua or yah bharat par koi ehsaan nahin tha

 mantralay ne kaha tha ki pakistan ke epa-16 vimaanon or emram missile kaa prayog karne ke bhi sakshya he or vimaan tathaa missile ke tukade maukey se baraamad kiye gayi the
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said in a media briefing that the mig-21 Bison of the Indian Air Force, which was flown by Wing Commander Vardhaman, had dropped the F-16 fighter aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force and its witnesses as well as electronic evidence
 Huh
 is hawaii ladaai main bharat ne apana mig-21 vimaan ganvaa diya tha or uske payalat wing commander vardhman ko pakistan ne apane kabje main le liya tha
 Pakistan claimed that it had dropped two Indian aircraft and rejected the iaf's claim that the F-16 fighter plane was dropped during the air fight (dogfight)
 kumaar ne kaha, ‘‘hamane keval ek vimaan ko khoyaa he
 If, as Pakistan claims, they have video recordings of another Indian aircraft toppling, why have they not shown it to the international media even after more than a week? '' johra aapa
 i wanted to say grandma, but if i say my voice, everyone's voice gets included in my voice

 According to the Aam Aadmi Party, the report stated that until last year, the work of printing of notes in this Chinese company was very slow
 lekin is saal utpaadan main achaanak hi oochaal dekha ja rahaa he
 AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha says, "if the biggest reason behind the demonetisation was to move towards the cashless economy, then it is beyond comprehension, what is the need to change the size-type of ten rupee note
" was
 sawaal khadey hote hai ki, in noton kii nae sire karai jane vaali chapai par aane vaale kharch ke peeche, asli phayda kiskaa ho rahaa he
 We demand that the Prime Minister come out and openly deny or accept these news outsourcing the printing of notes
 'AAP ke pradhanmantri se 5 sawaal -1- agar ye khabaren sach hai to in soochnaaon ko aam janata se kyon chupaaya ja rahaa he? noton kii chapai ke liye ek videshi company ko kyon chunaa gaya? kya koi bhartiya upkram is noteghpai ke is kaam main sakasham nahin tha? yaa phir bharat sarkaar ne ye kadam, chaaina dwaara apane vaishvik dabadabe ko badhaane kii ranneeti ke dabaav main uthaaya?2- is mudde kaa ek or sandehaaspad pahalu ye he ki, china ke saath bhartiya karency note chhapavane kaa ye kathith qaraar, nakli / jaali noton ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai ko or kamazor karegaa
 This step taken by the Government of India is putting us in a situation where we are encouraging ourselves to become a more international destination for printing fake currency? 3- If there is any violation regarding the security of printing of notes So what is the solution that India has to deal with this situation? Especially when that incident happens outside the purview of the Indian law system? 4- In such a situation, we would also like to know from the Government of India that our currency is being printed abroad, since when it has been printed and in what quantity? Were such notes printed abroad also used during the note ban? 5- If the main reason behind the printing of Indian currency was outsourced to China was 'cost reduction', then why it was greater than the need to maintain the sovereignty of the country's currency Rajya Sabha MP of the Aam Aadmi Party ND Gupta said that in two years there was a huge reshuffle in the Indian currency, due to which there is no concrete reason

 bijepi kii kendriya chunaav samiti ne punjab or goa ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye party ummidavaaron ko antim rup dene ke liye buudhvaar raat baithak kii
 The first list was released on Thursday
 bijepi netaa je
 P
 nadda ne goa or punjab ke liye ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kii
 17 names were announced in the first list for Punjab and 29 for Goa
 aapako bataa den ki bhaajapa kii pehali list main punjab ke kisi bhi mantri ko jagah nahin di gai he
 The BJP has currently put all its current ministers on hold
 haalanki bijepi ne apni pehali list main paanch vidhayak shaamil hai
 Let us tell you that Punjab has an election on February 4 in a single phase
 bhaajapa punjab main 23 siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi or baaki 97 siton uske varisht sahyogi shiromani akali dal chunaav ladenge
 The state assembly has a total of 117 seats
 abhi bhaajapa ne 6 siten vichaaradhin rakhi hai
 At present there are 11 BJP mlas, of which Navjot Kaur, wife of Navjot Singh Siddoo was MLA from Amritsar East, she has left the party and joined Congress
 bijepi ne 17 ummidavaaron main se 5 vidhayakon par ek baar phir se bharosa jataate hue tikat diya he
 The party has sitting mlas in 5 of the remaining 6 seats
 in 5 vidhayakon main se punjab sarkaar main do mantri bhi hai jo 75 saal se upar ho chuke hai
 Bhagat Lal Chuni from Jalandhar and minister in Punjab government and MLA from Anandpur Sahib is not in the mood to give party ticket to Madan Mohan Mittal as the party will not give 75 plus leaders ticket after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isliye ye donon netaa apane parivaar ke logo ke liye tikat maang rahe hai
 These ministers remained behind: Ministers who were not given tickets in the first list by the BJP in Punjab - Chunni Lal Bhagat, Madan Mohan Mittal, Surjit Kumar Jayani and Anil Joshi
 iske alaava purv mantri or jalandhar central se vidhayak manoranjan kaaliya or fagawada ke vidhayak som prakaash ko bhi pehali list main jagah nahin mil saki
 These five mlas got tickets - Sujanpur - Dinesh Singh Bablu, Bhoa (safe) - Seema Kumari, Pathankot - Ashwani Sharma, Jalandhar North - K
 di
 Bhandari, Dasuya- Sukhjit Kaur Shahiqya is the reason? According to sources, the party is not even giving tickets to senior leader Jalandhar Central MLA Manoranjan Kalia and minister Anil Joshi, who is MLA from Amritsar

 The motive is clear that the women, who were often busy in domestic work or working as low profile in the party, are trying to get their leader in the eyes of the party high command and get an opportunity to contest elections

 The list of crimes committed by the Sangar brothers of Uttar Pradesh does not stop coming on the Unnao rape case
 apane liye nyaay kii guhaar laga rahe diaiji rank ke uttar pradesh cader ke ek ipies adhikari ram laal verma par senger bandhuon ne kabhi chaar goliyaan daagi thim, jo unke seene or pet main lagi thim
 The Sanger brothers in Uttar Pradesh not only lost important documents of the murderous attack on IPS officer Verma, but also postponed the hearing of the case for years
 saal 2004 main bataur police adheekshak verma ne jab unnav ke ek avaidh khanan sthal par dabish di thi, us dauraan kuldeep senger ke chote bhai atul senger or uske gurgey ne unhen goli maar di thi
 Kuldeep Sengar, an expelled MLA from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main accused in the Unnao rape case, had created such political pressure in those days that important case files were stolen from the police station
 yahi vajah he ki verma kii hatya kii koshish jaise sansanikhej maamle kii sunwaayee 15 saal baad bhi shuru nahin ho pai
 IPS officer Ram Lal Verma, who has been hospitalized for several surgeries and months, survived by accident
 samachar agency ieenes ke mutabik us hamale ko yaad karte hue verma ne kaha ki unhen unnav main ganga kinare mafia giroh se karwaae ja rahe avaidh ret khanan ke bare main soochna mili thi
 When he reached the mining site, Atul Sengar and his henchmen opened fire on the police
 verma ne kaha, mujhe chaar goliyaan maari gayi
 i was lucky that i was rushed to a hospital on time and survived
 us golibari main kuldeep senger, bhai atul or unke kai gurgey shaamil the
 According to him, four-time MLA Kuldeep Sengar used to influence the investigation and trial of the case due to his influence
 unhone kaha ki mukademe kii sthiti kaa pataa lagane ke liye mujhe artiai file kerani padi thi
 What happened to me despite being an IPS officer is disheartening
 verma ne kaha, us maamle kii sunwaayee abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 Verma's son Abhishek Verma was also selected as a 2016 batch IPS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre
 sheersh police parivaar se hone ke baavjood verma nyaay paane or apane mukademe kii sunwaayee ke liye apane bete ke saath milakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Ram Lal Verma's friend and a DIG posted in UP said, "the truth is that Sengar, being a powerful politician in Uttar Pradesh, has managed to stop the investigation in this case
" police record se pataa chalata he ki atul senger ke khilaaf unnav dushkarm peedita ke pita kii berahami se hatya sahit kai bhayanak aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 The situation is that the Lokayukta ordered to investigate the 125 crore mining scam against Sengar is also being pressed by the authorities

 The central government is now going to formulate a new policy for the appointment of private secretaries and osds of ministers, so that necessary secrecy can be exercised
 khabaron ke mutabik, aath mantriyon ke nijee sachivon kii niyukti kii samiksha kii ja rahi he
 Prior to this, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has imposed a ban on the appointment of private secretaries of three ministers
 piemo ne grih mantri rajnath singh ke alaava rajya mantri wike singh or kiran rigeju ke privet sachivon kii niyukti ko hari jhandi nahin di he
 According to media reports, the PMO has not agreed to make people in key positions in the UPA government a private secretary
 rajnath ne kyon chunaa khurshid ke PA ko?piemo ne alok singh ko rajnath singh kaa nijee sachiv rakhe jane par adnga laga diya he
 Alok was earlier the private secretary of Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid in the UPA government
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki piemo alok kii khaastaur par pichhali posting se khush nahin tha
 It is also believed that the PMO can take the same approach with all ministers whose personal secretaries have been private secretaries of ministers in the previous government
 piemo ne purvottar maamalon ke rajya mantri wike singh or grih rajya mantri kiren rijuju ke nijee sachivon kii niyukti par bhi roak laga di he
 According to sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided that private secretaries and OSD (officers on Special Duty) of ministers in the old government (UPA) will not be placed in the new government
 haalanki is bare main sarkaar kii taraf se koi likhit aadesh jari nahin hua he
 There are at least 7 to 8 ministers in the Modi government who have appointed such officers as their personal secretaries

 JDU has written a letter to the Director General of Police (DGP) of Jharkhand, fearing that a conspiracy may be hatched to flee RJD supremo and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad from jail
 jediune bihar vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh tejasvi prasad yadav kii ek kukhyat apradhi ke saath selfi ko is sajeesh ke peeche kii vajah bataaya he
 Party spokesperson and Bihar Legislative Council member Neeraj Kumar, in a letter to Jharkhand Director General of Police, alleged that Tejashwi, the son of RJD President Lalu Prasad, is constantly meeting criminals these days
 aise main ashanka he ki kahin vah aparaadhiyon kaa ek dal banaakar apane pita ko jail se faraar karwaane kii sajeesh na karen
 Lalu Yadavchara is serving a sentence in a jail in Jharkhand's capital Ranchi in several cases of scam
 niraj ne aarope lagaaya ki siwan main tejasvi sajayaftaa purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ke ghar gayi or uske baad ek aam sabha ko sambodhit kiya
 He alleged that Tejashwi, who arrived at Gopalganj in the course of his visit, took a selfie with Suresh Chaudhary, the infamous and accused of several serious cases, which has gone viral on the social site
 jediu netaa niraj ne aarope lagaaya ki yahi nahin jab tejasvi ji aamasabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the tab choudhary unke manch par virajman hokar manch kii shobhaa badha rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the intimate relationship of both can be understood
 unhone jharkhand ke police mahanideshak se anurodh kiya he ki is maamle ko sangyaan main lete hue aisi kathith sajeesh ko asafal karne ke liye yathochit karrwai karen
 Tejashwi Yadav is out on a 'save Constitution' tour in Bihar these days

 ' kairana loksabhaa upachunaav main areldi jahaan apni daavedaari thok rakhi he, jise congress kaa samarthan hasil he
 At the same time, the SP is not ready to leave this seat under any circumstances 
 aise main donon partiyon kii dosti main daraar padati dikh rahi he
 Kairana is becoming a sore throat for the alliance against the BJP in UP
 vipaksh agar ekajute hokar kairana ke chunavi samar main nahin utarataa to bijepi ko maat dena aasaan nahin hoga
 Samajwadi Party General Secretary and considered close to Akhilesh Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhary has announced that Samajwadi Party will field its candidates in Kairana and Nurpur elections
 sapa ke is elaan se areldi ke armaanon par gaharaa jhatka lag saktaa he
 In the Kairana by-election, Chaudhary Ajit Singh of RLD has been planning to make his son Jayant Chaudhary his candidate for a long time
 itnaa hi nahin pashchimi uttar pradesh ke congress netaa imran masood pehle hi areldi ko kairana main samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 Imran had said that if Jayant contests the election then he will not stake his claim but will support the RLD
 sapa kairana seat ko kisi bhi surat main chhodane ke mood main nahin he
 The SP claims that this seat belongs to him and Munawwar Hasan has been an MP from here
 itnaa hi nahin 2014 ke chunaav main sapa number do par bhi rahi he
 In such a situation, she cannot leave her traditional seat for RLD under any circumstances
 haalanki sapa sirf ek baar is seat par jeet darj kii he, jabaki areldi ne do baar jeeta he
 Kairana's ethnic equation is the 17 lakh voters in the Kairana Lok Sabha seat
 is seat ke jaateey sameekaran ke dekhen to sabase zyada muslim matadaata hai
 Five lakh Muslims, four lakh backwards (comprising Jat, Gurjars, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati and others) and one and a half lakh votes are Jatav Dalits and close to 1 lakh non-jatav Dalit voters
 kairana seat gurjar or jat bahul maani jaati he
 There are three lakh Gurjar voters here, including both Hindu and Muslim Gurjars
 iske alaava 2 lakh ke kareeb jat he
 With this in view, RLD feels that if Jayant Chaudhary contests this seat as an alliance, his victory will be easy, but the SP is not ready to leave it under any circumstances
 haalanki mayawati upachunaav main pehle hi kisi ko bhi samarthan naa dene kaa elaan kar chuki hai lekin rajyasabha chunaav main areldi ke vidhayak ke cross voting ke baad vah ajit singh ko bhi apane tevar dikhaa chuki hai
 As a result, Ajit Singh expelled his MLA from the party
 kairana upachunaav main philhal samaajawaadee party or areldi ke bich sulah hoti nahin dikh rahi lekin aakhri faisla akhilesh yadav ko karnaa he
 In such a situation, it remains to be seen whether Akhilesh or Atij Singh make a big sacrifice to save the alliance that is being built to stop Modi
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kairana sansadeey seat se bijepi ke hukum singh ne jeet darj kii thi
 The by-election is being held due to his death on 3 February this year
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi is seat se hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh ko chunaav maidan main utaar sakati he
 Mriganka can get a sympathy vote due to the death of his father, equating to the assembly elections, five Lok Sabha seats fall under the Karana Lok Sabha seat
 is loksabhaa seat main shamali jile kii thanabhavan, kairana or shamali vidhansabha siton ke alaava saharanpur jile ke gangoh va nakud vidhansabha siten aati hai
 At present, four of these five assembly seats are with BJP and SP of Kairana Assembly seat
 in siton par bijepi ko 2017 main 4 lakh 33 hajaar vot mili the
 While BSP candidates got 2 lakh 8 thousand and 3 SP candidates got 1 lakh 6 thousand votes
 sapa ne shamali va nakud siten congress ko de di thi
 Kairana Lok Sabha seat, a political history of the Kairana Lok Sabha, came into existence in 1962
 tab se lekar ab tak 14 baar chunaav ho chuke hai
 In these, Congress and BJP have been able to win elections twice
 ye seat alag-alag raajnneetik dalon ke khate main jaati rahi he
 Yashpal Singh won the Kairana Lok Sabha seat for the first time as an independent candidate
 1967 main socialist party, 1971 main congress, 1977 main janata party, 1980 main janata party (secular), 1984 main congress, 1989, 1991 main congress, 1996 main sapa, 1998 main bijepi, 1999 or 2004 main rashtriya lokdal, 2009 main basapa or 2014 main bijepi ne jeet darj kar chuki he
 Muslim politics in Kairana Despite Muslim population in Kairana, Muslim mps have been elected only four times in 14 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke hukum singh ke khilaaf do muslim ummidavaar the
 The SP fielded Nahid Hasan and the BSP fielded Kanwar Hasan
 2013 main mujffarnagar dange ke chalate voton kaa dhruvikaran hua or do muslim pratyaashee ke hone se muslim vot bantane kaa phayda hukum singh ko mila

 For fans of Sachin Tendulkar, who are playing their 199th Test match in Kolkata, these five days are going to be a boon
 is test match ke baad vah mumbai main apane kariyar kaa aakhri test khelenge
 There is thrill in the atmosphere, there is excitement and there is a seriousness because after this people will never see this world's greatest cricketer playing in the field
 sachin un chuninda khilaadiyon main hai jinhen duniya sadiyon tak bhuulaa nahin paaegi or jo khel ke us mukaam par pahunche jahaan virale hi koi pahunch paata he
 The numbers and statistics of records only prove that he has been a great player but this cannot be a means to convey the feelings of crores of people
 duniya ke karodon logon ke dilon main unke liye jo jagah he use bataane kaa koi jariya nahin ho saktaa he
 Sachin has enthralled crores of Indians, not only cricket lovers from all over the world, with his brilliant game, he has cheered and entertained them
 unke khel main aisa jaadu rahaa he ki yakeen nahin hota ki koi insaan aisa khel dikhaa saktaa he
 He has an innate talent that elevates him and elevates him to the status of God
 unka khel kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin rahaa he
 And therefore there is no hesitation in giving him the status of Lord of Cricket
 sachin ne apane vakt ke bade-bade gendbaajon kaa jabardast muqabla kiya or jab vah rau main hote the to ve gendbaaj bahut maamuli dikhne lagate the
 It seemed that novice bowlers were throwing balls in front of a ready batsman

 Now Sachin is down the ladder of age and his decision to leave cricket is right

 Three states of the Hindi belt, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are to have assembly elections in December and the signs emerging from there about a fortnight ago looked completely anti-incumbency

 But as the elections are getting closer and the election campaigns of the parties have increased, the electoral mood seems to be turning
 pehle ke surveykshanon main jahaan bhaajapa ke khilaaf spasht ekatarfa sattavirohi lahar dikh rahi thi, to is surveykshan main tasviir kuch badalati dikhaai detii he
 Except for Rajasthan, where the public still retains the old stance of ousting the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government, the India today-axis Political Stock Exchange (PSE) September survey led by Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh For the BJP government, the situation seems to be of little benefit compared to earlier surveys
 haalanki madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii lokapriyata reating bahut oonchi he par bhaajapa ke liye madhya pradesh kaa muqabla kaante kaa rahegaa
 Since this survey was done before the announcement of Mayawati (BSP) -ajit Jogi (JCC) alliance in Chhattisgarh and now the contest in the state will be triangular
 isliye vahaan kii bhavishyavaanee karnaa tedha kaam he
 The optimism of the Congress in the state was based on the assumption that despite the initial hurdles, it would be aligned with the BSP
 garden city main rajnatik naatak ke thik baad basapa adhyaksh mayawati or purv congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich jis kadar mail-milaap or atmiyata dikh rahi thi use dekhakar kisne sochaa hoga ki donon kii raahen alag-alag bhi ho sakati hai?chhattisgarh main congress kii ummiido ko gaharaa dhakka laga he
 At a joint press conference in Lucknow on September 20, Mayawati announced a pre-election alliance with the Jogi-led Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC)
 jogi is gathbandhan ke mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa honge
 With 13 per cent Scheduled Caste and 31 per cent tribal votes, the BSP-JCC alliance is a coalition in the state that is capable of reversal
 paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki trikoniya mukaable main gathbandhan hi tay karegaa ki chhattisgarh kii kursi par koun baithegaa
 However, Pradeep Gupta, surveyor of the Axis and a long-time state visiter for the survey, says, "the Raman Singh-led BJP will benefit the most because it has the largest voter class among the obcs and tribes that along with the JCC not connected
 ''isamen nuksaan kise hona he isko lekar kisi ko koi bhram nahin

 In another major blow to the Congress, Mayawati has announced her 22 candidates in Madhya Pradesh as well
 congress ab bhi nahin cheti or usne chunaav-purv gathbandhanon ko antim rup nahin diya or agar basapa ne madhya pradesh kii sabhi 230 siton ke liye ummidavaar utaar die to madhya pradesh main congress ke mansoobon par pani phir saktaa he
 Some observers say a similar picture may emerge in Rajasthan, where 17
 2 fisadi dalit vot hai
 Let us see why and how this happened
 kya matadaata maujuuda sarkaar ke pradarshan se santusht hai? madhya pradesh main 41 pratishat matadaata santusht hai, vahiin 40 pratishat itane asantusht hai ki ve is sarkaar ko badalanaa hi chaahate hai
 The resentment of the voters towards the government is not as much for the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh
 lokapriyata main ve congress ke netaaon se kahin aage hai
 It seems contradictory that Chauhan's 46 percent popularity as compared to Congress' Jyotiraditya Scindia (32 percent) and Kamal Nath (8 percent)
 madhya pradesh main satta virodh zyaadaatar vidhayakon ke kaamkaaj ke prati asantosh se upja he
 The public believes that mlas are not interested in the development work of their region and they have promoted corruption on a large scale
 party ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, "vidhayakon ke prati jabardast asantosh he isliye party adhyaksh amit shah ne jabalpur ke paas bhedaghat main rajya chunaav prabandhan samiti kii baithak ke dauraan sanket de diya ki 165 party vidhayakon main se kam se kam 100 ke tikat cat sakate hai
 "these leaders were present in this meeting
 madhya pradesh kii janata bhaajapa sarkaar se khush nahin he phir bhi congress ke netaa lokapriyata main chouhan kaa muqabla kyon nahin kar paa rahe? kuch varisht congress netaaon ne sweekaar kiya ki chunaav abhiyaan prakriya ko suvyavasthit karne ke saare prayaason ke baavjood shshparty main sabhi staron par aantarik gutbaji he jo party ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he

 The PSE survey shows a huge resentment of the people towards the Raje government and 48 percent people are in a mood to change the state
 mukhyamantri kii lokapriyata reating 35 fisadi par he, jo congress ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke baraabar he
 Sachin Pilot is the third most popular candidate for Chief Minister with 11 percent popularity
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki yahaan bhi, "party ke bheetar gutbaji'' raaje kii lokapriyata ghatane kaa mukhya kaaran he
 Manvendra Singh, the son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh and MLA from Barmer Shiva Assembly constituency, recently said goodbye to the BJP reflects this factionalism and tussle
 chhattisgarh main, mukhyamantri raman singh kii lokapriyata 41 pratishat darj kii gai
 Raman Singh's personal popularity was 2 percent higher than the voters' satisfaction with the government
 yani 29 pratishat log sarkaar ke saath hai to 35 pratishat ise badalanaa chaahate hai
 Another 11 percent consider the government's performance as "average" while 16 percent have no opinion about it
 yani ye matadaata jinka rukh abhi tay nahin he, chunaav kii disha tay kar sakate hai
 Unemployment (47 percent), agriculture (45 percent), lack of drinking water (42 percent), problems related to drainage and sanitation (40 percent) and price rise (31 percent) are the biggest issues among voters in Madhya Pradesh
 empi kii tarah anya do rajyon main bhi yahi mukchay mudde hai
 Ironically, Madhya Pradesh has the highest agricultural growth rate among all states, despite this, the state has been facing peasant movements since June 2017
 rajasthan main svachh bharat abhiyaan ke bade daavon ke baavjood, rajya ke 56 fisadi matadaataaon kii samasyaayein jal nikasi or swatchta se judi hai
 Raje has carried out a cleanliness drive with a broom and a shovel in his hand, but the latest prediction of the PSE survey is also not good news for him
 surveykshan se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki matadaata krishi (47 pratishat), berogari (43 pratishat) or mulya vruddhi (42 pratishat) jaise mudde zyada ahm maanate hai bajaae pahchaan ke mudde yaa phir mandir yaa rashtrawaad virdohi vishay ke
 The same happened in Chhattisgarh
 berogari (41 pratishat), krishi (40 pratishat) or mulya vruddhi (38 pratishat) ke saath yahaan safai sabase bada mudda (52 pratishat) he
 Can the picture change as the election draws closer? Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal says, "yes, definitely
