 beete kuch samay se lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete tejprapaat jis tarah se raajnneetik bayaanbaji kar rahe hai, usase rajd kii pareshaaniyaan or badhane lagi hai
 Due to Amada Tej Pratap to increase political activism, there have been reports of split in RJD many times
 darasal, rashtriya janata dal ke netaaon kii pareshaani he ki jab se unki party ke supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete tej pratap yadav ne patna main apni raajnneetik sakriyata badhaayi he, tab se aise kai maukey aae hai jab party kii kirakiri or faziihat hui he
 However, it is another matter that Tej Pratap is collecting headlines in the media every day from his statements
 ek baar phir se nae saal main raajnneetik bayaanbaji se tejpratap ne rajd netaaon kii mushkilen badha di he
 In fact, on Thursday, Tej Pratap Yadav made a statement about his party's senior MLA and main spokesperson, Bhai Virendra, for which many political matters are being extracted
 tejpratap yadav ne bhai birendra kii patliputra sansadeey kshetra se ummidavaari ko lekar kaha ki unki kya aukatahai or patliputra sansadeey kshetra se unki badi bahan misa bharti chunaav ladengi
 In fact, a few days ago, Bhai Virendra, MLA from Maner assembly seat under Pataliputra parliamentary constituency, had expressed his wish that if the party wants, he can become a candidate from Pataliputra parliamentary constituency, but did not like Tej Pratap and asked about this
 On leaving, he said clearly that as far as the candidate is concerned, she will be Misa Didi
 tej pratap ne iske baad manir vidhansabha ke antargat logon se mulaaqaat bhi kii
 Asked about the recent statement made by Manera MLA and RJD chief spokesperson Bhai Virendra in which he expressed his desire to contest from Pataliputra, Yadav said, "the people of Pataliputra want Misa Didi
 matadaata lalu prasad ke naam par vot daalate hai
 Neither Brother Virendra nor i can do anything in it
 'is bich tej pratap ke bayaan par bhai virendra ne ek baar phir kaha ki unke netaa lalu prasad hai or kisi or ke bayaan par vah sangyaan nahin lete
 On the other hand, when Lalu Yadav's political successor and Leader of Opposition, Tejashwi Yadav was asked in this regard, he said that who says what he does not mean anything to him
 up patliputra kaa pratyaashee ho yaa kisi or sansadeey kshetra kaa ye to party supremeo lalu ji hi tay karenge
 It is clear from Tejashwi's statement that he does not agree with Tej Pratap's statement and also wants to keep senior party mlas like Bhai Virendra with him
 party ke anya varisht netaaon kaa kahana he ki tej pratap har din ul-julul bayaan dekar media kii surkhiyon main rahanaa chaahate hai or vah rajd ke satta centre main aana chaahate hai
 But no one takes him seriously in the party
 bataa den ki parisemen ke baad 2008 main bani patliputra loksabhaa seat ko rajd ke 'pratham parivaar' ke liye pratishtha ke rup main dekha jaataa he, kyonki lalu prasad or unki beti donon ne yahaan se chunaav ladaa or donon ko safalataa nahin mili

 norge main bachche se badasluki ke maamle main giraftaar bhartiya dampati par court mangalvaar ko apana faisla sunayegi
 Andhra Pradesh software expert Chandrashekhar Vallabhnai and his wife Anupama were sent into custody on November 28 on a criminal charge of misbehaving with their son
 isse purv bharat ne norge maamle main intjaar karne kaa rukh akhriyaar karte hue kaha ki kathith bal pratadna ke maamle main norge duutavas ko jo kuch uchit lagegaa, vah karegaa
 However, it made it clear that the incident is linked to a private citizen and local law
 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha, ‘yah ek aisa mudda he jo sarkaar se judaa hua nahin he
 It is a matter related to a private citizen and the law of that country
 tippaniyan At the same time, according to the news from Hyderabad, the couple's family said that the allegations against Vallabhnei and Anupama in Norway are false
 gauratlab he ki dampati par aarope lagaaya gaya he ki saat varshiya unke bete ne jab skool bas main apni pant geeli kar lee or apane pita ko is bare main bataaya, tab uske pita ne dhamkee di ki yadi usne dobaaraa aisa kiya to use bharat bhej diya jayega
 Earlier, India took the stand to wait in Norway and said that the Norwegian Embassy will do whatever it deems appropriate in the case of alleged child molestation
 haalanki, yah spasht kar diya ki ghatana ek privet naagarik or sthaneey kanoon se judi hui he
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said, 'this is an issue which is not connected with the government
 yah ek privet naagarik or us desh ke kanoon se judaa maamla he
 The comments vahiin hyderabad se mili khabar ke mutabik, is dampati ke parivaar ne kaha ki norge main vallabhnei or anupama par lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe hai
 The couple is alleged to have alleged that when their seven-year-old son wet his pants in the school bus and told his father about it, his father threatened to send him to India if he did it again Will go

 ham 21veen sadi main bhale hi khud ko duniya kaa sabase pragatisheel desh hone kaa daawa kar rahe hon
 Talking about sending a vehicle to Mars, but the conditions at the ground level are still very frightening
 dalit samaaj se taalluk rakhane vaale logon ko aaj bhi jaanwaron se badtar mana jaataa he
 Despite all this, the youth coming out of this society are writing new stories of success
 koi upiessi top kar rahaa he to koi aaj 20 se adhik companiyon kaa maalik he
 Yes, here we are telling you about Madhusudan Rao, born in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, whose struggles and stories of inspiration are inspiration for people today
 pita the bandhua majdoor, ve hai companiyon ke maalik
 
 
 Madhusudan's father once used to do bonded labor
 iske evaj main unhen jameendaar se sirf bhojan mila karata tha
 Many times one had to sleep hungry even in the condition of not going to work
 ve bataate hai kidalit samaajase taalluk rakhane kii vajah se unki parchaai ko bhi apshakun mana jaataa tha
 He persevered even in these dreadful conditions and continued his studies
 kisi-kisi tarah 12veen paas kii or naukari paane kii chaah main polytechnic kar liya
 After Polytechnic, i did not get a job, had to work as a laborer
 
 
 unke polytechnic karne ke peeche to yahi manshaa thi ki unhen jald se jald naukari mil jaae, lekin afsos ki unase har jagah riference maanga jaataa tha
 They were kept away from job, citing the education of their household members
 aakhir main ve hataash-niraash ho kar bhai ke saath mazdooree karne lage
 Apart from this, they also used to do chowkidari so that they could run the expenses of the family by working overtime
 shame ke maare nahin jate the gaanv, ab puraa gaanv unka naam letaa he
 
 
 This is the basic difference between village and city
 gaanv main paley-bade log hameshaa gaanv waapas lautnaa chaahate hai
 Sometimes they may be two to four from the initial doctors, but they definitely want to return
 madhusudan bhi kuch aise hi mizaaj kii shakhsiyat hai
 He constantly struggled to succeed and in this sequence, he was also a victim of deception several times
 ek baar to ve bilkul se hi khaali ho gaye
 Those with whom he had opened the company, he was shocked with all the benefits
 unhone nahin maani haar, aaj parivaar ke saath chalaate hai 20 companiyaan
 
 
 Because of working with different people, he understood that only a few people should be trusted
 ve din bhar main 18 ghante tak kaam karte hai or unki patni hameshaaparachhaaiki tarah saath rahati hai
 He is the founder of MMR Groups today and covers more than 20 companies
 ve apane mata-pita ko apana adarsh maanate hai or har duvidha kii ghadi main unhen hi yaad karte hai
 Today, he is working to give employment to thousands of youth and Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi is also admired for his talent and passion
 congress kii parampara main rache based diggaj netaa or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee aaj shaam rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke ek kaarykram main hissaa lenge
 For this, they have reached Nagpur
 pranab mukherjee ke is kadam par siyaasi halchal tej he
 All Congress leaders are speaking out against this visit
 yahaan tak ki pranab mukherjee kii beti sharmishtha mukherjee ne bhi apane pita ko sakht naseehat de daali he
 What is Sangh? First thing of Sangh
 gulaami kii andheri raaton main hi sahi, lekin 1925 main vijayadashami ke din ek aisa sanghathan taiyaar hua, jisane raajnneeti se duuri banane kaa daawa kiya
 But it is also true that today all the major avenues of the country's politics pass through the streets of its branches and end at its headquarters
 wo sanghathan he rashtriya swayamsevak sangh
 Why there is a ruckus about the promise of Hinduism
 sangh kaa daawa hindu raashtra kaa he
 The intention of the Sangh is for a united India
 sangh kii soch saanskrithik rashtrawaad ke pannon main bhatakati he, lekin isi sangh ko lekar dharmanirpekshata ke himytiyon kaa ek tabaka naak bhun bhi sikodta he
 That is why when the Congress grew up in the tradition, former President Pranab Mukherjee, who learned politics in the shadow of the values and beliefs of nehru-indira and weaving Indian society in the fabric of secularism, accepted the invitation to be the chief guest at a Sangh program
 If done, there was an uproar
 aaj shaam nagpur par sabaki najarennagpur ke reshambagh maidan main hone vaala rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa tritiy varsh shiksha varg samaapan samaaroh khaas he
 Not only is former President Pranab Mukherjee attending it, he is becoming the chief guest but he will also participate in the passing out program of the RSS and give his views
 aaj shaam ko sabaki nazren nagpur par tikin hongi
 The Sangh has made full preparations on its behalf
 virodh or samarthan ke bich ye to tay he ki pranab mukherjee sangh ke kaarykram main jaaenge or tabhi ye tabhi pataa chalegaa ki dada ke dil main he kya
 Questions are arising that whether Pranab Mukherjee will give his views on nationalism? If we keep it, will it be the nationalism of the Sangh or of Nehru, whose politics, Pranab Mukherjee himself remains the same? Will his views match the views of RSS nationalism? Can they also put their objections to the question of Hindu Rashtra? Will Pranab Mukherjee remind us of the tradition of Sarva Dharma Sambhav that has come out of Gandhi's political thought or will he present opinions similar to those of the Sangh? Will he promote India's plurality and diversity culture, which is the true identity of India? After becoming President, Pranab's new face is believed to be that Pranab Mukherjee may be in the color of Congress all his life, but to become President Later, a new face was revealed
 samvidhan ke mulyon se puri tarah bandhaa hua
 As President, Pranab Mukherjee met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat several times in the Rashtrapati Bhavan itself
 yahaan tak ki pad chhodane ke baad bhi pranab mukherjee ne bhagwat ko khaane par bulaayaa tha
 In fact, Pranab Mukherjee's political personality has been so great that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself considers him as a father figure
 aresas ke liye ye kamyaabi jarur ho sakati he ki jindagi bhar aresas ke vichaaron par sawaal uthaane vaali ek badi raajnneetik hasti aaj uske ghar main mukhya atithi he
 This makes the Sangh feel that its ideology will be strengthened
 beti ne bhi pranab ko di naseehatudhar purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee nagpur pahunche or idhar ek khabar udi ki unki beti sharmishtha mukherjee ko bijepi pashchim bengal ke malda se chunavi maidan main utaar sakati he
 Sharmishtha tweeted two tweets about this news
 bijepi or aresas par prahaar karte hue unhone apane pita ko naseehat tak de daali
 Why did the RSS call such a political figure, Pranab Mukherjee, who was the first citizen of the country for five years, has identified a politician in the Congress ideology who has spoken about India's secularism and democratic values on every platform
 aise main sawaal he ki aresas ne ek aisi raajnneetik shakhsiyat ko kyon bulaayaa, jinaki vichaardhaara sangh se bilkul nahin milti
 One answer to this is that the Sangh has invited many such people to its programs in the past, including the leader of the Republican Party of India and Dalit thinker Dadasaheb Ramakrishna Suryabhan Gavai and leftist-minded Krishna Iyer
 or to or congress ke khilaaf har ladaai main aresas ne congress se nikle netaaon kaa samarthan kiya
 Did the Sangh choose Pranab wisely! During the Emergency in 1975, the RSS completely jumped into the JP movement
 yahaan tak ki 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar bani to purv congressi murarji desai ke naam par bhi sangh main sahmati thi
 In 1989, when VP Singh emerged as the hero of opposition unity against Rajiv Gandhi, BJP also stood with him in the shadow of the Sangh
 to kya congress se ladane ke liye ab sangh ne pranab mukherjee ke rup main ek aise netaa ko chunaa he, jinaki mahaan congressi viraasat hi congress ko kaategi
 The RSS took a different route from the beginning, the RSS was formed in 1925
 uske baad aresas naa to gandhi kii aguwai main chalane vaale andolan main hissedaar bani na hi congress se nikle netaji subhash chandra bose ke andolan main saajhedaar
 Nor did he ever deal with revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad
 naa 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan ke vakt aresas kii koi bhoomika dikhi
 At the time of independence, the Sangh even opposed the tricolor
 raashtra dhvaj kaa bhi virodh kar chukaa he sanghaareses ke mukhpatr da organijeshan ne 17 july 1947 ko neshnal flag ke naam se sampadakeey main likhaa ki bhagava dhvaj ko bharat kaa rashtriya dhvaj mana jaae
 On 22 July 1947, when the tricolor was considered the national flag, it was fiercely opposed by The Organization
 lekin ye bhi sahi he ki aaazaad bharat main aresas kii bhoomika dhire-dhire badhati gai
 Even the staunch opponents of the RSS started giving him space
 ek vakt nehru bhi ho gaye the sangh ke muridayshshsh ne dhire-dhire apni pahchaan ek anushaasit or rashtravaadi sanghathan kii banaai
 In 1962, the country was stunned by the fraudulent attack on China
 us vakt aresas ne sarahadi ilaakon main rasad pahunchane main madad kii thi
 Impressed by this, Prime Minister Nehru called the Sangh in the Republic Day Parade in 1963
 1965 main pakistan se yuddh ke dauraan dilli main trephic vyavastha sudhaarney main sangh ne madad kii thi
 In 1977, the RSS invited former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to inaugurate the Vivekananda Rock Memorial
 jab janata party banaate hue jaiprakash narayan ne aresas kii madad lee thi, tab unhone kaha tha ki agar jansangh phacist he to main bhi phacist hum
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has a history
 us itihaas kii ek kadi mahatma gandhi se bhi judati he
 Gandhi went to the Sangh program only once in his life and said the same thing in his heart there
 ab baari pranab mukherjee kii he
 Sangh has been banned thrice, Sangh has been banned thrice so far
 farvari 1948 main sangh par pehali baar tab pratibandh laga, jab hindu kattarpanthi nathuram godse ne gandhi kii hatyakar di
 That ban on the Sangh remained until July 1949
 duusari dafe immergency ke dauraan 1975 se 1977 tak sangh par pabandi lagi
 And the third time was for six months in December 1992, when the Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya on 6 December
 gandhi ne sangh ke hindutv ko kar diya tha khaarijazaadee kii taraf badhate hindustan main ek taraf rashtrapita mahatma gandhi the to ek taraf rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak emes golwalkar
 Gandhi's opinion towards the RSS was not hidden from anyone
 phir bhi 16 sitambar 1947 ko gandhi ji aresas ke dilli praant prachaarak vasantrao ok ke bulaave par bhangi basti kii ek shakha main gaye the
 First and last time
 vahaan gandhi ne saaf kar diya tha ki wo sangh ke hindutv ko nahin maanate
 The Sangh was first banned in February 1948 when Gandhi was assassinated by the Hindu fundamentalist Nathuram Godse
 sangh par wo pabandi july 1949 tak rahi
 Pranab had also made a serious allegation against the Sangh, Pranab Mukherjee himself, while a minister in the center, had made serious allegations against the Sangh
 vaise jis sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko aaj bijepi or sangh apana iken maanate hai, us patel ne bhi gandhi kii hatya ke saae main 18 july 1948 ko kaha tha ki- aresas kii gatividhiyaan sarkaar or rajya ke astitv ke liye jokhim bhari thim
 Reports suggest that such activities did not end despite the closure
 samay ke saath-saath aresas kaa sanghathan or avagya karata ja rahaa he
 Their insurgent activities are increasing
 to gandhi se lekar patel tak hote hue aaj sangh ke saamne congress se nikle or raashtrapati ke pad tak pahunche pranab mukherjee khadey hai
 If he speaks at the Sangh program in Nagpur, then he will also have that heritage of history in front of which his politics flourished

 Union Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi is retiring
 ritair hone se pehle unhone 'aaj tak' ko exclusive intervyuu diya he jisamen unhone saaf kaha ki dilli se baithkar haryana par tippanee karnaa samajhadaari nahin he
 In the current situation, Haryana has done the right thing to keep the situation under control
 iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaha ki kashmir main kanoon-vyavastha bigadane main pakistan kaa haath he
 According to Maharishi, Pakistan is funding separatists from across the border
 jis vajah se hurriyat netaaon ne kashmir ko apana vyapaar bana rakhaa he
 The NIA is investigating Hurriyet tapes
 maharishi kaa kahana he ki adhiktar kashmiri log kashmir main aman or shanti chaahate hai
 i do not want to be a victim of senselessness by commenting on Haryana sitting in Delhi, this situation is very dynamic if there is a question of law and order

 kashmir hamase alag nahibgar kuch pakistan se prerit yaa fundad aatankwaadi ho yaa stone pelter ho to sabake liye yah kahana galat main nahin maanata
 It is wrong to understand that Kashmiris are different from us or their aspirations are different from ours, their aspirations are the same that every person in India has to get a good job, good education, live their life peacefully
 kashmir main halaat bigaadane main bahari dakhaabhi jo ekstranal interference he vah zyada he
 Some people are misguided, there is an attempt to control them

 Call the heart button, your dreams are coming to blow 'tumhari Sulu' What is the story of the film's middle class family married woman, Sulu, who lives with her husband and child
 sulu kaaphi chanchal or khushmijaaj mahila he jo aksar radio ophers jitati rahati he
 But one day she sees that the contest has started to become a radio jockey
 sulu radio ke offis jaakar radio jocky banane kii ichha jaahir karti hai or is tarah radio par shuru hota he 'sari vaali bhabhi kaa let nite sho'
 In this, she talks to radio callers
 aage jo mjedaar baaten saamne aati hai wo aapako trailor dekhakar jaan sakate hai
 Your sulumjedar dialogues is the story of becoming a RJ from a common domestic woman - In this light-hearted comedy film, where Vidya's character is seen as very strong, its dialogues make you laugh
 - jab ek raat sulu kaa pati usase poochta he ki 'chalo ham milakar bijness shuru karte hai to sulu apane pati kii baat kaa jawaab dete hue kaaphi humras andaaj main kahati he - 'use partnership jamati nahin he'

 - In Nokzhok, Sulu's husband says - It is useless to face you
 sulu jawaab detii he- vaise bhi munh lage bahut din ho gaye
 Vidya, an unprofessional woman in the character of Sulu, becomes a radio jockey and the mistakes that are made there due to her nature turn into a humerus
 ise film main kaaphi bakhubi dikhaaya gaya he
 Vidya is being portrayed as a chillout person in the character of Sulu as a wife
 apane pati or bachche ke saath mastamaula andaaj main rahati sulu ko jab gift main preshracukar miltaa he to wo ghar kii jarurat ko dekhte hue use riples karke tivi kii maang karti he
 Vidya is kept perfectly natural in low makeup and sari look

 Controversy has arisen once again about Aamir Khan's film PK
 sharada peeth ke shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne ‘pike’ ko hindu dharm ke khilaaf bataaya he
 Swaroopanand says that such films should not be made and the censor board should not pass such films either
 aamir khan or nirmaataa rajkumaar hiraani kifilm ‘pike’duniyabar main safalataa ke jhande gadh rahi he
 But Shankaracharya has objected to the sarcasm done against Hindu deities in the film, saying that objectionable scenes were shot in the film
 unhone poocha ki aakhirkaar film banane waalon ko sirf hindu dharm main hi khot kyon najar aati he? shankaracharya ke kaha, film nirmaataa anya dharmon ke khilaaf film banaaenge to unhen ‘thik’ kar diya jayega
 The Muslim religious leaders also objected to some of the scenes shown in the film 'PK', an objectionable Muslim religious leader from PK
 muslim dharmaguru khalid rashid firangimahali ne kaha ki is film ke kuch seen behad aapattijanak hai or hinduon kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchaate hai
 He said, such scenes are also dangerous for our country's ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb
 shankaracharya ne shuukravaar ko paramhansi ganga ashram main bulaai gai vaarta main kaha ki ‘pike’ main devi devataaon par aapattijanak filmakan kiya gaya he
 After all, why talk of secularism is only for Hindus and not for other religions
 shankaracharya ne kaha he ki hindu devi-devataaon kaa apmaan kisi bhi paristhiti main bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Why make Hindu Gods and Goddesses a part of entertainment? Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati said that how the censor board issues certificates to such films, even the film makers do not know about the goddesses or the good people of the subject before making films on Hindu deities

 shankaracharya ne kaha ki sabase pramukh baat yah he ki aakhir ye film vaale hindu devi-devataaon ko manoranjan kaa paatr hi kyon banaate hai
 Making the faith of crores of people eligible for entertainment will no longer be tolerated
 shankaracharya ne kaha ki anya dharmon jaise muslim, isai aadi par film kyon nahin banaai jaati
 Because the film makers do not have the courage to make films on other religions, the film which will insult Hindu deities should be opposed, such films will not be tolerated

 The film critics as well as the audience have given a place to the entire team of Aamir and PK
 bina jati-majahab kaa bhed kiye darshak apni jeb dhili kar film dekh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question is how appropriate it is to put a film on the scales of religion
 agar vaaki kisi seen ko lekar aapatti he to darshakon ne ise kyon nahin nakaar diya
 After all what kind of problem with PK? maharashtra ke amravati jile ke dhamangaanv main ravivaar ko mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kii ek chunavi raily ke dauraan karj main duube ek kisaan ne jaharila padaarth pikar khudakushi karne kii koshish kii

 After that when Kapil started watching the show, he realized that the film should be made now

 sach yah he ki china utana peeche nahin hataa he, jitna vah bhartiya seemaa main pravesh kar gaya tha
 China entered the Indian border for 19 kilometers and has gone back only a few kilometers in the name of retreat
 akhirkaar china kii chaturaai ne hamen chit kar diya
 Neither our foreign policy worked nor diplomacy nor defense policy
 ham har morche par haar kaa tamaasha dekhte rahe, or china kii dagaabaziyon kaa
 China, which entered 19 kilometers from the border of Ladakh, also insulted its bag after 21 days, and made it dishonest
 bharat sarkaar ne aise dikhaaya jaise china ke saath sara jhagada sulajhaa diya ho
 But now it is learned that we have to pay a big price in return for this
 peeche hatane kii evaz main china kii pipuls libration army ne shart rakhi thi ki wo chumaar se apni sthaayee chaowkee hataa le
 In view of the increasing pressure in India, the government had to say yes to this situation
 or iske evaz main mila kya? 19 kilometre tak bhartiya seemaa main ghuse chini sainik 2 kilometre peeche sarak gaye
 Salman Khurshid was saying as if he owed the country
 sach to ye he ki desh ne 9 taarikh ko salmaan ke china daure kii qeemat chukaai he
 But he kept the country in the dark on behalf of the intelligentsia of China
 andhere main kyon rakhaa hindustan ko?desh ko laga tha ki sarkaar ne china kii dagaabaazi kii dawaai kar di he
 What did we know that this will be the cause of new pain
 china kii chalbaasiyon ke saamne ek na chali hindustan kii
 We went back more and ate the lollipop of China and waved to India
 wo do kilometre peeche hate or ham or unase zyaada peeche hatate chale gaye
 Lost the garrison separately
 or ye vaada bhi nahin le sake ki 15 april se pehle vaali sthiti china behaal karegaa
 If there is a rumor to lay arms before China, then why does the government not tell what is the truth
 china ke saath hamaara samjhauta kya he or chumaar kii chaowkee hamane ganvaai he yaa nahin?sarkaar to tab bolegi na jab sach uske paksh main hoga
 And at the moment the truth is that while talking with China, he is only setting the conditions and we are confident of his kindness and kindness
 or duniya kaa itihaas kahata he ki dayaa se do deshon ke rishton kii daraar ajtak nahin bhari gai
 Sources reveal that China is definitely removed from Ladakh, but not only that, it is removed with anything
 ek to china ko bhartiya seemaa se hatane ke liye raji karne main bharat ko samrik drushti se apni ahm chumaar post hataane par raji hona padaa
 At the same time, it is also news that 30 ITBP soldiers are posted on their old positions as compared to 50 soldiers of Chinese platoon
 ise sidhe-sidhe kaha jaae to china ne bhartiya sainikon ko apni hi seemaa main peeche dhakel diya he
 China did not back down just like that
 On Sunday evening, there was news that the dispute has been resolved and China has agreed to withdraw from the Indian border
 lekin, ab khabar he ki china ne aise hi apni jid nahin chodi, balki use raji karne main bharat ko samrik drushti se ahm chumaar post hataane par raji hona padaa
 20 days later, the Chinese army agreed to withdraw from Daulat Beg Oldi in eastern Ladakh, 19 kilometers of the Indian border, but, as much as the country is happy to resolve the conflict with China, there are as many concerns
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir adiyal china kaise maan gaya?umr abdulla ne bhi jataayaa ndehjammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne bhi somvaar ko apni chintaa jataate hue kaha tha, ‘keval yahi ek andeh he ki media kii khabaron main kaha gaya ki donon paksh peeche hate
 India and China retreated
 main ise lekar vismit hum ki bharat kahaan se hataa or bharat ko kahaan se hatana tha kyonki yah hamaara kshetra he, yah vaastavik niyantran rekha kaa hamaara kshetra he
 The Chief Minister said that Chinese soldiers had been regularly violating the Line of Actual Control, but it was after a long time that the Chinese set up tents in Indian territory of the Line of Actual Control
 buudhvaar ko pope francis ke saath trump kii meeting ke dauraan, melania trump ne kaale rang kaa lambii baaju kii ek dress pahani thi
 He also had his head covered
 bataa den ki isse pehle kai mahilaon ne bhi pope ke saath meeting ke dauraan aise kapade pahane the
 Other women present during the meeting, including Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, wore similar clothes
 saath hi sar par kaala kapadaa dhaka tha
 It is a little shocking that Melania in the Vatican, she did not wear a scarf when she went to Saudi Arabia
 soshal media par aise sawaal uth rahe he ki unhone aisa kyon kiya
 Her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in an email that Melania was following the Vatican protocol
 baithak main jitani bhi mahila thi un sab ne lambii aasteen ke kaale kapade or sir ko cover karne ke liye scorf pahana tha
 He did not wear it when he was not needed in Saudi
 pehle bhi kai mahilaon ne nahin pahane scornjab maharani elizabeth II pehle vatican kaa daure kiye the to apane mukut ke neeche kai baar scorf or blike dress pahana tha
 But in the 2014 tour, she wore a purple dress and hat
 mishael obama ne 2015 main jab pope se washington, disi main hawaii adde par mili thi to unhone nile rang kii dress pahani thi
 In Saudi Arabia, Muslim women are required to wear a scarf, but foreigners are not required to follow that dress code
 kuch pramukh mahilaon ne saudi arab ke aadhikarik daure ke liye scorf pahana he or kuch mahilaon ne nahin
 Like Melania Trump, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, who visited before, also toured the country without wearing a scarf
 melania kaa daura dharmik nahin thajen hampton cook ne kaha ki saudi ke daure ke dauraan melania trump ne scorf nahin pahana tha, lekin usne haathon or pairon ko puri tarah se dhanke hue kapade pahane the
 The trip to Melania was not for religious leaders or temple
 usne kaha ki saudi main mahilaaye sar cover karte hue kapade pahane hai
 While there are many Muslim women in the world who do not do this
 mishael ke sar naa dhakne kii gai thi alochanajab mishael obama ke 2015 ke daure ke dauraan jab unhone apana sar dhakne se manaa kiya tha to tha use ek bold raajnneetik bayaan kaha gaya tha
 At the time, President Donald Trump criticized Mitchell's decision by tweeting that, with many saying that Mrs
 Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, it was an insult to her
 hate hijaab ke siio melani eltark ne kaha he ki scorf ko alag-alag logon dwaara galat samajhaayaa gaya he or ise zyada raajnneetik mudda bana diya gaya he

 Despite the numerous train accidents across the country, the negligence of the railway administration is not taking the name of stopping
 railway adhikariyon ko na to yatriyon kii suraksha or suvidha kii parvaah he or na hi apni jimmedaari kaa ehsaas
 Now such a feat has come to the fore, which has surprised everyone
 dilli se maharashtra ke liye ravaanaa huitrain railway prashasanaki galati kii vajah se madhya pradesh pahunch gai
 The train ran in the wrong direction for 160 km, but neither the railway administration nor the driver was aware of it
 jab train madhya pradesh ke banmor stesan pahunchi, tab jaakar driver ko hosh aayaa ki train galat root main ja rahi he
 Thankfully there was no major accident during this period
 kisaan yatra raily main hissaa lekar maharashtra laut rahe the kisanarelway prashasan kii is laaparvaahee kaa khamiyaja saikadon yatriyon ko bhugatna padaa
 These passengers got stuck at Banmore station
 ab railway adhikariyon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki wo kya karen? darasal, saikadon kisaan maharashtra se dilli ke jantar-mantar main kisaan yatra raily main shaamil hone aae the
 When these farmers were returning to Maharashtra, a special train was arranged for them from Delhi to Maharashtra
 160 kimi galat disha main daudti rahi trainyah train dilli se ravaanaa to maharashtra ke liye hui thi, lekin pahunch gai madhya pradesh
 The interesting thing is that the train continued in the wrong direction for 160 km, but no officer and employee of the railway administration got the idea of it
 railway prashasan ke gaiyr jimmedaar ravaiye kii vajah se ye kisaan apane ghar pahunchane kii bajaay madhya pradesh ke banmor stesan main funs gaye
 The wrong signal found in Mathura is that the wrong signal was given to the train at Mathura station, due to which the train moved towards Madhya Pradesh instead of Maharashtra
 kolhapur ja rahe ek yatri ne bataaya ki railway prashasan kii is laaparvaahee ke chalate yatri kareeb 5-6 ghante tak madhya pradesh ke banmor stesan main fanse rahe
 Passenger Madan Naik, who was stranded at Banmore, said that when he asked the driver of this train, he argued that the wrong signal was given in Mathura station
 driver ne kaha ki galat signal ke chalate yah gadabadi hui or train madhya pradesh aa gai
 He informed that now the train will reach its destination on Thursday morning
 itnaa hi nahin, is maamle ko lekar abhi tak railway ke kisi adhikari ne yatriyon se baatcheet tak nahin kii
 The Aam Aadmi Party may accuse the BJP of conspiring to arrest its mlas, but Prashant Bhushan, once an important part of the party, has raised big questions on Arvind Kejriwal
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet karte hue prashanth bhushan ne aam aadmi party ke maujuuda vidhayak kartaar singh kii ek shikaayat saamne rakhi he
 According to Prashant Bhushan, he and Yogendra Yadav demanded an inquiry into 12 candidates in the list of proposed candidates prepared before the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections
 lekin prashanth bhushan kaa daawa he ki kejariwal ne tamaam shikayaton ko nazarandaaj kiya tha
 Prashant Bhushan said that Arvind did not put the names of the proposed candidates on the website when the 2015 elections were held
 pataa ye bhi chalaa ki kartaar singh, sharad chouhan or pramila tokes ke khilaaf gambhir aarope hai
 About Kartar, we said that he has left the BJP
 iskaa AAP kii vichaardhaara se lenaa dena nahin he
 He was a junior engineer at Jalboard, and gained so much property
 inke paas form house, flats hai
 We said that tickets should not be given without investigation
 tikat dene se pehle jaanch nahin kiprashanth bhushan ke mutabik dilli vidhansabha main chunaav se pehle prastaavit ummidavaaron kii jaanch karne ke liye ek file lokapal ko bheji gai thi, lekin sahi jaanch nahin hui
 Prashant Bhushan said that the Lokpal had 5 days to investigate 12 candidates because the election was head on
 kaiyon kaa thos saboot nahin mila to use chetavanee dene ko kaha
 For the moment, we directly assume the mistake of aerodynamics
 bina paardarshita ke tikat nahin dena chahie tha
 With the arrival of the AAP, Bhushan opened more liquor shops, alleging that the Kejriwal government has given the right to the liquor shops to the mlas
 prashanth bhushan ne 'aaj tak' se kaha ki aam aadmi party ne kaha tha ki mohalla sabha ke bina ham sharaab kii dukaan nahin khulne denge, lekin ab uske khilaaf vidhayak ko takat de di gai he
 In RTI, 58 new liquor contracts were opened and due to this the excise of the government also increased
 aage prashanth bhushan ne aage kaha ki punjab ko nasha mukt kaa daawa karne vaale dilli main nasha badha rahe hai
 More power to the Delhi Assembly, however, Prashant Bhushan has supported giving more strength to the Delhi Assembly
 unhone kaha ki sabko pataa tha, jaisaa samvidhan he, usamen har kaam alji ke apruval karne se hoga
 Any commission, transfer will also be from the approval of LG
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar ne is baat ko nazarandaaj kiya
 i believe that the Delhi Assembly needs to be given more strength
 centre sarkaar se adhikaron kii ladaai ke maamle main kejariwal sarkaar ke supreme court kaa rukh karne vaale sawaal par prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki kanoon ke hisaab se mujhe nahin lagata ki aam aadmi party supreme court main safal hogi
 Delhi government needs to give more rights and change the constitution, but work in the rights that are there
 bhaashanon ke alaava aaj bharat main kuch nahin hua
 The speeches are good in the speeches, but there is no speech about the wind
 un shaharon main bhi nahin he jinka naam duniya ke pradooshit shaharon main aa gaya he
 Today a report has come out that in 2017, 1
2 million people died due to air pollution in India
 ab sochie 12 lakh logon kii maut kii khabar ai ho, chunaav chal rahe hon magar is sawaal par koi bhaashan nahin he
 Our former colleague Hridayesh Joshi wrote on this today that the report of an institution called State of Global Air is telling that 1
2 million people died in India in the year of 2017 due to air pollution
 agar koi yah soch rahaa he ki chunaav main paryaavaran mudda kyon nahin he to use pakkaa chunaav chhod kar ipel yaa WWF dekhnaa chahie
 Think there is no wind in the speeches
 baaja he or baazi he
 a report by Khushboo Narayan of Indian Express reported that 88 lakh taxpayers could not file tax returns in the year of demonetisation
 kyon nahin ritern bhar paae kyonki notebandi ke baad aarthik gatividhiyaan thahar gayi or logon kii naukari chali gai
 Income decreased
 usee vakt ye aankada aata to in 88 lakh logon ko sammanit kiya jaataa
 Contributing to the end of black money by losing one's job is not a joke
 khushboo narayan kii yah report behad gambhir he
 Think that the decision of which 88 lakh people have lost their jobs, or they are not able to file tax returns, they should at least give a certificate of demonetisation
 ritern farm bharna or tex dena donon main antar hota he
 The government had stated that the number of those filing income tax returns in 2016-17
 06 karod bad gai
 While the number of staff filers increased 10 times this year
 staff filers wo hote hai jo pichley saal ritern bharte hai magar kamai na hone par agle saal nahin bharte hai
 Number of staff filers 8 in 2015-16
 56 lakh thi jo 2016-17 main 88 lakh se adhik ho gai
 At the time of demonetisation, the bankers who understand the service of the country every day write why i am not talking about increasing their salary
 bankeron ke kaitiyaron ne jurmaane ke taur par apni jeb se khub paise bhare
 Filled with a loan
 ab unki duusari musiibat shuru ho gai he
 The bank itself is forcing them to buy loans of the same bank whose daily condition they see
 bankeron ko notebandi ke samay laga tha ki ve sainik hai or arthshaastri bhi hai
 All the bankers wanted to do something for the country, what is wrong with it
 haa, wo kaam desh ke liye tha yaa nahin, iskaa jawaab kahaan he
 It is true that he worked hard but it is also true that his salary did not increase
 bankeron ko selary or share kaa sawaal raajnneetik dalon se karnaa chahie
 Or mind the IPL score, watch the WWE as soon as the match is over and the Hindu Muslim debate soon after, guaranteed that ten to twenty years will be fun
 aap sab sakshi hai ki bankeron kii baat maine rakh di he ab aap unase kahie ki mujhe whatsap na karen
 i understand the agony of bankers
 kya karen
 MTNL and BSNL employees recently held demonstrations over the crisis in their institute and non-payment of salary
 ab agar hawa par baat nahin ho rahi he jisase 12 lakh log mar gaye, notebandi par baat nahin ho rahi he jisase naukari jane ke kaaran ritern nahin bharne vaale staff filers kii sankhya bad gai to kisi ko yah ummid kyon honi chahie ki rashtrawaad or sena se chunaav kaa gear badal kar BSNL or MTNL main hazaron kii naukari chali jane ke sawaal par chunaav ho jayega
 Just telling the number that millions of people work in these former Navratnas does not become an issue
 khabar ai ki BSNL MTNL ke 54000 karmchaariyon ko swechha se ritair karaane ke liye mantralay ko chunaav ayog se anumati leni hogi
 That means, even at the time of the election, how did the idea of leaving 54000 employees come? itane log maidan main aa jaaen to netaa log twit karne lagate hai or peeche se ve 54000 logon ko chalata karne kaa plan bana rahe hai
 It was reported that the company's board has accepted the proposal that the age will be reduced to retire
 deccan herald main yah khabar chhapi thi
 At the moment the ceo's statement has come that we will not expel anyone in this way
 ham ek aakarshak viares kii niti lekar aana chaahate hai jo karmchaariyon ko bhi pasand aayega
 Is this election being held on the army? kyonki sena kaa bhaashanon main bahut zikr aa rahaa he
 It was said earlier that it is wrong to question the army
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki chunaavon main sena kaa istamaal karnaa galat he
 What is right about the army, what is wrong, everything is confusing
 kai baar lagata he ki barrack kaa chunaav ho rahaa he yaa bharat kaa ho rahaa he
 When did the Indian Army become Modi's army? yogi ji ke bayaan par chunaav ayog vichaar kar hi rahaa tha
 Naqvi Ji called Modi ji's army
 idhar purv senadhyaksh ve ke singh sirius ho gaye
 If you are a BJP candidate, you have said this on the statement of Yogi ji, who could not even say Urban Naxalites
 bibisi ke jugal purohit ko intervyuu main kaha ki agar koi kahata he ki bharat kii sena modi kii sena he to vah galat nahin, deshadrohi bhi he
 It is treason to say Modi's army
 ve ke singh kii is baat ko aap sirf note kar lijie
 But avoid showing it to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 email ke draft main seve karke rakh lijiega
 Sometimes the messenger gets stuck between two leaders
 kitna acha idia tha jeenyu ke visi kaa
 The tricolor march took place on 24 July 2017 in JNU on Kargil Vijay Diwas
 media main jeenyu ke visi kaa bayaan chapa tha ki uniwarsity main tanks rakhana hoga taaki chaatr javaanon ke balidaan se parichit ho saken
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi also supported
 sochie agar is idia par kaam hota to seemaa se zyada collejon main tanks hote
 There are over 39000 colleges in India
 tii 90 tanks 15-16 karod kaa aata he
 It is so cheap that 39000 tanks would be bought and placed in an order
 is par chah lakh karod se adhik hi to kharch aata
 This amount is nothing for nationalism
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki har college main khilone vaala tanks hi laga diya jaae taaki baby-neshniljam to aati rahe
 If we had bought old tanks, then all the second-hand tanks in the world would have stood in front of colleges in India
 thik he ki kasbon ke collejon main teacher nahin hai, hai to padhaate nahin hai, lekin agar saare college main tanks laga dete to bina teacher ke chaatr kam se kam rashtravaadi banakar to nikalate
 They are becoming unemployed
 ye behad sad baat he
 The public is fighting with its issues
 vah tay nahin kar paa rahi he apane anubhav or muddon kaa kya kare
 The leaders of the media and speeches have imposed their issues on it
 jaise aap bihar jaaen cover karne to naujavaanon se sawaal ho saktaa tha ki aap jis college main padhate hai uskaa seshan time par he yani 3 saal kaa bie 3 saal main hota he yaa 5 saal main hota phir poocha jaataa ki aap 3 saal kaa bie 5 saal main karte hue pulavama ke bare main kya sochate hai to uskaa kya jawaab hoga
 But did the students of Bihar, on their behalf, convey this problem to the journalists who came from Delhi
 bataae hote to patrkaar zarur likhte
 Today i tell you about a new movement

 Magadh University is the largest university in Bihar
 2016-19 satr ke liye bie, biessi, bikom ke liye admician liya
 This admission was done in June 2016 but the first year examination took place in January 2018
 teen saal biit gaya he magar first year kii hi pariksha hui or riselt aayaa
 There has been no examination for the 2017-20 season
 2019 aa gaya he
 Students said that more than 4 lakh students study in the 2016-19 and 2017-20 sessions
 3 saal kaa bie 5 saadhe paanch saal main ho rahaa he
 At Bihar University, phones keep coming for the session late
 magadh uniwarsity kaa ek or maamla he
 Unrelated college students
 inaki sankhya 80,000 se adhik he
 Their result was stuck in the case lawsuit and they could not fill the railway examination form
 baaki lakhon chaatro ko bhale na padataa ho magar jinka kariyar barbaad ho rahaa he unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa
 It was believed that if it comes in prime time, then there will be an examination, but their trust is broken
 teen chaar dafe bolne or likhane ke baad bhi kamyaabi nahin mili
 Now these students have launched the Magadh University Late Examination movement on youtube
 yah video aap dekh paae yahi bahut badi baat he
 What is happening to students in state capitals and towns cannot be described in words
 isiilie meraa yakeen he ki in samasyaon ko dabaane ke liye hi hindu muslim or rashtrawaad jaise muddon ko aage kiya jaataa he
 Imagine four million students doing a three-year BA in 5 years
 kisi ko fark nahin padataa
 It is very possible that these students do not matter
 ve ipel or WWE dekhne main vyast hon, magar jin chand chaatro ne yah pahal kii he unhen badhai
 There should be research at Oxford University on how doing a 3-year BA in 5 years within a university improves students' youth
 is research ko harvard main launch karnaa chahie or dilli ke gymkhana club main is par charchaa honi chahie
 Do you think that the students of Bihar University and Magadh University will get relief
 mujhe nahin lagata
 The students are requested not to send me a thank you message
 bihar ke netaaon ko badhai
 Congratulations to the students as well
 inhone sabit kar diya he ki sab kuch kariyar nahin hota he
 IPL and WWF are also something

 sushant or kriti pehali baar on-screen ek saakh dikhaai degen
 The film 'raabta' is scheduled to release on 9 June
 landan main chhuttiyaan manaate dikhe sushant or kriti In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, a young woman has accused Gangrep and forcibly trying to convert
 maamla meerut ke kithore thana kshetra kaa he jahaan rahane vaali ek yuvati kaa aarope he ki use kareeb 6 maheene tak agra main bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya
 During this, he was gang-raped and then tried to get converted
 darasal, police ko die bayaan main peedita ne bataaya ki wo meerut ke ek photo dukaan main naukari karti thi
 About 8 months ago, a teacher from the village introduced him to a young man named Manish Gaur
 peedit ladki ko bataaya gaya ki manish ek bada bijness main he or agra main uski kai factriyaan hai
 The woman alleges that Manish took her to Agra on the pretext of getting her a servant, where she was taken hostage
 is dauraan manish or uske bhaanje piyush ne uskaa rape kiya or dharm parivartan karaane kii koshish kii
 He and his family were also threatened with death if they protested
 kareeb do maheene pehle mauka paa kar peedit ladki bhaag kar waapas meerut aa gai
 Fearing the accused, the victim remained silent for about two months, but when patience broke her dam, she told the police her emergency
 police ne tunrat rape kaa maamla darj kar liya, haalanki police ne exiaar main dharm parivartan kii shikaayat nahin kiye jane kii baat kahi he
 The police has started investigating this case
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish or karnataka ke purv lokayukta santosh hegade ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane main kuch bhi galat nahin he, kyonki vah bhi anya lok sevakon kii tarah hai
 What is the great thing about the Prime Minister? Justice Hegde said, 'what is wrong with the Prime Minister being in the ambit of Lokpal? Is the Prime Minister not a public servant? Are there no corruption cases against Prime Ministers in other countries? a prime minister is prosecuted in Japan every other year
 (purv america raashtrapati) nicksan par mukadmaa chalaa
 What is so great about the Prime Minister? Hegde said that corruption charges have been leveled against Indian Prime Ministers in the past and only the President and Governors are exempt from prosecution and not the Prime Minister
 2 purv piem kaa udhaaharan diyounhone kaha, ‘hamane boforce or jeemem rishwatakhori maamle main do purv pradhanmantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope dekhe the
 In democracy, how can a person be exempted from prosecution simply because he is in a position? The constitution exempts the president and governors from prosecution in certain cases
 kisi aise vyakti par yah siddhant lagu nahin ho saktaa jo niyamit aadhaar par kaaryakari aadesh jari karte hon
 Asked what are the expectations of Arvind Kejriwal's newly formed 'aam Aadmi Party', 'hegde said it was not an easy task
 unhone kaha, ‘meri ashanka sirf yah he ki aajkal ke maahaul main raajnneetik vyavastha kii itani maangon ke kaaran koi raajnneetik dal kaise khud ko barkaraar rakh paaegaa
 From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, a huge amount of money is required for the election of about 546 members of Parliament
 yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 "even in the judiciary, irregularities," said Hegde, "theoretically it's a good thing, but can it really be successful
" ’ nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar ko lekar kejariwal ke sambhavit khulaason ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘kya hamane nyaaypalika main aniyamittaaon ke bare main nahin suna? ucchtam nyaayalay ke ek nyaayadhish the jinke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru hui thi lekin yah puri nahin hui
 a Chief Justice against whom impeachment proceedings began
 nyaayamurti dinaakaran, jinhone istipha de diya isliye kaarywahi samaapt ho gayi
 Hegde said, 'saumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court was
 unke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru hui or band ho gayi, aage kahin nahin pahunchi
 Charge sheet was filed against Justice Nirmal Yadav of Punjab High Court
 elahabaar ucch nyaayalay ke 34 nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch kar rahi he
 'he said,' So there is corruption there too and they will definitely have some material against some judges
 ’majboot lokapal kii jaruratkya nyaaypalika ke bheetar bhrashtachar par niyantran ke liye aatm-niyaman ek tarika he, is sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘hamane iskaa prayaas kiya or isamen safalataa nahin mili
 We tried it for so many years
 nyaaypalika ke bare main sabhi ne kaha ki ham aatm-niyaman karenge, ham niyantran karenge, ucch adaalatein nichali adaalaton par najar rakhengi
 Nothing happened
 ’ hegade se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah aisa lokapal chaahate hai jise nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf jaanch karne or un par mukadmaa chalaane kaa adhikaar ho to unhone sahmati jataai
 He said, 'who will investigate the judges? There must be someone
 aap sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon kii ek alag jaanch satarkta ikai chaahate hai to ise banaaen, yah thik he lekin yah bhi jaanch ke daayre se baahar nahin honi chahie

 zindagi barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana aapane dekha he? bharat main mahanagaron se lekar zilon main zindagi barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana khulaa hua he, jise ham angrezi main uniwarsity or hindi main vishvavidhyalay kehete hai
 The beauty of this factory is that the one whose life is ruined does not matter
 jo barbaad kar rahaa he use bhi koi fark nahin padataa
 80% of BA and MA students have failed this year at Doctor Ram Manohar Lohia University in Uttar Pradesh
 jis uniwarsity main chaar lakh se adhik chaatr fail ho jaaen wo duniya kii sabase badi khabar honi chahie
 Have you heard that 80 percent of Oxford, Howard, Michigan University students failed? And nobody seems to mind
 hindi akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskaran main vishvavidhyalay is baat kaa shrey le rahaa he ki is baar video camere laga kar nakal roak di gai, isliye itane chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The university administration would not have made such claims if there were no limits of stupidity
 aakhir is uniwarsity ke collejon main padhai kaa str itnaa karaab kyon he ki bina nakal kii pariksha hone par 80 pratishat chaatr fail kar jaaen
 Vice Chancellor, Principal, Professor and Lecturer then come for that university
 kya yahaan fail hone kii padhai hoti he? yah bharat hi nahin vishwa ke shiksha jagat kii bhayankar ghatana he, jise bukamp or sunami kii tarah cover kiya janaa chahie tha
 That is why i said that in India in the name of university, factories have been opened to waste students from towns to metros
 faizabad main he ye doctor ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity
 This university has mostly government-aided and private colleges
 inaki sankhya 600 se adhik bataai jaati he
 There are many colleges where 10,000 to 20,000 students study
 2017-18 main bie biessi, bikom ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki 300 chaatro ke liye ek permanent professor hai or do adahak hai
 There are four papers in Mathematics in the final year
 aap isse bhi andaaza laga sakate hai ki naujavaanon ke jivan ke saath kis tarah kaa khilwaad ho rahaa he
 This college has more than 18000 students
 agar sthaayee shikshak nahin honge, unhen acchhee tankhwaah nahin milegi to padhayega koun
 It is easy to take credit for stopping the copying, but whether the copying has been stopped or the last minute change in the examination
 yah bhi ek gambhir sawaal he
 BA and MA students will give objective type answers then what is the meaning of higher education
 kai shikshakon ne pahchaan gupt rakhte hue bataaya ki chaatro ko objective system kaa koi abhyaas nahin tha
 Anyway, a student of geography and biology will prove that he has knowledge of the subject without drawing in detail
 ganit main number is baat ke bhi milte hai ki aakhir tak sawaal ke hal karne kaa rasta kitna sahi tha sirf aakhir hal par hi nahin milte hai
 But most of the students who failed are in the third year, where questions were asked as before
 yah sari jaankaree chaatro se mili he
 Are you not surprised to hear that a poor state university charges Rs 3000 for a copy check again? ek copy ke teen hazaar
 If a student wants to check three copies then he has to give 9000
 is hisaab se 4 lakh chaatro ne dobaaraa jaanch ke aavedan kiye to uniwarsity ke paas in garib chaatro kii jeb se nikal kar 120 karod aa jaaenge
 Isn't this a robbery? Most of the students in the areas where the colleges of Awadh University are in are from poor or ordinary families
 unke liye 3000 kii raashi bahut he
 It is clearly written on the university's website that a student dissatisfied with the observation of the answer book will be able to apply for the challenge evaluation within 15 days from the date of receipt of the answer book by paying a fee of Rs 3000 per question paper
 yahi nahin number dene or badalane kii sharten bhi copy jatil hai yani tay he ki chaatr ke 3000 bhi doobenge
 Is the youth being deliberately ruined in such a way so that they can understand the propaganda of whats app only and knowledge only
 ye sawaal bharat ke naujavaanon ko khud se poochna he
 Seeing the condition of Varna University, i can give a theory here without taking Nobel that if you want to ruin the youth of any country easily then it is India
 bas naujavaanon ko aap kisi uniwarsity main bhej dijie
 a student who pays 4000 fees for a year will give 21000 to get the copy checked again, is it not an injustice
 agar yah anyaay or dakaiti nahin he to phir kya he
 The students have sent the information, and have recorded it themselves
 hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki kai marksheet dekhne par pataa chalata he ki chaatr ko ek paper main 75 main 60 number aae hai magar duusare paper main zero aayaa he
 If there is no problem then why was the registrar and exam controller removed
 awwal to aisi gadabadi hui kyon
 If the results are not correct, what will happen to the students who pass the BA and go to the competition examination
 unke kariyar ke saath ye khilwaad kyon ho rahaa he
 You will know the condition of Bihar University where not a single examination was conducted in the year of 2017
 mumkin he vahaan ke chaatr bhi saal bhar whats ap hindu muslim propeganda main vyast or mast honge
 By the way, in our university series on October 17, we had told the condition of this Ram Manohar Lohia University
 tippaniyan About 11000 students were registered in Kamta Prasad Sundar Lal Saket Post Graduate College, the largest college in Ayodhya
 yahaan 145 regular shikshak hone chahie the, magar us vakt 85 hi the
 The charisma of teaching 85,000 teachers to 11000 students can happen only in India where the children of ministers never come to study
 unke bachche vahaan padhane jate hai jahaan 20 chaatro par ek professor hota he
 Teachers tell that in many colleges the number of teachers on paper will be met, but they are not there at all
 yah bhi ek kism kaa ghotaalaa he
 Many aided teachers teach in the aided college, but the management, which the management puts on salary of 15-20 thousand, is not interested nor qualified
 yah bhi sochie ki 20,000 kii selary par padhaane vaale lekturer kii kya gunvattta hogi
 Think otherwise it will be too late and such colleges will have ruined crores of youth forever
 isse pehle ki ghar-ghar main noujvaan teen-teen saal uniwarsity main guzaarane ke baad kisi laayak na bane, ham apane sawaal badal len
 The leaders have thrown the youth into the mud
 noujvaan us keechad se apni barbaadi kii holi khel rahaa he
 When do you ask that 6 AIIMS does not have 70 percent teachers? bina teacher ke ames jaise sansthaanon se aapkaa baccha kis tip kaa doctor ban kar nikal rahaa he
 Think how much hard work it takes to get elected in institutions like AIIMS
 aap sochie kya vah bharat behatar ho saktaa he jiske naujavaanon ko, jisaki javaani ko barbaad karne kii factriyaan khuli hui hai
 In the local edition of Hindi newspapers, the university is taking credit that this time the copying was stopped by installing video cameras, so many students have failed
 morrkhtaa kii had na hoti to vishvavidhyalay prashasan is tarah ke daawey nahin karata
 After all, why is the level of education in the colleges of this university so bad that 80 percent of the students fail in the examination without cheating
 us uniwarsity main vaais chancelar, principal, professor or lekturer phir kis liye aate hai
 Is there a failure to study here? This is not only a terrible incident in the world of education, but in India, which should have been covered like earthquake and tsunami isiilie maine kaha ki bharat main uniwarsity ke naam par kasbon se lekar mahanagaron tak main chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana khulaa hua he
 This doctor is Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University in Faizabad
 is uniwarsity main zyaadaatar garvanment aded or privet college hai
 Their number is said to be over 600
 kai college aise hai jahaan 10,000 se lekar 20,000 tak chaatr padhate hai
 In 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level 1
5 lakh students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 One student said that for 300 students there are one Permanent Professor and two are Adahk
 final year main ganit main chaar paper hote hai
 You can also guess what kind of messing up with the lives of young people
 is college main 18000 se adhik chaatr padhate hai
 If there will not be permanent teachers, they will not get good salary, then who will teach? nakal roak dene kaa shrey lenaa aasaan he, lekin kya sirf nakal roki gai yaa phir pariksha main aakhri vakt main badlaav kiya gaya
 This is also a serious question
 bie or eme kaa chaatr objective tip jawaab dekar nikalegaa to phir ucch shiksha kaa matlab kya hua
 Many teachers kept the identity secret, stating that students had no practice of objective systems
 vaise bhi bhugol or jeev vigyaan kaa chaatr bina rekha chitra banaae, vistaar se samajhaae kaise sabit karegaa ki use vishay kaa gyaan hua he
 Numbers in Mathematics are also found that how right the way to solve the question was till the end, only the solutions are not found
 lekin fail hone vaale zyaadaatar chaatr tisare varsh ke hai, jahaan pehle kii tarah hi prashn pache gaye
 All this information has come from the students
 kya aapako yah sunakar hairaani nahin hui ki ek garib rajya kii uniwarsity dobaaraa copy check karne ke liye 3000 rupee leti he
 Three thousand copies
 agar kisi chaatr ko teen copy kii jaanch karaani he to use 9000 dene honge
 Accordingly, if 4 lakh students apply for re-examination, then the university will get 120 crores out of the pocket of these poor students
 kya ye dakaiti nahin he? avadh uniwarsity ke college jin ilaakon main hai vahaan ke zyaadaatar chaatr garib yaa saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 3000 is a lot for them
 uniwarsity kii website par saaf saaf likhaa he ki uttar pustika ke avlokan se asantusht chaatr uttar pustika milane kii taarikh se 15 din ke andar 3000 rupee prati prashnptr kii dar se shulk kaa bhugtan kar chalange eveluation ke liye aavedan kar sakegaa
 Not only this, copying the number and changing the conditions is also complicated, ie it is certain that 3000 students will also drown
 kya jaanboojh kar yuvaaon ko is tarah se barbaad kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve sirf or sirf whats ap ke propeganda ko hi gyaan samaj saken
 These questions have to be asked by the youth of India
 varna uniwarsity kii haalat dekhakar ek siddhant bina nobel liye yaheen pratipaadit kar saktaa hum ki agar kisi desh kii javaani ko aasaani se barbaad kar dena he to wo bharat he
 Just send the youth to a university
 jo chaatr saal bhar kii fees 4000 detaa he wo copy dobaaraa check karaane ke liye 21000 degaa kya yah anyaay nahin he
 If it is not injustice and robbery then what is it? chatro ne hi jaankaree bheji he, or khud hi record kar bheja he
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava said that after looking at many marksheets, it is found that the student has got 60 numbers out of 75 in one paper but zero in the other paper
 agar gadabadi nahin he to phir register or pariksha niyantrak ko kyon hataaya gaya
 Why was there such a mess at the top? agar rigelt sahi nahin hue to bie paas kar pratiyogita pariksha main jane vaale or aage padhane vaale chaatro kaa kya hoga
 Why is this messing with his career? aapako bihar uniwarsity kaa haal to pataa hi hoga jahaan 2017 ke saal main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 It is possible that the students there will also be busy and busy in whats up Hindu Muslim propaganda throughout the year
 vaise hamane apni uniwarsity series main 17 aktubar ko is ram manohar lohia uniwarsity kaa haal bataaya tha
 The comments ayodhya ke sabase bade college kamta prasad sundar laal saket post graduate college main kareeb 11000 chaatr-chatraayen registerd the
 There should have been 145 regular teachers here, but only 85 at that time
 85 shikshakon par 11000 chaatro ko padhaane kaa karishma sirf us bharat main ho saktaa he jahaan mantriyon ke bachche kabhi padhane nahin aate hai
 Their children go to study where 20 students have one professor
 shikshak bataate hai ki kai collejon main kaagaj par shikshakon kii sankhya puri milegi magar ve vahaan hote hi nahin hai
 This is also a kind of scam
 aded college main bahut se permanent shikshak padhaate to hai magar management jin shikshakon ko 15-20 hazaar kii selary par rakhata he unki dilchaspee nahin hoti or na hi yogya hote hai
 Also think what would be the quality of lecturer teaching at a salary of 20,000
 sochie varanaa bahut der ho jaaegi or aise college karodon naujavaanon ko hameshaa ke liye barbaad kar chuke honge
 Before the youngsters from house to house do not become fit after spending three-three years in the university, let us change our questions
 netaaon ne naujavaanon ko keechad main phenk diya he
 The young man is playing his ruined Holi with that mud
 aap kab puuchhenge ki 6 ames main 70 fisadi shikshak nahin hai
 What type of doctor is your child leaving from institutions like AIIMS without a teacher? sochie ames jaise sansthaanon main chune jane ke liye kitna parishram karnaa hota he
 Do you think that India can be better whose youth, whose factories to waste their youth, are open
 faizabad main he ye doctor ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity

 This college has more than 18000 students
 agar sthaayee shikshak nahin honge, unhen acchhee tankhwaah nahin milegi to padhayega koun
 It is easy to take credit for stopping the copying, but whether the copying has been stopped or the last minute change in the examination
 yah bhi ek gambhir sawaal he
 BA and MA students will give objective type answers then what is the meaning of higher education
 kai shikshakon ne pahchaan gupt rakhte hue bataaya ki chaatro ko objective system kaa koi abhyaas nahin tha
 Anyway, a student of geography and biology will prove that he has knowledge of the subject without drawing in detail
 ganit main number is baat ke bhi milte hai ki aakhir tak sawaal ke hal karne kaa rasta kitna sahi tha sirf aakhir hal par hi nahin milte hai
 But most of the students who failed are in the third year, where questions were asked as before
 yah sari jaankaree chaatro se mili he
 Are you not surprised to hear that a poor state university charges Rs 3000 for a copy check again? ek copy ke teen hazaar
 If a student wants to check three copies then he has to give 9000
 is hisaab se 4 lakh chaatro ne dobaaraa jaanch ke aavedan kiye to uniwarsity ke paas in garib chaatro kii jeb se nikal kar 120 karod aa jaaenge
 Isn't this a robbery? Most of the students in the areas where the colleges of Awadh University are in are from poor or ordinary families
 unke liye 3000 kii raashi bahut he
 It is clearly written on the university's website that a student dissatisfied with the observation of the answer book will be able to apply for the challenge evaluation within 15 days from the date of receipt of the answer book by paying a fee of Rs 3000 per question paper
 yahi nahin number dene or badalane kii sharten bhi copy jatil hai yani tay he ki chaatr ke 3000 bhi doobenge
 Is the youth being deliberately ruined in such a way so that they can understand the propaganda of whats app only and knowledge only
 ye sawaal bharat ke naujavaanon ko khud se poochna he
 Seeing the condition of Varna University, i can give a theory here without taking Nobel that if you want to ruin the youth of any country easily then it is India
 bas naujavaanon ko aap kisi uniwarsity main bhej dijie
 a student who pays 4000 fees for a year will give 21000 to get the copy checked again, is it not an injustice
 agar yah anyaay or dakaiti nahin he to phir kya he
 The students have sent the information, and have recorded it themselves
 hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki kai marksheet dekhne par pataa chalata he ki chaatr ko ek paper main 75 main 60 number aae hai magar duusare paper main zero aayaa he
 If there is no problem then why was the registrar and exam controller removed
 awwal to aisi gadabadi hui kyon
 If the results are not correct, what will happen to the students who pass the BA and go to the competition examination
 unke kariyar ke saath ye khilwaad kyon ho rahaa he
 You will know the condition of Bihar University where not a single examination was conducted in the year of 2017
 mumkin he vahaan ke chaatr bhi saal bhar whats ap hindu muslim propeganda main vyast or mast honge
 By the way, in our university series on October 17, we had told the condition of this Ram Manohar Lohia University

 The charisma of teaching 85,000 teachers to 11000 students can happen only in India where the children of ministers never come to study
 unke bachche vahaan padhane jate hai jahaan 20 chaatro par ek professor hota he
 Teachers tell that in many colleges the number of teachers on paper will be met, but they are not there at all
 yah bhi ek kism kaa ghotaalaa he
 Many aided teachers teach in the aided college, but the management, which the management puts on salary of 15-20 thousand, is not interested nor qualified
 yah bhi sochie ki 20,000 kii selary par padhaane vaale lekturer kii kya gunvattta hogi
 Think otherwise it will be too late and such colleges will have ruined crores of youth forever
 isse pehle ki ghar-ghar main noujvaan teen-teen saal uniwarsity main guzaarane ke baad kisi laayak na bane, ham apane sawaal badal len
 The leaders have thrown the youth into the mud
 noujvaan us keechad se apni barbaadi kii holi khel rahaa he
 When do you ask that 6 AIIMS does not have 70 percent teachers? bina teacher ke ames jaise sansthaanon se aapkaa baccha kis tip kaa doctor ban kar nikal rahaa he
 Think how much hard work it takes to get elected in institutions like AIIMS
 aap sochie kya vah bharat behatar ho saktaa he jiske naujavaanon ko, jisaki javaani ko barbaad karne kii factriyaan khuli hui hai

 aap sochie kya vah bharat behatar ho saktaa he jiske naujavaanon ko, jisaki javaani ko barbaad karne kii factriyaan khuli hui hai
 Not only this, copying the number and changing the conditions is also complicated, ie it is certain that 3000 students will also drown
 kya jaanboojh kar yuvaaon ko is tarah se barbaad kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve sirf or sirf whats ap ke propeganda ko hi gyaan samaj saken
 These questions have to be asked by the youth of India
 varna uniwarsity kii haalat dekhakar ek siddhant bina nobel liye yaheen pratipaadit kar saktaa hum ki agar kisi desh kii javaani ko aasaani se barbaad kar dena he to wo bharat he

 If it is not injustice and robbery then what is it? chatro ne hi jaankaree bheji he, or khud hi record kar bheja he

 Why is this messing with his career? aapako bihar uniwarsity kaa haal to pataa hi hoga jahaan 2017 ke saal main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 It is possible that the students there will also be busy and busy in whats up Hindu Muslim propaganda throughout the year

 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said on Sunday that the exact number of people who were victims of severe floods in Uttarakhand will never be known
 unka andaja he ki is traasadee main marane waalon kii sankhya saikadon se lekar hajaaron main ho sakati he
 Bahuguna said, "we will never be able to find out exactly the number of people who died, those who were buried under debris or were swept away by the flood waters
" vidhansabha adhyaksh govind singh kunjwaal ne shanivaar ko kaha tha ki maare gaye logon kii sankhya 10 hajaar tak ho sakati he, lekin mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki yah aankada galat he
 Amidst the difficulties of people trying to normalize life after a terrible tragedy, he said, 500-600 bodies can be seen, not only in Kedarnath area, but across the state
 mukhyamantri ne halaat se nipatane ko lekar pradesh sarkaar kii aalochana tathaa ise maanav nirmit traasadee bataae jane ko khaarij kiya
 Bahuguna said that as far as the missing people of the state are concerned, the district administration will work on it
 unhone kaha, apane rajya ke peedit logon ko ham muaavja denge or is kaam ko jaldi kiya jayega
 He said that as far as the people of other states are concerned, they should lodge complaints in their states
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, yadi rajya, uttarakhand ko is baat kii pushti karte hai ki unke rajyon ke log tirthayatra par yahaan aae the or itane tirthayatriyon ko mrit maan liya janaa chahie or itane log waapas nahin laute
 
 
 Then we will accept their point and the compensation will be given to the Chief Secretaries concerned to distribute the compensation to the victims of their states
 bahuguna ne kaha, diaiji rank ke adhikari kedarnath main hai or unhen shavon ke antim sanskaar kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 The funeral procession continues
 unhone bataaya, jo laashen galiyon main padi hai unka antim sanskaar ho rahaa he
 The bodies of many people are trapped in the buildings in which they were living, but some machines are needed to get them out
 kuch jesibi mashine uplabdh karai ja rahi hai
 Bahuguna said that the Air Force and Public Works Department are deciding the design of JCB, which will be taken to these places by helicopters
 unhone bataaya, jo shav rambada main pade hai, un tak koi pahunch nahin saktaa
 But the question is what should we do so that the environment is not polluted
 kuch rasayan or powder kaa istemaal karnaa padegaa
 When asked about the criticism about the action on the disaster, he said that there was a very quick response from the army and the government
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, koi deree nahin hui
 It only took them time to get there due to bad weather and road connectivity problems
 lekin jab ve pahunche, to badi sachai yah he ki hajaaron logon ko nikaala gaya or pichley kuch dinon main ek lakh se adhik logon ko bina vahaan kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya hue nikaala gaya
 The credit should go to the state government that there was no law and order problem there
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki vahaan 200 se adhik gaanv the, jahaan koi sampark nahin tha or inkaa punarnirmaan karnaa hoga
 a survey has been done for this and experts will be consulted
 tippaniyan He told, food will be sent to these villages
 kaam pragati par he
 We are sending food, so that the villagers can live for two months
 raahat saamagree jila mukhyalayon par rakhi hui hai
 The Chief Minister said that raw routes will be made to all the places in the week so that some connectivity can be restored
 unhone kaha, koi gaanv aisa nahin choda jayega, jahaan raahat saamagree nahin pahunche
 This is our priority
 is kaam main kuch samay lagegaa, kyonki monsoon ke dauraan pakki sadaken nahin banaai ja sakati
 Bahuguna said, i do not agree with you that this is a man-made disaster
 aapadaaon par hamaara niyantran nahin he
 i cannot stop the occurrence of tsunami, earthquake or cloudburst
 aise halaat main main kya kar saktaa hum ki kaise main apane logon kii jaan bachaaun
 Disasters are not under our control
 bahuguna ne kaha, ham un logon kii sankhya kaa sahi-sahi pataa kabhi nahin laga paaenge, jo maare gaye, jo log malbe main dabe rah gaye yaa baadh ke pani main bah gaye
 Assembly Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal had said on Saturday that the number of casualties could be up to 10,000, but the chief minister said the figure was incorrect
 bhayanak traasadee ke baad jindagi ko saamaanya karne kii jaddojahad main jute logon kii mushkilon ke bich unhone kaha, 500-600 shav dekhe ja sakate hai, na keval kedarnath ilaake main, balki puure rajya main
 The Chief Minister dismissed criticism of the state government for handling the situation and terming it a man-made tragedy
 bahuguna ne kaha ki jahaan tak rajya ke laapata logon kaa sawaal he, jila prashasan is par kaam karegaa
 He said, we will give compensation to the suffering people of our state and this work will be done quickly
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tak anya rajyon ke logon kaa sawaal he, unhen apane rajyon main shikaayatein darj karaani chahie
 The Chief Minister said, if the states confirm to Uttarakhand that the people of their states had come here on pilgrimage and that so many pilgrims should be considered dead and not so many people returned
 
 
 tab ham unki baat ko sweekaar karenge or sambandhit mukhya sachivon ko muaavja raashi unke rajyon ke peediton ko vitarit karne ke liye di jaaegi
 Bahuguna said, DIG rank officer is in Kedarnath and has been entrusted with the responsibility of cremation of the dead bodies
 antim sanskaar kii prakriya jari he
 He told that the dead bodies lying in the streets are being cremated
 bahut se logon ke shav un imaaraton main fanse pade hai, jinamein ve rah rahe the, lekin unhen baahar nikaalane ke liye kuch mashiinon kii jarurat he
 Some JCB machines are being provided
 bahuguna ne bataaya ki vayusena or lok nirmaan vibhaag jesibi ke dizin aadi kaa faisla kar rahaa he, jinhen helicopteron se in jagahon par le jaaya jayega
 He said, no one can reach the dead bodies lying in Rambada
 lekin sawaal yah he ki ham kya karen, jisase ki paryaavaran pradooshit nahin ho
 Some chemicals and powder will have to be used
 aapadaa par karrwai ko lekar ho rahi aalochana ke sambandh main sawaal kiye jane par unhone kaha ki sena or sarkaar kii behad twarit javaabi pratikriya thi
 The chief said, there was no delay
 keval kharaab mausam or sadak sampark kii samasya ke chalate unhen vahaan pahunchane main samay laga
 But when they arrived, the big truth is that thousands of people were evacuated and in the last few days more than one lakh people were evacuated without having law and order problems there
 iskaa shrey rajya sarkaar ko janaa chahie ki vahaan kanoon-vyavastha kii koi samasya nahin thi
 The Chief Minister said that there were more than 200 villages where there was no contact and they would have to be rebuilt
 iske liye ek surveykshan kiya gaya he or visheshgyon se salaah-mashvira kiya jayega
 The comments unhone bataaya, in gaanvon ke liye bhojan bheja jayega
 working in progress
 ham khaanaa bhej rahe hai, taaki gramin do maah tak guzaara kar saken
 Relief materials are kept at district headquarters
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki saptaah bhar main sabhi sthanon ke liye kachche raste banaae jaaenge, taaki kuch sampark behaal ho sake
 He said, no village will be left where relief materials are not reached
 yah hamaari praathamikta he
 This work will take some time, because the paved roads cannot be built during the monsoon
 bahuguna ne kaha, main is par aapse sahamat nahin hum ki yah maanav nirmit aapadaa he
 We do not control disasters
 main tsunami, bukamp yaa badal fatne kii ghatana ko nahin roak saktaa

 BJP needs 145 MLA to prove the fact that what happened on Saturday in Maharashtra politics was unexpected
 subah khabar ai ki devendra fadanvis mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath le rahe hai
 Shortly afterwards, Fadnavis took oath along with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar
 lekin is shapath grahan ke baad rajya kii raajnneeti tej ho gai
 The Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, engaged in the exercise of forming the government, went into full action after this incident and by late night Sharad Pawar assured these parties that all was under control
 agar ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar daawa karte hai ki sab thik he to aise main mana jaae ki lagaataar duusari baar sarkaar banane ke chakkar membhartiya janata party (bijepi)kahin bhavar main to nahin funs gai
 After Fadnavis was sworn in with Ajit Pawar, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had said that the NCP does not support the newly appointed government in the state
 yahaan tak ki sharad pavaar ne apni press conference main un vidhayakon ko bhi pesh kiya jo ajit pavaar ke saath shapath grahan ke dauraan maujuud the
 The game played on the strength of the letter was alleged by NCP Chief Sharad Pawar that Ajit Pawar composed the entire game on the strength of a letter
 party ke vidhayak dal ke netaa ke rup main ajit pavaar ke paas sabhi party vidhayakon ke hastakshar the or vah yahi chitthee lekar rajyapal ke paas chale gaye
 Ajit Pawar presented this letter as a support to the mlas
 ensipi vidhayak rajendra shingane ne bataaya ki ajit pavaar ne 8 se 10 vidhayakon ko phone kiya or unhone dhananjay munde ke bangale par aane ko kaha
 When we all reached the bungalow, we were taken to the Governor's residence from there
 lekin hamen kuch bhi nahin pataa tha ki rajyapal nivas kyon le jaaya ja rahaa he
 After a while Devendra Fadnavis suddenly came and took the oath of Chief Minister
 siem devendra fadanvis ke baad ajit pavaar ne dipti siem pad kii shapath lee
 In the meeting of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar (ANI) Sharad Pawar after the swearing-in, 42 MLA Sharad Pawar also alleged that the letter which was handed over to Ajit Pawar by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was signed by 54 mlas
 But it was misrepresented
 shapath grahan ke baad mumbai main jabardast raajnneetik gahamagahami rahi
 Sharad Pawar convened a meeting of all NCP mlas
 haalanki party kii ore se kaha gaya ki sabhi vidhayakon ke aane ke baad hi baithak shuru hogi
 Sharad Pawar waited for a long time and then started the meeting and evicted his nephew from the leader of the party Legislature Party
 ajit pavaar ke saath shapath grahan samaaroh main dikhne vaale dhananjay munde shaam ko sharad pavaar kii baithak main shaamil ho gaye
 Jayant Patil, who was elected the new leader of ncp's legislature party in the meeting, claimed that 42 of the 54 mlas attended the meeting
 jabaki 7 vidhayak sampark main hai
 The 49 legislators will attend the meeting on Sunday
 haalanki 5 vidhayakon se sampark nahin ho paa rahaa he
 What will the BJP do now, if the mlas taking part in the NCP meeting led by Sharad Pawar? If Sharad Pawar has managed to save his party from break-up and prevent his mlas from joining Ajit Pawar's camp, then what will be the way forward for BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 105 siten mili thim jabaki sahyogi shivasena ko 56 siton par jeet mili thi, lekin baad shivasena bijepi se alag ho gai
 The BJP has 105 mlas and it needs the support of 145 mlas to prove its majority in the 288-member assembly and is 40 steps away from this magic number
 aise main agar ajit pavaar ke kheme main chand vidhayak hi rah gaye hai to bijepi kahin us chitthee ke jhaanse main to nahin aa gai
 Please tell that Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has clearly said that there are only four mlas with Ajit Pawar
 aise main sawaal ye bhi khadey ho rahe hai ki agar supreme court floor test kaa aadesh detaa he or sharad pavaar apni party ke vidhayakonsaath rakhane main kaamyaab rah pate hai to bijepi ke liye lene ke dene bhi pad sakate hai

 There has been a dispute over former Congress president Rahul Gandhi's alleged statement on Kashmir
 pakistan ne rahul gandhi ke bayaan ko hathiyaar banaakar sanyukt raashtra (yuan) ko chitthee likhi he
 In a letter written by Pakistan's Human Rights Minister Shirin Mazari, it was claimed that after the removal of Article 370, Rahul Gandhi referred to the deaths of people in Jammu and Kashmir
 'bataa den ki ravivaar ko congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek twit kar kaha, 'jammu-kashmir ke logon kii swatantraaa or naagarik aazaadee par ankush lagaae hue 20 din ho gaye hai

 Later, the leaders also took it prominently and introduced it among the people

 com / plwakjm5w5— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) August 25, 2019 Pakistani Human Rights Minister Shirin Mazari said, 'india's mainstream politicians like Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi had accepted that people are dying in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan (kashmir) bahut galat ho rahaa he
 Shirin Mazari also referred to the statement of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, in which Khattar had given a statement related to marrying Kashmiri girls
 rahul gandhi ke bayaan ko lekar pakistan ke is daawey ko congress khaarij kar chuki he
 More recently, Shirin Mazari accused Twitter of favoring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government
 tivetor ne kashmir maamle main farji khabaren failaane ko lekar pakistan ke kareeb 200 acounts ko suspend kar diya tha
 In this case, the screenshot of the mail of the Twitter notice was shared by Pakistan's Human Rights Minister Shirin Mazari on social media
 unhone iske saath likhaa, "tivetor prabandhan kharaab modi sarkaar kaa pravaktaa banane main bahut aage nikal gaya
 They have sent notice to our President! Very tasteful and completely ridiculous
 " There are around 850 living languages in India and about 250 languages went extinct in the last 50 years
 yah baat jane-maane bhashavid ganesh devi ke santhaan bhashaa research and publication centre dwaara ‘bhartiya bhashaaon ke lok surveykshan’ (pielesai) main jaahir hui
 With regard to the findings of the first of its kind survey conducted 100 years after the language survey conducted between 1894-1928 under the leadership of John Abraham Grierson, an Indian Administrative Service officer during the British rule, Devi said, 'india has about 850 living languages
 Of which, we could study 780 languages and if we consider the 1961 census as the basis, then in these 50 years, 250 languages were extinct
 'vadodara vishvavidhyalay main 1996 main angreji ke praadhyaapak rahe 63 varshiya devi ne kaha ki pielesai ne jin 780 bhashaaon kaa adhyayan kiya unamem se 400 bhashaaon kaa vyakaran or shabdkosh taiyaar kiya gaya
 Assuming that some 100 of these languages have been studied before, the record of 300 of these languages has never been prepared outside the community speaking those languages
 is surveykshan ke nishkarsh ko 68 khandon main kareeb 35,000 pannon kii rapat ke swaroop main bharat ke pehle up-raashtrapati es radhakrishna ke janmdin ke maukey par manaae jane vaale ‘shikshak diwas’ ke avasar par agle paanch sitambar ko jari kiya jayega
 He said that more than 400 languages speak tribal and nomadic and non-notified tribes
 yadi hindi bolne waalon kii taadaad kareeb 40 karod he to sikkmi main majhi bolne waalon kii taadaad sirf chaar he
 Devi said that the survey also included languages that have less than 10,000 speakers as the census under a well-thought-out strategy to end the fear of linguistic conflict in the country after the 1971 Bangladesh war
 It was discontinued to include languages that have fewer than 10,000 speakers
 devi ne kaha ki isliye 1961 kii janaganana main jahaan 1,652 bhashaaon kaa zikr he vahiin 1971 main ye ghatakar 182 ho gai or 2001 main yah 122 rah gai
 It is worth mentioning that the basis of assuming language in the census is different, so of the 1,652 languages mentioned in 1961, we can actually give 1100 language status

 is tarah se kumaraswami sarkaar ko ek din kaa jeevandaan or mil gaya he, to vahiin bijepi kii ummiido ko bada jhatka laga
 The BJP was confident that if there was a vote of confidence, the Kumaraswamy government would have fallen
 ab bijepi ke paas kya vikalp hai aaie jaanate hai
 The BJP can go to the Governor again and say that a time limit should be set for a vote on the trust vote, if the Governor also sets the time limit, then whether the speaker will accept it, there is a lot of doubt
 haalanki rajyapal ne spikar se kaha he ki shuukravaar dopaher dedh baje vishwaas mat kaa pareekshan kiya jaae
 It remains to be seen whether the Speaker will obey the Governor's order or ignore it in the same manner as it has done today
 agar vishwaas mat par voting ko taala jaataa rahaa to phir bijepi avishvaas prastaav laa sakati he
 The speaker may take 14 days to accept the motion of no confidence
 agar congress or jedies vishwaas prastaav ko waapas lete hai to phir bijepi ko avishvaas prastaav laana hoga
 It is also being said that both BJP and Congress can go to the Supreme Court
 bijepi floor test ke liye supreme court main guhaar laga sakati he
 BJP is standing on the strength of voting on the vote of confidence as soon as possible so that Congress and JDS do not get more time
 vaise bhi satr shuru hone ke baad se congress or jedies ko chah din kaa samay mil chukaa he

 One of the four convicts facing the death penalty in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, claiming that he was a minor at the time of the crime in December 2012
 doshi pawan kumaar gupta kii yachika ko guuruuvaar ko sunwaayee ke liye nyaayadhish suresh kumaar kait ke samaksh soochibaddh kiya gaya tha
 On Thursday, the court ordered the hearing on the issue to be postponed to January 24, but after the protests by Nirbhaya's family, the Delhi High Court has decided to hear the case on Thursday itself
 court master ko kaha gaya he ki wo pawan gupta ke vakeelon ko adaalat main bulaae
 Pawan Kumar Gupta said in his petition that Section 7A of the JJ Act provides that the claim of being a minor can be made in any court and the issue can be raised at any time even after the final disposal of the case
 is
 ghatana ke samay naaballig ghoshit karne kaa anurodh karte hue pawan ne aarope lagaaya ki jaanch adhikari ne uski umr kaa pataa lagane ke liye haddiyon sambandhi jaanch nahin kii usne juvenil justise kanoon ke tahat chhot kaa daawa kiya
 The court sentenced Pawan to death and is lodged in Tihar Jail
 usne anurodh kiya ki sambandhit praadhikaran ko uske naaballig hone ke daawey kaa pataa lagane ke liye haddiyon sambandhi jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 Apart from Pawan, the three other accused in the case are Mukesh, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh
 gauratlab he ki nirbhaya gangrape or hatya maamle main doshi akshay kumaar singh kii punarvichaar yachika ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Akshay's death sentence will remain intact
 nirbhaya gangrape or hatya maamle main doshi akshay kumaar singh kii punarvichaar yachika par justise aar banumati, justise ashok bhushan or justise e es bopanna kii peeth main buudhvaar ko sunwaayee kii thi
 The court had said that there is no basis for reconsideration, the court said that the trial court, the High Court and the Supreme Court had already given the correct verdict
 diggaj ection nirdeshak viru devgan ke bete abhinayta ajay devgan kaa kahana he ki vah bollywood filmon ke mardhaad vaale drishyon se ub chuke hai or yahi vajah he ki vah apni aagaamee film 'shivaay' ko isse alag karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Ajay said, 'I did a lot of action and it didn't bother me
 lekin ab main ub gaya hum
 So i thought of doing something other than this
 ' The actor, known for his action sequences in his films, said that he rarely used stuntmen and so shooting 'shivaay' was difficult for him
 unhone kaha, 'shooting acchhee rahi
 Wounded but nothing serious

 But now i am bored
 isliye maine isse itar kuch karne ke bare main sochaa
 ' apni filmon main mardhaad vaale drishyon ke liye pahachaane jane vaale abhinayta ne kaha ki vah bahut kam hi stantaman kaa istemaal karte hai or isliye 'shivaay' kii shooting unke liye mushkil rahi
 He said, 'shooting was good
 ghayal hue lekin kuch gambhir nahin tha
 Comments 'shivaay' 2008 kii romantic film 'you me or ham' ke baad ajay ke nirdesan kii duusari film he

 sani deal kii charchit film 'mohalla asee' kaa trailor li ho gaya he
 The trailer, which was released on youtube, looks quite disputed
 varanasi ke tourism ke maujuuda haal ko bayaan karne vaali film'mohalla assi'kii kahani kashinath singh ke hindi upanyaas 'kaashi kaa assi' par besd he
 The leaked trailer of the film contains many bold scenes as well as offensive dialogues
 trailor main dikhaae gaye ek seen main bhagwaan shiv apane bhakt ko gaali dete najar aa rahe hai
 Not only this, Actorsani Deol, who never abused in her film career, is also seen using objectionable language in this film
 dow
 Directed by Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, the film also stars Sakshi Tanwar and Ravi Kishan
 dekhen film 'mohalla assi' kaa trailor: Bhagat Singh was born on 28 March 1907 and was hanged by the British on 23 March 1931
 kehete hai ki desh ke liye shahid hone waalon kii umr vahiin ruk jaati he
 It seems like Bhagat Singh is still among us
 23 varsh ke banke or vidrohi noujvaan
 Those who are considered a symbol of protest, relentless struggle, revolution and socialism
 jinka maananaa tha ki vyaktiyon ko kuchal kar ve vichaaron ko nahin maar sakate
 Who intended to sharpen the sword of ideas at the edge of ideas
 bhagat singh ko paidaa hue 110 saal ho chuke hai magar unka lekhan or chintan aaj pehle kii tulana main kahin adhik praasangik ho gaya he
 He had attacked that imperialism and communalism at that young age
 unki lekhnee or vichaaron ko dekh kar is baat kaa andaja lagaana mushkil ho jaataa he ki kaise ek 23 varshiya noujvaan na sirf vaktavy balki krititv main bhi bade-bado ke kaan kaatane kii kshamta rakhata he
 On such an occasion, his very famous article "why i am an atheist?" Was written by Bhagat Singh for all of you
 Are sharing
 yah lekh unhone swatantraaa senaanee bhai randhir singh kii tippanee main likhaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that Randhir Singh was once unhappy about Bhagat Singh's haircut and refused to meet Bhagat Singh
 ve khud ko sachcha sikh maanate the or unka aisa maananaa tha ki prasiddhi ne bhagat singh kaa dimag kharaab kar diya tha
 At the same time, Bhagat Singh was also committed to getting his neck cut for the country
 unhone aise samay main hi is dastavej kii rachana kii thi
 You too read this famous article of his
 
 
 ek nayaa prashn uth khadaa hua he
 Do i not believe in the existence of God Almighty, omnipresent and omniscient due to any ego? Some of my friends - perhaps by saying so i am not gaining too much authority over them - are eager to reach the conclusion that i am going beyond the necessity of something by denying the existence of God and in my little contact with me Boasting has somewhat provoked me to this mistrust
 main aisi koi shekhi nahin bagharta ki main maanviya kamazoriyon se bahut upar hoon
 i am a human being, and nothing more
 koi bhi isse adhik hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 This weakness is also within me
 ahankaar bhi mere swabhaav kaa ang he
 i was called autocratic among my comrades
 yahan tak ki mere dost shri batukeshwar kumaar dutt bhi mujhe kabhi-kabhi aisa kehete the
 i have also been condemned on many occasions as an arbiter
 kuch doston ko shikaayat he, or gambheer rup se he ki main anachaahe hi apane vichaar, un par thopata hoon or apane prastaavon ko manavaa letaa hoon
 This is true to some extent
 isse main inkaar nahin karata
 It can be called ego
 jahaan tak anya prachlit maton ke mukaable hamaare apane mat kaa sawaal he
 i am definitely proud of my opinion
 lekin yah vyaktigat nahin he
 It may happen that it is justified pride in its faith and it cannot be called arrogant
 ghamand to swayan ke prati anuchit garv kii adhikta he
 Is it unreasonable pride that led me to atheism? Or that i disbelieved God after studying this subject very carefully and considering it carefully? i have completely failed to understand how unreasonable pride or grown-up is in the way of believing in God Can snag occur? i do not recognize the greatness of a truly great person - this can only happen when i too have received a little fame which i either do not deserve or i do not have the qualities that are necessary for it
 yahan tak to samaj main aata he
 But how can it be that a person, who believes in God, suddenly stops believing in him because of his personal ego? Only two ways are possible
 yaa to manushya apane ko ishwar kaa pratidwandvi samajhane lage yaa vah swayan ko hi ishwar maananaa shuru kar de
 In both these situations he cannot become a true atheist
 pehali avasthaa main to vah apane pratidwandvi ke astitv ko nakaarta hi nahin he
 Even in the second stage, he assumes the existence of a consciousness that conducts all the activities of nature from behind the curtain
 main to us sarvashaktimaan param aatma ke astitv se hi inkaar karata hoon
 It is not arrogance that motivated me to accept the doctrine of atheism
 main na to ek pratidwandvi hoon, na hi ek avatar or na hi swayan paramatma
 To disprove this allegation, let us consider the facts
 mere in doston ke anusaar, dilli bam cese or lahore shadyantra cese ke dauraan mujhe jo anaavashyak yash mila, shaayad us kaaran main vruthabhimani ho gaya hoon
 My atheism is not of recent origin
 maine to ishwar par vishwaas karnaa tab chhod diya tha, jab main ek aprasiddh noujvaan tha
 At least one college student cannot cultivate any undue ego that leads him to atheism
 yadhyapi main kuch adhyapakon kaa chaheta tha or kuch anya ko main acha nahin lagata tha
 But i have never been a hardworking or educated student
 ahankaar jaisi bhaavana main fasane kaa koi mauka hi na mil sakaa
 i was a very shy boy who had some pessimistic nature about the future
 mere baba, jinke prabhaav main main bada hua, ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji hai
 An Arya Samaj is anything but an atheist
 apni praathmik shiksha puri karne ke baad maine di
 a
 ve
 Entered school in Lahore and stayed in his hostel for a whole year
 vahaan subah or shaam kii prarthana ke atirikt main ghanton gayatri mantra japa karata tha
 i was a devotee in those days
 baad main maine apane pita ke saath rahanaa shuru kiya
 As far as religious orthodoxy is concerned, he is a moderate person
 unheen kii shiksha se mujhe swatantrata ke dhyey ke liye apane jivan ko samarpit karne kii prerana mili
 But they are not atheists
 unka ishwar main drudh vishwaas he
 They used to encourage me to pray and pray every day
 is prakaar se meraa paalan-poshan hua
 Entered the National College in the days of non-cooperation Movement
 yahan aakar hi maine sari dharmik samasyaon– yahan tak ki ishwar ke astitv ke bare main udaartaapurvak sochna, vichaarna or uski aalochana karnaa shuru kiya
 But i was still a firm believer
 us samay tak main apane lambe bal rakhata tha
 Although i could never believe in the mythology and principles of Sikhs or other religions
 kintu meri ishwar ke astitv main drudh nishtha thi
 Later i joined the revolutionary party
 vahaan jis pehle netaa se meraa sampark hua ve to pakkaa vishwaas na hote hue bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kaa saahas hi nahin kar sakate the
 On my persistent inquiries about God, he would say, 'when you want, then do worship
 ' yah naastikta he, jisamen saahas kaa abhaav he
 The other leader, whom i came in contact with, is a firm devotee, respected comrade Shachindra Nath Sanyal, currently serving life imprisonment in connection with the Kakori Conspiracy Case
 unki pustak ‘bandi jivan’ ishwar kii mahima kaa jor-shor se gaan he
 They have showered him with flowers on God because of the mystic Vedanta
 28 janvari, 1925 ko puure bharat main jo ‘di revolutionari’ (krantikari) parchaa baanta gaya tha, vah unheen ke bauddhik shram kaa parinaam he
 It praises the Almighty and his actions and actions
 meraa ishwar ke prati avishvaas kaa bhav krantikari dal main bhi prasphutit nahin hua tha
 All the four martyrs of Kakori spent their last days in hymns and prayers
 ram prasad ‘bismil’ ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji the
 Despite his extensive studies in socialism and communism, Rajen Lahiri could not suppress his desire to pronounce the verses of the Upanishads and the Gita
 maine un sab main sirf ek hi vyakti ko dekha, jo kabhi prarthana nahin karata tha or kahata tha, ‘'darshan shaastra manushya kii durbalata athwa gyaan ke simit hone ke kaaran utpann hota he
 He is also serving a life-long banishment sentence
 parantu usne bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kii kabhi himmat nahin kii
 By this time i was only a romantic idealist revolutionary
 ab tak ham dusron kaa anusaran karte the
 Now the time had come to take responsibility on his shoulders
 yah mere krantikari jivan kaa ek nirnaayak bindu tha
 The call of 'study' was echoing in the corridors of my mind - study to be able to face the arguments put by the opponents
 apane mat ke paksh main tark dene ke liye sakasham hone ke vaaste padho
 i started studying
 isse mere puraane vichaar or vishwaas adbhut rup se parishkrut hue
 Romance was replaced by serious ideas, no more mysticism, nor superstition
 yatharthwaad hamaara aadhaar bana
 i got a lot of opportunity to read about many ideals of world revolution
 maine araajaktaavaadi netaa bukanin ko padhaa, kuch samyawad ke pita marks ko, kintu adhik lenin, tratski, va anya logon ko padhaa, jo apane desh main safaltaapurvak kranti laaye the
 They were all atheists
 baad main mujhe niralamb swami kii pustak ‘sahaj gyaan’ mili
 It had mystic atheism
 1926 ke ant tak mujhe is baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya ki ek sarvashaktimaan param aatma kii baat, jisane brahmand kaa srijan, digdarshan or sanchaalan kiya, ek kori bakawaas he
 i showed my disbelief
 maine is vishay par apane doston se bahes kii
 i was a declared atheist
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de don, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi
 We, like people, do not throw bombs on our innocent people
 ek din subah si
 I
 di
 Senior Superintendent of India Mr
 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have punishment for hanging and hanging me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hoon yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hoon
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hoon
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he?ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karuun? main jaanata hoon ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahan yaa yahan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot dedicate their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or in heaven after death
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 I'm realistic main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hoon
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa?gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hoon ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he?tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hoon ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjeewaadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hoon
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hoon ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a person when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo unchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko unchaa samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa?mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, phaansi, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin poonjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjeewaadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho!kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hoon? thik he, main tumhen bataata hoon
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaayen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhane ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles with manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hoon
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhanti phaansi ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir unchaa kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hoon
 We have to see how i can play
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 argedy netaa or bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is not the only prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections

 tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki congress vipakshi dalon main sabase badi party he or 2019 caloksabhaa chunaavamein sabhi vipakshi partiyon ko ekajute kar ek saath laane kii jimmedaari rahul gandhi par he
 Tejashwi said that any leader of the opposition party who will protect the constitution will accept him as the Prime Minister

 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye tejasvi yadav ne nitish kumaar ko narendra modi se behatar pradhanmantri ummidavaar bhi bataaya
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar has been very experienced as an MP, as Chief Minister or as a Union Minister and the NDA should declare him the prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 haal hi messkshay kumarstarar film 'kesari' kaa poster relies kiya gaya
 There was such a thing in this poster that some people raised objections
 puure desh main hindi diwas kii vajah se hindi pakhwada manaaya ja rahaa he
 But during this time, the poster of Akshay's film was accused of dishonor in Hindi language
 darasal, poster par film ke hindi tital ko "roman lipi" main likhaa gaya tha
 This is not the first time this has happened
 hindi cinemaaki tamaam filmon ke posters par likhi gai saamagree roman main hi hoti he
 In a way, it is "fraud" with a script of a language
 nirmaataa-nirdeshak jis bhashaa main filmein banaakar karodon kamaate hai, usee bhashaa kii lipi ko tavajjo nahin dete
 Dialogues and songs in Hindi cinema films are in Hindi, but its posters and credit lines are often written in Roman
 amitabh bachchan or randeep hooda jaise gine-chune sitaron ko chhod den to hindi cinema ke zyaadaatar abhinayta hindi main likhnaa pasand nahin karte
 Amitabh often writes in Hindi on his social account
 kya abhinaytaon ko hindi bolne main aati he shame?sani leyoni yaa dakshin ke un sitaron kii baat samaj main aati he jinhen hindi samajhane yaa bolne main dikkat hoti he
 But those actors who come from a Hindi background - do not prefer to speak in Hindi on public occasions
 zyaadaatar abhinayta hindi main tab jawaab dete hai jab koi hindi main hi sawaal karata he
 However, there are many actors in it who also like to answer the question in Hindi only in English
 ye abhinaytaon kii ore se apni rojgaar kii bhashaa ke saath anadar bhi he
 The language in which actors earn name and fame by working in films, their honesty towards it on public occasions is not trustworthy
 haalanki shahrukh khan, aamir khan, salmaan khan, akshay kumaar jaise kalakaar hindi main sawaal puche jane par hindi main or angreji main sawaal puche jane par angreji main hi jawaab dete hai
 Most new stars do not see this approach to spoken Hindi
 kis audiyans ke liye ban rahe hai aise poster ?maujuuda samay main zyaadaatar filmein multiplex main relies honi he
 With the elimination of the single screen, a big change can be seen in the presentation of the posters of the films
 zyaadaatar filmon ke poster roman yaa angreji vaale tital ke saath najar aate hai
 However, this is not the case with films made in South or other Indian languages
 hindi main bhi pehle aisa nahin hota tha
 If you look at the posters of old films, then the titles of films were written in Hindi and Urdu along with English
 hindi cinema jagat ko hindi ke prati hin bhaavana se baahar nikalnaa hoga
 It would be better to promote Hindi in posters and subtitles of films

 He will be better with time, he told cricket website ESPN Cricinfo, 'it (performance abroad) will get better with time
 australia main bitaye gaye samay se maine kaaphi anubhav hasil kiya he
 i created opportunities to take wickets and put a lot of pressure on the batsmen
 australia main ek din main 30 over karnaa mere hisaab se ek spinner ke liye saraahneey prayaas he
 If you ask me whether you would like to take 25 wickets or bowl well, i would say bowling well because i know that it will also give you wickets
 'upmahadweep main kaaphi acha he aswin kaa pradarshanapako bataa den ki upmahadweep kii pichon par aswin kaa pradarshan kaaphi acha rahaa he
 He played 23 of 16 Test matches here
 87 kii ausat se 100 wicket liye hai
 However, Ashwin 56 in nine Tests played overseas
 58 kii ausat se sirf 24 wicket hi hasil kar paae hai
 i will do well soon
 Ashwin further said, 'maybe one day i can get six wickets in Australia in one day and i can say that this is what i wanted to achieve
 maine dakshin africa main ek test khelaa he or england main do test khele hai
 If i play a Test in India, i can get five wickets immediately, but maybe it is in the third or fourth Test match in England or South Africa
 aisa nahin ho paaya lekin jald hi aisa ho saktaa he
 "desire to play an important role for the team overseas," Ashwin said, adding that he wanted to play an important role in the team's performance outside the subcontinent
 aswin ne kaha, 'behatar gendbaaj banane ke liye mujhe aisa karne kii jarurat he
 i believe it is destiny because till then i had played 18 Test matches and in very few of them i had a bad performance
 jab aap videsh jate ho to yadi prayek apni bhoomika acchhee tarah se nibhaataa he to spinner kii bhoomika kaaphi aasaan ho jaati he
 i should take more and more responsibility
 main bhi puraane diggajon kii barabari karnaa chahta hum
 i would be happy if i win India more matches

 To a large extent, Virat is also like that and i like his attitude because we both do our work in very different ways
 vah bahut aakraamak he or aage rahanaa chahta he
 i am not totally like that but still i want to be in the lead role
 yadi vah ballebaaj ke rup main bharat ke liye aisa kar rahaa he to main chahta hum ki main gendbaaj ke rup main bharat ke liye aisa karun
 We both have one thing in common that we want to constantly improve and do not want to blossom in praise
 main vastav main uske is gun se kaaphi prabhavit hum jiske bare main meraa maananaa he ki yah sabhi logon main nahin paaya jaataa he
 'captaincy is related to luck when Ashwin was asked if he wishes to become the captain of India? He said, 'if you would have asked me this question two or three years ago, i would have been like a passionate youth
 kai tarah kii vyavsaayik baadhaaen hoti he
 i would not say it is a priority because it is not in my hands
 mujhe ek netritvkarta ke rup main khud par vastav main vishwaas he lekin meraa maananaa he ki netritv aisi cheez he jisaki pahchaan karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Right now i am becoming a better player and better person every day
 yadi aisa hona he to aisa hoga
 i believe it is associated with luck

 karthik aryan ek aagyaakaari bete hai or sarkari naukar hai
 Karthik Aryan gets married to Vedika i

 Bhumi Pednekar, and shortly after the wedding, Karthik Aryan starts living lifeless

 nadi ke kinare rahane vaale takreeban 3000 logon ko surakshit jagahon par pahunchaaya gaya he
 Army personnel are also helping in the relief work
 jeenyu kii purv chaatra or jammu-kashmir piples movement kii netaa shehla rashid phir vivaadon main aa gai hai
 This time, the reason has been the tweet made by Shehla alleging atrocities during the blockade in Kashmir
 unke khilaaf is maamle main supreme court ke ek vakil ne somvaar ko police main shikaayat bhi darj kii
 But a day later, Shehla has said that she is firm on her point and will also submit evidence to the government and the army
 shehla ne saath hi sawaal ke lahaze main kaha ki agar mere aarope sahi sabit hue to kya sena karrwai karegi?shehla ne india today se baatcheet main kaha, ‘ugravad bad jayega
 People are already disappearing, joining terrorist organizations
 anuchhed 370 radd kiye jane se vikaas nahin hoga
 For that we have to take people along
 shehla ne kaha, “mukhya mudda anuchhed 370 hataane kaa he, jis tarah vahaan awaazon ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 In this situation, i have spoken to real people in the valley
 unhone mujhe suraksha balon kii ore se kii ja rahi jyadatiyon ke bare main bataaya
 And these are not the people who spread the rumors
 ye vaastavik kashmiri hai jo coup kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 When Shehla was asked about the evidence regarding her claims, she said, "what if i come up with the evidence
" ye ahm nahin he
 The real thing is that whatever Kashmiris are now saying is being dismissed as baseless
 sena ke paas kya saboot he ki mere aarope jhuthe hai? sena ko nishpaksh jaanch karne dena chahie
 i will testify before him
 unhen saare saboot puri jaankaree ke saath saunp duungi
 But if all this turns out to be true, will the army court the court for all these people? ”shehla said,“ We saw how a major had broken the army's SOP and how it was honored
 isliye meraa saboot zyada myne nahin rakhata
 Army is doing too much ye nayaa nahin he
 Shehla said about the restrictions in the valley, "I know journalists whose cameras were snatched by the police
" kashmiriyon ko kuch bhi record karne se sakriy rup se roka jaataa he
 My cousin has returned from downtown (the old city), he has told me that security forces ransacked their homes
 sarkaar abhi jo kar rahi he wo sanchaar linon ko band karke maanavadhikaron kaa khulaa ulanghan kar rahi he
 'shehla reiterated,' My allegations are based on the real witnesses of the people
 agar sarkaar sanchaar line kholti he to ye sabhi baahar aa jaaenge
 i have no vested interest to speak against the Indian Army
 ahm ye note karnaa he ki kal police main shikaayat ke baad, jaanch special cell ko saunp di gai
 Shehla said that his party has always given priority to the rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits
 shehla ne kaha, “main bhi chaahati hum ki ve waapas aaen
 But how is peace possible under such circumstances
 jahaan sarkaar ko amarnath yatriyon, paryatakon, chaatro se jhooth bolnaa padaa
 If the government is saying that the removal of (article 370) will give Kashmiri Pandits a chance to come back (in the Valley), then who is actually fooling them? And people will not come here because this is the conflict zone
 iske liye hamen logon ko saath lenaa hoga
 Pakistan also feels like this
 kashmir mudde kaa hal nikaala janaa chahie
 Imposed development can never prosper
 har koi shanti chahta he lekin is tarah se nahin
 'will your tweets not promote violence? In response to this question, Shehla said, 'how are my tweets inviting violence
 ghati main in tak logon kii pahunch hi nahin he
 These are actions of the armed forces that are inciting violence
 ham kisi bhi chiz ke liye sach ko chhodane nahin ja rahe
 Let the whole truth be revealed
 or main koi atirikt jaankaree nahin de rahi, ye sab wo he jo kashmiri log pehle se hi jaanate hai
