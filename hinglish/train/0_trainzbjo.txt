 kolkata kii ek adaalat ne hindu pakistan vaale kathith bayaan ko lekar congress saansad shashi tharur ke khilaaf mangalvaar ko giraftaar warrant jari kiya
 Tharoor reportedly said that if the BJP comes to power again, this party will again write the constitution and pave the way for the creation of a Hindu Pakistan
 congress netaa ke is kathith bayaan se vivaad paidaa ho gaya tha or bhagava party ne maang kii thi ki tharur is bayaan ke liye maafee maange
 Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Dipanjan Sen issued a bailable warrant against Tharoor on a plea by advocate Sumit Chaudhary
 is maamle par agali sunwaayee 24 sitambar ko hogi
 Chaudhary filed a case in the CMM court here in view of the alleged statement made by Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram
 iske baad congress netaa shashi tharur (shashi Tharoor) umr abdulla (omar Abdullah) ke samarthan main aae or kaha tha ki aap akele nahin hai

 If we isolate them then who is left? sachin ke ek fain jisaki dili hasarat thi ki sachin chakke ke saath hi centuri puraa karen
 The one who had instructed Sachin himself, the only way to escape from nervous nerves is to hit a six
 aap sonch rahe honge ki aakhir koun he sachin kaa aisa fain jo cricket ke bhagwaan ko hi naseehat detaa he? sachin kaa vah kattar fain he unka betaa arjuna
 In the 2007 Mohali ODI against Pakistan, when Sachin was a victim of nervous nerve, Arjun advised him that the dad should have hit you for six
 2007 kaa yah vah daur tha jab sachin lagaataar shatak se chook rahe the
 Many cricket pundits were predicting his cricket career to end
 shaayad papa kii is naakaami se arjuna bhi pareshaan tha isliye vah chahta tha ki sachin ek-do ran lekar shatak puraa karne kii bajaae sidhe chakka maar den
 It is also worth noting here that Sachin was out for 98 in the Mohali Test
 aise main bangalore main jab sachin 99 par the to bete kii naseehat jarur unke man main daud rahi hogi or phir sachin ne vahi kiya jo arjuna kii hasarat thi, thok diya chakka puraa hua shatak
 Arjun becomes happy and happy in the country sachin kii tarah arjuna ne bhi balla uthaa liya he
 Junior Tendulkar also wants to be a cricketer, following the footsteps of his father
 haalanki arjuna apane pehle schuli match main koi karishma to nahin dikhaa paae, lekin cricket ke prati unki deewangi bataati he ki aane vaale dinon main wo pita ke uttaradhikari ho sakate hai
 Sachin also realizes this quality of his son
 tabhi to jab bhi mauka miltaa he wo bete ko cricket kii baarikiyaan sikhaane main jute jate hai
 Sachin is often seen playing cricket with his son
 haalanki, wo apni ummiido kaa bhaar arjuna par thopanaa nahin chaahate
 They have already made it clear that they wish that their son Arjun should decide his own destination
 agar arjuna cricket main pita kii tarah hi pratibhashali nikle to cricket premiyon maidan main ek nayab muqabla dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 The question arises, is it possible? So let us tell you that Arjun's age is 10 years
 agar wo 16 saal main antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan karte hai to us vakt sachin kii umr hogi 43 saal
 It may seem like a dream to many, but it is not impossible given the way Sachin is batting at the age of 37

 The first Monday of the last month of the last year of the decade calls for a special kind of # mondaymotivation
 Choosing to stay fit and encouraging my loved ones to do the same is the best gift one can give
 Once we cross a certain age, we tend to stop giving our body the kind of mobility it needs to stay agile and strong
 This fitness routine 'looks' quite simple, but it gets the job done and HOW! It's great for your knees, legs and glutes; and works on boosting your body's endurance, strength and flexibility
 You can start with 5 rounds, gradually increasing the number
 Simple movement but get results

 From Zumba To Belly Dance: To lose weight, try these five types of dance I've suffered from muscle spasms and back stiffness very often in the past
 When i started Yoga, i was skeptical about performing a lot of the complex asanas
 Being able to flex and stretch the way i can today has been a very steady and gradual process made possible by two things: Yoga and my will-power
 Today, i can easily move my back while practicing asanas like the # catcamel pose
 It's a very easy asana, but it helps improve the spine's flexibility, strengthens the wrist and the shoulder, helps relax and calm the mind
 Enough motivation to start the week on an energetic note

 Even today, girls are walking shoulder to shoulder with boys
 lekin is daur main bhi ladakiyon ko daftaron main kuch kaaman dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 These things not only create obstacles in the way girls work
 balki ye bateladakiyon ke confidence kobhi neeche giraati hai
 Know about 7 things that girls face in the office
 1
 Good relations with the boss means loose character: In most offices, if a female employee talks to her boss well, it is believed that her character is not good
 lekin agar yahi rishte purush ke bos ke saath rahen to ise purushon kaa milansaar hona qaraar diya jaataa he
 2
 saavdhaan! ladke aapako ghur rahe hai:ladke khud to pant qamar se itnaa neeche pahante hai lekin agar koi ladki jeens yaa top thodaa sa neeche yaa upar kii taraf se pahan le or ant:vastron kii patali si pattee bhi dikh jaae to offis ke ladke aise dekhenge ki jaise unhen angrejon dwaara churaakar le gaye kohinoor heere ke milane kii sambhaavna najar aa rahi ho
 3
 jamaana thik nahin he:ladkiyaan offis kii taraf se der raat hone vaali partiyon yaa outing main nahin ja saktin
 Because the so called scholars of the society believe that it is not right to set the age
 apane tark ko majbootee dene ke liye haal hi main rape or chhedhkhani kii ghatnaon ko ginava diya jaataa he
 4
 physical apiyarence:man ho yaa na ho
 Health is bad even if it is good
 offis main ladakiyon se hameshaa yahi ummid kii jaati he ki wo dikhne main chaukas lagen
 On the day of this affair, the girls have to do upper lips, eyebrows maintenance
 haalanki zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko sundar dikhnaa hi acha lagata he lekin kai baar ye uljhan kii vajah bhi ban jaati he
 5
 he bhagwaan, gaali detii he:purush bos agar gaali de yaa dude style main chillaaye, to usko saat khun bhi maaf
 But if a female boss says something in abusive or dude style, then that female boss will be stared as if she had brought a truck and dumped garbage out of Modi's house on the very first day of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 ladkiyaan agar offis main cigarette bhi pi len, to unhen aise dekha jayega jaise fouran unhen cancer hone kaa khatra ho
 6
 samajha karo, tum ghar kii malkin ho:pati or patni yaa bhai or bahan
 Women work, but if a guest arrives at the house or falls out of work, then the responsibility of taking leave from office falls on the female of the house
 tark diya jaataa he ki tum ghar kii malkin ho
 You are beautiful 7
 Delicate girls: Girls are not given any hard work in offices
 isi ke chalate ladakiyon kii lambii shift nahin lagaai jaati
 Even if the boss or office colleagues vent their anger in a packed office, but in the end they will say that hey girl, that's why he is not scolded
 haalanki daant sunanaa kisi ko bhi nahin pasand hota he

 Another senior state leader said, 'maharashtra unit is already scared of' Delhi gang 'of so-called' AAP 'leaders

 sunni vakf board ke vakil or congress netaa kapil sibbal ne court main daleel di ki sunwaayee 2019 tak taal di jaae
 After which the BJP has directly attacked the Congress on this issue
 khud bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne sidhe rahul gandhi se poocha he ki ram mandir ko lekar aapaki party or aapkaa kya stand he? ram mandir ke mudde par press conference karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki bijepi chaahati he ki jald se is mudde par supreme court main sunwaayee ho or faisla aae
 So that a grand temple of Lord Shri Ram can be built in Ayodhya, which is associated with the faith of the country
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki aakhirkaar ram mandir maamle kii sunwaayee rokane se kya hasil hone vaala he
 He said that the Congress party should clarify its stand on the hearing of Ram temple case
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf rahul gandhi gujarat main mandir ja rahe hai, to duusari taraf ram janmabhumi cese par sunwaayee ko taalane ke liye kapil sibbal kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress Party should make its stand clear
 unhone kaha ki kapil sibbal ne court main jo daleel di wo behad hairaan karne vaali he
 After all, what does the election have to do with the Sunni Waqf Board? It is known that on Tuesday, the Supreme Court held a hearing on the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute
 is dauraan sabhi pakshon ke vakeelon ne apane tark rakhe
 Now the next hearing of this case will be on 8 February 2018
 shah ne kaha ki ascharyajanak daleel congress ke netaa or ol india sunni vakf board ke vakil kapil sibbal ne sarvocch adaalat ke saamne rakhi ki july 2019 tak yani jab tak aagaamee lok sabha chunaav sampann nahin ho jate, tab tak is cese kii sunwaayee taal deni chahie
 He said that whenever Congress wants to take a different type of stand on a contentious issue, then Kapil advances Sibal
 shah ne kaha ki jab 2ji ghotaalaa hua tab bhi jiro los kii theory lekar kapil sibbal aage aae the, gujarat main jab aarakshan kaa masalaa aayaa tab bhi 50% se zyada aarakshan sambhav he, aisa ek opinian lekar kapil sibbal aae or ab jab congress ko ram janmabhumi cese ke raste main rode atakane hai, tab bhi kapil sibbal congress party kii ore se sunni vakf board ke vakil ke rup main aae hai
 After all, what did Kapil Sibal say in the Supreme Court? While appearing for the Sunni Waqf Board, Kapil Sibal argued that the hearing should be postponed till July 2019, as the matter has become political
 kapil sibbal or rajeev dhawan kii ore se court main daleel di gai ki is maamle kii jald sunwaayee subramanyam swami kii apil ke baad shuru hui, jo ki is maamle main koi party bhi nahin hai
 Sibal said that the court should not send a wrong message to the country, but should hear the case with a large bench
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan bijepi ke 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main shaamil he, court ko bijepi ke jaal main nahin funsana chahie
 Kapil Sibal told the court that the atmosphere of the country is not yet such that the case can be heard properly
 kyon is masale ko lekar hadabadi main sunwaayee ho rahi he
 Kapil Sibal, on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board, has demanded that 5 or 7 judges' bench should hear the case after the 2019 general election
 kyonki maamla raajnneetik ho chukaa he
 Kapil Sibal and Rajiv Dhawan have objected to this, saying to boycott the hearing

 Sunanda Pushkar
 yani, ek bold, khubasurat, bijanas viman jo jab tak jivit raheen, charchaaon ke centre main raheen
 His death has also turned into a discussion, the end of which does not seem possible at the moment
 aaj kii hi khabar he ki sunanda pushkar ke maamle main police ne ab hatya kaa maamla darj kar liya he
 That is, now the investigation will be under murder case
 ab tak atakalein thim ki pati shashi tharur se kalah ke chalate unhone khud hi dawaaon kaa overdoj le liya tha or khudakushi kar lee thi
 The death of a controversial life is also often controversial
 khaastaur se tab jab yah maut kisi vivaadaaspad mahila kii ho
 Even when the death of a controversial leader's wife
 sunanda ke pati congress netaa or purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur hai jo khud bhi apane bayanon ke chalate vivaadon main rahete rahe hai
 Sunanda was one of the few bold-bold business women who had the ability to express her impeccable views on socio-political issues
 unhen daraana yaa dhamkaana aasaan nahin tha or ve apane faisle apane man mutabik leti dekhi gayi thim
 Shashi met Tharoor at a party in 2009 and married Tharoor in 2010
 tharur or sunanda donon kii yah teesri shaadi thi
 After Sunanda's death, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had said about Sunanda's death that it was a murder
 swami aksar twit ke madhyam se khulaase-se karte rahe hai
 On this matter, he also tweeted and said that Sunanda had severe injuries in many places, from the stomach to the upper body
 unki naak ko dabaakar munh kholaa gaya tha or uske baad jehar daalaa gaya tha
 According to media reports, Swamy had also claimed that he can also provide evidence in this regard
 kya unhonen ye saboot police ko die?
 
 
 Right only to make fun of women, but it is said that women who have beauty do not have brains
 sunanda pushkar aise logon ke gaal par ek karaara tamaacha thim
 But at the same time she was also a big irritant for this social fabric of patriarchal domination
 desh ke haalia pradhanmantri narendra modi jab piem nahin the or himachal pradesh main chunavi jeet ansor karne ke liye raily kar rahe the, tab unhone hi sunanda ko tharur kii '50 karod kii garlfriend' kaha tha
 This statement was severely criticized
 haalanki ek samay tha jab sunanda ne piem modi ke pradhanmantri pad par daavedaari ke paksh main apane vichaar rakhe the
 She herself was from Sopore district of Kashmir
 unhone jammu-kashmir ko special rajya kaa darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ke bare main kaha tha ki isaki samiksha kii jaani chahie
 Today when Modi is the PM and the BJP is in power, she would have been vocal about this once again
 apane man kii bolne vaaleen sunanda maut se chand hafte pehle hi pakistani patrkaar meher taraar par twitor par baraseen thim
 He accused Tarar of trying to create a rift in their married life
 hataasha or gusse main vah taraar ko iesai agent tak kah gai thim
 The mystery of the death of Sunanda, the mistress of Belous personality, who is daring to expose her personal life like this, is still waiting to be unmasked
 ek cilabrity netaa kii patni kii maut kaa rahasy kya kabhi saamne aa paaegaa yaa vakt kii paraton main kahin dabakar khud hi mar jayega? pataa nahin
 
 
 Sunanda has now become a case
 pehle khudakushi samajhe ja rahe is cese par ab is angel se jaanch honi he ki yah hatya thi or ise kyon or kaise anjaam diya gaya
 
 
 i have full faith in law and order
 isiilie, mujhe vishwaas he jaanch tempard yaa manipulate nahin hogi
 However, under the guise of this belief, the shadow of doubt has been seen

 Surprisingly, as soon as Umesh Pandey reached the police station, he was welcomed by garland of notes

 He did not resist it at all

 At the same time, DGP, who reached Meerut for a review meeting with the SSP of 9 districts, also said today that the police officers should keep their conduct right
 saath hi unhone kaha ki SHO thane ko apni jaagir naa samajhen
 Let me tell you that the crime graph has increased very fast in the Isolani area adjacent to Delhi
 loni ilaake main aae din lut, chori, dakaiti, apharan, jhapatmari kii vaaradaaten lagaataar saamne aati rahati hai
 The police has also proved to be unsuccessful in curbing the increasing crime day by day in the area
 aise main kya loni thane ke nae incharge noton kaa haar sweekaar kar kya sandesh dena chaahate hai
 Do they want to tell that keep on committing crimes and keep offering the police like this
 haalanki bataaya ja rahaa he ki thana incharge ke swaagat ke liye yah noton kaa haar sthaneey netaa laae the
 In such a situation, the question arises again whether the other police officers posted at the police station knew who brought the garland of notes
 agar pataa tha to unhone un netaaon ke is ajeeb uphaar ko kaise sweekaar kar liya
 Does it portray the true image of the police
 kya loni police yah sandesh dena chaah rahi he ki police uskaa kaam tatparta se karegi jo use rupayon kaa uphaar chadhayenge
 Is she trying to tell that she will continue to smile in this way towards the people of rupees
 vastav main loni thane kii yah tasviren hairaan kar detii hai
 Both the police department and the garland of notes inside the police department and wearing the garland of notes are wrong from the Police Code and these pictures are giving very wrong message to the people

 magar badhata vajan uski sudanrata ko kam kar detaa he
 And this not only increases weight, but also brings many diseases
 khaskar badhate vajan se pregnancy or uske baad delivery main bhi bahut si dikkatein ho jaati hai
 One example of this is Robin Rees from Durham
 23 saal kii umr main jab robin ne shaadi kii tab unka vajan takreeban 96 kilo tha
 Robin is very fond of walking and eating, which causes him to gain a lot of weight
 jab robin ne apane pati ke saath ai
 V
 epa takanic ke jariye parivaar badhaane kaa faisla kiya to doctor ne unhe bataaya ki iske liye unka vajan bahut zyada he
 When she came to know that she would not be able to become a mother with this weight, she decided that now she will continue to lose weight
 robin ne kareeb 36 kilo vajan kam kiya he
 Robin has over 30,000 followers on Instagram who have seen Robin's photo and his journey
 robin kii maane to unhen khaane pine kaa behad shauk he vah chips, kold-drink, pizza, french-friese bahut khaati thi
 But since she has lost weight, she avoids all these things
 ab wo apane khaane pine kaa bahut khyaal rakhti hai lekin sabase acchhee baat ye he ki ab wo family plan karne ke liye bhi puri tarah feet hai
 How did this happen? Robin explains that she was never a slim girl
 motaape kii vajah se log aksar unhen chidhaate the
 During school days, she often came home crying
 baavjood iske unhone kabhi bhi apane khaane-pine or ghoomane-phirane main katautee nahin kii
 Like Robin, her husband is also fond of traveling and eating
 lekin is kapal ko jhatka tab laga, jab doctor ne unhen bataaya ki robin ko maa banane ke liye ivief takanic kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 But she was also unfit for IVF
 usee din unhone ye tay kar liya ki wo us samay tak kahin ghoomane nahin jaaengi, jab tak apana vajan kam na kar len
 The good thing is that Robin did not resort to any kind of surgery
 na hi dieting kii, sirf apni diet main badlaav kiya
 Reduced your daily calorie intake
 unhone online maujuud fitness ap kaa sahaara liya or apni diet khud tay kii
 Robin took to Instagram to monitor herself
 wo har roj apni photo aplod karatin or dekhti ki unamem kuch antar aayaa he yaa nahin
 Days passed and the difference started
 is dauraan instagram par unase bahut se log jude jinhone unka manobal badhaayaa
 This was Robin's earlier and later diet: - Whereas before Robin did not take breakfast, now she takes half boiled eggs in breakfast
 uske saath hi smoked salmon machhlee bhi
 - Earlier she used to like to eat burgers, chips or hot dogs in the afternoon and now take low calorie soup
 -dinar ke samay cheez se bharpoor chijen or ab grield chikan yaa phir sweet potato

 In the year 2006 also, the Gurjar movement was in the headlines
 2007 main bhi chale andolan main 23 march ko police karrwai main 26 log maare gaye the
 In 2008, this movement started again
 dausa se bharatpur tak patariyon or sadakon par baithe gurjaron ne rasta roke rakhaa
 Police action killed 38 people in those days
 darasal har do-ek saal par rajasthan ke kuch ilaakon se gurjar andolan kii khabar aati he or dilli mumbai kaa rasta ruk jaataa he
 The question is, what do these Gujjars want and what is their movement
 - desh bhar main uttar-pashchimi bharat ke kai rajyon main gurjar samudaay ke qareeb saadhe paanch karod log hai
 - 11% of them, i
e
 around 6 lakh people are in Rajasthan
 - jammu-kashmir or himachal pradesh main inhen anusuchit janajati, yani adivaasiyon kaa darja hasil he
 - Whereas in Rajasthan they come to the OBC and thus they get the benefits of reservation
 lekin gurjar samudaay ko lagata rahaa he ki un tak pichhadaa varg ke laabh pahunch nahin paa rahe
 They demand that they be included among the tribals
 haalanki is maang ke kilaaf rajya kaa meena samudaay bhi andolan kar chukaa he jise lagata he ki agar gurjaron ko adivasee maan liya gaya to unke haq maare jaaenge
 The comments sarkarein gurjaron kii maang maanati rahi hai lekin adaalaton se faisale kaarij hote rahe hai
 In the 2003 assembly elections, BJP promised ST status to the Gurjars
 - 2008 main vasundhara sarkaar ne gurjaron ko vishesh pichhadaa varg kaa darja dete hue 5 fisadi aarakshan dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 Also declared 14% reservation for economically weaker people
 - lekin rajasthan hycourt ne antarim aadesh main ise radd kar diya, ye kehete hue ki isse kul aarakshan 68 fisadi ho jaataa he jo supreme court ke faisale ke kilaaf he
 - In 2012, the state government talked about giving 5 percent reservation to five castes including Gurjars
 - lekin 2013 main hycourt ne ise bhi ye kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki phir aarakshan 54 fisadi ho jaataa he
 Now Gurjar leaders say, even if tribal status is not available now, they need five percent reservation within the prescribed limit of fifty percent
 unki shikaayat ye bhi he ki sarkaar jaaton par to meharbaan he, un par nahin
 In fact, every two years, there is news of Gurjar agitation from some areas of Rajasthan and the road to Delhi Mumbai stops
 sawaal he, kya chaahate hai ye gurjar or kya he inkaa andolan
 There are about five and a half crore people of Gurjar community in many states of northwestern India across the country
 - inamen 11 fisadi, yani qareeb 6 lakh log rajasthan main hai
 - In Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh , they have the status of Scheduled Tribes, ie tribals
 - jabaki rajasthan main wo obisi main aate hai or is taur par unhen aarakshan ke faayde milte hai
 But the Gurjar community has felt that the benefits of backward classes are not reaching them
 unki maang he ki unhen adivaasiyon main shaamil kiya jaae
 However, the Meena community of the state has also agitated against this demand, which feels that if the Gurjars are considered as adivasis, their rights will be killed
 tippaniyan Governments have been accepting the demand of Gujjars, but the judgments from the courts have been dismissed
 - 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne gurjaron ko asti states dene kaa vaada kiya
 In 2008, Vasundhara government announced 5 percent reservation giving special backward class status to Gurjars
 saath hi 14 fisadi aarakshan aarthik taur par kamazor logon ke liye ghoshit kiya
 - But the Rajasthan High Court quashed it in an interim order, saying that this brings the total reservation to 68 percent, which is against the Supreme Court's decision
 - 2012 main rajya sarkaar ne gurjaron sahit paanch jatiyon ko 5 fisadi kaa reserveshan dene kii baat kii
 - But in 2013, the High Court also rejected this saying that the reservation then becomes 54%
 ab gurjar netaaon kaa kahana he, ab adivasee darja bhale na mili, unhen pachaas fisadi kii tay seemaa ke bheetar hi paanch fisadi aarakshan chahie
 Their complaint is also that the government is kind to Jats and not to them

 When Rahul Gandhi went on holiday in the middle of the budget session, from the political corridor to social media, discussion started about where Rahul Gandhi has gone

 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said that Rahul Gandhi is spending holidays in Uttarakhand, not abroad
 jagadish sharma ne twitor par teen tasviren post karte hue likhaa, "rahul gandhi hameshaa uttarakhand kii pahadiyon par jate hai, bacock nahin
 "in one picture, Rahul Gandhi is seen talking on the phone wearing a sweater and cap
 haalanki rahul ke daftar ne jor dekar kaha ki vah videsh gaye hai or ye tasviren pehle kii hai
 Congress leader Rajiv Shukla has said, if he (rahul Gandhi) wants to take a break and want to self-destruct, let him do it
 aap kahin se tasviren le lete hai or soshal media par daal dete hai
 This is ridiculous
 wo dusron ko to maut detaa he par khud kii maut ko chhalaava bana kar rakhaa hua he
 On Tuesday, news came again that the world's largest terrorist and ISIS Supreme Commander Abubakar Al Baghdadi was killed in an air strike
 lekin bagdadi kii maut kii khabar kii pushti karne ke liye na to iraq or syria main america kii aguai main lard rahi gathbandh sena saamne ai na hi koi or desh
 By the way, let me tell you that this is the fourth death of Baghdadi in the last two years
 uttari syria ke shahar rakka ke ek bade hisse par iesas kaa kabja he
 On the evening of 9 June, the us-led coalition forces reported that ISIS leader Abubkar al-baghdadi was on his way to Syria from Raqqa hiding in a convoy of cars along with some other big commanders
 rakka main aies kii ek ahm meeting hone vaali thi
 Baghdadi's death in the air strike is not confirmed as soon as the news is received, the coalition forces are immediately alerted
 satellite kii madad se rakka kii tasviren hasil kii jaati hai
 And then as soon as the news of the informer is confirmed, the bomb is dropped from the sky at the place where the convoy of Baghdadi's cars was said to have passed
 nishaanaa sateek tha
 In the attack, several cars are simultaneously targeted
 magar hamalaa aasmaan se hua tha or jis jagah par hamalaa hua vahaan jameen par koi fouj nahin thi
 That is, after the attack, there was no one to see who were the people in the cars that were targeted
 unamem koun-koun maare gaye or koun-koun batch gaya?isis ke sargana ne todaa damahamale ke teen din baad achaanak khabar aati he ki 9 june ke hawaii hamale main iesas kaa sabase bada sargana yani bagdadi maaraa gaya
 This news comes not from anywhere else but from isis-linked news agency al-amaq
 agency ne daawa kiya ki hawaii hamale ke baad ravivaar ko jakhmi bagdadi ne dam tod diya
 Some claim to have been injured, after al-amaq's claim on Monday, Iran and Turkish media also claim Baghdadi's death
 yahaan tak ki iraqi media bhi pehali baar somvaar ko hawaii hamale kii pushti karti he
 But Iraqi media say that Baghdadi was injured and not killed in the attack
 iraqi samachar channel al sumaria tivi ne iraq ke ninaveh praant ke sthaneey sutron ke hawaale se kaha he kii bagdadi or uske kuch saathi guuruuvaar ko gathbandhan kii bambaari main ghayal ho gaye hai
 The place where the attack took place is close to the border of Iraq and Syria and 65 kilometers west of Nineveh
 maut kii khabar kitni sach kitni jhutheb sawaal ye he ki aise main khud iesas kii news agency apane sargana ke maare jane kaa daawa kyon kar rahi he? jabaki iraq samet khud america kii aguai vaali gathjod sena tak is mudde par puri tarah khamosh he
 Even the American and British media are silent on the death of Baghdadi
 ab sawaal ye he ki duniya kaa sabase khaufnak aatankwaadi, saikadon begunaahon kaa kaatil, sabase vahashiana maut baantne vaala shaks, insaaniyat kaa sabase bada dushman, america samet kai deshon kaa most wonted
 Is Bakr al Baghdadi, the biggest prize-maker of 175 crores, the chief of ISIS and the Khalifa of Islamic State militants, has been killed or is this a stash of his death? News of the death has come so many times before on the death of Baghdadi Can not be easily believed as this is his fourth death in the last two years
 jo kal tak apni sanak kii badaulat puri duniya main maut baantta gum rahaa tha, begunaahon ke sir kalam kar rahaa tha, vahi bagdadi khud maaraa jaae to jaahir he harek kaa chaunkna or maut kaa puraa sach jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 But this is not the first time with Baghdadi
 2014 se 2015 ke bich bhi wo teen baar mar chukaa tha, magar phir har baar uske jinda hone kaa saboot saamne aa jaataa
 This is the fourth death in two years of the most dreaded terrorist and ISIS Chief, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi of the world, who caused a worldwide death and panic in the name of the establishment of Islamic rule in 2014
 6 sitambar 2014 ko bagdadi kii pehali maut hui thi
 This was the time when Baghdadi showed a picture of a British journalist cutting his throat on the camera and showing it to the whole world
 tab pehali baar iesas kaa jaalim cheharaa jamaane ne dekha tha
 After this, there was news of Baghdadi being first injured and then dead in an air strike
 magar is khabar ke saamne aane ke kareeb maheene bhar baad 13 november 2014 ko bagdadi kaa audio saamne aa gaya or usne khud kii maut ko jhuthla diya
 27 April 2015 Baghdadi's second death About six months after the first death, news of Baghdadi's second death came from the Golan Heights area of syria
 is baar bhi bagdadi ke pehle gathjod sena ke hawaii hamale main ghayal hone kii khabar ai
 Radio Iran then claimed that Baghdadi died in an Israeli hospital in the Golan Heights area of syria on April 27, about a month after he was injured
 radio iran ke alaava do iraqi news agenciyon algaad press or al-yum al-tamen kaa bhi yahi daawa tha
 But about three months later, in July 2015, evidence of Baghdadi being alive again surfaced
 jab teesri baar mara maut kaa saudagar12 akbur 2015 ko teesri baar bagdadi kii maut kii khabar mili
 The news came that Baghdadi was badly injured in an airstrike launched by the us-led army against ISIS
 daawa kiya gaya ki hamale ke vakt bagdadi apane kuch saathiyon ke saath iraq or syria border ke najadik ek gumnaam thikaane par ja rahaa tha
 This time the British newspaper Guardian confirmed this news for the first time
 report main daawa kiya gaya tha ki iesas ke ek kafile par hue is hawaii hamale main bagdadi jahaan jakhmi hua tha, vahiin uske teen saathi maare gaye the
 And this attack happened while Baghdadi was passing through the Al Baz area of iraq
 iraq kaa ye ilaaka syria border se sata hua he
 Then the news of false death came out
 Within a month, the news of this third death of Baghdadi also came out false
 or ab bagdadi kii chauthi maut kii khabar aa gai he
 Now to see when Baghdadi comes to give evidence of his death or his being alive? How ISIS flourished? These are the fake acts of Baghdadi and its terrorist organization ISIS that hardly a day passes when ISIS is not mentioned Happen par sawaal ye he ki aakhir ye IS yaa ISIS he kya? kahaan se aayaa, kyon aayaa, kiski vajah se aayaa or ise koun laayaa? to aaie ab jaanate hai bagdadi or uske ISIS ke janm se lekar ise janm dene vaale or phir use paalane-posane vaale tamaam logon ke bare main
 After a long battle, the US had liberated Iraq from the clutches of Saddam Hussein
 par is aazaadee ko hasil karne ke dauraan iraq puri tarah barbaad ho chukaa tha or usee barbaad iraq se 2011 tak america apni sari sena ko waapas bula letaa he
 Many small groups now start fighting for their strength as Baghdadi American military leaves Iraq
 unheen main se ek gut kaa netaa tha abu bakar al bagdadi
 al-qaeda Chief of Iraq
 wo 2006 se hi iraq main apni jameen taiyaar karne main laga tha
 But then he had no money, no help nor fighters
 bagdadi chunki khud sthaneey tha jaisaa ki uske naam se pataa chalata he lihaaja videshiyon ke iraq chhodte hi usne iraq main apni jaden nae sire se jamaane kaa faisla kiya
 Iraq was ruined, in fact, by the time the US Army returned from Iraq in 2011, it had destroyed the Iraqi government
 saddaam maaraa ja chukaa tha
 Infrastructure was completely devastated and the biggest thing was that he left the power walkroom in Iraq
 magar sansadhano kii kami ke chalate tab bagaddi zyada kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 However, to re-occupy Iraq, by then it had renamed al-qaeda Iraq as the new ISI
 yani islamic state of iraq
 Baghdadi added thousands of people, Baghdadi had united the commanders and soldiers of Saddam Hussein's army
 iske baad usne shuruaati nishaanaa police, military daftar, check points or recrureating steshans ko bananaa shuru kiya
 By now thousands of people had joined with Baghdadi, but Baghdadi was not getting that success in Iraq
 syria tak banane chalaa pahunchairaq se maayoos hokar ab bagdadi ne syria kaa rukh karne kaa faisla kiya
 Syria was experiencing civil war then
 al-kaayda or free sirian army vahaan ke do sabase bade gut the jo syrian raashtrapati se morcha le rahe the
 But even in Syria for the first four years Baghdadi did not get any major success
 alabatta is dauraan usne ek baar phir se apane sanghathan kaa naam badal kar ab iesas kar diya tha
 Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
 ISIS ke haath lage gola-baruhub iesas kaa beej pad chukaa tha lekin abhi is jahrile paudhe ko khaad pani milanaa baaki tha or wo mila america, isroyal, jordan, turki or saudi arab jaise mulkon kii galati se
 In fact, the ammunition that these countries had sent for the Free Syrian Army, got caught in the hands of ISIS and it was from here that the days of these terrorists overturned
 free sirian army ke general ne pehali baar saamne aakar duniya se apil kii thi ki agar unhen hathiyaar nahin mili to wo baagiyon se apni jang ek maheene ke andar haar jaaenge
 Training for terrorists Within a week of this appeal, the United States, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar started providing arms, money, and training to the Free Syrian Army
 in deshon ne baqayada saare aadhunik hathiyaar, anti tanks missile, gola-barood sab kuch syria pahunchaa diya or bas yaheen se iesas ke din palat gaye
 Actually, the weapons which were meant for the Free Syrian Army, they reached ISIS within a year because by then IS had broken into the Free Syrian Army and many of its people had joined them
 saath hi syria main freedom fiter kaa nakaab pahan kar bhi aies ne duniya ko dhokhaa diya isi nakaab kii aadaa main khud america tak ne anjaane main aies ke aatankwaadiyon ko trening de daali
 Unsurprisingly, there was a hoard of weapons from America
 15 hajaar ke kareeb ladaake bhi saath ho liye the
 After this, in June 2014, for the first time such a picture of IS suddenly appears in front of the world, and an anonymous organization becomes the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world in the next few months
 yani sach yahi he ki iesas ke janm ke peeche jane-anjaane america kaa hi haath rahaa
 Just as Osama bin Laden and al-qaeda were born with the help of America
 thik vaise hi jaise 1980 main iran ke khilaaf istemaal ke liye chemical hathiyaar dekar america ne saddaam ko saddan hossain banaaya
 Similarly, the US gave arms and training to the Freedom Fighter of Syria and now the same Freedom Fighter is fighting under the banner of ISIS

 uttar pradesh kii 403 vidhansabha sito ke liye ho rahe chunaav main samaajawaadee party or congress ke bich bhale hi gathbandhan ho, lekin kuch aisi siten bhi he jahaan donon partiyaan aamane-saamne hai
 Amethi seat is also one of them, where both Congress and Samajwadi Party have fielded their candidates
 jahaan congress ne amethi ko apni paramparaagat seat hone kaa daawa karte hue amita singh ko chunaav maidan main utaara he to vahiin samaajawaadee party ne apane seating emele gayatri prajapati ko tikat diya he
 Gayatri Prajapati is considered to be very close to SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav
 haal hi main supreme court ne unke khilaaf gangrape kaa maamla darj karaane kaa nirdesh diya
 The comments 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main gayatri prajapati pehali baar samaajawaadee party ke tikat par amethi se chunaav lade or congress kii amita singh ko haraakar vidhansabha pahunche
 Only after this victory, Gayatri Prajapati went ahead and never looked back in politics
 congress ke garh amethi main amita singh ko haraane ke baad gayatri prajapati mulaayam singh ke kaaphi karibiyon main shaamil ho gaye or akhilesh sarkaar main mantri banaae gaye
 In 2012, Gayatri Prajapati was given the responsibility of Irrigation Department, besides being given independent charge of the Ministry of Mining
 iske baad 2014 main samaajawaadee party ne pichhadi jatiyon ko lubhaane ke liye gayatri prajapati ko cabinet mantri kaa darja de diya
 Gayatri Prajapati grew in stature after becoming a minister in UP, but with him the list of controversies also grew longer
 2015 main ipies amitabh thakur ne gayatri prajapati ke khilaaf abhiyaan ched diya or unke khilaaf lokayukta ke paas teen maamle darj karaae gaye
 Gayatri Prajapati was accused of amassing disproportionate assets through illegal mining, but the case was closed due to lack of evidence
 iske baad 2016 main elahabaad hai court ne sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dete hue yah pataa lagane ko kaha ki avaidh khanan hua he yaa nahin
 After which Akhilesh Yadav expelled Gayatri Prajapati from the cabinet
 haalanki mulaayam singh ke hastkshep ke baad unhen phir se cabinet main waapas le liya gaya
 In the 2012 assembly elections, Gayatri Prajapati contested from Amethi on the Samajwadi Party ticket for the first time and defeated Amita Singh of Congress and reached the assembly
 is jeet ke baad hi gayatri prajapati aage badhate gaye or raajnneeti main kabhi bhi pichhe mudakar nahin dekha

 To win the trust of investors, Global Auto Cab had also issued an advertisement to bring a news channel, but nothing other than the cab is visible in the name of the news channel
 madhya dilli ke ek chor par yamuna ke pashchimi kinare se lage dilli sachivalay ke ek ore inakam tex ke daftar hai to duusari ore rajghat par mahatma gandhi kaa smarak he
 This mile-long gap marks two parts of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's life - one as an income tax officer in his former workplace and the other as his inspiration or agitational inspiration, which apparently comes from Gandhi's principle of swaraj and selfless deeds
 yahaan kejariwal teesri manzil par baithte hai, swaghoshit araajaktaavaadi yaa kisi enjio ke sansthaapak ke taur par nahin, balki tej-tarraar netaa kii tarah
 They have arrived here after winning a landslide in the election, and many other elections are yet to be contested
 yah march ke duusare hafte main somvaar kii ek sard subah he
 It has been almost a month since the government of Delhi came to power
 khud kejariwal bangaluru main hai, jahaan ve apni haai blad sugar or apni mashhoor aam aadmi khaansee kaa nechuropathy main hakrate bhar se ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 But there is tremendous enthusiasm in the offices of his office
 kaagajon se khaali in mejon par, jahaan adhikari apane junior saathiyon ke saath tivi seton se chhanakar aati cricket vishwa cap kii camentry sunate hue dopaharka khaanaa khate hai, telephone lagaataar ghanaghna rahe hai
 Today, no words like DJB (delhi Jal Board supplying water to Delhi) or DVB (delhi Electricity Board providing electricity) are heard in any conversation here, but AK, PB and Vaivai are echoing
 arvind kejariwal, prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav kii tikdi ek samay aam aadmi party (aap) kii ji-jaan hua karti thi
 Formed on the basis of political opposition to fight corruption and VIP culture, this party used its ideology, its organizational strength and its ammunition to expose major corruption from this trio
 ve party sahakarmi hone se zyada bhi kuch hua karte the-ve dost the, hamajoli the or morche par ladane vaale saathi yoddha
 But now with the opening of the front against each other, the arithmetic of the expectations imposed on AAP has gone awry
 dilli chunaav se pehle ke maheenon main ve gupachup ek-duusare kii mukhaalafat kar rahe the or satta main aane ke baad ab khuleam kar rahe hai
 Public statements damaging the party's interests, e-mails of fratricide, media reports, disgusting accusations, sarcasm and denials, clashes over ticket sharing, power disruption, signature campaigns, audio sting And the personality cult - everything you promised to be above, is now bent on wiring its public image
 baantne vaali or jhuthe vaade karne vaali siyasat ke khilaaf ekajute morcha ab hawa ho chukaa he
 India's dismal political reality has also brought you to its level
 bhushan or yadav ko 4 march ko rajnatik maamalon kii samiti (piesi) se hataane ke baad aaj jab unhen party se baahar nikaalane kaa rasta saaf ho chukaa he, tab aam aadmi use kisi bhi duusari party kii tarah dekh or mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Is it a party that is breaking down due to the outpouring of power just a few weeks after winning an unprecedented 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly? Or is it a movement that is being shaped and transformed into a true political institution by erecting a traditional leadership structure around its most popular symbol? This is the question from which the blurred sides of this black-and-white-looking story of collegiality, isolation and arrogance begin to emerge
 dhamaake kaa intjaaraap ke khushhaal ghar main sankat ne 10 maheene pehle 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ke safaaye ke fouran baad hi dastak de di thi
 The party won four seats in Punjab in that election and despite winning its own candidate in 434 seats across the country, it could not win anywhere else
 dilli kii saaton sansadeey siton par karaari haar ke alaava kejariwal ko varanasi main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke haathon joardaar haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 India's top election analyst Yadav, whose internal surveys predicted his own victory, lost to bjp's winning candidate Rao Inderjit Singh, finishing fourth after the Indian National Lok Dal and Congress
 iske baad hui ek ke baad ek aantarik baithkon main matbhed teji se ubharne lage
 These differences were about the hasty decision of the party to expand, so in the Delhi Assembly (where AAP had 28 seats and had run the government for 49 days) there was also the possibility of re-forming the government with the Congress
 dilli main bhushan ke jangpura ilaake main sthit ghar par aisi hi ek baithak main (6-8 june) jab bataur rashtriya sanyojak party ko chalaane kii unki kaabiliyat par sawaal khadey kiye gaye, to kejariwal rone lage
 While giving details of this meeting, Kejriwal's supporter and aap's Delhi convenor in the 2015 assembly elections, Ashutosh, wrote: "they (kejriwal) got up and asked for permission to leave the room
" unhone kuch kahana shuru kiya lekin puraa nahin kar sake
 They wept and fell on the floor with tears flowing regardless
 
 
 kuch samay baad arvind ne khud ko sambhala
 By now every person had gathered around him
 unhone kaha, ''maine apni naukari or jindagi kii tamaam duusari acchhee chijen party kaa sanyojak banane ke liye nahin chodi thim
 i do not want this
 meharbaani karke kisi or ko rashtriya sanyojak chun len
 "and his eyes were filled again
 " jaisaa bataaya jaataa he, arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki ve robert wadra or narendra modi se to lard sakate hai, lekin khud apane logon se bhala kaise lard sakate hai
 It is this sentimentalism that stems from Kejriwal's long association with his comrades, especially the Anna Hazare movement in 2012, long before he was a supporter, and adds a dimension of "human weakness" to this narrative of confrontation
 shuruyaat main jab ve saath aae, tab donon ke bich varchasv kaa palada majbootee se bhushan ke paksh main jhukaa hua tha
 Kejriwal was a former bureaucrat-turned-rti activist, while Bhushan was the top advocate for public interest litigation in India, weighing in on his talk and the steps taken
 darasal, kejariwal ke ubharne or pramukhataa hasil karne main aanshik yogadan bhushan or bauddhik haisiyat rakhane vaale duusare logon kaa bhi rahaa he
 Among them is Yadav, who openly supported and encouraged him
 ab jab rishton main varchasv kaa palada naatakeey rup se kejariwal kii taraf jhuk gaya he, to unke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki bhushan or yadav is badale hue halaat ko pachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 For example, after the June meeting, Kejriwal was retained as the National Convenor, but with the decision not to contest the Haryana Assembly elections, where the ambition to lead the party was in Yadav's mind, an atmosphere of suspicion and intrigues began to develop
 dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya or aap netaaon gopal raay, sanjay singh or pankaj gupta ne 10 march ko party kii website par ek aadhikarik bayaan aplod kiya
 There is also an allegation against Yadav that he tried to tarnish the party's image by projecting news in newspapers and project Kejriwal like a dictator
 akhbaar da hindu kii ek purv patrkaar, jo ab da indian express ke liye kaam karti hai, kii ek khabar se agast 2014 main kam se kam ek aisi hi of-da-record brifing kii jhalak milti he
 Yadav has denied the charge
 prashanth bhushan ke khilaaf partyvirohi gatividhiyon ke aarope varisht party netaaon ko die gaye unke kathith bayanon se shuru hote hai
 These include the talk told to former journalist Ashish Khaitan that he wanted you to lose the election in Delhi
 iske alaava, america main rahane vaali unki bahan shalini gupta ne pravasi bhartiya daandaataaon ko email bhejkar unase kaha ki ve party ko paisa na den; or bhushan ke pita tathaa varisht vakil shanti bhushan ne 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bijepi ummidavaar kiran bedi kaa anumodan karte hue saarvajanik bayaan diya
 Prashant Bhushan's answer to all these things is that "the whole truth in this matter will be revealed soon
" "donon khemon ke bich jhagade kii ek or jad 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main 12 ''daagi" ummidavaaron ko tikat dene kaa maamla bhi he
 Most of these candidates were from outer Delhi regions
 bhushan ne aarope lagaaya tha ki ye bahubali or jameen kabjane vaale log hai or inkaa aap ke saath judsa party kii vichaardhaara or svachh chunavi raajnneeti karne kii niti ke khilaaf he
 Party's Lokpal Admiral L
 ramdaas kii aguai main aap kii aantarik jaanch samiti ne in 12 main se sirf do ke tikat waapas lene kii sifarish kii
 Out of the remaining 10, 9 won the election and reached the assembly
 vispataar vivaddilli kii joardaar or viraat safalataa se utsahit hokar yadav or bhushan tathaa mayank gandhi or anand kumaar sareekhe kuch or netaaon ko laga ki ab ek baar phir party ke akhil bhartiya vistaar ke liye jor daalana chahie
 Some of them are saying that Kejriwal should now follow Delhi by following the principle of "one man one post" and leave the responsibility of overseeing the national ambitions of the party with the state units
 lekin kejariwal hi party ke pramukh chehre hai, lihaaja unke samarthakon ko lagata he ki yah party main ''chanakya-chandragupta model" kaayam karne kii koshish he, jisamen kejariwal kii lokapriyata par savaar hokar yadav or bhushan gaddi ke peeche se satta chalaanaa chaahate hai
 Kejriwal and his camp have not forgotten the 2014 Lok Sabha election debacle, so they feel that the pressure of expansion of the party is either childish or full of conceit
 14 farvari ko ramlila maidan se kejariwal ne dilli kii jeet par apane dhanyavad bhaashan main apni party ko kaaphi der tak ''anhakaar" ke khilaaf chetaya tha or yah vaada kiya tha ki party dilli par or sirf dilli par apana dhyaan kendrit karegi
 As aap's Delhi campaign chief Ashish Talwar points out, Kejriwal's thinking is that in any state the party can enter the election only when it has three things ready
 45 varshiya talwaar purv congressi hai or kaha jaataa he ki party ke kuch vaicharik pravaktaaon ke rajnatik siddhanton ke ulat unke vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke anubhavon ne dilli main jabardast phayda pahunchaaya
 He says, "to get into the election one must first be a trustworthy leader
 duusare, chunaav abhiyaan ke vibhinn pahaluon kii dekharekh kar paane ke liye paryaapt maanav bal sansaadhan yani kaaryakarta hone chahie
 And third, there should be a basic organizational structure at the booth level, which is present for at least 60 per cent of the booths in each constituency
 sirf yah dharna kaaphi nahin he ki hawa aapke paksh main bah rahi he
 "another AAP leader feels that all these three things are fulfilled only in Punjab, where the party already has four mps
 ye netaa kehete hai, ''yadav kheme kii dikkat yah he ki unhone hamaari galatiyon se sabak nahin siikhaa
 They only understand the meaning of expansion to get into the election immediately, while extension also means to make the party stand out from the ground and prepare for future elections
 " yah baarik lekin ahm fark maujuuda satta kii ladaai kaa ek or pahalu he
 However, it is seen from the perspective of the state leaders of AAP, if the party does not contest the elections in that area, then their strength becomes very weak
 yah aap ke dhaanche main unhen haashie kaa khilaadi bana detii he
 Therefore, their discomfort and impatience can be understood
 maharashtra ke ek aap netaa kehete hai, ''agar main apane kaaryakartaaon ko city kvaunicipal chunaav main yaa vidhansabha chunaav main siton kaa vaada nahin kar saktaa, to main party main kar kya rahaa hum? jab mere bhavishya ke faisle dilli main kiye ja rahe hai, tab aisa mahasoos karne main kya galat he ki mujhe darkinar kiya ja rahaa he?"to ek taraf yah bechaini he or duusari taraf anuyaayiyon kii vishaal fouj ke saath apane asli kad se bahut bada ek netaa, jiske haathon main sari satta he
 In such a situation, the roots of skepticism and mistrust have gone deep and no party can claim high moral conduct
 sarvanumati kii jis bhaavana ko party kii buniyaad mana jaataa tha, use yaa to hameshaa ke liye hawa main uda diya gaya he yaa kam se kam kuch samay ke liye puri tarah se taak par rakh diya gaya he, jisase yuddhrat kheme apane matbhed sulajhaa nahin paa rahe hai
 You are standing on the verge where he has to decide where his future is - which path he has to choose and who will be with him in the journey on that path
 kejariwal ko inakam tex ke daftar se sachivalay tak pahunchane main 10 saal lage hai
 No other national option appears on the board
 aise main agle kuch din yah tay karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaayenge ki aap, yaa aap kaa vichaar maatr, agle ek dashak main paanch kilometre kii duuri par sthit raisina hill kaa daavedaar ho saktaa he yaa nahin

 bacchon kii parvarish aasaan nahin hoti
 Especially if the parents are working, then the challenge increases even more
 bacchon ko anushaasit rakhane yaa sudhaarney ke liye ham kai baar unase aisi baaten bol dete hai, jo unke komal man par negative chhap chhod detii he
 Due to which they become more stubborn instead of improving
 unke dimag main wo baaten baith jaatin he
 This can prove to be extremely dangerous
 bacchon main persenelity development ke ishu aa sakate hai
 In such a situation it becomes even more important to know what not to say to the children
 
 
 main bhi padhai main itani hi buree thi / tha:bachche se bhuulakar bhi yah baat naa kahen
 Because of this, children can become careless about studies
 bachche ko kadi mehnat ke liye prerit karen
 Complaint with Papa: Usually in the house the image of the father is made like a disciplined person
 par baar-baar papa ke naam kii dhamkee dekar aap jo bacchon ko anushaasit karne kii koshish karti hai, darasal wo unke man main papa ke liye dar paidaa karata he
 The fear of respect for Papa takes place in his mind
 jis kaaran baccha apane pita se dur ho saktaa he
 Taunting is not always right: Do not taunt children repeatedly
 baar-baar ek hi baat bolne or taana dene se bachche zyada gusse vaale or chidhchidhe ho jate hai
 At the same time, they also start being stubborn
 bacchon main tulana naa karen:kai baar ham apane bacchon main hi naa chaahate hue bhi bhedbhaav darsha dete hai
 Do not compare your child to any other child
 doosraa baccha aapke bete yaa beti se tej he yaa khubasurat he, is tarah kii tulana na karen
 This leads to inferiority complex in children about other children
 motaape kaa ehsaas naa karaaen:aap dit par hai yaa apana vajan ghataana chaahati hai, yahaan tak to thik he
 But do not reveal this to the children
 aisa karne se bachche apane vajan ko lekar chintit ho jate hai or khaanaa thik se nahin khate
 Therefore, do not repeatedly stand on the weight machine in front of them, nor tell them that nowadays you are trying to lose weight

 In the Lok Sabha elections, the people of the country have given a strong majority to the BJP on the name and work of Narendra Modi
 is baar bhi janata ko narendra modi se kaaphi ummid he
 PM Modi has also assured that the development works and reforms started in the first round will be carried forward
 lekin aam chunaav se kuch maheenon pehle se hi desh main arthvyavastha ke morche par nakaaratmak khabaren aane lagi thim
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge before PM Modi will be how to speed up the economy again
 arthvyavastha main susti kaa alam he
 The country's industrial production has declined, inflation has increased and GDP growth rate is expected to be lower than anticipated in this financial year
 aaie jaanate hai ki desh kii arthvyavastha ke morche par or koun-si chunautiyaan hai jinka nai sarkaar ko saamana karnaa he
 Employment rate government 2
 0 ke liye sabase badi chunauti rojgaar main tej badhat karne kii hogi
 The current government had to face a lot of criticism on the employment front
 ipiefo ke mutabik, oktober 2018 se april ant tak ausat masik naukari srijan main 26 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 The pace of job creation is also very slow
 haal main media main li eneseso kii periodic lebar force survey (PLFS) report main kaha gaya tha ki 2017-18 main berogari kii dar 6

 The decline in industrial production and the decline in industrial production is a matter of concern for the government
 udyongon ko arthvyavastha kaa sabase majboot pahiyaa mana jaataa he jinke dam par rojgaar srijan jaisaa jaruri kaary sambhav hota he
 Due to sluggishness in the manufacturing sector, the country's industrial production (IIP) in March this year was 0 compared to the same month last year
 1 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 According to government data, this is the weakest performance for 21 months in industrial production
 puure vitt varsh 2018-19 main audyogic vruddhi dar 3

 The decrease in industrial production means that orders are coming down to industries for the next months i
e
 neither the public is ready to spend nor the government
 arthvyavastha ko gati dena he to audyogic utpaadan ko phir se patari par laana hoga
 Due to a decrease in demand, car sales have fallen by nearly 17 per cent in April, the biggest drop in eight years

 The GDP growth rate for the previous fiscal year is estimated at 98 percent
 2 fisadi se kam he
 According to a recent analysis by the Reserve Bank, the growth in GDP will be lower than anticipated due to the decrease in government spending and increasing imports
 jidipi hi arthvyavastha kii tarakkee ko maapne kaa sabase bada aankada hota he
 Declining According to government spending, fixed deposits such as growth in investment and private consumption are rising, but government spending has come down
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki vitt varsh ke ant yani march tak sarkari kharch bad jate hai
 But this time the government cut its spending to meet the fiscal deficit target
 haal kii ek report ke anusaar bhartiya nijee kshetra kii arthvyavastha bhi dhimi vruddhi dar ke daur se guzar rahi he
 a major reason for this is the disruption caused by elections
 sarkaar ban jane ke baad companiyon ke haal main aamtaur par sudhaar kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Exports grew at a four-month low in April
 april main vastuon kaa niryaat pichley saal ke samaan maheene kii tulana main 0
 With a 64 percent increase to $ 26 billion, the trade deficit also reached a five-month high

 4 arab dollar rahaa, haalanki itane kam badhat ke baavjood chah maah kii sabase adhik vruddhi he
 In April, the trade deficit ie the difference between export and import increased to 15
 33 arab dollar ho gaya
 This 13 in April 2018
 72 arab dollar tha, yah november, 2018 ke baad vyapaar ghate kaa sabase ooncha str he
 Increase of exports is necessary for growth of industries

 The challenge of balancing the fiscal deficit and balancing government spending in a way will be before the Modi government
 desh ke maathe par badhata karjdesh par karj lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 Putting it under control will also be a major challenge for the Modi government

 The challenge of crude oil and inflation has increased tensions between the us-china trade war on the international front and the US has banned oil exports from Iran

 chunaav kii vajah se sarkaar pichley kaaphi dinon se petrol-dijal kii keemton main badhat ko roke hue thi, lekin ab isamen acchhee khaasi badhan kerani padegi
 Due to this, inflation will start rising again, while the Modi government has been praised so far, it has been able to control inflation
 desh kii khudara mahangaai april main 2
 92 percent, which was 2 March
 86 fisad kii tulana main adhik he
 In fact, retail inflation has increased in April compared to March due to the rise in food prices

 Exploded in Malegaon

 He said that infiltration is happening from Pakistan
 purvottar ke kuch rajyon main ugravad he, naksalwad ek anya chunauti he
 An atmosphere is being prepared against peace but development will do its full work
 shinde ne vampanthi hinsa prabhavit ilaakon main vikaas ke jariye naksalwad ke samaadhaan kii vakaalat kii
 Facilities have to be provided to bring peace in Naxalite affected areas
 unhone kaha ki congress ekmaatr aisi party he ki jo dharm nirpekshata ke moolbhoot siddhant kaa paalan karti he or usne daliton, anusuchit jati evam janajati tathaa alpsankhyak varg ke kai sadasyon ko aage badhane kaa mauka diya he
 Shinde said that our leader Sonia Gandhi gave me, a Dalit leader, the opportunity to become the Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha
 anusuchit jati, janajati, anya pichhada varg, alpsankhyak samudaay se kai aise naam hai, jinhen mantri banaaya gaya or anya maukey diye gayi
 There is adequate representation of communities in government

 When Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar was asked to comment on Shinde's statement that whether Shinde is right that the Sangh and BJP are running terrorist training camps, Iyer said that it is hundred percent correct
 shukr he ki kam se kam desh ke grih mantri ke str par yah baat sweekaar kii gayi

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while replying to the discussion on the President's address, criticized the Congress in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, but during this time he also exposed the weakness of his government in this Upper House of Parliament which had hampered his decisions in the first term
 Stuck
 modi ne zikr kiya ki beete paanch saalon main kuch vidheyakon kaa samay nikal gaya, kyonki sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main sankhya nahin he
 Saying this, PM Modi gave a call that we need to get rid of this barrier
 modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main kai aise bill rahe jo rajyasabha main purna bahumat na hone ke kaaran paas nahin ho paae or inamen sabase ahm teen talaak se judaa vidheyak he
 Despite forming an absolute majority government in the Three Divorce Bill 2014, the Modi government had to go backfoot on several occasions
 piem modi ne notebandi or jiesti jaisaa bada faisla raaton-raat lagu kar diya lekin jab baat teen talaak ke kanoon kii ai to rajyasabha main bahumat na hona unke iraadon par pani pher gaya
 The BJP could not get the support of any opposition party, including Congress, apart from its allies on this bill related to the rights of Muslim women
 yahi vajah rahi ab tak yah bill kanoon kaa rup nahin le sakaa he
 It has once again been introduced in the Lok Sabha but it can be challenged in the Rajya Sabha
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyakanaagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak ko janvari 2019 main loksabhaa main paas kar diya gaya tha, lekin rajyasabha main yah paas nahin ho sakaa tha
 After this, the bill was repealed with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
 ab ek baar phir modi sarkaar is bill ko laane kaa praytn karegi
 But the way opposition parties have been questioning this bill and it is being strongly opposed in the northeastern states, it will be challenging to pass this bill again in front of both houses in front of Modi government
 kul 22 bill rahe lambitatin talaak or nagirakata kanoon ke alaava indian medical council sanshodhan bill, trade union sanshodhan bill, company sanshodhan bill, kendriya uniwarsity sanshodhan bill or maanavadhikaar sangrakshan sanshodhan bill bhi modi sarkaar ko rajyasabha main purna bahumat na hone kaa ahsaas kara chuke hai
 a total of 22 bills, including the DNA Technology Regulation Bill and the Homeopathy Bill, have met the opposition in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main endie kii maujuuda taqatmodi sarkaar 2014 se zyada bahumat ke saath dobaaraa satta main ai he lekin rajyasabha main ab bhi uske paas bahumat nahin he
 The NDA coalition currently holds 100 seats in the Rajya Sabha, while it will have to wait for next year's state assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand, to achieve the 123 figure needed for a majority
 endie kii 100 siton main se 72 siten bijepi kii hai jabaki congress ke netritv vaale upie ke paas 73 siten hai
 By next year, 81 seats in Rajya Sabha are being vacated
 haalanki, isse pehle 5 july ko 6 siton ke liye upachunaav hone ja rahe hai, lekin isse bijepi ko bill paas karaane jaisi madad nahin mil paaegi
 These important bill pipeline in the pipeline include three divorce bills, Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (amendment) Bill, Amendment in Labor Law, Aadhaar Amendment Bill, Bills related to recruitment of teachers, Medical Council Amendment Bill, Motor Vehicle (amendment) But the impact of the government's weakness in Rajya Sabha can be seen again
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki narendra modi ne rajyasabha main dhanyavad prastaav par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main sankhya nahin he, lekin hamen is avrodh se chhutkaaraa paane kii jarurat he
 He also quoted former President Pranab Mukherjee as saying that the mandate of majority is to govern and the mandate of minority is to oppose, but there is no mandate to disturb anyone
 piem modi ne rajyasabha main kaha he ki hamen desh chalaanaa he or hamen aapke sahyog kii jarurat he
