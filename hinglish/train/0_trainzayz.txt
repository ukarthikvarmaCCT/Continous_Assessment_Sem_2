 raat ko sapana aata he ki aapako ek mandir bananaa he or subah uthakar aap sadak ke bich main mandir banane main jute jate hai
 It may sound a bit strange to hear, but a similar view was witnessed in Ramgarh, Jharkhand recently
 isse na sirf vikaas kaa aadhaar maane jane vaali sadak ke bichobich dharm kaa speedbraker khadaa kar diya gaya balki sampradayik sauhaard bhi khatre main pad gaya he
 People who defend religion are not ready to listen and a situation of confrontation has been created with the administration
 vakya bahut dilachasp he
 The people of Ramgarh state that there is a local female devotee here, who works to offer prayers
 use kareeb hafte bhar se sapana aa rahaa tha ki agar kankebaar main ban rahe neshnal hive-33 par jald hi kaali mandir kii sthapana nahin kii gai to logon par museebaton kaa pahaad tut saktaa he
 The Dakshineswar Kali temple there was removed due to the construction of the National Highway
 usne apane sapane ke bare main sthaneey logon ko bataaya to 19 janvari ko baari bheed jute gai or sadak ke bichobich mandir bananaa shuru kar diya
 People erected an eight-foot wall for the temple
 prashasnic amala jab nirmaan kaa kaam rokane pahunchaa to bheed usase ulajh padi or police dekhati rah gai
 But the matter did not just end here
 is maamle kii prishthbhumi teen saal pehle hi taiyaar ho gai thi, jab ramgarh shahar ke bahari chor se neshnal hivej athurity of india (enechaeai) kii ore se rajmarg ke map ke liye survey kiya ja rahaa tha
 "when the Dakshineshwar Kali temple was being removed and installed on Maya Tungri on July 10, 2012, then SDO Deepak Kumar and DSP Dhananjay Kumar spent a week there," says Damodar Mahato, former District President of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM)
 There was also talk of removing the mosque located
 lekin mandir ko hataa diya gaya or masjid ko surakshit kar liya gaya he
 This is a fraud with the villagers
 ''enech-33 lagbhag 352 kilometre lanbaa he
 The four-lane dispute at Kankbar outside Ramgarh city started fresh on the new map on 16 January
 nae map ko lekar enechaeai ke adhikari site par pahunche the, jinhone logon ko bataaya ki vahaan kii nuri masjid ko bachaa liya gaya he
 After this information, there was a fast message among the temple supporters that they have been cheated
 puraane map ke mutabik, dakshineshwar kaali mandir ko hataa diya gaya jabaki masjid ko bachaane ke liye nayaa map banaaya gaya he
 Hence, the very next day the atmosphere turned against the administration
 19 janvari ko hi graminon se baatcheet ke liye esadio karyaalay main baithak yojit kii gai
 At the same time, Section 107 notice was issued against about two dozen women-men from the SDO office
 is karrwai ne graminon ke aakrosh ko bhadkaa diya
 The conversation failed as soon as the people involved in the meeting got the information
 logon ne aakrosh main police or prashasnic adhikariyon kii maujuudagi main mandir bananaa shuru kar diya or shaam tak aath foot oonchi diwaar khadi kar di
 The idol of Dahnineswar Kali was called from Varanasi and the worship ceremony started after installing it
 baat dharm kii ho or vivaad bhi maujuud ho to rajnatik rotiyaan senkane vaale bhi aa hi jate hai
 Here Vishwan Hindu Parishad (VHP) international general secretary Pravin reached Togidaya and took out a motorcycle procession with hundreds of VHP activists
 unhone kaha, ''pehle yahaan mandir tha baad main sadak bani
 Therefore the temple will be built here
 ''iske agle din hazaribagh ke saansad or bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha bhi vahaan pahunch gaye or prashasan ko kathghare main khadaa kiya, ''saansad hone ke naate main enechaeai ke sampark main rahata tha
 It was decided at that time that both the temple and the mosque would be removed
 pichley saal 3 disambar ko disi karyaalay main baithak main kaha gaya tha ki 30 disambar tak masjid hataa lee jaaegi
 Then how did this change happen all of a sudden? '' He paid Rs 25,000 for the temple construction
 bhi de die
 He said, "BJP does not do politics of appeasement
 secularism kaa matlab alpsankhyak tushtikaran nahin he
 She will oppose such politics
 ''udhar, damodar mahato kehete hai, ''jab masjid bachaana sambhav tha to mandir bachaane ke liye pahal kyon nahin kii gai jabaki graminon ne prashasan se mandir ko bachaane kaa anurodh bhi kiya tha
 The then Deputy Commissioner Amitabh Kaushal had said that it is not possible to change the map of NHAI
 lihaaja, mandir ke alaava primary skool or kareeb dedh darjan karwaali adivasee parivaar bhi bedakhal kar die gaye
 "boil is not limited here

 The administration has failed on every front
 is masale par sarkaar or vipaksh kii bhoomika bhi asamvedansheel he, jisase bhram kii sthiti kaayam he
 However, the Deputy Commissioner of Ramgarh, Dr
 sunil kumaar singh hafte bhar main masjid ko hataae jane jaise kisi bhi tarah ke aashwaasan ko khaarij karte hai
 He said that what is being described as the land of the temple is a private complex (dr
 lalita kaa awasaiya parisar) tha
 For this, they have also been compensated
 yahi nahin, upayukta ne apni kisi bhi tarah kii prashasnic laaparvaahee or gaiyr-jimmedaari ko khaarij kiya
 He said, "I was out on vacation during the temple construction
 mujhe is ghatana kii jaankaree nahin thi
 After this case, the district administration revoked the arms license of local BJP leader Dhananjay Kumar
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se koi pratikriya nahin di gai
 Rajendra, vhp's organization minister for South Bihar region, says, "there is a common law for all citizens of the country

 maujuuda sthal se 300 meter duuri kii paridhi main enech ke liye jameen uplabdh kara di jaati to aise halaat nahin paidaa hote
 People say that the Muslim community objected to the possibility of the mosque being removed and requested the district administration to change the map
 disambar main prashasan ne iske liye enechaeai se aagrah kiya, jis aadhaar par nayaa map taiyaar hua
 But no official is confirming this
 police adheekshak ranjit prasad ne kaha ki har sthiti par najar rakhi ja rahi he
 But in the politics of religion, NH construction is closed and worship in the newly built temple continues

 The court said that there is no need for an early hearing in this case, and the court said that the case will be heard on the basis of the general list

 is bich, ravivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne fatehpur main ek chunavi raily main aisa bayaan diya jiske baad hindu-muslim cord uchhal kar saamne aa gaya
 Why the hindu-muslim cord jumped? Actually, Modi accused the Akhilesh government of the state of discriminating on the basis of religion and caste
 kaha, 'ramadan main bijli aati he to diwali main bhi aani chahie
 There should not be discrimination
 yadi qabristaan he to shmashaan bhi hona chahie
 Lightning should come on the occasion of both Eid and Holi
 kisi bhi surat main bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav retaliated to this statement of reply by Akhilesh to Modi
 kaha- pradhanmantri ganga kii saughandh khaaen or bolen ki varanasi main choubees ghante bijli aa rahi he yaa nahin
 This issue will dominate in the rest of the phase? After the reaction of Akhilesh Yadav on the Prime Minister's statement, there were speculations in the political circles that whether the parties will play the hindu-muslim card in order to put themselves ahead in the upcoming elections of UP? It is also being said that the BJP has laid a trap through this statement of the Prime Minister

 Since the shooting of the film Padmavati (now Padmavat) started in November 2016, the film has been in controversy over history ever since
 lagaataar ho rahe virodh ke baavjood film 25 janvari ko relies ho rahi he
 Nana Patekar said on Padmavat, if people make a wrong film, then people will react, the protest about the film's story will be known only after watching the film and know the story of this film with us
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani terahavin shatabdi se shuru hoti he jab khilji vansh kaa shaasha jilaluddin khilji (raja muraad) afghanistan main apni tukdi ke saath baitha hua dilli ko jeetne kaa plan banaata rahata he
 At the same time his nephew Alauddin Khilji (ranveer Singh) arrives and marries uncle's daughter Mehrunisa (aditi Rao Hydari)
 kuch ghatnaon ke baad apane chachaa ko markar allaudin dilli kaa raja ban jaataa he
 On the other hand, when King Maharawal Ratan Singh (shahid Kapoor) of Mewar goes to Singhal country, he meets Princess Padmini (deepika Padukone)
 prem main padane ke baad maharaval padmini se shaadi karke unhen chittod lekar aate hai
 Meanwhile, due to some reasons, Raghav Chetan, the priest of the state, is expelled and he goes to Delhi angrily to proclaim Alauddin Khilji as Rani Padmavati
 purohit kii baton se prabhavit hokar allaudin, chittod par akraman karne ke liye nikalataa he
 After going to Chittor, he tricked Maharaval and brings him captive to Delhi and asks to see Queen Padmavati once in return for leaving the Maharaja
 iske baad kahani main kai mode aate hai or antat: jeet rajputon ke shaury or parakram kii hoti he
 Padmavat: Aditya is the beautiful wife of 'khalji', go to see Krejkay for the release of foreign films too
 Padmavat- The visual treatment in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film is his filmmaking style
 chaahe yuddh ke sikvence ho, maharaja or rani ke bich ke seen ho yaa phir johar kaa drishy ho, harek frem main aapako sanjay lila bhansaali kaa special tach dekhne ko miltaa he
 The art work of the film is amazing and whatever scenes come in front of your eyes give a pleasant experience to the eyes
 - film kii patakatha ko kaalpanik bataaya gaya he or kahani kaa ant to sabhi ko pehle se pataa he
 But the story is presented by Sanjay Leela Bhansali in a very interesting way
 - film main allaudin khilji or maharani padmini ke bich koi bhi dream sikvence yaa kisi bhi tarah kaa drishy nahin he
 In the film, an attempt has been made to show the Rajput society and its might on the screen, while the stories of the self-esteem of the women of that time have also been narrated
 - film main kirdaaron kii agar baat karen to deepika padukon kaa abhinay jabadast he
 Deepika's work in the role of Rani Padmini is admirable
 vahin shahid kapur ne maharaja rawal ratan singh ke kirdaar main ek jimmedaar pati or raja kaa kirdaar bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Ranveer Singh has left no stone unturned to portray a person of cruel personality like Alauddin Khilji on screen
 bahut hi adbhut or laajawab andaaj main ranvir ne apane kirdaar ke upar kaam kiya he or wo film main najar bhi aata he
 Apart from this, Raza Murad, Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Dimension and all the other characters have acted spontaneously
 - film kaa mujeec thik he
 Ghoomar, Ek Dil Ek Jaan and the rest of the song assist the screenplay of the film
 becoground score or yuddh ke dauraan ke sound film ko or bhi rich banaate hai
 Weak episodes The first time Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film has been tried in 3D, the quality of which could have been improved and the film is much longer
 khaas taur par interval se pehle kaa hissaa achche se edit kiya jaataa to kaaphi crisp ho sakati thi
 SC rejected all petition related to Padmavat ban, now the filmbox officefilm will be released in the entire country, the budget is being told about 180 crores and it is also being said that due to changing the release date repeatedly, its cost keeps increasing every day

 In 2006, Bitti was sentenced to seven years in prison for raping a 26-year-old German tourist in Alwar district of Rajasthan
 usee saal disambar main use parole mila or vah faraar ho gaya
 After absconding he remained missing for a long time and during this time he started to spend his new life first as a teacher, then an MBA student and finally a bank worker

 After an eight-hour-long interrogation by Nair, Raghav's story started to become unstable and it seemed that Raghav was indeed Bitti Mohanty
 iske baavjood bhi yah saaf taur par tab tak nahin kaha ja saktaa tha, jab tak finger printing, diene pareekshan yaa laai detector jaisi kisi bhi vaigyanik takanic se koi pushti nahin ho jaae
 Raghav was then taken to Rajasthan, from where he had disappeared in December 2006 during a 15-day parole found to visit his ailing mother in Cuttack
 poochtacha karne vaale pulicekarmiyon ne bataaya ki raghav shuruyaat main is baat se mukar gaya ki vah bitti he

 lekin jaise hi police ne use alvar balaatkaar cond ke aaropee kii tasviren or video clip dikhaae, vah tootna shuru ho gaya
 The Rajasthan Police believes that the best way to determine his identity is to match his DNA to the DNA of his parents

 It is less likely that his fingerprints are present in the police records as there was no dispute about his identity when he was first detained
 uski pahchaan ko tay karne kaa teesraa or antim tarika is baat par aakar tik jaataa he ki kerala police kitni baariki se uske farji dastavejon ko nishane par le paati he
 SP Nair told India Today, "we have almost resolved the matter

 shuruyaat main ise develop karne main unhen chah maheene kaa samay laga
 The biggest challenge before him was to create awareness within the industry
 unhone bataaya ki is product se kaise yahaan ke shramikon ko help milegi—ye juute phislan, acid, koltar, aag or duusari durghatnaon kii sthiti main pair kii hifaazat kar sakate hai
 Says Nitin, "A lot of things about safety footwear were developing in Europe and America
 ham logon ne kuch chijen vahaan se sikhin
 For example, in such shoes, the tow cap we used earlier was of low protection level
 phir aise material kaa istemaal hone laga jisase juute kaa vajan halkaa ho sake
 After that, comfort level which should have been of a labor, brought his technology in his country
 "nitin 1993-94 main jab england main pard rahe the to vahaan unhen kuch log sefti shoej pahane dikhe jisase ve aakarshith hue or unhone unase sample maang liya
 In those days, he did research in the market and saw that there is no culture of wearing such shoes here

 unhen meraa product bahut acha laga
 He provided shoes to all his workers
 yah 1995 kii baat he

 ab 8,000 jodi prati din kaa he
 This company is in the top ten worldwide
 deshbhar main isaki saat factoriyaan hai jisamen se teen gwalior main, teen kanpur main or ek mumbai main he
 Sharing his experience, Nitin says, "first of all, it took three to four months to understand the product from where the leather will develop, where the cap will come from, where will the machine come from for the plant
 har cheez ko samajhane ke baad pehali mashin maine apane haath se banaai thi
 i am an engineer myself
 vah choti mashin thi
 "he says he started the work by renting around 2,000 square feet of land in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh
 tab sab kaam haath se hota tha
 People used to get less to work
 isliye ve apane workaron ko apni bike par bithakar factory laate the or unhen kaam sikhaate the
 He himself had learned to work in a shoe company in England
 unhen pataa tha ki gwalior main sefti shoej kii factory kholane kaa uchit maahaul nahin tha
 Despite this, he opened the factory and trained people
 factory ko dhire-dhire badhaayaa or aaj unka total construshan aria saadhe chaar lakh varg foot he
 The company employs 1,600 people
 unhone udhaar ke paise se apni factory shuru kii thi
 But with hard work and perseverance, he increased the business
 baad main kuch bainkon se bhi madad lee
 Says Nitin, "in 1994, taking loans from a bank was also a challenge
 aaj samay badal gaya he
 My first bank was Andhra Bank
 maine 10 lakh ru
 Had taken a loan apni pehali mashin 1995 main england se emport kii thi jo ki 10 lakh ru
 Had
 uske baad ham logon ne palat kar nahin dekha
 New products continued to be innovated
 yah footvier industry puure vishwa kii third most complicated industry he
 People think that this shoe would have been made very easily
 lekin ise banane main 120 tarah ke ro material lagate hai
 "nitin also had to contend with conservative thinking
 ve kehete hai, ''brahman hone kii vajah se parivaar ke logon ne kaha ki ledar kaa kaam kaise kar sakate hai
 But i never thought about all these things
 "ve maanate hai ki is kaam main unki ejineering kii padhai ne bhi madad kii
 He says, "today we make most shoes with robots
 hamaari company desh kii sabase badi company he jahaan 27 mashinari hai jo automatic hai
 There are some operations that rely on robots
 hamaare yahaan do robot hai
 "there is no industry in the world where there are no safety shoes
 ''hamaari company har hajard kaa solution detii he
 As many types of hazards as we have shoes
 " unki company ke juute emmemasi, kol, chemical, pharma, rifinary, hospitality, construction kshetra main supplai hote hai
 His shoes cost Rs 300-4,000
 tak hai
 Export model Rs 3,000

 Nitin is going to leap higher in future
 unhone mumbai main korporate offis khol liya he
 He says, "by 2022, we will have a business of 200 to 500 crores
 tak pahunchaayenge
 By 2025, the Italian company is leaving behind Kofra, which produces 23,000 pairs of shoes per day

 The case was revealed when a video of a child in chains tied in a madrasa has surfaced
 is video ke aadhaar par police ne madrase ke do shikshakon ke khilaaf cese darj kar liya he
 According to the information, in Bombepur madrasa of Khizrabad town of the district, the teachers used to tie children with chains and beat them up when they could not do homework
 aise hi madrase ke ek bachche ne apane pita ayub se is tarchar kii kahani bataai thi

 This was proved once again when he re-nominated Rita bahuguna-joshi to the post of State Congress President to lead the Congress in the 2012 assembly elections
 aisa unhone is tathy ke baavjood kiya ki sanghathan main pradesh or centre str par bahuguna-joshi kaa tagada virodh he
 And then, bahuguna-joshi himself had confused a large section of Muslims approaching the Congress by welcoming the High Court's decision on the ownership claim at the controversial site in Ayodhya
 darasal, hycourt ke faisle par bahuguna-joshi kii satark pratikriya ko is tarah samaj liya gaya tha ki babari masjid ke maamle main koi thos ravaiya apnaane ke bajaae congress ek baar phir sandehaaspad raajnneeti kar rahi he
 In his statement, he said, "politicians should stay away from this (controversy)
" donon pakshon ko hi koi rasta nikaalane dijie
 We will keep our focus on the common man
 ''lekin na to pradesh party pramukh ke taur par unke dobaaraa manonayan kaa virodh or na hi lakhanu tathaa dilli main party ke rukh ko lekar musalamaanon main naaraazgi sonia gandhi ko uttar pradesh ko dobaaraa fatah karne main madadgaar hone vaali bahuguna-joshi kii kshamta par vishwaas jataane se roak saki
 It is well known that Digvijay Singh, general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh in the party also wanted to change leadership there
 chunaav ke liye taiyaar ho rahaa yah vishaal pradesh nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa grih rajya bhi he
 Sonia Gandhi may have confidence in this slim woman of 62 years and she is expecting him that her backbone will be as strong as steel for two hands to the Chief Minister of the state, Mayawati, but the situation develops in the right direction Is not happening bahuguna-joshi ko pradesh party adhyaksh pad kii bagdor phir se saunpane ke ek saptaah ke bheetar hi rahul gandhi ne achaanak apana mishan 2012 yah kahkar tyaag diya ki yah unka vichaar tha hi nahin balki media ke dimag kii upaj he
 Addressing a closed-door meeting of Youth Congress workers in Lucknow on November 12, Rahul said sarcastically that he had no mission 2012
 ''yah mishan 2012, 2017 yaa 2020 bhi ho saktaa he
 Our aim is to reach the party in our own majority
 'is tathy ke baavjood ki bahuguna-joshi rahul ke bhi samarthan kaa daawa karti hai, lakhanu main party ke netaa mishan 2012 ko ek anischitkaaleen mishan main badalane ke apane netaa ke faisle kii alag tarah se vyakhya karte hai
 According to him, Rahul is not confident of the state unit's ability to seize power from Mayawati in the elections that are barely 18 months later
 aisa maanane kii vajahen bhi hai
 In September 2007, just four months after Mayawati's landslide victory, since bahuguna-joshi has been nominated as state party president, the Congress has been losing in each by-election and also forfeiting bail
 haa, unhen is baat kaa shrey jarur diya ja saktaa he ki party ne lakhanu (pashchim) seat bhaajapa se chin lee thi
 It was considered a 'historic victory' because the Congress won this prestigious seat for the first time since 1984
 unke dobaaraa manonayan ke peeche kai or bhi kaaran rahe honge, lekin ek varisht party netaa ke anusaar, bahuguna-joshi ke paksh main nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa yah swabhaav bhi gaya ki yah parivaar dabaav main aakar kabhi koi faisla nahin letaa
 Without realizing this, one group tried to force Sonia to remove bahuguna-joshi, and on the other hand, another faction headed by senior central leaders appointed Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari to this post
 Pressured to do
 bahuguna-joshi kii tarah tiwari bhi elahabaad kshetra ke hi hai
 But Sonia did not like the tactics of pressure and reappointed the fully active bahuguna-joshi, who is older than many state presidents of Congress in age
 aakhir, aise netaa ginati main kam hi hai, jo 16 ghante kaam kar saken or janata se judane ke liye milon paidal chal saken
 The leaders had also complained to Sonia Gandhi that bahuguna-joshi had described the late Indira Gandhi as 'arrogant' in a book written on her late father Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna
 lekin bahuguna-joshi kaa kahana he ki yah baat ve khud sonia kii jaankaree main laa chuki hai or unke samaksh yah bhi spasht kar chuki hai ki unhone yah baat kyon or kis sandarbh main likhi thi
 According to internal sources, very few people know that Sonia did the job of finding and grooming a leader herself from Allahabad, the birthplace of nehru-gandhi family, in a clandestine manner
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki sonia lagaataar bolne vaali or yuvaaon or bujurgon se aasaani se samvaad sthapit kar lene vaali bhartiya itihaas kii is purv profvsar par anand bhawan or swaraj bhawan se jude apane swayan ke gaiyr rajnatik tantra ke jariye najar rakhti aa rahi thim
 Also, there was no leader in the state who could replace bahuguna-joshi
 pramod tiwari bhale hi is baar khud kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karne main safal rahe the, lekin apni jacket kaa rang bhi sattarudh party ke rang jaisaa hi karvaa lene kii unki aadat unke khilaaf gai
 As far as other leaders are concerned, they have either been tested in the past, or are happy with the ministerial posts at the center

 The difference between demand and supply is becoming evergreen and this is stated in the report of the Union Home Ministry
 tippaniyan The queues outside the banks are not decreasing, but rather increasing
 shaharon main kai ATM kaam nahin kar rahe jiske chalate logon tak paisa nahin pahunch rahaa
 The Ministry believes that it is now slowly impacting the law system
 enditivi india ko mili hui jaankaree ke mutabiq, grih mantralay tak jo rajyon se report aayi he uske mutabik, log chote dinomination ke rupye karch nahin kar rahe
 That is why hoarding is increasing and 100 rupee note is not coming in circulation
 aise main abhi halaat saamaanya hone main ek haftaa lagegaa
 Most of the trouble is being reported in the states of North East in the areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 sabase badi chintaa noton kii cirkulation ko lekar he

 The comments bainkon ke baahar qataarein kam nahin ho rahi hai balki balki bad rahi hai
 Many atms are not working in cities, due to which the money is not reaching the people
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki iskaa asar dhire dhire ab kaanoon vyavastha par pad rahaa he
 According to information received by NDTV India, according to the reports from the states till the Home Ministry, people are not spending small denominations
 isiilie jamkhori bad rahi he or 100 rupye kaa note cirkulation main nahin aa paa rahaa

 Varun Dhawan's film Badlapur has been given an 'A' certificate from the censor board
 is film ke liye pehle 'you e' certificate kii ummid thi, magar aisa nahin hua
 The censor board asked 'badlapur' to cut several scenes of the film to give 'UA' certificate, which the film's director Sriram Raghavan refused
 sensor board ne 'e' certificate dene ke liye kuch drishyon ko nikaalane ke saath-saath kuch dark or ection seen ko halkaa bhi karne ko kaha tha, magar nirdeshak shriram raghavan apni film or isaki kahani ke saath koi ched-chhaad karnaa nahin chaahate the
 That's why Raghavan thought it better to take the 'UA' certificate in the film without any cuts and modifications
 raghavan ke mutabik, film ke kisi drishy ko nikaalnaa film kii quality se samjhauta karnaa hota
 Varun Dhawan's Badlapur is a dark film with lots of action
 or haa varun ne is tarah kii film or bhoomika pehali baar kii he
 Varun's fans have also seen him doing comedy as a light-hearted boy till now
 unke phans kii sankhya bhi yuvaaon kii he
 In such a situation, getting his film 'A' certificate is at least a little worrying for Varun, because children will not be able to go to the cinema houses to see this film
 vahin duusari taraf nirmaataa ke liye bhi chintaa kii baat hogi kyonki 'e' certificate milane ke baad satellite rhite se bhi kam paise milte hai

 Bone has told in the interrogation that the Indian Mujahideen, who has shaken India by the blasts, has now become so nervous about his identity that he wants to erase his name, but this does not mean that terrorist attacks in India now To stop, but now al-qaeda wants to do the same thing directly, because the Indian Mujahideen now wants to erase their identity and join al-qaeda haal ke kuch saalon main hindustan main jab bhi dhamaake hue, indian mujahiddeen yani iem kaa naam jarur saamne aayaa
 Also, behind these scenes, behind the scenes, terrorist organizations like ISI, lashkar-e-taiba and Jaish were also exposed

 According to Bone, with the encouragement of the Indian intelligence and security agencies, now IM is facing difficulty in operating here
 aise main apana naam or apni pahchaan badalane ke sivaay unke paas koi chaara hi nahin he
 Bone has said that for some time, other top leaders of the Indian Mujahideen, including the Bhatkal brothers, were constantly consulting on the issue of renaming the organization

 rajasthan kii purv vasundhara sarkaar kii sabase badi swasthya yojana 'bhamashah yojana' gahalot sarkaar band kar sakati he
 The Finance Department of the Government of Rajasthan has recommended to discontinue the most popular scheme of the Vasundhara government of the state
 is bich logon kii naaraazgi or bijepi ke virodh se bachane ke liye gahalot sarkaar ne ek rasta nikaala he ki vah bhamashah yojana kii jagah centre kii modi sarkaar kii ayushmaan bharat yojana shuru karegi
 Rajasthan's Ayushman Bharat Jan Arogya Yojana can save about Rs 600 crore in Rajasthan
 darasal, purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne satta main aate hi sabase pehle bhamashah yojana lagu kii thi jiske liye card banaaya gaya tha
 This card had a picture of Vasundhara Raje on one side and the BJP symbol on the other side was the lotus sign
 card par kesaria or hare rang kaa bijepi ke jhande kaa rang bhi bana hua tha
 The Congress had also gone to court to protest against this, but had to face it
 rajasthan main bhamashah yojana ke tahat 4
 50 crore people come, on which Rajasthan government spends 1490 crores
 is yojana ke tahat 30 hajaar se lekar 3 lakh rupee tak kaa beemaa kaa cover miltaa he
 The scheme is applicable in 774 private hospitals in addition to all government hospitals in the state
 is yojana ko band karke ayushmaan bharat yojana shuru karne se rajasthan sarkaar ko centre se 900 karod rupee milenge kyonki ayushmaan bharat yojana main 60 fisadi kharch centre sarkaar uthaati he or 40 fisadi rajya sarkaar ko dena hota he
 The biggest thing is that only 1
5 crore people will be covered under this scheme, whereas 4 under the Bhamashah scheme
 50 karod hai
 That is why the Rajasthan government wants to take a thoughtful decision
 kahin paisa bachaane ke chakkar main logon kii naaraazgi na jhelni pade
 Because it is believed that the Vasundhara Raje government has been challenged in the assembly elections, the biggest reason for this was the Bhamashah plan
 yahi vajah thi ki centre kii modi sarkaar ke kehane ke baavjood vasundhara raaje ne apni yojana band nahin kii thi
 The Finance Department has recommended closure, but the Rajasthan Government has not taken any decision yet

 scindia ne kaha ki ijioem ne kerala evam anya rajyon ke liye bhi sookhaa raahat package manjuur kiya he
 Of the total 34 districts in Maharashtra, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Sangli, Pune, Satara, Beed and Nashik are the districts most affected by the drought
 buldhaana, latur, osmanabad, nanded, aurangabad, jaalnaa, jalgaanv or dhule jilon main bhi sthiti gambhir he
 Some districts in the state are facing acute shortage of fodder and drinking water

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has joined the headlines of 2017
 unhone rajya main rajd-jediu-congress mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ko 26 july ko giraaya or ek ghante ke andar pradhanmantri narendra modi kii endie gathbandhan kii sarkaar kaa hissaa ban gaye
 That is, resign from the post of Chief Minister in an hour and prepare the blueprint of the new government and then become the Chief Minister
 nitish kumaar ke liye yah pehla mauka nahin he jab unhone gathbandhan todane kaa faisla liya
 Even in 2014, he resigned from the post of Chief Minister simply because he did not approve of Narendra Modi's leadership and formed a grand alliance out of the then NDA alliance
 nitish kumaar kaa bataur mukhyamantri or bataur jediu netaa liye gaye faislon kaa aankalan karte hue yah samajha ja saktaa he ki kya vah bihar ke ek taqatvar mukhyamantri kahe jaaenge yaa phir vah ek kamjor mukhyamantri kii category main zyada feet honge
 These are the reasons which made Nitish weak 1
 mahagathbandhan kaa netritv karne main vifal2014 main bijepi ke haathon karaari haar ke baad vipaksh ke naam par desh main congress kii pehla vaala rajd-jediu-congress mahagathbandhan sabase ahm kadi thi
 However, the results of the Lok Sabha elections had thrown out this grand alliance
 phir 2015 main isane vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko rajya main tisare darje kii party bana diya
 Therefore, at the national level also this grand alliance was very important for the politics of opposition
 nitish kumaar ko 2015 ke chunaavon main mili jeet se is mahagathbandhan kaa netritv mila
 But in 3 years, Nitish not only refused to lead the coalition of opposition politics, but went a step ahead and joined the ruling coalition at the center
 2
 In the Bihar assembly elections held in 2015 as a chief minister, the Grand Alliance got the chance to form the government
 duusare number kii party hone ke baavjood mahagathbandhan ne nitish kumaar ko bataur vikaas kaa cheharaa project kar rajya kaa mukhyamantri banaaya
 It could have been a double century for Nitish Kumar provided that he could keep the government of this grand alliance strong by his leadership ability
 lekin sarkaar banane ke liye jaise hi unhen raajnneeti main entry karne vaale lalu ke donon beton ko sarkaar main na sirf shaamil kiya balki ek ko dipti siem banaakar rajya ke mukhyamantri ke taur par khud ko kamjor kar liya
 3
 avasar milte hi badalane kii fitartalalu prasad yadav ke sahare raajnneeti main aae nitish kumaar ko pehla mauka mila or vah lalu se alag ho gaye
 For the first time, separation from Lalu was an important decision for Nitish
 bihar kii raajnneeti main sidhe lalu ke vikalp kii taur par ubhare
 In the name of giving the basic mantra of development to the state, he remained in alliance with BJP but when the leadership of the coalition went to Modi, he left and joined the opposition alliance
 ek baar phir jab lalu ko saath lekar sarkaar banane kii majaburi saamne ai to bina kisi laag-lapet modi virodh ke paracham tale bihar ke mukhyamantri ban gaye
 But as soon as the dark clouds of corruption appeared on the coalition, within an hour, he took off one of the chief ministers and wore another
 4
 Nitish Kumar managed to carve out the image of Vikas Purush for himself, despite playing a key role in the failure of the state in the two decade long rule of Laloo Prasad Yadav
 lalu kheme se baahar aakar or endie main shaamil hokar vah bihar ke vikaas kaa map dene kii baat karte rahe
 But no concrete result of how much Chief Minister was able to reach Bihar in the path of development was not visible in the state's economic data
 lihaaja, sawaal bihar ke vikaas ke liye unke rodmap par bhi he ki kya bihar kii raajnneeti main unhone 'vikaas' ko mahaj ek jumala kii tarah istemaal kiya he
 5
 sushasan main sendargedy ke saath 2015 main sarkaar banane ke baad 2016 main ek mauka aisa bhi aayaa jab argedy ke purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin ko jamaanat mili
 Soon after getting bail in the tenure of this alliance, Shahabuddin made a statement that for him, Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav is because Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister under the circumstances
 haalanki, shahabuddin kaa yah bayaan unke or nitish kumaar ke rishte tak hi simit rahaa lekin is ek bayaan ne nitish kumaar ke sushasan ke daavon main sendhamari kar yah sabit kar diya ki rajya main mukhyamantri rahete hue bhi unki chhavi kuch tatwon ke liye for granted liye jane vaale netaa kii hi he

 -input bhashaa The Narendra Modi government at the Center has vigorously raised the issue of triple talaq during its tenure and has also enacted a new law regarding this
 ab isi kanoon ke tahat pehali badi karrwai hui he
 Ziku Rehman, who gave three divorces to his wife in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, has been arrested by the police
 rahamaan kii patni tarannum ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se maamle kii shikaayat kii thi
 The Supreme Court had termed the triple talaq as illegal
 teen talaak kanoon ke tahat hui ye pehali giraftaar he
 According to the complaint made by Tarannum, they were married five years ago, they also have three children
 lekin lagaataar rahamaan apni patni ko torchar kar rahaa tha
 Now last week, Rahman divorced his wife
 itnaa hi nahin, rahamaan ne ek yuvati se shaadi kar lee, jise vah madrase main padhaayaa karata tha
 The woman claims that she was evicted from the house after the divorce
 isi ke baad unhone apni guhaar mukhyamantri se lagaai or mukhyamantri ke karyaalay ne is par turant karrwai kii
 The case was first confirmed and the local police were asked to take action on the issue
 jaise hi maamle kii pushti hui to malpura police ne muslim marij protection act ke tahat jicru rahamaan ko giraftaar kar liya
 On prompt action by the CMO, Tarannum Begum told India Today that i hoped that the right action would be taken by the Chief Minister
 vahiin is tarah ke maamle uthaane vaale aamir kuraishi ne bhi yogi sarkaar ke ection kii tarif kii, unhone kaha ki police ne jis tarah se maamle ko sambhala he vah badhiya kadam he
 The new law will teach a lesson to Muslim men, who thus cheat their wives
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi apni har sabha main teen talaak se mudda uthaate rahe hai
 It has been said every time by the Bharatiya Janata Party that it is a practice to suppress the rights of Muslim women, which should be abolished
 sarkaar kii ore se is par abhi adhyadesh jari kiya gaya he, bill ko loksabhaa main bhi pesh kiya gaya tha
 But the bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress was requested to make some changes
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke mutabik, muslim mahilaon ko unke pati kii ore se teen 'talaak' bolkar talaak dene par pabandi lagaai gai he
 Under this, instant triple talaq is considered a punishable offense, with a provision of 3 years of punishment along with fine
 yah aparaadh tab sangyeya hoga jab vivaahit muslim mahila yaa phir uskaa kareebi rishtedaar us vyakti ke khilaaf soochna degaa, jisane tatkaal teen talaak diya he
 Cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar (om Prakash Rajbhar) has once again targeted his ally BJP in the Uttar Pradesh government

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday mocked the Congress for dreaming of forming a government at the Center and criticized the main opposition party on issues of national security and Jammu and Kashmir
 piemmodi ne matadaataaon se kaha ki ve congress or uske sahyogiyon ko is tarah se dandit karen ki ve loksabhaa chunaav main apni jamaantein bhi nahin bachaa paaen
 Addressing the rally in Bengaluru, he said that the Congress has promised to withdraw the army from Jammu and Kashmir and it is the language of Pakistan
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main zyaadaatar samay rashtriya suraksha par bolaa
 He said that Congress has spoken of coming to power in its manifesto
 piem modi ne kaha ki sapane dekhne se koun kisi ko roak saktaa he? lekin unhen sarkaar gathan ko lekar sapana dekhne dijie
 i can understand, because a tea-seller has seized the opportunities of four generations of the Sultanate
 piem modi ne congress par sashastr bal visheshadhikaar kanoon (afsapa) waapas lene ke uske chunavi vaade ko lekar hamalaa bolaa
 The Prime Minister also objected to the political rhetoric being made by the ruling congress-jd (S) coalition by the Income Tax Department in Karnataka against the recent raids against several JD-S people
 piem modi ne raily main aae logon se sawaal kiya ki kanoon kaa paalan hona chahie yaa nahin, chaahe vah pradhanmantri hon yaa mukhyamantri yaa mantri? aapane jab galat nahin kiya he to aap dare hue kyon hai? gat 28 march ko iskar vibhaag ne bengaluru, misuru, mandya, ramnagara, shivamoga or hasan main kai sthanon par chaape maare the jis par mukhyamantri ech di kumaraswami or congress ke netaaon kii ore se kadi pratikriya jataayi gai thi or centre par badale kii bhaavana kii raajnneeti ko aage badhaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Kumaraswamy described the Income Tax officials as agents of the BJP and led a sit-in in front of the Income Tax Department here on behalf of the ruling congress-jds coalition
 mangaluru main apane raily main piem modi ne kaha ki karnataka main congress-jades gathbandhan sattarudh he or ek jaise ‘parivaravaad' se prabhavit partiyaan hai or yahaan tak ki parivaar ke antim sadsy ko satta dene main yakeen rakhte hai

 The Shiv Sena also sought to know from Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis how Owaisi was allowed to leave the state after refusing to raise pro-india slogans
 gyaat ho ki aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne beete dinon ek suzav dete hue kaha tha ki nai peedi ko bharat mata ke sammaan main naare lagaana sikhaye jane kii jarurat he

 How can the people who were responsible for running the LHB by removing the ICF coach of the Kakodkar Committee, formed in the affairs of safety 4 years ago, be responsible for this accident?

 sangh lok seva ayog (upiessi) dwaara yojit civil seva pariksha paas kar iees adhikari banane kaa sapana sanjoe pawan pandeya chah saal pehle jab jharkhand ke koderma jile se dilli ravaanaa hue the, to unhen bilkul andaja nahin tha ki apana lakshya paane kii kavayad ke tahat unhen aamaran anshan tak karnaa padegaa
 Pawan, 31, and 29-year-old Neelotpal Mrinal, 29, hailing from Bihar, from July 9 in the Mukherjee Nagar locality in protest against alleged discrimination against candidates of 'non-english' medium and 'humanities' background in the UPSC Civil Services Examination
 i am on hunger strike
 pawan or mrinal kaa samarthan kar rahe hajaaron civil seva ummidavaaron kii pramukh maang he ki upiessi civil seva praarambhik pariksha ke duusare prashn-patr 'civil sarvice aptitude test' (sisat) ko khatm kiya jaae
 In this regard, Pawan said, "CSAT is taking away the opportunity to go into civil service from people who have a rural background and who have not studied in English medium schools
 sisat se angreji madhyam ke ummidavaaron - khaskar jinaki prishthbhumi vigyaan, ejineering yaa medical kii rahi he - ko phayda mil rahaa he, jabaki gaiyr-angreji madhyam evam gaiyr-vigyaan prishthbhumi ke ummidavaar buree tarah pichad rahe hai
 ' pawan kii baton se sahamat mrinal kaa kahana he, 'sisat ko shuru to is makasad se kiya gaya tha ki isse ummidavaaron kii prashasnic yogyata ko parkhaa jayega, lekin is prashn-patr main kul 80 main se 5-6 sawaalon ko chhod aisa kuch nahin hota jisase civil sarvice aptitude kii parakh hoti ho
 ' mrinal ne bataaya, 'ummidavaaron kii prashasnic yogyata parakhane ke naam par sisat ke prashn-patr main ganit, comprihension, angreji comprihension ke aise sawaal puche jate hai, jinhen hal karne main vigyaan, ejineering or medical prishthbhumi ke ummidavaar khud ko zyada sahaj pate hai
 Whereas non-english medium candidates from humanities background get entangled in the complexity of these questions and do not know when the time of two hours is over
 ' Vikas Kumar, who has been preparing for the Civil Services Examination for the last five years, staying in Mukherjee Nagar, said, 'the biggest problem with non-english medium candidates is that translations of CSAT questions are of such poor quality that ever - Sometimes meaning is lost
 ' Vikas says that when other candidates of Hindi medium or non-english medium do not understand the questions translated in their language in the question paper due to its poor translation then they see the questions written in English
 lekin angreji main sahaj na ho paane ke kaaran ve phir apni bhashaa main likhe prashn kii taraf lautate hai or isi kavayad main vakt biit jaataa he
 Despite knowing the answers to the question many times, they are unable to solve it in time
 natijatan, ve praarambhik pariksha main hi pratispardhaa se baahar ho jate hai
 ' sisat ke virodh main lagaataar pradarshan kar rahe ummidavaaron kaa aarope he ki civil seva pariksha ke antim parinaam main hindi madhyam ke ummidavaaron kii safalataa dar 2005-10 ke dauraan jahaan 15-20 fisadi rahati thi, vah 2013 main ghatakar mahaj 2
 It is 3 percent
 beete shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main sapa saansad dharmendra yadav or bhaajapa saansad yogi adityanath ne bhi sisat samaapt karne kii maang kii
 Yadav said that the implementation of CSAT is a conspiracy against students with rural background and Hindi speaking and other regional language speakers
 sapa netaa ne kaha ki 2008 kii praarambhik pariksha main 45 fisadi, 2009 main 42 fisadi or 2010 main 35 fisadi aise ummidavaar safal hue the jo gramin yaa hindi bhashi prishthbhumi ke the, jabaki sisat lagu hone ke baad yah ghatakar mahaj 11 fisadi rah gaya
 Efforts to get the response of UPSC to the allegations of the protesting candidates have not been successful so far
 baharhaal, upiessi ke purv sadsy or jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity main hindi ke purv professor purushottam agarwal se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'main upiessi, jo ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he, kaa sadsy rah chukaa hum

 It was a scary experience for these youngsters, who grew up in middle-class families with a fear of police, to suddenly get caught in a swirl of disputes

 "who can debate this?" netflix jab 1997 main sirf 30 karmchaaree or 925 filmon ke saath shuru hua tha
 Today 14 of Netflix worldwide
 88 karod graahak hai
 Meaning, Netflix has made tremendous progress in a few years
 saal 2017 main netflix par 40 filmein relies kii gai thi
 It was estimated that 80 films would be released by 2018
 internet par filmon or tivi siries ke is daur se pehle film release hone ke baad nirmaataa use kisi or website par relies karne se pehle 12 hafte kaa antar rakhte the
 But ever since Netflix has come, it has changed these rules
 ab jis din film theatre main relies hoti he, usee din netflix ghar baithe graahakon tak apni film bhi pahunchaa detaa he
 Netflix's success is proving that screen size doesn't matter to customers today
 agar unhen acha content parosa jaae to vah keemat chukaane ko taiyaar hai
 Today, Netflix is earning more than Hollywood movies
 jahaan hollywood industry main napha-nuksaan laga rahata he, vahiin netflix kaa phayda har saal sirf badhata hi ja rahaa he
 It has not suffered a single year since 2015
 netflix har ek saal main 300 karod tak kaa munafa kama hi letaa he
 The question is how will Hollywood deal with this dominance of Netflix
 arabon kaa kaarobaar karne vaala hollywood kya nai takanic ke jamaane main apane theatron ko ghutane ke bal baith jane degaa?hollywood main sikwals kaa daur teji se shurunetflix kii chunauti kaa saamana karne ke liye hollywood apane pehle se aajamaae hue nuskhon par kaam karne vaala he

 Therefore, Hollywood has already started planning to make more than 100 films from 2019 to 2027
 lekin aisa lag rahaa he ki nadi kii dhar ulti bahani shuru ho gai he
 While Hollywood has insisted on a sequel to original content, Netflix has begun to expand its original content, be it series or movies
 2016 main netflix kii 25 fisadi saamagree moulik rup main aani shuru hui thi
 But from 2018, 51 percent of the content has started being original
 iske baavjood hollywood taaja saamagree ke saath vaapasi kii koshishon main laga he

 purv videsh sachiv es jaishankar ke videsh mantri banane ke baad kayaas ye lage ki kya wo swaraj ke shuru kiye aam logon kii fori madad kaa ye zariyaa, ye tareeqa barqaraar rakhenge
 But within 48 hours Jaishankar made it clear that the way has been open for people to ask for help from the External Affairs Minister via Twitter
 asal main is ek kadam ke kai myne hai
 For the first time, the Ministry of External Affairs, considered far away from the reach of the elite and the common people, connected with the people in this way
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke khulne ke baad badi sankhya main bhartiya desh ke baahar kaam ke liye jane lage
 And now many multinational companies work here and it is common for Indian employees to go abroad

 In such a situation, the number of problems has also increased
 or kai baar desh ke baahar duutavas yaa consulate se manamafik madad na milane se aam logon ko lagata tha ki is mantralay se na sunwaayee he na judaav
 But when Sushma Swaraj started helping people on social media, there was an engagement and work even in the farthest Indian embassies
 or kaam kii prashansa or pahchaan bhi hui
 In such a situation, continuing such work not only connects the ministry and the minister with the people, but also brings a political support and trust for the minister

 Now preparations are on to bring him to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat

 In the morning, the Ganga Aarti at the Assi Ghat was in the name of Ustad, then there was a Vedic chant after Aarti on the birthday of Ustad, who was always the bearer of the ganges-jamuni Tehzeeb in Benaras, then the shehnai started to sing the tune, which the master had sat on the banks of the Ganga for years
 Used to narrate
 ye dhun thi "ganga dwaare badhaiyaan baaje"
 After this, the entire scene of Banaras in the morning was wrapped in Maestro's memories
 ustad bismmillah khan ko banaras kii baalooshahi mithai bahut pasand thi, lihaaja janm din ke maukey par bade se baalooshahi ko kek kaa shakl dekar kaata gaya
 Ustad's psyche daughter Soma Ghosh performed with him the songs of the Banaras Gharana with which Jugalbandi had once performed
 subah ke is kaarykram ke baad assi ghat ke isi manch par shaam ko ek baar phir mehafil juty, jisamen sabase pehle saat shehanai ke sur ke bich deep prajvalan hua
 After that, different artists of Banaras through their raga greeted Ustad on his birthday
 is maukey par table or sitar kii bhi jugalbandi hui, jisamen table par ustad ke saath bajaane vaale unke apane bete najim hossain the, to sitar par pandit shivnath mishra or devvrat mishra the
 Talk about the birth day of Ustad Bismillah and how could it not be heralded by his son Jamin Hussain Bismillah who saved his legacy
 lihaaja unke bete ne sabase pehle ganga ke dwaar par ustad kaa vahi dhun chhedaa, jo ustad ganga ko sunaaya karte the or badale main ganga ne bhi unke suron main apni mithaas gholi thi
 The program also featured a short film based on the journey of Ustad Bismillah from his birth to his music
 is avasar par banaras ke lagbhag sabhi sangitajna upasthit the, jinhone kabhi dyodhi ke baahar bajane vaale vaadya yantra ko apni phoonk se itani oonchai di ki wo aaj logon ke gharon ke angan kii shobhaa ban gai he
 But the regret of not having such an instrument in any university course was visible
 shastreey gayak pandit rajeshwar aacharya ne kaha ki ye afsos kii baat he ki jis vaadya yantra ko bismmillah itani oonchai par le gaye the, wo aaj aaj kisi bhi uniwarsity main sikhaai nahin jaati
 Although the governments may not pay attention, but the master used to rule the hearts of the people
 wo banaras ke kan-kan main rache-based the, lihaaja unke apane shahar banaras ne unhen janm din par na sirf badhaiyaan deen, balki jam kar unki yaad main jiya bhi
 Today Maestro may not be among us but he has left his clarinet with us, so that every tune emanating makes us feel like our own Maestro Bismillah Khan is around us

 Reacting strongly to the brutal killing of two Indian soldiers by Pakistani troops infiltrating Indian territory near the Line of Control (loc) in Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday said that the central government should take tough decisions against Pakistan

 The government should take tough measures
 aisi sthiti main ham sarkaar kaa samarthan karenge
 The BJP leader, however, termed the government as weak and said that unfortunately there is a very weak government in the country, which is unable to take strict measures
 unhone kaha ki yah desh ke sammaan kaa maamla he
 It is a question of morale of the armed forces
 sarkaar ko kaam karnaa hoga or kade kadam uthaane honge

 That is, now business activities can be extended from the ground floor to the third and fourth floors
 aasaan shabdon main kahen to local shopping centre, commercial complex or kanviniyent shopping centre vaali jagahon par ceiling nahin hogi
 The question of the shopkeepers is the question of the traders of Sadar Bazaar, who have been doing business in Delhi for years, whether the ceiling will be stopped by increasing the FAR, or there is a screw in it too
 jaankaron kii maane to centre sarkaar kii taraf se jari notification main special aria kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Which means that conversion charges and parking charges can also be charged from Old Delhi markets
 master plan main sanshodhanaye kahata he ki 1962 se pehle bane bazaaron ko mixd land ke tahat vyapaarik gadhividhiyon main chhot di jaaegi
 But the question still remains, where will the shopkeepers with such markets bring the evidence before 1962? kyonki sanshodhan main iskaa bhi zikr nahin he
 Not only this, the revised master plan also does not mention how the shops which have been sealed in the last 7 months will be de-sealed

 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni says that no player should be dropped from the team due to a bad series
 england ke lambey daure kii shuruyaat se pehle buudhvaar ko dhoni ne kaha ki khilaadiyon ko form main vaapasi kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 Dhoni said in his first press conference after reaching England, 'I believe it is important to support the players
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki vah captain he, batsman he yaa phir bowler
 Team India will try to forget the dismal 2011 tour and start a positive start to the three-day warm-up game here on Thursday

 At present, it is very difficult for home buyers to get their money stuck in the stuck project
 ibisi main bhi home byrs kii madad ke liye kuch behatar praavdhaan nahin hai
 Presently, this is the system: Home buyers have been included as 'unsecured creditors' in the current form of IBC
 isaki vajah se hota yah he ki jab koi real estate company makaan dene ke apane vaade ko puraa nahin karti or inasolvency kaa saamana karti he to makaan kharidaaron kii is prakriya main koi bhoomika nahin hoti

 agar aisa hota he, to home byrs kii taraf se ghar kharidne ke liye die gaye paise ko bhi 'kamasharyil borowing' ke taur par shaamil kiya jayega
 In this way, it will be quite easy for buyers to get their money

 Because of this, even after paying the money, home buyers are unable to find a home

 Everything was fine till two months ago with BK Bansal appointed to the post of Director General (director General) in Corporate Ministry of Government of India
 magar 17 july 2016 ko sibiai ne achaanak inke ghar par chapa maaraa or bansal ko giraftaar kar liya
 He was charged with possessing disproportionate assets with bribery
 idhar bansal giraftaar hue udhar do din baad hi unki patni or beti ne ghar main pankhe se jhul kar khudakushi kar lee
 And now two months and eight days later BK Bansal and his son have also committed suicide
 ab baap bete ne bhi marane se pehle alag-alag suicide note choda he
 When the mother and daughter had committed suicide, both of them had written different suicide notes, now the father and son have also written different suicide notes
 ghar se police ko suicide note kii kul chaar copy mili he
 According to DCP East-to Rishipal, BK Bansal has written a 5-page suicide note while his son Yogesh Bansal has written a 2-page
 donon ne suicide note kii ek-ek copy har kamare main or yahaan tak ki ek copy drawing room main bhi rakh di thi
 On the other hand, according to DCP Rishipal, BK Bansal has accused some CBI officials of harassing and harassing him in his suicide note
 bansal ne apane suicide note main apni bivi or beti ke bhi suicide note kaa zikr kiya he
 According to the Delhi Police, a copy of Bansal's suicide note will also be sent to the CBI to investigate the allegations against his officers
 haalanki bike bansal or unke bete kii khudakushi kii khabar milte hi sibiai ne ek bayaan jari kar unki maut par afsos jataayaa he
 In the statement, the CBI has said that BK Bansal was an accused in a bribery case and was arrested on 16 July
 patni or beti kii maut ke baad 20 or 21 july ko antarim jamaanat par unhen reeha kar diya gaya tha
 After this, on 30 July Bansal came out on regular bell
 is cese kii tafteesh abhi bhi jari he
 The statement further said that Bansal's son has never been an accused in this bribery case nor has he ever been summoned by the CBI for questioning
 aapako bataa den ki bike bansal par bhrashtachar kaa jo iljaam laga tha wo nau lakh rupye kaa he
 According to CBI, Bansal took this bribe amount to benefit a Mumbai company
 bansal or unke bete kii maut ke baad mangalvaar ko sibiai ne jo bayaan jari kiya he usamen bhi bas rishwat ke isi ek maamle kaa zikr he
 However, the CBI says that investigation of the case is still going on
 jaanch puri nahin hui he
 Apparently after this the matter would have gone to court and then it would have been decided whether Bansal was innocent or guilty
 magar usase pehle hi bansal kaa puraa parivaar khatm ho gaya

 Court has to be filled in
 Violation of traffic rules can lead to refusal of confession in Challancourt
 Vehicle owner starts summit trial in court, police has to present the Vitennasya Motor Vehicle Act has come into effect from September 1
 iske tahat trephic niyamon ke ulanghan par jurmaane kii dar main ijapha kiya gaya he
 new Motor Vehicles Act, the traffic police is fully alert and is continuously cutting huge challans
 kai logon kii shikaayat he ki trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin karne par bhi police chaalaan kaat rahi he
 If someone violates one rule, then a huge challan is being cut by making a case of violation of many rules
 agar aapane bhi trephic niyamon kaa puraa paalan kiya he or aapke vaahan kaa chaalaan kaat diya gaya he, to aapako ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin hai
 Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra says that Challan to Court is being done at the moment
 on spot chaalaan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 This means that if the traffic police deducts the challan of your vehicle, then you have to go to the court of the area where the challan is violated for violation of traffic rules
 trephic police onspot chaalaan bharne ke liye majaboor nahin kar sakati he
 Advocate Markandeya Pant said that when you go to court to file an invoice, you have two options
 pehla vikalp yah hota he ki aap court main jaaen or jurm kabool karte hue jurmaana bhar den
 Apart from this, another option is that you can refuse to confess
 iske baad court kaa maamle main samari trial (summary trial) hota he
 If your challan is wrongly deducted, then you get relief from the court
 haalanki agar aap doshi paae jate hai, to aapako jurmaana adaa karnaa padataa he
 Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra and Advocate Markandeya Pant say that it is necessary to have a witness sign in the challan
 agar court main maamle kaa samari trial chalata he, to trephic police ko vitaness pesh karnaa hota he
 If the police cannot present the witness, the case is dismissed
 edwocket markandeya pant kaa kahana he ki police zyaadaatar maamalon main vitaness pesh nahin kar paati he, jiske chalate maamla khaarij ho jaataa he
 However, it has to go through a summary trial
 samari trial kaa matlab yah he ki in maamalon ko jald se jald niptaya jaataa he
 You can also fill the challan online
 If the traffic police challans your vehicle, you cannot be forced to fill the onspot challan
 aapke paas ilaake kii court main jaakar chaalaan kaa bhugtan karne yaa phir https: / / echallan

 Apart from this, if the driving license, insurance, RC or pollution check certificate is not available, the police can also confiscate your vehicle
 iske baad court se vaahan tabhi chhutegaa, jabaki vaahan kaa maalik sabhi dastavej pesh karegaa
 The traffic police cut back huge challans

 congress ne bataaya ki rajyasabha sadsyta ke chunaav main bhi bijepi ne kharid-farokht kii koshish hui thi
 Gujarat's Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani said that BJP has been doing this manipulative politics
 jis tarah gujarat model kaa bhanda phuta he or gujarat kii janata sadakon par ai he, uske baad bijepi or bhi logon ko kharidne kii koshish karegi

 The religious significance of the Brahmaputra river in Assam has become quite relevant for the new term of BJP national president Amit Shah
 kalki puraana ke mutabik, parashuram ne apni mata renuka ko farse se maarane kaa pashchaatap ek pavitra nadi main nahaakar kiya tha
 When his father Jamadagni suspected his mother, Parashurama severely severed his mother's head
 lekin dosha ke kaaran vah farsa unke haath se hi chipak gaya
 On the advice of sages and sages, he went to many ashrams and then broke the hills of Kurd and took out the holy water for the people, which separated his hand from his hand
 is praayshchit ke saath ve papamukt maane gaye
 The BJP wants to wash the shameful defeat of Bihar and Delhi on the land of Brahmaputra by sticking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's organizational hero Shah on similar lines
 shah ne dobaaraa adhyaksh banane ke baad sabase pehle assam par hi nigahen gadaayin or purvottar main apni sarkaar banane kaa khaakaa bun daalaa
 Two days after he was elected president, when the country was celebrating Republic Day, Shah was in a tizzy over Assam's strategy
 26 janvari ko hi unhone assam bijepi ke adhyaksh or kendriya khel tathaa yuva maamalon ke mantri sarbanand sonoval samet rajya se jude tamaam ranneetikaron kii baithak 28 janvari ko hone vaali sansadeey board kii baithak se pehle bula lee
 Sonowal left Delhi on the night of 27, leaving the scheduled government program organized by Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan in Bongaigaon
 assam se jude party ranneetikaron&rashtriya sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal, chunaav prabharee ram madhav, kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan, prabharee mahendra singh or sonoval ke saath 28 janvari kii subah kareeb teen ghante chali baithak main shah ne mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar or sambhavit gathbandhanon ko lekar gahan mantranaa kii
 When it was agreed to make Sonowal a candidate, the question arose as to when to announce it? According to sources, Shah immediately said that "there is a meeting of the Parliamentary Board this evening, where the Prime Minister will also be there
" aaj hi sonoval ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit kar dete hai
 "the bjp's decision to pursue the local leadership in Assam was not easy, as it jumped on the Narendra Modi wave in the assembly elections till Sarbananda Sarvesarva Ab
 lekin bihar or dilli kii haar kii tis shah ke jehan main thi
 It was only after the Bihar debacle that the party made an intention to pay attention to the local leadership, under which signs were given to project the chief minister by making Sonowal the state president and head of the election campaign committee in Assam
 lekin rajya ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ne jab assam chunaav main apana muqabla modi se bataaya to bihar main haath jala chuki bijepi ko laga ki isse mushkil ho sakati he
 In Delhi too, the party had seen the fate of not being able to convince its people by projecting outside candidate Kiran Bedi instead of the organization at the last moment
 isliye shah ne chunavi sargarmi badaae se pehle hi sonoval ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kaa faisla le liya taaki chunaav modi kii bajaae sonoval banaam gogoi main tabdeel ho jaae
 The 52-year-old Sonowal's image of a clean and energetic leader and his popularity also eased the BJP leadership's decision
 modi-shah yugin bijepi ke 19 maheene ke kaarykaal main yah pehla ranneetik shift he
 According to sources, Prime Minister Modi will not have rallies like Assam in Bihar
 party ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, “rajya main modi kii kam se kam reliyaan karaane kii soch he, kyonki chunaav main sthaneey netritv ko aage badhanaa hi hamaari ranneeti he
 "modi has made his election debut on January 19 from the joint rally of Bodo People's front-bjp in Kokrajhar
 party kii ranneeti modi se un ilaakon main prachaar karaane kii he jahaan kaa saamaajik sameekaran bijepi ke liye mufeed he
 In the Hindu and tribal polarization Bihar, the BJP has adopted a very strict strategy in Assam, in front of the social equation that emerged from the nitish-lalu-congress grand alliance
 use andeshaa tha ki congress assam main ol india united democratic front (eiudief) ke saath milakar mahagathbandhan bana sakati he, lekin aisa nahin hua
 a senior BJP strategist explains, “we did not allow Bihar to make a mistake here
 agar congress-eiudief kaa gathbandhan ho jaataa to bihar jaisi sthiti ho jaati
 Even before the Congress, we started trying to bring together all the tribal parties Raba, Missing, Karbi, Dimasa, Tiwa etc
 including Bodo People's Front (BPF), Assam Gana Parishad (AGP)
 bipief ke saath gathbandhan ho chukaa he, baakiyon se baatcheet jari he
 "assam has the highest Muslim population at 34 percent after Jammu and Kashmir
 isliye party bangladeshi hindu sharnaarthi, asmi hindu, sabhi janajaatiy samoohon or chaay bagan se jude saamaajik tabakon kaa guladasta banane kii disha main teji se bad rahi he
 Apart from this, the change in the guidelines required to meet that demand is being considered very actively for the six major ethnic groups of the state including the Ahoms, who are currently in the category of OBC and are demanding tribal status
 bijepi netaa maanate hai ki chunaav kii adhisuchana jari hone se pehle centre sarkaar kii ore se is maang par nirnaayak pahal ho jaaegi
 Encouragement, but not less challenge The BJP, which had the highest number of votes in Assam in the Lok Sabha elections, was boosted when it won a landslide victory in the February 2015 local election results
 assam main 34 board or 42 toun cametiyaan hai
 Of the 477 wards on the board, the BJP won 228 seats and captured 23 boards
 42 toun cametiyon ke 269 vaardon main se bijepi 135 main jiti or 28 cametiyaan jeet leen
 After this victory, the BJP formulated a legislative framework and targeted 69 assembly seats and 23 seats in second place on the basis of Lok Sabha elections
 shuruyaat main party ne mishan-84 kaa lakshya rakhaa, lekin ram madhav ne chunaav prabharee kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad ise hataakar sabhi 126 siton kaa lakshya banaaya
 The party has placed 80 seats in the a category, while 10-15 seats are in the b plus category
 assam main badhate janaadhar se utsahit bijepi ne assam nirmaan naam se ek abhiyaan shuru kiya he jisamen modi sarkaar ke tamaam mantriyon ko rajya kaa daura kar kiye gaye kaamon ko ginane or janata se feedback lekar vijan dastavej taiyaar karne kii ranneeti he
 State in-charge Mahendra Singh says, "the Modi government has done a lot of work for Assam in the last 19 months with running three trains, notification for Hindu refugees, Operation All Out in Kokrajhar, sneaking into Myanmar and wiping out militants
 ye kuch aise kaam hai jisase rajya main maahaul bana he ki bijepi aegi to assam surakshit rahegaa
 "like the 2005 elections of Bihar in Assam, the party will raise the voice of Jungle Raj for 15 years and put the Congress government's Tarun Gogoi in the dock
 jisamen unhen haal hi main congress chhodkar bijepi main aae hemanth biswa sarama se kaaphi ummid he
 But the bjp's biggest challenge is the promises made during the Lok Sabha elections
 usne satta main aane par bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko waapas bhejne kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin aaj tak us par amal nahin hua
 Similarly, the assurance of not giving an inch of land in Assam was given, but in the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh, several acres of the state's land was taken away
 lekin isse bephikr bijepi modi ke vikaas or surakshit assam kaa vaada kar rahi he
 The party as a local leadership will fully redeem the image of Sonowal who himself comes from the Kachari tribal community
 sonoval ke mantralay ke tahat aane vaale nehru yuva centre sanghathan ne to sanshodhan kar apana kaaryakshetra chaatro ke bich bhi badha diya he
 Which has been started from Assam
 sanghathan ke sadsy dinesh pratapsingh kaa kahana he, “ab tak yuva chaatro ke bich silchar, naugaanv, lakhimpur, dibrugarh, bongigaanv or guwahati ko milakar 6 youth conklev ho chuke hai
 The organization and the family mustaidbjp claims that its membership in the state has increased from 3,51,000 to 30 lakh
 sanghathan ke lihaaj se party ne assam ko 36 jilon main baant rakhaa he
 In November itself 126 senior leaders were sorted and given the responsibility of creating booths, out of which booths have been set up in 118 assembly constituencies, but in some Muslim areas the party has not been successful
 har booth par kam se kam 20 sadsy rakhe gaye hai
 In terms of organization, BJP has formed a team from the assembly to the panchayat level
 assam main sangh parivaar kaa role kaaphi ahm he or is chunaav ke liye parivaar main jabardast samanvay he
 State BJP organization ministers are constantly in touch with local union leaders, while strategists posted by the central leadership also do weekly consultations with regional pracharak, co-zonal pracharak and prant pracharak
 shah ke mantra “har haal main assam jeetna he” ke saath bijepi ne sanghathan, sarkaar-sangh ke str par chunaav kaa blueprint taiyaar kar liya he
 But by conquering Assam in the lap of the Brahmaputra river, Shah wants to respond to the opponents inside and outside the party, that wide shaped river has a different nature
 darasal brahmaputra ek mahanad he jo garajte hue behad tej raftaar se bahata he, aise main dekhnaa hoga ki bijepi apni do paraajayon kii kasak mitaane ke liye is pavitra nadi main dubkee lagane main kaamyaab hogi yaa phir uskaa tej bahaav use bihar-dilli kii raah le jayega

 At the same time, senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma termed the government's permission for foreign mps to visit Kashmir as "national embarrassment" and said those responsible should be held accountable
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne kaha ki sarkaar ko europea saansadon ko anumati dene se pehle vipaksh ke saansadon ko jammu kashmir jane dene kii anumati deni chahie thi

 unhen dar tha ki ve us maahaul main rah nahin kar paaenge or pakistani un par bharosa nahin karenge
 Shantanu rejected the news and pleas that 'no promise was made about the punishment', saying that the CBI had made a promise like leaving Jacob in exchange for information about Netiger and Dawood Ibrahim
 unhone kaha, 'hamanen unhen bharat kii nyaay vyavastha main kaa bharosa dilaayaa

 BJP leader said - Leave the chair for BJP in Bihar created a fierce reaction to the statement of nitishbjp leader Sanjay Paswan

 There have been several occasions since differences between the two parties came to light after the estrangement started on the issue of stake in 0 and later jdu's decision to stay out of the government
 ab to bijepi ke varisht netaa, nitish kumaar kii kursi par bhi nigaah laga baithe hai
 Former Union Minister and senior BJP leader Sanjay Paswan has asked Nitish to leave the Chief Minister's chair and Bihar's politics and move towards the center
 bhaajapa ke emelsi sanjay paswan ne bihar main nitish kii jagah modi model kii baat uthaakar siyaasi halchal paidaa kar di
 Paswan said that Nitish Kumar gave a chance to Jitan Ram Manjhi, now BJP should also give a chance
 hameshaa bijepi dipti hi kyon rahe
 However, Sanjay Paswan also said that bjp's claim to the post of Chief Minister would not affect the alliance
 is bayaan ke jariye sanjay paswan ne mukhyamantri pad par bijepi kii daavedaari pesh kar di
 It is believed that BJP wants Nitish Kumar to lay siege to the party's face in the state, Nityanand Rai, and Sushil Modi's future
 haalanki party ke kuch netaa ise bijepi nahin balki sanjay paswan kii nijee raay bhi maanate hai
 Why are repeated clashes say that BJP is excited with the NDA getting 39 out of 40 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ko lag rahaa he ki modi ke naam par ab janata jholii bhar rahi he
 On the other hand, despite being in alliance, JDU has been opposing the BJP from outside Parliament on various issues
 chaahe teen talaak kaa masalaa ho, ram mandir ho yaa maujuuda samay enarasi kaa mudda
 In the Rajya Sabha too, JDU had shown a rebellious stand on the issue of triple talaq
 sutron kii maane to gathbandhan ke andar se hi apane mudde ke khilaaf aawaaj uthne par bijepi asahaj ho jaati he
 In such a situation, BJP is now preparing to bring Nitish under pressure due to the siege of statements
 jadyu ne kaha- janata banaati he siembijapi netaa sanjay paswan kii ore se bihar main nitish nahin modi model kii baat kiye jane par jadyu netaa sanjay singh ne karaara nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He has said that the Narendra Modi model will run in Bihar, but what happened in 2015 also needs to be seen

 Clapper said that India has substantially increased its engagement with Afghanistan in 2011, but in the near future it is not going to send troops or heavy equipment to Afghanistan, as it does not want to provoke Pakistan
 ' claper ne kaha ki bharat kaa vyapak judaav antarrashtriya suraksha sahaayta bal (ieseef) kii maujuudagi or uske chale jane ke baad bhi afghanistan kii samprabhutaa or swatantraaa banaae rakhane main vahaan kii sarkaar ko madad karne par lakshith he
