 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko ek bada faisla sunaaya he
 The court said that during the investigation into the criminal case, the police cannot seize any immovable property
 lekin chal sampatti ko fries karne par koi roak nahin he
 The decision of three judges with the consent of Section 102 of CRPC was given by this judgment
 maamla jaanch ke dauraan police dwaara sampatti jabt karne ke sambandh main aapraadhik prakriya samhita yani crpc kii 102 kii shaktiyon se sambandhit he
 The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court, in a majority judgment, held that the police had no power to confiscate the property during the investigation
 maharashtra sarkaar ne yah kehete hue is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di thi ki sarvocch adaalat ke tapas niyogi main faisle ke anusaar police bank khaaton ko fries kar sakati he
 In the same way police can seize property related to crime
 lekin sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court rajya kii in daleelon se sahamat nahin kyonki uskaa maananaa tha ki isse police dwaara apni shakti kaa durupyog ho saktaa he
 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 There is no solution by creating a fuss
 phir bhi do ghatnaon ke bich agar koi chiz nirantar he to ghamaasan hi he
 Look at all the debates happening on all kinds of forums
 paanch disambar ko ubar kii taxi main hui balaatkaar kii ghatana ke baad samaaj or system thik vaise hi jaagaa he jaise 16 disambar 2012 kii ghatana ke baad jaagaa tha
 The lack of stringent legislation was then detected, which was rectified in record time, but now deficiencies such as GPS, CCTV verification and licensing are being identified
 jis mobile ap ko ham nae jamaane ke gavarnence ke rambaan kii tarah prachaarit kar rahe the uski is maamle main dhol pit chuki he
 The record of Uber taxi driver states that he is facing a variety of criminal cases
 mainpuri main ek balaatkaar kaa maamla bhi chal rahaa he, jisamen vah zamaanat par baahar he
 Despite being arrested several times, the court has not convicted him
 aisi hi sthiti main koi saansad hota to raajnneetik dal se lekar pradhanmantri tak uske nirdosh hone kii vakaalat kar rahe hote
 You can be an MP, but not a driver, due to pending lawsuits
 zaahir he hamen sawaalon ko thik jagah rakhana padegaa
 Everything will not be done by delhi-delhi, institutions will have to be changed in Mainpuri and Mathura too
 agar company ne aaropee shiv kumaar yadav kii jaanch karai bhi hoti, to kya guarantee isamen farjivada nahin ho jaataa
 Many people also question the verification of Delhi Police
 dilli police veriphication kaa form lekar registry se duusare rajya kii police ko bhej detii he
 Many times mistakes are also made, but if the police of any police station of that state does not give the correct information, then the Delhi Police has no choice
 zaruri nahin ki aaropee kaa record us thane main hi mili jahaan kaa vah rahane vaala ho
 Private companies in Delhi also get their employees verified
 vah ek chitthee dekar aapako disipi daftar main bhej detii hai, jahaan dhai sau rupee kii ek parchi cat jaati he
 The Modi government has ended the system of verification
 ab to aapako khud hi satyapit karnaa he
 The problem was also in that old system, the problem can also be in this new system
 dilli prashasan ne izi cab, mega cab, meru cab, chanson cab, yo cab or air cab ko chhod kar internet se sanchalit sabhi taxi companiyon ko band kar diya he
 The Home Minister has suggested the same to other states
 pichley dinon landan, madrid, berlin or paris ke taxi drywaron ne ubar ke khilaaf pradasharn bhi kiya, kyonki yah company kathith rup se suraksha beemaa or license ke niyamon kaa thik se paalan nahin karti he
 Because of these shortcomings, Thailand has also shut down Internet companies
 bharat main bahes ho rahi he ki railgadee main balaatkaar hoga to kya rail band kar denge
 Some people are saying that it has happened
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki radio taxi ne mahanagaron main raat−biraat akele chalane vaali kaamgaar mahilaon ko ek behatar vikalp diya he
 Being a corporate equipped with GPS and SMS system will also create a sense of security
 ubar ghatana se pehle aap in texiyon main chalane vaali mahilaon se puuchhenge to unka anubhav thik thaak se lekar behatar tak milegaa
 Now the confidence of many is shaken
 mumbai police ne kaha he ki vah kaali-pili radio taxi, mobile ap aadhaarit taxi kii ginati karaayegi
 There will be police verification of all drivers
 bengalooru police ne bhi veriphication kaa faisla kiya he
 All these decisions are correct and should have been done earlier
 jab inaki kaaren mahanagaron kii sadakon par daud rahi thim tab parivahan se lekar grih mantralay tak kahaan the
 While this model was being praised in one or the other newspaper
 aap kis had tak veriphication karenge
 There is a small issue but how big a question has become
 achaanak kai log nukkad ke taxi stand ko lekar itnaa centi ho gaye hai ki bhul gaye hai ki in taxi stand ke kai drywaron kaa bhi veriphication nahin hota he


 kya bain kar dene bhar se is samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 Why should one driver be punished for the other drivers? The matter is with the Transport Ministry and the Home Ministry is taking the decision
 jabaki grahamantri rajnath singh ko parivahanmantri nitin gadakari se poochna chahie tha, aap kya kar rahe hai
 Gadkari had said to end the post of RTO as soon as he came, what happened to him
 licencing kii vyavastha main kya sudhaar hua he
 After the Nirbhaya incident, we increased the number of PCR vans
 GPS was also installed in a large number of autos and buses
 It is true that all the vehicles could not install GPS, installed cctvs, yet the number of rapes in Delhi did not decrease
 thik he ki ladkiyaan ab is ghatana kii reporting karne lagi hai lekin kya yahi daleel mukammal he
 The number of rapes has not decreased, why is this not a question and whose failure is it
 sawaal sirf drywaron kaa hi nahin auraton ko ek vishwasaneey parivahan vyavastha bhi dene kaa bhi he
 a total of 12 people, including a pastor, have been questioned so far in the case of raping five girls at gunpoint in Khunti district, adjoining Jharkhand's capital Ranchi
 khunti police ne ek aaropee kaa sketch bhi jari kiya he
 Also, a reward of 50 thousand rupees has also been announced to the person who gives the address of this person
 vahiin, rashtriya mahila ayog ne jharkhand ke police mahanideshak ko patr likhakar puure maamle kii vistrut report dene ke liye kaha he
 The commission has formed a three-member team to investigate the matter
 ayog ne kaha ki yah team puure maamle kii jaanch karegi
 The Ranchi police said that five girls who had come out to participate in the awareness campaign on behalf of the NGO have been questioned by 12 people including Ekpadri in the rape case and about half a dozen people have been detained

 Two days ago, the victim girls came to a street theater in this remote village where they were abducted and gang raped by Patthalgadi supporters
 peedit ladakiyon ke saath gaye NGO ke purush sadasyon ke saath marpet bhi kii gi
 Police brought a peg station to the late evening of Friday to ask the father of the Kochang College
 dushkarm maamle main fadar par police ko sahyog nahin karne or ghatana kii jaankaree nahin dene kaa aarope he
 However, the clergyman was left to PR Bond after questioning
 philhal is maamle main paanch mahilaon or ek purush kaa 164 ke tahat bayaan darj kar liya gaya he or peeditaaon kaa medical team gathan kar medical jaanch bhi kara liya gaya he

 bharat daure par aae pakistani grih mantri ne captain saurav kaaliya par aapattijanak bayaan dene ke baad bhale hi baad main afsos jataa diya ho lekin pakistan kii hukumat bhartiya sena ke bare main kisi soch rakhti he, ye to jaahir ho hi gaya tha
 In fact, the gruesome treatment of Indian soldiers after firing on the loc is reminiscent of the martyr Sourav Kalia of Kargil
 jaahir he rahamaan malik apni hi fouj kii kaayar or barbar harakat par muhar nahin laga sakate lekin mangalvaar ko elocy par hui ghatana ne padosi kii naa-paak karatuut ko phir se beparda jarur kar diya he
 In the Kargil war of 1999, the Pakistani army arrested and tortured Captain Sourav Kalia and handed over his mutilated body to India
 saurav kaaliya ke pita abhi bhi is besharm or amanviya harakat ke doshiyon ko sajaa dilaane ke liye ladaai lard rahe hai
 Pakistan's treatment of Captain Kalia is also a violation of the Geneva Agreement on Prisoners of War
 lekin padosi apni kathani or kerani main samanta nahin rakhata
 a miracle will happen if Pakistan starts doing what it says
 na to shahid saurav kaaliya ke maamle main or na hi elosi par shahid hue in do javaanon kii ghatana main paak apni ore ungali dikhayega

 The Prime Minister is taking the credit for better cleanliness and arrangement in Kumbh Mela with loud noise

 Sangam garbage is currently growing as a mountain of garbage in a dumping ground in Baswara village, about twenty km from Allahabad

 Councilor Anand Ghildiyal alias Aanu Plant from Colonelganj, Allahabad, says that there are garbage piles of Kumbh in large plastic pages
 elahabaad ko smart city dikhaaya ja rahaa he lekin iske kooday ko chipaaya ja rahaa he
 Anand says that the scam of crores of rupees is being done with the collusion of the waste management company and the officials
 kai baar nigam main ye mudda uthaaya gaya lekin kisi ke kaan par jun tak nahin reng rahi he
 Anand says that the waste coming out of Kumbh Mela and the city of Allahabad was to be made of plastic granules and manure here, but the machinery for this is also turning into a garbage by getting rust and spider web
 darasal kumbh meley or elahabaad kaa kooda prabandhan karne kii jimmedaari ek nijee company kii he lekin yahaan mashine kharaab padi he

 In the case of two government bungalows of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the Supreme Court said that if there are two bungalows with the Chief Minister, what is the harm in this? One for living in a bungalow and the other for government work
 court ne kaha- mukhyamantri ke paas bahut kaam hote hai, bahut saare log milane aate hai iske liye agar daftar ke kaam ke liye doosraa bangala liya gaya he to kya galat he? is tarah to jajon ke paas bhi do hisse hote hai ek sachivalay or ek awaas
 However, the Supreme Court said that elections are to be held in UP, so the matter will be heard in April after the election
 darasal, lok prahari sanghathan ne supreme court ne janhit yachika kii thi
 In the petition, Akhilesh was challenged to give five bungalows on Kalidas Marg and a government bungalow on four Vikramaditya Marg
 isse pehle november main lakhanu hoicourt ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko badi raahat dete hue unhen doosraa bangala aavantit kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The bench had said that a bungalow already allotted by the Chief Minister is also being used as an office where many people would obviously come to meet
 aise main parivaar kii niztaa kaa hanan hota hoga
 Therefore, allocation of second bungalow is not a subject in which the court intervenes
 tippaniyan The petition said that the Chief Minister was asked to allot the bungalow of 4 Kalikas Marg and 4 Vikramaditya Marg, beyond the UP Ministers (salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act - 1981
 esen shukla ne court ko tark diya tha ki ukt adhinium main isi saal sanshodhan karte hue yah aavanton isliye bhi kiya gaya he taaki mukhyamantri ke kaaryamukt hone ke baad bhi bangala unke paas bana rahe
 At the same time, the government argued that since 1985, the practice of allocating two bungalows to the Chief Minister is going on in the state
 yachika main mukhyamantri ko prativaadee sankhya 2 banaakar 5 kalidaas maarg ke alaava ek anya bangala aavantit karne sambandhi aadesh nirast karne kii maang kii gai thi
 In fact, the Public Interest Litigation was filed by the Lok Sentinel Organization by the Supreme Court
 yachika main akhilesh ko paanch kalidaas maarg ke bangale ke alaava chaar vikramaditya maarg par sarkari bangala dene ko chunauti di gai thi
 Earlier in November, the Lucknow High Court gave a major relief to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and dismissed the petition challenging the allotment of a second bungalow to him
 bench ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri dwaara pehle se aavantit ek bangale ko karyaalay ke taur par bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan jaahir taur par bahut se log milane aate honge
 In such a situation the privacy of the family must have been violated
 lihaaja duusare bangale kaa aavanton aisa vishay nahin jisamen court hastkshep kare
 The comments yachika main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko 5 kalidaas maarg ke alaava 4 vikramaditya maarg ke bangale kaa aavanton upi ministars (vetan, bhatte or prakeern upbandh) adhinium- 1981 se pare jaakar kiya janaa bataaya gaya
 SN Shukla had argued to the court that the amendment in the said Act this year has been done so that the bungalow remains with him even after the Chief Minister is relieved
 vahiin sarkaar kaa tark tha ki 1985 se hi pradesh main mukhyamantri ko do bangale aavantit kiye jane kii pratha chali aa rahi he
 The petition sought repeal of the order to allot another bungalow besides 5 Kalidas Marg by making the Chief Minister as the respondent no
 isse pehle november main lakhanu hoicourt ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko badi raahat dete hue unhen doosraa bangala aavantit kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika khaarij kar di thi

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) India's new Test captain Virat Kohli said in Sydney on Monday that when he leads the team in the fourth and final cricket Test which starts here tomorrow, he will be patient in difficult conditions and try to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 
 kohli ne dhoni kii sanyas kii ghoshnaa par kaha, ‘‘ham melbern test ke baad dressing rup main kapade badal rahe the or apana saamaan samet rahe the jab dhoni aayaa or kehane laga ki vah kuch kahana chahta he
 After this he announced his decision and we all came into the can
 yah sab itnaa jaldi main hua ki kuch samaj main nahin aayaa
 We did not expect this and it was shocking for us
 ’’ He said, "we didn't know what to say because it was a very emotional moment for him
 hamaare liye bhi jinhone uski captaini main yuva ke taur par shuruyaat kii, yah kaaphi ajeeb lamhaa tha
 '' kohli ne dhoni kii tarif karte hue kaha, ‘‘usase seekhney ke liye kaaphi kuch tha visheshkar mushkil halaat main, uskaa dhairya or ahm lamhon par uske faisle lene kii kshamta
 These things are priceless and any captain would like to be so in himself
 ummid karata hum ki main bhi uski tarah dhairyavan ban paaungaa
 '' dhoni kii anguli kii chot ke kaaran edilade ovel main pehle test main kaaryvahak captain kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale kohli ne donon pariyon main shatak jadaa tha or bharat ko jeet ke kareeb le gaye the, lekin team ko 48 ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, Kohli said that the top-order batsmen are ready to learn from their mistakes
 edilade testbeshak bharat haar gaya ho lekin yah match hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye itihaas ke pannon main darj ho gaya
 India's batting captain Virat Kohli has batted like never before
 bataur test captain debyue karte huekohli donon pariyon main shatak banaaya
 Earlier, Greg Chappell of Australia has also done this feat
 lekin kohli ne unako bhi peeche chhod diya
 Chappell scored 123 and 109 (232) in both innings of a match against West Indies in 1975
 kohli ne unako peeche chhodte hue 115 or 141 (256) ranon kii pari kheli or debyue captain ke rup main sabase zyada ran banane kaa record bana daalaa
 The aggression that once featured in Sourav Ganguly as captain, is the same aggression now seen in Kohli
 ab se pehle maansik or jubaani jang main aksar bhartiya khilaadi kangaaroon se haarate hue dikhe the, lekin kohli ne ek nae yug kii shuruyaat kar di
 The regression with which Kohli supported his players as captain was really worth watching
 david warner or steven smith jab bhartiya khilaadiyon se uljhe to kohli ne fouran bich main aakar unako apane had main rahane kii naseehat de daali
 Kohli proved not only with his tongue but also with his performance that he is not mentally weaker than the Kangaroos
 haalanki kai log kohli ke is aakraamak swabhaav ko test match haarane ke liye bhi jimmedaar maanate hai
 Many would believe that if it had not been so aggressive, the Test match could have been a draw
 un logon ke liye kohli kaa sidhaa sa jawaab tha ki paanch din kaa cricket khilne ke baad aap drow ke liye nahin jeet ke liye khelte hai
 Kohli has a point in this too as the glow of Test matches has faded due to the arrival of T20, so if something can really help in keeping Test cricket alive then it is such exciting match
 
 
 
 
 jab maaikel clark ko kohli main dikhi tendulkar kii jhalkedilade test ke baad australia ke captain maaikel clark ne kaha ki jo khatra hamen sachin tendulkar se mahasoos hota tha vahi aaj kohli se ho rahaa he
 The strategy that we used to make Sachin out, the same has to be made to take Kohli's wicket today
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah kii mushkil condishan main kohli ne ballebaaji karte hue lagbhag bharat ko jeeta diya tha, vaaki unhone aaj apana class dikhaa diya
 Kohli said i like the style of Australians, say iron cuts iron only
 match jeetne ke liye australian khilaadi aksar sledging kaa sahaara lete rahe hai
 As the series progresses, the heat will increase here
 idhar viraat kohli ne bhi kah diya he ki unhen australia kaa cricket khilne kaa andaaj pasand he
 In gestures, Kohli has made it clear that if the Kangaroos tried to cross the limit, they would not be left behind
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne bhaajapa netaa narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne rajya main garibon ke liye 50,000 makaan banane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin pichley 11 saal main 50 makaan bhi nahin banaae gaye hai

 ' madhya pradesh ke muraina jile main march 2012 main kathith taur par khanan mafia ke ek sadsy ne yuva ipies adhikari singh ko ek tractor-trollies se kuchalakar maar daalaa tha
 Singh was crushed when he tried to stop the tractor-trolley
 modi ko aade haath lete hue kejariwal ne kaha, 'bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne gujarat main garibon ke liye 50,000 makaan banane kaa vaada kiya tha par 11 saal main 50 makaan bhi nahin banaae gaye
 ' iske alaava kejariwal ne basapa or sapa ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki uttar pradesh main sarkaar badalane se koi badlaav nahin aata, kyonki donon hi 'bhrashtachar ke paryaay' ban gaye hai
 He targeted the Congress for inflation and corruption and described both the problems as a result of the Congress policy of 'promoting' the interests of big business houses

 PM Narendra Modi fiercely attacked NCP President Sharad Pawar in Wardha, Maharashtra while addressing an election rally in view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 maharashtra ke wardha main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki ek samay tha jab sharad pavaar sochate the ki wo bhi pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 He also announced that he will contest this election
 lekin achaanak ek din bole ki nahin, main to yahaan rajyasabha main hi khush hum, main chunaav nahin laduunga
 Sharad Pawar ji also knows where the wind is facing
 piem modi ne kaha ki sharad pavaar sahab desh ke sabase varisht auki anbhavi netaaon main se ek rahe hai
 They do not do any work without thinking
 piem modi ne sharad pavaar par vanshavaad kii raajnneeti karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said that due to the promotion of dynastic politics by Sharad Pawar , most NCP leaders are finding it easier to get 'retired hurt'
 piem mod ne kaha ki ab aaj pavaar sahab ko logon ne hi bold kar diya he
 Taking a dig at Sharad Pawar, PM Modi said that his lies, his false promises have been exposed, and he himself has been hit-and-wicket by the nephew
 khud ek kisaan hone ke baavjood sharad pavaar kisaanon ko bhul gaye, unki chintaaon ko bhul gaye
 PM Modi said that during his tenure, many farmers were forced to commit suicide, but Pawar saheb did not care
 piem modi ne kaha ki sharad pavaar kaa dhyaan kisaanon kii sthiti par tha hi nahin
 He also reminded the waste used by Sharad Pawar's nephew for the farmers of Maharashtra
 piem modi ne kaha ki mat bhuuliye, jab maharashtra kaa kisaan ajit pavaar se baandhon main pani ke bare main sawaal karne gaya tha to unhen kya jawaab mila tha
 Don't forget, when the farmers of Maval were fighting for their rights, the Pawar family ordered them to shoot at them
 piem modi ne kaha ki paise kii ye bhukh mitaane ke liye sinchai, stamp, real-estate, sadak pariyojnaayen, sarkari tender, jahaan se ban padataa he, jaise ban padataa he, karodon-arabon rupee jutaaye jate hai
 The alliance of Congress and NCP in Maharashtra is like Kumbhkaran
 jab wo satta main hote hai to 6-6 maheene ke liye sote hai
 In 6 months, one wakes up and after eating public money, goes to sleep
 pavaar parivaar ke log isi baat par maathapai kar rahe hai ki koun si siton se laden, kahaan chhod den
 Because of this the patience of others is also running out
 piem modi ne kaha ki unki ek samasya ye bhi he ki ensipi main is samay bahut bada paariwarik yuddh chal rahaa he
 The party is getting out of his hands and the situation is that Pawar Saheb's nephew is slowly occupying the party
 isi vajah se NCP ko tikat bantwaare main bhi dikkat aa rahi he
 Pakistan again ceases firefighting firing in Mendhar sector of Poonch; Pakistan is also using mortar guuruuvaar subah 11
 The ceasefire was broken by Pakistan at Mendhar sector of Poonch district at 30 am
 pichley kuch dinon se pakistan lagaataar aisa kar rahaa he, lekin bharat ke jawan har baar use munhtod jawaab de rahe hai
 Please tell that today Pakistan has also tested one of its ballistic missiles
 guuruuvaar subah pakistan kii taraf se mendhar main mortar daage gaye or golibari kii gai he
 It is worth noting that before Mendhar, firing has been done in the last few days from the Pakistan side in Poonch district itself
 haalanki, har baar pakistan ko munh kii khaani padati he or tab jaakar vah shant hota he
 Ten Pakistan soldiers who were killed in 3 weeks, the Government of India had decided to weaken Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir on 5 August
 tabhi se pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he or apana gussa border par utaar rahaa he
 But Pakistan is facing this, because during the firing in the last three weeks, Indian soldiers killed 10 Pakistan soldiers
 bharat ke javaanon ne ye ection javaabi karrwai main liya he
 Let us know that Pakistan is being defeated diplomatically everywhere on this issue, neither the United Nations nor big countries like us-russia are listening to its plea to interfere in Kashmir
 isliye pakistan lagaataar is tarah ke kadam uthaa rahaa he, jisase duniya kaa dhyaan is ore aa sake
 Pakistan on one side is breaking the ceasefire on the border, on the other hand Pakistan has tested ballistic missile
 is missile ko pakistan ne gaznavi kaa naam diya he

 dilli main sasti bijli par aaj koi faisla nahin hoga
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is suffering from fever, cough and diarrhea, has not called a meeting of power officials
 atakalein thim ki kejariwal aaj apane ghar par hi bijli adhikariyon kii baithak le sakate hen or maamle par bada faisla bhi aaj hi aa saktaa he
 But this is no longer expected

 According to sources, DERC is not in favor of cutting electricity rates
 aise main agar sarkaar chaahe to dilli kii janata ko baari sabsidi de sakati he
 Subsidies will put a huge burden on the state exchequer
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, sarkaar ne agar bijli kii dar aadhi kam kar di to salanaa 5000 karod kaa boj khajaane par bad jayega
 Perhaps this is the reason why now Kejriwal government is considering giving 50 percent relief on electricity bill to only those people who use 400 units of electricity every month
 aasaan nahin hogafaislagauratlab he ki apane ghoshnaptr main aam aadmi party ne bijli ke daam 50 fisadi ghataane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But according to experts, giving a gift of cheap electricity like water will not be easy for Chief Minister Kejriwal

 It is also against the law and the Supreme Court has given its verdict on it
 'muft pani kaa elaan kar chuki he AAP sarkarisase pehle somvaar ko ek behad ahm faisle main kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli ke har parivaar ke liye maheene main 20 hajaar litre muft pani kaa elaan kiya
 That is, Delhiites will not have to give even a pie on the use of 666 liters of water daily
 jal board ke nae siio vijay kumaar ne yah elaan kiya
 Currently, only those people have a water meter in their house
 is par vipaksh kii ore se aalochana bhi shuru ho gai he
 Former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit's son and Congress MP Sandeep Dixit termed the verdict as a juggernaut of statistics and said that it would not benefit every section of the people
 congress boli- 'gharon tak pahunchaaen pani'silampur se congress vidhayak matin ahamed ne kaha he ki dilli main sirf 9 se 10 lakh gharon main hi meter, baaki logon kaa kya hoga
 Matin Ahmed said that Kejriwal is the Chief Minister, can do anything, but implementing the scheme is a big challenge
 gauratlab he ki ek channel ke sting oparation main matin ahamed camere par yah kehete hue paae gaye the ki unki party kaa AAP ko samarthan ek drame se zyada kuch nahin he
 He had said, 'abuses are happening, but the fun is coming

 He said that in the second phase of NPR, biometric enrollment (photographs, fingerprints and images of eyeball images) will be done for all the normally residing persons of five years and above
 mukhyamantri akhilesh ne yahaan mangalvaar ko apane sarkari awaas par apana or apane parivaar kaa biometric namakan karaane ke baad is kaary main lage logon se kaha ki sabhi sambandhit vyaktiyon ko ek vishisht pahchaan sankhya (aadhaar sankhya) pradaan karne se desh evam pradesh ke liye kalyankari yojana banane evam suraksha vyavastha sudhaarney main madad milegi
 Apart from this, biometric enrollment will prove useful in making government schemes and programs accessible to the eligible people

 samay ke saath aapaki umr bhi badhati he
 But increasing age becomes a cause of trouble when its effect starts appearing on the body ahead of time
 galat khan-paan or life style ke chalate aaj dekha ja rahaa he ki log kam umr main hi aisi bimariyon se grasit ho rahe hai jo budhaape main dastak detii hai
 You may be surprised to know that India has the largest number of such people in comparison to other countries
 yahaan log apni kharaab dincharya or aadaton kii vajah se sharir se jaldi buudhen ho rahe hai
 Something similar has to be said about this recent study
 da lanset public health main prakashit is study ke mutabik bharat main japan or switzraland kii tulana main logon main boodhaape ke lakshan jaldi dekhe ja sakate hai
 In India, people under the age of 60 have to deal with problems that occur in Japan at the age of 70 or 75 years
 bataa den, is tarah kii study pehali baar kii gai he
 All aspects have been given special attention in this study
 is research ko karte samay global bardan of dijis se kuch aankade liye gaye
 Apart from this, cognizance was also taken on all 92 of those diseases occurring at an increasing age through dalys
 kaaphi adhyan ke baad study ke mukhya shodhakarta anjela vaai chaing ne bataaya ki lanbaa jivan ek insaan ke liye acha bhi ho saktaa he lekin kai baar yah aapke liye pareshaani kaa sabak bhi ban jaataa he
 If you are healthy then a long life will be a boon for you, but if you are suffering from many diseases then this life here can become painful for you
 study main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki jo log samay se pehle hi buudhen ho jate hai, wo apni naukari jaldi chhod dete hai or unka apane swasth par dusron kii tulana main kharch bhi pehle ke mukaable bad jaataa he
 Through this study, the researchers even claimed that it can be detected at what age the signs of aging can be seen in a person
 vaise jaankaree ke liye bataa den, bharat main bhale hi log jaldi buudhen ho rahe ho lekin unki paristhiti duusare deshon kii tulana main aaj bhi behatar he
 For example, in Papua New Guinea, the signs of aging can be seen in people at the age of 46 years

 Even before release, Salman Khan's next film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' has set a new record
 khabar he ki is film ke mujeec rhite 17 karod main beche gaye hai
 If this is true then the most expensive sold or bought music for any film is by far
 vaise bade sitaron kii filmon ke mujeec ritis kii badi-badi keemten lagati hai
 Even though the songs of the film are not very good, their rights are sold at high prices, because the music budget is big because of the big stars and promotes the songs on a large scale
 tippaniyan The film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' stars Salman Khan with Salman Khan in the lead role and music by Himesh Reshammiya
 film main kareeb nau gane honge
 Their music has also been successful whenever Suraj Barjatya and Salman Khan have come together
 'maine pyaar kiya', 'ham aapke hai koun' or 'ham saath-saath hai' kaa sangeet aaj bhi lokapriy he or shaayad yahi vajah he 17 karod kii keemat di ja rahi he film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ke sangeet ko
 By the way, the music rights of big stars movies have huge prices
 film ke gane chaahe bahut achche na hon phir bhi inke ritis oonchi keemton main beche jate hai, kyonki bade sitaron ke hone se mujeec ke prachaar kaa bajet bada hota he or bade paimaane par gaanon kaa pramotion hota he
 The comments film 'prem ratan dhan payo' main salmaan khan ke saath sonam kapur mukhya bhoomika main hai or iskaa sangeet diya he himesh reshmia ne
 The film will have about nine songs
 suraj badjatya or salmaan khan jab-jab ek saath aae hai inkaa mujeec bhi kaamyaab rahaa he
 The music of 'maine Pyaar Kiya', 'hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and 'hum Saath Saath Saath Hain' is still popular and perhaps this is the reason why the music of the film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is being given a price of 17 crores

 loksabhaa main beete 15 dinon se lagaataar hangaamaa jari he
 The proceedings of the House could not go on smoothly on a single day
 aise main bijepi ke sabase varisht netaa laal krishna adwani ne khud sadan main gatirodh khatm karaane kaa jimmaa uthaaya he
 Advani is one of the senior-most mps in the Lok Sabha and is also respected by the Leader of the Opposition
 sadan main lagaataar ho rahe hangaame se varisht bijepi netaa adwani naakhush hai
 According to media reports, in the same attempt, Advani on Thursday called the TRS MP who was creating a furore in the Lok Sabha to his seat and heard his problem
 tiares saansadon kii maang he ki telugana main bhi sarkarinaukariyon main aarakshanki seemaa ko 50 fisad se badhaayaa jaae, jaisaa praavdhaan tamilnadu jaise rajyon main kiya gaya he
 In this sequence, Advani met Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to end the deadlock and told the TRS MP that the speaker was trying his best to run the house
 haalanki is koshish ke baad bhi shuukravaar ko sadan kii kaarywahi nahin chal saki
 This is not the first time that Advani is angry at the non-functioning of the House
 saal 2016 ke sheetakaaleen satr main sadan main hangaame par adwani ne apni seat par khadey hokar kaha tha ki vah sansad sadsyta se istipha dene ke bare main soch rahe hai
 He expressed his displeasure at the speaker and the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs for not running the house
 sonia ne lagaaya tha aropbeete dinon india today conklev main upie cheirperson sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar par sansad main gatirodh khatm na karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 On the question of resolving the deadlock through negotiation, Sonia said that this is not possible with the current government because this government does not have that passion
 vaajapeyi ji kii sarkaar membaatcheet ke jariye gatirodh ko dur kiya jaataa tha
 He said that even then we were in opposition but the issues were resolved through dialogue
 adwani vaajapeyi sarkaar main up pradhanmantri rah chuke hai
 Let us know that since last Friday in Lok Sabha, notices of no-confidence motion are being given continuously against the central government, but due to the uproar, the speaker is not able to count even 50 mps supporting the motion and the proposal cannot be put up for a single day

 html charchaa to joro par he
 There is a chance - and the way too
 lagata he desh kii siyasat main'aap' jaisaa koior bhi dastak de rahaa he
 It may be blurry at the moment, but two weeks later - on April 14, this picture will appear clearer, it seems
 dekhte hampikchar abhi kitni baaki he?yogendra-prashanth ke saamne chunautiyanfarj kiijie, yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan nai party banane kii baat karte hai
 What will be different in the new party? What will be explained to the people that the new party will be different from the existing party led by Arvind Kejriwal
 kejariwal par aisa koi aarope to he nahin ki logon kaa bharosa uth chukaa ho
 Not much time has been spent to explain to the people that the promises made were not fulfilled
 le dekar un par bhagoda hone kaa ek thappa laga tha uskaa to ab naamo-nishaan tak mit chukaa he
 Those who have been removed from aap's political panel or executive say that there is no democracy in the party
 party main virdohi swar sune nahin jate
 a party was formed in the name of Lokpal and it is no longer discussed
 upar se party ke aantarik lokapal ko hi baahar kar diya - or vajah bhi nahin bataai
 But are these such big issues that the common man, the voter or supporter of Kejriwal, is worried about
 agar wo dilli ke hai to unhen bijli, pani, vaai-faai jaisi chizon se matlab he
 Similarly, in other parts of the country, the present system has boredom and expected a change
 ab un logon ko yadav, bhushan yaa duusare jo bhi unke saath khadey hon kisi behatar vikalp ke bare main kya samajhaayenge? unke liye sabase badi chunauti shaayad yahi hogi
 It is not that Yogendra Yadav is not aware of these challenges
 yadav sawaal bhi uthaate hai, 'nai raajnneeti kaa sapana dekhnaa aasaan he, use jameen par utaarna chunauti he
 This challenge is in front of me
 mujhe karke dikhaanaa he
 Sitting in Delhi, how do people decide about Odisha, Bengal and Maharashtra? 'the party will be formed, who will be the face? Let's assume that yogendra-prashant will form a new party, but who will be the face? What will be the person on whom people will show renewed confidence? Yogendra Yadav is a good scholar of political science, knows and understands politics properly
 desh bhar main unka acha network bhi he
 Similarly, Prashant Bhushan is identified as a lawyer who is directly associated with social concerns and struggles to bring reforms through the help of law
 dilli chunaavon main 'aap' kii kamyaabi jataati he ki kejariwal sirf cheharaa hi nahin hai, unamem ek chatur or jujharu rajaneta, kushal ranneetikaar or kaaryakartaaon ko motiveshan ke saath sangathit karne jaisi tamaam khubiyaan bhi hai
 As Aam Aadmi Party becomes another party
 pichhali galatiyon se sabak lekar shaayad or behatar plateform bane - lekin lakh take kaa sawaal to ye he ki naye plateform kaa kejariwal koun hoga?kya he yogendra-prashanth kii taiyaari?dilli ke constitution club main yogendra yadav kii ore se 'aap' ke walantiryas kii ek meeting bulaai ja rahi he
 Why a new party? Says Yogendra, 'this party is born of a movement and spirit and our job is to take this spirit and movement forward
 iske liye ham deshbhar se kaaryakartaaon ko bulaakar samvaad karenge or aage kya karnaa he, yah tay kiya jayega
 'it is expected that people from the disgruntled section of AAP are coming, for example - there are many people including Mayank Gandhi, Anjali Damania who have been unhappy with the way Kejriwal is
 meeting main aap ke aantarik lokapal rahe admiral el ramdaas or narmada bachaao andolan kii netaa medha patkar bhi bulaava bheja gaya he
 What are the three options? According to Prashant Bhushan, he currently has three options on which those people can proceed
 haalanki in par faisla meeting main logon se charchaa ke baad hi liya jayega
 1
 'aap' party ko kejariwal or unke samarthakon se bachaane ke liye chunaav ayog yaa court kaa darwaja khatkhataya ja saktaa he
 2
 raajnneetik taur par aisa kuch khadaa karnaa jo un makasad or siddhanton ko sahejane main sakasham ho jiske liye 'aap' kaa gathan hua
 3
 naye raajnneetik dal ke bajaay jan andolan ko aage badhaayaa jaae - or bhoomi adhikaar, system main badlaav jaisi baton ke liye sangharsh kiya jaae jisamen kaaryakartaaon kii sakaraatmak urja kaa istemaal ho sake
 Kejriwal also needed a face to launch the movement as the foundation of the Aam Aadmi Party
 raman magsese aword se sammanit or soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke liye sangharsh kii badaulat kejariwal kii ek apni pahchaan thi
 Yet these were inadequate to connect the general public to the movement and to gain a place
 tab kejariwal ne andolan khadaa karne ke liye anna ko aage kiya
 Kejriwal himself emerged as a face in the changing situation
 ab nayaa kejariwal koun hoga? kya khud yogendra-prashanth honge, yaa phir se anna honge yaa koi or? jo samasya kisi daur main kejariwal ke saamne thi, takreeban usee sthiti main aaj yogendra or prashanth bhi hai

 aisa isliye kyonki singer guru randhaava ne yah khulaasa kar diya ki vah karanvir bohara kii film hamen tumse pyaar kitna kaa gaanaa kaa gaanaa manamohini nahin gaanaa chaahate the
 It is known that Karanvir Bohra has made a big screen debut with the film Hum Tumse Pyaar Kisa
 film pichley shuukravaar box offis par relies ho chuki he
 The T-series launched Manmohini Song on social media with great enthusiasm and after a few hours all the posts were deleted
 guru randhaava kaa gaaya ye gaanaa utyub tak par uplabdh nahin he
 The film was released on Friday and after the Guru's statement came, the makers had just 4 days to re-record the song and prepare the final draft
 haalanki vah kisi tarah ise kar paane main kaamyaab rahe
 At the last minute, Micah Singh took over and he appeared as a Savior for the t-series
 tii-siries ke liye dikkat isliye bhi badi thi kyonki guru ke gaae duate song main kanika kapur kii bhi aawaaj thi
 Now it simply meant that T-series had to contact Kanika Kapoor again and re-record the songs from him as well

 None of the methods of love and pampering worked on the Guru as he was not willing to accept
 jahaan tak is bare main guru ke rispons kii baat he to unhone is maamle par ab tak koi pratikriya nahin di he
 Talking about Karanvir's film, he has done supporting and side roles in some films earlier
 kismat conection or patel kii punjabi shaadi jaisi filmon main unhone kaam kiya he or ab hamen tumse pyaar kitna main vah lead role main najar aae hai

 After Congress President Sonia Gandhi took on Anna Hazare's side, Arvind Kejriwal hoped that the Lokpal Bill would be passed in the winter session of Parliament and the government would not be limited to mere speech
 congress adhyaksh ne apni sarkaar kii ore se prabhavi or majboot lokapal vidheyak banane kaa vaada kiye jane ke baavjood is mudde par shor sharaaba karne ke liye hazaare-paksh ko aade haath lete hue kaha he ki ‘mahaj bhaashanbaaji’ karne yaa ‘dusron par ungali uthaane’ se bhrashtachar unmoolan nahin ho saktaa he
 On these comments of Sonia, Kejriwal issued a statement saying, 'we welcome Sonia Gandhi's statement
 ham puri eemaandaaree se yah ummid rakhte hai ki sarkaar majboot or prabhavi lokapal banane kii unki (sonia kii) patibaddhta kaa sammaan karegi
 
 
 Even mere speech from the government will not be enough
 ’samprag adhyaksh sonia ne uttarakhand ke gochar-chamoli main kaha, ‘sabhi yah jaanate hai ki pradhanmantri or hamaari party ne baar-baar kaha he ki ham prabhavi or majboot lokapal vidheyak ke paksh main hai
 This bill will be introduced in Parliament and we will implement it
 iske baavjood yah ho-hangaamaa kyon ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, Sanjay Singh, a member of the core committee of Hazare's movement, objected to these remarks of the Congress President and said that corruption cannot be dealt with only through speeches
 singh ne hi sonia ke nirvachan kshetra raibareli main lokapal ke mudde par surveykshan karaayaa tha
 Sanjay Singh said, 'this law is being made through struggle
 ham hamaare netaaon par pichley 42 varsh se vishwaas karte aaye hai lekin unhone kanoon nahin banaaya
 Sonia Gandhi is saying that only speeches will not do well
 in dinon netaa hi baaten karte hai lekin kaam nahin karte, yahi kaaran he ki hamen sadakon par utarana padataa he
 'they said,' If they did not work and did not pass the bill this time also, then we will have to get out on the streets again
 ’ sonia kii is tippanee par ki jab pradhanmantri aashwaasan de chuke hai to is mudde par itnaa hangaamaa kyon he, unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ke iraade sahi nahin hai
 He said, 'if their intentions were correct, they would not have brought a separate bill for redress of public grievances
 ’ a local court in Aurangabad district of Bihar rejected the bail application of Ramadhar Singh, an absconding declared absconder, in the case of making inflammatory speeches and disturbing communal harmony
 abhiyojan sutron ne bataaya ki purv sahakaarita mantri kii jamaanat arji prabharee mukhya nyaayik dandadhikari ashutosh khetaan ne khaarij kar di
 After the court surrendered, Singh filed a bail application, which was rejected
 jamaanat arji khaarij hone ke baad singh ko jail janaa pad saktaa he
 Sources said that senior BJP MLA Singh was declared absconding since 1995 by a local court in a 19-year-old case of making inflammatory speeches on the Ram temple issue
 beete dinon yah maamla sukhiryon main aane ke baad ramaadhar singh ne nitish sarkaar main sahakaarita mantri ke pad se 18 may kii raat ko istipha de diya tha, jise agle din rajyapal ne manjuur kar liya tha
 Earlier, the Patna High Court rejected Singh's bail plea and asked him to appeal before the local court

 It conveniently overlooks a big portion of Sanju's life yet is pretty precise wid mentioning the exact no

 Police said they then opened the door to another room, where the priest's family was sleeping
 vahaan unhone uski patni ke sone ke gahane lut liye or uske saath gangrape kiya
 During the hearing, Krish and Kamal declared themselves innocent and said that they were being implicated in a false case

 satyavati kii pehali shart thi ki unhen sambhog karte hue koi bhi jeev naa dekh paae
 Parashar, accepting this condition, with his divine power built an island where there was thick fog
 is kohre ke bheetar koi bhi unhen nahin dekh saktaa tha
 The other condition of Satyavati was that instead of the smell of fish coming from her body, the fragrance of flowers should come

 On the contrary, his body started smelling like flowers
 teesri shart ke rup main satyavati ne kaha ki sahavaas ke baad jab vah garbh dhaaran karegi to uskaa putr koi saamaanya vyakti nahin balki mahagyani hona chahie, naa ki ek machuaaraa
 This condition of Satyavati was also accepted by Parashar Rishi
 saath hi parashar rishi ne yah bhi vardaan diya ki sahavaas ke baad bhi unka comarya kaayam rahegaa
 Satyavati and Rishi Parashar had intercourse on a fog-filled island
 samay aane par satyavati ne ek putr ko janm diya, jo janm ke saath hi mahagyani tha

 agle saal karnataka main chunaav hone vaale hai
 It is currently one of only five states ruled by the Congress in the country
 himachal pradesh bhi un rajyon main ek he or ummid kii ja rahi he ki 9 november ko hue vidhansabha chunaav main yah bhaajapa ke paale main chalaa jayega
 Therefore, political experts can be forgiven for speculating that Karnataka elections will be very important for the realization of BJP President Amit Shah's slogan of 'congress Mukt Bharat'
 yahi vajah he ki jaankaron ko yah dekhakar koi tajjub nahin hua ki vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ne apni 'dharm sansad' kaa aayojan 1985 ke baad pehali baar karnataka main mandiron ke shahar udupi main kiya
 This gathering lasted for three days from 24 November
 32 saal baad bhi ayodhya main ram mandir kaa mudda agenda par haaavee tha
 The difference was that the VHP now believes that time is on its side
 mukhya vaktaa aresas ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne kaha, ''ram janmabhumi ko lekar koi aspashtataa nahin honi chahie ki keval ram mandir hi banegaa
 
 
 In the same look from those stones
 
 
 unheen logon ke haathon jo iske liye 20-25 saal se ladate aae hai
 He said that this is the 'only wish' of the 'hindu society'
 vihip ke adhyaksh praveen togdipha ne kaha ki ''ayodhya main ram mandir bananaa chaahate hai or bharat main ram rajya laana chaahate hai
 "he also spread misgivings by claiming that there is no 'political direction' to this conference, while almost every speaker spoke of the current atmosphere
" is dharm sansad kaa aayojan karne vaale math ke swami ne 2,000 se zyada shrotaaon ke saamne saughandh lee ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan 2019 tak kiya jayegah ''maahaul anukool he
 
 
 Based on this, i am giving this assurance
 '' bhagwat ne bhi tasdik kii, ''jeet bas najadik hi he
 "it seems that so much emphasis was given on the issue of Ram temple in an attempt to tell the fanatic Hindus again how important this issue is still
" khaskar jab 5 disambar ko supreme court ayodhya ke vivaadit sthal ko lekar elahabaad hycourt ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon par sunwaayee shuru karne ja rahaa he
 It was a kind of warning that despite the controversy going on in the court, a big crowd demolished the mosque in 1992
 2010 main hycourt ne faisla sunaaya tha ki jameen ko teen hisson main baant diya jaae or usamen se do-tihaai hisse maamle se jude hindu pakshon ko saunp die jaaen or ek tihaai sunni vakf board ko de diya jaae
 All three parties have appealed against this decision
 supreme court ne suzav diya ki sabhi paksh aapas main baatcheet karke vivaad sulajhaayen
 But it did not even begin
 udhar, shiya or sunni vakf bordon main vivaad chhid gaya
 Shia Waqf Board Chairman Syed Wasim Rizvi said that they are ready to leave the land for the temple and Muslims should build a mosque in Lucknow
 ol india muslim personal lau board or uske shiya samakaksh ne is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 This is where the entry of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of the Art of Living Foundation, takes place
 haal hi main uttar pradesh ke daure main unhone kaha ki ve is vivaad main madhyasthata kar sakate hai
 But his offer was viewed suspiciously by both Muslims and Hindus associated with the case
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne ravishankar kii koshishon ko 'bahut deree' se uthaaya gaya kadam kahkar khaarij kar diya
 What has been said in Udupi is that most Hindu groups want to settle the matter outside the court, as they believe that they are in a strong bargain
 adaalat ke faisle par to shaayad unka bas nahin he
 But VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma says, "the current reality is in favor of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, so the court's decision will be in favor of the temple
" '' agle saal march main vihip jan jaagrukta kii yojana bana rahi he
 By recommending mutual arbitration, the Supreme Court had shown reluctance to take a decision in this case, which may have various consequences
 ise shaayad tab tak taala jaataa rahegaa jab tak mumkin ho saktaa he

 She says, 'the specialty of the serpent theme is that in modern times, showing things related to tradition and roots

 China's permanent representative at the United Nations, Liu Ji, reiterated Beijing's claim that Masood Azhar, chief of Pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammed (JEM), is not a terrorist
 suraksha parishad kii aavarti adhyakshata grahan karne ke baad shuukravaar ko liyu ne kaha ki ajahar aatankwaadi ke liye nirdhaarit suraksha parishad ke maanak puure nahin karata he

 khel ke sarvshereshth finishr main shaamil dhoni ne apane 13 saal ke vanade kariyar kii sambhavat: sabase badtar pari kheli jab westeindies ke khilaaf unhone 114 gend main 54 ran banaae or team 190 ran ke lakshya ko hasil nahin kar pai
 Dhoni's innings played in North Sound undoubtedly raised some questions
 kuch sawaalon ke jawaab to cricketpremiyon ke paas maujuud hai lekin sabase mahatvapurn sawaal kaa jawaab vah swayan hi de sakate hai
 The question is whether he can win the match for India at the age of 38 in the 2019 World Cup
 iskaa jawaab sirf dhoni ke paas he
 Dhoni's struggles in batting in recent times have seen his ability as a finisher decline
 lekin agar yah poocha jaae ki kya vah ab bhi sarvshereshth wicketiper or team ke sabase feet khilaadiyon main se ek hai jo iskaa jawaab bhi nishchit taur par haa hoga
 This is a strange situation about Dhoni among the great players of India in limited overs cricket
 vah kuch match jita sakate hai, wicket ke peeche apni chapaltaa se vah shandaar hai lekin kya yah captain kohli ko samajhane ke liye paryaapt hoga ki vah britain main hone vaale worldcup se purv unhen 45 match or khilne kaa mauka de
 What goes in Dhoni's favor is India's strong batting order
 sheersh kram main kohli, rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan maujuud hai jabaki unka saath dene ke liye lokesh rahul or ajinkya rahane hai or aise main adhikansh din dhoni kii jarurat nahin padegi
 Hardik Pandya is also included in the team for batting in the final overs
 tippaniyan The problem is that the fifth and sixth order is very important in which there is not much time to stay on the wicket
 dhoni maidan par utarate hi bade chakke jadne vaale khilaadiyon main shaamil nahin rahe hai lekin ab samasya yah he ki vah ek-do ran bhi shuruyaat main niyamit taur par nahin bana rahe hai jisase dabaav ban rahaa he
 Kohli can however depend on Dhoni's experience
 aisa nahin he ki 36 saal ke baad cricketron ne apane pradarshan main sudhaar nahin kiya
 Sachin Tendulkar played some of the best innings in both Tests and odis between 2009-11
 dhoni ke paas kshamta or pratibha he
 But young talent like Rishabh Pant is putting pressure on him who is waiting for a chance
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) sawaal yah he ki kya 2019 vishwa cap main 38 saal kii umr main vah bharat ke liye match jeet sakate hai
 The answer lies with Dhoni only
 haal ke samay main dhoni ke ballebaaji main sangharsh karne se lagata he ki finishr kii unki kshamta main giravat ai he
 But if asked whether he is still the best wicketkeeper and one of the most fit players in the team, the answer will definitely be yes
 simit overon ke cricket main bharat ke mahaan khilaadiyon main shaamil dhoni ko lekar yah ajeeb si sthiti he
 He can win a few matches, he is brilliant with his agility behind the wicket but will it be enough to convince captain Kohli to give him 45 matches to play before the World Cup in Britain
 dhoni ke paksh main jo cheez jaati he vah bharat kaa majboot ballebaaji kram he
 Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan are present in the top order while Lokesh Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane are there to support him and Dhoni will not be required for most of the day
 antim overon main tabadatod ballebaaji ke liye hardik pandya bhi team main shaamil hai
 The comments samasya yah he ki paanchvaan or chatha kram kaaphi mahatvapurn jisamen wicket par tikne kaa adhik samay nahin miltaa
 Dhoni has not been among the players who hit big sixes as soon as he came on the field, but now the problem is that he is not scoring even one or two runs regularly in the beginning which is putting pressure
 kohli haalanki dhoni ke anubhav par nirbhar rah sakate hai
 It is not that the cricketers did not improve their performance after 36 years
 sachin tendulkar ne 2009-11 ke bich test or vanade donon main kuch behtareen paariyaan kheli
 Dhoni has potential and talent
 lekin rishabh pant jaisi yuva pratibha un par dabaav bana rahi he jise mauka milane kaa intjaar he

 pradesh kii maujuuda sthiti par piem modi ne tippanee karte hue piem modi ne kaha tha, 'gaanv main kabristaan banataa he to shamshaan bhi bananaa chahie, ramajaan main bijli aati he to deepawali par bhi aani chahie, pradesh kii janata ke bich kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 "therefore, to highlight the recent situation in the state by the PM, to stop the exercise of taking advantage in the elections, CM Yadav said that Amitabh Bachchan is a great hero of the century
 unhen gujarat ke gadhon kaa prachaar nahin karnaa chahie
 With this statement, CM Yadav tried to term PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah as an outsider during the election season of the state
 pashuon par raajnneetika yahi ek maamla nahin he
 Apart from Modi and Akhilesh, BJP President Amit Shah has also jumped into the politics of the state with his animal of choice
 pradesh main chuwan prachaar ke dauraan kai baar amit shah daawa kar chuke hai ki rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banate hi raaton-raat puure pradesh main maujuud boojadkhaanon ko band kar diya jayega
 Shah has reiterated his statement once again in Allahabad, saying that terror like Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmed will be completely eradicated from the state
 shah ne kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ke kaarykaal main pradesh main pashuon ke khun kii nadiyaan bah rahi hai lekin chunaav ke nattejey aate hi pradesh main pashuon kaa khun bahaane kaa kaam puri tarah se sil band kar diya jayega
 a strange thing in the case of tremendous shelling on the 198 km long border in Jammu and Kashmir was that all instructions were given from the Prime Minister's Office
 aam taur par aisi sthiti main grih, raksha or videsh mantralay ke adhikari apane rajnatik netritv ko sahi faisle lene main salaah or sahaayta dete hai
 Not only this, there was no meeting of the Cabinet Security Committee or Secretaries to assess the situation, nor was there any assessment of the consequences of retaliatory attacks on both sides

 udhar pakistani fouj 'final blo' oparation main uttari wajiristaan main apane hi logon se hichakate hue lard rahi he or baari nuksaan uthaa rahi he
 In such a situation, a fire on the Indian front gives an excuse for the fresh deployment of the army on the Kashmir border

 Dangerous game: International diplomats of India are being asked to hold the Pakistan Army responsible for such conflict on the border

 In this case, international pressure may increase and now it is becoming a diplomatic challenge

 'the problem for India is that the further it goes on the aggressive approach, the more it can have the opposite effect in Pakistan

 Another effect of this was that before Diwali, the risk of danger increased

 Nitish Kumar demanded from the Central Government that Bihar should get its right as the right to development is its right
 apane bhaashan ke shuruyaat main nitish kumaar ne kaha ki yah pehla mauka jab dilli main bihariyon ne apni takat dikhaai he
 Bihar has asked for its right for the first time and we should get it
 nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir rajya ko vishesh darja dene kii maang uthaate hue ravivaar ko kaha ki yadi iske liye mandandon main parivartan karnaa pade to yah bhi kiya janaa chahie
 He accused the central government of 'neglecting' the state
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli ke ramlila maidan main 'adhikaar raily' ko sambodhit karte hue nitish ne kaha, 'yadi aap prati vyakti aay dekhen to hamaari aay desh ke rashtriya prati vyakti aay ke ek-tihaai se thodi hi adhik he

 Bihar has been neglected, the center considers Bihar as backward, but it does not do anything; Bihar has got special state status, we will also develop
 People of Bihar are not begging
 We are fighting for the right of every backward state
 The Prime Minister also praised the development of Bihar
 That in the last seven years, confidence has come
 There is still more fight ahead
 In 2014, there should be a government that develops backward states and we take our rights Whether it will get special state status or after 2014, Geddu passed a resolution demanding special status for Bihar in Ramlila Maidan, in 2014, it is not right-left to see directly

 The cloud of smoke produced by burning straw in Punjab makes it difficult for people to breathe in the National Capital Region (NCR) and large parts of North India every year
 ab punjab ne ek mahatvakankshi kaarykram kaa sahaara liya he, taaki har saal dhan kii fasal se bachane vaali kareeb 2 karod ton paraali ko surakshit tareeke se khapaaya ja sake
 The state government has tied up with Chennai-based solid waste management firm Nivea Engineers Private Limited using 'zero Residue Technology' to produce problematic straw or straw with high-energy carbon-rich fuel (CEF), bricks and paver blocks Will change to yadi company or punjab ke nivesh protsaahan beuro ke bich hue emoyu ke mutabik kaam hua, to rajya ke kisaanon ko khet taiyaar karne ke liye dhan kii paraali ko jalaane kii jarurat nahin hogi

 "we will use a new carbonization-devolating process, for which patents have been applied in 148 countries including India, the European Union and North America," he explains
 '' sivakumar ne kaha ki nive pehle se hi safaltaapurvak is takanic kaa istemaal chennai main nagar nigam ke thos kachare (emesdblyoo) ko siief eendhan main badalane main kar rahi he
 Rakesh Kumar Verma, head of the Punjab Investment Bureau, says Nivea has launched Rs 10,000 crore to launch its unique agri-residue management system

 This system will start working 10 months from now

 Nivea will set up a farmer hotline running around the clock for 24 hours and will purchase parali according to the crop cycle of Malwa, Doaba and Majha areas
 is upkram se kareeb 30,000 logon ko rojgaar milegaa, kyonki nive ke kaamkaaj main masini nikasi, kataai, sukhaane or paraali kaa ga-r bana use cluster binduon tak pahunchane ke liye shramik chahie honge

 aise prayek centre kaa nirmaan saat acre jameen main kiya jayega or iske liye jameen sthaneey panchayat yaa logon se lij par lee jaaegi
 However, this will be a big challenge as Nivea will get barely a month to remove all 20 million tonnes of straw from the fields so that it can be sown for the Rabi crop in time
 iske liye company prati acre maamuli 'yujar charge' legi
 According to state administration sources, this charge is between Rs 100 and 500

 The question arises that such a huge amount for investment (rs 10,000 crore)
 ) kahaan se aegi? is par sivakumar kehete hai, ''singapore or honkong ke nijee niveshkon ke ek consorcium kii taraf se paisa aayega, jo teesri duniya kii harith yojanaon main nivesh karne ke icchhuk hai
 "nivea has proposed to give 50 per cent stake to such investors and a representative of the company believes that" money is not a big problem

 he or vah punjab main vishalkay 10,000 karod ke upkram par kaam karne kii baat kar rahi he
 The State Investment Bureau is saying that it is fully vigilant in this matter, but Verma says that it has no financial implications for the state government, as it is only giving the company the facility to start operations in Punjab

 Amid growing controversy over land acquisition, the government introduced a new Land Acquisition Bill, which laid out a transparent legal framework aimed at providing adequate compensation to landowners and rehabilitating the displaced
 bahupratikshit ‘rashtriya bhoomi adhigrahan evam punarvaas va punarsthapana vidheyak, 2011’ ke masaude main kaha gaya he, ‘shahari ilaakon ke maamle main muaavja raashi bazaar mulya ke dogune se kam nahin hogi, jabaki gramin ilaakon main yah bazaar mulya ke chah guna se kam nahin hogi
 The draft bill proposes that if the government acquires land for the use of private companies for public purpose or PPP projects other than national highways, it will be mandatory to get the consent of 80 percent of the families affected by the project
 masaude main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jis saarvajanik kaary kaa ullekh hoga usamen baad main badlaav nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 The draft suggested that under no circumstances multi-cropped, irrigated land would be acquired
 is tarah kii adhikansh bhoomi punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal or bihar ke ganga ke maidan main sthit hai
 Also, the government will not acquire land for private purpose on behalf of private companies
 gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha ki bharat main bhoomi kaa bazaar kaaphi ‘trutipurna’ he
 It is written in the Preamble of the draft that there is a huge imbalance in the rights and information of the people who want to acquire the land and whose land is being acquired
 ‘yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ko paardarshee evam lacheele niyam lagu karne main bhoomika adaa kerani pad rahi he jisase ise lagu kiya janaa sunishchit ho sake
 The draft bill proposes to authorize the government to implement 'emergency rules' for acquisition of land in matters of defense and security of the country
 sarkaar apatkaal yaa prakritik aapadaaon kii sthiti main punarsthapana evam punarvaas kii jaruraton ko puraa karne evam kisi ‘durlabh maamalon’ main bhoomi kaa adhigrahan kar sakegi
 The features of the draft bill include a comprehensive rehabilitation package for landowners and those who lose their means of livelihood
 inamen ve log bhi shaamil hai jo roji roti ke liye adhigrahit kii ja rahi bhoomi par nirbhar hai
 The draft includes a pension facility of Rs 3,000 per family per month for 12 months and Rs 2,000 per family for 20 years
 saath hi isamen parivaar ke ek sadsy ko rojgaar uplabdh karana or agar rojgaar evam anya protsaahanon kii peshkash nahin kii jaati to do lakh rupee uplabdh karaane kii anivaaryta he
 The draft for landowners also provides that if the landowner's land is acquired for an irrigation project, one acre of land in the project area should be made available to each family
 shaharikaran ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke maamle main viksit bhoomi kaa 20 pratishat arakshit kiya jayega or adhigrahit bhoomi ke anupaat main maalikon ko uski peshkash kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, if tribal land is acquired, one acre land should be given to each scheduled tribe family in each project
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jin pariwaron kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya ja rahaa he use 50,000 rupee bataur ekamusth vittiya sahaayta di jaani chahie

 In fact, Katare had questioned the selection of Ritu Chauhan that he got a notice from the Nazul department of Bhopal
 notice main kataare ke arera colony main chal rahe health centre par aapatti jataai gai he
 According to Katare, the notice has been sent in retaliation

 Bhikhu Parekh It is often forgotten how huge the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi were
 unki 150veen jayanti ke maukey par unhen yaad karnaa acha hoga
 He was the first Indian to bring India to the global map and also the only Indian to be known worldwide
 ve pehle bhartiya the jinhone bharat se pehle bharat ke baahar apni rajnatik chhap chodi
 He has been the greatest leader in the history of India, mobilizing people behind him, who brought millions of men and especially women into public life
 ek-chauthai sadi tak bhartiya raajnneeti main unka itnaa bolbalaa rahaa ki jisane bhi unki naaraazgi mol lee, usne rajnatik aatmahatya kii
 He was the only Indian, but truly, leader of the world who touched life on many different levels and each of them had something to say about it, whether it was health, cleanliness, childbearing
 -ability, morality, sexuality, religion, economy or top-class politics
 aazaadee ke vakt, jiske liye ve ji-jaan se lade the, chautarafa faili hinsa se gandhi itane dukhi the ki unhone rashtriya dhvaj fahraane se or sandesh tak dene se inkaar kar diya
 He refused to take any political position for himself and spent the last two years of his life healing the wounds of communal violence
 yahaan tak ki jab unke sharir main sahane kii takat nahin bachi, tab bhi unhone upwas kiye, noakhli ke gaanvon kii patharilii sadakon par akele chale or peediton se guzarish kii ki ve dayalutaa or kshamaa dikhaaen
 Although his life was in danger, he flatly refused to take security and not only challenged his critics to the worst, but even to the feast, one of which he did
 haalanki, gandhi kii apni simaaen thim, par anek kshetron main ve behad prerak or shikshaprad the or yahi unhen 20veen sadi ke mahanatam logon main se ek banaata he
 Gandhi suffered repression and injustice in most of his adult life
 dakshin africa main first class main safar kii jurrat karne kii vajah se ek sard raat unhen train se nikaalkar baahar phenk diya gaya, gaali-galouj karte hue conductor ne unhen coach se neeche patake diya or vah to ganimat thi ki saathi musafiron ne unhen bachaa liya
 To pretend to pass in front of President Krueger's house in Pretoria, the concierge kicked him and dropped him into the groove
 transwaal main unhen 1900 ke registration kanoon kaa virodh karne kii vajah se giraftaar kar liya gaya or aam mujarimon ke saath jail kii kothri main rakhaa gaya, jo unki taraf yon ishaare or unki maujuudagi main bhaddi harakatein karte the
 In Durban, a racist white mob hurled stones at them and were beaten to such an extent that they had to take shelter in a nearby police station to save their lives, and later could go out in disguise as policemen
 gandhi ne apane in or aise hi duusare anubhavon par gaharaai se soch-vichaar kiya or poocha ki yah sara daman tathaa atyaachaar kyon hua or usamen peedit kii kya bhoomika thi
 They came to the conclusion that the victims of Daman were not innocent at all
 darasal, apane daman main unki mileebhagat thi
 The British ruled India with the help of Indians
 jaliyanvaala baag narsanhaar main bhartiya sainikon ne hi apane saathi bharatiyon par goliyaan chalaayin
 Gandhi went even further and argued that all this strength was finally achieved only with the help of the victim, without which they would have been hollow
 chunki saadhaaran aadamiyon or auraton ke bheetar is kism kii takat maujuud thi, isliye jarurat is baat kii thi ki ve apni aazaadee kii khatir yah takat dikhaaen or apane maalikon ko sahyog dene se inkaar karen
 Most of them were unable to do so due to fear or nervousness
 dakshin africa main bharatiyon ko jhidakate hue gandhi ne kaha ki jo khud keedon-makodon kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, unhen kuchle jane par dusron ko dosha nahin dena chahie
 In another context, he also asked the Indians to learn to 'revolt against themselves'
 gandhi ke liye saahas aatm-sammaan se bandhaa tha or mahaan maanviya gun tha
 His concern was how to awaken the self-esteem of the victims of injustice
 jaisaa ki nehru ne kaha tha, unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha ki unhone bharat ko jakade hue dar kii chadar hataa di or uske bhaybheet or sankochi logon ko takat di
 Another area in which Gandhi spoke deep is related to his practice of non-violence
 unke tain ise galat samajha gaya tha ki keval nuksaan na pahunchaana hi ahimsa he
 If an animal is dying of an incurable disease and has only a few hours of life left, then it is an act of love to end its life by injecting life-threatening injections
 isamen hinsa he, par yah hinsak krity nahin he
 As Gandhi once said, the correct English translation of non-violence is not 'non-violence' but 'compassion' or 'love'
 kai duusare pahaluon main bhi gandhi ne ahimsa kii avadharana ko vistaar or gaharaai di
 Loss in the Indian tradition is defined in a way that includes not only physical harm but also psychological, moral and other forms of suffering or affliction
 gandhi ne is vyapak paribhaasha ko na keval sweekaar kiya balki iskaa vistaar bhi kiya
 In his opinion, one can harm or kill someone by firing bullets or depriving him of basic necessities of life for a long time
 chaahe koi 'ek jatke main' maare yaa 'thodaa-thodaa karke', nateeja vahi hota he or isliye usamen shaamil vyakti hinsa kaa doshi he
 Disrespecting, degrading or humiliating others, hurting self-esteem, uttering harsh words, imposing tough judgments, anger and mental cruelty are also forms of violence
 gandhi kaa ahimsa kaa vichaar satyagrah ke aacharan par aadhaarit tha, jisamen duusare ko khud apni pidaa ke jariye badla jaataa he
 He called it 'tearing of the soul'
 satyagrahi jise satya yaa nyaaysangat maang samajhataa he, uske aadhaar par apana rukh tay karata he, par saath hi apane sangharsh kii roshni main apane vichaaron ko badalane kii sambhaavna ko bhi khulaa rakhata he
 He aroused the superior tendencies of his adversary, groped his conscience, opened his heart and mind and sought his cooperation in the search and attainment of a just solution
 haalanki, gandhi bahut dharmik vyakti the, ve kisi kattarpanthi yaa dharmaandh vyakti se sabase zyada alag bhi the
 This was because he firmly believed that no religion is perfect and he must confine himself to the test of human logic and experience
 yah kabhi purna isliye nahin ho saktaa kyonki isaki abhivyakti ek khaas bhashaa main, itihaas ke khaas padaav par hui or uski tarah-tarah kii vyakhyaayein kii ja sakati hai
 Since this is so, every religion deserves respect
 saath hi, vah dusron se bhi bahut kuch sikh saktaa he or isliye duusare dharmon ke saath use vinamrata se pesh aana chahie
 Gandhi himself, while presenting a great example of this, borrowed openly from other religions, especially from Christianity, and blended it beautifully into Hinduism
 gandhi kaa maardarshak siddhant yah tha ki udaatt vichaaron ko sabhi dishaao se apane paas aane do
 He wanted to live in a house with walls for his protection, but with his windows open so that fresh thoughts would come
 gahare arth main gandhi bahusaanskrithikta yaa samskritiyon ke saath rachanaatmak samvaad ke pehle siddhantkaar or sadhak the
 His way of understanding the nature of religion is safe from fundamentalism and is very relevant to our difficult world
 gandhi kaa rajnatik netritv kaa vichaar bhi itnaa hi lubhaavna or prerak he
 As a leader of the national movement, he was very cautious about what to expect from the leader and the limits of his strength
 jab unhen laga ki unka asahyog andolan galat disha main chalaa gaya or hinsak ho uthaa he, tab unhone ise himalay jaisi baari bhul bataaya or waapas le liya
 It is difficult to find any other leader in history who has openly admitted his mistake and tried to improve
 sampradayik hinsa ko lekar bhi gandhi aisa hi sochate the, khaskar 1946 or 1948 ke bich
 He felt that he might not have paid enough attention to it
 chote se chote galat faisle ke liye khud ko takalif dene vaale shakchas hone ke naate gandhi ne isaki nijee jimmedaari lee or hinsa ke khilaaf apni ladaai main apni jaan tak jhonk di
 As a leader, he felt that it was his duty not to step too far ahead of his colleagues, let alone go against his thoughtful decision
 yah bhi ek vajah thi ki ve desh ke bantwaare ke khilaaf 'aamaran anshan' ke apane aadhe-adhure vaade par aage nahin bade, khaskar tab jab unke takreeban tamaam varisht saathi bantwaare ko sweekaar kar chuke the
 Gandhi had his limitations
 jaisaa ki nehru ne lord mountbayton se kaha tha, gandhi itane manushya the ki sant nahin ho sakate the
 His views on celibacy tested faith and his idea of sexuality as an animalistic impulse ignores its rich moral and emotional potential
 ahimsa kii param shakti main unka vishwaas bholaa-bhaalaa tha
 As Martin Buber and others have pointed out, the Nazis would have dealt with Gandhi even before he took his first step towards Satyagraha
 unhen buraai kii fitrat or gaharaai ke bare main simit samaj thi or uski maujuudagi se ve hakkaa-bakka mahasoos karte the
 Despite these and similar personal and philosophical limitations, Gandhi's ideas have the potential to show us the way
 unke jivan main, jise unhone apana sandesh kaha tha, durlabh gaharaai or bhavyata thi
 On his 150th birth anniversary, we should study his thoughts with gratitude and take inspiration from whatever deep things we find relevant and trustworthy
