 lekin bhaajapa sarkaar ne kisaanon kii samasya sulajhane kii bajaay kisaan aatmahatya kii report se chhedchhad karnaa or use dabaakar rakhana zyaada sahi samajha
 In another tweet, while posting a video of an onion farmer, Priyanka wrote, "what is the plight of the BJP government by the BJP government?" To stop the rising prices of onion, onion is being imported from outside, but our farmers do not get the right price for hard-grown onions
 '' unhone twit kiya, ‘‘kisaanon ko sahi daam do, suvidha do, sammaan do
 Strengthen the farmer, not strengthen it
 '' priyanka gandhi ne sawaal poochhate hue likhaa, ‘‘kisaan ko ek kilo pyaaj ke aath rupaye mil rahe hai or bazaar main pyaaj 100 rupee kilo he

 All of them have died due to their promises
 " (sonchidiya main manoj vaajapeyi)aaj ke daur kii kai filmon ke samvaad main hamen kshetreey bhashaaon kii khushboo milti he
 Hindi cinema is now engraving colors on the silver screen with the village to create characters in place of spoken Hindi
 in behad sthaneey bhashaaon ko samajhane main darshakon ko koi dikkat pesh nahin aa rahi
 In such dialects, through dialogues, people are also understanding the meaning of words like 'boy' of Gully Boy, and Bundelkhandi and Odia used in bitter air
 pehle aise samvaad amuman kala filmon main hi istemaal kiye jate the par ab ye mukhyadhara cinema ke nirmaataaon ko bhi bha rahe hai
 After Satya, Gully Boy's Mumbai dialogues have moved among cinematographers
 filmein ho yaa websiries kahani ke canvas main jo jagah he, uske saath uski bhashaa bhi chali aa rahi he
 If all the characters in the web series Mirzapur speak Hindi with Avadhi's touch, then the characters of many films including Anarkali of Aara, Sonchidiya, Masan and Gully Boy interact in languages and dialects like Bhojpuri, Bundelkhandi, Awadhi, Haryanvi
 sthaniyata ke is put ne box offis par in filmon kii madad hi kii
 "it is a golden age for regional dialect," says Avinash Das, writer-director of Anarkali of Ara
 "hindi filmon main desi boli main samvaad likhane vaale lekhak boli ko lekar kaaphi research karte hai
 Some people describe this as the new trend of dialogue writing
 lekin masaan ke samvaad lekhak varun grover ise trend maanane se inkaar karte hai
 He says, "cinema is not soap that they make fragrant
 aapako apni kahani kehani hoti he
 This story is in Bangla as in Bhojpuri or in Mumbai language as Gully Boy has come
 har kahani kii bhashaa hoti he
 The story whose language will be told will reach the people
 " ve sawaal karte hue kehete hai, ''gali boy khadi boli main banegi kya? isi tarah ham masaan dakshin bhartiya bhashaa main banaaenge to thode na vah logon ko samaj main aegi
 From where will Ganga come to South India? ”movies like Udta Punjab and Sonchidiya have also been in the news due to their dialogue
 inke samvaad iiem se padhai karne vaale sudeep sharma ne likhe hai
 Sharma says, "if you have to present the story in a particular province and we want the fragrance of the soil there, then language will have to be given there too
 " sharma ke mutabik, pehle nirmaataa apni film main sthaneey bhashaa ke istemaal se ghabaraate the
 The makers were also convinced by the likes of Bambaiya in Satya, Bundelkhandi in Bandit Queen and the typical Khadi dialect in Omkara
 ve kehete hai, ''har bhashaa kaa ek sound hota he
 If your character is Bundelkhandi and talks in Bundelkhandi, then not only does his way of speaking change but his way of thinking also changes
 unki manodasha main pahunchnaa padataa he samvaad likhte vakt
 "sharma explains that he gets a lot of help from the local people in terms of language
 likhane ke baad bhi ve draft ko kisi sthaneey ko padhwaate hai taaki feedback mil sake
 He says, "actors take home dialogue like a challenge nowadays
 unako bhi majaa aata he
 Acting somewhere also means that you can reach another world
 donon hi filmon main bhashaa ko samajhane main actors ne kaaphi mehnat kii thi
 "after Sonchidiya, Sharma has written Bundelkhandi dialogues in another upcoming film
 amejan kii ek thriller web siries main bundelkhandi ke saath punjabi or hariyaanvi ke samvaad die hai
 Avinash's approach to journalism from journalism is also quite grounded
 ve kehete hai, ''aaj jise desi bhashaa bolte hai, ye koi nai bhashaa nahin he
 Cinema is picking up a little of it for the scattered language in the middle of our society
 aaj janata hi dialog riter he
 "they believe that mainstream cinema is impacting such medium-term films
 ve kehete hai, ''bhashaa ke maamle main bandit queen to yalgaar he ek tarah se
 You will tell the story of Bundelkhand or Ara, Chhapra, and keep the language of Delhi and Mumbai, it is not possible
 reel ko real karne ke liye bhashaa par kaam karnaa bahut jaruri he
 "avinash believes that if you will tell the story by keeping the entire location well, then there is no sense of language in the industry
 par kai dfa yah andeh bhi hota he ki kuch behad sthaneey shabd hai jinke na samajhe jane kaa khatra bhi hota he
 Says Avinash, "there are such challenges in writing dialogue in the native language
 dabaav bhi hota he ki ye shabd yaa muhaavara nahin samajhenge, to thodaa bahut badalanaa padataa he
 We saved the language despite a 20 percent agreement on language
 " kuchhek chote samjhauton ke baad bhi samvaad main desipan kaa sparsh aa jaataa he to ise kamyaabi hi mana janaa chahie
 He shares his experience, saying that one of the words in Swara Bhaskar's dialogue had to be changed
 iske baad tivi ke liye ek shabd ko hataanaa padaa tha jisase puri film kaa maayna hi badal gaya tha
 They acknowledge that the market for regional languages has also grown due to web platforms like Netflix and Amazon
 theatre becoground se aane vaale vijay maury ko chillar party ke original screenple ke liye neshnal award mil chukaa he
 He has been a part of Sathya film
 desi sanvaadon ko lekar maury utsahit hai
 He says, "personally, i consider the native dialect dialogue a very good step
 ve maanate hai ki is samay samvaad par jo kaam ho rahaa he, vah krantikari kadam he
 There is a fun look in the dialog
 " ve aage bataate hai ki gali boy main mumbai kii jo bhashaa maine istemaal kii he wo kitabon main nahin milegi aapako
 There are many writer brothers who are from Kanpur, Muzaffarpur, Lucknow, they bring their things to the cinema and it has originality, it is a revolution
 asal main, gali boy kii nirdeshak joya akhtar ne unase saaf kaha tha ki samvaad main kisi tarah kii gaali nahin honi chahie
 And Maurya has not used a single rebuke in the entire film
 maury muskaraate hue bataate hai, ''kuch shabd hai to wo seekhney ke liye hai
 For example, if it is hard, it means hard, hard
 lekin mumbaiya boli main bahut khub, kya baat he
 Today's youth have their own script, a local language
 " jaahir he, jaise kapadon kaa fishan badalata he vaise hi shabdon kaa bhi fishan bhi badal rahaa he
 In Hindi films, Chalik Li Le Thin Gali, Chal Kat Le Le, it has become old and almost worn out
 shaayad isiilie maury gali boy main kamati ho chal jaise nae muhaavarey lekar aae hai
 Said Maurya, "today's star is not avoiding such language
 aalia mumbai kii hai baavjood iske unhen bolne kaa lahaza samajhaayaa gaya
 Ranveer Singh did not face any problem
 gali boy ke liye hamane ek sef rasta nikaala or wo brokene hindi he
 "sanjay Mishra speaks in Bundelkhandi in bitter air" and Ranbir Shourie speaks his words in Odia and language does not come in the way of helping Mishra's helpless farmer to reach the audience and neither does his communication with the language of Shourie having a Yamdoot like image in the film
 There is danger
 desi boli or bani in dinon cinema ke sir chadhakar bol rahi he
 Film desi thing is also Bhot hard, Bhotai hard

 The matter is four thousand years old
 china kaa ek badshaah hua karata tha, jiskaa naam shin nong tha
 Once he went hunting and was tired and resting under the tree

 Then a few leaves of a nearby tree fell in it
 pani ublaa badshaah ne piyaa or uski sari thakaan dur ho gai or vah apane saath jate hue us ped kii kuch pattiyaan le gaya
 In this way, such a drink stepped into our life, which gave us some moments to relax and talk, besides giving us a boost in the direction of being healthy

 "green, oolong and black tea
" jiro oxidised vaali pattee green tii hoti he, half oxidised pattee oologan tii hoti he jabaki phul oxidised ko blike tii kehete hai
 "black tea is often taken with milk and sugar in India, while green tea is not used at all
" visheshgy maanate hai ki chaay main zyada doodh daalane se bachanaa chahie kyonki isse chaay ke adhiktar aushadhiy tatv mar jate hai
 Therefore, one or two cups a day should also be taken without sugar and milk
 assam kii tii-research association ke vaigyanik dow
 Devjit Borthakur says, "the antioxidants beneficial for the body are thiaflavin and thirabigins forming complex structures with milk proteins present in tea
" yahi vajah he ki doodh kii chaay pine waalon ko na to inkaa phayda miltaa he or na hi milk protein kaa phayda miltaa he
 Therefore, taking tea without milk is good for health
 ’’anti oxident thiaflavin or thiyarabigins motaape ke saath-saath cholestrol kam karne main bhi sahaayak hote hai
 As far as the question of black and green tea is concerned, it is a matter of taste which tea to drink

 According to a research conducted at the Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Hein University, Germany, one should drink at least four cups of tea a day to avoid diabetes
 ab tak chaay par hue zyaadaatar shodh green-tii par kendrit the
 But researchers have found that black-tea is also no less beneficial
 british medical jarnal main prakashit ek shodh bataata he ki blike-tii ke zyada seven kaa sambandh motopa kam hone se he
 The reason behind this is that researchers think that during the process of transforming green-tea into black-tea, it is known as fermentation that 'flavanoids' are beneficial for health

 ajay maakan ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki arvind kejariwal pehle chidambaram ko bhrasht netaa kaha karte the or ab unki madad se supreme court main cese lard rahe hai
 Kejriwal tell whether Chidambaram is not corrupt now? After all, why Kejriwal accuses everyone and then retracts? Earlier Sandeep Dixit also wrote a post on Facebook
 is post main unhone likhaa tha ki ek samay main jab upie kii sarkaar thi or grih mantri pi
 If Chidambaram was there then there was a figure of thirty-six between Kejriwal and Chidambaram

 Further, Ashutosh said that the Aam Aadmi Party had strongly opposed the fall of the Congress government in Uttarakhand and Arunachal, but the Congress is leaving the old things and strengthening the BJP in Delhi

 Quote New style! Explaining the changing concept over time in the language of investment, Ajay Kedia, Managing Director of Kedia Commodity, says, "the sense of security with gold was associated with it even before
 pehle log sone ko saamaajik suraksha ke taur par dekhte the, nakadi kaa vikalp maanate the
 Today, when the economies of the world are in crisis, the markets are collapsing, by considering gold as a safe investment option, big investors or managers of mutual funds also increase the share of gold in their portfolio
 '' jaise-jaise gaanvon tak banking suvidhaayen, lenden ke aadhunik taur-tareeke or nivesh ke vikalp pahunch rahe hai, sone par nirbharta kam ho rahi he
 Significantly, 60 percent of gold in India is purchased in rural areas only
 kedia yah bhi kehete hai, "share bazaar, property kii tarah hi sone ko nivesh ke vikalp ke rup main samajhnaa hoga
 Investing in gold through mediums like ETF, Bond, Digital Gold would be better than buying jewelry
 ''india bullian and jewalers association ke adhyaksh yogesh singhl kehete hai, "badhati mahangaai, gramin ilaakon main sankat or badalte soch kii vajah se sone kii gharelu maang main kami ai he
 Apart from this, jewelery sector has suffered a lot due to expensive imports, ban of PAN card and demonetisation on buying jewelery of more than 2 lakhs
 '' desh ke bade trading centre dilli ke kuuchaa mahajanee kaa zikr karte hue singhl yah bhi bataate hai, "tyoharon se pehle bazaar main bahut bheed rahati thi lekin ab dhandha manda he
 The government needs major changes in tax policies to boost the jewelery sector

 This sector provides employment to more than 46 lakh people in the country

 In such a situation, the global market and the movement of the rupee play an important role in deciding the prices of gold
 kaise? janvari se ab tak dollar ke mukaable rupaya kareeb 14 fisadi kamjor he
 In such a situation, if the real price of gold has not increased even than January, then Rs 100

 That is, fetching gold from Dubai or America becomes 27 percent costlier
 vaishvik bazaar main kaarobaari sone kaa bhav 1,230 dollar prati ounce ke str par kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 What should investors do? Personal finance expert Balwant Jain says, "investors of gold should buy as much as is necessary for their consumption
 bhavishya main upyog karne ke liye agar sona ikattha karnaa he to gold bond sabase acha tarika he
 "for example, if you want to collect gold for the daughter or son's wedding, then invest in gold bond
 yahaan niveshkon ko sone kii badi hui keemton ke alaava byaaj kaa bhi phayda milegaa

 uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh main ram mandir ko lekar asarkaari muhim dikhti rahi he
 The saint has many times pleaded with the government to seriously consider the issue
 sadhu santon kaa ek gut congress ke samarthan main utraa or modi sarkaar ko mandir nirmaan main dhilaai ke liye doshi tehraaya
 Pramod Krishnam was often seen standing in the front row in this campaign
 congress bhi pichley 5 saal main ram mandir ke liye kuch na kar paane ko lekar bijepi ko nishaanaa banaati rahi he
 Perhaps that's why the Congress has placed bets on Pramod Krishnam, so that he can raise his voice more firmly and surround the BJP
 bataa den ki pichley chunaav main pramod krishnam sanbhal se chunaav lard chuke hai
 Acharya Pramod Krishnam is a resident of Aichoda Kamboh village in Sambhal district
 yah gaanv asmoli kshetra main padataa he
 More than politics, there is talk of his Kalki Peeth which he has made in his village
 krishnam kalki peethadhishwar ke rup main jane jate hai
 However, his keen interest in politics is also well known, which can be easily seen in TV debates
 desh main aise kam hi sadhu-sant hai jo kisi party line se judakar apni raajnneetik mahatvakanksha jataate hai
 One of these names Pramod Krishnam is also taken prominently
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sanbhal se congress ke tikat par chunaav lade lekin buree tarah haar gaye
 He got only 16034 votes and slipped to fifth position
 ab kagress ne unhen dobaaraa mauka diya he or lakhanu jaisi hai profile seat se utaara he
 Pramod Krishnam has a great interest in politics as a saint
 tivi channelon par congress kaa raajnneetik stand rakhane ke alaava chunavi reliyon main bhi ve logon kaa dhyaan khinchate rahe hai
 In the recent Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly elections, he took charge as the star campaigner of the Congress
 sanyog se congress kii yahaan sarkaar bhi bani
 Seeing the eloquence of Pramod Krishnam, the Congress has again placed him prominently in the list of star campaigners

 badalon main kahin zyada itmeenaan se vakt jo guzaara ja saktaa he
 *** offis main baithe hai, kaam kar rahe hai or achaanak ek massej aata he
 It is written in the message that Google Octro transaction was successful and 250 rupees was cut
 aise ek nahin balki lagaataar har second maisejon kii jhadi lag gai
 Money was deducted
 15 minute ke antaraal main 10 se zyada massej aae or aakhirkaar acount se 12 hajaar rupee cat gaye
 When he called Customer Care, he said, "we can only block the card and cannot tell where this transaction is happening
" iske liye aapako bank janaa hoga’customras care ne kuch bhi bataane se inkaar kiya he or kaha wo iske liye othriced nahin he
 This is not the first and last time a fraud case has surfaced on sbi's card
 pehle aise kai maamle dekhne ko mili hai jahaan customer ko lakhon kaa chuunaa laga diya gaya he
 a few months ago a similar fraud occurred with a government official
 unhen bhi google austro tranjaction ke massej lagaataar or minute bhar main acount se 78 hajaar rupee cat gaye
 The same happened to him as it happened today
 ek ke baad ek lagaataar massej aate rahe or paise katate chale gaye
 In June, the officer told TOI that neither the police nor the bank gave any concrete information about the fraud
 ye paise kyon kate, kahaan gaye or kya chook ho gai iske bare main na to police ne bataaya he or na hi bank adhikariyon ne
 The big question arises that who is doing this fraud and how? Are such frauds being done from other countries? Why does the State of India not issue any statement about this fraud? Why does Google Austro fraud only happen with the State Bank of India card
 kya he google octrohamane jab is baat kii padtaal kii ki aakhir google octro kya he
 Actually Octro Inc
 is a company that makes games
 google play store par iske game kaaphi popular hai
 The company claims that its games are played over 10 lakhs every day
 google play store par octro ink ke ye games maujuud hantin pattee live, tambola house, kairam live, yuddh bhumi, danki quid, card royaal, sleep, sneke and leader, pokar live or ludo live
 Significantly, Octro is the company of Noida and manufactures games
 hamane is company se baatcheet karne kii koshish kii he
 Now, according to Google, what is the meaning of such a transaction, this information has been found about the unauthorized charge on the Google support page
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa ho to isse aap madad le sakate hai
 According to Google, if the name of Google * App Developer is written in the message of deducting money, then this transaction has taken place on Google Play itself
 is maamle main thik aise hi massej aae hai
 Customer got a message from Google * Octro
 yani octro develpar he jiske bare main hamane pehle bataaya he or yah google play par tranjaction hua he
 That is, it is clear that this transaction is done through the Google Play Store and it is being done for Octro
 lekin yah frod he, kyonki customer ne na to card kii jaankaree kisi ko di he or na hi kabhi game khelaa he
 According to Google, first the customer should make sure that the children of the house do it by mistake, so check it
 agar aap shyor hai ki aap is tranjaction main bhagidaar nahin hai, to google saport team main complaint kar sakate hai
 But it has to be compiled within 15 days of such transaction
 iske alaava police main or bank main bhi shikaayat kii ja sakati he
 This state has never been unaware of scams
 aisa lagata he ki bihar ek ke baad ek ghotaale jhelane kaa aadi ho gaya he, or agar dekha jaae to hameshaa hi ghotaale ke liye jimmedaar badi machhliyaan kaaphi had tak pakad main aa hi nahin paati hai
 Year after year, Bihar remains in the headlines due to financial irregularities and cases of irregularities
 lekin yah maamla-agar yah ghotaalaa kahalaane kii sharton par khara utarataa he- apane vishaal aakaar or paimaane ke kaaran sabake upar baari pad saktaa he
 Worse is that this irregularity has taken place at the time when Bihar's reins are in the hands of Nitish Kumar, who is recognized as a flamboyant politician with experience and an administrative understanding of dealing with such irregularities

 11,412 crore Rs
 vah rakam he jiskaa vibhinn sarkari adhikariyon ko bhugtan kiya gaya lekin in bhugtanon ko lekar anivaary vistrut aakasmik (disi) bill jamaa nahin karaae gaye
 Such irregularities are related to development programs like MNREGA and mid-day Meal Scheme
 itane saalon se vibhinn vibhaagon main vibhinn staron or sthanon par karyrat sarkari adhikari sankshipt aakasmik (asi) bill ke aadhaar par vikaas nidhi se paisa nikaalte rahe
 In simple terms, the CAG report has made it clear that vouchers related to the use of funds withdrawn for various development schemes have not been deposited, which means that there is something to clarify this in the records It was also not present that the money spent has come to the right place
 sieji report 14 july, 2009 ko rajya vidhansabha main pesh kii gai thi, lekin ise vidambnaa hi kahenge ki rajya sarkaar ne bagaiyr kisi byore vaale in bhugtanon ke khilaaf kuch nahin kiya yaa kahen, pichley ek saal ke dauraan chizon ko sahi karne kii disha main bhi koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 The matter is currently with the Public Accounts Committee of the Legislative Assembly
 jab 15 july ko patna hycourt ne sieji report main saamne ain vittiya aniyamittaaon ke maamle main sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh diya to rajya sarkaar ne bhi apni kavayad tej kii
 It is worth noting that Rabri Devi was the Chief Minister of Bihar between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2005 before Nitish Kumar came to power on 24 November 2005

 The petition alleged that DC bills pending for 2002-03 and 2007-08 were not submitted to the Accountant General's Office by the concerned DDO (drawing and Disbursing Officer) despite various objections related to audit
 rajya kii ore se adaalat main supreme court ke adhivaktaa el
 Nageswara Rao argued that the CAG report, which has been put up for examination before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Legislative Assembly, is the property of the House and falls exclusively under its jurisdiction
 isliye is masale par daakhil kii gai janhit yachika ko radd kar dena chahie
 The government has also argued that pending pending DC bills do not fall into the category of irregularities as settlement of AC bills is a continuous process
 in tarkon se pare dekha jaae to maujuuda maamla naitikta kaa raag alaapne vaali nitish sarkaar ko anya purvavarti sarkaron kii shrenee main khadaa kar detaa he
 The government, which is always engrossed in self-pity, cannot easily overcome its poor financial management
 sieji ke tathyon par aadhaarit yah vivaad nitish sarkaar ke liye ek bada jhatka he
 The state government has also argued that DC bills have been found pending in various state governments and some branches of the central government as well
 udhaaharan ke liye, kendriya swasthya vibhaag ke 9,789
 14 crores Rs
 ke disi bill bhi lambit pade hai
 But here it is special that the government officials of Bihar have largely ignored the established procedures of Bihar Treasury Code
 is prakriya se judaa niyam bahut sidhaa haih asi bill ke baad disi bill diya janaa chahie jisamen us kharch se judaa vauchar hona chahie or us par varisht adhikari ke hastakshar hona bhi jaruri he
 But is this a simple case of accounting negligence? Or is there any other reality of this mess? At the moment, even experts are unable to come to any conclusion, but there are certain indicators that give some impression
 haalanki sieji report se nitish kumaar ke purvavartiyon par bhi aarope lage hai lekin unki sarkaar isliye zyada surkhiyon main he kyonki unke kaarykaal main nikaale gaye paise or uske evaj main jamaa na karaae gaye disi bilon kii sankhya bahut zyada he
 Since 2002-03, there has been a sharp jump in the amount withdrawn in lieu of AC bills, which can be understood to an extent
 lekin is tark ko kaatane vaala tathy bhi maujuud he, vah yah ki is avadhi ke dauraan asmyojit raashi main bhi ijapha hua he
 It is easy to find here that the larger the amount withdrawn, the less the deposits were deposited
 asmyojit raashi main nirantar vruddhi dekhi gai he
 The unadjusted amount 324 in 2002-03
 20 karod ru
 It was up 12 times to 3,810 in 2007-08

 Arrived at
 2007-08 main sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon ne 7,081 asi bilon ke evaj main 3,860
 47 crores Rs
 ke kharch kaa daawa kiya tha
 But when it came to justifying this expenditure, the government only 49
 63 karod ru
 Submitted only 228 detailed contingency bills
 agar ise kisi bhi paimaane se aanka jaae to yah badi raashi he or isaki andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 The ruling NDA coalition termed it simply a case of adjustment of bills and failure to account for expenditure
 duusari ore vipaksh is mudde ke jariye rajg ko chaaron khaane chit karne ke liye atyadhik vyagrata dikhaa rahaa he
 Though it has not been named a scam right now, the CAG has claimed in its report that the DC bill related to Vishal Lok Nidhi is too big to keep it hanging for a long time without any "serious financial indiscipline / irregularity"
 Can give rise to
 sieji ne ek kadam aage badhate hue bihar ko andhra pradesh sarkaar ke formule ko amal main laane ke liye kaha he, jahaan agar pehle asi bill kaa nibataan nahin kiya gaya he to vahaan lok nidhi se tisare asi bill ke jariye raashi nahin nikaali ja sakati
 The CAG report has clearly opened the box of controversies
 haalanki aniyamitataayen didio tak simit rahane vaali nahin
 Not only this, the officials of the treasury may also be pulled how they made other prepaid payments without taking utilization certificate for the payment made earlier
 isse bhi mahatvapurn yah ki kya ham afasarshahon ko audit sambandhi niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaane kii chhot dene ke liye nitish sarkaar ko maaf kar sakate hai? kya yah sambhav he ki sarkaar puri tarah se bekhbar rahe? yaa, kya yah sarkaar dwaara bharose main dhokhaa khaane kaa maamla he? ab aise tathyon kii bharmaar he jo rajg ke jununee samarthakon ke liye bhi sarkaar kaa bachaav karnaa mushkil banaakar rakh denge
 Clearly, the government would not have been completely oblivious to the irregularities that were carried out on such a large scale
 yahi nahin, rajya sarkaar kaa aantarik audit wing bhi pehle drawing or disbarsing adhikariyon dwaara is tarah kii gadabadiyon kii baat kah chukaa he
 The period for which the state government auditors had put the question mark was the period from 1989-90 to 2004-05
 is baar chaunkaane vaala tathy yah saamne aayaa he ki bihar sarkaar ne in aniyamittaaon ko paanv pasaarne kaa mauka diya
 Shouldn't a government claiming good governance in Bihar have been extra cautious as the state has already been infamous for scams? For example, a flood scam in which funds released for flood relief work were disturbed
 iskaa khulaasa us samay ho sakaa jab asi bilon ke evaj main jari kiye gaye vaucharon kii jaanch hui
 The common argument given about this may be that many audit objections can be quite complex to investigate
 2006 main, hycourt ke ek anya adhivaktaa mahendra prasad gupta ne gaban kii gai raashi ke bare main jaankaree dene ke liye janhit yachika daayar karke nyaayik hastkshep kii maang kii thi-rajya sarkaar ke auditoron ke mutabik yah raashi lagbhag 1,700 karod ru
 Had
 baad main 2008 main hycourt ne rajya sarkaar dwaara karrwai report jamaa karaane or gadabadi kii gai raashi ke bare main uchit kaarywahi karne ke sarkaar ke vaade ke baad yachika kaa nibatara kar diya tha
 The question here arises as to how the state government can ignore the objections of the CAG, even though in the past it has promised to address the irregularities introduced by the state auditors
 baharhaal, ateet main bhi bihar kii rajg sarkaar alag-alag maamalon main sarkari paise hadapney ke aarope main didio ke khilaaf praathmikiyaan darj kara chuki he
 In this perspective, one is forced to think that how can the facts presented by the CAG be ignored in the present when an FIR has been filed in such cases in the past? The Bihar government has refused to learn the lesson
 sieji report kahati he ki usne akele march 2007 main 3,849
 30 crores Rs
 ke kul kharch main se 2,375
 04 crores Rs
 sankshipt aakasmik bill par nikaale the
 Apparently this was done at the end of the financial year to not allow the fund to go waste
 lekin, isane audit or account ke niyamon ke makasad ko hi bemaani kar diya
 So what are the state agencies doing? Ram Vilas Paswan, head of the Lok Janshakti Party, says, "this is an upper assessment because state agencies cannot get to the bottom of the case
" iske liye kendriya jaanch kii jarurat he
 "it is clear that the Assembly elections are on the head, due to which the political enthusiasts in the state are intensifying, but the recent sight in the Bihar Assembly was the result of the controversy over the CAG report
 bihar ke vipakshi dalon ne, jo abhi tak nitish kii chaalon kaa jawaab dene main sakasham nahin the, is mudde ko hathohath lapak liya
 An example of this was also seen in the state assembly

 After a lot of uproar and other controversial situations, 67 opposition mlas were suspended and removed from the assembly
 is vivaad se raajnneetik hit saadhane ke liye sabase aage najar aa rahe rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne kaha, jab 2006 kii sieji report main aniyamitataayen dikhaai gayi thi to bihar sarkaar ne khud se karrwai kyon nahin kii? nitish kumaar ko sibiai jaanch puri hone tak pad se istipha de dena chahie
 In the midst of all this, Nitish Kumar, while speaking to reporters, refused to talk about the matter and said that it would not be right to talk on this issue out of court
 unhone istife kii vipakshi maang par chutki lete hue kaha, ''unki khushrahmi kshanik sabit hogi
 "of course Nitish uttered brave words
 lekin jis uthkanthaa ke saath unki sarkaar ne sibiai jaanch kaa virodh kiya usase ye sanket milte hai ki ve jaanate hai ki sieji vivaad unhen aagaamee chunaav main kis tarah kaa nu

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government on Thursday 1 in auto fares to woo 90,000 auto rickshaw drivers
 50 rupee prati kilometre kii badhotaree kii he
 The government approved this decision during a cabinet meeting on Thursday
 saath hi saath sarkaar ne base fere kiraye par bani kiraaya samiksha samiti kii anya sifarish ko bhi manjuur kar liya he
 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot said that the Rs 25 for the initial two kilometers will now be applicable for the first one and a half kilometers
 gahalot ne kaha ki parivahan vibhaag kii adhisuchana ke baad nayi daron ko lagu kiya jayega or kiraaya meter main badlaav kiya jayega
 To implement the cabinet decision with immediate effect, a letter will be written to the department regarding notification
 shahar main autoricshaw kaa maujuuda kiraaya prati kilometre 8 rupee he, jise badhaakar 9
 50 has been reduced to Rs
 kiraye main yah 18
 There is a 75 percent increase
 aapako bataa den, pichhali baar auto kiraaya 2013 main shila dikshit sarkaar ke samay badhaayaa gaya tha
 AAP Kakia was strongly supported by the autorickshaw drivers in 2013 and 2015, in the first election of Aam Aadmi Party in 2013 and again in February 2015, the autorickshaw drivers strongly supported the party
 haalanki kai kaarnon ko lekar auto chaalkon kii ek samiti unase naaraaz ho gai thi
 Some of these issues are related to non-increase in auto fares, and some not to curb cab service
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki dilli sarkaar dwaara yah kadam apane vot bank ko lubhaane ke liye uthaaya gaya he
 Sources, however, say that the Transport Department cannot issue a notification for fare hike without the permission of the Lt
 Governor
 auto chaalkon kaa sahaara leti ai he aam aadmi partismiti ne vatting charge jo abhi maujuuda haal main 50 paise prati minute he use badhaakar 75 paise prati minute karne kaa suzav diya or 15 minute ke nunatam intjaar samay seemaa ko bhi hataa diya he
 At the same time, the union of auto drivers called this increase in fares insufficient and asked to curb irregular app based cab services
 bataa den, aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main prachaar ke liye aam aadmi party ne auto campagne kaa sahaara liya he
 The Delhi government targeted the BJP in January through a new poster on auto
 poster main ek line likhi he, 'bhaajapa ko haraana chaahate hai? to aam aadmi party ko hi vot den'
 In this way also the Delhi government has been resorting to auto drivers

 It was a Sunday holiday due to Sunday, but many children came to play there

 "therefore, use the time properly and take these Gurmantras into the depths of the heart: * He who wastes time wastes time
 isliye samay kaa sahi upyog kiijie or duniya ko minuton main jeet lijie
 * People say that no one has been found before time and more than luck and no one will get it, but i say that just walk with time, then luck will spread wealth in your footsteps
 * kathin kaam thodaa samay letaa he or asambhav kaam kuch adhik samay letaa he
 So believe in yourself and be determined to do the impossible
 * sawaal paise kaa nahin hai, sawaal paisa banane kaa he
 So don't talk about luck
 samay kaa sahi istemaal kiijie or maukey kaa phayda uthaaie, phir aap vijeta ban sakate hai
 * Do not make dreams of dreams, do not decorate flowers with buds
 paharaa laga saktaa he khuda aap par, abhi vakt he sanbhal jaao
 * God gives three opportunities for success in every person's life
 pehla bachapan main, doosraa javaani main or teesraa budhaape main
 But successful is the one who takes advantage of any one opportunity in time
 * aapkaa dimag ek samay main keval ek hi vichaar rakh saktaa he, jo sakaaratmak bhi ho saktaa he or nakaaratmak bhi, lekin aap nakaaratmak soch ko sakaaratmak soch main badal sakate hai, kyonki aap sabakuch kar sakate hai
 * It is only when the time comes that the properties are tested, so wait for the appropriate time to reveal the properties
 * samay ek tarah se dhan he, jise yaa to kharch kiya ja saktaa he yaa uskaa nivesh kiya ja saktaa he
 If you invest time wisely, then you can succeed
 * paise kii jarurat samay ke saath badalati rahati he, lekin yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki us vakt aapkaa jivan kis padaav par he or safalataa paane ke liye aap koun sa vikalp chunate hai
 * There are only four good habits in the world, that is, observance of time, true vision, duty and work efficiency
 inhen chaar aadaton ke bal par manushya safalataa praapt karata he
 * The most important measure of measuring time is speed, which steals time, then steals your life

 yahaan 14 main se 12 seat jeetne kaa matlab he ki pradesh kii janata ne narendra modi ke netritv ko puri tareeke se sweekaar kar liya he or bhaajapa ke samarthan main khulkar matdaan kiya
 In Jharkhand, BJP and AJSU alliance got 55 percent votes

 Let me tell you that they did not have an alliance in 2014 and the All Students Union fought a separate election

 The central bank reduced the risk holder from 75 percent to 50 percent for housing loans above Rs 75 lakh

 (also from input language) (input bhashaa se bhi) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has termed Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde as clean in the Adarsh housing Society scam
 jaanch agency ne bombai ucch nyaayalay se kaha ki aisa koi saboot nahin he, jisase yah pataa chalata ho ki scindia ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan janasevak ke rup main apane pad kaa durupyog kiya
 The CBI responded by filing an affidavit in response to the application of social activist Praveen Wategaonkar
 praveen ne maang kii thi ki scindia ko is maamle main bataur aaropee shaamil kiya jaae, kyonki dakshin mumbai kii 31 manzili adarsh imaarat main unka benami flats he
 The affidavit states that the CBI does not feel legally required to include Sushil Kumar Shinde as an accused in its present investigation
 vaategankar ke aavedan ke anusaar scindia ne hi divangat major en dablyoo khankhoje ko adarsh sosayadi main sadsy ke rup main shaamil karne kaa suzav diya tha
 Kanhaiyalal Gidwani, a former member of the Legislative Council, had said in his testimony before the Adarsh commission that Shinde had asked Khankhoje to be included as a member
 halafname main kaha gaya he, ho saktaa he ki khankhoje kii sadsyta ke liye keel gidwani ne baat aage badhaai, lekin isaki pushti nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki gidwani guzar chuke hai
 The comments sibiai kaa aaropapatr kahata he ki sosayadi main asainya sadsy gidwani ke kehane par shaamil kiye gaye the
 In the affidavit of senior CBI officer k Babu, the CBI investigation did not reveal any family relations between Khankhoje and Shinde
 ricard main aisa kuch nahin he, jo ayog ke samaksh gidwani dwaara di gai is gavaahi kii pushti kare ki susheel kumaar scindia ke kehane par khankhoj shaamil kiye gaye the
 The affidavit states that no such evidence was found in the investigation which suggests that Shinde misused his position as a public servant by colluding with Adarsh's office bearers to benefit someone from the Khankhoje family
 sibiai ne saamaajik kaaryakarta praveen vaategankar ke aavedan ke jawaab main ek halafanama daayar kar yah jawaab diya
 Praveen demanded that Shinde be included as an accused in the case as he owns a benami flat in the 31-storey Adarsh building in South Mumbai
 halafname main kaha gaya gaya he, sibiai apni vartmaan jaanch main susheel kumaar scindia ko bataur aaropee shaamil karne ko kanoonee rup se jaruri nahin mahasoos karti
 According to Wategaonkar's application, it was Shinde who suggested the inclusion of the late Major NW Khankhoje as a member in the Adarsh society
 vidhaan parishad ke purv sadsy kanhaiyalaal gidwani ne adarsh ayog ke samaksh apni gavaahi main kaha tha ki scindia ne hi khankhoje ko bataur sadsy shaamil karne ko kaha tha
 The affidavit states that KL Gidwani may have moved forward for membership of Khankhoje, but this cannot be confirmed as Gidwani has passed
 tippaniyan The CBI chargesheet says that civil society members were included at the behest of Gidwani
 varisht sibiai adhikari ke babu ke halafname main kaha gaya he, sibiai kii jaanch main khankhoje or scindia ke kisi paariwarik sambandh kaa pataa nahin chalaa

 jab bhi ham yah maanane lagate hai ki bharat kii raajnneeti ab event management se hi chalegi tabhi bharat kii janata galat sabit kar detii he
 It seems that he is adamant that in politics democracy will not be allowed to run with management
 raajnneeti chalegi to sirf or sirf uske buniyadi muddon se
 When you started the discussion of Rahul Gandhi's cot, everyone kept talking about the cot
 kisaanon ke mudde ko media main kam hi jagah mili
 Probably also because in the media too, there is neither patience in the issue of farmers nor trust of the leaders that they are really concerned about the farmers in an honest way
 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle mahilaon or kisaanon ke saath chaay pe charchaa pradhanmantri modi kaa brands ban gaya
 Since the Anna movement, the strategy of the event began to dominate the electoral strategy in Indian politics
 soshal media ke zariye us event ko or bada kiya jane laga
 The hashtag was converted into a movement and the news channels were replaced with debates
 kaha jane laga ki falaan netaa yaa party ke paas team nahin he
 Only a leader can be born from the team
 pradhanmantri ne to videsh yatraaon ke samay stadium ko nae manch ke rup main istemaal kiya jahaan vaktaa or uski awaz ko bhavy rup diya ja sake, isliye raajnneetik dal bhi chunavi prabandhakon kii team ke bagair chunaav main jane se ghabaraane lage hai
 The belief of political parties is becoming deepened that the air which will be tied through social media and media, people will leave their question and start thinking of that air as cooler and air conditioned
 lekin aaj bhi raajnneeti tay karne kaa adhikaar or avasar abhi bhi janata ke paas he
 If there is no media, political parties should not be honest on those issues, even then the people's movement can stand
 gujarat main jab gaurakshakon ne dalit yuvakon ko maaraa to unke kilaaf gussa channelon kii bahes se nahin bhadkaa
 Political parties felt that the media is not showing and if all parties are silent then the public will be silent
 lekin hua ulta
 The Dalits of Gujarat also came up with an aggressive idea from the Khat Sabha and Chai Pe discussion and refused to remove the skin of the dead cow
 bina kisi sthapit netaa ke ahmedabad or una main log jamaa ho gaye
 The same situation was also with the Patel movement
 jab tak media kii nazar padati yah andolan aakraamak ho chukaa tha
 Along with the demand for reservation, one of the main grounds of this was that fees are getting expensive and the jobs one gets are very low in proportion to the fees
 netaaon or charchaakaron ne aarakshan ko to mukhya mudda bana diya lekin baaki muddon par sab chup rah gaye
 Now there is a similar movement going on in Maharashtra which has not been created by any event company
 is andolan kaa koi netaa nahin he
 There is no speech in this movement
 koi manch nahin banataa he
 Millions of Maratha people leave and return to their homes after a long rally
 ham isi raily ke bare main baat karenge
 On July 14, a Round Table Council of Maratha Samaj organizations was being held at the Residency Club in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, when the news of a July 13 incident in which a Maratha girl was allegedly raped by three Dalit boys and boys Had threatened to implicate the SC ST Atrocity Act
 is khabar ne golmes parishad kii disha hi badal di
 At that meeting some thirty organizations from all over the state working for Maratha society were called
 samajashastri, itihaaskaar or patrkaar bhi the
 Twenty issues related to society were being discussed there
 golmes parishad ko bulaane vaale bahujan andolan or foole shahu ambedkar vichaardhaara ke log hai
 Their motive was that the influence of Brahminical rituals in Maratha society is increasing
 log tivi ke zariye popular hone vaale baabaaon ke prabhaav main aa rahe hai
 Society will have to be saved from this
 iske alaava vahaan do sabase bade mudde the
 One is that 90 percent of the farmers who commit suicide are Marathas
 gaanvon se duusari jatiyaan palaayan kar rahi hai magar maratha kisaan gaanv main marane ke liye majaboor hai
 Maratha leaders do not solve the problems of these farmers by taking Maratha votes
 isi ke saath maratha yuvaaon kaa mudda tha ki ejineering, medical or anya profeshnal course kii fees bahut mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 OBC and SC get fee waiver and scholarship
 maratha yuvakon ke garib tabake ko chaatravrutti to milti he lekin baaki yuvaaon ko nahin milti he
 Because of this, these youth are starting to blame reservation
 yuvaaon kaa gussa is baat ko lekar bhi he ki koi bhi raajnneetik dal mahangi shiksha ko awaz nahin de rahaa he
 If this is true, from the Patel agitation in Gujarat to the Maratha movement in Maharashtra, it is telling that our politicians only do youth but remain silent on expensive education
 yuvaaon kaa raajnneetik dalon ko chhod saamaajik sanghathanon kii taraf janaa yah bataa rahaa he ki raajnneetik dalon main unka bharosa kitna kam hua he
 They are beginning to believe that no party or leader can be honest on expensive fees
 maratha andolan zarur aarakshan maangane or essi asti atrosity act ke durupyog ko lekar mukhar he yaa ise hi ubhaara ja rahaa he
 When i spoke to a gentleman associated with this movement, he told that the demand letter being given by the movement to the Collector, it is not a matter of abolishing the SC ST Atrocity Act, but to stop misuse
 in maangon or kopradih balaatkaar cond ko lekar ahmednagar main koi 10-12 sanghathanon ne march nikaala
 Only 10–12 thousand people attended
 use media ne notice nahin liya
 After that the march started in Aurangabad
 media ne halkaa-phulka notice liya, lekin is baat ko lekar maratha samaaj gusse main aa gaya ki lakhon logon kii raily hui or media ne andekha kar diya
 So it has been decided that now we will not depend on the media, but through social media, the talk will be spread
 jalgaanv ke mook march ko drone se shoot kiya gaya, isliye aap mook march se sambadhit jitani bhi tasviren dekhenge zyaadaatar oonchai se lee gai hai
 These pictures started filling the sense of number and its strength
 maratha samaaj ko laga ki bina netaa ke bhi unki raily safal ho rahi he
 The media kept quiet but people started talking
 jalgaanv ke baad bid or parabhani main mook morcha niklaa, jisamen lakhon log aae
 In Aurangabad rally, the outline of this movement was decided that no leader would be on the stage
 hoga bhi to sabase peeche chalegaa
 There will be no speech, no slogan
 iske liye koi event management kii company nahin bulaai gai balki logon ne aapas main hi vichaar-vimarsh kar tay kiya
 That is to come in black T-shirt or clothes from home
 ab to ye tishart bikne bhi lagi he
 One hundred and twenty two hundred t-shirts have been launched
 sar par kaale riban baandh kar nikalnaa he taaki lage ki virodh march main aae hai
 Most said that he brought the saffron flag in his hand
 shivaji se judaa hua jhanda
 You will see in many pictures that the silent march is full of saffron flags
 in jhandon kii tasviir khaas angel se lee gai he, taaki ek taqatvar samooh hone kaa sandesh jaae
 The silent front will only have an authorized poster
 koi apni taraf se binar lekar nahin ja saktaa
 It is decided by who will be in the front
 sabase pehle chatraayen, uske baad mahilaayein, mahila netaa, yuva, purush, purushon kaa bhi kram tay he, vakil, shikshak, ejeeniyar, vyapaaree, phir rajkeey netaa, swatchta kaaryakarta or aayojak
 The entire team is there to pick up the trash
 yah morcha khatm hone ke baad kaale kapadon main ladkiyaan colector ko apana mangapatr saunpti hai
 Now a water bottle has also come in the name of silent morta
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis is saying that the government is serious about reservation, but going beyond reservation, i am together to solve the problems of the society
 gaanvon main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 It is alleged that the Congress NCP is promoting the silent front
 sharad pavaar ne atrocity act samaapt karne kii maang kii he lekin in dalon ko bhi pataa he ki mook morcha kaa raajnneetik istamaal kaise karen, yah baat samaj nahin aa rahi he
 Will this front make Maratha society and Dalit society face to face? yah sabase bada sawaal he, maharashtra kii raajnneeti main mook morcha ne ashanka or kautuhal donon paidaa kar diya he
 Prakash Ambedkar of Bharip Bahujan Federation said that mook morcha daliton ke kilaaf nahin he
 This is his fight with his government
 mook morcha ke kilaaf koi virdohi march nahin nikalegaa
 Dalits should not get into this
 kendriya mantri ramdaas athavle ne shuru main aakraamak stand liya tha magar ab arpiai takaraav nahin chaahati
 Athawale and Prakash Ambedkar say that the demand to abolish the SC ST Atrocity Act is not and will not be right
 prakaash ambedkar ne kaha he ki congress, ensipi ko agar samasya he to atrosity act main sanshodhan kaa prastaav sansad main pesh kar dikhaae
 The comments buudhvaar ko navi mumbai main bhi mook morcha niklaa
 Solapur also came in large numbers in March
 har jagah sthaneey maratha samaaj hi isamen shirkat rahaa he
 The silent front has been coming out since mid-july and will be out by the end of October
 pune, washim, buldhana, baraamati, kai shaharon main mook morcha nikalegaa
 The biggest front will emerge in Satara, which is considered the capital of Shivaji Maharaj
 'ek maratha lakh maratha' kaa naaraa diya gaya he
 Everywhere the target of the crowd is being sent to the people through Whats Up
 maratha samaaj puch rahaa he ki maharashtra main itane saalon tak maratha netaaon kaa hi raaj rahaa phir bhi unki haalat kharaab kyon hai
 There is also a demand of the silent front that according to the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee on agriculture, they should be given the right
 yani kisaan ko laagat main pachaas fisadi jodakar munafa dene kii guarantee
 The BJP had promised in the Lok Sabha elections
 rahul gandhi is maang ko upi main uthaa rahe hai magar vahaan jor nahin pakad paa rahaa he, maharashtra main sab chup hai lekin vahaan yah maang saamaajik sanghathanon ke manch par jagah paa rahi he
 Since it has been decided that no one will speak on behalf of the organization, therefore no organizer is speaking
 sarkaar bhi hairaan he kisase baat kare
 There are two questions in 'prime time'
 aarakshan or atrosity act kaa sawaal mahatvapurn to he hi lekin kya ye bada sawaal nahin he ki jin muddon par raajnneetik dalon ko eemaandaar hona chahie wo ab saamaajik manchon se uthaaye ja rahe hai
 Is this not an indication that public confidence in political parties is declining? aapane rahul gandhi kii khaat charchaa shuru kii to sab khaat ko lekar hi baat karte rahe
 The issue of farmers was rarely found in the media
 shaayad isliye bhi ki media main bhi kisaanon ke mudde ko lekar na to dhiraj bachaa he or na hi netaaon kii baton par bharosa ki vaaki ye eemaandaar tareeke se kisaanon ko lekar chintit hai
 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, discussions on tea with women and farmers became Prime Minister Modi's brand
 anna andolan ke baad se bhartiya raajnneeti main chunavi ranneeti par event kii ranneeti haaavee hone lagi
 The event started to be magnified through social media
 hashtag ko andolan main badalakar news channelon par bahes kii jagah banaai jane lagi
 It was said that such and such leader or party does not have a team
 team se hi netaa paidaa ho saktaa he
 The Prime Minister even used the stadium as a new platform during foreign visits where the speaker and his voice could be given a grand appearance, so political parties are also nervous about going to the polls without a team of electoral managers
 raajnneetik dalon kaa yah vishwaas gaharaa hota ja rahaa he ki soshal media or media ke zariye jo hawa baandhi jaaegi, janata apana sawaal chhodkar us hawa ko cooler or airkandishan kii hawa samajhane lagegi
 But even today the public has the right and opportunity to decide politics
 media na ho, raajnneetik dal un muddon par eemaandaar na rahen tab bhi janandolan khadey ho sakate hai
 In Gujarat, when the gau rakshaks killed Dalit youth, anger against them was not provoked by the debate on the channels
 raajnneetik dalon ko laga ki media dikhaa nahin rahaa he or saare dal chup hai to janata chup rahegi
 But the opposite happened
 gujarat ke daliton ne khaat sabha or chaay pe charchaa se bhi aakraamak idia nikaala or mari hui gaay kii khaal utaarne se manaa kar diya
 People gathered in Ahmedabad and Una without an established leader
 vahi haal patel andolan kaa bhi tha
 By the time the media noticed this movement had become aggressive
 aarakshan kii maang ke saath-saath iskaa ek mukhya aadhaar yah bhi tha ki fees mahangi hoti ja rahi he or naukari jo milti he wo fees ke anupaat main kaaphi kam selary vaali hoti he
 Leaders and discussants made reservation the main issue, but everyone remained silent on the remaining issues
 ab maharashtra main ek aisa hi andolan chal rahaa he jise kisi eenvet company ne nahin rachaa he
 There is no leader of this movement
 is andolan main koi bhaashan nahin hota he
 No stage is formed
 lakhon kii sankhya main maratha samaaj ke log nikalate hai or lambii raily kar apane ghar laut jate hai
 We will talk about this rally
 14 july ko maharashtra ke kolhapur ke residency club main maratha samaaj se jude sanghathanon kii ek golmes parishad ho rahi thi, tabhi 13 july kii ek ghatana kii khabar pahunchi jisamen ek maratha ladki ke saath kathith rup se teen dalit ladakon ne balaatkaar kiya he or ladakon ne essi asti atrocity act main fansaane kii dhamkee di thi
 This news changed the direction of the Round Table Council itself
 us baithak main maratha samaaj ke liye kaam karne vaale puure pradesh bhar se koi tees sanghathan bulaae gaye the
 There were also sociologists, historians and journalists
 vahaan samaaj se jude bees mudde par charchaa ho rahi thi
 The Bahujan movement and Phule Shahu Ambedkar, who called the Round Table Council, are people of ideology
 inkaa makasad yahi tha ki maratha samaaj main brahmanvaadi karmkaandon kaa asar badhata ja rahaa he
 People are coming under the influence of babas who are popular through TV
 isse samaaj ko bachaana hoga
 Apart from this there were two biggest issues
 ek yah ki aatmahatya karne vaala 90 fisadi kisaan maratha he
 Other castes are migrating from the villages but Maratha farmers are forced to die in the village
 maratha ke vot lekar maratha netaa in kisaanon kii samasya kaa hal nahin karte hai
 Along with this, the issue of Maratha youth was that the fees for engineering, medical and other professional courses are becoming very expensive
 obisi or anusuchit jati ko fees maafee or chaatravrutti milti he
 The poor section of Maratha youth get scholarship but the rest of the youth do not
 is kaaran ye yuva aarakshan ko doshi maanane lage hai
 The anger of the youth is also about the fact that no political party is giving voice to expensive education
 agar yah baat sahi he to gujarat ke patel andolan se lekar maharashtra ke maratha andolan tak yahi bataa rahe hai ki hamaare raajnneetik sirf yuva-yuva karte hai magar mahangi shiksha par chuppi saadh jate hai
 The youth's move from political parties to social organizations is showing how much their trust in political parties has decreased
 wo yah maanane lage hai ki mahangi fees par koi dal yaa netaa eemaandaar ho hi nahin saktaa he
 The Maratha movement must have been vocal about the demand for reservation and misuse of the SC ST Atrocity Act or it is being raised
 is andolan se jude ek sajjan se maine baat kii to unhone bataaya ki andolan kii taraf se jo maang patr colector ko diya ja rahaa he, usamen essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii baat nahin he, balki durupyog rokane kii baat he
 Some 10-12 organizations marched in Ahmednagar on these demands and the Koparadih rape scandal
 10-12 hazaar log hi shaamil hue
 The media did not take notice of him
 uske baad aurangabad main march niklaa
 The media took lighthearted notice, but the Maratha society became angry over the fact that lakhs of people rallied and the media ignored it
 lihaaza tay hua ki ab media par nirbhar nahin rahenge balki soshal media ke zariye baat failaai jaaegi
 Jalgaon's silent march was shot with a drone, so all the pictures you will see related to the silent march are mostly taken from a height
 in tasveeron se sankhya or uski takat kaa bhav bharne laga
 Maratha society felt that their rally was being successful even without a leader
 media chup rahaa magar log baaten karne lage
 After Jalgaon, a silent front broke out in Beed and Parbhani, in which lakhs of people came
 aurangabad kii raily main is andolan kii ruparekha tay ho gai ki koi netaa manch par nahin hoga
 Even if it is, it will follow
 bhaashan nahin hoga, naaraa nahin lagegaa
 No event management company was called for this, but people decided among themselves
 yahi ki ghar se kaale tii shart yaa kapade main aana he
 Now this t-shirt has started selling
 dedh sau se do sau kaa tii shart launch ho gaya he

 Flag attached to Shivaji
 aap kai tasveeron main dekhenge ki mook march main bhagava jhande kii bharmaar he
 The picture of these flags is taken from a particular angle, so that the message of being a powerful group is sent
 mook morcha main sirf adhikrut poster hoga
 No one can carry a banner on their behalf
 morche main koun kahaan hoga yah yab tay hota he
 First the students, then women, women leaders, youth, men, men are also in the order, lawyers, teachers, engineers, businessmen, then state leaders, sanitation workers and organizers
 kachra uthaane ke liye puri team hoti he
 After this front is over, girls in dark clothes submit their indent to the collector
 ab to mook morta ke naam se pani kii bottle bhi aa gai he
 You can see in these pictures
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri fadanvis kah rahe hai ki aarakshan ke prati sarkaar gambhir he, lekin aarakshan se bhi aage jaakar samaaj kii samasyaon ke hal ke liye saath hum
 i am trying to generate employment in the villages
 aarope he ki mook morcha ko congress en si pi badhaava de rahe hai
 Sharad Pawar has demanded the abolition of the Atrocity Act, but these parties also know how to use the Silent Front politically, it is not understood
 kya yah morcha maratha samaaj or dalit samaaj ko aamane saamne khadaa kar degaa
 This is the biggest question, in Maharashtra politics, the silent front has created both apprehension and curiosity
 bharip bahujan mahasang ke prakaash ambedkar ne kaha ki The silent front is not against Dalits
 yah unki sarkaar se apni ladaai he
 There will be no anti-march march against the silent front
 daliton ko is maamle main nahin padana chahie
 Union minister Ramdas Athawale had taken an aggressive stand initially but now the RPI does not want a confrontation
 athavle or prakaash ambedkar kaa kahana he essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii maang sahi nahin he or na hoga
 Prakash Ambedkar has said that if Congress, NCP has a problem then they should present a proposal for amendment of the Atrocities Act in Parliament
 tippaniyan a silent front came out in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday
 sholapur main bhi badi sankhya main log march main aae
 Everywhere the local Maratha society has participated in it
 madhya july se mook morcha nikal rahaa he or abhi oktober ke aakhir tak nikalegaa
 In Pune, Washim, Buldhana, Baramati, a silent front will emerge in many cities
 sabase bada morcha satara main nikalegaa jise shivaji maharaj kii rajdhani mana jaataa he
 The slogan 'ek Maratha Lakh Maratha' has been given
 har jagah bheed kaa target whats ap ke zariye logon tak bheja ja rahaa he
 Maratha society is asking why Maratha leaders have ruled in Maharashtra for so many years, yet why their condition is bad
 mook morcha kii ek maang yah bhi he ki kheti ko lekar swaminathan cameti kii siforeeshon ke hisaab se unhen haq diya jaae
 That is, a guarantee of giving profits to the farmer by adding fifty percent of the cost
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main vaada kiya tha
 Rahul Gandhi is raising this demand in UP but is not able to hold it there, everyone is silent in Maharashtra but this demand is finding a place on the platform of social organizations
 chunki tay hua he ki sanghathan kii taraf se koi nahin bolegaa isliye koi aayojak bol hi nahin rahaa he
 The government is also surprised with whom to talk
 'prime time' main do sawaal hai
 The question of the Reservation and Atrocity Act is important but is it not a big question that the issues on which political parties should be honest are now being raised from social forums
 kya yah sanket nahin he ki raajnneetik dalon ke prati janata kaa bharosa kam hota ja rahaa he
 The belief of political parties is becoming deepened that the air which will be tied through social media and media, people will leave their question and start thinking of that air as cooler and air conditioned
 lekin aaj bhi raajnneeti tay karne kaa adhikaar or avasar abhi bhi janata ke paas he
 If there is no media, political parties should not be honest on those issues, even then the people's movement can stand
 gujarat main jab gaurakshakon ne dalit yuvakon ko maaraa to unke kilaaf gussa channelon kii bahes se nahin bhadkaa
 Political parties felt that the media is not showing and if all parties are silent then the public will be silent
 lekin hua ulta
 The Dalits of Gujarat also came up with an aggressive idea from the Khat Sabha and Chai Pe discussion and refused to remove the skin of the dead cow
 bina kisi sthapit netaa ke ahmedabad or una main log jamaa ho gaye
 The same situation was also with the Patel movement
 jab tak media kii nazar padati yah andolan aakraamak ho chukaa tha
 Along with the demand for reservation, one of the main grounds of this was that fees are getting expensive and the jobs one gets are very low in proportion to the fees
 netaaon or charchaakaron ne aarakshan ko to mukhya mudda bana diya lekin baaki muddon par sab chup rah gaye
 Now there is a similar movement going on in Maharashtra which has not been created by any event company
 is andolan kaa koi netaa nahin he
 There is no speech in this movement
 koi manch nahin banataa he
 Millions of Maratha people leave and return to their homes after a long rally
 ham isi raily ke bare main baat karenge
 On July 14, a Round Table Council of Maratha Samaj organizations was being held at the Residency Club in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, when the news of a July 13 incident in which a Maratha girl was allegedly raped by three Dalit boys and boys Had threatened to implicate the SC ST Atrocity Act
 is khabar ne golmes parishad kii disha hi badal di
 At that meeting some thirty organizations from all over the state working for Maratha society were called
 samajashastri, itihaaskaar or patrkaar bhi the
 Twenty issues related to society were being discussed there
 golmes parishad ko bulaane vaale bahujan andolan or foole shahu ambedkar vichaardhaara ke log hai
 Their motive was that the influence of Brahminical rituals in Maratha society is increasing
 log tivi ke zariye popular hone vaale baabaaon ke prabhaav main aa rahe hai
 Society will have to be saved from this
 iske alaava vahaan do sabase bade mudde the
 One is that 90 percent of the farmers who commit suicide are Marathas
 gaanvon se duusari jatiyaan palaayan kar rahi hai magar maratha kisaan gaanv main marane ke liye majaboor hai
 Maratha leaders do not solve the problems of these farmers by taking Maratha votes
 isi ke saath maratha yuvaaon kaa mudda tha ki ejineering, medical or anya profeshnal course kii fees bahut mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 OBC and SC get fee waiver and scholarship
 maratha yuvakon ke garib tabake ko chaatravrutti to milti he lekin baaki yuvaaon ko nahin milti he
 Because of this, these youth are starting to blame reservation
 yuvaaon kaa gussa is baat ko lekar bhi he ki koi bhi raajnneetik dal mahangi shiksha ko awaz nahin de rahaa he
 If this is true, from the Patel agitation in Gujarat to the Maratha movement in Maharashtra, it is telling that our politicians only do youth but remain silent on expensive education
 yuvaaon kaa raajnneetik dalon ko chhod saamaajik sanghathanon kii taraf janaa yah bataa rahaa he ki raajnneetik dalon main unka bharosa kitna kam hua he
 They are beginning to believe that no party or leader can be honest on expensive fees
 maratha andolan zarur aarakshan maangane or essi asti atrosity act ke durupyog ko lekar mukhar he yaa ise hi ubhaara ja rahaa he
 When i spoke to a gentleman associated with this movement, he told that the demand letter being given by the movement to the Collector, it is not a matter of abolishing the SC ST Atrocity Act, but to stop misuse
 in maangon or kopradih balaatkaar cond ko lekar ahmednagar main koi 10-12 sanghathanon ne march nikaala
 Only 10–12 thousand people attended
 use media ne notice nahin liya
 After that the march started in Aurangabad
 media ne halkaa-phulka notice liya, lekin is baat ko lekar maratha samaaj gusse main aa gaya ki lakhon logon kii raily hui or media ne andekha kar diya
 So it has been decided that now we will not depend on the media, but through social media, the talk will be spread
 jalgaanv ke mook march ko drone se shoot kiya gaya, isliye aap mook march se sambadhit jitani bhi tasviren dekhenge zyaadaatar oonchai se lee gai hai
 These pictures started filling the sense of number and its strength
 maratha samaaj ko laga ki bina netaa ke bhi unki raily safal ho rahi he
 The media kept quiet but people started talking
 jalgaanv ke baad bid or parabhani main mook morcha niklaa, jisamen lakhon log aae
 In Aurangabad rally, the outline of this movement was decided that no leader would be on the stage
 hoga bhi to sabase peeche chalegaa
 There will be no speech, no slogan
 iske liye koi event management kii company nahin bulaai gai balki logon ne aapas main hi vichaar-vimarsh kar tay kiya
 That is to come in black T-shirt or clothes from home
 ab to ye tishart bikne bhi lagi he
 One hundred and twenty two hundred t-shirts have been launched
 sar par kaale riban baandh kar nikalnaa he taaki lage ki virodh march main aae hai
 Most said that he brought the saffron flag in his hand
 shivaji se judaa hua jhanda
 You will see in many pictures that the silent march is full of saffron flags
 in jhandon kii tasviir khaas angel se lee gai he, taaki ek taqatvar samooh hone kaa sandesh jaae
 The silent front will only have an authorized poster
 koi apni taraf se binar lekar nahin ja saktaa
 It is decided by who will be in the front
 sabase pehle chatraayen, uske baad mahilaayein, mahila netaa, yuva, purush, purushon kaa bhi kram tay he, vakil, shikshak, ejeeniyar, vyapaaree, phir rajkeey netaa, swatchta kaaryakarta or aayojak
 The entire team is there to pick up the trash
 yah morcha khatm hone ke baad kaale kapadon main ladkiyaan colector ko apana mangapatr saunpti hai
 Now a water bottle has also come in the name of silent morta
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis is saying that the government is serious about reservation, but going beyond reservation, i am together to solve the problems of the society
 gaanvon main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 It is alleged that the Congress NCP is promoting the silent front
 sharad pavaar ne atrocity act samaapt karne kii maang kii he lekin in dalon ko bhi pataa he ki mook morcha kaa raajnneetik istamaal kaise karen, yah baat samaj nahin aa rahi he
 Will this front make Maratha society and Dalit society face to face? yah sabase bada sawaal he, maharashtra kii raajnneeti main mook morcha ne ashanka or kautuhal donon paidaa kar diya he
 Prakash Ambedkar of Bharip Bahujan Federation said that mook morcha daliton ke kilaaf nahin he
 This is his fight with his government
 mook morcha ke kilaaf koi virdohi march nahin nikalegaa
 Dalits should not get into this
 kendriya mantri ramdaas athavle ne shuru main aakraamak stand liya tha magar ab arpiai takaraav nahin chaahati
 Athawale and Prakash Ambedkar say that the demand to abolish the SC ST Atrocity Act is not and will not be right
 prakaash ambedkar ne kaha he ki congress, ensipi ko agar samasya he to atrosity act main sanshodhan kaa prastaav sansad main pesh kar dikhaae
 The comments buudhvaar ko navi mumbai main bhi mook morcha niklaa
 Solapur also came in large numbers in March
 har jagah sthaneey maratha samaaj hi isamen shirkat rahaa he
 The silent front has been coming out since mid-july and will be out by the end of October
 pune, washim, buldhana, baraamati, kai shaharon main mook morcha nikalegaa
 The biggest front will emerge in Satara, which is considered the capital of Shivaji Maharaj
 'ek maratha lakh maratha' kaa naaraa diya gaya he
 Everywhere the target of the crowd is being sent to the people through Whats Up
 maratha samaaj puch rahaa he ki maharashtra main itane saalon tak maratha netaaon kaa hi raaj rahaa phir bhi unki haalat kharaab kyon hai
 There is also a demand of the silent front that according to the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee on agriculture, they should be given the right
 yani kisaan ko laagat main pachaas fisadi jodakar munafa dene kii guarantee
 The BJP had promised in the Lok Sabha elections
 rahul gandhi is maang ko upi main uthaa rahe hai magar vahaan jor nahin pakad paa rahaa he, maharashtra main sab chup hai lekin vahaan yah maang saamaajik sanghathanon ke manch par jagah paa rahi he
 Since it has been decided that no one will speak on behalf of the organization, therefore no organizer is speaking
 sarkaar bhi hairaan he kisase baat kare
 There are two questions in 'prime time'
 aarakshan or atrosity act kaa sawaal mahatvapurn to he hi lekin kya ye bada sawaal nahin he ki jin muddon par raajnneetik dalon ko eemaandaar hona chahie wo ab saamaajik manchon se uthaaye ja rahe hai
 Is this not an indication that public confidence in political parties is declining? gujarat main jab gaurakshakon ne dalit yuvakon ko maaraa to unke kilaaf gussa channelon kii bahes se nahin bhadkaa
 Political parties felt that the media is not showing and if all parties are silent then the public will be silent

 Is this not an indication that public confidence in political parties is declining? 14 july ko maharashtra ke kolhapur ke residency club main maratha samaaj se jude sanghathanon kii ek golmes parishad ho rahi thi, tabhi 13 july kii ek ghatana kii khabar pahunchi jisamen ek maratha ladki ke saath kathith rup se teen dalit ladakon ne balaatkaar kiya he or ladakon ne essi asti atrocity act main fansaane kii dhamkee di thi
 This news changed the direction of the Round Table Council itself
 us baithak main maratha samaaj ke liye kaam karne vaale puure pradesh bhar se koi tees sanghathan bulaae gaye the
 There were also sociologists, historians and journalists
 vahaan samaaj se jude bees mudde par charchaa ho rahi thi
 The Bahujan movement and Phule Shahu Ambedkar, who called the Round Table Council, are people of ideology
 inkaa makasad yahi tha ki maratha samaaj main brahmanvaadi karmkaandon kaa asar badhata ja rahaa he
 People are coming under the influence of babas who are popular through TV
 isse samaaj ko bachaana hoga
 Apart from this there were two biggest issues
 ek yah ki aatmahatya karne vaala 90 fisadi kisaan maratha he
 Other castes are migrating from the villages but Maratha farmers are forced to die in the village
 maratha ke vot lekar maratha netaa in kisaanon kii samasya kaa hal nahin karte hai
 Along with this, the issue of Maratha youth was that the fees for engineering, medical and other professional courses are becoming very expensive
 obisi or anusuchit jati ko fees maafee or chaatravrutti milti he
 The poor section of Maratha youth get scholarship but the rest of the youth do not
 is kaaran ye yuva aarakshan ko doshi maanane lage hai
 The anger of the youth is also about the fact that no political party is giving voice to expensive education
 agar yah baat sahi he to gujarat ke patel andolan se lekar maharashtra ke maratha andolan tak yahi bataa rahe hai ki hamaare raajnneetik sirf yuva-yuva karte hai magar mahangi shiksha par chuppi saadh jate hai
 The youth's move from political parties to social organizations is showing how much their trust in political parties has decreased
 wo yah maanane lage hai ki mahangi fees par koi dal yaa netaa eemaandaar ho hi nahin saktaa he
 The Maratha movement must have been vocal about the demand for reservation and misuse of the SC ST Atrocity Act or it is being raised
 is andolan se jude ek sajjan se maine baat kii to unhone bataaya ki andolan kii taraf se jo maang patr colector ko diya ja rahaa he, usamen essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii baat nahin he, balki durupyog rokane kii baat he
 Some 10-12 organizations marched in Ahmednagar on these demands and the Koparadih rape scandal
 10-12 hazaar log hi shaamil hue
 The media did not take notice of him
 uske baad aurangabad main march niklaa
 The media took lighthearted notice, but the Maratha society became angry over the fact that lakhs of people rallied and the media ignored it
 lihaaza tay hua ki ab media par nirbhar nahin rahenge balki soshal media ke zariye baat failaai jaaegi
 Jalgaon's silent march was shot with a drone, so all the pictures you will see related to the silent march are mostly taken from a height
 in tasveeron se sankhya or uski takat kaa bhav bharne laga
 Maratha society felt that their rally was being successful even without a leader
 media chup rahaa magar log baaten karne lage
 After Jalgaon, a silent front broke out in Beed and Parbhani, in which lakhs of people came
 aurangabad kii raily main is andolan kii ruparekha tay ho gai ki koi netaa manch par nahin hoga
 Even if it is, it will follow
 bhaashan nahin hoga, naaraa nahin lagegaa
 No event management company was called for this, but people decided among themselves
 yahi ki ghar se kaale tii shart yaa kapade main aana he
 Now this t-shirt has started selling
 dedh sau se do sau kaa tii shart launch ho gaya he
 a black ribbon has to be tied on the head to indicate that the protests have come in March
 sabase kaha gaya ki ve haath main bhagava jhanda lekar aae
 Flag attached to Shivaji
 aap kai tasveeron main dekhenge ki mook march main bhagava jhande kii bharmaar he
 The picture of these flags is taken from a particular angle, so that the message of being a powerful group is sent
 mook morcha main sirf adhikrut poster hoga
 No one can carry a banner on their behalf
 morche main koun kahaan hoga yah yab tay hota he
 First the students, then women, women leaders, youth, men, men are also in the order, lawyers, teachers, engineers, businessmen, then state leaders, sanitation workers and organizers
 kachra uthaane ke liye puri team hoti he
 After this front is over, girls in dark clothes submit their indent to the collector
 ab to mook morta ke naam se pani kii bottle bhi aa gai he
 You can see in these pictures
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri fadanvis kah rahe hai ki aarakshan ke prati sarkaar gambhir he, lekin aarakshan se bhi aage jaakar samaaj kii samasyaon ke hal ke liye saath hum
 i am trying to generate employment in the villages
 aarope he ki mook morcha ko congress en si pi badhaava de rahe hai
 Sharad Pawar has demanded the abolition of the Atrocity Act, but these parties also know how to use the Silent Front politically, it is not understood
 kya yah morcha maratha samaaj or dalit samaaj ko aamane saamne khadaa kar degaa
 This is the biggest question, in Maharashtra politics, the silent front has created both apprehension and curiosity
 bharip bahujan mahasang ke prakaash ambedkar ne kaha ki The silent front is not against Dalits
 yah unki sarkaar se apni ladaai he
 There will be no anti-march march against the silent front
 daliton ko is maamle main nahin padana chahie
 Union minister Ramdas Athawale had taken an aggressive stand initially but now the RPI does not want a confrontation
 athavle or prakaash ambedkar kaa kahana he essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii maang sahi nahin he or na hoga
 Prakash Ambedkar has said that if Congress, NCP has a problem then they should present a proposal for amendment of the Atrocities Act in Parliament
 tippaniyan a silent front came out in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday
 sholapur main bhi badi sankhya main log march main aae
 Everywhere the local Maratha society has participated in it
 madhya july se mook morcha nikal rahaa he or abhi oktober ke aakhir tak nikalegaa
 In Pune, Washim, Buldhana, Baramati, a silent front will emerge in many cities
 sabase bada morcha satara main nikalegaa jise shivaji maharaj kii rajdhani mana jaataa he
 The slogan 'ek Maratha Lakh Maratha' has been given
 har jagah bheed kaa target whats ap ke zariye logon tak bheja ja rahaa he
 Maratha society is asking why Maratha leaders have ruled in Maharashtra for so many years, yet why their condition is bad
 mook morcha kii ek maang yah bhi he ki kheti ko lekar swaminathan cameti kii siforeeshon ke hisaab se unhen haq diya jaae
 That is, a guarantee of giving profits to the farmer by adding fifty percent of the cost
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main vaada kiya tha
 Rahul Gandhi is raising this demand in UP but is not able to hold it there, everyone is silent in Maharashtra but this demand is finding a place on the platform of social organizations
 chunki tay hua he ki sanghathan kii taraf se koi nahin bolegaa isliye koi aayojak bol hi nahin rahaa he
 The government is also surprised with whom to talk
 'prime time' main do sawaal hai
 The question of the Reservation and Atrocity Act is important but is it not a big question that the issues on which political parties should be honest are now being raised from social forums
 kya yah sanket nahin he ki raajnneetik dalon ke prati janata kaa bharosa kam hota ja rahaa he
 At that meeting some thirty organizations from all over the state working for Maratha society were called
 samajashastri, itihaaskaar or patrkaar bhi the
 Twenty issues related to society were being discussed there
 golmes parishad ko bulaane vaale bahujan andolan or foole shahu ambedkar vichaardhaara ke log hai
 Their motive was that the influence of Brahminical rituals in Maratha society is increasing
 log tivi ke zariye popular hone vaale baabaaon ke prabhaav main aa rahe hai
 Society will have to be saved from this
 iske alaava vahaan do sabase bade mudde the
 One is that 90 percent of the farmers who commit suicide are Marathas
 gaanvon se duusari jatiyaan palaayan kar rahi hai magar maratha kisaan gaanv main marane ke liye majaboor hai
 Maratha leaders do not solve the problems of these farmers by taking Maratha votes
 isi ke saath maratha yuvaaon kaa mudda tha ki ejineering, medical or anya profeshnal course kii fees bahut mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 OBC and SC get fee waiver and scholarship
 maratha yuvakon ke garib tabake ko chaatravrutti to milti he lekin baaki yuvaaon ko nahin milti he
 Because of this, these youth are starting to blame reservation
 yuvaaon kaa gussa is baat ko lekar bhi he ki koi bhi raajnneetik dal mahangi shiksha ko awaz nahin de rahaa he
 If this is true, from the Patel agitation in Gujarat to the Maratha movement in Maharashtra, it is telling that our politicians only do youth but remain silent on expensive education
 yuvaaon kaa raajnneetik dalon ko chhod saamaajik sanghathanon kii taraf janaa yah bataa rahaa he ki raajnneetik dalon main unka bharosa kitna kam hua he
 They are beginning to believe that no party or leader can be honest on expensive fees
 maratha andolan zarur aarakshan maangane or essi asti atrosity act ke durupyog ko lekar mukhar he yaa ise hi ubhaara ja rahaa he
 When i spoke to a gentleman associated with this movement, he told that the demand letter being given by the movement to the Collector, it is not a matter of abolishing the SC ST Atrocity Act, but to stop misuse
 in maangon or kopradih balaatkaar cond ko lekar ahmednagar main koi 10-12 sanghathanon ne march nikaala
 Only 10–12 thousand people attended
 use media ne notice nahin liya
 After that the march started in Aurangabad
 media ne halkaa-phulka notice liya, lekin is baat ko lekar maratha samaaj gusse main aa gaya ki lakhon logon kii raily hui or media ne andekha kar diya
 So it has been decided that now we will not depend on the media, but through social media, the talk will be spread
 jalgaanv ke mook march ko drone se shoot kiya gaya, isliye aap mook march se sambadhit jitani bhi tasviren dekhenge zyaadaatar oonchai se lee gai hai
 These pictures started filling the sense of number and its strength
 maratha samaaj ko laga ki bina netaa ke bhi unki raily safal ho rahi he
 The media kept quiet but people started talking
 jalgaanv ke baad bid or parabhani main mook morcha niklaa, jisamen lakhon log aae
 In Aurangabad rally, the outline of this movement was decided that no leader would be on the stage
 hoga bhi to sabase peeche chalegaa
 There will be no speech, no slogan
 iske liye koi event management kii company nahin bulaai gai balki logon ne aapas main hi vichaar-vimarsh kar tay kiya
 That is to come in black T-shirt or clothes from home
 ab to ye tishart bikne bhi lagi he
 One hundred and twenty two hundred t-shirts have been launched
 sar par kaale riban baandh kar nikalnaa he taaki lage ki virodh march main aae hai
 Most said that he brought the saffron flag in his hand
 shivaji se judaa hua jhanda
 You will see in many pictures that the silent march is full of saffron flags
 in jhandon kii tasviir khaas angel se lee gai he, taaki ek taqatvar samooh hone kaa sandesh jaae
 The silent front will only have an authorized poster
 koi apni taraf se binar lekar nahin ja saktaa
 It is decided by who will be in the front
 sabase pehle chatraayen, uske baad mahilaayein, mahila netaa, yuva, purush, purushon kaa bhi kram tay he, vakil, shikshak, ejeeniyar, vyapaaree, phir rajkeey netaa, swatchta kaaryakarta or aayojak
 The entire team is there to pick up the trash
 yah morcha khatm hone ke baad kaale kapadon main ladkiyaan colector ko apana mangapatr saunpti hai
 Now a water bottle has also come in the name of silent morta
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis is saying that the government is serious about reservation, but going beyond reservation, i am together to solve the problems of the society
 gaanvon main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 It is alleged that the Congress NCP is promoting the silent front
 sharad pavaar ne atrocity act samaapt karne kii maang kii he lekin in dalon ko bhi pataa he ki mook morcha kaa raajnneetik istamaal kaise karen, yah baat samaj nahin aa rahi he
 Will this front make Maratha society and Dalit society face to face? yah sabase bada sawaal he, maharashtra kii raajnneeti main mook morcha ne ashanka or kautuhal donon paidaa kar diya he
 Prakash Ambedkar of Bharip Bahujan Federation said that mook morcha daliton ke kilaaf nahin he
 This is his fight with his government
 mook morcha ke kilaaf koi virdohi march nahin nikalegaa
 Dalits should not get into this
 kendriya mantri ramdaas athavle ne shuru main aakraamak stand liya tha magar ab arpiai takaraav nahin chaahati
 Athawale and Prakash Ambedkar say that the demand to abolish the SC ST Atrocity Act is not and will not be right
 prakaash ambedkar ne kaha he ki congress, ensipi ko agar samasya he to atrosity act main sanshodhan kaa prastaav sansad main pesh kar dikhaae
 The comments buudhvaar ko navi mumbai main bhi mook morcha niklaa
 Solapur also came in large numbers in March
 har jagah sthaneey maratha samaaj hi isamen shirkat rahaa he
 The silent front has been coming out since mid-july and will be out by the end of October
 pune, washim, buldhana, baraamati, kai shaharon main mook morcha nikalegaa
 The biggest front will emerge in Satara, which is considered the capital of Shivaji Maharaj
 'ek maratha lakh maratha' kaa naaraa diya gaya he
 Everywhere the target of the crowd is being sent to the people through Whats Up
 maratha samaaj puch rahaa he ki maharashtra main itane saalon tak maratha netaaon kaa hi raaj rahaa phir bhi unki haalat kharaab kyon hai
 There is also a demand of the silent front that according to the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee on agriculture, they should be given the right
 yani kisaan ko laagat main pachaas fisadi jodakar munafa dene kii guarantee
 The BJP had promised in the Lok Sabha elections
 rahul gandhi is maang ko upi main uthaa rahe hai magar vahaan jor nahin pakad paa rahaa he, maharashtra main sab chup hai lekin vahaan yah maang saamaajik sanghathanon ke manch par jagah paa rahi he
 Since it has been decided that no one will speak on behalf of the organization, therefore no organizer is speaking
 sarkaar bhi hairaan he kisase baat kare
 There are two questions in 'prime time'
 aarakshan or atrosity act kaa sawaal mahatvapurn to he hi lekin kya ye bada sawaal nahin he ki jin muddon par raajnneetik dalon ko eemaandaar hona chahie wo ab saamaajik manchon se uthaaye ja rahe hai
 Is this not an indication that public confidence in political parties is declining? agar yah baat sahi he to gujarat ke patel andolan se lekar maharashtra ke maratha andolan tak yahi bataa rahe hai ki hamaare raajnneetik sirf yuva-yuva karte hai magar mahangi shiksha par chuppi saadh jate hai
 The youth's move from political parties to social organizations is showing how much their trust in political parties has decreased
 wo yah maanane lage hai ki mahangi fees par koi dal yaa netaa eemaandaar ho hi nahin saktaa he
 The Maratha movement must have been vocal about the demand for reservation and misuse of the SC ST Atrocity Act or it is being raised
 is andolan se jude ek sajjan se maine baat kii to unhone bataaya ki andolan kii taraf se jo maang patr colector ko diya ja rahaa he, usamen essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii baat nahin he, balki durupyog rokane kii baat he
 Some 10-12 organizations marched in Ahmednagar on these demands and the Koparadih rape scandal
 10-12 hazaar log hi shaamil hue
 The media did not take notice of him
 uske baad aurangabad main march niklaa
 The media took lighthearted notice, but the Maratha society became angry over the fact that lakhs of people rallied and the media ignored it
 lihaaza tay hua ki ab media par nirbhar nahin rahenge balki soshal media ke zariye baat failaai jaaegi
 Jalgaon's silent march was shot with a drone, so all the pictures you will see related to the silent march are mostly taken from a height
 in tasveeron se sankhya or uski takat kaa bhav bharne laga
 Maratha society felt that their rally was being successful even without a leader
 media chup rahaa magar log baaten karne lage
 After Jalgaon, a silent front broke out in Beed and Parbhani, in which lakhs of people came
 aurangabad kii raily main is andolan kii ruparekha tay ho gai ki koi netaa manch par nahin hoga
 Even if it is, it will follow
 bhaashan nahin hoga, naaraa nahin lagegaa
 No event management company was called for this, but people decided among themselves
 yahi ki ghar se kaale tii shart yaa kapade main aana he
 Now this t-shirt has started selling
 dedh sau se do sau kaa tii shart launch ho gaya he
 a black ribbon has to be tied on the head to indicate that the protests have come in March
 sabase kaha gaya ki ve haath main bhagava jhanda lekar aae
 Flag attached to Shivaji
 aap kai tasveeron main dekhenge ki mook march main bhagava jhande kii bharmaar he
 The picture of these flags is taken from a particular angle, so that the message of being a powerful group is sent
 mook morcha main sirf adhikrut poster hoga
 No one can carry a banner on their behalf
 morche main koun kahaan hoga yah yab tay hota he
 First the students, then women, women leaders, youth, men, men are also in the order, lawyers, teachers, engineers, businessmen, then state leaders, sanitation workers and organizers
 kachra uthaane ke liye puri team hoti he
 After this front is over, girls in dark clothes submit their indent to the collector
 ab to mook morta ke naam se pani kii bottle bhi aa gai he
 You can see in these pictures
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri fadanvis kah rahe hai ki aarakshan ke prati sarkaar gambhir he, lekin aarakshan se bhi aage jaakar samaaj kii samasyaon ke hal ke liye saath hum
 i am trying to generate employment in the villages
 aarope he ki mook morcha ko congress en si pi badhaava de rahe hai
 Sharad Pawar has demanded the abolition of the Atrocity Act, but these parties also know how to use the Silent Front politically, it is not understood
 kya yah morcha maratha samaaj or dalit samaaj ko aamane saamne khadaa kar degaa
 This is the biggest question, in Maharashtra politics, the silent front has created both apprehension and curiosity
 bharip bahujan mahasang ke prakaash ambedkar ne kaha ki The silent front is not against Dalits
 yah unki sarkaar se apni ladaai he
 There will be no anti-march march against the silent front
 daliton ko is maamle main nahin padana chahie
 Union minister Ramdas Athawale had taken an aggressive stand initially but now the RPI does not want a confrontation
 athavle or prakaash ambedkar kaa kahana he essi asti atrosity act samaapt karne kii maang sahi nahin he or na hoga
 Prakash Ambedkar has said that if Congress, NCP has a problem then they should present a proposal for amendment of the Atrocities Act in Parliament
 tippaniyan a silent front came out in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday
 sholapur main bhi badi sankhya main log march main aae
 Everywhere the local Maratha society has participated in it
 madhya july se mook morcha nikal rahaa he or abhi oktober ke aakhir tak nikalegaa
 In Pune, Washim, Buldhana, Baramati, a silent front will emerge in many cities
 sabase bada morcha satara main nikalegaa jise shivaji maharaj kii rajdhani mana jaataa he
 The slogan 'ek Maratha Lakh Maratha' has been given
 har jagah bheed kaa target whats ap ke zariye logon tak bheja ja rahaa he
 Maratha society is asking why Maratha leaders have ruled in Maharashtra for so many years, yet why their condition is bad
 mook morcha kii ek maang yah bhi he ki kheti ko lekar swaminathan cameti kii siforeeshon ke hisaab se unhen haq diya jaae
 That is, a guarantee of giving profits to the farmer by adding fifty percent of the cost
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main vaada kiya tha
 Rahul Gandhi is raising this demand in UP but is not able to hold it there, everyone is silent in Maharashtra but this demand is finding a place on the platform of social organizations
 chunki tay hua he ki sanghathan kii taraf se koi nahin bolegaa isliye koi aayojak bol hi nahin rahaa he
 The government is also surprised with whom to talk
 'prime time' main do sawaal hai
 The question of the Reservation and Atrocity Act is important but is it not a big question that the issues on which political parties should be honest are now being raised from social forums
 kya yah sanket nahin he ki raajnneetik dalon ke prati janata kaa bharosa kam hota ja rahaa he

 The tussle between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Delhi Police is nothing new
 lekin is baar gend aam aadmi party ke paale main najar aa rahi hai
 Recently, a local woman filed a police complaint against MLA Amanatullah Khan from Okhla after which the police registered an FIR in the case

 Aam Aadmi Party Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey said in the press conference, 'modi ji's police is working day and night only to register false cases against Aam Aadmi Party mlas instead of protecting the people of Delhi
 dilli police ko yah nirdesh sidhe taur par grih-mantralay or pradhanmantri karyaalay se hi die ja rahe hai
 'the woman had accused of misconduct that during the press conference, the Aam Aadmi Party showed an video of the woman complaining
 vidhayak ne aarope lagaaya ki video main shikaayat karne vaali mahila yah kehete hue suni ja sakati he ki balaatkaar kii dhamkee vaali baat police ne likhavai he
 Amanatullah Khan, MLA from Okhla, while clarifying the complaint lodged with the police, said, 'the woman got a call from me on July 10, 2016, when i was present in Meerut
 usne mujhe uske ilaake main bijli kii samasya ke bare main bataaya tha jis par maine unhe us samasya kaa jald hal nikaalane kii baat kahi thi
 After that the woman reached the police with a complaint, in which the woman accused me of talking on the phone in a threatening tone
 'mahila kaa sting video kaa hawala dete hue aam aadmi party ne dilli police par 3 aarope lagaae hai1
 The complainant woman is telling a third person that SHO had pressurized her to make false allegations against the MLA so that the police could register a case against the MLA in the relevant sections and take action

 The woman has clearly stated in this video that she had gone with a simple complaint
 lekin sach ko chhupaakar jhuthe aarope lagane ke liye police ne hi us mahila par dabaav banaaya tha
 3
 us mahila ne yah sweekaara he ki esechao ke kehane par hi wo joint kamishnar se mili thi or uske baad hi yah jhootha mukadmaa darj hua tha
 The complainant turned out to be an AAP activist, Aam Aadmi Party, says that on July 22, a CD was found at the mla's office, who did not know who kept the CD
 philhal is video sidi ke aadhaar par amanatulla unke upar lagaae gaye aarope court ke samaksh sabit karne ke liye bhi taiyaar hum
 Interestingly, the woman who complained in her first complaint has also described herself as an AAP worker for 4 years
 AAP vidhayak ke khilaaf cese darjmahila video main ye baat bhi kahati nazar ain ki vidhayak ne phone par bhaddi gaaliyaan di
 However, when the questioning woman was asked the whole case, she said that the woman seen in the video is the same
 lekin unki baat ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya he
 At present, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan has filed a complaint in the entire case to the Delhi Police, in which he has appealed to file a case against the complainant woman for making false statements against him and making false statements

 kai baar best of four ke calculation main bhi chaatr galtiyaan kar baithte hai
 Therefore, this advice from the expert will help you fill the form correctly and choose the course
 kab tak kar sakate hai form main chanjaiske alaava exparts kehete hai ki online form bharte samay jab tak aapane fees nahin bhari he tab tak aap kisi bhi galati ko sudhaar sakate hai
 But once you fill the online fee, then that form will not be edited
 aisi surat main aap nae yujaranem se phir registration kar sakate hai
 But for the first time, the filled form money will not be returned
 isliye export salaah dete hai ki fees jamaa karne se pehle apni sabhi information achche se check kar len
 This is the safe option Gurpeet Tuteja says that while filling the online form of DU, students should not look for the college option
 darasal chaatro ko sirf course chunanaa he
 After the cutoff, you can enroll in the college where you have chosen the course
 export ke mutabik, behatar hoga ki chaatr adhik se adhik corces kaa chunaav karen
 So that even if there is no cutoff of favorite course or college, they get admission in some subject and college and their year is not spoiled

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP President Mehbooba Mufti made two tweets just minutes after Home Minister Amit Shah spoke in Parliament
 donon twit unhone ek hi samay 11
 39 hrs done
 pehle twit par mufti ne kaha ki yah bhartiya loktantr kaa sabase kaala din he
 The decision of the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to go with India in 1947 proved to be wrong
 bharat sarkaar dwaara anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa faisla avaidh or asanvaidhanik he
 Today marks the darkest day in Indian democracy
 Decision of J&K leadership to reject 2 nation theory in 1947 & align with India has backfired
 Unilateral decision of GOI to scrap Article 370 is illegal & unconstitutional which will make India an occupational force in J&K
 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)august 5, 2019duusare twit main mahabuuba mufti ne likhaa ki bharat sarkaar ke is faisle se puure upmahadweep par bure nattejey saamne aaenge
 The policy of the Government of India has become clear
 bharat sarkaar jammu-kashmir or uske logon ko daraana chaahati thi
 The government has retracted from its promise about Kashmir
 tisare twit main mahabuuba ne kaha ki loktantr ke mandir ko dhokhaa diya gaya he
 Those who were trying to find a solution to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir through the United Nations have been tricked
 kashmiriyon ko alian bana diya gaya he
 It will have catastrophic consequences for the subcontinent
 gois intentions are clear
 They want the territory of J&K by terrorizing it's people
 India has failed Kashmir in keeping its promises
 - Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) August 5, 2019 People like us who placed faith in Parliament, the temple of democracy has been deceived
 Those elements in J&K who rejected the 🇮🇳 constitution & sought resolution under the UN have been vindicated
 This will exacerbate the alienation Kashmiris feel
 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)august 5, 2019main ab bhi najarband hum
 i am not allowed to meet anyone
 mujhe nahin pataa ki main or kitni der tak kisi or se baat kar paaungi
 The intentions of the Indian government are not noble
 ye iklaute muslim bahulya rajya kii ruparekha badalanaa chaahate hai
 They want Muslims to remain second class citizens in their own state
 Already under house arrest & not allowed to have visitors either
 Not sure how long I'll be able to communicate
 Is this the India we acceded to?— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)august 5, 2019gois intention is clear & sinister
 They want to change demography of the only muslim majority state in India, disempower Muslims to the extent where they become second class citizens in their own state
 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)august 5, 2019the way some sections of media & civil society are celebrating these developments with glee is disgusting & disconcerting
 - Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) August 5, 2019 Significantly, security was increased in Kashmir since late Sunday night

 Mehbooba Mufti tweeted that how ironic that public representatives like us have been arrested for fighting for peace
 duniya dekh rahi he ki jammu-kashmir main kaise logon kii aawaaj ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 What did J&K get for acceding to India? Another partition along communal lines? Our special status is not a gift bestowed upon us
 Its a right guaranteed by the same 🇮🇳 parliament

 In the bride's family, Mrs
 Kamla Arora (sushma Seth), who is the grandmother of the Arora family, is the only property owner of the entire property and treats everyone like a servant even if she has three sons Bipin (pankaj Kapoor), Vipul and Vinay
 Why not? vahiin duusare gharaane ke maalik sindhi bijnesaman mistar harry fundwani (sanjay kapur) hai jo duulhe ke bhai hai or unka puraa khandaan sone ke kapadon se jadaa hota he
 Bipin's daughter Isha (sana Kapoor) is going to be married to Harry's brother Robin
 is bichashandarweding ko organij kar rahe jagajinder joginder (shahid kapur) kii mulaakaat bipin kii beti aalia (aalia bhatta) se hoti he, donon ko raat main naa so paane kii beemaari yani insomnia he
 Bipin wholeheartedly hates Jagjinder as he does not consider Jagjinder fit for his daughter Alia
 ab is shandaar shaadi ke dauraan kai ghatnaayen ghatati hai or film ko anjaam miltaa he, kya bipin apni beti aalia or jagajinder ke ishk ko hari jhandi dikhaate hai yaa manaa kar dete hai? ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The script of the film, based on the script Destination Wedding, has been penned together by Anvita Dutt, Chaitali Parmar and Vikas Bahl, but the story never seems to falter, some forced sequences that are burdened during the film
 'queen' jaisi outstnding kahani ke baad vikaas bahal kii yah film kamjor lagati he
 Great locations, excellent actors and amazing shooting, but the story is anything that seems boring after a while
 abhinay'haidar' kii safalataa ke baad ek baar phir se chulbule avatar menshahid kapuurnajar aate hai lekin is baar unhone apane kirdaar par alag tarah kaa kaam kiya he jo aapako aakarshith karata he vahiin aalia bhatta ne apni umr ke mutabik sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Pankaj Kapoor has always been the best and acting on screen for the first time, Sasna Kapoor has also done a commendable job
 shahid or aalia kii jodi parde par kaaphi aakarshak dikhaai padati he or donon ne apana shat pratishat prayaas kiya he
 The music of the music film has been made quite different by Amit Trivedi, often the songs are shot at night which Vikas has included in the whole film with a lot of thought
 kamjor kadifilm kii script hi isaki sabase kamjor kadi he
 During 'queen', Vikas made a very good film in a low budget, which was adopted by the audience, but this time despite the big budget, that thing could not be revealed which Vikas showed in 'queen' and compared to his previous film It is bound to happen
 acchhee acting he, vijuel treet he lekin kahani ne asal main raita failaa diya he
 Why see if you are the biggest fan of Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor then definitely watch this film and if you are crazy about Vikas Bahl's 'queen' then this film can disappoint you

 The government is bringing a reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha for promotion, but the problem is how to pass the bill? The BJP is ready to disrupt the Parliament, demanding the cancellation of coal allocation
 aarakshan kaa laabh obisi ko naa milane se samaajawaadee party bhi khafa he
 Surrounded by allegations in the coal scam, the government gave the go-ahead to the bill to grant reservation in promotion to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in government jobs, but it has become a big problem for the government to pass it in Parliament
 sarkaar buudhvaar ko ye bill rajyasabha main laaegi
 The BJP has made it clear that it will not back down from its stand on obstructing Parliament on the coal scam merely to pass the bill
 yani kol block radd karne kii maang puri naa hone tak wo sansad nahin chalane degi
 The BSP supremo Mayawati had requested Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley to help pass the bill, the BJP has turned it down
 is mudde par samaajawaadee party bhi congress ke saath nahin he
 The SP may also create a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha on the issue of not including obcs in the reservation
 chunki ye samvidhan sanshodhan bill he isliye ise paas karaane ke liye sarkaar ko do tihaai bahumat kii jarurat hogi
 But, these two-thirds majority should also be the majority of the total members of Parliament
 udhar, bill ko lekar uttar pradesh main sarkari karmchaaree do faad ho gaye hai
 An organization of eighteen lakh government employees is scheduled to protest against the bill on Wednesday at all district headquarters, including Lucknow, while there are about seven lakh employees in favor of the bill who are ready to work against them

 aakhir ye paheli kya he? maranevaali hindu he yaa musalmaan?lekin ladki kii pahchaan kiye bagaiyr maamle kii tafteesh ek kadam bhi aage nahin bad sakati
 So, the police decide to send the corpse for postmortem for the moment after inspecting the opportunity and taking some pictures of the corpse
 mauka e vaardaat par laash kaa muyna karne ke baad itnaa to saafe ho gaya tha ki is ladki kaa qatl kahin or kiya gaya he or baad main laash yahaan laakar phenki gai he
 But to carry forward the investigation, it was necessary to identify the person who died first
 kyonki bagaiyr iske kaatilon tak pahunchnaa naammumkin tha
 The Kalkaji police station is in a good mood regarding this abandoned corpse
 esechao vijender ilaake ke beet ofisar se lekar apane tamaam dhakad investigators kii meeting lete hai or is dauraan sara jor ladki kii pahchaan pataa karne par hi hota he
 The police also decide to inquire about a missing girl in the surrounding area
 police laash kii kuch tasveeron ke saath aas-paas ke ilaake main ladki ko dhundhane kii koshish karti he, lekin kuch khaas faaydaa nahin hota
 Defeated, the police wait for a clue that can identify the girl
 lekin apane computer par zipanet khol kar tamaam gumshuda logon kii fehrist khangaal rahe esechao vijender kii ankhe tab chamak uthati hai, jab unki nazar abhi-abhi aplod hui ek ladki kii tasviir par padati he
 The appearance of this picture is not only meeting the person who died, but in the neck of the picture is such a locket, as it is also in the neck of the corpse
 or is ladki kii detail par nazar daalate hi ye baat takreeban saafe ho jaati he ki haa, ye ishtehaar ilaake main baraamad laash se hi taalluk rakhata he
 Because in Rohini's KN Katju Marg police station, the person who has reported the missing girl's name is Javed and a girl whose body was recovered from Ittefaq has a tattoo of Javed's name on one arm
 udhar, dilli police kii krime branch bhi is maamle kii tafteesh main jutati he or phir police jald hi rohinee main rahanevaale javed naam ke us shaks tak ja pahunchati he, jisane apni patni kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai he
 The police take him to identify a corpse resembling his wife's ring in Kalkaji and take him to the identification of the corpse and he cannot control himself after seeing the corpse
 saafe he ki laash uski patni kii hi he, jo beeti raat se hi gaayab he
 Javed's wife Payal disappeared in the night and found her dead body in the morning
 yani gumshudagi ke mahaz kuch ghanton ke andar hi uskaa katl kar diya gaya tha
 But what happened suddenly at night
 kisne use maaraa
 And the biggest question is why killed? Now the police inquires Javed about the disappearance and death of his wife Payal
 auto chalaanevaala javed bataata he ki 23 april ko wo apni bivi paayal ko raat takreeban paune das baje apni auto main difence colony golchakkar ke paas drop kar waapas laut aayaa tha or iske kuch der baad uski bivi ne use phone kar do gumnaam logon ke saath kisi thikaane ke liye ravaanaa hone kii baat kahi thi
 Also, the taxi number 9551 was also mentioned
 lekin hairaani kii baat ye thi ki javed ko naa to un gumnaam logon ke bare main hi kuch pataa tha, jinke saath paayal gai thi or naa hi wo us thikaane ke bare main kuch jaanata tha, donon paayal ko jahaan lekar gaye the
 It was clear that both Javed and Payal were in the business of Jismafaroshi
 krime branch ke daftar main police khaasi uljhan main thi
 She had come to know of the death and the last time she and her husband met
 lekin iske aage sabakuch raat ke andhere kii tarah kaala tha
 Just if there was any clue, the only number of taxis that Payal last rode was 9551, and Payal himself telephoned that night to her husband Javed
 ab chunki police ke paas doosraa koi chaara nahin tha, usne 9551 number kii texiyon ko khangaalane kii faisalaa kiya
 Police exercises started and details of about 150 such taxis, numbering 9551, were tested one after the other
 ye number dilli ke alaava upi, haryana, punjab or rajasthan jaise kai rajyo ke the, lekin is koshish main sabase badi mushkil ye thi akhir itane 9551 main se gunahagaar taxi kii pahchaan kaise kii jaae
 And then the police got such a clue that his eyes shone
 chunki police ko itnaa to pataa tha ki 9551 number kii gaadi kaa registration privet nahin, commercial he
 The police were constantly in touch with travel agencies and it was during this investigation that they came to know that a travel agency of Nehru Place runs a taxi called PB 01 9551, owned by Pradeep Singh Ropar
 pradeep dilli main apni taxi ke saath gaayab tha
 So the police decided to approach Ropar
 lekin vahaan bhi use niraashaa haath lagi
 Pradeep was not found in Ropar
 pradeep jis tarah faraar chal rahaa tha, usase ye baat takreeban saafe ho chali thi ki is vaardaat ke peeche usee kaa haath he
 Now the police detected Pradeep's mobile number and started his surveillance
 jald hi police ko is koshish main kamyaabi haath lagi or police ne motibagh ke thikaane se pradeep or uske ek saathi sikandar ko daboch liya
 That Indigo taxi number PB01 9551 was also found on the spot
 lekin ab bhi paayal ke qatl kii asli vajah or tareeke par pardaa padaa tha
 As soon as the secret of taxi number 9551 was opened, the murderer was now under police custody
 lekin qatl ke raaj par ab bhi pardaa padaa tha
 The question was, what was the hostility of Payal after the two taxi drivers? Now the police was waiting for them to open their mouths
 or aakhirkaar unhone munh khol hi diya
 Now the puzzle of the corpse found near Nehru Place was almost solved
 bas police ko qatl vaali raat kii kadiyaan jodani baaki thi or ye kaam pradeep or sikandar ke munh kholane par hi mumkin tha
 In a little questioning, both of them not only accepted the killing of Payal, but also told what happened that night
 23 april kii raat paayal dephence colony golchakkar ke paas khadi kisi customer kaa intazaar kar rahi thi or tabhi pibi 01 9551 number kii taxi par pradeep or sikandar vahaan pahunche
 a little bargaining ensued and Payal then left for an anonymous hideout with them
 isi dauraan paayal ne apane mobile se apane pati javed ko phone kiya or 9551 number kii taxi se kisi thikaane par ravaanaa hone kii baat bhi bataa di
 Payal was now in the Lodi Institution area along with his two customers Pradeep and Alexander
 jahaan unhone aapas main jismani taalluqaat bhi banaae lekin jab donon ke paayal ke saath kuch zyaada hi hinsak tareeke se pesh aana shuru kar diya, to paayal ne iskaa virodh kiya or to or paayal ne donon ko benakaab karne kii dhamkee bhi di or bas isi baat se kafa do doston ne mil kar maukey par hi paayal ko hameshaa hameshaa ke liye maut kii neend sula diya
 Now Payal was dead
 lekin uski laash ko thikaane lagaana donon ke liye ek badi chunauti thi
 Therefore, both of them decided to locate him on their own
 raat ke andhere main laash car main rakh kar donon kisi sunsaan thikaane ke liye nikle
 Then both of them reached towards Nehru Place and went ahead by throwing Payal's corpse near the pillar number 127 of the metro
 donon shaayad kabhi pakade bhi naa jate agar paayal ne apane pati ko phone par 9551 number kii taxi par savaar hone kii baat na bataai hoti
