 In fact, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Vijender Gupta, had given notice of breach of privilege for lying in the House over the report on the Deputy Chief Minister, which was turned down by the Speaker
 lekin dilachasp baat ye rahi ki iske baad jab upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya bolne ke liye khadey hue, to unhone ulte vijendra gupta par hi report li karne kaa aarope jad diya
 Manish Sisodia said that he had received the CAG report on August 24 at 5:30 pm, but before that the Leader of the Opposition issued a press release and provided the facts of the report to the media
 sisodiya ne kaha ki sieji kii report kanuunan pehle sadan main pesh honi chahie, lekin iske pehle hi report media ke paas kaise pahunchi, isaki jaanch kii jaani chahie
 He also demanded to send the matter to the Privileges Committee for leaking a report on the Leader of the Opposition, which was accepted by the Speaker

 Also, the amount of 526 crores which the Opposition used to talk about, has also proved to be wrong because according to the leaked report, Delhi Government has spent only 101 crores on advertisements, including 20 crores of last year

 Demonetisation has now become the biggest issue in Uttar Pradesh elections
 vipakshi partiyaan isko lekar modi or bijepi ko gherne main lagi hai
 On Friday, when Mayawati was asked about Modi's statement, she said that Modi is actually running his mind not on the poor but on how to benefit the wealthiest
 bijepi or modi notebandi cokaladhanase jodakar logon kaa samarthan jutaney main lagi he or logon se apil kar rahi he ki kuch din kii takalif desh ke khatir vah bardaasht kar len
 At the same time, the Samajwadi Party Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party are engaged in encircling the BJP due to the problems of demonetisation
 mayawati ne shuukravaar ko apni press conference main daawa kiya ki note bandi kii vajah se ho rahi dikkaton se ab tak 100 logon kii jaan ja chuki he, lekin kisi ko bhi centre sarkaar ne koi madad nahin pahunchaai
 Mayawati was asked about Modi's statement in which he has said that he is a fakir
 mayawati ne is sawaal par naaraaz hote hue kaha ki darasal modi fakir nahin, balki bahut bade maldaar aadmi hai
 They said that she is calling Modi a good man because who is the guardian of Dhanseth and the capitalists, what else can be called that
 bijepi notebandi ko bhrashtachar se jodakar logon kaa dil jeetne kii koshish kar rahi he
 However, Mayawati raised the question that if the central government is really so serious about curbing corruption then why the Lokpal was not appointed till date
 modi par hamalaa bolte hue unhone yah bhi kaha kimodijab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the tab vahaan bhi unhone lokayukta ko pangu bana kar rakhaa tha
 Home Minister Amit Shah's statement on Jammu and Kashmir has once again brought Section-370 into the limelight
 shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan amit shah ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir main dhara-370 sthaayee nahin balki asthaayee he

 piemo main rajyamantri jitendra singh ne kaha ki pandit nehru bhi maanate the ki dhara-370 or dhara 35-A samvidhan kii asthaayee vyavasthaaen hai
 Jitendra Singh, Lok Sabha MP from Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir, said that special state status to Jammu and Kashmir is an excuse created by the Congress and the National Conference
 jab ye unhen suut karata he to special hota he anyathaa nahin
 "please indicate to the Home Minister in the Lok Sabha that on Friday, the Home Minister said in the Lok Sabha that Article 370 of the Constitution giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir is a temporary arrangement of the Constitution
 vipaksh kii shankaaon kaa jawaab dete hue amit shah ne kaha ki anuchhed main hi saaf taur par likhaa he ki ye asthaayee he
 Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said that those opposing us on this issue forget that Pandit Nehru, one of the biggest strategists of Section 370 and 35-A, was also of this ideology
 This is going to be a temporary provision of the Constitution of India and the Constituent Assembly
 jitendra singh ne aage kaha, "samvidhan sabha ke duusare sadasyon jaise shyama prasad mukherjee kii aapattiyon ko dur karne ke liye pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kaha tha, ye ghiste-ghiste ghis jaaegi
 mos PMO Dr Jitendra Singh on Article 370 or 35A: In order to pacify the reservations of other members including Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said, "ye ghiste ghiste ghis jaayegi" https: / / t

 So the different picture of the Indian subcontinent, Dr
 Jitendra Singh, MP from Udhampur, said that today the condition of Jammu and Kashmir would have been different if Pandit Nehru had allowed the number 2 in his cabinet and the then Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Petal to settle the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in the same way
 The way he settled the case of Hyderabad and other princely states
 jitendra singh ne kaha ki agar aisa hua hota to na sirf jammu-kashmir balki puure bhartiya up mahadweep kii tasviir duusari hoti

 dilli police kii krime branch ne dilli ke sabase bade car jaikar ko giraftaar kiya he
 This jacker used to target only luxury cars and had so far robbed more than 100 luxury vehicles
 is hiprophile lutere par ek nahin do nahin balki 14 hatyaon ke maamle bhi darj hai
 This marauder caught by the crime branch is not a petty marauder, but this molester is very high profile
 jo ghumta hawaii jahaaj main he, chalata lagjri gadiyon main he or pahentaa wo branded kapade hai jinke liye aam insaan tarasate hai
 There are 14 cases of murder on this high profile robber
 ye luteraa ab tak 14 maasoom logon ko maut ke ghat utaar chukaa he
 In fact, for the past few months from the parking lot of shopping malls of South Delhi, some robbers used to target luxury vehicles on the basis of gun and took away the owner of the vehicle with them
 haive par le jaakar ye maalik ko chhod gaadi apane saath lekar faraar ho jate the
 Such increasing incidents from the shopping malls of South Delhi had plagued the police and this is the reason why the Delhi Police was constantly trying to crack down on these robbers
 kuch din pehle dilli police ko yah jaankaree mili ki vijay farmana naam kaa luteraa apane saathiyon ke saath milakar dilli ke mal kii parking se is tarah kii vaardaaton ko anjaam detaa he or vijay farmana abhi lakhanu main chupa hua he
 After this, Crime Branch of Delhi Police immediately sent its team to Lucknow
 kai jagahon par chhapemari karne ke baad buudhvaar ko krime branch ne vijay farmana ko lakhanu se giraftaar kar liya
 In the interrogation of the police after the arrest, Vijay Farmana made several revelations
 usne bataaya ki vah ab tak dilli ensiaar se 100 se zyada lagjri gadiyon ko nishaanaa bana chukaa he
 Vijay's hobbies are extremely high profile
 wo apane saathiyon ke saath milakar keval lagjri gadiyon ko nishaanaa banaata tha
 Vijay Dawn is heavily influenced by the film
 vijay apane aapako don se kam nahin samajhataa tha
 Vijay also has many girlfriends and that is why Vijay used to drive his girlfriends only by targeting luxury vehicles to fulfill his hobbies
 vijay ko tatu kaa bhi bahut shauk he, usne apane puure sharir par tatu banawaye hue hai
 However, after Vijay's arrest, the Crime Branch claims to have settled 14 cases
 philhal vijay se lagaataar poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Now the police are looking for Vijay's associates who along with Vijay used to target luxury vehicles
 dilli police ne kidney choron ke ek aise international racket kaa pardaafaash kiya he, jo desh ke nami apollo aspataal main fal-phool rahaa tha
 The strings of this racket spread to different states of the country as well as foreigners coming to India for treatment
 dhandhebaaz auni-pauni qeemat par kidney karidate or phir unhen moti rakam par biimaar logon ko bech dete the
 Now the police suspect that many big people and doctors may also be involved in this racket
 videshon tak failaa he networkajee haa, vahapolo aspataalajahan aksar jaani maani hastiyaan apana ilaaj karaane ke liye pahunchati hai
 The hospital which is considered to be equipped with all facilities
 lekin kya aap yakeen karenge ki thik sarita vihaar thane or south east zile ke disipi offis ke saamne maujuud is aspataal main chah maheenon se ek bada kidney racket kaam kar rahaa tha? ek aisa kidney racket jiske taar sirf desh hi nahin, balki videshon tak bhi faile hue the
 And who has made crores of rupees, and not millions in business, till now? Apollo Hospitals, the base of kidney racket, looks strange, but now what the Delhi Police has revealed, it is clear that yes, these racketeers Had made this hospital its base
 dilli police ko tab pehali baar is racket kaa pataa chalaa jab ek danpati aapasi jhagade kii shikaayat lekar aspataal ke saamne maujuud sarita vihaar thane main pahunchi
 Actually, both were pawns of Kidneybant's business and both had a fight over the amount of horse-trading
 aise hua racket kaa khulaasaajab police ne donon kaa jhagada sulajhane kii koshish kii,kidney racketki nai kahani saamne aa gai
 After this, the police arrested five businessmen of this racket one by one
 aseem sikadar, satya prakaash urf aashu, devashish mallik, aditya or shailesh saxena
 However, according to the police, a man named Rajkumar Rao, the mastermind of this racket, is still absconding
 or ab police is racket ke baaki dhandhebaazon kaa peechha karti hui kolkata, chennai or coimbatore jaisi kai jagahon par chhapemari kar rahi he
 This is how this kidney racket works
 In this racket, the work of every businessman was divided
 kuch log shikaar yani donor kii talash karte the, jabaki kuch resiver kii
 Fake papers were then made to show the victim and donor relatives
 aspataal ke mulaazim is kaam main unki madad karte the
 The donor and receiver were then hospitalized
 or 10-15 dinon main deal puri ho jaati thi
 The amount of money in the racket is a shocking thing in itself
 ye racket kidani ke liye zaruuratmand se 20 se 25 lakh vasuulata tha
 In this, middlemen used to get 1-1 lakh rupees
 jabaki donor ko sirf 3 se 4 lakh
 This is why businessmen seek donors and receivers from place to place, get fake papers prepared and then recover lakhs of rupees
 khaas baat ye he ki videshi zaruuratmand ko kidney bechney ke liye hindustani ke mukaable kai guna zyaada rakam milti he
 Big doctors are also involved! In this case the question is, where did the rest of the fat money go? or yahi vajah he ki ab police ko lag rahaa he ki abhi is maamle main kai or khulaase ho sakate hai
 It is possible that a doctor or a big man is also involved in the business
 dilli police ke joint seepi arapy upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki police abhi jaanch main kisi ko clin chit nahin de rahi he
 If necessary, the doctors of the hospital will also be questioned
 police kii maane to is racket ke taar sirf dilli or aas-paas hi nahin balki puure desh or yahaan tak ki videshon main bhi faile hue hai
 Where do millions of rupees go? The monkey money of the money in the kidney racket flourishing in the country's famous Apollo hospital has confused the police
 darasal, ab tak kii chaanbin main ye baat to saafe he ki ek kidney kii kharid-farokht kul 20 se 25 lakh rupye main hoti he
 But a huge amount of this purchase and sale used to disappear mysteriously
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki is rakam kaa chota hissaa donor or midileman ko miltaa tha
 While the largest portion of the huge amount to be recovered from the receiver goes to the end, at the moment no one knows
 or bas isi sawaal ne police ko is dhandhe kii badi machhliyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 This is the reason that now the police has also handed over a long list of questions to the Apollo Hospital Management
 haalanki aspataal prabandhan is maamle par camere par to kuch nahin bolnaa chahta
 But he has given his statement
 apollo aspataal kaa bayaanis puure maamle main apollo aspataal ne ek adhikarik bayaan jari karte hue kaha "police ne hamase ek din pehle ek kidney racket ko lekar mulaakaat kii
 We cooperated with the police
 or police ne jo jaankaree hamase maangi wo hamane unhen muhaiyaa karai
 Whatever kidney transplant we have here is done with all the necessary documents
 ham kanoonee prakiya ke tahat kaam karte hai, hame is ghatana kii jaankaree nahin thi
 The two pss caught are not Apollo's staff, but the doctors' pss
 ham dilli police se is maamle main kadi karrwai chaahate hai
 "in fact, out of the five people arrested so far in this connection, there are two who work as PS of doctors in Apollo
 or inhen ke zarie ab tak apollo main kidney churaane or use aage bechney kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 And this was when very stringent government laws exist regarding organ donation
 pichley saal bhi bechi gayi thi kai kidneepuchhatacha main is racket ke aropiyon ne bataaya he ki ye coimbatore main bhi 2015 main kareeb 12 se 15 kidney nikalava chuke he
 c Rajkumar Rao is also a mastermind from Andhra who is currently absconding
 is maamle main teen mahila donor bhi he jinhone paise lekar apni kidney bechi he
 Police have so far recovered the necessary documents, fake voter eye cards, photographs, medical reports, electronic gadgets and about two lakh rupees for kidney transplant from this racket
 philhal is silsile main sirf dilli hi nahin, balki kolkata, chennai samet desh ke kai duusare shaharon main bhi chhapemari kaa silsilaa jari he
 Joint CP RP Upadhyay, who is on the police radar, says to the Delhi Police that police teams are conducting raids in many areas of Delhi besides Kolkata and Chennai
 apollo hospital kii mushkil aane vaale dinon main bad sakati he kyonki asapataal ke kuch or staff member or doctor bhi police ke radar par hai
 What does the law say, according to the Law of Human Argon Transplant Act 1994, only people with blood relations can donate their argon
 cameti kii maujuudagi or docktaron kii nigaraanee main hi transplat prakiya kii ja sakati he
 Kidney donation can only be done by parents siblings and grandparents to each other
 kidney donneton ke liye vakyaada har aspataal main ek asisment cameti maujuud hoti he

 apni party se naaraaz bhartiya janata party ke 'bhishma pitamah' laalkrishna adwani ne party ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 All the big leaders from the party are engaged in his honor, but despite all efforts, Advani's resentment has not ended
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar yah bhi ki bijepi adwani ko manaane kii koshish to kar rahi he, par iske liye narendra modi par liye gaye faisle se wo peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Now everyone has the same question in their mind, what is the reason that BJP is willing to ignore Advani for the sake of Narendra Modi
 sambhav he ki iske kai kaaran hon
 Let's examine these reasons: Whoever is popular is the same leader
 While addressing the BJP workers, when the party president Rajnath Singh said that the one who is popular is the leader
 to unka ishaara saaf tha ki ab bijepi kii naiyya ke khevaiyaa modi honge
 This is because of Modi's popularity
 gujarat kii janata ke saath desh ke yuvaaon ke bich bhi modi kii acchhee pakad he
 Modi is also a hero of the middle class because of his exceptional speech
 party kaaryakartaaon ke bich modi ko lekar jabardast utsaah he
 In such a situation, it is very difficult for the party to ignore his popularity
 aresas kii chaah ke khilaaf kaise jaae bijepi?modi kii tajposhi ke peeche aresas kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 It was only after the pressure of the Sangh that the party made Modi the election commander in a hurry at the Goa Executive
 aisa virale hi hua he jab bijepi sangh ke kisi nirdesh ke khilaaf gai ho, aise main is nirnay ko badal paanaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 Actually, BJP will need Sangh workers in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki sangh kaa sanghathan desh main modi ke liye lahar banane kaa kaam karegaa, jise party chunavi phaayde or nuksaan se jod kar dekh rahi he
 It is not about the present, but the future, the reason for Advani's separation in the party in this way is also his age
 adwani 84 saal ke hai
 In the future, there is skepticism about his activism in politics
 vahiin, party apane bhavishya kii soch rahi he
 If Modi takes over the leadership of the party, then for the next 10-15 years, the BJP will get rid of the anxiety of the leadership
 langade ghode par koun lagaae satta?2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main party ko karaari haar saamana karnaa padaa tha
 After this, Advani's popularity slowly began to decline
 maujuuda raajnneetik paridrishy main adwani ko kaman saunpane se party ko chunavi phayda hoga, ise lekar gambhir sawaal he
 
 
 
 taaki netaa ko lekar voter bhram main na rahenendie main piem ummidavaari ko lekar machi khinchataan par media main aa rahi khabaron par party viraam lagaana chaahati he
 BJP wants to make its stand clear on this issue
 taaki matadaataaon ke bich agle chunaav main party ke chehre ke lekar sthiti spasht ho
 At the same time, the allies of the coalition should be made aware of the party's stance in gestures
 party ne bhale hi modi ko chunavi commander banaaya he, yah unki piem ummidavaari kii ore ek or majboot kadam he
 In the election survey too, the role of the poll survey to some extent may have been behind the decision of Modi forward party
 lagbhag saare chunavi surveykshanon main modi bijepi ke sabase pasandida chehre banakar ubhar rahe hai
 Whether it is his claim to the post of PM or the status of the seats BJP gets after declaring him leader
 har morche par modi ke saath hi party ko phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, the party would like to go with the mood of the public

 Due to this decision of the Narendra Modi government, the existence of article-35a will also end, because there will no longer be Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
 dhara-35e anuchhed 370 kaa hi hissaa he

 jabaki somvaar ko mukhyamantrinithish kumaarane phone kar unke swasthya kii jaankaree lee, lekin media main yah khabar mangalvaar ko faili
 After the news of Nitish talking to Lalu on the phone, Lalu's younger son Tejashwi was not very happy with this
 unhone twit ke jariye tanj kasate hue kaha ki lalu yadav kaa fistula kaa oparation ravivaar ko hua tha, or yah kuch nahin balki deree se kiya gaya kartsi kol tha
 He inquires about Lalu's health, but is surprised that Nitish did not take his ill for the last four months
 aaj phone kar poocha
 Perhaps he came to know that the people of BJP and NDA are going to the hospital to inquire about his well being, so he also called
 Nothing but a late courtesy call to enquire abt his health as he underwent fistula operation on Sunday
 Surprisingly nitishji got to knw abt his ill health after 4months of hospitalisation
 i hope he realises he is last politician to enquire following BJP / NDA Ministers visiting himhttps: / / t

 Nitish was involved in the son's wedding, however, earlier on June 11, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar tweeted and greeted Lalu on his birthday and also wished him a speedy recovery

 lekin is beemaari ko kisi dal yaa netaa ne pramukhataa se pesh nahin kiya
 Prevention of the problem of encephalitis, which kills hundreds of children to death every year, is not an election issue for any party, so Dr
 RN Singh of Gorakhpur together with the people has prepared a public manifesto to end encephalitis

 Encephalitis is caused by a mosquito that grows on paddy fields in Purvanchal

 party ne ise 'satya kii jeet' qaraar dete hue kaha ki congress or uske mitra enjio ke 11 saalon ke dushprachaar ke bich adaalat ke is faisle se narendra modi or majboot banakar ubhare hai
 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley told reporters that fake statements cannot be evidence
 asaty or satya ke bich ek buniyadi fark yah hota he ki satya ke saath sabhi tathy ekasaath rahete hai, jabaki asaty bikhar jaataa he
 He said that giving a clean chit to Narendra Modi in connection with the 2002 Gujarat riots confirmed the bjp's view that the allegations were propagated and politically and there were no facts
 hamen yah kehane main koi sankoch nahin he ki congress party narendra modi ke khilaaf koi raajnneetik ladaai nahin lard sakati he, isliye is tarah ke dushprachaar karti rahi he
 Jaitley said, Modi remained unaffected by the propaganda of the Congress party and its friend ngos in the last 11 years and during this time he had a landslide victory in the state elections of 2002, 2007 and 2012
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetik or prashasnic kushalta sabit karne ke baad modi ko aaj nyaaypalik ne bhi paak-saaf qaraar dene kii pushti kii he
 This is a moral victory for BJP and Narendra Modi
 bijepi ne narendra modi ko apana pradhanmantri ummidavaar to bana diya, lekin abhi yah saaf nahin he ki ve kahaan se loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladenge
 According to sources, Modi's camp in the Sangh Parivar and BJP wants Modi to fight either Gandhinagar or Varanasi
 lekin gandhinagar se adwani maidan main utarana chaahate hai or varanasi se murali manohar joshi
 Modi's seat is stuck in the desire of the elderly
 bijepi ke nae senapati ke liye apane bujurgon se hi nipatna mushkil ho rahaa he
 According to sources, the Modi camp in the BJP and the desire of the RSS are stuck on a search for a seat that suits Modi
 isamen do siten ain- gujarat main gandhinagar or uttar pradesh main varanasi
 But in the reserved seat for Modi, both the elders of the party implicated the screw
 jaise hi modi kaa naam bijepi kii taraf se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par saamne aayaa, sangh ne gandhinagar ke alaava varanasi main bhi homework shuru kar diya
 Actually, the party wanted to shoot two with one stone from the Varanasi seat
 ek to varanasi main modi kii jeet aasaan lag rahi thi or doosraa purvanchal main apane pichde aadhaar ko modi ke pichde card se majboot karnaa chaah rahi thi
 But if sources are to be believed, Joshi is adamant that he will contest from Varanasi from where he won the last time
 jab bijepi main modi kaa sikaa chal niklaa, tabhi ye khabar bhi ai ki party adwani or murali manohar joshi ko rajyasabha main bhejnaa chaahati he
 But before there would have been any political uproar over it, even before 87-year-old Advani challenged - we will fight for the Lok Sabha
 adwani ke sakht tevar ke baad ek khabar or uchhali ki wo gandhinagar kii apni paramparaagat seat chhodkar madhya pradesh main bhopal yaa indore se chunaav lard sakate hai
 But now the Modi camp does not want Advani to leave Gandhinagar
 adwani se to modi ke rishton main khatas piem kii ummidavaari ke samay hi aa chuki thi
 Somehow the ceasefire happened, but now the question of seat has started colliding with each other

 iske baad modi nepal ke sansad ko sambodhit karenge
 Earlier, Modi, who arrived in Nepal today on a two-day visit, was welcomed
 nepal ke pradhanmantri susheel koirala ne kathmandu ke tribhuvan airport par modi kii aguwai kii
 Members of the Nepalese Cabinet and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court were present during this period
 hawaii adde par nepal ke up pradhanmantri balm dev gautam or prakaash maan singh bhi maujuud the
 Modi was given a 19-gun salute
 modi ko hawaii adde par hi rangarang samaaroh main guard of honor diya gaya or is maukey par bharat or nepal ke raashtragan bajaae gaye
 Jeet Bahadur has also gone to Nepal along with PM Modi
 modi ne'dharmaputra' jeet bahadurko nepal main uske mata-pita se milwaaya
 (photo: Narendra Modi meeting Jeet Bahadur's family) During the 10-minute journey from the airport to the hotel, a large number of people were seen on the streets
 ye log jhande laharaa rahe the or apane camaron evam mobile phone se tasviren le rahe the
 Strong security arrangements have also been made in Nepal in view of Modi's visit
 17 saal baad ye pehla mauka he jab bharat ke pradhanmantri nepal ke daure par gaye hai
 (photo: Crowds gathered to see Narendra Modi in Kathmandu) (photo: Modi's reception at Tribhuvan Airport in Kathmandu) The security beach at chape-chape in Kathmandu has turned into a cantonment
 espiji ke commando kathmandu pahunch gaye hai jabaki nepali fouj chappe-chappe par tainaat he
 The Nepal government has also announced a two-day holiday in Kathmandu
 aasmaan main nepali airforce ke helicopteron kaa bedaa sabase bade or sabase kade suraksha mishan par lagaataar udaan bhar rahe hai
 There will be a four-level impenetrable enclosure around Modi from the plane landing on August 3 to the return flight
 modi ke sabase kareeb dilli se gai espiji kii tagdi team hogi, kareeb 20 commando vaala ye group apane puure sazosaman ke saath pehle hi kathmandu kooch kar chukaa he
 Read, to solve the complicated knot of politics and relations, Nepali Army's Jambaz Commandos have been deployed on the second level of Modi's security during the visit to Nepal
 sabase aadhunik hathiyaaron se las kareeb sau se zyada commando apni himmat or hamale ko lekar duniya bhar main mashhoor hai
 The third circle of Modi's security will be handed over to Nepal's Anti Terrorist Police

 The fourth command under Modi's security cordon will be handled by the Nepali Police, responsible for the vigorous monitoring of the areas from where Modi's convoy will pass
 MCD chunaav main bijepi ko jahaan ek taraf prachand bahumat mila he, to duusari ore congress or aam aadmi party ko vipaksh main baithne ko majaboor hona padaa he
 In this too, in the three mcds, the Aam Aadmi Party will play an important role in the opposition, while the challenge before the Congress will be to find a face that can keep the Congress councilors ranked third in the MCD elections for the next five years
 congress beete 10 saal seemsidimen vipaksh main rahi he
 The Congress has won the maximum 15 councilors in the North MCD, 12 in the South and the lowest 3 in the East
 north emsidi main jisko congress kaa sabase vishwasaneey cheharaa mana ja rahaa he vah malakaganj se lagaataar duusari baar jeet kar pahunchi guddi devi
 It is believed that in Gudi wave, Guddi Devi has attracted the attention of the high command by saving her seat
 malakaganj seat par dalit or madhyam vargeey voter hone ke kaaran congress or aam aadmi party ke saath-saath bahujan samaaj party ke bich trikoniya muqabla tha, lekin beete paanch saal main mahila suraksha ho yaa phir sharaab ke theke band karwaanaa, ward main pani kii killat ko lekar pradarshan hon yaa phir jaccha-baccha centre banvaanaa
 
 
 These acts of Guddi Devi made her deep penetration among the voters and she managed to save her fort
 guddi devi us vakt charchaa main ain, jab unhone pension ko fund na milane par sadan main sattapaksh ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai or vidhwaaon or bujurgon ko pension dilwaai
 It is believed that in view of Guddi Devi's constant fight over issues related to Dalits, the Congress can bet on them
 haalanki anand parvat se jeet kar ain prerana or bazaar sita ram se seemaa tahiraa bhi is daud main hai, kyonki inke paas bhi emsidi main pichley 5 saal kaa anubhav he
 Abhishek Dutt may be the Congress' first choice in southmcd
 dutt ne duusari baar jeet hasil kii he or emsidi se jude muddon par acchhee pakad rakhte hai
 Therefore, given his experience, the Congress can play bets on him
 east emsidi main congress kii taraf se netaa vipaksh rah chuki varyam cor ke is chunaav main haarane ke kaaran congress kisi nae chehre ko saamne laa sakati he
 On the other hand, there are almost all new faces in the Aam Aadmi Party, but this is the second innings of AAP councilor Rakesh Kumar from Ajmeri Gate in North MCD
 rakesh us vakt charchaa main aae the, jab ramlila maidan main teenon emsidi ke sanyukt sadan ke dauraan unako chaanta maaraa gaya tha
 After that politics was hot and all the big leaders of AAP condemned it and demanded to register an FIR against the culprits
 rakesh ke anubhav ko dekhte hue aap unako netaa vipaksh bana sakati he
 At the same time, due to almost all the new councilors in South and East, only a new face is likely to sit in the post of Leader of the Opposition
 pathankot aatanki hamale mempakistan kaa hathhone kaa sabase bada saboot mila he
 The team investigating the case has found food packets labeled Pakistan in Symbal near the international border
 pakistani food packet milane par unhenenie ke havalekar diya gaya he, jo ab jaanch ke liye forencik lab (CFSL) bheje gaye hai
 It is being told that 'made in Karachi' was written on the food packet
 inamen shahi paneer, chiken, daal frai or lahori chhole samet kai tarah kaa khaane kaa saamaan tha
 Apart from this, 40 milk packets have also been recovered, whose manufacturing date was 16 November 2015 and the expiry date was 8 February 2016

 BSF is continuously investigating the border of Pathankot and Jammu
 jeepies divaais, mobile phone or anya saamaan kii talash kar kii ja rahi he, ashanka jataai gai he ki aatankiyon ne saboot mitaane ke liye ho saktaa he aisi chizon ko kahin chupaaya ho
 According to evidence sources not found against SP Salvinder Singh, no evidence has been found against SP Salvinder Singh who was abducted before the terror attack
 laai detector test main bhi kuch bhi sandigdh nahin niklaa
 Along with this, another disappointment for the NIA was that the targets of shoes found near Bamiyal village did not match the terrorists

 The terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, once again brought back painful memories of the terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase of January 2016
 aatanki is hamale kii firaaq main pehle se hi the

 rauf jaish kii intelligence wing kaa pramukh bhi he
 In the video, Rauf is seen during the Tahrir at Ekamsjid in Bahawalpur, Pakistan
 isamen wo pathankot se bhi bade hamale karne kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Rauf, who has carried out many terrorist attacks in India, is surrounded by terrorists and where Jash fighters are being prepared against India
 "pathankot se badi karwayee karne wale hain
 Jaish walon, likh ke rakh lo, aisi karwagee karne wale hain ki Pathankot bhi yaad rahega, Nagrota bhi yaad rahega "rauf Asghar, operational head of Jaish & brother of Masood Azhar in Pakistan's Bahawalpur # Pulwama # CRPF # Lethporapic

 This video is also opening the layers of Pakistan's falsehood, in which Pakistan has been talking about not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts
 ye pehla mauka he jab is aatanki sargana ko camere main kaid kiya gaya he
 It is being told that this video has been recorded in the third week of December

 Sanjay Singh has demanded that the police in Delhi is with the Union Home Ministry, so they should call a meeting to curb these matters

 But no action is being taken
 aapako bataa den ki beete do dinon main rajdhani main kul 9 hatyaein ho gai hai
 War on Twitter was also sparked by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Delhi Police on the same issue
 bihar kii rajdhani patna main baadh ke baad bijepi or jediu main hi aapasi takaraav badhata ja rahaa he
 While bjp's Union Minister Giriraj Singh was holding the front, till now JDU kept silence but now it seems that Sanjay Kumar Jha has taken the front
 kuch din pehle giriraaj singh ne twitor par kaha tha, 'aaj se durgapuja kaa mela shuru ho gaya he
 
 
 On behalf of the Bihar NDA, i apologize to those Sanatanis where the worship, pandal and fair have not been held due to the floods

 Although Sanjay Kumar Jha did not take any name in this tweet, but from his style of writing, it is clear on whose side
 aisa lag rahaa he ki jediu ke netaa bhi ab giriraaj singh ko unheen kii bhashaa main jawaab main dene kaa faisla kar liya he
 Sanjay Jha had earlier also targeted Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki patna ke jalajmav par unhone kendriya jalashakti mantri se baat kar farakka bairaj ke 119 get khulavaa die hai
 To this, Sanjay Jha replied that he has opened by talking to the Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 lekin 109ke baad 110waan get kab bana yah maaloom nahin he
 In political circles, it is believed that when leaders like Sanjay Jha, who work as a troubleshooter on every issue between Janata Dal United and BJP, and if they too jump into a rhetoric, then the water has gone above the head

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has taken a major decision on the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 viechpi ne ram mandir nirmaan abhiyaan ko chaar maheene tak ke liye roak diya he
 The VHP has decided not to run any campaign on the Ram Mandir issue till the end of Lok Sabha elections 2019, as it does not want the Ram Mandir case to become an election issue
 jabaki kumbh main dharmasabha kii baithak main sadhu-santon ne prastaav paas kar kaha tha ki ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan tak wo chaiyn se nahin baithenge
 Talking to Aaj Tak, International Joint General Secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Surendra Jain said that the VHP has decided that the ongoing campaign for construction of Ayodhya Ram temple will not be carried out till the Lok Sabha elections
 ham nahin chaahate hai ki yah koi chunavi mudda bane, kyonki ram mandir liye aasthaa or pavitrataa se judaa hua he
 Surendra Jain said that we are often accused of campaigning to build a Ram temple for the political benefit of a particular party
 aise main ham isen kisi raajnneetik dal-dal main is mudde ko nahin fansaana chaahate hai
 This is a sacred issue, we want to keep it beyond politics
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jab bhi koi andolan hota he, use raajnneeti se joda jaataa he
 That is why we have decided that we will not run any movement for four months
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir andolan ko rokane kii duusari badi vajah ye he ki chunaav ghoshnaa ke saath hi desh main aachaar samhita lagu ho jaati he
 In such a situation unnecessary conflicts and disputes are created
 isiilie loktantr ke is parv kaa sammaan kaa faisla karte hue viechpi ne nirnay kiya he ki ham kisi tarah ke vivaad main na pade or aachaar samhita ke ullaghann main baadha na bane
 In view of this, we have decided to stop the Ram temple campaign for four months
 bataa den ki ayodhya main ram mandir-babari masjid vivaad se judaa cese adaalat main 1950 main chal rahaa he

 After this, both the parties challenged the High Court's decision in the Supreme Court, since then the matter is in the country's largest court
