 At a press conference in the afternoon, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay demanded Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's resignation
 satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne kaledhan kaa samarthan kiya he, jabaki log kaledhan ke virodh main notebandi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai

 The news of women being tortured and killed for dowry continues to be read day by day, but this time the dowry-in-laws in Jaipur did something to their daughter-in-law, who probably will not forget her all her life
 28-varshiya ladki ke mata-pita ne police main dahej pratadna kaa cese darj karavaate hue bataaya ki sasuraal waalon ne kathith rup se pehle to unki beti ko buree tarah maaraa-peeta, or jab vah behosh ho gai, uske sharir par saat jagah godana (tatu - tattoo) karvaa diya, or gaaliyaan likhva deen
 The tattoo on his daughter's forehead was inscribed, 'my father is a thief', as his parents were unable to give Rs 51,000 as dowry in his marriage held last year
 yaheen nahin, sasuraal waalon ne unki beti ke sharir ke chah anya hisson main bhi gaaliyon ko godane ke rup main (tatu - tattoo) likhva diya

 As soon as the water arrives on Wednesday, make arrangements for the next two days immediately, as the supply of water will be affected in many areas of South Delhi from Thursday to Friday morning

 The reason for this is that to overcome the water shortage, the new pipeline laid will be connected to the main line of South Delhi

 The Congress is furious over these allegations of Amit Shah and now the party has retaliated
 purv kendriya mantri or congress saansad shashi tharur ne amit shah par tanj ksaa or kaha ki shaayad, amit shah kaa dhyaan itihaas kii class main nahin tha, isliye wo aisi baaten kar rahe hai
 Talking to India Today TV on the issue, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, '


 i don't think he (amit Shah) was paying attention in the history class
 agar aap desh ke itihaas ko dekhen to tab sirf do hi partiyaan thim jo ki tu-nesan theory kaa samarthan kar rahi thim
 The first was the Hindu Mahasabha and the second Muslim League, these two parties were describing hindu-muslim as two separate nations'

 com / ac1xpn6qbi— India Today (@indiatoday) December 10, 2019 The Congress MP said that every leader other than him then denied this
 congress ne bhi tab kaha tha ki bharat sabhi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Shashi Tharoor said that the Congress had also opposed that the Muslim League is the voice of the Muslims of the country
 desh kii aazaadee ke baad bhi yahi kaayam he, desh main musalmaan hameshaa yahaan surakshit hai
 Shashi Tharoor said that with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, this price is also seen to be ending today
 isse pehle shashi tharur loksabhaa main bhi is bill ke virodh main bol chuke hai, unhone is bill kaa virodh karte hue ise samvidhan ke khilaaf bataaya
 Significantly, in the Lok Sabha, when Union Home Minister Amit Shah was replying to the discussion on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, he made a sharp attack on the Congress
 amit shah ne sadan main kaha tha ki congress party agar dharm ke aadhaar par desh kaa bantwaaraa nahin karti, to aaj naagarikta sanshodhan bill ko laane kii jarurat nahin padati
 The Congress created a lot of uproar in the Lok Sabha on Amit Shah's statement
 rajya main trinmul congress ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar kaa phayda uthaane kaa mauka congress nahin chuknaa chaahati
 Therefore, it is willing to forget all its previous differences and partner with the Left parties so that the anti-tmc and anti-bjp parties do not get a single vote
 yahaan tak ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apane kaaryakartaaon kii ichchhaaon ke khilaaf jate hue congress kii do paaramparik siton se apana daawa bhi chhod diya he
 The CPM has also confirmed this in its Central Committee meeting, citing alliances with Congress as correct
 4 march ko jari uske ek likhit bayaan main kaha gaya, ''yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki pashchim bengal main trinmul virdohi or bhaajapa virdohi vot nahin banten, central cameti upyukt ranneeti apnayegi
 The Central Committee has decided that there will be no contest between the four seats occupied by the Congress and the two occupied by the Left
 ''in chah siton main se do—raiganj or murshidaabad—ko lekar donon dalon ke bich khinchataan thi
 Both the seats are considered to be the old stronghold of the Congress and if we consider the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as an exception, then the Congress has always won from here
 congress ne in siton par apana daawa thok diya kyonki 2014 main raiganj main vah sirf 1,600 voton ke antar se haari thi or murshidaabad congress ke saansad adheer choudhary kaa garh he
 The CPM won the Murshidabad seat by 18,000 votes, while the current MP of the party in Raiganj, Mohammad Salim, was not ready to leave his constituency
 bengal congress ke netaaon ke virodh ke baavjood, rahul gandhi ne raiganj or murshidaabad par se congress kaa daawa chhod diya or unhen sipiem ko dene par sahmati jataa di
 According to CPM Secretary Sitaram Yechury who gave the 'electoral Strategic Understanding' formula in the 2016 Assembly, the combined vote share of Left and Congress was 38
 61 fisadi tha, jabaki sattarudh tiemasi ko 44 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Left parties and the Congress fought separately but their combined vote was 39 per cent, while tmc's vote share was only slightly higher than 39
 3 fisadi tha
 Congress veteran Abdul Mannan says, "at a time when there is dissatisfaction against TMC and resentment against Narendra Modi, the congress-left alliance could be of great benefit

 ) He was in a serious dilemma about Maharashtra when Narendra Modi was meditating on the formation of his cabinet — make Gopinath Munde a minister at the center or give him the command of assembly elections in the state after 4 months
 lekin shapath grahan ke aathven din hi sadak haadase main munde kii aakasmik maut ne modi or bijepi kii peshaani par bal daal die hai
 Says a senior Union minister, "there was a fast thought towards projecting Munde as Chief Minister, but the decision was not taken
 ”bijepi kii chintaa kii badi vajah maharashtra main munde ke kad kaa koi bada netaa nahin hona he
 After Pramod Mahajan and Munde, there is no such big leader in Maharashtra who can challenge a person like Sharad Pawar
 munde ke baad kii peedi main devendra fadanvis, vinod taavade or sudhir mungantiwar jaise chehre hai, lekin unka kad utana bada nahin he
 Nitin Gadkari's stature has increased in the BJP, but his image is not that of a coordinator like munde-mahajan
 munde ne bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kaa vistaar kar use mahayuthi banaaya, jiskaa laabh loksabhaa chunaav main mila
 The Gadkari group was once engaged in giving importance to Raj Thackeray

 It will be very difficult for Maharashtra BJP to fill Munde's place which reached the summit by way of struggle
 notebandi ke baad se upi main congress kii chunavi yatra or prachaar abhiyaan par brake lag gaya he

 UP In-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad, Sanjay Singh, PCC Raj Babbar, Sheela Dixit and Pramod Tiwari are also present in the core committee meeting
 upi ke chunavi ran main dangal se pehle hi congress kii hawa nikalati dikh rahi he

 PK is accused of imposing his own arbitrary without consulting
 pike diarectpriyanka wadra or rahul gandhise baat karte hai
 In such a situation, the leaders of UP are upset with him
 pike or party main upi chunaav ke kharch ko lekar bhi tol-mol chal rahaa he
 Clearly, the growing differences are heavy on Congress propaganda
 upi main nahin chalegaa priyanka brahmastrajab shila dikshit upi kii siem ummidavaar bani, to unhone kaha ki priyanka wadra ke aane se upi main congress ko majbootee milegi
 However, when she comes, she will make her decision
 lekin, badalte siyaasi sameekaran mencongress kaa prachaar abhiyanadhima padataa najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress high command is also silent on Priyanka, due to which the planning of PK has gone awry

 The anger of Saifullah's death and the fear of revealing the secret from the captured terrorists, both of these reasons increase the risk of terrorist attack, because 6 terrorists are still out of the grip of the security forces

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah agar 2014 par palat kar najar daalen to kah sakate hai ki unke liye yah chamatkaaron kaa varsh rahaa or unhen is sukh se vanchit rakh paanaa naammumkin he
 With a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the BJP not only captured power in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand, but also emerged as the largest party in Jammu and Kashmir by vote percentage
 unki khushi main chaar chand is baat se lage ki congress loksabhaa main sabase kam sankhya main simat gai or 2014 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main doosraa sthaan bhi nahin paa saki
 In this way, Modi's election slogan of "congress Mukt Bharat" was seen in reality
 ab yah koi aashcharya kaa vishay nahin rah gaya he ki bijepi ke is ufaan or bulandi ke centre main modi kii lokapriyata he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, he continued to speak about the country in one voice, campaigning in electoral states and in foreign capitals
 par ranchi, jammu or srinagar se chunaav parinaam milane ke saath hi party ko yah sach bhi samaj main aane laga he ki modi lahar kii bhi ek seemaa he
 If this cup is seen as half empty, then the BJP has barely crossed the majority mark in Jharkhand and in the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh, it could not even open the account even after fighting hard
 iskaa matlab kya hua? party ke bheetar ke log or raajnneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki 16 may ko aam chunaavon ke nattejey ke baad bhi bijepi kaa rajyon main chunaav prachaar kaa tarika ek hi jaisaa rahaa he
 That is, attack the opposition vigorously, raise the hope of good governance among the people by presenting Modi and BJP as outsiders from power
 lekin ab yah ehsaas jaldi hi ghar kar saktaa he ki dilli kii gaddi par bijepi virajman he
 Then along with this, he may also have to face anti-government sentiments
 shaayad isi ehsaas se satark hokar bijepi ke netaa vipaksh par aarope laga rahe hai ki vah shashan or vikaas se janata kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye dharmantaran jaise mudde oochaal rahaa he or sansad main rukaawat daal rahaa he or pramukh vidheyakon ko paarit nahin hone de rahaa he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu says, "the Opposition is actually trying to create a deadlock in the Parliament by creating a deadlock in the government's development agenda, thereby obstructing the path of many bills that are very important for development
" vipaksh agle bajet main sarkaar ke vikalp simit kar dena chahta he
 Party insiders also say that the results of Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir have made it clear that the BJP underestimated the strength of its opponents in these states
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ‘‘congress kaa pradarshan utana bura nahin rahaa jitani hamane ummid kii thi
 The national conference also did not flow in this wave
 ’’ unke mutabik party ko lagata he ki jammu-kashmir main use kam-se-kam paanch siten ummid se kam milin
 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) emerged as a challenge in Jharkhand
 usne sarkaar main rahane or sarkaar virdohi bhaawanaaon ke baavjood apni siten badha leen
 These are eye-opening lessons for the BJP ahead of the 2015 elections in Delhi and Bihar
 party adhyaksh amit shah ke kashmir main piples democratic party (pidipi) yaa neshnal conference (ensi) se haath milaane ke sanket se bhi saaf he ki haryana or maharashtra main ekala chalo kii ranneeti par chalane vaali party kitna faasla tay kar chuki he
 However, this is bound to make the bjp's current allies apprehensive in other states, as the party's opportunistic trend is now becoming clear
 puure desh ko bhagava rang main rangane kii tamanna puri karne ke liye bijepi ko tamilnadu, orissa or shaayad pashchim bengal main bhi sahyogiyon kii jarurat padane vaali he
 Therefore, it will probably learn from the successful experience of NDA-1 and adopt a uniform policy of alliances and show respect and generosity to allies, as it did during the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 isamen do raay nahin ki 2014 kii jeet kaa nasha utarane or ek saal kaa shashan puraa hone ke baad modi or shah ko phir se kori salate par lautnaa hoga or apni chunavi ranneeti par nae sire se gaur farmana hoga

 Production 6 from KG D-6 block in March 2010
 15 karod ghan meter pratidin rahaa tha
 One of the main reasons for this decrease in production is the pressure phenomenon in the wells
 keji-di6 kii vikaas yojana ko 2006 main manjuuri di gai thi jiske anusaar iskaa utpaadan ab 7
 It should have been 039 million cubic meters per day, but the actual production is much less

 After Haryana, now in Uttar Pradesh too, due to the ever increasing gap in Linganupas, terrible results are now coming out
 vaise to linganupaat main antar puure uttar pradesh main he, lekin agra main yah sankat itnaa bad chukaa he ki yuvaaon ke liye dulhanon kaa sankat ho gaya he
 The society of Uttar Pradesh may have to face many serious consequences of this problem in the coming time
 isse samaaj main bad rahe aparaadhon ko bhi rokna kathin hoga
 The situation is most severe in Agra, where, at mass wedding programs, introductions to pre-marriages, a girl is meeting four boys
 dulhanon kaa abhaav is kadar bad gaya he ki is ilaake main vibhinn jatiyon main samuhik vivaah kaa prachlan teji se bad rahaa he
 According to the ceremony performers, there was no such problem till seven-eight years ago
 tab ladakiyon kii sankhya zyada or ladakon kii sankhya kam hoti thi
 By July this year, several castes, including Mathur Vaishya, Brahmin, Punjabi, Kshatriya, held eight mass introduction and marriage conferences
 inamen teen hajaar yuvak or maatr ek hajaar yuvatiyaan shaamil huin
 115 women were registered at the introduction conference of Varshneya Samaj held at Mathur Vaishya Mahasabha Bhawan, Pachakuiya
 vahiin yuvakon kii sankhya 467 rahi
 This situation is not visible in any caste, but in every caste
 agra main hone vaale in parichay sammelnon ne kanyaon ke janm or unki suraksha kii tamaam yojanaon kii pole khol di he
 According to the 2011 census data, however, the male-female ratio has improved in Agra
 yahaan mahila linganupaat badha he
 The number of women per 1000 persons in the year 2011 in the entire district is 859
 varsh 2001 main yah anupaat 846 tha
 In Agra city alone, the number of women was 851 in 2001, which has increased to 857 in 2011
 kuch saamaajik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yah linganupaat swaabhaavik he
 He says that the way there is still a sense of difference between boys and girls in the society, due to this there will be a problem
 iske tahat ladakon ko shaadi main pareshaani aegi
 Also, when the number of men in the society will be more than women, due to this decrease, the number of crime in the society will increase

 They do not even have stairs to go from their house to the terrace
 is cese ne police kii jaanch par kai gambhir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Question raised on police investigation- Police arrested two kidnappers, but how to file chargesheet without recovering child? - If the police theory was correct, how did Zaid's corpse hit the roof of his neighborhood? - If The dead body was lying on the roof of the neighbor, so why did no one smell the rot? - What did the house that did not have a ladder for roof, which did not go up for one and a half years, go to this day? upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main ek baar phir gangrape kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he

 You must have heard the example of building the Taj Mahal in love and breaking the stars from the sky, but hardly know about the reality of climbing the mobile tower in memory of your grandfather's grandfather
 haryana ko jind main ek aise hi dada hai jo apane pote ke juda hone ke baad 120 foot oonche tower par chadh gaye
 The case is of Bahadurgarh village in Jind
 tower par chadhe 52 varshiya krishna kaa kahana tha ki jab tak uske pote ko uske mamaa ke ghar se nahin laayaa jaataa tab tak vahatower se nahin utrenge
 However, after the top officials reached the spot, he got down from the tower
 lekin dada ke is karname se vahaan maujuud sabhi log chaunk jarur gaye
 Safidon police station in-charge r Kumar reached the spot along with the police team and Krishna was requested to come down
 lekin unka saaf kahana tha kaha ki jab tak unke pote ko nahin laayaa jaataa vah nahin utrenge
 If someone tries to take them off, they will shrink and give up their lives
 iske baad 5 ghante tak maan munwwal kii gai tab jaakar dada krishna tower se utre
 Only after this, the people present there lost their lives
 krishna ke chote bete soma ne bataaya ki uske bade bhai kaa chaar varshiya ladkaa avlok kareeb chaar maheene se samalkha ke gaanv dheraa main apane mamaa ke ghar gaya hua he
 His father Krishna did this feat to demand that he be recalled
 har baar haq or aarakshan ke naam par andolan or virodh-pradarshan hote hai
 Every time some become victims of violence in the name of innocent movement
 har baar police prashasan or sarkari mashinari naakaam sabit hoti he
 The same happened during Bharat Bandh on Monday
 haq kii ladaai ne hinsak rup le liya or 10 begunaahon ko apni jaan ganvaani padi
 But the question is, who is the perpetrator of the 10 deaths? In Madhya Pradesh, the maximum death occurred in the whole country
 jahaan saat logon kii jindagi dalit kanoon kii aag ke chalate kaal ke gaal main samaa gai
 One died during a demonstration in Firozabad in UP
 rajasthan main ek or bihar ke hajipur main bhi hinsak pradarshan ne ek maasoom kii jaan le lee
 Who will answer these questions? Knowing everything, why are such situations allowed to happen? The Supreme Court of the country gave a decision on March 20 to change the SC / ST Act
 justise eke goyal or justise you
 Yu Lalit gave this decision
 jiske baad se dalit samaaj main court ke is faisle ko lekar virodh kiya ja rahaa tha
 Under the leadership of the Constitution Save Conflict Committee, people of Dalit society were protesting in different parts of the country
 jiske baad 2 april ko bharat band bulaayaa gaya
 The administration was fully aware of this
 punjab sarkaar ne suraksha pukhta hone ke daawey bhi kiye or ehtiyathan bacchon kii pariksha bhi radd kii
 But on Monday, when the Dalit society took to the streets in protest, from Punjab to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and UP became a battleground
 kyon dangaiyon ko sadak par khuleam hinsa kii chhot di gai?desh main kareeb 17 fisadi dalit aabaadi he
 Political parties, including all Dalit organizations, also announced support for this bandh
 jisase ye tay tha ki badi sankhya main log virodh main utrenge
 In this way, there is also a possibility of untoward incident in the crowd and the police-administration will be well aware of this with the state governments
 lekin jab pradarshnkaree somvaar subah baahar nikle to unhone jamkar tandav machaaya or unhen rokane vaali police sirf kuch hi jagah najar ai
 Did the police and security forces of the government fall short in front of the violent mob? Law and order is a matter of state governments, in such a manner that the peaceful shutdown of Bharat Bandh was also their responsibility
 kendriya khufia vibhaag ke alaava elaiu ke rup rajya sarkaar kaa apana khufia tantra hota he
 In such a situation, it cannot be denied that governments are not aware of where and how many people can gather during Bharat Bandh
 baavjood iske jo tasviren saamne ain, usamen hinsak ke bheed ke aage police bebas dikhi
 More crowds were seen on the streets than the police
 police thanon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Policemen were stoned
 deshbhar main hinsa bhadakne ke baad kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne rajya sarkaron ko har prakaar kii madad kaa vaada kiya
 In such a situation, if the central force was already provided to the state governments, today the picture would have been different
 kya in sanghathanon ke hinsak pradarshan ke peeche siyasat thi?bharat band kaa samarthan karne vaale somvaar se hi ye daawey kar rahe hai ki daliton ko badnaam karne ke liye is andolan ko hinsak banaaya gaya
 There have also been reports of political people being involved in this violence from many places
 meerut main varisht police adhikari ne saarvajanik taur par bataaya he ki shahar main hinsa ke peeche ek netaa kii sajeesh he, jo bahujan samaaj party ke purv vidhayak hai
 At present, former BSP MLA Yogesh Verma has been arrested
 sabase bada or antim sawaal ye he ki aakhir 10 begunaah logon kii mauton kii jimmedaari kiski he
 Because people took to the streets against changes in the law
 bheed ne tandav machaaya
 The police were attacked
 police ne lathicharge kiya
 Also fired
 is puure sangharsh main 10 jaane chale gayi
 Now the question is whether the police who are firing is responsible or the state governments which are unable to maintain law and order or the central government who filed a late reconsideration petition or the politics of inciting the Dalits who have gone to protest for their right to fight Shining leaders
 kisi kii to javabdehi tay honi chahie?bataa den ki madhyapradesh, rajasthan or upi main bijepi kii sarkaar he, jabaki bihar main jediu ke saath bijepi kii gathbandhan sarkaar he
 While Congress is in power in Punjab
 khaskar empi, rajasthan or upi main hinsa kaa khulaa khel najar aayaa

 It is said that Manmohan Singhbada had brought good laws, which made the farmer again a zamindar after 118 years
 syapa he ki narendra modi ek aisa kanoon laa rahe hai jo kisaanon ko sadq par laa degaa
 Just like Balraj Sahni's family of poor farmer came on the road in the film 'do Bigha Zameen', which came half a century ago
 meri apni hikmat yahi kah rahi he ki manmohan kaa kanoon modi ke kanoon se zyada kisaan hitaishi tha
 And the balance of majority in Parliament is saying that Modi people will have to bow before Manmohan people, if not today
 lekin kya isse jameen batch jaaegi
 Does land save by enacting laws that protect the land
 or kya kheti karne ke baad jo fasal ugti he, usase kisaan apana pet bhar saktaa he
 If this is the case, why are the countries going away from India for a number of centuries in the country
 kyon bihar, purvanchal, uttarakhand, urisa or ab bundelkhand ke gaanvvaale majuri ke liye bade shaharon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 When Manmohan had brought a good law, this migration should not have stopped, at least
 mujhe aisa hi lagata tha
 i went to a village near Jhansi in connection with any such election reporting
 gaanv ko ambedkar gaanv kaa darja hasil tha
 Till there was a paved road
 gaanv ke indira awaas bhi thik bane the
 There were also toilets in them, which are said in the government advertisements - Not thinking toilets
 inke liye alag se paisa miltaa he
 But the villagers were using them as storerooms and following the tradition of direction-ground for solving doubts
 khayr, baat kheti kisaani kii ho rahi thi
 The crops were swaying in the fields
 paanch saal kaa sookhaa khatm hue saal bhar ho chukaa tha
 The Bundelkhand package of 7000 crores was making separate news
 aise main maine buudhe dalit kisaan se poocha- fasal to acchhee dikh rahi he
 He nodded yes
 maine aage joda- to ab dilli janaa band ho gaya hoga
 He extinguished the bidi and expressed his obedience to me
 phir bolaa- fasal acchhee ho jaaegi to bhi kya hoga
 The father had four bighas, now for such a large family, he will not have to live in so much land
 bina dilli jaae kaam nahin chal saktaa
 The rest of the farmers also said yes to that old farmer that afternoon
 main kheti kisaani kaa jaankaar nahin hum, lekin moti buddhi bhi lagaaein to desh ke 50 fisadi se zyada kisaan isi tarah choti jot ke kisaan hai
 And those who are of slightly larger holdings, their condition is not very different
 mujhe aaj tak vah kisaan sammelan nahin bhuulataa jisamen majholi jot ke kai kisaan isliye hathe se ukhd gaye the, kyonki manaregaa ne chait kaatane waalon kii mazdooree kaa str badha diya tha
 These farmers were saying that if they give so much money then what is the meaning of farming
 bahut se aise sarkari naukari vaale logon ko bhi jaanata hum jo kehete hai ki agar tankhwaah hataa den to kheti ke sahare gaanv main izzat se rahanaa sambhav nahin he
 If all these classes are included then it becomes 90 percent of the agricultural society of the country
 is samaaj ke liye kheti parampara he, jeene kaa ek dharra he, ek kism kii aadat he lekin khushhaal jivan jeene kii guarantee nahin he
 This farming society stands behind for centuries
 use uske aalu kaa, pyaaj kaa, gehun kaa or takreeban har upaj kaa sabase kam daam miltaa he
 If his potato is sold for 2 kg, his luck is awakened, even though the potato tikki is Rs 25 and Uncle Chips weighing Rs 100 is available in the market
 agar uski jameen kii keemat hataa bhi den to bhi vah apane salanaa mehtaane kaa bamushkil 5 fisadi hi upaj kii keemat ke rup main hasil kar paata he
 The farmer is in such a loss business that if he has complete confidence in the real account, then a large population of the country will go directly into depression
 or agar vah kisi tarah apni upaj kaa sahi mol maang baithe to mahangaai saatven aasmaan pahunch jaae
 That is why the system keeps praising a blur in which there are talks of farmer interest and the farmer is won even after cursing the system
 munshi premchand ko to 30 ke dashak main hi dikh gaya tha ki chote kisaan kheti nahin kar paaenge
 In his famous story 'pus Ki Raat', Hulku gives up farming
 aazaadee ke baad se sarkarein har baar kuch aisa karti raheen ki halku kheti chhodte-chhodte rah gaya, lekin kheti karne kii uski dushwariyaan pehle se kam bhi nahin huin
 In such a situation, by giving a push to the dying farmer by sesame and til, the Modi government wants to get rid of this ajaab
 kheti main munafa sirf aadhunik kheti, badi jot, kisaan ke paas hording kii kshamta, beemaa cover or manovanchit bazaar tak pahunch se hi aa saktaa he
 And so many things can happen only in Sethji, not in the farmer
 badi companiyaan bade kheton main fasal ugaakar uski moti keemat vasuul sakati hai, ve use process kar sakati hai
 Their expensive produce can survive in the market with strong marketing
 yahi vah model he jisaki taraf manmohan or jetali donon kii arthniti hamen le janaa chaahati he
 The laws of the land are tingling, the real power is hidden in this economy
 aise main kanoon koi bhi aa jaae- jameen bachaana mushkil he
 Giving information in a written reply in Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar said that under the PMGKY, there is a provision of both 50 percent tax and surcharge on unaccounted deposits in banks
 iske alaava ghoshnaa karne vaale ko kul raashi ke ek chauthai hisse ko chaar saal tak bina byaaj vaale khate main rakhana hoga

 In the year 2010, on the morning of 15 May, 6 people aboard two speed boats came near the ship 'al Vatul' going to Korsakkan via Strait of Hormuz
 
 
 unhone dur se pani maanga
 
 
 The captain of the ship gave water
 
 
 or boat pani lekar waapas chali gai
 After taking a round in the far sea, the same speed boat returned again in about five-seven minutes
 
 
 vot main se 4-5 log chalate jahaaj se latake tiron ke sahare plateform par chadh aae
 
 
 And as soon as the climb started firing
 
 
 
 ' apane saath ghati anhoni kaa vrutant sunaate cadet bhupendra singh bataate hai, 'jahaaj ke captain vikram singh baahar nikle to sabase pehle unheen par hamalaa kar diya gaya
 They were controlled and all the people on the ship were asked to gather at one place
 is dauraan chif ejeeniyar narendra kumaar ne kuch harakat kii to unhen chaaku se ghayal kar diya
 Two cadets Sarwan Singh and Jitendra Singh hid in two different places in this chaos
 baaki ke logon ko gherkar ek kamare main thel diya gaya
 Some people were ordered to keep all the luggage aside
 sara saamaan tathaa haathon main or jebon main jo kuch tha wo sab chin liya gaya
 ' 'iske baad, brij main jaakar radar, jeepies or viechaef system ko tod daalaa
 Handling satellite phones, mobile phones, walkie talkie, went back on speed boat
 jate-jate kamare kaa darwaja bhi band kar gaye
 If there was complete peace on the ship for a while, the courage of the eight people broke out the door and came out
 vahiin kahin chipa hue jitendra singh bhi baahar nikal aayaa
 Saravan's body was lying near a cupboard in his room
 jo daakuon ko dekhakar shaayad usee almaari main chhip gaya tha
 When the bandits searched the cupboard, he fell in front of them and shot him, which led to his immediate death

 The ship was not able to 'move' much due to the mild storm
 
 
 so lungar daal diya gaya
 ' lekin, khatra abhi tala nahin tha
 
 
 Everyone was still trying to breathe a sigh of relief that Ordinary Seaman Bhupendra Singh was again seen approaching another speed boat
 yah boat irani coast guard kii thi
 He immediately ordered to raise the anchor and said that you have come to the Iranian maritime border without permission and are in custody
 valsad ke bhupendra singh, jaipur ke vikaas choudhary, bhumram ruundala or ratiraam jat (donon bhai), ranchi ke amit kumaar, ludhiana ke jitendra singh, bhivani ke vikram singh, rewadi ke narendra kumaar, maharashtra ke prakaash jadhav tathaa aligarh ke sarwan singh ne hyderabad ke ek marchent navy prashikshan santhaan si-horse academy of marchent navy main pravesh liya tha

 yuvakon ne apane parijanon ko bataaya tha ki ve sharajah se iran tel ke aayaat-niryaat karne vaale jahaaj par tainaat hai
 All these people taken in custody were brought to Iran's island Khishm and kept there for about two and a half months
 iske baad unhen bandar abbaas par shift kar diya gaya
 They were kept here for 18 months
 sabhi cadet kisi tarah bhartiya vaanijya duutavas se sampark karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Finally came to fruition and on February 1, 2011, embassy officials arrived to meet after nearly 11 and a half months
 lekin santvanaa ke do bol bolne ke bajaay unhone apni samasyaon or kuch na kar paane main sakasham hone kaa ronaa hi royaa
 Here, this news started spreading in media circles in India
 jahaaj par maujuud cadeton kii khabar na milane par unke chintit parivarijan lagaataar prayaas kar rahe the ki kisi tarah koi khoj khabar mili
 Family members also fasted at Jantar Mantar

 Here in India also the families of these cadets contacted the Indian Consulate in Bandar Abbas
 baar-baar phone karne par karrwai kaa ‘aashwaasan’ mila
 But nothing more happened
 yuvakon main se ek bhupendra singh ke pita rajendra singh choudhary or ruundala bandhuon ke rishtedaaron ne bharat main irani duutavas or videsh mantralay se bhi jaanane kii koshish kii lekin nateeja

 In this regard, the families of all the missing cadets also requested President Pratibha Devi Singh Patil and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for help
 26 farvari ko ek baar phir se bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ke kuch adhikari in cadeton se milane bhi pahunche
 This time too, he did not have much to say and do
 18 maheenon ke dauraan lagaataar chali kanoonee karrwai main bhartiya vaanijya duutavas pangu hi najar aayaa
 The comments lekin, avaidh pravesh kaa maamla or kisi bhi prakaar kii taskari main lipt na hone ke chalate aakhirkaar 29 farvari kii vah subah in logon kii jindagi main nayaa savera lekar ai jab unhen bataaya gaya ki ve ab chhootane vaale hai

 ghar lautne ke baad se abhi tak in logon kii jahaaj par niyukti karaane vaale agent or jahaaj ke maalikon se koi sampark nahin ho paaya he
 Cadet Bhupendra Singh, narrating the incident with him, says, "when Captain Vikram Singh came out of the ship, he was attacked first
 unhen kaabo main kar jahaaj par maujuud sabhi logon ko ek jagah ikattha hone ke liye kaha gaya
 During this, Chief Engineer Narendra Kumar did some action and injured him with a knife
 is afratfari main do cadet sarwan singh or jitendra singh do alag-alag jagahon par chhip gaye
 The remaining people were surrounded and thrown into a room
 kuch logon ko sara lages ek taraf rakhane kaa hukum diya gaya
 All the belongings and everything in the hands and pockets were taken away
 ' 'after this, radar, GPS and VHF systems went across the bridge
 satellite phone, mobile phone, walki toki ko apane hawaale kar waapas speed boat par savaar hokar chale gaye
 While leaving, the door of the room was also closed
 kuch der tak jahaaj par puri tarah shanti rahi to himmat jutakar aathon log darwaja todakar baahar nikle
 While hiding somewhere, Jitendra Singh also came out
 vahiin baaju ke kamare main ek almaari ke najadik sarwan kii laash padi thi
 Who might have hid in the same cupboard seeing the bandits
 daakuon ne jab almaari kii talaashi lee to vah unke saamne pad gaya or use goli maar di jisase uski turant maut ho gai
 So far, Amit Kumar, who was looking for Saravanan, also arrived
 sarwan ke shav ko deep freezer main rakh diya gaya
 ' saathi cadat bhumram bataate hai, 'sabhi logon ne brij main jaakar dekha to vahaan sab kuch tutaa-phuta padaa tha

 abhi sabhi log raahat kii saans lene kii koshish kar hi rahe the ki ordinary siman bhupendra singh ko phir se ek or speed boat jahaaj ke nikat aati dikhaai di
 The boat was from the Iranian Coast Guard
 unhone turant lungar uthaane kaa aadesh dete hue kaha ki aap log bina anumati ke irani samudri seemaa main aa gaye ho or castady main ho

 ’ The government reduced the 28 per cent tax on many items to 18 per cent at the GST Council meeting on Saturday, while some state governments have opposed the government's move
 in sarkaron kaa maananaa he ki 28 pratishat ke tex slab ko 18 pratishat karne se rajyon ko milane vaale tex main kami aegi
 Government sources told India Today that in the 31st GST meeting held on Saturday, the Congress opposed the government's proposal to reduce the 28 per cent tax to a lower tax slab
 bijepi ke ek sutara ne kaha, 'ab ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki gabbar singh koun he
 These are the twins of the Congress and other opposition parties
 saarvajanik taur par ye partiyaan maang karti hai ki 28 pratishat kaa tex slab khatm kiya janaa chahie or sabhi saamaan kam tex main rakhe jane chahie
 Whereas in the GST Council meeting, Congress, TMC, CPM and Aam Aadmi Party opposed the tax cuts
 'jiesti council kii baithak main 6 saamaanon ko 28 pratishat tex ke daayre se baahar karne kaa faisla liya gaya
 Prior to the meeting, there were 34 items within the scope of 28 percent
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki 'jiesti rate katautee se sarkari rajasav par 5500 karod rupye kaa asar padegaa
 The items which have come out of the 28 percent range are special - up to 32 inch TV sets, lithium power banks, video games, digital cameras, re-trader rubber, small sports items etc
 divyangon ke liye upyog main aane vaale saamaanon par se 28 pratisat tex hataakar 5 kar diya gaya he
 However, this decision was very rude
 sutron kii maane to jiesti council ke adhikariyon ne jaise hi tex ghataane kaa prastaav aage badhaayaa, virodh main sabase pehle kerala ke vitt mantri thomas isaac aage aa gaye
 In the meeting he was heard saying that tax should not be reduced on anything as it is not the right time
 isaac kaa saath puducheri ke mukhyamantri ve narayansami ne diya jo philhal vahaan vitt kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 Sources said that the Finance Minister of Karnataka (there is congress-jds government) also supported Isaac
 bengal ke vitt mantri amit mitra ne bhi tex dar ghataane kaa virodh kiya
 Mitra was heard in the meeting saying that if the decision to reduce the tax is taken at such inappropriate time, then the Center should also extend the compensation period to the states
 aam aadmi party ne bhi sarkaar ke is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 a leader who attended the meeting said that Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal kept his stand neutral
 dilachasp baat yah he ki chhattisgarh or rajasthan kii nai sarkaar ne apana koi mantri nahin bheja or adhikariyon ko baithak main shaamil karaayaa
 Whereas the newly elected Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath neither sent a minister nor any officer
 bijepi shasit pradesh ke ek vitt mantri ne kaha, 'tex main katautee kaa prastaav rokane kii congress or anya partiyon kii koshish unke us stand ke khilaaf he jiske tahat ve saarvajanik dhang se tex ghataane kii maang karti rahi hai
 a source quoting Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswasarma told India Today that 'opposition parties opposed tax cuts and supported higher revenue earnings
 'is bich vipakshi dal shasit ek pradesh ke vitt mantri ne kaha ki 'jiesti council kii baithak main shuru se is baat par jor diya jaataa rahaa he ki mantri apni baat aazaadee se rakh sakate hai
 Many states have reservations that the Union and bjp-ruled states are proposing to reduce GST in view of general elections
 yah kadam raajnneeti se prerit he kyonki pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi kah chuke hai ki 99 pratishat chijen kam tex ke daayre main rakhi jaaengi
 The Prime Minister wants to take credit for it
 ' Voting will be held on Wednesday, November 28 for all 40 seats in the Mizoram Assembly elections
 chunaav se teen din pehle congress netaa or mukhyamantri lal thanahawala ne ravivaar ko kaha ki yadi chunaavon ke baad sattadhari congress ko bahumat nahin mil paata he to aisi haalat main vah bijpi or emenef ko chhodkar samaan vichaardhaara vaali partiyon ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar khulaa rukh apnayegi
 However, the Congress claimed that such a situation would not arise as the Congress would get an absolute majority on its own
 mizoram main sarkaar banane ke liye 21 vidhayakon kii jarurat hoti he
 Lal Thanhawla said that if like-minded parties come to me and want to support my leadership, they can be welcomed
 mukhyamantri se poocha gaya tha ki chunaavon ke baad saadhaaran bahumat nahin milane kii sthiti main kya congress gathbandhan karegi
 Asked whom the Congress would feel comfortable in alliance with, he said, 'I do not know this now, but will not at all combine with BJP and MNF
 baaki samay aane dijie
 bjp's path is not easy in the elections on Wednesday for the 40 assembly seats in Mizoram
 yahaan mizo neshnal front (emenef) ke taur par sahyogi hone ke baavjood party abaki baar akele hi chunaav lard rahi he
 At present, the Congress is headed by Lal Thanhawla in the state

 The Congress is eyeing a third consecutive victory
 maujuuda vidhansabha main congress ke 34 vidhayak hai jabaki emenef ke paanch or mizoram pipuls conference kaa ek vidhayak he
 The Congress increased its seats in 2013
 jabaki 2008 main uske paas 32 siten thim
 After being in power twice in a row, Congress seems to be facing difficulties in Mizoram due to internal strife and anti-incumbency

 On the first day of the SAARC summit on Wednesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif came face to face, the two did not even look at each other
 yahaan tak ki shaam ko dinar par bhi donon ne ek-duusare ko nazarandaaj kiya
 But on Thursday, when the two leaders met face-to-face in Dhulikhel, 40 km from Kathmandu, both of them asked each other about their well being
 jab saarc ke manch par modi ne paak ko gheraavaise donon ke bich koi aupchaarik baatcheet nahin hui
 But when face to face, both of them shook hands with each other

 Political rhetoric further soured the relations between the two countries
 baatcheet par bharat kaa do took kahana he ki jab tak anukool maahaul nahin hota tab tak koi vaarta nahin
 At the same time, Pakistan says that if India has canceled the talks, then it is the responsibility of the neighboring country to resume it

 The police of Sihani Gate Police Station, Ghaziabad, UP have arrested five miscreants
 ye paanchon koi maamuli lutere nahin hai, balki police kii vardi main lutpaat karne vaale wo badmaash hai, jo vardi ke dam par apana kaam to aasaan kar hi lete hai
 The credit of the police is also discounted, which is not left untouched, but by coincidence the fate of these miscreants was lost
 jaankaree ke mutabik, sabhi badmaash chori kii ek honda city car main aligarh ke gabhaana ke toll plaza ko luutane ke liye nikle the
 But while checking in on the way, the police had some doubt about the antics of these miscreants
 police ne jab unhen hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii, to puure maamle kaa khulaasa ho gaya
 Could not bother with the miscreants
 espi city salmaan taj ne bataaya kibadmashone kubul kiya ki unhen khabar mili thi ki toll plaza main jamaa kiye gaye rupee har teen din baad mulajim bank main jamaa karne ke liye lekar jate hai
 Just on the basis of this news, he set out to rob the toll plaza with police uniforms and realities

 bhaajapa ke saath nai sarkaar kaa gathan karne ke baad mukhyamantri nitish kumaar puure ection main najar aa rahe hai
 On Thursday, Nitish held a review meeting of the department with education department officials and took some tough decisions
 nitish ke dwaara liye gaye faislon main sabase mahatvapurn yah he ki jo bhi shikshak 50 kii umr paar kar chuke hai or saalon se ayogy or nikamme sabit ho rahe hai, unako jabarnaritair kiya jaae
 Strict action against such unqualified teachers is being attributed to poor performance of students in this year's matriculation and intermediate exams
 rajya sarkaar ke is faisle se shikshakon main kaaphi aakrosh he or aane vaale dinon main vah ek bada andolan bhi kar sakate hai
 To implement his decision, Nitish Kumar has also formed a three-member committee which will first identify the schools where matriculation and intermediate results were the worst
 skulon ko chinhit karne ke baad vahaan ke shikshakon aurjile ke shikshaapadadhikari par kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 This decision of the government is going to affect at least 5,000 permanent and contractual teachers in the state
 sarkaar vaise teacheron kii bhi chuttee karne ja rahi he, jo shikshak dakshata pariksha main pichley teen baar se fail ho rahe hai
 Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said that there is a provision in the Bihar government that all teachers who have crossed the age of 50 and who are proving to be ineligible for the last several years, should be forcibly retired and using the same provision, the government will use teachers Going to take action is baar ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sabase zyada nuksaan mayawati ko hua he
 However, on the party's poor performance, Mayawati said that it is not going to get sore
 unhone iviem main gadabadi kii ashanka kii baat kahi
 She said that she would complain to the Election Commission in this matter and also demanded the commission to get EVM machines tested
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki iviem ke bajaay bailat se chunaav hona chahie
 He also demanded the commission to cancel the election
 haalanki iske saath hi mayawati ne yah bhi kaha ki bijepi kii jeet loktantr ke liye bada khatra he
 On the other hand, on behalf of the BJP, Union Minister of State Babul Supriyo said that this is really fairwell speech
 ab unka unka mukhya bhoomika main lautnaa mushkil he
 The results this time, however, suggest that this is probably his worst defeat since the bsp's rise
 vaise iskaa is tarah kii haar kaa silsilaa 2012 se shuru hua he or tab se badastoor jari he
 This time Mayawati had given tickets to 100 Muslim candidates under the social engineering formula, but the election results show that this formula has not worked
 tippaniyan Actually, this time the voters of UP have not accepted any form of alliance and formula
 modi lahar main ye formule fail ho gaye hai
 In fact, the biggest reason for the defeat of BSP is that the party has not changed its ways
 jabaki is bich bijepi jaise dalon ne puri tarah se image mekaover kiya he
 These results also show that Mayawati's hold on the Dalit votebank is no longer the same
 unka votbank ab darak gaya he or uskaa nateeja yah hua ki ab upi kii siyasat main haashie par pahunch gai hai
 According to political experts, the other big thing is that the Dalit voters have now turned to BJP
 2007 main soshal ejineering formule ke tahat basapa ne agadi jatiyon or daliton kaa jaateey gathbandhan banaakar itihaas rachaa tha
 But according to experts, this has become a thing of the past for the BSP

 com / j1izuvpg3c aatankwaad se ladane kaa dhindhora peetane vaala pakistan phir benakaab hua he
 Aaj Tak has got a taped conversation between the attackers of Lal Chowk and their handlers across the border
 is baatcheet ke ek-ek lafj main aatankiyon kaa beraham cheharaa jhalkata he
 The mentor orders the terrorists to kill the innocent and despite being injured, the terrorists are asked to fire
 6 janvari ko srinagar kaa laal chowk achaanak bam or goliyon kii aawaaj se gunj uthaa tha
 Terrorists had spoken
 22 ghante kii muthbhed ke baad suraksha balon ne do dehshatgardon ko markar aatanki sajeesh hamale ko naakaam kar diya
 But the truth behind this terrorist attack has been revealed
 yah hamalaa bilkul 26 / 11 kii tarj par hua tha or mumbai ke hamalaavaron kii tarah yahaan bhi aatanki sarhad paar baithe aakon ke sampark main the
 His boss sitting in Pakistan was constantly instructing him through phone
 phone par jo baatcheet hui uske kuch anshvaaka-haloaatanki-salaam vaalekumaka-vaalekum salaam
 Alright, thank you - thank God, i am fine - what is the news, surprise - just nothing
 bas do-teen ko litayaa he
 aita-dothin was litta and
 
 Terrorists - See how many shrieks are being made - Yes, there is a loud voice, Awesome - Yes, the voice is coming, those are the same terrorists who attacked Lal Chowk, who are giving the news of the encounter every moment to the boss sitting across the border on the phone
 Were
 itnaa hi nahin yahaan bhi sarhad paar baitha aakaa aatankiyon ko zyada se zyada khoonkhraba karne ko kah rahaa tha
 When the terrorist was shot, he again spoke to the mentor: pray to Allah
 koi galati hui to maaf karnaaka-insha allaah allaah taala aapako maaf karegaatanki-insha allaah
 Kill insha allahaka-slogans
 maaro inkoatanki-insha allaah
 i slogan and fire
 aakaa-lekin thodaa dur dur baithna
 Because the weapon will be damaged
 kaari ko jarur baithaanise baatcheet se ye bhi saaf ho jaataa he ki muthbhed main maare gaye do aatankiyon main se ek baluchistan se aayaa aatanki kaari tha jise sir main goli lagi thi
 Your bosses are fine, but you have to bandage them so that the blood does not come out of the fire, it is on your mind that fire is not on fire
 aankh kii sidh main aankh or kaan ke darmyaanaka-haa, to abhi ladata he yaa nahinatanki-abhi aakhri saansen chal rahi hai naa, chalata bhi nahin daaen baayenaka-achaaaka-chalo pattee-vatti karnaa
 Do not take tension it is okay
 ye khun jaaya nahin jayegaatanki-insha allahaka-haa lado abhiye baatcheet kaaphi kuch mumbai hamale ke dauraan aakaaon or aatankiyon kii baatcheet se milti julati he
 In such a situation, the question is whether the leader of 26 / 11 is not involved in this attack
 ek baat or, is baatcheet ne ek baar phir pakistan ko benakaab kar diya he
 It is clear from the revelation that the business of terror has crossed the border 
 vahaan unhen training milti he phir wo ghuspaith karte hai or bharat main begunaahon kaa khun bahaate hai
 It is not new that there are allegations of mutual nexus between Imran Khan and China
 2013 main bhi kamobesh sthiti yahi thi lekin tab imran satta tak nahin pahunch paae or ab jab vah pahunch rahe hai to bharat ke liye chunauti badi he
 Foreign policy has always been an intervention in Pakistan in foreign policy
 imran khan ke satta sanbhaalane ke baad vah puri tarah se sena ke haath main hi hoga
 Whenever India's relations with Nawaz government or with any government chosen behind it are big in the direction of improving, either there has been a big terrorist attack or ceasefire violations have been done by Pakistan

 In Delhi MCD elections, trends are visible in 270 seats
 agar yahi rujhaan nateezon main tabdeel hote hai to ye saaf he ki bijepi emsidi main jik kii hetric lagane ja rahi he
 Let us know what the political players of Delhi and the country can mean for these trends? Kejriwal's charisma is over? The Aam Aadmi Party defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly elections
 ye wo vakt tha jab loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pradhanmantri modi kii lokapriyata charam par thi
 On the basis of this victory, many analysts had even told the Aam Aadmi Party as an emerging alternative to the Congress as an opposition party
 lekin emsidi chunaav main mili haar ye sabit karegi ki dilli kii janata ke bich kejariwal kii vishwasaneeyata ghati he
 This is when the party made big claims to provide facilities like electricity, water, education to the poor sections
 lihaaja emsidi chunaav ke nattejey kejariwal and company ko gujarat or himachal pradesh jaise rajyon ke chunavi samar main utarane ke bajaae dilli ke apane garh ko majboot karne par tavajjo dene ke liye majaboor karegi
 It is obvious that the party will not be useful just to break the defect in evms
 bijepi kii balle-balleye koi raaj nahin he ki dilli ke log emsidi ke bhrashtachar se trast the
 The BJP was reeling from the fear of anti-incumbency after two consecutive terms
 yahi vajah he ki party ne kisi bhi maujuuda parshad ko tikat nahin diya
 But a majority in all the three municipal corporations will prove that Modi's wave has now reached Delhi via UP
 is jeet ke baad ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagegi ki maujuuda siyasat main modi hi sabase oonche kad ke netaa hai
 This victory is no less than a win for Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari
 ummid kii ja sakati he ki iske baad unka siyaasi vajan bhi badhegaa or wo party main kisi badi jimmedaari kii aas laga sakate hai
 Congress's comeback If any party had nothing to lose in this election, it was the Congress
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party khaataa bhi nahin khol pai thi
 However, he could not get victory in MCD
 chunaav se pehle arvinder singh lavali or barkhaa singh jaise jane-maane congressi netaaon ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 But giving a tough fight to the Aam Aadmi Party in elections is also nothing short of an achievement for the party
 is nattejey ke baad party is baat par santosh kar sakati he ki rajdhani main uski siyaasi jaden ab bhi sukhi nahin hai or wo kam se kam aam aadmi party ko maat dene main kaamyaab rahi he
 What message for other parties? MCD election was also important for Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan's party Swaraj India
 aam aadmi party se nikaale jane ke baad ye pehla mauka tha jab swaraj india chunavi maidan main utari thi
 However, trends are showing that despite the clear image of Yadav and Bhushan, Delhiites have not given any special faith to them
 rujhaanon main isse bhi zyada buree khabar bahujan samaaj party ke liye chhipi he
 BSP was the third party in Delhi before the Aam Aadmi Party came into the picture
 2012 ke emsidi chunaav main use kareeb 10 fisadi voton ke saath 12 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 But this time not only the seats of BSP but also the base has shrunk

 Let us know about some such domestic tips which can also be fatal for us
 
 
 1
 Use of toothpaste on pimples: Toothpaste has many types of chemicals and if applied on pimples, it can increase bacteria
 isliye aisa karne se bachein
 2
 pilia kii beemaari main chooney kaa panipilia kii beemaari thik karne ke liye kai log gharelu upachaar kaa sahaara lete hai or uske liye marij ko chooney kaa pani pilaayaa jaataa he
 Avoid doing this because the chemicals present in it do not cure jaundice but only exacerbate health problems
 3
 If there is a wart in the wart removal tips and other parts of the body, avoid cutting it with thread, thin wire or blade
 aisa karne se dhaage or taar main maujuudabacteria skin ke andarpahunchakar infections paidaa karte hai
 4
 jaale par makkhan laganabahut se log jalane par makkhan laga lete hai
 If you do some similar measures, then know that the skin is very sensitive and by applying butter, bacteria present in the wound can also spread around
 5
 When tying cloth on the wound, people tie it with a cloth when an injury occurs, it should not be done at all
 aisa karne se chot main hawa nahin lag paati or bacteria bad jate hai
 It takes longer for the wound to heal

 unke saath kaam karke mujhe bahut phayda hota he, meri choti filmon ko log dekhnaa pasand karne lagate hai
 If after working with these three, even if 5% people came to see my short film, then my short film became a hit like that
 kya aap diarector ke actor ho gaye hai?ji ye to nahin pataa lekin main jin diarectors ke saath kaam karata hum unke upar mujhe bahut zyada vishwaas hota he jaise main kabir khan ke saath 'neuyork' main bhi tha or ab'bajrangi bhaijan'main kaam karte vakt bhi unke upar kaaphi bharosa he

 People say that you do most of the roles of 'gray Shed'? See, 'gray Shed' and 'negative Role' are both different types of characters
 negative matlab puri tarah se negative, lekin grey shed matlab alag tarah kaa kirdaar
 In films, heroes and villains are the only characters who do not have a shed, so as an actor i always want to play the same character in which there is a shed
 jisamen kai parate hon, mujhe vahi kirdaar karne main majaa aata he
 There were reports that you were going to play a negative character in the movie 'sultan'? i don't know anything about 'sultan', whatever the reports are, they are wrong
 iske bare main koi bhi baat nahin hui
 How did you prepare for the role of a 'journalist' in 'bajrangi'? i also watched some videos, and also saw friends nearby, so i prepared my character with a few things from them

 Will you only do the lead role? See, for me, the lead role is also like a character
 mere liye 'hero' bhi ek kirdaar hi he
 Have you ever thought about the direction? i do not even know the 'D' of the direction
 main sirf acting kar paata hum
 You named your son 'ie', was it already decided? Yes, i was married when i had planned that if i was a boy, i would be named 'ie' and if i was a girl, i would name 'shohra'
 to ab ladkaa hua to main 'yani' naam rakh diya
 It means 'king of Cool'
 yani 'shantipurna'
 Have you shot in Kashmir? The people of Kashmir are quite straightforward
 vahaan par bahut hi shanti he
 If you will be made a brand of Ambedkar, then you are ready? Absolutely, why not, i definitely will
 'rais' main kis kirdaar main dikhenge?us film main main ek pulisavaale ke kirdaar main hum, ek alag tarah kaa kirdaar he

 The issue of the suspected death of Judge BH Loya, who is hearing the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, is once again hot
 maharashtra main satta parivartan hote hi congress ne jaj loya kii sandigdh maut kii jaanch phir se karaane kii maang kerani shuru kar di he
 The question is, when the Supreme Court has previously rejected the demand for independent investigation, can the state government order a re-investigation? Judge Loya died in the year 2014, but after a report published in a magazine in the year 2017, the death of Judge Loya was questioned

 The question is, can i be investigated again? The state now has a government of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP

 bijepi kaa ek bhi ummidavaar baagi nahin he, upar se lekar neeche tak sab ekajute hai
 He also said that publicizing the leadership crisis in the party only shows that the media has a cloak of issues against the party

 deepika padukon ne apni debyue bollywood film om shanti om main shahrukh khan ke saath kaam kiya tha
 According to a report, imdb released the list of top 10 stars of Indian cinema on Tuesday
 yah suchi imdb pro star meter ranking kaa prayog kar jari kii gai, jo ki is manch par 25 karod ke masik visitors ke vaastavik pej vyuj par aadhaarit he

 New revelations are happening everyday about Rampal
 aaj tak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik rampal apane bhakton ko swarg bhejne or bhagwaan kii jhalak dikhaane ke daawey karata tha or badale main paise anthta tha
 In Rampal's ashram, you remember that Rs 5 lakh masjar was there, not for the sake of Rampal
 darasal, baba ne in samarthakon ko swarg ke sapane dikhaae the
 These were the supporters whom Baba promised to bring to the Lord
 wo bhi muft main nahin balki paise lekar
 Legal circle on the camp! Babagiri will be closed? Heaven and God had a big role in the empire of sin that Rampal had created
 rampal ne ponji skim kii tarah agenton kaa jaal bicha rakhaa tha jo baba ke liye ped bhakt dhundne kaa kaam karte the
 The only difference between the Ponzi scheme and Rampal's sin scheme was that Baba did not pay any agent
 agent kii bhoomika nibhaate the baba ke khaas samarthak, jin par baba ko khud se bhi zyada bharosa tha
 Those agents used to roam in remote villages and narrate stories of Baba's miracles to innocent people
 rampal ke wo agent garibon ko sapane dikhaate ki baba rampal unke saare dukh or ksht dur kar saktaa he
 Can solve all their problems
 baba ke agent bhole bhaale logon ko bargalaate ki rampal swarg bhejne kii takat rakhata he
 Those agents tell people that Baba Rampal has the power to meet God
 jaise hi koi shaks baba kii chamatkaarik takaton par bharosa kar letaa rampal ke agent use lekar satalok ashram main pahunch jate or phir shuru hota aasthaa or andhvishwaas kaa khel
 Rampal used to show many dreams to the supporters who reached Satlok Ashram for the first time and used to collect money from them
 saath hi samarthakon ko kasam khilaai jaati ki harek samarthak baba ke liye teen nae bhakt lekar aayega
 Then that three new devotees would have the responsibility of bringing other new devotees
 aisa nahin he ki rampal ek baar paise lekar apane bhakton ko baksh detaa tha
 It is interesting that Baba fixed the money according to the time
 matlab ye ki jaise jaise bhakthi badhati jaati vaise vaise bhagwaan ko dekhne or swarg ko mahasoos karne kaa charge badhata jaataa

 Star: 3 Artist: Ajay Devgan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Amol Guptirector: Rohit Shetty, who has given great films like Rohit Shetgolmal series, Singham and Chennai Express, is now becoming quite obsolete
 ab film dekhne jane se pehle unki film ke bare main sari baaten pataa hi hoti hai
 Like: there will be a strange villain
 sherdil hero hoga
 There will be dialogues
 halke-phulke maukey honge
 Some trains will fly
 dhamaake honge or sabakuch vaisaa hi hoga jaisaa sochaa tha
 And here comes the crisis of trying something new for a director
 singhm riterns kii baat karen to yah bhi kuch aisi hi film he
 Much like Singham
 film puri tarah se masej ke liye he
 Perhaps Rohit wants to try his formula and does not intend to do anything new
 yah rohit shetty or ajay devgan ke phans ke alaava, masala filmon ke diwaanon ke liye ekadam sahi khuraaq he
 The hero wins and fills the public
 kahani main kitna damakahani kaa to puuchhie mat
 Just like Bollywood directors have taken up the task that the entire film has to be pulled on superstar power only
 isliye unke liye kahani zyada myne nahin rakhti or yah saaf najar aata he ki kala or kahani se bada kalakaar he
 No more brainstorming for the story
 baaji raav singhm mumbai aa jaataa he
 He is as domineering and tough as ever
 kuch nahin badla he
 Here too, he encounters corrupt leaders and contractors of the society
 uski premika he
 Kareena Kapoor who keeps coming back and forth in the film
 dialogbaji he, fiting he or gane aate rahete hai
 Means masala film
 zyada sochna nahin
 Everything is tried in the film
 ab masala filmein to aisi hi hoti he
 Star Appealfilm is completely above Ajay Devgan
 ajay kaa style, acshan or dialogbaji film ko khaas banaati he
 They look good vaise bhi unki pichhali film himmatwala or satyagrah box offis par bada chamatkaar nahin kar saki thim, or ab to superstar club vaise bhi 200 karod ru
 Has been done is tarah unka kaaphi kuch daanv par laga he
 Kareena Kapoor is OK
 amol gupte bhi thik hi hai
 The matter of earning the film is made entirely for the public ie for the message
 yah acchhee baat he
 After watching it on a single screen, the film comes to know that Phultu is a whistleblower
 vaise bhi masala filmon ke phans kii kami nahin
