 To protect the environment, the Modi government is emphasizing on electric public transport

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused the Left parties of disrupting development during his rule in West Bengal and Kerala, saying that he stood on the wrong side of history and was pursuing policies that were not relevant with the changing times
 pradhanmantri ne kottayam or kolum main congress nit udief ke samarthan main yojit chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit karte or vam par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki hamaare vam mitra itihaas ke galat ore khadey hai
 They have failed to understand the fundamental point that the world we live in today has changed a lot and this change is going on
 unhone makapa nit vam sarkaar par sidhe nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki usne raajnneetik avasarvadita ke liye apni vichaardhaara se bhi kinaaraa kiya
 He said that everyone knows how much damage the Left Front suffered during its 30-year rule in West Bengal
 yah galat kaaryakramon ke kaaran he ki aapkaa rajya (kerala) vaise vikaas nahin kar paaya jaise vah kar saktaa tha yaa use karnaa chahie tha
 Dr
 singh ne kerala ke kottayam main 13 april ko hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye pehle chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki yah bahut durbhagyapurna he ki vam dalon ne samay ke saath badalane se inkaar kar diya
 They follow policies and programs that are not relevant over time
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jab main aayaa tha to maine kaha tha ki hamaare vam mitra itihaas kii galat disha main khadey hai
 i repeat it again
 kerala ke bare main baat karte hue da
 Singh said that during the Left Democratic Front (LDF) regime, your state (kerala) did not make as much progress as it could or should
 vam shashan ke dauraan ek taraf jahaan aam logon ke hiton kii andekhi kii gai vahiin makapa kaaryakartaaon ne aam logon kii keemat par laabh kamaaya
 Dr
 singh ne kaha ki ldf kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran udhyamita par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa or nivesh kaa uchit vaataavaran nahin bana jis kaaran rajya kisi tarah kii nijee pariyojna ko akshirt kar paane main asafal rahaa
 On the other hand, Singh also criticized the LDF regime for not taking advantage of the central schemes run by the central government
 is vidhansabha chunaav main sanyukt loktantric morcha (udief) ko jeet dilaane kii apil karte hue singh ne matadaataaon se kaha ki kerala ke tej vikaas ke liye jis cheez kii jarurat he vah aisi sarkaar he jo centre kii samprag sarkaar se kandhe se kandhe milakar kaam kar sake
 Dr
 singh ne kaha ki ldf ateet main rahata he jabaki iske vipareet udief kerala ke bhavishya kii suraksha ke liye khadaa he
 We need to bring changes in current affairs
 hamen vaise vaataavaran kaa nirmaan karne kii jarurat he jo nivesh ko akshirt kar sake or vishesh rup se yuvaaon ke liye adhik rojgaar ke avasaron ko srijan kar sake
 He said that despite the global financial crisis, the country has maintained a high growth rate under the UPA rule
 samaaj ke suvidhahin virgon kii chintaaon kaa khyaal rakhte hue hi vikaas sunishchit kiya gaya
 The entire Nirbhaya scandal that rocked the entire country from Delhi to six years passed
 baaten bahut hui, vaade bhi bahut hue
 But the truth is that nothing has changed on the ground
 aisa ham sirf isliye nahin kah rahe ki nirbhaya ke gunahagaar ab bhi apane anjaam yani faansee ke fande se dur hai, balki isliye bhi kah rahe hai ki ab bhi har rose kahin naa kahin koi nirbhaya kisi darinde ke haathon kuchli ja rahi he
 16 December 2018
 puure chah saal
 Things happened
 virodh hua
 Methods suggested
 sab kuch badal dene ke daawey kiye gaye
 But the sad result is still the same
 halaat ab bhi vahi
 If it had not been so, then that family would not be crying on their fate at this time
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki ek maasoom to umr main bhi nirbhaya se bahut choti thi
 What was rather small? It had been just three years since he came to this world
 lekin choti umr main use ek darinde ne apana shikaar bana daalaa or uske saath zyaadati kii
 To be fair, Delhi again became ashamed at the anniversary of the Nirbhaya incident
 is baar 3 saal kii maasoom se balaatkaar hua
 The neighbor took the opportunity to torture the girl
 ittefaq se logon ne gunahagaar ko range haathon daboch liya or police ke hawaale kar diya
 The case is of Bindapur in Delhi
 teen saal kii choti bacchee ke saath usee ke pados main rahane vaale ek shaks ne zyaadati kii
 Rapakia
 jab bacchee lahooluhaan ho gai or buree tarah hone lagi, to duusare padosiyon ko kuch shaq hua
 When he reached his house, the accused was caught on the spot
 phir to aas-paas ke logon ne use aisa sabak sikhaaya ki kya kehane
 In fact, the parents of this girl went out of the house for work
 or ye bacchee uski badi bahan ke saath ghar main maujuud thi
 Meanwhile, Ranjit Kumar, who works as a security guard, reached his house and kidnapped the girl
 wo bacchee ko lekar apane kamare main aa gaya
 Then it took a disgusting incident like rape of a delicate little girl
 ranjit is bacchee ke makaan kii upree manzil main rahata he
 The matter is very serious in itself, it is a coincidence from above that this incident also happened on the same day when the country was celebrating the sixth anniversary of a heinous incident like Nirbhaya incident
 aise main maamle kaa tool pakadana lazimi tha
 Hence
 
 Delhi Women's Commission Chairman Swati Maliwal took up the matter and once again asked the Prime Minister to make such cases an issue
 baharhaal, is maamle main logon kii madad se gunahagaar to daboch liya gaya
 But perhaps in spite of millions of efforts, that strictness did not come in the law, which would have scared the guilty
 vaise is maamle ko samajhnaa zyaada mushkil nahin he
 The reality is that even after so many years, the throats of Nirbhaya's criminals have not reached the trap of hanging
 kaash, halaat badalen, kaash ladkiyaan mahafooz rahen

 NO AUTO TUNE!! ❤️ Two big lakes in Bangalore city, namely, Belanadur and Varatur
 yahaan ek baar phir pradooshit pani main jhaag tezi se banane laga he
 This poisonous foam blows with the wind and comes on the road
 log isse bachane kii koshish karte dikhte hai kyonki sharir ke jis hisse se ye takaraata he vahaan yaa to tej khujali hoti he yaa phir wo hissaa kai dinon tak kaala rahata he
 This is what we found Harish Patel, who is a software professional and works in a nearby company
 unka kahana he ki aasapaas badboo itani fail jaati he ki usase bachane ke liye room freshnar kaa badi maatra main wo or unke duusare saathi istemaal karte hai, iske baavjood in dinon rahanaa mushkil ho gaya he
 In such a situation, he will soon rent another house
 tippaniyan The situation is believed to have happened recently for two reasons
 pehla tyoharon kii vajah se pani kaa pradooshan kaa str badha or doosraa barish jisane aasapaas kii gandagee pani main milaai
 Although this problem of foam formation in the lake is about 15 years old, but it has increased considerably for the last one and a half years
 kyonki is dauraan kai kal kaarkaane khule lekin pradushan niyantran kii taalf dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Recently there was a fire in the foam of these lakes
 philhal mahanagar palika ne jhaag khatm karne ke liye mazaduron ko pani ke pipe ke saath kaam par lagaaya he taaki jhaag niyantrit rahe or hawa main na ude
 At the same time, sprinkles have been installed at various places so that the foam can be torn as soon as it is formed
 yahi hamen harish patel mili jo kii software profeshnal hai or paas kii ek company main kaam karte hai
 He says that the stench is so spread around that he and his other companions use a large amount of room freshener to avoid it, yet it has become difficult to live these days
 aise main wo jald hi doosraa makaan kiraaye par lenge
 The comments halaat haal main kharaab do vajahon se hue aisa mana ja rahaa he
 First, the water pollution level increased due to the festivals and the second rain which added the filth surrounding the water
 haalanki jhil main jhaag banane kii ye samasya taqariban 15 saal puraani he lekin pichley dedh do saalon se ye kaaphi bad gayi he
 Because during this time many factories opened yesterday but pollution control was not noticed
 inhen jhiilon ke jhaag main haal main aag bhi lagi thi
 Currently the metropolitan municipality has employed workers with water pipes to eliminate foaming so that the foaming remains controlled and does not fly in the air
 saath hi saath jagah jagah par sprinkal bhi lagaaye gaye hai taaki jhaag ko banate hi faad diya jaye

 The 23-year-old batsman of Bangladesh, Mominul Haqane, has played just 13 Tests and averaged 63 in his 24 innings
 90 kaa he
 After 20 innings in the history of Test cricket, this batsman average is second only to Sardon Bradman
 khaas baat yah he ki in 13 test maichon main se keval ek main usne ardhashatak nahin jamaaya yani baaki ke 12 test maichon main yaa to usne ardhashatak yaa phir shatak banaaya he
 Mominul Haque, who has scored four centuries and eight half-centuries so far, has equaled the records of Sachin Tendulkar and John Edrich with his innings of 80 runs and his half-century in 10 consecutive Test matches
 ab unase aage lagaataar 11 maichon main ardhashatak lagane vaale sar vivian richards, virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir or lagaataar 12 test main ardhashatak lagane vaale dakshin africa captain e bi di’williars hai
 That is, this record will be named after scoring half-century in the next two Tests
 baat agar padaarpan ke baad se lagaataar test maichon main ardhashatak ke record kii karen to yah mark tailor or sunil gavaskar ke naam par ab bhi barkaraar he
 He has achieved the feat of scoring half-centuries in 13 consecutive Test matches
 jabaki mominul ne khele gaye 13 test maichon main se 12 main yah karnama kiya he
 Even before this, Mominul has become the fastest cricketer to score the fastest thousand runs after Sir Don Bradman
 unke ek hajaar ran 20 se bhi kam test pariyon main bane
 Mominul Haque, who made his Test debut in 2013, has scored 1,278 runs so far
 unke chaar shatak newjiland, srilanka or zimbabwe ke khilaaf bane hai
 He scored a big Test innings of 181 runs in his fourth Test itself
 mominul haq ek hajaar se zyada ran banane vaale bangladesh ke 12wein test cricketer hai
 Only more Test centuries have been scored by Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Ashraful from Bangladesh
 in donon ke test cricket main chah shatak hai
 Bangladesh cricket is constantly on the rise
 vanade cricket main lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahi bangladesh cricket team ne haal hi main pakistan jaisi majboot team ko na keval vanade balki tii20 mukaable main bhi patkhni di he
 Now this team is facing Pakistan in Test match
 pakistan se lagaataar aath test haar chuki is team ko pehali baar jeet kii aas dikh rahi he or is ummid kaa kaaran bhi mominul haq bane hai
 Mominul has played a big role in taking the team's score to 332 runs
 test maichon kii sabase nai team bangladesh ke ballebaaj cricket kii pich par pradarshan ke badaulat apni ek chhap chhod rahe hai or bahut sambhav he ki mominul kii is pari se bangladesh apana aathvaan antarrashtriya test match jeetne main kaamyaab ho jaae
 If that happens, it would be his first against Pakistan and his first win over a third Test playing team after Zimbabwe, West Indies

 11 agast ko videsh ravaanaa ho jane kii vajah se ve us musiibat se batch gaye jo unke jameen saudon ne congress ke liye paidaa kiya, kyonki bijepi ne is mudde par sansad main hangaamaa karne kaa nirnay le liya tha
 Vadra's land deals have also been questioned in the past
 is baar mudda garmaya iees adhikari ashok khemka ke 105 pej ke ek note se
 In this, he has accused Priyanka Gandhi's husband that he has 3 in Shikohpur village of Gurgaon
 5 acre beshkeemtee jameen ke 'sandigdh saudon’ ke liye farji dastavejon kaa sahaara liya
 Khemka, director general of Land Records, objected to the deal in October 2012 and Vadra and realty giant DLF Universal Ltd
 ke bich jameen ke hastantaran ko nirast kar diya tha
 He was immediately transferred thereafter
 par haryana kii congress sarkaar kii ore se april main karai jaanch main wadra ko clin chit de di gai
 This investigation report stated that Khemka acted out of his jurisdiction by canceling the transfer of land
 magar pichley 22 saal main 44 baar transfar kaa saamana kar chuke khemka isse pareshaan nahin hue or unhone iske jawaab main ek vistrut note taiyaar kar 21 may ko haryana sarkaar ko saunp diya
 In it, he has explained in great detail how the Town and Country Planning Department (DTCP) of the Haryana government, disregarding the rules, "let the capitalist gang act as middlemen so that they could profit on the license acquired for the commercial colony
" Earn and keep cutting the cream
 ”aktubar 2012 main khemka kaa munh band kar diya gaya
 The state government transferred them before they fully exposed the irregularities in the Shikohpur land deal
 lekin is baar unhone sab kuch likhit main rakhaa or wadra ke skylite hospitality privet li
 Revealed the scams made at every step of the deal carried out on behalf of (see box)
 inamen korporation bank ke 7
 5 crores Rs
 ke overdraft kaa 'koi astitv na hone’ kii bhi baat thi jise company ne apane 2008-09 ke bahikhaate main dikhaaya he
 The IAS officer has also mentioned how the license to develop a commercial colony was given to Vadra's company, but he sold it to DLF with huge profits which is completely against the rules
 is baar bijepi ne sansad main is mudde ko uthaane kaa nirnay liya he
 It has abandoned the earlier hesitation that was probably based on the policy that "the children and relatives of the leaders will not be personally attacked
" ” iske peeche yah dar tha ki kal ko bijepi ke netaaon ke saath bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 But this difference from the October 2012 policy is actually a result of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party making fun of BJP and rebuke of RSS
 is baar bijepi ne is mudde ko apane haath main le liya or party adhyaksh rajnath singh, vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, yashavanth sinha, laalkrishna adwani jaise varisht netaaon ke bich 12 agast ko hui charchaa ke baad yah nirnay liya gaya ki is mudde par party congress ko gheregi
 The party was of the opinion that the party would benefit in the 2014 elections by an attack targeting Sonia Gandhi on the issue of corruption
 sansad ke donon sadanon main 13 agast ko aakraamak tareeke se hamalaa bolaa gaya
 For the first time, allegations of corruption reached the feet of Sonia Gandhi
 loksabhaa main bijepi ke saansadon ne 'congress kaa haath, damaad ke saath’ jaise naare lagaae
 He demanded that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) should be investigated under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 loksabhaa main is hamalavar rukh kaa netritv karne vaale yashavanth sinha ne vyangy ke tir chhodte hue congress se yah aagrah kiya ki vah wadra skool of management shuru kare jahaan unke 'anuthe kaarobaari model’ kii padhai ho—ki bina apana paisa lagaae karodon rupye kaise banaae jaaen
 He made Finance Minister P
W
 chidambaram se kaha ki ve is model kaa istemaal ''bhartiya arthvyavastha ko phir se majboot karne or rupye kii giravat ko rokane ke liye kyon nahin karte
 "the Congress was finding it very difficult to defend itself from this attack
 bachaav main kai tarah kii daleelein di gayi, jaise ''ve lok sevak nahin hai, isliye unke kriyalap par sansad main charchaa nahin kii ja sakati” yaa ''yah mudda haryana sarkaar se judaa he
 "sonia kept sitting in silence, hoping that the noise would calm down and that the discussion on the food security bill would begin
 congressiyon ke liye yah kaaphi samvedansheel mudda he
 Nobody wants to discuss it with Sonia Gandhi
 ek varisht congressi netaa kehete hai, ''jab bhi sansad main koi mahatvapurn mudda aata he, congress ke netaa aam taur par iske bare main adhyaksh se charchaa karte hai
 But this is an issue that no one wants to raise
 ”congress ke prabandhakon ko is sankat se nibatane ke liye khud hi jugat lagaani he
 The Haryana government first responded to the issue on 11 August
 yah dilli main congress ke media vibhaag ko bataae bina kiya gaya
 Haryana minister Randeep Singh Surjewala dismissed Khemka's claims, saying, "this is a rhetoric of accusations and sensation from the vested selfish elements
" ”pehle to congress vaale yahi maan rahe the ki is mudde par yah pratikriya paryaapt he
 But when the BJP threatened that it would raise the issue in Parliament, the media managers of the Congress had to rethink their strategy
 party ke samvaad pramukh ajay maakan ne sansad ke baahar kaa jimmaa sambhala to sansad main vipaksh se nibatane kaa jimmaa sansadeey kaary mantri kamalnath ko de diya gaya
 They kept in regular contact with Sushma Swaraj and Jaitley, but neither of them gave any assurance to them
 bijepi ne tab tak apni ranneeti ko antim rup nahin diya tha
 To add to the Congress troubles, Rao Inderjit Singh, a Congress MP from Gurgaon, defended Khemka and demanded an inquiry into all land deals in his parliamentary constituency since 2005
 2005 se hi congress haryana main satta main he
 "there has been a perception that in the last eight years, the land use of large plots of land has been changed from farming to commercial or" other use ", he told India Today
 dharna yah he ki kai rajnatik dalon se jude deshbhar ke kuch diggajon kaa vibhinn bilderon ko license bechakar paisa banane main haath rahaa he
 All these should be thoroughly investigated
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki kisi ek cese ke peeche padaa jaae
 "the angry Congress did nothing immediately on Inderjit Singh's comment, but soon its propaganda system started its work
 gauratlab he ki gadagaanv ke saansad ke haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda se rishte achche nahin hai
 On August 12, at around 3 in the afternoon, Maken called party spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary and asked him to go on the same line that "vadra is personal"
 ” iske pehle jab aktubar 2012 main aisa mudda saamne aayaa tha to renuka ne jor-shor se wadra kaa bachaav kiya tha
 After this, instructions were also given to other spokespersons: Speak as little as possible on this issue and follow the line that "vadra is an Individual" or "ask the Haryana Government about it
" ”yah baad main 13 agast ko party pravaktaa sandip dikshit ke bayaan se bhi saaf ho gaya
 He clearly stated in the media briefing that the issue cannot be debated in Parliament and the BJP is free to question the Haryana government about it or it can, if it wishes, approach the court with questions and complaints about Vadra is
 party pravaktaa ne media ke sawaalon ko haryana sarkaar kii ore modakar philhal to sonia gandhi ko vivaadon ke centre se shaayad hataa liya ho, lekin party ke kai varisht netaaon kaa kahana he ki wadra ab party ke liye baari shame kaa sabab ban chuke hai
 "no one knows when another scandal comes out in his name," says a Congress leader from Rajasthan
 ” wadra ne rajasthan main bhi plot kharide hai
 Whenever the issue of Vadra's questionable land deals comes up, Sonia becomes restless
 abhi tak to unhone is mudde par khamoshi odh rakhi he, jabaki party ke utsaahi netaa tatkaal hi wadra ke bachaav main saamne aa jate hai
 It is clear that he has kept himself away from the affairs of his son-in-law
 is baar priyanka bhi chup hai, jabaki pichhali farvari main jab amethi main vidhansabha chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan unki rajnatik mahatvakanksha saamne ai thi tab priyanka ne wadra kaa bachaav kiya tha
 Congress leaders are hopeful that the issue will end on its own after Independence Day as there will be no functioning in Parliament from August 15 to 18
 ek varisht congressi netaa majaak ke lahaze main kehete hai, ''shaayad ham hafte ke ant tak wadra ke mudde se aazaadee paa jaaen or 19 agast se sansad sucharu tareeke se kaam kar sake
 "but it will depend on how the mood of the opposition party will be when they return to Parliament

 - input IANS Washing face is probably the easiest thing to do
 par kya aapako pataa he jis tareeke se aap apana cheharaa dhote hai wo kitna khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 We often make such mistakes while washing the face, which makes the face lifeless instead of being clean
 yahaan kuch aisi hi galatiyon kaa zikr he jo ham sabhi aamtaur par karte hai:1
 The face wash water should neither be too hot nor too cold
 bahut adhik thanda or bahut adhik garm pani chehre ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 In this case, the face should be cleaned only with lukewarm water
 2
 If you use scrubbers to clean the face, keep in mind that scrubbing is done with soft hands
 varanaa chehre par ragad ke nishaan bhi ban sakate hai
 3
 agar aapako mechap utaarna he to bajaaycheharaa dhone ke aap sabase pehle use coton seacchhi tarah pochh lijie
 Only then clean the face with water
 mechap ko sidhe pani se dhone par mechap ke kan twachaa ke rome-chhidron main chale jate hai jisase wo band ho jate hai
 4
 agar aap apana cheharaa dhone ja rahe hai to sabase pehle apane haathon ko saaf kar lijie
 There is no use to clean face with dirty hands
 5
 Too much washing of face is also not right
 chehre ko baar-baar dhone se chehre kaa nikhaar kam ho jaataa he
 6
 cheharaa dhone ke baad use halke haathon se pochhna chahie
 Rubbing the face is not good at all
 7
 Do not wash the face with soap at all
 agar aapkaa fesavash khatm ho gaya he to bajaay kisi rasinic padaarth ke aap besan kaa istemaal kar sakati hai

 Dhoni has his own logic to send him to number four, but this change does not seem to be taking place before a big tournament like World Cup

 Amidst reports that the BJP is exploring the possibility of government formation in Uttarakhand, former Chief Minister Harish Rawat has urged Governor Krishnakant Pal to be the leader of the largest party in the Legislative Assembly instead of BJP if the President's rule in the state is removed and there is a possibility of government formation
 Due to this, they should be invited first and asked to prove majority in the House
 purv mantriyon dinesh agarwal or preetam singh dwaara kal raat rajbhavan jaakar purv mukhyamantri ravat kii ore se saunpe gaye gyaapan main samachaarpatron or media main ai khabaron kaa hawala dete hue kaha gaya he ki haalanki, in khabaron kii sachai or vishwasaneeyata abhi pusht nahin ho pai he, lekin aisa lag rahaa he ki uttarakhand main bhaajapa ko sarkaar banane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Rawat said that these reports had raised serious doubts in the mind of the undersigned (rawat) that the bjp-led central government would cheat the Constitution again by removing President's rule and then giving the BJP a chance to form the government
 unhone kaha ki vaise bhi vidhansabha main sabase bade dal kaa netaa hone ke baavjood agar mujhe sadan main bahumat siddh karne kaa mauka die bina meri bajaay bhaajapa ko sarkaar banane dene kaa koi bhi prayaas esaaar bommai banaam bharat sarkaar ke maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara sthapit kanoon ke bhi khilaaf hoga
 Rawat said that when a Chief Minister has been deposed using Article 356, only the former Chief Minister should be invited first if he is removed and he should be asked to prove his majority in the Assembly
 is sandarbh main ravat ne uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay main raashtrapati shashan lagu kiye jane ko di gai chunauti kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki us par antim sunwaayee philhal chal rahi he
 Referring to the developments in the state after the last March 18, including the Governor ordering him to prove majority in the House by March 28 and the imposition of President's rule a day before the proposed power test, the former Chief Minister said that he would like to repeat this They still have the required majority in the assembly and should be given a chance to get a confidence vote in the house
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main kahana chahta hum ki mere paas jaruri bahumat he or mujhe sadan main apni takat siddh karne kaa mauka diya janaa chahie
 i am always ready and willing for this
 ’’ gyaapan par harish ravat ke saath hi purv sansadeey kaarymantri indira hridayesh, purv grih mantri preetam singh, purv vanmantri dinesh agarwal or vidhayak mamata rakesh ke bhi hastakshar hai 
 Significantly, on March 18, the bjp's demand for division of votes on the appropriation bill in the Assembly was supported by nine Congress mlas, after which a political storm arose in the state and culminated in the President's rule on 27 March

 Fever and heat wave continues in Bihar
 rajya main ab tak 150 se zyada logon kii maut ho chuki he or ye aankada badhata hi ja rahaa he
 So far 39 people have died due to heat stroke in Gaya alone
 sabase zyada mautein yahaan ke anugrah narayan magadh medical college main hui he
 It is the largest hospital in the district, which has the responsibility of thousands of millions of patients from the entire Magadha Mandal
 sirf gaya hi nahin balki jharkhand ke chatra jaise ilaakon se bhi marij yahaan ilaaj karaane aate hai
 Loo patients are brought to this hospital for treatment
 logon ko ilaaj dene vaala gaya kaa magadh medical college kitna swasth he iskaa andaja aap yahaan kii tasveeron ko dekhakar laga sakate hai
 Santosh Kumar, the manager of the hospital, says that if it rains a little, the whole area gets flooded
 kai saal or maheenon se prashasan ko is bare main likhte rahe hai lekin chitthiyaan kahaan gayi koi nahin jaanata
 This hospital has only two emergency wards
 bed ke naam par do kamaron main 20 bed bhi nahin hai
 The corridor of the hospital, which is commonly used for commuting, has also been converted into an emergency ward
 aspataal prashasan kahata he har kisi ko bed miltaa he
 'animals in OPD' Before going to the ward, it is common for animals to roam around in OPD
 haalanki aspataal prabandhak santosh kumaar kehete hai ki sab kuch thik he
 a female ward designed to treat women is nothing short of a bungalow in appearance
 isaki sthiti itani badahaal he ki yahaan marij nahin maanon kaidiyon ko rakhaa jaataa he
 Roof walls are crumbling
 barsaat main chat se jharnaa bahata he
 The story of the plight is not limited here
 gaya ke sabase bade sarkari aspataal main mahilaon ke liye shauchalay hi nahin he
 The toilets built outside the women's ward are blocked due to the jam
 baahar saarvajanik shauchalay kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 There is also a bad condition of cleanliness here
 yahaan ke security guard ke mutabik sara kachra marijon ke parivaar kaa he jo jahaan tahaan phenk dete hai
 Santosh Kumar says that cleaning is done everyday but the family members of the patients do not listen and spread the dirt
 apni jimmedaari kaa thikra marijon or unke parivaar ke saath chhodkar aspataal prashasan ne apni jimmedaari se peechha chhudaa liya
 In Gaya, 39 people died due to heat stroke
 yahaan aspataal ke kamaron main air condishan to chhod den cooler bhi nahin hai
 The family of a patient even said that the fans here also stop
 jo bada pankhaa laga he usase hawa itani nahin ki marijon ko aaraam mil sake
 a notice board has been installed outside the ward, claiming that from Sunday to Saturday, every bed sheet in the ward will be changed, whose color will be different
 marij ke parijanon ke mutabik yahaan kai dinon tak chadar nahin badali jaati
 On the other hand, Santosh Kumar says that the washing machine in the hospital has been closed for a few weeks
 jaldi hi use thik karvaa lenge
 There is also a shortage of doctors
 This hospital needs 330 doctors, but 230 doctors are currently working
 yahaan 370 nurson kii jarurat he, lekin 250 kaam kar rahi hai
 Despite the lack of facilities, doctors are doing their duty here, but the government, which does not understand the importance of health services, cares about how much it cares for its people
 ipel (indian premier lig) main yajuvendra chahal or parvej rasul kii aguwai kar chuke team india ke captain viraat kohli ne kaha ki england ke khilaaf guuruuvaar se shuru hone vaali teen tii20 maichon kii siries main in donon spinneron ke paas sabase chote formet kaa visheshgy gendbaaj banane kaa sunaharaa mauka rahegaa
 The rest given to Ashwin, Jadeja, Ashwarvichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have been rested from the T20 series and hence the spin department will be responsible for young bowlers like Chahal and Rasool
 kohli ne is bare main kaha ki in gendbaajon ko ipel main khilne kaa acha anubhav he jo yahaan bhi kaam aayega
 Kohli, who joined the team on the basis of IPL, domestic T20, said on the eve of the match, 'the players who have been included in the team have done well in IPL and domestic T20
 ve kifayati rahe hai or sahi kshetra main gendbaaji karte hai
 He is yet to get a chance to play in the big series and so it will be a good chance for him to cement his place as a T20 specialist
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘chahal kaa pradarshan har kisi ne dekha he or rasul bhi aaarasibi main meri captaini main khel chukaa he isliye main jaanata hum ki vah kis tarah kii gendbaaji karata he
 'kohli praised Rasul, Chahal's fiercely, said,' He (rasool) is full of confidence
 vah duniya ke sabase aakraamak ballebaaj ke saamne bhi nai gend se gendbaaji kar saktaa he
 These two (rasool and Chahal) bowl very sensibly
 ve kuch genden khaali daalkar dabaav bana sakate hai or isse aapako wicket milte hai
 This is a very important series for both of them and they have this golden opportunity to make a place in the Indian team as T20 experts
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah siries kai khilaadiyon ke liye phir se form main lautne yaa team main apana sthaan pakkaa karne ke liye shandaar mauka he
 So everyone is included in this team because we believe in them, we trust them
 ve bhavishya main bhi yogadan de sakate hai
 Ultimately it depends on a player how ready he is and how desperate he is to take advantage of the opportunity
 ’best team combination kii talash jarikohli ne iske saath hi spasht kiya ki team combination main bahut adhik badlaav kii sambhaavna nahin he or saath hi joda ki vah bhi pari kaa aagaaj kar sakate hai jaise ki vah ipel main aaarasibi kii taraf se bhi kar chuke hai
 He said, 'it is easy now (to prepare a combination)
 samasya tab aati he jabaki nirantarata kaa abhaav ho
 We will be able to find the best combination only after a few matches
 pehle match main aapke paas ek tay line ap hogi lekin agar ballebaaji kram main nirantarata masalaa banataa he to phir yah mushkil hoti he ki aap us khilaadi ko team main banaae rakhana chaahate hai yaa nahin
 'opening can captain Kohli said about opening,' There are all kinds of possibilities
 ipel main aapke paas zyada bhartiya ballebaaj nahin hote hai kyonki ve kai frenchiji tiimon se jude rahete hai
 As far as Indian batsmen are concerned, here you have a lot of options
 agar jarurat padi to main pari kaa aagaaj kar saktaa hum
 It depends on the balance of the team

 The era when printing literature was considered cool
 us daur main ravindra kaaliya ne hindi patrika jagat main nai jaan foonkane kaa kaam kiya or ve hindi sahitya ke super sampadak ban baithe
 He had got his iron stamp from Dharmayuga magazine
 phir unhone vagarth kii kismat ko bhi badla or us patrika ko logon ke haathon tak pahunchaa diya
 Then when he knocked in the literary scene of Delhi and the editor of New Gyanodaya came to Delhi, everyone felt that this is a normal literary phenomenon
 lekin ye kayaas galat the
 He gave wings to the new Gyanodaya and gave hit points one by one
 na sirf patrika kii rich ko badhaayaa balki patrika nikaalane ke kaam ko dilachasp karm main tabdeel kar diya
 He has proved that he understands the market as well as the interest of the people of literature
 hit ankon ke isi daur main sabase krantikari pal tab aayaa jab nayaa gyanoday kaa 2009 main prem visheshank aayaa
 Its marks created an uproar in Hindi literature and created a stir in Hindi literature
 jisane unhen kai dost die to kai shatru bhi paidaa kar die
 Then the infidelity issue created such a ruckus that there was a panic in the literature
 ve apane antim dinon main bhi vartmaan sahitya ke salaahkaar sampadak rahe
 Those conversations on the telephone in 2009 were getting hit points of his love that i saw that some translated stories appeared in one issue
 dekha to ye kahaniyaan mere dwaara anudit kitaab uskaa premi se lee gai thim
 This book was published by Samvad Publication
 in kahaniyon main na to mujhe credit diya gaya tha or na hi samvaad prakaashan kaa hi koi zikr tha
 Shocked me
 maine sochaarvindra kaaliyajaise shaks aisa kaise kar sakate hai
 i thought and thought a lot, then finally he turned the phone around
 duusari taraf ravindra kaaliya the
 i got to talk to one of my favorite authors for the first time and that too seemed too bad for such an issue
 lekin main is anyaay ko bhi kaise jhel saktaa tha
 So, when i told them, they immediately came to me
 unhone mujhe aashwaasan diya ki ve is galati ko ve dur kar denge or unase unke sahitya par bhi baat hui
 i liked the conversation full of vivacity
 aashwaasan mere liye kaaphi tha
 i knew that they would not necessarily do something like this
 lekin main us samay hairat main rah gaya jab unhone agle hi ank main meri baat rakhi or un kahaniyon kaa credit mujhe diya
 i felt very good
 maine turant unhen kol kii or shukriya kaha
 He said, "oh man, thank you, what a mistake we made, we rectified it
" ' yahi nahin, kuch din baad kahaniyon ke liye unki ore se maniorder bhi aa gaya
 On Saturday, he breathed his last at Gangaram Hospital in Delhi
 unhen liver main takalif thi, jis vajah se vahaan bharti karaayaa gaya tha
 He was born on 11 November 1939 in Jalandhar
 ranj to unase na milane kaa he, or gaalib kaa yah sher jehan main kaundhta he
 It was not our luck that visal-e-yaar would have happened, and it would have been waiting for us to live

 Abdullah Azam defeated BJP candidate Lakshmi Saini by more than 50,000 votes, while Nawab Kazim Ali of BSP stood third
 bataa den ki nawab kazim ali is seat se lagaataar teen baar congress ke tikat par vidhayak bane hai
 He won from Swar on a Congress ticket in 2002, 2007 and 2012, but in 2017, when he contested on the BSP ticket, Abdullah Azam defeated him by a record number of votes
 abdulla ajam ne jeet to darj kar lee, lekin nawab kazim ali ne unke khilaaf shikaayat kar di
 Kazim Ali alleged that fake documents were given to give more age, on the basis of which the election was contested
 bataa den ki chunaav ladane ke liye 25 saal umr kii seemaa he or aarope he ki chunaav ladane ke vakt abdulla kii umr thi, lekin unhone farji dastavej ke aadhaar par chunaav ladaa

 darasal do din ke chhattisgarh daure par aae bharti bilaspur ke chhattisgarh bhawan ke viipi room main tehre the
 Bharti felt midnight that his hands and legs were a bitch
 somnath bharti ne jab ankhen kholi to unhen apane aasapaas koi najar nahin aayaa, lekin phir jaise hi dobaaraa unki neend lagi, vaise hi phir kisi ne unke sharir ko kutarna shuru kar diya
 Bharti was upset all night
 unhone party ke kaaryakartaaon ko bulaane kii koshish kii, lekin kaaphi raat ho jane se kaaryakarta bhi so chuke the
 So he did not think it appropriate to call anyone
 bharti aakhirkar sari raat jaagate rahe
 But in the morning he came to know the real reason behind this incident that there were many rats in his guest room
 unhone fouran party kaaryakartao ko bulaayaa or chuhon ko dhar-dabochne kaa abhiyaan ched diya
 Somnath Bharti is said to have been attacked by more than half a dozen rats in the night
 chuuhe unki davaaiyaan bhi kha gaye
 After a lot of hard work, the AAP workers managed to catch just one mouse
 iske baad bharti ne bijepi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi khud to unka saamana nahin kar paa rahi he
 Therefore, they are being attacked by rats
 udhar chuhon se pareshaan bharti kaa haal behaal hote dekh bijepi ne aaropon ko lekar tanj ksaa he
 BJP said that this is the condition of those who betray the public, they are not left even by rats
 bataa den ki chhattisgarh main aap ne jor-shor ke saath chunavi abhiyaan chhedaa he
 The party has fielded candidates in all 90 assembly seats in the state

 Actually, according to the data released by ML Sharma, Chairperson of JEE Advanced, like every year, many students have qualified JEE Advanced this year, but while it is mandatory to take the JEE Advanced exam for admission to IIT, JEE Main Exam Students who passed did not register for the JEE Advanced exam
 aapako bataa den, saal 2019 main, 11
 Out of 47 lakh JEE Main candidates, 2
 45 lakh chaatro ne jeii advance ke liye kwalifai kiya, lekin keval 1
 Only 73 lakh have registered for this examination
 vahiin 2018 main, 2
 31 lakh students were compulsory for the JEE Advanced exam
 jinamein se 1
 65 lakh candidates had registered for this examination
 aise main aankadon ke mutabik jeii advance kii pariksha main lagaataar duusare saal chaatro ne ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 Let me tell you, the second stage of JEE Advanced Exam for admission to iits
 kyonki jeii main ke ke score (neshnal testing agency dwaara sanchalit) ke aadhaar par hi kuch chuninda chaatro ko is pariksha ko dene kaa mauka miltaa he
 According to the report of registrationindian Express, why students are not doing JEE Advanced exam, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kanpur, head of IIITM Gwalior, talking to Indian engineer and academician Sanjay Govind Dhande told that IIT students and parents for engineering Is the first choice
 lekin sabhi iaiti ke pakshdhar nahin hai
 With this, now many students are not willing to go to IIT
 ve iaiti kii tulana main rashtriya praudyogiki santhaan (enaiti) kaa chayan karnaa chaahate hai
 These days, aspiring engineering aspirants are also eager to do other things like internship etc
 sanjay govind dhande ne aage kaha ki chaatro par jeii main kii pariksha dene kaa dabaav hota he kyonki yah unke liye pariksha kai daravaaje khol sakati he
 But most of the students do not choose this exam for b
tech degree
 ve aksar jeii main ko analytics-aadhaarit vishyon kii tulana main adhik rachanaatmak ke liye chunate hai, jisamen jeii main score ke aadhaar par iiits dwaara pradaan kiye gaye dizin aadi kaarykram shaamil ho sakate hai
 Topper is not IIT first choice Dhruv Arora, who secured third rank in JEE Main examination, told Indian Express that IIT is not his first choice
 indore ke rahane vaale, 17 saal ke vishaal ne jeii main janvari satr kii pariksha main 100 percetyle hasil kiya tha unhone bataaya ki “main jeii advance kii pariksha dene vaala hum, lekin maine keval iaiti ke liye jane kaa faisla nahin kiya he
 He told that his favorite subject is Physics
 vah aage theorical physics padhanaa chaahate hai
 So, i am thinking about getting admission in Indian Institute of Science (iisc), Bangalore in future
 acadmic corseje ke dean jagadish kumaar ne bataaya ki iaiti madras vartmaan main sheersh ranking vaale iaiti hai, lekin chaatr iaiti chhodkar aasapaas ke kshetron main enaiti jaise sansthaanon ko praathamikta de sakate hai
 At the same time, he said, "if a student has secured 2000 rank in JEE Main exam, then whatever program he / she wants will get in NIT, but if they appear in JEE Advanced and clear, then they will be in IIT of their choice
 There may be trouble in getting your preferred course

 pradhan nyaayadhish ne bhi saamne ai yachika par vichaar karne kaa faisla kiya or raat ko supreme court khulwaaya gaya

 The convict Surender Koli of the Nithari murder case was to be hanged in Meerut jail
 aap jaanate hi hai ki 2006 main jab nithari hatyakand kaa raaj saamne aayaa tha tab kaise sara samaaj hill gaya tha
 How come people were filled with anger as soon as Surendra Koli was mentioned

 Reached Dattu Saheb's house
 raat kii us ghadi main bhi pradhan nyaayadhish ne faansee par roak laga di
 The media did not know about it till morning
 baad main elahabaad hoicourt ne surendra coli kii faansee ko umr kaid main badal diya
 So lawyers like Indira Jaising awake not just for Yakub Memon but also for Surendra Koli
 kai logon ne poocha he ki ye log kisi garib ke liye kya raat ko jaayenge
 The right question is but will the same question be asked to those lawyers who become spokespersons, ministers and hold constitutional posts in the party
 pataa karnaa chahie ki aise vakeelon ne kitne garibon kaa cese ladaa or kitne karporate kaa
 Advocates like Vrinda Grover and Prashant Bhushan also oppose the hanging of former minister Maya Kodnani, accused of killing dozens of people in the Gujarat riots
 2012 main supreme court or hai court ke 14 ritred jajon ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko likhaa tha ki paanch maamalon main 9 logon kii faansee kii sazaa ko umr kaid main badal diya jaae
 Obviously, the weak have been fought for before
 yah kahana puri tarah se galat he ki faansee kaa virodh abhi ho rahaa he
 If there is a protest against the execution, then why are the responsibilities of two or four lawyers
 raajnneetik dal apni line kyon nahin saaf karte

 Shashi Tharoor said that 'I am sad that our government has hanged a human being
 rajya pryojit hatya ham sabko bhi hatyare main badal detii he
 i am not commenting on the merit of a case, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court
 samasya he faansee ko lekar
 We must fight terrorism but this kind of killing has not stopped terrorism anywhere
 ' The Congress could move forward with the line of Shashi Tharoor, but the party knows that the leaders of the Tharoor type do not fit into the politics of collective consciousness
 landan main wo koi baat kah de to pradhanmantri ko bhi janch jaati he magar bharat main hawa ke khilaaf bol den to sab daaen baayen dekhne lagate hai
 Congress Party spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said that hanging has been part of the penal law in the country for 67 years
 ye reerest of rer cese main hi di jaati he
 The party cannot talk of any change in it
 agar puri sansad chaahe to is par vichaar kar sakati he
 As long as it is part of the penal legislation, it should be fully compliant
 to congress apni raay tabhi bataaegi jab sansad apni raay bataaegi
 You can tell that without the opinion of the parties, can the Parliament give its opinion first
 shashi tharur ke bayaan se duuri banane kii uski majaburi kya us tathakthith samuhik chetana ke kaaran thi
 This collective consciousness should also be understood properly
 yah sahi he ki faansee kaa samarthan karne waalon kii taadaad kam nahin he lekin yah bhi sahi he ki unka laabh uthaakar unmaad failaane vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 In my opinion, three types of sections are active in support of capital punishment
 ek tabaka faansee kii sazaa kaa samarthak rahaa he to ek aisa tabaka bhi rahaa jiskaa faansee se to virodh he magar aatankwaad jaise maamalon main faansee kaa samarthan he
 a third section took advantage of these two sections
 is tabake main shaamil log faansee ke samarthakon ke bahaane apni raajnneeti ke liye jagah banane lage hai, aisa karne vaale kai dalon main or donon samudaay ke log hai
 When Afzal Guru was hanged, the CPM mouthpiece People's Democracy wrote that Afzal's hanging would increase separatism in Kashmir
 jabaki seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki kanoon ne apana kaam kiya
 The case which had been stuck for 11 years came to an end
 ek tarah se yah sammaan or swaagat hi tha lekin is baar sipiem shuru se hi faansee ke khilaaf bol rahi thi
 Sitaram Yechury said that our party believes that there should be no punishment for hanging
 ham chaahate hai ki isamen badlaav ho, umraqaid kii paribhaasha badale

 But as soon as the news came that the proposal against the hanging of Afzal Guru could be passed in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, the collective consciousness immediately started dancing all over North India

 Congress state president Captain Amarinder Singh also opposed the hanging and the Akali Dal did it
 bijepi ne kabhi apni line nahin badali magar kabhi apana dost nahin badla
 The BJP still supports hanging but also gives the opposition a place in its government
 balavant singh rajoana jis aatankwaadi hamale main doshi paye gaye the usamen mukhyamantri sahit 17 log maare gaye the
 At that time Rajoana also wrote a letter that i do not need any help from the Akali Dal leaders
 inhone sikhon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 History will never forgive the Akali Dal
 phir bhi akali dal ne samarthan kiya or faansee kii sazaa umr kaid main badali
 Today we are with the Akali Dal, Congress, BJP and CPM leaders with whom we will talk if they have the courage to protest against the execution of the frenzy like a few lawyers
 zaahir si baat he ki unki haalia smriti main aisi koi ghatana hui bhi nahin thi ki raashtrapati ke dayaa yachika khaarij karne ke baad aadhi raat ko prashanth bhushan, anand grover, vrinda grover, yugamohit choudhary jaise vakil vahaan se bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise ech

 But there is another incident that can be missed in this context
 nithari hatyakand ke mujrim surendra coli ko meerut kii jail main faansee honi thi
 You know how the whole society was shaken when the secret of Nithari murder was revealed in 2006
 surendra coli kaa zikr aate hi kis tarah log rosh se bhar jate the
 Surendra Koli was to be hanged in Meerut jail on the morning of 8 September
 mashhoor vakil indira jaisingh raat dedh baje pradhan nyaayadhish ech
 L
 dattu sahab ke ghar pahunch gai
 Even at that hour of night, the Chief Justice banned the hanging
 media ko subah tak isaki bhanak nahin lagi
 Later the Allahabad High Court converted the hanging of Surendra Koli to life imprisonment
 to indira jaisingh jaise vakil sirf yaqub memon ke liye hi nahin balki surendra coli jaison ke liye bhi jaagate hai
 Many people have asked whether these people will go for any poor night
 sahi sawaal he lekin kya yahi sawaal un vakeelon se kiya jayega jo party main pravaktaa, mantri banate hai or sanvaidhanik pad hasil karte hai
 It should be known that how many such lawyers fought the case of the poor and how many corporate
 vrinda grover or prashanth bhushan jaise vakil gujarat dangon main darjanon logon kii hatya kii aaropee purv mantri maaya kodenani ko faansee dene kii baat kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 In 2012, 14 retired judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court wrote to President Pranab Mukherjee that the death sentence of 9 people in five cases should be commuted to life imprisonment
 zaahir he kamazor ke liye pehle bhi ladaa jaataa rahaa he
 It is completely wrong to say that there is a protest against the hanging
 faansee kaa virodh hona he to yah jimmaa do chaar vakeelon ke kandhe par kyon hai
 Why don't political parties clear their line
 kya hamaari raajnneeti tathakthith samuhik chetana se ghabraati he
 We should understand that the leaders and parties are under pressure and fear of strong public opinion, perhaps even Shashi Tharoor may have stayed but his tweet right after hanging is no less adventurous
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki 'dukhi hum ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko lataka diya he
 State sponsored murder turns all of us into murderers too
 main kisi cese kii merit par tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum, use supreme court ko tay karnaa he
 The problem is with the hanging
 ham aatankwaad se zarur laden lekin is tarah kii hatya se kahin bhi aatankwaad nahin rukaa he
 ' congress shashi tharur kii line ke sahare aage bad sakati thi magar party jaanati he samuhik chetana kii raajnneeti main tharur tip ke netaa feet nahin baithte
 If he says something in London, the Prime Minister is also shocked, but in India, if he speaks against the wind, then everyone starts looking left and right
 congress party ke pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki 67 saal se desh main faansee dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he
 It is given only in the rarest of rare cases
 isamen badlaav kii koi baat party nahin kar sakati
 If the whole parliament wants it can consider it
 jab tak ye dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he iskaa puri tarah se anupaalan hona chahie
 So the Congress will express its opinion only when the Parliament gives its opinion
 aap bataaiye ki bina partiyon kii raay ke kya sansad apni raay pehle bataa sakati he
 Was his compulsion to distance himself from Shashi Tharoor's statement because of that so-called collective consciousness
 is samuhik chetana ko bhi thik se samajhnaa chahie
 It is true that the number of those who supported the hanging is not small, but it is also true that by taking advantage of them, those who spread the hysteria are not less
 meri raay main teen tarah kaa tabaka faansee kii sazaa ke samarthan main sakriy he
 One section has been a supporter of the execution of the sentence, while there has been a section which is opposed to the hanging but there is support for hanging in cases like terrorism
 in donon tabake kaa laabh ek tisare tabake ne uthaaya
 People in this section have started making space for their politics under the pretext of hanging supporters, many parties and people of both communities doing so
 jab afzal guru ko faansee hui thi tab sipiem ke mukhpatr pipuls demokrasi ne likhaa tha ki afazal kii faansee se kashmir main algaavvaad or badhegaa
 Whereas Sitaram Yechury said that the law did its job
 jo maamla 11 saal se atka tha uskaa ant hua
 In a way it was an honor and a welcome, but this time the CPM was speaking against the execution from the beginning
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki hamaari party maanati he ki faansee kii sazaa nahin honi chahie
 We want it to change, change the definition of life
 
 
 
 Life imprisonment should mean jail till the last day of life
 
 
 abhi umraqaid main keval 14 saal hi jail kii sazaa hoti he
 CPI MP in Rajya Sabha d

 raja kaa kahana he ki aankh ke liye aankh kaa kanoon bharat main nahin ho saktaa he
 When the Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a unanimous resolution against the hanging of Rajiv Gandhi's killers and released them, our collective consciousness could not reach Chennai due to being in North India
 lekin jaise hi khabar ai ki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main afazal guru kii faansee ke kilaaf prastaav paas ho saktaa he to turant samuhik chetana puure uttar bharat main naachne lagi
 The proposal did not pass there, but when there was protest against the hanging of Rajoana in Punjab, the collective consciousness went to Shimla from Kalka Mail to celebrate the holiday
 tippaniyan In March 2012, Akali Dal called for a Punjab bandh to protest against the hanging of Balwant Singh Rajoana
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh captain amarinder singh ne bhi faansee kaa virodh kiya or akali dal ne to kiya hi
 BJP never changed its line but never changed its friend
 bijepi aaj bhi faansee kaa samarthan karti he magar virodh karne vaale ko apni sarkaar main jagah bhi detii he
 In the terrorist attack in which Balwant Singh Rajoana was convicted, 17 people including the Chief Minister were killed
 us vakt rajoana ne ek patr bhi likhaa tha ki mujhe akali dal ke netao se koi madad nahin chahie
 They have done nothing to bring justice to the Sikhs
 itihaas akali dal ko kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Nevertheless, the Akali Dal supported and the death sentence was hanged
 aaj ham akali dal, congress, bijepi or sipiem netaaon ke saath hai jinase baat karenge ki kya unamem saahas he ki ve un chand vakeelon kii tarah unmaad kaa shikaar hote hue bhi faansee kaa virodh kar sakate hai
