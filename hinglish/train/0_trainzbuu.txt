 The Supreme Court has delivered a historic verdict in the case of Balram Prasad vs
 Kunal Saha
 isamen sheersh adaalat ne peedit kunal saaha ko 6 karod rupee 8 lakh rupee kaa muaavja dilaa chukaa he
 The Supreme Court had said in its judgment that the doctors were negligent in treating Kunal Saha's wife Anuradha Saha, which led to her death

e
 IPC
 in dhaaraon ke tahat doctor ko chah maheene se lekar do saal tak kii sajaa or jurmaana donon ho sakate hai
 In the case of the doctor's negligence, advocate Kalika Prasad Kala 'manas' says that it is the legal duty of the doctor to treat the patient with full caution and vigilance
 agar doctor ilaaj main laaparvaahee karata he, to us (doctor) par criminal or civil donon tarah kii libility banati he

 Advocate Kala says that if the patient dies due to doctor's negligence in treatment, a case can be filed under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code
 agar court doctor ko ilaaj main laaparvaahee kaa doshi paata he, to usko do saal tak kii sajaa or jurmaana donon ho saktaa he

 Advocate Kala says that in such a case, the court decides compensation on the basis of age, education and earnings of the deceased patient
 kaise jaane ki doctor ne ilaaj main laaparvaahee barti yaa nahinedwocket kalika prasad kaala kaa kahana he ki marij ke care karne kii doctor kii legal duty he
 If the doctor did not perform the duty of caring for the patient, he would be held guilty of negligence in treatment
 doctor ne apni duty ko nibhaayaa yaa nahin, isko teen point se samajha ja saktaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 1
 Is the patient able to treat the patient whom the doctor has recruited for treatment? Does it mean that the doctor has the professional skill to treat that patient or not? If he does not have a professional skill and has admitted a patient for money or with any other intention, the doctor will be held responsible for negligence in treatment
 2
 Is the doctor treated according to the patient's illness or not? Meaning if the patient has TB, then the doctor should be given TB medicine only
 vah tibi ke marij ko cancer kii nahin de saktaa he
 If he does this, then he will be considered to be negligent in treatment
 3
 Is the doctor treating the patient with complete honesty and caution? If the doctor did not treat the patient with full caution, he would be held responsible for negligence in treatment

 haalanki suraksha agenciyaan teenon kii is baat par bahut vishwaas nahin kar rahi hai

 He said that Shah Rukh and Hrithik are very popular in Kargalilik of Xianjang province

 However, in the midst of all this, everyone is dependent on the Governor of whom they invite first to form the government

 Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap says that it is entirely up to the governor to whom he invites to form the government first
 sabase badi party ko, yaa gathbandhan sarkaar ko
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 104 seats in the results of the Karnataka Assembly elections on Tuesday, while the Congress won 78 and the JDS 37
 iske alaava bahujan samaaj party or karnataka prajaiyavantha janata party ko kramshah 1-1 siten mili hai
 Apart from these, one seat has also come in the other part

 'congress's desperation to support JDS' BJP spokesperson Shantaram said that supporting the Janata Dal (secular) to form a coalition government is a 'frustration for the defeated Congress'
 shantaram ne kaha ki unki party ke paas jedies se gathbandhan kaa yaa nai sarkaar banane ke liye iskaa samarthan lene kaa vikalp khulaa he

 " guuruuvaar se puure desh main lagu sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii safalataa main sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika media ko nibhaana hoga
 Media and law experts expressed the opinion that the Central Government has provided free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to 14 years in the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan implemented from Thursday, but the media will play an important role in the success of this campaign
 paradkar bhawan main ‘sarv shiksha abhiyaan main media kii bhoomika’ vishay par yojit rashtriya sangoshtee main vaktaaon ne kaha ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ko safal banane main media kii ahm bhoomika hogi
 Experts said that if the media will fully play its role in making people aware of this law, then its benefits can be easily extended to the common people

 He said that the main reason for this is lack of strong will in government and corrupt bureaucracy
 isi ke kaaran is abhiyaan ke liye lagaataar avadhi or kharch raashi hi badhati rahi lekin abhiyaan safalataa se koson dur rah gaya
 Local editor of daily newspaper 'amar Ujala', Arrow Vijay Singh said that since 1990, again Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan became a major issue of the government
 san 2001 se 2010 tak kharbon rupaye kharch karke bhi is abhiyaan ke mukhya uddeshy ko bharat sarkaar hasil nahin kar saki he balki hameshaa kii tarah is lakshya ko hasil karne kii avadhi 2017 tak badha di gai
 Now it has become necessary for the government to rein in the bureaucracy to make this campaign successful only then this campaign can be successful
 is disha main media kii bhoomika bhi ati mahatvapurn he
 If the media continues to scrutinize governmental action keeping an eye on the objectives of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and will work to make the public aware of its rights, then this campaign can get success soon
 centre main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ke chaar saal puure ho chuke hai or BJP iskaa jashn manaane main juty hui he
 Modi has spoken to his ministers to count the work done by the government in these four years in public
 PM modi 2014 ke chunaavon ke dauraan kiye vaade puure karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 But there are some issues where even after 4 years, the Modi government is seen on the backfoot
 ekataraf to BJP ke tathakthith rashtravaadi bhakt modi raaj main akhand bharat kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, or kahaan bharat ke andar hi savarnon or daliton ke bich is dauraan khai or bad gai prathit ho rahi he
 During the last four years, incidents of Dalit oppression have occurred one after the other, which exposed the Modi government's claim of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 har 15 minute main ek dalit ho rahaa utpeedan kaa shikarasbase pehle to sarkari aankadon par hi najar daal lete hai
 If the latest figures of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) are true, then there has been a rapid increase in the cases of anti-dalit violence in the last four years
 2006 main daliton ke viruddh aparaadhon ke kul 27, 070 maamle saamne aae the jo 2011 main badhkar 33,719 ho gaye
 In 2014, 40,401 cases of crimes were registered with SC, 38670 cases in 2015 and 40,801 cases in 2016
 aankadon ke mutabik, is dauraan hindustan main har 15 minute main kisi na kisi dalit ke saath koi na koi aapraadhik ghatana ghati
 Dalits are the most oppressed in BJP ruled states
 The shocking thing that has come out of NCRB figures is that in the last four years, the states in which the Dalits have been the most oppressed in the country are either BJP government or BJP coalition government
 baat karen dalit utpeedan main sabase aage rahe rajyon kii to madhya pradesh dalit utpeedan main sabase aage rahaa
 In 2014, 3,294 cases of Dalit oppression were registered in MP, the number of which increased to 3,546 in 2015 and 4,922 in 2016
 desh main daliton par hue aapraadhik maamalon main se 12
 1 per cent cases were reduced in MP alone
 daliton par atyaachaar ke maamle main BJP shasit rajasthan duusare sthaan par rahaa
 However, there is definitely a decrease in cases of harassment here
 rajasthan main 2014 main dalit utpeedan ke 6,735 maamle, 2015 main 5,911 maamle va 2016 main 5,136 maamle darj hue
 After this, Bihar was the third in the case of Dalit oppression, where the BJP and JDU have a partnership government
 bihar main 2016 main anusuchit jati ke logon par atyaachaar ke 5,701 maamle darj hue
 Gujarat was at number four most surprising
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ne jis rajya ko desh ke saamne model state kii tarah pesh kiya, vahaan daliton kii sthiti chintajanak he
 According to NCRB data, 1,094 cases of Dalit oppression were registered in Gujarat, 1,010 cases in 2015 and 1,322 in 2016
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, 2016 main anusuchit jati par hamalon kaa rashtriya ausat jahaan 20
 4 percent was there whereas Gujarat's share was 32
 5 pratishat rahaa
 Yogi's UP came out in the forefront of Dalit oppression, in fact it is a figure in which no state would want to come forward
 puure desh main beete chaar varshon ke dauraan dalit utpeedan ke maamalon main to badhotaree dekhi hi gai, uttar pradesh is maamle main kuch zyada hi aage niklaa
 In fact, in 2016, UP came out on top in the country in terms of Dalit oppression
 saal 2016 main anusuchit jati par hamalon ke maamle main upi (10,426) sheersh par rahaa
 There were 1065 cases of rape of Dalit women, of which 88 incidents took place in Lucknow alone
 usamen bhi 43 ghatnaayen striyon se dushkarm kii raheen
 Sensing an atmosphere of widespread displeasure of the downtrodden community, the dalit community's food is not working, the Modi government has started a campaign to dine the dalits with the aim of wooing the dalits
 daliton ko rijhaane ke liye bhaajapa ne gram swaraj abhiyaan kaa sahaara liya
 In this campaign, which lasted from 14 April to 5 May, the ministers and leaders of the BJP government reached the remote village to find the pulse of the Dalits, put a chaupal in the night, but the exercise of eating food with the Lashkar at the house of Dalits only gave rise to controversies
 ab chaahe bihar ke begusarai main kendriya mantri eses ahaluwalia kaa baahar se khaanaa mangakar dalit ke ghar khaane kaa maamla ho, chaahe upi sarkaar ke hi ganna vikaas mantri suresh rana dwaara dalit parivaar ke yahaan halwaiyon ke haath kaa bana paalak paneer, makhni daal, chhola, raita, tandoor, coffee, rasagulla or mineral water kaa lutf uthaanaa
 Modi's ministers were doing food politics in the house of Dalits, but many times their vile statements made the game upside down
 yogi sarkaar main mantri anupama jaiswal ne jahaan daliton ke ghar raatbhar machhar kaatane kii baat uthaai, vahiin yogi sarkaar main hi ek anya mantri rajendra pratap ne khud kii tulana bhagwaan ram ke saath karte hue kaha diya ki ram ne bhi shabari ke juthe ber khaae the
 Even in the Modi government, Minister Savitri Bai Phule even called the politics of food for Dalits home an insult to Dalits
 aarakshan par aadhikarik tantra kuch to prachaar tantra kuchhdaliton ko lekar modi sarkaar chaahe jitne daawey kar le, lekin vah desh ke dalit samudaay kaa purna vishwaas ab tak hasil nahin kar pai he
 Actually, it is not only the difference between words and actions, but social media also has a big role in influencing the new politics of the country
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav se lekar karnataka vidhansabha chunaav tak samay samay par vipakshi dal modi sarkaar dwaara daliton or anya pichhadaa varg ko milane vaala aarakshan khatm kiye jane kaa dar dikhaate rahe hai
 In fact, Dalits also see some truth in this claim of the opposition, because such things have been continuously arising on social media, in which reservation has been displayed as the great evil of backwardness of the country
 soshal media par viral hone vaale in sandeshon main aarakshan ke bahaane daliton or anya pichde samudaay ko unke bauddhik pichhadepan ke liye nishaanaa banaaya jaataa he
 On the one hand, Prime Minister Modi himself has said many times that no one can abolish reservation from this country, but his publicity system on social media is constantly being seen in creating public opinion against reservation
 ab haal kii hi ek ghatana ko le len, jab pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main ek nirmaanadhin pul kii teen beemen girane se darjan bhar ke kareeb logon kii maut ho gai
 After this, such messages were circulated on social media that 'what a surprise when the bridge under construction in the country where half the engineers are made by reservation'
 supreme court ke faisle se deshbhar ke dalit narajasupreme court ne isi saal 20 march kodalit atroceties actmen bada badlaav karne kaa nirdesh diya
 The Supreme Court said that investigation should be done before filing an FIR under the Dalit Atrocities Act and an FIR should be filed only after the complaint is found to be reasonable in the preliminary inquiry
 supreme court ne saath hi dalit atrocities act main badlaav kii baat bhi kahi
 This order of the Supreme Court was seen as a weakening of the Dalit Atrocities Act
 supreme court ke is faisle ko lekar bhi modi sarkaar kii yah kahkar aalochana kii gai ki sarkaar ne court ke saamne thos tark nahin rakhe, jisase supreme court ne aisa nirdesh sunaaya
 Due to this order of the Supreme Court, the Dalit community erupted across the country and in April a fire of violence erupted in a dozen states
 daliton kaa yah andolan hinsak ho uthaa or kai dinon tak chalaa
 In this movement of Dalits, more than a dozen people died from different parts of the country
 daliton ke is andolan ne modi sarkaar kii chulein hilaa deen
 And finally the central government is now considering repealing the order of the Supreme Court through a mandate
 ambedkar kii murtiyon ban raheen nishanamanipur main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad lenin kii murti kaa todaa janaa apane aap main ek raajnneetik ghatana ban gaya
 The breaking of Lenin's statue, then the coming of the Supreme Court order and the changed politics of the BJP about Ambedkar
 in sabakaa nateeja yah rahaa ki desh ke vibhinn hisson se ambedkar kii pratimaayein tuutane kii khabaren aane lageen
 The upper castes used it as a big political message against the Dalits
 ambedkar kii murtiyon kaa tootna bhi modi sarkaar ke gale kii haddi ban gai
 In order to protect Ambedkar's idol, policemen were either deployed or Ambedkar's idol was secured by locking it in Lohi's net
 dalit utpeedan par prashasan bhi samvedanheenwaise to hameshaa se daliton ke khilaaf utpeedan ko ek saamaajik samasya ke rup main dekha gaya or iske niraakaran ke liye sarkarein paroksh raste apanaati raheen
 But during the last four years, there have been some such incidents, which seem to have gone beyond social stereotypes to form of government oppression
 kyonki adhiktar dalit utpeedan ke maamalon main prashasnic amale kii samvedanheenata nikalakar saamne ai he
 Now, whether it is the decision to not allow the Dalit groom's procession to go out of the upper castes in Kasganj, Uttar Pradesh, or to inform Dalits in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh three days in advance
 desh ke vibhinn hisson se dalit duulhe yaa daliton kii baraat ke saath savarnon kii badasluki ke maamle lagaataar saamne aate rahete hai
 In protest against his own Dalit minister, the Modi government faced the most trouble on the issue of Dalit oppression when many of his own Dalits rose up against the minister
 itawa se bhaajapa ke dalit saansad ashok dohare ne aarope lagaaya ki essi-asti act par supreme court ke faisle kii aad main daliton kaa utpeedan kiya ja rahaa he
 Chhota Lal Kharwar, Member of Parliament from Robertsganj, Yashwant Singh, Member of Parliament from Nagina, has also pointed fingers at the functioning of the BJP Government

 Warren Buffet buys the entire business, buys millions of shares and also invests in companies
 jin companiyon main vah nivesh karte hai ve barkshaayar ke malikana haq vaali bhi ho sakati hai jaise ki bnesaf railway, barkshaayar hathaave energy
 In January, Berkshire 32 from aviation-related construction company precision castparts
 36 billian dollar kii deal kii thi
 It was the largest acquisition in the history of Berkshire
 tab se baffe nakadi rakam ke dher par baithe hue hai joki dinondin teji se badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Investor Andy Kilpatrick says i think he is looking for a great deal while paying the right price
 bataa den, endi ne 'of permanent vailu : da story of warren baffe' naamak kitaab likhi thi
 By the way, make it clear that all the cash that Berkshire has is not all available
 darasal, company ko apane paas kam se kam 20 billian dollar kii rakam rakhni hi he taaki barkshaayar kii insurance companiyaan is paise ko kisi bade clem yaa kisi or jarurat ke samay istemaal kar saken
 Buffett always says that he is always on the lookout for acquisitions of companies that can 'fit' in Berkshire's scale, but for any company he will pay the same price as, according to him, 'that company is worth it'
 
 omaha main uniwarsity of nebraska main finance padhaa rahe jorge morgan ne kaha- yah kahana mushkil he ki vah kya dhund rahe hai, ham sirf itanjar kar sakate hai
 Warren Buffett doesn't talk much about what he's going to buy
 jin companiyon ke saath deal kii baatcheet radd karte hai, unke bare main bhi vah baat nahin karte
 Despite this, its investors are busy speculating about their next purchase
 morgan ko lagata he ki vah mars candi kharid sakate hai yadi ve log ise bechnaa chahen to
 Buffett often cited the example of sneakers candy bars as explaining the theory of sustainable competitive adventure
 kuch niveshkon ko lagata he ki vah apni utility unit kaa vistaar kar sakate hai
 Berkshire 5 in 2013
 6 billian dollar neveda envi energy kharridne main kharche the
 The comments baffe kah chuke hai ki vah 3ji capital ke saath phir se kaam kar sakate hai
 Together, they bought Kraft Foods and Heinz
 lekin yah spasht nahin he ki donon ke bich aisi koi deal aage kab hogi
 Berkshire has not been able to earn more interest than the cash it holds in the environment currently prevailing over interest rates
 lekin baffe par unke share holders kii ore se jald se jald kisi tarah ke adhigrahan karne ko lekar koi dabaav nahin he
 Or there is no pressure to start paying dividends, which Berkshire has never given since taking over in 1965
 do saal pehle barkshaayar ke share holders ne khud hi dividend kaa idia thukraa diya tha
 As it is, Berkshire's share holders know the value of the 'pile of cash', they have seen in the 2008 recession
 2008 kii mandi ke samay baffe ne goldman sex, general electronic, harlee davidson or kai anya ko tagdi byaaj daron par arabon dollar kii vittiya 'madad' kii peshkash kii thi

 niveshak endi kilpatric kaa kahana he ki mujhe lagata he ki vah sahi keemat chukaate hue kisi shandaar (deal) kii talash main he
 Let me tell you, Andy wrote a book called 'of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffet'
 vaise saaf kar den ki barkshaayar ke paas jitna bhi nakadi he, vah sab kaa sab 'avelable' nahin he
 Actually, the company has to keep at least $ 20 billion in its possession so that the insurance companies of Berkshire can use this money in times of any major claim or any other need
 baffe hameshaa kehete hai ki vah barkshaayar ke paimaanon main 'feet' ho sakane vaali companiyon ke adhigrahan ke liye har vakt nigaah rakhe hue hote hai lekin kisi bhi company ke liye vah utani hi keemat chukaayenge jitani ki unke mutabik, 'vah company kaabil he'
 George Morgan, who teaches finance at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said - it's hard to say what he is looking for, we can just wait

 But it is not clear when such a deal will happen between the two
 haal philhal byaaj daron ko lekar jo maahaul kaayam he usamen barkshaayar apane paas ikattha nakadi se zyada byaaj nahin kama paa rahaa
 But Buffett is under no pressure from his share holders to make any acquisition as soon as possible
 yaa phir aisa bhi koi dabaav nahin he ki ve labhaansh dena shuru kar den joki barkshaayar ko 1965 main tech over karne ke baad se kabhi nahin diya gaya he
 Two years ago Berkshire stock holders themselves rejected the idea of dividend
 vaise bhi barkshaayar ke share holder 'cash ke dher' kii vailu jaanate hai, 2008 kii mandi main vah dekh chuke hai
 At the time of the 2008 recession, Buffett had offered financial assistance of billions of dollars to Goldman Sachs, General Electronic, Hurley Davidson and many others at strong interest rates
 vaise jab tak unhen koi badhiya shandaar target nahin mil jaataa or jo karte aa rahe hai, vahi karte rahenge yani ki kabhi kabhaar phone kol le lenaa, zyada bijanas reports padhanaa

 In addition, an amino acid called arginine found in peanuts is effective in maintaining blood pressure

 Then came a time when the two leaders, who became enemies of each other's life, met each other, and now these proximity grew so much that for the first time in history, a US President stepped on the borders of his enemy 70 years old
 ji, puri duniya us vakt hairaan rah gai jab america raashtrapati donald trump ne uttar korea kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Trump took the first step on the same South Korean land, which he had so much enmity with until a few days ago, because of both, the world was facing the threat of nuclear war
 kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki donon ek din itane kareeb aa jaaenge ki trump korea kii dharti par kadam rakhane vaale pehle america raashtrapati ban jaaenge
 The two not only met but Trump also invited Kim Jong Un to come to the White House
 korea kii kahani bahut utaar chadhaav vaali he
 Actually, Korea was the same 70 years ago
 lekin baad main uske do tukade ho gaye
 Yes yes kareeb 70 saal pehle ek tha korea
 But then everything happened after which Korea was split into two
 ek uttar korea ban gaya
 Second South Korea
 magar bantwaare ke baad se hi dakshin korea to shant rahaa
 After some time, he also caught the path of democracy
 magar uttar korea ke saath aisa kya hua ki wo bambaaz ban gaya
 Fall behind bombs and missiles? His enmity with South Korea is nevertheless understandable
 par america se uski aisi kya dushmani he? to in saare sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane ke liye ek tha korea kii kahani jaananaa jaruri he
 Today, these two countries are seen on the map of the border of hatreds
 darasal wo kabhi ek the
 The limit was one
 log ek the
 The nation was one
 rashtradhyaksh ek tha
 But this line of border drawn on the basis of hatred made it the most dangerous border in the world
 border ke ek taraf kaa desh uttar korea kahalaaya to duusari taraf kaa dakshin korea
 This story of Dastankoria of the Korea dynasty begins from the era of the Silla dynasty
 
 Korea had a strong identity on the world map, separate from China and Japan in the Korean Peninsula under the Silla rule of about 900 years
 magar 20veen sadi aate aate sila rajvansh kii pakad korea par kamjor padane lagi
 Japan Occupied in 1910 Japan occupied the Silla dynasty in 1910, after nearly a decade and a half of domination in the Korea Peninsula
 magar japani kabze ke saath hi is mulk main vidroh kii aag bhadakni shuru ho gai
 The Koreans formed several rebel organizations for their independence
 jinamein se kuch chini auki soviet communist samarthak the
 And some organizations had US support
 chini communiston ke saath milakar vidrohi kim sang il ne ek gorilla fouj taiyaar kii jo japan se muqabla kar rahi thi
 The independence gained from Japan in 1945 and the American hostility in the second world war which lasted from 1939 to 1945 was heavy for the Japanese
 or is yuddh main buree tarah haarane ke saath hi japan ko hathiyaar daalane pade
 With this, Korea became free from the clutches of Japan after 36 years of slavery
 magar tab tak dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chate nahin thea
 The whole world was then seen splitting into two groups
 ek america gut or doosraa soviet gut
 Korean rebels were also not untouched by this
 aazaadee ke baad korea ke do tukdekoria ko japan se aazaadee to mil gai par japan ke korea chhodte hi korea main grihayuddh jaise halaat ban gaye
 The factions formed for independence were now divided into two separate power centers
 korea ke uttari hisse par apana kabza jamaaye kim il sang ke communist gut ko soviet sangh kaa samarthan hasil tha
 So, the faction of anti-communist leader Sigman Ri, who dominated the southern part of Korea, had the support of the US
 ab halaat aise bane kii donon ke kabze vaale ilaakon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue korea ke do tukade kar die gaye
 After partition, one became North Korea and the other was South Korea
 15 agast 1948: vibhaajan ke baad vivadamgar vibhaajan kaa ye vivaad to abhi shuru hi hua tha
 After independence from Japan in 1947, the United States took the initiative to make Korea a nation again through the United Nations
 iske saath hi america ke samarthan se sigaman ri ne puure korea par adhikaar jamaate hue tseol main republic of korea ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But 25 days after this announcement, Kim Il Sang also announced his right over Korea by announcing the formation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Pyongyang
 bantwaare ke baavjood donon deshon ke bich sainya or raajnneetik ladaai jari rahi
 June 25, 1950: Attack on South Korea, the dispute over the right to Korea is still going on, that on June 25, 1950, North Korea ruler Kim Il Sang attacked South Korea with the help of China and Soviet Union
 or yaheen se shuru hua korian yuddh
 In this war, the Soviet Union was on North Korea and America was on South Korea
 teen saal tak yuddh chalaa jisamen lakhon log maare gaye
 27 July 1953: Ceasefire declaration After three years of fighting, finally after the mediation of many countries, on 27 July 1953, both countries declared a ceasefire
 lekin iske baavjood donon deshon main tanaav bana rahaa
 Which continues even today
 donon deshon kii seemaa ko bina sainik gasht vaali mahaz dhai mile kii ye tarbandi ek-duusare se alag karti he

 Eminent journalist and writer MJ Akbar on Sunday said that the Muslims of the country should vote in favor of those who talk about their development, not those who show fear of security
 patna sthit bihar industries associushan haul main yojit shah mushtak ahamed smriti vyaakhyaan maala ke vishay 'aarthik vikaas evam vanchit varg' par apane vichaar vyakt karte hue akbar ne kaha ki desh ke musalaamanon ko suraksha kaa bhay dikhaane vaale ko nahin balki unke vikaas kii baat karne waalon ke paksh main apana mat dena chahie
 Akbar said that the Muslims who were active participants in the independence of the country and the feeling of nationalism did not feel themselves a minority in the country before independence, but in the year 1935, a Muslim leader gave the slogan of Islam is in danger
 Such a situation arose after leaving
 akbar ne kaha ki alpsankhyak kaa jansankhya se sambandh nahin hota kyon ki agar aisa hota to brahman sahit kai anya jatiyaan alpsankhyak hotin
 He said that there is no minority who rules the country and Muslims have ruled this country for a long time and not only did they take part in the independence of the country, but they were always full of nationalism
 akbar ne kaha ki musalmaan alpsankhyak tab hue jab ve desh main satta se baahar hue or khaastaur se varsh 1935 main jab kisi muslim netaa ne yah naaraa de diya ki islam khatre main he
 He said that a Muslim may be in danger but never Islam because Islam did not remain in danger even when Prophet Hazrat Sallaho Alehe Wasallam was alone
 akbar ne kaha ki musalmaan kii desh main yah sthiti aatmavishvaas khone ke kaaran hui or ve khauf ke saae main jeene lage
 Today they waste their valuable vote not for their development but for those who believe in false security
 desh ke musalamaanon ko apni vartmaan haalat ke swayan jimmedaar tehraate hue akbar ne kaha ki is kaum ne apni haalat ke bare main swayan kabhi nahin sochaa
 He said that Muslims will have to end discrimination against their children whether they are sons or daughters, otherwise this community can never progress
 akbar ne kaha ki itihaas gavaah he ki bharat kabhi bhi garib mulk nahin rahaa he chaahe vah aazaadee ke purv yaa uske baad ho, kyonki kisi garib mulk par koi kabhi hamalaa nahin karata jabatak aapke paas kuch luutane ko nahin hoga
 Who will reach here after covering a distance of seven thousand miles
 unhone kaha ki hindustan main agar daulat nahin hoti to angrej sahit koi anya desh yahaan fouj nahin bhejtaa
 Akbar said that in 1750, China was the country producing 32 percent of the world in which it was produced, whereas India produced 24 percent of the world and China and India were the richest countries in the world
 unhone bataaya ki us samay japan dwaara puure vishwa kaa 5 pratishat, france dwaara 4 pratishat, britain dwaara 2
 8 percent, Russia produced two percent and America one percent
 akbar ne kaha ki hindustan hameshaa se ek amir mulk rahaa he jahaan garib log basate hai
 He said that before the arrival of the British, when there was a famine in some area in the country, the entire area was blocked so that the grain could not go out from there
 unhone kaha ki us samay akaal ke dauraan raajaaon or nawabon kii ore se rasoi chalaayi jaati thi jahaan garib logon ko khaanaa diya jaataa tha
 Akbar said that there was a provision for strict punishment for shoppers who reduce the amount of compensation
 unhone kaha ki 1765 main 24 pargana main angrejon kii hukumat banane ke baad desh main akaal ke samay bhi utani hi raashi landan bhejte jitani raashi saamaanya dinon main ve bheja karte the
 Akbar said that the question is not what the British did but the question is what did the people of the country do to overcome poverty despite sixty years of independence of the country
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan main desh kaa aarthik vikaas dar din-pratidin badhata ja rahaa he par bihar sahit desh ke anya praanton main garib logon ke chehre par us vikaas kaa asar nahin dikhataa
 Akbar said that according to the data released from the Prime Minister's Office last year, about 80 eighty percent of the country's population is near or below the poverty line
 akbar ne kaha rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ne prayaas karke daliton ke utthan ke liye samvidhan main aarakshan kaa praavdhaan karaayaa
 Later the Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented for the upliftment of backward classes
 unhone kaha ki aaj jab sachhar ayog kii report jisamen musalamaanon kii aarthik or shaikshanik sthiti thik nahin bataayi gayi he or us aadhaar par unhen aarakshan die jane kii baat kii jaati he to log uskaa virodh karte hai
 This is almost certainly false
 unhone agar samaaj ke dabe-kuchle logon ko aage laane ke liye aarakshan dena hi nahin he to purv main daliton or baad main pichhade varg ke logon ko kyon diya gaya
 The lecture series was also addressed by Nationalist Congress Party National General Secretary Tariq Anwar

 mumbai main mangalvaar ko maharashtra ke sabhi saansadon, vidhayakon, parshadon or padaadhikariyon kii baithak bulaai gai he jisamen is bare main vichaar kiya jayega
 This meeting has been called by party president Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra BJP President Sudhri Mungativar
 isamen loksabhaa main bhaajapa ke up netaa gopinath munde ke vidrohi tewaron se utpann sthiti par vichaar hoga
 The party's Maharashtra in-charge m Venkaiah Naidu will also be present
 sutron ne bataaya ki yah baithak mangalvaar ko mumbai main hogi
 This is seen as an open challenge to Munde by Gadkari
 yah is baat kaa bhi sanket he ki munde or gadakari ke bich kii yah ladaai ab shakti pareekshan ke jariye khule main ladi jaaegi
 The top leadership of the BJP was seen shunning the media throughout the day to avoid questions in this regard
 haalanki, aisi khabaren hai ki koi bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke liye gadakari or munde ke ‘duuton’ ke jariye charchaa jari he
 Munde and Gadkari have been in conflict for many years
 maharashtra bhaajapa main jab munde or divangat pramod mahajan kii tuuti bolti thi, us samay gadakari kii koi khaas ahmiyat nahin thi
 But the equation suddenly changed after Gadkari became BJP president

 Munde and Gadkari held a face-to-face meeting at the residence of senior BJP leader LK Advani on Sunday but could not reach any conclusion
 bataaya jaataa he ki iske baad munde ne der raat ek hotel main prakaash se bhent kii
 The two also met on Monday morning
 prakaash ne haalanki munde se baatcheet se inkaar kiya he
 It is said that Munde also met him when Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan was staying here
 in ghatnakramon ke baad gadakari ne najdiki logon ne kaha ki munde congress main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 However, some people see this as a pressure strategy being adopted by Munde
 munde bhi saarvajanik rup se abhi tak yahi kah rahe hai ki unke party chhodane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Munde has his own importance in Maharashtra BJP
 vah pichde virgon main acha prabhaav rakhane vaale mahatpurna obisi netaa hai
 He is considered the only mass leader of the BJP in the state
 bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv is sawaal se jujh rahaa he ki kya koi sauhardpurn rasta nikaala ja saktaa he yaa munde party chhod denge
 With Munde leaving the party, the backward classes of the BJP in Maharashtra may face a major setback

 ) Encouraged by the biggest win over England despite a poor start at batting, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni credited the win to the entire team but paid special praise to spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravinder Jadeja who 'proved them wrong'
 dhoni ne bharat kii duusare vanade main 127 ran se jeet ke baad kaha, ‘prayek ne acha pradarshan kiya
 We did not start well
 salaami ballebaajon ko mushkilen hui lekin yuvaraj or viraat kohli ne hamaare liye manch taiyaar kiya
 He said, "it seemed like a wicket that could be flat
" hamen laga tha ki yah suukh jayega or spinneron ko isse adhik turn nahin milegaa
 Well i was proved wrong and our spinners got the turn
 ’jadeja or aswin ne milakar paanch wicket liye or bharat ko badi jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Dhoni won the toss and justified the decision to bat first
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab shuru main tej gendbaajon ko isse thodaa madad mil rahi thi tab vah samay gujaarna mahatvapurn tha
 It was not a wicket on which you decide to field first by winning the toss
 jimmedaari ballebaajon kii thi
 The Indian captain said that at one time he thought of giving a target closer to 250 runs
 unhone kaha, ‘‘shuru main jab main or raina khel rahe the ham 240 yaa 250 ran tak pahunchane ke bare main soch rahe the
 After that, when we froze, we started thinking about giving a target of 260
 hamane 15 ran adhik banaaye
 "dhoni said," i believe this wicket was ideal for a Test match
 isse tej gendbaaj bhi phayda uthaate tathaa spinneron ke liye bhi turn tha jaisaa ki ham chaahate the
 'the next match between India and England will be played on January 19 in Ranchi, Dhoni's hometown and the Indian captain is very excited about it
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘aglaa match mere shahar main hoga or vah bahut khaas hoga
 The audience here was truly unmatched but the heat and humidity here can not be forgotten
 ’ kerala ke tej gendbaaj es srisanth ne kal abhyaas ke dauraan gendbaaji kii
 Dhoni said, 'it is good that Sreesanth is fit
 ’dhoni ne sweekaar kiya, bhartiya team main beete samay kii aakraamakata ab nahin habharat ne duusare vanade main england par shandaar jeet darj kar farm main vaapasi kii lekin captain mahendra singh dhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki unki team main beete samay kii aakraamakata maujuud nahin he, jab unhone mehmaan team ko gharelu sarajameen par pichhali do shrinkhalaaon main whitewash kiya tha
 India had beaten England 5–0 on home soil in the 2008 and 2011 ODI series but Dhoni said his team is no longer as strong as their bowling lacks aggression and the top batsmen are struggling to score runs
 dhoni ne match ke baad press conference main kaha, ‘aisa beete samay main ho chukaa he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahi he ki is shrinkhalaa main bhi aisa hi hoga
 We have things to worry about
 haa, pichhali baar ham ballebaaji ikai ke rup main khele the or hamaare gendbaaj bhi kaaphi anbhavi the jo jaanate the ki powerple or antim overon main kya karnaa he or nayi gend kaa istemaal kaise karnaa he

 The brave sons of India, the revolutionary martyrs-e-azam Bhagat Singh, Shivram Rajguru and Sukhdev, on March 23, 1931, kissed the gallows for the sake of the country
 gauratlab he ki bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru ne 1928 main lahore main ek british junior police adhikari jon saunders kii goli markar hatya kar di thi
 Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India, set up a special tribunal to prosecute the case, which sentenced the three to death
 teenon ko 23 march 1931 ko lahore central jail ke bheetar hi faansee de di gai
 Sukhdev was also convicted in this case

 But this day should also be remembered as that fear of the British, due to which these three were hanged 11 hours earlier
 teenon veeron kii faansee kii sajaa puure desh main aag kii tarah fail gai
 After which the English government was scared of the way the protests and protests were continuing regarding the hanging
 jiskaa nateeja rahaa ki bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru ko chupchaap tareeke se tay taarikh se ek din pehle hi faansee de di gai thi
 Know what happened the day Bhagat Singh was in jail, he had read many books
 23 march 1931 ko shaam kareeb 7 bajkar 33 minute par bhagat singh or unke donon saathi sukhdev or raajaguru ko faansee de di gai thi
 He was reading a biography of Lenin before going to the gallows
 jab kahaan 'thik he ab chalo'bhagat singh ko jab jail ke adhikariyon ne yah soochna di ki unki faansee kaa samay aa gaya he to unhone kaha tha- 'tehriye! pehle ek krantikari duusare se mil to le
 Then after a minute the book bounced towards the ceiling and said - 'okay now let's go'
 faansee par jate samay bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru teenon masti se ga rahe thamera rang de basanti chola, meraa rang demera rang de basanti cholamy rang de basanti cholabhagat singh par viral massej kaa ye he sach, jaaniye 14 farvari se rishtaaise the bhagat singhbhagat singh kaa janm 28 sitambar 1907 ko hua tha
 It was not a normal day, instead it is known as the glorious day in Indian history
 avibhajit bharat kii jameen par ek aise shaks kaa janm hua jo shaayad itihaas likhane ke liye hi paidaa hua tha
 The revolutionary Bhagat Singh was born into a normal family in village Baoli in district Lailpur (now in Pakistan)
 bhagat singh ko jab ye samaj main aane laga ki unki aazaadee ghar kii charadivari tak hi simit he to unhen dukh hua
 He used to repeatedly say that to get freedom from the British, we have to fight instead of asking

 congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya he ki ‘sidhe sade’ anna hajaare ko unki hi team ke kuch ‘bahut chatur chaalaak log’ apni raajnneetik aakankshaayen puri karne ke liye bali kaa bakra bana rahe hai
 The Congress general secretary, known for the attacks on Team Anna, said that he stood by his every word on the issue and his views about Hazare were also agreed by Congress leaders
 unhone haalanki spasht kiya ki is par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi se charchaa nahin kii jaati
 Expressing surprise at Anna Hazare's 'U turn' on the campaign against the Congress over the Lokpal, Digvijay said that he (hazare) was being misused by some of his own team and that he had high political aspirations for his team
 Changed its recent stance on not campaigning against any political party under pressure from some members of the US
 digvijay singh ne sienen ibien par karan thapar ke davills edwocket kaarykram main kaha ‘vah sidhe sade hai
 Anna is a very simple person
 vah dabaavon se aasaani se prabhavit ho jate hai or unke ird gird sabhi logon kaa raajnneetik agenda he
 There is a high probability of exploiting them by clever cunning people
 ’congress netaa ne kaha, ‘garib anna ko unka (team sadsy) raajnneetik agenda puraa karne ke liye bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he kyonki unki vishwasaneeyata unase zyada he
 He is a very ordinary person (human being) who is being exploited by smart people with big political aspirations
 ’apane is aarope ko doharaate hue ki aresas or bhaajapa anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ke peeche the digvijay ne poocha ‘anna yah sweekaar karne se kyon hichkicha rahe hai ki aresas ne na keval unke andolan kii yojana taiyaar kii balki log muhaiyaa karaae or iskaa samarthan kiya?’ unhone yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki hajaare ne manch se aresas or bhaajapa kaa andolan main mili unke samarthan ke liye dhanyavad vyakt kiya tha
 He questioned his (hazare's) 'double stance' to sway Narendra Modi, who did not appoint a Lokayukta in Gujarat for many years
 digvijay ne kaha ki unke dwaara hajaare or unki team ke liye kii gai tippaniyon ko lekar unhen koi khed nahin he or yadi paristhityaan aisi hi rahati hai to vah bhavishya main bhi yah jari rakhenge
 He said that Hazare unfortunately could not understand that he was being misused by RSS and BJP
 unhone aagaah kiya ‘aresas or bhaajapa se satark rahiye
 They will take you to a place where it will be difficult for you to return

 taarikh gavaah he ki duniya main jab-jab hukmaraane baheri huin hai, baghawat kii aawaaj ne unhen neend se jagaaya he or jo nahin jaage unhen takht se utaar kar takhtapalat kar diya he
 Within just two and a half years, the Egyptian people woke up the person sitting on the highest chair in the country to sleep, then behind bars
 misr kii rajdhani kahiraa ke jis taharir chowk par misr ne apane bhavishya kii ek sunahari tasviir khinchi thi, wo bhi mohammad mursi ke kursi prem kii bhent chadh gayi
 As a result, the same once again witnessed the movement at Tahrir Chowk, another movement at Tahrir Chowk and the same Tahrir Chowk, another coup in two and a half years
 mahaj dhai saal pehle isi misr main baghawat kaa jo bigul baja tha usne duniya ko chaunkaa diya tha
 Husni Mubarak's thirty-year empire was shattered like a straw in the storm of this rebellion
 laga ab misr main sab thik ho chukaa he, par faqat dhai saal main aakhir aisa kya ho gaya ki jis shaks ko chun kar khud desh kii awam ne hukumat kii chaabi saunpi thi, wo raaton-raat sabaki ankhon main khatakane laga? misr main takhtapalat kii yah kahani jitani utaar-chadhaav vaali he, utani hi ahm, kyonki ye kahani bataati he ki jamhuriyat main awam kii naa sunne kaa anjaam kya hote hai
 It is said that history repeats itself, but the rebellious history of Egypt, which is known only for its history, will be repeated so soon, no one thought this
 morsi ko raashtrapati pad se hataaya jaataa he or desh ke samvidhan ko thande baste main daalaa jaataa he
 After the ouster of Morsi, Egypt's Chief Justice Adali Mansour has been appointed as acting president
 darasal, misr kii awam or vipakshi partiyon ne pichley chaar dinon se morsi ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa tha
 People gathered in Tahrir Chowk in number of lakhs and were shouting slogans of President Quit Gaddi
 jab morsi par awam kii maang kaa koi asar nahin hua to sena ne mursi ke khilaaf kaman sambhaal lee or kursi chhodane ke liye unhen 48 ghante kaa ultimatum de daalaa, lekin mursi ne sena kii chetavanee ko nazarandaaj kar kursi chhodane se inkaar kar diya
 On Wednesday evening, when the Army's Ultimate Term was over, the Army started camping at important locations in Cairo
 sena ke tanks shahar main jagah jagah najar aane lage
 Thousands of soldiers started to look at the bases where the Mursi supporters were standing, then it was clear that the army had prepared for the coup and then within a few hours the army announced the removal of Morsi
 sena ke elaan ke saath hi taharir chowk par date mursi virodhiyon main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 In fact, two and a half years ago the Egyptians, who were smoldering against the dictatorship, breathed open air for the first time when the fortress of Hosni Mubarak collapsed in the fire of their anger on 11 February 2011
 iske baad desh main pehali baar chunaav hue or logon ne hukumat kii chaabi mursi ke haathon main saunp di
 The responsibility on Morsi was even greater because he had to truly fulfill the aspirations of a country that came out of the shell of dictatorship, but Mursi was left as chair
 sena ne mursi ko gaddi se bedakhal to kar diya, lekin sukun kii baat yah he ki sena ne satta apane haathon main nahin lee
 Although the political crisis has deepened once again in Egypt after the coup, there are reports that the army has prepared a roadmap to overcome this crisis, which will be announced by the Sheikh of Al Azhar
 al ajahar misr kaa sabase pratishthit islamic santhaan mana jaataa he
 It remains to be seen how soon this announcement happens and how soon it is decided to hold elections for the formation of a new government in Egypt
 jo ki misr kii janata kii sabase badi maang he
 The controversy over stopping Namaz in Noida Park was not even stopped now that the administration stopped the Srimad Bhagwat Katha going on in Greater Noida
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki iske liye samuchit anumati nahin lee gai thi
 Tents, durries, loudspeakers etc
 were arranged for the Srimad Bhagwat Katha on a plot in Sector 37 of Greater Noida
 dopaher main greater noida vikaas praadhikaran ke adhikari daste ke saath pahunche or tent ukhaad diya
 He argued that the necessary permissions for this religious event have not been taken
 is karrwai se naaraaz mahilaayein vahaan dharne par baith gayi
 The local people claimed that all the people are buying this land for religious purposes
 praadhikaran kii taraf se bhi ye nishchit kar diya he ki ye jagah dharmik he
 So far, people have collected 25 lakh rupees to buy it
 isamen kisi ne 11 hajaar, kisi ne 5 hajaar to kisi ne 1100 rupye die hai
 In this place, Bhagwat Katha was organized by placing a pandal in the previous Navadurga
 is katha ke liye pichley 25 dinon se prachaar-prasar ho rahaa tha
 Tents were installed yesterday evening and at 10 o'clock this morning, the authorities came here and uprooted everything
 praadhikaran ke vishesh karyaadhikari sachin singh ne samachar agency bhashaa ko bataaya ki unhen kaarykram ke liye anumati nahin di gayi he
 If they still do it then it would be illegal
 vahiin sthaneey police ne bataaya ki praadhikaran dwaara kii gai is karrwai se uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Greater Noida (I) officer Nishank Sharma said that this action has been taken by the authority officers and police personnel associated with the authority
 jila police yaa sthaneey kasana police thane kaa koi adhikari vahaan nahin tha
 An official said that the RWA of the sector was not involved in organizing the event and the main organizer is from outside the sector
 is bhukhand se atikaraman shaam 5 baje tak khaali kara liya gaya or tab tak adhikari vahaan khadey rahe
 It is worth noting that recently, in Sector 58, Noida, the police issued a notice to 23 companies while prohibiting the offering of Namaz in a park
 isamen kaha gaya ki shuukravaar ko yahaan namaaj nahin padhi ja sakati
 There was a lot of ruckus on it
 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne kaha ki yadi is niti ko lagu karnaa he to ise sabhi jilon or sabhi dharm ke logon par lagu kiya janaa chahie
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi also jumped into the controversy
 unhone twit kar kaha ki uttar pradesh ke pulicekarmi kaanvadiyon par gulab kii pankhudiyaan barasaate hai lekin saptaah main ek baar namaaj se shanti evam bhaichara baadhit hota he
 Neither does anyone in the capital Delhi fear the police
 or naa hi kanoon kaa khauf
 If it were not so, how would anyone dare to kill someone in broad daylight
 wo bhi sirf maamuli baat par
 In Khyala, Delhi, a landlord publicly adopted his own tenants with a knife
 is hamale main do logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki ek jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahaa he
 The murderer escaped after committing the crime
 lekin kuch ghante baad hi use police ne daboch liya
 He kept on beating, people kept on screaming while watching
 wo madad ke liye guhaar lagaataa rahaa
 Begging for life lekin us vahashi shaks ke sir par to khun savaar tha
 He continued to stab with a knife
 naa koi raham
 No Mural ye sab kuch dilli ke khyala ilaake main didie janaka flats kii ek gali ke bich main ho rahaa tha
 The attacker was attacking with a knife
 or puri gali ke log dam saadhe tamaasha dekh rahe the
 Someone was making a video of the same
 45 second, 50 warais dauraan kisi ne himmat nahin dikhaai
 No one came forward to save the victim
 or badmaash bekhauf hokar chaaku se martha rahaa
 One after the other

 He struck almost fifty times
 uskaa pet cheer daalaa
 In between, his wife came to save the victim
 betaa aayaa
 But the killer did not spared him either
 wo chaaku chalaata rahaa
 Kept on attacking teenon ko lahooluhaan karne ke baad wo aaraam se chalaa gaya
 Nobody helped but easily escaped from the neighborhood of the old people
 jameen padaa shaks khun se lathpath tha
 The intestines of the stomach had come out
 ab bhi madad kii guhaar laga rahaa tha
 But no one came forward to help
 ek shaks himmat kar aage badha to ek mahila se use roak diya
 After all, what kind of humanity is this? ye kisi dilli he
 The landlord became thirsty for the life of the tenant due to the unpleasant things of the husband and wife
 kiraye na dene par makaan maalik is kadar baukhalaayaa ki kirayedar, uski patni or bete par chaaku se hamalaa kar diya
 When the police arrived after the incident, all the injured were rushed to the hospital
 lekin tab tak mahila kii maut ho chuki thi
 Later, her husband too succumbed
 betaa gambhir rup se jakhmi he
 The person who died was someone from the locality who made a video of the incident from the phone
 police ne video dekha
 After showing promptness, he attacked the attacker after a few hours
 lekin usne 45 second main chaakukand kaa jo nanga naach kiya
 Due to this, the humanity of Delhi people got clouded in questions
 choti si baat par kiya murderjankaree ke mutabik hamalavar kaa naam aaazaad he
 He had rented his house to Veeru
 viru ke saath uski patni sunita or betaa akaash or ek choti beti bhi rahata thi
 It is being told that Sunita's daughter was playing on the terrace
 tabhi vahaan rakhi pani kii bottle se pani neeche gir gaya, jo vahaan khadey aaazaad par gira
 When Sunita came out of her house, Azad started quarreling with her about this
 kiraye kaa vivaad pehle se chal rahaa tha
 Many small things are coming out as the reason behind the murder
 police ab aaropee aaazaad se poochtacha kar rahi he
 There is an atmosphere of panic in the entire area due to this incident

 andhra pradesh main nai rajdhani amravati main hi banegi yaa kahin or?jagan mohan sarkaar duusare sthanon kaa vikalp talashne main jutivipaksh main rahete jagan ne amravati main rajdhani banane kaa kiya tha virodhandhra pradesh main wiesar congress kii jagan mohan reddy sarkaar amravati se kahin duusari jagah nai rajdhani bana sakati he
 This is indicated by the rhetoric of the minister and party leaders
 pichhali tidipi sarkaar main jab mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu, hyderabad se rajya kii rajdhani amravati main shift kar rahe the tab vipaksh main rahete hue jagan mohan reddy ne iskaa mukhar hokar virodh kiya tha
 Jagan has been accused of a big scam in making Amravati the capital of Andhra Pradesh
 jagan mohan reddy ne tab kaha tha ki andhra pradesh main siem rahete chandrababu naidu kii companiyon ne amravati main kisaanon se oune-paune daam par jameen kharidne kaa khel kiya he
 It is being told that Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is looking for an alternative to Amravati
 nai rajdhani ke liye shivaramkrishnanan kamity ke prastaavon par bhi sarkaar vichaar kar rahi he
 He is also calling meetings for this
 agar amravati se kahin or rajdhani banane kaa siem jagan ne faisla kiya to chandrababu naidu ko bada jhatka lagegaa
 Creating a new capital in Amravati has been Chandrababu Naidu's dream project
 mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan naidu kehete the ki amravati ko vah aisi model rajdhani banaaenge ki desh ke duusare rajya bhi prerana lenge
 Naidu acquired 33 thousand acres of land in Amravati during the time of the TDP government
 haalanki upjau ilaakon main shumaar amravati main rajdhani banane ko lekar virodh hota aayaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in 2015 on the call of Naidu, laid the foundation of the new capital in Amravati
 us vakt kaha gaya tha ki 2024 tak nai rajdhani puri tarah ban jaaegi
 Please tell that after the partition of Andhra Pradesh, the capital Hyderabad went to Telangana account
 vibhaajan ke dauraan tay hua tha ki nai rajdhani banane tak andhra pradesh kii sarkaar hyderabad ko rajdhani ke rup main istemaal kar sakati he
 Minister said- Amravati is submerged in floods
 Recently, Andhra Pradesh Urban Development Minister Botsa Satyanarayana had said that the Krishna River area is flooded, so there is a need to reconsider the decision to make Amravati the capital
 kyonki yahaan baadh aa jaati he
 There is a need to build dams etc
 in Amravati
 unhone amravati main rajdhani banane main zyada kharch aane kii bhi baat kahi thi
 Said that if it takes one lakh rupees to build the capital at other places, then two lakhs have to be spent in Amravati
 mantri ke is bayaan ke baad rajya main atakalein lagane lageen hai ki jagan sarkaar kisi or jagah rajdhani shift kar sakati he
 BJP said- Jagan should be clear on the capital
 Seeds of confusion about the new capital in Andhra Pradesh BJP has demanded clarification of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on this
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki naidu sarkaar main amravati main nai rajdhani ke nirmaan par nau hajaar karod se zyada kharch kar die gaye
 In such a situation, shifting the capital from Amravati and then to Amravati in Hyderabad would misuse public funds
 bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad or pravaktaa jiviem narsimha raav kaa kahana he ki jagan mohan sarkaar ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki kya vah amravati ko rajya kii rajdhani ke rup main aage badhanaa chaahati he yaa uski koi vaikalpik yojana he
 MP said- preparing to build four capital Rajya Sabha MP TG Venkatesh recently claimed that Jagan Mohan Reddy wants to build four capital in the state
 is plan ko dilli main vah bijepi ke sheersh netritv se saajha bhi kar chuke hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Venkatesh also supported Jagan Mohan's plan
 kaha ki isse rajya ke sabhi kshetron kaa samaan rup se vikaas hoga
 The Rajya Sabha MP claimed that Chief Minister Jagan wants to build capital in Vizianagaram, Kakinada, Guntur and Kadapa cities
 kangana ranut or aalia bhatta ke bich film manikarnika kii relies se samay se chalaa vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 On one hand, Alia Bhatt is courting Kangana's statements politely
 vahiin kangana ranut aalia par nishaanaa saadhane kaa koi bhi mauka nahin chhod rahi hai
 Now once again Kangana Ranaut has attacked Alia
 kangana ne aalia kii gali boy main kii gai acting par riect kiya he
 The controversy started with the online poll of Bollywood Life
 jahaan 2019 kii best actress ke survey main kangana ranut ne aalia bhatta ko haraaya
 Kangna was first and Alia was second in voting
 phir website se baatcheet main kangana ne kaha, ''main sharminda hum
 What was it like defeating me in Gully Boy's performance? phir se vahi munhfat ladki kaa role
 
 
 Bollywood's idea of women empowerment and good acting
 
 
 mujhe is sharmindagi se dur rakhe
 The media has taken film children very fondly
 unke ausatan kaam ke liye unhen pamper karnaa band kare, varanaa kabhi acchhee acting kaa scale nahin uthegaa
 Kangana had earlier criticized alia-ranbir for being the young face of this generation in a mid-day interview
 kangana ranut ne kaha tha- ''unhen yuva kehane kii kya baat he
 Ranbir Kapoor is 37 years old
 aalia bhatta sirf 27 saal kii hai
 At the age of 27 my mother had three children
 yah bilkul anuchit he
 There are children that are dumbbells
 ''bataa den, film manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi ko bollywood kaa saport naa milane se kangana abhi tak apaset hai
 Kangana Ranaut seems to be most angry with Alia in this regard
 kangana ne kaha tha- ''aalia ne mujhe raji kaa trailor bheja tha or film ko dekhne kii baat kahi thi
 After watching the trailer, i called Meghna Gulzar and Alia
 lekin meri film ke liye kisi kii taraf se koi rispons nahin aayaa
 '' saal 2008 main amitabh bachchan se paise lekar faraar hui rimjhim or anjali kii maa to dobaaraa saamne nahin ai lekin jab donon bahanen ek baar phir khabaron kii surkhiyaan baniin to abtak gumnaam rahe pita in donon bahanon se milane usee skool main ja pahunche, jahaan pichley 7 saalon se ye bacchiyaan pal rahi hai
 But these sisters refused to recognize their father, saying that if they go together, they will sell us
 patna ke jagat narayan road ke ek chote se skool shanti niketan main rimjhim or anjali ke pita ashok pandey or chachee anitha pandey pahunche to the in donon bahanon ko waapas ghar le jane
 But with the family whose displeasure these two sisters were feeling like orphans today, they not only refused to go with him but also refused to recognize their father
 jab ashok se yah poocha gaya ki in bacchiyon ke bare main abhi tak koisudh kyon nahin lee to unhone kaaphi taal-matol kebaad jawaab diya, 'main biimaar tha
 'then after that said that i did not know where my girls are and when i saw their pictures in the newspapers, we have come to take them
 anjali or rimjhim kii chachee, jisane bachapan main donon bahanon kaa paala tha, aaj in bacchiyon se milin to apane saath pahachaanake liephoto bhi laayi, lekin rimjhim or anjali ne chachee ko bhi pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 According to Anita, the mother of these girls left them in childhood and escaped with money from Amitabh Bachchan
 ab jabaki donon bacchiyaan badi ho rahi hai aise main agar inaki maa ne inhen bech diya to parivaar kii pratishtha chali jaaegi
 On the other hand Rimjhim and Anjali do not want to go home
 anjali kahati he ki itane saalon tak to ye hamen poochne tak nahin aae
 We are fine as we are here, while Rimjhim says that if we go with him, these people will sell us
 baharhaal donon bacchiyaan apane parivaar ke saath nahin gayi
 Both of them have been fearing that their mother first took money in their name and now after so many years their father has only remembered their greed
 mauni amavasya ke parv par aaj deshbhar kii nadiyon main lakhon logon ne aasthaa or shraddha kii dubkee lagaai
 People have started bathing on the Sangam coast of Allahabad since morning
 ganga, yamuna or adrishy saraswati ke sangam par manyata he ki sristi ke paalak bhagwaan vishnu balak ke rup yani benimadhav ke rup main vidyaman hai or pralay ke baad sristi kii sanrachana yaheen se karenge
 So, by donating a bath silently on the day of Mauni Amavasya in Magh month on the Sangam Beach, one attains renewable virtue, and devotees from all over the country are taking a dip of faith and faith to attain this virtue
 manyata he ki aaj ke din maun rakhkar ganga main snaan kar daan karne se akshay punya ke saath moksh kii bhi prapti hoti he
 It is also said that on this day, drops of nectar also fell on the earth
 lihaaja aaj ke din ganga main snaan karne se bahut punya miltaa he
 People are taking a bath since morning in Dashashwamedh Ghat of Varanasi with this salvation
 makar sankranti ke baad surya uttarayan ho jaataa he or aaj ke din purna uttarayan surya jahaan apni sampoorn urja logon main bharta he to vahiin kaashi main uttar kii disha bahane vaali ganga kii dhara bhakton ko akshay punya detii he
 This is the reason that people are donating baths on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya
 aam aadmi party ne der se hi sahi apane pattey kholane shuru kar die hai
 Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal is tired of answering public questions
 sawaal un tamaam vaadon par hai jo puure nahin ho paae hai or jinke bare main unhone kaha tha ki party ke satta main aane ke kuch hi dinon main ve puure ho jaaenge
 Their problem was that these promises were not such that they would be fulfilled in a week or ten days, when they put them in front of the public in the excesses of enthusiasm
 aalochanaon ko jhelte hue ab vah us mukaam par aa gaye the ki unhen kuch bada kar dikhaanaa hi tha
 Something big that will send a good message to the public and make it a state of martyrdom
 1984 dangon kii jaanch ke liye unhone aadesh to de hi diya, ab shila dikshit par hi hamalaa bol diya he
 He announced before the election that he would feed Sheela Dixit the jail air on charges of corruption
 ab unhone kaamanwealth games main bhrashtachar kii file anti karpshan beuro main bhej di he
 This means that now FIR will be registered on the former CM
 dilli kaa baccha-baccha yah jaanata he ki kaamanwealth games main jamkar bhrashtachar hua or afasaron tathaa netaaon ne khub lut machaai
 But only Kalmadi got stranded
 dilli kii siem, anya netaa or afasar bedaag bachakar nikal gaye
 The fingers were raised on them but no action was taken
 ab kejariwal ne ek badhiya daanv khelaa he
 He is aware that his government may fall on this issue
 congress shaayad hi is chot ko bardaasht kar paae
 Sheila Dixit has been one of the most beloved leaders of the high command and has always found refuge there
 sonia gandhi se unke antarang sambandh rahe hai or yahi kaaran tha ki jab bhi dilli congress main asantosh kii lahar uthati thi, use dabaa diya jaataa tha
 Of course, whatever the Congress leaders say, this attack of CM Kejriwal is such that the party will have to take some big step and this is what they want
 congress kaa har bada kadam aam aadmi party ko lokapriy banayega
 It may last until the withdrawal of support
 yah aam aadmi party ke bhavishya ke liye badhiya hoga kyonki baad ke chunaav main vah kah sakate hai ki unki eemaandaar sarkaar "beyimaanon" ne gira di
 This could become a good weapon for them in the next elections and Lok Sabha elections
 congress dwaara sarkaar kaa giraaya janaa party ke hit main he
 After this, he can stand in martyr posture
 saal 2016 bhartiya test cricket ke svarnim varsh ke rup main yaad rakhaa jayega
 The success of the Indian team this year and the might of cricketers has made the team and the players number one in the ICC rankings, writing the script of this team's highs in world cricket in the coming years
 agle saal yani 2017 main bhi bhartiya cricket kii tuuti bolti rahegi or is prayaas main vaise to sabhi khilaadiyon kaa yogadan hoga lekin antarrashtriya or rashtriya str par ye paanch aise cricketer hai jinaki bulandiyon ke charche honge
 The command of this five-star team will also be in the hands of the world's most famous cricketer Virat Kohli and will be accompanied by Ravichandran Ashwin, the number one all-rounder in the world, while Ravindra Jadeja, who is ranked third in the bowling rankings, will also be here
 in teen naamon ke alaava or bhi kai bade naam hai jo 2017 main apane cricket hunar se itihaas likhenge lekin mumbai main tihara shatak jadne vaale karun nair or bataur openar pari kii shuruyaat se lekar ant tak note out rahete hue sabase bade score kaa record todane vaale samit gohil iske anya do sadsy honge
 Virat Kohli, India's Test captain and the highest run-scorer in the current team, Virat Kohli will once again continue to dominate in 2017
 2016 ke calendar saal main viraat ne team kii har jeet main yogadan diya
 75 in Test cricket
 94 kii ausat or chaar shatakon kii badaulat 1215 ran banaae to 10 vanade main teen shatak or 81 kii ausat se 648 ran
 642 runs in 15 international T20 matches at an average of 92 as well as 87 in IPL
 18 kii ausat or 153
 959 runs with a strike rate of 93, including four centuries
 ye viraat kaa 2016 main lagaataar balle se rahaa pradarshan he to bataur captain wo bhale hi apni bangaleru team ko ipel nahin dilaa sake lekin team india ko test main best bana diya
 For the second time after Dhoni, Team India became the top ranked team in Test cricket and also undefeated in 18 consecutive Test matches
 saal 2017 kii shuruyaat bhi vanade cricket se ho rahi he
 The difference is that Team India will take on the British on their land, whereas last year they lost to the Kangaroos by 1-4 on their land
 iske baad bangladesh se ek test or phir kangaaroon ke saath muqabla viraat ko bharat main hi karnaa he
 Cricket Australia has appointed Virat as the captain of their World XI and put their team captain Steve Smith in that team, then it is certain that they consider Virat to be better captain than Smith
 viraat apni captaini main jin do test maichon ko ganvaa chuke hai unamem se ek australia ke khilaaf tha or steve smith se unki hui takaraar to jagajaahir he
 That is, when Kangaroo comes to India, Virat will not only as a batsman but also as a captain, it is 100% possible
 ravichandran aswin30 varshiya ravichandran aswin ne is saal 12 test maichon main 43
 He scored 612 runs at an average of 71 and 23 from 12 Tests
 90 kii ausat se duniya ke kisi bhi gendbaaj se zyada 72 wicket liye
 He has done the highest number of wickets in a calendar year for the second consecutive year
 keval 44 test main unke viketon kii sankhya 248 par pahunch gai he or 2017 main unka sabase tej 250 wicket lene vaala bhartiya gendbaaj bananaa tay he
 In 2016, he could play only two odis, but he finished second in the year 2016 (with 23 wickets in 17 matches) in terms of maximum wickets in T20s
 bharat kii jeet main jitna yogadan captain viraat kohli kaa he ravichandran aswin kaa usase kam nahin
 The success of the Indian team in 2017 is also largely dependent on Ashwin's success
 ravindra jadejatim india kii 2016 main apane gharelu maidaanon par safalataa kaa shrey captain kohli or phiraki ke fan ke maahir aswin ke alaava ravindra jadeja ko bhi jaataa he jinhone is saal 24
 Took 43 wickets at an average of 56 and reminded India of its golden era
 jadeja ne mumbai test main aadhi english team kaa safaya kar na keval aswin ke jodidar ke rup main khud ko sthapit kiya balki isisi ranking main bhi duusare sthaan par ja pahunche
 In 2017, India has to play the first five Tests on its own soil and Jadeja's success is as important to the success of Team India as Ashwin's
 iske saath hi gharelu cricket main bhi unke pradarshan par najar rahegi kyonki 2015 main dalip trophy denite toornament ke final main wo 10 wicket lekar apni team ko jeet dilaane kaa karnama kar chuke hai
 Karun Nair: Karun Nair, who played for the Karnataka team at home level, holds the record for becoming the first Indian to score a triple century (303 not out) in the Chennai Test as the first century of his career
 wo apane kariyar kii mahaj teesri test pari main tihara shatak jamaane vaale bhi duniya ke pehle ballebaaj hai
 Nair also 55 in first class matches
 01 kii ausat or nau shatakon kii madad se 3191 ran bana chuke hai
 In March 2015, it was Karun who broke the 68-year-old record by scoring a triple century in the final of the Ranji Trophy
 karun indian premier lig (ipel) main royal chalangers bangaleru, rajasthan royles or dilli dairedevills ke liye khel chuke hai
 This year, he was bought for four crore rupees and while playing for Delhi Daredevils, he paid his price and added important runs
 samit bhanubhai gohelgujarat ke 26 varshiya samit bhanubhai gohil ne ardhashatak ke saath apane pratham shrenee cricket kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 This year he scored a good innings in Ranji against Uttar Pradesh (60 and 50), Madhya Pradesh (34, 104) and Mumbai (87, 18) before scoring an unbeaten triple century (359)
 odisha ke khilaaf jaipur main kheli gai is yaadgaar pari ke dauraan gohil ne pratham shrenee cricket kii duusari pari kaa (sar don breadman ke baad) doosraa sabase bada score banaaya
 It was only the third-largest after Vijay Hazare (309) and Cheteshwar Pujara (352) in the second innings of Ranji Trophy, followed by BB Nimbalkar (443 not out), Sanjay Manjrekar (377), MV Sridhar (366) and overall (vijay Merchant's) Jointly) also has the fourth highest score
 bhartiya team main to gohil kii entry abhi 2017 main pratham shrenee main unke balle ke pradarshan par nirbhar he
 Yes, the performance of triple century Virat Kohli, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly has definitely kept his eye on him
 kai naam or bhi hanaisa nahin he ki bhartiya cricket ke keval in paanch dhurandharon se hi pradarshan kii ummide hai
 Each member of the team can be astonished at any time by their performance during any match and innings as there is more than one unique player in this team
 udhaaharan ke taur par jasprit bumraah orlokesh rahulko len
 Bumrah has not been able to enter Test cricket so far, but he was the highest bowler to take 17 wickets in odis and 28 wickets in T20
 vahiin lokesh rahul ne cricket ke teenon hi formet main antarrashtriya shatak laga kar cricket ke bade manch par ek naye star ke janm kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 In the Chennai Test in which Karun Nair hit a triple century, Rahul also scored a century and also shared a 161-run partnership for the fourth wicket with his Karnataka teammates
 2017 kii june main bharat ko champions trophy bhi khelnaa he lihaaja janvari main england ke khilaaf is formet par sabhi kii nazar rahegi
 It is necessary to mention one thing here that the players of Karun Nair and Jayant Yadav, who are playing in the national team today, have a great contribution by the coach of the Under 19 team Rahul Dravid in reaching the national level
 2017 main rahul dravid, anil kumble or viraat kohli kii tikdi kya gul khilaaegi yah to aane vaala vakt hi bataayegaa
 At the moment it is not difficult to say that the future of Indian cricket is in safe hands

 His prediction was linked to Narendra Modi
 2
 At the World Trade Center, Hamalanstradamus had said in his prophecy that two big differences would happen which would lead to war
 or aasmaan aatank kaa ilaaka banegaa
 This prediction of Nostradamus was linked to the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center

 Hitler's rise was predicted by Nostradamus in the Second World War

 5

 Nostradamus had said that there would be two such explosions which would have a long lasting effect
 hamaare desh main cricket ko ek aise khel ke taur par dekha jaataa he ki iske behtareen khilaadi (sachin) ko desh ke bheetar bhagwaan kaa darja praapt he
 Some are called grandfathers here, others are called Mr
 Wall
 kisi kaa collar khadaa karnaa fishan ban jaataa he to kisi kaa kalai modane kaa andaaj aaj bhi logon ko ab tak yaad he
 If you look at today's team, Cheteshwar Pujara has made his place in place of Rahul Dravid, once called Mr
 Wall of the Indian team
 unki batting main logon ko rahul dravid kii jhalak dikhti he
 They are also connected to the pitch on the same pitch as Rahul was once

 Two days ago, three tremors were felt in Nepal
 -input PTI se Kapil Sharma, who tickles crores of people with his comedy, is in trouble these days
 unki jindagi behad mushkil daur se guzar rahi he
 Controversies are not taking the name of leaving him
 kapil ke puraane saathi baar-baar unhen biimaar bataa rahe hai
 In such difficult times, Kapil was seen with his childhood friend and star Chandan
 unhone kaha ki kapil bahut imotional insaan he
 These days only negative things are being read about him everywhere
 aisa nahin hona chahie
 Boli Bharti in support of Kapil Sharma - Everything can happen but
 
 
 chandan prabhakar ne kapil ke bare main kaha ki kapil kaaphi tanaav main hai or unki davaaiyaan chal rahi he
 His condition is not good, so shooting for family time has been stopped
 kapil abhi aaraam kar rahe he
 Give them some time to recover
 unke baaren main itani negative baaten mat failaaen
 My friend has shared happiness with the country for so long, so much bitterness is not good for him
 kapil bahut sidhaa aadmi he, use sidhi baat kerani aati he
 Chandan said- Negative articles about Kapil broke him
 unhone khushi jataai ki kapil ke sabhi sachche dost unke saath hai jisaki unako is padaav main kaaphi jarurat he
 Kapil Sharma is eating 23 pills in 1 day, let the comedians in trouble, a new update has come out about Kapil's health

 Two days ago, 25 Central Reserve Police Force soldiers were killed in an ambush by Maoists in Sukma, Chhattisgarh
 in 25 jaanbaaj javaanon main 6 bihar ke the
 As soon as the mortal body of these 6 soldiers arrived at Patna Airport by special plane from Raipur, Chhattisgarh on Tuesday evening, as if the insensitivity of the Bihar government came one after the other
 airport se baahar jaise hi in shaheedon ke parthiv sharir ko baahar laayaa gaya, inako airport ke saamne hi gadiyon ko park karne kii jagah par shradhanjali di gai
 The shocking thing after that was that no minister of Bihar government came to pay tribute to the mortal remains of these martyrs
 aise main rahi sahi kasar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne puri kar di
 It is worth noting that while the mortal remains of the martyrs reached Patna Airport and they were being paid tribute, the path along the Nitish Kumar Airport was attending the authority's eighth Foundation Day program in the office of Bihar State Road Development Authority
 sawaal ye uth rahe hai aakhir mukhyamantri ko itani fursat bhi nahin mili ki chand kadam par sthit patna airport jakarshaheedon ko shradhanjalide saken ? agar itnaa kaaphi nahin tha to aage suniye phir kya hua
 The dead bodies of the martyrs were boarded in separate trains to take them to their ancestral village and were stopped as soon as the vehicles were about to leave Patna airport

 Frustrated by last-time champions Spain's first round exit of the World Cup, their players have started showing their bloodshed to media persons, but all limits have been crossed when full-back Jordi Alba clashes with a journalist and is beheaded
 Threatened to do

 In the 'mixed Zone', journalists gathered to talk to the players
 tab alba ‘age’ ke reporter jevier gomage matalanes ke kareeb se gujarey or unhone jate hue kaha, ‘agali baar main tumhaara sir kalam karuunga
 When Matalanas expressed surprise at this, Alba again repeated, "yes, yes next time i am
" main tumhen chetavanee detaa hum
 After this, a similar threat was given to the journalist at the airport
 matalanes ko haalanki pataa nahin ki aakhir alba unase kyon gussa hai
 He said, 'I don't remember that i ever wrote anything about him
 ’ If this question is asked what is the most relaxing thing in the scorching heat, then the answer to many people will probably be one - ice cream
 lekin agar koi kah de ki aapaki icecream main boar kii charbi mili he to uske baad kya aap apni pasandida cheez kha paaenge? shaakaahaari logon kii baat to chhodie, iske baad zyaadaatar log icecream khaane se pehle sau baar sochenge
 When a message started going viral, in which ice cream is being said to contain pig fat, we decided to test it viral
 aage kii baat jaanane se paheleis photo ko dhyaan se dekhie
 According to this message, it is being claimed that Amul's pistachio cream has got pig fat
 icecream ke pakat par gola lagaakar E- 407 or E-412 naam ke do padaarthon main boar kii charbi hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the information printed on the packet of Amul, both these things have been used as stabilizers
 agar aap google par amul hi nahin, kisi bhi iscream ke packet kaa photo nikaal kar dekhen to pataa chalegaa ki stablizars kaa istemaal lagbhag har icecream main kiya jaataa he
 We contacted the quality control department of Amul's factory in Anand, Gujarat to find out what are the stabilizers and why they are used
 vahaan se pataa chalaa ki stablizars kaa matlab hota he wo padaarth jo icecream main aais ke crystal banane se rokte hai, use mulaayam banaate hai or thandak kam hone par use teji se pighalane se rokte hai
 But the real challenge was to find out the truth of whether the pig named E-407 and E-412 were really found in the pig fat? contacted
 bharat main istemaal hone vaali khaane-pine kii sabhi chizon ke gunvattta kii jaanch kaa kaam FSSAI hi karata he
 FSSAI adviser Sunil Bakshi told us that e in food items means that these substances have been allowed by the European Economic Community (EEC) to be added to food
 aise padaarthon kii puri ek list he
 It is clear from every number what the substance is
 bakshi ne bataaya ki E-407 kairajinan hota he jo samudr main ugane vaale laal elgi (shaiwal) se banataa he
 Its highest production is in the Philippines
 isi tarah E-412 kaa matlab he guar gam jo ek fali se niklaa he or daal jaise guar gam ke beej ko pis kar uskaa powder banaaya jaataa he
 It is also produced in large quantities in India and is also exported to many countries from here
 sunil bakshi ne kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki ye donon chijen paudhon se nikalati hai isliye puri tarah shaakaahaari hai
 He told that it is used extensively in making ice cream all over the world
 hamane amul ke em di aar es sodhi se bhi poocha ki kya amul ke icecream main maansahaari padaarth hone kii baat main koi sachai he ? sodhi ne bataaya ki amul ke har khaane kii cheez main sirf or sirf shaakaahaari padaarthon kaa hi istemaal hota he
 The substances about which false rumors are being spread are also plant products, so they are completely vegetarian
 sweden kii ek websitelalchertiniering
 se not only gives detailed information about the additives to be added to all the food items, but also clarifies whether these things are edible according to the religion of Islam or not
 is website par jaakar bhi jab hamane check kiya yahi paaya ki E-407 or E-412 na sirf shaakaahaari padaarthon kii list main hai balki saaf likhaa he ki ye islam ke hisaab se bhi halaal hai
 It is clear that in our viral test, the fact that we got pig fat in Amul ice cream proved completely wrong

 apni raajnneetik viraasat ke uttaradhikari ko lekar lagaae ja rahe kayaason ko viraam dete hue tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri karunanidhi ne shuukravaar ko apane putr em ke stallin ko rajya kaa up mukhyamantri niyukt kar diya
 According to a release issued from Raj Bhavan, the DMK chief has given the responsibility of industries, general administration, district revenue officer and minority welfare departments to his 55-year-old son Stalin
 ab tak yah vibhaag karunanidhi ke paas the
 Stalin is currently in charge of the party's youth wing
 varsh 1975 ke apatkaal ke dauraan misa ke tahat giraftaar kiye jane ke baad surkhiyon main aae stallin ke paas gramin vikaas vibhaag evam sthaneey prashasan vibhaag bana rahegaa
 Stalin was the Mayor of Chennai from 1996 to 2001 in Karunanidhi's previous tenure
 karunanidhi kaa gat farvari main peeth ke dard ke kaaran aaparishan kiya gaya tha or tab se hi atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki stallin unke uttaradhikari banenge
 Stalin was a prominent campaigner for the DMK in Karunanidhi's absence in the Lok Sabha elections
 stallin ko shuukravaar ko up mukhyamantri niyukt kiya gaya jabaki unke bade bhai ajhagiri ko guuruuvaar ko samprag sarkaar main kendriya rasayan evam urvarak mantri ke taur par shapath dilaai gai thi
 Karunanidhi said in a statement that he was unable to pay full attention to the administration due to his poor health
 karunanidhi ne kaha mujhe ek hafte main sau se zyada filein niptaani hoti hai
 i did the Finance Minister
 ambjhagan se is mudde par charchaa kii thi or unase poocha tha ki kya unhen or jimmedaari di jaani chahie
 He also cited health reasons
 unhone kaha ki charchaa ke baad yah faisla kiya gaya ki main ek yaa do mahatvapurn prabhaar rakhuunga or ambjhagan rajya vidhansabha main sadan ke netaa bane rahenge
 Stalin will be after both of us
 pichley saal june main stallin ko dramuk ke up mahasachiv se party ke koshadhyaksh ke taur par padonnat kiya gaya tha
 After this he Karunanidhi and K
 ambjhagan ke baad party padaadhikariyon main tisare number par aa gayi
 Ambazhagan is one year older than Karunanidhi (85)
 mana ja rahaa he ki stallin ko nayi jimmedaari dekar karunanidhi unki raajnneetik tarakkee kaa rasta bana rahe hai
 During the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections, the doctors had advised Karunanidhi not to travel for health reasons and Stalin commanded the campaign
 karunanidhi ke faisle par unki beti or rajyasabha sadsy kanimojhi ne kaha ki stallin ne party main urja bhari he or unke parishram ko inaam mila he
 Stalin's organizational plans came to light when he organized a massive DMK youth cell session in Tirunelveli last year
 us samay stallin ko adhik jimmedaari dene kii maang uthi thi lekin karunanidhi ne kaha tha ki uchit samay par is bare main vichaar kiya jaayegaa
 Stalin also took the initiative to end the dispute between Karunanidhi and the families of the Maran brothers
 haal hi main sampann loksabhaa chunaav ke baad bhi stallin ne hi congress or viduthalaai chiruthagal kaachi ke saath seat bantwaare par safaltaapurvak baatcheet kii
 Stalin is said to have played an important role in deciding the names of DMK candidates in the Manmohan government
 dayaanidhi maaran bhi stallin kii pasand kahe jate hai
 Stalin has always handled the affairs of the party from Chennai while his brother was sent to Madurai for care in the southern districts

 odisha mendijalki keemtpetrolki keemat se zyada ho gai he
 The Biju Janata Dal, which has been in power in the state, has questioned the BJP government at the Center, claiming that the Central Government's formula for fixing the price of petrol and diesel is wrong, due to which it is compulsive to sell diesel in the state at a price higher than petrol
 has gone

 However, ignoring this appeal, the Odisha government on Sunday claimed that the price of diesel in the state is more than petrol
 ravivaar kii keemton ke mutabik ek litre dijal kii keemat ek litre petrol se 12 paise adhik he
 Where Diesel 80 in Odisha on Sunday
 69 rupee prati litre bechaa gaya vahiin petrol kii bikri 80
 57 rupees per liter
 kya modi sarkaar ko 2019 main chunauti degaa 100 rupee litre vaala petrol?odisha sthit utkal petroleum dilers association ke general secretary sanjay lath ne bataaya ki yah pehali baar hua he ki rajya main dijal kii keemat petrol kii keemat se adhik ho gai he
 According to Latha, while all states in the country levy VAT at different rates on the price of petrol and diesel, in Odisha both petrol and diesel are charged VAT at the same rate of 26 per cent
 vahiin dijal kii keemat petrol se adhik hone ke sawaal par odisha ke vitt mantri es bi behara ne daawa kiya ki aisa kendra sarkaar kii galat nitiyon ke chalate hua he
 Behera claimed that it is also possible that oil marketing companies and the central government have colluded in setting prices

 Diesel which is costlier than petrol is also increasing the challenge for the state government
 behara ne daawa kiya ki dijal kii bikri main giravat ke chalate jahaan rajyon main maal dhulaai ke liye lagi trakon kii raftaar kam ho jaaegi vahiin jaruri utpaada kii keemton main tej oochaal dekhne ko milegaa
 In this part of the country, the cheapest petrol and diesel is available in Odisha, where Congress leader Arya Gyanendra, who was sitting in the opposition, blamed the cost of diesel on the central government, while the BJP general secretary in the state, Prithviraj Harichandan said that the state government would be costlier globally
 Keeping in mind the oil is not cutting VAT rates so that the common man can be relieved

 nashe ke saudagaron ne sthaneey kisaanon ke saath milakar ek aisa network taiyaar kar liya he jiskaa andeshaa bhi hona mushkil tha
 The crime branch officials got the news from informers that the farmers of the region are cultivating drugs under the guise of simple farming, they were once shocked
 phir shuru hui aise kisaanon kii dhar-pakad
 Result: The police got more than one and a half dozen cases of illegal cultivation of marijuana in ten months
 haal kaa, 14 may kaa maamla he bhind jile ke barseria gaanv kaa
 More than five hundred saplings of cannabis have been found in the field of farmer Purushottam Kushwaha
 usne in paudhon ko gende ke phool ke paudhon ke bich chipaaya hua tha
 a day later, in Dabra, more than 100 ganja plants were found from the farm of a farmer named Vishnu Sroti, who hid them by making a high wall on one side and planting sugarcane plants on the other side
 ganje ke paudhon ke alaava shroti ke paas se kareeb 25 kilo sookhaa ganja bhi baraamad hua
 On May 9, the crime branch was also found in a five-hectare field in the village Tigra adjacent to the city while weaving cannabis
 bhagirath or rajendra kushavaah naam ke kisaanon ne apane kheton main phulon ke bich ganje ke paudhe laga rakhe the
 There were 15,000 hemp saplings planted, which would have given them three quintals of hemp within a few months
 isse pehle shivpuri, muraina or datia ke seora gaanv main bhi anek kheton se badi sankhya main ganje ke paudhe baraamad hue the, jinhen police ne maukey par hi nasht kar diya tha

 saaf he ki anchal kii upjau jameen ko nashe ke saudagaron kii najar lag chuki he
 Farmers caught in the greed of huge profits, who once used their fertile land to grow grains, fruits or flowers, are sowing seeds of intoxication here today
 darasal ganja ke utpaadan main, kisi bhi anya fasal kii tulana main kisaanon ko bahut munafa hota he
 a plant of cannabis, if survived for six months to a year, would cost around 10,000–20,000
 kaa laabh detaa he
 In lieu of just one kilo of hemp, farmers get Rs 3,000
 milte hai
 That is, if the farmer plants only a hundred plants of cannabis in the field, then he earns a lot in a year
 jaahir he, jab kam mehnat main zyada munafa mil rahaa ho to sarson, gehun yaa chane kii fasal koi kyon lagayegaa
 Amit Sanghi, Additional Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, who exposes the illegal cultivation of cannabis, says that more than 1,000 quintals of hemp could have been produced from these 40,000 hemp plants

 chilam, hukke yaa cigarette main bharkar isaki sukhi pattiyaan or phool nasha karne ke kaam aate hai
 On processing, it produces Hashish, Keef and oil

 Special Advocate in Central Narcotics Bureau
 em
 Soni says that possessing narcotics can lead to punishment ranging from ten years to life imprisonment under the NDPS Act
 darasal ganje kaa utpaadan mote munaafe kaa dhandha he
 For example, the price of 15 quintal mustard or 30 quintal wheat planted on one hectare field is barely Rs 50,000
 hogi, jabaki ganja lagane par yahi kamai lakhon main hogi
 From a plant of cannabis, which is ready in six months and from which four to six kg of hemp can be extracted, about Rs
 20,000
 kii kamai ho jaati he

 The central government, which came under pressure on the rising petrol and diesel prices in the country, announced a cut in exide duty by slashing its coffers at Rs 26,000 crore per year
 is elaan se aam aadmi ke liye petrol or dijal main prati litre 2 rupee kii katautee hui
 Now the central government has made preparations to pressurize the state governments to further cut the prices of petrol and diesel
 sutron ke mutabik kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan sabhi rajya sarkaron ko patr likhakar apil karenge ki vah bhi petrol-dijal par liye jane vaale state tex main katautee kaa elaan karen
 Now if the state governments cut their tax on petrol and diesel, then the common man will get some relief from the rising prices of these essential fuels
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko kendra sarkaar ne petrol-dijal ke basic exise duty main 2 rupee prati litre kii katautee kii he
 This cut was made after the continuous increase in the prices of crude oil in the international market

 vahiin dijal par 15 rajyon main 20 fisadi state waite liya jaataa he or andhrapradesh main sarvaadhik 31 fisadi state waite vasula jaataa he

 Dealer commission 2 17 rupee he
 Central Government 17 on this one liter diesel

 33 rupee main se 7
 27 rupees will be returned to the state government, thereby increasing the state government's income to 15 liters on one liter of diesel
 85 rupee ho jaati he
 Hence one liter diesel 58 in the state
 06 rupee par bechakar rajya sarkaar ko 15
 The income is 85 rupees
 aam aadmi kii jeb se ek litre dilaj ke liye nikle paise kaa yah 27 fisadi he
 Good days of ending crude oil prices, let the government not fear that the daily pricing formula is the arithmetic of tax on petrol and the state government's earnings of 1 liter petrol in Delhi on 9 September 2017

 While one liter petrol 30 to the dealer
 42 rupee main mila
 3 to the dealer on this

 Pakistan Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir has said that India has not provided evidence related to the Mumbai attacks
 unhone kaha ki bharat ne jo saboot die hai wo naakaafi hai
 Just a day before, India has handed over evidence related to Mumbai attacks to Pakistan and in this one day two types of statements are coming from Pakistan
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne aatankwaad ko lekar jo kuch kaha he usase halaat or bhi badtar ho gaye hai

 Salman Bashir has said that such a statement coming from India can create war situations in the region
 'don' ke hawaale se ai is khabar main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki bharat ne mumbai hamale se jude jo bhi saboot pakistan ko saunpe hai, wo naakaafi hai
 The news published by a Pakistani newspaper 'the Nation', quoting sources, raises many questions on the intention of Pakistan
 akhbaar ke mutabik mumbai hamale se jude jo saboot pakistan ko saunpe gaye hai wo kisi bhi karrwai ke liye naakaafi hai
 Pakistan has said this to Richard Voucher, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia of America
 pakistan ne kaha he ki kasaab ke bayaan ko saboot nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki ye bayaan jabardastee bhi ugalvaae ja sakate hai

 bhavy, jagamagaati yaa tej raftaar duvidha kya hoti he, ise samajhane ke liye bullate train main baithkar, bhimkaay baandh or parmaanu bijli ghar kii yatra kar aaie
 All three are successful but disputed children of the basic lineage
 bullate train kii metro se tulana asangat he
 There are already three generations of urban and suburban rail transport (tram - Mumbai Local - Delhi Ring Railway - Kolkata Metro)
 dilli kii metro inkaa nayaa sanskaran he
 However, riding on metro politics, even in cities where its economic success is doubtful
 bullate train bharat main antardeshiy parivahan kii niti ke liye asamanjas kii chitthee he
 This confusion is about the coordination between speed and expansion
 europe kaa vimaanan udyog bhi (1970 se 2003) raftaar kii deewangi main supersonic kancord vimaan sevaayen lekar aayaa
 The service came to a halt after the Airfrance Concorde crash in July 2000 and the aviation industry took a new turn
 ab hode raftaar kii nahin, balki vistaar kii thi
 Cheap flights to new cities started
 vimaanon kaa aakaar (airbas 380) badhaayaa gaya
 Expansion and cheaper service increased passengers and the aviation industry received supersonic wings of success
 bharat kii bullate train ko antardeshiy parivahan ke antarrashtriya prayogon ke sandarbh main dekhnaa jaruri havemerica main bullate train nahin hai
 Due to geographical vastness, railways were given preference to private vehicles and airlines for passengers focused on freight transportation
 isliye automobile or vimaanan udyog viksit hua
 European countries made railways (in some countries also high-speed rail) a means of transporting passengers and roads, according to the small geography, although cheap flights are a challenge for railways in European European voyages
 behad ghani basaavat vaale chote japan (keval 20 fisadi bhugol rahane laayak) 'shikansen' (bharat kii bullate train kaa aadhaar) ne or chota kar diya
 Japanese bullet train is very expensive for common people
 karmchaaree apni companiyon ke kharch par shinkansen ke jariye bade shaharon tak aate-jate hai
 Japan's airlines are fighting the bullet train for the market
 china ne pichley do dashakon main duniya kaa sabase bada haai speed train network (duniya se 40 fisadi kam laagat par) bana liya he lekin bullate train ke kaaran teenon sarkari vimaan sevaaon kaa munafa pigal rahaa he
 Bullet trains are heavily disputed over their cost benefit inconsistency
 china va japan sarkarein nijee jameen lene ko swatantra hai, project ko khub sabsidi bhi detii hai
 The cost of high-speed rail is high due to expensive land in Europe
 america main los angelis-san francisco or dalas-huston ke haai speed rail project jameen adhigrahan ke jhagadon or laagat badaae ke kaaran lambit hai
 We consider the bullet train to be a serious project, not an electoral exploitation, which should be the message of inland transport policy and the reorganization of railways
 1
 Railways have lost by road in the freight transport business
 railway kii dhulaai koyala, loha, cement tak simit he
 Railway business will now be run only by passenger transport
 dedicated fret (maal) coridor ko lambii duuri ke haai speed yatri parivahan coridor main badalanaa chahie jabaki purana network maal parivahan ke liye istemaal hona chahie
 Railways need a new revenue model of passenger transport that can be developed with private participation
 2
 In the last decades, there has been more investment from the railways on roads
 yahaan ab haai speed fret coridor banane kii jarurat he taaki bade trek bagaiyr ruke lambii yatra kar saken
 The automobile industry will benefit
 3
 There is an abundance of cities in India
 choti duriyon ko parivahan ko behatar sadakon or nijee vaahanon par kendrit kiya ja saktaa he
 4
 sasti vimaan sevaayen or lambii duuri kii haai speed trainen milakar antardeshiy parivahan ko aadhunik bana sakati hai
 The social and commercial responsibilities of the railways have to be separated
 saamaajik dayitvon ko bajet se vitt poshan milanaa chahie
 It is necessary to change India's inland transport policy with the bullet train
 nahin to yah mahangi (railway ke salanaa bajet kaa dhai guna) pariyojna japan ke karj se, agar ban bhi gai to yah paryatakon ke liye haai speed pales on wheels ho jaaegi
 It will not make any difference in the lives of common rail passengers
 bullate train bharat main antardeshiy parivahan kii niti ke liye asamanjas kii chitthee he

 On the statement of Governor Satyapal Malik, BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Kavinder Gupta said that the Governor is making such statements to stay in the news
 unke upar kisi tarah kaa koi dabaav nahin tha
 However, Gupta said that the reference to what the governor said was different
 ise is sambandh main nahin jodna janaa chahie
 They have spoken somewhere in the routine
 kavinder gupta ne kaha ki rajyapal ne swatantra or sanvaidhanik pad he
 The step he took to dissolve the assembly at his discretion is welcome

 i try to solve the problems when the message arrives on whatsapp too

 Malik said that Sajjad Lone was also saying that he too has enough mlas
 unke vidhayakon ko bhi dhamkaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, i did not want to be biased by giving Lone a chance
 bataa den ki jammu kashmir main bijepi ne pidipi se samarthan waapas le liya tha, jiske baad vahaan rajyapal shashan lagu he
 The tenure of the Governor's rule was going to be completed, in view of which there was a manipulation to form a government in the state
