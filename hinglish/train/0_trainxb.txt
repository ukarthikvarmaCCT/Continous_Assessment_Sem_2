 The freedom of disagreement cannot be separated from the original idea of independence because it is an integral part of it
 ek loktantric samaaj main yah swatantraaa, samanta or apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti ke adhikaar se judaa he
 The state, imposing its own terms, cannot say that everyone is free, but it is prohibited to disagree with us
 hamaare yahaan jitani bhi sarkaar ai hai, ve sab paise waalon ke hiton kii raksha karti rahi hai jisase baari asamanta faili he or un adhisankhya logon ko siyaasi numaaindgi kaa mauka hi nahin mil sakaa jo bejubaan hai
 Apparently, the dissatisfaction of those who have gone wrong, frightens the state
 jab kisi kii jameen or jangal jabaran chin liye jate hai, use ek shahari dadbe ke rahamokaram par beghar chhod diya jaataa he, tab aazaadee kii abhivyakti kaa ek hi swaroop ho saktaa he—asahmati
 Our so-called symbols of development — big dams, mines and industries — remind us of the rights that were taken away in the name of development
 system main logon kii bhagidaari, unki asahmati kaa adhikaar tathaa sarkaar kaa virodh yaa aalochana karne ke liye sanghathan banane kaa adhikaar kudarti taur par antarnihit tatv hai jo kisi bhi loktantric dhaanche ke kaam karne or tike rahane ke liye jaruri hai
 The right to disagreement and its performance in democratic forums is faltering day by day
 nafrat kii raajnneeti ne pratibandh kii raajnneeti kaa rasta taiyaar kiya he
 Even to get the rights given to us in the Constitution, we have to fight in court
 logon ko jab beaawaj parachhaaiyon main badal diya jaae, to loktantr or aazaadee kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 (based on a conversation with Ursila Ali) rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke liye spoxperson yani pravaktaaon kii khoj kii prakriya main puche gaye sawaalon se congress ke bheetar chal rahi khemebaaji sabake saamne aa gai he
 Priyanka Chaturvedi, the national spokesperson at the state Congress headquarters, created a stir in the state Congress politics with the questions asked by the candidates
 priyanka chaturvedi ne kai ummidavaaron se poocha ki rajasthan main ashok gahalot or sachin payalat main se behatar netaa koun he
 While many candidates appeared uncomfortable in answering these questions, many told about the strengths and shortcomings of both the leaders according to their choice
 khaastaur par media ke saamne in sawaalon ke aane ke baad rajasthan congress ke aalaa netaa naakhush dikhaai die
 In fact, the Congress is preparing a whole team of spokespersons, panelists and other experts in Rajasthan for the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 isi ke tahat jaipur main congress ke rashtriya pravaktaa or media cell kii sanyojak chaturvedi ne intervyuu liye
 Earlier in January, AICC secretary and media in-charge Rohan Gupta and AICC social media in-charge Pranav Shah interviewed about 560 experts
 unheen main se ab 60-70 visheshgyon kii chantni kar unako intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 In the interview held at PCC Headquarters, about the policies, history, leadership of Rahul Gandhi, opinion on the issue of BJP declaring Congress as Muslim party, and about the candidates' own election and general knowledge, including the future of Congress in Rajasthan 
 Questions were asked
 chunaavon ke kai tiimon kaa gathanabataya ja rahaa he ki vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav main media management ke liye kai tiimon kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Apart from the selected leaders of the Congress, they will also include expert professionals, doctors, lawyers, engineers and journalists
 rajasthan main congress ke pravaktaaon ke liye jin 60 se 70 logon ko bulaayaa gaya, unamem paanch se saat kii pradesh pravaktaa ke taur par niyukti kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, 10 to 15 panelists, 5 to 7 media coordinators and half a dozen RTI activists will be appointed
 iske alaava chunaav ke maddenjar sambhag str par bhi pravaktaaon kaa chayan hoga
 Attacked BJP: In the press conference held at the Congress headquarters, the Congress national spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi attacked the BJP fiercely while answering the questions of journalists
 unhone kaha pichley 4 saalon main bhaajapa ne desh kii janata ko gumraah karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Has not fulfilled any promise made to the people of the country
 rajasthan sahit desh main jahaan bhi bhaajapa kii sarkarein hai vahaan bheedtantr ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 But the public has now understood the drama of the BJP and will answer it in the 2018 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha Elections
 basapa netaa kii ore se rahul gandhi ko videshi kahin jane ke sawaal par priyanka chaturvedi ne kaha ki rahul gandhi narendra modi se bhi zyada bhartiya hai
 Hence, no one has the right to raise questions

 Consider the ten practice matches played between September 13 to 17 between the different teams participating in the tournament, except for a few matches where most of the fast or medium pace bowlers dominated
 in maichon main tej gendbaajon ne 75 to spinneron ne 35 wicket liye
 Most teams, including India, showed greater confidence in the fast bowlers rather than their spinners
 bharat ne apane donon abhyaas maichon main teen tej gendbaajon or do spinneron kaa upyog kiya
 In the match against Sri Lanka, fast bowler Irfan Pathan took five wickets and Laxmipathy Balaji took three wickets but it was not effective against Pakistan in which off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took four wickets
 australia kaa spin vibhaag main puraa daaromadar leg spinner bread hogg par tikaa he
 He has not disappointed the team by performing well so far but Australia have kept four fast bowlers in their attack
 yahi sthiti dakshin africa kii he jisane robin petersan ke rup main ekmaatr spinner rakhaa he
 Dale Steyn played a key role in South Africa's win over New Zealand
 unhone is match main 25 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 He was well supported by Albie Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe
 tippaniyan Rangana Herath is the responsibility of hosts Sri Lanka's spin department but captain Mahela Jayawardene hinted in the practice matches that he would be more confident of his fast bowlers Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga and Tisara Perera
 westeindies ko jarur sunil narayan se karishmai pradarshan kii ummid he lekin abhyaas maichon main uske gendbaajon ne jo aath wicket liye unamem se chah tej gendbaajon ke khate main gaye
 Fidel Edwards, Ravi Rampal and captain Darren Sammy are his fast bowling trinity who are likely to play in every match
 pakistan ke paas said ajmal, shahid afridi or mohammad hafeez ke rup main upyogi spinner hai jo yahaan safal ho sakate hai lekin umr gul ab bhi team ke match vijeta gendbaaj hai
 In the practice match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Irish spinner Alex Cusack took three wickets for six runs in three overs and played a key role in his team's victory but it should not be forgotten that the 13 wickets that fell in this match were ten wickets fast and medium
 The pace bowlers took it
 toornament main bhaag lene vaali vibhinn tiimon ke bich 13 se 17 sitambar tak khele gaye das abhyaas maichon par gaur karen to kuch maichon ko chhodkar adhiktar main tej yaa madhyam gati ke gendbaajon kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 In these matches, the fast bowlers took 75 wickets and the spinners took 35 wickets
 bharat sahit adhiktar tiimon ne apane spinneron ke bajaay tej gendbaajon par adhik bharosa dikhaaya
 India used three fast bowlers and two spinners in both their practice matches
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main tej gendbaaj irfan pathan ne paanch or lakshmipathi balaji ne teen wicket liye lekin pakistan ke khilaaf ye prabhavi nahin rahe jisamen of spinner ravichandran aswin ne chaar wicket hasil kiye
 The entire leg-spinner in Australia's spin department rests on Brad Hogg
 unhone abhi tak acha pradarshan karke team ko niraash nahin kiya lekin australia ne apane akraman main chaar tej gendbaaj rakhe hai
 It is the same situation for South Africa that has retained the only spinner as Robin Peterson
 dakshin africa kii newjiland par jeet main del sten ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He took four wickets for 25 runs in this match
 unhen albi morkal or lonawabo sotsobe kaa acha sahyog mila

 The West Indies certainly expect a charismatic performance from Sunil Narine but six of the eight wickets his bowlers took in practice matches went to the account of the fast bowlers

 Pakistan have useful spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez who can be successful here but Umar Gul is still the match-winning bowler of the team

 As soon as the terrorists fired, the CRPF retaliated and killed both the terrorists
 siarpief ke mutabik unke paas aisa input nahin tha ki aatanki pampor yaa bijabehada main suraksha balon par hamalaa karne vaale hai, haa unke paas aisa input tha ki aatanki surakshabalon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai, lekin kahaan, isaki pakki soochna nahin thi
 Taking a lesson from this incident, the CRPF is now going to take a bus which will have bullet proof plate

 The terrorists got out of a car and started firing

 Kamakhya Shaktipeeth is said to be the best of all the Shaktipeeths of Mata
 mata sati ke prati bhagwaan shiv kaa moh bhang karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne apane sudarshan chakra se mata sati ke mrit sharir ke 51 bhaag kiye the
 The places where the body parts of Sati fell are called Shaktipeeth
 kaha jaataa he ki yahaan par mata sati kaa guhva matlab yoni bhaag gira tha, usee se kamakhya mahapith kii utpatti hui
 It is said that due to being the vaginal part of the goddess, the mother menstruates here
 kamakhya shaktipeeth chamatkaaron or rochak tathyon se bharaa hua he
 Know here 6 interesting facts related to Kamakhya Shaktipeeth: 1
 mandir main nahin he devi kii murti:is mandir main devi kii koi murti nahin he, yahaan par devi ke yoni bhaag kii hi puja kii jaati he
 There is a pool in the temple, which is always covered with flowers
 is jagah ke paas main hi ek mandir he jahaan par devi kii murti sthapit he
 This Peeth is considered to be the Mahapeeth of all the Peeth of the Mother
 2
 Mata is here every year Rajswala: a very interesting story about this back is famous
 kaha jaataa he ki is jagah par maa kaa yoni bhaag gira tha, jis vajah se yahaan par mata har saal teen dinon ke liye rajaswala hoti hai
 During this time the temple is closed
 teen dinon ke baad mandir ko bahut hi utsaah ke saath kholaa jaataa he
 3
 prasad ke rup main miltaa he geela vastra:yahaan par bhakton ko prasad ke rup main ek geela kapadaa diya jaataa he, jise ambuvachi vastra kehete hai
 It is said that white cloth is spread around the statue during the deity of the goddess
 teen din baad jab mandir ke daravaaje khole jate hai, tab vah vastra mata ke raj se laal rang se bhigaa hota he
 Later this garment is distributed among the devotees as Prasad
 4
 The original temple has disappeared: According to the legend, there was a demon named Hell at one time
 narak ne kamakhya devi ke saamne vivaah karne kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Devi did not want to marry him, so they placed a condition in front of hell
 shart yah thi ki agar narak ek raat main hi is jagah par maarg, ghat, mandir aadi sab banavaa de, to devi usase vivaah kar lengi
 Hell summoned Lord Vishwakarma to fulfill the condition and started work
 kaam puraa hota dekh devi ne raat khatm hone se pehle hi murge ke dwaara subah hone kii soochna dilava di or vivaah nahin ho paaya
 Even today, the path leading from the bottom of the mountain is known as Narakasura Marg and the temple where the idol of Mother is installed is called Kamadeva Temple
 mandir ke sambandh main kaha jaataa he ki nirkasur ke atyaacharon se kamakhya ke darshan main kai pareshaaniyaan utpann hone lagi thim, jis baat se krodhit hokar maharishi vashisht ne is jagah ko shraap de diya
 Kamakhya Peeth is said to have disappeared over time due to the curse
 5
 The history of the temple is associated with the 16th century: According to beliefs, it is said that in the 16th century, there were wars in the kingdoms of Kamarup Pradesh, in which King Vishwasinh of the princely state of Cooch Behar won
 yuddh main vishwa singh ke bhai kho gaye the or apane bhai ko dhundne ke liye ve ghumat-ghoomte nilanchal parvat par pahunch gaye
 There he saw an older woman
 us mahila ne raja ko is jagah ke mahatv or yahaan kamakhya peeth hone ke bare main bataaya
 Knowing this, the king started digging this place
 khudaai karne par kaamdev kaa banawaye hue mul mandir kaa nichalaa hissaa baahar niklaa
 The king built a new temple on top of the same temple
 kaha jaataa he ki 1564 main muslim akramanakariyon ne mandir ko tod diya tha
 The next year, it was rebuilt by Naranarayana, son of King Vishwasinh
 6
 Kamakhya Yatra is incomplete without Bhairava's darshan: At some distance from Kamakhya temple is the temple of Umananda Bhairav, Umananda Bhairav is the Bhairava of this Shaktipeeth
 yah mandir brahmaputra nadi ke bich main he
 It is said that without his visit, the journey of Kamakhya Devi is considered incomplete
 kamakhya mandir kii yatra ko puraa karne ke liye or apni sari manokamanaayen puri karne ke liye kamakhya devi ke baad umanand bhairav ke darshan karnaa anirvaay he

 dilli se sate gautamabuddhanagar ke greater noida main maa-bahan kii hatya karne vaale naaballig bete ko police ne dhund nikaala he
 Police recovered the deceased Anjali's absconding 15-year-old son from Varanasi
 aaropee betaa aaj hatya kii manshaa, hatya ke tareeke or kisi tarah kii sajeesh ke bare main ahm khulaasa kar saktaa he
 The boy told during interrogation that he was 1 from home
 5 lakh rupye lekar gaya tha, lekin rupee train main bag samet chori ho gaye
 The boy confesses to murder, but says he does not know why he killed his mother and sister
 game ko lekar police kaa kahana he ki is game main task hota he ki aapako krime karke police se bachanaa hota he
 But in this case, the boy himself called and informed the father about his being in Varanasi
 maa-beti kii hatya ke baad se hi laapata hone se naaballig betaa pehle se hi shaq ke ghere main aa gaya tha
 But now the important question in front of the police is that between three days between reaching Varanasi, where did he go, met whom, and from whose number did he call his father from Varanasi
 greater noida se varanasi tak kaise pahunchaa ye kahani baad main, pehle suniye puure ensiaar ko tharrane vaale murder cese kii sachai
 The minor son was suspected of killing his mother and sister when the mother-daughter corpse was lying at home and the son was missing from the house
 ghar main na to baahar se ghusane ke nishaan the, na lutpaat ke nishaan or na hi koi keemtee cheez gaayab thi
 Only two corpses and a third member living in the house are missing
 lekin kisi bhi daawey se pehle bete kaa milanaa jaruri tha
 Therefore, the most important link for the police in this case is the son
 police ne ghar se sisitivi footage bhi baraamad kiye hai
 The accused son was last seen in these CCTV footage
 pehle raat 8 bajkar 16 minute par maa or bahan ke saath bazaar se ghar aate hue lift ke andar dikhataa he
 Then leaving the house in the same lift at 11:15 pm
 lekin is baar uske kapade badale hue hai
 There is backpack and mobile phone in hand
 inhen teen ghanton ke andar maa-beti kii hatya kii gai
 But the accused son's expressions are not indicating that he has left the house after committing two murders
 vah aaraam se lift se nikal kar baahar jaataa he or ek guard se haath milakar gaadi main baithkar nikal jaataa he
 There is no fear, no panic or wrinkle
 yakeen kar paanaa to mushkil he ki mahaj mobile game na khilne dene par betaa apni maa or bahan kii jaan le saktaa he
 But what can the children of this age wandering in the dark maze and unfathomable depths of the Internet, have told us the Blue Whale game
 kaha ja rahaa he ki greater noida ke is sansanikhej dohare hatyakand kii script bhi aise hi game main likhi hui thi
 However, this internet game named High School Gangster is supposed to incite someone to such violence, the police suspects it
 police ko aas pados or skool se poochtacha ke dauran yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki aaropee gussell vyavhaar vaala he or choti choti baton par bhi kai baar jhagade kar chukaa he
 But can this anger be so poisonous that it takes the life of its mother and sister, that too after beating the bat
 koi yakeen nahin kar paa rahaa he, na parivaar na aas pados or na hi police
 After the arrest of the accused son and confession of his crime, the murder of mother-daughter in Greater Noida seems to be solved
 usne poochtacha main apni maa or bahan ke katl kii baat kabool kar lee he
 On Friday night, police recovered Anjali's son who was absconding since the incident from Varanasi
 police ne bataaya ki bachche kii uske mobile ke aadhaar par last lokation pahadganj thi
 From Paharganj, he then took the train and went to Mughalsarai
 vahaan se usne shuukravaar kii subah kisi ke phone se apane pita ko phone kiya
 The father immediately informed the police
 iske baad ek police team fouran hawaii jahaaj se varanasi ke liye ravaanaa hui
 On Friday afternoon, the child called his father again from another person's phone
 jis number se phone kiya us par police ne kol kar phone ke maalik ko bataaya ki is ladke kii talash kii ja rahi he, us par najar rakhen or police ko lokation bataaen
 With the help of the person, Noida police caught the child walking near Dashashwamedh Ghat
 us vakt baccha puri tarah normal tha
 The police also recovered the mobile of the deceased Anjali from the child
 pakad main aane ke baad jab police ne ladke se poochtacha kii to usne apni maa or bahan ke katl kii baat kabool kar lee
 At the same time, the father of the accused child told that he was called by his son from Mughalsarai, which he immediately informed the police and the police managed to find him
 patni-beti kii maut se dukhi aaropee bachche ke pita ne kaha ki vah abhi zyada kuch bolne kii sthiti main nahin hai or bete se baat karne ke baad hi kuch bataa paaenge
 According to Noida police sources, the child had both slaughtered
 police ke mutabik katl karne kii vajah krime fiter game ko bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, the boy had beaten both of them with a bat
 ab police shanivaar ko use lekar noida aa rahi he
 Earlier in the evening, Noida SSP Luv Kumar told 'aaj Tak' that after questioning the family, friends, people of the deceased and the staff and students in the school, it was found that Anjali's son was of an aggressive attitude
 use gussa zyada aata he
 Through his social media, he was being searched all over the country including every railway station, metro station, bus stand and NCR
 gauratlab he ki beete mangalvaar kii raat greater noida ke gaur city tu ke tower ji ke flats number 1446 main lage taale ko jab todaa gaya to usamen khun se sani maa-beti kii laash mili thi
 Both were brutally murdered by the viewer
 jab ye vaardaat hui to ghar main kul teen log the
 Mother, daughter and son
 magar daravaaza khulaa to laash sirf maa or beti kii mili betaa gaayab tha
 a bat was found lying near both the corpses, with marks of blood on it
 police ko maukey se ek dhardaar hathiyaar bhi mila tha
 But if not found then 15 year old son
 tab tak to aisa hi lag rahaa tha ki jaise kisi ne maa-beti kii hatya kii or bete ko kidanap kar liya he
 Actually that flat belongs to the Aggarwal family
 jinka tiles kaa kaarobaar he
 From the evening of the 4th, the family members were trying to contact the mother and children present in the house, but when there was no contact for several hours, they contacted the relatives living near the house
 jab rishtedaar ghar pahunche
 The flat was closed from outside and the newspaper was lying outside
 unhone khidki tod kar andar jhaanka to unhen maa anjali or beti kii laash najar ai, jiske paas police ko soochna di gai thi
 The boy's maternal uncle also appealed to the media during the conversation that such mobile games should be stopped, so that someone's life is lost

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne rahul gandhi ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya par die gayi vivaadit bayaan par supreme court se mili fatkaar kaa swaagat kiya he
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi had said in an election rally on March 6 in Sonale, Maharashtra that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had killed Gandhiji
 iske baad sangh kii bhiwandi ikai ke sachiv rajesh kunte ne congress upaadhyaksh ke khilaaf manahani kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 RSS spokesman Manmohan Vaidya has issued a statement saying that the Supreme Court of the country has uncovered the reality of the lies and factless propaganda of the Congress party
 vahiin is maamle main supreme court ne rahul gandhi se kaha ki yaa to vah apane vivaadit bayaan parmaafee maange yaa phir trial phase karen
 The court said clearly, "if you do not apologize, you will have to face trial
 'is puure maamle main supreme court ne kaha ki jab aap kisi vyakti yaa sanstha ke bare main bolte hai to aapako satark rahanaa chahie
 The Supreme Court said that Nathuram Godse killed Gandhiji and the people of RSS killed Gandhiji, there is a lot of difference between these two things
 supreme court main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii yachika par sunwaayee ho rahi thi to rahul gandhi ne apane khilaaf maharashtra kii ek nichali adaalat chal rahe aapraadhik manahani se jude ek maamle ko radd karne kii maang kii he
 The next hearing of the case will be on 27 July
 rahul gandhi ko court kii fatkaar ke baad sangh ko lagata he ki mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko aresas se jodakar virdohi hameshaa mahatma gandhi ke liye sangh ko doshi tehraate rahe hai, unki bolti band ho jaayegi
 Despite all this, the Sangh cannot possibly deny that Nathuram Godse has been the Sangh's volunteer

 The Department of Telecom has approved the rules of net neutrality
 in niyamon main mote taur par ye he ki internet blocking, kisi khaas website ke liye net speed kam yaa zyada karnaa yaa phir jiro reating internet data shaamil he
 No such telecom provider can do such things now
 gauratlab he ki telecom regulatary athurity of india (TRAI) ne pichley saal hi sarkaar ko ek fremawork diya tha
 This framework of Net Neutrality came after the long-running Net Neutrality Campaign in India
 net neutrality ko lekar bharat main campan main teji tab shuru hui jab fasebuk internet oarji lekar aane kii taiyaari main tha
 Under this, there was a provision to provide free internet for a particular service
 bharat main iskaa jam kar virodh hua or is vajah se fasebuk ko apane kadam peeche khinchne pade
 According to the report, in this new rule it is clearly written that there can be no discrimination in any way with the Internet Koller data
 isamen blocking, speed kam karnaa yaa kisi khaas contant ke liye zyada speed dene ko bain kiya gaya he
 However, the Internet of Things iot service and other special services have been kept separate
 isamen autonomas whical or surgery oparations shaamil hai
 a report by The Wire stated that trai's head R
 es
 Sharma has compared it to an ambulance and said that the ambulance may be violating traffic rules at least to ensure that the service quality remains intact
 internet sarvice prowiders ko ab department of telecom ke saath qaraar karte vakt in sharton ko maananaa hoga or license agreement ke samay bhi is par sin karnaa hoga
 According to the report, if any Internet service provider violates this rule, his license can be canceled
 ET Telecom kii report ke mutabik telecom secreretary aruna sundarrajan ne kaha he, ‘TRAI kii taraf se net neutrality par die gaye sabhi siforishein sweekaar kar lee gai hai
 The principle will be followed except for some special services
 Learn about 'net Neutrality'
 If you do not know about Net Neutrality, then tell that it is a principal under which any Internet Service Provider has been decided All customers will not discriminate in content
 aapako bataa den ki net neutrality na hone kaa sidhaa asar ek yujar ko padataa he
 Because those companies who have contracted with internet service will only open their content faster to the user, whereas those who have not signed up with the service provider can open their content slow
 yah ek badi samasya ho sakati he agar net neutrality na ho to
 Significantly, the term net neutrality was first used by Team Wu, a professor of media law at Columbia University
 is principal ke mutabik koi bhi sarvice prowider internet ke kisi bhi contant, data or aplications ko barabari kaa darja degi
 No website and page should be blocked unless there is an unlawful fact on it
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki choti-badi sari website ko internet samaan rup se jagah degi
 TRAI in its recommendation to this government had said, 'internet service should follow the principle that there is no discrimination or different attitude towards any content
 isamen kisi khaas sarvice ke liye internet ko slo karnaa yaa phir kisi contant ko block karnaa shaamil he
 TRAI has said that service providers and mobile telecom operators should not compromise on things like content discrimination

 ek kam gyaat tathy yah he ki unhone gujarat se aatankwaadiyon ke khatme se judi ahm jimmedaariyaan alpsankhyak varg se aane vaale police adhikariyon ko saunpi thi
 The challenges he now faces as Union Home Minister are formidable
 unamem se sabase badi samasya jammu-kashmir kii he jo pichley ek saal se raashtrapati shashan or baad main rajyapal shashan ke adheen he
 The first challenge is to conduct the Amarnath Yatra peacefully from July 1 to August 15
 87 sadasyeey jammu-kashmir vidhansabha kaa chunaav yatra sampann hone ke baad hi karaayaa jayega
 It is difficult to keep the promise of repealing Article 370 and Article 35 made in the BJP manifesto
 maujuuda kanoon ke tahat sarkaar ko anuchhed 370 ko nirast karne ke liye ek nai jammu-kashmir samvidhan sabha kaa phir se gathan karnaa hoga or unhen anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne ke liye saath laane kii jarurat hogi
 Solving the clutches of Ayodhya, the construction of the Ram temple and the implementation of the National Citizenship Register in Assam are also major challenges
 unhen assam or purvottar ke logon ko vivaadaaspad naagarikta vidheyak 2018 ko sweekaar karne ke liye raji karnaa he, jo padosi deshon se hindu, sikh, isai or buddha sharnaarthiyon ko sweekaar karne kii anumati detaa he lekin musalamaanon ko nahin
 The Shah's views on Jammu and Kashmir are strong
 unka maananaa he ki anuchhed 370-jo jammu-kashmir ko swaittata detaa he—use khatm kiye jane kii jarurat he
 He feels that it will be possible to do so next year after the BJP gets a majority in the Rajya Sabha and a law can be passed to end the status of the special state
 anuchhed 35e, jo rajya ke sthaayee nivaasiyon ke visheshadhikaron ko paribhaashit karata he, shah use ek kaaryakari aadesh ke madhyam se hataa dena chaahate hai
 He believes that this is bad for the state and the country as it prevents Jammu and Kashmir from full development of its potential
 unhen lagata he ki anuchhed 35e kaa makasad jammu or kashmir, vishesh rup se jammu kshetra kaa islamickaran he
 Significantly, there is talk of repealing Article 35A on the ground that this law prohibits outsiders from buying property in the state, but such restrictive laws already exist in Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim, so only Jammu and Kashmir Why is being targeted shah jammu-kashmir main ghati or jammu kshetron ke bich maujuuda 'asamanta' ko dur karne ke liye vidhansabha siton ke parisemen par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai
 Shah simply refuses to elaborate on his future strategy, saying, "when dealing with matters related to national security, the spirit of the nation will first define my perspective
 '' khud ko grih mantri banaae jane par musalamaanon kii ashankaon ke sawaal par unhone jor dekar kaha, ''main bhaajapa kii rashtravaadi vichaardhaara kaa kadai se paalan karata hum, jisane vikaas ke agenda ko lagu karne ke dauraan dharmik alpsankhyakon ke saath kabhi bhedbhaav nahin kiya he
 Those who are not against the nation need not fear me or the BJP, irrespective of their religion
 ''ek anya prashn ke uttar main ve kehete hai, ''yahaan tak ki (hindutv ke vichaarak) vir saavarkar alpsankhyak tushtikaran se lard rahe the, ve hinduon ke liye vishesh sahuliyaton kii maang nahin kar rahe the
 From that perspective, Savarkar was fighting a battle of equal treatment
 '' yah poochne par ki ve aadi shankaracharya, chanakya or saavarkar kii tasviren apane ghar main kyon rakhte hai, shah kehete hai, ''mujhe teenon se apaar prerana milti he
 Regarding Jammu and Kashmir, Shah says that his aim is to stop the Islamization of Jammu region, which he believes has gained momentum in the last 20 years
 ve jammu-kashmir ke teen hisson main vibhaajan ke aresas ke puraane prastaavon par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai jisamen jammu or kashmir ko do rajyon or ladakh ko centre-shasit pradesh ke rup main rakhe jane kii baat kahi gai he
 Sangh Parivar thinkers believe that this will automatically make Article 370 useless
 saath hi, is anuchhed ko nirast karne kii ranneeti par aage badaae se pehle shah ke grih mantralay ko jammu-kashmir ke aatanki network ko khatm karne kii ranneeti banani hogi
 In fact, after such drastic steps, there is this indispensable need to prevent potential violence
 aresas ke ek vichaarak kehete hai: ''agar anuchhed 370 ko darkinar karnaa he to jammu-kashmir kaa vibhaajan ek acha prastaav he
 Even Pakistan which is facing protests from local people in pok, recently segregated the gilgit-baltistan region through a legal means to prevent the protests from spreading
 bharat, jammu-kashmir ko vibhajit karte hue ek ranneetik tark ke rup main iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 "but by dividing Jammu and Kashmir into three parts, India will be accused of attempting to divide the state into a religious base - a valley of Muslims, Jammu as a Hindu and Ladakh as a Buddhist territory
" rashtriya suraksha visheshgy sushant sareen kehete hai, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki shah jammu-kashmir samasya ko paanch saal main hal kar sakate hai, lekin ve bharat kii kashmir niti main adhik gaharaai laaenge jo samasya ko hal karne kii sahi disha main badaae main madad karegi
 Clearly, the phase of wavering attitudes has been left behind
 ghati main paak samarthak tatwon se nipatane main bahut aavashyak nirmamata najar aegi
 "A former police officer who has worked in Jammu and Kashmir says:" The Modi government has prepared the ground with several actions against separatist leaders like Geelani, Yasin Malik and Mirwaiz, indicating that India is now only a valley Will only talk to the people who support India
 purv kii bhartiya sarkaron kii taraf se parade ke peeche se algaavvaadi netaaon kaa samarthan kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Now it will be over
 shah ko kashmir niti ko agle str taklekar janaa he
 "these officials say this means that relatives of the slain militants will not be allowed to carry out the funeral procession (like Israel where the government does not tell anyone about the graves of the slain terrorists)
" saath hi, khufia network ko majboot karne or ghati kii udaaravaadi islamic saanskrithik paramparaon ko protsaahit karne ke liye kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Sadhus associated with Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, the Fanshree Ram temple, and various other organizations have started an exercise to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 unamem se ek ram vilaas vedanti, pehle se hi mandir ke chaaron ore 67 acre bhoomi ko ram janmabhumi nyaas main sthanantarit karne ke liye dabaav daal rahe hai
 He is one of the main litigants of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas case
 yah bhoomi 2
 The 77 acres are separate from the disputed land where the Babri Masjid once was
 yah 67 acre jameen narsimha raav sarkaar ne 1993 main is shart par adhigrahit kii thi ki ise vivaadit bhoomi ke hinduon yaa musalamaanon ke paas jane kaa faisle aane ke baad mukt kiya jayega
 The 2010 Allahabad High Court ruling in the case said that two-thirds of the land would be given to the two Hindu litigants in the case and a third to the Sunni Muslim Waqf Board, but due to an appeal pending in the Supreme Court, the UPA The government did not take any action
 pichhali baar kii modi sarkaar bhi janvari 2019 tak chup rahi
 When the general election came to a head, it made an application to the apex court seeking permission to transfer the acquired land to the trust
 gauratlab he ki jab aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar ne muslim netritv ke saath baatcheet ke jariye is mudde ko sulajhane ke prayaas shuru kiye the to aresas or shah ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki is mudde ko adaalat ke madhyam se hal kiya janaa chahie
 The Ram temple is probably an issue where Shah and the Sangh Parivar are on one side and Modi on the other
 pradhanmantri kathith taur par bhavishya main behatar hindu-muslim sambandhon kii ummid main baatcheet ke madhyam se is mudde ko hal karnaa chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Shah and RSS are in favor of a strict policy on the issue of Ram temple as they believe that this is the only right way to deal with the radical elements present in the Muslim community
 anya chunautiyampichley paanch varshon ke dauraan maowad peedit jilon kii sankhya 126 se ghatakar 90 ho gai he or modi sarkaar or purv kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh kii nitiyon ne isamen badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 The Modi government went a step further and began to tighten its grip on the so-called 'urban Naxalites'
 sarkaar ne un vampanthi buddhijiviyon ko shahari naksali qaraar diya jinke bare main sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki bhumigat maovadiyon ke updrav inhen buddhijiviyon kii vaicharik prerana kii upaj hai
 One important security issue, on which the Modi government showed an unnaturally weak will, is the issue of police reforms
 police sudhaar kaa khaakaa seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ke purv mahanideshak prakaash singh ne taiyaar kiya tha, jinhone ise kanoonee rup se sweekrut banane ke liye sarvocch nyaayalay tak kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Prakash Singh says that the Modi government has done nothing to improve the police system
 unhone jo suzav die hai unamem, polisbal ke aadharbhoot dhaanche ko majboot karne (janashakti, parivahan, sanchaar or forencik sahaayta ke rup main) har rajya main andhra pradesh kii tarah vishesh police ikaayiyon ke nirmaan, sibiai ko ek kanoonee manyata dene taaki vah rajanetaaon kaa mohara nahin ban sake, sangathit aparaadh ko niyantrit karne ke liye macoka (maharashtra niyantran sangathit aparaadh adhinium, 1999) kii tarah ek vishesh akhil bhartiya kanoon or police ko rajya suchi se samavarti suchi main daalana taaki rajya ke polisbal ko viksit karne main centre kii bhi kuch bhoomika rahe, sahit paanch pramukh sudhaaron kii sifarish karata he
 Certainly, with the arrival of Shah, a new chapter of strict nationalism has started in India's internal security sector
 lekin chunautiyaan bhi kai hai
 The ministry has several schemes under consideration or incomplete, such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS) and Natgrid or the National Intelligence Grid database
 ye aatankwaadiyon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane or police balon ke bich khufia jaankaree saajha karne ke liye bahut zyada mahatvapurn hai
 Amit Shah must have seen his roles clearly
 aane vaale dinon main nattejey sabko dikhenge
 Khasamkhas leader of BSP supremo Mayawati and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra rejected the possibility of an electoral settlement with the Congress
 mishra ne tisare morche kaa bhi majaak banaate hue kaha ki kisi ko apane number pataa nahin hai, phir bhi atakalein lagane main lage hai
 The BSP leader made it clear that his party will contest alone all the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the country and there will be no political coordination with any party
 mishra ke mutabik is bare main jo bhi idhar-udhar kii baaten kahi ja rahi hai, un sabaki hawa 15 janvari ko mayawati kii raily ke baad nikal jaaegi
 Significantly, this rally is being held in Lucknow on the day of Mayawati's birthday
 main nahin mila hum sonia gandhi songreji akhbaar ‘indian express’ se baat karte hue satish chandra mishra ne bispi kii raajnneetik ranneeti ke bare main baat kii
 He said that i often read the news that i am meeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi in connection with the alliance with Congress before the Lok Sabha elections in UP
 lekin in sabamein koi sachai nahin he
 The BSP will contest elections on its own, not only in UP but in the entire country
 sapa-congress dangon ke liye jimmedaarcongress netaaon ke is tark par ki agar bispi kaa dalit vot bank or congress kaa muslim vot bank saath aa jaae, to ajey ho jayega, satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki musalmaan puri tarah se bispi ke saath hai
 According to him, not a single riot took place during Mayawati's CM
 sapa raaj main dange ho rahe hai or centre main baithi congress kuch nahin kar rahi he
 In such a situation, on what basis can these political parties claim influence over minorities
 modi kaa upi main koi asar nahinarendra modi ke upi main asar ko puri tarah khaarij karte hue satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki abhi to bijepi kii aapasi sir footwwal hi khatm nahin hui he
 Mishra said on Rahul Gandhi that what happened to his political charisma is clear from the results of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 numbers kaa pataa nahin, baat tisare morche kitisare morche or isamen bispi kii sambhavit bhoomika ko sire se khaarij karte hue satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki yah ek joke he
 It is not yet known how many mps will be able to become from which party
 aise main kisi bhi tarah ke guna bhaag kaa kya matlab he
 Malawat Poorna launched the first poster of his biopic film on Mount Kilimanjaro, South Africa's highest peak
 mount kilimanjaro kii chadhaai main purna ke saath unke trainer or 17 anya ladakiyon kaa dal tha jo 15 agast ko mount kilimanjaro summit ke liye nikle the
 On the evening of India's Independence Day, Poorna hoisted the flag here and released the first poster of his film from 19 thousand 3 hundred 41 feet
 'purna' film ke nirmaataaon ne iskaa first luk ko jari karne ke liye unic marketing plan banaaya jiske liye unhone dakshin africa ke kilimenzaro chotii par 15 agast 2016 summit kaa sahaara liya or uskaa phase purna khud baniin
 On 10 August, Malavat Poorna started his journey, together he kept two waterproof posters of the film
 purna ne apni chadhaai 15 agast ko puri kii or isi ke saath hi unhone poster bhi vahiin se launch kiya
 This is the first time in the history of world cinema when the first look of a film has been launched so high
 purna, rahul bose ke production or diarection main bani film he, jisane pramotion ke maamle main anya filmon ke saamne nayaa benchmark sthapit kar diya he
 Rahub Bose says, 'when we heard that Poorna is going to the top of Kilimanjaro for the August 15 summit, then why should i think of Idea Souza, who should launch the first look of his biopic film from there itself
 maine iske bare main kru ke sabhi logon se charchaa kii or sabhi ne jhat se is creative idia ke liye haa kar diya
 If you ask me how it happened, then i will say that a little luck and a little creative idea has done its job
 'purna, telugana kii ek aisi ladki kii kahani he jisane 13 varsh kii umr main hi 25 may 2014 ko duniya kii sabase oonchi chotii mount averest fatah kiya tha
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that till the problem of silt from the Ganges in Bihar will not be overcome, the vision of PM Modi's Namami Gange cannot be fulfilled
 
 Cleanliness of Ganga is dependent on its scarcity
 farkka baandh ko tod de sarkarbihar main ganga ke badhate jalastr or usase machi tabaahi par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh se phone par baatcheet kii
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar urged the Home Minister to send experts whose minds are fully open to study Ganges in Bihar
 mukhyamantri kaa spasht taur par maananaa he ki bihar main ganga kaa jo haal hua he uski vajah he farkka baandh
 Due to freezing of silt in the Ganges, the water level in the Ganges rises and spreads to the surrounding area
 unhone grih mantri rajnath singh se ye bhi kaha ki farkka baandh ko tod dena hi samasya kaa samaadhaan he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that for the last 10-15 years, i have been raising the issue of the plight of the Ganges in Bihar in front of the Center, but the central government is that it does not even take the name of hearing
 centre main manmohan singh kii sarkaar ho yaa phir narendra modi kii sarkaar, ganga kii durdasha ko lekar lagaataar aawaaj uthati rahi he
 But the solution to the problem was not even discussed
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main jab pawan bansal jal sansaadhan sachiv the us vakt bhi unhone farkka baandh todane kii baat kahi thi
 Attacking the first full railway budget of the bjp-led NDA government, the Opposition on Thursday said it lacked vision and questioned "how will the government implement such good ideas"? loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge or trinmul congress ke dinesh trivedi ne bajet kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki isamen thos kuch nahin he or khaali ‘‘sapane dikhaae gaye hai
 Both have been former railway ministers
 khadge ne sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘yah badhiya lachchhedaar bajet bhaashan he
 But no view has been presented as to how the Railway Minister will achieve these goals
 mantri ne kaha he ki vah pipipi model, bioti samjhaute aadi apanaayenge
 If you are dependent on others then there is less chance that you will be able to meet your goals
 ’’ On the other hand, Trivedi, who has been praising the NDA government since moving away from the party line many times, also expressed disappointment over the railway budget and said that he has woven dreams for the people but how to make them come true, it is not clear he said, "it is something It is like saying that i will go to the moon
 yah ek vichaar he, ek sapana lekin mahatvapurn yah he ki aap vahaan tak pahunchenge kaise? ye sab bhavishya kii baat kii gayi he lekin aapaki maujuuda mali haalat main to 50 fisadi kii giravat he
 How will you bridge this gap? ’’ Trivedi said, "I see that the railway is on its way to Air India
 iskaa khajaana khaali he
 '' samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne rail bajet kii saraahna karte hue kaha ki isamen nai railgadiyon kii ghoshnaa jaise loklubhaavan upayon se bachaa gaya he or railway mantri suresh prabhu ne pichley bajet main shuru kii gai pariyojnaon ko puraa karne par dhyaan dekar acha kadam uthaaya he
 Mulayam said, "good job done
 prabhu ne nai yojanaon kaa elaan nahin kiya or pichley upayon ko amali jama pehanaane par jor dene kii baat kahi
 If he succeeds in doing so, it will be a great achievement
 ’’ The ruling NDA ally Shiv Sena, while expressing "complete dissatisfaction" with the Railway Budget, said that it lacked clarity and did not specify where the funding for various projects would come from
 
 Senior Shiv Sena leader and MP from North West Mumbai Gajanan Kirtikar said, "we are completely dissatisfied with the budget
 unhone bajet main bahut si baaten kahi hai
 But where will the money come from? ”he also said that the budget has kept everyone in“ darkness ”
 kirtikar ne kaha, ‘‘railmantri platformon kii oonchai badhaane kii baat kar rahe hai jiske liye 97 karod rupee kii jarurat he
 If they are to be completed, then funds have to be allocated for these projects in one go
 ve linon ke doharikaran or tiharikaran kii baat kar rahe hai lekin ve kin linon par kaam karenge? unhone hamen andhere main rakhaa he
 '' shivasena ke hi ek anya varisht netaa chandrakant khare ne kataaksh karte hue kaha, ‘‘bajet acha he lekin samajhane main mushkil he
 '' sansadeey kaary mantri em venkaiya naidu ne rail bajet par vipaksh kii in aalochanaon ko khaarij kiya ki isamen koi tatv kii baat nahin he
 Describing it as "real and factual", he said that the NDA government has taken all the responsibility to fulfill the unfinished promises of the tenure of the previous governments
 kisi nai train kii ghoshnaa nahin kiye jane kii vipaksh kii aalochana par naidu ne sawaal kiya ki ateet main ghoshit kii gai kitniin nai trainon or nai rail linon ke vaadon ko puraa kiya gaya he? unhone kaha ki yah bajet nishchit rup se rail yatriyon ke liye ‘‘gati, suraksha, sangraksha or santosh ko sunishchit karne vaala he
 '' khare ne kaha, ‘‘log hamase puuchhenge ki kshetra ko bajet se kya mila? ab bajet padhanaa padegaa or uske baad hi kuch bataaya jayega
 Senior Biju Janata Dal leader Tathagata Satpathy also criticized the railway budget as hollow and disappointing
 unhone kaha ki vah is bajet ko das main se sirf do number denge
 He said, "it is completely hollow
" prabhu ne ek vichaar rakhaa lekin usamen kuch tatv kii baat nahin he

 vahaan unki nazren ek mohatarama se mili or consteble sahab clin bold ho gaye
 In just an hour's journey, that beautiful lady made the constable such that she would not forget this journey throughout her life
 darasal, us sundari ne dil dene kaa aisa swang rachaa ki consteble sahab uske jaal main funskar 70 hajaar rupee gavaa baithe

 The girl created such a love-drama that the constable's heart fell on her

 It is said that after landing at the Jehanabad station, the girl spoke to the constable to get the gift as the first sign of love

 aglaa daur centre va rajyon ke bich khule takaraav kaa he jo mandi kii aag main petrol daalega
 Appreciate the Opposition's Navodaya, but only a year and a half (march, 2018 to November, 2019) India's political map is more or less pre-2014 when the ruling party at the center was limited to a few states while the opposition was scattered all over India 
 maharashtra main nai sarkaar ke baad desh ke sirf 40 fisad hisse par bhaajapa yaa sahyogi dalon kaa shashan he jo disambar 2017 main 71 fisad par tha
 Though despite the bjp's rule in the entire country, the most stubborn recession took us, but the new chemistry of the relations between the Center and the state will now increase the policy challenge
 aarthik vikaas main rajyon kii bhoomika centre se zyada kendriya ho chuki he
 The 12 states with high growth rate are responsible for lifting India out of recession
 goa, chandigarh, dilli, puduccheri, haryana, maharashtra, gujarat, kerala, himachal, tamilnadu, punjab or uttarakhand aaj desh kaa 50 fisad jidipi or kareeb 58 fisad upabhoktaaon kii mejabani karte hai
 After this, the second category is of big and potential states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha

 When many states have to take the lead in recovering from the recession, their financial health is disastrous

 The states' total earnings declined by about two per cent in the first quarter of the year

 According to the latest ICRA report, the market debt of all states in the first half of this year has increased by about 43% compared to the same period last year
 rajyon kii buree haalat bataa rahi he ki• sarkarein ab nae tex lagaayengi jo jameen kii kharid -farokht, vaahan panjikaran jaisi sevaaon par honge jo jieesti ke baahar hai

 Fresh losses of power companies 1
 35 lakh karod rupye ke aasapaas he
 Rates have been increased in some states while others are going to increase
 • Despite raising taxes, states will have to raise debt on a large scale as the revenue from the center will decrease
 yah ek dushchakr kii shuruyaat he kyonki rajyon kaa bada karj darasal pichley karj ko chukaane main jaataa he• arthvyavastha main sabase zyada maang rajyon ke kharch se aati he
 Spending in the first quarter of the year did not increase at all, with 18 states accounting for nearly 91 per cent of the state's expenditure in the entire economy, when it was most needed to overcome the recession
 inkaa puunji kharch kam hua jo maang badhaane ke liye jaruri he
 • Between 2012 and 2017, five major states (karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Chhattisgarh) achieved rapid growth by limiting losses, while four states recorded higher growth with higher losses
 ab zyaadaatar rajya oonche ghate or nichali growth ke dushchakr main funs sakate hai
 The budgets of the Center and the states are no longer in a position to give the economy heavy expenditure or low tax vitamins
 desh kaa nayaa rajnatik nakshaa jiesti ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 This ambitious tax will not be a thing without reform in tax reform
 petro utpaadon, achal sampattiv ko jiesti ke daayre main laane, kar dhaanche ko chust karne or niyamon kaa anupaalan karne ke liye jiesti main bade badlaav hone hai lekin ab council main vipaksh kaa dabadabaa hoga khaastaur par bade vipaksh shasit rajyon kaa
 Therefore consent is difficult
 jiesti se nuksaan kaa harjaana milane main deree se pareshaan rajya jiesti kaa anushaasan todane kii taraf bad sakate hai
 The changing balance of relations between the center states will prevent the path of major reforms in labor, manufacturing, agriculture, etc
, which are most needed at this time
 mandi se nibatane ke liye modi ko rajyon kii bharpoor madad chahie
 Policy coordination with states is going to be the biggest test of government skills between competitive politics

 You must have heard often, someone stole someone's password, and cheated
 
 
 duniyabar main havers kisi ke bhi sirf password kii chori kar use ratorat sadak par laane ke liye taiyaar baithe rahete hai
 
 
 So, to prevent a similar fraud, the software firm splashdata, which works in the field of password protection and data security, has released the list of 25 worst passwords of the year 2013, and this list for the first time this year
 The password is not at the top
 
 
 varsh 2013 main duniya kaa sabase ghatiya password rahaa, '123456', jo pichley do saal se lagaataar duusare number par tha
 
 
 Over the past year, several high-profile security breeches have been reported, including the case of Adobe leaking user account details
 
 
 aisi vaardaat se saaf he ki badi sankhya main internet yuzar yaad rakhane main aasaan, lekin kaaphi asurakshit password chun lete hai
 
 
 This list of 'splashdata' has been prepared after scrutinizing the millions of passwords which were leaked during 2013 and posted online
 
 
 25 sabase ghatiya password kii suchi main kai password sirf chaar akshar (yaa kairactor) ke hai, yaa unamem sirf ank athwa akshar istemaal kiye gaye hai
 
 
 Some have made passwords only the names of the websites they use
 
 
 angrezi keyboard kii aksharon kii pehali pankti or keyboard kii pahchaan bataane vaale aksharasmooh 'querty' (qwerty) ko suchi main chauthaa sthaan mila he, jabaki 'ilvau' (iloveyou) nauven number par he
 
 
 According to 'splashdata', the release of this annual list of the worst passwords is a step towards making people aware of password protection
 
 
 password management software bechney vaali form 'splacedeta' ke anusaar, kisi achche password manager kaa istemaal phydemand ho saktaa he, jo websiton par swatah hi login kar sake, taaki yuzar majboot se majboot password bana saken, or unhen yaad bhi rakhane kii zarurat na pade
 
 
 Other important tips given by 'splashdata' include avoiding the use of numbers or letter choices (eg 'p4s $ w0rd') and using the same username and password for more than one website or services
 
 
 
 company ke mutabik, aksharon tathaa ankon ko sangyojan se bane lambe password kaa istemaal adhik surakshit hota he, or yadi sambhav ho to lambe vaakya bhi istemaal kiye ja sakate hai, jinamein kai shabd hon, or bich main khaali sthaan bhi ho
 
 
 By the way, the worst 25 passwords of 2013 are as follows

 About 15 years ago, the love of both of them became such that it became a topic of discussion in the area
 lekin usee ishk kaa ek din aisa khaufnak ant hoga yah kisi ne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha

 isi rupee kii shaan main lagaataar batta lagata ja rahaa he
 Its price has fallen to an all-time low against the US dollar
 aise main kuch sectoron main logon ke maathe par shikan he, jabaki dollar paane waalon kii baanchhein khili hui hai
 Many companies whose face is falling due to falling prices, it is adversely affected
 khaskar kaccha maal aayaat karne vaali companiyaan ghate main rahengi
 The account is very simple
 rupaya kamjor hone se kaccha maal aayaat karne vaali companiyon kii laagat or bad jaaegi, jisase unka munafa ghat jayega
 Oil companies top the list of such companies
 tel companiyon ko kachche tel kii kharid dollar main kerani padati he
 This is the reason why the rising dollar will reduce the profits of oil companies
 aankadon ke mutabik, dollar ke mukaable rupaya yadi 1 rupee tak kamjor hota he, to tel companiyon ko kareeb 9,000 karod rupee kaa ghaataa jhelana padataa he
 The effect of the rupee depreciation against the dollar is that many automobile companies, including Toyota and General Motors, are considering increasing the price of cars
 rupee main giravat kaa vaahan companiyon par kharaab asar padataa he
 Such companies also import about 50 percent of the components
 jinke chehre par tairegi muskanrupaya kamjor hone se kuch sectoron main khushi kii lahar paidaa hona lajimi he
 Goods exporting companies are sure to benefit from this
 anya sectoron main bhi jinaki aamadani dollar main hoti he, unhen phayda hoga
 IT, pharma, hotel etc
 are some such sectors, whose profits will increase by climbing above dollar
 yahaan khaas baat yah he ki rupee kii kamajori se oengisi or reliance industries ko phayda hone kii ummid he, kyonki ye companiyaan apane graahakon ko natural gas dollar main bechati hai
 Significantly, the price of one dollar has been around 60 rupees
 rupee kaa yah ab tak kaa nunatam str he

 patnanithish sarkaar ke bihar main pichley do maheenon main ghatit ghatnaon ke liye vipaksh ko jimmevaar tehraae jane ko bijepi ne niraadhaar bataate hue daawa kiya ki vartmaan sarkaar ke nyaay ke saath vikaas or sushasan ke daawey kii hawa nikal gayi he
 Senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi termed the Nitish government's failure to hold the opposition responsible for the recent incidents in Bihar and claimed that the current government's claims of development and good governance blew with justice
 is
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki pehle bihar main kaam karne vaali or samvedansheel sarkaar (jediu kii sarkaar) thi ab keval baat karne vaali samvedanheen sarkaar he
 He accused the Nitish government that the entire Bihar is burning and incidents are happening everyday
 modi ne haal ke dinon main betia or navada main bhadke dange or pichley pakhwaade main guraru main maovadiyon dwaara rail patari ko visphot kar udaane, mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatnaon main ijapha hone sahit anya ghatnaon kaa zikr karte hue bihar main vidhi vyavastha kii sthiti main kaaphi giravat aane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki pichley do maheenon ke dauraan sarkaar kaa ikbaal khatm ho gaya
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that when the government is weak, it blames the opposition for everything so whether it is a Bodh Gaya serial bomb blast, Saran district toxic mid-day mill death case, Chapakal water contamination case Or should there be incidents of rioting in Bagaha, Bettiah and Nawada, the present government of Bihar is responsible for diverting public attention from all these incidents
 She is crying unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se vipaksh par aarope lagane kii yah kala apane puraane sahyogi or argedy supremeo lalu prasad se seekhney kaa aarope lagaate hue unhen chunauti di ki in ghatnaon ke peeche vipaksh kaa haath hone ko ve yah sabit karke dikhaaen
 Modi said that no minister of Bihar reached the airport after the bodies of the martyred soldiers came to Patna
 us samay dilli main maujuud mukhyamantri in shaheedon ko vahiin shraddha-suman arpit kar sakate the par na to vah swayan gaye or na hi apane kisi mantri ko bheja
 Modi said that sending the ministers was the responsibility of the Chief Minister and hence ministers cannot be blamed for this
 unhone kaha ki baad main itnaa vilamb se mantriyon ko jane kaa nirdesh diya gaya ki ek jagah ko chhodkar baaki teen sthanon par mantri shaheedon kii antyeshti main shaamil nahin ho sake
 On the statement given by the JDU to the Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh, who was included in the Nitish government, on the statement given to the martyrs, Modi said that giving notice to such a senior minister is an insult to him
 unhone kaha ki agar ve unki jagah hote to mantri pad se istipha de die hote
 Modi said that if anyone should be given notice in all the developments, then the Chief Minister should be given notice
 susheel kumaar modi ne bihar ke bhayankar sookhaa kii chapet main hone kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki aankadon ke anusaar rajya main saamaanya se 27 pratishat kam varsha hui he tathaa 11 jilon main varsha saamaanya se 50 pratishat kam or 24 jilon main saamaanya se 35 pratishat kam varsha hui he jisase dhan kii ropani 65 pratishat se kam hui he
 He said that drought could be declared in the year 2010 when there was 21 percent less rainfall than normal, then why is the state government not declaring Bihar as a drought-prone state even after 27 percent less rainfall than normal this year
 modi ne kaha ki bijepi kaa ek pratinidhimandal rajyapal se milegaa or unase aagrah karegaa ki ve iske liye sarkaar par dabaav banaaen
 Asked about the Supreme Court's dismissal of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's plea over the fodder scam, Modi said it would increase people's confidence in the judiciary
 modi ne saath hi congress nit centre kii upie sarkaar par argedy or jediu ke netaaon ko bachaane ke liye sibiai kaa durupyog kiye jane kii ashanka bhi jataayi

 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar believes that the time has come for the team management to stop aggressive and experimental talk and focus on playing good cricket

 In the second innings of India, Lankan spinner Rangana Herath took seven wickets, which put India on 112 runs
 baton kii jagah khilne par ho dhyangavaskar ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki hamen aakraamakata, prayogtmak or jo bhi baaki cheez hai unke bare main baat band kar deni chahie
 i think we should concentrate on the game and start playing the game
 ham kaisaa cricket khelenge iske bare main hamen kisi ko spashtikaran dene kii jarurat nahin he
 You have to play cricket that suits your team, which suits the situation in which your team is, is compatible with the pitch you are playing and suits you by watching the opponent against whom you are playing

 Even after a big lead, you can tell that after scoring Sri Lanka for 183 runs in the first innings, India scored 375 runs in their first innings and got a lead of 192 runs

 This defeat was the most disappointing
 Gavaskar said, 'it is one of the most disappointing defeats in India
 kyonki is tarah kii badi badhat milane ke baad aapako jeetne kii ummid hoti he
 But despite taking such a big lead, India could not perform as expected in both the second innings
 jab ve srilanka ko gendbaaji kar rahe the tab bhi or jab ve chauthi pari main ballebaaji karne utre tab bhi
 i had said that if India had a target around 170, it would be a tough challenge
