 Election campaigns are over
 7 april se shuru hue nau charnon vaale is lambey chunaav kaa prachaar bhi ghanghor tha
 If the election period was long, then obviously the campaign was also long and fierce
 hairaani kii baat yah rahi ki itane saare mudde rahete hue bhi chunaav prachaar shorgul or hangaame kii bali hi chadhataa rahaa
 The talk of work has reduced so much that it is surprising whether our leaders have a shortage of issues
 desh par lagbhag chah dashak tak shashan karne vaali party congress apana lekha-jokha bataane kii bajaay anaavashyak aalochana main lagi rahi to bijepi ne bhi yahi rukh akhriyaar kiya
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which was born recently, left no stone unturned
 kshetreey dalon jaise sapa, rajd, trinmul, basapa vagairah ne bhi kam shor nahin machaaya
 Everyone used such words, gave such similes to the leaders of the opposing party that they bowed down in shame
 laga nahin ki ham ek padhe-likhe desh ke naagarik hai or yahaan loktantr chah dashakon se bhi zyada samay se jaden jamaaye baitha he
 But during the campaigning of this election, every effort was made to shake his tenon
 bharat ke itihaas main kisi chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan itnaa shorgul kabhi nahin hua or sabhi dalon ne jamkar shor machaaya
 Nobody took time to tear apart the Election Commission rules
 rakshas, hatyara, khooni, khun kaa pyaasa, luteraa, gadhaa jaisi sharmnaak upamaayen dene se netaa baj nahin aae
 It is a matter of grief and sorrow and questions the future of our democracy
 hamaare netaaon or raajnneetik dalon ne jitna vish vaman kiya utana to samudr manthan se bhi nahin niklaa hoga
 The whole world would have listened to his sporadic words and would have made up his opinion
 khayr, chunaav prachaar kaa ant ho chukaa he
 All the leaders have gone to their respective nests
 ab unki aawaaj kuch dinon tak sunne ko nahin milegi
 a peace will spread in the country which is absolutely necessary
 lekin kya koi netaa yaa dal aatm manthan karegaa ki usne kya or kahaan galat baaten kahi? chunaav prachaar main badha chadhaakar baaten karnaa koi nai baat nahin he lekin is tarah se girakar baaten karnaa vaaki sharminda karata he
 However, it should be hoped that the voices emanating from this terrible noise would not have affected the voters
 ve swatantra hokar aarope-pratyaropon se dur ek behatar bhavishya ke liye sahi ummidavaaron ko vot dene kaa faisla kar chuke honge
 This is the victory of democracy
 lekin yah sawaal bana rahegaa ki netaaon ko shishtachar koun sikhayega? The Delhi Police achieved a major success in the espionage case on Thursday
 police ne paryaavaran mantralay ke joint secretary ke pies ko giraftaar kiya he
 Along with this, the PA of member of Union Public Service Commission has also been arrested by Delhi Police
 badi machhliyon kii is giraftaar se kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 It has become clear that apart from petroleum and other ministries, documents of the Ministry of Environment were also leaked
 aise chalata tha corporate jasusi kaa dhandhapulice kii giraft main aae aaropee jitendra nagpal paryaavaran mantralay ke joint secretary kaa pies he
 The arrested Lokesh had told the police that he used to take documents only through Jitendra Nagpal
 ise churaane kaa kaam jitendra nagpal karata tha
 Jitendra used to work in the environment ministry and Lokesh used to take these documents from him and sell them to other companies
 jasusi cond main duusari giraftaar vipin naam ke shaks kii hui he
 Vipin is a PA of a member of the Union Public Service Commission
 vipin pehle petroleum mantralay main kaam karata tha
 He used to get the documents leaked through one of his colleagues in the petroleum ministry
 sawaal phir khadaa hota he ki kya jin vibhaagon se ye log pakade gaye hai, kya baat yaheen tak simit he
 It is surprising that how important and secret documents are reaching them
 jinaki pahunch main ye hote hi nahin he
 Is it not the responsibility of the senior officials of the Ministry from which they have gone missing from the office
 police ke adhikari is sawaalon par kuch nahin bol rahe hai
 All the arrests in this whole case are of a level that had nothing to do with the document
 phir bhi wo unhen mil jate hai or gaayab ho jate hai
 Actually, the police has now arrested 16 people in this case
 police ne jab lokesh ko giraftaar kiya tha
 It was learned from him that through his associates in the Ministry of Petroleum and Coal, he obtained documents and sold them to another firm other than his consultant firm
 ab police is maamle main aane vaale samay main kuch or logon se poochtacha kar sakati he

 ab ham yah nahin jaanate ki iskaa bada hissaa unheen logon kaa he jinhen ham rasukhdaar log kehete hai yaa aam logon kaa bhi he
 Why are people in relief given relief? By taking advantage of this scheme, their black money will become white
 kaala dhan vaale to saste main chhot jaaenge yaa phir vitt mantri ne is baar videshi kaala dhan laane ke kanoon se vyaapt bhay ko dur kiya he?tippaniyan In 1997, Chidambaram came up with a scheme that we know as VDS
 tab 33000 karod kaala dhan ghoshit hua tha or sarkaar ko kareeb nau se das hajaar karod kaa kar mila tha
 But did black money stop after that? Can we expect that in the next four months, many times its black money will come out and the treasure of the Finance Minister will be huge
 haalanki unhone jor dekar kaha he ki unki yojana kii tulana 1997 kii yojana se na kii jaae
 There is no similarity between the two
 lekin videshon main rakhe kaala dhan or desh ke bheetar maujuud kaala dhan kii ugaahi ke liye ek kanoon kyon nahin ho sakate? kise bachaaya ja rahaa he or kiskaa phayda ho rahaa he? kaala dhan laayaa ja rahaa he yaa logon ko safed karne kaa mauka diya ja rahaa he! In May 2015, the Finance Minister was successful in passing the Black Money Act, under which black money was to be kept abroad from July to September
 tay samay seemaa ke bheetar bataane par 90 fisadi tex or jurmaana bharna tha or uske baad pakade jane par 120 fisadi tex or jurmaane ke saath das saal kii jail kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 But after September, the Income Tax authorities apprehended how many were caught and how much they were caught under this law
 ye jarur pataa he ki july se sitambar ke bich 600 se adhik logon ne 3770 karod rupee kii ghoshnaa kii he
 During this period, those who were exposed were also exempted from the provisions of the Benami Act
 lekin gharelu kaala dhan ko lekar vitt mantri kya naram hue hai? june se sitambar ke dauraan log apana kaala dhan bataaenge or maatr 45 pratishat kaa kar dekar safed bana lenge jabaki videshon main rakhe kaala dhan bataane par saath fisadi tex or jurmaana dena tha
 Why so much favor on indigenous black moneylenders
 kya itani meharbaani niyamit tex bharne waalon se hone vaali chook ke baad kii jaati he? kaala dhan kanoon kii tarah sitambar ke baad gharelu kaala dhan na ghoshit karne waalon ke saath kya sakhti kii jaaegi yah spasht nahin ho sakaa

It is definitely known that between July and September more than 600 people have declared Rs 3770 crore
 is dauraan kulasa karne waalon ko benami act ke praavdhaanon se bhi chhot di gai
 But has the finance minister relented about domestic black money? During June to September, people will disclose their black money and will make white by paying only 45 percent tax, while sixty percent tax and penalty were to be paid for stating black money abroad
 desi kaala dhanakhoron par itani meharbaani kyon
 Is this so much obligatory after a lapse from regular tax payers? It was not clear as to what will be done with those who do not declare domestic black money after September like the black money law

 There is a big reason for this
 The two leaders may be staunch opponents of each other at the moment, but the supporters of both of them probably try to know if the two can become political friends and as it is said in politics that there is no permanent here There is a friend and not an enemy
 lekin ham aapako bataate hai ki aakhir in raajnneetik atakalon kii jad main kya he, jo in donon ke bich har photo kaa vishleshan shuru ho jaataa he
 Everyone believes that neither Nitish is going to take the initiative to form an alliance with the BJP at the moment, nor is there any need for the BJP at the moment, but gradually the political bitterness is diminishing now
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pehle gaiyr-bijepi dal ke netaa the, lekin jab notebandi kii ghoshnaa hui tab 9 navambar kii subah nitish ne piem modi ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya or aaj tak vah iske samarthan main hai haalanki unhone guru parv jo 14 janvari ko khatm hoga uske baad apane nirnay ke bare main party kii baithak bulaane kii ghoshnaa kii he haalanki nitish ne yah kaha tha ki notebandi bina taiyaari ke shuru kii gai he

 Bihar BJP leaders believe that there is no scope for any argument to take criticism or credit from Nitish Kumar for patting him on the back of organizing Guru Parv, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but if BJP leaders believe that victory in Lok Sabha elections After this, PM Modi hoped that Nitish would be able to beat the dust even in the assembly elections, but when Nitish won, then after that maybe both The leaders have come to realize that there is no harm in joining hands after winning each and every bet, although Janata Dal United leaders believe that Nitish has differences with PM Modi regarding his political stream, which still persists , But people should refrain from making political speculation about political etiquette

 do din se channelon par khabar chal rahi he ki AAP vidhayakon ne vetan bhatta badhaane kii maang kii he
 Discussion on this news is also going on, but the discussion on the political angle is limited and the tape is stuck here only on what it has to say on this issue or what it has to say on this issue
 koi is mudde ko gaharaai se samajhakar jamini haqiqat ke hisaab se tatolna nahin chahta
 An anchor of a TV channel asked, 'does your house not run for Rs 83,000? Yes, at least one representative does not work '
 yahaan kisi ke virodh yaa samarthan kii baat nahin, lekin vah patrkaar hi kya hua, jise saalon se jamini str par dilli ko cover karne ke baad is mudde kii samaj naa ho or us samaj ko vah samajha naa paae? Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said that an MLA gets around 54,000 rupees as salary and allowance and the cost of any MLA is more than that of salary and allowance
 saurabh ne samajhane kii koshish kii ki dilli main kaise kharchaa zyada he or vetan bhatta kam
 According to Saurabh, if you open an office here, then it is 10 to 15 thousand
 agar har ward main offis ho to uske kharch kaa aap hisaab laga len
 Now BJP leader Vijendra Gupta announced that he is ready to work on one rupee a month
 lekin jab maine unase poocha ki aap jo ye daawa kar rahe hai, vah vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Are you just not leaving Shigufa? He did not have any argument on this, which would indicate that yes it is practical
 mujhe lagata he is bare main aapaki bhi vahi raay hogi jo meri thi or he
 Actually we citizens should discuss and decide whether the demand of mlas is right or not
 kam se kam apana mat to bataanaa hi chahie, kyonki paisa to ham logon kaa hi he naa
 
 
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 koi is mudde ko gaharaai se samajhakar jamini haqiqat ke hisaab se tatolna nahin chahta
 An anchor of a TV channel asked, 'does your house not run for Rs 83,000? Yes, at least one representative does not work '
 yahaan kisi ke virodh yaa samarthan kii baat nahin, lekin vah patrkaar hi kya hua, jise saalon se jamini str par dilli ko cover karne ke baad is mudde kii samaj naa ho or us samaj ko vah samajha naa paae? Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said that an MLA gets around 54,000 rupees as salary and allowance and the cost of any MLA is more than that of salary and allowance
 saurabh ne samajhane kii koshish kii ki dilli main kaise kharchaa zyada he or vetan bhatta kam
 According to Saurabh, if you open an office here, then it is 10 to 15 thousand
 agar har ward main offis ho to uske kharch kaa aap hisaab laga len
 Now BJP leader Vijendra Gupta announced that he is ready to work on one rupee a month
 lekin jab maine unase poocha ki aap jo ye daawa kar rahe hai, vah vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Are you just not leaving Shigufa? He did not have any argument on this, which would indicate that yes it is practical
 mujhe lagata he is bare main aapaki bhi vahi raay hogi jo meri thi or he
 Actually we citizens should discuss and decide whether the demand of mlas is right or not
 kam se kam apana mat to bataanaa hi chahie, kyonki paisa to ham logon kaa hi he naa
 
 
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public

 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki ek vidhayak ko vetan or bhatte ke taur par kareeb 54,000 rupee milte he or kisi bhi vidhayak kaa kharchaa usase zyada hi he, jitna vetan or bhatta mil rahaa he
 Saurabh tried to explain how the expenditure in Delhi is high and the salary allowance is low
 saurabh ke mutabik yahaan ek offis bhi kholen to 10 se 15 hazaar uskaa kiraaya hota he
 If there is an office in every ward, then you should calculate its expenses
 ab is par bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne elaan kar diya ki vah ek rupee maheene par kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 But when i asked him that what you are claiming is not practical
 kya aap bas shigupha to nahin chhod rahe? is par unke paas koi tark aisa nahin tha, jisase lage ki haa yah vyaavhaarik he
 i think you will have the same opinion about this as i was and is
 asal main ham nagarikon ko charchaa karke yah tay karnaa chahie ki vidhayakon kii maang sahi he yaa nahin
 At least you should tell your opinion, because we only have money
 
 
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 Saurabh tried to explain how the expenditure in Delhi is high and the salary allowance is low

 Now BJP leader Vijendra Gupta announced that he is ready to work on one rupee a month
 lekin jab maine unase poocha ki aap jo ye daawa kar rahe hai, vah vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Are you just not leaving Shigufa? He did not have any argument on this, which would indicate that yes it is practical
 mujhe lagata he is bare main aapaki bhi vahi raay hogi jo meri thi or he
 Actually we citizens should discuss and decide whether the demand of mlas is right or not
 kam se kam apana mat to bataanaa hi chahie, kyonki paisa to ham logon kaa hi he naa
 
 
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 asal main ham nagarikon ko charchaa karke yah tay karnaa chahie ki vidhayakon kii maang sahi he yaa nahin
 At least you should tell your opinion, because we only have money
 
 
 yah baat sach he ki vidhayakon ke paas jane par aapaki samasya kaa samaadhaan ho yaa naa ho, jahaan tak maine dekha he chaay to har vidhayak ke daftar main jane par aapako mil hi jaati he
 Think a tea contains milk, tea leaves, sugar and gas costs, and if sourced from outside, a tea will cost Rs 7-8
 agar 30-35 chaay rozaana pilaane kaa vidhayak daftar kaa ausat maane, to bhi maheene main 1000 chaay kaa kharchaa saat se aath hazaar ho jaataa he
 While sitting in the mla's office, we do not think while drinking that this is also an expense
 kya ham tay karen ki aaj ke baad kisi vidhayak ke daftar main ham chaay kii ummid nahin karenge or agar usne khud bhi chaay pilaane kii peshkash to ham inkaar denge? The MLA has to do office rent, office staff which you always get in the office, electricity and water expenses in opening an office
 agar ham kam se kam bhi maanakar chalem to ek ladkaa offis main hameshaa tainaat rakhane main kam se kam se 10,000 to dene honge hi or offis kaa kiraaya, bijli pani kaa bill bhi kam se kam 10,000 har haal main hoga hi
 So only one office cost was at least 20 thousand rupees a month
 agar har ward main ek offis kholana pad jaae to chaar ward ke hisaab se 80,000 rupee to ye ho gaye
 Should we tell our MLA that one office is enough in our assembly constituency, we do not want another office
 hamako zarurat hogi to bhale hi thodaa dur pade ham aapke offis aaenge, aap chaar daftar naa kholen? or faaltu kaa kharchaa naa karen, kyonki inkaa kharchaa hamane hi dena he
 It is also true of Saurabh Bhardwaj that 4-5 weddings are also attended daily in a season, then we attended 200 marriages throughout the season and we also gave at least 500 rupees in a wedding in Kanyadaan and this is one lakh rupees
 Have become
 kisi bhi vidhayak ko log apane yahaan shaadi main bulaanaa chaahate hai or vidhayak bhi har shaadi main zarur jaataa he, kyonki vah uske voter kii shaadi he uske padosi kii shaadi he
 Now no man goes to the wedding empty-handed and many people keep an eye on what the leaders gave and how much they gave at the wedding
 to kam se kam 500 rupee aap har shaadi main ausat kanyadan bhi denge to lakh rupee kharchaa yahi hoga
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 It is true that your problem may or may not be solved by going to the mlas, as far as i have seen, tea is available to every mla's office
 sochie ek chaay main doodh, chaay kii pattee, chini or gas kaa kharchaa shaamil he or agar baahar se bhi mangaaye to ek chaay 7-8 rupee kii to pad hi jaaegi
 Even if the MLA considers the average of the office of 30–30 teas a day, the cost of 1000 teas is seven to eight thousand a month
 vidhayak ke daftar main baithkar ham pite vaqt nahin sochate ki ye bhi kharch hi he
 Should we decide that after today, we will not expect tea in any mla's office and if he himself offers to drink tea then we will refuse? vidhayak ko ek offis kholane main offis kaa kiraaya, offis staff jo aapako hameshaa offis main mili, bijli-pani kaa kharchaa ye sab vahaan karnaa hota he
 If we go at least as well, then a boy will always have to pay at least 10,000 to keep him posted in the office and the office rent, electricity water bill will also be at least 10,000
 to keval ek offis kaa kharchaa kam se kam 20 hazaar rupee maheenaa hua
 If an office was to be opened in every ward, then it was Rs 80,000 according to four wards
 kya ham apane vidhayak ko kahen ki bhai hamaare vidhansabha kshetra main ek hi offis kaaphi he, hamako doosraa offis nahin chahie
 If we need, even if we are a little far away, we will come to your office, don't you open four offices? And do not spend extravagantly, because we only have to pay for them
 saurabh bharadwaj kii yah baat bhi haqiqat he ki ek sijan main rozaana 4-5 shaadi bhi atend kii to 200 shaadi puure sijan main hamane atend kar lee or kam se kam 500 rupee bhi hamane kanyadan main ek shaadi main die to ek lakh rupee to yahi ho gaye
 People want to invite any MLA to their wedding and the MLA also attends every wedding, because it is the wedding of his voter, his neighbor's wedding
 ab khaali haath to koi bhi aadmi shaadi main nahin jaataa or netaaon ne shaadi main kya diya or kitna diya is par bahut se logon kii nazar rahati he
 If you give at least 500 rupees for every wedding, you will also spend Rs
 kya ham tay karen ki ham apane vidhayak ko bulaayenge to zarur, lekin uskaa diya kuch nahin lenge yaa card dete vaqt hi kah denge ki aapse ummid he ki aap hamaare yahaan apane parivaar or aashirwad ke saath aaen or achche-achche sambandhon kaa uphaar hamase le jaaen
 Apart from this, neither you will give anything nor we will take it
 kya ham aisa kar sakate hai? Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased

 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 Should we decide that we will call our MLA, but we will not take anything from him or say that while giving the card, you are expected to come here with your family and blessings and take the gift of good relations with us
 Go
 iske alaava na aap kuch dijiega or naa ham lenge
 Can we do that? asal main aaj ye sochane kaa vakt he ki ham apane vidhayak se kya chaahate hai or kis tarah chaahate hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that the financial condition of every MLA is not the same
 kuch vidhayak to aise hai jinke paas pehle se apana vyapaar hota he or aise vidhayak vetan badhaane kii maang main zyaada dilchaspee nahin lete
 However, there are some mlas from Delhi who do not have any other source of income and are working only with salary allowance as an MLA
 yah log hi maang kar rahe hai ki itane vetan bhatte main kaam nahin chal rahaa or isko badhaayaa jaae
 To put it a little more openly, according to me, Naresh Balian, an AAP MLA from Uttam Nagar, is financially prosperous, so i do not think his salary allowance should be increased
 lekin rohtash nagar kii vidhayak sarita singh aarthik rup se sampann nahin hai, kyonki vah anna andolan se sidhaa raajnneeti main aa gayi
 mlas like Sarita are finding it difficult to work in this salary allowance
 ab kyonki vidhayakon kii aarthik sthiti yaa sampannataa ek jaisi nahin he or isliye sansaadhan bhi sabake paas ek se nahin hai, to kyon naa ek aise formule par vichaar kiya jaae, jisase aarthik rup se kamazor vidhayak kii madad ho sake or janata ke paise kaa bhi sahi istemaal ho
 However, increasing the salary allowance is not the only option and cannot be, because one truth is that the salary allowance of a legislator or yours and mine is always low and it does not work
 isliye kuch nayaa sochaa jaae, taaki system main kuch to badale
 The comments vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta saal 2007 or 2011 main bhi badha tha or ab 2015 main bhi maang ho rahi he, lekin kuch system to dikhe jisase lage haa itnaa vetan bhatta dena thik he yaa tarksangat he or vaazib he
 Because do not forget that this is the money of the public and the public is watching
 haalanki mere hisaab se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar abhi nai ai he or logon ko isse bahut ummiden hai, isliye agar kuch samay baad is tarah kii maang uthati, thodaa or kaam vidhayak or sarkaar janata ko dikhaate or phir aisi maang karte to acha hota, lekin phir bhi agar maang he to charchaa to zarur honi chahie or phir jo sahi lage vah karnaa chahie
 Actually today is the time to think about what we want and how we want from our MLA
 yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki har vidhayak kii aarthik haalat ek si nahin hoti
 There are some mlas who already have their own business and such mlas are not much interested in the demand for salary increase
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 These people are demanding that work is not going on in this salary allowance and it should be increased
 thodaa or is baat ko khulkar kahuun to ki mere hisaab se uttam nagar se AAP ke vidhayak naresh baalion aarthik rup se sampann hai, isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki inkaa vetan bhatta badhanaa chahie
 But Rohitash Nagar MLA Sarita Singh is not financially prosperous, as she got directly into politics from Anna movement
 sarita jaise vidhayakon kaa hi is vetan bhatte main kaam chalanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now, because the economic status or prosperity of the mlas is not the same and therefore not everyone has the same resources, why not consider a formula that can help the economically weaker MLA and also the money of the public
 Be used properly haalanki vetan bhatta badha dena koi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he or naa ho saktaa he, kyonki ek sach yah bhi he ki vetan bhatta to kisi vidhayak kaa ho yaa aapkaa or meraa vah hameshaa hi kam lagata he or utane main kaam nahin chalata he
 So think of something new, so that something changes in the system
 tippaniyan The salary allowance of the mlas was also increased in the years 2007 and 2011 and now there is a demand in 2015, but some systems may appear that yes it is okay or reasonable to give such salary allowance and it is reasonable
 kyonki ye naa bhoolen ki ye janata kaa paisa he or janata sab dekh rahi he
 However, according to me, the Aam Aadmi Party government has just arrived and people have high expectations from it, so if after some time such a demand would arise, it would have been good if the MLA and the government would have shown a little more work and then made such demand
 But even if there is a demand, then there must be a discussion and then do what is right
 haalanki dilli ke kuch vidhayak aise bhi hai, jinke paas aay kaa koi doosraa strot nahin he or vidhayak ke taur par milane vaale vetan bhatte se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai

P
 chidambaram ne praathmiki ke khilaaf ek sakht bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki sarkaar unke bete ko nishaanaa banane ke liye sibiai or anya jaanch agenciyon kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Chidambaram said that the FIPB approval was given in thousands of cases

 There is no charge against any of them

 In Maharashtra, the dispute between the bjp-shiv Sena is increasing
 rajya main madhyavadhi chunaav kii atakalon par siem devendra fadanvis ne khulkar bayaan diya he
 He said- BJP is ready for mid-term elections in the state
 bataa den ki kisaan andolan ke bich shivasena sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi kii dhamkee de chuki he
 What did Fadnavis say? The Maharashtra CM, who visited Delhi a day ago, said - If someone is threatening to destabilize the government, then we are ready for the mid-term elections
 ham puri koshish karenge ki rajya main bijepi sabase badi party ban kar ubhare
 What did the Shiv Sena say? Recently, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the current Maharashtra government is going to be in trouble after July
 shivasena, bijepi se tab se chidhi hui he jab se 2014 main wo satta main ai he
 Talking to a Marathi news channel recently, Raut said that the Shiv Sena would withdraw support if the farmers' debt was not forgiven

 Will withdraw support
 par ham madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 If someone forces us for a mid-term election then we are ready
 mujhe vishwaas he ki ham phir sarkaar bana lenge
 He said that this success was unprecedented
 kisi bhi anya party ne aisi jeet hasil nahin kii he
 The congress-ncp could not achieve such success even at its peak
 raashtrapati chunaav se pehle is khatpat ke minaagale maheene honerashtrapati chunaav hone vaala he
 On Sunday, BJP President Amit Shah met Shiv Sena Supremo Uddhav Thackeray
 bijepi endie ke sahyogiyon ko is mudde par ekamat karne main lagi he
 In such a situation, many statements can be drawn from this statement of Fadnavis
 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar tikat milane kii aas main kai netaaon ne dal badale, magar kaiyon ke liye yah tarika kaam nahin aayaa
 Normally, the custom of changing parties for their own benefit before any election has been outdated, but in this election there are many leaders who went 'haribhajan ko, ootan lage cotton'
 netaaon ne dal badalakar apane 'nizaam' to badal liye, lekin unhen kahin thor-thikaana nahin mila
 The main contest in this Lok Sabha election in Bihar is between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the grand alliance of opposition parties
 bihar kii sabhi 40 loksabhaa siton main se adhikansh siton par ummidavaar tay kar liye gaye hai, lekin kai dalbadalu netaa abhi bhi apane thor ko lekar pareshaan najar aa rahe hai
 Now the situation is that such leaders either contest the 'without party' (independents) or remain in the new party with their changed resolutions
 bihar vidhansabha ke purv adhyaksh udai narayan choudhary varsh 2015 main vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad apane kathith laabh ko lekar jad (you) ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ke kheme main chale gaye
 Sources say that Chaudhary wanted to contest from Jamui, but Sharad Yadav is contesting from Madhepura on the RJD symbol and Chaudhary could not get a ticket from anywhere
 aisa hi haal purv saansad anand mohan kii patni lavali anand kaa hua he
 Lovely joined the Congress to contest from Shivhar seat, but Shivhar seat went to the account of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the constituent of the grand alliance
 aisi sthiti main lavali bataur nirdaleey chunaav maidan main utarane kaa man bana rahi hai
 Lovely Anand says, "I have been cheated
 kharid-farokht kii vajah se mujhe tikat nahin mila he
 We and our supporters are shocked and disappointed
 samarthakon main niraashaa or aakrosh ko dekhte hue shivahar se nirdaleey chunaav laduungi or jitungi
 The betrayal that has been done to me will have the effect of the Mahagathbandhan having to bear the brunt in many parliamentary constituencies of Bihar as well as Shivhar
 "rashtriya loksamata party (ralospa) ke tikat par pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jahanabad se jite arun kumaar kii bhi haalat kuch aisi hi ho gai he
 Arun first left the RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and formed his own party and became close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 baad main nitish se khatpat hui, tab phir kushvaha ke paksh main bayaan dete hue unke kareeb aane kii koshish kii, lekin ant tak baat nahin bani
 They are currently without tickets and no party has received them yet
 ralospa ke pramukh upendra kushvaha ke najdiki maane jane vaale or party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh naagamani kii bhi haalat kamobesh yahi he
 Nagmani resigned from RLSP and was praising Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the last two-three months
 unhone karakaat sansadeey kshetra se chunaav ladane kii ichha bhi jaahir kii thi, magar baad main ye bhi betikat rah gaye
 Former state Congress president Ramjatan Sinha also joined the JD (U), leaving the 'hands' of the Congress just before the Lok Sabha elections, but he too is disappointed with the ticket
 ralospa ke netaa rahe bhagwaan singh kushwaha ko bhi ummid thi ki unhen jad (you) main jane kaa laabh milegaa or aara kii seat se chunaav ladane kaa mauka milegaa
 This is the reason that in December he changed sides and joined JD (U), but he too did not get the benefit
 iske alaava bhaajapa se nilambit saansad kirti aaazaad congress kaa haath tham chuke hai, lekin ve bhi ab tak 'betikat' hai, unhen ummid thi ki darbhanga kshetra se unhen ummidavaar banaaya jayega, lekin darbhanga seat rajd ke khate main chali gai
 The RJD has nominated Abdul Bari Siddiqui from Darbhanga

 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity which not only kills innocents but also badly affects economic development and social stability
 piem modi ne kaha thaki aatankwaad or jatvaad kaa kisi bhi jariye se samarthan band karne kii jarurat he
 Himachal Pradesh assembly elections have come to a very interesting turn
 matdaan se thik das din pehle bijepi ne mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke rup varisht netaa prem kumaar dhumal ke naam kaa elaan kar sabko chaunkaa diya he
 After the announcement of Dhumal's name, the contest is now between two national parties, with two national parties
 bijepi ne dhumal ko cheharaa banaakar na sirf himachal ke chunavi samikarnon ko badalane kii trick apanaai he, balki party par 75 saal kii umr seemaa tak chunaav ladane ke lage tamge ko bhi dur kiya gaya he
 But the bigger question is whether the fear of defeat has forced the BJP to do so? Actually, this question is because something similar happened in Delhi in 2015
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party jabardast lead kar rahi thi
 With the face of Arvind Kejriwal, AAP was seen to be ahead of the bjp-congress in the election battle
 vahiin bijepi ke paas kejariwal jitna koi majboot phase bhi nahin tha
 Suddenly, the party named Kiran Bedi, the first woman IPS in the country, as CM candidate
 do hafte pehle kiya tha bedi ke naam kaa elaandilli vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 7 farvari 2015 ko matdaan hona tha
 The election campaign was at its peak
 narendra modi or amit shah ne puri takat jhonki hui thi
 Meanwhile, on 20 January, BJP President Amit Shah announced to contest elections under the leadership of Kiran Bedi
 nateeja ye rahaa ki kiran bedi ne krishna nagar seat se chunaav ladaa or wo apni seat bhi nahin jeet pain
 BJP changed the tradition by making Prem Kumar Dhumal, a two-time CM of Himachal Pradesh, CM candidate, BJP has also changed its tradition of not declaring the name of the Chief Ministerial candidate before the election
 2017 main paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hue lekin party ne kisi bhi soobe main chunaav se pehle siem phase kii ghoshnaa nahin kii thi
 In UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa, no face was brought before the elections
 yahaan tak ki sabko chaunkaate hue bijepi ne upi main yogi adityanath, goa main modi cabinet se nikaalkar manohar parrikar or uttarakhand main trivendra singh ravat ko siem banaaya
 Even before the formation of the Modi government at the Center, the BJP also contested the elections in Maharashtra on the face of Modi and won it
 jiske baad devendra fadanvis ko siem banaaya gaya
 After defeating Bhupendra Singh Hooda's strong Congress leadership in Haryana, the BJP handed over the command to the inexperienced Manohar Lal Khattar
 aise main himachal pradesh ke liye ghoshnaa patr jari karne ke baad siem phase ke naam kii ghoshnaa thodaa chaunkaane vaali he
 According to sources, party president Amit Shah suddenly took this decision just before the vote on 9 November
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 31 oktober ko rajgad kii raily se dhumal ke naam kaa elaan karne se pehle amit shah ne mangalvaar ko dhumal ko shimla talab kiya tha
 Dhumal was holding an election rally in his home district of Hamirpur, from where Amit Shah called him and met him
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki isi ke baad dhumal ko siem ummidavaar banane par antim nirnay kiya gaya
 Political analysts believe that Virbhadra Singh holds great stature in Himachal
 congress ne unke naam kaa elaan kar chunavi maahaul ko apni taraf aakarshith karne kaa card khelaa tha, jiskaa asar bhi najar aa rahaa tha
 It is believed that due to this, the BJP also had to announce the leadership of Prem Kumar Dhumal, the most trusted and strong face of the state
 pradhanmantri narendra modi shuukravaar ko ek divasiy afghanistan daure par the, jahaan se unhone achaanak lahore jane or piem navaj sharif se mulaakaat karne kaa elaan kar diya
 While Modi's sudden announcement of going to Pakistan in this way has surprised everyone, on the other hand, the hope of decreasing the distance between the two countries also increased
 kabhi ek hi desh rahe bharat or pakistan ke rishte kabhi ek jaise nahin rahe
 They have always had a fluctuating situation
 may 2014 main centre main bijepi ke aane ke baad bhi donon ke rishte kabhi sudharte najar aae, to kabhi bigadate dikhe
 a look at the changing equations between the two countries: Modi's swearing-in ceremony Nawaz Sharif was also present in May 2014 when Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister, forming the government at the Center
 yahaan pehali baar donon kii pradhanmantriyon ke taur par mulaakaat hui thi
 The next day there was a formal meeting between the two
 modi ke navaj ko shapath grahan main bulaane ko lekar alag-alag halkon se alag-alag raay ai thi
 Indian Foreign Secretaries' visit canceled The Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan decided to meet in August 2014 to pursue mutual negotiations
 bharat ke sachivon kaa pakistan janaa tay hua lekin usase pehle hi pakistan ke hai kamishnar ne dilli main kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon se mulaakaat kii
 India resented this and canceled the visit of its foreign secretaries
 iske baad donon deshon ke bich phir se tanaav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 Modi and Sharif met at the 18th SAARC conference held in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in November 2014, but did not have bilateral talks
 donon ne hi baat ko aage badhaane main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Even in Ufa, in the meeting of Ulfa of Mulaqatarus, the two leaders agreed to restore the dialogue
 agast 2015 main rashtriya suraksha salahakaar (enese) str kii vaarta par aam sahmati bani thi
 Pakistan again slammed Kashmir Ragi before the NSA level talks in August this year, Pakistan once again raised the issue of Kashmir
 pakistan ne kaha ki kashmir kaa mudda uthaae bina donon deshon ke bich baat sambhav hi nahi hai
 Not only this, Pakistan placed a condition that they will meet separatist leaders before the meeting
 iske baad baat itani bigadi ki is baar pakistan ne apane salahakaaron kaa bharat daura radd kar diya
 modi-nawaz met in Paris Earlier, on 30 November, the decision was taken to negotiate terrorism after the agreement reached during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Paris
 isi ke anusaar bangkok main enese str kii vaarta hui
 The External Affairs Minister had said in the Lok Sabha that all problems cannot be solved by a single meeting
 isliye ham aatankwaad par baat jari rakhenge
 Sushma Swaraj also visited Pakistan Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj reached Islamabad in Pakistan this month where she proceeded with the weak bilateral talks
 ye vaarta 2008 main mumbai hamalon ke baad se rukii hui thi
 It was decided here that in January next year, there would be talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries

 It is believed that this is a good attempt to improve the relationship between the two countries

 Swadesh Singh says that if a part of enlightened society can stand against Modi for some reasons
 vahiin kuch logon ko aisa lagata he ki narendra modi ne 5 saal main kai achche kaam kiye hai to unhen aage aana chahie
 Such people should convince the people of the enlightened society by campaigning in support of Narendra Modi
 is abhiyaan main prabud samaaj se judaa har varg jaise
 
 
 Appeals are being made to sections of professors, thinkers, thinkers, columnists, etc
 to speak, write and explain in favor of Modi
 is abhiyaan se jude ek anya professor kaa kahana tha ki agar modi hi agenda ban gaye hai to kyon na unke samarthan main prabud samaaj ke log khadey ho jaaen, kyonki prabud samaaj ke log samaaj ke aage mashaal lekar chalate hai or rasta dikhaate hai
 Modi is the best choice in 2019 so he should come back again
 charchaa karte log'academix for namo' ne yuva chintakon, shodharthiyon or shikshakon ko jodne ke liye ek niabandh pratiyogita bhi shuru kii he

 According to Swadesh Singh, more than 1000 professors from over 200 institutes in 70 cities have joined and given their support
 25 march ke baad ekdemics for namo kii of line meeting bhi yojit kii jaaengi
 The BJP does not want to give up any core efforts to hit the 2019 target
 janvari ke maheene main party ne # modi vans mor # meraa piem meraa abhimaan jaise hashtag ke saath apni majbootee soshal media par dikhaai
 At the same time, # Modi is if possible, # i too, with the watchman hashtag, BJP tried to turn the air of social platform towards itself
 # main bhi chaukeedaar hashtag ko saport karne ke liye khud pradhanmantri or unke sabhi cabinet ke mantriyon ne apane profile par naam se pehle chaukeedaar laga liya
 Your Chowkidar is standing firm & serving the nation
 But, i am not alone
 Everyone who is fighting corruption, dirt, social evils is a Chowkidar
 Everyone working hard for the progress of India is a Chowkidar
 Today, every Indian is saying- # mainbhichowkidar— Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 16, 2019 On the other hand, BJP leaders are also running a hashtag campaign against Congress, this hashtag named # bhagraha Bhaag on Saturday on Twitter Top 10 i have been in trend

 com / oveox3yyhh — Chowkidar Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani) March 23, 2019 amejan prime kii web siries mirzapur relies ke baad se hi charchaa main he
 Its story revolves around 6 main characters
 krime thriller siries main pankaj treepathi, ali fazal, divyendu sharma, vikrant maisi, rajesh tailang or shweta treepathi jaise kalakaar mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai
 The work of many other artists is also very important
 mirzapur abhinay ke lihaaj se shandaar web siries he
 The work of many actors is surprising in this
 ali fazal, divyendu sharma or pankaj treepathi mukhya kirdaaron ke saamne laachaar buudhe ke kirdaar main kulbhushan kharbanda or shubhrajyoti kii acting sikret package kii tarah he
 Let's know how the artist has done in the series
 
 
 Review 2: abhinay ke lihaaj se kisi he pankaj treepathi or ali fazal kii mirzapur? # 1
 Pankaj Tripathiseries features Pankaj Tripathi as "kaalin Bhaiya"
 is kirdaar main wo janche hai, lekin utane prabhavi nahin lagate jitna ki pehle aisi bhoomikaaon main dikhe hai
 It's time for Pankaj Tripathi to think
 wo kuch bhoomikaaon khaskar mafia yaa pita ke kirdaar main tiped hote ja rahe hai
 The writer and director had to do more work on Pankaj's character in Mirzapur
 pankaj kii bhi jimmedaari he ki wo apane puraane kirdaaron se kaise khud ko alag karte hai
 At many places in Mirzapur, he appears in the character of "bareilly Ki Barfi"
 bas muskuraate nahin hai
 So the mafia of "gurgaon" in some scenes
 unhen is khaanche se baahar nikalnaa hoga
 In Mirzapur, Pankaj's character appears to be very high in terms of payment in the last episode where he communicates with police officer Maurya
 # 2
 Ali Fazal's look as Guddu Pandit in the Ali Fazalweb series is in line with the story and character
 guddu, bahut maasoom or sidhaa he, sankochi he, ladakiyon se sharmaataa he or usamen bachapanaa kuta-kootakar bharaa he
 His dreams are like an average child
 haalanki zyaadaatar hisson main vah ek hi mood main najar aata he, is vajah se guddu kaa kirdaar ek rangi ho gaya
 All the other colors of Guddu's personality could not be darker than the norm
 phir bhi ali fazal kaam bahut badhiya he
 In a way, this is the best job in his career
 unhen jaisi kahani or seens mili use puri shiddat se unhone jiya he
 Review 3: Ali Fazal, Pankaj Tripathi's web series Mirzapur, where did you miss? # 3
 vikrant maisibablu pandit ke kirdaar main vikrant maisi bhi janche hai
 His eyes are hesitant, afraid and angry according to the character
 haalanki kahani kii vajah se unka kirdaar zyada bada najar nahin aata
 This is the first time Vikrant has done such a role
 is kirdaar ke baad unki alag tarah se demand hogi
 # 4
 divyendu sharmamunna treepathi ke rup main divyendu sharma sabase zyada hairaan karte hai
 People who have seen his performance in films so far would be surprised to see Mirzapur
 munna had tak krur or vyabhichaari he jo ghar kii naukaraani par havas mitaatha he
 Like he wants to crush every sound rising against him in bed in Mirzapur
 wo itnaa aattaayi he ki juute par peshaab kaa chhinta padane bhar se kisi ko bhi bedardi se marava detaa he
 Even to become King of Mirzapur, he has no qualms in killing his father
 munna ke kirdaar ne divyendu ne sabhi rang dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 It is wonderful to see a compounder strangulate him in a scene in Mirzapur
 mirzapur rivyuu-1: bematlab kii hinsa or kahani main bikharaav ne kiya niraash # 5
 Kulbhushan Kharbanda: If someone's work was the most challenging in Mirzapur, then it is Kulbhushan Kharbanda
 kyonki siries main zyaadaatar unka kirdaar chup hi rahata he
 Their gestures and their eyes communicate
 unke hisse behad kam samvaad aae hai, lekin unhone pairon se laachaar, behad jativaadee paurush par ghamand karne vaale buudhe mafia kaa kirdaar bahut hi shiddat se nibhaayaa he
 The way they take advantage of daughter-in-law Bina's immoral relationship and rape her, the way the servants get Raja punished, they are disgusted by her character
 yahi kulbhushan ke abhinay kii oonchai he
 # 6
 shubhrajyoti bharatarati ke rup main shubhrajyoti kaa kirdaar bhale hi chota he par abhinay, sthaneey samvaad or luk ke maamle main wo siries main sabase parfect dikhte hai
 That is why in every scene, they are quite well-behaved
 unhen dekhakar ek pal bhi nahin lagata ki rati, mirzapur yaa jonpur kaa mafia nahin hai

 film 'tum bin 2' premi jode taran or amar kii kahani he jo landan main rahete hai
 Amar is missing due to an accident and is presumed dead
 tabhi amar ke parivaar kii zindagi main shekhar aa jaataa he or us parivaar or taran kii jindagi main khushiyaan bhar detaa he
 Even Taran and Shekhar begin to fall in love and then after living in a coma for 8 months elsewhere, Amar comes back home and the film becomes a triangular love story
 clymex main taran kise milegi yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 You may have seen this kind of triangular love story many times before, but what makes each film different is its script
 is film kaa screenple bhi alag he
 The film has good emotional scenes in the first half
 pyaar se bichhadne kaa dard he
 The father is sad to lose the young son
 film main taran ke saath room main rahane vaale kirdaar kuch or jaan daalate hai
 There are scenes of laughter joking between these characters that make the audience get out of the serious atmosphere from time to time
 landan or aas paas ke ilaakon ke sundar drishy hai
 The sound of music that sounds good to the ears is heard in between
 neha sharma, aditya sil or aseem gulati ne apane apane kirdaaron ko achche se nibhaayaa he
 The comments 'tum bin-2' kaa ek seen mujhe behad pasand aayaa jisamen dikhaaya gaya he ki ek pakistani hindu parivaar landan main he
 That family understands the difference between religion and culture
 is seen ke dwaara anubhav sinha ne bade hi achche se bahut kuch kah diya he
 But after the interval everything in the film starts going upside down
 film kii raftaar dhimi padane lagati he or isaki lambaai zyada lagane lagati he
 It seems that writer and director Anubhav Sinha has nothing left to show in the second part of the film, so he starts pulling the film
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars
 is tarah kii trikoniya prem kahani aapane pehle kai baar dekhi hogi magar har film ko ek duusare se alag banaati he uski patakatha
 The screenplay of this film is also different
 film ke pehle half main achche imotional seen hai
 It is a pain to fall in love
 jawan bete ko khone kaa pita kaa dukh he
 In the film, the characters living in the room with Taran add some more life
 in kirdaaron ke bich hansi majaak ke drishy hai jo darshakon ko samay samay par syrius maahaul se baahar nikalate hai
 There are beautiful views of London and surrounding areas
 bich bich main kaanon ko achche lagane vaale sangeet kii awaz sunai detii he
 Neha Sharma, Aditya Seal and Aseem Gulati play their respective characters well
 tippaniyan i very much liked a scene of 'tum Bin-2' in which a Pakistani Hindu family is in London
 vah parivaar dharm or samskruti main fark samajhataa he
 Anubhav Sinha has said a lot with this scene
 magar interval ke baad film main sab kuch ulta hone lagata he
 The film starts to slow down and its length starts to increase
 aisa lagane lagata he ki lekhak or nirdeshak anubhav sinha ke paas film ke duusare bhaag main dikhaane ko kuch bachaa hi nahin isliye wo film ko khinchne lage
 So my rating for this film is 2
 5 star

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kii sargarmi ke bich 'padmavati' ko lekar raajnneeti shuru ho gai he
 Two big parties in the form of BJP Congress have demanded a ban on the release of the film before the elections
 congress ne kaha he ki sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati kii relies par tab tak roak lagaae jab tak ki karani sena or rajput samaaj use clear nahin karata
 In Gujarat, senior Congress leader and party spokesperson Shakti Singh Gohil said, 'it is not right to tamper with the history of a society, not just Rajputs
 mujhe pehle karani sena ne khat likhaa tha ki kshatriya gaurav ke sataha film main chhedchhad hui he
 
 maine us karani sena ke khat ke saath khud piem ko khat likhaa tha
 The demand of Karni Sena is valid
 shakti singh ne kaha, tab smriti irani ne kaha tha ki film banegi, us par koi roak nahin
 Now due to the Gujarat elections, the BJP is demanding the Election Commission to ban only till the elections
 aakhir usko ab kshatriya voton kaa dar sata rahaa he
 Indira ji started campaigning from Amba Devi temple, Rahul ji from Dwarka, then Modi ji came back
 chotila mandir rahul gaye to piem bhi aae
 Gohil said, development has gone mad, the public said
 ye janata kii awaz he, bijepi to apni profeshnal team ke jariye kharch karke apana prachaar karte hai
 Shahid, who was INSECURE with Ranveer Singh, said this condition before the director, what did the BJP say? Earlier, BJP has written a letter to the Election Commission, Central Government and Censor Board
 jisamen kaha ki yah film kshatriya samudaay kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaa sakati he
 Hence the film should be shown to the Rajput representatives of the party before its release
 party kii daleel he ki aisa karne se relies ke vakt film ke liye sahuuliyat rahegi or kisi bhi tarah kii tanaavpurn paristhitiyon se bachaa ja sakegaa
 The statement of BJP spokesperson and Rajput leader IK Jadeja to be released after the Gujarat elections has come out
 unhone film ko lekar diarector ko do vikalp dete hue kaha, film ko bain kiya jaae yaa ise gujarat chunaav ke baad relies kiya jaae
 He, however, denied that the Protest had anything to do with the upcoming election
 aaike jadeja ne kaha, party ko rani padmini se jude tathyon se chhedchhad kiye jane kii chintaa he
 The film was reported to film an intimate scene between Rani Padmini and Khilji
 padmavati kaa 3D trailor launch, deepika ne kaha- film ko nahin roak saktaa koibhansali ke saath hui thi hathapayeevaise rani padmini or khilji ke bich intimet seen filmaae jane kii khabaron kii vajah se kerani sena film kaa virodh kar rahi he
 He protested saying that history was being tampered with
 kerani sena ne film ko relies se pehle dikhaae jane kii maang kii thi
 Let me tell you, in January, the activists of Karni Sena sabotaged the shooting of 'padmavati'
 film ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath hathapayee kii ghatana bhi hui thi
 Deepika had said that the film will be released in every condition
 Recently, at the 3D trailer launch of the film, Deepika said that no one can stop it from being released
 film apane tay samay par relies hogi
 The film is releasing on December 1

 Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan did not change the policy interest rate today
 vah dekhnaa chaahate hai ki khaadya mudrasphiti par haal kii bemausam barish kaa kya asar rahata he saath hi vah yah bhi chaahate hai ki repo dar main pichhali katautiyon kaa phayda upabhoktaaon ko den
 Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends cash to commercial banks for their immediate needs
 repo dar is is samay 7
 5 percent
 rigerv bank ne nakad arakshit anupaat (siaraar) main koi badalav nahin kiya or yah chaar pratishat bana rahegaa
 CRR is the portion of deposits that banks have to keep with the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank does not pay them interest
 governor rajan ne 2015-16 kii maudrik niti kii aaj pehali dwaimasik samiksha main kaha, rin kii maang kam hone or pehle hi do baar nitigat daron main katautee kiye jane ke baavjood uskaa karj kii dar par asar abhi nahin dikhaa he
 Governor Rajan said, the impact of the RBI initiative has not gone ahead (meaning banks have not reduced loan rates)
 iske alaava aane vaale aankadon se mudrasphiti ke jokhim santulan kii sthiti or spasht hone kii ummid he
 Therefore, the status quo has been maintained in the Reserve Bank
 bemausam barish or olavrishti ke uttar or pashchim bharat main rabi kii taiyaar fasalon par asar se khaadya mulya main badhotaree kii ashanka bad gai he
 Rajan has previously separated from review meetings in January and March
 25-0
 The market was shocked by a 25 percent cut
 aaj nitigat daren aparivartit rakhte hue unhone udaar nitigat pahalon ke prati reverj bank kii patibaddhta jataai, lekin kaha ki nitigat daren aagaamee aankadon par nirbhar karengi
 He said that cutting the interest rates by banks would be his top priority
 unhone kaha ki khaadya mulya jaise anya tatwon kii nigaraanee hogi or haal main hui bemausam barish ke asar par bhi kadi najar rahegi
 He said that the Reserve Bank would be vigilant against the volatile risks
 saath hi unka yah bhi kahana he ki is samay mudrasphiti kii gati rigerv bank ke anumaanon ke mutabik hi he
 Holi will be celebrated with great fanfare across the country on 21 March
 isse pehle 20 march kii shaam ko holikaa dahan (holika Dahan) kiya jayega
 This festival of Holi (holi 2019) is accompanied by a shower of colors on every side along with the dishes
 lekin kya aapako maaloom he ki bharat ke is sabase prasiddh tyohaar kaa sambandh pakistan se he? mana jaataa he ki holi kii shuruyaat bharat main nahin balki pakistan se hui
 The reason behind this is said to be very special and that is the Prahladpuri Temple present in the city of Multan in Pakistan
 mana jaataa he ki hiranyakashyap ke bete pralhad ne bhagwaan narsingh (vishnu ke avatar) ke sammaan main ek mandir banwaaya, jo philhal pakistan ke shahar multan main aata he
 Lord Narasimha had saved the life of the devotee Pralhad by giving his darshan in the pillar
 isi mandir se holi (holi) kii shuruyaat hui
 Here Holika Dahan festival and Holi were celebrated for nine days for two whole days
 pakistan ke multan main maujuud pralhadpuri mandiris jagah par bharat main manaai jane vaali janamashtami (janmashtami) kii tarah holi vaale din matki phodi jaati he
 The matki is hung at a height
 phir pyramid ke akarmenek ke upar ekchadhakar matki phodi jaati he
 Special thing, this matki also has butter and sugar candy
 pakistan ke multan main is parv ko chowk-purna tyohaar kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, let me tell you that this first temple of Lord Narasimha was damaged
 spiking tree ke mutabik bharat main babari masjid (babri Masjid) ko giraane ke baad pakistan main kai hindu mandiron ko giraaya gaya, jinamein se ek pralhadpuri mandir bhi tha
 But now the idol of Lord Narasimha kept in this temple is in Haridwar, which Baba Narayan Das Batra brought to India
 narayan das prasiddh vayovruddh sant hai, jinhone bharat main kai skulon or collejon kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 He was also awarded the Padma Shri in the year 2018 for the work done for the upliftment of the society
 dilli se maasoom bacchon ke laapata hone kii ghatnaon par adaalatein pehle hi kai baar chintaa jataa chuki he
 Now the government has made full preparations to protect the children and to tighten the gangs involved in their trafficking
 dilli police trephic signal par bheekh maangane vaale bacchon kaa diene test karvaa sakati he
 According to 2 unique initiatives of the Delhi Police on the New Year, the Delhi Police has taken this decision after the PMO received a complaint about it
 ek shaks ne piemo ko i-mail ke jariye shikaayat kii thi ki trephic signal par bheekh maangane vaale kai bachche agava kar laae gaye hote hai
 The DNA test will reveal how much truth lies in the claims of anyone who claims to be the parent of a begging child
 baharhaal, agar dilli police kii yah muhim kaamyaab rahati he, to bacchon kii chori main shaamil kai giroh kanoon kii giraft main aa jaaenge
 This can be considered a major step towards protecting children

 railway jald aayega vikaas ke trek parahaalanki principal secretary mishra ne yah ummid bhi jataayi he ki railway ministar suresh prabhu ummiido par jald hi khare utrenge or railway ko vikaas ko sahi disha main le jaaenge

 The student wrote such an essay in just 19 words, the teacher gave 100 / 100 terrorist organization IS, after reading, claimed responsibility for the attack, but the government blamed the local extremist group National Tauheed Jamaat (NTJ) for the blasts
 ‘colombo gajet' ne esaelarsies ke hawaale se kaha he ki visphot main ghayal hone kii vajah se 75 pariwaron kii aajeevika prabhavit hui he, kyonki visphot main unke parivaar kaa koi na koi sadsy jakhmi hua he

 However, nothing special has been found in this budget for the middle class
 iske ulat bajet ne uski chintaaen badha di hai
 After the budget, there is a possibility of disturbing the budget of the common man's house
 isaki vajah he iskar ke morche par raahat na milanaa or mahangaai badhane kii ashanka
 Let's know how the country's general budget has worked to increase your spending
 iske saath hi jaaniye kahaan-kahaan aapako zyada kharch karnaa pad saktaa he
 In the budget of inflation, the government has decided to increase the minimum support price of agri products by one and a half times to double the income of farmers
 aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki is faisle se desh main mahangaai ko dastak dene se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Increasing the budget support price of the kitchen will deteriorate the prices of crop products in the country, due to which inflation is fixed
 darasal adhik samarthan mulya ke is nitigal faisle se centre sarkaar ke khajaane par boj padegaa or aam aadmi ko genhu, chaaval, daal or tilhan tay nirdhaarit keemton se adhik par uplabdh hoga

 The common man may have to bear the loss of increasing custom duty
 darasal custom duty main badhotaree hone se bharat main aayaat karne vaali companiyon kii laagat bad jaati he
 Companies impose this cost on the common man
 iskaa nuksaan ye hoga ki aapke liye tivi-frij or mobile phone samet anya home aplyansej khareednaa mahangaa ho saktaa he
 No relief on tax front either
 The central government has not given any relief on the tax front in the general budget
 aam aadmi ko ummid thi ki use is bajet main tex ke morche par kam se kam 50 hajaar rupee kii raahat milegi
 But the Government has not changed this and kept them in the old tax slab

 Both father and son are surrounded by a strange confusion
 par papa bete kii jagah zyada baichaiyn hai tabhi rishi kapur karan johar ko kisi bhi keemat par bakhshane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 But the answer to this question is not available as to what is the silence of Ranbir Kapoor regarding this matter
 zyaadaatar rishi khamosh rahete hai or ranbir media main khud se judi har baat kii safai ke liye aage aate hai
 Affair with Deepika and then Breakup or Affair with Katrina
 kisi bhi maamle main rishi kabhi kuch nahin bole or ranbir khamosh nahin rahe
 But this is the opposite where the son is silent and the father is on the front
 ek jaankaar ne kaha ki ghar ke andar hi yah maamla tanaav bharaa hua ho gaya he kyonki rishi ne ranbir kii is puure maamle ko tool nahin dene kii baat nahin maani
 What if the poor person shaved! khanpan kaa paushtik hona jitna jaruri he, utana hi jaruri he sharir ke hisaab se apni diet ko santulit rakhana

 People in this group should eat less meat because it takes time to digest
 agar e blad group ke hai to chikan-matan kaa seven kam karen
 Consuming carrots, green leafy vegetables, pears, garlic, cereals, beans and fruits would be best for this blood group
 doodh or isse bani chijen, safedchaaval or andon kaa sevenkarne main saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 Yogurt or soy milk can be consumed in their place
 bi blad group vaale hote hai lakengar aapkaa blad group bi he to yah aapke liye khushkhabari ho sakati he
 Actually people of this blood group do not have to be overbearing
 aapahari patteydaar subjiyan, fal, fish, matan or chikansb kuch kha sakate hai
 Those with this blood group have a very good digestive system, so that they do not accumulate fat in their body

 Just keep in mind that their food habits are balanced
 abi blad group he to santulit rakhen dietebi blad group bahut kam logon main paaya jaat he
 Things which a and b are told to avoid, they should also be cautious in eating the same things

 Today, the election campaign will come to an end
 Regardless of Dhan Shakti
 
 ultimately Jan Shakti prevails
 Even though i am uninvited, like in other states
 
 
 from Bihar to UP to Gujarat as a star campaigner, for reasons best known to all of us, i shall humbly suggest

 as an old friend, colleague & still a well-wisher, supporter & member of the party
 
 Let's not cross limits
 Let's not get personal
 Issues should be conveyed in most beautiful way, keeping decorum
 Maryada & Garima of honourable PM must be kept intact
 
 @narendramodi@amitshahwhy do we come with odd & ridiculous definitions
 
 
 like PPP for INC (pondicherry, Punjab & Pariwar)
 Results will be announced on 15th
 Anything can happen
 Being PM does not make anyone the wisest in the country
 
 
 
 for being PM requires no qualification
 
 
 only majority

 - input bhashaa With the Aadhaar card, it has now been made mandatory to link your insurance policy
 iske liye aapke paas 31 disambar tak kaa samay he
 But if you are not able to link your insurance policy to Aadhaar by this date, then it will affect you a lot
 31 disambar ke baad aadhaar se beemaa policy kaa link hona ahm hoga or ise isaki kevaisi prakriya kaa ek ahm hissaa bana diya jayega
 There may be many problems till December 31, if you did not link your insurance policy to the Aadhaar card, then you may face many problems
 isamen sabase zyada dikkat un logon ko ho sakati he, jo apni beemaa policy ko clem karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 In the event of Lincoln from the base, he may face difficulty in obtaining the claim
 beemaa company clem settle karne ke liye aapke saamne aadhaar ko beemaa policy se link karne kii shart rakh sakati he
 Short time limit for linking The time limit fixed for linking policies can prove to be quite short
 ab logon ke paas dedh maheene se bhi kam vakt bachaa hua he is kaam ko puraa karne ke liye
 The situation is such that some people are quite confused about linking Aadhaar with different services
 kuch logon ko to pataa hi nahin he ki unhen yah kaam karnaa kaise he
 There is a need to make aware that for this it is necessary that insurance companies make their customers aware in this regard and remind them not only to link the insurance policy to Aadhaar, but also to make them aware
 companiyon kii taraf se jab ye koshish bade str par kii jaaegi, tab hi 31 disambar tak yah kaam puraa ho sakegaa
 IRDAI has issued instructions that the insurance regulatory authority IRDAI has issued instructions that it is necessary to link every insurance policy to Aadhaar
 iske liye 31 disambar aakhri taarikh tay kii gai he
 Remember that many other schemes, including bank account, have to be linked to Aadhaar before December 31
 aisa nahin karne par aapako seva baadhit hone kaa khatra he

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet pesh kar diya he
 There was nothing special in this budget for smartphone users
 arun jetali ne bajet ke dauraan kaha he ki emported mobile par custom duty 15 fisadi se badhaakar 20 fasidi kar di gai he
 This means that mobiles made in India will be more expensive, but the prices of mobile phones imported from other countries will increase
 bajet bhaashan khatm hote hi mobile companiyon ke pratikriyaayein aani shuru ho gai hai
 Finland smartphone maker HMD Global India Vice President Ajay Mehta has said, 'HMD Global will continue to work strongly on PM Modi's Make in India campaign
 mobile phones ke liye emport duty badha kar 15 se 20 fisadi kar di gai he,yah faisla hamaare bijness par kam asar daalega, kyonki abhi nokia phones ke sabhi modells bharat main hi banaae ja rahe hai
 Syed Tajuddin, CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Coolpad India said after this budget, 'this budget is mixed and there is nothing that can be said that it can boost the production sector in India
 agriculture or rural iconmi ke liye yah acchhee khabar he, lekin mobile handset industry ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 The CEO of Coolpad further adds, "increasing the custom duty from 15% to 20% would be a burden on the customer, especially when high end smartphones go to repair"
 He also said that the increase in custom duty Due to this, there will be pressure on more companies to make their handsets in India and assemble, but the local ecosystem does not have better support for spare parts of production
 ’kul mila kar coolpad kaa maananaa he ki iskaa sidhaa asar customers kii jeb par padegaa chaahe wo mobile kharidne main ho yaa use repere karaane main ho
 Rajiv Jain, CFO of Swadeshi mobile phone maker Intex, said, "this budget is better for the indigenous business
 intex ko tear 2 or 3 shaharon ke liye kanjumar products banane ke liye janaa jaataa he or ab is bajet ke baad electronic products kii demand bhi badhegi’rajeev jain ne customer duty badhane par kaha he, ‘mek in india ke liye custom duty ko badhaayaa jane vaala kadam swaagat yogya he
 This will boost plant setup and production here in India
 yah intex jaise swadesh companiyon ke liye shandaar he jo kaaphi pehle se hi yahaan utpaadan karte aae hai’swadeshi smartphone nirmaataa smartron ke found r or chairman mahesh lingareddy ne is bajet kii pratikriya ke taur par kaha he,‘ mobile phone par basic custom duty main badhotaree local utpaadan ke liqucchhi pahal he or isse bharat meninnovations ko bhi madad milegi
 Vikas Aggarwal, general manager of Chinese smartphone maker One Plus India, has said, "85% of smartphones sold in India have been made in India since the Make in India program was announced 3 years ago
 isliye ab samay he ki aise regaullation banaae jaaen jisase utpaadan kshetra main nivesh ke liye companiyon ko aakarshith kiya ja sake
 Currently, all the smartphones of One Plus are made in India, so we are already working to increase the share in local production so that the new regulation will have the least impact on the customers

 unhone kaha ki jab tak satta or vyavastha parivartan nahin hota he, vah chaiyn se nahin baithenge or naa hi sarkaar ko baithne denge

 aise main mandir ke andar nahin jane kaa faisla raashtrapati kaa tha, na ki kisi or vajah se ye faisla liya gaya
