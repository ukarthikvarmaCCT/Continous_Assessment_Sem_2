 ' Amid pressure from India to prosecute more and more people involved in the Mumbai terror attacks, Pakistan on Saturday indicated that it is willing to provide voice samples of the perpetrators of the attacks to India
 pakistan ne bharat ko kisi bhi anya prakaar ke sahyog kii peshkash bhi kii he
 On Friday, a day after the meeting focused on the Mumbai attacks, India's Home Minister p Chidambaram and his Pakistani counterpart Home Minister Rehman Malik spoke in a positive tone and said they were hopeful of the outcome of the talks

 "modi darasal media kii dein hai
 In 2014, the Congress is not pitted against bjp's tallest leader like Atal Bihari Vajpayee but tainted Narendra Modi
 
 
 " apni america yatra se pehle agency royatres ko die intervyuu main narendra modi par vittamantri pi chidambaram kii chingaariyaan darasal aagaaj bhar hai
 Over time, both the sharpness and the density of the political attacks of the Congress on the bjp's prime ministerial candidate will increase
 vajah, oktober kii shuruyaat ke saath hi congress ne tay kar liya or apane tamaam sheersh netaaon ko bhi aadesh de diya tha ki modi kaa ek bhi waar khaali mat jane do
 If you kill two, you kill four
 hamalaa bhi khaas makasad ke saath jo modi ko gujarat kaa kshetreey netaa bataane tak simit rakhe or har daanv ke saath dangon kaa zikr bhi jarur aae
 So Chidambaram's recent attacks are just a sequel to this primetime soap opera
 chidambaram ne apane bayanon ko atal-adwani kii tulana main modi ko nicha dikhaane tak hi simit nahin rakhaa balki sadhe hue lahaze main kaha ki shahari yuvaaon ke baahar modi kaa koi prabhaav nahin lihaaja congress ko 2014 main modi se koi khatra nahin
 Modi's track record is tainted
 halaki chidambaram kii chingaariyaan bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne aadhiraat hi buja deen
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Shahnawaz said that Rahul Gandhi did not leave Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a public press conference, so Chidambaram is now directly attacking Narendra Modi to increase his stature in the Congress
 kshetreey bhashaaon main bahes kii chidambaram kii maang par shahanvaj ne kaha ki congress main yadi dam ho to rahul gandhi ko narendra modi ke khilaaf khadaa kar bahes karaae
 Since Chidambaram is against Hindi, he is demanding a debate in languages other than Hindi
 sansad main to congressi netaaon kii jabaan par taale lage hote hai or baahar ye bahes kii taal thonkate hai
 On the whole, one thing is very clear from the statements of Chidambaram that the state of unease in the party regarding Modi's treatment is now over
 party andruni dwand ke is daur se baahar nikal chuki he ki wo apane bayanon main modi ko torget kare yaa phir samoochee bijepi or uski kaaryastylee ko
 Now the strategy is to attack Modi fiercely
 congress ke khilaaf modi kii kaman se nikle har nahale par dahala maarane kii he

 If the time students of the exam make even a small mistake, then the water can turn back on the hard work
 aksar exam dete hue students prashn patr ko achche se nahin padhanaa jaisi galtiyaan karte hai
 If you too are preparing for the board exam then avoid making these common mistakes
 prashn patr ko achche se nahin padhanaa:students ko prashn patr padhane ke liye 15 minute kaa samay diya jaataa he
 At that time, students start solving questions instead of reading question papers
 jisase wo bina padhe jis section main kam prashn karne hote hai usamen zyada prashn hal kar dete hai or apana time kharaab karte hai
 Therefore, students should read the question paper well
 time management:students ko exam main time management karke chalanaa chahie
 Often students do not run by managing time and their paper is left
 student ko time management is tarah se karnaa chahie ki wo section jo zyada marks ke hon pehle khatm ho jaae or uske baad kam number vaala section hal kerani ke koshish kerani chahie
 Copying wrong data: When solving numerical questions, students often look at the question paper and write the wrong number
 jisaki vajah se sawaal galat ho jaataa he isliye sawaal utaarte samay saavdhaanee baraten or data ek baar phir se check kar len
 Do not write the answer in point: Students should prepare a clean improved examiner friendly answer sheet
 aksar students bade-bade paragraph main ansar likhte hai jisase ejaminner ko check karne main pareshaani hoti he
 As far as possible, students should write their points in points

 Our neighboring country, Pakistan, has always been trying desperately to break India

 The 100 percent support that Haryana has given to the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections this time, the effect is visible today
 haryana kaa ye kshetra ab 4-5 neshnal haive se jud gaya he, nae medical college yahaan ban rahe hai, lostic hub ban rahaa he
 All this is happening when you put a double engine
 dilli main narendra modi kaa ingine or haryana main manohar laal ji kaa ingine
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister said, our villages are giving impetus to the social changes happening in the country
 hamaare gaanv hi apni samskruti or paramparaon ko banaae rakhte hue samaaj ko nai soch or nae raste par le ja rahe hai
 Only the villages of the country proved their resolve to get rid of open defecation
 hamaare gaanv hi jal jivan abhiyaan main har ghar tak jal pahunchane ke mishan main ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 If the villages of Haryana had not come forward, save the daughter - the Beti Padhao movement would not have been so widespread and so effective, it would not have been so productive
 piem ne kaha, haryana kaa har vyakti bolta he 'mhaari chhori ke choro se kam he'
 When such a movement is formed, the world is forced to say that the daughters of India are really a rage
 ye dhak aaj duniya ke manch par dikh rahi he
 The world is experiencing it
 ye diwaali hamaari betiyon ke naam honi chahie
 Those daughters who are giving glory to our family, our society and our country by becoming Lakshmi, must surely worship their achievements

 New system of appointment of judges in High Court and Supreme Court During the hearing of the constitutional validity of NJAC, the Central Government once again questioned the Collegium system in the Supreme Court
 sarkaar ne ek baar phir is maamle kii 11 jajon kii peeth se sunwaayee kii maang kii
 On behalf of the central government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that the collegium had appointed a 59-year-old female lawyer as a judge of the Kolkata High Court as she was a close relative of the then CJI
 baad main hoicourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne ritair hone par bataaya tha ki unke virodh ke kaaran sijeai ne unhen supreme court main pramot nahin hone diya
 Similarly, Justice PD Dinakaran was recommended to be a judge in the Supreme Court, while he was accused of occupying government land
 vahiin jajon ke sthanantaran kis aadhaar par or kyon hote hai, yah bhi nahin pataa lagata
 Appearing before a five-member constitution bench headed by Justice JS Khehar, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that it is judicial independence on what basis the Chief Justice in the High Court recommends names for judgeship, what are the rules for this, anyone do not know
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki colegium pranali ke mul nau jajon ke faisle main sijeai ko sarvocch bana diya jabaki samvidhan ke anuchhed 124 main yah kahin nahin hai
 He said that in this decision only control over appointments was considered independence of the judiciary, whereas the framers of the constitution did not even think so
 vahiin supreme court ke paanch jajon ko nyaaypalika kii aazaadee kaa pratik bana diya gaya
 Why five are the only three judges in this because they decide by majority
 kya yah nyaayik swatantraaa he
 Are the other 27 judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of all the High Courts under these three judges
 tippaniyan The Attorney said that the government appoints constitutional posts like CAG (auditor General), Lok Sabha Secretary General and Chief Election Commissioner, while these institutions are not at all under the government
 inhen bhi jajon kii tarah sansad main mahabhiyog ke jariye hi pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 The Election Commission conducts fair elections across the country while the CAG conducts a rigorous review of the government's actions
 lekin isamen kabhi yah sawaal nahin uthaa ki sarkaar ne unke kaaryon main hastkshep kiya ho
 He said, independence begins after appointment, not before
 sarkaar ne kaha ki behatar hoga samvidhan peeth is masale ko 11 jajon kii peeth ko bheje, kyonki engeesi 9 jajon kii peeth kii vyavastha ko ulatata he
 However, the Supreme Court has also raised many questions on the government and said that first the government should satisfy the court that the new system is better and transparent than the collegium
 sunwaayee guuruuvaar ko bhi jari rahegi

 sunwaayee guuruuvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 Mukul Rohatgi said that the decision of the original nine judges of the collegium system made the CJI supreme, whereas it is nowhere in Article 124 of the Constitution
 unhone kaha ki is faisle main sirf niyuktiyon par niyantran ko hi nyaaypalika kii aazaadee maan liya gaya, jabaki samvidhan ke nirmaataaon ne aisa sochaa bhi nahin tha
 At the same time, five judges of the Supreme Court were made the symbol of independence of the judiciary
 paanch bhi kyon isamen sirf teen jaj hi sarvocch hai kyonki ve bahumat se faisla karte hai
 Is it judicial independence? kya supreme court ke anya 27 jaj tathaa tamaam hoicorton ke mukhya nyaayadhish in teen jajon ke adheen hai
 The comments atarni ne kaha ki sarkaar kaig (mahalekha pareekshak), loksabhaa ke mahasachiv or mukhya nirvachan ayukta jaise sanvaidhanik padon par niyuktiyaan karti he, jabaki ye sansthaaen bilkul sarkaar ke adheen nahin hoti
 Like judges, they can be removed from office only by impeachment in Parliament
 chunaav ayog puure desh main nishpaksh chunaav karwaata he vahiin sieji sarkaar ke kaaryon kii kadi samiksha karata he
 But there was never a question that the government interfered in their actions
 unhone kaha, aazaadee niyukti ke baad shuru hoti he pehle nahin
 The government said that it would be better to send the constitution bench to the bench of 11 judges, as the NJAC reverses the system of the bench of 9 judges
 haalanki supreme court ne bhi sarkaar par kai sawaal uthaae hai or kaha he ki pehle sarkaar court ko santusht kare ki nayaa system colegium se behatar or paardarshee he
 The hearing will continue on Thursday

 The 25-year-old American teacher took a tour package to visit India in the month of April
 mahila teacher kaa aarope he ki uske tour guide ne pani kii bottle main koi nashila padaarth mila diya tha or uske baad hotel ke karmchaariyon ke saath milakar uske saath gangrape kiya
 The woman told NDTV, 'I came on a scheduled tour and i was taken directly to a five-star hotel in Connaught Place
 shuruaati do dinon main mujhe nashila padaarth khilaa diya gaya or tour company ke do karmchaariyon or hotel ke do karmchaariyon ne mere saath balaatkaar kiya
 i recognize the faces of these people
 ' The woman did not register a case when she was in India but after returning to her home country, Pennsylvania, she filed a case through a us-based nonprofit organization
 usne bataaya ki america main rahakar bharat main cese darj karana bahut mushkil tha
 In a statement recorded on Friday, the woman reiterated her allegations
 mahila ne bataaya, 'mere liye ghatana ko yaad karnaa mushkil tha
 i don't remember that i wrote any good feedback from the tour agency
 maine apni yaadasht durust kii or teen maheene baad july ke ant main maine exiaar darj karaane kaa faisla kiya
 The tour agency and the hotel's first reaction was that they were surprised
 lekin unki is baat kaa pataa lagane main koi dilchaspee nahin thi ki ye sab kyon hua or iske liye jimmedaar koun hai
 He was just worried for his image
 mahila ne bataaya ki ye uske parivaar or doston kaa samarthan hi tha jiske chalate usne cese darj karaayaa
 The teacher told that she contacted an NGO who brought this to the US Embassy and sent my complaint letter to the Police Commissioner of Delhi

 The Delhi Police said she was confused by the name of the NGO - American Overseas Domestic Crisis Violence Center and referred the complaint to the Women's Cell as a case of domestic violence
 november main jab voomens cell ne shikaayat waapas bhej di tab jaakar exiaar darj hui or enjio se mahila kaa bayaan maanga gaya
 Later, the woman was asked to come to India to identify the accused

 cese darj karaane kii prakriya bahut hi niraashajanak he, dilli police jis tarah se maamle ko dekh rahi he, use lekar main aashwast nahin hum
 But i stand by my point and i want justice, and i know that these people must have done the same to some other women

 Later, the woman was asked to come to India to identify the accused

 bjp's Scheduled Caste Morcha president Sanjay Paswan said that Shah will participate in an event to be held in Patna on September 21 to mark the 100th birth anniversary of former Bihar Chief Minister Bhola Paswan Shastri
 sanjay ne kaha ki apni yatra ke dauraan shah varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti taiyaar karne ke liye bihar ke chunavi maahaul kaa bhi jayja lenge
 Shah, who is in the cabinet of BJP general secretary and Narendra Modi, will also take stock of the preparations for the 'hunkar rally' to be organized by the BJP on October 27 in Patna, which Modi will address
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa modi kii pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari kaa lagaataar virodh kiye jane se is raily kii mahatta batch gai he
 Due to Nitish's opposition, BJP avoided calling Modi here for campaigning in favor of NDA candidates in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and Bihar assembly elections of 2010
 maharashtra main gathbandhan ke masale par aakhirkaar shivasena ne bijepi ke aage ghutane tech die hai
 Shiv Sena has announced its support to the BJP on the issue of government formation
 party ne kaha he ki bijepikisi ko bhi mukhyamantri banaaevah use samarthan degi
 However, the party has described Union Minister Nitin Gadkari as its choice
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main uddhav thakare ne likhaa he ki maharashtra kii behatari ke liye vah bijepi ko samarthan dene ko taiyaar he
 Uddhav wrote, 'let anyone be the one who takes the chariot of Maharashtra forward by' sleeping 'with the blessings of the people, Shiv Sena will support him with courage and courage
 galat khabaron ko failaakar shivasena ko badnaam karne kii koshish in dinon jari he
 The happiness of those who are doing so will prove fleeting
 'gauratlab he ki dilli main ravivaar ko pradhanmantrinarendra modi kii 'tii party'ke baad shivasena ke tevar naram pade the
 Shiv Sena quota minister Anant Geete had said at the center that the public has given the mandate to both the parties to work together
 unhone kaha tha ki vah centre main mantri bane rahenge
 Uddhav wrote this editorial in 'saamana' the very next day
 bijepi ko mili safalataa se khush shivasena!somvaar subah prakashit 'saamana' main bijepi ko lekar shivasena ke sur badale-badale najar aae
 Before the election, the party, which called the 'crows of the Crusade' to the BJP, said that they are happy that the BJP will get success
 akhbaar ke sampadakeey main uddhav ne likhaa, 'bijepi ko acchhee safalataa mili iskaa hamen anand he
 Instead of getting power from Congress-nationalist scamsters, BJP is getting it, it is in the interest of the state
 ''modi or shah ko jeet kaa shrey'uddhav ne bijepi kii jeet kaa shrey pradesh bijepi ke netaaon ko dene ke bajaay pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko diya he
 On the issue of Chief Minister, Uddhav wrote, 'many names are coming up for the post of Chief Minister
 lekin antim faisla narendra modi or amit shah hi karenge
 If the BJP seats increased in Maharashtra, the credit goes to Modi and Shah
 ''gadakari ke paas anubhav'uddhav ne likhaa ki shivasena ne kabhi hinduon main bhed nahin kiya
 But the kind of polling that took place in areas of 'elite society' is a matter of concern rather than concern
 unhone likhaa, 'mukhyamantri ko lekar gadakari, fadanvis, jaavdekar, taavade, khadse or pankaja munde kaa naam chal rahaa he
 But there is a competition between Gadkari and Fadnavis
 anubhav or kaaryakshmata par vichaar karne par aaj kii taarikh main gadakari is gunvattta kii kasuti par awwal hai
 He knows Maharashtra well and has a vision for development
 duusari taraf fadanvis ke paas pratyaksh rup se mantri pad kaa anubhav bhi nahin he

 The spectators and players in the packed stadium had the same enthusiasm that was seen in the last league match against Pakistan
 do gol se pichhadane ke baad bharat ne shandaar vaapasi karte hue match ko atirikt samay tak khinch diya
 In that too, the decision went to penalty shootout after the score was tied at 3-3
 isamen bharat ke liye sarvanajit singh, vikram pillai, sandip singh, arjuna halppa or shivendra singh ne gol kiye
 At the same time, for England, Richard Smith, Richard Mantle, Ashley Jackson and Simon Mantle hit the right target, while Glen Kirkham's shot was saved by Bharat Chhetri
 rashtramandal khelon main purush haaki main ab tak padak se achoote bharat kii jeet par muhar lagate hi puraa maidan andolit ho gaya
 The thunderous applause did not stop for long

 Now in the final, India will take on Australia on 14 October, beating New Zealand 6–2
 isse pehle do gol se pichhadi bhartiya team ne chaar minute main do gol karke shandaar vaapasi kii
 For India, Sarwanjeet Singh (19th and 61st minutes) and Vikram Pillai (57th minute) scored goals while England's drag flickers Ashley Jackson (35th and 41st) and Simon Mantle (45th) scored
 nirdhaarit samay tak score 3-3 se baraabar rahane ke baad match atirikt samay main khinch gaya
 India got a penalty corner in the 78th minute but missed the target of Sandeep Singh
 iske do minute baad tushaar khandekar ne gol ke thik saamne aasaan sa mauka ganvaaya
 In the next minute, he missed the target again on the cross he met with Captain Rajpal Singh
 atirikt samay main koi bhi team gol nahin kar saki
 Indians dominated the first half
 bharat ne shuruuaati kshanon main aasaan mauka ganvaaya jab shivendra gol ke saamne gend ko pakad nahin sake
 The first goal for India was scored by Sarvanjeet Singh in the 19th minute
 pehle penlti carnor ko veriation aajamaate hue dhananjay mahadic ne flik kiya lekin englad ke golkeeper james fere ne ise bachaa liya
 Sarwanjeet, who pushed for the corner, inserted the ball from near the goalpost
 iske teen minute baad england ne barabari kaa behad aasaan mauka ganvaaya
 Raab Moore's hit passed near the goalpost but Richard Mantle, standing there, could not quickly touch the ball with a stick and send it towards the goal
 england ne haalanki pehle hi half main aakhri minute main barabari kaa gol dagkar bharat ko manovaigyanik dabaav banane nahin diya
 Veteran drag flicker Jackson scored the goal
 duusare half main england adhik aakraamak najar aayaa or iskaa phayda use 41wein minute main penlti carnor ke rup main mila jise jaikson ne gol main badalakar england ko badhat dilaa di
 Even after taking the lead, England continued to play aggressive hockey
 england ne behtareen veriation dikhaate hue 45wein minute main mili penlti carnor par teesraa gol daaga
 The ball was intercepted and handed to another player who gave the pass to Mantle
 uske tufaani shaat ko bhartiya golkeeper bharat chhetri bachaa nahin sake
 England got another penalty corner three minutes later and this time Chhetri did not miss any
 duusare half main bharat ko pehla penlti carnor 55wein minute main mila lekin anbhavi draig flikar sandip singh kaa nishaanaa chook gaya
 However, two minutes later, Sandeep, playing the lead in India's second goal, gave a long pass from the right flank which Vikram deflected towards the goal
 bharat ne chaar minute ke bheetar doosraa gol dagkar stadium main baari taadaad main jamaa darshakon ko andolit kar diya
 Indian Forward players made a great move while making a dent in the English defense
 goalpost ke saamne captain raajapaal singh chuke lekin baayen post ke paas se sarvanajit ne koi galati nahin kii
 New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner will miss the first Test match against Pakistan in Christchurch
 gharelu match kii taiyaari ke samay unhen kalai main chot lag gai thi, jiske kaaran vah pehle test match se baahar ho gaye hai
 In a statement, New Zealand Cricket has said that an x-ray of their injury has been done in which the fracture has been detected

 ) When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary and in-charge of Maharashtra Saroj Pandey arrived in Mumbai to finalize the strategy for the Lok Sabha elections, the biggest problem faced by him was the increasing distance between the Shiv Sena and BJP cadres
 donon dalon ke cader baatcheet main sirf apni-apni party ko mili siton kaa zikr karte the
 When BJP President Amit Shah came to know about this, he immediately asked Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to look into the matter himself and replace NDA cadre with BJP and Shiv Sena cadres and make Prime Minister Narendra Modi the only face of NDA at the national level
 Keep it fadavis ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ko is baat ke liye raji kiya ki shivasena ke cader bhaajapa kii ranneeti ke mutabik jameen par kaam karen
 This was the major reason that led the NDA to win 41 out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra
 bhaajapa kii ranneeti ko jameen par utaarne main pandey or fadavis ne bharpoor yogadan diya
 The zero tolerance policy of default in the strategy did not allow the anti-incumbency (ncp-congress) to take advantage of the anti-incumbency trend against the BJP in the state, the troubles of the farmers and the anger created by the Dalit movement
 beshak, jis tarah se chunaav se pehle bhaajapa virdohi dal ekajute hue the usamen ankaganit (vot fisad) ke lihaaj se zyaadaatar rajyon main bhaajapa baikfoot par thi
 It seemed difficult, if not impossible, to get 282 seats again, but if the results came, the BJP did well with its previous performance and won 303 seats
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa or ralod kaa gathjod bada ulat-pher kar saktaa he iskaa andeshaa bhaajapa ko bhi tha
 Sources say that the party's concern was with Uttar Pradesh that victory can be achieved here only when the beneficiaries of government schemes are supported and there is no other effective alternative without direct contact
 aise main sanghathan kaushal ke maahir or logon se sampark saadhane main kushal maane jane vaale govardhan jhadpia ko rajya main sah prabharee bana kar bheja gaya
 Along with the beneficiaries, he also targeted people who could be future beneficiaries
 jhadpia kehete hai, ''2014 main bhaajapa ko 43 fisadi vot mili the
 But in the event of a coalition of opposing parties, such a vote was not going to work
 aise main party ne 51 fisadi vot kaa torget kiya
 We kept in touch with other people besides the beneficiaries
 '' pradesh main tainaat kendriya str ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki nerrative tab badal gaya jab 'modi ke mukaable koun' logon main charchaa kaa mukhya mudda ban gaya
 It ran an under-current and the BJP managed to win 62 seats
 amit shah kii is ranneeti ko rajya main govardhan jhadpia or sunil bansal ne safaltaapurvak lagu kiya
 In the neighboring state of Bihar, the BJP fought in 2014 with the LJP and the RLSP
 nitish akele or rajd tathaa congress saath mil kar chunaav lard rahi thim
 The BJP was successful in winning 23 seats
 lekin 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress, jad (you) or rajd ke saath aane se bhaajapa ko badi haar mili
 BJP was less likely to win in 2019 without Nitish
 yahi vajah thi ki bihar main bhaajapa ne jad (you) ko 17 siten deen
 State BJP vice-president Devesh Kumar says that the Mai equation was still in a strong position
 lekin party kii safalataa main pradhanmantri kaa cheharaa sabase taqatvar tha
 At the same time, there was a great synergy between BJP and JD (U) as an organization
 har chunavi sabha main pradhanmantri ko centrebindu main rakhaa gaya
 BJP and JD (U) were successful in convincing the people of Bihar
 yahi vajah rahi ki endie 40 main se 39 seat jeetne main safal rahaa
 The BJP has not interfered in Bengal and Odisha
 lekin is baar in donon rajyon main party ne apni puri takat laga di
 In 2017, when the bjp's Maharashtra executive meeting was held in Odisha, party president Amit Shah made it clear that in 2019, the BJP will achieve great success in both these states
 bhaajapa mahasachiv or bengal ke prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ke saamne sabase badi samasya yah thi ki rajya main bhaajapa ke paas pradesh str par koi kaddavar netaa nahin tha
 In such a situation, for a candidate capable of winning the election, he had to break the people of other parties and join the party
 is ranneeti ko unhone bakhubi anjaam diya
 He was successful in joining Mukul Rai, one of the founding members of TMC and close to Mamta, in the BJP
 baad main raay bhi rajya main bhaajapa kii ranneeti ko anjaam dene main safal rahe
 While Vijayvargiya continued to work on the strategy of separating leftist voters in the state to vote for the BJP to defeat the TMC, Rai broke the tmc's effective leaders and joined the BJP
 rajya main chunaav ko trikoniya (tiemasi, vam or bhaajapa) karne kii jagah do dhruviya karne main vijayawargeey safal rahe or bhaajapa yahaan 42 main se 18 siten jeetne main safal rahi
 In 2014, the BJP could win only two seats here
 odisha main bhaajapa kii ranneeti ko party mahasachiv or rajya ke prabharee arun singh moort rup de rahe the
 Assembly elections were held in Odisha along with the Lok Sabha
 lekin arun singh ne vidhansabha chunaav par focus nahin hone diya
 He focused all attention on the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone bhaajapa kii us ranneeti ko thik tarah se rajya main utaara jiske tahat party ne yah prachaarit kiya ki bhaajapa modi ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye chunaav lard rahi he
 BJD has no one to counter Modi
 bhaajapa yahaan se aath siten jeet gai
 Earlier in 2014, the party won only one seat
 chhattisgarh ke chunaav ko yahaan ke bhaajapa prabharee anil jain ne puri tarah se rashtriya chunaav ke taur par ladaa
 He took full care that in any situation, no atmosphere should be created against any old face of BJP
 iske liye unhone rashtriya netritv ko kisi bhi puraane pratyaashee ko is baar tikat na dene kaa suzav diya
 Neither an old MP or his relative got a ticket in Chhattisgarh, nor former chief minister Raman Singh was given prominence in campaigning
 chhattisgarh se lage madhya pradesh main bhi vidhansabha chunaav main congress baaji maar gai thi
 But the BJP reversed
 purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan yah sunishchit karte rahe ki piem kisaan sakvamaan nidhi sabhi kisaanon ko mili
 He kept in constant contact with booth level workers
 rajya ke bhaajapa prabharee vinay sahasrabuddhe chunavi prabandhan ko jameen par utaarne main safal rahe or bhaajapa yahaan 29 main se 28 seat jeetne main safal rahi
 It is noteworthy that BJP won 25 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan
 yahaan ke chunaav prabharee prakaash javdekar ne rajput or meena votaron ko saadhane kii ranneeti ko safaltaapurvak lagu kiya
 Gurjars were also angry with the Congress because Sachin Pilot was not made CM
 javdekar, vasundhara raaje sindhiya ko is baat ke liye raji karne main safal rahe ki ve chunaav prachaar se dur hi rahen
 Through co-incharge Sudhanshu Trivedi media and seminars, Modi was able to bring the achievements of the government to the enlightened people in the right manner
 unhone sanghathan ke saath talmail kii jimmedaari bakhubi nibhaai or bhaajapa ko safalataa mili
 In Haryana, BJP secured 10 out of 10 seats
 pichley chunaav main bhaajapa yahaan 10 main se sirf 7 siten hi jeet saki thi
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and in-charge Anil Jain were working on the ground to make the BJP a big success here
 khatter ne jahaan labhaarthiyon ke saath sidhaa sampark saadhaa or sanghathan se sidhaa samvaad kiya, vahiin anil jain micro level par chunaav prabandhan kii jimmedaari nibhaate rahe
 The BJP leaders worked on their strategy with silence and the result is in front of everyone
 *** Just as Arvind Kejriwal, wearing the Gandhi cap written by AAP, contested Delhi's power, a similar view was seen in Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 mauka tha jithan ram maanjhi ke ek din kii bhukh hadtaal kaa
 Manjhi, along with her supporters, wearing a Gandhi cap written by us, has sat on a day-long hunger strike to protest the cancellation of decisions taken by Nitish Sarkar in his cabinet
 maanjhi ne haal main hi janata dal united se baghawat kar nai party banaai he jiskaa naam he hindustani awami morcha
 Significantly, Manjhi, during his short tenure, had taken around 34 decisions for the poor, employees, police, teachers and youth, which were canceled by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar a day before Holi

 film tanaji ajay devgan kii 100veen film he iskaa number bhi 1 ban rahaa he jo is film se jud rahaa he ye film ajay devgan ko maan-sammaan or dhan daulat sabakuch dilaaegi
 Why the name of Tanaji's English spelling score is also considered to be of special importance in astrology
 People increase their luck by changing the spellings of the name
 The sum of the spelling of Tanaji is 9 (TANHAJI = 18 = 9) and the name of Ajay Devgan is also 9
 (ajay Devgn = 4 + 5 = 9), number 9 in numerology is considered to be the number of Mars, Mars is considered to be a factor of might, valor, army

 Showrooms and shops were also to be arranged to provide markets

 In which there is considerable itching
 isliye koshish karen ki nahaye to roj lekin bahut garm pani se nahin, gunagune pani se

 ji haa viraat ke banaae lagbhag har record par is ballebaaj kii najar he or wo dhire-dhire unhen apane naam karata ja rahaa he, wo bhi chupchaap bina shor machaae

 iske alaava amala viraat kohli ke sabase kam pariyon main paanch hajaar ran banane ke record ko bhi apane naam kar chuke hai
 While Kohli had played 114 innings to score five thousand runs, Amla once again crossed the five thousand runs mark in just 101 innings, breaking her record

 We have worked in many different areas, have had many talks that have had real results, we hope that this progress will continue
 purv rajdoot ne obama prashasan main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan america or bharat ke sambandhon ko majboot karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Describing the relationship with India as the most important for America in this century, Verma said, "we should not just assume that because things are not going well, we can leave them on our own
" verma ne ek saakshaatkaar main kahaaki unka maananaa he ki raashtrapati donald trump or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bich june main hui baithak acchhee rahi
 He said that he would like to see the relationship between the two countries moving forward in terms of investment in the field of defense
 unhone kaha yah mahatvapurn he ki bharat or america ke bich is tarah ke raksha sambandh ho or ham aadhunik praudyogikiyon ke kshetra main bhi aise hi sambandh banaae jisase bharat ko bhoomi, akaash, samudr yaa antariksh main spardhaa main badhat mil saken
 i think it is very important that India has such capabilities
 verma ne ummid jataai ki america bharat ko die bade raksha saajhedaar ke darje kaa vastav main paalan karegaa jo ki puri tarah nayaa or vishisht he
 The former US ambassador also stressed the goal of bilateral trade of up to $ 500 billion
 unhone kaha america-bharat kii aarthik kahani bahut alag he jisamen kisi bhi paksh ke phaayde se duusare paksh kaa nuksaan nahin he
 If an American company sets up business in India, it does not mean that it will reduce American jobs
 iskaa matlab asia main sambhavat:bazaar ke maukey badhanaa he or mujhe lagata he ki aisa hi america main nivesh karne vaali bhartiya companiyon ke sandarbh main hota he
 He said that the biggest increase in bilateral trade would be in the private sector and focus on areas like technology, innovation and high tech cooperation
 donon deshon ke rishton ke saamne aane vaali chunautiyon ke bare main verma ne kaha ki chunautiyon ke mukaable or kai saare maukey hai
 "I think a lot of change is happening, as you know, we broke every record last year in terms of business, visas and students," he said
 saaf taur par kuch matbhed hai, kuch vipareet paristhitiyaan hai or khaastaur se avrajan ko lekar tathaa main inhen hal hote hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 In response to a question on the H-1B visa issue, Verma said that we have to look at it in this perspective
 unhone kaha america ne pichley saal sambhavat: bhartiya nagarikon ko das lakh se zyada vija jari kiye jinamein se 60 hajaar ech1bi vija the
 India is getting a large share of H1B visas, so we have to look at it in this perspective, although the number of these visas is still very low

" meraa parivaar or main pravasi hum
 We should encourage and celebrate migration and diversity in our country
 isi ke liye america janaa jaataa he
 You must have heard many times about the conspiracy of robbery, murder and any crime of crime by the jailed criminals, but have you heard of any such incident which was done by a criminal in jail himself
 vaardaat kaa ek aisa khulaasa jisko sunakar aap na keval hairaan rah jaaenge, balki pulisia vyavastha par aapkaa bharosa uth jayega
 This day is the biggest robbery incident of the country till date
 bihar ke hajipur main ab tak kii desh kii sabase badi lut ke maamle main jo khulaasa hua he vah bihar police kii us lachar vyavastha kii hakeekat ko ujagar karne vaala he jisaki vajah bihar kii sushasan vaali chhavi tuutati dikh rahi he
 On 23 November 2019 at 12 noon in Hajipur, a boy arrived in the face of the customer at the office of the Gold Loan Company Muthoot Finance at Jagadamba State Apartment on Cinema Road, the busiest market
 aphis kaa darwaja kholane se pehle sicurity main tainaat guard ne ladke kii puri talaashi lee
 After investigation, the guards allowed the boy inside
 aphis ke andar maujuud guard ne get kholaa lekin luteraa aphis main daakhil hone ke bajaay get par is tarah khadaa ho gaya ki guard get band nahin kar sake
 Just then the six robbers came running
 unhone guard ko pakad liya or finance aphis ke andar daakhil ho gaye
 Everyone had pistols in their hands
 aphis main maujuud ek anya guard, company ke karmchaariyon or graahakon ko pistaul kii nok par lene ke baad bekhauf luteron ne gold form ke strong room se sone ke packet nikaale or baigon main bhare
 Within just 20 minutes, the robbers escaped with 55 kg of gold
 muthut finance ke aphis se sona lekar bhaagane ke liye bhi luteron ne shaatiranaa tarika apanaaya
 They did not run away together after plunder, but got out one by one in a while, so that in this crowded market, no one suspected anything like loot
 ek luteraa sar par bore main lut kaa sona lekar is tarah nikalataa dikhaa maano koi aam aadmi ho
 When the robbery was carried out by seven robbers inside the bank, many of the robbers' companions came out with the help of CCTV cameras
 yah luteron ke saathiyon kii byaap team thi
 This robbery was carried out by about 15 to 20 criminals
 dindahaade lut kii is vaardaat ne puure bihar police mahakme ko hilaakar rakh diya tha
 The biggest SIT team has been formed so far to investigate this robbery
 bihar police ke bade adhikariyon kii team hajipur main camp kar vaardaat kii jadon ko talashne main jute gai
 Investigations started but instead of the robbers being exposed, the police began to unleash
 police kii jaanch ne hi police kii naakaamiyon ko ujagar karnaa shuru kar diya
 It was revealed that the negligence of the police had made way for this huge loot to reach the end
 is vaardaat main kisi bhi lutere ne apana cheharaa chupaane kii koshish nahin kii thi
 The robbers had clear faces on CCTV
 so police ko luteron kii pahchaan karne main zyada dikkat nahin hui
 The very next day the police released a poster of 6 robbers
 sisitivi kii tasveeron se pataa chalaa ki bank ke andar jis lutere ne lut ko lead kiya tha vah vaishali jile kaa hi durdaant mukul raay urf priyaranjan he
 In addition to team leader Mukul, three of the seven robbers who were identified from the photographs found during the robbery, Virender Sharma from Vaishali district and the infamous Vikash Jha from Samastipur were already absconding in the gold robbery case
 virender or vikaas jha farvari 2019 main mujffarpur main 32 kilo sone kii lut ke maamle main shaamil the or police kii pakad se baahar the
 Mukul alias Priyaranjan, a mere 17-year-old minor, was notorious because of dozens of criminal cases in the area
 police ne luteron par inaam kaa elaan kar diya
 But as the police proceeded the investigation, a disclosure was made which was difficult for the police to believe
 jis mukul raay urf priyaranjan ko lut kaa team leader bataakar police ne poster jari kiya tha vah jail ke andar tha
 The robber whom the police were looking for, the entire police department was united day and night and was locked in the remand home of Muzaffarpur for three months
 remand home main band is shaatir lutere kii lut ke dauraan kii tasviir saamne aane ke baad police bhaagi bhaagi mujffarpur pahunchi lekin yahaan police ke haath jo jaankaree lagi usase bihar police ke hosh ud gaye
 It was learned that exactly 17 days before the robbery, his vicious Mukul was rescued
 khulaasa hua ki 6 november ko hi aparaadh ke ek maamle main peshi ke liye police mukul ko hajipur court lekar pahunchi thi
 While returning from Hajipur to Muzaffarpur, four robbers of Mukul stopped the police car on the middle road and rescued Mukul at the tip of the pistol
 police ke saamne bada sawaal yah tha ki aakhir kaise faraar hone ke baavjood kisi ko bhi mukul ke faraar hone kii jaankaree nahin thi
 Why no FIR was registered even after such a dreaded criminal escaped
 jis lutere kii tasviir kaa poster banavaakar bihar police logon ko inaam dene kii ghoshnaa kar rahi thi, vah lut ke dauraan police kii filon main salaakhon ke peeche tha
 Actually, as part of the planning of this big robbery, Mukul's colleagues planned to take Mukul out of the clutches of the police about 15 days before the robbery
 yah plan safal rahaa
 The four remand home jawans who were returning from Mukul to Muzaffarpur remand home, returned silently to Muzaffarpur after the prisoner escaped
 mujffarpur remand home ke suprintendent ne mukul ke faraar hone ko lekar vaishali police ko ek chitthee likh dak main daal di
 By the time the Vaishali police got the information and Mukul was absconding, Mukul and his associates had carried out the robbery
 is khulaase ke baad sakate main ai bihar police ne lut ke is mastermind ke faraar hone ke 20 dinon baad or lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke 3 din baad uske faraar hone kii exiaar darj karai
 This loot scandal exposed the entire situation of Bihar Police
 duusare lutere virender sharma kaa poster police ne jari kiya tha
 He is already an accused in the gold robbery case in Muzaffarpur and the police may have forgotten to take the news of his discovery
 duusari vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad police ko uski pehali vaardaat kii yaad ai or mujffarpur police lutere virender sharma ke ghar 9 maheene pehle ke lut maamle kaa ishtehaar lekar pahunchi
 That is, the police were months behind the robbers and the robbers are seen openly challenging the police after committing robbery
 isi maamle main ek anya lutere kii pahchaan kishlay ke taur par hui, jisane is lut se thik nau maheene pehle mujffarpur main 32 kilo sona lut tha
 The accused Kishalaya Muzaffarpur escaped with his family by selling his house land in Bhagwanpur

 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne dilli main rape peeditaaon ke liye bane van stop centre kii badahaali ke liye dilli sarkaar ke afasaron ko jimmedaar bataaya he
 He accused the officers of pressing the file and said that a one-stop center has been started somewhere in Delhi
 11 aspataalon main 1 stop centre kaam kar rahe hai
 Maliwal said on Saturday that Kejriwal has done a lot of work on this but no work has been done in this regard due to the pressing of the files of the officers
 aapako bataa den ki mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay ne kai rajyo main van stop centre shuru bhi kar diya he
 Swati said that the Kejriwal government has decided that the Delhi Women Commission will run the Heaven Stop Center but those files are stuck
 maliwal ne bataaya ki van stop centre main sabhi prakaar kii hinsa se peedit mahilaon va balikaon ko vibhinn suvidhaayen milti hai
 After the Nirbhaya scandal in Delhi in 2012, the government decided to fund Nirbhaya in a hurry
 jiske tahat dushkarm peeditaaon ke liye van stop centre kholane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 State governments decided that rape victims should not go anywhere and get medical, police, psychological, legal and other support under one roof (a center)
 iske liye nirbhaya fund se salanaa 1 hajaar karod rupee die
 After this, in five years, one hundred and fifty centers in the country were registered on paper, but the condition of most of them is bad
 centre kii yojanaon ke anusaar ekal khidki hone ke naate peedita ko sabase pehle yaheen aana hota he
 It is here that the FIR of the victim is to be lodged
 lekin dilli kaa shaayad hi koivan stop centreho jahaan par exiaar darj ho rahi ho
 The guidelines of the One Stop Center say that there should be computers in the center, in which data of victims can be recorded
 iske alaava video conferencing kii suvidha bhi honi chahie
 Let us tell you that in 11 districts of Delhi, Delhi Government runs One Stop Center, for this the Central Government does not take any support nor use Nirbhaya Fund

 building ko todane kaa kaam mangalvaar se hi shuru ho chukaa he
 Recently, Chandrababu Naidu wrote a letter to Jaganmohan Reddy seeking to declare 'praja Vedika' as the official residence of the Leader of Opposition, but his demand was turned down
 'praja vedika ’kaa nirmaan pichhali telegu desham party (tidipi) sarkaar dwaara en chandrababu naidu ke aadhikarik nivas ke bagal main kiya gaya tha

 uttar pradesh ke chunaav kii taarikh jaise-jaise najadik aa rahi he raajnneetik galiyaaron main sargarmi lagaataar bad rahi he
 The list of 403 candidates of Akhilesh Yadav continued to be discussed throughout the day on Monday
 list main apana naam khojane ko party ke vidhayak or mantri baichaiyn dikhe, jo kabhi mulaayam singh ke ghar ke baahar dikhe to kabhi akhilesh ke program main takataki lagaae maujuud rahe
 There was a public discussion among these reports that the Chief Minister has also stated his desire to contest this election, according to sources, Akhilesh Yadav has expressed his desire to contest from two seats of Bundelkhand
 sutron kii maane to bundelkhand ke mahoba kii charkhaari or lalitpur kii babina seat akhilesh yadav ne apane liye rakhi he
 However, Akhilesh Yadav has already publicly expressed his desire to contest from Bundelkhand too
 akhilesh ne kyon chunaa bundelkhand ?jin do siton ke naam saamne aaen hai un siton par kabhi samaajawaadee party nahin jiti he, saath hi sapa bundelkhand main kamjor maani jaati he
 It is worth noting that Bundelkhand is considered to be the most backward and poor area of uttar Pradesh, farmers' suicide in Bundelkhand is on a high level
 akhilesh yaheen se apni nai pahchaan gadhana chaahate he jo unhen pita or parivaar ke aabhamandal se bhi baahar karegaa
 An attempt to create a separate identity is a big objective to write Bundelkhand in front of his seat in this list, Akhilesh Yadav is not only flirting with his father's political halo, but wants to come out of the tag of Etawah, Mainpuri and Saifai Create a separate identity
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadambhi tak vidhanparishad main he lekin vidhayak banakar us ilaake se pratinidhitiv karnaa chaahate he jahaan samaajawaadee party lagbhag jiro se shuru hogi or yahi koshish he ki wo apane dam par apni aage kii raajnneeti kar sake
 It is clear that this is a big political bet of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, which has a lot of scope to sit properly
