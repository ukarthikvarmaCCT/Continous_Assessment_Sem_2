 15 june ko puri ke alag-alag gaanv main jab main gum rahaa tha, tab maine yah nahin sochaa tha ki log cyclone phoni ke 45 dinon ke baad bhi sangharsh kar rahe honge
 When my car left for the krishna-prasad block, about 120 km from Bhubaneswar, i had many questions
 meri gaadi jab dhire-dhire aage badhati gai, sabhi sawaalon ks jawaab milte gaye
 Seeing the scattered trees and broken houses all along the way, i understood how dangerous Cyclone Phony was
 sabase pehle ham krishna-prasad block ke balbhadrapur gaanv pahunche, hamaari gaadi dekhte hi log sab jamaa ho gaye
 People felt that perhaps someone from the government has come to help, but their confusion gradually disappeared
 mere kit bag jis par enditivi likhaa hua tha use dekhte hi logon ne samaj liya main media se hum
 a youth took me to where the Scheduled Castes live
 jane ke raste main mujhase poocha ki aap enditivi se hai? maine haa main jawaab diya
 On the way he said if i would really show his problem, i said i will try
 uskaa kahana tha vahaan kuch din pehle neshnal media vaale aaye the, lekin afasar se baat karke chale gaye
 Did not show the problems of the people
 uski baton se mujhe pataa chal gaya ki media ko lekar logon main gussa he
 This anger is also legitimate
 phoni cyclone ke baad inaki samasya ko lekar jo reporting honi chahie thi, wo nahin hui
 Most journalists left the cyclone as the air weakened
 un patrakaron ne cyclone ke prabhaav kaa logon kii maut se maaptul karte rah gaye
 If there is not much death, there is no effect of cyclone
 agar patrakaron kii yahi soch he to phir patrakarita khatm he
 After 45 days, the effect of cyclone is the same as it was on the first day
 chaliye asli mudde par aate hai, yuva pravesh kumaar ne mujhe anusuchit jati kii basti main pahunchaa diya
 Scheduled caste people have been pushed into a corner in this colony
 duusare rajyon ke bare main to mujhe pataa nahin lekin odisha ke zyaadaatar gaanv main anusuchit jati ke log gaanv ke aakhri main rahete hai yaa phir kisi kone main
 My village is in the same situation
 in anusuchit jati ke toote hue ghar ko dekhakar main chaunk gaya
 The roof of the house has blown away
 ghar ke andar koi saamaan nahin he
 The wall is broken
 reeta maalik mujhe uskaa ghar dikhaane le gai
 As if entering inside the house, some idols of God and some clothes are kept in the name of the saw
 reeta maalik ne bataaya ki raat ko ghar main nahin, baahar soti hai
 He is still afraid that the broken wall may fall over
 balbhadrapur main meri mulaakaat kaveri malik se hui
 The age must have been around 30 years
 kaveri apana chote se bachche ko god main lekar mitti ke chuulhe par khaanaa bana rahi thim
 The Kaveri owner said that he was not given accommodation at the Cyclone Center
 tabaahi main bhi kuch logon ko yaad rahaa ki ve swarna hai or ve yah ahsaas karana nahin bhuule ki kuch log anusuchit jati ke hai
 Kaveri ran away from one place to another with her small child
 teen dinon tak khaanaa nahin mila
 Finally found a place in a school
 kaveri ne bataaya, 'jab cyclone shuru hua to ham log cyclone centre gaye
 There were many people in the center but still there was some space left
 hamen jagah nahin di gai
 We were told that we are Scheduled Caste people
 phir ham skool chale gaye
 In school we starved for two and a half days
 vahaan na lite thi, na khaanaa tha
 there was nothing
 meraa chota baccha tha, use bukhaar hua lekin vahaan koi dawaai nahin thi
 Asha had given the number but did not pick up the phone
 abhi bhi yahaan chuaachhut kaa bhav bahut zyada he
 When they go to the shop, they are not touched, children go to school, they are seated separately
 khaanaa khaane jate hai to alag se baithaate hai
 Male people also do not touch us
 ham log gaanv ke kone main rahete hai, ham logon ko koi nahin choota
 No one comes to us' i was stunned to hear Kaveri's talk
 mujhe yaad he jaise hi main vahaan se nikal rahaa tha tab kaveri kah rahi thi jatipratha khatm honi chahie
 She also asked if his blood is black and the other's red
 kaveri kii baat sunakar mere man main ek sawaal bhi aayaa ki bhagwaan jagannatha ke ilaaka puri main yah jatipratha itani zyada kyon he? jab bhagwaan jagannatha khud sabhi jati or sabhi dharm ke bhagwaan he, sab unka darshan karte hai, rathyatra ke dauraan sab unke rath ko choote hai to phir oonchi jati ke log jis jagannatha ko apana bhagwaan maanate hai
 Why could not you learn anything from that God
 cyclone phoni ne yahaan ke logon ke rojgaar bhi chin liye hai
 They were selling goods made from bamboo but many people do not have money to buy bamboo
 kamai aadha ho gai he
 After Balbhadrapur village, our train started moving towards other villages
 ham bhoisai gaanv pahunchate hai
 The condition of this village is more frightening
 jaise hi pataa chalaa ham news channel se aae hai, sab apana-apana ghar dikhaane ke liye baichaiyn ho gaye
 The roof of most people's houses was blown here
 shanti paahan apana ghar dikhaane ke liye le gai
 Shanti Pahan's roof is completely blown away
 shanti paahan ne ek bans kaa asthai ghar to bana liya he, lekin ghar main bijli nahin he
 Shanti Pahan works in Dhibari
 thodi duuri par basant paahan kaa ghar he
 Basant is not Pahan's husband
 cyclone ke kaaran diwaar tut kar sar par aa giri, abhi bhi sir par bandes laga hua he
 Even after 45 days, Basant has not been able to save her household items
 unki madad ke liye koi nahin he
 Has a son who is very young
 basant ko raahat ke naam par ek hajaar or kuch chaaval mila, lekin to kabaka khatm ho gaya
 Basant said that if she does not get help, then she will die, due to a broken head she is unable to work herself
 kai aise log mili jo cyclone ke shikaar hue hai
 If someone's waist was broken, someone's leg was broken
 inhen medical madad kii jarurat he
 The people of Bhoihashi took me to the place where food is cooked together
 yahaan ek choti si kutiyaa bani hui he
 This is what the children of the village study during the day because the school has been torn down by cyclone
 is kutiyaa ke paas khaanaa banataa he
 Rice named after Khana, called Bhat and Dalma in Odia
 dalma kaa matlab daal main sabji daal di jaati he
 No separate vegetables have to be made
 is gaanv main sabhi log khaanaa khaane ke liye ikattha hote hai
 Food is not cooked separately in anyone's home
 yahaan ke logon ne mujhe bataaya ki gaanv ke log sirf ek baar khaanaa khate hai wo bhi teen baje ke kareeb kyon ki thodaa der khaanaa khaaenge to raat ko bhukh nahin lagegi
 Even if you feel hungry, you eat biscuits and bangle
 agar aap soch rahe hai ki khaanaa sarkaar khilaa rahi he to aap galat soch rahe hai
 Not the food government but the u Mumba Kabaddi team of Mumbai is feeding
 roni scruwala kii yah team he jo roj yahaan ke 1200 logon ko khaanaa khilaati he
 We did not know that any such team is working quietly
 desh ne cricket ko kitna diya, kabddi ko kitna kam mila
 But as much as Kabaddi, by its part, is doing something for these people
 yah dekh kar kise acha nahin lagegaa
 i liked it very much
 is cyclone kii vajah se banjaaraa samudaay ko bhi baari nuksaan jhelana padaa
 Two Banjara families live in the corner of Bhoihashi village
 inke paas na to jameen he, na ghar, jahaan jagah mil jaati he vahiin tambu lagaakar ruk jate hai
 They do not have identity cards, nor certificates
 isiilie inhen raahat saamagree bhi nahin milti
 Rajalakshmi Das told me that she has been roaming from place to place with her children for the last 20 years
 rajalakshmi ke paas na jameen he naa ghar
 During the cyclone, when the people of the village refused to give support, Rajalakshmi saved her children's life by hiding in school
 rajalakshmi ne bataaya ki cyclone ke dauraan khaane ke liye kuch nahin tha
 For three days, my children hunger away from biscuits and chocolate
 cyclone ke dauraan dukaan tut gai thi, raste main biscuit or chocolate gira hua tha
 Rajalakshmi was collecting all this and giving it to her children
 to aap samaj sakate ki cyclone ke dauraan in logon kii haalat kya thi? cyclone to jati nahin dekhtaa he, dharm nahin dekhtaa he, sab ko barbaad kar detaa he
 If everyone was harmed, then why not provide relief material to these people? After Bhohasahi, we left for Arkuda village
 chilka jhil yahaan ke lakhon machuaaron ke liye roji roti kaa jariya he
 Everything was snatched away after the cyclone
 arakud gaanv ke 1200 machuaare parivaar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 All these boats have broken in Cyclone
 naav nahin he to ab kaam bhi nahin he
 The government has said that it will pay to build the boat, but so far nothing has been received
 in machuaaron ne bataaya ki ek naav banane main 40 se 50 hajaar kharch ho jate hai
 It takes more than two months to build a boat
 aise main inhen kab paisa milegaa kab apni naav thik karenge yah chintaa kii baat he
 Social worker Sandeep Patnaik said that the people of Arkuda village depend completely on Chilka
 patnayak kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne licency naavon ko paisa dene ke liye kiya he, lekin jin machuaaron ke paas license nahin he unka kya hoga
 Patnaik also told that many organizations come here to give relief, but seeing so many people, they run away
 in sab gaanv main agar main nahin jaataa to logon kii samasya ke bare mujhe pataa nahin chal paata
 i have been to only a few villages but this is the story of almost every village in this block
 har gaanv main koi na koi nai samasya he, koi nai kahani he
 i came to know that there is a lot of drinking water problem in many villages
 log ganda pani pi rahe hai
 i did not have time to go to that village
 andhera ho gaya tha
 There was no light in these villages
 asi vaale studio main baithkar hindu muslim ke topic par bahes karne vaale ankaron ko bhi logon kii in samasyaon par dhyaan dena chahie
 If the media fails to show the problems of the people, then journalism is over
 media kaa matlab tiarapy nahin he
 If you want to see TRP, then keep debiting ten people sitting in the studio, but remember that there will come a time when you will have everything but that will not be the journalism that you are advancing

 com / ysdq9ckf1m— Chennai Super Kings (@chennaiipl)april 20, 2019is video main harbhajan singh lungi pahane pehle ek lathi ke saath kalabaziyaan karte najar aate hai
 They fasten it around their bodies with sticks in their hands
 isi bich duusari lathi bhi unke haath main pahunch jaati he or wo donon laathiyon ko teji se ghumana shuru karte hai
 Seeing them, many players of the team try to do this acrobatics but all fail
 sarkaar kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood teen talaak ke maamle khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 a case of triple talaq has come out of Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh, which is quite surprising
 darasal, jis mahila ko uske pati ne saath rakhane se manaa kar diya use uske sasur ne apane saath rahane ke liye ofer kiya he
 The husband of a woman living in Kanshiram colony of Bareilly district, hiding the matter of being married beforehand, married
 uske baad patni ke garbhvatee hone par marpet karke use ghar se nikaal diya
 When the woman repeatedly requested her mother to come back to her husband's house, after six months, the accused husband gave her three divorces over the phone
 is dauraan mahila ne ek beti ko janm diya
 When she reached her in-law's house after the daughter was born, Shauhar refused to adopt her
 pati ke saamne gidgidaane ke baad bhi jab vah nahin pighla topiditaapane sasur ke paas guhaar lagane pahunchi
 The father-in-law said that he would not keep it with me
 iske baad peedita ne esaspi offis main nyaay kii guhaar lagaai
 At present, the police has started investigating the matter
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jaanch ke baad doshiyon ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi
 Let me tell you that recently, a case of three divorces was reported from Pahareha village of Kharela police station area of mahoba district of UP
 jisamen ek muslim yuvak ne roti jal jane par apni bivi ko ‘teen talaak’ bolkar ghar se nikaal diya tha
 The woman gave a complaint letter in this case
 jiske baad maamle main gharelu hinsa kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiye jane kaa aadesh thane ko diya gaya tha
 Apartheid is prevalent everywhere, in every country
 film or tivi industry bhi isse achoote nahin hai
 There are often reports of apartheid
 aisa hi kuch hua he jhaansi kii rani ulka gupta ke saath
 Prem Chopra, who surprised Tannishtha Chatterjee on the apartheid case, was in the lead role in the serial Rani of Jhansi
 unhone ek akhbaar se baatcheet ke dauraan bataaya ki 7 saal kii umr main unhen rangabhed kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 When Priyanka Chopra, who was a victim of apartheid in America, Ulka started her career as a child artiste on the small screen with a 'silk sting' at the age of 7
 haalanki yah sho tiarapy kam hone kii vajah se chah maheene main hi of air chalaa gaya
 'parched' fame Tannishtha Chatterjee, who gave a mockery of her dark complexion on a comedy show, said, 'I was very fond of acting since childhood
 lekin bahut choti umr main hi mujhe industry ke dark said kaa pataa chal gaya
 After the 'silk stings' were over, my father and i went to give auditions
 lekin us samay mujhe yah jaankaar badi niraashaa hui thi ki producers gori ladki kii talash main the

 lapten The risk of air pollution not only physical but also mental illnesses, Bipolar disorder and depression in people with poor air quality is very dangerous for polluted air or poor air quality health
 vaayu pradooshan kaa sabase zyada asar bujurgon, bacchon or garbhvatee mahilaon kii sehat par padataa he
 Apart from damaging the lungs, air pollution is also causing many mental illnesses
 haal hi main hui ek study main is baat kaa khulaasa haa he
 a study was done on the basis of health data of millions of patients in the US and Denmark
 study main donon deshon main ek jaisi beemaari hone kii baat kahi gai he
 University of Chicago and lead researcher of this study, André Razatsky, said that although there are many reasons for mental illness, air pollution has emerged as a new cause
 haalanki is study kii aalochana bhi kii ja rahi he or logon ne is vishay par or research karne kii salaah di he
 At the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 7 million people die every year from air pollution
 aapako bataa den kii vaayu pradooshan ke maamle main bharat bhi bahut kharaab sthiti main hai khaastaur se dilli-ensiaar kii air quality lagaataar girti chali ja rahi he
 PM2 in Delhi

 The air quality index of Delhi NCR has gone above 300, which is a alarm bell

 Learn the right ways to relieve stress sukna bhoomi ghotaalaa maamle main court marshall kaa saamana kar rahe leftinent general pike rath ne dilli ucch nyaayalay main aarope lagaaya he ki unke up sena pramukh namit kiye jane ke baad purvi kaman ne sirf durbhaavpurn iraadon ke tahat unke khilaaf karrwai karne liye kadam uthaaya he
 Rath has argued in his petition in the High Court here that he has been targeted in this case and the charges leveled against him were already decided
 rath ne brihaspativaar ko daayar kii gai 24 prishthon kii apni yachika main kaha he ki cabinet kii niyukti maamalon kii samiti dwaara unhen up sena pramukh ke pad par pronnat karne ko manjuuri diye jane ke baad sena pramukh ke rup main namit leftinent general wike singh ke netritv main purvi kaman ne unke khilaaf ‘court of inkvyri’ kaayam karne ke liye kadam uthaaya he
 He has argued that just before he took over as the Deputy Chief of Army Staff, ordering him to be associated with the headquarters in Kolkata is highly discriminatory and arbitrary
 rath ne wike singh kii bhoomika par chhintakashi karte hue kaha, ‘‘yachikakarta ko ‘deputy chif of army staff’ kaa pad bhaar grahan karne se rokane ke liye durbhaavpurn niyat ke saath sambaddh karne kaa aadesh jari kiya gaya
 Rath, along with former military secretary Lt Gen Awadhesh Prakash, is facing court martial in the case under which the army has hired a private real estate businessman to convert 71 acres of land adjacent to Sukna military cantonment in Darjeeling to become an educational institution
 No objection certificate was issued
 rath ne kaha he ki yachikakarta ke khilaaf lagaaye gayi aarope purv nirdhaarit the or yahaan tak ki yachikakarta ko sena niyamon ke tahat apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karne kaa mauka diye bagaiyr ye aarope lagaaye gayi
 He said that while the other officers found guilty in this case continue in their posts, they were removed from the 33rd Corps Commander
 gauratlab he ki yadi sena kii jaanch main rath ko doshi paaya jaataa he to unhen court marshall kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he, jabaki prakaash sahit anya adhikariyon ko isse apekshaakrit naram kadam arthath prashasnic karrwai kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The odds of coming to power are different from the tactics of staying in power
 satta main aane se zyada badi chunauti satta main bane rahanaa hoti he
 If riding on the waves of expectations and coming to power, then this challenge becomes much bigger
 ek aisi chunauti jahaan har pal imtihaan dena hota he or har kasuti par khara utarana hota he
 a lapse can hit the ground from the sky
 jaise dilli main bijepi ke saath hua
 But the BJP is going back in a different way from Bengaluru
 wo satta kii swaabhaavik party banane ke raste par he
 There is a natural party of power where there is a common, powerful leader
 sarkaar or party uske haathon main hoti he
 Where the tone of protest, disagreement or dissatisfaction remains buried
 party kaa sanghathan vishaal hota jaataa he
 The party becomes such a machine to win elections, which is engaged in this work day and night
 uski gatishiltaa is vishalkay sanghathan ko ek hi disha main khinchati jaati he
 The aim is to stay in power and gain maximum power
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki party sarvocch he
 Government is only a means to fulfill the objective
 bijepi aaj das karod sadasyon ke saath duniya kii sabase badi party he
 The Modi government, which has won a majority on its own, has completed ten months
 party or sarkaar ke bich kahin takaraav nahin he
 Voices were raised from the party and the Sangh Parivar on issues of land acquisition and alliance with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin bengalooru ke baad kah diya gaya he ki party sarkaar ke tamaam faislon kaa puraa samarthan karti he
 After initially objecting to land acquisition, the party is now ready to campaign in its favor across the country
 bengalooru kaa sandesh saaf he- modi sarkaar ke das maheene ke kaamkaaj se bijepi behad khush he
 BJP supports every decision of Modi government
 sarkaar or bijepi par narendra modi kaa puraa niyantran he
 The party leaders, who draw attention from the achievements of the government by making headlines in the media with rhetorical statements and antics, are preparing for strict action
 modi ab party or sarkaar ke sarvocch netaa hai
 The atal-advani era was once over, but now the curtain has completely fallen on it
 sarkaar apane agenda par aage chalegi to party sanghathan ko majboot karne ke kaam main juty rahegi
 In states where all power is weak, all the power will be put there
 bihar ke chunaav kaaphi kuch tay kar denge
 If the results are desired there will be the task of strengthening the ground with enthusiasm in the elections of Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 magar bihar kaa jhatka party ke saath-saath sarkaar ke liye bhi dikkatein paidaa kar degaa
 The kind of support a strong leader needs from his party, Modi has got the same support in Bengaluru
 baithak ke samaapan bhaashan main unhone kaha ki 'ham badlaav laane main kaamyaab hue hai
 This change has been made possible only by our team

 Everything does not seem to be going well between the three parties running the Grand Alliance government in Bihar

 Last week, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad questioned Nitish's decisions
 jiskaa jawaab ab nitish ne diya he
 Addressing party workers, Nitish said that his party does not need to learn anything from the Congress and does not dream of becoming Prime Minister on the strength of 18-20 mps
 ve is bich congress par bhi palatwaar karte hai ki congress ne pehle gandhi ko choda or phir nehru ko bhi tyaag diya
 Earlier, Nitish Kumar and his party where the NDA Presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind were determined to support

 At the same time, JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh is saying that Nitish Kumar can participate in this rally on the invitation of Lalu Prasad
 haalanki unki party ab bhi is raily se dur hi rahane kii baat hawa main he
 Nitish Kumar called himself out of the pm's race, where Nitish was with the BJP before Nitish Kumar appeared in the NDA presidential candidate
 vahiin ve ab GST ke saath bhi najar aa rahe hai
 His doing so is also uncomfortable for the RJD and Congress, which run the Grand Alliance government in Bihar
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad is par nitish kumaar par paroksh rup se hamalaa bhi bol chuke hai
 Will Nitish join the rally on Lalu's invitation? It is said that no one or anyone is alien in politics
 jadyu ke pravaktaa sanjay singh ke bayaan se to kuch aisa hi spasht hota he
 They say that Lalu Prasad's call can go to Parnitish Kumarraili
 haalanki ve ise mahagathbandhan kii raily ke bajaay rajd kii raily kehete hai or congress par kabhi hamalaa na karne kii baat bhi kehete hai
 He also says that his party is not a hanger of any other party
 ve apni party ke agenda or policy ke hisaab se chalate hai or duusare netaa nitish kumaar ke peeche chal sakate hai

 In the Lok Sabha on July 23, there were strong reactions from the concerned parties on the two labor reforms bills introduced by the government
 haalanki code on vegej bill, 2019 sansad main paarit ho gaya, lekin ek anya bill—akyapational sexti, health and varking condishans (oeechadblusi) code, 2019—nichle or ucch donon hi sadanon main atak gaya
 Looking at it from above, both these bills are going to ensure the welfare of the workers and also make the business easy
 code on vegej bill main paarishramik (vetan) or bonus bhugtan ke niyamon ko behatar banane kii baat kahi gai he
 Apart from this, making a minimum wage mandatory at the national level is also included
 oeechadblusi kaa uddeshy kaam karne kii sthitiyon ko behatar bananaa he
 In November 2018, the International Labor Organization stated that 31 percent of Indian workers were working in poor conditions, while 41 percent of them said they were paid very little
 iske chalate asia pacific kshetra ke 22 deshon main bharat kaa sthaan dayaneey rup se kaaphi neeche 19waan tha
 It was being publicized about these bills that the government wants to simplify the complex labor laws of the country as well as reform them
 udhaaharan ke liye alag-alag kanoonon ke tahat akele 'vetan' kii hi 11 paribhaashaayen hai
 The new proposed law will incorporate all the central laws into four codes (codes) - pay, industrial relations, social security and industrial security and welfare
 code on vegej bill chaar kendriya shram kanoonon—vetan bhugtan kanoon 1936, nunatam vetan kanoon 1948, bonus bhugtan kanoon 1965 or samaan paarishramik kanoon 1976—ko apane andar samahit kar letaa he
 OSHWC combines 13 laws together including factory law, contract labor (regulation and abolition) law, interstate migrant labor law, and many other laws especially bidi workers, cinema workers, construction workers, plantation workers, motor Laws governing transport laborers, sales promotion employees and working leaflets are included in this

 Industry watchers have praised these two bills and said that this is a good step towards easing business in India

 Former Rajya Sabha member and Left-backed Center of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) general secretary Tapan Sen says that the Code on Wages bill does not provide any formula for fixing the minimum wage so that it is the discretion of the Central Advisory Board But it has been abandoned
 iske alaava sarkaar ne din main kaam karne ke ghanton ko simit karke aath ghanta kiye jane kii sifarish ko bhi khaarij kar diya he
 He says that the provisions relating to minimum wages have been described as applicable only to 'employees' and not to 'workers'
 unhen alag paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 But Jeet Singh Mann, an expert on labor laws, says that the owners or employers of companies cannot take advantage of such word games

 Surprisingly, the code mentions a provision on "employees below 15 years of age"
 bhaatia or kumaar ke anusaar, ''ise bal shram ko vaidhanik banane kii disha main ek kadam ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he

 According to Mann, "it is very worrying that there is no protection available for the employee who wants to complain against the employer
" '' ve kehete hai ki code on vegej bill, 2019 kii dhara 20 main praavdhaan he ki koi karmchaaree agar bina soochna ke ek din bhi anupasthit rahata he to niojak aath din kaa vetan kaat saktaa he
 They say that this provision goes beyond 'no work, no salary', in which the employer is allowed to steal the salary of the employees
 upie sarkaar ne sabase pehle shram kanoonon ko chaar code main samahit karne kaa vichaar kiya tha, lekin is prastaav ko aage badhaane ke liye sansad main unke paas paryaapt sankhya nahin thi

 lekin 16veen loksabhaa bhang ho jane ke baad is bill kaa samay khatm gaya
 After this a new bill was prepared and introduced to which several recommendations made by the Standing Committee were added

 dollar ke mukaable rupee main giravat kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 After this decline, the Central Government and the Central Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are now beginning to express their concern about the falling rupee level
 jahaan beete kuch maheenon ke daurandollarake mukaable rupee ko sanbhaalane ke liye arabiai dwaara dollar bechney or sona kharidne kii kavayad zyada kargar nahin sabit ho rahi he vahiin ab sutron ke mutabik kendriya rigerv bank ab apravasi bharatiyon (enarai) kii madad lene kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Significantly, the foreign exchange reserves of the country have decreased sharply due to the efforts of the central banks to sell dollars in the international currency market to handle the rupee
 arabiai ke aankadon ke mutabik jahaan april madhya tak bharat kaa 427 billian dollar kaa videshi mudra bhandar tha vahiin ab yah 400 billian dollar ke paas aa chukaa he
 In addition, the Central Reserve Bank recently revealed in its annual report that it has 8 in its gold reserves
 46 metric ton kaa ijapha kiya he
 According to the report, RBI made this purchase during the financial year 2017-18
 is kharidari se maujuuda samay main rigerv bank ke khajaane main 566
 There is a stock of 23 metric tonnes of gold and according to the Reserve Bank, this purchase has been done to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves
 mudra bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki kendriya bank kii yah kavayad bhi rupee ke girte str ko sahaara dene ke liye thi lekin is kadam kaa bhi koi khaas asar rupee kii chaal par dekhne ko nahin mila
 If GST is implemented, petrol, diesel will come from 89 to 60 liters immediately
 50 Kalihaja Now the Central Government and the Central Reserve Bank are preparing to resort to Indian nationals living abroad to curb the fall of the rupee
 is kadam se sarkaar ko ummid he ki vah apane chaalu khaataa ghate ko kam kar sakegi
 It is worth noting that the central bank had earlier taken the help of non-resident Indians during 2013 and was able to handle the steady decline in the rupee against the dollar
 arabiai ke aankadon ke mutabik is dauraan manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar auki kendriya bank ne apravasi bharatiyon se lagbhag 34 billian dollar ke mulya kaa karency swap kiya tha or rupee kii giravat ko rokane main safalataa pai thi
 Through this scheme, RBI buys dollars from Indian citizens sitting abroad at cheap rates
 gauratlab he ki bank of america meril lynch (bophaemail) kii brokerej form sielese ne bhi vakaalat kii he ki rupee ko sanbhaalane ke liye bharat ek baar phir 2013 kii tarah dollar diposit skim (enarai bond) kaa sahaara lete hue 30 se 35 billian dollar bator sakati he
 While this step will curb the rupee depreciation, the central government will also help reduce its current account deficit
 kyon gir rahaa rupaya?america or china ke bich jari trade war or iske chalate vaishvik str par logon kaa dollar par badhata bharosa rupee kii is giravat ke liye sabase bade kaaran bataae ja rahe hai
 Globally, due to this trade war, the world's confidence in the dollar is constantly increasing and the dollar is going to be fiercely bought
 vahiin duniyabar main ubharate bazaaron kii mudraon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa rahaa he
 New Pakistan understood China's CPEC bets, what will Imran do? Experts also say that while the Turkish currency's lira continues to be a crisis for the currencies of Europe as a whole, the decline in the currencies of Europe faces the emerging economies The crisis is overshadowed
 iske alaava vaishvik str par kachche tel kii keemton main jari teji bhi in arthvyavasthaaon kii mudraon ke liye gambhir chunauti pesh kar rahi he
 What is the loss to the common man? In the global market of rupee, the direct impact on the common man
 behad saral shabdon main is asar ko kaha jaae to bazaar main sab kuch mahangaa hone lagata he
 The fall in the price of rupee makes it expensive for the common man to spend holidays abroad, buy foreign cars, buy smartphones and study abroad
 iske chalate desh main mahangaai dastak dene lagati he
 Products of everyday need begin to be expensive
 aap kah sakate hai ki dollar ke mukaable rupee kaa lagaataar kamjor hone aam aadmi ke liye roti, kapadaa or makaan ko mahangaa kar detaa he
 At the same time, due to the weakening of the rupee, home loan also becomes expensive for the common man
 lihaaja, saaf he ki jab dollar ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat kaa daur jari he to yah vakt nae home lone lene kaa nahin he
 In addition, the country's imports become expensive due to the weak rupee
 aise vakt main jab kachche tel kii keemten pehle se hi sheersh str par chal rahi hai, kamzorrupayasarkari khajaane par adhik boj daalata he or sarkaar kaa chaalu khaataa ghaataa bad jaataa he
 RBI has no option? There is a general perception that the Reserve Bank has an important role in the printing of rupee as well as trading the rupee in the global money market
 dollar ke mukaable rupee kii maujuuda giravat ko dekhte hue india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki rigerv bank ke paas rupee kii chaal ko sanbhaalane ke liye ab koi vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Anshuman said that the present situation is also complicated because now even if the Reserve Bank takes some steps to save the rupee, it will not succeed because the rupee is completely dependent on the global situation, over which we have no control of the RBI or the government
 is
 rupye kii pitayee ke liye jimmedaar koun?kisi desh kii mudra uski arthvyavastha kii sehat ko spasht karti he
 Economic experts believe that the government of that country has the biggest responsibility to operate the currency
 vahiin bhartiya rupee main jari giravat par bijness today ke sampadak rajeev dube kaa kahana he ki rupee ko aisi sthiti se bachaane ke liye kendra sarkaar ko desh main export ko badhaane ke saath-saath epadiai or epapiai main ijapha karana hoga
 According to Dubey, this work is not done in the current situation but during a long period
 yadi desh main aarthik susti kaa maahaul nahin hota ko rupaya dollar ke mukaable is sthiti main nahin fansaa hota
 Hence, to remove the rupee from the current situation, there is a need for large foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment in the country along with a large increase in exports
 rajeev kaa maananaa he ki yadi in teenon front par sarkaar ne beete kuch varshon ko dauraan behatar kaam kiya hota to rupye maujuuda sthiti main nahin pahunchaa hota

 samaajawaadee party kii saansad or amitabh bachchan kii patni jaya bachchan mangalvaar ko rajyasabha main buree tarah naaraaz ho gayi
 His complaint was because of the uproar on Uttarakhand, no other issues are being discussed
 unhone rajyasabha ke upasabhapati pije courian se kaha, yah baat thik nahin he ki jo partiyaan hallaa hangaamaa karti hai unhen to bolne kaa mauka mil jaataa he lekin jo log shanti se apni baari kii pratiksha karte hai unka number hi nahin aata
 Actually, Jaya Bachchan has given notice for a long time to discuss issues related to women
 mangalvaar ko jab vah is maamle par bolnaa chaahati thi to congress ke saansadon ne wel main aakar uttarakhand ke maamle par hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On not getting a chance to speak, Jaya Bachchan was uprooted and asked the Deputy Chairman whether she would get a chance only when she would also come wearing a purple jacket? His reference was to Congress MP Shantaram Naik, who was wearing a purple jacket and shouting slogans in the Rajya Sabha's well
 jaya bachchanane sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri par bhi taana kar ksaa, or up sabhapati pije courian se kaha ki aapke paas congress ke nae netaa seetaram yechuri kii baat sunne ke liye to samay he lekin meri baat sunne ko aap taiyaar nahin he
 Kurien tried to pacify Jaya Bachchan, but the Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned till Wednesday before Jaya Bachchan could get a chance to speak
 notebandi ko buudhvaar ke din ek saal puraa hone ja rahaa he
 While the government is not tired of describing the decision of demonetisation as historic, the opposition is preparing to celebrate 'black Day'
 sarkaar or vipaksh kii is rassakashi ke bich is sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhna jaruri he ki notebandi se desh ne kya khoyaa or kya paaya?notebandi ke elaan ke vakt sarkaar ne jorshor se daawa kiya tha ki ye kadam ‘les-cash’ iconomi kii disha main badi chalaang he or isse digital india kii buniyaad majboot hui he
 It was also claimed that black money would come out of it
 jin logon ne paisa idhar-udhar rakhaa hua tha, wo sab baahar nikaalane ko majaboor ho gaye
 After all, how much truth is there in these claims? First of all, talk about cash less transactions
 bhartiya rigerv bank kii sanstha neshnal pements corporation of india (NPCI) desh main hone vaale sabhi tarah ke digital bhugtan kii nigaraanee rakhane vaali sabase badi sanstha he
 According to NPCI data, after demonetisation, the country is adopting digital transactions very fast
 masalan- saal 2017 -2018 main oktober tak hi digital tranjection 1000 karod rupye tak pahunch gaya
 The pace of increase can be gauged from the fact that in the last full financial year i
e
 2016 - 2017, there was so much digital transaction
 anumaan he maujuuda vitt varsh khatm hone tak digital tranjection bad kar 1800 crores rupye ho jayega
 - npci-made UPI (united Payment Interface) has proved to be very effective in the direction of digital economy
 UPI digital pement ke liye logon kaa pasandida platform ban gaya he
 From banks to e Wallet, all are increasingly adopting UPI
 ab tak NPCI ke apane ap BHIM ke alaava 57 bank isse jud chuke hai
 - Only in the last month i
e
 October 2017, the transaction figures from UPI reached 7 crores 70 lakhs
 iske ek maheene pehle yani sitambar main sirf 3 crores 90 lakh logon ne UPI ke jariye len dein kiya tha
 One of the major reasons for this was people shopping online during Diwali
 is saal UPI ke jariye ab tak 7057 crores kaa len dein ho chukaa he jo pichley saal ke mukaable 32 fisadi zyada he
 - This is the first time since demonetisation that people are getting used to living with less cash
 notebandi ke samay jitani nagdi logon ke haathon main thi, saal bhar baad bhi uskaa sirf 88 fisadi hi logon ke haathon main he
 - People are now using the card even more
 pichley ek saal main card se hone vaale len dein main 60 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he or panit of cell mashin kii sankhya main 78 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 However there is another aspect of the picture
 digital india kii buland tasviir dikhaane vaale in aankadon ke bich sarkaar ke liye chintaa kii baat ye bhi he ki notebandi ke baad noton kii killat kii vajah se jo log digital tareeke se len dein kar rahe the, unamem se bahut se log phir se cash kii ore laut bhi rahe hai
 Just after the demonetisation and if we look at the figures now, the number of people taking cashless manner also decreased and the value of the transaction too
 - yahi nahin, sarkaar ke tamaam daavon ke peeche ye sachai bhi chhipi hui he ki bharat main log nagdi kaa moh nahin chod par rahe hai
 At present, there are 1,31,81,190 crore cash in the country, due to which transactions are taking place
 digital len dein ke saare tareekon ko jod kar bhi dekha jaae to ye kul len dein ke 5 fisadi se bhi kam he
 That is, 95 percent of the work in India is still going on from cash
 - bharat main 70 crores logon ke paas debit card he or 3 karod logon ke paas credit card he lekin asal main inkaa istemaal karne waalon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 -what is the obstacle in the way of being a cash-less economy of Akhir India? Kiran Vasireddy, Vice President of Paytm, the largest e-wallet company, says that people in India have a habit of cash, people find it most reliable
 is aadat ko badalane main samay lagegaa
 Many experts also believe that the flood of cash lash has suddenly flooded so many ways that people are in awe
 darjanon i-wolet, bhim, upiai, aadhaar pe, net bankig, pachaason tarah ke bainkon ke apane ap logon kaa kaam aasaan karne ke bajaay unki uljhan badhaa rahe hai
 - a large number of people do not have access to the Internet to use cashless methods
 kai ke paas debit card to hai lekin unako istemaal karne ke liye POS mashin nahin he
 Many people do not know how to use it and they consider cash to be the most convenient
 - cashles iconomi main logon ko sabase badi ashanka apane dhan kii suraksha ko lekar he
 Cyber affairs expert Pawan Duggal explains that people are most afraid of the cashless method, that if there is a mess, they will not have any listener
 duggal ke mutabik notebandi ke baad jitani teji se cashlesh len dein kii sankhya badi usase bhi teji se sibar krime badhaa he
 He says it is a big mistake to think of a cashless economy without adequate security and necessary infrastructure
 duggal kehete hai ki ek baar digital lenden main koi gadabad ho jaae to log apana paisa vaapis paane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakate hai lekin unki koi sunne vaala nahin hota
 From e-wallet to Bhima, UPI and helpline of many banks, service is very poor
 - khud bharat sarkaar se bhim ap par logon kii shikayaton kaa nipataara hone main bahut samay lagata he or shikayaton kaa jawaab samay par nahin diya jaataa
 In such a situation, the target of 2500 crore digital transactions in the current financial year seems impossible
 jahaan tak baat notebandi se kaala dhan pakade jane kii baat he to khud bhartiya rigerv bank hi kah chukaa he ki notebandi ke vakt jitna paisa logon ke paas tha wo kareeb-kareeb sara bainkon ke paas waapas aa chukaa he
 The opposition alleges that this means that no black money came out of demonetisation
 vahiin sarkaar kaa tark he ki sirf bank main jamaa kara dene se koi kaala dhan safed nahin ho jaataa or bank main jamaa karaae gaye rupe kii jaanch se kaale dhan kaa pardaafash hoga
 This process is still going on, so it is too early to say clearly about the impact of demonetisation on black money
 haalanki ek phayda saaf dikhataa he ki tex ritern file karne waalon kii sankhya main sidhe 25 fisadi kaa ijapha ho gaya
 After demonetisation, 2 crore 79 lakh people filed income tax returns, which is 56 lakh more than last year

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne narendra modi ke us aarope ko aaj khaarij kar diya ki unhone (mamata ne) vammorcha ke 35 saal ke kaarykaal kii apeksha apane 35 maheene ke shasankaal main rajya ko adhik nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 With this, Mamta said that she does not need to take 'knowledge' from Modi regarding development
 trinmul congress pramukh mamata ne twitor par likhaa he, 'agar vah satta main aate hai, bharat andhkaar main dub jayega
 We do not need knowledge on development from riot architects

 He said that migrants from Bangladesh came to India under the indira-mujib Agreement of 1971
 unhone kaha, 'shri modi ko itihaas nahin maaloom he
 They do not know that speaking Bangla does not make any Bangladeshi
 ' Mamta said, 'elsewhere in India, anyone who speaks Bangla is called Bangladeshi

 He accused Modi of doing divisive politics and said, "mr
 Modi wants to divide Bengalis and non-bengalis

 isse pehle somvaar ko kolkata main hui press conference main bhi tiemasi netaaon ne modi par jamkar hamalaa kiya tha
 He said that by forgetting political decency, Narendra Modi is carrying out personal attacks
 party ne modi ke aarope par kaha ki mamata kii paintings par lagaae aarope ko sabit karen anyathaa manahani kaa saamana karen
 The party says that Modi is arrogant and he is making false allegations

 More and more politicians are not cricketers who run cricket
 kai rajya cricket association ke adhyaksh bhi rajaneta hai
 Should not such a time come that a reserve has to be reserved for politicians in the cricket team too? pichley kuch saalon se jis tarah shivasainik cricket ko raajnneeti se jod rahe hai, yah bhi chintaa kii baat he
 Earlier, Pakistan was preventing the team from playing in Mumbai, now Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar has been threatened not to umpire in the india-south Africa match
 is vajah se isisi ne unhen is match main ampiring se hataa diya he
 The Pakistan Cricket Board and BCCI meeting to be held in Mumbai also had to be canceled due to Shiv Sainiks
 ho saktaa he ki shivasainik yah farmaan bhi jari kar den ki maharashtra kaa koi bhi khilaadi pakistan team ke khilaaf match na khele, phir pakistan or bharat ke bich hone vaale kisi bhi match ko maharashtra ke darshak na dekhen
 Does patriotism mean that we should see cricket through the prism of politics and do politics? Does doing so increase our patriotism? This is not the first time that Shiv Sainiks are doing such an act
 varsh 1991 main shivasainikon kii vajah se bharat or pakistan ke bich mumbai main hone vaala test match radd karnaa padaa tha, 1999 main shivasainikon ne dilli ke firoz shah stadium kii pich ko bhi khod daalaa tha
 No Pakistani player got a place in the IPL due to the opposition of Shiv Sainiks
 aise kai maamle saamne aae hai jinaki vajah se bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket match radd karnaa padaa he
 The cricketing relationship between India and Pakistan is very old
 azaadi ke baad donon deshon ke bich kai match khele gaye hai
 There has always been an attempt to keep cricket away from politics
 donon desh ke bich mumbai main bhi teen test match khele ja chuke hai
 For the first time since independence, the Pakistan team toured India in October 1952 and played five Test matches
 isamen se ek match mumbai main bhi khelaa gaya tha jisamen bharat ko jeet mili thi
 Then in 1955 India toured Pakistan and played five Test matches
 tippaniyan The cycle between the two countries continued till February 1961
 tanaav kii vajah se 1961 se 1977 tak koi bhi test match nahin khelaa ja sakaa tha
 It seemed that perhaps the relationship between the two countries had ended, but with the effort of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 1978, the Indian team toured Pakistan and played three Test matches
 vaajapeyi us vaqt morarji desai kii sarkaar main videsh mantri the
 Then next year Pakistan team visited India and played six test matches
 isamen se ek match mumbai main bhi khelaa gaya tha or bharat ne ise 131 ran se jeeta tha
 Not only this, the cricketing relationship between India and Pakistan had almost ended after the 1999 Kargil War
 phir atal bihari bajpeyi sarkaar kii koshish kii vajah se bhartiya team ne pakistan kii daura kiya or teen test match kii siries 2-1 se jitkar ai
 Will the protest improve Pakistan and stop cross-border terrorism? If that were the case, cross-border terrorism would have stopped by now
 bharat ne apni taraf se harsambhav koshish kii he ki raajnneeti ko cricket se dur rakhaa jaae
 Cricket can bring the two countries closer
 kai baar dekha gaya he ki jab donon desh tanaav kii vajah se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar nahin hote the, tab cricket ko ek hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karke baatcheet ke liye manaaya jaataa tha
 Cricket should not be viewed through the prism of politics but politics

 kya deshbhakti kaa matlab yahi he ki ham cricket ko raajnneeti kii chashme se dekhen or raajnneeti karen? kya aisa karne se hamaari deshbhakti bad jaati he? yah pehali baar nahin he ki shivasainik aisi harakat kar rahe hai
 In 1991, due to Shiv Sainiks, the Test match between India and Pakistan in Mumbai had to be canceled, in 1999 the Shiv Sainiks also dug up the pitch of Firoz Shah Stadium in Delhi
 shivasainikon ke virodh ke vajah se kisi bhi pakistani khilaadi ko ipel main jagah nahin mili
 There have been many cases due to which cricket matches between India and Pakistan have to be canceled

 If a person belongs to a politician, it does not mean that he becomes a criminal
 ' It was also appealed in the petition that the court should cancel the order given by the government to dismiss the investigation of the licenses of companies of Vadra and other builders from 2005 to 2012 in Haryana

 Also, transparency in the system is also a priority of our government
 prandilli or bihar kii jabardast haar ke baad assam kii jeet par kaisaa mahasoos ho rahaa he?uh assam kii hamaari jeet ko mahaj ek party kii chunavi jeet ke rup main nahin dekha janaa chahie
 This is a sign of acceptance of BJP ideology in the Northeast

 Our aim is to register a similar BJP presence from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kutch to Kamrup
 bengal main hamaara vot pratishat ab 15 fisadi he or kerala main hamane khaataa khol diya he
 What is the single biggest factor behind this: A: Modi ji's popularity and public confidence in him
 dilli main 10 saal or assam main 15 saal tak chale congress ke kushasan ke baad logon ne do saal ke dauraan bijepi ke saaf-suthere or vikaas kendrit shashan main ek vikalp ko dekha, jisane baari satta virdohi maahaul khadaa kar diya
 How important was Ram Madhav's role in Prasam ?: He played an important role in formulating and implementing the strategy
 prayaap kah rahe hai ki kashmir se kanyakumari or kuccha se kamrup tak ab bijepi kii maujuudagi ho gai he
 What do you think about the hurdles in states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha? UP: UP is not a barrier for us at all, but a golden opportunity for BJP to get a clear majority there
 ham is baat ko prachaarit karenge ki samaajawaadee party kii gundgardee or sapa tathaa bispi donon ke bhrashtachar ke saath-saath tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke chalate rajya main logon kii jindagi kisi badahaal ho chuki he
 People will get the answer in favor of BJP on these three issues
 prahpunjab main shiromani akali dal ke saath aapke gathbandhan ke khilaaf janata main jabardast maahaul he
 It is being said that BJP can break ties with the Akali Dal
 uh bijepi or akali dal achche or bure dinon ke sahyogi hai
 The Akali Dal is our old friend, so there is no question (of being separated from it)
 lekin haa, punjab sarkaar ke khilaaf ek dushprachaar ke chalate logon ke dimag main nakaaratmak dharna pravesh kar gai he
 We will contest the elections for the good work done in the infrastructure sector of Parkash Singh Badal's government and the way his government has stood with the farmers in bad times is a reason for our confidence

 uh main sahamat nahin hum
 We played an honest opposition
 hamane bajet ke khilaaf vot kiya or congress ke nau vidhayakon ne bhi yahi kiya
 When the Uttarakhand government was trying to buy these nine mlas, we worked to protect them from the threat of the government
 isamen kuch bhi aniatik nahin tha
 In contrast, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand was caught offering money to his party's mlas in a video
 prahaj aap bijepi or aresas ke rishte ko kaise dekhte hai, kyonki sangh party ke siyaasi masalon main ab zyada se zyada dakhal dene laga he

 A: i feel sad that Bharat Mata Ki Jai is being taken in communal contexts
 maine bharat mata kii jai par apane vichaaron se media ko bahut saaf tareeke se avgat kara diya he
 This has no contradiction with our development agenda
 donon ek saath rah sakate hai
 Since many people believe that the BJP cannot get rid of the issue of intolerance 
 aap sakshi maharaj, sadhvi niranjan jyoti or giriraaj singh ke alpsankhyakon se jude nafrat bhare bayanon ko dekhie
 A: It depends on what you call intolerance
 bihar chunaav ke baad ashishnutaa kaa yah abhiyaan thanda kyon pad gaya? isliye kyonki yah hamaare khilaaf rajnatik dushprachaar kii ranneeti kaa hissaa tha
 As far as some of our people are concerned, i believe that such things have happened during the tenure of previous governments
 maine kai baar spasht kiya he ki hamaare kuch logon ke bayaan party kaa paksh nahin hai
 The bjd's allies believe that they are being taken lightly these days

 We will try to improve it further

 Having a bank account was a poor man's dream
 jan dhan yojana ne isi ko mahasoos karte hue 21 karod garib pariwaron ke khate khole hai
 By 2019, 60 million poor families who cook on wood or coal or kerosene oil stove and as a result suffer from lung related diseases will get LPG connections
 aazaadee ke 70 saal baad bhi 18,000 gaanvon main bijli nahin thi, jab ham satta main aae
 Today, electricity has been delivered to 9,000 of them and almost all villages will be covered by 2018
 modi sarkaar ne rojgaar kii paribhaasha ko hi badal daalaa he
 Earlier it used to mean job
 aaj start-ap india, stand-ap india or mudra jaisi yojanaon ke madhyam se 3
 More than 49 crore people have got employment and we have opened new avenues of self-employment
 prahor videsh niti main?uh pehali baar hamaari samskruti or vyapaar ko videsh niti main ahm jagah mili he

 Lalu Yadav, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief of Bihar's largest party, is visiting flood-hit areas in the state, notably Raghopur, from where his son and political successor Tejashwi won the elections last year
 lalu ke aalochakon kaa aarope he ki unhen apane bete ke liye aage aana padaa he
 Because Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi is in Europe, he first went for a government visit and then is holidaying while the state is in crisis
 aalochak yah bhi kehete hai ki do anya baadh prabhavit vidhansabha kshetron, danapur or maner par lalu kaa vishesh dhyaan he, kyonki ye donon patliputra sansadeey kshetra ke antargat aate hai jahaan se do saal pehle bijepi ke ramakripal yadav saansad chune gaye hai or ab wo centre main mantri hai
 Ramkripal Yadav was once a trusted aide of Lalu Yadav
 lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main jab rajd ne lalu kii beti misa bharti kaa naam patliputra sansadeey seat se ummidavaar banaaya tab ramkripal ne party se naata tod liya
 Lalu Yadav had recently announced that Misa Bharti would contest the next Lok Sabha election in the next Lok Sabha election too, despite losing badly in the last election to Ramkripal Yadav, ignoring that she is a Rajya Sabha MP

 tejasvi yadav ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki unhen lagaataar halaat kii jaankaree di jaati rahi he or shuukravaar ko jab wo lautenge to apane kshetra kaa saghan daura karenge
 Lalu's critics allege that he has to come forward for his son
 kyonki bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi europe main hai, pehle to sarkari daure ke liye gaye the or phir chhuttiyaan manaa rahe he, jabaki rajya sankat main he
 Critics also say that Lalu has special focus on two other flood-affected assembly constituencies, Danapur and Maner, as both of them fall under the Pataliputra parliamentary constituency from where Ramakripal Yadav of BJP has been elected two years ago and now the center Is a minister in ramkripal yadav kabhi lalu yadav ke vishwaasapaatr sahyogi the
 But in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when RJD nominated Lalu's daughter Misa Bharti from Pataliputra parliamentary seat, Ramkripal broke away from the party

 The comments lalu yadav ko apane bade bete or mantri tej pratap ke liye aisa nahin karnaa padaa kyonki vah khud apane vidhansabha kshetra mahua main maujuud hai or sarkari aspataalon or anya sthanon kaa daura kar rahe hai or baadh prabhaviton ko raahat sunishchat kar rahe hai
 Sources close to Tejashwi Yadav say that he has been constantly informed about the situation and when he returns on Friday, he will visit his area intensively

 ' america main vishwa hindu congress mensanghapramukhmohan bhagwatke sher or kute vaale bayaan par bavaal much gaya he
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar have strongly objected to Bhagwat's statement
 ovaisi or ambedkar ne aarope lagaaya he ki bhagwat ke is bayaan main sher kaa aashay sangh or kute kaa vipakshi partiyon se he
 Owaisi said that the Constitution of India described everyone as a human being
 isamen kisi ko bhi sher yaa kute ke rup main nahin kaha gaya he
 This is the problem with the Sangh
 sangh bharat ke samvidhan ko nahin maanata
 Such is the ideology of the Sangh
 isamen ve khud ko sher or baaki sabhi ko kutta samajhate hai
 They think of themselves as powerful and others as weak
 lekin hamaare samvidhan main sabhi ko baraabar samajha gaya he
 For 90 years, Sangh, speaking the same language, said that he is not astonished by this statement of Bhagwat
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kaha ki aresas pichley 90 saal se isi bhashaa kaa istemaal karti aa rahi he
 The people of the country will answer them
 bhagwat ne kya kaha tha
 
 
 Bhagwat said in his address on Friday that Hindus have no desire for dominance and the community will prosper only when it functions as a society
 unhone kaha tha ki ‘agar ek sher akelaa he to junglee kute akraman karke sher ko khatm kar sakate hai
 We should not forget this
 ’ bhagwat ne kaha ki ham duniya ko behatar bananaa chaahate hai
 We have no desire for dominance
 hamaara prabhaav vijay athwa aupniveshikaran kaa parinaam nahin he
 Prakash Ambedkar did not condemn Bhariwat Bahujan Federation leader Prakash Ambedkar also condemned Bhagwat's statement at the World Hindu Congress held in Chicago, USA
 ambedkar ne shanivaar ko samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main bhagwat ke is bayaan kii ninda kii or daawa kiya ki ‘kute’ kaa sandarbh desh kii vipakshi partiyon ke liye he
 He said that i condemn this mentality of Mohan Bhagwat in which he has mentioned opposition parties of the country as a dog
 unhone kaha ki partiyaan satta main ain or gayi lekin yah maansikta sattapaksh kii yah soch dikhaati he ki vipaksh unase lard nahin saktaa
 Ambedkar said that i believe people should think again before bringing them back to power
 unhone nai dilli main rashtriya padaadhikariyon or rajya ikai ke adhyakshon kii baithak main ‘ajey bhaajapa’ ne unke naare par bhi tanj kiya
 He said that BJP had almost lost in Gujarat and lost in Karnataka

 nae logon ko recruit karne ke liye kai choti-badi companiyaan campus placement ke liye aati hai
 This is the reason when taking admission in the college, students choose the college with good placement record
 campus placement ke liye taiyaari karne kaa matlab kisi exam ke liye taiyaari karnaa bilkul nahin he
 To get a good job, students should have confidence that they have the ability to get a job
 iske liye usko pehle se hi kuch taiyaari kerani hogi or saath company ke hiring nazariye ko dhyaan main rakhte kuch baton kaa gaur bhi karnaa hoga
 With the help of these tips, you can not only get a good job in campus placements but can also leave a good impression on the hiring company
 (1) larning capacity:jab bhi koi company kisi fressure ko hair karti he to sabase pehle kisi student main yah dekhati he ki usamen nae kaam ko seekhney kii kitni lalak he or kitni jaldi wo us kaam ko sikh jaataa he
 For this, every company has its own fund which the company examines during the interview in the candidate to see how useful it is for them
 isliye is baat ke liye aap achche se taiyaar hokar jaaen ki company aapaki larning campacity check karegi
 (2) Attitude: During the campus placement interview, the students also select the attest of the selected student
 darasal company chaahati he ki vah positive approach vaale candidet ko hair kare
 Therefore, the company tries to somehow see how you react during the offer amount or any difficulty during the question
 agar aap shant hokar positive hokar jawaab dete hai to aapaki job pakki he
 (3) The company wants innovative candidates: During the interview, any company sees which candidates can benefit them the most
 iske liye company candidet main innovative skills kii bhi parakh karti he
 So during the interview, you also have to show how innovative you are and how they can prove beneficial for the company
 (4) company kii jarurat:darasal har post ke liye company kii apni jarurat hoti he or company usee ke hisaab se hiring karti he
 So during the interview she asks you questions related to the need of the post
 isaki taiyaari ke liye behatar hoga ki aap college kii placement cell se hapale hi pataa kar len ki company kis post ke liye recruitment karne aa rahi he
 You should prepare accordingly
 (5) selleri negociation se bachein:acchhee naukari or achche package kii chahat sabhi students ko hoti he
 Most of the company's salary is fixed
 kai baar selleri negociation karnaa aapaki banati baat ko bigaad bhi saktaa he
 For this, you also need to understand the conditions of the industry

 There has been a political uproar over the statement made by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor about Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 tharur ke bayaan par ab kendriya mantriprakash jaavdekarne palatwaar kiya he
 He said that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi also called the opposition in 1984
 jaavdekar ne shanivaar ko tharur dwaara die gaye us tathaa-kathith bayaan kii aalochana kii jisamen tharur ne daawa kiya tha ki aresas ke ek sutara ne kisi patrkaar se kaha, ‘‘pradhanmantri narendra modi shiv ling par baithe us bichchhu kii tarah hai jinhen na to haath se hataaya ja saktaa he or na hi chappal se maaraa ja saktaa he
 On this, Javadekar said that "congress is speculating how to compete with Modi at the political level, so she has come down on insult
" rahul baba roj-roj apmaan karte hai, log vahi karenge jo unhen aata he
 Shashi Tharoor is a bit civilized but he too has come to a scorpion comment
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘1984 main congress kaa vigyaapan tha, rajeev gandhi 1984 ke chunaavon main vipaksh ko bichchhu kehane vaala vigyaapan lekar aae the
 This reflects the mentality of the Congress

 In the exit poll which appeared before the results on May 23, the Bharatiya Janata Party seems to get a strong majority
 yani narendra modi ek baar phir pradhanmantri ban sakate hai wo bhi badi takat ke saath
 With these exit polls, discussions have started in political circles that if the results of the exit poll prove to be true, then the power of the Modi government at the Center can increase even more
 agar modi sarkaar centre main ek badi takat ke saath vaapasi karti he to bhartiya janata party ko apane un kaamon ko puraa karne kaa mauka milegaa, jo kaaphi lambey samay se unke agenda main the
 Be it the matter of construction of Ram temple or the election of one country, there are many issues which are included in the 'work to Do' list of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 
 
 
 So on which issues can BJP decide with great force ram mandir ke liye jameen adhigrahayodhya main vivaadit janmabhumi par ram mandir nirmaan ke liye 1990 se hi andolan jari he
 Every time BJP talks about building a temple as per the constitution, pressure has been put on them by their supporters
 ab agar centre main bijepi ek badi takat ke saath aati he to bataur centre sarkaar adhyadesh laakar vivaadit bhoomi ke aasapaas kii jameen ko adhigrahit karne kaa bada faisla liya ja saktaa he yaa isaki ore koi bada kadam uthaaya ja saktaa he

 dhara 370 par faislajammu-kashmir main dhara 370 ke mudde par bhartiya janata party aakraamak rahi he
 Every time she has been talking about removing it, Amit Shah has also raised the issue throughout the campaign
 ab agar bijepi ke haath main prachand bahumat vaali satta ho or is mudde par kadam badaye jate hai to hairaani vaali baat nahin hogi
 JK gets the right to a special state under Section 370, under which no person from the valley can buy land
 3
 Article 35A can be removed! Like Article 370, Article 35A is also a big issue related to Jammu and Kashmir, on which the war on the cross has been going on
 anuchhed 35A bhi dhara 370 kaa hi ek hissaa hi he, jo kashmir ko vishesh adhikaar detaa he
 The regional parties there have been demonstrating against the removal of the PDP-NC
 isko lekar abhi supreme court main bhi ek maamla chal rahaa he

 He has also been talking to the states about this, but the talk could not be made
 ab agar jab purnat: rup se satta bijepi ke haath main hogi, to narendra modi kaa ye agenda puraa ho saktaa he

 teen talaak bill par faisla sambhavamuslim mahilaon ko haq dilaane kii baat kar bijepi ne sansad main teen talaak bill pesh kiya
 In which it is said to take action against Muslim men who give three wives to their wives
 bijepi is bill ko loksabhaa-rajyasabha main laa chuki he lekin vipaksh ne har baar adnga lagaaya he
 6
 NRC ke mudde par bijepi ko mili takatpurvottar main NRC kaa mudda is baar ke chunaav main chaaya rahaa he
 Despite the opposition in assam-arunachal, the BJP went ahead on this issue because it is an attacker on the opposition
 bijepi ne NRC ko puure desh main lagu karne kaa vaada kiya he, aise main agsit pole ke nattejey agar sach sabit hue to nai centre sarkaar ise hakeekat main tabdeel kar sakati he
 7
 samaan naagarik kanoonhar naagarik ke liye ek hi kanoon kaa mudda bijepi kaaphi samay se uthaati rahi he
 That is, only the law of the Constitution will replace any religious law
 iske tahat har parivaar main do bachche, shaadi, sampatti ke adhikaar niyamit kiye ja sakate hai
 If the results of the exit poll prove to be correct, then the Bharatiya Janata Party can take steps in this direction
 8
 Savarna may increase on reservation: The Modi government in its first term gave 10% reservation on economic basis to the upper castes
 agar phir ek baar modi sarkaar prachand bahumat ke saath satta main aati he to sarkaar is daayre ko badhaane kii ore kadam uthaa sakati he
 Reservation on economic grounds has been on the agenda of BJP and RSS for a long time
 9
 On the basis of 282 seats in Pakistan or terrorism, the Bharatiya Janata Party government took a tough stand against Pakistan
 phir chaahe sargical strike ho yaa phir airstrike ho
 According to the exit poll, if the BJP comes to power again, it may be preferred to take tough decisions against Pakistan

 After a dispute over celebrating 'nabi Divas' at a school in Howrah, there was tension in the area a few days ago, now the West Bengal government has made it mandatory to celebrate 'nabi Divas' in government libraries across the state
 diarectoret of librari services kii ore se jari aadesh main rajya kii 2000 se zyada librariyon ko saal bhar main kiye jane vaale kaaryakramon ke hisse ke taur par nabi diwas manaane ke liye bhi kaha gaya he
 The Government has mentioned 51 programs in Order Memo No
 74 / 1 (43) / LS OM / Lib-31 / 1992 dated 11 January 2017
 inamen hazrat mohammad ke janmdin par rajya sanchalit librariyon main fatiha dawaaj dahum (yaa id ud milad un nabi) ko bhi manaane ke liye kaha gaya he
 It will be celebrated on 2 December this year
 rajya librari vibhaag kii ore se saal main manaae jane prayek kaarykram ke liye har librari ko 1000-1000 rupye kaa anudaan milegaa
 It has been made clear in the order that in addition to this grant the library can take help of local resources at its level for organizing the program
 bataa den ki is saal janvari main haavda ke tehatta main sthit sarkari sahaayta praapt skool ko sampradayik tanaav ke baad anischitkaaleen ke liye band karnaa padaa tha
 Such a situation came after a section of students in the school campus demanded permission to celebrate Nabi Day
 skool prabandhan ne is tarah kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The school management, in a letter to the police, alleged that some students, influenced by outside 'islamic fundamentalists', tried to celebrate Nabi Day in the school premises despite not being allowed on 13 December last year
 ise bhi padhein:bengal:tanaav ke baad sarkari skool band, 2000 chaatro kaa bhavishya adhar menindia today se baatcheet main skool ke principal ne kaha tha ki jo log nabi diwas manaane kii anumati dene kii maang kar rahe the, unhone ye sawaal uthaaya tha ki skool prabandhan har saal skool parisar main saraswati puja ke aayojan kii anumati kyon detaa he
 As far as the state government notification for the public holidays for 2017 in Bengal is concerned, Saraswati Puja has been declared an official holiday
 lekin nabi diwas isamen shaamil nahin he
 Right-wing organizations, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, have criticized the state government's decision
 inkaa kahana he ki rajya kii librariyon main nabi diwas manaae jane kaa pehle koi udhaaharan nahin miltaa, isliye alpsankhyak tushtikaran kii disha main uthaaya gaya ek or kadam he
 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, 'bengal is on its way to becoming the next Bangladesh
 isliye nabi diwas or iftaar partiyon kaa aayojan to hoga lekin is baat ke asaar hai ki durga puja or saraswati puja ke aayojan band ho jaaen
 This is our big concern
 ye isi khuli tushtikaran raajnneeti kaa hi nateeja he ki bengal main sampradayik tanaav bad rahaa he
 However, West Bengal's Minister of Public Education and Library Services, Siddikullah Chaudhary, dismisses such criticisms as absurd
 siddikullah kehete hai, agar nabi diwas manaaya jaataa he to kya dikkat he? siddikullah ke mutabik vibhaag ne rabindranath tagore or subhash chandra bose ke janmdiwason samet aise kai dinon par kaarykram yojit karne ke nirdesh die hai
 The 51 programs mentioned in the government order include cultural events on the occasion of Saraswati Puja
 inke alaava christmas, good friday, buddha poornima, gurunanak dev kaa janmdin, raksha bandhan, id ul fitar, id ul juha ke saath swatantraaa diwas or ganatantr diwas par bhi rajya librariyon main sarkari aadesh ke mutabik kaarykram yojit honge

 jodhpur main jaj madhusudan sharma ne jab 2 bajkar 30 minute par asaram ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai to asaram rone laga
 Along with this, the accused in this case, Shilpi and Sharatchandra, were heard for twenty years
 isse pehle jab court ne asaram ko yon shoshan maamle main doshi qaraar diya tha to uskaa cheharaa utar gaya tha
 After a few minutes, Asaram Ram started chanting silently and then suddenly he started laughing in a dramatic manner
 iske baad usne jaj se raham kii guhaar bhi lagaai thi
 Then Asaram put his hands on the lawyers' shoulder and said - Say something
 iske baad jab jaj ne asaram ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai to vah adaalat main hi ro padaa
 Asaram Bapu was convicted by a Jodhpur court in a 5-year-old sexual abuse case
 suraksha kaarnon se jail main hi court lagaai gai
 Judge Madhusudan was hearing the case
 vah subah tay vakt par adaalat pahunche or aropiyon ko talab kiya
 After all the accused arrived, the judge summoned Asaram
 wo vahaan nahin tha
 The court proceedings had started, so Judge Madhusudan Sharma asked to bring Asaram and was told that he was worshiping
 phir vah 15 minute baad jaj ke saamne pahunchaa
 Asaram's lawyer then told the judge that he wanted to say something in front of him
 is par jaj sharma ne vakil ko kaha ki ab kuch nahin sunanaa he
 The case hearing has been completed
 ab nirnay kaa samay he
 After this, Judge Sharma typed about two pages from his stano
 kuch der baad unhone faisla sunaate hue asaram ko doshi qaraar de diya
 Shilpi and Sharatchand along with Asaram were also convicted by the judge
 lekin shiva or prakaash kii kam umr kaa hawala dete hue jaj ne unhen bari kar diya
 Asaram's face came off as soon as he heard the verdict
 vah kaaphi maayoos dikh rahaa tha
 He started chanting the name of Ram
 or kuch der baad vah hansane laga
 Meanwhile, the court started further action
 sarkari vakilone asaram ko kadi sajaa die jane ko lekar daleelein dena shuru kiya or sajaa par bahes hone lagi
 Meanwhile, after hearing the verdict, Asaram told the judge that he had become old
 us par raham kiya jaae
 But the judge did not react to his words

 There were 14 lawyers present in the court to defend him

 The second Rajasthani prostitute is Bhojpuri speaking
 wo rajasthani kyon nahin bol rahi? kahin uskaa taalluk bihar yaa upi se to nahin
 This is too much, assuming that there is more migration in Bihar and UP, but it is unforgivable to show

 This does not mean that this is our identity
 matlab kuch bhi
 It makes sense to show everyone screaming in front of a beautiful anchor in the studio

 ab ek murti vaala kamaane ke liye apni murtiyon nahin bechega to or kya karegaa, par PK main us shaks ko shaatir dukandaar dikhaa diya
 PK will not have children, but the idol has one

 doodh
 
 
 Milk
 
 
 pi sakate hai roj glass phul
 However, many are unable to meet
 par bhagwaan ke naam par kanjusee kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Because the matter is to make them happy
 apni ichchhaaon kii purti kaa he
 Now PK calls it hypocrisy
 agar log doodh chadhaanaa band kar den, to bhagwaan to naaraaz honge na
 What will happen to the earnings of the milkmen? If the poor do not earn, how will they live? 7
 murti banane vaale kumhaaron or kaarigaron kokala ishwar kii dein he
 No training can be taken for this
 bhagwaan kaa ek tathastu aapako maa kii pet main kalakaar bana detaa he
 The idol of God is also a testament to the artistic wisdom of the potter and the artisan
 PK is kala kaa apmaan karata he, sawaal poochta he ki bhagwaan kii murti tumne banaai
 That too with these hands
 kumhaar or karigar bhagwaan kii is khubasurat dein kaa istemaal nahin karenge to or koun banayega murtiyon

 Always ready to serve you
 iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki pratibandhit kshetra main koi peshaab kare to pulisavaale bhi usapar najar rakhen
 If sighted, then you will do the work of scolding, is arrest necessary? Delhi Police is not in such free time, they catch big gangsters and rapists

 PK wants Hindu society to discuss bigotry, which is good
 par sawaal yah he ki sirf hindu dharm or uski manyataon par hi kyon? lagbhag teen ghante kii film thi, har dharm ke liye baraabar-baraabar time baant lete
 It is permissible for the followers of Hinduism to be angry
 10
 The religious leaders who do not have the right to wear clothes, they will tell about faith
 pehle hi court ke kaaran baabaaon ke durdin aae hue hai
 Now PK too fell behind
 koi jaati dushmani he kya? kahata he ki agar dharmaguru chamatkaar kar sakate hai wo desh kii garib janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch karen
 So what will the government do? The religious leaders have taken the contract for everything in the country
 pehle se hi gyaan baant rahe hai, ye kam he kya?11
 Human community gave zero to the world
 gods partical kii pariklpana hamanen kii
 But what did PK learn from us
 
 
 chori karnaa or jhooth bolnaa
 Is there anything more insulting than this? We deliberately selected 11 types of people for this list because according to Hinduism this number is auspicious
 aawaaj aisi ho jo dur talak sunai de, isliye shuruyaat shubh honi chahie

 ) Former Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely has left the Congress and joined the BJP
 emsidi chunaav se thik pehle congress ko bada jhatka laga he
 After joining BJP, Lovely said that he questioned the party leadership
 arvinder singh lavali ne kaha ki congress ab pehle jaisi nahin rahi
 If the party leadership does not even talk to the leaders, then what will happen to the people? walia sahab or mangat ram singhl se bhi baat nahin kii
 The manifesto was suddenly detected and i was not even called
 lavali ne party main apni andekhi kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that where there is no self-respect, how can we live there
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki, '1984 ke baad koi sikh party se nahin judata tha
 My life was in danger, yet remained in the party, added the Sikhs
 main aise samay main adhyaksh bana jab jimmedaari lene ko koi taiyaar nahin tha
 But the party did not take any lessons
 netaa kah rahe hai ki tikat bik rahe hai lekin koi sunne vaala bhi nahin he
 Lovely said that i sacrificed my seat in 2015
 use adhyaksh banaaya jaski jamaanat bhi nahin bachi
 i was the only president in the entire country who was removed without any reason
 maine koi aitraaj nahin kiya, do saal tak shant rahaa
 'congress is Dead' Arvinder Singh Lovely said that the Congress party is over
 lavali ne rahul gandhi kii kushalta par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is not able to run the party
 lavali ne apana dard bayaan karte hue kaha ki meraa kasoor bas itnaa he ki main jameen kii raajnneeti karata hum
 What should i do if these people feel threatened? shila dikshit par bhadkeervinder lavali ne purv siem shila dikshit par bhi tippanee kii
 Lovely said that she is calling him a traitor in connection with setting the score with Ajay Maken
 'shila ji ko vafadari mubarak ho
 Agreed or disagreed but i did not lose any respect in Sheela ji
 maine bure samay main sabko sammaan diya, jab shapath liya to shila ji ko apni gaadi main lekar aayaa
 If i am not, why are i afraid? 'raaj babbar ko bataaya bojhalwali ne kaha, 'is chunaav main dilli ke log bataaenge ki jinhen paise lekar tikat diya gaya wo kaise jeetenge
 i am not a manipulator, was with Raj Babbar in the election campaign till last night
 jo mujhe gaddaar kah rahe hai wo khud boj hai
 Not worth any work
 ' As usual, there was a lot of traffic on that road in Delhi
 din kaa vakt tha
 The pedestrians also had a significant number
 tabhi bich sadak par chalati trephic ke bich achaanak kuch ladke ek car se utarate hai or ek duusari car ko roak dete hai
 Along with that car, the other vehicles coming from behind also stop
 sadak kinare ek pisiar vine bhi khadi thi
 But both of the boys, who got off the car, suddenly pulled out the pistol and started firing
 bich sadak golibari dekh kar pehali nazar main yakeen karnaa mushkil he
 Viewers may also be tricked into being part of any of their film scenes
 lekin koi sachmuch main bich sadak par saikadon kii ankhon ke saamne, kaayade-kaanoon or police se bemauf kisi par yun goliyaan barasaaye, to ye sab kuch dekhnaa naa sirf daraavna he balki ajeeb bhi he
 Then an urban man with trembling hands tried to shoot this scene on his mobile phone, so that when these pictures come out tomorrow, there is no scope for anyone to doubt this incident
 magar sachai to ye he ki dilli ke gangvaar main jo bhi ho jaae, wo kam he
 In this incident, even though the two gangsters thirsting for each other's blood are colliding with each other, the date witnesses that Delhi's gangsters often go so far in hostility that they along with their enemies as well as their innocent family members and Even relatives do not miss to target bullets
 19 may, 2019 dopaher 3
 At 45 pm, two gangsters caught up in their fight for their supremacy over the dark world of crime in Dwarka, Delhi, in fact, suddenly confronted each other on Sunday
 vikaas dalal naam ke ek gangster ko khabar mili thi ki uskaa dushman praveen gahalot apane logon ke saath dwarka ilaake kii is sadak se guzarane vaala he
 Just! Then what? Vikas started waiting for Praveen on the middle road with his henchmen
 taaki ghaat lagaakar use maaraa ja sake
 And then as soon as Praveen reached there with his white colored Ritz car, getting out of his car, Vikas Dalal and his operatives started firing on Praveen
 lekin is kahani main tab ek jabardast twist aa gaya, jab dusron kii jaan lene par amada vikaas dalal khud hi goli kaa shikaar ban gaya
 And watch the game that this bullet was not fired by his enemy Praveen or his operatives to save his life, but by the policemen who are responsible for safeguarding the law in Delhi
 yani yahaan ek hi vakt par gangvaar bhi ho rahaa tha or encounter bhi
 In fact, when the policemen present in a PCR van parked here heard the sound of firing on the middle road and saw some people firing at others, the constable Naresh fired at the attackers with his pistol
 uskaa nishaanaa achook tha
 The bullet hit the Vikas broker directly and Vikas, trying to kill Praveen, got himself killed on the road
 haalanki police kii karrwai ke baavjood vikaas ke gurgon ne praveen par firing jari rakhi or akhirkaar use maar kar hi dam liya
 Watch carefully how after the people of Vikas got assuaged for his death after firing bullets on Praveen Gehlot, he took care of his gangster Vikas Dalal who was lying on the road with the police bullet and tried to take him away
 lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 There was a gang war and an encounter within a few minutes on the occasion
 jisamen do gangster maare gaye
 Praveen Gehlot and Vikas Dalal too
 ab aaie, aapako in donon gangster kii asaliyat se bhi vaakif kara dete hai
 In fact, Vikas Dalal was the henchman of Delhi's infamous gangster Manjit Mahal, who was responsible for all his upside-down business outside the jail at the jails of Manjit, while Praveen Gehlot was a different player in the world of crime
 jabaran vasuuli se lekar zamin hadapney, kisi kii property par kabza karne se lekar use khaali karaane jaise tamaam kaam in gangstaron kii kamai ke tareekon main shaamil tha
 But every day, these two gangsters would follow each other on the road between each other, adopting new tricks of black money, nobody knew
 gandhivadi kaaryakarta anna hazaare or unke samarthakon ne dilli police ke anumati dene se inkaar karne ke baad buudhvaar ko mahatma gandhi ke samadhi sthal raaj ghat par anshan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 a senior police officer said that permission to go on hunger strike at Jantar Mantar has been refused
 iske liye ramlila maidan par baba ramdev ke khilaaf police karrwai hone ke baad ravivaar ko vahaan lagu kii gayi nishedhagna kaa hawala diya gaya he
 Sources said that Delhi Police has already informed Hazare and his associates about not being allowed
 police ne videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko waapas laane ke mudde par anshan kar rahe ramdev or unke samarthakon par ramlila maidan par karrwai karne ke baad jantar mantar or nayi dilli jile ke anya kshetron main 15 din ke liye dhara 144 lagu kar di he
 However, now Hazare's partner and RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal said that Anna Hazare's fast will now be at Rajghat
 hazaare ne beete ravivaar ghoshnaa kii di thi ki vah ramdev par hui karrwai ke virodh main8 june ko jantar mantar par ek din kaa anshan karenge
 He has got his demand for formation of Lokpal Bill drafting committee by fasting for 5 days at Jantar Mantar in April
 hazaare paksh kii ore se somvaar raat purv vidhi mantri shanti bhushan ne dilli police ayukta ko likhe patr main kaha, ‘shantipurna or nihathe tareeke se ikattha hona samvidhan ke anuchhed 19 (1) (ba) ke tahat pradutt mul adhikaar he
 We are going to fast on 8 June which will be peaceful and because of this there will be no threat to the sovereignty, integrity and public order of the country
 ’unhone aagaah karte hue kaha, ‘logon ko jantar mantar par pahunchane se rokane kii kisi bhi koshish ko janata ke mul loktantric adhikaron ke hanan ke taur par dekha jaayegaa
 We hope that the Delhi Police will not try like this
 ’ dilachasp rup se, bhushan ke likhe patr ke lahaze se sanket milte hai ki hazaare paksh ne dilli police se anumati nahin maangi, balki use mahaj prastaavit anshan ke bare main suchit kiya
 Earlier today too, Kejriwal said that the government will have to tell what problem of law and order is likely to arise due to Hazare's fast
 unhone kaha, ‘hazaare 73 varsh ke hai
 He never provoked anyone nor did provocative speeches
 unka kabhi hinsak ateet nahin rahaa
 What is the need of section 144 when he is saying that he wants to gather peacefully
 agar police hamen rokane kii koshish karegi to ham pratirodh nahin karenge or mahaj giraftaar de denge
 Kejriwal alleged that the government had arbitrarily imposed Section 144
 unhone kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay kaa ek aadesh he jo kahata he ki dhara 144 kaa is tareeke se durupyog nahin hona chaiye
