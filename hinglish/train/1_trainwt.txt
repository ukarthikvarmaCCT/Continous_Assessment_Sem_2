 After the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha, the name of the Lok Sabha Speaker is almost fixed and BJP MP Om Birla will be the new speaker
 sadan main endie ke paas 350 se zyada saansadon ko samarthan hai aise main vipaksh apana ummidavaar utarkar haar kii kirakiri se bachanaa chahta he
 This is the reason that according to information received from sources, the opposition will not field any candidate for the post of speaker
 loksabhaa main bijepi ke baad congress sabase bada dal he jiske 52 saansad hai
 In such a situation, even if other opposition parties join hands, it is not a matter of opposition's strength to defeat the NDA candidate
 congress party ke paas 2014 kii tarah is baar bhi netaa vipaksh pad tak ke liye jaruri sankhya bal nahin he
 It has been 2 days since the beginning of the House and the Congress has not even elected its party leader in the House

 In such a situation, after this number of candidates, BJP candidate Om Birla can get the votes of more than 400 mps and his election is going to be decided unopposed
 om birla ko adhyaksh banane kaa faisla chaunkaane vaala jarur he
 In this list, from senior MP Maneka Gandhi to Radha Mohan Singh, Ramapati Ram Tripathi, SS Ahluwalia and Protem Speaker, Dr
 virendra kumaar jaise diggaj netaaon ke naam shaamil the
 But now the seal of the name of Om Birla has cut the cards of other leaders
 menka gandhi ne to mantri na banaae jane ke sawaal par khud kaha tha ki vah varisht saansad hai or unhen spikar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Who is Om Birla, a second time MP from Kota of Birlarajasthan is considered close to Amit Shah
 saath hi vah saansad banane se pehle 3 baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 He was given the responsibility of the organization during the Rajasthan assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main om birla ne kareeb paune teen lakh voton ke antar se congress pratyaashee ko karaari shikast di thi
 He was sworn in as an MP from Om Birla in the House after which all senior leaders including Defense Minister Rajnath Singh were seen congratulating him
 peeche se anya sattadhari saansadon ne birla ke samarthan main narebaaji kii
 How is the Speaker's election Any member of the Lok Sabha can contest the election of the Speaker or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 iske liye chunaav ladane vaale sadsy ko ek prastaavak or ek prastaav ko samarthan karne vaale sadsy kii jarurat hoti he
 This motion is then placed before the House for consideration and voting
 iske baad jis bhi sadsy ke samarthan main sabase zyada saansad hote hai use raashtrapati loksabhaa spikar pad kii shapath dilaate hai
 The NDA has more than 350 mps in the current Lok Sabha, so it is considered certain to be the speaker of the nominated member from the ruling coalition
 bijepi saansad om birla ke naam prastaav shivasena saansad arvind saavant rakhenge jise vinayak raaoot samarthan denge

 Maharashtra Home Minister r Patil has admitted that he has faced problems due to poor knowledge of Hindi
 patil ko 26 november ko mumbai par hue hamale ke dauraan uski tivrata ko kam karne vaala bayaan dene ke liye kadi aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He said, i faced a problem due to weak Hindi
 ab main hindi, angreji or urdu kaa tution le rahaa hum
 Patil said this after laying the foundation stone of the Ideal English School run by the Ideal Education Society in his hometown Tasgaon
 patil ne kaha, mere jaise log marathi madhyam ke skool main padhe hai
 But now the world is changing
 hamaare bacchon ko duusari bhashaaen bhi seekhni chahie
 Every person should be proud of their mother tongue but it is not enough
 gramin kshetron ke logon ko angreji se bhi bhaleebhanti parichit hona chahie
 He said, due to lack of communication skills, other people like me should not face any problem
 patil se saal 2008 main samvaadadaata sammelan main yah poocha gaya tha ki kya mumbai par hua aatankwaadi hamalaa khufia tantra kii vifaltaa he to unhone hindi main kaha tha, aisa nahin he
 a small accident happens in such a big city
 abhi kuch din pehle khabar ai thi ki donon (BSNL or MTNL) ko phir se pataki par laane ke liye 74000 karod ke package ko sarkaar ne kaarij kar diya he

 financial express ke kiran rathi ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar kii he
 Some people will be adjusted elsewhere and the rest will be given voluntary retirement
 sarkaar ke paas in do companiyon ko bachaane ke paise bhi nahin he
 After the decision on Kashmir, she can easily take the risk of closure
 jaise kashmir par ye log chup rahe vaise hi in paune do lakh logon ke maamle main baaki chup rahenge
 There is no benefit in talking about which company was given benefits by not giving 4G to both companies
 unhen har baat par hi laabh diya jaataa he or log ise sahajata se lete hai
 Ignore ab aap problem main aae hai to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki chup rahane vaale log bol uthenge
 Disaster is going to come in the lives of these 1
75 million people
 ye log pareshaan honge
 Jobs can be blown away by anyone's senses
 pareshaani main pradarshan karenge
 Media will search for coverage of the performance
 vahi media jo kashmir main logon kaa haal lene nahin gaya
 You let him become a part of the government
 ab vahi log jab media media karenge to koi nahin aayega
 Obviously, they will speak to the media
 lekin isse pehle unhen aatm chintan karnaa hoga
 Which media have they been watching? Ever wondered why this media is propagating government? Did these people stand with independent media? The answer will have to be answered less widely
 ye log vot kin sawaalon par dete hai ?in sab sawaalon kaa jawaab ve khud ko den
 Now, if you speak, the IT cell on social media will be abused
 kyonki jab iti cell vaale dusron ko gaali de rahe the tab ye log nahin bol rahe the
 Therefore, employees of BSNL and MTNL should not go to the media
 ve aaen bhi to nahin baat kerani chahie
 They should not even go to the opposition because there will also be many people who have been making fun of the opposition
 ab sabhi milakar gandhi ko padhein or satyagrah karen
 This is the only way
 paune do lakh logon ko rojgaar dene vaali companiyaan band ho rahi he
 Food Corporation of India has incurred more than three lakh crores
 bhartiya jivan beemaa ke bhi vilay kii baat ho rahi he
 There is talk of selling BPCL
 sarkaar ko koi nahin roak saktaa he
 Business Standard's first news is that even after the reduction in corporate tax, their earnings will decline in the second quarter of this year

 film kaa naam :toilet - ek prem kathadiarector:shri narayan sinhastar cast:akshay kumaar, bhoomi pednekar, sudhir pandeya, divyendu sharmivadhi:2 ghanta 41 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2
 5 Star For the past few years, actor Akshay Kumar has appeared to be part of films based on biopic or real issues
 unki airlift, rustam, baby, jolly elelbi 2 jaisi filmon ne darshakon ko cinemaghar tak jane kii aadat dalava di he
 And this time, Akshay has said to get everyone's attention on the important issue 'toilet' in the village
 film ko emes dhoni, special chhbbees, baby or a vednesade jaisi filmon ko edit karne vaale shrinarayan singh ne diarect kiya he
 So how Akshay Kumar and Mr
 Narayan Singh have done- Let's know: The story is related to many houses
 This story is about Keshav (akshay Kumar), a Mangalik boy from a village near Mathura city
 is vajah se 36 saal kaa hote huye bhi uski shaadi nahin ho rahi he
 First she is married to a buffalo (mallika)
 keshav kii ek saaikal kii dukaan he or ek din jab wo saaikal delivery karne jaya (bhoomi pednekar) ke ghar jaataa he to ankhon ankhon main pyaar ho jaataa he or phir shaadi bhi
 But the story begins when Jaya in-laws comes after the wedding and discovers that the house does not have a toilet
 vah aise ghar main rahane se saaf manaa kar detii he or phir kai rudhivaadee baaten saamne aati he or kahani main alag-alag kirdaar apane apane paatro ko nibhaate hue kahani ko aage le jate hai
 Toilet on these things will be praised by a love story - the film's direction, cinematography, location are good
 gaanv kii real loketions ke shoot kamaal ke lagate hai
 Fake branded tshirts worn by Akshay look real and funny
 - film main 'khule main shouch' ke mudde ko darshane kii koshish kii gai he jo amuman second half se shuru hoti he
 Before the interval, a story focusing on Keshav and Jaya's love is shown
 - film ke kai samvaad prabhavit karte hai
 For example, as long as the problem is not personal, who will fight, who can solve it or your fight with civilization etc
 saath hi sarkaar kii svachh bharat abhiyaan ke antargat gaanv main kya-kya niyam-kanoon hai, ke bare main bhi bataaya gaya he
 - Akshay Kumar's acting is excellent and commendable
 kirdaar ko bakhub nibhaayaa gaya he
 At the same time, Bhumi Pednekar has also done a smooth job
 sudhir pandeya or pyaar kaa panchnaama vaale divyendu aapako hairaan karte hai
 The rest of the co-stars have also acted in terms of the film itself
 akshay kumaar or bhoomi pednekar kaa monolog kamaal kaa he jo sochane par vivash bhi karata he
 The weak music in the long film makes the film's point that its length is too long and editing on it must have been done
 first half jahaan kaam chalau he vahiin second half main bhi kahani kaaphi khinchi hui lagati he
 Before becoming director, Srinarayan has edited films like Airlift, Rustom, Baby, Jolly LLB 2
 is baar bhi wo hunar prayog main achche se laana chaiye tha
 As for the music of the film, it is average
 lath maar vaala geet hi kuch acha lagata he
 There is a little bit of sloppiness, and in the film there is a bit of sloppiness, like Akshay's dialogue about whether the woman washes what i can handle, or the sister-in-law became a milk shop etc
 ye jabardastee se thunse gaye dialogs lagate hai
 The reasons for the toilet scam and non-construction are also shown, but there is no such thing that goes directly to the heart
 vahiin film main naa hi romance mukammal ho paaya he or naa hi mudde par baat
 Everything has become confusing
 box offisfilm kaa bajet lagbhag 18 karod he or kaha ja rahaa he kii akshay ne apni fees nahin lee he balki wo profit share karne vaale hai
 Many brands have also been promoted in the film
 film 3200 se zyada screens main relies kii jaaegi
 And the point is that big weekends are expected
 saare aankade milakar film kii recovery cost 105 karod he
 That is, it will be called a hit only on the earnings of 110-115 crores and a super hit on a gross of 140 crores
 vaise beete kuch samay main jis tarahabollywoodki filmein flop ho rahi hai, use dekhte hue to toilet ek prem katha kaa itani kamai karnaa jaruri bhi he

 After this, the Modi government came to power

 Qadian says that the way the salary increases by three percent every year, the pension should also increase by three percent every year

 People have reservations about this too

 For the first time a woman finance minister was addressing the country, so the expectation was increased from them, but after reading the budget book, looking at the budget area for children, we found that this is the lowest provision in the last ten years
 pichley das saalon main desh ne do pramukh dalon kii sarkaron ko dekha he, yah kehete hue niraashaa hoti he ki bajet main bacchon ko praathamikta se shaamil karne kii vah drushti donon jagah hi gaayab he, pichley paanch saalon main to yah or bhi niraashajanak he

 acchhee baat he ki isko alag karke dekha jaataa he yani ki ek puraa dastavej hi bacchon ke kalyaan se judi yojanaon par aadhaarit hota he

 The better the citizens get, the better the education will be and the better citizens will make their country ahead, so the amount allocated on education is not a burden on the country, it is investment, how afraid of investing to build a better nation? We are afraid to invest on the children of our family, no, then why do we have to skimp with the children of the country? That too in a time when all the standards and political-economic scenario and the network of global, marketist policies demand this
 That they will be made better by spending more and more on public sector
 is maamle main phir bajet aavanton aapako chidhaayenge
 Ten years ago, about 83 percent of the total budget allocated for children was being spent on education and marginalized children, now this amount is about 67
 6 pratishat par aa gai he, takreeban 16 pratishat kaa nivesh shiksha jaise sabase mahatvapurn kshetra par kam kar diya
 Would the country ten years ago be more sensitive to education, think and ask why did we have this skimpful behavior on the most important area of children, have we not opened up the path of privatization by showing this intention, is it all Together and everyone is behaved in a manner conducive to the concept of development, and will it benefit the marginalized children, who fall under the category of Antyodaya, and Gandh Referring to Shri 150, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said about it

 But why the government is not able to show seriousness in the matters of children? 4 of the total budget allocation of health children in 2010-11 for ten years
 4 pratishat hisse kaa nivesh kiya gaya tha, yah pichley das saal kaa sarvaadhik pratishat he
 After this only 4 in 2017-18 a year
 2 pratishat rahaa, lekin is saal yah ghatakar saadhe teen pratishat par aa gaya he
 This year the government 3218 on children's health
 33 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 Better health will occur only when better nutrition is provided
 neshnal family health survey-4 kahata he ki desh main takreeban 35
 8 percent of the children are still malnourished

 Ten years ago this allocation 20 of the budget for total children
 6 pratishat tha

 yun to aapane mahadev ke kai mandiron ke darshan kiye honge, unke kai rup bhi dekhe honge
 Just think, if the size of the temple itself tells the glory of Mahadev and the power of Mahadev is realized as soon as he enters the temple, then what better luck than that
 karnataka ke kolar jile main duniya kaa sabase ooncha shivlinga maujuud he, jiske chaaron taraf maujuud karondon shivlinga shiv ke prati unke bhakton kii bhakthi kii anuthi kahani sunaate hai
 a temple of Mahadev, situated in the greenery of the holy, beautiful and tranquil nature, tells the story of this temple being the most unique
 man ko har lene vaali isaki sundarataa main swayan mahadev kaa vaas hota he or yahaan kan-kan shiv kii shakti kii kahani sunaata he 
 This temple has the world's highest Shivling as well as about 1 crore Shivling
 ise kotelingeshwar dham kehete hai, jo karnataka ke kolar jile ke ek chote se gaanv kammasandara main basaa he
 Upon entering this temple, the devotees eye a tuck only to see the shape of the temple because it is situated in the form of Mahadev, which is perhaps the only one of its kind in the world
 yahaan mandir kaa aakaar hi shivlinga ke rup main he, jo duniya kaa sabase ooncha shivlinga bhi he
 The height of this temple in the form of Shivling is 108 feet
 jiske darshan kar shraddhalu puri tarah se shivamay ho jate hai or isaki gavaahi dete hai mandir ke chaaron ore maujuud kareeb 1 karod shivlinga
 One may wonder why millions of Shivling are installed around the main temple
 yahaan aane vaale shraddhaluon kii manokamana main is achambhe kaa raaj chipa he
 Devotees come to this temple with true devotion in their mind and according to their ability, get the Shivling ranging from 1 feet to 3 feet, installed here in their name
 ye mahadev kii mahima hi he ki ab in shivlingon kii sankhya kareeb 1 karod tak pahunch chuki he
 In front of this huge Shiva-linga, Nandi appears in a grand and spacious form, which is 35 feet in height and is situated on a platform 60 feet long, 40 feet wide and 4 feet high
 is vishaal shiv-ling ke chaaron ore devi maa, shri ganesh, shri kumaraswami or nandi maharaj kii pratimaayein aise sthapit hai jaise ve apane aradhy ko apni puja arpan kar rahe hon
 This amazing form of the temple and the belief that every vow will be completed, draws thousands of devotees from far and wide
 mandir ke andar pravesh karte hi kotelingeshwar kii pratimaa main bhakton ko saakshaat mahadev ke darshanon kii anubhuti hoti he or kotelingeshwar rup main bhole apane bhakton ke kashton ko harne ke liye aatur dikhaayi detii hai
 In addition to the main temple of Kotilingeshwar, there are 11 temples in this entire temple complex, in which the temples of Brahma, Vishnu, Annapurneshwari Devi, Venkataramani Swamy, Panduranga Swamy, Panchmukh Ganapati, rama-lakshmana-sita are mainly seated
 manyata he kii mandir parisar main maujuud do vrikshon par pile dhaage ko baandhne se har manokamana puri ho jaati he
 In particular, the problems of marriage are removed
 mandir kii taraf se bhi nirdhan-garib pariwaron kii kanyaon kaa vivaah nammaatr kaa shulk lekar karavaaya jaataa he
 All the arrangements are done on behalf of the temple
 vahiin, dur-dur se aane vaale bhakton ke rahane-khaane kaa bhi yahaan uchit intjaam kiya jaataa he
 On the day of Mahashivratri, the sight of this temple is made
 apane aradhy dev ko apane shraddha-suman arpan kar punya laabh kamaane vaale shraddhaluon kii sankhya 2 lakh tak pahunch jaati he
 There are other miraculous temples of Mahadev: It seems a bit strange to hear the twin temple of Mahadev, but there is a temple on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, where Mahadev is seen in two forms under one roof
 is mandir main do-do nandi bhi hai or wo bhi aamane-saamne
 It is said that whoever gets the good fortune to see these forms of Mahadev attains salvation
 agra ke kailash mandir main bhi ek saath 2 shivlinga puuje jate hai
 Here the form of Mahadev is as miraculous, as are the stories of miracles
 tabhi bhagwaan parashuram bhi mahadev ke is rup ko nahin pahchaan sake or do-do shivlingon kii sthapana kar di

 In the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Cuttack, both team India openers Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane made excellent batting, both sharing a 231-run partnership for the first wicket
 or to or donon ne shatak bhi lagaae
 Both openers added a century to Rickard Booksey
 team india ke liye yah record itnaa ahm isliye bhi he ki wo ab tak 864 vanade khel chuki he or ek hi match main donon opebers ke centuri lagane kaa yah keval chatha mauka he
 It can also be understood that a total of 3539 odis have been played in world cricket so far and this has happened only for the 28th time
 yani bharat ke alaava keval 22 baar yah record banaaya ja sakaa
 In a way, the Indian audience got such a batting after almost 11 years because it has been 11 years since both the openers of Team India have scored a century in the same match in one day
 tab sachin or sahvaag ne newjiland ke khilaaf yah karnama kiya tha
 The duo's batting reminded them of the era of Sachin, Sehwag and Ganguly
 yah wo daur tha jab vanade cricket main baar-baar 300 ranon se upar kaa score banane kaa silsilaa shuru hua tha
 It was a period when it seemed that the batsmen like Ganguly, Sehwag, Sachin, Yuvraj and Dravid would make the team less than 300 runs
 dhawan ne jab apane pehle match main hi shandaar centuri lagaai thi to laga tha ki sahvaag kii kami nahin khalegi
 But for the past one year, his bat was craving for Century
 katak main unhone apane kariyar kaa chatha shatak lagaakar jahaan apane balle kii bhukh mitaai, vahiin team india ke liye world cap ke openar ke rup main ek or kadam aage bhi badhaayaa
 On the other hand, Rahane, who was called as the batsman of the Test after a century at Lord's, also scored a century at Edgbaston, just five matches before the century in Cuttack and his strike rate in this match (102
 77) bhi shandaar rahaa
 Overall, he has now not only fit in the ODI format but has also become a solid option for opening
 is batting parformens ke baad nishchit hi chayankarta unhen world cap ke openar ke rup main apshan ke rup main dekhne lage honge
 With the World Cup to be played in february-march next year, seeing the batting of Shikhar Dhawan and Rahane, it would not be wrong to say that they have emerged as the best opening pair after Sachin, Sehwag and Ganguly
 inamen he cricket kii acchhee samajhamatch ke dauraan ek aisa vaakya aayaa ki sunil gavaskar jaise diggaj bhi rahane kii saraahna karne se nahin chuke
 During the match, when Ambati Rayudu hit a straight drive and the ball hit the bowler with a non-striker end and went to the wicket, Ajinkya Rahane threatened to be dismissed
 lekin yahaan unhone balla apane daayen haath main pakad rakhaa tha or use ghasitate hue krij main le gaye jisase wo bal bal batch gaye
 Commentary veteran Sunil Gavaskar then praised him and said that the new batsmen should learn in which hand should the bats stand on the non-striker end
 opebers kaa ran bananaa acha sanketashikhar dhawan or ajinkya rahane ke shatak ko jahaan cricket ke diggaj acha sanket maan rahe hai vahiin dhawan ne bhi kaha he ki top order ke batsman achche farm main hai or shatak banane ke baad unka bhi apane upar bharosa badha he
 Dhawan scored 113 runs in this innings while Man of the Match Ajinkya Rahane scored 111 runs
 dhawan ne kaha, ‘majboot buniyaad ke liye yah behad mahatvapurn he
 'he said,' When you play like this, you have increased confidence in yourself and feel good if you participate in such participation

 In the name of friendship so far, the neighbor whose house Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken away with the message of love, he once again did what he is known for
 kyonki khabar he ki padosi mulk ne aatanki hamale ke kareeb ek maheene baad abhi tak maamle main ek FIR tak darj nahin kii he, jabaki uske aakaa navaj sharif duniya bhar main ghumkar is ore jaanch puri hone kaa vigyaapan dete phir rahe hai
 This is also true of Pakistan, whose Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, while returning from Davos, had advised that India and Pakistan should not interfere in each other's affairs
 yahi nahin, tab unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki pathankot hamale kii jaanch puri ho gai he or jald hi vah is ore jaankaree saarvajanik karne vaale hai
 While the truth is that an FIR has not been registered for the investigation in the case
 na hiraasat, na giraftaarpakistan kii sachai kaa yah maamla sirf exiaar tak nahin he
 Despite all the evidence from India in this case, neither Maulana Masood Azhar has been detained nor arrested yet
 yahi nahin, pakistan ne jaanch ke naam par jin teen logon ko hiraasat main liya, vah koun hai or kya jaankaree hasil hui isko lekar bhi bharat ke saath kuch saajha nahin kiya gaya he
 India has not yet been informed by the neighboring country under which law and under which sections it has taken action in the case
 haalanki, pakistan lagaataar yah jarur kah rahaa he ki jaanch antim rup main he or jo phone number saboot ke taur par bharat ne die vah farji hai
 Interestingly, Pakistan has set up a probe team of six people, just for show
 kya kaha navaj sharif karyaalay nepakistan kaa yah doharaa ravaiya aise samay bhi saamne aayaa he, jabakinvaaj sharifke karyaalay ne beete dinon kaha ki pathankot maamle main pichley maheene teen sandigdhon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he jinamein jaish pramukh masood ajahar bhi shaamil he
 On 12 January, the Pakistani Prime Minister's Office submitted a preliminary inquiry report to India, stating that it needed more evidence to arrest Masood Azhar
 masood ajahar khuleam ugal rahaa jaharanvaaj sharif kehete hai ki pakistan bharat ke saath dosti badhaane ko lekar bahut utsuk he, lekin ek sachai yah bhi he ki is bich moulana masood ajahar khuleam bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugal rahaa he
 On 26th January i

 on the occasion of Indian Republic Day, he has set fire against India in a jihadi magazine
 apane lekh main aatanki ne pakistan sarkaar ko jaish ke khilaaf karrwai rokane kii chetavanee di he
 However, in the midst of all this, India has started the exercise of handing over more evidence to Pakistan

 pradhanmantri narendra modi padosi desh nepal ke apane tisare daure par aaj ja rahe hai
 The tour is said to give a new dimension to the contacts between the people of the two countries
 nepal bharat kii videsh niti main hameshaa se ahm desh rahaa he
 But in recent years, due to China's growing interest in South Asia, India has become quite aware of Nepal
 nepal pahari desh he jisaki seemaa sirf do deshon se hi lagati he
 India from three sides and China from Tibet
 apni jaruraton ke liye nepal kaaphi had tak bharat par nirbhar he
 But for India, in the context of Nepal, China's challenge is now becoming as big as the Himalayan Mountains
 nepal main pichley ek dashak main aae raajnneetik badlaav, maovadi takaton kaa satta main aana or china kii nepal main entry bharat ke liye badi chunauti he or modi sarkaar ko in sabake bich bharat kaa steke surakshit rakhana hoga
 Several aspects of the relationship of the three countries are raising India's concern
 pradhanmantri oli kii china se najdiki ko lekar satark bharatchin ke pariprekshya membharat-nepalke rishton main haal ke dinon main kaaphi utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko mila he
 KP Sharma Oli, a Maoist leader considered close to China and the Prime Minister of Nepal, made his first foreign tour of India in his second political innings
 ve 6-8 april ke bich bharat daure par the jabaki unhen china daure kaa bhi nyotaa mila tha
 This was seen as Nepal's attempt to strike a balance between the two countries
 tripaksheeya sahyog kaa card khel rahaa he chitprail ke tisare hafte main nepal ke videsh mantri pradeep gyawali china ke daure par the
 China announced all projects including railways connecting Nepal and hoped that India would also come together for the prosperity of Nepal
 lekin bharat is tripaksheeya pariyojna ko lekar ruchi nahin dikhaa rahaa
 Because there is doubt in India about China
 isse pehle nepal main optical fibre pariyojna, internet seva samet kai elaan china nepal ke liye kar chukaa he
 But is it so easy for India to be a part of this alliance? ji bilkul nahin
 What is China's intention behind trilateral cooperation? China's strategy behind the offer of trilateral cooperation is clearly visible here
 china nepal ke samaaj or vahaan kii vyavastha main bharat kii paith ko samajhataa he aise main vah bharat ke saath bina takaraav kii mudra ke nepal main apana aarthik, ranneetik or sainya hastkshep badhaate rahanaa chahta he
 Maoist leader Oli is also in a very favorable position for China
 alag tarah kaa rahaa he bharat-nepal kaa rishtabharat kaa nepal ke saath alag tarah kaa rishta rahaa he
 From Nepal's politics to foreign policy, India's influence has been very strong
 nepal kii ek badi aabaadi bharat main naukariyaan yaa anya tarah ke rojgaar se judi he
 Visa is not required for movement between Nepal and India
 bhartiya rupaya nepal main bedadak chalata he
 Nepal takes most of its goods from India
 ek anumaan ke mutabik bharat bhar main 20 lakh se adhik nepali naagarik rahete hai, kaam karte hai or unamem adhikansh to yaheen bas gaye hai
 While the number of Nepalese people living in China and Hong Kong is not more than 20 thousand
 bharat main nepali naagarik kaam, ilaaj, padhai, naukariyon, rojgaar ke liye aasaani se aa ja sakate hai jabaki china main awajahi aasaan nahin he
 Things changed after the formation of the Maoist government, but the situation has changed since the formation of the Maoist government there
 capi oli ke pichley shasankaal main bharat ke saath nepal ke rishton main talkhi badi thi or hamaara padosi desh nepal china ke kareeb gaya tha
 Therefore, India will also see the new initiative of Oli with skepticism
 nepal kii nai sarkaar kii praathamikta china ke saath rishton ko vistaar dekar bharat par aarthik nirbharta kam karne kii dikh rahi he
 Oli's suggestion that Nepal wants to move forward by collaborating with both neighboring countries is a sign of this
 nepal bharat se itar vaikalpik margon kii talash main kyon?nepal ek land locd state he or samjhaute ke jariye videsh vyapaar ke liye uski najar china ke bandargahon ke istemaal par he
 Currently most of Nepal's imports and exports are with India and it is completely dependent on India's ports
 lekin 2015 main madhesi andolan ke samay bharat se seemaa vyapaar rukne ke kaaran vahaan kaaphi dikkatein badi thim
 What are the Chinese projects in Nepal, Nepal does not want to let such a situation come forward and is working on preparing an alternative route with China instead of complete business dependence on India
 donon deshon ke bich tibet hote hue do hive ke nirmaan, bandargahon kii marammat, train seva or hawaii seva ke vistaar par baat hui he
 China is interested in the project of the rail line from Kerong to Kathmandu, Kathmandu to Pokhara and Lumbini
 gauratlab he ki lumbini bharat-nepal kii seemaa par sthit he or mahatma buddha kii janmasthali hone ke kaaran bharat ke liye kaaphi ahm he
 India has expressed its concern with diplomatic channels, describing the project as sensitive to Indian security interests
 bharat ne bhi nepal ke liye badhaayaa aavantanchin kii ore se pesh chunauti ko dekhte hue bharat ne bhi apni pariyojnaon par kaam tej kiya he
 From the month of April of this financial year, India has decided to allocate Rs 650 crore for Nepal
 bharat ne nepal ko di jane vaali sahaayta raashi main pichley saal kii tulana main 73 pratishat tak vruddhi kii he
 Negotiations are also proceeding with India on Nepal's rail link
 capi sharma oli ke is daure ke dauraan bharat-nepal ke bich kathmandu-raksol rail link par samjhauta hua
 India is trying to challenge the rail link of China by extending this project further
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki china or bharat main se koun pahari desh nepal ko pehla rail link dene kaa kaam puraa karata he
 One Belt One Road Challenger has also joined China’s One Belt One Road Project
 nepal china se kai border post khulwakar vyapaarik aadan-pradaan badhaane kii taak main bhi he
 Apart from this, China is also working in the project of International Airport in Pokhara, Kathmandu Ring Road
 china kaa badhata dakhal bharat ko majaboor kar rahaa he ki vah nepal main apni pariyojnaon par kaam tej kare, apana nivesh badaye
 People from India reach more Chinese tourists Nepal's people-to-people Connect with China is also growing rapidly
 is saal janvari se march ke bich nepal main 36,384 chini tourist aae jabaki isi dauraan 34,133 bhartiya tourist nepal pahunche
 China's focus on military cooperation also increased rapidly in nepal-china friendship at military level
 pichley saal nepal or china kii sena ne pehla sanyukt abhyaas kiya
 There have been 40 high-level visits between the two countries in the last 6 years
 nepal ke raajnneetik dal or buddhijivi tabaka china ke biarai project ko pragati ke bade maukey ke taur par dekh rahaa he
 At the same time, the work being done on slow projects with the cooperation of India is making the situation of India even more complicated
 bharat kin baton ko lekar he sajagabhutan ke baad nepal ke saath paaramparik rup se bharat ke sambandh kaaphi achche rahe hai lekin ab vahaan china kii chunauti he or aise main bharat ko teji se kadam uthaane honge taaki hamaara sabase kareebi padosi desh china jaise pratidwandi ke haath main na chalaa jaae
 PM Modi is starting his tour from Janakdham

 India wants to improve trade and religious connections with Nepal through the Ramayana Circuit
 janakapur se piem modi kii nepal yatra shuru hogi jo ki pipul tu pipul conect kii disha main bada kadam he
 Apart from this, PM Modi will also review the progress of Indian projects going on in Nepal to give a new dimension to bilateral relations
 maujuuda series australia ke naam ho chuki he, lekin viraat kohli ke ravaiye ko lekar bahes jari rahegi
 Perhaps it was Virat Kohli's aggression that led to the Australian team declaring a late innings, so Team India can see this draw as a psychological win
 captain mahendra singh dhoni kehete hai ki unki team lagaataar sikh rahi he, bas, khilaadiyon ko thodaa vakt chahie
 In the Test, this team played poorly for about 45 minutes till now, due to which they had to face defeat
 lekin unhen lagata he ki unki team sikh rahi he or jaldi hi match jitkar behatar nattejey bhi pesh karegi
 Team India director Ravi Shastri says the players have made a mark with their performance in the Melbourne Test
 star tivi par match ke baad sho main unhone kaha ki melbern main pichley 10 saal main kisi team ne pehali baar drow kiya he, or melbern ke darshakon ne ise saraahaa he
 He says that you give this team time of the year and this team will look amazing
 ravi shastri ne viraat kohli or ajinkya rahane kii pariyon kii bhi jamkar tarif kii
 Virat Kohli's half-century in at least the fourth innings is proof that he is not just rhetorical
 team india bhale hi melbern test par kabza karne main naakaam rahi, lekin viraat ne apane aakraamak tevar jari rakhe, yah jaanate hue bhi ki match kii chauthi pari main unhen australian mushkil gendbaazi kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 The feud between Virat Kohli and Mitchell Johnson was feared that if Kohli or Team India's other batsmen would come to the crease, they would face extra sledding from Australia, but the good thing is that Virat with his aggressive attitude- He is also driving his bat
 vah shandaar form main hai or jabardast aatmavishvaas se bhare hai
 Virat's statistics show that in Test cricket he is traveling towards being included in the list of greatest batsmen
 sirf 32 test maichon ke safar main viraat kohli ke naam australia ke khilaaf australian maidaanon par chaar shatkeey paariyaan hai
 He has added 499 runs in six innings so far in the current series
 iske saath hi viraat ne chauthe number par ballebaazi karte hue australia ke khilaaf unki zamin par sachin tendulkar ke record ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 Sachin has 480 runs against Australia in Australia
 australia main kheli gai ek series main sabase zyaada ran banane waalon kii list main vah rahul dravid ke baad duusare number par aa gaye hai
 Rahul Dravid has 619 runs in four Tests, while Virat Kohli has scored 499 runs in three matches, so he still has a chance to beat Rahul Dravid
 test kii chauthi pari main viraat kaa ausat bhartiya khilaadiyon kii list main sabase upar yani 68
 Is 88
 bharat melbern test main jeet hasil nahin kar sakaa, lekin kohli ke hote hue australian team rakshaatmak tareeke se faisla lene par majaboor ho sakati he, yah zarur sabit hua
 So, even though Team India did not win the Test, and the series was named for Australia, but even after this draw, Team India would like to play the Sydney Test assuming that it has won psychologically and it benefits Sydney
 Can be found in the test

 iskaa pehla ehsaas tab hua tha jab maine 10veen board kii pariksha di thi
 Like every student, i also had a dream to pass good numbers in the board exam
 magar jabarijaltaaya to niraashaa haath lagi
 After the result, i felt so shocked that i decided in my mind that i will not study now
 maine yah maan liya ki padhane-likhane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 When my result came, my father went out of the house for some reason
 har ek parents kii tarah mere mummy-papa ko bhi mujhase kaaphi ummiden thim
 He was confident that i would get good marks
 sach bataaun to apane kam number aane se zyada dar mujhe is baat kaa tha ki papa mere bare main kya sochenge, mere dost meraa majaak udaayenge
 Thinking this, i sat in my room and wept for hours
 pataa hi nahin chalaa rote-rote kab so gai
 Suddenly, when i woke up, there was a sound of radio playing from the verandah
 radio par kishor kumaar kaa gaanaa, 'jindagi kii yahi reet he, haar ke baad hi jeet he
 
 
 ' was ringing
 aisa laga jaise ki yah gaanaa mere liye bajaayaa gaya tha
 When i got out of the room, i saw Papa sitting near the radio
 himmat nahin hui baahar jane kii isliye waapas apane kamare main chali gai
 Papa came smiling after a while
 unke haathon main mithai kaa ek dibba tha
 Papa fed me sweets and asked, 'when to buy a bicycle to go to college?' i cried and said, 'my good marks have not come, what will i do by buying a bicycle?' i still remember the answer Papa gave me
 unka kaha, 'tum meri beti ho itani kamjor nahin ho sakati
 How can a small exam spoil your entire career? No one can succeed or fail with a few questions
 asafal ve hote hai jo pariksha se darate hai or mehnat nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 'I tied those words of my father forever and never looked back again
 main jab bhi niraash hoti hum yaa mujhe aage kii raah nahin dikhti he to main apane papa kii baat ko yaad kar leti hum

 The film based on Bal Thackeray's life showed more than half of Thackeray being black and white, but Thackeray's image was shown as white throughout the film
 film un sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab detii he, jinase bal thakare jeevanabhar ghire rahe
 Then whether it is their principle of not believing in democracy, or the support of emergency or the question of ban on outsiders in Maharashtra
 film shuru se hi yah tathy sthapit kar detii he ki bal thakare ko shivasena banane kii jarurat kyon padi? spasht taur par yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki jab bal thakare ek akhbaar main maamuli cartoonist the, tab marathiyon ke saath maharashtra main kitna anyaay ho rahaa tha? iske baad movie main ek-ek kar bal thakare par lage aaropon par safai di gai he
 Despite this, at the end of the film, Thackeray is seen standing in the box
 movie sirf thakare ko ek hero yaa marathiyon kaa maseehaa ke taur par pesh karti he
 This is not a new fact for the audience, but its storyteller Sanjay Raut will present a clean image of Thackeray so hard and strong, it is revealed in the theater itself
 puri film main thakare ke rup main navazuddin siddiki chhaae rahete hai, har seen main unka staradam dikhataa he
 They did not get weak, whether accused of demolishing the Babri Masjid or being involved in the riots
 navaj kii adaakarinvazuddin siddiki apane kirdaar ke saath puraa nyaay karte najar aae hai
 He tried to capture Thackeray's accents, gestures and his bold style, in which his effective dialogues were like chandeliers, but wearing a tight cover at all times could not bring out the side of his life in which he was a father
 , Is also an artist with a husband or a soft heart
 amrutha raav ko thakare kii patni minaa thakare ke rup main screen par jitna spes mila, usase unhone apni damdaar upasthiti darj karai

 All those questions have been justified in which the Shiv Sena's image of cut-off Hindutva, non-marathas are accused of hooliganism and political polarization
 sambhav he ki aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtra main shivasena ko 'thakare' ke kaaran raajnneetik phayda bhi mili
 The viewer reaches the same conclusion at the end of the film that the storyteller is forced to persuade the viewer through small dialogues and scenes, or that any allegations are being clarified
 jaahir he ki thakare apni vichaardhaara ko lekar kaaphi spasht the, jo tamaam media intervyuu main dikhataa bhi he, lekin unke (thakare ) bachaav main film jo tathy pesh karti he, ve kamjor dikhte hai
 The film clearly stays on its agenda till the end
 kahani main kya?kahani kii baat karen to thakare ke jivan ke un sab pahaluon ko baariki se dikhaaya gaya, jo unki raajnneetik vichaardhaara ko prabhavit karte the
 At some places, his image is shown so liberal that he allows a Muslim to read Nawaz at his home, while in the next scene he is seen announcing that he will contest elections on the agenda of Hindutva only
 ve kehete hai ki "logon ke napunsak hone se acha mere logon kaa gunda hona he
 When the backbone of the people was crushed due to exploitation of the system, i taught them to stand upright
 ''apni baat prabhavi tareeke se kehane ke liye camera work or liting kaa nirdeshak abhijit paanse ne bharpoor dohan kiya
 The film shows an image of a godfather of Bal Thackeray, who has the answers to all the allegations against him
 yadi aap anyaay ke khilaaf uth khadey hone vaale jaruratmandon ke maseehaa vaale siddhant ko cinemai tadake ke saath dekhnaa chaahate hai to thakare aapke liye he
 In the film, no other character other than Nawaz emerges, but you will not need anyone other than Nawaz to maintain the engagement

 '' beete loksabhaa chunaav main jat-gurjar matadaataaon ke ek bade tabake kaa samarthan paane vaali bhaajapa is baar isi tabake ko lekar phikrmand he

 Manoj Sivach says, "mayawati is being knocked down by the bsp's Muslim and Dalit leaders
" isi dar se ve kisi bhi keemat par congress ko saath nahin lenaa chaahatin
 The Congress, which has been separated from the BSP, has triangulated the direct contest between the alliance and the BJP by putting up strong candidates in some seats
 congress kii isi ranneeti ne meerut or mujffarnagar tak faili bijanour loksabhaa seat kaa taapmaana badha diya he
 Here, the last Lok Sabha election was lost to Baluch Nagar of BSP, Bharatendra Singh of BJP

 Nagar is in the fray as an alliance candidate from Bijnor seat this time and the Congress has given the ticket to Siddiqui and punished the battlefield for Muslim votes
 isi tarah saharanpur loksabhaa seat par congress ke imran masood or basapa ke haji fajalurrahman aamane-saamne hai
 Maulana Hasanul Hashmi, a Deoband philanthropist, says, "the lack of coordination between the alliance and the Congress has led to a triangular contest in many seats in western UP
" aise main musalmaan matadaataaon ko behad aklmandi se apane mat prayog karnaa hoga

 '' pashchimi upi main bhaajapa apni har chunavi sabhaaon main pakistan main air strike, aatankwaad, kumbh ke safal aayojan ke saath kanvad yatra kaa zikr kar rahi he
 In fact, the BJP, trapped in a direct electoral battle in the Lok Sabha seats like Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, is hoping to feed lotus on these seats through polarization
 is baar loksabhaa chunaav main basapa or sapa ne apane muslim netaaon ko akaaran aise bayanon se bachane ko kaha he jisase bhaajapa ko musalmaan virdohi bhavanaaen bhadakaane kaa mauka mili
 Says Manohar Singh, associate professor at Meerut University, "the controversial statements of Muslim leaders in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly elections had united Hindu voters against them, which benefited the BJP
" is baar musalmaan netaaon ke sanyam baratane ke kaaran pichley chunaavon jaisi sthiti nahin he

 *** kya vayaskon kii patrika plaboy ko intervyuu dene vaale pehle piem the nehru? yah sawaal soshal media par chaaya rahata he
 At times controversial comments are made about the legacy of Nehru and the Congress Party
 haal hi main ek twitor acount @churumuri se is masale par phir se bahes shuru kii gai
 This account has about 50,000 followers, including many big personalities
 isamen kisi Maithun (24°C) ke ek twit (@being_humor) kaa hawala diya gaya he, jinhone plaboy patrika ke kisi kathith twit ke aadhaar par daawa kiya he ki nehru ne vastav main is patrika ko intervyuu diya tha
 According to @churumuri it is the work of 'fake monsters' of India
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki @playboy kaa twit asal main farji he
 In view of this debate, we decided to do a viral test on playboy-nehruism, which everyone knows about, but people do not understand who to trust
 hamane Maithun (24°C) (@being_humor) ke twit par najar rakhni shuru kar di, jisamen yah daawa kiya gaya tha ki plaboy patrika ne khud nehru ke intervyuu ke bare main twit kiya he
 On seeing the Twitter timeline, we see that Maithun (24 ° C) (@being_humor) tweeted about it on October 12, 2017
 apane twit main usne congress par tanj kasate hue likhaa tha # knowyourlegacy or is baat par jor diya tha ki, 'congress ne is twit ko delit karvaa diya
 'we tried to verify the authenticity of Maithun (24 ° C) tweets and the claims being made on the basis of it
 plaboy patrika kaa twitor handle @playboy he or iske 14
 There are 3 lakh followers
 hamane @playboy ke timeline kii kaaphi gahanta se jaanch kii, lekin hamen nehru ke intervyuu ke bare main koi twit nahin mila
 Now the question arises whether there was a tweet that was later deleted by @playboy, which Maithun (24 ° C) is claiming, we cannot say anything concretely about it
 @churumuri kaa yah kahana sahi he ki Maithun (24°C) ke twit main jo font dikh rahaa he, vah twitor dwaara istemaal kiye ja rahe font se alag he
 It is also worth noting that in the tweet of Maithun (24 ° C), Jawaharlal Nehru's spelling has been written wrongly
 usamen likhaa he-“jawsharlal” jabaki daawa yah kiya gaya he ki yah @playboy kaa twit he jise congress ne delit karvaa diya
 Now come to the debate question - Did Playboy interview Jawaharlal Nehru? Us about it www
 forbes
 Raunak d featured on October 3, 2017 in com
 desai kaa ek vistaar se likhaa lekh mila
 It is reported in this article that Jawaharlal Nehru's interview was actually published in the October 1963 issue of Playboy magazine
 ise patrika dwaara 1962 main shuru kiye gaye 'plaboy intervyuu' siries ke tahat prakashit kiya gaya tha
 To get to the bottom of this fact, we reached the previous issue of Playboy magazine
 oktober, 1963 sanskaran kii patrika ke cover pej par khubasurat model elsa martinelli kii shararti muskaan vaali tasviir di gai he or cover par hi garv se yah ghoshnaa kii gai he- 'bharat ke nehru ke saath ek exclusive intervyuu'
 Page 51 of this edition of the magazine is a detailed interview and is printed in several pages
 intervyuu kii shuruyaat main likhaa gaya he, 'pradhanmantri nehru ne yah exclusive intervyuu apane 10, teen murti maarg, nai dilli awaas ke gudahal kii sugandh se bhare parisar main diya
 Puffing up his charred Gandhi cap and brown frock coat and a cigarette
 
 
 vah din bhar main paanch cigarette hi pite hai
 
 
 The interviewer is not named in this article, but the cover mentions Fota at the beginning with a Playboy interview by Henry Slaser
 henry slasar ek america naatakkaar, lekhak or copy riter the, jinka 2002 main nidhan ho gaya
 In this interview, Nehru spoke on a wide range of issues ranging from Mahatma Gandhi to Ravindra Nath Tagore, the Chinese attack, the non-aligned Movement
 ab agar nehru ke intervyuu kaa itnaa majboot dastaveji pramaan maujuud he to isko lekar itnaa vivaad kyon he?isamen kaha gaya he-'patrika kaa baaki hissaa jab prakaashan ke liye press main ja chukaa tha, hamen washington sthit bhartiya duutavas se yah sandesh aayaa ki hamane piem nehru kaa jo intervyuu liya he, vah vastav main bharat ke pramukh ke saath exclusive, vyaktigat baatcheet par aadhaarit nahin tha, balki pradhanmantri dwaara pichley varshon main die tamaam bhaashanon, bayanon aadi kaa sankalan hi he
 This means that according to the Indian embassy, nehru never gave any interview to Playboy and the alleged interviewer simply gave the interview form by gathering the publicly available Nehru statements and other information and printing it
 Sent to Playboy magazine for
 lekin sampadak ke isi note main patrika dwaara daawa kiya gaya he ki 'nehru ke bare main hamen saamagree ek sammanit patrkaar-prakaashak ne bheji he, jinhone iske pehle duniya bhar main aise tamaam prasiddh hastiyon kaa intervyuu liya he
 It was sold to us as a real interview, it was recorded on tape and was accompanied by a covering letter stating that the material also included a photo of the Prime Minister and the journalist with him
 ' isliye is intervyuu kii vaidhata par andeh karne kii koi vajah nahin thi or hamane ise achche vishwaas ke saath ek personal intervyuu ke rup main prakashit kiya
 However, despite the controversy, Playboy never published the alleged photo of the interviewed journalist with Nehru, so doubts remained
 forbes
 According to com's article, 'nehru's so-called Playboy interview got a lot of buzz in India too
 desh ke naitikwaadi logon kii vajah se patrika pehle se hi bharat main pratibandhit thi
 But the October issue of Playboy became one of the most sought-after contraband items in the country
 cover par nehru ke naam kii vajah se is patrika kii pratiyaan badi sankhya main desh main taskari ke madhyam se aane lageen, vah bhi asal keemat se 30 guna tak ke daam par
 As the editor of a newspaper says, 'the October issue was getting more expensive than a bottle of Shivaj Regal
 'varshon se jari is vivaad kii vajah se plaboy patrika kaa oktober 1963 ke is ank kii aaj bhi kaaphi maang he
 But there is still no firm answer to this question - did Nehru actually interview Playboy

 Rajesh Joshi gave this answer to Saeed Ansari during the discussion on what changed in Bhopal after the gas tragedy
 charchaa main shaayarmanjarbhopali bhi shaamil the
 Rajesh Joshi said, "A lot has changed
 har shahar jis dhang se badalte rahe hai bhopal bhi badla he
 Nature has made Bhopal very beautiful
 lekin yojanakaaron ne ise zyada badsoorat kiya he
 The funny thing is that both these things have happened together in Bhopal
 "rajesh joshi ne kaha, "bhopal main agar teen chaar murtiyon ko chhod den to anya jo lagaayee gai hai wo kala kii drushti se galat hai
 Even the idol of Rajabhoja is infamous

 sadakon ko banane or chaudaa karne ke liye jitne ped kaate gaye utane lagaae nahin gaye
 The roads of Bhopal were good, but unfortunately the work of destroying its greenery was also done
 "shaayar manjar bhopali ne kaha, "sari duniya main mushaairon ke liye jaataa hum, lekin bhopal jaise shahar kam hai
 To me, a city is beautiful because its people are also very beautiful
 gujarat yaa bihar main jo chal rahaa he use dekhie to yahaan (bhopal or madhya pradesh main) vaisaa nahin he
 People of all religions live together here
 " rajesh joshi ne bhopal kii galiyon ke bare main apni siries se kuch kavitaayen bhi sunai

 gauratlab he ki jab aamir ko vyomakesh bakshi kii script sunai gai, unheen dinon aditya chopra ne aamir ko film 'dhooma 3' kii bhi script sunai thi

 He said that talk is done through mobile but the waves generated by it can cause pollution problems in the atmosphere

 Today technology is being resorted to for pleasure and comfort, but real pleasure cannot be realized with technology

 The Chief Minister said that today the world has gone far ahead in the field of IT

 sonia gandhi mangalvaar ko karnataka main congress kii ore se chunaav prachaar karne utrin
 He held an election meeting in Bijapur and fiercely attacked the ruling BJP government at the center
 sonia gandhi ne kareeb 2 saal baad kisi chunavi raily main bhaashan diya he
 Earlier, before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, on August 3, 2016, she went to road show in PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 is dauraan unki tabiyat bighad gai or unhen airlift kar turant dilli laayaa gaya tha
 Since then, she was away from campaigning
 is bich gujarat or punjab samet kai rajyon main chunaav hue, lekin sonia ne unamem bhaashan nahin diya
 It can be understood how important the Karnataka assembly elections are for the Congress
 sonia ne karnataka main apni pehali raily main piem narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Here, he took aim at the BJP government's four years of functioning more than counting the achievements of Siddaramaiah's government in Karnataka
 jaaniye piem modi par unhone koun se 10 bade hamale kiye
 1- You must have heard that Siddaramaiah's government has also started Indira Canteen, in which the poor get food
 dukh kii baat he ki congress ke virdohi hamaari asardaar yojanaon kaa virodh karte hai
 We had started the MNREGA scheme to provide employment to people across the country
 tab bhi bhaajapa or narendra modi ji ne iskaa majaak udaaya tha
 2- Annadata is facing many difficulties in Karnataka, there was such a drought in four years as it had not in ten years
 isliye aapke mukhyamantri ji ne modi ji se samay maanga taaki aapako madad mil sake
 Modi ji refused to help him and even met the Chief Minister
 main modi ji se poochna chaahati hum ki unhone na keval siem kaa balki karnataka kii janata kaa bhi apmaan kyon kiya?3- jin rajyon main sookhaa padaa, modi sarkaar ne un rajyon ko hajaaron karod die, lekin karnataka ke kisaanon ke ghaavon par namak chhidakte hue unhen sabase kam paisa diya
 i ask, Modi ji, is this your company, everybody's development? Siddaramaiah ji waived the debts of 22 lakh farmers
 iske alaava or bhi yojanaayen shuru kin, jisase falon, subjiyon or masaalon ke niryaat main teen sabase agrim rajyon main shumaar ho gaya
 4- Congress is working for development, then Modi ji is doing good work for Congress for four years
 modiji par congress mukt bharat kaa junun he, unhen congress mukt bharat kaa bhoot laga he
 Leave Congress-free India, he cannot accept anyone in front of him
 5- modi ji ko is baat kaa garv he ki vah bahut acha bhaashan dete hai, main is baat se sahamat hum
 He is a good orator and gives a speech like an actor
 agar unke bhaashan se desh kaa pet bhar saktaa he to vah or bhi bhaashan den
 But speech alone cannot fill the stomach, for this, pulse and rice are needed
 modi ji ke bhaashan se biimaar thik nahin ho sakate, iske liye aspataal chahie
 Modi's speech cannot empower my sisters, youth cannot get employment, farmers cannot get relief and facilities
 iske liye majboot iraadaa or nek sankalp hona chahie
 6- Inflation is touching the sky
 samaaj kaa har tabaka jindagi main musiibat jhel rahaa he, aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Not caring about all this, the Modi government is increasing the prices of petrol-diesel and domestic gas
 7- desh yah dekhakar hairat main he ki piem modi jahaan bhi jate hai galat hi bolte hai, itihaas ke saath khilwaad karte hai, swatantraaa senaniyon kaa apni raajnneeti ke liye shatranj kii tarah istemaal karte hai
 Does talking to this method suit a PM? Have you ever seen a PM who talks only about things and keeps silent on the real issues, does not speak even a single thing? 8- Which of the promises fulfilled to the public four years ago, tell that What have you done for the farmers of the country, what have you done to give employment to the youth, what have you done for the middle class, women, children, Dalits for the protection of backward people? What happened to the received promises? Why was the Lokpal not brought even after four years? What is your model for eradicating corruption? People who live around you in Karnataka or people who are accused of corruption in Delhi or you will adopt the model of your closest partner's son? 10-congress culture is to connect and bring people together, Modi ji Are, make hollow promises and go on spreading hatred
 aap bhaajapa kii is ranneeti ko safal mat hone dijie, unke ek-ek jumale kaa pardaafash kiijie
 Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khanki's much-awaited film "kedarnath" is in the news before its release
 nirmaan ke dauraan hue aapasi vivaad kii vajah se film kii relies talati rahi
 It was said that the film will be released in 2019 itself
 lekin pichley dinon film kaa tiger jari hua or ab charchaa he ki film disambar main relies ho jaaegi
 The story of the film is based on the natural calamity of Uttarakhand in 2013, in which devotees who went on a pilgrimage lost their lives in a big way
 abhishek kapur ke nirdesan main bani film kaa nirmaan roni scruwala ke production ne kiya he
 Three reasons for discussing this film are very special
 pehla, lead actress ke taur par sara ali khan kii casting
 Sara is the daughter of Saif Ali Khan and his first wife Amrita Singh
 sara ke debyue film hone kii vajah se is par charchaa shuru hui
 Second, financial disputes arose between the film's producer and director, the controversy so much that it reached the court and it was said that the film would be damaged due to the controversy
 isaki relies date ko lekar bhi mushkilen najar aane lagi
 The third and biggest reason is the great natural disaster of Uttarakhand
 ek aisi aapadaa jisamen vibhinn, kshetra, jati or samaaj se gaye shraddhaluon ke saikadon parivaar prakruti ke coup kaa shikaar hue
 He had to lose his life
 View this post on instagramno tragedy, no wrath of nature, no act of God can defeat the power of love! Presenting the official # kedarnathposter‬, teaser out at 12 noon! 👀🙏❤️ @sushantsinghrajput # ronniescrewvala @gattukapoor @pragyadav @gitspictures @rsvpmovies @zeemusiccompany # kedarnath # jaibholenath # shambhua post shared bysara Ali Khan(@saraalikhan95) onoct 29, 2018 at 12:16pm pdtpilma kaa tiger aane ke baad ab ek or vajah saamne aa rahi he jisaki vajah se is film kii charchaa karnaa jaruri sa ho gaya he
 In this film, the wounds of Indian society are laid on the hand, which, when touched, often leads to pus of unwanted disputes
 bahut arase baad hindi kii lokapriy cinema kii dhara main bhartiya samaaj main ek aisi prem kahani ko dikhaane kaa jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he jisamen hindu ladki (mukku: sara ali khan) kaa prem ek muslim ladke (mansoor: sushant rajput) ke saath he
 In the popular stream, there have been very few such examples of love between Hindu girl and Muslim boy
 jab bhi aisi prem kahaniyaan chuni gayi hai, hamaara nayak us kheme se aata rahaa he, jiskaa daawa he ki wo bharat kaa mul nivasee he
 Whether it was Bombay on the backdrop of the riots in Mumbai after the temple movement, or Sunny Deol's mutiny on the fictional story of the Partition of India and Pakistan
 donon filmon kii nayikaayen muslim hai
 The hero of Bombay is a Brahmin Hindu, while the hero of Ghadar is a Sikh in Indian traditions
 ye parampara bharat main mandir andolan ke baad dharmik khai gahraane se pehle or baad main kaayam rahi hai
 Some critics have also believed that the producers have been showing the stories of Hindu families on the cinema screen in the popular stream only to appease the majority (to bring it to theaters)
 isi vajah se deiring subjects par filmein banane ke liye mashhoor maniratnam bhi bombai main jokhim kii ore nahin badhen
 From Ishqzaade to Anand Rai's "raanjhanaa", there is a long continuation and example of making films in this tradition
 jin filmon ke udhaaharan die hai unki relies ke vakt bhi jis samaaj se nayika aati he, un logon ne film main nayak nayikaon ke filmakan kaa virodh kiya
 However, among these films, the example of Chandraprakash Dwivedi's Pinjar in 2003 is also interesting
 ye film amrutha preetam kii kahani par aadhaarit thi, jisamen bharat pakistan kaa bantwaaraa he
 The film had actors like Manoj Bajpayee, Urmila Matondkar, Sanjay Suri
 is film main bhi muslim nayak or hindu nayika kii kahani he
 In which the Hindu heroine decides to live with the Muslim hero
 is film kaa durbhaagya yah rahaa ki relies ke vakt ise kalatmak shrenee kii film bataa diya gaya, jis vajah se ye hindi cinema ke vyapak darshak varg tak nahin pahunch pai
 However, later TV viewers liked the film and appreciated it
 View this post on instagramsikraka diwas kii bahut shubhakamanaayen @gattukapoor 
 On this day, i want to thank you that you thought it appropriate to take me on this journey of Kedarnath
 is mauqe ke liye, aapke protsaahan ke liye or mere prati aapke dhiraj ke liye main hameshaa aapaki abhaari rahoongi
 🙏🙏🙌🏻🌸🌸 # kedarnath # jaibholenath # shambhua post shared bysara Ali Khan (@ saraalikhan95) onsep 5, 2018 at 1:57 am PDT However, in the last three decades, there have also been stories that have reversed the picture of Hindu boy and Muslim girl
 is
 agar yaad karenge to ek dashak pahaleshahrukh khanor kaajol kii film "maai nem ij khan" kaa udhaaharan milegaa
 Anushka's opposite Aamir Khan's PK also has the presence of a Muslim character
 haalanki upar kii donon filmon ke sandarbh alag hai
 The social milieu of the Muslim hero and Hindu heroine in My Name Is Khan is not entirely Indian
 world trade tower ke baad us audiyans se samvaad kar rahaa he jo america main dharmik pahchaan yaa yun kahen me nasleey pahchaan se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 PK also has a love between a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy, but it is a gourd reference that is shown as a pretext to oppose religious fraud
 yahi vajah he ki prem kahani ke alaava sari chijen focus main hai
 More than the love of the Muslim character with Anushka, the focus is on Jeevam Aamir Khan's feelings towards her
 kedarnath main ye jokhim kyon?kya kedarnath ek aisi film he, jisamen hindi kii popular cinema kii ek parampara todane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The whole story of Kedarnath has not been revealed, but it is clear that this is a hindu-muslim love story amidst the disaster
 sawaal yah he ki "kedarnath" jis tarah kii kahani he kya usamen nayak yaa nayika ke aise jode ko dikhaanaa uchit hota? kya kahani par kuch fark padataa? kya yah vivaad aamantrit karne ke liye hi he
 View this post on Instagram at 1:02 am PDT This may or may not happen
 is baat par bahes hoti rahi he ki filmon ko prachaarit karne ke liye nirmaataaon kii taraf se aise bindu rakhe jate hai, jin par log baat karen or vivaad ho
 There are many examples that films going through controversies have performed well at the ticket window
 isamen kai aisi filmein bhi thim jinke content main wo baat nahin thi ki unhen bampar safalataa mili
 In the entire controversy of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "padmavat", allegations also emerged that all the things were deliberately planned, which later became a sore bone
 ho saktaa he ki aisa ho, lekin moulikta ke lihaaj se dekhen to sachhee ghatana par aadhaarit kahani main nayika ke apojit muslim charitra kaa hona jaruri tha
 The poster and the teaser reveal that Sushant's character is a Muslim who works as a coolie in the shrine
 yah dilachasp tathy bhi he ki vaishno devi, amarnath yaa kedarnath jaise tamaam tirthasthalon par kuli kaa kaam bahutayat muslim samaaj ke log hi karte hai
 According to the story, the hero had to be a Muslim
 to titannic hi he film kaa clymexghatnaon or tiger ke aadhaar par kedarnath main dharmik yatra par ai hindu ladki ko muslim kuli pasand aane lagata he
 The love of the two rises and the boy miraculously saves the Hindu girl during a natural disaster
 haalanki lav jihad vaale daur main is film kii nayika bhi hindu hi rahati he
 According to the subject, it can be said that the climax of the film will be similar to that of Titanic
 bahusankhyak bhaawanaaon kaa jowar box offis par kaamyaab ho, ladki hindu hi rahe, shaayad film main muslim nayak ko maranaa hi padegaa
 Love is a thing to keep in mind

 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani se tarif milane ke baad somvaar ko madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne apni safai di
 He said that Advani praised all the BJP ministers
 shivaraj ne kaha, 'adwani ne modi or raman singh kii bhi tarif kii, main to tisare number par tha
 Narendra Modi and Raman Singh are senior to me
 ' vahiin, bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki laalkrishna adwani ke bayaan ko galat samajha gaya
 When Advani praised Shivraj Singh Chauhan, it is remarkable that Advani compared the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, both of whom were beyond arrogance, while he compared Shivraj to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for development
 Of
 ishaaron hi ishaaron main shivaraj singh chouhan ko modi se behatar bhi bataa daalaa
 Advani had said that Gujarat is already a 'healthy' state and Modi changed it to a 'magnificent' state, but Chauhan and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh were successful in converting the Bimaru states into a developed state
 adwani ne kaha tha, ‘main narendrabhai modi se kahata hum ki gujarat pehle bhi swasth tha
 You have made it great and you deserve to be congratulated for it
 lekin chouhan or chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne jo kiya vah adbhut he
 'opposition and loved ones also attacked after Advani's statement that the Congress ridiculed the BJP saying that there was a' civil war 'in the opposition party on the issue of candidature for the post of PM
 vahiin, endie ke ahm ghatak dal janata dal united kii maanon baanche khil gayi
 JDU openly attacked Advani and attacked Modi

 In reply to a question about the killing of five Indian soldiers on loc, Tharoor said, "though the matter is not related to his ministry, yes, the country has to negotiate with Pakistan keeping national interests in mind
" needed
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham desh se garibi hataanaa chaahate hai, ham desh main gharelu kayakalp par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaahate hai
 We will not be able to achieve this goal if the country is distracted by enmity on our borders
 is vajah se hamen ab bhi pakistan ke saath baatcheet kii jarurat he
 'he said that we should be vigilant not to take any such step which would help the elements affecting peace whether in Pakistan or India or anywhere else in the world

 Had it been made, the soil of the mall would not have been disposed of in the Patna Zoo and in the name of Tejashwi, it would have been worth 115 crores in the New Friends Colony near Delhi If the property had not been made, the lord would never have been trapped

 is tarah kii haar ke baad kabhi-kabhaar aage badhanaa mushkil ho saktaa he, lekin jab aap antarrashtriya str par khel rahe hai, to aapako iske liye rasta nikaalane ke liye jujhna hota he

 He said, i always try to maintain an atmosphere of laughter and joy inside and outside the field
 jab wicket girtaa he, to main gendbaaj yaa kshetrarakshak ke paas daudkar jane vaala pehla khilaadi hota hum
 Small things like running to the bowler on fine leg or third man and bringing his sweater can make a big difference in the team environment
 raina ne kaha, yah cheez failane vaali hoti he, kyonki jab ek khilaadi aisa karnaa shuru karata he, to doosraa bhi aisa hi karata he
 And before you know it, the whole team is full of energy and passion
 is urja ko banane main thodaa samay lagata he - kabhi chaar over, to kabhi-kabhaar 10 over
 He said, to create this kind of environment, one has to lead and extra effort
 har koi apni ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji ke bare main soch rahaa hota he
 Raina said, if i stand there just to focus on my game, then everyone must be getting carried away
 lekin agar main jaakar kisi ko thapthapaaungaa, to jab main kuch acha karuunga, to vah bhi aayega or aisa hi karegaa
 This creates a positive atmosphere in the field, which makes you feel lighter and increases the enthusiasm of everyone around you
 yahi cheez mere haathon main he or pichley 10 saal se main aisa hi kar rahaa hum
 Regarding his preparations against England, Raina said that he has taken 'tips' from Sachin Tendulkar
 unhone kaha, vah (tendulkar) vahaan badminton khilne aae the or arjuna (tendulkar kaa betaa) vahaan net par abhyaas karata tha
 Sachin Paaji came to give him some tips
 main unke paas gaya or maine unase poocha ki england main kya chijen kerani chahie
 Raina said, i talked to him a lot, especially about the mental side
 maine vahaan bikasi par praveen aamare sar ke saath bhi apni ballebaaji ke vibhinn pahaluon par kaam kiya
 Sachin is the only one on all sides at the Eden Gardens

" ’kattar samarthakon ne to apane chehre par tirange se sachin likhaa hua tha
 The audience also includes Tendulkar's wife Anjali and son Arjun who have arrived here exclusively from Mumbai
 toss kii shuruyaat ‘sachin, sachin’ kii gunj ke saath hui lekin jab bharat toss haar gaya or westeindies ne pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya to prashansakon ko niraashaa hui
 Perhaps because of this, half the seats on the 65 thousand capacity Eden Gardens were seen empty
 lagata he ki toss kii khabar sunne ke baad adhiktar prashaskon ne pehle din ke khel se khud ko dur rakhaa kyonki vah apane chahete cricketer ko aakhri baar ballebaaji karte hue dekhne kaa mauka nahin chuknaa chaahate hai

 bharat ne srilanka ke saamne 322 ran kaa mushkil lakshya rakhaa lekin srilankai team ne use teen wicket khokar aasaani se hasil kar liya
 Kohli said in a press conference after the match on Friday night, 'my personal opinion is that we had scored enough and i also believe that our bowlers bowled well
 agar srilankai ballebaaj is tarah kii ballebaaji karte hai or har koi acha khel dikhaata he to aapako virdohi team ko shrey dena hoga
 We are not invincible
 ' He said, 'we are playing against those teams which are the champion teams themselves
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane acchhee gendbaaji kii
 Here you have to give credit to the other team
 ’ kohli ne kaha ki apane saathiyon kii aalochana karne ke bajaay vah srilankai ballebaajon ke shandaar pradarshan ke liye unki saraahna karnaa chahenge
 He said, 'if a team plays cricket with such mentality and presents a good sample of their shot, then you have to praise them and say that they played very well
 ’ maujuuda champion bharat ab karo yaa maro vaali sthiti main aa gaya he or dakshin africa ke khilaaf hone vaala match ab vaastavik quarter final ban gaya he jisamen jeet darj karne vaali team semifinal main jagah banaaegi

 There are two points and if you win your next match then you will move forward, which in my view is an interesting situation for all teams

 ) unhone kaha, ‘ham un tiimon ke khilaaf khel rahe hai jo ki khud champion timen hai
 i think we bowled well
 yahaan aapako duusari team ko shrey dena hoga
 Kohli said that instead of criticizing his teammates, he would like to praise Sri Lankan batsmen for their great performance
 unhone kaha, ‘agar koi team is tarah kii maansikta se cricket khelti he or apane shaat kaa acha namoona pesh karti he to aapako unki prashansa kerani padegi or kahana hoga ki bahut acha khele
 'defending champion India has now come into a do-or-die situation and the match against South Africa has now become a real quarter-final in which the winning team will advance to the semi-finals
 tippaniyan Kohli said, 'yes, it has become very exciting
 ab asal main har match quarter final ban gaya he
 Especially two from each team in our group
 do ank hai or agar aap apana aglaa match jeet jate ho to aage bad jaaoge jo ki meri najar main sabhi tiimon ke liye rochak sthiti he

 ) Indian national Sarabjit Singh, who was sentenced to be hanged in a Pakistani jail, filed his mercy petition with President Asif Ali Zardari for the fifth time on May 29
 yachika main sarbajit ne kaha he, ''main ek aise aparaadh ke liye 22 saal jail main bitaa chukaa hum jo maine nahin kiya
 Sarabjit, 49, was sentenced to death for his involvement in the 1990 bombings in Lahore
 ek lakh logon ne is yachika par dastakhat kiye hai, jisamen jaradaari se maanviya aadhaar par sarbajit ko reeha karne kii apil kii gai he
 The petition also lists letters to Zardari of two distinguished Indian Muslim personalities - Maulana Ahmed Bukhari, the royal imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, and Syed Mohammad Yamin Hashmi, the patron of the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer
 bukhari ne apane patr main likhaa he, ''sarbajit kii rihaai donon mulkon ke bich sadichha or sampradayik sadbhaav failaane kaa kaam karegi
 a few days before Sarabjit's plea, the Supreme Court of India gave a decision to release 82-year-old Khalil Chishti, a Pakistani microbiologist jailed in Ajmer on humanitarian grounds
 jaradaari ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko april main ek khat likhaa tha, jiske baad chishti ko jamaanat de di gai
 Earlier high level diplomatic talks also took place
 bhartiya press parishad ke adhyaksh markandeya katju ne bhi sarbajit ko chhodane ke liye jaradaari se teen baar apil kii, lekin ab tak iskaa jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Katju also wrote to former Pakistani senator Syed Fasih Iqbal in this context and asked him to take Sarabjit's case in hand
 ikbaal ne unhen 27 may ko bharosa dilaayaa ki ve logon kii raishumaari karne kii koshish karenge
 Amidst the new voices coming out in support of Sarabjit from both sides of the border, it will have to be seen whether Zardari pays for the release of India's Chishti by releasing Sarabjit
