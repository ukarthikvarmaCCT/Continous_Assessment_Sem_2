 Sonali Phogat is on a tic-talk, quite famously, to beat through politics: BJP, Janata Nayak Party and Indian National Lok Dal candidates in many seats in Haryana assembly elections
 bijepi ne bhajanlaal parivaar or philhal congress main shaamil kuldeep bishnoi ke garh adampur se tik tok queen kahe jane vaali purv tivi abhinetri sonaali phogot ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Sonali Phogat is quite famous on Tick Talk
 jaise hi bijepi ne unhen adampur se apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya vaise hi tik tok par unke hindi filmi geeton par banaae gaye video viral ho gaye
 While some trolled Sonali Phogat on social media, many people started writing different things about her video
 '12 saal se raajnneeti main hum active'vahiin in sab baton kaa sonaali phogot par koi asar dikhaai nahin de rahaa he
 Adampur SEJP candidate Sonali Phogatne said, 'as soon as BJP announced the ticket in my name, i came to know that videos of my tick talk are being made viral on social media
 main pichley 12 saal se raajnneeti main active hum lekin acting meraa profeshan he or main acting ke apane is profeshan ko kabhi nahin chhod sakati
 This is why i fulfill my hobby through Tick Talk
 'aage sonaali phogot ne kaha, 'mere tik tok video ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten kahi ja rahi hai lekin maine apane in video main apana acting kaa shauk to jarur puraa kiya he lekin kabhi bhi apni sabhyataa or maryaada ko nahin laangha he
 Sonali Phogat also attacked Kuldeep Bishnoi with sharp attack on Congress candidate Kuldeep Bishnoi and said, "for the last nearly 50 years, Bhajanlal and his family have dominated the Adampur seat
 mujhe lagata he ki bhajanlaal ne jarur achche kaam kiye the lekin ab kuldeep vishnoi bhajanlaal ke naam par adampur kii janata ko bargala kar or imotional blackmel karke unke vot hasil kar lete hai
 Further, Phogat said, 'kuldeep Bishnoi who calls me an outsider does not himself live in his constituency
 ve bijnesaman hai
 He stays abroad for his business most of the time while i am from Adampur
 meraa janm adampur main hua tha
 i have property in Adampur and i live more in Adampur
 'sonaali phogot ne kaha, 'agar main vidhayak bani to uske baad bhi apane acting profeshan ko jari rakhuungi or apane tik tok ke video bhi banaati rahuungi lekin us vakt ke video filmi geeton kii bajaay yuvaaon ke liye sandesh dene vaale zyada honge
 At the same time it is also true that i will not leave my acting profession
 'unhone kaha, 'main pehle actor hum or phir uske baad raajnneeti main ai hum
 For this reason, i will continue my acting profession along with politics
 jis tarah se mere bare main puraa hisar or adampur ke log jaanate hai mere paas kya sampatti he uski sabko jaankaree he kitni jameen he
 Kuldeep Bishnoi's counterattack Congress candidate Kuldeep Bishnoi from Adampur also hit back at Sonali Phogat, saying, "you can make a fan with Tick Talk's video but it doesn't mean that they will turn into fan votes too
" vot hasil karne ke liye kaam karnaa padataa he
 He also said, 'bhajanlal family has worked continuously in the field
 mere pita ne jo kaam kiye the or maine is ilaake ke liye jo kaam kiye hai usee ke aadhaar par janata kaa vishwaas hamaare parivaar par he
 The people here have been continuously winning our family
 'kuldeep bishnoi ne kaha, 'sonaali phogot to is ilaake kii jarur he par phir bhi yahaan ke kai gaanvon ke logon ko naam tak pataa nahin honge
 On the viral videos of Sonali, Kuldeep Bishnoi said, 'I have told my activists not to write anything vulgar about viral videos of Sonali Phogat
 wo unki personal life he or hamen har kisi kii personal life kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or hamen agar unhen haraana he to ham chunaav main raajnneeti ke jariye haraayenge
 "what do the people of Adampur have to say? However, when the Aaj Tak team spoke to the people present in Adampur to know the ground reality of Adampur, people praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's work
 vahiin bijepi ummidavaar sonaali phogot ko lekar kaha, 'bhale hi soshal media par unke video kaaphi popular ho lekin adampur ke liye wo parachute candidet kii tarah hai
 People say that the BJP has chosen the wrong candidate to contest the Congress in a seat like Adampur and a local BJP leader should have been nominated as the candidate
 logon ne kaha ki unki naaraazgi kuldeep bishnoi se jarur he lekin sonaali phogot ke unke saamne utaarne par lag rahaa he ki kuldeep bishnoi ko phayda milegaa
 At the same time, many people say that they have seen videos of Sonali Phogat on social media, but they do not know anything other than these videos about Sonali Phogat
 kiske haath lagegi jeet?kul milakar adampur ek aisi seat he
 Where the BJP wants to make saffron riots in any way, but seeing the way Sonali Phogat has been put forward, it seems that Sonali Phogat has been labeled a parachute candidate
 vaise bhi sonaali bijepi kii tikat par hisar ke hi nalava vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav ladanaa chaahati thi lekin party ne vahaan se tikat nahin diya or adampur bhej diya
 Now, after the counting of votes on October 24, it will be clear whether Sonali Phogat's famous face and his viral videos turn into votes

 org sandip kumaar sex scandle main ghiri aam aadmi party par puraane saathi bhi jamkar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Twitter became a battleground on Tuesday evening, where Prashant Bhushan and AAP spokesperson Ashutosh were seen clashing
 bhushan ne twit kar 2015 kii neshnal council kii baithak kaa zikr kiya or likhaa ki ummidavaaron par sawaal uthaane par arvind kejariwal ek taraf hamen gaali de rahe the to duusari taraf aseem, sandip or tomars ko hira bataa rahe the
 Ashutosh hit back at Prashant Bhushan by writing a blog within just 3 minutes of this tweet, and asked Ashutoshne Bhushan to reply to the tweet from the tweet- 'sir, have you not yet replied if you supported Sandeep's candidacy in 2013? In the AAP Sandeep Kumar sex scandal on the defensive, the Aam Aadmi Party has got badly involved
 musiibat tab bad gai, jab anna hajaare ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se naaraazgi jataai or party main shaamil logon ke aacharan par aitraaj kiya

 dilip pandey bole- anna kaa bayaan hamaare liye aashirvapanna hajaare kii tippaneeper jab aaj tak ne aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa dilip pandey se sawaal poocha to unhone kaha, 'anna ji hamaare pita baraabar hai
 Whenever Anna ji's instructions have been received, we have followed him
 hamaara kad itnaa bada nahin he ki unke upar tippanee kar saken
 His sorrow, his commentary is a blessing to us
 'in aap's National Council meeting of April 15,while abusing us for questioning his candidates,ak called Tomar, asim&sandeep as his diamonds!— Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1)september 6, 2016aam aadmi party daawa karti he ki wo apane kisi bhi ummidavaar kii pukhta jaanch karne ke baad hi use party kaa hissaa banaati he
 But recently many such cases have come to the fore, which expose these claims

 lekin ham maanate hai ki ye aakhri satya nahin he

 'sens of humar dilaataa he raahatvidya baalan kaa kahana he ki aamtaur par vah afvaahon par dhyaan nahin deteen, lekin kabhi-kabhi yah pareshaan karne vaala hota he
 Vidya says that at such a time, her sense of humor saves her from trouble
 vah kahati hai, 'ek actress or public figure hone ke naate maine yah sweekaar kar liya he ki log nijee jindagi main ghuspaith karnaa chahenge
 i know that people are interested in it and keep guessing

 Speaking on Ramnavmi vs Moharram, Babul said that BJP has not brought Ramnavmi to West Bengal
 bijepi kaa janm pashchim bengal main nahin hua he
 Ramnavmi has been chosen by the people of the state herself
 babul ne kaha ki moharram main ham sochate the ki kaise koi chaabuk se khud ko itnaa jakhmi kar saktaa he
 He said that whenever i could see me, Maulana used to take my eyes off him
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki unke bare main problem mekar hone kii dharna puri tarah se galat he
 Babul said that at the time of the Raniganj riots he did not want to sit in the room locked
 baahar mamata sampradayik maahaul kharaab kar rahi thi or unke liye ghar se baahar nikalnaa behad jaruri tha
 Babul said that he did not come to the place after the riots but came earlier but the police were sitting in another area drinking tea
 babul ne kaha ki bengal main vah trinmul congress se nahin balki barabari ke liye ladaai lard rahe hai
 Babul Supriyo said that since the panchayat elections, Mamata is upset and she is ready to do anything to stop the opposition
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki bengal main hinsa kii sthiti ko puraa desh dekh rahaa he lekin aisa kyon he ki pashchim bengal main kabhi tear gas or water canan jaisi chizon kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 Babylon claimed that the state government first gives the rebels complete freedom and when they incite riots and arson, they are given an hour to flee from the spot
 iske baad hi rajya main police kisi vaardaat kii jagah par pahunchati he
 Speaking on the violence, Babul said that the BJP does not have the muscle power to fight these forces of the state
 lekin rajya kii janata ab in takaton ko samaj rahi he or inke khilaaf under karant he or vah khud inaki hinsa kaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar he
 Babul said that crude bombs are supplied from tmc's office in place of riots
 rajya main sarkaar ne is tarah se chizon ko apane hisaab se chalaane kaa formula bana rakhaa he or police ko kabhi nyaay ke liye khadaa hone nahin diya jaataa
 Babul Supriyo said that Mamta Banerjee has done the work of misusing the power of the government
 babul ne kaha ki mamata didi bhale saamaanya jivan jiti hai lekin vah aisi chizon ko apane aasapaas badhane de rahi he
 She wears simple slippers and a blue sari but follows the path of violence
 pashchim bengal se adhik hinsa upi or bihar main he aisa home ministry kaa aankada kahata he
 Babul said that the home ministry in the state is the subject of the state and why in Bengal the state government will give data to the center that violence is happening there

 Among the things that could be seen was a hydraulic lift, with the help of which Akhilesh Yadav can be elevated, and he will be able to address the public by staying in this bus during road shows and rallies
 
 
 'samaajawaadee vikaas rath' main sisitivi camere, alsidi television, sofaset or bistar bhi maujuud he
 
 
 a promotional song designed for development also plays on a loudspeaker mounted on the bus
 
 
 laal rang kii yah chamakdaar bas kiskaa prachaar kar rahi he, ise lekar kisi andeh kii gunjaaish na chhodte hue bas kii said main mukhyamantri kii badi-si tasviir lagi hui he, jisamen vah cycle par savaar dikh rahe hai, jo unki samaajawaadee party kaa chunaav chihn he, or bas ke saamne ke hisse main bhi cycle bani hui he
 
 
 Two photographs of Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister's father and the head of the Samajwadi Party, are positioned in the back of the bus, while Shivpal Yadav, the party's state unit chief and Akhilesh Yadav's uncle, has no place in the 'samajwadi Vikas Rath' Have been found 
 
 gauratlab he ki pichley kaaphi samay se akhilesh yadav tathaa unke chachaa shivpal yadav ke bich party main zordaar 'satta sangharsh' jari he, jisaki vajah se mukhyamantri ne apane pita se bhi duuri bana lee, kyonki mulaayam singh ne lagaataar apane bhai kaa saath diya
 
 
 But forgetting all differences, Akhilesh Yadav will return to Lucknow on Saturday, and attend the party's silver jubilee celebrations to be chaired by father Mulayam Singh Yadav
 
 
 mukhyamantri kah chuke hai ki vah apane boote prachaar kar rahe hai, jabaki unke pita bhi yah kah chuke hai ki yadi aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main unki party jeet jaati he, to akhilesh yadav ko hi mukhyamantri ke rup main doosraa kaarykaal milegaa, yah nishchit nahin he
 
 
 The comments vaise, is laal bas ko dekhne se bhi saaf he ki mukhyamantri ke prachaar abhiyaan kaa focus kis ore he
 
 
 The flagship schemes launched by the Akhilesh Yadav government have been given prominence on the bus sides, including the Lucknow Metro, the government ambulance service and the ambitious dole-a-coop-help schemes launched shortly before
 
 
 udhar, congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne haal hi main uttar pradesh kaa chah saptaah kaa daura puraa kiya he, jiske dauraan unhone esayuvi (kabhi-kabhi bas main bhi) main safar kiya
 
 
 Leaving no scope for any doubt about who is promoting this bright red bus, a big picture of the Chief Minister is seen on the side of the bus, in which he is seen riding a bicycle, which is the election of his Samajwadi Party
 There is a sign, and the bicycle also remains in the front of the bus
 
 
 mukhyamantri ke pita or samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav kii do tasveeron ko bas ke peeche ke hisse main sthaan diya gaya he, jabaki party kii rajya ikai ke pramukh va akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav ko 'samaajawaadee vikaas rath' main koi jagah nahin mil pai he
 
 
 It is worth mentioning that for a long time, there has been a strong 'power struggle' between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav in the party, due to which the Chief Minister also kept distance from his father, as Mulayam Singh continuously supported his brother
 
 
 lekin sabhi matbhedon ko bhulaakar akhilesh yadav shanivaar ko lakhanu lautenge, or pita mulaayam singh yadav kii adhyakshata main hone vaale party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main shirkat karenge
 
 
 The Chief Minister has said that he is campaigning on his own, while his father has also said that if his party wins in the upcoming assembly elections, it is not certain that Akhilesh Yadav will get a second term as Chief Minister

 kya team india ke vartmaan captain viraat kohli vanade or test main sarvaadhik ran or shatakon ke sachin tendulkar ke record ko dhwast kar denge? australian diggaj cricketer glen magra ne ek baar phir is bahes ko hawa de di he
 He measured the weight of these two Indian batsmen and sought to put a stop to speculation, saying that current Indian Test captain Virat Kohli can match the feats of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar on the cricket field
 sachin se tulana karnaa khudviratako nahin bhaataa kyonki wo unhen bahut sammaan dete hai
 Virat even said that he feels embarrassed when compared to Sachin
 lekin viraat aap jis tarah se batting kar rahe hai yah tulana to kamobesh chalati hi rahegi
 We looked at the current records of Virat Kohli and the records of then Sachin Tendulkar and the results we got are startling
 mjedaar to yah he ki viraat kohli ke ran banane kii gati us trek par he jisase wo master blaster se bhi kahin adhik teji se unke test or vanade records ko dhwast kar denge
 One thing to be noted here is that Sachin has played only one T20 International while 135
 57 ke strike rate se 45 maichon main 1,658 ran bana chuke viraat is formet ke betajbadshaah hai
 57 of Virat in T20
 17 ranon kii ausat ek hajaar se adhik ran bana chuke vartmaan ke kisi bhi cricketer se kahin adhik he
 In odis, Virat is on Virat, the heavy white ball is more pleasing to Virat
 yah ham nahin vanade cricket main viraat ke aankade bol rahe hai
 Virat, who played 171 matches, averaged 51 here
 51 kaa he
 So far, he has reached triple digits during 25 innings
 is dauraan unhone 7,212 ran banaae hai
 Now, if Sachin Tendulkar's figures are seen at this stage, then he is behind Koso with Virat
 itane hi vanade khilne tak sachin tendulkar ne viraat kii tulana main aadhe se bhi kam yani keval 12 shatak or 38
 He scored just 5,828 runs at an average of 85
 haalanki iske baad sachin tendulkar ne 292 vanade or khelte hue apane vanade maichon kii sankhya 463 par pahunchaa di or ritair hone tak 44
 Total 18,426 runs at an average of 83
 sachin ne apane vanade kariyar ke dauraan kul 49 shatak lagaae
 If Virat continues to play at the same pace, he will surely break Sachin Tendulkar's record before playing as many matches as him
 kam se kam 63 vanade centuri maarenge viramb sawaal yah uthta he ki viraat jis gati se ran bana rahe hai usase wo apane kariyar ke dauraan kitna shatak jad sakate hai? ham saamaanya guna bhaag karne se is nattejey par pahunche hai ki viraat kohli agar sachin ke baraabar bhi vanade match khelte hai to 63 shatakon ke saath 19,527 ran kaa pahaad khadaa karenge
 Now, if like Sachin, his bat starts hitting more runs from here, then at what height this record will reach, it is difficult to say
 test main sachin se better hai viratcricket ke lambey formet main sachin tendulkar ne 51 shatak lagaae lekin iske liye unhone 200 test bhi khele
 If we look at the current record of Virat Kohli, he has surpassed Sachin at this stage
 abhi tak viraat ne 45 test maichon main 3,245 ran banaae hai
 Their average is 45
 06 kaa he or wo 12 test shatak bhi thonk chuke hai
 While playing the same test, Sachin scored 3,087 runs with 10 centuries less than Virat
 beshak sachin 50
 He was ahead of Virat with an average of 60 runs
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki antarrashtriya cricket main 100 shatakon ke saath sachin cricket ke ol time great players main se ek hai lekin cricket ke maidan par bade se bada record dhwast hote ham dekhte hi rahete hai or jis aatmavishvaas or thaath ke saath viraat cricket kii pich par bade se bade gendbaajon ko bouna sabit kar rahe hai use or little jeniyas se kiye gaye unke uparokt tulanaatmak adhyayan ko dekhte hue yah kahana mushkil nahin he ki wo apane master se do kadam aage nikal jaaenge
 At the moment, it is time to see and enjoy Virat's amazing batting and his amazing decisions while captaining Team India

 In whose name, not only the public but also the police and the leaders started trembling
 akhabaaron ke panne har roj usee kii surkhiyon se range hote the
 We are talking about Sriprakash Shukla, the most dangerous mafia don of UP
 jisane desh ke sabase bade soobe main kaayam kar diya tha aatank kaa raaj
 Who is Sriprakash Shuklashriprakash Shukla was born in Mamkhor village of Gorakhpur
 uske pita ek skool main shikshak the
 He used to be a famous wrestler of his village
 saal 1993 main shriprakash shukla ne uski bahan ko dekhakar siti bajaane vaale rakesh tiwari naamak ek vyakti kii hatya kar di thi
 This was the first crime in the life of a 20-year-old Sriprakash
 iske baad usne palat kar nahin dekha or wo jaraayam kii duniya main aage badhata chalaa gaya
 Shukla had fled to Bangkok, after killing Rakesh in his village, the police was searching for Shukla
 maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhate hue shriprakash ne desh chhodana hi behatar samajha
 And somehow he ran away to Bangkok
 vah kaaphi dinon tak vahaan rahaa lekin jab vah laut kar aayaa to usne aparaadh kii duniya main hi thikaana banane kaa man bana liya tha
 Surajbhan had joined the gang Sriprakash Shriprakash Shukla was wanted in the murder case
 police yahaan uski talash kar rahi thi or vah bangkok main khule aam gum rahaa tha
 But due to the lack of money, he could not stay there for long
 or vah bharat laut aayaa
 After coming, he moved to Mokama, Bihar and joined Surajbhan Gang of the state
 shahi kii hatya se uchhla nambahubali banakar shriprakash shukla ab jurm kii duniya main naam kama rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, in 1997, he killed the politician and notorious criminal Virendra Shahi in Lucknow
 mana jaataa he ki shahi ke virdohi hari shankar tiwari kare ishaare par yah sab hua tha
 He wanted to contest from Chillupar assembly seat
 iske baad ek ek karke na jane kitne hi hatya, apharan, avaidh vasuuli or dhamkee ke maamle shriprakash shukla ke naam likhe gaye
 Bahubali: The unheard story of this criminal-turned-politician-turned-politician was on railway contracts
 An umbrella Rajshriprakash Shukla was out of reach of the police
 uskaa naam usase bhi bada banataa ja rahaa tha
 The UP police was shocked
 naam pataa tha lekin uski koi tasviir police ke paas nahin thi
 Extortion from traders, kidnapping, murder, robbery, unrestrained rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bas yahi uskaa pesha tha
 And whoever came between it did not delay at all to kill him
 lihaaja log to log police tak usase darati thi
 STF Sriprakash's blatant crimes were made to catch Shukla had become a headache for the government and police
 sarkaar ne uske khatme kaa man bana liya tha
 There was a meeting of the Chief Minister of UP, the Home Minister and the DGP at the Lucknow Secretariat
 isamen aparaadhiyon se nipatane ke liye special force banane kii yojana taiyaar hui
 On May 4, 1998, the then ADG of UP Police, Ajayraj Sharma, sorted out the best 50 personnel of the state police and formed Special Task Force (STF)
 is force kaa pehla task tha- shriprakash shukla, jinda yaa murda
 The first encounter with the police was on 9 September 1997, the first police encounter with Sriprakash
 police ko khabar mili ki shriprakash apane teen saathiyon ke saath salon main bal katwane lakhanu ke janpath market main aane vaala tha
 Police laid siege all around
 lekin yah oparation naa sirf fail ho gaya balki police kaa ek jawan bhi shahid ho gaya
 After this encounter Sriprakash Shukla's panic increased all over UP
 bahubalihis anderworld don ke naam se aaj bhi kaanpata he bollywoodmushkil se police ko mili thi tasvirsaadi vardi main tainaat eke 47 se las estf ke javaanon ne lakhanu se gajiabad, gajiabad se bihar, kalakatta, jaipur tak chhapemari tab jaakar shriprakash shukla kii tasviir police ke haath lagi
 Here, the STF was searching for Sriprakash and on the other hand, Sriprakash Shukla had reached Patna to carry out the biggest crime of his career
 patna main kiya tha mantri kaa murdershriprakash shukla ne 13 june 1998 ko patna sthit indira gandhi hospital ke baahar bihar sarkaar ke tatkaaleen mantri brij bihari prasad kii goli markar hatya kar di
 The minister was killed when security guards were present with him
 wo apni laal batti kii car se utre hi the ki eke 47 se las 4 badmaashon ne unpar firing shuru kar di or vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 With the Chief Minister's Supervisory murder, Shri Prakash had made it clear that he now has a umbrella rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bihar ke mantri ke katl kaa maamla abhi thanda bhi nahin hua tha ki tabhi upi police ko ek aisi khabar mili jisase police ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 Sriprakash Shukla took the betel nut of the then Chief Minister of UP Kalyan Singh
 6 karod rupee main siem kii supaari lene kii khabar estf ke liye bam girane jaisi thi
 The use of mobile surveillance STF came into action and he also decided that now it is necessary to catch Sriprakash Shukla under any circumstances
 estf ko pataa chalaa ki shriprakash dilli main apni kisi garlfriend se mobile par baaten karata he
 STF took her mobile on surveillance
 lekin shriprakash ko shaq ho gaya
 He started talking to pcos instead of mobile
 lekin use yah nahin pataa tha ki police ne uski garlfriend ke number ko bhi servilans par rakhaa he
 Surveillance revealed that the PCO from whom Sriprakash is calling is in Indirapuram area of ghaziabad
 khabar milte hi upi estf kii team fouran lokation kii taraf ravaanaa ho jaati he
 Such was killed Sriprakash Shukla On 23 September 1998, the in-charge of STF, Arun Kumar, gets the news that Shriprakash Shukla is coming from Delhi towards Ghaziabad
 shriprakash shukla kii car jaise hi vasundhara inkalev paar karti he, arun kumaar sahit estf kii team uskaa peechha shuru kar detii he

 uski car jaise hi indirapuram ke sunsaan ilaake main daakhil hui, mauka milte hi estf kii team ne achaanak shriprakash kii car ko overtek kar uskaa rasta roak diya
 The police first asked Sriprakash to surrender but he did not agree and started firing
 police kii javaabi firing main shriprakash shukla maaraa gaya
 And thus ended the story of up's biggest don

 apni eemaandaaree or bebaaki ke liye jane jane vaale haryana ke varisht iees adhikari ashok khemka ek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 a few days ago, Ashok Khemka, who had told the Khattar government minister Krishna Bedi about the misuse of the vehicle, has now questioned the decision of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's office without any fear that the Chief Minister's personal staff will be asked for Diwali
 On the spot, there has been talk of giving an honorarium equal to one month's salary
 mukhyamantri or rajya ke mukhya sachiv ko likhe patr main ashok khemka ne mukhyamantri ke nijee staff ko diwaali ke maukey par die ja rahe is nakad tohfe par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Describing this cash gift of the government as unnecessary, Ashok Khemka has cited Rule 50 of Chapter 5 of the Haryana Civil Service, saying that the government employees get the honorarium only for doing very special work and the limit is only up to 10 thousand rupees
 it occurs
 lekin diwaali ke maukey paramanohar laal khatterne apane nijee staff ke liye sarkari khajaane khol die hai
 According to sources, the private staff of 181 people of the Chief Minister has been directed to pay an honorarium equal to one month's salary
 kuch logon ko to ₹7 xxrep 4 0 tark die ja rahe hai, jo niyamon ke khilaaf he
 Ashok Khemka has slammed his own government, saying that the honorarium being given in the name of Diwali is not only against the rules but is also being given to a particular section of the employees who are on deputation
 jin karmchaariyon ko hajaaron rupye kaa nakad diwali tohfa diya ja rahaa he unamem zyaadaatar log mukhyamantri offis, mukhyamantri awaas or mukhyamantri kii suraksha main tainaat hai
 a few days ago, Ashok Khemka had heard Khattar cabinet minister Krishna Bedi being unabashed over the misuse of a jeep of his department throughout the year and taught him the lesson of honesty
 mantri mahoday ne agle hi roj us jeep ko vibhaag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 Now it remains to be seen whether the Chief Minister withdraws the decision of giving an honorarium of thousands of rupees to his personal staff

 jisamen ek ore pakistan or kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se baatcheet kii majaburi he to duusari ore rajya ke tanaavpurn halaat
 Whose fault is there in this manhunt? Some unresolved questions remain - is India responsible for bringing peace in Pakistan and Kashmir? Terrorism is its root
 pakistan main palaa-badha
 There has been trouble in Kashmir and now in Pakistan itself
 pakistan main bam dhamaakaa hota he, to uski sajeesh kisi videshi dharti par rachi gai nahin hoti
 Terrorists leave his house and are shown their work there

 mana ja rahaa he ki kanpur se murali manohar joshi kaa tikat bijepi se lagbhag cat gaya he or vah bhi adwani kii tarah hi is baar chunavi akhaade main nahin dikhenge
 If close sources are to be believed, Murali Manohar Joshi is not as hurt by the information about his ticket being cut, but the way he is transported
 murali manohar joshi kaa kahana he ki agar unke tikat kaate jane kaa faisla bijepi adhyaksh amit shah khud bataane aate to unhen acha lagata

 It is believed that Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi are being ignored in BJP due to increasing age

 On 14 June 2016, Ramnivas Goyal while talking to NDTV claimed that 'I have allotted these rooms and it is the right of the Speaker to do so

 Because the notification under which 21 parliamentary secretaries were made in March 2015 clearly stated that the parliamentary secretary will get a place to work in the office of the minister with whom the parliamentary secretary will be connected, but the government's request for room in the assembly It means that Parliamentary Secretaries were asked to provide separate rooms, as well as giving furniture means that it will also cost money

 The bjp's ally Shiv Sena has once again targeted the BJP
 shivasena ne bijepi par nayaa aarope dohari niti apnaane kaa lagaaya he
 The Shiv Sena criticized some sections of the BJP targeting actor Shah Rukh Khan for making statements about 'gross intolerance' in the country, saying that telling the actor to 'go to Pakistan' revealed the party's 'double policy'
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main chape sampadakeey main kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke sadsy or mukhyamantri (devendra fadanvis) ne gulam ali ko puri suraksha ke bich rajya main prastuti dene ke liye nimantran diya tha
 In this way you invite one side and on the other hand you ask Shahrukh Khan to go to Pakistan
 is samay dohari niti apanaai ja rahi he
 Shahrukh is an artist and it is not right to target him simply because he is a Muslim
 ’sampadakeey main aage kaha gaya he ki bollywood superstar kii tippanee ko lekar uthe vivaad ne un logon ke chehron se mukhauta utaar diya he jo gulam ali ke sangeet kaarykram or pakistan ke purv mantri khurshid mahmud kasuri ke mumbai main pustak vimochan ke khilaaf shivasena ke virodh ko lekar uski aalochana kar rahe the

" jin logon ne kaha tha ki gulam ali or khurshid ke mudde ko lekar bharat kii pratishtha ko thes pahunchi he, unke mukhute shahrukh prakaran ke baad utar gaye hai
 In fact, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiyaan created controversy through a tweet on Tuesday
 unhone apane twit main kaha tha ki shahrukh rahete to bharat main hai lekin unki ‘aatma’ pakistan main he
 a day before his comment, Shah Rukh had said that there is "gross intolerance" in the country
 apni tippaniyon ke kaaran nishane par aane ke baad vijayawargeey ne apane vivaadaaspad twit waapas le liye the lekin unhone is baat par jor diya tha ki yadi bharat main ashishnutaa hoti to amitabh bachchan ke baad shahrukh sabase lokapriy abhinayta na hote
 On Wednesday, bjp's controversial MP Yogi Adityanath compared Shah Rukh with the mastermind of the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks and Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed, advising the actor to move to Pakistan
 isi bich shivasena ne kaha ki vah pakistan ke saath saamaajik, saanskrithik evam raajnneetik rishton kaa virodh tab tak jari rakhegi, jab tak padosi desh apni harkaton se baj nahin aa jaataa
 The Shiv Sena said that what the party is doing is actually an expression of people's feelings
 shivasena ne kaha, ‘gulam ali kehete hai ki vah tab tak bharat nahin aaenge jab tak ki donon deshon ke rishte sudhar nahin jate
 We appreciate his stand and hope that he will persevere with his stand
 is bich vah ek shantidoot kii bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai or hafiz said evam un anya aatankiyon ko badalane kii koshish kar sakate hai, jo pakistan main baithe hai or bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugal rahe hai

 The government's ally is also with him on this issue, then the opposition BJP is also openly saying that Telangana should be formed
 yani sansad main ise lekar koi dikkat nahi dikhti

 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Reddy himself has said that he does not want to divide the state
 unke saath saath kendra ke mantri pallam raju or di purandeshwari bhi bantwaaraa hone par istife kii dhamkee de chuke he
 The problem is with Hyderabad as to who to support

 (input language) ek shahar se duusare shahar jaakar rahanaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 Memories of the place where you are aware of each street, do not let you live a moment in peace in the new city
 iske alaava nae shahar ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal paanaa bhi aasaan nahin hota he
 Especially during the time when you come to the city to work or study
 aise main sangharsh or zyada bad jaataa he
 If you are going from one city to another, especially from a small city to a metro, then these problems may come to you: 1
 kya lekar jaaen saathpareshaani kii shuruyaat packing se hoti he
 When you start leaving the house, you feel that it is not easy to pack the items you need in two-three bags
 aap baar-baar saamaan nikaalte or phir dobaaraa se rakhte hai
 At that time it seems necessary to keep everything, but it is not possible to carry it all together
 2
 Where to Find Home Another problem is to find a house in a new city
 chote shaharon main bade ghar main rahane kii aadat hoti he
 At the same time, you have to live in a room in Metro City
 kisi rummet ke saath cameraa bhi share karnaa hota he
 Not only this, if you live in PG then there is no end to problems
 aap nae shahar main har samay ek achche or saste ghar kii talash main hi lage rahete hai
 3
 nae dost dhundne menghar ke baad baari aati he doston kii
 Making friends in a new city is not an easy task because someone here knows about you
 collejon main to phir bhi jald dost ban jaaenge
 But if you come to work then it is difficult to make friends
 agar aap khushkismat hue or aapaki dosti kisi se ho gai he to kitne din chal paaegi, isaki bhi koi guarantee nahin hoti
 4
 anjaani jagah kaa bhatkavane shahar main ek saptaah tak to aapkaa dimag khaali-sa ho jaataa he
 That is, you do not understand what is happening
 5
 If you are fond of eating, then the difficulty in your new city increases rather than decreases
 aap shahar ke aise jagahon kii talash karne lagate hai jahaan aapke pasand kii khaane-pine kii chijen milti hon
 6
 tahjeeb kaa farkachote shahar se aane vaale logon ko bade shaharon main aakar cultural shock (saanskrithik) bhi lagata he
 Every city has its own culture and adjusting to a new environment is not easy for everyone
 7
 In the labyrinth of roads, your time is often spent in finding the way
 maan lijie aap dilli aae hai to aapako metro steshnon kaa master hona padegaa
 If you are in Mumbai, then local will be your lifeline
 is life line ko samajhe bina aapkaa kaam nahin chalane vaala
 8
 ghar kii yadjise hi aap shahar kaa chakkar lagaakar raat ko shanti se apane bistar tak aate hai, ghar kii yaad sataana shuru kar detii he
 Repeatedly call parents and their friends
 jahaan pehle aapke phone main miss kol dene ke liye bhi paise nahin hote the vahaan ab aap richarge par richarge karwaane lagate hai
 9
 har kaam khud karnaa padataa haijab aap kisi shahar main akele hote hai to apane saamaanon se lekar baaki kai tarah kii jimmedaariyaan bhi aap ke kandhon par hoti hai
 Being alone makes you self-reliant
 shuru main bhale hi yah takalifdeh ho lekin yah aapke jivan ke liye phydemand sabit hota he
 10
 nai bhashaa ko apnaanaa padataa haine shahar main aapako vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi do-chaar hona padataa he
 Especially the short forms of phrases, such as TTYL (talk to you letter), picture (pics), NSFW (not safe for work), JFF ie (just for fun), the person being held captive and listening to such new words and Knowing what they mean is a new experience
 11

 When i said that i had to go to campus, he asked for an I-card
 jab maine kaha ki main yahaan kaa student nahin hum to unhone meraa auto vahiin se waapas lautaa diya
 Moving from there in compulsion, i left the auto at IIMC gate

 First Eyewitness i met on East Zone, i met a person who is an eyewitness of the whole incident regarding the JNU dispute

 Students 'union President Kanhaiya was leading the procession and from the other side some students of ABVP were coming under the leadership of Saurabh Kumar, Joint Secretary of Students' Union

 The matter reached a beating
 vahaan maujuud security gards or police ne kisi tarah se maamle ko suljhaayaa jiske baad kanhaiya ne vahaan spich di
 However, there was nothing like treason in Kanhaiya's speech
 unhone bas ABVP or RSS ke virodh main apni baat rakhi thi
 'the rally was understood by the crowd, the eyewitness further said,' Few people involved in the rally knew that there was going to be something like sloganeering ahead
 jab idhar se narebaaji shuru hui to ABVP ne bhi jawaab main narebaaji kii
 The DSU people were raising slogans related to Afzal Guru, most of the people in the crowd were trying to stop the confrontation on both sides
 'admin block he JNU kaa taaja 'rankshetra'inhone apni baat khatm kii to ham aage bade jeenyu ke hriday sthal ganga dhabas kii taraf
 There was some commotion on the administrative block on the way

 Beside hundreds of students were present there in the form of a meeting

 With the release of Kanhaiya in his slogans, there was also the noise of the opposition of 'goondagardi' of RSS in the campus
 chaatro ko har taraf faile agenton kaa andeshaavhaa maujuud kuch logon se maine baat karne kii koshish kii
 But the campus atmosphere has become such that every unknown person is being viewed with suspicion there

 He said that it is not known who the man of IB, CBI and RAW is roaming here, so we cannot talk to everyone
 umr hi tha 'deshadroh' kaa aguwaavhaa maujuud DSF ke padaadhikari ishan se hamaari baatcheet hui
 Ishaan told us, 'the administration had earlier given permission for the 9 February program
 baad main ABVP ke bahut dabaav banane par kaarykram se ain pehle ye anumati waapas le lee gai
 The students took out a procession from Sabarmati Dhaba, which was being led by the DSU
 is juluus main saare leftist chaatr sanghathan maujuud the lekin narebaaji DSU vaale hi kar rahe the
 On the other side was the ABVP procession which was shouting slogans against this procession
 juluus khatm hone ke baad JNUSU president kanhaiya kumaar or rama naga ne vahaan bhaashan diya
 ABVP and RSS were opposed in these speeches
 isamen desh virdohi koi baat nahin thi
 There the two factions came face to face and the security guards, along with the policemen, defended the middle with great difficulty
 ''DSU har saal manaata he afjal jayanti'ishan ne hamen yah bhi bataaya kii DSU har saal afjal kii barsi par kaarykram karata he

 unhone mujhe jo bataaya wo kuch yun he, 'jeenyu kii sabase badi khaasiyat he iskaa democratic hona
 However sometimes this campus becomes extreme Democratic which is wrong
 kanhaiya bhale kii us ghatana main sidhe taur par shaamil naa rahe hon, lekin jis tarah ke logon ko wo plateform muhaiyaa kara rahe hai wo galat he
 They should think who to give a platform to, not to whom

 'campus environment is like unannounced curfew
 Apart from this, there is no police inside the campus but the atmosphere is like unannounced curfew

 in software kii charchaa rashtriya str par hone lagi he
 Some time ago these software were also praised in Hyderabad's National Police Academy
 ab taiyaari chal rahi he ki gujarat main safal rahe in softwaron ko rashtriya str par lagu kiya ja sake

 The storm named 'pillin' is just 450 kilometers from India
 or har ghante ye or kareeb aata ja rahaa he
 The next 24 hours are very important from the eyes of India
 bharat hi nahin videsh kii kai agesiyaan is tufaan par najar banaae hue hai, kyonki kuch vaigyanikon ko ashanka he ki ye tufaan super cyclone main tabdeel ho saktaa he or agar ye hua to tabaahi kai guna bad jaaegi
 14 years ago, after 'mahatufan' 1999, for the first time, such a huge storm has been prepared close to India
 14 saal pehle bharat main mahatufan aayaa tha, jisamen kareeb 15 hajaar logon kii maut ho gayi thi
 Now once again the same kind of winds have started moving
 mausam vaigyanikon ko ashanka he ki ye tufaan super cyclone yani maha tufaan kii shakl le saktaa he
 'pillin' will reach Andhra Pradesh on the night of 12 October
 The storm will touch Andhra Pradesh on the night of 12 October
 satellite se lee gai tasveeron main gol-gol ghoomte hue safed ghere ke rup main 'pilin' ko dekha ja saktaa he
 At present, the winds inside it are moving at a speed of more than 210 kilometers per hour
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik cyclone 'pilin' kii jabardast takat ke chalate samandar main bahut oonchi lehren uthne kii ashanka he
 On October 12, waves of up to 3 meters can rise in the seams of northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha
 abhi tak ke anumaanon ke mutabik iske 12 taarikh kii raat tak bhartiya tat par pahunchane kii ashanka he
 At present, this storm belongs to the Weary Seawear category
 lekin mausam vibhaag iske super cyclone yani mahatufan banane kii ashanka ko abhi khaarij bhi nahin kar rahe hai
 Heavy rains will occur up to North India, due to this, the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa are receiving heavy to very heavy rainfall
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki tufaan kaa asar sirf urisa yaa andhrapradesh tak simit nahin rahegaa
 Rather Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh will have heavy rains due to its effect
 iskaa ek trailor shuukravaar ko dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main dekha gaya
 Due to unseasonal unseasonal rains in Delhi, the temperature of the area was extremely low
 kin-kin ilaakon main much sakati he baari tabaahi
 
 
 Due to the 'pilin' storm, the local administration is evacuating the low lying areas of the sea shore in Puri, Gopalpur, Srikakulam, Ganjam, Kurta, Jagatsingh districts
 in sabhi jilon main kheti ko baari nuksaan pahunchnaa kareeb-kareeb tay he
 According to the Meteorological Department, Cyclone 'pylin', built in the North Andaman Sea, is about 500 kilometers from Paradip in Odisha
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik 12 taarikh kii subah se urisa, andhra pradesh or pashchim bengal ke samandar main halchal shuru ho jaaegi
 With this, the process of heavy rains will begin in these states
 khaas baat ye he ki uttar andaman main bana ye system prashanth mahaasaagar se bengal kii khadi main daakhil hua
 It will remain in the sea for as long as possible
 iske utane hi zyada khatarnaak hone kii ashanka bad sakati he
 For this reason, the central government and all affected state governments have come up for relief, but in spite of this the catastrophe is certain
 philhal bas ise kam karne kii kavayad jari he
 The NDRF and the administration are busy in preparations
 Around two crore people can come under the influence of 'pillin'
 sarkaar taiyaariyon main juty he, ab is taiyaari kaa sach to tufaan ke guzar jane ke baad hi saamne aayega
 It is clear from the pictures of satelliteite that the storm 'pillin' will touch the south-eastern part of India
 anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki chakravaat banane ke baad ye tufaan uttari andhra pradesh ke kalingapatnam or dakshin urisa paradeep ke bich samudr tat par takaraayega
 In view of the increasing destructive potential of 'pillin', the National Disaster Management Authority ie NDMA has alerted the state governments
 andiaref kii kai timen urisa or andhra pradesh main tainaat kar di gai hai
 The devastation caused by the storm cannot be stopped, but it can certainly be reduced
 isi vajah se bhartiya vayusena ko raahat or bachaav kaam ke liye tainaat kar diya gaya he
 Two IAF IL-76 ships of the Indian Air Force have started transporting the NDRF team and relief supplies to Bhubaneswar
 saath hi raipur, nagpur, jagadalpur, barakpur, ranchi or gwalior ke airporf base ko alert rahane ke liye kaha gaya he
 64 thousand people have been evacuated from the northern coastal districts like Srikakulam Vizag and Vizianagaram
 saath hi puure ilaake main 850 raahat camp taiyaar kiye gayi hai
 There will be a relief camp every kilometer
 andhra pradesh main halaat par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye prabhavit jilo main control room banaae gaye hai, jo sidhe rajya sachivalay main bane control room se jude hue hai
 With this much preparation, you can guess how serious the entire administration is about 'pillin'
 or pichley tufaanon se tajurba lete hue is baar koi bhi kor kasar chhodi nahin ja rahi he

 Politics operates day and night like a film

 44 Congress mlas have written on a stamp paper of Rs 100, but the West Bengal Revenue Department has earned only Rs 4,400
 isse zyaada kaa petrol vidhayak log apni gaadi start karne main phoonk dete honge
 The affidavit states, 'even if i do not agree with the party's policy or decision, i will not make negative comments or take negative steps to harm the party
 is tarah kii tippanee karne yaa kadam uthaane se pehle main apane vidhayak ke pad se istipha de duungaa

 One or two mlas left before the end of the meeting, they are not signed
 halafname main likhaa he, "vidhayak hone ke naate main party ke dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karuunga or vidhayak hone ke naate netaa vipaksh ke disha nirdesh kaa anusaran karuunga
 i will also follow the Chief Whip in the Assembly
 " In this way the affidavit has been dedicated to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 yah apane aap main gazab kaa maamla he
 In the affidavit, the mlas have promised full allegiance to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne likhaa he ki is tarah kaa halafanama apane aap main vicitra he
 Derek o'brien, defining a political party, wrote that a political party is a voluntary organization of like-minded people
 ye sabhi samaan siddhant main yakeen rakhte hai
 Is the Congress itself not confident that it is seeking an affidavit from its mlas
 derek o bryan ne iske bahaane trinmul congress kii jamkar tarif kar di
 In his article on ndtv
com, Derek has said that Mamta Banerjee is the only leader in recent history to run a separate political movement by forming her own party from the Congress
 baat congress kii karte-karte saansad sahab apane dal kaa bakhaan karne lage hai
 Like in TV debates
 pehali pankti aalochana kii hoti he, baaki kii pankti aatm prashansa kii
 From Bangla Congress, Tamil Manila Congress, Congress Tiwari to Nationalist Congress Party, Derek counted the history and scale of success
 zaahir he ginane kaa mauka congress ne hi diya

 Earlier in the year of 2014, Chairman of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations Lokesh Chandra had said - Modi ji is an incarnation of God for the poor
 unki jandhan yojana ko dekhiye
 Karl Marx has written a lot of things on poverty, but what was his real contribution
 modi ji ne garibon kii zindagi main kaaphi parivartan kiye hai
 In some aspects, he surpasses Gandhi and is an incarnation of God
 tippaniyan Prime Minister Modi made several tweets in the morning of February 2015
 kaha ki maine dekha he ki mere naam ke mandir banaae ja rahe hai
 i saw such news, i was shocked
 yah bharat kii parampara ke kilaaf he
 Our culture does not teach to build temples
 vyaktigat rup se main dukhi hua hum
 i request those who do not do this
 mandir banane se etraz kiya lekin bhagwaan bataane vaale mantri unke mantrimandal main hai or achche mantri hai
 At least Congress president and vice-president can tweet like this
 vaise indira gandhi ko bharat bataane vaale devkant barua ji ke rajya main ab bhartiya janata party kaa raaj he
 If it is done to save it from breaking, then the Congress does not have the opportunity to do it at the national level
 assam main himanta vishwa sharma party chhod bijepi main aa gaye
 9 other Congress mlas went after him in BJP uttarakhand main bhi 9 vidhayak bijepi main chale gaye
 If this is the problem, then the Congress should get all its members affidavit
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki vidhayak party main rah jaae or kaaryakarta pravaktaa upaadhyaksh sab chal de
 These affidavits were not brought by Congress mlas from their homes
 baithak main aae to congress adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary ne unhen diya or unhone dastakhat kar die
 Thick Fat was unanimously decided
 ek-do vidhayak baithak khatm hone se pehle chale gaye the, unke dastakhat nahin hai
 The affidavit states, "as an MLA, i will follow the party's guidelines and as an MLA, the leader will follow the guidelines of the opposition
 vidhansabha main chif wheep kaa bhi paalan karuunga
 " is tarah se halafname ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko samarpit kar diya gaya he
 This in itself is a case of wonder
 halafname main vidhayakon ne sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke prati sampurna nishtha rakhane kaa vaada kiya he
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien wrote that such an affidavit is bizarre in itself
 derek o bryan ne raajnneetik dal ko paribhaashit karte hue likhaa he ki ek raajnneetik dal samaan soch rakhane vaale logon kaa swechha se bana sanghathan hota he
 They all believe in the same principle
 kya congress ko khud main bharosa nahin rahaa ki wo apane vidhayakon se halafanama maang rahi he
 Derek o'brien praised the Trinamool Congress for this

 The first line is criticized, the rest of the line is self-praise
 bangla congress, tamil manila congress, congress tiwari se lekar rashtravaadi congress party sabakaa itihaas or safalataa ke paimaane ko derek ne gina diya
 It is obvious that the Congress gave an opportunity to count
 ginate-ginate ve aakhri paragraph main waapas halfmane vaale masale par aate hai or likhte hai ki kuch log is halafname ke bare main kah rahe hai ki yah chotii ke netaaon ke khilaaf baghaavat rokane ke liye he, jahaan party main surgery kii zarurat par jor diya ja rahaa he
 There is concern at the local level that these mlas may not go to the Trinamool Congress
 jaisaa ki ateet main hua he or chunaav se pehle adheer choudhary ne aisi ashanka bhi jataai he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has said that people in the Congress party are captives of the Gandhi family
 kuch dal ke log likhakar nishtha jataa rahe hai to kuch dal ke log nishtha jataane ke liye aisi-aisi baaten bol de rahe hai ki likhane main kaaphi acha lagata he
 In March this year, in a meeting of bjp's national executive in March, he said that Prime Minister Modi is a gift of God to India
 ve garib logon ke maseehaa hai
 The challenges of every sector are inherited and they are trying to meet those challenges

 Sadanand Gowda is working behind the scenes to garner support for his candidature
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon or jail kii hawa kha chukne ke baavjood yediurppa ke paas mukhar samarthakon kaa majboot janaadhar he
 Gowda insists that at the behest of the national leadership of the BJP, his 'sacrifice' of the chief minister's post in the past should be rewarded by giving him the post of party president
 yediurppa or gauda donon hi purv main is pad ko sambhaal chuke hai
 Party sources told India Today that the RSS is not in favor of either
 ek party netaa ne spasht kiya, ''aagaamee chunaavon main party kii naiya paar lagane ke liye yediurppa or lingayaton ke bich unka janaadhar party ke liye bahut jaruri he
 But the RSS does not want to take any risk with him seeing the sword of new cases hanging on Yeddyurappa's head
 unki mandali ne gauda ko baahar rakhane ke liye unke khilaaf bhi aise maamalon ko daakhil kiya janaa sunishchit kiya he
 The RSS was slightly more inclined towards Gowda
 aresas or bijepi sutron ne sweekaar kiya ki sangh ke varisht netaa prabhakar bhatta kalladka—tateey karnataka ke bijepi ke garh main jinaki baat hi kanoon kaa darja rakhti he—apane kshetra ke ek ummidavaar kii pairvi kar rahe the
 An RSS official says, "kalladaka cannot control Yeddyurappa
 unka jor gauda par chal saktaa he kyonki ve tateey kshetra ke netaa hai or chune jane ke liye aresas kii sadbhaavna par nirbhar hai
 But because there are cases against Gowda too, consider him outside as well
 ''is gambhir aantarik kalah ne aresas ke saamne aise pratishthit pad par lagbhag ek agyaat vyakti ko thopane kii sthiti paidaa kar di he
 Kalladaka, through the state organization secretary of BJP Santosh, surprised everyone and suggested the name of Nalin Kumar Katil, who became Mangalore MP for the first time
 bijepi ke ek mantri ne kaha, ''kalladka tikaton ke bantwaare or dhan ke pravaah par niyantran banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 This will not be possible if Yeddyurappa or senior BJP leader and national general secretary Ananth Kumar becomes state president
 tabhi to katil kaa naam saamne aayaa he
 "this may silence Gowda, who relies on the goodwill of the RSS, but Yeddyurappa will not accept it so easily

 It is said that Jaitley has assured Yeddyurappa
 par party abhi bhi vakt chaah rahi he kyonki aresas-bijepi ke jhagade main koi bhi nahin padana chahta
 Yeddyurappa, showing his popularity, has intensified competition by visiting drought-hit areas
 gauda or unki virdohi lobby ne unke khilaaf bayaan jari kar palatwaar kiya he
 But Katil has kept silence

 If you think that you know everything about your male partner, then you are wrong
 ve bhale hi dikhaave ke taur par yah jaahir kar den ki ve aapako apni har baat bataa dete hai, lekin yakeen maniye, aisa he nahin
 Your partner also has many such things in his mind, which he will never tell you
 kuch aise sach, jo ve bhuulakar bhi aapke saamne kholane kii himakat nahin karenge
 Of course, now you must have had a curiousity in your mind
 to jaaniye aakhir ve koun se sach hai, jo aapke purush saathi aapke saath kabhi baantnaa nahin chahenge
 So the first thing that they will never share with you is that they will treat it as part of their spontaneous behavior if they somehow make you feel comfortable during the bed or make an effort to persuade you
 kabhi aapako ye nahin kahenge ki asal main unhen aapako manaane ke liye minnaten kerani padati hai

 vajah- kyonki unke liye yah bilkul kisi singing sho ko dekhne jaisaa hoga

 unhen aapako sunanaa vaaki behad bhaataa he
 They want to listen to your thoughts and views, but you often talk about them, like clothes, your friends or something they will not like at all
 isliye agar aap chaahati hai ki ve dil se aapaki baaten sunen, to un baton main khud ko or apane rishte ko jagah den
 You must have often seen that your partner is silent about your father
 yaa bolta bhi he, to bahut kam
 So there can be only one reason behind this
 vah yah ki ve aapke pita ke bare main kuch or hi raay rakhte hai
 Whenever you talk to your father about them, they think that your father is not as good as you think

 This suspicious post has been liked and shared by a large number of people
 saikadon ne coment main modi ko vot dene kaa aashwaasan bhi diya he
 If India Today's Fact Check team investigated the net search by reverse search, it was not too late to reveal the truth
 tineye search se pataa laga ki hira ben kii thik aisi hi or bhi tasviren hai lekin unke haath main koi takhti nahin balki haraa dabba he, jis par pakistan sarkaar kaa chihn he
 On closer observation of the green box, there is also a greeting message in the corner which says in English - "mother of the Prime Minister of India"
 box ke andar likhaa he- “with the compliments of Prime Minister of Pakistan”
 When searching on Google Images with the keyword "hira ben + Pakistan", many results were revealed in which context the original image with the green box was taken
 bhartiya or pakistanimediamein is par kai report dikhin
 This report, published on 5 June 2014, clearly states that the white box is in the hand held by the Prime Minister's mother, which was sent by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif as a goodwill gesture
 isse pehle 26 may 2014 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dilli main shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa lene ke liye nawaz shareef pahunche the to modi ne unki maa ke liye laal dabbe main shawl bhent kii thi
 The very next day, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, daughter of Nawaz Sharif, also tweeted it
 dilachasp he ki jab aap ‘narendra modi whatrup group’ kefesbuk pejpar ‘about’ section main jaae to vahaan ise ‘krishi seva’ ke taur par bataaya gaya he

 And called them fashion icons
 saf ne kaha, "karina ko fishan kii adbhut samaj he
 She is always interested in clothes
 jab bhi ham milte hai, vah event main pahanane ke liye shandaar dresses kii kharidari karti hai
 i think they too should start benchmarking their fabulous dressage
 "kya kabhikrinounke liye bhi kharidari karti he? ye puche jane par saf ne muskuraate hue kaha, "nahin, bilkul nahin
 i choose my clothes myself
 agar aapako mahilaon ke kapadon kii acchhee samaj he, to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aapakon purushon ke kapadon kii bhi acchhee samaj hogi

 In this case he also drew attention to the mistake made by the US in Iraq
 modi ne council on fahrren relations main kaha ki bharat or america ne haal ke varshon main afghanistan main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 He said that India has told the US that the process of withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan should be slowed, so that the rise of Taliban can be stopped
 modi ne kaha, 'ham chaahate hai ki afghanistan jahaan haal main raashtrapati chunaav hue hai or nai sarkaar gathit hui he, main loktantric dhang se vikaas ho
 ' modi ne kaha, 'afghanistan se sainikon kii vaapasi kii prakriya bahut dhimi honi chahie
 Afghanistan should be allowed to stand on its feet and only then can it prevent the rise of the Taliban
 ' Asked if he was satisfied that President Obama referred to relations with India as' participatory ', Modi said,' Nothing can be satisfied

 December 16, 2012, Nirbhaya was gangraped
 chalati bas main 5 logon ne ek medical student ke saath darindagi kii sari intehaa paar kar di thi
 She was admitted to the hospital in an injured condition, where she continued to fight for life and death, lying in bed and eventually died
 nirbhaya ke saath hui is haivaaniyatke virodh main dilli sahit desh bhar main log sadakon par utar aae
 There was fierce sabotage with slogans against the police
 police ne nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this incident raised many questions
 kya nirbhaya cond ke baad dilli main mahilaon ke saath darindagi rukii he, kya mahilaayein aaj bhi surakshit hai
 After this incident, the Delhi Police assured women three years ago that now women will be safe
 raat ko bina kisi dar ke gharon se baahar nikal sakati he
 But even today women are afraid to leave their homes in Delhi
 muniraka ke jis bas stand par nirbhaya bas main baithi thi
 a girl standing at the same bus stand told that she is scared today
 haal hi main mahilaon ke saath-saath maasoom bacchiyon ke saath bhi darindagi ke maamle saamne aae
 Somewhere a two-year-old girl was victimized by evil intentions, and somewhere a five-year-old girl's childhood was trampled
 dilli main mahilaon ke saath jyaadati kam hone kii bajaae lagaataar badi he
 The witnesses in this case are the figures of Delhi Police related to the rape itself
 saal rape kii ghatnaayen2012 7562013 16362014 21662015 1856 (oktober tak)in aankadon se saaf he ki rajdhani main mahilaayein aaj bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Delhi Police should enact all the rules regarding their safety
 nae mobile eps laanch kiye taaki mahila kisi musiibat main ho to fouran uske jariye uski madad kii ja sake
 a women's help desk was set up for hearing of women in each police station, but the situation remains the same today
 sex life kaa acha hone aapke rishte ko majboot or khushhaal banaata he
 But if you are missing something in your sex life, then it can be related to your teeth
 ji haa, haal main hue ek shodh ke mutabik aapke daanton kii sehat aapaki sex life ko kharaab kar sakati he
 Researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia, believe that people who are emotionally distant from their spouse take care of their dental care regularly and visit a dentist
 60 second or 6 tips, bana denge sabko aapkaa divaana
 
 
 Research findings suggest that people who try to avoid emotional intimacy or are worried that their partner will leave or give them in times of need are more likely to have a negative impact on their oral health
 vahiin, duusari ore jo log aapanepartner se bahut pyarkarte he or ek-duusare par bharosa karte hai, unke daanton kaa swasthya bhi behatar hota he
 This happens because those people take care of their oral health and teeth
 yah shodh jarnal of quality of life research main prakashit kiya gaya he
 Religion connects the heart, does not break
 jo dharm kaa durupyog kar todane kaa prayaas karata he, vah dharmik nahin
 The one who uses religion to break hearts never succeeds in his objectives, history is a witness to this
