 According to information received by NDTV India, the ministry believes that this is an administrative report which will be subject to internal investigation

 yun to ranvir singh kii creginess ke kisse sabhi ko pataa he lekin is baat kaa ehsaas unki ko-star riddhimaa sood ko bhi ho chalaa he
 Riddhima Sood, who is working with Ranveer Singh in the Zoya Akhtar-directed film 'dil Dhadakne Do', is soon to make her Bollywood debut with the film
 riddhimaa bataati hai, 'aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki ranvir singh se meri mulaakaat set se zyada gym main hoti thi
 Whenever i go to the gym at any time, i used to find Ranveer Singh
 kai baar mujhe aisa lagata jaise unhone gym main apana boria bistar bicha liya ho
 Well, i did not share it with him, but yes Ranveer taught me some exercises which were beneficial for me
 iske alaava unhone mere juuton par bhi mujhe acha khaasaa lacture diya
 Actually i do yoga but sometimes i used to go to the gym and run for a while at the trade mill
 'riddhimaa ne aage bataaya, 'mere juuton ko dekhakar ranvir ne kaha, ‚Äòtum galat juute pahanakar daud rahi ho
 There will be no use for it, but yes it is possible that you fall on the tread mill or sit on your heel bones
 ‚Äô sach kahuun to mujhe juuton ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin
 For me sports shoe means gyming shoe but thanks Ranveer told me about it

 ' sargical strike par siyasat or daavon kaa silsilaa thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Sushil Kumar Shinde, who was the home minister of the country during the UPA government, claimed that 2-3 surgical strikes were done in the UPA regime as well
 ek samachar agency se baatcheet main scindia ne kaha ki upie shashan main bhi sargical strike kiye gaye the lekin iske bare main tathyon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya or naa hi kiya janaa chahie
 Parrikar had rejected the Congress claim, on Wednesday, before the Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar rejected the Congress's claim that a surgical strike had been done earlier
 gauratlab he ki 28-29 sitambar kii raat indian army ne pioke main ghuskar aatanki thikaanon par hamale kiye the or sena ke dijiemo ne isaki ghoshnaa bakaayade press conference karke kii thi
 In this surgical strike, the commandos entered the pok for three kilometers and destroyed the terrorist launching pads
 is oparation main kam se kam 50 aatankiyon ke maare jane kii khabar ai thi or aatankiyon ke bachaav main aae pakistani sena ko bhi isamen bada nuksaan hua tha
 Since then, a series of claims and politics has started
 During UPA Govt 2-3 surgical strikes were carried out, but such facts were & should not be revealed: Susheel Kumar Shinde, Ex Home Ministerpic
 twitter
 com / oij5gbesrj‚Äî ANI (@ani_news)october 13, 2016pavaar ne bhi kiya tha 4 sargical strike kaa daavacangress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne daawa kiya ki upie ke shasankaal main bhi pioke main ghuskar sargical strike kiye gaye the lekin suraksha kaarnon se iskaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya
 After this, NCP President Sharad Pawar, who was an ally in the UPA government, also claimed that 4 surgical strikes were carried out while he was the defense minister
 bhartiya sena ne sargical strike ke jariye aatankiyon ke saath-saath pakistan ko bhi karaara jawaab diya he
 In fact, the latest example of how terrorist camps are being conducted in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir has been revealed through a video
 uri hamale se kuch dinon pehle aatankiyon ne soshal media par ek video aplod kiya tha
 The video was uploaded through the Pakistani network from POK
 'aaj tak' ke paas maujuud video main aatanki pehali baar kisi piem par nishaanaa sadhate hue najar aa rahe hai
 In the video, terrorists are talking about targeting the name of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kathith video main aatanki kashmir kii aazaadee or bharat kii barbaadi ke naare lagaate hue bhi najar aa rahe hai
 Actually, the terrorists present in the video have been named Kashmir Mujahideen
 suraksha agenciyon or sibar exparts ne jab website or kathith video kii padtaal kii to chaunkaane vaala sach saamne aayaa
 In fact, the IP address and location of the website came out in the investigation, whose network was reported in Pakistan
 padtaal main pataa chalaa ki soshal cites par maujuud salmaan choudhary naamak profile se fasebuk, twitor or google plus par lagaataar aatanki video aplod kiye ja rahe hai
 a few days before the Uri attack, some videos were uploaded from the same account
 sibar exparts ko acount kii padtaal main pataa chalaa ki yah acount saal 2014 main active hua tha
 After which videos of continuous training are being uploaded from this account
 newclear war par bhi hoti he batisamen se kai video main to 2016 main bharat-pakistan ke bich newclear war kii baat bhi kii ja rahi he
 It can be guessed that on a large scale in the pok, a conspiracy is being hatched to destroy Kashmir and India in a very high-tech manner
 internet par kathith website or soshal media ke in acounts ko pioke ke usee hisse se chalaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan beete dinon bhartiya sena ne sargical strike kar aatanki addon ko tabah kiya tha
 Pakistan Army and ISI are helping Madhayani It would not be wrong to say that now there is a conspiracy of war against Kashmir and Hindustan with the help of Pakistani Army and ISI in pok
 kathith video main aatanki pioke main chalaae ja rahe aatank ke training campon main training lete najar aa rahe hai
 At the same time, in the video, terrorists are also shouting slogans to liberate Kashmir and continue the war till the ruin of India
 lambey arase se punap rahe hai aatank ke training campabatate chalem ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir kii sarajameen par lambey arase se saikadon aatanki camp pakistani sena auraiesaike ishaare par punap rahe hai
 The terrorists infiltrate India extensively after completing training and target the innocent people
 darasal pioke main chal rahe in aatanki campon par lagaam kasnaa or inhen nestnabud karnaa bharat ke liye hameshaa se hi mushkil rahaa he
 Indian Army showed its courage recently, Indian Army showed its courage and valor by destroying many terrorist targets being operated in POK through surgical strikes
 sargical strike ke jariye naa sirf aatanki campon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya balki darjanon aatankiyon ko bhi maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 The terrorists are disillusioned with the surgical strike that on one hand these terrorists are being prepared for attacks in India, on the other hand, youth are also being misled by uploading videos of terrorist training on the Internet
 baharhaal bharat sarkaar ne jis tarah se aatankwaad ke khilaaf sargical strike kar apane iraadon ko saaf kar diya he, usase pioke main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ke bich baukhalaahat saaf najar aa rahi he

 And unless Kapil Mishra gives evidence of his allegations, his fast will continue
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party se nishkasitakapil mishraaap netaaon ke videshi yatraaon kaa hisaab maanga he
 Kapil Mishra, who had been sitting on a dharna for the last three days, reached Rajghat on Friday
 apni patni or chand samarthakon ke saath unhone baapu kii samadhi par prarthana kii
 During this, he also burst into tears
 unhone kaha ki dilli sarkaar se jawaab milane tak dharna jari rahegaa
 Mishra will visit Hanuman temple on Saturday
 bihar main sharabbandi lagu he or sharaab pine par rajya main sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan he, lekin kam se kam jaan se maarane ke sajaa kaa praavdhaan to nahin he, lekin ek hathi ne apane mahavat ko sharaab pine kii aisi sajaa di jise shaayad kisi ne aisa sochaa hoga
 Drinking liquor in Dehri village of Buxar became costly when the elephant killed the Mahavat in anger
 ghatana ke sambandh main praapt jaankaree ke anusaar dehri gaanv ke rahane vaale raghuvansh raay ne shaukia taur par hathi paal rakhaa he, jisaki dekhbhaal ke liye unhone madhyapradesh ke jhaansi jile ke banda ke rahane vaale munna shukla (50 varsh) naamak vyakti ko pichley 3 varshon se apane yahaan rakhaa hua tha
 It is said that Mahavat used to cross the Karmnasha river near Dehri village daily and go to Uttar Pradesh from where he used to come after consuming liquor
 ravivaar kii shaam ko bhi vah uttar pradesh se sharaab pikar aayaa or usne hathi se chhedchhad kerani shuru kar di
 Due to which the elephant got angry and crushed him with the feet and killed Mahavat
 is bich ghatana ke samay hathi ke maalik raghuvansh raay bramhpur main ghoda kharidne ke liye gaye hue the
 The next day when he reached Shire Ghat on the spot, he saw this scene
 ghatana kii soochna paakar maukey par chausa bidio tathaa thanadhyaksh pahunche evam shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bheja
 During this time, the owner of the elephant, Raghuvansh Rai, opened the elephant and tied it very easily
 baharhaal, van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko ghatana kii soochna de di gai he
 At the same time, there are various types of discussions in the village about the incident, people say that if the Mahavat had not had alcohol, he probably would not have died today
 aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa yogendra yadav ke chehre par kisi shaks ne dilli main ek kaarykram ke dauraan syaahi phenk di
 The incident happened when the party was organizing an event on Women's Day in Delhi
 is ghatana se naaraaz 'aap' ke kaaryakartaaon ne us shaks ko pakad liya or uski pitayee kar di
 The police intervened and removed the man from there
 syaahi phenkane vaala vyakti aam aadmi party kii topi pahane hue tha or 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare laga rahaa tha
 The man was identified as Sagar Bhandari
 usne khud ko naaraaz 'aap' kaaryakarta bataaya
 Yogendra Yadav said that i do not know who he was and why he did it
 unhone kaha, main apane chehre par syaahi phenke jane se pareshaan nahin hum, main keval yahi chahta hum ki jis bhai ne aisa kiya he, use sadbuddhi mili
 Arvind Kejriwal, convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, says that walking on the path of truth causes such problems
 vahiin congress ke netaa rajeev shukla ne is tarah kii harakat ko sharmnaak bataaya he
 If Team India leaves for Bangladesh on Sunday morning, the challenge will be different in front of Virat Kohli and his team
 bhartiya team vahaan bangladesh, srilanka, pakistan or afghanistan kii tiimon se bhidegi or isamen uski takat ke alag‚àíalag pahaluon kaa andaja ho jayega
 From this tournament, Virat Kohli's ability to score points will surely start as captain
 viraat kohli or mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini kaa style alag he
 a glimpse of this has been found during the IPL
 lekin is baar viraat kohli ko jo jimmedaari di gai he, unke har faisle par sabaki paini najar rahegi
 Like Dhoni, he will set a new record of success and will be able to take Team India ahead of the questions, everyone is interested in it
 bataur captain mahendra singh dhoni or viraat kohli bilkul do alag shakhsiyat hai
 One gave historic success to Team India dilaai hai, to ek kal kii ummiido kaa nayak he
 One has a long list of titles, so one has high hopes for titles
 viraat kohli apane aakraamak tevar ke liye jane jate hai
 Be it batting or captaincy, Virat Kohli maintains his stance
 jabaki pichley kareeb saat saalon main team india ko ek aise captain kii aadat padi hui he, jo field par ranneeti khilaadiyon ke pradarshan or aage dekhte hue faislon kaa tension apane dimag main rakhata he
 But it has never been easier to read it on Captain Cool's face
 vahiin viraat kohli kaa style alag he
 He is aggressive and does not hide his feelings
 khaas baat yah bhi he ki under 19 se lekar ipel or team india kii captaini ke dauraan viraat kohli ke faislon par ab tak sawaal nahin khadey hue
 Whereas Dhoni's decisions have raised questions many times since the World Cup
 dhoni ne kai baar bade nattejey dekar diggajon ko peeche hatane par majaboor kar diya, lekin is baar rahul dravid se lekar saurav ganguli tak dhoni ke faislon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai or dhoni ke paas philhal shaayad iskaa jawaab nahin he
 Captain Kohli, who made the U-19 team the World Champion in 2008, came to play in the big league, even then his attitude remained intact
 rahe
 The Giants did not delay in recognizing him that Virat Kohli could hold the command of Team India for a long time
 viraat kohli ne 6 saal pehle under 19 world cap main apni team ke liye tanmay shrivastav ke baad sabase zyada 6 maichon main 47 ke ausat se 235 ran banaae the
 There is no question of Kohli's ability as a player and his performance as a captain has been sparkling
 bataur captain ab tak khele gaye 8 vanade maichon main unka ausat 66
 He has been 4, during this time he scored two centuries, while Virat averaged 51 in 130 odis
 85 rahaa he or unke naam 18 shatkeey paariyaan rahi hai
 Team India's constant defeat on foreign land has raised many questions on Team India
 viraat kohli ko ab tak har baar videshi jameen par hi captaini kaa mauka mila he
 In 8 occasions so far, Virat Kohli has not let his team and fans down 7 times
 viraat kohli dhoni kii parampara ko aage badha pate hai yaa nahin isaki agni pariksha kaa daur shuru ho chukaa he or kohli ke jawaab kaa intjaar jaankaar bhi kar rahe hai or phens bhi

 Former Australian player Sean Tate's heart fell on Indian model Mashoom Singha and both of them got married in the past
 khabar to ye bhi he ki tet ne ab mumbai main hi rahane kaa man bhi bana liya he
 If the news is to be believed, Tate is now dreaming of taking the field from Team India
 khabar he ki tet or maashoom singha 2007 se relationships main the
 Tate was not bought by any team in the IPL auction for 2014, while he has been playing for Rajasthan Royals before this
 bataaya jaataa he ki tet ne paris main maashoom ko prapoj kiya tha

 There is also a gym here
 shandaar takanic or laajawab temprament ke maalik bharat ke stylish ballebaaj ambati raidu aaj apana 29waan janmdin manaa rahe hai
 Rayudu is among the players in India who, despite having talent, did not get much limelight
 lagbhag 11 saal tak gharelu cricket kii bhatti main pakane ke baad raidu ko 24 july 2013 ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf apana debyue karne kaa mauka mila
 Rayudu came to be called the next Sachin Tendulkar from his early days
 unke adbhut tallent ko dekhte hue 2004 under-19 world cap main unhen bhartiya team kaa captain banaaya gaya or unki captaini main bharat ne semifinal tak kaa safar tay kiya
 In 2002, Rayudu created a sensation in his debut Ranji season with a bang
 unhone hyderabad kii taraf se khelte hue ek hi match kii pehali pari main dabl centuri or duusari pari main shatak jad kar bhartiya cricket main hangaamaa machaa diya
 However, if not luck, what can be said that Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina and Dinesh Karthik, who played under the captaincy of Rayudu, got an opportunity to play for India before them
 2007 main shuru hue indian cricket lig (isiel) main khilne ke kaaran bisisiai ne raidu par bain laga diya
 Due to which he got away from the structure of domestic cricket
 haalanki 2009 main isiel ke saath apana qaraar todakar raidu bisisiai dwaara sanchalit dhaanche main shaamil hue
 Rayudu, who has seen ups and downs in his life, is one of the few players in India who can bat at any number for the team
 jitne maukey bharat ke kuch khilaadiyon ko mili hai utana mauka agar raidu ko bhi mila to nishchit hi unka naam bhi bharat ke bade khilaadiyon kii suchi main hoga

 mumbai main jab film 'shandaar' kaa trailor jari karne film kii team ikattha hui, tab inke bich behtareen chemistry dekhne ko mili
 The atmosphere was filled with laughter and everyone stood in support of the film's hero Shahid Kapoor
 jaahir he ki shaadi ke baad jab shahid kapur media ke saamne aaenge to unase shaadi ke sawaal puche hi jaaenge
 The same happened here, but more than ever, his heroine Alia Bhatt was giving more answers than him and sometimes his producer Karan Johar
 tippaniyan When the media asked Shahid a question about his marriage, Alia quickly jumped in and said that Shahid has had a wonderful marriage
 uske baad jab shahid se sawaal poocha gaya ki shaadi main sabase acha tohfa kya mila tab bhi jawaab dene aalia hi maidan main utrin or kaha ki shahid kii shaadi main unhen tohfa mila 'shandaar'
 On hearing this reply of Alia, Karan Johar also jokingly replied and said that we had packed Alia in Shahid's wedding as a gift
 jaahir he ye chemistry jo film 'shandaar' ke prachaar ke samay najar aa rahi he, kuch aisi hi chemistry ko film main bhi dekhe jane kii ummid he
 It is obvious that when Shahid Kapoor will come in front of the media after marriage, he will be asked questions of marriage
 aisa hi yahaan bhi hua, magar unase zyada jawaab kabhi unki heroin aalia bhatta de rahi thim to kabhi unke nirmaataa karan johar

 agar aap khud ko ek paripakv mahila samajhane lagi hai to aapako khud se apni jindagi se jude kuch sawaalon ko jarur poochna chahie
 We get so busy in the rush of our lives that we sometimes forget to live
 thodaa rukkar khud se kuch sawaalon ke jawaab puuchhie or dekhie ki aap apni jindagi ko kya sahi tareeke se ji rahi hai?1-kya main sahi vyakti ke saath hum?kya aapaki jindagi main aisa koi shaks he jisase aapaki jindagi kii khushiyaan bad gai hon? jaise-jaise umr badhati he, vakt keemtee hone lagata he or ham apane har ek pal ko khubasurat bana lenaa chaahate hai
 If you are in a relationship with someone, then ask yourself if you can share everything with this person throughout your life? Are you with the right partner? How is the relationship with 2-parents? Have you ever hurt parents with any of your work? Is your relationship with your parents not right? The regret of these things increases with the passage of time, so definitely consider your mistakes
 3-main apni body ke saath kitni sahaj hum?hamamen se shaayad hi koi aisa ho jo khud ko bilkul parfect maanata ho
 Everyone wants some change in themselves
 lekin kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aapkaa apni body ke saath rishta kaisaa he? kya aap khud ko swasth or feet rakhane ke liye dhyaan detii hai? kya kaam karte vakt aap shaareerik rup se kitna majboot mahasoos karte hai
 4- What bothers 'what will people say'? Are you taking care of your own happiness or do you take every step with fear of what people will think? Do you do everything for your pleasure or because of the permission of other people
 kya aap ab bhi soshal media par logon ko dikhaane ke liye tasviren post karti hai yaa phir khud ke liye
 These are questions that you must think about
 5-kya main khush hum?ant main sabase zyada jo cheez myne rakhti he vah he hamaari khushi
 Whatever we do, we do it only to be happy in life
 isliye ek baar khud se jarur puuchhen ki kya aap khush hai? agar nahin to aapako ye sochane kii jarurat he ki kya aapako khushhaal bana saktaa he

 i and he liked the script of 'reason Tum Ho'

 i did this film not because of the intimate scenes, but because of the different character
 vishaal pandya nirdeshit 'vajah tum ho' main sharaman joshi or rajnish duggal jaise sitare pramukh bhamika main hai
 The film will be released on 2 December
 gurmeet ko vishwaas he ki unki shaadishuda jindagi main peshey kii patibaddhtaon kii vajah se koi galatfahami nahin aegi

 Highly placed sources confirmed to India Today that from November, ASI will excavate some major sites on the ghaggar-hakra river route

 The Ghaggar River originates from Himachal Pradesh and passes through Punjab and Haryana to Rajasthan

 asi's plan is to identify ancient habitats in the early parts of the ghaggar-hakra river route later this month to begin a fresh excavation

 a highly placed source told India Today, on condition of anonymity, ‚Äúour objective is limited

 "such excavations can prove to be very important in the discovery of river valley civilization
 phoonk-phoonk kar kadamis baar ees kaaphi satark ta se niyamon ko saath lekar chal rahaa he or isaki durust vajahen bhi hai
 In 2006, a parliamentary panel headed by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury questioned the flaws in the process and the scientific basis of the nda-initiated Saraswati Heritage Project
 isane ees kii khinchaai karte hue poocha tha ki aakhir yah santhaan kisi nadi ke punaruddhar or anveshan kii pariyojna ko kaise apane haath main le saktaa he jab kisi bhi santhaan ne aise adhyayan ko manjuuri nahin di he, jo ki buniyadi shart he
 With the change of government, this time ASI has received several proposals, including the proposed excavation on the ghaggar-hakra river route

 The city of Kalipanga, the Harappan in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan was situated in the Ghaggar river
 yahaan bahut pehle khudaai kii ja chuki he or yahaan ees kaa sangrahalay bhi he
 He told India Today by mail, "ASI and other scholarly organizations are operating in Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat and have discovered many important sites and archaeological material
 haryana ke bhirana jaise sthalon par pai gai nai saamagree kaa vivaran isa purv aathvin sadi tak bhartiya sabhyataa ke nishandehi karata he
 ASI and other institutions will carry out excavation work on new sites in the region and it will be decided soon after the CABA standing committee meeting
 ‚Äùmani ne 14 se zyada anveshan pariyojnaon kaa nirdesan kiya he jinamein laal kot (dilli), salimgarh (dilli), mohammad nagar or harnol (haryana), siswaniya, sankisa, ayodhya, laathia (upi) or kanispur tathaa ambaran (jammu-kashmir) shaamil hai

 yahaan khudaai main aise mitti ke baratan mili hai jinhen ‚Äòhakaraa ware‚Äô kaha jaataa he
 This confirms that the cultural level found in the 'lost' Saraswati river valley is the cradle of Indian civilization
 ‚Äù unka daawa he ki bhirana, rakhigadhi or kalibanga main praapt radiometric tareekhen spasht taur par bataati hai ki is upmahadweep main hadappa samskruti ke vikaas ke charan kya the
 This suits the campaign for the revival of the Saraswati river, which will be seen as not only a river but a civilization

 For this, a committee consisting of four members was formed and a plan of excavation was made in two phases

 As Bisht says, "unfortunately, the new government cleverly put the project on hold
" ‚Äùritair hone ke baad bhi bisht ko endie sarkaar ne chah maah kaa seva vistaar diya tha taaki ve pariyojna ko aage le ja saken
 He stopped work when the government changed
 ab ek dashak baad siyaasi hawaaon kaa rukh phir badal gaya he
 It is believed that ASI has quietly asked for suggestions about the sites to be dug in search of Saraswati
 ve kehete hai, ‚Äúpariyojna ko shuru hone se pehle hi maar diya gaya or sirf isliye ki nai sarkaar aa gai
 This was seen as an attempt to saffronize

 He told, "I think ghaggar-hakra has nothing to do with Saraswati

 The search for Saraswati has been taking place since the British era and gradually the matter has become political

 Nainjot Lahiri, professor of history and archaeologist at the University of Delhi, says another point
 ve kahati hai ki saraswati kii sanak se paar janaa kahin zyada ahm he
 In his words, ‚Äúinstead of Saraswati alone, the Center and the Ministry of Culture must present a comprehensive national vision for archeology that covers the entire country
 ‚Äùyahaan yah bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki iity kanpur ne pichley saal nadi ghati main gaharaai main bade jal strot ko khoj nikaala tha

 High Court order embarrassing for the Center Encouraged by the High Court's decision on the jurisdiction of the anti-corruption Unit of the Delhi Government, Chief Minister Kejriwal said that the decision of the court is a 'great embarrassment' for the Center
 unhone kaha, 'dilli hai court kaa vah aadesh rashtriya rajdhani ke logon ke liye badi jeet he, jisamen spasht kiya gaya he ki bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha (asibi) ke maamalon main dakhal dene kaa kendriya grih mantralay ko koi adhikaar nahin he
 'kejriwal said,' i want to congratulate you on the decision of the High Court

 40 years ago, it had jurisdiction over all Delhi based agencies, be it central government, DDA, police, MCD
 asibi in sabhi nikaayon ke bhrashtachar ke maamle kii jaanch kar sakati thi
 The Chief Minister said that during his 49-day government last year, a case was registered against a big man of this country, Mukesh Ambani
 unki sarkaar jane ke baad centre ne ek nirdesh jari karke asibi ke daayre ko sirf dilli sarkaar ke adhikariyon tak simit kar diya
 He said, 'it has been said that ACB will not look into corruption of central government officials, police and NDMC
 lekin hai court ne aadesh diya he ki centre or grih mantralay ko asibi ke maamalon main dakhal dene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he

 somvaar ko open cabinet main kejariwal ne kaha ki 1992 se bijepi is mudde par jor detii rahi, lekin ab puri tarah palat gai he
 He said that the BJP had promised to give full statehood to Delhi in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections and the 2014 general election manifesto, but no decision was taken by the current government
 'hamaari deshbhakti bikaoo nahin'sabha ko sambodhit karte hue dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ne kaha, 'hamen janata ne naukari par rakhaa he or ham yah bataane aae hai ki ham sahi se kaam kar rahe hai

 jaankaree ke mutabik uttari dilli main vitaran sanbhaalane vaali tata kii company tipididiel ne takreeban 700 karod ke nuksaan kii baat apni yachika main kahi he

 He alleged that the university records have been manipulated and the government's conspiracy behind it
 agar yah degree farji hoti to baalkrishna passport hasil karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kyon karte, jabaki bina degree ke bhi aam naagarik passport banavaa sakate hai
 He alleged that such incumbent charges have also been leveled against the office bearers of persons sitting at the peak of power

 ye ve log hai, jo apane mobile ke prem main is kadar dub chuke hai ki unka samoochaa vyavhaar, swasthya or jivan hi uske chakkar main badalata ja rahaa he
 Psychologists working in this field are trying to uncover this mysterious relationship between the mobile phone and the owner

 jharkhand main giridih jile ke bagodar thana police ne pashu taskaron kii badi sajeesh ko naakaam kar diya
 Actually, SARIA SDPO Deepak Kumar Sharma had received a secret information that animals are being taken illegally to Kolkata by filling three containers in three containers on the way of Barhi on GT Road
 soochna par esadipio ne bagodar thana prabharee rajeev kumaar ke netritv main team gathit kar jiti road par tainaat kar diya
 During the investigation, when gestures were made to stop the three containers, the animal smugglers tried to trample the police party and flee with vehicles
 police ne overtek kar teenon gadiyon ko roka or teenon gadiyon ke chaalak or khalasi ke alaava ek vyapaaree samet saat logon ko dhar dabocha
 When the police opened the container door, she was stunned to see the inner scene
 teenon container main 108 jaanwaron ko thuns-thuns kar rakhaa gaya tha
 Three of these animals had died
 esadipio ne bataaya ki pashu taskari main shaamil sabhi saat logon ke khilaaf pashu krurta adhinium ke alaava kanoon kii alag-alag dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 During interrogation of the arrested animal smugglers, the names of many more people involved in this racket are set to be revealed
 do container ke peeche dak parcel or ek container ke peeche svachh yogi raaj likhaa hua he
 Also, there is no number plate in any of the three containers
 isse samajha ja saktaa he ki pashuon kii taskari ke liye kaise-kaise hatkande apanaae ja rahe hai
 The SDPO said that a case has been registered against all the seven people involved in animal trafficking under different sections of the law apart from the Animal Cruelty Act
 giraftaar pashu taskaron se poochtacha ke dauraan is racket main shaamil kai or logon ke naam kaa khulaasa hona tay he
 The postal parcel is behind two containers and clean Yogi Raj is written on the back of one container
 saath hi teenon contenron main se kisi main bhi number plate nahin he
 It can be understood that how the tactics are being adopted for the smuggling of animals
 mathura jile main ek nurse se gangrape or uskaa ashleel video banane kii ghatana main teen logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 "bhoomesh, a commander of a private hospital in a posh colony in the city, called the nurse who worked with him on July 8 on the pretext of his birthday party and raped him
 ''unhone bataaya ki is bich, vahaan maujuud bhupesh ke mitra kuldeep ne is ghatana kaa video banaaya or phir usne bhi nurse se dushkarm kiya
 After this, both of them raped her several times by blackmailing her on the pretext of the video
 chandra ne bataaya ki is bich, kuldeep ke ek anya mitra narendra ne bhi video clip viral karne kii dhamkee dekar nurse ko blackmel karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin jab peedita ke uski baat nahin maani to usne video viral kar diya
 The nurse then informed her family about the incident and filed a case against the trio on Saturday

 All the three accused are absconding

 To what extent can a model go only to gain entry to Bigg Boss house? What can she do to defame someone using the media? You will be stunned to hear this
 soch kar hi shame se sir jhuk jaataa he ki kya koi sirf or sirf publicity pane ke liye 16 disambar kii us nirbhaya kaa bhi istemaal kar sakati he jis par puraa desh royaa tha?ji haa, wo mayanagari kii model he, jisane mumbai police ke diaiji sunil parskar par rape kaa ilzaam lagaaya tha
 The model, along with a lawyer, made a sensational rape charge on the DIG in order to confirm his entry in the TV reality show Bigg Boss
 ab sawaal ye he ki rape jaise sangeen maamle kaa reality sho big bos se kya lenaa dena? akhir kisi par yun hi rape kaa ilzaam laga dene bhar se big bos kaa tikat pakkaa kaise ho saktaa he? or sabase ahm ye ki sirf big bos main entry lene ke liye koi yun hi kisi par itnaa sangeen ilzaam kaise laga saktaa he?kya sirf big bos ke ghar main ghusane ke liye koi model mumbai police ke itane bade afasar se bevajaah takaraane kii gustaakhee kar sakati he?darasal ye model apane vakil rigwaan siddiqui se uske chembar main aakar mili thi
 After this, all the conversations that take place are recorded
 baatcheet kaa ye audio or sisitivi video kisi or ne nahin balki khud model ke vakil ne hi jari kiya he
 However, this lawyer has now been replaced by the model
 aaie ab khud apni ankhon se dekhie or kaanon se suniye ki aakhir kya he model ke rape kaa sach?model-tum socho kii ham kisi ko kaise fansaa sakate hai
 How does it happen in a movie
 vaise vaala plot taiyaar karo
 Lawyer - You have to move, don't you? Model - Yes, you find it
 vakil-main apane hisaab se dhundta hum
 The model's conversation with advocate Rizwan dates back to those early days when the model was asking her lawyer to implicate such a victim
 tabhi usne kaha ki kuch aisa karo, jaisaa filmon main hota he
 But it is clear from the video of the next conversation between the two that by then DIG Sunil Parskar had come on the radar of this model
 model-mujhe uski bed publicity kerani he
 Lawyer - leave that to me
 model-ai rili vanna haireas himavakil-wo mere pe chhod domodel-note haresment
 
 uski bed publicity kerani he
 Do not disturb him
 do teen din news main jane do
 That's all i want uski image karaab kerani he or kuch nahin
 By the way, if you believe this video released by the lawyer himself, even the lawyer himself appears ready to defame Parskar
 ab baat notice se shuru hoti he or phir dhire-dhire mukadmaa darj kar sazaa dilwane par jaakar khatm hoti he
 In the conversation, the lawyer constantly advises
 vakil-human site kamishan main shikaayat daalana he kya
 The model - who is giving the notice right now - to strip her naked and for your publicity, look at what will become of it
 isamen do teen chizein hongi
 One will be infamous
 oke
 
 punam pandeya ke thru ye karata he
 We will put it indirectly
 tumko punam pandeya ko atake karnaa he naa inke thru
 Model - Yes, it will be through the sailor - you can go through it
 
 Second, departmental inquiry can be conducted on it
 model-uski gandi publicity hone do
 Make some good publicity of me
 thodi gandi bhi hone do
 The extent is that for this publicity, this model itself is also ready to get its own decision
 iske liye wo jo kahati he had se zyada sharmnaak or afsosna he
 Because in this conversation from the media to the December 16 Nirbhaya talks about the use
 model-tumhen lagata he ki agar ham rakesh mariya ke thru pressure de to kuch hoga
 Check what we say
 vakil-nahimodel-nahin karegaa?vakil-kuch nahin karenge
 
 media bajaati rahegi
 Won't do anything 
 He knows the case of Delhi

 When the model was taken to that level, the lawyer was big
 sabase bada mines point ye he ki public ko lagegaa kii ye tum publicity ke liye kar rahi ho

 Followers will say that you have done for publicity
 ye thodaa negative impact ho jaayegaa
 However, after releasing this conversation of his client, now the lawyer is saying that he was not told by his client then that she was going to register a case of rape on an officer
 baharhaal, is maamle kaa puraa sach kya he
 This will be clear only after a complete investigation, but the story is not over yet

 On Monday, Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi declared, "if the Constitution of India allows us, we would be very happy to shoot offenders against women or hang them
" 
 
 " During a media briefing, the 59-year-old police chief said in an excited tone, "there are some 150-200 men who only look at women as if they were watching them in a blue film
" 
 
 
 isi vajah se ve ek do maheene kii bacchee yaa 80 saal kii vriddha ko bhi apane shikaar ke taur par dekhte hai
 
 
 " iske alaava dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ke saath lagaataar vivaadon main ghire rahane vaale police kamishnar ne ek or vivaad ko hawa dete hue kaha, "yah dilli police kii khushkismati he ki vah dilli sarkaar ke tahat kaam nahin karti
 
 
 " is bayaan ke bare main vistaar se samajhaate hue bies bassi ne kaha, "kyonki ek pradhanmantri kaa dilli main koi hit nahin hota, ek grahamantri kaa bhi dilli main koi hit nahin hota, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri ke sthaneey hit zarur hote hai
 
 
 For this reason, the Delhi Police does not come under political response, whereas in other places it is possible
 
 
 so, dilli ke log shat pratishat bhaagyashaalee hai ki dilli police dabaav main kaam nahin karti
 
 
 " gauratlab he ki dilli police kendriya grih mantralay ko report karti he, or rajya kii police par niyantran ke masale ko lekar centre tathaa rajya sarkaar ke bich lambey arase se vivaad chale aa rahe hai
 Supporting the current system, Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi has clashed several times with the current Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal on different issues, whose administration alleges that the Delhi Police has repeatedly tried to please only the central government
 Tries to degrade tippaniyan Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has repeatedly accused the Delhi Police of failing to maintain law and order, after which once BS Bassi even challenged the Chief Minister for public debate
 somvaar ko bies bassi ne kaha ki unke vibhaag ne trephic police ke 1,000 sipaahiyon ko hathiyaarband karne kaa faisla kiya he, lekin unhone is faisle ke peeche ke kaarnon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya
 He also said that the traffic police, which is facing the problem of shortage of personnel, will also have helicopters from next year to help maintain order on Delhi's roads
 ek media brifing ke dauraan 59-varshiya police chif ne uttejit swar main kaha, "kuch 150-200 mard aise hote hai, jo mahilaon ko sirf usee najariye se dekhte hai, jaise ve unhen kisi blue film (porn film) main dekh rahe hon
 
 
 For this reason, they also consider a two-month-old girl or an 80-year-old girl as their victim
 
 
 " Apart from this, the Commissioner of Police, who has been engrossed in constant disputes with the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi, gave vent to another controversy saying, "it is a good luck to the Delhi Police that it does not work under the Delhi government
" 
 
 " Explaining this statement in detail, BS Bassi said, "because a Prime Minister has no interest in Delhi, a Home Minister also has no interest in Delhi, but the Chief Minister of Delhi definitely has local interests
 
 
 isi kaaran acha he ki dilli police rajnatik jabaav main nahin aati, jabaki baaki jagahon par aisa mumkin he
 
 
 So, the people of Delhi are 100 percent lucky that the Delhi Police does not work under pressure

 Former diplomat and minister Natwar Singh made several revelations in a conversation with Headlines Today channel
 inamen se kuch ke bare main lagbhag sabhi ko jaankaree thi or kuch aisi bhi thim ki pehali baar jagajaahir huin
 The biggest disclosure among these was that Rahul Gandhi had told his mother not to become the Prime Minister
 unka kahana tha ki is pad par baithne vaali unki daadi or pita kii nrushans hatya hui or vah apni maa ko khona nahin chaahate
 Due to his insistence, Sonia Gandhi did not accept becoming PM and Manmohan Singh was elected
 isi tarah unkaayah khulaasa ki 1991 main sonia gandhi shankar dayaal sharma ko pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati thim na ki narsingh raav ko, hairaan kar dene vaala he
 Natwar Singh was among those leaders who had great importance in the party and who were among a handful of close relatives of Sonia
 unke khulaason par ungali uthaane kaa koi kaaran nahin
 After all, if Sonia Gandhi did not become Prime Minister, there was definitely a reason for that
 unhone mahaj tyaag kii khatir aisa kiya, yah maanane kii koi thos vajah nahin he
 There is no reason to believe that Sonia and Congress misbehaved with Natwar Singh, because of which they wrote these things elsewhere
 natwar singh kii baton main ho saktaa he kuch atishyokti ho, lekin ve sach se dur nahin hai
 His talk that Sonia Gandhi had access to every important file has already been verified
 manmohan singh ke salaahkaar rahe doctor sanjay baru ne saaf kar diya tha ki pulok chatarji ke jariye tamaam filein sonia gandhi tak pahunchaai jaati thim
 However, the question is not whether Natwar Singh is telling the truth or not
 sawaal to yah he ki agar natwar singh galatabayani kar rahe hai to sach kyaahai? sonia gandhi yah kahkar is maamle ko taal rahi hai ki ve bhi ek kitaab likhengi
 But what will happen when the book is written, it is futile to speculate from now on
 philhal to natwar singh ne jo khulaase kiye hai unke bare main baaten kii jaaen
 If Natwar Singh were to stain Sonia Gandhi, he could have made serious accusations against her, but he did not think it appropriate to do so
 congress lagbhag chah dashakon tak satta main rahi he or us dauraan kai bade ghotaale or galtiyaan huin, natwar singh chaahate to unamem se kaiyon kaa vah khulaasa kar dete
 But he did not think it appropriate to do so due to his decoration and prudent nature
 natwar singh ke is intervyuu se jo baaten saamne ain unamem sachai dikhti he
 Sonia Gandhi did not need to react so much to this

 He played an important role in fulfilling his son's dream by working as a laborer
 mushkil se do vakt kii roti jutaney vaale pita ko bete kii is kamyaabi par vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa he
 However, Ramdayal attributes this achievement to the hard work of son Mohan
 mohan sagar ne satr 2013 main indira kala sangeet vivi se grajuation kii padhai bhi neshnal scolership se puri kii he

 pakistan kaa naam liya janaa haal kii surkhiyon kaa hissaa he, lekin in sabake bich jeenyu se bahut dur nawaz shareef ne ye kabuula he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii peeth par chura ghonpa gaya
 The comments jab pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi lahore kii bas yatra par gaye the, thik uske baad hi kargil ko anjaam diya gaya
 Nawaz Sharif himself is saying this after so many years, this again reveals the weakness of the elected governments in Pakistan, because everyone remembers that Kargil was executed by the Pakistan Army
 ye pakistan ke ravaiye ko bhi bataata he ki uskaa ek hissaa kabhi bhi bharat ke liye aman or dosti kaa rasta nahin maanata
 Whereas a part which includes the governments and political heads there has been trying for years
 haal hi ke dinon main nawaz shareef ke paariwarik kaarykram main narendra modi pahunche the, jisase kisi ko aitraaj nahin ho saktaa he lekin saath hi ye bhi jaruri he ki pakistan ke us hisse ke ravaiye ko bhi naa bhoolen jo kargil se lekar 26 / 11, or 26 / 11 se lekar pathankot ke peeche ho saktaa he
 Kargil was executed just after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee went on a bus trip to Lahore
 itane saalon ke baad ye baat nawaz shareef khud kah rahe hai, isse ek baar phir pakistan main chuni hui sarkaron kii kamajori saamne aati he, kyonki sabko yaad he ki kargil ko pakistan kii sena ne anjaam diya tha
 It also explains the attitude of Pakistan that a part of it never accepts the path of peace and friendship for India
 jabaki ek hissaa jisamen vahaan kii sarkarein or political mukhiya bhi shaamil hai, ye koshish salonsaal karata rahaa he
 In recent times, Narendra Modi had reached Nawaz Sharif's family event, so that no one can mind but at the same time it is also important not to forget the attitude of that part of Pakistan which goes from Kargil to 26 / 11, And may be behind Pathankot from 26 / 11
