 Gujarat High Court appeared divided on the issue of appointment of Lokayukta by the Governor
 ek jaj ne ise sahi tehraaya to duusare ne bhinn vichaar vyakt kiye
 The court dismissed the petition of the state government challenging the appointment of Justice RN Mehta to the post of Lokayukta by Governor Kamala Beniwal on August 25

 She began to read her verdict but could not complete it until the time the court was up for the day
 vah apana baaki kaa faisla mangalvaar ko sunaaengi
 In case of a split verdict, the matter can go to the third judge

 He said, when the Chief Justice suggested Mehta's name, the Chief Minister and his cabinet rejected his name
 donon ke bich gatirodh tha or aisi sthiti main ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish kaa vichaar sarvocch he
 Judge Qureshi said that since the previous Lokayukta retired in the year 2003, the government did not start the process of deliberations till 2006 and when the process started in the year 2006, there was no appointment till the year 2011
 unhone kaha, hamaara yah drushtikon he ki maujuuda saamaajik-aarthik sthiti main lokayukta kaa pad ek mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karata he or ise lambey samay tak khaali nahin rahanaa chahie

 The court further said, there seems to be disturbances in the process of SSC examination

 police kii sakriyata dekhakar sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya is maamle main police dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya se bhi poochtacha karegi
 The medical report that came out of Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash shows that he was beaten up
 kyonki report ke mutabik, unke chehre par cat kaa nishaan he or kandhe par chot ke nishaan bhi hai
 mlas Prakash Jarwal and Amanatullah Khan are arrested in the meeting
 lekin chunki yah baithak mukhyamantri ke kehane par bulaai gai thi, isliye police kii jaanch kii aanch untak bhi pahunch sakati he
 The police also detained Arvind Kejriwal's advisor VK Jain on the basis of Anshu Prakash's complaint and detained him for about 3 hours, though he was later released
 wike jain ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki unke saamne kisi bhi tarah kii marpet nahin hui
 Kejriwal's advisor VK Jain was detained just because he had asked the chief secretary to come to the meeting over phone
 lekin chunki sara vivaad arvind kejariwal or manish sisodiya ke saamne or unki maujuudagi main hua he, aise main maamle kii puri sachai jaanane ke liye dilli police in do netaaon se bhi poochtacha kar sakati he

 He said that the police of the Central Government are the officers of the Center and there is bound to be hooliganism
 bijepi naa kaam kar rahi he or naa hi karne de rahi he

 The BJP neither works nor allows it to work, now the public will teach them a lesson
 — Sunita Kejriwal (@kejriwalsunita)february 21, 2018ye he puraa maamalamukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ne aarope lagaaya tha ki somvaar der raat mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke awaas par unhen meeting ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 During this, the Aam Aadmi Party mlas pressurized them to release government advertisements and beat them up
 is ghatana ke baad mukhya sachiv ne mangalvaar ko dilli police main shikaayat di, jiske baad okhla vidhayak amanatulla samet anya vidhayakon ke khilaaf cese darj kiya gaya

 olympics padak vijeta emasi mairicom kii kahani agle maheene rupahale parde par hogi jiskaa intazaar mairi com ke saath−saath khelon se judi filmon ko pasand karne vaale fans betaabi se kar rahe hai
 But perhaps a bigger challenge for Mary Kom is to qualify for the Incheon Asian Games and win a medal there
 glassgo kaamanwealth khelon kii kamyaabi ke baad mahila mukkebaazon se ummiden to badi hai, lekin unki chunautiyaan kam nahin hui hai
 The impact of winning a silver and a bronze medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games is evident in the punch of around forty boxers practicing at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in Delhi
 glassgo kaamanwealth khelon main 60 kilogram varg main rajat padak jeetne vaali sarita devi kii pahchaan behatar hui he or vah isse khush bhi nazar aa rahi he
 After Glasgow's success, Sarita Devi got the opportunity to spend five days with her husband Thoiba Singh and one and a half year old son Tomathil
 isi dauraan vah puraskaar samaaroh or tivi intervues ke liye bhi samay nikaalati raheen
 Soon she started practicing in the ring with double vigor
 sarita kahati hai maa banane ke baad is medal ko jeetne se main bahut khush hum or isse meraa aatmavishvaas bhi badha he
 Sarita Devi knows that her challenge in the Incheon Asian Games is going to be very different from this
 vah kahati hai china or uttari korea kii khilaadiyon se shaayad unhen kadi chunauti mil sakati he, lekin vah ye bhi kahati hai ki duusare deshon ke mukkebaaz ab bhartiya boxrs ko halkaa nahin aankate
 Therefore, they have psychological advantage against boxers from other countries
 kuch yahi haal hisar kii pinki rani kaa he
 Pinky Rani of Glasgow Commonwealth Games is content with the bronze medal
 vah jaanati hai ki asiad main jane ke liye ek baar phir unhen olympics padak vijeta emasi mairicom se takkar leni hogi jo aasaan nahin hone vaali
 Mary Kom looks better than ever
 haalanki pinki kahati hai, 'mairicom meri role model hai
 i have been watching her boxing for almost eight years
 meri tamanna thi ki unhen haraa kar naam kamaun
 i was able to do this because of fighting in the same weight category
 ek baar asiad jane se pehle unhen haraane kii chunauti hogi
 ' in khilaadiyon ke tryles patiala main 26 agast ko hone hai
 Three Indian boxers will get a chance to play in the Incheon Asian Games
 inamen se koun baazi maaregaa ise kehane kaa zokhim koi coach nahin uthaanaa chahta
 It can also be called a sign of better bench strength in India
 asiad main in khilaadiyon ke saamne china or korian mukkebaazon kii mushkil chunauti to hogi hi
 a major difficulty is that for the last two years, the International Boxing Association has canceled the recognition of the Indian Boxing Association
 aise main khilaadiyon ko videshi toornament main jane kaa mauka naa ke baraabar mila he
 For example, in the last two years, Indian women boxers have got the opportunity to participate in only one international tournament besides the Commonwealth Games
 jaankaar maanate hai ki isse unki mushkilon kaa safar lanbaa ho gaya he
 At the same time, the team's head coach Anoop Kumar says that facilities are being provided by the government, but due to the ban of federation, international tournaments could not be found, it caused a lot of damage
 coach hemlata bagadwal bhi maanati hai ki videshi khilaadiyon ke saath nahin khel paane se khilaadiyon ko mushkil hui he
 She says the challenge will surely be different in Asiad
 mahila mukkebaazi main khaaskar mairicom ke landan ke olympics padak ke baad badlaav to aae hai, lekin is khel ke karta−dharta bade str par ise bhunaane main utane kaamyaab nahin rahe hai
 Sarita Devi, who became DSP in Manipur Police, says, “there have been many changes since Mary Kom's London medal
 khilaadiyon ko naukariyaan mili hai
 Sponsors have come
 hamaari pahchaan bani he
 But the lack of international experience is evident
 bhartiya boxing sangh kii danvadol haalat ke baavjood mahila mukkebaazon ne glassgo kaamanwealth khelon main jo kamyaabi hasil kii he, vah kaabile taareef he
 But most coaches and players including Vijender Singh, Mary Kom and Sarita Devi have complained of lack of international level matches
 iskaa kaamiyaaza bhartiya mukkebaazon ne glassgo main bhugta or ho saktaa he ki inchiyan asian khelon main bhi bhugatna pade
 So their real test will be in the Incheon Asian Games, where they will really know how much power is there in the punch of Indian boxing
 duniya ke khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas ne ab ek nae mobile ap ko apana hathiyaar banaaya he

 aage congress kii koshish ye he ki, jin siton par congress or bijepi main muqabla dikh rahaa ho, vahaan sapa-basapa gathbandhan usee lihaaj se ummidavaar de
 Also, where the SP-BSP candidate is in the competition in front of the BJP, the Congress should field the candidate to defeat the BJP

 The Congress wants to pressurize the SP-BSP with the argument that the Congress will be the candidate to win the first choice of minorities in national elections

 loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi 2014 se bhi badi jeet se saath ek baar phir satta main vaapasi kii he
 Narendra Modi will take oath along with his cabinet on Thursday 30 May
 haalanki iske saath hi ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii maang uthne lagi he
 The Shiv Sena reminded the Ram temple that it got the mandate in the name of Shri Ram
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ke saath hi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki prabhu shriram kaa kaam karnaa he or ram kaa kaam hokar rahegaa
 After the Sangh chief, Shiv Sena has also reminded the construction of Ram temple
 iske alaava shivasena ne narendra modi ke shapath grahan kii tulana bhagwaan ram ke rajbhishek se kii he
 The Shiv Sena on Wednesday reiterated that in the editorial of Saamana, the construction of Ram temple has been written that the work of Shri Ram will be done, the promise has been given by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 desh kii satta main shriram ke vichaaron vaali sarkaar ai he
 Also said that Ram Rajya should be established in the country, hence crores of people have voted for Modi openly
 shivasena ne kaha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho iske liye saikadon karsevakon ne apana balidaan diya he
 Will not let their martyrdom and blood go in vain
 aisi vichaardhaara kii sarkaar chun kar ai he
 The Shiv Sena has compared Modi's swearing in with the coronation of Prabhu Shri Ram in Ayodhya, tying the bridge to Modi's praise
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki akhand hindostaan (hindustan) kaa sapana saakaar hoga or duniyabar main shriram ke desh kii jai-jayakaar hogi
 This is what we call Ramrajya
 shivasena kaa maananaa he ki modi ne raamarajy kii katibaddhta vyakt karte hue bharosa jataayaa he ki is baar ram kaa kaam hoga
 The Shiv Sena, while taunting the opposition, has compared its opponents to Ravana, Vibhishan and Kansa
 shivasena ne modi sarkaar ko ramamandir kii yaad dilaate hue kaha ki chunaav se pehle narendra modi ne spasht kiya tha ki ayodhya main ram mandir kii neenv rakhi jaaegi hi lekin wo kanoon or sarvocch nyaayalay kii sahmati se hoga
 We agree with his role, but the Supreme Court should accept public sentiment or mandate
 shivasena kaha ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav kaa nateeja raamarajy or ram mandir ke samarthan main diya gaya janadesh he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena has described this victory of NDA as the blessings of Shri Ram
 ayodhya jaaenge shivasena saansadloksabhaa chunaav main jite apane sabhi saansadon ko shivasena ayodhya lekar jaaegi
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had reached Ayodhya before the election and also met all the parties there
 shivasena ne kaha ki pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee ne shriram kaa naam lene waalon par hamale kiye
 Nevertheless, Amit Shah kept cheering on Shri Ram and the BJP won in Bengal
 saath hi kaha ki congress raaj main ram andhere main the, lekin ab ayodhya main diwali hi hogi
 Notification of by-elections has been issued for Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh and Araria Lok Sabha seat of Bihar
 chunaav ayog ne in teen loksabhaa or bihar kii do vidhansabha siton par upachunaav kaa elaan kiya he
 Apart from this, by-elections will be held in Jehanabad and Bhabua assembly seats of Bihar
 is sabhi siton par 11 march ko matdaan or 14 march ko nattejey aaenge
 According to the Election Commission, the process of nomination for the by-election will begin from February 13 and February 20 will be the last day of nomination
 23 farvari ko namakan waapas lene kii taarikh hogi
 All seats will go to polls on March 11 and counting will take place on March 14
 bataa den ki upi ke keshav maury ke dipti siem banane ke baad phulpur loksabhaa seat khaali hui or gorakhpur seat se saansad rahe yogi adityanath ke siem banane ke baad khaali hui he
 At the same time, Araria Lok Sabha seat is vacant due to the demise of RJD MP Taslimuddin
 bihar kii jahanabad vidhansabha se argedy ke vidhayak rahe mundrika yadav or bhabhua se bijepi ke vidhayak rahe anand bhushan pandeya ke nidhan ke chalate khaali hai he
 The by-election is Yogi's first fire fight in Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency of Gorakhpur and deputy CM Keshav Maurya, called the fort of BJP
 bijepi ke liye in donon siton ko apane paas rakhane kii chunauti he, jabaki vipaksh ne unhen gheraabandi karne kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen that how Yogi and Keshav keep their strongholds by breaking the opposition's strategy? Actually, if the mathematics of Gorakhpur and Phulpur are seen, there has been a very interesting battle in both the parliamentary constituencies
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko in siton par sabhi vipakshi dalon ko mili kul voton se bhi zyada vot mili the
 That is why it is a big challenge for the BJP to maintain its dominance in both the seats

 After the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistani army and some terrorist organizations running terror shops from Pakistan's land are trying to reach out to the terrorists in the valley through the Chalcode word of Pakistan to contact the terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir
 Are dazed by baukhalaahat is kadar he ki ve aatankiyon se sampark saadhane ke liye koding kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Indian intelligence agencies have recently revealed some code words, which were being used by the Pakistan Army and various militant groups there to contact militants in Jammu and Kashmir to spread violence in the area
 sutron ne yah jaankaree di he
 It is learned that these code words are sent through an FM transmission near the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)

 The dialogue is being done through Pakistan's national anthem 'qaumi Tarana', which took place on August 5, almost a week after the repeal of Article 370

 saujanyh newsflix Subhash Velingkar has been the head of the RSS in Goa, but was removed from the post in August 2016 due to rebellion with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and opening a front against the BJP
 unhen aresas pramukh ke pad se hataae jane ke virodh main aresas ke kareeb 300 se zyada kaaryakartaaon ne istipha de diya tha
 Let me tell you that Velingkar was associated with the RSS for the last 54 years
 tippaniyan Actually, Velingkar's confrontation with the BJP government is going on in the issue of medium of education in schools
 weylingkar ne bijepi par rajya kii bhashaa 'konkani' ko khatm karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The controversy over language divided the state into two
 jahaan ek dhada skulon main shiksha ke madhyam ke liye english kii maang kar rahaa he, to vahiin weylingkar ke samarthak konkani or marathi bhashaa kii maang kar rahe hai
 Wellingkar also accused former Goa Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Manohar Parrikar of cheating voters
 aresas se naata todane ke baad unhone goa suraksha manch (GSM) kaa gathan kiya
 In order to give a tough fight to the BJP in Goa assembly elections, GSM formed a grand alliance with MGP, Shiv Sena and Geva Praja Party
 darasal skulon main shiksha kaa madhyam ke mudde par bijepi sarkaar ke saath weylingkar kaa takaraav chal rahaa he
 Wellingkar accused the BJP of abolishing the state language 'konkani'
 bhashaa ko lekar paidaa hue is vivaad ne rajya ko do hisson main baant diya
 While a section is demanding English for the medium of instruction in schools, the supporters of Welingkar are demanding Konkani and Marathi language
 weylingkar ne goa ke purv mukhyamantri va bijepi ke varisht netaa manohar parrikar par bhi matadaataaon ko dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 After breaking up with the RSS, he formed the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM)
 goa vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko kadi takkar dene ke liye jiesem ne emjeepi, shivasena or geva praja party ke saath milakar mahagathbandhan kiya
 Wellingkar also accused former Goa Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Manohar Parrikar of cheating voters

 akhilesh kaa kaarykaal (dedh saal)kul dange: 107 *mritkon kii sankhya: 125vajah: dharmik unmaad* keval un dangon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jinamein teen din yaa usase adhik samay tak karfu lagaaya gaya
 Mayawati's tenure (five years) Total riots: 6 * Number of dead: 4 Reason: Religious mania * Only those riots that involve curfew for three days or more
 lakhanu main vidhansabha satr ke dauraan 18 sitambar ko mujffarnagar dangon se gussaya vipaksh akhilesh yadav sarkaar ko nishane par liye hue tha
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan was persuading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Legislature's leader Hukum Singh not to walk out, while favoring the government over the riots
 is bich mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kuch kahana chaahate the lekin ajam unka haath dabaakar unhen chup rahane kaa ishaara kar rahe the
 But Akhilesh could not stay away and finally he stood up and took a dig at the opposition and accepted, "the Muzaffarnagar riot will always be a bad look on my political life
 ”yah badnuma daag aise yuva or mridubhashi mukhyamantri par he, jinhen unki purvavarti mukhyamantri mayawati ke mukaable zyada loktantric, mridubhashi or milansaar mana jaataa he
 This basically shows the difference in working style between 40-year-old Akhilesh and 58-year-old Mayawati
 purna bahumat hasil karne ke baad ek ore jahaan akhilesh ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye unki hi party ke varisht netaa taiyaar nahin the, vahiin chunaav ke pehle din se hi mayawati apni party kii nirvirodh netaa rahati hai or satta kii iklauti centre hoti hai
 In contrast, in Uttar Pradesh, it is being said that there are five and a half chief ministers in the state, and who is half the chief minister? Akhilesh Yadav
 jaahir he, yah sab araajaktaa kii vajah se he, or yah araajaktaa sabase zyada dangon ke samay numaayan hoti he
 The plans were not implemented last year, after the Samajwadi Party (SP) government formed in March last year, the Chief Minister came to know about the challenges coming after the communal riots at Kosikalan in Mathura on 2 June
 yahi vajah thi ki is dange ke 15 dinon ke bheetar 18 june ko rashtriya ekikaran vibhaag ne ek shasnadesh jari kar rajya main sampradayik sauhaard banaae rakhane ke liye uthaae jane vaale taur-tareekon kaa zikr kiya tha
 In this, the formation of District Integration Committees was mandated under the supervision of the District Panchayat President for communal harmony in every district
 samiti kaa mukhya kaary har maheene kam-se-kam ek baithak kar un binduon ko tatolna tha jinase jile yaa ilaake main sampradayik tanebane par chot pahunch sakati thi
 The CDO was responsible for preparing the details of each such meeting and sending it to the government
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki aadesh jari hone ke dedh saal baad bhi kisi bhi jile main aisi kisi samiti kaa gathan nahin hua he or is dauraan 107 chote-bade dange ho chuke hai
 Against this, only six such incidents took place in the BSP regime in which curfew was imposed for three days or more in an area due to communal tension
 bareli, mau, saharanpur, baharich, meerut, gajiabad main dangon kii chinagaari bhadki lekin in sabhi ko failane se turant roak liya gaya tha
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui, national general secretary of the BSP and in-charge of the Muslim Brotherhood Committee, says that the brotherhood committees were actively working from the state to the booth level in the BSP government
 har maheene ke pehle hafte main in cametiyon kii baithken ho jaati thim jinamein samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke log shirkat karte the
 "the details of every meeting were sent to bsp's district headquarters and from here to the state headquarters," Siddiqui says
 agar in cametiyon ke madhyam se kisi bhi ilaake main sampradayik sauhaard bigadgaye kii khabar milti to party ke padaadhikari adhikariyon ke saath milakar turant uskaa samaadhaan karaate the
 Mayawati used to keep a close eye on the administrative things of Iqbalmayavati
 kya-kya hota tha mayawati ke shashan main:--dijipi, pramukh sachiv grih or mukhya sachiv se roj mukhyamantri awaas par subah 10 baje meeting-electronic or print media main aane vaali krime kii khabaron par mayawati kaa sidhe najar rakhana-dange or aparaadh rokane main naakaam aparaadhiyon par kadi se kadi karrwai karne main jaraa bhi der nahin lagaana-mayawati ne apane kaarykaal main adhikariyon main gutbaji ko dur rakhane ke liye iees association kii baithak ek baar bhi nahin hone di-cabinanet sachiv shashaank shekhar singh kii dekharekh main mukhyamantri karyaalay main asardaar adhikariyon kii tainaatidangon ko lekar 'jiro tolerance’yahi nahin, dangon ke maamle main mayawati prashasan kaa jiro tolerance bhi tha
 Although nothing happened in the area after the Imam of a mosque in Kazipur, Meerut, in April 2011, the city was gutted
 prashasan ne sakhti barti or maamle ko teen din ke bheetar dabaa diya
 Nevertheless a police station and DIG was suspended and transferred to the Collector
 duusari ore, sapa ke kaarykaal main dangon kii jhadi lag gai
 And Muzaffarnagar had the biggest riot after Gujarat
 ritred police mahanireekshak es
 s
 darapuri bataate hai, ''upi kii police ko sarkaar kaa bhi dar nahin rah gaya he
 This is the main difference between the SP and the BSP government's police
 ” 2007 main soobe kii sarkaar par kabiz hote hi mayawati ne police vibhaag main pehla kaam sab inspector se lekar aarakshi ke tabadale main unke ghar ke paas tainaat hone ke praavdhaan ko khatm karke kiya tha
 But Akhilesh Yadav, after becoming Chief Minister, overturned Mayawati's decision and restored the system of posting officers and employees near her house
 pichley saal june main 25,000 se adhik police karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ke tabadale kiye gaye
 Although this decision was better for the officers and employees, it proved to be very damaging to the regime
 police karmchaariyon ke apane ghar ke sameep tainaat hone ke baad se hi unke pakshpatpurna ravaiye kii jaankaree shashan ko mil rahi he
 An official of the Home Department says that in the recent criminal incidents in Varanasi, Allahabad, Meerut, there were complaints of policemen stationed in the police station helping their acquaintances
 yahi nahin, mujffarnagar dange main bhi badi sankhya main sab inspector se lekar head consteble tak ke bhedbhaav purna tareeke se kaam karne kii report mili he
 In the Muzaffarnagar riots, senior officers of the state police did not camp themselves on the spot and on 5 September, Inspector General of Police (IG, Law and Order) R
 ke vishwakarma ko mujffarnagar camp karne ke liye bheja jo swatantra rup se koi nirnay lene main sakasham nahin the
 This was the first time that the top officials of the state police department had not camped at the site of the incident in such a sensitive case
 mayawati sarkaar main dijipi vikram singh, ediji brajalaal or pramukh sachiv grih kunwar fateh bahadur samvedshansheel maukey par khud jaakar nichle adhikariyon kii kaman sambhalate the
 Swami Prasad Maurya, the Leader of the Opposition and BSP spokesman, says, "there was a fear among the authorities that if they do not work, strict action will be taken
" aise main adhikari puure damakham ke saath kaam karte the
 The biggest challenge to save the communal atmosphere of the state from deteriorating during the reign of BSP leader Mayawati came on 30 September 2010 when the Lucknow bench of the High Court gave its verdict on the Ayodhya dispute
 yah tatkaaleen sarkaar kaa prashasnic kaushal hi tha jisane soobe main sampradayik tanaav kii chinagaari tak footne nahin di
 Three months before the High Court's decision, such a full-fledged scheme of direct monitoring from the tehsil to the village was prepared
 afvaahon par kaabo or sandigdhon ko paband karne kii yah sakht yojana 2012 main sarkaar ke badalte hi thande baste main chali gai
 This is the reason that despite any rioting after another, the administration has not taken any precautionary measures in any place
 bebasii kaa khulaa izhaarmayawati ke mukaable akhilesh kii sarkaar naukarshahon ke saamne khuleam apni bebasii jaahir karti he
 a person associated with the SP government quoted the Chief Minister as saying, "the officers are against the government
 ve der tak daftaron main rukkar photocopy karke sarkari faislon ko chunauti dene ke liye soochna li karte hai
 "it shows the helplessness of the Akhilesh government overall
 iske ulat, mayawati ke sabase bade adhikari divangat shashaank shekhar ne puri naukarshahi ko changul main kar rakhaa tha
 While Durga Shakti was in a tizzy over the suspension of a new officer like Nagpal, the IAS Association could not do anything on the suspension of a senior officer like Promila Shankar in Mayawati's administration
 mayawati ne paanch saal thasak ke saath raaj kiya or dangamukt shashan diya, lekin pradesh kaa saamaajik sameekaran ve apane paksh main nahin rakh pain or chunaav haar gayi
 It is now a challenge for Akhilesh to save his social equation because the riots hurt a large part of his mass base - Muslims
 agar ve afasaron ko control nahin kar paae to 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi kaa purana naaraa phir rang laa saktaa he, ''chadh gundan kii chaati par, mohar lagaao hathi par

 The Indian Army, the second largest army in the world, has suffered a shortage of armaments and the condition has become so bad that it does not have enough ammunition even for 20 days of fighting
 yah sansanikhej khulaasa kiya he ek angreji akhbaar ne
 According to the newspaper, the Indian Army, with about 1
2 million soldiers and officers, has a huge shortage of ammunition
 tinkon, vaayu raksha pranali, topakhana ke liye bhi amunishan nahin hai
 But the army is silent on this
 itnaa hi nahin bhartiya sena ke paas 20 dinon kii badi ladaai ke liye bhi ab gola-barood nahin he
 The rule regarding ammunition is that the Vestage Reserves consumed in the war should be sufficient for at least 40 days of war
 kam samay tikne vaale gola-barood kam se kam 21 din ke liye hone chahie
 This is also confirmed by a statement by Indian Army Chief General Vikram Singh in which he said that the Army does not have 50 per cent Walk Vestage Reserve
 iskaa matlab hua ki uske paas 20 dinon kii badi ladaai ke laayak bhi gola-barood nahin he
 Efforts are being made now that only by 2019 can the situation improve completely
 ab sena nai sarkaar ke banane kaa intjaar kar rahi he taaki 19,250 karod rupee ke gola-barood kii kharid ho sake
 With this, the army will be able to fight the entire battle
 gola-barood kii kami ko tatkaal dur karnaa isliye bhi jaruri ho gaya he ki sena ne ek nayaa strike corps taiyaar karnaa shuru kar diya he jisamen 90,000 jawan or officer honge
 It is getting ready to maintain India's sovereignty over the Himalayas and will be built in seven years

 isse pehle janvari main 33 varshiya bhartiya mul kii singapori mahila se francfort airport main german police kii ore se yah sabit karne ko kaha gaya tha ki vah apane bachche ko doodh pilaati he yaa nahin
 It has become a habit to suffer apartheid, says that now he has a habit of tolerating discrimination
 agar line se aapako jaanch ke liye chunakar baahar nikaala jaataa he, to behad bura mahasoos hota he
 But what happened this time, he has crossed all the deadlines

 Her husband comes from Iceland

 The world's first 'women's Special' train, which started between Churchgate and Borivali stations in Mumbai, has completed its journey for 26 years today

 ' a shocking case has emerged from the Turkish Western Panchayat of Meenapur police station area of muzaffarpur in Bihar
 yahaan par ek kaliyugi baap jab jue main sabakuch haar gaya to usne apane 5 saal ke bete ko hi daanv par laga diya
 Father's name is Santosh Kumar
 bete ko haarane ke baad santosh dar gaya
 The winning man Ram Bhajan said that now we have won, so give your son to us
 jab ram bhajan ne bachche ko le jane kii koshish kii to gaanv main jamkar hangaamaa hua, donon pakshon main jamkar marpet bhi hui
 However, Meenapur police is still unaware of the case
 is ilaake main jue kaa khel hameshaa se charchaa main rahaa he
 On Sunday, people were gambling in Ghari village of Meenapur's Turkey
 khel ke dauraan dojuaariyonke paise khatm ho gaye
 Even after this, both did not give up
 donon main se ek shaks ne to apane 5 saal ke bete ko hi daanv par laga diya or kaha ki agar main haar gaya, to meraa betaa tumhaara jabaki duusare ne kaha ki agar main haara to jindagi bhar tumhaari gulaami karuunga
 After this, the game started between the two
 pehle paksh kaa game ulta pad gaya or vah apane bete ko jue main haar gaya
 When the other side asked for his betteco after winning the game, there was a fierce fight between the two
 is maamle ko sulajhane ke liye gaanv main panchayat baithai gai or sajaa ke rup main donon ko uthak- baithak karai gai
 The village sarpanch, Arun Kumar Choudhary, asked the loser to hold a meeting fifty times, and the person who won the child was given a sit-up meeting twenty-five times
 log uthak- baithak kaa video bana rahe the or panch tamaasha dekhte rahe
 Meanwhile, a man from the village slapped the child's father

 ek jamaane main bahujan samaaj party (BSP) kii pramukhmayawatike daahine haath maane jane vaale nasimuddin siddiki guuruuvaar ko congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Siddiqui joined the party in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Congress President Rajabbar and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad
 gulab nabi aaazaad ne is maukey par yojit press conference main kaha, 'ham aaj un sabhi netaaon kaa swaagat karte hai, jinhone kaaphi lambey samay tak basapa, upi vidhansabha main kaam kiya he
 He said that people now want to work with Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 congress party desh main ek baar phir majboot hokar ubharegi
 Today we welcome all the workers of the Congress Party
 'gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, hamen puraa vishwaas he ki nae saathiyon ke aane se hamaara sanghathan or majboot hoga
 He said, big alliances are for achieving big objectives, so small things are not kept in sight
 basapa se sambandhon par padane vaale prabhaav ke sawaal par congress pravaktaa aaazaad ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle basapa pramukh mayawati ne bhi hamaare vidhayakon ko apni party main shaamil karaayaa tha
 We did not get angry
 iske baavjood ham log mayawati se gathjod karne ke liye gaye
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui joining the Congress will not affect the alliance in future
 ye hue congress main shamilauttar pradesh ke purv mantri or basapa ke purv netansimuddin siddikike saath opi singh, liyaaqat ali, achche laal nishad, arshad khan, begum husna siddiki sahit purv saansadon, purv vidhayakon or baari sankhya main basapa ke kaaryakartaaon congress party main shaamil hue
 Attempting to divert attention, Gulam Nabi Azad said that the BJP will be blaming many leaders, many parties for diverting attention from 'modiji' in the coming days
 bataate chalem ki ek vakt tha jab nasimuddin siddiki basapa ke sabase bade muslim cheharaa maane jate the
 Uttar Pradesh Nasimuddin's hank was worth seeing under Mayawati's rule
 bispi ke brahman chehre satish chandra mishra ke saath nasimuddin ko jodakar mayawati ne muslim-brahman-dalit combination ko kabhi kamyaabi se aage badhaayaa tha
 But everything changed in May last year
 nasimuddin ko bahanji ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa
 She was dismissed from the party by Mayawati on charges of rigging ticket distribution in West UP
 nasimuddin or congress ke bich siyaasi khichdi kaaphi samay se pak rahi thi
 Nasimuddin has also met Rahul Gandhi twice
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki nasimuddin kii congress main entry ke peeche party ke upi incharge gulam nabi aaazaad ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 In fact, after the bjp's bumper victory in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the Congress is well aware of the party's poor condition in this biggest state of the country
 party ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii chadhaai mushkil najar aa rahi he
 The Congress has to face Modi at the Center and Yogi's pair in UP
 aise main vah tamaam aise netaaon ko apane chat ke neeche laana chaahati he jo uskaa haath majboot karenge
 In such a situation, in the political arithmetic of Uttar Pradesh with 18 percent Muslim population, Nasimuddin Siddiqui's arrival in the Congress also suits the Congress
 congress mahasachivapriyanka gandhi ke varanasi se pradhanmantri ke khilaaf chunaav nahin ladane ke peeche kai tark die ja rahe hai
 It was said earlier that Rahul Gandhi refused, saying that the tradition of Gandhi family not fighting against big leaders was laid by Nehru and should be followed
 magar kya yahi ek vajah he priyanka ke varanasi se naa ladane kii? to aisa nahin he, sutron kii maane to bispi pramukh mayawati kaa priyanka kii varanasi se ummidavaari par raji naa hona he, congress ke ranneetikaar lagaataar mayawati ke salaahkaaron se sampark main the ki priyanka gandhi ke varanasi main chunaav ladane kii haalat main unhen pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa sanyukt ummidavaar ghoshit kiya jaae
 There was talk to the socialist about this and Akhilesh Yadav also gave his silent consent
 magar itnaa jarur ishaara kiya tha ki yah sab mayawati ji ke haa karne ke baad hi sambhav ho saktaa he
 When she was approached by Mayawati, she turned around
 mayawati ne priyanka ko vipaksh kaa sanyukt ummidavaar banane se manaa kar diya
 Experts say that Mayawati felt that if Priyanka contested the elections from Benares, it would create an atmosphere in favor of the Congress in Purvanchal which could harm the alliance
 mayawati yah jokhim lene ke liye taiyaar nahin thi wo pehle hi saaf kah chuki hai ki congress bhi bijepi kii tarah hi dushman he
 Although attempts were made to convince Mayawati, she did not agree
 iske baad congress kii mahasachiv or purvanchal kii prabharee priyanka ko varanasi se waapas lautnaa padaa
 If we look at the candidate of Banaras coalition, interesting things emerge
 gathbandhan ne shalini yadav ko tikat diya he
 Shalini Yadav belongs to the family of former Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shyamlal Yadav

 magar jis din unhone congress chhod kar samaajawaadee party kaa daaman thama akhilesh yadav ne unhen banaras se gathbandhan kaa tikat thama diya
 Seeing the lack of talk, the Congress again made Ajay Rai a candidate from Varanasi
 2014 ke chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kul 5,81,022 vot mili the
 Narendra Modi defeated his nearest rival Arvind Kejriwal by about 3
77 thousand votes
 duusare sthaan par rahane vaale aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ko 2,09,238 vot mili
 While Congress candidate Ajay Rai got 75,614 votes, BSP got around 60 thousand 579 votes, SP got 45291 votes
 yani sapa-basapa or congress kaa vot jod de to 3lakh 90 hazaar 722 vot ho jate hai
 Meaning that the difference was the victory of PM Modi lags behind the combined vote bank of all parties
 sawaal is baat kaa tha ki jis tarah se sapa-basapa ne raibareli or amethi main apane pratyaashee na utaarne kaa faisla kiya he agar priyanka varanasi se chunaav ladati hai to kya unke liye bhi rasta khaali kar diya jayega, lekin is par bispi supremeo mayawati nahin maanin

 bharat or pakistan ke bich hue kargil yuddh ko 26 july ko 20 saal puure hone ja rahe hai
 But on Saturday, the then Army Chief General VP Malik (retd) said that the failure of surveillance and intelligence led to the infiltration of Kargil 20 years ago
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki 1999 main bhartiya sena ke saamne kya-kya chunautiyaan thim
 a program was organized to mark the 20 years of the victory of the Kargil War, in which the current Army Chief Bipin Rawat and many other retired military officers attended
 army chif bipin ravat ne kaha, us yuddh se liye gaye sabak ke baad bhartiya surakshabalon kii dushmano ko khoj nikaalane kii kaabiliyat or behatar hui he
 This has happened not only in Kargil but in the border areas adjoining Pakistan and China
 kaarykram se itar general bipin ravat ne kaha, hamane apni kaabiliyat ko or behatar kiya he taaki aisi ghuspaith dobaaraa na hon
 Today, we have uavs, Air Force equipment and quadcopter for surveillance
 ' general ravat se pehle tatkaaleen army chif general malik ne kargil yuddh ke vakt apane anubhav saajha karte hue khamiyaan or jamini hakeekat ke bare main bataaya
 He said, 'we lacked surveillance equipment
 itnaa hi nahin helicopters bhi dushman ke thikaanon kaa pataa laga paane ke laayak nahin the
 We depended only on the petrol party
 ' unhone kaha ki yah puri tarah intelligence kii naakaami thi or tatkaaleen atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kaa line of control (LOC) paar nahin karne ke aadesh ke baad chunauti or bad gai
 General Malik said, 'I told former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee not to speak publicly about (not crossing the loc)
 saath hi yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki is maamle main ham apane target hasil nahin kar paaenge
 Then we will have no option but to cross the line of control
 'general malik ne kaha ki south block main maine kai baar 'murajhaae hue chehre' dekhe
 But this did not happen at the forward posts
 unhone kaha, 'jab main south block main tha to meraa manobal ooncha nahin tha
 But when i met the security forces in the forward areas, my morale got very high
 'ye thim chunautiyanjameen par chunautiyon ko lekar general malik ne kaha, shuruyaat main isaki koi samiksha nahin hui ki pakistani sena kya kar rahi he or har koi yahi sochataa rahaa ki oonchi chotiyon par mujahiddeen yaa aatankwaadi hai
 On the battlefield, the army also adopted a strategy to fight the terrorists
 is vajah se shuruyaat main hamaare kaaphi jawan shahid hue
 He also said that there was a shortage of weapons, equipment, especially clothing worn at high altitude
 unhone aage kaha, 'lekin raajnneetik, sainya or kootnithik netritv ke kaaran ham sab in chunautiyon se paar paane main kaamyaab rahe

 That is, every big cinema chain is releasing the film in its one theater
 baarah baje ke sho ke liye booking bhi khol di gai he
 In Gujarat too, the issue of the film My Name Is Khan seems to be stuck
 ahmedabad samet rajkot, jamnagar or bhavnagar main film relies nahin ho rahi he magar surat or vadodara main film relies ho gai he
 In view of the opposition of VHP, the owners of Cinema Hall and multiplexes in these cities have decided not to release the film
 kuch din pehle viechpi ne bhi shivasena ke sur main sur milaate hue shahrukh khan ke khilaaf bayaan diya tha, nateeja multiplex or cinema maalik is maamle main koi jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 On the other hand, people are reaching the cinema halls in Kolkata to see the film My Name Is Khan, there is no opposition there, nor is there any thought about the opposition of Shiv Sena in people's minds

 ' bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani 10 april ko madhya pradesh ke sagar jile main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karne vaale the
 But at the last moment his tour was canceled
 iske nau din baad unhen khargon or ratlam kii sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar santosh karnaa padaa
 Advani wanted to contest elections from the state capital Bhopal
 unki yah ichha to puri hui nahin, ulate pradesh main unke chunavi daure bhi ek ke baad ek radd kiye ja rahe hai
 This much is clear that the bjp's central leadership intends to keep them away from the election campaign of the state
 isaki sambhavit vajah gwalior main pichley saal hui adwani kii sabha ho sakati he, jisamen unhone pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko narendra modi se bhi bade kad kaa bataa diya tha
 These questions are arising because Advani's name was also included in the 40 star campaigners scheduled for campaigning in the state, but the scenario has changed after the political drama over the Bhopal seat
 ab adwani ko prachaar ke liye pradesh bulaane kii ichhashakti yahaan ke netaaon kii nahin dikh rahi he
 Not only Advani, the veteran leaders of the state are also absent from the election campaign
 pradesh bijepi ke kuch padaadhikariyon ke mutabik adwani, kailash joshi, sunderlaal patwa or yahaan tak ki sushamaa swaraj jaise netaaon se kinaaraa karke pradesh ke netaa khud ko modi camp kaa vafaadaar sabit karne kii jugat main hai
 They do not want to label themselves the advani-shivraj camp
 jabase yah faisla hua he ki adwani bhopal se chunaav nahin ladenge tab se pradesh main modi-virdohi takaton ke liye jagah nahin rah gai he
 Now, there is more demand among the activists of Shivraj Singh Chauhan who have a strong campaign
 ab tak chouhan pradesh main lagbhag 150 chunavi sabhaayen kar chuke hai to narendra modi 11 sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 Sushma Swaraj has held rallies outside her constituency Vidisha, while Rajnath Singh has held five public meetings and Venkaiah Naidu has two public meetings
 party ke bujurg chehron ko yah mauka nahin mila he
 In this regard, a senior BJP leader says, "the central committee sets the schedule of star campaigners according to the demands of the party's candidates
" is baar chunaav main utarane ja rahe ummidavaaron ne prachaar ke liye kisi varisht netaa kii maang nahin kii thi
 Although some candidates and bjp's state unit wanted Advani to campaign in the state, but the final decision was to be taken by the central leadership
 ’’ is bare main pradesh bijepi ke pravaktaa hitesh bajpeyi kehete hai, ‘‘yahaan narendra modi or shivaraj singh chouhan kii sabase zyada maang thi
 That is why Modi held 11 meetings here despite a very busy schedule, while Chauhan is holding more than five election meetings every day
 ’’bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik party ab sangh ke mutabik chalanaa chaahati he or sangh nae netritv ko badhaava dena chahta he
 Change is the rule of life, it has to be understood by the elders of BJP

 Have you ever wondered why China always remains a shield for Pakistan and Pakistani terrorists? And why does Pakistan always favor China? Does China really love Pakistan and is China a real advocate of Muslims? If you feel like this at all, then see this disclosure before that
 kyonki is report ko padhane or dekhne ke baad aapako china ke do chehre nazar aaenge
 a face is one that protects Pakistan and its terrorists
 or doosraa wo, jo apane hi desh ke musalamaanon par zulm dhahaata he
 The persecution collapses and Pakistan remains silent
 hafiz china kaa yaar he
 Masood Azhar likes China
 daaud kaa china khyaal rakhata he
 These three favorite Chinese people appear to be Muslims by name
 to kya ye maan len ki china musalamaanon kaa himachati he
 So do we believe that when the Muslims are in danger? tab tab china unka rakshak banakar saamne aa jayega
 Muslims are almost all over the world
 kahin aksariyat main yani bahusankhyak hai
 So in some sense there are minorities
 zaahir he kshetrafal ke hisaab se china agar duniya kaa chauthaa sabase bade mulk he to yahaan bhi musalmaan hone chahie
 But have you ever seen Chinese Muslims? soch main padana laazim he
 Because many of us have not heard the news of Islam in China
 magar aisa nahin he ki china main musalmaan hai hi nahin
 Muslims constitute about one and a half percent of the total population of China
 yani 138 karod kii kul aabaadi main 2 se 3 karod musalmaan hai
 a country where the majority of the population simply does not believe
 vahaan itani badi aabaadi islam kii maanane vaali he
 So, the way China protects Pakistani terrorists from being declared international terrorists in the UN Security Council
 vaise hi kya wo apane mulk ke musalamaanon ke haq main bhi phikrmand rahata he
 The truth is that there is a lot of persecution of Muslims in China
 haal hi main isaki kai tasviren duniya ke saamne ai thim
 Yes, this is the reality of China
 duniya ke saamne jo pakistan or pakistani aatankiyon kii himaayat karata nazar aata he
 Nobody should be cheating from him that China is a champion of Muslims
 agar aisa hota to chini musalamaanon par china main kadam kadam par paabandiyaan naa lagi hotin
 The Chinese government has imposed many restrictions on the Muslims there
 unke lambii dadhi rakhane par pabandi he
 Wearing a mask is prohibited
 saarvajanik jagahon par namaaz padhane par pabandi he
 There is a ban on giving religious education to children
 laudspikar par azaan pukaarane par pabandi he
 Eating halal meat is prohibited
 or to or sarkari tivi channel dekhne kii bhi manaahi he
 Even the Chinese government decides what the Muslims living in their country will eat
 kya pienge
 What will you wear? kya pahanenge
 Overall, the Chinese government is trying to end the religious identity of the Muslims there
 magar traasadee ye he ki china main musalamaanon par ho rahe julmon sitam par kabhi koi charchaa nahin karata
 All the countries of the world are still keeping silence because this matter is related to China
 yuan kii report ke mutabik china ne shinjiyang praant main aise kai khufia camp bana rakhe hai
 Where more than 1 million Chinese Muslims have been imprisoned for raising their voice against the oppression of the government
 yahaan unki dharmik azaadi chin lee gai he
 And they are being forced to stay away from religious deeds
 or to or kaidakhaanon main unhen raashtrapati shi jinping se vafadari kii kasame khilaai jaati he
 But in spite of all this, no Islamic country raised its voice against China
 duniya main musalamaanon kaa maseehaa banane vaale aatanki bhi is atyaachaar par hoth sile baithe hai
 On one hand, China is torturing its Muslim citizens
 unki mazahabi azaadi chin rahaa he
 On the other hand, by raising the flag of Muslim support, they are protecting Pakistani terrorists from UN sanctions
 magar ab musalamaanon ke liye china kii is dohari niti par pehali baar awaz uthi he
 For the first time someone has attacked China on this issue
 or ye waar kisi or ne nahin america ne kiya he
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has put China in the dock for adopting a dual policy
 china apane ghar main lakhon musalamaanon ko pratadit karata he, lekin hinsak islamic aatanki samoohon ko sanyukt raashtra pratibandh se bachaata he
 China has arbitrarily detained more than 1 million Uigars, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province since 2017
 unhen tatkaal reeha kiya janaa chahie
 Recently, China itself claimed that 13,000 terrorists have been arrested in Xinjiang province since 2014
 pompiyo kaa ishaara saaf he
 China's dual policy will no longer work
 kyonki wo ek taraf to apane alpsankhyak musalamaanon par sitam karata he
 On the other hand, Islamic terrorists are saved

 i asked Suresh
 usne bataaya ki ve apane kai parijanon, jinke saath unka barason se vigrah chalata aayaa he, ke naam anek kalah-sandarbhon main kal raat baar-baar lete rahe
 His memory is playing with him

 They are not able to show their face to the nation! Even today, the whole day was spent on the lines of a Bengali 'chade' (shishu-song) mentioned by Ravindra - 'bisti pode tapur-tupur!' Listen to this dialect of Bangla, just tappur-tupur! Isn't this the same tone of a particular speed of rain? Did she not ring in our ears in the same word? Today translated another wonderful story of Bijji - 'gum Bade Re Bhai Gum Bade!'
 yah vicitra he ki urdu kaa sarvapriya shabd 'gam’ rajasthani main bhi he, lekin streeling main
 In Urdu, in Urdu poetry, what words did not make it burning! Ghalib said - kaid-e-hayat or Bando-gum, in reality, both are one, why should a man get rid of gum before death! ek aadhunik urdu kavi faij ahamed faij kaa bhashaayi amal dekhie ki urdu ghazal main ardhviram yaa coma naamak pankjuation kaa ve kaisaa istemaal kar rahe hai—‘game-hayaat ho rukhe-yaar ho yaa daste-adu / saluk jisase kiya hamane aashikana kiya!’or hamaare bijji ne apni kahani kaa ant kuch aise kiya he :'vakt ke saath kisi karishme se rai ke baraabar beej bhi gher-ghumer chhatnar vat-vriksh ban jaataa he
 Similarly, the three children of Sethji's mansion also became giddy and weeping young
 or gaajon-baajon ke saath vakt anusaar teenon ke byaah bhi hue
 The form of Sethani also declined with puberty
 sethji kii tond bhi saath paar dhalane ko ai
 All the three children got married and went on a rampage and continued to play five drums on each other in the chowk of the mansion
 seth-sethaani ke hont to abhole the, par antas ke pardo par in dholon kii pratigunj sunai padati rahi— gam badi re bhai gam badi
 
 
 Drums of gum! '
 he na adbhut! yah kahani padhenge to urdu vaale jaan jaaenge ki ham unke 'gam’ ko kis arth main istemaal karte hai or vah unke 'gam’ se kitna gurutar he
 It is not light enough for us to be able to enjoy it: Gum struck us, Gum killed you, kill this sorrow! hamaara gam kuch or he mitro! vah maarane kii nahin, sanjone kii cheez he
 PS: Bijji's voices are heard

 They are not coming
 suresh prajaapat raat ko rahata he, par pichley do dinon se chimnaraamji kaa evji hokar din ko bhi aa rahaa he or raat ko bhi
 In fact, Suresh is the cook of a large 'cook' of girls hostels running under Mahendra Babu's vivid scale women's school
 vah iske alaava koi bhi kaam maatr atirikt dhanoparjan ke liye karata he or uske 'cook’ main or vyakti-manovigyaan main bhi ek 'aar’ aa dhansata he
 He goes from 'cook' to 'crook'
 yahi to he 'metamorfosis’, kaayantaran, jiskaa 'bhuto na bhavishyati’ ankan franz kafka ne apni isi sheershak kii ek kahani main kiya he
 But Bijji is calling out every five-seven minute interval, "simple!" easy! easy!
 vijaydaan detha, nobel ke liye namit kathakarasaral nirmal kaa bada bhai he, par vah apni tarah kaa hi saral he, jo vakr ko bhi tapasya karne himalay bhej de! astu, bas agle kisi bhi kshan mere kamare, meri teble tak unki bulaahat sunai pad sakati he, 'saral!’ or yah bhi vicitra he ki bijji us dhwani-sataha par bolne main praaia: ekadam asamarth ho gaye hai jise ham baatcheet kaa, paraspar samvaad kaa yaa paas-paas baithkar batakahi karne kaa str kah sakate hai, lekin aawaaj dekar pukaarane ke maamle main unke gale main abhi khaasaa jor baaki he!

 Out of curiosity i went to the door of my room
 teen log the

 apni tahani jaisi patali or lacheelee kaaya ke kisi aage-peeche main doctor sahab kii najar mujh par pad gai
 He returned the remaining two gentlemen and brought them to my room, blaming the memory of the memory
 patalun main bina belt ke shart incert kiye rakhane vaale log mujhe asahneeya rup se beshaur lagate hai
 But he was the husband of some sister of Bijji's family, so i had to change my attitude as soon as Dr
 Sahib was introduced to him
 ''vaah sahab, bada acha saahitiyik kaary ho rahaa he
 
 
 ! " i was relieved when they stood up in such a manner
 alabatta, mere kamare kii seedhiyaan utarate dow
 i requested Bhimdan Detha, "doctor sir, i used to drink a cup of tea with me!"
 vah takreeban saadhe baarah baje vaala kissa shaayad kal darj karun
 Dr
 bhimdan detha ko asal main main kai dinon se yaad kar rahaa tha
 He is the one who has given me the treatment of my chronic disease 'sinusitis' by Dr
 ENT Endoscopic Surgeon of Sir Gangaram Hospital, Delhi

 Dr
 bhimdanji ne jor dekar kaha tha ki 'aap iskaa ilaaj karvaa len
 
 
 Because it can also turn into 'malignancy' when it gets worse

 The joys and sorrows of my treatment will be there once again, but Doctor Sir, let me tell you, the new symptoms which i am seeing in my top body, it seems that your fears have come true

 Suresh was eating food sitting on the couch

 Tiffin comes from his college mess

 Who says Bijji is sympathetic or feudalistic? One of his sons, from now on, will not take his name, has told me one of his habits fifty times before me

 suresh unke paas baitha unki peeth par haath pher rahaa tha
 Suddenly said, 'AC, fan, cooler

 maine baat puri kii, ''likhaa he, jaise hossain ke ghode moulik hai, vaise hi bijji kii in kathaon kaa unka rachaa har paath moulik he
 Just as Hussain had an incredible degree of authority over colors and their energetic proportions, so did Bijji in these legends on words and language, their rhythms, their public eclipse process and the unconscious unconscious memory of mankind Is right

 Deepak Sharma, the owner of Sharma Tea Shop, got very upset when people started trying to give him 500 old notes in exchange for tea, banana and butter

 sutron se yah jaankaree bhi haath lagi he ki paak adhikrut kashmir main jammu kashmir ke rajouri ke saamne paak ISI nirdeshit satellite phone kii lokation ko tres kiya gaya he
 In addition to Rajouri, there have been clues to direct the terrorists to the location of satellite phones from pok at 6 more places
 khufia sutron ke mutabik pioke ke sharadi or jammu kashmir ke uttari tangadhaar ke saamne bhi paak ke satellite phone ke jariye aatank ko badhaava dene kii jaankaree mili he
 Sources have also informed that Pakistan transmits encrypted information to the terrorists through this type of satellite phone so that these terrorists can carry out their assigned tasks
 ghati main is sayam takreeban 325 aatanki maujuud hai, haalanki is saal ab tak 210 se zyada aatankiyon ko suraksha balon ne oparation ol out main dher kiya he
 This is the reason why he is now trying to direct the terrorists present in the valley using satellite phones
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ne in sardiyon main bhi badi ghuspaith karaane kaa ek alag tareeke kaa plan taiyaar kiya he
 The Pakistani army and ISI have bought a special dress for terrorists, which will help the terrorists to come through the icy paths even in winter
 gauratlab he ki ghati main is samay sakriy 325 aatankiyon main 215 sthaneey aatanki or 110 pakistani aatanki hai
 According to the list of terrorists in the valley near 'aaj Tak', at present there are 148 foreign and local terrorists of Lashkar, the second number includes local and Pakistani terrorists of Hizbul, number 117
 jabaki jaish ke 40 aatanki is samay ghati main maujuud hai
 While the intelligence agencies are already vigilant about the temptation being received by the Islamic State in the country, Mukesh Kumar, a student of Kaimur district of Bihar, has recently received an offer to join the terrorist organization over phone
 bataaya jaataa he ki iske evaj main use moti rakam or duusari anya suvidhaon kaa pralobhan diya gaya
 According to the information, on Friday, this call came from mobile on 923320434463
 kol karne vaale nekhud ko pakistanibataya
 After the call, the scared student informed Kaimur Sadar police station
 police is maamle ko gambhirtha se le rahi he
 The police is checking the details of the mobile number from which the call came
 camoor police number dekhne ke baad ise prathamdrishtya pakistan kaa hi bataa rahi he
 Missed call, then the student made the call back, on the other hand, Mukesh Kumar told that when he got the call on his mobile, he could not receive it, but later when he returned the call on the number, the receiver receiving the call himself from ISIS Active member told
 usne mukesh ko sanghathan se judane kaa ofer diya
 SP Harpreet Kaur said that the police has started investigating the matter
 NDA ke raashtrapati ummidavaar ramnath kovind kaa jis tareeke se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne samarthan kiya he uske baad bihar main mahagathbandhan ke upar sankat ke badal chaane lage hai
 There is constant rhetoric between JDU and RJD
 ek or jahaan argedy ke netaa nitish kumaar ko lagaataar aade haathon le rahe hai
 At the same time, JDU is also responding to the statement of RJD leaders
 in sabake bich up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne donon dalon ke bich tanatani ko shant karne kii koshish kii he
 Tejashwi has said that the Grand Alliance in Bihar is as unbreakable and strong as the Himalayas
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar ke mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ke bich behatar samanvay he
 The judicious people of Bihar have given a historic majority in the form of immense support and infinite respect to the policies and programs of the Grand Alliance
 aise main ve is bahumat kii vajah se janata ke sarokaaron ke prati puri tarah samarpit va patibaddh hai
 They further say that BJP and its supporting institutions are not digesting their unity
 gathbandhan ke bhi kuch netaa vyaktigat hiton ko lekar anaavashyak bayaanbaji karte rahete he taaki khabaron main bane rahe
 a section of the bjp-backed media has been engaged in propaganda against the Grand Alliance since the day the Grand Alliance was formed
 shaayad hi koi aisa din ho jab unhone yah report kiya ho ki mahagathbandhan majboot he
 The Mahagathbandhan is united and dedicated to Bihar
 bijepi unka samarthan isliye nahin karti kyonki mahagathbandhan kaa vichaar unke sarokaaron ko puraa nahin karata
 They keep investing their energy in the bakery of eating the casserole due to the continuation of the Mahagathbandhan and the breakdown
 ve kehete hai ki sabaki pesheygat majaburiyaan yaa vaicharik manyataayen hoti hai or loktantr main iskaa bhi sammaan hona chahie
 Tejaswi said that there are some people in every party who keep their personal interests paramount by not supporting Mandate or public sentiment
 aise logon kii apnivyaktigat dharanaen or pidaayenhoti he jinhen ve media ke marfat dal or gathbandhan se jod dete hai
 However, this is not the case in reality
 media main kisi dal kaa mantavya keval uske aadhikarik pravaktaa hi de sakate hai
 They say that many letters have also been sent on behalf of the state president to all media establishments on behalf of his party
 usamen spasht rup se yah kaha gaya he ki keval namit pravaktaa hi party se sambaddh masalon par aadhikarik bayaan dene ke liye adhikrut hai lekin phir bhi us nivedan or soochna kaa paalan unke dwaara nahin kiya jaataa or wo apane pasand ke anaadhikrut vyakti se bayaan lekar use party kaa aadhikarik bayaan bataakar chalaa dete hai
 The media also needs chilli-masala, so run the statement of a person who is not nominated to speak on behalf of the party
 ve aage kehete hai ki kuch aise logon par party kii taraf se anushaasanamak karrwai hui he or aage se kisi ke ulanghan par bhi karrwai hogi
 They say that even if their party is a mass party, they will not compromise on discipline and will take action against anyone who tries to link one's personal intent and interest with the party's vote
 gathbandhan par bayaan dene kaa adhikaar kisi vidhayak yaa netaa ke bajaay sirf rashtriya adhyaksh ke paas surakshit he
 In any case, the issue related to the alliance is a matter of national presidents of the three parties
 aise main us par kisi prakaar kii tippanee karnaa shobhaneey nahin he
 If anyone has any kind of problem, it should be talked about on the platform rather than the media
 ve ise lekar atyant gambhir hai
 He further said that the Grand Alliance is strong and unbreakable like the Himalayas
 bihar jeetne kii bhaajapai manshaa kabhi puri nahin hone vaali he
 The Grand Alliance of Bihar is the most beautiful and positive chapter in the current politics of the country
 isi mahagathbandhan kii dein he ki november 2015 se lekar march 2017 tak desh aman chaiyn or bhaichaare se ji rahaa tha anyathaa upi chunaav ke baad se to puraa desh main araajaktaa or dehshat ke maahaul main hi ji rahaa he
 Who knows when a bunch of three people kill someone in the name of religion, food, dress or pseudo nationalism? The bjp-sponsored mob has turned democracy into a democracy
 isliye puure desh ke kshetreey dalon par vahaan kii nyaaypriy va amanpsand janata kaa bhi dabaab he ki wo bihar kii tarah mahagathbandhan karen or desh todane vaali phacist takaton ko parrast karen
 For those who are hoping to break the Grand Alliance, say this much that this dream is not going to be fulfilled
 2019 main bijepi ko haraane main mahagathbandhan kii sabase ahm bhoomika hogi
 To save the country and the constitution, they are trying to bring all egalitarian and socialist parties together

 After the end of the swearing-in ceremony at the Raj Bhavan, Nitish rejected the bjp's Manjhi government's charge of acting through remote control, saying the new government would take full responsibility and act independently and not with remote control
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar apane vivek se chalegi

 The Manjhi government will have no difficulty in securing a trust vote as it currently has the support of 124 mlas including four of Congress, one of CPI and two of independent mlas, including 117 JD (U) mlas including the Speaker in the 237-member Bihar Assembly

 If you want to become an identity in the fashion world, then take special care of these advice given by our experts along with studying from an institute
 ye adwise aapkophation kii duniyaamein nayaa mukaam dengi
 Identify changing trends: Trends change rapidly
 isliye agar aap apane kaam main sajag nahin he or bazaar par baraabar najar nahin banaae hue hai to jaldi hi paaenge ki aap is khel se baahar ho chuke hai
 So it is important that you know the market first and then the customer
 apane kshetra main hone vaale takneekee pragati se bhi acchhee tarah waakif rahen
 It should also have the ability to analyze these trends
 aaj jo fishan chalan main chaaya hua he, jaruri nahin ki vah kal bhi storon main kaayam rahe
 And the great thing is that nowadays market demand does not change gradually, it disappears suddenly
 agar ek din strip chalan main hai to ho saktaa he agle din color neon kaa fishan chal nikle or agle hafte neude sweater fishan main aa jaaen
 Similarly, the demand for leather pants starts in no time
 aapako har samay is pragati ke hisaab se khud ko apadet rakhane kii jarurat he ki paaramparik takanic or tareekon main kis tarah dinodin badlaav aa rahaa he
 Many students make the mistake of assuming that it is fashion to make fantasies or fantasies come true
 unhen samajhnaa chahie yah ek udyog he or har udyog kii tarah isamen bhi udyog kaa research or khiladinnon tathaa isse jude anya logon ke bare main gaharaai se jaankaree rakhana jaruri he
 Hard work is essential: The biggest difference between being unique and ordinary in the fashion industry is copying or working according to what someone says
 agar aap apana kaam kisi duusare ke kehane ke anusaar karenge, kisi dizin kii nakal karenge or khud sochna band kar denge to aapke kaam ko hajaaron duusare kalakaaron ke kaam se alag kaise kiya ja saktaa he, yani aapkaa kaam baakiyon jaisaa hi najar aayega
 The ability to be a successful entrepreneur means that you get out of the pre-built limits and don't blindly follow corporate orders
 khud par rakhen bharosa:chaahe nijee udhyam shuru karnaa ho yaa college main kisi project par kaam karnaa ho, dizinron ko apane kaam main paryaapt aatmavishvaas rakhana chahie or jarurat pade to us kaam ko logon ke saamne rakhane kii himmat dikhaani chahie
 Showing courage to take risks is an intrinsic quality that can only be talked about, but can never be taught in a fashion school
 jokhim lene se peeche na rahen:antat: yah aap par nirbhar karata he ki aap kitni dur jane yaa jokhim uthaane kii himmat dikhaa pate hai or apana makasad puraa karne ke liye kitni drudh ichha shakti rakhte hai
 Young designers who are stepping into the fashion industry should never lose courage while getting the first ramp walk or working for celebrity clients
 kaarobaar ke liye puunji kii vyavastha karnaa or udyog kii raajnneeti se nibatna pehali baar main mushkil lag saktaa he, par yaad rakhen ki yah aisa kshetra he, jahaan kai behtareen diziner khud bhi aisa anubhav kar chuke hai
 It is okay to work within your limits, sometimes do not be afraid to push your limits
 market research main samay kharch karen:agar aap sochate hai ki diziner apni hi duniya main simatakar safal ho sakate hai or unhen akhbaar padhgaye yaa shaam ko televijan par khabar dekhne kii koi jarurat nahin he to aap galat hai
 It is important for every designer to be well aware of the trends in the market, its economy and cultural trends and political scenario
 har safaldiziner ko deshi or videshibazar kii halchal or rujhaan se waakif hona chahie
 Love your daily work: You should love your work, only then you can expect that the other person will like your work
 aapke kaam main kuch chaunkaane vaali yaa hatprabh karne vaali baat honi chahie varanaa aapkaa kaam baakiyon kii tarah saadhaaran paridhaan banakar rah jayega
 There will be nothing new in it
 yah chaunkaane vaali baat tabhi aati he jab aap jo kuch kar rahe hai vah aapako bhi moh le or puure dil se use taiyaar karen
 You should not compromise in any way with the quality of your work
 sarvottam se len sabak:fishan ke student aam taur par yah galati karte hai ki ve khud ko samay se pehle hi paripakv or sabase zyada jaankaar samajhane lagate hai jabaki ve yathartwaadee banakar is bhram se aasaani se dur rah sakate hai
 If you have been in this industry for less than five years, then it would be good for you to keep your ego under control and listen carefully to the advice of your seniors
 aatmavishvaas acchhee baat he lekin ati-aatmavishvaas khatarnaak hota he jo swayan kaa hi nuksaan karata he or kariyar ke liye ghaatak siddh ho saktaa he
 Increase degree experience as well: Studying in fashion school does not mean that you do not need to learn anything now
 ulate yah seekhney kii shuruyaat he
 It is very important to learn from other's experiences, especially in the initial few years
 aapkosenior dizinron kaarigaron or shilpakaronke paas jaakar hameshaa kuch na kuch seekhney ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 You should know how successful people have achieved success and how to meet the challenges in the way of starting their work
 aapako apane andar sunne or apane se senior logon ke kaam ko gaur se dekhne kaa gun paidaa karnaa chahie
 You can take advantage of their experiences and move forward
 material ko jaane:ledar, les, fer, coton yaa silk
 Fashion students often spend an entire semester identifying different types of clothes
 agar ve yah sikh bhi jaaen ki falaan kapadaa kis tarah kaa he or use pahchaanane main koi galati na karen lekin ve yah nahin bataa paaenge ki yah kapadaa kahaan se aata he or or ise banaata koun he
 It is not enough to identify the necessary materials related to different types of clothing and fashion available in the market
 students ko yah bhi maaloom hona chahie ki use banane kii prakriya kya he or uskaa utpaadan kaise hota he
 The best way to know about clothes in depth is to gather information about his entire journey
 Practical experience is very useful
 aalsee or apane kaam main kam ruchi rakhane vaale student hi har tarah kii satahi jaankaree hasil karne ke liye vikipedia yaa google par nirbhar hote hai
 By knowing where the material you are using comes from and what it can be used for, you can be more efficient than fellow students who are clueless about the source and origin of clothing and other materials
 Huh
 kapadon or duusari jaruri saamagree ke bare main gaharaai se jaankaree rakhane se na sirf aap apane dizin ke liye sahi kapade or saamagree kaa chunaav kar sakate hai balki aap uske itihaas or saanskrithik mahatv ke bare main bhi jaankaree rakh sakate hai jo aapako atirikt aatmavishvaas detaa he

 The tribunal has stated that Ryder's sample found traces of potent PBA and DEBEA and the batsman admitted that he had consumed two supplementary bullets before the match
 anushaasan sanstha ne haalanki rider kaa yah paksh sweekaar kiya he ki unhen nahin pataa tha ki is utpaada main pratibandhit padaarth shaamil he or usne ise isliye liya, kyonki vah apane badhate vajan se pareshaan tha or isliye ise nahin liya ki vah maidan par apane pradarshan main sudhaar karnaa chahta tha
 The tribunal said that the cricketer, however, did not try to ascertain from the authorities whether the supplement was valid or not, while its label warned that it may contain substances which have been banned by some organizations
 tippaniyan Instead, the rider and his trainer collected information via the Internet and came to the conclusion that the product is safe
 panchat ne kaha ki peshewar khilaadi hone ke naate rider ko sambhavat: gaiyrkanoonee supplement lene se pehle adhik satark rahanaa chahie tha
 The tribunal feels that the sentence of six months suspension is appropriate
 yah pratibandh april se lagu hoga, jiske kaaran rider aktubar main dobaaraa khilne ke liye uplabdh rahenge
 Regarding the rider himself away from international cricket since February 2012, the tribunal said that the cricketer was found positive after the home match in March this year

 The disciplinary body, however, admitted Rider's side that he did not know that the product contained a banned substance and took it because he was upset with his increased weight and therefore did not take it in his performance on the field Wanted to improve
 panchat ne kaha ki is cricketer ne haalanki adhikariyon se yah jaanane kii koshish nahin kii ki supplement vaid he yaa nahin jabaki iske label par chetavanee di gai thi ki isamen kuch aise padaarth ho sakate hai, jinhen kuch sanghathanon ne pratibandhit kiya hua he
 The comments isaki jagah rider or unke trainer ne internet ke jariye jaankaree jutai or nishkarsh par pahunche ki utpaada surakshit he

 This ban will come into effect from April, due to which Rider will be available to play again in October

 BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own, while it has 336 allies with its allies
 bijepi ke alaava endie kii aisi 11 partiyaan or hai, jinhone loksabhaa main siten jiti hai, or inamen se shivasena or telugudesham party kii sankhya dahaai ke aankade main he
 Now that the demand for the formation of the cabinet has begun, the question arises as to how many allies will get a place in the Modi government and how much will they have in the cabinet
 modi sarkaar main sahyogi dalon ko shaamil karne par baatcheet kaa silsilaa jaldi hi shuru hoga
 According to sources, all the allies of BJP are likely to find a place in the Modi government
 sutron ke mutabik shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa lene ke liye 26 may ko dilli aaenge, or agar 26 ko hi shapathgrahan main sahyogiyon ko bhi shaamil karne kaa faisla liya jaataa he to isse pehle uddhav se baat ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu is coming to Delhi on Saturday, and will meet Modi
 tidipi ko ek cabinet or do rajyamantri mil sakate hai, or party ke varisht netaa ashok ganpati raju kaa naam aage chal rahaa he
 In view of the possibility of mid-term elections in Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party may also get a stake, while Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal from Uttar Pradesh can also be taken into the government as a Minister of State
 akali dal ekmaatr sahyogi dal he, jisane sarkaar main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya he, haalanki bijepi iske baavjood use sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa de sakati he
 According to BJP leaders, a formula is being worked out to give allies a place in the cabinet
 is formule se har sahyogi dal ke na sirf cabinet or rajyamantriyon kii sankhya tay kii ja rahi he, balki yah bhi tay ho rahaa he ki kis party ke kitne mantri banaae ja sakate hai
 According to the sources so far, according to the formula, a cabinet minister can be found on 13 mps of the Lok Sabha
 agar mantrimandal kaa aakaar chota kar sirf 50 kaa rakhaa jayega to har saat saansadon par ek mantri banegaa, jabaki 70 ke mantrimandal par yah sankhya paanch ho sakati he
 If Modi's cabinet is only 50, then it will be seen which party will get so much share
 telugudesham party ko loksabhaa main 16 siten mili hai, so, is lihaaz se uskaa sirf ek cabinet or ek rajyamantri banataa he, jabaki 18 siten hasil karne vaali shivasena ko ek cabinet or do rajyamantri mil sakate hai
 Although the Shiv Sena was given a higher stake in the Vajpayee government, but then BJP had 182 seats, and now BJP has 282 seats, so the share of allies will be reduced automatically
 is formule ke mutabik chalem, to sahyogi dalon main shivasena or tidipi ko chhod kisi anya dal ke saansad ko cabinet mantri nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Other allies include Lok Janshakti Party with six, Akali Dal four, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party three, and Apna Dal two, and Naga People's Front, National People's Party, PMK, Swabhimani Paksha and All India NR Congress
 Each seat has been received
 is tarah modi ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki loksabhaa main sankhyabal kam hone ke baavjood kya sahyogi partiyon ko kshetreey santulan or unke netaaon ke kad ke hisaab se mantrimandal main jagah milani chahie
 For example, according to a cabinet minister's formula on 13 mps, Ram Vilas Paswan with six mps cannot be made a cabinet minister, but given the likely success of the mid-term elections in Bihar, the bjp's impressive success with Paswan votes and Paswan's experience and seniority He can be made a cabinet minister
 modi ne dalit agenda par khaas dhyaan diya he, so, aise main paswan ke daawey ko nazarandaaz karnaa mushkil hoga
 Similarly, in Nagaland it will be difficult to ignore the claim of the ruling Naga People's Front since 2003, while former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma has won from the National People's Party

 nae yug ke netaa aditya ne shivasena kii paramparaagat 'samskruti' se duuri banaae rakhi he
 He is rarely seen at the traditional Dahi Handi ceremony, while his party is very enthusiastically involved in it
 isaki jagah cosmopolitan aakankshaon ke anuroop hi unhone party ke niyantran vaale biemasi (brihanmumbai nagarpalika) ko is baat ke liye prerit kiya ki vah un ilaakon main chhaton par party or raat bhar chalane vaali khan-paan kii dukaanon, restaurant kii ijaajat de, jahaan abhi tak in par pratibandh tha
 Contrary to the thinking of the bjp-led Devendra Fadnavis government — which opposed any change in 'nightlight' rules citing law and order — Aditya said that opening the city would increase revenue and make Mumbai more 'tourist friendly' 'can be made
 (haalanki party kaaryakarta bhram main hai, kyonki unhen ye samaj nahin aa rahaa ki aise badlaav se saanskrithik mulyon ko bachaae rakhane ke party ke nazariye par kis tarah kaa asar padegaa)
 Despite all this, Aditya Thackeray is moving forward and intelligently focusing on areas such as education, environment and social work, where he can connect directly with the youth

 It is reported that he had arranged the meeting of Father Uddhav Thackeray and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on October 30, which intensified the speculation that the Shiv Sena would go ahead in a common front against the BJP

 baalik vadhu kii anandi yani pratyusha apane jis bwoyfriend rahul raaj singh ke saath shaadi karne ja rahi thi vah pehle si hi shaadishuda he
 Surprisingly, along with Pratyusha, Rahul kept this thing hidden from his friends in Mumbai too
 rahul ne paanch saal pehle kolkata kii ek airhostess se shaadi kii thi
 Rahul's parents are also aware of this marriage
 ab yah baat saamne ai he ki rahul kii isi pehali shaadi kii khabar sun kar pratyusha sadame main thi
 Lawyer left Rahul's partner Neeraj Gupta has also pulled back from this case
 unhone shikaayat kii he ki unka muvakkil rahul raaj singh cese ke bare main unhen sach nahin bataa rahaa he or saath hi kai bate chupa bhi rahaa he
 He hid the biggest truth that he is married
 is baat kii pushti ek ladki ne bhi kii he
 In 2010, this girl named Heer Patel, lived on the fourth floor of the building on which she lived, Rahul lived on the fifth floor of the same building
 ek ladki ke saath
 This girl was none other than the same airhostess from Kolkata, who was mentioned by Rahul's lawyer Neeraj Gupta
 paise kamaane ke lieladakiyon ko fansaata tha rahulrahul agar sachmuch shaadishuda tha to sawaal yah uthta he ki uske gharavaalon ne bhi yah baat kyon chhupaai? kya mumbai main paise kamaane kaa rahul kaa yahi tarika tha? hir patel ke mutabik rahul ladakiyon ko pyaar ke jaal main faansata tha
 Then he used to get money from them and used to do Ayyashi
 hir patel ke mutabik rahul ne usase bhi film banane ke naam par 25 lakh rupee liye the
 But later when the film was not made and Heer asked for money, Rahul refused to give the money
 baad main hir ne police main report darj kii
 After this, Rahul gave two checks worth Rs 15 lakh and ten lakh
 magar baad main donon check bouns ho gaye or tab tak rahul hir kii building chhod kar kahin or bhaag chukaa tha
 One thing is constantly being said that Pratyusha's financial condition was not good
 usapar lakhon kaa karj bhi tha
 And the family members of Rahul claim that it was Rahul who was bearing the expense of Pratyusha
 ab aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki khud rahul kii kamai kaa zariyaa kya tha? uske paas paise kahaan se aate the? pichley paanch saalon kii baat karen to mata kii chaowkee or ganesh lila naam ke do serial ko chhod de to rahul ne chote yaa bade parde par or koi bada kaam nahin kiya
 The Power Couple was probably her last show
 phir rahul kii kamai kaa jariya kya tha? aakhir uske paas paise kahaan se aate the
 Rahul himself did not even tell his lawyer
 to kya rahul sachmuch ladakiyon ko dosti, pyaar or serial yaa filmon main kaam dilaane ke naam par unase paise anthta tha or unheen paison se apane shauk puraa karata tha? ye saare sawaal ab isliye uth rahe hai kyonki police kaa maananaa he ki inhen sawaalon main pratyusha kii maut kii asli vajah chuphi he
 The police is trying to find out that Rahul did not pretend to be friendship and love and then marriage even for money from Pratyusha too? rus ke raashtrapativladimir putinguruvar ko do din kii yatra parabharata rahe hai

 Continuing her decision to withdraw support from the UPA government, on Wednesday, Mamata said that a section of news channels is trying to create confusion by spreading 'false news'
 ’mamata ne fasebuk par jari apane post main kaha, ‘mujhe agar kuch nayaa kahana hoga to main aap sabhi ko sidhe taur par bataaungi
 i reiterate that the decision that we have taken is for the people, for the people and for the people and it is also in the public interest

 ’ pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata ne kaha, ‘maine hameshaa hi gaur kiya he ki janata ke hiton ke liye jab bhi koi nirnay hota he aisa varg nuksaan pahunchane or bhram kii sthiti paidaa karne kaa prayaas karata he

 Mamta said, 'the central government is teaching people dieting by providing only six cylinders per family per year at a discounted rate

 ' unhone sarkaar par naatak karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'mujhe pradhanmantri karyaalay kii taraf se koi soochna nahin mili thi, jabaki maine apane faisle ke vishay main congress pramukh sonia gandhi ko pehle hi bataa diya tha

 Sharad Pawar said that people are angry with the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra
 aise main keval pulavama hamale jaisi ghatana se hi maharashtra ke logon kaa mood badal saktaa he
 Pawar said that before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, there was anger among people against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki, pulavama main siarpief jawan par hue hamale ne puure paridrishy ko badal rakh diya, isliye ab maharashtra ke logon kaa mood pulavama hamale jaisi ghatana se hi badal saktaa he
 Sharad Pawar said this while addressing a press conference in Aurangabad, Maharashtra
 is dauraan pavaar ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unhone is saal farvari main hue pulavama hamale ko lekar poochtacha kii, to unhen is baat par shaq tha ki yah jaanboojhkar kiya gaya tha
 Pawar further said that i have worked in the defense and when i spoke to some officials, i suspected that the Pulwama attack was either deliberate or Pakistan might be behind it
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main isi saal 14 farvari ko aatankwaadi hamalaa hua tha jisamen siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, an air strike was carried out by the Air Force at the terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan, in which many terrorists were killed
 ise lekar sharad pawaal ne kaha ki balakot airstrike se modi sarkaar kii lokapriyata badi
 However, he further said that this magic of Modi government will not work in Maharashtra, because people are not satisfied with Fadnavis government
 aage pavaar ne kaha ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko nuksaan hoga
 He said that people's expectations from nationalists had increased, but the Maharashtra government did no such thing that Fadnavis would come back to power
 aage unhone congress or ensipi ke faisle par jor dete hue kaha, 'ham zyada se zyada dharmanirpeksh takaton ko saath laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We joined hands with Congress and now we are trying to bring Bahujan Vikas Agadi, Samajwadi Party and other small parties with us
 'pavaar ne aage ye bhi bataaya ki ensipi kii manshaa raaj thakare kii maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke saath aane kii thi, lekin congress iske liye taiyaar nahin thi

 GD Agrawalka died in AIIMS, Rishikesh on a hunger strike demanding a 'ganga Protection Management Act' to make the Ganga uninterrupted
 professor agarwal pichley 111 din se anshan par the or mangalvaar ko unhone jal bhi tyaag diya tha
 After which the administration forcibly picked him up and admitted him to AIIMS
 professor jidi agarwal ko swami gyaan swaroop sanand ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Who devoted their entire lives to ensure the avirulence of Ganga
 unki maang thi ki ganga kii sahaayak nadiyon par ban rahe panbizli pariyojnaon ko band kiya jaae or ganga sangrakshan prabandhan adhinium lagu kiya jaae
 He wrote several letters to the ministers and Prime Minister responsible for reviving Ganga
 haalanki, unke kisi bhi patr par sambandhit adhikariyon kii taraf se aisi pratikriya nahi ai jisaki unhen ummid thi
 In his third and final letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he wrote, "3

 On 2018, Union Minister Sadhviuma Bharati came to meet me
 unhone phone par nitin gadakari ji se meri baat karai, lekin pratikriya kii ummid aapse he
 That is why i did not give any reply to Ms
 Uma Bharti
 meraa yah anurodh he ki aap nimnlikhit chaar vaanchit aavashyaktaaon ko sweekaar karen jo mere 13 june 2018 ko aapako likhe gaye patr main soochibaddh he
 If you fail, i will sacrifice my life while continuing my fast
 "professor jidi agarwal kii piem modi ko likhi puri chittheeseva main,shri narendra bhai modiji, aadarneey pradhanmantri, bharat sarkaar, nai dilliadarneey pradhanmantri,gangaji se sambandhit maamalon kaa ullekh karte hue maine ateet main aapako kuch patr likhe the, lekin aapaki taraf se ab tak mujhe is sambandh koi pratikriya nahin mili he
 i was quite confident that after becoming Prime Minister, you would think seriously about Gangaji
 kyonki aapane 2014 chunaavon ke dauraan banaras main swayan kaha tha ki aap vahaan isliye aae hai kyonki aapako maa gangaji ne bulaayaa he- us pal mujhe vishwaas ho gaya ki shaayad gangaji ke liye kuch sarthak karenge
 Because of this belief, i waited in peace for the last four and a half years
 shaayad aapako maaloom hoga ki main pehle bhi kai baar gangaji ke hit main kaaryon ko lekar anshan kar chukaa hum
 Earlier, accepting the basis of my request, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided not only to stop all the activities going on on a big project like Lohari Nagpala (which was 90 percent completed) but also cancel it
 Had done it
 is kaaran sarkaar ko hajaaron karod kaa ghaataa bhi sahanaa padaa, phir bhi manmohan singh ji aage bade or gangaji ke hit main yah sab kiya
 Apart from this, the then government went ahead and declared Bhagirathi ji's stream from Gangotri to Uttarkashi as an eco-sensitive zone
 taaki gangaji ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakane vaali gatividhiyaan phir kabhi na hon
 i expected you to make special efforts for Gangaji by going two steps ahead, because you had formed a separate ministry on Ganga coming forward
 lekin pichley chaar varshon main aapaki sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye sabhi kaary gangaji ke liye to laabhakaari nahin rahe, lekin unke sthaan par keval corporate kshetra or vyavsaayik gharaanon kaa laabh dekhne ko mila
 Till now you have only thought on the issue of making profit from Gangaji
 gangaji ke sambandh main aapaki sabhi pariyojnaon se dharna banati he ki aap gangaji ko kuch bhi nahin de rahe hai
 Even as a mere statement you can say that Gangaji has nothing to do with them but they have to give something from our side

 2018 ko kendriya mantri sadhvi uma bharti ji mujhase milane ain thi
 They made me talk to Nitin Gadkari on the phone, but expect a response from you
 isiilie maine sushri uma bharti ji ko koi jawaab nahin diya
 i request that you accept the following four desired requirements which are listed in my letter to you on 13 June 2018
 yadi aap asafal rahe to main anshan jari rakhte hue apana jivan tyaag duungaa
 i will have no hesitation in giving up my life, because the issue of Ganga-ji is very important and very primitive for me
 main iaiti main professor, kendriya pradooshan niyantran board kaa sadsy hone saath gangaji par bane sarkari sanghathanon kaa sadsy rahaa hum
 On the basis of my experience earned over the years due to being a part of these institutions, i can say that not a single task done to save Gangaji in the four years of your government can be called fruitful
 meraa aapse anurodh he, main doharaata hum, ki nimnlikhit aavashyak kaaryon ko sweekaar kiya jaae or kriyanvit kiya jaae
 i am sending this letter through Umaji
 aavashyak kaaryon ke liye mere chaar anurodh is prakaar hai:1
 The draft Bill, prepared by the Ganga Mahasabha in 2012, should be brought to Parliament immediately and passed (I, Advocate MC Mehta and Dr Paritosh Tyagi were among the committee to prepare the draft)
 yadi ye nahin ho paae to is masauda vidheyak ke chapter 1 (anuchhed 1 se anuchhed 9) par adhyadhesh laakar tatkaal raashtrapati se manjuuri dilaate hue lagu kiya jaae
 2
 uparyukt kaary ke hisse ke rup main alaknanda, dhauliganga, nandakini, pinder or mandakini par nirmaanadhin sabhi panbizli pariyojnaon ko radd kiya jaae
 Along with this, all proposed hydroelectric projects to be built on Ganga and all the streams that feed them should also be canceled
 3
 Article 4 (D) -1 deforestation of the draft Bill, 4 (F) killing / processing of living species and 4 (G) all kinds of mining activities should be completely stopped and implemented
 ise haridwar kumbh kshetra main visheshkar lagu kiya jaae

 june 2019 tak ganga bhakt parishad kaa gathan kiya jaae jisamen aapke dwaara namit 20 sadsy hon, jo gangaji ke pani main shapath le ki ve gangaji or keval gangaji ke anukool hiton ko laabh pahunchane ke hit main hi kaary karenge or gangaji se sambandhit sabhi kaaryon ke sambandh main, is parishad kii raay nirnaayak ke rup main lee jaaegi
 Since i did not get the reply to the letter sent to you on 13 June 2018, i started my fast from 22 June 2018 as i have written in this letter

 agarwal) This time the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha will not come from the Congress
 spikar sumitra mahajan ne niyamon kaa hawala dete hue netaa vipaksh se judi congress kii maang ko naamanzoor kar diya
 Specker said of his decision, 'I have studied the rules and traditions
 ' yah faisla karne se pehle spikar ne atorni general mukul rohtagi kii raay bhi lee
 Rohatgi said that the Congress does not have the necessary numbers in the House to give it the status of Leader of the Opposition
 spikar ke is faisle ke bare main congress ko patr likh kar bataa diya gaya he
 Significantly, Congress President Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Mahajan, requesting Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to be given Leader of Opposition status in the Lok Sabha
 niyamon kaa havalaspikar ne niyam 121 kaa hawala dete hue congress se kaha he ki vah is sthiti main nahin hai ki sadan main party ke netaa ko netaa vipaksh kaa darja de saken
 To get this status, a party in the 543-member Lok Sabha has to have at least 10 percent of this number i
e
 55 seats
 samajha jaataa he ki apane is faisle ke sandarbh main sumitra mahajan ne 1980 or 1984 ke udaahranon kaa bhi hawala diya jab loksabhaa main kisi vipakshi dal ke paas yah sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran kisi ko netaa vipaksh kaa darja nahin diya gaya tha
 Significantly, Congress is the second largest party in the current Lok Sabha with 44 seats
 282 siton ke saath bijepi sabase badi party he
 Asked by the legal cell, Khargekhgade said on the speaker's decision that he would take the opinion of the Congress high command and the party's legal cell before saying anything about it
 unhone kaha, 'manyata praapt netaa vipaksh hona ek baat he or floor leader ke rup main kaam karnaa duusari baat
 ' sachin tendulkar or major dhyanchand main se khel main bharat ratna ke pehle daavedaar ko lekar chhidi bahes ke bich star nishanebaaj gagan naarang or abhinetri deepika padukon ne kaha he ki donon ko hi desh kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan diya ja saktaa he

 china sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi project china-pakistan iconomic coridor(sipiisi) na sirf bharat kii samprabhutaa ke liye khatra paidaa kar saktaa he balki is project se pakistan kii haalat bhi greece jaisi ho sakati he or vah raajnneetik or aarthik taur par china ke adheen ho jayega
 Rating agency Moody's Investors Service has cautioned against the rising government debt of Pakistan, saying that the external debt of Pakistan will increase to $ 79 billion by June this year
 daily times ne agency ke hawaale se kaha he ki badhate karj ke kaaran desh kivitiya sthitikamjor hogi or karj vahan karne kii uski kshamta par asar padegaa
 Karachi-based economists in Pakistan claim that the CPEC, prepared under China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) project, will subject Pakistan to China politically and economically
 pakistan ke pramukh arthshaastri kaisar bengali ne daawa kiya he ki is project main shaamil hone se pakistan kii sthiti bhi greece jaisi ho sakati he jahaan vah apane karj ko chukaane ke liye nae karj ke chakra main funs gaya he
 In such a situation, Pakistan will become financially completely subordinate to China
 gauratlab he ki apni naveenatam report main mudies inwestors sarvice ne bhi kaha he kipakistanke samaksh chunautiyon main ucch sarkari rin boj, kamjor bhautik va saamaajik buniyadi dhaancha, kamjor bahya bhugtan sithati tathaa ucch raajnneetik jokhim shaamil he
 At the same time, the Chinese government has decided to increase its investment in Pakistan's CPEC
 haal hi main china ne is project ke tahat pakistan main prastaavit nivesh ko 46 billian dollar se badhaakar 62 billian dollar kar diya he
 Under this project, the Chinese government will build an industrial park, railway and road network to connect Pakistan's Guadar Port with Jinjiang Province
 july-june 2016-17 ke aakhir tak pakistan kaa bah rin badhkar 79 arab dollars ho jayega jisamen saarvajanik kshetra kaa hissaa 77
 7 billion dollars
 maujuuda vitt varsh ke liye ukt anumaan state bank aaf pakistan dwaara jari pehle ke purvanumaan se kahin adhik he
 The central bank had said that the total external debt and liabilities stood at 74 by the end of December 2016
 2 arab dollars ho gai
 Therefore, the investment under CPEC in these figures could lead Pakistan to an economic situation where it would need more debt to repay its debt and this situation would be enough to make it Greece

 The court said that 'it has no power'
 nyaayamurti pies teji ne kaha, 'mukhya metropolitan magistrate ke samaksh adaalat kii kaarywahi sthagit karne ke yachikakarta ke anurodh ko khaarij kiya jaataa he, kyonki isamen dam nahin he or maujuuda yachika khaarij kii jaati he'
 The court said, "nothing has been presented before this court which suggests that the criminal proceedings before the CMM are misuse of legal process and this court order is required for justice"

 ucch nyaayalay ne kejariwal ke us anurodh par 25 july ko apana faisla surakshit rakhaa tha jisamen nichali adaalat ke 19 may ke aadesh ko chunauti di gai thi
 Justice PS Teji said, 'the petitioner's request for adjournment of the court proceedings before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate is rejected as it has no merit and the existing petition is dismissed'
 adaalat ne kaha, 'is adaalat ke samaksh kuch bhi aisa nahin pesh kiya gaya, jisase yah lage ki siemem ke samaksh faujadaari kaarywahi kanoonee prakriya kaa durupyog he or nyaay ke liye is adaalat ke aadesh kii aavashyaktaa he'
 The court said that 'this court is of the opinion that the order of 19 May 2016 of the CMM, which asked for continuation of proceedings, is free from misconceptions, impropriety, illegality and non-maintainability
 isliye adaalat siarpisi kii dhara 482 ke tahat antarnihit adhikaar kshetra kaa istemaal karne par majaboor nahin he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke anya paanch netaaon ke khilaaf jetali ne yah cese daayar kiya tha
 He was publicly accused of corruption
 kejariwal ne jetali ko didisie main kathith bhrashtachar main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha

 It is not possible to separate Kashmir from dialogue
 ’’ kuraishi ne kaha ki jammu or kashmir, shanti or suraksha tathaa siachin jaise buniyadi masalon ko nazarandaaj karke saanskrithik or vyapaarik rishton par baat karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 He said, "we understand their concerns and want to address them as well, but Pakistan also has concerns, which they (india) have to address
" ’’ kuraishi ne kaha ki koi gatirodh nahin he, lekin saath hi yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki ‘‘ dikkatein or mushkilen hai, jinhen dono pakshon ko dur karnaa hoga
 He said, "there has been a tendency of india-pakistan dialogue that whenever there is any progress, there is always a hesitation in the last moments
 pakistani paksh se koi hichak nahin he
 "according to the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Krishna had said that he was ready to talk on all the issues, but" we wanted that at the end of the conversation we had a blueprint for future talks and he thought that to make such a promise They do not have an order for
 ’’kuraishi ne jor dekar kaha ki bharat baatcheet ko simit kar rahaa tha or pakistan ne spasht kar diya ki ‘‘baatcheet main aap chuninda nahin ho sakate
 He said issues have already been identified between India and Pakistan that are part of the eight rounds of the four-year composite dialogue
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ agar vah unheen muddon tak simit rahanaa chaahate hai to yah pakistan ke liye mushkil hoga
 Satisfying Krishna, Pakistan's Foreign Minister said that he did not go out even once to talk on the phone during the conversation, but instructed the Indian Foreign Minister about foreign policy from New Delhi by staying during the meeting
 Continued to meet ’unhone kaha, ‘maine pakistani dal kaa netritv kiya or dinabhar kii baatcheet ke dauraan mujhe pakistan ke netaaon ko ek baar bhi phone karne kii jarurat nahin padi
 Krishna is the leader of those who decide foreign policy, so why were they being instructed from Delhi repeatedly
 ’kuraishi ne kaha ki bhartiya paksh kal kii baatcheet main ‘chuninda’ rahaa haalanki april main bhutan main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon ke bich hui baithak kii bhaavana se yah baat mail nahin khaati kyonki unhone tamaam muddon par baat karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The Pakistani Foreign Minister said, "progress in negotiations can only happen when we move forward on all subjects simultaneously
" agar ham keval unheen muddon ko tavajjo denge, jinhen bharat ahmiyat detaa he or pakistan ke hit ke muddon ko darkinar kar denge to ham chizon ko aage nahin badha sakate
 He said that there are problems in bilateral relations and both countries will have to find a way to overcome them
 unhone kaha, ‘ham har samay or har jagah baat karne ko taiyaar hai or hamen koi jaldi nahin he
 We will wait till they are ready
 ’ kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan baatcheet ke nattejey ke taur par bhavishya ke liye ek khaakaa chahta he, lekin bhartiya paksh kaa khyaal he ki unke paas aisa koi vaada karne kaa aadesh nahin he
 He said, 'india is restricting dialogue and we say you cannot be selective
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham bharat kii chintaaen samajhate hai or unhen dur karnaa chaahate hai, lekin pakistan kii bhi chintaaen hai or buniyadi mudde hai, jinhen bharat ko samajhnaa chahie
 The Pakistani foreign minister said, "pakistan is ready to negotiate, but the talks should be concrete, meaningful and result oriented
" pakistan kii janata or kashmiriyon ko jammu or kashmir ke halaat se alahada nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, "there is no hesitation from Pakistan
 main kisi bhi mudde par baat karne ko taiyaar hum
 "asked if there was any impediment in yesterday's talks, Qureshi said," i will not call it a hindrance, but i will say that Pakistan's attitude was strong and constructive and we wanted to move forward
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ne bharat ko vishwaas behaal karne or avishvaas kii khai paatane ke liye uthaae jane vaale kadamon kii jaankaree di
 He stressed that a number of issues were agreed upon, on which progress could be improved by the environment
 kuraishi ne kaha ki buudhvaar kii raat anaupchaarik raatri bhoj ke dauraan krishna ke saath unki baatcheet bahut safal rahi, lekin ek din baad aupchaarik baatcheet main chijen badal gayi
 He said, 'I think India is not ready at the basic level
 ’kuraishi ne spasht kar diya ki pakistan kashmir ke masale par apni aitihaasik sthiti se peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin he
 During the conversation with Krishna, he stressed that the elected government of the state will deal with human rights violations and law and order problem in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘yah pehle hi tay ho chukaa he ki kashmir hamaari baatcheet kaa hissaa he or yah ek vivaadit kshetra he
 If it is said that the people of Pakistan and Kashmiris (of Jammu and Kashmir) are separated from the internal situation, then it is not possible
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan par najar rakhane ke liye bharat main tantra ho sakate hai, lekin agar kanoon or vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye sena ko tainaat kiya jaataa he, kai shaharon main karfu he, puure jammu or kashmir main hadtaal ho rahi hai or begunaah log prabhavit ho rahe hai, to pakistan alahada kaise rah saktaa he
 'he said,' The Government of India Occupied Kashmir is also looking at this conversation with hope and hoping for progress in it because it understands the problems it is going through at the moment
 ’ pakistan ke videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye pakistan bhi utana hi taiyaar he, jitna bharat, kyonki pakistan bhi is laanat kaa shikaar rahaa he
 Qureshi also refuted Krishna's claim that Pakistan had not provided any evidence related to India's alleged role in promoting instability in Balochistan
 unhone kaha ki vah guuruuvaar ke samvaadadaata sammelan main is vishay par isliye chup rahe kyonki vah mejabaan the or krishna unke mehmaan the
 He said, 'according to my information our Home Minister has spoken to the Home Minister of India about this and Krishna should know about this

 ) At several mid-day gates of the country's capital, Delhi, a jam can occur at midnight on Friday
 vajah hogi dilli kii seemaa ke andar pravesh se pehle hi lagane vaali commercial vaahanon kii betahasha bheed
 The crowd will range from taxis to trucks and buses that have not yet installed radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, ignoring the warning given several days ago
 in rfidi tag ke bina vyaayavsayik vaahanon kaa rajdhani kii simaaon main shuukravaar raat se pravesh purnat: pratibandhit hoga
 The Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (the nodal agency of RFID tag) had been promoting commercial vehicle drivers and their owners several days in advance
 ise lagu karne se pehle dilli nagar nigam ne kuch mohalat bhi di thi
 Even after this, if this tag is not found on the vehicles, then in any case they will not be allowed to enter the border of the national capital
 bataa den ki dilli kii simaaen kai ore se uttar pradesh va haryana se lagati hai
 There is a possibility of jam due to increase in congestion of vehicles without tag at these limits
 isse sabase zyada pareshaani un nijee vaahan chaalkon ko uthaani padegi, jo raat ke samay rajdhani main pravesh karne vaale hai yaa shahar se baahar jane vaale hai
 a South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said, "so far (around one o'clock on Friday day) around two lakh RFID tags have been sold
 bike hue tags kii yah sankhya har raat dilli main pravesh karne vaale commercial vaahanon kii sankhya se bahut kam he
 It is therefore believed that there is going to be an increase in congestion of untagged vehicles near Delhi's borders
 is jam se jahaan sabhi vaahan chaalak pareshaan honge, vahiin toll karmiyon ko bhi bina tag vaale vaahanon kii bheed se jujhna padegaa
 This crowd can also get vehicles tagged
 jam lagane kii sambhaavna se dilli nagar nigam ke aalaa-afasar bhi inkaar nahin kar rahe hai
 "the sources of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which have been made the nodal agency for tag arrangements, show that if the congestion increases, there is also a way to give entry of vehicles without tag for a few days by charging 10 times more fine, which will get rid of the jam
 Will be helpful in getting it
 dilli nagar nigam ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki in tag ke lagane se toll-booth par bheed nahin lagegi, jisase eendhan kii bachat to hogi hi, saath hi pradooshan par niyantran paane main bhi kaaphi madad milegi
 With this, the task of collecting toll tax will also become easier
 maujuuda samay main toll booth par ek vaahan se toll vasuulne main teen se paanch minute lagate hai
 There will also be considerable time savings after tagging

 dhoni ne iske saath hi saaf kiya ki madhyakram main paanchaven sthaan par gurkirat singh maan yaa manish pandey main kisi ko utaara ja saktaa he
 He said, "only number five is in which i can take them down, because if i send them to number six, on good days they can score more than 30 and on bad days they will only score 10
" is tarah se 15 maichon ke baad unka score 15 ke aasapaas rahegaa or media sawaal karnaa shuru kar degaa ki is khilaadi ko kyon nahin hataaya ja rahaa he
 "it is difficult to bat at the number six and seven positions and i don't remember more than two or three players in the history of Indian cricket who have been successful in these places," Dhoni said
 upmahadweep main unhen ballebaaji kaa adhik mauka nahin miltaa
 Only here, he can get a chance to bat when the wicket falls

 dhoni ne kaha, number chah or saat pojishan par ballebaaji karnaa mushkil hota he or mujhe bhartiya cricket ke itihaas main do yaa teen khilaadiyon se zyada yaad nahin he, jo in sthanon par safal rahe hon
 In the subcontinent, they do not get much chance of batting
 keval yahaan shuru main wicket girane par unhen ballebaaji kaa mauka mil saktaa he

 fc) on May 13, 2016 at 10:51am PDT The Congress today slammed the BJP for constantly pushing for a 2G spectrum scam to be investigated by the JPC
 usne kaha ki vipakshi party is mudde par sansad ko baadhya karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 At a rally organized by Congress MLA GS Bali at Nagrota in Kangra district, party general secretary Mohsina Kidwai said, 'the minority opposition is trying to force Parliament on this issue which is harmful to democracy
 ’ Amit Shah said that article 14 was first questioned
 yah bill kyon? ke jawaab main amit shah ne kaha ki yah bill (CAB) kabhi na laana padataa agar is desh kaa bantwaaraa nahin hua hota
 This bill had to be brought due to the problem arising due to the partition
 agar pehle koi sarkaar yah bill laati to abhi ise laane kii jarurat nahin hoti
 There is no election tomorrow
 desh kii samasya ko kab tak taala ja saktaa he?amit shah ne kaha ki narendra modi kii sarkaar satta bhogane ke liye nahin samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye ai he
 He said that after intervening between Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal Ji, i am again saying that if the country had not been divided on the basis of religion, there would have been no need to bring this bill
 amit shah ne kaha ki 1950 main nehru-liyakat samjhauta hua
 It promised to ensure complete independence in our country with minority communities
 vahaan kai tarah kii paabandiyaan daal di gayi
 Here Muslims occupied many important positions
 bharat ne apana vaada nibhaayaa lekin vahaan (pakistan) kya hua?shah ne kaha ki jinhone jakhm lagaae vahi sawaal puch rahe hai
 i wonder that those people are asking questions today
 yah pehali baar nahin he, naagarikta sanshodhan pehali baar nahin hua he
 Even before this, bills were introduced to solve different problems
 aaj bhi bharat se jude teen deshon ke dharmik alpsankhyakon kii samasyaon ko sulajhane ke liye bill laayaa gaya he
 Before this, bills were introduced for granting citizenship to refugees from many countries, then why was it not done for refugees from Pakistan? Amit Shah said that i do not need to divert attention
 ise raajnneetik najariye se na dekhen
 We win elections on our own work and on the strength of our leader
 ek sawaal kiya gaya ki isamen muslim kyon nahin hai? yah bill pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan ke alpsankhyakon ke liye he jo vahaan dharm ke aadhaar par pratadit hokar bharat aae
 During the last five years under Modi's rule, 566 Muslims of these three countries have been given citizenship here
 amit shah ne kaha ki hamaari vyakhya he ki jo alpsankhyak he uske liye yah bill he
 Do you believe that if they are Muslims then only they will be secular? He said that we have included all the creeds, religion believers among the minorities there
 amit shah ne kaha ki yah bill artical 14 samet samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed kaa ulanghan nahin karata he
 Shah said that we are not afraid of going to someone's court
 yah kanoon vahaan bhi sahi hogi
 India honored the Muslims of India
 inaki naagarikta ko koi samasya nahin he
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Amit Shah said that do politics but do not create discrimination in the country by doing this
 unhone kaha ki congress ne bhi ise maanane kii baat duharai thi lekin ab virodh kyon kar rahe hai? gandhi ne apni prarthana main kaha tha ki pakistan ke hindu or sikh jo yahaan aana chaahate hai aaen or bharat sarkaar unke liye sabhi tarah kaa intjaam karegi
 Gandhiji has said such things only for Hindus and Sikhs
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi is samasya kaa zikr kiya tha or samaadhaan kii apil kii thi
 Amit Shah said that the Narendra Modi government believes that the nehru-liaquat agreement should be respected
 amit shah (amit Shah) ne kaha ki tu nesan theory saavarkar kii he yaa nahin, main isko chalange nahin karata
 Jinnah demanded the partition of the country but the Congress agreed, why? Derek o'brien said that it is being misinformed that Durga and Saraswati have to go to court for immersion
 amit shah ne kaha ki naaji or germany kaa zikr kiya gaya lekin yahaan loktantric prakriya ko kabhi nahin roka gaya
 Except emergency time, the public rejected it too
 amit shah ne kaha ki hardam ek samasya ko hal karne ke liye bill laayaa gaya isliye tamilnadu ke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya gaya he
 Amit Shah referring to Sanjay Raut said that how people change color for power
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa main shivasena ne samarthan kiya lekin ek raat main aisa kya hua ki shivasena ne apana stand badal liya
 In response to the question of RJD MP Manoj Jha, Amit Shah said that the Congress had not given up the hellish life of refugees for 70 years, Narendra Modi gave it to him
 kapil sibbal ke sawaal ke jawaab main amit shah ne kaha ki dharmik aadhaar par utpeedan kii kahaniyaan akhabaaron ke hawaale se, kai rirpoton ke hawaale se aap dekh sakate hai
 This bill is a bill not to take citizenship and it has nothing to do with Indian Muslims
 shah ne kaha ki mujhe koi na samajhaae, meri saat pushtein yahi janmi hai or main bhi yaheen janma hum or yaheen maruunga
 Amit Shah said that the only religion of the Narendra Modi government is the Constitution
 use sunishchit karana meraa kaam he or main use karuunga
 Amit Shah referred to the agreement reached in Assam in 1985 and said that the culture, language, literature and natives of the Congress never took initiative for its culture
 yah sirf kaagajon main rahaa
 The Narendra Modi government implemented
 amit shah ne kaha bill ko lekar congress bhram nahin failaae
 He said that the statements of the Congress leaders and the statements of the leaders of Pakistan get mixed up many times
 kal hi pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne jo bayaan die or jo aaj sadan main congress ke netaaon ne bayaan die wo ek se hai
 The statements Imran Khan made on the Citizenship Bill and the statements of Congress leaders today are from one
 amit shah ne poocha ki congress ne anemi bill kaa virodh kyon kiya tha? uskaa koi justification he?unhone kaha ki pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan main hinduon par atyaachaar hue
 People fled from there to India
 afghanistan main hinduon ko apane ghar par pilaa kapadaa lagaana hota he
 Women also have to do the same
 amit shah (amit Shah) ne teenon deshon main alpsankhyakon par hue hamalon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki ise record par rakhaa janaa chahie
 He said that there has never been any injustice done to followers of any religion in our country
 ham apane desh ke liye kanoon bana rahe hai
 There is no provision to make anyone sad
 yah adhikaar dene kaa bill he lene kaa nahin
 Earlier, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that no Muslim is afraid of you, we are afraid only of the Constitution
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bill pesh karte samay ek baat kahi gai thi jis par mujhe sakht aapatti he
 You said that the Muslims of the country need not fear
 mujhe is par aapatti he
 No Muslim is afraid of you
 main is desh kaa naagarik hum, aap se nahin darataa hum
 i am afraid only of the constitution
 desh kaa musalmaan darataa he to sirf samvidhan se
 Taking a dig at the BJP, Kapil Sibal said that we know what your goal is
 ye main 2014 se jaan rahaa hum
 Removal of Article 370, three divorces, CBC, NRC and then NRC
 
 
 sab pataa he
 You want to recognize people by their names
 isse pehle naagarikta sanshodhan bill par shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut ne sadan main kaha ki jo bill kaa samarthan karenge wo desh bhakt honge or jo nahin karenge wo deshadrohi honge, ye maine padhaa he
 Also read that those who are opposing the bill are speaking the language of Pakistan
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ye pakistan kii sansad nahin he, ye bharat kii he
 Our strong Prime Minister, our strong Home Minister, there is great hope from you
 jis skool main aap padhate hai ham uske master hai
 And Balasaheb was the headmaster
 ham sharnaarthiyon ko sharan de rahe hai to ghuspaithiyon ko nikaalnaa chahie
 We must accept them on the basis of humanity
 us par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
