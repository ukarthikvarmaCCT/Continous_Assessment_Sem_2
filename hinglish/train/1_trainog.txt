 However, such cases are rarely found
 ek nurse ne kaha ki uske paas ek sidi he
 a CD in which a cabinet minister and an MLA is imprisoned naked
 or agar yah sidi aam ho gai to teen din ke andar rajya kii sarkaar gir jaaegi
 But before this CD became common, the nurse herself disappeared
 yah kahani he, bhavari devi kii jisane rajasthan ke siyaasi galiyaaron main bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 Who was Bhanwari Devi Bhanwari Devi was from the Nat fraternity of Rajasthan
 vah jodhpur ke najadik pinen kasbe ke ek sarkari aspataal main bataur nurse kaam karti thi
 He was also married
 par modelling or rajasthani album ko seedhi bana kar vah rajasthani filmon kii heroin banane kaa sapana paale baithi thi
 So she could do anything to fulfill her dream
 gaanv ke aspataal main le dekar ek hi vahi nurse thi or wo bhi duty se gaayab rahati thi
 Therefore, on the complaint of the villagers, Bhanwari Devi was suspended from her job
 karti thi sarkaar giraane kaa daawabhanvari devi ne elaan kiya tha ki uske paas ek sidi he
 After coming out, the government of Rajasthan will fall in three days
 aakhir kya tha us sidi main ki desh kii ek rajya sarkaar ko giraane kii dhamkee di ja rahi thi? aisa kya tha us sikret sidi main ki netaaon ke haath-paanv phoolne lage the? or aisa bhi kya tha ki jiske paas sidi thi vahi gaayab ho gai?mantri se pehali mulakatbhanwari devi kii naukari ja chuki thi
 But her beauty was being discussed from Jodhpur to Jaipur
 vah naukari bachaane ke liye ilaake ke vidhayak malakhan singh ke paas gai
 Malkhan Singh took him to Water Resources Minister Mahipal Maderna
 phir donon ne colector se bhavari devi kii sifarish kii
 The recommendation was brought out and the suspension of Bhanwari Devi was not only canceled but she got a new posting at the government hospital in Jaliwara near her house
 aise badali bhavari kii jindagibhanvari devi, malakhan singh or mahipal kii najaron main chadh chuki thi
 She became close to both of them over time
 donon netaaon se milane ke baad bhavari ko satta kii takat kaa ahsaas ho chukaa tha
 Because of Malkhan and Maderna, he gradually met other leaders as well
 or phir dekhte hi dekhte saat-aath hajaar kii maamuli tankhwaah paane vaali bhavari devi kii jindagi puri tarah badal gai
 He built a new house
 nai car kharidi
 Admitted son and daughter in renowned schools
 satta
 
 
 Sex and conspiracy, no matter how strange it sounds
 lekin inamen hameshaa se gaharaa rishta he
 And the same is the reality
 satta ke nashe main chur netaaon ke daaman par jab jab daag lagata he, har baar kisi aise hi rishte kii hakeekat ek nai kahani ke saath saamne aa jaati he
 The story of Nurse Bhanwari Devi and her CD was also similar
 netaaon kii sohabat main aate hi ab bhavari puri tarah se satta ke ird-gird thi
 Every month was paid without going to duty
 maderna se uske rishte ko lekar bate hone lagi thi
 But the matter was about power, so everyone thought it good to keep quiet
 tikat na milane par kii blakemelingsaal 2010 tak bhavari ne satta kaa khub sukh bhoga
 But suddenly the talk deteriorated
 bhavari kii khwahishen belgaum ho gayi thi
 She now directly sought the assembly ticket in return for her relations with Malkhan Singh and Minister Maderna
 jaahir he donon ne manaa kar diya
 Just then, Bhanwari decided to make a CD of those moments of relationship
 or mantri maderna is jaal main funs gaye
 Bhanwari started blackmailing both the leaders
 donon ne fouran bhavari se duuri bana lee
 Maderna threatened Bhanwari and drove away for several months, running from Minister Maderna and MLA Malkhan Singh Bhanwari
 bhavari se bachate rahe
 Bhanwri himself also realized this
 lihaaja ek roj wo achaanak jaipur pahunch gai
 Met some mlas and leaders of BJP
 or iske saath hi sab kuch badal gaya
 It is July 2011
 bhavari devi jab malakhan or maderna se sampark karne me naakaam rahi to, vah ek din sidhe jaipur main mantri maderna ke sarkari bangale par pahunch gai
 There Maderna threatened him and drove him away
 dabaav banaakar kiya samjhautaahat hokar bhavari ne maderna par dabaav banane ke liye jaipur main hi bijepi ke kuch netaaon se mulaakaat kii or unhen pehali baar us sidi ke bare main bataaya
 The news of the CD reached the media via the political corridors of Jaipur
 or achaanak mantri mahipal, vidhayak malakhan singh or bhavari devi ke bich tamaam gile-shikave dur ho gaye
 The three were now compromised
 iske baad phir se teenon ke bich baatcheet bhi shuru ho gai thi
 It is said that by force, Maderna had promised Bhanwari Devi 60 lakh rupees in lieu of CD
 
 
 or gaayab ho gai bhavari devibhanwari ne agast 2011 main apni car bechi thi
 On September 1, a person named Sohanlal called Bhanwari and called him to his house to pay the same amount of four lakh rupees
 bhavari usee din paise lene ke liye apane ghar se nikali or phir kabhi ghar nahin lauti
 Initially, the family found Bhanwari everywhere
 12 dinon tak bhavari davi kaa koi suraag nahin mila
 Her husband wrote a report to the police
 bhavari devi ke pati amarchand ne apni bivi kii gumshudagi ke liye rajasthan sarkaar ke cabinet mantrimahipal madernako jimmedaar tehra kar satta ke galiyaaron main hadakanch machaa diya
 CBI got Bhanwari Devi Kesamala due to high profile police action
 shaq ke ghere main mantri or vidhayak bhi the
 So the police was blowing every step
 police ko jaanch main pataa chalaa ki ek sitambar ko bhavari aakhri baar jodhpur main dekhi gai thi
 After this, the record of his mobile phone was showing his presence in Sikar
 lekin uskaa koi suraag nahin mila
 Seeing the matter growing, the state government came under pressure and handed over the investigation of the case from Rajasthan Police to CBI
 sibiai jaananaa chaahati thi sidi kaa rajasibiai ke saamne sabase ahm sawaal tha ki aakhir bhavari ko sidi ke bhavar main kisne fansaa rakhaa tha? us sidi main kya tha? or us sidi ko lekar bhavari ne aisa kyon kaha tha ki agar sidi chal padi to teen din main rajasthan kii sarkaar gir jaaegi? sidi ke sach ko samajhane ke liye bhavari ko jaananaa jaruri tha
 What was the status and status of a minor nurse Bhanwari in real life, it was necessary to test it
 or use parakhte-parakhte aakhirkaar sibiai manzil tak pahunch hi gai
 Released 126 days later, exactly 126 days after Bhanwari's coronation, it was revealed that nurse Bhanwari Devi was dead
 darasal, bhavari se car kharidne vaala sohanlal bishnoi vidhayak malakhan singh kaa bhaanja tha
 He had called Bhanwari Devi and told that he would have to go to Bilada to get sixty lakh rupees in lieu of CD
 lekin rupye use tabhi milenge jab raju bhai sidi kii asaliyat parakh legein
 On September 1, Bhanwari bus was changed
 vahaan ek bulero jeep main raju or uskaa ek saathi bhavari kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 This Raju was none other than Shahabuddin, the dreaded criminal of Rajasthan
 jo raju banakar sidi kaa sauda karne aayaa tha
 This was how Bhanwari's murder was now trapped in the woven web of Sohanlal and Shahabuddin
 raju ne gaadi ke sidi player main 52 minute kii puri film dekhi
 During this time, the jeep continued to run around on the road
 jeep ke peeche sohanlal ek swift car main chal rahaa tha
 So that Bhanwari does not have any kind of doubt
 shaam hote hi bhavari ne shahabuddin se paise maange
 But Bhanwari suspects Raju's inattention
 usne shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Seeing this, Sohanlal also came inside the Bullero and these three put Bhanwari under the jeep seat
 or juuton se rond kar bhavari ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Bishnaram had planted the corpse, the link between this conspiracy was Sahiram
 vah malakhan singh or mahipal maderna kaa khaas gurga tha
 Which was monitoring this plan of murder from Jyoti Nagar area of jodhpur
 bhavari ke katl ke baad usne sohan laal ko hukum diya ki bhavari kii laash jaloda ke apradhi bishnaram ko saunp de
 So Sohanlal handed over the corpse to Bishnaram Bishnoi in Pipad area
 ab baari thi bhavari kii laash ko thikaane lagane kii lihaaja bishnaram laash ko jaloud ke jangal main luhaavat nahari puliya par le gaya or vahiin laash ko jala diya
 Jail CBI, who went to minister and MLA, revealed later that according to Bhanwari's murder, the first episode was MLA Malkhan Singh and the second link was former cabinet minister Mahipal Madernatha
 bhavari sidi ke jariye mantri maderna ko blackmel kar rahi thi
 In that CD, the minister accompanied Bhanwari Devi in an objectionable condition
 is murder cese se jude sabhi log malakhan or madherna ke log the
 Later Mahipal Maderna had to resign not only from the cabinet
 balki jail bhi janaa padaa
 The same situation happened to Malkhan Singh

 Hearing the arguments many times is not sure - are we part of the same society in which the process of breaking stereotypes is centuries old
 jis samaaj main dakiyanoosee paramparaon ko todakar aaazaad aabo-hawa taiyaar karne vaale mahanayake hue, usamen kala or abhivyakti ko lekar aisi tang soch
 History is witness, the society which tried to put the arts on guard, caused the destruction of the entire civilization
 wo chaahe raaje rajavaadon kaa daur ho yaa phir aaj ke loktantric samaaj kaa

 Here, along with the Public Protest, governments do not seem to care about such consciousness
 agar aisa hota, neude or es durga jaisi film goa ke 48wein bhartiya antarrashtriya film samaaroh se baahar nahin hoti
 Amidst all-round opposition to the film Padmavati, many people did not know why Marathi film 'nude' and Malayalam film 'S Durga' were excluded from India's International Film Festival
 ye faisla kendra sarkaar kaa tha, jiskaa virodh karte hue samaaroh ke juri adhyaksh sujoy ghosh ne istipha de diya
 The film, titled Nude, which the government stopped from performing at the Goa ceremony, has a story of women who work as nude models to stay alive in a city like Mumbai
 isamen aisi auraton kii majaburi or unke sangharsh ko kahani kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The second Malayalam film is 'S Durga'
 jisamen ek uttar bhartiya ladki durga kii kahani he, jo apane dost ke saath sunsaan sadak par lift lene ke chakkar main aisi fansati he ki uske aage tamaam kahaniyaan khulti jaati hai
 What happens when all Sharif falls asleep in the dark of night
 lekin sarkaar ko lagata he ye film kai varjanaaon ko todatii he
 What had happened to the films named 'fire' and 'water' in the name of taboos is still alive in the legacy of cinema
 deepa mehta kii film 'fire' shahari grihasth ke jindagi kii tamaam vidambnaaon or har kami ke liye aurat ko jimmedaar tehraane kii maansikta par chot he, lekin virodh kaa jhanda buland karne waalon ko dikhaa sirf devraani-jethaani ke bich samalangik sambandh
 When that protest subsided, Deepa Mehta went on to make a film about Banaras' widow's ashram
 tab uski shooting tak nahin hone di gai
 The film, titled 'water', describes the illusion that the 20-year-old girl is widowed even when she is not given a chance to start a new life
 kyon use puri umr apane armaanon ko kuchalane ke liye vidhwaa ashram bhej diya jaataa he
 The reason for the protest was completed by the shooting of Sefilm by setting up the Banaras Ghat in Sri Lanka
 virodh kii ye siyasat us daur main or bhi charam par pahunchi, jab hamaara samaaj aadhuniktaa or udaarvaad kii nai raushnee main ankhe khol rahaa tha
 Shekhar Gupta's film Bandit Queen is an example of this
 film kii kahani ek aise samaaj ko aainaa dikhaati he, jisaki samantshahi main ek dalit ladki apni maan maryaada or izzat aabru ke saath kuchli jaati he
 She does not die, stays alive and prepares herself to take barbaric revenge from the atrocities inflicted on her

 somvaar ko muslim paksh kii ore se rajeev dhawan ne apni daleelein pesh kin
 At the same time, the Chief Justice indicated that the hearing should be over by 16 October
 is maamle main mangalvaar ko hindu paksh jawaab degaa
 During the hearing on the 38th day, the counsel for the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan, questioned the scheduling and said that the court had not fixed the time for my side's reply
 dhawan or vaidyanathan donon ne likhit daleelein court ko deen
 Dhawan gave his arguments about the dome
 unhone kaha ki gumbad ke neeche ram janm hone, shraddhaluon ke vahiin phool-prasad chadhaane kaa koi bhi daawa siddh nahin kiya gaya
 Here people had entered under the dome by trespassing
 jab vahaan puja chal rahi thi to andar ghusane kaa matlab kya he? iskaa matlab puja baahar hi ho rahi thi
 Never built a mosque by breaking the temple
 vahaan lagaataar namaaz hoti rahi thi
 Dhawan said that no one has ever believed that Hindus occupied the inner enclosure
 agar bench molding of relif ke tahat kisi ek paksh ko malikana haq dekar duusare ko vikalp detii he to muslim pakshakaron kaa hi daawa banataa he
 On Dhawan's limitation, Daleyendhavan said that the question of division of title of three aspects was wrong
 islamic kanoon or quran bahut pechida he
 Hindu parties cannot reject our waqf mosque on the basis of one aspect of it
 doosraa limitesan or teesraa edwars pajeshan ko lekar he
 Dhawan said that the Hindu side did not have or did not have any ownership document
 yah vakf ki sampatti angrejon ke samay se he or hinduon ne jabaran avaidh kabja kiya
 Rajiv Dhawan argued that after we demolished the structure on 6 December 1992, we changed our demand and our demand is that we should be handed over the mosque in the same manner as the structure was on 5 December 1992
 hinduon ki ore se kai baar atikaraman kiya gaya
 During this time, a directive was issued from the state government to protect the rights of Muslims
 yah saaf karata he ki malikana haq muslimon kaa he
 Describing the orders of the Faizabad court, Rajiv Dhawan said that after the December 1949 incident, the interim order was only to maintain status quo status, no one can be given ownership under the interim order
 dhawan ne kaha- sabhi sawaal hamasen kyon?dhawan ne kaha ki taala khulne ke baad bhi hinduon kaa vahaan par kabja nahin rahaa he
 Hindus have only the right to worship
 is par justise bobade ne poocha aap ye kah rahe he ki hindu andar jate the or puja archana karte rahe the, lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki isse aapke adhikaar ko asar nahin padegaa? prasal, court ke kehane kaa matlab tha ki aapaki sampatti main koi jaataa he to aapako malikana haq ko lekar fark nahin padegaa?isi bich justise divai chandrachud ne rajeev dhawan se hinduon ke bahari ahaate par kabje ke bare main poocha, justise divai chandrachud ne kaha ki 1858 ke baad ke dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki ram chabutare kii sthapana kii gai thi, unke paas adhikaar tha
 Justice DY Chandrachud said that the British installed railings because Hindus worshiped in one part and Muslims in the other? On this Rajiv Dhawan told the bench that all the questions are being asked from Muslim parties only, questions were not asked from the Hindu side, but never mind, i will answer all the questions of the bench as soon as possible
 is par ramalala ne vakil sies vaidhanathan ne kaha ki rajeev dhawan kaa ye sawaal avaanchhneeya he
 However, the bench did not say anything on this and the hearing of the case went ahead
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki unka suut limiteshan ke daayre main he, muslim paksh ne limiteshan kii avadhi khatm hone se chaar din pehle daakhil kiya tha
 Justice Chandrachud said that after 23 December 1949, there was no Namaz there, but the worship continued? There was no Namaz, but worship continued? Justice Chandrachud said that after 23 December 1949 there was no Namaz there, but the worship continued? On this, Dhawan said that if for some reason the namaz could not be performed in the mosque, it does not mean that the existence of the mosque ended
 ram janmabhumi nyaas kaa gathan isliye kiya gaya taaki masjid ko giraaya ja sake
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu side had no proof that Lord Rama was born in the inner enclosure
 is baat ke bhi koi saboot nahin kii aantarik ahaate main puja hoti thi
 Rajeev Dhawan said that the opinion of Justice Khan and Justice Sharma in the judgment of Allahabad High Court was different
 justise khan ne kaha tha ki masjid banane ke liye kisi strecchar ko dhwast nahin kiya gaya tha, jabaki justise sharma kii raay isse alag thi
 Dhawan said that Jilani had rightly said that no documents before 1885 should be accepted
 1885 se pehle ke jo dastavej hindu paksh ke paas he wo sirf videshi yatriyon kii kitaab or skanda puraana or duusari kitabe hai
 Rajiv Dhawan said that even though the mosque has been demolished, the mosque is always a mosque
 ayodhya main dhwast yaa giraayi gai imaarat aaj bhi masjid he
 Rajiv Dhawan said that Aurangzeb was an extremely liberal king
 mohammad gori sahit duusare log jinhone bharat main yuddh kiya, kya unhone masjidon kaa nirmaan kiya? - ek nai tarah kaa itihaas likhane kii koshish na ki jaae
 If Babur's work is reviewed, Ashoka will also have to do it
 dhawan bole- hindu paksh ke behad simit jaankaree hairaajeev dhawan ne kaha ki islamic kanoon behad complex he? isko lekar hindu paksh ke behad simit jaankaree he
 On this, PN Mishra said on Rajiv Dhawan that how can you say that we have less information on Islam? Have a debate
 pien mishra ne kaha ki aap ye bataane vaale koun he ki ham kya bahes karen kya nahin? court ne hamen bahes karne kii ijaajat di or hamanen kii
 Meanwhile, CJI smilingly said Rajiv Dhawan has immense knowledge
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki malikana haq ko lekar hindu paksh ke paas koi saboot nahin he
 Rajiv Dhawan said that will the court excavate all the 500 mosques, on which it is said that they are built on the Hindu temple? Raajeev Dhawan raised the question that even if some parts of other religion are found under the mosque, will the 450-year-old mosque become illegal? While reading a letter, the chairman of the Sunni Waqf Board UP sent a letter to Mr
 Ram Panchu, a member of the arbitration committee, stating the danger of life in the letter
 is par CJI justise ranjan gogoi ne uttar pradesh sarkaar ko kaha ki jafar ahamed faruki ko turant suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kaa aadesh diya
 On behalf of the Muslim side, the hearing of the said case will be completed by Thursday
 is par CJI justise ranjan gogoi ne muskuraate hue kaha ki ham sunwaayee 'buudhvaar' ko bhi puri kar sakate hai
 Saying this the five-member constitution bench arose
 furnandis ko yaad karte hue nitish kumaar ne media se kaha, 'unke netritv or maargdarshan main jo kuch bhi seekhney kaa avasar mila, aaj jo kuch bhi logon kii seva ke liye karne kii koshish karte hai, vah unka maargdarshan hi he
 He was very important to all of us
 vaise to har kisi kaa janaa tay he, lekin unka swasthya jis dhang se tha vah to unke liye mukti hi he
 This is a very sad situation for all of us
 ab ham logon kaa yah sankalp hoga ki jo unka maargdarshan tha or unhone logon ke haq kii ladaai ladi, unhen kabhi nahin bhuulenge

 agar aap british parampara ke patrkaar hai, to dhoortta or rob ke sankramak ghalmail se fusfusaate hai
 The rest of the Kalamghisu may shout or grin at the chatter to get their story across, but removing the skins of hair is an anglo-indian specialty
 angreji press kaa mukhya hissaa-diary-saamaajik or rajnatik samaacharon ke bich se chamakate hue apni raah nikaal letaa he
 The reverse is that the brevity of a diary item gives the journalist more opportunity to draw its meaning further than a longer report
 antarnihit baaten suspasht baton se kahin aage hoti hai, or pariklpanaaon ko use or aage le jane ke liye protsaahit karti hai
 30 years ago, the British press left nothing to the imagination when it reported the most tickling fact of a 20th-century wedding to Saloni Diana and the raised-ear Charles, who was the crown prince of the British crown and is still today
 Had
 press ne fusfusaahat bhari report di ki dyna kaa comarya pareekshan hua tha, or sab thik-thaak he
 Nobody expected Charles to have a virginity test
 yah raja kii tauheen karnaa hota
 In the old pleasant days — in fact, it was only for the king — the British prince used to exercise his right to sleep with the bride on her first night, and the bride would dress herself outside, either by herself
 With friends, or with beer - whichever is less slippery
 apekshaakrit zyada samanthapurna yug kii shuruyaat ke saath hi vah visheshadhikaar to lupt ho gaya, lekin darbari ucch varg main ling samanta nahin hoti
 The girls were trained in such a way that they would be fit for marriage and should not bother their minds in studies
 rajgaraane ke kisi purush ke liye kunara hona koi gun nahin tha
 The man was expected, and still is, today, to spread his seeds a little too much, which would have some inevitable consequences
 jyeshthadhikaar (jisamen sabase bade bete ko sab kuch mil jaataa he or uske sahodaron ko salikedaar handshek) main yakeen rakhane vaala british kuleen varg kabhi bhi langik samanta kaa acha vigyaapan nahin rahaa
 These days, the British shops of books must be littered with the history books of the royal household
 yah bhi maan liya jaae ki inamen se kuch kisse lekhakon ne teji se paisa kamaane ke chakkar main apni rachanaatmakataa se badaye-chadaaye honge, to bhi in kisson main itane paryaapt dogale to hai hi ki khuda kii puri das gaaj gir paden
 Like Shakespeare's Prince Hall, Sir John Falstaff's princes still enjoy the pleasure of their attendant associations, even though today's Falstaffs have neither the brawny-like shrewdness nor the extravagance like that
 aadhunik rajasi sharabakhaana nite club hota he, haalanki raat purush ko aaj bhi vahi aawaara sukh detii he, jo vah paanch dashak pehle detii thi
 The first victory may have been given to the prince, but the final victory will be the prerogative of the princess
 dyna tab tak kunari thi, jab tak uski charles se shaadi hui, do bacchon ke janm ke baad, usne charles ko kunara bana diya, jabaki vah khud antarrashtriya chuhalbaji par nikal padi, jisase media ko histyria ke daure pad gaye or british rajgaraane ke saamne arab raktavali pehali santan kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya
 British prince does not get angry
 unke hoth unke sharir kaa sabase kathor ang hote hai, raat main bhi
 They are not afraid of wrath but are ridiculed
 17veen sadi main arl of rochester kaa kiya charles dwitiya kaa apmaan (yahaan rahata he ek mahaan or shaktishaalee samraat / jiske vaadon par koi vishwaas nahin karata / jisane aaj tak koi bevakoofi kii baat nahin kahi / na hi kabhi koi samajhadaari kaa kaam kiya) sirf badnaam karne vaali boli thi, koi ghaav nahin tha
 It does not matter that Charles II never acted sensibly
 dyna ke kamandh prem prasangon se jis barfili chuppi ke saath pesh aayaa gaya, usne us rajvansh ko bachaane main madad kii, jo manoranjanatmak mulya main apane charam par tha, lekin pratishtha kho chukaa tha
 Although Diana's death in a Paris car accident will remain permanently adorned with a world secret, her sudden death must have been a relief for the wounded powerhouse, who had been destabilized by the madness of a hated woman
 chunki british rajgaraane ko chhutkaare kii apni saansen chhipaane kaa sadiyon purana abhyaas he, isliye unhone ise dyna kii tadak-bhadak vaali antyeshti main bhi acchhee tarah kar liya
 Diana's husband Charles, who was certainly the best known husband of any of the jarini's, was wearing a stone mask
 charles ko rajvansh kaa rakt mila, lekin zyada bhagya nahin, ve charles tritiy banane ke liye pehle hi 59 varsh intjaar kar chuke hai or unki maa aaj bhi puri tarah tandoorust hai
 Bellaus Diana changed the rules before she died
 jab uskaa betaa rajkumaar wiliam, vijayi andaaj vaale madhyamvargeey mul kii sundari ket midilaton se 29 april ko vivaah karegaa, to mehmaanon main ket ke purvapurush mitra bhi honge
 They will meet William's former girlfriends
 koi yah ummid nahin karata ki ket kunari hogi, yaa vah apana comarya wiliam ko de chuki hogi
 The royal house has finally merged with Britain, from which it was staying away for the maximum time possible
 british press main ab koi fusfusaahat nahin ho rahi he
 Because Diana killed the whispers before she died
 samajha jaataa he ki baba ramdev se milane ke liye varisht mantriyon ko hawaii adde bhejne ko lekar aalochanaon ke ghere main ai sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki varisht mantri or visheshkar pranab mukherjee yogaguru se aage kii baatcheet karne unase phir mulaakaat nahin karenge
 Sources in the Congress said the party would not mind if ministers like Subodh Kant Sahay, who had a good rapport with Ramdev, go to talk
 congress ne ramdev se baatcheet karne ke liye mantriyon ko hawaii adde bhejne ke asaadhaaran kadam par gambhir aapatti jataai thi
 The issue was discussed in the party's core group meeting held in the presence of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 sutron ne kaha ki ramdev kii aalochana karne vaale congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne mukherjee se mulaakaat kar is mudde par party kii chintaaon se unhen avgat karaayaa
 The party has kept silence on the issue so much that no spokesperson except Abhishek Singhvi has said anything about it
 singhvi ne sirf yah kaha ki ramdev se samvaad saadhane kii sarkaar kii koshishon ko kamajori nahin samajha jaae
 However, a senior minister admitted that the government's efforts were a sign of weakness, but the government was not weak
 mantri ne kaha ki mantriyon ke hawaii adde jane ko lekar kuch aapattiyaan thim lekin yah bataaya gaya ki yah cabinet kii raajnneetik maamalon kii samiti kaa faisla tha

 Today the whole country is connected with Jhunjhunu

 Jhunjhunu district has carried forward the campaign of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao in a spectacular manner
 isliye main apane aap ko yahaan aane se roak nahin paaya
 In the PM Mission Nutrition Mission, the PM said that as much as my opponents call me good and bad, it is their wish that if PM says this then it should not mean Narendra Modi (prime Minister) but nutrition mission
 isse is mishan ko badhaane main kaaphi madad milegi
 We have to fight the war against malnutrition
 piem ne kaha ki jhunjhanu jhukna nahin jaanata mushkilon se jujhna jaanata he
 He said that in our country women are worshiped, but what happened is that they have to fold their hands and feet to save the daughter
 or sarkaron ko bajet nikaalnaa pad rahaa he
 The PM said that today when the difference in the birth rate of boys and girls is seen, it is very sad
 unhone kaha ki ab logon ko tay karnaa hoga ki jitne bete paidaa honge, utani hi betiyaan paidaa hongi
 The more the son can read, the more the daughter will also read
 isaki shuruyaat hamen aaj se hi kerani chahie
 He said that if the mother-in-law in the house says that we want a daughter, no one has the courage to stop the daughter from being born
 betiyon ke janm ke liye jaagarukta failaani hogi
 He said that after the coming of our government, we launched Beti Bachao Beti Padhao from Haryana
 jiske baad vahaan par betiyon ke janm ke anupaat main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 Today, daughters are illuminating the name in the country
 jo log maanate hai ki betaa he budhaape main kaam aayega to ye galat he
 i have seen many times that sons live a life of comfort, but parents live in old age homes

 nehru ji kii yah varshganth aise samay main ai he, jab desh na to bal diwas manaane kii haisiyat main he or na hi puri shraddha se guru parv manaa paa rahaa he
 In fact, barring a few charities and leaders, the whole country is upset with the change of note
 logon par yah pareshaani kaale dhan ke naam par thopi gai he
 Prime Minister himself readily said that give me 50 days
 lekin dihadi mazdooree karne vaala aadmi nahin samaj paa rahaa ki uskaa dil to 50 din desh par qurbaan kar saktaa he, lekin uske bal bacchon kaa pet yah kaam kaise kar paaegaa? vigyaan ne abhi 50 din tak bhukh saadhane kii dawa to ijad kii nahin he
 In this situation, Pandit Nehru's speech at Sevagram in March 1948 becomes very relevant
 yahaan jab moulana aaazaad, dow rajendra prasad, vinoba bhaave, acharya kriplani or jai prakaash narayan jaise netaaon ne nehru se poocha ki baapu to ja chuke hai, unke baad rahanumai koun karegaa? to nehru ne do vakt kii roti or tan dhankane ke liye kapade ko jujh rahe desh main jo baaten kahin, wo tarikhi hai
 Nehru said clearly that don't say big things, if i am the Prime Minister, i will do anything and arrange for roti cloth
 aap shaakh pattiyon main uljhe rahiye, main jad se chizon ko durust karuunga
 Read part of the speech - great men can sit and serve separately
 lekin unhen bhi paristhiti ke saath apane aapako jodna padataa he
 Mahatma used to tie himself with questions
 unhone khaadi ko aazaadee ke saath joda, isliye vah badi
 She would not have grown so much just financially
 mahatmaji main vah sifat thi
 We are thinking about Khadi and so on leaving big questions
 apane liye alag-alag darba bana rahe hai
 Mahatma ji's eyes were on the whole country
 ve buniyadi sawaalon ko pakad lete the
 So he went to Noakhali, went to Calcutta, went to Bihar, sat in Dehli
 pyarelal ji semain puri tarahsahamat hum
 We do not need to find work
 kaam desh bhar main padaa hua he
 Let us see what is the basic work, what is the basic work
 baapu kii maut chilla chillaakar kahati he ki vah kaam koun sa he
 In the name of creative work, we should not work in our food
 baapu ne dilli main jo kaam kiya usase sawaal kii ahmiyat kaa pataa chalata he
 We cannot save our freedom without combating the poison of communalism
 sawaalon kaa hal karne kaa sarkaar kaa dhang alag tarah kaa hota he
 He has his own limitations
 sirf sarkaar kii takat se sawaal hal nahin hote
 i am in government
 dilli main rahata hum
 You have to be on guard day and night
 baahar niklun aage sipaahi, peeche sipaahi hote hai
 This is not human life
 main pareshaan hum
 i have to live in a cage
 mere liye ahmednagar or duusare kaidakhaanon se bada kaidakhana yah he
 The real imprisonment is for me today
 agar yahi haal rahaa to main pagal ho jaaoongaa
 How long will i be able to bear it? khaadi gramodyog vagairah ke silsile main yahaan par kuch buniyadi baaten uthaai gayi
 Keep this question separate from other questions
 compititive econmi or ek nayaa soshal order kii baat kahi gai
 It remains to be seen what their values are
 main compititive iconmi se doosraa matlab samajhataa hum
 The economy you are presenting, it can stay on its own strength
 agar aaj nahin to das saal ke baad, apni taangon par khadaa hone kaa dam usamen hoga yaa nahin
 Government help you start it
 lekin buniyadi cheez yah he ki kya usamen apni taangon par khadaa hone kaa dam he! ann kii kami he
 If there is a shortage of food, we cannot meet it, then a government will let people die a little hungry! As far as her bus goes, she will bring food from outside
 kapade kii kami he
 a vacuum has been prepared
 agar ham use khaadi se na bhar saken to koi bhi sarkaar, mil ke kapade kii baat to alag, videshi kapadaa laae bina nahin rahegi
 She cannot let people stay naked
 agar vah kapade kii kami ko dur karne kii koshish nahin karegi, to nateeja khatarnaak hoga
 If we can make our own cloth then the government may help
 mil halke-halke band karen or baahar kaa kapadaa band kar den to kya vaikum apane aap bhar jaayegaa
 Today, if the cloth of foreign cloth or mills was able to fill the vacuum, then the vacuum would not exist
 magar vaikum he, iskaa matlab yah he ki hamaare paas hamaari jarurat ke laayak kapadaa nahin he
 This is a threat to the country
 videshi kapadaa or milon kaa kapadaa aane ke baad bhi kapade kii jo kami rah jaati he, use bhi khaadi puraa nahin kar sakati
 If the goods of the village industries cannot stand on their legs after a few days with the help of the government, then it will not stop
 baat kuch pechida he
 i do not know how far i have been able to clean it
 meraa matlab yah he ki compititive iconmi nikaal dene se sawaal hal nahin hota
 The second thing is about war, that is why we don't want to fight war with anyone
 lekin desh raksha kaa puraa-puraa intjaam hamen karnaa hoga
 You say that industries should not be planned from the point of view of defense of the country
 main arj kar duun ki aisa koi udyog nahin jiskaa ki desh-rakshan ke saath sambandh na ho
 Clothes also protect the country
 desh-rakshan kii drushti se hamen industiligeshan ek had tak karnaa padegaa
 It does not compete with Cottage Industries
 home industies se alag audyogikaran kaa ek dhaancha hamen bananaa he
 We have given the country an atmosphere due to industrialization
 uskaa mazdooree kii dar par or tankhwaahon par asar hota he
 But i do not doubt that no matter how industrialized it is, there will be scope to increase village industries a lot for Pachasa or a hundred years
 sawaal yah he ki kin-kin baton main gramodyog chal sakegaa or kinbatonmen nahin
 Today i do not have the exact answer
 desh rakshan kaa sawaal ek aisa sawaal he ki jisase sari audyogic phija hi badal jaati he
 If large industries are under the control of the state, then they become non-competitive
 gharelu dastakaariyaan kin kshetron main or kahaan tak badhen, yah adhyayan kaa sawaal he
 It is the duty of the government to increase the number of things in which domestic handicrafts can run
 duniya kii buniyadi samasya yah he ki sari duniya rajnatik or aarthik drushti se kendrikaran kii taraf badhati ja rahi he
 We also want to strengthen the central government by giving it more powers
 sifat is baat main he ki ham kendrikaran or vikendrikaran ke phaayde jodne kii tarkeeb nikaalen
 If we leave the question of protecting the country, we will not be able to keep our political independence
 to phir aarthik swatantraaa kaise rakh sakenge
 This question is not straightforward
 kaaphi pechida he
 If Khadi does not work without spinning, then you will have to think whether it will run or not
 usamen economic out-turn kaa sawaal he
 There is another type of spinning wheel itself
 charkha to kuch chune hue log chalaayenge babu rajendra prasad chalaawein, main chalaaun, is tarah kai aadmi chalaa len
 These chosen men should be one lakh or one million
 ve apane kapade kaa sawaal hal kar len, lekin aarthik drushti se kapade kii paidaavaar kaa sawaal hal nahin kar sakate
 This question belongs to another area
 isliye maine arj kiya ki in sawaalon ko phir se nai phija kii roshni main sochna he
 Last month, at least 15 people were killed and many injured, mostly laborers, in the country's eastern province of Punjab
 jald hi mobile chori se logon ko chhutkaaraa mil saktaa he kyonki ise gaayab karne waalon ko iskaa koi phayda nahin hoga
 The government is set to introduce a new system that will stop all services on stolen or missing mobile phones
 ye vyavastha sim hataane yaa IMEI number badalane par bhi sabhi network par kaam karegi
 Public sector Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited BSNL was given the responsibility of developing the software and implementation modalities for this new system Central Impact Identity Register (CEIR) and the company was given a pilot basis for six months from its Pune center in Maharashtra
 Have to test on ek aadhikarik dastavej main kaha gaya he ki CEIR kaa makasad nakli mobile phone kii sankhya main kami laana or chori ko hatotsahit karnaa he
 This will safeguard the interests of the customers and facilitate the way for the investigating agencies to legally interception
 doorsanchaar vibhaag kii yojana ke anusaar CEIR system IMEI database ko sabhi mobile operataron ke saath jodygi
 According to the document, CEIR works as a central system for sharing mobile terminals (sets) in the black list among all network operators so that devices placed in one network in that category do not work in another
 yah sthiti tab bhi hogi jab sim card badal diya jaae
 When the mobile phone is missing, the person concerned has to provide the IMEI number to locate the handset
 IMEI 15 ankon kii sankhya he jo ki udyog sanghathan GSMA abantit karata he
 The document states that theft of mobile phones is not only a financial loss but also threatens national security along with the personal lives of citizens
 gaayab hue, churaaye gayi yaa nakli handset ke IMEI ko CEIR kii soochna di jaaegi
 The Department of Telecommunications has, however, forbade telecom operators to provide services to mobile phones with fake IMEI numbers
 lekin companiyon konkali IMEI numberwaale handset kii pahchaan main dikkat aati he
 CEIR will also help operators identify handsets with fake IMEI numbers
 doorsanchaar vibhaag niyamon ko bhi adhishuchet karne kii taiyaari main he jisamen IMEI sankhya main chhedchhad dandaneey aparaadh hoga

 purvi dilli ke shakarpur ilaake me bandhak banaakar rape karne kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The incident happened when the victim went to take medicine near the house
 vahiin, usko naushaad mila or peedita ko yah kahkar car main baitha liya ki usko koi jaruri baat kerani he
 At that time someone else was driving the car
 peedita kaa parivaar chaar maheene pehle tak naushaad ke yahaan kiraye par rahata tha jisaki vajah se vah uske saath chali gai
 Naushad went with the victim to an unknown house where the woman already present gave him the intoxicating substance
 tippaniyan When the victim regained consciousness, all the clothes were removed from her body
 iske baad peedita ko us makaan main jabaran 12 dinon tak bandhak banaakar rakhaa gaya or uske saath vah shaks rape karata rahaa
 Later, the accused released the victim on the condition that she would not tell anyone what happened to her here
 vahiin, aaropee apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon se inkaar kar rahaa he
 Currently, Naushad is arrested by the police and has started a search for the woman who fed the intoxicating substance
 ghatana us vakt jab peedita ghar ke paas hi dawaai lene gai thi
 At the same time, he got Naushad and made the victim sit in the car saying that he had to do something important
 car ko us vakt koi or shaksh chalaa rahaa tha
 The victim's family lived in Naushad four months ago on rent, due to which she moved with him
 naushaad peedita ko lekar ek anjaan makaan par gaya jahaan pehle se maujuud mahila ne use nashili cheez pilaa di
 The comments peedita ko jab hosh aayaa to uske badan se saare kapade utre hue the

 The Delhi government started the Aam Aadmi Express bus service, but the opposition refused to board it
 dilli sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ye bas seva un logon ke liye phaayde vaali hogi, jo jaldi pahunchnaa chaahate hai or bina ruke unhen apane gantavy tak pahunchaayegi
 But both BJP and Congress have not only flagged off this common man bypass express bus, but also accused them of cheating people in the name of this bus service
 dilli congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ke mutabik ye bas seva kejariwal sarkaar kii naakaami kii nishaani he, kyonki jab dilli main congress ne satta chodi thi, tab ditisi ke bede main saade paanch hazaar basen thim, lekin ab dedh saal baad ditisi ke paas chaar hazaar basen bachi hai, jo logon ko safar ke liye muhaiyaa hoti hai
 Instead of increasing the buses, the government reduced the buses
 Not only this, about one thousand buses get away from the passengers due to some malfunction and in such a way, the regular route buses have been reduced in the name of common man bus service
 maakan ke mutabik dilli sarkaar sirfraajnneetik labhlene ke liye alag alag naam se basen chalaa rahi he, jabaki ek bhi nai bas sarkaar nahin kharid pai he or iskaa khamiyaja log bhugat rahe hai
 BJP also did not delay in besieging the Kejriwal government on the launch of Aam Aadmi Bypass Express
 bijepi ke rashtriya mantri aar pi singh ne to chutki lee or kaha ki aam aadmi bypass express chalaakar kejariwal sarkaar ne apane un vaadon ko hi bypass kar diya, jo chunaav ke pehle janata se kiye gaye the
 The annual budget is an economic exercise of the government and there is also a politics to please special groups
 isliye 28 farvari ko pi
 Within a few hours of Chidambaram presenting the budget, when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar welcomed the budget, those keeping an eye on politics raised their ears
 mukhya vipakshi gathbandhan endie kaa ek mukhyamantri or duusare sabase bade sahyogi dal kaa netaa kendriya bajet kii tarif kare, aisa aksar nahin hota
 Although Nitish Kumar's appreciation of the budget is in the context of the indications expressed for granting special state status to Bihar, it cannot be cut off from the internal politics of the NDA
 maujuuda samay main sawaal yah he ki agar bijepi narendra modi ko bataur pradhanmantri project kare to kya nitish endie chhod denge? yah yaksha prashn desh ke saamne he jiskaa jawaab philhal nischitata ke saath nahin diya ja saktaa
 But political analysts believe that while NDA leaders are vying to support Modi for the post of Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar of JDU may consider the possibility of leaving the alliance
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ke liye paala badalanaa rajnatik rup se nuksaandeh ho saktaa he, lekin bihar main bijepi se gathbandhan ke phaaydon ko chhodia bhi mufeed nahin dikhataa
 In the event of Modi being accepted as the prime ministerial candidate, Nitish will be in danger of losing Muslim votes
 bihar ke kul matadaataaon main lagbhag 16 fisadi musalmaan hai
 The Nitish camp is afraid that if Narendra Modi comes out as the leader of the NDA, he will not be able to form a government in Bihar again, because he can hardly manage Muslim voters with Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Have been disillusioned with musalamaanon ke liye kalyankari upaay karne or november 2005 main sattarudh hone ke baad se pradesh main chunaav prachaar se narendra modi ko dur rakhane ke liye bijepi ko majaboor kar hi nitish ne yah safalataa hasil kii he
 By breaking ties with BJP on Modi's issue, Nitish Muslims can become heroes among voters, but they may be deprived of 12 percent of the upper caste vote bank of BJP supporters
 yah bhi tathy he ki 1995 main jab nitish or bijepi alag-alag vidhansabha chunaav lade the to avibhajit bihar kii 324 vidhansabha seat main se donon ko milakar mahaj 48 siten hi mil pai thi
 Nitish's problem is that if he compromises on Modi's name, Lalu will get a chance to regain his yadav-muslim (MY) support base
 vaise bijepi ke saath nitish kaa gathbandhan phydemand rahaa he
 Nitish knows that a new socio-political equation can emerge from the breakdown of the BJP-JDU alliance
 2010 main endie ko mili 39 fisadi maton kii tulana main argedy-lok janashaktiparty gathbandhan ko 29 fisadi vot mili the
 Nitish cautiously has not yet set any deadline for the NDA to nominate a 'secular' candidate instead of Modi
 lekin modi ko 'sabase lokapriy netaa’ or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 'ek mahatvapurn bhoomika’ ke liye upyukt bataane vaale bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ke 18 farvari ke bayaan ne party kii ranneeti kii ore ishaara kar diya he
 But Nitish does not appear to be in the mood for a decision until the BJP decides
 nitish ne haal hi main kaha, ''is mudde par hamaari party main koi shankaa nahin he
 But the issue of leadership of the alliance will be decided in the NDA meeting itself
 ” 16 farvari ko schuli bacchon ke liye surya namaskara anivaary karne vaale paripatr ko jis tatparta se unhone sanshodhit karavaaya, usase bhi alpsankhyak matadaataaon ko naaraaz na karne kii unki ichha hi jaahir hui
 The meaning is clear - Nitish will not sacrifice his politics for NDA

 In Uttar Pradesh, there is a constant tussle between Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Akhilesh Yadav
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar 'sarkas ke sher' sambandhi tippanee karne vaale mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko jawaab dete hue samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki sher chaahe kitna bhi bhookha ho, vah sher hi rahegaa
 Former Chief Minister Akhileshne Mainpuri said in the state government documents of the state that the name of Baba Saheb was changed to 'bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar' in the state government documents, 'now it is necessary that the Chief Minister of the state Yogi Adityanath read some lines of the Constitution Take it
 'samvidhan padhane kii di salaahunhone kaha, 'agar pard lenge to vah sadan main yah bhi nahin kahenge ki sher bhookha he, vah duusare kaa khaanaa khaataa he
 No matter how hungry a lion is, it will remain a lion
 yogi agar samvidhan pard lenge to shaayad sadan main samaajwaad ko lekar dikhne vaali unki naaraazgi nahin dikhaai degi
 'it may be known that during the discussion on the budget of 2018-19 in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi said without naming anyone that some people have become' lions of circus' today
 'sarkas kaa sher' shikaar karne main asamarth hota he, isliye dusron kii juuthan par hi apni peeth thapthapaata or gauravanvit hone kii koshish karata he
 He had said that he is proud because he feels that he has found a victim
 'sarkas kaa sher' banane ke bajaay khud par or apane swabhimaan par vishwaas karen to bahut acchhee baat hogi
 Yogi also associated socialism with Fascism and Nazism, describing it as 'deceit' and 'mirage'
 iske baad sapa pramudkhileshne is par kiye gaye 'twit' main kaha tha ki samvidhan kii prastaavna main 'samaajawaadee' shabd samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke rup main darj he
 The Chief Minister's call for socialism to be 'false, abolished and betrayed' is a serious issue of contempt of the constitution, for which he should apologize to the country 'and should step down as a true yogi

 In Karnataka, the BJP leader has been made deputy CM, who in 2012 was found to be watching porn in the assembly while he was a minister
 naam he lakshmana saudi

 Just, the final seal is yet to be confirmed in a secret meeting to be held in the camp in this regard on Tuesday evening
 asal main jasmit ko dere kii gaddi saunp kar ram rahim ke gharavaale ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaahate hai
 One way, he will be able to reduce the dominance of Honeypreet and second, with Jasmeet becoming the dera chief, the key to the wealth of crores will remain with his family

 In such a situation, the Dera administration has no choice but to hold a secret meeting
 dere ke log mote taur par do vajahon se aisa karne kii jaldi main hai
 First, they can shore up Honeypreet on the same pretext, which till now had not only ruled the heart of Ram Rahim, but also started ruling the path of his heart
 haalat yahaan tak paidaa ho gaye the ki wo khud ram rahim ke gharavaalon ko hi kuch nahin samajhati thi
 Secondly, after Ram Rahim and Honeypreet went to jail, almost all the businesses except the school and college of the camp have either come to a standstill or their pace has stopped
 inamen dere kii 20 se zyaada factriyon ke kaam-dhandhe shaamil hai
 In such a situation, the earnings of the dera have also been affected
 in halaat main jab tak kisi ko dere kii patavaar thaamne ke liye adhikarik taur par zimmedaari naa saunpi jaae, dere par chaaya sankat kaa badal chantanevaala nahin he
 Therefore, Ram Rahim's family secretly wants to sit down with the special people of the camp and take the final decision on it
 vaise bhi dere kii kaman jasmit ko saunpane kaa bidaa jisane uthaaya he, dere main uske baraabar philhal kisi kii haisiyat nahin
 Because she is none other but Ram Rahim's mother Naseeb Kaur
 jab khud kii maa kisi mishan main ho, to bhala koun unka rasta kaat saktaa he
 Naseeb Kaur has considered her grandson as the head of the camp
 unhone is par jail main band apane bete ram rahim kii hami bhi le lee he
 In such a situation, after the formality of Tuesday's secret meeting, Jasmeet can be officially handed over the command of the camp on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Ram Satim's Guru Shah Satnam on 25 November

 2-haalia chunaav main congress 16 rajyon, do centreshasit pradeshon main apana khaataa tak nahin khol saki
 Even eight former chief ministers and party leaders in the Lok Sabha lost their elections
 congress ne puure desh main 421 ummidavaaron ko utaara tha lekin isamen se keval 52 hi jeet sake
 This is the second time in a row that the party has performed so poorly
 chunaav main haarane vaale netaaon main congress kaaryakarini main shaamil chaar netaa bhi hai, joki party ke faisle lene vaali sanstha he
 3-no one may speak openly inside the Congress, but internally, leaders have raised questions on the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and the modalities of his campaign in the recent election
 in netaaon ko lagata he ki rahul gandhi ko do aam chunaavon main mauka diya gaya lekin party santoshjanak pradarshan nahin kar paa rahi
 This time the election was a do or die for the Congress
 maahaul bhi is baar congress ke paksh main jaataa dikhaa lekin parinaam thik ulate aae
 For this, three issues are said to be important on which Rahul Gandhi could not do very well
 pehla hindutv, doosraa teen talaak or teesraa nyaay yojana
 The party could not be vocal on Hindutva, three divorces were opposed and the justice plan was projected in the last moments of the election
 lihaaja party athak prayaas ke baad bhi kaaphi peeche chhot gai
 4-rahul Gandhi has been trying hard to unite the Congress camp in the states, but there is a difference between the state level presidents and the leaders there
 iskaa jeeta jaagta udhaaharan rajasthan, madhya pradesh, haryana or dilli jaise rajyon main dikhaa
 There are differences between Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Kamal Nath vs Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh, Bhupinder Singh Hooda vs Ashok Tanwar in Haryana and Sheila Dixit vs Ajay Maken in Delhi
 lakh chaahane ke baavjood rahul gandhi isaki kaat nahin nikaal paae
 The 4 reasons on which the Congress may have lost the Ade-1 Congress to celebrate, but its leaders believe that the biggest feature of the nehru-gandhi family is to unite the party
 pradeshon ke netaa alaakaman kii baat sir ankhon par bithaate hai or dilli se jo nirdesh paarit hon, uske mutabik aage kaa kaam hota he
 What the party can do to win the election, the president of the nehru-gandhi family has been strategizing its strategy well
 sonia gandhi ne apane adhyaksh pad kaal main party ko baandhe rakhaa or sarkaar bhale gathbandhan kii bane, unhone isamen kendriya role nibhaayaa
 Rahul Gandhi missed it but now he is definitely engaged in its 'course correction'
 2-ek do dashak pehle kii baat karen to nehru-gandhi parivaar ke alaava congress kii adhyakshata jagjivan ram, ke
 Kamaraj, Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesari remained in the hands
 aaj kii peedi ke netaa in adhyakshon ke kaam kaa pradarshan or nehru-gandhi parivaar ke adhyakshon kaa kaam dekhte hai to unhen indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi, sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke kaam par zyada bharosa hota he
 These leaders believe that if someone other than the nehru-gandhi family becomes president, then there is more discord and factionalism within the party, which affects the functioning
 isse bachane ke liye congress netaa rahul gandhi main party kaa ujjwal bhavishya dekhte hai
 3- At the national level, no other leader like Rahul Gandhi has any appeal
 rahul gandhi kii visheshta he ki jahaan kshatrapon se meljol badhanaa ho, vahaan ve isse nahin hichakate or jahaan party kaa swabhimaan aage rakhana ho, ve usamen bhi peeche nahin hatate
 His strategy worked in Tamil Nadu and he cleared the BJP and ADMK alliance
 dilli main unhone congress kaa swabhimaan aage rakhaa or aam aadmi party ko ghor pratidwandvi maanate hue gathbandhan se inkaar kiya
 The Congress may not have won here, but it was definitely at number two and made a dent in the vote share of the Aam Aadmi Party
 4-jab baat functional autonami kii aati he to sabaki nigahen nehru-gandhi parivaar par tik jaati hai
 Apart from Rahul Gandhi, if any other leader is made president, there will be decentralization of power, separate power centers will be formed
 isse siyaasi takaraar badhegi or party main netritv kaa sankat gahrayega
 Congress leaders want to avoid the politics of this confrontation and want to see Rahul Gandhi as the President
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki rahul gandhi apane mansoobey main kaamyaab hote hai yaa party main unke shubhachintak netaa rahul gandhi ko hi adhyaksh pad par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 All eyes are on whether the Congress will go beyond the nehru-gandhi family or Rahul Gandhi will take over

 The BJP has taken a U-turn on the word 'love Jihad'
 vivaad ke baad upi bijepi ne pradesh kaaryakarini kii baithak main apane aadhikarik agenda se 'lav jehad' shabd hi hataa diya he
 Although the word has been removed from the agenda, it has been mentioned differently
 baithak ke duusare din jab party ne prastaav paarit kiya to usamen likhaa gaya he ki rajya main varg vishesh kii mahilaon se ho rahe duraachaar or usamen ek varg vishesh ke logon kaa sammilit hona mahaj sanyog he yaa yojana, ye chintaa kaa vishay he
 That means somewhere the love is towards love jihad
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko is baithak ke bare main press note jari kiya gaya tha, to usamen lav jehad kaa zikr tha
 But when the state executive meeting started on Saturday, the party leaders spoke on other issues but the silence on Love Jihad remained unmoved
 ab jab prastaav paarit hua he to is shabd kaa istemaal nahin he
 However, this is mentioned in another way
 ishaara saaf he ki party ise aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main siyaasi mudda banaaegi
 This proposal was passed - the misconduct of women belonging to a particular class in UP and the involvement of a section of people in it is a coincidence or plan

 Some Bharatiya Janata Party workers had appealed to rename Khan Market as Valmiki Market

 narendra modi ne kaha tha ki unki chhavi lutian dilli yaa khan market giroh dwaara nahin banaai gai he, balki unke apane 45 saal mehnat or parishram se chhavi bani he
 On this statement of Narendra Modi, a member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Deepak Tanwar took PM Modi's statement very seriously and recently changed the name of Khan Market to 'valmiki Market' due to the historical importance of Valmiki ji to the Home Minister

 During the 30th (september 24) day hearing on the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute in the Supreme Court, the Muslim side admitted that Ram Chabutra is the birthplace as Hindu claimants have also believed in it for years
 muslim paksh ne kaha tha ki is maamle main 1885 main district jaj kaa aadesh he ki hindu ram chabutare ko jansthaan maanate the
