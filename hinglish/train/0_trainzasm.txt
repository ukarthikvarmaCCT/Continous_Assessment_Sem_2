 Seeking to make p Chidambaram an accused, the petition was filed in the court by Janata Party President Dr Subrahmanyam Swamy
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda grahamantri 2ji ghotaale ke vakt vakt vitt mantri hua karte the
 On December 3, the court reserved the verdict after hearing Swamy's plea
 swami ke mutabik 2ji spactrum aavanton main gadabadiyon kii puri jaankaree pi chidambaram ko thi
 If they wanted, the scam could stop
 cese main chidambaram kii sanliptata sabit karne ke liye swami ne gavaahon se poochtacha karne kii maang kii thi
 On November 17, the CBI provided documents related to the scam to the owner on the court's order
 haalanki chidambaram ko sibiai hi nahin khud piem bhi clin chit de chuke hai
 But the finance ministry notes sent to the PMO indicate that the then finance minister Chidambaram was aware of what a Raja was doing in the name of spectrum allocation
 vitt mantralay ke tahat kaam karne vaale department of iconomic afares ne 25 march 2011 ko piemo ko ek memo bheja tha
 In this memo, important information is given about the 2G spectrum scam
 memo main likhaa gaya he 29 november 2007 ko telecom mantralay ne tu ji license par vitt mantralay ko chitthee likhi thi
 The letter also reached the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram on 9 January 2008
 chitthee vitt mantralay ke afasaron ne is suzav ke saath di ki 2 ji aavanton main entry fee revijan or nilaamee kii prakriya ko license dene kaa paimaana banaaya jaae
 It was also told that a meeting of the Telecom Commission will be held on 15 January 2008
 department of iconomic efferes ne is bare main telecom mantralay ko koi jawaab nahin bheja
 Nor was anything asked about the meeting
 maamla chidambaram kii jaankaree main aane ke agle hi din 10 janvari ko telecom mantri e raja ne nilaamee ke bajaay pehle aao pehle paao ke paimaane par 2 ji license baant die
 It is clear that Chidambaram was not unaware of the spectrum allocation, but can these facts make him an accused? The court has to decide

 vidhansabha main congress kii sankhya 27 he, jabaki bijepi ke paas 28 vidhayak hai
 Apart from its 27 mlas, the Congress also has the support of a six-member Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) and a nominated MLA, on whose strength it is likely to easily surpass the magical figure of 31 in the House

 Relieving Maharashtra's Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde, the anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) gave him a clean chit in connection with alleged irregularities in contracts worth about Rs 206 crore related to buying goods for school children
 asibi ke ek adhikari ne kaha, asibi ne maamla band kar diya he
 There was nothing to prove the charges leveled against him
 devendra fadanvis kii aguwai vaali bhaajapa-shivasena sarkaar ke khilaaf vipakshi congress or ensipi ne is kathith ghotaale ke aarope lagaae the
 Reacting to the clean chit he received, Pankaja said that the allegations were made to defame him
 pankaja ne kaha, maine kai baar kaha ki (chikki kharid main gadabadi) ke aaropon main koi dam nahin he
 i have responded to the allegations on several occasions in the assembly as well
 mahila evam bal kalyaan mantri ne kaha, jinhone aarope lagaae the unhen ‘chikki’ kharid main kaaphi gadabadiyaan dikhin jo (skool ke bacchon main) baante tak nahin gaye the
 He said, a betel nut was taken to defame me
 bhaajapa netaa ne haalanki un logon kaa naam nahin liya jo badnaam karne main shaamil hai
 Pankaja said, "my people always believed me despite the allegations against me
 mere rukh kii pushti hui he
 Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant had filed a complaint with the ACB last year accusing the minister and demanded an inquiry
 unhone aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye kuch dastavej bhi saunpe the
 However, Sawant alleged that 'ACB is acting under pressure from the state government
 agar vah swatantra rup se kaam nahin kar sakati to use band kar dena chahie
 She said that the Women and Child Welfare Department had issued 24 Government Proposals (grs) for purchase of goods worth Rs 206 crore which were 'illegal'
 saavant ne kaha ki asibi ne mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke dabaav main pankaja ko clin chit di
 He said the agency only heard the stance of those who were charged and gave a clean chit
 saavant ne asibi se apni jaanch report saarvajanik karne ko kaha

 ) Pankaja said, i have said many times that there is no merit in the (chikki purchase disturbances) allegations
 vidhansabha main bhi kai maukon par maine aaropon kaa jawaab diya he
 The Minister of Women and Child Welfare said those who made allegations found many flaws in 'chikki' purchases which were not even distributed (among the school children)
 unhone kaha, mujhe badnaam karne ke liye supaari lee gayi thi
 The BJP leader, however, did not name those who are involved in defaming him
 pankaja ne kaha, ‘‘mere logon ne mere khilaaf lage aaropon ke baavjood hameshaa mujh par vishwaas kiya

 PM Modi has given this responsibility to the 6 senior ministers
 jimmedaari paane vaale mantriyon main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, grih mantri rajnath singh, vitt mantri arun jetali, raksha mantri manohar parrikar, shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu or sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari shaamil hai, jo sabhi saansadon se milenge
 PM Modi clearly told the party mps that these 6 senior ministers will continue to discuss them
 mulaakaat kaa tarika bhi taypiem modi nemantriyo or saansdo kii mulaakaat kaa tarika bhi tay kar diya he
 The Minister will leave the state from which he will meet mps of other states for three to four hours on their lunch or tea
 modi ne apane saansdo se sabase mahatvapurn baat kahi ki wo dil kholkar apni baat in se kah sakate hai
 After preparing a separate report for the feedback of all the 6 senior ministers mps, Amit Shah will submit the report to the PM
 sutron kaa kahana he kii piem modi ye maanate hai ki sarkaar se judi har sakaraatmak yaa nakraatmak baat un tak nahin pahunch paati he
 Therefore, PM Modi believes that if mps openly discuss with their senior ministers, then there will be fair feedback about the government's policies, plans and programs
 kaibijepi saansdoka kahana ki ab wo bina dar ke apni baat or sarkaar ke bare main sahi feedback de sakate hai
 After the formation of the government, many BJP mps have complained not to PM Modi but to the party president Amit Shah, Organization General Secretary Ramlal and RSS leaders for not giving time to meet the ministers
 pichley saal bijepi sansadeey dal kii hi baithak main upi main baliya se saansad bharat singh ne piem kii maujuudagi main kaha tha ki mantri apni hi party ke saansdo ko mulaakaat kaa samay dena to dur unke phone bhi uplabdh nahin hote hai
 Bharat Singh further said that this is a danger bell for the government
 feedback se yojanaayen safal hogipiem modi ye baat achche se jaanate hai ki pichley do saal main unki sarkaar jitani nitiyaan or yojana banaai he ab unamem janata se aae feedback ke aadhaar par sudhaar karnaa hoga nahin to agle saal se sarkaar kii sabhi nitiyon or yojanaon ke nattejey dikhne lag jaaenge
 People who know PM Modi always say that one way of doing everything is different
 unki sarkaar main janata ke feedback par hi bhavishya kii ranneeti banaai jaati hai
 The PM believes that if the public feedback gets right, then no plan and government programs can fail
 ek baat saaf he ki agar is feedback kaarykram ko kahi bhi gadabad huin to uskaa khamiyaja piem modi ko hi nahin bijepi ke saansdo ko bhi bhugatna padegaa
 Prime Minister Modi is well aware of the fact that the speed at which the two years of the government has passed, will be multiplied even faster than the next three years

 The 24-year-old woman, married in a local influential political family in Jevrata Kalan village in Dausa district of Rajasthan, was distancing herself from politics
 unka dhyaan sthaneey college se bie kii padhai puri karne par tha
 But now she can become the sarpanch of this village with 4,500 voters
 unhen is saamaanya seat par apni jethaani binaa devi kii tarah aasaani se jeet milane kii sambhaavna he
 Bina, 29, won the sarpanch election in 2010, but this time she is not contesting
 sthaneey kaanaafoosee kii maane to binaa aathvin tak bhi nahin padhi hai
 However, she says that she is not contesting because her husband D

 Bairwa is in the battle of Pradhan from Dausa
 binaa ke shaikshanik yogyata na rakhane kii charchaa par kuch had tak vishwaas kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah sab vasundhara raaje sarkaar kii ore se 19 disambar ko jari ek vivaadaaspad adhyadesh kii vajah se hua he
 Through the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (second Amendment) Ordinance, 2014, a minimum educational qualification of all candidates for all posts other than the posts of Panch has been fixed in the local bodies elections to be held in January and February
 is adhyadesh ne rajya main sarpanch ke 9,900 padon par chunaav ladgaye ke liye binaa or kamalesh jaise pratyaashiyon ke liye 8veen tak kii shiksha anivaary kar di he
 For those contesting in 1,200 seats in notified areas, it has been made mandatory for them to pass the fifth by giving relaxation
 panchayat samiti sadasyon, pradhanon, jila parishad sadasyon or jila pramukhon kaa chunaav ladgaye waalon ke liye nunatam shaikshanik yogyata 10veen paas rakhi gai he
 There is a lot of controversy over this decision of the government
 sattarudh bijepi sarkaar ise pragatisheel kadam bataate hue daawa kar rahi he ki isse logon ko protsaahan milegaa
 Especially for rural areas that the people there to complete schooling
 duusari ore congress or vibhinn saamaajik sanghathanon ne ise manamaana kadam bataaya he
 Critics say that there is no minimum educational qualification condition in the assembly and parliament elections
 rajya congress adhyaksh sachin payalat kaa kahana he, ''nae kanoon se maujuuda panchayat samiti ke 70 fisadi sadsy or 55 fisadi jila parishad sadsy sharton ko puraa nahin kar paaenge
 Social organizations had filed a PIL in Rajasthan High Court against the ordinance through senior advocate Indira Jaisingh but the court refused to stay the election
 jaipur ke shor-sharabe se mahaj ek ghante kii duuri par payalat ke grih kshetra dausa main rahane vaale purv pradhan kishan laal bairava ise ek jabardast faisla bataate hai
 He is the brother-in-law of Bina and Kamlesh
 10veen tak padhe bairava kehete hai, ''nunatam shaikshanik yogyata kii shart bina soche-samajhe khadey ho jane vaale pratyaashiyon kii chantni kar degi or bavaal kam hoga
 Being educated makes one realize responsibility
 '' ve congress ke tikat par do baar vidhansabha chunaav bhi lade, lekin haar gaye the
 So is this Raje's game-changer or clever attempt to increase bjp's base in rural Rajasthan, which is considered to be the base of Congress? Both things are true to some extent
 raaje, grih mantri gulab chand kataaria or bijepi ke rajya adhyaksh ashok paranami ke bich hui ek baithak ke dauraan achaanak hi is tarah kaa adhyadesh laane kaa faisla liya gaya
 The Congress itself was showing interest in such an idea while in power
 par is vivaad kii vajah se yah vichaar chhod diya gaya tha ki sarpanch kaa chunaav ladgaye waalon par aisi shart thopanaa or saansadon, vidhayakon ko isse mukt rakhana bhedbhaavparak hoga
 Pilot told India Today, "I also want educated people to choose and come to the posts, but i would have done it in a phased manner
" jo log chunaav laduya chaahate hai, unako nunatam shaikshanik yogyata hasil karne ke liye paryaapt samay detaa
 He said that the government did not dare to present this amendment for debate in front of the Assembly as it feared its adverse effect in the villages
 vahiin bijepi ne anumaan lagaaya ki thodaa virodh hoga bhi to vah votaron ke bahut chote se varg tak simit hoga or chaahe congress ho yaa bijepi, nikaay chunaav ke zyaadaatar daavedaar iskaa samarthan karenge
 Through this ordinance, the BJP government wants to prove itself progressive, giving space to new and educated faces and also wanted to surprise the Congress in the electoral race
 paranami kehete hai, ''maine bijepi main tikat ke ek bhi daavedaar ko is adhyadesh kii shikaayat karte nahin suna
 The ordinance could not become a major issue either because the ball was thrown very cleverly
 yah sunishchit kiya gaya ki shaikshanik maandand ko sabase bade hisse yani kareeb 1,09,469 panch padon ke liye anivaary na kiya jaae
 At the same time, there are chances that hundreds of marksheets should be prepared overnight before and after the elections
 un markaits kii vaidhaniktaa par bhi shikaayatein darj ho sakati hai? aisa sanket jaipur se mahaj 40 kimi dur hi mil jaataa he
 Rajesh Sharma, who runs a grocery store in Mohanpura village, says emotionally, "if you win, you will get a thumb impression
" '' yahaan ke zyaadaatar logon kaa kahana he ki unke maujuuda lokapriy sarpanch kaalu ram meena padhe-likhe nahin hai
 Well 60-year-old Meena strongly denies this, "I have read till 8th and will fight again this time
" main sarkaar ke is faisle kaa samarthan karata hum, par isse vaise nirakshar budhimaan or samajhadaar log baahar ho jaaenge jinhone koi aupchaarik shiksha hasil nahin kii he
 Whereas bjp's Prem Singh Bazor, who became MLA for the second time, has a different opinion
 nirakshar prem ne bachapan main mazdooree se apni jindagi shuru kii thi or aaj ve sabase dhani vidhayakon main hai
 His total assets are Rs 100 crore

 He said, "if i had been educated, i would have done better in both politics and business
 '' isi vajah se unhone apni teen betiyon or ek bete ko padhaayaa-likhaaya
 They are demanding to set the criteria for similar educational qualifications for those who have fought the assembly and parliamentary elections
 vaise aupchaarik shiksha ko is tarah se tarjeeh milanaa 77 varshiya surya kanta vyas jaise logon ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Vyas has become the MLA for the fifth time only after getting primary education

 She says, "an honest illiterate is better than a corrupt graduate
" maine kai ucch shikshit mantriyon se behatar kaam kiya he
 "she recalls how in the 1995 Panchayati Raj elections, the condition of having only two children was imposed," even then many elected representatives had more than two children
 ''jaipur ke colector krishna kunal kehete hai ki donon faisle protsaahit karne ke liye the
 He says, "the condition of two children stopped the population growth in the state
" nunatam shaikshanik yogyata kii shart se skool chhodie kii dar main kami aegi
 "now the Education Department is raising a new slogan -" If the Sarpanch is to happen, the school has to be completed
 ' panchayat chunaavon ke nateezon se hi is faisle kaa bhavishya saaf ho paaegaa ki kya ise teji se vidhansabha kii ore le jaaya jaataa he yaa iske kadam sust pad jaaenge

 So when it came to making the film The Lion King as a live action, many big questions arose in the minds of the fans
 is film kaa parfect hona bahut jaruri tha kyonki yahaan baat sirf ek film kii nahin balki duniyabar ke logon ke bachapan kii he
 But Ficker Knot! Because director John Favreau is not in the mood to disappoint you at all

 # thelionking @disneyfilmsindiaa post shared byshah Rukh Khan(@iamsrk) onjul 10, 2019 at 9:45pm pdtwo da line king kaa live ection varjan shuru hota he gane cirkil of life se jo ki bilkul original anemated varjan jaisaa he
 Here we are talking about the Hindi version of The Lion King, so many things in the film were completely different
 film kii kahani aap jaanate hi hai, jangal ke raja mufasa sabhi kii raksha karte hai or sukh shanti banaae rakhte hai
 His brother Scar burns with them and wants to get the throne
 mufasa kaa betaa simba rajgaddi kaa asli hakdaar or wo hi bada hokar raja banegaa ye baat pehle se hi tay he
 Mufasa and Simba have a very deep relationship and both of these fathers and sons love each other immensely
 ek haadase main mufasa kii maut simba se sabakuch chin leti he, ab wo jindagi main aage kaise badhegaa yahi dekhne vaali baat he
 The film was being discussed for a long time and fans were eagerly waiting to hear the voice of Shahrukh Khan as Mufasa and his son Aryan Khan as Simba
 aapako ye jaanakar khushi hogi ki ye donon hi film main bemisaal hai
 Hearing the voice of Shahrukh Khan in the role of Mufasa in the teaser, many suspected that his voice might not fit the role, but it is not so
 shahrukh khan kii aawaaj ko is role ke hisaab se gaharaai di gai he jo mufasa ko suut kar rahi he
 Apart from this, while Aryan Khan's voice in the teaser sounded like Sem to Sem Shahrukh, the film is quite different from him
 itnaa hi nahin aapako aryan kaa kaam kaaphi pasand aayega kyonki unhone badhiya wois over diya he
 Apart from Shah Rukh and Aryan, the film lends its voice to Asrani for the role of Jaju, Shreyas Talpade for the role of Teemon, Sanjay Mishra for the character of Pumbaa and Ashish Vidyarthi for the character of Scar and all of them are unmatched
 khaskar ashish vidhyaarthee kii tarif honi banati he kyonki unhone skaar ke kirdaar main jis tarah jaan foonki he wo kamaal he
 How is the film Direction Talking about the film, John Favreau has made this film beautifully
 ye film dekhne main bilkul anemated varjan jaisi he, bas isaki khubsuurati iske asal duniya se jodatii he or aapako alag tarah kii khushi detii he
 The visuals of the film are amazing and the editing is quite crisp
 puraa jangal, timon or pumba kaa ghar, kaali ghati sabakuch pehle jaisaa he or aapako aapke bachapan ke us samay main lekar jaataa he jab aap tivi par simba ko dekha karte the
 Although there are some shortcomings in the film
 film kaa first half aapako thodaa slo lag saktaa he
 Apart from this, if you talk about Hindi songs, you will not enjoy listening to them at all
 singer armaan malik or sunidhi chouhan ne kaam acha kiya he, lekin is film ke gaanon main wo baat nahin he
 Its Hindi soundtrack is quite disappointing
 hakuna matata ke alaava aapako anya gaanon ke liriks yaad tak nahin rahete
 Overall this is a great film
 shahrukh khan or aryan khan kii aawaaj main is film ko dekhakar aapkaa dil jarur khush ho jayega
 It has always been a perfect film for children to enjoy
 to agar is weekend aapkaa man he to da line king ko ek chance jarur den

 congress kii lagaataar hui haar ke silsile kaa khamiyaja ab purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 In 1991, Manmohan Singh, an economist who started politics directly as finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government, first reached Parliament in Assam through the Rajya Sabha
 iske baad se manmohan singh lagaataar 5 baar rajyasabha ke liye chune jate rahe
 Meanwhile, Manmohan Singh also contested the Lok Sabha elections once, but lost
 piem pad par rahete hue bhi wo assam se rajyasabha saansad rahe, lekin ab 30 saal baad manmohan kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya he
 Manmohan Singh will not be seen in the Rajya Sabha in the coming session
 darasal, assam main congress or badaruddin ajmal kii party ke vidhayak milakar bhi pehali pasand ke 43 ke aankade tak nahin pahunche isliye is baar manmohan singh vahaan se saansad nahin ban sakate hai
 Whereas according to senior Congress leaders, economist and veteran Manmohan Singh is needed in the Parliament, so the party would like him to return to Parliament as soon as possible
 lekin dikkat ye he ki jin jagahon main rajyasabha ke chunaav hai, vahaan congress ke paas jaruri number nahin hai
 The Congress strategists are trying to get the Congress to join Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu for Manmohan with DMK, but the discussion has not reached success so far

 On Diwali, the people of Delhi did a lot of fireworks but the next morning the capital of the country started to flourish

 Breathing air so hard
 ye dilli main diwali ke jashn kaa said effect he
 
 pradooshan kaa str khatre ke suchakank ko todakar bahut upar ja chukaa he
 On the one hand the government continued to conduct awareness campaigns and issued guidelines, while on the other hand people started blowing it in smoke
 desh kii rajdhani kaa sabase pradooshit ilaaka purvi dilli rahaa
 Especially in Anand Vihar people enjoyed the Diwali fireworks more
 ab nateeja saamne he
 The nitrogen oxide content here was estimated at 1273 micrograms per cubic meter
 jo tay kiye gaye maanak se bahut zyada he
 RK Puram area of south Delhi was second in terms of pollution
 yahaan nitrogen oxide 650 microgram prati cubic meter pai gai
 Punjabi Bagh in West Delhi was the third most polluted area with 361 micrograms of nitrogen oxide
 dhuen or dhul kii maatra bhi anand vihaar main sabase zyada pai gai
 It was 18 times more than normal
 jabaki aar ke puram main ye maatra 9 saamaanya se 9 guna zyada thi
 Surprisingly, the educated people of Delhi were at the forefront of fire crackers
 masalan purvi dilli or aar ke puram jaise ilaako main sabase zyada aatishbaajee hui
 RK Puram has the highest number of government employees
 upar se pehle hi unase ye apil kii ja chuki thi ki log pataakhe kam chalaaen

 The central government will once again introduce three divorce bills with amendments in the Rajya Sabha on the last day of the monsoon session
 guuruuvaar ko modi cabinet ne is bill main sanshodhan kiye hai, jiske baad ab bill ke paas hone kii ummid jataai ja rahi he
 Earlier, the Congress had made several shortcomings in this bill, after which the bill was amended
 teen talaak bill main kiye gaye ye sanshodhan- trial se pehle peedita kaa paksh sunakar magistrate de saktaa he aaropee ko jamaanat
 - Only the victim, family and relatives of the blood can file an FIR
 - magistrate ko pati-patni ke bich samjhauta karakar shaadi barkaraar rakhane kaa adhikaar hoga
 Right to compensation for women suffering three divorce bills at once, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that these amendments were necessary in some divorce bills
 isliye cabinet ne in sanshodhano ko manzuri di he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad also said that in 2017, a total of 389 cases of triple talaq were reported and 160 cases have come up after the judgment from the Supreme Court
 aaj modi sarkaar kii koshish hogi ki rajyasabha main teen talaak bill ko nae sanshodhano ke saath paas karake aaj hi loksabhaa se paas karake ise kanoon kaa rup diya jaae
 In the last session, the opposition proposed to send the bill to the Select Committee, stating some deficiencies
 sarkaar ne ise nahin mana tha
 After which this bill was uprooted
 piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne teen talaak par congress ko gherne kii jo ranneeti banaai he uske mutabik agar congress is bill kaa samarthan karti he to unke muslim vot bank par 100 pratishat asar padegaa
 If the Congress opposes the bill once again, then the BJP will try to give the message across the country that the Congress is not supporting women suffering from triple talaq due to vote bank politics
 jis tarah se ravishankar prasad ne sonia gandhi se sawaal poocha he ki muslim mahilaon ke sammaan ke liye is bill ke samarthan ke liye khadi hongi yaa nahin ? iskaa matlab saaf he ki sansad ke is satr main teen talaaq bill paas nahin hota he to sarkaar iske congress ko jimmedaar bataaegi
 Looking at the kind of strategy that PM Modi and Amit Shah have devised for the triple talaq, it seems that they will get the benefit of the triple talaq bill in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and its direct loss to the Congress

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne rashtriya rajdhani ke varisht nagarikon ke liye 'mukhyamantri tirth yatra yojana' ko manjuuri de di he
 Earlier, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had instructed the Delhi government regarding this scheme and asked to reconsider
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne up rajyapal dwaara lagaai gai aapattiyon ko darkinar karte hue yojana ko hari jhandi de di
 Citizens above the age of 60 years will be able to take advantage of this scheme
 iske tahat dilli sarkaar har saal 77 hajaar varisht nagarikon ko muft main tirth yatra karaayegi
 The Delhi government had fixed five routes for this pilgrimage scheme, which include mathura-vrindavan, haridwar-rishikesh-neelkanth, pushkar-ajmer, amritsar-bagha-anandpur Sahib and Vaishno devi-jammu
 tirth yatriyon ko teen din or do raat kii yatra par in tay dharmik sthanon par bheja jayega
 Announcing the plan, Delhi Revenue Minister Kailash Gehlot said that the scheme was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on January 8, 2018, but some observations were made on behalf of the Lt
 Governor
 is vajah se ise ab tak lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa tha
 Under the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana, 1100 pilgrims will be offered various pilgrimage visits every year from every assembly
 is yojana ke liye sarkaar ne kuch sharten rakhi hai, jiske mutabik yatra par jane vaale varisht nagarikon ko dilli kaa nivasee hona chahie

 yatra par jane vaale varisht naagarik apane saath 18 saal se adhik umr kaa ek sahyogi bhi le ja sakenge, jiskaa bhi puraa kharch sarkaar uthaaegi
 However government officials and employees will not get the benefit of this scheme
 aniyamittaaon se bachane ke liye sarkaar ne ek or praavdhaan kiya he, jiske tahat is yojana kaa laabh uthaane vaale vyakti ko self certification se bataanaa hoga ki usne sabhi sahi suchanaaen di hai or usne pehle is yojana kaa laabh nahin uthaaya he
 The Delhi government will also provide insurance of one lakh to the citizens going on pilgrimage
 yatra par aane-jane se lekar rahane khaane kii vyavastha sarkaar karegi
 The government will select the citizens who are going to travel, through online applications, who will meet the office of the Divisional Commissioner or the office of the MLA of the area
 lottery ke jariye har saal dilli se 77 hajaar varisht nagarikon kaa chayan kiya jayega or vidhayakon ko pramanit karnaa hoga ki sambandhit varisht naagarik unke kshetra se hai
 The scheme is also being seen by Kejriwal linking it to the 2019 general elections
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kejariwal is yojana ke jariye hindu vot bank ko apane paksh main karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Under these 10 points, understand the complete plan 1

 sarkari adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko is yojana kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 5
 is yojana kaa laabh uthaane vaale vyakti ko self certification se bataanaa hoga ki usne sabhi sahi suchanaaen di hai or usne pehle is yojana kaa laabh nahin uthaaya he
 6
 tirthayatra ke chaynit vyaktiyon kaa ek lakh rupee kaa beemaa hoga
 7
 asi bason se tirthayatra karai jaaegi
 Food and breakfast will also be arranged by the government

 Diandra will tell that Karishma wanted to talk to her mother more than to liberate Puneet
 jabaki dimpi kii sirf ek hi ichha thi
 Bigg Boss: Sushant is out of the house saying that Karishma says that it would be wrong to say that because she first asked Puneet to be free and Diandra misunderstood him
 donon ke bich koi samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa
 But it is clear that something has come to mind about Diandra
 diyandra samajhane kii koshish karengi dekhen yah koshish kitni kaam aegi

 aa gaye upachunaav ke nattejey
 In what was being said to be an examination of Modi Magic, BJP was the farm
 kam se kam media kaa to yahi farmaan hua he
 Alleged experts debating the by-elections in TV studios are landing in the sea of happiness
 ye vahi export hai, jo bijepi brand kii raajnneeti ko zyada pasand nahin karte hai
 And they are openly criticizing the bjp's strategy
 ye bataa rahe hai ki may 2014 ke chunaav main uttar pradesh main baaki dalon kaa supada saaf karne vaali bijepi kaise is baar buree tarah haari
 And in the zeal of his analysis, all these poll pundits are now refusing even the unsolicited advice to the BJP
 inke bich kam se kam is baar vichaaron kii samanta najar aa rahi he
 Everyone is telling the BJP that it should abandon its radical Hindutva electoral strategy
 ye kah rahe hai ki bijepi ko agar apana may vaala karishma doharaana he to vibhaajankaree raajnneeti se baj aana chahie
 These analysts argue that the BJP fought and won the Lok Sabha elections by giving slogans of development and good governance
 ye samajhane ke liye bahut dimag kharch nahin karnaa padegaa ki ye vishleshak mithyaa ugal rahe hai
 Their assessment is growing on the ground of misunderstanding
 bijepi ko salaah yaa phir khushrahmipahali baat, ye sach bahut saaf he ki ye vishleshak bijepi ke shubh chintak nahin hai
 Some of them brand themselves as openly anti-bjp thinkers
 to aise main wo bijepi ko koi aisi salaah kyon denge, jisase uski vijay pataakaa fahraae
 Secondly, BJP did not win Lok Sabha elections on the issue of development and governance
 ye ek kism kaa myth he, jise in pole panditon ne baar baar prachaarit kiya
 The BJP also never openly denied it
 aise main ye samaj nahin aata ki ye bijepi virdohi dhurandhar ab use samaveshi raajnneeti karne kii salaah kyon de rahe hai
 In fact, they want that religion-based issues should not get stressed, especially in the Hindi belt or Hindu-dominated areas
 ye chaahate hai ki bijepi ek udaar or sabhi ko saath lekar chalane vaala raajnneetik vikalp bane
 And under this wish or desire, he wants the BJP to follow his advice and change his costume
 ye chaahate hai ki bijepi aisi party ban jaae ki ve use vot de saken
 This is a trick in thinking or wishing that the ruling party can hold on
 pech yah ki ye sab to salaah dekar sarak lenge, magar maidan par asal ladaai bijepi ko ladani hogi
 And the BJP kept on becoming their dream party
 bijepi narendra modi ke sapanom kii party he
 He is adapting the organization according to his thinking
 or aisa karne main amit shah unki madad kar rahe hai
 And both these leaders are not known for their liberal views
 jab ugr mulymiyat kaa mulammaa odhata hamodi ke aalochak chaahate hai ki vah apni satta or prabhaav kaa istemaal ghrinaa failaane vaale bayaan veeron masalan, yogi adityanath yaa phir lakshmikant vaajapeyi ko chup karaane main karen
 These critics want communal harmony to remain
 ye nahin chaahate ki bijepi lav jehad kaa mudda jor shor se uthaae
 They want the BJP to become secular and progressive
 samanvay kaa madhya maarg apanaae
 They want the BJP to become Congress
 taaki ye use pyaar kar saken
 To join his stream of power
 or aisa karne ke dauraan unhen kisi kism kaa afsos na ho
 If the face of the crocodile is not covered
 inke vishleshanon main achaanak se narendra modi yaa amit shah ke udaaravaadi hone kii shubhechha prakat hone lagi he
 They feel that Modi and Shah are fine, but the Yogis of Gorakhpur are staunch
 vah ugr hindutv ke agenda ko aage badha rahe hai
 These are the same liberals who till yesterday were calling Advani as liberal and secular and Modi as violent and communal
 or usase bhi peeche lauten to ye vahi log hai jo adwani ko vaajapeyi ke mukaable kattar bataate the
 This is a pattern in which it is repeatedly told that the political ground of liberals in the ruling party is shrinking and the extremist elements are grabbing it
 or agar karen upi kii batupi main bijepi ne dhuandhar safalataa hasil kii
 It was not that the people of Uttar Pradesh suddenly woke up from sleep and decided to stop development and good governance
 agar ye janata kaa sthaayee bhav hota to vah 2012 ke pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main samaajawaadee party ke jati-dharm ke formule ko sweekaar use satta kii chaabi na saunpti
 The Hindi belt entrusted the throne to Modi because he liked the aggressive Hindutva of Modi and the acrobatics of development
 modi ek aise hindu netaa ke taur par ubhare, jo phijul kii secular stantbaaji nahin karata
 Unlike SP and Congress, minority welfare is not in vain
 middle class kii takalifon par unke sapanom par dhyaan detaa he
 And the greatest thing is the result
 ab chunavi chanakya ye samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki jis upi kii janata ne kuch maheene pehle bijepi ko itnaa bada janadesh diya, vah achaanak bidak kyon gai
 The answer is that the public did not need it in the by-elections
 unhen pataa tha ki in chunaavon se soobe kii haalat main koi badlaav nahin aane vaala he
 It also has low voting percentage in elections
 isaki taraf najar daaliye
 Recall the attachment of local authority
 or paheli sulajh jaaegi
 The bjp's voter did not get as excited in these elections as it was not an exercise for change
 ye to yathasthiti main kuch judaav ghataav bhar kii thi
 On the other hand, despite taking charge of governance in the state, the Samajwadi Party looked marginalized
 isliye usne in chunaavon main apana sab kuch jhonk diya taaki uski raajnneetik praasangikta bachi rahe
 Sorry to blow your balloon, critics of Humbizip feel that this party will learn from these election results
 apni vibhaajankaree nitiyon ko chhod degaa
 Will change your attitude
 afsos ve haath masalate rah jaaenge
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Modi emerged as the master of fiery Hindutva
 unhone ise gujarat model ke vikaas kii packing ke saath pesh kiya
 But how much packing is important
 asal cheez to andar kaa maal he
 Hindutva is a permanent feature of the BJP
 uski raajnneeti kaa mul he
 Liberals should be happy with anything, the truth is that now the politics of this brand will be more intense
 dhruvikaran or bhi tatparta ke saath hoga
 And its election results will also be visible
 shaayad tab, jab uski sabase zyada jarurat ho
 Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath, all of them are singing the same tune
 bas tivi studio main baithe aalochak inhen alag alag dhang se sunne kaa dhong kar rahe hai
 You can also follow India Today Group Digital's Managing Editor, Kamlesh Singh on Twitter
 unka twitor handle he@kamleshksingh Who can forget that picture of Kim Phuc running naked on a street in South Vietnam
 nau saal kii kim ke saath kuch or bachche bhaag rahe hai
 At the end of the road there is a swirl of black smoke after the bombings
 yuddh kii tabaahi kaa yah kaala sach duniya ke saamne nahin aata, agar photographer nik ne himmat karke vah tasviir na lee hoti
 Not only did Nick take the picture, but Kim picked him up and took him to the hospital
 jahaan kim kaa ilaaj hua or vah batch gai
 Today Kim has two children and lives in Toronto
 kim ne apane chalisven janmdin par kaha tha ki is tasviir ke jariye main duniya ke liye ummid hum
 The photo received a Pulitzer Prize
 ek or tasviir he sudan kii
 Hunger has made even a small girl helpless
 vah zamin par padi hui he or usase kuch duuri par ek bada sa giddh (vulture) ghur rahaa he
 When this picture of Kevin Carter appeared in the New York Times in 1993, there was a worldwide uproar
 log poochne lage ki us bacchee kaa kya hua
 Did the photographer try to save her
 yah patrakarita ke itihaas kaa sabase vivaadit prasang he, jiske kai pahalu hai
 This photo had put the terrible picture of hunger in front of the whole world
 carter ko bhi is photo ke liye pulitzer puraskaar mila
 These are two different situations
 ek sthiti main photographer apane kirdaar kii madad karata he or duusari sthiti main madad nahin karata, magar donon ko pulitzer puraskaar miltaa he
 In both cases the whole world is shaken
 jaise jantar-mantar par gajendra kii aatmahatya ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke prati puure desh kii udaseenta ko jhakzor diya he
 Everything has been exposed
 dhai lakh se zyada kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sarkari ricard ko ham bas ek kagaz kaa aankada maanane lage the
 Gajendra's photographs have brought millions of farmers who committed suicide alive to the whole country
 maine jin do tasveeron kaa zikr kiya he, unhen bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan (indian Institute of Mass Communication) ke professor anand pradhan prime time ke ek sho main lekar aae the
 We were discussing what a journalist should do on such an occasion
 yah hamaare peshey kii naitikta (ethics) kii sabase badi duvidha he
 There can be no definite answer
 patrkaar reporter yaa photographer se pehle insaan bhi he, lekin yah uskaa kaam bhi he ki vah maukey kii tasviir ko thik us tarah se darj karata chale, jo insaaniyat ke liye kaam aa sakati he
 There can be many types of situations
 sthiti tay karegi ki patrkaar kya karegaa, na ki koi kitaab
 At the Aam Aadmi Party's Kisan rally at Jantar Mantar, Gajendra Singh committed suicide in front of everyone
 vah kisi sanmdar ke bich nahin tha yaa kisi baadh main yaa kisi pul ke neeche bhi nahin tha yaa vah kisi bahumanjila imaarat kii chat par nahin yaa vah chalati train ke bilkul neeche nahin aa gaya tha
 He was already sitting on the tree, which was also requested to be removed
 jise camere se lekar vahaan maujuud sainkadon logon ne dekha
 The police also saw who should have the necessary resources, especially when the Chief Minister was meeting
 ehtiyaat ke taur par fire brigade se lekar ambulance kii gaadi to honi hi chahie
 Now it should tell Delhi government that ambulance will send police or work of government hospital
 kya mukhyamantri karyaalay ne raily ke intazaam ko lekar ye sab sawaal puche the
 It was reported in the media that the police has been told that the Chief Minister should be kept away from journalists
 main isaki pushti nahin kar saktaa, lekin kisi bhi raily se party or police ke bich kai str par samvaad hota he
 There is also a face-to-face meeting
 ab bahes ho rahi he ki vahaan khadi media ko gajendra kii jaan bachaane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie tha
 i was not at Jantar Mantar nor have i spoken to any journalist present there
 phir bhi yah bahes bataa rahi he ki log maukey par ham patrakaron ke vyavhaar ko lekar kitne sanjeeda hai
 The politicians sitting on the stage made a voice to save, but did not run
 unke paas to mike bhi tha, police ko awaz lagaai, magar police ne gajendra ko nahin utaara
 What should have been done to the hundreds of journalists standing there
 agar sabko yaa kisi bhi ek ko apane camere main dikh rahaa he ki koi aadmi fanda daal rahaa he to kya karnaa chahie
 Who knows, a journalist may have made a voice, or what address, nobody has cared
 iskaa jawaab itnaa saral nahin he
 Before asking this question, we must see what the situation is
 agar kisi pul se koi photographer tasviir le rahaa he to vah kya kare
 Do not know how to swim, yet if you drown or swim, then jump in a fast stream
 vahaan khadey kitne patrakaron ko ped par chadhana aata hoga, ise lekar main aashwast nahin hum, magar yah ek zaruri sawaal he
 What should a photographer do if a hut is on fire? kya use rajendra kumaar kii tarah jhonpadi main kud janaa chahie or bachche ko uthaakar laana chahie
 It is very difficult to say all this, because whether the journalist is competent or not is a question
 patrkaar kaa ek kaam to yah hona hi chahie ki report karte hue vah tamaam agenciyon ko alert karata rahe
 The comments par aisa nahin hona chahie ki ham netaaon, police or logon se poochhate-poochhate thak jaaen to ulta press se hi poochne lagen
 The only thing i can say in this situation is that there was no extraordinary situation at Jantar Mantar
 ped par chadhane kaa jokhim na lete hue bhi logon ko alert kiya ja saktaa tha
 If anyone has seen this happening with his camera, he should have created a ruckus
 press ke baaki saathiyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chahie tha or recording rokkar vahaan vyavdhaan paidaa karnaa chahie tha, taaki sab gajendra kii jaan bachaane ke liye tatpar ho sake
 Everyone's failure is also the press's failure, but for this, it has to be factually known whether no one has actually alerted anyone there
 main vahaan tha nahin, isliye daawey se nahin kah saktaa
 If you say that the way the press reported, was it fair, then it can be given definite answers and accountability can be fixed
 gajendra to us ped par ab nahin he, magar camaron ke liye ab bhi vah ped zindaa he, jiske neeche khadey hokar reporter ab bhi news room ke aadesh par naatak kar rahe hai ki yahi vah ped he, jisaki ek tahani se gajendra latak gaya tha
 This is the tree that the leaders sitting on the platform kept watching
 ek din hamaare channel ped ko hi kasuurvaar tehra denge
 This is the tree that allowed Gazendra to hang
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gajendra kii jaan le lee
 Do not forget that we are living in the era of Peepli Live
 dakshin vietnam kii ek sadak par nangi bhaagti kim phuk (kim Phuc) kii us tasviir ko koun bhul saktaa he
 Nine-year-old Kim has a few more children running away
 sadak ke antim chor par bam dhamaake ke baad uthaa hua kaale dhuen kaa gubaar he
 This dark truth of the devastation of war would not have been revealed to the world, if the photographer Nick had not dared to take that picture
 nik ne na sirf tasviir lee, balki kim ko uthaakar aspataal bhi le gaye
 Where Kim was treated and she survived
 aaj kim ke do bachche hai or wo toronto main rahati hai
 Kim said on her forties that through this picture, i am hopeful for the world
 is photo ko pulitzer puraskaar mila tha
 Another picture is of Sudan
 bhukh ne ek choti bacchee ko chalane se bhi laachaar bana diya he
 She is lying on the ground and is staring a large vulture at some distance from it
 kevin carter kii yah tasviir jab 1993 main neuyark times main chhapi to duniya bhar main hangaamaa much gaya
 People started asking what happened to that girl
 kya photographer ne use bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 It is the most controversial topic in the history of journalism, which has many aspects
 is photo ne bhukh kii bhayaavah tasviir puri duniya ke saamne rakh di thi
 Carter also received a Pulitzer Prize for this photo
 ye do alag-alag sthitiyaan hai
 In one situation the photographer helps his character and in the other situation does not help, but both receive the Pulitzer Prize
 donon hi sthitiyon main puri duniya hill jaati he
 For example, Gajendra's suicide at Jantar Mantar has shaken the indifference of the entire country towards farmers' suicide
 sab ke sab expos ho gaye hai
 We were just beginning to consider the government record of suicide of more than two and a half lakh farmers as a paper
 gajendra kii tasveeron ne aatmahatya karne vaale lakhon kisaanon ko puure desh ke saamne zindaa kar diya he
 The two pictures i have mentioned were brought to me by Professor Pradhan of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication at a prime time show
 ham charchaa kar rahe the ki is tarah ke maukey par kisi patrkaar ko kya karnaa chahie
 This is the biggest dilemma of the ethics of our profession
 iskaa koi ek nishchit uttar nahin ho saktaa he
 a journalist is a human being before a reporter or a photographer, but it is also his job to keep recording the photograph of the occasion in a way that can be useful for humanity
 kai prakaar kii sthiti ho sakati he
 The situation will decide what the journalist will do, not a book
 jantar-mantar par aam aadmi party kii kisaan raily main gajendra singh ne sabake saamne aatmahatya kar lee
 He was not in the middle of any memory or in any flood or under any bridge or he was not on the roof of a multi-storied building or he did not fall under the moving train at all
 vah pehle se ped par baitha tha, jise utaarne kii apil bhi hui
 Which was seen by hundreds of people present from the camera
 police ne bhi dekha, jiske paas zaruri saadhan hone chahie, khaskar tab, jab mukhyamantri kii sabha ho rahi ho
 As a precaution, there should be a train from fire brigade to ambulance
 ab yah dilli sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki ambulance police bhejegi yaa sarkari aspataal kaa kaam he
 Did the Chief Minister's Office ask all these questions regarding the arrangement of the rally
 media main yah to khabar ai thi ki police se kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko patrakaron se dur rakhaa jaae
 i cannot confirm this, but at any rally, there is a level of dialogue between the party and the police
 aamane-saamne kii baithak bhi hoti he
 It is now being debated that the media standing there should have tried to save Gajendra's life
 main jantar-mantar par nahin tha or na hi vahaan maujuud kisi patrkaar se baat hui he
 Yet this debate is telling how serious people are about the behavior of journalists on the occasion
 vahaan manch par baithe rajanetaaon ne bachaane ke liye awaz to lagaai, magar daud nahin lagaai
 He also had a mike, gave a call to the police, but the police did not field Gajendra
 vahaan khadey saikadon patrakaron ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 What should be done if everyone or any one is seen in their camera that a man is putting a noose
 kya pataa, kisi patrkaar ne awaz lagaai bhi ho, yaa kya pataa, kisi ne parvaah hi nahin kii ho
 The answer is not so simple
 ham yah sawaal poochne se pehle zarur dekhen ki sthiti kya he
 What to do if a photographer is taking a picture from a bridge
 tairnaa nahin aata he, phir bhi dub jaae yaa tairnaa aata bhi he to tej dhara main kud jaae
 i am not sure how many journalists standing there would have climbed the tree, but this is an important question
 agar kisi jhonpadi main aag lagi he to photographer ko kya karnaa chahie
 Should he jump into the hut like Rajendra Kumar and bring the child up
 bahut mushkil he yah sab kahana, kyonki patrkaar sakasham he yaa nahin, yah ek sawaal to he
 The job of a journalist must be that while reporting, he would alert all agencies
 tippaniyan But it should not happen that when we get tired of asking the leaders, police and people, then we start asking the press instead
 is sthiti main main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki jantar-mantar par koi asaadhaaran sthiti nahin thi
 People could be alerted even without taking the risk of climbing the tree
 agar kisi ne apane camere se aisa hote hue dekha he, to use hangaamaa karnaa chahie tha
 It should have caught the attention of the rest of the press colleagues and created a disruption there by stopping the recording, so that everyone could be ready to save Gajendra's life
 sabaki naakaami main press kii bhi naakaami he, lekin iske liye yah tathyaatmak rup se jaananaa hoga ki kya vaaki vahaan kisi ne kisi ko alert nahin kiya
 i was not there, so cannot say with the claim
 agar aap yah kahen ki press ne jis tarah se reporting kii, kya vah uchit tha, to iske nishchit jawaab die ja sakate hai or javabdehi tay kii ja sakati he
 Gajendra is no longer on that tree, but that tree is still alive for the cameras, standing under it, the reporters are still pretending on the order of the news room that this is the tree that Gajendra was hanging from a branch
 
 yahi vah ped he, jise manch par baithe netaa dekhte rahe
 One day, our channel will make the tree guilty
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gazendra ko latakane diya
 This is the tree that killed Gajendra
 mat bhuuliega ki ham pipli live ke daur main ji rahe hai
 Another picture is of Sudan
 bhukh ne ek choti bacchee ko chalane se bhi laachaar bana diya he
 She is lying on the ground and is staring a large vulture at some distance from it
 kevin carter kii yah tasviir jab 1993 main neuyark times main chhapi to duniya bhar main hangaamaa much gaya
 People started asking what happened to that girl
 kya photographer ne use bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 It is the most controversial topic in the history of journalism, which has many aspects
 is photo ne bhukh kii bhayaavah tasviir puri duniya ke saamne rakh di thi
 Carter also received a Pulitzer Prize for this photo
 ye do alag-alag sthitiyaan hai
 In one situation the photographer helps his character and in the other situation does not help, but both receive the Pulitzer Prize
 donon hi sthitiyon main puri duniya hill jaati he
 For example, Gajendra's suicide at Jantar Mantar has shaken the indifference of the entire country towards farmers' suicide
 sab ke sab expos ho gaye hai
 We were just beginning to consider the government record of suicide of more than two and a half lakh farmers as a paper
 gajendra kii tasveeron ne aatmahatya karne vaale lakhon kisaanon ko puure desh ke saamne zindaa kar diya he
 The two pictures i have mentioned were brought to me by Professor Pradhan of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication at a prime time show
 ham charchaa kar rahe the ki is tarah ke maukey par kisi patrkaar ko kya karnaa chahie
 This is the biggest dilemma of the ethics of our profession
 iskaa koi ek nishchit uttar nahin ho saktaa he
 a journalist is a human being before a reporter or a photographer, but it is also his job to keep recording the photograph of the occasion in a way that can be useful for humanity
 kai prakaar kii sthiti ho sakati he
 The situation will decide what the journalist will do, not a book
 jantar-mantar par aam aadmi party kii kisaan raily main gajendra singh ne sabake saamne aatmahatya kar lee
 He was not in the middle of any memory or in any flood or under any bridge or he was not on the roof of a multi-storied building or he did not fall under the moving train at all
 vah pehle se ped par baitha tha, jise utaarne kii apil bhi hui
 Which was seen by hundreds of people present from the camera
 police ne bhi dekha, jiske paas zaruri saadhan hone chahie, khaskar tab, jab mukhyamantri kii sabha ho rahi ho
 As a precaution, there should be a train from fire brigade to ambulance
 ab yah dilli sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki ambulance police bhejegi yaa sarkari aspataal kaa kaam he
 Did the Chief Minister's Office ask all these questions regarding the arrangement of the rally
 media main yah to khabar ai thi ki police se kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko patrakaron se dur rakhaa jaae
 i cannot confirm this, but at any rally, there is a level of dialogue between the party and the police
 aamane-saamne kii baithak bhi hoti he
 It is now being debated that the media standing there should have tried to save Gajendra's life
 main jantar-mantar par nahin tha or na hi vahaan maujuud kisi patrkaar se baat hui he
 Yet this debate is telling how serious people are about the behavior of journalists on the occasion
 vahaan manch par baithe rajanetaaon ne bachaane ke liye awaz to lagaai, magar daud nahin lagaai
 He also had a mike, gave a call to the police, but the police did not field Gajendra
 vahaan khadey saikadon patrakaron ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 What should be done if everyone or any one is seen in their camera that a man is putting a noose
 kya pataa, kisi patrkaar ne awaz lagaai bhi ho, yaa kya pataa, kisi ne parvaah hi nahin kii ho
 The answer is not so simple

 i was not there, so cannot say with the claim
 agar aap yah kahen ki press ne jis tarah se reporting kii, kya vah uchit tha, to iske nishchit jawaab die ja sakate hai or javabdehi tay kii ja sakati he
 Gajendra is no longer on that tree, but that tree is still alive for the cameras, standing under it, the reporters are still pretending on the order of the news room that this is the tree that Gajendra was hanging from a branch
 
 yahi vah ped he, jise manch par baithe netaa dekhte rahe
 One day, our channel will make the tree guilty
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gazendra ko latakane diya
 This is the tree that killed Gajendra
 mat bhuuliega ki ham pipli live ke daur main ji rahe hai
 These are two different situations
 ek sthiti main photographer apane kirdaar kii madad karata he or duusari sthiti main madad nahin karata, magar donon ko pulitzer puraskaar miltaa he
 In both cases the whole world is shaken
 jaise jantar-mantar par gajendra kii aatmahatya ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke prati puure desh kii udaseenta ko jhakzor diya he
 Everything has been exposed
 dhai lakh se zyada kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sarkari ricard ko ham bas ek kagaz kaa aankada maanane lage the
 Gajendra's photographs have brought millions of farmers who committed suicide alive to the whole country
 maine jin do tasveeron kaa zikr kiya he, unhen bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan (indian Institute of Mass Communication) ke professor anand pradhan prime time ke ek sho main lekar aae the
 We were discussing what a journalist should do on such an occasion
 yah hamaare peshey kii naitikta (ethics) kii sabase badi duvidha he
 There can be no definite answer
 patrkaar reporter yaa photographer se pehle insaan bhi he, lekin yah uskaa kaam bhi he ki vah maukey kii tasviir ko thik us tarah se darj karata chale, jo insaaniyat ke liye kaam aa sakati he
 There can be many types of situations
 sthiti tay karegi ki patrkaar kya karegaa, na ki koi kitaab
 At the Aam Aadmi Party's Kisan rally at Jantar Mantar, Gajendra Singh committed suicide in front of everyone
 vah kisi sanmdar ke bich nahin tha yaa kisi baadh main yaa kisi pul ke neeche bhi nahin tha yaa vah kisi bahumanjila imaarat kii chat par nahin yaa vah chalati train ke bilkul neeche nahin aa gaya tha
 He was already sitting on the tree, which was also requested to be removed
 jise camere se lekar vahaan maujuud sainkadon logon ne dekha
 The police also saw who should have the necessary resources, especially when the Chief Minister was meeting
 ehtiyaat ke taur par fire brigade se lekar ambulance kii gaadi to honi hi chahie
 Now it should tell Delhi government that ambulance will send police or work of government hospital
 kya mukhyamantri karyaalay ne raily ke intazaam ko lekar ye sab sawaal puche the
 It was reported in the media that the police has been told that the Chief Minister should be kept away from journalists
 main isaki pushti nahin kar saktaa, lekin kisi bhi raily se party or police ke bich kai str par samvaad hota he
 There is also a face-to-face meeting
 ab bahes ho rahi he ki vahaan khadi media ko gajendra kii jaan bachaane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie tha
 i was not at Jantar Mantar nor have i spoken to any journalist present there
 phir bhi yah bahes bataa rahi he ki log maukey par ham patrakaron ke vyavhaar ko lekar kitne sanjeeda hai
 The politicians sitting on the stage made a voice to save, but did not run
 unke paas to mike bhi tha, police ko awaz lagaai, magar police ne gajendra ko nahin utaara
 What should have been done to the hundreds of journalists standing there
 agar sabko yaa kisi bhi ek ko apane camere main dikh rahaa he ki koi aadmi fanda daal rahaa he to kya karnaa chahie
 Who knows, a journalist may have made a voice, or what address, nobody has cared
 iskaa jawaab itnaa saral nahin he
 Before asking this question, we must see what the situation is
 agar kisi pul se koi photographer tasviir le rahaa he to vah kya kare
 Do not know how to swim, yet if you drown or swim, then jump in a fast stream
 vahaan khadey kitne patrakaron ko ped par chadhana aata hoga, ise lekar main aashwast nahin hum, magar yah ek zaruri sawaal he
 What should a photographer do if a hut is on fire? kya use rajendra kumaar kii tarah jhonpadi main kud janaa chahie or bachche ko uthaakar laana chahie
 It is very difficult to say all this, because whether the journalist is competent or not is a question
 patrkaar kaa ek kaam to yah hona hi chahie ki report karte hue vah tamaam agenciyon ko alert karata rahe
 The comments par aisa nahin hona chahie ki ham netaaon, police or logon se poochhate-poochhate thak jaaen to ulta press se hi poochne lagen
 The only thing i can say in this situation is that there was no extraordinary situation at Jantar Mantar
 ped par chadhane kaa jokhim na lete hue bhi logon ko alert kiya ja saktaa tha
 If anyone has seen this happening with his camera, he should have created a ruckus
 press ke baaki saathiyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chahie tha or recording rokkar vahaan vyavdhaan paidaa karnaa chahie tha, taaki sab gajendra kii jaan bachaane ke liye tatpar ho sake
 Everyone's failure is also the press's failure, but for this, it has to be factually known whether no one has actually alerted anyone there
 main vahaan tha nahin, isliye daawey se nahin kah saktaa
 If you say that the way the press reported, was it fair, then it can be given definite answers and accountability can be fixed
 gajendra to us ped par ab nahin he, magar camaron ke liye ab bhi vah ped zindaa he, jiske neeche khadey hokar reporter ab bhi news room ke aadesh par naatak kar rahe hai ki yahi vah ped he, jisaki ek tahani se gajendra latak gaya tha
 This is the tree that the leaders sitting on the platform kept watching
 ek din hamaare channel ped ko hi kasuurvaar tehra denge
 This is the tree that allowed Gazendra to hang
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gajendra kii jaan le lee
 Do not forget that we are living in the era of Peepli Live

 According to DCP Akhilesh Singh, the deceased was identified as Meenakshi Chaurasia
 usne apane pita kii marzi ke khilaaf isi saal farvari main apane premi brijesh chaurasia se shaadi kar lee thi
 Since then, Meenakshi's father, Rajkumar Chaurasia, was quite upset, although this caused Rajkumar to decide his daughter Meenakshi's relationship with two different boys
 lekin minakshi ne un donon rishton ko nakaar diya tha
 After this, she eloped with Brijesh and went to Satna in Madhya Pradesh and got married there
 police ke mutabik shaadi ke baad aaropee pita ke saath minakshi kii mulaakaat bhi ho hui thi
 Then his father said that never go to your village, otherwise it would be very insulting
 disipi akhilesh singh ke anusaar shanivaar kii shaam ko aaropee rajkumaar ne minakshi ko kapadon ke liye paise dene ke bahaane milane ke liye bulaayaa

 After carrying out the crime, the accused father escaped from there

 Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Congress MP from Madhya Pradesh's Guna, is considered close to party president Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ke nirdesh main sansad main congress kii ranneeti ko anjaam dena ho yaa madhya pradesh main congress ko dobaaraa majboot karne kii muhim, sindhiya bad-chadh kar aage dikhaai dete hai
 According to Scindia, Rahul Gandhi has been prepared as an alternative to Narendra Modi and he will be fully successful in winning the trust of the people of the country
 haalanki, madhya pradesh main congress kii ore se unhen khud mukhyamantri ke chehre ke taur par pesh kiye jane kii sambhaavna ko lekar sindhiya kehete hai ki party netritv jo bhi nirnay legaa, ek kaaryakarta ke naate wo unke sir-maathe hoga
 Scindia admitted without any hesitation that the Congress was going through a difficult period
 vanshavaad ke sawaal par sindhiya khud hi sawaal karte hai ki koun si party me vanshavaad nahin he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia gave straightforward answers to anchor Shweta Singh's straightforward questions, without any questions, in 'sidhi Baat', the flagship show of the country's No
1 news channel 'aaj Tak'
 is sawaal ke jabaav main ki kya ye congress kaa sabase kathin daur chal rahaa he, sindhiya ne kaha, "isamen koi do raay nahin, (agar) koi vyakti naa maane ki (congress kaa) kathin daur chal rahaa he or agar aisa kahata he to wo kisi or duniya main jeevanyaapan kar rahaa he
 "in response to the question whether the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections in 2018 are more important for him or the 2019 general elections, Jyotiraditya Scindia said," i believe that being a public servant and politician every election should be important for you
 mere liye chaahe loksabhaa chunaav ho yaa mere pradesh main kahin upachunaav ho, chaahe party mujhe jahaan bhi bhejti ho prachaar ke liye, har chunaav mahatv rakhata he
 "when Scindia was asked what would be the four issues that could become the charge sheet of the central government in 2019? He said, 'the central government's charge sheet will be made on many issues, not just four
 chaahe aantarik suraksha kaa maamla ho yaa desh ke andar kaa vaataavaran ho, chaahe videsh niti kii baat ho yaa doklam ho, pakistan kii baat ho yaa phir maldive kii, berogari kii baat ho yaa mahila suraksha kii, yaa phir data li or paper li ho, in sabakaa jabaav dena hoga
 "will 2018 elections determine the direction of 2019 elections? To this, he said, 'the most important milestone for me as a Congress party worker is currently the elections in Karnataka followed by the elections in four states
 ’2018 main madhya pradesh chunaav main jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa muqabla bijepi se he yaa phir congress kii andruni kalah se?, is par sindhiya ne kaha, 'congress main gutbaji kii raajnneeti jarur ek rielti thi lekin 5, 10, 15 saal pehle
 Now the top leadership of Congress in Madhya Pradesh, be it Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Suresh Pachauri, or Satyavrat Chaturvedi, we all decide together and decide the strategy ahead
 ‘jab unase ye sawaal kiya gaya ki saare survey kehete hai ki sindhiya bahut lokapriy cheharaa hai to unka naam congress kii ore se madhya pradesh main siem ke chehre ke taur par kyon ghoshit nahin kiya jaataa?, is sindhiya ne kaha, ‘netritv (pradesh main) kaa nirnay main maanata hum hai kaman legaa, congress party ke ek kaaryakarta ke rup main jo bhi nirnay liya jayega mere liye shirodharya he
 'whether Karti Chidambaram or Captain Amarinder Singh's son-in-law, whenever the matter of corruption, the Congress is surrounded by itself, Scindia said in response to this question,' Look at both of them where there is no issue raising the issue
 Huh
 amarinder singh ke damaad kaa mudda kya he, jo lone unhone liya tha wo enpie bhi ghoshit nahin hua tha
 We are ready, you take action, who is stopping you from taking action
 ’vanshavaad ke aaropon par puche gaye sawaalon parajyotiraditya sindhiyane kaha, "agar koi bijnes main kaa ladkaa yaa ladki ho us par aap kataaksh nahin karenge
 Doctor's boy or girl should become a doctor, but if a public servant's son or daughter comes to the field of public service then it is commented on
 desh kii koun si party main vanshavaad nahin he lekin ye sab log chunaav jitkar aate hai

 The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court will pronounce its verdict on September 24 on the civil claims regarding the ownership dispute of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid disputed site in Ayodhya
 pichhali 26 july ko nyaayamurti es
 U
 khan, nyaayamurti sudhir agarwal evam nyaayamurti dharmaveer sharma kii vishesh purna khand peeth ne chaaron divaani daavon par vistrut sunwaayee ke baad nirnay surakshit kar liya tha
 The first of these claims was filed in 1950, some 60 years ago
 varsh 1989 tak ke daawey pehle faijabad kii divaani adaalat main vichaaradhin rahe
 Subsequently, on the request of the then Advocate General, he was transferred to the High Court
 ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth main in daavon par sunwaayee chal rahi thi
 From 1995, testimony began in these claims
 janvari 2010 se inaki pratidin sunwaayee chal rahi thi
 The first claim was filed in 1950 by Gopal Singh Visharad, requesting permission to worship
 1959 main nirmohi akhaade ne daawa daayar kar ‘resiver‘ se prabhaar dilaane kaa aagrah kiya
 In 1961, the Sunni Central Waqf Board filed a declaratory suit urging the possession of the disputed site
 chauthaa daawa 1989 main bhagwaan shriram lalaa virajman ke naam se ‘next friend’ ke jariye daayar kiya gaya
 Sunni Central Waqf Board advocate Zafaryab Jilani said that the court took up the matter on September 24 at 3 pm
 30 baje faisla sunaaye jane ke liye soochibaddh karne ke aadesh diye hai
 After the lock in the disputed premises of ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid, the court ordered on 19 January 1950 on the petition filed by Gopal Singh Visharad of Ayodhya in a civil court that now the idols will not be removed from the place nor from the puja archana
 Somebody will be stopped
 iske baad babari masjid paksh ke logon ne 21 farvari 1950 ko adaalat main apil kii or maang kii, chunki san 1528 main babar ke senapati mir baaki ne is masjid ko banwaaya tha
 Therefore, it should be handed over to the Muslim community, against which Hindu organizations protested fiercely outside the court
 isi bich, tatkaaleen ram janm bhoomi nyaas ke adhyaksh ramachandra paramhans ne 5 disambar 1950 ko ramajanm bhoomi ko chhodane hetu ek yachika nyaayalay main daakhil kii, lekin yah yachika adaalat ke daav pench main hi funs kar rah gayi or dekhte dekhte lagbhag paanch varsh biit gayi
 On March 28, 1955, the parties of the Babri Masjid filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court, requesting the removal of the idol from the disputed premises and handing over the mosque to Muslims, while both Hindus and Muslims were offering prayers on their part
 disambar 1959 main ek nayaa mode aayaa jab nirmohi akhaade ke mahant rameshwar das ne resiver ko hataakar ramajanm bhoomi kii dekharekh apane haath main lene kii yachika daayar kar di
 On the other hand, the Sunni Central Waqf Board filed a suit in the court in 1961 to take possession of the mosque land, leading to controversy and confusion
 mandir or masjid samarthak vivaadit sthal ek duusare se mukt karaane ke liye ganit main lage rahe, lekin nateeja ‘dhak ke teen paat’ hi rahaa or dekhte hi dekhte teen dashak biit gayi
 The trial took a turn when on 1 February 1986 District Judge K
 em
 Pandey ordered the temple's lock to be opened on the petition of the temple's favor Umesh Chandra Pandey
 us samay pradesh main congress or kendra main rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar thi, jo masjid ke samarthakon ko acha nahin laga or jila nyaayalay ke is faisle ke khilaaf sabase pehle ayodhya nivasee mohammad hashim ne elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main apil daayar kii
 Subsequently, in May 1986, the Sunni Waqf Board also filed a petition against the lock opening in the High Court
 haalanki, ucch nyaayalay ne jila nyaayalay ke aadesh ko barkaraar rakhaa, tab se puja lagaataar ho rahi he
 On 6 December 1992, a new era began after the disputed structure was demolished by Kar Sevaks during Karseva

 The political economy of the Republican Party and the ruling Democratic Party could derail the world's largest economy

 Longest shutdown: lasted 21 days

 iske alaava jaish-e-mohammad ke 22 pakistani aatanki or 19 sthaneey aatanki kashmir main aaj bhi sakriy hai
 Sources have claimed that at this time Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI is not relying on Hizbul Mujahideen's foreign and local militants for the operation
 haalanki hijbul ke sthaneey aatankiyon kii sankhya kashmir main 102 he jo sabase zyada he
 Indian security agencies are constantly questioning how to eliminate these terrorists
 haalanki is saal surakshabalon ne kashmir ghati main ab tak 30 se zyada aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar diya he
 The security forces are worried that the terrorists are taking training from the ISI and the Pakistan Army to move away from the old trend of carrying out suicide attacks and suicide attacks

 Sources have claimed that the training camp where Pakistan is training Jaish terrorists used to be used by Pakistan Army earlier
 ab pakistan kii sena ne yah camp jaish- e-mohammad ke aatankwaadiyon ko training ke liye de diya he
 On the other hand, security agencies have also informed that Hashiz Saeed, the mastermind of Lashkar, is also training the terrorists in a big way in Pakistan's "boi" training camp

 To reduce the congestion in the local trains of Mumbai, the Union Railway Minister has suggested a unique way
 railmantri suresh prabhu ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis se mumbai main mulaaqaat kar kaha ki, shahar ke daphtaron kaa samay badla jaae
 God wants to see this change happening in the time of private and government offices

 Local service runs on the three routes, Central, West, and Harbor in Mumbai

 The time from 8 am to 11 am and 6 pm to 9 pm is the most crowded time
 tab daphtaron main jane or lautne kii bheed local train se chalati he
 Due to this, there is no place for the passengers to breathe in the local called Mumbai's Lifeline
 railmantri ke suzav ke tahat mumbai ko teen alag-alag time zone main baantnaa hoga
 In which there will be three such time zones as South, Central and North
 har time zone duusare se 2 ghante deree se shuru hoga
 Due to which the rush of staff going to the office will not use the rail service in the city at the same time
 rail vibhaag or maharashtra sarkaar ke bich samanvay badhaane ke liye railmantri prabhu mumbai ke daure par hai
 Under this, he met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and made several suggestions

 There have been 3 major incidents of theft in the Brahmaputra Enclave of Siddharth Vihar in Ghaziabad in the last 5 days, but the criminals are still far from the reach of Ghaziabad Police

 sheersh str ke adhikariyon se baat karne par chaanbin kii baat kahi ja rahi he, lekin abhi kuch bhi hasil nahin hua he
 Then on 4 February, the thieves took away goods worth thousands of rupees by cutting an iron latch in each flat of blocks number 15 and 16 of Brahmaputra Enclave
 isse pehle 31 janvari ko block number 54 main subah 11 baje se pehle chori kii aisi hi ek ghatana ghati jab surendra kumaar or unki patni apane bete ke skool main pitim main bhaag lene gaye the

 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav, called the desperate king of Bihar's politics, is in jail due to conviction, but is currently admitted to RIMS Hospital in Ranchi for treatment
 iske chalate lalu yadav bihar kii chunavi mahaasangram main na to utrenge or nahin unki aawaaj sunai sunai degi
 This will be the first time in the political of the last four decades when Bihar will have an electoral battle without Lalu Yadav
 aise main unke kunbe main bhi mahabharat chhidi hui he or khud ko krishna-arjuna bataane vaale donon bete aamane-saamne hai
 In such a situation, RJD has to face challenges both inside and outside
 1970 ke dashak main lalu yadav apana siyaasi safar jiro se shuru kiya or sadak se sansad tak sangharsh kar bihar ke daliton-pichhadon or vanchiton kii aawaaj ban gaye
 After 15 years in power in Bihar, Lalu suffered a major setback in the 2005 state assembly elections
 lekin modi ke centre main raajnneetik udai hone ke baad lalu apane puraane tevar main najar aae
 Lalu gave the victory formula to the desperate opposition in 2014
 bihar main lalu ne nitish ke saath milakar mahagathbandhan kaa nirmaan kiya
 In Bihar, this political equation prevailed over modi-shah and it rained votes in favor of Mahabandhan
 isse bijepi kii jeet kaa silsilaa hi nahin thama balki vipaksh main ek ummid jaagi ki narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 Lalu once again expressed that he has no involvement in political betting
 bihar kii siyasat ke 40 saal main pehali baar he ki lalu prasad yadav chunavi ranbhumi main najar nahin aa rahe hai
 rjd's reins in Lalu's absence are handled by his son and former Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav
 lekin unke liye sabase bada sirdard unke bade bhai tej pratap bane hue hai
 RJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha said while talking to Aaj Tak, 'without Laluji, it cannot be conceived of elections not only in Bihar but in North India
 sach he ki argedy ke liye unki anupasthiti myne rakhti he, lekin unki anupasthiti kin vajahon, kin logon or kin sajishon se he, yah cheez zyada mahatv rakhti he
 In such a situation, during the elections, people want to see their leader among themselves, but this has not happened
 sattapaksh kii ore se puri koshish kii gai ki laluji chunaav main maujuud na rahen
 The people of Bihar have made up their mind to give a befitting reply
 'bihar kii raajnneeti ko kareeb se dekhne vaale varisht patrkaar himanshu mishra kehete hai ki lalu yadav bhale hi jail main hon, lekin myth ke taur par abhi bhi bihar kii siyasat main maujuud hai
 While in jail, Lalu managed coalitions and seat-sharing by combining parties
 isse saaf he ki lalu apni anupasthiti main bhi damdaar upasthiti darj karaane main kaamyaab rahe
 That is why Lalu's room was searched
 unhone kaha ki lalu ke jail main rahane se bas yahi galat sandesh ja rahaa he ki parivaar nahin sanbhal rahaa he
 Both sons are face to face for political legacy
 aise main agar lalu baahar hote to parivaar main is tarah se kalah saamne na aati
 Apart from this, the alliance that could not be reached with the CPI would have been resolved
 jail main rahete hue is myne main nuksaan rahaa he
 Apart from this, the class which has sympathy from being in jail has always been with them
 modi lahar ke baavjood argedy kaa 20 fisadi se zyada vot rahaa he, aise main lalu ke jail main rahane se argedy ke yadav or muslim main voting pratishat main badhottaree ho sakati he
 Political analyst Aligarh Muslim professor Mohammad Sajjad says that Lalu Yadav should remain in the field or not, but his opinion is coming before the people
 lalu ke jail main rahane kaa argedy ko raajnneetik phayda milegaa, kyonki unke log maan rahe hai ki lalu ko aprklas or bijepi ne ek sajeesh ke tahat jail main daal rakhaa he
 While other scam accused are roaming outside
 argedy ke log lalu yadav ke ek peedit ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 However, due to Lalu's absence from the election field, his speech and unique style will not be seen
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad lalu yadav hi aise eklaute netaa the, jinhone narendra modi or amit shah ke vijay rath par brake lagane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Lalu Yadav forgetting his enmity with Nitish Kumar and joined hands to form a new political equation
 iskaa nateeja tha ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main modi-shah kii jodi ko bihar main karaari maat khaani padi
 However, this association of RJD-JDU could not last for many days
 2018 main nitish ne lalu kaa saath chhodkar bijepi ke saath dobaaraa gathbandhan kar sarkaar bana lee
 JDU has fielded with BJP and LJP in Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin, lalu yadav kii raajnneetik viraasat sambhaal rahe tejasvi yadav ne congress samet kai dalon ke saath mahagathbandhan banaaya he
 In this, RJD, Congress, Hindustana Awam Morcha, RLSP and VIP Party have formed a coalition

 The first thing is that the new generation creators in Hindi have started making their presence known
 unamendivya prakaash doobese lekarnikhil sachantak aurasatya vyasase lekarjit bharatitak hai
 The same generation has also left the Shigufa of New Hindi
 par abhi to yah paribhaashit nahin ho paaya he ki nai hindi kya he? baharhaal, dark horse neelotpal mrinal kii pehali kriti or pehla upanyaas he
 In this novel you will see the same stream that appeared in the novels like Joop 65, Banaras Talkiesyamasafir Kafeje
 asal main chetan bhagat kii lokapriyata ne hindi main nae rachanakaaron kii ek paudh shuru kii he or neelotpal mrinal srujanashiltaa kii bechaini ko kaagaj par udelte dikhte hai
 This generation is feeling sorry that Hindi is no longer the property of the mandarins and hence people are writing and printing Manmarji without taking care of critics
 yah sahitya ke loktantrikaran kaa daur he
 In his role, Mrinal writes that he has not written any literature in the form of a novel
 acha! kya yah aalochakon kii najar se bachane ke liye diya gaya bayaan he yaa ek vinamr daawa? baharhaal, is kriti ko sahitya academy yuva puraskaar mil chukaa he
 In this context, it can be said that the author must have considered this work to be truly literature and also nominated him for this award
 to bhoomika or puraskaar milakar ek sambhram kii sthiti he
 Why, if this novel, after all, is not literature, he should have refused to take the award
 is upanyaas ko style yaa kathy ke lihaaj se parkhaa nahin ja saktaa
 While reading several times, you will see a glimpse of half a dozen Banaras-centric novels of the current section, in the dialogues, one will see the novel Roy Baatka, Gandy Akka
 par agar aapane yaa aapke parivaar main kisi ne kabhi patna, elahabaad, dilli ke north yaa south campus main vijaynagar, mukherjee nagar or katwaria sarai main kabhi civil seva kii taiyaari kii hogi, to yah upanyaas ek dfa aapako jarur padhanaa chahie
 95 percent of the pages of the novel tell of the failures of the candidates
 or nayak ke, yani dark horse kii lantraniyon kaa bhi
 However, after dealing with his struggle in one and a half paragraphs, Mrinal declared her successful
 yahaan shailigat jerk dikhaai detaa he
 However, Mrinal has captured the mentality and psychology of the civil service candidates
 upanyaas main ek samvaad he, ‘jetana din main log eme-piechdi karegaa, haunk ke pard diya to otna din main to aiese ban jayega
 Understand this dialogue captures the psychology of the candidates, who are engaged in the preparation from year to year
 dark horse main abhyarthiyon ke oonche or khubasurat khwab hai, jimmedaariyon kaa zikr he
 Is shrugged parivaar or gaanv main apni izzatfajai or agali kai pidiyon kaa uddhaar kar dene kaa utsaah he
 Mrinal, portraying Mukherjee Nagar, presents an honest picture
 maano aap ek khidki par baithkar saare kirdaaron or drishyon ko saamne saakaar hote dekh rahe hon
 But at the same time, it also has a filmy and Bollywood theatricality
 usee naatakeeyata main gaanv se aae chachaa bhi hai, jo dilli dikhaane kii jid karte hai
 There is poverty in the same, there is also sold land in the village
 kai dfa ho jane vaala navayuvakeey prem bhi he
 But the novel lacks that tense climax that makes a work better
 agar aapane haal-philhal ke hindi upanyaason ko uchatati nigaah se bhi padhaa ho to aapako nae kism ke kirdaar bamushkil hi milenge
 You will only see characters from Banaras-centric novels, just like the back set in the theater has been changed
 canvas badal gaya he kirdaar bas alag kapadon main najar aate hai
 Maybe this is the truth of our era
 vaise, mrinal kii tarif is baat main he ki unhone apane kirdaaron ko collar pakad kar nahin chalaaya he
 His characters speak whenever they want
 shaayad isliye mrinal apni rachana ko sahitya ke darje main nahin rakhte
 However, things like purity in literature are meaningless (goki literature is a mirror of society), but variation in characters, diversity in ascension in their emotional journey can be expected
 kul milakar upanyaas pathneey to he, bikaoo bhi
 But in terms of the narrative is average
 mrinal sambhaavnaaen jagaane vaale lekhak hai, isliye dilachasp hoga ki vah agali dfa kisi kahani lekar aate hai

 jab haryana main bijepi sarkaar kisaanon ko paisa de sakati he to upi sarkaar kyon nahin, hamaari sarkaar banegi to 14 dinon main kisaanon ko paisa mil jayega
 Farmers produce paddy and wheat, but why does the UP government not buy at a fixed price

 The BJP government purchases 70% of the goods at a fair price

 soshal media par jhansa dekar ladakiyon ko blackmel karne kii khabaren to aapane bahut dekhi or suni hongi
 But a man in Delhi used to trap women in his web by creating his profile on matrimonial sites
 vah shaadi kaa jhansa dekar mahilaon ke saath shaareerik sambandh banaata tha
 And later he blackmailed them and extorted money
 police ne aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The case is of North West district of Delhi
 jahaan ashok vihaar thana police ne 36 varshiya manish gupta naamak shaks ko giraftaar kiya he
 Manish, who describes himself as an iron businessman, used to get money from women by entrapping them in his web

 In fact, this vicious fraudster lives in Rohini area of delhi with his wife and two children
 isane thagi karne kaa nayaa tarika nikaala or lagbhag aadha darjan metrimonial cites par khud ko register kar liya
 With the help of this man, many high-profile women were made his prey
 kai mahilaon ke saath shaadi kaa vaada karke shaareerik sambandh banaae
 Meanwhile, a lady doctor from Ashok Vihar lodged a complaint against Manish Gupta with the police
 mahila doctor ne police ko bataaya ki manish ab tak usase 75 hajaar rupee thag chukaa he
 Police got into action on the complaint of the woman
 manish ko uske ghar se hiraasat main le liya gaya
 The police started questioning Manish

 Police came to know that Manish, besides the female doctor, made many women victims
 wo site par mahilaon ko shaadi jhansa dekar unki asmat se khilwaad karata tha
 Describing herself as divorced, she used to make divorced women a soft target

 Women facing divorce and loneliness were caught in her trap

 Who had become the victim of Manish Gupta
 manish ne in mahilaon se teen lakh rupee kii thagi kii thi
 Police have found the numbers of 30 women from Manish's mobile
 wo sabhi ke sampark main tha
 This means that by now this person must have made dozens of women victims of their forgery and lust
 police manish se poochtacha kar rahi he
 This disclosure has made it clear that there is a great need to be careful in making contact with anyone on social sites
 unhone kaha, ‘‘raavi nadi ke us paar bahut bada ilaaka failaa hua he or vahaan jamaa hone vaala barish kaa pani nadiyon ke jariye pakistan pahunch jaataa he

 Both these collisions are said to be gang members
 police ke mutabik lutpaat karne or jeb saaf karne ke liye ye jaanboojhkar raah chalate logon ko dhakka dete hai
 By the time the front man is able to understand and understand something, he has cleaned his valuables and pockets
 jab tak luutane vaale ko pataa chalata he, tab tak yebadmashuski pahunch se dur nikal chuke hote hai
 Their targets are people who exit cash from the bank, people who exit atms and people who go out to shop in the markets
 kai bade bazaaron main ye jewelery kii dukaanon ke aasapaas khadey rahete or shikaar kii taak main rahete hai

 prasannataa paane kii ichha sabake man main rahati he
 The Declaration of Independence in America said that every person has the right to happiness and freedom
 har dharm va darshan prasannataa tak pahunchane kaa maarg dikhaata he
 i am not talking about any one religion, but if you are happy by following the rules of any religion, then you must follow it
 koi chaahe kuch bhi kahe, asli prasannataa aapke uddeshy main chhipi he
 These objectives affect your whole life
 agar aapane jivan ke vibhinn kshetron ke liye lakshya nahin banaae hai to aapako is disha main sochna chahie
 Happiness depends on external conditions and how to deal with them
 vishesh lakshyon kii ore badhane se prasannataa kaa str bhi badhata he
 We should be clear about our goals
 lakshya banaae bina to ek kadam bhi chalanaa kathin hota he
 Then you should set a time limit for accomplishing those goals
 phir yojana par kaam shuru kar den or jahaan aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan badlaav laaen
 As you move towards the goal, the happiness will increase
 aapane note kiya hoga ki jab log koi pariksha paas karke agali kaksha main jate hai yaa civil sarvice kii pariksha dekar sarvice main aate hai to unki khushi kaa koi thikaana nahin hota
 i still remember how proud and happy i was when i was selected for the IPS on May 27, 1961
 lakshya tak pahunch na paanaa, ishya, udaasi, thakaan, akelaapan, sambandhon kii pareshaaniyaan tathaa dusron kii najar main bura banane kaa bhay aadi prasannataa kii raah main baadha ban jate hai
 To get happiness it is necessary to have good health, fixed goals, healthy relationships, adequate earning, family affection, productive work and positive attitude
 meri raay main acchhee sehat kaa matlab he ki sharir main koi rog na ho
 This brings excitement in life and doubles the fun of living
 acchhee sehat kaa matlab yah nahin hota ki aapaki sehat kisi olympic khilaadi kii tarah badhiya ho jaae
 Small problems like cough, cold or fever etc
 do not mean that we are not healthy
 ye asthaayee pareshaaniyaan apane aap hal ho jaati hai
 Without good health, we can neither get anything in life nor earn a livelihood
 ek sakaaratmak ravaiya, ghatnaon va halaat ke prati sahaj bhav or logon ke bare main acchhee raay hamaari prasannataa ko najadik le aate hai
 We should also give up the habit of being discouraged
 ye tathy aapaki prasannataa ke str ko ooncha kar sakate hai :1
 Curiosity, impulse, passion 2
 pasandida kaam 3
 Impersonal Access 4
 kadi mehnat prasann rahane kaa chunaav har vyakti swayan hi karata he

 The BJP created history by riding on the Modi wave in this Lok Sabha election
 30 baras baad kisi party ko purna bahumat hasil hua

 uske baad se kabhi kisi dal ko purna bahumat nahin mila or desh main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 This was a matter of party level, but Narendra Modi, who is going to become the 14th Prime Minister of the country, created many records on a personal level as well
 modi duusare aise maatr siem hai jo mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue sidhe pradhanmantri pad tak pahunch gaye
 HD Deve Gowda has done this feat before
 vah 11 disambar 1994 se 31 may 1996 tak karnataka ke mukhyamantri rahe or phir 1 june 1996 se 21 april 1997 tak desh ke pradhanmantri rahe
 Apart from this, Modi is the sixth Chief Minister of the country who is going to become the PM
 isse pehle choudhary charan singh, vishwanath pratap singh, morarji desai, echdi devgauda or pi ve narsingh raav ko hi yah gaurav hasil he

 According to the study from 2008 to 2016, it is now slipping backwards by 11 meters every year, whereas in 1974 it slipped backward on average by 35 meters per year
 ek anya adhyayan ke mutabik 1817 se ab tak ye glacier teen kilometre peeche khisak chukaa he

 96% of the glacier ice is in Antarctica followed by Greenland in the Arctic with 12%
 iske baad sabase zyaada glacier himalay main hai jise isi vajah dharti kaa teesraa dhruv kaha jaataa he
 Gangotri is one of the largest glaciers from which the water released quenches the thirst of North India's population of 500 million
 lekin beeti ek do sadi is glacier par baari beeti hai, ye lagaataar peeche khisakta ja rahaa he
 However, recent scientific surveys are showing that the speed of slipping behind this glacier has decreased
 2008 se 2016 tak ke adhyayan ke mutabik ab ye har saal 11 meter peeche khisak rahaa he jabaki 1974 main iske peeche khisakane kii dar ausatan 35 meter prativarsh thi
 According to another study, since 1817, this glacier has slipped backward by three kilometers

 research kaa kahana he ki bahut saare jeev jantu jo saamaanya taur par yahaan vahaan dikh jate hai wo bhi ab vilupt hone kii kagaar par hai
 Professor Gerardo ceballos has said that the situation is so frightening that it would be worse if harsh words were not used

 It took millions of years before the fauna disappeared from the earth, but now within a few years many animals are becoming extinct
