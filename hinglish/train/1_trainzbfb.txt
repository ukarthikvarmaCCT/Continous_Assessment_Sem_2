 Is only milk of a particular breed of cow used during the worship of Lord Venkateswara in Tirupati temple? Some people are making such claims on social media
 alag-alag gaayon kaa video aplod karke daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki video ek khaas nasl kii gaay punganur kaa he or isi gaay kaa doodh, bhagwaan tirupati ke abhishek main istemaal hota he
 Facebook user Anita Gupta uploaded a video of a brown cow roaming in the midst of lush green grass and wrote, 'the cost of this cow is 12 crores and it gives about 100 liters of milk per day
 yah punganur gaay he
 It is only with the cow's milk that the Tirupati Lord is anointed
 ise dekhnaa bahut hi shubh mana gaya he
 # Share as much as possible so that you can also see
 'is post par logon ne haath jod kar pranaam kiya he
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 isi tarah se kuch aurfesbucuzar jaise namo Gunjan ne bhi yahi daawa karte hue ek alag video aplod kiya
 In this video, a white cow is being decorated and worshiped
 is post kaa archived varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being made with the viral post is misleading
 tirupati temple trust ke paas ek bada farm he jahaan hazaron alag-alag nasl kii gaayon kaa rakh rakhaav hota he
 The milk of all cows is used in any work of the temple
 thirumala tirupatu devsthanamek deyari farm bhi sanchalit karata he
 Director of this farm, Harnath Reddy said that there are more than 3000 cows that are maintained here
 reddy ne kaha, 'hamaare yah zyaadaatar ongole, gir or sahiwal gaay hai
 The milk of all these cows is used in all works of the trust
 mandir main abhishek ke liye bhi sabhi gaayon ke doodh kaa istemaal hota he
 We also have Pungnoor cow
 lekin is nasl kii gaay ab bahut kam rah gai he isliye inhen bachaane kaa kaam hamaare yahaan ho rahaa he
 This cow only gives a few liters of milk, but our aim is to save and serve them
 'hamane ne reddy ko viral video ke link bheje to unhone bataaya ki donon main se koi bhi gaay punganur nahin he
 Reddy said, 'the white cow is the Ongole and the brown cow is the Gir cow of Gujarat
 ' punganur gaay naati hoti he jisaki ginati duniya main sabase chote gaayon main hoti he
 In the investigation, we found some reports on the Internet, according to which several steps are being taken to save the cow of the Pungnur breed
 haalanki is report main likhaa gaya he ki khaas taur se sirf isi gaay ke doodh se ghi kaa bhagwaan venkatesh ke abhishek ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin mandir se jude logon ne iskaa puri tarah khandan kiya he
 Ravi, public relations officer of the temple, said, 'the milk of all the cows on the farm is mixed and used in all the works of the trust
 aisa kuch nahin he ki sirf ek khaas gaay kii nasl kaa hi doodh istemaal hota he kisi ek khaas kaam ke liye
 So the cow seen in the viral video is not Pungnoor
 iske alaava bhagwaan venkatesh kii murti ke abhishek ke liye sirf punganur gaay kaa doodh hi istemaal hota he, ye daawa bhi galat he

 com / x2bzdwq1wo There are more than 7172 railway stations in the country
 auraun se roj guzarati hai 12617 trainen
 Thursday is a special day for the 13 lakh 10 thousand employees handling these trains and about 20 million passengers traveling on them every day
 nae relbajet se bahut si ummiden jo hai
 There are also speculations about something different from the budget
 pipipi or epadiai laane kaa rasta saaf kiye jane kii ummid he
 Know the ten things that should be in the railway budget -01
 saaf-safitrenon main yatra karte samay sabase zyada gussa gande toilet or coach dekhakar aata he
 The budget should increase the allocation of funds for railway cleaning
 saath hi train main bio-toilet (jinamein pani kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti) or sisitivi camera lagaae jaaen to halaat behatar ho sakate hai
 02
 urja sangrakshanpichhali bajet main railmantri ne train ke upar solar panel lagaae jane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 If this is done, the fuel of the trains will also be saved
 or railway ko aarthik rup se laabh bhi hoga
 PM Modi has also advocated this
 03
 Foreign investors should be given an opportunity to maintain foreign investment stations, train maintenance and running long distance trains
 isse yatriyon ko suvidha bhi hogi or railway ko phayda bhi
 04
 bullate trainrelmantri ne pichley bajet main is train ko chalaane kaa elaan to shaan se kiya tha
 But there was no significant progress at the ground level
 ek trial ke baad maamla thande baste main chalaa gaya
 Bullet train scheme deadline and budget should be fixed in this budget
 05
 For the proposed railway university in Railway University, neither the site has been selected yet nor has any decision been taken regarding its educational and governmental structure
 is bajet main rail mantri suresh prabhu ko is bare main dhan kaa praavdhaan kar kaam aage badhanaa chahie
 06
 chardhaam yatrapichley rail bajet main pradhanmantri modi ne chaar dham kii yatra ko rail maarg se jodne kaa elaan kiya tha
 There was also talk of starting a survey for him
 lekin kedarnath, badrinaath, yamunotri or gangotri tak rail network banane ke liye koi pukhta karrwai abhi tak nahin hui he
 In this budget, the Railway Minister should try to make this journey smooth
 07
 Recruitment to vacant posts: In the last railway budget, the government had talked about recruitment to vacant posts
 saath hi railway suraksha bal (arpeef) main 17 hajaar javaanon ke saath hi chaar hajaar atirikt mahila surakshakarmiyon kii bhartee kaa elaan kiya tha
 But according to the announcement, no special work was done
 is bajet main khaali pade padon ko bharne kii jarurat he
 This will also provide work to many unemployed
 08
 Station on the lines of the airport In the previous budget, the then Railway Minister Gowda had announced to develop ten big stations in the country on the lines of the airport
 lekin us pariyojna par kuch khaas kaam nahin hua
 In this budget it can be expected that Rambambhi Prabhu will implement this scheme
 09
 Anti-collision system: The anti-collision system developed in the country was introduced from Konkan
 lekin uttar bharat samet kai sthanon par is pranali kaa istemaal kiye jane kii ghoshnaa ke baavjood kaam shuru nahin hua
 The Railway Minister should focus on this important scheme
 yah pranali rail durghatnaon ko rokane main kargar he
 10
 aarakshan vyavastha main sudharhar rail bajet se yatriyon ko ummid rahati he ki sarkaar aarakshan pranali ko aasaan or paardarshee banaaegi
 But despite the announcements, there is neither freedom from the web of brokers nor from long queues and waiting lists
 is bajet main railmantri se janata ko ummid he ki ve aarakshan niti ko behatar banane ke liye thos kadam uthaaenge
 Former Chief Minister of Goa and Union Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar made a big mess at the inauguration ceremony of the 45th International Indian Film Festival in Goa
 parrikar darasal, uddhatan samaaroh main maujuud ganmaanya vyaktiyon kaa naam lekar unki upasthiti par aabhaar vyakt kar rahe the
 In this, he forgot to name the South's superstarrajnikantaka
 parrikar ne uddhatan samaaroh main soochna evam prasaaran mantri arun jetali, soochna evam prasaaran rajya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod, goa ke mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar or rajya kii rajyapal mridula sinha kaa naam lekar aabhaar vyakt kiya lekin vah rajnikant kaa naam lenaa bhul gaye
 Parrikar, however, immediately admitted his mistake with a smile
 ek sharmili muskaan ke saath rajnikant ko sambodhit karte hue parrikar ne kaha, 'gadabadi ke liye maafee chahta hum
 i wrote the names (of the dignitaries present at the ceremony), but i forgot that paper below
 'parde par apni gussell swabhaav ke liye vikhyatarajnikantane pratiuttar main garmjoshi se muskuraate hue maahaul ko phir khushnuma bana diya
 - Input IANS mahaj 45 dinon main chaar baaghon kii maut se madhya pradesh ke liye desh main ''tiger state" kaa darja dobaaraa hasil karne kaa prayaas khatai main pad saktaa he
 The number of tigers dying in 2017 has reached 25, with fresh deaths due to unnatural causes, which is certainly a matter of concern
 inamen se 15 baaghon kii maut bandhavgarh neshnal park ke jangalon or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main hui
 The latest incident is dated December 11 in which an adult tigress was found dead near Kachodar in Umaria district
 ek din baad uskaa ek shaavak mila or vah bhi shikariyon ke bichhaae hue jaal main curent lagane se mara tha
 The meeting of the two dead bodies three days after the death points to the careless attitude of the concerned authorities — the wildlife officials responsible for keeping a watch on the tigers in Bandhavgarh were not even aware of these deaths
 november main bhi isi tarah do ghatnaayen hui thim jinamein shadol ke paas jehar die jane se ek baagh mara hua paaya gaya tha, jabaki umariya jile ke dhorai main ek anya baagh curent lagane se mara paaya gaya tha
 The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which came into action on a sudden rise in the "unnatural" deaths of tigers, has sent a notice to the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department seeking its response
 haalanki rajya ke afasaron ne abhi tak koi jawaab nahin diya he lekin isse rajya main aarope-pratyarope kaa janaa-pahachaanaa khel shuru ho gaya he
 a senior forest officer, on the condition of anonymity, says that Standard Operating Procedures (sops) are not being adopted
 ve kehete hai, ''ek baar pataa chal jaae ki ilaake main koi baagh he to bijli ke taron ke fande kaa pataa lagane ke liye gasht badha di jaani chahie, khaskar un ilaakon main jo is tarah ke aparaadhon ke liye badnaam hai
 “according to him, there is no system to make the local people aware of this as there is a shortage of trained wildlife officials
 unhone kaha, ''ve yaa to mukhyalay par yaa van vibhaag se baahar niyukt hote hai
 "wildlife activist Ajay Dubey also points to a shortage of staff as lower level workers are engaged in VIP duty in tiger reserves
 dube van adhikariyon ke is jawaab ko khaarij karte hai ki fande baaghon ko fansaane ke liye nahin lagaae gaye the
 They say, "is this any answer?" Just a local person is arrested, who is always a tribal
 lekin is tarah kii ghatnaon main koi kami nahin aati
 "by the year 2006, Madhya Pradesh had 300 tigers, which was the highest number of any state in the country
 lekin baaghon kii mauton main ijapha hote jane se isane apana sthaan ganvaa diya
 It was replaced by Karnataka and Uttarakhand
 baaghon kii sankhya dobaaraa badhaane kaa abhiyaan shuru karte hue madhya pradesh 2018 main hone vaali rashtriya vanyajeev gananaa ke baad dobaaraa apni haisiyat hasil karnaa chahta tha
 But for him to stop poaching should be the first step
 dhavnyajeev kaaryakarta ajay dube staff kii kami kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Lower level employees are engaged in VIP duty in tiger reserves

 When asked whether the Congress does not repeatedly raise the old issues, the Congress spokesperson said that we do not raise such issues

 com / rva0p95wea The relationship between Indian hockey and coach Terry Walsh will be such that no one has thought of it before
 bhartiya hockey coach terry walsh ne khel mantralay jaakar media ke saamne khel mantri se haath bhi milaae, lekin in sabake dil bhi mil gaye hon, ye to katai nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Even after meeting the Sports Minister, whether or not Walsh will continue to be the coach of the team is not known to the coach himself
 coach walsh ne kaha ki bhartiya hockey kaa coach bananaa unke liye sabase mushkil kaamon main se ek he
 He said that he wants to work with Indian hockey, but according to him, his terms will be considered in the new agreement, only then he will be able to work with this team
 vahiin khelmantri sarbanand sonoval ne kaha ki bhartiya hockey ko coach walsh kii zarurat he, kyonki walsh ke saath bhartiya team ne badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 But Walsh has many conditions, one of which is that he wants to stay in Perth and also coach the Indian team
 unhone pichley pradarshan ke aadhaar par apni tankhwaah main badhotaree kii maang bhi kii he
 But Hockey India President Narendra Batra questioned the character of Walsh, citing the agreement between Terry Walsh and American Hockey over the software
 walsh ne hairaan or dukhi hokar pratikriya di ki isse kisi kaa faaydaa nahin hone vaala he or is bare main aage media main baat karne se manaa kar diya
 In recent times, Asiad, Commonwealth Games and Indian Hockey in Australia have achieved many great successes
 bhartiya hockey kii ye jeet kii tasviren jaldi hi fans ke zehan se mit jaaen, iske liye adhikari maidan ke baahar acha khel rahe hai
 From the 6th of next month, the Indian team will take part in the Champions Trophy, Hockey's toughest tournament
 is toornament main bhartiya team ab tak sirf ek baar podium par jagah banane main kaamyaab hui he
 But after the recent success, the team's vice-captain PR Sreejesh says that the players' confidence has increased after the win in Australia and they hope that the team will perform well in this tournament as well
 bhartiya hockey team ke golkeeper upakptain kehete hai ki haal kii kamyaabi se bhartiya team ke hausale buland hai
 he said that vah to champiens trophy ko haath main uthaane kaa sapana dekhte hai
 They are confident that the team will get the benefit of playing matches in the home ground this time and this time the team will perform well
 darasal asian khelon ke baad hockey coach terry walsh kii tex kii adaayagi ko lekar masalaa pehle hockey india ne hi uthaaya tha
 Hockey coach Walsh then offered his resignation and there was a lot of ruckus in the media
 terry walsh ne is maukey kaa faaydaa uthaate hue apni tankhwaah or hockey ke saport staff or kaamkaaj ke kai mudde ek saath uthaa die
 Many of these issues continue to exist
 is masale ko sulajhane ke liye purv captain ajit paal singh, zafar ikbaal or ashok kumaar jaise diggajon kii cameti Was formed, but after long meetings, this committee failed to resolve the issue
 hockey kii ye kahani nai nahin he
 Whenever the Indian team achieves great success, the officials do not allow this success to become big outside the field
 ek baar phir bhartiya hockey usee mukaam par khadi he
 Obviously the hockey game is happening so fast outside the field that it is difficult to understand on which side the goalpost is
 filhal itnaa zarur kaha ja saktaa he ki champiens trophy main gol bachaane ke liye hockey team ko ko had se zyada mehnat kerani hogi
 If you are unmarried, you may have many reasons for not daring to get married
 inamen se he depressant main jane kaa dar
 a recent study has shown that the stress of marital life can easily push people towards depression

 There is speculation of Patel leader youth leader Hardik Patel going to NCP in Gujarat
 ensipi netaa prafull patel aaj hardik se milane pahunche the
 However, Hardik says that after Diwali, Gujaratis have a new year
 yah mulaakaat bas nae saal ke liye shubhakamanaayen dene ke liye thi
 It has nothing to do with the election
 chunavi maahaul main mulaakaat ke khaas mynehardik patel bhale hi is mulaakaat ko chunavi chashme se nahin dekhne ke liye kah rahe hai, lekin jis vakt main yah mulaakaat ho rahi he, us vajah se yah kai myne main khaas he
 Elections in Gujarat are extremely important for Hardik Patel, who emerged as the young leader of the Patidar Samaj two years ago
 7 november tak congress ko diya he ultimatumkuch dinon pehle tak lag rahaa tha ki hardik congress kaa haath tham lenge, lekin ain vakt par unhonecongress ko ultimatumde diya
 He granted the Congress first till November 3 in the matter of giving quota to the Patidar society
 baad main unhone kaha ki ve 7 november tak intjaar karenge
 The Congress has so far kept silence on this
 isse mana ja rahaa ki unhone khud pair par kulhadi maar lee he
 After the Congress pulled out, Hardik did not have much choice in the election
 darasal is ultimatum ne unki congress se duuri badha di he
 Hardik did not show up in the survey, just before the election in Gujarat, India Today Group and AXIS MY INDIA did a survey together
 survey main logon kii raay thi ki congress ko hardik patel kaa saath milane par bhi koi phayda nahin milane vaala
 This will neither increase their vote share nor benefit the seat
 hardik ke akele chunaav ladane par 182 siton vaali vidhansabha main unka khaataa bhi khulata nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Hardikasal, who emerged suddenly from the rallies in 2015, Hardik Patel, who emerged as a big youth leader by joining the youth of Patidar community in 2015, has made a significant intervention in the politics of Gujarat in the last two years
 2015 main hui hardik kii raily ne kai netaaon kii neend uda di thi
 Big leaders were blown away
 Sleephardik Patel held several big rallies in Gujarat in 2015
 in reliyon se soobe kii sarkaar tak dabaav main aa gai thi
 It is also difficult to form a new party, if Rahul Gandhi did not promise to provide reservation to the Patidar community, it could be the most difficult for Hardik Patel
 hardik patel ke bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke dur-dur tak asaar nahin hai
 If Rahul does not respond to Hardik's ultimatum, then he has no choice but to go for the Third Front
 ab gujarat chunaav main bahut vakt nahin bachaa he, aise main hardik nai party bhi nahin bana sakate
 Now if Hardik distances himself from the election, his existence as a Patidar leader will also be questioned

 *** Kala and Lakshmi have always had a sinful relationship
 film kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye baari-bharkam bajet or media ke dheron plateform ko dekhte hue yah tanaav or bhi bad gaya he
 As a filmmaker and entertainer in my day, i have realized that marketing of the film has become an integral part of this entire process
 iske liye paryaapt bajet hona jaruri he, ek media yojana taiyaar kerani padati he ki kis tarah film kaa bad-chadhakar prachaar kiya jaae
 There are also people who are associated with this film
 ja hone ke baad aarthik laabh chaahate hai, aise log, jinhone film kii safalataa par kaaphi paisa laga rakhaa hota he
 It involves a creative process with a well-planned marketing plan
 lekin ek nirdeshak ke taur par film ke prachaar ke peeche uddeshy yah hota he ki sahi log aapaki film ke bare main jaane, un logon kaa dhyaan khinch saken jinhen aap apane kaam se prabhavit karnaa chaahate hai
 The business of pulling viewers has also changed cinema a lot and it is important to inform the consumer audience what you are going to show him
 us seemaa tak marketing film nirmaan kaa ek jaruri hissaa he
 The story of a film is the best publicity for a director
 vah film ke kaarobaari paksh ko itnaa haaavee nahin hone detaa ki kalatmak paksh se samajhaita karnaa pade
 The marketing of the film is necessary up to the point where the people investing in it can be sure that they will get the proper profit for their expenses, as the cost of watching it has increased manifold like the production of the film
 darshak ko film ke saar ke bare main jaananaa jaruri he
 i personally never experienced any conflict between the economic side of my films promotion and my way of making films, because i still prefer the story of the film
 meraa tarika ekadam spasht haih pehle film banane den, phir tay karen ki kaise uskaa prachaar karnaa he
 The best way of marketing a film is to make a good film and you will find that the process of filmmaking is much better than marketing
 yahaan tak ki film rockstar ke prachaar main hamane tab tak koi intervyuu nahin diya, jab tak ki film kii takat ke bare main hamen puri tarah se yakeen nahin ho gaya
 i firmly believe in keeping both processes separate
 ek nirdeshak ke taur par meraa kaam ek acchhee film bananaa he
 The director has to look at various aspects of filmmaking
 lekin mujhe is baat kaa bhi ehsaas he ki is prakriya par media kaa kaaphi prabhaav padataa he
 The funniest part of the film's new marketing strategy is that planners are finding new avenues to reach the audience
 or duusari taraf, darshak film nirmaataaon ko un kshetron kii ore le ja rahe hai, jinhen ve jaananaa chaahate hai
 The biggest change in the Indian film audience is that they are deciding to produce the film, the kind of film they want to see
 isliye film ke prachaar main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga ki darshak pehle se zyada jaankaar ho gaye hai
 The role that i used to play as a director in the promotion of my film has now increased more than ever
 meri pehali reeli
 i gave many interviews at the time of the upcoming film, Socha Na Tha, but my job was just that
 ham ek aise udyog kaa hissaa hai, jisaki kismat film kii reeli
 The first week of h is limited
 us maapdand se sochaa na tha ko flop kaha ja saktaa he
 But i believe that the film has its own release
 ja se pehle chaahe kaisaa bhi prachaar mili, agar vah acchhee film he to pasand kii jaati he or hameshaa un darshakon ko khinchati he, jinhen dhyaan main rakhkar vah banaai gai he
 No one can deny the impact of a film like Apna Apna on the Hindi film audience but it stumbled from the perspective of business
 marketing kaa laabh film kii shuruaati bikri tak hi simit rahata he, vah darshakon kii najar main film kaa bhavishya nahin tay kar sakati
 The director should do what suits his nature and try to ensure the success of the film, rather than going to the stage where he feels uncomfortable
 mere hisaab se asahaj hokar film kaa prachaar karne se use nuksaan hi pahunchataa he
 This uneasiness reflects your apathy, which immediately breaks the audience's connection with the film
 main jaanata hum ki film ke prachaar ke kai manch hai, udhaaharan ke liye koi dance sho, jiske liye ranbir kapur ekadam feet baithenge
 i am not against dance shows, but i would feel uncomfortable with that

 The general public was disturbed during the rjd's Bihar bandh
 jam kii vajah se ek marij kii bhi maut ho gai
 The question arises as to why RJD closed Bihar, whereas the Bihar government has withdrawn the new mining policy which RJD was opposing just a day before the bandh
 aise main band kii aavashyata kyon? isliye taaki apni raajnneeti chamakaayi jaae? RJD ke is virodh ke chalate ek mahila kii jaan chali gai
 RJD activists jammed places all over Bihar against the new mining policy
 RJD adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne ambulance or skool bason ko band se alag rakhaa tha
 Despite this, a woman was killed due to not reaching the hospital on time
 mritak mahila somari devi, mahanaar kii rahane vaali thi
 His family was taking Patna in critical condition
 lekin RJD kii band kii vajah se ambulance jam main funs gaya, jisaki vajah se mahila kii maut hajipur ke paas gandhi sethu toll plaza ke paas ho gai
 There was chaos after the death of the patient
 parijanon kaa kahana he ki wo band samarthakon se guhaar lagaate rahe, lekin kisi ne unki nahin suni
 Appealing to the police, they also ignored
 ambulance marij ko patna pahunchane ke liye subah 7 baje se jam main fansi rahi
 Eventually, the patient died for several hours due to lack of proper treatment
 bihar band hota he to sabase pehle gandhi sethu ko jam kiya jaataa he, jisaki vajah se uttar bihar se aane waalon ko dikkat hoti he
 In today's bandh, dozens of ambulances were stuck on the Gandhi Setu despite the order of the party supremo, in which Somari Devi died
 somari devi ke bete sumit kumaar ne bataaya ki unki maa ko heart atake aayaa tha
 They left from Mehanar at 7 in the morning, but the ambulance near Gandhi Setu's found number one, despite all the efforts, was stuck in a jam for hours and his mother was killed
 sharmasaar karne vaali baat ye he ki ek taraf band ko safal banane ke liye RJD ke kaaryakarta gaanaa bajaanaa kar rahe the, to duusari taraf marij dam tod rahi thi
 After all, who will take responsibility for this death? bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri or argedy ke yuva netaa kehete hai ki unhen vishwaas nahin he ki sarkaar ne nai khanan niti ko waapas liya he
 They are fighting for the poor
 lekin unhen pataa nahin unke is band se kitne garibon kii aaj kii kamai khatm ho gai

 ye mahilaayein zyada padhi- likhi nahin hai, jis vajah se inhen kahin naukari nahin mil paati
 In such a situation, they bear the expenses of their family for a year by making rakhi
 in sabhi mahilaon kii banaai hui rakhiyaan shahar se vishwa ke 24 deshon main supplai kii jaati he
 Annually they earn over 100 crores on their created accounts
 bataa den ki raakhi banane vaale 13 pratishthan mahilaon se raakhi banavaate hai
 The demand for their ashes is very much in the market

 Let me tell you that women have prepared a unit to make sanitary napkins in which only women work
 'anandi senetary napkin'bazaar main milane vaale napkin se 6 rupee kam he
 Which is marketed by women themselves
 is par GST bhi nahin lagata
 The women form self-help groups to make these napkins
 is unit ko sirf 8 mahilaon ne isi saal farvari main shuru kiya he

 media report ke anusaar senetary napkin har jaruratmand mahila ke paas pahunch paaen iske liye jile main 1593 anganhabaadi centre par amrutha corner khole ja rahe he
 Let us tell you that women have also been trained to make sanitary napkins
 vahiin skool college main aise corner khole ja rahai he
 # worldnotobaccoday is the most commonly used in these countries, due to the expensive sanitary napkins found in the smoking market, poor women are unable to use them, which increases the risk of getting dangerous disease
 aise main ye saste napkin mahilaon ke liye kisi vardaan se kam nahin
 Hit and run means being absconding
 agar sisitivi camere naa hon to kai vaardaaton kii hakeekat shaayad hi saamne aa paae
 In such a situation, it is meaningless to punish the justice and punishment to the victim, but now the government is going to bring strict law in such cases of hit and run
 jiske mutabik grih or kanoon mantralay criminal lau bill 2015 draft kar rahi he
 Under this, a new section 304 (A) (2) will be added to the Indian Penal Code and there will be a minimum sentence of 2 years and maximum of 7 years in the hit and run case
 nashe main gaadi chalaane ke maamle main bhi yahi dharaaen lagu hongi
 Currently, there is a maximum sentence of two years in such cases
 saath hi nai dharaaen gairajamaanti hongi
 The comments nae kanoon ke daayre main laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane ke dauraan kisi ke jakhmi hone yaa maut kii haalat main faraar hone ke maamle bhi aaenge
 But the question is that this is enough to make life safe on the road
 aae din sadakon par redlite jump, rang said driving yaa phir duusare kanoon todane kii ghatnaayen aam hai
 According to the data, 70 percent of accidents in the country occur due to intersection or red light jumping
 nangaloi kii 66 saal kii rama devi haadase ke baad se aath hafton ke liye bistar par hai
 Baikaswar hit from behind and tried to escape, but was later caught and a case was also registered
 rama kahati hai ki shaayad main kabhi bistar se uth bhi naa paau kyonki meri haddi bhi umr ke saath budhi ho gai hai or doctoron ko bhi dar he ki shaayad hi ye jute paae
 In such a big question, is it only a strict law for road safety or should there be a change in thinking as well
 iske tahat indian pinal code main ek nayaa section 304(A) (2) joda jayega or hit and ran cese main kam se kam 2 saal or adhiktam 7 saal kii sajaa hogi
 The same clauses will apply in the case of drunk driving
 philhal aise maamalon main adhiktam do saal kii sajaa hoti he
 Also, new streams will be non bailable

 mumbai main aksar anderworld kaa bolabala rahaa he ki lekin duusare shahar bhi jurm ke saae se bachakar nahin rahe
 One such city is Ahmedabad in Gujarat
 kehane ko to yah shahar bahut sampann he lekin anderworld se jude gangster is shahar par bhi raaj karte aae hai
 One of his old name is in the headlines today
 kyonki us gangster kii jindagi par hi aadhaarit he superstar shahrukh khan kii agali film 'rais'
 And the name of that don of Ahmedabad was Abdul Latif
 use gujarat kaa king bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Who was Abdul Latif Abdul Latif used to live in Dariapur area of ahmedabad
 uskaa janm vahiin hua tha
 The family's financial condition was not well
 parivaar bada tha lihaaja ghar ke sabhi log kaam kiya karte the
 Difficult conditions and economic weakness did not give Abdul Latif a chance to read much
 choti umr main hi abdul ko do june kii roti ke liye kaam karnaa padaa
 And at a tender age he started on a path that used to end near death
 jurm kii duniya main pehla kadamchoti si umr main hi abdul latif kaam karne laga tha
 In the 80s he started selling country liquor near Kalupur Overbridge
 bas yaheen se usne jaraayam kii duniya main pehla kadam rakhaa tha
 Gradually he also started selling English liquor
 is kaam se uski acchhee kamai hone lagi thi
 After this, Latif joined the gangsters living in the Kot area of the city in his gang and then joined hands with the arms supplier Sharif Khan
 is tarah latif sharaab ke saath-saath hathiyaaron kii taskari karne laga tha
 Latif had become a gangster in a few years after crossing the threshold of Rajjwani on Gujarat, but he himself never appeared in any gang war
 latif ne bade hi shaatir tareeke se kai chote-mote gang main foot dalwakar unhen apane gang main mila liya
 In this way, after Ahmedabad, his dominance spread throughout Gujarat
 latif ne gujarat main avaidh sharaab bechney kaa network itnaa majboot kar daalaa tha ki vahaan koi bhi botlegar yani avaidh sharaab bechney vaala bina uski marji se sharaab nahin bech saktaa tha
 In the Muslim areas of Latifshahr, Latif was considered to be the messiah of the poor
 vah berozegaar yuvakon ko apni gang main shaamil kar letaa tha
 Due to this, he also started getting political support
 1985 main usne jail main band rahete hue nikaay chunaav main paanch siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 And he won the election in all the seats even while in jail
 jo ki apane aap main ek record tha
 Due to this victory, big leaders had pressed their fingers under the teeth
 daaud se gangvaar, phir dostibataya jaataa he ki isi bich anderworld don daaud ibrahim bhi gujarat ke vadodara main drugs kaa network khadaa kar chukaa tha
 During this time, a gang war broke out between Dawood and Latif
 latif ke gurgon ne daaud ko gher liya or daaud ko vadodara se bhaagna padaa tha
 But later there were reports that Dawood and Latif had become friends
 yahi vajah thi ki mumbai ke serial blast maamle main abdul latif kaa naam bhi aayaa tha
 About 80 cases are registered against Latif
 Abdul Latif was accused in more than 40 murder cases in Gujarat
 jabaki apharan ke bhi lagbhag itane hi maamalon main uskaa naam shaamil he
 Latif was arrested in 1995 from Delhi
 iske baad use sabarmati jail ahmedabad main rakhaa gaya
 In November 1997, Abdul Latif tried to escape once, during which he was killed in an encounter with the Gujarat Police

 The film is based on Latif's life
 latif ke bete mushtak ahamed shaikh ne apni yachika main kaha ki shahrukh khan kii film unke pita kaa naam kharaab kar rahi he
 Not only this, they have claimed defamation of Rs 101 crore, demanding damages in this regard
 mushtak ne film kii relies or pramotional material ke jari hone par bhi roak kii maang kii he
 He says that Latif is misrepresented in the second part of the film
 'rais' main shahrukh khan ke alaava navazuddin siddki or mahiraa khan pramukh bhoomika main he
 'we are living an honored life' Mushtaq says, 'it has been many years since my father Abdul Latif died
 aaj hamaara parivaar samaaj main ek acchhee or izzatdaar jindagi basar kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, people have started talking about the old life of my father Latif once again
 isse hamen samaaj main pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 So many years have passed
 aaj main ek builder hum
 My children study in a good school
 un par film banane kii kya jarurat he
 'gangster Latif has nothing to do, on the other hand, when talking about this film related to Latif's life, Mushtaq's director Rahul Dholakia was told, he said that' Raees' has nothing to do with Latif's life

 rajasthan ke alvar jile main ek parivaar ne apane navjaat shishu kaa naam bhartiya nausena ke wing commander abhinandan (wing Commander Abhinandan) ke naam par rakhaa he
 This baby was born on 1 March when Wing Commander Abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman) was about to leave Pakistan
 bachche ke dada janesh bhutani ne bataaya, ‘‘meri putravadhu ne shuukravaar shaam bete ko janm diya
 We have also named him Abhinandan in honor of the Air Force pilot
 hamen payalat abhinandan (pilot Abhinandan) par garv he isliye hamane parivaar main aae is naye mehmaan kaa naam abhinandan rakhaa he
 He said that the entire family, including his daughter-in-law, had been watching the development on TV for several days
 vahiin, prasuta sapana devi ne kaha, ‘‘abhinandan naam ke jariye main apane bete ko hamaare jabanj payalat kii dilari kii yaad dilaati rahuungi
 i would like my son to grow up to be a brave soldier just like that
 ''yah parivaar alvar ke kishangarh baas main rahata he
 It is noteworthy that Wing Commander Abhinandan's aircraft, which was flying mig 21, fell on the other side of the Line of Control on Wednesday (27 February) and was caught by the Pakistani Army when it jumped from the parachute
 vah shuukravaar (1 March) ko hindustan laute
 Earlier on Wednesday (february 27), a family of Nagaur named their newborn baby Mirage
 miraj (mirage) bhartiya vayusena kaa vah vimaan he jiskaa istemaal niyantran rekha ke paar aatanki thikaanon par hamalon ke liye kiya gaya
 Taking inspiration from this, the couple of Dabra village named their son 'mirage Singh Rathore'
 saare prachaar madhyamon kaa dabaav hamaare man main yah anukulan kar gaya he ki ab bal sahitya beete jamaane kii baat ho gaya
 Now even children are smart who search for the content of knowledge on the internet themselves, and if enough, the libraries of schools give expensive English books
 is aropit yatharth ke bich yah dekhne kii koshish kerani chahie ki hindi main bal sahitya kii vastav main kya sthiti he? yah sahi baat he ki samay rukta nahin or chijen lagaataar badalati hai
 The pollen of the sixties and seventies is not the same as the Nandan of the eighties and nineties, but a lot of new and pleasant things have also gone unnoticed
 is nae ko dekhnaa hamaari bhashaa or samskruti main nai peedi ke liye ho rahi taiyaari kaa imtihaan bhi he kyonki yahaan ruchi paidaa hone par ham ummid kar sakenge ki aage bachche hamaari bhashaa ke mahaan sahitya ke bhi pathak bane
 Along with the National Book Trust (NBT) and Eklavya, the organizations working for children's literature, now Taxila has also made this land fertile with beautiful-level publications
 bacchon kii patrikaon kaa kalevar badla he or nai patrikaayen bhi ai hai
 At the World Book Fair in Delhi in early 2019, this time there was a children's gathering at the stall of Taxila with Eklavya, NBT
 yahan se ek nayi patrika cycle kii shuruyaat hui he jo hindi main apurv maani jaaegi
 Quality original material like Sushil Shukla's editing has appeared in this two-wheeled magazine of children, it is seen occasionally in our language
 vigyaan patrika kaa tag lagaae bina saamaajik-saanskrithik or taarkik saamagree se bhari yah patrika vaigyanik drushtikon liye he
 Some of the authors of the magazine's entry were Vinod Kumar Shukla, Asghar Wajahat, Arun Kamal, Anamika, Krishna Kumar, Priyamvad, painters Akhilesh, Udayan Vajpayee, Irshad Kamil, Krishna Baldev Vaid, Naresh Saxena, Rajesh Joshi, Vishnu Nagar , Ashok Bhowmik and Manglesh Dabral
 kisse-kahaniyaan, sansmaran, yatra vrittant, kavitaayen or dher pathneey saamagree se taiyaar cycle ke ank lagaataar aa rahe hai or is patrika ne hindi sahitya ke us puraane bhed ko mitaane kii safal koshish kii he jahaan mana ja rahaa tha ki bacchon or bado ke liye likhane vaale sahityakar bhinn-bhinn hote hai
 Pluto is being brought out of another magazine under the editing of Sushil Shukla
 yah zyada chote bacchon ke liye he, jisamen drishy adhik prabhaavshaalee hai
 It is pleasant to see that through these journals, Shukla also prepares a way to publish new books of children's literature in Hindi
 cycle or pluto kaa prakaashan kar rahi takshashila ajukeshan socity ne in patrikaon ke saath anek pustakon or postaron kaa bhi prakaashan kiya he jinke sambandh main pehali baat yah kehani hogi ki gahare saundaryabodh or suruchi se inhen taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Secondly, the purpose of this whole children's literature is not the production of educative literature because the literature of the elders is not even for any learning but this literature has become superior because it aims to generate interest, curiosity, aesthetic and curiosity
 jugnu prakaashan kii badi safalataa is tathy main bhi he ki isane hindi ke shreshth lekhakon ko bacchon ke vaaste likhane ko taiyaar kar liya
 Among these people are well-known authors like Prakash, Wajahat, Vinod Kumar Shukla, Priyamvand, translation of foreign best children's literature is also included in these books
 is kram main vajahat kii choti-choti kahaniyon (yaa sanvaadon) kii pustak ranu main kya janu? swayan prakaash kii hanji naaji or sappu ke dost, priyanvad kii mitti kii gaadi, sunita kii mor duungri, dow nagesh pandeya sanjay kii peeth par bastaa, virendra dube kii chaar chatore, shyaam susheel kii bakrii ke saath, proiti roy kii jab main moti ko ghar laai pramukh hai
 Foreign translation books include Maninnja Musil's Kissu Elephant (slovakia), Nahid Kazmi's The Orange House, Ahmed Raza Ahmadi's reunion, and Babak Sabri's great friend (the trio of Iran) is a very enriching experience
 isi tarah bal kavitaaon ke chote-chote chayan cheentee chadhi pahaad or chaand kii roti sheershak se chaape hai
 An extensive book Binsu has also been published from here which has been printed in a large size of about 125 hundred pages as a Madhubani-style painting
 yah boarding skool main pard rahe baarah varshiya biksu kii kahani he jisamen ghar kii yaad ke saath nai duniya or jivan ke anubhavon kaa sundar sangyojan he
 Most of the books that have come up have been built on the ground that they should be interesting books to communicate to the citizens and prepare them for big questions in place of children teaching or teaching
 sappu ke dost main swayan prakaash kii kahaniyaan khaas tarah ke nostalgia ke saath jivan ke yatharth ko maje-maje main dekhne kii kavayad he to vajahat apni sawaal-jawaab style main aisi kahaniyaan rachate hai ki bachche bado ke kaan katate najar aate hai
 Shouldn't they get answers? In search of answers to these questions, Prakash's own small book, Haji Nazi, has been composed, which sometimes gives fun to others and sometimes creates annoyance with sharp questions
 yahi baat he jo dharre vaale hindi bal sahitya se in kitabon ko alag or sarthak banaati he
 In fact, it must be said that Sushil Shukla's editing vision and Taxila's experiments have ended the ever-present division of Hindi literature under which only child writers were written for children and who are considered to be the so-called mainstream writers
 , They were also hesitant to look at this side
 kahana na hoga ki is vibhaajan ne kitna nuksaan kiya he
 a new book to note in these new books is that of Sunita
 chitrakaar-kathakaar sunita apni kitaab mor duungri main rajasthani parivesh kii adivasee kala ke saath apni kahani kahati hai jo stri vimarsh ke halle ke bina bhi gender jaise sawaal par samvedansheel bana jaati he
 Shyam Sushil creates poetry for very young children: goat ears shaken, Munni sings
 isi tarah proiti roy gali ke kute moti kii kahani sunaati hai
 This small book of children's fascination with nature and the living world can soak even the elders
 in kitabon ke saath jugnu prakaashan ne kuch aisi kitaaben bhi chhaapi hai jo kishoron ke liye hai
 In all these books, there is a lot of hard work on the pictures with content
 atanu roy, alan shaw, bhargav kulkarni, devabrata ghosh, nabarina singh, proiti roy, taposhi ghoshaal jaise samarth chitrakaaron ne in kathaon, rachanaaon ko pathakon ke man par utaarne ko kunchi se shandaar kaam kiya he or kitabon ke aavaran par lekhak ke saath unhen credit bhi mila he
 The National Book Trust is an autonomous undertaking of the Government of India that provides children's literature at the lowest cost
 yahaan se haal main kuch acchhee kitaaben ai hai
 For example, Tripurari Sharma's Alu, Vinayak's Alive Ajayaghar, Prem Saroop Srivastava's a spectacle like this, Suresh Yadav's golden stone, Neelam Saxena Chandra's Kasam of Muddy Mushroom, Sarvendra Vikram's Sabzi Mandi and Kshama Sharma and Devendra Kumar's Chosen Child stories
 tripurari sharma kii alu sabase rochak he jo ek ullu ke bachche kii kahaniyon se nirmit hui he
 This is what we call imaginativeness to make children eager to see what seems impossible
 alu kii jindagi or uskaa sangharsh irshaad captain kii kuchi or tripurari sharma kii kalam se aise jeevant hue hai ki nigaah or man kitaab main atka rah jaae
 Chandra's swear of muddy mushrooms and Sarvendra Vikram's vegetable market take the readers to the invisible sides of real life
 pataa nahin kyon, nyaas ne apni lagbhag pachaas saal puraani is pustak shrunkhlaa se 'nehru bal pustkaalay' kaa vah pratik chinh ab hataa diya he jisamen nehru kii yaad dilaataa gulab kaa phool kitaab ke upar ek kone main hota tha
 Anyway jis bhashaa main aisi sundar kitaaben banane kaa utsaah dikhaai detaa ho vahaan yah kahana ki bachche kitaab nahin padhate, asal main hamaari asafalataa he or yah aisi pustakon, prayogon tak nahin pahunch paane se upajati he
 Trust books are now more easily available, so all these books can also be purchased online as the internet is accessible
 haa, yah shikaayat bhi kii ja sakati he ki in patrikaon or kitabon ke daam bahut munasib nahin hai, tab bhi vikalpaheenata ke banjarapan ko mitaati in kitabon ko kharidne main itani mushkil nahin lagegi
 Efforts should be made that children read and learn the literature of their language, only then they might start loving their language and culture sometime

 The police is currently investigating the whole case and the criminals are being tried to crack

 ) US President Donald Trump addressed the nation on Thursday night
 unke sambodhan main border mudda chaaya rahaa jiskaa miljul kar hal nikaalane par unhone jor diya
 President Trump described the condition of the us-mexico border as 'a growing crisis' and drew attention to the surrounding countries
 is masale ke hal ke liye or mexico border par steel kii diwaar banane ke liye raashtrapati trump ne 5
 Demanded 7 billion dollars
 raashtrapati ne ovel offis se pehali baar raashtra ko sambodhit kiya aurborderaki samasya nipataane ke liye logon se aage aane kii apil kii
 In his address on television on Thursday night, he drew the attention of the Democrats and termed it as a major crisis of human and people's hearts and minds
 saath hi trump ne suraksha or logon kii bhalaai ke liye jitna jald ho sake funding par jor diya
 The US President made a special appeal to the Democrats and urged them to meet at the White House
 unhone itnaa tak kah diya ki 'desh ke netaaon kaa kuch na karnaa isse bada aniatik kuch nahin ho saktaa
 'it is worth mentioning that since Trump has come to power, he has been more strongly against illegal migrants
 ise band karne kaa ve kai baar pran le chuke hai
 Trump believes that a steel wall should be built to prevent migrants from across the cross-border border, but they want to ensure their participation as the wall is more expensive
 iske liye unhone desh ke kharch main katautee kaa bhi prastaav diya he
 However, critics do not agree with Trump's assertions and believe that the issue of security is being exaggerated and served in the name of humanity
 america main yah mudda isliye bhi zyada garam he kyonki trump border samasya ko rashtriya apatkaal ghoshit kar diwaar bananaa chaahate hai lekin pichhali raat tak unhone aisa koi elaan nahin kiya
 Democrats on the other hand are against funding for the wall because it is unethical and useless to erect a wall on the border
 democrates kaa kahana he ki is mudde ko sambandhit sarkaron se baat kar hi suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Earlier, Trump has said that he is ready for partial government shutdown for many years
 sarkari kambandi kaa yah teesraa saptaah he
 Because of this shutdown, 8,00,000 employees have not received their salaries since December 22
 trump ne haal main ek press conference main kaha ki ham rashtriya apatkaal ghoshit kar sakate hai or diwaar kaa jald nirmaan kar sakate hai
 i have not done it yet
 main yah kar saktaa hum
 If we can do it through dialogue, we will do it better
 trump ne seemaa par cement kii diwaar ke nirmaan ke bajaae steel kii diwaar banane ke vikalp par bhi vichaar kiya
 However, he did not provide much information on this possibility
 unhone kaha ki diwaar nirmaan ke liye 5
 There is an urgent need of $ 6 billion because we are not talking about sports, we are talking about national security

 The UP ATS is closely watching over a dozen youngsters affected by the ideology of the terrorist organization ISIS in Uttar Pradesh
 inamen se 12 ladke abhi apane gharon par hai jabaki chaar ko sandigdh paae jane par giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 All four are currently in jail
 uttar pradesh ke kainujavaanonko soshal media ke jariye jehad kii taraf le jane kii koshish ko jaanch agenciyon ne benakaab kar diya he
 Similarly, a big module was also revealed last year
 tabhi se uttar pradesh main rahane vaale takreeban 16 ladakon par aties kii kadi najar he
 Out of which 4 boys found suspicious have been arrested and sent to jail
 jabaki 12 yuvak apane gharon par hai
 UP ATS IG Asim Arun gave this information in a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 is exclusive baatcheet main aiji aseem arun ne bataaya ki sandigdh paae gaye sabhi 16 ladakon ko di-radicalij kiya ja rahaa he
 They are being negotiated
 jo chaar ladke jail main band hai, unase bhi aties lagaataar sampark main he
 According to IG ATS, all boys are being told the right way of religion by meeting good maulanas
 yahi nahin unhen skill deveopment se jude course bhi karwaae ja rahe hai
 Those who are in jail, their jobs will also be thought of when they come out
 jo ladke baahar hai, unhen alag-alag prashikshan dilaayaa ja rahaa he
 According to IG Asim, boys are being targeted through social media
 jaal main funsane vaale zyaadaatar berozegaar yuvak hai
 Or there are those who have a minor criminal history
 ek baar koi ladkaa inke jaal main funs jaae to use jehad or paise kaa laalach diya jaataa he
 IG said that the conversation started with that young man on Telegram Messenger
 aise main hamaari najar sab par bani hui he
 These 16 boys are expected to start a new life after de-radicalization
 bharat ke har naagarik ko vishisht pahchaan pradaan karne vaala aadhaar naye saal main bade badlaavon ke liye taiyaar he
 In the coming year, its offline confirmation facility will pick up speed and 12-digit unique identification number will no longer be mandatory for new bank accounts and mobile connections
 is saal aadhaar kii sanvaidhanik manyata ke bare main ucchtam nyaayalay ke aitihaasik faisle or anya ghatnakramon ke baad 2019 main bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran (yuidiai) aadhaar card ko adhik vyaavhaarik or upyogi banane kii disha main kaam karegaa
 Under this, the emphasis will be to move Aadhaar to offline usage through mediums like e-aadhaar and QR code
 aise madhyamon main aadhaar card dharakon ko apni boometric pahchaan jaahir karne kii jarurat nahin hogi, in prakriyaaon ke is saal gati pakadaney kii sambhaavna he
 It is worth mentioning that Aadhaar was needed in school enrollment, marriage certificate, payment of tax and getting new mobile connection and it became the first choice for identifying a person
 haalanki yah 1
 22 crore Aadhaar remained true for card holders until it arose that suspicion that the use of Aadhaar for ordinary services would interfere with people's privacy
 iske baad ucchtam nyaayalay ne biomitric aadhaarit vishwa ke sabase bade databes ko sanvaidhanik manyata to de di, lekin isaki anivaaryta ko naye sire se paribhaashit kiya
 The apex court, by a vote of four, said in its judgment that Aadhaar will remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allocating PAN numbers
 haalanki, doorsanchaar evam anya kshetra kii nijee companiyon ko logon kii boometric jaankaree kii pushti ke liye di gai anumati ko adaalat ne nirast kar diya
 This shocked the government's ambitious plan to make Aadhaar mandatory for various services
 is aitihaasik faisle ke baad bank, doorsanchaar companiyaan or vittiya praudyogiki jaisi companiyaan graahakon kii pahchaan kii pushti ke liye ek baar phir se anya vikalp dhundne main lag gayi
 These companies were beginning to rely heavily on Aadhaar e-kyc
 iske turant baad yuidiai kuar (quick respance) code or i-aadhaar jaise anya vikalp lekar aayaa
 An article on social media is viral

 Twitter gave its information by tweeting

 Now you will be able to tweet about 280 characters on Twitter soon
 twitor ne iske liye test karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Informed himself from Twitter co-founder Jake Dorsey
 This is a small change, but a big move for us
 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit
 Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet
 And at the same time carrying our brevity, speed, and essence! Https: / / t
 co / tuhj51mstu— jack (@jack)september 26, 2017aise hogi testingtesting process ke dauraan chunindatvitaryugers ko 280 karactors vaale twit karne kii suvidha milegi
 After this, the 280-character tweet will become a reality for everyone if the test is successful
 text ke dinon se hi twit main karactors kii sankhya limited thi
 Initially after 160 characters, its number was reduced to 140
 company ne apane is faisle ke bare main blog ke jariye bataaya
 According to the blog post, due to the limited number of characters, many times users had to remove certain words
 kai baar to is vajah se log twit hi nahin karte the
 In such a situation, when 140 users are freed from the limit of 140 characters, many new people will join Twitter
 twitor ko bharosa he ki karactor seemaa badhane se zyada se zyada log ab zyada se zyada twit karenge
 This was not the first time the decision was postponed
 Twitter has taken a step towards increasing the number of characters
 isse pehle 2016 ke shuruyaat main bhi twitor karactor kii sankhya 10 hajaar karne par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahaa tha
 At the time, CEO Jack Dorsey had retreated at the last moment and that update was not implemented

 com / fudvxv1nr4 — BJP (@ bjp4india) November 7, 2017 The political point of the video is that this video of BJP will like anti-mayawati society
 khaskar agadon main ise ek jaateey jeet kii tarah prasaarit hote dekha ja sakegaa
 People will say that look at how this troubled Dalit leader who had been doing politics on the basis of money
 lekin isi video main ek antarvirodh he ki daliton ko rijhaane main lagi bhaajapa ke jo nae-nae dalit samarthak bane hai, unhen is tarah se mayawati kaa uphaas nagavar guzar saktaa he
 It is also surprising that the bjp's latest attack on Mayawati comes at a time when she is seen as politically weak and marginalized
 darasal, agadon ko notebandi kii jo chot lagi he, bhaajapa use jati sangharsh main dalit pahchaan vaali netaa ke bade nuksaan ke nerative main badalane kii koshish kar rahi he
 It is the same neuter whose happiness was being given to the poor, who were happy after demonetisation thinking that even more huge treasures of the rich have become useless
 mayawatigujaratmen bahut praasangik nahin hai, naa hi daliton kii aabaadi gujarat main bahut badi or nirnaayak he
 Yes, but Modi ji wants to tell the story of injury to Mayawati and tell her how much sorrow is there in the world, how much less your sorrow is

 Another Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, Munaf Hakimin, resigned from the party on Friday

 Earlier on Friday, party MP Tariq Anwar also left the NCP and also resigned from the Lok Sabha

 In Maharashtra, he was counted as the big face of the party
 munaf istipha dene tak party ke mahasachiv pad par karyrat the
 Apart from joining the founding leaders of NCP, he was also the chairman of the State Minorities Commission
 hakim se pehle anwar neensipichhodane ke saath-saath loksabhaa se bhi istipha de diya
 Anwar formed NCP in 1999 along with Karshard Pawar, rebel against Congress on the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin
 tarik anwar ne ajtak se istipha dene kii baat ko sweekaara or kaha, 'maine ensipi chhod di he or loksabhaa se bhi istipha de diya he
 Tariq Anwar said, i did not like Pawar saheb's statement on Rafael
 ensipi kii taraf se safai ai lekin wo sahi nahin he
 When Pawar saheb had given the statement, he should have clarified himself
 haalanki unki taraf se khud koi safai nahin ai to maine istipha de diya
 On the question of which party will go after leaving NCP, Tariq Anwar said that it is not decided yet
 samarthakon se baat karne ke baad tay karuunga
 i will tell you after this sutron kii maane totarik anvarensipi se istipha dene ke baad ek baar phir congress main vaapasi kar sakate hai

 Surprisingly, he made this decision in an interview given by Pawar to a news channel, while all the facts about Rafael are almost clear
 It is a sad day for us that our senior colleague has decided to quit Lok Sabha&also NCP
 It's very surprising because he has based his decision on an interview by Sharad Pawar to news channel wherein facts are very clear on # Rafale: Praful Patel, NCP on Tariq Anwar quitting partypic

 Due to which the public is losing, the image of the party is also deteriorating
 pravesh verma kii baat kaa samarthan kai or saansadon ne bhi kiya
 BJP President Amit Shah exhorted the mps to recognize their power as mps
 apane kshetra kaa jimmaa puri tarah apane haath main le or centre kii nitiyon ko pahuchaayen
 The PM will take reports of changes, such dinners will also be held with Manohar Parrikar, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Nitin Gadkari to resolve the complaints of the mps
