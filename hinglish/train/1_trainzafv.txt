 Earlier, in the conclusion of the Jamiat Ulema Hind National Working Committee meeting held on 15 November to review the Supreme Court's decision on the Ayodhya case, Chairman Maulana Arshad Madani had said that the court's decision was beyond comprehension
 kanoon or nyaay kii najar main vahaan babari masjid thi or he or qayaamat tak masjid hi rahegi phir chaahe usko koi bhi naam yaa swaroop kyon na de diya jaae
 Madani had said that one thing is clear from the court's decision that the mosque was not built by breaking a temple nor did it take place at the site of a temple

 a patient suffering from terrible abdominal pain underwent successful surgery through a robot in a hospital here
 is marij kii beemaari beemaari durlabh kism kii thi, lekin is surgery ke baad marij ko dard se raahat mil gai
 This rare disease occurs in any one of 100,000 people
 ise 'siliek artery compressant syndrome' kehete hai
 It is identified by the pain arising from the compression of the celiac artery into the abdomen
 maujuuda samay main shalya chikitsa hi iskaa ek maatr vikalp he
 In this, the ligament is removed, which causes pressure
 haalanki siliek dhamni tak paaramparik shalya chikitsa se pahunchnaa aasaan nahin he, kyonki yah diaphram ke neeche sthit hoti he
 Sturig Hospital's gastro-intestinal surgeon Apoorva Vyas said in a statement on Friday, "the use of a four-handed surgical robot involves the celiac artery
 ke mul tak pahunchane main sakasham rahaa, jahaan maanav kii ungliyaan nahin pahunch saktin
 " vyas ne kaha, "main marij ke swasthya laabh ko dekhakar khush hum

 pichley saal uttar pradesh main sapa kii shandaar jeet ke baad aise kayaas lagaae jane lage the ki 'netaji' yani samaajawaadee party ke adhyakshamulaayam singh yadavacentre kii raajnneeti main halchal machayenge
 He told his workers to be ready for the mid-term elections
 unke utsaah se lagata tha ki teesraa morcha ek baar phir ubhar saktaa he
 But nothing happened even after the Trinamool Congress left the coalition government at the Center
 kuch log maanate hai ki congress ne sapa kaa samarthan barkaraar rakhane ke liye mulaayam singh parivaar ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle ko hathiyaar bana rakhaa he, haalanki netaji ise saidhantik muddon par samarthan maanate hai
 This time he has asked his workers to be ready for elections in September
 desh kii rajnatik dasha-disha par india today group ke channel aaj tak ke ashok singhl se unki baatcheet ke pramukh ansh:aap baar-baar kyon kehete hai ki chunaav samay par nahin honge, jaldi chunaav honge, sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa nahin karegi
 Sometimes we talk about September, sometimes mid-term elections, what is the reason? No, i have said once
 or is aadhaar par kaha he ki sarkaar har morche par asafal rahi he
 The promises made to the public, will remove poverty, remove unemployment, and remove inflation
 to mahangaai badi he, berogari badi he, or rojgaar de nahin sake
 One, the yield of the farmers was reduced, from which they could not get their fair price
 majdoor jo kheton main kaam karte hai, factoriyon main kaam k rate hai, unke liye bhi jo ghoshnaptr main kaha vah bhi puraa nahin kar paae
 So overall whether it is hone, laborers, businessmen, poor, lawyers, be it state employees or shopkeepers for whom they have not been able to fulfill the promises made
 aarthik sthiti or zyada kharaab ho rahi he
 He had said that the country's economic situation will be fixed very soon, another said that it will reduce inflation
 khatm kar denge
 So my point was that if you cannot eliminate inflation, you could have stopped it, it could have stopped inflation
 jab sarkaar inako mili thi, usee vakt jo mahangaai thi utani hi rahati to bhi nahin rah pai
 So inflation increased, poverty increased, unemployed increased, farmers' yields decreased
 kisaan barbaad ho gaya
 And the biggest inflation hit the poor
 kisaanon kii jo paidaavaar thi, use saste daam par liya gaya or jab usko khareednaa padaa tab mahangaa bechaa gaya
 Now all these fronts are unsuccessful
 ab ve bajet acha rakhane kii koshish karenge ve chunavi bajet se chunaav laduya chaahate hai
 This is his last budget
 kyonki aglaa to ve pesh nahin kar paaenge
 The next budget will be presented by the new ones
 isiilie is bajet main kuch achche kaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 And those who will do well, they are going among the people to fight the elections
 ye hamaari jaankaree he or main samajhataa bhi or inke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Repeatedly, mid-term elections can be held, but the government is continuing its support, what is the compulsion? Our compulsion is none
 hamaara saidhantik sawaal he
 We have fought against the communal powers and the Samajwadi Party will continue to fight against the communal powers
 to sawaal yah he ki ek taraf he bijepi or ek taraf congress or teesraa morcha united nahin he, varanaa tisare morche kaa bahumat ho jaataa
 Our theory is that the Samajwadi Party has fought against the Communal Force
 or hindustan main doosraa yadi sahyog mila he to left party kaa mila he or is bich main sampradayikta se na bijepi se congress ladi he na or koi ladaa he
 The Samajwadi Party has fought, and from time to time the Samajwadi Party has supported the Left parties
 agar aap chunaav kii baat kar rahe hai, aapaki party taiyaar he chunaav ke liye to bijepi aarope lagaati he ki mulaayam ngkshasah ji samarthan waapas len tabhi to chunaav honge
 Not withdrawing support because the election is head on
 aapaki party agar taiyaar he to samarthan waapas kyon nahin le lete?agar aisa koi mudda aayega, jaisaa ki janvirohi koi mudda aayega
 Within the Lok Sabha, the Samajwadi Party may consider giving or not supporting
 abhi tak aisa koi janvirohi kaam nahin aayaa he
 There is only one thing which is in front of the people of the whole country
 ve do kaam hai
 One is inflation, the other is unemployment
 muddon par aap samarthan vaapasi kii maang kyon nahin k rate hai? ye donon aam aadmi se jude hue kaam hai
 You say that this government is working against the common man
 to ye to bahut bade mudde hai aapke saamne
 If we withdraw support in the middle, the Congress government will not fall if we return it
 ham koi chhipaane vaali baat nahin kah sakate
 Because even if the Samajwadi Party withdraws support, the Congress still has a majority
 isi siddhant ke aadhaar par aise mudde aapane dekhe honge jin muddon par hamane congress sarkaar kaa samarthan nahin kiya, epadi kaa virodh kiya, kas ke virodh kiya utana kisi ne nahin ki yaa, jitna samaajawaadee party ne ki yaa
 And other issues came before it
 un muddon kaa bhi virodh ki yaa samaajawaadee party ne
 Did not vote for Congress
 lekin mulaayam singh ji, vipaksh bhi sawaal uthaata he ki sadan ke andar kai muddon par aap sarkaar ke saath dikhaai dete hai, or kai muddon par virodh main
 So the situation is not very clear
 kanfusion he
 Our policy is clear
 samaajawaadee party kabhi bhi duvidhaavaadi party nahin he
 On the basis of the policies that are ours, whether it is in the Lok Sabha or inside the Parliament or outside, the Samajwadi Party runs on the same policies
 yah baat sahi he ki samaajawaadee party stand leti he
 Be it the issue of presidential elections, or the issue of FDI or inflation
 lekin sawaal yaheen aakar atak jaataa he
 AAP had allotted seats for the election some time back
 loksabhaa siton ko lekar to aap jab taiyaar hai, sarkaar gire yaa na gire, janata ke mudde par aap aage bad sakate hai
 We are leaving
 hamaari party chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 And declared as many candidates as there were to contest in Uttar Pradesh
 ek or bada sawaal uthta he
 You also face those issues that the government is taking support from you by showing fear of CBI
 samarthan jari he
 It's not like this
 ye sahi he ki dilli kii sarkaar ke do hi kaam hai, ek sibiai or doosraa aarthik maamle ko lekar congress party ne vipaksh ko hameshaa dabaane kii koshish kii he
 But Samajwadi Party will always be on its policies
 chaahe sibiai kii baat ho, chaahe or kisi tarah se aarthik nuksaan karaane kaa maamla ho
 Yes it is
 inke haath main ek to he inakam tex or ek sibiai
 So this government is fully using income tax and CBI
 hameshaa
 So you must have tried to put pressure on you too? CBI has been put behind us
 lekin sadan main aapane dekha hoga hamane apni nitiyon se samjhauta nahin kiya
 Mulayam Singh ji, one more thing: (congress) also made Rahul Gandhi the vice-president
 aapako kya lagata he? kitne bade netaa hai ve, usase party kaa kalyaan hoga? kayakalp hoga?wo congress jane, ham apni party ke bare main kah sakate hai
 What is the Congress
 kitna ummid he, kitna ummid karke chal rahe hai, to ye to koi nai baat he nahin
 This was already decided
 sonia ji netaa thim, uske pehle rajeev the, uske pehle indira thim
 You know sabakaa naam kyon laate ho? netaa vahi hai or vahaan par ki si kii himmat he nahin
 The courage to say the right thing is not there
 vahaan party ke andar jab meeting hoti he to suna karte hai log, kisi kii himmat nahin he koi baat aisi waisi kah sake
 Religious and educational institutions in the country collected a lot of donations from the public in the name of religion and social service, but mostly kept depositing them in banks instead of spending them on charity
 in sansthaaon kii ore se bainkon main chaar lakh karod rupee se adhik kii rakam jamaa ho chuki he
 After examining the income tax return i
e
 Form 7 of such institutions, the Finance Ministry has found that most of the money has been misused by the tax exemption facility in income tax
 modi sarkaar ab tex chhot ke naam par kii gai chori ko band karne kii pahal karne ja rahi he
 An investigation of four years of tax returns has revealed that the trusts have shown some more in their tax accounts and the tax liability has come out a bit more
 'zyaadaatar maamle nijee shaikshanik or dharmik sansthaaon ke hai
 The government is considering to tighten the new income tax to prevent misuse of tax exemption
 ' vitt mantralay ke aalaa adhikari ne naam na chhapane kii shart par india today ko ye jaankaree di
 The money of 15 percent income rebate is being deposited in banks for many years by not spending in charity related work
 agar trust gupt daan ke jariye paisa lete hai or us paise kaa usase jude kaamon par kharch nahin karte hai to sarkaar tees fisadi kaa tex laga sakati he
 The government is aware that some trusts take checks in cash instead of cash for personal gain
 trust ke liye maujuuda tex niyantrust kii inakam tex free hoti he
 To encourage investment in social welfare work, the government waives 15% of the trust without any proof, but the rest 85% of the amount has to be accounted for by tax exemption
 85 fisadi paise ko paanch saal ke bheetar kharch karnaa hota he, lekin vitt mantralay ke aankade bataate hai ki trust tex chhot kaa galat istemaal kar rahe hai
 Tax exemption is available to spend money on charity work, but trusts are using this exemption to add money
 paisa jodne ke liye khaastaur par 15 fisadi vaale hisse kaa jamkar istemaal ho rahaa he
 The task force, set up to ease the new income tax law, is scheduled to submit a report to the Finance Ministry in the last week of July, on the basis of which a new tax law is to be enacted
 sarkaar is nae tex kanoon main trust par nakel kas sakati he
 Along with bringing the tax free amount of 15 per cent to the tax net, it can also fix the time limit for spending it
 iske alaava nagdi main lenden puri tarah manaa ho saktaa he
 It is also expected to ban tax exemption by showing expenses in the name of activity for charity
 shaikshanik sansthaaon par ho sakati he sakhtiswa vittposhit or anaregulatod shaikshanik sansthaaen chande ke taur par baari bharkam paisa jod rahi hai
 According to sources in the Finance Ministry, the government may withdraw the tax exemption above 15% income in the new tax law
 iske alaava aisi sansthaaon ko kharch karne kii samay seemaa ke baad, bache paise par bhi tex dena pad saktaa he
 All types of charitable trust income tax returns fill ITR 7

 mount everest par bheed badhati ja rahi he
 Whichever one sees, he has the power to climb Everest
 ab wo din nahin rahe jab everest kaa naam sunakar ruh kaanp jaati thi
 Now people are climbing Everest to enjoy records, less to make records
 iskaa nateeja ye he ki ab vahaan bhi vatting list dekhi ja rahi he
 When one batch broke, the other arrived
 is kaaran haadase to bad hi rahe hai, jahaan tahaan kachare kaa dher bhi jamaa ho rahaa he
 To avoid this, the Government of Nepal is thinking of many tricks
 sarkaar kuch aise niyam kanoon laane ja rahi he taaki everest kii chadhaai mahaj tafari ban kar na rah jaae
 Climbing will be difficult According to the New York Times report, those climbing Everest must first prove that they have climbed to another peak
 niyam kanoon ke daayre main ab tourism companiyaan bhi aaengi jo apane clyant vahaan le jaati hai
 Tourism companies have to show that they have 3 years of experience in this matter
 jo company pichley teen saal se everest cliembers ko le jaati rahi he, use hi tarjeeh di jaaegi
 Cost cutting also dominates Everest climbing
 yani har koi kam se kam paise main baaji maar lenaa chahta he
 This has had an impact on the companies that organize Everest's ascent
 un par kam se kam paise main logon ko le jane kaa dabaav he
 Due to cost cutting, people are losing their lives
 aise kai kisse sunne main aae ki everest par chadhaai karne vaala dal laapata ho gaya
 Rescuers later rescued the climbers after much effort
 is par nakel kasne ke liye nepal sarkaar chadhaai kii fees badhaane kii taiyaari main he
 The climbing companies may have to pay up to 35 thousand dollars
 atirikt shulk jod kar yah kharch 50 hajaar dollar tak pahunch saktaa he
 Many perks will be able to get permits, now it will not happen that i felt that is why i went to climb Everest
 everest par chadhane se pehle kai tarah ke test honge jinamein sehat or cliembing skill bhi shaamil hai
 The permit will be issued only after observing fitness test and climbing skills
 maujuuda niyam ke mutabik chadhaai karne waalon se passport kii ek copy, biodata or health certificate maanga jaataa he
 The problem in this is that the Nepali administration is not able to investigate the health of the people as to how correct the certificate was written
 ab everest kaa permit keval use hi milegaa jo pehle 21,300 feet kii unchai tak ja chukaa he
 Conspiracy in the name of climbing! Climbing Everest is a strong source of Nepal's earnings
 isse nepal sarkaar ko kaaphi rajasav miltaa he
 Everest climbing was commercialized in 1990
 arthath 1990 ke baad nepal sarkaar ne everest chadhane waalon se paisa vasuulana shuru kiya
 Anyone can go to Everest after paying the specified amount, but a big conspiracy came out
 pataa chalaa ki kuch guide, helicopter companiyaan or aspataalon ne kamai ke liye baari gadabadjhaalaa kiya taaki insurance kaa paisa hadapaa ja sake
 This severely upset the Government of Nepal
 jagahansai or badanaami se bachane ke liye nepal prashasan ne kai kadam uthaae
 These steps also include some strict rules of law, which will allow Everest to pass on to the same people who will be entitled to it

 1952 main pehali barrashtrapati chunaavhue
 Since then, this is the 15th election for this post
 raashtrapati pad ke liye 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967 or 1969 main hue chunaavon main yah dekhne main aayaa ki nirvaachit hone kii koi aashaa nahin hone par bhi kuch logon ne namakan patr bhare
 Some individuals even challenged it in court, taking the election for the presidency lightly
 1974 main niyamon main badlaavin khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye 1974 main raashtrapati or uparashtrapati pad ke chunaav se jude kanoonon main badlaav kiya gaya
 In 1974 it was provided that a nomination letter of a candidate should be accompanied by at least 10 electors as a support proposer and 10 electors as secondary
 saath hi jamaanti rakam 2500 rupee (us samay ke hisaab se zyada) kar di gai or yah bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya ki agar koi chunaav yachika daayar kii jaati he to vah sirf supreme court main khud us ummidavaar dwaara daayar kii jaani chahie jo chunaav lard rahaa tha or uske saath kam se kam 20 nirvaachak bhi yachikakarta ke rup main hon

 jamaanat kii rakam 2500 se badhaakar 15000 rupee kar di gai
 There were 17 candidates in the fray for presidential elections in 1967 and 15 in 1969, but after the above changes in the law, their number decreased drastically
 uske baad se ab tak kisi bhi chunaav main chaar se adhik ummidavaar nahin rahe

 Employees of the debt-ridden public sector airline company Air India may face salary woes in the coming days
 darasal, air india ke paas oktober ke baad karmchaariyon ko selary dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 This information has been given by two big government officials
 haal hi main sarkari telecom company BSNL ne bhi karmchaariyon ko selary dene ke liye sarkaar se madad maangi thi
 An official told the Economic Times news that the government had given a sovereign guarantee to Air India for an amount of Rs 7,000 crore and the company now has Rs 2,500 crore left
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ye rakam tel companiyon, airport operataron or anya vendors kaa bakaayaa chukaane ke alaava kuch maheenon kii selary dene main kharch ho jaaenge
 It is speculated that after October, Air India may have to face salary crisis
 sarkari adhikari ke mutabik air india pichley kuch maheenon se iskaa bhugtan deree se kar rahi he
 According to another official, the company had also given May salary with a delay of 10 days
 bataa den ki air india har maheene selary par 300 karod rupee kharch karti he
 Efforts are being done to disinvest Air India
 For a long time, the government is trying to disinvest Air India but the buyers are not getting it
 haal hi main sadan main baari udyog or lok udhyam mantri arvind ganpat saamvat ne air india ke vinievesh ko lekar jaankaree di he
 Actually, the disinvestment process is the reverse of investment
 jahaan nivesh kisi kaarobaar, kisi sanstha yaa kisi pariyojna main rakam lagaana hota he to vahiin vinievesh kaa matlab us rakam ko waapas nikaalnaa hota he
 Explain that Air India has to pay a debt of Rs 9,000 crore in this financial year
 company ne is par sarkaar kii madad maangi he, lekin uske sweekaar kiye jane kii sambhaavna kam he
 The government wants to sell its 76 percent stake in the airline
 BSNL kaa bhi haal behalere india ke alaava telecom company beasenel main bhi selary sankat dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In the last February, there was a delay in getting salary to BSNL employees
 vahiin june main bhi karmchaariyon ko selary sankat kaa dar bana hua tha
 BSNL employees get salary till the last of every month or the first working day of the next month
 worldcup kaa final shanivaar dopaher dhai bajeshuru hoga or nateeja raat das baje tak hi aa paaegaa
 But the result of the World Cup finals has come before Team India has entered the field
 ji haa,team indiaworldacup jeet gai he
 But this is not the prediction of any astrology but the claim of the speculative market which had told it six weeks ago that this time the World Cup final will be between India and Sri Lanka
 tab worldcup kii pehali gend bhi nahin phenki gai thi
 On 19 February, the first match of the World Cup was to be played between India and Bangladesh
 par usase do din pehle histta bazaarne apana faisla suna diya tha
 The decision, of the world champion, of the two teams that reached the final
 faisla semi final main pahanchane vaali chaar tiimon kaa
 The decision of the players to score the most runs and take the most wickets in the World Cup
 or isi satta bazaar ke hawaale se ajtak ne 17 farvari ko hi bataaya tha ki worldcup final 2 april ko mumbai ke vankhede stadium main bharat or srilanka ke bich khelaa jayega
 India and Sri Lanka are really going to face each other in the finals in terms of speculative market claims and prices
 lihaaja ab sabaki najar isi satta bazaar kii aakhri baazi par ja tiki he
 Who will win the finals? Will the truth of the final about the final market prove the same way? There is good news for every Indian
 kyonki satta bazaar 17 farvari ke apane daawey par ab bhi kaayam he
 The claim is that on 2 April, this glittering trophy will not be in anyone else's hands but in the hands of Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 satta bazaarne worldcup kaa apana aakhri bhav bhi khol diya he
 This price is also in favor of India with 57 paise
 satta bazaar ne final kaa bhav kholaa he 57 paise bharat
 That is, those who think that the final will win Lanka, can play bets on Lanka above 57 paise
 to jo satta bazaar se sahamat naa hon or jinke paas final kaa sahi jawaab he bas samaj lijie world cap 2011 use maalamaal kar degaa
 This is the tenth World Cup and this is the first time Satta Bazaar has expressed such confidence in Team India
 ab ise dhoni ke dhurandharon kaa jalawaa kahie yaa haal ke vakt main team india kaa pradarshan
 The same betting market had told that on March 29, before the india-pakistan match, India would reach the final
 kul mila kar do nateezon ko chhod den to satta bazaar kaa har daanv is baar sateek baitha he
 Then the biggest match of the World Cup, ie india-pakistan semi-final did not start in Mohali
 match 30 march ko hona tha
 While Satta Bazar had announced on March 29 that Team India was reaching the final and on March 29, we had also conveyed this information to you
 vaise aisa bhi nahin he ki satta bazaar kaa is world cap main har daanv sahi baitha ho
 The teams of Australia and South Africa have also messed up his math
 satta bazaar ne world cap shuru hone se pehle hi bharat kaa shuruaati bhav kholaa tha teen rupee
 This was the lowest price among the 14 teams
 jis team kaa bhav sabase kam yani jeet kii wo sabase majboot daavedaar
 While the price of the neighboring Sri Lanka team opened at number two
 jiskaa satta bazaar main shuruaati bhav tha 4
 70 rupees
 bhartiya up mahadweep main pichhali baar world cap hua tha 1996 main, tab srilanka ne vishwa cap apane naam kiya tha
 Sri Lanka also reached the final in the 2007 World Cup
 satta bazaar kaa ganit yahaan tak to thik baitha
 But the South African team not only spoiled his math but also caused a lot of damage
 darasal world cap jeetna to dur, kabhi final main bhi nahin pahunchane vaali dakshin africa kii team paanch rupee ke bhav ke saath satorion kii teesri pasand thi
 The South African team also reached the semi-finals in 1992, 99 and 2007
 par chokar ke naam se mashhoor dakshin africa team is baar quarter final main naujiland se maat kha kar baahar ho gai or uski jagah newjiland semifinal main pahunch gai
 Australia's betting on the speculative market was also reversed
 england se ashes haarane ke baavjood 6-1 se vanade siries jeetne vaali australian team ko bhi satorie halke main nahin le rahe the
 a four-time World Champion and three consecutive World Cup wins to Ponting's team
 50 rupee ke bhav ke saath semifinal main pahunchane vaali chauthi team bataai gai thi
 But Satta Bazar says that the quarter-final lineup went awry due to upsets in group matches and Australia's loss to Pakistan
 isi ke chalate bharat or australia semifinal se pehle hi aamane-saamne aa gayi
 Otherwise Australia would have been in the semi-finals
 yani satta bazaar ke shuruaati bhav ke hisaab se bharat, srilanka, south africa or australia wo chaar timen thim jo semifinal main pahunchatin
 Of these, India and Sri Lanka have reached the finals but New Zealand and Pakistan have reached the semi-finals instead of South Africa and Australia
 yani semifinal ko lekar satta bazaar kaa daawa fifty-fifty sahi sabit hua
 While 100% about the finals
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki kya world cap champion ko lekar bhi uskaa daawa sau fisadi sach sabit hota he yaa nahin? zaahir he jo satta naa bhi khelte hon unki bhi yahi dua hogi ki satta bazaar kii bhavishyavaanee or daav final main sach sabit ho
 Because the matter is the cup that the whole of India is asking for
 11 khilaadi ke hisaab se 14 deshon ke kul 254 khilaadiyon ne world cap ke dauraan chah hafton tak apane johar dikhaae
 But Satta Bazaar's eyes were Sachin Tendulkar
 satta bazaar ne chah hafte pehle daawa kiya tha ki tendulkar world cap main sabase zyada ran banane vaale khilaadi honge or lagata he sachmuch aisa hi hone ja rahaa he
 Just think about that scene, Sachin Tendulkar scored his hundred in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday and after that Dhoni lifted the World Cup in his hands
 yakeenan world cap kaa isse behtareen or khubasurat anjaam kuch or ho hi nahin saktaa
 Both these things are possible
 kyonki tendulkar ab tak test or vanade main kul mila kar 99 shatak thonk chuke hai or team india world cap cap khitaab se sirf ek kadam dur he
 This is the only thing that has made the maximum silver in the speculative market
 team india ke cap jeetne par to satta bazaar ne pehle hi apana daav dhoni par khel diya he
 The right attitude has been fulfilled by Tendulkar, who is going to hit the hundredth century
 yani shanivaar ko satta bazaar kii chaandi hi chaandi he
 It is worth mentioning that even before the start of the World Cup, the Satta Bazaar had opened the prices of five top batsmen and five bowlers who performed the best in the World Cup
 hairaani karne vaali baat he ki satta bazaar ne tabhi ye kah diya tha ki tendulkar is world cap main sabase zyada ran banane vaale khilaadi honge
 That is why the price of Tendulkar was kept at two rupees
 sachin tendulkar ab tak world cap main do shatak or do ardhashatak ke saath 464 ran bana chuke hai
 While Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan has scored 467 runs
 yani sachin se sirf teen ran zyada
 Now these two players will face face to face in the final on Saturday
 donon hi apni-apni team ke liye opening karne aaenge
 That is, Sachin will have full chance to prove the truth of the speculation market
 dilashaan se aage nikal kar world cap main sabase zyada ran banane kaa
 Apparently, besides the title win on Saturday, the maximum bets and sentiments are going to be scored on Sachin Tendulkar's centuries
 ab jaraa sochie jo team india ke world cap jeetne or sachin ke saunve shatak par ek saath daav laga de or jeet jaae uski to jholii hi bhar jaaegi
 India and Pakistan clash in the semi-finals and then Team India in the final
 satta bazaar ke liye kamai kaa isse behatar or sunaharaa mauka koi hi nahin saktaa tha
 This is the reason that this World Cup has filled his bag more than expected
 maujuuda world cap par ab tak takreeban saath hajaar karod kaa daanv khelaa ja chukaa he? satta bazaar ke sutron kii maane to akele final match par kareeb 15 hajaar karod daanv par lag chuke hai
 Before the start of the World Cup, the betting market itself was expecting to put around fifty thousand crores at stake
 par group maichon main kai choti or kamjor tiimon ke chalate ye aankada puraa hota najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 Then he also suffered a lot as teams like South Africa and Australia were eliminated before the semi-finals
 magar phir bharat-pakistan ke bich semifinal jaisaa ahm match satta bazaar kii jholii main aa gira, or yaheen se uski takadir badal gai
 According to a estimate, on this one match of indo-pak alone, about twenty thousand crores of rupees were lost
 kul mila kar satta bazaar kii nigahen ab final par tiki hai
 As India is in the finals and also a win-win, Satta Bazaar is expecting rain of notes on all the 600 balls thrown in the final
 Thanks for all the concerns
 Everything is as good as it can be just a few broken bones

 Sensing the opportunity, through this incident, the Congress surrounded PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah fiercely
 congress ne ise piem or bijepi kii girti lokapriyata se jodate hue rajya or centre main sarkaar kii thap nitiyon kaa hawala diya
 In Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that this is not a simple protest, but a mass movement involving farmers
 singhvi ne kaha ki ek prakaar se ye ek nai kranti he, ek andolan he, ek jabardast baghawat he
 Look at their reasons in Gujarat, which is very serious

 More than 5000 farmers died during Modi era
 The Congress spokesperson said that Modi ji made this false propaganda, in the elections in place, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat that farmers would not commit suicide in Gujarat
 lekin ye aapako nahin bataaya ki aankade kuch or hi kahani sunaate hai
 The time period of about 11 years is from 2002 to 2012, in which more than five and a half thousand farmers have died
 ye sarkari aankade hai, inako chupaane kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Growth rate fell in BJP rule: Congress Singhvi said that today the number of farmers in Gujarat has reduced by about 3 and half lakhs
 agar aap krishi ke rup main aankade dekhen to badi dayaneey he
 From 2003 to 2008 there are many agricultural commodities that went to zero, not zero
 agar aap gramin inflation dekhen, kyonki ye sabhi is aakrosh ke kaaran hai
 The largest rural inflation in India is in Gujarat
 upie sarkaar ke dauraan 2013-2014 tak growth rate 4 pratishat thi
 But in the NDA government, the growth of agriculture in the national level in 2014-2015 is 0

 You have been in contact with a woman for the past several days, when you are with her, you feel strangely relaxed, even when you are away from them, you are lost in the thoughts of love
 or ab to aapane maan bhi liya he ki aap man hi man us ladki ko pasand karne lage hai
 You want to talk to him about his mind, but the problem is that you have not yet understood what is going on in his mind for you
 aap kai dinon se isi duvidha main hai ki kahin apane man kii baat kehane par aap dosti ke rishte se bhi haath na dho baithen, to janaab ab phikr chod den
 Only by their gestures and interactions can you find out what is going on in your mind about you
 jaaniye aisi baaten jinase aapako pataa chal sakate hai unke man ke halaat
 1- During the conversation, pay attention to which address she calls you
 agar aapkaa up naam aapke offis yaa dost ke bich khaasaa charchit he or vah bhi aapke is naam se avgat hai
 But even if she calls you by your name, she considers you more than a friend
 aapako upnaam se pukaar kar vah khud ko aapke doston kii list main shaamil karnaa nahin chaahatin or bhavishya main kabhi sochane kii sambhaavna bhi nahin he
 2- You work in the same office
 or aap is baat se acchhee tarah avgat hai ki vah apane honton par balm lagaati hai, lekin kabhi bhi vah aapke saamne aisa nahin karatin
 So sir, this is good news for you, because it means that they have deep feelings for you
 ek baat to tay he ki agar aapane unhen kabhi lipbaam lagaate hue dekha he or vah bahut sahajata se aapke saamne lipbaam laga leti hai, to unke liye kisi tarah kii manshaa paalane kii jarurat nahin he, vah aapako apana sahakarmi hi maanati hai
 3- When you look at them, she often turns her tongue on her lips
 ho saktaa he ki yah dekhne main sahaj lage, lekin yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki vah aapmen ruchi rakhti hai
 4- If your lover does not like to smoke, but still she talks to you while you are smoking, or does not leave you alone, then surely she also likes you
 5- vah akasar aapako kisi celibrity se miltajulata bataati hai, to iskaa matlab he ki vah aapako bahut hot maanati hai
 Former Team India captain Sunil Gavaskar says that if the action of a bowler is seen as suspicious, instead of reporting it to the ICC, the umpires should immediately remove it during the game or ask the concerned captain to remove it from the bowling attack
 needed
 gavaskar ne kaha ki aisa karne se gendbaaj match ke nattejey par prabhaav nahin daal paaegaa
 On the icc's tough stand against the suspected bowling action, Gavaskar said that the umpires need to inform the captain during the match instead of reporting after the match
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘sandigdh ection se apni team ko vanade main jeet dilaa dene ke baad gendbaaj kii report karne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 this is not right
 agar ve ection se naakhush hai to unhen captain ko use hataane ke liye kahana chahie
 It should be
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sandigdh ection kii report karne kii jagah ampiron ko sidhe captain ko bulaakar kahana chahie ki ve kisi nishchit gendbaaj ke ection se khush nahin hai or use match main aage gendbaaji kii sweekruti nahin milani chahie or agar vah gendbaaji karata he to uski report kii jaani chahie
 According to Gavaskar, there is no bowler in the Indian team whose action is questionable but in domestic cricket there are many players whose action needs improvement
 unhone kaha, ‘philhal bhartiya team main aisa koi khilaadi nahin he jiskaa ection sandigdh ho
 There are probably some bowlers in the domestic circuit who need to work on their action

 The partnership between Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi has been going on for a long time, when Sushil was a student at Patna Science College and Nitish was studying at Bihar College of Engineering

 Nitish successfully passed his electronics engineering exam and Sushil finished second in the university in botany

 "both started their political career in Patna as a student leader in Jayaprakash Narayan's entire revolution movement in 1974
 november 2005 main susheel nitish ke dipti ban gaye the or june 2013 tak bane rahe
 When the BJP started the campaign by making Narendra Modi the prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish ended his relationship with him
 lekin jab unhone bhaajapa kaa saath choda, tab bhi nitish ne susheel ke saath apane rishte prabhavit nahin hone die
 In February 2015, when he expelled Jeetan Ram Manjhi and returned as chief minister himself, he was warmly embraced at the swearing-in ceremony along with his former deputy Sushil
 unhone poocha tha, ''aise hi chalegaa?" ek baar phir, november 2015 main, jab unhone bihar main apni shandaar jeet ke baad shapath lee, to unhone susheel ko bataaya ki ve sarkaar main unki gaiyr-maujuudagi ko kitni shiddat se mahasoos karte hai
 So, when given a chance, Sushil made a secret plan to return Nitish to BJP
 ve vaise bhi lalu prasad yadav or unke parivaar ko (lekin nitish ko kabhi bhi nahin) nishaanaa bana kar rashtriya janata dal (rajd) or janata dal (united)-jad (you)-gathbandhan kii paraten ughaadte ja rahe the
 Sensing Nitish's growing disenchantment with the RJD, Sushil persuaded Narendra Modi and Amit Shah to bring him back
 susheel modi ne india today se kaha, ''ab jab hamane phir se shuruyaat kii he, to aisa lagata he, jaise ham kabhi alag hue hi nahin the
 Our alliance is natural, our governance style is in sync with each other and our working style — time-driven and goal-focused — is complementary to each other
 " iskaa asar dikh bhi rahaa he
 For example, a senior minister in the government says that cabinet meetings are now lively
 rajd ke saath unke gathbandhan ke antim kuch dinon main, nitish lagaataar kharaab mood main dikhte the
 a minister of the government said, "now Nitishji often smiles during cabinet meetings, and even jokes once or twice
 "aisa do dashakon main pehali baar hua he ki centre main or rajya main ek hi gathbandhan satta main he
 The last time this happened was in 1997, when Lalu ruled Bihar, and Inder Kumar Gujral was leading the Janata Dal government in New Delhi
 phir bhi ab rajya kii gati badal gai he
 During his previous alliance with the BJP, Nitish clearly had an edge in both governance and politics
 rajyasabha kii siton main bada hissaa (chah main se chaar) lene se lekar or loksabhaa main or vidhansabha main zyada siton par chunaav ladgaye tak, (2010 main 141 siton par) kaman nitish ke haath main hoti thi
 How are you now? 
 
 is samay, rajya main shashan ke maamle main bhale hi ab bhi nitish kii chalati ho—prashasan or grih vibhaag ab bhi unke hi adheen hai, or mukhyamantri kaa iees tathaa ipies afasaron par sidhaa niyantran he—lekin jahaan tak tak gathbandhan ke liye rajnatik faisle lene kaa maamla aata he, modi-shah ke netritv vaali bhaajapa zyada mukhar ho gai he
 This is also made clear by the structure of the new state cabinet
 mantrimandal main mukhyamantri ko milakar kul 29 sadsy hai
 The JD (U) has a large share and has 15 ministers, while the BJP has 13 ministers, one more than the RJD ministers in the previous government
 ek mantri lojpa ke hai
 When the JD (U) and the BJP formed a coalition government in the state for the last time in 2010, only 11 BJP ministers were in the government at the time when its 91 mlas won, while this time it has 53 mlas
 usase bhi pehle 2005-10 ke dauraan jad(you)-bhaajapa kii pehali gathbandhan sarkaar main bhaajapa ke paas 55 vidhayakon ke rahete bhi saat hi mantri sarkaar main the
 It is clear that the bjp's presence in the cabinet has steadily increased over the years
 jahaan tak loksabhaa chunaavon kii baat he, jab jad(you) or bhaajapa ne pichhali baar 2009 main milakar chunaav ladaa tha to jad(you) ne 25 ummidavaar maidan main utaare the or bhaajapa ne 15
 But in 2014, the situation completely reversed
 ab bhaajapa ke paas bihar se 22 loksabhaa sadsy hai or nitish ke paas keval do
 It is clear that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP will be more intrusive in seat sharing
 darasal, pichley hakrate jab party adhyaksh amit shah ne bihar bhaajapa kii kor team ke sadasyon kii baithak bulaai thi to unhone aakraamak tareeke se abhiyaan chhedgaye or booth str tak party ko majboot karne ke liye kaha tha taaki vah apane boote par sabhi 40 loksabhaa siten jeet sake
 This was seen as a step that pushed Nitish to the margins
 haalanki susheel modi ne nitish kumaar ko aashwast karne kii koshish ke taur par yah twit kiya ki kor group kii baithak main siton ke bantwaare par koi charchaa nahin hui thi
 There are more challenges, as Sushil Modi himself says, "the biggest challenge is the expectation of the people

 Sushil Modi says that now is the time to take a "quantum leap forward" because people will not be satisfied with just a little improvement

 a police officer said that the Chief Minister compared the crime figures of this January to August with the crime figures of the same period last year and asked questions directly to the police officers

 "but it is still early for Nitish and Sushil," says an IAS officer in Patna
 abhi unhen do hi maheene hue hai
 This is a short period of time to bring about any major change, especially when he had to cope with the flood situation and the creation scam as soon as he took over
 lekin jis eemaandaaree se donon kaam karte hai or shashan main jo jaankaree susheel modi rakhte hai, usase yakeenan unke netritv main rajya ko sarthak disha milegi
 "for example, Sushil Modi instructed all the principal secretaries, commissioners and district magistrates before the Bhagalpur-based NGO Mahila Sahyog Samiti ordered a CBI inquiry into the government scam worth Rs 1,300 crore
 They should update all government accounts immediately and their accounts should be sent to the Finance Department every month

 The said IAS officer said, "what a difference the Nitish government has made due to Sushil Modi, this can only be understood when we see it in the backdrop of the government being run by Nitish with the help of Lalu's RJD
" 
 nitish or lalu kabhi ek raay nahin hote the
 Contrary to Nitish's emphasis on rules and hygiene, Lalu was the one who immediately came to mind

 In fact, the Civil Surgeon of Darbhanga had even written a letter quoting Lalu's oral order to reinstate some contract workers

 "A district magistrate says," The compulsion of coalition politics kept Nitish silent for a long time but he was never comfortable with Lalu Yadav
 sarkaar main susheel modi ke shaamil hone se shashan main ek vyavastha aa gai he
 "this assessment was also confirmed by a JD (U) leader, with the end of alliances with the Shirajad, now governance will be more systematic

 Had there been any other country in the world, everyone's lungs would have been examined

 acha hota supreme court iske liye bhi kisi ko nijee taur par jimmedaar tehraata jis tarah se paraali jalaane ke maamle main gram pradhan ko nijee taur par jimmedaar tehraaya he
 i wish a privately responsible environment minister and secretary would also be appointed

 Does the lung occur only in the people of Delhi? Is the wind bad only because of stubble? hamase ek shaks milane aae the
 Mirza Arif

 When the rubber of the tire is rubbed and goes into the lungs through the breath, it pits there

 The Supreme Court said that the wind is bad
 jeene ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 Then the court should order that governments should return the money of air purifier to every citizen who was forced to buy
 sarkaar kii naakaami ke kaaran hi logon ko das se tees hazaar ke air purifaire kharidne pade hai
 The court demanded that how many hundred crore air purifiers have been sold in Delhi only in the first week of November
