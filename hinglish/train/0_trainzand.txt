 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki unki samaj ke anusaar himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke khilaaf pehle hi do aaropon kii jaanch sibiai kar rahi he
 Jaitley said that this is the third charge against Singh related to any power company which needs to be investigated

 This company had a transaction with the Himachal government

 Jaitley says that the first charge against Singh is in the name of 'VBS' which was found in the diary of a steel making company and which is being investigated by CBI
 unhone kaha ki doosraa aarope shimla kii ek bank ke khate main 5
 5 crore is linked to the deposit and transfer of it by a person named Anand Chauhan for the benefit of LIC policies of VB Singh and his family

 chunaav ayog kii ore se ayogy qaraar die gaye 20 vidhayakon kii ore se hoicourt main sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha gaya ki ayog ne hamaara paksh sune bagaiyr hi ayogy qaraar de diya
 In the matter of the post of profit, the counsel for AAP mlas on Monday said in the High Court that the recommendation of Election Commission is illegal
 bahes ke dauraan aap ke vidhayakon kaa tark tha ki chunaav ayog ne 23 june, 2017 ko unke muvvakil ko bharosa diya tha ki maamle main antim bahes shuru hogi or isaki taarikh unhen bataai jaaegi, lekin iske baad unhen na to bulaayaa gaya or na hi faisle kii taarikh di gayi sidhe 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In front of the double bench of Justice Sanjeev Khanna and Justice Chandrasekhar, the counsel for the mlas said that without allowing the mlas to stand, the commission held their client guilty of the post of profit and sent their recommendation to the President
 chunaav ayog ne jo kuch kiya wo nyaay ke prakritik siddhanton kaa sidhe taur par hanan he
 Counsel further stated that the Election Commission's decision is not only unfair and illegal but it is unfortunate that the Commission did not impartially decide on it

 " Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav is angry these days
 har raajnneetik vyakti in dinon isi sawaal kaa jawaab khoj rahaa hai ki 'netaji' ko gussa kyon aata he
 Currently, his sons are angry with his son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 akhilesh yadav se mulaayam singh yadav kaa sambandh khatta-meetha he
 Expectation is a matter of living up to it
 aap kah sakate hai ki ghar kii baat he
 But why Mulayam is angry with Nitish
 jis nitish kumaar par jithan ram maanjhi ko hataakar mukhyamantri banane kaa dabaab daalane main sabase zyada prabhavi bhoomika mulaayam singh yadav ne nibhaai, jis nitish kumaar ko kuch maah purv bihar main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane main kuch ghanton main aam sahmati banaakar sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan karne vaale mulaayam aajkal unheen nitish se khafa kyon hai? So far, Mulayam Singh Yadav has spoken in his heart with his supporters and Lalu Yadav, Sharad Yadav, in addition to being ignored in the coordination of seats, the increasing proximity to Congress is the main reason
 isse bhi zyada mulaayam aravind kejariwal ke saath nitish kumaar kii saarvajanik manch par badhati najdiki ko bhi pasand nahin kiya
 More than that, Mulayam also expressed his displeasure at giving 40 seats to the Congress party in Bihar and calling Congress President Sonia Gandhi in the Swabhiman rally
 mulaayam ke samarthak bhi maanate hai ki paryaapt siten na milanaa ek bahaanaa he, kyonki nitish kumaar ne na keval unhen mahagathbandhan kaa adhyaksh balki sansadeey daal kaa bhi adhyaksh ghoshit kiya tha
 Even today, Lalu Yadav publicly stated that if Netaji is ready, then he is ready to contest 200 seats on the cycle symbol, but everyone knows that Mulayam hardly takes a flexible approach in this matter
 samaajawaadee party kii bihar ikai ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki mahagathbandhan se ladane main bhale hi shaayad kuch ummidavaaron ke vidhayak banane kii sambhaavna thi lekin ab sabhi siton par ladane main shaayad hi koi guarantee de
 The key to the party will be of Votkatwa, and this time in the electoral atmosphere in Bihar, hardly anyone can vote for Votkatwa
 tippaniyan The real question is why did Mulayam leave Bihar's Grand Alliance in the limelight and why are his views so hot? If the Rashtriya Janata Dal's leaders are to be believed, then the BJP is blackmailing some big leaders of the Samajwadi Party on the basis of evidence in some old and new cases
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki sibiai ne lalu yadav ke khilaaf chaara ghotaale ke ek maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay main jis prakaar se apil daayar kii usase saaf hai ki lalu yadav ko bhi yah dar dikhaaya gaya
 Although Lalu Yadav had made it clear at the Swabhimaan rally that if the CBI can arrest him, he has no fear
 ant main sawaal he ki is uthapatak kaa aakhir kya hashr hoga
 a few months ago, Samajwadi Party's Rajya Sabha leader Ram Gopal Yadav and Nitish Kumar were debating the merger issue
 ramgopal yadav ne nitish kumaar ko salaah di ki aap or lalu yadav apni partiyon kaa vilay kar chunaav lard jaaen, lekin tab nitish kumaar ne tark diya tha ki agar bihar main ham log milakar bijepi ko roak nahin paae to aap kalpana bhi mat kijiega ki aap 2017 main uttar pradesh bachaa sakate hai

 Mulayam's supporters also believe that not getting enough seats is an excuse, as Nitish Kumar declared him not only the president of the grand alliance but also the president of the parliamentary pulses
 aaj bhi lalu yadav ne saarvajanik rup se kaha ki agar netaji taiyaar ho jaaen to cycle chunaav chinh par 200 siton par ladane ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin sabhi jaanate hai ki mulaayam ab is maamle main shaayad hi lacheela rukh apanaaen
 The leaders of Samajwadi Party's Bihar unit also believe that even though some candidates were likely to become mlas in fighting the Grand Alliance, there is hardly any guarantee in fighting all the seats now
 party kii chaabi votakatwa kii hogi or is baar bihar main jo chunavi maahaul he usamen shaayad hi koi votakatwa ko vot de
 The comments asal sawaal yah he ki aakhir mulaayam bihar ke mahagathbandhan ko majdhaar main chhodkar kyon chale gaye or unke tevar itane garam kyon hai? agar rashtriya janata daal ke netaaon kii maane to bijepi kuch puraane or nae mukademon main saakshyon ke aadhaar par samaajawaadee party ke kuch bade netaaon ko blackmel kar rahi he
 These leaders say that the way the CBI filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against Lalu Yadav in a fodder scam case, it is clear that Lalu Yadav was shown this fear
 haalanki lalu yadav ne swabhimaan raily main saaf kiya tha ki unhen sibiai chaahe to giraftaar kar sakati he, unhen koi dar nahin he
 In the end, the question is, what will be the fate of this hoax
 kuch mahine pehle samaajawaadee party ke rajya sabha main netaa ramgopal yadav or nitish kumaar main vilay ke mudde par bahes ho rahi thi
 Ramgopal Yadav advised Nitish Kumar that you and Lalu Yadav should merge their parties to contest elections, but then Nitish Kumar argued that if we together in Bihar could not stop the BJP, then you would not even imagine that you May save Uttar Pradesh in 2017

 Last time, just before the Rajya Sabha elections, he started seeing friends in Lalu Yadav, which had the advantage that he got the seat of Rajya Sabha for the second time

 saal 2016 auskar samaaroh priyanka chopra ke liye yaadgaar hoga
 Ever since Priyanka's name has been released in the list of Oscar presenters at the Academy Awards, the same tension has been persecuted as to what to wear when wearing a special occasion like Oscar! It is a matter of great pride for any actor to be a presenter at the Oscars and every name decides the panel of the Academy after a lot of thought
 duniyabar ke antertenment jagat se bade-bade naamon se kuch lucky shakhsiyaton ko yah mauka miltaa he or 2016 main yah mauka priyanka chopra ke haath laga or jaahir he aise maukey par sab kii nazar rahegi ki desi girl kya pahanengi? kya bhartiya libaas hogi priyanka kii chois yaa phir videshi dress? Priyanka is still under pressure that for the first time in an event like Oscar, an Indian has got this opportunity, so Priyanka should wear a desi dress
 vahiin priyanka kaa kahana he ki vah bhartiya hai or bharat se bahut pyaar karti hai, lekin dress or is par muhar lagane ke liye unhen koi libaas pahanakar sabit karne kii zarurat nahin he
 'I am an Indian
 
 
 mere khun main bharat he
 
 
 But my patriotism should not be judged by wearing a dress or not
 
 This Oscar opportunity is a squeeze of my work till date and reflects Indianness in that work
 
 
 to usase kapadon se sabit karne kii yaa thappa lagane kii zarurat nahin
 Comments priyanka ke personal stylist unki auskar luk par kaam shuru kar chuke hai
 'whatever i will wear, people will say something, but i never read the difference from these things
 mere stylist international diziners se baat kar rahe hai or mere liye parfect outfit dizine karenge
 i do not give any designer briefs
 meri team mere saath lambe samay se kaam kar rahi he or jaanati he meraa style kya he
 What i like aakhir main main hi faisla luungi ki main kya pahanuungi
 
 ' Priyanka says that she gives creative inputs to her designer and is also giving on this occasion, 'I know what i want
 
 Which dress would suit me? 
 What do i want to look like? 
 Who knows my choice better than me

 'obisi trimurti seen se baharmaharashtra main bijepi ke teen pramukh obisi netaa gopinath munde, ekanath khadse or vinod taavade maane jate the, jo obisi ke vot ko lekar party main aae the
 These three OBC leaders are out of the scene in the assembly elections this time for different reasons
 yahi vajah he ki khud hi amit shah ne obisi ko saadhe rakhane kii kavayad shuru kii he
 OBC leader Nitin Chaudhary in Maharashtra said that they are not all on one platform due to lack of a strong network in different communities of the OBC class, most of the leaders are based only on their castes
 lekin badale hue raajnneetik maahaul main obisi kaa bijepi main bhale hi koi cheharaa na ho, lekin voter or kaaryakarta bijepi ke saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 The obcs in Maharashtra state that the obcs in Maharashtra are divided into about 356 castes and they get 19 per cent reservation

 ab notebandi ke faisle ko 6 maheene se adhik samay biit chukaa he, lekin kendra sarkaar samet bhartiya rigerv bank ke paas antim aankade nahin hai ki bainkon ne abhi tak kul kitni puraani karency jamaa kii he
 15 after restricting the old 1000 and 500 rupee currency according to the latest figures of the Reserve Bank
 4 lakh karod rupee kii karency kaa sanchaar kar liya gaya he
 There were a total of 17 in the country before demonetisation
 7 lakh karod kii karency sanchaar main thi
 Appearing for the second time before the Parliamentary Committee on Demonetization this week, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel told that the work of counting of old currency is still going on
 iske chalate abhi tak rigerv bank ke paas jamaa kii ja chuki karency kaa aankada nahin he
 At the same time, Patel claimed that he will be done counting the old currency by September, after which only the appropriate figures can be released
 ise bhi padhein: kya notebandi kaa sabase bada jhooth puraani karency kii ginati main chipa he?gauratlab he ki rigerv bank ko vaarshik hisaab-kitaab kii cloging 30 june ko kerani hoti he
 After this, by the middle of July, he releases his annual report and keeps the entire account of the year in front of the country
 lekin is baar urjit patel kaa sansadeey samiti ke saamne die bayaan ke baad ummid he ki rigerv bank july main jari hone vaali apni vaarshik report ko aadhi-adhuri pesh karne kii taiyaari main hai
 Due to this, the complete demonetization figures will not be present in this report
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya rigerv bank sirf aankadon ko chhipaane ke liye puraani karency kii ginati puri na hone kii baat kah rahi he
 This is also possible because: 1
 rigerv bank desh main bainkon ke paas maujuud kul karency kaa hisaab-kitaab cash rigerv reshio (siaraar) ke aadhaar par rakhata he
 According to the RBI rules, any bank can have cash only on the basis of CRR
 aisi sthiti main kya notebandi ke baad rigerv bank ne siaraar ke hisaab-kitaab ko puraa nahin kiya or bainkon ke paas paisa bina siaraar ke aadhaar par rakhaa he?2
 According to the Reserve Bank's rules, from the currency kept in its currency chest to the currency of the currency, pie-pie is calculated
 is puri prakriya main ek karency note kii jaanch or ginati kai baar kii jaati he or rigerv bank ke hisaab-kitaab ke saath-saath bainkon ke bahi-khate main aankade darj kiye jate hai
 After the demonetisation, has the Reserve Bank done the work of withdrawing money from currency chests and depositing money in bank accounts without counting and checking? Read also: GST reverse demonetisation, Modi's cashless India will come out? 3
 notebandi kaa elaan karne ke baad rigerv bank ne deshbhar main sanchaar vyavastha ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye kai asthai karency chest sthapit kii thi
 After temporary demonetisation, these temporary currency chests played an important role in converting about 86 percent of the country's currency to new currency
 lekin ab karency ginaney kii baat par kya rigerv bank kah rahi he ki uske asthai karency chest main puraane noton ko rakhane kaa kaam bina kisi ginati ke kiya gaya
 So, one thing is clear from these things that neither the demonetization figures will be included in the annual report of the Reserve Bank in July and the Reserve Bank will prepare its half-baked report because it claims that the counting of old notes will continue till September

 ’ Film Name: Meri Nirmon Director: Rahul Sankalyastar Cast: Anjali Patil, Master Karan Daemwratting: 3 Duration: 1 hour 30 mins Rahul Sankalya, who worked with Anand l Rai in Wannu Weds Manu, brings a small town story under his direction
 aaie samiksha main jaanate hai kisi bani he film or kya he isaki kahani
 
 
 What is the story of the film? My Nimmo story is from a small town in Madhya Pradesh
 jahaan nimmo yani anjali patil apane apane parivaar ke saath rahati hai
 Nimmo's entire family in which his aunt lives in a separate house

 He also has two younger sisters in Nimmo's house
 nimmo kii mausi kaa ek betaa jisaki umr aath saal he
 She falls in love with Nimmo, her sister
 lekin ye baat wo kah nahin paata
 Meanwhile Nimmo's marriage is decided

 The story moves forward
 shaadi ke saare reeti rivaaj shuru ho jate hai
 Nimmo takes care of the child, bathing and washing

 How does the innocent love of a small child grow slowly, does Nimmo get married, what does Nimmo's family say, what are the twists and turns of the story and what is the end of the story? Has been done in Avengers Infinity War Review: saare superhiroj aae ekasaath, damdaar kahaniakhir kyon dekh sakate he filmjaisa kii nimmo kii kahani ek chote kasbe kii kahani he
 Because of this, many people will definitely relate themselves in this story

 They feel that they are made only for them and should get married

 An attempt was made to show all these things in the film trailer as well

 The cinematography of the film is also excellent and the location is good
 kahani main moulikta dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 How things are done in a town
 kisi kasbe kii mitti kii khushboo is kahani main najar aati he
 Madhya Pradesh has a special tone
 rahul ne apni film main use dikhaane ke liye koi kasar nahin choda he
 The way the actors have done well in the film is amazing
 khaskar anjali patil kaa kirdaar
 Earlier, he also showed his strong acting in Newton

 The film is produced by Anand L
 Rai

 For the story of a town, this film must be seen
 review:biond da clouds kii kahani bedam, ishan kii acting bhi ausatkamjor kadiyanis film main koi bhi masala nahin he
 There is no beating, action or sabotage
 masaaledaar commercial filmon kii talash karne waalon ko isse niraashaa haath lagegi
 The film also lacks a big star cast
 agar bade sitaron kii film dekhne ke aadi hai to ye film aapke liye nahin he

 Let me tell you that Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit will be seen sharing the screen for the first time from this film after the 1997 film Mahanati
 sanjay dutt kaa khulaasa- maa kii maut par 3 saal baad foot-footkar royaa thafilm main in donon kalakaar ke alaava aalia bhatta, varun dhawan, sonakshi sinha or aditya roy kapur bhi hai
 The film is being produced under the banner of Dharma Productions
 us banquet haul main shaadi kii party chal rahi thi
 For the sake of the guests, one dancer was also invited along with a delicious meal
 har koi thirak rahaa tha
 a camera was also capturing this memorable moment forever
 lekin tabhi achaanak stage ke neeche se ek goli chalati he
 Absolutely live
 phir maut aati he
 That too live
 lekin ye vaardaat aksar khushiyon ke maukey par hone vaali firing or usase hone vaali mauton se zaraa hat kar he
 Because this death is not just accident, but the reason behind it is anger
 khushi ke maukey parmout ke saamaan kii kya jarurat? aakhir kyon log apni khushiyon kaa izhaar goliyaan chalaa kar karte hai? aakhir khushi ke izhaar ke hajaar duusare tareeke maujuud hai
 But people understand then
 vaise bhi sirf bathinda main hijashn matam main tabdeelanhin hua he
 There are no such examples
 dilli kii jesica laal to yaad hogi aapako, jise ek raiszade ko faqat ek paig nahin dene kii qeemat apni jaan dekar chukaani padi thi
 17 years have passed since that incident
 tab mehfil main goli chali thi
 After that such incidents kept happening
 bathinda ke maud mandi ilaake ke ek banquet haul main shaadi kaa function tha
 Dance was going on the stage
 dance group kii ladkiyaan thirak rahi thim
 While under the stage all the Baratis and other guests were jogging
 rang birangi raushnee or peeche lagi badi si screen par pal-pal ubhartee tasviren maahaul ko or khushnuma bana rahi thim
 when all of a sudden
 bheed ke bich se ek rifl hawa main laharaati he
 Then before someone could understand something, the sound of firing in the festival echoed
 isi ke saath stage par dancer kulwinder cor zamin par gir padati he
 The bullet fired from the rifle appears directly in Kulwinder's head
 isse pehle ki koi kuch samaj paata wo vahiin stage par girte hue pehle baithti he or puri tarah gir jaati he
 All this happens so quickly that even the people standing around do not realize that someone has just been shot
 yahaan tak ki dancer ko goli lagane ke chand second baad tak bhi kuch log vahaan thirak rahe hai
 But then as soon as people fall on the ground, Kulwinder falls, everyone's senses fly away
 puure marij haul main sannata pasar jaataa he
 People start shouting and screaming
 mehfil main machi is afaraatafari kaa phayda uthaa kar goli chalaanevaala shaks rifl samet mauka e vaardaat se bhaag nikalataa he
 But the saying is not over yet
 vahashipan abhi baaki thi
 The dancer who was shot, does not know how much life was left in him
 bachi thi bhi yaa nahin
 But the way he is lifted from the stage
 uthaaya kya ghasita jaataa he wo kam se insaaniyat ko sharmanda karne vaali tasviir thi
 But how did the shoot take place in the marriage ceremony? Who was the dying dancer? Who was the one who shot? Why did he shoot the dancer? Was it just an accident? Or is the story something else? The dancer was dancing on stage a few seconds from now
 vahi dancer ab ek laash ban chuki thi
 His lifeless body was lying on the same stage
 lekin iske baad shaadi ke aayojan se jude logon ne jo kuch kiya, wo to insaaniyat ko hi sharmasaar kar gaya
 After firing, the murderer had escaped after taking advantage of the chaos
 ek to bhari mehfil main stage ke upar firing se dancer kii maut
 After death from above, people say this dancer or like this sit with the dead body of the dancer
 vahaan goli lagane ke baad stage se ek dancer kii laash ko yun ghaseet kar uthaa le jane se in logon kaa dil ek baar bhi nahin pasija
 Some organizers hang Kulwinder Keelash with hands and feet immediately after being shot, something that no one does with animals
 ghaseetne kii vajah se kulwinder kaa bejaan jism zamin par ghist rahaa he
 The head is hitting the stairs
 sir se nikali koon kii dhar lagaataar zamin ko laal kar rahi he
 People carrying the corpse from above are also abusing
 mauka-e-vaardaatse kaatil faraar ho chukaa he
 The bjp's Rajasthan unit, which claims Shuchita's politics, has made mlas who came out of jail on bail as ministers
 saat dinon kii maathapai ke baad aakhirkaar daagi vidhayakon ko mantri banane par party main sahmati ban gai
 After this, 12 mlas, including two tainted, were included in Vasundhara Raje's cabinet, out of which 9 were made cabinet ministers
 lekin sawaal yahi he ki agar jamaanat radd hui to in mantriyon kaa kya hoga
 At the same time, due to tainted ministers, the Congress was often stuck, now showing the mirror to the BJP
 vasundhara ke chahete rathod bane mantriin mantriyon main pehla naam he rajendra rathod kaa
 He has been known many times in Central Jail Jaipur
 unhen sibiai ne apane chargeshit main daaria singh farji encounter kaa mukhya sajeeshkarta banaaya he
 But these are considered to be the most loved of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 lihaaja saaf-suthri sarkaar ke vaade ko 'chahetavaad' ke aage bhula diya gaya
 However, Rajendra Rathore is calling the allegations against himself a conspiracy by the Congress government
 farji encounter main aaropee kataaria bhi cabinet meniske alaava rajasthan bijepi main number do or aresas kaa cheharaa maane-jane vaale gulabchand kataaria bhi soharabuddin farji encounter maamle main agrim jamaanat par baahar hai
 He has been accused by the CBI of conspiring in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter while being the Home Minister of Rajasthan in the previous government
 lekin kataaria kehete hai ki vah nirdosh sabit hokar aaenge
 He said, 'there is nothing in the case
 mujhe agrim jamaanat mili he or aaj tak chal rahi he
 Secondly i have imposed Section 227 that the charge sheet which was presented is wrong
 'mantrimandal main jati kaa santulanamderna se lekar babulal nagar ke itihaas vaali congress ab vasundhara sarkaar ke daaman par daag dekhakar naak-bhun sikod rahi he
 Party spokesperson Archana Sharma attacked the BJP in this regard
 iske alaava jatigat sameekaran main santulan banane ke liye mantrimandal main zyaadaatar jatiyon ke netaaon ko jagah dene kii koshish kii gai he
 The rest has been told that the one who wins the party with more votes in his Lok Sabha elections will get a place in the next cabinet expansion
 haalanki soobe kii mahila mukhyamantri ne kisi bhi mahila ko mantri nahin banaaya he

 dakshin africa ke anbhavi ballebaaj hashim amala ne kaha ki bharat-dakshin africa international vanade cricket siries ke aakhri match main team ke chotil tej gendbaaj morne morkal kaa khel paanaa mushkil he
 Fast bowler Morne Morkalbharat, who could not play in the last match - South Africa batsman Hashim Amla said about the South Africa International ODI Cricket Series at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium said, "I don't think Morne will be fit to play on Sunday
" usne net par kuch gendbaaji kii he or ham ravivaar aakhri faisla lenge, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki morkal khilne ke liye thik ho paaegaa
 Despite a leg injury on the day of the third ODI in Rajkot, Morkel bowled brilliantly, scoring 39 runs and taking four wickets to bowl a fine innings
 dakshin africa team main khilaadiyon kii kamidakshin africa ke tej gendbaaj morne morkelachennai ke chauthe vanade match main chot kii vajah se nahin khel paae, is match main bharat ne 35 ran se jeet hasil karke paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa 2-2 se baraabar kar di
 Amla also said that due to a hand injury at Rajkot, he was ruled out of the last two matches, with the injury of all-rounder Jean Pal Duminy affecting the balance of the team
 unhone chintaa jataate hue kaha ki, 15 khilaadiyon kii majboot team main sirf 11 khilaadiyon ke sahare badi siries nahin jeetna mushkil he
 input language maharashtra kii gramin vikaas mantri pankaja munde ke chappal unke ek karmchaaree ke haath main dikhne ke baad vah phir se vivaadon main ghir gai hai
 Pankaja recently visited the drought-hit areas of the state, during which the incident took place
 vipakshi dal congress ne is maukey parpankajapar chutki lete hue kaha ki yah unki manovriti ko darshata he
 While defending himself, he said that the person carrying his slippers was not a government employee but his personal employee
 pradesh ke parabhaani jile ke sonpeth ke daure parpankajane aage phislan bhari sadak dekhakar apni chappal utaar di thi
 She moved forward barefoot while someone behind raised her slippers
 pankajane buudhvaar shaam ko kaha ki media ne dekha ki maine chappal utaari, or kisi ne unhen uthaaya
 But the media did not see how much trouble i had in walking barefoot? Seeing the slippery road, i took off my slippers as usual and went ahead
 mujhe to pataa bhi nahin tha ki kisi ne mere chappal uthaae hai
 i came to know about this later
 unhone kaha, vah vyakti meraa nijee karmchaaree he
 There is no government employee
 asli khabar sookhaa or kisaanon kii haalat he
 Congress spokesperson al-nasir Zakaria said the incident had blown Pankaja's claims that he felt the pain of the poor
 -input bhashaa Devdas Apteji must have been 24 years old when Nanaji Deshmukh took him to Guwahati from awadh-tirhut mail in 1963
 50 ghante kii yatra tay kar guwahati pahunchane vaale apte ji ke paas assam main koi sampark nahin tha
 Whomever you met for the first time and wherever you went, they went for the first time with their efforts
 19 may ko jab assam main bijepi kii aitihaasik jeet kaa jashn manaya ja rahaa tha tab maine assi saal ke apte ji ko phone kiya
 The first time i was hesitant to talk but started talking on the basis of general introduction
 apte ji rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke un prachaarkon main se ek hai jo assam gaye
 The celebration of bjp's victory did not come in their way
 apte ji nirvikaar dhang se bataane lage
 Said that sometime let's talk
 puraani peedi ke sangh ke logon ke aacharan se shikaayat nahin milegi
 After the year of 2014, these people seem completely different from the way BJP leaders have recognized the vulgar and undemocratic language on social media as the restlessness of the youth
 haal hi main rajya sabha sadsy swapan dasgupta ne times aaf india ke apane ravivaariya kollam main trol yani gaali galouj kii bhashaa ko jaij tehraaya
 Jaitley, who was jailed against the Emergency in his youth, while talking to NDTV said that ignore or troll the troll
 aap soshal media par gaali dene waalon kii profile dekhie
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist explains, uses the symbols of the organization and abuses the mother-sister
 kisi ke khilaaf anaap shanaap afvaahen failaate hai
 Today, the advice to digest and accept this is being given
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh samskruti kii baat karata he lekin uski vichaardhaara main paley yah netaa kaise is apsamskruti ko manyata dete hai
 How can the union remain silent
 yahaan tak ki bhashaai aakraamakata bhaajapa ke pravaktaaon main bhi dikhti he
 The spokesmen who used to call me bold and independent journalist before 2014 also do not speak properly
 jab mujhe dalal se lekar meri maa tak ko gaaliyaan di gayi tab bhi yah log chup rahe
 i was praised by Arun Jaitley for reporting Bihar elections in 2005 and Sushil Modi came to the Patna office
 is chunaav main main susheel modi tak se nahin mil sakaa jabaki puri duniya unka intervyuu karke chali gai
 Whether i was afraid of Kiran Bedi's interview or Sushil ji fell victim to bitterness, i do not know
 na hi mujhe ab jaananaa he
 There was a time when big leaders like Prakash Javadekar used to take time for my program in the midst of all their engagements
 tarif karte the or puri sanjigdi se sakht sawaalon ke jawaab dete the
 Javadekar sahib used to call Ravish with affection
 tab upie kii sarkaar hua karti thi
 Then there was Sheila Dixit's government in Delhi, whose claims i had proved hollow in Ravish's report
 tab mere sho main aane ke liye aaj ke kai pravaktaa massej karte the ki, bahut dinon se aapane bulaayaa nahin he
 i am not writing to call or come
 vaise aa bhi nahin rahe hai
 i do not want to roam among the powerful people of Latin Delhi
 kabhi nahin rahi
 Apparently, the spokespersons are taking care of the social media bluffs which are abusing some journalists day and night in the shape of an army
 barkhaa dutt ko randi kaha gaya he or mujhe 100 fisadi randi kii aulad
 Thankfully these days i am not doing prime time with any political spokesperson, otherwise i used to return home every day in response to such behavior by getting excited or hurt
 is tarah kii aakraamak raajnneetik style ke bich sangh ke puraane prachaarak kaise sahaj rahete honge, yah kahana mushkil he, jab tak unki is apsamskruti ko lekar koi saarvajanik aalochana nahin aa jaati
 There is definitely an intention to question Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat directly on these questions
 agar unhone bhi nahin bulaayaa to koi baat nahin
 i have an old habit of being rejected
 mohan bhagwat ji ko ek din saarvajanik patr likhuunga
 i am sure that they will take action against this degeneration and show courage to separate such hoodlings from themselves
 main to apane str par aisa hone kaa prayaas karuunga hi! ziddee aadmi hum, haar jaaoongaa magar lard jaaoongaa, vah bhi akelaa
 Why did i write this while writing about Apteji? isliye ki is daur main bahut dinon baad shishtachar se mulaakaat hui
 Also say obedience
 mithe-mithe bol rahe the
 On calling for the first time, i started answering my question without any question
 unhone thik se suna yaa nahin lekin maine kaha ki main sangh kaa aalochak hum
 Still they were being talked about
 'assam main tab koi nahin jaanata tha, noujvaan tha
 Talked to people one by one
 praja socialist party ke ek vidhayak hue the madhusudan das
 He was a rural and peasant leader
 unase baat karte-karte raajnneetik sampark badhaayaa
 Then questions of infiltration started in Assam
 iske liye main shilong gaya, tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 'they brought census reports from the capital of Shillong
 madhusudan ji ko samajhaayaa or pehali baar assam main ghuspaith ke khilaaf ek cameti bani
 Told the wonderful story
 na kot karne vaali baaten bhi bataayin! i got lost in an invisible fantasy
 aaj assam kii kamyaabi kaa shrey lene waalon kii hode he lekin jo vyakti 24 saal kii umr main nagpur se assam gaya ho use kaisaa lag rahaa hoga
 His voice on the phone did not even indicate that he had a claim on this victory
 koi sethi the, jo media main shrey le rahe the soshal media prabandhan or ranneeti kaa
 i laughed
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie
 Seeing in the video, Shankar Das ji was talking
 karyaalay main koi rang gulaal nahin, koi tamaasha nahin
 It felt as if neither worked for it nor the power that came from it
 najadik jane par sangh ke puraane log dhang se baat karte hai
 Also talk to me and do not abuse
 tabhi to ek bade prachaarak ne phone nahin kaata
 The introduction did not say that you are against me
 soshal media par sanghee hone kaa daawa karne waalon kii tarah maa-bahan kii gaali nahin di
 i feel that this abuse is such a reality now that it seems that Mohan should go to meet Bhagwat someday and that he will not abuse or raise any hand with him
 jumma-jumma do saal bhi nahin hue the patrakarita ke
 For two days, he went to the Union Headquarters in Delhi and shot the day and night routine of the campaigners
 aaraam se tab ke sangh pramukh sudarshan ji se mil letaa tha
 Having said that i look at the Sangh critically
 mujhe laga shaayad ab vah sangh nahin rahaa magar apte ji se baat kar laga ki ab bhi he
 a spokesperson of that era does not even recognize these days
 pustak meley main mili to haath milaane par bhi aise chale gaye jaise kabhi dekha na ho
 Then they used to take lassi in their car
 khayr us bade prachaarak ne sangh ke kaaryon kaa lekha jokha khulkar bataaya
 i often tell people that critics of the Sangh do not know what the Sangh functions are
 sari aalochanaayen puraani jaankaree ke aadhaar par hai 
 Just hating is the same kind of undemocraticism as the abusers and justifying the abusers
 sangh ke kitne sanghathan chalate hai
 From doctors to lawyers and between officials, are the critics of the union aware? sangh ke logon kii ek baat prabhavit karti he, ve aalsee nahin hote
 Varna 590 Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Assam is not built in a day and by dreaming
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool nahin khul jate
 In any case, the Sangh has done this work
 ab un skulon main kya padhaayaa jaataa he or kaise padhaayaa jaataa he ise jaanane par hi aalochana karuunga
 It is not easy to arrange honorarium of five thousand of these teachers
 sirf assam main seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 The Congress's Seva Dal does the flag hoisting at headquarters
 thik he ki is tarah ke kaary tamaam anya sanghathan or enjio karte hai magar kya kis raajnneetik dal ke paas sangh he or sangh jaisaa bahuaiami satta sanghathan? kya sevadal ke log is sookhe ke daur main gaanv-gaanv jaakar seva nahin kar sakate the
 The organization and branches of the association across the country cannot have a headquarters
 nagpur ke bheetar kitne log honge jo itane kaamon par najar rakhte honge yaa charchaa karte honge
 i find this question surprising from the perspective of a curious journalist
 sangh lakh apane aapako saamaajik sanghathan kah le, lekin uske sansadhano or prachaarkon ke shram kaa pasinaa kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke kyon kaam aata he? sangh ke log ateet main kai dalon ke samarthan ke udhaaharan dene lagenge lekin pichley do dashakon se unka laabh sirf or sirf bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 That is when the Prime Minister and his cabinet arrive to report to the Union
 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi
 Nobody is talking about the danger of this religious political complex
 main aksar prachaarkon kii saadagi or maujuuda raajnneeti kii sampannataa ke antar se pareshaan hota hum
 The BJP has won by the hard work of the Sangh, but why is there no simplicity of the Sangh in the bjp's victory or its political culture
 sangh ise kaise pachaa letaa he, kya vah bhi vaise hi pachaa letaa he jaise jetali ji hamen trol kii samskruti pachaa lene kii salaah de rahe hai
 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it? Can the Sangh's loyalty lead to political victory without the bjp's enormous resources? If the pracharaks were successful in bringing the BJP to power, then how did they fail to save the political culture from glory
 kai mantri netaa sangh kii kasam khate hai magar unke silk kaa kurta or shawl kii keemat ek prachaarak ke saal bhar ke kharche se zyada hota he
 The price of the car is not included
 sangh kii tarah bijepi nahin ho saki to kya kaha ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii tarah sangh ho gaya he?tippaniyan How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Undoubtedly, the victory of Assam is the result of the hard work of countless Sangh pracharaks
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left
 Were
 maine apte ji ko badhai di or us bade prachaarak ko bhi badhai di jinhone naam na bataane ke liye kaha, magar kaam puraa bataaya
 It was not thought in the conversation that they were avoiding or hiding any questions
 mujhe yah baat pasand ai
 Thank you Apte and congratulations again
 bijepi kii jeet kaa jashn unke bhaavon main nahin utraa tha
 Apte ji began to speak in an impartial manner
 kaha bhi ki kabhi aaie baat karte hai
 The conduct of the people of the old generation union will not get a complaint
 2014 ke saal ke baad jis tarah se bijepi ke netaaon ne soshal media par abhadra or aloktantric bhashaa ko yuva kii bechaini kahkar manyata di he usase bilkul alag lagate hai yah log
 Recently, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in his Raviwar column of the Times of India justified the language of troll
 apni javaani main apatkaal ke khilaaf jail gaye vitt mantri jetali ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki trol ko nazarandaaj kiijie yaa pachaa lijie
 Look at the profile of abusers on social media
 khulkar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa kaaryakarta bataate hai, sanghathan ke pratikon kaa istamaal karte hai or maa-bahan kii gaaliyaan dete hai
 Humbling rumors against anyone spread rumors
 aaj is pachaane or sweekaar karne kii naseehat di ja rahi he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh talks about culture, but how do these leaders recognize in this ideology that grew up in its ideology
 sangh kaise chup rah saktaa he
 Even linguistic aggression is reflected in BJP spokespersons
 jo pravaktaa 2014 se pehle mujhe nirbhik or swatantra patrkaar kaha karte the ve bhi thik se baat nahin karte
 These people kept quiet even when i was abused from broker to my mother
 2005 main bihar chunaavon kii reporting par arun jetali ne meri tarif kii thi or susheel modi patna daftar milane aae the
 i could not even meet Sushil Modi in this election while the whole world went to interview him
 kiran bedi ke intervyuu se khaufjada the yaa susheel ji bhi kisi katutaa ke shikaar ho gaye, mujhe pataa nahin
 Nor do i want to know now
 ek vakt tha jab prakaash jaavdekar jaise bade netaa apni tamaam vyasttaaon ke bich mere kaarykram ke liye vakt nikaalte the
 He used to praise and answer strict questions with complete sanity
 jaavdekar sahab sneh se raavish bulaate the
 Then there was the UPA government
 tab dilli main shila dikshit kii sarkaar hua karti thi, jiske daavon ko maine raveesh kii report main khokhla sabit kar diya tha
 Then many of today's spokesmen used to message me that you have not called for a long time
 main yah baat bulaane yaa aane ke liye nahin likh rahaa
 They are also not coming
 mujhe latayin dilli ke taqatvar logon ke bich ghoomane kii chahat hi nahin he
 Never been jaahir he pravaktaa soshal media ke lafangon kii parvaah kar rahe hote hai jo ek fouj kii shakl main din raat kuch patrakaron ko gaaliyaan dete hai
 Barkha Dutt has been called Mort and i am 100 percent Mort
 shukr he in dinon main kisi raajnneetik pravaktaa ke saath prime time nahin kar rahaa, varna roj aise vyavhaaron kii pratikriya main uttejit hokar yaa aahat hokar ghar lautataa tha
 How the Sangh's old pracharaks would have been comfortable amid such an aggressive political style, it is difficult to say, until there is no public criticism about this upscale
 in sawaalon ko lekar ek din sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se sidhe-sidhe sawaal karne kaa iraadaa jarur he
 If they did not even call then there is nothing
 mujhe riject hone kii puraani aadat he
 i will write a public letter to Mohan Bhagwat one day
 mujhe yakeen he is apsamskruti ke khilaaf ve karrwai karenge or aise huddangiyon ko apane se alag karne kaa saahas dikhaaenge
 i will try to be like this at my level! i am a stubborn man, i will lose but i will fight, that too alone
 main apte ji ke bare main likhte-likhte yah baat kyon likh gaya
 Because in this era, courtesy was met after a long time
 mishthachaar bhi kahie
 He was speaking sweetly
 pehali baar phone karne par bhi bina koi sawaal kiye mere sawaal kaa jawaab dene lage
 Whether or not they listened properly but i said that i am a critic of the Sangh
 phir bhi ve baat kiye ja rahe the
 'no one knew then, there was a young man in Assam
 ek-ek kar logon se baat kii
 Madhusudan Das was an MLA of Praja Socialist Party
 ve gramin or kisaan netaa the
 Talking to him increased political contact
 phir assam main ghuspaith ke sawaalon par baat hone lagi
 For this i went to Shillong, then the capital of Assam used to be Shillong
 ' shilong kii rajdhani se ve janaganana kii report lekar aae
 Explained to Madhusudan ji and for the first time a committee was formed against infiltration in Assam
 kamaal kaa kissa sunaaya
 Did not even mention things that are not coats main kisi adrishy kalpana main kho gaya
 Today, there is a competition for those who take credit for the success of Assam, but how should a person who has gone from Nagpur to Assam at the age of 24 years feel
 phone par unki aawaaj se laga bhi nahin ki is jeet par unka daawa he
 Koi Sethi, who was taking credit in the media for social media management and strategy
 hansi aa gai mujhe
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work
 main aksar logon se kahata hum sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa hi nahin he ki sangh ke kaary kya hai
 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai
 How many organizations of the Union run
 doctor se lekar vakil tak main or adhikariyon ke bich, kya sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa he? One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he
 Now i will criticize only after knowing what is taught in those schools and how it is taught
 in shikshakon ke paanch hajaar ke maandey kii vyavastha karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Only seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work in Assam
 congress kaa seva dal mukhyalay main jhanda fahraane kaa kaam karata he
 It is okay that all other organizations and ngos do this kind of work, but which political party has a Sangh and a multidimensional power organization like the Sangh? Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga
 Adityanath is there in the Lok Sabha, there are two more sadhvi-sadhus
 gayatri parivaar ke pandya ji ne rajya sabha kaa prastaav thukraa diya magar prastaav mila to tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party did not do well by forming a party of the Idawa community in Kerala
 yah ek tarah se raajnneeti main outsorcing kaa nayaa udhaaharan he
 If you do not get the vote yourself, then make a separate party of the people of that community and seek it through the Mahant
 raajnneetik dal ko hameshaa apane kaaryakramon ke boote aage badhanaa chahie
 a Sangh leader said that sessions are held in Assam like in a monastery
 dhai sau satr hai jinke paas apni jaminen hai or jinke kuch hisson par bangladeshi musalamaanon ne kabja kar liya he
 The heads of these sessions are called Empowerments
 is baar in sabhi satradhikaron ko apane paale main laayaa gaya taaki inke bheetar bhakthi, sangeet or samskruti kaa prashikshan lene aane vaale hindu pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa saath de saken
 They are also hurt by the slogan of a union-free India
 magar bharat kii raajnneeti main punjab se shuru hua party or ashramon kaa complex banane kaa yah khel ab kahin zyada thos ho chukaa he
 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today
 pehle aashirwad maanga jaataa tha ab yah guru, mahant yaa satradhikaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke mahasachiv kii tarah vot maangane or jutaney kaa kaam karne lage hai
 BJP is also doing this work, Congress has been doing it somewhere and regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee too
 is dharmik raajnneetik complex ke khatre par koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 i am often disturbed by the difference between the simplicity of campaigners and the richness of current politics
 sangh kii mehnat se bijepi ko jeet mili he lekin bijepi kii jeet yaa uski raajnneetik samskruti main sangh kii saadagi kyon nahin he
 How does the Sangh digest it, does it digest it as Jaitley ji is advising us to digest the culture of trolls
 kya yah sawaal sangh se nahin poocha jaae ki aapke prachaarkon kii saadagi se congressi samskruti ke sam,daam, arth, dand or bhed ke rup bijepi main kaise hai? uttarakhand main kya hua? kahin aap bhi is sampannataa ke labhaarthi to nahin hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki sangh kii saadagi tabhi kaam kii jab bijepi ne isamen shahkharchi vaale chunavi prabandhan kaa chhaunk daalaa? kya bijepi ke akut sansadhano ke bina sangh kii nishtha raajnneetik jeet dilaa sakati he? agar prachaarak bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane main safal rahe to raajnneetik samskruti ko vaibhav se bachaane main kaise asafal rah gaye
 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak
 gaadi kii keemat isamen shaamil nahin he
 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh
 nisandeh assam kii jeet sangh ke anginat prachaarkon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 This effort is also commendable because before this one victory, they have gone through a thousand defeats
 itani haaron ke bich apane yakeen par tike rahe
 Just saying that the unions will create a free India is not enough
 kehane waalon ko pehle yah to pataa ho ki bharat main kahaan-kahaan kis str par sangh maujuud he
 The Sangh is not an affection for the Modi government
 vah modi sarkaar se pehle se he or uske baad bhi rahegaa
 The union has proved this
 raajnneetik aalochak sirf itnaa bataa den ki kya ve satta main rahete hue is tarah kaa raajnneetik sanghathan khadaa kar sake hai jahaan unke vaicharik aadarshon ko lekar aise log hon jo 24 saal kii umr main avadh tirhut express se guwahati chale jaaen, jaise apte ji chale gaye the
 i congratulated Apte and also congratulated the big publicist who asked not to be named, but told the work completed
 baatcheet main laga nahin ki kisi sawaal se batch rahe hon yaa chipa rahe hon
 i liked it apte ji shukriya or phir se badhai
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh talks about culture, but how do these leaders recognize in this ideology that grew up in its ideology
 sangh kaise chup rah saktaa he
 Even linguistic aggression is reflected in BJP spokespersons
 jo pravaktaa 2014 se pehle mujhe nirbhik or swatantra patrkaar kaha karte the ve bhi thik se baat nahin karte
 These people kept quiet even when i was abused from broker to my mother
 2005 main bihar chunaavon kii reporting par arun jetali ne meri tarif kii thi or susheel modi patna daftar milane aae the
 i could not even meet Sushil Modi in this election while the whole world went to interview him
 kiran bedi ke intervyuu se khaufjada the yaa susheel ji bhi kisi katutaa ke shikaar ho gaye, mujhe pataa nahin
 Nor do i want to know now
 ek vakt tha jab prakaash jaavdekar jaise bade netaa apni tamaam vyasttaaon ke bich mere kaarykram ke liye vakt nikaalte the
 He used to praise and answer strict questions with complete sanity
 jaavdekar sahab sneh se raavish bulaate the
 Then there was the UPA government
 tab dilli main shila dikshit kii sarkaar hua karti thi, jiske daavon ko maine raveesh kii report main khokhla sabit kar diya tha
 Then many of today's spokesmen used to message me that you have not called for a long time
 main yah baat bulaane yaa aane ke liye nahin likh rahaa
 They are also not coming
 mujhe latayin dilli ke taqatvar logon ke bich ghoomane kii chahat hi nahin he
 Never been jaahir he pravaktaa soshal media ke lafangon kii parvaah kar rahe hote hai jo ek fouj kii shakl main din raat kuch patrakaron ko gaaliyaan dete hai
 Barkha Dutt has been called Mort and i am 100 percent Mort
 shukr he in dinon main kisi raajnneetik pravaktaa ke saath prime time nahin kar rahaa, varna roj aise vyavhaaron kii pratikriya main uttejit hokar yaa aahat hokar ghar lautataa tha
 How the Sangh's old pracharaks would have been comfortable amid such an aggressive political style, it is difficult to say, until there is no public criticism about this upscale
 in sawaalon ko lekar ek din sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se sidhe-sidhe sawaal karne kaa iraadaa jarur he
 If they did not even call then there is nothing
 mujhe riject hone kii puraani aadat he
 i will write a public letter to Mohan Bhagwat one day
 mujhe yakeen he is apsamskruti ke khilaaf ve karrwai karenge or aise huddangiyon ko apane se alag karne kaa saahas dikhaaenge
 i will try to be like this at my level! i am a stubborn man, i will lose but i will fight, that too alone
 main apte ji ke bare main likhte-likhte yah baat kyon likh gaya
 Because in this era, courtesy was met after a long time
 mishthachaar bhi kahie
 He was speaking sweetly
 pehali baar phone karne par bhi bina koi sawaal kiye mere sawaal kaa jawaab dene lage
 Whether or not they listened properly but i said that i am a critic of the Sangh
 phir bhi ve baat kiye ja rahe the
 'no one knew then, there was a young man in Assam
 ek-ek kar logon se baat kii
 Madhusudan Das was an MLA of Praja Socialist Party
 ve gramin or kisaan netaa the
 Talking to him increased political contact
 phir assam main ghuspaith ke sawaalon par baat hone lagi
 For this i went to Shillong, then the capital of Assam used to be Shillong
 ' shilong kii rajdhani se ve janaganana kii report lekar aae
 Explained to Madhusudan ji and for the first time a committee was formed against infiltration in Assam
 kamaal kaa kissa sunaaya
 Did not even mention things that are not coats main kisi adrishy kalpana main kho gaya
 Today, there is a competition for those who take credit for the success of Assam, but how should a person who has gone from Nagpur to Assam at the age of 24 years feel
 phone par unki aawaaj se laga bhi nahin ki is jeet par unka daawa he
 Koi Sethi, who was taking credit in the media for social media management and strategy
 hansi aa gai mujhe
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work
 main aksar logon se kahata hum sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa hi nahin he ki sangh ke kaary kya hai
 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai
 How many organizations of the Union run
 doctor se lekar vakil tak main or adhikariyon ke bich, kya sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa he? One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he
 Now i will criticize only after knowing what is taught in those schools and how it is taught
 in shikshakon ke paanch hajaar ke maandey kii vyavastha karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Only seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work in Assam
 congress kaa seva dal mukhyalay main jhanda fahraane kaa kaam karata he
 It is okay that all other organizations and ngos do this kind of work, but which political party has a Sangh and a multidimensional power organization like the Sangh? Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga
 Adityanath is there in the Lok Sabha, there are two more sadhvi-sadhus
 gayatri parivaar ke pandya ji ne rajya sabha kaa prastaav thukraa diya magar prastaav mila to tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party did not do well by forming a party of the Idawa community in Kerala
 yah ek tarah se raajnneeti main outsorcing kaa nayaa udhaaharan he
 If you do not get the vote yourself, then make a separate party of the people of that community and seek it through the Mahant
 raajnneetik dal ko hameshaa apane kaaryakramon ke boote aage badhanaa chahie
 a Sangh leader said that sessions are held in Assam like in a monastery
 dhai sau satr hai jinke paas apni jaminen hai or jinke kuch hisson par bangladeshi musalamaanon ne kabja kar liya he
 The heads of these sessions are called Empowerments
 is baar in sabhi satradhikaron ko apane paale main laayaa gaya taaki inke bheetar bhakthi, sangeet or samskruti kaa prashikshan lene aane vaale hindu pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa saath de saken
 They are also hurt by the slogan of a union-free India
 magar bharat kii raajnneeti main punjab se shuru hua party or ashramon kaa complex banane kaa yah khel ab kahin zyada thos ho chukaa he
 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today
 pehle aashirwad maanga jaataa tha ab yah guru, mahant yaa satradhikaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke mahasachiv kii tarah vot maangane or jutaney kaa kaam karne lage hai
 BJP is also doing this work, Congress has been doing it somewhere and regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee too
 is dharmik raajnneetik complex ke khatre par koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 i am often disturbed by the difference between the simplicity of campaigners and the richness of current politics
 sangh kii mehnat se bijepi ko jeet mili he lekin bijepi kii jeet yaa uski raajnneetik samskruti main sangh kii saadagi kyon nahin he
 How does the Sangh digest it, does it digest it as Jaitley ji is advising us to digest the culture of trolls
 kya yah sawaal sangh se nahin poocha jaae ki aapke prachaarkon kii saadagi se congressi samskruti ke sam,daam, arth, dand or bhed ke rup bijepi main kaise hai? uttarakhand main kya hua? kahin aap bhi is sampannataa ke labhaarthi to nahin hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki sangh kii saadagi tabhi kaam kii jab bijepi ne isamen shahkharchi vaale chunavi prabandhan kaa chhaunk daalaa? kya bijepi ke akut sansadhano ke bina sangh kii nishtha raajnneetik jeet dilaa sakati he? agar prachaarak bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane main safal rahe to raajnneetik samskruti ko vaibhav se bachaane main kaise asafal rah gaye
 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak
 gaadi kii keemat isamen shaamil nahin he
 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh
 nisandeh assam kii jeet sangh ke anginat prachaarkon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 This effort is also commendable because before this one victory, they have gone through a thousand defeats
 itani haaron ke bich apane yakeen par tike rahe
 Just saying that the unions will create a free India is not enough
 kehane waalon ko pehle yah to pataa ho ki bharat main kahaan-kahaan kis str par sangh maujuud he
 The Sangh is not an affection for the Modi government
 vah modi sarkaar se pehle se he or uske baad bhi rahegaa
 The union has proved this
 raajnneetik aalochak sirf itnaa bataa den ki kya ve satta main rahete hue is tarah kaa raajnneetik sanghathan khadaa kar sake hai jahaan unke vaicharik aadarshon ko lekar aise log hon jo 24 saal kii umr main avadh tirhut express se guwahati chale jaaen, jaise apte ji chale gaye the
 i congratulated Apte and also congratulated the big publicist who asked not to be named, but told the work completed
 baatcheet main laga nahin ki kisi sawaal se batch rahe hon yaa chipa rahe hon
 i liked it apte ji shukriya or phir se badhai
 Why did i write this while writing about Apteji? isliye ki is daur main bahut dinon baad shishtachar se mulaakaat hui
 Also say obedience
 mithe-mithe bol rahe the
 On calling for the first time, i started answering my question without any question
 unhone thik se suna yaa nahin lekin maine kaha ki main sangh kaa aalochak hum
 Still they were being talked about
 'assam main tab koi nahin jaanata tha, noujvaan tha
 Talked to people one by one
 praja socialist party ke ek vidhayak hue the madhusudan das
 He was a rural and peasant leader
 unase baat karte-karte raajnneetik sampark badhaayaa
 Then questions of infiltration started in Assam
 iske liye main shilong gaya, tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 'they brought census reports from the capital of Shillong
 madhusudan ji ko samajhaayaa or pehali baar assam main ghuspaith ke khilaaf ek cameti bani
 Told the wonderful story
 na kot karne vaali baaten bhi bataayin! i got lost in an invisible fantasy
 aaj assam kii kamyaabi kaa shrey lene waalon kii hode he lekin jo vyakti 24 saal kii umr main nagpur se assam gaya ho use kaisaa lag rahaa hoga
 His voice on the phone did not even indicate that he had a claim on this victory
 koi sethi the, jo media main shrey le rahe the soshal media prabandhan or ranneeti kaa
 i laughed
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie
 Seeing in the video, Shankar Das ji was talking
 karyaalay main koi rang gulaal nahin, koi tamaasha nahin
 It felt as if neither worked for it nor the power that came from it
 najadik jane par sangh ke puraane log dhang se baat karte hai
 Also talk to me and do not abuse
 tabhi to ek bade prachaarak ne phone nahin kaata
 The introduction did not say that you are against me
 soshal media par sanghee hone kaa daawa karne waalon kii tarah maa-bahan kii gaali nahin di
 i feel that this abuse is such a reality now that it seems that Mohan should go to meet Bhagwat someday and that he will not abuse or raise any hand with him
 jumma-jumma do saal bhi nahin hue the patrakarita ke
 For two days, he went to the Union Headquarters in Delhi and shot the day and night routine of the campaigners
 aaraam se tab ke sangh pramukh sudarshan ji se mil letaa tha
 Having said that i look at the Sangh critically
 mujhe laga shaayad ab vah sangh nahin rahaa magar apte ji se baat kar laga ki ab bhi he
 a spokesperson of that era does not even recognize these days
 pustak meley main mili to haath milaane par bhi aise chale gaye jaise kabhi dekha na ho
 Then they used to take lassi in their car
 khayr us bade prachaarak ne sangh ke kaaryon kaa lekha jokha khulkar bataaya
 i often tell people that critics of the Sangh do not know what the Sangh functions are
 sari aalochanaayen puraani jaankaree ke aadhaar par hai 
 Just hating is the same kind of undemocraticism as the abusers and justifying the abusers
 sangh ke kitne sanghathan chalate hai
 From doctors to lawyers and between officials, are the critics of the union aware? sangh ke logon kii ek baat prabhavit karti he, ve aalsee nahin hote
 Varna 590 Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Assam is not built in a day and by dreaming
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool nahin khul jate
 In any case, the Sangh has done this work
 ab un skulon main kya padhaayaa jaataa he or kaise padhaayaa jaataa he ise jaanane par hi aalochana karuunga
 It is not easy to arrange honorarium of five thousand of these teachers
 sirf assam main seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 The Congress's Seva Dal does the flag hoisting at headquarters
 thik he ki is tarah ke kaary tamaam anya sanghathan or enjio karte hai magar kya kis raajnneetik dal ke paas sangh he or sangh jaisaa bahuaiami satta sanghathan? kya sevadal ke log is sookhe ke daur main gaanv-gaanv jaakar seva nahin kar sakate the
 The organization and branches of the association across the country cannot have a headquarters
 nagpur ke bheetar kitne log honge jo itane kaamon par najar rakhte honge yaa charchaa karte honge
 i find this question surprising from the perspective of a curious journalist
 sangh lakh apane aapako saamaajik sanghathan kah le, lekin uske sansadhano or prachaarkon ke shram kaa pasinaa kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke kyon kaam aata he? sangh ke log ateet main kai dalon ke samarthan ke udhaaharan dene lagenge lekin pichley do dashakon se unka laabh sirf or sirf bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 That is when the Prime Minister and his cabinet arrive to report to the Union
 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi
 Nobody is talking about the danger of this religious political complex
 main aksar prachaarkon kii saadagi or maujuuda raajnneeti kii sampannataa ke antar se pareshaan hota hum
 The BJP has won by the hard work of the Sangh, but why is there no simplicity of the Sangh in the bjp's victory or its political culture
 sangh ise kaise pachaa letaa he, kya vah bhi vaise hi pachaa letaa he jaise jetali ji hamen trol kii samskruti pachaa lene kii salaah de rahe hai
 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it? Can the Sangh's loyalty lead to political victory without the bjp's enormous resources? If the pracharaks were successful in bringing the BJP to power, then how did they fail to save the political culture from glory
 kai mantri netaa sangh kii kasam khate hai magar unke silk kaa kurta or shawl kii keemat ek prachaarak ke saal bhar ke kharche se zyada hota he
 The price of the car is not included
 sangh kii tarah bijepi nahin ho saki to kya kaha ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii tarah sangh ho gaya he?tippaniyan How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Undoubtedly, the victory of Assam is the result of the hard work of countless Sangh pracharaks
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left
 Were
 maine apte ji ko badhai di or us bade prachaarak ko bhi badhai di jinhone naam na bataane ke liye kaha, magar kaam puraa bataaya
 It was not thought in the conversation that they were avoiding or hiding any questions
 mujhe yah baat pasand ai
 Thank you Apte and congratulations again
 main kisi adrishy kalpana main kho gaya
 Today, there is a competition for those who take credit for the success of Assam, but how should a person who has gone from Nagpur to Assam at the age of 24 years feel
 phone par unki aawaaj se laga bhi nahin ki is jeet par unka daawa he
 Koi Sethi, who was taking credit in the media for social media management and strategy
 hansi aa gai mujhe
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work

 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai

Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga
 Adityanath is there in the Lok Sabha, there are two more sadhvi-sadhus
 gayatri parivaar ke pandya ji ne rajya sabha kaa prastaav thukraa diya magar prastaav mila to tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party did not do well by forming a party of the Idawa community in Kerala

 If you do not get the vote yourself, then make a separate party of the people of that community and seek it through the Mahant
 raajnneetik dal ko hameshaa apane kaaryakramon ke boote aage badhanaa chahie
 a Sangh leader said that sessions are held in Assam like in a monastery
 dhai sau satr hai jinke paas apni jaminen hai or jinke kuch hisson par bangladeshi musalamaanon ne kabja kar liya he
 The heads of these sessions are called Empowerments
 is baar in sabhi satradhikaron ko apane paale main laayaa gaya taaki inke bheetar bhakthi, sangeet or samskruti kaa prashikshan lene aane vaale hindu pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa saath de saken
 They are also hurt by the slogan of a union-free India
 magar bharat kii raajnneeti main punjab se shuru hua party or ashramon kaa complex banane kaa yah khel ab kahin zyada thos ho chukaa he
 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today
 pehle aashirwad maanga jaataa tha ab yah guru, mahant yaa satradhikaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke mahasachiv kii tarah vot maangane or jutaney kaa kaam karne lage hai
 BJP is also doing this work, Congress has been doing it somewhere and regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee too
 is dharmik raajnneetik complex ke khatre par koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 i am often disturbed by the difference between the simplicity of campaigners and the richness of current politics
 sangh kii mehnat se bijepi ko jeet mili he lekin bijepi kii jeet yaa uski raajnneetik samskruti main sangh kii saadagi kyon nahin he
 How does the Sangh digest it, does it digest it as Jaitley ji is advising us to digest the culture of trolls
 kya yah sawaal sangh se nahin poocha jaae ki aapke prachaarkon kii saadagi se congressi samskruti ke sam,daam, arth, dand or bhed ke rup bijepi main kaise hai? uttarakhand main kya hua? kahin aap bhi is sampannataa ke labhaarthi to nahin hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki sangh kii saadagi tabhi kaam kii jab bijepi ne isamen shahkharchi vaale chunavi prabandhan kaa chhaunk daalaa? kya bijepi ke akut sansadhano ke bina sangh kii nishtha raajnneetik jeet dilaa sakati he? agar prachaarak bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane main safal rahe to raajnneetik samskruti ko vaibhav se bachaane main kaise asafal rah gaye
 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak
 gaadi kii keemat isamen shaamil nahin he
 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh
 nisandeh assam kii jeet sangh ke anginat prachaarkon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 This effort is also commendable because before this one victory, they have gone through a thousand defeats
 itani haaron ke bich apane yakeen par tike rahe
 Just saying that the unions will create a free India is not enough
 kehane waalon ko pehle yah to pataa ho ki bharat main kahaan-kahaan kis str par sangh maujuud he
 The Sangh is not an affection for the Modi government
 vah modi sarkaar se pehle se he or uske baad bhi rahegaa
 The union has proved this
 raajnneetik aalochak sirf itnaa bataa den ki kya ve satta main rahete hue is tarah kaa raajnneetik sanghathan khadaa kar sake hai jahaan unke vaicharik aadarshon ko lekar aise log hon jo 24 saal kii umr main avadh tirhut express se guwahati chale jaaen, jaise apte ji chale gaye the
 i congratulated Apte and also congratulated the big publicist who asked not to be named, but told the work completed
 baatcheet main laga nahin ki kisi sawaal se batch rahe hon yaa chipa rahe hon
 i liked it apte ji shukriya or phir se badhai
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work
 main aksar logon se kahata hum sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa hi nahin he ki sangh ke kaary kya hai
 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai
 How many organizations of the Union run
 doctor se lekar vakil tak main or adhikariyon ke bich, kya sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa he? One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he
 Now i will criticize only after knowing what is taught in those schools and how it is taught

 One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he

 It is okay that all other organizations and ngos do this kind of work, but which political party has a Sangh and a multidimensional power organization like the Sangh? Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga

 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today

 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak

 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh

 How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Undoubtedly, the victory of Assam is the result of the hard work of countless Sangh pracharaks
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left

 On Tuesday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a message fixed 'suddenly' in the name of the nation, announced the closure of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from midnight on Tuesday, and said that new notes of 500 rupees and 2,000 rupees will be introduced
 
 ghoshnaa ke tahat yah bhi kaha gaya ki aspataalon tathaa petrol panpon par shuukravaar tak maujuuda noton ko chalaaya ja sakegaa
 The comments lekin iske baad kai jagah se is tarah kii shikaayatein milane lageen ki petrol pump vaale bhi 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke maujuuda noton ko lene se inkaar kar rahe hai, or phir sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko janata se kaha ki agar koi petrol pump vaala aisa karata he, to ve unhen twit kar bataa sakate hai, or turant madad muhaiyaa karwaai jaaegi
 But in the meantime, according to a news from Shimla, the capital of Himachal Pradesh, the petrol pumps there have tried to appease both sides by enforcing the rule that they will accept the existing notes, but for more than Rs 500 Petrol will not be filled in any car

 com / sizwrfobmi — ANI (@ani_news) November 9, 2016 According to the news agency ANI, the petrol pumps of Shimla have told their customers that they can pay petrol from the existing notes, but the condition is that their car will not be filled with more than Rs 500 petrol
 is niyam ke banane se na sirf sarkaar se shikaayat kiye jane ke avasar lagbhag khatm ho gaye, balki graahakon ko bhi 'samathing iz better dain nathing' kii tarj par kuch raahat mili
 But after this, complaints started coming from many places that even petrol pump owners are refusing to take the current notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, and then on Wednesday the government told the public that if someone with a petrol pump would do so If so, they can tweet and tell them, and help will be provided immediately
 lekin isi bich, himachal pradesh kii rajdhani shimla se mili ek khabar ke mutabik, vahaan ke petrol panpon ne donon pakshon ko khush karne kii koshish karte hue niyam lagu kiya he ki ve maujuuda noton ko sweekaar kar lenge, lekin 500 rupee se zyaada rakam kaa petrol kisi gaadi main bhi nahin bharenge

 The creation of this rule not only ended the opportunity to complain to the government, but also brought some relief to the customers on the lines of 'something is better than nothing'

 com important date - 12 December ek daur tha jab team india kaa naam sunate hi satta bazaar tauba-tauba karne lagata tha
 Because he felt that betting on Team India was the biggest gamble
 pataa nahin wo kab kise haraa de or kab kisase haar jaae
 She could defeat the World Champion in the very next match, losing to the worst of the team
 aise main team india satorion kii kabhi fevorett nahin ban pai
 But after Dhoni's leadership, Team India is wreaking havoc at the moment, now the same speculative market is speaking, Wow India! team india jis tarah se ek ke baad ek maidan fateh karti ja rahi he, usne naa sirf satta bazaar kaa ganit gadabada diya he balki bhartiya team ko lekar uski soch bhi puri tarah se badal gai he
 The Indian team on which the betting market was once considered the most risky task after Pakistan, the same betting market is the team India that has the most confidence in any team at this time
 satta bazaar kii maane to bhale hi isisi rankig main team india number van naa ho lekin sattebaazon kii ranking main wo naa sirf number van he balki usapar daav lagaana sabase surakshit bhi
 Team India may have been shocked by winning four consecutive One Day matches in the current india-sri Lanka series
 lekin sattebaazon ko is nattejey par koi hairaani nahin he
 Before the start of the series, Team India was the favorite team of bookies and expected similar results
 siries shuru hone se pehle satta bazaar main bharat kaa bhav jahaan 45 paise tha vahiin lanka kaa 70 paise
 That is, a person who put one lakh rupees on the victory of India had to get a profit of only 45 thousand whereas on the victory of Lanka, there was a profit of 70 thousand directly on the claim of one lakh
 satta bazaar ke is bhav se hi saaf tha ki wo siries shuru hone se pehle hi bharat kii jeet tay maan chuki thi or hua bhi thik vaisaa hi
 According to Satta Bazaar, this change in the claim of Team India is a consistently better performance of the Indian team, series by series
 chaahe wo 20-20 ho, team india kaa australia daura, pakistan kaa bharat daura, australia kaa india daura yaa phir englad ke khilaaf gharelu siries
 In every series, the Indian team not only played dominating but also won many close matches and misjudged the notion that Team India is not a good finisher
 satta bazaar kii maane to maujuuda bhartiya team test or van-de donon main hi dhoni kii aguai main jabardast utsaah, vishwaas or dilari se aage bad rahi he
 He has also shown that he is not just a lion at home by winning one-day series in Australia, Lanka and England, and this success of Team India has made him a favorite of the bookies
 gautam gambhir, eshanth sharma, yusuf pathan, suresh raina, rohit sharma or praveen kumaar jaise nae khilaadiyon ke jabardast pradarshan ko dekhte hue satta bazaar bhi ab ye maan kar chal rahaa he ki wo din dur nahin jab test or van-de kii ranking main bhi bharat number van hoga
 Overall, there is only one mantra in the speculative market at present, Dhoni's boys are guaranteed a chance
 team india beshak satta bazaar kii favorit ban gai he
 But the Indian speculative market is also suffering from this
 satta bazaar kii maane to favorit hone ke naate team india kaa bhav kam hone kii vajah se bahut se log usapar daav hi nahin khel rahe
 By the way, the speculative market is hoping that there will be a big claim for a 5–0 win against Lanka
 team india ne srilanka ko paanch maichon kii siries 4-0 se dho kar bhale hi apni ranking sudhaar lee ho lekin is nattejey ne satta bazaar kii kamai kam kar di
 As the series went unilaterally, as the price of India kept decreasing, the claimants also started pulling their hands
 natijatan sarij ke pehle do maichon main satta bazaar ne jitani kamai kii thi tisare match main bharat kii jeet ke baad se kamai girti chali gai
 Now the last match of the series is to be played on Sunday
 chunki siries kaa faisla ho chukaa he lihaaja satta bazaar kaa ab puraa daav is baat par laga he ki kya bharat ye siries 5-0 se jitegaa yaa nahin? satta bazaar ke mutabik bhartiya team ke maujuuda farm ko dekhte hue nateeja 5-0 hi dikh rahaa he or satta bazaar ne bhav bhi isi hisaab se kholaa he
 In the last one-day, the rate of India's caste is 35 paise, whereas the rate of India's caste is 1
 50 rupye he
 That is, Lanka does not postpone the 5–0 defeat in terms of sentiment
 satta bazaar ke mutabik siries shuru hone se pehle bharat or lanka ke satorion ke bich donon tiimon ke bhav ko lekar kaaphi fark tha
 As the match was taking place in Lanka, many bookies in Asia opened their doors to the Lankan victory, considering the domestic advantage
 jabaki bhartiya satta bazaar ne bharat kii jeet par bhav khole
 The speculative market suffered most of the losses due to the opening of different prices
 vaise satta bazaar kii ek or pareshaani bhi he
 Some big bookies believe that the way India is being considered as a favorite in every series, it will reduce the number of people who are paying money on India
 kyonki satta khilne vaale amuman usee team par paisa lagaana pasand karte hai jisapar daav lagane se munafa zyada ho
 However, the speculative market is hopeful that India's prices may go up in the New Zealand tour starting next month
 kyonki ek to newjiland kii team apane ghar main sher he or duusari, vahaan kii vikaten bilkul alag
 Apart from this, this will be the first New Zealand tour of more than half the Indian players
 yani bhale hi is vakt team india satta bazaar kii sabase pasandida team ho lekin asli imtehaan farvari main newjiland main hi hoga

 18 months before the Lok Sabha elections, the left-wing CPM has started a war on whether to go or not with the Congress
 CPM do dhadon main banty najar aa rahi he
 One camp is in favor of Congress and the other is against it

 Although the Congress is not directly mentioned in this proposal, according to sources close to Yechury, Yechury wants to enter the political arena by entering into an ideological and electoral agreement with all secular parties, including the Congress, in the next Lok Sabha elections
 duusari taraf prakaash karaat ne ek doosraa prastaav kendriya samiti kii baithak main rakhaa, jisamen vampanthi dalon ko kisi bhi party se chunavi talmail na karne kii baat kahi gai he

 The Naxalites have submerged all the boats at Kodar Ghat near Barsur to prevent villagers from the villages across the Indravati river in the Naxal-affected Dantewada district of the state

 With these boats, villagers would reach to vote on 11 November

 Apart from the two boats provided by the administration, 6 small canoes made by the villagers are available at this ghat on normal days
 naksaliyon ne sabhi naaven pani main duubo di hai
 In this regard Tehsildar RK Kripal of Geedam said, "the administration had received reports of 2 boats being submerged, the report has been given

 isaki shuruyaat thodi der se jarur hui, lekin yah yaadgaar ban gaya
 Unlike other sports, there was no international tournament in cricket
 or jab isaki shuruyaat hui to purush khilaadiyon ko isse baahar rakhaa gaya, kyonki cricket kaa pehla vishwa cap mahila khilaadiyon kaa tha
 There was a shortage of money in men's sports
 vajah yah thi ki paison ke maamle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaane vaale england main pratham shrenee ke maichon main darshakon kii sankhya teji se ghat rahi thi or kai county karj main duube hue the
 Then, viewership was decreasing in Test matches that did not have England
 jaahir he, darshakon main ruchi jagaane ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kii jarurat thi
 But if an international test championship were held, there would be a big problem of money and arrangements
 iskaa boj uthaane ke liye koi taiyaar nahin tha
 Test cricket was the only established format at that time
 haa, english county timen jarur 40 or 60 over ke match khel rahi thim
 But before the 1975 World Cup, all international teams had played only 20 overs
 isliye ekadivasiy match zyaadaatar khiladiyon ke liye ek nai cheez thi
 It was a completely new format for audiences outside England
 west indies kii team 1975 main nae sire se taiyaar ho rahi thi
 Rohan Kanhai left the captaincy a year ago and i was given the captaincy
 us samay main 30 saal kaa tha or hamaari team yuva va anbhavi khilaadiyon ke mail se santulit team kii shakl akhriyaar kar rahi thi
 However, our fast bowlers' aggressive quartet was still a thing of the future
 hamaare paas kuch ol-rounder khilaadi the or vivian richards, gorden greenidge va roy fredericks jaise kuch behtareen fielder the
 One thing in our favor was that some of our players had experience playing county cricket, such as Keith Boes, who played for Essex or Derrick Moore, who played for Warwickshire
 tab west indies or australia ko mukhya daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 We both competed in the final
 ham romanchit the or jeetna chaahate the
 It was not the era of analysts, strategists and psychologists
 hamen sara manobal apane andar se hi jutanaa hota tha
 i started learning the basics of strategy and analysis during the 1974 five-test tour of India
 ham jaanate the ki 60 overon ke match main hamen kis tarah khelnaa he
 Since the rules of fielding were different in those days, in which there was no inner circle in the first 15 overs, we knew very well how many runs would be the target
 phir bhi ham apni virdohi tiimon ko kam karke nahin aankate the
 Australia's Chapel brothers, Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, and Pakistan's Zaheer Abbas and Asif Iqbal had considerable experience playing in England
 pakistan kii team apane saath 18 saal kaa ek ladkaa javed miyandad ko lekar ai thi, jo kaaphi pratibhavan maaloom hota tha
 The fourth team in our group was Sri Lanka
 vah shaayad ekmaatr team thi, jo abhi sthapit nahin hui thi
 But he was not as much a novice as the East Africa team
 zyaadaatar match kaaphi kade mukaable vaale rahe
 The biggest turning point for the West Indies came when we won by one wicket against Pakistan in Birmingham with just two balls left
 yah aisa match tha, jisane hamaare gendbaajon endi roberts, kith boes, barnard julian or vanburn holder kii kadi pariksha lee
 Importantly, a week before the final, we played against Australia at the Oval and with 14 overs remaining we won by seven wickets
 us match main dhardaar gendbaaj lily ke khilaaf alvin kaalicharan ke javaabi hamale kaa vishesh yogadan tha
 The final was memorable for many reasons
 yah mere liye bahut special tha, kyonki maine 85 gendon par 102 ran banaae the
 That match is also remembered because Ross Edwards gave up my catch at midwicket
 us samay main 26 ran par khel rahaa tha
 After that i made no mistake
 main rohan ke prati abhaari rahoonga jo duusare chor se mujhe sahaara dete rahe
 Our innings was satisfactory, because when i came to play with Rohan, we were in trouble and our score of 291 runs seemed like a mountain at that time
 zyada badi baat he ki us jeet ne sirf cricket ke kaaran sangathit 50 lakh kii aabaadi vaale chote-se desh ko world champion kaa khitaab thama diya
 We played for Gaurav and were victorious
 hamaare vetan main bahut zyada ijapha to nahin hua lekin us tamge ne hamaare cricket board ko duusare bordon ke khilaaf majboot sthiti main laa diya

 The conference is organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Brookings Institute, a research institute based in Washington
 unhone kaha ki arthvyavastha ke punaruddhar ke shuruaati varsh main hamaari niryaat vruddhi majboot rahi he
 In times of crisis, those areas in the US stood more strongly, which was getting an opportunity to export to India and other emerging countries
 vittamantri ne kaha ki niryaat vruddhi se desh main zyada rojgaar, zyada aay tathaa vruddhi main madad milti he
 Based on this, the American people can be told why our strong relationship with India is important
 unhone kaha ki bharat kii aarthik vruddhi se america ko koi khatra nahin he balki hamen isse phayda hi he
 He further said that America is also benefiting from the efficiency of Indian companies and employees working here
 america vitt mantri ne kaha ki agar hamaari vruddhi nivesh or niryaat prerit he to isse america bhavishya main zyada safal hoga
 In response to the questions, Gatner said, cooperation between the two countries is in the interest of each other and there is ample opportunity for the private sector to benefit
 unhone kaha, lekin kai aisi chijen hai jo in sambandhon ke raste main he
 Gradually they are being resolved
