 We keep showing you many pictures of playing with the game in India and hope that such stories will not come to us next time, but seeing the condition of two boxers in Kanpur, it can be guessed that despite all the efforts, there is no place for the players

 The comments wo kehete hai ki 2-3 saal se nesanals ho nahin rahe
 If the players are unable to participate in these tournaments then they are not getting jobs
 wo poochhate hai ki aise main koun maa-baap apane bacchon ko mukkebaazi ke liye ring main bhejnaa chahega? The boxers want to be Mary Kom or Vijender Singh
 lekin agar halaat thik nahin kiye gaye to is khel ke prati berukhi kaa bura asar padate der nahin lagegi
 Surprisingly, the condition of boxing is such that through this game India has won medals in the last two Olympic Games

 Where to get their accounts? Apart from this they need kits and shoes which are quite expensive
 " Wherever his mother Qamar is concerned about the needs of the daughter
 wo kahati hai ki rukhsaar ke liye gloves, mojey or duusari zarurat kii chizon ko ikattha karnaa itane paise main aasaan nahin he
 Boxing is perhaps even worse - the picture of Kamal Kumar passing by and heartbreaking

 tippaniyan They say that nationals have not been in place for 2-3 years
 khilaadi in toornament main hissaa nahin le paa rahe to unhen naukari nahin mil rahi

 Ganesan said that although it was a provision that 15 years after the Constitution came into force, Parliament could pass legislation to use Devanagari numerals on currency notes
 lekin is tarah kaa koi kanoon paas nahin kiya gaya
 Ganesan claimed that there is also no provision under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 that allows printing of banknotes of 2000 rupees without the recommendation of the Central Board

 Mayawati got angry on this question and said that Modi is not really a fakir, but a very rich man
 unka kahana tha ki vah modi ko maldaar aadmi isliye kah rahi hai, kyonki jo dhanseth aurpunjipatiyonka sangrakshak ho, use bhala or kya kaha jaae

 Today we had a mother on board travelling with four little boys
 Two of the boys were just babies
 Naturally one cannot travel with two babies on one's lap, so we had to solve the dilemma of missing lap, otherwise it would have been a no go for mom and the kids
 Luckily we had our positioning crew on board and wonderful Tom took the task of being the extra-lap

 24 hafte ke bhrun ke garbhpaat kii maang karne vaali mahila kii yachika par supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko aadesh diya he ki vah keiem medical college main ek medical board kaa gathan kare
 This board will examine the woman and find out whether the fetus is truly abnormal
 is maamle main maharashtra sarkaar ko somvaar tak jaanch report daakhil kerani hogi
 The Supreme Court issued notice to the Central and Maharashtra governments on the petition of the woman seeking abortion
 sarvocch adaalat ne kaha he ki medical report dekhne ke baad is maamle kaa faisla kiya jayega
 The rape victim is a petitioner
 The woman, who describes herself as a rape victim, says that her brutality is not normal
 aanton kii samasya ke saath hi mastishk bhi viksit nahin ho rahaa he
 There is a possibility of dying as soon as the baby is born
 mahila ne 20 hafte tak hi garbhpaat kii manzuri ke kanoon kii samiksha kii bhi maang kii he
 The petition challenges section 3 (b) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act
 20 hafte ke baad garbhpaat karana gaiyrkanooneemang kii gai he ki ise asanvaidhanik ghoshit kiya jaae
 According to this section, abortion cannot be done after 20 weeks
 yachika ke mutabik 1971 main jab ye kanoon bana tha tab bhale hi is dhara kaa auchity ho saktaa he lekin aaj iskaa auchity nahin he
 Because such modern techniques exist which can lead to miscarriage even after 26 weeks
 yachika ke mutabik bhrun main kai gambhir anuvaanshik kharabi kaa pataa 20 hafte ke baad hi chal paata he
 Therefore, not allowing abortion after 20 weeks is very strict and unfair and violates Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution
 aborshan act ko di gai chunautiyachika main medical termination of pregnancy (amtipi) act kii dhara 5 kii bhi sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko bhi chunauti di gai he
 Doctors in hospitals make very narrow sense of this stream
 20 hafte baad agar kisi anuvaanshik vikaar kaa pataa chalata he or koi mahilagarbhapaatakarana chaahati he to bhi wo is dhara ke chalate garbhpaat nahin kara sakati
 Therefore, this stream ignores the physical and mental pain that a mother has in giving birth to any such child
 yachika main is dhara ko bhi radd karne kii maang kii gai he kyonki ye dhara bhi samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 or 21 kaa ulanghan karti he
 Report of the committee appearing in court The petitioner has demanded that the report of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) committee be produced in the court
 is kamity main swasthya sachiv, naresh dayaal(purv sachiv,ai si em aar) or dow enke ganguli shaamil hai
 The petition has also demanded that the central government direct all hospitals to form an additional panel of doctors who can abort such rape victims girls and women who are pregnant for more than 20 weeks and want to do so

 The Delhi Police has uncovered an international racket of kidney thieves who thrived in the country's renowned Apollo Hospital
 is racket ke taar desh ke alag-alag rajyon ke saath-saath ilaaj ke liye hindustan aane vaale videshiyon tak faile hue the
 Businessmen used to buy kidneys at a price and then sold them to sick people for a hefty amount
 ab police ko shaq he ki is racket main kai bade log or doctor bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Networkji has spread abroad; Yes, the same Apollo Hospitals, where frequently known celebrities reach for their treatment
 jis aspataal ko tamaam suvidhaon se las mana jaataa he
 But would you believe that a huge kidney racket had been working for six months in this hospital, right in front of Sarita Vihar police station and DCP office of South East district? a kidney racket whose wires were not only spread across the country but also abroad
 or jisane ab tak dhandhebaazi main lakhon nahin, balki karodon rupye ke vaare-nyaare kar die?kidney racket kaa adda apollo aspataalaye baaten ajeeb lagati hai, lekin ab dilli police ne jo khulaasa kiya he, usase saafe ho gaya he ki haa, ye racketariyon ne is aspataal ko apana adda bana liya tha
 The racket was first discovered by the Delhi Police when a couple arrived at the Sarita Vihar police station in front of the hospital complaining of a quarrel
 darasal, donon kidney ke bandarbaant ke dhandhe ke mohare the or donon ke bich kidney kii kharid-farokht kii rakam ko lekar hi ladaai ho gai thi
 Reveal of such racket occurred when the police tried to resolve the dispute between the two, a new story of kidney racket came out
 iske baad police ne ek-ek is racket ke paanch dhandhebaazon kaa giraftaar kar liya
 Aseem Sikdar, Satya Prakash aka Ashu, Devashish Mallik, Aditya and Shailesh Saxena
 haalanki police kii maane to is racket kaa mastermind rajkumaar raav naam kaa ek shaks ab bhi faraar he
 And now the police are raiding many places like Kolkata, Chennai and Coimbatore chasing the other businessmen of this racket
 aise kaam karata he ye kidney racketis racket main har dhandhebaaz ke hisse kaa kaam banta hua tha
 Some hunted for the donor, while some searched for the receiver
 phir shikaar or donor ko rishtedaar dikhaane ke liye farzi kaagazat banaae jate the
 Hospital staff assisted him in this task
 phir donor or resiver ko aspataal main bhartee karavaaya jaataa tha
 And the deal was completed in 10-15 days
 racket main rupayon kii bandarbaant apane-aap main ek chaunkaanewaali baat he
 This racket used to charge 20 to 25 lakhs for the kidneys from the needy
 isamen bichauliyon ko 1-1 lakh rupye milte the
 While only 3 to 4 lakh to the donor
 yahi vajah he ki dhandhebaaz jagah-jagah se donor or resiver kii talash karte hai, farzi kagajaat taiyaar karavaate hai or phir lakhon rupee kii vasuuli karte hai
 The special thing is that for selling kidneys to foreign needy, they get many times more money than Hindustani
 bade doctor bhi hai shaamil!aise main sawaal ye he ki aakhir baaki kii moti raqam kahaan jaati thi
 And this is the reason why the police now feel that there may be many more revelations in this matter
 mumkin he ki dhandhe main koi doctor yaa bada aadmi bhi shaamil ho
 Joint CP RP Upadhyay of Delhi Police says that the police is not giving a clean chit to anyone in the investigation
 zarurat padi ko asapataal ke doctoron se bhi poochtacha kii jaaegi
 According to the police, the strings of this racket are spread not only in Delhi and around but also throughout the country and even abroad
 kahaan jaataa he lakhon rupaya?desh ke nami apollo aspataal main fal-phool rahe kidney racket main rupayon kii bandarbaant ne hi police ko ulajhaa diya he
 Actually, in the investigation so far, it is clear that the purchase and sale of a kidney is in the range of 20 to 25 lakh rupees
 lekin is kareed-farokht kii ek moti rakam rahasyamayi tareeqe se gaayab ho jaati thi
 This means that Donor and Middleman used to get a small portion of this amount
 jabaki resiver se vasuuli jane vaali moti rakam kaa sabase bada hissaa akhir kahaan jaataa he, philhal kisi ko nahin pataa
 And just this question has forced the police to find out the big fish of this business
 yahi vajah he ki ab police ne apollo aspataal prabandhan ko bhi sawaalon kii ek lambii fehrist saunpi he
 However, the hospital management does not want to speak on the matter on camera
 lekin usne apana bayaan zarur diya he
 Apollo Hospital statement: In this entire case, Apollo Hospital issued an official statement saying, "the police met us a day before about a kidney racket
 hamane police ko sahyog kiya
 And the police gave us the information we asked for
 hamaare yahaan jo bhi kidney transplant hoti he, wo sabhi jaruri document ke saath hi kii jaati he
 We work under a legal process, we were not aware of this incident
 pakade gaye donon pies apollo ke stoff nahin he balki doctoron ke pies he
 We want strict action from Delhi Police in this matter
 "asal main is silsile main ab tak giraftaar paanch logon main do aise hai jo apollo main doctoron ke pies ke taur par kaam karte hai
 And through them, the work of stealing kidney and selling it in Apollo was going on
 or aisa tab tha, jab organ donneton ko lekar behad kade sarkari kanoon maujuud hai
 In the last year too many kidneys were sold, many accused of this racket have said that they have removed about 12 to 15 kidneys in 2015 in Coimbatore too
 si rajkumaar raav bhi ek mastermind he andhra kaa he jo philhal faraar chal rahaa he
 In this case there are also three female donors who have sold their kidneys with money
 police ne ab tak is racket se kidney transplant ke liye zaruri kaagazat, farji voter ai card, photograph, medical report, electranik gagetts or qareeb do lakh rupye baraamad kiye hai
 At present, the raids are going on not only in Delhi, but also in many other cities of the country including Kolkata, Chennai
 police ke radar par hai doctordilli police ko joint seepi arapy upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki police kii timen kolkata or chennai ke alaava dilli ke kai ilaakon main chhapemari kar rahi hai
 The difficulty of Apollo Hospital may increase in the coming days as some more staff members and doctors of the hospital are on the police radar

 Voices are being raised against his government in the country, to deal with this, Imran wants to play every wager

 According to Dawn News report, Khan gave these instructions during a meeting with spokespersons of the government in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO)
 moulana ne imran ko chetavanee di thi agar unki sarkaar ne aazaadee march rokane kii koshish kii to puri pakistan main chakkaa jam kar diya jayega
 a spokesperson involved in a meeting with the Prime Minister on Friday said that it has been decided that the government should reach out to the JUI-F chief to find out the demands of his party and not to impede the issue

 Angry with his party, 'bhishma Pitamah' of the Bharatiya Janata Party, LK Advani has resigned from all posts in the party
 party se sabhi bade netaa unke maan-manouvval main lage hai, lekin tamaam koshishon kii baavjood adwani kii naaraazgi khatm nahin hui he
 The sources quoting the news also said that BJP is trying to convince Advani, but for this he is not ready to back down from the decision taken on Narendra Modi
 ab har kisi ke man main ek hi sawaal he, aakhir aisi kya vajah he ki narendra modi kii khatir bijepi diggaj adwani ko nazarandaaj karne ko bhi taiyaar he
 There are possible reasons for this
 aaie inhen kaarnon kii karte hai padtaalanjo lokapriy hota he vahi netaa hota hagova bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte vakt jab party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne yah kaha ki jo lokapriy hota he, vahi netaa hota he
 So his gesture was clear that now Khaiwaiah of bjp's Naiyya will be Modi
 isaki vajah he modi kii lokapriyata
 Modi has a good hold among the youth of the country as well as among the people of Gujarat
 asaadhaaran vakpatutaa kii vajah se modi middle class ke bhi hero hai
 There is tremendous enthusiasm among party workers about Modi
 aise main party ke liye unki lokapriyata ko nazarandaaj karnaa behad mushkil he
 How did the BJP go against the wishes of the RSS? The RSS played an important role behind Modi's coronation
 sangh ke dabaav ke baad hi party ne goa kaaryakarini main aanan-fanan main modi ko chunavi commander bana diya
 It has rarely happened when the BJP has gone against any direction of the Sangh, so it was not easy to change this decision
 darasal, bijepi ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main sangh ke kaaryakartaaon kii jarurat padegi
 Because the organization of the Sangh will work to create a wave for Modi in the country, which the party is looking at by combining the advantages and disadvantages
 baat vartmaan kii nahin, bhavishya kii haadwani ke party main is tarah alag-thalag padane kii vajah unki umr bhi he
 Advani is 84 years old
 aane vaale samay main raajnneeti main unki sakriyata ko lekar sanshay barkaraar he
 At the same time, the party is thinking of its future
 agar modi party kaa netritv sambhalate hai to agle 10-15 saal tak ke liye bijepi netritv kii chintaa se nijaat paa legi
 Who bet on a lame horse? In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party had to face a crushing defeat under the leadership of LK Advani
 iske baad adwani kii lokapriyata dhire-dhire ghatane lagi
 In the current political scenario, handing over the command to Advani, the party will have an electoral advantage, there is a serious question about it
 
 
 
 So that the voters do not get confused about the leader, the party wants to put a stop to the news coming in the media on the tussle about the PM candidature in the NDA
 is mudde par bijepi apana rukh saaf kar dena chaahati he
 So that the situation is clear among the voters about the face of the party in the next election
 vahiin, gathbandhan ke saathiyon ko ishaaron hi ishaaron main party ke rukh kaa khabar ho jaae
 Even though the party has made Modi the election commander, it is another strong step towards his PM candidature
 chunavi survey main bhi modi ageparty ke faisle ke peeche kuch had tak chunavi survey kii bhoomika bhi rahi hogi
 Modi is emerging as the most favored face of BJP in almost all the poll surveys
 chaahe vah piem pad ko lekar unki daavedaari ho yaa phir unhen netaa ghoshit karne ke baad bijepi kii milane vaali siton kii sthiti
 On every front, the party seems to be benefiting along with Modi
 aise main party janata ke mood ke saath janaa chaahegi

 The committee is of the view that the income tax exemption limit should be increased to Rs 3 lakh
 vidheyak main yah seemaa badhaakar 2 lakh rupee karne kaa praavdhaan he
 According to sources, the committee wants the government to raise the income tax exemption limit in view of the fast rising inflation
 vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne ditisi vidheyak ko agast main loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha jise samiksha ke liye sthaayee samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya

 a shocking case from Chandauli in Uttar Pradesh, the bull jumped on the roof of the house, felt that the earthquake hit the roof after two and a half hours of hard work
 Is, but the reality of the state tells something else
 uttar pradesh ke chandauli se ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he, jo pradesh main sandon ke aatank ko bataata he
 Here a bull jumped and reached the roof of the house, which felt as if an earthquake had occurred
 chandauli jile ke dinadayalnagar main ek building kii chat par sand kud gaya, jiske baad halchal much gai
 Immediately the family reported this to the municipality, after which the administration came to take the bull off the roof and after about two and a half hours of effort, the bull came down from the roof
 darasal, dinadayalnagar main nagarpalika offis ke bagal main palika dwaara ek shopping complex banwaaya gaya he
 The bull reached the roof of this shopping complex via stairs and instead of coming back down, jumped onto the roof of the neighborhood house
 jis vakt sand chat par kuuda to kuch log so rahe the or kuch apane kaam main lage the, lekin tabhi puraa ghar hi hill gaya or halchal tej ho gai
 The owner of the house, Shubham Jaiswal, says that when the bull jumped on the roof, there was a loud noise and the whole house came
 hamen aisa laga ki maano bukamp aa gaya ho
 After this, he immediately informed the municipality, after which the staff of the administration, after trying for two and a half hours, lowered the bull
 gauratlab he ki yogi sarkaar ke dwaara pradesh main aawaara pashuon ke liye gaushala banane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he, shaharon-gaanvon-kasbon main gaushala banaai ja rahi he
 However, there are still such cases of stray animals, which include crop damage and damage in this way

 According to the government data, there are about 600 deaths due to encephalitis i
e
 brain fever every year in Purvanchal but this issue is not an election issue for any political party
 incephelitis agar kisi bachche ko ho jaae to yaa to bachche kii maut ho jaati he or yaa phir peedit zindagi bhar ke liye viklang ho jaataa he
 We went to Maharajganj, 54 km from Gorakhpur, to meet one such child
 bachche kaa naam rajan he
 17-year-old Rajan has been in bed for the past 13 years
 2004 main unhen incephelitis hua tha
 He has been in a coma since then
 rajan ke sirahaane baithi unki maa rose apane bete kii haalat dekhakar roti hai
 According to doctors - Rajan can never be cured now
 rajan kii maa malti hamen bataatin hai ki "rajan naa to chal saktaa he na bol saktaa he

 If these politicians do a little hard work and inject children with time, then how many children can save their lives
 - purvanchal main incephelitis kaa pehla maamla 1977 main saamne aayaa - No successful treatment for encephalitis - 2014 main incephelitis par rashtriya program bana, lekin ab tak lagu nahin hua - According to government data, 600 deaths every year - bachche hote hai sabase zyada peedit tippaniyan From PM Narendra Modi to Rahul Gandhi and the Chief Minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav are all campaigning

 Terming it a 'victory of truth', the party said that Narendra Modi has emerged stronger by this decision of the court amid 11 years of propaganda by the Congress and its friend ngos
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki farji bayaanbaji saboot nahin ban sakate hai
 a fundamental difference between untruth and truth is that all facts remain together with truth, while untruth falls apart

 We have no hesitation in saying that the Congress party cannot fight any political fight against Narendra Modi, hence has been carrying out such propaganda

 lekin modi ke liye surakshit seat main party ke donon bujurgon ne hi pech fansaa di
 As soon as Modi's name came up as bjp's prime ministerial candidate, the Sangh started homework in Gandhinagar as well as Varanasi
 darasal varanasi seat se party ek tir se do nishaanaa lagaana chaahati thi
 One, Modi's victory in Varanasi seemed easy and the other was looking to strengthen his backward base with Modi's backward card in Purvanchal
 lekin sutron kii maane to joshi is baat par ad gaye hai ki wo varanasi se hi chunaav ladenge, jahaan se pichhali baar jite the

 lekin is par koi raajnneetik maathapai hoti, usase pehle hi 87 saal ke adwani ne lalakaara- ham loksabhaa ke liye ladenge
 After Advani's stern stance, a further news emerged that he could leave his traditional seat of Gandhinagar and contest from Bhopal or Indore in Madhya Pradesh

 The sourness of Modi's relationship with Advani had come at the time of pm's candidature

 In the MCD election, where the BJP has got a strong majority on one side, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have been forced to sit in the opposition on the other
 isamen bhi teenon emsidi main aam aadmi party vipaksh main ahm bhoomika main hogi, to vahiin congress ke saamne chunauti aisa cheharaa dhundne kii hogi, jo aane vaale paanch saalon tak emsidi chunaav main tisare number par rahi congress parshadon ko jode rakh sake
 The Congress has been in opposition in the MCD for the last 10 years
 north emsidi main congress ke sabase zyaada 15 parshad jite hai, jabaki south main 12 or east main sabase kam 3 parshad jite
 Guddi Devi, who is considered as the most reliable face of the Congress in the North MCD, won for the second consecutive time from Malkaganj
 mana ja rahaa he kimodi laharmein bhi guddi devi ne apni seat bachaakar alaakaman kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 Due to being a Dalit and middle class voter in the Malkaganj seat, there was a triangular fight between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party as well as the Bahujan Samaj Party, but in the last five years there should be women security or the closure of liquor contracts, water shortage in the ward Demonstrations or to have a mother-child center
 
 
 guddi devi ke inhen kaamon ne votaron main unki gahari paith bana di or vah apana kila bachaane main kaamyaab raheen
 Guddi Devi came into the limelight when she lashed out loudly to the ruling house in the absence of pension fund and got pension for widows and elders
 mana ja rahaa he ki daliton se jude muddon par guddi devi kii lagaataar ladaai ko dekhte hue congress un par daanv khel sakati he
 However Seema Tahira from Prerna and Bazaar Sita Ram, who won from Anand Parvat, are also in this race, because they too have experience of 5 years in MCD
 southamasidimen abhishek dutt congress kii pehali pasand ho sakate hai
 Dutt has won for the second time and keeps a good grip on issues related to MCD
 lihaaja unke anubhav ko dekhte hue congress un par daanv khel sakati he
 Congress may bring in a new face due to the defeat of Vyam Kaur, who was the leader of opposition in the East MCD from the Congress
 udhar aam aadmi party main lagbhag sabhi nae chehre hai, lekin north emsidi main ajmeri get se aap ke parshad rakesh kumaar kii ye duusari pari he
 Rakesh came into the limelight when he was slapped during the joint house of the three mcds at Ramlila Maidan
 uske baad raajnneeti garma gai thi or aap ke tamaam bade netaaon ne isaki ninda karte hue doshiyon par exiaar darj karne kii maang kii thi
 Looking at Rakesh's experience, you can make him the leader of the opposition
 vahiin, south or east main lagbhag sabhi nae parshadon ke kaaran koi nayaa cheharaa hi netaa vipaksh ke pad par baithne kii sambhaavna he

 GPS devices, mobile phones and other goods are being searched, it is feared that the terrorists may have hidden such things somewhere to erase evidence

 Former Chief Minister of the state Shankar Singh Vaghela, who has dominated Gujarat's politics for three decades, says that the Congress has taken bets of its defeat in the elections
 waghela ne kaha ki is baar congress kahin nahin tikegi
 On Hardik Patel, he said that he will become history after this election
 bhaajapa main jane kii atakalon ko unhone khaarij karte hue kaha ki chunaav main jeet camel kii hi hogi
 BJP will get a majority of votes, saying that Congress is deliberately losing to BJP
 bhaajapa ko rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main bahumat milegaa
 Vaghela, who quit the Congress this year, believes that the central leadership of the main opposition party has taken a 'supari' from the BJP to lose the assembly elections and declared that the ruling BJP would win a clear majority in the state assembly elections
 chah baar ke saansad waghela ne chunaav se kuch maheene pehle apana sanghathanjan vikalp morchabanane ke liye congress chodi thi
 He will become history after the election, he also claimed that Patidar leader Hardik Patel will become 'history' after this election
 waghela alag-alag samay main rajya main congress or bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 He said in an interview to news agency Bhasha that people like him only serve their interests
 aap dekhenge ki ek baar chunaav samaapt ho jane ke baad vah itihaas ban jaaenge
 The 77-year-old Vaghela, who played an active role in state politics for more than three decades, said that if the Congress had already started preparing for it, it could have won the election
 to 90 seat jeet sakati thi congressunhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa gujarat main majboot sanghathan he or party kaaryakartaaon kaa bada aadhaar he
 If you have to challenge them, then you need to start the ground work at least six months before the election
 waghela ne kaha ki unhone congress netaa rahul gandhi se kaha tha ki party 90 se adhik siten jeet sakati he or sarkaar banane main sakasham ho sakati he
 Vaghela was the chief minister of the state from 1996 to 1997
 waghela ne kaha ki maine unhen yah bhi spasht kiya ki main mukhyamantri nahin bananaa chahta hum
 He also assured me that he is my friend in Delhi and will help me in running the party in the state
 unhone daawa kiya ki party aalaa kaman main kuch netaa nahin chaahate hai ki party chunaav jite
 He was very vicious in BJP political management, he said that the leaders under the central leadership of the Congress have taken betel from the BJP to lose elections in Gujarat
 ve chunaav jeet sakate the
 He claimed that the BJP would get more than 110 seats and form the government in the state
 unhone kaha ki yah congress ke liye chunaav jeetne kaa sarvshereshth avasar ho saktaa tha kyonki log maukey kii talash kar rahe the
 Vaghela said that BJP is very vicious in political management and Congress did not do the ground work and ignored that fact
 bijepi ne bete ko tikat kii peshkash kii thivaghela ne bhaajapa main waapas jane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar kiya
 He said that the party had offered my son a ticket, but he turned it down
 isaliye koi sawaal hi nahin he
 He said that he will not contest the election

 ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan par vishwa hindu parishad (VHP) ne bada faisla liya he
 The VHP has halted the Ram temple construction campaign for four months
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke sampann hone tak viechpi ram mandir mudde par kisi tarah kaa koi abhiyaan nahin chalaane kaa nirnay kiya he, kyonki vah nahin chahta he ki ram mandir maamla chunavi mudda bane
 While saints and saints had passed the resolution in the meeting of the Dharmasabha at Kumbh, they said that they will not sit peacefully till the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya sanyukt mahasachiv surendra jain ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki viechpi ne faisla kiya he ki ayodhya ram mandir nirmaan ke liye chal rahe abhiyaan ko loksabhaa chunaav tak nahin chalaaya jayega
 We do not want this to be an election issue, because the Ram temple is associated with faith and purity
 surendra jain ne kaha ki aksar hamaare upar aarope lagate hai kisi vishesh dal ko raajnneetik phayda ke liye ram mandir nirmaan kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, we do not want to implicate this issue in any political party
 ye ek pavitra mudda he ise ham raajnneeti se pare rakhana chaahate hai
 Whenever there is any movement during the Lok Sabha elections, it is associated with politics
 isiilie hamane faisla kiya he ki ise ham chaar maheene tak koi andolan nahin chalaayenge
 He said that the second major reason for stopping the Ram temple movement is that the code of conduct comes into force in the country with the election announcement
 aise main kisi tarah ke andolan se anaavashyak rup se sangharsh or vivaad kaa nirmaan hote hai
 Therefore, while deciding to honor this festival of democracy, the VHP has decided that we should not fall into any dispute and not obstruct the violation of the code of conduct
 isi ko dekhte hue ram mandir abhiyaan ko chaar maheene tak rokane kaa faisla kiya he
 Explain that the case related to the Ram temple-babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya is going on in the court in 1950
 elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bench ne 30 sitambar, 2010 main faisla diya tha
 The High Court had ruled to divide the disputed land into three parts
 court ne teenon pakshon ramalala virajman, nirmohi akhaada or sunni vakf board main 2
 He was ordered to distribute 77 acres of land equally
 iske baad donon pakshakaron ne hai court ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di, tab se ye maamla desh kii sabase badi adaalat main he
 The Supreme Court is hearing a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi

 a post shared by Simmran k Mundi (@simrankaurmundi) on Jul 2, 2018 at 6:59 am PDT 31 varshiya mahila par ek naaballig ladke kaa kathith rup se yon shoshan karne or blackmel karne ke aarope main maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Police said the woman used to teach tuition to the boy
 police ne bataaya ki peedit aathvin class kaa chaatr he or uskaa parivaar jis makaan main kiraye par rahata tha, vah aaropee mahila ke pita kaa he
 He said the woman allegedly pressurized the 14-year-old boy to have a physical relationship
 mahila ne ladke ko dhamkee di ki agar usne uski maang puri nahin kii, to use maar daalegi
 SHO Dharampal said that the woman made a video and started blackmailing the boy
 unhone kaha ki yah silsilaa kai maheene tak jari rahaa
 The victim later reported the entire case to his father, who contacted the police
 police ne kaha ki mahila ke khilaaf protection of children from sexual offenses act 2012 (POCSO Act) ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 He said that the accused is absconding

 --- from input language france ke adhikariyon ke saamne samudr tat ke kinare pade ek whale kaa shav pareshaani kaa sabab bana hua he
 Gas is being filled in the carcass of this 15 tonne whale, which can cause it to explode at any time
 vanyajeev visheshgyon ne chetaya he ki iske aasapaas koi bhi na jaae or jald iskaa koi samaadhaan nikaala jaae
 At present, the authorities have closed the entire coast and refused people to go there
 is samasya ke liye ab adhikariyon ne ise dynamite se blast karne kaa nirnay liya he
 In the video of one such case of last year, it can be seen how dangerous the carcass of a whale is and it can also harm someone
 whale kaa shav bumadhya sagar ke tat main montpiler ke paas cents-mairi-di-laa-mer main number ke shuruaati dinon main bahakar aa gaya
 Annis Chiron, project manager at the National Reserve of Camarg, said, "due to the heat, gas is produced inside the carcass of the whale
" isse sharir phulataa rahata he or kisi bhi vakt fatne kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 He said that the whale could be blasted out of the sea using dynamite, but due to the sand, the boat would not come very close to it
 doosraa tarika ye ho saktaa he ki ise vine main chadhaane se pehle tukdon main kaat liya jaae
 Last year too, the body of a whale was bit by the biologist with a sharp touch, but at the same time the full blood and flesh came out into the air with a sharp blow
