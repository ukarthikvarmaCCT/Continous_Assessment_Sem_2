 Before Prime Minister Modi's visit to Patna, veteran BJP leader and MP from Patna Sahib, Shatrughan Sinha raised his finger directly on the PMO for not calling himself to the program
 ajtak ko die gaye exclusive intervyuu main sinha ne kaha ki kuch log unke damdaar kad or lokapriy chhavi se ghabaraate hai
 That is why they are not called
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 14 oktober ko patna vishvavidhyalay ke swarna shatabdi samaaroh main hissaa lenge
 Here are the key parts of this special conversation with Shatrughan Sinha - The mood of the country is changing
 jiesti, usase pehle notebandi, phir arthvyavastha kaa jo haal he or berogari se lekar tamaam masalon par janata kaa mizaaz badal rahaa he
 If Yashwant Sinha showed a mirror to the government, it was in the interest of our party
 yah hamaare desh hit main tha par unki baat ko galat dhang se liya gaya
 Shatrughan Sinha, while not commenting on Shalya, Dushasan or Duryodhana in the battle of two elephants, said that this is a battle of two big people and does not want to become grass in the battle of two elephants
 par hamaare vitt mantri ji ne aisi baat kahi ki yashavanth sinha naukari maang rahe hai
 Do they not know that Yashwant Sinha has presented the budget of the country 7 times
 vah itane gyani hai ki abhi kuch logon ko kai janm lenaa padegaa, unki tarah banane ke liye
 He left the government job, he had 14 years left
 unhone koun-si naukari ke liye applai kiya ek baar kaagaj-patr to dikhaaiye
 To be honest, questions are raised on the intention
 Sometimes i am also questioned that he has not been made a minister, so he is talking like this
 yah log jo kah rahe hai inke paas koi chaara nahin he
 The first thing is, why did the minister not make me? Is my performance bad? Is the image bad? Has anyone been accused of corruption? i want to become a sentry of the country, if i had to become a minister, i would have kept quiet
 na ichha he, na apeksha he mantri banane kii
 The BJP is the first and the last party
 haa yah jarur he ki jo party hit main,desh hit main hoga, vah jarur boluungaa
 Whether i become a minister or not, i will definitely become an orange in the state
 bihar main bihari babu ko nahin bulaayaa jataave baar-baar upeksha karte hai
 This has become a very old thing, it is not happening for the first time
 mujhe shatabdi samaaroh main patna nahin bulaayaa gaya
 From leaders to mlas, ministers all come, not just invite or invite me
 kuch log mere damdaar kad se ghabaraate haidrasal kuch logon kii ghabrahat or baukhalaahat he
 Nor do i get any punishment, in fact i do not have any position, some people are afraid of my height, because my height is very strong
 meri lokapriyata or meri chhavi se ghabaraate hai
 There is a clean image
 main ek acha vaktaa hum
 There are some innocent people who feel that if i am present then i will take all the charm, i will become a towering personality
 unako lagata he ki inhen dur rakho
 i am ready to go, our Prime Minister is going to Patna University
 merotikat bhibuk tha, main soch rahaa tha ki jaaoongaa
 The condition of Patna University is so bad

 vidhayak ne pokharial par bahari hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki haridwar kii janata sthaneey ummidavaar chaahati he, jo vahaan ki sthaneey janata ke bich se ho
 Now Congress has also taken up this issue against them
 vipaksh ke sawaalon kaa nishank ne bhi karaara jawaab diya or apane bahari hone ke aarope par nishank ne kaha ki ye baat jisane bhi pehle uthaai he, unki jamaanat jabt hui he
 He said that in 2009, the opposition contested the same thing
 ye ghatiya kism ke hatkande wo log uthaate hai, jinka na mishan hota he or na vijan hota he or na hi lokapriy hote hai
 They only run their own shop
 aise nimna or ghatiya soch ke logon ko janata is baar phir sabak sikhayegi or jamaanat jabt karavaaegi
 Even when former Chief Minister Harish Rawat first fought Haridwar and later moved to Nainital, Nishank quipped and said that he sincerely wanted Harish Rawat to contest from Haridwar, then he too would have enjoyed contesting because Harish Rawat Congress Is a big leader of vahiin paudi seat se saansad rahe khanduri ke putr manish khanduri congress se ummidavaar hai
 When Nishank was asked if the Khanduri camp would be able to stay with the BJP, he said that Khanduri ji has been a BJP MP from Pauri, and Khanduri has said that he is with the BJP, and the party has given me a lot and i i will promote my party

 Katrina is soon to launch the massive Dhoom-3 title song in front of everyone
 dhooma-3 kaa bhi tital geet vahi he jo dhooma ke pehle or duusare bhaag main thah dhooma machaa le
 More work has been done on the same song and it is believed that it is better than the title songs of the first two parts
 dhooma-1 main jahaan tital geet par isha deol thirakati nazar ai thim or usee ke saath us geet kaa ek rimix bhi bana tha jo tata yang par filmaaya gaya tha, vahin dhooma 2 main tital geet main aishwarya raay or ruthik raushan ne jam kar dhooma machaai thi
 The song was a huge hit and perhaps due to this there was also some pressure on Katrina to make it a better and bigger hit than before
 is geet main katrina ne jabardast parformens diya he
 Looking at Katrina's hot style in the trailer itself, it can be guessed how powerful she will look in her upcoming song
 sunne main aayaa he ki is gane ke liye katrina ghanton mehnat karti thi or jis kisi ne bhi is gane ko dekha he wo unki tarif karte thak nahin rahaa he

 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne himachal pradesh main sirmaur jile ke rajgad kii raily main kaha, ''main ek baat saaf kar duun
 BJP is contesting in the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in Himachal Pradesh under the leadership of Prem Kumar Dhumal
 chunaav main ve hi hamaara cheharaa hai
 "he said," Dhumalji is the former Chief Minister and leader of the opposition, after December 18, he will be the Chief Minister
 "twitor par pradhanmantri modi ne shah kii ghoshnaa kii pushti kar di
 The BJP finally got a face for the Chief Minister's post in Himachal
 9 november ko hone vaale matdaan se pehle bamushkil hakrate bhar prachaar kaa vakt shesh he, to rajya bhaajapa ke kai netaaon samet adhiktar logon ko lag rahaa he ki ghoshnaa karne main kaaphi deree ho gai
 According to sources, BJP President Amit Shah received a phone call from Shimla in the late evening of October 30 asking the Prime Minister to implement Plan-2 (ie declaring the Chief Ministerial candidate) for the election in Himachal
 phir, shah ne dhumal ko phone kar turant shimla bulaayaa
 Dhumal reached Shimla very quickly from Hamirpur
 shah ne unase kaha ki party kaa faisla he ki mukhyamantri pratyaashee ghoshit karnaa badi jeet ke liye jaruri he, haalanki yah jaahir nahin hone diya ki pratyaashee koun hoga
 The next day, on October 31, when Dhumal was campaigning in Jwalamukhi, at the same rally in Shahgarh, Shah announced Dhumal's name
 bhaashan main shah ne yah bhi bataaya ki bhaajapa ne plan-2 kyon apanaaya
 He said, "in Himachal, Congress was constantly asking who is the CM candidate of BJP?" a senior BJP leader cites internal assessment of the party in which Congress is considered strong
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''bhaajapa kii jeet chunaav main pakki thi lekin hamane virbhadra singh or congress ko majboot hone kaa mauka de diya
 "modi and Shah took so long to announce Dhumal's name, while Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had made Virbhadra Singh clear as the next chief minister of the party long before the election notification on October 12
 dhumal ke naam se bhaajapa ke bheetar jaisaa kautuhal paidaa hua he, vah bataata he ki aam taur se suniyojit ranneeti ke hisaab se kaam karne vaale shah ne unka chayan kisi ranneeti ke aadhaar par nahin, balki sthaneey ganit ke lihaaj se majaboor hokar kiya
 It is shocking to declare 73-year-old Dhumal as the CM candidate without agreeing to a formal meeting of the party's parliamentary board
 duusare, is maamle main 70 varsh kii ayusima kii shart ko bhi tod diya gaya he
 Mission 2019 is the reason for the party to take decisions away from these actions
 bhaajapa netaaon ke mutabik dikhaanaa yah he ki modi kii lokapriyata na sirf barkaraar he balki usamen jabardast ijapha hua he
 Dhumal has also expressed confidence of winning 60 seats from the Mission 50 in the 68-member Assembly after being declared a candidate
 iske pehle vitt mantri arun jetali jab 29 aktubar ko shimla main chunavi ghoshnaptr jari kar rahe the, party ke aalaa netaa mukhyamantri ke chehre ke bataur kisi naam kii ghoshnaa na kiye ko lekar party netritv kaa bachaav kar rahe the or ise ''ranneetik maamla" bataa rahe the
 Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda was considered to be Dhumal's close rival for the post
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki dhumal kaa chayan bhaajapa ke liye phydemand rahegaa
 Dhumal is also fit in terms of caste equation (rajput)
 rajya kii aabaadi main kareeb 36 fisadi thakur hai
 Virbhadra Singh of Congress is also Thakur
 aise main shanta kumaar yaa jepi nadda jaise brahman chehre ko siem pratyaashee banane se jati ganit gadabada saktaa tha
 Brahmins are around 18 percent
 lekin 31 aktubar ko shah kii ghoshnaa se virbhadra ke utsaah par fark nahin padaa he
 His supporters say that the rivalry between Dhumal and Nadda's supporters will be revealed
 ve yah bhi kah rahe hai ki kangra kii 15 siton par prabhaav rakhane vaale bhaajapa ke bujurg netaa shantakumar bhi dhumal ke chayan se khush nahin honge
 However, the result of the state one-phase voting will come on 18 December
 tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kiskaa daanv kitna sahi he

 Researchers at the University of Montreal-based Canada found that when teenagers decreased their use of social media, television, and computers, they also had fewer symptoms of stress
 haalia adhyayan main shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki soshal media ke istemaal or televijan dekhne kaa sambandh avsaad ke lakshanon se he

 kaaryakartaaon se apanepan kaa vyavhaar The Election Commission has given a strong shock to the BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main prachaar ke liye banaae gaye theme song par bijepi ne roak laga di he
 The song was composed by BJP to woo voters in West Bengal
 is gane ko pashchim bengal ke asanasol se bijepi saansad or kendriya mantri babul supriyo ne taiyaar kiya he
 Let me tell you that the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal had filed a complaint in the Election Commission against the song, which claimed that the song sung and composed by singer Babul Supriyo was released on social media without certification
 chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki bijepi dwaara jari kiya gaya theme song purv pramanit nahin tha
 According to the Election Commission, this song was being played in many places without permission, so this song has been banned
 pichley maheene chunaav ayog ne is maamle main kendriya mantri babul supriyo ko kaaran bataao notice bhi jari kiya tha
 The Election Commission did not allow the song to be played in two BJP rallies held on 3 April in West Bengal
 chunaav ayog ne mamata banerjee ko bhi diya javabachunaav ayog ne pashchim bengal main IPS afasaron ke transfar ko lekar mamata banerjee ke patr kaa jawaab diya he
 The Election Commission has said that the Commission has always been taking such decisions for free and fair voting
 bataa den ki chunaav ayog ne kolkata police kamishnar anuj sharma sahit chaar ipies adhikariyon ke tabadalaa kar diya tha
 Mamata Banerjee in her letter called the Election Commission's decision unfortunate, highly arbitrary, motivated and biased and asked the Election Commission to consider its decision
 mamata banerjee ne aarope lagaaya tha ki chunaav ayog ne bijepi ke ishaare par ye tabadale kiye hai
 Mamta Banerjee had also said in the letter that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister had given a statement in a TV show that the law and order situation in Bengal is bad and that is why elections have been ordered in 7 phases
 aaj kuchbihar main piem kii ralimmata banerjee ke saath siyaasi takaraav ke bich aaj pashchim bengal ke kuchbihar main piem modi kii raily he

 In the election season, the Congress has been besieging the BJP over the Rafale issue
 ab maamla supreme court main he
 The Congress is saying in its manifesto that if it comes to power, it will investigate the Rafale deal, but there is a village in one corner of the country which is upset with Rafael's stance
 haalanki is gaanv main kai log aise hai jo is baat se hi khush hai ki kam se kam rafel jahaaj ke bahaane unke gaanv kaa naam bhi puri duniya main mashhoor ho rahaa he
 In the journey of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, till today, the Naxalite affected state reached a village in Chhattisgarh, whose name is Rafael
 ghotaale se joda jaataa he naam, isliye acha nahin lagatachhattisgarh ke rafel gaanv main aaj tak kii team pahunchi to vahaan maujuud sachin or sandip camera dekhakar ruk gaye
 When they came near in curiosity, the team asked them how they felt when the name of their village was discussed
 sachin ne kaha 'rafel vimaan ke naam kii vajah se hamaare gaanv kaa naam lagaataar tivi par aa rahaa he
 This name is associated with the scam, which we do not like ', Sandeep said that after the discussion of Rafael, the media people are coming to our village
 ye hamen acha lagata he
 The village is situated in the Mahasamund Lok Sabha constituency of Chhattisgarh
 The small village of Rafael is situated in the Mahasamund Lok Sabha constituency of Chhattisgarh on the border of Chhattisgarh and Orissa
 is gaanv main rafel banane kii factory nahin he, lekin yahaan majdoor eent banaate jarur dikhaai denge
 The politics of the Rafale deal may have changed, but the picture of this village has not changed
 haalanki pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat gaanv ko single len kii pakki sadak mil gai he
 There is also a government shop for selling food grains in the village before entry
 berogari or pani he bada muddyaha ke bijepi kaaryakarta vivekanand kaa kahana he ki unke gaanv main vikaas hua he
 However, the problem of water and unemployment is the biggest issue for this village
 vivekanand kaa kahana he 'gaanv main sadak-bijli he, lekin pine kaa pani abhi tak nahin he or ham jaise yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar badi samasya he
 Meanwhile, speaking on the name of the village, Dhaneshwar said that in this village neither a bomb is made nor Rafael is made, but we feel good that our village is being named in America and other countries on the same excuse
 kuch log aise bhi hai jinka kahana he ki ab to unhen is baat par fakr he
 The village's old soldier Suresh Kumar is older than the Rafale controversy and he feels that his village is getting negative publicity due to the allegations against Rafael
 suresh kumaar kehete hai ki hamaare gaanv kaa naam to purana he, lekin rafel vimaan ko lekar ke jo charchaa ho rahi he uski vajah se naam kharaab ho rahaa he
 The sarpanch of the village also says that the paddy crop in this area is dependent on rain because of water shortage
 dhaniram rafel gaanv ke sarpanch he or unhen bhi pataa he ki achaanak unke gaanv main log kyon aa rahe hai
 However, the sarpanch of the village is also concerned about the water problem

 The Indian Cricket Board has finally given up its tough stand on the use of technology in cricket
 bisisiai isisi vashirk baithak main apni sharton par vivadaspad nirnay samiksha pranali (diares) ke sanshodhit swaroop ko sabhi antarrashtriya maichon main anivaary rup se lagu karne par sahamat ho gaya he
 The revised format of DRS was unanimously approved by the ICC Chief Executive Committee (CEC) on the second day of the meeting
 isamen hot spot technology to hogi lekin isamen hoque ai nahin hogi jisase gend kii disha kaa pataa chalata he
 This means that the DRS will not include LBW decisions
 diares ke anivaary niyam or sharton main ab ‘thermal imaging’ or ‘sound technology’ shaamil hogi
 The 'child tracker', which was earlier used to find the direction of the ball, was also included in it but it has been agreed to remove it
 diares ke naye swaroop ko isisi siisi ne kaaryakari board ke paas manjuuri ke liye bhej diya he jo kal is par antim muhar lagayegaa
 The hot spot, which is a 'thermal imaging technology', will now be available in cricket matches and has been made mandatory in DRS
 inkaa upyog mukhya rup se kareebi kaich or balle kaa kinaaraa lekar jane vaali gend ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The BCCI said that it has agreed to the revised DRS which would have hot spots but not a ball tracker

 The board's secretary and future chairman n Srinivasan said in a statement, "the BCCI has agreed to incorporate technology in the decision-making system
 isamen inphra red camere or audio trekking upkaran shaamil hai
 "according to the statement," BCCI has always expressed a desire to adopt technology for the good of the game
 haalanki vartmaan kii ball trekking technology, jis par ki diares aadhaarit he, ‘board ko sweekaarya nahin he
 'the BCCI said,' The ICC CEC meeting in Hong Kong supported the bcci's view
 siisi ne iske saath nirnay lene ke liye gend kii disha kaa pataa lagane ke liye technology ke upyog kaa bhi faisla kiya lekin yah bhagidaar tiimon ke bich dwipaksheeya vyavastha par nirbhar karegaa
 "according to the statement," the CEC has approved the recommendations of the Cricket Committee to reduce the number of unsuccessful referrals from two to one
 ’ is faisle kaa matlab he ki bharat 2008 ke baad pehali baar dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa main phir se diares ke upyog karne par sahamat hua he
 This way it will be used in India's tour of England
 haalanki is shrinkhalaa main yah hoque ai bal trekar ke bina upyog kiya jayega jiskaa matlab he ki isamen elbeadblyoo ke faisle shaamil nahin honge
 The Cricket Board of India has been opposing DRS since the beginning
 uskaa maananaa he ki yah shat pratishat sahi nahin he
 Senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar also said that it would be more acceptable if hot spots technology is included in DRS

 Along with making the loan easier for the farmers in the country, there has been talk of arrangement of 9 lakh crores on this side
 jabaki fasal beemaa ke liye 5500 karod rupee kaa aavanton he

 We have focused on a new sector and that is the personal sector
 Public sector, Private sector or Personal sector
 For India, the personal sector means that individual enterprise, which has micro finance, innovation, new movement like start-up

 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives

 Since the independence of India, we have cherished the dream of freedom from poverty

 Education and Skill Development is our priority

 garibon ko milane vaale laabh sidhe khate main pahunch rahe he
 The ambitious scheme is going ahead for the poor to get direct benefits of insurance schemes
 bharat main bahut kam logon ke paas pension suvidha he
 Pension facilities have been extended to the poor, hence the work of expansion of pension schemes
 aaj garib se garib vyakti main garibi ke khilaaf ladaai ladane kii umang jaagi he
 The belief that dreams come true has arisen in the minds of citizens

 There is either discussion of public sector or discussion of private sector

 Public sector, Private sector and Personal sector
 bharat ke liye Personal sector kaa matlab he ki individual enterprise, jisamen micro finance ho, innovation ho, start-up kii tarah nayaa movement ho
 Housing, electricity, water, education, health and sanitation are our priority for all
 ye sabhi ek garimamay jivan ke liye anivaary hai
 a concrete plan and a fixed time frame have been set to achieve these goals

 In which we have made 'beti Bachao - Beti Padhao' the mantra of house to house
 ham apane kheton ko adhik upjau tathaa bazaar se acchhee tarah se judaa hua bana rahe hai
 Also, several steps are being taken to reduce the risks of farmers due to natural uncertainties
 ham manufacturing ko revive kar rahe hai, service sector main sudhaar kar rahe hai
 We are investing at an unprecedented level in the field of infrastructure and developing our cities as smart, sustainable and vibrant development centers
 samraddhi kii ore jane kaa hamaara maarg sustainable ho, iske liye ham katibaddh he
 The root of this commitment is definitely linked to our tradition and culture

 Sustainable development is a matter of national responsibility for all countries

 Today we are here at the United Nations, because we all recognize that international partnership must be at the center of all our efforts
 phir chaahe yah development ho yaa climate change kii chunauti ho
 The principle of our collective efforts is common but differentiated responsibilities
 agar ham climate change kii chintaa karte he to kahi na kahi hamaare nijee sukh ko surakshit karne kii bu aati he
 But if we talk about climate justice, then a sensitive resolution to protect the poor in natural calamities emerges
 Climate change kii chunauti se nipatane main un samaadhaanon par bal dene kii aavashyaktaa he jinase ham apane uddeshyon ko praapt karne main safal ho saken
 We must build a global public partnership
 jiske bal par technology, innovation or finance kaa upyog karte hue ham clean or renewable energy ko sarv sulabh bana saken
 We also need to change our lifestyle, so that our dependence on energy is reduced and we move towards sustainable consumption
 saath hi ek Global Education Programme shuru karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Which prepares our next generation for the protection and promotion of nature
 main aashaa karata hoon ki viksit desh development or climate change ke liye apni vittiya patibaddhtaon ko puraa karenge, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 i also hope that the technology facilitation mechanism will be successful in making technology and innovation the medium of welfare of the world
 yah maatr nijee laabh tak simit nahin rah jaayenge
 As we are seeing, challenges are not relieved due to distance
 sudur deshon main chal rahe sangharsh or abhaav kii chaaya se bhi ve uth khadi ho sakati hai
 The whole world is connected to each other, dependent on each other and related to each other
 isliye hamaari antarrashtriya saanjhedaarion ko bhi puri maanavtaa ke kalyaan ko apane centre main rakhana hoga
 Reform is also mandatory in the United Nations, including the Security Council
 taaki isaki vishwasaneeyata tathaa auchity bana rahaa sake
 Also, we will be able to achieve our objectives more effectively through wider representation
 ham ek aise vishwa kaa nirmaan karen jahaan prayek jeev maatr surakshit mahasoos kare, use avasar uplabdh hon or sammaan mili
 Let us leave our environment in an even better condition for our future generations
 nishchit rup se isse adhik mahaan koi or uddeshy nahin ho saktaa
 But it is also true that no objective is more challenging than this
 aaj 70 varsh kii aayu ke sanyukt raashtra main ham sab se apeksha he ki ham apane vivek, anubhav, udaartaa, sahrudayata, kaushal evam takneekee ke madhyam se is chunauti par vijay praapt karen

 isi mangal kaamana ke saath aap sab kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad! • Large scale tree planting program • koyale par vishesh tex Improvement in transport system • shaharon or nadiyon kii safai
 • Waste to wealth movement maanavtaa ke chathe hisse kaa sustainable development samast vishwa ke liye tathaa hamaari sundar vasundhara ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Surely this world will be a world with fewer challenges and wider expectations
 jo apni safalataa ko lekar adhik aashwast hogi
 We will share our success and resources with others
 bhartiya parampara main puure vishwa ko ek parivaar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 "udarcharitnam Naam Tu Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" udaar buddhi waalon ke liye to sampoorn sansar ek parivaar hota he, kutumb he Today, India is discharging its responsibility as a development partner with small island states located in the Atlantic Ocean from Asia and Africa and the Pacific Ocean
 Sustainable development sabhi deshon ke liye rashtriya uttardaayitv kaa vishay he
 They also require options for policy formulation
 aaj ham yahan sanyukt raashtra main isliye hai, kyonki ham sabhi yah maanate hai ki antarrashtriya saajhedaari anivaary rup se hamaare sabhi prayaason ke centre main honi chahie
 Whether it is development or climate change challenge
 hamaare samuhik prayaason kaa siddhant he – common but differentiated responsibilities
 If we worry about climate change, then somewhere there is the smell of securing our personal happiness
 lekin yadi ham climate justice kii baat karte he to garibo ko practik aapadaao main surakshit rakhane kaa ek samvedansheel sankalp ubhar kar aata he
 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives
 hamen ek vaishvik jan-bhagidaari kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of which we can make clean and renewable energy accessible by using technology, innovation and finance
 hamen apni jeevanstyli main bhi badlaav karne kii aavashyaktaa he, taaki urja par hamaari nirbharta kam ho or ham sustainable consumption kii ore bade
 There is also a need to start a Global Education Program
 jo hamaari agali peedi ko prakruti ke rakshan evam sanvardhan ke liye taiyaar kare
 i hope that developed countries will fulfill their financial commitments for development and climate change, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 main yah bhi aashaa karata hoon ki technology facilitation mechanism, technology or innovation ko vishwa ke kalyaan kaa madhyam banane main safal hoga
 It will not be limited to private profit alone
 jaisaa ki ham dekh rahe hai, duuri ke kaaran chunautiyon se chhutkaaraa nahin he
 They can also stand up from the shadow of ongoing conflict and absence in remote countries
 samoochaa vishwa ek dusre se judaa he, ek dusre par nirbhar he or ek dusre se sambandhit he
 Therefore, our international partnerships also have to keep the welfare of the entire humanity at the center
 suraksha parishad samet sanyukt raashtra main bhi sudhaar anivaary he
 So that it can maintain its reliability and justification
 saath hi vyapak pratinidhitiv ke dwaara ham apane uddeshyon kii prapti adhik prabhavi rup se kar sakenge
 Let us create a world where every living being just feels safe, has opportunities and is respected
 ham apni bhavi peedi ke liye apane paryaavaran ko or bhi behatar sthiti main chhod kar jaaen
 Surely there could be no greater purpose than this
 parantu yah bhi sach he kii koi bhi uddeshy isse adhik chunauteepurn bhi nahin he
 Today, at the age of 70, all of us in the United Nations are expected to overcome this challenge through our wisdom, experience, generosity, warm-heartedness, skill and technology
 mujhe drudh vishwaas he ki ham aisa kar sakenge

 aaj bharat, asia tathaa africa or prashanth mahaasaagar se atlantic mahaasaagar main sthit chote chote Island States ke saath development partner ke rup main apane daayitv kaa nirvahan kar rahaa he
 Sustainable development is a matter of national responsibility for all countries
 saath hi unhen niti nirdhaaran ke liye vikalpon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Today we are here at the United Nations, because we all recognize that international partnership must be at the center of all our efforts
 phir chaahe yah development ho yaa climate change kii chunauti ho
 The principle of our collective efforts is common but differentiated responsibilities
 agar ham climate change kii chintaa karte he to kahi na kahi hamaare nijee sukh ko surakshit karne kii bu aati he
 But if we talk about climate justice, then a sensitive resolution to protect the poor in natural calamities emerges
 Climate change kii chunauti se nipatane main un samaadhaanon par bal dene kii aavashyaktaa he jinase ham apane uddeshyon ko praapt karne main safal ho saken
 We must build a global public partnership
 jiske bal par technology, innovation or finance kaa upyog karte hue ham clean or renewable energy ko sarv sulabh bana saken
 We also need to change our lifestyle, so that our dependence on energy is reduced and we move towards sustainable consumption
 saath hi ek Global Education Programme shuru karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Which prepares our next generation for the protection and promotion of nature
 main aashaa karata hoon ki viksit desh development or climate change ke liye apni vittiya patibaddhtaon ko puraa karenge, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 i also hope that the technology facilitation mechanism will be successful in making technology and innovation the medium of welfare of the world
 yah maatr nijee laabh tak simit nahin rah jaayenge
 As we are seeing, challenges are not relieved due to distance
 sudur deshon main chal rahe sangharsh or abhaav kii chaaya se bhi ve uth khadi ho sakati hai
 The whole world is connected to each other, dependent on each other and related to each other
 isliye hamaari antarrashtriya saanjhedaarion ko bhi puri maanavtaa ke kalyaan ko apane centre main rakhana hoga
 Reform is also mandatory in the United Nations, including the Security Council
 taaki isaki vishwasaneeyata tathaa auchity bana rahaa sake
 Also, we will be able to achieve our objectives more effectively through wider representation
 ham ek aise vishwa kaa nirmaan karen jahaan prayek jeev maatr surakshit mahasoos kare, use avasar uplabdh hon or sammaan mili
 Let us leave our environment in an even better condition for our future generations
 nishchit rup se isse adhik mahaan koi or uddeshy nahin ho saktaa
 But it is also true that no objective is more challenging than this
 aaj 70 varsh kii aayu ke sanyukt raashtra main ham sab se apeksha he ki ham apane vivek, anubhav, udaartaa, sahrudayata, kaushal evam takneekee ke madhyam se is chunauti par vijay praapt karen

 Sustainable development sabhi deshon ke liye rashtriya uttardaayitv kaa vishay he

 aaj ham yahan sanyukt raashtra main isliye hai, kyonki ham sabhi yah maanate hai ki antarrashtriya saajhedaari anivaary rup se hamaare sabhi prayaason ke centre main honi chahie

 lekin yadi ham climate justice kii baat karte he to garibo ko practik aapadaao main surakshit rakhane kaa ek samvedansheel sankalp ubhar kar aata he
 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives

 *** a post shared by shaikh (@ shadabshaikh1200) on Mar 26, 2018 at 12:50 pm PDT ashok or prakaash ne abhishek bachchan or rani mukherjee kii charchit film banty or bubbly nahin dekhi thi, lekin donon ne bakhubi yah jaan liya ki unhen kisi ko shikaar bananaa he to mahila sahyogi unka kaam aasaan karegi
 In such a situation, Ashok made the married queen a companion, while Prakash married unmarried Maneka alias Maina
 ek joda bason or railgadiyon main yatriyon visheshkar vruddh mahilaon ko behosh kar luutata, doosraa alag-alag dukaanon se mahange kapade churaataa
 Now both couples are regretful after coming back, but after coming out, they will not start this series again, no one will be ready to guarantee it
 ganganagar police ke vishesh daste ne yahaan ke bas stand par 28 varshiya ashok or 22 saal kii rani urf rinku dabocha, us samay ve ek vriddha sukhpal cor ko nashili dawa pilaakar behoshee kii haalat main laa chuke the or uskaa keemtee saamaan paar karne hi vaale the
 Drug pills and a medicine were also found from him
 aam taur par vruddh sahyatri ko vishwaas main lene ke liye yah yugal uske gaanv kaa pataa poochta or phir khud bhi usee gaanv main ja rahe hone kii baat kehete hue baton main fans letaa
 Both are residents of Fazilka Tehsil in Punjab, but they carried out all the incidents on the way to Ganganagar or Rajasthan
 aisa karne kii vajah?ashok se suniye, ''yahaan ke log bhole hote hai or phir hamen yahaan koi pahachaanata bhi nahin
 Both of them confessed to half a dozen incidents
 yatriyon ko behosh karne vaali unki dawa khatm hi hone vaali thi
 This medicine was given to him by a man who described himself as a monk on the train while coming from Haridwar
 police ke sahaayak up nireekshak vijay thalod kehete hai, ''dawa khatm hone ke baad in donon ko pakad paanaa shaayad mumkin hi nahin hota
 "when the hitchhiker was dark, the queen would call herself her daughter, if the color was clear, Ashok would pretend to be his son
" aise main anya yatriyon ko donon par shaq hi nahin hota
 With the proceeds from the incident, the two bought ration house water and Ashok took a motorcycle
 kuch jevar bhi police ne baraamad kar liye hai
 Prakash and Maina were also no less vicious
 kai din tak dargiyon kii dukaanon par ghoomane ke baad prakaash ne premika maina ko mahange suut dene kii sochi, phir kamyaabi milti rahi, to dukaanon se paar kiye hue suut logon ko bechney shuru kar die
 Prakash used to pretend to the shopkeeper, Manna would pretend to like the suit and would get several suits in an empty bag as soon as he got the chance
 baad main kuch bhi pasand na hone kii baat kehete hue nikal lete
 But luck struck when targeting Deepak Tailors' shop in the city's l block
 maalik deepak kaa maathaa thanka, jab usne dekha ki khaali thile ke saath aae yuvak kaa thilaa jate vakt bharaa hua tha
 He immediately noted the number of both the bikes and then went inside his shop and saw many expensive suits were missing
