nadi ek kism ke bade talab main tabdeel ho jaati he
 You will also see such scenes if you ever go through this rail route
 mujhe lagata he isi pani ne to kahin is line ko khokhla na kar diya ho, kyonki pani nai jameen par nae raste khojataa he, uski apni gati he, apana rasta he
 Information is also coming that the dam water was released, or filled
 pushti honi baaki he, lekin mujhe sitambar 1999 kii narmada kii baadh jarur yaad aati he
 In this flood too, Narmada was stuck on one bank of river for four days
 yah baadh jitani barish se nahin ai thi, usase adhik is kaaran se ai thi ki jabalpur ke bargi baandh, barna baandh or hoshangabad ke tawa baandh se ek saath pani chhod diya gaya
 It was devastated by floods in the submergence area for five to six days
 tippaniyan Now that the entire Narmada river has been converted into small reservoirs by constructing large dams everywhere, the effect of changes in geographical structures can also be seen
 isame railway ke monitering system kii laaparvaahee to saaf he, lekin is bindu se bhi jaanch kii jarurat he ki yah kya keval rail vibhaag kaa haadasa he

 i have been traveling on this railway line since childhood, on my way to my maternal uncle's house in Harsud
 harsood visthapit hone ke baad bhi gaya hum, nayi rail line se
 During the rainy season, large structures of waterlogging have also been seen here
 jis kalimachak nadi ke aasapaas kaa kinaaraa palon main najar ke saamne se guzar jaataa tha, baandh banane ke baad lambii duuri tak yah samaj paanaa mushkil hota he ki nadi kahaan he
 The river turns into a kind of large pond
 aap bhi yadi kabhi is rail root se jaaenge to aapako aise drishy dikhaai denge
 i think that this water has not made this line hollow, because water finds new paths on new land, it has its own speed, its own path
 suchanaaen yah bhi aa rahi hai ki baandh kaa pani choda gaya, yaa bhar gaya
 Confirmation remains, but i do remember the Narmada floods of September 1999
 is baadh main bhi chaar dinon tak narmada nadi ke ek kinare par fansaa rahaa tha
 The floods did not come as much from the rains, because of the simultaneous release of water from the Bargi Dam in Jabalpur, Barna Dam and Tawa Dam in Hoshangabad
 ise dub kshetra main paanch se chah din tak baadh ne tabaahi machaai thi
 The comments ab jabaki puri narmada nadi par jagah-jagah bade-bade baandh banaakar use chote-chote jalaashyon main tabdeel kar diya gaya he, tab bhugolic sanrachanaon main badlaav kaa asar yun bhi najar aa saktaa he
 In this, the negligence of the monitoring system of the railway is clear, but from this point also it needs to be investigated whether this is only the accident of the railway department

 The new Prime Minister should immediately give a good speech on energy
 isamen urja sankat kii gambhirtha ko bataate hue sarkaar kii is manshaa ko spasht karnaa chahie ki vah desh ke hydrocarbon sansadhano ke dohan tathaa akshay urja ke istemaal ko or tej karnaa chaahati he
 It also seeks to develop a multilateral strategy to increase energy conservation and efficiency, weaken the nexus between economic growth, energy demand and environmental protection
 pradhanmantri ko is baat par jor dena chahie ki urja ko samekit or samgr drushti se dekha jayega or sarkaar urja javabdehi or suraksha ko lekar sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main ek bill lekar aegi
 Through this bill, a blueprint for achieving energy self-sufficiency, security and sustainability will be prepared
 is raste par hui tarakkee ko puri tarah se maapne ke liye bhi spasht paimaana tay kiya jayega
 Prepare an energy policy Within 100 days of his speech, the Prime Minister should announce the formation of an energy department under the PMO
 piem ko yah bataanaa chahie ki urja sansaadhan or suraksha kaa yah vibhaag ek samekit urja niti taiyaar karegaa, yah niti antarrashtriya urja suraksha ko paribhaashit karne or yah sunishchit karne kaa centre bindu hogi ki ‘india energy ink’ ke rasookh or sansaadhan bhartiya urja companiyon kii videshi parisampattiyon kii kharid kii koshishon main sahyog karne main lagaae jaaen
 This department will decide the areas of research, develop technology partnerships and fertilize new ideas
 urja mahakama is sector kaa ‘urja lokapal’ hoga, puri niamak jimmedaari ke saath or yah sarkaar kii urja niti ke tark or auchity ke bare main janata se samvaad or sampark kaa mukhya bindu hoga
 The Prime Minister has to make it clear that the purpose of this department is not to supplement the ministries currently handling energy matters - petroleum, coal, electricity, renewable and non-conventional energy and nuclear power - but to look at the issues that these ministries have Left out of the realm
 is 100 din kii avadhi main pradhanmantri ko petroleum or koyala sachivon ke saath oengisi, oil india or kol india ke chairman se mulaakaat kar utpaadan badhaane par charchaa kerani chahie
 The Prime Minister should direct ONGC and Oil India to raise the recovery rate from their oil and gas fields from the current average of 28 per cent to at least 40 per cent of the global average
 agle pradhanmantri ko kol india ke chairman se kahana chahie ki utpaadan main giravat ko dur karen or koyala aayaat kii badi pravriti ko roke
 In return, the government will have to promise these PSU officers that they will be protected from excessive surveillance and interference from bureaucracy
 unhen laal fitaashahee or manjuuri ke abhaav main latake koyala project kaa rasta bhi saaf karnaa hoga
 Build consent is the subject of a concurrent list
 iske vikaas main centre or rajya sarkaron, donon kii raay chalati he
 The next Prime Minister will have to form a political consensus on the controversial issues of energy
 pradhanmantri ko mukhyamantriyon tak yah sandesh pahunchaana chahie ki ve rajya bijli bordon, bijli utpaadan, keemat, sabsidi, vastu or seva kar (jiesti), bhoomi adhigrahan, regulation or manjuuri se jude masalon kaa samaadhaan chaahate hai
 There should be comprehensive agreement on economic issues
 bijli bordon ko munafa aadhaarit shulk vasuulne kii ijaajat deni hogi, urja keemton ko bazaar ke anuroop rakhana hoga, sabsidi par ankush lagaana hoga—agar sabsidi di jaati he to ise saarvajanik khajaane se diya jaae or labhaarthiyon ko sidhe transfar kiya jaae—jiesti ko lagu karnaa hoga or manjuuri prakriya ko zyada sakasham bananaa hoga
 But one should not bow down to political pressure
 usee sabakaa nateeja he ki desh main urja sankat lagaataar bhayaavah hota ja rahaa he
 The next prime minister should present a solution that is economically sensible and politically acceptable, with a goal of one year
 urja aatmanirbharta ke liye nijee kshetra kaa nivesh aprihaary he
 Whether it is to increase supply by increasing investment in fossil fuels, limiting demand through various energy saving modes or environmental protection through clean technology, the role of the private sector is inevitable
 haalanki, contract, keemton, marketing ke bare main sarkaar kii nitiyon main ulat-pher or afasarshahi kii dakhsandaji vaali nigaraanee kii vajah se nijee kshetra pareshaan hi rahata he
 The Prime Minister will have to make every effort to change this perception within a year
 nitigat morche par dekhen to iskaa matlab petroleum mantralay ko yah sunishchit karne ke liye kahana he ki nai anveshan licesing niti (enielpi) kii sharten pratispardhi or lacheelee hon, inke tahat open acrees biding kii ijaajat di jaae, utpaadan-saajhedaari samjhaute main ‘cost oil’ recovery siddhant ko banaae rakhaa jaae tathaa isko hataakar ‘venue shering’ model lagu na kiya jaae or gas utpaadan main bhi usee tarah ke tex ke phaayde die jaaen jaise tel utpaadan main milte hai
 This would mean that c
 rangarajan samiti ke sujhaaye gaye aath dollar prati mmbitiu gas keemat ko hi aage badhaayaa jaae or gas udyog ko infrastracchar kaa darja diya jaae
 The Prime Minister will have to pressurize the Ministry of Coal to reduce the monopoly of Coal India through partial privatization of coal mining
 desh main 24 ghante bijli aapurti ke liye bijli mantralay ke prayaason main bhi pradhanmantri ko sahyog dena hoga
 The Ministry of Power aims at separating the production, transmission and distribution systems, improving power generation through the choice of the right fuel, technology, fixing different prices and curbing losses in distribution and transmission
 Can achieve
 bharosemand banaaenakhir main, pradhanmantri ko har kisi ko is kaam main lagaana hoga ki vah bainkon ke saath milakar desh main urja ke buniyadi dhaanche—gas pipeline, koyala dhulaai, bandargah suvidha—ke vikaas ke liye banking suvidha kaa phayda uthaa sakane vaale model kaa vikaas karen
 The Prime Minister should personally meet the heads of major energy companies in India and abroad and assure them that the Government is committed to providing a competitive, transparent, fair and market-based fiscal and working conditions
 bharat ko ab gaiyr-jeevashm eendhan vyavastha kii taraf baduya hi hoga
 Now its economics is improving
 maikinje kaa anumaan he ki ek solar power unit lagane kii laagat 2010 ke chah dollar prati wat se ghatakar aaj mahaj 2
 60 dollars per watt and by 2020 it will be further reduced to 1
 60 dollar tak pahunch sakati he
 However, the 'smartness' of the grid has not been improved accordingly
 clin energy ke morche par agua rahane kii kshamta bharat main he
 To achieve this position, the sector will require political cooperation, executive clarity and organizational flexibility
 saura, pawan or nabhikeey urja ke vikalpon ke punaruddhar or unase jude ‘smart grid’ kaa vikaas piem ke samooche kaarykaal ke dauraan lagaataar praathamikta rahani chahie

 The reason is that in the special CBI court, Lalu Prasad's side is putting his side in the fodder scam
 iske saath hi unke jail jane ke kayaason kii ulti ginati bhi shuru ho gai he
 Prior to this, all the tactics were adopted by Lalu Prasad to prolong the trial of the fodder scam

 However, Lalu Prasad could satisfy neither the High Court nor the Supreme Court with his arguments

 The court sentenced three officers of the Animal Husbandry Department to seven years imprisonment with a fine of 2-2 crores
 aropiyon main purv rural diarector ke en jha, junal bhengraj or assistant diarector ke em prasad shaamil the
 At the same time, 10 accused were sentenced in the case of illegal withdrawal of 37 lakhs from Godda treasury, RC-33 / 96, in which former RJD MP RK Rana and former BJP MLA Dhruv Bhagat were sentenced to five years each
 vahiin agar court kii najar main lalu prasad doshi sabit hote he or unhen sajaa milti he to unke political kariyar par grahan lag saktaa he

 sahitya ajtak ke duusare din sidhi baat stage par ‘sahitya main muslim samaaj’ vishay par charchaa kii gai 
 Is our literature divided into social religion, fraternity? Does literature also have a society of its own? The three big writers present for discussion on this were Abdul Bismillah, Bhagwandas Morwal and Anjum Usmani
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan shamstahir khan ne kiya
 Shams questioned whether hindu-muslim also occurs in literature
 is par abdul bismillah ne kaha ki ye kehane main koi hichak nahin honi chahie ki hindi upanyaas main premchand ke baad kisi bhi lekhak kii kahani main muslim damadari se nahin dikhataa
 On whether Muslim writers still fear to write openly, Bhagwan Das replied that after independence, there is not a single novel by any Hindu writer in which Muslim society comes to its full extent
 kahaniyon main muslim paatr jarur aate hai lekin wo chhaunk kii tarah aate hai
 Divya Dutta had made a mother, the daughter used to call her by name, Anjum Usmani said that society is not made up of religion
 maine jo sahitya padhaa usamen mujhe hindu-muslim nahin dikhaa
 There was no Muslim society in this
 bebaaki se likhane ke sawaal par abdul bismillah ne kaha ki main bilkul nahin darataa
 i have got the good fortune that i have seen Hindu society as well as my society
 main naukari ke silsile main 10 saal banaras main rahaa
 For the whole 10 years it remained among the weavers
 main donon ke bich rahaa or donon ke bare main khulkar likhaa he
 How much does literature mean to bring Muslim society into the mainstream? On this question, Abdul Bismillah said that Muslim society is in the mainstream
 ham number do ke naagarik nahin hai
 We are all Indians
 vahiin bhagwaan das ne kaha ki muslim samaaj ko lekar jo dharna he use badalani hogi
 Anjum Usmani said who is going to decide this mainstream
 main khud mukhyadhara hum
 This is all outside of literature
 sahitya main hindu-muslim nahin balki aap kya hai, ye zyada myne rakhata he
 The religion of literature is to stand on the side of the victim: Narendra Kohli: It is clear that in the writings of Abdul Bismillah, the struggle, sorrow and life of Muslim society is visible

 notebandi se sirf aam log or kisaan hi pareshaan nahin hue, balki isane miyaan-bibi ke bich paise ko lekar takaraar bhi paidaa kar di he
 Its hallmark is seen in Madhya Pradesh, where the number of cases filed during this period has increased in the counseling centers set up to resolve the quarrels
 gauravi adhyaksh sarika sinha ne bataaya, 'notebandi ke baad madhya pradesh main gharelu hinsa ke aankde bahut bade hai
 'gauravi - One Stop Crisis Center', which is jointly run by the Public Health and Family Welfare Department and actionaid of the Government of Madhya Pradesh
 jamaa karaane die paise patniyon ko lautaae nahinsarika ne kaha ki 8 november conotbandi kii ghoshnaake baad kai aise maamle 'gauravi' main aae, jinamein mahilaon ne apane chupaaye hue 500 or 1000 rupee ke amaanya noton ko bainkon se badalane ke liye apane patiyon ko diya, lekin baad main unke patiyon ne ye paise unhen waapas nahin kiye
 Due to this, there was a tussle between mian-biwi and their relationship got upset
 sarika ne kaha kuch aise bhi maamle aae, jinamein patniyon dwaara chhupaae gaye 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note 30 disambar ke baad bhi mili
 There was also a quarrel between them and husband and wife got into a fight, due to which cases of domestic violence were registered
 paraamarsh kendron main donon pakshon ko samajha-bujhaakar in jhagadon ko khatm karaayaa ja rahaa he
 First 50, then between 200 cases every month, Shivani Saini, the director of Gauravi, said, 'from November to January, about 200 cases of domestic violence have been registered every month at their' Gauravi center 'in Bhopal, whereas earlier about 50 cases were registered
 The cases used to come every month
 ' unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke khilaaf gharelu hinsa ke jo 200 maamle aae, unamem se adhiktar miyaan-bivi ke bich notebandi se hui paise kii kami ko lekar hue jhagade or marpet kii shikaayatein thi
 Shivani said, 'domestic violence used to happen earlier, but after demonetisation, cases of domestic violence have increased a lot
 'shivani ne kaha, 'hamaare paraamarsh centre main kai aise maamle aae jinamein mahilaon ne shikaayat kii ki notebandi ke baad paise kii tangi ke chalate unke pati ne ghar main rasoi gas nahin bharwai, bacchon ke liye khaane-pine kii chijen nahin laae, rojaanaa upyog main laai jane vaali aavashyak vasteen jaise doodh, saag-sabji evam fal nahin laae, kyonki ve bank se bhi apana paisa nahin nikaal paa rahe the
 This problem also led to mutual quarrels in many families
 ' unhone kaha kinotbandike baad ham har maheene 200-250 aise gharelu hinsa ke maamalon par sunwaayee kar paraamarsh de rahe hai
 Low and middle class women are more victimized
 Shivani said that among the women who have come to the counseling center for domestic violence, the daily wage laborers, lower class and middle class women, because after the demonetisation, they hid money from their husbands
 Saved, he was mostly looking for 500 and 1000 rupee notes that could be exchanged from banks
 lekin in mahilaon main se kai ke paas rashan card, aadhaar card evam bank main khate nahin the, jiske kaaran ve in paison ko swayan nahin badalawa sakin
 These women gave these money to their husbands to exchange them from the banks, but many people did not give this money back to their wife after changing the old notes from the bank
 iske ulat ve apni patniyon ye taane dene lage ki ve unki kamai ko unki jebon se chori kar chipa leti hai, jisase unke bich jhagade hone lage
 Shivani said that such problems have not come from very good families
 ab jhagadon main thodi kamishivani ne kaha ki ab paise ke maamle ke gharelu hinsa ke maamle kam hone lage hai
 He said, 'after the ban of demonetisation, there were major problems for about 3 months, now there is some relief
 notebandi ke baad kai mahilaon ne shikaayat kii ki unke pati ne unhen paise kii dikkat or paisa bachaa-bachaa kar chhupaakar rakhane ke liye na keval maaraa-peeta, balki ghar se baahar bhi nikaal diya
 According to the data from the Madhya Pradesh Women's Commission, 59 cases of domestic violence on women were reported to them in October, while these cases increased to 68 in November and 86 in December
 is prakaar gharelu hinsa ke maamalon main mahila ayog ke aankadon ke anusaar oktober ke mukaable november main 15 pratishat ijapha or disambar main 45 pratishat vruddhi darj kii gai
 However, a member of the Women's Commission said that cases of domestic violence increase in a month and decrease in a month
 akhil bhartiya mahila parishad kii varisht paramarshdaata reeta tuli ne bataaya, 'bhopal sthit mahila thana jahangirabad main unki nigaraanee main chal rahe mahila paraamarsh centre main gharelu hinsa ke 10 se 15 maamle roj sune jate hai or inamen se kuch notebandi ke chalate bhi aaye hai
 Rita also said that many women complained during the consultation that the money they had kept hidden from their husbands had to be given to them to exchange their husbands after demonetisation, as many women did not have accounts in the bank
 
 "usne mujhe kamare main band kar diya he or baahar baithkar nazaren banaae hue he
 i have now gone and got my phone back
 mujhe abhi madad chahie
 Can you call the police please
 
 
 agar mumkin ho to tum aa jaao
 "" i can't come yet
 lekin kya main esha ko bulaauun? wo sabase paas hogi
 Tell me fast "ye saare massej dilli ke panchasheel park ke apane makaan kii teesri manzil se kud kar jaan denevaliare hosteonisia ne us rose dopaher do bajkar 56 minute se 3 bajkar 11 minute tak apni saheli raakhi ko whatsap par bheje the
 But exactly one hour after that, at exactly 4:15 in the evening, the message Anisia sent to her friend was very intimidating
 usne likhaa "main apane-aap ko khatm karne ja rahi hum
 Mayank has given me this position
 usne akhirkaar mujhe kamare se to baahar nikaal diya, lekin jo nuksaan usne kiya he
 It cannot be replenished
 "or isse pehle ki dur baithi raakhi apni saheli anisia ko aisa karne se roak paati, anisia ne thik 18 minute baad yani shaam chaar bajkar tees minute par teesri manzil se chalaang laga di
 Everyone knows what happened next
 anisia ko foran uske pati mayank ne aas-paas ke logon kii madad se uthaa kar aspataal pahunchaaya, jahaan doctoron ne use murda qaraar de diya
 Now in this case, the police have arrested Anisia's husband Mayank and sent them to jail, and it is also clear that Anisia has jumped and killed herself
 lekin is air hostess kii maut ko lekar sawaal ab bhi kaayam he
 The biggest question is, what harm did Mayank give Anisia, which could not be repaid? Why did Mayank lock Anisia in the room that day? Why was her mobile phone snatched from her? And what was the reason for the fight between the two? Obviously, the Hauz Khas police of Delhi investigating the case have to find the answers to these questions
 vaise is chat se lagata to yahi he ki us rose anisia mayank kii zyadatiyon se kuch itnaa pareshaan ho chuki thi ki usne khudakushi kar lee, lekin anisia ko jaananevaalon kii maane to wo khudakushi karanevaali ladki nahin thi, balki wo bahut hi buland iradonvaali or majboot ladki thi
 But this is the truth of the conversation with her friend before Anisia's death
 ab anisia ke gharavaalon kii taraf se police ko pichley maheene di gai ek shikaayat bhi saamne ai he, jisamen unhone bataaya tha ki unka damaad mayank anisia ko behad pareshaan kar rahaa he or uski jaan bhi le saktaa he
 Anisia's father, Major General Ropinder Singh Batra, wrote a letter to the Delhi Police on June 27 that Mayank could take Anisia's life and call it an accident or a suicide
 zaahir he, ab jab anisia kii maut ho chuki he, to sawaal police bhi he
 And it is also the responsibility of the police to investigate the matter by quoting what is written in this letter
 notebandi ko lekar siyasat bhi khub tej ho rahi he

 Because of fake inter-topper Ganesh Kumar, now those who reduce their age by giving a second exam are not well off
 bihar vidhyalay pariksha samiti ek aisa ap banavaa rahi he jisase dubling hone par ap khud ba khud un parikshaarthiyon kaa naam short list kar legaa, jinhone apni umr karaane ke liye 10veen kii pariksha dobaaraa di he
 The board had to take this decision due to Ganesh, who retook the 10th exam to reduce his age and topped the inter
 ganesh ne 1990 main bihar board se pehali baar metric kii pariksha paas kii thi
 He again passed the matriculation exam in 2015 to reduce his age, so that he could get a government job
 apni umr kam karaane ke liye ganesh jaise hajaaron log hai jo metric yani 10veen kii pariksha dobaaraa dete hai
 Such examples are also found around, but the board has decided to take a lesson from Ganesh's result, which can also threaten the job of thousands of people
 board agle teen maheenon ke andar pichley 30 saalon ke record ko is ap main aplod karegaa
 Usually students who take the exam again change their name
 jaise ganesh ne 1990 main ganesh ram ke naam se pariksha di thi or 2015 main ganesh kumaar ke naam se, lekin record main pita kaa naam or pataa ek hi hota he
 In such a situation, it will not be difficult for the app to catch this
 ek hi pita ke naam or pataa se do-do baar pariksha jisane bhi di hogi wo saamne dikhne lagenge
 This app will short-list such people and then they will also be identified
 board 1986 se lekar ab tak ke record ko is ap main aplod karegaa
 That is, anyone who has given the matriculation examination again in these 30 years can be detected
 board ke adhyaksh anand kishor kaa kahana he ki jiskaa bhi pataa chalegaa ki unhone dobaaraa metric kii pariksha di he to unke certificate ko radd kar diya jaayegaa
 If the certificate of the 10th or matriculation examination is canceled, then all the further degrees of that person will automatically become invalid
 board ne pehle hi metric or inter ke 2005 se 2016 tak ke chaatro kii marks seat ko online kar diya he
 Now the board prepares to make data from 96 to 2004 online as well
 board kaa maananaa he ki isaki vajah se bhi umr yaa naam badalakar dobaaraa pariksha dene vaale chaatro par lagaam lag sakegi

 Like every newly-married couple, Arunachalam Muruganantham also wanted to see his wife happy
 bivi ko rijhaane ke liye wo jo kuch ban padataa tha, sab karte the
 But one day everything changed
 unhen shaayad khud bhi pataa nahin rahaa hoga ki bivi ke liye unki chintaa hi un donon ke bich jhagade kii vajah ban jaaegi
 One day during menstruation, his wife was going to use an old cloth like a pad
 muruganantham ko ye acha nahin laga or unhone bivi kii is pareshaani ko apane upar le liya
 They decided to make an alternative to that old sanitary pad
 periods ke bare main or senetary pads ke bare main unhen bhi utani hi jaankaree thi jitani kisi ek saamaanya purush ko hoti he
 But they had already decided
 unhone ye tay kar liya tha ki wo ek aisa senetary pad banaaenge jo bazaar main bikne vaale duusare branded senetary pad se sasta ho or sabase jaruri, surakshit ho
 But it is not as difficult to think something through
 apni is koshish main wo kai baar asafal hue
 Some success was also achieved
 
 
 apane sapane ko sach karne main unhen kareeb saadhe chaar kaa samay laga
 During this, the worst happened was that his wife, whom he loved the most, left him
 is product ke silsile main muruganantham tarah-tarah ke sawaal karte the, logon se iskaa samaadhaan poochhate the joki kaaphi asahaj tha
 His wife did not find this normal and she left him
 muruganantham ke jivan kii ummid, jiske liye unhone ye sapana tay kiya tha wo unase dur ja chukaa tha
 His wife thought that in his separation, Muruganantham might leave this work and be as before
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 Muruganantham kept on trying to achieve his goal
 unhone ek purush kii tarah nahin balki ek mahila kii tarah is prakriya ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 He continued to wear sanitary pads and seek solutions
 ye jaanane kaa prayaas kiya ki mahilaon ko usadauraan kin pareshaaniyon se guzaranapadataa he or unki jarurat kya he
 He conducted several surveys to make this discovery accurate
 saikadon mahilaon se is bare main baat kii
 Finally one day came when he really did what he had thought
 aaj wo na keval world class senetary pad bana rahe hai balki ye pad, bazaar main bikne vaale senetary pad se kahin zyada saste bhi hai
 Many people have also got employment by joining this work
 jab unki patni ko unki is kahani ke bare pataa chalaa to unhen ehsaas hua ki wo kitni galat thim
 Five years later, she contacted her husband and now she is pursuing this work with him

 com / hb5ula4tsi— Anand Narasimhan (@anchoranandn) July 10, 2019 According to the regulation of fielding in Powerplay-3, during the third power play, a maximum of five players can remain outside the 30-yard circle
 lekin dhoni ko ball phenke jane pehle soshal media par viral graphics main dikh rahaa he ki newjiland ke 6 khilaadi sarkal ke baahar khadey the
 It is to be remembered here that the ball on which Dhoni was run out, even if he was no ball, he would have been out
 (niyam ke anusaar, jitne khilaadi 30 gaj ke ghere main hone chahie, usase kam yaa zyada hone par no ball qaraar di jaati he
 With no ball, the batsman cannot be dismissed in any way other than run out
 yani ampire ne no ball di hoti, to bhi dhoni ran out hote)@icc@cricketworldcuphow This kind of activities hapens?are the umpires are blind or you guys?how Can 6 players can be in long(outside the circle) at Power play 3?

 kabhi diji vanjaaraa gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke khaas hua karte the, lekin ab aisa kya hua ki unhone modi se baghawat kaa elaan kar diya he
 According to family sources, the arrest of Asaram, who was accused of sexual abuse, shook Vanzara and lost his trust in Modi
 vanjaaraa ne police seva se istipha dene ke liye jail se jo 10 pannon kii chitthee likhi, usamen kaha ki modi unke liye bhagwaan the, lekin unhone unhen jail main chhod diya

 'bataaya jaataa he ki vanjaaraa khud ko bhagwaan maanane vaale aasaraam ke param bhakt hai

 a member of Vanzara's family told Mumbai Mirror, 'saheb (vanjara) had been patient for the last seven years

 And Asaram Bapu had become Saheb's strength for the last seven years, but he was also arrested
 sahib ko vishwaas tha ki unke bhagwaan (modi) unke guru ko bachaa lenge
 But now they are completely broken
 'khabar ke mutabik jail main asaram ne apane guru asaram kii prashansa main lagbhag do darjan kavitaayen bhi likhin
 Vanjara often used to talk to Asaram on the phone from Sabarmati jail, but this conversation also stopped after being shifted to Taloja jail
 gauratlab he ki soharabuddin encounter, ishrat jahaan encounter or tulsi prajapati encounter main diji vanjaaraa aaropee hai
 Vanzara alleges that Modi did not help him during difficult times and blames Modi's close friend Amit Shah for this
 apni 10 pannon kii chitthee main vanjaaraa likhte hai, 'main ye bataanaa chahta hum ki maine itane lambey vakt tak sirf isliye chuppi saadhe rakhi kyonki main narendra modi ko bhagwaan maanata tha
 But he did not help me like God under the bad influence of Amit Shah
 amit shah ne modi kii aankh or kaan par kabja kar liya he
 For the past 12 years, Amit Shah has been offering Modi a goat as a dog and a dog as a goat

 The 2012 Nobel Prize winning Chinese writer Mo Yan's novel 'change' is now coming to Hindi
 is kitaab kaa naam hoga 'ham, tum or wo trek
 The Hindi translation of this offering of "yatra Books" has been done by Professor Pushpesh Pant
 kitaab kii relies se pehle ham iskaa exclusive hissaa khaas aapke liye laae hai
 One of the participants from 'hum Tum Aur Truck' was a math teacher Liu Tyung-gwang — a short-faced man with astonishingly wide mouth
 hamane suna tha ki vah apni bandhi mutthi apane munh main samaa sakate hai haalanki hamamen se kisi ne unhen aisa karte dekha nahin tha
 a visible image of him, which often flashed into my brain, was about to yawn with a standing, open mouth on the stage
 unka ek naam ‘hippo’ tha
 Now none of us had seen this creature, which in Chinese is called 'hema' which sounds somewhat 'hama' - a species of frog whose mouth is very large
 atah ye swaabhaavik hi tha ki ham logon ne unhen mendhak liu kahana shuru kar diya
 This was not my invention, but after inquiring, Liu Massahab had decided that it was my own doing
 skool kii krantikari samiti ke upaadhyaksh ek shahid ke bete kaa mendhak liu ke rup main namakaran aisa jaghanya aparaadh tha, jiske liye mujhe skool se nikaala janaa or skool ke ahaate se baahar khadedna tarksangat or avashyambhavi tha
 The purpose of all this chatter is to set the stage for the dramatic scene ahead: Opening his mouth, the master tosses the ball with the top spin, which Vennelly returns straight away, as if the shiny ball looked the way through his eyes, straight open mouth
 Entered into ham bhi stambhit rah gaye
 Then the fountain of laughter opened
 maa naam ke adhyaaapak kaa cheharaa, jo pehle se hi laal tha
 Now it became ruddy like a chicken
 vinley jisane munh lataka rakhaa tha, jor se chahak uthi
 i was the only one who did not laugh
 vismit yah dekhtaa rahaa ki ho kya gaya he? mujhe gaanv ke dada wang gui se suni ek kahani yaad aa gai
 When once a hapless Ishan named Jiang Jia was selling flour
 hawa kaa tej jhonka ise uske haath se nikharaa gaya
 Then he tried to sell coal
 par is baar jaada padaa hi nahin
 When he looked up at the sky, the bird beat in his mouth
 bees saal baad 1999 ke patjhad main jab main metro se akhbaar ke daftar ja rahaa tha akhbaar bechney vaale ne meraa dhyaan aakarshith kiya: ‘padhie! padhie! mahayuddh kaa bada ajooba—soviet top se daaga gola sidhaa german top kii naal main ghus gaya!’ mujhe achaanak vah din yaad aa gaya, jab vinley kii pingpong kii gend liu massaab ke munh main ghus gai thi
 After this, everyone felt that they should not laugh
 ekaek sab chup ho gaye
 You might be thinking that Liu would have spit the ball out and taken some witty jokes — he was of humorous nature — Wenley apologized feeling embarrassed
 magar aapkaa aisa sochna galat hoga
 Instead of spitting the ball, Liu drew his neck, stretched his eyes even more and tried to swallow the ball — we all saw it
 phir usne apane haath chatpataae or gale se ghargharaahat vaali awaz nikaali
 He looked like a chick who had swallowed a poisonous insect
 ham log bhuchakke asahaay khadey the
 Except teacher Zhang
 jo daudkar liu ke paas pahunche or unki peeth par thapki maarane lage
 Then another teacher named Yu ran to Liu and put his hands under his neck
 dakshinpanthi adhyaaapak wang medical colej ke snaatak the or jaanate the ki kya karnaa chahie
 He came running and pushed Zhang and Yu away
 apni banar jaisi lambii bhujaaon ko liu kii qamar ke gird lapeta or haathon se sharir ke madhyabhaag main jhatka diya
 The ball fell from the mouth of Liu to the flying table, where he ate two or four taps and fell on the ground and rolled an inch without sticking
 wang ne liu ko chhod diya, jo ghutati cheekh ke saath aise bhurabhura kar pasar gaya jaise mitti kaa bana ho
 Lu Wenli threw his bat on the table, hid his face in the palms and escaped crying
 wang ne zamin par pade massaab kii tab tak maalish kii, jab tak vah sahaara lekar uth khadey nahin ho gaye
 As soon as he could stand, he looked around and said with a full hug: 'where is Lu Wenli? That devil had killed me! salmaan khan ko bollywood ke dabang khan ke rup main janaa jaataa he

 ) On the issue of demonetisation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who arrived in Patna's Girdnibagh on Wednesday, targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar without taking anonymity
 mamata ne kaha ki 'notebandi ke mudde par jo bhi centre sarkaar kaa saath degaa vah gaddaar he or janata use kabhi maaf nahin karegi'
 Significantly, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has openly supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government on the issue of demonetisation, which Mamata Banerjee is unhappy about
 isse pehle mamata banerjee ne rashtriya janata dal supremeo lalu prasad yadav or unke parivaar waalon se mulaakaat kii or apane dharna pradarshan main unase samarthan maanga
 Lalu also supported two senior leaders of his party, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Ramchandra Purave, to support Mamta, to make Mamata's protest demonstration a success
 patna main hi the nitishapane 24 ghante ke patna pravaas ke dauraan bihar ke mukhyamantrinithish kumarase mulaakaat nahin kii
 Nitish Kumar and Mamta Banerjee are believed to have a cordial relationship, but the manner in which the Bihar Chief Minister has supported the central government on the issue of demonetisation has led to a tussle between the two
 mamata ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi ko bhi yah baat sabit kerani chahie ki uske paas kaala dhan he yaa nahin
 Mamta said that the manner in which the BJP bought many lands in Bihar right before demonetisation, it proves that BJP leaders were already aware of demonetisation
 gauratlab he ki centre sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle ke khilaaf mamata banerjee ne jang ched rakhi he or isi ko lekar kolkata, dilli or lakhanu ke baad unhone patna main bhi dharna pradarshan diya

 There is also increasing competition in the mandals to install huge Ganapati idols and attract more and more crowds
 zyaadaatar ye murtiyon plaster of paris se bani hoti hai
 At the end of the festival all Ganapati idols are immersed in the Arabian Sea
 haalanki mumbai main aise log or kuch mandal hai jo paryaavaran ke bare main jaagruk hai or ve iko friendli ganpati murtiyon sthapit kar rahe hai
 India Today reached a workshop where idols are being made from paper
 lalbaag main ek prasiddh mandal he jo kaagaj or mitti se ganpati kii 22 feet oonchi vishaal murti bana rahaa he
 There are more than two thousand registered Ganapati mandals in Mumbai
 lekin jab gharon or anya sthanon kii baat karen jahaan ganpati kii sthapana kii jaati he to ye sankhya bahut badi ho jaati he
 But there is little awareness about the environmentally friendly immersion sites set by BMC
 haalanki ganpati kii adhiktar murtiyon vishaal hai or unhen paryaavaran ke anukool chote talabon main nahin visarjeet kiya ja saktaa
 Hence most of the Ganapati idols are immersed in the Arabian Sea
 plaster of paris se bani or paint hui murtiyon rasayanon kii vajah se samudr main nahin ghulti hai
 The Arabian Sea is the major source of seafood for Maharashtra
 agar pichley saal kii hi baat karen to, ganpati visarjan ke saatven din hi mumbai ke samudr taton par kai machhliyaan, pani ke saanp or kachhue mrit dekhe gaye
 According to marine experts, the death of these organisms is due to the arrival of such chemicals in the body, which stops breathing
 itnaa hi nahin, ganpati murtiyon ke jo hisse nahin ghulte wo waapas samudr tat par aa jate hai
 This scene hurts people's feelings
 mattunga main murti nirmaataa sagar chitale kaagaj se ganpati kii murtiyon banaate hai
 Sagar Chitle said, "it is a long process
 navaratri kaa tyohaar khatm hone ke baad, maine murtiyon bananaa shuru kar diya
 The price of eco-friendly sculptures made of paper is higher than that of the Plaster of Paris, but if one wants to save the environment then it is worth nothing
 acha yah he ki log jaagruk ho rahe hai or kaagaj ke ganpati kii baari maang he
 The huge Ganpati idols can also be made of paper and they do not harm the environment
 murtiyon ke aabhushan vaala hissaa bhi kagaz kaa bana hua he
 We also do not use nails and instead use glue and small wood
 sarkaar ko bhi is pahal main madad kerani chahie or aisi murtiyon ko banane ke liye jagah uplabdh karaani chahie
 India Today then reached Tejukaya Ganapathi Mandal in Lalbagh
 yah vishaal ganpati murti ke liye prasiddh he
 This year also, this mandal is installing the huge Ganapati idol, but this time it will be made of paper and clay
 22 feet oonchi ye ganpati murti iko friendli he
 Not only this, these circles are not using thermocol or even plastic
 sajaavat bhi kagaz or rooyee se kii ja rahi he
 In fact, the Mandal is appealing to the devotees not to bring incense sticks and flowers for the idol but to bring pencils, pens, notebooks and other such useful items which can be donated to the flood affected areas of Kolhapur and Sangli
 ye mandal, jo ab apane 53wein varsh main he, paryaavaran ko samay kii jarurat maanata he

 Samantha Bradshaw, lead author and researcher at Oxford's Computational Propaganda Research Project, believes that social media make propaganda campaigns stronger and possible than before
 mujhe nahin lagata ki log ye jaanate honge ki kitni sarkarein un tak pahunchane ke liye in sadhano kaa upyog karti hai
 It is hidden to a great extent
 sarkaron ke saport vaale online grups kii aadaten alag-alag hoti hai jo fasebuk main coment karne or twitor par post karne se lekar vyaktigat rup se ek-ek insaan ko target karne jaisi hoti hai
 These groups of governments have even exploited journalists in Mexico and Russia
 sarkarein original content kahaan se ban rahaa he ise saamne naa aane dene ke liephek acounts kaa bhi saharaleti hai
 Fake accounts in Serbia are used to promote the agenda of governments
 vahiin vietnam main blagars apni tarah kii khabaren failaane kaa kaam karte hai
 Similarly, governments in Argentina, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela and elsewhere use automation software (bots) to make misleading posts on social media
 jo maanav yujar kii tarah hin prathit hoti hai
 Propaganda is a dark art used by governments that, according to Bradshaw, makes digital tools even more advanced
 sarkarein pichley kuch saalon main activiston se sikh lekar kaam karne lagi hai
 The way activists use social media to spread information, so have governments
 is report se ye ashanka jataai ja sakati he ki bharat bhi rajanithik partiyon dwaara soshal media par logon ko gumraah karne ke is pantare se achhuti nahin hogi

 But his difficulty is that one-third of the children are missed in this campaign because they do not understand the benefits of vaccination, then one-third of the natural problems after vaccination - fever, crying and traveling
 Also prevents parents, while 8-10 per cent reduction in the remaining one-third is due to ANM not reaching difficult areas

 The Aadhar card has become an enemy for Sablu Goswami, a farmer from Talbehat in Lalitpur district
 olavrishti ke baad jo sarkari muabaje kii check unako di gai vah unke liye kaagaj kaa tukdaa ban gai
 Because, to redeem the check, they had to have an account with the bank and to have an Aadhar card to open the account
 natijatan vah apane acount main muaavja raashi nahin le sake
 There is also a Sablu stamp winder and now there is a plan to make Aadhaar mandatory for renewing its license
 yadi aisa hua to vah berozegaar ho jaaenge
 This is not the first case
 shahar se lekar gaanv tak log aadhaar card ko hasil karne ko lekar pareshaan hai
 Sablu Goswami says, i am in the category of disabled
 aakhon kii retina mashin scan nahin kar paa rahi he
 Therefore, the base could not be formed
 aadhaar nahin ban paane ke kaaran unka bank main khaataa nahin he
 Recently, to redeem the check of hailstorm, i had applied to open an account with Allahabad Bank, but the manager refused to open the account due to lack of Aadhaar
 abhi tak aadhaar nahin ban sakaa he
 a similar case is of Ramkinkar Upadhyay of Talbehat
 ritred shikshak ramkinkar kii pension band kar di gai
 He was asked to bring Aadhaar
 aa85 saal kii umr main unki haathon kii ungliyaan ghis chuki thim
 The biometric machine did not scan his fingers
 jab aadhaar nahin ban paaya to pension roak di gai
 The problem is not so full
 kai logon ko to rashan dena sirf isliye band kar diya gaya he, kyonki vah be-aadhaar hai
 Facilities in rural areas without Aadhaar have been stopped
 lalitpur jile ke natthikheda gaanv ke rambharose putr jagan ko gaanv ke kotodaar ne rashan dena band kar diya he
 Rambhrosse says, the kotedar has said that bring the Aadhaar card only then you will get ration
 aadhaar card banavaane shahar teen baar ja chukaa hum
 Aadhar card is not available there
 ab rashan ke bina ghar kaa kharch chalaanaa manhagaa ho gaya he
 Many times the problem has not been solved after keeping the problem in Tehsil Day
 vahiin, mahilaayein is baat se pareshaan hai rashancard main mukhiya mahilaon ko banaaya gaya he
 Now women have to go to the ration shop to get ration
 centaron kii kamidansal, sarkaar ne aadhaar card banane ke liye jo centre khole the unako bhi band kar diya gaya he
 Now Aadhaar cards are being made only at select locations in the district
 jhaansi control room par roj aadhaar card se sambadhit shikayaton kaa ambara laga he
 The second problem is the closure of the center
 jile main pehle 92 centaron par aadhaar banaae ja rahe the, lekin ab sirf 15 centaron par hi aadhaar ban rahe hai
 At the same time, Aadhaar is being made in some banks, but there are not more than 20 applications taken in a day
 is samasya ke liye jhaansi main tainaat senior kaaryakari adhikari sumit singh kehete hai, roj aadhaar card ko lekar samasyaayein aa raheen hai
 Many people have their pension stopped because their finger prints are not coming in the machine
 finger print samasya un logon ke liye or bhi vikat he jin logon ke aadhaar card ko bane teen saal ho gaye hai
 Now if your Aadhaar card is lost after three years has passed, then simply stating its number to get it rebuilt will not work
 biomatric mashine apadet nahin hoti hai isliye aapaki ungali or retina ko vah capchar nahin karegi
 Says executive officer Sumit
 mashiinon ke apadet nahin hone ke kaaran yah samasya aa rahi he
 The solution of such people is not at the district or divisional headquarters
 unako lakhanu sthit riginal offis hi janaa hoga
 The new Aadhaar will be updated by updating their old records there
 aise kai cese saamne aa rahe hai, lekin graminon kaa lakhanu jaakar kaam karana chunauti he
 Village head of Pawa, Jyoti Mishra says, even after the Supreme Court does not consider Aadhaar card mandatory, people are being denied facilities without it
 logon ke bank acount nahin khole ja rahe
 Due to this, they are also being deprived of schemes

 Many of us must have done boating in the lake outside the old fort of Delhi and have seen scenes of Hero Heroin boating in this lake in many films, but now this lake has been dry for the last 8 months and the responsibility to fill it Regarding each other's responsibility in governmental affairs

 Outside the old fort was to protect it from enemies
 yahaan yamuna se pani aata tha
 Then the Yamuna flowed very close to the eastern gate of the old fort
 lekin baad main pump lagaakar or barish ke pani se jhil ko bharaa jaataa tha
 Principal Secretary of the National Heritage Trust, Manu Bhatnagar, says that "here the water used to come from the Yamuna but in the decades the stream of Yamuna has gone away due to which the water has to be filled in an artificial way, it is difficult to keep the lakes filled even with ground water

 Water used to come from Yamuna here
 tab yamuna puraane kile ke purvi dwaar ke bilkul nazadik bahati thi
 But later the lake was filled with pumps and rain water
 rashtriya viraasat trust ke pramukh sachiv manu bhatnagar kaa kahana he ki "yahaan yamuna se pani aata tha lekin dashakon main yamuna kii dhara dur chali gai he jis vajah se pani ko kritrim tareeqe se bharna padataa he, ground water se bhi jhiilon ko bharaa rakhana mushkil he
 The best way is to fill the lake with recycled water
 " The ASI is maintained by the old fort and the Boat Club was maintained by the Delhi Tourism Department, but now the contract is over, so the responsibility rests with the ASI
 par ASI bhi is puure maamle main baat karne se manaa kar chukaa he or saath main kendriya paryaton vibhaag bhi jhil par chuppi saadhe hue he
 But people are still waiting that some department will take the responsibility and bring back the glory of the old fort lake

 a few hours before he was hanged, Afzal Guru wrote his last letter to his wife
 faansee dene kii puri karrwai ko kuta naam ‘aaparishan thri star’ diya gaya tha
 This letter written in Urdu was sent only on Saturday, but the letter has not yet reached his wife in Kashmir
 tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ne somvaar ko bataaya ki 2001 mensansad par hue hamalaa maamle main doshithahraaye gaye afjal guru ko 8 farvari kii shaam ko bataaya gaya tha ki agle din subah ‘aaparishan thri star’ kuta naam ke tahat usefaansee de dijaegi
 The preparations to hang Afzal started on 4 February with the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 apana naam jaahir nahin hone dene kii shart par adhikari ne kaha, ‘jab use faansee kii jaankaree di gai tab vah shant or pratikriya viheen tha
 He expressed his wish to write a letter to his wife
 jail adheekshak ne use kalam or kaagaj diya
 "the officer said," He wrote a letter in Urdu which was sent to the address of the family living in Kashmir the same day
 ’jab ghati ke sopor main rah rahe uske parivaar se khat ke bare main poochtacha kii to unhone kaha ki abhi tak unhen yah khat nahin mila he
 Afzal Guru's cousin Yasin Guru said, 'we have not received the letter yet
 jo khat hamen mila he vah shaayad uski faansee die jane kii jaankaree se sambandhit he
 The executioner was summoned to hang Afzal Guru near his secluded cell in Tihar Jail No-3
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ‘is faisle kii jaankaree kuch gine chune adhikariyon ko hi di gai thi
 Three physicians and a cleric, who buried her shroud, were secretly informed the night before
 unhen shanivaar savere hi aane ke liye kah diya gaya tha
 'the purpose of keeping the action confidential was not to let people know about it
 afjal ne subah kii apni namaaj adaa kii orpavitra quran ke kuch pannon kaa paath kiya
 He was calm on the morning of the gallows and greeted the officers
 inamen se kai logon ko usne unke pehle naam se sambodhit kiya
 After hanging, Afzal was buried near his cell
 parivaar ne maang kii he ki unhen afjal guru kaa antim sanskaar karne kii ijaajat milani chahie
 Officials have said that 'the government will take a decision in this regard

 apane rochak twit or alag andaaj main cricket ke judi baat rakhane vaale team india ke purv openar virendra sahvaag ko srilanka ke khilaaf team india ke match se pehle apane anumaan ko lekar 'baikfoot' par aana padaa
 Viru's speculation about Team India's match against Sri Lanka in the Champions Trophy proved to be completely wrong
 sahvaag ne ek channel se baat karte hue kaha tha ki srilankai team ek bhigi maachis kii tarah he, jisamen koi chingaari hi nahin he
 Sehwag's statement was proved completely wrong by the Sri Lankan team led by Angelo Mathews
 champions trophy ke antargat kal hue mukaable main srilanka ne sitara khilaadiyon se saji team india ko saat wicket se maat di
 With this victory, the Sri Lankan team kept their chances of entering the semi-finals of the tournament alive
 tippaniyan Talking before the match, Sehwag said that our team is in full form
 vah har tarah se srilankai team se saamana karne ko taiyaar he
 He said that the Sri Lankan team is like a wet match in which there is no spark
 baharhaal yah anumaan jataakar sahvaag desh ke hajaaron cricketpremiyon kii hi tarah galat sabit hue
 Sri Lanka performed well in the match, forcing Team India to defeat
 is match main pehle ballebaaji karte hue team india ne 50 overs main 6 wicket khokar 321 ran banaae the
 Batting in response, the Sri Lankan batsmen hit strokes and 48 against the Indian bowlers
 4 over main lakshya hasil karke match apane naam kar liya
 In this match, the Indian team scored 321 runs in 50 overs with the help of Shikhar Dhawan's century (125 runs) and the half-centuries of Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni
 jawaab main srilanka team ne dhanushka gunatilka ke 76, kusal mendis ke 89, captain maithyuj ke 52 tathaa kusal perera ke 47 ranon kii madad se bharat kii ore se rakhe gaye lakshya ko teen wicket khokar hasil kar liya
 Kusal Mendis, who scored 89 runs, was declared Man of the Match
 sahvaag kii is baat ko angelo maithyuj ke netritv vaali srilanka team ne puri tarah galat sabit kiya
 Sri Lanka beat the star-studded Team India by seven wickets in the Champions Trophy match held yesterday
 is jeet ke saath hi srilanka team ne toornament ke semifinal main pravesh kii apni sambhaavnaaon ko jeevant rakhaa he
 The comments sahvaag ne match se pehle baatcheet karte hue kaha tha ki hamaari team puure form main he
 He is ready to face the Sri Lankan team in every way
 unhone kaha tha ki srilankai team to ek bhigi maachis kii tarah he, jisamen koi chingaari hi nahin he
 However, this estimate proved that Sehwag was wrong like thousands of cricket lovers in the country
 srilanka ne match main behtareen pradarshan karte hue team india ko haar ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Batting first in this match, Team India scored 321 runs losing 6 wickets in 50 overs
 jawaab main batting karte hue srilankai ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon ke khilaaf jamkar stroke lagaae or 48
 Achieved the target in 4 overs and won the match
 is match main bhartiya team ne shikhar dhawan ke shatak (125 ran) or rohit sharma va emes dhoni ke ardhashtakon kii madad se 50 over main 321 ran banaae the
 In reply, the Sri Lankan team achieved the target of India by losing three wickets with the help of Dhanushka Gunatilaka's 76, Kusal Mendis '89, Kaptan Mathews' 52 and Kusal Perera's 47 runs
 89 ran kii pari khilne vaale kusal mendis ko main of da match ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Talking before the match, Sehwag said that our team is in full form
 vah har tarah se srilankai team se saamana karne ko taiyaar he
 He said that the Sri Lankan team is like a wet match in which there is no spark

 Who will win this time? If only he wins, how much will he win? 
 
 kahin wo to nahin jeet jayega
 The survey is also saying
 maaloom nahin chal rahaa he
 Is the survey saying something wrong? The previous survey was correct, but the previous survey was wrong
 chunaav aata he, to is tarah kii baaten charchaa-e-chakallas kii duniya kii khuraaq ban jaati hai
 Opinion polls have always been controversial, controversial
 jaise sting oparation kii vaidhata or naitikta kaa sawaal deergh-uttareey prashn kii tarah lataka rahata he, vaise hi opinian pole pratibandhit karne kaa sawaal laghu-uttareey vastunishth prashn nahin ho saktaa he
 On Tuesday, a news channel called News Express did a sting to show how the company of surveying some people by moving some leads to a decrease in seats
 sting karne vaale news express ke anusaar aisi 11 companiyaan hai, jo nateezo main herpher karti hui pai gayi
 Survey companies typically run a margin of three percent for being short-sighted, but according to Sting, Sea Voters officials were willing to increase it from three to five percent
 ham is sting kii satyata kaa pareekshan karne yogya nahin hai, isliye news express kii tarah daawa nahin kar sakate
 Nor do we have the favor of all the companies involved in the sting
 in sab baton kaa dhyaan rakhana isliye jaruri he, taaki santulan kii aupchaarikta kii aadat bani rahe
 By the way, Yashwant Deshmukh of Sea Voter said that he has also done surveys for News Express Channel
 unhen apni team par garv he
 Think of a margin of three to five percent, if such a percentage swings in someone's favor, then his wind, then thunderstorm and then wave will appear in the survey
 jahaan 10 hazaar se lekar paanch hazaar ke antar se haar-jeet hoti ho, vahaan yah margin khatarnaak he
 That too by paying money
 is baat kaa koi mukammal adhyayan nahin he ki aap survey se prabhavit hokar hi vot dete hai
 Most things are a clash
 agar survey galat hue hai, to iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki aap survey se bahut zyada prabhavit nahin hote hai
 Today, the Aam Aadmi Party questioned the validity of the opinion poll and said that political conspiracy is going on in the country
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli chunaavon main kis tarah se bijepi ko pehle 20, phir 30 or chunaav aate-aate 40 siten di jane lageen
 The same thing is happening during the Lok Sabha elections
 har hafte bijepi kii pehle 160 aaengi, phir 190 aaengi or sab logon ko pataa he ki chunaav aate-aate ise 280 tak le jaaya jayega
 And on 280 it will be shown that Modi ji's government is being formed inside the country
 ek sawaal yah khadaa hota he ki ek hafte ke andar puure desh main itane survey kaise ho jate hai
 Yogendra Yadav did not speak of the ban, but advocated transparency
 congress netaa ajay maakan or legal cell ke adhyaksh kasee mittal ne bhi aaj chunaav ayog se mulaakaat kar kaha ki opinian pole par bain laganaa chahie
 Kejriwal is now asking Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party that how much money should be distributed to which channel and how much money should be distributed to which poll agency, it should be investigated by making an SIT
 congress ke ajay maakan kah rahe hai ki opinayan pole main kalaadhan lag rahaa he
 By the way, on 23 February, Harinder Baweja reported in the Hindustan Times that Rahul Gandhi is conducting a survey to find out the popularity of his candidates
 syrius rahiye ye prime time he
 Today, the statement of the Chief Election Commissioner has come that the Commission had suggested this in an all-party meeting in 2004, 10 years ago
 faisla to sarkaar ko hi karnaa he
 In January, the Times of India reported that the government was considering banning opinion polls
 sochati rah gai
 Keep in mind that in 2009, Parliament enacted a law banning exit polls before all the voting phases are completed
 ayog kaa tark he ki dakshin bharat sahit puure bharat main raajnneetik dalon or netaaon ke apane channel hai
 Can their opinion poll be neutral? Can anyone not mislead by showing survey on the basis of money and influence? Last year, the Election Commission had written to all parties about these same questions in Aktabur, but nothing happened
 sarkaar ko jaise sting kaa intjaar tha, taaki har survey main badhat ko praapt narendra modi or bijepi par nishaanaa banaaya ja sake
 bjp's opinion about opinion polls is not to be banned
 survey bijepi ke khilaaf bhi galat hue hai
 Atal ji lost the election even after the lead in all the surveys in 2004
 4 november, 2013 ke times of india main narendra modi kaa bayaan chapa he ki survey bain karnaa moulik adhikaron kaa hanan he
 He said that i am aware of their limitations
 2002 main opinian pole ne dikhaaya tha ki bijepi kii sarkaar gujarat main nahin banegi
 Opinion poll has been a mix record
 yah raajnneetik dalon par nirbhar karata he ki ham pole kaa kya karen
 But the purpose of banning is not understood
 kya agsit pole kii tarah survey ko bain kar dena chahie? duniya bhar main survey hote hai or vivaadaaspad bhi rahe hai
 Have surveys also become paid news items? desh main aitihaasik sainya sudhaar ke tahat pradhanmantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko elaan kiya ki sena ke teenon angon ke pramukh ke taur par ‘chif of dephence stoff' (sidies) kaa padasrujit kiya jayega
 The proposal, which came during the Kargil war in 1999, was still pending
 pradhanmantri modi ne 73wein swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par laal kile kii pracheer se apane bhaashan main yah mahatvapurn ghoshnaa kii
 He said that CDS will ensure coordination between the Army, Navy and Air Force and give them effective leadership
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘bharat main ab chif of dephence stoff hoga
 This will make our armed forces more effective
 ' sena ke teen angon ke pramukhon main sabase varisht vyakti sidies hoga
 Its basic role will be to work towards enhancing the working coordination between the Army, Navy, and Air Force and to look at national security with a holistic approach
 sidies pradhanmantri tathaa raksha mantri ke liye mahatvapurn raksha evam samrik muddon par sainya salaahkaar kii bhoomika bhi nibhaayega
 After the Kargil War in 1999, the High Level Committee constituted to find the deficiencies in the security system of the country had advocated the appointment of the Chief of Defense Staff
 rashtriya suraksha vyavastha main jaruri sudhaaron kaa vishleshan kar rahe ek mantri samooh ne bhi chif of dephence stoff kii niyukti kii pairvi kii thi
 In 2012, the Naresh Chandra Task Force recommended the creation of the post of permanent head of the Chiefs of Staff Committee
 maujuuda samay main chinas of stoff cameti main sena, nausena or vayusena ke pramukh hote hai tathaa inamen sabase varisht vyakti iskaa pramukh hota he
 After the Prime Minister's announcement, former Army Chief VP Malik tweeted, "thank you Prime Minister Modi for taking the historic step of making the institution of CDS
" is kadam se rashtriya suraksha or prabhavi evam kifayati hogi
 'VIDEO: PM Modi's big announcement about the army from the ramparts of the Red Fort maharashtra ke grahamantri aaraar patil ne chagan bhujabal ke khilaaf jaanch ko hari jhandi dikhaa di he
 The demand for investigation was constantly being made about the disturbances in the construction of Maharashtra Sadan and according to the news that is coming now, investigation will be done against Chhagan Bhujbal
 tippaniyan Sources are saying that two days ago, the Home Minister has given permission to the state's Andy Corruption Bureau to conduct an inquiry in this regard
 bataa den ki chagan bhujabal ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii jaanch ke liye asibi ne grahamantri se ijaajat maangi thi

 baat unki bahanon kii ho to arjuna apni naaraazgi khuleam jaahir karne se nahin chookte hai
 Recently, an online portal reported the trolling of Jahnavi Kapoor's dress
 news kii hedline dekhakar arjuna kaa gussa soshal media par jamkar niklaa
 He wrote two trolls wrote about the photo and you made it big news
 ye behad sharmnaak he ki kaise media trorls ko badhaava de rahi he
 2 trolls write a comment n for the web team of a big newspaper it's a news story
 
 
 slow clap 👏 ridiculous how trolls are given attention by the media & they wait for us to retaliate
 
 
 the lesser the stories the lesser the trolls win
 
 
 — Arjun Kapoor (@arjunk26)june 5, 2018bahan jahnavi kii dress par bhadde coment se bhadke arjunabtaa den haal hi main ishan khatter ke saath jahnavi mumbai ke ek cafe main spot huin thi
 Jahnavi was wearing a short one piece dress
 jiske baad ek online portal ne ye kehete hue khabar bana di ki jahnavi shaayad kuch pahananaa bhul gayi
 This is not the first time that Arjun Kapoor's anger has been seen when he has spoken against his family
 pehle bhi jahnavi kii dress par trol kiye jane par unhone karaara jawaab diya tha
 He tweeted- It is shameful that your eyes see it all
 isi tarah hamaara desh ek yang women ko dekhtaa he
 it's so embarrassing
 arjuna kapur in dinon namaste england shooting kar rahe hai
 Parineeti Chopra will be seen with her in this film
 vahiin jahnavi kii film dhadak kaa shoot puraa hone ke kareeb he, haal hi main unka photoshute viral hua tha
 The film is a 'bhootnath Returns' sequel and its story begins from where the first film 'bhootnath' ended
 
 
 moksh paane ke baad bhootnath jab apni duniya main pahunchate hai to unka mazaaq udaaya jaataa he ki vah kisi ko daraane main kaamyaab nahin hue
 
 
 That's why Bhoothnath comes back to the world to scare children, and descends to Dharavi, Mumbai's largest slum area
 
 
 vaise, is baar bhi vah daraane main bhale hi naakaam rahe, lekin unhone ek bachche ke saath milakar buraai ke khilaaf jang ladi, or ladaa chunaav
 
 
 Bhoothnath is such a ghost in itself that the audience does not fear, loves and the success of the first film is a testimony to this
 
 
 yah ek kamedi film he, jo mazaaq-mazaaq main bahut kuch kah detii he
 
 
 'bhootnath Returns' shows how leaders contest elections unfairly, how corruption is consuming the country, and how government machinery does not work without bribes
 
 
 yahaan tak ki 'bhootnath riterns' main bahut chaalaaki se yah bhi bataa diya gaya he ki system ke kharaab ravaiye ke hi kaaran bhoot bhi chunaav lard saktaa he
 
 
 The dialogues of 'bhootnath Returns' are good, which sometimes make us laugh, sometimes weaken the country's system
 
 
 amitabh bachchan or boman irani kii bhoomikaayen to acchhee hai hi, 'akhrot' naamak bachche kaa kirdaar bhi khub nibhaayaa he parth bhalerao ne
 
 
 Director Nitesh Tiwari has beautifully put the story on screen
 
 
 film kaa first half khaastaur se acha or kamedi se bharaa he, lekin second half main film kuch syrius ho gai, isiilie film thodi lambii bhi lagane lagati he
 
 
 Although the film did not lose its grip, the story of the second part, like the first part, would have been told in a slightly more light-hearted manner, perhaps the film would have been more entertaining
 
 
 kul milakar 'bhootnath riterns' na sirf manoranjak he, balki chunaav ke is maahaul main darshakon ko sandesh bhi detii he ki ve vot zarur den, kyonki vot hi aapaki awaz he
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 3
 5 star
 
 
 JDU leader KC Tyagi has demanded a ban on Amit Shah's arrival in Bihar on World Yoga Day
 unhone chunaav ayog ko chitthee likhakar patna main yoga diwas kaarykram main shah ko shirkat karne se rokane kii maang kii he
 Actually assembly elections are going to be held in Bihar
 isi ke maddenjar tyaagi nechunaav ayogko likhaa he ki bijepi netaa yoga diwas ke jariye chunaav prachaar karne aa rahe hai
 He has written in his letter that celebrating World Yoga Day by the Ministry of AYUSH is a welcome step, but the program will begin with the Prime Minister's speech
 unhone ise matadaataaon ko lubhaane kaa kutsit prayaas bataaya he
 Citing the code of conduct in a letter written to the Election Commission, he has requested that BJP President Amit Shah be prevented from coming to Patna
 tyaagi ne kaha kiyog divasake kaarykram ke jariye bijepi matadaataaon ko fansna chaahati he
 He has demanded a ban on all the ministers of the BJPK from participating in the events on Yoga Day
 ek taraf to modi sarkaar vishwa yoga diwas ke kaarykram ko bhavy banane main koi kor kasar chhodana nahin chaahati, to duusari taraf use vipaksh kaa virodh bhi jhelana padaa he
 Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh also said on Saturday that the Prime Minister is glorifying himself through Yoga Day

 chunaav main teen mukhya partiyon- aam aadmi party (AAP), bhartiya janata party (BJP) or congress ke bich muqabla he or teenon ne votaron ko lubhaane ke liye puure damakham se prachaar kiya he
 According to the instructions of the Election Commission, all the parties ended the campaign at 6 pm
 yani ab na hi kisi party kii raily hogi or na hi radio yaa televijan ke madhyam se prachaar hoga
 However, candidates will be able to go door to door seeking votes
 aakhri din sabane foonki jaanprachaar khatm hote hi partiyon kii ore se bheje jane vaale vot apil vaale mobile esemes par bhi roak lag gai
 Here, on the last day of campaigning, AAP and BJP Chief Ministerial candidates addressed their public meetings
 AAP sanyojak kejariwal ne nai dilli vidhansabha kshetra main paidal march kiya, jabaki kiran bedi ne apni seat krishna nagar main chunaav prachaar kiya
 Congress campaign committee chief Ajay Maken and party vice president Rahul Gandhi held a road show in the capital
 kejariwal nai dilli, kiran bedi krishna nagar or maakan sadar bazaar seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Most recent opinion polls are giving the Aam Aadmi Party an edge
 india today group or sisero ke opinian pole ke mutabik, bahumat ke liye AAP kii raah aasaan najar aa rahi he
 According to the poll, it can win 38 to 46 seats, while the BJP can win 19 to 25 seats
 pichhali baar bani thi trishanku vidhansabhayaad rahe ki saal 2013 ke chunaav main trishanku vidhansabha bani thi, jisamen bijepi ko sabase zyada 31 siten mili thim or AAP 28 siton ke saath duusare number par thi
 The Congress was reduced from 43 seats to 8 seats
 trishanku vidhansabha ke bich AAP ne janata kii raay lene ke baad congress ke bahari samarthan se sarkaar banaai thi, lekin vidhansabha main jan lokapal vidheyak ko congress or bijepi ne samarthan nahin diya
 After this, Chief Minister Kejriwal resigned on 14 February 2014
 kejariwal ke istife ke baad 17 farvari se yahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya tha
 After repeated demands of the AAP and rebuke of the Supreme Court, a re-election was announced in Delhi
 (input: IANS) Narendra Modi, who is going to start his second term as Prime Minister, said on Saturday that his government will now embark on a new journey to build a new India with new energy
 modi ne endie ke navnirvaachit saansadon se bina bhedbhaav ke kaam karne ko bhi kaha
 In his nearly 75-minute speech after being elected the leader of the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance, Modi said the need to win the trust of the minorities also said that those who believe in vote-bank politics forced the minorities to live in fear, We have to end this trick and take everyone along
 jaane piem modi ke bhaashan kii 10 badi baaten
 
 
 1
 piem modi ne bijepi ke navnirvaachit saansadon ko tamaam muddon par sikh di
 To the newly elected members, he said that our fascination puts us in trouble
 isliye hamaare nae or purana saathi in chizon se bachein kyonki ab desh maaf nahin karegaa
 We have huge responsibilities
 hamen inhen nibhaana he
 We must change ourselves by speech, by behavior, by behavior, by thought
 viipi culture se desh ko badi nafrat he
 We are also citizens, so why can't we stand in queue
 main chahta hum ki hamen janata ko dhyaan main rakhkar khud ko badalanaa chahie
 Removal of red light did not bring any economic benefit, good message has been sent among the public
 unhone kaha ki saansadon ko jarurat padane par anya nagarikon kii tarah kataron main bhi khadaa hona chahie
 2
 modi ne mantri banaae jane ko lekar hone vaale kanafusi par kaha, 'is desh main bahut aise narendra modi paidaa ho gaye hai, jinhone mantrimandal bana diya he
 All who have won have belonged to me
 sarkaar or koi banane vaala nahin he, jisaki jimmevary he vahi banane vaale hai
 Neither ministers are made from the pages of the newspaper, nor do ministers go
 ' unhone kaha ki mantri padon ke liye media kii khabaron main chal rahe naamon par bharosa nahin karen, niyamon ke anusaar jimmedaari di jaaegi
 3
 media se dur rahane kii salaah dete hue ki piem modi ne kaha ki chhapaas or dikhaas se bachanaa chahie
 If you run away from it, you can save a lot
 hamaara moh hamen sankat main daalata he
 So our new and old colleagues avoid these things because now the country will not forgive
 hamaari bahut badi jimmedaariyaan he
 We have to fulfill them
 vaani se, bartaav se, aachaar se, vichaar se hamen apane aapako badalanaa hoga
 4
 modi ne kaha, 'janata ne hamen itnaa bada aadesh diya he
 It is natural that the chest becomes wide, the forehead becomes high
 janpratinidhi ke liye ye daayitv hota he, uske liye koi bhed rekha nahin ho sakati he
 We are also for those who were with us and for those who are going to be with us in future
 hamaara naaraa (NARA) rashtriya aakanksha or kshetreey mahatvakanksha he
 5
 piem ne kaha, endie ke paas do jaruri chijen hai, pehla energy or doosraa sinerjee
 This energy and synergy is such a chemical, on which we have become strong and capable, on which we have to move forward
 unhone kaha ki bharat main to chunaav apane-aap main ek utsav tha
 The turnout was also full of colors, but the Vijayotsava was even more spectacular
 6
 The Prime Minister said that the tremendous mandate greatly increases the responsibilities
 jimmedaariyon ko ham saharsha sweekaar karne ke liye nikle hue log hai
 For that we have to move forward with new energy, new enthusiasm
 bharat kaa loktantr, bharat kaa matadaata, bharat kaa naagarik uskaa jo nir-ksheer vivek he, shaayad kisi maapdand se use mapa nahin ja saktaa he
 7
 modi ne kaha ki prachand janadesh jimmedaariyon ko bhi bahut badha detaa he
 We are willing to accept the responsibilities gladly
 uske liye nai urja, nai umang ke saath hamen aage badhanaa he
 The democracy of India, the voter of India, the citizen of India, his lowly conscience, probably cannot be measured by any criteria
 unhone kaha ki satta kaa rutaba bharat ke matadaata ko kabhi prabhavit nahin karata he
 The voter of India neither accepts nor digests power
 is desh kii visheshta he ki bade se bade satta samarthy ke saamne bhi sevabhaav ko wo sir jhukaakar ke sweekaar karata he
 Whether we have come as representatives of BJP or NDA, people have accepted us because of their service
 8
 He said that the election of 2019 became a movement of social unity, equality as well, Mamta also, samabhav as well as mamabhav
 is vaataavaran ne is chunaav ko ek nai oonchai di
 This country worships hard work, this country puts faith on its head
 hindustan ke matadaata main jo nir-ksheer vivek he, uski takat dekhie
 If there is a culmination of hard work and if there is not even a little doubt on honesty, then the country will go with it
 9
 PM Modi said that public representatives can never distinguish
 nae janpratinidhiyon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki janpritinidhi ke saath hamaara koi bhi paraayaa nahin ho saktaa he
 Its strength is very large
 dilon ko jeetne kii koshish karenge
 There were many stages of my life, so i understand these things very well, i have seen so many elections, lost and won, but i can say that the election of 2019 in my life was a pilgrimage of sorts
 10
 The poor in the country were the subject of a political debate, became a part of fashion, remained in confusion
 paanch saal ke kaarykaal main ham kah sakate hai ki hamane garibon ke saath jo chal chal rahaa tha, us chal main hamane chhed kiya he or sidhe garib ke paas pahunche hai
 The tag of this poverty has been imposed on the country, the country has to be freed
 garibon ke haq ke liye hamen jeena-jujhna he, apana jivan khapaana he
 The same deception has happened to the poor, the same has happened to the country's minority
 durbhaagya se desh kii minurity ko us chalaave main aisa bhramit or bhaybheet rakh gaya he
 It would have been better if Minority's education, health were concerned
 2019 main aapse apeksha karne aayaa hum ki hamen is chal ko bhi chedna he
 We have to win trust

 The Foreign Ministry has denied the claim of US President Donald Trump, in which he has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ever sought his help on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir

 India's position on Kashmir remains the same and the third party will not be allowed to interfere

 Priyanka Gandhi said that if the BJP leaders who talked big about patriotism were true patriots, then they would respect the martyrs of the country, whether they are martyred Hindus or Muslims or father of their political opponents
 vah shahid hai
 You cannot choose which martyr to honor
 agar aap sachche deshbhakt hai to rajeev gandhi or indira gandhi samet sabhi shaheedon kaa sammaan karen
 She was speaking at a street corner in Fatehpur, UP

 Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi says that even after India's reluctance, it will continue to restore peace efforts in the region
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha he ki paak ke saath baatcheet kii bharat kii anichhaa ke baavjood islamabad kshetra main shanti ko badhaava dene ke apane prayaas nahin rokegaa
 Qureshi's statement comes days after New Delhi canceled the foreign minister-level meeting in New York
 washington main pakistani duutavas main ravivaar ko samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kuraishi ne kaha ki bharat sitambar main jis shanti vaarta ke liye sahamat hua tha use radd karne ke liye july main hui ghatnaon kaa istemaal kiya
 India on Friday canceled a meeting between Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Qureshi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on the basis of issuing postage stamps of 'barbaric' killings of 3 policemen in Jammu and Kashmir and 'glorifying' Kashmiri terrorist Burhan Waniqa
 Was given 'hamaare daravaaje khule rahenge'kuraishi ne kaha, 'bharat anicchhuk he, lekin ham apane daravaaje band nahin karenge
 Pakistan's English newspaper 'dawn' quoted him as saying, "ignoring the issues does not end them
 isse kashmir kii sthiti main sudhaar nahin hoga
 The Foreign Minister further said that he did not understand India's refusal to participate in peace talks with Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'baatcheet, baatcheet nahin
 Coming, not coming
 hamaari baatcheet kii ichha thi kyonki hamaara maananaa he ki samajhadaari bharaa rasta milanaa or baatcheet karnaa he
 They agreed and then disagreed
 ' kuraishi ne kaha kipakistan ke shanti prastaavpar bharat kii pratikriya kathor or gaiyr rajanyik thi
 He said, 'we did not use non-diplomatic language in our response
 hamaara jawaab paripakv or napa-tula tha
 He took a new stand and turned around
 'videsh mantri ne aarope lagaaya ki swaraj kii 'bhashaa or sur videsh mantri jaise pad ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 "asked whether tensions between India and Pakistan can lead to war between the two countries," Qureshi said, "who is talking about war? We are not
 ham shanti, sthirataa, rojgaar or behatar jivan chaahate hai
 You know who is reluctant
 ''yah kamajori kaa sanket nahin'kuraishi kaa kahana he kipakistanki shanti kii ichha ko bhulvash kamajori kaa sanket nahin maananaa chahie
 He said, 'we want peace, it does not mean that we cannot defend ourselves against aggression
 ham kar sakate hai lekin hamaari aakraamak maansikta nahin he
 Qureshi dismissed India's concern over the issuance of postage stamps' glorifying 'the slain Kashmiri terrorist and said,' Thousands of people are fighting in Kashmir, not all of them terrorists

 'when he was asked that the people of UP gave a majority to the Samajwadi Party with great expectations, but at the moment nothing significant changes are visible in the state

 khabaren aisi aa rahi hai ki priyanka apane american boyfriend nik jonas se shaadi kaa plan bana rahi hai jiske chalate unhone film bharat se bachout kar liya he
 But now a new news has made the matter more confusing
 jaankaree ke mutabik priyanka ne farhaan akhtar starer film The Sky Is Pink sin kar lee he or vah isaki shooting 8 agast se shuru karne ja rahi hai
 priyanka-nick's wedding date final, to be married in October? Deccan Chronicle in a report based on some sources related to Farhan's film, "priyanka shooting for our film (the Sky Is Pink) in Mumbai from August 8 Will start yadi vah shaadi kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar rahi hotin to vah hamen bataatin
 It is expected that she will start shooting for Salman's film Bharat from the second week of August
 kyonki plan to ye tha ki donon filmon kii shooting saath main chalegi
 But now she will only be shooting for our film

 Gujarat Election 2017: Will Congress be able to end 22-year 'political exile'? Let us know that Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for the last 22 years
 1995 main bijepi ne pehali baar gujarat main sarkaar banaai thi
 This was followed by the RJP government between 1966–1998, amid fluctuations in political developments
 congress is sarkaar kaa hissaa thi
 However, after 1995, the Congress could never get power on its own
 magar, is baar halaat thode juda hai
 Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are in the politics of the Center
 saath hi bijepi ke samarthak rahe patidaar aarakshan ke naam par virodh kaa bigul phoonk chuke hai
 In such a situation, the Congress would like to make every effort to save its land in the upcoming elections
 # metoomamale main fanseemje akbarne aakhirkaar buudhvaar ko videsh rajyamantri pad seistifade diya
 After this, a series of statements started in the political corridors
 kendriya mantri harsirmat cor ne istife par kaha ki agar 20 mahilaon ne aarope lagaae hai to koi baat to rahi hogi
 Priyanka Chaturvedi of Congress said that all women who raised this issue, including Priya Ramani, for bringing the matter to the fore
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne kaha he ki aakhirkaar akbar ne pad se istipha de diya
 He should be ashamed to resign late
 is istife kaa shrey centre sarkaar yaa khud akbar ko die jane ke bajaay # metookempena ko diya janaa chahie
 Especially the brave women who complained about this and the women and men who stood by those victims
 Finally MJ Akbar has resigned
 Shame on him for having delayed it for so long
 The credit for the resignation goes not to the Centre or MJ Akbar but directly to the # metoocampaign
 Esp to those brave women who reported the assault & those women and men who stood by them
 — Swati Maliwal (@swatijaihind)october 17, 201820 mahilaon ne lagaaya aarope, koi to baat hogiakabar dwaara apane pad se deree se die gaye istife par kendriya mantri or akali dal netaa harsimrat cor badal kaa kahana he ki insaan ko apni aatma kii aawaaj suni chahie
 And when 20 women are saying such a thing, there is some truth in things
 shikayatakarta keval ek mahila nahin he or kisi raajnneetik party se judi hui nahin he
 So i think that what has happened and the action taken has been corrected
 mahila virdohi bijepi kii maansikta ke congress ke aarope par harsimrat cor badal ne kaha ki congress se zyada kisi or kii maansikta nahin giri he, jo akele baton main karte hai hakeekat main vah kya karte rahe hai
 At the same time, Union Social Justice Minister Ramdas Athavale has said that the opposition demanded the resignation of Akbar on moral grounds
 emje akbar kaa istipha dene kaa faisla sahi he
 The allegations against him should be investigated
 sutron ke mutabik sangh emje akbar se is maamle main naaraaz tha
 Also, the Sangh had given this information to the government
 mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye ladane vaali ranjana kumari ne kaha ki mahilaon ne apni takat dikhaai
 Don't forget that this is the result of the strength of solidarity of women journalists and the national support for the # metoo campaign that Akbar had to resign
 desh kii mahilaayein yaad rakhen ki aap majboot he
 Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi said that all the women, including Priya Ramani, who have come forward in this matter and raised objections, all of them are very respectful from my side
 ye istipha sach kii shakti kaa saboot he
 # metooindia On the other hand, Chairperson of National Commission for Women Rekha Sharma said that i welcome the decision of the government on MJ Akbar
 mahila ayog bhi is faisle kaa swaagat karata he
 We are happy that the government decided in this matter
 
 Let me tell you that 20 women journalists have so far accused MJ Akbar of # metoo wrapped under the # metoo campaign
 akbar par pehla aarope varisht patrkaar priya ramani ne lagaaya tha, jisamen unhone ek hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan kii apni kahani bayaan kii thi
