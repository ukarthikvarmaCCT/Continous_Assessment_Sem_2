 lalu ne inako laabh pahunchane ke evaj main keemtee jameen or makaan daan ke jariye hasil kiya

 bhai ke samadhiyaane, apni sasuraal, beti ke sasuraal ke rishtedaaron ke naam se apane kaledhan se jameen va makaan kharide or baad main patni beton va betiyon ke naam gift karvaa liye

 India Today Conclave East 2019 Inaugurated on ENRC, Citizenship Bill was discussed by well-known personalities, the popular and popular event of India Today Conclave Today Group 'india Today Conclave East 2019' has started
 'citigen koun- enarasi banaam naagarikta sanshodhan adhinium' seshan main bijepi netaa chandra bose, AIUDF netaa aminul islam, jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ke angreji ke professor monojit mandal, supreme court ke vakil upamanyu hajarika or supreme court ke centre for research and planning ke purv pramukh krishna mahajan ne apni raay rakhi
 The stage was moderated by Rahul Kanwal, News Director, TV Today Network
 jadavapur vishvavidhyalay main angreji ke professor monojit mandal ne charchaa main apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki seshan kaa jo vishay he usamen pripojishan kii jagah conjction 'and' lagaana chahie kyonki donon ke bich koi takaraav nahin he
 a lot of the NRC is included in the Citizenship Amendment Bill, so i don't think the two are different things
 pichley kuch dinon main is par hui charchaa ko aadhaar banaakar dekhen to mujhe lagata he ki log is bill ko lekar kuch zyada samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 He further said that the real intentions hidden within this bill are not reaching the people
 assam main enarasi main 12 lakh hindu chhot gaye isliye yah bill laayaa ja rahaa he
 The original intention of this bill is that it is a national level NRC
 is bill kaa sabase khatarnaak part yah he ki yah dharmik aadhaar par hona he
 This is simple equation 
 mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki vipaksh khulkar iskaa virodh nahin kar rahaa jabaki isamen bahut saare dar chupe hue hai
 Mandal continued his talk and said that my question is why this bill was prepared in this way, why three countries were left
 mere khyaal se afghanistan kaa isse koi masalaa hi nahin tha
 Why Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal were left
 ye sab padosi desh hai
 The reason is because everyone knows who were the minorities in these countries
 sirf ek community ko torget kiya ja rahaa he
 Talking about Bangladesh, Mandal said that in the last 10-12 years, show me where minorities in Bangladesh are being persecuted
 bangladesh hamaara behatar padosi mitra desh rahaa he
 If you go there, you see that minorities are living better
 mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa ki vipaksh is bill kaa agenda samaj kyon nahin paa rahaa he
 Opposing Mandal's view, BJP leader Chandra Bose said that India is not a hospice
 ham puure vishwa ke deshon ke un logon kaa swaagat nahin kar sakate jin par unke khud ke desh main pratadna hui ho
 We want to help those who were persecuted in those three countries
 bose ne aage kaha ki yah citigenship amendament bill antim nahin he
 It is being discussed, amendments will be made in it
 bijepi netaa bose ke is jawaab par mandal ne poocha ki agar yah antim nahin he to yah bill sansad main pesh hi kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 When you could not handle the 3 crore people of Assam, then how can you handle 130 crore people of the whole country
 yah upanyaas apane up-sheershak (mandi ke dinon main lav sex or dhokhe kii kahani) ke saath dibaakar banerjee kii charchit film alesady kaa hawala dene kii jarurat mahasoos karata he, par kisi paaramparik aiyaar-katha jaisi rochak or dam tham dene vaali kissagoi ke alaava yah upanyaas hamaare samay kii gambhir soochnaaon ko ham tak pahunchane vaala bahu-sanrachanaatmak arthpurna vrittant he
 Creating a building that forms the narrative time-line of the current reality, by placing one, many layers on top of each other with vigilance but flow
 sheershak se bahuton ko yah bhram ho saktaa he ki yah hindi ke prachlit upanyaason kii tarah kisi paatr ke jivan ko centre main rakhkar, saral katha-rekha main likhaa gaya upanyaas hoga
 But this novel conveys the daily report of a 'crime beat' in its outer text, with its creative courage from the valid concepts of Hindi novels, taking a risky distance, neutrality and dissonance
 yah pramukh or kuch ‘kendriya’ paatro ke jivan tak simatakar, madhyavarg kaa mahakavy banane ke laalach ko nirast karata he
 It is a poignant kaleidoscope on the savory of information that reaches us every day, the story of which, through its sudden and unexpected appearance, weaves an anecdote, which in the end is the changing mega-metro centric of today, ie after 1990
 Life becomes a serious narrative
 ise padhate hue kabhi shrilaal shukla kaa aadmi kaa jehar, kabhi jagdamba prasad dikshit kaa murda ghar, kabhi gopal ram gahamri or devakinandan khatri ke aiyaar kisson kaa samaran hota he
 At times it seems that Ibne Safi has become a novelist of Hindi literature
 jo pathak or aalochak dalal kii bivi ko, in bikhri-uljhi kathaon ke sthapaty ke bahari dhaanche kii parachhatti yaa sataha par se, apni puraani paath-pranali kii aankh se padhenge, unhen shuru main bahut duvidha hogi
 Is it 'pulp' or 'literature'? Ravi Bulle's latest novel is Pulp Hota Literature? Or would 'literature' be pulp? Initially, this confusion occurred to me as well, but this novel is 'un-putdownable'
 yani ise ek baar padhuya shuru kiya, to phir chhod nahin sakate
 The novel could also be the out-line script of a Bollywood film, but not the countless films like Satya showing the life of Mumbai's gutter, a realistic parallel film like a plausible thriller filled with serious details of the lives of humans living outside the margins
 ek ke baad duusare or duusare ke baad tisare or phir is tarah kai kai kisson-soochnaaon-khabaron ko ek par ek, kaushal ke saath, parat-dar-parat bithaate, kisi uljhe hue dhaagon kii gathree ko kholte-sulajhate hue yah upanyaas kai kathavriton ko ant main is daur ke prakat mahanagareey yatharth main visarjeet kar detaa he
 If you recall the classic-academic interpretation of 'modernism', it is a reality in which every person is cheated, and every person is cheating another
 yah dallalon, aparaadhiyon, hatyaron or ferbiyon ke bich janm lete or bujhate-mitate prem or tamaam maanviya samvednaaon ke traasad ant kii avasann or baichaiyn karne vaali kissagoi he
 After the information revolution, the universal mazzaal or 'global-nexus' of the innumerable technological mediums that deliver outside news and information has been believed to surround our lives with stories
 yah samay hajaaron rojaanaa kahaniyon kii gherebandi kaa anokhaa absard samay he
 Everyday morning newspapers, TV channels, the Internet and social networking sites are raining down a lot of stories like a cloud burst
 yah samay soochna or ghatnaon, yani news, information, phone-kals, twits or esemes ke ‘story’ ban jane kaa kolahal bharaa absard daur he
 And at such times, it is no longer easy to tell an anecdote or write a novel by tying together disparate or isolated information from each other
 ravi ne in bikhare-vicchhinn sutron ko ganth laga-lagaakar ek upanyaas main badalane ke liye jis ‘yukt’ kaa sahaara liya he, vah rochak he
 The 'sutradhar' is a family of cats that transform these stories into one-sidedness of a tale
 ek maa or uske chaar chhaune
 Their mutual dialogue and whisper is a changing parallel sequel in the realization of this novel
 or mahatvapurn yah he ki yah sambhawatah kisi roopak yaa eligri kii bhoomika usee tarah nibhaataa he, jaisaa ham puraani lokkathaon yaa natya main dekhte the
 The cats of the broker's wife appear to do 'chants' in dialogue in the same way as Kagabhusundi, Narada, shiva-parvati etc
 in the old story
 yah ravi kaa rochak ‘divaais he
 If any composition, art, music or cinema expresses its meaning after its end, it is Ravi's novel of indomitable jeejivisha of living and dying in the frontier of the metropolis
 yah madhyavarg kaa mahakavy nahin, samakaleen hindi katha main vanchit jivan kii maarmik shdharaviya he
 This opens the doors to new spaces, themes and possibilities for the story

 jaruri nahin he ki aapaki kadi mehnat kaa nateeja aapako us samay hi mil jaae

 com / 4rrumetvxa a senior MP from US President Barack Obama's Democratic Party has compared Edward Snowden, the US spy, to Mahatma Gandhi, saying he is engaged in the 'non-violent' act of 'civil disobedience'
 america main naagarik adhikaron kii himaayat karne vaale jon levis ne kaha kaha ki snowden ne savinay avagya kii parampara ko jari rakhaa he
 Lewis told the Guardian newspaper, 'while upholding the philosophy of non-violence, following the teachings of Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi and others, if you believe that something is not right, something is unfair and you believe in tradition, wrong laws
 If you are willing to disobey, then you have discretion
 aapke paas un kanoonon kii avagya karne kaa adhikaar he or keemat chukaane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Lewis, one of the surviving lieutenants of Congressman and Martin Luther King, said Snowden was engaged in an act of civil disobedience
 unhone kaha, ‘yah vahi cheez he jo hamane kiya tha
 i was arrested 40 times in the 60s
 jab se main congress main hum main chaar baar giraftaar hua hum
 Sometimes you should also work at your discretion
 ’ The batsman Virat Kohli says about himself that many things related to him were wrong earlier
 unke tatu, stylish kapade or afares kii zyada charchaa thi
 But these days only his bat is being threatened
 apane gusse ke liye badnaam rahe viraat kohli ne umr badhane ke saath- saath cricket or duniya, donon ko jeetna siikhaa he
 Know some such things of Virat that he himself has said
 2009 se pehle mujhe apane khel, apni kaabiliyat par yakeen nahin tha
 There was doubt as to whether i would be able to reduce the distance between the ball and the run later after playing slow
 lekin ab khud par vishwaas ho chalaa he
 i have learned to believe in my ability
 2
 Now i believe in challenging the fielders on the boundary
 isliye aap gym main training karte hai
 Doing fitness related things
 jab main thakaa hum or jiro par hum, to bhi zyada se zyada tej bhaag sakuun, isaki training letaa hum ormatch main yahi kaam aata he
 3
 mujhe bade shot khilne kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti he
 It is important for me to play low-risk innings for the sake of the team
 lekin aakraamak andaaj barkaraar rakhte hue
 i have been working on this balance for quite some time
 4
 i visualize, this is my strength
 main nahin jaanata isamen kuch aadhyatm jaisaa he yaa kuch or, lekin main khud se khub baaten karata hum
 As i prepare for my next innings, i imagine who is bowling and how i am facing him
 5
 i do not understand why i am not worried despite playing in front of 50-60 thousand people on the field
 main sab dekhtaa hum, lekin ati utsaah main nahin aata
 This thing makes me believe that you had to do this
 aap main in halaat main parform karne kii kaabiliyat he, kyonki aap avarodhon ke baavjood lakshya par focus kar paa rahe hai
 6
 main ye nahin chahta ki duniya mujhe aise khilaadi ke taur par yaad rakhe jo kabhi team india ke liye khelaa tha
 i want to set an example for all those who will come after us to play for the team
 7
 Australia is the most powerful team and i enjoy playing against them
 wo chunauti pesh karte hai or mujhe chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa acha lagata he
 But you cannot play well just thinking that you have scored the first runs against Australia
 8
 As a cricketer, your career is not very long, in such a time it is very important to enjoy it
 mere liye maidan main utarana, dabaav nahin balki mauka he
 i take it as a challenge, which i want to win
 ek khilaadi hone ke naate ye behad jaruri he ki aapako ye santushti mili ki aapane apni taraf se 120 fisadi diya
 9
 main puja-paath karne vaala lagata hum kya? main hairat main hum kyonki mere bare main kaaphi kuch galat tha
 i had tattoos, i wore stylish clothes
 lekin wo sab karnaa kaaphi aasaan tha
 It was difficult, so to improve my game everyday, that too regardless of the outcome and i did the same, i am doing the same
 10
 You get only six meters of six meters or 90 meters, run 6
 isliye hamaare liye jeetna jaruri he, ye nahin ki kaise jite
 Nobody says how many runs he defeated
 sabhi bolte hai ki india jiti yaa india haari

 jab is ghatana par jamkar bavaal hua tha
 Then the Leader of the Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, while giving a statement on this incident, said that the Indian government should take strong action against Pakistan
 sushamaa ne kaha tha ki bharat ko ek ke badale pakistani sena ke javaanon ke 10 sir laane chahie
 PM had mentioned in rallies that during this time, politics was also increased on this statement of Sushma
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan bhi bhartiya sena ke javaanon ke sir kaate jane kaa mudda chunaav prachaar kaa mudda bana tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said in rallies that Pakistan is beheading our soldiers and the government is feeding chicken biryani to the Pakistani PM

 In the Lok Sabha, Scindia said that the government is repeating the mistake again and again, nothing is being done to protect the soldiers on the border
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is baat par chup kyon hai
 He said that again and again terrorists are crossing this border, what is the central government doing
 is dauraan sindhiya ne kaha ki jo log pehle baaten kiya karte the ki ham ek ke badale das sir laaenge, pakistan ko munhtod jawaab denge
 What happened to that promise, now why are those people sitting in silence
 ab sawaal uthta he ki modi sarkaar pakistan par kya koi sakht kadam uthaaegi
 Is the time now that this time, by speaking more stringent than surgical strike, Pakistan should be stopped

 kisi bhi rajya main chuni hui sarkaar kaa ye adhikaar hota he ki vah kis adhikari ko rahane yaa kisko kaha rakhe
 On Monday, Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi transferred senior police officers
 isamen ek police adhikari patna ke aiji kundan krishnan hai, jinhen ab aties kaa pramukh banaaya gaya he
 It is said that behind the transfer of Kundan, when all the senior to the lower officers were removed in the Gandhi Maidan accident in Patna, Kundan was not transferred at that time only because of his political reach
 lekin, vijaydashami ke din ghatana ke baad maine dekha ki kundan kaise gandhi maidan se lekar piemasiech main apane matehat adhikariyon ke saath morchabandi kiye hue the
 His uniform was ripped off at the time of the incident and when the crowd at the pmch's Emergency Gate in plain clothes were restrained with the help of their body guards, many people pushed him along
 saamaanya halaat main agar aap varisht adhikari ke saath dhakka mukki karenge to police turant lathicharge kar detii he, lekin us samay bheed niyantran karnaa tha, na kii lathi charge karnaa
 Later, in an adjacent room, Kundan changed the clothes of the uniform manga and asked for three thousand rupees for medicines if he did not have the necessary medicine in the emergency ward
 us shaam patna ke esaspi, dm, diaiji, police ayukta sab nadaarad the
 Action was taken on everything but Kundan was ready
 haalanki rajya sarkaar ko laga ki unka tabadalaa na karnaa galat sandesh degaa
 But i believe that after the transfer, hardly any officer in Bihar or in the whole country will throw his clothes in the crowd, pay money and ask for medicine and try to save the lives of people by abusing and killing people
 main maanata hum ki kundan krishnan bahut lokapriy adhikari nahin rahe hai, lekin us shaam ke kaam ke badale purashkar ke badale maanjhi sarkaar ne ye kya kiya? After PM Modi had banned these notes on 8 November, the period for depositing these notes in banks was 30 December
 iske baad 31 march tak in noton ko rigerv bank of india main jamaa karavaaya ja saktaa he

 After the dual cameras, now the trend is of smartphones with bezelless display
 vivo, jo china kii smartphone mekar he
 The company has launched its flagship smartphone V7 Play with a low bezel display
 is smartphone ke rivyuu main ham jaanane kii koshish karenge ki kya vaaki main ye smartphone ummiido par khara utarataa he yaa nahin
 First of all, the performance key is that high-end processors are available in this budget smartphones, but it has a mid-range processor of Qualcomm
 multi tasking aasaan he
 Moving from one app to another is also easy
 lekin mushkil tab hoti he jab aap ek saath kai saare eps khol len
 This smartphone is definitely a little behind here
 kyonki is segment ke duusare smartphone thik thaak hai
 As we mentioned earlier, multi tasking is easy, ie if you are playing Asphalt and have to minimize and use another app then it is quite easy

 kyonki wolum wankar kii or woock kii kaa istemaal sabase zyada kiya jaataa he
 The matte black variant impresses and looks great
 yuasabi tip si kaa naa hona thodaa ajeeb he
 It has a micro USB connector
 chunki is segment main duusari companiyaan ab yuasabi tip si conector de rahi hai, isliye isaki kami aapako jarur khalegi
 Display The specialty of this smartphone is its display
 company ne har sambhav koshish kii he ki bejal ko kam se kam rakhaa jaae
 Using it you will feel that it is quite large
 phone ke mukaable disple badi lagati he, kyonki isamen bejal nahin die gaye hai
 The display is bright and you can use it comfortably in the sun, there will be no problem
 haalanki screen thodi se khichi hui lagegi
 Since the length of the screen is more due to the lower bezel, you will feel that the screen is stretched
 screen kaa rejyolushan phul echdi he or screen 2
 The 5D is curved which makes it easy to use
 is segment ke lihaaj se isaki bejal les disple ko prabhavi kaha ja saktaa he
 Because smartphones without a bezel display in the market are few and mostly expensive
 camerayah smartphone bejal les hone ke saath saath selfi centric divaais bhi he
 For the selfie, it has a 24-megapixel front camera
 trend badal chukaa he ek samay main companiyaan apane smartphone ke rier main bhi 24 megapixl kaa camera nahin detii thim
 This is probably the first smartphone in the Indian market to have a 24-megapixel selfie camera at the front
 camera interphes vivo ke duusare smartfones jaisaa hi he
 We have used different modes for this
 isamen butification mod bhi he jo prabhavit nahin karata he
 Although the selfie is good on normal mode
 is smartphone main group selfi ke liye ek acha feechar diya gaya he
 It also has a panaroma mode for selfie
 yani aap camere ko move karke group selfi le sakate hai
 Regardless of how many people are in the group, the selfie of all people can be clicked through this mode
 batrimixd yuj main aap ek din ise chalaa sakate hai, lekin agar aap power yujar hai
 That is, while gaming and taking photography all day selfie, the battery will run out soon and will not run for a day
 kul milakar iske disple, dizin, bild quality or selfi camera ko chhod den to isamen prabhavit karne ke laayak zyada chijen nahin hai
 Its price seems a little high from above
 agar aap selfi lover hai or mobile par videos or films dekhte hai to yah aapke liye behatar sabit ho saktaa he

 south dilil kii meyar kamaljit saharaavat ne dainik vetan bhogi safai karmchaariyon ko turant niyamit kiye jane ke dilli sarkaar ke aadesh ko adhuraa bataaya he
 He has said that the Delhi government has issued the order, but has not yet released any amount for the economic burden on the MCD to fulfill it
 meyar kamaljit ke mutabik is aadesh ko lagu karne ke kaaran south emsidi par padane vaale vittiya bhaar ko puraa karne ke liye dilli sarkaar ne koi raashi ab tak nahin di he
 This order will create an imbalance in the financial position of South MCD
 meyar ne bataaya ki vartmaan main niyamit safai karmchaaree ko 26,202 ru kii selary har maheene milti he jabaki dainik bhogi safai karmchaaree ko 13,764 ru die ja rahe hai
 The corporation will have to pay an additional Rs 12,438 on regularizing a daily casual employee
 is prakaar 8526 vetan bhogi karmchaariyon ko niyamit karne par south emsidi ko har saal kareeb 130 karod rupye atirikt dene honge
 If you add dearness allowance etc
 to this amount, then this amount can reach Rs 140 crore
 meyar ne kaha ki vetan bhogi karmchaariyon ko niyamit kiye jane se har saal kareeb 140 karod rupye se adhik raashi kii jarurat hogi
 Therefore, if the Delhi government is serious about this order and wants regularization to be a permanent system, then it should at present issue 450 crore rupees to the South MCD for the next three years
 meyar ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar ne yah aadesh jari karte hue yah spasht nahin kiya ki wo kab kitni rashiemaidiko jari karegi
 In such a situation, the MCD is not in a position to bear the additional load
 meyar ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ko ye aadesh jari karne se pehle vartmaan safai karmchaariyon ko puraa vetan jari karne ke khate main vittiya vyavastha kerani chahie thi
 The Mayor said that the Delhi government released financial assistance to the corporation under the scheme of mechanization and strengthening of the sanitation system in the last years

 The story begins with a carton and a bag found in the garbage dump
 jab donon ko kholaa gaya to usamen saat tukdon main padi ek ladki kii laash mili
 There was also no sign for identification
 sawaal tha ki aakhirkaar laash kis kii thi
 Who transformed a living awake human into seven pieces and brought them to the garbage heap
 ab police laash kii pahchaan karne main jute gai, aasapaas ke ilaake ke tamaam gumshuda logon kii list nikaali gai lekin kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 The volash found in a residential area of delhi was cut into seven pieces
 use cartoon box or bag main pack kiya gaya tha
 It was clear from the corpse that the corpse belonged to a girl
 lekin shuruaati chaanbin main naa to marane vaali kii pahchaan pataa chalati he or naa hi qaatilon kaa koi suraag hi miltaa he
 But then suddenly some Herf written on the cartoon gives the first clue to the police
 ye darasal ek courier company kaa pataa tha
 So will the police reach the murderer only through this address? On June 21, 2018, at 8:30 am, Sarita Vihar, Delhi, in this garbage bordering a dense residential area, people noticed two things that are usually garbage Is not in the pile of ye thi ek bada sa bag or bag ke paas ek packed cartoon box
 But not only did these two things attract the attention of the people, but people were also disturbed by the stink
 logon kaa maathaa thanka or unhone police ko ittila di
 In the next few minutes, Delhi Police was on the scene
 lekin bag or box ko khangalate hi pulisavaalon ke qadam thithak gaye
 a girl's body was in the bag
 wo bhi saat alag-alag tukdon main
 Arms, legs, head, neck all different
 police ne laash baraamad kii or use postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Apparently, the way the corpse was cut into seven separate pieces and stuffed into bags and cartoons, it was clear that the matter was murder
 lekin maranevaali ladki koun thi? kahaan rahati thi? uskaa qatl kisne kiya? laash ke itane tukade kin halaat main kiye? ye sabhi sawaal abhi ansulajhe the
 However, in order to know the answers to these questions and to reach the killer, the police had to first identify the girl who died
 lekin dikkat ye thi ki aas-paas ke logon se poochtacha karne or bag or cartoon kii puri kahani bataane ke baavjood marane vaali ladki kii shinaakht nahin ho pai
 Even the clothes the girl wore, the police showed those clothes to the people nearby, but no clue was found anywhere
 is koshish main kai rose nikal gaye
 Meanwhile, during the investigation, the police caught sight of something that made him hope that it might provide a clue of his death
 qaatilon ne jis cartoon box memlash ke tukdebhar kar phenke the, us par ek courier company kaa pataa likhaa tha
 The police thought that perhaps some way out of this address
 wo foran gurugram main us courier company ke daftar pahunchi or vahaan usne company ke afasaron ko cartoon box kii tasviren dikhain
 Incidentally, the courier identified the box and stated that one of his customers had booked the parcel from UAE in such a large box
 customer kaa naam tha javed akhtar
 Now the police reached Aligarh at Javed Akhtar's house directly at the address of the courier
 yahaan javed naa sirf police ko mil gaya, jabaki apane cartoon box kii tasviir bhi pahchaan lee
 He said that three years ago, he had ordered some items from UAE in several such cartun boxes
 inamen se kuch box jahaan usne apni naukaraani ko die the vahiin kuch box dilli ke shahinbaag vaale ghar rakhwai thim
 Some boys lived on rent in that house of Shaheenbagh
 ab police ne dilli ke shaheen baag kaa rukh kiya
 All the hopes of the police had now come to this house
 jo bhi suraag milanaa tha yaheen se milanaa tha
 The police team reached out to Javed Akhtar's maid
 vahaan par khaali box mil gaye, iske baad police jab javed ke shaheen baag sthit ghar par pahunchi to vahaan taala laga tha
 This deepened the suspicion of the police on Sajid Ali
 police ne aas-paas ke logon se sajid ke bare main jaankaree jutani shuru kii, to pataa chalaa ki usne vahaan logon se kaha he ki wo ye ghar khaali karke ja rahaa he
 Now the police was looking for Sajid Ali Ansari
 police kii kai timen uski talash main jute gai
 And finally he got caught by the police
 pakade jane ke baad sajid ne qatl kii jo kahani police ko bataai wo chaunkaa dene vaali he
 Sajid Ali told the police that he often had a quarrel with his wife
 jhagade kii do vajah thi ek to uskaa kisi duusari ladki ke saath sambandh or uski berogari
 For this reason, he killed his wife
 20- 21 june kii raat ko usne apni patni kii galaa dabaa kar hatya kar di
 Then together with his two brothers, he cut several pieces of his corpse
 or laash ko ek parcel box main daal kar thikaane laga diya

 beete kareeb ek dashak se bhartiya janata party ke garh ban gaye goa main mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad party ko bada jhatka laga
 The biggest worry for the party was who would become the successor of Manohar Parrikar, for which meetings were held throughout the day
 party adhyaksh amit shah se lekar varisht mantri nitin gadakari ne kai baithken kii or tab jaakar raat do baje bijepi ke yuva netaa pramod saavant ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Goa, with 40 assembly seats, held elections in 2017, when the BJP was away with a majority and came to power with the help of an alliance
 lekin, manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad saathiyon ko manaanaa naammumkin ho rahaa tha or saath main hi apane vidhayakon ko bhi bachaane kii chunauti thi
 That is why Pramod Sawant became the Chief Minister
 vahiin sahyogi dalon maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke sudin dhavalikaar or goa forward party ke vijay saradesai ko upmukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 The round of meetings lasted from morning to night
 
 
 bataa den ki manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad se hi rajya main satta kaa sangharsh shuru ho gaya tha
 The Congress, with 14 mlas, had written a letter to the Governor claiming to form the government, but Nitin Gadkari was in Goa on behalf of the BJP and held frequent meetings with BJP mlas and other coalition leaders
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye pehle pradesh adhyaksh vinay tendulkar kaa naam saamne aayaa, lekin shaam tak pramod saavant ke naam par muhar lag gai thi
 And late at two o'clock, Pramod Sawant was sworn in, accompanied by 11 ministers
 kaisaa he nai cabinet raajnneetik sameekaran?aapako bataa den ki congress ne somvaar subah daawa kiya tha ki bhaajapa ke paas bahumat nahin he yahi kaaran he ki sabase badi party hone ke naate congress ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka mili
 The BJP had a crisis to convince the alliance partners, in which it was successful
 guuruuvaar ko jo shapath lee gai he, usamen pramod saavant bhaajapa se, dipti siem vijay saradesai goa forward party se, maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke sudin dhavlikar dipti siem ke alaava teen mantri GFP, 2 MGP, 5 BJP or 2 nirdaleey mantriyon ne shapath lee he
 It is clear that for now the crisis for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Goa is averted, although the test of proving majority in the Assembly is yet to be done
 jharkhand ke koderma main sandigdh paristhitiyon main mrit pai gayi dilli kii patrkaar nirupama pathak kii kathith hatya ke aarope main jail main band uski maa sudhaa pathak kii jamaanat yachika par sunwaayee nau june tak taal di gai he
 District and Sessions Judge MN Singh has ordered the police to present the case diary, forensic report and post mortem report before the court by June 9
 adaalat kaa maananaa he ki sudhaa pathak kii jamaanat yachika par dastavejon ke adhyayan ke baad faisla kiya jayega
 Significantly, the post mortem report said that 22-year-old Nirupama was murdered
 is maamle main uski maa sudhaa pathak ko bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 (hatya), 201 (subut mitaanaa) or 120bi (aapraadhik shadyantr) kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 While everyone is praying for happiness and progress in 2019, this year is also very important for Indian politics and different political parties are expecting better results
 is saal desh ke saamne sirf aam chunaav hi nahin hai, balki 8 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi hai
 Three of these important states are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav ke alaava andhra pradesh, haryana, jammu- kashmir, maharashtra, jharkhand, odisha, arunachal pradesh or sikkim main vidhansabha chunaav hue
 Of these, the BJP formed governments on its own in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, while the government formed in alliance with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir
 arunachal pradesh main bhi bijepi ne sarkaar banaai, jabaki yahaan zyada siten congress ko praapt hui thim
 The Biju Janata Dal had its magic in Odisha
 vahiin, andhra pradesh kaa vibhaajan (2 june 2014) hone se telugana vajood main aayaa or andhra vidhansabha do hisson main bant gai
 Andhra Pradesh got 175 seats and Telangana got 119 seats
 andhra pradesh main chandrababu naidu ko telugu desham party kii sarkaar chalaane kaa avasar mila, jabaki telugana main ke
 Chandrasekhar Rao ran the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government
 haalanki, isi saal (2018) unhone telugana vidhansabha bhang kar di, jiske chalate madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or mizoram ke saath yahaan bhi chunaav hue or phir se tiares ne prachand bahumat hasil kiya
 In such a situation, despite the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, this time also assembly elections are proposed in 8 states in 2019
 in teen rajyon par najaradonon pramukh dalon bijepi or congress ke nazariye se dekha jaae to maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand ke vidhansabha chunaav behad mahatvapurn hai
 While Maharashtra has a total of 288 assembly seats, it has 48 Lok Sabha seats, which is the highest after UP in terms of numbers
 maharashtra main is baar halaat kaaphi alag hai
 On one hand, bjp's ally Shiv Sena is rebel
 vahiin, duusari taraf congress gathbandhan majboot ho rahaa he
 Sharad Pawar's NCP, which has a major say in state politics, has announced to contest elections in alliance with Congress
 yani gathbandhan ke gathjod ne soobe kii siyasat ko dilachasp mode par laa diya he
 Let us know that in the 2014 assembly, BJP won 122 seats, Shiv Sena 63, Congress 42 and NCP 41 seats
 haryana main mili bijepi ko sattavidhansabha siton kii sankhya ke hisaab se chota rajya maane jane vaala haryana, rashtriya raajnneeti kii ahm kadi mana jaataa he
 There are 90 seats in the assembly and in the 2014 elections, BJP won 47 seats, INLD 19 and Congress 15 seats

 The AAP has again warned of agitation after meeting social activist Anna Hazare
 kumaar vishwaas or sanjay singh anna se milane ralegan siddhi gaye the
 After meeting him, Anna said that the two leaders told him that if the central government interrupts once again, then he should be ready for the movement again
 is par anna ne donon netaaon se kaha ki dekhte hai, aap apana kaam kiijie
 After this, Prashant Bhushan also met Anna
 anna bole bill acha, par teen suzav bhi dieaap netaaon kii safai sunne ke baad anna ne kaha ki bill acha he, lekin yah vah nahin jisaki sankalpana ramlila maidan main kii gai thi
 Anna has also given three suggestions regarding this bill
 1
 The Lokpal selection committee should include at least seven members, as stated in the 2011 draft
 2
 The High Court judge should have the authority to investigate
 jaanch cameti kii report vidhansabha main do tihaai bahumat se paarit hone par lokapal ko hataaya ja sake
 3
 yadi shikaayat juthi yaa galat ho to shikaayat karne vaale ko ek saal kii jail ho
 This provision is in Uttarakhand
 vivadah yah andolan vaala bill nahinkumar vishwaas or sanjay apane janalokapal bill par anna ko safai dene pahunche hai
 The Kejriwal government introduced Yehbil Assembly on Monday itself
 lekin aap ke purv netaprashanth bhushan is par sawaal uthaa rahehain
 He has said that there are no provisions in this bill for which the movement took place in Ramlila Maidan
 kuch hi din pehle anna ne bhi kaha tha- acha hua main kejariwal se alag ho gaya
 This is not the bill that laid its foundation in the Ramlila Maidan
 vajahah centre kyon daal saktaa he badhakendre sarkaar isliye baadha daal sakati he kyonki is bill main lokapal ko bhrashtachar ke maamalon main saansadon, vidhayakon samet centre sarkaar ke afasaron ke khilaaf bhi jaanch ke adhikaar die gaye hai
 It is believed that the Center is hardly ready to agree on this provision
 yah bill abhi uparajyapal ke paas jayega
 He can also return it and send it to the Ministry of Home Affairs if agreed
 grih mantralay ise manjuur kar raashtrapati ko bhejega, jiske baad yah kanoon ban paaegaa
 Promise: This is the same bill, controversy has been described by you as per your election promise
 aap ne kaha he ki iske praavdhaan vahi hai, jinaki bhoomika 2011 ke janalokapal andolan main taiyaar kii gai thi
 It empowers the Lokpal to conduct investigations against any government employee working in Delhi
 phir bhale hi ve centre ke hi afasar kyon na hon
 This was the main demand from the Jan Lokpal movement of 2011
 2011 se kya alag, jis par vivaad he1
 No legal action can be taken against the Lokpal
 use hataane ke liye mahabhiyog laayaa ja saktaa he or vidhansabha main do tihaai bahumat se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Whereas in the 2011 resolution that if the Supreme Court is convicted, it can be removed
 2
 There is a question on the selection committee appointing the Lokpal
 isamen mukhyamantri, vidhansabha adhyaksh, vipaksh ke netaa or dilli hoicourt ke chif justise shaamil hai
 Whereas in 2011, a seven-member selection committee was proposed
 3
 The investigation committee is also in dispute
 kyonki 2011 main taiyaar masaude main kaha gaya tha ki yah puri tarah swatantra hogi
 The new bill provides that a separate wing will be formed in which officers will be appointed from the government itself

 Finally, the police of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar could not catch Manoj Baitha, accused of the death of nine children
 manoj baitha ne sarender kiya or filhal unka ilaaj patna medical college hospital main chal rahaa he
 Manoj Baitha agreed to surrender after the assurances of some BJP leaders and the promise of the police not to relax treatment
 manoj baitha ko bihar police se zyada mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or susheel modi ko kyon he talash ? However Manoj Baitha said that he was not driving
 jahaan tak unhen patna laane kaa sawaal he, us par rajya police kaa kahana he ki mujaffarpur main rakhana aasaan nahin tha kyonki vahaan kai ghayal bhartee hai or unke parivaar vaale baitha ko dekhakar kuch bhi kar sakate the lekin baitha ke sarender se filhal rajya sarkaar kii mashkil khatm hoti nahin dikhti
 The Chimbihar BJP first denied the relationship with Manoj Baitha, now suspended from the party! bihar main bolero se kuchalakar hui 9 bacchon kii maut ke maamle main bhaajapa netaa manoj baitha ne buudhvaar ko police stesan jaakar sarender kiya

 haalanki manoj baitha ne kaha ki wo gaadi nahin chalaa rahaa tha
 As far as bringing them to Patna is concerned, the state police says that it was not easy to keep in Muzaffarpur because there are many injured recruits and their family members could do anything by looking at Baitha but the surrender of Baitha is currently done by the state government
 The cycle does not seem to end
 tippaniyambihar bijepi ne pehle manoj baitha se sambandh nakaare, ab party se nilambit kar diya! BJP leader Manoj Baitha surrendered on Wednesday to the police station in connection with the death of 9 children who were crushed by Bolero in Bihar

 janata dal united (JDU) kii rashtriya parishad ke khule adhiveshan main nitish kumaar ne kaha ki kisi ke paas JDU ko todane kii takat he? iske liye vidhayak, emelsi, saansad sab se do tihaai todna padega, varanaa sadsyta hi chali jaaegi
 He challenged Sharad Yadav that if he has support, break the party and show it
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki unhen sharad yadav ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he
 At a distance of a few kilometers, Sharad Yadav was holding a Jan Adalat Sammelan, but Nitish Kumar explained to him in gestures what his strength was? Bihar Chief Minister Nitish said that the party has 71 mlas, two mps, nine Rajya Sabha mps and 30 mlcs with us
 is dauraan nitish kumaar ne sharad yadav ke puraane din bhi yaad dilaae
 He said that Sharad Yadav was made president by merging the Samata Party with Janata Dal u in the year 2003, while Samata Party was the national president at the time, George Fernandes
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki saal 2004 main ye madhepura se chunaav haar gaye the
 He was then sent to the Rajya Sabha
 unke liye kya nahin kiya
 Janta Dal remained the national president of u for so many years
 nitish kumaar ne sharad par waar karte hue kaha ki hamase poocha jaataa he ki janadesh mahagathbandhan ko mila tha
 He said that we want to ask why the Grand Alliance got a mandate
 bihar kaa vikaas karne ke liye yaa ek parivaar kii khushhaali ke liey mandet ke ham bhi hakdaar he
 With whom the Chief Minister of JDU, Jitibihar of the same said that it is also being said about us that we have no support base, whereas the Janata Dal u has its own base
 jiske saath jediu hota he, vahi chunaav main jeetta he
 Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar gave one reason for the break-up of the alliance
 unhone kaha ki baar-baar yah kahkar apamaanit kiya jaataa tha ki aap mukhyamantri bane rahenge or wo bhi mere saamne
 What would be more insulting than this? It was said that the peripheries are chief ministers
 badi party hone kaa bahut gumaan tha
 Tell me a leader of our party, who insulted the top RJD leader, but i do not know what was said? i was declared a leader after Mulayam Singh came to the house by making a Chief Minister
 , But also said that i am drinking poison
 ye bhram paalate he ki alpsankhyak vot unka he
 We do not work for votes
 sab dharm ko samaan samajhate hai
 No one has done as much work as we have done for the minorities
 bihar main sikhon kaa koun sa vot he? lekin prakaash parv hamane manaaya, to log yaad karte he
 We do not need to read the text of secularism from anyone, who see the people as voters, they do not do good to the society
 JDU ko todane kii takat kisi main nahithish kumaar ne kaha ki wo kehete hai ki janata dal you tod denge
 The Chief Minister challenged that anyone has the power to break the JDU? For this, MLA, MLC, MP will have to break two thirds, otherwise the membership will be lost
 bhrashtachar par main koi samjhauta nahin kar saktaa
 Everyone knows this and our party has the same idea
 isliye hamane endie main jane kaa faisla kiya
 i never thought of power in my mind
 ham apane ko janata kaa sevak maanate hai
 Nothing is yours
 ham raajnneeti karte hai
 Work to improve society
 pehle hi bataa diya tha-dedh saal chalegaa mahagathbandhananithish kumaar ne tejasvi yadav ke bare main kaha ki agar vah istipha de detaa, to oonchaiyon par jaataa
 We talked to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and said do something, which will lead to the Grand Alliance
 aapane adhyadesh phada he, lekin ham tab bhi chup rahe
 He was forced to resign, but nothing was decided beforehand
 bijepi kii taraf se ofer aayaa or hamane vidhayak dal kii baithak main sabase poocha or sweekaar kar liya
 Nothing was decided beforehand
 ise kudarat ne banaaya
 Many people used to ask us while making the Grand Alliance that it will work? Then we said that we will run for one and a half years

 After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have said that an old friend is better than new friends, but Russia is now on its way to China
 bricks sammelan main pakistan ko aatankwaad kii vajah se alag-thalag karne ke mudde par rus ne bharat kaa samarthan karne kii bajaay chuppi saadhe rakhi
 According to the news published in 'times of India', China had already closed the path to bring the name of jaish-e-mohammad and lashkar-e-taiba to Goa Declaration
 lekin rus ne bhi pakistan ke in donon aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko lekar bharat ke prastaav par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 While the BRICS countries are committed to accepting the list of terrorist organizations declared by the UN Security Council
 rus kii chuppi ke parinamswarupabharat bricks summit mempakistan ko us tarah se gher nahin sakaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 This changed attitude of Russia is also due to its increased proximity with Pakistan recently
 pakistan ke saath rus ne anti- teror eksrasij bataakar kai sainya abhyaas kiye hai
 al-nusra's name included in the manifesto, Russia may not have helped India include jaish-e-mohammed in the Goa Declaration, but has supported the declaration of Syrian's jabhat-al-nusra organization as a terrorist organization
 yah isliye kyonki rus syria main lagaataar al-nusra ko apana nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 The al-nusra organization has been waging a continuous uprising in Syria to topple Bashar-es Assad's government
 al-nusra kii hi tarah sanyukt raashtra ne jaish-e-mohammad or lashkar-e taiyaba ko bhi pratibandhit ghoshit kiya hua he
 Please tell that jaish-e-mohammed took responsibility for the terror attacks in Uri and Pathankot
 goa diclaration ke aane se thik ek din pehle vladimir putin ne piem modi ko yah aashwaasan diya tha ki ve aisa kuch nahin karenge jisase bharat ke hiton ko nuksaan ho
 But Foreign Ministry Secretary Amar Sinha admitted that there was no consensus between the two countries to include Pakistan-based terrorist organizations in the declaration
 kyonki in sanghathanon se duusare deshon ko koi nuksaan nahin hota
 The fate of the Valley of Jammu and Kashmir, which has been unaffected by the terrorist conspiracies of Pakistan, is now changing
 ab tak algaavvaadiyon ke samarthak rahe kashmiri ab mukhyadhara kii ore badhane lage hai
 The Kashmiri people who have been pelted against the security forces till now, have started supporting the security forces against the terrorists
 ek din pehle hi surakshabalon ne kashmir ke uri main badi aatankwaadi sajeesh ko naakaam karte hue chaar aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 This is a big success for the security forces in the operation against terrorism, but the biggest success is that the security forces joined the common Kashmiris in this operation
 suraksha balon ne aatankiyon ke khilaaf chal raheoparation ol outke tahat ravivaar ko uri sector main chaar aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 But for the security forces, the success of the terrorists in this encounter is a big success
 sutron ke mutabik jaise hi aatankwaadi uri ke is gaanv main ghuse sthaneey logon ne suraksha balon ko alert kar diya
 As soon as the security forces blocked the area and started the operation to wipe out the terrorists
 abhiyaan ke dauraan sthaneey logon ne gaanv main idhar-udhar bhaag-chhip rahe aatankiyon kii sateek lokation kii jaankaree dene main suraksha balon kii madad kii
 On the basis of these inputs from the local Kashmiris, the security forces put the terrorists in hiding
 suraksha balon ne ghati se aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya karne ke liye kuch hi pehle oparation olout shuru kiya he
 The biggest success of this operation is that the security forces are getting the support of common Kashmiris
 is saal aatankiyon kekai cmanderon sahit 156 se zyada aatankwaadiyonko maar giraane main suraksha balon ko sthaneey logon se mili jaankaree kaa bada haath rahaa he
 Accurate information about the commanders of terrorist organizations one after the other has given considerable relief to the security forces
 jabaki kuch hi samay pehle tak aatankiyon se saath muthbhed ke dauraan suraksha balon ko patharbaajon se nibatna hota tha, jiskaa phayda uthaakar kai baar aantki bhaagane main kaamyaab ho jate the
 In such a situation, the arrival of the local people with the security forces suggests that the valley's structure is changing and that the local Kashmiris, once the supporters of separatists, now want to join the mainstream
 yah sthaneey kashmiriyon kaa sahyog hi he, jiske kaaran pichley ek saal se pakistani aatankiyon ke liye kashmir ghati main movement karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he

 According to the court, this ban on the sale of firecrackers will continue till 1 November after Diwali
 court ke faisle ke mutabik yah kadam isliye uthaaya gaya he jisase aankalan kiya ja sake ki kya deepawali par pataakhon ko jalaane se shahar main pradooshan kaa str bad jaataa he
 Impressed by this decision of the court, Delhi's cracker traders have approached the court that they have invested their money for this seasonal business
 court main daayar yachika ke mutabik dilli main 100 se adhik pataakhaa kaarobaariyon kaa daawa he ki bikri par cell se unhen 5 lakh rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 So they should be allowed to break crackers this year
 puraani dilli ke 47 varshiya harjit singh chhabda beete 20 varshon se dilli main pataakhaa bechney kaa license le rahe hai
 This year, they have bought and kept fireworks from the supplier to sell crackers on Deepawali
 lihaaja, court ke faisle ke baad unka puraa paisa dub jayega
 But Harjeet Singh says that if the decision is not taken back by the court, then he will forcefully distribute the purchased cracker to beggars and poor in Delhi
 isse unka godaam khaali ho jayega lekin pataakhaa kharidne main unki laagat dub jaaegi

 haalanki dilli main kharaab pradooshan ke liye sirf deepawali ke pataakhe jimmedaar nahin hai
 In Haryana, the pollution level of Delhi also increases due to the fire by the farmers during this period

 There are three major economies in Asia

 " Amid the ongoing controversy over the Land Acquisition Bill, Union Minister Kalraj Mishra on Tuesday claimed that the farmers agree with the bill, but some people are misleading them and engaged in propaganda
 sookshm, laghu evam madhyam udhyam mantri mishra ne kaha, 'kisaan hamaari baat se sahamat hai
 People are misleading and propagating them
 ' unase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak yadi itnaa hi acha he to kisaan uskaa virodh kyon kar rahe hai? unhone kaha, 'yah kanoon kisaanon ke liye hitkaari hoga
 Their economic security will be ensured, but the Congress and some other parties suffer from frustration and are doing politics in the name of farmers
 'mishra ne kaha ki yah mahasoos hone ke baad ki unke paas koi mudda nahin bachaa he, congress or anya dal kendra sarkaar kii ore se kisaanon ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye sakaaratmak kanoonee praaroop ko lekar andolan par utaaru ho gaye hai
 He clarified that the Land Acquisition Bill is a modified form of 2013 law
 san 1894 ke baad 2013 main bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon bana
 In the meantime, who has ruled the most, everyone knows, but those who ruled the most did not pay attention to amending the law
 calraj mishra ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii adhyakshata main 1999 main hui kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak main vidheyak kaa masauda paarit karaane kii koshish kii gai thi, lekin us samay sarkaar main bijepi ke sahyogi dalon ne vidheyak kaa virodh kiya tha
 He said that this bill is not correct
 unhone kaha ki 2013 kaa kanoon afratfari main banaaya gaya tha
 Although BJP had supported it at the time, later Chief Ministers of Congress ruled states like Haryana, Maharashtra etc
 wrote to the then Prime Minister saying that the law is very complex, it should be simplified
 unhone bataaya ki kendra sarkaar ne rajyon ke gramin vikaas mantriyon kii ek baithak bulaai he
 In it, everyone said that the bill should be simplified because neither the farmer nor the development works will be benefited by this law in the current format
 isiilie ham sanshodhit vidheyak laaye taaki puraane kanoon kii kamiyon ko dur kiya ja sake or gramin buniyadi dhaanche kaa vikaas kiya ja sake
 Mishra said that in the 2013 Act, there were 13 projects which were exempted, but the amended bill has included 13 projects and now the land acquired for these projects will also be given four times the market rate
