 is bich party adhyaksh amit shah shanivaar se 95 dinon ke liye puure bharat ke daure par niklenge, jis dauraan vah 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kii ranneeti banaaenge or party 2014 main jin sthanon par haari thi vahaan 120 seat laane par dhyaan kendrit karenge
 a day before his visit to Jammu, the BJP president said that he would spend time in states for one to three days, depending on the electoral importance
 rajyon ko chunavi mahatv ke hisaab se teen shreniyon main baanta gaya he
 He said, 'for the places where we lost in 2014, we have set a target of winning 120 seats
 mere daure main hamaare sanghathan kii shakti kaa jayja lene par dhyaan kendrit hoga or puure desh main vichaardhaara or chunavi apil ke vistaar par dhyaan diya jayega
 Shah is mainly focusing on states like West Bengal where he returned last night after spending three days
 'bhaajapa ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main odisha, telugana, kerala or pashchim bengal main 102 main se mahaj chaar siton par jeet darj kii thi
 He also hinted at a reshuffle in the organization as many officials have become ministers in the Uttar Pradesh government
 darasal bijepi ke chanakya maane jane vaale or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah panchayat se lekar nagarpalika chunaav hote hue sansad tak har chunaav kaa sanchaalan apane haath main rakhte hai
 In his recent address to the National Executive held in Bhubaneswar, he had cleared his intention and his ambition for the party
 unhone kaha tha ki party kaa svarnim yug tabhi aayega jab desh ke har rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar ban jaaegi
 Amit Shah's eyes are now on 2019 when he wants to see Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister again
 uttar pradesh kii jeet ne shah ko apane sapane ke sach hone ke sanket to die hai, lekin iske liye mehnat abhi se kerani hogi wo jaanate hai
 Moving in this direction, Amit Shah has set his smoke show
 bijepi adhyaksh aane vaale teen maheenon main desh ke sabhi rajya kaa daura karenge
 According to sources, the states for this tour have been divided into three categories
 1
 Where BJP is in government
 2
 Where the NDA has a government
 3
 Where there is a government of the opposition
 iske alaava rajyon ke aakaar ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 Very large states, large states and small states
 isi aadhaar par ye faisla liya jayega ki amit shah kahaan kitna samay bithaayenge
 In very large states they will stay for two to three days whereas in small states they can spend a day
 mahatyapurna ye he wo agle teen maheenon main har rajya kaa daura karenge
 During this time, they will meet the leaders and workers of the state and take their feedback and create a feeling that the party leadership wants to take everyone along at all levels in the organization

 At the same time, he will also discuss with the intellectuals of the area and will also interact with the media
 iske alaava in mulakaaton main kuch aise log bhi shaamil kiya jaaenge jo padaadhikari bhale na hon lekin jamini halaat par acchhee pakad rakhte hai

 ekmaatr apwaad tripura ho saktaa he jahaan chunaav hone vaale hai or bijepi vampanth ke is garh main apana paanv jamaana chaahati he
 It is clear that Amit Shah, who is considered an election machine, does not want to leave any quarrel in preparation for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on one side, while he does not want to give any chance to the scattered opposition that they will be united and if such before the elections Even if the situation arises, the party should be ready to face them at all levels before the elections

 sex scandle maamle main fanse dilli sarkaar ke purv mantri sandip kumaar ko teen din kii police hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 Earlier, his personal secretary Praveen Kumar was taken into custody by the police
 sandip ko court main pesh karne ke baad sanjay gandhi aspataal main medical jaanch ke liye le jaaya gaya
 Sandeep said that very soon the truth will be revealed
 dilli police ne shanivaar der raat unhen dushkarm or bhrashtachar sahit kai aaropon main giraftaar kiya tha
 Delhi Police presented the accused Sandeep Kumar before the duty magistrate in Rohini court at around four o'clock on Sunday
 rohinee court ke room number-128 main dilli police or sandip kumaar ke vakil ke bich tikhi bahes hui
 At the beginning of the debate, Delhi Police demanded a 14-day police remand of Sandeep Kumar from the court
 sandip kumaar ke vakil ne fouran iskaa virodh kiya
 However, an interesting turn came during the hearing when the court started reprimanding the Delhi Police
 court ke bheetar hui bahes ke ansh-duty magistrate ne police se poocha ki kya aapane mahila se poocha ki usko kaise pataa chalaa ki video banaaya gaya? is par police ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki mahila ne die bayaan main bataaya ki sandip kumaar nerashan cardbanavaane ke bahaane use bulaayaa or phir uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 Police said, according to the recorded statements of the woman, the accused former minister had also promised her family a job
 duty magistrate-naukari kaa laalach dene ke bahaane shaareerik sambandh banaae gaye, FIR main ye baat kyon nahin likhi gai he? bajaay iske likhaa gaya he ki mahila ke colddrink main kuch milaayaa gaya tha?police-mahila ke bayaan ke mutabik, wo 7 baje sandip kumaar ke ghar gai thi
 There was none other than Sandeep Kumar in the house
 aaropee ne mahila ko ek kamare ke andar bulaayaa or pine ko colddrink di
 After which accused Sandeep Kumar told not to worry about the woman and to settle her family
 mahila ko jhansa dekar sandip kumaar ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 Duty Magistrate - Is it seen in the video that some kind of intoxicating substance has been added to the cold drink given to the woman? Police - No
 duty magistrate-sandip kumaar kii 14 dinon kii police hiraasat kyon? kya aaropee ne naukari dene kaa vaada kiya? or kya praveen kumaar ne aaropee ko blackmel kiya, lekin baat na maanane par praveen kumaar ne video viral kar diya?police-maamla sangeen he or in sabhi pahaluon kii jaanch ke liye police ko thodaa vakt chahie
 Hence the police demand 14 days police custody of accused Sandeep Kumar
 dilli police se sawaal jawaab ke baad duty magistrate ne sandip kumaar ke vakil ko bhi apni baat rakhane kaa mauka diya
 Sandeep's lawyer Nitin Ahlawat told the court that the video of this CD is in everyone's mobile today
 jabaki police kah rahi he ki unke paas video nahin he
 If the police had a CD, would they have leaked themselves? Advocate Nitin Ahlawat told the duty magistrate that the CD should be forensic examined
 sidi kii jaanch main yah sach baahar aayega ki kya aarope lagane vaali mahila vahiin he
 Also, Sandeep weighs about 150 kg and the person seen in the video does not seem to be 150 kg at all
 nitin ne court ko bataaya ki aarope lagane vaali mahila kaa ek 30 saal kaa vivaahit ladkaa he
 Nitin told the duty magistrate that it was a conspiracy to implicate Sandeep Kumar
 unhen pataa he ki sandip par lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe hai, isliye unhone abhi tak sandip kii jamaanat kii maang nahin kii
 He also opposes the demand for 14 days police custody
 sandip kumaar ke vakil kaa 14 dinon kipulice castadika virodh karte hi dilli police ne duty magistrate ko peedit mahila ke darj bayaan kaa hawala diya
 Police said, the woman has alleged in the recorded statement that as a minister, Sandeep Kumar has exploited many women

 2
 apane liye vakt nikaalane kii jarurat nahinhar insaan kaa sabase majboot rishta khud se hota he
 In such a situation, it is very important to have time for yourself
 single hone kaa ye sabase bada phayda he ki aapako apane liye vakt nikaalane kii jarurat nahin he
 Your time is only for you
 jise aap khud ko behatar se behatar banane main laga sakati hai
 3
 dusron ko samajhane kaa vaktakai baar sahi insaan kii talash karne ke dauraan aapkaa saamana bure logon se bhi hoga
 You have time and you can use this time to test people
 is dauraan aap ye bhi samaj paaengi kiapako apane partner main kya chahieor kya nahin chahie
 4
 puraane sambandhon par rone se behatar he, single honaakai baar aisa hota he ki aap jiske saath jindagi bitaane ke sapane sajaate hai wo adhure hi rah jate hai
 Or sometimes it happens that relationships end with a lot of bitterness
 aise main behatar he ki aap negative rishton kaa boj uthaane se bachein

 Whatever you want to do, you can do it the way you want to decorate your career
 single hone kii vajah se aapkaa puraa focus apane kaam par hota he or aap apana best de sakati hai
 6
 travelsingle hone ke sabase bade phaaydon main se ek yah he ki aap jahaan chahen apni marji se gum sakati hai
 It gets a little tough if you are with someone
 jaruri nahin ki aap jahaan ghoomane janaa chaahati hanapaka partner bhi vahiin janaa chaahe
 Or he is also discharged when you are on leave
 aise main to single hokar aap apni marji se kahin bhi aa-ja sakati hai
 7
 aap apane pishan ko pahchaan sakati hamrishte main bandhane ke baad aapaki praathamiktaayen badal jaati hai or aapkaa apana pishan kahin kisi kone main dafan ho jaataa he
 If you want to do something that is truly out of the box, then it may never get a good chance
 8
 You will not feel yourself trapped once it becomes very difficult to get out of it
 bhale hi aap us rishte se khush na hon phir bhi use nibhaane ke liye majaboor ho jaati hai
 Due to emotional attachment, you cannot even think of separating and feel yourself in bondage
 aisi sthiti se to behatar he ki aap single hi rahen

 He has directed most of my shots
 kangana ke liye mere dil main kaaphi sammaan he
 i feel that i have become Jhalkari Bai and i am trying to guard my queen Lakshmibai
 unhone apane aapako sabit kiya he

 rajdhani sthit desh ke sabase bade aspataal ames (ol india institute of medical sciensej) main bandaron kaa aatank jagajaahir he
 Within AIIMS, it is not just the doctors or patients who are troubled by monkeys
 resident doctors ke liye banaae gaye apartment ke aasapaas kai dukaanon main bandaron kaa khauf he
 Irshad, who has been stitching white coats from junior to senior doctors, has been working as a tailor within AIIMS for the past 1 year
 irshaad bandaron ke aatank se behad ghabaraae hue hai
 Irshad said that monkeys suddenly come on the roof of the shop and the nearby shed
 bandar chat par kudate hue un logon par atake karte hai jo haath main fruit yaa zeus lekar nikal rahe hote hai
 People get scared after seeing the monkey and the monkey also pans by seeing food and drink
 ames prashasan kii badi laaparvaahee ai samenesutron ke mutabik ames prashasan kii taraf se bandaron or kutton ko pakadaney ke liye handlers niyukt gaye the jiskaa tender disambar 2016 main khatm ho gaya tha
 Currently, after the news of the terror of monkeys and dogs for the last several days, the file has been sent again to the director
 nai file main handlers kii sankhya badhaane kaa prapojal bhi rakhaa gaya he
 Aaj Tak spoke to Dr
 Amit in AIIMS administration on the terror of monkeys and the negligence of not appointing handlers
 dow amit kaa kahana he ki bandar or kutton kii samasya naa sirfems campasbalki puri dilli main he
 Earlier, AIIMS appointed handlers of monkeys and dogs whom the AIIMS administration would reappoint
 isse pehle bhi aawaara kutton ko agency pakadakar le ja chuki he
 But the reason for their growth is also that daily AIIMS gets very crowded
 marij or parijan jo khaanaa lekar aate hai uskaa bachaa hua hissaa kutton or bandar ko miltaa he
 He further said that it is not just a problem of not having handlers
 aapke channel ke madhyam se aspataal aane vaale logon se apil he ki radimaid khaane se bandar aakarshith hote hai phir wo apana ghar bana lete hai
 Also, the agency will have to pay attention to this

 At present, there are 8 handlers for the campus which have also been proposed to be increased to 12
 lekin sirf handlers se kaam nahin chalegaa, janata ko bhi sahyog karnaa hoga
 Dr
 Amit said that through the doctors and security guards of the hospital, they often get information about the terror of monkeys
 ames prashasanne aashwaasan diya he ki shikaayat aane ke baad bandaron ko hataane kii puri koshish kii ja rahi he
 Doctors believe that if the monkey or dog bites or injures it should not be ignored at all
 ames ke export dow veda prakaash ne bataaya ki-1
 If any animal is bitten by the foreskin and blood is coming out, then the injury should be considered very serious
 bandar yaa kute kaa saliva agar aapke khun se mil jaae to sabase khatarnaak virus rebies aapke sharir main pahunch saktaa he
 It becomes very difficult to treat it
 bandar yaa kute ke kaatane ke baad agar chot ko nazarandaaj kiya to us ang ke hisse main infections ho saktaa he yaa us hisse ko katkar hataanaa bhi pad saktaa he
 2
 bandar yaa kutta kaat de toturant doctor ke paas jaaen yaa ghar par sabun or pani se acchhee tarah saaf karen taaki saliva zyada se zyada hat sake
 Earlier it used to take 14 injections, now 5 injections are used
 5 injection kaa course karnaa behad jaruri he ise nazarandaaj nahin karnaa chahie

 mahilaon ko jismfaroshi ke daldal se baahar laakar jibi road ke avaidh dhandhe ko band karaane ke liye muhim chalaa rahi hai
 He told that till now in his investigation, it has come to light that every day there is a body trade of Rs 5 crore on GB Road
 iske peeche kai rasukhdaar log hai, jo ab unhen alag-alag tareeke se sanket de rahe hai ki wo apni muhim band kar den, iske liye unhen jhuthe mukademon main fansaaya ja rahaa he or unhen ashanka he ki jaldi hi police unhengiraftarkar legi

 alabatta unhone kaha ki unke paas koi pukhta saboot philhal nahin he or ye aarope unhone mil rahe sanketon ke aadhaar par lagaaya he

 According to Swati Maliwal, she has some so-called well-wishers, who come and tell them that they should not interfere in the matter of GB Road and let what is happening there be allowed to run like that
 haalanki unhone aise logon ke khilaaf koi aupchaarik shikaayat darj nahin karai he

 Congress is going to shift its headquarters in Gujarat this week
 iske liye achche muhoort ke liye janmashtami kaa din bhi tay kiya gaya he
 The special thing is that special care has been taken to keep the new office good according to Vastu
 gujarat congress ke sachiv bhavin vyas ne bataaya ki purana karyaalay vaastushastra ke hisaab se shubh nahin lag rahaa tha
 The new office has been specially designed keeping in mind Vastu
 puraane karyaalay main pradesh adhyaksh kaa karyaalay dakshin disha kii ore munh vaala tha, jabaki nae karyaalay main ye dhyaan rakhaa gaya he ki purv or pashchim disha main ye karyaalay ho jo ki vaastu kii drushti se zyada shubh mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress hopes that now its fate will change in Gujarat
 purana karyaalay jise rajeev gandhi bhawan naam diya gaya tha vah 1987 main bana tha or uske baad se hue rajya ke tamaam chunaav congress harati rahi he
 That is why the Congress had started feeling that something was wrong with Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan itself
 ab nae karyaalay main jane kii jaldbaaji bhi isaliye he ki janmashtami acha muhoort he or rajya main chah mahanagarapalika or anya sthaneey chunaav oktober main hone hai
 The comments bhaajapa congress ke is kadam kaa makhul uda rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Jagdish Bhavsar says that now the Congress is unable to connect with the people, so now it is resorting to luck, but the Congress will not be able to stand again in Gujarat
 is bich congress ko iskaa phayda hota he yaa nahin ye to aane vaale chunaavon main hi pataa chal paaegaa, lekin duusare tathy yah hai ki congress shaayad vaastushastra ke mutabik, apane karyaalay ko sahi kar le, lekin party netritv main jo bade paimaane par khemebaazi he use khatm karne ke liye koi thos kadam nahin uthaaye ja rahe hai
 So far Congress has been seen in the dark on important issues
 patidaar aarakshan kaa mudda rajya main bahut samay se garmaya hua he, lekin ab tak congress ne is par apana rukh saaf nahin kiya he or ab bhi asamanjas main he
 Bhavin Vyas, secretary of the Gujarat Congress, said that the old office was not looking good according to Vastushastra
 nae karyaalay ko vishesh taur par vaastu ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya he
 In the old office, the office of the state president was facing towards the south, while in the new office it has been kept in mind that this office should be in the east and west direction, which is considered more auspicious from the point of view of Vastu
 aise main congress ko umid he ki ab uskaa bhagya gujarat main badalegaa
 The old office, named Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan, was built in 1987 and the Congress has been losing all elections in the state since then
 isiilie congress ko pichley kuch samay se lagane laga tha ki rajeev gandhi bhawan main hi kuch gadabad he
 Now it is too early to go to the new office because Janmashtami is a good time and six municipal corporations and other local elections are to be held in the state in October
 tippaniyan The BJP is mocking this move of the Congress
 bhaajapa pravaktaa jagadish bhavsaar kehete hai ki ab congress logon se jud nahin paa rahi he isaliye ab bhagya kaa sahaara le rahi he, lekin gujarat main phir bhi congress dobaaraa khadi nahin ho paaegi
 In the meantime, whether the Congress benefits or not, it will be known only in the coming elections, but other facts are that the Congress may, according to Vastu Shastra, correct its office, but in the party leadership which is a big camp
 No concrete steps are being taken to eliminate it
 mahatvapurn muddon par ab tak congress andhere main nazar aa rahi he
 The issue of Patidar reservation has been hot in the state for a long time, but till now the Congress has not made its stand clear on this and is still confused

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Rinku Singh Rahi, a PCS officer who has voiced against the scam in up's Social Welfare Department, has been on a fast unto death in Aligarh
 raahi ke mutabik ghotaale par pardaa daalane ke liye unhen artiai ke tahat jaankaree bhi nahin di ja rahi
 Till the time information is available, Rahi has announced to continue the fast
 chaahe unhen jail bhi kyon na bhej diya jaae? According to Rahi, they are not being given information under RTI to cover the scam
 jab tak jaankaree nahin milegi tab tak raahi ne anshan jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 Even if they are sent to jail? antardhyaan yaa phir vigyaan? sach kya he? ye sawaal isliye, kyonki inhen donon ke bich jalandhar keashutosh maharaj kii jindagi or mautki paheli pichley das maheene se uljhi hui he
 Doctors are saying that Maharaj has died according to medical science
 unke sharir ke tamaam angon ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 But the directors of Maharaj's ashram say that Maharaj is intransigent
 unhone samadhi le lee he
 But now the Punjab and Haryana High Court, giving its verdict in this case, ordered the funeral of Maharaj to be performed within 15 days
 jalandhar ke santashutosh maharajako apni ankhen khole or apni jubaan se ek bhi lafz kahe hue das maheene se bhi zyaada guzar gaye
 But there is a market of discussions about Maharaj that even after his silence, he remains constantly hot
 charchaa ye ki maharaj jinda hai, unki maut ho chuki he
 Or he himself has gone to the tomb of his own free will
 darasal 29 janvari 2014 ke baad se maharaj ke jism main koi bhi harakat nahin hui
 Just like what usually happens after the death of a human being, and even the doctors have called Maharaj clinically dead
 lekin bhakt hai ki is baat ko maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin
 Rather they say that Maharaj is in samadhi and hence his last rites cannot be performed
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki sirf isi ek tark kii binah par medical science kii nigahon main murda ashutosh maharaj kii laash pichley das maheene se bhi zyada vakt se jalandhar ke nazadik unke ashram yani divya jyoti jagriti santhaan main ek freezer main jas kii tas rakhi he
 It is another matter that after January 29, the color of his body has also changed
 haalanki ab punjab and haryana hai court ne maharaj kaa antim sanskaar karne ke nirdesh die hai or sarkaar se kaha he ki wo iske liye ek hai-level kii cameti bana kar agle 15 dinon main unka antim sanskaar kar de
 The special thing is that no one, but his son Dilip Kumar Jha had applied for the funeral of Maharaj in the High Court and said that he should be given the right of funeral of his father
 lekin lakh take kaa sawaal ye he ki aakhir maut or samadhi ke chakkar main uljhe ashutosh ji maharaj kaa sach kya he? unhen lekar koun sach bol rahaa he or koun jhooth, ye samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Because science says that clinically dead means death, but here is not ready to follow spiritual science
 maharaj ke shagird hai ki kah rahe hai ki wo samadhi main leen ho gaye hai or samadhi main leen hone vaale yogi apni shaktiyon kii badaulat apane dil kii dhadkan or nabj par kaabo kar sakate hai
 The argument also is that while yogis and saints in the Himalayas can do austerities in the cold below zero degrees, why can't Maharaj do it inside the freezer? However, there is another big screw in this story
 khud maharaj ke driver kii maane, to ye sab darasal maharaj ke peeche unki gaddi or jaaydaad ko lekar jari rassakashi kaa nateeja he
 But there are some questions between death and this trance of samadhi which have been prevalent for the last ten months
 sawaal ye ki kya in sabake peeche unke uttaradhikaar or sampatti kii ladaai hi iklauti vajah he?dekha jaae, to ashutosh maharaj par aae hai court ke is faisle ke baad in sawaalon kaa jawaab apane-aap saaf ho chukaa he
 Because in the eyes of the court too, Maharaj has died now
 lekin jis tarah se bhakton ke virodh ke bich unke antim sanskaar ke liye court ne ek cameti bana kar 15 dinon kaa vakt mukarrar kiya he
 It is clear from him that this matter of his funeral is not so easy

 Thanks to Chandrakant Prasad Singh's blog u & ME) punjab neshnal bank main 12400 karod rupee se zyada kaa ghotaalaa saamne aane ke baad bhartiya rigerv bank ne bada ection liya he
 RBI has scrapped the facility of issuing letter of intent to banks
 iske saath hi kendriya bank ne letters of confort (loc) ko bhi khatm kar diya he
 Both these instruments were used by banks to guarantee their customers
 iskaa sabase zyada asar hira or jewelery kaa bade str par aayaat karne vaale kaarobaariyon par padegaa
 Experts say that even though lou and loc have little involvement in credit giving
 isse kaarobaariyon ko zyada nuksaan to nahin jhelana padegaa, lekin isse unka kaarobaar jarur prabhavit hoga
 After the PNB scam, the way for businessmen to get a guarantee has become very difficult
 aise samay main lou par laga pratibandh mushkil khadi kar saktaa he
 The action on behalf of the central bank was taken after the Punjab National Bank scam
 is faisle ke jariye arabiai banking vyavastha main saamne aa rahi khaamiyon ko dur karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Once the lou and loc systems are scrapped, traders can continue to provide bank letters of credit and guarantees
 yah vyavastha sucharu rup se chalati rahegi
 This arrangement is in accordance with international standards
 ye vyavastha credit jari karne vaale kaa paksh majboot karata he
 In fact, whenever a bank issues guarantees and locs to pay money to a businessman, the receiving bank also checks at its level under this arrangement
 is vyavastha main guarantee risive karne vaala bank apane str par yah dekhtaa he ki jise vah paise dene vaala he, uski credit history kitni majboot or kamjor he
 This significantly reduces the responsibility of the bank issuing the loc
 vahiin, lou or letters of confort kii baat karen, to isamen karj dene vaale bank inhen jari karne vaale bank kii guarantee ke aadhaar par hi paisa de dete hai
 In this he does not conduct any kind of investigation at his level
 kyonki lou main ek tarah se ise jari karne vaala bank guarantee detaa he ki graahak ke difolt hone par vah bhugtan kar degaa
 Bankers say that the collator of credit is more secure
 kyonki is par ayatak kii jaankaree, jari karne kii taarikh, expyri date or jis saamaan ko kharidne ke liye yah liya ja rahaa he, uski jaankaree bhi hoti he
 This does not happen in the case of but lou
 is vajah se inamen gadabadi kaa pataa lagaana kaaphi zyada mushkil ho jaataa he
 What is lou? Letter of Undertaking (lou) is a kind of bank guarantee

 Fearing the Taliban, the buses removed audio video sets from the buses
 uttar pashchim pakistan ke apane dabadabe vaale ilaake main pichley dinon taliban ne jari kar diya bason se audio-video set hataane kaa farmaan
 The Taliban had threatened fidayeen attacks on vehicles in which they were found playing or filming

 Pious people get mental pain from this
 ab uttar pashchim pakistan main kiski majaal jo taliban ke aage sir uthaa le kyonki yahaan ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main patta bhi khadkata he to taliban ke ishaare par
 The order of the Taliban was to come when the buses started removing audio-video sets from their vehicles
 ab tak ilaake ke zyaadaatar bas maalik apni bason se sterio or video plator hataa chuke hai
 Actually, issuing such orders to show their dominance is one of the Taliban's spirit

 What is the matter? In many blocks of the state, in the name of allotting cows to BPL families, an open game was played by District Department of Development and Brokers
 beete saal krishi, pashupaalan evam sahakaarita vibhaag kii ore se 90 pratishat anudaan par bipiel pariwaron ko do dudharu gaay vitaran kii yojana shuru kii gayi thi
 Under the scheme, fairs were organized at the district and state level for the purchase of milch cows, but the prose officials, in connivance with the animal vendors, distributed them among the villagers after the purchase of cows at the fair without issuing health check and health proof
 vaise kisaanon ko vitaran ke samay gaayon dwaara 10 se 20 kilo doodh dene kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin gaayen sirf do se teen kilo doodh hi de rahi hai
 It is alleged that in this entire game lakhs of haters were made

 pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj upi ke sant kabir nagar ke magahar se apane chunavi abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kar rahe hai
 Kabir is considered to be the messiah of Dalits, backward, exploited, communal harmony and social unity
 maujuuda samay main yahi samaaj bijepi se naaraaz dikh rahaa he, jiske jariye basapa or sapa milakar modi ko maat dene kii jugat main he
 In such a situation, Modi is knocking at the rate of Sant Kabir, it is being seen as an exercise to balance 2
5 crore Kabirists along with the balance of caste
 bataa den ki solahavin sadi ke mahansant kabirdaska janm varanasi main muslim julaha (bunakar) samaaj main hua tha
 He spent almost his entire life in Kashi, but at last he came to Maghar
 magahar vahi jagah he, jahaan tamaam saamaajik manyataon or rudhivadita ko todate hue sant kabir ne 1518 i
 i breathed my last
 upi ke loksabhaa upachunaavon main akhilesh or mayawati ke saath aate hi bijepi ko shikast khaani padi
 Not only this, the caste equation of BJP is also disturbed
 aise main bijepi phir ek baar apane soshal ejineering formule ko majboot karne kii kavayad main jute gai he
 Recently, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath questioned the lack of reservation for Dalits in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia University and said that no party speaks on reservation of Dalits in these two universities
 sant kabir das 620 prakatya diwasapar unke darshan ko najadik se jaanane-samajhane ke liye unke anuyaayi nepal, purvottar ke sikkim se lekar uttar bharat ke punjab, haryana, rajasthan, pashchimi praant gujarat, dilli, jammu, chhattisgarh, or madhya pradesh sahit anya rajyon se magahar pahunche hai
 Kabirpantis include the most Dalit and backward communities
 aise main piem modi magahar main kabir ke dar par aae anuyaayiyon ko sambodhit karenge
 It is believed that through this, Modi is in the process of helping the Kabirists
 vahiin musalamaanon main badi aabaadi kabir ko maanane vaali hai khaskar julaha samaaj ko bhi kahin na apane paale main laane kii koshish he
 The influence of Ramkabir Pant in Gujarat, Sant Kabir has followers all over the country
 lekin gujarat ke gramin kshetra main raamakabir panth kaa khaasaa prabhaav he
 It is believed that at least one family in every village of Gujarat is connected with the Kabir Panth
 piem modi bhi gujarat se hai or gramin ilaake se he
 He has been speaking on several occasions through Kabir's couplets
 aise main modi kabirpanthiyon ke bich kabir kii vichaardhaara ko rakhenge
 States that have assembly elections this year
 unamem bhi kabir ke anuyaayi kaaphi taadaad main he
 There are many branches and sub-branches of Kabir Panth in Chhattisgarh
 rajasthan ke nagaur main , patna main fatuha math, biddoopur math, bhagatahi shakha, chhattisgadhi yaa dharmadasi shakha, harkesar math, lakshmipur math jaise kai mathon, sansthaaon par kabir panth ke anuyaayi hai

 gujarat ke bhavnagar main bheeshan haadasa ho gaya he
 a truck full of 60 people rushed into the drain, killing 26 people present
 ye haadasa rajkot hive par palitana ke paas hua he
 This truck was carrying a procession that this accident happened on the way
 bhavnagar ke tatam gaanv ke rahane vaale vijay kii shaadi thi or jab baraat ghar se nikali ko duulhe vijay ko chhodkar sabhi baaraati trek main savaar hue
 Vijay got out of the car for his wedding
 raste main baratiyon se bhare trek kaa accident ho gaya
 The truck fell into the drain and 26 people died
 haalanki duulhaa apni car se sahi salaamat pahunch gaya
 Both Vijay's parents died in this accident
 haadase kii khabar logon ko mili lekin unhone isaki jaankaree vijay ko nahin di
 People present there got Vijay married in a hurry
 haadase main kai log jakhmi hai
 All the injured were taken to the government hospital at Sinhor and Tindor in Bhavnagar for treatment
 haadase ke baad sarkaar ne rescue ke liye kai tiimon ko lagaaya he
 State Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has announced a compensation of Rs 4-4 lakh to the families of those killed
 siemo ne bhi haadase kii jaankaree lee
 The police are involved in the investigation of the matter
 mujffarnagar raahat shiviron main rah rahe peediton ke dukhon ko andekha kar saifai main filmi sitaron sang jashn manaane vaale mulaayam singh yadav ko garibon kii yaad ai he
 Mulayam wants at least one gas stove in the house of every poor to be free
 iske liye unki samaajawaadee sarkaar khud to kuch nahin kar rahi par wo centre sarkaar ko suzav jarur de rahe hai
 SP supremo says what will happen to 12 subsidized LPG cylinders instead of nine? Must have at least 24
 iske saath garibon ko to muft main bhi silendar dena chahie
 In fact, today in Lucknow, Mulayam Singh Yadav was holding a meeting of his party workers
 iske baad press conference main jab unase upie sarkaar ke sabsidi vaale gas silendar kii sankhya nau se baarah karne ke faisle ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone do took andaaj main kaha, 'ye koun si badi baat he
 Twenty four should not be twelve
 muft karnaa chahie, 'garibon ko hameshaa karnaa chahie
 i have always said that from where will the poor take the gas cylinder now
 garib hai, unako muft den, baarah den yaa chaudaa den lekin garibon ko muft den
 The reason for Mulayam's generosity is only one, that is election
 loksabhaa chunaav najadik hai, kahin congress sabsidi vaale silendaron kii sankhya badhaakar vot na bator le jaae aise main garibon ko muft silendar kii maang mahaj ek or siyaasi bol najar aata he
 By the way, if Mulayam wishes, he can fulfill his demand from his son Akhilesh Yadav's government too
 kyonki sabsidi dene kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaar ke paas bhi he
 If she wants, she can help the economically weaker sections, as did the Sheila Dixit government of Delhi

 Asked whether Australia was being named as the title contender for the ICC Cricket World Cup starting on February 19, Ponting said he did not care
 ponting ne shuukravaar ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "isse kuch fark nahin padataa ki ham vishwa cap main pasandida team hai yaa nahin
 It is completely irrelevant
 haa, ham ekadivasiy cricket main sheersh par hai lekin ham is bare main nahin soch rahe hai
 "ponting also does not agree with the prediction that India and South Africa are strong contenders for the World Cup title
 unhone kaha, "main aashwast nahin hum ki is tarah ke toornament main pansadeeda or gaiyr pasandida kaa koi matlab hota he
 The teams of India and South Africa are excellent

 This Friday is released 'ABCD 2' which is a sequel to the 2013 ABCD
 ise diarect kiya he, remo disuza ne, jinke ishaaron par naachte nazar aaenge varun dhawan, shraddha kapur
 Prabhu Deva is in the guest role, remoing himself with judge and Terence Lewis with him
 film dance par aadhaarit he ye aapako bhi pataa he
 It is difficult to tell more than this
 baat khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 The biggest drawback of this film is its weak story, in which you will not see any newness and perhaps that is why i had a little difficulty in understanding the direction of director Remo
 wo kahani ko ghisi-pity hui shuruyaat to dete hai or isse pehle ki vah film ke liye ghaatak ho jaae foran isse baahar bhi nikal aate hai par sawaal he aisa karne kii unhen kya zarurat thi, kyonki iske kaaran film kaa majaa kharaab hota he
 However, it is also true that in such films there is not much space for the story
 baat film kii lambaai kii karen to film lambii he par aapako khalegi nahin, haa par kuch seens kaate ja sakate the, jiskaa film par iskaa koi khaas asar nahin padataa
 Talking about the merits, 'ABCD 2' is the only film in Hindi cinema, which is completely dedicated to dance
 diarector ne bhale hi film kii script par zyada jor nahin diya ho par vah apni film main dance ko antarrashtriya str par le gaye hai
 The comments dance ke dauraan varun kii urja or shraddha kii purnataa yani parafection kamaal kii he
 His hard work is clearly visible on the screen
 vahiin prabhu deva kaa dance or unke varun ke saath kiye gaye dance steps aapke chehre par muskaan bikherenge
 The cinematography and the great music, the lyrics are awesome
 tarif yahaan nirdeshak remo disuja kii kerani jaruri he, jinhone badi khubsuurati se ganesh stuti or deshbhakti geet par hip hop style main dance compos kiya he
 The production quality of this film is grand compared to the first ABCD
 agar aapako dance pasand he to film jarur dekhen
 Yes, but do not expect comedy or hard story from the film
 meri ore se film ko 3
 5 stars is film kii sabase badi khami he, isaki kamjor kahani, jisamen aapako bilkul nayaapan nahin dikhegaa or shaayad isliye mujhe nirdeshak remo kaa nirdesan samajhane main zaraa dikkat pesh ai
 He gives the story a shaky start and immediately comes out of it before it becomes fatal for the film, but the question is what did he need to do, because it spoils the fun of the film
 haalanki ye baat bhi sahi he ki aisi filmon main kahani ke liye zyada jagah nahin hoti
 Talking about the length of the film, the film is long but will not eat you, yes some scenes could be cut, which does not have any special effect on the film
 baat khoobiyon kii karen to 'ABCD 2' hindi cinema kii iklauti film he, jo puri tarah dance ko samarpit he
 The director may not have given much emphasis on the script of the film but he has taken the dance internationally in his film
 tippaniyan The perfection of Varun's energy and reverence during the dance is amazing
 inaki mehnat parde par saaf najar aati he
 At the same time, the dance of Prabhu Deva and the dance steps done with his Varun will make you smile
 dance ko khubsuurati se ubhaarne vaali cinemetographi or umdaa sangeet, gane kamaal hai
 Compliments are needed here by director Remo d'souza, who has beautifully composed dance in hip hop style on Ganesh Praise and patriotic song
 is film kii production quality pehali ABCD ke muqaabale bhavy he
 If you like dance, then definitely watch the film
 haa, par film se kamedi yaa pakki kahani kii ummid mat rakhiegaa

 com / o8zye8phlj Samsung ne haal hi bharat main Galaxy Watch Active ko launch kiya he
 It has been priced at Rs 19,999
 ye smart watch fitness centric he or isamen fitness se jude kai fitures die gaye hai
 Let us tell you that Samsung rebranded the Galaxy Wear to the Galaxy Watch and in February this year was introduced with the Galaxy S10
 Galaxy Watch Active main aapako Galaxy Watch kii tarah rotating bejals nahin milte hai or na hi ye overol sies main Galaxy Watch jaisi he
 It is much better if you look and feel
 sabase pehali baat aap notice karenge or ye he ki yah lite wet he
 You will not always feel like wearing a watch
 iske peeche company kaa logic ye he ki ise pahan kar so sakate hai or sleep trekking feechar se apni fitness ko behatar tareeke se trek kar sakate hai
 Design The display of the Galaxy Watch Active is circular, the look is premium and hard plastic is used, which looks premium
 rotating bejal nahin he jo isaki sabase badi kami kahi ja sakati he
 Because the feature of Samsung's smart watch has been the rotating bezel
 is watch ke saath rabar kaa strap diya gaya he, lekin acchhee baat ye he ki ise aap kisi bhi ghadi kii shop par change kara sakate hai
 However, the rubber strap provided is comfortable to wear
 ghadi kaa sies thodaa chota he or is vajah se iskaa luk Galaxy Watch Active kii tarah muscular nahin he
 Since this is fitness centric, it can also be justified
 is smart watch kii dayee taraf do physical batan die gaye hai

 aaj tak tech reating – 8 / 10 Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott criticized the Indian team's batting performance as "inexperienced, irresponsible and near stupid"

 The batting was so inexperienced and irresponsible that it was close to stupid
 outswing hoti gendon par drive khilne kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 The England coach defended the practice of Team India in the context of the manner of dismissal of Gavaskar opener Murali Vijay
 Boycott believes that the Indian batsmen did not show passion while flicking the outswinger
 unhone kaha, ‘sidhi outswing gend ko midwicket par khilne kii koshish karnaa or iske baad bold hone yaa balle kaa kinaaraa lagane par hairaan hona bevakoofana he
 The ball should not be played in front of your pad
 ’bycott kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya ballebaajon ke out hone ke tareeke se pataa chalata he ki unhone sahi taiyaari nahin kii
 He said, 'these are small things, which you should not do against a swing bowler right in the circumstances of England
 aisi chijen james anderson ke khilaaf karne kii koshish karnaa, jo in halaat main diggajon main se ek he, bataata he ki bhartiya ballebaajon ne sahi taiyaari nahin kii he
 'good news for Team India, bumrah-ashwin fit, Virat Kohli, who has scored more than eight thousand runs in the innermost Test cricket, has called Indians a lion of almost flat wickets
 unhone kaha, ‘in ladakon ko bharat main sapaat, sookhe, kam oochaal vaali pichon par ballebaaji or aasaan ran banane kii aadat he
 The new ball does not do much and you can play a lot of straight shots
 ’bycott ne kaha, ‘bharat atmamugdhata kaa shikaar hokar england aayaa
 He was thinking arrogantly that he would be able to bat this way and everything would be fine

 The Indian scientist says that the so-called black holes are not actually black holes, but flames of fire like our Sun, and recently NASA scientists have discovered huge flames of x rays from a black hole

 In this way, in Einstein's theory, what is called a black hole, we can call it a very hot fireball or 'magnetospheric eternally collapsing objects' (MECO) formed by the constriction of a giant star

 aise main yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki yadi blike hole se kuch bhi baahar nahin aa saktaa to corona kaise baahar aayaa? a few days ago, the president of theoretical astronomy at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Mumbai, and now Assistant Professor at Homi Bhabha National Institute, Abhaas Mitra says that this new discovery from NASA only confirms his theory that in the universe No 'real' black hole exists and what we call as black holes, those astro bodies are actually magnetic plas Ma's terribly hot shells
