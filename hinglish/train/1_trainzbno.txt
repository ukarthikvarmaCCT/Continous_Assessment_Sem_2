 mobile tower radiation ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye bhale hi centre sarkaar ne nae niyam bana die hon, lekin dilli main khatre kii ashanka isliye bhi adhik he kyonki yahaan kareeb 50 fisadi tower gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se lage hue hai
 It is a matter of concern that neither permission is required to apply them nor the guidelines have been followed while planting them
 mobile tower ke liye nae niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad saaf ho gaya he ki ye khatre ke tower hai
 Even though the damage from electromagnetic radiation emanating from the tower has not been confirmed, the government has framed new rules and believes that radiation is dangerous
 lekin dilli main to khatra or bhi bada he, kyonki rajdhani main lage kareeb aadhe mobile tower gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se laga die gaye hai
 Yogendra Chandolia, Chairman of the Standing Committee of North MCD, said, "according to our records, half the towers in Delhi are illegal, because the essential things which are required before installing the tower, which MCD gives permission to see
 hamane karrwai kii he, to ye log court chale gaye, ab ham ection nahin le sakate hai, lekin aadhe tower gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se lage hai
 According to the MCD report, there are a total of 5656 mobile towers in Delhi, out of which mobile companies have legally obtained MCD permission for only 3000 mobile towers
 2656 mobile tower ab bhi aise hai, jo zaruri guideline ko taak par rakhkar lagaae gaye hai or emsidi ne isaki ijaajat nahin di
 This matter is currently in the Delhi High Court
 lekin is bich radiation kam karne kii kavayad ke bich dilli main ek baar phir gaiyrkanoonee mobile toweron se khatre kii ashanka paidaa ho gai he
 There is always a possibility of danger from radiation emanating from the mobile tower
 saath hi betaratib tareeke se lagaae gaye mobile toweron ne is khatre ko kai guna or badhaa diya he
 Now new rules to reduce radiation have been made, but the question is to strictly follow these rules
 dilli main lage mobile tower na sirf skulon or aspataalon ke aasapaas hai, balki rihaayshi ilaakon main makaanon ke ekadam paas lage hai, isse na sirf khatre kii ashanka bani rahegi, balki nae niyam bhi beasar hi sabit honge
 Everyone will agree more than this that if your friendship is with your boss in the office, the furnace of rumors will always be hot
 ho saktaa he ki aapke or bos ke bich ek swasth sambandh ho iske baavjood log kaanaafoosee karnaa nahin chodengen
 In such a situation, we suggest you how you can take everything in your favor
 
 
 log kya sochenge?yah hamaare samaaj kii hi dikkat he or daftar apwaad nahin hai
 If your boss is your best friend, then everyone will have their own perspective, and if they are opposite sex, then people will not know what things will follow you
 kuch bhi sikret nahin rahegaa
 
 
 It happens many times that all the things come out from our mouths in front of the boss, which is not good to speak in public
 aise main aap satark rahen or aisi baton se bilkul hi bachein jo aapako aage dikkaton main daal den
 It is a matter of business, not personal
 
 
 ho saktaa he ki nijee taur par aapkaa dost sari baton ke liye aapako na daante, magar profeshnal taur par aapako behad satark rahane kii jarurat padegi
 After all, in the end, the whole matter is limited to the economy itself? 
 
 agar aapke kaam or uske rigelt ke bich main aapkaa bos aa rahaa he to aapako apane kaam ko lekar behad satark hone kii jarurat he
 It is not the case that all work and relations are mixed together
 weekend ke sawaal par
 
 
 It often happens that when your friend is your boss, new faces are not seen even on weekends
 saptaah ke or dinon main bhi saath-saath hona or weekend par bhi unke saath hone ke phaayde se adhik nuksaan hi hai
 If your friend only becomes your boss
 
 
 aisa kai baar hota he hamaare saath kaam karne vaala koi sahakarmi jo hamaara dost bhi hota he
 One day we get promoted and become our boss
 aise main khud kii raftaar or sambandhon main thodi spashtataa lani padati he

 He will go on to score 14 Grand Slam titles from Pete Sampras of the United States and, if successful, will reach a joint second place in the list of winners of the most Grand Slam titles after Federer

 a regional passport office Mumbai has issued a show cause notice to Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar asking why her passport should be confiscated for hiding the cases going against her, but Medha feels that behind this notice There is a deep intrigue
 bhopal main enditivi se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki yah bahut gahari sajeesh he, jiskaa pataa lagane kii jarurat he
 Already with some business groups, some government representatives are against us, it is common in the country today to discredit mass agitators, put them in jail
 sahi muddon se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye ye saazish kii gai he
 She also said that she has already responded to the notice of Mumbai RPO on October 18, 2019, sharing her written reply in which she said that she had already shown cases in Barwani, Alirajpur and Khandwa districts of Madhya Pradesh
 Three of them (two in Barwani and one in Alirajpur) have been acquitted
 sardaar sarovar ke visthapiton ke liye ek maun juluus nikaalane se sambandhit ek or maamla agast 2017 main badvani main darj kiya gaya tha, isliye vahaan march 2017 main ise passport karyaalay ko suchit karne ke bare main koi prashn nahin uthta
 As far as the pending cases in the Khandwa District Court are concerned, i do not remember whether summons or arrests have been made in any of these cases nor do i remember that the accused have been made in these cases so far
 medha patkar ke netritv main bhopal main sardaar sarovar ke visthapit behatar purnvas or duusari maaghon ko lekar bhopal main narmada ghati vikaas praadhikaran (envidie) karyaalay ke baahar chathe din bhi satyagrah par baithe rahe
 The notice has again been sent by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rebel mlas Colonel Devendra Singh Sehrawat and Anil Vajpayee to join BJP, Ram Niwas Goel, speaker of Delhi Assembly
 spikar ram nivas goyal aam aadmi party ke donon baagi vidhayakon ko 3 july tak jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he or 4 july ko pesh hone ko kaha he
 Actually, Speaker of Delhi Legislative Assembly Ram Niwas Goyal has sent notice to both rebel mlas under the Dal Balaul Act, because both the mlas have now joined BJP
 isse pehle bijwasan se baagi vidhayak karnal devendra singh saharaavat ne pehle notice ke khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha, jisko lekar supreme court main unhen jhatka laga or court ne is maamle dakhal dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 AAP rebel MLA from Gandhinagar, Anil Bajpai said that it is up to the Aam Aadmi Party and Speaker Ram Niwas Goel to prove whether i have joined the BJP or not
 kyonki dal badal kanoon ke mutabik mujhe pehle party kii taraf se party kaa adhyaksh notice bhejtaa joki nahin bheja gaya
 Anil Vajpayee said that Arvind Kejriwal was the president of AAP till 2017, after that his tenure was not extended, whereas the notice i received was sent by AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj which is not valid and the party president notice under the Dal Balaam Act Sends not a spokesperson
 doosraa mere upar offis profit kaa bhi maamla chal rahaa he
 Then in that case i am the MLA or not, the court will decide because the matter is going on in the court
 unhone kaha ki teesraa main bijepi main shaamil hua ki nahin, takneekee rup se aam aadmi party or spikar ko sabit karnaa he, jabaki niyam ke tahat abhi tak aisa kuch hua hi nahin he
 He said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also shared the stage with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, so did Kejriwal join Trinamool Congress
 cricket salaahkaar samiti (siesi) ke sadsy rahete hue indian premier lig (ipel) frenchiji ke mentor pad ko swikar karne ko lekar uthe hiton ke takaraav vivaad ke kaaran sachin tendulkar, vivies
 Laxman on Tuesday, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Ombudsman D
 ke
 Appeared to Jain
 bahut se logon ko lagata he yah pataa nahin he ki board ke nae samvidhan ke astitv main aane ke baad sachin, lakshmana or saurabh ganguli board kii kisi bhi samiti kaa hissaa banane ke liye uplabdh nahin rahenge
 This means that the services of these three players were not fully taken as all three were appointed only to select the head coach of the Indian team
 in teenon kii siesi ne 2016 or 2017 main bhartiya team kaa coach niyukt kiya tha
 Even the Committee of Administrators (COA) had not given much time to these three to appoint the head coach of the women's team
 bisisiai ke senior adhikari ne ieenes se baat karte hue bataaya ki kis tarah board ne bhartiya cricket ke teen diggajon kii sevaaon ko jaaya kar diya
 The officer said, 'it is very sad
 maujuuda halaat main teenon ko lokapal ke saamne jane ko majaboor kar diya jahaan sioe lokapal se kah sake ki yah teenon 'saaf taur se' hiton ke takaraav ke mudde main ghire hai
 The COA did not even fully utilize the services of these three giants of Indian cricket
 'adhikari ne kaha, 'nae samvidhan ke mutabik yah teenon paanch saal ke baad kisi bhi samiti kaa hissaa nahin ho sakate or yah niyam 2020 ke baad inhen baahar kar degaa
 Does the system working professionally in the board know what they have lost? He did not even give enough time to appoint these three as the coach of the women's team
 kam dekhnaa badi beemaari he
 'another official said that this' clearly' issue of conflict of interest is unwarranted by the COA
 adhikari ne kaha, 'vah yah kehane kii sthiti main bilkul nahin hai
 Take the example of Sachin, is he getting any money from BCCI for staying in Mumbai Indians or CAC? So where is the issue of conflict of interest? Also, you cannot add him to any cricket committee from 2020 onwards
 ek diggaj jisane 24 saal 25 sijanon tak desh ke liye cricket kheli vah kabhi bhi chayankarta banane ke liye yogya nahin hoga
 According to the new BCCI constitution, a person who has been part of a cricket committee for five years will not be able to be part of any other committee in future
 is niyam kii maane to siesi jo 2015 main niyukt kii gai thi uske paas sirf ek saal kaa samay he
 After this, Sachin, Ganguly and Laxman will not be able to be part of any cricket committee
 ek or buree baat yah he ki is tigadi ko jab siesi ke sadasyon ke taur par 2015 main chunaa gaya tha tab in purv khilaadiyon ko laane kaa makasad yah tha ki rashtriya team kaa pradarshan sudhara jaae or saath hi bharat ko vishwa main sarvshereshth team banane ke liye rodmap taiyaar kiya jaae, lekin beete chaal saal main is samiti ne aadhikarik taur par sirf do kaam kiye hai- 2016 main anil kumble ko rashtriya team kaa coach niyukt kiya gaya uske baad jab unka kaarykaal samaapt ho gaya to 2017 main phir ravi shastri ko team kaa coach niyukt kiya gaya
 The sad thing is that these veterans who have long served the sport now have to prove that it is not a matter of conflict of interest

 becoward state hone ke naate jo phayda tha vah bhi biarjief ke band hote hi khatm ho gaya
 We were also harmed by that

 Bihar should get special state status
 'bihar ke siem ne kaha ki hamaari maang he ki centre sanchalit yojanaon ke tahat paisa rajyon ko mili
 The Prime Minister said that he will listen to our demands
 paanch saal ke liye 1 lakh 20 hajaar karod rupee kii yojana manjuur ho chuki he
 Nitish said, 'we have made one thing clear to the Prime Minister that Bihar needs help under the new schemes
 ham chaahate hai ki jharkhand ke alag hone ke baad centre hamaari madad kare or yah baat centre bhi achche se samajhati he
 'bharat Ratna was welcomed to Vajpayee
 Nitish Kumar welcomed the decision of Modi government to give Bharat Ratna to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on this occasion
 nitish ne kaha, 'unhen sammaan dena acchhee baat he
 We welcome it
 ' duusari ore, janata parivaar ke mudde par nitish ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 The matter of joining the Janata Parivar is not stuck, but further steps are yet to be taken
 gauratlab he ki ganga safai par piem modi ne mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaai he, jisase thik pehle bihar ke siem ne modi darbar main hajiri lagaai he
 This meeting is also important in the sense that the two leaders are considered to be opposing each other at the ideological level
 endie ke ghatak dal ke taur par jediu kii rukhsati ke peeche bhi nitish or modi ke bich kii duuri vajah bani thi

 Just think if someone knows that in the next few moments only one of life and death is to be saved, then what will be spent on that moment? a terrorist came to blow up an Afghan army camp in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, by tying a bomb to his chest, but the Afghan army caught it before he could do so
 haalanki tab tak khud afgaan sena ko pataa nahin tha ki iske seene par barood bandhaa hua he par shikanje main lene ke baad jaise hi sena ko pataa chalaa sabhi ke hosh ud gaye
 Till then no one knew how the bomb tied on the chest would explode? From the timer or from the remote? Every passing moment was fatal, so the Afghan army made a decision by risking its life
 faisla yah ki is maanav bam ko gaadi main daal kar shahar se dur sunsaan jagah par le jaaya jaae, taaki bam fate bhi to nuksaan zyada naa ho
 After this, both the hands of the terrorist were tied backwards and also both the legs together so that they could not explode at any cost
 iske baad jalalabad se milon dur is suicide bombar ko ek maidan ke bich-bich laayaa jaataa he
 The bomb tied on his chest was carried out by an embezzled officer of the bomb disposal squad
 oparation shuru ho usase pehle ye tay kar liya jaataa he ki aatankwaadi koi aisi harakat naa kare jisase bam fat jaae
 So the Afghan army takes him under gunfire and spreads all around
 oparation shuru hone ke pehle aatankwaadi pani maangata he
 He requests that his hands be opened so that he can drink water
 iske baad bhi sena kaa ek jawan himmat dikhaata he, vah pani kii bottle lekar uske kareeb jaataa he or apane haathon se use pani pilaataa he
 After drinking water, the army orders the terrorist wearing a shalwar kurta to lie down on the ground, along with a warning that if he tries to do his body at all, he will be shot if he jerks him off 
 iske baad kisi tarah us belt ko kholaa jaataa he, jisamen bam tha
 After opening the belt, it is known that it had so much gunpowder which would have killed hundreds of people
 bam ke saath-saath aatankwaadi ne seene par hathgole bhi lataka rakhe the
 Apart from the bomb, he hid an AK-47 rifle and several bullets in the body
 jism se bam alag hote hi ab khatra chal chukaa tha
 After that the bomb is rendered useless, later the army sends the captured terrorist to jail and thus the most dangerous operation to destroy the live bomb reaches its end

 Veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh described Indian captain Virat Kohli as a serious cricketer and said his responsibilities have improved his game
 harbhajan ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha ki viraat behad gambhir cricketer hai, unhen jimmedaariyaan lenaa pasand he or vah team ke anya khilaadiyon se bhi yahi ummid karte hai
 This actually benefits the team and the team performs better than expected
 sachin tendulkar or kohli ke bich tulana ke bare main harbhajan ne kaha ki ve donon alag yugon main khele hai or unhone alag tarah ke gendbaajon kaa saamana kiya he isliye tulana anuchit hogi

 tii-20 match main team das overon main chaar paanch wicket le leti he or vanade match main bhi yahi ummid karti he
 You may have to wait 30–35 overs to take two wickets on England pitches
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Regarding the comparison between Sachin Tendulkar and Kohli, Harbhajan said that they have both played in different eras and they have faced different bowlers so the comparison would be unfair

 cooler lagaate, jagajeet ji-chitra ji kii gazalon kaa koi casette tapericorder main fansaate or shaam tak suna karte, raat tak gunagunaaya karte
 To tell the truth, the map of Ghazal in the raw soil of the hearts and hearts was made here
 ghar or vidisha kaa maahaul khaasaa saahitiyik tha
 So this hobby later became a fit for saying ghazals while climbing
 babuji naaraaz hote, 'chale hai kavi-shaayar banane
 First of all, become a life if you are engaged in a job by reading and writing
 ' main unki is jhallahat kaa jawaab maa ko diya karata - 'aap dekhiegaa main bada hokar gazalen hi kahuunga or ek din meri gazalen jagajeet singh ji gaayenge
 Mother smiled and said- 'amen
 ' dua ke taur par niklaa yahi lafz baad main mere pehle ghazal sangrah kaa sheershak bana - amin
 Later, in Vidisha itself, the important names of contemporary poetry Narendra Jain ji and poet friends Braj Srivastava, Ravindra Swapnil Prajapati, Alok Putul, Ashutosh Dubey and Pawan Karan started getting up and running
 samakaleen kavita or saahitiyik paridrishya main kya ho rahaa he
 What is his direction? isse baraabar apadet hota rahaa
 That is, the entire childhood of my ghazalkar was spent in the atmosphere of new poetry
 bhopal nazadiq tha
 Run and go to Bharat Bhavan
 kisi bade kavi yaa shaayar kaa kavita-paath sunanaa, kisi naatak kaa manchan dekhnaa
 Search books phir vidisha kaa apana saahitiyik vaataavaran
 At the same time, the work of editor, reading and writing in Ramakrishna Publications
 is sab ne achetan par gaharaa asar daalaa
 Silently prepared my creator
 mujhe lagata he mere bheetar baithe gazalkaar ke saath jo kuch acha hua usamen yah ek bada factor he, jisane meri soch-samaj ko or bhi viksit kiya
 Your ghazal collection Amen has brought laurels to the world, but you have also published a story collection - Afreen, when and how did you like to write stories? My stories are only an extension of my ghazals
 aap dekhenge to kai kahaniyon main jo bimb aae hai wo aapako meri gazalon ke hi pratibimb lagenge
 Ghazal has its own circumference
 seemaa he
 When somewhere, it seemed that the matter here wants expansion
 ghazal main ye baat kahi nahin ja sakati, to kahaniyon kii taraf rukh kar liya
 There was no planned plan behind writing stories
 isiilie kabhi koi gambhir daavedaari bhi nahin kii kahani-lekhak ke rup main
 Get started with the light of youth
 yahaan ek shararti muskaan sanlagn he
 a creator's youth lies in the freshness and concerns of his works
 jab tak uski rachanaatmakataa main taazgi he, nayaapan or nae sarokaar hai wo jawan he
 That is why i am always composed and positive
 or sadaa kuch na kuch nayaa karte rahane main juta rahata hum
 a friend once said - 'work and keep doing it
 isse behatar or kuch nahin
 'I have added to this mantra that - yes, nothing more positive than that
 isiilie har vaqt sakriy or sakaaratmak rahata hum
 i stay young aapke urdu lafzon, lekhan or talaffuz se kisi ko bhi rashq ho saktaa he
 Acquired Urdu training or learned by writing and writing? bashir badr sahab kaa sher he-duniya main kahin unki talim nahin hotido chaar kitabon ko ghar main padhaa jaataa hamere liye meri talim kaa har safha ghar main hi khulaa
 mother-babuji had a passion for Urdu and a deep understanding of literature
 bade bhai anand sahar geet kehete the
 My elder brother Arun, who passed away recently, lived like any other soul
 ghar main aksar adbi mahafilen, bahasein or saahitiyik baithken hoti rahati thim
 So, manure and water kept on getting by and slowly the plant continued to silt
 aap patrkaar hai, tis par shaayar bhi hai, is combination kaa aapke nijee jivan par koi khaas asar to padataa hoga? aap khud ko kya kahlaana pasand karenge, duniya bhar main mushaayare padhane vaala ek vinamr patrkaar yaa channel main naukari karne vaala ek vinamr shaayar? vinamrata to aapkaa sabase prakat gun he, donon hi sthitiyon main is shabd ko hataane kii himmat nahin kar paaya
 Actually, one thing that is most important for both the characters is - condolences
 patrkaar bhi kavi kii tarah samvedansheel hota he
 He, too, has a penny-like sensation as well as a sharp vision
 isiilie in donon kirdaaron ko main alag karke kabhi nahin dekh paaya
 Perhaps then, there has not been any uneasiness in life at home or outside
 haa, aap duniyavi baat karen to usamen antar zarur he
 tv's land is coarse and the world fast-paced, while the poet's land is soft and the world like a pause
 patrakarita kii baat chali hi he to bataaen ki vidisha ke ramakrishna prakaashan se bhopal or phir bhopal se dilli tak kaa ye safar kaise sambhav hua
 While writing in Vidisha's Ramakrishna Prakashan, there was great freedom of writing
 samay or maahaul to tha hi
 So at that time, he wrote independent writing in many newspapers and magazines of the country
 vishesh rup se india today, outluk or dainik bhaskar ke liye niyamit rup se likhaa
 One or two columns also started in Bhaskar
 kollam charchit hue to bhaskar bhopal se bulaava aa gaya
 Till yesterday, the work which was done as a freelancer turned into a full-fledged job
 bhopal kii print patrakarita se dilli kii tivi patrakarita main laane kaa shrey varisht patrkaar hemanth sharma ji (india tivi) ko jaataa he
 An interesting memory
 aapke saath share kar rahaa hum ki rajat sharma ji ne meraa intervyuu liya tha or phir intervyuu ke baad hemanth ji ne aadesh par mujhe der tak apni gazalen sunaani padi thim
 Especially amma-babuji
 qareeb do baras india tivi main bitaye
 It is said that your past actions dictate the direction of your future, so as a reflection of the activism you showed for India Today while living in Vidisha, a call came from TV Today Network
 to qareeb aath baras ajtak main kaam kiya
 Now, i am Doordarshan's National Channel Advisor since July 2014
 ye bahut creative kaam he
 i am always fond of doing something creative, so i am very happy with this work as well
 'chintan-darshan jivan-sarjan ruh-nazar par chai ammaa' ko aapane kuchhek jagahon par 'dhoop hui to anchal banakar kone-kone chai ammaa' karke padhaa
 Why was there such a need? jagajeet singh ji ko jaataa he
 When he was recording this ghazal for one of his albums, he made this change through the song
 tabase yahi sabaki jubaan par chadh gaya
 This is the title of his last album Ghazal, which you will soon hear
 aap likhte hantumhaare paas aata hum to saanse bhig jaati hanmuhabbat itani milti he ki ankhen bhig jaati haapke padhane ke lahaze main bhi ek sahaj madhurata he
 Something that someone will repeat your Ashraar, will be more humble than their nature
 shaayad yah aapke vyaktitv kaa gun hi hoga jo gazalon main sahaj hi utar aata hoga? yaa likhte hue ek atirikt prayaas ke tahat aap madhur bane rahane kii eemaandaar koshish karte hai?main likhte samay, bas likhata hum
 i do not think much kyonki sochane kaa kaam dimaag kaa hota he
 And as soon as the business of the mind is added to the functioning of the heart, the whole writing business becomes
 isiilie jo dil main sahajata se aata he vahi kaagaz par utarataa he or vahi jubaan se nikalataa he
 In this conversation, you have a dis-advantage that i also know you personally
 isliye main jaanata hum ki aap ek sahaj or swasth hasya bodh ke maalik hai
 But it was difficult for me to guess before i met you
 aisa or kya kya he jo saat sandukon main band kiye baithe hai aap?ek rachanaakaar kai paraton main jeeta he
 Time and circumstances decide which layer it will react with
 ‘amin’ or ‘afarin’ ke baad ab kya likhane kii taiyaari he?bas likhte rahane kii taiyaari he
 Always
 har ghadi
 In which mold will he cast without thinking
 ek sawaal aapaki rachana prakriya ko lekar bhi he
 Irshad Kamil says that he writes as a trainee poet and then two-three days later re-evaluates his lion as a master poet
 kai shaayar bimbon main hi sochate hai
 You will also have a thinking process? i do a lot of recruits
 apane hi likhe ko nayaa karata rahata hum
 i believe that when something is not created, we should reacquire
 usase criation kii lalak bani rahati he
 Does not panic much in the thinking process
 jo sahajata se aata he use aane detaa hum
 What kind of poet do you think people have accepted you as? Some genres of literature are popular
 kisi kii shaayari main baghaavat hoti he, kisi main siyaasi coment to kisi main husn haaavee rahata he
 According to Alok Srivastava, what is there in his poetry? Relationship
 main apane se jude har rishte kaa bahut aadar karata hum
 i try my best to save and maintain them in this desperate period
 idhar jab kai zimmedaar or adbi logon ne 'rishton kaa kavi' kahana shuru kar diya to acha laga
 The affection i have for human relationships separately, underlined, was a joy
 main un logon kii bahut izzat karata hum jo apane aasapaas ke rishton ko sammaan dete hai
 That is why this element comes out most in my poem
 ‘ammaa’ or ‘babuji’ jaise masterpis ke alaava aapane yah bhi likhaa kinajdiki akasar duuri kaa kaaran bhi ban jaati hesoch samajhakar milanaa julna apane rishtedaaron mendo ek din naaraaz rahenge babu ji kii fitrat haichand kahaan tedha rahata he saalon saal sitaron serishte-naaton ko lekar jo sanjidagi or samaj aapaki gazalon main he, uskaa zarur koi itihaas rahaa hoga? aapke padhane-sunne waalon ko acha lagegaa agar aap apni zindgaai ke kuch qisse saajha karen, jinhone aap ko aisi samajhadaari di?qareeb 25 saal kaa tha jab maa kaa dehanth hua
 i stayed with him right from the beginning in my life
 aap kahenge ki usamen kya nai baat he ? har baccha rahata he ? lekin nahin, meri maa kaamkaaji thim
 While in the administrative service, she was not like domestic mothers
 unka jivan, darshan, chintan, nazariyaa, samaj or sab kuch auron se bilkul alag tha
 i saw the world around me with his eyes and condolences
 mujh par unka bahut gaharaa prabhaav he
 i often say that my mother lives within me
 isliye yahaan se kuch galat nahin ho saktaa
 There should be some woman within each man
 kyonki dariiton ke hare-bhare rahane ke liye nami bahut zaruri hoti he
 Which is the most memorable Mushaira? Mushaira is still a girl
 aap ek-do satahi mushaairon ko chhod den to hamaare desh or duniya ke tamaam mushaairon main ab tak 'tilak or tapiyaan' ghus nahin pai hai
 So for every poet like me and me, almost every Mushaira remains a memorable Mushaira
 lekin saal 2012 main doha-qatar main ek mushayara hua tha, wasim barelvi sahab kii sadaarat or mansoor osmani sahab kii nizaamat main, use main apane sabase kaamyaab or yaadgaar mushaayare ke taur par yaad rakhata hum
 In the year 2007, in Kali Sammelan of Lal Qilay, i could hardly forget my success, after which a new identity was found in Delhi
 ve insaan jo alok shrivastav ke shaayar or insaan ko bargad-si chhaanv muhaiyaa karaate hai?mere apane
 Friend-friend
 rishte-ghar
 Where is one that i can mention? Everyone's prayers are included in this visit
 yah bhi likhaa aapane kiaaye the mir khwab main kal daant kar gaekya shaayari ke naam par kuch bhi nahin rahaanai peedi par aarope lagate hai ki ve shaayari ke adab se navaqif hai
 Add to this the question that how do superficial things get the space of being popular in the name of Shayari? Is it time to assume that people have stopped understanding good poetry? Yes, this is the Lion Tanz, on that phase of poetry in which poetry is not only happening, everything else is happening in the name of poetry
 lekin acchhee kavita samaapt ho gai aisa main bilkul nahin maanata
 i go to countless forums in the country and the world where only poetry is heard
 latifai-kavitaaon or satahi-popular-jumalon ko vahaan pair tak rakhane kii zamin bhi nahin milti
 Secondly, i believe that with whom you stand, more important than that, in which role you are standing
 aap apni bhoomika main tatasth rahiye, agar aap acha kar rahe hai
 If you are doing level, then one day he will definitely get approval
 aap manze hue geetkaar bhi hai
 According to you, why Hindi writers do not make a place in the film world despite writing well
 iske liye unhen khud main kya badlaav karne chahie
 Is it also a reason that some eat-and-eat people in Hindi literature have promoted marketing as 'a bad thing', so newcomers are afraid to do their marketing? The film is a completely different genre
 wo bahut demanding hai
 Our Hindi writer or poet is a mind-writer
 uske man main jo aata he vahi rachataa he or phir apane hi rache hue ko der tak or dur tak jeeta he
 The work of writing Demand and Amazing, does not attract him much, perhaps that is why his track is not able to sit there
 iske barakes urdu shaayaron main aap dekhen to ek lambi parampara aapako aisi nazar aegi jinhone filmon main bhi kaamyaab geet likhe or adab main bhi wo koob navaaze gaye
 You can say that - in this case, perhaps Urdu ones are more flexible than Hindi ones
 namvar singh ko aap babuji kehete hai
 Tell them something about your relationship? There are some relations outside of literature

 They have got a lot of pampering, love and blessings

 What was the experience like Dushyant Kumar Award of MP Sahitya Akademi, International Pushkin Award in Russia and now International Hindi Award for Hindi Ghazal in America

 Now that the Dargah has expressed its inability to remove it, the Supreme Court has issued this order

 ravivaar ko shapath grahan ke turant baad jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantrimufti mohammad saidane jo vivaadit bayaan diya tha, us par somvaar ko loksabhaa main bhi khub hangaamaa hua
 The central government and the BJP shied away from the statement
 lekin mufti apane bayaan par ab bhi kaayam hai
 The special thing is that he has also got the support of his MP daughter Mehbooba on this issue
 mufti ne somvaar ko kaha, 'maine kuch galat nahin kaha or bevajaah hi til kaa tad banaaya ja rahaa he
 'anantnag MP and his daughter Mehbooba Mufti also say that her father did not say anything wrong

 Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha, 'our government and BJP completely disassociate themselves from the statement of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, in which he has given credit to Pakistan and Hurriyat for the smooth conduct of the assembly elections
 main yah bayaan pradhanmantri ke saath charchaa karke or unki sahmati ke baad de rahaa hum
 He said that the credit for conducting assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir in a peaceful manner goes to the Election Commission, Army, paramilitary forces and people of the states
 rajnath or unki party ke netaa kuch bhi safai dete rahen, lekin mufti ne apane bayaan par adig rahakar saaf kar diya he ki aage unki ranneeti kya rahane vaali he

 'significantly, amid the demands of the opposition parties, the Election Commission on Saturday last gave orders till January 11 to implement this by covering the statues of Mayawati and elephants that were in place in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar districts

 Anil Singh Bisen, counsel for the petitioner, thereafter requested the court to allow filing of amendments to remove the gaps

 What did Rajnath say? On Monday, on the allegations of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, 'I want to clarify, Madam Speaker, the government did not do anything in it, whatever work is going on, it is monitoring the Supreme Court
 Is running in baar-baar yah kahana ki sarkaar ne ye kar diya, sarkaar badi nirmam ho gai he, is prakaar ke aarope bebuniyaad hai

 hamaare desh kii jidipi main tex kaa hissaa abhi sirf 16 fisadi he, ise badhanaa hamaara lakshya he

 The problem is when you are not registering
 kyonki jo aapse khariddaari karne aa rahe hai, ve aapako register nahin paaenge to aapke kaarobaar par asar padegaa
 The minister said that we want all the rates and all the discounts to reach the common people
 ham jaanate hai ki jiesti se pehle, jo ham chhot dete hai wo antim graahak tak nahin pahunchataa he

 He said that the implementation of GST is a big opportunity, only big steps change the destiny of the country
 jetali bole ki isko lagu karne main kai netaaon kaa ahm role rahaa
 Ministers of many states greatly helped to pass this

 Jaitley said that there will be many such occasions when the Congress party will have to think a lot
 arun jetali ne kaha ki puri duniya main privet sector sarkaar se aage rahata he, lekin is baar itihaas badla he
 We have been saying for a long time that we will implement July 1, and we are implementing this date
 hamane 18 june tak sabhi chizon ke daam tay kar liye the, 1 july kaa faisla sirf meraa faisla nahin ye jiesti council ne tay kiya tha
 The Finance Minister said that there are problems initially on doing something new, but it is rectified
 unhone kaha ki is desh kii kai visheshtaayen hai
 When demonetisation came into force, people said that GDP would fall, but nothing happened
 notebandi ke baad shuru kuch dinon main hi dikkat hui thi, jin deshon main jiesti fail hua he vah kuch alag paristhitiyaan thi
 Our country has a different system from those countries
 jo log aalochana karte hai unhen samajhnaa chahie, pichley 70 saalon se hamaari sarkarein udhaar lekar sarkaar chalaa rahi hai
 He said that if everyone starts paying taxes, there will be no debt
 desh ko chalaane ke liye tex system ko acha karnaa kaaphi jaruri he
 Jaitley said that we are 130 crore people, there are 71 lakh people in this country with more than 5 lakh incomes, 61 lakh of them are salaries
 baaki log main sabhi log tex nahin dete hai
 If we talk about indirect tax, then only 80 lakh people pay tax in our country
 hamen ummid he ki aage badhkar tex dene waalon kii sankhya badhegi
 Arun Jaitley said that people are coming to a new system, so there is panic
 vyapaariyon kii dikkaton par jetali ne kaha ki yah sabhi ritern software se bhari jaaengi, isse unako koi dikkat nahin hogi
 He said that there is a large section of traders in the country who are welcoming it
 jetali ne kaha ki kisi bhi system main use bigaadane vaale rahenge, lekin unke khilaaf bhi ection liya jayega
 On the GSTN network, he said that the old system would be completely dismantled after September 15
 har rajya sarkaar ko jiesti ke upar ek mat hi lagu karnaa padegaa, agar aap har faisle main hissedaar hai to usapar kaayam rahanaa jaruri he
 There has been a delay in Jammu and Kashmir because of Section 370
 vahaan kii sarkaar ko alag se apana kanoon bananaa padegaa
 When i became finance minister, the leader of the National Conference was the chairman of a committee
 or aaj wo iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The Finance Minister of Kashmir has supported us in every meeting, hopefully it will be passed there too soon
 jetali ne kaha ki agar jiesti ke baad kisi rajya sarkaar ko ghaataa hoga to 5 saal tak uski bharpai kii jaaegi, agar jammu-kashmir main ye lagu nahin hota he to vahaan ke logon ko kaaphi mushkil hogi
 The government there should think about this
 vitt mantri bole ki congress kii har rajya sarkaar ne petrol or sharaab ko jiesti main rakhane kaa virodh kiya he
 Petroleum is currently under GST, but will be implemented only after the Council's decision
 vahiin real state par bhi aisa hi hua he, manish sisodiya ke prastaav par main raji tha lekin kai anya logon ne kaha ki pehle jiesti lagu ho jaae uske baad use lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that the state government is not ready on the issue of alcohol
 arun jetali ne kaha ki hawaii chappal or gaadi par ek jaisaa tex nahin laga sakate hai, isliye alag-alag tex slab laae gaye hai
 Jaitley said that there is a lot of difference between writing and implementing columns about GST, on which we are charging 6% tax, we cannot keep it in the slab of 12%
 isliye 5% kaa slab banaaya gaya he
 He said that if we had brought the same tax slab, inflation would have increased to a large extent, so different tax slabs have been created
 hamane daamon ko kam karne kii koshish kii he
 Due to the implementation of GST, many builders are trying to collect tax wrongly, people have to avoid it
 china or bharat ke mudde par jetali ne kaha ki bhutan ne bayaan diya he ki wo bhoomi bhutan kii he, hamaare unke saath unki suraksha karne kaa sambandh hai, isliye ham vahaan par hai
 On China's reminiscing of 1962, Jaitley said that the circumstances of 1962 were different, and the situation today is different
 hamen is baat ko samajhnaa hoga
 Jaitley termed it irresponsible when Congress opposed the special session of Parliament
 unhone kaha ki agar din kaarykram hota to ham kaarykram main aate, raat ko kaarykram he to nahin aate ye ek alag tark he
 Jaitley said that i will put it far ahead in the reforms so far, we can also call the 1991 reforms quite big
 manish sisodiya, upmukhyamantri dilli sarkaar ( ankar - shweta singh )manish sisodiya ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa ye idia kaaphi acha he, lekin ise lagu karne kaa tarika nahin he
 We talked about zero percent tax, but many types of taxes have been imposed
 chaay ke biscuit par 28 % tex koun de paaegaa
 He said that this is the first time that clothes will also be taxed
 ye jiesti sirf sarkaar kii aamadani badhaane vaala tex he
 Manish said that with the implementation of GST, inflation will increase significantly
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne hamaare kai idia maane, unhone is kai tarah se isamen acchhee bahes kii
 But failed to take a big decision, a lot can be done with GST
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki 28% tex desh ke aam aadmi ke liye kaaphi zyada he
 He said that the wrong decision to keep alcohol and real state out of it, both of them should have been brought under the purview of GST
 aap cement jaisi chizon par jiesti laga rahe hai par real state nahin lagaana galat he
 Sisodia said that we have made a very good change in the tax system in Delhi, it would have been very good if the central government had taken people into confidence
 manish sisodiya bole ki abhi bhi mere paas isko lekar sawaal zyada hai, or unke jawaab kam hai
 He said that the central and state government will benefit more from its implementation, not the common man
 unhone kaha ki jiesti laana koi aparaadh nahin he, lekin isse janata ko phayda hona jaruri he lekin aisa nahin dikh rahaa he
 Still people are afraid about it
 sisodiya ne kaha ki iskaa jashn manaanaa sahi nahin he, ye bina jashn ke lagu hona chahie tha
 He said that anyone who has an understanding of tax will understand that now he has moved from VAT to the grip of GST
 unhone kaha ki aisa system hona chahie ki log khushi-khushi tex den, aisa maahaul nahin bananaa chahie ki log chori karnaa shuru karaden
 If our government reduced the tax, the revenue of tax has increased
 ye koi aazaadee nahin he, kya ham pehle aarthik aazaadee main the
 If it is freedom, then we do not know the meaning of freedom
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki abhi koi bhi nahin kah saktaa ki vah jiesti kaa export he
 GST will benefit when people start paying tax happily
 agar vyapaariyon ko lagata he ki kuch galat ho rahaa he, to virodh karnaa unka haq he
 He said that middle class traders in Delhi are going to face a lot of problems with this
 bivek debaroy, sadsy niti ayog ( ekanr - rajeev dube)niti ayog ke sadsy bivek debaroy ne kaha ki bharat duniya kii pehla federell desh he jo ki jiesti lagu kar rahaa he
 He said that goods should be subjected to direct tax, indirect tax should not be levied
 bivek ne kaha ki yahi kaaran he ki kai chijen jiesti se baahar hai
 This is just a GST, if the GST that we had dreamed of would have been implemented, it would have benefited GDP a lot
 unhone kaha ki isse phayda bhi hoga or nuksaan bhi hoga
 GST has been discussed for 17 years, deadline has been fixed for this many times but it is now being implemented
 unhone kaha ki ye ek achche kadam kii shuruyaat he
 If we had waited for the ideal GST, it would have taken another 17 years
 debaroy ne kaha ki jiesti ko lagu karne main har party ek baat par sahamat hui he, jiesti council ne bhi is par kaaphi kaam kiya he
 Council will also have to meet continuously so that it can run smoothly
 unhone kaha ki jiesti kaa acha rigelt aane main kaaphi lanbaa samay bhi lag saktaa he
 Bivek said that it may show the effect of inflation in some sectors, but it is not that inflation will be there in many sectors
 haa, ham ye zarur kah sakate hai ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad kuch samay ke liye mahangaai bad sakati he
 Congress leader Anand Sharma (anchor- Rajdeep Sardesai) Congress leader Anand Sharma said that it is wrong to call our protest a boycott, we have never called GST a spectacle
 hamaari sarkaar hi ise laai thi, jab sirf ek mukhyamantri ne virodh kiya tha wo sirf narendra modi ne hi kiya tha
 If we had done the same then GST would not have been implemented today
 raat ko jashn main shaamil naa hona koi raajnneetik virodh nahin he
 This happened at the time of independence, after that it happened for the second time after completing 25 years of independence and then 50 years later
 har baar congress shaamil rahi he
 Right now there is a different price everywhere, but there will be one tax from GST
 anand sharma ne kaha ki yah sirf ek jashn he
 The Congress has also done many historical works during its tenure, but have we ever done such a program in the Central Hall
 vipaksh tali bajaane ke liye nahin baitha he
 PM Modi should explain why he opposed the GST for 7 years
 unhone kaha ki sonia gandhi, manmohan singh kii sooyeeboojh ke kaaran hi GST lagu ho rahaa he
 He said that the government will have to explain to the people how they will work after its arrival
 sarkaar ne jiesti network kaa troyal ran nahin kiya, hamaari sabhi rajya sarkaron ne jiesti ko paas kiya he
 He said that we have opposed the government on the issue of GST
 ham bas ye kah rahe hai ki centre sarkaar ravaiya gaiyr-jimmedaarana he, sarkaar ko is maamle main jaldbaaji nahin kerani chahie
 We are not protesting, we are just suggesting
 anand sharma bole ki aaj ke samay main virodh karnaa deshadroh ho gaya he, sardaar patel ne gandhi ji kii hatya ke baad RSS par bain laga diya he
 He said that it is meaningless to compare Modi with Nehru, Nehru fought in the battle against the British and went to jail
 lekin piem modi ne kuch nahin kiya, unki vichaardhaaraon ne bhi aazaadee main kuch nahin kiya
 He said that we do not have to take any credit for this, let only PM Modi take credit
 ham kah rahe hai ki koi nae rivaaj naa banaae jaaen, 25 saal, 50 saal, 75 saal hone par hi aise kaarykram hone chahie
 He said that even if he sneezes today, it becomes historical
 wo jo bhi karte hai sab aitihaasik ban jaataa he
 Anand Sharma said that we had put all our doubts before the government, the government should have trained traders
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar kaa samarthan karnaa unka nirnay he, piem modi or nitish kumaar ne kai baar ek duusare kii aarti utaari he
 We are not creating an anti Modi front, our fight is with BJP and RSS, not just with Modi
 gorakshakon par piem modi ke bayaan par kaha ki modi itane dinon se chup kyon the, isse desh kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa he

 com / mq56aleczd Bihar Chief Minister and JDU National President Nitish Kumar today met Prime Minister Modi amidst opposition's attempts to mobilize for the presidential election and the grand alliance exercise for 2019
 mulaakaat ke baad nitish kumaar ne patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki is mulaakaat ke dauraan ganga or kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar baatcheet hui
 If Nitish is to be believed, during his meeting, he appealed to send a team of officials before June 10 on the Ganga problem
 endie ke shaamil hone ke sawaal par nitish ne kaha ki is mukalaat ko lekar log jo maayan nikaalnaa chahen,nikaalen
 But his meeting was focused only on the development works of Bihar
 saath hi unhone kaha ki bihar main gathbandhan kii sarkaar sahi disha main kaam kar rahi he or partiyon ke bich koi matbhed nahin he
 Then if someone raises a question, they do not consider it appropriate to give their response to it
 iske alaava bihar ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki morishas ke piem ke sammaan main yojit kaarykram main aane ke liye unhen nimantran mila tha, isliye unka is kaarykram main shariq hona ferj tha
 He said that the JDU chief, but not the chief minister of Bihar, was invited to the event
 nitish dilli main unke saath lunch karenge
 After lunch, Nitish Kumar and PM Modi will have a separate conversation about cleaning Ganga
 isse pehle kal sonia gandhi ne vipakshi netaaon ke saath lunch par mulaakaat kii thi
 In this, political speculation about Nitish Kumar's absence was intensified

 It is clear from the RTI revelations that his journey so far has been disputed by the allocation of plot given in Bandra East of Mumbai
 multah pichde varg ke chatravaas ke liye yah plat arakshit tha
 That reservation was removed and given to Associate Journals
 saath hi isse jude tex ko bhi maaf kiya gaya
 These decisions were taken by the then Congress Chief Ministers

 Pakistan's civil aviation regulator has given this information on Wednesday
 niamak ne bataaya ki pakistan main karyrat vibhinn airlines ke 16 payalton or 65 cabin kru ke license nilambit kar die hai
 According to the report published in Dawn, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gave this information to the Supreme Court during the hearing of a case related to degree verification of pilots and other employees of various airlines
 siee ke vakil ne mukhya nyaayadhish saaqib nisaar kii adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey peeth ko bataaya ki niamak ne 6 adhikariyon ko chhodkar (jo abhi videsh main hai) sabhi airline karmchaariyon kii degree ke satyaapan kii prakriya puri kar lee he
 The report said that during the verification process, the degrees of 16 pilots and 65 cabin crew turned out to be fake
 jiske baad in sadasyon ke license nilambit kar die gaye
 During the hearing, the Chief Justice stated that there was a perception that officers were acting in a hurry in the case due to court orders
 unhone kaha ki ham kisi kii aajeevika ko pratibandhit nahin karnaa chaahate hai, lekin karmchaariyon kaa record sahi hona chahie
 Therefore the airline employees have been suspended

 According to 'indian Express' news, Indian negotiators worked with Beijing for the last three months to convince China against terror
 dilachasp baat ye he ki ye baatcheet us samay chal rahi thi, jab donon deshon ke bich doklam vivaad bhi charchaa main tha
 During the talks, the Indian side told the Chinese negotiators that as a 'major power' their country should play the role of 'big responsibility'

 One of the key elements in this strategy has been that at a time when the US is not taking the role of global ruler under the leadership of Donald Trump, India felt that the Chinese would be eager to occupy that leadership position globally
 
 rajanyikon ko ye tab laga, jab chini raashtrapati shi jinping, is saal ke shuru main daavos gaye or vaishvikaran ke samarthak ban gaye
 At one time the new American administration under Trump was being viewed as partisan for protectionism

 After a few weeks of talking to him, he was quite excited at the prospect of looking good globally
 is kamyaabi ke baad bhartiya paksh ko ummid he ki ab jaish ke sargana masood ajahar par antarrashtriya pratibandh lagane kii raah khulegi

 The 2330 mah battery will not be able to run throughout the day using features like zoom, few hours of talk, data connectivity

 kasganj main bavaal kii aanch ab dhimi pad rahi he, lekin siyasat sulagane lagi he
 The deputy CM has even said that there is a big conspiracy behind it
 bada sawaal ye he ki bavaal shuru hone ke 48 ghante baad bhi dangaiyon par puri tarah kaabo kyon nahin paaya ja sakaa? kasganj main bhadki hinsa ke peeche ye paanch badi laaparvaahee saamne ai he
 1
 karfu kyon jaldi hataaya gaya26 janvari ke din bavaal shuru hone ke turant baad prashasan ne karfu lagaaya, lekin kuch ghante ke baad hi karfu hataakar ilaake main dhara 144 laga di gai
 The question arises as to why there was a rush to remove the curfew when tensions were prevailing
 maukey par 700 se 800 police waalon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood balavaayiyon ko kahaan se takat mil rahi he or wo aaj subah tak aagjanee or todphod karne main kaise kaamyaab rahe
 Why the rioters were given so much leeway that they could set fire
 2
 No top officer arrived from Lucknow, even on the third day after the violence in Kasganj, sporadic incidents of arson continued till Sunday morning
 bavaal ke agle din hi prashasan sakhti kaa daawa karata rahaa
 Despite this, the entire area continued to burn for 48 hours
 bavaali sadak par udham machaate rahe
 The negligence of the administration continued
 naa to aagjanee rukii or naa hi todphod
 No top officer arrived from Lucknow
 yani jile or range ke afasaron ke haath main hi sab kuch chhod diya gaya
 3
 deree se ection liya gayahinsa par prashasan ne bahut deree se ection liya
 In the beginning, if the seriousness of the matter was understood, then it would not have come here
 karfu jaldi hataane ke baad dangaiyon ko khuli chhot dene ke saath hi fouran koi dharpakad na karne se unka dussahas bad gaya, jisaki parinti tisare din bhi hinsa ke rup main hui
 However, now it is being talked about putting the accused up to Rasuka
 4
 Political rhetoric began after political violence began
 tisare din to khulkar akhilesh yadav se lekar mayawati tak maidan main aa gayi
 SP President and former Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav blamed the government officials for the Kasganj incident
 unhone to chandan gupta ko 50 lakh kaa muaavja dene kii maang bhi kar di he
 Also, there is talk of going to Chandan's house
 vahiin mayawati ne kaha ki maujuuda halaat se sabit hota he ki bhaajapa and company kaa har str par ‘ghor apradheekaran’ ho chukaa he
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari alleged that due to the negligence and mismanagement of the Uttar Pradesh government and local administration, there were clashes between the two communities in Kasganj
 5
 No BJP leader reached the pacification, even after 55 hours of violence, no government minister reached the spot
 kisi ne maukey par pahunchakar aman-chaiyn kaayam karne ke liye prayaas nahin kiya
 Peace meeting was also held today, no one showed interest in it
 koi bada netaa aage aata to tanaav kuch kam ho saktaa tha

 On the one hand, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken full responsibility of winning the BJP elections in Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, correcting the worsening conditions of the BJP in Gujarat and bringing the BJP back to the point from where he left, it is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister
 Has been pradhanmantri narendra modi7 march ko bharuch main mubani-dilli neshnal haive 8 ko jodate cabel brij kaa uddhaghatan karenge or ek jansabha ko bhi sambodhit karenge

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has come under attack from the opposition for the flaw in the allocation of coal mines, has made preparations for a retaliation, in which it can be said that private companies 1
 85 lakh karod rupee ke laabh kaa aankada ‘bhraamak’ he
 According to sources, the Prime Minister has prepared a six-point reply to cut the charges of opposition in Parliament, but due to disruption in the proceedings of both the houses, he has not been able to reply
 manmohan kaa is baat par jor he ki koyala block aavanton kisi company ke saath pakshpaat kiye bina puri tarah upyukt or paardarshee tareeke se kiya gaya
 Opposition parties are creating a ruckus on this issue and Parliament proceedings have not been going on for the last two days
 sutron ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri dwaara taiyaar jawaab kaa zyada jor is baat par he ki chhattisgarh, pashchim bengal, rajasthan, odisha or jharkhand rajyon kii sabhi gaiyr-samprag sarkaron ne varsh 2005 main nilaamee prakriya ke bare main kendra dwaara vidheyak laane kaa virodh kiya tha
 In response, he blamed the protests by the governments of these states for the delay in starting competitive bidding process in coal block allocation
 unke anusaar, ‘vibhinn pakshon, rajyon or mantralayon ke prastaav ke khilaaf hone ke baavjood koi bhi nayaa tarika amal main laane se pehle sambandhit kanoon main badlaav or aam sahmati banane kii zarurat hoti he
 However, the auction law through bidding has now been prepared
 koyala block aavanton main deree kaa bhi kaig ne apni report main zikr kiya he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said, 'whatever issues have been raised, they can give a satisfactory answer to all
 ’kaig kii report kaa pratwaad karte huye pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki isamen unhen ‘galtiyaan’ lagati hai
 The CAG report states that 1 to private sector companies due to various gaps in coal mine allocation between 2005 and 2009
 85 lakh karod rupee kaa laabh pahunchaaya gaya
 The Prime Minister says that the CAG has calculated this figure based on the allocation of 57 mines, while 31 of these coal mines have been made before 2006
 iske alaava nuksaan kii raashi ke anumaan ko bhi unhone bhraamak bataaya
 He said that the CAG has estimated the loss according to the value of Coal India, whereas private sector companies have different criteria about the cost
 manmohan ne sarkaar ke nitigat nirnay par kaig ke sawaal uthaane par bhi aapatti jataai he
 The CAG has mentioned the opinion of the Law Ministry in its report in which the Ministry has said that for this there should be an alternative or change in the law or the option of administrative instructions should be chosen to start competitive bidding
 yah mantralay kaa nitigat nirnay tha
 According to sources, on the charge of delay in making the law for auctioning through bidding, the Prime Minister says that it is not only due to the process that takes place but also in the making of the general law due to the deliberations in arriving at a decision by making an agreement
 It takes a long time
 is sambandh main sarkaar kaa kahana he ki koyala khan (rashtriyakaran) adhinium main sanshodhan kaa prastaav varsh 2001 se hi lambit padaa tha
 At that time, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power
 in baton par jor dene ke peeche sarkaar kaa makasad vidheyak ko sansad main rakhane se pehle hone vaale ‘vichaar vimarsh kii gambhirtha’ or ‘samvedansheel muddon par aam sahmati banane’ main lagane vaale samay se he
 The emphasis of the Prime Minister is also that guidelines and related procedures have to be prepared for starting competitive bidding process for auction of coal blocks for personal use
 samuchit vichaar vimarsh ke baad is saal 2 farvari ko niyam adhishuchet kar diye gayi
 Manmohan's answer would also be against the cag's plea that the coal ministry's plan to allocate coal blocks reserved for private use to them to increase coal production did not yield the desired results
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki desh main koyale kaa utpaadan varsh 2004
 05 to 2009
