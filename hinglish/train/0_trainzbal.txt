 There has been an uproar in the Congress over the Bhopal gas scandal
 is maamle main faisalaa aane ke baad paraten khul rahi hai, or sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The biggest question is who played an important role in absconding Anderson
 sawaal isliye ahm he ki 1984 main centre or rajya donon jagah congress kii sarkaar thi
 The Chief Minister was Arjun Singh, who is currently sitting silently but Diggi Raja has come to his rescue
 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv kah rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar kaa koi dosha nahin to udhar, congress ke hi netaa satyavrath chaturvedi, digvijay kii baat kii kaat pesh kar rahe hai or rajya sarkaar ko hi katghare main khadaa kar rahe hai
 Now the big question is why the then Chief Minister Arjun Singh is silent while there is a ruckus on this issue within the Congress
 bada sawaal yahi he ki aakhir kaise mukhya aaropee anderson bhaag niklaa
 Till now many faces have come out which are saying that they had received instructions from above
 bhopal ke tatkaaleen dm moti singh, espi swaraj puri ke baad ab payalat ne bhi vahi baat doharaai he
 Retired Captain Sondhi, the pilot of the plane from which Anderson had fled, has revealed that he got orders from CM House to keep the state aircraft ready
 media par aarope ke baad ho rahi aalochanaon se beparwaah aap netaa arvind kejariwal ne aaj phir se media par hamalaa kiya or kaha ki kya usamen narendra modi ke gujarat ke bare main sachhee kahani dikhaane kaa saahas he
 Starting his roadshow in Bangalore, Kejriwal, in a conversation with reporters, alleged that the media is not bringing the truth about the Chief Minister of Gujarat to the people
 media ke khilaaf tippaniyon ke liye media or raajnneetik dalon ke nishane par aae kejariwal ne kaha ki kya media main desh ke logon ko gujarat kii asli kahani dikhaane kaa saahas he? yah ek bada sawalia nishaan he
 Kejriwal had reportedly said that the entire media had been sold and that the media persons would be sent to jail after the issue was investigated after the party came to power
 unki is tippanee ke liye har ore unki aalochana ho rahi he do din ke daure ke dauraan kejariwal apni party ke liye dhan jutaney ke vaaste 20,000 rupee prati vyakti vaale ratribhoj main bhi shaamil ho rahe hai
 He will hold a road show in Chikkaballapur tomorrow before finishing his rally in Bengaluru
 pradhanmantri pad ke bijepi ke ummidavaar narendra modi par reliyon ke dauraan logon ko thagne kaa aarope lagaate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki log yah kah rahe hai
 Till now the media has not brought the truth about Modi to the public
 modi par aaropon ke samarthan main sabooton ke bare main puche jane par kejariwal ne kaha ki kisaanon kii sthiti dayaneey he kyonki unki jameen chin lee gai he
 In the campaign, Modi ji is being called the messiah of the farmers
 nahin, modi ji maseehaa nahin hai
 The farmers of the country have been lied to

 In this conversation, Uma Bharti openly discussed the Liberhan Commission report on the Babri demolition case
 bharti ne kaha ki report ko lekar kai baaten spasht nahin hai isile ise phir se padhane kii jarurat he
 He lashed out at Justice Liberhan, saying that the report which took 17 years to prepare and wasted crores of rupees, such a report could be prepared in a month
 unhone kaha ki report main koi bhi baat saaf nahin he
 When asked if a leader like Kalyan Singh, who has separated from BJP on the Liberhan Report and Uma Bharti himself, has not become together, he said that if all become one in the name of Ayodhya, then Ayodhya should be something of a matter Go unhone kaha ki ekta se hi mandir ke nirmaan kaa rasta nikalegaa
 He expressed apprehension that perhaps Liberhan saheb has not written the report but written it to someone else
 babari vidhwans ke ke baad se uma bharti ke saath aksar ek naare ko joda jaataa he ki ek dhakka or do babari masjid tod do
 On this, Uma says that this slogan was imposed by Sadhvi Ritambhara and not her
 babari vidhwans ke samay ko yaad karte hue uma ne kaha ki bheed dhaanche par chadh gai thi jisaki vajah se wo gir gaya
 Uma also said that all the leaders had appealed to the crowd to get down from the disputed structure but people did not accept their appeal
 uma ne yaad karte hue kaha ki dhaanche ke paas hajaaron logon kii bheed jamaa thi or adwani ji ne unhen bheed ke paas jaakar samajhane ko bhi kaha tha
 He said, 'I gave the right message to the crowd, although the crowd did not listen to me
 ' unhone kaha ki dhaancha girnaa suniyojit nahin tha or yah hindu samaaj kaa kaam tha
 He also said that there is a need to ask the Muslim community on this issue
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is mudde par aam musalmaan tak pahunchane kii bhi jarurat he
 He said that the disputed structure that was demolished was not historical but the place where it was is historic
 uma ne yah bhi kaha ki us samay adwani ji udhaas the or varo khud bhounchakki thi
 Recently there were reports that Uma Bharti might join BJP again
 is par unhon ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke saath unka teen muddo par takaraav he
 Those issues are women's reservation, nuclear agreement and SEZ
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki rajg main shaamil hone ke liye unhone prastaav bheja he
 On Advaniji being called old and changing the leadership in BJP, Uma said that Advani ji is healthy and many of the BJP leaders are more healthy than the leaders
 unhone congress main manmohan singh kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki manmohan singh kii bhi umr ho chuki he lekin unase to congress or rahul gandhi ko koi samasya nahin he

 unhone daawa kiya he ki purv mantri sudhaa shrivastav or vartmaan mantri abdul baari siddiki se bhi rabari devi ne keemtee jameen apane naam karvaa lee thi
 Modi issued a statement on Monday, saying, "lalu Prasad's wife Rabri Devi misused the post during her Chief Ministership
 MLA Co-operative Society (MLA Co-operative) at a market price of Rs
 10 lakhs
 He got former ministers Sudha Srivastava and Abdul Bari Siddiqui named after him
 " unhone daawa kiya he ki varsh 1992-93 main samiti se 5
 59 dismantled land was taken by the allottees for 37 thousand rupees, which even after 10 years, Rabri Devi got it written for only 37 thousand rupees, whereas today the market price of that land will be more than one crore rupees
 bhaajapa netaa ne sawalia lahaze main poocha he ki aakhir lalu ke putr or mantri tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav main aisi koun si khaasiyat he ki purv mantri raghunatha jha or kanti singh jahaan unhen karodon ke jameen-makaan gift kar dete hai, vahiin purv mantri sudhaa shrivastav or abdul baari siddiki jaise log apni lakhon kii jameen mahaj kuch hajaar rupee main rabari devi ko bech dete hai? modi pehle bhi vidhayak sahakaari samiti main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue aavantiyon kii suchi jari karne kii maang kar chuke hai
 The comments unhone sawaal uthaaya ki lalu prasad ke kareebi or samiti ke adhyaksh jaiprakash narayan yadav or sachiv bholaa yadav ne ab tak aavantiyon kii suchi saarvajanik kar yah kyon nahin bataa rahe hai ki kin aavantiyon ko ek se adhik plot aavantit kiye gaye hai or kisne awasaiya kii jagah vyavsaayik istemaal kiya he? bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki samiti dwaara niyamon kii lagaataar avhelnaa kii ja rahi he, lekin sarkaar girane ke dar se mukhyamantri mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par ise bhang nahin kar rahe hai

 ) modi ne somvaar ko ek bayaan jari kar kaha, "lalu prasad kii patni rabari devi ne apane mukhyamantritv kaal main pad kaa durupyog kar vidhayak sahakaari samiti (emele ko-oparative) kii 10-10 lakh rupee bazaar mulya kii jameen oune-paune keemat par purv mantri sudhaa shrivastav or abdul baari siddiki se apane naam karvaa lee
 "he claimed that 5 from the committee in the year 1992-93
 59 dismil jameen 37 hajaar rupee main aavantiyon ne lee thi, jise 10 varsho ke baad bhi rabari devi ne maatr 37 hajaar rupee main hi likhva liya, jabaki aaj us jameen kii bazaar keemat ek karod rupee se zyada hogi
 The BJP leader has asked in question that what is so special between Lalu's son and ministers Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav, where former ministers Raghunath Jha and Kanti Singh gift them land and houses worth crores, while former minister Sudha Do people like Srivastava and Abdul Bari Siddiqui sell their land worth millions to Rabri Devi for a few thousand rupees?

 saal 2008 main 'rock on' or 2013 main 'kaai po che' jaisi filmein dene vaale abhishek kapur ishk ke is mausam main uljhi hui prem kahani 'fitur' ke saath aae hai
 The film is based on Charles Dickens novel 'great Expectations'
 lekin film ko kashmir kii prishthbhumi main rachaa gaya he or film main dikhaaya gaya kashmir vaaki majaboor karata he ki bag pack karo or dharti kii is jananath ko dekhne ke liye nikal pado
 The story of the film is full of ups and downs, but not in a very new way
 film main begum hazrat ke kirdaar main tabboo vaaki anya sitaron par baari padati hai
 After watching the entire film, it seems that Abhishek should have done a little more work on the story, because sometimes when the story becomes very interesting, sometimes it seems very natural and drawn
 jis vajah se film kaa flo baadhit hota he
 Do not fall in love with anyone else by watching this film, you will definitely fall in love with Kashmir
 kahani main kitna damayah kahani kashmir ke hunarmand bachche aditya roy kapur kii he
 She meets Katrina Kaif of childhood and through her with Ammi Tabu
 is tarah ek kashmir ke sidhe-sade ladke ke dimag main bam-sa fatataa he or vah katrina ke fitur main dub jaataa he

 The story then comes to Kashmir via Delhi to Delhi and Delhi to London
 film ke hero-heroin ko lagata he ki yah unka'fitur'he, lekin vah to kisi or ke hi fitur ko ji rahe hote hai
 The thing that engages in the heart of the entire love story is the beauty of Kashmir
 chaahe vah barf girte hue najaare hon yaa begum hazrat kaa bangala yaa phir shikare par jivan
 Everything starts tying you up, there is romanticism in the whole atmosphere, if there is a shortage, then you have to get inside this romantic story
 star apilis film kii jaan do chijen hai- ek kashmir or duusari tabboo
 The shades that Tabu has put in the role of Begum Hazrat are awesome
 pehle is role ke liye rekha ko chunaa gaya tha
 But Tabu later played this character
 vaaki unhone nibhaayaa nahin balki us kirdaar ko screen par jinda kar diya he
 Tabu's 'fitoor' speaks headlong throughout the film
 jahaan tak baat aditya roy kapur kii he to bachapan ke aditya roy kapur kii kashmiri boli bahut hi pyaari he
 The first half hour of the film takes you to a different world
 lekinaditya roy kapoor role main jaan daalane kii koshish kii he
 But everyone's axis is Tabu, and you will know this only by watching the film
 film main katrina caff jab safed kapadon main himpat ke bich aditya se milane aati hai to vah kamaal he
 However his chemistry with Aditya does not produce 'fitoor'
 phir katrina kii dialog delivery main bhi kashish or ishk kaa junun bhi had se gujarata nahin he
 Ajay Devgan is also worth watching

 After voting in Ahmedabad, Narendra Modi took a selfie on the lines of millions of youth
 selfi, yani mobile se apni hi photo kheenchna or phir ise soshal media jaise twitor yaa fasebuk par daalana
 It has become the most popular in this election
 matdaan ke prati logon main jaagrukta or unhen protsaahan dene ke liye kuch bade akhbaaron or media channelon ne bhi vot daalane ke baad selfi lene ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 Photographs of thousands of people who have drawn themselves after casting their votes are also being shown in the mainstream media
 soshal media par to aisi selfi kii baadh ai hui he
 There are a lot of leaders on social media, but there is no such leader, who not only took a selfie after showing his finger and election symbol with indelible ink after casting his vote in this way, but he immediately got his account (@narendramodi ) Also tweeted
 dekhte hi dekhte # selfiewithmodi twitor par top trend ban gaya
 With this hash tag thousands of people are constantly tweeting and welcoming Modi's move
 khud modi ne jis twit ke jariye apana selfi daalaa, use yah lekh likhte vakt tak 1500 baar ritvit kiya ja chukaa he or 1000 logon ne fevorett kiya he
 In this election, Narendra Modi has used social media as a huge weapon of publicity
 balki vah sambhawatah aise pehle netaa hai, jinhone prachaar abhiyaan main soshal media ke mahatv ko samajha
 During his Sadbhavna Mission in 2011, he campaigned separately through Facebook and Twitter
 party kii andruni baithkon main bhi vah party netaaon ko soshal media ke zyada se zyada istemaal ke liye kehete rahe
 In the last two assembly elections in Gujarat, Modi used social media fiercely
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main soshal media ke liye unki apni ek alag team he, jo top trend se lekar virodhiyon ke khilaaf chalane vaale trend or twits par nazar rakhti he
 These are reviewed every day and strategies are formulated according to major issues
 aae-din virodhiyon se twitor par yuddh chhidata he or muqabla is baat par hota he ki koun sa trend top par rahegaa
 On the lines of Modi, many big leaders of BJP have now openly come on social media
 twitor par narendra modi ko 38 lakh se zyaada log follow kar rahe hai, jo bharat main kisi bhi shakhsiyat main sabase zyada he
 While his page on Facebook has been liked by more than 10 million people
 iske alaava google hangout or fasebuk ke saath kaarykram kar bhi modi soshal media ke jariye logon tak pahunche hai
 Apart from this, Modi also blogging regularly
 utyub par bhi narendra modi ke bhaashanon ke video badi sankhya main dekhe jate hai
 In contrast, Rahul Gandhi is neither on Twitter nor Facebook
 congress party soshal media par der se sakriy hui
 Today the party has its own Twitter account
 saath hi congress ke kai bade netaa bhi twitor or fasebuk ke jariye soshal media par sakriy hai
 Whereas if someone has made the best use of social media like Modi, it is Aam Aadmi Party and its leader Arvind Kejriwal
 soshal media par kejariwal behad sakriy hai or yah unke liye apane kaaryakartaaon se judane kaa shashakt madhyam he
 In the social media trend, Kejriwal appears to be competing with Modi and Rahul Gandhi
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 desh kaa pehla aisa bada chunaav hone ja rahaa he, jisamen soshal media ne badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 a recent study said that there are around 160 Lok Sabha seats where social media is in a position to influence the results
 is baar 10 karod nae matadaata jude hai, jinamein ek bada hissaa soshal media par sakriy he
 It is clear that all political parties, including Modi, are eyeing them
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi(rahul Gandhi) ne phir pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa kiya he
 He raised two questions in the case of CBI chief Alok Verma and while targeting himself, targeted the Prime Minister
 sibiai main pichley saal hue vivaad ke baad sarkaar ne alok verma ko chuttee par bhej diya tha

 haal main supreme court ne alok verma ko sibiai diarector ke rup main kuch sharton ke adheen kaam karne kii manjuuri di
 After which he has again taken charge at CBI headquarters

 Why is the PM in such a tearing hurry to sack the CBI Chief? 2
 Why will he not allow the CBI Chief to present his case in front of the selection committee? Answer: RAFALE Social activist Anna Hazare has once again announced to agitate
 vah buudhvaar ko subah 10 baje maharashtra ke ahamed nagar jile sthit apane gaanv ralegan siddhi main anshan par baithenge
 He targeted the central government on Tuesday and said that it has been 5 years since the Lokpal Act was made and the Narendra Modi government continued to make excuses for five years
 unhone kaha, 'narendra modi sarkaar ke dil main agar hota to kya isamen 5 saal laganaa jaruri tha?'anna ne kaha ki, 'ye meraa anshan kisi vyakti, paksh or party ke khilaaf main nahin he
 i have been agitating again and again for the betterment of society and country, this is the same type of movement
 ' bataa den ki 2011-12 main anna hajaare ke netritv main dilli ke ramlila maidan par tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ke khilaaf bada andolan hua tha
 It is also special that many faces who were involved in that movement have now come into politics
 arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ban chuke hai, kiran bedi puducheri kii rajyapal niyukt ho chuki hai
 At the same time, Anna is going to sit on hunger strike once again
 is baar andolan kaa sthaan dilli na hokar anna kaa apana gaanv ralegan siddhi hi he
 Where did the Lokpal fight reach? The Lokpal Bill was passed in 2013 after a major movement in the country after a long five-year long exercise
 lekin ab tak lokapal niyukt nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The bill passed under the Congress-led UPA government has not yet taken concrete shape
 jabaki maujuuda sarkaar kaa bhi paanch varsh kaa kaarykaal lagbhag khatm hone vaala he
 The case hangs in the Supreme Court
 is maamle kii sunwaayee koi dedh maheene ke liye tal gai he
 But the way in which the matter is currently being postponed, nothing can be said with certainty as to how the government will be able to proceed by electing it in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 magar yah sawaal mauju bana rahegaa ki nai sarkaar main bhi lokapal kii niyukti mumkin hogi yaa nahin?baharhaal bataa den ki lokapal kii niyukti ko lekar gat guuruuvaar ko sarvocch nyaayalay ne agali sunwaayee ke liye 7 march kii tithi mukarr kii he
 Also, the apex court has asked the government to report the efforts made for the appointment of Lokpal
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne lokapal jaanch samiti ko ye bhi nirdesh diya he ki vah lokapal or uske sadasyon ke naamon kaa chayan karne kaa kaam farvari ke ant tak puraa kar le
 Also make a panel of names for consideration of the selection committee
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne centre ko search cameti ke liye aavashyak buniyadi dhaancha muhaiyaa karne ke liye bhi kaha he
 What is the status of Lokpal at the moment? Let us know that no meeting has been held since the committee was formed to search for Lokpal
 pichley saal sitambar main lokapal kii niyukti ke liye search cameti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Earlier, on January 4, the Supreme Court had directed the central government to submit an affidavit on all the efforts taken in relation to the Lokpal search committee from September 2018 till now
 jisamen yah bataaya jaae ki samiti gathit karne ke liye kya-kya kadam uthaae gaye
 The top court sought the affidavit following the Attorney General's reply, stating that since September 2018, several attempts have been made to constitute the committee
 kyon lokapal jaruri he?paarit vidheyak ke mutabik lokapal ke paas chaparasi se lekar pradhanmantri tak kisi bhi janasevak ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat kii sunwaayee kaa adhikaar he
 Even if he is a minister, government officer, panchayat member, etc
 is posted in any post
 lokapal jaanch ke baad in sabhi kii sampatti ko kurk bhi kar saktaa he
 Under special circumstances, the Lokpal also has the right to hold a court hearing against a man and impose a fine of up to Rs 2 lakh
 haalanki bhartiya sena lokapal ke daayre se baahar he
 The Lokpal bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 13 December 2013
 chaar din baad 17 disambar 2013 ko yah vidheyak rajyasabha se paas ho gaya tha
 The next day, on 18 December 2013, the bill was also passed by the Lok Sabha

 The apprehension of corruption corruption was bolstered when the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audited the books of accounts of the Haj Committee from March 31, 2005 to March 31, 2012, and found no such record with the committee

 The allegations of collusion are bolstered by the fact that in 2012, the Jadda-based Consul General spent 6,50,000 riyals on the traveling allowance of Haj Committee members, which amounted to about one crore in Indian currency

 According to Ahmed, chairman of the Haj Committee from 1999 to 2006, the rent of buildings in mecca-medina was not increased even once in eight years during his tenure, but now it has tripled in six years

In his report Hashmat Parkar, the air charter in-charge of the Haj Committee, has confessed in front of the committee that out of the 12 places allotted to Air India, 8 places are subcontracted
 Contracts were given, of which Avian Air of France for the passengers of Gaya, Dynamic Airways of America for Guwahati and Aurangabad and White Air of Portugal were used for the passengers of Mangalore, Goa, Ranchi, Indore and Bhopal

 pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara khud ko uttar pradesh kaa dattak putr bataae jane vaale bayaan par argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne kadi tippanee kii he
 In a controversial statement, Lalu raised the question that if Uttar Pradesh has adopted Narendra Modi, then Prime Minister Modi should tell who his father is and what his name is? Lalu Prasad said when Uttar Pradesh adopted Modi took? Modi is saying that Uttar Pradesh has adopted him, then tell who his father is and what his name is? Modi ties anything with any state for votes
 'lalu ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha lalu kii raajnneeti hameshaa gaali-galoch kii bhashaa vaali rahi he
 Sushil Modi said that the use of abusive language is in the culture of Lalu, which his family is also promoting

" yah baat sach he ki janata hi maai-baap hoti he
 The manner in which Lalu has used the language for the Prime Minister, the people of Uttar Pradesh will answer this in the elections

 Maybe that's why he doesn't want to work with Anushka

 National Democratic Party (RLP) convenor Hanuman Beniwal will contest the election in alliance
 party pradesh kii sabhi 25 loksabhaa seat par chunaav ladegi
 For this, it will form a 'third Front' in alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Marxist Communist Party (CPI) and the Tribal Party of India (BTP)
 beniwal ne jaipur main press conference main kaha ki rajasthan main loksabhaa chunaav main ‘tisare morche’ kaa gathan kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen ham bispi, sipiai or bitipi ke saath milakar 25 siton par saajha ummidavaar utaarenge
 It is worth noting that in the last assembly election, Hanuman Beniwal won the second position by winning 3 seats
 to vahiin 15 se 20 siton par bijepi or congress ke ummidavaaron kaa khel bigaada tha
 The Tribal Party of India has also won 3 seats in the assembly elections while the BSP has won 6 seats

 com / yvdwc9pdne colombo test main bharat ne srilanka ke saamne 386 ran kii chunauti rakh di he
 
 
 In such a situation, Team India seems to be in a position to win the series after a long wait of 22 years
 
 
 or yah kamaal dikhaane ke liye team india ke gendbaajon ko paanchaven din apana puraa damakham jhonknaa hoga
 In the Colombo Test, Sri Lankan batsmen will now have to stick to the remaining wicket in the remaining session on Monday and on Tuesday to save the Test
 jis tarah se bhartiya gendbaajon ke saamne srilanka ne pehali pari main 47 ran ke bheetar 6 wicket ganvaa die the, use dekhte hue srilanka ke liye test bachaana mushkil dikh rahaa he
 Ishant Sharma proved to be a puzzle in the first innings for the Sri Lankan batsmen
 15 overon kii gendbaaji main eshanth ne paanch wicket chatkaaye or ab unki najar duusari pari kii gendbaaji par hogi
 If Ishant did not let Sri Lanka's opening batsmen freeze, then victory would be easy for India
 is bharose kii sabase badi vajah bhartiya gendbaaji akraman main aar aswin or amit mishra kii maujuudagi he
 These two are among the most successful bowlers of India in this series
 aswin ko tisare test kii pehali pari main bhale koi wicket nahin mila ho, lekin ve pehle do test maichon main 17 wicket jhatak chuke hai
 Especially Sri Lankan left-handed batsmen have no answer to Ashwin's off-spin and googly
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Amit Mishra has also taken 14 wickets in this series so far
 jaahir he in donon kii phiraki ke saamne srilankai ballebaajon ke liye din bhar wicket par tik paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Anyway, Colombo's pitch is going to help the spinners on the last day
 aise main team india 22 saal baad srilankai jameen par itihaas rachane ke kareeb he
 To win the Test series, only the last day Indian bowlers have to bowl on the line length
 viraat kohli ke liye test captain ke taur yah kaamyaab shuruyaat hogi
 They are on the verge of winning Team India in their first major series
 colombo test main ab srilanka ke ballebaajon ko test bachaane ke liye somvaar ko bache hue satr main or mangalvaar ko puure wicket par tikna hoga
 Looking at the way Sri Lanka lost 6 wickets within 47 runs in the first innings in front of Indian bowlers, it is difficult for Sri Lanka to save the Test
 srilankai ballebaajon ke liye pehali pari main eshanth sharma paheli sabit hue
 Ishant took five wickets in 15 overs bowling and now he will be eyeing the second innings bowling
 agar eshanth ne srilanka ke shuruaati ballebaajon ko jamane nahin diya, to phir bharat ke liye jeet aasaan ho jaaegi
 The biggest reason for this belief is the presence of r Ashwin and Amit Mishra in the Indian bowling attack
 ye donon is siries main bharat ke sabase kaamyaab gendbaajon main shaamil hai
 Ashwin may not have got any wickets in the first innings of the third Test, but he has taken 17 wickets in the first two Tests
 khaskar srilanka ke baayen haath ke ballebaajon ke paas aswin kii of spin or gugali kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 The comments vahiin duusari ore amit mishra bhi ab tak is siries main 14 wicket jhatak chuke hai
 Obviously, it will not be easy for the Sri Lankan batsmen to stay on the wicket throughout the day in front of these two sides
 vaise bhi colombo kii pich aakhri din spinneron ko madad dene vaali he
 In such a situation, Team India is close to making history on Sri Lankan land after 22 years
 test siries jeetne ke liye keval aakhri din bhartiya gendbaajon ko line length par gendbaaji kerani he
 It will be a successful debut for Virat Kohli as Test captain

 The Lok Sabha on Thursday finally passed the historic Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017 after a long debate
 loksabhaa main yah bill paas hote hi muslim mahilaon ke chehre khil uthe
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also expressed happiness at thumping his desk
 guuruuvaar ko deshbhar kii nigahen sadan kii kaarywahi par gadi raheen or kareeb paanch ghante kii bahes ke baad yah bill paas ho gaya
 The reason for this is that this bill is related to the fate and snapping of the nine crore Muslim women of the country
 yah aabaadi britain kii jansankhya se bhi zyada he
 About four months ago, a bench of five judges of the Supreme Court, by majority, declared three divorces unconstitutional
 saath hi sarkaar se maamle main kanoon banane ko kaha tha
 On Thursday, the Central Government first introduced the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017 in the Lok Sabha
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bill pesh karte hue kaha ki aaj kaa din aitihaasik he
 The Modi government has brought this bill to provide Muslim women their rights and justice
 unhone kaha ki is bill kaa dharm se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The government has not brought three divorce bills to interfere with the Sharia
 iskaa makasad sirf teen talaak ko rokna he
 In many Muslim countries including Pakistan, triple talaq is prohibited
 is dauraan ravishankar prasad ne congress party ko bhi nishane par liya
 He creates strange confusion in the tone of the Congress party
 congress ek ore kahati he ki wo bill kaa samarthan kar rahi he, to duusari ore kintu or parantu kar rahi he, jo chalane vaala nahin he
 He said that this bill should not be weighed on the scales of politics or religion
 loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan RJD, BJD or sapa samet kai vipakshi partiyon ne is bill kaa virodh kiya
 These parties have rejected the provision of punishment in the bill as wrong and strongly opposed it
 loksabhaa main bill par bahes kaa mudda hi sajaa kaa praavdhaan rahaa
 This was followed by voting on the amendment proposals introduced by the opposition parties on the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017
 haalanki voting ke dauraan sabhi sanshodhan prastaav gir gaye or loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne is bill ke paas hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 During this time the Congress said that only the Modi government cannot take credit for passing this bill
 congress samet kisi bhi vipakshi dal ne is bill kaa virodh nahin kiya
 The Congress had talked of sending the bill only to the standing committee
 ovaisi ke teen sanshodhan prastaav samet sabhi prastaav khaarijaloksabhaa main muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017par lambii bahes ke baad sanshodhan prastaavon par voting hui
 All amendment proposals submitted by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on this bill were completely rejected
 ovaisi ke pehle sanshodhan prastaav ke paksh main sirf do vot pade, jabaki virodh main 241 sadasyon ne vot kiya
 In addition, 242 members voted against Owaisi's Second Amendment proposal, while 2 votes were cast in favor
 zyada musalamaanon ko jail main daalane ke liye banaaya ja rahaa kanoonh ovaisiloksabhaa main teen talaak bill par bahes ke dauraan AIMIM pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne modi sarkaar par kai aarope lagaae
 He said that through this bill, the Modi government is not only interfering in personal law, but was dreaming of putting more and more Muslims in jail
 ovaisi ne kaha ki supreme court ne sirf teen talaak hi nahin, balki sabhi tarah ke talaak ko khatm karne kii baat kahi thi
 He said that there is no penal code for divorce in any Muslim country
 iske tahat sajaa kaa praavdhaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The husband cannot be forced to fulfill all the needs of Bibi
 3 saal kii sajaa par dikhaa jabardast takaravloksabhaa main teen talaak bill ke tahat teen saal kii sajaa ke praavdhaan ko lekar sabase zyada takaraav dikhaa
 Most of the opposition parties strongly opposed this
 sadan main bahes ke dauraan RJD, BJD or sapa samet kai vipakshi partiyon ne is bill ke tahat teen saal kii sajaa ke praavdhaan par apana virodh darj karaayaa
 They said that the Modi government is passing this bill in a hurry
 isamen sajaa kaa praavdhaan karnaa puri tarah se galata he
 Forcing Muslim men, not Islam, is in danger: Speaking in Akbarlok Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar said that the triple talaq bill does not endanger Islam but force Muslim men
 baaki kuch bhi khatre main nahin he
 Explaining Sharia, he said that Sharia does not mean law, but the way
 unhone kaha ki shariya kaa matlab rasta dikhaanaa he
 Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar also lashed out at the All India Muslim Personal Law Board
 is board se salaah mashvira karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki aakhir muslim personal lau board kii vishwasaneeyata hi kya he? aakhir isko kisne banaaya he? kya is board ke sadsy chunakar aate hai? agar wo janata se chunakar nahin aate hai, to unako maamle main shaamil kyon kiya jaae?aal india muslim personal lau board ne kiya virodevahin aal india muslim personal lau board ne loksabhaa main teen talaak ke khilaaf vidheyak paarit kiye jane kii ninda karte hue kaha ki vah is vidheyak main sanshodhan karaane yaa use radd karaane ke liye sabhi loktantric tareeke apnayega
 Board spokesperson Maulana Khalilurrahman Sajjad Nomani says that the board is very sorry that the bill relating to triple talaq was introduced in such a hurry
 is jaldbaaji kii koi vajah samaj main nahin aati
 What will the bill be like? Modi government has brought this bill in the name of 'muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017'
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim man gives three divorces to his wife, it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak, vah chahen maukhik ho yaa likhit ho or yaa phir massej ke jariye ho, avaidh hoga
 Whoever gives three divorces can be punished and fined for three years, ie, giving three divorces will be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh
 aisa he prastaavit bill- ek saath teen baar talaak (bolkar, likhakar yaa email, esemes or whatsap jaise electronic madhyam se) kahana gaiyrkanoonee hog- aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 - yah kanoon sirf 'talaak e biddat' yani ek saath teen baar talaak bolne par lagu hoga
 - The victim of divorce can appeal to the Magistrate seeking alimony for himself and minor children
 - peedit mahila magistrate se naaballig bacchon ke sangrakshan kaa bhi anurodh kar sakati he
 The magistrate will take a final decision on the issue
 - yah prastaavit kanoon jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar puure desh main lagu hoga he
 Janmashtami 2019: Krishna Janmashtami 2019 is falling two days this time
 hindu panchang ke anusaar krishna janmashtami bhadrapada maah ke krishna paksh kii ashtami tithi yani ki aathven din manaai jaati he
 According to the Gregorian calendar, Krishna Janmashtami falls every year in the month of August or September
 tithi ke hisaab se janmashtami 23 agast ko manaai jaaegi
 At the same time, people who give priority to Rohini Nakshatra can celebrate Janmashtami on August 24
 is maukey ham aapako bataaenge ki ve koun hai, jo shri krishna (lord Krishna) ke shatru hai
 Lord Krishna killed many demons like Tadka, Putana, Shaktasura, Kalia and Narakasura
 in asuron se krishna kii shatruta nahin thi, lekin unke dushmano ne unhen bheja
 At the same time, there were some people who had direct enmity with Krishna
 in shatruon main shrikrishna kaa mamaa kansa bhi shaamil tha
 Here we are telling about the five great enemies of Aapamo Shri Krishna: The battle of King Jarasandha and Bhima in the arena continued continuously for 13 days from Karthik Krishna Pratipada
 14wein din shrikrishna ne ek tinke ko bich main se todakar uske donon bhaag ko vipareet disha main phenk diya
 Bhima understood this gesture of Shri Krishna and he did it there
 unhone jaraasandh ko dophaad kar uske ek faad ko duusare faad kii ore tathaa duusare faad ko pehle faad kii disha main phenk diya
 In this way, Jarasandha came to an end, because the two pieces did not join due to being thrown in the opposite direction
 jharkhand main bijepi gathbandhan ko purna bahumat milane ke baad bihar main janata dal united, rashtriya janata dal or congress party kaa saath aana tay mana ja rahaa he
 Chances have increased that the three parties together formed a grand alliance to stop the bjp's Vijay Rath in Bihar
 jharkhand main bijepi kii sarkaar bananaa koi khabar nahin: nitishaiske sanket sabase pehle bihar ke mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ne die
 He admitted that it was a big mistake for the secular parties not to form an alliance before the election
 aapako bataa den ki jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav main argedy or jediu ek bhi seat jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 At the same time, the Congress had to be satisfied with only 6 seats
 maanjhi ne kaha, 'hamaari galatiyon ke kaaran bijepi ko phayda hua he
 If we had formed an alliance, the BJP would have been reduced to half of the existing seats won
 'maanjhi ke in daavon se bihar ke purv siem nitish kumaar bhi sahamat hai
 He said, 'if the Grand Alliance was formed, the political atmosphere of Jharkhand would have been different
 ' vaise nitish kaa maananaa he ki vipaksh ke bante hone ke baavjood bhi bijepi ne ummid se kam siten jiti hai
 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav said that BJP benefited from the sharing of secular votes
 agar argedy or jharkhand mukti morcha ke bich bhi gathbandhan ho jaataa to bijepi haar jaati
 They will not repeat such mistake in Bihar assembly elections
 bihar pradesh congress kamity ke adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne kaha ki anti bijepi ko voton ko bantane se rokane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Let us tell you that in the 2009 Jharkhand Assembly elections, RJD got 5 seats, JDU got 2 seats and Congress got 14 seats
 narendra modi ke kaarykaal main do baar bhartiya sena ne pakistan kii seemaa main ghuskar strike kii he

 In Mathura, this rate is fixed at Rs 300, which was being demanded for several days
 mathura main andolan kareeb 15 din pehle tab shuru hua, jab noida ke kisaanon ke liye zamin kaa bhav 100 rupee badha diya gaya
 The farmers demanded that their compensation should also be increased because the land of Mathura is more fertile than Noida

 Not only this, he has also shown speed with swing

 Now why this player is not kept in India's playing eleven
 iskaa matlab to saaf he ki bhartiya team yaa to vaaki bahut majboot he yaa phir bhubaneshwar bahut analki
 But the truth is that this swing of Bhubaneswar was lost somewhere
 jo mehnat or abhyaas ke baad waapas lauti he, jisase bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni khaasaa khush hai
 Dhoni says that Bhubaneswar is a hardworking bowler, he works hard in nets and gym
 isse unki raftaar badi he lekin aap raftaar ke liye apni swing ko nahin ganvaa sakate, jo hamaare liye ek acchhee baat he

 It is clear that even if Shami does not fit, India's victory campaign will not have much effect during Bhubaneswar
 yahi nahin swing ke saath unhone raftaar bhi dikhaai he
 He bowled at a speed of around 140 kmph
 ab kyon is khilaadi bharat kii plaing ilevan main nahin rakhaa jaataa
 This means that the Indian team is either really strong or Bhubaneswar is very unlucky
 lekin sach yah he ki bhubaneshwar kii ye swing kahin kho gai thi
 Who has returned after hard work and practice, making Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni very happy
 dhoni kehete hai ki bhubaneshwar ek mehnatee gendbaaz hai, wo nets or gym main kaafii mehnat karte hai
 This has increased their speed but you cannot lose your swing for speed, which is a good thing for us
 ek jagah par nirantar gendbaazi karne main wo maahir hai
 Dhoni said that Bhuvi got a good break and has taken advantage of it and we have a bowler ready to take his place in case Shami is not fit
 bhubaneshwar kii 24 main se 20 gendon par koi ran nahin ban sakaa he

 They say that earlier there were more than fifty houses at this place and children used to play there
 baadh gharon or sadakon ko tinke ke peeche baha le gaye
 The belongings of people's homes are now lying on the banks of this broken road and the village submerged by the disaster
 ve kehete hai ki ab aisa lagata he jaise bhayaavah samandar or ret ke bade-bade tile bache hon
 Where the gallop used to run, life is now on the boat

 On July 10, the water of the NHPC dam in Arunachal and the rising water level of the Lohit River caused significant damage to life and property here
 majuli ke upayukta pallav jha kehete hai ki ki baadh se lagbhag 75 hajaar log prabhavit hue hai or saikadon ghar pani main dub gaye hai
 The disaster also took a 13-month-old baby
 yahaan majuli gaanv har saal baadh kii bhayavahata se jujhataa he
 People have settled on the other side of the road but there is no electricity

 donon deshon ke bich behad tanaavpurn hai rishtebharat kii maang ko thukraata rahaa pakistanmumbai main hue aatanki hamale (26 / 11) ko 11 baras ho gaye hai, lekin aaj bhi is hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ko sajaa nahin mil saki he
 The relationship between the two countries has remained extremely tense since this attack
 bharat paak se lagaataar said par karrwai kii maang karata rahaa he, lekin paak ise sabooton ke naam par thukraata rahaa he
 At least 166 people were killed and more than 300 were seriously injured in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack on 26 November
 pakistan ko chahie thos sabutabharat kaa kahana he ki lashkar-e-taiyyaba (eliti) or jamaat-ud-daawa (jeyudi) kaa netaa hafiz said is hamale kaa mastermind he or pakistan se uske kiye kii sajaa die jane kii maang karata rahaa he
 However, Pakistan, on the other hand, says that Hafiz Saeed's role in this terror attack has not been proved nor can it be proved in court, so he cannot be held responsible for being a criminal
 philhal hafiz said mani londring or teror fading ke aarope main lahore kii ek jail main kaid he, lekin us par 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamalon se sambandhit koi maamla darj nahin hua he
 Today 11 years have passed since this terrorist incident and even today it remains the main issue of dispute, rivalry and protest between the two sides
 lahore ke anti teror court main kesamumbai aatanki hamale se jude ek maamle kii sunwaayee lahore ke anti teror court main chal rahi he, jabaki jaanch dal hafiz said ke khilaaf karrwai ke koi bhi thos saboot pesh karne main naakaam rahaa he
 India believes that the Government of Pakistan and the Pak Army support Hafiz Saeed and that is why he is roaming free in this matter
 pakistan bharat ke daawey ko khaarij karata he or us par karrwai karne ke liye bharat se thos saboot kii maang karata he
 India has stated that in 2008, at least 10 Pakistan-sponsored terrorists had entered Mumbai by sea through planned and full preparations to carry out the attacks
 unka lakshya desh kii aarthik rajdhani ke kai pramukh ilaakon ko nishaanaa bananaa tha
 The terrorists targeted Mumbai's famous Taj Hotel, Oberoi Trident, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, Nariman House and other major sites
 kasaab ko mili faansibharat kaa yah bhi daawa he ki yeatankwadeelashkar-e-taiyyaba ke the or hafiz said ke netritv vaale sanghathan ne is hamale kii sari sajeesh rachi or puri taiyaari ko anjaam diya
 Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist caught alive among 10 terrorists, was sentenced to death in November 2012
 bharat ne daawa kiya ki ajmal kasaab pakistani naagarik tha, jabaki pakistan ne bharat ke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya
 Pakistan says that it is indeed an Indian citizen and India has conspired to defame Pakistan
 aaj bhi mumbai aatanki hamale ko lekar bharat-pakistan ke bich tarkon kaa daur jari he

 People's lifestyle is also changing rapidly with changing times
 pehle jahaan log subah jaldi uthte the or raat ko jaldi sote the
 At the same time, it has become a trend to sleep and eat late in the modern lifestyle
 aajkal adhiktar log der raat tak jaagate hai or kuch na kuch khate rahete hai
 But late night eating habits severely damage health

 Eating late at night can cause health damage - 1
 sone main pareshaani hoti he-der raat main khaane se sharir kii sleep cycle disturb hoti he
 According to a report in the year 2015, consuming snacks late at night not only disrupts sleep but also causes nightmares while sleeping due to gastric problems
 2
 Digestion is bad - if you have a burning or gas problem, change your meal time
 der raat khaaya gaya khaanaa thik tarah se diguest nahin ho paata he, jis kaaran logon ko gas kii samasya sataati he
 Therefore, people are often advised to take a walk after dinner, so that the food is properly digested
 3
 Weight gain - eating late at night also affects the body's circadian clock
 sarkadian clock ke bigadane se neend main to baadha aati hi he saath hi sharir main hormones kaa santulan bhi bighad jaataa he
 This causes people to gain weight
 bataa den, raat ke samay sharir kaa metabolism din ke mukaable kamjor hota he, jis kaaran raat ke samay zyada calories bern nahin ho paati hai

 blad pressure badhata he-anheldi lifestil follow karne se dil kii beemaari or diabetes kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Several studies report that eating late at night increases blood pressure and increases blood sugar levels, which can prove dangerous for people

 The Gujarat government has again sought more time from the central government to implement the Food Security Act
 rajya sarkaar ne kaha he ki yah kanoon lagu karne ke liye dedline badhaai jaani chahie, lekin is mudde par gujarat main raajnneeti garmaane lagi he
 Ahmed Patel, senior Congress leader and political adviser to Sonia Gandhi, has written a letter to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel on this issue
 is chitthee main unhone gujarat ke vikaas model par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki gujarat sarkaar garibon ke liye yah yojana lagu karne main puri tarah se vifal rahi he
 The comments unhone aarope lagaaya ki rajya sarkaar apni publicity karne main karodon rupee kharch kar rahi he, lekin aisi ahm yojana lagu karne main lagaataar vifal ho rahi he
 Whereas states like Bihar with more population than Gujarat have implemented it
 is mudde par gujarat sarkaar chup he
 Government spokesman Nitin Patel said that he has not received the letter yet, only when he gets it will he talk on it, but he claimed that the state government is doing good work
 lekin kai swayamsevi sanghathan bhi sarkaar ke is deele ravaiye par sawaal uthaate rahe hai
 Especially when many worrying facts about malnutrition are coming to light in the state
 sarkaar ke apane hi prachaar ko maane, to rajya main kareeb 41 lakh garibi rekha ke neeche ke parivaar hai yani bahut badi sankhya main rajya main garib hai or unhen khaadya suraksha kii darkaar he
 Recently, an international magazine like Economist also had a report on malnutrition in India and claimed that Gujarat is one of the worst states in the country in terms of malnutrition
 aise main hemanth shah jaise aarthik vishleshak bhi ye aarope laga rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar audyogic nivesh ko jitani praathamikta detii he, utani khaadya suraksha jaise ahm masale ko nahin, jo gujarat model kii naakaamiyabi he
 He alleged that the state government is spending crores of rupees to do its publicity, but is continuously failing to implement such important scheme
 jabaki gujarat se zyada jansankhya vaale bihar jaise rajyon ne ise lagu kar diya he
 The Gujarat government is silent on this issue
 sarkaar ke pravaktaa nitin patel ne bataaya ki unhen abhi chitthee nahin mili he, jab milegi tabhi wo is par baat karenge, lekin unhone daawa kiya ki rajya sarkaar acha kaam kar rahi he
 But many voluntary organizations have also been questioning this loose attitude of the government
 khaskar tab jab rajya main kuposhan ko lekar kai chintajanak tathy saamne aa rahe hai
 If we follow the government's own propaganda, there are about 41 lakh families below the poverty line in the state, that is a large number of poor people in the state and they need food security
 haal hi main iconomist jaisi antarrashtriya patrika main bhi bharat main kuposhan par ek report ai thi or daawa kiya gaya tha ki kuposhan ke maamle main gujarat puure desh main sabase behaal rajyon main se ek he
 In such a situation, economic analysts like Hemant Shah are also alleging that the state government gives priority to industrial investment, not the important issue like food security, which is a failure of the Gujarat model
