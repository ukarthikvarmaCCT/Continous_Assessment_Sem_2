desh ke pratishthit praudyogiki santhaan iaiti kii pravesh pariksha main mahatvapurn badlaav kiye gayi hai
 Now, in deciding the ranking of the student in the entrance examination to be held from 2017, the qualification of 40 percent of the numbers brought in his 12th examination will be abolished
 lekin is saal 2016 main ye pariksha pichley saal ke niyamon ke tahat hi hogi
 At the time of the UPA government, these rules were made that any student will have 40 percent weightage of 12th
 yani uski ranking tay karne main 40 pratishat role 12veen ke numberon kaa hoga
 Now it has been abolished but the student has to bring the 75 percentile number in class 12th
 essi / asti category ke chaatro ko 65 pratishat number laana anivaary hoga
 The comments upie-2 ke vakt shiksha mantri rahe kapil sibabl in badlaavon ko ye kahkar laaye ki wo koching sansthaanon par chaatra kii nirbharta ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 However, many boards of states also opposed this system, because it is not possible for students in the states to bring the number like CBSE board
 is lihaaj se ab naye niyamon main 75 pratishat or anusuchit jati ke chaatro ke liye 65 pratishat number laane kii shart kaa bhi virodh ho saktaa he

 Kapil Sibbl, who was the Education Minister during UPA-2, brought these changes by saying that he wants to end the dependency of the students on the coaching institutes
 haalanki rajyon ke kai board is system kaa virodh bhi karte rahe, kyonki rajyon main chaatro ke liye sibiesai board kii tarah number laana mumkin nahin ho paata
 In this context, now the condition of bringing 75 percent number in the new rules and 65 percent for scheduled caste students can also be opposed
 is lihaaj se ab naye niyamon main 75 pratishat or anusuchit jati ke chaatro ke liye 65 pratishat number laane kii shart kaa bhi virodh ho saktaa he
 Good news for those who have an account with the Employees Provident Fund Planning Organization (EPFO)
 sanghathan ne faisla kiya he ki oktober se sabhi anshadharakon ko kam se kam ek hajaar rupee kii pension di jaaegi
 The Narendra Modi government released its notification on Thursday
 iske tahat ipief ke liye adhiktam vetan seemaa bhi badhaakar 15 hajaar rupee kar di gai he
 These decisions will come into effect from 1 September
 karmchaaree pension yojana 1995 main nunatam pension 1 hajaar rupee karne se 28 lakh pensionbhogiyon ko phayda hoga
 Along with this, raising the salary limit from Rs 6,500 monthly to Rs 15,000 for eligibility to become a shareholder of EPFO will bring 50 lakh more employees in the organized sector under the scheme
 in faislon ke bare main jaankaree dete hue ipiefo ke central provident fund kamishnar keke jalaan ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne vetan seemaa badhaakar 15,000 pratimah kiye jane, ipief-95 ke tahat nunatam masik pension 1,000 rupee or karmchaaree kii ipief jamaa se judi beemaa (idielai) yojana ke tahat adhiktam bimit raashi teen lakh rupee karne kii adhisuchana jari kar di he
 Jalan said, 'now the maximum sum assured under EDLI is 3
 6 lakh rupee ho jaaegi, jisamen adhisuchana ke tahat tay raashi par 20% (60,000 rupee) kaa tadarth laabh bhi shaamil he
 'this means that if the EPFO shareholder dies, his family will get 1 now
 56 lakh rupee kii raashi jagah 3
 6 lakh rupees
 jalaan ne kaha ki nunatam pension, vetan seemaa or idielai sambandhi adhisuchana 1 sitambar se prabhavi hogi
 Thus all those pensioners who are currently getting less than Rs 1,000 per month pension will get at least this amount from October

 Muslim reservation is ending in Maharashtra

 com / 8yq2y0ywad — Karan Johar (@karanjohar) October 11, 2017 Let us first say that Ayan Mukherjee wanted to name the film Dragon
 film par baat karte hue ek intervyuu main ayaan ne kaha tha ki isfantsi adventure trylogisiris main unka superhiro kuch aisi shaktiyaan rakhata he jinka rishta aag se he
 That's why he used to call the film Dragon earlier
 lekin ab iske concept par kaam puraa hone ke baad unhone iskaa tital brahmastra rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 Well, this is the first time that a superhero film has been decided on 3 parts before its launch
 ranbir kapur ne ye kya kah diya ranvir singh ke bare main!pichley kuch samay main silver screen par ranbir kaa craij kam hua he
 His films are not doing anything special at the box office
 unki pichhali relies 'e dil he mushkil' hit sabit hui thi
 But Ranbir is looking for a superhit to bring back his charm
 jagga jasoos bhi flop ho gai thi
 Ranbir and Ayan Mukherjee are very good friends
 isliye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki yah film unki kitni madad karti he
 a new twist in the hrithik-kangna controversy: Ranbir Kapoor did the queen for 'relationship', while every film of Alia Bhatt is proving to be a box office hit
 vah top heroinon main shumaar hai
 His previous release 'badrinath Ki Dulhania' entered the 100 crore club

 dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ke janalokapal bill kaa mudda garmata ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung regarding the Jan Lokpal bill
 kejariwal ne likhaa he ki jab jan lokapal bill bheja hi nahin gaya, to kis bill par aapane raay maangi he
 Kejriwal has written, when you do not have the draft of the bill, on which bill you sought opinion from the Solicitor General
 unhone likhaa he ki aapane samvidhan raksha kii shapath lee he, hamen ummid he ki aap samvidhan kii raksha karenge
 He has also written that the Lieutenant Governor does not belong to any particular party
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri manish sitaudiya ne kaha, solicytor general ne kuch dalile di hongi or kuch upbandhon kaa zikr kiya hoga
 We will see it, but we want to say that there is no bigger than an elected government and an elected assembly
 'aap' netaa evam varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki kuch niyam honge, jiske tahat sarkaar ke liye vidheyak ko purv manjuuri praapt karnaa jaruri hogi, lekin keval isliye ki anumati nahin lee gai, iske aadhaar par yah avaidh nahin hota, kyonki vidheyak ko raashtrapati kii manjuuri praapt kerani hoti he
 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh has targeted Lt Governor Najeeb Jung of Delhi and called him an agent of Congress
 saath hi unhone kaha ki is maamle main congress siyasat kar rahi he
 On Thursday, the Solicitor General has clearly stated on the opinion sought by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi that the Lokayukta bill would be illegal without the approval of the Union Home Ministry, as the bill spends from the Center's Consolidated Fund
 solicytor general kaa kahana he ki pehle se hi lokapal or lokayukta kanoon bana hua he, isliye dilli sarkaar ko apane janalokapal bill ko uparajyapal kii manjuuri ke liye unke paas bhejnaa hoga
 Not only this, even after passing the bill, the Lt
 Governor and then the President will have to be sent for approval, but the opinion of the Delhi Government is different from this
 dilli ke shiksha mantri manish sitaudiya ne kaha he, janata ne hamen chunaa he or usase upar koi nahin he


 vahiin yah faisla karegi ki kaisaa lokayukta bill ho
 At the same time Delhi Congress leader Aaron Yusuf has said that if the process of Janlokpal bill is correct then we will definitely support it, but looking at the Lok Sabha elections, they want to bring the bill unconstitutionally
 bhaajapa netaa sudhanshu trivedi kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ko samvidhan ke antargat rahakar kaam karnaa hoga
 
 
 From what they are doing, it proves that they have come to break the system rather than adding it
 sapa netaa naresh agarwal ne kaha ki kejariwal bhi jaanate hai ki unki sarkaar zyada din nahin chalane vaali, isliye vah loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan rakhkar is tarah ke asanvaidhanik faisle le rahe hai, taaki janata ko lubhaa saken

 The Ministry is preparing a note which will be discussed in the Union Cabinet which will refer to the recommendation of the President to dissolve the 82-member Jharkhand Legislative Assembly
 jharkhand vidhansabha ko abhi sthagit rakhaa gaya he
 He said that only after the dissolution of the assembly, the process of Election Commission elections can begin in the state early next year
 jharkhand main 18 janvari ko raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi samaapt ho rahi he
 The state is currently under President's rule, while speaking about approving President's rule in Jharkhand, Home Minister p Chidambaram had said in Lok Sabha on July 14 that the government would hold assembly elections in the state after the monsoon
 unhone kaha tha ‘‘yah meri ichha he ki jharkhand main jald se jald nayi sarkaar bane
 i am confident that the election will be held soon after the monsoon
 ’’ jharkhand main raajnneetik asthirataa ke kaaran 19 janvari ko chah maheene ke liye raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya tha, jo mukhyamantri shibu sorain ke tamaar seat se upachunaav main haar ke kaaran istife ke kaaran utpann hua tha

 tamil superstar rajnikant (rajinikanth) ne mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ko jawaharlal nehru or rajeev gandhi jaisaa ‘‘karishmai'' netaa bataate hue loksabhaa chunaav (loksabha Elections 2019) main bijepi (BJP) kii prachand jeet kaa shrey unke netritv ko diya
 He also said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi does not need to resign after the party's crushing defeat
 unhone kaha ki vah yuva hai or shaayad unhen party ke varisht netaaon kaa sahyog nahin mila
 Rajinikanth said that he would attend the Prime Minister's swearing-in ceremony on Thursday and got an invitation to attend the ceremony
 unhone yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘loksabhaa chunaavon main jeet ekal netritv kii jeet he or vah he modi
 This victory is the victory of a charismatic leader
 ''is varisht sine kalakaar ne bharat ke oonche kad ke netaaon jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi, atal bihari vaajapeyi, ke kamraj, sien annadurai, emji ramchandran, em karunanidhi or je jayalalita kii shrenee main modi (PM Modi) ko rakhte hue kaha, ‘‘unke baad (desh ko) modi mili, ek karishmai netaa
 If you see in Tamil Nadu, then there have been leaders like Kamaraj, Anna, Kalainar, MGR, Jayalalithaa
 isi tarj par yah jeet modi ke netritv se hasil hui he
 He (rajinikanth) said that due to the 'anti-modi' wave in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the BJP (BJP) had to face defeat while there was an air of support for Modi in the rest of the country
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab ek raajnneetik lahar hoti he, to koi uske khilaaf nahin tair saktaa or vah bah jayega
 The superstar said the BJP suffered defeat due to the Sterlite case of Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, the methane gas extraction project at Cauvery mouth and the "massive publicity" of opposition parties
 unhone (rajinikanth) rahul gandhi ke istife dene ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘‘unhen tyaagptr nahin dena chahie
 He said, "I don't say that they don't have leadership qualities
" mujhe lagata he ki congress party ko sanbhaalanaa vaaki mushkil kaam he jahaan kaaphi varisht log hai
 The Tamil superstar said that Gandhi does not need to resign as the opposition party is also important in democracy
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone (rajinikanth) kaha ki centre ko tamilnadu ke jal sankat ko turant hal karnaa chahie
 He praised the Centre's stand that it was trying to connect the Godavari and Krishna rivers
 (input bhashaa se) Senior BJP leader LK Advani has become immolated in the house of his close aide and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 aisa unke apano ne hi kiya he
 Advani is arriving in the city, but Advani is missing from hoardings, banners and posters all over the city
 adwani ko shuukravaar ko desh ke purv raashtrapati e
 P
 je
 Abdul Kalam was to attend the inaugural function of the Scientific Convention Center on Shahmina Road
 ve kaarykram main shaamil bhi hue
 But the hoardings, banners and posters that were put up all over the city regarding the program, Advani has no place in the place
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik lakhanu se saansad lalji tandon ke ishaare par hi party se jude logon ne bade-bade binar, poster jagah-jagah lagaae the
 But there was a picture of Atal in the posters and hoardings, but the picture of 'iron man' is missing
 party ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha, 'aisa modi ke chaahane vaale hi kar sakate hai
 Otherwise, it is a matter of great sadness that there is no picture of Advani with Atal
 modi kheme kii ore se yah sab suniyojit tareeke se kiya gaya he
 Advani was absent from the huge hoardings near the Convention Center, State Office, Kaiserbagh, Noor Manzil and Gomti Bridge in Nishatganj in Lucknow
 aayojanakartaaon se isaki vajah puche jane par koi bhi shaks munh kholane ko taiyaar nahin
 It was also discussed that party president Rajnath Singh was not intentionally sent to attend the event
 rajnath ke alaava narendra modi ko bhi nyotaa nahin bheja gaya, jabaki modi ke kareebi amit shah shuukravaar ko lakhanu aane vaale the
 But due to some reasons his late night tour was postponed
 kaarykram ko lekar sthaneey saansad lalji tandon kaa keval itnaa kahana he ki is kaarykram ko raajnneetik chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 When asked about this, BJP spokesperson Chandramohan Singh refused to comment on the issue
 gauratlab he ki saal 2012 main lakhanu main rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak yojit kii gai thi
 Even then, Advani was disappeared from banners and posters
 lekin maamle ne jab tool pakadaa, to ek bade netaa ke ishaare par ratorat binar, hordings badal die gaye the
 9321933400 and 7804907062, these are the two mobile numbers in which all the rajas are imprisoned
 yahi wo do number hai jinaki madad se jodhpur police asaram ke ird-gird kanoon kaa aisa shikanja kasnaa chaahati he ki asaram ke liye jail se baahar aana mushkil ho jaae
 Actually, the first of these two numbers is 9321933400 of Asaram
 asaram khaas logon se bas isi number par baat kiya karte the
 But he did not pick up the phone himself, nor touch the phone
 phone unka rasoiyaa prakaash uthaata tha or vahi phone asaram ke kaan main lagaataa tha
 The second number ie 7804907062 is of artisan
 usee shilpi kaa jisapar aarope he ki wo asaram ke gurukul main padhane vaali ladakiyon ko taiyaar kar unhen asaram ke paas ekantavaas main bhejti thi
 Asaram and his gurukul's warden, Shilpi, defraud the claims of both the call details on the fact that they tell themselves to be lakhs of Pak-clean
 jo shilpi isi saal march tak baba ko jaanane tak se inkaar kar rahi thi, vahi shilpi ek maheene baad yani april se baba se achaanak naa sirf baatcheet shuru kar detii he, balki jaise-jaise vaqt guzarataa he shilpi or baba kii baatcheet lambii hoti jaati he or ittefaq dekhie ki ek-do kol se shuru hui baatcheet kaa ye silsilaa dhire-dhire lagaataar badhata jaataa he or ye sabakuch tab tak chalata he, jab tak chhindwara ke gurukul main padhanevaali ladki ko asaram ke kalank kii kutiyaa tak pahunchaa nahin diya jaataa
 Asaram and his cunning Quartet may have a plea for this telephonic conversation, but the story the police narrates is very shocking and more shocking than the details and date of the phone call
 isi kol detail or taarikh main chupa he yon shoshan kii saazish kaa puraa sach
 , Till date
 shilpi ko asaram ke kehane par 15 march ko haridwar se chhindwara gurukul kaa warden bana kar bheja gaya tha
 On reaching Chhindwara, Shilpi took a new phone number and the number is 7804907062
 chhindwara pahunchane ke baad shilpi or asaram ke bich phone par 15 march se lekar 23 april tak ek baar bhi baat nahin hoti he
 Shilpi calls Asaram for the first time on 23 April
 iske baad duusari baar wo 27 april ko asaram ko phone karti he
 The phone was put on Asaram's mobile number 9321933400
 ye number kisi mandeep chhabda ke naam registerd he
 After two conversations in April, Shilpi calls Asaram on June 10 and 11 for the third and fourth time
 iske baad phir ek lanbaa gap aata he
 After June, Shilpi calls Asaram again on 22 and 31 July
 donon hi baar lambii baatcheet hoti he
 In this way, from April 23 to July 31, that is, in about three and a quarter months, Asaram and Shilpi together talk only six times in total
 iske baad 6 agast ko peedit ladki ke pet main dard hota he
 Here the pain arose, on the very next day i
e
 August 7, Shilpi again calls Asaram
 agle hi roj yani aath agast ko bhi phone par uski asaram se baat hoti he, lekin iske baad jaise-jaise aadki ko asaram ke paas pahunchaae jane kaa vaqt qareeb aata jaataa he, shilpi or asaram kii baatcheet kaa silsilaa badhata jaataa he
 On 9 August, when the girl leaves Chhindwara Gurukul to go to Jodhpur Asaram, Shilpi telephones Asaram
 iske baad donon ke bich 10 agast ko bhi baatcheet hoti he
 On 13 August, when the afflicted girl reaches Jodhpur to meet Asaram, Shilpi and Asaram still have a mobile conversation and all this continues till 17 August
 peedit ladki kii shikaayat mutabik asaram ne uske saath 15 agast ko zyaadati kii thi
 Though the media in-charge of the Ahmedabad Ashram, Udaya Sangani, says that the conversation between Shilpi and Asaram would have been about the arrangement of food and drink in Gurukul, but when asked why such a conversation did not happen between the two earlier, Sangani had There was no strong answer
 ab sawaal ye he ki chah agast se lekar 17 agast tak hi shilpi or asaram ke bich itani baatcheet kyon hui or 17 agast ke baad se achaanak donon ke bich baatcheet kyon band ho gai? jodhpur police isi sawaal kaa jawaab talash rahi he
 The call details of Asaram and Shilpi are another shocking truth and that is the time of conversation
 23 april se lekar 31 july tak jo chah kol shilpi ne asaram ko kiye the unamem se sabase lambii baatcheet 31 july ko hui thi
 Shilpi spoke to Asaram for one minute and 18 seconds, while the remaining five times barely both talked for five to fifteen seconds
 par 6 agast ko peedit ladki biimaar padati he or agle hi din saat agast ko shilpi asaram se kul chah minute paanch senked tak baat karti he
 Longest conversation ever
 saat agast kii subah hi chhindwara gurukul kaa diarector sharat chandra apane mobile number 9354719340 se asaram ko phone karata he or 6 minute 32 second tak baat karata he
 Sharat Chandra had never called Asaram in the past six months
 iske baad aath agast ko shilpi asaram se 4 minute 34 second baat karti he
 Shiva also calls Asaram from his mobile the same day and 2
 34 sencond baat karata he
 On August 9, the victim leaves Gurukul for her home and on August 10, Shilpi talks to Bapu over the phone for seven minutes
 iske baad 13 agast ko jab ladki baba ke paas pahuchan jaati he tab shilpi 5
 She talks to Baba on the phone for 30 minutes
 shilpi kii asaram se aakhri baatcheet 17 agast ko hoti he or aakhri baar donon main ab tak kii sabase lambii baatcheet aath minute kii hoti he
 The amazing thing is that Asaram has around four and a half hundred ashrams and gurukuls across the country, but no warden had the courage and permission to speak directly to Asaram on the phone, except Shilpi
 sabase khaas baat ye ki saat agast se lekar 17 agast tak asaram ke phone kaa lokation lagaataar rajasthan hi tha

 supreme court ke chaar nyaayadhishon ke bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish (sijeai) ke kaamkaaj par aapatti jaahir karne ke masale ke patakshep kaa elaan somvaar ko baar council ne kar jarur diya par kuch sawaal abhi bhi jinda hai
 One of these is the seniority of the judges
 chaar jajon kii chitthee main hi zikr he ki pradhan nyaayadhish "first amang icwals, nathing mor nathing les" yani sijeai supreme court ke baaki jajon ke baraabar hai, na zyada na kam
 This too is a system based on tradition or belief
 supreme court main bahut si chijen paramparaon par chal rahi hai or paramparaayen alikhit hoti hai
 The case of seniority also comes in this
 maujuuda pradhan nyaayadhish justise deepak mishra or duusare sabase senior jaj justise je
 Chelameswar was appointed on the same day on 10 October 2011
 sawaal ye he ki varishthata ke masale par vyavastha kya kahati he
 If two judges are appointed on the same day, then who will be considered senior
 is par vyavastha ye kahati he ki do jaj agar ek hi din supreme court main niyukt hue hon to varishthata ke maamle main unke hoicourt ke kaarykaal ko bhi sangyaan main liya jayega
 Justice Chelameswar lags Justice Deepak Mishra in this case
 unka ritairement bhi justise mishra (2 aktubar 2018) se pehle yani is saal 22 june ko ho rahaa he
 Apart from deciding the bench of cases, the decision of a judge is not greater than the decision
 do jajon kii peeth kaa faisla usase zyada sankhya vaale jajon kii peeth hi palat sakati he
 In the case of justice, the Chief Justice and the rest of the judges are equal
 teen talaak kaa maamla iskaa badhiya udhaaharan he jab tatkaaleen chif justise je
 s
 khehar or justise abdul nazeer kii raay teen talaak ko gaiyrkanoonee banane kii nahin thi
 But the remaining three judges considered it illegal and the verdict was delivered by a 3: 2 majority
 jaahir he prashasnic shaktiyon ke maamle main chif justise sarvopari he or master of roster yani cese kii peeth tay karne ke maamle main pichley dinon aae faisle se sthiti spasht ho chuki he
 The contradiction in the letter written by the judges is that on the one hand they say that the Chief Justice is equal to the rest of the judges in the matter of justice and on the other hand they are questioning the allotment of important cases by citing their seniority
 jab sabhi jaj baraabar hai to cese ke alotment main senior-junior dekhnaa kitna nyaaysangat he
 Explain that the film also stars Madhuri Dixit, Anil Kapoor, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Boman Irani and Javed Jaffrey
 'total dhamal' 'dhamal' frenchiji kii teesri film he
 It will be directed by Indra Kumar and it will be released on 7 December 2018

 co / lynrzclfw0 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi held a special conversation with Aaj Tak on the Ram Temple issue and Adityanath Yogi becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 ovaisi ne kaha ki ayodhya vivaad par court ko jald se jald se faisla sunaanaa chahie
 The Muslim Personal Law Board will not talk to anyone, on the Supreme Court's comment on the Ayodhya case, MP from Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi said that this is not an order but an observation
 jhagada tital kaa he, jiske paas tital he, usee ke haq main faisla hoga
 There have been talks many times before, which did not yield any results
 ol india muslim personal lau bordne yah faisla kiya he ki ab vah kisi se baatcheet nahin karenge
 The Personal Board has said that this issue should be heard daily and a decision should be taken as soon as possible
 ayodhya vivaad par jald faisla kare cortowaisi kaa kahana he ki jab supreme court chhuttiyon main teen talaak ke masale par baith saktaa he, to ayodhya mudde par bhi lagaataar sunwaayee honi chahie
 The Supreme Court is saying that this is a serious matter
 jab teen talaak kaa masalaa sun rahe hai to usee ke saath main is masale ko bhi sun lijie
 Decide quickly because this issue has been discussed six times before
 desh ko hindu raashtra bananaa chaahati he bjpyogi ke mukhyamantri banane par ovaisi ne kaha kibijepiur yogi donon se hi hamaara virodh he
 The ideology of both is to create a Hindu nation
 hamaara virodh bijepi se he or aage bhi rahegaa
 The second thing is that if the abattoirs of Uttar Pradesh are closed, then the state will suffer a loss of 11 thousand 680 crores
 dikhaava he 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas'siem adityanathke 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kii baat par ovaisi ne kaha ki ham jaanate hai ki yah sirf ek naaraa he, isamen koi hakeekat nahin he
 If there was talk of everyone's development, any Muslim would have been given a ticket
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki hindu raashtra banane ke saath hindustan ko kamjor karne kii puri koshish ho rahi he
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is now increasingly realizing that votes cannot be distributed only by distributing cash and concessions to the public
 congress main haal ke dinon main achaanak ubhare asantosh ke baad ek cabinet mantri kaa istipha ho chukaa he or ek anya mantri ne agle chunaav main khadey hone se inkaar kar diya he
 Revenue Minister and a prominent Jat leader from Barmer, Hemaram Chaudhary, resigned on July 24
 iske baad unhone apni car or angrakshak bhi lautaa die or sarkari kaamon se bhi kinaaraa kar liya
 Prior to his resignation, he was in talks with pro-congress farmers in Leelana, from where the proposed refinery has been shifted to Pachapadra
 rifinary rajya ke sansadhano se sthapit ho rahi he
 From the very first day of the announcement, some controversy has arisen regarding this
 bijepi ne rifinary ke liye centre se anudaan na le paane par gahalot ke upar sawaal uthaaya or prachaarit kiya ki isse rajya main sansadhano kaa abhaav ho jayega
 Also, it will take ten years, unlike the promise of commissioning in four years
 rifinary lagane vaali company hindustan petroleum korporation limited ke saath sarkaar ke anubandh par soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya gaya
 The government feared that it would reignite its mismanagement
 barmer main tel or gas pariyojnaon ke liye gahalot kii ore se avastavik staron tak muaavje ke elaan ke baad kisaanon ne or zyada muaavje kii maang kar daali
 After this, land deals started in Pachpadra near the place where the landlords sold the land to the leaders for a lot of money under the benami deals
 rifinary pachapadara le jane ke elaan par gahalot sarkaar par jameen ghotaale ke bhi aarope lage
 On this matter, an angry Congress MLA, Colonel Sonaram, accused Gehlot that he was preparing the ground to contest his son Vaibhav Gehlot from Pachpadra for the election
 aarope bhi congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv or rajasthan prabharee gurdas kaamat ke saamne lagaaya
 Gehlot denied this
 sonaaram ne hemaram par bhi kisaanon ke hiton kii raksha na kar paane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The landowners of this area are mostly poor
 leelana or pachapadara donon jagah sabase zyada nuksaan inhen hi hua he
 Because of this, Hemaram had to resign
 istife ke 18 ghante baad tak sarkaar isse inkaar karti rahi
 On July 25, Gehlot said, "hemaram is very emotional
 yah mudda to bahut sthaneey kism kaa he
 Gehlot indicated that Hemaram would be persuaded to withdraw his resignation
 lekin is puure ghatnakram ne rifinary ke mudde kii sachai ujagar kar di
 Gehlot kept it under control for four years and remembered it in the election year
 kuch hi din pehle 22 july ko gahalot ke bharosemand lok nirmaan mantri bharat singh ne kaamat ke saamne congress kii ek baithak main kaha tha ki ve aglaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 His complaint was that the party has appointed officials who have no support base

 Buoyed by the last two wins, the Sunrisers Hyderabad will play their first match on Monday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium home ground under the seventh edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 mumbai indiens ke khilaaf is match main unhen darshakon se milane vaale samarthan kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 With two wins from eight in the IPL-7, the Indians are in second place in the eight teams' points table, on the other hand, with four wins in eight, the Sunrisers, who are in fifth position, are looking heavily at Indians
 indiens ke liye ipel-7 ab tak kaaphi naakaami bharaa rahaa he
 After registering two wins on home ground after returning home, he suffered a loss to Chennai Super Kings in the last match
 indiens ne ab tak balle or gend donon se bahut hi ausat pradarshan kiya he
 Instead of combined success in bowling, only Lasith Malinga has been able to perform effectively
 ballebaaji main indiens kaa koi bhi ballebaaj sheersh 10 ballebaajon kii suchi main jagah nahin bana paaya he, vahiin gendbaaji main tisare sthaan par maujuud malinga 13 wicket ke saath sheersh 20 gendbaajon kii suchi main indiens ke akele khilaadi hai
 Sunrisers have also failed to leave a special mark in batting, but they can be considered the most aggressive of the IPL-7 in terms of bowling
 deth overon main unhone jis tarah vipakshi tiimon ko lakshya paane ke liye sangharsh karne par majaboor kiya he, usase koi bhi team dabaav main aa sakati he
 David Warner is the most batsman of the Sunrisers
 aath maichon kii aath pariyon main 242 ran banaakar warner aathven paaydaan par hai
 Lokesh Rahul has proved his ability by playing small but very useful innings consistently
 duusari ore, sunrisers ke bhubaneshwar kumaar ipel-7 main ab tak ke sheersh gendbaaj hai
 Bhubaneswar 5
 49 kii iconmi se 173 ran dekar 15 wicket hasil kiye hai
 Apart from Bhubaneswar, Dale Steyn Sunrisers have been extremely effective as the second main bowling attack
 sunrisers ke liye keeran pollard sabase badi chunauti rahenge, to indiens ke gendbaajon ke liye warner ke balle ko chup karana sabase bada uddeshy rahegaa
 This will be the ninth match for both the teams in IPL-7, while it will be the fourth match between the two teams in the IPL
 sunrisers ne ab tak do baar indiens ko haraaya he, jabaki indiens sunrisers par ek jeet hi darj kar sake hai
 Teams (probable): sunrisers hyderabad : shikhar dhawan (captain), aron finch, david warner, lokesh rahul, naman ojha, darren saimi, karn sharma, del sten, bhubaneshwar kumaar, ishanth sharma, irfan pathan
 Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (captain), Landil Simmons, CM Gautam (wicketkeeper), Ambati Rayudu, Corey Anderson, Kieran Pollard, Aditya Tare, Harbhajan Singh, Jaspreet Bumrah, Praveen Kumar and Lasith Malinga

 ek ore jahaan kuch din pehle kochi kii sadakon par kuch transgender hinsa kaa shikaar hue the vahiin duusari ore isi samudaay ke kuch log isi shahar main rahakar kuch aisa kar rahe hai, jo ab tak asambhav lagata tha
 No matter how much modernity has come, the level of literacy has increased, but the truth is that even today the society hesitates to accept them
 paristhitiyaan kuch aisi bana di jaati hai ki sammaan ke saath rahanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 But the initiative has already taken place
 
 
 isi samudaay ke kuch log aage badhkar itihaas rach rahe hai
 a transgender appearing on the cover of a well-known magazine is a huge success in itself and this is not the only example
 kochi shahar main hi ek transgender ek pratishthit restraan main kaisier hai
 24-year-old Deepti Nair's arrival on Kerala's famous magazine Vanita is not only a big achievement for her, but it is also very special for the society
 dipti do saal pehle tak shinoj thim lekin aaj wo ek safal model hai
 a 29-year-old satiety, just a few kilometers away, is a cashier in Pappadavada, a famous restaurant in Kochi
 tripti ek transgender hai or apane pairon par khadi hai
 Satisfaction says who in the world would be someone who would like to live by begging
 transgender kabhi bhi aage nahin bad paae kyonki logon ne unhensamaajik str par kabhi sweekaar hi nahin kiya
 They did not even get a chance to work
 wo bataati hai ki jab unhone yahaan naukari shuru kii to restraan ke maalik ke alaava unhone kisi ko bhi ye nahin bataaya tha ki wo transgender hai
 She says that she had a great fear about people's thinking
 ek maheene baad, tripti ne sabko sachai bataa di lekin acchhee baat ye rahi ki kisi ne bhi tripti ke saath bura vyavhaar nahin kiya
 Everyone in the restaurant calls them Chechi, which means elder sister
 teen saal pehle tak tripti shetty, kiran shetty thim
 He underwent surgery three years ago
 lekin uske baad inkaa jivan aasaan nahin tha
 After the death of her parents, she is forced to beg
 lekin 29 varshiya tripti aaj apane pairon par khadi hai
 She is working as a cashier in Kochi's Pappadavada Restaurant
 Pappadavada restraan ke maalik minu polin kaa kahana he ki ham sabhi ek baraabar hai or transgender hona koi galat baat to he nahin
 We must accept them and move forward
 yahi vajah thi ki maine tripti ko kaam par rakhaa
 She never makes excuses and is very serious about her work
 dhire dhire hi sahi samaaj is samudaay ko sweekaar kar rahaa he
 Another example of this is the Kochi Metro Rail Limited, which opened its doors to transgenders for housekeeping and customer service jobs in June
 2017 main ye metro rail sova shuru ho jaaegi
 When India declared the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees illegal in the country from midnight on 8 November 2016, it affected all the economies of South Asia
 khaas asar do padosi desh bhutan or nepal par dikhaai diya kyonki bharat in donon desh kaa sabase bada trading partner he
 Due to this, the shine of Indian currency in these two countries is exactly the same as the dollar shines in the whole world including India
 yahi vajah he rupaya jitna ganda(kaala) bharat main ho chukaa tha utana hi in donon deshon main bhi hua
 How impaired Bhutan's Happiness Index? Talking about Bhutan, its economy has been designed in such a way that this country will always import from India
 is desh kaa trade balance hameshaa negative rahegaa
 The Central Bank of Bhutan considers the Indian rupee as a legal tender, that is, the Indian rupee is also equal to the domestic currency
 iske saath hi bhutan apane aarthik vikaas ke liye sadaiv bhartiya rupee par nirbhar rahegaa
 This can be gauged from the fact that the largest portion of the annual budget of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (about one-third, more than Rs
 5000 crores) is spent on Bhutan
 isiilie 8 november kii raat jab 500 or 1000 rupee kii note raddi qaraar di gai to 9 november kii subah seemaa se sate bhutan ke funtasholing shahar ke bainko ke aage nai dilli ke kisi bank jaisi lambii qatari lagi thi
 On the morning of 9 November, Bhutan's monarchy was constantly in touch with the Ministry of External Affairs to deal with the situation arising
 lekin desh main piemo kii kaman main shuru hui notebandi ke bich khud videsh mantralay ke paas sthiti se ladane kaa koi suzav nahin tha
 The Royal Central Bank of Bhutan also kept in touch with the Reserve Bank and State Bank of India on what it should and should not do to change notes
 ise bhi padhein: modi sarkaar ko cash se dikkat lekin japan main top gear par he cash iconomibhutan kaa dainik angreji akhbaar kunsel khabaren chhapata rahaa ki bhutan kii janata gaiyrkanoonee qaraar di gai bhartiya karency ko badalane ke liye qatari main khadaa he
 It was also speculated in the newspaper that from across the border, Indian businessmen are queuing the citizens of Bhutan outside the banks on the lure of commission
 saath hi is baat kii sambhaavna bhi jaahir hoti rahi ki bharat se aarthik rishton ke chalate desh main badi sankhya main kalaadhan zyada surakshit samajhe jane vaali bhartiya karency main maujuud he jo baahar nikal rahaa he
 Like the demolition of Pakistani racket in Nepal, Nepal is another country where the rupee acts as a legal tender
 bhartiya rupee ko nepal ke bainkon main graahak apane khate main bina kisi bhedbhaav ke jamaa kara sakate hai
 Nepal's currency is tied to the Indian rupee (peg currency) in the international currency market, due to which the rupee depreciates against the dollar, the same fall is added to the currency of Nepal
 haalanki bhutan se alag, nepal aisa desh he jo bharat ke saath-saath china se bada kaarobaar karata he
 But a large number of Nepalese citizens (more than 5 million) work in India and keep their earnings in Nepal
 bharat sarkaar nepal kii arthvyavastha main bada nivesh karata he
 There is a large amount of Indian currency in Nepal's central bank

 mukhyamantri raman singh ke grih nagar rajanandgaanv main hajaaron kii taadaad main kisaan unhen apni fariyaad sunaane pahunche the, lekin raman singh se unki mulaakaat nahin ho pai
 In fact, the Chief Minister is out of the state for two days to attend the BJP Parliamentary Board meeting in Delhi
 lihaaja rajya ke krishi mantri ne morcha sambhala
 Actually the aggrieved farmers are demanding that the crop insurance scheme should be implemented not for the benefit of the insurance companies but in the interest of the farmers
 isi maang ke saath ye kisaan doordaraj ke ilaakon se yahaan pahunche
 They want to tell Chief Minister Raman Singh that who is benefiting from the crop insurance scheme? According to the farmers, they were told that after the implementation of the crop insurance scheme, it would be good for them, provided that they get their crop insured at the right time
 Take it
 iske saath hi is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki uske premium kaa bhugtan samay par ho
 The farmers took all these things and got their crop insured and paid their premium on time, but when the turn came to pay the insurance of crop loss, the insurance companies raised their hands
 companiyon ne kisaanon ko saaf kar diya ki unki fasal nuksaan ke prakaran fasal beemaa yojana ke maapdandon ko puraa nahin karte
 After the farmers' uproar, insurance companies agreed to pay but on their own terms
 beemaa companiyon ne kisaanon ko ek, do, paanch or das rupee prati acre ke hisaab se fasal nuksaan kii rakam kii adaayagi kii
 At the same time, the loss of 2017 has not been paid yet, so these farmers want to reach Rajnandgaon and get the Chief Minister aware of his situation
 premium main kisaanon ne kharch kiye hajaaron rupepradarshan kar rahe kisaan tikam verma ke mutabik unke gaanv ke saikadon kisaanon ko 2 rupee se lekar 30 rupee tak kaa nuksaan beemaa mila he, jabaki kisaanon ne hajaaron rupee bime ke premium main phoonk die
 He told that insurance companies are earning a lot from crop insurance but the government is not paying attention to it
 yahi haal kisaan chandu sahu ne bhi sunaaya
 He said that the farmers have not benefited from this scheme
 unhone maang kii ki vyaktigat taur par kisaanon kaa fasal beemaa hona chahie, naa ki grampanchayaton ko unit maanakar
 He said that farmers are being harmed by this
 udhar rajya ke krishi mantri brijmohan agarwal kii daleel he ki yah yojana kisaanon ke liye phydemand sabit ho rahi he
 According to him, last year, about Rs 300 crore as premium went to the insurance companies account, while more than 1200 crore was deposited by the insurance companies as compensation in the account of the farmers
 chhattisgarh main varsh 2017 main bhayankar sookhaa padaa tha
 The government had declared 96 tehsils of 21 districts as drought-stricken
 is dauraan hajaaron kisaanon kii fasal puri tarah se chaupat ho gai thi, gine chune kisaan hi apni fasal kii laagat nikaal paae
 And nothing came in the hands of most farmers
 aise main kisaanon ko ummid thi ki unhone fasal beemaa ke premium ke rup main johjaron rupekharch kiye hai usase unhen nuksaan kii bharpai ho jaayegi lekin beemaa companiyon ne kisaanon ke zyaadaatar maamle sire se khaarij kar die
 Out of the 13 lakhs, only 5 lakh farmers were eligible for compensation
 In the 2017 season, about 13 lakh farmers of the state had got crop insurance, all these farmers were the borrowers of cooperative banks
 bainkon ke jariye hi premium kii rakam beemaa companiyon ke khate main transfar hui thi
 After the drought, when the insurance companies took stock of the farmers' fields, only 5 lakh farmers were found eligible for compensation out of 13 lakh
 inamen se 30 fisadi aise kisaan the jinhen muaavje ke rup main do, paanch or das rupee mili
 There are more than 37 lakh registered farmers in Chhattisgarh, but barely 12 to 13 lakh farmers provide crop insurance
 darasal kheti ke liye in kisaanon kaa karj lenaa jaruri he isliye fasal beemaa unki majaburi ban gai he
 Banks do not give loans to farmers without getting crop insurance
 duusari ore fasal beemaa hone ke baad beemaa companiyaan unki ore se apana munh pher leti hai
 In such a situation, farmers feel that the crop insurance scheme is not for their benefit but for the benefit of insurance companies

 isse pehle kuch dashakon main teen indonesian raashtrapati bharat kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Abdurrahman Wahid visited in 2000, Megawati Sukarnoputri in 2002 and Yudhoyona himself in 2005
 seshan 10: yuvaaon kaa haath kiske saathvaktaa:kiran bedi, saamaajik kaaryakartarandeep singh surajevaala, congressnurag thakur, bijepiaditya thakare, shivasenakumar vishwaas, aapcumki bharat yuvaaon kaa desh he isliye raajnneeti main bhi yuvaaon kaa pratinidhitiv hona chahie
 This representation also appears to have increased in recent times
 panchayat aaj tak ke is seshan main yuva netaaon se unki samajhadaari, praathamikta or vijan par baaten huin
 Question: The campaign has started, not hardcore thinking, young enthusiasm, but it is not visible anywhere
 surajevaala:aaj kaa noujvaan aspireshnal he
 Is energetic
 baichaiyn he, badlaav chahta he, raajnneeti or shashan main hissaa chahta he
 You asked what we could do
 ek tarika he ki sab tod dijie, sab chor hai, sansad ko gira dijie
 There is another way, which Congress showed
 samooche hindustan ko lekar chalem
 Where Kumar Vishwas and Thackeray could disagree with me and walk
 yuvaaon kii positive energy kaa istemaal karen
 Anurag Thakur: The country has to decide whether it needs a young leader who did nothing
 yaa aisa yuvaaon kaa netaa chahie, jisane 13 varshon main kitna kuch kar dikhaaya he
 If someone is tested and tested, then Modi is there
 ek karod 3 lakh log fasebuk pej par modi ji se jude hai
 There is no page of the Congress leader
 aaj kaa yuva teen i chahta he
 Education, Empowerment and Employment
 gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaron ne 10 fisadi se zyada kii dar se tarakkee kii
 We are going in the name of good governance and development
 congress ab bhi communalism par baat kar rahi he
 Kiran Bedi: Lokpal was mentioned
 main aapako diarect avidence duungi
 The date was 28 August 2011
 anna ke anshan kaa 10waan yaa 11waan din tha
 It seemed that if the fast is not broken today, one may have to go to the hospital
 tab rahul yahaan nahin the
 Sonia was probably out for treatment
 rahul gandhi waapas aae
 We have a hope
 28 agast ko khabar ai ki rahul hindustan waapas aae
 As soon as he came, he spoke in Parliament
 unhone likhit bhaashan padhaa or tamaam yuvaaon kaa dil tod diya
 What did you say
 ye kya maang rahe hai
 We will bring a constitutional body
 samay se laaenge
 We were surprised
 rajyasabha main simple memaurity nahin he
 How to get it dhakka laga
 After that you saw what happened
 kanoon laae 17 disambar 2013 ko
 Lay down hamaara andolan lokapal bill ke liye tha
 He had numbers in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main bijepi ke paas number the
 We were in contact with them
 jetali sahab, swaraj sahab, adwani ji
 Everyone was agreeing
 ve hamaare sujhaavon kaa swaagat kar rahe the
 Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi played an important role
 magar mudda ye he ki rahul gandhi ne ek sunaharaa mauka ganvaa diya
 Surjewala: We all revere Kiran Bedi as a young man
 unka bijepi se nayaa nayaa pyaar he
 But i want to say that how long will the politics of pressure on Parliament continue to sit in Ramlila Maidan
 kiran bedi:anna congress kii taalamatol ke baad phir anshan par baith gaye
 By then, the Congress had lost four seats
 anna bhi baith gaye
 Double pressure
 or kitna nuksaan hoga
 On the other hand, Narayan Swami Saheb started speaking on TV
 ki ham bill laa rahe hai
 i called at the Rajya Sabha Secretariat
 bataaya abhi to agenda main bhi nahin aayaa he
 i told Anna that he was lying
 tab anna ne bolaa ki agenda kahaan hai
 The government is lying again
 november 2012 se disambar 2013 tak sarkaar bill par baithi rahi
 That is why, on passing the bill, Anna thanked everyone except SP
 kumaar vishwaas:agar kiran ji ye kah rahi hai ki anna hajaare ke andolan ko bijepi saport kar rahi thi
 So she is breaking the hearts of crores of people
 agar bijepi yaa sangh ne samartham kiya to use nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 But he did not have any person on the stage
 digvijay singh baar baar kehete the ki sangh ke log hai
 All the leaders including Kiran Ji had said that it is not so
 sawaal: anna ne jab andolan kiya, tab duniya main 20 hajaar jagah andolan hua
 But when the bill was passed, there was no joy in one place
 kyon?kiran bedi:yahi sawaal main uthaanaa chaahati hum
 The Aam Aadmi Party rejected it without reading the bill
 kaha, chuha bhi nahin mar saktaa
 Aditya Thackeray: The issue had to be whose hands with the youth
 jo college main pard rahe hai
 Canteen bathrooms are bad
 naukariyaan nahin aa rahi hai
 i do not know what to do after studying
 sarhad par jo tainaat hai, unke bare main koi soch rahaa he yaa nahin
 There will be elections
 aarope lagenge
 But those who win will come
 wo saath main kaam karenge
 Question: Your party is over 40 years old
 shivasena kii chhavi he goyaa gundgardee karne vaali party he
 What is your party's agenda
 kya badlaav hua he
 Aditya: More work is going on than change
 main khud 23 saal kaa hum
 The work we are doing as a youth army
 aaj main haq se kah saktaa hum
 We could provide new canteens and bathrooms in 30-40 colleges in Mumbai
 mumbai press club ke masale kii baat hui
 There was no Vandalism
 diserpshad hua
 We are taking work nae log jud rahe hai
 We are building Yuva Sena in every district of Tamil Nadu
 nakaab pahanane kii jarurat kya he
 We are going outside Maharashtra
 sawaal: aajkal modi jo cheharaa pregent kar rahe hai, development oriented baat kar rahe hai
 But he also talks about Hindutva
 desh kaa punaranirmaan hoga yaa hindu raashtra kaa nirmaan?anuraag thakur
 The country needs development and good governance, we will do it in the states, we will try it in the country
 jo log baar baar communalism kii, sampradayikta kii baat kar rahe hai
 His problem is that there is nothing to tell in his ten-year tenure
 abhi chaar rajyon main chunaav hue
 70 percent won seats
 kahin hindutv kaa naaraa nahin diya gaya
 We made Madhya Pradesh the state ahead of Birmu state
 hamaara agenda hindutv nahin sushasan or vikaas he
 When we have celebrated the 75th anniversary of independence
 to laal kile se piem kahe
 The country has 100 percent literacy
 aditya:hamaare liye bhi vikaas ahm he
 But we are not ashamed to say that we are Hindus
 hamaara hindutv ye he ki jab hamaare jawan hemraj kaa sir kataa or ajmer sharif kii dargah ke logon ne kaha ki pakistan ke logon ko ham nahin ghusane denge
 So our party mps went and respected him
 ye hamaara hindutv he
 Surjewala: Skill development of youth
 mauka dena hoga
 There may be differences of parties
 magar rasta spasht he
 We have been talking about the same
 aditya thakare:jo bhi piem bane
 Create a National Youth Council
 har field ke yuva usamen hon
 There should be direct interaction with PM

 These efforts have also reduced the cost of electricity generation
 yah 2014 ke 6
 2 below the benchmark of 9 rupees
 5 rupye tak pahunch gai he
 This has been largely due to the rapid fall in the prices of components such as solar panels, as well as initiated efforts like 'reverse bids' have also contributed to cost reduction

 During that time, 73 major road projects were stuck due to several factors

 Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari persuaded the promoters with bankers to swallow some bitter pill (39 projects were also canceled) to start the hanging project in Adhar

 In this, NHAI ensured 40 per cent annual return and the remaining 60 per cent required capital management

 Road construction across the country averaged less than 10 km per day in 2013–14, reaching an average of 26–29 km per day in 2017–18 and especially in late 2018–19

 The reason? Land acquisition is still a challenge and financially strong big corporate houses were not coming forward due to high risk and low returns
 sadak nirmaan main utre kuch nae khiladinnon kaa is kshetra kaa anubhav bahut kam he or isliye bainkon ko andeh he ki kai pariyojnaayen puri nahin ho sakengi

 "another important step was also to adopt the National Civil Aviation Policy which aims to make air travel more affordable and to create an economic mechanism for airlines to expand business
 haalanki, iskaa karyanvayan bahut kharaab rahaa he
 Keeping the fuel of the ship outside the purview of GST has also increased the cost of the airline sector

 After Kangana, now Hrithik has put his side in the TV interview
 rithik ne intervyuu ke dauraan kuch jaruri sawaalon ke jawaab die hai
 Putting her side, she said, 'I have never had any relationship with Kangana
 mujhe jab unke email mil rahe the, tab maine is bare main sabase shikaayat kii
 i did not even read his mail, i adopted a legal way to deal with this and sent legal notice to Kangana with the help of my lawyer
 yahaan tak ke unke parents ko bhi
 i thought a solution would come out of it, but it was considered my threat
 kangana se afaire-vivaad: 2 saal baad rithik ne 766 shabdon main di safai'main jhagada karne waalon main se nahin hum
 i never fought in life
 kisi purush se na mahila se
 Even in my divorce case there was no quarrel
 main jaanata hum ki jo main kar rahaa hum vah koi acchhee baat nahin he
 It is not an honor to sit here and make a statement about your character
 lekin mujhe ab sach saamne laana hoga
 i was afraid that my words would be taken the wrong way
 yadi main majbootee ke saath pesh hota hum to mujhe agressive kaha jayega or imonshnal hounga ko kamjor kaha ja saktaa hum
 First i wanted to solve this matter at my level
 main ise deal kar saktaa tha, lekin jab kangana ne 'maay eks sili' vaala bayaan diya, tab ye maamla saarvajanik ho gaya
 If i had kept quiet, people would have believed Kangana's talk that i had a relationship with her
 isliye mujhe is bare main bolnaa padaa

 iske baavjood unhone koi ection kyon nahin liya
 Hrithik said, i enlisted the help of my cyber team

 Consulted people
 pehle mujhe laga ki koi kisi anya ko in mail ko bhejnaa chahta he
 Actually, these mails were being sent to the wrong ID
 baad main ise meri sahi imail idi par bheja gaya
 Proud that Kangana was extremely professional, when Hrithik was asked about a mail from Kangana, in which he has told Hrithik his close friend, Hrithik replied, 'we did not become good friends
 maine unhen behad profeshnal paaya tha
 Not only in Kites, but also in bulk
 mujhe unki is baat par garv he
 i have said this before
 unhone meri filmon main ahm yogadan diya he

 It took only a few months for Mahi to come true

 Dhoni's hair is now full of whiteness, commandos are cut instead of wavy slaves - but he is still a big style icon
 unke bal pehle ghunghraale hua karte the, jise ranchi ke kaaya salon ke dhiraj kumaar ne sidhaa kiya or ranga
 This is where Dhoni was inspired to have long hair
 haalanki maahi ke dost kehete hai ki ve style or fishan ke bare main na to parvaah karte hai or na hi zyada jaanate hai
 After becoming captain, English had to shine for the press conference, but his style among friends is still desi

 When Dhoni was asked whether he would become a commentator like the rest of his colleagues after retiring from cricket? He quickly said, "of course not

 par aashcharya he ki pal-pal badalati duniya main bhi saalon se maahi ke pyaar nahin badale
 In cities where they spend more time, they definitely keep their motorcycles

 Asked about his hunger to play big innings, Kohli said, "I don't know, i think because of captaincy you try more than normal batting
 mujhe lagata he ki jab aap captain banate ho to atmugdhata ke liye jagah nahin bachati
 So it is related to playing my long innings
 ’ He said, 'I always wanted to play long innings and my initial seven or eight centuries were not even more than 120 innings
 iske baad maine lambii paariyaan khilne kaa prayaas kiya or apni utsukata ko niyantrit kiya or kisi bhi samay atmamugdhata se bachane kii koshish kii
 During this innings, Kohli became the first batsman in the world to score double centuries in four consecutive series in Test history

 The SP said, "what is the need for a separate army school to be opened by the RSS in the state?" This arouses suspicion
 ab vah rashtriya str par shadyantr karnaa chaahate hai, yah samvidhan kii avhelnaa he
 The Samajwadi Party (SP) said, "the RSS is following the ideology of partition

 Prime Minister Modi acknowledged that the oil consuming countries are facing many challenges on the economic front due to crude oil being expensive
 tel utpaadak desh agar tel upabhokta deshon kii is sankat se nipatane main madad karen to behatar hoga
 The statement of Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister is important, but he has also warned India that the challenges of the international oil market are huge and diplomatic tensions between us-iran and rising fears of global economic slowdown may have an impact on oil prices 
 soshal media, hologram avatar or selfi clic karne se lekar modi ne votaron ko lubhaane ke liye is chunaav main sabakuch kiya he
 The idea of contesting elections by making social media a weapon was picked up by the BJP from Barack Obama's election campaign
 jab baraak obama ne virtual world main 'yas ve can' kaa naaraa lagaate hue white house kii res main apane naam kar lee
 On the lines of Obama, Modi and BJP made their master plan
 virtual world main narendra modi twitor or fasebuk par sakriy hai
 Both these social media platforms have played a big role in the elections
 bijepi or narendra modi kaa chunaav prachar bhi soshal media kendrit rahaa
 If it was said that the 2014 election was a Twitter election, it would not be wrong
 bijepi ko chhod modi akele hi twitor par chhaae rahe hai
 There were millions of tweets in his name every minute
 1 janvari 2014 ke baad ab tak modi ko lekar 58 million twit hue hai
 11 of it
 8 million twit main modi ko tag kiya gaya
 After March, Modi's popularity increased tremendously
 yahi vajah rahi he modi ke twit ko ritvit karne waalon kii sankhya hajaar, das hajaar paar karti hui chalis hajaar ke paar pahunch gai
 The number of votes i
e
 the number of followers of Modi on the day of 16 May
 87 lakh thi
 Which 40 at the end of the day
 2 lakh tak pahunch gai
 Achieving so many followers in a given time is a record
 twitor par puche gaye sawaalon kaa modi khud hi jawaab dete he, saath hi logon ko diarect massej bhi bhejte hai
 Recently, when the top leaders of the world congratulated him on the victory, Modi himself thanked him through tweets and messages
 twitor ke saath hi narendra modi fasebuk par bhi utane hi sakriy he
 One interesting thing on Modi's page is that there are talkers about him on par with his followers
 16 may ko jeet ke baad daali gai modi kii tasviir ko lakhon likes mili
 Here all the information would be there, from their rallies to events
 twitor or fasebuk ke itar modi kii chhavi takanic ko pasand karne vaale vyakti kii he
 That's why Modi addressed more than 100 rallies at the same time using hologram technology
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi ne yah karnama kai baar kiya
 Modi made a big leap in reaching the people of the country by using this technique in election campaigning
 puri duniya main selfi kaa nayaa trend shuru hua he or narendra modi bhi apni selfi share karne se kataraate nahin he
 Modi's selfie tweeted after voting in Vadodara went viral
 3 hajaar se zyada logon ne use ritvit kiya
 Also, selfie with Modi started trending on Twitter
 lekin modi kii selfi main sabase zyada popular selfi modi or unki maa hira ben kii hui
 Which more than 12 thousand people retweeted
 jabaki 40 hajaar ne logon use favorit bataaya
 But the question is, which phone does Modi have with which he takes his selfie
 cover se dhakaa yah phone yphone 5es he jisase modi apni selfi lete hue aksar khabaron main dikhte he
 Apart from all these things, a lot of games related to Modi have also come in the market
 jise logon ne haathon liya
 Playing online games is also a part of social media
 'modi ran' naam kaa game bhi inamen se ek he
 Which was downloaded by more than 50 thousand people
 is game main modi bharat ke sabhi rajyon main daudte hai
 As many states as Modi runs, he gets as many points
 iske alaava 'modi 272+' bhi he, jo 'modi ran' kii tarah hi he
 At the same time, there is also an angry voter on the lines of Angry Birds
 upila ke is game main arvind kejariwal, rahul gandhi or narendra modi bhi he
 In which the voter chooses their leader according to their own
 ise paanch hajaar logon ne downlod kiya
 Apart from these, there is also a 'chair cricket' game
 is khel main simit khilaadi he
 You can choose your leader from among Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal
 aap jitna score karenge aap ke netaa ko utane hi point milenge
 Very easy to play This game was downloaded by more than 50 thousand people
 2014 ke chunaavon main soshal media ko hathiyaar banaakar modi ne sabit kar diya votaron tak pahunchane main yah kaaphi kargar he
 Perhaps this is the reason why a large proportion of young voters went to his account

 ab tak umradraj netaaon ke panje main rahi himachal pradesh kii congress, ab nai yuva team ke supurd aa gai he
 After the Congress' defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and then the December 2017 assembly elections, the 'formula BJP' was searched to freshen up the organization
 vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ke diggajon ko jis tarah patkhni mili, uske baad sanghathan nai yuva peedi ke hawaale he
 However, most of the older generations have children of old tall leaders
 pradesh ke party adhyaksh sukhwender sukhu ne saamaanya kaaryakartaaon ko tarjeeh dene kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 There is also uneasiness among some party veterans about this
 party kii nai prabhavi rajani patil ne sanghathan kii nakel kas rakhi he
 He has fielded all the leaders, new and old, big or small, against the Modi government
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii haar ko mahaj nau maheene beete hai, lekin congressi kunba jis hanak ke saath sadakon par utar rahaa he, vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye party ke kade tevar kaa sanket karata he
 However, the leadership battle still continues in the party
 party main ab tak purv mukhyamantri virbhadra singh kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 But former Union Minister Anand Sharma has also been trying hard
 2012 ke vidhansabha main jab virbhadra singh ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya, tab anand sharma ke samarthak sukhwender sukhu party adhyaksh bane
 Sukhu kept giving shelter to the team to the new youth in the organization
 ab jab pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congressi mantri yaa phir bordon-nigamon main malaaidaar pad par baithe diggaj haar gaye, tab virbhadra khemaa kamjor pad gaya
 The losers are Kaul Singh and G
 es
 Veterans like Bali were among the contenders for the post of Mukhyamantri
 haalanki chunaav main purv mantri aashaa kumari or mukesh agnihotri ne jeet darj kii thi
 When the Virbhadra camp chose Mukesh as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party, Sukhu as the party president raised his new team in the organization from the district level to the district level
 vahiin virbhadra singh ke bete vikramaditya bhi badi akakshaayen paale hue hai
 He is working to strengthen his roots in the state through cricket
 virbhadra khemaa loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle party adhyaksh ke pad se sukhu ko hatwanaa chahta he
 At the same time, Anand Khema wants to make his pawn sit in such a situation
 lekin jis tarah se sukhu ne sanghathan ko sakriy rakhaa or centre sarkaar par waar kii ranneeti banaai, usase sambhav he ki loksabhaa chunaav unheen kii adhyakshata main ladaa jaae
 Congress is also ready digitally in the state
 usne booth or block str par bhi team banaai he, jise mobile ke jariye joda gaya he
 Instructions are given to the team daily
 teen str par yojana banati he—pehla, sthaneey muddon, pradeshik mudde or teesraa rashtriya mudde
 BJP is attacked on social media by making cartoons and short videos
 vahiin rashtriya str ke muddon kii tasviren-video bhi share hote hai
 Its feedback is taken by the central team
 sukhu bataate hai, ''hamane tay kiya he ki kaaryakarta modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf bolen
 We have held protest rallies on petrol price hike, increased bus fares in the state
 iskaa asar sarkaar par hua he
 We are making the public aware of issues like poor road system
 ''2014 main congress pradesh kii chaaron loksabhaa siton par haar gai thi
 But the Virbhadra family showed a significant effect on the Mandi seat
 is baar mandi se sukhram ne bhaajapa kaa daaman thama he jo virbhadra parivaar ke daanv palatney kaa madda rakhata he
 At the same time, in the Congress Raj, Virbhadra raised big issues of corruption against the BJP
 lekin abhi tak jairam sarkaar ke khilaaf congress ke paas bolne ko kuch bhi nahin he
 However, state spokesperson of Congress Naresh Chauhan says, "we have created many new wings
 kisaan kheti, kaamgaar wing aadi, jinke madhyam main ham logon ke sampark main hai
 We are speaking out against the increasing drug abuse in the state and also on the poor road system
 ''loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress nae logon kii talash main he
 The party president says that an internal survey is going on for this
 mandi se virbhadra ke bete vikramaditya kii hasarat paravaan chadhi he to shanta kumaar kii kaat dhundhi ja rahi he
 Congress is a new face from Shimla, so it wants to give a better candidate to raise Anurag's challenge in Hamirpur
 baharhaal, uski yuva team nae tewaron se las he
 Congress is looking for new faces in Himachal Pradesh in view of Lok Sabha elections *** yo yo hani singh (yo Yo Honey Singh) ab puure 36 saal ke ho gaye hai
 On March 15, he celebrated his 36th birthday with close friends
 hani singh (honey Singh) kaa video internet par kaaphi dhamal machaa rahaa he
 These days he likes to look amazing from the back stage

 This will also increase the chances of blackmailing in the society

 However, it is very important for you to know its legal aspects before performing a sting
 kisi bhi sarkari adhikari yaa karmchaaree ke khilaaf sting se pehle police yaa (anti karpshan branch) ko is bare main bataanaa jaruri he, jisase sting ke makasad par sawaal na uth saken

 JKLF chief Yasin Malik has started a 24-hour hunger strike to pressurize the Indian authorities to hand over the body of Afzal Guru after his hanging in the 2001 Parliament attack in India
 
 afjal ko nai dilli kii ek jail main faansee dene ke baad vahiin dafna diya gaya
 Malik and members of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and jamaat-ud-dawa, on a private tour to meet Afzal's wife and daughter, started a hunger strike outside the National Press Club in the heart of Islamabad

 Malik said, 'afzal Guru's body should be handed over to his family, a peaceful hunger strike is being done for 24 hours on this demand
 parivaar ko uski faansee ke sambandh main jaankaree bhi nahi di gai he
 ' aisa mana ja rahaa he ki afjal ke parivaar ne adhikariyon se aagrah kiya tha ki subah nai dilli ke tihaad jail main faansee dene ke baad afjal kaa antim sanskaar islamic tareeke se karne kii anumati den
 The comments malik ne kaha, ‘afjal raajnneeti kaa shikaar hua he jo aagaamee chunaav (bharat main agle varsh hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav) ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that incidents like hanging Afzal would anger the youth of Jammu and Kashmir who have adopted non-violent methods of protest
 malik ne kaha ki vah kisi ke liye bhi faansee kii sajaa kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 He said that we are completely against capital punishment
 ham kabhi bhi sarbajit yaa kisi or ko faansee dene kii maang nahin karenge

 paigambar mohammad kaa janm arab ke registan ke shahar makka main 570 isvi main hua tha

 inke pita kaa naam abdullah or mata kaa naam bibi aamina tha
 2

 kaha jaataa he ki vah bakriyon kaa doodh bhi duhate the or apane kapade bhi khud dhulate the

 bataaya jaataa he ki paigambar mohammad ne kaha tha ki jo bhi unki tasviir banayega, use allaah sajaa degaa
 5
 paigambar mohammad islam ke sabase mahaan nabi or aakhri paigambar hai
 According to the Quran, one night while he was meditating in a cave in the mountain, the angel came to Jibrail and taught him the Quran
 6
 Mohammed began to read the message as Jibrail mentioned Allah’s name
 allaah kaa sandesh maanakar paigambar mohammad jindagi bhar ise doharaate rahe
 His words were memorized and stored
 7
 The Prophet believed that Allah had chosen him as their messenger, so he started giving the message of Allah to others as well
 8
 Mohammed's popularity increased so much that influential people in Mecca began to feel threatened

 Rajasthan BJP chief Madan Lal Saini is being trolled for misrepresenting history
 saini ke mutabik humayun or babar ke bich bhi gaay ko lekar charchaa hui thi
 According to Saini, when the Mughal emperor Humayun was on the deathbed, he called Babur and said that if you rule India, then take care of three things
 gaay, brahman or mahila
 They should not be insulted
 hindustan inako sahan nahin karata he
 These should be respected
 saini kaa soshal media par isliye makhul uda ja rahaa he ki babar kii mrityu pehle hui thi
 Humayun died in 1556 after 25 years
 kya bijepi netaa ne jo kaha wo puri tarah galat tha? india today kii fact check team ne mughalon se jude lekh-dastavej khangaal kar or itihaaskaaron se baat kar ye jaanane kii koshish ki us vakt gaayon ko lekar kya niti thi?itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he kiseni ne shaayad 17veen sadi kii kitabjise babar kii ‘vasaaya’ (yaa vasietnama) bataaya gaya, ke hawaale se ye baat kahi
 Experts say that the book mentions Babur's warning to son Humayun against cow slaughter
 lekin kitaab ko lekar saath hi chetavanee he ki wo farji he
 Both Babur and Humayun remained active in the 16th century, while the alleged 'vasaya' was said to have come during the reign of Shah Jahan
 visheshgyon ke mutabik ye kitaab isiilie laai gai jisase gohatya par purna pratibandh lagane ke liye adhik samarthan jutaya ja sake, ye hawala dekar ki mughalon ke shashan kii shuruyaat main bhi ye pratibandh lagu tha
 According to historians, there is no mention of cow slaughter in Babur's biography 'tujuk-e-babri'
 isamen sirf ye kaha gaya he ki gaay ko bharat main pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is not clear from this that the Mughal emperor had completely banned cow slaughter
 babar ke putr humayun kaa shashan bada uthal-puthal vaala tha
 Humayun's biography 'humayunama' also has no direct reference to cow slaughter
 yadhyapi badshaah ke ek khidmatgaar johar kii kitaab ‘tezkereh-al-vakiyat’ main mughalon ke nijee sansmaranon kaa zikr he
 It was translated by Major Charles Stuart of the British East India Company
 isamen gaay ke sawaal par raushnee daali gai he
 Jauhar has mentioned an incident in which Humayun had clearly opposed cow slaughter
 kitaab main kaha gaya he ki humayun kii ore se kabul shahar se vidrohi bhai kamran ko khadedane ke baad raat ke khaane main gomance parosa gaya tha
 According to the book, the king refused to eat it
 kitaab main humayun ko ye kehete uddhrut kiya gaya he- oh badanaseeb kamran! kya ye tumhaare jeene kaa tarika tha? or kya tumne gaayon ke maance se pakizgi kii panaahagaah ko khilaayaa?
 
 
 This food is also not suitable for those who wait at the grave of our father
 kya ham, unke chaar putr, unki nishaani kaa sammaan nahin kar sakate the?haalanki itihaaskaar british adhikari ke anuwaad kii kshamta par shaq jataate hai lekin tab bhi paryaapt sanket he ki shuruaati mughal badshaah gohatya or gomance khaane ke khilaaf the
 There was a strict ban on cow slaughter during Akbar's tenure
 iskaa paalan unke bete jahangir or pote shahjahan ne bhi kiya
 It is well known that Emperor Aurangzeb took a hardline stance against Hindus
 je gordan melton ne apni kitaab ‘feths across time : 5,000 ears of rilijiyas history’ main likhaa he ki ek jain mandir ko apavitra karne ke baad aurangzeb ne parisar main ek gaay kii hatya karai thi
 Experts, however, suspect that Aurangzeb may have lifted the ban on cow slaughter on behalf of his ancestors
 mughal kaal main aage chalakar bhi pratibandh ko lekar dastaveji hawaale milte hai
 Even during the rule of Emperor Farrukh Sier, there is written evidence of a trial in the royal court on charges of cow slaughter
 aise ullekh bhi hai ki bakreed par pratibandh main chhot di jaati thi
 It is clear from the fact check that what the BJP leader said while citing fake documents was factually incorrect
 lekin saath hi ye bhi sthapit tathy he ki mughal kaal main gohatya par sakht pratibandh tha

 aatankwaadiyon or unka panaahagaah pakistan ke khilaaf bhartiya sena kii sargical strike ko ek saal puraa hone ja rahaa he
 On this occasion, where Pakistan is plotting to carry out its nefarious acts, India is busy preparing and strengthening itself
 vahiin bharat kii janata chaahati he ki bhartiya sena har us aatanki ko jameen ke neeche bhej de jisane bhi ajtak hindustan ko koon ke aansu rulaae hai
 Be it Mumbai attack in 1993 or Uri attack last year
 lekin ab vaqt aa gaya he, inke gunahon kaa hisaab karne kaa
 In such a situation, we are telling the names of those terrorists who are continuously flourishing in the shadow of Pakistan, the enemy of India
 saboot bataate hai ki ye sabhi ke sabhi ab bhi pakistan main hi chhipe baithe hai
 In such a situation, there is a need and surgical strike, so that India's enemies are wiped out in one stroke
 aaie jaanate hai ab kinako PAK main ghus kar maarane kii jarurat he?pichley saal ek sargical strike or 38 dehshatgardon samet chalis se zyaada dushman halaak
 After the Uri attack, the wound which was burning in the heart of India was continuously burning and went cold after ten whole days

 Hopefully, now even the remaining enemies will not survive

 Thane Police Commissioner Parambir Singh said that Iqbal has told him that India's most wanted Dawood lives in Karachi, Pakistan
 uske vahaan chaar bangale hai
 The Mumbai blasts of 1993, the first such terrorist attack, put Pakistan directly in the dock
 uske baad se to pichley 23 saalon main ye silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 Don't know how many cities of India got injured and shattered
 par pakistan ke raste hindustan aane vaala aatank band nahin hua
 In fact, the army and the ISI have been more responsible for making Pakistan the base of terror than the government there
 daaud 1993 ke mumbai dhamaake ke baad se hi pakistan fouj or iesai kaa kaa chaheta bana hua he
 Enemy number 2 Hafiz Saeedthiq likewise Hafiz Saeed also runs a panic shop under different names, living in the area of murid, Pakistan
 aapako bataa den ki sargical strike ke baad se hi dar se hafiz said ne apane adde badal die hai
 Hafiz Saeed is hiding among people in dense settlements to save his life
 bharat ke sargical strike or international pressure kaa hi asar he ki pakistan ab khulkar haafiz said kaa saath nahin de paa rahaa he
 According to sources, authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have extended the detention of Hafiz Saeed for a month
 paak kaa kahana he ki uski gatividhiyaan desh main shanti ke liye khatra he
 Please tell that the chief of jamaat-ud-dawa, Saeed is under house arrest since January 31 of this year
 hafiz said ke saath punjab grih vibhaag ne uske chaar saathi abdulla ubeda, malik jafar ikbaal, abdul rahamaan aabid or kaaji kashif hossain kii najarbandi 25 sitambar ke prabhaav se 30 din ke liye badha di he
 Significantly, there were reports recently that jamaat-ud-dawa, the organization of the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, Hafiz Saeed, is independent in Pakistan and is planning to contest elections in Pakistan
 aise main bharat ke logon ko intjaar he ki bhartiya sena sargical strike kar mumbai hamalon kaa badla jarur legi
 Enemy number 3 Masood Azhar Bahawalpur is running a terror shop from Pakistan's enemy number three ie Masood Azhar from Pakistan in the name of madrasas
 bhartiya fouj ke jaanbaaj commando ne bas zaraa sa trailor hi dikhaaya tha ki pakistan main baithe bharat ke dushmano ke paseene chhot gaye
 Masood Azhar is also residing at the new base after the surgical strike
 sutron ke mutabik ab haafiz said or masood donon apane-apane madrason or sanghathan ke headquarter se dur kuch chuninda gurgon ke saath ghani aabaadi ke bich rahane chale gaye hai
 Their thinking behind this is that it is more secure to live among the densely populated
 pathankot hamale ke master mind or aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar par pratibandh lagane kii koshishon par china ke lagaataar lagate vito se sarkaar is masale par nae tareeke talash rahi he
 India certainly has the option of a surgical strike to avenge the Pathankot attack and to rein in terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed
 osama kii tarah ho inkaa khatmatankwaadi osama bin laden ko america navy sil ne uske ghar main ghus kar maaraa tha

e
 Dawood Ibrahim, Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar

 loksabhaa main guuruuvaar ko sadhvi pragna thakur par hua hangaamacongress ne sadhvi pragna thakur ke bayaan par kiya hangaamaraksha mantri rajnath singh ne us bayaan par di party kii safiguruuvaar ko loksabhaa main bhopal se bijepi saansad sadhvi pragna thakur dwaara nathuram godse ko deshbhakt kahe jane vaale bayaan par kaaphi hangaamaa hua
 The Congress tried to corner both the government and the BJP on this issue
 sadan ke samaksh is par raksha mantri rajnath singh ne party kaa paksh rakhaa lekin unke safai dene ke baad bhi congress santusht nahin hui or congress saansad sadan se walk out kar gaye
 As soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started in the Lok Sabha, the opposition started a ruckus
 jis dauraan asana divangton ko shradhanjali gyaapit kar rahaa tha us vakt bhi congress ke saansad charchaa kar rahe the jis par loksabhaa adhyaksh om birla ne aapatti jataai or kaha ki jab kisi ke nidhan kii baat ho rahi ho to kisi ko baat nahin kerani chahie yah sadan kii garima ko chot pahunchaata he
 After this, Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary created a ruckus on the statement made by Sadhvi Pragya Thakur in Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 unhone kaha ki congress ko tebrist party kehete hai
 The party that made the sacrifice
 rashtrapita kii hatya karne vaale ko deshbhakt kehete hai, kya sadan chup rahegaa
 You want to usurp Indira Gandhi
 pandit nehru ko hadapna chaahate hai
 Now we are grabbing Mahatma Gandhi
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ne nahin di bahes kii anumaticongress saansadon ko tonkate hue loksabhaa adhyaksh om birla ne kaha ki sadhvi pragna thakur kaa bayaan sadan kii kaarywahi main shaamil nahin tha
 When he is not in action, he cannot be discussed
 aap baahar kuch bhi kah sakate hai sadan main us par bahes nahin hogi, maine vyavastha de di he
 Anything spoken outside cannot be debated
 rajnath bole- hamaari party khandan karti hehangamaa badhata dekh raksha mantri rajnath singh ne loksabhaa main apni party kaa paksh rakhane kii koshish kii
 The Defense Minister said that if there is any thought to consider Nathuram Godse as a patriot, our party refutes it
 nathuram godse ko jo deshbhakt maanate hai hamaari party is soch ke khilaaf he
 Far from calling Godse a patriot, it is condemnable to think
 mahatma gandhi ko sab apana adarsh maanate hai
 The Congress did a clean job of the defense minister in the walk out meeting
 jis vakt ve bol rahe the us vakt bhi vipaksh lagaataar hangaamaa kar rahaa tha
 The Lok Sabha speaker also interrupted the opposition many times that the Deputy Leader of the House is speaking, you should listen but unhappy with the statement of the Defense Minister, the Congress MP walked out of the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main bhi nahin hui sadhvi pragna thakur ke bayaan par bahasarajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ne sadan main sadhvi pragna ke bayaan par charchaa karne kii apil kii thi jise sabhapati ne yah kehete hue naamanzoor kar diya ki vah bayaan duusare sadan main diya gaya tha
 Sadhvi Pragya had told Godse that during the debate related to SPG bill in Lok Sabha on Thursday, Pragya Singh Thakur called Nathuram Godse a patriot
 jis par pehle sansad ke bheetar or baad main baahar kaaphi hangaamaa hua
 However, the Speaker had made it clear at the same time that the statement of MP Thakur would not be a part of the proceedings of the Lok Sabha

 Not only this, Rahul Gandhi also said that Modi ji kept the 'garbage' from our party and threw it out in BJP
 road sho main rahul gandhi ne ye bhi kaha ki maine harish ravat ji se bhrasht logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat kahi he
 During Rahul's roadshow, three of Rahul's Saawrahul Gandhi said that BJP workers are also present here and i ask them three questions
 pehla sawaal:modi ji kehete hai ki wo kalaadhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hai to phir modi ji ne un bhrasht netaaon ko tikat kyon die jo congress chhodkar bijepi main gaye
 Second question: Why did Modi ji give only 5% of the minimum sale price to the farmers
 teesraa sawaal:main yahaan maujuud bijepi kaaryakartaaon se poochna chahta hum ki kya unke khaaton main 15 lakh rupye aa gaye hai
 Instead of bringing more than ninety percent of the black money that is abroad in the form of real estate and gold, why is Modi running behind 6 percent of the country's cash

 On the indo-pak problem, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today that 'lack of confidence' is the biggest problem in improving bilateral relations between the two countries
 samprag do sarkaar ke ek varsh puraa hone ke maukey par yojit samvaadadaata sammelan main manmohan singh ne kaha ki bharat sabhi lambit maamalon par pakistan se baat karnaa chahta he, lekin iske liye pakistan ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki uski jameen kaa upyog aatankwaad ke liye na ho
 On the talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries, he said that India will do its best to improve relations between the two countries which have been bitter since the terrorist attack in Mumbai in November 2008
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘meraa yah prayaas he ki donon deshon ke bich matbhed kisi tarah ke samarpan yaa hamaare mahatvapurn rashtriya hit ko prabhavit kiye bina kam kiye jaae
 He said that he believes that there can be no progress from the composite dialogue between the two countries, as there is a lack of trust between the two countries
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘paryaapt vishwaas kii kami he or vishwaas kii kami sabase badi samasya he
 "we want to discuss all pending matters with Pakistan," he said
 lekin use yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki uski jameen kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad ke liye nahin ho
 Singh also expressed hope that the new dialogue process would proceed
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pakistan hamaara padosi he
 i believe that India cannot achieve its full development potential without developing excellent relations with its neighbors and Pakistan is our largest neighbor
 ’’ Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar once again demanded the Central Government to grant special status to the state

 Regarding this, the Bihar government says that the foundation stone of many schemes such as patna-buxar road has been done in the year 2012 itself and this road is being re-laid only for looting accolades

 noida main hue bahucharchit aarushi murder cese par aadhaarit he film 'rahasy', jisamen katl kii gai bacchee aesha kii bhoomika nibhaai he sakshi saim ne, ashish vidhyaarthee or tiska chopra doctor maa-baap ke kirdaar main hai tathaa keke menon bane hai sibiai officer, jo aesha ke katl kii tafteesh kar rahe hai
 The disclaimer has been introduced at the start of 'rahasya', according to which it is a fictional story
 tafteesh ke tareeke kii taraf dekhen to yah disclemur sahi ho saktaa he, magar 'rahasy' kii kahani dekhen to saaf pataa chalata he ki film puri tarah aarushi hatyakand par hi aadhaarit he
 Like Aarushi's parents, Aisha's parents are also doctors
 aarushi ke naukar hemraj kii tarah aesha ke naukar kaa bhi khun hota he
 Even the secrets of the kind of relationship that were heard in the Aarushi murder case, many similar secrets are also shown in this film
 jis tarah aarushi ke katl ke aarope main uske mata-pita jail main hai, film main bhi koi apana hi he, lekin vah apana koun he, iske liye aapako film dekhni hogi
 Yes, during the promotion of 'rahasya', the actors also confessed that the film is based on the Aarushi murder case
 ek baat kehani hogi ki nirdeshak manish gupta ne film ko engeging rakhaa he
 The suspense is good and the first half is particularly tight
 tafteesh ko achche twist die gaye hai or ashish vidhyaarthee or keke menon ne acha abhinay kiya he
 But the second part of the film feels a bit stretched, and the climax opens up a lot more easily
 agar aap murder mistry dekhnaa pasand karte hai, to ek baar 'rahasy' dekh sakate hai, kyonki aarushi murder cese kaa faisla jaanate hue bhi is film main aap boriyat mahasoos nahin karenge
 My rating for this film is - 3 stars

 pehla shaq- mangetar amit paratvinkal dagare amit kii mangetar thi or amit badanaavar kaa hi rahane vaala tha jahaan tvinkal kii aakhri mobile lokation tres hui thi
 So the first person went to Amit
 police ne chaanbin kii to pataa chalaa ki 15 oktober ke baad uski naa to tvinkal se baat hui or naa hi wo usase mila
 The police returned to Bearang from Badnavar
 
 Second suspicion - when parents Parpulis started to find out about Twinkle closely, it came to know that she was upset with her own parents and she had filed a complaint in the police station several times
 magar maa-baap se poochtacha ke baad police ko andaaza ho gaya ki tvinkal kii gumshudagi main unka koi haath nahin
 But the police definitely got a new information from the parents
 pataa chalaa ki tvinkal ek sthaneey bijepi netaa or purv mahaamantri jagadish karotiyaa ke kaaphi kareeb thi
 Twinkle's parents often scolded him for this
 teesraa shaq- bijepi netaa jagadish karotiyaa parchunki tvinkal college se hi chaatr raajnneeti main bahut aage thi
 And he had an inclination towards BJP
 lihaaza bijepi ke netaa or purv mahaamantri jagadish karotiyaa se uskaa milanaa julna shuru hua
 But 65-year-old Jagdish was seen in Twinkle rather than seeing the future of the country
 jald hi wo tvinkal ke kareeb aa gaye
 Twinkle also got into her bluff
