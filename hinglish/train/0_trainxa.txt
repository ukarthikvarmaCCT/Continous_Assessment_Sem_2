 ' Chennai Super Kings should be banned as per IPL laws
 spot phixing ke maamle main bisisiai ke sabhi adhikariyon ko jimmedaari leni chahie or is tarah kii phixing ko rokane ke liye kade kadam uthaane chahie
 This was said by BJP MP and former Test cricketer Kirti Azad in Aaj Tak's direct talk program
 kirti aaazaad ne kaha ki agar wo dhoni kii jagah hote to ipel kaa final kisi bhi haal main nahin khelte
 When asked if Dhoni should take a stand that the team owner has been caught, he too should not stay in the Chennai Super King
 is sawaal par kirti aaazaad ne kaha- ‘ye to aapako dhoni se poochna chahie ki unka dil kya kahata he par unki jagah main hota to main nahin kheltaa, main kahata mujhe nahin chahie paise, jitne kamaane the kama liye, mujhe maaf kiijie, main ye nahin kar saktaa
 And now it will be seen what the sub committee of IPL does, they have to take the biggest decision whether this team should be fed under IPL law
 ’kya bisisiai ne jo jaanch cametiyaan banaai hai wo kisi nishkarsh par pahunchengi? kyonki use vahi log chalaa rahe hai jo is puri gadabadi main shaamil hai
 On this, Kirti Azad said- 'this happened first in 2009 in South Africa
 uske baad ek board cameti bani, jisaki report pichley chaar saal se kisi ke saamne nahin ai
 In the report given by the Yashwant Sinha Committee, constituted by the government, in 2010, it was said that there is a lot of fraud within the IPL
 usamen femaa kaa ulanghan hua
 Violations of FBI, RBI occurred
 jiske tahat 1 hajaar 8 karod rupee desh se baahar le jaae gaye
 Those who were government employees got punishment, but even today they are sitting in BCCI
 kyon wo report abhi tak saamne nahin ai
 In response to a question, Kirti Azad said- 'when the CBI report came in 1999, the players banned life time
 lekin is baar aapane khilaadiyon ko keval suspend bhar kiya
 The message went well at that time and that is why there was no disturbance till 2000-2008
 kya saare anushaasan keval khilaadiyon ke liye hi hai
 Why not this discipline for officers or why not over BCCI officials? Who has transparency, accountability and responsibility? The cricketer is then sold for 50 lakhs
 apana jameer 50 lakh ke liye bech detaa he
 The people ahead of him earn 5 crores, 50 crores, 500 crores and 5,000 crores, but the gorakhandha is happening in front of the eyes
 use rokane ke liye kyon kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa
 'should leaders say goodbye to cricket and only professional and former players should run cricket? To this, Kirti Azad replied - 'professional management associations run the game all over the world but this is not the case in India
 aaj indian olympic association kii manyata radd kar di gai he
 In view of this situation, BCCI should also be derecognised
 lekin nahin ho paati kyonki isisi ko 80 fisadi paisa hindustan se hi jaataa he
 So they are afraid to do something themselves
 naam to unka narsimha he, lekin bina daant or bina nakhun kaa
 Will that poor person kill anyone, is the ICC to say that they get the T20, World Cup and the Champions Trophy and they are happy about it
 baaki kamai to use bisisiai se ho hi jaati he isliye wo kuch nahin bolta
 'so should the IPL be discontinued until the whole matter is resolved? Kirti Azad, answering this question, said- 'why should the game stop, the game is the same
 jo khilne vaale hai or jo khilaane vaale yani association main jo log baithe hai ye unki jimmedaari he
 Today people who are sitting in BCCI, messing up, keep hiding each other, are political people, maintain their reputation and because of their reputation they say that go to dust and its shirt is my shirt
 Should not be more white than ’kya bisisiai pramukh en
 Srinivasan should resign
 is sawaal par kirti aaazaad ne kaha- ‘kitnon kaa istipha lenge
 N
 shrinivasana ko ye baat nahin kerani chahie ki mayppan kaa team se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 When it is revealed that they had a pass to go everywhere, only the dressing room
 ham shrinivasana par ja rahe hai lekin unke peeche bhi kai log he jo peeche se khelte hai
 The Mahabharata took place between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, but Shakuni maternal uncle also sat behind them
 jinhone ladaai karwaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 When Rahul Kaval asked him that the law of BCCI and IPL only says that the owner of any team is caught in any wrong activity, then that team should be banned
 to kya chennai super king ko bhi bain kar dena chahie? is par kirti aaazaad ne kaha- ‘bilkul, niyamon ke anusaar bain kar dena chahie
 'when he was asked whether on the basis of morality, Rajiv Shukla should resign, taking responsibility also? On this, Kirti Azad said - 'his resignation is made later, before that the question of the Displanatory Committee is made
 or usase bhi pehle banataa he legal cell kaa, jinhone aise kanoon kyon pehle nahin banaae
 'so you are saying that Arun Jaitley should resign first and Rajiv Shukla later? Because they have failed to stop the mess in the IPL
 is par kirti aaazaad ne kaha- ‘agar sahi vakt par dawa de di jaati to marij batch jaataa
 If radio therapy was done earlier, the tumor would not turn into cancer, but today it has turned into cancer and the doctors who are responsible for this should be fined
 un logon par bhi jin logon ne kadai se kaarywahi nahin kii, kanoon nahin banaae
 Action should be done within 24 hours of cricket disturbances
 is khel main aap intjaar nahin kar sakate
 Asad Rauf also faced some charges last year
 tab kuch nahin kiya
 This time too, the entire game was over when two matches were left, so that they do not let them play the match
 isisi ne yahaan dogali baat kii
 How much Assad must have done in such a time
 khilaadiyon ko suspend kar do, bain kar do, ye aasaan he par gadabad karne vaale adhikariyon par kaarywahi karnaa aasaan nahin
 By the way, Kirti Azad also suggested several names for the BCCI Presindate, who not only know cricket closely but are also honest according to them
 kirti azaad ne kaha- ‘kai aise log he jo eemaandaar he, cricket kii sunate hai par main unka naam lene se darataa hum ki kahin unke saath kuch galat naa ho, par shashaank manohar ek behtareen insaan he, sanjay jagadale cricket ko bahut kareeb se jaanate he
 These are some of the names that have given time and respect to cricket

 Shamika Ravi, Chief Economist Rupa Purushottam of Tata Sons, Dr
 Ritu Dewan, Vice President of the Indian Society of Labor Economics, expressed their opinion on the current state of the economy
 shamika ravi ne jahaan bhartiya arthvyavastha ko avasar bataaya vahiin ritu dewan ne mandi ke halaat ko rekhaankit kiya

 Although Ritu Dewan praised the Ujjwala scheme of the Modi government, he said that people should have the ability to buy bread and bread first
 ujjwala yojana ke tahat logon ko silendar or gas chulhaa mil gaya, lekin unke paas use dobaaraa bharaane ke liye paise nahin the
 Similarly, a lot of budget has been spent on the Clean India Mission, while every man has a basic understanding of cleanliness

 chini fouj ladakh main bhartiya jameen se peeche hat gai
 Without convincing India, India convinced China to retreat
 ravivaar shaam jab yah khabar ai to vivaad sulajhane par har kisi ne raahat kii saans lee
 However, it is now reported that China did not give up its stubbornness, but in persuading it, India had to agree to remove the strategically important post
 20 din baad chini fouj bhartiya seemaa ke 19 kilometre bheetar purvi ladakh ke daulat beg oldy se hatane ko raji ho gai lekin, china se jhagada sulajhane se desh main jitani khushi he, utani hi chintaaen bhi hai
 Questions are arising that how did the stubborn China agree? Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah had also expressed his concern on Monday, "the only suspicion is that the media reports said that both sides were back
" bharat or china peeche hate
 i am amazed about where India was removed and where India was to move because it is our region, it is our region of the Line of Actual Control

 Both forces will return to the place where they were before 15 April
 ' iske baad bagaiyr koi khulaasa kiye yahi baat somvaar ko videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa akbaruddin ne bhi doharaai
 In such a situation, these doubts are being strengthened whether China has agreed to reconcile in view of the proposed Prime Minister's visit to India from May 20? If sources are to be believed, China has retreated after charging a big price
 sutron kaa kahana he ki chini fouj ladakh se isi shart par hatane ko raji hui ki bharat chumaar se apana post hataa legaa
 In fact, from the Chumar posts in East Ladakh, Indian troops keep an eye on the movements of the Chinese highway
 china bahut pehle se bharat se chumaar kaa forward objarveshan post hataane kii maang karata rahaa he
 It is clear that what the government is calling a diplomatic victory has paid a big price

 sikh shraddhaluon kii aasthaa ke ahm sthalon main se ek kartarpur sahib ke liye bharat or pakistan ne coridor banane kaa elaan kiya he, lekin pakistan phir bhi apni napak harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa
 The Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan was announced to build a corridor for easy and unhindered movement of Sikh devotees
 lekin buudhvaar shaam ko hi pakistan ne bhartiya rajanyikon ko nankana sahib gurudwara main pravesh karne se roak diya
 Similarly, diplomats were prevented from visiting the Sauda Sauda Gurudwara on Thursday morning
 bharat ne islamabad main bhartiya ucchayog ke adhikariyon ko kathith taur par pareshaan karne or pakistan main bhartiya sikh shraddhaluon ko yatra kii anumati se inkaar karne par shuukravaar ko pakistan ke samaksh virodh darj karaayaa
 According to the Foreign Ministry, the diplomatic officers of the Indian High Commission were harassed and were not allowed to meet Indian devotees at Gurdwara Nankana Saheb and Gurdwara Sacha Sauda on November 21 and 22
 mantralay ke bayaan main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ke videsh mantralay se purv main yatra anumati milane ke baavjood unhen vahaan jane nahin diya gaya
 Please tell that in the past, on such occasions, the case of Indian diplomats was seen by the Pakistani security officer
 lekin is baar khalistaan samarthak gopal singh chawla kii dekharekh main sab ho rahaa tha
 Chawla is considered close to the notorious terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 guuruuvaar subah bhartiya ucchayog se jude do adhikari ranjit singh or sunil kumaar gurudwara sachcha sauda pahunche
 Both officers also entered the gurdwara
 lekin jaise hi chawla or uske gurgey gurudware pahunche, donon bhartiya rajanyikon ko apmanjanak dhang se gurudwara parisar se baahar jane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 Pakistan has cited security reasons behind the denial of Indian diplomats to Sikh holy sites
 in rajanyikon ko bhartiya sikh shraddhaluon se milane kaa mauka bhi nahin diya jaataa
 India has expressed deep concern over the news that has sparked communal disharmony and intolerance and promoted separatism during Indian pilgrims' visit to Pakistan
 india today kii pahunch main aisi tasviren or video hai jinamein pakistan ke gurudwaron ke aasapaas khalistaan samarthak poster or bannron ko lage dekha ja saktaa he
 Please tell that on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the Government of Pakistan has given permission to 3800 Sikh devotees from India to visit the Gurdwaras in Pakistan
 pakistan main bhartiya rajanyikon se jaisaa bartaav kiya gaya, usase thik ulat haal main bharat ne pakistani ucchayukta sohail mahmud kaa tab garmjoshi se swaagat kiya, jab wo 144 pakistani shraddhaluon ke saath sarhind main salanaa urs main hissaa lene gaye the
 Then he visited the tomb of Sheikh Farooqui Sirhindi (mujadid Alf Sani) and bowed
 dharmik sthalon kii yatra ko lekar bharat-pakistan protocol,1974 ke mutabik donon deshon par har saal aisi dharmik tirth yatraaen karaane kii jimmedaari he
 On Friday, the Foreign Ministry said that it has asked Pakistan to take all such steps to prevent the propaganda against India and at the same time put strong rein on the advocates of separatism
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kaa aupchaarik elaan abhi nahin hua he, par siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi hai
 Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is the face of the Congress in the state and in the coming days he has to face the BJP in the electoral battle
 duusari ore piem narendra modi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main aisi siyaasi pich taiyaar karte hai ki muqabla kshetreey netaa banaam modi ke ird gird simat jaataa he or isamen apane kad or lokapriyata ke chalate modi baaji maar le jate hai
 But the scenario of Karnataka is in reverse, here Siddaramaiah himself is trying to surround BJP with Modi's bets
 siddharmaiya ke is trep se bijepi baichaiyn he
 In Siddaramaiah's trap, BJP is actually attacking top BJP leaders one after the other under a thoughtful strategy
 badale main bijepi kaa kendriya netritv bhi javaabi hamale kar rahaa he
 Siddaramaiah first targeted UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, then party president Amit Shah and now directly Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone ek angreji akhbaar ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha ki piem narendra modi lokapriy jarur hai, par loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kiye apane vaadon ko puraa nahin kar sake hai
 Siddaramaiah and Amit Shah face-to-face Siddaramaiah had earlier called BJP President Amit Shah 'unintelligent' and 'X jail bird' (who had already gone to jail)
 itnaa hi nahin unhone isse pehle bijepi, sangh or bajrang dal ke logon ko aatankwaadi tak kaha tha
 The CM of Karnataka has been consistently making such remarks on the BJP central leadership
 siddharmaiya ko bijepi kii sthaneey ikai ke alaava kendriya netritv bhi jawaab de rahaa he
 Amit Shah said that Siddaramaiah government has crossed all the boundaries of corruption, Siddaramaiah and corruption are synonyms
 bahari banaam sthaneey banane kii jugatmukhyamantri siddharmaiya apane upar bijepi ke aalaa netaaon dwaara ho rahe siyaasi hamale ko bahari banaam sthaneey kaa mudda banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Siddaramaiah is presenting the criticism of the state government by BJP leaders as a personal attack on himself
 siddharmaiya in hamalon ke jariye karnataka main ye sandesh de rahe hai ki aagaamee chunaav main muqabla karnataka ke siddharmaiya banaam bijepi ke dilli main baithe aalaa netaa he
 With this, Siddaramaiah is expected to benefit from Karnataka pride
 khud bijepi kii rajya ikai bhi is khel ko samaj rahi he
 On behalf of the party, CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa has also warned his top leaders about this
 kannada gaurav kaa cheharaa banane kaa plangauratlab he ki dakshin bharat kii siyasat main kshetreeyata ek mudda hameshaa se rahaa he
 Siddaramaiah understands this very well
 wo jaanate hai ki agar muqabla unke or bijepi ke dilli main baithe netaaon kaa hoga to wo kannada gaurav kaa cheharaa ban sakate hai or logon ko unki bhashaa main samajhakar unhen apane paksh main laa sakate hai
 They do not want Siddaramaiah vs Yeddyurappa to contest in Karnataka, if this happens, the issue of the election will not be of regionalism or language but of the functioning and corruption of the government, in which Siddaramaiah will have to suffer the loss of anti-incumbency
 yediurppa kashmakash menkarnataka main bijepi ke cheharaa bi es yediurppa chaahate the ki unki parivartan yatra ke dauraan rajya sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko ujagar karke bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan kii uplabdhiyon ko saamne laane par focus kiya jaae
 Not only this, he was wishing that anti-incumbency should be made an issue
 par usase pehle hi siddharmaiya ne hindu aatankwaad jaise mudde ko hawa di or bijepi netaaon kii pratikriya se yahi khabaron main chaaya rahaa
 Modi's 2014 formulaedurappa was wishing that the way PM candidate during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi was just talking about development, making the anti-incumbency trend against Congress a big issue
 vahi formula karnataka main bhi lagu kiya jaae lekin siddharmaiya piem modi ke gujarat chunaav main chale gaye daanv ko apana hathiyaar banaakar baithe hai
 Like Modi, he is trying to connect with people in the local language, calling BJP leaders as outsiders, as in Gujarat, PM Modi had named Rahul Gandhi as an outsider and himself a son of Gujarat
 ek desh ek kanoon kii sanak kaa kya haal hota he uski misaal he naagarikta bill
 When this law is enacted, it will not be implemented in one way in all parts of the country
 purvottar main hi yah kanoon kai saare agar magar ke saath lagu ho rahaa he
 The British law of 1873 has been resorted to in order not to apply in Manipur
 vahaan pehali baar inner line permit lagu hoga
 Now Indians will be able to go to Manipur with a permit
 iske baad bhi manipur main is kanoon ko lekar jashn nahin he
 The call of the student organization NESO has also impacted there
 arunachal pradesh, mizoram or nagaland main yah kanoon lagu nahin hoga
 Shall not apply in those parts of Assam and Tripura where the Autonomous Council functions under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution
 sikkim main lagu nahin hoga kyonki vahaan anuchhed 371 kii vyavastha he
 The country is like this
 alag alag bhugolic kshetron ke liye alag kanoon kii zarurat padati he
 Not only India, this is the history and current of laws around the world
 ek desh ke bheetar kahin kanoon bhugolic kaarnon se alag hota he to kahin saamudayik kaarnon se
 The administrative structures are also different due to these requirements
 lekin kashmir ko lekar hindi pradeshon kii soch kund kar di gai
 Hindi newspapers and Hindi channels fooled the people of Hindi states that the absence of one country and one law in Kashmir is the biggest reason for the crisis
 ab vahi hindi akhbaar or hindi channel aapako ek desh ek kanoon par lacture nahin de rahe hai or na koi grahamantri yaa pradhanmantri se sawaal kar rahaa he
 Everyone knows that the public is not educated
 jo padhi likhi he wo bhakthi main magan he to jo ji chaahe bol kar nikal jaao
 Look at the Hindi newspapers
 kya unamem purvottar kii chintaaen or andolan kii khabaren hai? kyon aapako jaanane se roka ja rahaa he? aap jaan jaaenge to kya ho jayega? kyonki hindi akhbaar nahin chaahate ki hindi pradeshon kaa nagirak sakasham bane
 You will study the impact of this mass murder in Hindi newspapers and accept my point
 akhabaaron kaa jhund hindi ke garib or mehanatakash nagirakon ke vivek hi hatya kar rahaa he
 Even now you look at your newspapers for a minute and if possible tear them and throw them away
 hindustan akhbaar ne likhaa he ki naagarikta vidheyak par antim agnipariksha aaj
 The bill is to be introduced in the Rajya Sabha and a major Hindi newspaper writes Agni Pariksha
 aap agnipariksha jaanate hai
 The bill that is being lied about, which does not have any problem in passing, will it also be put under fire? sutron ke mutabik ipel main spot phixing ke maamle main giraftaar kiye gaye rajasthan royles ke cricketer ajit chandila ne police kii poochtacha main bataaya he ki ipel−5 main 29 april, 2012 ko dilli or rajasthan royles ke bich khelaa gaya match bhi fiks tha

 yaad dilaa den ki elahabaad hoicourt ne vivaadit bhoomi ke malikana haq ko lekar apana faisla de diya
 If that decision was not approved, then Sunni Waqf Board also came to Supreme Court and Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust and Nirmohi Arena also came to Supreme Court
 aisa nahin tha ki sirf sunni vakf board or ram janmabhumi trust aamane-saamne the balki ram janmabhumi trust or nirmohi akhaada bhi aapas main alag-alag daawey kar rahe the
 In 2011, the Supreme Court granted a stay
 chah saal tak sarvocch nyaayalay main yah maamla rengta rahaa
 There has been a 40-day debate since August 6
 paanch jajon kii bench ne is bahes ko suna he
 There were three parties when the Supreme Court arrived, but later the number of parties increased
 8000 pannon kaa faisla he, elahabaad hoicourt kaa
 The matter reaches its conclusion on September 30, 2010 after sixty years in Allahabad High Court
 2010 ke faisle ke anusaar vivaadit bhoomi yani 2
 The 7 acres of land will be divided equally between the three sides
 ek hindu paksh ko, ek muslim paksh ko or ek nirmohi akhaada ko gaya
 The place where Ram Lala sits in the temporary temple was given to the Hindu side
 sita rasoi or ram chabutara kaa hissaa nirmohi akhaada ko diya gaya, teesraa sunni vakf ko diya gaya
 At the time of partition, a little exchange of land was also allowed
 elahabaad hoicourt main teen jajon kii bench ne sunwaayee kii thi
 Justice SU Khan, Justice Dharamvir Sharma, Justice Sudhir Aggarwal continued to hear for 90 working days
 11 janvari 2010 se sunwaayee shuru hui thi, 30 sitambar 2010 ko faisla aayaa tha
 This issue is being presented in the media as faith, but it is in the form of a land dispute before the court
 jameen kaa maalik koun he, angrezi main tital suut kehete hai
 The National Broadcasters Association has issued an advisory regarding the coverage of the case
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai taaki aap bhi dekhen ki is adwiseri kaa kitna paalan ho rahaa he
 The Supreme Court should not have an argument about a hearing or decision 
 faisle kaa nateeja kya hoga, ise lekar bhi atakalbaazi nahin honi chahie
 No news should pass through the eyes of the reporter and the editor
 babari masjid dhwans kaa koi purana footage nahin dikhaaya janaa chahie
 No footage of the celebration should be shown in protest or support of the verdict
 kisi samudaay ke prati kisi prakaar kaa purvaagrah pradarshit nahin hona chahie
 Whoever spoke in an extreme manner should not be given a place in the debate
 bhadakaau bahason se bachaa janaa chahie
 The year also came in 2010, which was followed by all, but whether it will be followed, you will see
 yah nirdesh 16 oktober ko aayaa he lekin uske pehle channelon par kis tarah is maamle kii sunwaayee kaa kawarez hua he, aap khud jaanch karen
 What kind of colors were used, how inflammatory graphics were made, languages were spoken, religions names were written, you will know how dhjjis are flown
 kaash ye nirdesh pehle aayaa hota
 It is better that you read the decision of the High Court
 supreme court ke faisle ko bhi puraa puraa padhein
 Keep in mind, there can be no full reporting of its specifics in TV
 viraag gupta ne is cese ke itihaas par sankshipt kitaab likhi he
 There are some interesting things in it
 zyaadaatar dastauez digital hone ke baad bhi teen saal lag gaye supreme court tak aane main
 These documents were in Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi, Persian
 elahabaad hoicourt main hindi main sunwaayee to ho gai lekin supreme court main angrezi main honi thi
 Many documents were translated into English and it took another two years
 8000 pannon ke is faisle main joint tital holder kaha gaya tha
 The two parts were divided into Ram Lala and Nirmohi Akhara
 lekin ve donon bhi adaalat gaye
 Both were demanding different rights
 sunni vakf board bhi apane hisse par daavedaari kar rahaa he
 What are the claims of the three parties
 ab ham jo bataa rahe hai uskaa sambandh bahes se alag uske itihaas se he
 Faizan Mustafa has put four videos on youtube, describing how the journey of this dispute begins
 dekhne ke liye aapako you tub par janaa hoga
 After all, this issue has been in court for 133 years
 is vivaad main sabase puraani party nirmohi akhaada he jo 133 saal se is cese ko lard rahaa he
 Hindu Mahasabha for 68 years and Sunni Waqf Board for 57 years
 elahabaah hoicourt main hi 60 saal baad faisla aayaa tha
 In the judgment of Allahabad High Court, Justice Khan has said that both Hindus and Muslims have been offering prayers and prayers on this land unexpectedly
 justise sudhir agarwal ne bhi kaha ki imaarat ke inner courtyard yani garbh grih hindu or musalmaan donon kaa he
 The Allahabad High Court, before its order, presented the summary of the conclusion of the Zest of Finding in 12 points
 yah sabit nahin hota he ki vivaadit kshetra kaa dhaancha babar kaa he yaa uskaa jisane masjid banavaai yaa jiske aadesh par banavaai gai
 No temple was demolished to build the mosque
 masjid mandir ke bhagnavsheshon ke upar bani, jo kaaphi samay se vahaan khadi thi
 Until the mosque was built, Hindus believed that a large part of the disputed area belonged to the birthplace of Sri Rama
 haalanki wo koun sa kshetra tha, iskaa zikr nahin tha
 Shortly after the mosque was built, Hindus started identifying that part of the disputed area with Ram Janmabhoomi
 san 1885 se bahut pehle ram chabutara or sita rasoi kaa astitv tha or hindu vahaan puja karte the
 It is very unique and unexpected that there is a Hindu religious place within the compound of the mosque, where Namaz is also recited
 is baat ke baad ki donon us vivaadit kshetra main ibaadat kar rahe the lekin sabit nahin hota ki kisi khaas hisse ke maalik the
 Both were partners
 donon paksh apana daawa sabit nahin kar sake isliye donon ko saajheedaar mana gaya
 The statue was placed under the dome on 23 December 1949
 use janmasthan ke rup main mana jane laga
 When the decision came in 2010, there was peace in the country, especially the way Mayawati handled the administration in UP at that time, it was highly praised
 bharosa rakhie ki is baar bhi vaisaa hi hoga

 ' pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ko lekar bihar sarkaar or centre sarkaar aamane saamne hai
 The Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme is not being implemented in Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne yojana par kadi aapatti jataai he
 Their objection is that the premium rate of insurance is different for each state
 is yojana main rajya or kendra ko 50:50 ansh daan raashi dena he, aise main is yojana kaa naam pradhanmantri fasal beemaa hi kyon hona chahie
 Bihar government believes that there should be uniformity in the premier rate of insurance in all states and the Center should bear 90 percent of the expenditure of this scheme
 centre or rajya ke is jhagade main pis rahe hai bihar ke kisaan
 Farmers in Samastipur have threatened to commit suicide if they are not compensated for crop compensation
 alag-alag hai beemaa darpradhanmantri fasal beemaa kii nai yojana ke tahat 15 agast tak rajya sarkaar ko beemaa companiyon kaa chayan kar lenaa he, lekin bihar sarkaar is yojana kii vyavastha ko lekar hi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 Under this scheme, the Central and State Governments have to give 50-50 percent amount
 saath hi sabhi rajyon ke liye premyam raashi alag-alag tay kii gai he
 For example, the farmers of Uttar Pradesh have to pay a premium of 5 percent and the farmers of Bihar 15 percent
 bihar sarkaar ne nahin maani yojanabihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki isse lagata he ki yah yojana kisaanon ke liye nahin, balki beemaa companiyon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye banaai gai he
 The Bihar government wants that there should be uniformity in insurance premiums
 ye nahin hona chahie ki uttar pradesh main agle saal chunaav hai to vahaan ke kisaanon ko kam premium dena pade or bihar ke kisaanon ko zyada
 Under this scheme, Bihar will have to pay six and a half crore rupees
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki itani raashi kisaanon ko kshatipurti ke liye kyon nahin di jaae, bajaae beemaa companiyon ko dene
 All states ready: Agriculture Minister, the Cooperative Minister of Bihar Government has demanded in front of the Union Agriculture Minister that under this scheme, the Center should give 90 percent amount and 10 percent should be earmarked for the state
 saath main ye bhi maang rakhi kii premium main ekarupata honi chahie
 But the Center did not accept any demand from Bihar
 kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh kehete he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se bihar main ye yojana lagu nahi ho paa rahi he
 The Chief Minister is making such an argument, like Bihar is different from the country
 sabhi rajya taiyaar hai to phir bihar ko kyon aapatti he
 This political tussle is directly affecting the farmers
 kahin baadh to kahin sukhe ke saath-saath beej kaa dhokhaa dena kisaanon ke liye ji kaa janjaal bana hua he
 They do not see a ray of hope from anywhere, in such a situation, if the farmers do not threaten suicide, what else will they do

 The biggest target in the master plan that the BJP has prepared in UP is to make a big dent in Mayawati's Dalit vote bank

 Therefore, BJP has been trying to strengthen its Dalit vote bank through Ambedkar first

 Anand Kumar, the founder of Super-30, is a name that is known not only in India but the whole world
 jald hi un par ek film aane vaali he, jiskaa naam 'super 30' he
 In this film, his character will be played by Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan
 aaj bhale hi anand kumaar ko lakhon-karodon log jaanate hai, lekin unki is safalataa ke peeche kadaa sangharsh chipa he
 Anand Kumar's father, who hails from Patna, Bihar, worked as a clerk in the Postal Department
 ghar kii aarthik sthiti acchhee na hone kii vajah se unki padhai hindi medium sarkari skool main hui
 During school, he was very fond of mathematics
 jahaan unhone khud se ganit ke nae formule ijad kiye
 After this he was called from Cambridge University
 is mahila kii badaulat taiyaar hui sainitory pad dyspose karne kii mashin, ye he khaasiyatanhin the cambridge uniwarsity main jane ke paisejaise-taise unhone garibi main padhai to puri kar lee, lekin jab unhen cambridge uniwarsity se bulaava aayaa, to vah ja nahin paye
 The reason was the economic condition of the house
 unhen cambridge jane or rahane ke liye lagbhag 50 hajaar rupye kii jarurat thi, itane paise anand ke paas nahin the
 At the same time, his dream could not be realized due to the death of father and tight financial condition
 jiske baad ghar kii sari jimmedaari anand ke kandhon par aa gai thi
 To improve the economic condition of the house, Anand started teaching his favorite subject in mathematics to children
 haalanki vah khud garibi main padhe-likhe the
 Because of which he did not charge much fees for studies from children
 isliye unhone thode or paise kamaane ke liye apni maa ke saath ghar main papad banane kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Anand used to sell his mother-made papadas on a cycle for four hours in the evening
 pakora bechney vaala bana karodon kaa maalik, kuch aisi he safalataa kii kahanikaise anand kumaar bane charchaa kaa vishaysuper-30 ke sansthaapak anand kumaar jin 30 bacchon ko joint entrens ejamination kii koching de rahe the, unamem 30 main se 30 chaatro ko kamayabi mili thi
 After which he became the subject of discussion
 ye sabhi jaanate hai ki IIT main admician paanaa kaaphi kathin he, lekin anand ne garib bacchon ko iaiti jaise pratishthit santhaan main admician ke sapane ko hakeekat main badal diya tha
 Launched with two children, 'ramanujan School of Mathematics' Anand Kumar, who is called the messiah of poor children, opened his Institute 'ramanujan School of Mathematics' with 2 children
 is skool main admician ke naam par koi student 100 rupye to koi 200 detaa tha
 Let me tell you, from their institute, they select 30 students every year and get ready for the examination like Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced
 lekin in super 30 chaatro ko silect karne se pehle pariksha lee jaati he, jisamen paas hone ke baad hi unhen super-30 main jagah di jaati he
 After selecting the children, Anand keeps them with him and takes care of everything from his studies to writing and drinking
 kheti ke liye chhod di ejineering, aise shuru kiya khud kaa bijnesanand kumaar ne saal 1992 main ramanujan skool of mathematics kii shuruyaat kii thi
 At the same time, most of the students in his institute come from a family who do not have that much money to study engineering
 bataa den, saal 2009 main, discovery channel ne super 30 par ek program dikhaaya tha
 The New York Times has also written about Anand Kumar and his Super 30
 anand kumaar kaa puraa parivaar super 30 main shaamil he
 His mother oversees food for all the children studying in Super 30 and his brother handles Super 30 management

 bollywood ke superstar salmaan khan kii aane vaali film 'bajrangi bhaijan' isi id par relies hone ja rahi he
 Salman's fans are eagerly waiting for this film
 lekin shaayad hi aapako pataa ho ki film kii bacchee harshali ko kisi bhi public place par jane kii ijaajat tab tak nahin he jab tak ki film relies naa ho jaae
 For this, the contract of the film producers with the parents of the child has been done
 isi tarah kii film 'bajrangi bhaijan' se judi or bhi kai rochak baaten salmaan khan ne hamaari team se share kin
 Let's know aapkaa kirdaar 'pawan kumaar chaturvedi' kaisaa he?ek gaanv kaa bholaa bhaalaa, sharif, mehnatee baccha he jo ki pita ko impress karnaa chahta he, dasvin main das baar fail he, kyonki cheeting karke paas hone kii aadat nahin he
 So this character does not want to pass by copying
 sach ke liye hameshaa se taiyaar he
 He is a child of a Hindu family, never seen Muslims
 film main aap or karina bhi hai, vah mulaaqaat kaise hoti he?meri or karina kii mulaaqaat film main 5 rupee kii vajah se hoti he
 Pawan calls Kareena as 'behenji'
 karina pawan kii sachai se prabhavit hokar use pasand karne lagati hai
 How does this Pakistani girl come to India? Actually Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi, a devotee of Bajrangbali, is singing during a function in Kurukshetra and there he finds a hungry thirsty girl and then the story moves forward
 bas pawan kumaar tipical hindu parivaar se he, use baahar kii duniya kaa kuch bhi pataa nahin hota
 a lot of questions are being raised in the name of the film as well? The character is 'pawan Kumar Chaturvedi', a great devotee of Hanuman ji, that's why people lovingly call it 'bajrangi'
 jab yah pakistan chalaa jaataa he to vahaan par use 'bhaijan' bulaayaa jaataa he to is tareeke se vah 'bajrangi bhaijan' ho jaataa he
 According to you, which is the most important scene of the film? a small scene but very important when you reach Munni with Munni and start telling all the truth about how the girl had reached India and brought her back to Pakistan
 If, then the character says, 'you have come from India to Pakistan to introduce this girl to Ammi Abbu, if there were others like you, it would have been something else, Bhaijaan
 bahut hi sundar seen he
 Small but quite important
 aapkaa or navaj kaa kya saamanjasy he?navazuddin film main ek jarnlist hai unhe har patrkaar kii tarah khabaren chahie hoti hai
 When they discover that what they are looking for is not really them, then their interest in the story ends
 unhen lagata he ki main ek aatankwaadi yaa ghuspaithi hum
 Can be expected that the film will be released in Pakistan too? i don't think there is anything in this film that is against India or Pakistan
 agar aapako hindustan pakistan kii ladaai dekhni he to aapako is film ko dekhne kii jarurat nahin he

 There is an old saying that women build physical relationships to get love, while men love to have relationships
 lekin yahaan gaur farmaane vaali baat yah he ki apane partner ke saath pyaar ke un khaas palon main aapke man main kya chal rahaa hota he
 That is, what are you thinking at that time
 adhyayan ke liye puche gaye is sawaal ke kai dilachasp jawaab saamne aae hai
 Many accepted that he thinks that he is better than his partner's x and whether he will be able to satisfy his partner
 haal hi is ore ek adhyayan main pyaar ke un palon main purush or mahila donon kii soch ko lekar sawaal kiye gaye
 Some of the answers that come are like this - Many men have accepted that whenever their partner takes off their clothes, they wonder if their partner is hot? People said that they get excited at such a time, but at the same time they start testing the partner's hotness in any corner of the mind
 aksar un khaas palon main purush kaa dimag sambandh banane par kendrit rahata he
 While many questions are going on in the mind of a woman
 masalan, kya uskaa partner hameshaa uske saath rahegaa yaa nahin? kya vah apane saathi ko khush kar paaegi?aam taur par mahilaon ke man main yah sawaal bhi kaundhta he ki jane uskaa partner kitni mahilaon ke saath sambandh bana chukaa he
 However, they like men who have experience of making physical relationships, because such partners help in enhancing their sexuality
 study ke mutabik, mahilaayein sambandh banane ke dauraan partner dwaara kii gai tarif ko pasand karti hai
 It boosts their confidence and also increases their excitement
 agar aap shaadishuda jivan kaa puraa anand uthaanaa chaahati hai to saas ko khush rakhana behad jaruri he
 But many women, especially those who have been newly married, do not manage this relationship and fill the married life with bitterness
 saas ko khush rakhana itnaa mushkil bhi nahin he
 If you want, you can make this relationship happy with a little effort: 1
 aap ek parivaar se alag hokar ek duusare parivaar kaa hissaa banane ja rahi hai
 This family was complete in itself before you arrived
 ag aap bhi uskaa hissaa he
 They will have their own habits and their own traditions
 apni jarurat or marji ke hisaab se sabakuch badalane kii baat sochakar nae ghar main na aaen
 Tell them your point and also try to know their point of view
 aisa karke ek saajha rasta nikaalkar aage badhen
 2
 apane saath pehle se hi koi tay soch lekar nae ghar main pravesh na karen
 Try to openly accept the new ideas of your in-laws
 aapako unke liye khud ko puri tarah se badalane kii jarurat nahin he lekin unamem bhi sabakuch badalane kii baat na sochen
 3
 aap ye jaanane kii koshish karen ki aisa kya he jo aapako bhi pasand he or unhen bhi

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has attacked bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi on the pretext of Gujarat
 unhone bina naam liye modi ke vikaas ke daavon kii hawa yah kahkar nikaalane kii koshish kii, ki gujarat to mahabharat kaal se hi viksit he
 Bihar Chief Minister alleged that BJP is not loyal to Bihar
 unhone kaha, 'bihar main agar kuch bhi negative hota he to bijepi ko bady khushi hoti he
 They discuss the state that is already developed
 jo viksit he use or viksit karnaa koun si badi baat he
 The big thing is to develop a backward state like Bihar
 'nitish ne kaha ki gujarat mahabharat kaal se hi viksit he
 Leaving Mathura, Lord Krishna made the capital at Dwarka, which was Port City and is still today
 bhagwaan krishna ke paas sabase badi sena thi, unki nitiyaan puure desh main chalati thi
 Bihar is the land of knowledge
 yahaan chanakya or aryabhatta jaise log rahe hai
 There are ancient universities like Nalanda and Vikramashila
 shashan chalaane kii dakshata bihar ke paas hi he
 Speaking about the backwardness of Bihar at Narendra Modi's rallies in Bihar, Nitish Kumar said that there is also a plan for APL to construct toilets in Bihar
 unhone kaha bihar aisa pehla rajya he jahaan sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav ladane waalon ke liye ghar main apana shauchalay hona anivaary he
 Bihar also leads in the female literacy campaign
 kanoon vyavastha kii baat karte hue nitish ne kaha ki bihar aparaadhiyon ko sajaa dilaane main sabase aage he lekin isaki charchaa koi nahi karata
 He said that when electricity was discussed at the rally in Muzaffarpur, people started getting up because in Bihar where there is an electric pole and wire there is electricity for 16 to 20 hours
 abhi 2300 megawatt kii khapat he is saal ke ant tak yah 3000 megawatt ho jayega or agle saal 4000 megawatt khapat ho jane kaa lakshya he
 He said that Bihar is the first state in the country where human development indicators have been fixed
 lekin jahaan kuposhan he shiksha or swasthya suvidhaon kaa abhaav he vahaan viksit hone kaa hallaa kiya jaataa he
 Nitish Kumar said that development means taking everyone along
 aisa nahi he ki ek jamaat ke aa jane se desh main koi sarkaar chalaa saktaa he
 India is a large country and many religious religions and caste people live in it
 desh par vahi raaj kar saktaa he jo sabko lekar chal sake

 Let us know that many players from India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, England and South Africa are participating in the tournament
 bharat mahaan raashtra he
 More than fifteen years ago i recognized its inner strength, and at a time when very few people thought of it, i designed a document that would later become a pioneering and inspirational document - Vision-2020 for Andhra Pradesh
 sabhi rajyon or centreshasit pradeshon main isi tarah kaa kaam kiye jane kii jarurat he
 i firmly believe that the human resources of the country are rich and good, and if trained and used properly they can show results beyond imagination
 maine tabhi yah dekh liya tha or main daleel detaa aa rahaa hum ki bharat 21veen sadi kii pehali timahi tak duniya ke teen yaa chaar sarvocch rashtron main shaamil ho saktaa he
 This is happening in India today
 agar aap dekhen ki bhartiya duniya bhar main kya kar rahe hai to yah jaanakar santushti hogi ki ve asaadhaaran rup se acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 There are three main reasons for this: Indians are very hardworking by their nature; They are mainly from the middle and lower middle classes, who believe that the fruit of patience is sweet; And thirdly, they are also demonstrating entrepreneurship by taking many risky risks
 europe, america, china or japan ke samaajon ko dekhne par hamen jabardast shakti kaa ehsaas hota he-hamaare paas yuvaaon kii badi sankhya he, jo unke paas nahin he yaa us par sachmuch fakhr mahasoos kar sakate hai
 It is a fact that 50 percent of our population is under 25 years of age
 yah hamaari sabase badi thati he jabaki kai viksit or vikasshil deshon ke liye unki budhaati aabaadi sabase badi baadhak he
 India is gradually using this power for sure
 isi vajah se bharat 1991 main apni arthvyavastha ko mukt karne or udaarikaran kii visheshtaon ko apnaane ke baad sudhaar kar rahaa he
 Our progress as a society is comforting and very few people thought that the situation would improve in this way
 lekin duusare loktantric or khule samaajon ke saath isaki tulana karne par dil baith jaataa he
 This is because the rich are becoming more wealthy
 duniya ke 10 sabase amir logon main se chaar bharat ke hi hai
 Worse, Indians constitute 40% of the richest people
 yah hamaare jaise bahustareey samaaj ke liye acha sanket nahin he
 Creation of wealth is important but meaningful distribution of wealth is equally important
 apni saamaajik chintaaen dur karne or sampann tathaa vanchit logon ke bich kii khai paatane ke maamle main yahi asli chunauti he
 But we need to improve our political, administrative and even judicial system to meet the social challenges like providing drinking water, eliminating malnutrition and providing better healthcare to our people
 hamaare samvidhan main kisi tarah kii jyaadati ko rokane kii vyavastha he lekin loktantric vyavastha or sansthaaon ko apni jimmedaariyaan tathaa kartavya nibhaane main kotahi or laaparvaahee se rokane ke liye bahut kam yaa vastutah nahin ke baraabar vyavastha he
 Our democracy has both advantages and disadvantages
 hamen aise sakasham logon ko talashne kii jarurat he jo sarthak sudhaaron kii yojana banaakar unhen lagu kar saken taaki sabhi loktantric sansthaaon ko sakriy kiya ja sake or samaaj ke pramukh ko javabdeh banaaya ja sake
 Efforts to break the system for personal self-interest should be stopped
 isaki bajaae in sansthaaon ko majboot karne ke tareeke nikaalane chahie or agar jarurat ho to iske liye doorgaami sudhaaron ke suzav dekar unhen majbootee se lagu karnaa chahie
 i have tried for this in Andhra Pradesh, building some world class infrastructure and facilities
 inamen ek nayaa antarrashtriya hawaii adda, jo duniya ke 10 behtareen hawaii addon main shaamil he, indian skool of bijness, jise behtareen sansthaaon main gina jaataa he, or ek international kanvension centre, jiskaa puure asia main koi sani nahin he, shaamil hai
 It is because of this experience that i think India will definitely be one of the major nations of the world in less than 20 years
 sirf mere liye hi nahin balki raajnneeti main rahete hue kisi ko bhi nitiniyantaa bananaa he to uske saamne dhan kaa nirmaan karte hue garib logon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhkar samvedansheel virgon kii raksha karnaa sabase badi chunauti he
 This is what i have always done and painted
 cash transfar skim, jiskaa maine chunaav main vaada kiya he, isi tarah kii ek pahal he
 My effort is to implement the pro-poor programs tried in other societies
 main apni saamaajik chintaa kii vajah se santulit vikaas or samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko saath lekar chalane kaa prayaas karata hum
 i believe that we can build a strong and healthy India in this way
 ham sahi disha main ja rahe hai or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki adhikadhik raajnneetik, khaskar nae or yuva raajnneetik, jaruri patibaddhta or ichhashakti kaa pradarshan karenge
 If all of them have done so with commitment, then as a developing nation, we can well fulfill our promises made to the people

 5 questions from Chandrababu Naidu, what will you do to get India out of the economic crisis? It is a short-lived crisis
 hamen sampatti nirmaan, adhik rajasav paidaa karne, rojgaar ke avasaron kaa srijan karne or sankat kii is ghadi main garibon ko sangrakshan dene kii jarurat he
 What measures will you take to restore people's confidence in national security? In the war against terror, a strict policy should be adopted instead of ad hoc response and attitude
 police sudhaar lagu karne samet prashasnic sudhaar samay kii maang he
 Confidence can be restored by setting up more institutions like the recently formed National Investigation Agency to do special work
 aparaadh nyaay vyavastha kii haalat kharaab he
 What will you do? Many commissions have recommended reform of the criminal justice system and jails
 hamen unhen fouran lagu karne kii jarurat he
 The administration is a victim of corruption and lack of accountability
 aap kya karenge?aisi vyavastha viksit karuunga jisase faisla karne ke maamle main paardarshita ko badhaava mili
 This includes the use of technology
 lakshith labhaarthiyon ko kalyaan yojanaon kaa laabh pahunchane ke liye smart card kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The criminalization of politics has now become an epidemic
 aap ise kaise khatm karenge?rajnatik partiyon ko milane vaale paise kaa hisaab-kitaab hona chahie or kaale dhan ko rokane kii vyavastha honi chahie
 This will stop criminalization
 iske liye hamen chunaav prakriya main bhi sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
