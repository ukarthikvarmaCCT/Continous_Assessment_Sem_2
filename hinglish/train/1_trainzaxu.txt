 sawaal apni jameen par bheeh raveesh kumarmuktibodh, raghuveer sahay yaa sarveshwar dayaal saxena ke daur main patrakarita or lekhan ko lekar aksar yah baheschalati rahi ki bhashaa or bimb hone kaise chahie
 The language should be of the common people or understand the power
 bimb satta ke antarvirodh ko ukerne vaale hon yaa aam aadmi ke langot ko baandhe door kii tarah
 In the 70-80 era, there was also a debate in the language of journalism to find a piece of literature, and without literature, there was a debate about 'how incomplete or how complete' journalism was
 yani vah daur sarokaar kaa tha
 Where the mixture of relationships and cultural and social environment was mixed like a juice in dialogue
 vah ras dinmaan or ravivaar kii patrakarita ke dauraan barkaraar rahaa
 Phaniwar Nath Renu's reporting of Patna floods is an amazing mixture of literature and journalism
 jise pathakon ne itnaa pansad kiya ki rinjal-dhanjal ke naam se yah ripotirg kitaab ke rup main bhi saamne ai
 But the question is why in these days, there is a need to scrape these pages of journalism, soaked with dust? This question can stand in the mind of any reader
 to raveesh kumaar kii pustak dekhte rahiye kii bhashaa or bimb ne bhaagti-daudti patrakarita ke daur main jis tarah tehraaya, usee tarah is baat ke liye bhi vivash kiya ki patrakarita se samvaad banaate hue patrakarita ke sarokaaron kii gudagudi mahasoos kii jaae
 Ravish is a TV journalist and there is no need to blacken the paper for how the news channel's journalism is gasping
 raveesh bhi is rau main behate-tairte najar jarur aate hai
 But the style of swimming against the stream that he has developed emerges in writing more than TV
 yun bhi news channel kaa screen kisi ek kii soch kaa nateeja ho nahin paata lekin lekhan nijee hota he
 And after that, when a journalist is trying to make an instant dent while battling the entire freight train of journalism, then how the images and dialogues emerge, keep in mind
 raveesh ke bheetar kii bechaini bhi najar aati he, jo vikaas ke aasamaani pahie par kulanchen maarthe, lakdi gaadi ke asthi-panjaron main bharat ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 In Bill Gates's creative capitalism, how can even five-ten rupees be kept in daily wages and how Shani Chalisa is sitting in the gross world
 raveesh kisi bhi vastu ko pakadte poonch se hai lekin dhire-dhire jis tarah vah sound ko pakadaney kii disha main badhate hai, usko dekhte rahiye main bakhubi mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 Anything around us, be it pizza or sattu
 raveesh kii kalam fast food kuredate-kuredate bazaar kii samoochee marketing ko chand shabdon main samajha detii he
 Keep watching and climb the social stairs and through TV, the brand also shows the mirror to the society
 yani soochna kranti ke jis daur main har hatheli par samvaad kisi choti lakeer sareekha ho chukaa he, vahaan dekhte rahiye lakeer dekhne ke tareeke ko ek nai paribhaasha main gadhate hue is ehsaas ko jilanaa chaahati he ki soochna kaa matlab sach nahin he
 Information is also not concerned
 soochna sirf dhandha he or dhandhe ke chakravyuuh main funskar bhi use samajhne kaa hunar agar aapmen nahin he to phir aap dhara main bahati mari machhlee se zyada ho nahin sakate
 Keep watching, this feeling can touch any TV journalist again and again
 raveesh apni jameen ko pahachaanate hai or usee bimb ke aasare kalam ko camere ke lens kii tarah baar-baar parakhte najar aate hai
 Language is not about power
 bimb aam aadmi ke hai, jo congress ke haath se alag hai or bhaajapa ke camel tale ke keechad se bhi alag
 Style is of the pain of the village left behind while living in the city
 or yah lekhan soshal media kii dein he, jo blog kasbaa main likhe kollam ko tarashkar is kitaab kii shakl main saamne ai he
 Keep watching because Ravish has also raised questions on his land in the same book: be it English or Hindi or Gujarati / Ghanta khak khoon hain / Jhade chalte hai Bokrati / Stop TV now / TV is fuckin Khatal / Milk does not sell / It is like a mountain of dung
 dekhte rahiye ko dekhie jaraa ek najar

 Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has made a big statement about the future of Indian cricket's legendary wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ganguli ke mutabik south africa ke khilaaf teen maichon kii gharelu tii-20 siries ke liye dhoni ko nahin chune jane se vah hairaan nahin hai
 Ganguly said that at the international level, Dhoni's future is now in the hands of current Indian captain Virat Kohli and team management
 ganguli ne kaha ki jab dhoni ko south africa ke khilaaf hone vaali tii-20 siries ke liye nahin chunaa gaya to isse ve hairaan nahin the
 Ganguly said, 'I did not expect that Dhoni would be selected
 ’ ganguli ne kaha ki westeindies daure par pant kaa chunanaa bataata he ki team management ab bhavishya dekh rahaa he
 The team management wants to accompany Pant
 is baat kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki unhen windies daure ke liye chunaa he
 This is similar to when Dhoni was young and was given a chance
 ’ganguli ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki dhoni ke bhavishya ko lekar viraat kaaphi ahm hai
 It is difficult to say what he is talking to Dhoni and i do not think anyone should jump into it and give his statement
 maine hameshaa se kaha he ki chaahe diego maradona, peet sampraas, sachin tendulkar, main yaa dhoni, koi bhi ho har koi us daur main aata he jab use is tarah kii sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 "so what is the game of Dhoni, the world's best finisher, finished? When comparing Rishabh Pant to Dhoni, Ganguly said," Pant is not MS Dhoni nor will he be in the next three-four years
 dhoni ko ‘da em es dhoni’ banane main 15 saal lage
 He is a part of the special group of Indian cricket
 ’ ganguli ne kaha ki rishabh pant behtareen khilaadi hai or bharat ko unke saath dhairya rakhana hoga
 Let us know that Virat Kohli is close to becoming India's most successful test captain
 agar bharat westeindies ke khilaaf jamaica test jeet jaataa he to kohli ke naam 28 test jeet ho jaaengi or ve emes dhoni se aage nikal jaaenge
 Ganguly said, 'kohli is a great captain and he is getting better day by day
 ipel main unki kaaphi aalochana hui thi, lekin iske baad bhi maine kaha tha ki mujhe unki captaini par bharosa he
 He captained well in the World Cup

 This country was - Tunisia
 or is nanhe se desh ne apane yahaan loktantr ke liye jo kranti kii thi, use kaha gaya tha 'arab spring' - jahaan 'spring' kaa arth vasant nahin, kranti he
 More importantly, this Arab revolution was not limited to this country
 isaki lapten africa ke misr, morocco evam libya se lekar madhya-asia ke yaman, bahrain tathaa pashchim asia ke syria evam jordan tak bhi pahunchi, or acchhee-khaasi pahunchi

 As far as India is concerned, Tunisia, which is about 7,000 kilometers away from us, may not be very important, but what it has done till the beginning of a democratic revolution is very important
 yadi tunisia arab ke anya rashtron ke liye dilchaspee evam prerana kaa strot ban sakaa, to in deshon kii loktantric sarkaron se bharat ko apane sambandhon ko ghanishtha karne main adhik madad mil sakegi
 This will enable India to establish a balance of power against Pakistan in that region

 In this way, eight liters of diesel is consumed in a day
 agar skool maheene ke 25 din chalata he jo aam taur par nahin hota, to (25X8) = 200 litre deazal ek bas main lagata he
 According to 60 rupees a liter, a bus will cost diesel of Rs 12,000 per month

 Six tires of the bus come for sixty thousand, so put five thousand rupees every month on this item

 In this way, a train cost 43000 rupees every month
 43000 = ( 12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)

 Buttons have school names written on them, which have to be purchased from the school itself

 a parent from Guwahati has written that last year when we started the movement, the fees in the school did not increase this year, but this year the school has taken Rs 1500 for a book of history
 agar unka daawa sahi he to hamen shame aani chahie
 Our viewer Vikramjit has told that there is only one school uniform in China
 vahaan bachche trek suut pahante hai
 Swati has written that she has recently come to India from India
 yahaan koi skool uniform nahin hota he
 In India, we were suffering exploitation of schools
 bharat main bhi kuch skulon main nursery ke bachche ko skool uniform nahin lagata he
 There is only one such school in Delhi, there is no uniform for two years of nursery
 skool kahata he ki baccha purana kapadaa hi pahanakar aae vahi uchit hoga
 But i will not talk about two to four good schools
 main bharat ke tamaam shaharon main skulon ke bheetar ho rahi lut kii baat kar rahaa hum
 First of all i want to talk about a mail from Rajkot regarding teacher's salary
 agar is email kii soochna sahi he to rajkot kaa ek skool adhik selary teacher ke acount main jamaa karata he
 All teacher's atms are with the school management
 unka password bhi
 Management withdraws money after salary is deposited
 aisa hi ek mail upi se aayaa tha ki check pehle le lete hai, teacher ke acount main paisa jamaa hota he or nikaal liya jaataa he
 This is the teacher's condition
 skool main padhaane vaale mata-pita bhi dare hue hai
 Teacher is also scared
 skulon ke zariye logon par gulaami thopi ja rahi he
 Now come to the transport
 bason main suraksha niyamon ke paalan main baari laaparvaahee kii shikaayat ai hai
 In buses with capacity of 50, 100-100 children are sent to the room
 bason main first aid kit nahin rakhi hoti he
 Buses also have poor maintenance
 bas chaalak sadak niyamon kaa paalan nahin karte
 The Supreme Court has also given broad instructions regarding the safety of school buses
 kai skool paalan bhi karte hai or zyaadaatar nahin bhi karte hai
 For example, if a bus or van is hired for a school, it should be written on school duty
 bas ke dryver kii uniform bhi tay kar di gai he
 According to the Supreme Court, the driver should have a list of all the children boarding the bus
 jisamen bacchon ke naam, class, ghar kaa pataa, blad gup, stoppage, root plane hona chahie
 The windows of the bus should have horizontal grills
 bas main aag bujhane vaala upkaran hona anivaary he
 It is mandatory to write the school name and telephone number on the bus
 skool bas main kam se kam ek atendent hona chahie
 School buses should have speed governors
 skool kii gaadi kaa rang haive yelo hona chahie or bich main 150 mem kii hari pattee chaaron ore bichon bich honi chahie
 If school children are less than 12 years, then more than one and a half times the capacity of the bus should not be taken
 tippaniyan Nowadays many schools have started buying yellow bus but many children still go by van
 bas kaa kiraaya tay karne kaa koi sarvamaanya formula nahin he
 In any school, even if the house is 100 meters away, it is mandatory to go by bus
 aisa kuch mata pita ne i-mail kar bataaya he
 We have understood the accounting of buses from a transport officer
 42 seater bas kaa udhaaharan lete hue unhone bataaya ki ek saamaanya skool bas ek litre deazal main 5 kilometre chalati he
 For example, one such bus commutes forty kilometers every day
 is tarah ek din main aath litre deazal kii khapat hoti he
 If the school runs for 25 days of the month, which usually does not happen, then (25X8) = 200 liters of diesel is used on a bus
 60 rupee litre ke hisaab se ek bas main 12,000 rupee kaa har maheene deazal lagegaa
 Put a maintenance cost of Rs 5000 on it every month
 bas ke chah tair saath hazaar ke aate hai, to is mad main paanch hazaar rupye har maheene laga dijie
 Driver's salary - 15000, Helper salary - 6000
 is tarah ek gaadi par har maheene 43000 rupye laagat ai
 43000 = (12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 har din chalis kimi kii duuri tay karne vaali ek bas par har maheene ausatan 43,000 kaa karch aata he
 This does not include the bus installment
 maan lijie 30,000 rupee kist hoti he bas kii
 So according to this, the total cost of the bus will be 73 thousand rupees every month
 agar bas main 42 bachche hi safar karte hai to ek maheene main bas ke liye 1738 rupee kaa kharch aayega
 But we have seen that even for distances of 500 meters to two km, school buses charge two to three thousand or more in the name of fees
 guwahati se ek mata-pita ne likhaa he ki pichley saal ham logon ne andolan kiya to is saal skool main fees nahin badi magar is saal skool ne itihaas kii ek kitaab ke liye 1500 rupee liye hai
 We should be ashamed if his claim is true
 hamaare darshak vikramjit ne bataaya he ki puure china main ek hi skool uniform he
 Children there wear track suits
 swati ne likhaa he ki ve haal hi main bharat se america ain hai
 There is no school uniform here
 bharat main hamen skulon kaa shoshan bhugatna pad rahaa tha
 Even in India, in some schools, the nursery child does not find school uniform
 dilli main hi ek aisa skool he, nursery ke do saal tak koi uniform nahin he
 The school says that the child should be wearing the same old clothes as it is appropriate
 lekin main do chaar achche skulon kii baat nahin karuunga
 i am talking about the loot happening within schools in all cities of India
 pehle teacher kii selary ko lekar rajkot se aae ek mail kii baat karnaa chahta hum
 If the information in this email is correct, then a school in Rajkot deposits more salary in the account of the teacher
 sabhi teacher kaa atm skool prabandhan ke paas he
 Their password too
 selary jamaa hone ke baad prabandhan paisa nikaal letaa he
 One such mail came from UP that checks are taken first, money is deposited in the teacher's account and withdrawn
 ye teacher kii haalat he
 Parents who teach in school are also scared
 teacher bhi dare hue hai
 Slavery is being imposed on people through schools
 ab aa jate hai transport par
 There have been complaints of heavy negligence in the buses in following the safety rules
 50 kii kshamta vaali bason main 100-100 bachche thuns kar bheje jate hai
 Buses do not have a First Aid Kit
 bason kaa rakrakhaav bhi karaab hota he
 Bus drivers do not follow the road rules
 skool bason kii suraksha ko lekar supreme court ne vyapak nirdesh bhi diye hai
 Many schools also follow and most do not
 jaise kisi skool ke liye bas yaa vine kiraaye par lee jaaegi to us par on skool duty likhaa hona chahie
 The uniform of the driver of the bus has also been fixed
 supreme court ke anusaar driver ke paas bas main savaar sabhi bacchon kii ek suchi honi chahie
 Which should contain children's names, class, home address, blood group, stoppage, root plan
 bas kii khidakiyon par horizontal grills honi chahie
 It is mandatory to have a fire extinguisher in the bus
 bas par skool kaa naam or telephone number likhaa hona anivaary he
 The school bus must have at least one attendant
 skool bason main speed governor lage hone chahie
 The color of the school car should be highway yellow and the 150 mm green strip in the middle should be in the middle
 agar schuli bacchon kii umr 12 saal se kam he to bas kii kshamta ke dedh guna se zyaada bachche nahin le jaae jane chahie
 The comments aaj kal kai skool pili vaali bas to kharidne lage hai magar bahut se bachche abhi bhi vine se hi jate hai
 There is no universally accepted formula for deciding the fare of a bus
 kisi kisi skool main to ghar 100 meter dur he phir bhi bas se janaa anivaary he
 Some such parents have told by email
 hamane ek parivahan adhikari se bason kaa hisaab kitaab samajha he
 Taking the example of a 42 seater bus, he said that a normal school bus runs 5 kilometers in a liter of diesel
 udhaaharan ke liye aisi ek bas har rose chalis kilometre kaa aana-janaa karti he
 In this way, eight liters of diesel is consumed in a day
 agar skool maheene ke 25 din chalata he jo aam taur par nahin hota, to (25X8) = 200 litre deazal ek bas main lagata he
 According to 60 rupees a liter, a bus will cost diesel of Rs 12,000 per month
 is par har maheene 5000 rupee kii mentinence cost laga dijie
 Six tires of the bus come for sixty thousand, so put five thousand rupees every month in this item
 driver kii selary - 15000, helper kii selary - 6000
 In this way, a train cost 43000 rupees every month
 43000 = ( 12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 a bus traveling a distance of forty km every day costs an average of 43,000 per month
 isamen bas kii kist shaamil nahin he
 Suppose Rs 30,000 is the installment of the bus
 to is hisaab se har maheene bas kii kul laagat padegi 73 hazaar rupye
 If only 42 children travel in a bus, then a bus will cost Rs 1738 in a month
 lekin hamane dekha he ki 500 meter se lekar do kimi kii duuri ke liye bhi skool bas fees ke naam par do se teen hazaar yaa usase bhi adhik lete hai
 Now come to the transport
 bason main suraksha niyamon ke paalan main baari laaparvaahee kii shikaayat ai hai
 In buses with capacity of 50, 100-100 children are sent to the room
 bason main first aid kit nahin rakhi hoti he
 Buses also have poor maintenance
 bas chaalak sadak niyamon kaa paalan nahin karte
 The Supreme Court has also given broad instructions regarding the safety of school buses
 kai skool paalan bhi karte hai or zyaadaatar nahin bhi karte hai
 For example, if a bus or van is hired for a school, it should be written on school duty
 bas ke dryver kii uniform bhi tay kar di gai he
 According to the Supreme Court, the driver should have a list of all the children boarding the bus
 jisamen bacchon ke naam, class, ghar kaa pataa, blad gup, stoppage, root plane hona chahie
 The windows of the bus should have horizontal grills
 bas main aag bujhane vaala upkaran hona anivaary he
 It is mandatory to write the school name and telephone number on the bus
 skool bas main kam se kam ek atendent hona chahie
 School buses should have speed governors
 skool kii gaadi kaa rang haive yelo hona chahie or bich main 150 mem kii hari pattee chaaron ore bichon bich honi chahie
 If school children are less than 12 years, then more than one and a half times the capacity of the bus should not be taken
 tippaniyan Nowadays many schools have started buying yellow bus but many children still go by van
 bas kaa kiraaya tay karne kaa koi sarvamaanya formula nahin he
 In any school, even if the house is 100 meters away, it is mandatory to go by bus
 aisa kuch mata pita ne i-mail kar bataaya he
 We have understood the accounting of buses from a transport officer
 42 seater bas kaa udhaaharan lete hue unhone bataaya ki ek saamaanya skool bas ek litre deazal main 5 kilometre chalati he
 For example, one such bus commutes forty kilometers every day
 is tarah ek din main aath litre deazal kii khapat hoti he
 If the school runs for 25 days of the month, which usually does not happen, then (25X8) = 200 liters of diesel is used on a bus
 60 rupee litre ke hisaab se ek bas main 12,000 rupee kaa har maheene deazal lagegaa
 Put a maintenance cost of Rs 5000 on it every month
 bas ke chah tair saath hazaar ke aate hai, to is mad main paanch hazaar rupye har maheene laga dijie

 43000 = (12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 har din chalis kimi kii duuri tay karne vaali ek bas par har maheene ausatan 43,000 kaa karch aata he
 This does not include the bus installment
 maan lijie 30,000 rupee kist hoti he bas kii
 So according to this, the total cost of the bus will be 73 thousand rupees every month
 agar bas main 42 bachche hi safar karte hai to ek maheene main bas ke liye 1738 rupee kaa kharch aayega
 But we have seen that even for distances of 500 meters to two km, school buses charge two to three thousand or more in the name of fees

 Nitish's idea of bringing non-nda parties on one stage was and he cheated us, just like you invite someone to dinner, but when your guests come, you leave the house
 netaaon ne yah bhi kaha ki vah congress party hi thi jisane nitish ko mahagathbandhan ke netaa ke rup main bahut pehle sweekaar kiya tha or lalu or unki party ko apane rukh kaa samarthan karne ke liye majaboor kiya tha

 ashutosh ne somvaar ko twit kiya, kya mujhe faansee par lataka diya janaa chahie or kya bharat phacist desh ho chukaa he? Ashutosh's blog was about the removal of AAP leader and Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar from the party
 ek vivaadit sex sidi saamne aane ke baad sandip kumaar ko arvind kejariwal ne party se nikaal diya he
 Ashutosh's column was published on Thursday
 haalanki tab tak mahila ne sandip kumaar ke khilaaf shikaayat darj nahin karai thi
 Later, the woman filed a rape case against Sandeep Kumar and he was also arrested in the case on Saturday
 purv patrkaar ashutosh ne apane blog main kaha tha, 'yah yon sambandh do vayask logon ke bich aapasi sahmati se sthapit kiye gaye the, or media ne ise anaavashyak rup se tool diya
 He said, 'AAP' has expelled Sandeep Kumar to 'save the image' of the party
 '' He also mentioned in his column how the sexual habits of Indian politicians have not been a matter of public concern or scrutiny in history
 rashtriya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh lalita kumarmangalam ne NDTV se kaha ki unhen ummid he ki ashutosh aadesh ke anusaar guuruuvaar ko unase milenge or unhen sweekaar karnaa chahie ki unhone barkhaast mantri kaa bachaav karne main galati kii he
 Kumaramangalam said that the language of the blog was derogatory towards women
 congress or bijepi kaa kahana he ki ashutosh ne ek aise aadmi ke saath jo ki ab rape kaa aaropee he, mahatma gandhi kii tulana kar unka apmaan kiya he
 The Congress also performed at the Samadhi of Mahatma Gandhi on Monday morning
 tippaniyan BJP leader Satish Upadhyay told news agency ANI, "ashutosh has hurt the sentiments of the public

 baad main mahila ne sandip kumaar ke khilaaf rape kaa maamla darj karaayaa or shanivaar ko is maamle main unki giraftaar bhi hui
 Former journalist Ashutosh had said in his blog, 'these sexual relationships were established by mutual consent between two adult people, and the media unnecessarily inflamed it
 unhone kaha, 'aap' ne sandip kumaar ko party kii 'chhavi bachaae' rakhane ke liye nishkasit kiya he
 '' unhone apane kollam main yah bhi bataaya tha ki kaise bhartiya rajanetaaon kii yon aadaten itihaas main saarvajanik chintaa yaa jaanch kaa vishay nahin rahi hai
 Lalita Kumaramangalam, chairperson of the National Commission for Women, told NDTV that she is hopeful that Ashutosh will meet her on Thursday as per the order and should acknowledge that she has made a mistake in defending the sacked minister
 ' kumarmangalam ne kaha ki blog kii bhashaa mahilaon ke prati apmanjanak thi
 Congress and BJP say that Ashutosh has insulted Mahatma Gandhi by comparing him with a man who is now accused of rape

 The comments bijepi netaa satish upaadhyaay ne samachar agency eenai se kaha, "ashutosh ne janata kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat kiya he

 The top management was collecting bonuses in the name of the best work when IL&FS and its hundreds of small companies, the country's largest infra-lender group, ie road bridge and building company, were drowning
 aankade or dastavej bataate hai ki is dauraan chairman ravi parthasarathi ne to apni selary 177 fisadi tak badwa lee
 India Today's data intelligence team diu, after analyzing the company's annual report and the report of government investigative agencies, found that the top management partner of the group continued to reap the benefits from the fake profits of its partner, Ifin, as well as a huge amount for the company's meetings
 Recovered the commission
 bandarbaant kaa asal khelkahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti ab farjivade kii ek or nai parat khulne vaali he
 il&fs's top management partner was also looking after ifin
 company non banking bijness main thi
 Its job was to give loans, but the management did not do it properly, as a result many companies from ifin also took loans which could not repay the loans and went bankrupt
 ab paise vasuulne ke bajaae IL&FS ne apane balance shit main chhedchhad kii or bainkon se or karj le liya, yahi nahin is paise ko munafa bataate hue yphin ne apni holding company IL&FS ko kareeb 600 karod rupye kaa dividend diya
 For the 'hard work' done to earn profits, the board gave a bonus of 76 crores for itself in five years
 jise bijness kii bhashaa main ‘parformens related pe’ yani piarpy kehete hai
 Those who distributed the bonus themselves included Ramesh Bawa, Hari Shankaran, Arun Saha, Vaibhav Kapoor and k Ramchand apart from Chairman Ravi Parthasarathy
 holding company yani IL&FS ke kartadhartaaon ne ifin ko farji munafa dikhaane ke liye kaha
 Surprisingly, ignoring the rules related to the NPA of the Reserve Bank, the profit sheet was shown in the balance sheet by taking loans so that it can be earned by another way
 ye paisa aam janata kaa tha
 from banks by selling commercial paper to loans and mutual funds 
 ifin gaiyr banking bijness main thi isliye keval arabiai ke hisaab se jaruri rigerv ke company ke khaaton main rakhkar company kii sari puunji dividend ke jariye holding company ko de di gai, yani ab ifin ko lone main mila sara paisa IL&FS ke khate main chalaa gaya
 Amarjit Chopra, former president and accounting expert of ICAI, a regulating chartered accountancy, told India Today, "I think this is the most serious case of account rigging and window dressing
 bina vaazib munaafe ke dividend diya gaya
 In the same way, commissions and bonuses are divided without actual loss
 in sabhi paison kii vasuuli honi chahie
 Despite the wastage, ifin also distributed commissions to six top management executives
 aadhikarik rup se 2013 ke baad ifin main ravi parthasarathi kaa hastkshep keval noting tak simit tha
 But the investigating agencies found that at the practical level the situation was completely opposite
 parthasarathi ifin ke har bade kaamkaaj main dakhal dete the
 Parthasarathy and the rest of the top management made iphin's policy and guideline in such a way that they would benefit personally

 Ifin's long-term borrowing of more than four thousand crore rupees was also an indication that the company will not survive, but the big question is whether the government will be able to recover the submerged money
 kya janata kii gadhi kamai luutane vaale apane kiye kii sajaa paaenge? Although the capital of the country, Delhi has always been on the radar of criminals, but once again the Delhi Police has gone to sleep after the weapons of the Delhi Police were caught with big weapons
 rajdhani main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle dilli police kii special cell ne chaar hathiyaar taskaron ko giraftaar kiya he or unke paas se ek bahut bada hathiyaaron kaa jakhira baraamad kiya he jisamen 64 pistaul, ek single bairal gan, 60 kaartoos or 69 magazine shaamil hai
 In fact, special cell information was received that two weapons are going to come with smuggler weapons in Nizamuddin area of delhi
 uske baad dilli police ne nizamuddin ilaake main trep lagaaya or bachchau singh or ajay salve naam ke do hathiyaar taskaron ko giraftaar kar liya or jab unki talaashi lee gai to police ke bhi hosh ud gaye kyonki unke paas police ne 35 pistaul baraamad kii
 Simultaneously, on the basis of another intelligence, the Delhi Police arrested Ranjit Singh alias Neetu Jat, a weapon smuggler, by trapping him from ISBT area of delhi and when he was interrogated, he informed another of his companions
 jise police ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Special Cell's DCP Pramod Singh Kushwaha said that the arms smugglers who have been arrested used to supply arms to criminals in delhi-ncr in the same manner for the last several years
 giraftaar bachchau singh to pichley 15 saalon se hathiyaar supplai karata tha saath hi usapar hatya, lut or arms act ke kai mukademe darj hai
 On the other hand, Ranjit Singh alias Neetu Jat, arrested from ISBT, was becoming a big name in the world of arms smuggling for the last about 1 year
 jise samay rahete dilli police ne giraftaar kar liya
 According to the accused in the police custody, the weapons which are handed over to the Special Cell of the Delhi Police are of very high quality
 65 hathiyaaron main 64 pistal he or ek single bairal gan or 60 kaartoos he
 The 64 pistols have 24 single shot and 40 cm automatic pistols
 jo quality main behad awwal darje kii he
 Let us tell you that arms smugglers used to buy a pistol from UP and Madhya Pradesh for about 8 to 10 thousand rupees and sell it to criminals for about 20 to 25 thousand
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab dilli police kii special cell ne itnaa bada hathiyaaron kaa jakhira baraamad kiya he
 In the past too, many syndicates have been busted in the Special Cell of Delhi Police and arrested in large numbers
 saal 2019 kii hi baat karen to kareeb 6 sindicket kaa dilli police kii special cell ne pardaafash kiya he or kareeb 300 hathiyaar baraamad kiye hai
 The police are constantly interrogating the four arms smugglers

 Bollywood actor Salman Khan is now coming to the big screen with his new film Dabangg-3
 is film kaa trailor bhi jari ho chukaa he lekin ab is film se judaa chaunkaa dene vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Salman Khan has often played additional roles as a singer and choreographer in his films, but has gone a step ahead in Wahdabang-3
 trailor par agar ek najar daali jaae to pataa chalegaa ki unhen screenple riter ke taur par credit diya gaya he
 On the other hand, Dilip Shukla, whose name was associated with the part of previous Dabangg films, has been removed
 vahiin ek sutara kaa kahana he ki dilip shukla ko screenple main prabhudeva or alok upaadhyaay ke saath 11 sitambar ko jari kiye gaye moshan tiger main vidhivat shrey diya gaya tha
 However, when the trailer was released a month later, Dileep was replaced by Salman Khan
 nae screenple ke taur par salmaan khan, prabhudeva or alok upaadhyaay ko credit diya gaya
 At the same time, his name has been retained in the dialogue credit
 likhe kai mashhoor dialogdilip shukla ne damini or ghayal jaisi filmon ke liye dialog likhe hai
 He says, 'I have written dialogues like' two and a half kilos of hand 'and' date on date '
 agar mujhe is tarah ke gunvattta vaale kaam karne ke baad sammanit nahin kiya gaya, to main apane naam ko credit se hataae jane se kyon pareshaan hounga?' Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes that due to the new rules of one-day cricket, the attitude of most teams will change and the batsmen may not dominate the bowlers in the early overs
 dhoni ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf champions trophy ke udghaatan match kii purv sandhya par patrakaron se kaha, mujhe lagata he ki adhiktar timen apane ravaiye main badlaav karengi
 They would prefer to save their wickets in the first 10 overs, as the new ball can help the bowlers
 unhone kaha, nae niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad do nai gendon kaa upyog kiya jayega or iske alaava 30 gaj ke ghere ke andar ek kshetrarakshak kam rahegaa, jiskaa matlab he ki yadi aapke haath main wicket bache hai, to aap vastav main paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaakar adhik ran bana sakate hai
 Dhoni praised his bowlers for putting Australia on 65 for the second practice match
 unhone kaha, pichley match main nai gend se hamane shandaar pradarshan kiya
 He was getting a lot of swing, but at the same time balls were also very fast
 gend of stump ke mark ke kaaphi kareeb se hokar guzar rahi thi jo ki mahatvapurn he
 All our bowlers did that
 yadi aap sampurna tasviir par gaur karen, to main samajhataa hum ki yah acha pradarshan he
 Before leaving India, Dhoni insisted on having five specialist bowlers and he reiterated this
 tippaniyan "due to the new rules, it is very difficult to play with four bowlers and trust a caretaker
" dhoni ne dinesh karthik kii bhi jamkar tarif kii, jinhone donon abhyaas maichon main shatak jamaaye
 He said, i have always believed that he is a batsman who can bat really well in the middle order
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki vah acha ranor he
 He understands the situation well and a batsman who can play long innings which is important for the middle-order batsman
 meri nijee raay he ki uskaa hona team ke liye acha he
 Dhoni said, he is a player who can bat at any number 3, 4 or 5, but not at number six or seventh
 isliye main khilaadiyon ko unke pasandida sthaan par bhejne kii koshish karuunga, lekin yah bhi dekhuunga kii ki team kii jarurat kya he
 India's openers Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan may not have scored, but the captain has full faith in them
 unhone kaha, hamen unke sampurna pradarshan ko dekhne or chintaa nahin karne kii jarurat he
 It is not right to speculate whether they will perform well or not
 dhoni ne kaha ki bhartiya tej gendbaajon kii bhoomika ahm rahegi, jisamen umesh yadav kaa pradarshan mahatvapurn hoga
 "I think most teams will change their attitude," Dhoni told reporters on the eve of the inaugural Champions Trophy match against South Africa
 ve pehle 10 overon main apane wicket bachaae rakhane ko tarjeeh denge, kyonki nai gend se gendbaajon ko madad mil sakati he
 "two new balls will be used after the new rules come into force and there will be less of a fielder inside the 30-yard circle, which means that if you have wickets left in your hand, you will actually benefit from the conditions," he said
 Can lift and score more runs
 australia ko duusare abhyaas match main 65 ran par dher karne ke liye dhoni ne apane gendbaajon kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, in the last match, we performed brilliantly with the new ball
 unhen bahut swing mil rahi thi, lekin iske saath hi gendon main kaaphi teji bhi thi
 The ball was passing very close to the off-stump mark which is important
 hamaare sabhi gendbaajon ne aisa kiya
 If you look at the whole picture, i think it is a good performance
 bharat se ravaanaa hone se pehle dhoni ne paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko rakhane par jor diya tha or unhone phir se yah baat doharaai
 The comments unhone kaha, nae niyamon ke kaaran chaar gendbaajon ke saath khelnaa or kaamchalaoo gendbaaj par bharosa karnaa bahut mushkil he
 Dhoni also praised Dinesh Karthik, who scored centuries in both practice matches
 unhone kaha, meraa hameshaa maanata rahaa hum ki vah aisa ballebaaj he, jo madhyakram main vastav main bahut acchhee ballebaaji kar saktaa he
 The reason for this is that he is a good runner
 vah sthiti ko acchhee tarah se bhaanp letaa he or vah aisa ballebaaj jo lambii pari khel saktaa he jo ki madhyakram ke ballebaaj ke liye mahatvapurn he
 My personal opinion is that it is good for the team
 dhoni ne kaha, vah aisa khilaadi he, jo 3, 4 yaa 5 kisi bhi number par ballebaaji kar saktaa he, lekin chathe yaa saatven number par nahin
 So i will try to send the players to their favorite place, but will also see what the team needs
 bharat ke salaami ballebaajon murali vijay or shikhar dhawan ne bhale hi ran nahin banaae, lekin captain ko un par puraa vishwaas he
 He said, we need to watch his entire performance and not worry
 yah kayaas lagaana sahi nahin he ki ve acha pradarshan karenge yaa nahin
 Dhoni said that the role of Indian fast bowlers will be important, in which Umesh Yadav's performance will be important
 unhone kaha, nae niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad do nai gendon kaa upyog kiya jayega or iske alaava 30 gaj ke ghere ke andar ek kshetrarakshak kam rahegaa, jiskaa matlab he ki yadi aapke haath main wicket bache hai, to aap vastav main paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaakar adhik ran bana sakate hai

 The youth discussed politics with their family over dinner
 dilli ke logon ke liye raajnneeti par bahes karnaa nai baat nahin he, lekin is baar kuch alag tha
 This time the people of Delhi thought of giving a chance to a new political party and many times they also donated the party with their hard earned money
 kuch maheene baad aise logon ko sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jab unke doston or kareebi logon ne unase kaha- dekha hamane kaha tha naa
 
 
 Many people of Delhi believe that we have disappointed them with our work

 saaf-suthra, eemaandaar shashan or paardarshee funding ke saath aam aadmi party hawa ke tazaa jhonke kii tarah thi
 We never lied and hid nothing
 lekin main ye bhi maanata hum ki hamaare kaam se kuch logon ko thes bhi pahunchi, kyonki aam aadmi party kii jo chhavi he, wo ham sabase badi he
 People were hurt that the party and movement for which they did so much, they left the ground and ran away
 logon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki maine dilli ke mukhyamantri ke pad se istifa loksabhaa chunaav ladakar pradhanmantri banane ke liye diya tha
 But this is wrong
 mukhyamantri ke pad se istifa dene ke fouran baad hi maine dilli main phir se chunaav karaane kii maang kii thi
 Despite being a minority government, the popularity of our government's work was 71%
 lekin dilli ke chunaav main kaaphi der ho rahi thi
 Later we realized that we were too much to trust
 ye ek galati thi, jise ham maanate hai
 But now we have to forget the past and focus on the future
 aakhirkaar agar logon ne hamen shashan karne kaa janadesh diya he, to wo hamase dhairyapurvak kaam karne kii ummid karenge

 zyaadaatar logon ke liye aam aadmi party samvidhan se mili adhikaar or swatantraaa ke saath jivan vyateet karne kaa ek mauka he
 In the last election, we had promised that we would ensure that bribes and policemen do not have to pay weeks to do business and will work to save the country from blatant theft of precious national resources
 ham sabhi ek sthaayee or uttaradaayi sarkaar chaahate hai
 We want an environment where there is no bribery, people can do their work honestly, every child gets a better life and it is assured that he is safe
 aam aadmi party ho yaa na ho, kejariwal ho yaa na ho, ham aisa hi maahaul chaahate hai
 At any given time people have the same desire for a government
 aam aadmi party ne ek team or parivaar banakar kai chunautiyon kaa saamana kiya he
 There is no social or economic bond in this family
 ham dilli ke log hai or ham jaanate hai ki dilli kii samasyaon ko kaise dur kiya ja saktaa he
 We understand that the people of Delhi want to feel that their government is working for them
 ham samajhate hai ki dilli ke log chaahate he ki ham centre sarkaar ke saath milakar rachanaatmak kaam karen
 We understand that the Delhi government should be honest as well as stable, a government that is ready to make Delhi equal to other big cities of the world from the first day, such a government that listens to the needs of every section of people and their needs Work according to study tour ke naam paravidesh bhraman ko gaye upi ke vidhayak nirdhaarit samay se pehle swadesh laut rahe hai

 When the National Selection Committee headed by MSK Prasad meets at the end of the week to decide on the Indian team for the TRAI T20 series to be held in Sri Lanka from March 6 to 18 next month, it will consist of fast bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jaspreet Bumrah
 The subject of workload is expected to be discussed
 viraat kohli ne south africa main sabhi match khele hai, lekin unka maamla anya se thodaa alag hoga, kyonki unhen aaraam dene kaa faisla khud unpar nirbhar hoga
 a top BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity, "if Virat wants rest, he will get rest
" viraat ke maamle main, vahi faisla karenge ki vah iske liye team main shaamil hona chaahate hai yaa nahin
 The official said, "but you can't say anything, he might want to play in the T20 series because it is the last tournament of the season
" ek baar toornament khatm ho gaya to uske paas indian premier lig (IPL) se pehle 15 din kaa khaali samay hoga
 'this Kangaroo made a huge record before the IPL, Australia became the champion, when the chief selector Prasad was asked about it, he refused to comment
 lekin, yah to samaj aata he ki jab bhi chayan baithak hogi to tej gendbaaji unit ke bare main charchaa hogi
 However Bhuvi and Bumrah are likely to be given the necessary rest in view of the long season ahead of the IPL
 ye donon bharat ke sabhi formats main shandaar pradarshan karne vaale gendbaaj hai
 Bhubaneswar has bowled around 100 overs, including the Test and ODI series
 agar vah tii-20 international main apana puraa kota gendbaaji karte hai, to unke kul 112 over ho jaaenge
 Pujaralekin, who will make a special appearance in the county to make the tour on England tour, has not bowled more than Bumrah, who is one of the three players to play all the matches on the tour with Kohli and Hardik Pandya
 agar bumraah teen tii-20 main apane puure cote gendbaaji karte hai, to vah 166 over se zyada gendbaaji kar lenge jo international cricket ko dekhte hue kaaphi zyada he
 If India are to play 63 international matches including 30 odis in the upcoming season, Bumrah's fitness will be a priority for both the selectors and the team management
 agar bumraah or bhuvi ko aaraam diya jaataa he, to shardul thakur or jayadev unadakat ke nai gend kii jimmedaari uthaane kii ummid he
 Yorker specialist Basil Thampi from Kerala was a reserve player during the domestic T20 series against Sri Lanka and if either Bhuvaneshwar or Bumrah is given rest, or both, he could probably make a comeback
 baari barish ke bich tihaad jail se mayapuri or phir rajghat se sidhe ramlila maidan tak kaa safar kareeb teen ghante main puraa karne ke baad anna ne kaha, angrejon ke jane ke saath hi hamen aazaadee mili, lekin desh se bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua
 
 
 
 yah aazaadee kii duusari ladaai he
 This is the beginning of a revolution
 desh ke sabhi logon ne ye mashaal jalaai he
 Never let it go out
 chaahe main rahun yaa naa rahun
 
 
 The torch kept on burning
 unhone kaha, hamen sirf lokapal hi nahin, balki puraa parivartan laana he
 Such changes have to be brought in the country for justice to the poor
 hajaare ne kaha, jab tak janalokapal vidheyak paarit nahin hoga, tab tak ham ramlila maidan nahin chodenge
 Anna said that the way Japan rose from the pile of ashes again
 hamen bhi usee tarah uthanaa he
 If the youth of the country wakes up, the future of this country is bright
 unhone kaha ki jin gaddaaron ne is desh ko lutaa he, ham unhen bardaasht nahin karenge
 Earlier, despite being on the fourth day of his fast, Anna, who is looking healthy, addressed his long-awaited supporters there after he walked out of the jail premises
 unhone kaha ki swatantraaa ke duusare sangharsh kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 When Hazare came out of the jail premises, police officers were also present with him
 vah 67 ghante tihaad jail main rahe
 a small platform was built outside the jail premises to address his supporters
 beete mangalvaar subah police ne unhen giraftaar kar liya tha, lekin jab sarkaar ne unki bina shart rihaai ke aadesh diye, tab bhi unhone baahar aane se inkaar kar diya
 In his brief speech, he announced that the aim of his movement is to free the country from corruption
 juluus ke liye ek chote trek par savaar hone se pehle unhone apane samarthakon se apil kii ki ve hinsa nahin karen or saarvajanik sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen
 Despite the rain, the procession with Hazare continued from Tihar Jail towards Rajghat
 rajghat pahunch kar hajaare ne rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii samadhi par shradhanjali arpit kii
 a large number of his supporters were also there
 unka india get sthit amar jawan jyoti jane kaa kaarykram tha, lekin vah rajghat se sidhe ramlila maidan pahunch gaye
 His procession and heavy rains continued till Ramlila Maidan, but the enthusiasm of him and his supporters did not diminish
 gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha, chaar din main meraa vajan teen kilogram kam ho gaya he
 But the movement you are running, is giving me energy
 vajan chaahe 10 kilogram bhi kam kyon nahin ho jaae, hamaara josh kam nahin hoga

 But Duncan Fletcher, the coach of the Indian team, will have to raise his team's morale again so that they can win the last match and end the series with honors
 paanch maichon kii siries main 2-1 se pichhadane ke baavjood bharat ke haath se sabakuch nikal nahin gaya he
 If the Indian team can raise their batting levels, then it is not impossible to win in front of the tired James Anderson and injured Stuart Broad
 bharat ko england kii pichley do siries kii smritiyon ko peeche chhodana padegaa or maujuuda siries ke duusare test match main kiye gaye pradarshan ko yaad karnaa hoga, jisamen unhen jeet mili thi
 Fletcher must first focus on the team's batsmen
 murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaara or ajinkya rahane ne kam se kam sakaaratmak ravaiya jarur dikhaaya he
 Balls going out of the off stump will have to learn to drop them
 viraat kohli ke liye kah sakate hai ki vah kharaab form main chal rahe hai, lekin australia, dakshin africa or newjiland main unka pradarshan unhen ek kushal ballebaaj kii shrenee main rakhata he
 Keep in mind that bad form is a matter of some time
 shikhar dhawan kii gaiyr jimmedaarana ballebaaji ke liye team se unhen baahar kar hi diya gaya he or gautam gambhir ko lambey samay baad team main jagah di gai he
 Gambhir returned to the team without practice, which also reflected his batting
 lekin gambhir vaapasi kii kshamta rakhte hai, jaisaa ki ve newjiland daure par kar chuke hai
 The next and last Test match of the series is to be held at The Oval Stadium in London
 england kaa sabase purana test maidan da ovel agast maheene main ballebaaji ke liye kaaphi upyukt mana jaataa he
 Only on the first day in the morning the fast bowlers and on the last day the spin bowlers get some help from this pitch
 chauthe test main yadi bharat ek atirikt tej gendbaaj ke saath utre to use pich kaa laabh mil saktaa he
 Surely, no other option can be thought of if Ishant Sharma stays healthy
 ballebaaji main or gaharaai dene ke liye pankaj singh kii jagah stfort binni ko team main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Mohammed Samee may prove to be better than Binny as a fast bowler, but neither his bowling has shown that edge in the current series nor can he be expected to bat every time in the Trent Bridge Test
 da ovel test main nimna bhartiya team ko maidan par utaarne kaa suzav diya ja saktaa he- Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain / wicketkeeper), Murali Vijay, Gautam Gambhir, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny or Mohammad Samee, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Varun Aaron and Ishant Sharma
 bhartiya sansadeey itihaas kaa yah pehla mauka hoga jab kendriya mantrimandal main purvi or purvottar ke rajyon kaa ek bhi cabinet mantri nahin he, dilli se purab kii ore chalem to upi main gonda (benny prasad verma) ke baad ek bhi cabinet mantri nahin he
 There are 182 mps in the Lok Sabha from this region
 upie-2 ke sambhavatya aakhri pherbadal ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se behad mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa tha, lekin purvi uttar pradesh ke gonda se aage or bihar, jharkhand, orissa, chhattisgarh, sikkim, meghalaya, arunachal pradesh, assam, nagaland, manipur, mizoram, pashchim bengal or tripura ko congress ne yaa to rajnatik rup se anupjau maanate hue andekha kiya he yaa phir saamaajik sameekaran saadhane main congress vifal rahi he
 However, Congress leaders take the allegations of ignoring East in a very easy way
 congress pravaktaa or rahul gandhi kii team ke ahm sipahasaalar sandip dikshit india today se kehete hai, ''yah ek sanyog ho saktaa he, jaan-boojhkar nahin kiya gaya he
 "he argues in defense of the Manmohan government and the Congress," the government has ministers like Shrikant Jena, Pawan Ghatowar from the east with independent charge
 purvottar se bhi kai mantri banaae gaye hai
 The socio-political-regional balance has to be taken care of in the cabinet, so it should not be seen as a complete representation given in the cabinet, rather than being divided into a cabinet or a minister of state
 ” lekin purab se kisi ko bhi cabinet mantri nahin banaae jane ke sawaal par dikshit kehete hai, ''mantri banaae jate vakt varishthata or anya kai pahaluon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 "but the main opposition party BJP is not digesting the Congress argument
 orissa ke rahane vaale or bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv dharmendra pradhan aarope lagaate hai, ''cabinet pherbadal se saaf ho gaya he ki congress ne sirf andhra, rajasthan, dilli, karnataka jaise rajya main party ke napha-nuksaan ko hi dhyaan main rakhaa he or bengal, orissa, jharkhand, chhattisgarh or samooche purvottar ke rajyon kii upeksha kii he
 "they say," Congress has deliberately ignored the poor and backward province of the country
 ” pradhan to yahaan tak aarope lagaate hai ki manmohan cabinet main purv, purvottar ke saath-saath madhya bharat kii ghor upeksha hui he
 According to him, where there used to be four ministers from Madhya Pradesh during the Vajpayee government, now there are only Kamal Nath in the Congress Raj
 haalanki congress kii daleelon se itar yah bhi ek tathy he ki sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar ke vakt cabinet mantri rahe orissa ke shrikant jena upie sarkaar main mahaj swatantra prabhaar ke mantri bane rahane ko majaboor hai
 He also expressed his displeasure when he was made Minister of State for the first time
 assam ke pawan ghatowar ko bhi 2011 main swatantra prabhaar kaa mantri banaaya gaya tha or is badlaav main unhen padonnati milane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi
 The representation of eastern India was extremely low in the second innings of the Manmohan government anyway
 bengal se pranab mukherjee or mamata banerjee bataur cabinet mantri sarkaar kaa hissaa the
 But now that Mukherjee has become President, Mamata has separated from the government
 purab kii andekhi kii ahm vajah yah bhi ho sakati he ki assam ko chhodkar baaki anya rajyon bihar, orissa, jharkhand, bengal main congress mukhya rajnatik mukaable se baahar ho chuki he
 The Congress has its roots in Bihar and Orissa
 jaahir he ki purvi or purvottar bharat kii andekhi congress ke liye nuksaandeh sabit ho sakati he

 whats ap ne kashmir par jitne professor kashmir ke bheetar paidaa kar diye hai, usase zyada kashmir ke baahar
 Things are getting worse due to the facts being created through Kashmir through Whats up
 vahi haal shesh bharat main bhi he
 Because of whats up university, every other man has an opinion on Kashmir
 main kashmir nahin jaanata
 i also find it tuff from chemistry
 lekin baaki aisa nahin kehete kyonki sabane trakon par likhaa wo sandesh pard liya he- doodh maangoge to kheer denge, kashmir maangoge to cheer denge
 Kheer will give and rip off the principle, how much solution of the Kashmir problem was solved, only the expert experts of TV channels can tell
 bich-bich main jab trek formula fail karata he to logon ko vaajapeyi formula yaad aata he
 Insaniyat, Jamhuriyat and Kashmiriyat - This is the Ayurvedic medicine of Kashmir problem
 jab allopathy fail ho jaati he to ise yaad kiya jaataa he
 Prime Minister Modi has also been referring to this medicine of Vajpayee
 mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti achaanak jor-jor se kehane lagi hai ki vaajapeyi ji ke time main bhi baatcheet hui, el ke adwani dipti piem the tab hurriyat ke saath baat hui
 We have to take it forward from where Vajpayee ji left, otherwise there is no chance of improving the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 koi chance nahin he kaa kya matlab he
 Is Mehbooba asking to talk to Hurriyat or separatists? The responsibility of humanity, Jamuriyat and Kashmiriyat is also on his government, is his government not able to distribute this medicine
 nae-nae tathy gadhe ja rahe hai, unka muqabla unki sarkaar kyon nahin kar paa rahi he
 In other parts of India, new facts are being created through Whats Up
 mahabuuba mufti ko iskaa upaay khojane ke liye landan jane kii zarurat nahin he
 Mehbooba Mufti has already talked about the conversation, so whom should she talk to? jis hurriyat ko lekar tivi channelon or raajnneetik pratikriyaaon main pakistan kaa agent banaakar pesh kiya gaya, har raat aapke koon main ubaal paidaa kiya, kya hota agar mahabuuba kah detii ki hurriyat yaa algaavvaadiyon se baat honi chahie tab sahyogi bijepi kii kya pratikriya hoti
 Will the BJP agree? bandook chalaane kii baat hoti he to tivi ke export samajha dete hai ki kis par sidhe bandook chalaani he
 Whether it is a conversation, those who are talking do not know who to talk to
 mahabuuba ne kaha ki kab tak aap apane logon ke saath aisa karenge
 He should also have told what is happening to his people right now
 kashmir ko lekar kisi bhi baatcheet main is baat ko shaamil karnaa zaruri he ki desh main kashmir ko lekar kya ho rahaa he
 Actually, that opinion has become more important than the opinion of Kashmir
 is sthiti ko banane main export or ankaron ne bahut mehnat kii he
 For him, he is a stoning terrorist and an army criminal, action should be taken in the same language
 lekin mahabuuba mufti ke bayaan ko dhyaan se suna to laga ki do tarah ke patharbaz hai
 There are 2-3 reasons for stonewalling
 ek to jo ladke hai jo khafa hai, duusare wo jinako jaanboojh kar uksaaya jaataa he
 If there is discussion on this, then there will be some way out
 kya ye 'hamaare' patharbaz or 'paraaye' patharbaz vaala koi formula he
 Mehbooba's statement is for the army or for the government
 samjhaute kii jagah takaraav kii niti kiski he, kya mahabuuba mufti apane sahyogi bijepi kii nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahi hai
 Kashmiri students studying in the rest of India have to bear the brunt of what is happening in Kashmir
 tippaniyan Hashim Sophie, a student of Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, was even called a terrorist by his classmates
 sofi santhaan chhodane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Eight Kashmiri students of Mewar University in Rajasthan also faced this
 unhen bhi aatankwaadi kaha gaya
 The stoner said
 meerut main ek poster laga diya gaya jisamen likhaa tha bhartiya sena par pathar maarane vaale kashmiriyon kaa bahishkaar, kashmiriyon upi chodo varanaa
 
 
 
 
 Police has sent Amit Jani, the national president of the National Navnirman Sena, to jail
 amit jaani ne hi 20 april ko poster lagaae the
 Meerut District Magistrate and SSP have met Kashmiri students and have also promised security
 isse pehle grih mantri rajnath singh ne sabhi mukhyamantriyon se kaha tha ki ve kashmiri chaatro ko tang kiye jane kii ghatana ko roke
 The Prime Minister has also appealed to the Chief Ministers
 ravivaar ko niti ayog kii baithak main mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne sabhi mukhyamantriyon se kaha ki kashmiri chaatr bhi aapke apane hi bachche hai
 These children go to Kashmir as ambassadors of your states
 aap unase baat kiijie
 Take care of them

 aap unase baat kiijie
 Take care of them
 aap kabhi kabhi unhen bulaakar baat bhi kar sakate hai
 What does it mean to have no chance? kya mahabuuba hurriyat yaa algaavvaadiyon se baat karne ke liye kah rahi hai? insaaniyat, jamhuriyat or kashmiriat kii zimmedaari unki sarkaar par bhi to he, kya unki sarkaar is dawa kaa vitaran nahin kar paa rahi he
 New facts are being created, why their government is not able to compete with them
 bharat ke duusare hisse main bhi whats ap ke zariye nae-nae tathy gadhe ja rahe hai
 Mehbooba Mufti does not have to go to London to find a solution
 mahabuuba mufti ne baatcheet kii baat kar hi di he to kisase baat ho wo bhi kar deni chahie thi
 The Hurriyat, which was presented as an agent of Pakistan in TV channels and political reactions, made your blood boil every night, what would happen if Mehbooba would have said that the Hurriyat or the separatists should have spoken then what would be the reaction of the allied BJP
 kya bijepi maan jaaegi
 When it comes to gunfire, TV experts explain who to fire a gun directly
 baatcheet ho, baatcheet ho karne vaale yahi nahin bataate ki kisase baatcheet ho
 Mehbooba said how long you will do this with your people
 unhen yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki apane logon ke saath abhi aisa kya ho rahaa he
 It is important to include in any conversation about Kashmir what is happening in the country about Kashmir
 darasal wo raay kashmir kii raay se zyaada mahatvapurn ho gai he
 Experts and anchors have worked hard to create this situation
 unke liye pathar chalaane vaala aatankwaadi he or sena kaa apradhi he, uske saath usee bhashaa main karrwai honi chahie
 But after listening carefully to the statement of Mehbooba Mufti, it seemed that there are two types of stones
 patharbazi ke liye 2-3 vajahen hai
 One is the boys who are angry, the other are those who are deliberately provoked
 is par discshan hoga to koi naa koi rasta zarur nikal aayega
 Is this a formula for our 'stone' and 'foreign' stone
 mahabuuba kaa yah bayaan sena ke liye he yaa sarkaar ke liye
 Whose policy is confrontation rather than compromise, is Mehbooba Mufti criticizing the policies of her ally BJP
 kashmir main jo kuch ho rahaa he uskaa khamiyaaza shesh bharat main padhane nikle kashmiri chaatro ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he

 At the NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti told all the Chief Ministers that Kashmiri students are also children of their own

 Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharti, while mocking himself as a BJP candidate for the post of Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh, said that till now he has not taken any decision about coming back to BJP
 uma ne kaha, ‘na jane kaise yah charchaa chal padi he ki main uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii taraf se mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaar ke rup main pesh kii jane vaali hum
 This is the biggest joke of the year 2010
 logon ko isse saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 Also because so far i have not taken any decision about coming back to BJP
 ’ unhone spasht kiya ki bhaajapa netaaon ke saath jab kabhi unki baat hui thi to unhone
 (uma) had spoken of becoming a candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and not in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which are due in 2012
 uma ne kaha ki pichley dinon apni maa samaan bhabhi kii maut ho jane se vah kaaphi dukhi thi or kuch samay ke liye raajnneeti se virat ho gayi thi
 Uma said, 'he had talks with senior BJP leader LK Advani and President Nitin Gadkari and both expressed their desire to bring him back as party official in BJP
 magar unke is prastaav par maine kaha tha ki main apni party (bhartiya janashakti party) ke saath rajg main ek ghatak ke rup main shaamil hona chaahati hum
 i have not yet taken any decision about rejoining the BJP
 ’sabhi raajnneetik dalon se bhrashtachar or raajnneeti ke apradheekaran par apana rukh spasht karne kii maang karte hue uma bharti ne kaha ki philhal kuch or dinon tak vah sakriy raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chaahati hai
 On the statement made by the senior BJP leader about his return to the BJP, Uma said, 'advani ji is like my father who is saying, he is right, but what i am saying is also right
 ’ uma ramalala ke darshan ke liye ayodhya jane vaali thi, magar aaj subah hi madhya pradesh main apni ek kareebi kii maut kii soochna ke baad vah laut gayin
 At the same time, Uma Bharti also targeted Rahul Gandhi, accusing the Congress of being an 'irresponsible' political party
 uma bharti ne aarope lagaaya, ‘congress ek gaiyr-jimmedaar party he
 It first conducts terrorism and then asks for votes in his name
 ’ unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘rahul digvijay singh se note(likhit bayaan) lete hai, rahul pehle padhaa karen
 Take a class from us
 vah ek achche parivaar ke jimmedaar vyakti hai
 They should avoid irresponsible statements
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh rahul gandhi ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke virodh main bayaan dene ko padhaate hai
 Describing Singh as accustomed to making irresponsible statements, Uma said that Rahul should read about the history of the Sangh before comparing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh with SIMI
 unhone hindu sanghathanon ke bare main rahul kii kathith tippaniyon kii aalochana karte hue kaha, ‘jawahar laal nehru ne kashmir ke mudde par sangh kaa sahyog liya tha or yahaan tak ki ganatantr diwas parade main sangh ke swayamsevako ne bhaag liya tha
 This is a historical fact that should be known to Rahul Gandhi
 ’ Playing his second ODI, Bilal Asif's five-wicket haul as an off-spinner and a 38-run innings as an opener later, Pakistan won the third and Zimbabwe the third one-day match by seven wickets with 96 balls to spare
 is tarah usne teen maichon kii siries 2-1 se apane naam kii
 Asif was included in the ODI squad at the initiative of Test captain misbah-ul-haq, as he believes that this off-spinner can play an important role against England's left-handed batsmen
 asif unke vishwaas par khare utre or unhone 25 ran dekar paanch wicket liye, jisase zimbabwe keval 38
 Piled on for 161 runs in 5 overs
 baad main asif pari kaa aagaaj karne ke liye utre or unhone 39 gendon par chah chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se 38 ran banane ke saath hi ahamed shahzad (32) ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 58 ran kii saajhedaari bhi kii
 After these two outs, Asad Shafik (38 not out) and in-form Shoaib Malik (34 not out) put on an unbroken 58-run partnership for the fourth wicket, which helped Pakistan reach the target by losing three wickets in 34 overs
 Stayed
 tippaniyan Earlier Zimbabwe started brilliantly after losing the toss
 salaami ballebaaj chaamu chibhabha (48) or richmond mutumbami (67) ne pehle wicket ke liye 89 ran jode
 Asif broke the partnership in his fifth over by catching Chibhabha off his own ball
 30-varshiya asif kaa yah pakistan kii taraf se doosraa match tha
 He made his second ODI debut against Zimbabwe
 unhen saathi spinner imaad wasim kaa acha saath mila, jinhone 36 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 Pakistan had earlier made a clean sweep in the T020 series
 vah vanade siries ke bhi teenon match jeet saktaa tha, lekin doosraa vanade kharaab roshni ke kaaran puraa nahin ho paaya or zimbabwe ne dakworth louis paddati se paanch ran se jeet darj karke siries baraabar kara di thi
 Pakistan won the first ODI by 131 runs
 asif ko test captain misabah ul haq kii pahal par vanade team main shaamil kiya gaya, kyonki unka maananaa he ki england ke baayen haath ke ballebaajon ke khilaaf yah of spinner ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he

 britain ko european union main rahanaa chahie yaa nikal janaa chahie ise lekar britain main matdaan shuru ho gaya he
 Over 465
5 million voters are participating in this referendum
 kahin matdaan zoron par he, kahin dhimaa he
 The results of this referendum are to come on 24 June
 european union ke 27 sadsy deshon ke karodon nagarikon kii nigaah britain main chal rahe matdaan par he ki union kaa 28 waan sadsy great britain kya faisla karata he
 a similar referendum took place in the year 2014, when there was a question as to whether Scotland should be separated from Britain
 uskaa faisla to britain main bane rahane ke paksh main aayaa lekin european union ke bare main kya faisla hoga
 This is the third nationwide referendum in the history of Britain
 chaar maheene se vahaan raajnneetik dalon se lekar tarah tarah ke saamaajik dharmik sanghathan abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 Some are in favor of leaving the European Union and some are in favor of remaining
 inhen angrezi main live campan or remean campan kaha ja rahaa he
 Voting will be done by Thursday morning and results will be thereafter
 jise bhi pachaas fisadi se adhik vot milegaa vahi faisla hoga
 The media there has become a workout like the Indian media about what will be the result
 puure abhiyaan ke tarah tarah ke sawaalon ko sirf haa yaa naan main samet kar survey kiye ja rahe hai or dikhaaye ja rahe hai
 As elections are held in India, we the media now leave other issues, who will become the Prime Minister or who will become the Chief Minister? isi main chunaav biit jaataa he bich bich main do chaar sting aaparishan or dal badalu netaaon kii khabaren chunavi market main chaa jaati hai
 There are many forms of British media too
 yah main isliye bataa rahaa hum taaki aap ek darshak or loktantr ke hissedaar ke rup main samaj saken ki media aapke loktantric charitra ko kaise badal rahaa he
 How is he covering you in the grooves of yes or no through his survey? loktantr main aap tay nahin kar rahe hai, media aapako tay kar rahaa he
 Is building you chunaav aate hi media aapako ek kritrim naagarik main badal rahaa he
 i do not know if you make a difference with these things or not
 to hazaraat opinian pole kii baadh ai hui he britain main
 In some, victory is out of the European Union, and in others there is victory
 donon ke bich maton kaa faasla bahut kam he
 Even the right-wing media is raising absurd nationalist questions, while the liberal media is not able to bring out the diversity of issues
 britain bechaini se guzar rahaa he
 Why this uneasiness grew so much that he had to move towards the referendum to break away from the European Union
 agar britain european sangh main bana rahata he to kya chhodane ke pakshadharon ke sawaal samaapt ho jaaenge
 what's the question
 isse pehle ek baat yah jaan lijie ki duniya main mandi chal rahi he
 The recession is also going on in Britain
 ye mandi berojgaare laati he or jivan kii gati ko dhimaa kar detii he
 The result is the logic of all of us, but the ways of reasoning change in such a fatal way that at times democracy itself is in danger
 america main aapane dekha hoga donald trump in bechainiyon ke bahaane kis tarah kii aakraamak baaten kar rahe hai
 They sometimes start saying that Muslims will not allow them to enter America, and sometimes they say that outsiders will not have rights over American jobs
 log yah bhi nahin dekh pate ki trump jaise netaa musalamaanon or gaiyr musmalanon ke liye ek hi baat kah rahe hai
 The New York Times reports that Hillary Clinton admits the US economy has fallen into disarray
 sirf ve hi logon kii hataasha ko apni nitiyon se badal sakati hai
 Hillary says that changing Washington's bureaucracy and corporate will not be easy but will try
 kya vaaki aaj kii duniya main koi netaa he jo karporate ko badal de
 If corporates are producing leaders, then who will produce them? arth sankat ke samay naukarshahi khalanaayak ban jaati he
 It takes a strong leader's call to practice it
 duniya main bahut se majboot netaa aae or gaye magar maujuuda arthniti se lambey samay tak ke liye aarthik sthayitv nahin laa sake
 The economic boom does not last long
 ek desh main nahin tikta he
 Is Obama a weak leader? arthvyavastha netaaon ke fitness se nahin chalati he
 Hillary Clinton did not say that she would forgive the students' debts but would ensure that when the students pass from the college, they are not burdened with debt
 kya aisa ho saktaa he
 If you fail in mathematics also, mind yourself
 agar shiksha puri tarah bazaaru ho jaaegi to mahangi fees kii maar se aap or ham kaise bachenge
 When the rich society of America could not survive, then how would the poor society of India survive
 ramdev kii aushadhi se yaa hamdard kii unani dawaaiyon se
 Hillary Clinton is saying that there is more need to plan than jumlebabies or shiny slogans
 iske liye anubhav kii zarurat he
 If we look carefully, these things of him are also not less than a word
 hillari clinton ne yah bhi kaha he ki ve tex niyamon kaa istemaal kar un companiyon par nigaah rakhengi jo apana kaam baahar ke deshon main bhej dete hai
 Which gives jobs to the people there, not American
 global jagat main har doosraa bada desh naukariyon ke sawaal se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 The same thing that is happening in America is happening in Britain
 european sangh se nikalne ke peeche britain kii sust arthvyavastha or berojgaare bhi bada kaaran he
 British citizens feel that citizens of European Union countries are losing their jobs, citizens from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh living in Britain feel that their people are not getting jobs due to European Union
 koi arthniti ke khot ko nahin samaj rahaa koi naukarshahi main dawa khoj rahaa he to koi european union se nikalne main dawa khoj rahaa he
 An article was published by the Independent newspaper on 16 May 2016
 britain main 2013 se 2016 ke bich garibi badi he
 15
 6 pratishat se badhkar 16
 8 percent
 european union ke deshon kii tulana main britain main garibi bahut zyada he
 Students passing university in the UK have a higher debt burden than students in European Union countries
 2015 main har chaatr par ausat karza 44,500 euro he
 If you translate it into Indian rupees, then you will faint
 ek chaatr par chauwalis lakh rupee kaa karz hota he jab wo uniwarsity se paas karata he
 UK students have more loans than students in New Zealand, Australia, USA
 ye he shiksha ke nijeekaran kaa nateeja
 Governments are engaged in the business of buying and selling weapons with the money of the public and its youth are running out of debt
 britain main asamanta bad rahi he
 There is growing discontent
 isliye is janamat sangrah ko ek najariye yaa ek chashme se dekhnaa thik nahin rahegaa
 We have to see what the working class is thinking
 yuva kyon aisa soch rahaa he
 Why are women asking to leave the European Union? kuch voton ke antar se bhale britain european sangh main rah jaae magar jo sawaal uth rahe hai kya unka jawaab ye janamat sangrah de rahaa he
 There is a crisis, but on the pretext of this crisis, some leaders are saying such things which have no relation with the solution
 sirf iyu se nikal jane kaa faisla hataasha yaa tatkaal gusse ko shant kar saktaa he magar samaadhaan kya hoga iskaa koi blueprint kisi ke paas nahin he
 In Britain, the rich are as rich as they are in India, as in America
 indipentand akhbaar main institute aaf phiscal study kii ek report chhapi he jiske anusaar agar ek amir or ek saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke chaatr, ek hi vishvavidhyalay se, ek hi course se degree lekar nikalate hai tab bhi amir chaatr zyaada paise kama rahaa hota he
 Compared to ordinary students
 haalat yah he ki ladkiyaan skool se lekar kalege main behatar pradarshan karti hai wo bhi ladakon kii tulana main kam kama rahi hoti hai
 Why do we not investigate these reasons in times like referendum
 duusari taraf kya is masale ke bahaane ham is global daur main rashtrawaad kii dharna ko lekar nae sire se soch samaj sakate hai
 Regardless of how effective the European Union is, it is a corporate nationalism
 jo sadsy deshon kii janata ke prati javabdeh nahin he
 Member countries send some of their elected members to the EU
 union kaa ek president hota he or mantrimandal bhi
 There is a kind of global government because hundreds of rules made by it apply to member countries
 tippaniyan The European Union may solve practical difficulties of doing business, but does it represent democratic aspirations
 kya in sawaalon ke maddenjar janamat sangrah ke peeche chhipe kaarnon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Are cultural and community identity crises emerging somewhat differently due to this
 europe ke bheetar algaavvaadi andolan is janamat sangrah ko alag tareeke se dekh rahe hai
 Like Catalonia wants to separate from Spain
 vahaan ke algaavvaadi chaahate hai ki britain sangh se nikalne kaa faisla kare
 Spain is threatening that if Britain comes out then it will have a negative impact on citizens who are working in different countries of the European Union
 ek dilachasp abhyaas to he hi ye janamat sangrah
 In a country like India, questions of nationalism and sovereignty are being decided by protest demonstrations by two or four organizations
 britain main karodon log matdaan ke zariye is sawaal kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 People of India who dream of going to London, to settle down and do jobs, have already settled many lakhs of people
 unke liye janamat sangrah kya myne rakhata he
 We will talk in prime time on whether this referendum will change the European Union or what Britain has changed
 britain ke itihaas kaa yah teesraa rashtravyapee janamat sangrah he
 For four months, there have been various types of social religious organizations campaigning from political parties
 koi europiin sangh se nikalne kaa pakshdhar he to koi bane rahane kaa pakshdhar
 These are being called live campaign and remain campaign in English
 guuruuvaar subah tak matdaan hoga or uske baad nattejey aaenge
 Whoever gets more than fifty percent of the vote will decide
 nateeja kya hoga ise lekar vahaan kaa media bhi bhartiya media kii tarah kasaratbaaz ho gaya he
 Like the whole campaign, the questions are being surveyed and shown only by including yes or no
 jaise bharat main chunaav hote hai ham media vaale ab anya muddon ko chhod koun banegaa pradhanmantri yaa koun banegaa mukhyamantri karne lagate hai
 In this, the election is passed, in the middle two to four sting operations and the news of the Dal Balu leaders are covered in the electoral market
 british media ke bhi kai rup dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 i am saying this so that you, as an audience and shareholder of democracy, understand how the media is changing your democratic character
 wo kaise apane tamaam survey ke zariye aapako haa yaa naa ke khaanche main samet rahaa he
 In democracy, you are not deciding, the media is deciding you
 aapako garh rahaa he
 The media is turning you into an artificial citizen as soon as the election comes
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aapako in baton se fark bhi padataa he yaa nahin
 So there is a flood of Hazard Opinion Polls in Britain
 kisi main european union se baahar hone kii jeet he to kisi main bane rahane waalon kii jeet he
 There is very little difference of opinion between the two
 vahaan kaa bhi dakshinpanthi media betuke rashtravaadi sawaalon ko uthaa rahaa he to udaaravaadi media muddon kii vividhta ko saamne nahin laa paa rahaa he
 Britain is undergoing restlessness
 yah bechaini itani kyon bad gai ki use european sangh se alag hone ke liye janamat sangrah kii taraf badhanaa padaa
 If Britain remains in the European Union, the question of whether to leave will end
 sawaal kya he
 Before this, one thing is to know that there is a slowdown in the world
 britain main bhi mandi chal rahi he
 This recession brings unemployment and slows down the pace of life
 nateeja ham sabake tark to hote hai magar tark karne ke tareeke itane ghaatak tareeke se badal jate hai ki kai baar loktantr hi khatare main padane lagata he
 In America, you must have seen what kind of aggressive things Donald Trump is doing on the pretext of these restless people
 ve kabhi kehane lagate hai ki musalamaanon ko america main ghusane nahin denge to kabhi kehete hai ki america naukariyon par bahari logon kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 People also do not see that leaders like Trump are saying the same thing to Muslims and non-muslims
 neuyark times main khabar he ki hillari clinton ne mana he ki america arthvyavastha avyavashtha kaa shikaar ho gai he
 Only they can change people's frustration with their policies
 hillari kahati hai ki washington kii naukarshahi or karporate ko badalanaa aasaan nahin magar prayaas karengi
 Is there really a leader in today's world who transforms the corporate
 karporate hi to netaa paidaa kar rahe hai to unhen koun paidaa karegaa
 Earth becomes a villain in times of crisis
 ise saadhane ke liye majboot netaa kaa aahwan hone lagata he
 Many strong leaders came and went in the world but could not bring economic stability for a long time from the current economy
 aarthik oochaal ab bahut dinon tak nahin tikta
 Does not last in one country
 kya obama kamazor netaa hai
 The economy is not run by the fitness of leaders
 hillari clinton ne yah nahin kaha ki ve chaatro ke karj maaf karengi lekin yah sunishchit karengi ki chaatr jab kalege se paas karen to un par karj kaa boj na rahe
 Can it happen aap ganit main fail bhi hai to dimag lagaaiye
 If education becomes fully marketable, how will you and us be saved from the cost of expensive fees? jab america kaa amir samaaj nahin batch sakaa to bharat kaa garib samaaj kaise batch jayega
 With Ramdev's medicine or Hamdard's Unani medicines
 hillari clinton kah rahi he ki jumalebaazi yaa chamakdaar naaron se kahin zyada yojana banane kii jarurat he
 It requires experience
 dhyaan se dekhenge to unki ye baaten bhi jumale se kam nahin he
 Hillary Clinton has also said that she will use tax rules to monitor companies that send their work to outside countries
 jisase vahaan ke logon ko naukariyaan milti hai america ko nahin
 Every other big country in the global world is struggling with the question of jobs
 jo baat america main ho rahi he vahi baat britain main ho rahi he
 Britain's sluggish economy and unemployment is also a big reason for leaving the European Union
 britain ke nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke deshon ke naagarik unki naukariyaan kha ja rahe hai, britain main rahane vaale bharat, pakistan or bangladesh se gaye nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke kaaran unke logon ko naukariyaan nahin mil rahi hai
 One is not understanding the problem of economics, one is searching for medicines in the bureaucracy and one is searching for medicines to get out of the European Union
 16 may 2016 ko independent akhbaar ne ek lekh chapa tha
 Poverty in the UK increased between 2013 and 2016
 15
 6 percent to 16
 8 pratishat ho gai he
 Poverty is much higher in Britain than in European Union countries
 britain main uniwarsity se paas hone vaale chaatro par european union ke deshon ke chaatro kii tulana main bahut zyaada karz kaa boj he
 The average loan for each student in 2015 is 44,500 euros
 bhartiya rupee main iskaa anuwaad karenge to behosh hi ho jaaenge
 a student has a debt of forty-four lakh rupees when he passes the university
 newzealand, austrailia,america ke chaatro se bhi zyada karja britain ke chaatro kaa he
 This is the result of privatization of education
 sarkarein janata ke paise se hathiyaar kharidne bechney ke dhandhe main lagi hai or uskaa yuva karj kaa boj liye nikal rahaa he
 Inequality is increasing in Britain
 asantosh bad rahaa he
 Therefore, it would not be appropriate to look at this referendum with a view or a spectacle

 Why is the youth thinking so? mahilaayein kyon european sangh se nikalne kii baat kah rahi hai
 Britain may remain in the European Union with the difference of a few votes, but are the questions being raised that this referendum is giving an answer
 sankat he lekin is sankat ke bahaane kuch netaa aisi baaten kah rahe hai jinka samaadhaan se koi sambandh nahin
 Only the decision to leave the EU can soothe frustration or immediate anger, but no one has a blueprint of what the solution will be
 britain main amir hi amir hota he jaisaa bharat main hota he jaisaa america main ho rahaa he
 a report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has been published in the Independent newspaper, according to which a rich student is earning more money even if a student of a rich and simple background, from the same university, gets a degree from the same course

 The condition is that girls perform better from school to college, they are also earning less than boys

 The separatists there want Britain to decide to leave the Union

 yah janamat sangrah european sangh ko kya badal degaa yaa britain ne badal diya he, is par ham prime time main baat karenge
 There are many forms of British media too
 yah main isliye bataa rahaa hum taaki aap ek darshak or loktantr ke hissedaar ke rup main samaj saken ki media aapke loktantric charitra ko kaise badal rahaa he
 How is he covering you in the grooves of yes or no through his survey? loktantr main aap tay nahin kar rahe hai, media aapako tay kar rahaa he
 Is building you chunaav aate hi media aapako ek kritrim naagarik main badal rahaa he
 i do not know if you make a difference with these things or not
 to hazaraat opinian pole kii baadh ai hui he britain main
 In some, victory is out of the European Union, and in others there is victory
 donon ke bich maton kaa faasla bahut kam he
 Even the right-wing media is raising absurd nationalist questions, while the liberal media is not able to bring out the diversity of issues
 britain bechaini se guzar rahaa he
 Why this uneasiness grew so much that he had to move towards the referendum to break away from the European Union
 agar britain european sangh main bana rahata he to kya chhodane ke pakshadharon ke sawaal samaapt ho jaaenge
 what's the question
 isse pehle ek baat yah jaan lijie ki duniya main mandi chal rahi he
 The recession is also going on in Britain
 ye mandi berojgaare laati he or jivan kii gati ko dhimaa kar detii he
 The result is the logic of all of us, but the ways of reasoning change in such a fatal way that at times democracy itself is in danger
 america main aapane dekha hoga donald trump in bechainiyon ke bahaane kis tarah kii aakraamak baaten kar rahe hai
 They sometimes start saying that Muslims will not allow them to enter America, and sometimes they say that outsiders will not have rights over American jobs
 log yah bhi nahin dekh pate ki trump jaise netaa musalamaanon or gaiyr musmalanon ke liye ek hi baat kah rahe hai
 The New York Times reports that Hillary Clinton admits the US economy has fallen into disarray
 sirf ve hi logon kii hataasha ko apni nitiyon se badal sakati hai
 Hillary says that changing Washington's bureaucracy and corporate will not be easy but will try
 kya vaaki aaj kii duniya main koi netaa he jo karporate ko badal de
 If corporates are producing leaders, then who will produce them? arth sankat ke samay naukarshahi khalanaayak ban jaati he
 It takes a strong leader's call to practice it
 duniya main bahut se majboot netaa aae or gaye magar maujuuda arthniti se lambey samay tak ke liye aarthik sthayitv nahin laa sake
 The economic boom does not last long
 ek desh main nahin tikta he
 Is Obama a weak leader? arthvyavastha netaaon ke fitness se nahin chalati he
 Hillary Clinton did not say that she would forgive the students' debts but would ensure that when the students pass from the college, they are not burdened with debt
 kya aisa ho saktaa he
 If you fail in mathematics also, mind yourself
 agar shiksha puri tarah bazaaru ho jaaegi to mahangi fees kii maar se aap or ham kaise bachenge
 When the rich society of America could not survive, then how would the poor society of India survive
 ramdev kii aushadhi se yaa hamdard kii unani dawaaiyon se
 Hillary Clinton is saying that there is more need to plan than jumlebabies or shiny slogans
 iske liye anubhav kii zarurat he
 If we look carefully, these things of him are also not less than a word
 hillari clinton ne yah bhi kaha he ki ve tex niyamon kaa istemaal kar un companiyon par nigaah rakhengi jo apana kaam baahar ke deshon main bhej dete hai
 Which gives jobs to the people there, not American
 global jagat main har doosraa bada desh naukariyon ke sawaal se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 The same thing that is happening in America is happening in Britain
 european sangh se nikalne ke peeche britain kii sust arthvyavastha or berojgaare bhi bada kaaran he
 British citizens feel that citizens of European Union countries are losing their jobs, citizens from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh living in Britain feel that their people are not getting jobs due to European Union
 koi arthniti ke khot ko nahin samaj rahaa koi naukarshahi main dawa khoj rahaa he to koi european union se nikalne main dawa khoj rahaa he
 An article was published by the Independent newspaper on 16 May 2016

 15
 6 pratishat se badhkar 16
 8 percent
 european union ke deshon kii tulana main britain main garibi bahut zyada he
 Students passing university in the UK have a higher debt burden than students in European Union countries
 2015 main har chaatr par ausat karza 44,500 euro he
 If you translate it into Indian rupees, then you will faint
 ek chaatr par chauwalis lakh rupee kaa karz hota he jab wo uniwarsity se paas karata he
 UK students have more loans than students in New Zealand, Australia, USA
 ye he shiksha ke nijeekaran kaa nateeja
 Governments are engaged in the business of buying and selling weapons with the money of the public and its youth are running out of debt
 britain main asamanta bad rahi he
 There is growing discontent
 isliye is janamat sangrah ko ek najariye yaa ek chashme se dekhnaa thik nahin rahegaa
 We have to see what the working class is thinking
 yuva kyon aisa soch rahaa he
 Why are women asking to leave the European Union? kuch voton ke antar se bhale britain european sangh main rah jaae magar jo sawaal uth rahe hai kya unka jawaab ye janamat sangrah de rahaa he
 There is a crisis, but on the pretext of this crisis, some leaders are saying such things which have no relation with the solution
 sirf iyu se nikal jane kaa faisla hataasha yaa tatkaal gusse ko shant kar saktaa he magar samaadhaan kya hoga iskaa koi blueprint kisi ke paas nahin he

 Compared to ordinary students
 haalat yah he ki ladkiyaan skool se lekar kalege main behatar pradarshan karti hai wo bhi ladakon kii tulana main kam kama rahi hoti hai
 Why do we not investigate these reasons in times like referendum

 tippaniyan The European Union may solve practical difficulties of doing business, but does it represent democratic aspirations

 europe ke bheetar algaavvaadi andolan is janamat sangrah ko alag tareeke se dekh rahe hai

 vahaan ke algaavvaadi chaahate hai ki britain sangh se nikalne kaa faisla kare
 Spain is threatening that if Britain comes out then it will have a negative impact on citizens who are working in different countries of the European Union
 ek dilachasp abhyaas to he hi ye janamat sangrah
 In a country like India, questions of nationalism and sovereignty are being decided by protest demonstrations by two or four organizations
 britain main karodon log matdaan ke zariye is sawaal kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 People of India who dream of going to London, to settle down and do jobs, have already settled many lakhs of people
 unke liye janamat sangrah kya myne rakhata he
 We will talk in prime time on whether this referendum will change the European Union or what Britain has changed
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aapako in baton se fark bhi padataa he yaa nahin

 There is growing discontent

 The separatist movements within Europe are viewing this referendum differently
 jaise kaatalonia spain se alag hona chahta he
 The separatists there want Britain to decide to leave the Union
 spain dhamkee de rahaa he ki agar britain niklaa to uske nagarikon par nakaaratmak asar padegaa jo european union ke alag alag deshon main kaam kar rahe hai
