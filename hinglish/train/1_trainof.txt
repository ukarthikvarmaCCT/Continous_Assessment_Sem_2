 Some journalists are also retweeting this tweet
 darasal teen farvari ko unhone ek twit ke jawaab main kaha tha- ek baar jab aap bhaajapa main shaamil ho jate hai to aapke saare aparaadh saaf ho jate hai
 Now look at the coincidence, a month later he himself joined BJP

 Responding to this tweet, another journalist said- that is why he defended BJP
 twit or retweet ke is silsile ko aage badhaate hue tom vadakkan(tab congress netaa) ne twit karte hue kaha-ek baar jab aap bhaajapa main shaamil ho jate hai to aapke saare aparaadh saaf ho jate hai
 Now people are making this alleged old tweet viral

 Let me tell you that Tom Vadakkan ((tom Vadakkan)) is considered very close to Sonia Gandhi

 Instant messaging app whatsapp is undergoing major changes
 agast main hamane aapako bataaya tha ki company ne google ke saath partnership kii he
 Under this, chat backup of whatsapp in Google Drive will be given by default
 company ne yah bhi kaha he ki agar 12 november tak yugers ne apane watsap chats byaap ko google drive par rifresh nahin kiya he to unki chat history delit kii ja sakati he
 However, this is not a serious problem, because if you always take backup or chats are in your smartphone then they will not be deleted
 google ke saath kii gai partnership ke tahat google drive par watsap chats kaa byaap rakhane se aapako die gaye spes main koi kami nahin aegi
 The advantage of having Google Drive parvotsapps Backup is that you can open it easily on any smartphone
 agar aapane nayaa phone liya he yaa phir watsap ke liye nae smartphone ko yuj kar rahe hai aise main ye feechar aapke liye phydemand sabit hoga
 To backup whatsapp on Google Drive, activate your smartphone Google Drive
 byaap banane ke liye watsap ke main menu main ja kar settings par tap karen
 There will be a chat option here, you can select Backup to Google Drive
 yahaan byaap frequency kaa opshan milegaa jise apane hisaab se chun len
 Enter the account where you want to save your chats backup
 company ke yugers ko byaap lete samay phone ko wifai se conect karne kii salaah di he, kyonki byaap files sies main alag hoti hai or data khapat karte hai jisase aapako extra data ke paise lag sakate hai
 Significantly, Kivots Appchat backup system is different from other chatting apps
 kyonki watsap ke chats or media kisi daticated sarvice main store hone ke bajaae phone main hi store hote hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to backup whatsapp's data while changing the phone, so users have to resort to Google Cloud
 haalanki yphone main watsap kaa data icloud par byaap hota he, lekin aam taur par logon kaa free kota jald hi khatm hota he

 unhone kaha, "logon kii ummiden hamaari ummiden hai
 People of Gujarat currently expect the Congress to form the government
 " Pathak claimed that all-round development in every corner of the state would strengthen the bjp's prospects

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main aaj subah hui kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak main yah mahatvapurn faisla karte hue rupaye ke chinh ko manjuuri di gayi
 After the meeting, Information Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni told reporters here that after incorporating this symbol in the 'unicode Standard, ISO-IEC 10646 and IS 13194', it can be used within and outside India
 unhone kaha, ‘‘rupee kaa chinh bhartiya mudra kii pahchaan kaayam karegaa or bhartiya arthvyavastha kii teji evam majbootee ko rekhaankit karegaa

 The process of encoding the rupee mark in Indian standards will take six months, while Unicode and other standards will take one and a half to two years to do so
 unhone kaha ki yah chinh bhartiya rupaye ko vibhinn bhashaaon main ek hi tarah se pesh karne main sahaayak hoga
 This will make the Indian rupee different from the currencies of countries like Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, where the rupee or rupee is used
 ambika ne kaha ki is chinh ko ‘unicode maanak’ main shaamil kiya jayega taaki duniya kii sabhi lipiyon main ise likhaa ja sake
 This symbol can be printed in electronic and print media as all software companies will develop software in accordance with this standard
 chinh ko bhartiya maanakon main bhi shaamil kiya jayega
 For this, the existing list of Bureau of Indian Standards will be amended

 Neither the neighbors nor the cleric
 main jitna sanskrit jaanata hum, utana to quran kaa bhi gyaan mujhe nahin he
 Many Hindus in my area have cheered me on my Sanskrit knowledge
 BHU main akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad se jude chaatr andolan kar rahe hai
 In a conversation with the media, the students said that no person who is not attached to the basis of their language and religion can teach us how
 firoz khan ne is pratikriya dete hue kaha ki jo log kah rahe hai ki main muslim hote hue unhen dharm kii shiksha kaise de saktaa hum
 On this, i say that Literature has to study the technical aspects of Sanskrit literature and many famous dramas such as the epics like Abhigyan Shakuntalam, Uttar Ramcharitam, Raghuvansha epic and Harshacharitam
 inkaa dharm se koi lenadena nahin he
 Feroze said that once i can believe that if i had to teach Vedas, Dharma Shastra or Astrology, it would have been better if i was Hindu
 lekin meri niyukti sanskrit sahitya padhaane ke liye hui he, jiskaa dharm se koi lenadena nahin he
 i just want to teach what has already been written
 vahiin duusari ore firoz khan ke pita ramajaan khan bhi sanskrit main shastri degree le chuke he
 He said that i fell in love with Sanskrit throughout my life and got my son also trained in Sanskrit from the second grade
 lekin ab dil kachot rahaa he ki is mukaam par pahunchakar bhi kuch logon ke virodh ke chalate unke bete kaa kariyar daanv par laga he
 Seeing the opposition that is happening in BHU due to my son's appointment, i think it would have been more right if he had a chicken shop opened instead of teaching him Sanskrit
 tab logon ko itani aapatti nahin hoti
 The Deputy Chief Minister said, "akhilesh ran the government for five years, but what example did he set

 It was organized by Bengaluru-based Project Vision, under which blind walks were organized to spread awareness about eye donation in 250 cities across the country and the world
 ankhon par pattee baandhakar chalane kaa matlab bilkul saaf tha ki aap kuch der ke liye hi sahi is baat ko mahasoos kar sake ki jo log netraheen hai unki duniya kisi he
 Actually 20 percent of the world's blind people live in India and their number is 1
5 crore
 kisi na kisi vajah se desh main har saal 2 xxrep 5 0 log or apane ankhon kii roshni ganvaa dete hai
 But in India only 25,000 people donate eye every year
 jabaki desh main har saal 85,00,000 logon kii maut ho jaati he
 If half of these people can also donate their eyes, then many blind people in the country can get eyes and light in their dark world
 blind walk kaa makasad tha logon main iske bare main jaagarukta failaana or unhen yah bataanaa kii maut ke baad zyaadaatar logon kii ankhen is kaabil hoti hai ki vah kisi kii duniya roshan kar sakati hai
 People who wear glasses or people who have blood pressure or diabetes such a disease also have eyes that can be useful to any blind
 netradaan karne ke liye bas kisi kii mrityu ke baad unke parivaar waalon ko najdiki ai bank ko sampark karnaa padataa he or ek chote se oparation ke baad netra daan kiya ja saktaa he

 blind walk maukey par paryaton mantri alphons kannathanam ne kaha ki srilanka ek chota sa desh he, lekin vahaan par kanoonee rup se sabake liye jaruri he ki vah maut ke baad netradaan karen
 Because of this Sri Lanka also exports eyes to other countries
 unhone maang kii ki bharat main bhi aisa hi kanoon banaaya janaa chahie

 ) Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday questioned the Delhi Chief Minister's commitment to fight corruption after Arvind Kejriwal criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi while sharing the stage with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 prasad ne kaha ki pradhanmantri dwaara sava lakh karod rupee kaa vishesh package dene ke baavjood nitish kaa bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kaa raag alaapna raajnneeti ke alaava or kuch nahin he
 He also denied Nitish's charge that in view of the assembly elections, this package has been announced for political gains
 unhone daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne kisi raajnneeti ke tahat yah ghoshnaa nahin kii he balki pradhanmantri kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad se hi vah bihar or saare purvi bharat ke vikaas par dhyaan de rahe hai
 Taking a sarcasm at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Prasad said, "all Bihari are happy with the announcement of the package of Rs 1
25 lakh crore
 keval teen logon ko chhodkar
 These three people are - Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Rahul Gandhi
 ’’ Prasad said, "it is a matter of great regret that the Chief Minister of Bihar did not even say a word of thanks to the Prime Minister for such a big and historic package
" ’’ unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘‘nitish kumaar ko bihar ke vikaas kii chintaa nahin he
 It is clear from the comments he is making about the announcement of such a huge package by the Prime Minister
 isse saaf he ki bihar ke liye vishesh package kii unki maang mahaj raajnneeti he
 '' nitish ke saath manch saajha karne or pradhanmantri kii aalochana karne ke liye unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi aade haath lete hue kaha, ‘‘dilli ke mukhyamantri apane aap ko bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yoddha bataate hai
 But did he forget who has an alliance with Bihar? lalu prasad nitish ke saath hai or sonia gandhi tathaa rahul gandhi lalu ke saath hai
 Sonia and Rahul are silent on 2-G
 tippaniyan The BJP leader said, "I am happy that Kejriwal will go to Bihar
 ham bhi sunenge ki nitish, lalu, sonia or rahul ke gathbandhan par unke kya vichaar hai
 Kejriwal, while sharing the stage with Nitish on 'bihar Day' here yesterday, strongly advocated another term for the Chief Minister of Bihar
 donon ne pradhanmantri par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kiye gaye vaayadon ko puraa nahin kiya he
 Both had said that they would fight together to give full state status to Delhi and special state status to Bihar
 bihar aane ke nitish ke nimantran ko bhi kejariwal ne sweekaar kiya
 Prasad said that despite the Prime Minister giving a special package of Rs 1
25 lakh crore, the statement of Nitish giving special status to Bihar is nothing but politics
 unhone nitish ke is aarope se bhi inkaar kiya ki vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue raajnneetik laabh ke liye is package kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 He claimed that the Prime Minister has not made this announcement under any politics, but since taking over as Prime Minister, he has been focusing on the development of Bihar and all eastern India
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par kataaksh karte hue prasad ne kaha, ‘‘sava lakh karod rupayon ke package kii ghoshnaa se sabhi bihari khush hai
 Except for only three people
 ye teen log hai - nitish kumaar, lalu prasad or rahul gandhi
 '' prasad ne kaha, ‘‘yah bahut khed kii baat he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ne itane bade or aitihaasik package ke liye pradhanmantri ko dhanyavad kaa ek shabd tak nahin kaha
 "he alleged," Nitish Kumar is not worried about the development of Bihar
 pradhanmantri dwaara itane bade package kii ghoshnaa ko lekar vah jo tippaniyan kar rahe hai, usase yah saaf vidit he
 It is clear that his demand for a special package for Bihar is just politics
 ’’ He also lashed out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for sharing the stage with Nitish and criticizing the Prime Minister, saying, "the Chief Minister of Delhi calls himself a warrior against corruption
" lekin kya vah yah bhul gaye ki bihar main kiskaa gathbandhan he
 Lalu Prasad is with Nitish and Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are with Lalu
 sonia or rahul 2-ji par khamosh hai
 The comments bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe khushi he ki kejariwal ji bihar jaaenge
 We will also hear what his views are on the alliance of Nitish, Lalu, Sonia and Rahul
 ’’ kejariwal ne kal yahaan ‘bihar diwas’ par nitish ke saath manch saajha karte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri ke liye ek or kaarykaal kii joardaar vakaalat kii thi
 Both had accused the Prime Minister of not fulfilling the promises made in the Lok Sabha elections
 donon ne kaha tha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene or bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye ve mil kar sangharsh karenge
 Kejriwal also accepted Nitish's invitation to come to Bihar
 unhone daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne kisi raajnneeti ke tahat yah ghoshnaa nahin kii he balki pradhanmantri kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad se hi vah bihar or saare purvi bharat ke vikaas par dhyaan de rahe hai

 Now the message of 'I love you' is sent very easily through the sound of beep-beep on mobile, messaging apps like whatsapp, Viber, Hike are ready to make it feel more happy

 Sometimes rose petals within the letters, sometimes spray of tuberose, sometimes heart shaped with pink color

 Songs like ‘likhe jo khat tujhe’, ‘I wrote the name of Khat Mehboob’, ‘pyaar ke paper pe, dil ki pen se’ still add to the heartbeat of young hearts

 Team India's captain Cool MS Dhoni has said goodbye to Test cricket and Virat Kohli will replace him as the new captain
 viraat kohli edilade test ke jariye pehle hi apni captaini se sabko prabhavit kar chuke hai, lekin abhi unhen kaaphi kuch siikhnaa he
 It was under Dhoni's captaincy that Team India became the best team in Tests for the first time
 unhone team ko jahaan kuch yaadgaar jeet dilaain to vahiin unki aguwai main team kuch sharmnaak haar bhi jhelni padi
 Now Virat is going to take command of the team in his place
 test cricket main mahendra singh dhoni ke 20 khaas recordpanch aisi baaten jo viraat ko dhoni se seekhney kii jarurat haih1- kool tempramentsdhoni ko captain kool aise hi nahin kaha jaataa
 Whatever be the situation in the match, Dhoni remains very cool
 kitna bhi pressure ho dhoni ke chehre par shikan nahin aati he
 Win, lose or draw a match, there is not much difference in their facial expressions
 is maamle main viraat kohli unase seekhney kii jarurat he ki paristhiti kisi bhi ho temprament kool hona chahie bilkul hamaare captain kool kii tarah
 2- Don't be afraid of experiment: Dhoni has been a captain who never shied away from experimenting
 kai baar experiment safal hue to kai baar uskaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padaa lekin dhoni experiment karne se peeche nahin hatate the
 Be it a change in bowling, field placement or a change in batting order, Dhoni is never afraid of experiment
 yah clality unhen baaki captainon se alag karti he
 So if you too have to take over the reins of the team for a long time, do not back out of the experiment
 3- saathi khilaadiyon ke liye bane misalehmahi ke naam se mashhoor dhoni on field hon yaa of field saathi khilaadiyon kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya he
 Dhoni has never responded to sledging, but with his bat
 yah viraat ke liye bahut ahm sabak hoga
 Dhoni himself has been an aggressive captain but has been avoiding extreme aggression
 viraat kohli ke atitude main ati aakraamakata saaf dikhaai detii he
 The captain is like a mirror to the rest of the team and his conduct is similar to that of fellow players
 aakraamakata buree baat nahin he lekin viraat ko ati aakraamakata se bachanaa hoga, yah team india ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 4- Don't hesitate to consult anyone: Dhoni's captaincy has been the USP that he never hesitated to consult any player
 sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid, saurav ganguli or anil kumble jaise senior khilaadi hon yaa dhoni se junior khilaadi unhone jarurat padane par har kisi kii salaah lee
 Virat Kohli will also have to keep doing this to become a successful captain
 5- team ke liye stand lenaviraat kohli kaa kharaab form ho, yaa england main jadeja-anderson vivaad jab bhi khilaadiyon ko captain kool ke saport kii jarurat hui dhoni ne unhen niraash nahin kiya
 While talking in the media, Dhoni has always been careful what he has to say and what not
 viraat ko yah ahm sikh dhoni se leni hogi
 Apart from this, Dhoni has never been seen to make unnecessary excuse for defeat, he speaks very clear cut
 koi gendbaaj agar kuch gend kharaab phenk de to dhoni uske paas jaakar uskaa utsaah badhaate the or yah bahut badi cheez hoti he
 Dhoni has always trusted fellow players
 dhoni ne bhi shaayad isiilie sanyas kaa faisla liya he kyonki unhen lagane laga he ki viraat is jimmedaari ke liye taiyaar ho chuke hai
 In the journalist Gauri Lankesh murder case, now the police is investigating whether the Naxalites are behind the murder of Gauri
 darasal, gauri lankesh chori chhipe kai baar bastar ke jangalo main daakhil hui thim
 His brother Indrajit Lankesh had also claimed that Gauri had received threats from Naxalite organizations
 gauri kukhyat naksaliyon ko mukhyadhara laana chaahati thim
 This is the reason that the Chhattisgarh police has also become active on this matter
 gauri ke bhai indrajit lankesh ke mutabikgauri lankeshko naksaliyon kii taraf se dhamkee bhare patr or i-mail bhi aae the
 That is why the Chhattisgarh police is looking for a Naxal connection in connection with the murder of Gauri
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki varsh 2015 or 2016 main chaar se adhik baar gauri lankesh bastar ke jangalo main gai thim
 However, police are collecting authorized information about when and with whom they met in the forest
 adivaasiyon par hone vaale atyaachaar or maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan ko lekar gauri lankesh ne bastar kaa daura kiya tha
 But it is also said that Gauri Lankesh had especially entered the forests of Bastar to meet the active Naxalites of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 unhone har daure main teen se chaar din tak jangal main bitaye the
 However, Gauri Lankesh kept distance from local police and social workers after meeting with the Naxalites
 unhone aisa kyon kiya tha isaki vajah bhi talash kii ja rahi he
 According to Bastar Superintendent of Police Arif Sheikh, no information was received about Gauri Lankesh's visit in the last 6 months
 haalanki ve iske pehle yadi ai hongi to isaki chaanbin hogi
 Arif Sheikh admitted that the police had received information about the Gauri Lankesh Kenksley connection through the media
 jisaki tasdik karai ja rahi he
 It is reported that the Central Committee had also discussed several times with Gauri Lankesh on the surrender of many notorious Naxalites
 sheersh naksali netaaon ko andeshaa tha ki gauri lankesh cader besd naksaliyon ko aatmasamarpan ke liye na keval uksaati thi balki police or unke bich aatmasamarpan ko lekar maahaul taiyaar karti thim
 According to experts, after the creation of Telangana state, the Central Committee of Naxalites was angry with Gauri Lankesh for the surrender of more than half a dozen notorious Naxals
 chhattisgarh ke patrakaron ko bhi andeshaa he ki naksaliyon kii small ection team ne to kahin is ghatana ko anjaam nahin diya
 At present, the investigation of the case is going on fast

 The Delhi High Court has banned the sale of medicines sold online
 dilli hai court ne ek yachika par sunwaayee karte hue aadesh diya he ki dilli sarkaar board dwaara lagaae ja rahe bain ko sakhti se lagu karen
 Hearing a petition filed on behalf of dermatologist Zaheer Ahmed, Hahai Court said that the health of people cannot be played with and it needs to be checked immediately
 darasal, yachikakarta ne hai court ko bataaya ki har roj lakhon kii taadaad menonlinevaayiyon ko bechaa ja rahaa he or niyamon ko taak par rakhkar aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 Online medicines are being sold without a prescription
 yahaan tak kii logon ke i-mail par bhi dawaaiyon ko ghar par bheja ja rahaa he
 This order made by the Delhi High Court will be applied to medicines sold online across the country
 yachikakarta kii taraf se aisi darjanabhar badi websites kii jaankaree court ko di gai jin par niyamon kaa ulanghan karke online dawaai bechney kaa aarope he
 The petitioner said that drugs cannot be sold online even under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940 and Pharmacy Act 1948
 yachika main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki kuch websites pratibandhit dawaaon kii bhi supplai logon tak bhejti hai
 To stop the sale of medicines online, the South Delhi Chemists Association has also approached the High Court earlier
 us yachika main bhi online bik rahi dawaaiyon or bina doctor kii salaah ke logon dwaara kharidi ja rahi dawaaiyon ko turant rokane kii court se guhaar lagaai gai thi
 There is a huge business of online sale of medicines in metro cities
 sach yah bhi he ki online bik rahi in dawaaiyon par sarkaar kaa ankush naa ke baraabar he
 This is the reason that it is becoming common for drugstores to be sold online often
 aise main ab hoicourt ne online dawaaiyon kii bikri par roak to laga di he, lekin is par puri tarah se roak tabhi lag paaegi jab dilli sarkaar isko sakhti se lagu kar paae
 In another judgment, the Delhi High Court has slammed the Delhi government for denying a woman a job after becoming a mother, in another judgment
 court ne isliye fatkaar lagaai kyonki dilli sarkaar ne ek mahila ko uski naukari par baad main vichaar karne ke liye kaha kyonki us mahila ne kuch hi dinon pehle ek navjaat shishu ko janm diya tha or philhal kaam karne main asamarth thi
 The Delhi High Court, in its order commenting, said that women's self-respect and dignity should be taken care of at the workplace and the government should have sympathy for pregnant women working
 itnaa hi nahi hai court ne dilli sarkaar ko aadesh dete hue kaha he ki jald hi is mahila kii niyukti par vichaar kar court main apni report bhi daayar kare
 Actually, the selection of the woman was done in the guest teacher of Delhi government some time ago
 salection ke baad jab wo jwine karne gai to us vakt usne navjaat shishu ko kuch din pehle hi janm diya tha, lekin uski sthiti dekhakar dilli sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki uske bare main baad main vichaar kiya jayega
 The woman said in her plea that the attitude of the officers was harassing her
 pichley saal uskaa guest teacher ke liye salection hua tha or isi saal janvari main surgery ke jariye uski delivery hui
 On 1 February, she was asked to join, but when she arrived with all her documents to join, she was shown absconding and asked to come later
 hai court ke aadesh ke baad ab do hafton mendillisarkaar ko apni states report deni he or court ke nirdesh ke anusaar mahila kii fitness ke hisaab se skool main use kaam diya janaa he

 Mamta Banerjee did not breathe until the Tata Nano company was moved out of West Bengal and the land was returned to the farmers

 But this issue stood up to the sentiments of the farmers and Mamata Banerjee emerged as a farmer and poor supporter
 ye baat alag he ki baad main unhone fikki jaisi audyogic sanstha ke tatkaaleen mahasachiv amit mitra ko apana vitt mantri banaaya
 But the common man who is drifting in spirit does not have time to understand these nuances

 This conversation takes time, but this time also serves to cool the anger

 In such a situation, the nature of arbitrariness in the acquiring agencies is certain to increase
 yamuna express ve ke maamle main hi zyaadaatar jameen immergency praavdhaan ke jariye hasil kii gai thi, jabaki immergency jaisi koi baat kahin thi hi nahin
 On this basis, the Allahabad High Court canceled the acquisitions one after the other
 duusari baat yah thi ki in adhigrahan kaa yamuna express ve kii mukhya sadak se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 The government needs to be more transparent in the manner in which there is a competition in the country about land and water among the growing population
 jameen adhigrahan ordinance kaa pehla pareekshan tabhi hoga jab koi nayaa or bada jameen adhigrahan sarkaar karegi
 The government will have to accept at least this much that it will not be easy to take the Tatas from Bengal to Gujarat and give them the land of the Agricultural University

 piem modi ne kaha, 'puraani sarkaron kaa swabhaav latakaana, atakana or bhatakana tha
 Projects worth about 10 lakh crores were hanging, stuck, lost
 unako hamane karyanvit kiya, dhan kaa prabandh kiya or aaj tej gati se wo kaam aage chal rahe hai
 One of the same is the work of Navi Mumbai Airport
 '18 se 20 farvari tak sumitmaharashtra sarkaar ne 18 se 20 farvari tak chalane vaale magnetic maharashtra kanvargence 2018 ke madhyam se 10 lakh karod rupee ke nivesh kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 There are likely to be 4,500 agreements during this conference
 kaha ja rahaa he is qaraar se rajya main takreeban 35 lakh nae rojgaar paidaa honge
 Focus on employment So far, the entire focus of Maharashtra government has been on attracting only and only investment, but this time the state government will insist on such investment so that more and more employment opportunities can be created
 16700 karod kaa airportbatate chalem ki 16700 karod rupee kii laagat se navi mumbai airport taiyaar hoga
 This airport was being dreamed for 21 years
 mumbai kii badhati jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye 1997 main 3000 karod rupee se ek anya hawaii adde kii yojana bani thi, lekin raajnneetik anirnay kii sthiti, paryaavaran anaapattiyon or funding ke muddon samet kai kaarnon se is pariyojna main deree hui
 The 2,268 hectares of land required for this airport have not yet been fully acquired
 iske ban jane se mumbai ke chhatrapati shivaji antarrashtriya hawaii adde par dabaav kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Jungle, the jungle of central India, was the sea of learning and its devil fish
 pita vakil the, magar vidya banjaaron sa jab tab in jangalon main bhatakta rahata tha
 Then when he did his BA from Morris College, Nagpur in 1951, life's questions brought him here
 jangal main jawaab mila vidya ko
 Congress leader Vidyacharan Shukla died, injured in Maoist attack, he started a company
 uskaa naam tha elvin kupar privet li
 This company used to organize jungle safaris in the decade after independence
 jab jangal kaa shor, khauf or badppan lekar log safari se lautate, to vidya ko lagata ki uske khajaane kii saakhi main ek or shaks kaa ijapha ho gaya
 But life itself could not wander in the forest
 iskaa ilham unhen bhi tha
 After all, father Ravi Shankar Shukla made him his orderly Joe
 shukla central provins ke sabase kaddavar netaa the
 Was a lawyer
 jab ve samvidhan sabha kii baithkon main jate, to vidya kaa kaam hota, unki filein sametanaa
 Keep details of those who meet them
 apane khanij or jangal safari kaa kaarobaar jamaane ke baad vidya phir laute raajnneeti ke jangal main
 This time he was not an intern, but was preparing for entry
 pita ravishankar 1956 main madhyapradesh ke siem ke taur par apni aakhri badi pari khel chuke the
 Kailash Nath Katju's dominance in the state had increased
 magar vidya paariwarik viraasat ke dam par mahasamund seat se tikat le aae
 If won, he became a Lok Sabha MP in 1957 at the age of just 28
 silsilaa shuru ho chukaa tha, dilli kii siyasat kaa
 In those days, Indira Gandhi too was eager to become the heir to her political will by increasing the scope of her father's control
 1959 main indira pehali martabaa congress kii adhyaksh baniin
 Prakash Kushal Vidya soon joined Indira's favorite list
 jab shastri ke baad indira piem baniin, to shukla bhi mantrimandal main shaamil hue
 The elder brother also got the nearest sila from the younger brother's supremo
 vidya ke bade bhai shyama charan shukla 1969 main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane
 The journey of Vidya Charan Shukla was going well so far
 magar usamen kuch aisa nahin tha, jo taarikh main na mitane vaali lakeer sa madda rakhata ho
 Then came the era of emergency
 indira thim, magar hone se zyada nepathy main chali gai thim
 Sanjay, with thick cuttings, thick glasses and a sharp Kashmiri nose, had made his debut on stage
 usee teji se, jis teji se ve maaruti chalaane kaa hawa hawaii daawa karte the
 In the early days of Emergency, Sanjay Kotri's attention went to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 ye sanjay ke mizaaj ke mutabik nahin chal rahaa tha
 When the news of opposition was also coming on this
 usase bhi bhayanak aparaadh yah tha ki yah mantralay apni naak ke neeche chap rahe akhabaaron ko, unki khabaron ko niyantrit nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 In such an evening, Sanjay took a break from Indira and went to Parvana
 us samay ke mantri inder kumaar gujral ko rajdoot banaakar rus ravaanaa kar diya gaya
 And Vidyacharan Shukla got the responsibility of IB Ministry
 us din ke baad vidya ne apni nishtha dikhaane kaa koi mauka jaaya nahin kiya
 Every newspaper used to visit his office before publication and used to come back after coloring in black circles
 haalat ye ho gai thi ki sampadakon ne khijhakar sampadakeey kii jagah khaali chhodani shuru kar di
 After this, Vidya also stopped this practice
 varisht patrkaar vinod mehta ne apni kitaab da sanjay story main iskaa zikr kiya he
 According to him, Vidya had become the biggest editor and one-man censor board
 isi vakt amrit nahata kii film ‘kissa kursi kaa’ na sirf relies hone se roak di gai thi balki iske saare print bhi nasht karvaa die gaye the
 Later in 1977, the film was released again after the Janata Party came to power
 doordarshan kaa ye haal tha ki har jagah uskaa puraa kaa puraa staff sanjay gandhi ke dauron ko cover karne main vyast rahata tha
 Every other program on TV, a twenty-point program, was focused on family planning and the removal of encroachments
 masalaa yaheen nahin rukta
 The fear of Vidya went beyond the editors of Delhi and started to mourn in Mumbai too
 rajnatik galiyaaron main ye mashhoor kissa he ki vidya ne apane grih rajya madhya pradesh ke rahane vaale singer kishor kumaar se kaha ki ve sanjay gandhi kii sabha main aakar gaayen
 The teenager of Fakkad mood refused
 natijatan, agle do baras tak kishor kii aawaaj radio se gul ho gai
 Another book is very famous in the corridors of Delhi
 iske mutabik vidya ke kaam se indira gandhi itani khush thim, ki jab dilli main 1982 main trade fere ke liye maidan or pavilion banakar taiyaar hue, to unhone iskaa naam vidya kii badi beti ke naam par pragati rakh diya
 Today, Pragati Maidan is a major landmark of Delhi, but no one knows the truth of this anecdote
 maidan kaa namakaran to ho gaya, magar safadarajang hawaii adde par kalabaziyon ke shikaar bane sanjay ke baad vidya kaa sitara bhi kamjor padane laga tha
 As soon as Rajiv Gandhi came to power, the Baba people of the Doon School were playing checkmate on the chess of politics
 inke bich puraane abhijatya vidya jam nahin paae
 When VP Singh came out of the Congress in protest against Mr
 Clean Rajiv Gandhi, he also left Vidya from behind
 vidya charan shukla ne hawa kaa rukh bhaanp liya tha
 He was one of the few leaders who, by forming a Jan Morcha, sided with Raja Manda VP Singh and raised him so high that he could appear against Rajiv
 un dinon kaa ek kissa bayaan karte hai varisht patrkaar ram bahadur raay
 The opinion was an opportunity for the Janam Morcha leaders to visit Chennai
 ambassador car main sab savaar the
 Vidyacharan Shukla next to the driver
 peeche veepi singh or khud raay
 The journalist asked VP Singh that these visits and rallies were fine, but when would the party be formed
 veepi kuch bolte, usase pehle vidya kaa jawaab aayaa
 Now it will take at least ten more months
 ye ek jawaab bahut sawaal chup karaata tha
 First, even though the face in the front was Singh, the backroom stratidy was being made under the direction of Vidya
 doosraa, vidya ko ye pataa tha ki chunaav ladane ke liye sirf hawa nahin, us par sawari karne kaa khatola yani dal bhi chahie
 On 11 October 1988, the Janata Dal formed a total of ten months after this incident
 phir 89 main naaraa gunja, raja nahin fakir he, desh kii takadir he
 The fate changed quickly, the National Front and the Left Front formed the government
 bijepi ne baahar se samarthan diya or vidaya charan shukla kii cabinet main vaapasi hui
 Meanwhile, Rai narrates another anecdote
 hua yun ki indira ke samay se hi vidya ko raashtrapati bhawan ke peeche sthit president estate main bangala mila hua tha
 The largest and grand bungalow
 ek din yahaan jan morcha kii baithak hui
 Khanty leader of Haryana Devi Lal was also present in this
 jab veepi sarkaar bani, to taaoo devi laal up pradhanmantri bane
 He told Vidya that i like your house very much
 vidya ne ishaara bhaanp liya or bangala khaali kar diya taaoo ke liye
 Rai said, Vidya was tactful and knew that such gestures are very useful in politics
 ek dedh saal main hi raajnneeti kii hawa phir badali or vidya ne ise phir samay rahete bhaanp liya
 a section of the Janata Dal was broken under the leadership of the President, that is, Chandrasekhar and Vidya joined him
 saath diya tha to mantri pad milanaa hi tha
 In 1991, the National Front had disintegrated towards Pandit's clan
 kuch hi barason main vidya congress main laut aae or jald hi narsimha raav ke khaas ban gaye
 Entry in cabinet again
 magar raav raaj jane ke baad unke sitare bhi ruuthane lage
 Kesari Fakat was the treasurer and used to sit in the back chair, when Vidya constantly saw power happiness
 aise main kesari adhyaksh bane, to vidya kinare kar die gaye
 The coup d'état and Sonia came in his place
 lekin vidya alaakaman kii kichen cabinet main waapas nahin aa paae
 Chhattisgarh was carved out of the tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh in 2000
 vidya kii paaramparik seat mahasamund isi main aati thi
 The Congress was in majority in the legislative party of the separated state
 aise main siem bhi usee kaa bananaa tha
 Vidya felt that her turn had come
 magar taj sajaa beurocret se netaa bane ajit jogi ke sir
 This Jogi was once the Collector of Raipur and used to do Shuskal ji Sir Sir Yes Yes
 magar raajnneeti ateet ko aksar munh chidhaati he
 This coronation passed on to Vidya, he swore that the Congress had to dig its roots in the state
 2003 main chunaav hue
 Vidya had left the Congress by then
 unhone sharad pavaar kii ensipi jwine kar lee thi
 The survey of the same party was the survey in the state
 unhone har jagah congress candidet ko dhyaan main rakhkar tikat baante
 When the result came, Shukla got only one seat, but he gave a lot of anger to the Congress
 darasal ensipi candidats ke chalate congress 90 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main 28 siton par haar gai
 Smiling Vidya had then said that politics does not work with the pen of the Collector
 ishaara saaf tha
 But after this Shukla started going slowly to the margins
 ensipi kaa dhaancha khadaa karne ke liye jis urja kii jarurat thi, wo umr ke chalate unke ante main bachi nahin thi
 After a few years when Vajpayee's government went, it was decided that Vidya had no choice but to return to the Congress
 lekin aisi kisi bhi koshish kaa ajit jogi ne bharsak virodh kiya
 Still Vidya returned to the party
 laute, lekin karne ko kuch tha nahin
 In such a situation, he opted out of seclusion
 south dilli ke flats main rahete the
 Sometimes used to go to Raipur
 idhar chunaavon kii sugabugahat shuru hui, to chhattisgarh ke kai congressi chatrapon ne unka aashirwad auki saath maanga
 Vidya was waiting for any such Sanjeevani to become active
 vah umr ko jhuthalaakar phir se sakriy ho gaye
 During the change journey, his enthusiasm was visible
 phir aayaa 25 may kaa din
 It was the same forest, and the same ride gave the feeling of a safari
 lekin samay beraham ho chukaa tha
 The explosion occurred, the bullets went off and the three got stuck in Vidya's body
 unhone tab bhi dhairya nahin khoyaa
 When the journalists arrived on the spot, the blood-stained, litterateur on the ground said in a way of instructing them, pick me up and sit
 shukla kii tabiyat lagaataar bigadi
 His bullets were fired at the hospital in Jagdalpur
 phir raipur main ilaaj hua
 And finally he was brought to Medanta Medicity Hospital in Gurgaon in an air ambulance
 shuruaati dinon ke baad haalat sudharne lagi thi
 a week ago, he started talking to family members in gestures and there was talk of being removed from the ventilator
 magar phir infections shuru ho gaya
 It increased and due to this their organs stopped working one by one
 mangalvaar ko vidya charan shukla ne antim saans lee
 The life which had gained momentum from the forest, suddenly stopped and stopped the last journey
 tyoharon ke sijan main sasti air tikat dene kii res main ab flite sarvice dene vaali mashhoor air india bhi shaamil ho gai he
 This public sector airline has again brought a bang scheme for its passengers on the occasion of Diwali

 raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar vipakshi partiyon main sahmati banane kii koshish main juty bijepi ke liye apni hi sahyogi shivasena ko manaanaa khaasaa mushkil sabit hota dikhaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, BJP President Amit Shah will meet Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday to convince Shiv Sena
 darasal shivasena ne raashtrapati pad ke liye emes swaminathan ko ummidavaar banane kaa suzav dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Earlier, she was adamant on the name of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, but neither the RSS nor the BJP appeared ready on it
 aise main sena ne apane kadam khinchate hue krishi vigyaan swaminathan kaa naam badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, 'we are a Hindu nation, so Mohan Bhagwat is our first choice
 lekin agar unke naam se koi samasya he, to ham emes swaminathan kaa naam suzaayenge
 Apart from the Hindu nation, we are also an agricultural nation
 kisanonki samasyaon kaa unke paas hal he, to phir swaminathan kyon nahin?'vahiin sena se jude se sutron kaa kahana he ki swaminathan gairraajnneetik shaks hai or krishi kshetra main unke yogadan ko dekhte hue sabhi partiyon ke liye ve sweekaarya honge
 Farmers have been demanding to implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Report for a long time, in such a way that the President will send a good message to the farmers

 The cabinet has approved 45 crore tax exemption to the ICC, knowing that crores of money are always kept in the ICC treasury, the ICC has been collecting crores of money by making the game of cricket a commercial activity

 lekin abhi bhi rajya main saamaajik sthiti ko badalane ke liye bahut kuch kiya janaa he
 Special work needs to be done in many important areas to improve the life of the common man

 desh ke ahm rajyon main garibi hataane kii koshishon main odisha ne yah kaam sabase tej raftaar se kiya he
 Behera said that the state government has taken several important steps for the farmers, which has resulted in Uttar Pradesh being one of the surplus states in rice production today
 vahiin rajya main sinchai kii vyavastha beete ek ek dashak ke dauraan majboot kii gai he

 It can not only make Odisha the paramount state of the country but can also become the biggest hub of the steel industry for the entire country

 rajdhani dilli pichley kuch dinon se dhundh se lard rahi he
 i am longing to breathe
 engiti or dilli hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar, emsidi or punjab-haryana ko bhi fatkaar lagaai he
 After which the Delhi government has decided to implement Aud Even for 5 days
 lekin kya sirf od ivan se hi dilli ye pradooshan kii jang jeet paaegi
 Or some more drastic steps need to be taken
 1
 Is the capital environment friendly? Constructions are being made daily in the city in the name of development
 lekin kya dilli main usee prakaar ke saath hi envyranment friendli banane par kaam ho rahaa he
 If you want to fight pollution then the city has to be made green, trees and plants have to be promoted
 taaki oonchi imaaraton se ghire is shahar main hawa kii sthiti main badlaav aae
 And people can breathe
 iske saath hi audyogic niti par bhi bal dene kii jarurat he, kyonki agar rajdhani main hi jagah-jagah kaarkaanon se dhuaan nikalegaa to saans lenaa dubhar hi hoga
 2
 nirmaan kaary ke liye ho niyamalagataar ho rahe nirmaan kaary or usase fail rahe pradooshan ke liye engiti ne bhi sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai he
 All types of construction work have been banned in Delhi
 lekin ye roak kuch hi din ke liye he, sarkaar ko agar koi thos upaay nikaalnaa he
 So there is a need to make any rules for construction works in the capital
 kyonki dilli main naa sirf sarkari kaamkaaj ho rahaa he balki rojaanaa nijee nirmaan kaary bhi ho rahaa he jisase pradooshan par dohari maar padati he
 3
 padosi rajyon kii bhoomikadilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki dilli main jo pradooshan he wo sirf sthaneey kaarnon ke kaaran nahin he
 Significantly, these days in UP, Haryana and Punjab adjoining Delhi, farmers burn stubble, whose smoke spreads all around
 iskaa kuch asar dilli par bhi padataa he
 Therefore, Delhi will have to make some concrete plans with its neighboring states to control pollution
 haalanki, ye kahana bhi galat hoga ki sirf padosi rajyon or paraali jalaane ke kaaran hi dilli main pradooshan ho rahaa he
 4
 public transportdilli desh kii rajdhani he
 Millions of people travel here every day, millions of people drive on their own vehicles, two-wheelers
 sarkaar ko public transport ko behatar bananaa hoga, taaki agar koi apane nijee vaahanon ko tyaag kar dilli main safar karnaa chaahe to use pareshaani naa ho
 Apart from diesel buses, the government will also have to increase focus on electric buses
 iske alaava shahar main cycle trek kii bhi vyavastha ho taaki logon ko cycle ke liye badhaava mil sake
 There is a metro in the city, but now people are scared to travel even after seeing the increased fares
 5
 Vestage management being the capital, Delhi always remains in the eyes of the world
 lekin jagah-jagah laga kooday kaa dher naa sirf gandagi failaate hai balki maahaul ko pradooshit karte hai
 There are also many landfill sites in Delhi where garbage piles are kept
 dilli ke sthaneey log bhi kahin bhi kuch bhi jala dete hai jisase dhuaan hota he
 The state government-mcd-center will have to take concrete steps to keep Delhi clean
 rajdhani ke liye ek sakht vestage management kii jarurat he taaki maahaul dooshit naa ho
 The problem of pollution is becoming a problem for people just before winter in the country's capital
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki sarkari agenciyon ke daavon ke ulatdillike kai hisson main jamkar niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai
 The team of 'aaj Tak' has done a reality check to prevent the causes of pollution
 india get or raashtrapati bhawan se mahaj kuch duuri par niyamon kii andekhi karte hue pradooshan ko aamantran diya ja rahaa he
 Many tall piles of soil are seen in the open on the Rajpath without any green cover
 ek taraf dilli kii hawa karaab he, to vahiin mitti ke dher ke khilaaf karrwai karne vaali agenciyaan bhi gaayab hai
 Let me tell you that during construction work it is compulsory not to cover malwa, sand or other material with green cover, while Rajpath was found to openly ignore this rule
 dilli main PM 10 or PM 2
 The level of 5 is constantly increasing
 udhar 'ajtak' khaas baatcheet ke dauraan dilli ke paryaavaran mantriimran hussainne bataaya ki paryaavaran vibhaag kii 15 team pradooshan se nipatane ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Apart from this, a committee of 6 members has been formed
 is kamity kaa makasad auchak nirikshan karnaa he taaki pradooshan failaane waalon or isaki vajahon ko pahchaan kar par turant karrwai kii ja sake
 According to Minister Imran Hussain, the 6-member committee will have one member each of departments like MCD, PWD, Delhi Police
 saath hi dilli main 83 marshall bhi pradooshan par nigaraanee rakh rahe hai
 These marshals will roam in different areas and take action against those who spread garbage, dust pollution
 dilli sarkaar ne centre sarkaar se paraali ke mudde par kisaanon ko muaavja dene kii maang doharaai he
 Recently pictures of stubble burning were revealed from the neighboring states of Delhi
 paryaavaran mantri imran hossain kaa daawa he ki dilli main pradooshan kii mukhya vajah padosi rajyon ke khet-khalihaanon main kisaanon dwaara jalaai jane vaali paraali he

 The rebellious attitude of Kapil Mishra is not the only difficulty of the Aam Aadmi Party
 party ke nilambit vidhayak amanatulla khan or kumaar vishwaas ke bich jang bhi thami nahin he
 This fight has again emerged from the posters outside the office of the Aam Aadmi Party
 postaron main kya he?postaron main amanatulla khan ko vidhansabha kii sabase zyada cametiyon ko member or chairman banane par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko badhai di gai he
 It is also written, 'the jeweler only identifies the diamond
 ' haalanki khabar uchhalane ke baad poster hataa die gaye hai
 The figure of thirty-six is well known between Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan and Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar vishwaas kii baithak se pehle posterye poster aaj subah chaspaan kiye gaye hai
 Today was the first meeting with the party leaders of the state, Kumar Vishwas as Rajasthan in-charge
 meeting main shariq hone pahunche kumaar vishwaas ne kaha ki postaron ke bare main 'yaa to heere se poocha jaae yaa johari se
 'why the feud between Amanatullah and Vishwas? After the defeat in the MCD election, Amanatullah Khan described Kumar Vishwas as an agent of BJP and RSS
 unka aarope tha ki kumaar vishwaas party main takhtapalat kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 Amanatullah was suspended from the party to convince the angry Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar kaa kahana tha ki amanatulla party ke hi kuch netaaon ke ishaare par aarope laga rahe hai
 a few days later, Kejriwal gave him a place in several committees in the Delhi Assembly

 Jiah Khan came to Mumbai from across the sea with big dreams
 amitabh bachchan ke saath shuruyaat bhi damdaar rahi
 Also worked with Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar but very few people know that Jiya was born in America and brought up in London
 nafisa khan urf jiya khan kii khudakushi kii vajah philhal rahasy ke parde main lipati hui he lekin jiya kaa zikr hote hi jahan main tair jaati he jiya kii abhinay kii wo tamaam tasviren jisamen unhone sanjeeda or shandaar adaakaari se darshakon or film samikshakon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa tha
 On 20 February this year, Jia celebrated her 25th birthday
 jiya khan kaa janm 20 farvari 1988 main neuyork main hua tha
 Father Ali Rizvi Khan was an American citizen of Indian descent, while mother Rabia Amin was a Hindi film actress
 parvarish saat samandar paar landan main hui
 Zia Khan's inherited passion for acting was from childhood, so she completed film acting and English literature in London and New York
 filmon kaa satarangi aakarshan or bollywood main apane sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye jiya ne hindustan kaa rukh kiya
 People came to know Zia Khan's name, face and acting when her first Hindi film Nishabd was released in March 2007
 pehali film or wo bhi sadi ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ke saath
 It could not have been a better and better start to a film career
 apni pehali hi film 'nishabd' ke liye jiya ko filmphere ke best femail debyue ke aword ke liye nominet kiya gaya
 In 2008, Jiah's second Hindi film 'ghajini' was released
 is film main bhi jiya ko mistar parfectionist aamir khan ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 Jiah's last and third Hindi film, released in 2010, was 'housefull' with Akshay Kumar as her hero
 jiya khan kaa bollywood ke rangamanch kaa safar beshak 3 filmon kaa hi rahaa lekin in teen filmon ke jariye hi jiya ne apni adaakaari, apni sanjidagi or apni kaabiliyat se darshakon kaa saakshaatkaar kara diya
 The film journey was small, but the three celebrities who got the opportunity to work with the big screen in all three films, so far, many famous celebrities have not got any luck
 jiya ko filmon main acting ke alaava saamaajik muddon se bhi gajab kaa sarokaar tha
 To ensure the safety of animals, Jia was the ambassador of an institution called PETA
 iske alaava jiya kai raahat sansthaaon kii aarthik madad ke liye kaam kar chuki thim
 Very few people would know that Jiya was also a trained singer and dancer
 jiya hawa ke halke jhonke kii tarah ain or phija main apni khushboo bikher kar chali gayi
 Leaving the world like this at just 25 years is no less than a nightmare, but it is definitely that Jia's younger age will be remembered for a long time
 shaasha ke rup main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii shakhsiyat kaa sabase majboot pahalu he samaaj or us kshetra kii mahaan vibhootiyon kii ateet kii uplabdhiyon ke prati janata ke man main garv ke ehsaas ko jagaanaa
 This is also the story of his amazing ability and success
 phir is anubhuti ko ve rashtriya garv kii bhaavana ke saath jod dete hai
 They do all this work in many ways
 masalan ganatantr diwas or swatantraaa diwas jaise maukon par unke bhaashan or suvyavasthit pradarshaniyaan, tathaa saath main dikhaane ke liye documentries
 Exhibitions and documentaries presenting the history of a particular region form an important part of their programs
 misaal ke taur par 2011 ke unke jila stareey sadbhaavna mishan ko hi lijie
 In order to spread the message of communal harmony to the public, an exhibition on the geographical features and history of the place was held simultaneously, including the great men of that district, the natural resources and the story of struggle against British rule, saints and other great martyrs
 Folk heroes were told
 junagarh kii pradarshnee main apa giga ke bare main bataaya gaya tha, jo junagarh ke mahaan shahid lokanayak the
 His spiritual aura and dedicated social service to the poor made an indelible mark on the hearts of the local people 200 years ago
 unke ashram main aaj bhi lungar chalata he
 Similarly, in Anand, the focus was on Cooperative Leader Tribhuvandas Patel, who identified a person like Varghese Kurien, who started the milk revolution in the country
 navsari main do saal pehle parsi samudaay ke ek samaaroh main unhone parsiyon ko ek dastavej kii jaanch ke liye bulaayaa or swami vivekanand or jamshedji tata ke bich kii 1890 main hui mulaakaat par ek naatak kaa manchan karne kii baat rakhi
 His most historic and unprecedented initiative towards creating a sense of pride in the minds of the people was to celebrate the annual celebrations of Independence Day and Republic Day in a new district every year instead of celebrating it in the state capital Gandhinagar
 unhone yah faisla usee samay le liya tha jab 2001 main unhone padbhaar sambhala or us din se ab tak lagbhag sabhi 26 jilon main ve aisa aayojan kar chuke hai
 In 2003, Modi set another example when he brought back the ashes of the great revolutionary, freedom fighter and social reformer Pandit Shyamji Krishna Verma, who died in 1930, on the soil of the country
 verma kii vasiyat main likhaa tha ki unka asthi kalash switzraland main rakhaa jaae or tabhi bharat waapas bheja jaae jab vah british shashan se aaazaad ho jaae
 Modi not only made his ashes touch the motherland, but also built a beautiful memorial in his memory at Varma's birthplace in Mandvi, Kutch
 verma 1900-1930 ke dauraan england or europe main bharat kii aazaadee ke liye lagaataar sangharsh karte rahe
 The freedom fighters staying at his India House in London included Mahatma Gandhi, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Veer Savarkar, Virendranath Chattopadhyay, Lala Hardayal, as well as Vladimir Lenin
 pandit jawahar laal nehru ne 1920 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon main verma se mulaakaat kii, jab ve biimaar the
 When Varma died in 1930 in Geneva, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru (he was being tried in the assembly bomb case at the time) paid tribute to him in Lahore Jail
 lekin 2003 main unka asthi kalash desh kii aazaadee ke 55 saal baad aayaa
 In these five decades no government has shown sensitivity to respect the wishes of that great revolutionary
 aazaadee ke sangharsh main thos yogadan ke baavjood aaazaad desh kii mitti par paanv rakhane kii unki aas puri na ho pai, par desh ke us nirbhik laal kii yaad main modi kaa banwaaya bhavy smarak aaj sailaaniyon ke aakarshan kaa centre ban chukaa he
 Modi has also taken a unique step to elevate the building of glorious saga on the foundation of spirituality
 indore ke rahane vaale aadhyatmik guru bhaiyyu maharaj ke suzav par modi ne uttari gujarat main 1,000 acre jameen par ek sant nagari (city of cents) banavaa rahe hai
 This city will be divided into as many parts on the basis of the number of Indian states, and each part will be named after each state and a copy of the ashrams of the prominent saints of that particular state will be made there
 inamen sufi santon ko bhi shaamil karte hue unki kahani bataai jaaegi
 Some aspects of Modi's personality also look quite complex
 udhaaharan ke liye, unka hathi rukh, jise akasar log ahankaar maan baithte hai
 This sometimes raises doubts in the minds of people about their attitude
 janata kii seva ke liye samarpit gujarat rajya vidhansabha ke bijepi vidhayak dow
 In 2008, when Kanu Kalsaria raised his own government on the permission to set up a cement plant in the coastal area of mahuwa near Bhavnagar, considering the environmental and economic consequences, Modi refused to talk to him and the project Flagged off nateeja yah hua ki pariyojna or kalsaaria donon hi modi se dur ho gaye
 Kalsaria angrily left the BJP and the Supreme Court stayed her, considering her petition filed against the project
 ab 2014 main kalsaaria aam aadmi party main shaamil ho gaye
 It is also said about Modi that he has a passion to promote himself and he takes the role of looting big accolades from the smallest thing
 puure gujarat main tamaam sarkari yojanaon ke bare main lagaae gaye chote-bade hording se jhaankati unki raubadaar tasveeron ko prachaar ke prati unke lagaav ke saboot ke taur par pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But Modi does not mind
 2007 main maine ek baar unase is bare main sawaal kiya to unhone palatakar mujh se hi sawaal kar daalaa, “main aisa kyon na karun, jab main achche kaam kar rahaa hum? yah meraa adhikaar he
 Nobody works hard for long like me
 saath hi log mujhe pyaar karte hai or mujhe sunate hai
 It is part of my strategy to make my plans popular by using my name
 ” unki daleel kaaphi had tak sahi bhi he
 There is hardly a Chief Minister in India who works hard like Modi and keeps a keen eye on every little bit of governance
 vyaktigat taur par un par lagane vaala ek purana aarope yah he ki apane rajnatik sahyogiyon ke prati unka vyavhaar behad thanda or matlab bhar kaa rahata he
 However, Modi has always denied this personally
 yahi vajah he ki unke sthaayee doston main gine-chune hi log hai
 In response to this allegation, Modi begins to give many examples of the kindness shown to his colleagues
 is sambandh main modi se judaa ek dilachasp vakya he
 One day when Modi did not come to see an old ailing colleague, he called Modi and complained about not coming
 modi ne theth alphaaj main kaha, “mere sharir kii banaavat main ek manuphaccharing dosha he
 Even if i feel something for someone, i am unable to express it correctly
 tum jab kabhi mujh main aisi nakaaratmakataa dekho, mujhe turant bataao
 If i get the point right, i will fix it
 ” agle hi din modi apane sahyogi ko dekhne uske ghar pahunch gaye
 Such behavior of Modi shows his utter candor, ingenuity with ease and the urge to learn
 meraa anubhav bhi aisa hi kuch tha jab 2006 main ek din unhone mujhe phone kiya or kaha ki “ab sangh parivaar ke ek varg or mere bich kuch matbhed ubhar aae hai
 They can spread false stories about me
 aap ham donon ko achche se jaanate hai or ek patrkaar hone ke naate aap khud se bhi koi najariya banane ke liye aaazaad hai
 But before making any negative image let me examine it well
 ”unke lambey-chaude daavon ne bhi kai baar unhen mushkil main daalaa he or unki chhavi kharaab kii he
 In 2007, he claimed that Gujarat State Petroleum, a state government subsidiary, found a source of 20 TCF gas in the Krishna Godavari basin, while the Directorate of Hydrocarbons investigated that it was just 2 TCF
 lekin is kahani main modi sarkaar kaa apana paksh bhi he
 Their officials claim that only 17 square miles of 500 square miles of area under the GSPC in the KG Basin have been excavated
 isliye bhavishya main adhik gas paane kii ummid abhi kaayam he
 With the ability to form an unbiased perception, Modi has another quality that is equally essential for a good ruler — a manner in which he behaves and behaves with his supporters as well as his opponents
 Create fear
 iskaa samarthakon par asar yah hota he ki ve modi kii banaai nitiyon or faislon par aksharshah amal karte hai
 At the same time, the problem of opponents is that they do not understand how to fight an enemy who has no idea of the next step
 modi apane aasapaas ek kaddavar or rahasyamay gheraa banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 This is because when they are considering to take a decision on important issues, their close ones do not have a clue about it till the last moments
 modi kii isi style ne unki prashasnic-rajnatik safalataa main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he kyonki yah unke maatahaton ko unke faislon kaa aankh moond kar paalan karne ke baadhya karata he
 For example, after the 2007 assembly elections when everyone expected that an elderly person would be made the Speaker of the Assembly, Modi gave the position to 42-year-old tribal MLA Ganpat Vasava
 vaasav gujarat ke itihaas main sabase kam umr ke vidhansabha adhyaksh bane or is mukaam tak pahunchane vaale pehle adivasee bhi
 When discussing any issue with his subordinates, even if there is any doubt in his mind, Modi does not let the idea of the thoughts swirl in his mind, but if he is fully confident about a decision or policy, then open-hearted support They show
 shaayad unhone apane man main chanakya ko guru pad par bitha rakhaa he jinhone arthshaastra main kaha he, “raja ke parivaar ko bhi pataa na chale ki kal vah kya faisla lene ja rahaa he
 "as far as management skills are concerned, his supporters in the Sangh also regard him as an iron
 yahaan ek udhaaharan pesh karnaa jaruri he
 In 1969, Modi was overseeing a Sangh training camp in Sidhpur, northern Gujarat
 sangh main modi ke maardarshak divangat lakshmanarav inaamdaar ne unhen 50,000 rupayon se bharaa bag apane paas rakhane ko diya or prashikshan ke antim din use lautaa dene ko kaha
 When Inamdar asked him how he would keep the money, Modi replied, "leave it to me
 ye mere paas ekadam surakshit rahenge
 Late in the night, Modi dug a pit under a tree near the training camp and pressed the bag into it
 agle do dinon tak subah or shaam modi thik usee jagah par dusron ke saath baith jate or prashikshan se judi ranneeti par baaten kiya karte
 On the last day, when Modi went to that place with Inamdar ji and removed the bag from the soil, he was shocked to see Modi's skill
 modi ko kaaphi kareeb se jaanane vaale bijepi netaa or sangh ke ek bade netaa ke putr parendu bhagat urf kaku ji kehete hai, “pehle din se hi unke nae-nae idia or kaam karne ke tareeke ne sabko prabhavit kiya tha
 “another incident about Modi emerges in my mind
 aktubar 2002 main hindutv kii jabardast lahar ke daur main modi ek rath par savaar gujarat gaurav yatra par nikle
 i also got a chance to participate in his rath yatra in the tribal areas of Gujarat
 jab ham chota udaipur shahar se nikal rahe the, modi kii najar haath hilaakar unka abhivadan karte ek muslim dampati par padi
 Modi asks the driver to stop the chariot
 us aadmi ne gale main bhaajapai scorf lapet rakh rakhaa tha
 They had two small daughters with that couple
 donon kii umr saat saal se kam hi rahi hogi
 As we stopped, the man came to Modi with his family
 usne apana parichay ek sthaneey bijepi kaaryakarta ke taur par diya
 Modi touched the cheek of a girl with great affection and said, “send them to school at all costs
 main chahta hum ki inamen se koi ek to doctor yaa ejeeniyar jarur bane
 Come to me whenever there is a need
 ” jaise hi rath aage badha, bhavuk modi ne haath thapakaate hue kaha, “rajya ke logon se jitna pyaar mil rahaa he, use dekhakar main abhibhoot ho rahaa hum
 Today i have taken a vow
 gujarat ke logon ne mujh par jo bharosa jataayaa he, use kabhi nahin todoonga
 "if you judge his visit as Chief Minister on the basis of both controversies and achievements, you will find that Modi has kept his promise
 jitna unhone khud sochaa ho, shaayad usase kahin adhik

 How serious any government is on the decision to pay compensation to the victims, this can be understood from the attitude of the present Modi government
 pradhanmantrinarendra modi kii sarkaar ne pehle sikh danga peeditonko 5-5 lakh rupee muaavja dene kii ghoshnaa kii, phir chunaav ayog ke sawaal karne par inkaar kiya or ab kendriya cabinet ne maheene bhar kii uthapatak ke baad 1984 ke dangon ke peediton ke liye paanch-paanch lakh rupee kaa muaavja dene ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya he

 Despite the possibility of an anti-incumbency trend from the BJP being in command of Gujarat for 22 years, despite lot of uneasiness among businessmen regarding GST and demonetisation, despite the movement of patidar-obc-thakor-dalits, lotus blooms again in Gujarat Is going
 india today-exis maai india opinian pole ke mutabik bijepi apane garh maane jane vaale is rajya ko apane paas hi barkaraar rakhane ja rahi he
 The Axis My India Polling Agency accurately predicted Modi's storm in the 2014 Lok Sabha election
 iske baad agency ke dilli, bihar or uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke anumaan bhi sahi sabit hue
 According to an opinion poll conducted by Axis from September 15 to October 15 for all 182 Assembly seats in Gujarat, the BJP is going to win the 115 to 125 seats
 bijepi ke liye 2007 or 2012 main hue gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main kamovesh aise hi nattejey dekhne ko mili the
 According to opinion poll, Gujarat's main opposition party Congress is seen getting 57 to 65 seats
 2012 ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 60 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 Samples of 18243 participants were collected in the Axis My India poll
 48% pratibhaagiyon ne bijepi ko vot dene kii baat kahi
 At the same time 38% expressed their opinion in favor of Congress
 do dhuron vaali daud main voton main 10 fisadi kaa antar ye jataane ke liye paryaapt he ki bijepi satta virdohi rujhaan ko maat dete hue phir gujarat kii satta par kabiz hone ja rahi he
 Being in power in Gujarat for 22 years, the possibility of anti-incumbency against BJP has been talked about
 opinian pole dikhaata he ki congress ne 32 fisadi votaron main badhat banaai hui hai
 These include 10% Muslim, 6% Dalit and 16% Patidar
 vahiin bijepi ne nirnaayak 67% votaron par majboot pakad banaai hui he
 These include OBC 37%, ST 15% and General 15%
 is opinian pole ne obisi yuva netaa alpesh thakor or dalit activist jignesh mewaani ke samarthan se congress ko milane vaale atirikt voton kii sambhaavna kaa sangyaan liya he
 But this opinion poll has not taken cognizance of the additional votes that can go to the opposition's account in the face of Patidar leader Hardik Patel's support to the Congress
 beete kuch varshon se hardik patel patidaar samudaay ke prabhaavshaalee netaa ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aae hai
 The Patidars are considered a strong community in Gujarat from a political perspective
 gujarat ke kul votaron main patidaaron kii hissedari 16% he
 Patidar is in a position to play a decisive role on 21 of the 182 seats in Gujarat
 hardik ko lekar abhi tak uhapoh he ki ve congress ko sidhe samarthan denge yaa nahin
 In his rallies, Hardik has been insisting that he wants his supporters to overthrow the arrogant BJP attacking the Patidar youth
 ' haalanki hardik ne abhi tak congress ke liye khule samarthan ke elaan se bhi parhez kiya he
 On Monday, Hardik made every effort to keep his meeting with Congress leaders in Ahmedabad secret
 aadhikarik taur par hardik ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath mulaakaat hone se inkaar kiya he
 At the same time, some Congress leaders say that such a meeting actually took place in a hotel room in Ahmedabad
 exis maai india opinian pole main pratibhaagiyon se poocha ki kya ve us party ke saath jaaenge jise hardik samarthan dene kaa elaan karenge
 2% of the total participants said that the Patidar Youth Turks (hardik) would support the party they called
 exis maai india pole ne doosraa paridrishy bhi pratibhaagiyon ke saamne rakhaa
 Asked what will be the stand if Hardik Patel officially declares his support for the Congress
 exis maai india ke polsters ke mutabik agar hardik khule taur par congress ke samarthan kaa elaan karte hai to is party kaa vot share 38% se badhkar 40% ho saktaa he
 In such a scenario, the Congress could benefit from 5 to 10 more seats
 itnaa hi nuksaan bijepi ko seat sankhya main ho saktaa he
 Hardik's support to the Congress will hurt the BJP, but it will not be so big that in this election with high voltage, his stronghold will be out of his hands
 is chunaav ko modi-shah kii taqatvar jodi ke liye bhi saakh kaa sawaal mana ja rahaa he
 However, it should be kept in mind that this opinion poll took place before 15 October
 openian pole ke liye field se semple liye jane ke baad hui ghatnaon kaa asar isamen shaamil nahin he
 What is visible is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the biggest attraction for the BJP in the elections
 66% pratibhaagiyon kaa maananaa he ki narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad se gujarat ko phayda hua
 a large proportion of 74% of the participants believe that the Narendra Modi government has done well or very well
 gujarat main bijepi ko avashya satta virdohi rujhaan ke dabaav kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he lekin isse ‘dharti-putr’ kii saakh par koi asar nahin hua he jo desh ke pradhanmantri kii gaddi tak pahunchaa
 Modi magic has been working for the last several elections in Gujarat and despite strong anti-incumbency trends, the voters of the state reposed faith in Modi
 opinian pole ke anumaan bataate hai ki gujarat ke naagarik ab bhi modi ke mohpash main hai
 The biggest headache for the BJP is proving to be the uneasiness of the traders regarding Goods and Service Tax
 gujarat ko vyapaariyon ke varchasv vaala rajya mana jaataa he
 Over half of the participants in the opinion poll stated that they were dissatisfied with the GST
 sirf 38% ne hi GST kaa anumodan kiya
 It is clear from the poll data that people are angry with the way the GST was implemented
 lekin ye saaf nahin he ki GST ko lekar naaraazgi kya votaron ke rukh par bhi asar daalegi
 The merchant class of Gujarat has long been considered a strong supporter of the BJP
 kya ye vyapaaree GST ko lekar bijepi ko khaarij karne kii had tak jaaenge? ye gujarat chunaav kaa yaksha prashn mana ja rahaa he
 BJP is doing everything possible to allay the displeasure of the business community on its behalf
 isi vajah se jiesti kii jatiltaaon ko dur karne kii baat bhi kii ja rahi he

 kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne kisaanon ke mudde par bijepi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshishon par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 In India Today's program 'agro Summit and Awards 2018', he said, "in the last four years after Modi became the Prime Minister, there have been many far-reaching agricultural reforms, which are beginning to benefit
" sarkaar ne pichley chaar saal main jitna kaam kiya, pichhali sarkaar ne 10 saal ke kaarykaal main wo kaam nahin kiye
 "counting the achievements of the government in the field of agrarian reform, Radhamohan Singh said," Earlier the black market of urea used to be done through the thief door
 pehali baar atal bihari vaajapeyi ke shashan main pehali baar is par chintaa jaahir kii gai
 Atal ji spoke to the scientists and asked them to initiate measures against it
 iske baad vaigyanikon kii team ne 2003 or 2004 main tamaam tarah kii research or field trial kiya
 The team also submitted a report to the Ministry of Agriculture and recommended 'neem coated' urea to the government to prevent black marketing / adulteration
 " radhamohan singh ne aarope lagaaya, "lekin ab vahi log (congress) sawaal uthaa rahe hai jinhone 2004 se 2014 ke bich kisaanon ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 "stopping urea kala bajar, Radha Mohan Singh counted the achievements of the government," when a poor's son (narendra Modi) became the Prime Minister, he said- Look at what happened (on Atalji's concern about urea black marketing)
 hamane dekha, to pataa chalaa ki filein alamira kii shobhaa badha rahi hai
 But we then started working on the recommendation of scientists
 radhamohan singh ne kaha ki ab ham kah sakate hai ki sarkaar banane ke do varsh ke andar hi neem coted uria aata he
 Urea goes to the market only after neem is coated from abroad
 ye sudhaar he
 Its results are also visible
 " unhone kaha, "ab kahin uria kii kalabazari nahin hoti
 The benefit of prohibition is seen in adulteration
 ab 100 kilo ke badale 80 kilo uria kheton main kaam kar rahaa he
 "kamaradhamohan Singh on Swil Health also alleged that nothing worked on 'swil Health' in the previous government
 unhone kaha, "2007 main puri duniya main ye baat uthi ki 'swil health' par kaam kiya jaae
 Earlier, states used to get money for this
 kahin-kahin lab ban jaataa tha
 But it had no standard
 unhone bataaya ki bharat sarkaar kii ore se ek paisa 'swil health' ke liye nahin diya jaataa tha
 Before our government there were about 44 labs for Swile Health
 " unhone bataaya, "aaj desh main 10 hajaar chote-bade 'swil health lab' ban chuke hai
 It is the result of the efforts of the government that today, in the first phase, more than 10 thousand farmers in the whole country have also received Swill Health Card
 "anaaj mandiyon kii i-marketing ko lekar radhamohan singh ne kaha, "ise lekar congress kii sarkaar ne 10 saal main sirf ek baithak kii
 However, during this period, the Government of Karnataka started working on it
 jab ham sarkaar main aae to hamen isaki chintaa hui
 There were meetings of all the Agriculture Ministers and related officers of the country
 585 mandiyaan jud gayi
 Although not as much as we wanted, but today we can say that more than half of our mandis have e-marketing
 aage sabhi main hoga
 "farmers are getting benefits from e-marketing," he said, "where there is e-marketing in the mandis, farmers are benefiting from it
 iske liye main sambandhit logon ko jarur badhai dena chaahunga
 We will add 1000 more mandis to it
 ham isamen pashu bazaar ko bhi shaamil karenge
 "he said," though 'livestock Haats' will start separately
 iskaa portal jari kiya gaya he
 The Agriculture Minister said that after this a separate fund will be created for 22 thousand Gramin Haats
 isamen manaregaa ko lagaaya, pradhanmantri sadak yojana ko lagaaya
 All the states are also cooperating in this
 " unhone bataaya, "bhavishya main 22 hajaar mandiyon ko i-marketing se jodenge
 If the previous government had added, we would have been far ahead today
 2022 tak ham bade lakshya tak pahunch jaaenge
 We are getting good results
 "radhamohan ne kaha, "jab ham 2022 kii baat karte hai to uskaa asar pichley chaar saal ke andar najar aata he
 In May, thousands of farmers gathered in all the blocks of the country
 unhone apni kahaniyaan bataai

 Paper ballots were used to elect representatives from 194 municipal councils and 423 nagar panchayats of the state

 kya hoga ab pakistan kaa
 This question is very natural today because the Taliban issued another new threat
 taliban ne elaan kar diya ki wo pakistan kii rajdhani islamabad par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Swat was first swallowed and now Islamabad is on target
 jis hisaab se taliban ke aatanki mansoobey har din paravaan chadh rahe hai use dekhte hue ye chetavanee vaaki khatarnaak he
 Taliban has shaken the whole world due to the acts of terror and its terrorist intent
 pakistan to pehle se hi taliban naam ke jehar kaa ghaav jhel rahaa he or pakistan kii jananath swat ghati talibaniyon ke kabje main aa chuki he
 Now the Taliban have also focused their attention on Islamabad and openly announced that our next target could be Pakistan's capital Islamabad
 pakistan ke ek akhbaar international da news ke mutabik taliban kii ye dhamkee islamabad kii deevaaron par likhi ja rahi he jise shahar kaa prashasan dhulwane main laga he
 At one time, Swat, called the paradise of Pakistan, currently speaks of the Taliban and the distance from Swat to Islamabad is not very much
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki islamabad se pakistan kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar lahore bhi paas hi he
 But the most dangerous thing is that the indo-pak border is not too far from Lahore
 yani khatra sidhe-sidhe bharat ko bhi he
 Given the way the Taliban is slowly swallowing Pakistan, calling this new threat nonsense would probably be a big mistake
 taliban ne apane sandesh main saaf kar diya he ki islamabad ke log yaa to taliban kaa samarthan karen yaa phir shahar ko hameshaa ke liye chhod den
 If their order is not fulfilled, then they should be ready to face the consequences
 taliban apane kai thikaanon par pakistan sarkaar kii karrwai se tilamilaayaa hua he
 The Taliban have declared an attack on Islamabad against the action of the Pakistan government in the Swat Valley and the Pass Adamakhel
 pehle afgaan-paak seemaa par kabja, phir pakistan ke phata ilaake par kabja, uske baad swat kaa satyanaash or ab islamabad par taliban kii giddh najar
 Of course, the case is very dangerous
 taliban is kadar ghaatak ho chukaa he ki ab usne lashkar-e-taiyaba, harakatul mujahidin or hijbul mujahidin jaise aatanki sanghathanon ko bhi dhamkee de daali he

 Of course, this scene of mine looked easy but it was very difficult to shoot it
 yah seen barish main shoot hua, maine jaise walk karnaa shuru kii chehre par pani padaa
 Then what was there

 Then the entire shooting was stopped and Nargis ji came to me
 unhone kaha ki main tumhen chocolate duungi
 You shut up us vakt ek chocolate ke badale maine bina roe barish main chalate hue apni jindagi kaa pehla shot diya tha
 This scene was very special because i had my first scene in Papa's film

 Then father told mother that i want Chintu to play my childhood role in the film

 maine maa-papa ke saath apana khaanaa khaaya or unke saamne koi riection nahin diya
 Rishi Kapoor told that i was so happy about the work in the film that i came directly from the dining table to my room
 vahaan pahunchakar maine pen-paper nikaala or autograph dene kii practice karne laga
 Rishi Kapoor, who used to see himself crying in a mirror, during the interview, Rishi Kapoor said that i used to cry badly after eating mother's body in childhood
 rone ke baad main hameshaa shishe main apni shakl dekhtaa rahata tha
 i do not remember this thing correctly, but Shashi Kapoor Uncle used to always remind me of this

 Bathing is an important part of our daily routine
 par kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki nahaana jaruri kyon he? agar aapse koi puche to shaayad aap yahi kahen ki nahaane se taazgi bani rahati he jisase dinabhar kaam karne ke liye energy milti he
 But bathing does not have the same benefits
 nahaane ke or bhi kai aise phaayde hai jin par hamaara dhyaan hi nahin jaataa he
 Advantages of bathing everyday: 1
 kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki paseene se badboo kyon aati he? darasal, paseene kii badboo bacteria ke kaaran hoti he
 Regular bathing is less likely for bacteria to flourish
 aise main tan se durgandh bhi kam aati he

 If your skin is not clean then the chances of getting pimples increases
 jisase aapaki twachaa kii raunak ja sakati he
 Bathing everyday does not cause dirt to accumulate on the face, which does not cause bacteria to grow and causes problems

 No, bathing causes many skin problems
 zyada din nahin nahaane se khujali kii samasya bhi ho jaati he

 In his words, “the attitude of making such films comes from living on the streets
 jahaan tak meri baat he, mujhe to usee duniya ne hameshaa khinchaa haih sadak kaa aadmi us duniya ke bheetar kaise ghusata he jisamen vah hameshaa baahar se jhaankta rahaa ho

 "it is Apnaa who still haunts them
 gangs of vasepur ho yaa dev di (2009), anuraag ke saare kirdaar takreeban gaiyr-bambaia hai
 These characters pass through the same Bombay sieve that Kashyap had coined, where in the dark of night the man turns to foul steam, then women, as critic Roger Ebert once said, kill you in your love
 nariwadiyon se lekar film udyog tak main aisa maahaul he jaise anuraag ne unka kuch bigaad diya ho
 He says, "these people cannot bear anything on themselves
 ham log latife bhi nahin suna sakate kyonki isse unke paakhand kaa pardaafash hota he
 "this is the reason behind his association with the younger generation of Bollywood
 is bebaaki main khed naam kii cheez nahin he
 Apparently, Anurag acts as a mentor to all the sorry people - from Anushka Sharma to Nimrat Kaur, Nawazuddin Siddiqui to the AIB team
 ve kehete hai ki khud kii ladaai kabhi nahin rukne vaali he, “is desh main cinema ke myne karod or jiro kii ginati he or isi se tay kiya ja rahaa he ki kya sahi he or kya galat
 The person who cannot make money is wrong and the person who makes money is right
 ek nishchit kism ke cinema ko bachaae rakhane ke liye agar aapako ladanaa he to aapako kuch balidaan dena hoga
 You have to fight your own battle

 Anurag suddenly enters the light
 khaaki vardi or safed baniyaan main ek ganda pulisavaala, jisaki roendaar chaati par panne kaa haar latak rahaa he or moonchhen bilkul pulisavaale jaisi hai
 He is robbing the reputation of Tamil heroine Lakshmi, who is doing her first Hindi film

 He says, "I am a villain in real life too
" mere bare main yahi dharna he
 "and by saying this, they try to force themselves down
 aaj ve kuch raahat main dikh rahe hai
 They seem to have come out of the shell, hiding from their past, hiding their weaknesses
 ve kehete hai, “dark ek saapeksh shabd he
 Since everything in India is so soft and shiny that i look darker than that

 From this perspective, we can say that his life and the film have come out for the first time as Bombay Velvet is his first classic love story
 ve jor dekar kehete hai, “main nahin maanata ki mere adarshavaad main koi badlaav aayaa he
 Pessimism is gone
 ab main saamaanya sthiti main hum
 "he has now ceased to be angry and those who used to express his anger

 It is not really possible for a filmmaker like Anurag to make successful films by staying in India
 ve darshakon ko gramin or shahari main baantkar nahin dekhte
 He says, "I just try to see if i have enough viewers
" main paata hum ki mere paas paryaapt darshak hai jinke liye main waisi filmein bana saktaa hum jinamein meraa vishwaas he
 Although inside, i make films for the same person, only for myself

 This story is about all those things that coined Kashyapa

 Has stopped rushing social media for comments made about themselves
 “main likh rahaa hum, pard rahaa hum, filmein dekh rahaa hum, varjish kar rahaa hum or dating kar rahaa hum

 They just want to breathe a sigh of relief and France is the most friendly country in the world in terms of cinema
 duniya kaa sara cinema sabase pehle paris main relies hota he
 By learning French alone, a new world of influences can open
 anuraag ke shabdon main, “kisi cheez ke ant ke baad shuruyaat hi hoti he

 Kashyap's partners Vikas Bahl, Vikramaditya Motwane and Madhu Montena have also matured
 ve kehete hai, “vikaas or vikram hi zyaadaatar kaam kar rahe hai
 They are working ten times than me
 phantum ke peeche kii takat mukhya rup se vikaas or vikram hai
 Kashyap has no plans

 vaniprakashan @ gmail The year 2011 was the birth centenary year of many big creators - Faiz, Nagarjuna, Shamsher, Agnayya, Kedarnath Agarwal etc
 academik galiyaaron main janm shatabdi varsh kii dhooma rahi
 Papers and magazines carried out special issues and practiced their religion
 is puri prakriya main ashanuroop sabase vivaadaaspad sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan kaa 'agyeya' vyaktitv rahaa, or sarthak bhi
 This fact is evident in the fact that there is something in the personality and literature of the agnaya that communicates to the readers
 agyeya par likhe sansmaranon kii, do bhaagon vaali is kitaab apane apane agyeya ko om thanvi ne sampadit kiya he
 In this compilation, the memoirs of a hundred prominent people who are related to the agnate's contemporary and the agnaya in some form have been included
 yah pustak sansmaranon kii rasaadaaygi vaali koi saamaanya pustak na hokar ek sandarbh granth kii tarah he
 Its 'memoirs' contain memories from the person of the agnostic to literary life, as well as his date-wise biography, list of his works along with the year of publication, and a list of books related to the agnostic
 sansmaranon kii bhi do dilachasp visheshtaayen hai-ye sansmaran ek divangat lekhak ke prati shradhanjali maatr na hokar uske vyaktitv or lekhan kii vividh chhaviyon ko aalochanatmak dhang se prastut karte hai; duusare, isamen unke virodhiyon ke sansmaran bhi shaamil kiye gaye hai, yahaan tak ki kuch virodhiyon se bhi likhvaya gaya he
 Allowing the readers to form opinions on all sides is the hallmark of an honest editor and Om Thanvi has done his editor's religion well from Jansatta to this book
 thanvi ne ek acchhee bhoomika ke 'chaar shabd?' likhakar kitaab ko padhakar agyeya ko samajhane ke liye utarane waalon kaa rasta aasaan kar diya he-unhen raste kii jatiltaaon se parichit karake
 Last year, by writing travelogues like Muenjodaro, Thanvi has made an important intervention in the world of literature
 saamagree ke chayan or sampadan main sajagata is pustak main bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 Thanvi has written, explaining the characteristics of a good memoir-compilation, "A good memoir gives the pleasure of composition
 usamen tathy hote hai, ghatnaayen (yaa durghatnaayen) hoti hai, lekhak ke bare main he to uski kritiyon ke byore hote hai, kuch vivechan bhi hota he, par antat sansmaran smriti ke sahare samay kii saras punarrachana he
 "indeed, our own agnost is a reconstruction of the time in which the agnost were composed
 in sansmaranon main agyeya ke vividh rup saamne aae hai
 As a litterateur, the agnostic strongly intervened in genres such as poetry, story, novel, drama, satire, memoir, travelogue, diary, column, translation, essay, criticism, etc
, while guerrilla, yayavari, teaching, journalism, in life Handed in painting, sculpture, cinematography, cooking, carpentry, tailoring, hairstyle, gardening etc
 and tried to do something meaningful
 sau mahatvapurn lekhakon, aalochakon dwaara apane samay ke ek jaruri lekhak ke bare main likhnaa nishchit taur par mahatvapurn he
 And in order to make this venture worthwhile, besides compiling the previously published memoirs in journals and books, dozens of authors like Kunwar Narayan, Kedarnath Singh, Vishwanath Tripathi, Vijaymohan Singh, Ganga Prasad Vimal, Rajesh Joshi, etc
, specially for this book
 Written from, which brings freshness in the compilation
 thanvi ne pratipakshiyon ke aalochanatmak sansmaran chhapakar pathak ko 'agyeya chhavi' ko apni kalpana main srujit karne ke liye paryaapt avasar diya he
 In such a situation, it is a bit awkward to make the editor answer the allegations on the agnostic on the pretext of a long role
 sansmaranon ke sheershak pustak main sankalit saamagree ke saahitiyik str or mahatv kii purvapithika taiyaar karte najar aate hai, jaise 'sadak jahaan samaapt hoti he' (vishnu prabhakar), 'jiskaa vah akhet karata he' (krishna sobati), 'sannaate main chand' (prabhaash joshi), 'maanav kii teesri aankh' (vishwanath prasad tiwari), 'dedh shabd or jalebi' (pankaj bisht) aadi
 In this way, this compilation, prepared on the occasion of the agnostic birth centenary, will help to bring the life and literature of the agnostic to the center of discourse with disagreements and disagreements and will serve as a reference book for the scholars of the agnostic

 An interesting anecdote of romance has emerged in the jail in India in which many dreaded criminals are closed
 yah jail he rajdhani kii tihaad or isamen band apradhi he hathiyaaron kaa saudagar abhishek verma
 His foreign wife is also lodged in the same prison, but in a different part
 angreji akhbaar 'hindustan times' kii ek khabar ke mutabik, abhishek or uski romanian patni anka maaria niku har hafte jail main hi milte hai

 vahaan donon kaa romance chalata he
 Both also have dinner there
 yah meeting jail number 6 main bane ek chote-se kamare main hoti he
 Abhishek also comes there
 aisa avasar kisi ko nahin miltaa he, isliye baaki kaidi donon se khaar khaae hue hai
 They are troubled by this
 lekin jail ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah ek routine maamla he or isamen koi khaas baat nahin he
 He says that according to the jail rules, every prisoner has the right to meet a select person once a week
 anka videshi mahila hai or bharat main uskaa koi nahin he, isliye vah zyaadaatar baar abhishek se milanaa chaahati he
 But other female prisoners are angry with this meeting
 unka kahana he ki jail adhikari ek taraf to abhishek or uski patni ko romantic dinar kaa mauka to dete hai, lekin ve anya kaidiyon ke saath sautela vyavhaar karte hai
 They do not even allow other female prisoners to do makeup
 agar unase koi galati bhi ho jaati he, to sajaa ke taur par unhen apane ghar waalon se milane tak kaa adhikaar chin liya jaataa he
 He says this is wrong
 sabhi kaidi ek jaise hai, lekin is videshi mahila ko sabhi tarah ke kapade or gahane pahanane kaa adhikaar he
