 The Supreme Court dismissed Subramanian Swamy's petition
 unki maang thi ki chunaav ayog sonia gandhi ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kare
 According to Swamy, in 2004, Sonia Gandhi misinformed about her educational qualification
 do jajon kii bench ne kaha tha ki sonia gandhi ne jaankaree nahin chhipaai ki unhone cambries vishvavidyadalay ke lenaaks kook skool se angreji main certificate course kiya tha
 Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi University had never registered in that institution
 laut kar aate hai phir se vasundhara raaje ke halafname kii ore
 Lalit Modi is openly tweeting that he has documents on his handle
 is halafname main vasundhara raaje ke dastakhat hai
 In this, what Vasundhara Raje has written, not only Vasundhara but now also questions the Prime Minister's silence even deeper
 tippaniyan Vasundhara has written that in the 2008 assembly elections, the Congress party had run a lot of misinformation against me and Lalit
 unhone mere mukhyamantri kaal ke dauraan ham donon par bhrashtachar ke kai bebuniyaad aarope lagaae
 But by then Lalit Modi's name had become famous in the house of India, but rather the world of the world had come to know
 ipel kii shandaar kamyaabi ke baad lalit kii safalataa ko cricket jagat ke puraane log or congress party ke netaa pachaa nahin paae
 By then Lalit was being touted as anti-congress and pro-bjp
 lalit modi baahar se twit kar rahe hai ki mere kilaaf arun jetali, ahamed patel or rajeev shukla kii tikdi jamaa ho gai he
 Lalit Modi has tweeted another that it seems that a channel has released documents by paying money
 vasundhara ne yah halafanama lalit modi ko landan kii residency lene ke liye diya tha
 When the Enforcement Directorate of India was searching for Lalit Modi
 kya ab bhi bijepi yaa modi sarkaar vasundhara raaje kaa bachaav kar sakegi
 Congress also did not delay
 thik vaisaa hi kiya jaisaa koyala or kaamanwealth ghotaale ke samay hota tha
 BJP used to hold birat press conference at night
 ab congress kar rahi he or istipha maang rahi he
 Resignation is in demand
 rajnath kehete hai ki ye upie nahin he endie he
 There is no resignation
 aaj dilli kii ek adaalat ne halafname main maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kii degree kii jaankaree ke bare main yachika sweekaar kar lee
 The petition was accepted but the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress immediately demanded the resignation of Smriti Irani
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kii degree kaa vivaad jail jail gum rahe aam aadmi party ke vidhayak jitendra singh tomars ke pakade jane se pehle kaa he
 But the way Jitendra Singh Tomar was arrested, the reference to the case of fake degree or disputed degree is changing
 maharashtra se bhi ek mantri kii degree vivaadon main he
 Smriti Irani, while contesting the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, stated in her affidavit that she passed her BA from the correspondence school of Delhi University in 1996, contested the Rajya Sabha elections in 2011 and said BA Commerce Part One
 2014 ke halafname main kaha ki dilli vishvavidhyalay ke skool of open larning se bikom part van kiya he
 The Patiala House court of Delhi has approved the hearing on this matter
 28 agast ko sunwaayee hogi, sunwaayee kai din chal sakati he, yah na samajhiye ki us din faisla aane vaala he
 Importantly, even after the 2004 case, the court did not consider it outdated and accepted for hearing
 isliye ab saman dene ke pehle kii sunwaayee hogi jisamen aarope lagane vaale ko hi saare saboot laakar sabit karnaa hoga
 After that Smriti Irani will have to appear in the trial
 dhyaan rahe adaalat ne sirf aaropee ko saboot laakar sabit karne ke liye kaha he
 Has not given any decision
 26 may ko kendriya mantri ke rup main shapath lene se 16 din pehle supreme court ne maharashtra ke maamle main ek faisla diya tha
 Thane district MLA Kishan Shankar Kathore, in his October 2004 affidavit, did not provide details of the outstanding electricity bill, bungalow and share in wife's name
 kathore sahab pehle hoicourt main haare phir supreme court main
 His membership was gone
 faisla internet par kishal shankar kathore banaam dattatreya saavant ke naam se maujuud he
 The Supreme Court said that in such cases, when it is proved that information was not given or incorrect information was given or complete information was not given, it would be presumed that the nomination was not accepted correctly
 chunaav ayog kii taraf se bahes karte hue minakshi aroda ne sahi kaha he ki aisi jaanch to baad main hi sakati he
 If it is found out earlier that the wrong information is given in the affidavit, then he cannot contest the election, so if he finds out later, his election can be canceled
 yahaan tak ki namakan bharte samay halafname main jaankaree nahin dene or khaali sthaan chhod dene ke bare main supreme court kaa ek faisla he
 In the 2013 case of Resurgence India v
 Election Commission, a decision was given that membership could be allowed if left vacant
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 2012 ke vidhansabha main die gaye halafname ke bare main yahi aarope tha ki vahaan vivaahit kollam nahin bharaa gaya tha
 Married was written in a 2014 affidavit
 yah maamla gujarat hai court main chal rahaa he
 Now the BJP gives the example of Sonia Gandhi in this regard
 11 april 2005 kii ek report he hindu akhbaar kii
 The Supreme Court dismissed Subramanian Swamy's petition

 Lalit Modi has tweeted another that it seems that a channel has released documents by paying money
 istipha demand main he
 Rajnath says that it is not UPA, it is NDA
 istipha nahin hota he
 Today, a Delhi court accepted the plea regarding information about the degree of HRD Minister Smriti Irani in the affidavit
 yachika hi sweekaar kii lekin aam aadmi party or congress ne turant smriti irani se istipha maang diya
 The controversy over the degree of Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani precedes the arrest of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Jitendra Singh Tomar, who is roaming the jail
 lekin jis tarah se jitendra singh tomars kii giraftaar hui, farzi degree yaa vivaadit degree ke maamle kaa sandarbh badalata ja rahaa he
 The degree of a minister from Maharashtra is also in dispute
 2004 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladate vakt smriti irani ne apane halafname main bataaya ki unhone 1996 main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke patrachaar vidhyalay se bie paas kiya he, 2011 main rajyasabha kaa chunaav ladiin to bie commers part van bataaya
 The 2014 affidavit stated that he has done b
com Part One from the School of Open Learning of Delhi University
 dilli kii patiala house adaalat ne is maamle par sunwaayee kii manzuri de di he
 There will be a hearing on August 28, the hearing may go on for several days, do not think that the decision will come on that day
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki 2004 kaa maamla hone ke baad bhi adaalat ne ise purana nahin mana or sunwaayee ke liye sweekaar kar liya
 Therefore, before the summons, there will be a hearing in which only the accused has to prove it by bringing all the evidence
 uske baad smriti irani ko trial main pesh hona padegaa
 Keep in mind the court has only asked the accused to prove it by bringing evidence
 kisi tarah kaa koi faisla nahin diya he
 On May 26, 16 days before he was sworn in as Union Minister, the Supreme Court gave a verdict in the Maharashtra case
 thane zile ke vidhayak kishan shankar kathore ne oktober 2004 ke apane halfmane main bakaayaa bijli bill, patni ke naam bangala or share kii jaankaree nahin di
 Mr
 Kathore lost first in the High Court and then in the Supreme Court
 unki sadsyta chali gai
 The verdict exists on the Internet in the name of Kishal Shankar Kathore vs Dattatreya Sawant
 supreme court ne kaha ki aise maamalon main jab yah sabit ho jaataa he ki jaankaree nahin di gai yaa galat jaankaree di gai yaa puri jaankaree nahin di to mana jayega ki namakan sahi tareeke se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 While arguing on behalf of the Election Commission, Meenakshi Arora has rightly said that such an inquiry can only be done later
 agar pehle pataa chal jaataa he ki halafname main galat jaankaree di he to wo chunaav nahin lard saktaa is lihaaz se agar baad main pataa chalata he to uskaa chunaav radd ho saktaa he
 Even at the time of filing nomination, there is a decision of the Supreme Court about not giving information in the affidavit and leaving a blank space
 2013 ke risergence india banaam chunaav ayog maamle main faisla diya gaya tha ki khaali sthaan chhodane par sadsyta ja sakati he
 The same allegation about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's affidavit in the 2012 Assembly was that the married column was not filled there

 This case is going on in the Gujarat High Court

 swami ke anusaar 2004 main sonia gandhi ne apni shaikshanik yogyata ke bare main galat jaankaree di thi
 The two-judge bench had said that Sonia Gandhi did not hide information that she had done a certificate course in English from the Lenox Cook School of Cambridges University

 He made many unwarranted allegations of corruption on both of us during my Chief Minister's term
 lekin tab tak lalit modi kaa naam bharat ke ghar ghar main mashhoor ho chukaa tha balki duniya kaa khel jagat jaanane laga tha
 After the great success of IPL, Lalit's success was not digested by the old people of the cricket world and the leaders of the Congress Party

 One such step has been taken by Indo Tibet Border Police (ITBP) in Abujhmad area of chhattisgarh

 ITBP is teaching youths the stakes of judo, karate and taekwondo at the Self Defense Training Camp in Kodagaon, Abujhmad
 bataa den ki abujhmadnaksalwadase prabhavit sabase khatarnaak ilaakon main se ek mana jaataa he
 In fact, the central government's motive behind this exercise initiated by ITBP is that the youth who are involved in Naxal incidents under pressure from the Naxalites in the tribal area, can take the help of Self Defense Training to protect themselves

 lekin ab yahaan par kendriya ardhsainik balon kii har vakt mustaidi kii vajah senksaliyonke liye is kshetra main paith bananaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pointed out that there are 112 districts in the country where the benefit of development did not reach the way it should have reached

 duusari taraf congress or duusari vipakshi partiyon kaa kahana he ki 40 lakh logon ko baahar kar dene vaale draft enarasi main khamiyaan hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee believes that this is a conspiracy of the BJP

 "he invited 40 lakh people who were out of draft NRC to take refuge in his state
" bhaajapa ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki bengal main bhi isi tarah karodon ghuspaithiyon ko baahar kar diya jayega
 In 2005, Banerjee herself threw her papers to the Lok Sabha Speaker, angered by not being allowed to raise the issue of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the Lok Sabha

 But the percentage of people excluded is higher in Assamese dominated districts like Dibrugarh, or tribal dominated districts like Karbi Anglong
 ’’enarasi ko lekar congress kii pratikriya puri tarah asamanjas bhari he
 The Congress is saying that the BJP is adopting a 'divide and rule' policy in the state, giving some shocking examples such as the exclusion of the nephew of former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed from the NRC
 is bich assam ke purv mukhyamantri or congress ke diggaj netaa tarun gogoi kaa kahana he ki enarasi kaa idia unka tha jabaki party adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa kahana he ki ‘‘assam samjhaute (1985) ke vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye upie ne enarasi kii pahal kii thi
 But the way the BJP government has done this is unsatisfactory
 ’’lekin assam main congress kii is baat par kam hi log yakeen kar rahe hai
 Most people say that the situation was out of control due to the 'politics of appeasement' of the Congress

 In 2016, the BJP wanted to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to provide citizenship to these illegal migrants
 agar ye sanshodhan paarit ho jate hai to bangladesh se aakar assam main basane vaale avaidh pravaasiyon, jinhen enarasi main jagah nahin mili he, ko naagarikta mil jaaegi
 The BJP says that these amendments will protect the Hindu identity of Assam, but it has probably forgotten the real issue of Assamese identity
 assam ke logon main bengali hinduon kii samskruti ke dabadabe ko lekar ek dar baitha hua he
 Due to the protests, these amendments were put on hold but will the BJP revive it once the NRC is published later this year? There is a possibility that the Bill will be brought back

 Those who are out can file their claim and their objections again from 30 August to 28 September
 antim enarasi suchi se bhi baahar hone vaale avaidh pravaasiyon kaa kya hoga? unhen waapas bhejnaa asambhav he
 Then what rights will these citizenshipless people have? Will they be allowed to buy property? What will happen to them if they have already purchased the assets? Will they get benefit of welfare schemes of the government? What will happen to the children born to them after the publication of NRC? As far as voting rights are concerned, the Ministry of Home Affairs has said that its decision will be taken by the Election Commission

 The current NRC made its cutoff in March 1971
 is prakaar us saal se pehle assam main aane vaale ‘avaidh’ pravaasiyon ko maafee de di gai he
 Motiur Rahman of the Assam Consolidated Federation filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging this, claiming that the granting of citizenship to migrants from Assam prior to 1971 threatened the survival of the original inhabitants

Now the advocates of the judiciary not interfering in the internal affairs have this question The answer is no, who opened the doors to outsiders?

 bijepi ke varisht netaa tarun vijay ne kaha he kipradhanmantri narendra modi ne videsh nitike maamle main apane aalochakon ko galat sabit kiya he
 Especially those who feared Modi's inexperience on this important national security front
 bijepi ke netaa tarun vijay ne kal washington main kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ne ek saal se bhi kam samay main bharat ke uske padosi deshon se sambandh sudhaare, bharat or america ke sambandhon ko teji se majboot kiya, hind mahaasaagar ke deshon se sampark sthapit kiya, act east asia kii nai niti viksit kii or vaishvik netaaon ke dil or dimag ko jeeta
 Vijay, who went to the US to attend the annual spring meeting of the IMF and World Bank, said that all the doubts and doubts related to Modi's foreign policy have been proved wrong
 rajyasabha sadsy vijay ne kaha ki modi ke netritv main pehali baar videsh niti ne gharelu niti, rashtriya ranneetik or suraksha hiton kii jarurat puri kii he
 He said that the government has continued talks with Pakistan despite much provocation
 anya padosi deshon bhutan, nepal or srilanka ke saath bhi sambandh pehle se behatar hue hai

 25 july ko pranab mukherjee ke raashtrapati pad kii shapath ke saath hi shuru ho jaaegi unki ‘guru’ pariksha
 The case of Afzal Guru, who has been in discussion for years, will be on the table of Pranab Mukherjee as soon as he becomes President
 khaas baat ye he ki bal thakare or khud pranab da ke bete abhijit mukherjee ne is maamle main faisla lene kii pranab se apil kii he
 Afzal Guru has been hanged from the Supreme Court in the Parliament attack
 lekin uski faansee kaa maamla abhi tak lataka hua he
 However, the case of Afzal Guru is again in the news once Pranab Mukherjee is elected President
 pranab mukherjee ko badhai dene aae unke bete abhijit ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki afjal kii faansee par jald faisla liya janaa chahie
 Earlier, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, who supported Pranab for the presidency, fired the first bomb
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main bal thakare ne pranab mukherjee ko jeet kii badhai di he
 But at the same time, the demand for hanging Afzal Guru has been repeated
 saamana main bal thakare ne likhaa he ki afjal guru kii dayaa yachika ko pranab mukherjee khaarij karen or afjal guru ko faansee kii sajaa den
 Shiv Sena had earlier demanded that Afzal Guru be hanged
 lekin pranab da ko samarthan die jane ke chalate is baar dabaav zyada he
 The special thing is that Pranab Mukherjee's son himself has also said that the decision to hang Afzal Guru should not be hanged
 yani pranab mukherjee ke raashtrapati banane se pehle hi afjal guru kii faansee kaa sawaal sir uthaae khadaa he
 While the Congress has already made its stand clear on the matter
 isiilie grih mantralay ne sansad hamale ke afjal guru kii faansee kii sajaa maaf karne kii apil raashtrapati se kar rakhi he
 It is clear that before taking oath, the crisis is in front of the troubleshooter Pranab da
 wo bhi aisa sankat, jisase do-do raashtrapati bachate-bachaate rahe
 Now Pranab Mukherjee will keep an eye on which Sanjeevani booti will bring to tackle this crisis
 dilli main siver main hone vaali mauton se safai karmchaariyon ko bachaane ke liye kejariwal sarkaar training de rahi he
 CM Kejriwal has announced to provide security kit by the government to every government and private sweeper

 Thousands of sanitation workers were present at the Talkatora Stadium for training
 siver main utarane se pehle kin-kin upkarnon kaa kaise istemaal karnaa he iske bare main ek video bhi safai karmchaariyon ko dikhaaya gaya
 During the program, Chief Minister Kejriwal also mentioned the increasing population of Delhi
 unhone kaha, 'kai kaarnon se log dilli main aate hai, or yahaan aakar bas jate hai
 But Delhi's population is growing rapidly
 badhati aabaadi ke saath sadak, naalee or khadnje banane kaa kaam nahin kiya gaya
 Our first priority is that every household gets tap water
 kai ilaake aise hai jahaan 2 din main 1 ghante pani aata he
 Our effort is to get drinking water in 24 hours tap and people without RO can drink water
 'aage kejariwal ne kaha, 'aaj saadhe 4 saal ke baad 80% dilli main siver kii line bichaai gai he
 There is a plan to provide sewer to 100% of Delhi's houses in the coming 2 years
 jab shahar badhata he to wo shahar garib ke liye khyaal nahin rakh paata he
 Our government wants everyone to develop together
 siver main maut ho jaae to dukh hota he, ise khatm karnaa hoga
 Delhi Jal Board is doing its best
 'iske alaava arvind kejariwal ne aam aadmi party ko dilli main sabase zyada siten milane ke peeche garibon ko badi vajah bataaya
 He said that we got 67 seats out of 70 because of the poor
 iske baad hamane garibon kii mazdooree badhaai lekin ab mazdooron ko khud kii suraksha kerani hogi
 The responsibility of the cleaning staff will remain with the contractor, but now the Delhi government will give a safety kit to the sweeper for free
 kai baar safai karmchaaree laaparvaahee kar jate hai
 Today the sweepers swear that they will not enter the sewer without a safety kit
 aapako bataa den ki dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar siver kii safai ke liye mashine bhi laanch kar chuki he, taaki karmchaariyon ko siver main hone vaali maut se bachaaya ja sake
 In such a situation, questions are also raised on the motive of distributing the kit to the cleaning workers
 haalanki dilli jal board kaa maananaa he ki kai jagahon par mashine pahunch paanaa mushkil hota he aise main sarkari or privet karmchaariyon ko training dena zaruri he

 '' Housefull 4 Movie Review: akshay kumaar, bobi deol, ritesh deshmukh, kriti sinan, kriti kharbanda, puja hegade, chanki pandeya or dher saare sitaron ke baavjood 'housephul 4' 'bada packet chota dhamal' nikalati he
 The story of 'housefull 4' dates back to 1419 in Sitamgarh, where Akshay, Bobby, Ritesh, Kriti, Pooja and Kriti love each other, but for some reason the two part ways
 chah sau saal baad teenon jode punarjanm lete hai, or iske baad phir shuru hoti he, housephul tip kanfusion
 Miss match of Couples and many cameos one after the other
 kul milakar housephul 4 ko pehle teen part kii tarj par hi gadhane kii koshish kii gai he
 The story is very weak
 jabardastee ke jokes thunse gaye hai, or kai jagah to hansi bhi nahin aati he
 Dialogues are very pale
 'housephul 4' main acting kii baat karen to film main dher saare actor hai or kai to itane betuke hai ki samaj hi nahin aata unhen kyon daalaa gaya he
 Akshay Kumar, as usual, seems to be much louder in acting
 ritesh deshmukh ko bhi is tarah ke kirdaar main dekha ja chukaa he
 The rest of the actors of the film also do not do anything special
 kul milakar ek kamjor or betuki kahani ke aadhaar par sitaron kii fouj ko khadaa kiya gaya he jis vajah se film kii neenv charmarati najar aati he
 There is no actor of the film who leaves his mark on the heart or mind
 'housephul 4' ke diarection kii baat karen to farhaad saamaji ne film ko behad kamjor or puraane concept par khadaa karne kii koshish kii he
 There is nothing in the name of the story in the film
 'housephul 4' kaa 'bala' song jarur acha he, lekin baaki gane everej hai
 Comedy films are often released on the occasion of Diwali, this time "housefull 4" has arrived, but the comedy, story and acting fail to illuminate the film like Diwali on all three sides
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 75 karod rupee bataaya ja rahaa he, lekin diwaali kaa weekend hone kii vajah se 'housephul 4' ko acchhee opening mil sakati he, lekin iskaa baaki kaa safar sangharsh bharaa rah saktaa he

 But can the employees of a jewelery shop be so happy because of this that they can dance happily, because there are no customers in the shop? What is a video is going viral on Davasoshal Media
 jisamen ek jewelery shop main karmchaaree dance kar rahe hai
 With this video, it is being claimed that there are no customers in the shop due to rising gold prices, so the employees of the shop are passing the time in this way
 kai phase book yugers jaise “different Things” or “rama Kulkarni” aadi ne is video ko post kiya he
 The caption accompanying the video reads, "gold costs Rs 40,000, no customers
 isliye karmchaaree time paas kar rahe hai”
 What is truthindia Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this claim is false
 jewelery kii dukaan main karmchaaree isliye dance nahin kar rahe hai kyonki sona mahangaa hone ke chalate graahak nahin hai or ve time paas kar rahe hai
 The video is a year old and belongs to a Delhi-based jewelery shop
 is jewelery shop main yah niyamit rivaaj he ki yahaan ke karmchaaree roj din kii shuruyaat gane or dance ke saath karte hai taaki unka din khushhaal ho sake
 How we came to know this video is also viral on whatsapp and Twitter along with Facebook
 do minute ke is video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ek jewelery shop main kuch aadmi or auraten offis uniform main ek gane par dance kar rahe hai or yah gaanaa hindi main nahin he
 Many people on Twitter have expressed curiosity about the song playing in the background
 kuch ne likhaa ki yah ek mashhoor “pahari” gaanaa he jiske bol hai “chaita ki chaitwal” or yah khaskar uttarakhand main lokapriy he
 We found that this song is really "chaita ki chaitwal" which is in Garhwali language and is present on youtube
 kuch or logon ne coment karke likhaa he ki yah tanishk jewelery kaa koi store ho saktaa he
 We searched through the key word “chaiti ki Chaitwal Uttarakhand Tanishq” and we found two similar videos on youtube
 kis jewelery shop kaa he videoutubar “uttarakhand Pahari Video online” or “garwal villager Praveen Singh Panwar” ne yah video 18 sitambar, 2018 ko utyub par aplod kiya he
 Both claimed in the caption of the video that the video is from Tanishq's showroom in Connaught Place, Delhi
 hamane conot place sthit tanishk ke showrooms main sampark kiya
 He dismissed the claim that the video was from Tanishq's showroom
 unka kahana tha ki “video main karmchaariyon ne jo uniform pahana he vah tanishk kaa nahin he
 "so this video cannot be from any Tanishq showroom
 unhone hame sanket diya ki yah video ek anya mashhoor jewelery brands “manohar laal jewalers” kaa ho saktaa he
 We found the same video of Manohar Lal Jewelers on Facebook
 yah video unhone haal hi main apane fasebuk pej par post karke apane karmchaariyon ke “morning routine” ke is rivaaj ke bare main vistaar se bataaya he
 The office of Manohar Lal Jewelers told us on the phone that the video going viral was shot in his shop
 lekin yah daawa puri tarah galat he ki sone ke daam badhane se graahak sona kharidne nahin aa rahe hai, isliye karmchaaree time paas ke liye dance kar rahe hai
 According to Manohan Lal Jewelers, it is a routine of every day in our shop that we start the day off happily with songs and dance
 yah video pichley saal sitambar main dilli ke preet vihaar sthit manohar laal jewalers ke store main shoot kiya gaya tha
 Conclusion According to Media Keyport, the price of gold has increased from 30,000 to 40,000 in the last 12 months
 sone kii keemat main is badhottaree ne sone kii bikri ko prabhavit kiya he
 But the claim being made with the viral video is completely false
 jewelery store main dance kar rahe karmchaariyon kaa video purana he or iskaa sone kii badi keemton se koi lenaa dena nahin he

 Agriculture, animal husbandry, irrigation are included
 abhimanyu or dhanakad ko khatter mantrimandal main kaaphi mahatvapurn jagah mili hui he
 Nevertheless their houses were attacked
 thik usee tarah jaise gujarat main patel aarakshan ke samay patel mantriyon ke ghar par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 It was now said that Rohtak was burnt because it was identified as the capital of Jat politics
 ek baar phir se rohtak ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekh lete hai
 There are 9 assembly seats in Rohtak
 maham, gadhi-saanpala-kiloi, rohtak, kalanur, bahadurgard, badali, jhajjar, beri, kosli
 Four of these are with BJP and 5 with Congress
 maujuuda 9 main se chaar vidhayak jat hai
 There are one Brahmin, one Punjabi and two Dalits, one Yadav
 2009 main rohtak zile main chaar jat the
 In 2009, the Congress had 9 seats out of 9
 rohtak loksabhaa kii seat deependra hooda ke paas he jo jat hai
 Is anyone trying to create a polarization of non-jat versus Jat on the ground
 haryana main jo kuch hua kya uskaa sambandh sirf aarakshan kii maang se tha yaa jat shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa bhi tha
 The polarization between Jat vs non Jat was to be strengthened
 aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patelon ne bhi khub andolan kiya lekin vahaan chand hafton main police ne kaabo kar liya
 Hardik Patel has been charged with sedition against the police for inciting people and causing damage to properties and has been in jail for a long time
 lekin jat samudaay kii ugrata kii pravriti alag maani jaati he
 Seeing the intensity of the Jat movement, the BJP and the central government swung into action
 haryana main punjabi or saini samaaj ke gharon or dukaanon par kaaphi hamalaa hua he
 The political distance between the two communities will increase, who will benefit from this, it should also be considered
 kya congress isse apni vaapasi kaa rasta dekh rahi he yaa bijepi apane aadhaar ko majboot kar rahi he lekin bijepi apni hi sarkaar vaale rajya main ye sab kyon karegi
 BJP MP Rajkumar Saini is said to have been continuously attacking the Jat fraternity
 kai log jaaton ko ek raajnneetik samudaay ke rup main dekhne ke aadi hai
 However, it is not like that
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti ke kaaran jat badi sankhya main bijepi ke saath aae to haryana main jaaton ke kilaaf gair jat dhruvikaran kii baat hone lagi he
 In view of Haryana's Jat reservation, voices have also started coming from Rajasthan and western UP
 agar iske naam par golbandi hui to bijepi ke liye mushkil ho sakati he
 Perhaps that is why the BJP did not delay the formation of a committee from assurance on Jat reservation
 bijepi ne vaada kar diya ki vidhansabha ke agle hi satr main jaaton ko aarakshan de diya jayega
 BJP President Amit Shah has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of Venkaya Naidu which will find its way out of the Supreme Court
 congress sarkaar ne jaaton ko obisi kaa darja diya tha magar court ne use khaarij kar diya
 It is also being said that 27 per cent of the BJP OBC reservation can be given out
 haryana ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki jaaton ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya ja saktaa he lekin jat netaaon ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh also called and talked to Jat leaders of many states and appealed for the most peace
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki yah ek jatil masalaa he ham baatcheet se hal karenge
 We have formed committees
 sabase charchaa karenge uske baad hi faisla le sakate hai
 Today the first meeting of that committee was also held
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne khabar di he ki sarkaar kai vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi he
 Theoretically, reservation has been agreed, but how it will be given is being discussed
 pehla vikalp he ki unhen BC(B) catagori ke tahat aarakshan diya jaae jo krishak samudaayon ke liye he
 Under this, there is a provision of 11 percent reservation
 doosraa vikalp he haryana main 3 pratishat khaali kota jaaton ko diya jaae
 For this the consent of all parties will be obtained
 jab tak jaaton ko rajya main aarakshan nahin milegaa, centre main nahin milegaa
 Therefore, the bill will be introduced in the Haryana Legislative Assembly in the third week of March

 In March 2014, the UPA government issued a notification just before the general elections and decided to give OBC status to Jats
 iske tahat uttar bharat ke nau rajyon ke jat samudaay ke logon ko phayda hona tha
 On March 17, 2015, the Supreme Court rejected the notification related to giving OBC status to Jats
 isi maheene 16 farvari ko supreme court ne notification khaarij karne ke apane faisale ke punarvichaar se judi yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 On 26 March 2015, last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met representatives of Khap panchayats and Jat leaders and supported their demand for OBC reservation
 lekin jab is aashwaasan par koi karrwai nahin hui to akhil bhartiya jat aarakshan sangharsh samiti (AIJASS) ne aarakshan ke liye apana andolan phir shuru kar diya

 rajya main jaaton kaa pratishat 27-28 bataaya jaataa he
 Of the 90 assembly seats in Haryana, BJP currently has 47, 19 are with INLD and Congress has 15 mlas

 Captain Abhimanyu and Om Prakash Dhankad
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh bhi jat hai subhash barwaala
 The BJP has six Jat mlas
 haryana congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar dalit hai
 The Congress has 11 Jat mlas
 yani jat vidhayak zyada congress ke paas he
 This is the first time in Haryana that Jat mlas are more in opposition or else there were more Jat mlas in the ruling party
 bijepi ke paas 6 jat vidhayak hai to congress ke paas 11
 At the time when Om Prakash Chautala was the Chief Minister, the number of Jat mlas increased to 30
 devilal ke samay 24 hi thi
 The previous assembly had 27–28 Jats
 is baar kii vidhansabha main 26 ke kareeb hai
 There has not been much difference in terms of numbers, but most Jats have come in opposition

 It is also said that bjp's Jat mlas win with the support of non-jats
 lekin bijepi ke donon jat mantri kaaphi taqatvar hai
 Captain Abhimanyu has 12 departments including Finance, Revenue, Planning Environment and Industry

 Just as the Patel ministers' house was attacked during the Patel Reservation in Gujarat
 ab ye kaha gaya ki rohtak ko jala diya gaya kyonki jat raajnneeti kii rajdhani ke rup main uski pahchaan thi
 Let's once again look at Rohtak's political equation
 rohtak main vidhansabha kii 9 siten hai
 Maham, garhi-sampla-kiloi, Rohtak, Kalanaur, Bahadurgarh, Badli, Jhajjar, Beri, Kosli
 inamen se chaar bijepi ke paas hai or 5 congress ke paas
 Four of the current 9 mlas are Jats
 ek brahman, ek punjabi or do dalit hai, ek yadav hai
 In 2009 there were four Jats in Rohtak district
 2009 main 9 kii 9 siten congress ke paas thim
 Rohtak Lok Sabha seat is held by Deepender Hooda, who is a Jat
 kya zamin par koi gaiyr jat banaam jat kaa dhruvikaran banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 What happened in Haryana was related only to the demand for reservation or to demonstrate Jat power
 jat banaam gaiyr jat ke bich dhruvikaran ko majboot karnaa tha
 There was a lot of agitation by the Patels to demand reservation, but within a few weeks the police took control
 hardik patel par police ke khilaaf logon ko uksaane or sampattiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope main rajdroh kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya gaya or wo kaaphi samay se jail main he
 But the Jat community's tendency towards extremism is considered different
 jat andolan kii tivrata ko dekhte hi bijepi or centre sarkaar harakat main aa gai
 The houses and shops of Punjabi and Saini Samaj have been severely attacked in Haryana
 isse donon samudaayon ke bich kii jo raajnneetik duuri badhegi uskaa laabh kis kis ko hoga is par bhi sochaa janaa chahie
 Is the Congress looking for a comeback from this or is the BJP strengthening its base, but why would the BJP do all this in its own state
 bijepi ke saansad rajkumaar saini ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve lagaataar jat birdari par hamale kar rahe the
 Many people are accustomed to seeing Jats as a political community
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Due to the politics of polarization in western Uttar Pradesh, Jats joined the BJP in large numbers, and in Haryana, there has been talk of non-jat polarization against Jats
 haryana ke jat aarakshan ko dekhte hue rajasthan or pashchimi upi se bhi awaazen aane lagi hai
 If there is a mobilization in its name, it may be difficult for the BJP
 shaayad isiilie bijepi ne jat aarakshan ko lekar aashwaasan se lekar cameti banane main koi deree nahin kii
 The BJP promised that Jats would be given reservation in the very next session of the assembly
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi venkaya naidu kii adhyakshata main ek cameti bana di he jo supreme court se khaarij na ho sake iskaa rasta nikaalegi
 Jats were given OBC status by the Congress government but the court rejected it
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi obisi ke 27 fisadi aarakshan se baahar diya ja saktaa he
 The Chief Minister of Haryana has said that Jats can be given reservation on economic grounds, but the Jat leaders rejected the proposal
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne bhi kai rajyon ke jat netaaon ko bulaakar baat kii or sabase shanti kii apil kii he
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that this is a complex issue that we will resolve by negotiation
 hamane cameti banaai hai

 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has reported that the government is considering several options
 saidhantik rup se aarakshan dene ko taiyaar ho gai he lekin kaise diya jayega us par baat ho rahi he
 The first option is to give them reservation under BC (B) category which is for the farming communities
 iske tahat 11 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 Another option is to give 3 percent vacant quota to Jats in Haryana
 iske liye sabhi dalon kii sahmati hasil kii jaaegi
 Till the Jats do not get reservation in the state, they will not get it at the center
 isliye march ke tisare hafte main haryana vidhansabha main bill laayaa jayega

 It consisted of 70 representatives from different states

 The government is currently reading the decision of the Supreme Court and will try to find a solution under the legal framework

 They do not feel safe here
 yani jat vidhayak zyada congress ke paas he
 This is the first time in Haryana that Jat mlas are more in opposition or else there were more Jat mlas in the ruling party
 bijepi ke paas 6 jat vidhayak hai to congress ke paas 11
 At the time when Om Prakash Chautala was the Chief Minister, the number of Jat mlas increased to 30
 devilal ke samay 24 hi thi
 The previous assembly had 27–28 Jats
 is baar kii vidhansabha main 26 ke kareeb hai
 Of numbers not been much difference terms of but most Jats have come in opposition
 shaayad satta ke jane kaa dard is segment main zyada mahasoos kiya ja rahaa ho
 It is also said that bjp's Jat mlas win with the support of non-jats
 lekin bijepi ke donon jat mantri kaaphi taqatvar hai
 Captain Abhimanyu has 12 departments including Finance, Revenue, Planning Environment and Industry

 Nevertheless their houses were attacked
 thik usee tarah jaise gujarat main patel aarakshan ke samay patel mantriyon ke ghar par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 It was now said that Rohtak was burnt because it was identified as the capital of Jat politics
 ek baar phir se rohtak ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekh lete hai
 There are 9 assembly seats in Rohtak
 maham, gadhi-saanpala-kiloi, rohtak, kalanur, bahadurgard, badali, jhajjar, beri, kosli
 Four of these are with BJP and 5 with Congress
 maujuuda 9 main se chaar vidhayak jat hai
 There are one Brahmin, one Punjabi and two Dalits, one Yadav
 2009 main rohtak zile main chaar jat the
 In 2009, the Congress had 9 seats out of 9
 rohtak loksabhaa kii seat deependra hooda ke paas he jo jat hai
 Is anyone trying to create a polarization of non-jat versus Jat on the ground
 haryana main jo kuch hua kya uskaa sambandh sirf aarakshan kii maang se tha yaa jat shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa bhi tha
 The polarization between Jat vs non Jat was to be strengthened
 aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patelon ne bhi khub andolan kiya lekin vahaan chand hafton main police ne kaabo kar liya
 Hardik Patel has been charged with sedition against the police for inciting people and causing damage to properties and has been in jail for a long time
 lekin jat samudaay kii ugrata kii pravriti alag maani jaati he
 Seeing the intensity of the Jat movement, the BJP and the central government swung into action
 haryana main punjabi or saini samaaj ke gharon or dukaanon par kaaphi hamalaa hua he
 The political distance between the two communities will increase, who will benefit from this, it should also be considered
 kya congress isse apni vaapasi kaa rasta dekh rahi he yaa bijepi apane aadhaar ko majboot kar rahi he lekin bijepi apni hi sarkaar vaale rajya main ye sab kyon karegi
 BJP MP Rajkumar Saini is said to have been continuously attacking the Jat fraternity
 kai log jaaton ko ek raajnneetik samudaay ke rup main dekhne ke aadi hai
 However, it is not like that
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti ke kaaran jat badi sankhya main bijepi ke saath aae to haryana main jaaton ke kilaaf gair jat dhruvikaran kii baat hone lagi he
 In view of Haryana's Jat reservation, voices have also started coming from Rajasthan and western UP
 agar iske naam par golbandi hui to bijepi ke liye mushkil ho sakati he
 Perhaps that is why the BJP did not delay the formation of a committee from assurance on Jat reservation
 bijepi ne vaada kar diya ki vidhansabha ke agle hi satr main jaaton ko aarakshan de diya jayega
 BJP President Amit Shah has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of Venkaya Naidu which will find its way out of the Supreme Court
 congress sarkaar ne jaaton ko obisi kaa darja diya tha magar court ne use khaarij kar diya
 It is also being said that 27 per cent of the BJP OBC reservation can be given out
 haryana ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki jaaton ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya ja saktaa he lekin jat netaaon ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh also called and talked to Jat leaders of many states and appealed for the most peace
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki yah ek jatil masalaa he ham baatcheet se hal karenge

 Today the first meeting of that committee was also held
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne khabar di he ki sarkaar kai vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi he
 Theoretically, reservation has been agreed, but how it will be given is being discussed
 pehla vikalp he ki unhen BC(B) catagori ke tahat aarakshan diya jaae jo krishak samudaayon ke liye he
 Under this, there is a provision of 11 percent reservation
 doosraa vikalp he haryana main 3 pratishat khaali kota jaaton ko diya jaae
 For this the consent of all parties will be obtained
 jab tak jaaton ko rajya main aarakshan nahin milegaa, centre main nahin milegaa

 Abhimanyu and Dhankad hold a very important place in the Khattar cabinet

 Just as the Patel ministers' house was attacked during the Patel Reservation in Gujarat
 ab ye kaha gaya ki rohtak ko jala diya gaya kyonki jat raajnneeti kii rajdhani ke rup main uski pahchaan thi
 Let's once again look at Rohtak's political equation
 rohtak main vidhansabha kii 9 siten hai
 Maham, garhi-sampla-kiloi, Rohtak, Kalanaur, Bahadurgarh, Badli, Jhajjar, Beri, Kosli
 inamen se chaar bijepi ke paas hai or 5 congress ke paas
 Four of the current 9 mlas are Jats
 ek brahman, ek punjabi or do dalit hai, ek yadav hai
 In 2009 there were four Jats in Rohtak district
 2009 main 9 kii 9 siten congress ke paas thim
 Rohtak Lok Sabha seat is held by Deepender Hooda, who is a Jat
 kya zamin par koi gaiyr jat banaam jat kaa dhruvikaran banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 What happened in Haryana was related only to the demand for reservation or to demonstrate Jat power
 jat banaam gaiyr jat ke bich dhruvikaran ko majboot karnaa tha
 There was a lot of agitation by the Patels to demand reservation, but within a few weeks the police took control
 hardik patel par police ke khilaaf logon ko uksaane or sampattiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope main rajdroh kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya gaya or wo kaaphi samay se jail main he
 But the Jat community's tendency towards extremism is considered different
 jat andolan kii tivrata ko dekhte hi bijepi or centre sarkaar harakat main aa gai
 The houses and shops of Punjabi and Saini Samaj have been severely attacked in Haryana
 isse donon samudaayon ke bich kii jo raajnneetik duuri badhegi uskaa laabh kis kis ko hoga is par bhi sochaa janaa chahie
 Is the Congress looking for a comeback from this or is the BJP strengthening its base, but why would the BJP do all this in its own state
 bijepi ke saansad rajkumaar saini ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve lagaataar jat birdari par hamale kar rahe the
 Many people are accustomed to seeing Jats as a political community
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Due to the politics of polarization in western Uttar Pradesh, Jats joined the BJP in large numbers, and in Haryana, there has been talk of non-jat polarization against Jats
 haryana ke jat aarakshan ko dekhte hue rajasthan or pashchimi upi se bhi awaazen aane lagi hai
 If there is a mobilization in its name, it may be difficult for the BJP
 shaayad isiilie bijepi ne jat aarakshan ko lekar aashwaasan se lekar cameti banane main koi deree nahin kii
 The BJP promised that Jats would be given reservation in the very next session of the assembly
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi venkaya naidu kii adhyakshata main ek cameti bana di he jo supreme court se khaarij na ho sake iskaa rasta nikaalegi
 Jats were given OBC status by the Congress government but the court rejected it
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi obisi ke 27 fisadi aarakshan se baahar diya ja saktaa he
 The Chief Minister of Haryana has said that Jats can be given reservation on economic grounds, but the Jat leaders rejected the proposal
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne bhi kai rajyon ke jat netaaon ko bulaakar baat kii or sabase shanti kii apil kii he
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that this is a complex issue that we will resolve by negotiation
 hamane cameti banaai hai
 Most will discuss only then they can decide
 aaj us cameti kii pehali baithak bhi hui
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has reported that the government is considering several options
 saidhantik rup se aarakshan dene ko taiyaar ho gai he lekin kaise diya jayega us par baat ho rahi he
 The first option is to give them reservation under BC (B) category which is for the farming communities
 iske tahat 11 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 Another option is to give 3 percent vacant quota to Jats in Haryana
 iske liye sabhi dalon kii sahmati hasil kii jaaegi
 Till the Jats do not get reservation in the state, they will not get it at the center
 isliye march ke tisare hafte main haryana vidhansabha main bill laayaa jayega
 The comments march 2015 main jat pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri se mila tha
 It consisted of 70 representatives from different states
 piemo ne ek bayaan bhi jari kiya tha jisamen kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ne unke muddon ko dhyaan se suna he
 The government is currently reading the decision of the Supreme Court and will try to find a solution under the legal framework
 farvari 2016 main itani hinsa ke baad ek cameti bani he
 Meanwhile, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat today said that a committee of non-political people should be formed to decide the eligibility for reservation
 kai jagahon par halaat samaanya hai lekin kai jagahon par aaj bhi hinsa hui he
 Schools will start opening in Gurgaon from Tuesday
 haryana ko is hinsa se aarthik or saamaajik taur par ubarne main lanbaa vakt lag jayega

 # boycottkapilsharma is trending on social media followed by # boycottkapilsharmashow and # unsubscribesonytv
 is trend kii vajah kapil kaa navjot singh siddhu ko saport karnaa he
 Actually, Kapil Sharma said in an interview on the news that Sidhu is being removed from the show, i think that banning someone and removing Sidhu from the show is not the solution
 hamen sthaayee hal ko ore dekhnaa hoga
 On the question of the removal of Sidhu, Kapil said, "sidhu is busy with his work, so Archana Puran Singh shot with us
 '' vivaad par bolte hue kapil ne kaha- ''ye bahut choti chijen hai or ye sab kisi propagenda kaa hissaa bhi ho sakate hai
 i think banning someone and removing Sidhu from the show is not the solution
 hamen sthaayee hal ko ore dekhnaa hoga
 On the Pulwama attack, Kapil said- "we are with the government, but we need a permanent solution
" pulavama main hue kaayarna hamale main hamaare jawan shahid hue hai, jo nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 The guilty should be punished severely
 ''kapil ke is bayaan ke baad soshal media par yugers kaaphi naaraaz najar aa rahe hai
 Many people say that we gave Kapil Sharma a second chance, but he failed in it
 kisi ne likhaa, kapil kaa pakistan ke liye pyaar saaf najar aa rahaa he

 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena main siton ke bantwaare par jo khinchataan ho rahi he usne puure desh kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht kiya he
 This is surprising because the two parties have always been together in misery
 apni hindu vichaardhaara ke kaaran shivasena ne hameshaa bijepi kaa saath diya
 Shiv Sena founder Bala Saheb Thackeray raised many issues that the BJP did not like but despite this, an alliance between the two remained
 lekin is samay donon partiyon kaa kai dashakon kaa yah gathbandhan tut ke kagaar par he kyonki siton ke bantwaare par faisla nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The Shiv Sena is not willing to give as many seats as the BJP is asking for
 uskaa kahana he ki maharashtra main hameshaa shivasena senior partner rahi he
 But the bjp's stance has changed due to its immense success in the Lok Sabha elections
 usne loksabhaa chunaav main kul 23 siten jeetin jabaki shivasena 18 siten hi jeet pain
 So now BJP says that both parties are in equal position and both should get equal seats while Shiv Sena is adamant on 150 seats
 in donon partiyon ke takaraav ke kaaran unke sahyogi dal pasopesh main hai or ve kuch kah nahin paa rahe hai
 But there are some things that Shiv Sena is not liking
 masalan mumbai kii dadar seat par bijepi kaa daawa
 Dadar has once been the stronghold of Shiv Sena
 marathi bahul is ilaake main usne varshon tak apni kirti pataakaa fahraai he lekin 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main vahaan shivesna parajeet ho gai
 Now BJP wants Shiv Sena to give this seat to them
 iske alaava shivesna is baat se bhi khafa he ki bijepi ne kendra main uske kam saansadon ko mantri banaaya jabaki vaada kahin zyada kaa tha
 On the other hand, BJP is calling for the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava bijepi ko yah bhi pasand nahin aa rahaa he ki shivasena mukhyamantri pad kii pehle se daavedaar ho jaae
 This is contrary to his plan
 party kaa har bada netaa apane hisaab se chal rahaa he
 After Gopinath Munde, the party does not even have a powerful leader
 baharhaal, halaat kaaphi tanaavpurn hai
 Maybe there is a compromise at the last moment and they will fight together
 lekin bijepi ko kuch baaten samajni hongi
 The huge success in the Lok Sabha elections cannot be linked to the Vidhan Sabha
 vidhansabha main hameshaa mudde hameshaa alag hote hai or votaron kii soch alag hoti he
 BJP may have known this bitter truth in the by-elections held recently
 lekin uske baavjood usne haryana main apane sahyogi dal se qaraar todakar apane boote chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 This is a risky decision
 donon partiyon ko isse nuksaan hoga
 Haryana Janhit Congress may not be a major force in the state, but together with it, it can at least prevent the sharing of votes
 agar maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena samjhauta nahin hua to vahaan bhi party ke liye sarkaar bananaa asambhav sa hoga
 It is true that there are disputes between Congress and NCP
 donon partiyaan zyada se zyada siton ke liye lard rahi hai
 But both those parties have many political politicians and they know the pulse of the public

 ISIS bloodshed on Hathiyar's strength and prepares his army by making wireless a weapon
 yahi he iesas kaa asli khel
 And thanks to this game, he has made his reach and reach in more than 80 countries of the world by sitting in some cities of Iraq and Syria
 kai eps kaa kar rahaa istemaaliraq or syria ke kuch chote-bade shaharon se sidhe daniya ke kareeb 80 mulkon main iesas ne agar apni pahunch banaai he to uski vajah telegram, kik, jastapast
 Inn, Nasser
 me, maanbar
 Me, Twitter, Facebook, whatsapp, youtube, Instagram, these are the wireless wires of apps, platforms and internet
 ye wo jaal he jisneiss ko duniya kaa sabase bada ji kaa janjaal bana kar rakh diya he
 These are the wireless weapons that pose the greatest threat to the world, because through these same weapons connected to the Internet, IS is not only misleading Muslim youths around the world, but also for planning and implementing all their terrorist attacks
 Has been doing
 inamen se zyaadaatar vahi eps or communication system hai, jinka istemaal roj puri duniya karti he
 Everything from Twitter to Facebook, whatsapp, youtube and Instagram are included
 darasal in kaaman computer eps ke alaava internet par kuch aise soshal netwarking cites, eps or plateforms maujuud hai jinhen pakad paanaa behad mushkil he
 These include Telegram, Kick, Justpaste
 in, naser
 Me and Manbar
 me jaise eps or plateform shaamil hai
 Conversations on such apps and platforms are encrypted, ie do not get caught because this communication is always in code language
 masalan, syria main baitha koi aatankwaadi agar brusselles main apane kisi saathi ko aise hi kisi eps ke jariye koi paigaam bhejtaa he, to duniyaavaalon ko ye koi number yaa phir mahaj koi tasviir najar aegi
 Only the person sending and receiving the real message behind it knows
 jaankaron kii maane to aies ke aatankwaadiyon ke paas ab kuch aise andraed phone bhi maujuud hai, jinase internet par koi video massej aplod karne par use loket kar paanaa bhi mumkin nahin hota
 Two Russian brothers made the app
 This Russian bombing is taking place at IS bases from the sky of Telegramseria
 rus ne aies ko puri tarah mitaa dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Incidentally, the app that IS is using the most, Telegram, is made up of two Russian brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov
 is vakt duniya bhar main telegram ke 62 milian se bhi zyada yugers maujuud hai or inamen iesas ke bahut se aatankwaadi bhi shaamil hai
 Its private chatroom not only gives its subscribers the freedom to talk and avoid the eyes of the world, but you can also keep your mobile number hidden in it
 or yahi baat iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko sabase zyada suut kar rahi he
 IS is the most used of the communication app Telegram
 apni zyaadaatar media raleez yaa dhamkiyaan wo isi ap ke jariye duniya tak pahunchaata he
 ISIS has maintained its tele-communication and media center
 jinamein duniya ke kai mulkon ke iti export kaam karte hai
 According to reports, the entire operation of this wireless weapon of Baghdadi is overseen by Syrian origin IT expert Ahmed Abu Samra born in France
 propeganda channel kii shuruyatjaankaron kii maane to soshal netwarking site par haal ke dinon main aies ne jis tarah apane propeganda channel kii shuruyaat kii he, wo kisi anushaasit fouj kaa hissaa jaisaa lagata he
 Recently, a propaganda channel of IS surprised the world by seeing pictures and videos posted in Telegram learning the martial arts and weapons of terrorists
 darasal, ye chijen quality yani gunvattta ke maamle main itani aage thi, jaise ye kaam kisi aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa nahin, balki korporate media house kaa ho
 It is actually the media unit of IS, which not only updates video clips on social sites, but also publishes magazines in languages like Arabic and English and they have only one and only purpose, through them to trick the youth and make them IS Incite to join vaise telegram par aies kii badhati maujuudagi se pareshaan is company ne aise bahut se plateform ko block kar diya he, lekin jaise hi ek plateform block hota he, aies ke aatankwaadi kisi nae naam se ek doosraa plateform taiyaar kar lete hai
 IS is doing the same thing on other social networking sites including Twitter
 halaat kitne bekaabu ho chuke hai, iskaa andaaza sirf isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki telegram main ab aies ke bache-khuche plateform khuleam jang kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 a 40-second video is being shared on social media
 daawey ke mutabik is video main dikhaaya gaya he ki sena ke afasaron ne kis tarah ek ghar ke terres par jaakar ‘aatankwaadi’ se eke 47 chhinane ke bahadur karname ko anjaam diya
 It can be seen in the video that a man is talking to a policeman standing on the second terrace with a gun in his hand
 video dekhakar aisa lagata he ki pulisavaala bandook vaale shaks ko baton main uljhaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Just then, a man in plain clothes comes down from behind and grabs the gun from the gunman
 chhinajhapati main eke47 se goliyaan chalati hai
 Meanwhile, some other policemen also reach there and overcome the gunman
 video ko twitor or fasebuk par badi sankhya main share kiya gaya he
 When we searched on Facebook to know the truth of the claim, many results came out
 india todeffact chekatim ne apni padtaal me video ke daawey ko jhootha paaya
 Neither the man with the gun in his hand was a terrorist and neither was he from the Indian Army who snatched the gun from him
 jaanch se pataa chalaa ki ye video march 2012 kaa he
 People are raising questions about the truth of the video's claim, many net users raised questions raising doubts
 fasebuk yujar arjuna majhi frz ne apane coment main kaha ki videopunchaka he or jiske haath main AK47 he wo aatankwaadi nahin he
 We found that several media houses, including the Times of India, also reported in March 2012 on the incident as seen in the video
 hamanesrinagarasthit apane samvaadadaata se is video ko lekar sampark kiya to usne bataaya ki ye ghatana chah saal puraani he or jammu-kashmir ke poonch jile kii he
 The gunman was identified as Tahir Khan, an army jawan, and the men who beat him were local policemen
 kya kaha police nepulice ne bataaya, ‘khan ko apni patni par shaq tha ki uske kisi ke saath avaidh sambandh hai
 Khan was so lost in anger that he wanted to kill his wife
 wo rifl ke saath poonch main aayaa tha or apni patni kii talash kar rahaa tha
 The wife had managed to escape at that time
 lekin khan kii ore se kii gai andhadhundh firing main do logon kii maut ho gai thi or do anya ghayal ho gaye the
 Adding all the facts led to the conclusion that the claim made in the video was not only false but the incident was also six years old

 Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati has accused her coalition partner Akhilesh Yadav, who was a coalition partner till a few days ago, of refusing to give tickets to Muslims
 mayawati ne kaha he ki akhilesh ne mujhe sandesh bhijwaya ki musalamaanon ko zyada tikat nahin duun
 This was argued to polarize votes on religious grounds
 haalanki maine unki baat nahin maani
 With this statement of Mayawati, Muslims have come to the center of political discourse in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in the country
 khud ko musalamaanon kii hitaishi bataati rahi samaajawaadee party sawaalon ke ghere main aa gai he
 Questions are beginning to arise whether the SP is really opposed to the participation of Muslims in the democratic system of the country? Why did the SP president ask Mayawati not to give more tickets to Muslims, discussions have started in the political corridors
 raajnneeti se jude logon ke saath hi raajnneeti ke jaankaar or gaiyr raajnneetik vyakti bhi apane-apane hisaab se basapa supremeo ke is vaktavy kii vyakhya kar rahe hai
 Some are putting Akhilesh in the dock, while some are calling it Mayawati's political maya
 sabake apane-apane tark bhi hai
 Akhilesh was persecuting the polarization of votes
 Supremo Akhilesh Yadav may not have forgotten the 2014 and 2017 election results
 raajnneetik vishleshak amitabh tiwari kehete hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tab bhaajapa ke prachaar abhiyaan kii aguwai kar rahe pradhanmantri pad ke tatkaaleen ummidavaar (ab pradhanmantri) narendra modi apane sambodhano main khulkar kaha karte the ki chunaav main haar manjuur he, lekin tushtikaran kii raajnneeti nahin karuunga
 This was the first time in Modi's wave when the representation of Muslims of the state in the Lok Sabha was zero
 tiwari ne kaha ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi akhilesh ke naare 'kaam bolta he' par bhaajapa kaa ramajaan main bijli milegi to deepawali par bhi, kabristaan or shmashaan ke mudde baari pade the
 In such a situation, Akhilesh is scared to polarize votes
 musalamaanon ko lubhaane kii koshish karti rahi hai mayamayawati sapa pramukh dwaara musalamaanon ko zyada tikat dene se manaa kiye jane or ise na maanane kaa daawa kar swayan ko muslim hitaishi siddh karne kii koshish kar rahi hai, duusari taraf aankade kuch or hi kahani kah rahe hai
 If we look at the previous figures of the Lok Sabha elections, then it becomes clear that Mayawati, who is considered an expert in social engineering, has already been trying to make the Muslims dalha-muslim equation
 haal hi main sampann 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne 10 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat diya tha
 Six Muslim faces from the BSP and four from the SP were beating the electoral battlefield
 inamen se donon hi dalon ke teen-teen, kul chah ummidavaar chunaav jeet kar sansad pahunchane main safal rahe
 This was not the first time that the BSP gave tickets to more Muslims than the SP
 basapa ne 2014 main 19, 2009 main 14 or 2004 main 20 muslimon par daanv lagaaya tha, jabaki sapa ne 14, 11 or 12 musalamaanon ko hi tikat diya tha
 What was behind the alliance Muslim voters were the biggest reason behind Manashamayavati's friendship with Akhilesh
 soobe kaa muslim matadaata basapa se zyada sapa ko tavajjo detaa rahaa he
 Mayawati used a variety of experiments to bring Muslims into her court
 iske baad bhi muslim matadaata basapa kii tulana main sapa ko hi zyada ahmiyat dete rahe
 In such a situation, there was an alliance between the two in the Lok Sabha elections, then the BSP took those seats in the seat-wise, which can be won by the Muslim and Dalit equation
 38 siten main 24 siten aisi thim, jin par dalit muslim or basapa cader kaa purv chunaavon main prabhaav dekha gaya tha
 Mayawati also benefited from this and managed to win 10 seats out of 38 seats
 maaya nahin chhod paa raheen upi kii raajnneeti kaa mohraajnneeti ke jaankaron kii maane to desh ke sabase bade soobe kii chaar dafe mukhyamantri raheen mayawati uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa moh nahin chhod paa raheen
 At the time of the alliance before the elections, it was decided that Maya would be active in the politics of the Center, while in the politics of Akhilesh Pradesh
 maaya ko yah bharosa he ki unke base voter dalit ke saath muslimon kaa saath mil jaae to vah paanchavi baar mukhyamantri ban sakati hai
 In the same way as in 2007, she has formed an absolute majority government using the brahmin-dalit equation

 Not denying the possibility of becoming Prime Minister for the third time, BJP on Friday slammed Manmohan Singh, saying that after Holi, he has shown his true political color
 party ne sawaal kiya ki kahin yah unki ore se rahul gandhi kii pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari par palitha lagaana to nahin he

 (DDCA) main kathith ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye dilli sarkaar ke banaae gopal subrahmanyam ayog ko centre sarkaar ne gaiyrkanoonee qaraar de diya
 Information about this has been given by writing to the Delhi Government on behalf of the Lieutenant Governor's Secretariat
 kanoon likhaa he khat main itnaa
 
 
 In the letter sent by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung to the Chief Secretary of Delhi, citing several laws and notifications of the Central Government, it is written that the formation of the Commission is unconstitutional and illegal
 kyonki dilli main chuni hui sarkaar na to centre kii he or na rajya kii
 Therefore, it has no right to constitute a Commission of Inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1952
 grih mantralay ne kaha- faisle kii taamil hoisi chitthee main kanoonon kaa hawala dekar kaha gaya he ki 'grih mantralay dilli sarkaar kii ore se gathit jaanch ayog asanvaidhanik he
 Therefore, there is no legal effect of this commission
 sambandhit mantriparishad ko salaah di jaati he ki grih mantralay ke is faisle ke mutabik aage kii kaarywahi kare
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will reply to this letter by returning from Kolkata, sources in Delhi government said
 vah bengal global summit main hissaa lene ke liye vahaan gaye hue hai
 Interestingly, Kejriwal and Jaitley also appeared together on this platform
 sutron ne kaha ki 'grih mantralay ne ise radd nahin kiya he
 The Commission will continue its work
 'dilli sarkaar ke paas kya aadharais chitthee kii copy aaj tak ke paas he or isamen kahin bhi null and void shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya he
 That is, the Ministry of Home Affairs has declared this commission as unconstitutional, but not canceled
 dilli sarkaar isi ko aadhaar banaakar aage kii jaanch jari rakhane kaa tark de sakati he
 Jung had written a letter to the Center
 Earlier on December 25, Jung wrote a letter to the Central Government, calling this one-member inquiry commission illegal
 unhone kaha tha ki dilli sarkaar ne yahayog banane ke lieuparajyapal or centre sarkaar kii sahmati nahin lee he
 Therefore, this commission is illegal

 salmaan ke is ection avatar ko dekhne ke baad jaahir he phans ke liye is film ke relies kaa christmas tak intjaar karnaa mushkil he
 While sharing the poster on Twitter, Salman Khan wrote, liked Diwali gifts? See you at christmas now 'big bos ke ghar main vikaas gupta ne kiya shilpa scindia ko kisvaise to big bos ke ghar se ek badi khabar ye aa rahi he ki isamen jald hi priyank or dhinchik puja kii wild card entry hone vaali he
 But the second shocking news was that in the coming episodes, a new story of Shilpa Shinde and Vikas coming close will be seen
 darasal big bos lagjri bajet ke liye gharavaalon ko ek mushkil task denge, ye task hoga chin stand, is task ke tahat do timen banti jaaengi
 One team is from Punish and the other is Vikas Gupta's team
 ek team ke sadsy stand par chin ko kitne samay takatickar rakhane main kaamyaab honge is baat ko lekar muqabla hoga
 The other team i
e
 Punish's team will be seen making every possible effort to remove the members of the development team from the stand
 is task ke dauraan big bos kaa lon aria junk yard ban jayega
 When the water on the Punish development falls with full force on the face of development, at the same time, Vikas will lose his cool and attack Punish
 big bos ke ghar kaa sabase bada niyam todane par vikaas ko big bos jail bhej denge
 Now will this task be completed without development or will it be known in the latest episode? But when Vikas goes to jail, something will definitely happen that the audience will not expect at all
 darasal big bos ke letest episod promo main dikhaaya ja rahaa he ki chin stand task kaa niyam todane ko lekar jail main baithe vikaas achaanak shilpa scindia se maafee maangate najar aa rahe hai

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the border dispute with Xi Jinping on May 14 in Xi'an, he had only one message to convey to the Chinese president
 haalanki yah aisi baat thi jo beete kai barason main kisi bhi bhartiya netaa ne china se nahin kahi thi
 Modi had said that if India and China want to deepen the mutual union, they cannot ignore the "road blocks" in the relationship
 modi ne jin avarodhon ko ginvaaya, unamem sabase pehle sthaan par vaastavik niyantran rekha (elesi) thi&vah aspasht rekha jo bharat or china ko alag karti he
 According to officials, Modi was actually trying to bring the process back to the center of the border talks which has been a deadlock for almost two decades
 yah koshish elesi par donon pakshon kii alag-alag dharna ko spasht karne kii thi, jise kareeb 20 saal pehle donon deshon ne seemaa vivaad par baatcheet ke kendriya tatv ke rup main pahachaanaa tha or jiske sthaayee samaadhaan ke liye us par alag se baat kii jaani thi
 The process has been stuck in a deadlock since 2002 when China walked off the negotiating table amid attempts to exchange maps as there was resentment as to why India was referring to the area west of the Karakoram Pass
 gave? Modi told Xi directly that the confusion over LAC is a matter of grave concern
 unhone kaha ki pichley sitambar main shi ke bharat daure par isi aspashtataa kii chaaya dikhaai di thi jab teen hafton tak donon deshon kii sainya tukadiyaan aamane-saamne aa gayi kyonki donon kaa daawa tha ki ve jis jameen par khadi hai vah unke desh kaa hissaa he
 The Chinese President listened attentively to the Prime Minister but did not express any commitment on his part
 modi ko china se dilli laute teen hafte hue the ki chini sarkaar ne apana rang dikhaa diya
 In China's first public statement on the LAC process that had been stalled for years, a top foreign ministry official, Huang Xilian, said Beijing was anti-incumbency to restart the process

 Huang even went so far as to say that doing so would be "impracticable" in resolving the border dispute and issued a warning that the process of clarifying the LAC had further complicated it rather than narrowing the differences on the border dispute
 unhone china yatra par gaye bhartiya vidwaanon ke dal se kaha, “kuch saal pehle hamane ise saaf karne kii koshish kii thi par kuch dikkatein pesh ain jinhone halaat or jatil bana daale
 What were the problems? Asked this question, he said, "it is beyond my jurisdiction to give details
" ”vivaad kii rekhelisi shaayad iklauta aisa ahm tatv he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki himalay ke aar-paar baithe donon desh dobaaraa jang main na chale jaaen
 Despite this, there remains a lot of confusion on this
 jaisaa aksar “rekha ke paar chini ghuspaith” ke dauraan media main hamen bataaya jaataa he ki yah donon ore se sahamat rekha he, yah baat galat he
 There is neither any consensus on this nor is there any final boundary
 jaisaa naam se spasht he, yah aisa vibhaajan he jo un kshetron kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo philhal donon pakshon ke niyantran main hai, jin par seemaa vivaad ke hal hone tak koi faisla lambit he
 The first agreement between India and China on the border came after the 1962 war, which took more than three decades
 1993 main “aman or shanti banaae rakhane ke liye” kiya gaya samjhauta donon pakshon kii dharanaon main bhed ko sweekaar karte hue kahata he ki “jab kabhi jaruri hoga, donon paksh sanyukt rup se elesi ke un hisson kii jaanch karenge or use tay karenge jahaan unamem aapasi matbhed hai
 "the Second Boundary Agreement under the Confidence Restoration Measures (CBM) was reached in 1996, which went a step further with the resolution that both sides felt the need to arrive at" a common understanding on LAC "and" as soon as possible Will soon exchange maps according to their assumptions on LAC
 ”maanchitron kaa aadan-pradaan chaar saal baad shuru hua jab donon pakshon ne sabase kam vivaadit hisse par kaam karnaa shuru kiya&yah elesi kaa bich vaala hissaa tha
 Indian and Chinese officials say the exchange process that took place in June 2000 and 2001 had been very helpful, even though there were some differences over the depiction of the LAC, the most important of which was near Barahoti in Uttarakhand
 saal bhar baad haalanki jab donon pakshon ne nirnaayak pashchimi sector par vaarta shuru kii, jahaan bharat ke mutabik, aksai chin main china kaa kam-se-kam 38,000 varg kilometre parikshetra par kabja he, tab tasviir bigadane lagi
 a former Chinese official who was involved in the border talks told that China's opposition was on why India raised the issue of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) in the talks, even though India considers pok as an essential part of its enclave
 Ho
 adhikari ne kaha, “shuru main to hamaare matbhed bich vaale sector ko lekar the lekin hamane uskaa hal nikaal liya
 When we tried to reach an agreement on the western side, India said, "you have to decide the china-pakistan border first, then you can decide on the china-india border
" ” china ke liye aisa karnaa mushkil he, isliye ham ise jari nahin rakh sakate
 "by bringing the LAC back to the center of the latest stand-off agenda, India has given the message that both countries cannot afford to repeat the situation when the armies face-to-face in the Depsang and Chumar sectors of Ladakh
 aisi sthiti ne 2013 main pradhanmantri lee kekiyang or 2014 main raashtrapati shi ke bharat daure par rishton main khinchaav paidaa kar diya tha
 In his address to Beijing's Shinhua University on May 15, Modi gave this message in clear terms: For the first time any Indian leader has done this publicly and that too in China
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, “seemaa kshetra ke samvedansheel ilaakon par hameshaa anishchay kii talwaar lataki rahati he
 This is because both sides do not know where LAC is in these areas
 isiilie maine ise spasht karne ke liye prakriya ko dobaaraa shuru karne kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Calling for the long-forgotten 1993 agreement, Modi said that it can be done "free from any prejudice due to its conditions on the boundary question"
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki elesi ko spasht karne kii prakriya ko tarjeeh dene main jo jokhim nihit he, vah nae gatirodh ko janm de rahaa he jiske chalate donon pakshon ko waapas vaarta kii mej par aana hoga
 Indian officials say the demand to clarify the LAC was not a condition that could create obstacles in other dimensions of the relationship
 yah saaf nahin he ki china bhi ise aise hi dekhtaa hoga
 Now, on China's latest "code of Conduct" proposal, officials say it may have been brought with the intention of stopping the pending process of updating India's infrastructure
 kul milakar sthiti yah he ki donon desh ek baar phir seemaa vivaad par koi samaadhaan nikaalane ke maamle main ek nae gatirodh ke bich ja ghire hai
 According to astrologers and scriptures, Hanuman is believed to be immortal and therefore he is one of the most active deities in the Kali Yuga
 goswami tulsidas dwaara rachit shriramcharita maanas ke anusaar mata sita dwaara pavanputra hanumanji ko amarta kaa vardaan diya gaya tha
 With the effect of this boon, Pawanaputra is included in Ashtachiranjeevi
 hanuman ji ko sheeghra prasann karne ke liye bas man se unka dhyaan karnaa hi kaaphi hota he
 Hanuman ji's day is Tuesday and Saturday, so even by worshiping people, they give boon very quickly
 lekin agar aap apni manokamanaayen jald hi puraa karnaa chaahate hai to pipal kii puja yaa phir iske patton ke kuch chamatkaari upaay karke hanumanji ko prasann kar sakate hai
 With the grace of Hanumanji all the sufferings of his devotees are removed
 paison se judi samasyaayein, gambhir rog or kundali dosha bhi inaki krupa se nasht ho jate hai
 
 
 - If you are going to take measures to please Hanuman ji, then keep in mind that you are completely pure with your mind
 kisi bhi tarah ke adharmik kaary karne se bachein
 Also be honest with your work and duty
 aise vyakti kii manokamanaayen hanumanji jald hi puri karte hai
 - If you are troubled by money problem or disease then you should take this remedy on Tuesday and Saturday
 saptaah ke harmangalvaar or shanivarako brahm muhoort main uthakar nity karmon se nivrutt hokar kisi pipal ke ped se 11 pattey tod laaen
 While plucking the leaves, make sure that the leaves are not severed or broken
 iske baad in 11 patton ko saaf pani yaa gangaajal se dho len
 After this, write the name of Sri Ram on these leaves by mixing Kumkum, Ashtagandha and Sandalwood
 naam likhte samay hanuman chalisa kaa paath karte jaaen
 After this, prepare a garland of these leaves with the name Shriram
 - taiyaar pipal ke patton kii maala ko kisi bhihanumanji mandir main jaakar unakipratimaa ko arpit karen
 Thus, keep doing this remedy on every Tuesday and Saturday
 kuch samay baad aapako sakaaratmak parinaam praapt hone lagenge
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat again raised the issue of conversion at a Delhi event
 unhone kaha ki abhaav or asuvidha ko aadhaar banaakar dharm parivartan karwaanaa galat he
 In the program of an organization associated with the Sangh in Delhi, Bhagwat said that it is very wrong to convert people living in lack
 abhi shanivaar ko bhi mohan bhagwat ne gharvaapasi kaarykram ko sahi qaraar diya tha
 He said that there is nothing wrong in bringing back those who have wandered out of Hinduism
 dharmaparivartan ko lekar jo koharaam machaa he, wo roke nahin ruk rahaa he
 After Mohan Bhagwat, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has also waged a religious war
 vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa ashok singhl ne kaha kaa ham dharmaparivartan ke liye nahin, dil jeetne aae hai
 Ashok Singhal did not stop here
 unhone tisare vishwayuddh kaa dar bhi dikhaaya
 He said that the world is moving towards the third world war with Islamic terrorism
 muslim, isai or communist kii vajah se vishwa yuddh hona tay he
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu also believes that voluntary conversion is fine, but if it happens forcibly, it is wrong
 sangh or sarkaar ke is najariye kaa congress ne sakht virodh kiya he
 Congress leader Rashid Alvi said that with the earnest Singhal giving, hearts can be broken or won
 dharm ko lekar chhide yuddh main ek taraf sarkaar or sangh he, to duusari ore sampurna vipaksh
 If the opposition in the Rajya Sabha is showing eye to the government, then the silent form of the Prime Minister is giving more spark to the spark
 dekhnaa he ki dharmaparivartan par sarkaar vipaksh kaa dil jitati he yaa vipaksh sarkaar kaa

 karnataka main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish karne par rajyapal hansraj bharadwaj ke khilaaf kadam uthaate hue rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ne unki barkhaastagi kii maang ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh se milane kaa faisla kiya he or mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa se apane samarthak vidhayakon kii raashtrapati ke samaksh parade karaane ko kaha he
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Jaitley said, the NDA Center strongly condemns the Karnataka Governor's move to send a report to the government
 rajyapal kaa aacharan pakshpatpurna he
 It violates all constitutional rules and principles
 is baat main tanik bhi andeh nahin he ki yediurppa sarkaar ko vidhansabha main purna bahumat praapt he
 He said that as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court, 11 suspended members were deemed to be members of the BJP and they are bound by its whip
 unhone kaha ki rajg ne pradhanmantri se milakar is mudde ko uthaane evam rajyapal ko waapas bulaae jane kii maang karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Jaitley said, our intention is to raise two specific issues before the Prime Minister
 pehla, yah report asanvaidhanik he or spashtat: centre sarkaar dwaara use khaarij kar diya jaae or doosraa, karnataka ke rajyapal baar-baar asanvaidhanik kadam uthaa rahe hai atev unhen samvidhan kaa ulanghan karne ke kaaran unhen waapas bula liya janaa chahie
 The NDA leadership has also asked Yeddyurappa to bring all his supporting mlas to Delhi and parade before the President to prove his numbers
 jetali ne kaha, ham sarkaar kaa samarthan karne vaale sabhi vidhayakon ko raashtrapati ke paas le jaayenge or raashtrapati bhawan main apni takat kaa pradarshan karenge kyonki sadan main shakti pareekshan kii jarurat hi nahin he
 An emergency meeting of the NDA was held at the residence of LK Advani, the working president of the coalition, to discuss the issue raised by Bhardwaj's report
 bataaya jaataa he ki bharadwaj ne karnataka main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii sifarish kii he
 Jaitley said that these 11 mlas have withdrawn letters written on October 6, 2010 regarding withdrawal of support from Yeddyurappa government
 unhone kaha, vidhayakon ne swayan hi kaha he ki ve sarkaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 The NDA says 121 mlas are supporting the Yeddyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka and the opposition has only 97 seats in the 225-member assembly
 bhaajapa is baat se bhi naaraaz he ki rajyapal vishesh satr bulaane kii mukhyamantri kii salaah par dhyaan nahin de rahe hai
 Jaitley said, the logical process would have been to conduct a strength test in the House
 jab tak sarkaar bahumat main he, samvidhan ke tahat rajyapal uski salaah par kaam karne ko baadhya hai
 Bhardwaj has committed unconstitutional acts by not acting as per the advice of the Council of Ministers
 punjab ke mukhyamantriprakash singh badalne apni party shiromani akali dal or sahyogi bijepi ke bich kisi tarah ke takaraav se saaf inkaar kiya he
 Badal said that there is hardly any issue of deadlock between the two parties
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki donon dalon ke bich sambandh tuutane se rajya kii shanti ko khatra paidaa ho saktaa he
 Badal said after a sports competition organized on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev's birth anniversary, 'bjp's national leadership will never break ties with its oldest ally Akali Dal
 ' navjot singh siddhu ke haalia bayanon ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha, 'donon dalon ke bich shaayad hi gatirodh kaa koi mudda he kyonki gathbandhan ke ghatak dalon ke sabhi muddon ko aapasi sahmati se sulajhane kaa antanirhit tantra he
 Many BJP leaders, including Sidhu, had said that the Akali Dal violated coalition religion by linking with INLD in Haryana
 haalanki, badal ne yah bhi kaha ki agar bijepi gathbandhan todatii he to punjab kii shanti khatre main pad jaaegi
 He said, 'if BJP breaks this alliance then peace in Punjab will be in danger
 bijepi ke saath hamaara rishta 30 saal purana he
 This is a true relationship and the BJP should understand this
 ' unhone kaha ki akali dal-bijepi kaa gathbandhan raashtra or punjab ke hit main he
 Badal claimed that he met BJP President Amit Shah and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and both of them supported the Akali dal-bjp alliance
 iske saath hi donon netaaon ne kaha he ki ve yah nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki kuch bijepi netaa is gathbandhan ke khilaaf kyon hai

 While addressing this rally in Karachi on Tuesday, Maulana Rauf Asghar is saying that by next February 5, when we once again celebrate Kashmir Solidarity Day, Delhi will be shaken
 sutron ke mutabik is raily se jaish-e-mohammad ke fidainon kii 7 timen mangalvaar ko bharat ke vibhinn shaharon ke liye ravaanaa kar di gai hai
 December 2018, Jaish's top trainer Commander Abdul Rashid Ghazi managed to sneak into Jammu and Kashmir

 The CBI is saying that Vijay Singla, nephew of Railway Minister Pawan Bansal, took the money, but there is currently no answer to the question whether Singla is the last link in the bribe? Or did Singla transfer the bribe amount to someone else? There are many questions to which the investigating agency is trying to find answers
 lihaaja zarurat padi to sibiai rail mantri pawan bansal se bhi poochtacha kar sakati he
 Actually, sources reveal that Vijay Singla has hinted at a big conspiracy in the bribe
 philhal yah saaf nahin he ki pawan bansal se poochtacha kab hogi
 But let us tell you why can Pawan Bansal be questioned? Actually, the whole matter is related to the appointment of a senior officer of Railway Board
 saath hi ye sawaal bhi khadey ho rahe hai ki kya railway board ke adhikari kii niyukti bina rail mantri ke dastakht ke mumican he? rail mantri se poochtacha isliye bhi mumkin he ki ghoose us bhaanje ne lee he jo rail mantri ke chunaavon ke liye fund ikattha karne kaa kaam karata tha
 The railway minister can also be interrogated because the entire bribe has taken place under the nose of the railway minister
 darasal, sibiai yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahi he ki rishwat kii rail kaa driver koun he? sibiai yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki kya vijay singla ne ghoose ke paise khud rakhe yaa phir kahin aage bhi pahunchaaya?ab tak kii jaanch main yah saaf ho gaya he ki vijay singla or sandip goyal ne ghoose lee
 The bribe was given to Railway Minister's nephew Vijay Singla and his friend Sandeep Goyal for the promotion of Mahesh Kumar and the amount of bribe was collected by Manjunath, who was the mastermind of the entire game
 manjunath ke liye rahul yadav or samir sandhir ne paise ikattha kiye
 Now it will be seen whether the CBI is able to find out whether the amount of bribe remained till Vijay Singla or even to someone else and if reached, to what extent? yun to lagbhag har kalakaar bollywood main entry karnaa chahta he lekin mayanagari mumbai main aane ke baad silver screen tak kaa safar itnaa aasaan nahin hota he

 Fitbit Versa 2 kii keemat 20,999 rupee heis smartwatch main in-bilt Alexa diya maujuudasmartwatch kii demand bazaar main teji se bad rahi he
 Many companies are moving from their fitness trackers to the smartwatch market
 haalanki ios yugers ke liye Apple watch siries uplabdh he, lekin android yugers ke paas dheron opshan hai, lekin best opshans kii kami he
 We are going to give a review here about one such option and that is the Versa 2 of the most trusted brand of the wearable world, Fitbit
 company ne apni is smartwatch ko haal hi main bharat main launch kiya tha or company ne isaki keemat 20,999 rupee rakhi he
 Let's know if it is worth investing in this smartwatch? Build quality and design: Fitbit Versa 2's dial is square shaped and has a soft rubber strap
 chote haath or bade haath waalon ke liye yahaan do sies ke strap box ke saath aate hai, jise aap behad aasaani se dial ke saath atech kar sakate hai
 It is very light in weight and there are no rough edges anywhere
 ise aasaani se dinabhar pahan kar rakhaa ja saktaa he, saath hi sote vakt bhi ise pahane rakhane main koi samasya nahin aati he
 Its display 1
 34-inch kaa he or disple yahaan pehle kii tarah LCD nahin balki AMOLED he
 In such a situation, its black pixels are also very good
 ye disple kaaphi wibrant, panchi or brit he
 It has a button on the left side, which is used to wake the screen and come back from the menu
 saath hi ise hold kar rakhane par Alexa ko on kiya ja saktaa he
 The special thing about this smartwatch is that it also has microphone support, in this way voice response and Alexa communication can be done in it
 ise olves on disple ke saath utaara gaya he, isliye isamen time check karne ke liye baar-baar batan press karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 The display has uniform bezels all around
 haalanki in bejals kii chaudaai kam kii ja sakati thi
 This would give users a slightly larger screen
 iske alaava aapako bataa den yugers ke paas strap ke colors ke kaaphi opshans maujuud hai
 Also, let us tell you that 50M comes with water resistant, in this case it can also be used for swimming
 iske disple main gorilla glass protection ke liye diya gaya he
 Overall it is quite luxurious and this look is also very premium
 parformens:fitbit Versa 2 ek fitness trekar hone ke saath-saath smartwatch he
 In such a situation, it has many functions and can be found by downloading some new apps
 udhaaharan ke taur par calculator in-bilt nahin aata he, lekin aap ise alag se install kar sakate hai
 It is very smooth to operate
 jahaan tak fitures kii baat he to is watch ke jariye aap heart rate, eksrasij, sleep, diet or mahilaayein menstrual saaikal trek kar sakati hai
 Likewise it is also easy to connect
 yugers isamen inakming kol, massej or ap notifications check kar sakate hai
 Calls can be received or disconnected from the watch itself and the app can read notifications as well as voice reply with the help of a microphone
 isamen NFC bhi maujuud he, jisase quick pement bhi kii ja sakati he
 This allows some sports to be tracked along with exercise
 eksrasij kaa proper data ap se trek kiya ja saktaa he or gol bhi set kiye ja sakate hai
 As far as sleep tracker is concerned, it also has a smart alarm called smartwake, which after a good sleep wakes you up on its own in the morning
 ye mashin larning par kaam karata he
 In such a situation, you can avoid the sound of alarm
 acchhee baat ye he ki iskaa wibrasion motor bhi kaaphi behatar he
 Women can track systems, log moods and even cycle cycles with the help of a menstrual tracker
 ye agle saaikal ke shuru hone kaa prediction bhi karata he
 Talking about some more features, features like timer, weather, reminder, agenda and music control can also be taken advantage of
 yahaan clock phase ke bhi dheron opshan hai, jinhen ap ke jariye acces kiya ja saktaa he
 Talking about battery life, the company has claimed a battery of 4 days here, which is true to some extent
 lekin olves on disple ke saath bydaree parformens par asar padataa he
 We have run it for three and a half days with Always On Display
 phul charge hone main ise ek ghante ke kareeb kaa vakt lagata he
 Keep in mind that its charger is very unique, so take it with you
 kuch negative baton kaa zikr karen to jaisaa ki hamane upar kaha ki disple main bejals aria ko kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Similarly, the music feature here does not directly control the smartphone's current player
 iske alaava news ke liye aapako indian media ke kisi ap kaa saport nahin miltaa he or ap notification main yahaan hindi kaa saport nahin he
 Also, some in-built clock faces could also be given here
 iske alaava aapako bataa den kabhi-kabhi charge karne ke baad yaa phone on-of ke baad bluetooth on rahane ke baad bhi ye auto conect nahin hota he
 Verdict: Leave aside some of the shortcomings mentioned above, this is a fairly good smartwatch
 khaastaur par ise fitness treckers pasand kar sakate hai
 The good thing is that if you like to talk to Alexa, then there is in-built support of this voice assistant
 android yugers ise ek behatar vikalp ke rup main dekh sakate hai to vahiin aipal yugers ise aipal siries ke saste opshan ke taur par pasand kar sakate hai

 He said that the leadership of the country will decide what is the strategy to deal with Pakistan, but they want that like a strong country, Pakistan should be taught a lesson by giving a befitting reply
 ramdev ne kaha ki jis tarah hamaare logon kii shahadat ho rahi he vah afsos kii baat he
 He said that this pain is also in the heart of Modi
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke logon ke dil main rashtrabhakti he, is baat par unhen puraa yakeen he

 unhone kaha ki patanjali saikadon saamaan banaata he, lekin sirf 5 chijen aisi hai jinamein gomutra kaa istemaal hua he
 Ramdev said that there can be no question of any deception, because according to the law of the country, it is necessary to write clearly in labeling what things have been used to make anything

 If any country is attacked, then there are signs of Pakistan
 
 
 
 Jaitley said that whenever a terrorist incident happens in the whole world, its wire connects to Pakistan from somewhere
 chaahe america, paris ho yaa phir pulavama
 Pakistan's hand is seen in every terrorist incident
 pakistan ke mantri tak is baat ko qubul kar chuke hai ki unke yahaan aatanki sanghathan sakriy hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to raise a voice against terror
 abhinandan ke waapas aane ke baad bharat kaa sakht ravaiya badalegaa nahin
 We will fight against terror

 Also, the liquor supply will be same as in the cantonment area and military station
 ramgarh or anya ilaakon se siesadi canteen, danapur or anya ikaayiyon ke liye sharaab kaa parivahan army escort ke saath hoga
 The compulsion of vehicles with digital lock and GPS is over
 haalanki utpaada kamishnar aditya das ne kaha he ki sainik sharaab pikar tay kshetra se baahar ghumenge to un parsharabbandi kanoonke tahat karrwai hogi
 Since all the military or paramilitary forces present in Bihar, the excise department gives permission to sell liquor in the canteen

 On giving liquor to ex-servicemen, the department clearly believes that they are different from the serving soldiers

 They will not be able to drink alcohol out of the cantonment or bring home

 It may be noted that there was a meeting with the army officers under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh on the relaxation given to the soldier or ex-soldier on alcohol

 Former England captain Tony Greig has lashed out at the BCCI for the economic loss by promoting T20 cricket instead of Test
 unhone diares kaa virodh karne par bhi bisisiai kii kadi aalochana kii he
 Giving the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdray lecture on Lord's, Greg said that bcci's attitude towards earning millions of dollars from the success of the Indian Premier League and Champions League is neglecting Test cricket
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko khel kii samasyaon ke prati apana swaarthee ravaiya chhodkar cricket kii bhaavana kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 He said, for India, the IPL and the Champions League have become more important than the international schedule
 bharat ne khel kaa kuch hissaa nijee hiton ko bech diya he, or iske kuch prashaskon ke hiton ke takaraav ke kaaran khel bhaavana ke anukool kaam karnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Greg said, India's partisan attitude towards Test cricket and its stand on certain issues, attitude towards ICC corruption investigation, apathetic attitude towards expeditious enforcement of anti-doping rules, alleged corruption of IPL and former Australia Prime Minister Its role in the absence of a process to prevent John Howard from becoming the ICC vice-president is a few examples
 greg ne bisisiai par chote deshon ko dhamkaakar isisi kii baithkon main unke vot hathiyaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said, the BCCI has more control over cricket, as it has enough votes to oppose any resolution in ICC meetings
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki kuch deshon kaa guzaara bharat se milane vaali aarthik sahaayta ke bina nahin chal saktaa
 "many problems of the ICC will be solved if India accepts that cricket is more important than earning crores of dollars and making cricketers richer," Greg said
 unhone diares sweekaar nahin karne ke liye bhi bisisiai ko aade haathon liya
 The comments unhone kaha, yah khel ke liye acha nahin he, jab media kii sukhiryon main kharaab faisle hon, jinase khel ke nattejey par asar padaa ho
 DRS is not 100 per cent correct, but it can overcome the shortcomings of umpires' decisions
 greg ne kaha, ise thukaraane ke bharat ke paas do kaaran hai
 The first is that its superstars did not have a good experience with DRS in the initial days and secondly BCCI believes that this is not entirely correct
 bhartiya superstar cricketron ko chahie ki bahumat ke faisle ko maane or diares ko sweekaar karen
