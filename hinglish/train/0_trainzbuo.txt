 This drama is getting a lot of love in Delhi

 The Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana was launched in October 2014 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was formed in May 2014
 is yojana ke tahat desh ke sabhi saansadon ko apane-apane chunaav kshetron main pehle ek-ek gaanv ko god lenaa tha
 Within a year, the village was to be developed on the lines of a model village so that it could stand on its own feet following the ideals of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 rashtriya str par is yojana ko teen charnon main puraa kiya janaa he
 While in 2015 all mps had to develop a model village by choosing a village for themselves, in 2016 and 2017, they had to adopt 1-1 villages once again
 is puri yojana ke tahat desh ke sabhi saansadon ko 2019 tak kam se kam teen gaanvon ko vikaas ke top gear main pahunchane kaa tha
 This scheme of Modi government will be completed in 3 years in October
 aise main sawaal he ki kya in teen saal ke dauraan god liye gaye kisi gaanv ne apane pair par khadey hone kaa hunar siikhaa? yaa phir ek baar phir desh ke sabhi saansad ek kharaab gargian sabit hue kyonki teen saal baad bhi gaanv na to apane pairon par khadey ho paae or na hi vah apane gargian kii god se neeche utar sake?ise bhi padhein: mukhyamantriyon ko teen saal main kamjor kar majboot hue pradhanmantri modiadarsh gram yojana- pehla charankendra sarkaar dwaara die gaye aankadon ke mutabik saansad adarsh gram yojana ke pehle charan main loksabhaa ke 543 saansadon main se 500 saansadon ne apane chunaav kshetra main ek gaanv ko god liya
 On the other hand, out of the total 254 members of the Rajya Sabha, 203 members have selected a village for themselves as per the plan
 loksabhaa or rajya sabha milakar jahaan desh main kul 796 saansad the, vahiin lagbhag dhai saal baad bhi 93 saansadon ne apane liye gaanv kaa chayan nahin kiya he
 That is, in the first phase, only 703 villages across the country were selected to be put on the top gear of development
 adarsh gram yojana- doosraa charansarkari aankadon ke mutabik, is yojana ke duusare charan main sthiti or bhi kharaab he
 Out of 545 mps of Lok Sabha, only 286 mps have selected a village for themselves
 vahiin 259 saansadon ko abhi bhi apane liye ek-ek gaanv kaa chayan karnaa he
 At the same time, out of 243 mps present in the Rajya Sabha, only 94 mps have selected the adopted villages
 abhi bhi 152 saansadon dwaara duusare charan ke liye ek gaanv chunaa janaa baaki he
 So, according to statistics, out of a total of 788 mps for the second phase, only 380 mps have selected a village for themselves
 vahiin 411 saansadon ko yojana ke is charan ke liye gaanv kaa chayan karnaa abhi baaki he
 That is, in the second phase, more than 50 percent of the mps have not yet completed the process of adopting a village
 ise bhi padhein: GST se hua notebandi kaa ulta, modi ke cashles india kii niklegi hawa?adarsh gram yojana- teesraa charanadarsh gram yojana kaa teesraa charan puure adarsh gram yojana par gambhir sawaal khadaa karata he
 As of now, only 34 mps out of 545 Lok Sabha mps have decided to adopt a village for themselves in this phase
 vahiin rajyasabha ke 243 saansadon main mahaj 11 saansadon ne jaruri prakriya ko puraa kiya he
 Lizaha, according to the data, so far 743 mps have not selected a single village for the third phase out of a total of 788 mps
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane chunaav kshetra varanasi se yojana ke duusare charan ke liye 17 farvari 2016 ko nagepur gram panchayat kaa chayan kiya tha
 Jayapur village was selected by PM Modi on 10 November 2014 for the first phase
 vahiin tisare charan ke liye khud piem modi ko apane liye ek gaanv kaa chayan karnaa baaki he
 Now that there is this speed of adoption to make villages ideal, obviously it will be interesting to wait for those figures of the government to know how many villages stand on their feet after the whole exercise

 To be in the same class twice or in the same class more than two years
 un dinon ham par apana base majboot karne kaa bhoot savaar tha
 We were found less in classes and more on playgrounds, gymnasiums and friends' heels
 un dinon ham par kuch kar guzarane kaa bhoot savaar tha
 No one has been able to do like that
 un dinon ham padhai ke alaava sab-kuch kiya karte the
 It was stuck in the 12th examination that it would never cross the boat
 maa or nani ne na jane koun-koun se devi-devataaon se mannaten maang lee thi
 From Dih Baba of the village to Brahma Baba, there was a vow to burn and make offerings, and we too were just stubborn

 There may be something better to do next
 vaise bhi schuli padhai or duniyavi jindagi kaa ek-duusare se kuch khaas lenaa-dena nahin hota

 Today all these stories are missing because the Bihar Board toppers case is stuck
 ve aaj sari media kii najaron main hai or unka postmortem chal rahaa he
 However, it should have been done that on the pretext of those toppers, there would have been talk on Bihar or on the entire Indian education system (rotten street system)
 kuch amulchul badlaav ke kaarykram taiyaar hote lekin ham bhartiya bhi to sef khilne ke aadi hai
 We become happy only by hunting small
 ham vyavastha parivartan kii badi-badi baaten to karte hai lekin mauka aane par bagale jhaankne lagate hai
 The state of Bihar has always been mourned in this matter
 
 
 abhi pichley varsh skool kii deevaaron par chadh kar parikshaarthiyon ko chit va parchiyaan pahunchane vaali tasviir jehan se utari bhi nahin thi ki toppers kaa ek or bavandar khadaa ho gaya

 After all, how will India grow without Bihar? Will India ever be able to grow except for one of the crumbling states (education system)? Ask yourself the question, will there be any way out of this question

 At the same time, due to the work of the BJP government at the center, the percentage of people who like the party is also the same
 yani ki 36 pratishat log modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii vajah se bijepi ko pasand karte hai
 Since it is an assembly election, we wanted to know how many people have liked the working of Chief Minister Raghubar Das? In Jharkhand, only 12 percent people have been affected by the work done by Chief Minister Raghubar Das in the last five years
 kisi bhi rajya main jab chunaav hota he to vahaan ke sthaneey mudde or ummidavaar kaaphi myne rakhte hai
 In such a situation, we wanted to know how many people will vote for BJP because of the candidates? The percentage of people who like the candidates decided by the party is just 4 percent

 Harbhajan Singh, who was a member of India's 2011 World Cup winning team on the stage of Salaam cricket and former Pakistan captain misbah-ul-haq, also spoke openly on the relationship between the two countries
 donon ne hi raajnneetik tanaav ke kaaran ke kaaran cricket sambandh thap kar die jane se asahmati jataai
 Harbhajan said that cricket should be kept separate from politics
 bhajji ne kaha ki jab bhi donon deshon ke bich talkhi badhati he, cricket match band ho jate hai
 During this, hockey matches are played, trade between the two countries goes on, but cricket matches are not played
 unhone kaha ki jab band ho, to yah sabhi band ho
 Why only cricket
 sabhi chizon ko ek hi taraazoo main taula janaa chahie
 Harbhajan, popularly known as Turbanator, said that there is no change when we meet Pakistan players, "whenever we meet Pakistan players, we never feel that there has been any change
" ham agar paak cricketron ko janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen bhi de dete hai to desh main hamen gaaliyaan padani shuru ho jaati hai
 There will be some such people in Pakistan too
 hinsa ke samarthak kuch udhar bhi honge, kuch idhar bhi honge
 But this does not mean that the whole of Pakistan or the whole of India is bad
 hamen insaaniyat ko upar rakhana chahie
 Misbah also agreed, agreeing with Bhajji's opinion that any country in the world plays, but the cricket family is one
 khel logon ko kareeb laane ke liye hota he na ki dur karne ke liye
 Describing humanity as essential, he said that people of both countries enjoy the indo-pak competition
 inhen isse dur rakhana thik nahin
 Let us know that bilateral cricket relations between India and Pakistan have been stagnant for years

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko sansad ke central haul main rashtriya jan pratinidhi sammelan main shirkat kii
 Addressing the first public representative conference, PM Narendra Modi spoke on many issues including social justice, the Constitution of India, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 is dauraan piem modi ne kaha, 'hamaare samvidhan kii visheshta adhikaron or kaaryon ke bantwaare ke kaaran nahin he
 The country had done evils for centuries
 manthan se jo amrit niklaa use hamaare samvidhan ke andar jagah mili
 It was about social justice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi lagata he ki saamaajik nyaay kaa ek or bhi dayera he
 Somebody tell me, there is electricity in one house, there is no electricity in the next house, does it not become the responsibility of social justice that there should be electricity in other house also
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ek jila aage he, doosraa peeche he, kya saamaajik nyaay kii baat karne main ye baadhyataa nahin he ki wo jila bhi barabari main aae
 Therefore, the principle of social justice motivates us all to take responsibility
 ho saktaa he desh jahaan sabaki apeksha hogi vahaan, nahin pahunchaa hoga
 But 5 districts have reached forward in the state, three are behind
 un teen ko bhi barabari par laayaa ja saktaa he
 The PM said, "those who do good continue to do good, but those who have fallen behind are in the state of falling behind
" hamen or baariki main jane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 There is an atmosphere of federalism in the states
 rajya or sansad ke pratinidhi baithkar saath charchaa karte hai
 Competition environment has been created
 par desh jo apeksha karata he, use puraa karnaa he to puraane parameter se chalane par parinaam nahin milegaa
 'competition on cleanliness said on Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,' When the ranking of cleanliness started, a competition was created
 ek nagar peeche rah gaya to gaanv ke log hi aawaaj uthaane lage
 Movement stands, why is the country not moving forward? So why don't we set some criteria for those districts in the country? Consider the publication that has already been done and create 48 parameters
 isamen peeche ke jile hai, anubhav ye aayaa ki jo 10 parameter main peeche hai to wo sab main peeche hai
 'development of 115 districts will improve country's Dashmim Modi stressed on the development of 115 districts of the country during this period
 unhone kaha ki uplabdh sansaadhan se ek jila aage gaya he to doosraa kyon nahin
 There is the issue of leadership and governance
 unhone kaha ki saansad or vidhayak sabhi colector or adhikariyon ke saath baithen
 Responsibility for new officers During this, PM Modi also emphasized on the appointment of young officers
 unhone kaha, 'main kisi kii aalochana karne ke liye nahin kah rahaa hum
 Generally, the district collectors are 30 years old
 in 115 jilon main 80 pratishat se zyada jo dm the wo 40 kii umr se zyada the, koi 45 ke bhi the
 Now tell me who is 45, he has many personal works
 zyaadaatar state pramotive officer hai, unhen hi bheja gaya
 From there the thought has been that the backward district is there, send it only
 'piem ne is samasyaka samaadhaan bataate hue aahvaan kiya, 'hamen sochna chahie ki agle 5 saal main sirf nae tej dm ko lagaaie, dekhie kya antar aata he

 Gopal Rai, Cabinet Minister of Delhi and Delhi State Convenor of Aam Aadmi Party said that the feelings of the country are different and the feelings of the Congress are different
 congress ne dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath kisi bhi prakaar kaa gathbandhan na karne kii baat kii he
 Similarly, the announcement to field its candidates in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal also puts a question mark on the intent of the Congress
 kahin congress kaa bijepi ke saath aghoshit gathbandhan to nahin ho gaya he
 Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Gopal Rai said that for the last four years, the Congress has been speaking the same language that the BJP speaks in Delhi
 bijepi kii pichley paanch saal kii taanaashaahee ko dekhte hue desh kii janata main loktantr ko bachaane kii bhaavana jaagi
 People wanted that the entire opposition of the country unite and save the country from this dictatorship of Modi and Shah
 congress ne desh ke karodon logon kii us manshaa kaa galaa ghontne kaa kaam kiya he
 Rai said that the way the Congress is contesting its candidate elections against the opposition parties across the country, it appears that the Congress is indirectly helping the BJP
 aisa lagata he ki jis prakaar se punjab main bijepi ne aam aadmi party ko haraane ke liye apratyaksh rup se congress ko jitaane main uskaa saath diya, usee ahsaan kaa badla chukaane ke liye congress dilli main aam aadmi party ko haraane ke liye apratyaksh rup se bijepi kii madad kar rahi he
 Gopal Rai said that during the 2015 election, the Aam Aadmi Party contested Delhi elections with the public and had to forfeit the bail of the undisclosed coalition of Congress and BJP
 usee tarj par ek baar phir aam aadmi party puure damakham ke saath dilli ke loksabhaa chunaav main apane pratyaashee utaaregi or bijepi-congress ke is aghoshit gathbandhan kaa kadaa jawaab degi
 Gopal Rai said that the national organization of the Congress was yet to argue that the organization of the state was not ready for an alliance, but today the statement of the Congress not to make an alliance after the meeting of the national organization and the state organization came It shows that the party is bigger than the country for the Congress

 paanch rajyon ke chunaav parinaamon ne congress ko is baar bada jhatka nahin diya
 While those elections took away Congress from Uttarakhand, it also gave a big state like Punjab in return
 matganana ke baad paanchon rajyon main bijepi or congress kaa score tha 2-3
 Significantly, the BJP had won a majority in UP and Uttarakhand
 jabik congress ko punjab main to bahumat mila lekin manipur or goa main vah sabase badi party thi
 In two states (goa and Manipur), Congress continued to reach Bahumat
 saaf jaahir tha ki sarkaar banane ke liye jod-tod kii ganit khelni thi
 In this game, the BJP and Congress won the game and lost
 ab agar bijepi sadan main apana bahumat sabit karne main kaamyaab ho jaati he to bahumat ke kareeb pahunch kar bhi congress ko vipaksh main baithna padegaa
 Late Awakened Congress Both states woke up late
 goa main ravivaar ko manohar parrikar rajyapal se mili or apane samarthan main 22 vidhayakon kaa patr saunpa to rajyapal ne bhi unhen mukhyamantri niyukt kar 15 din ke andar floor test karne ko kaha tha
 After that, the Congress filed a petition against the Governor's decision, but there too, justifying the Governor's decision, he asked for a floor test at the earliest
 congress kaa haal kuch aisa himanipuramein bhi najar aayaa
 In Manipur, the Congress lagged behind the BJP
 bijepi pratinidhimandal ravivaar shaam rajyapal najma hepatulla se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 After this, on behalf of the Congress, Chief Minister Ibobi Singh also presented a claim to form the government there before the governor
 ab jabaki gend rajyapal ke paale main he, sabase bada dal hone ke baavjood congress manipur sarkaar banane kaa mauka khoti najar aa rahi he
 Because Manipur Governor Najma Heptullah, while addressing a press conference held at Raj Bhavan, said that the Congress has made a claim to form the government as the largest party
 magar samarthan ke daawey ko majbootee se sabit karne main kamayab nahin hue
 In fact, the Congress had also spoken of the support of the NPP mlas in their claim even though they had already expressed their support for the BJP in favor of the BJP shortly before that
 khaas baat yah he ki satta kii ladaai main bijepi ne jahaan ek ore congress main hi sendhamari kii he vahiin duusari ore apane samarthan main rajyapalon ke samaksh 32 vidhayakon kii parade bhi karwaai
 Congress MLA Shyam Kumar was also included in the parade
 ye he donon rajyon main daleey sthitigovacongress- 17bijepi- 13maharashtravaadi gomantak- 3goa forward party- 3nesanalist congress party- 1nirdaleey- 3manipurcongress- 28bijepi- 21nagaland pipuls front- 4neshnal pipuls party- 4trinmul congress- 1lok jan shakti party- 1nirdaleey- 1 Sri Lanka defeated West Indies by 57 runs in the Super Eight leg match of Group f of the Twenty20 Cricket World Cup after three wickets between Anjata Mendis and Lasith Malinga after opener Mahela Jayawardene's 98-run innings
 srilanka ne tas jitkar teen wicket par 195 ran kaa vishaal score banaaya or is lakshya ke jawaab main captain kris gail kii westeindies team nirdhaarit 20 overon main aath wicket par 138 ran hi bana saki
 Jayawardene, who scored a century against Zimbabwe, missed out on a hundred by just two runs today and hit nine fours and four sixes in his 56-ball knock
 unhone or kumaar sangakaara (49 gend main 68 ran, paanch chauke or teen chakke) ne milakar duusare wicket ke liye 166 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai
 For the West Indies, no batsman scored a big score and Ramnaresh Sarwan was the top scorer with 28 runs
 unke alaava dwen braavo ne 23 tathaa andre flechar ne 16 or jerome tailor ne naabad 16 ran banaaye
 Sri Lankan mystery spinner Mendis won the team by winning three wickets for 24 runs and Malinga by 28 runs
 nuan kulashekhara or angelo maithyuj ne ek ek wicket praapt kiya
 Earlier, the Sri Lankan team came out to bat after winning the toss, but after the early dismissal of opener Sanath Jayasuriya (06), Sangakkara scored a brilliant 49-ball 68 to lead Jayawardene
 jayasoorya ko tisare over main kemar roach ne out kiya
 Both these batsmen took advantage of several chances given by West Indies fielders, who failed to catch catches and stump many times
 srilanka ne haalanki shuruuaati do over main keval saat ran banaaye, lekin jayasoorya ke out hone ke baad sangakaara or jayavardhane ne milakar manachaahe shaat lagaaye tathaa match kii lay badal di
 In the fourth over, Jayawardene welcomed Jerome Taylor with a six over long on and a backward square
 pehali slip main khadey kris gail ne sangakaara ko jeevandaan diya, jinhone braavo ke over main do chauke jamaakar 14 ran banaaye
 Jayawardene continued his aggressive form as Suleman Benn hit the next over while Sangakkara hit the first six off Bravo in the seventh over
 donon ne gendbaajon kii dhajjiyaan udaana jari rakhaa or team ko 12wein over tak 100 ran ke paar kara diya
 In the 17th over, Jayawardene hit a six off Ben's balls and Sangakkara hit a four and put the team beyond the 150-run mark
 antim over main jayavardhane ‘naan striker’ chor par khadey rahe kyonki chamra kapugedera (06) or tillakaratne dilashaan (naabad chaar) ne ek ek chaukaa jadkar srilanka ko 200 ran ke kareeb pahunchaaya

 ravi shastri or saurav ganguli kii pratidwandvita khelpremiyon se chuphi nahin he
 This sourness came to the fore after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made Anil Kumble the coach of Team India last year
 darasal cricket kii jis salaahkaar samiti ne kumble kaa coach ke rup main chayan kiya tha, ganguli uskaa hissaa the
 This bitterness between Ravi and Ganguly came to public view after Kumble's name was finalized as coach, accusing each other of lacking professionalism
 haalanki is vivaad ke baad donon purv cricketron ne bhartiya cricket team ke 500wein test ke jashn main kanpur main saath najar aae the lekin aisa lagata he ki inke bich sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Soon after Dhoni's decision to leave the captaincy of the short format, the statement of former India team director Ravi Shastri has sparked a new controversy
 ravi shastri ne dhoni ko na sirf 'dada captain' bataaya balki ganguli ko sarvshereshth bhartiya captainon kii suchi main bhi sthaan nahin diya
 Considered to be a strong support for Dhoni, Shastri also said that the timing of this wicket-keeper batsman's decision to leave the captaincy was 'perfect'
 tippaniyan Shastri said, 'my salute to Dada Captain
 isse viraat (kohli) ko champions trophy tak samay milegaa or team apane khitaab kaa bachaav karne ke liye taiyaari kar sakegi
 He said that 'dhoni has achieved all the important victories and he does not have to prove anything now
 isliye main unhen bharat kaa sabase safal captain maanata hum
 No one else is around them in this matter
 ' team india ke purv cricketer shastri ne kaha, 'is maamle main dhoni ke peeche kapil dev hai jinke netritv main bharat ne 1983 main worldcup jeeta or 1986 main england ke khilaaf test siries jiti
 In the pre-odi era, there was Ajit (wadekar) who won consecutive Test series in 1971 in West Indies and then England
 nishchit rup se apane alag style ke kaaran tiger (pataudi) bhi hai
 No one else ' Though Shastri is free to express his opinion, Ganguly's record as the captain of Team India, his opinion will embrace cricket fans, there is doubt about it
 'dada' ke naam se lokapriy rahe saurav ne 49 test main bhartiya team captaini kii or unka jeet kaa rate 42
 6 percent
 ganguli kii captaini ne team india ne 147 maichon main se 76 main jeet hasil kii jabaki 66 main use haarana padaa
 Although Dhoni's record as a captain is better than that of his predecessor, Ganguly cannot be considered far behind
 ganguli kii ore se is maamle main abhi koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 However, after this controversy, both the former cricketers were seen together in Kanpur in celebration of the 500th Test of the Indian cricket team, but it seems that everything is not going well between them
 dhoni ke shorter formet kii captaini chhodane ke nirnay ke tunrat baad team india ke purv diarector ravi shastri ke bayaan ne ek nae vivaad ko janm de diya he
 Ravi Shastri not only described Dhoni as 'dada Captain' but also ranked Ganguly in the list of best Indian captains
 dhoni ke purajor samarthan maane jane vaale shastri ne yah bhi ki kaha ki is wicketiper ballebaaj ke captaini chhodane ke faisle kii timming 'parfect' thi
 The comments shastri ne kaha, 'dada captain ko meraa salaam
 This will give Virat (kohli) time till the Champions Trophy and the team will be ready to defend their title
 ' unhone kaha ki 'dhoni sari mahatvapurn jeeten hasil kar chuke hai or unhen ab kuch bhi sabit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 So, i consider him the most successful captain of India
 is maamle main or koi unke aasapaas bhi nahin he
 Shastri, a former Team India cricketer, said, "in this case, behind Dhoni is Kapil Dev, under whose leadership India won the World Cup in 1983 and won the Test series against England in 1986
 vanade cricket ke pehle vaale yug main ajit (wadekar) the jinhone 1971 main westeindies or phir england main lagaataar test siries jeetin
 There are also tigers (pataudi) of course due to their different style
 baaki koi nahin
 ' haalanki shastri apni raay jataane ke liye swatantra hai,lekin ganguli ke team india ke captain ke rup main record ko dekhte hue unki raay cricketpremiyon ke gale utregi, ise lekar andeh he

 ramesh ne kaha ki rajya sarkarein jab vittiya madad ke bare main centre se vikendrikaran kii baat karte hai to unhen bhi apane suubon main vikendrikaran kaa puraa puraa dhyaan dena chahie
 State should give authority to these institutions so that Panchayati Raj institutions can play a greater role

 lekin sarkaar ne aisa nahin kiya, jiske baad gilaani ko adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa notice bheja gaya
 Gilani has defended the government's decision not to open cases against Zardari on the grounds that the president is exempted from hearing criminal cases under the country's constitution

 Several new rules are going to come into force for DTH services from 1 February
 iskaa matlab ye he ki aapke tivi dekhne kaa tarika isse badal saktaa he
 At the moment it is not clear whether the new changes will increase the problem or give a better experience than before
 TRAI kaa kahana he ki nae niyam achche badlaavon ke liye laae ja rahe hai
 One of the new rules coming in will be that customers can buy their own set-top box (STB) from the market
 aise main aapako DTH seva uplabdh karaane vaali companiyaan jaise Airtel, dishtv, tatasky dwaara uplabdh karaae ja rahe STB ko upyog karne kii baadhyataa nahin hogi
 TRAI says that DTH service providers or local cable operators can no longer force customers to buy or rent stbs from them
 ab graahak apni marji se kiraye se DTH seva uplabdh karaane vaali companiyon se yaa open market se STB kharid sakate hai
 That is, in simple language, it is the same as after you take broadband, you can buy a router and modem of your choice or can also take it from the service provider
 nae niyam ke mutabik aap STB kahin se bhi le sakate hai lekin ye distributor ke tivi channelon ke liye compatible hone chahie
 a technology will be made standard since the new rules are introduced
 yani aapke DTH sarvice se STB ko compatible banane ke liye keval ek technology hogi
 However, such a rule was no longer enforced because stbs present in the market have different compression techniques, coding techniques, encryption systems, middleware and operating systems that make every STB unique
 interoparability ko lagu karne ke liye tri ke raste main ek pareshaani broadcastaron kaa virodh bhi he, jinka tark he ki nae system se tivi channelon ke signlles kii piresi badhegi
 According to toi's report, the new system could be implemented by the end of this year
 saath hi aapako bataa den nae niyam ke lagu hone ke baad bhi STB rakhane kii anivaaryta rahegi hi
 That is, now you will be able to watch TV channels only when you have STB at home
 dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne mana ki samuhik balaatkaar ke baad huye virodh pradarshan ‘ankhe kholane’ vaale the or saath hi unhone dilli police ke ‘samvedanheen’ ravaiye kii aalochana kii jiske kaaran logon kaa police main vishwaas kam hua he
 Sheila also said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should have addressed the country a little earlier than a week after the 'horrific' incident of 16 December
 unhone mana ki log police kii ore se ‘pareshaan’ kiye jane ke bare main soch kar mushkil main fanse logon kii madad karne se ‘kataraate’ hai
 He asked the police to change his attitude and style
 unka maananaa he ki jarurat ke vakt pulicekarmiyon ko ‘sajjan’ kii tarah pesh aana chaiye
 The Chief Minister said in an interview to a private channel, 'I worry about it
 haa, mujhe is baat se chintaa hoti he ki police bal utani samvedansheel yaa jimmedaar or utani shisht nahin he, jitna use hona chaiye
 There is a need for a change in the system and there is a need for a change in the judicial system and bureaucratic system as well, but it should be thought through
 lekin yah dhyaan main rakhen ki yah kal hi nahin hoga
 'sheila said,' Khot is in the police
 mujhe nahin maaloom
 i do not swallow my words while explaining this flaw
 vastav main, maine khullam-khulla nahin lekin chhipe taur par iskaa virodh kiya he
 When asked about the responsibility of the incident, he said, "it is not my job to appoint or remove the Commissioner of Police
" yah grih mantralay kaa kaam he or mujhe bharosa he ki ve kuch karenge
 The Chief Minister dismissed the fact that the government did not take immediate action to control the situation and said that it showed great speed in setting up fast track courts and forming a Justice JS Verma committee
 yah puche jane par ki kya pradhanmantri kaa desh ko sambodhan der se aayaa, unhone kaha, ‘shaayad ek haftaa kaaphi der thi
 Perhaps they should have done this earlier
 ’shila ne yah bhi mana ki ativishisht logon kii suraksha main lage atyadhik logon ko hataaya janaa chaiye
 He said, 'I can tell you about myself, i don't need this kind of protection
 kyon?
 The Chief Minister told that his government is going to start an awareness campaign called 'raise your voice, do contemplation'

 Some reasons are working behind increasing interest and skepticism about the cabinet
 masalan,amit shah sanghathan main yaa sarkaar main?sabase pehle to sabko ye jaanane kii utsukata he ki amit shah sanghathan main hi rahenge yaa sarkaar se judenge
 The Cabinet Committee of Security is another matter of interest, how will the Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS) form in the cabinet? Whether JDU will join the government or not? Thirdly, the last time Janata Dal United (JDU) is supporting the government from outside Was it, then this time will it participate in its government or not? Stake in the cabinet of Bengal, Odisha and Bihar, BJP this time in Lok Sabha elections There have been unexpected successes in West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar

 Talking about the appearance of CCS, it completely depends on the future role of Amit Shah
 agar amit shah ko sarkaar main laane kaa faisla liya jaataa he, to swaroop nishchit taur par badalegaa

 nagesh ne echdi kumaraswami kii aguwai main chal rahi gathbandhan sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya he or iske saath hi unhone mantri pad se istipha de diya
 The crisis has deepened on the state government due to this new development
 udhar congress ke saansadon ne sansad main bhi is mudde ko jor shor se uthaaya he
 The Congress is alleging that the Modi government is trying to destabilize the state government and is using the Raj Bhavan for this
 vahiin dipti siem ji parameshwara ne kaha he ki agar jarurat padi to congress ke sabhi mantri istipha de denge or unki jagah par naaraaz vidhayakon ko mantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 For the moment, what will be seen is how much the MLA who has submitted his resignation to the governor listens
 lekin is nae ghatnakram se itar agar ham peeche jaaen to pataa chalegaa ki jabase rajya main congress or jedies gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani he vah lagaataar chhichakole kha rahi he
 In the 2018 elections, BJP emerged as the largest party in the state and got 104 seats
 lekin vah bahumat se 10 siten peeche rah gai
 The Congress, led by the then CM Siddaramaiah, won 78 and the JDS got 38 seats
 khaas baat yah he ki rajya main teenon ne hi alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 After this, being a big party, bjp's BS Yeddyurappa gave an opportunity to form the government, he also took the oath of Chief Minister
 kai dinon tak chale naatakeey ghatnakram ke baad jisamen congress ko apane vidhayakon ko hotel tak main band karnaa padaa, ke baad bijepi ko bahumat kaa aankada nahin juta pai or vidhansabha main bina shakti pareekshan ke hi siem pad se istipha de diya
 After this, under another important development in the state, Congress and JDS announced to form a government together
 donon kii siten milakar bahumat ke jaruri aankade se zyada thim
 The Congress announced its decision to make JDS leader Kumaraswamy the CM, leaving the claim of CM post
 yah ek bada ghatnakram tha jise congress ke liye raajnneetik sanjivani mana gaya kyonki kumaraswami kaa shapathgrahan vipakshi ekta kaa bhi manch ban gaya tha
 Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, Mamta Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and all the stalwarts of the opposition had reached to participate in this program
 sarkaar banane ke baad kuch din tak to sab thik tha lekin andar hi andar mantrimandal ke bantwaare or dipti siem pad ke liye khinchataan jari thi
 Many senior Congress leaders considered themselves neglected
 isi bich kai muddon par matbhed khulkar saamne aane lage or kumaraswami ne rahul gandhi se milakar congress netaaon ko samajhane ke liye kaha
 But the situation did not go away and one day CM Kumaraswamy cried on the public stage saying, 'you are standing with a bouquet to honor me, because your brother has become CM and you are all happy, but i am not
 mujhe gathbandhan sarkaar kaa dard pataa he
 i became virulent and swallowed the pain of this government
 ' # WATCH: Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy breaks down at an event in Bengaluru; says 'you are standing with bouquets to wish me, as one of your brother became CM & you all are happy, but I'm not
 i know the pain of coalition govt
 i became Vishkanth&swallowed pain of this govt' (14

 com / cq8f90kkft The government was boiling inside but somehow it was running
 iske baad loksabhaa chunaav aayaa or donon partiyon ke gathbandhan par phir ek sankat aa gaya
 CM Kumaraswamy was angry with the attitude of Congress as Congress leaders were now threatening to bring down his government
 is par kumaraswami ne khule manch par congress se kaha ki vah jedies ke saath chauthe darje ke chaparasi kii tarah na pesh aae
 Not only this, Kumaraswamy's tears once again came out during the campaign on stage
 is baar unhone kaha, har roj media main kaha ja rahaa he ki kal main chalaa jaaunga (siem ke pad se)
 But with the results of the Lok Sabha elections, all the effort was done
 rajya kii 28 siton main bijepi ne 25 siten jeet leen or ek seat bhi uske samarthan se pratyaashee jiti
 The congress-jds alliance got only 2 seats

So they said that this will not happen and they will take out the journey as planned
 unase jab poocha ki un par yah aarope lag rahe hai ki unhone sardaar patel group ke soshal media incharge ke taur par sirf apane aapako hi bhunaaya, to unhone jalaab diya, kabaliyat thi isliye ve aisa kar paae lekin unhone duusare sabhi logon ko bhi mahatv dene kii koshish kii

 In the case of Sunanda Pushkar's death, the police also used psychological methods to answer questions during the first interrogation of Shashi Tharoor
 darasal, dilli police kii esaiti ne poochtacha ke liye kai tareeke se taiyaariyaan kin, or third degree ke liye 'mashhoor' police tharur ko manovaigyanik tareeke se gherna chaahati he
 The episode has started and the police has already questioned Tharoor in the first round
 maamle se jude police sutron ke mutabik tharur se poochtacha ke liye dakshin jile ke anti-auto theft squad ke vasant vihaar sthit puraane offis ko chunaa gaya
 In fact, the police felt that Tharoor could be subjected to psychological pressure for questioning here
 darasal kaaphi arase se khaali pade is offis ko dekhne par yah filmon main dikhaai dene vaale third degree room jaisaa hi dikhataa he
 Apart from this, SIT officials involved in the questioning questioned Tharoor for four hours continuously, and meanwhile, the police officers looked into Tharoor's face and eyes

 madhya pradeshmen solar pump ab kisaanon kii jindagi main badlaav laa rahe hai
 These pumps, being installed under the Chief Minister Solar Pump Scheme, have not only overcome the power problem of the farmers, but have also given them an opportunity to plant crops according to their wish
 abhi tak kisaan bijli kii samasya kii vajah se aisi fasalein lagane se bachate the, jisamen pani kii zyada jarurat hoti thi
 The 64-year-old nafees-ur-rehman has installed a solar pump under the Chief Minister Solar Pump Scheme in Dahod village of Raisen district, about 30 km from Bhopal
 takreeban 35 acre jameen ke maalik nafis ke parivaar main 7 log hai or ve puri tarah se apane parivaar ke guzar-basar ke liye kheti par hi nirbhar hai
 "earlier we used to get electricity for 6-8 hours on cold days, but after installing the pump we used to get it from 9 am to 5 am and 7 in the summer days
 30 se lekar shaam 6 baje tak pump ke jariye pani le lete hai
 "they say," it has relieved the farmers of a big problem
 agar ise sahi tarah se har jagah lagaaya jaae to kisaanon kii jindagi hi badal jaaegi
 "nafees plant wheat, paddy, onion and garlic throughout the year
 dikkat bijli kii thi jo ab takreeban khatm ho gai he
 Rahman pumped this pump for around 75,000
 main lagavaaya he
 By the way, its original price is around 4 lakhs
 he
 Seeing them, many people in the village have applied to get this pump installed
 garmi ke dinon main kisaanon ke liye ek samasya yah bhi rahati thi ki bijli vibhaag hi bijli ko feader se kaat detaa tha
 He argues that there is a risk of fire in summer
 iske chalate ek taraf kisaan vaise hi pani kii kami kaa saamana karata he, duusari taraf na ke baraabar bijli milane se uski haalat or bighad jaati he
 Rahman explains that this pump gives good water throughout the day in strong sunlight
 unhen santosh he ki ise lagane main unhen kisi bhi tarah kii pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa, varanaa kisi bhi sarkari yojana ke tahat koi cheez, vah bhi jisamen anudaan mil rahaa ho, milanaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Mahesh Kumar is also a farmer like Rahman
 mahesh kumaar ke 11 sadasyon vaale parivaar ke paas 7 acre jameen he
 Mahesh has been planting wheat, gram and paddy every year
 ve kehete hai, ''pehle hamaare paas bijli hi nahin thi
 When people used to go to the electricity department office, they used to return it
 dijal pump se nahar se pani lekar sinchai karte the
 '' But Mahesh Kumar's water problem is over now
 mahesh ko 5 horse power kaa pump lagane main lagbhag 72,000 ru
 Has come at a cost of Rs
 in panpon kii safalataa ke baad ab duusare kisaan bhi iskaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate hai
 Solar pumps ranging from 1 horsepower to 10 horsepower are provided under this scheme
 isamen sarkaar 85 pratishat se lekar 90 pratishat tak anudaan detii he
 Through this, where dependence on conventional energy is reducing, farmers are getting plenty of electricity during the day
 solar pump puri tarah paryaavaran hitaishi hai
 There is no loss of any kind from this
 vahi kisaanon ke liye isko lagaana or istemaal karnaa aasaan he
 Interested farmers have to apply to install this pump
 uske baad sarkaar urja vikaas nigam ke jariye isko lagavati he
 The Energy Development Corporation has selected 6 companies through tenders which are providing pumps to farmers
 shakti pamps ke adhikari giriraaj bataate hai, ''isane kisaanon kii jindagi ko sahi myanon main aasaan bana diya he
 The farmers no longer have to wait
 ve din main pump chalaa kar sinchai ke kaam se mukt ho jate hai
 The first 8 hours of electricity was available and the time was not fixed
 ''shakti pump ne remote monitering system ke jariye aisa sarwar banaaya he ki kisi bhi kism kii samasya aane kii sthiti main ve fouran kisaan kii madad kar sakate hai or gadabadi ko vahiin se thik kar dete hai
 On the other hand, the company has created an app that allows the farmer to run his pump from anywhere through Android phones
 iske liye bas solar pump vaali jagah or khud vah jahaan par maujuud he, us jagah par mobile kaa signal milanaa chahie
 Giriraj says that in a state like Madhya Pradesh, there will be only 15 days in 365 days every year when the sun does not come out
 barish ke dinon main is pump kii kshamta kam ho jaati he kyonki yah pump saura urja kaa istemaal karata he
 But in those days, farmers do not need it due to rain
 solar pump lagavane ke baad kisaanon kaa sinchai par kharch shunya ho jaataa he
 If they have to store electricity, then it requires batteries and it also costs more, but there is no such requirement in solar pumps
 urja vikaas nigam ke prabandh sanchaalak manu shrivastav kehete hai, ''ise kisaan bahut pasand kar rahe hai
 We are providing irrigation to farmers in places where there is no electricity
 agar sarkaar vahaan par bijli pahunchaana bhi chaahati he to use bahut zyada kharchaa aayega
 This scheme is also reducing the burden on the government, '' the Energy Development Corporation can monitor it through a complete monitoring system
 vahiin isamen rakrakhaav kii 5 saal kii jimmedaari company kii he
 Apart from this, these pumps are also being insured for 5 years
 shrivastav bataate hai ki is yojana kii koshish yahi he ki sarkaar zyada se zyada kisaanon kii sinchai main madad kar sake
 In Madhya Pradesh, the rate of pumps fixed after the tender is the lowest in the country
 pradesh main yah rate bharat sarkaar dwaara tay rate se bhi kam he
 The real-time monitoring of the pumps that the Pump Energy Development Corporation is installing can be done from anywhere in the world
 pradesh main ab tak 7,000 pump lagaae ja chuke hai
 Its target was to install 9,000 pumps but due to the very good work in the state, this target has been increased
 sarkaar ko kisaanon ko bijli anudaan ke taur par pani ke pump kaa istemaal karne ke liye har saal arabon rupye dene padate hai
 Now, the government will also save a lot from the use of these pumps
 madhya pradesh jaise rajyon main pani ke solar pump kaa istemaal isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki pichley kai saal main pradesh krishi utpaadan main record bana rahaa he
 Overall, this scheme is proving to be a boon for farmers
 *** There was a clear difference in giving a final salute to the soldiers who were martyred in the Udhampur attack
 consteble rocky ke antim sanskaar main sarkaar kii ore se koi mantri nahin pahunchaa, jabaki shubhendu roy ko khud siem mamata banerjee ne aakhri vidaai di
 At the funeral of martyr Jawan Rocky, who saved the lives of 44 soldiers in the attack, neither the Central Government nor any Minister of Haryana Government bothered to pay the last farewell to the martyr
 BSF ke DG jis shahid jawan kii shahadatki kahani ko bade garv se bataate rahe, usee jawan rocky ke antim sanskaar main jane kii kisi mantri ko fursat nahin mili
 The martyr Rocky, who took the lone battle with the terrorists, was given a final farewell in the village in Yamunanagar
 lekin is maukey par sthaneey vidhayak ke alaava koi maujuud nahin tha
 On the other hand, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee herself was present when the body of another soldier Shubhendu Roy, who was martyred in the Udhampur attack, was brought from Delhi to Bagdogra Airport
 unhone shahid shubhendu kii veerta ko salaam kiya
 Let us tell you that Martyr Rocky alone saved 44 lives on his own
 lekin usee shahid ko salaam karne ke liye na centre, na rajya sarkaar kisi ke mantri ko vakt mila
 Perhaps that's why Raki's family is angry today
 sawaal uthta he ki shahid-shahid main fark kyon kiya gaya? agar mamata banerjee shahid shubhendu ko sammaan dene ja sakati hai, to haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter shahid ko antim vidaai dene kaa vakt kyon nahin nikaal sake? agar siem sahab kisi duusare kaam main vyast bhi the, to sarkaar ke kisi duusare mantri ko antim sanskaar main shaamil hone ke nirdesh kyon nahin die gaye? ye kisi shahid kii shahadat kaa apmaan nahin he, to or kya he?

 Not a word has come out of the government's mouth
 tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar kaa jo ravaiya he, usamen wo rakshak to katai nazar nahin aate, aisa kaam to rakshas hi kar sakate hai
 Manoj Tiwari expressed his anger to Kejriwal in front of the media and said that the Kejriwal government in Delhi is only wooing people by taking political gains
 aam log suvidhaon ke abhaav main maare ja rahe hai
 Tiwari alleged that several night shelters, where the locks are hanging and the homeless people are forced to spend the night under the free shelter on the streets
 kejariwal or unki party garibon kii bhalaai ke liye kaam karne kaa daawa karti he, lekin satta main aane ke baad bemaut maare ja rahe logon ke prati munh kholane ke liye bhi taiyaar nahin he
 Tiwari alleged that Kejriwal also distorted the statement made in his Max Hospital case and used it for political advantage
 tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal bataaen ki unhone kab maiks aspataal ke license ko behaal karne kii maang unase kii thi yaa iske liye unke ghar ke saamne dharna diya tha, lekin unke bayaan ko tod marodkar isse raajnneeti karne main wo peeche nahin rahe
 Tiwari clarified that he had only raised the issue of unemployed employees of the hospital and asked what would happen to the patients who are being treated in the hospital? unhone chunauti di he ki kejariwal ye bharosa dilaaein ki maiks kaa license kisi bhi tarah se behaal nahin hoga, kyonki agar aisa hua to ye saaf ho jayega ki dilli sarkaar kii santhganth he or karrwai sirf dikhaave ke liye kii gai thi

 If you want to be a leader in India, then you don't have to care about two things
 kyonki hamaari janata un do chizon ke bare main kabhi aapse sawaal nahin karegi
 These two things are health and education
 donon ke ghatiya str ke kaaran hamaari or aapaki zindagi kis had tak barbaad he, ham iskaa hisaab to rakhte hai, magar netaaon se iskaa hisaab nahin maangate
 Therefore, to become a leader in India, one thing has to come, that is the shame of lying
 agar aap is raste chalenge to yakeen maniye aap netaa ban jaaenge
 Education and health questions are not there today
 dukh kii baat he ki na kal ke the na aaj ke hai
 You are aware that Union Health Minister JP Nadda has released a National Health Profile of 2018

 The white building that our colleague Kanhaiya's camera is moving towards has been defined in government documents as an additional primary health center
 iskaa ek pataa he zila saharsa, sadar prakhand kehara kaa basuna gaanv
 The nurse is seen sitting in front
 unhen dekhakar bharosa kar sakate hai ki inkaa duty naam kii chiz main aaj bhi bharosa he
 This building, built in 2007, will soon assure you that our contractors and officers have arranged so much of your money that no building lasts for more than a decade
 deevaaron kaa saath chhod cement ke tukade hawaaon ke saath yahaan se bhaag liye hai
 Despite all the possibilities of falling, this building has not fallen yet, this is the only good news in this mismanagement
 doctoron ke liye jo shauchalay he usamen davaaiyaan bikhri padi hai
 Health department posters are scattered on the ground to make the patients aware
 maine kaha na ki aap in sab sawaalon ke bina bhi netaa ban sakate hai

 Even if the doctor came for two days, you could not see the condition of the building
 doctor aate bhi honge to bhi imaarat kaa yahi haal rahata, kyonki imaarat thik rakhana doctor kaa kaam nahin he
 Nurses definitely come to attend
 is centre par haal philhal main koi homeopathic doctor aayaa he
 You will miss a good reporter by seeing the situation that people have told from inside this health center
 yahaan ke logon ne saharsa ke siemo yani mukhya chikitsa padaadhikari ko patr bhi likhaa he ki gaanv se 10 kimi dur saharsa janaa padataa he aspataal ke liye
 20 years ago, there was all kinds of facilities here, but now there is nothing
 kai baar patr likhaa gaya he magar utani hi baar adhikariyon ne andekha kar yah sabit kiya he ki unka koi kuch nahin bigaad saktaa he
 Like the villagers, we also realize this, since they have written letters so many times, we too show it once
 gaanv ke logon ne anshan bhi kiya he aisa is patr se pataa chalata he
 It also shows that not only the intellectuals of Delhi have taken up the contract of democracy, but the villagers have also taken up the task, but Delhi and Saharsa are all the same in front of the contractors of the system
 nurse padamavati ne kaha ki is centre se ab sirf aayran or calcium kii goli baantne ke alaava koi kaam nahin nahin hota na suvidha he

 Education and health questions are not there today
 dukh kii baat he ki na kal ke the na aaj ke hai
 You are aware that Union Health Minister JP Nadda has released a National Health Profile of 2018
 isamen bharat kii ghatiya swasthya vyavastha ke bare main jaankaree he
 National health profile is being created since 2005, yet there is no significant improvement
 ham is par bhi baat karenge magar pehle aapako bihar ke ek swasthya kend kii haalat bataate hai
 The white building that our colleague Kanhaiya's camera is moving towards has been defined in government documents as an additional primary health center
 iskaa ek pataa he zila saharsa, sadar prakhand kehara kaa basuna gaanv
 The nurse is seen sitting in front
 unhen dekhakar bharosa kar sakate hai ki inkaa duty naam kii chiz main aaj bhi bharosa he
 This building, built in 2007, will soon assure you that our contractors and officers have arranged so much of your money that no building lasts for more than a decade
 deevaaron kaa saath chhod cement ke tukade hawaaon ke saath yahaan se bhaag liye hai
 Despite all the possibilities of falling, this building has not fallen yet, this is the only good news in this mismanagement
 doctoron ke liye jo shauchalay he usamen davaaiyaan bikhri padi hai
 Health department posters are scattered on the ground to make the patients aware
 maine kaha na ki aap in sab sawaalon ke bina bhi netaa ban sakate hai
 Just lie and the people have to fight in the name of Hindu Muslim
 aaj kii raat ise aap thik se nihaar lijie magar apni raajnneetik nishtha ko mat badaliega
 He is the shroud of us people, he has to live while he is alive and even after he dies
 ek baar yah kafan utar gaya to aapke sharir se lipta netaaon kaa jhooth cement kii tarah yahaan kii deevaaron ko chhod hawaaon ke saath bhaag jaaenge
 The building you saw was built in 2007
 paanch chah panchayat ke hazaron logon kii praathmik zarurat isi atirikt praathmik swasthya kend ke bharose he
 The villagers collected donations and arranged chair chairs and other equipment for Dagadar Saheb to sit
 yahaan saptaah main do baar doctor or nurse kii duty tay hui magar do din kahaan koi aata he
 Even if the doctor came for two days, you could not see the condition of the building
 doctor aate bhi honge to bhi imaarat kaa yahi haal rahata, kyonki imaarat thik rakhana doctor kaa kaam nahin he
 Nurses definitely come to attend
 is centre par haal philhal main koi homeopathic doctor aayaa he
 You will miss a good reporter by seeing the situation that people have told from inside this health center
 yahaan ke logon ne saharsa ke siemo yani mukhya chikitsa padaadhikari ko patr bhi likhaa he ki gaanv se 10 kimi dur saharsa janaa padataa he aspataal ke liye
 20 years ago, there was all kinds of facilities here, but now there is nothing
 kai baar patr likhaa gaya he magar utani hi baar adhikariyon ne andekha kar yah sabit kiya he ki unka koi kuch nahin bigaad saktaa he
 Like the villagers, we also realize this, since they have written letters so many times, we too show it once
 gaanv ke logon ne anshan bhi kiya he aisa is patr se pataa chalata he
 It also shows that not only the intellectuals of Delhi have taken up the contract of democracy, but the villagers have also taken up the task, but Delhi and Saharsa are all the same in front of the contractors of the system
 nurse padamavati ne kaha ki is centre se ab sirf aayran or calcium kii goli baantne ke alaava koi kaam nahin nahin hota na suvidha he

 Madhya Pradesh has one doctor for 16,996 people
 jharkhand main 18,518 logon par ek doctor he
 Hindi speaking regions are in a very bad condition

 AIIMS does not have 70 per cent teachers, so think that the child who is selected after passing the tough competition of AIIMS reads from whom, from ghosts or from ghosts
 aspataal nahin hai doctor nahin hai, garib or saadhaaran or thik thaak aamadani vaale log bhi ilaaj karaate karaate karz main aa jate hai
 House is being sold

 The average expenditure on hospitalization in India is 26,455 thousand

 Once admitted to Assam, the sick spends 52 thousand

 In Assam, two sound engineers living there were mistaken and killed by the people, because there were many rumors about child theft on whatsapp
 assam ke karabi anglang zile main nilotpal or abhijit ke insaaf ke liye fasebuk main ek group bhi bana he jise 6 xxrep 4 0 se adhik log follow kar rahe hai
 On 8 June, Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath were returning from a picnic, but a crowd stopped their jeeps in Panjuri and started hitting them
 donon assam ke hi rahane vaale the to ahomia main bhi logo se kaha ki ve baccha chor nahin hai, lekin bheed ne donon ko maar diya
 Many people have been detained and this is a big issue in Assam
 is ghatana ke thik pehle hyderabad police ne alert jari kiya tha ki soshal media main baccha chori gang ko lekar afvaah udayi ja rahi he, jisaki vajah se alag-alag jagahon par teen logon ko bheed ne gher kar maar diya

 Ten people were beaten up with trees tied to electric poles

 Once the mob is allowed to take the law and kill it, then it is not only the Muslim but also the Hindu who is surrounded and killed

 a similar rumor broke out in Jharkhand in 2017 of a toddler theft gang
 haldi pokhar se rajnagar ja rahe naeem, sajju, shiraj or haleem ko sau se bhi adhik logon ne gher liya or itnaa maaraa ki naeem, sajju or shiraj kii maut ho gai

 65-year-old Samyuddin was injured

 In the FIR report, the family of Samyuddin did not mention cow slaughter
 police kaa kahana he ko motor cycle ke raste ko lekar jhagada ho gaya tha
 However, the police is investigating whether the rumor about cow slaughter was spread or not

 police kaa kahana he ki tasviir uske pahunchane ke baad kii he
 The victim did not have an ambulance to take her to the hospital

 The police admitted that his colleagues should have been more sensitive

 Recently, two such incidents have also been reported from Jharkhand

 The primary needs of thousands of people of five to six panchayats are dependent on this additional primary health center
 gaanv waalon ne chanda jamaa kar dagdar sahab ke baithne ke liye kursi teble or anya upkarnon kaa intazaam kiya
 Here, the duty of doctor and nurse was fixed twice a week, but where does anyone come for two days
 do din bhi doctor aate to aap imaarat kii wo haal nahin dekh pate
 Even if the doctors would come, the same condition of the building would remain, because it is not the doctor's job to keep the building right
 nurse zarur haaziri lagane aa jaati hai
 Recently a homeopathic doctor has visited this center
 logon ne is swasthya centre ke bheetar se jo haal bataaya he use dekhakar aapako kisi achche reporter kii yaad aegi
 People here have also written a letter to the CMO of Saharsa i
e
 Chief Medical Officer that one has to go to Saharsa, 10 km from the village, for the hospital
 20 saal pehle yahaan har tarah kii suvidha thi magar ab kuch nahin he
 Many times the letter has been written, but the same number of times the officers have ignored it and proved that nothing can spoil them
 gaanv waalon kii tarah hamen bhi iskaa ahsaas he, chunki unhone kai baar patr likhe hai to ham bhi ek baar dikhaa dete hai
 The people of the village have also fasted, this letter shows
 yah bhi pataa chalata he ki loktantr kaa theka sirf dilli ke buddijivi hi nahin gaanv waalon ne bhi uthaa rakhaa he magar tantra ke thekedaaron ke saamne dilli or saharsa sab ek samaan hai

 tippaniyan On the other hand, when Tanvi Seth went to the Passport Office, the officer Vikas Mishra present there asked him to change the name and religion, because he married a Muslim
 unhone videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko twit kar diya
 The couple from Noida married their choice, but what right did the passport officer have to intervene and say that the passport would not be made because you married a Muslim
 tanvi seth ne likhaa he ki adhikari ne unke saath karaab tareeke se baat kii or apmaan kiya
 Tanvi Seth took care of both her privacy and her citizenship and tweeted heavily to Sushma Swaraj that what is happening
 yahi nahin vikaas mishra ne anas siddiki se bhi kaha ki ve apana naam or mazahab badal len
 He said that either one has to change his name and religion
 sushamaa swaraj ne bhi apana sanvaidhanik daayitv nibhaayaa or us afasar kaa tabadalaa ho gaya
 Tanvi and Anas's passports were also made
 anas or tanvi kii shaadi 2007 main hui thi or ek beti bhi he
 We know how this poison reached the minds of officers like Vikas Mishra

 The names of beef, Bangladesh and Pakistan are taken as infallible weapons
 amit shah ne pakistan kaa naam kya liya, bihar bijepi ke netaa pakistan-pakistan karne lage hai
 By the way, Bangladesh's weapon used to be more in electoral work, but now it seems that Bhotra has been done

 wo baitha-baitha soch rahaa hoga ki hamaara naam lekar hindustan main koi party chunaav bhi jeet sakati he
 Pakistan should be congratulated after BJP wins
 mubarak ho, aap hamaara naam lekar jeet gaye! When Ramadan started in the month of June, Prime Minister Modi called Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and congratulated Ramadan and released Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails as a good sign
 diwali ke maukey par bharat ke pradhanmantri ko aagrah karnaa chahie ki pakistan or bangladesh main diwali ke din chuttee honi chahie
 By doing this, indo-pak or indo-bangladesh relations will be further enhanced
 mujhe pataa nahin, bangladesh ke daure par gaye pradhanmantri modi ne aisi koi maang kii thi yaa nahin
 On the day of Diwali, Amit Shah's statement should not cause moral hazard to Pakistani Hindus that we are leaving firecrackers here and BJP is suspecting us of not winning there
 kahin pakistan ko yah kehane kaa mauka na mil jaae ki dekhie bihar main galati se bijepi ke haarane par hamaare hindu diwali manaa rahe hai
 By the way, the claim is for the BJP to win
 unke liye bijepi ek zaruri party ho sakati he kyonki pakistan or bangladesh ke hinduon ke liye ladane kaa daawa bijepi hi mukhar rup se karti he
 How active is the BJP government about Hindu bloggers being killed in Bangladesh, you should google
 bijepi ko haarana nahin chahie varna haarane par hindustan main pataakhe chhodane vaale sabhi log bhi shaq ke daayre main aa sakate hai ki kahin ve pakistaniyon kii tarah khush to nahin hai
 It is obvious that childishness is reflected in the statements being made about Pakistan
 bijepi ke in bayanon se diwali ke din pataakhe phodne vaale donon mulkon ke hindu funs sakate hai
 By the way, no one should give up crackers
 isse sirf pradooshan failata he, lekin pataakhe sabhi dharm ke log phodte hai
 If i write on who brought ammo for fireworks, then people will rush to ban firecrackers for religious reasons
 bijepi pakistan kaa naam lekar pakistan ko daraa rahi he to uskaa sambandh bihar chunaav se kaise he
 For him, the government sitting in Delhi is enough
 amit shah kehete hai ki bihar chunaav kaa asar modi sarkaar par nahin padegaa
 When the election here is not going to affect the government here, what will be the difference to Pakistan
 padegaa to ham kyon chintit hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections, when BJP leader Giriraj Singh had asked those who prevented Modi to go to Pakistan, then he was alone in the BJP with this statement
 google kiya to pataa chalaa ki bijepi adhyaksh ke naate rajnath singh ne unase sakht etraz jataayaa tha or susheel modi ne unke is bayaan ko gair zimmedaar bataaya tha
 Now within a year, the BJP President is making statements from Pakistan and the same Sushil Modi is saying that if lalu-nitish wins, he will make Bihar Pakistan
 kya centre main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke rahete koi himmat kar saktaa he ki desh ke kisi hisse ko pakistan bana de
 Can a Chief Minister of any state of India make Pakistan
 susheel modi ne poocha he ki nitish kumaar bataaen ki ve teen saal pehle pakistan kyon gaye the
 Will this question one day also go to the door of Atalji and Advaniji to explain why they went to Pakistan
 kya susheel modi apane in sawaalon ko pradhanmantri kii taraf mode denge ki ve bataaen ki shapath grahan ke din pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko kyon bulaayaa tha
 Giriraj Singh says that Jinnah's jinn have entered into lalu-nitish
 adwaniji ne jinna ko secular bataa diya tha
 He is still in the BJP by resigning from his post
 bihar ke chunaav ko dharmik rashtriyata ke mudde ke sahare modaa ja rahaa he
 Whether it is folded or not, it will be known on November 8
 tippaniyan There should be a place of logic in politics
 pakistan hamaare liye kab padosi ho jaataa he, kab hone vaala dost ho jaataa he or kab aatankwaad se lekar bhartiya musalamaanon kii nishtha par sawaal karne kaa mauka ban jaataa he, yah sab kisi party kii chunavi sambhaavna par zyaada nirbhar karata he
 There used to be a war-like atmosphere between India and Pakistan over cricket, but that war has happened so many times that no one is bothered that the two countries are not able to play with each other
 vahi haal raajnneeti main pakistan kaa hone vaala he
 Pakistan's issue has been missed
 bihar main jo jite, vahaan sabaki haar he
 This time the election was settled on ghosts and Pakistan, beef only
 haa, bihar ke chunaav main pakistan zarur jeet gaya he
 He must have been sitting and thinking that any party in India can win elections by taking our name
 bijepi ke jeetne ke baad pakistan ko badhai deni chahie
 Congratulations, you won with our name! amit shah ke bayaan se diwali ke din pakistani hinduon ko naitik sankat na ho jaae ki ham yahaan pataakhe chhod rahe hai or vahaan bijepi nahin jeetne par ham par shaq kar rahi he
 Somewhere Pakistan does not get a chance to say that see our Hindus are celebrating Diwali after the BJP lost by mistake in Bihar
 vaise daawa to bijepi ke hi jeetne kaa he
 The BJP can be an important party for them as the BJP claims to fight for the Hindus of Pakistan and Bangladesh
 bangladesh main maare ja rahe hindu blogaron ko lekar bijepi sarkaar kitni sakriy he, aapako google karnaa chahie
 BJP should not lose or else all those who give up firecrackers in India can fall under suspicion that they are not happy like Pakistanis
 zaahir he pakistan ko lekar diye ja rahe bayanon main bachapanaa jhalak rahaa he
 These statements of the BJP may trap Hindus of both the countries who burst firecrackers on Diwali
 vaise kisi ko pataakhe nahin chhodane chahie
 It only spreads pollution, but firecrackers of all religions burst
 aatishbaazi ke liye barood koun lekar aayaa, is par likhuunga to log pataakhon par dharmik kaarnon se bain lagane ke liye daud padenge
 If BJP is scaring Pakistan with the name of Pakistan then how is it related to Bihar elections
 uske liye to uski dilli main baithi sarkaar hi kaaphi he

 Congratulations, you won with our name! jharkhand ke bokaron jile main naksaliyon ne centre kolfield limited (sisiel) ke 30 vaahan phoonk die
 Police said on Saturday that all the vehicles were associated with mining operations
 jharkhand ke 24 main se 18 jile naksal prabhavit hai
 Over 100 Naxalites stormed the CCL site late Friday night in Bermo area of bokaro district, 130 km from Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand
 naksaliyon ne kaarysthal par maujuud surakshakarmiyon ko daraa dhamka kar vahaan se bhaga diya or vaahanon main aag laga di
 The police have started a campaign to catch the Naxalites who carried out the incident
 input: ieenes Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav scolded his Jat bhai Yadavs in Darbhanga on April 23, “ahir (traditional name of Yadavs) has killed a lot of people, Ahir improves with his brother
 ” vahaan agle din hi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii raily hone vaali thi
 Yadav is the largest caste in numbers in the state with about 15 per cent of the population and Lalu knows that Narendra Modi is also trying his best to force them
 lalu is baar yadavon ko jhidki pilaane kii jurrat kar sakate hai kyonki unhen pataa he ki unke jaat bhai is baar puri tarah unke saath hai
 Yadav was telling them in a way that if Namo gets swept away in the air then you will never see your man reaching up in Delhi
 unke yah kehete hi ki “har har modi, gadabad modi ho jayega”, chaaron ore thahaake gunj uthe
 a day later when Modi reached Darbhanga, he refrained from referring to Dwarka and Lord Krishna, who had been doing this to woo the Yadavs in every gathering in Bihar
 aakhir, modi or bijepi ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki yadav birdari phir se lalu se jud gai he
 This trend has given a new impetus to Lalu
 28 april ko patni rabari devi ke liye saaran main prachaar ke dauraan unhone argedy ke purv vidhaan parishad sadsy or vafaadaar sahyogi anawaar ahamed se kaha ki unheen par dhyaan do, jinke argedy ko vot dene kii sambhaavna nahin he, “apane log to vot de hi rahe hai
 With such a trend among the Yadavs, with Muslims leaning towards Nitish Kumar's JD (U) to rjd-congress nexus, the much-talked-about "triangular contest" in Bihar is now turning into a clash between Lalu versus Modi
 nitish tasviir se puri tarah baahar hai
 a top BJP strategist says, "lalu Prasad is not at the top of Bihar's politics, but has definitely reached the second position in these elections
 ” beshak yah lalu ke liye baari badhat hi kahi jaaegi kyonki ve 2005 or 2010 ke vidhansabha or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main lagaataar haar se nepathy main chale gaye the
 Due to this, there is some nervousness among the leaders of Bihar BJP as they were still confident that they had performed well in the voting for 13 seats in the first two phases on April 10 and 17
 lekin 24 april ko tisare charan main saat siton ke liye hui voting main halaat badal gaye
 There is a sufficient number of Muslims in all these seats
 ummid he ki ve lalu ke saath jaaenge, or yah nirnaayak ho saktaa he
 The BJP has held four seats in Bhagalpur, Araria, Katihar and Purnia, but the party strategists in Patna privately believe that this time the situation may not be maintained in 2009
 unke mutabik, pehle nitish kii vajah se lalu ke yadav-musalmaan aadhaar main daraar paidaa karnaa sambhav ho paaya tha
 They show Lalu an electoral edge, giving 50 per cent of the total votes
 kuch maanate hai ki yah aisi badhat he jo kathith modi lahar main kam hoti nahin lagati
 Lalu is fully confident of his return, Chief Minister Nitish's weakness and his ability to counter Modi's air in the Hindi state
 ve kehete hai, “nitish to gaya! ab muqabla modi or mere bich he
 Will see on 16 May
 ”lalu kaa yah aatmavishvaas chunavi ganit se milane vaale ishaaron se aata he
 Nitish Kumar may drown the Brahmin, Kayastha, Rajput, Bhumihar and Baniya recluses of the upper castes because they do not have the support of the BJP
 duusari ore, bhagava party bhi nitish kii jedy (you) kii jholii main jane vaale pichhadi jatiyon, mahadalit or muslim voton kaa ek hissaa bhi kho sakati he
 However, Muslims still applaud Nitish Kumar for keeping tight control over the BJP during the alliance in Bihar and for breaking the relationship in the name of Modi
 lekin unhen bihar ke mukhyamantri in chunaavon main rajnatik rup se modi se loha lene main sakasham nahin dikhte
 Recalling the Lalu-led coalition's victory in 29 seats in Bihar in 2004, Anwar Ahmed says, "it was the My (muslim-yadav) factor in Bihar that blew the nda's 'bharat Uday'
" ” argedy ke netaa ko 10 siton par jeet kaa puraa bharosa he
 These include from Jhanjharpur, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Araria, Saran and Vaishali to East and West Champaran
 in nirvachan kshetron main muslim or yadav voter, kul votaron ke 30 se 40 fisadi hai
 bjp's Bihar election incharge Dharmendra Pradhan told India Today on April 28, “we are winning a lot of seats
 lalu duusare number par hai or vah bhi kaaphi kam siton ke saath
 "nitish is most helpless in these elections
 sambhawatah chunaav nattejey ko bhaanpate hue unhone apane fasebuk wal par likhaah na ram kaa hua, na rahamaan kaa hua; kuch kabir si fitrat thi, har insaan kaa hua
 He has been in a very good position since becoming the Chief Minister of Bihar in November 2005
 unke netritv main 2009 ke chunaav main endie ne 40 main se 32 siten jiti thim or vidhansabha chunaav main bhi jabardast jeet hasil kii thi
 They have been sidelined in these Lok Sabha elections due to breaking alliances with BJP and forming congress-rjd alliances
 ek samay unki takat rahe ati pichhadaa varg, mahadalit, muslim or savarna jatiyon kaa vot bank ab unke pratidwandviyon main bant chukaa he
 Nitish, while addressing the rallies, confronts all of them with utter impunity, "if i am not a factor then why is Lalu talking about me?" The result will surprise everyone
 ”udhar, lalu ne apana aadhaar waapas paane kii har koshish kii
 He also endured Rahul Gandhi's indifference to the alliance with the Congress
 agar nitish congress se gathjod karne main kaamyaab ho jate to kahani puri badal jane kii baat kehete hue argedy ke netaa kehete hai, “lalu jaanate the ki muslim narendra modi ko rokane ke liye ranneetik dhang se vot denge or congress ke saath saajhedaari karnaa phayda kaa sauda sabit hoga
 Signs of Nitish's isolation had started to be found much earlier

 Due to the aggressive campaigning of the bjp's backward and backward, they hope that their performance can be improved from the 12 seats they won in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin lalu ne in chunaavon main apana sab kuch jhonk diya he
 It can be said that the third phase elections can play a decisive role in the state

 ?> Advocate Harishankar Jain has opposed the agreement on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha
 unhone kaha ki agar court main partiyaan maan jaati hai, to aam janata is samjhaute ko nahin maanegi
 On this, Justice SA Bobde has said that you are thinking that some kind of compromise has to be done, someone will lose, someone will win
 madhyasthata main har baar aisa nahin hota he
 > Justice Bobde said that it is not just a matter of land but of emotions, that is why we want a solution out of the conversation
 unhone kaha ki koi us jagah bane yaa bigade nirmaan ko yaa itihaas ko pehle jaisaa nahin kar saktaa he
 Therefore, talk can improve itself
 > justise bobade ne kaha ki babar ne jo kiya ham use thik nahin kar sakate hai, abhi jo halaat hai ham usapar baat hi karenge
 He said that if a case goes to arbitration, then the court has nothing to do with its decision
 > hindu mahasabha ne court main kaha ki is cese ko madhyasthata ke liye bheja jaae isse pehle notice jaruri he
 This is why the Hindu Mahasabha is opposing it
 unhone kaha ki kyonki ye hamaari jameen he isliye ham madhyasthata ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 > Justice Bhushan has said that if public notice is given in this case, the case will run for years, this arbitration will be under the supervision of the court
 > babari masjid paksh kii ore se rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki kanoonee nazariye se arbitreshan or mediation main fark he, isliye arbitreshan main court kii sahmati jaruri he balki madhyasthata main aisa nahin he

 What was the opinion of the parties on arbitration? However, on the advice of arbitration, many voices of the parties were heard in the Supreme Court
 hindu mahasabha ke vakeelon ne supreme court main madhyasthata kaa virodh kiya tha or kaha tha ki is prakaar kii koshishen pehle bhi ho chuki hai jo har baar naakaam rahi he

 north korea or america ke bich ab zabaani jang bhi aakhri mukaam par he
 Marshal Kim Jong Un is already bent on war, but now even US President Donald Trump has threatened an attack on North Korea like never before
 lekin kim jong un ko daraane kii har america koshish ke bich main china kii diwaar khadi he
 The red-handed china-american intelligence satellite has revealed that India's neighboring country, China North Korea, provides assistance
 united nesan ke pratibandh ke baad bhi china marshall kim jong un ke saath najar aa rahaa he
 The US intelligence satellite has caught China red-handed while helping dictator Kim
 ab america daawey ke saath kah rahaa he ki north korea or china ke bich bhaichara kaayam he
 China's eye on the tension is North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un, on the other hand, President Donald Trump of the superpower country on the other side
 donon ek duusare ko aamane saamne se dekhe bina hi is kadar nafrat karne lage hai ki lagata he ek duusare par hamalaa kiye bina chaiyn kii saans nahin lenge
 But the echo of this tension of both of them is now being heard in China as well
 trump ko bhi pataa he or duniya bhi ye jaanati he ki jab tak china he
 Till then, America cannot attack North Korea
 samasya kaa hal bhi china ke pasisaki vajah se north korea se uski aarthik saajhedaari yaa dosti nahin balki iske kai kaaran hai
 It is also true that if someone can get North Korea settled without any war, then it is China
 yahi vajah he ki america is maamle main china ke role par jor de rahaa he
 Trump himself also lured China into expanding trade
 magar china abhi dur se hi tamaasha dekhne kii niti apana rahaa he
 However, China itself wants to solve this problem peacefully
 kyonki wo jaanata he ki jang ke halaat main use kai tarah kii dikkaton se do-chaar hona padegaa or sabase badi samasya north korian sharnaarthi honge
 Who will not go to Japan and South Korea only to turn to China if war breaks out
 jang main north korea kaa saath degaa chirmerica agar north korea par hamalaa karata he, to use lene ke dene pad sakate hai kyonki jang ke haalat main china ko har haal main north korea kaa saath dena hi hoga
 This is because both the US and North Korea have treaties with China
 1950 se lekar 1953 tak north or south korea ke bich chali jang main china or rus ne uttar korea kaa saath diya tha
 After which the war ended with a ceasefire treaty mediated by the UN
 is sandhi ke dauraan washington or beijing ke bich ek samjhauta ye bhi hua tha ki agar america bhavishya main north korea par hamalaa karata he to seez fire tut jayega
 The Treaty between China and North Korea Apart from this, in 1961, the leftist governments of China and North Korea entered into another important treaty
 iskaa naam ‘china-uttar korian parsparik sahaayta or sahyog mitrataa sandhi’ tha
 The treaty states that if any other country attacks any country in China and North Korea, the two countries will have to cooperate with each other immediately
 pichley saalon main in donon deshon ne is sandhi kii vaidhata kii avadhi badhaakar 2021 tak kar di he
 Some foreign affairs experts say that both countries have benefited from this treaty
 jahaan china ne isse apane vyapaarik hit saadhe vahiin
 
 north korea ye sandhi karke apane aap ko or surakshit karne main kaamyaab ho gaya
 North Korea is also very important for China from the economic point of view in North Korea market
 pichley chaar dashakon se uttar korian bazaar main china kaa ecchhatra raaj kaayam he
 Apart from this, the presence of US forces in this area has also disturbed China and that is why it wants to solve this problem soon
 china lagaataar yahi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi tarah jang ke halaat ko khatm kiya ja sake
 That is why the Chinese Foreign Minister had warned both the US and North Korea that if there is a war, no one will win in it, while both may have to suffer the wounds that never go away
 magar ab china main is baat kii sugabugahat tej he ki jang ke halaat main china kaa role kya hoga
 According to the state-run newspaper Global Times, China should not remain silent if America attacks North Korea with the intention of changing power
 akshay kumaar bollywood ke ekmaatr superstar hai jo saal bhar main teen se chaar filmein kar lete hai or unke produsar ghate main nahin rahete hai

 Akshay Kumar's budget is less than the budget of Khan Trio's films, and most of the films have their own producers as well

 byopic se bad rahaa he kadaunhone 'rustam' or 'airlift' jaisi filmein kya kin darshakon ke bich unki hansod akshay vaali image ekadam khatm ho gai
 Before that he was known only for comedy films
 lekin 'rustam' or 'airlift' main kii gai syrius acting ne unhen nai pahchaan dilaai he
 His upcoming film 'padman' is also a real life inspired story
 yani akshay manoranjan ke saath sandesh kaa sahi mixchar lekar aage bad rahe hai
