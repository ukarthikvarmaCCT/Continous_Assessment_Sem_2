 After almost 50 years, the demand for separate Dravidanadu from the South Indian states has started again
 bharat ke bheetar hi kuch netaa ek alag dravidanadu yani dakshin ke paanch rajyon ko milakar banane kii baat kah rahe hai, vahiin kuch netaa bharat se alag hone kii maang bhi kar rahe hai
 South Indian leaders say that the states of the south get less importance and privileges from the Government of India than the North Indian states
 jiske kaaran dakshin bhartiya rajyon ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The demand for Dravidanadu has been raised from time to time, but this time it has been raised by actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan, who recently formed one of his political parties, Makkal Needhi Mayyam
 ve tamilnadu ke saath-saath dakshin ke anya rajyon main bhi apni party ke vistaar kii mahatvakanksha rakhte hai
 His demand has been supported by DMK leader MK Stalin, who is also in search of lost political land in the southern state of Tamil Nadu
 in donon netaaon kaa kahana he ki yadi dakshin ke sabhi rajya ek saath dravidanadu kii maang karen to unki aawaaj or buland ho jaaegi
 Telugu film actor and Janasena Party leader Pawan Kalyan has even suggested the name of United States of Southern India, justifying such demand
 tidipi ke saansad murali mohan ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki agar dakshin ke rajyon se isi prakaar bhedbhaav hota rahaa to dakshin ke paanchon rajya tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telangna, karnataka or kerala milakar khud ko swatantra ghoshit kar denge
 Actually, Dravidanadu has been in demand since 1940
 1940 main periyar kii justise party ne apni is maang ko lekar ek prastaav bhi paas kiya tha
 This proposal called for a separate country for the Dravidian people
 1940 se 1960 ke dashak main is maang ne or jor pakadaa, jab periyar ke purv sahyogi sien annadurai ne may 1962 main sansad main kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki tamilnadu (tatkaaleen madras) ko ek alag desh kaa darja de diya jaae or dakshin ke rajyon ko milakar dravidanadu naam se ek alag desh kaa gathan kaa kiya jaae
 He argued that the environment of the south is different from the rest of India
 annadurai kii is baat kaa sansad main jansangh ke netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kadaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki aazaadee ke 15 varshon ke baad is tarah kii maang anuchit he
 Vajpayee's talk was also supported by the majority of Members of Parliament
 60 ke dashak main hindi bhashaa ko lekar vivaad ne bhi is maang ko or zyada hawa de di, mashhoor lekhak ramchandra guha ke mutabik tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pan

 In fact till now, there has been allocation of finance to the states based on the population of 1971, but this time according to the population of 2011, there has been a provision to allocate finance to the states

 K, Tamil Nadu received Rs 22,000 crore

 Over and about Rs

 According to the 2011 census, the states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, MP and Jammu and Kashmir will benefit from the allocation of finance

 Dtrack's support for cyber attack on nuclear power plant
 north korea bhi ise sibar atake ke liye yuj karata he
 You must have heard the news of cyber attack at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL)
 lekin ye sibar atake newclear facility main nahin hua or na hi kisi aise computer main hua he jo critical control se judaa ho
 That is, for now there can be no major loss
 lekin ye sibar atake gambhir jarur he or ise north korea ke saath joda ja rahaa he
 This cyber attack can also be seen as a first step for hackers
 aam taur par hekking main aisa hota he ki pehle step main havers aise computer yaa divaais ko torget karte hai jisaki ahmiyat zyada nahin hoti he
 Because their aim is to collect a lot of basic information in the beginning
 shuruyaat main to newclear korporation of india ne is khabar ko galat bataaya or kaha ki sibar atake nahin hua he or aisa mumkin bhi nahin he
 NPCIL has previously confessed to a cyber attack but later the Nuclear Power Corporation of India has admitted that a cyber attack has taken place
 statement main kaha gaya
 The news of malware being found in npcil's system is true
 CERT ne 4 sitambar 2019 ko ise notice kiya he or jaankaree di gai he'department of atomic energy ne tatkaal jaanch shuru kii or paaya ki ye prabhavit computer ek yujar kaa he jo internet se connected tha or ye administrative kaamon ke liye tha
 This computer was not connected to the critical network system
 gauratlab he ki newclear facility main yuj kiye jane vaale ahm computers jo critical network kaa hissaa hote hai wo kisi bhi bahari network yaa internet se connected nahin hote hai, taaki hekking yaa sibar atake ke khataron se bachaa ja sake
 Pukhraj Singh tweeted about the cyber attack at Kudankulam nuclear plant
 pukhraj sibar security export hai jinhone bharat kii technilak intelligence agency NTRO (national Technical Research Organization) ke liye kaam kiya he
 On Twitter, he has shared information about this hacking
 sibar security research pukhraj ke mutabik ek mailaware atake newclear power plant main kiya gaya he jo newclear facility kii domen level controlar kaa acces kar saktaa he
 He only told about this malware that it is Dtrack
 report ke mutabik Dtrack naam kaa milavayer ko north korea kii taraf se yuj kiya jaataa he
 It has been developed by the Lazaru Group and works for the North Korea State Spy Agency
 Dtrack mailaware kya karata he?sibar security form Kaspersky ke mutabik Drack ek remote acces trogen he jise RAT bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is used to install dangerous modules in target computers
 inamen keelogar or broujar history chori karne vaale tuls bhi shaamil hai
 Apart from this, through this malware, hackers can get data from a computer including IP address and other active network connection connected to that computer
 jaise hamane pehle bataaya ki havers shuruyaat main kaaphi basic jaankariyaan colect karte hai or ye mailaware basic jaankariyaan colect karne kaa hi tul he
 Through this malware, hackers sitting thousands of kilometers away can run some kind of dangerous software in the target computer, upload data and tamper with it
 kuch saal pehle dtrack se bhartiya banking system ko torget kiya gaya tha
 The government has not said anything about it so far - like who was responsible for this cyber attack, what kind of attack was there
 itnaa jarur kaha gaya he ki ye gambhir nahin tha or isaki jaanch kii gai or ab sab thik he
 Dtrack can also be seen as the first step for a targeted cyber attack
 ye sawaal bhi jaruri he ki agar pukhraj singh jis taraf ishaara kar rahe hai agar north korea link he to ye nishchit taur par ye sibar atake gambhir ho saktaa he
 Because cyber attacks are like big changes for the world, cyber attacks are growing rapidly in India

 The BJP is going through the best phase in its history
 desh ke aadhe se zyada rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 But as the most popular Chief Minister, no BJP CM could make his mark
 desh ke sabase tej news channel 'ajtak' ne siyaasi mizaaj ko samajhane ke liye sabase bada survey kiya he
 Under this, public opinion was known for the most popular CM of the country
 iske tahat siem ke taur par desh kii sabase pehali pasand pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee hai
 Whereas there are many states in the country where the BJP has a chief minister for 15 years
 iske baavjood wo desh ke logon kii pehali pasand nahin ban sake hai
 Explain that Aaj Tak presented the country's largest survey on Thursday
 iske jariye desh ke alag-alag hisson se jaakar janaa ki maujuuda samay main desh kaa sabase behatar mukhyamantri koun he? desh ke 19 rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Despite this, the BJP chief minister is lagging behind in popularity

 According to Aaj Tak's survey, Mamata Banerjee is the best CM with 12 per cent
 2011 main unhone bengal kii satta par teen dashak se kabiz sipiem ko ukhaad phenkaa tha or pehali baar siem bani thi
 After this, CM became the second time in 2016

 Nitish Kumar is second in popularity as Mamata Banerjee as the popular CM, followed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 survey ke mutabik unhen 11 fisadi log sabase behatar siem maanate hai
 He has become the Chief Minister for the fourth time

 RJD, which has been in power in Bihar for 15 years, was overthrown in 2005 along with BJP and became Chief Minister
 iske baad se lagaataar wo teesri baar siem bane hai
 Nitish formed the government in 2015 with a separate RJD from the BJP, but in 2017, he has joined the BJP again by breaking the Grand Alliance
 wo jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi hai
 Kejriwal is at number three as Yogilokri CM at third and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at number three
 ajtak ke survey ke mutabik desh ke 9 fisadi log unhen behatar siem maan rahe hai
 After this, Yogi Adityanath became the CM of UP 10 months ago on the fourth position
 desh ke 9 fisadi log unhen bhi best siem maan rahe hai
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh is at number five
 singh ke mahaj 6 fisadi log pansad kar rahe hai
 Shivraj is nowhere in the list of popular CM survey, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is not seen anywhere
 jabaki shivaraj pichley 15 saal se mukhyamantri hai
 Despite this, they have not become popular
 itnaa hi nahin gujarat main bijepi ne lagaataar chhathi baar sarkaar banaai he or vijay roopaani duusari baar siem bane hai
 But that too is nowhere in this list
 isi tarah goa se lekar rajasthan tak siem logon kii pasand nahin ban paa rahe hai

 Muslims also got 2 out of the Muslim candidates fielded by Shiv Sena, 2 Muslim candidates were able to win, these candidates won from ward number 64, 96
 iske saath hi purvi upnagar, pashchimi upnagar or mumbai shahar main rahane vaale gaiyr-marathi vot bhi shivasena ko hi mili
 The BJP, hoping to become a party of surprise, would be very surprised by the BJP, as the Shiv Sena's image was opposed to non-marathi people, so it hoped that this vote would go to its own account but it could not happen
 hindibhashi ke saath vyapaariyon kaa bhi saathdakshin mumbai ke wordon main badi taadaad main gaiyr-marathi rahete hai, yahaan ke ward 203 main shivasena ke sachin padaval chunaav jeetne main safal rahe

 Describing the allegations of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad colluding with the BJP and trying to eliminate regional parties as baseless and ridiculous, Bihar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Ajit Pratap Singh said his party opposes regionalism but is not opposed to regional parties 
 singh ne lalu ke ukt bayaan ko niraadhaar or haasyaaspad bataate hue aaj kaha ki congress kshetravaad kaa virodh karti he lekin kshetreey dalon kii virdohi nahin he
 He said that if the RJD and JDU have started fearing to save their existence, then this is the result of their own 'karma', the Congress has nothing to do with it
 rajd supremon lalu prasad ko loksabhaa main agali pankti main sthaan die jane par bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke rajd or congress ke bich santh-ganth hone ke aarope par singh ne kaha ki congress kii bihar main babbti lokapriyata or uske janaadhar ke vistaar ko dekhakar anya dalon ke rajaneta apana maansik santulan kho chuke hai
 This is the reason that his party is sometimes being accused of baseless connivance with the BJP or sometimes with the RJD and on the other hand, there is an attempt to intimidate the upper castes and minorities

 It is pleasant for the reader to read a book which is not too thick and which he believes to be easy to read in one sitting

 What not to give the reader from the memories of the writer ? And when the memoir writer has written on the memories of his great writer Guru, then the reader associated with writing should also read it, but he who is not connected with that process? Prabhat has not only made the pudding of the memoir tasty, has fed it with a straight finger

 To the same writer who makes Hindi the medium of Hindi speakers to understand and write deeply

 On the other hand, those who are fond of writing are also in search of a medium from where they can get tips related to writing

 The author has truly recounted his experiences with Joshi, has drawn a conclusion by linking the two incidents to the detective, giving tips on how to develop the story, telling of changing gurus (it is more that Sudhish Pachauri is not Definitions) and postmodern definitions are searched
 namvar singh, ashok vaajapeyi se lekar camel hasan tak kaiyon kii pole bhi unhone kholi he
 Had Prabhat told that thing too, the burden would have been removed, due to which Joshi was not talking to him in the last days

 In the context of this episode, he recounts an incident in Muzaffarpur
 vahaan jane par ve roj janaki vallabh shastri se milane jate
 He noticed that after him another man would reach there and sit at a distance and kept listening to them

 The arrest of JDU MLA Anant Singh in Bihar, known as 'chhote Sarkar', has created a new stir in the state's politics among the people
 marcides se lekar buggy tak kii sawari karne vaale anant singh ko hatya or apharan ke maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 a look at the political and criminal career of Bahubali Anant Singh, considered close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 
 
 buudhvaar ko bihar police ne jis maamle messnant singh ko giraftaar kiyaahai vah chaar yuvakon ke apharan or unamem se ek kii hatya kaa he
 In fact, the whole incident started when four youths molested a woman in Patna's Flood Market area on June 17
 isko lekar kaaphi hangaamaa hua
 It is alleged that at the behest of Anant Singh, his operatives kidnapped the four youths
 jinamein se ek yuvak kii dardanaak tareeke se hatya kar di gai thi
 The next day his body was found lying in a forest
 maamle main police ne kai aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha or baaki teenon apahrit yuvakon ko bhi baraamad kar liya tha
 During interrogation, the accused revealed that the MLA had ordered the four youths to teach a lesson, but the police reached there before they could kill the remaining youths
 nitish ne chunaav jeetne ke liye liya anant kaa sahaara2005 pehali baar chunaav jeetne vaale mokama ke is ‘don’ kii sarkaar alag hi chalati he
 Several criminal cases also came against him but due to pressure from the government, the police could not take any action against him
 2005 main lalu prasad yadav ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke dauraan nitish ne bihar ko aparaadhiyon se mukt karne kaa vaada to kiya lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye anant kaa hi sahaara liya
 After coming to power, more than 80,000 criminals in Bihar were declared guilty by the courts
 hajaaron apradhi jail bheje gaye jinamein lalu prasad kaa kareebi mohammad shahabuddin bhi shaamil tha lekin anant singh ko chune kii himmat kisi main nahin hui
 After winning the election, Anant Singh started trying to establish himself as Bahubali
 balaatkaar or hatya ke maamle main bhi saamne aayaa namvarsh 2007 main ek mahila se balaatkaar or hatya ke maamle main anant singh ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne ai
 When a journalist of the news channel questioned him in this regard, he was beaten fiercely by a drunk man of muscle power
 maamle ne tool pakadaa or vidhayak kii giraftaar bhi hui lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne chuppi saadh lee
 Anant Singh, the MLA of his own party, bowed forward
 
 In 2013, Anant Singh has also been accused of encroaching in front of his hotel in the posh Pataliputra Colony of Patna
 haalanki jab bavaal badha to bahubali ne jameen khaali kar di
 Interestingly, Anant Singh, who created terror and forced people to bow down with his dabang image, was forced to retreat due to Parveen Amanullah, one of his party's mlas and Social Welfare Minister
 artiai activist se mantri baniin parveen amanulla bina kisi suraksha ke anant singh ke hotel ke saamne ja pahunchin thim or hotel ke adhikariyon ko turant atikaraman hataane ke nirdesh die the
 Property increased with becoming a legislator, five years after becoming a legislator, Anant Singh's wealth has increased manifold
 2005 main anant singh ne apane chunavi halafname main 3
 40 lakh was declared to be a nominal asset, which increased to 38 in 2010
 84 lakh rupee tak pahunch gai
 Till now no such information has been disclosed in public that they have ever been questioned about becoming rich in this rare way and immediately
 lalu kaa ghoda lekar meley main pahunche!2007 main jaanwaron ke meley main vah lalu yadav kaa ghoda lekar pahunche the
 Anant Singh knew that Lalu would not sell him his horse, so he bought the horse through someone else
 ajgar paalane jaisi apni sanak ke liye charchit ye vidhayak mahoday pehle bhi kai vivaadon main funs chuke hai
 For example, using another's Mercedes arbitrarily under pressure or aerial firing during an event is also on record
 petrol bachaane ke liye marcides chhod buggy chalaianant ne petrol bachaane ke liye apane marcides chhodkar ghoda-buggi chalaai
 Anant Singh, who is always surrounded by controversies, used horse-buggy to go to the Vidhan Sabha
 anant singh kaa kahana tha ki maine apane liye ye buggi dilli main banavaai thi, ise kuch saal pehle maine ghar mangavaya
 From then on, i continue to drive horse-buggy because there is no need of petrol in it
 purv CM maanjhi ne bhi lagaae hai gambhir aropbihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne bhi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par gambhir aarope lagaate hue kaha ki vah apane bahubali vidhayak anant singh se meri hatya karwaane kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 After being forced to step down from the chief minister's post, Manjhi said, "the Bihar government is paying a lot of attention to the criminals
 nitish kumaar or bahubali anant singh main khub banati he
 The mlas who were in my support used to get threats from Anant Singh
 nitish ke ishaare par anant singh meri hatya kar saktaa he
 ' salmaan khan pichley kaaphi samay se charchaa main hai

 Apart from this film, Salman is also preparing for Kick 2 with Jacqueline Fernandez
 kai aisi reports bhi thim ki dabang 3 ke alaava salmaan no entry ke sikval kii bhi taiyaari kar rahe hai lekin lagata he ki dabang khan ne is film kii shooting karne se manaa kar diya he
 According to reports, Salman and Anil Kapoor do not have same dates and since Salman does not want to shoot without Anil, he has started working on his next Eid release Kick 2
 jaise hi salmaan or anil kapur ke paas saim dats hongi, no entry ke sikval kii shooting shuru ho sakegi
 Significantly, Salman has left the project Inshallah of Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 salmaan is film main aalia bhatta ke saath kaam karne vaale the
 When asked about working at Inshallah during the IIFA Awards, he said that Inshallah is not being made, Inshallah is now becoming something else

 After Nagesh, another independent legislator withdrew support by Monday evening
 3
 After the resignation of the mlas, the party continuously tried to convince them
 lekin vah nahin maane, itnaa hi nahin sarkaar ke sabhi mantriyon ne bhi apane pad se istipha diya
 First the ministers of Congress quota resigned and later the ministers of JDS quota also quit
 4
 Efforts are being made by the Congress to change the cabinet in the government, efforts are on to bring back the angry legislators by making them ministers
 5
 Congress leader DK Shivakumar has been sent to Mumbai to convince the angry mlas
 lekin vah mumbai ravaanaa hue uske saath hi sabhi vidhayakon ko vahaan se goa shift kar diya gaya
 However, the news came on Tuesday morning that he was in Mumbai

 On Monday, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh also replied in the Lok Sabha on this issue and said that the BJP has nothing to do with what is happening in Karnataka
 rahul gandhi ke istife dene ke baad se kii congress main ye culture shuru hua he
 7
 congress netaa adheer ranjan choudhary ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi horse trading kar rahi he or vidhayakon ko apane paale main karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP has 303 mps, yet it is not full

 8
 purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa kaa somvaar ko bayaan aayaa tha ki unhen ummid he ki abhi or vidhayak bhi istipha denge, jiske baad vah apni taraf se koi faisla lenge
 With this, he is still waiting for the Speaker's decision

 dilli uniwarsity ko dilli hai court se jhatka laga he
 The Delhi High Court has changed Delhi University's decision to change the admission process for undergraduate courses
 court ne kaha he ki snaatak paathyakramon ke liye daakhila prakriya vaise hi rakhi jaae jaisi satr 2018-19 main thi
 That is, after this decision from Delhi University Court, according to the changes made in the admission process, they will not be able to make new admissions
 adimishan ke liye ab 22 june hogi last detiske alaava court ne aaj yani 14 june ko khatm ho rahi online date ko bhi 22 june tak ke liye badha diya he
 The court while giving the verdict said that Delhi University can make changes a day before
 chaatro ko teen maheene pehle notice dena chahie tha
 This decision from the court will provide relief to nearly three and a half lakh students who have filled the form to enroll in DU this time
 dilli uniwarsity ke faisle par hai court ne ye kahajustise anu malhotra or justise talavant singh kii peeth ne dilli uniwarsity se kaha he ki isamen koi vivaad nahin he ki aapako samay ke saath talmail bithaana jaruri he
 Nothing prevents you from improving education standards
 sanshodhan ke liye kiya gaya aapkaa faisla mumkin he ki sahi ho lekin iskaa samay shaayad thik nahin he
 a public interest litigation was filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the Delhi University's decision to amend the eligibility criteria for several undergraduate courses including b
com (hons) and BA (hons), Economics, on which the High Court has given this decision
 dilli uniwarsity ne pichley maheene admician kii prakriya shuru hone se 1 din pehle 29 may ko yah sanshodhan lagu kar die the
 After which many students who came to enroll in Delhi University were being denied admission here
 lekin court se aae aaj ke aadesh ke baad un sabhi lakhon chaatro ne raahat kii saans lee he
 After the High Court order, now with the new amendments, the admission process in Delhi University will start in the next session itself
 bataa den ki dilli uniwarsity ke aadhin 79 college aate hai
 Out of the nearly three to three and a half lakh students who have filled the form for admission, about one and a half lakh get admission in different colleges of Delhi University, ie this decision coming from the High Court will have a big impact

 viru ne ek majaak kiya tha or us par hansane kii baat main sweekaar karata hum
 He is a very tickling person and this is one of his millions that i laughed at
 bas itani si baat he
 But now i am surprised that i am being held responsible for inciting hatred against a young woman
 vah ladki bhi aisa hi maanati he
 This is completely wrong
 hamaari yah bilkul bhaavana nahin thi or hamaare twit uske prati ghrinaa kaa prasar karne ke maamle main katai koi strot nahin hai
 The girl gave her opinion on one issue
 vah jis cheez main yakeen rakhti he, uske liye khadi hui
 So he must have the courage and patience to listen to things against him
 is maamle main kisi duusare par anguli uthaanaa (is cese main mere upar) or unako jimmedaar tehraana uchit nahin he
 
 
 i am not against him at all and firmly believe that violence is wrong
 kisi mahila ko hinsa kii dhamkee dena or bhi gambhir aparaadh he or is tarah kaa kaam karne waalon ko kathor dand diya janaa chahie

 diemke (shaamil hone par sanshay) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday told Advocate General Gopal Subramanian that he would discuss his resignation with his cabinet colleagues
 pradhanmantri ne tab tak unhen intjaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Subrahmanyam submitted his resignation on Saturday
 yah jaankaree aadhikarik sutron ne di
 Subrahmanyam had on Saturday offered to resign as the country's second most important law officer
 subrahmanyam jaahir taur par kendriya sanchaar mantri kapil sibbal se khafa hai, kyonki unhone 2ji maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay main sarkaar kii pairvi ke liye unke badale varisht adhivaktaa rohington nariman kii niyukti kii he
 Subrahmanyam asked the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Saturday to whom he submitted his resignation as Union Law Minister Veerappa Moily has refused to take his resignation
 sutron ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri ne subrahmanyam se tab tak intjaar karne ke liye kaha jab tak ki vah apane mantrimandal ke sahyogiyon se is masale par charchaa nahin kar lete
 Subrahmanyam told reporters on Sunday that he had resigned from his post to maintain 'dignity of office'
 sibbal dwaara sarvocch nyaayalay main ek duusare vakil kii niyukti kiye jane par subrahmanyam ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he yah nishpaksh nahin he
 "sources also reported that Subrahmanyam spoke to Moily present in Bengaluru on Saturday
 moili ne haalanki unhen apane istife par dobaaraa vichaar karne ke liye kaha
 It may be noted that Subrahmanyam met President Pratibha Patil on Sunday morning but the meeting was called a courtesy call

 Madhu Pandey alleges that due to her husband's job, she was forced to bear the words of the chairman, but she was expelled from the party when she protested
 madhu kaa aarope he ki oktober 2012 main jab chairman lakhanu meeting main gaye the, to unhone phone par usase 'chuje le aane' kii aapattijanak maang kii thi

 jawaab main madhu 'haa' kahati hai to dadda kehete hai, 'maal khara he
 
 ?'itnaa hi nahin, jab madhu dadda se 'chuja' kaa matlab puuchhati hai to dadda pehle madhu se kehete hai, 'tum sab jaanati ho' or phir bolte hai ki chuja maane 19 se 20, 18 se 20 saal tak kii

 The chairman also said that he would put his side before the party high command
