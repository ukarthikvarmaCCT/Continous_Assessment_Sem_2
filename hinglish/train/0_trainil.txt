 In a press conference with Thomas, Maken said that a budget of Rs 5,55,000 crore was earmarked for the scheme, but its implementation would only put an additional burden of Rs 23,800 crore on the government exchequer, which would be the budget set for the entire scheme
 Is much lower than this and will not have any burden on revenue
 vipaksh par bajet satr main vidheyak paarit nahin karne kaa aarope lagaate hue maakan ne kaha ki adhyadesh laane kaa nirnay vipaksh dwaara koi anya vikalp nahin chode jane ke baad liya gaya
 Describing it as 'sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi's dream', Maken said that this would enable about 80 crore population of the country to get food grains at concessional rates

 He said that Ajay Maken had said in the first press conference that there was a huge scam in the CCTV project, but today when he spoke to reporters again, the issue shifted from corruption to the Chinese company
 CCTV ke jawaab main AAP ne maakan kii degree par uthaae sawaljis camera company par ajay maakan sawaal uthaa rahe hai, gyaat ho ki wo duniya kii sabase badi camera company he

 The situation has become critical due to the mixing of fog with pollution in all areas of North West India including the capital Delhi
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki is sthiti main philhal kisi khaas sudhaar kii gunjaaish najar nahin aa rahi he
 It is estimated that the air in all the areas of north-west India will remain more or less constant and due to this the air pollution in the atmosphere will remain here, apart from this, the winds in north-west India including delhi-ncr are sitting from the top down
 In this, it is called anti cyclonic condition, in this situation the mixing height of air pollution has come down considerably and due to the fireworks of Deepawali
 The pollution caused by the burning of already existing farms is showing a more fatal effect in these conditions
 In these conditions, scientists predict that the smog component in Delhi NCR will remain for the next 4 days
 pichley 4 dinon se gas chember bani hui he dillidilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main halke kohre ke saath ghanaa dhuna mix ho chukaa he or isaki vajah se yahaan par vaataavaran main har taraf smog chaaya hua he

 Due to the presence of harmful particles, ozone gas is also being produced on the surface in the Delhi environment, among them, due to the motor vehicles running in the capital, the amount of carbon monoxide is being recorded above normal in many areas
 Overall it can be said The capital of Delhi has been a gas chamber for the last 4 days

 How fine particles are less than 5 microns can be estimated from the fact that they cannot be seen with the eyes

 This pollution is affecting children, old and young people in one way: In the air pollution of the capital Delhi, the patients of asthma, heart patients, people suffering from serious diseases and patients getting their treatment in ICU are the quickest losers

 At present, Rajendra Pal Gautam is handling the water ministry in Delhi but it is clear from Kejriwal's handling of this ministry that Kejriwal is not satisfied with the work of Rajendra Pal Gautam
 rajendra paal gautam se pehle kapil mishra jal mantri the jinako may 2017 main mantri mandal se hataa diya gaya tha ye daleel dekar ki wo thik se kaam nahi kar rahe the, bahut shikaayatein aa rahi thim
 However, this argument did not get embraced by anyone
 kapil mishra se pehle manish sisodiya ne ye mantralay sambhala or purv main dilli main siem rahete khud shila dikshit ye mantralay sambhalati thim
 In 2012, Kejriwal started politics only by raising issues like electricity and water
 2013 main satta main aate hi har maheene 20,000 litre pani har maheene muft karne kaa elaan kiya tha or dilli ke har ghar main pine kaa saaf pani pahunchane kaa aam aadmi party kaa chunavi vaada bhi tha jisko puraa karne ke liye bhi lagata he kejariwal ko khud ke mantralay sanbhaalanaa hoga
 It is believed that soon Kejriwal will take this ministry from Rajendra Pal Gautam
 2012 main kejariwal ne raajnneeti kii shuruyaat hi bijli pani jaise muddon ko uchhaalkar kii thi
 As soon as he came to power in 2013, he announced to make 20,000 liters of water free every month and the Aam Aadmi Party's election promise to provide clean drinking water to every house in Delhi was also fulfilled, which Kejriwal himself seems to fulfill Will have to handle the ministry
 mana ja rahaa he ki jald hi kejariwal rajendra paal gautam se ye mantralay apane paas le lenge
 Ok so it had to come to this

 When the light dimmed in the auditorium of the Washington Convention Center and the film started playing on the huge screen just above the head, the eyes of 50 heads of state, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, went together
 ye sabhi netaa chauthe parmaanu suraksha sammelan main 1 april ko hissaa lene ke liye washington disi main jamaa hue the
 Just before this, US President Barack Obama sent media out of the auditorium and informed the leaders present there that the film was made by terrorists to assess a possible nuclear attack and the conditions that would follow
 is film ko dekhnaa yuddh par aadhaarit kisi video game main hissaa lene jaisaa tha jahaan netaaon ko asann parmaanu hamale par apni pratikriyaayein deni thim
 One scene in the film leaves everyone open when terrorists are blowing crop dusters and spraying lethal radioactive material from medical institutions on a densely populated area that spreads terrible disease and kills people

 How serious the threat of terrorists is of a nuclear attack is revealed by information gathered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IEAA), which has been included in an Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) of nuclear and radioactive elements
 taaja aankade 31 disambar, 2014 tak ke uplabdh hai, jinke mutabik, itedibi ne duniya bhar main 1993 se lekar is taarikh tak samvedansheel parmaanu saamagree or radiodharmee sroton ke anadhikarik swaamitv or chori samet sambandhit aapraadhik gatividhiyon ke kul 2,734 pusht maamle saamne aae hai
 The IAEA assesses, "the incidents reported in the ITDB show that nuclear and other radioactive materials are being smuggled and that problems such as theft, disappearance and other unofficial antics are increasing
" ”bharat ke lihaaj se parmaanu aatankwaad kaa khatra vaastavik he or ab yah maatr kapol kalpana bhar nahin rah gaya he
 For example, India has vast nuclear facilities that have a vast capacity — manufacturing nuclear weapons (india currently has 120 nuclear weapons), 22 power-generating reactors, some of which also produce nuclear material for weapons, radioactive waste
 Has a large stockpile (burned fuel) that is housed in specific storage areas and more than 7,000 institutions that use radioactive equipment , Which are especially diagnostics include the hospital (x-ray) and treatment (cancer)
 vaise to adhiktar parmaanu parisar sakht nigaraanee main hai or desh main parmaanu saamagree kii awajahi par nigaraanee rakhane vaali agenciyaan paryaapt sakasham hai, phir bhi yah chintaa lagaataar isliye badhati ja rahi he kyonki aatankwaadi ab in sansthaanon or suvidhaon main send lagane ke liye zyada sookshm tareeke apana rahe hai or ve aasaani se pakad main nahin aate
 Terrorists can carry out nuclear attacks in India and the rest of the world in three main ways: nuclear bomb explosions — either a weapon stolen from a state stockpile or a nuclear device designed to smuggle nuclear material designed for weapons
 kisi pramukh parmaanu pratishthan par hamalaa taaki baari maatra main jaanaleva vikiran vahaan se utsarjit ho sake or tabaahi laa sake
 Explosion of a diabolical bomb or radiological display device in an urban center
 bhartiya parmaanu pratishthan kitne surakshit?bharat main aatankwaadiyon ke liye parmaanu hathiyaar chura paanaa yaa parmaanu urja vibhaag (diei) ke parisaron se parmaanu hathiyaaron main lagane vaali radiodharmee saamagree kii taskari kar paanaa or usase bam bana paanaa behad mushkil he
 India's nuclear weapons are reportedly housed at different locations across the country and are housed within a concrete reinforcing shield protected by an enemy country's nuclear attack or bunker-breaking missile
 ye thikaane jabardast nigaraanee main hai or yahaan tak ki in tak behad kam logon kii pahunch he
 India has adopted the principle of not attacking first (which means that India will launch a nuclear attack on its own only after such an attack from another country), so this massive stockpile is kept in very safe and unknown places on which There is tremendous monitoring and guarding
 agar kabhi jang kaa khatra bahut bad gaya, tabhi inhen mixilon ke saath joda jayega
 The system of command and control in India is quite agile which goes directly to the Prime Minister (who has the code of instruction) and the National Security Council, which controls the movement of all nuclear weapons
 yah tantra behad ksaa hua he or gopneeyata kii aad main kaam karata he
 In this, other departments of the government also cannot make a dent, leave aside the talk of terrorists, who may have the intention of reaching them
 yah baat desh bhar ke un tamaam parmaanu parisaron par bhi samaan rup se lagu hoti he jahaan hathiyaaron ke liye parmaanu saamagree taiyaar kii jaati he or bam banaaya jaataa he
 There are two important agencies that work - Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) which builds nuclear centers and Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), which makes explosives and produces missiles for their transport
 in sansthaanon ke parisar “dephence in depth” pranali se mahfuj hai, jahaan baad, avrodh or suraksha ke kai str maujuud hai jiske chalate inamen send laga paanaa takreeban naammumkin he
 It is a different matter that important defense institutions of India are still weak in security and there is a need for more vigorous security as seen in the recent terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase
 kya bharat ke parmaanu urja sanyantr paryaapt mahfuj hai?bam churaana to takreeban naammumkin he, lekin ek khatra jise nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa, vah yah he ki aatankwaadi vastav main ek shaitani bam bana sakate hai or iske liye hathiyaar banane vaali parmaanu saamagree yaa hanikaarak radiodharmee padaarth bharat ke parmaanu parisaron se churaayaa ja saktaa he
 As with campuses around the world, any such threat is "internal" — that is, the huge number of employees inside these institutions who work in these institutions and who have access to facilities, materials, and all kinds of sensitive information

 The horrific terror attack in Brussels last month revealed that in August 2014, there was serious negligence in protecting Belgium's Doel-4 nuclear power reactor
 mana ja rahaa he ki ek karmchaaree ne ek critical kooling volve se chhedchhad kii thi jisase terbine jarurat se zyada garam ho gaya or nasht ho gaya
 Even though the accident happened in the non-nuclear sector of the plant, it caused a loss of nearly $ 200 million and had to be closed for several months

 Although it is not considered suspicious in the Doel-4 incident, it is a matter of concern that there was a potential jihadi who had access to sensitive areas of the plant

 However, this was limited to the outer periphery of the atomic complex
 phir bhi ise badi chook kaha ja saktaa he or iske gambhir nattejey nikal sakate hai
 Despite strict surveillance measures, there have been some incidents which are of concern
 karnataka ke kaiga parmaanu urja sanyantr main 2009 main ek asantusht karmchaaree ne kathith rup se peyajal aapurti ko plant ke heavi water se dooshit kar diya, jiske chalate 45 karmchaariyon main jehar fail gaya
 Similarly, in 2014 at the Madras Atomic Power Plant in Kalpakkam, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) head constable Vijay Singh shot three people with his service rifle soon after he came to work
 baad main pataa chalaa ki piarpy samiksha main uski maansik haalat kaa pataa lagane main chook hui thi
 The interior of all nuclear campuses is guarded by the CISF, and like other security forces, there are some disgruntled personnel and some who can easily be corrupted
 rajagopalan kii sifarish he ki nabhikeey sansthaanon ke liye alag se ek surakshabal banaaya jaae taaki bharat ke parmaanu sansthaanon kii suraksha shashakt ho sake or use bhednaa aasaan na ho
 Cyber attack is another major threat to nuclear plants
 america jab iran ke parmaanu kaarykram ko rokna chaah rahaa tha, to uske jasuson ne vahaan ke ek bhitari aadmi kaa istemaal karke centriphujon ko niyantrit karne vaale computaron main staxnet naam kaa virus dalava diya tha
 In addition to damaging the control system, a cyber attack can thwart alarms that prevent theft and even make changes to the accounting system to hide the theft
 aatankwaadi aisa karke samvedansheel suchanaaen chura sakate hai, jaisaa ki haal hi main dakshini korea ke ek nabhikeey sanyantr main dekhne main aayaa, jahaan karmchaariyon kii nijee soochna or parisar ke khaake ko hack kar liya gaya
 To take appropriate action keeping this threat in mind, India has set up the Computer Information and Security Advisory Group (CISAG) which now audits information systems, provides measures to prevent cyber attacks and eliminate their effects
 And prepares guidelines

 Regarding high-level radioactive waste, officials say the fuel cycle in India is such that approximately 97 percent of the burned fuel is reprocessed for use in fast breeder reactors
 isse plutonium kaa bhandaaran hone se bachaa liya jaataa he jo aatankwaadiyon kaa ahm nishaanaa ban saktaa he
 The remaining three per cent of the radioactive waste is cooled within 40 years by giving concrete form, and then disposed of in controlled areas

 There are over 7,000 institutes in India that have machines that use radioactive material for diagnosis and treatment, besides industrial use machines
 chintaa kii baat yah he ki is saamagree ke galat haathon main jane sambandhi kai khabaren bhi ai hai
 One such incident was in Mayapuri, Delhi in 2010 where cobalt was found near a junk which belonged to Delhi University

 Why broke the agreement with HAL? When the agreement with HAL was broken, he said that when the talk of 126 Rafale aircraft deal was going on, it was about the agreement with HAL
 lekin deal sahi tareeke se aage badhati to qaraar HAL ko hi miltaa
 But the agreement of 126 aircraft was not done correctly, so the contract for 36 aircraft was discussed
 jiske baad ye qaraar reliance ke saath aage badha
 He said that in the last days HAL himself said that he was not willing to join this offset
 or reliance ke saath qaraar kaa rasta puri tarah se saaf ho gaya

 video conferencing jariye is kaarykram main tamilnadu kii siem jayalalita bhi judin
 Know about this nuclear plant for which an agreement was signed with Russia 28 years ago
 1
 It is India's first nuclear power plant
 ise rus ke sahyog se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 2
 dakshini grid se jude is project kii pehali unit ne 31 disambar 2014 se kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 It has a capacity to generate 1000 MW units of electricity
 3
 Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is preparing to start the second unit of this project soon
 4
 NPCIL is setting up two 1000 MW Russian reactors at Kudankulamgam in Tirunelveli district
 5
 The initial estimated expenditure on the first and second units was around Rs 13,171 crore but due to project delays, rupee depreciation and some other reasons, the cost has increased to Rs 17,270 crore
 6
 These reactors are being built by a joint effort of NPCIL and the Russian company Atomstroyexport
 7
 The Government of India had signed with the Soviet Union in 1988 for the construction of this plant
 us vakt bharat ke pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or soviet union ke head mikhail gorbachev the
 But due to political and economic turmoil in Russia, its construction started in 1997
 8
 The first two units had to be halted again in September 2011 as villagers around the plant were opposing it
 haalanki march 2012 main isapar kaam phir se shuru ho gaya
 And they are currently producing electricity
 9
 On 13 July 2013, the first power generation was 300 MW, which was increased to 500 MW in a phased manner
 10
 Both units of the project will generate a total of 2,000 MW of power with 925 MW allocated to Tamil Nadu, 442 to Karnataka, 266 to Kerala, 67 MW to Puducherry
 baaki 300 megawatt kaa aavanton nahin kiya gaya he

 banaras se sate chandauli ko 1997 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mayawati ne banaras se alag karke jila banaaya tha
 It included Shivpur Legislative Assembly with Mughalsarai, Sakaldiha, Syedaraja and Ajagara of Varanasi
 jila banane ke 22 saal baad bhi chandauli kshetra badahaali kii haalat jhel rahaa he
 The situation is that it has not yet been fully built its headquarters
 haalanki purvanchal kii jo kuch hiprophile seat hai usame chandauli kaa bhi naam aata he
 In 2014, bjp's Mahendra Nath Pandey defeated bsp's Anil Maurya by about 1
5 lakh votes
 dhan kaa katoraa kahe jane vaale chandauli jile kaa adhikansh hissaa gramin he
 The livelihood of the people depends on farming
 lekin yahaan sinchai ke saadhan nahin the, lihaaja kisaan pareshaan the or logon kaa palaayan teji se hua
 Except for Kamalapati Tripathi alone in this area, nobody's political will worked here
 kamalapati treepathi ne yahaan naharon kaa jaal bichaaya jisaki vajah se yah purvanchal kaa dhan kaa katoraa kahalaaya
 But after them no one thought it necessary to increase agriculture, education, employment, tourism of this area, in which it is backward
 yahi vajah he ki shuru ke daur main, yani azaadi ke baad 1952 se lekar 1971 bich main ek turm 1967 ko chhod den jisamen socialist party jeet gai thi, nahin to lagaataar chaar baar congress hi yahaan se jitati rahi
 But after 1971, this area constantly changed candidates to improve its condition and direction, but there was no major improvement in its plight
 chunki kisi party ne yahaan ke vikaas main koi bada yogadan nahin diya lihaaja yahaan ke chunaav par hameshaa jaateey ganit hi haaavee rahi
 Chandauli Yadav is a major area whose number is around two lakh seventy five thousand
 uske baad dalit birdari he jo ki kareeb do lakh saath hazaar ke aasapaas he
 Then there are Mauryas in the backward caste whose number is around one lakh seventy five thousand
 brahman, rajput, muslim, rajbhar bhi takreeban ek lakh se kuch adhik hai
 Since Independence till now, if you see which party has won its seat on this seat, then it is the highest Congress which has won from here 6 times
 lekin 1984 ke baad se congress yahaan par jeet kaa swaad nahin chakh pai he to isaki badi vajah kshetreey partiyon kaa udai or jaateey sameekaran hi rahaa he
 Four times after the Congress, the BJP has won its victory from here
 maujuuda samay main bhi yah seat bijepi ke paas he
 SP and Janata Party have won from here twice, while Socialist Party and BSP have won one time
 saal 2014 main chandauli loksabhaa seat par hue chunaav ke samay kul matadaataaon kii sankhya par dhyaan den to vah 15 lakh 93 hajaar 133 thi
 Mahendra Nath Pandey of BJP won this election by getting 4 lakh 14 thousand 135 votes
 duusari ore basapa ke ummidavaar anil kumaar maury ne 2 lakh 57 hajaar 379 vot paae or vah is chunaav main duusare number par rahe
 Along with this, SP candidate Ramkishun received 2 lakh 4 thousand 145 votes and Congress candidate Tarun Patel got 27 Hajar 194 votes
 yani sabhi partiyon ke maton kaa pratishat dekhen to bijepi sabase adhik 42
 The Bahujan Samaj Party won 26 percent of the vote followed by 26
 25 or sapa ko 20
 82 percent of the vote was received
 jabaki congress sirf apni 2
 Only 77 percent of the votes were able to knock
 san 1999 se 2009 tak ke teen chunaav main sapa-basapa aapas main is seat ko ek-duusare se chhinte rahe hai lekin 2014 kii modi lahar main apana dal or rajbhar party se bhaajapa ke gathbandhan ne is seat ko sapa se chin liya tha or takreeban dedh lakh se zyaada maton se bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mahendra pandeya yahaan vijayi hue
 This time again BJP has fielded its state president Mahendra Nath Pandey but this time the equations have changed
 sapa or basapa ke gathbandhan main ye seat sapa ke paas gai he donon ke pichley loksabhaa ke chunaav ke mili maton ke pratishat ko mila de to ye taqarin 47 pratishat hota he jo bijepi ke 42 percent se kahin zyaada he
 Apart from these percentage of votes, bjp's lack of agreement with Om Prakash Rajbhar can also cause big loss to them in this seat
 saafe he ki 2019 main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh chandauli seat par yahaan ke jaateey sameekaran ke chakravyuuh main ghirte nazar aa rahe hai or philhal abhi isko todakar nikalne kaa koi saafe rasta bhi nazar nahin aa rahaa he lekin raajnneeti main kuch bhi sambhav he rigelt kya aayega ye dekhne vaali baat hogi

 Voting was 84 percent, compared to just 47 in the 2009 election
 64 fisad vot pade the
 Dindori Lok Sabha seat came into existence in 2008 after delimitation
 iske baad yahaan 2009 main bijepi ke harishchandra chavaan ne jeet hasil kii
 He was also successful in winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone ensipi kii bharti praveen pavaar ko chunaav haraaya
 Chavan garnered 5,42,784 votes
 jabaki pavaar ko 2,95,165 vot mili
 What is the history of this seat
 
 
 parisemen ke pehle dindori loksabhaa seat maalegaanv kaa hissaa hua karti thi
 At that time it was also called the Janata Dal stronghold
 1957 main praja samaajawaadee party ke yadav narayan jadhav saansad bane
 Then Congress came to power in 1962
 madhav lakshmana jadhav loksabhaa pahunche
 In 1967 and 1971, Jhamru Manglu Kahandol became a Congress ticket MP
 phir 1977 main haribhaau mahale bhartiya lok dal kii tikat se saansad kaa chunaav jite
 But in 1980, Jhamru Manglu Kahandole led the Congress to victory once again
 1984 main congress ke seetaram bhoye jite to 1989 main haribhaau mahale ne janata dal ko vaapasi karwaai
 Kahandole again became MP in 1991
 1996 main kacharu bhaau raaoot ne is seat par bijepi kii entry karwaai
 But in 1998, Jhamru Manglu Kahandole won
 1999 main haribhaau mahale janata dal (S) ko jeet dilaane main safal rahe
 However, in 2004 Harishchandra Chavan won
 iske baad dindori loksabhaa seat ke astitv main aane ke baad 2009 or 2014 main wo dobaaraa yahaan se jeet darj karne main safal hue
 How the ethnic equation changed after delimitation
 
 
 maaloom ho ki dindori gujarat se najadik he
 Because of this, most of the people here are employed in Gujarat
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is bhugolic sthiti ke kaaran yahaan kii raajnneeti par bhi asar hota he
 Dindori is identified as Swami Samarth Spiritual Center and Gurukula
 dharmik jagah hone ke saath-saath yahaan gaavon main aapako aadhuniktaa najar aegi
 But despite this, tribal-dominated areas are struggling for survival
 bataaya jaataa he ki muslim bahul ilaake main ek vakt nihaal ahamed kaa bolbalaa tha
 But after Malegaon joined Dhulia, the equation of this Lok Sabha seat completely changed
 vahiin, surgana or peth main communiston kaa varchasv aaj bhi kaayam he
 The Communist Party takes one to one and a half million votes in every election
 kya he vidhansabha siton kaa itihaas
 
 
 Despite having the Dindori Lok Sabha seat with the BJP, only one MLA is from BJP in the 5 assembly seats here
 yahaan vidhansabha siton par rashtravaadi congress kaa varchasv he
 The Dindori assembly seat is ruled by the Nationalist Congress (NCP), the Communist Party of India (M) in Kalvan, the BJP in Chandvad, the Shiv Sena in Nifad and the NCP over Yevla

 You must have heard and read many things about these relationships of the heart, but now science can also be seen taking interest in this subject and there is evidence of this recent research which is working to connect the heart to the mind
 Huh
 1
 According to research conducted at Kingston University in London, five years after getting divorced, women are happier than men
 kai baar dekha gaya he ki aarthik rup se kamjor mahila bhi tuuti hui shaadi ke baad sukun kii jindagi bitaati he
 On this fact, scientists say that this happens because after divorce, she starts living freely
 2
 If you hesitate to talk about money or become over active then be careful
 kansas state uniwarsity kii research sonya brit kaa kahana he ki paise ko lekar chhidi bahes kai baar talaak tak pahunch jaati he
 3
 arozona uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki pati-patni ke bich bhaavnaatmak bahes main purush hameshaa baat ko khatm karne kii koshish karte hai lekin mahilaayein baat kii jad tak jane kii koshish main us mudde se hat nahin paati hai
 4
 aisa mana jaataa he ki purush sex ke maamle main zyada utsahit rahete hai or vah har samay isi bare main sochate rahete hai
 a study done at Duke University has revealed that both men and women think about sex but women do not like to talk about it openly
 5
 You must have heard about long distance relationships and it is believed that the age of these relationships is short
 lekin haal main is mudde par hue ek research main yah baat saamne ai he ki acerishte lambey samay tak chalate hanore unamem pyaar bhi bana rahata he
 6
 agar aap aisa sochate hai ki dil ke rishte sirf pyaar se banate hai insaan ke chehre se nahin to aapako apni soch badal deni chahie
 According to a report published in the British Journal, men prefer attractive-looking and smart women, but they want a less beautiful wife in marriage
 7
 Most spouses follow the theory of living together, eating and sleeping, but avoid doing so
 toronto study ne haal main paaya ki 30 se 40 pratishat jode alag-alag bistar main sona pasand karte hai
 By doing this, their energy remains and the relationship becomes burdensome
 8
 It is said that men should take initiative in the matter of money themselves, like if you have gone on a date, then pay the bill yourself
 lekin champman uniwarsity main hueek research ke mutabik aisa bilkul nahin hankyonki purushon ko is baat se bahut khiz hoti he
 Now they also want women to start spending money

 Kali Puri, vice-chairman and Conclave Director of India Today Group on the inclusion of Sonia Gandhi in the Conclave, said - 'sonia Gandhi has come a long way in the country's politics after attending the India Today Conclave 14 years ago
 is dauraan unki takat main lagaataar ijapha hota rahaa or desh ko lekar unki samaj or viksit hui, lihaaja is manch par unhen ek baar phir sunanaa behad khaas rahegaa’

 com / kjpjwqfw3u On Wednesday, Congress and BJP targeted each other for referring to Rahul Gandhi in his petition to the United Nations against the repeal of Article 370 and Article 35A in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ke maanavadhikaar mantri shirin majaari ne tivetor par aath pej kaa patr share kiya gaya he, jisamen rahul gandhi ke hawaale se likhaa gaya he ki jammu-kashmir main 'log mar rahe hai
 'the letter addressed to the UN reads,' The incidents of violence have been accepted by mainstream politicians like Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi
 is faisle kii vajah se vahaan bahut galat ho rahaa he
 'but only Rahul Gandhi is not the only Indian leader mentioned in the letter addressed to the U
N
 is patr main haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter or bhajapa vidhayak vikram saini kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 The letter stated that on 10 August 2019, Manohar Lal Khattar issued a statement regarding marrying Kashmiri girls
 mukhyamantri khatter ne fatehabad main maharishi bhagirath jayanti samaaroh ke ek rajya-stareey samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue kathith rup se kaha tha, 'pehle opi dhanakad kehete the ki ham bihar kii ladakiyon ko haryana main shaadi ke liye laaenge
 Now some people are saying that we will bring girls from Kashmir
 lekin majaak ek taraf
 Only after the sex ratio is correct in our society can we balance
 'bhaajapa vidhayak vikram saini ne bhi isi tarah kii tippanee kii thi
 He had said that Muslims in the country should be happy with the abolition of Article 370 as they can now marry "white" Kashmiri girls without any fear
 is bayaan ko lekar pakistan ke patr main vikram saini kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 Let me tell you that, on Wednesday, the BJP attacked the Congress over Rahul Gandhi's latest statement on Jammu and Kashmir, saying that apology to the country for the irresponsible statement which embarrassed the Congress leader and his party to accuse him of violence in Kashmir
 Should be sought, which Pakistan is using on a platform like the United Nations
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki rahul pakistan ke haathon main khel rahe hai or unke bayaan ko padosi desh sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke khilaaf istemaal kar rahaa he or ve man se nahin balki paristhitiyon ke kaaran or jan dabaav main apane bayaan se palate hai
 Information and Broadcasting Minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar told reporters, 'congress has embarrassed the country with its antics
 jis prakaar rahul gandhi ne jammu-kashmir ke bare main tippaniyan kin, wo nindaneey he
 He said that there have been political differences, but no one has ever said or said that Pakistan has used them
 ‘ is tarah kaa gaiyr jimmedaarana raajnneetik vyavhaar pichley 70 varsho main nahin dekha gaya
 Javadekar said that Rahul Gandhi had given a statement that something is not going right in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki vahaan se hinsa kii report aa rahi hai
 We want to ask from where is Rahul Gandhi bringing this information? He said that Rahul Gandhi has given a wrong statement, nothing like this is happening in Jammu and Kashmir
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke bayaan ko saboot banaate hue pakistan ne yuan main ek yachika lagaai he
 This is bankruptcy as well as Congress votebank politics
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki is bayaan se jab deshbhar ke logon kaa gussa saamne aayaa to rahul gandhi ko aaj bayaan se you-turn lenaa padaa

 The initial tenders for this work turned out to be Rs 32 crore 38 lakh, which has been received by Techno Electronics Limited Company
 congress ne is puri prakriya par aapatti uthaate hue isamen golmaal hone kaa daawa kiya he
 The party's Mumbai president Sanjay Nirupam gave a press conference on this matter on Friday
 nirupam ne kaha ki is tender ke jariye jo teb chaatro ko diya ja rahaa he vah outdated or bahut mahangaa he
 Shiv Sena is also buying this product for BMC because the tab is made by Videocon, a company of its Rajya Sabha member Rajkumar Dhoot
 party ne apni aapattiyon ke saath biemasi kamishnar ko kaha he ki vah is tender ko radd karen varanaa iske khilaaf kendriya dakshata ayog main shikaayat kii jaaegi
 The Congress demands that the tab should be studied, but for that, the old tab should not be worn by the students

 The comments is bich videokon company ke emdi venugopal dhoot ne NDTV india se baat karte hue kaha he ki "techno electronics limited is company se na to videokon kaa koi sambandh he na shivasena saansad rajkumaar dhoot kaa
 All the allegations against us are false and baseless

 " khaas baat he ki, teb se padhai kii apni yojana ko lekar aditya haal hi main pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi mili or unhone is yojana ko centre sarkaar se lagu karne kaa aagrah bhi kiya
 On the go, he also handed over his tab to the Prime Minister

 India's current FIFA ranking is 167
 mumkin he nai ranking main bhartiya team 170 ke paar hogi
 Football was in the news after Brazil's World Cup winner Edson Arantes do Nacminto, ie, the football magician Pelé, came to India, but the concern kept growing that what would happen to Indian football? skool str ke bharat ke sabase bade toornament subrato cap ke final main pele kii maujuudagi se dilli ke ambedkar stadium main aane se maahaul meley sa ban gaya
 Football expert Novi Kapadia recalls, “I am well aware of the history of this stadium
 yahaan duniya ke top golkeeper rus ke lev yashin 1950 ke dashak main aae the, phir igore netto (yuasasar) bhi aae, lekin pele kaa to koi muqabla nahin he
 The fans have come to the stadium due to the arrival of Pelé, but the real change will come only when the Indian players get good practice at the international level
 " Khadija Kazmi, an Air Force School football player who came to the stadium to see Pelé in particular, says, "I have become a fan of Pelé after listening to Papa's mouth
 pele shandaar khilaadi rahe hai
 His technique has been very good
 wo kisi se ladate bhi nahin the
 i am very happy " khadija ne is saal subrato cap main bhi hissaa liya or toornament kii shuruyaat se hi wo final match kaa intazaar kar rahi thim, taaki pele ko kareeb se dekh saken
 Another young football player Rohan also says something similar
 wo kehete hai ki skool str ke is toornament ko dekhne pehle itane darshak stadium nahin aate the, lekin pele kii vajah se agar itane darshak aae hai, to unhen skool str ke footbal tallent kaa bhi andaja ho jayega
 The feats of Pelé, the world's biggest name, are myths for today's generation
 you-tub par unke karnaamon kii tasviren sabko hairaan karti rahi hai
 Young fans of the EPL or Spanish League also stunned Pelé's exploits
 pichley kuch dinon se pele ke bhartiya media main surkhiyaan bane rahane se phans ke jehan main ye sawaal bhi uthta rahaa ki bhartiya footbal kis disha main ja rahaa he? raahat kii baat he ki lambey samay baad jaankaar ummid jagaa rahe hai, kyonki, ab grass root level se hi footbal ko thik karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Novi Kapadia says that for the first time an attempt is being made to teach football in the same style at the under-17 or under-15 level
 pehali baar under-15 yaa under-17 str par bhi antarrashtriya club jaisi footbal khel rahe hai
 Children are being trained to play 4-3-3 or 4-2-2

 The overnight change in Indian football is not possible with the arrival of Pelé, but the fans are definitely hoping for a start
 footbal ke jaadugar pele kaa dilli ke ambedkar stadium main aana ek aitihaasik ghatana he, lekin bhartiya footbal tantra iskaa kitna phayda uthaa paaegaa, ye kah paanaa behad mushkil he

 skool str ke bharat ke sabase bade toornament subrato cap ke final main pele kii maujuudagi se dilli ke ambedkar stadium main aane se maahaul meley sa ban gaya
 Football expert Novi Kapadia recalls, “I am well aware of the history of this stadium
 yahaan duniya ke top golkeeper rus ke lev yashin 1950 ke dashak main aae the, phir igore netto (yuasasar) bhi aae, lekin pele kaa to koi muqabla nahin he
 The fans have come to the stadium due to the arrival of Pelé, but the real change will come only when the Indian players get good practice at the international level
 " Khadija Kazmi, an Air Force School football player who came to the stadium to see Pelé in particular, says, "I have become a fan of Pelé after listening to Papa's mouth
 pele shandaar khilaadi rahe hai
 His technique has been very good
 wo kisi se ladate bhi nahin the
 i am very happy " khadija ne is saal subrato cap main bhi hissaa liya or toornament kii shuruyaat se hi wo final match kaa intazaar kar rahi thim, taaki pele ko kareeb se dekh saken
 Another young football player Rohan also says something similar
 wo kehete hai ki skool str ke is toornament ko dekhne pehle itane darshak stadium nahin aate the, lekin pele kii vajah se agar itane darshak aae hai, to unhen skool str ke footbal tallent kaa bhi andaja ho jayega
 The feats of Pelé, the world's biggest name, are myths for today's generation
 you-tub par unke karnaamon kii tasviren sabko hairaan karti rahi hai
 Young fans of the EPL or Spanish League also stunned Pelé's exploits
 pichley kuch dinon se pele ke bhartiya media main surkhiyaan bane rahane se phans ke jehan main ye sawaal bhi uthta rahaa ki bhartiya footbal kis disha main ja rahaa he? raahat kii baat he ki lambey samay baad jaankaar ummid jagaa rahe hai, kyonki, ab grass root level se hi footbal ko thik karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Novi Kapadia says that for the first time an attempt is being made to teach football in the same style at the under-17 or under-15 level
 pehali baar under-15 yaa under-17 str par bhi antarrashtriya club jaisi footbal khel rahe hai
 Children are being trained to play 4-3-3 or 4-2-2
 ye bachche jab senior team main aaenge, to antarrashtriya str par inhen khilne main aasaani hogi
 The commentsscott o'donnell (of Australia), technical director of the bhartiya footbal sangh ke takneekee nideshak scot o donnelle (australia ke) kehete hai, "main koshish kar rahaa hum ki bhartiya footbal kaa style badal sakuun
 The AIFF Under-17 team also performed well in the Subroto Cup final

 pele ko khaas taur par dekhne stadium ain airforce skool kii footbal khilaadi khadija kaazmi kahati hai, "papa ke munh se sunakar main pele kii fain ho gai hum
 Pelé has been a great player
 unki takanic bahut acchhee rahi he
 He did not even fight with anyone
 main bahut khush hum
 "khadija also took part in the Subroto Cup this year and from the start of the tournament she was waiting for the final match so that Pelé could get a closer look
 kuch aisi hi baat ek or yuva footbal khilaadi rohan bhi kehete hai
 He says that not many visitors had come to the stadium before to see this school level tournament, but if Pelé has seen so many visitors, he will also get an idea of the school level football talent
 footbal kii duniya ke sabase bade naam pele ke karname aaj kii peedi ke liye mithkon jaise hai
 Pictures of his adventures on youtube have surprised everyone
 ipiel yaa spanish lig ke yuva phans ko bhi pele ke karname dang kar dete hai
 With Pelé making headlines in the Indian media for the last few days, the question has also arisen in the minds of the fans that in which direction Indian football is going? It is a matter of relief that after a long time, the experts are raising hope, because now, the grass root level is trying to fix the football itself
 novi kapadia kehete hai ki pehali baar under-17 yaa under-15 ke str par ek hi style se footbal sikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 For the first time they are playing international club-like football even at the under-15 or under-17 level
 bacchon ko 4-3-3 yaa 4-2-2 se khilne kii training di ja rahi he
 When these children come in the senior team, they will be easy to play at international level
 tippaniyan Scott o'donnell (of Australia), technical director of the Indian Football Association, says, "I am trying to change the style of Indian football
 subrato cap ke final match main bhi AIFF kii under-17 team ne acha pradarshan kiya
 "he believes that the Indian team under German coach Nikolai Adam is preparing brilliantly for the Under-17 World Cup to be held in India in 2017
 wo kehete hai ki iskaa asar das saal baad jarur dekhne ko milegaa, jab These players will be seen showing their strength at the international level
 pele ke aane se bhartiya footbal main ratorat badlaav kaa hona katai mumkin nahin, lekin phans shuruyaat ke phaayde kii ummid jarur kar rahe hai
 Football magician Pelé's arrival at Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi is a historic event, but it is very difficult to say how much the Indian football system will be able to benefit from it
 footbal kaa shahenshaah chaahe dilli main hon, lekin bhartiya footbal kii antarrashtriya kamyaabi ke liye dilli behad dur he
 For the time being, one has to be patient for the outcome

 iraq main bandhakbanaae gaye 39 bhartiya abhi tak jinda hai
 This claim has been made by the English newspaper 'the Sunday Guardian'
 report main pakistan ke aatanki sanghathan taharik-e-taliban (titipi) ke sutron ke hawaale se yah jaankaree di gai he
 In June this year, the terrorist organization 'islamic State of Iraq and Syria' (ISIS) was taken hostage in the city of Mosul, Iraq
 akhbaar kii report ke mutabik titipi ke sutara ne shanivaar ko islamic state commander se do baar baat kii thi
 Both times it was said by ISIS that all Indians are alive and in ISIS possession
 akhbaar kaa kahana he ki vah is sambandh main iesas se bhi sampark karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Significantly, the TTP is one of the terrorist organizations that first announced to support ISIS
 agava bharatiyon par sushamaa swaraj kaa bayanisse pehle videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne loksabhaa or rajyasabha main is mudde par kaha tha sarkaar kaa bandhakon se philhal sidhaa sampark nahin he, lekin chah sutron kaa daawa he ki ve jivit hai
 However, the government has no concrete evidence about the hostages being alive or dead
 sushamaa ne kaha tha,' sari khabaren us harjit messiah ke bayaan par aadhaarit hai, jiske bayanon main kaaphi virodhabhas he, jabaki sarkaar ke sampark vaale sutron ne guuruuvaar raat tak yah daawa kiya he ki bhartiya bandhak jivit hai
 He said that the government has two options - the first is to stop searching for those 39 people by relying on Harjeet's statement
 jabaki doosraa yah he ki ham un chah sutron kii baat par bharosa kar talash jari rakhen, jinhone guuruuvaar raat tak yah daawa kiya he ki bandhak banaae gaye 39 bhartiya jivit hai
 The Supreme Court on Monday while hearing a petition opposing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the retail sector, said that if the government formulates a policy that does not get the approval of Parliament, it will do so at its own risk
 nyaayamurti aar
 M
 lodha or nyaayamurti anil aar
 Dave's bench said, "the executive has been given the right to govern
 yah use dekhnaa he ki vah ise kaise anjaam detii he or yadi vah samvidhan kaa ullandhan karti he, to nyaayalay hastkshep karegaa
 The government had made a statement that it has made necessary amendments in the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and RBI regulations to implement multi-brand FDI in retail
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki sarkaar kii aarthik niti main hastkshep karne main nyaayalay ko saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 He, however, said that he was not saying that the entire economic policy of the government was beyond judicial review
 nyaayamurti lodha ne kaha, 'hamane yah nahin kaha he ki (sarkaar kii) sampurna aarthik niti sanvaidhanik samiksha se pare he, lekin adaalat ko (aarthik nitiyon main) hastkshep karne main atyadhik mandatha or parhez baratani chahie or jab tak ki yah un mulyon kaa ullandhan nahin kare, jo samvidhan main sthapit hai or samvidhan kii lay or aatma se iskaa virodh na ho
 The NGO Swadeshi Jagran Foundation, opposing multi-brand FDI in retail, said that it is against the principles of social and economic justice
 adaalat ne is yachika ko adaalat main abhiyojit kiye jane kii anumati nahin di
 The next hearing of the case will be on 22 January

 poochtacha ke dauraan shouri ne kaha ki 2005 main tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri dayaanidhi maaran ne kuch operataron ko phayda pahunchane ke liye bhartiya doorsanchaar viniamak praadhikaran (tri) ke disha nirdeshon kaa ulanghan kiya
 After an interrogation of about three hours, Shourie told reporters that he presented several such instances of alleged irregularities in front of the authorities which a
 raja dwaara doorsanchaar mantri kaa pad sanbhaalane se pehle maaran ke kaarykaal main hue
 Shourie said 'maran was a minister
 raja par kis baat kaa aarope he? spectrum ke bagaiyr ye 122 license dena, jab sarkaar ke paas spectrum tha hi nahin
 But it happened during Maran that a line was inserted in the guideline that there would be no restriction on the number of operators in any one circle
 ’purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki aise badlaav sirf tri kii siforeeshon ke rup main aa sakate hai
 Shourie was the Telecom Minister from January 2003 to May 2004 during the NDA rule
 sibiai ke mutabik pehle aao pehle paao ke aadhaar par kareeb 50 license die gaye tathaa bharti, vodaphone or idia is niti se laabh paane waalon main shaamil the
 Shourie said, 'I was given the ministry in the year 2003
 varsh 2001 ke dishanirdeshon ke mutabik pehle aao pehle paao kii niti kaaphi spasht thi
 All the arguments of this government are absurd
 ’ purv doorsanchaar mantri shivaraj patil samiti kii report par bhi barase or kaha ki ye log khud hi dastavejon ko nahin dekh sakate
 He said that the government is diverting attention from the real issues
 unhone kaha, ‘media jahaan udyogpatiyon or karporate ke sibiai ke paas aane kii khabaron ko cover kar rahi he vahiin pradhanmantri kaa kahin naam nahin he, em karunanidhi kaa kahin naam nahin he
 The names of other Congress members are also not known
 ’ baharhaal shouri ne sibiai kii prashansa karte hue kaha ki agar ise swatantra chhod diya jaae to yah sakasham sanghathan he
 The former telecom minister said that he has come to the CBI headquarters to give all possible help to the investigating agency and to answer all the questions that come to his knowledge and give records to him
 shouri ne kaha ki unhone maamle ke tathyon ko sibiai ke samaksh rakhaa or ghotaale ke bare main sari jaankaree dene vaale vyakti ko agency se milwaaya
 Shourie said, "according to my information, he definitely met the person
 unhone uske saath kai baithken kin or us aadhaar par kaam kiya
 So when the court took up the case, the CBI was able to work faster when the CAG report came
 kyonki iske paas logon ke naam, unke number jaisi sabhi vistrut jaankariyaan thim
 When asked about Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement on coalition politics, Shourie said, "now that Raja is in jail, has there been any effect on the alliance?" dramuk kii baadhyataaon ko kyon nahin dekhte ? ve centre sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin ja sakate

 ) On the 25th of November, the ninth of the functioning of the JD (U) government and within hours of presenting its first report card, Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi reached Patna's neighboring district of Jehanabad
 vahaan ke gandhi maidan main jedy(you) kaaryakartaaon kii baithak main unhen purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa abhivadan karne ke liye manch se utarate dekha gaya
 Manjhi handing Nitish his chair on the stage repeatedly requested him to sit
 yah pehali baar tha jab maanjhi ne 13 november se shuru hue jedy(you) ke sampark yatra abhiyaan main nitish ke saath manch saajha kiya
 Manjhi calls Nitish his' elder brother ', whom he' will never betray
 'maanjhi kii yah kavayad samajhi ja sakati he
 In fact, many party ministers and legislators are demanding the removal of Manjhi from the Chief Minister's post
 jahiraa taur par apni kavayad ke jariye ve jedy (you) ke mukhya vichaarak nitish ko khush karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 On the issue of Manjhi's rhetoric before leaving for the Sampark Yatra a day earlier, Nitish said, "we will talk on it after the 29th
" ''sampark yatra 29 november ko khatm hone vaali he
 Whereas before this, he has been publicly refusing to say anything on the statements of Manjhi, who created a flutter for the party
 nitish ke bayaan ke 24 ghante ke bheetar hi maanjhi unke saamne maujuud the
 He described Nitish as 'lord Krishna' and described himself as 'laxman'
 party sutron kii maane to maanjhi ko jab yah lagane laga ki unhen hataane kii maang par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he to unhone nitish ko khush karne kii koshish shuru kar di he
 Earlier, in a conversation with India Today on November 24, Manjhi expressed full confidence that he had the trust of Nitish
 ''unako mujh par puraa vishwaas he
 We both have a mutual understanding of it
 unki ore se koi gadabadi ho rahi he to ham baat karenge yaa hamaari ore se koi gadabadi ho rahi he to ve baat karenge
 When we are not talking to them and they are not talking to us, then understand that what is happening is going on
 ve party kaa kaam kar rahe hai or main sarkaar kaa
 But the manner in which he appeared bending before Nitish in Jehanabad, it is clear that the confidence he was showing in running the government and the party general secretary and chief spokesperson
 si
 Ignoring Tyagi's suggestions, he has now started withdrawing
 tyaagi ne unhen saarvajanik bayaan dete samay samajhadaari baratane kaa suzav diya tha
 Tyagi's suggestion was believed to have been cleared by the party's top leadership
 maanjhi ne unke suzav ko darkinar kar diya tha kyonki ve sirf nitish or sharad yadav ko hi party kaa sabase bada netaa maanate hai
 Manjhi rejected this suggestion without naming anyone, saying, "whatever will come in my mind, i will not hesitate to speak
" jo log mujhe suzav de rahe hai, main unase zyada budhimaan hum
 "actually Manjhi is getting this power from the unique position of the grand alliance
 ve jaanate hai ki rashtriya janata dal (argedy) pramukh lalu prasad yadav kii manjuuri ke bina unhen mukhyamantri kii kursi se nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 Lalu is constantly in touch with Manjhi
 lalu kii sahmati ke bina unhen hataanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki jedy(you) sarkaar ke liye argedy ke 24 vidhayakon kaa samarthan behad ahm he
 When JD (U) or any RJD leader did not try to defend Manjhi over the disputed statements, it was Lalu who came forward to defend her and said that what Manjhi has said is a historical fact
 11 november ko maanjhi ne savarnon ko baahar se aae aaryon kaa vanshaj or adivaasiyon tathaa daliton ko bharat kaa mul nivasee bataaya tha
 Tyagi had suggested to Manjhi to take precaution on this statement
 maanjhi yah bhi jaanate hai ki ve sirf lalu par nirbhar nahin rah sakate
 a section of the JD (U) suggested replacing Nitish in front of the top leadership
 isse nitish aktubar, 2015 main hone vaale agle vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle dobaaraa mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 This can only happen when Lalu and Congress approve it
 jedy(you) ke ek varg ne nitish ke naam par aam sahmati nahin banane par plan-bi ke tahat maanjhi kii jagah kisi duusare netaa ko mukhyamantri banane kaa suzav bhi diya tha
 Nitish is not against this plan
 ve kah chuke hai ki unhen apane kaam ke liye 'mazdooree' (janata kaa sahyog) milti he to ve phir mukhyamantri banane ko taiyaar hai
 Although Manjhi has many times accepted Nitish as the JD (U) supremo, he himself can be heavily damaged by his aggressive Dalit politics if he is removed
 party ko dar he ki unki jagah agar nitish ko laayaa gaya to bijepi mahadalit vot bank main send laga sakati he
 The party is also fearing that the assembly elections in the state have been reduced for more than a year and it needs to perform well at the ground level, which does not appear to be happening at the moment
 siem pad se hataae jane par maanjhi apni aakraamak dalit raajnneeti se jedy(you) ko haani pahunchaa sakate hai, jiskaa phayda bijepi uthaa sakati he

 abhi tak is sankraman se 46 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 On this issue, the Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today reprimanded some states for not taking the programs of the spread of swine flu in the country, and the National Rural Health Mission, and said that instead of just feeding Understand your responsibility and responsibility towards society
 bharat main mritkon kii sankhya 46chennai main bhi ek 50 saal ke vyakti kii maut ho gai
 Meanwhile, four more deaths from swine flu have been confirmed in Bangalore
 ye chaaron mahilaayein hai
 Three of them died between 16 and 18 August
 iske saath hi desh bhad main swine flu se marane waalon kii taadaad 46 ho gai he
 On the other hand, this is the 17th death due to swine flu in Pune
 philhal sasoon aspataal main is beemaari se peedit 24 marijon kaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 The condition of five is said to be critical
 har sambhav madad kar rahi he centreazad ne nai dilli main rajyon ke swasthyamantriyon kii baithak kii adhyakshata karte hue kaha ki centre sarkaar desh main swine flu ke prasar, niyantran or rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (enarechaem) ke kaaryakramon ko puri gambhirtha se lete hue sabhi rajyon ko har prakaar kii sahaayta uplabdh kara rahi he
 Sometimes their ministry helps the states even beyond their limits, but on the other hand some states are not understanding their responsibilities and they are only doing so in this direction
 maamle ko gambhirtha se len rajya sarkaarazad ne kaha ki rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan ke kaaryakramon kii anek deshon ne saraahna kii he or apane yahaan bhi isi tarah ke kaarykram shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he lekin hamaare desh main hi kuch aise bhi rajya he jo enarechaem ke kaaryakramon ko gambhirtha se nahin le rahe he or na hi samay par lagu kar rahe hai
 Some states have reduced the amount spent in the health sector while health is a state subject
 rajyon se nahin mil rahe hai apekshit sahyogisi tarah se sarkaar swine flu ke niyantran ke liye har sambhav prayaas kar rahi he or is disha main usne jo thos kadam uthaaye he unke parinaam saamne aa rahe he lekin isamen kuch rajyon kaa sahyog nahin mil rahaa he
 They want that the responsibility of its control rests only with the central government and they can only help in this, but they forget that health is a state subject
 rajya apni jimmedaari bhul rahe hanazad ne swine flu niyantran ke bare main kaha ki centre kii bhi sahaayta karne kii apni seemaa he or vah is disha main apni seemaa se adhik sahaayta kar rahe he
 State governments should also consider their social responsibility and take steps to control it
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar rajyon ke doctoron ko iske liye vishesh prashikshan de rahaa he
 He is providing adequate amount of medicines to them, but on the other hand some state governments have forgotten their responsibilities
 swasthya mantri ne kaha ki kuch samay pehle unhone sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon or pramukh sachivon ko patr likhaa tha or swine flu ke sambandh main kuch aspataalon or prayogshaalaon kaa chayan karne ko kaha tha lekin adhikansh rajyon ne isamen ruchi nahin dikhaayi
 The Center sent the team after that, Cabinet Secretary KM Chandrasekhar took this seriously and prepared a list of around 35 Joint and Additional Secretaries of various ministries and sent one officer to each state and union territory for screening there
 Examine and assist in the testing of samples and the facilities being provided to its patients
 rajya jimmedaari se kaam karenunhone kaha ki swine flu ek nayaa virus he abhi iske bare main puri jaankaree bhi uplabdh nahin he centre ne iske niyantran main jo kadam uthaaye he unke achche parinaam saamne aayen
 If the states also understand their responsibility and work, then surely we will be successful in preventing the spread of this disease

 In fact, she has returned from Phuket after completing the shooting of the film One Night Stand and will proceed from here to Bangalore, where she is to shoot the item song for a big-budget regional language film

 About South's film industry, Sunny says that "there is no hidden agenda
" ' samay kii pabandi or 'har baat kaa khulaa or spasht hona' bhi uski khaasiyat hai
 But Bollywood is quite the opposite, where "nothing is told clearly in advance" and in such a situation, they have to do forced work
 sani bataati hai, ''logon ko lagata he ki mujhe kisi bhi baat par aapatti nahin hogi
 but it's not like that
 main aurat hum or meraa bhi atmasamman he
 i have come here so that i can start a new life

 '' But the word 'item song' is not negative for me in any sense
 '' haalanki unhen yah samaj nahin aata ki duusare log ise galat kyon maanate hai
 He believes that the item song is not just associated with Helen or Silk Smita
 is tarah ke sang or dance to bollywood kii pahchaan hai
 Sunny says, "when i tell the people of America that i am shooting a Bollywood film, they first talk about the song, dance and colorful sets and not the plot of the film
" '' sani ke mutabik, sabase badi mushkil bhi yahi he jabaki asaliyat yah he ki unke or duusari abhinetriyon ke paas item sang ke dheron ofer hai

 darasal haal hi main vidhansabha satr ke dauraan saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ke mantri doctor govind singh ne un sarkari shikshakon kii suchi jari kii jinhen vidhayakon ke nijee staff ke taur par atech kiya gaya he
 Most of these government teachers are attached to Congress mlas
 madhyapradesh main sarkari shikshakon ko vidhayakon ke saath atech karne par kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 Aajtak investigated the shortage of teachers in government schools in Rajgarh and Harda districts and found that about 157 children study in the government school of Semali Kalan in Rajgarh but there is not a single government teacher in the school
 puraa skool atithi shikshakon ke bharose chal rahaa he
 Shortage of teachers: If the teacher who teaches in the government school of Semali Kalan in Rajgarh believes that the result of the school is also affected
 vahiin harda ke sigon main sanchalit madhyamik vidhyalay kaa haal bhi kuch alag nahin he
 There is also a shortage of teachers here and to overcome this, the teacher who has been posted by the department has to teach mathematics, English and science despite not knowing
 darasal, madhyapradesh main kareeb 4,500 skool bina kisi niyamit shikshak ke chal rahe hai
 There is a shortage of 2,844 regular teachers in Rajgarh district
 harda main 1600 niyamit shikshakon kii kami he to vahiin 54 skool bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai
 Actually, it is necessary to have one teacher for every 30 children under the right to education, but there are many schools in Madhya Pradesh where there are no teachers and the education work is going on with the guest teachers
 nagda se congress vidhayak dilip singh gurjar bhi un vidhayakon main se ek hai jinke staff main sarkari shikshak swaroop narayan chaturvedi kii niyukti kii gai he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, the MLA himself is speaking that he has got this appointment done by his choice
 vidhayak kaa kahana he ki shikshak hamaare kshetra or hamaare logon ko bakhubi jaanate hai isliye inhen saath main liya he
 Appointment was made in the Shivraj government as well
 Let me tell you that in 2009, the then Shivraj government had removed the order and prohibited the appointment of government teachers for non-academic work under the Right to Education
 lekin us dauraan bhi shikshakon ko vidhayakon ke nijee staff ke taur par niyukt kiya janaa jari rahaa
 However, the appointment of teachers as personal staff of mlas is not considered wrong by General Administration Department Minister Dr
 Govind Singh
 ajtak se baat karte hue unhone bataaya ki shivaraj sarkaar main niti bhale hi bani thi lekin usamen tab kii sarkaar ne amal nahin kiya
 Therefore, the old tradition was maintained by the Kamal Nath government as well
 vahiin mantri ne lipikon kii bhartee naa hona bhi isaki ek badi vajah bataai he
 BJP has raised questions, while the BJP has attacked the Kamal Nath government for attaching government teachers with legislators
 shivaraj sarkaar main mantri rahe vishwaas saarang ne sarkaar se aadesh waapas lene kii maang ke saath shikshakon ko waapas skool main padhaane ke aadesh dene ko kaha he
 If we go to school, we will study more, India will only grow, through slogans like India, the government seems to be filling the power of bringing children to school, but they are forgetting that when there are no teachers in the schools, the children will neither be able to study nor will India grow Will get congress ne launch kiya 'pehle report phir vot' abhiyanhooda ne khatter sarkaar par lagaae naakaami ke kai aropaharyana main vidhansabha chunaav kii ghanti baj chuki he or sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne apane-apane str par chunaav prachaar shuru bhi kar die hai to aarope-pratyarope kaa khel bhi shuru ho gaya he

 Hooda was accompanied by Shailaja Kumari, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Captain Ajay Randeep and Dipendra Singh Hooda
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne apni sarkaar kii vartmaan sarkaar se tulana karte hue kaha ki pehle rajya main pastiside or fertilizer par koi tex nahin lagata tha lekin ab lagane laga he
 He even said that diesel used to be cheaper than Delhi in Haryana at one time, but now it has become expensive here
 kisaanon kii badahaali kaa zikr karte hue purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki rajya ke kisaanon ke liye MSP kii badi samasya he
 Take mustard or paddy, yet the purchase has not been started

 Will the Congress return? He said that during his reign, the government gave a lot of land to the Dalits, but tell Khattar the name of a village where he has given a lot to the Dalits
 hooda ne kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ne vaada kiya tha ki sarkari karmchaariyon ko punjab rajya ke baraabar vetan denge, yahaan to abhi HRA hi baaki he jiskaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya
 This senior Congress leader alleged that the law and order situation in the state has completely deteriorated and collapsed in BJP

 pichley ek hafte se sirsa main deraa daali hui sibiai ko deraa sachcha sauda ke pramukh babagurmeet ram rahimake khilaaf kuch ahm saboot haath lage hai
 According to 'mail Today' sources, the last time the CBI went to Sirsa, it had to return empty-handed
 lekin is baar deraa bhakton ko samuhik rup se napunsak banane sambandhi ahm saboot sibiai ke haath lage hai
 Last time, under the pressure of the dera, the victims did not cooperate in the CBI investigation
 is maamle main pramukh gavaah ourdera sachcha saudake purv samarthak hans raaj chouhan ko punjab va haryana hoicourt main bhi pesh kiya ja chukaa he
 Talking to Mail Today, he said that most of the victims of the dera have been threatened with life, so they are not opening their mouths against Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 kuch logon ko saamaajik dar bhi he, ki kahin isse samaaj main unki izzat kharaab naa ho jaae
 According to sources, Hans Raj Chauhan has once again recorded his statement with the CBI, but he refused to talk about it
 sibiai ke guptcharon ne kuch purv deraa bhakton se mulaakaat kii he
 During this time he also found some people who were impotent in the name of God in the dera
 inamen se kuch logon ne to jeudicial magistrate ke saamne apane bayaan darj karne kii bhi hami bhar di he
 The CBI is coming to Delhi with these people, because the case has been registered in Delhi itself
 sutron ke anusaar sibiai inke bayanon kii videography karaane kaa man bana rahi he, taaki adaalat main jane par ve mukar naa paaen
 Apart from this, CBI had also visited Gurusar Ram Rahim's ancestral village Gursar Modia in Hanuman Garh district of Rajasthan, where he questioned the doctors and staff of a hospital run by Dera

 Hans Raj in his petition has accused Gurmeet Ram Rahim of luring him and 400 other devotees to seduce Baba and said that this would lead him to meet God directly
 "meraa naam monica levinsky he
 Although i have been asked many times to change my name
 kai baar poocha gaya ki ab tak kyon nahin badla, lekin maine nahin badla
 i am the first person to lose his respect through online sharing, while Facebook, Twitter were not there at that time, but e-mail and news websites were still there
 main jab bhi tivi dekhati, jab bhi online jaati, mujhe gandi gaaliyon se nawaazne vaale logon kii bharmaar thi
 My name used to be in clunky songs
 bas ek hi baat kaanon main goonjati thi - main maranaa chaahati hum (I want to die)
 " 16 saal baad 'forbs' ke ek kaarykram ke dauraan monica levinsky media se jab mukhaatib huin, tab aapbeetee sunaate hue apane aansu nahin roak paayin
 Yes, this is the same Monica Lewinsky who made headlines in 1998 because of her love affair with US President Bill Clinton
 monica mahaz 22 saal kii thim, jab white house main intern ke taur par kaam karne lagi thim
 i have always been troubled by the fact that when two people were equal in this entire episode, on their own free will, why did Monica suffer the punishment alone
 ek aadmi ne apni shaadi main dhokhaa kiya, lekin unki patni hillari clinton ne unka saath diya

 This is a great example of how judgmental people are towards girls

 Deepika Padukone's vogue video has been going viral on social media since so many days
 isaki aalochana karne main mahilaayein bhi peeche nahin hai
 Though it was a very bad video due to the very poor script and weak screenplay, but as far as i feel, its message was to reduce judgmental towards women
 kaash, ise thodaa behatar likhaa gaya hota
 i fail to understand how women's empowerment is associated with "my Choice"
 aap shaadi karnaa chahen yaa naa karnaa chahen, ye aapaki ichha ho sakati he
 But whether you choose to marry or not to marry, how can you impose this decision on other people associated with this marriage
 beshak aapkaa odhana-pahananaa, chalanaa phirana, kaam karnaa aapaki apni ichha he
 But with the same logic, you cannot call a woman wearing a burqa, a vermilion, a woman who spends at home, because she will also say - "my Choice"
 aap apni is ghatiya script se mahilaon kii ladaai kamazor kar rahi hai
 Women's empowerment means only one to me - self-respect
 agar aap apane aatm-sammaan ke liye apane pati, apane maa-baap or apni kamazoriyon se lard sakati hai, to aap bilkul ek shashakt mahila hai
 But you keep killing your self-esteem because of your sentimentality, kill someone, tolerate cheating, hurting the honor of another girl, then despite wearing a dress and earning a lot of money, Deepika Padukone or Hillary Clinton is also an ordinary woman
 agar aap "maay chois" ke naam par dogali baaten karti hai, to aap bahut hi aasaan rasta akhriyaar kiye hue hai or maaf kijiyegaa is hisaab se is desh main aapse behatar mahilaayein maujuud hai
 You are not able to deliver this kind of message through any advertisement
 agar aap sahi main ek shashakt mahila hai, to phir apni sharton par film industry main kaam karke dikhaaiye
 Refuse to be the product of the market
 har galat baat par apni awaz uthaaiye
 The middle path leads nowhere
 is kamazor video kii vajah se kuch purushon ko mauka mil gaya or wo apni kism kii video ke zariye mahilaon ko barabari kii sabak sikhaane lage
 You should teach a lesson when you understand what it is like
 aaj hi apni ek mitra kaa post padhaa
 If a boy stares at a girl, he may not mind it, but staring at a boy can make a girl uncomfortable
 kis tarah se samaaj balaatkaar ke liye ladakiyon ko doshi tehraata he or ladakon ko nahin, ye baat bhi apane sangyaan main rakhiye
 The day you start accepting that the work you name your pleasure and women can also name it fun instead of shame, then you must raise the flag of equality
 mahila shashaktikaran kaa sara mudda filhal purushon kii barabari par focus ho gaya he
 In this affair, you forget that the character of men you hate, you slowly start becoming the same
 phir ye ladaai kisase he
 i do not think that Feminism can be learned by reading in a book
 har mahila pehle apni zindagi padhe or phir use kisi se feminism seekhney kii zarurat nahin padegi
 Because your journey was not normal
 jis ladki ne apni jaan dene kii bajaay kai saalon tak us beizzati ko jhela or apana naam nahin badla, shaayad wo america kii sabase shaktishaalee mahila ko feminism siikhaa sakati he
 The habit of smsing on mobile phones is making the youth ill
 udyog sanghathan asocham ne ek adhyayan main yah nishkarsh nikaala he
 It said that with the facility of smsing in various packages or schemes of telecom companies at cheaper rates, it may have become the preferred communication medium of the youth, but it is also causing many health problems in them
 adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki text miseging (esemes) desh ke zyaadaatar yuvaaon kaa samvaad kaa pasandida tarika he
 Accordingly, 60 percent of India's mobile user youth send or receive an average of 125 SMS a day to communicate in their group, but due to this they have been exposed to health problems like insomnia, depression, loss of appetite, isolation
 report main kaha gaya he ki is tarah kii gatividhiyon main lambey samay tak lage rahane par brain tumor sahit kai gambhir bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai

 ) tab dilli main naa metro kii raftaar thi, naa fliover kii baadh
 Na Chamchama Airport Na Damkata Railway Station
 puraani dilli bhi tab waisi hi puraani hi thi or usee puraani dilli se use uthaaya gaya tha
 This is the story of 18-year-old Aamir living in Teliwada area of old Delhi
 14 saal baad jab wo aaazaad hua to dilli kii surat hi nahin puri dilli badal chuki he
 But he himself could not witness this change
 kyonki uski jindagi ke sabase khubasurat 14 saal usase chin kar salaakhon ko de die gaye the, jail kii salaakhon ko
 Those bars are now broken, the rest of his age has also been returned to him
 par sawaal yahi he ki kya uske beete hue wo 14 saal, wo 5110 din koi lautaa paaegaa?baat 1996-97 kii he
 In these two years, there were a total of 22 blasts at different dates and times in Delhi, UP and Haryana
 ye dhamaake sadak par, bazaar main, restaraan, bason main yahaan tak ki train main bhi hue
 The terrorists and bomb experts in Bangladesh and Pakistan, Abdul Karim Tunda and some other terrorist organizations were blamed for these blasts
 dhamaakon kii tafteesh dilli police kii special cell kar rahi thi, par do saal biit gaye or uske haath khaali the
 Then came the night of 20 February 1998, which changed Aamir's life
 puraani dilli ke teliwada ilaake main rahane vaala 18 saal kaa aamir dawa lene ke liye ghar se baahar niklaa tha
 It is usually difficult to get someone from Old Delhi like this
 kyonki yahaan log der raat tak jaage hote hai, dukaane khuli rahati hai
 But here everything happened so quickly that by the time someone could understand something, the gypsy had left
 aamir ko ab tak yahi gumaan tha ki shaayad use kisi ne agava kar liya he
 But once he got out of the car, he had understood everything
 saat dinon tak aamir ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se police hiraasat main rakhaa gaya
 During this time all the atrocities were done on him
 usase jabaran sade kagajaat par dastakhat karaae gaye
 During this, the family members of Aamir were constantly looking for their son
 unhen pataa hi nahin tha ki unke bete ko koun log or kahaan uthaa kar le gaye hai? unhen to ye khabar 28 farvari ko mili
 When his son's name appeared in the newspaper headlines
 aamir ke alaava police ne ek or ladke ko uthaaya tha, uskaa naam mohammad shakeel tha
 He was described as Aamir's partner
 jaahir he aamir ke gharavaalon ke saath-saath puri puraani dilli ko is khabar ne chaunkaa diya tha
 Aamir was accused of more explosions than his age
 umr se zyada cese uske sir par the
 Aamir's life had changed in a moment
 jab use uthaaya gaya tab wo 11veen kaksha main tha
 But in one stroke, now that student had been made a terrorist
 par kyon? aakhir aamir hi kyon? use hi kyon uthaaya gaya? usee ke sir 22 dhamaakon kaa iljaam kyon laga? itane bhare-puure shahar main police kisi or ko bhi uthaa sakati thi? to aamir hi kyon? kya uskaa koi purana criminal ricard tha? yaa pakistan yaa bangladesh se koi conection? aaj tak ne pataa kiya to pataa chalaa ki aamir kii bahan kii shaadi pakistan main hui he
 This was his relationship with Pakistan
 lekin sirf pakistan se, pakistan main baithe aatankwaadi sanghathanon se nahin
 Aaj Tak researched Aamir's previous life
 hamen pataa chalaa ki uskaa koi criminal becoground nahin tha
 Then why was the police caught Aamir? We asked this question to Aamir only
 iljaam itnaa bada or khaufnak tha ki aamir kaa puraa parivaar tut gaya
 Leave neighbors, even your loved ones have opted out of Aamir's family
 aamir ke pita kaa chota-motaa bijness tha
 He used to make toys for children, he used to live in the house
 bete par sabase bada iljaam laga tha
 The police had done their work by calling Aamir a terrorist
 ab aamir ko sabit karnaa tha ki wo aatankwaadi nahin balki ek stodend he or begunaahi muft main sabit nahin hoti
 Court-court lawyer costs for this
 baap ne bete ke cese ke liye apana sab kuch jhunk diya
 The toy itself was smashing its own most beloved toy to put a smile on the faces of the children of others
 court-kachhari ke chakkar kaatane ke baad khilone banane ke liye vakt bhi kahaan bachaa tha
 Therefore, the financial condition of the house became crispy
 bete ke gam ne baap ko kuch is kadar tod diya ki aamir kii giraftaar ke teen saal baad hi aamir ke walid kii maut ho gai
 See unfortunate that Aamir could not even soil his father, because he was in jail
 magar haa, marane se pehle tihaad main jab uske pita usase milane aae the tab unhone jo kuch usase kaha tha wo use aaj bhi yaad he
 After the death of Aamir's father, now his mother took all the responsibility of Aamir's case, because there was no one else in the house
 ek bahan thi jo byaah kar pakistan ja chuki thi
 But Aamir's bad luck does not end here
 shuhar kii maut or bete ke maathe par aatankwaadi kaa kalank, in donon gamon ne aamir kii maa ko bhi buree tarah tod kar rakh diya
 Shockingly, the same year that the year Shauhar died, Aamir's mother was also paralyzed
 jism ke zyaadaatar hisse ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 Now there was a dead corpse in the house and legal games outside the house
 pairvi karne vaala bhi koi nahin tha, khayr vakt dhire-dhire bitta gaya
 Till now, Aamir had started trial in connection with the blasts in three states simultaneously
 ye mukadmaa dilli, gajiabad, rohtak or sonipat ke seshan court main chal rahe the
 Aamir had 22 cases registered against him in connection with the blasts
 inamen baaki tamaam dhaaraon ke saath-saath deshadroh or desh ke khilaaf jang kaa maamla bhi shaamil tha
 The trial of the cases was going on at its own pace
 din-maheene saal bitate ja rahe the
 Meanwhile, Aamir started studying in jail, but it was alleged that he was not allowed to remain in jail even in jail
 taane maare gaye ki aatankwaadi bhi ab padhai karegaa
 On the other hand, in four cities ie Delhi, Ghaziabad, Rohtak and Sonepat, the trial proceedings were going on among all the witnesses and evidence
 shahar beshak alag-alag the, par ye dilli, upi yaa haryana police kaa joint oparation nahin tha
 All the allegations from Aamir's arrest were made by the Special Cell of Delhi Police
 in chaar shaharon or 22 dhamaakon ke silsile main police ne kareeb 400 gavaahon kii lambii-chaudee fouj khadi kii thi
 Then also came the time when courts started to pronounce their verdict one by one
 sonipat, rohtak or gajiabad seshan court main ek bhi gavaah ne police kii kahani ko sahi nahin tehraaya
 So Aamir was acquitted from these three courts
 dilli ke dhamaakon kaa kalank ab bhi uske maathe tha
 Delhi Police's Special Cell showed Amir's arrest from Sadar Bazar railway station signal number ten
 lekin is giraftaar kaa koi saboot nahin tha
 While the law police should have informed about this arrest to the GRP or RPF i
e
 Railway Police Force and they should have made the witness of this arrest also
 iske alaava dilli main jitani jagah dhamaake hue the, vahaan bhi koi aisa gavaah nahin mila jisane aamir ko bam rakhte dekha ho
 The witnesses, who were told by the police to be witnesses of the blasts, also turned hostile in the court
 gavaahon ke alaava police ek bhi aisa saboot pesh nahin kar saki, jisase aamir kaa dhamaakon se rishta kaayam kiya ja saktaa
 Even the police could not prove his relationship with Abdul Karim Tunda or any terrorist organization
 lihaaja ek-ek kar aamir dhamaakon ke iljaamon se bari hota gaya or phir aakhirkaar 9 janvari 2012 ko lambey 14 saal baad use jail se rihaai mil gai
 Since Aamir's arrest and the case against Aamir were prepared by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, Aaj Tak made all efforts to talk to the top officers of Delhi Police about this
 lekin dilli police ne aamir ke bare main baat karne se saaf manaa kar diya
 Aamir is undoubtedly free now, he has returned home
