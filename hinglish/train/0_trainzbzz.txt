 The statement said that the Army and ISI chief were included as defendants in the petition filed in the apex court in connection with the alleged memo and the court gave direct notice to the defendants

 These words are ours, but speak or say, say and do, you will find signs of Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's activities
 nae saal main bhale maanjhi is baat ko sweekaar nahin karenge, lekin apane nirnyon se, apane kadamon se vah is baat kaa ahsaas sabko kara rahe hai ki mukhyamantri kii kursi par unhen bithaane vaale nitish kumaar ko by-by kar diya gaya he
 His policies, his favorite officers and his ambitious projects have taken him to whereabouts
 patna hoicourt kaa faisla party ke khilaaf aata he, lekin maanjhi us par apni party or sarkaar kaa bachaav karne ke bajaay us nirnay kaa swaagat hi nahin karte, balki bolte-bolte yah bhi bayaan de jate hai ki vidhansabha adhyaksh kaa nirnay galat tha
 The rest of the cancer was fired by Manjhi when he drove Chanchal Kumar, considered close to Nitish Kumar, in the transfer of officers
 sabko maaloom he ki chanchal bhale netaaon or adhikariyon main bahut lokapriy nahin hon, lekin nitish kumaar ke dil ke kareeb hai, chaahe patna main nae museum kii pariyojna ho yaa patna main canavension centre, sab par chanchal apane puraane bos ke anusaar kaam karvaa rahe the
 His departure means that Manjhi will not only hang these projects on one pretext or the other, but it is no surprise if some investigation is also started soon to surround Nitish
 bihar main maanjhi ke kareebi or satta ke khel ko samajhane vaale sab log jaanate hai ki aane vaale dinon main maanjhi ke nishane par honge bihar main bijli vibhaag ke pratyay amrit
 If Manjhi is successful in removing them, then understand that Nitish Kumar's announcement of providing electricity to every village in Bihar will also remain in the balance, but even the staunch supporters of Nitish Kumar believe that if this happens, Manjhi will not do anything wrong, rather he will According to the script of his future politics, Nitish is pushing Kumar to the margins
 isamen galati kiski he, nitish kumaar kii he, jinhone maanjhi ko kursi dene kii morrkhtaa kii, lekin khamiyaja maatr nitish kumaar hi nahin uthaaenge balki jo lalu yadav maanjhi ke upar apana varadahast die hue hai, unhen bhi maanjhi ke saath is najdiki kaa mulya chukaana hoga
 No one knows what that will be, but if Lalu continues his silent consent to these steps of Manjhi, then Nitish's faith will definitely be less or less on him and at the same time the plan of the Grand Alliance will also be defeated

 ’shivpal ne ek sawaal par kaha tha ki party kaaryakartaaon ko samaajwaad kaa itihaas padhanaa chaiye
 It is very important to have discipline in the party
 aapane 24 aktubar ko dekha ki jin logon ko baithak main nahin bulaayaa gaya tha, ve bhi usamen chale aae
 Sajan, who is in charge of the first phase of the Rath Yatra, said that during the Rath Yatra every two kilometers the Chief Minister would be welcomed and he would also address the public at various places

 " film kaa naam:mantodiarector:nandita dasstar cast:navazuddin siddiki,rasika duggal, taahir raaj bhasin, rishi kapur, divya datta, ranvir shouri, niraj kabi, javed akhtalvadhi:1 ghanta 56 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3
 The selection of 5 star actress and director Nandita Das's films has always been very different
 unhone film firaaq ke saath diarection kii duniya main kadam rakhaa tha
 This time Nandita has tried to make a film on the life of Urdu poet and famous personality Saadat Hasan Manto and with good research, Nandita has tried to show four years of her life, with Nawazuddin Siddiqui appearing in the lead role Let's know how this film is made - Kahani: - The story of the film starts in Bombay (now Mumbai) of 1946 where Urdu poet and writer Saadat Hasan Manto (nawazudd Ain Siddiqui) lives with his wife Safia (rasika Duggal) and daughter Nidhi, Manto's thoughts are always the most connected, due to which he is sometimes cross-examined by the producer of the film (rishi Kapoor) and sometimes by the film industry
 Spontaneous interaction with friends
 itnaa hi nahin riter group ke doston jaise ismat chugtai (rajshri deshpandey) se bhi inkaa andaaj juda rahata he, ismat or manto ke upar lekhan ke madhyam se lahore main ashleelata failaane kaa cese chal rahaa hota he, usee dauraan bharat or pakistan kaa bantwaaraa ho jaataa he, jisaki vajah se bombai ko beintehaa pyaar karne vaale manto ko apane dost or superstar shyaam (taahir raaj bhasin) se bichad karke pakistan janaa padataa he
 In Pakistan, Manto has to face the case for his chilled meat story and eventually there are some twists in the story that you will have to watch to know
 film ko kyon dekh sakate hai?film kii kahani or use darshane kaa dhang behad dilachasp he, 40 ke dashak ko nandita das ne us samay prayog main aane vaale upkarnon or veshbhusha ke saath saath choti-choti baton kaa bhi dhyaan rakhte hue dikhaaya he
 Nandita has depicted only four years of Manto's life in this almost 2-hour film, in which Manto's way of thinking and living can be seen very well
 jo log manto ke bare main jaanate hai, unhen yah film bahut acchhee lagegi, haalanki jinhen unke bare main nahin pataa he, unke liye bhi yah film ek sahi byopic ke rup main parosi gayi he, jahaan kuch bhi adhikta main nahin pesh kiya gaya he
 In terms of acting, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has played the character of Manto very well and after seeing him, it seems that Manto will have a mood
 vahin rasika duggal ne manto kii patni ke rup main bahut badhiya kaam kiya he, iske alaava taahir raaj bhasin ne sahaj abhinay kiya he
 The film also depicts Manto's stories through characters that feature actors such as Divya Dutta, Ranveer Shorey, Rishi Kapoor, Javed Akhtar, Neeraj Kabi
 film kaa becoground score badhiya he or jin logon ko saadat ali manto kii rachanaaen pasand he, yaa jo unki jindagi ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai, unhen ye film jarur dekhni chahie

 Along with this, if you are looking for a movie full of spicy, laughable fun and comedy five, then perhaps this film is not made for you

 sarkari telecom company BSNL ne shanivaar ko aadhikarik taur par ye ghoshnaa kii he ki company ke 399 rupee or isse upar ke anual broadband plance ke saath ab muft amejon prime sabsakripshan milegaa
 The free subscription of Amazon Prime will be given for one year, which is priced at Rs 999
 is ofer ko deshbhar main lagu kar diya gaya he, jahaan BSNL dwaara broadband sevaayen di jaati hai
 Earlier Amazon Service Providers used to offer free subscription of Amazon Prime with broadband plans above Rs 499
 haalanki ab company ne 399 rupee vaale kifayati plan ko bhi shaamil kiya he
 Apart from this, let us tell you that BSNL is also offering cashback offer on annual broadband plans to customers
 is ofer ke tahat graahakon ko 25 pratishat tak kii cashbek kaa laabh diya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that during AGM recently, Jio announced the commercial launch of its Geofiber
 aise main isaki ghoshnaa ke baad se hi baaki companiyaan harakat main aa gayi hai or apane plance ko jeeyo se mukaable ke liye pehle se behatar kar rahi hai
 In such a situation, BSNL giving free Amazon Prime subscription with annual broadband plans of Rs 399 and above can be seen as such a step
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den Amazon Prime sabsakripshan kii keemat ek saal ke liye 999 rupee hoti he
 It provides access to exclusive deals before Prime Video, Prime Music, free product shipping and others
 bataa den ki agar graahak keval ek maheene ke liye amejon prime kaa sabsakripshan chaahate hai to ve 129 rupee vaale plan kharid sakate hai
 UIDAI has made strong arguments in the Supreme Court regarding the security of citizens' data during the Aadhaar case hearing
 UIDAI ne kaha ki aadhaar kanoon sakasham or majboot he
 At the same time, it appealed to the court that in this case, the court should adopt a doctor-like attitude, that is, while treating the patient, it should give measures to strengthen the scheme rather than talk about scrapping the scheme
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan UIDAI kii taraf se kaha gaya ki niztaa kaa adhikaar apane aap me sampoorn nahin he
 It too has to be limited like the rest of the Fundamental Rights, that is, the ban can also apply
 itnaa hi nahin, niztaa ke adhikaar ko bhi anya duusare naagarik adhikaron ke saath talmail baithaana hoga
 How much information is being taken from the public for the purpose of the Aadhaar Act? All these facts have to be judged judicially
 aadhaar kanoon main UIDAI ko yah jaanane kaa haq nahin he ki kis vishesh kaaran se aadhaar ke number kaa othentification hua he
 We cannot share core biometric information
 airtel or exis bank ko jaankaree saajha karne ko lekar ham unako dandit bhi kar chuke hai
 Citing the IT Act, UIDAI said that if a person leaks data, then there is a provision for compensation for the person whose information is leaked
 adaalat aadhaar maamle ko ek doctor kii tarah treet kare, jo apane marijon ko thik karne par dhyaan detaa he ki kaise marijon ko thik karnaa he? marij ko kaise bachaaya jaae
 The court should tell what more reforms should be done in the Aadhaar Act, not it
 uidaine supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke samaksh kaha ki aadhaar kanoon bahut majboot he
 It provides appropriate and adequate protection against data breach
 peeth ke sadsy justise chandrachud ne maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan poocha ki aadhaar kanoon main suraksha kya he? kya data suraksha niyam ulanghan hone par koi aapraadhik karrwai yaa sajaa kii vyavastha kii gai he? dvivedi ne kaha ki ye galat he ki yuidiai 'meta data' main vyaktigat jaankaree ekatrit or sangrahit kar rahaa he
 He said that criminal cases are done under the Aadhaar law and punishment under the Information Technology Act
 unhone kaha ki nyaayamurti shrikrishna samiti ek kanoon par kaam kar rahi he, jo data kii suraksha sunishchit karegi or saath hi kisi vyakti kii niztaa ke adhikaron ko santulit karegi
 Meta-data has unique device code to ensure that the certification agency conforms to the prescribed standards
 boometric aankadon kaa koi sajhakaran sambhav hi nahin he, kyonki data panjikrut hone ke baad yah ancrypted hokar store main sangrahit kiya jaataa he
 He agreed that rapid technological advances are presenting challenges in data security
 lihaaja shrikrishna samiti iske liye ek majboot data sangrakshan kanoon sthapit karne ke liye vichaar kar rahi he
 He said that Aadhaar gives the poor and deprived sections of society a life to live and a nationally acceptable identity
 aadhaar unhen garv, garima or atmasamman detaa he
 At the same time it makes them realize that they are part of the society
 dvivedi ne kaha ki is kanoon kaa uddeshy logon ko sasti keemton par paryaapt bhojan sunishchit karana he, taaki log garima ke saath rah saken or jivan ji saken
 This ensures the integration of social and economic rights of marginalized sections of society

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday termed the situation at the Center as extremely fragile after the Trinamool Congress withdrew its support from the UPA government, saying that only those who would give special status to Bihar would be supported in forming the government
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ko lekar yojit kii jane vaali adhikaar raily ko lekar pashchim champaran jila mukhyalay betia ke maharaja stadium main yojit ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue nitish ne kaha ‘mamata banerjee ne samarthan waapas le liya he, sthiti bahut hi najuk he
 Nitish said, "congress people are adept at jugaad, the more the plight this government (UPA government at the center) is going to be in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ’bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ko lekar aagaamee chaar november ko yojit kii jane vaali adhikaar raily main puri takat lagaakar patna pahunchane kaa aahwan karte hue nitish ne kaha ki jo bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa ham usee ko sarkaar banane main madad karenge
 According to him, 'today, the UPA government at the center is not understanding your strength and those looking for a party with one or two mps will see forty mps from Bihar in the public rally, which will be seen in the rights rally and they will understand your strength
 ’mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki rajnatik jivan main unhone jitani bhi apni yatra or abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii he vah champaran se kii he or bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye bhi pashchimi champaran jila mukhyalay betia se adhikaar raily ko lekar apni yatra kii shuruyaat kii he, jo lagbhag ek maheene tak pradesh main vibhinn bhaagon main jari rahegi
 Nitish said that a rights conference has been organized at the block level to grant special state status to Bihar, and JDU workers were worried about its organizing in districts due to the ongoing rains in the state for the last three-four days
 This rain is a rain of relief as it will reduce the dry conditions in the state
 unhone kaha ki aaj nahin to kal dilli ko hamaari baat manani hogi or bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dena hoga

 kaha ja rahaa he ki camel or panje ke bich aghoshit gathbandhan karne waalon ko mishra ke kaaran kaarobaar main dikkat ai
 This is the reason that Mishra was first instructed not to speak to journalists despite being a spokesperson, when he did not agree, this leader of Indore was appointed as a spokesperson in Rewa division
 mana jaataa he ki mishra ne party ke bade netaaon ke saath bhaajapa sarkaar kii dariyaadilii ke kuch kisson ko ujagar kar diya
 As a result, he was removed from the post of Pradesh Congress spokesperson

 'it is believed that many leaders are against these guidelines
 magar koi bhi khulkar nahin bolnaa chahta
 Everyone is afraid that if he opens his mouth, he will be removed from office immediately
 ye nirdesh jari karne kii vajah yah he ki pravaktaaon ne bhaajapa sarkaar ke khilaaf aise maamle uthaa die jisaki vajah se congress ke kuch netaaon or sarkaar ke sameekaran bighad rahe the

 bharat ko pehla cricket vishwa cap dilaane vaale captain kapil dev ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki maujuuda captain viraat kohli purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ke chatur dimag kaa aane vaali champiens trophy main kis tarah istemaal karenge yah un par nirbhar karata he
 The Champions Trophy starts in England from June 1 and will run until June 18
 bharat is championships main maujuuda vijeta ke taur par utar rahaa he
 It was under Dhoni's captaincy in 2013 that India achieved this title
 is baar bharat kohli kii captaini main utrega
 Kapil believes that it is entirely up to Kohli how he uses Dhoni's experience
 kapil ne star sports dwaara yojit vaarta main ieenes se kaha, "yah kohli par nirbhar he ki vah purv captain ke anubhav kaa istemaal kis tarah karte hai
 i do not believe that Dhoni is the kind of person who will intervene constantly
 yah kohli par hoga kii vah dhoni kaa sarvshereshth istemaal kis tarah se karte hai
 " kapil ne dhoni ko sahi myne main harfanmaulaa khilaadi bataaya
 He said that performing only with bat and ball is not the identity of the all-rounder, but also includes wicketkeeping and batting
 unhone kaha, "dhoni ko mat bhuuliye, vah sahi myanon main harfanmaulaa khilaadi hai
 The ability of an all-rounder is not only with the bat and the ball, but also with wicketkeeping and batting
 "vishwa vijeta captain ne kaha, "vah number paanch or chah par behad ahm khilaadi hai"
 Kapil described Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja as all-rounders and praised them both
 unhone kaha, "kisi kii tulana karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Ashwin and Jadeja have done a lot better than the players of our time
 hamen unki kshamtaaon main vishwaas rakhana hoga kyonki unhone khud ko sabit kiya he or behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 " bharat champiens trophy kii shuruyaat chaar june ko chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf karegaa
 When Kapil was asked that this match would put pressure on India, he said, "I don't believe there will be pressure on India
 agar main pakistan ke khilaaf ballebaaji kar rahaa hum to yah myne nahin rakhata ki hamaara trek ricard kya he
 "he said," i will play the ball according to his merit
 yah media ke liye baat karne ke liye sahi he, lekin jab khilaadi maidan par jaataa he to vah is tarah se nahin sochataa
 He just wants to win
 " England's circumstances are in favor of the fast bowlers
 kapil kaa kahana he ki gendbaajon ko gend ko swing karaane par zyada dhyaan dena hoga or zyada vividhtaon se bachanaa hoga
 He said, "bowlers will have to bowl at their line length which will be very important
 england main aapako zyada kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he sirf gend ko swing karaane par dhyaan dena chahie
 It doesn't matter what the batsman is like
 If you can swing the ball, then you will dominate it

 He went to Indore to collect money by dealing with this unknown person
 vahaan jab unheen kii gaadi main revolver kii nok par unka apharan kar liya gaya tab unhen ehsaas hua ki jameen kii keemat main aayaa yah oochaal musiibat kaa sabab bhi he
 Rajesh was released after three days without any ransom due to the readiness of the police, but the fear of this incident is clearly visible in the traders

 on 17 August at the city's Hotel Ranjit
 es
 a person named Solanki came and stopped
 usne khud ko hivej athurity of india kaa manager bataaya or jameen kharidne kii babat sthaneey brokar rajesh paarikh or shyaam soni ke jariye rajesh se mila
 He bought a deal for about 7 acres of Rajesh's land for Rs 28 lakh
 prati acre kii dar se tay kiya
 But Raju Srivastava, who came with Solanki as the company's valuer, told Rajesh that the company owed him Rs 42 lakh
 kii dar se check se bhugtan karegi or is antar kaa paisa unhen nagad main lautaanaa hoga
 These people told Rajesh that the final deal will be stopped by his senior officers in Indore
 isliye unhen vahaan aana hoga
 Says Rajesh, "normally the deals here are like this, so i didn't see anything wrong
 ''24 agast ko rajesh donon sthaneey brokaron or apane saathi santosh jain ke saath indore ke radison hotel pahunche
 There Solanki and Srivastava separated and kidnapped Rajesh on the pretext of making payment and Rs 5 crore from his family

 police ne 28 agast ko haryana ke firozabad main ek makaan par chapa markar rajesh ko baraamad kiya
 Police have arrested the main accused Sudhir Bhadauria, Omkar Singh, Pradeep Chauhan and Mohammad Inam
 inke paas se eke-47, 6 pistal, 5 hand grenade or badi sankhya main gola-barood baraamad hua he
 Now the question is arising as to why Khandwa came under target
 praparty kaarobaar se jude sunil kaala bataate hai, ''khandwa main ek dashak se indira sagar baandh or omkareshwar baandh banane ke baad hi jameen kii keemat main jabardast teji ai he
 On one hand, these dams saved 249 villages from submitting to 2,28,370 acres of submergence, while the large acreage irrigated led to a significant jump in the price of land
 '' aisa hi hoshangabad jile main tawa baandh banane ke baad hua tha
 The land in the inner areas of the district is worth Rs 30-35,000
 acre bhi nahin bikati thi, uski keemat 10 se 15 guna bad gai he
 This is the reason that large investors of Indore have bought land here on a large scale
 ek thermal power stesan shuru hone or duusare stesan kii taiyaari ke bich is jile ko bhavishya ke power hub ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 At the same time, a big role has also been played by the local brokers who have shown the dreams of development to the investors more than the government
 jameen main do number kaa puraa paisa khap jaataa he, isliye bhi kaarobaari isamen zyada ruchi lete hai
 In the interrogation of the police, the kidnappers also said that the number of money used in the business of land, so there is not much difficulty in loosening the pockets of the people
 ratorat karodpati banane kii chaah main bhi kaarobaari aasaan shikaar ban rahe hai

 There have been reports for many days that Aamir Khan was approached to play the role of Sunil Dutt in the film
 lekin aamir ne ye role thukraa diya
 Aamir Khan himself has now revealed the reason behind this
 media se baatcheet main aamir khan ne kaha, ''rajkumaar hiraani kii film 'sanju' main mujhe sunil dutt ko role ofer kiya gaya tha
 But i refused to do it because i wanted to play the lead role
 ''jab dange main aamir khan ne mahatma gandhi ke stachu ke neeche guzari raatector ne kaha, ''rajkumaar hiraani mere paas script lekar aae the or mujhe wo pasand ai thi
 He wanted me to play the role of Sunil Dutt Saheb and it was a great role
 yah baap-bete kii kahani he, lekin sanju kii bhoomika jabardast he
 As an artiste i told Raju, Sanjay Dutt's role is great and it has won my heart
 isliye film main main sanjay dutt ke alaava koi or bhoomika nahin nibhaa saktaa, jo main kar nahin saktaa tha kyonki ranbir kapur use kar rahe hai
 "SANJU: ranbir is copying Sanjay very accurately, these 12 photos are Aamir Khan confident in Ranbir Kapoor playing the lead role in the film 'sanju'
 unka maananaa he ki ranbir ek behtareen kalakaar hai or unhen bharosa he ki unhone film main shandaar abhinay kiya hoga

 police ne ricep taip erdogan kii sarkaar ko girane se bachaa liya
 But this situation did not suddenly happen in Turkey
 san 1960 se lekar ab takturki main teen baar takhtapalatakia ja chukaa he
 Let's say five big reasons for this
 1
 Democracy: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'AK Party' (abortion of Turkish Initials of Justice and Development Party) came to power in 2002
 isse ek saal pehle hi eke party banaai gai thi
 Since then, Recep Erdogan has been accused of wanting to center all power around the president
 unhone kathith taur par lagaataar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke khilaaf kaam kiya
 2
 turki sarkaar kaa dharmik jhukawaricep taip erdogan ke satta main aane ke baad se hi sarkaar kaa rukh islam kii taraf jhuk rahaa he
 Many laws were also passed to implement Islamic rules in place of secular laws in the country
 3
 Turkey and the US military have close ties with the US, but Turkey's President Erdogan has poor relations with Western leaders
 erdogan or america raashtrapati baraak obama ke bich bhi kai baar tanaav kii sthiti paidaa ho chuki he
 4
 turki sena or erdogan ke tanaav bhare rishtesaal 2002 main satta main aate hirashtrapati erdogane kai sainya adhikariyon par kanoonee karrwai kii or kai par adaalaton main cese bhi chalaa
 Since then, the military and Erdogan's relationship has been bitter
 5
 The pressure to change the constitution: Erdogan has been in favor of the re-creation of the constitution since he came to power
 erdogan samvidhan main badlaav kar raashtrapati pad ko america rang main dhaalnaa chaahate the
 But his desire drove many of his supporters away from him
 singer abhijit kaa acount haal hi main twitor ne suspend kar diya
 After this, he again came on Twitter, but Twitter again suspended his account
 abhijit ne pichley kuch dinon main lagaataar mahilaon ke liye abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya tha, jiske baad twitor ne unka acount block kiya
 Twitter spokesperson aajtak on the matter
 in ko bataaya he, ‘twitor niyamon ke maamalon main saaf haior ise sakhti se lagu kiya jaataa he
 We want people to feel safe sharing their different opinions and beliefs here
 lekin jab baat abhadra bhashaa, maansik utpeedan yaa kisi duusare kii aawaaj ko dabaane kii koshish kii hoti he, to hamane ise kaaphi alag rakhaa he
 According to a Twitter spokesperson, if users violate these policies, then their account can be temporarily blocked or suspended forever
 ham logon ko is baat ke liye prerit karte hai ki wo twitor par kisi yujar dwaara kiye gaye abhadra vyavhar ko report karen
 After creating a new Twitter account, Abhijeet clearly says that many people are misleading his fans by creating fake accounts in his name and hence he was forced to come back to Twitter
 haalanki abhijit bhattacharya ke duusare acount suspend hone kesavaal par twitor ne kaha he, ‘company kisi vyakti vishesh ke twitor acount ko lekar tippanee nahin karti’ 
 So it is unclear whether Abhijeet's Twitter account has been closed forever or not

 aise main team india ke liye khushi kii baat he ki uske pramukh spinner ravichandran aswin kii chot thik ho gai he or wo test siries main khilne ke liye puri tarah se feet bataae ja rahe hai
 India will also have an opportunity to improve their ranking by winning in this series

 In such a situation, a lot of changes can be seen in the ICC Test rankings in the coming days

 If Pakistan wins this match, they will overtake Australia to reach second place, but if England win the third Test and draw a three-match series 1-1, then both teams will maintain their rankings
 australia or newjiland ke bich hone vaali siries ke baad jab isisi test ranking jari kii jaaegi to australia ko duusare sthaan par bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 1-0 se yah siries jeetni hogi
 After that the Test rankings will be released at the conclusion of the Test series between India and South Africa

 purv rail mantri lalu prasad ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya rail kii ati durgati ho rahi he jisamen ek taraf yatriyon ke tikat aarakshan main baari ‘jaalsaji’ faili hui he to duusari ore maal dhulaai ke liye dedicated fret karidor banane main deree se yah laabh nahin kama paa rahi he

 But due to not being a dedicated freight train corridor, goods trains reach their destination very late
 isse ve apane maal ko sadak parivahan ke jariye bhejne ko majaboor hai
 He said that due to this weakness of the railways, 80 percent of the goods in the country are transported by road transport
 lalu prasad ne kaha ki railway agar maal dhulaai ko behatar bana le to use baari munafa hoga jisase vah kaaphi samay se lambit apane vikaas or aadhunikeekaran ke kaaryakramon ko puraa kar sakegaa
 Describing 'public private partnership' as impractical to complete railway projects, he said that in this era of global recession, no one will come from Europe to invest in Indian Railways
 iske liye railway ko apni maal dhulaai vyavastha ko behatar bananaa hoga
 He said that everything should be left unheard of 'PPP'
 rail yatriyon ko tikat aarakshan milane main ho rahi baari dushavaari kaa ullekh karte hue unhone aarope lagaaya ki isaki mukhya vajah bade paimaane par ho rahi ‘jaalsaji’ he
 According to him, if the Railway Minister and high officials pay serious attention to this, then the problem can be solved in two minutes

 newjiland ke khilaaf barish se prabhavit pehle match main kuch visham paristhitiyon se guzarane ke baad australia isisi champions trophy ke kal yani somvaar ko ovel main bangladesh se bhidegi
 Australia will try to get their campaign back on track with a big win in a Group a league match
 australia or newjiland ke bich birmingham main khelaa gaya match barish ke kaaran puraa nahin ho paaya tha jisase donon tiimon ko ek ek ank se santosh karnaa padaa
 In response to New Zealand's 291 runs, Australia were in trouble by scoring 53 for three in nine overs till the rain was disrupted
 bangladesh kii shuruyaat bhi acchhee nahin rahi
 In the inaugural match against England, he lost by eight wickets despite scoring a huge total of 305 for six with Tamim Iqbal's century
 australia or bangladesh donon tiimon ke liye sthiti kamobesh karo yaa maro jaisi ban gai he kyonki ek match main haar se unki semifinal main pahunchane kii ummiido ko karaara jhatka lagegaa
 Smith is well aware of this fact
 unhone kaha, "match kaa barish kii bhent chadhana kisi bhi team ke liye adarsh sthiti nahin he
 Now we have to play each match like a final and win our next two matches
 is toornament main match radd hona yaa haar aap par baari pad sakati he
 " bangladesh ke khilaaf australia badi jeet darj karne kii koshish karegaa lekin smith kii team apane is pratidwandvi ko halke se lene kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakati kyonki use 2005 main cardiff main bangladesh ke haathon mili haar ab bhi kachotati he
 Both Australia and Bangladesh were disappointed by their bowlers in their opening matches
 tippaniyan Smith said after the match, "I think it was our worst bowling performance in a long time
 hamane wicket ke donon taraf gendbaaji kii
 We gave him a chance to play many easy shots
 yah behad saamaanya darje kii gendbaaji thi
 "james Pattinson can be taken into the team against Bangladesh who did not play in the previous match

 bangladesh ke captain mashrefi murtaja ne kaha he ki unke gendbaajon ko australia ke khilaaf adhik kasi hui gendbaaji kerani hogi
 He said, "we were unable to take wickets in the middle overs against England, which led to our loss
 hamaare ballebaajon ko bhi thodaa behatar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 We lost a lot of wickets in the last moments
 " australia ke sheersh kram ke ballebaaj david warner or aaron finch bhi pichley match ke kharaab pradarshan ko bhulaakar yahaan naye sire se shuruyaat karne ke liye utrenge
 Both of them are expected to start the team well
 madhyakram main captain smith, glen maxwell or trevis head bhi england ke khilaaf hone vaale team ke lig charan ke aakhri match se pehle aatmavishvaas bhari pari khelnaa chahenge
 Bangladesh also did not have a good start
 england ke khilaaf udghaatan match main tameem ikbaal ke shatak se chah wicket par 305 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa karne ke baavjood vah aath wicket se haar gaya
 For both Australia and Bangladesh teams, the situation has become more or less the same as a loss in a match would shock their hopes of reaching the semi-finals
 smith is tathy se acchhee tarah avgat hai
 He said, "it is not ideal for any team to climb the match of rain
 ab hamen prayek match final kii tarah khelnaa hoga or apane agle donon match jeetne honge
 In this tournament, the cancellation or loss of the match may be overshadowed by you
 " Australia will look to register a big win against Bangladesh but Smith's team cannot afford to take their opponent lightly as their defeat to Bangladesh in 2005 at Cardiff is still a disaster
 apane shuruuaati maichon main australia or bangladesh donon ko unke gendbaajon ne niraash kiya
 The comments smith ne match ke baad kaha tha, "mujhe lagata he ki yah pichley lambey arse main yah hamaara sabase bekaar gendbaaji pradarshan tha
 We bowled on either side of the wicket
 hamane unhen kai aasaan shaat khilne kaa mauka diya
 It was a very normal bowling
 " bangladesh ke khilaaf james patinson ko team main liya ja saktaa he jo pichley match main nahin khele the
 Bangladesh, however, will try to challenge their strong rival with opener Tamim Iqbal, captain Mushfiqur Rahim, all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman
 tameem or rahim ne pichley match main acchhee ballebaaj kii thi lekin shaakib donon morche par naakaam rahe the jabaki mustafijur bhi dhardaar gendbaaji nahin kar paye the
 Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has said that his bowlers will have to bowl more tightly against Australia
 unhone kaha, "england ke khilaaf bich ke overon main ham wicket nahin le paye jisase hamen nuksaan hua
 Our batsmen also have to perform a little better
 hamane aakhri kshanon main kaaphi wicket ganvaaye
 "australia's top-order batsmen David Warner and Aaron Finch will also go on to start afresh here, forgetting the poor performance of the previous match
 in donon se team ko acchhee shuruuaat kii ummid he
 In the middle order, captain Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head would also like to play a confident innings before the last match of the team's league stage against England

 The New York Times has reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Mod's silence on the Kathua scandal and the Unnao scandal
 mangalvaar ko america akhbaar neuyark times ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa ki bharat main is tarah kii or aisi hi anya hinsak ghatnaayen mahilaon, muslimon or daliton ko daraane ke liye 'rashtravaadi takaton dwaara ek sangathit or vyavasthit abhiyaan' kaa hissaa hai
 In an editorial titled 'modi's Long Silence as Women Are Attracted', the New York Times reminded how Modi constantly tweets and considers himself a talented speaker
 america akhbaar ne kaha ki iske baavjood piem modi apni aawaaj tab kho dete hai, jab mahilaon or alpsankhyakon ko lagaataar rashtravaadi or sampradayik takaton dwaara khatre kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Nationalist and communal forces are the basis of his Bharatiya Janata Party
 akhbaar ne shuukravaar ko modi dwaara is maamle par die gaye bayaan kaa bhi ullekh kiya, jisamen unhone kaha tha kidushkarmke ye maamle desh ke liye sharmidagi lekar aae hai or hamaari betiyon ko nishchit hi nyaay milegaa
 Modi's comment completely hollow: The New York Times said the New York Times said his statement was hollow, because it took too long, and instead of specifying it in a general way, expressed it by saying that the events discussed in the last two days Is happening akhbaar pradhanmantri modi par pehle bhi isi tarah kaa ravaiya apnaane kaa arope laga chukaa he
 Earlier, the New York Times accused Modi that a group of guards associated with his political campaign attacked and killed Muslims and Dalits by making false accusations of killing cows
 aaropee bijepi vidhayak ke bare main bhi kuch nahin bole modih akhbarajammu-kashmir kekathua main aath varshiya bacchee ke saath gangarapake baad hatya or uttar pradesh ke unnav main bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger dwaara kathith taur par ek ladki ke saath dushkarm maamle kaa puure desh main jabardast virodh ho rahaa he
 However, the Prime Minister has not said anything about the alleged BJP members involved in these crimes and other cases
 unhone uttar pradesh ke unnav cond ke aaropee bijepi vidhayak ke bare main bhi kuch nahin kaha
 The newspaper said that Modi's silence is not only shocking, but also disturbing
 america akhbaar ne dilaai nirbhaya cond kii yaksmerica akhbaar ne saal 2012 ke nirbhaya cond kii bhi yaad dilaai, jis par tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ne kadi pratikriya nahin di thi or use iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 The newspaper wrote that it seems that Modi did not learn from the 2012 Nirbhaya incident
 bijepi ne bade paimaane par chunaav main jeet darj kii thi, kyonki modi ne bhrashtachar se ghiri tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ke baad bharatiyon ko zyada javabdeh sarkaar dene kaa vaayada kiya tha, lekin iske sthaan par unhone chuppi or maamle se dhyaan hataane kii paddati viksit kii he, joki vishwa ke sabase bade loktantr ke swasthya kii chintaa karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ke liye kaaphi chintajanak he
 The newspaper said- Protect all sections, PM Modi in his editorial in the New York Times said that Modi cannot be expected to speak on every crime committed by those who support him, but this case of violence is a different- Excluded and not excluded
 ye rashtravaadi takaton ke sangathit or yojanabaddh abhiyaan kaa hissaa hai, jiskaa makasad mahilaon, musalamaanon, daliton or anya vanchit tabakon ko aatankit karnaa he
 The newspaper said that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to protect all the people and fight for them and not only for those who are politically attached to them
 shivasena ne kaha ki bharat kaa naagarik hone ke naate baba ramdev ko raajnneeti main shaamil hone kaa puraa adhikaar he
 However, the party said that it was not supportive of using fast as a political weapon
 party kii yah tippanee shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main ai he
 It is believed that this is a response to yesterday's remarks by Congress leaders that Baba Ramdev should be confined to Yoga
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘agar ek videshi, sonia gandhi congress netaaon kii ‘raajnneetik godmadar’ ban sakati hai, to ramdev, is desh kaa naagarik hone ke naate raajnneeti main shaamil kyon nahin ho sakate
 However, the newspaper has also said that corruption cannot end with hunger and 'ringing the conch'
 akhbaar likhata he, ‘iskaa samaadhaan bhrasht sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkna or uski bajaae saaf chhavi vaali, paardarshee or janata kii sarkaar ko laana he
 It also criticized the UPA government's argument that Ramdev was not allowed to go on a hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan
 akhbaar ne kaha he, ‘agar aisa tha, to samprag sarkaar ke varisht mantri baba ko anshan nahin karne ke liye manaane kyon gaye the
 The editorial also states that Ramdev himself is responsible for the entire incident as he did not have to start another fast just a few weeks after the successful fast of Anna Hazare
 sarkaar ko bahumat shriram kii krupa se mili-acharya dharmendrabhole- yah mudda supreme court main janaa hi nahin chahie thaegenda ajtak main ram mandir ke mudde par baat karte hue vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa, shri acharya dharmendra ne kaha ki ram janmabhumi nyaas ek pramanik or vishwasaneey nyaas he
 This trust has done the work of generating energy inside the country for the Ram temple
 isliye nyaas ke rahete kisi or ko trust main bhagidaar banane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 He further said, 'at first the issue should not have gone to the Supreme Court
 sarkaar ko bahumat hi shri ram kii krupa se mili thi
 The people sitting at the top of the government used to be the first to announce - this is a tableau, kashi-mathura is left
 isliye alag se trust kii jarurat hi nahin thi
 Referring to the Constitution, Acharya Dharmendra said that if this country has got a secular constitution, then it is made of Hindus
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya main banane vaala mandir bhavy hoga
 Which will become a center of wonder for tourists from all over the world
 vahiin supreme court dwaara sarkari trust banane ke aadesh par ipies or ayodhya rivigited kitaab ke lekhak kishor kunal ne kaha ki trust main ram janmabhumi kaa sabase bada adhikaar banataa he lekin isamen ek kanoonee aadchan he
 This authority can be given only to the trust formed after January 2019
 isliye kanuunan nyaas ko is trust main bhagidaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 But the people who are in this trust should form a trust
 ram kaa aacharan tyaag kaa he isliye jo bhi unase jude hai wo isi bhaavana ke saath kaam karen
 If there is a feeling of renunciation, then there will be no dispute about becoming a member
 bharat or ram kaa kissa is baat kaa udhaaharan he
 Both kept on powering each other
 puure vishwa itihaas main is tarah kaa udhaaharan dekhne ko nahin milegaa
 Taking a dig at Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, President of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Raj Thackeray said that the court has termed the movement of Raj Thackeray as terrorism
 maharashtra main uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf jari hinsa par amar singh ne kaha ki in sab ke liye rajya sarkaar jimmedaar he
 He said that there is no such thing as Sarkar in Maharashtra
 rajya sarkaar par piem ko faisla karnaa he
 It is true that we are not able to pressurize but are pleading
 unhone centre sarkaar par bharosa jataate hue kaha ki mujhe puri ummid he ki centre sarkaar batla house encounter kii nyaayik jaanch bhi karaayegi or maharashtra main uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf jari hinsa main bhi uchit kadam uthaaegi

 Due to this, people have a lot of difficulty in bringing everyday things

 This cold also proves fatal for those who spend their lives on the pavement and have no other option than to survive the cold fire
 mausam vibhaag ne baari barfbaari ke saath puure disambar maah main barfbaari kii ashanka jataai he
 According to the weather department, snowfall is likely to occur in the higher parts and in the higher parts more than 2000 meters
 isse saaf he ki maidaanon ko chhod adhiktar sabhi pahadiyon par barf dekhne ko mil sakati he
 There are signs of heavy snowfall in many areas including Uttarkashi, Almoda, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh
 isliye vahaan ke logon ko satark rahane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Like the Meteorological Department, the government has also been asked to be vigilant

 At the Congress Bachao rally, Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi roared, thundering the issues of women security, inflation, unemployment and farmers to the central government
 rahul gandhi ne apane tevar dikhaate hue maafee maangane se inkaar kiya
 Rahul Gandhi said that my name is Rahul Gandhi, not Savarkar Gandhi
 is par bijepi netagiriraajane palatwaar karte hue kaha kiudhaar kaa sarnem lene se koi gandhi nahin hota
 Giriraj Singh tweeted and said, Veer Savarkar was a true patriot
 udhaar kaa sarnem lene se koi gandhi nahin hota, koi deshbhakt nahin banataa
 To be patriotic, pure Hindustani blood is needed in the veins
 vesh badalakar bahut logon ne hindustan ko lutaa he ab yah nahin hoga
 Who are these three? Are these common citizens of all three countries? Veer Savarkar was a true patriot
 
 
 udhaar kaa sarnem lene se koi gandhi nahin hota ,koi deshbhakt nahin banataa

 com / ntbzjhcxdi— Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp)december 14, 2019asal main, congress party ke purv adhyaksharahul gandhi yahaan shanivaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii maafee kii maang par tanj kasate hue kaha ki unka naam rahul saavarkar nahin he, vah rahul gandhi hai or maafee nahin maangenge
 Rahul Gandhi was addressing the 'save India rally' organized by the party at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 unhone kaha, "kal sansad main bhaajapa ke netaa mujhase maafee kii maang kar rahe the
 But i want to tell them that my name is not Rahul Savarkar, i am Rahul Gandhi
 main maafee nahin maagunga
 "rahul's reference was to a letter of apology written by Hinduist leader late Vinayak Damodar Savarkar to the British government on November 14, 1913, which he wrote while in the Andaman Cellular Jail
 rahul gandhi ne aage kaha ki maafee bhaajapa ke log maangenge, pradhanmantri narendra modi maangenge or unke assistant grahamantri amit shah maangenge is desh se, jinhone desh ko is haalat main pahunchaaya he
 He said that the Congress leader, the worker will not apologize
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne jharkhand main ek chunavi raily ke dauraan 'rape in india' tippanee kii thi, jis par bhaajapa sadasyon ne shuukravaar ko sansad main unase maafee kii maang kii thi
 There was a lot of uproar in Parliament over Rahul's remarks
 dharmik bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchane ke aarope main goa ke ek hindu sanghathan ne haal hi main pradarshit bahucharchit film 'slamdog milionair' ke nirmaataaon ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko margo, panaji or mapusa ke police steshnon main shikaayat darj karwaai he
 The organization has alleged that the film allegedly portrayed the Hindu deity Rama in the wrong form
 sanghathan ne yah film ke pradarshan par pratibandh lagane kii maang kii he
 The organization has made filmmaker Christian Coulson, screenwriter Simon, director Danny Boyle, co-director Lavinen Tandon and Q&A author Vikas Swarup as the main accused
 rahul gandhi jald hi congress party ke adhyaksh banane banane ja rahe hai, lekin sattadhari dal ise lekar vipakshi congress par hamalavar hai
 Rahul's rival in Amethi, now Union Minister Smriti Irani, has taken a dig at him
 shanivaar ko smriti ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki pehle 'bechaare' ko party adhyaksh to banane do
 Irani brushed aside reports of Rahul becoming the country's leader
 mumbai main shanivaar ko ek kaarykram main sawaal-jawaab ke dauraan jab irani se poocha gaya ki kis netaa ke bare main sabase zyadabadha chadha kar batki jaati he
 Then, without naming Gandhi, he said, 'let the poor person be the president right now, first let him become the president of your party, i am not talking about the country right now'
 rahul is saptaah congress adhyaksh banane ja rahe hai
 Smriti Irani contested from Amethi, the traditional seat of Rahul Gandhi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, although she lost in this
 baavjood iske smriti lagaataar amethi kaa daura kar janata ke bich jaati rahati hai
 The Congress party lost the Amethi Municipality seat in the recent UP civic elections, while the BJP won from there
 tivi or film nirmaataa ekta kapur se jab yahi sawaal poocha gaya to unhone is par apni pratikriya dene se manaa kar diya
 When filmmaker Karan Johar was asked, "do you think there is a lot of nepotism in politics?" Both Karan and Irani agreed to this
 karan johar ne kaha, 'yah bilkul filmi lag rahaa he, bhagwaan ke liye mujhe chhod do'
 Please tell that Karan has been in controversies about the issue of nepotism at an award ceremony

 Those who could not run the government stated the opposite of the situation
 ''babu ne un par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ‘‘siddharmaiya kaa bayaan unka aacharan pratibimbit karata he
 If a leader loses control of his language, it shows his frustration
