 Turned 69 on 11 September
 maharashtra ke chandranagar main janme or pashu chikitsa kii padhai karne vaale mohan bhagwat ke daur main aresas ne santhnik safalataa ke nae aayam gadhe hai
 In the era of Bhagwat, who became the Sangh chief in 2009, today more than eight lakh volunteers visit more than 55 thousand branches in the country
 desh bhar main do lakh se zyada seva kaary (prakalp) chal rahe hai
 In the era of Bhagwat, the Sangh has registered considerable strength in the northeastern and southern states, which previously had negligible presence
 vaise, yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah 2014 ke chunaav main modi ke chehre ke peeche ekajute hokar sangh parivaar ke khadaa ho jane se jeet or aasaan hui
 Won more bumpers in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki sangh ise apni jeet nahin balki janata kii rashtriya aakankshaon kii jeet maanata he
 Talking to a Sangh pracharak, he expresses his direct objection and says why do you see us joining BJP
 mohan bhagwat ke janmdiwas ke maukey par baat karte hai unke or modi ke daur main sangh or bijepi ke rishte ke bare main
 Strong coordination during the bhagwat-modi era, the foundation of the Sangh organization in Gujarat today was once laid by Mohan Rao Bhagwat's father Madhukar Bhagwat
 vah gujarat ke pehle praanch prachaarak the
 He entered into household life by marrying later
 narendra modi apni yuvavastha main bhagwat kaa saannnidhya paa chuke hai
 Union thinker Dilip Deodhar Aajtak
 inse kehete hai ki rishte ko dekhen to modi ko madhukar raav bhagwat kaa 'maanas putr' bhi aap kah sakate hai
 It is a result of the summit between the BJP and the Bhagwat-led Sangh in the modi-shah era that there has been no conflict of any kind on personal and organizational issues since the successive majority government was formed in 2014 and 2019
 Did not come jab bhi sangh or bijepi ke bich aarthik, raajnneetik muddon par kuch asamanjas kaayam hua to koardination cameti ne mil baithkar maamla sulajhaa diya
 During the time of Bhagwat and Modi, there was no public sharp rhetoric of any kind, even the signs were not targeted
 nahin to atal bihari vaajapeyi or sudarshan ke daur main sangh ke padaadhikari saarvajanik bayaanbaji karne se bhi nahin chookte the
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch, farmers and trade unions associated with the Sangh then used to open a front against the Atal Government
 pushkar baithak main dikhaa samanvay kaa udhaahranhaal main 7 se 9 sitambar tak pushkar main chali samanvayak baithak main bhagwat-modi ke daur main sangh-bijepi ke rishte kii paripakvata kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 When on the issue of reservation that bothers BJP the most, the Sangh has clearly stated that till inequality is eliminated from the society, the reservation should continue
 sangh ke is bayaan se bijepi ne raahat kii saans lee
 This can be gauged by how much the Sangh cares for the BJP on the political issue
 dilip devdhar ise sangh or bijepi ke padaadhikariyon ke bich samanvay kii safalataa bataate hai
 Many similarities between bhagwat-modi, Union chief Mohan Bhagwat were born on 11 September and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 17 September
 maah hi nahin donon kii janmatithi varsh 1950 bhi samaan he
 When the Sangh has a centenary year in 2025, both Bhagwat and Modi will turn 75
 bhagwat or modi donon ke vyaktitv main samay ke saath samanvay banaakar chalane kaa gun he
 Sangh sources believe that Bhagwat and Modi are same
 aise main senior-junior jaisi bhi baat nahin he, kabhi isi vajah se atal or sudarshan ke daur main bijepi or sangh ke rishte asahaj rahete the
 Concern is also shared by both the Sangh and the BJP and Bhagwat and Modi by co-ordinating and working to maintain proper existence
 sangh vichaarak dilip devdhar kehete hai ki gandhi kii hatya ke baad nehru ne sangh par bain laga diya
 Indira imposed restrictions in the Emergency and even when the Ayodhya incident happened, the then Congress government was banned
 vahiin jab upie sarkaar rahi to ek taraf hindu aatankwaad turm gadhakar indresh kumaar sahit sangh ke anya netaaon par shikanja kasne kii taiyaari hui, duusari taraf gujarat main tab siem rahe modi or grih mantri rahe shah ko bhi kanoonee pachade main daalane kii koshish hui
 In such a situation, the common concern of Sangh, BJP and Modi was to maintain the existence firmly in future
 samajha gaya ki samanvay se kaam karne main hi tay lakshyon ko puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also necessary to have power to expand and fulfill the agenda
 yahi vajah rahi ki sangh or bijepi ne 2004 jaisi galati dohraane kaa sankalp nahin liya
 In Mohan Bhagwat's era, officials of the Sangh or allied organizations avoid personal criticism of BJP policies or leaders
 haa sanghathanon kii baithkon main nitigat aalochana jarur hoti he
 Vajpayee's relationship with Sudarshan remained uneasy
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in an article written in Organizer in 1995, described the Sangh as his soul
 unhone likhaa tha, "aresas ke saath lambey judaav kaa sidhaa kaaran he ki main sangh ko pasand karata hum
 i like his ideology and most of all, i like rss's attitude towards people and towards each other and this is found only in RSS
 "haalanki pradhanmantri banane ke baad ek daur aisa bhi aayaa, jab unke sangh se rishte kuch asahaj ho chale the
 This phase was the phase of KS Sudarshan who became the head of the Sangh Sangh
 us vakt sangh va sahyogi sanghathanon ke netaa vyaktigat hamale karne se bhi nahin chookte the
 While in the Sangh, there was a tradition of policy criticism, not personal
 vaajapeyi ke jamaane main swadeshi jaagran manch, vihip, bhartiya majdoor sangh, kisaan sangh jaise sangh ke anushangik sanghathanon se kai maukon par takaraav hota rahaa
 The relationship had also deteriorated after Govindacharya, who had come to BJP from the Sangh, for allegedly calling Vajpayee a mask
 yahaan tak ki 2005 main ek intervyuu main tatkaaleen sangh pramukh kees sudarshan ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko akarmanya tehra diya tha
 At the same time, he was also advised to take political retirement
 sangh kii vaajapeyi kii naaraazgi ke centre main govindacharya kaa mudda bhi rahaa
 When Atal Bihari Vajpayee had come out in displeasure and said that either he or i will stay in Bijpi
 aakhirkaar govindacharya ko adhyayan avkaash ke bahaane bijepi chhodani padi thi
 Dilip Deodhar, the Nagpur thinker of the atal-sudarshan differences, said in 2004 that the Sangh Parivar had come out to organize Hindu society in 2004 but had become unorganized
 vaajapeyi se takaraav kaa nateeja rahaa ki 2004 main sangh parivaar us tarah se chunaav main ekajute nahin hua, jaise purv ke chunaavon main rahata tha
 This was a result of lack of coordination between the Sangh and the BJP in the era of Sudarshan and Vajpayee
 bakaul devdhar," haalanki main to yah nahin kahuunga ki sangh parivaar ke ekajute na hone se haar hui, magar 2004 ke aam chunaav main iskaa fark jarur padaa
 The difference in seats between BJP and Congress was not much
 jo bhi siten bijepi va endie ko milin vah atal sarkaar ke achche kaaryon se mili
 Yes, if the Sangh Parivar had united, the results could have changed
 main to kahuunga ki yah congress kii jeet nahin balki sangh kii haar thi
 The case of junior-seniors was also behind the confrontation! Union ideologue Dilip Deodhar says that KS Sudarshan was very firm about his views
 yah atal bihari vaajapeyi jaanate the
 This is the reason that even though Rajju Bhaiya had declared him as the successor in 1998, he got the responsibility of Sir Sanghchalak in late 2000
 deree ke peeche sangh parivaar main yah charchaa rahati he ki us vakt atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki agar sudarshan abhi banate hai to sarkaar chalaane main pareshaani hogi
 In such a situation, even when the delay was met, Sudarshan became somewhat negative about Vajpayee
 darasal, sudarshan ko laga ki vaajapeyi bijepi main hokar bhi sangh kii kaarypaddati main hastkshep karnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time it is also believed that even though Sudarshan Sir became the Sanghchalak in the Sangh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee considered him as a junior
 aise main junior-senior hone kii vajah se bhi kuch muddon par takaraav hota rahaa
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee at that time had distanced himself from the work of coordination with the Sangh Parivar
 yah kaam adwani ke jimme rahata tha
 As a result, the relationship between Vajpayee and the then Sangh Sanchalak was not as sweet as it used to be

 Sagar, in a way, targeted the PDP mentor Mufti Mohammed Saeed, accusing him of being 'responsible for countless massacres and the creator of repression in the state'

 Raghbir also entered the Air Force following in his father's footsteps
 sabakuch thik chal rahaa tha ki 1979 main duty jwine karne jate vakt ek khatarnaak road accident main ek taang gavaan baithe
 Raghbir did 16 years of duty after the accident, but all the time he used to find one thing that he would never be able to drive a car
 man main har vakt yah vichaar sataata rahata tha ki vah dusron par boj na ban jaaen
 Gradually he started the practice of driving a car and from 1985 he started driving a car only
 haalanki vah thodi duuri kii yatra hi karte rahe
 After retiring from the Air Force, Raghbir started his business and established a substantial business in Noida, Delhi, Gurgaon and Ambala in Haryana

 The grandson inspired that Raghbir had to come to Pune from his ancestral village in Ambala some time ago
 unka pota vishwajit singh unhen bolta rahaa ki dada aap khud gaadi chalaate hue pune jaao
 The insistence of the grandson was that Raghbir took the key from the driver and drove his two friends to Pune, driving the car themselves
 raghbir singh ek taang se hi gaadi daudaate rahe
 The laughing face of his grandson who inspired him was in front of his eyes all the time

 In this 1740 km long journey between Ambala to Pune, Raghbir stopped the car only five times, that too just to wash his face and take some rest

 "do not leave those who have done this dirty work with me", Nirbhaya said this to DCP South Chhaya Sharma when Chhaya went to meet her at Safdarjung Hospital for the first time
 aaj yani shuukravaar ko jab sapreme court ne jab sabhi doshiyon ko maut kii sazaa sunai tab chaaya ne man hi man nirbhaya ko yaad kiya or uskaa dhanyavad kiya
 Thank you because she never turned back from her statement
 in dinon chaaya rashtriya maanavadhikaar kamishan main bataur diaiji tainaat hai
 Chhaya said while speaking to NDTV India
 "dilli police ne jo saboot pesh kiye he wo ekadam thos he," sapreme court ke teen jajon ne faisalaa dete hue kaha
 "all these accused have been punished only because of Nirbhaya
 wo apane bayaan par nirantar qaayam rahi " She still remembers the day when she first met 23-year-old Nirbhaya
 "uski haalat bahut karaab thi
 He was not being spoken to but he did not lose courage, "
 sapreme court ne bhi faisalaa dete hue mana ki jo kuch nirbhaya ke saath hua wo bahut bhayanak tha
 "it is often seen that rape victims get nervous
 sach nahin bataate yaa puraa sach yaad nahin kar pate lekin is ladki kaa ravaiya bada positive tha," chaaya aaj bhi uske hausale kii daad detii he
 Nirbhaya first made his statement to the hospital doctor, then to SDM and then to the judge
 teenon baar wo apane bayaan par qaayam rahi
 He spoke such small things in his statement which ultimately proved to be very important for the police
 nirbhaya kii maut ke pehle ke in bayanon ko dying diclaration mana gaya
 Nirbhaya died in Singapore 13 days after the accident
 chaaya ke mutabiq jab ye maamla darj hua tha tab police ke aage sabase badi chunauti aropiyon tak pahunchnaa thi
 Often in rape cases, the accused knows the victim but this was not the case
 "hamaara kaam isliye bahut mushkil tha ki hamen shuruyaat se maamle main tafteesh kerani padi," 1999 batch kii ipies afasar kaa kahana he ki jaanch main sabase pehla ahm suraag police ko tab mila jab pataa chalaa ki jis bas main rape hua uski seat laal rang kii thi or parade pile

 But he did not give up
 baar-baar footage dekhne se saamne aayaa ki bas par yadav likhaa hua tha

 " According to Chhaya, when this case was registered, the biggest challenge before the police was to reach the accused
 aksar balaatkaar ke maamalon main aaropee peedit ko jaanata he lekin is maamle main aisa nahin tha
 "our job was so difficult that we had to investigate the matter from the beginning," says the 1999 batch IPS officer, that the first important clue in the investigation was found by the police when it was found that the bus in which the rape took place was red
 And the screen was yellow
 tippaniyan "now it was not easy to find such a bus
 hamane 300 bas kii list banaai or hamaari team sabaki pahchaan karne lagi,"
 There were close to 100 policemen in Chhaya's team
 sabakaa kaam baant diya gaya
 “my team was very hardworking
 aapas main baithkar faisale leti thi
 We all came to the conclusion that the brutality with which the accused and the fearlessness with which they committed the crime proves that they were well aware of the area
 " Chhaya said, the police did not help much on the CCTV footage
 lekin himmat nahin chodi
 Repeatedly watching the footage revealed that the bus had Yadav written on it
 isse police kii search kaa dayera or kam ho gaya
 "thinking the driver or cleaner should have been in that area, we proceeded with the investigation
 phir kya tha ek-ek sabhi aaropee giraftaar hote chale gaye
 " aparaadh hone ke 18 ghanto ke andar pehle aaropee bas driver ramsingh ko giraftaar kiya
 "all the accused were arrested after interrogation"
 aaj jab sapreme court ne police kii jaanch par muhar lagate hue aropiyon ko sazaa sunai tab jo police vaale is tafteesh se jude the unke chehron se pareshaani kuch samay ke liye gaayab ho gai
 Everyone started to worry about the investigation done
 "hamane is maamlemen aarope patr sirf 18 din main court main pesh kiya tha
 The charge sheet was so sure that three courts upheld it
 agar usamen koi kaami hoti to sapreme court aaj hamen hi taang detii

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it clear that it cannot instruct doctors to circumcise the minor girls of Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community
 nyaayalay ne is prakriya ke peeche ke ‘vaigyanik tark’ par bhi sawaal uthaae
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, hearing a petition challenging circumcision, questioned the procedure and said that there is hardly any logic behind it, as the girl is forced to be circumcised for non-medical reasons

 Their faith may be in danger but they will have to adopt the procedure under the Constitution itself

 The Central Government said in the court that circumcision should be abolished like Sati and Devadasi
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community was told that they will try to get the help of a doctor to complete this process
 ham chaahate hai ki adaalat is baat ko record par le ki bhavishya main ham ise prashikshit doctor se hi karaayenge
 It should be treated as a practice like waxing or shaving
 daudi bohara muslim sanghathanon ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, 'prakriya utani krur nahin he, jaisaa yachikakarta bataa rahe hai
 The practice has been in practice for centuries
 ye bohara samudaay kaa anivaary dharmik niyam he

 apni shaadi ko khaas banane ke liye log kya kuch nahin karte
 If someone makes a splash in the air, then they are tied in seven rounds in a moving train
 sabhi kaa makasad apni shaadi ko yaadgaar bananaa hota he, lekin jaruri nahin ki har baar jaisaa sochaa jaae vaisaa hi ho
 The same thing happened with an American couple
 darasal, yah joda shaadi ke venue main apane entrens ko yaadgaar bananaa chahta tha
 dulha-dulhan was also successful in this, but exactly what he thought happened
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah joda america kaa rahane vaala he
 The couple had decided that they would enter their wedding venue in a very different way
 shaadi kaa venue bhi bada shandaar tha
 Surrounding the lake was a meadow, where the bridegroom had to descend while hanging in the air
 iske liye unhone ek taar bandhvaya tha
 Everything was going well, but then messed up
 hua yun ki dulhan haathon main guladasta liye taar se latakati hui ghaas ke maidan par pahunchi hi thi ki tabhi peeche se duulhaa latakta hua aayaa or usase ja takaraayaa
 After this, the bride hung in the air like a pendulum of a clock, while the bridegroom fell to the ground
 yah video 2011 main shoot kiya gaya tha, lekin abhi pichley hafte hi ise intnet par daalaa gaya he
 Although it is not known where the bride and groom reside and where was the wedding scene, but this video is being seen extensively on the internet: congress mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya ne pashchimi uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke congress ke pradarshan kii samiksha kii
 In this regard, he held a Congress meeting in Lucknow
 baithak ke baad sindhiya ne kaha ki jamini str par sanghathan ko majboot karne ke liye tamaam pratikriyaayein milin
 At the same time, Scindia has also given a statement about forwarding Congress National Secretary General Priyanka Gandhi for the post of UP CM
 kareeb saadhe 6 ghante tak chali jyotiraditya sindhiya ne lakhanu main samiksha baithak ke baad kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nattejey asantusht karne vaali thim
 Scindia said that they will also discuss the names of the candidates for the by-elections and will contest on their own
 vahiin teen saal baad hone vaale chunaav ko lekar bhi unhone kaha ki wo ise akele ladenge
 On the other hand, on declaring Congress National General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi as the Chief Minister face, she said that the party will consider it
 hamaara uddeshy sanghathan ko majboot karnaa he
 Please tell that during the Lok Sabha elections Jyotiraditya Scindia was given the charge of western Uttar Pradesh
 pashchimi upi main congress kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa or party koi seat nahin jeet pai
 The special thing is that Congress could win only Rae Bareli seat
 khud party chif rahul gandhi bhi amethi loksabhaa seat bijepi pratyaashee smriti irani ke haathon haar gaye
 At the review meeting, the Congress leaders said that after the formation of SP-BSP alliance, the people stopped looking at the Congress as an alternative
 congress ummidavaar janata ko yah bharosa dilaane main naakaamayaab rahe ki ve jeetne ke liye maidan main hai
 Priyanka Gandhi's statement was done right, in which she said that we are a vote cut
 isse kaaryakartaaon or pratyaashiyon kaa manobal or gir gaya

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, there has been a halt to the alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress for quite some time
 kaaphi siyaasi uthaa-patake ke baad aakhirkaarloksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) ko lekar dilli main aam aadmi party (aam Aadmi Party) or congress (congress) ke bich gathbandhan ho gaya
 If sources are to be believed, both parties will field their candidates in three out of seven seats in the Lok Sabha in Delhi
 vahiin ek seat shatrughna sinha yaa yashavanth sinhako di jaaegi
 That is, neither the Congress is big or the common man party in Delhi
 donon partiyaan baraabar-baraabar siton par hi chunaav ladegi
 It is believed that either Shatrughan Sinha or Yashwant Sinha will be a common candidate from both the parties
 haalanki, shatrughna sinha ke naam par faisla rajd ke us stand ke baad aayega, ki agar rajd patna sahib se shatrughna sinha ko ummidavaar banaaegi
 Explain that before this, the Aam Aadmi Party had announced the names of its candidates in 6 seats
 darasal, is bich congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko congress kii dilli unit ke netaaon ke saath gathbandhan par charchaa ke liye baithak kii bulaai he
 a meeting was to be held at his house from 12 noon
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak ke baad hi gathbandhan par aadhikarik ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 According to sources, the central leadership of the Congress was ready for an alliance, but the party's Delhi unit was not in its favor
 yahi vajah he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bich main aana padaa
 Earlier it was reported that the Aam Aadmi Party has suggested two formulas for alliance to the Congress
 ab arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party siton kaa sauda karne ke mud main he
 This is the reason that under the first formula of the Aam Aadmi Party, the AAP wants the Aam Aadmi Party to contest in 6 seats in Delhi and the Congress on just one
 is surat main aam aadmi party phir kahin chunaav nahin ladegi, jahaan congress hogi
 At the same time, under the second formula, the Aam Aadmi Party says that if the Congress wants more seats in Delhi, then it will have to compensate by giving seats in states like Punjab, Haryana
 sutron ke is daawey kii pushti is baat se bhi hoti he kyonki aam aadmi party ne dilli kii 7 loksabhaa siton main se ab tak 6 par hi apane ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan kiya he
 He has not yet opened his leaf on one seat
 mana ja ja rahaa he ki aam aadmi party ab bhi yah maanati he ki agar congress se saath gathbandhan ho jaae to uske liye yahi saatvaan seat chhod diya jaae
 Here, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has called a meeting on Tuesday about the alliance of Congress with Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 is baithak main congress ke kai netaa shaamil honge
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi is likely to take a decision on an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party after a meeting today
 sutron ke mutabik congress alaakaman dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan chahta he jabaki congress kii rajya ikai gathbandhan ke paksh main nahin he
 Last week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announced its candidates for 6 seats in Delhi
 aap netaa or dilli ke sanyojak gopal raay ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye aam aadmi party ne abhi tak loksabhaa kii 6 siton ke liye apane pratyaashiyon ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii thi, jiske anusaar unke ummidavaar hai: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi appeared in a Bhiwandi court on Monday in a defamation case filed against his alleged remarks against the RSS in the context of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination
 is masale par ab agali sunwaayee 3 march ko hogi
 'gandhi ji fight against the killers' Rahul Gandhi, who arrived for hearing, said outside the court that i miss Gandhiji today
 meri ladaai us vichaardhaara ke khilaaf he, jisane gandhi kii hatya kii, jinhone gandhiji ko calendar se hataa diya
 Gandhiji will always be in the heart of India
 wo gandhiji ko maar sakate hai, lekin unhen mitaa nahin sakate
 During the last hearing, the magistrate's court in Bhiwandi granted bail to Rahul
 us samay bhi rahul gandhi adaalat main pesh hue the
 The court adjourned the case till 30 January
 gauratlab he ki aresas ke sthaneey padaadhikari rajesh kunte nerahul gandhi ke bayaanko lekar manahani kaa maamla darj karaayaa he
 This speech of Rahul is from 6 March 2014
 is bhaashan ke dauraan rahul ne kathith taur par daawa kiya tha kiaresaiske logon ne gandhi kii hatya kii
 After the Supreme Court refused to stay the case, Rahul Gandhi appeared before the court
 isse pehle kii peshi main rahul gandhi ne adaalat se kaha tha ki gandhi ji kii hatya 30 janvari 1948 ko hui thi or isi kaaran 30 janvari kii peshi main ve adaalat main maujuud rahenge
 a local RSS worker in Bhiwandi has filed a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa ajam khan ne aaj lokmanch ke adhyaksh amar singh ke un prayaason par aashcharya jataayaa jiske tahat vah kuch filmi sitaron or corporate labiist nira radia ke saath apni baatcheet ke tepon kii saamagree kaa khulaasa karne se media ko rokane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Khan said, 'there will be some very objectionable things in the tapes otherwise Singh would not have obtained a stay order from the Supreme Court on publication of this conversation
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas un baatcheet kii sidi he or agar nyaayalay ne anumati di to ham sabit kar sakate hai ki charitraheen log raajnneeti main ghus aae hai

 The land on which the 30-storey building is planned for construction was originally owned by the Ministry of Defense, Government of India and was acquired for public purpose by the state government
 forum ke adhyaksh dow
 KP Singh Yadav has written in the letter that where it is planned to build a 39-storey building, the nearest metro station is, DMRC gave this land for development work after the metro construction but DMRC has leased it permanently to a private builders Two-thirds of this land was sold and it is to be constructed soon by replacing the residential land with public and semi-public facility
 forum ne is 39 manjila imaarat kaa purajor virodh kiya he kyonki dilli vishvavidhyalay kii desh videsh main ek pahchaan he
 By constructing a 39-storey building in this way, a foreign culture will be flourished here which will be dangerous by changing the important form of social, cultural landscape
 jab vishvavidhyalay campus main is tarah kaa awasaiya pariyojna banegi to campus main mahilaon, chaatraon kii suraksha khatre main hogi
 There are many hostels near this campus, colleges have their own Teaching Flats where families and women are staying
 lekin iske banane se parisar main sabhi chaatraon ke liye gambhir suraksha muddon ko janm degaa
 Dr
 capi singh yadav ne patr main bataaya he ki dilli vishvavidhyalay main chaatr-chaatraon ke liye pehle se hi chatravaas, awaas ke liye gambheer samasya bani hui he
 Among the hostels in the colleges, seats for students of SC, ST, OBC quota are very less
 lambey samay se ujisi, emecharadi se maang kii jaati rahi he ki arakshit shrenee ke chaatro ke liye dilli vishvavidhyalay campus main chatravaas bane
 In every academic session and at the time of student union elections, assurances are given by representatives of every political party that a hostel for students of SC, ST, OBC will be constructed in the campus, but not built till date
 forum maang karata he ki jis sthaan par 39 manjila imaarat ban rahi he us jameen ko privet bilders se lekar vahaan par ambedkar ji ke naam par "ambedkar chatravaas" sthapit kiya jaae taaki yah samaaj aapako sadaiv yaad rakhega
 In the letter to the President, he has told that every year the number of reserved category candidates in Delhi University is increasing continuously
 har saal ucch shiksha (emphil, piechdi )grahan karne ke liye desh videsh se essi, asti, obisi ke chaatr aate hai lekin chatravaas main kam siton ke hone se unhen campus ke aasapaas rahane ke liye ucch daamon par cameraa lekar yaa peing guest ke rup main rahane ko majaboor hona padataa he
 If you build a hostel for a reserved category of students and a foreign student on that land, then they can do research work well by staying in the university campus
 dow
 Yadav has again demanded that instead of the 39-storey building be sent a proposal to the Central Government to build a hostel for SC, ST, OBC students so that the hostel problem for these sections can be resolved

 By now, you must have heard only stories of the Taliban's imprisonment, today you will hear from his tongue, the threat that the Taliban has given to death
 uskaa naam he vaajama
 Wajma is the anchor in a TV channel in Afghanistan and it is unbearable for the Taliban to see any woman on TV
 vaajama bataa rahi hai taliban ke kahar kii ankhodekhi daastaan
 Even the slightest disregard of the Taliban's decree turns into a punishment for which Ruh will tremble upon hearing about it, but the girls in Afghanistan have not only seen that era but also suffered it
 dekha he ki kaise kisi ladki ke khubasurat chehre par taliban phenk detaa he tejaab
 That torrent of acid has seen the girl's face as well as their entire life scorching
 taliban ke vahashipan kaa haal ya he ki burke main bhi agar koi ladki sadak par nikal jaae to taliban ke darinde uske chehre par tejaab phenk dete hai
 In such a situation, one cannot even imagine the fate of girls coming out of bin Burke's house
 taliban kii jyaadati kii ruh kampa dene vaali kahani sunaane ke liye vaajama ab tak jinda he to ye bhi mahaj sanyog he
 The Taliban have also threatened Vajma that he will kill him, cut his throat
 vaajama kaa gunaah kya he? iskaa gunaah bas itnaa he ki ye afghanistan ke ek tivi channel main ankar he, tivi par dikhti he, sadak chalati kisi aurat kaa cheharaa dikh jaae to taliban tejaab phenk dete hai phir vaajama kaa cheharaa to puri duniya dekhati he
 How can the Taliban tolerate this? hakeekat to ye he ki talibani hukumat kaa matlab he mahilaon kii jite ji maut
 Girls cannot go to school, they cannot get out of the house alone
 agar nikalnaa jaruri hi hua to unhen sir se pair tak parade main rahanaa hoga or gale main latakaana hoga taliban kii muhar vaala parichay patr
 The Taliban do not like women's make-up at all and if a woman even puts on nail polish or lipstick, she will either have to flog at the crossroads or start a shower of stones from Taliban militants
 taliban kii nazar main mahilaon kaa sabase bada gunaah he muhabbat or agar taliban ke kabze vaale ilaake main kisi mahila ne muhabbat kaa gunaah kiya, to uske liye sazaa-e-maut tay he auki taliban ko iske liye kisi saboot kii zarurat nahin hoti unke kanoon main to bas ilzaam laganaa hi sazaa ke liye kaaphi hota he
 The Taliban dictate that no woman should accompany any man on the street and that man should also be the woman's husband
 iske liye unhen shaadi kaa certificate bhi saath le kar chalanaa hoga or in farmaanon par kii taamil main choti si bhi chook hui to taliban kaa tejaab afghanistan kii khubsuurati ko barbaad karne ke liye taiyaar rahata he

 ' Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna has rejected the proposal of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and others to renovate the Kedarnath temple, saying that this work will be done by his government and the temple committee
 haalanki mukhyamantri ne kaha ki aathvin sadi ke is mandir ke punarnirmaan ke liye fund main koi bhi yogadan de saktaa he
 In an interview, Bahuguna said, 'I am firm on this and have already clarified that the temple will be constructed by the state government and the committee of the temple

 We need financial help
 hamaare paas is kaary ke liye log or ejeeniyar hai
 Bahuguna said that the state government and the temple committee welcome the suggestions but they will take the final decision in this regard
 modi ne pichley saptaah uttarakhand kii yatra par jane ke dauraan kaha tha ki gujarat sarkaar kedarnath mandir ke punarnirmaan kii jimmedaari legi
 The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand said, 'kedarnath is a religious place and it is an emotional issue

 ASI will do this job
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘iske alaava sant or hindu netaa is baat ko lekar dabaav bana rahe hai ki mandir main puja shuru kar deni chahie
 How soon we can do this is not known because Kedarnath cannot be reached on foot for at least a year
 ’mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘puja shuru ho jane ke baad vahaan puja koun karegaa, is baat kaa nirnay mandir samiti or shankaracharya lenge
 The state government will only help in this
 main isaki samay seemaa tay nahin kar saktaa yaa is par nirnay nahin le saktaa
 He said that he was thankful for the donations and relief material being received from all places and institutions
 bahuguna ne kaha, ‘hamaare vichaar alag-alag ho sakate hai lekin hamaara antim lakshya buniyadi dhaanchon ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa or uttarakhand ke logon ko behatar jivan muhaiyaa karana he
 ' bharat ke khilaaf jeet main ahm role nibhaane vaale england ke spinner monti panesar ko somvaar subah police ne pakad liya
 His crime was that he was drinking alcohol and was standing on Public Place and urinating on the bouncers of the club
 monti ravivaar raat se landan ke ek ilaake main party kar rahe the or ek time ke baad nite club ne unhen jane ko kah diya
 When he was thrown out of the club, he did it
 police ne fine lagaakar or chetavanee dekar monti ko chhod diya
 Significantly, he is the same Monty Panesar whose Akshay Kumar starrer Patiala House film was influenced by his life
 police ke mutabik 31 saal ke monti panesar ko jab logon ne braiton ilaake main public place par peshaab karte dekha, to police ko suchit kiya
 He was fined for the crime of drinking alcohol
 is ilaake kii police ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki kings road ke shoosh club ke paas somvaar tadake ek aadmi ko sharaab pikar hangaamaa karne or khule main peshaab karne ke jurm main fine kiya gaya
 The Sun, a leading newspaper in Peshbrittain who was doing bouncers, claimed that Monty Panesar was harassing the women present at the club
 vah sharaab ke nashe main dhutt the or club waalon ke samajhane par bhi nahin maan rahe the
 At this the club bouncers kicked him out
 is kadam se gussaye panesar club ke upar bani jagah par chale gaye or vahaan se khadey hokar peshaab karne lage
 The urine fell on the bouncers standing below

 SP state spokesman and cabinet minister Rajendra Chaudhary said that bjp's attempt to glorify communalism under the guise of legislators should be condemned by everyone
 choudhary ne kaha, 'bijepi kaa mul charitra hi sampradayik he or uskaa kaam algaavvaad failaana rahaa he
 The RSS, the parent organization of the BJP, was banned by the then Union Home Minister Sardar Patel after independence for the same character
 'sapa pradesh pravaktaa ne kaha ki bijepi ke donon vidhayakon ne apane bhadqau bhaashanon se mujffarnagar kii ghatana ko sampradayik rang dekar saamaajik tanabana todane or aapasi sadbhaavna bigaadane kaa kaam kiya tha
 He said, 'narendra Modi, who is the Prime Minister to become Prime Minister, has a strong intention to take the whole of India including Gujarat on the road to Gujarat
 ' rajendra choudhary ke bayaan par bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne tikhi pratikriya jataai he
 He questioned whether a family party that spoils social harmony by taking decisions on communal grounds will decide whether the BJP is a political party or not
 pathak ne sawaal kiya, 'sampradayikta kaa aarope lagane vaale bataaen ki ek samudaay vishesh kii balikaon ko laabh dena kya phirakaparasti nahin he
 Those who describe the BJP as a communal organization should increase their knowledge

 rolls kii adla-badali ke baad jo saamne aayaa wo ham sabhi ne is film main dekha
 It was also reported that Farhan Akhtar had taken 10 months to talk to Aamir Khan
 farhaan ne 10 maheene tak aamir khan ke saath appointment milane kaa intjaar kiya tha, jiske baad aamir ko film main liya ja sakaa tha
 Apart from Aamir and Saif, in the role of Saif's girlfriends, there was going to be another actress instead of Sonali Kulkarni
 asal main farhaan ne actress isha kopikar ko samir (saf) kii garlfriend puja kaa role diya tha
 However, Isha could not do this film for any reason
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki dil chahta he ne hindi cinema main ek behtareen mukaam banaaya
 The amazing thing is that the film impressed audiences of every category
 samikshakon ne bhi film kii tarif kii

 The work that i had been doing daily for the last 24 years, but that morning i was not willing to do anything, why? ”if Sachin was to be believed, it was a sign that made me feel that i should stop now

 In Maldives, the President Abdulla Yameen has imposed emergency bypassing the order of the Supreme Court
 is siyaasi sankat ke bich raashtrapati yamin kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf maldive ke vipakshi khemon or supreme court ne bharat se madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 But this time India is a bit skeptical because of China's growing influence in the Maldives
 maldive ek chota-sa desh sahi, lekin vastav main hamaare liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Let us know ten reasons why we cannot remain mute spectators on the situation in Maldives
 
 
 1
 The Maldives is strategically located in an important place in the Indian Ocean
 yah hamaare desh ke lakshadweep samooh se mahaj 700 kimi
 is far
 maldive ek aise mahatvapurn jahaaj maarg se sata hua he jisase hokar china, japan or bharat jaise kai deshon ko urja kii aapurti hoti he
 About 97 percent of India's international trade is through the Indian Ocean
 isliye yah samajha ja saktaa he ki iske margon ko surakshit karnaa bharat ke liye kitna mahatvapurn he
 2
 hind mahaasaagar ilaake main 40 se zyada desh or duniya kii kareeb 40 fisadi aabaadi he
 China began sending its ships to the Gulf of Aden in the Indian Ocean ten years ago in the name of anti-piracy operations
 isaki vajah se maldive kaa mahatv lagaataar badhata gaya or ab yah antarrashtriya bhu-raajnneeti kaa centre ban gaya he
 3
 bharat ab dakshin asia main ek mahatvapurn takat ban gaya he
 India has an important role in maintaining security in the Indian Ocean region
 iske liye bharat ko suraksha or pratiraksha ke kshetra main maldive ke saath sahyog kaayam karnaa hoga
 4
 china kaa maldive ke saath badhata aarthik sahyog bharat ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 China accounts for about 70 per cent of the Maldives' external debt
 iske pehle dashakon tak maldive ke bharat ke saath kareebi rishte rahe hai
 The Chinese Embassy opened there only in 2011
 bharat iske kaaphi pehle 1972 main hi vahaan apana duutavas khol chukaa tha
 So now India will have to take some steps to reduce this domination of China
 maujuuda raajnneetik sankat iske liye ek mauka he
 5
 bharat or maldive kaa dashakon purana dharmik, saanskrithik, saamaajik or kaarobaari rishta he
 India is among the first countries to be recognized after Maldives gained independence in 1965
 isliye maldive hamaare liye mahatvapurn he
 6
 maldive main kareeb 25,000 bhartiya rahete hai, jo doosraa sabase bada videshi samudaay he
 About 6 percent of the tourists visiting Maldives every year are from India
 vahaan khaskar bollywood celebraties chhuttiyaan manaanaa pasand karte hai
 Many Bollywood films have also been shot there
 7
 a large number of citizens from Maldives to India also come for education, treatment and business
 bharat main ucch shiksha yaa upachaar ke liye long turm vija hasil karne vaale maldive ke nagarikon kii sankhya dinodin bad rahi he
 8
 maldive kii jansankhya kaa bada hissaa yah chahta he ki is sankat ke daur main bharat madad kare
 Among them are opposition parties such as former President Nasheed's party MDP and their supporters
 9
 Maldives is a member country of SAARC
 saarc membharat kii bhoomika ek agua raashtra kii tarah he
 If this continues, then there are chances of moving out of SAARC ahead of Maldives
 isliye bharat ke liye yah jaruri he ki use kisi tarah saarc main banaaya rakhaa jaae
 Maldives is the only country in SAARC where PM Modi has not visited
 10 
 Maldives is a Sunni Muslim majority country
 maujuuda raashtrapati yamin ne desh main dharmik kattarta ko badhaava diya he
 It is believed that a large number of youth from Maldives have gone to Syria and joined ISIS
 kamjor maldive dharmik ativaadiyon aurkattarpathiyonki panaahagaah ban saktaa he
 Apart from this, smuggling and drug trade can also increase there
 yah sab bharat kii chintaa badhaane vaali baaten hai
 We already have a religious fundamentalist country like Pakistan, we cannot afford another Islamic fundamentalist country in the neighborhood, this has to be curbed

 unhone kaha, 'rahamaanke khilaaf fatwa bahut durbhagyapurna he or isse kahin durbhagyapurna isamen maujuud badale kii bhaavana he
 He composed the tune for a film which is not based on any religion
 surendra jain ne samvaadadaataaon kaha, 'manrahamanse apil karuunga ki vah laut aaen, unhen ghar vaapasi kerani chahie
 Hindu society is waiting for its son
 ham naa sirf bahen failaa kar unka swaagat karenge balki yah sunishchit bhi karenge ki unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunche, chaahe kitne bhi fatwa kyon na jari ho jaae
 'ghar Wapsi' is a controversial program run by certain Hindu organizations that aims to bring Muslims and Christians back to Hinduism
 irani nirdeshak maajid maazidi ne film ‘mohammad: massenger of god’ kaa nirdesan kiya he
 The Raja Academy in Mumbai objected to the film and issued a fatwa against Oscar Vijeta Rahmanatha and Majidi, calling the film against Islam
 e aar rahmaanne kaha he ki unhone isaki dhun nek niyat se banaai or kisi ko aahat karne kaa iraadaa nahin tha
 The VHP also supported the statement by Union Minister Mahesh Sharma under which Hinduism texts such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Gita should be made part of the school curriculum
 saath hi unhone kaha ki samaaj main mulyon ko behaal karne ke liye or aparaadh ko rokane ke liye naitik shiksha padhaanaa jaruri he
 When asked about the sacred texts of other religions, Jain said that it should be seen whether they too prefer values like Hindu books

 Will the impact of GST now be seen on Sridevi's film Mom? Since GST, which came into force from 1 July, while many things have become expensive on the one hand, the prices of some have also fallen
 lekin film dekhne waalon ke liye GST kaa aana kitna phydemand rahaa or kitna nuksaan jhelana hoga, ye samajhane vaali baat he
 Tickets are cheap in Mumbai, there is no effect in Delhi till now, the state's entertainment tax was included in the ticket price
 ise hataakar ek hi tex GST ab se lagaaya jayega
 In this way, ticket prices are reduced in some places, then there will be no effect in many places
 kisi he shridevi kii film mom, jaane is rivyuu main
 
 
 Explain that the film ticket has been kept in the 28 percent tax slab in the GST
 yani maharashtra main jahaan pehle 40% antertenment tex dena padataa tha vahiin ab 28% GST ke baad dena hoga
 In this way ticket rates in Mumbai will be reduced
 isi tarah dilli main lagbhag pehle bhi isi tex slab main tikat ke rate the
 So after the arrival of GST, Bollywood fans of Delhi will not be much difference
 jabaki isi ke pados main yani noida-gajiabad main film tikat ke daam kuch kam honge
 The emotional drama is Salman's tubelight but these are also flaws in the film
 
 
 kya tex free ho sakengi filmencchhi va soshal messej dene vaali filmon ko adhik se adhik darshakon tak pahunchane ke liye in par se tex hataa diya jaataa tha
 It completely depended on the states because tax free meant the withdrawal of entertainment tax and it was imposed by the state government
 lekin ab GST ko state or central, donon jagah kii sarkaar baantengi
 Yogesh, the manager of Wave Cinema, says that in such a situation, the state government can reduce the tax on its share
 lekin isamen daam main kitna fark aayega, iske liye abhi thodaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 The most important issue has come up in Phulu, know what is the matter
 
 
 haalanki yogesh kaa kahana he ki har saal bijli ke rate or mentanence cost badhane se GST ke baad theatre maalikon kaa kharch bad saktaa he
 What more will have to be paid for making internet booking? The emphasis is on internet booking of movie tickets in Passion days
 iske liye bhi alag se tex dena padataa he
 Will their rates also vary? In this regard, Yogesh says that the government is planning to levy some charge on the transaction of all e-commerce sites
 haalanki is par abhi kuch tay nahin hua he
 Therefore, there will not be much difference in the rate of tickets in internet booking at the moment
 jodi acchhee phir kyon nahin impress kar pai rabta, jaane vajah
 
 
 Food and drink will increase if you buy a lot of nachos, cold drinks, popcorn during a movie outing, then you have to lighten the pockets a little more
 GST ke baad inke rate kareeb 3 pratishat tak bade hai
 That is, where you used to pay 15 percent tax on buying 300 things, it has now increased to 18 percent
 ab filmon kii kamai par GST kaa kitna asar padataa he, iske liye to MOM ke saath hi jagga jasoos kii relies kaa intjaar bhi karnaa hoga
 Because in a way big commercial film will be considered as ranbir-katrina starrer

 westeindies ne isisi vishwa tii20 championships ke super-10 ke group-ek ke match main buudhvaar ko mumbai main khele gaye mukaable main england ko chah wicket se haraa diya
 West Indies batsman Chris Gayle hit a six-over so that the English bowler was upset
 kris gail ne sirf 48 gendon main 11 chhakkon or 5 chaukon ke saath 100 ran kii naabad pari kheli
 Thanks to Gayle's blistering innings, the West Indies achieved the tricky target of 183 from England with 11 balls to spare
 westeindies kii ore se gail ke alaava marlan sampuls ne 37 ranon kii pari kheli
 Andre Russell also remained unbeaten on 12 runs
 england kii ore se david villi, ris tople, adil raashid or moin ali ne ek-ek wicket hasil kiye
 Earlier, all six of England's top batsmen reached double digits, putting up a strong score of 182 for six against the West Indies
 westeindies ne toss jitkar pehle fielding kaa faisla kiya, lekin uski gendbaaji main painaapan nahin dikhaa
 For England, Joe Root scored the most 48 runs after facing 36 balls
 unhone elex helles (26 gend par 28) ke saath shuruaati das overon main ran banane kaa jimmaa uthaaya
 While Jos Buttler (30 off 20 balls), captain Eoin Morgan (27 not out from 14 balls) and Ben Stokes (15 off seven balls) scored runs in the death overs
 england ne aakhri chaar overon main 54 ran banaae
 The strike rate of every England batsman was in increasing order, which can be gauged that they also increased the run pace as the innings progressed
 andre rasel or dwen braavo ne westeindies kii taraf se do-do wicket liye, lekin unhone bhi anya gendbaajon kii tarah ran lutaae
 The England batsmen initially tried to test the circumstances
 pehle do overon main paanch ran bane lekin jerome tailor kaa apane duusare over main line or length ke liye jujhna england ke liye phydemand sabit hua
 The over scored 18 runs, including two fours from Jason Rai
 duusari taraf tailor ke saath gendbaaji kaa aagaaj karne vaale badri ke duusare over main helles ne lagaataar teen chauke lagaae
 Hales, however, did not play as fast as expected
 unhone suleman ben kii flite leti gend par bold hone se pehle 25 gendon par 28 ran banaae
 Russell came in his second spell to prevent Root from scoring a half-century
 root ne lanbaa shot khelkar pachaasa puraa karnaa chaha, lekin gend seemaa rekha par khadey tailor ke haathon main samaa gai
 Root hit three fours and two sixes
 deth overon main score ko gati dene kii jimmedaari butler or morgan kii thi, jise unhone bakhubi nibhaayaa
 Butler sent the balls of Brady, Suleman Benn and Dwayne Bravo for six runs
 braavo par ek or chakka lagane ke prayaas main unhone bhi seemaa rekha par kaich thamaya
 The comments isse koi asar nahin padaa kyonki unka sthaan lene ke liye utre stokes ne rasel par chaukaa or chakka jadkar shuruyaat kii
 Two wickets fell in the last over of Bravo but in the meantime, 18 runs were also scored including sixes from Morgan and Moeen Ali

 Those who claim to be the guard of culture may have a different face
 ye kuch or kitna bhayanak or sharmnaak ho saktaa he iskaa puraa sach ajtak ne tahalaka ke saath milakar ujagar kiya he
 What is the real business of those who dare to die in order to save dignity in the society! Pictures of girls being tricked out of Mangalore's pub by raping them will still be alive in your mind and such a treat with girls You will not forget Pramod Muthalik, the head of the organization, Shri Ram Sena
 mutalik kii yaad ham aapako isaliye dilaa rahe hai kyonki ham usee mutalik ke asli chehre se rubaru karaane ja rahe hai
 The true face of Mutalik and his henchmen is hidden under the cover of protecting religion and culture
 ajtak or tahalaka kii team ne apane camere main wo sach kaid kiya he jo batayega ki mutalik rashtriyata, parampara or samskruti kaa paharaadaar banane kaa jo daawa karata he darasal wo ek fareb he
 The truth is that Mutalik does business under the guise of religion
 ek khaas dharm kii raksha karne kii aad main bhaade ke gundo ko bhejkar todphod karaane kaa dhandha karne vaale pramod muttalik ne apni party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prasad attavar se baat karne kii baat kahi to tahalaka-ajtak kii team attavar se milane nikal padi
 After a lot of effort, when we met Attavar and we knew the truth, the ground slipped under the feet and we claim that you too will be shocked
 aaiye ham aapako bataate hai shriram sena ke mukhiya mutalik kaa ek or sach
 Pramod Muthalik, the head of the Shri Ram army, is Prasad Attavar
 attavar ke bare main baaki kuch bataane se pehle ham aapako bataate hai jithesh ke bare main jo yah daawa karata he ki shriram sena ke mukhiya pramod mutalik kii ek aawaaj par wo kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 After several days of special screening in Mangalore, he took us to Prasad Attavar when Jitesh collided with Tehelka reporters
 ji haa prasad attavar, jiskaa zikr ham aapse pehle bhi kar chuke hai or ye bhi bataa chuke hai ki ye pramod mutalik kaa daayan haath he
 When Tehelka started investigating about this person, it was found that Attavar underworld don has gone to jail for extortion from businessmen for Ravi Pujari
 lihaaja hamane iskaa sach tatolna shuru kiya or phir isane khud hi apana asli cheharaa hamaare saamne rakh diya
 Atavar said to us in the conversation that if you give money, why would Karnataka only vandalize any exhibition in Maharashtra, West Bengal and Orissa
 isapar hamane attavar se pradarshnee ko lekar anderworld kii dhamkee kii baat rakhi
 Excerpts from the conversation between Aaj tak-tehelka and Attavar
 tehelka-aaj Tak: This can happen inside our exhibition
 
 
 ravi pujari koi coment kar de media ke andanttavar: kyon?tahalaka-ajtak: usase hame or publicity mil jaegiatavar: wo kaise?tahalaka-ajtak: mil jaegiatavar: kaise?tahalaka-ajtak: kisi bhi nazariye se
 
 
 He will have to think
 maan lo uskaa jo virdohi gang he uski koi tasviir pradarshnee main laga denge or wo dhamkee de ki hamane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 If you do something similar
 attavar: tasviir
 
 
 Photo: tahlka-aaj Tak: It will be tremendous
 Atavar: Leave it
 
 He will do it
 
 
 wo bhi karegrittavar kii baat kaa matlab samajhen to pradarshnee ko surkhiyon main laane ke liye ye shaks attavar, anderworld kii dhamkee kaa intjaam bhi kara saktaa he
 This is not only true of the business of rioting
 ham attavar kaa puraa cheharaa dekhnaa chaahate the isaliye baat kaa silsilaa jari rakhaa auki phir thodi hi der main usne police ke saath setting kaa sach bhi ugal diya
 Attavar said that the police will have to act with confidence
 police ko paise dekar ‘set’ karnaa hoga
 This will prove the police to arrest arrests after violence as normal
 hinsa karne vaale ladakon par maamuli dharaaen lagavani hongi
 Attavar said the boys who perpetrated the violence would be from outside Mangalore
 is puri baat chit se kuch baaten shishe kii tarah saaf hai ki auki wo ye ki pramod muthalik ke logon ke anderworld se bhi rishte hai
 Pramod Muthalik's henchmen use the underworld to benefit
 samskruti kii duhai dekar dange kaa dhandha kiya jaataa he
 The people of Mutalik have a setting with the police to make it easy to mess up, with money and these shopkeepers of violence mislead the innocent
 lekin isi dauraan prasad attavar ko police giraftaar kar leti he or hamaari deal kii baat ruk jaati he
 Prasad Attavar was kept in Bellary, the safest jail in Karnataka
 par prasad attavar kitna taqatvar he or aasaani se police-prashasan ko apane haq main kar letaa he
 Prasad Attavar reached the underworld on the charge of extortion on the Bellary Jail of Karnataka Aaj tak-tehelka's campaign to expose him did not stop here
 hamaare samvaadadaata pahunche bellari jail or vahaan par attavar kaa khoonkhaar cheharaa ho gaya benakaab ki kaise paise ke liye shriram sena kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh apana imaan bechata he
 Prasad Attavar, who was imprisoned in jail, made such revelations that would stir up
 jail main band hone ke baavjood attavar danke kii chot par bhaade main fasaad karwaane kii puri guarantee le rahaa tha
 Part of what happened to Attavar in the negotiation of this guarantee: tehelka-aaj Tak: There will be fifty boys who vandalize
 
 
 danga
 
 tip karegrittavar: haa
 
 
 absolutely
 
 
 wo ye
 
 
 All done
 
 
 pub kaa
 
 
 Exactly like hithalka-aaj Tak: Just like what i did in the pub
 
 
 dangattavar: haantahalaka-ajtak: jaisaa pub main kiya usase achgauttavar: ye pub kaa kaisaa hua
 
 
 Better than that 
 
 tahalaka-ajtak: haavattavar: ye vaada he
 
 
 You all over the national media
 
 
 tahalaka-ajtak: kawarej mil jayega
 
 
 ? Attavar: Yes, you will get coverage
 
 
 neshnal media main sab setting main karata hum
 
 
 Atavar is saying that he will get a big break from the pub sabotage and get media coverage too
 mangalore jail main attavar se jab hamaari duusari mulaakaat hui to usne is baar hamen paise par fasaad karne kaa arthshaastra bataaya
 Attavar opened the entire story of the relationship with the underworld
 saath hi yah bhi khulaasa kar diya ki kaise bhaade main anderworld kii dhamkee bhi bikati he
 Attavar: No
 
 No
 
 
 mangalore yatahalaka-ajtak: mysoretavar: mysore? dono jagah par main setting karegatahalaka-ajtak: paisa kitna lagegaa?attavar-nahin
 
 
 It is not right to talk here
 attavar- mangalore main
 
 
 tehelka-aaj Tak: Yes there should be 200 workers in the exhibition attavar-hanthalka-aaj Tak: Like pubs, there should be sabotage
 Atavar-what i say
 
 
 wo sab main karegaa
 
 
 You know Ravi Pujari
 
 
 tahalaka-ajtak: jchhattavar- ravi pujari ko apane saath main legaa
 
 
 i had told you earlier? Prasad Atawar, the special head of Shriram army chief Pramod Muthalik, took the guarantee of arranging everything from sabotage to underworld don
 is baatcheet ke baad attavar ko mangalore jail se bellari jail bhej diya gaya
 So tehelka-aajtak team reached Bellary jail to meet Attavar
 yahaan bhi attavar kaa asar dikh rahaa tha
 In a separate room, we were met with Attavar
 attavar: pement ke bare main
 
 
 ? tehelka-aaj Tak: Yes, how much? Attavar: What i say now
 
 
 ek jagah par hona he?tahalaka-ajtak: do jagah, mysore or mangaloretavar: paise ke bare main kaise baat karuntahalaka-ajtak: police kii setting kaa he
 Belongs to the organization
 ladkaa logon kaa he or aapkaa he
 How much to give kul kitna dena he
 You have to do the whole setting and what is Ravi Pujari's
 attavar: wo bhi main hi karegaa
 
 
 Right now, this is going on in Delhi
 
 
 aap ek kaam kiijie ki aap mujhe apana phone number dijie
 tehelka-aaj Tak: You will work
 Atavar: hanthalka-aaj Tak: 50 boys will sabotage my paintings
 Atavar: hanthalka-aaj Tak: a riot will be typed in the city as well
 Atavar: They will do it too
 
 
 dekhenge aap kaisaa?shriram sena ke pramukh pramod mutalik ne jab theke par hinsa failaane kii hami bhari, tab usne ye bhi bataaya ki bangalore main bhi ye kaam ho saktaa he
 Muthalik himself told the tehelka-aajtak reporter to meet his special man Vasant Kumar Bhavani in Bangalore
 ye bhavani vahi shaks he, jo mangalore main pub par hamale ke baad shriram sena kaa pravaktaa banakar media main surkhiyaan bator rahaa tha
 After making sure we spoke to Pramod Muthalik for unnecessarily spreading violence in the exhibition, our destination was Bangalore city, where Vasant Kumar Bhavani, Pramod Muthalik's most loyal partner and Bangalore City Chief of Sri Ram Sena lives
 vasant kumaar bhavani vahi shaks he, jo mangalore ke pub main hamale ke baad shriram sena kaa pravaktaa bana phir rahaa tha
 On the day of Valentine's Day, when some people had soaked granddaughter on the face of Pramod Muthalik, Bharamani was also a counter attack from the Shri Ram army
 bhavani thik-thaak paise vaala he or pramod muthalik kaa sabase khaas saathi bhavani hi he
 Regarding Bhavani, Muthalik himself said that Bhavani is very expert in the work of spreading violence
 pramod muthalik- main kya bataa rahaa hum
 
 vahaan ke hamaare president hai
 Reporter- Bangalore
 
 ? Pramod Muthalik- of Bangalore
 
 
 wo bhi bahut strang hai
 
 aapse parichay ho gaya?ab aap jaan gaye honge ki muthalik or shriram sena ke liye kitni ahmiyat rakhata he bhavani
 Bhavani met at a small cafe in Jayanagar area of bangalore
 bhavani ne baatcheet ke dauraan apana puraa plan samajhaana shuru kiya ki bangalore ke kis ilaake main pradarshnee lagaana or pradarshnee main hinsa failaana behatar hoga
 Bhavani - You know this Rabindra Kalakshetra, don't you? 
 
 ?reporter- haa
 
 haa
 
 bhavani- uske peeche ek khulaa stage he
 
 reporter- kitna croud aa saktaa he usamen
 
 
 ? Bhavani - two thousand
 
 
 reporter- do hazaar
 
 lekin wo sampradayik taur par to samvedansheel he naa?bhavani- communalawiz bhi sensitive he
 
 bole to udhar se market bahut najadik he
 
 
 Reporter- City Market? Bhavani- City Market
 
 
 reporter- haa phir to udhar muslim aria he
 
 bhavani- isliye wo jagah bahut acha he aapke liye
 
 shivaji nagar se vahaan bahut acha scope he, kyonki vahaan bagal main muslim population bhi bahut zyaada he
 
 
 Bhavani knows well in which area it is easy to spread violence
 kala pradarshnee ke naam par hinsa failaane kii baat ho rahi thi or vasant kumaar naam kaa ye shaatir ab hamen ye samajha rahaa tha ki jis ilaake main wo hinsa failaana chahta he, us jagah kaa phayda kya he
 
 ?reporter- haa city market main to he
 
 lekin udhar commercial aria zyaada pad jaataa he udhar
 
 
 Bhavani- For whatever you are thinking, it suits you there
 
 
 reporter- hamaari jo profile he usko suut karata he
 
 ?bhavani- usko suut karata he
 
 shivajinagar se zyaada suut he
 
 shivaji nagar ek remote aria ho gaya, ye floating zyaada he
 
 
 Reporter- If done Shivaji Nagar, it will be there
 
 
 vahaan par agucated class nahin he to vahaan kyon kar rahaa he
 
 
 If marketed city
 
 Bhavani- You are getting this match for the idea and for this concept
 
 Because your gallery is not going to be viewed by eliterate
 
 If you will see this 
 Upper Class
 
 Middle class
 
 
 reporter- elit class
 
 bhavani ko pataa he ki jahaan apper class ke logon kii bheed hogi, vahaan tod-phod karne se zyaada surkhiyaan milengi
 The place where Bhavani was talking about spreading violence had another benefit
 bhavani jaanata tha ki aisi jagah par puri taiyaari ke saath hinsa failaane ke baad bhi kisi ko shaq nahin hoga ki sab kuch pehle se tay tha
 Bhavani - Upper class will see more
 
 So upper class
 
 
 aap shivaji nagar main rakhenge to koun aayega
 
 ye pre-pland lagegaa sabko
 
 
 Reporter- Hmmm
 
 Bhavani- If Shivaji Nagar did it
 
 
 haa ye agar ek diarection se sochenge to sahi baat he lekin usko zyaada hawa nahin milegaa
 
 
 Reporter- Yes
 
 People may get somewhere
 
 
 kahin under teble alliance he
 
 bhavani- lag sakati he
 
 
 Vasant Kumar Bhavani agreed to spread violence during the exhibition in Bangalore
 wo ek-ek pahalu par gaur karne ke baad puraa plan taiyaar kar chukaa tha or apni diary dekhne ke baad usne pradarshnee main hinsa failaane ke liye sabase acha din bhi bataaya
 He knew that more people would gather to see the exhibition in the weekend
 
 So he chose the weekend to spread violence
 bhavani- weekend dangon ke liye thik rahata he
 The weekend will be more crowded and a bigger scene will be created
 police ke saath setting kaa jugad ham kar lenge
 But first let us decide the matter of money
 basant kumaar bhavani kii baton se aap samaj sakate hai ki bangalore main danga bhadakaana uske liye maamuli si baat he
 He was guaranteeing work
 basharte ki use manachaaha daam mili
 Vasant Kumar Bhavani
 shriram sena kaa bangalore city kaa pramukh ye shaks hamaari-aapaki soch se bhi zyaada shaatir he
 He not only suggested a place to spread violence by taking money, but also said that by making the chief guest, the work of spreading violence will be easy and when it came to money, Bhavani presented a rate list of each work
 bangalore main pramod muthalik ke rhite hand vasant kumaar bhavani ne hinsa failaane ke liye city market kii jagah kyon chuni, ye to aap sun hi chuke hai
 This was the first part of his plan
 ye bhi isi shaatir kaa idia tha ki agar pradarshnee main kisi muslim netaa ko chif guest banaaya jaae, to shriram sena kaa kaam or bhi aaraam se hoga
 Bhavani also suggested the name of the leaders to become the Chief Guest
 bhavani- mumtaj ali ko hi bulaaie naa
 
 
 Reporter - Whom
 
 ? Bhavani - to Mumtaz Ali
 
 Reporter- Who is this? 
 
 ?bhavani- vakf board kaa ministar he naa
 
 
 now
 
 
 reporter- karnataka se
 
 ?bhavani- haa
 
 
 Reporter - he will come
 
 What an age Mumtaz Ali will be 
 ? Bhavani - is above Fifty
 
 
 chif guest kaa naam sujhane ke baad bhavani ne ye bataanaa shuru kiya ki hinsa failaane se pehle kya-kya taiyaari kerani he
 He told that an ambulance is also needed on the spot
 kyonki pehle se tay hinsa main kitna khun-kharaba hoga, ye to bhavani bhi nahin jaanata
 Bhavani- i cannot give assurance of this
 
 
 aapkaa damege kitna hoga
 
 damege to hoga
 
 lekin kitna hoga, ye guarantee nahin de saktaa
 
 
 Because our boys are very ferocious (furious) boys
 
 
 wo aage-peeche nahin dekhte
 
 reporter- ek baar kiya to kiya
 
 
 Bhavani - done
 
 
 main unako awoid bhi nahin kar saktaa, kyonki mere upar bhadak jaaenge
 
 
 When the leader is ferroceous, his followers will also be ferroceous
 
 
 itnaa main aapako bolnaa chahta hum
 
 
 There will be damage but how much
 
 i can not speak 
 It is clear from Bhawani's talk that his gang is for hire
 
 
 tod-phod karne waalon kii puri fouj he
 He was telling us that once his boys became uncontrollable, they would be difficult to control
 isiilie bhavani bataa rahaa tha ki ambulance taiyaar rakhana padegaa
 Reporter - Public beating can occur
 
 
 ?bhavani- ho sakati he
 
 
 Those who come there come to them
 
 
 kyonki ye sab bhi kar dete hai hamaare ladke
 
 
 Porter - If the crowd comes, then there is no control
 
 Bhavani - There is no control
 
 Reporter - Ambulance will have to be kept ready
 
 Bhavani - Absolutely
 
 
 wo bhi ho saktaa he
 
 wo phir mere log hai
 
 jab lete hai naa kuch
 
 
 Then they have to explain
 
 
 bolnaa padataa he
 
 
 The case will be longer
 
 There is more case than before
 
 
 control karo
 
 
 Only a little of what this display is
 
 
 ye
 
 
 Reporter- Damage
 
 
 bhavani- damege karo
 
 
 Do not touch people
 
 
 reporter- ye sunate nahin hai lekin
 
 bhavani- itnaa to main samajha duungaa lekin
 
 
 Can not speak
 
 There is only one half, break what you got but break it
 
 There are such mad people
 
 Bhavani came to the point after stating a plan to spread violence during the exhibition
 yani ki danga failaane ke evaj main daam kitna milegaa?reporter- unhone mujhe do line bolaa tha
 
 sanghathan ke liye alag
 
 kaaryakarta ke liye alag
 
 
 So i made 5 lakhs for the organization
 
 Then you will see it
 
 It will be at the level of the workers that if the case falls, it is okay
 
 50 thousand for the workers
 
 
 kuch usko mil jayega
 
 kuch uske cese main yuz ho jayega
 
 
 5 lakh if ten boys come
 
 He spoke to me like this
 
 What do you do of the organization is with Muthalik ji and boy
 
 
 wo main aapako khud duungaa
 
 police kaa jo setting he
 
 wo bhi karke duungaa
 
 ki wo bhi karnaa padegaa
 
 
 Bhavani - Police setting will also have to be done
 
 
 bina uskaa nahin hoga
 
 
 This talk of Bhavani is very surprising
 wo hinsa failaane kaa theka le rahaa he or hinsa failaane se pehle hi police ke saath setting karne kii baat bhi kah rahaa he
 For this, he was engaged in fixing a separate amount in the deal
 reporter- nahin
 
 
 Will happen
 
 So going in 3 phases over there
 
 
 3 diemensional
 
 
 Different of organization
 
 Workers separate and police separate
 
 
 bhavani- police kaa alag
 
 
 Bhavani was also taking utmost care in the deal to spread violence
 usne bangalore main hinsa failaane ke evaj main pehle hamase hamaare bajet ke bare main poocha or phir ye poochne laga ki mangalore main is kaam ke liye shriram sena ke upaadhyaksh prasad atavar ne kitne paison main hami bhari he
 
 
 The It was a clear indication from Bhavani that there is a competition between him and Atawar in the riot business, who can earn how much money for the organization
 gundgardee or dange-fasaad kaa jaal khufia camere main kaid ho chukaa tha
 All the talk was done
 tay ho chukaa tha ki kaise-kaise diya jayega tod-phod ko anjaam
 Money was also negotiated with a man from Muthalik
 ab bas muthalik kii muhar lagani baaki thi
 Our team again reached Muthalik
 is baar muthalik kii jubaan jaraa badali hui si thi
 i do not know what was the matter in the last meeting, who was talking about his goons and hooligans, who were listening to the voice of the soul
 haalanki, muthalik kii ye baaten bas apni chhavi ko bachaae rakhane ke liye thim
 If his image is not stained, then he is ready to do anything
 ham ye isaliye bhi kah rahe hai kyonki thodi der main hi muthalik apni puraani baton par laut aae
 They were ready that their people would get killed
 taiyaar the ki paisa lekar unke gunde tay jagah par todphod karne pahunch jaaenge
 The point is clear and that Muthalik himself does not directly deal with money
 lekin unhen pataa hota he ki paise kahaan or kaise pahunch rahe hai
 In the revelations of Aaj tak-tehelka, it is clear that Pramod Muthalik, who has opened a shop for hooliganism in the name of tradition and culture, is running very well with his colleagues
 tafsil se bataate hai aapako ki dange ke dhandhe kii company kaise kaam karti he muthalik ke ishaare par
 How Pramod Muthalik, the head of Shriramsena, runs the shop of religion for money
 kaise hindu samskruti ke naam par dange karti he muthalik kii company
 Pramod Muthalik, the head of the Sri Ram Sena, takes the supari of the riots
 wo paise rupye kii baat nahin karata or supaari apane karinde prasad attavar ko de detaa he
 Prasad Attavar deals with the person making headlines by committing violence on the basis of money
 paise kii baat karata he or phir apane saathi basant kumaar bhavani ko theka de detaa he
 Basant makes a complete strategy on how much money, how many people will protest violence on which issue, and on which sections the police will arrest and on which sections will be prosecuted
 kis shahar main danga karne ke liye kis shahar se aadmi pahunchengen or phir jab paise rupye or puri ranneeti kaa byoraa taiyaar ho jaataa he to pramod mutalik-deal final karata he
 Then Basant and Attavar hand over their Karind priests, Jitesh and Kumar to deal with the rioting business
 ye teenon dangaiyon kaa intjaam karte hai
 Tells them what to break and what to leave
 wo tay karte hai ki kise peetna he or kiske munh par kaalikh potni he or vahi tay karte hai ki hinsa ko kis anjaam tak pahunchaana he
 This is how Muthalik's company operates
 duniya sochati he ki ugr hinduvadi sanghathan samskruti kii raksha kii ladaai lard rahe hai par hakeekat ye he ki wo to bas paisa kamaane ke liye logon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or kuch log paise ke dam par hinsa kaa theka de surkhiyaan bator rahe hote hai

 Akhilesh Pandey is now seen to be tightening the grip of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat
 darasal, 30 sitambar ko uttarakhand hycourt ne sibiai ko ravat ke khilaaf 2016 main vidhayakon ke kathith kharid-farokht ke sting maamle main exiar darj karne kii anumati de di
 Earlier on September 3, the CBI informed the High Court that it had completed the investigation of the case and that it wanted to file an FIR soon
 us sting video main ravat satta main bane rahane ke liye baghawat karne vaale vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye kathith rup se saudebaaji karte dikhaai de rahe the
 On the basis of this video, on March 31, 2016, the CBI inquiry against Rawat started after the recommendation of the Governor
 vahiin, raashtrapati shashan khatm hone or sarkaar behaal hone ke baad tatkaaleen harish ravat sarkaar ne 15 may, 2016 ko is cese kii jaanch sibiai ke bajaay esaity se karwaane kii sifarish kar di thi
 But this matter remained with the CBI
 iske baad giraftaar se bachane ke liye ravat hycourt kii sharan main chale gaye or adaalat ne sibiai ko aadesh diya tha ki koi bhi karrwai karne se pehle vah court se anumati le
 On the other hand, rebel Harak Singh Rawat from Congress also filed a petition in the High Court challenging the order of May 15, 2016 of the state government
 ab hycourt donon hi yachikaaon kii ek saath sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 It also includes a challenge to the Governor's recommendation for a CBI inquiry
 apane haalia aadesh main adaalat ne kaha ki sibiai is maamle main exiar darj karne or jaanch shuru karne ke liye swatantra he, par uske antim aadesh tak ravat ko giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa or uske aadesh ke baad hi sibiai aage kii karrwai kare
 The next hearing of the case will be on November 1
 ravat kii pairvi kar rahe supreme court ke vakil or purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ke anusaar, ''hycourt ne kaha he ki sibiai chaahe to exiar darj kar sakati he, par faisla is par aadhaarit hoga ki agar 31 march, 2016 kaa rajyapal kaa aadesh galat niklaa to sibiai koi prosicution nahin kar sakati
 Meanwhile, various factions of Uttarakhand Congress are seen standing with Rawat
 ravat se ekajutata dikhaane ke liye pradesh congress adhyaksh preetam singh, netaa pratipaksh indira hridayesh, purv pradesh adhyaksh kishor upaadhyaay or purv cabinet mantri tilak raaj behad nainital pahunche or unhone bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or centre sarkaar par ravat ke khilaaf sajeesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He alleged that the Central Government is trying to hold Sajishan Rawat under misuse by using the CBI
 preetam singh ne naaraazgi jataate hue kaha, ''centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ne pichhali congress sarkaar ko giraane kii sajeesh kii thi
 The BJP broke the Congress mlas
 lekin pralobhan dekar sarkaar giraane waalon par karrwai karne ke bajaae sting ke bahaane ravat par hi karrwai karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 shaayar gulzaar se meri mulaakaat kuch saal pehle hui thi, jab unki beti meghna or meri beti ranjita ne saath main ek film banaai-just marid
 It was a very simple and deep film
 mujhe ummid thi ki acchhee chalegi, lekin hamaara box offis aisi sidhi-saral filmon ke prati hameshaa bahut udaar nahin hota, khaskar agar film main thodi budghimatta or samajhadaari bhi ho
 Just Married was one such film
 haalanki gulzaar kehete hai ki ve ‘‘70 ke dashak se mujhe jaanate the, jab ve akasar kolkata jaaya karte the
 While traveling in small bookstores gleaming along the road, i would often buy books of my poems and make them part of my library
 lekin is bare main ve bahut kam jaanate hai ki takreeban vahi vakt tha, jab main kolkata ke un jane-maane vishalkay cinema haul ke neem syah andhere main baitha badi hasarat or achraj se un filmon ko dekha karata tha, jo unhone likhi or nirdeshit kii thim
 There was something about his language, his imagination and even his silence
 jis tarah unki filmon main bich-bich main ek sannata pasarataa tha, main shabdon or bimbon kii us aadmi kii samaj or pratibha ke prati aashcharya se bhar jaataa
 If you talk to me about comedy, the first film that comes to my mind is Grapes
 agar aap stri-purush sambandhon ke rahasy kii baat karen to koshish film kaa khyaal jehan main kaundh jaataa he
 Politics? The film Storm defines the politics of its time in many forms and meanings

 Weather discovers the relationship between a father and his prostitute daughter
 or arvind kejariwal ke paridrishy main aane se bahut pehle film hututu ne bharat main teji se bad rahe bhrashtachar par lathi chalaai thi
 More than 40 years have passed
 gulzaar ne kai saal se koi film nahin banaai
 Actually he did not make any film in the early 14 years of the 21st century
 (unki aakhri film hututu 1999 main bani thi
 ) But almost every year he gets to win the best lyricist award for his song written for some film
 gulzaar jab filmein banaaya karte the, tab se lekar ab tak cinema kaaphi badal chukaa he
 Likewise, the world of hit songs has also changed a lot
 lekin saal-dar-saal guzar jane ke baad bhi gulzaar ke shabdon kaa jaadu barkaraar he
 His songs are winning the hearts of the generation who may not even know that Gulzar has made some very memorable films of his time and he is also named among the three great personalities of Hindi cinema Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherjee
 
 unki kavitaayen bhi umr ke saath zyada tikhi or gahari ho gai hai
 The images, simplicity and depth of the poems take over your mind and heart
 maine unhen darshakon ke saamne padhate hue dekha he
 They immediately form a magical relationship with the audience
 ve kisi ko prabhavit karne kii koshish nahin kar rahe
 They are just telling what they saw, touched, felt
 aashcharya yah ki unke shabd aapke bheetar kahin gahare utarate jate hai or aapako ve chijen thik waisi hi najar aane lagati hai
 It is possible, you may have seen them before, but never would have thought that they could fill such a unique magic in your life
 mujhamen itani pratibha kabhi thi hi nahin
 So i quit writing poems while becoming a full-time journalist
 mujhe pataa tha ek kavi or patrkaar ke rup main shabdon ke saath sangharsh mere liye mumkin hi nahin tha
 a journalist who gets paid for writing and who in a few hours makes a whet of thousands of words
 lagbhag do dashakon ke baad main kavita kii ore lautaa or mujhe aashcharya nahin ki apni har nai kitaab ke launch main maine gulzaar ko maujuud paaya
 Gulzar did not have to struggle to maintain the integrity and honesty of his words
 shabd khud-ba-khud unke paas chale aate hai
 Poetry, story, prose, songs and even film writing
 sab unke rachanaatmak brahmad main ekaakaar ho gaye hai
 Of the 46 people honored with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Gulzar is definitely one of my most loved people
 unhone shabdon se hi apni roji-roti kamai, lekin sahi shabdon kaa chayan karnaa nahin bhuule
 For him, words are not just the humming of love, but also the weapon of war and the torch of peace
 unhone taumr vah kiya, jis kaam main ve sarvshereshth the
 Through our words touched our lives, showed us what we might not see, heard the echo of silence, made the magic felt and enriched our lives
 jab shabdon kii baat aati he, to nishchit hi gulzaar jaisaa koi nahin

 See the intelligence document approved in 2010, a list of six political parties from other countries has been made in America

 The US gave the NSA official permission to monitor these parties
 bijepi bhi inamen shaamil he
 According to information made public by Snowden on Monday, the NSA was granted espionage rights in 2010 under the controversial US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISS) of the US
 bataaya gaya he ki enese ko jo list saunpi gai he, usamen na keval chah raajnneetik partiyon, balki bharat sahit 193 deshon kii sarkaron kaa bhi naam he
 It also includes India
 snowden ne akhbaar ko die dastavejgauratlab he ki america kii neshnal security agency (NSA) ne in raajnneetik dalon or sanghathanon kii jasusi karne kii ijaajat maangi thi
 Documents related to this were made public on Monday by the American newspaper 'the Washington Post'

 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatra se purv desh main america netritv kii lokapriyata varsh 2008 ke mukaable kaaphi neeche chali gayi he
 People in India are deeply angry about the Obama administration's increase in professional visa fees and its policies on outsourcing
 gaoup pole dwaara kal jari kiye gaye taaja aankadon ke anusaar, america raashtrapati kii lokapriyata kaa graph varsh 2008 main 31 fisadi ke mukaable girakar varsh 2010 main 18 fisadi ho gaya he
 7 in contrast
 5 arab dollars kii sahaayta raashi sambandhi kairi lugaar burman vidheyak ko manjuuri die jane or bade paimaane par baadh raahat kaaryo main madad ke baad pakistan main america netritv kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua he jahaan yah varsh 2008 main das fisadi ke mukaable varsh 2010 main badhkar 18 fisadi tak pahunch gaya he
 Accelerating his campaign against outsourcing, Obama recently said that his administration would only provide tax benefits to companies that would create employment opportunities in the country
 yah ek aisa kadam he jo bade paimaane par bhartiya iti companiyon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Prior to Obama's visit to India in November, the Obama administration brought a controversial bill that increased the H1B and L1 visa fees
 yah kadam bharat ke 50 arab dollars se adhik ke iti udyog ko aghat pahunchane vaala mana ja rahaa he
 It can be said by coincidence that among the 18 Asian countries in which the Gallup survey was conducted, India and Pakistan have recorded the lowest popularity of American leadership
 pakistan main obama ko naapsand karne waalon kii sankhya 68 fisadi to bharat main 72 fisadi he
 Other countries in which the popularity rate of the American leadership has been low include Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Indonesia where half of the people surveyed did not express their opinion but who also expressed their opinion
 The number of those who showed a liking for the Obama administration was also considerable
 varsh 2008 ke baad se bharat, vietnam, nepal or indonesia main america netritv ko lekar anischitata jaahir karne vaale logon kii sankhya main bhi kaaphi ijapha hua he
 Gallup has said that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries to come under the survey where 68 and 54 percent respectively disliked the US leadership
 pichley kai saalon main in deshon main america netritv kii lokapriyata ghatati badhati rahi he
 Throughout the year, the United States and North Korea continued to scare the world by showing fear of war
 kai baar to tab aisa laga tha maano sach main parmaanu yuddh shuru ho jayega
 But then Trump and Kim Joan both calm down
 kim jone un to ab bhi shant he
 But America has become turbulent once again
 par is baar uske nishane par uttar korea nahin balki iran he
 Since Iran's move to kill American drones, the United States has been constantly looking for a chance to attack Iran
 duusari taraf iran ke tevar bhi sakht hai
 So the danger is that the war may not really start
 20 june 2019 kumobarak, iran13 karod america dollar yani kareeb 696 karod rupee kii keemat vaale maanavrahit global hoque MQ-4C truton nigaraanee drone irani hawaii kshetra main ghuskar jasusi kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 And then, without losing time, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard shot him down with a radar guided missile
 apane sabase modern or shaktishaalee drone ke maar giraae jane se america tilamila uthaa
 But before that the US would have made any threat against Iran
 irani revolutionari guard kii taraf se ek bayaan jari hua
 It was said on their behalf that "america does not take us lightly, we know how to protect our borders
" "iran kaa america ko munhtod javalmerica ko is baat kaa ilm to he ki maujuuda vakt main is tevar se uske khilaaf baat karne kii himmat rus or china ke baad iran main he to, magar wo uske is advance drone ko bhi maar giraayega jise bina radar gided missile ke nahin giraaya ja saktaa
 He did not expect this
 lihaaza america ne iran ko jawaab dene ke liye yuddh kii pehali niti apanaai or kaha ki uskaa drone antarrashtriya hawaii kshetra main tha naa ki irani hawaii kshetra main
 But Iran delayed this policy by releasing a video of its policy
 jisamen irani radar main america drone uski hawaii seemaa main pravesh karata hua saaf dikh rahaa he
 20 June 2019 evening 7
 45 baje, washington disi, americanmerica drone MQ-4C truton ke giraae jane ke kai ghante baad raashtrapati trump ke trivoter acount se ek twit kiya gaya
 "iran has made a big mistake
 '' trump kii is chetavanee or sakht lahaze se duniya samaj gai ki ab america iran ke khilaaf koi bada acshan lene ja rahaa he
 Rust can begin at any time
 magar jang ko taalane kii koshish karne ke bajaae
 The response to Trump's tweet from Iran came like this
 aaiye ham jang ke liye taiyaar hai
 After this tweet by US President Donald Trump, preparations started for the attack on Iran
 america raashtrapati ke daftar se hamale ke aadesh bhi de die gaye
 Late on 20 June 2019, the Gulf of omanamerica banned its planes from passing through Iran and the Gulf of Oman
 or apane yudhpot, ladaaku vimaan or jangi jahaaz iran par hamale ke liye oman kii khadi main tainaat kar die
 An attack could have started at any time
 magar tabhi washington se sandesh aayaa
 The plan of attack has been canceled
 kyonki raashtrapati trump ko unke salaahkaaron ne samajhaayaa ki iran par is vakt ye hamalaa ghaatak ho saktaa he
 Because on the basis of the violation of Iran's nuclear deal in 2015, the US was trying to put it in the dock and attack it
 use lekar is samjhaute main shaamil china, france, germany, rus, european union or britain khud america ke paale main nahin the
 Because these countries believe that Iran has followed every condition of the agreement
 aise main hamale ko lekar saudi arab or israel ko chhodkar baaki tamaam desh is masale par iran ke saath khadey dikhaai de rahe hai
 So sometimes Trump wants to attack Iran in any way with the excuse of the attack on oil tankers standing in the Gulf of Oman, or the killing of American drones
 darasal, iran par hamale ke liye ek taraf america par saudi arab or israel jaise deshon kaa dabaav he kyonki wo arab deshon main iran ke badhate dabadabe ko apane liye khatre ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 On the other hand, this war is also important for Trump because there are general elections early next year and Trump wants to take back the White House on the issue of nationalism in these elections
 or shaayad isiilie wo purv raashtrapati baraak obama ko is samjhaute ke liye zimmedaar tehra rahe hai or ise america ke liye behad khatarnaak bataa rahe hai
 However, in the meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin has stood in front of the US on this issue
 putin ne saaf kar diya he ki agar america ne iran par hamalaa kiya to aisi tabaahi machegi kii uski bharpai karnaa mushkil hoga
