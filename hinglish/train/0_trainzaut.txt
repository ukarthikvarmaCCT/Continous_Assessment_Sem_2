 Subramanian Swamy had raised the matter: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had taken up the matter in November last year and had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding the end of Rahul Gandhi's Indian citizenship and membership of Parliament
 swami ne daawa kiya tha ki rahul ne landan main ek privet company chalaane ke liye khud ko british naagarik (2003-2009) bataaya tha

 manishankar ayyar ne baaten to hansate-hansate hi kahi, lekin unke bayaan par nayaa bavaal khadaa ho gaya he
 At the same time, his statement has opened the inside of the Congress party
 manishankar ayyar ne congress ko sarkas kahkar ek nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 The party which was formed by Sir AO Hume 125 years ago has now become a circus
 ek aisa sarkas, jisamen log khub uchhalkud karte hai
 This Congress circus also has a ring master, jokers and other artists
 ring master to sabko pataa he, lekin is sarkas kaa joker or koun-koun kaisaa kalakaar he, ye pataa nahin he
 These things are being said because Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has described the party as a circus
 aisa sarkas, jise samajhane ke liye congress se judana padataa he
 Mani Shankar Iyer was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of Kitab 24 Akbar Road in Delhi
 manishakanr bolne par aae, to jubaan par lagaam lagaana hi bhul gaye
 Sayed such things, which raised the question of the democratic existence of Congress
 10 janpath par sonia gandhi rahati hai or 24 akbar road par congress kaa mukhyalay he, par 23 wellington road par koun rahata he? aapako bataa den ki 23 wellington road par rahete hai- sonia gandhi ke rajnatik salaahkaar ahamed patel
 In addition to the triangle in the Congress, Mani Shankar laughed many things, but opened the Congress's discord on everything
 manishankar pehle bhi do-took bolte rahe hai
 Now whether he did so intentionally or jokingly opened the Congress's bud, it is difficult to say

 No one knows when to change his life
 sabaki jindagi main aisa vakt aata he jab wo bahut acchhee sthiti main ho or achaanak jindagi kaa pahiyaa aise ghumta he ki unhen ek vakt kaa khaanaa bhi nahin mil paata he
 This is the time when a man pleads with others for help
 kai baar aisi paristhitiyon main hamaare parivaar madad ke liye aage aate hai or nahin to phir anjaan logon se saport lenaa padataa he
 a 59-year-old man who previously worked in a boot factory in Nottingham was going through very difficult circumstances in his life
 is shaks ke paas khaane ke liye kuch nahin tha or thand ke mausam vah kam se kam kapadon main rahane ko majaboor tha
 Seeing his problem, this man named William finally decided that he would put a notice outside his house and ask people to help him
 da mirar ke mutabik, wiliam ne apane ghar ke garden ke get par logon se madad maangate hue ek notice lagaaya
 In his notice, William wrote, "I have nothing to eat, no electricity in my house
" 
 
 agar aap meri kisi bhi tarah kii koi bhi madad kar paaen to main aapkaa abhaari rahoonga''
 After this, Craig Crawford, a Nottingham businessman, came forward to help William
 bataa den, craig har saal ''chrismas campan'' chalaata he or logon se khaanaa, khilone or furniture aadi daan karne kii maang karata he
 Craig Crawford lives just 10 minutes from William's house, and when he sees this notice, he decides to meet William
 craig crockerd ne bataaya, ''jab vah wiliam ke ghar pahunchaa to use vahaan baahar se zyada thand mahasoos hui
 He was sitting wearing only a coat, hat and gloves
 craig ne aage bataaya, ''wiliam ne pichley 4 dinon se thik se kuch nahin khaaya tha or bas bisakut ke sahare ji rahaa tha''
 Craig said, "if no one comes here by Monday, he would hardly have survived"
 craig ne bataaya, ''wiliam ke is notice ne uski jaan bachaa lee''
 Craig continued, "within a few hours i had raised a lot of food and money for William with the help of other people
" vah kaaphi vikat sthiti main tha''
 Craig told, "william had been collecting food for himself for a long time by selling his household goods but now he had nothing to sell
 is vajah se usne apane ghar ke baahar madad kaa notice lagaaya''
 Craig Crawford also asked people for donations to help William, so that he could once again stand on his feet
 or fasebuk ke jariye craig ne wiliam kii madad ke liye 2,500 pound (lagbhag 2
 35 lakhs) added Rs
 logon se mili madad ke baad wiliam ne kaha, ''maine kuch din pehle apane ghar ke daravaaje par notice yah soch kar lagaaya tha ki aate-jate jo bhi ise dekhegaa wo shaayad mujhe kuch khaane ko de degaa lekin aap sab se mili madad ke liye main aapako dhanyavad kahana chahta hum''

 china kii behad mahatvakankshi project 'van belt van road' par rajdhani beijing main ravivaar se shuru ho rahe belt and road forum (BRF) sammelan kaa bharat bahishkaar karegaa
 In an official statement released late Saturday, India has clearly stated that it cannot accept any project that violates sovereignty and territorial integrity
 china kii rajdhani main forum kii baithak shuru hone ke kuch ghante pehle sakht shabdon vaale bayaan main bharat ne kaha he ki sampark pahal is tarah kii honi chahie jo samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kaa sammaan kare
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said in a statement, guided by its principled stand on the matter, we urge China to participate in fruitful negotiations on its connectivity initiative One Belt One Road, later renamed Belt and Road Initiative 
 ham china kii taraf se sakaaratmak jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 "the international community is well aware of India's stand on the alleged sino-pakistan economic corridor being presented as an important project of BRI-OBOR," Bagle said
 koi bhi desh asipariyojna sweekaar nahin sakatajo samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta par uski mul chintaaon ko darkinar kare
 Explain that India has a strong objection to the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
 darasal sipiisi gilggit or pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pok) ke balatistan se hokar gujarata he
 India considers the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir, including pok, as its integral part
 sipiisi china kii vishisht belt and road inishiative (BRI) kii mahatvapurn pariyojna he or rajdhani beijing main do dinon tak chalane vaali baithak main is pariyojna ke pramukhataa se uthne kii sambhaavna he
 Significantly, 29 nations and government heads will participate in the BRF conference to be held in Beijing
 inamen pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif or roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin bhi shaamil honge, jabaki dakshin korea, france, germany or britain samet kai anya deshon ne is sammelan main shirkat karne ke liye mantristareey yaa aadhikarik shishtmandal niyukt kiye hai
 This is the result of heavy diplomatic lobbying by China, but other countries outside India have no objection to sovereignty with the initiative of One Belt, One Road
 yojana main CPEC ke mahatv ko dekhte hue, aisi ummid he ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif apane desh ke liye gemeanger is pahal ke mahatv ko rekhaankit karne main pramukh bhoomika nibhaayenge
 At present, it is the only project which is expected to give quick results
 vah sambhavat: sabase bade shishtmandal kaa netritv kar rahe hai, jisamen chaar mukhyamantri or paanch sangheey mantri hai

 Do the people of London and India know the pain of these people who are tuning in that this is not the London i knew
 soshal media kaa bogus rashtrawaad kisi mulk kaa aaina nahin hota
 Experts may not know that London, but the poor laborers of London may have known them
 bina pension or saste aspataal ke export ji sakate hai, aam log kaise ji lenge
 In India, mps, mlas, Prime Ministers and even the Chief Minister have pension but not the employee
 jis din log samajhenge us din ve kya karenge
 Tell the experts what they should do
 isliye landan vaale jaankaar sadame main hai
 Brother brothers like him are in shock in India
 jaise kisi ke naihar main chori ho gai ho
 Hey brother, when you know the country through TV and newspaper, you will know only that much you have known
 vahaan ke soshal media main bhi vahi sab jhalka jo media main chhalkaa tha
 All were bike goggles in the circus's death well
 ek hi baat ko koi survey main kah rahaa tha to koi dibet main 
 The comments yahaan tak to thik he
 Now that it has been classified, thousands of analyzes are being published on it
 itane angel se lekh chape hai ki main padhate padhate pareshaan hum
 Larger than the incident are the repositories of articles printed on it
 logon ko hi gariyaane kaa itnaa bada project maine kabhi nahin suna isliye main saare lekh padhanaa chahta hum
 For this i need three months time
 bhai logon ne itnaa likh diya he ki chhath puja tak ko time lag hi jayega
 But i will complete the dose of Brexit in three months
 isliye aap mere 'live aplication' par vichaar karen or avkaash pradaan karen
 Your 'remain' raveesh kumaar I'd like a three-month vacation
 main 'live' shabd kaa istamaal nahin kar rahaa hum varanaa aap samajhane lagenge ki main phobia or jhuthe prachaaron ke bahekaave main aa gaya hum
 Ever since Britain won the 'leave', people with 'remain' have been calling the 'leave' good
 'live' samarthakon ko kaankl or baankl samajha ja rahaa he
 That is why i have used the term holiday
 britain ne european union se alag hone kaa jo faisla liya he use brexit kaha ja rahaa he
 Why do i want a three month break? i have been trying to understand the world for many days that leaders are flying here with the old model plane, nothing is happening
 ulta kai tarah ke aarthik or kootnithik club ban gaye hai
 Now countries are also getting involved in the competition of taking contracts in such a way that i am afraid that they will not add Construction Limited in the name of the country
 zyaada nahin bas itnaa samaj aayaa he ki 2008 se in netaaon ne kitne tel phoonk diye, iske chakkar main tivi ke zariye khud mahaan or vishwa nayak ban gaye lekin aarthik halaat main sudhaar nahin hua
 The amazing thing is that no one wants to put a question mark on this economic system
 koi nahin bataa rahaa he ki aath saal ke prayaas ke baad arthvyavastha ke baagon main bahaar kyon nahin ai
 As a child, when i was a weak student, i used to carry all the books in the bag
 mere padosi ankal ne kaha ki kamazor vidhyaarthee kaa bastaa hameshaa baari rahata he
 The same situation is with these leaders
 kair is patr kaa maqasad avkaash maangana he
 It is not to receive the Nobel Prize by lecturing on the economy
 meerut, mujaffarnagar, sonipat ghoomte ghoomte bees saal guzar gaye to hindi ke is patrkaar ko global naagarik hone kii ichha jaagrit hui he
 i want to be free from all the experiences of North India accumulated within me
 kab tak har chunaav main ek hi baat jaanoonga or bataaungaa
 i felt that by moving towards new subjects and geography, see if the world is different there
 mujhe nai jaankariyaan romanchit bhi kar rahi thim
 Everything was going well that Brexit was done
 jis tarah se bhartiya media kaa gurutvkarshan bal dilli main hota he usee tarah se brit media kaa landan main hota he
 No one from India went there and tried to understand the changing society of Britain
 britain waalon ne bhi yahi kiya, logon se baat karne ke bajaae survey survey khilne lage
 The situation of the future media there is the same with the media here
 bharat main saare log indipentand, gardian, daily mail, telegraph, new yarker, ai tivi, bibisi, sienen ke zariye britain ko do din main samaj gaye hai or bharat ke akhabaaron main lekh likhane lage hai
 No Indian newspaper has been read since two days! jabaki brexit hone se pehle kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki kya hone vaala he
 If done, then the supporters of those who have media there have been garrisoned
 media kiske hit main nagarikon ke virodh main khadaa ho rahaa he
 Why don't you say that if someone becomes a graduate by taking a loan of forty-four lakh rupees, then there will be many others who will not become graduates
 jab garibon ko oxford nahin mila to ve kyon cambries kii tarah baat karenge
 Don't tell me why there are less educated people there
 kal agar modi fel ho jaaen to isamen matadaata kii kya galati he
 How is his decision wrong? usee tarah se bricsit ko vot karne vaale garib or kam padhe likhe matadaata kaise doshi he
 The media in London is saying that people have been misled
 are to aap log kya kar rahe the? kya aap raajnneetik corporate or media ke is khel ke khilaaf likh rahe the jiske khilaaf vahaan ke log hote ja rahe the
 The character of the media is also becoming like a cartel club
 duniya bhar main jis tarah se likhane vaale sakriy ho gaye hai usee tarah se soshal media par share karne vaale sakriy ho gaye hai
 Sometimes someone is pushing the article of Guardian and sometimes of Vox
com and Medium
 ham log vahaan kii media par apane yahaan kii media jitna hi bharosa karte hai
 Madia writes with closed eyes and we read with closed eyes

 He was serving the hopes of 'remain'
 ham us media ke vishleshan ko padhe ja rahe hai
 They are being read and then written in the newspapers here
 ab sab padhakar likhane lage hai ki main jis britain main jaagaa hum, wo vah britain nahin jise main jaanata tha
 Those who knew knew that there is no need to know new
 jin dalon ke bich ve shatal cork bane hue hai unki karatuuton par sawaal lagbhag band ho gaye hai
 Political parties are drinking a cocktail of 'cartels'

 Your 'remain' raveesh kumaar Well, the aim of this letter is to ask for leave
 arthvyavastha par lacture dekar nobel puraskaar praapt karnaa nahin he
 Twenty years have passed while wandering in Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Sonipat, then this Hindi journalist has awakened his desire to be a global citizen
 main apane bheetar sanchit uttar bharat ke tamaam anubhavon se azaad hona chahta hum
 Till when will i know and tell the same thing in every election
 laga ki nae nae vishyon or bhugol kii taraf kadam badha kar dekhen ki kya vahaan duniya kuch alag he
 New information was thrilling to me
 sab kuch thik thaak hi chal rahaa tha ki brexit ho gaya
 The way the gravitational force of the Indian media is in Delhi, the same way that the Brit media is in London
 bharat se kisi ne vahaan jaakar britain ke badalte samaaj ko samajhane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Britons did the same, instead of talking to people, they started playing survey surveys
 vahaan ke fatichar media kaa jo haal he vahi yahaan ke media kaa he
 In India, people have understood Britain in two days through Independent, Guardian, Daily Mail, Telegraph, New Yorker, i TV, BBC, CNN and have started writing articles in Indian newspapers
 do din se koi bhartiya akhbaar hi nahin pard rahaa he ! While no one knew what was going to happen before Brexit took place
 ho gaya to yahaan vahaan kaa media hone waalon ke samarthakon ko hi gariyaa rahaa he
 In whose interest is the media standing up against the citizens
 bolta kyon nahin ki chavalis lakh rupee kaa qarza lekar koi graduate banegaa to baaki kai log aise bhi honge jo graduate nahin banenge
 Why would the poor talk like Cambridges when they did not get Oxford
 bataao na bhai ki vahaan kam padhe likhe log kyon hai
 If Modi fails tomorrow then what is the fault of the voter in this? uskaa faisalaa kaise galat he
 In the same way, how is a poor and less educated voter who votes for the British is guilty
 landan kaa media kah rahaa he ki log bahekaave main aa gaye
 Hey so what were you guys doing? Were you writing against this game of political corporate and media against which people were becoming there? media kaa bhi charitra cartil club kii tarah hota ja rahaa he
 The way writers have become active around the world, the same way those who share on social media have become active
 kabhi koi gardian kaa lekh thel de rahaa he to kabhi wox dot com or medium kaa
 We trust the media there as much as our own media
 madia ankhen band kar likhata he or ham log ankhen band kar pard lete hai
 Sir, the media there did not know that the 'leave' was going to win
 wo 'rimen' kii ummiden paros rahaa tha
 We are reading the analysis of that media
 padhe ja rahe hai phir yahaan ke akhabaaron main likhe ja rahe hai
 Now everyone has started reading and writing that the UK that i have awakened is not the UK i knew
 jaanane waalon ne samajha tha ki nayaa jaanane kii zarurat nahin he
 Questions on the actions of the parties between which they remain shuttle corks have almost ceased
 raajnneetik dal 'cartil' kaa cocktail pi rahe hai
 One must see that the time has come for the end of parties over fifteen years of age worldwide
 inamen kuch bachaa nahin he
 The new leader and strong leader's tantrums are proving to be worthless
 jaankaar kulinon kii nishtha logon ke prati kam in dalon ke prati zyaada ho gai he
 Instead of calling the people there as sophistic and blind nationalist, they should be called rich and poor
 corporate kaa vistaar galat nahin he lekin janata ko bazarwaad kaa pahaada rataakar inhen sabsidi dena kaise thik he
 In India, the loan of millions of crores was taken away by the corporate, no one got angry
 iske baad bhi netaa log mahaan bane hue hai
 The tweetless Indian farmer is committing suicide and does not even have permanent teachers in government schools
 iske bina bhi jidipi taraqqi kar rahi he
 Sycophancy is at its peak
 to aap bataaiye ki jo is system se baahar he wo kya karen
 What the system gave him was that he used to cut bread and mango slices with a fork knife on the dinner table
 kya landan or bharat ke jaankaar in logon kii pidaa jaanate hai jo kapaar dhun rahe hai ki yah wo landan nahin jise main jaanata tha
 Bogus nationalism on social media is not a mirror of any country
 export nahin jaanate honge us landan ko lekin landan kaa garib mazdoor unako jaan gaya hoga
 Experts can live without pension and cheap hospital, how will common people live
 bharat main saansad vidhayak, pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri tak ko pension he lekin karmchaaree ko nahin
 The day people understand what they will do on that day
 export bataa den ki unhen kya karnaa chahie
 Therefore Londoners are shocked
 unheen ke jaise bhai bandhu bharat main sadame main hai
 Like someone has been stolen in Naihar
 are bhai tivi or akhbaar ke zariye jab desh ko janenge to itnaa hi janenge jo aap jaanate rahe hai
 There was also the same thing in the social media that was spilled in the media
 sab sarkas ke maut ke kuen main bike gogiyaan rahe the
 Some were saying the same thing in a survey and some in debates
 tippaniyan It is fine even ab bricsit ho gaya he to is par hazaron kii sankhya main vishleshan chap rahe hai
 Articles have been printed with so much angle that i am disturbed while reading
 ghatana se badi ghatana is par chape lekhon ke bhandar hai
 i have never heard such a big project to make people sing, so i want to read all the articles
 iske liye mujhe teen maheene kaa vakt chahie
 Brother people have written so much that it will take time till Chhath Puja
 par main teen maheene main brexit kaa dose puraa kar luungaa
 So, you can consider my 'leave Application' and provide a holiday

 The program of Holika Dahan is also unique in these areas

 Local people say that Holika Dahan is the first to be performed by the heirs of the Kakatiya dynasty even today in the village Madhapal, only after that the program of Holika Dahan starts at other places
 madhapal main holikaa dahan kii raat chote rath par savaar hokar rajpariwaar ke sadsy holikaa dahan kii parikrama bhi karte hai, jise dekhne ke liye hajaaron kii sankhya main vanavaasi ekatrit hote hai

 In an editorial in the party's mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray wrote that Sonia remarked that political parties were misusing Shivaji's name
 unhone kaha ki yadi marathi log shivaji maharaj kaa naam nahin japenge to kya unhen kwatrochi kaa naam japana chahie
 Thackeray has written that fighting for the rights of Marathi people has become a crime in the eyes of Shiv Sena opponents and the name of Shivaji is seen with narrow eyes in the Congress regime

 Regarding Petroleum Minister Murali Deora, Thackeray said that Deora is not as worried about the pride of Maharashtra as Mukesh Ambani
 bhartiya sena ne niyantran rekha par naushera sector main pakistani chaukiyon ko dhwast karne kaa video jari kar paak ko keval aainaa dikhaaya he
 There has been an argument that the Pakistani army will have to pay a heavy price for helping the terrorists and will have to answer in the international fraternity
 sawaal uthta he ki aakhir bharat sena ko pakistan ko sabooton kaa ye sample kyon dena padaa? aakhir kyon ye kahana padaa ki agar ghuspaith jari rahi to or bhi adhik sakriy karrwai hogi? in sawaalon kaa jawaab beete ek hafte main hui ghatnaon or sena ke oparations main chupa he
 After a 30-hour encounter in Naugam in the days of the terrorists' dangerous intentions, the army recovered such equipment from the slain terrorists which indicated that the terrorists had come prepared to carry out a major suicide attack

 BAT'17 will have to be controlled, the Indian Army responded to the firing coming from the Pakistani post on the midnight of 17-may
 is javaabi firing main pakistani sena kaa ek commando bhi maaraa gaya
 The question arises that what was the commando of the Special Operations Group of Pakistan Army doing at a post along the Line of Control? The Pak army uses these commandos for acts like barbaric bat action against Indian troops on the border
 khufia sutron se sena mukhyalay tak is baat kii bhi jaankaree pahunchi ki paak sena bat karrwai badhaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he or haji pir ke alaava bimbhar kaa ilaaka uske nishane par ho saktaa he

 pichley aath din se laapata bhartiya vaayu sena ke een-32 vimaan ke bare main pehali baar khabar ai he
 Although the initial news is not good
 kyonki khabar vimaan ke milane kii nahin balki laapata vimaan ke malbe ke kuch tukade dikhaai dene kii ai he
 a total of 13 people, including eight crew members were aboard the aircraft
 vaise aapako bataa den ki een 32 vimaan shuru se hi rahasyamayi rahaa he
 NN-32 has disappeared in the sky twice before
 or ajtak uskaa suraag nahin mila he
 25 March 1986 An AN-32 aircraft took off from Oman, Muscat to Jamnagar, Gujarat
 vimaan main 4 kru member or 3 paisanger savaar the
 But during the flight, that plane suddenly disappeared from the Arabian Sea
 jisaki kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 On 22 July 2016, an AN-32 aircraft also flew from Chennai to Port Blair
 us vimaan main 6 kru member or 23 paisanger savaar the
 But during a sudden flight the aircraft went missing over the Bay of Bengal
 use bahut talash kiya gaya
 But nothing was found
 3 june 2019assam ke jorhat se udakar china ke sarahadi ilaake arunachal pradesh ke menchuka ke liye bhartiya vayusena ke transport aircraft vimaan een-32 ne 3 june ko udaan bhari
 The aircraft had 8 crew members and 5 passengers
 magar udaan bharne ke kuch der baad hi een-32 kaa sampark atisi se tut gaya
 Neither the aircraft's location was found on the radar nor the Air Force could find any clue
 vimaan arunanchal pradesh main chini seemaa se sate ilaake se laapata hua tha
 Therefore, suspicion was also deepening on China
 magar bina kisi pukhta nattejey par pahunche bharat koi bayaan nahin dena chahta tha
 There could have been two reasons for the sudden disappearance of the aircraft
 yaa to ye kisi sajeesh kii ore ishaara kar rahaa tha yaa kisi phir kisi haadase kii taraf
 11 June 2019 After nearly 9 days of searching, AN-32 got a clue
 lekin jo khabar ai wo maayoos kar dene vaali thi
 The Indian Air Force said that 13 pieces of debris of the missing aircraft AN-32 along with 13 people were recovered
 malbe kaa ye hissaa arunachal pradesh ke siyang jile main mila
 However, the pilot and officials on board the aircraft are unlikely to survive
 magar airforce kii taraf se jari kiye gaye bayaan main kaha gaya he ki wo vimaan main savaar tamaam logon kii talash kar rahe hai

 So the answer is these dense forests

 So it was not easy to get a clue of the aircraft from these forests
 3 june 2019, dopaher 12
 An AN-32 flew from Jorhat airbase in Assam at 35 pm and the aircraft suddenly disappeared from radar from the Mechuka airfield area of arunachal Pradesh at around 1 pm
 arunachal kii menchuka air field kaa ye ilaaka chini seemaa se bilkul sata hua he
 No clue of AN-32 was found until several hours after the ATC lost contact and disappeared from Radar
 bhartiya vayusena ke vimaan een-32 main 8 kru member or 5 yatri savaar the
 That means a total of 13 people were on this plane
 lihaaza bhartiya vayusena een-32 ko dhund nikaalane main koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati thi
 The Air Force has deployed one Sukhoi-30, C-130 Special Ops aircraft, AN-32 aircraft, two Mi-17 helicopters and two Army AHL helicopters to search for AN-32 aircraft
 itnaa hi nahin vimaan kaa suraag dene waalon ko 5 lakh rupee dene kaa elaan bhi kiya gaya he
 But still the news of the Air Force aircraft AN-32 was not available
 iske alaava vayusena kii kai timen lagaataar radar se vimaan kii khoj main juty huin thi
 But there was no contact with the aircraft
 naa hi kisi ilaake main is vimaan kaa malba hi mil rahaa tha
 Then on the afternoon of June 11, Air Force Chopper MI17 was found to have debris of the missing AN-32 aircraft at an altitude of 12,000 feet
 jis jagah vimaan kaa malba mila he, wo siyang jile kaa tato gaanv he
 Which is 16 km from Lipo
 philhal airforce or local police kii kai timen jahaan malba dikhaa he, vahaan tak pahunchane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Air Force has refused to give a permanent commission to Wing Commander Pooja Thakur, who gave the Guard of Honor to US President Barack Obama

 Explain that Permanent Commission means to remain in service till retirement
 puja thakur ne court main airforce ke is ravaiye ko bhedbhaavpurn, pakshpatpurna, manamaana or betuka bataaya he
 PM Modi talked about empowering women in the Armed Forces Force
 duusari tarafraksha mantri ne bhi army main mahilaon kobadi bhoomika dene kaa paksh liya tha
 In such a situation, this move of the Air Force is being considered against women

 com / jbthhfv7oo— ANI UP (@aninewsup)march 9, 2017 i remember very well when our wedding date was final, then there was only one thing going on in my mind at that time
 kapade, gahane se zyada chintaa mujhe is baat kii thi ki kya mujhe offis se utani chuttee mil jaaegi jitani mujhe chahie
 
 
 There are a lot of events in the month of December, in such a situation, it was a task for me to ask for a month's leave and then meet again
 aamtaur par ladakiyon ko is dauraan kichan ko lekar tarah-tarah kii tension hoti he ki wo duusare ghar main kya pakaaengi, kaise pakaaengi
 
 
 Whereas i only had holiday tension
 na to mujhe gol rotiyon kii tension thi na hi chikan kari kii
 
 
 At that time my mind was only on holidays
 shaadi ke ek hafte baad maine offis jwoin kar liya
 i remember how much preparation i had to do before going to office that day
 ek acchhee dress chuni thi maine
 Then matching sandals and bags from him
 
 i knew that people would come to greet me and they would notice me
 maine us din bhi kichan main sirf do cap chaay hi banaayi thi or fatafat se kaam ke liye nikal gai thi
 i have been married for four years now and i feel no shame in saying that i am a domestically challenged woman
 haa, in kuch saalon main maine kuch aisi dishes jarur sikh lee hai jo paanch minute main ban jaati hai
 My pulse still gets watery and the bread making tension i have left the head of my med
 meraa ghar jagamagaataa to nahin he lekin ganda bhi nahin rahata
 
 
 But most of all i am happy
 vaaki khush hum
 But i laugh at the thought of those who judge a girl by her two acts
 pehla to wo kitni jaldi maa ban ja rahi he or doosraa ki wo kitni gol rotiyaan banaati he
 i fail on both these aspects
 par iskaa matlab ye bilkul nahin he ki main khud ko ek fail wif maanati hum
 
 
 Not even by mistake
 main ghar main aane vaale lagbhag har bill ko apane hasband ke saath share karti hum
 i talk with him wisely and meaningfully
 main internet se judi lagbhag har cheez ko use bataane main dekhne main uski madad karti hum, jisase uskaa time bachataa he
 Will i be called a bad wife despite doing so much? My mother was very tense when i got married
 wo pareshaan rahati thi ki mujhe to ghar kaa koi kaam aata nahin phir main guzar kaise karuungi
 But even after marriage, i did not know how to cook
 phir jab maine job se ek saal kaa brake liya to sabane mujhe kooking seekhney kii salaah di
 But i read books
 
 
 khub kitaaben padhi or bahut si jaankaree hasil kii
 After some time my husband became ill and people once again started pressuring me
 maine kuch had tak unki baat maani lekin us dauraan main ghanton apane hasband ke saath baithti thi
 Used to share positive thoughts with him
 mujhe laga ki isse unhen kaaphi phayda hua
 i do not understand why we put so much emphasis on women's domestic work
 main apane ghar ke liye roti pakaakar na sahi roti kamakar bhi ek acchhee patni ban sakati hum
 i am still not interested in learning cooking
 main uske liye maid rakh sakati hum or mere paas he
 i have only one life and i want to live it in my own way
 na ki kichan main khadey hokar aalu matar kii sabji banaate hue, paseene se tar-badar
 
 
 i am a domestically challenged wife and i am not in the mood to change it either
 main chaahati hum ki jab main marane vaali hum to main jindagi main gujarey in haseen lamhon ko yaad karun na ki ye ki maine kiske liye kya pakaaya
 Here is the thing about my husband, i would never have lived my life without being with him at all

 Following the Supreme Court's decision to change the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act (SC / ST Act), the way the Dalit community took to the streets earlier this month and expressed outrage, then a week later in Bihar, reservation opponents in some places Expressed anger over reservation, the matter was not yet removed from the headlines that Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan demanded reservation in the higher judiciary

 Apart from Ram Vilas Paswan, another Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha has also demanded reservation in the higher judiciary
 kai baar nahin mila daliton ko nyaaypasswan ne dhyaan dilaayaa ki mandal ayog ke faisle ko lekar court ne kah diya tha ki pramotion main aarakshan nahin ho saktaa jiske baad samvidhan main sanshodhan karnaa padaa
 He said that he respects the judiciary very much, but with this it is also true that many Barlaalits did not get justice
 udhaaharan ke taur par bihar ke bahucharchit lakshmanpur bathe hatyakand ke sabhi aaropee bari ho gaye jisamen 58 logon kaa katleam hua tha
 According to Paswan, it is a matter of concern that even at this time there is no dalitjaj in the Supreme Court and their number is very less in the High Court too
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan kii dhara 312 main is baat kaa praavdhaan he ki agar sarkaar chaahe to ol india jeudicial services kaa gathan karke uske jariye nyaayadhishon kii niyukti kar sakati he
 Paswan said that if this happens, people of the depressed classes will also be able to reach the judiciary in a transparent manner

 Like civil services, judicial commission will be the right way to appoint judges
 court ke faisle se logon main aakroshpaswan ne kaha ki jab keji balakrishnan supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish the tab unke upar kisi jati vishesh ko lekar koi aarope nahin laga
 Similarly, President Ramnath Kovind is the President of the entire country, but the feeling of satisfaction came in the minds of Dalits after his becoming President
 unhone kaha ki haal main supreme court ne anusuchit jati ko lekar jo faisla diya usase logon ke man main aakrosh he or sarkaar ne uske khilaaf punarvichaar yachika bhi daakhil kar di he
 Paswan said that we hope that the court will understand the people's displeasure and reconsider its decision
 lekin agar aisa nahin hota he to sarkaar adhyadesh lekar aegi or isaki taiyaari bhi ho rahi he

 centre main bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne ek baar phir sarkaar ko nishane par liya he
 Angered by the Modi government's U-turn on the Hurriyat and Kashmir issues, the Shiv Sena called it a chameleon and said that how and how often the chameleon changes color should be learned from the leaders
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main chape sampadakeey menshivsena ne kaha, 'hurriyat or kashmir maamle par centre sarkaar ne jaisi palati maari he waisi agar congress maarthi to use pakistan kaa agent tehra dete
 Parliament would have to stay indefinitely
 lekin centre sarkaar pakanishtha or hindustandrohi sabit ho chuke hurriyat ko apni god main baitaakar unako dulaar rahe hai
 "congress did not even do such an act", the article said that Modi used to say till yesterday that he would discuss other matters with Pakistan except Kashmir, now his role has changed as the Congress did not do the stupid work
 has done it
 shivasena ne kaha, 'hurriyat ab kashmir maamle par pakistan se charchaa karegaa aisi suvidha unhen de di he
 To be fair, the country should not be surprised at such a role

 The deaf who blew has become deaf
 hurriyat ke saath koun sa gupt qaraar hua he iskaa khulaasa hona chahie
 This is such a reversal as to consider the place of Ram temple tomorrow as Babri
 kal masood ajahar, lakhvi or daaud jaison se bhi kashmir par charchaa hogi

 purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur ne kerala ke alvensheri gaanv main apane paitruk awaas main dubai kii vyavsaayee sunanda pushkar ke saath malayalam parampara se byaah rachaa liya
 54-year-old Tharoor, a former Under Secretary General of the United Nations, is a Lok Sabha MP
 ravivaar subah saadhe aath baje se kuch pehle shubh muhoort main naadaswaram kii swar lahariyon ke bich hindu reeti rivaaj se tharur ne sunanda ke saath vivaah kiya
 On the occasion of the wedding, Tharoor wore a traditional Malayali kurta and mundu (lungi) while Sunanda (48 years), a resident of Kashmir, wore a white brocade "veshti and mundu" like Malayali brides
 vivaah se pehle tharur or sunanda ne bhagwaan or parivaar ke bade bujurgon kaa aashirwad liya
 Among those who gave blessings was 94-year-old nanny Jaishankari Amma of Tharoor
 vivaah ke baad tharur or sunanda ne ek-duusare ko phulon kii maala pahanaai
 According to the matrimonial tradition of the Nair families of Kerala, Tharoor gave 'pudva' (new garment) to Sunanda
 ‘‘olym’’ parv se purv yojit is vivaah samaaroh main gine chune logon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, lekin iske kawarej ke liye badi sankhya main mediakarmi maujuud the
 Among Sunanda's family, her father Colonel Pushkarnath Das and some relatives were present at the wedding ceremony

 kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne buudhvaar ko spasht kiya kivishvavidhyalay anudaay ayog (ujisi)ko samaapt karne kaa faisla nahin kiya gaya he
 The ministry issued a statement saying that the committee headed by former UGC chairman Hari Gautam has submitted its report to the higher education secretary, but it is yet to be investigated

 'according to the Ministry,' however, no decision has been taken and it is still necessary to understand and analyze the recommendation before making any decision

 Input from IANS assam ke rajyapal pi
 B
 acharya ne 21 november ko ek saarvajanik kaarykram main kaha ki ''hindustan hinduon kaa he
 The next day, stating that he had been quoted out of context, the former RSS pracharak went one step further and said that Muslims could go to Pakistan or Bangladesh if they felt unsafe in India
 usee din bijepi saansad yogi adityanath ne 17veen sadi ke ahom senapati lachit badfukan ko hindu mahanayake bataate hue unki prashansa kii, jinhone musalmaan akramanakariyon ko khaded diya tha—badfukan ne mughal badshaah aurangzeb kii sena ko brahmaputra main nausena kii ladaai main parrast kiya tha
 These statements are not incidental
 agle saal assam, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, puduccheri or kerala main chunaav hone vaale hai or assam akelaa aisa rajya he jahaan bijepi ke liye satta main aane kaa acha mauka he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party had won seven of the 14 highest seats so far, since then the bjp's stars have been shining continuously in the state
 assam kii 126 sadasyeey vidhansabha main do-tihaai bahumat paane ke liye party kaa 'mishan 84' is tathy par aadhaarit tha ki loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi 69 vidhansabha kshetron main aage thi
 The party's hopes were further heightened in February 2015 when the BJP won 38 of the 74 municipal boards and city committees
 assam ko lekar party kii gambhirtha saaf dikhaai de rahi he, kyonki bihar vidhansabha ke nattejey aane ke do hafte ke bheetar hi party alaakaman ne kendriya mantri sarbanand sonoval ko assam ikai kaa adhyaksh or chunaav prachaar samiti kaa pramukh niyukt kar diya or hemanth biswa sarama ko chunaav samiti kaa sanyojak bana diya gaya
 Indirectly presenting Sonowal as the Chief Ministerial candidate is an indication that the party does not want to repeat the Bihar and Delhi election mistake of not putting forward the local face
 lekin vah dhruvikaran kii ranneeti ek baar phir aajamaane par amada he
 The reasoning behind this is clear
 pichley saal jari 2011 kii janaganana ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki rajya main musalmaan aabaadi 34 pratishat ho gai he, jo jammu-kashmir ke baad sabase zyada he
 The reason for this growing population is alleged to be illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi Muslims
 isane hinduon main yah dar paidaa kar diya he ki aane vaale dinon main musalamaanon kii sankhya unase zyada ho jaaegi
 Says political critic Dilip Chandan, "bangladeshi infiltration is an emotional issue for the people of Assam
 ye pravasi mukhya rup se musalmaan hai, isliye bijepi ke liye dhruvikaran kaa agenda aasaan ho gaya he
 The rise of this fear is also the rise of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF)
 yah party 2005 main bani thi, jiske netaa moulana badaruddin ajmal ko bangladeshi sharnaarthiyon ke hiton kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 The AIUDF became the second largest party in Assam in the 2011 assembly elections with 18 seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main vah teen siten jitkar congress kii siton ke baraabar aa gai thi, jabaki 2009 main use sirf ek seat mili thi
 Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who mocked the AIUDF by saying "who is this Badruddin who is now", now wants to tie up with Ajmal before the elections to take on the BJP
 or jo party congress or eiudief ko ek saath dekhne ke liye sabase zyada bekaraar he, vah he bijepi
 "no Hindu in Assam wants Ajmal to have any kind of stake in the government," says a senior Assam BJP leader
 ''darasal, bijepi or eiudief ek-duusare se phayda uthaanaa chaah rahe hai
 a AIUDF leader told India Today that the communal statements of BJP leaders would help the party unify Muslim votes
 lekin sonoval ke netritv main bijepi ke liye sarkaar chalaanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 One reason for this is that the 53-year-old Sonowal may not get widespread acceptance among non-assamese
 chandan kehete hai, ''ab tak unki raajnneeti sthaneey asmi bhaawanaaon ke irdagird gumti rahi he
 In 1999, Sonowal joined the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and won the Lok Sabha election from Dibrugarh in 2004
 2005 main supreme court main lambii kanoonee ladaai jeetne or vivaadit avaidh pravasi (tribunel kaa faisla) kanoon, 1983, jise aksar bangladeshiyon ke avaidh pravaas kii dhaal mana jaataa tha, ko nirast karaane ke kaaran unhen ek nayak ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 But he lost the 2009 general election and joined the BJP in 2011
 lakhimpur se 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav jeetne ke baavjood rajya bijepi ke kai netaa unhen baahar kaa aadmi maanate hai
 a member of the bjp's election committee says, "why did he lose the election in 2009 even after being told as a hero?" He has not yet proved his ability as a leader
 ''assam kii janata main ise lekar kaaphi rosh he ki modi sarkaar ne bangladesh ke saath jameen kii adla-badla kii
 The state BJP also opposed this
 janata sarkaar ke is aashwaasan se bhi naaraaz he ki hindu bangladeshiyon ko naagarikta di jaaegi
 a senior BJP leader says that the party may take a few steps in a hurry to regain its lost land, including the central government's six OBC communities in Assam — Moran, Mutak, Tai Ahom, Koch Rajbongshis, Sutiya and 36 The announcement includes the addition of the Scheduled Tribes to the tea-area tribes
 in samudaayon ko janajati kaa darja milane par janajatiyon kii kul sankhya assam kii aabaadi main 40 pratishat se zyada ho jaaegi
 This will make 80 seats reserved for sts in the 126-seat assembly
 isse eiudief jaisi partiyaan haashie par chali jaaengi
 It is ironic that the biggest challenge for the BJP seems to be the number due to which the party is assuming that the polarization agenda will be helpful in winning the state elections
 rajya main 53 siten aisi hai, jinamein 25 pratishat se zyada musalmaan aabaadi he or unamem se 39 main 35 pratishat muslim hai
 With Congress and AIUDF joining hands, it will be almost impossible for BJP to win in these areas
 assam main congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''koi aupchaarik gathbandhan hanikaarak sabit ho saktaa he, kyonki isse hindu vot hamaare khilaaf ekajute ho sakate hai
 "it is an indication that the Congress is trying for informal, alliances with the AIUDF
" grih mantralay ne congress adhyaksharahul gandhike us bayaan kaa khandan kiya he jisamen unhone daawa kiya tha ki SPG ke ek adhikari ne unase kaha ki modi sarkaar kii taraf se SPG main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) dwaara chune gaye adhikariyon kii bhartee karne kaa dabaav he
 The Home Ministry has said in its statement that Rahul Gandhi had commented at an event on 22 September that the SPG chief appointed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to step down because he refused to accept the list of SPG officials elected by the RSS

 mantralay ne kaha he ki is maamle kii puri chaanbin ke baad sawaalon ke ghere main aae SPG ke purv nideshak vivek shrivastav ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki rahul gandhi se SPG chhodane ke masale par unki kabhi bhi koi baat hui thi
 It is worth mentioning that at a conference of academics held in Delhi on 22 September, Rahul Gandhi had said that when Modi came to power in 2014, he chose a person who was the head of SPG, who was forced to resign shortly after
 rahul ne kaha ki SPG ke us adhikari ne apni majaburi saajha karte hue kaha tha ki use sangh ke logon kii suchi thamai gai or unako bhartee karne ko kaha gaya he
 Refuting the claim of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, it has been said on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs that SPG is a professional body which takes the Prime Minister, former Prime Minister and other families whose safety responsibility is given to them seriously

 For this, he chose the path of suicide
 padhein
 
 
 Britney Maynord decides the day of her deathbritney had earlier informed the world about her decision by issuing a video message, after which the ongoing controversy over the right to death caught on
 is maheene kii shuruyaat main britaini tab surkhiyon main ai jab unhone apana video jari kiya
 Through this video, he threatened suicide
 yah video soshal media par khub charchaa main rahaa or lakhon web yugers ne dekha
 Britney said in her message, 'good Boy to all dear friends and families, today i have decided to choose death with self-respect, this terrible brain cancer has taken away a lot
 'unhone aage likhaa, 'yah duniya bahut khubasurat he, mere teacher or doston ne mujhe bahut kuch diya he
 i always found a helping hand near me
 alavida
 Spread positive energy and carry it forward
 'janvari maheene main menord ko jeene ke liye chah maheene mili the or unhen bataaya gaya tha ki khatarnaak cancer kii vajah se unki maut bahut dardanaak hogi
 During this time, Brittany was thinking of the first child with her husband Dan Diaz, but they changed their decision
 diaj ke saath shaadi ke baad hi menord ko sir dard kii lagaataar shikaayatein hone lagi
 The two then decided to move from California to Oregon
 haalanki guuruuvaar ko britaini ne ek video jari karke bataaya tha ki pehle se sunishchit maut se saakshaatkaar main thodi der ho sakati he
 But it was too late, Britney's story is making headlines all over the world
 america kii pipul magazine ne britaini ko pichley saptaah apane cover pej par jagah di
 During recent weeks and months, Britney keeps making a bucket list of what she wants to do before she dies
 isamen grand canyon kii yatra bhi shaamil thi
 Since the year 1977, 750 people have chosen death for themselves under the Death with Dignity Act of Oregon
 
 
 
 Eventually, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced the names of its candidates from the Amethi and Rae Bareli parliamentary constituencies for the Lok Sabha elections 2014
 
 
 amethi seat se tivi kalakaar or bhaajapa kii rajyasabha saansad smriti irani congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko chunauti dengi, jabaki raibareli seat par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa muqabla karne ke liye ajay agarwal kaa naam tay kiya gaya he
 
 
 On the other hand, the Congress has not yet announced the name of its candidate against Narendra Modi in Benaras, while the Congress has fielded a strong candidate former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to contest against Arun Jaitley in Amritsar seat of Punjab
 
 
 
 chunaavon main sheersh netaaon ke khilaaf majboot ummidavaar utaarna koi nai baat nahin he, or aisa kai baar ho chukaa he
 
 
 There is also a strategy behind this that the biggest leader of the party should be surrounded in his constituency, so that he does not get time for campaigning in other areas
 
 
 kai baar aisa hua he ki sheersh netaa ko munh kii khaani padi he or chunaav ke baad ke saare raajnneetik sameekaran dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 
 
 In the Lok Sabha elections held after the Emergency, Rajnarayan defeated the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from Rae Bareli
 
 
 is tarah unhone varsh 1971 main hui apni haar kaa badla bhi chukaa liya tha
 
 
 Significantly, on the plea of rajnarayan filed against this defeat, the Allahabad High Court imposed a six-year ban on the election of Indira Gandhi from Rae Bareli on 12 June 1975, invalidating her election, and subsequent events led to Indira Gandhi imposed emergency in the country
 
 
 pichley saal dilli main arvind kejariwal ne jis tarah se shila dikshit ko haraaya, usase bhi rajanarayan kii yaaden tazaa ho gai thim
 
 
 Similarly, in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, Madhavrao Scindia had fielded from Gwalior to challenge Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 
 
 dilachasp baat yah thi ki congress ne vaajapeyi ke khilaaf sindhiya kaa naam bilkul aakhri vakt par ghoshit kar bhaajapa ko chakma diya tha, or is chunaav main sindhiya ne baari maton se vaajapeyi ko haraaya tha or 'jayant killer' kehalaae, or is jeet se party main bhi sindhiya kaa kad bahut ooncha ho gaya
 
 
 In 1999, Congress President Sonia Gandhi also tried to surround the BJP in a similar manner, and it was decided to field Sushma Swaraj from Bellary seat in Karnataka overnight
 
 
 kanonkan kisi ko isaki khabar nahin hui
 
 
 The Congress had never lost this seat since independence
 
 
 sushamaa ne maidan main utarkar kannada main chunaav prachaar kiya, or vah sonia gandhi se haar gayi
 
 
 But with just 13 days of campaigning, he received three lakh 58 thousand votes and got everyone's attention
 
 
 baharhaal, in paimaanon se dekha jaae to amethi main rahul ke mukaable smriti irani or raibareli main sonia gandhi ke khilaaf ajay agarwal kisi bhi surat main bade naam nahin kahe ja sakate
 
 
 The BJP tried to field Uma Bharti in Rae Bareli, but Uma was not ready for it
 
 
 bhaajapa main unhen jhaansi or raibareli donon siton se chunaav ladaane par bhi vichaar hua, lekin baad main tay hua ki modi ke alaava kisi or netaa ke do siton or khaastaur se ek hi rajya kii do siton se ladane se galat sandesh jayega, isliye ajay agarwal ko tikat diya gaya, jo supreme court ke vakil hai
 
 
 Ajay Aggarwal has filed pils in cases like Bofors, CWG, Telgi and Taj Corridor, while Tejatrar Smriti Irani is considered close to Narendra Modi in the party
 
 
 tivi serial 'kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi' main 'tulsi' kii bhoomika adaa karne se ghar-ghar main mashhoor huin smriti kii lokapriyata ko bhaajapa ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bhunaane kii koshish kii thi, or tab unhen dilli main chandani chowk main kapil sibbal ke khilaaf maidan main utaara gaya tha, lekin smriti haar gayi thim or baad main unhen gujarat se rajyasabha main bheja gaya
 
 
 Political experts believe that the BJP has not fielded heavy candidates against rahul-sonia
 
 
 shaayad is ummid main ki congress bhi banaras main aisa hi kare
 
 
 But politics is the field where neither established beliefs work, nor prevailing principles
 
 
 tarkash kaa antim tir virdohi ko dharashayi karne ke liye hi istemaal hota he
 
 
 Will have to see what Congress does
 
 
 sibar city gurugram main namaaj ata karne ko lekar jila prashasan kii pareshaaniyaan kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 For the past few days, the conversation between the people of Hinduist organization and Muslim organization was going on continuously
 kai daur kii meetingon ke baad jila prashasan ne muslim samaaj ko 9 chinhit jagahon par namaaz padhane ke liye kaha he lekin is baat ko lekar muslim samaaj naakhush he
 According to Haji Shahzad Khan of Muslim society, we have been offering Namaz peacefully in 100 places all over Gurugram, but now due to the order of the administration, there are problems
 vahiin sanyukt hindu sanghathan ke sanyojak mahavir bharadwaj kii maane to jila prashasan ne ramadan ko lekar aurajumme kii namazko lekar tamaam sanghathanon se sahyog maanga tha or ek gyaapan bhi jila prashasan ko saunpa gaya tha
 This memorandum states that the distance of Namazis from all religious places should be about 2 to 5 kilometers
 kahin bhi agar pehle se hi masjid he or us masjid ke 2 kilometre ke daayre main kisi bhi sthaan par namaaz padhane kii anumati na di jaae
 Let me tell you that for the last two weeks, right-wing organizations have been trying to 'obstruct' the Namaz in Jume, alleging that some people are trying to grab land
 police ne bataaya ki pichley do hafton main wazirabad, atul kataaria chowk, sibar park, bakhtawar chowk or south city ilaakon main namaaj padhane se roka gaya
 Now protesting organizations have demanded not to allow Namaz in the open within 2 km radius of religious places
 unhone kaha, jab aap 13-14 saal antarrashtriya cricket khelte hai to vah str barkaraar rakhana mushkil hota he
 Especially with my body, but i have worked hard in the last two to three years after recovery

 Uttar Pradesh STF has arrested four people and disclosed the fatal attack on the BJP leader in Ghaziabad

 His mobile exposed the entire plot of attack on Teotia
 is maamle kaa ek aaropee abhi bhi faraar he
 Which is being searched aaropee ke phone kholaa rajbijepi netaa or property ke dhandhe se jude tevatiya par hamale ke baad is maamle kii jaanch ko jimmaa upi estf ko diya gaya tha
 When the STF arrested the four accused, Nishant was also among them
 uskaa mobile phone bhi estf ne baraamad kiya
 Mobile investigation revealed that the mobile has an auto call recorder
 jab estf ne usamen ricard sari baatcheet suni to maamla khulkar saamne aa gaya
 There was a record in the phone, the attack was complete, conspiracy: On the day of the incident, there was a record in the mobile about the planning of the attack

 This is her biggest mistake
 nishanth kaa mobile phone estf ke liye phydemand sabit hua
 According to STF sources, Suresh Divan Singh, a resident of Mehrauli village in Ghaziabad, was posted as a constable in Delhi Police, according to STF sources
 1999 main unki hatya kar di gai thi
 Manish and Manoj, sons of Divan Singh, were convinced that the murder was carried out by Brijpal, but due to the influence, no case was filed against Brijpal
 bataa den kii brijpal tevatiya bhi mahrauli gaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 The STF found that Brijpal had enmity with the family of Suresh Divan Singh over his land besides his murder
 suresh divaan singh kii hatya ke baad uskaa betaa manish or bhatija manoj badale kii aag main sulag rahe the
 And finally after 17 years, both of them made such a plan, the whole Uttar Pradesh was shaken
 ek-47, eke-56 or 9mem jaise hathiyaaron se brijpal tevatiya par hamalaa kiya gaya
 The attackers Rahul Tyagi, Jitendra, Ram Singh and Nishant were arrested
 estf ko nishanth ke mobile se ricarding mili
 The recording revealed the plot of the entire attack
 ab estf or police is baat kii chaanbin kar rahi he ki tevatiya kii hatya ke liye ye giroh ghaatak hathiyaar kahaan se lekar aayaa tha

 Greg Chappell was once the coach of India but he has now poisoned not only the Indian cricket team but also the Indian culture
 unka kahana he ki bhartiya team achche netritvkarta paidaa nahin kar sakate kyonki bhartiya vyavastha main sabhi faisle mata pita, schuli shikshak or coach karte hai
 Chappell said, 'indian culture is very different
 yah team kii samskruti nahin hoti he
 He lacks leaders in the team
 choti umr se unke mata pita sabhi faisle karte hai
 Their school teachers make all their decisions and their coaches make their decisions
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bharat main is tarah kii samskruti he ki aap koi apana sir uthaakar baat karata he to koi aap par baras padegaa
 So they learn by lowering their head and do not take responsibility
 ’crickinfo ke anusaar chapel ne apni kitaab ‘fyres focus’ ke prachaar kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, ‘pomes(angrej) ne vastav main unhen sir nicha karnaa sikhaaya tha
 If someone was deemed responsible, he was punished, so the Indians learned to refrain from taking responsibility
 isliye kisi bhi faisle kii jimmedaari lene se pehle ve usase bachane ko praathamikta dete hai
 Chappell said that Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni seems to be an exception but it seems that he too has become a victim of this system
 bhartiya team ke 2005 se 2007 tak coach rahe chapel ne kaha ki bahut adhik cricket kaa dhoni par asar dikhne laga he
 He said, 'but on seeing him in this tour
 
 i did not talk to him nor did i meet him, but seeing only his gestures on the field, i did not feel that this is the same MS Dhoni that i know
 main samajhataa hum ki bhartiya cricket kaa boj us par baari pad rahaa he
 The former Australian captain also said that during the recent tour of Australia, Indians did not show interest in Test cricket
 chapel kaa iske saath hi maananaa he ki virendra sahvaag kii captain banane kii mahatvakanksha se bhi team ko nuksaan hua
 He said, 'sehwag feels that he should have become the captain after (anil) Kumble, so some differences arose there
 ’ The Aam Aadmi Party government has approved the decision to install CCTV in cluster and DTC buses in Delhi
 dilli cabinet se manjuuri milane ke baad nirbhaya fund se 140 karod rupee kii laagat se 6 hajaar 350 cluster or DTC bason main sisitivi camere lagaae jaaenge
 Let us tell you that the Aam Aadmi Party had promised to install CCTV cameras in DTC buses during the 2015 assembly election campaign
 is vaade ke chalate hi sarkaar ne isko manjuuri di he
 Explain that there is a huge shortage of buses in the country's capital
 ditisi 2010 se ek bhi bas nahin kharid pai he, kyonki tender ke dauraan koi company ditisi kii sharton par bas dene ke liye taiyaar hi nahin hui
 In the name of women safety, the Center will be proposed to take funds from Nirbhaya Fund for installing CCTV in DTC buses
 isse pehle 2016 main payalat project ke taur par ditisi bason main sisitivi lagaae gaye the
 DTC will be operated through a control room
 3 CCTV cameras will be installed in every bus
 isamen ek acha feechar ye he, ki koi bhi krime agar bas main hota he to ek painic batan saath main diya jayega
 Live streaming will start in the control room as soon as you press the panic button
 jis bas se painic batan dabaaya jayega us bas kii live pikchar control room main dekh sakate hai
 Apart from this, the location of the bus will immediately reach PCR and local police station through GPS
 ditisi kaa ek control room he lekin sisitivi lagane ke faisle ke baad parivahan vibhaag ek nayaa control room seoup karegaa
 There is a continuous discussion with the Delhi Police for the coordination
 200 sisitivi ke payalat project ke dauraan krime kii ghatana ke baad dilli police ne kai baar control room se recording lee he
 The new cctvs being installed will be maintained by a private company through tender for the next 5 years
 pichley dhai saal main 2 baar bason ke tender nikaale gaye lekinmentanence kii shart kii vajah se donon badi company tataor ashok-lilend ne hissaa nahi liya
 Both companies were raising rates too much on the condition of maintenance, so the tenders failed
 haal hi main ditisi board ne 1000 based kharidne ko anumati di he
 Also, DTC will now maintain these buses themselves
 mentanence ke liye agar zyada staff kii niyukti kerani padi to ditisi khud karegaa
 Many decisions were taken after the Nirbhaya scandal, at the time of the proposal, the cost of the project was about Rs 103 crore and the fund was to be taken from 'nirbhaya'
 2014 main ditisi bason main sisitivi lagane ke liye 3 karod 91 lakh rupye kharch hue the
 Let us tell you that more than 4 thousand buses of DTC had electronic machines and wifi
 ye tamaam faisle desh kii rajdhani main hue nirbhaya cond ke baad liye gaye the
