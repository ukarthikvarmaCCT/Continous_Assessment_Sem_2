main khud ko usase rilate kar paata tha
 i also liked her and lived alone
 main uski condishan ko samaj paa rahaa tha
 She used to tell me how she was getting depressed due to not getting work, that she had no good relations with her family, that her father had abandoned her and that she had raised herself on her own
 usne mujhe bataaya tha ki uske eks bwoyfrends use gaaliyaan dete the
 Not only this, she told me that when she was 14 years old, a man raped her in London
 nafisa ne mujhe ye bhi bataaya tha ki ek samay aisi haalat thi ki use din main bas ek time khaanaa naseeb hota tha
 After listening to all this my love for him was further increased
 nafisa ko apane parivaar se or pyaar kii saath hi aas paas ke logon se rispect kii jarurat thi
 i could not do that
 haalanki ek 21 saal kaa ladkaa jo bhi kar saktaa tha usase zyada hi maine kiya
 She used to cry every night
 main jabase uski jindagi main aayaa tha wo akeli nahin rah sakati thi
 She used to come to my house often
 nafisa ke ghar par aane se papa ko tha aitraaj
 
 
 Initially due to Nafisa's sexy image, Papa did not like her coming in this way, but when i introduced him to him, he had no problem coming to Nafisa's house
 apni film ke liye main subah 8 baje se shaam ko 8 baje tak kai class atend karata tha, lekin use mere upar puraa vishwaas nahin tha haalanki mujhe us par puraa bharosa tha
 i used to tell my head to him sometimes and used to assure him that i am in class
 ek samay aisa aa gaya tha ki wo mere saath meri class main bhi jaaya karti thi, mujhe isse bhi koi dikkat nahin thi
 i tried my best to explain
 
 
 ek din main iske saath baitha or kaha, 'nafisa, tum jaanati ho ki main ek bhartiya ladkaa hum
 i have seen a lot in my family
 main tumhaara dhyaan rakhane kii puri koshish kar rahaa hum
 You cry in front of me every day
 main tumse 4 saal chota hum
 i love you despite everything you told me about yourself
 tum meraa vishwaas karnaa shuru karo
 i love you more than my parents and sister
 agar main tumse 3 din naa miluun to meraa pyaar tumhaare liye sirf badhegaa
 Nafisa had tried to commit suicide earlier also
 
 
 7 maheene main 3 raaton ko chhodkar wo har raat roi he
 We went to Goa once to celebrate her and my birthday
 uske saath depressant kii problem thi or wo counselling bhi kara chuki thi
 She told me that earlier she had tried to hang him
 main abhi bhi uski maa kii izzat karata hum
 i wish i could ask him if he really feels that i did something wrong with Nafisa
 nafisa kii pregnancy se bekhbar the suraj
 
 
 One day he told me, 'suraj, i am not getting periods
 kya ham doctor ke paas chal sakate hai?' ham doctor ke paas gaye or usne nafisa ko ek goli di or kaha ki isse sab sahi ho jayega
 We went back home and everything was normal
 jab police ne uske family doctor se poocha ki kya aborshan ke samay main vahaan tha to doctor ne manaa kar diya
 The police asked me and i said, 'sir, we had a physical relationship
 usne mujhe apni pregnancy ke bare main nahin bataaya tha
 If it was proved that it was mine, i would have adopted it
 varanaa ye meraa nahin he, is bare main main kuch nahin kah saktaa
 'why did the break-up happen? a month before Nafisa's death, she came to my house crying at 8 am
 usne mujhase kaha, 'meraa meri maa se jhagada hua he
 'he had bruises on his arm
 maine use apane dost karan ke saath choda or use bataae bina uski maa se milane gaya
 i asked her mother, 'auntie, have you had a fight with Nafisa? Have you killed him? ' They told me, 'no, i never killed my daughter
 ' maine nafisa kii maa se kaha ki main un donon ke bich main aane vaala koi nahin lekin bas unka bataanaa chahta hum ki unki beti kii haalat thik nahin he or use medical assistance or unki madad kii jarurat he
 i was trying my best to help him
 uski maa ne mujhe kaha tha, 'betaa, wo aisa bas atension paane ke liye karti he
 Thank you for coming here
 uske eks bwoyfrends bhi use chhodkar chale gaye the lekin wo khudakushi nahin karegi
 She has been doing this since the age of 11, 'I told Nafisa that i met her mother
 wo apane ghar gai or uski maa ke number se mere paas ek messej aayaa, jisamen likhaa tha, 'suraj, main nahin chaahati ki tum meri beti ke saath raho
 'I did not want any distance between Nafisa and her mother because of me
 iske alaava main nafisa ke roj ke rone se tang aa chukaa tha
 i told him that i would not be able to handle all this anymore and cut short the conversation with him
 uski khudakushi se 20 din pehle hamaare bich baatcheet bahut kam ho gai thi
 The last thing between Suraj and Nafisa
 
 
 usne somvaar (3 june) ko khudakushi se pehle shanivaar (1 june) ko mujhe kol kiya tha or kaha tha, 'main hyderabad ja rahi hum
 i am getting a film there
 main usase pehle ravivaar tumhaare saath bitaana chaahati hum
 'I told him it's okay, but i didn't want to suffer the pain of separation again, so this Sunday will be our last Sunday together
 maine somvaar subah use ek buke bheja
 On which was written, 'all the best
 ' usne mujhe somvaar kii shaam phir kol kiya or kaha, 'main tumse milanaa chaahati hum
 'I said,' i can't meet you
 ' or maine use messej kiya, 'nafisa, aisa nahin karte hai
 'and i turned off my phone
 wo aakhri baar tha jab maine usase baat kii thi
 Papa had told about the suicide of Nafisa
 
 
 2 ghante baad mere papa ne mujhe uske suicide ke bare main bataaya
 Papa cried more than me when Nafisa died
 unhen lag rahaa tha ki wo uski or madad kar sakate the
 He was aware of all the problems of Nafisa
 uski maut mere liye 'shock' nahin thi lekin uski building main ghuste hi mujhe ronaa aa gaya tha, main vahiin use lene jaaya karata tha
 i still love Nafisa
 
 
 main abhi bhi use yaad karata hum
 Everything in my house reminds him
 wo andar or baahar donon tarah se khubasurat thi
 He should have waited for the good things in his life to come
 usne sahi nahin kiya ki wo mujhe is tarah se chhodkar chali gai
 i could not help it
 meri jindagi main ek badlaav aayaa he ki meraa apane maa-baap or bahan ke liye pyaar or bad gaya he
 i have always been a quiet person, but now if i had 5 percent anger in me, then that too is over
 mujhe isse koi dikkat nahin ki meraa naam uske saath jindagi bhar joda jayega
 i still love her today

 upi ke barabanki main police hiraasat main ek yuvak kii sandigdh maut ho gai
 Angry villagers attacked the police station in the area
 police karmiyon kii pitayee kii or chaowkee main aag laga di

 The villagers alleged that the policemen have also forcibly performed the body of the young man's body after the post-mortem

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav spoke to Rahul Kanwal, Managing Editor of Headlines Today, on Aaj Tak channel's Sidhi Baat program
 baatcheet ke pramukh ansh
 One year of your government is over
 mukhyamantri mahoday, aap apane vaayade ko puraa karne main naakaam rahe
 There are some achievements like Kanya Dhan, Unemployment Allowance, which our government has fulfilled
 laptop bhi tha, jisaki shuruyaat ham kar chuke hai
 As far as law and order is concerned, it seems that efforts are being made to hide the achievements of the government
 or vaise bhi jab party satta main aati he to akeli hoti he or koi bhi ghatana badha-chadhaakar bataai or dikhaai jaati he
 This is not a conspiracy
 main aankadon ko saamne rakhata hum
 After you became the Chief Minister, there have been 27 riots in Uttar Pradesh in the last one year, 380 people have been kidnapping, 814 raped, 2,257 murdered
 mujhe yaad he jab chunaav chal rahe the, tab bahujan samaaj party janata ke bich aankade rakh rahi thi or aankade is baat ke rakhe ja rahe the ki uttar pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha baaki pradeshon se behatar he
 He also gave the example of Delhi and other states and the same figures are coming to you
 aap 27 dangon kii baat kar rahe hai
 These riots did not take place
 aap jab sachai main jaaenge or janenge ki jo log pakade gaye hai, ve kis raajnneetik dal se taalluk rakhte hai
 Do some comparison
 2011 main jab mayawati kii sarkaar thi, 326 rape hue
 In 2012, there were 1,036 cases in your government
 ye hakeekat he ki log mayawati ke raaj main zyada mahfuj mahasoos karte the
 i have said this in the Legislative Assembly that no FIR was registered in the previous government
 main khud thane main soya, us samay ke netaa pratipaksh, jo aaj lok nirmaan mantri hai, ve thane main soe
 The FIR was not registered even after the sitting of the Samajwadi Party people for two consecutive days
 yah sachai he
 Your relative is Abhinav Gupta, who slapped his university teacher and the teacher's mistake that he talked about not attending the exams when the attendance was low
 jab teacher police stesan exiar darj karwaane gai to us vakt inspector vijaimal singh yadav bhaag gaye, yah jaanakar ki abhinav mulaayam singh or akhilesh ke parivaar se hai
 How can i register his FIR? aapako itani hi jaankaree he
 The teacher had a fight with Abhinav and she went to register an FIR
 main teacher se mila tha
 And the teacher's father met me in the assembly itself
 maine khud unki shikaayat suni thi
 Full action is taken
 abhinav ko uniwarsity se nikaala he or jo karrwai kar sakate the, vah kii he
 But see the fear of the policeman
 aap dekhen to exiar darj hui he or ye nirdesh die ki sarkaar kii taraf se exiar maamle main koi dhilaai nahin hogi
 The problem is from inside
 association of democratic riforms ke aankade dikhaate hai ki 48 main se 26 mantri aise hai jin par koi na koi criminal cese he aise log aapane rakhe hai, jo galat massej de rahe hai
 Among the ministers who are prosecuted, many are those who have political cases
 amarmani kaa udhaaharan detaa hum
 To say that he is in jail, his meeting goes on in jail
 darbar lagata he
 Whenever you want to sit in an SUV from jail, do not sit in a prison car
 unhen keval aspataal jane ke liye parmishan di thi
 The laxity has been acted upon
 aisa aarope he ki uttar pradesh ek he lekin vahaan mukhyamantri anek hai
 You are the Chief Minister, but some believe that you are only a mask
 asli cheharaa ajam khan, shivpal yadav or aapke pitaaji hai
 This question has been asked many times
 koi bhi sarkaar tabhi chal sakati he, jab mukhyamantri ek ho
 It is not possible to have so many achievements of the government within a year, to work better than any state, until the decision is not one
 aapako yah mahasoos hota he ki aap kaman aapke paas hai par aapke pitaaji kai baar aapke mantriyon kii aalochana kar dete hai
 Your father considers you a failure
 dekhie, kisi kii aalochana karnaa yaa kisi ko sudharne ke liye kahana alag baat he
 And if they get this information through someone and they tell this, then there is nothing wrong in that
 aap benny prasad verma ko kaaphi achche se jaanate hai
 He gave a statement against Mulayam Singh that he has had a criminal life, he has a relationship with terrorists, should be prepared to go to Tihar
 ve congress se kamishan lete hai
 i should not say anything to them by age, but whatever they said is wrong
 or uskaa virodh unki khud kii party kii taraf se bhi aayaa he
 People in his party have admitted that his language was not good
 lekin tab aap sabhi kah rahe the ki benny kaa istipha ho varanaa ham sarkaar kaa saath chhod denge
 But at the last moment, the deal was done with the Congress
 benny to ab bhi hai
 Senior government leaders accepted and i even condemned the statements of many leaders that the words were bad
 sarkaar se diemke alag ho gai
 But Mayawati and Mulayam's jugalbandi will always save the government
 bada ajeeb rishta he
 Fight so much on the streets, yet help Congress
 yah congress kii khubi he ki vah donon dalon, jo upi main ladate hai, unheen kaa sahyog le paati he
 The quality of the Congress or the CBI
 main samajhataa hum ki congress kii khubi he
 According to you, elections will be held in april-may 2014 or in november-october
 jab bhi chunaav ho, samaajawaadee party taiyaar he
 Better for Samajwadi Party if elections are held in April
 agar pehle ho jaaen to bhi taiyaar hai
 On one side, Narendra Modi's face is visible
 aapako lagata he ki bijepi ko vah sarkaar dilaa sakate hai?tivi or gujarat main unke naam kii charchaa ho rahi he
 There is no discussion on land in Uttar Pradesh
 aap khaufjada hai kyonki charchaa he ki modi lakhanu se bhi chunaav lard sakate hai
 i said that the discussion is happening only on TV and the ticket gets fixed through TV
 aapkaa anumaan kya he? chunaav hue to kisi sarkaar banegeeham apana kah sakate hai ki samaajawaadee party kii bhoomika ahm hogi
 Samajwadi Party will have more number in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar kiski banegi, yah kah paanaa mushkil he
 Sometimes it seems that the third force may also be ready
 aapke pita ne aapako mukhyamantri banaaya
 Now it will be your effort to make him Prime Minister
 piem vahi ban saktaa he, jiske paas sankhya ho, dalon kaa samarthan ho, lekin jahaan tak netaji kii baat he, samaajawaadee party kii, rashtriya netritv kii to meri jimmedaari banati he ki samaajawaadee party zyada siton ke saath jitkar aae
 What will be your priorities next year? What to do? Uttar Pradesh is the largest state in the country
 samaajawaadee party kii praathamikta yah hogi ki tamaam chizon main vikaas ho, sadaken behatar bane
 Better education, health and better treatment
 jis tarah nivesh or udyog lagane kaa maahaul bana he, vah bhi samaajawaadee party kii niti he

 bhaajapa ke piem pad ke pratyaashee or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or unke kareebi amit shah par ek mahila kii jasusi ke aaropon kii jaanch rashtriya mahila ayog nahin karaayega
 National Women's Commission chief Mamta Sharma has said that it will not be done when the woman's father has written a letter urging that both she and the daughter do not want the matter to be investigated
 vahiin, congressi netaa or kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha he ki is maamle kii jaanch hone chahie, bhale hi pita iske liye taiyaar kyon na hon
 In this case, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said that when the girl's father has said such a thing, then there is no question of investigation
 party ne yah bhi kaha ki ladki ko saraksha di gai thi
 Commission member Nirmala Samant Prabhavalkar told PTI that there was considerable ambiguity in the letter allegedly written by the woman's father
 isamen koi email pataa, telephone yaa mobile number nahin he
 We have written a letter to the postal address given in the letter and asked the woman's father to clarify whether he has written this letter or not
 unhone kaha ki ayog ne mahila ke pita ke jawaab ke liye saat din kaa samay diya he
 He said that many facts are missing from the letter
 hamane mahila ke pita se hamen is maamle ke sambandh main or jaankariyaan dene ke liye kaha he
 The matter is serious, so the letter was given last night by an anonymous person to a security guard who came to us today

 The relationship we share is a language that doesn’t exist
 
 except for in our eyes
 
 and toes okay and mayb xxrep 4 e our knees
 
 So anyway
 
 Sir
 
 You’re the sweetest artichoke the pudding of Naples has seen cause eventually we all just have to bobble our way through the heavens of sisterhood and I’m glad we’ve had the little nook of heaven with cats and aloo fry and tons of london!

 The Bharatiya Janata Party's hopes of holding simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the country have received a setback from the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog kaa kahana he ki desh main itane vivipat hi nahin hai ki 11 rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav or desh main loksabhaa chunaav ek saath karavaaen jaaen
 According to Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat, if assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections of 11 states are to be held simultaneously, then it will have to be decided within the next one or two months
 kyonki iske liye kaaphi badi maatra main nai vivipat mashine order kerani hongi
 Apart from this, it has also been said by the Election Commission that Lok Sabha elections cannot be held even with the assembly elections of 4 states to be held at the end of the year
 is bich bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi ek desh-ek chunaav par bayaan diya he
 He says that this is not possible in the present situation

 According to BJP sources, there will be no need for any constitutional amendment or any major amendment in electoral rules
 lekin ab chunaav ayog ke jawaab ke baad in atakalon par sawalia nishaan khadaa ho gaya he

 kabhi laal jhande vaale vampanthi dalon kaa garh rahe bengal kaa rang teji se badal rahaa he
 The rise of the BJP, now called saffron, can be clearly seen in the state
 rajya kii raajnneeti main is badlaav kii gati saal 2016 ke chunaavon ke baad tej hui he
 The situation is that once the supporters of the Left parties and their workers have started going to the BJP
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bengal main bijepi chauthe sthaan par thi
 But the same party took second place in the by-elections in Cooch Behar after this, leaving behind both Congress and Left candidates
 pichley sabhi chunaavon main chaahe vah upachunaav ho yaa panchayat ke chunaav, har jagah rajya main bijepi duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 It was clear from the by-election in Cooch Behar that voters are now choosing BJP over Congress or Left parties in the TMC option
 pichley kuch chunaavon main yah baat or saaf ho gai
 The BJP saw almost the same increase in the percentage of votes received as the cpi-m's vote declined
 agar chunavi aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya jaae, to yah dikhegaa ki vam dalon ko vot karne vaale matadaataaon kaa bahut kam hissaa tiemasi kii taraf gaya he, jabaki iskaa bada hissaa bijepi kii taraf chalaa gaya he
 The CPI had trained its supporters in such a way that they keep opposing TMC since the nineties
 isliye unke man main hameshaa tiemasi kii chhavi ek virdohi party kii hi rahi
 After being ousted from power in 2011, the CPI (M) was unable to maintain its base and its leaders only continued to build their political base
 lambey samay tak satta main rahane ke dauraan makapa ne sanghathanaatmak dhaancha majboot karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi or prashasan par hi nirbhar rahe
 Due to this, his base was shattered after going out of power
 rajya main badal rahe raajnneetik rang kii vajah se sabhitrade unionke sin board kaa rang bhi badalane laga he
 The few very strong CPI-M supporters who are left are being attacked and their political masters are unable to defend them
 to is hataash samooh ne aakhirkaar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 Saffron has now become the color of the main opposition in Bengal
 rajya kii raajnneeti kaa khel badalane laga he
 TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has also understood who is the biggest threat to her
 ve centre kii bijepi sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye agle saal 19 janvari ko ek vishaal raily karengi
 The BJP has also decided to rally in the same brigade parade ground where Mamta Banerjee's rally will take place
 rajya main ab congress or vam dalon main koi dam nahin bachaa he

 sincerely) jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne algaavvaadi netamsarat aalamki rihaai par kendriya grih mantralay ko teesri baar report bheji he
 After the dissatisfaction of the Center, it is said that the Mufti government has sent this detailed report
 sutron ke mutabik, isse pehle centre sarkaar maamle main dobaaraa bheji gai report se bhi santusht nahin thi
 Therefore, the Center had sought some further clarification about this
 jaankaree ke mutabik, centre ne mufti sarkaar se puure ghatnakram or isaki paristhitiyon ke bare main or jaankaree maangi he
 The case of Masrat Kiraihai is also becoming troublesome for the Modi government at the Center
 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki sarkaar algaavvaadi netaa masarat alam kii rihaai par jammu-kashmir sarkaar kii ore se di gai safai se santusht nahin he
 The Center then sought a new report on the matter from the Jammu and Kashmir government, after which the Jammu and Kashmir government had submitted a second report to the Union Home Ministry in the Masrat case, showing speed
 gauratlab he ki pradesh sarkaar ne masarat alam ko shanivaar 8 march ko reeha kar diya tha
 He was lodged in Baramulla Jail
 is rihaai ke baad vipakshi dalon ne na sirf centre ko nishane par liya balki narendra modi kii rashtravaadi vichaardhaara par bhi sawaal uthne lage
 In the Lok Sabha also, the Masrat matter resonated, after which PM Modi replied in the Lok Sabha, saying that with the release of Alam, he mixes his voice in the resentment of the country
 modi ne bataaya ki is maamle main jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne centre sarkaar se koi salaah nahin lee thi
 The Government of India had no information about this
 modi ne sadan main kaha, 'hamen koi deshbhakti na sikhaaen
 This is the anger of the whole country, not of any party
 aatankwaad or algaavvaad main antar nahin he
 No such action will be accepted

 Congress legislators got angry over NCP in a meeting convened in Mumbai to decide the election strategy

Based on the accumulated strength of congress-ncp, only 3 candidates can win in the elections for 10 seats of Maharashtra Legislative Council
 in 3 siton main se 2 siton par ensipi daawa kar rahi he
 Despite being a smaller party than the Congress on the basis of numbers, the NCP is firm on its claim, leading to anger over this claim in the Maharashtra Congress
 ensipi ke pradesh adhyaksh sunil tatakare yah elaan kar chuke hai ki donon dal yah chunaav ek saath ladenge

 In this meeting chaired by Maharashtra Pradesh Congress President Ashok Chavan, the mlas were heard raising the question that why should any Congressman vote for the NCP candidate? maharashtra vidhaan parishad kii 10 siton ke liye hone vaale chunaav main congress-ensipi ke ekatrit sankhyabal ke aadhaar par keval 3 ummidavaar jeet sakate hai
 Out of these 3 seats, NCP is claiming 2 seats

 NCP state president Sunil Tatkare has announced that the two parties will contest this election together

 Based on the accumulated strength of congress-ncp, only 3 candidates can win in the elections for 10 seats of Maharashtra Legislative Council

 Despite being a smaller party than the Congress on the basis of numbers, the NCP is firm on its claim, leading to anger over this claim in the Maharashtra Congress

 maharashtra kii 34 din puraani bijepi sarkaar kaa shuukravaar ko pehla vistaar hoga
 Apart from the 10 Shiv Sena ministers joining the government, 10 BJP ministers will also take oath in the Legislative Complex today
 shivasena cote se ekanath scindia, ramdaas kadam or subhash desai, divakar ravate or deepak saavant cabinet mantri pad kii shapath lenge
 Apart from this, five mlas of the party will also be made Ministers of State
 inamen rabindra wiker, sanjay rathod, vijay shivatare, deepak kesakar or rajesh kshirsagar shaamil hai
 Significantly, in the Fadnavis government, the Shiv Sena also wanted the post of Deputy Chief Minister, but this demand was not met
 BJP kii sharton par shaamil hogi shivasenisse pehle saajha press conference main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or shivasena ke subhash desai ne sulah kaa elaan kiya
 Both announced to join Shiv Sena KBJP government
 
 During this, Chief Minister Fadnavis said that we have been together for 25 years and the alliance of the two parties has been based on ideology
 ham saath main loksabhaa chunaav lade
 We fought the assembly elections separately, but both parties got more votes than Congress and NCP
 unhone kaha ki maharashtra kii janata chaahati he ki bijepi or shivasena saath aaen
 He informed that a new committee will be formed which will decide on the seat sharing in the upcoming BMC elections
 haalanki sutron ne bataaya ki uddhav kii party centre main ek cabinet or ek rajyamantri kaa pad or chaahati he

 shivasena kii centre main atirikt mantri pad kii maang ko maharashtra main manachaahe pad na milane kii bharpai kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The Fadnavis cabinet, which was sworn in as chief minister on October 31, has 8 cabinet and two ministers of state

 The leader said, our claim remains at the center
 ham ummid karte hai ki kuch hoga
 Now who is Shraddha's crow? Remember that before the Maharashtra elections, the old alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena was broken
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ne bijepi ke liye 'shraadh ke kauwe' jaise talkh shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 During the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called Shiv Sena as 'haftavasuli Party' and NCP as 'naturally Corrupt Party'
 lekin sadan main fadanvis sarkaar ne ensipi ke samarthan se 'vivaadit' vishwaas mat hasil kar liya
 The Shiv Sena termed this trust vote as 'fake' and there was a lot of uproar in front of the Governor's car
 lekin donon partiyon ke bich kuch 'ucchstareey' baithkon ke baad bijepi or shivasena ke bich sab kuch thik bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is probably the first time that the major opposition party of a state is going to directly join the government
 shivasena ko grih, awaas, rajasav or urja jaise bade vibhaag nahin milenge
 They can be replaced by departments like water conservation, industry and PWD
 shivasena grih vibhaag chaahati thi, lekin use grih rajya mantri kaa pad mil saktaa he
 In wholesale mandis, onion prices have risen nearly twice in the last 10 days
 10 din pehle jo pyaaj 1600 rupye prati quintal bik rahaa tha wo 2900 rupye prati quintal tak chadh gaya
 On Tuesday, however, the price of onion declined marginally from Rs 100 to Rs 200 per quintal
 pyaaj ke daam chadhane kaa asar khudara bazaar main dekhne ko ye mila ki pyaaj 40-50 rupye kilo tak bik rahaa he
 On Monday, onion touched a price of Rs 2800 per quintal in Nashik
 lekin mangalvaar ko maang kam hone kii vajah se thokmandi main pyaaj 2000 rupye se 2600 rupye prati quintal bikate dekha gaya
 Onion arrivals were good in all the mandis including Lasalgaon on Tuesday
 lekin zyada maang nahin hone kii vajah se daamon main kami ai
 Onion trader Sanjay Pardeshi, who is associated with Nashik Krishi Mandi, believes that this happened due to lack of demand
 lekin bharat ke dakshini hisse se aane vaala nayaa pyaaj is baar deree se aayega
 The onion crop has deteriorated due to rain there
 aise main 15 din tak bazaar main aisi sthiti bani rahegi
 In the wholesale market, the rate of interest is up to Rs 25 per kg, then by coming into the retail market it becomes Rs 40-50 per kg
 lekin aise halaat me bhi pyaaj ugane vaale kisaan khush nahin he
 Actually, it costs Rs 10 to 15 per kg to grow one kg of onion
 iske alaava usne paanch-chah maheene tak pyaaj ko store bhi kiya
 Stored onions have also been damaged due to unseasonal rains
 nasik ke sataana taluka ke kisaanon kaa kahana he ki shahar main khudara bazaar main pyaaj ke daam mahange ho jate hai to sarkaar par daam giraane ke liye dabaav bananaa shuru ho jaataa he
 But why everyone remains silent when the farmer had to sell onions for 1 rupee a kg
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is saal pyaaj kii nai fasal ek maheenaa deree se aegi
 Till then, the stored interest will fill the farmer's stomach
 maukey kaa phayda uthaane ke liye bichauliye sabase zyada taak main rahete hai
 They sell their stocked onion by increasing the price of onion
 pune ke thok bazaar main 20 rupye prati kilo se 29 rupye prati kilo chadh gaya tha
 One to two rupees have come down on Tuesday
 pune main acchhee quality kaa pyaaj 26 se 27 rupye kilo bik rahaa he
 Traders said that due to rain, onion crop has been damaged in the entire state due to which onion prices started increasing
 nagar jile ke ek kisaan vinayak kaa kahana tha kipyaaj kaa daam2700 rupye quital pahunchane se wo khush he kyonki use intjaar karne kaa phayda mila
 His profit increased due to increase in prices
 pune main vyapaariyon ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki kaise thok market main 2700 rupye prati quintal bikne vaala pyaaj shaharon main khudara market tak pahunchate 4000 rupye prati kilo ho jaataa he
 Actually Rs 2700 per kg at wholesale price adds Rs 360 per quintal transport
 phir isamen kamishan or levi ke 250 rupye prati quintal or judate hai
 The cost of distribution in every city is Rs 300 per quintal
 is tarah ye 3610 rupye quintal ho jaataa he
 The retail trader adds his profit at Rs 400 per quintal
 is tarah dilli jaise mahanagaron tak aate aate pyaaj graahakon tak kshetra ke hisaab se 40 rupye prati kilo tak bikne lagata he

 ''hamen is dar ko badha-chadhaakar pesh nahin karnaa chahie, balki in ghatnaon kaa upyog apni galatiyon ko sweekaar karne main karnaa chahie
 The problem in Western society is that it is so sophisticated that it is unable to accept the earthquake buried below
 ham is myne main laabh kii sthiti main hai ki khule taur par bhedbhaavpurn samaaj hone kii vajah se hamaare paas apni galatiyon se seekhney or unhen sudhaarney kii kshamta he
 On the other hand, while women scientists around the world shouted out on Twitter against Hunt's remarks, eight Nobel laureates supported Hunt
 hunt ko uniwarsity of landan main unke pad se hataa diya gaya
 But despite this controversy, the challenges of the Indian landscape remain largely unheard of
 kahaan he maamle kii jadhar mahila vaigyanik ko pataa hota he ki vetan-bhatte ke aankade main vruddhi bhale hi bada saamaajik sanketak ho, lekin vah mahilaon ke liye banaae gaye khaake main nitant alag myne rakhata he
 The National Committee on Women's Education expressed its first concern about women in the region in the 1959 Durgabai Deshmukh Committee report
 uske baad panchavarshiya yojanaon ne vikaas ke najariye se mahilaon ko dekha
 Several private studies have pointed out discrimination against women in science, including Rajendra Prasad Jaiswal in 1993, Karol Mukhopadhyay in 1994 and Susan Samoor in 1998

 In 2013, the National Science Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) included gender equality as the stated goals for the first time
 aankadon ke aadhaar par dekhen to vigyaan main mahilaon kii sankhya naganya nahin he
 a 2004 study by the Indian Academy of Sciences (INSA) found that women accounted for more than one-third of the total science degrees, but were only 15-20 percent of the regular faculty
 ienese kii follow-ap report, 2010 main ling sambandhi samanta baraabar he, jisamen kaha gaya he, ''bharat main har chaar main se ek vigyaani mahila he par unamem se zyaadaatar vigyaan ke nichle str par hi kaayam hai
 In early 2015, Sujatha Venkatesh of Humboldt University, Berlin, in the journal Transcience, wrote on the nature of social equality and cultural discrimination
 unhone bhartiya vigyaan main mahilaon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav ko ek to padanukram chantni ke rup main vargeekrut kiya, yani 'li hote pipe' ke rup main yaa varishthata badaae par mahilaon ke usamen se baahar ho jane ke taur par; or duusare kshaitij sambandhi pruthakkaran ke rup main, yani kuch khaas kshetron se mahilaon kii puri tarah gaiyr-maujuudagi ke rup main
 Her study also underlined that there has been a historic increase in the registration of women in the fields of pure science, 7 in 1950-51
 1 fisadi se badhkar 2009 main 40 fisadi tak
 This number is 43 percent in masters courses and 37 percent in phd
 vigyaan main degree hasil karne vaali mahilaon kii sankhya 1950-51 se lekar 1980-81 main tiguni ho gai
 But this number does not appear to be changing in professional work

 Aruna Dattatreyan, who received a Raman Research Fellowship and a biophysicist at the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), said in a 2014 compilation of women scientists in Lilavati's Daughters (edited by Ram Ramaswamy and Rohini Godbole), "humble and no woman It is expected not to question
 jab mahilaon ko padhgaye or kaam karne kii ijaajat milti bhi he to bhi un par kuch bhoomikaayen to purush thope hi dete hai
 They often act as a hindrance
 ''dattatreyan vigyaan ke kshetra main apane tike rahane kaa shrey apane pati ko detii hai jo khud chemist hai or jinhone bacchon ko bada karne main puri bhagidaari nibhaai
 She says, "I feel that the first few years in a scientist's career are the most important, they often fall behind because of the traditional role of producing children expecting women
" isamen mili aazaadee ne mujhe vaigyanik ke rup main paripakv hone main madad di
 "sujatha Venkatesh divides this discrimination against women into specific factors — the dominance of men in decision-making committees, a male-centric environment that prioritizes individual achievements over the place of institutional work; Abundance of male scientists in international level activities against whom women are engaged only in 'invisible' academic reading and observation; Informal networks and factional importance and discriminatory decisions in resource allocation and promotion
 iity-dilli main chemical fijicist or 2009 main shanti swaroop bhatnagar award jeetne vaali charusita chakravarti sabhi vaigyanik gatividhiyon main mitra samooh prakruti ko rekhaankit karti hai, ''agar aap kisi vajah se prabhavi rup se khud ko vaigyanik samudaay ke bheetar samyojit nahin kar paati hai to aap utane taqatvar tareeke se vichaaron ko paidaa nahin kar paaengi
 You will not be able to put them in front of you effectively and your effect will be reduced automatically
 chunki aapako zyada asarkaari nahin mana jayega isliye netritv kii bhoomika main aapaki daavedaari bhi kam ho jaaegi
 "in this context, the 'old Boys Club' separates women from the tasks which are necessary for knowledge participation and opportunity
" 2010 main shanti swaroop bhatnagar award jeetne vaali or tata institute of fundamental research main neuroscientist shubha tole un baithkon ko yaad karti hai jinamein unhen apni baat puri karne kii bhi ijaajat nahin milti thi
 Tole recalls how he was not included in many panels due to being 'over-ambitious' and 'aggressive' even though these things are considered virtuous for a male scientist
 tiiefaar main maths kii professor or 2004 main shanti swaroop bhatnagar award jeetne vaali sujatha ramdorai kahati hai ki ve us tarah ke pratyaksh ling sabandhi bhedbhaav se to bachi raheen jiskaa saamana baakiyon ko karnaa padataa he
 She explains that the Old Boys Club's gift is 'bagging and mutual appreciation', its effect is very serious
 ek shanti swaroop bhatnagar award vijeta ne bataaya ki is award ne unki jindagi badal di kyonki vah milane se pehle unhen to apni pregentation puraa karne kaa mauka bhi nahin diya jaataa tha
 Eventually, he started sending his work abroad, where he was taken seriously and as a result he was recognized in his country after that as well
 in sthitiyon main mahilaon ke liye vigyaan ek vaikalpik pasand ban jaataa he
 According to the 2010 INSA-IAS report, 14 of the women coming into science research

 5 percent
 mahilaon main 46
 8 percent work 40-60 hours a week while 66 in men
 5 fisadi isse kam ghanton ke liye kaam karte hai
 Similarly, only 19 percent of male scientists are wives, while 40 percent of women scientists' husbands are also in the same profession
 jab koi varisht ho jaataa he to chijen thodi aasaan ho jaati hai, tole kahati hai, aanshik rup se isliye ki ling sambandhi bhedbhaav se saamanjas baitaane kii jarurat kam ho jaati he
 She says, "unfortunately discrimination continues to prevail among the younger generation, but now more and more women recognize her when they come forward and there are very few who accept her silently
" ''bhartiya vigyaan main mahilaayein is abhas se bachanaa chaahati hai ki unhen kisi madad yaa aarakshan kii jarurat he
 Instead they expect the pressures of being a woman to be better understood
 purushon se miltaa sahyogkai mahila vigyaani maanati hai ki bhedbhaav ke baavjood samarthan bhi purush padanukram ke bheetar se hi miltaa he
 Venkatesh has pointed out in his study that almost all women in Indian science give credit to their fathers for arousing interest in science and advancing it, or for helping in the upbringing of children and helping them change places

 While Janata Dal (united) has started a 'word return campaign' on the statement, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Chief Minister Sushil Modi said that political DNA is examined by the public, not the doctor

 The comments unhone aage kaha, "janata nitish se unke mukhyamantritv kaal ke 25 maheenon kaa hisaab maang rahi he, lekin asli mudde se dhyaan hataane ke liye ve diene kaa mudda uthaa rahe hai

 anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki sapa sabase badi party ke rup main ubharegi lekin yah anumaan sapa netaaon ko bhi nahin tha ki vah 220 ke aankade ko paar karegi

 He said, "on the issue of law and order, we had to clean the public during the entire election, but we assure the public that strict action will be taken against the person who breaks the law in the SP government
 'akhilesh ne kaha, 'na to kisi hathi kii murti ko chhedaa jayega or na hi mukhyamantri mayawati kii kisi murti ko todaa jayega
 Our government will not take action under the spirit of revenge
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha, 'agar parks or smarakon kii khaali padi jagah main shikshan santhaan yaa aspataal khul jaaen to isse logon ko phayda hoga
 On the question of who will become the chief minister, Akhilesh said, "the whole party wants that the leader (mulayam) should become the chief minister, so he will become the same

 In a conversation with reporters in New Delhi, Rahul said, 'I fought, so this responsibility is mine
 hamane acchhee ladaai ladi lekin parinaam achche nahin rahe
 'he said,' i promised the people of Uttar Pradesh that i will be seen with the poor and on the streets
 meraa kaam jari rahegaa
 My efforts will continue to strengthen the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 rahul ne party ke niraashajanak pradarshan ke kaarnon par kaha ki is bare main tatkaal kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 'one or two reasons are very clear
 congress kii pradesh main buniyaad kamjor he
 Until we fix it, weakness will persist
 ' unhone kaha, 'logon kaa mood sapa ke paksh main tha, jo hamaare liye acha nahin he or uttar pradesh kii janata ke liye bhi acha nahin he

 gadakari ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'uttar pradesh main do dalon ke bich voton kaa dhruvikaran ho gaya
 There was an atmosphere against the BSP, which the SP succeeded in taking advantage of

 On this platform, he informs his policy decisions, executive orders
 trump twitor par duniya main sabase zyada foloar rakhane vaale netaaon main se ek he
 According to media reports, President Donald Trump's idea of not inviting these big companies in the social media sector may be the reason behind this, according to which the two platforms distort the views of Conservatives or Republicans
 fasebuk or twitor jaisi diggaj companiyon ke bina koi soshal media sammelan kii kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa, lekin apane plateform par republican party ke vichaaron kaa sammaan nahin karne ke liye trump baar-baar in companiyon par hamalaa kar chuke hai
 In his last meeting with Twitter's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jack Dorsey, Trump asked Dorsey how the number of followers on the microblogging platform, in particular, was declining
 white house ne june main is sammelan kii ghoshnaa kii thi or kaha tha ki ye sammelan duniya ke digital leaders ko ek plateform par laane par maujuuda chunautiyon or sambhaavnaaon par charchaa karne ke liye ek shandaar manch hoga
 The White House has not yet made public the names of the companies that will be attending the conference
 bataa den ki trump fasebuk or twitor se itane khafa he ki kuch hi din pehle unke daftar white house ne ek tul launch kiya he
 According to the White House, if Twitter or Facebook has unfairly censored or banned a person, they can complain about it through this tool

 maadhuri dikshit ne apane ab tak ke kariyar main kai yaadgaar kirdaar nibhaae hai
 Mohini in the film Tezaab, Nisha in Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, Pooja in Dil To Pagal Hai, Chandramukhi in Devdas
 ek baar phir maadhuri film kalank main bahaar begum banakar ain, jo ek khubasurat tawayph he
 Ever since the glimpse of this character was seen by Karan Johar, the audience began to wait with eyelashes
 lakhon dil dhak-dhak karne lage
 But when Bahar Begum came, it felt like autumn came
 maadhuri kii hansatii ankhen bujh gai hai
 The tinkle of laughter has evaporated somewhere
 chehre par chamak se zyada mechap kii parate hai
 Fans have always seen Madhuri doing one or three with her flirtatious actions
 us maadhuri ko dekha he jo dil to pagal he ga de to divaana bana detii he
 If Madhuri who becomes Devdas's Chandramukhi, she kills with eyes
 maadhuri kaa aisa hi jaadu dekhne darshak 17 april ko cinemahol main pahunche
 Madhuri appeared in the film Kalank but that Grace was missing
 vaise is baat kii bhanak maadhuri ke tabah ho gaye gane se lag gai thi
 Seeing the film's song ruined, it did not take even a few minutes for any Madhuri fan to break her heart
 lekin isaki jimmedaar khud maadhuri se zyada wo team he jisane kalank main maadhuri ke mechap or dressop par kaam kiya
 Looking at makeup, it felt like trying to print the age instead of looking beautiful
 jo maadhuri khil-khilaakar hansatii thi, uski hansi par hajaar bandishen thi
 Yes, there was definitely a plastic smile, which does not suit Madhuri's face
 View this post on instagramfelt blessed playing a character so mysterious and enchanting

 It was not the charm that was in Chandramukhi
 ghar more paradesiya gane main to maadhuri kaa kad aalia ke aage chota laga
 While Aaliya looked beautiful while dancing, Madhuri's magic looked colorless
 is film main maadhuri ne wig pahana he, is baat kaa pataa saaf chalata he
 However, in many earlier films, Madhuri has resorted to wig and makeup
 aamtaur par actress nakli wig or mechap yuj karti hai
 But when their balance deteriorates, it looks ugly on the screen
 yahi bhaddaapan dekhakar laga maadhuri ab sanyas kyon nahin le letin?mana umr kaa asar chehre par hota he, isamen maadhuri kii galati bhi nahin
 But in the 51-year-old Madhuri, the 25-year-old did not have that magic, it is also important to recognize this
 varanaa aisa kab hua ki maadhuri parde par aae or dhadkane na bad jaaen
 But the blur put an eclipse on Madhuri, which says that Madhuri's Hum Aapke Hain Kaun Nisha, Devdas's Chandramukhi, heart is mad that it is useless to find Pooja

 gorakhpur ke biardi medical college main oxigen gas silendaron kii kami se aspataal main hui bacchon kii maut ne puure desh ko hilaa diya he
 Everyone is involved in the grief of the families and is demanding strict action against the culprits
 ghatana ke baad medical college ke dow
 Kafeel Khan's name surfaced, stating that he asked for and helped oxygen cylinders in difficult times
 lekin ab kapheel se judi kai nai baaten saamne aa rahi hai
 Which represents a completely different story
 medical college main kam, nijee clinics main zyada practicemedical college se jude kai logon ne un media reports par hairaani jataai he, jinamein kapheel ko kisi farishte kii tarah dikhaaya gaya he
 While the truth is completely different
 dow kapheel biardi medical college ke incephelitis department ke chif nodel officer hai lekin wo medical college se zyada apni privet practice ke liye jane jate hai
 Helped by friends, he is alleged to have used oxygen cylinders from the hospital at his private clinic, according to the information, there was a deep nexus between Kafeel and Principal Rajiv Mishra and both are most responsible for the accident
 lekin haadase ke baad se hi unhen farishte kii tarah dikhaaya gaya tha, kaha ja rahaa he ki isamen unhone apane patrkaar doston kii madad lee
 Nothing was told to the yogi
 kapheel medical colejki kharid cameti kaa member hai, unhen bhi oxigen supplai kii sthiti ke bare main puri jaankaree thi
 2 days ago, when CM Yogi came on a visit to Adityanath Medical College, he was also roaming around him
 lekin usne bhi unhen oxigen kii bakaayaa rakam ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya
 Commission for every purchase Many employees and doctors of Taymedical College have confirmed that Dr
 Kafeel used to take commission in every purchase that took place there and transfer a fixed part of it to Principal Rajiv Mishra
 oxigen company puspa cells ke saath chal rahe vivaad main bhi rajeev mishra ke saath kapheel kaa bada haath tha
 Most of the people we spoke to said that Dr
 Rajeev Mishra, his wife Purnima Shukla and Dr
 kapheel ahamed saare haadase ke asli doshi hai
 Inquiry into the role of Kafeel Many medical college staff told us that Kafeel was in his private hospital on Friday when there was an uproar over the news of the death of the children
 vahaan se unhone kuch silendaron ko aspataal bhijwa diya
 Because these were the cylinders which he himself had stolen from the medical college
 unhone media ko bataaya ki in silendaron kaa intjaam unhone apni jeb se kiya he jabaki aisa kuch nahin tha
 The environment created in the media in its own right: a doctor who is a member of the purchase committee himself could buy the cylinder before the governmental way instead of doing so
 din main bhi jab media pahunchi tobaar-baar kapheel hi baharaakar media se baat karne lage, jabaki wo iske liye adhikrut nahin hai
 The rest of the doctors were in the care of the children, but Kafeel was focused on the media
 mohammad sahab kii kabr ko madina se hataakar unke avshesh ko kisi agyaat jagah main le jane ke prastaav se muslim jagat do bhaagon main bant gaya he
 The British newspaper The Independent reported this
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki islam ke pavithratam sthalon main se ek he madina kaa al-masjid al-nabavi or vahiin par he paigambar mohammad kii kabr
 Under the green dome of the mosque are the remains of the Prophet
 vahaan har saal lakhon tirth yatri jate hai or apana sammaan vyakt karte hai
 Now a well-known scholar from Saudi Arabia has proposed that the place be torn down and his remains taken to an unknown place and buried
 is prastaav se vahaan kaaphi vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 a large section of Muslims is opposing any such proposal
 uskaa kahana he ki yah galat hoga
 Another scholar from Saudi Arabia has opposed this
 usne makka ke pavitra jagahon ko tode jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The scholar is said to have stated in his 61-page document that the chamber surrounding Muhammad Sahab's tomb be destroyed
 ye kaksh shiya mulasamaanon ke liye bahut pavitra hai or ve badi taadaad main vahaan jate hai
 Muhammad Sahab's wife and daughters lived there
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki mohammad sahab ke avshesh paas ke al-baki kabrgah main le jaakar agyaat jagah par dafna die jaaen taaki kisi ko pataa nahin chale
 But Shia religious leaders are strongly opposed to this proposal
 unka kahana he ki is tarah ke kadam se asantosh failega or uske gambhir parinaam honge
 al-masjid al-nabawi is a pilgrimage site of great importance to both Shia and Sunni
 darasal saudi arab ke kattar islam main is tarah ke sthal kii aradhana saaf manaa he
 They do not want anyone to go to that place and pray
 unka kahana he ki islam main murti puja manaa he or yah usee kaa ek rup he
 So they want to remove the tomb of Muhammad from there
 saudi arab ke badshaah abdulla is sthal ke castodian hai or aakhri faisla un par hi nirbhar karata he
 He had developed the area around the mosque with great diligence
 al-masjid al-nabavi main mohammad sahab or unke parivaar ke logon kii jeevani bade hi khubasurat dhang se likhi gai he
 It is being told that it is proposed to destroy them all
 is dastavej par ab vichaar hoga
 It has been referred to the committees that oversee the mosques there
 vahaan kii ek patrika main in prastaavon ke bare main kaaphi kuch chapa he
 The Ghaziabad police raided Muradnagar area and recovered 1200 bags of illegally stored grain
 ye anaaj sarkari he, jinhen kalabazari ke liye godaamon main store kiya gaya tha
 Muradnagar police raided 5 godowns on Jawali road led by deputy SP and district food supply officer
 jahaan se kareeb 1200 bori gehun or 1 bori chaaval baraamad kiye gayi hai
 These sacks of food grains are the Marka (stamp) of the Uttar Pradesh government, which was kept here for black marketing
 bataaya jaataa he ki is anaaj ko bihar, rajasthan or punjab main bechaa jaataa he
 The grain on which the poor are entitled, was sold through black marketing
 logon kaa aarope he ki kalabazari kii soochna pehle bhi kai baar jila aapurti vibhaag ko di, lekin aapurti vibhaag ne koi kaarywahi nahin kii, jiske baad police ko soochna di gayi
 Many people have also been detained in this case
 is baat kii padtaal bhi shuru ho gai he ki is gorakhdhandhe ke peeche koun log hai
 Officials say that this too will be investigated
 sawaal ye he ki jahaan garib logon ko anaaj khaane ko nahin mil rahaa, vahiin itane bade paimaane par garibon ko bantane vaale anaaj kii kalabazari kar kuch log moti rakam kama rahe hai or aapurti vibhaag khabar die jane ke baavjood aakhir kyon bekhbar bana rahaa? After the embarrassing defeat of the Indian team in the Oval Test, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that the successive failures have had an impact on the confidence of the team's top order which failed to withstand the pressure
 unhone bhartiya team ke england se paanch maichon kii siries 1-3 se ganvaane ke liye anubhav kii kami ko bhi jimmedaar tehraaya
 On quitting the captaincy, Dhoni said, 'wait, keep watching
 'dhoni ne paanchvaan test pari or 244 ran se ganvaane ke baad kaha, 'top order ko score nahin banane kaa dabaav mahasoos hua
 It has to withstand the pressure in Test cricket
 agar ballebaaj thodaa sanbhal kar khelte to yah behatar ho saktaa tha
 Our batsmen performed poorly from the start, although the lower order helped a bit
 isse top order kaa pradarshan thodaa chhip gaya, sirf 150-160 ran kaa score bananaa gharelu team ke khilaaf bachaav ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 Asked about England's conditions, Dhoni said, "it is difficult but the wicket was good, it had good pace and bounce
" badalon bhare halaat main tej gendbaajon ko swing milti he
 Hoping for a better performance, Dhoni, however, hoped that his young players would take a lesson from this series and would do better next time they come to England
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, 'hamane paanch test maichon kii siries ke dauraan kaaphi aatmavishvaas khoyaa he
 It is disappointing, but it will have a lot of experience that young players will learn
 inamen se kaaphi ne videsh main test match nahin khelaa he or ummid karte hai ki ve is sabak kaa istemaal bhavishya main karenge
 "he did everything for the better", Dhoni said that he could not do much differently to improve his team
 unhone kaha, 'hamane sabakuch kiya jo ham kar sakate the
 If we played with Rohit Sharma, the difficulty was who we would keep out
 anjiky rahane ne lordrs main shatak jadaa tha
 Pujara bats at number three, Virat at fourth and then me
 ham jo kuch kar sakate the, hamane koshish kii
 Lacking experience, Haredhoni said the disappointing performance of his young team was due to lack of experience playing in England
 unhone kaha, 'paanch maichon kii test siries kaaphi kathin hoti he
 You can see Bhubaneswar, it has been affected, but we cannot give it to anyone
 hamaare antim ekadash main kai badlaav nahin ho sakate, isaliye hamaare paas anubhav kii kami he lekin tab tak ve antarrashtriya cricket nahin khelte unhen anubhav nahin milegaa
 It is important to play here, learn lessons and make a strong comeback
 ' In the last five months in Uttar Pradesh, two police officers committed suicide for different reasons
 apane adhikariyon ke aatmahatya karne se upi police pareshaan he
 One of the officers who committed suicide was from the anti-terrorism Squad (ATS), while the other was posted as SP (eastern) in Kanpur

 He said that in order to deal with these things, policemen need to stand up against mistakes and balance their personal and professional lives, while the political department needs to understand that better policing is better only with police and its officers And can be achieved through cordial relations

 700 of them cast their votes
 lekin gaanv waalon ne bataaya ki yahaan ke log patna, ranchi or anya shaharon main kaam karte hai or ve vot dene ke liye nahin aa sake
 a villager, on the condition of anonymity, said that the voting officer had put the fingerprints only on those who asked for it
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki haalanki uski patni gaanv main nahin thi lekin koi anya uske naam kaa vot daal gaya
 The other person of the village, GK Singh said that in general, our village does not have more than 400 votes, but this time only BJP people were here

 Now # BJP will win min 50 seats in UP
 If @yadavakhilesh and @mayawati could have joint hand with @rahulgandhi So # BJP can win max 10 seats
 Means # SP and # BSP are responsible to make # Modi Ji PM again
 And Now Mayawati Ji can become the PM in her dream every night

 manoj bajpeyi iskaa garv se ullekh karte hai ki enesdy ne unhen apane yahaan padhane kaa mauka nahin diya, lekin padhaane ke liye bulaayaa
 The check received as remuneration for teaching has been kept by Manoj Bajpayee till now
 enesdy kyon aana chaahate the? iske jawaab main manoj bajpeyi ne kaha ki 'enesdy main admician milane se unka bahut sara sangharsh kam ho jaataa, jo unhen baahar rahete hue karnaa pad rahaa tha
 If NSD were trained with the best color workers, then the craft of acting would have helped to shape it
 enesdy main admician nahin mila to manoj ne devendra raaj ankur ke netritv main chal rahe enesdy passout ke samooh 'sambhav' ko jwoin kiya
 The drama 'apna Morcha' of 'sambhav' was very popular, in which Manoj acted
 actor ke liye anushaasan ko manoj bajpeyi jarur bataate hai
 He used to say that 'I have followed discipline in life
 abhinayta bananaa he to aapaki subah reharsal se shuru honi chahie, shikaayat se nahin
 This is your lifestyle, which makes you look different from any other person or actor '
 abhinayta ko prerana badalati rahani chahie
 So much of life cannot work with a single role model, so he said that my role models have been changing depending on the demand of acting '
 cinema yaa theatre ke liye diarector kii bhoomika ko ahm bataate hue unhone kaha ki mere liye kairectorigeshan kii-point rahaa he
 The director is supreme for me
 actor ko apane kaam se uske vijan ko ekstand karnaa chahie
 The actor is one who does not swallow the director '
 tippaniyan Stating the extent of cinema, Manoj Bajpayee also expressed his opinion on the debate on the censor board in the country
 unhone kaha ki 'sensor board bahut aloktantric he, hamaare jaise loktantr main
 Films should be rated according to the age group and the board should only give certificates
 abhibhavak behtareen sensor hote hai, agar wo kaam nahin karte to sensor bhi nahin kar sakegaa
 Sensors have lost their importance in this digital time '
 manoj bajepayi ne ek bahut jaruri baat kahi ki 'cinema or naatakon main ham realism shabd par bahut jor dete hai
 We are forgetting the character
 realism ke naam par desh main bahut bada frod chal rahaa he
 Significantly, during his struggle days, Manoj Bajpayee made several attempts for admission to NSD, but he failed
 unki yah kasak is dauraan bhi jhalki, lekin shikayati andaaj main nahin
 Manoj Bajpayee proudly mentions that the NSD did not give him a chance to study here, but invited him to teach
 padhaane ke liye paarishramik ke rup main mili check ko abhi tak manoj bajepayi ne sambhaal kar rakhaa hua he
 Why did NSD want to come? In response to this, Manoj Bajpayee said that 'getting admission in NSD would reduce a lot of their struggle, which they had to do while outside
 enesdy main behtareen rangakarmiyon ke saath training hoti thi to abhinay kaa jo craft hota he, usko taraashne main madad milti'
 If the admission was not received in NSD, Manoj joined the group 'sambhav' of NSD passout under the leadership of Devendra Raj Ankur
 'sambhav' kaa naatak 'apana morcha' behad charchit rahaa tha, jisamen manoj ne abhinay kiya tha
 Manoj Bajpayee definitely explains the discipline for the actor
 unka kahana tha ki 'maine jivan main anushaasan kaa paalan kiya he
 If you want to become an actor, then your morning should start with rehearsal and not with complaint
 ye aapaki jeevanstyli he, jisase aap kisi duusare vyakti yaa abhinayta se alag dikhte hai'
 The motivation of the actor must change
 jivan ke itane rup main kisi ek role model se kaam nahin chal saktaa, isliye unhone kaha ki abhinay kii maang ke aadhaar par mere role model badalte rahe hai'
 Describing the role of director as important for cinema or theater, he said that characterization has been a key point for me
 nirdeshak mere liye supreme he
 The actor should extend his vision with his work
 actor vah he jo nirdeshak ko niget na kare'
 The comments cinema kii seemaa bataate hue manoj bajpeyi ne desh main sensor board par chal rahi bahes par bhi apana mat prakat kiya
 He said that 'the censor board is very undemocratic, in a democracy like ours
 filmon ko ayuvarg ke anusaar rate karnaa chahie or board ko keval certificate dene chahie
 Parents are the best censors, if they do not work, then even the censors will not be able to do it
 is digital samay main sensor apana mahatv kho chukaa he'
 Manoj Bajpayee made a very important point that in cinema and dramas, we put a lot of emphasis on the word realism
 ham kairactor ko bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 There is a huge fraud going on in the country in the name of realism
 enesdy kyon aana chaahate the? iske jawaab main manoj bajpeyi ne kaha ki 'enesdy main admician milane se unka bahut sara sangharsh kam ho jaataa, jo unhen baahar rahete hue karnaa pad rahaa tha

 jahaan tak chidambaram ke aane kaa sawaal or jail main unhen rakhane kii baat he, to jail ko koi khaas intjaam nahin karne hai
 He said, 'everything is pre-decided according to the jail manual
 chunki chidambaram kii umr 70 saal ke aasapaas he
 Therefore, there is also a strong possibility of being locked up in the cell of jail number-1 by law
 saath hi sone ke liye unhen lakdi kaa takht diya jayega, yah bhi tay he
 Also, they will be provided blankets from the jail side
 airkandishnar or gadde ke intjaam kaa jail minial main kahin koi zikr nahin hai
 'another jail source told that,' Jail number one was once in a while Harikishan Lal Bhagat (HKL Bhagat 1984 Sikh riot accused), Chandra Swamy, Mamaji, former Union Minister Sukhram, caught in the Commonwealth Games held in Delhi in 2010

 chidambaram ke magar jail number ek main pahunchate hi vahaan tispi javaanon kii sankhya or badha di jaaegi
 According to the Jail Manual, number one prisoners are provided with one pulse, one vegetable, four and five rotis
 chidambaram ko bhi yahi khaanaa khaane ko diya jayega
 It would be different if only Chidambaram should be provided food in a separate kitchen in jail number one and not in the jail-langar
 yah sab ehtiyathan or suraksha ke maddenjar jail minial ke mutabik hi bataaya jaataa he
 According to Tihar Jail sources, if Chidambaram refuses to eat the kitchen food of the jail, he will be allowed to order some food from the Tihar jail canteen as per the rules

 Generally, only superintendents of CBI and above level officers stay in these suites
 yah alag baat he ki agusta westland ke aaropee chrishchiyan mishael or duusare maamle ke charchit naam satish sanaa ko bhi sibiai ne inhen main se ek suite main rakhaa tha
 According to CBI headquarters sources, 'these special suites on the ground floor have all facilities like AC, double-bed, fridge, geyser, television
 'haalanki yah khaas suites sirf or sirf safedposh aparaadhiyon ko hi remand avadhi main rakhane ke liye sibiai istemaal karti he jabaki khoonkhaar aparaadhiyon ke liye yahaan baqayada hawalat (lowep) kaa bhi intjaam he
 It is worth mentioning here that the court has allowed Chidambaram's family to meet him half an hour daily during the remand period
 saath hi 48 ghante ke andar aaropee kii medical jaanch karaane ke nirdesh bhi adaalat ne jaanch agency ko die hai

 Seeing the friendship between Japan and India, China has returned again
 china ne kaha ki kshetreey deshon ko gathjod banane kii bajaay saajhedaari ke vaaste kaam karnaa chahie
 However, China hoped that the growing relationship between India and Japan would be helpful for peace and stability

 India and Japan signed 15 agreements to broaden their strategic partnership and agreed to strengthen cooperation in the indo-pacific region where China is increasing its aggression
 bharat-japanke bich ranneetik saajhedaari badhane ke bare main puche jane parchinake videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chunaying ne kaha, ‘‘ham isaki pairvi karte hai ki deshon ko takaraav ke bina samvaad ke liye khadey hona chahie or gathjod kii bajaay saajhedaari ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 He, however, declined to comment on specific issues such as Japan's plan to sell US 2i Amphibious aircraft to India
 unhone kaha ki vah abe or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bich baithak ke baad donon deshon kii ore se vistrut bayaan jari hone kaa intjaar karnaa chahengi
 Japan's plan to sell such amphibious aircraft to India has raised eyebrows in China, as it is the first such step by Japan to sell defense equipment to any other country
 iske saath hi bharat main japan ko pehali bullate train pariyojna milane ko lekar bhi china chintit he jo ki ahmedabad or mumbai ke bich banegi

 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham ummid karte hai ki sambandh kshetreey shanti evam sthirataa ke liye anukool hoga or is sambandh main ek rachanaatmak bhoomika nibhaayega
 Commenting on Abe's visit to India, China's think tanks said that with both the "freedom Corridor", India and Japan jointly undertaking infrastructural projects in various countries cost China an ambitious billions of dollars
 Is being seen as a strategic response against the 'belt and Road Initiative'
 bharat-japan kii sanyukt pahal ‘freedom coridor’ asia se africa tak vistaarit he or iskaa uddeshy kshetra main sthirataa pradaan karnaa he
 "the Freedom Corridor is designed in response to China's BRI and is expected to dominate the talks between Abe and Modi," said Hu Zhiong, a research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations
 
 ’’ vahiin univarsity of international relations main associat professor chu in ne kaha ki japan or bharat kii yah pahal keval ek shuruuaat he

 According to sources, Shatrughan Sinha was looking for avenues for his entry into the Congress after the ticket was cut from Patna Sahib and was in constant touch with the top command of the party
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 28 march ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke samaksh shatrughna sinha party kaa daaman tham lenge or unhen patna sahib se ravishankar prasad ke khilaaf maidan main utaara jayega
 Significantly, last week, a list of 40 candidates of Bihar NDA was released for the Lok Sabha elections, in which the party gave ticket to Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Sahib
 2014 main narendra modi sarkaar banane ke baad se hi shatrughna sinha lagaataar party ke khilaaf bayaanbaji kar rahe the or pichley kuch dinon se khaskar rafel saude ke mudde par unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa tha or rafel deal main unki kathith sanliptata ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye the
 Shatrughan Sinha gave direct signs of leaving the BJP on Friday
 pichley kaaphi dinon se party se naaraaz chal rahe sinha ne party chhodane kaa ishaara karte hue twit kar apane khaas andaaj main likhaa, mohabbat karne vaale kam na honge, (shaayad) teri mehfil main lekin ham na honge
 Shatrughan, popularly known as film actor and 'bihari Babu', has been making public statements on several occasions, moving away from the 'party line'
 purv kendriya mantri shatrughna sinha ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore ishaara karte hue ek anya twit main likhaa, "sar, raashtra aapkaa sammaan karata he, par netritv main vishwasaneeyata or vishwaas kii kami he
 Are people trusting what the leadership is doing and saying? Probably not
 khayr, ab kaaphi der ho chuki he
 "shatrughan Sinha said that the promises made to the public are still to be fulfilled which will not be fulfilled now
 aashaa, ichha or prarthana, haalanki main ab aapke saath nahin rah saktaa
 Yesterday, had the pleasure of meeting a dear family friend, Lalu Prasad Yadav @ laluprasadrjdin Ranchi once again
 It's so inspiring & comforting to see him bravely fighting despite ailing health in his difficult situation
 His determination & cheerful approach is his strength

 Earlier too, Sinha has been praising former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav on several occasions
 rajdhani lakhanu or aas-paas ke ilaakon main buudhvaar subah mausam ke achaanak karavat badalane ke baad hui boondabandi se thandak mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Meteorological Department officials said the weather has changed due to western disturbances
 agle 24 ghanton ke dauraan rajya ke madhya ilaakon main boondabandi kii sambhaavna he
 Already day and night temperatures are being recorded in the state
 ab mausam main hue badlaav or boondabandi se taapmaana main or giravat ke asaar hai
 The minimum temperature of capital Lucknow on Wednesday morning was 16
 7 degree celsius darj kiya gaya
 The maximum temperature of the day is forecast to be around 32 degrees
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main shanivaar ko hajratganj ke dalibagh ilaake main us vakt afratfari much gai, jab yahaan par vidhayak nivas ke saamne puraani furniture mandi main achaanak aag lag gai
 On seeing the fire, it took a terrible form
 is haadase main saikadon jhopadiyaan aag kii chapet main aa gayi
 People's shelter and belongings were completely gutted in the horrific fire
 aag itani bheeshan thi ki log apni jaan bachaane ke liye vahaan se bhaagate najar aae
 However, the reason for the fire has not been revealed yet
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jhopadiyon main rakhe silendaron kii vajah se ye haadasa hua he
 The fire was not immediately reported to the Divisional Department and the police
 isi vajah se aag lagane ke kaaphi der baad bhi damakal kii koi gaadi maukey par nahin pahunchi
 People themselves kept struggling to save their belongings and their lives
 aag kii bhayavahata ko dekhte hue aas-paas ke puure ilaake ko logon ne khud hi khaali kar diya
 It is worth noting that the MLA and the minister's residence are right in front of the fire where the fire has taken place
 damakal vibhagaki badi laaparvaahee bhi saamne ai he
 Because despite receiving information, the fire brigade and all the officials reached the scene after a long time
 is aag main kisi kii jaan to nahin gai or kitna nuksaan hua ye jaanch ke baad hi saaf ho paaegaa
 Let us tell you that Vidya Balan was not only appreciated by the success of the film 'kahaani', but also director Sujoy Ghosh was able to make a different identity in the world of direction
 haalanki is film ke baad sujoy ne ruthik or katrina caff ke saath 'baing baing' banaai thi jo darshakon ko bahut zyada nahin lubhaa pai thi
 Apart from this, along with Radhika Apte, she made a short film 'ahilya' which was well liked on social media
 behad khaas kism kii training paae 18 bhartiya jawan kisi duusare desh kii jameen par agle aadesh ke liye intjaar karte rahe
 They were waiting for the order, after which they had to destroy the camps of the terrorist organization National Socialist Council of Nagaland (khaplang), located within the border of Myanmar
 is baat ko ab tak gupt rakhaa gaya tha ki kaise bhartiya sena ke vishesh training paae commando kii ek choti si team ne alag rajya kii maang hinsa failaa rahe algaavvaadiyon ko na sirf dhundha balki unako maar bhi giraaya
 NDTV now has information about how that particular operation was carried out on 9 June
 21 special forces batalian ke commando jo ki purvottar ke ghaney jangalon kii ladaai main maahir hote hai, unhone dushmano kii harkaton par paini najar rakhi or apane nishane bahut saavdhaanee se chune
 On June 8, at 11 o'clock, these commandos entered deep forests and on foot entered the Myanmar border
 9 june kii subah 4:45 baje, suryoday se thodaa pehle hamale kaa vakt tha
 The incharge of the team that carried out this secret operation was a young lieutenant colonel (names cannot be given for security reasons)
 wo khud team kaa netritv kar rahaa tha
 Then there was a paratrooper whom he calls his friend, a sergeant and another paratrooper from his team
 in chaaron ko varshon tak purvottar ke ghaney jangalon main atyaadhik garmi or umas bhare maahaul main bhi ladane kii training mili he
 These four were the best for a military campaign that the Indian Army could have chosen - experienced and highly skilled in killing the country's enemies, and even entering the border of another country if needed
 aapako bataa den ki is oparation ke hafte bhar pehle hi aatankwaadiyon ne 18 javaanon ko maar daalaa tha
 The government was committed to proving its strong intentions to fight terrorism, even if it had to sneak into another country and conduct a secret campaign
 leftinent karnal ne do nishane tay kiye the
 Havildar and his paratrooper attacked the post at a short distance, while the team leader accompanied his friend to the other post
 is kshetra main chal rahe vidrohiyon ke training camp ke ek post par aatanki us vakt bhi sakriya the
 His people were cautious
 lekin jangal main chhupate hue hawaldaar apane paratrupar ke saath rengte hue us post tak pahunchaa
 The paratrooper visited the area while the sergeant crawled to the enemy post where a gun-toting terrorist was present
 post par tainaat aatankwaadi kii mashinagan jis suraakh se baahar nikali hui thi wo uski pahunch se zyada dur nahin thi
 The sergeant immediately set the terrorist's hideout with the gun with his silencer through the same hole
 uske baad usne ek anya aatanki ko sir main goli maari jabaki duusare ko behad kareeb se goli maari
 This entire action took less than a minute
 iske baad behad khamoshi se wo jhaadiyon main gum ho gaye or apane commanding officer, leftinent karnal ko teen aatankiyon ko maar giraane kii khabar di
 After that they started waiting and vahaan se thodi hi duuri par leftinent karnal or uskaa paratrupar dost bina koi aawaaj kiye duusare post par pahunch gaye
 He killed two terrorists with his silencer Uzi sub machine gun and immediately came out of the second post
 vahaan se kareeb 30 meter kii duuri par dushman kaa ek bunker tha
 Some sounds were coming from the bunker, the lieutenant colonel threw a grenade into the bunker and then went inside
 agar leftinent karnal ne sochaa tha ki ek grenade se saare aatanki maare jaaenge to wo galat tha
 Four terrorists were injured inside the bunker and they also tried to attack
 lekin leftinent karnal ne apni uji se chaaron ko maar giraaya
 The colonel then ordered a team of Indian para commandos waiting nearby to attack the terrorist camps vigorously
 uske nirdesh par special forces ke 21 commando ne rocket propeld grenade se apane nishane par 20 minute se bhi zyada vakt tak firing karte rahe
 The comments ab tak bhartiya commando ne jis camp par hamalaa kiya tha isaki jaankaree aatankiyon ko ho chuki thi or kareeb ilaake ke 10-12 banksron se bhartiya commando team par firing hone lagi
 But the Indian Army had broken its back with a rocket propelled grenade attack and the four commandos on the spot, who were taking on the terrorists, clashed with the terrorists running towards the Indian border
 is oparation ke liye shaury chakra vijeta yuva leftinent karnal ko kirti chakra pradaan kiya gaya jo ki shaantikaal kaa doosraa sabase bada bahaduri puraskaar he
 And the Havildar, who attacked the first post of the enemy, was awarded the Shaurya Chakra which is the third highest gallantry award given during the first peacetime

 meri pehali ''dharmik" smriti maut ke aavaran main lipati hui he
 Yet it is more lively than most things i know

 He is wrapped in white clothes, chest is open
 aasapaas shok magn log hai

 kitni teji se, ek kshan main, ek aadmi yaa aurat ''avshesh", ''shav" main badal jaataa he
 "he" becomes "

 ) This Bhavsagar Yatra is described in the Bhagavad Gita as such
 or is sharir ke saath bhi aisa hua he
 i was told that i was there at that time
 main bas teen saal kaa tha, lekin mujhe kuch yaad nahin
 But it doesn't matter, because that picture, taken about an hour after Gandhi's assassination, has been permanently engraved in my mind
 vah lakwaha hameshaa ke liye ankit ho gaya he
 It has been and will remain a deeply religious moment, a profound Hindu moment for me
 main mandiron main gaya hum, maine pravachan sune hai, hindu granthon kaa paath kiya he, lekin main aise kisi anubhav se nahin gujara hum—is maamle main puri tarah se apane dimag kii khidki main—jab maine itnaa zyada dharmik, zyada hindu mahasoos kiya ho, jitna ki ek maut kii us tasviir ke saath, us pal ke saath, jo ki mere liye jivan or uske punararambh ke bare main, sajiv ke bare main he
 Along with this scene, there is a fragrance, a sound in my mind, the scent of incense sticks and the sound of prayer
 main us tasviir main logon ko raghupati raghav raja ram gaate hue sun saktaa hum
 This is the song that Gandhi had chosen, included Allah and God in it and included it in his daily prayer congregation
 mere mastishk ne us sugandh or prarthana geet ko tasviir par aropit kar diya he
 Together they symbolize my first religious memory, my first "hindu" memory, and my first awareness of being a Hindu
 ek tasviir, ek sugandh or ek geet kii yah trayee ek paraspar jude kram se sambandhit he or yah kram is prakaar heronai dilli ke birla house parisar main 20 janvari, 1948 ko jab gandhi apni dainik prarthana sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe thekruyah koi saamaanya sabha nahin, prarthana sabha thi—ek kuch halke kism ke visphot se puri mandali kii shanti ko bhang ho gai
 Gandhi did not know, could not even know why this explosion happened, but to the angry crowd he said, "listen, listen, listen, listen
" 
 
 kuch nahin hua he
 
 
 "and after that when the noise of the restless crowd ceased, they said that Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram should be sung
 or sab log shant, sabhi log chup ho gaye
 The explosion was a small bomb that was blown up by Madanlal Pahwa, a young Hindu refugee from Pakistan
 lekin yah uskaa akele kaa kaam nahin tha
 He was a part of the whole conspiracy how to create a ruckus in the prayer meeting and then assassinate Gandhi in the midst of chaos and chaos
 lekin paahwa ke shadyantrkaari saathi chupchaap khisak liye jab unhone yah dekha ki gandhi ji kii buddhi kaushal or sabha main upasthit logon kii paripakvata kii vajah se jaisaa unhone sochaa tha waisi koi afra-tafari nahin machi
 but
 30 janvari, 1948 kii shamko kareeb 2,000 kimi dur madras main ''emes" ke naam se mashhoor madurai shanmukhavadiu subbulakshmi jab radio par sant tyagaraj kaa bhakthi sangeet sun rahi thim, tabhi kaarykram achaanak ruk gaya or ek ghoshnaa hui
 Mahatma is no more
 unhen goli maar di gai thi
 Shot by a man who is said to be associated with an extremist Hindu organization
 yah sunakar ve stabdh rah gayi, jaise hajaaron log hairaan rah gaye the
 After a while he heard his own voice on the same radio station
 akashwani par is ghoshnaa ke tatkaal baad, mahaan kalpanashiltaa or usee tarah sajagata ke saath, subbulakshmi kaa mirabai geet pesh kiya gaya jise unhone gandhi ji ke liye akashwani ko record karaayaa thamhari, tum haro jan kii bheer, kuch vidwaan jan kii bheer ko jan kii pir bhi kehete hai, jiskaa braj main matlab dard yaa pidaa hota he
 It is a complete series, starting with an explosion followed by a listen, a sound of a listen and then a quiet Raghupati Raghav song, followed by three gunshots on January 30 and Hey Ram! This sequence ends with Subbulakshmi in her own voice, Geethari, Tiro Haro Jan Ki Bhirse
 yah silsilaa mere purvajon ke dharm main meraa vyaktigat prasthaan bindu he
 In general terms, the religion about which they used to think and speak, religion or "right way to live"
 kya ve use ''hindu" dharm kehete the? mere kchayaal se ve kehete the, lekin kab unke purvajon yaa unke bhi purvajon ne ''hindu" shabd kaa istemaal shuru kiya, main nahin bataa saktaa
 i lack knowledge in this matter, but i know that he never stopped calling his beliefs a religion
 unhone shaayad ''hindu" ko dharm ke purv pratyay yaa vistaar kii tarah istemaal kiya ho, lekin yah dharm tha, sahi kaam karnaa, jiske myne the
 Religion was his religious principle, religion was his practice
 dharm pehle se maujuud niyamavali, shaastra or samhita tha
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan is perfectly right, "hinduism
 
 
 tarkshakti or sahaj-gyaan kaa aisa mail he, jise paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki sirf anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 "at the core of the January 1948 sequence is an extraordinary religious chain of knowledge and experience, which is a confluence of extraordinary aesthetics and religious aesthetics
 ek shantipurna dharmik samagam main hinsa kaa paap kiya gaya, jo apane aap main ek adharmik krity he
 And in response to this, violence was not committed, but rather, based on instincts, and a call to prayer, which is the exact opposite of violence
 lekin hinsa kii vaapasi or zyada durust tathaa krur tareeke se hui, taaki mahaan prarthana or ahimsak dharm ke sarvocch swaroop kaa muqabla kiya ja sake
 It was an actual experience of death that included the call of Rama, the perfect act of surrendering to the will of God, without any dissatisfaction or accusation, pleading to God to accept his life, his soul and everything
 or uske baad jab gandhi kaa bhautik sharir panchtatv main mil jane kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha, ''madurai kii devi minakshi kii beti", saraswati kii sadhana karne vaali kalakaar subbulakshmi apni hi aawaaj main vah gaanaa sun rahi thim, jise unhone puri maanavtaa ke liye gaaya tha, mewar kii beti mirabai kaa geet jisamen vah maanavtaa ko bhay, dard se chhutkaaraa dene kaa nivedan kar rahi hai
 Fear
 dard
 What fear What kind of pain? Fear of torture of violence, pain given by forceful
 hari, tum haro jan kii bheer geet atyaachaar, barbar takat or hinsa ke astitv ko sweekaar karata he
 It sincerely and humbly accepts that fear exists in all this and that pain is a truth of human life
 usamen draupadi ko dushshasan kii havas se bachaane kii, sarvashaktishaalee rakshas hiranyakashyap ke vishnu ke ek avatar nursingh dwaara vadh kii, ek hathi ko magaramchh ke panjon se bachaane kii baat he, to yah bhautik bal ke upar naitik bal kii shreshthata kaayam rakhane kii ishwariya krupa kaa udhaaharan he
 Religion, Hinduism, as i see from my ordinary religious understanding, states that rancor exists, in a larger presence and as a performance by someone
 asuron, rakshason, ''bure logon" dwaara dwesh kyon or kis tarah se prakat kiya ja saktaa he, yah koi samaj se pare baat nahin he
 The person who broke the bomb in the prayer meeting is said to be practicing his religion according to his own accord
 jisane gandhi ko goli maari, usne kaha, use vishwaas he ki vah dharm daayitv puraa kar rahaa tha
 And Gandhi, who was certainly doing so, from his instincts and his experience of proven knowledge
 to, phir kiskaa dharm sahi dharm tha? kiske dharm ko sahi main hindu kaha jayega?yah sawaal duvidha kaa he
 The crime is justified by clever logic
 isamen sach ke saath chal hota he, dharm ko vikrut kiya jaataa he
 The crime cannot be confronted with its target, nor can the offender be compared to the victim
 ghrinaa koi dharmik bhaavana nahin he or hatya to swaghoshit rup se adharmik he
 There are of course some exceptions to this - murder for self-defense or to save someone from danger
 lekin is tarah kii hatya na to kisi ke uksaave par hoti he or na hi kisi ke hukum par
 This is just the basis
 isi tarah balaatkaar kabhi dharmik nahin ho saktaa, hatya ko shastron se jaij nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 If hatred is considered a disease, killing is absolutely degenerate
 or jansanhaar, aatanki yaa nasleey hatyaein to puri tarah pashachik kaary
 The metaphors of the ferocious Hiranyakashipu, wicked enemies and crocodile pointed jaws are real and timely
 inkaa pratirodh karnaa or iske liye krupa hasil karne kii ichha dharm he
 But to see caste as religious acceptance is a kind of craze, not religion
 isi tarah, apane panth main kattarta dekhnaa ek tarah kii vidrupata he, dharm nahin
 i am not an Arabic scholar and do not even know the Holy Quran, but i believe that faith is as close to religion as prudence
 yah sab koun kah rahaa he, yah koun anubhav karata he? saadhaaran shabdon main kahen to main
 a Hindu
 main, saadhaaran, naganya
 I, who has not read any Agam or Veda, but within whom, like any other person, is what Radhakrishnan calls "religious instincts", which is called Hinduism
 apane dharm ko khud hi paribhaashit karne kii kisi hindu ko mili ''aazaadee" hindu dharm se mili sabase badi sampada he
 When this same freedom is used to overturn religion, to break it, then it is a clever trick to steal that wealth
 dharmik hone ke liye kisi vyakti ko acha, sahi insaan bananaa hoga, jo na to kisi ke parakram se dare or na hi murkh jaisaa vyavhaar kare
