 The Yash Bharti Award was officially given under the Ministry of Culture of the state
 artiai ke khulaase ke baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii pratikriya saamne ai hai
 Justifying his decision in Azamgarh, he said that now there are BJP governments in the center and the state, you can also award your people

 Considering West Bengal's political history and the current alliances, there is a 60 per cent chance that Mamata Banerjee will win a second consecutive term as Chief Minister
 rajya main chah charnon main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan ho rahe hai
 The congress-left alliance has a 40 percent chance of victory
 lekin sab kuch voton ke utaar-chadhaav par nirbhar he, bhale hi yah thode antar se hi hon
 If three per cent of the vote from Mamata Banerjee's party Trinamool Congress turns towards the congress-left alliance, then this alliance can get a slightly 'weak' majority by securing 149 seats out of 294 seats and the Trinamool can shrink to 129 seats 
 thik isi tarah trinmul kii ore do fisadi voton kaa atirikt jhukaav mamata kii party ko 200 se adhik siten dilaa saktaa he
 Mamta Banerjee's party contested with the Congress in the 2011 assembly elections
 is chunaav main trinmul congress ne 184 siton par jeet darj kii thi, jabaki congress ko 42 siten hasil hui thim
 The Left, which has been in power in this state for decades, had to face a tough defeat that year and won only 62 seats
 2014 ke aam chunaavon tak mamata banerjee ne congress se raahen alag kar leen or vah rajya main or majboot hokar ubhartee raheen
 His party won 34 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 congress or left ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha, or donon ko 28 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat hasil hui thi
 The BJP registered its strong presence for the first time in the 2014 general elections and managed two Lok Sabha seats
 2011 main bijepi ko koi safalataa nahin mili thi or us vakt se vah rajya main apane cader ko majboot banane main juty hui thi
 In 2014, amid the wave of Narendra Modi, BJP gained 12 per cent votes, which proved to be a dent in the Left's votes
 agar left usamen se aadhe yani chah pratishat vot bhi dobaaraa hasil kar le, to iskaa matlab he ki congress-left gathbandhan ko 55 siton kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 The solidarity of the opposition, which means that this time even if the Left and Congress do not cut each other's votes, this coalition can gain 41 seats compared to two years ago
 ye donon kaaran milakar left-congress ko bahumat tak pahunchaa sakate hai
 During the 2014 general elections, the two parties could together win 56 assembly seats
 agar donon dalon ne us vakt saath chunaav ladaa hota to unhen 97 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat mil sakati thi, haalanki isse trinmul kaa varchasv khatm nahin hota
 But if the two had contested together in 2011, Mamata Banerjee might not have become the Chief Minister

 The Ministry of Home Affairs said that it is surprising that how a senior law officer like Additional Solicitor General can simultaneously and also stay on the rolls of a private body for a long period and how they are applied to the law officers of the Government of India Contrary to the rules, payments can be made for unknown purposes (foreign donations)
 iske alaava kaise association (is aashay ke bina kisi prastaav ke) aisi vyavastha par raji ho gaya or vah kyon (upyukt anapati hasil kiye bagaiyr, jise hasil karnaa epasiaar, 2010 ke tahat jaruri he) aisi vyavastha par raji ho gayi

 com / nt5v3bfs8t Taking a dig at bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi being nominated by the party from Varanasi seat, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed that Varanasi would prove to be a 'political grave' for Modi
 patna main ravivaar ko patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue lalu ne kaha, kya samajhe ho banaras ko? vah to puraa secular jagah he
 Lalu said, Narendra Modi is going to lose from there
 vah unke liye 'raajnneetik kabrgah' sabit hoga
 Lalu said about Modi, why he is running away from his state
 yah haasyapad he ki bijepi ke netaaon ko loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke liye jagah nahin mil rahi he
 They are wandering around in search of a seat
 ve (modi) surakshit seat ke liye gujarat se bhaage hai
 Lalu slammed the media organizations for denying the news that some of the rjd's angry candidates considered returning the allotted Lok Sabha seat
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne aaj ishaaron-ishaaron main centre sarkaar ko aagaah kiya ki samvidhan main adhyadesh jari karne ke adhikaar use diya zarur gaya he, lekin iskaa istemaal vishesh paristhitiyon main hi kiya janaa chahie
 President Pranab Mukherjee said this during a dialogue through video conferencing with students and teachers of iits, nits and Central University
 raashtrapati ne kaha, 'bahut majaburi main hi or kuch khaas zaruuraton kii sthiti main samvidhan nirmaataaon ne karypalika ko adhyadesh ke rup main kuch vidhaayi adhikaar saunpna zaruri mana
 For when the legislature is not in session and the circumstances indicate the need for legislation
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne yah bhi zaruri samajha tha ki sarkaar ko die gaye is vishesh adhikaar ko simit karnaa zaruri he
 Therefore, the provision to change the ordinance into law was also included in the time frame
 beete kuch maheenon main centre sarkaar aath adhyadesh laa chuki he
 Of course, the President's gesture is there only
 haalanki raashtrapati ne vipaksh ko bhi uskaa farz yaad dilaayaa
 He said, 'the basic principle of parliamentary democracy is that the majority has the right to rule, while the opposition has the right to oppose, expose it and to bring down the government if the numbers are allowed
 lekin kisi bhi surat main kaarywahi thapp nahin honi chahie
 a staggering minority should not be allowed to shut down the voice of the majority
 raashtrapati ne saansadon ko bhi aagaah kiya ki sansad main kaamkaaj pichley dekh dashak main kaaphi kam hua he
 Citing figures, the President said that the first Lok Sabha was sitting 677 days in its five-year term, while the Thirteenth Lok Sabha served 356 days, the 14th Lok Sabha 332 days and the 15th Lok Sabha only 357 days
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki sansad agar kanoon banane kii apni sanvaidhanik zimmedaari kaa nirivaahan thik se nahin karegaa to logon kaa us par vishwaas kam hoga

 They say that many times your eyes speak more than your tongue
 yaa yun kahen ki kai baar jubaan ke kahe gaye shabdon se zyada hamaare dwaara kiye gaye ishaare bahut kuch kah jate hai
 Something similar happens with your husbands too
 kai barmard khule taur par wo nahin kah patejo wo kahana chaahate hai yaa jo unke man main hota he
 In such a situation, he gives such gestures to his partner by which his mind can be understood
 ham aapako bataate hai ki wo aise koun se ishaare hai jise dekhakar aap apane patiyon ke man kii baat jaan sakati hai
 Many things are hidden in the eyes, when there are some things going on in the mind at times, then they start to go away from the eyes
 isliye mahilaon ko apane pati kii ankhon ko padhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 With this, you can find out what is going on in your husband's mind
 aisa mana gaya he ki mard sabase pehle apni ankho se apni niyat ko jataane kii koshish karte hai
 Cleanliness is also important
 It is believed that a good scent attracts the man towards you
 aise main aapako is baat kaa khyaal rakhana hoga ki aapke pati ko kab kisi khushboo pansad aati he
 To make the evening more colorful, try to use a perfume that your husband likes
 saaf safai kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhen
 Trying to touch with excuses During this time, your husband tries to touch you by flowing
 agar aapke pati aapako pyaar se choote hai, aapke chehre par thapki dete hai yaa phir komal ango ko chune kii koshish karte hai to ye samaj lijie ki unka man kis ore ishaare kar rahaa he
 If they ask you to do a head massage during this, then this is also a gesture for you
 agar aapke kaam main madad karne lagenapake pati kisi din achaanak aapke man mutabik kaam karne lage
 Started helping you in your domestic work, or sitting with you and watching your favorite serial, then understand that your husband is in the mood to do something different today

 capatoun main team india kii kismat main haari likhi thi
 Even rain could not save
 tisare din kaa khel pani main dhul gaya
 But on the fourth day, when it was sunny in Cape Town, it felt that Team India would shine in the field too
 jaise-jaise chauthe din dakshin africa ballebaaj out hote gaye, team india ke saath-saath bhartiya prashansak bhi jeet ke sapane dekhne lage
 But the dream would come true when the Indian batsmen came into the field with the intention of winning
 majboot ballebaaji 'fail'darasal chauthe din noummid ko ummid main badalane ke liye gendbaajon ne apana kaam to kar diya tha, ab number bharatiyon ballebaajon kaa tha, jisaki majbootee kii gaatha hameshaa sunate aae hai
 From top to middle order - such batsmen who can hit the target of 208 runs alone
 lekin majboot team se nahin, majboot iraade se match jite jate hai, or wo capatoun ke ground main aaj nahin dikhaai diya
 Perhaps everyone was coming on the field to bat thinking that the batsman after me would have scored these runs easily, after all, there were only 208 runs in the scoreboard
 ran banane kii hadabadi main haarakapatoun main bhartiya team kii haar ko ham keval sharmnaak nahin kah sakate
 Because 208 runs were needed to win and more than one and a half days were left
 phir bhartiya ballebaajon main ran banane kii jo hadabadi thi
 Seeing it, he felt that the match was being played to end soon, with little intention of winning
 shaayad 208 ran kaa lakshya kam lag rahaa tha or isse jald 'tii-20 style' main nipat kar khilaadi saiyr-sapate ke mood main the
 ashwin-bhuvi had raised hopes, although it was not easy to score on this Cape Town pitch, but at one time r Ashwin and Bhuvneshwar Kumar had created a hope by sharing 49 runs
 bhale hi aswin 37 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 But the batting of both of them opened the top order
 jab ye donon pich par tik sakate hai to phir wo kyon nahin tike jinka kaam hi pich par tikna tha? yahi nahin, ye bhi laga ki koi ballebaaj ko bataane vaala nahin tha ki aapkaa kaam is vakt tabadatod ran bananaa nahin he, keval krij par khadaa rahanaa he
 Is the churning necessary for this defeat? The way the entire team was reduced to 135 runs, it was clear that only the batsmen could not escape by blaming the pitch
 ballebaaj ke saamne lanbaa vakt tha, keval krij par khadey rahane kii jarurat thi
 When standing at the crease, runs would automatically connect
 ek tarah se ye haar ko 'jaldbaaji main jeet' main jeet kaa nateeja he
 Team India should also do this churn
 ye aankade gavalgar aap bhartiya ballebaajon ke ran or gend kii tulana karen to tasviir saaf ho jaaegi ki ballebaaj kitni jaldbaaji the
 Murali Vijay 13 runs in 32 balls, Shikhar Dhawan 16 runs in 20 balls, Cheteshwar Pujara 4 runs in 13 balls, Virat Kohli 28 runs in 40 balls, Rohit Sharma 10 runs in 30 balls, Wriddhiman Saha 8 runs in 19 balls and Hardik Pandya
 He was dismissed for just one run in 5 balls
 agar kisi ek ballebaaj ne pich par tikne kii koshish kii hoti to shaayad parinaam kuch or hote

 On the other hand, the entire ISI preparations behind the Amritsar grenade attack are almost clear
 punjab police intelligence ke sutron ke mutabik jis tarah se kashmir main pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ne aatankiyon ko hand grenade hamale ke liye taiyaar kiya or kai is tarah ke hamale hue, usee tarah amritsar main bhi hamalaa kiya gaya
 It is being said that now the ISI is trying to implement the same method in Punjab with the help of Khalistani terrorists
 punjab police ke intelligence sutron ke mutabik, hand grenade ko ek jagah se duusari jagah tak pahunchaana aasaan he or hand grenade se hone vaale blast kaa asar bhi itnaa hota he ki dhamaakaa ho jaae or kai log hataahat bhi
 In addition, training for the use of hand grenades is also provided to the local youth through social media and messenger apps

 Janata Dal United president Nitish Kumar has played a distant bet by not joining the Modi cabinet
 unka yah daanv agle saal bihar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bahut kaam aa saktaa he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has clearly stated that in future also his party will not join the Union Cabinet
 ye maan kar chaliye ki vidhansabha chunaav tak to isaki koi sambhaavna nahin hai
 However, Nitish Kumar, while dismissing any resentment from the Bharatiya Janata Party, said that in Bihar we are running the government together
 or 2020 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav par iskaa koi asar nahin hoga
 He said that the coalition is running in Bihar even before and even today
 modi cabinet main JDU nahin, kya vajah?nitish ke modi cabinet main sankethik bhagidaari ke prastaav ko naamanzoor karne ke peeche kii vajahen bahut vaazib hai
 The first is that a minister symbolically means joining the cabinet
 party ke andar manmutav kaa hona
 The second biggest reason is that the issues that the BJP has brought about this time in the elections cannot be opposed by joining the cabinet
 BJP-JDU ke bich muddon par matbhedbijapi or jediu ke bich kai muddon par matbhed he
 Promises made by the BJP during the Lok Sabha elections, whether it is Section 370 or 35A or the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code
 amit shah ke grih mantri banane ke baad ye to saaf hai ki modi sarkaar in muddon ke lekar kitni gambhir he
 While JDU and Nitish Kumar are avoiding these issues
 party ne chunaav ke aakhri charan ke matdaan ke dauraan to spasht kah diya tha ki in muddon par wo bijepi ke saath nahin he
 The BJP now has a steeper majority than 2014
 isliye party ke saamne in muddon ko puraa karne ke liye koi khaasi chunauti bhi nahin hogi
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar's situation could be quite uncomfortable
 wo jaanate hai ki agar in sab muddon kaa virodh karnaa mantrimandal main rah kar sambhav nahin he or agar mantrimandal se baahar aana pade to sthiti or bighad sakati he
 Therefore, he is constantly insisting that JDU is out in the Union Cabinet, but he is with NDA
 sarkaar se baahar rah kar hi in muddon kaa virodh to kiya ja saktaa he
 JDU does not want loss of secular image JDU in Bihar, out of the seats won by Lok Sabha Elections-2019, 9 seats are such that BJP lost in 2014 general elections
 un 9 siton main se 8 siten jediu ne is baar apana paracham laharaaya sirf ek seat kishanganj congress ke khate main gai
 Most of these seats are those on which there is a significant number of minorities
 isliye jediu nahin chaahati he ki uski secular chhavi ko nuksaan pahunche
 If the coalition changes based on the issues at the time of assembly elections, then there should be no problem in that also
 guuruuvaar ko jediu ke kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil hone kii charchaa chal rahi thi
 However, before the swearing-in ceremony, Nitish Kumar announced not to join the party's cabinet, stating that the bjp's offer to join the Modi-led ministry was a 'symbolic representation', which the JDU is not acceptable to
 unhone kaha tha ki party main sabaki raay he ki centre sarkaar main sankethik bhagidaari nahin chahie

 This is the reason why Rahul's RJD did not see any face except on the stage of Rahul at the first rally in Aurangabad

 This was speaking to Lalu's supporters, but Congress candidate Nikhil Kumar said very clearly that the party did not want to use the two big leaders together
 aurangabad auki sasaram kii wo siten hai jahaan lalu yadav kaa votbank congress ke liye phydemand he or bina lalu ke maai sameekaran kii ye siten jeetna bhi naammumkin he

 The meeting of AAP mlas has ended at the house of CM Arvind Kejriwal regarding the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill
 bill somvaar ko sadan main pesh kiya janaa he
 On the other hand, Prashant Bhushan, the expelled leader of the AAP, is about to protest against the bill
 prashanth bhushan ne di bahes kii chunautijis janalokapal se kejariwal dilli kii raajnneeti main chhaae, vah janalokapal unke dobaaraa mukhyamantri banane ke baad bhi unke peeche padaa he
 His old partner Prashant Bhushan has opened a front against him
 ek din pehle unhone dilli sarkaar ke janalokapal ko 'mahajokapaal' bataaya or is bill par khuli bahes kii chunauti de di
 Prashant Bhushan argues that according to the Anna movement, the Lokpal was an independent institution, but the government has a role in the selection committee of the Kejriwal government's Lokpal
 aitraaj is baat par bhi tha ki 2014 kaa lokapal bill saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya or prachaar kiya gaya ki ye vahi bill he
 'current bill completely different' Prashant Bhushan has said that contrary to the claims of Arvind Kejriwal government, the current Janlokpal bill of Delhi is completely different from the 2014 bill
 supreme court ke senior vakil prashanth bhushan ne daawa kiya ki 2015 kaa vidheyak lokapal kii niyukti or use hataane main sarkaar ke dakhal badhaata he or yah apane adheen centre sarkaar ke adhikariyon ko bhi laata he
 In view of the claims of Swaraj Abhiyan leader Prashant Bhushan, the AAP targeted him and alleged that his attack proved an alliance between him and the BJP
 kejariwal kii tulana hitler ke mantri se kiprashanth bhushan ne is daawey par bhadakte hue kejariwal kii tulana taanashaah hitler ke shashan main mantri rahe joseph goyables se kii
 With this, Bhushan challenged Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal to have an open discussion on the matter
 dilli sarkaar vidheyak ko somvaar ko pesh karegi
 Prashant Bhushan while presenting a comparative study of several Lokpal Bills and laws including the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill, 2014, Uttarakhand Lokayukta Bill, the Lokpal Law of the Center and the Jan Lokpal draft of Team Anna said that the Bill passed by the current Cabinet of Delhi is the worst

 dilli kii sadakon kii haalat kharaab he
 After the rains, there should be work to improve and rebuild roads in Delhi, but the people of Delhi are compelled to eat hiccups in the pits
 yahaan tak ki dilli kii life line kahi jane vaali ring road bhi badahaali main pahunch gai he, jise premium road bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is not difficult to guess what the condition of all the other roads will be
 ring road par vyast chauraahey, ashram ke paas sadak kaa bura haal he
 Attempts have been made to cover the pits at many places, but the entire road has been damaged in this round
 isi se thode aage lajpat nagar kaa fliover khatm hote hi gadde shuru ho jate hai
 Here is a part where it seems that the entire road has disappeared

 The same situation is near the Defense Colony Flyover, where the vehicles are hitchhiking as the road is broken or bumpy at every distance
 isi tarah kaa haal amuman puri dilli main he
 People say that every year the work of repairing roads starts after the monsoon, but this time not only the roads are getting worse, but no arrangement has been made to repair them yet
 ab iske peeche kii vajah bhi jaan lijie, to janaab sarkaar ke khazaane se sadakon ke liye paisa hi nahin nikal rahaa he
 Six months passed, but the government could not spend even a fifth of the budget that was set up for the construction of roads and flyovers
 jaahir he jab kaam ho hi nahin rahaa, to paisa kharch kahaan hoga
 Satish Upadhyay, president of bjp's Delhi unit, says that the government has been able to spend 18 percent because it seems that they have no interest in Delhi, given their priority
 yahaan tak ki dilli kii life line he ring road uski haalat kharaab he
 The road is full of potholes

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Indresh Kumar said that the surgical strike sent a message to Pakistan that India could enter Lahore at any time

 He said, 'we formed the government in Kashmir and we were also successful in doing three important things

 Indresh Kumar said, "we had to carry out operations in the coalition, 250 to 300 terrorists were killed
" sena, police, enie tathaa khufia beuro ko (aatankwaad) aarthik madad muhaiyaa karaane vaale netwart kaa safaya karne ke liye puri chhot di gai
 The RSS leader said that the surgical strike would not have been possible without the support of the Jammu and Kashmir government
 haalanki unhone pidipi kaa naam nahin liya
 He said, we did a surgical strike, it was a message to Pakistan that we can enter Lahore anytime, so be careful

 There has been a lot of change in the foreign policy of Pakistan in the last 4 years since the arrival of the Modi government in India
 ab maamla jaise ko taisa vaala he yaneepakistangar aatank kaa rasta nahin chodta he to usase kisi prakaar kii vaarta nahin hogi
 India has given a clear message that the 'pigeon blowing' policy will not be adopted in the name of peace
 aaie jaanate hai modi sarkaar ke wo paanch kadam jinase pakistan desh-duniya main alag-thalag pad gaya or use aatanki desh kaa tamgaa mil gaya
 Now Imran's government is compelled to leave the path of terror and be ready for talks
 pakistan ke khilaaf trump prashasamerica ke trump prashasan ne buudhvaar ko ahm aatank rodhi kadamon ke liye bharat kii tarif kii or kaha ki pakistani dehshatgard samooh bharat main apane hamale jari rakhe hue hai
 The US State Department released its annual report 'country Report on Terrorism' on Wednesday
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bhartiya netritv ne gharelu str par aatanki hamalon ko rokane or america va samaan vichaardhaara vaale deshon ke saath milakar aatank ke aakaaon ko insaaf ke kathghare main laane kaa sankalp jataayaa he
 The report said, "india has been under constant attack, both from Pakistani terrorist organizations and also from tribal and Maoists
" bhartiya adhikariyon ne pakistan kojammu-kashmiramen seemaa paar se hone vaale hamalon kaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 'this report can be considered a big victory for the Modi government of India because it has tried to give a clear message against Pakistan in the world
 america kii ore se aisi report pehle kabhi jari nahin hui jisamen pakistan ko sidhaa aatank kaa jimmedaar mana gaya
 After this report, the American assistance to Pakistan will be affected and Pakistan will seriously think about the policy of financing terrorism
 hijbul par america pratibandhbharat kii koshishon ke baad america nehijbul mujahidinko antarrashtriya aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiya
 Behind this was the complete preparation of the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi
 bharat sarkaar kii salaah par hijbul kii america main sari sampatti sil kar di gai
 Also, any transaction with this group was also banned
 yah bharat ke liye badi jeet thi kyonki kashmir main dehshatgardi ke liye yah sanghathan sabase zyada jimmedaar he
 This was seen as a major success for India's efforts to expose Pakistan in international fora against terrorism
 kashmir main aatankwaad ko badhaava dene main jute pakistan ke liye america kaa yah faisla kisi bade jatke se kam nahin tha
 After this decision, Hizbul's properties falling under the jurisdiction of the US and its associated operations were banned
 iske saath hi america kaa koi bhi vyakti is samooh ke saath kisi tarah kaa lenden nahin kar sakegaa
 After this step of Modi government, Masood Azhar, who often spewed openly poison about Kashmir, is now slowly getting lost in oblivion
 uski ek-ek harkaton par america or bharat kii khufia agenciyon kii nazren hai
 This move by the Government of India opened up Pakistan's fame in the world, how it has been raising terrorists like Masood Azhar
 yuan main 'techristaan'modi sarkaar kii aguai main pichley saal 22 sitambar ko aisa pehali baar hua jab sanyukt raashtra (yuan) main pakistan ko saream 'techristaan' kii sangya di gai
 Never before has Pakistan been lynched in the UN in so many words
 darasal, pichley saal sitambar main pakistan ke pradhanmantrishahid khaakaan abbasike jhooth par bharat ne palatwaar kiya
 India said that Pakistan is a stronghold of terrorists and the world does not need knowledge of Pakistan on human rights
 pakistan apni hi jameen par maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan karata rahaa he
 India also said that Pakistan should understand that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of us
 yuan main bharat kii pratham sachiv inam gambhir ne pakistan ko'techristaan' qaraar dete hue kaha ki vah lagaataar aatankiyon ko panaah detaa rahaa he
 This country is completely causing terror today
 yah asaadhaaran he ki ek desh jo osama bin laden or mullah umr ko panaah detaa he, peedit hone kaa dikhaava kar rahaa he
 Pakistan was isolated in SAARC, remember this incident exactly two years ago
 maamla saarc sammelan kaa tha jo pakistan main yojit hona tha
 India boycotted the SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad on the grounds that the country is synonymous with terror, there is no justification for the conference
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhishikhar sammelanamen shirkat nahin karne kaa faisla liya tha
 The issue of terrorist attack in Uri was the reason behind this strong move of India
 tatkaaleen videsh sachiv es jaishankar ne 18 sitambar ko hue uri hamale par pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ko doosraa demarsh jari kiya tha or aatanki hamale main ‘seemaa paar ke aatankakiyon’ kaa haath hone kaa saboot diya tha
 After the attack in Uri, the Modi government knew that a direct fight across is not possible, so some tricks had to be devised to expose Pakistan to the whole world
 bharat ne saarc ke chaar anya sadsy deshon ke saath is baithak main shariq nahin hone kaa faisla kiya
 The then Prime Minister of Pakistan was expecting to welcome the participation of SAARC leaders at the Sharif Conference
 sammelan ko safal banane ke liye sari taiyaariyaan ho gai thim lekin pradhanmantri modi kii ranneeti ne pakistan ko saarc main bhi alag-alag kar diya
 Apart from this, in the countries where Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited, he told the truth of Pakistan how he promotes terrorism
 saarc deshon ke saath bhi aisa hi hua or kai desh modi ke samarthan main aae or islamabad sammelan main shariq nahin hue
 Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib and India recently went to Congress leader and Punjab Minister Minjavot Singh Siddhupakistan
 mauka tha imran khan kii tajposhi kaa
 Sidhu brought a message from there that Pakistan wants to open the way to the famous Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib so that Sikh devotees of India can visit
 chunki maamla videsh mantralay kaa tha, isliye siddhu kaa isamen padane kaa koi tuk nahin tha
 Although talk of this alleged initiative of Pakistan arose, but the revelation of the Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh at the last moment revealed the reality of Pakistan
 general wike singh ne kaha ki pakistan se is tarah kaa koi prastaav nahin mila he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also reiterated VK Singh
 bharat kii is do took baat se pakistan ko yah spasht sandesh gaya ki videsh maamle hameshaa videsh mantralay ke str par hi sulajhaaye jaaenge na ki kisi netaa ke nijee daure se
 The new government of Pakistan-made Imran Khan negotiated in the name of Gurdwara Kartapur Sahib, which tried to start an informal round, the Indian government put a brake on it and said that there will be no change in India's policy unless Pakistan is a way of terror

 Earlier on May 13, diesel prices were increased
 daam main badhotaree se bijepi sarkaar ne spasht sanket de diya he ki vah purvavarti congress sarkaar ke sudhaaron ko jari rakhegi
 Significantly, in January 2013, the UPA government had decided to hike diesel prices by a nominal 50 paise every month
 yah nirnay us samay tak ke liye liya gaya tha, jab tak ki desh main dijal par sabsidi samaapt na ho jaae
 Oil companies have announced that this hike will be implemented from midnight tonight

 loksabhaa main bhoomi adhigrahan bill par do dinon tak chali charchaa ke baad aaj ise sadan ne paarit kar diya
 The government made nine amendments to the bill to break the political impasse
 congress, trinmul congress, vampanthi dal, rajd, sapa ne vidheyak ke paarit hone ke samay sadan se walkout kiya, jabaki biju janata dal ke sadsy vidheyak par khandwar charchaa ke dauraan hi walkout kar gaye the or shivasena ne matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 The nda's other party, the Swabhimani Paksha, introduced an amendment which was rejected
 sarkaar ne is vidheyak kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki usne puraane kanoon main 'aatma' daalkar ise gramin vikaas or kisaanon ke utthan kaa mahatvapurn madhyam banaaya he
 The government also assured that it is ready to adopt other suggestions given from any side including the opposition in favor of the farmers
 vipaksh ke kade virodh kaa saamana kar rahi sarkaar ne bich kaa maarg nikaalte hue, jahaan vipaksh evam sahyogi dalon kii kuch sujhaavon ko naye sanshodhano ke jariye vidheyak kaa hissaa banaaya or usamen do naye upbandh jode
 The Opposition, however, alleged that the government did not accept any of the amendments put on its behalf and neither did it accept its demand to send the bill to the Standing Committee
 sadan ne vipaksh kii ore se rakhe gaye sanshodhano ko asweekaar karte hue or sarkari sanshodhano ko manjuur karke 'bhoomi arjan, punarvaasan or punarravyasthaapan main uchit pratikar or paardarshita adhikaar sanshodhan vidheyak 2015' par apni muhar laga di
 The NDA government, which has an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, will now have to work hard to get this bill passed in the Rajya Sabha where it is in a minority and the opposition is united
 vipaksh kaa saath paane ke prayaas main gramin vikaas mantri ne aaj sadan main aashwaasan diya ki unhone pehle hi kuch naye sanshodhano ko laakar vipaksh or anya dalon kii chintaaon ko dur karne kii koshish kii he or kisaanon ke hiton main agar or bhi kuch suzav honge to sarkaar unhen bhi sweekaar karne ko taiyaar he
 While replying to the discussion in the Lok Sabha today, sometimes with sharp opposition with the members of the opposition and sometimes with humor, the Rural Development Minister urged it to be passed in the larger interest of the farmers and the country
 yah vidheyak is sambandh main jari adhyadesh kaa sthaan lene ke liye laayaa gaya he
 Government amendments define the Industrial Corridor in the Basic Law and make it clear that the acquisitions will be made by the government or on behalf of one of its boards
 audyogic galiyare kaa dayera rajmarg evam railway line ke ek kilometre tak hoga or kisi nijee ikai ko dene ke liye adhigrahan nahin hoga
 The minister said that we have removed the term social infrastructure so that it does not go away that after the acquisition one can open private institutions like college and hospital which is the business model
 vidheyak par charchaa ke dauraan mantri birendra singh kii congress ke jyotiraditya sindhiya or dipendar hooda ke saath takaraar hui or adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ko hastkshep karnaa padaa
 Several ministers including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, M
 Venkaiah Naidu were heard asking the Rural Development Minister to address the posture
 birendra singh ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar nayaa kanoon isliye laai he kyonki kisaan samrudh bane or uske bacchon ko acchhee shiksha evam suvidhaayen mili
 The minister said that section 24 of the law has been amended
 dhara 24 main kaha gaya he ki paanch saal main jameen par kaam nahin hota he tab use lautaa diya jayega
 Now it has been amended that if the work is not done in this period due to pending case in court then the period of suit will be reduced
 unhone ne kaha ki muaavja ke liye alag se nirdhaarit khaataa kholane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 He said that a new section 6 (a) has been added
 iske saath hi dhara 101 main praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki pariyojna puraa hone kii avadhi ko paanch varsh kii bajaae paanch varsh yaa pariyojna puri kii avadhi kii jaae lekin pariyojna puraa hone kii avadhi kaa nirdhaaran praadhikaar karegi kyonki kuch pariyojnaon ko paanch varsh main khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 The Rural Development Minister said that amending its section 105 has added all 13 central laws which were omitted in the 2013 law
 iske madhyam se kisaanon ko uchit muaavja dene ke saath punarvaas sunishchit karne kaa kaam kiya gaya he
 He said that we made eight amendments to the 2013 Basic Law, out of which four have no objection
 neshnal conference ke varisht netaa umr abdulla (omar Abdullah) ke us bayaan piem modi (PM Modi) ne pratikriya di he jisamen jammu-kashmir ke liye alag se piem (PM Modi) banane kii baat kahi gai thi
 PM Modi also surrounded the opposition Congress during this election by Omar Abdullah during an election rally
 unhone congress se poocha ki kya ve neshnal conference ke netaa (omar Abdullah) ke is bayaan kaa samarthan karte hai? piem modi(pm Modi) ne kaha ki umr abdulla chaahate hai ki jammu-kashmir ke liye alag se piem banaaya jaae
 i would like to seek clarification on this opinion of Omar from all his allies involved in the Grand Alliance
 wo sabhi bataaen ki kya vah umr ke is bayaan kaa samarthan dete hai
 It should be noted that in the backdrop of BJP leaders favoring the abolition of Article 370, Abdullah had mentioned Jammu and Kashmir being a separate Prime Minister years ago and restoring the state for its protection
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataae jane ko lekar rajya kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne bhi tippanee kii thi
 He said a few days ago that if this happens then we will have to rethink whether we have to live with India or not
 mahabuuba mufti ne (mehbooba Mufti) vitt mantri arun jetali par palatwaar karte hue shanivaar ko kaha tha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko yadi khatm kiya gaya to bharat sangh or rajya ke bich sambandh samaapt ho jayega
 Mehbooba Mufti told party workers at his residence that Arun Jaitley should understand this
 yah kahana aasaan nahin he
 If you finish (article) 370, then your relations with Jammu and Kashmir will end
 arun jetali ne guuruuvaar ko jammu kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne kii vakaalat karte hue kaha tha ki anuchhed 35e jo jammu-kashmir main gaiyr-sthaayee nivaasiyon ko sampatti kharidne par roak lagaataa he vah ‘sanvaidhanik rup se doshapurn' he or rajya ke aarthik vikaas ko baadhit kar rahaa he
 Mehbooba had said that Article 370 is a bridge between the Union of India and the state and if special provisions of the Constitution were scrapped, New Delhi would have to 'renegotiate' its relations with Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha tha ki yadi aapane bharat ke samvidhan main hamen ek vishesh darja diya he or aap us darje ko todate hai tab hamen punarvichaar karnaa hoga ki kya ham aapke saath bina shart rahanaa bhi chaahate hai yaa nahin

 Mehbooba Mufti had said in a tweet that in today's era it is necessary to save the patriotic chair
 unhone (mehbooba Mufti) apane twit main bollywood kii ek film kaa video bhi daalaa tha
 In which two artists were talking about how they can win elections in the name of patriotism

 ishwar unke parivaar ko dukh sahane kii shakti de— Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan)may 13, 2016 According to mythology, Abhimanyu had learned to create and enter the chakravyuh in the womb itself, but these teachers of modern Bihar have even left Abhimanyu behind
 bihar ke saharsa main ek sarkari skool main shikshak elbi singh kaa janm janvari 1986 main hua tha
 But you will be surprised to see his b
ed
 degree
 inhone apane janm se 7 saal pehle 1979 main hi bied kii degree hasil kar lee thi
 It is not that LB Singh is the only teacher in Bihar who has the qualities of Abhimanyu
 yahaan to aise teachers kii bharmaar he
 Indu Kumari of Saran had also completed her b

 7 years before her birth
 madhepura ke shivnarayan yadav or priti kumari ne janm se teen-teen saal pehle bied kii degree hasil kii, jabaki purvi champaran ke tarakeshwar prasad janm se 5 saal pehle hi teacher banane kii yogyata hasil kar chuke the
 Out of the total 32,127 teachers admitted in march-april 2012, at least 95 are those who had done bed before birth
 2010 main supreme court ne aadesh diya tha ki bihar sarkaar 21 saal tak kii umr se pehle jin 34,540 logon ne bied kii he, unhen teacher ke rup main bhartee kiya jaae
 The state government has made these appointments since the Supreme Court's decision
 2003 main esayssi ne ye bhartiyon nikaali thim, lekin tatkaaleen argedy sarkaar ne niyukti nahin di
 Sources in the Bihar HRD ministry told Indian Express that out of the 32,127 people recruited, at least 3000 teachers got jobs based on fake documents
 jin logon kaa sillection nahin hua unki shikaayat par june 2012 main jaanch shuru hone ke baad ab tak farji dastavej par bhartee hone vaale 306 teachers ko barkhaast kar diya gaya he
 In Bihar, in order to teach from first class to 8th, the candidate must have a b
ed
 degree apart from graduation
 agar kinhin do logon ke paas ek jaisi degree ho, to unamem se jisane pehle bied kii ho use naukari di jaati he
 In Bihar, each such regular teacher gets a salary of 32 thousand rupees
 bihar ke vaishali or gopalganj se 39-39 teachers ko barkhaast kiya gaya he, jabaki camoor se 36 aise teachers apni naukari ganvaa chuke he

 Mayawati's total assets in 2010 were 88 crores, which has now risen to Rs 111 crores

 If you are a woman and you have a Facebook account, then this news is for you
 kyonki aapako filmi andaaj vaale riki bahal se hoshiyaar rahanaa hoga, jo karodpati hone ke saath hi behad chaalaak or smart bhi he
 He implicates gullible women through Facebook and loots everything from them as Ricky Bahl
 ji haa, gajiabad police ke hathe chadha he ek fasebuk thag
 The accused used to trap people through Facebook and used to cheat crores of rupees from them in the name of a game
 raghubir singh naam kaa ye aaropee karodpati he or uski thagi kaa jaal desh bhar main failaa he
 According to police, his latest victim is a woman named Devika
 gujarat kii rahane vaali devika se raghubir ne uski jindagi bhar kii kamai kareeb 1 karod 10 lakh rupee thag liye
 Actually, he sent Devika the first Friendship Request on Facebook
 dhire-dhire donon main dosti ho gai
 He then asked Devika to play an online game
 jab vah jeet gai to uraghubir ne usase kaha ki wo use kareeb 30 lakh rupee de to wo use jeet kii rakam 40 lakh rupee degaa
 After this, he called Devika to Ghaziabad and it is alleged that here he mixed her with tea and drank the intoxicating substance and cheated her
 baad main teen baar mahila se kareeb ek karod se zyada kii thagi hui
 But when the woman felt that her money would not be returned, she filed a police complaint
 police kii maane to raghubir isi tarah kai logon ko thag chukaa he
 He has made most of the women his victims
 police ne devika kii shikaayat par use giraftaar kar liya he
 Although fond of expensive vehicles, the accused has described himself as innocent
 dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijendra gupta ne aarope lagaaya he ki siem arvind kejariwal ne yoga par bhi raajnneeti nahin chodi or yoga diwas kaa boycott kiya he
 Vijendra Gupta alleged that the Yoga Day was celebrated by the whole world, but the Yoga program was not organized by the Government of Delhi on such a great achievement of the country, nor did they participate in any event organized by the Government of India
 gupta ne kaha ki ye jaanakar dukh hua ki dilli sarkaar ne yoga diwas ko puri tarah se nazarandaaj kar diya
 The BJP leader said that crores of people from all over the world did yoga on this occasion
 lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or unke mantriyon ne yoga ke kaarykram main bhaag nahin liya
 Gupta alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party has also politicized yoga and by doing so Kejriwal has introduced a narrow mindset
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki antarrashtriya yoga diwas par rajpath par yojit mukhya kaarykram main kejariwal ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha jisamen hazaron logon ne bhaag liya
 But the Chief Minister of Delhi and his ministers stayed away from the program of Yoga Day, while Kejriwal was present in Delhi at the time of the program
 lekin na kejariwal khud aae or na hi unhone apni sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv karne kisi mantri ko bheja
 When Vijender Gupta was referred to Kejriwal's health, he said that if Kejriwal was unwell, he could send any of his ministers as a representative
 lekin aisa nahin kar ke unhone yoga diwas par bhi raajnneeti kar di
 Let us tell you that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal did not participate in the program on Rajpath on the occasion of International Yoga Day
 sirf kejariwal hi nahin balki unke mantrimandal se koi bhi nahin pahunchaa
 The President, Vice President and Prime Minister all three stayed out of Delhi on the fourth International Yoga Day
 bataa den ki dedh ghanta se zyaada samay tak rajpath par chale samaaroh main uparajyapal anil baijal ne puure samay shirkat kii

 Initial investigations by the police revealed that the accused were also threatening to make the victim's video viral
 police (hyderabad Police) ke anusaar peedita ne giraftaar kiye gaye teen logon ke saath saath ek gavaah sahit aath logon par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 After this incident came to the fore, people also protested in many places
 ladki kii ore se shikaayat darj karaae jane ke baad police ne 31 disambar ko ladki ke ek rishtedaar sahit teen logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The girl later alleged that eight more people had sexually assaulted her
 isamen ek gavaah bhi he
 Assistant Commissioner of Police b Anjaiah (charminar Division) said that in view of the new allegations and to ensure a better investigation, a woman police officer of ACP rank has been given the responsibility of investigating
 gauratlab he ki samuhik dushkarm kii yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he
 Earlier in Delhi's Narela area, a 12-year-old girl was abducted and gangraped by three boys in a luggage-carrying tempo
 jaankaree milane par police ne narela ilaake main tempo ko gher kar ladki ko aropiyon ke jangul se chhudaaya tha
 According to police, there were three boys in the tempo, out of which one boy escaped from the spot, while two were caught there
 baad main tisare aaropee ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The police identified the accused as Ravi, Mohit and Vinod
 police ke mutabik ladki narela kii jhuggiyon main rahati thi or aaropee ladki ke padosi the
 All the accused were produced in the court by the police
 jahaan se court ne unhen 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya tha
 a woman who was approached by the democrat in want of a son was gang-raped
 ghatana baxur kii he jabaki mahila utarapradesh kii rahane vaali he
 The victim has filed a case against five nominees and an unidentified man at the Buxar Mahila police station
 police ne abtak do aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The victim woman said in her statement that she had come to chauffeur near Chausa Bramhachaura in Mufassil police station area
 isi dauraan paanch namjad, tathaa 1 anya agyaat shaks ne uske gale par chaaku rakh kar apane kabje main liya, phir ganga ke paas jhaadi main le jaakar samuhik dushkarm kii ghatana ko anjaam diya
 It is being told that in the desire of the son, the woman used to come to Brahm place for the last 3 years to get her to brush
 ravivaar bhi vah jhaad phoonk ke liye brahm sthaan par pahunchi thi jahaan der ho jane ke kaaran raat main ruk gai, jahaan uske sathgangrepakia
 The accused threatened the woman that if she told this to anyone, she would kill her husband
 mahilauttar pradeshke gajipur jile kii rahane vaali he
 Reserve Superintendent Upendra Nath Verma said that as soon as the incident was reported, two accused have been arrested in the joint action of the police station and the Mufasil police station and raids are being conducted continuously to arrest the others
 unhone bataaya ki mahila ko medical jaanch ke liye bheja gaya he
 At the same time, police is also involved in the investigation keeping various points in mind
 unhone kaha kigangrape ke aaropekisi bhi surat main bakhshae nahin jaaenge
 There were very few people in the lap of Ganga that day
 aas-paas se do-chaar naaven guzar raheen thim
 Each boat carried thirty to thirty-five people, with wrinkles in their faces stating that they came from the same section, whose wish for liberation, Vivekananda wept in his room on the night of September 11, 1893, when his speech in the Parliament of Religions He was made world famous
 rote hue vivekanand ne kaha tha, "oh maa! naam or prasiddhi lekar main kya karuunga, jab meri mathrubhumi atyant garib he
 
 
 Who will raise the poor of India
 
 
 ? koun unhen roti degaa
 
 
 The Hey mother Show me the way, how do i help them? 
 
 ?" If the fare was more than ten rupees, these people might not even be able to take a boat ride from Dakshineswar to Belur Math
 belur math ke ghat par utarate hi ek khaas kism kii saadagi ne swaagat kiya
 Perhaps this will be the previous route to enter Belur Math
 do-chaar chaay-samose or khilone ke thele lage the
 Turning towards Belur Math, a tomb showed
 pani kii bottlen bik rahi thim or andar koi gatividhi nahin
 On going inside, we came to know that this tomb has been present here for four hundred years
 kisi pir kaa he, jo duniya kii nazaron se dur apane tareeke se bharat ko samaj rahaa hoga
 Vivekananda also has a tomb nearby
 kya pataa, donon aaj bhi ganga kii laharon ko sakshi maan samvaad karte honge ki dharm ko lekar log vahashi kyon ho gaye hai
 i entered the monastery as there was no suitable person for further inquiry
 swami ramakrishna mandir ke baahar khadaa guide angrezi main vivekanand ke bare main bataa rahaa tha
 Swami ji has constructed this temple by taking positive things from all places and religions
 is mandir kii vaastukala ko dekhie
 Parts of the mosque, church, Buddhist stupa will be found in it
 vivekanand ne is mandir kaa dizine taiyaar karne ke liye bharat kaa bhraman kiya tha
 It was the essence of all religions
 guide kii baton se itar maine bhi khub nihara mandir ko
 Truly an excellent piece of architecture, and perhaps a departure point as well
 adbhut! Next to the temple is the Vivekananda Museum
 unke kapade-juute sab rakhe hai
 There are many tableaux related to life
 ham sab jaldi-jaldi ghumkar nikal aate hai
 Who knows what is going on in his mind? vaataavaran main ek shanti to he, magar vichaar karne kaa avasar nahin
 Belur Math has turned into a tourist destination
 vivekanand jeevanabhar bharat or dharm ke saar ko samajhate rahe, lekin yahaan bharat-bhar se log bharat ko samajhane ke liye nahin, vivekanand ke aakarshan ke kaaran aae hai
 One and a half years later, such an interest in Vivekananda is a pleasant surprise
 mandir or musium ke baad main isi parisar main maujuud sahitya centre main pravesh karata hum
 Wherever the eye stops within the shop, literature exists in the name of Vivekananda or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 donon ke vichaaron ko vargeekaran kar alag-alag naam se packaging kii gai he
 What would Vivekananda have done if he had got a chance to build this literary repository like a temple
 veydant, hindu dharm, bhartiyata, rashtriyata jaise sheershakon main khud ko sajaa dekh vivekanand kii kya pratikriya hoti
 It was not good to see the market classification and formulation of the totality of his ideas
 zarur vivekanand apane naam par bane is sahitya centre main apni aalochana kii kitaaben bhi rakhte
 There would have been more literature around the world on religion and culture, so that his followers would understand religion and culture in a holistic way, not returning from here knowing Vivekananda as the pioneer of Hinduism
 jis mahaan shaks ne belur kaa mandir banane ke liye puure vishwa kii samskritiyon, vaastukalaon kaa sangrah kiya ho, vah kaise is parisar main sirf apane vichaaron kii kitabon ko rakhana pasand karte yaa apane upar kii gai sakht aalochanaon ko bhi jagah dete
 The Vivekananda that i read and knew as much as i could not have
 kuch kitaaben thim, jo vivekanand se itar thim, par zyaadaatar kitabon ke naam se laga ki unhone jis chintan style ko dhakka diya tha, vah ab chhapakar jad ho gai he
 His words have become the literature of his propaganda only
 nai baton ke avishkaar kaa sahitya nahin mila
 i bought many books from there
 vivekanand ko padhanaa mujhe acha lagata he
 When he returned home and started reading, he got part of the previous book in every book
 shaq hua ki ek hi kitaab to baar-baar nahin pard rahaa hum
 By storing his ideas here and there, a repository of Vivekananda literature is being created with different names
 hindu dharm, veydant or bhartiya vyaakhyaan, buddha dharm or chaatro ke liye
 In books printed with the category of these names, their thinking on Vedanta comes from somewhere
 raajnneeti main bhi yahi dekhtaa hum
 In the name of Vivekananda, people cut the front and back lines from their thoughts and make quotes
 vivekanand ke vichaar kam, unke kots zyada lokapriy ho gaye hai
 He has been imprisoned in posters
 unhen sandarbhon se katkar kots main badal diya gaya he
 Posters have been shielded
 ek sanyasi, jo yathasthiti ko jhakzor dena chahta tha, use aaj kii raajnneeti ne yathasthiti main dhaal diya he
 Vivekananda is being introduced as a formula
 mere liye vivekanand kaa matlab he, har us sawaal ko saahas se uthaanaa, jise ham dharm kii satta se darkar chhod dete hai
 i have many books on Vivekananda
 main vivekanand ko lekar communiston kii tarah duvidha main nahin hum or na hi dakshinpanthiyon kii tarah unka andhbhakt, kyonki vivekanand ne mujhe yah nahin sikhaaya he
 He was opposed to the priesthood, openly attacked Brahminism, wanted to open Sanskrit, literature and temples to the Dalits
 unhone hindu dharm ko gauravanvit kiya to yah bhi kaha ki kisi bhi dharm kaa ekadhikaar thik nahin he
 The monopoly goes on
 aaj raajnneeti main khud ko unka pratinidhi bataane vaale bhi brahmanwad par hamalaa nahin kar sakate
 Many did not like even the slightest criticism of the film 'PK'
 vivekanand kaa matlab he khulkar sochna or saahas se kahana
 Is this possible in today's political, social and religious system
 pehla virodh vivekanand kaa poster lagane vaale hi karenge
 "in summary of all the satvic and spiritual exercises, it is true that i am pure and all others are impure
 
 
 kitna pashutvpurn daanvi or naarkeey vichaar he yah
 
 
 "if the followers of Vivekananda had understood the heart of this, i would not have bothered to take prasad in the temple premises
 main sookhaa prasad lene ke liye line main khadaa ho gaya
 When my turn came, i extended my left hand due to being left-handed
 prasad dene vaale ne virakti bhav se dekha or bina kahe ankhon ko band kar baayen haath ko hataa lene kaa ishaara karne laga
 Like when Prasad has become impure on taking Prasad with left hand
 apane saath hue is bartaav se main sihar uthaa
 Vivekananda had called the notion of desecration of caste and religion among human beings a brutal idea, but how this idea has got a place in his premises
 yahi hoga, agar ham vivekanand ko formula banaakar bechate rahenge
 How many people today attack Varna-system, caste-system against the words of Vivekananda against impurity
 koi varna-vyavastha or jatvaad ke khilaaf kaam nahin karata
 Candidates choose in the name of Jat and ask for votes in the name of India
 vivekanand ko party yaa kisi dharm kaa pratik mat banaaie
 Their criticism should find a place and their use should also be questioned
 vivekanand dharmik or aarthik shoshan - donon ke khilaaf the
 "in 1928-29, a book titled 'vivekananda - The Socialist' was published by Dr
 Bhupendranath Dutt, Anuj of Swami Vivekananda
 
 
 1927 main bhagatsingh or unke saathiyon ne noujvaan sabha ke ek kaarykram main pashchim main krantikariyon kii dasha naamak vishay par sambodhan ke liye bulaayaa tha
 
 
 The orthodox Hindus frowned upon this book, because for them Vivekananda was nothing more than the mystic Vedanti
 
 
 " (vivekanand kaa jandharm - kanak tiwari) Vivekananda's Hindu religion was not political Hindutva
 vivekanand ne baar-baar kaha he ki main hindu shabd kaa prayog nahin karuunga
 We will use the word Vedic or Vedantic, which is even better
 'ekan sadwipra bahudhaa vadanti' - vivekanand ne is sutara vaakya ko baar-baar doharaaya he ki satya ek he, magar vyakhyaayein anant
 Whether different interpretations of Vivekananda's ideas are offered
 kahin ham vivekanand ke naam se darane to nahin lage hai yaa koi daraa to nahin rahaa he
 "if every man's religious opinion becomes one and everyone starts to follow the same path, then it will be a very bad day for the world
 
 
 tab to sab dharmon ke saare vichaar nasht ho jaaenge
 
 
 Vibhinya is the root of life
 
 
 " i would like to conclude with this talk of Vivekananda
 hindi ke mashhoor kavi sooryakanth treepathi niraala ne anuwaad kiya he, jise nagpur math ne 'swami vivekanand – bhartiya vyaakhyaan' ke naam se chapa he
 This sentence is also necessary for those who want to give the whole national identity a religious identity
 pahachaanon ko dharmik naam dene kaa matlab hi he vividhta ko khatm karnaa
 In the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, Ajay and Yashpal have been granted anticipatory bail by the Gujraj High Court
 in donon kaa naam sibiai kii chargeshit main tha
 Significantly, in the Sohrabuddin encounter case, a special CBI court had issued non-bailable warrants against absconding accused Ajay Patel and Yashpal Chudasama
 unhone agrim jamaanat ke liye sibiai seshans court main araji daakhil kii thi
 The court said that there are serious charges against both and non-bailable warrants have also been issued
 isliye unhen agrim jamaanat nahin di ja sakati
 It is noteworthy that Ahmedabad District Bank chairman Ajay Patel and Yashpal Chudasama have been declared accused by the CBI in the Sohrabuddin case

 Prosecution sources said that the bail application of the former Cooperative Minister was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in-charge (CJM) Ashutosh Khaitan
 adaalat main aatmasamarpan ke baad singh ne jamaanat arji di thi jise asweekaar kar diya gaya

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has filed an answer in the Supreme Court in the contempt case related to Rafale Deal
 supreme court dwaara rafel maamle main die gaye aadesh par tippanee karne ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf BJP saansad minakshi lekhi dwaara daayar kii gai avmaananaa yachika par congress adhyaksh ne affidavit daakhil kiya
 At the same time, the central government has asked for some more time to file an answer on Rafale
 avmaananaa maamle main puraani daleel ko hi rahul gandhi ne aadhaar banaaya he
 Earlier, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had filed his explanation in the Supreme Court in the case of remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rafale case and regretted his statement 'chowkidar Chor Hai'
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mana tha ki supreme court ne nahin kaha tha ki chaukeedaar chor he
 Explaining his statement in the Supreme Court, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had said that this statement came out of his mouth in excitement during the election campaign
 rahul gandhi ne supreme court main anderteking di he thiki wo apane bhaashan yaa raajnneetik bayaanbaji main court ke hawaale se koi bhi vichaar, tippanee yaa finding nahin denge jab tak ki wo court dwaara ricard naa kii gai hon
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi filed a reply in the Supreme Court on the petition of Meenakshi Lekhi on the statement of 'chowkidar Chor' on PM Modi in the Rafale case
 rahul gandhi ne jawaab main kaha he ki court kii avmaananaa karnaa kabhi unka makasad yaa manshaa nahin rahi
 He said that during the excitement of the election campaign, the decision of the Supreme Court in the Rafael Review case came, during which the reaction came out of his mouth
 lekin virodhiyon ne unke bayaan ko tod marod kar or galat manshaa se project kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi also said that his statement in the media that 'the Supreme Court has agreed that PM Modi has committed corruption in the Rafale deal' was against the statements in which his opponents have been saying since December 14 that the Supreme Court Has given a clean chit
 unhone kaha ki "chaukeedaar chor he" kaa naaraa lagaataar unke chunavi abhiyaan kaa hissaa rahaa he
 In fact, while hearing the contempt petition of BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, on 15 April, the Supreme Court had said that we want to make it clear that what the respondent has quoted to the Supreme Court is wrong
 court ne aisi koi tippanee nahin kii thi or court ke saamne aisi tippanee kaa koi avasar bhi nahin tha kyonki us vakt sirf dastavej kii sweekaaryata par faisla lenaa tha
 The Supreme Court had asked Rahul to file a reply by 22 April and had asked for a hearing on 23 April
 rafel maamle main bijepi saasand minakshi lekhi kii yachika par supreme court ne sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 Lekhi has filed a contempt petition against Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on PM Modi
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne rafel maamle main punarvichaar yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan centre kii praarambhik aapatti khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki wo da hindu main chape raksha dastavej par vichaar karegaa
 But Congress President Rahul Gandhi quoted the Supreme Court as saying that the Supreme Court has also accepted that the watchman is a thief
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki court ne aadesh main aisa kuch nahin he isliye ye court kii avmaananaa he
 The Congress President in his constituency Amethi had said, “I want to thank the Supreme Court
 puraa desh kah rahaa he ki chaukeedaar chor he (chaukeedaar ne chori kii he)
 It is a celebration day that the Supreme Court has spoken of justice

 bumraah se pehle yah record venkatapati raju ke naam tha, jinhone 1990 main srilanka ke khilaaf chandigarh main 12 ran dekar 6 wicket chatkaaye the
 Jasprit Bumrah has done this feat for the fourth time in an innings of a Test match when he has taken five or more wickets
 unako yah uplabdhi chaar alag-alag dauron main hasil hui he
 He achieved this feat on tour to South Africa, England, Australia and now the West Indies
 bumraah bharat hi nahin, asia ke pehle aise gendbaaj ban gaye hai, jo in chaar deshon ke har daure main paanch wicket liye hai
 Just look at the bowling of Bumrah, his body language while flying and taking a run
 kisi bhi tej gendbaaj kii banisbat unka ran ap chota he par teji kam nahin
 And the faster the balls, the more accurate the balls
 khaskar yorker
 India has got an edge in bowling
 mohammad shami bhale hi paramparki andaaj main gendbaaji karte hai lekin vah ek chor par ballebaajon kii nakel daale rahete hai
 Apparently, after that Boomrah continues to send the batsman to the pavilion with the sharp balls like his nose
 ishanth kii swing or jadeja kii spin apane tareeke se ran roke rahete hai
 Taking five wickets at one time may not be such a big deal, but if the captain repeatedly catches the ball to Bumrah in a difficult time, then the importance of his role in the field becomes clear
 buumrah par vishwaas isliye bhi he ki vah sirf raftaar kii saudagari nahin karte
 The balls are also accurate and they roll in the air
 amuman unki gend tappa khaane ke baad kanta bhi badalati he
 Whether the wicket is of Indian conditions or heavy weather on foreign soil, Bumrah has given speed and rotation to both red and white balls according to his mind
 par buumrah ne cricket ke teenon formet main apni gendbaaji se chamatkrit kiya he
 In the coming days, Indian cricket will keep an eye on them but will also blindly trust them
