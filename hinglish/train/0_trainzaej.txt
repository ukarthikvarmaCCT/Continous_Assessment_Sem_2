 Even Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi held some meetings in the last round of campaigning

 aakhir imran khan ke UN campagne kaa sach kya he?india today open sorce intelegence ne isaki padtaal keepakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke haalia america daure ko unke samarthak kisi bhi pakistani piem kaa sabase safal videshi campagne bataa rahe hai
 Imran is facing a lot of criticism in his country for not doing anything when the provisions of Article 370 are removed from Jammu and Kashmir by the Government of India
 aise main america main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha (UNGA) ke 74wein satr ke dauraan imran ke campagne ko lekar jo shorgul khadaa kiya gaya usase pakistani piem ko kam se kam apane desh kii andruni raajnneeti main kuch raahat kii saans lene kaa mauka mila he
 One of the aspects publicized about Khan's United Nations campaign was that there was 'pakistan friendly' coverage in the US and the global press about his campaign
 india today open sorce intelegence (OSINT) jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki is campagne ke dauraan pakistan kii ore se kya taur-tareeke or hatkande apanaae gaye
 An organization named 'international Humanitarian Foundation Inc
' (IHF) was shown on the front foot by fake ngopakistani campaign which had not been heard much before
 iskaa naam pehali baar surkhiyon main tab aayaa jab 22 sitambar ko huston ke enarji stadium ke baahar bharat-virdohi pradarshan ke mukhya aayojak ke taur par ye dikhaa
 On 27 September, the IHF reported a full-page ad in the New York Times, according to the New York Times ad rates, which would have cost the IHF a million dollars for this one ad
 IHF kaa naam aisa he jisase iske gaiyr munaafe vaala antarrashtriya maanviya sahaayta group kaa bhram hota he, lekin IHF kaa koi maanviya sahaayta vaala kaam ateet main nahin dikhaa
 According to information collected by India Today from the tax collection, the IHF was formed a month before PM Modi's visit to Houston
 iske alaava IHF kii website ko lekar WHOIS domen ke jariye khangala gaya to pataa chalaa ki ye website sirf 36 din puraani (30 sitambar tak) hi nikali
 Vigilance was taken by the Foundation to not show any kind of affiliation with the Government of Pakistan
 yahi dikhaaya gaya ki wo gaiyr munafakari global humanterian sanghathan he
 The PR firm's us-based platform o'dwyer PR reported that IHF contracted with US PR company Fenton Communications for $ 50,000
 o'dwyer PR plateform america main piaar companiyon kii ranking prakashit karata he
 Imran Khan also had a meeting with David Fenton, founder of Fenton Communications, during a visit to New York, according to a report in Pakistani newspaper Dawn
 imran ke kareebi the parde ke pichhechau'dwyer kii report main ye daawa bhi kiya gaya ki IHF ko imran kii party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) ke numaayinde hi sanchalit kar rahe hai
 Atif Iqbal Khan's name came to light when India Today OSINT researched open source data
 iqbaal par pitiai ke huston chapter ke adhyaksh kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Iqbal also posted a message on his social media page thanking the designer who designed the advertisement published in the New York Times on short notice, linking with the Pakistan Army, though many people associated with Imran's political party have been associated with the campaign everywhere But, the role of a person was seen as important and that is by the Pakistan Association of Greater Houston (PAGH) The Sident Mian Nazir
 huston me pakistan house bhi miyaan nazir kii ore se hi chalaaya jaataa he
 Mian Nazir has no direct connection with PTI, but a phone number without a name has been given on the official website of IHF, which turned out to be Mian Nazir
 miyaan nazir ne neuyork times main vigyaapan prakashit hone kii taarikh se ek din pehle hi us vigyaapan ke draft ko post kiya
 Mian Nazir was also seen during the anti-india protest outside NRG Stadium
 huston ke sthaayee nivasee miyaan nazir ko pakistan main sena ke exclusive klbon me paak sena ke adhikariyon ke saath dinar main bhi hissaa lete dekha gaya
 During the 12 days, more than one and a half million dollars were spent on advertising and PR (public relations) by IHF
 iske alaava huston or neuyork main ‘free park and ride’ jaisi anya chizon par hue kharch ko bhi joda jaae to tathakthith maanviya sahaayta sanghathan IHF kaa kharch dugana baith jaataa he
 Funding of this campaign towards the governmental structure in Pakistan, it was taken care that the name of any local chapter or business forum with its known affiliations should not be revealed
 aisa ye dikhaane ke liye kiya gaya ki kashmir kaa mudda vaishvik maanviya chintaa ke taur par dikhe or UNGA campagne ke dauraan kukhyat pakistani tag kahin usase judaa naa dikhe
 So, this year, 'pyaar Ka Panchnama 2', 'kis-kis Ko Pyaar Karoon', 'drisham', 'NH 10', 'dum Lagaake Haisha' and 'badlapur' were also hits, but they earned 'brothers'

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government is going to give a big gift to the farmers
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ravivaar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke garh gorakhpur main 'pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana' kii shuruyaat karenge
 Under this, the Prime Minister will release the first installment of 2000 rupees in the account of 12 crore farmers of the country
 is yojana kii shuruyaat karne se pehle piem modi ne shanivaar ko ek twit kiya
 He said that yesterday (sunday) is a historic day
 'pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana' kii shuruyaat gorakhpur se hogi
 This is a scheme that will give wings to the aspirations of the crores of hardworking farmers of India who support our country
 bataa den ki modi sarkaar ne antarim bajet main kisaanon ko lekar bada faisla liya tha
 The government had announced 'pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana' for farmers
 is yojana ke tahat desh ke 12 karod kisaanon ko unki fasal ke liye salanaa 6 hajaar rupee di jaaegi
 6000 rupees to be paid by the government to farmers will be directly transferred to the account in 3 installments
 is yojana kaa laabh un kisaanon ko milegaa jinke paas do hectare yaa usase kam jameen he
 General elections are due in the country after the first installment to be released on Sunday

 How much the government's gift will translate into votes, they will only tell the results after the election
 lekin usase pehle modi sarkaar ke is kadam ko gemeanger mana ja rahaa he
 The resentment of the farmers was also a reason for the defeat in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 aise main sarkaar ek baar phir kisaanon ko apane paale main laane ke liye ye bada daanv chali he
 While another government is patting its back on this plan, the Congress is leaving no chance to attack the government
 is yojana ke elaan hote hi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sidhe sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa tha
 He termed the government's decision to give Rs 17 daily to the farmers as an insult to the farmers
 36 karod matadaata hai targetbata den ki jinako iskaa laabh milegaa wo sirf ek kisaan nahin hai wo ek voter bhi hai
 They will also vote in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 12 karod kisaanon kaa matlab he kareeb 36 karod matadaata
 Experts believe that by bringing this scheme, the government has tried to show that it has done something big for the farmers

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) ko ek lakh karod rupee kaa sarkari order dene ke maamle main raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman par sansad main 'jhooth' bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue ravivaar ko kaha ki vah sadan main apane bayaan ke samarthan main yaa to dastavej pesh karen yaa istipha den
 On this statement of Rahul, the Defense Minister retorted that it is a matter of shame that the Congress President is misleading the country without fully understanding the issue
 unhone rahul ko jawaab dete hue echeel se deal se dastavej bhi die
 The defense minister tweeted in this regard and was told when and how much money was saved from HAL
 raksha mantri ke karyaalay ke aadhikarik handle par sitaraman ne kaha, 'echeel ne 2014 se 2018 ke bich 26,570
 8 crore contracts have been signed and contracts worth Rs 73,000 crore are to be signed
 kya rahul gandhi sadan ke patal se desh se maafee maangenge ?'it's a shame that the president of@incindiais spreading lies ndmisleading the country
 HAL has signed contracts worth 26570
 8cr (between 2014 & 2018) nd contracts worth 73000cr are in the pipeline

 com / prwemfujml — nsitharamanoffice (@nsitharamanoffc) January 6, 2019 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi accused the Defense Minister after a media report claimed that 'HAL has not received a single rupee out of one lakh crore rupees
 
 daawey ke vipareet ab tak ek bhi order par hastakshar nahin kiye gaye hai
 'rahul Gandhi tweeted and wrote,' When you tell a lie, you have to lie more to hide the lie first
 piem ke rafel jhooth kaa bachaav karne kii utsukata main, raksha mantri ne sansad main jhooth bolaa
 Tomorrow, the defense minister will have to show the government orders of 1 lakh crore to HAL before the documents of Parliament
 yaa istipha den
 'let me tell you that the Congress is alleging that the present government had made Rafale deal with Anil Ambani instead of HAL and benefited them
 jabaki modi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki unke raaj main echeel ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya gaya he
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while clarifying the allegations related to Rafael Deal in Parliament, had said that there are frequent defense deals with HAL
 daawa kamjor hua to maanga jayega istifasitharaman ke daawey par congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki yadi sitaraman sansad main apane is daawey kii pushti karne main vifal rahati hai ki echeel ko ek lakh karod rupee ke anubandh diye gayi to congress unke istife ke liye dabaav banaaegi
 He said that if the government was claiming that it had given contracts worth crores of rupees to HAL, then why did it have to borrow to pay its employees
 bataa den ki haal hi main ek media report main yah daawa bhi kiya gaya he ki echeel ko apane karmchaariyon ko selary dene ke udhaar lenaa pad rahaa he
 HAL has said on this that the company has taken an overdraft of Rs 962 crore
 march tak raashi main vruddhi ke anumaan se rakam kii sthiti sudharne kii ummid he
 The deal is in the final stages for light combat aircraft MK a (83) and light combat helicopters (15)
 sardiyon main janme bacchon ko shuruaati daur main zyada care kii jarurat hoti he
 So, if you have become a new mother, then it is important for you to know what to do and what not to do to protect your child from cold
 aamtaur par log bacchon ko thand se bachaane ke liye khub saare kapade lad dete hai, jissenvjaat bacchapure vakt uncomfortable mahasoos karata he
 In such a situation, the doctor says that there is frost, but do not cover the baby so much that his skin cannot breathe
 kuch log sardi se bachaane ke liye dinabhar ghar main blor yaa heater chalaakar rakhte hai
 Such measures can also prove to be dangerous for the health of the newborn
 navjaat kii maalish ke liye apanaaen ye telumallik radics ke child specialist dow
 Amit Kumar said that all these methods are very wrong
 ye baat thik he ki bacchon ko thand se bachaana jaruri he, par bachaav kaa ye tarika unhen duusari pareshaaniyon main daal saktaa he
 Dr
 amit ke mutabik navjaat bacchon ko thand se bachaane ke liye in baton kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 
 
 While feeding newborn children, it should be kept in mind that water should not go over the neck
 bachche ko gardan ke neeche se hi nahalaayein
 Can wipe face, head and neck with wet cloth
 aisa isliye he kyonki naak, kaan or munh se pani andar ja saktaa he, jisase complications ho sakate hai
 Do not use a blower or heater to avoid cold
 isse nikalne vaali dry air bachche ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Instead you can use the ear heater
 thand sebacchon ko bachaane ke liebohut zyada kapade ladane kii bajaay, uskaa talavaa, uski hatheli or uske kaan va sir dhak kar rakhen
 These are the areas from which the heat loss is highest and from here the fear of frost is highest
 isliye bacchon ke topi, dastaane or mojey jarur pahanaakar rakhen
 Pillowing the child while sleeping can be dangerous
 
 
 sardiyon main dhoop bahut jaruri he isliye rojaanaa subah bachche ko san bath jarur karaaen
 This will help in the development of their bones
 ek se deb maheene tak bachche ko kisi outsidar yani ki ghar main baahar se aane vaale logon ke sampark main na jane den
 Especially if the person is infected, do not give the child in his lap
 bacchon kaa immune itnaa strong nahin hota
 They are still in the making, so they need to be kept away from infection
 smart bachche kii chahat he to pregnancy main khaanaa na bhoolen ye chigenek se deb maheene tak bachche ko kahin baahar na le jaaen
 Outside means somewhere, do not take it to an out station or a public place or a crowded place
 isse bhi bachche ko infections kaa dar hota he
 Mother's milk is most important for the development of the child
 chah maheene tak maa kaa doodh pine vaale bachche kaa immune system aise bacchon se zyada majboot hota he, jo baahar kaa doodh pite hai

 In both the statements, the cocktail of Vote, Daughter and Beauty has created a ruckus
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir vot ke liye beti or beauty kii charchaa kyon jaruri he?
 On Priyanka Sundar, there is a rush due to the departure of Smriti, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar, who was in discussion for his statements, crossed the border on Wednesday attacking Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi
 vinay katiyaar ne bolaa ki priyanka gandhi sundar mahila hai
 It is good that they campaign, they have not come out for a long time, but there are more beautiful women in the BJP, whom we will put
 ' unhone kaha, 'jitna priyanka ko khubasurat bataaya jaataa he, wo utani khubasurat nahin hai
 We have Smriti Irani here who gets crowded wherever she goes
 vah unase kahin zyada acha bhaashan detii hai
 'sharad Yadav said,' Vote more than daughter 'just on Tuesday, JDU leader Sharad Yadav gave a statement of vote more than daughter, which he got stuck on and the Women's Commission served a notice to him
 sharad yadav ne ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki vot kii keemat beti kii izzat se badhkar he
 Sharad Yadav was expressing concern over the declining level of electoral politics and money-vote alliance
 isi dauraan unhone yah vivaadit bayaan diya
 Sharad said that due to the money, the vote is bought and sold today
 haalanki sharad yadav ne vivaad ko badhata dekh buudhvaar ko isapar safai bhi di, unhone apni safai main kaha ki maine koi galat bayaan nahin diya he, vot or beti ke prati pyaar or izzat ek sa ho naa chahie

 Union Minister and National President of Lok Janshakti Party Ram Vilas Paswan has indicated that his son Chirag Paswan may join the Union Cabinet if the government is formed
 ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki unki party kii parliamentry board tay karegaa ki party se koun mantrimandal main shaamil hoga
 Ram Vilas Paswan is currently a minister in the current Modi government but he has not contested the Lok Sabha elections this time
 seat bantwaare ke mutabik, paswan kii party ko loksabhaa kii 6 seat milane ke saath-saath ek seat rajyasabha ko bhi di gai he

 It is being said that he can get a Rajya Sabha ticket from Assam
 halaki abhi nattejey nahin aae hai lekin mantrimandal main shaamil hone ke charche abhi se shuru ho gaye hai
 When Ram Vilas Paswan was asked whether this time his son Chirag Paswan would join the cabinet or he would become a minister himself, Ram Vilas Paswan said that the decision would be taken by the party's parliamentary board, headed by Chirag Paswan himself
 mana ja rahaa he ki ramvilas paswan apane bete ke bhavishya ke liye mantri pad bhi chhod sakate hai
 Since only one ministerial post can be given by Lok Janshakti Party quota, Chirag Paswan can get this opportunity
 halaki iske liye unhen 23 may kaa intjaar karnaa padegaa kyonki usee din unke nirvachan kshetra ke nattejey bhi aaenge
 Chirag Paswan, who is contesting from Jamui, has been challenged by rlsp's Bhudev Chaudhary
 mana ja rahaa he ki vahaan kaante kii takkar he lekin ramvilas paswan apane bete kii jeet ko lekar aashwast hai
 Happy with the exit poll, Ram Vilas Paswan says that he had already said that Modi has a tsunami and the NDA is expected to get 350 seats
 paswan ne jeet kaa sara shrey narendra modi ko diya
 He even said that we will win 40 of the 40 seats in Bihar
 ramvilas paswan ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki itani garmi main chunaav nahin hona chahie
 All the parties should decide on this and not just consider it

 On Thursday, BJP Delhi unit spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga retweeted a tweet from cnnnews18 in which in a photo, Rahul Gandhi is raising his hand to shake hands towards a man but the man standing in front is saying hello to Rahul
 cnnnews18 ne is photo ko lekar daawa kiya he ki is aadmi ne rahul gandhi se haath milaane ko manaa kar diya or rahul se kaha tha ki tumhaare pita ''fadar of mob linching" the
 It will be necessary to state here that Bagga tweeted a controversial claim on Kirajiv Gandhi Jayanti (20 August) claiming a survey
 isamen sawaal kiya gaya tha ki kisne zyada nirdosh bharatiyon kii hatya kii?saath hi 30,432 vot aane kaa daawa kiya gaya, bagga ke twit ke mutabik survey main 89%ne rajeev gandhi ko sabase zyada nirdosh bharatiyon kii hatya kaa kasuurvaar mana

 When India Today's Fact Check team found this photo on the internet, it was found that the first head of Congress IT cell Divya Spandana tweeted it

 It is clearly seen in these pictures that the person who is doing hello to Rahul with folded hands is also shaking hands with him
 And then this happened- a fellow Indian offered us some fresh juice on the house 😀pic
 twitter
 com / 2zf4bf5rpa— Divya Spandana / Ramya (@divyaspandana)august 22, 2018itnaa to saaf ho gaya ki cnnnews18 ke twit kiye gaye photo ke saath jo baat kahi gai thi, jise bagga ne bhi ritvit kiya, wo galat thi
 But the surprising issue was on what basis cnnnews18 made this claim in its tweet
 yah kahani bhi cnnnews18 ke is twitor handle par jane se khudbakhud saaf ho gai
 This handle is a parody of News18 TV channel
 yah baat is parody acount kii profile par bhi likhi hui he ki yah ek parody acount he or iskaa CNN yaa news18 se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Parody accounts are accounts created for fun or satire
 yah acount kisi news channel,artist,netaa aadi ke soshal media acount jaise dikhte he lekin hote nakli he
 These accounts are made so intelligently that if one does not pay attention, then one can easily get into the trap
 parody acount hansi majaak yaa vyang kii khabaren likhte he jise jane anjaane main log share kar dete he
 For example, if you look at the above parody Twitter account, then it has been tried to show it like the Twitter account of News18 TV channel
 jo profile pikchar News18 tivi channel ne apane twitor acount par istamaal kii he, waisi hi photo parody acount ne apni profile pikchar par laga rakhi he
 If you look at the Twitter handle and user name of the parody account, it has also been tried to make it like a real account
 News18 tivi channel kaa twitor handle "cnnnews18" he , vahiin parody acount kaa twitor handle cnnews69 he
 You can see that "blue Tick" is on News18's Twitter which means it is a verified account
 is tarah ke parody acount samay samay par apana yujar nem bhi badalte rahete he
 When Jabtajinder Pal Singh Baggane retweeted this tweet, the user name of this parody account was cnnnews18, but its user name became cnnnews69 shortly after
 ab ye to saaf nahin ki tajinder paal singh bagga bhi news channel ke chakkar main is parody acount se dhokhaa kha baithe yaa unhone parody acount kaa pataa hote hue bhi use ritvit kiya? lekin aisa aksar dekha jaataa he ki log in parody acount ke changul main fas jate he

 ) navaratri kaa parv najadik he, is saal 21 sitambar se sharad navaratri kii shuruuaat hogi
 In this festival lasting nine days, various forms of Goddess Durga are worshiped, this festival represents the victory of good over evil
 is dauraan log vrath main satvik bhojan ke saath-saath saaf safai aadi kai chizon kaa paalan karte hai
 At the same time there is a change of seasons
 navaratri ke dauraan anaaj (genhu or chaaval), namak, maansahaari bhojan, sharaab, pyaaj, lahasun ke alaava kai anya chizon ke seven ko varjit mana jaataa he
 But the question here is a morning cup of coffee and tea? Is it allowed in Navratri? is sawaal kaa jawaab itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Many believe that only tea can be consumed during the fast, but coffee drinkers are against this argument
 vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo yah maanate hai ki upwas ke dauraan chaay or coffee donon kaa seven kiya ja saktaa he
 Famous food writer Anuthi Vishal says nothing has been written anywhere about the rules of fasting for Navratri
 har insaan kii apni ek vyaktigat pasand hoti he
 Many years ago, people made such rules
 navaratri vah samay he jisamen maansahaari bhojan or anaaj kaa seven na karke vyakti apane sharir ko shuddh karata he
 So beverages like tea and coffee can be consumed during this time
 dilli kii rahane vaali shalini nandwani kaa kahana he ki vah pichley 20 saalon se navaratri ke vrath rakh rahi he or unke ghar main navaratri upwas ke dauraan chaay or coffee donon pine kii anumati he
 Buttermilk and fruit juice are also consumed along with it, but packed juices and other gas-mixed beverages are not consumed
 kya navaratri main coffee ke seven kii anumati he? Madhu Bhasin, who is a housewife, says that she has been observing Navratri fast for years and she consumes tea and coffee during this time
 hamaari koshish yahi hoti he ki packed or processd peya padaarth kaa seven na kiya jaae kyonki unamem kai kritrim agent hote hai
 Housewife Sarabjit Singh says that coffee may have a high caffeine content, but it is not known why coffee is skipped during Navratri
 kaaphi samay pehle coffee bharat main bahut zyada lokapriy nahin thi or yah abhi bhi chaay ke mukaable nahin he
 i doubt that there is any rule regarding this in Navratri
 har vyakti kii apni pasand he
 The important here is to avoid consuming things like meat, egg, wine, onion, garlic etc
 during Navratri
 tippaniyan Traditionally, Navaratri fasting is followed keeping in mind the changing seasons
 sharir ko kai sankraman se bachaane ke liye, kuch chuninda khaadya padaartho ko apni diet main shaamil karen
 Avoid consuming spicy beverages, instead of plain buttermilk etc
 navaratri ke upwas ke dauraan aaj zyaadaatar log chaay, coffee, falon ke zeus or milkshek kaa seven karte hai
 Navratri 2017: What is Sharad Navratri, take special care of these few things during fasting is sawaal kaa jawaab itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Many believe that only tea can be consumed during the fast, but coffee drinkers are against this argument
 vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo yah maanate hai ki upwas ke dauraan chaay or coffee donon kaa seven kiya ja saktaa he
 Famous food writer Anuthi Vishal says nothing has been written anywhere about the rules of fasting for Navratri
 har insaan kii apni ek vyaktigat pasand hoti he
 Many years ago, people made such rules
 navaratri vah samay he jisamen maansahaari bhojan or anaaj kaa seven na karke vyakti apane sharir ko shuddh karata he
 So beverages like tea and coffee can be consumed during this time
 dilli kii rahane vaali shalini nandwani kaa kahana he ki vah pichley 20 saalon se navaratri ke vrath rakh rahi he or unke ghar main navaratri upwas ke dauraan chaay or coffee donon pine kii anumati he
 Buttermilk and fruit juice are also consumed along with it, but packed juices and other gas-mixed beverages are not consumed
 kya navaratri main coffee ke seven kii anumati he? Madhu Bhasin, who is a housewife, says that she has been observing Navratri fast for years and she consumes tea and coffee during this time
 hamaari koshish yahi hoti he ki packed or processd peya padaarth kaa seven na kiya jaae kyonki unamem kai kritrim agent hote hai
 Housewife Sarabjit Singh says that coffee may have a high caffeine content, but it is not known why coffee is skipped during Navratri
 kaaphi samay pehle coffee bharat main bahut zyada lokapriy nahin thi or yah abhi bhi chaay ke mukaable nahin he
 i doubt that there is any rule regarding this in Navratri
 har vyakti kii apni pasand he
 The important here is to avoid consuming things like meat, egg, wine, onion, garlic etc
 during Navratri
 tippaniyan Traditionally, Navaratri fasting is followed keeping in mind the changing seasons
 sharir ko kai sankraman se bachaane ke liye, kuch chuninda khaadya padaartho ko apni diet main shaamil karen
 Avoid consuming spicy beverages, instead of plain buttermilk etc
 navaratri ke upwas ke dauraan aaj zyaadaatar log chaay, coffee, falon ke zeus or milkshek kaa seven karte hai

 We try not to consume packaged and processed beverages as they contain many artificial agents
 gruhinee sarbajit singh kaa kahana he ki shaayad coffee main caffeine kii maatra zyada hoti he, magar pataa nahin navaratri ke dauraan coffee ko kyon chhod diya jaataa he
 Coffee was not very popular in India a long time ago and it is still not comparable to tea
 mujhe is baat par andeh he ki navaratri main is baat ko lekar koi niyam he
 Everyone has their own choice
 yahaan mahatvapurn yah he ki navaratri ke dauraan meet, anda, sharaab, pyaaj, lahasun aadi jaisi chizon kaa seven karne se bachein
 The comments paramparaagat rup se, navaratri upwas main badalte mausam ko dhyaan main rakhkar paalan kiya jaataa he
 To protect the body from many infections, include a few select foods in your diet
 masaaledaar peya padaarthon kaa seven karne bachein inaki jagah plane chacha aadi kaa seven karen
 Most people today consume tea, coffee, fruit juices and milkshakes during the fast of Navratri

 raat ke 10
 It was 00 o'clock when the people of Malviya Nagar area along with the whole of Delhi were preparing to sleep
 tabhi yahaan lage ek sisitivi camere main kandhe par bag taange mobile par baat karti sadak se guzarati najar aati he
 She is moving very comfortably, oblivious of the time she has turned her hand on her hair
 lekin 10 seconds guzarate hi uske peeche tej kadamon se chalata ek doosraa shaks bhi najar aata he
 Wearing a white shirt and full pants, this man, while climbing the arms of his shirt, quickly looks at the girl, and it seems that her intentions are not right
 or phir iske baad thik vahi hota he, jiskaa dar he
 He goes straight from the back to grab the girl by the neck and tries to snatch her mobile phone from her
 achaanak hue is hamale se ladki ghabara jaati he, lekin wo apana phone nahin chhodti
 Rather, the noise begins to retreat
 lekin hamalavar use lagaataar daraata-dhamkata peeche kii ore dhakelta he or ek ke baad ek hamale karata hua sadak ke kinare khadi kaaron ke peeche le jaataa he
 And then upon reaching there, he breaks down on the girl, and starts beating her
 or is puure silsile ke dauraan ladki buree tarah cheekhti-chillaati rahati he
 Then some movement is seen on the other side of the road
 yaneehamalavarke ladki ko dabochne ke faqat 15 seconds ke andar kuch log ek diwaar phaand kar mauka-e-vaardaat kii taraf badhate najar aate hai
 Meanwhile, the person who attacked the girl suddenly realizes that he is surrounded
 or wo apane shikaar yani ladki ko chhod kar goli kii raftaar usee ore bhaagta he, jis ore se wo is sadak main aata hua pehali baar dikhaa tha
 Some boys moving towards the occasion after closing the wall are now seen running behind the attacker at full speed
 lekin chunki yahaan hamalavar kii jaan par ban ai he wo sir par pair rakh kar teji se bhaag jaataa he
 In fact, on the night of August 19, when Sonia, a girl from Uzbekistan, was returning to her friend's house in Delhi, a boy named Suraj tried to snatch her mobile phone from behind
 lekin isse pehle ki wo mobile jhapat kar aaraam se nikal paata, paas hi colony ke park main khel rahe is vaakye ke duusare kirdaaron yani inhen ladakon ne uskaa sara khel kharaab kar diya
 In fact, by creating a club called MNM i
e
 Malviya Nagar Maniac, the attention of these boys playing football in the park every night for the first time was when Sonia was trapped in the clutches of the sun and screaming badly
 
 pehle in ladakon ko ye laga ki shaayad koi road accident kaa shikaar ho kar dard se tadap rahi he
 But when he saw a boy in the back of the car hurling punches at a girl, he did not take time to understand the matter
 bas, phir kya tha? iske baad to gend lekar goalpost tak daud lagaanevaale in footballar ne jhapatmar kaa peechha kuch aisa kiya ki jald hi jhapatmar apane pairon par khadey hone laayak hi nahin bachaa
 According to the mnm's jawans, Suraj, who was accused of assault and looting, had managed to get lost in the dark by giving them a chance and was preparing to return empty-handed
 lekin tabhi kuch aisa hua ki puri baaji palat gai
 Upon reaching close to the school of Malviya Nagar, that snarling was lost in darkness
 ab sabhi ke sabhi ladakon ko lagane laga ki ab shaayad wo badmaash unke haath nahin aayega
 But then the eyes of a boy caught sight of a boy hiding in the dark behind cars parked near the school
 lekin najar padate hi wo shaks car ke peeche se naa sirf baahar nikal aayaa, balki bade aaraam se aage jane laga
 The boys were suspicious of him, when he asked the person hiding behind this car to hide there, he started to deny hiding
 usne kaha ki wo to bas udhar se guzar rahaa tha
 Apparently, he is of course lying with his mouth, his fast moving breaths and facial expressions opened his pole
 bas, iske baad to uske saath jo kuch hua
 It is also difficult to describe it correctly
 ab tak footbal ko apni kik se idhar-udhar oochhaalanevaale MNM yani malviya nagar maniek ke ladakon ne us par itane ghunse or kik barasaaye ki uski haalat chalane-phirane laayak bhi nahin bachi
 But it was yet to be confirmed that he had a break
 lihaaja, ladakon ne use haath-pairon se taang liya or nikal liye usee jaanib, jidhar se vaardaat kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Apparently no criminal ever calls himself a criminal
 or isi falsafe par chalate hue is jhapatmar ne bhi aisi kisi vaardaat ko anjaam dene se saaf inkaar kar diya
 That too when he was seen not by one, but by ten boys playing in the park
 ab aise main usase gunaah kubulawane ke liye mohalle ke ladakon ne bhi vahi kiya, jo aam taur par police muljimon ke saath karti he
 But since these boys were novices in the case of assault, they snatched the sun so that they could not even walk
 ab iske baad ladke use taang kar mauka e vaardaat par le aakar aae
 Whereupon the police along with the officials of Resident Welfare Association also arrived
 yaheen ladakon ne peedit ladki yani sonia se uske hamalavar kii pahchaan bhi karwaai or tab iske baad jhapatmar ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 But while this incident made the Jambajas of Malmaviya Nagarmaniyek famous throughout the night, Delhi, which was besieged by the claims of self-government, tried to make Delhi again a heartland of hearts
 america ne bharat ke khilaaf pakistan dwaara di gai parmaanu hamale kii dhamkiyon par kadi aapatti jataai he or is sambandh main pakistan ko apni nakhushi ke bare main suchit kiya he

 yah gambhir baat he

 ' unhone kaha tha, 'hamane parmaanu hathiyaar dikhaane ke liye nahin rakhe hai
 If such a situation arises, we will use it (nuclear weapons) and destroy India
 ' The statement has raised eyebrows of the Obama administration and is considered to be the 'irresponsible' behavior of the top Pakistani leadership

 ' adhikari ne apana naam nahin chhapane kii shart par yah jaankaree di, haalanki unhone is baat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ki pakistan ko yah sandesh kis str par bheja gaya he
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif has said twice in the last 15 days that his country can use nuclear weapons against India
 adhikari se jab asif ke is bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'yah bahut chintajanak he

 sabase oonchi prem sagaai
 Duryodhana's Nava Tyagi
 Increased Brindaban Gopin Nach nachhaisur Brutal Do Not Say It Worth It! Blessing: Surdas Ji says that the relationship of mutual love is a great relationship in the eyes of God
 
 abhimaan ke saath aadar dene vaale duryodhana kii parosi hui mewa ko tyagkar bhagwaan krishna ne vidura dwaara prem or aadar ke saath hari pattiyon se banaaya saag grahan kiya
 Under the influence of love, Rama had eaten the plum plum of a Bhil woman named Shabari
 prem ke vasheebhoot hi bhagwaan krishna apane bhakt narsingh mehta ke nai arthath sandeshvahak banakar gaye the
 Under love, he himself raised the juthi plates in the Rajsuya Yajna performed by Yudhishthira
 prem ke kaaran hi mahabharat-yuddh ke dauraan unhone arjuna ke rath kaa sarathi bananaa sweekaar kiya tha
 The Gods were so enthralled by the love and love of the gopis that they used to dance according to what they said, that is, they did as they said
 surdaas kehete hai ki meraa man to kathor he, usamen prem nahin he isliye main bhagwaan kii prashansa bhi bahut adhik nahin kar paata hoon
 There is a lot of disagreement among the writers about the birth date and birthplace of Surdas, the great poet of Bhakti Dhara
 phir bhi granthon se praapt saakshyon ke aadhaar par mana jaataa he ki mahakavi surdaas kaa janm saal 1535 main baishakh shukla panchami ko runakta naamak gaanv main hua tha
 The village is situated along the mathura-agra route
 unke pita kaa naam ramdaas tha
 He was also a lyricist
 kaha jaataa he ki surdaas janmaandh the, par iskaa bhi koi pramanik sakshya nahin miltaa
 Surdas, who was absorbed in Bhagavad Bhakti, had completely devoted himself to Krishna devotion
 manyata he ki krishnabhakti ke chalate unhone mahaj 6 saal kii umr main apane pita kii ajna lekar ghar chhod diya tha
 From then on, he started living on the Goughat of the Yamuna coast
 kehete hai jab vah bhagwaan krishna kii lila bhoomi vrindavan dham kii yatra par nikle to unki mulaakaat ballabhacharya se hui
 Mahakavi Surdas received devotion to devotion from Ballabhacharya
 surdaas or unke guru vallabhacharya ke bare main rochak tathy yah bhi he ki guru - shishy kii aayu main mahaj 10 din kaa antar tha
 Some scholars consider the birth of Guru Ballabhacharya as Vaishakha Krishna Ekadashi in 1534, hence many also consider the birth of Surdas as Vaishak Shukla Panchami of 1534
 kehete hai, guru ballabhacharya, apane shishy surdaas ko apane saath govardhan parvat mandir par le jate the, jahaan ve shrinath ji kii seva karte the, or har din nae pad banaakar iktaare ke madhyam se uskaa gayan karte the
 Ballabhacharya advised Surdas to sing 'bhagwat Leela'
 isse pehle vah keval dainya bhav se vinay ke pad rachaa karte the
 There are many stories about Surdas' devotion to Krishna
 ek katha ke mutabik, ek baar surdaas krishna kii bhakthi main itane dub gaye the ki ve ek kune ja gire, jiske baad bhagwaan krishna ne khud unki jaan bachaai or unke antahkaran main darshan bhi die
 It goes so far as to say that when Krishna saved Surdas' life, his eye light was returned
 is tarah surdaas ne is sansar main sabase pehle apane aradhy, priy krishna ko hi dekha tha
 It is said that when Krishna was pleased with Surdas' devotion and asked him to ask for a boon, Surdas said that i have got everything, you blind me again
 vah krishna ke alaava anya kisi ko dekhnaa nahin chaahate the
 The devotional songs of Mahakavi Surdas fascinate everyone
 unki pad-rachana or gaan-vidya kii khyaati dur-dur tak faili hui thi
 It is mentioned in literary circles that Tansen, one of the nine jewels of Akbar, had also met Emperor Akbar and Mahakavi Surdas in Mathura
 surdaas kii rachanaaon main krishna ke prati atoot prem or bhakthi kaa varnan miltaa he
 These creations include Vatsalya Ras, Shanta Ras, and Shringar Ras
 surdaas ne apni kalpana ke madhyam se krishna ke adbhut balya swaroop, unke sundar rup, unki divyata varnan kiya he
 Apart from this, Surdas has also described his pastimes
 surdaas kii rachanaaon main itani sajivta he, jaise lagata he unhone samoochee krishna lila apni ankhon se dekhi ho
 The 5 texts written by Mahakavi Surdas include Sur Sagar, Sur Saravali and Sahitya Lahiri, nal-damayanti and Bihalo
 sursagar unka sabase mashhoor granth he
 In this book, Surdas has described the pastimes of Shri Krishna very well
 is granth main sava lakh padon kaa sangrah hone kii baat kahi jaati hai, lekin ab keval saat se aath hajaar pad hi bache hai
 Only 100 copies of Sursagar were found between 1656 and 19th century
 sursagar ke 12 adhyyon main se 11 sankshipt rup main or 10waan skandh kaaphi vistaar se miltaa he
 Suresaravali is also a major text of Surdas
 isamen kul 1107 chand hai
 It is said that Surdas ji composed this book at the age of 67 years
 yah puraa granth ek 'vrihad holi' geet ke rup main rachaa gaya tha
 His supernatural love towards Krishna is also seen in this book
 sahityalahari bhi surdaas kaa anya prasiddh kavy granth he
 Sahitya Lahiri is a shorthand of 118 posts
 is granth kii khaas baat yah he ki iske aakhri pad main surdaas ne apane vanshavriksh ke bare main bataaya he, jiske anusaar surdaas kaa naam 'surajdas' he or vah chandbardaai ke vanshaj hai
 This book of Surdas ji comes under the category of Shringar Ras
 nal-damyanti surdaas kii krishna bhakthi se alag ek mahabharatakaleen nal or damyanti kii kahani he, to byaahlo surdaas bhi ek anya mashhoor granth hai
 Surdas is said to have lived beyond 100 years of age

 filmon main edlt content ko lekar sensor board or filmmekars kii bad rahi tanatani ab shaayad khatm ho jaaegi
 Because the Film Censor Board (CBFC) has made up its mind to implement the suggestion of increasing the category of films recommended by the Shyam Benegal Committee
 Hindustan times main chhapi khabar ke mutabik,sensor bordais baat par raji ho gai he ki filmon menedelt seens kii kaant jhaantki bajaae unhen kisi anya nai category main shaamil karnaa behatari hogi
 Talking about the current time, the news of nozzle has been in the news many times between filmmakers and censor board regarding 'A' and 'UA' certificates
 kyonki kising seen, sexual contate se lekar gaali gloch vaale contate ko sensor board kii taraf se ‘A’ category main shaamil kiya gaya he
 But these days usually all films contain this kind of content
 isliye is tarah kii filmon ke liye diarector, produsar ‘UA’ certificate ke liye sensor board se bhidate najar aate hai
 Therefore, Sensor Borden has decided to include several more categories with bold and nude content films
 sensor board jald in nai catagori ke suzav ko soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke paas bhejegi
 This is possible only when the Ministry agrees to change the existing Cinematography Act
 sensor board ke is prastaav ke tahat filmon ke liye ye nai shreniyan banaai gai hai:u or UA catagories ko badalakar ab UA12+ or UA15+ kar diya gaya haedlt yani a category kii filmon ko ab a or AC main baanta gaya he
 AC will be the category in which adult films will be shown with warning content
 AC category main pornography nahin dikhaa ja sakegifilmon ko ab online bhi certificate jari kiye jaaenge Although the World Cup of Cricket, the World Cup started 36 years ago, but its foundation was laid in 100 years ago in 1912
 yah un dinon kii baat he jabaki pehle do vishwa cap kaa champion westeindies or uske baad khitaab jeetne vaala bharat antarrashtriya cricket nahin khelaa karata tha
 At that time there was no limited overs cricket and only three teams Australia, England and South Africa played Test matches
 isliye in teenon team ke bich 27 may se 22 agast 1912 ke bich test cricket kaa trikoniya toornament khelaa gaya tha
 Such a tournament was proposed by the Imperial Cricket Council (which later became the International Cricket Council) in its first meeting in July 1909
 kharaab mausam or pratispadrdhi cricket ke abhaav main haalanki yah toornament safal nahin ho paaya or phir aisi pratiyogitaayen yojit nahin kii gayi lekin vishwa cap sahit is tarah ke toornament ke liye aage maardarshak ban gaya
 After this, when limited-overs cricket started in 1960, the hope of organizing tournaments was tied among many teams
 england main county tiimon ke bich nakout toornament ne is ummid par pankh lagaaye to mahila cricketer purushon ke liye prerana bani jinhone 1973 main pehla vishwa cap khelkar purush vishwa cap ke liye rasta taiyaar kiya tha
 The Women's World Cup was the brainchild of businessman Jack Hayward
 unhone is toornament par tab 40,000 pound kharchaa kiya tha
 Seven teams participated in this World Cup played in England
 mejabaan england ne 28 july ko edbeston main khele gayi final main austrailia ko haraakar khitaab jeeta tha
 The idea of organizing a knockout tournament between county teams in England was mooted by Mike Turner, the secretary of Leicestershire
 england main iske baad midlands cap kaa aayojan kiya gaya jabaki 1963 se shuru hone vaala gilette cap kaaphi mashhoor rahaa
 The first ODI was played between Australia and England on 5 January 1971 in Melbourne, followed by the opening World Cup in England four years later
 england main hi tab is tarah ke bade toornament yojit karne ke liye aadharbhoot dhaancha tha isliye usne na sirf 1975 balki iske baad 1979 or 1983 ke vishwa cap kii mejabani bhi kii
 The West Indies managed to win both the first World Cups in 1975 and 1979, while in 1983, India surprised the entire cricket world by becoming champions
 vishwa cap pehali baar england se baahar 1987 main bharat or pakistan main sanyukt rup se yojit kiya gaya jisamen austrailia apana pehla khitaab jeetne main safal rahaa
 Australia got their first hosting in 1992 where Pakistan was the champion
 bharat, pakistan or srilanka ne 1996 main jab mejabani kii to srilankai team ne khitaab jeeta
 This was followed by England champions in 1999, South Africa in 2003 and Australia in the World Cup in 2007 in the West Indies
 ab bharat, srilanka or bangladesh main sanyukt rup se vishwa cap yojit kiya ja rahaa he jabaki 2015 main isaki mejabani austrailia or newjiland karenge

 In Delhi, a man killed his wife's first husband

 The man named Mukesh, who lives in the outer district, suddenly disappeared
 parijanon ne police ko uske gum ho jane kii shikaayat kii
 Police and family members were looking for him
 tabhi police ko khabar mili ki dwarka ilaake main ek vyakti kaa kataa hua sir mila he
 Apparently the case was murder
 police maukey par pahunchi or sir ko baraamad kar liya
 But the problem for the police was that nothing of the torso was known
 sir se mritak kii shinaakht kii gai to uski pahchaan mukesh ke rup main ho gai
 Meanwhile, the Delhi Police got the news that a man's torso was recovered by the police in the Gurgaon city of Haryana, bordering the border
 jiskaa sir gaayab he
 It did not take long for the police to understand that after killing Mukesh his head was thrown in Delhi and the torso was placed in Gurgaon
 kisi tej dhar hathiyaar se uskaa galaa katkar katl kiya gaya tha
 The police began investigating the case
 sabase pehle police ne mukesh ke phone kii sidiaar nikalwai
 Just after that, the matter started to open from the call details and on the basis of that, the police arrested a 25-year-old youth named Rohit
 jab police ne rohit se sakhti ke saath poochtacha kii to isaktlaki vaardaat se pardaa uth gaya
 Rohit told the police that the deceased Mukesh was his wife's first husband
 use shaq tha ki aaj bhi uski patni ke mukesh ke saath sambandh hai
 It was with this suspicion that he conspired to remove Mukesh from the road
 usne apni yojana ke tahat mukesh ko party ke bahaane mongolpuri ilaake main bulaayaa or phir apane teen saathiyon ke saath milakar tejadhaar aari se uskaa galaa kaat diya
 For the purpose of erasing evidence of murder, Rohit severed Mukesh's head from his torso
 iske baad usne laash kaa sir dilli ke dwarka ilaake main or dhad gudgaanv main phenk diya
 But Mukesh's call details opened up the whole issue

 An assistant to Gilani told India Today on January 11 that both the Prime Minister and the President were surprised by the military's statement

 2019 se pehle 1992 aa rahaa he balki aa chukaa he
 The wait is now about when Prime Minister Narendra Modi enters this political game of 1992
 2014 main pradhanmantri kii ummidavaar ke taur par narend modi ke bhaashanon ko yaad kiijie, kya aapako koi bhaashan yaad aata he jo mukhya rup se ram mandir par kendrit ho
 Mother Ganga had definitely come in that election, but the question of Ram temple was lodged in the Manifisto on some shore
 2014 ke menifeston main ram mandir kaa zikr pej number 37 par tha
 Those three lines on the 37th page among the 38-page manifestos
 magar kuch dinon se ram mandir bijepi or sangh ke netaaon ke bhaashan main pehle panne par aa gaya he
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi deliver a speech at the Ram temple
 2014 ke baad ke vidhansabha chunaavon main pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki rajya or dilli main ek sarkaar hogi to team kii tarah kaam karegi
 Then when Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath made Faizabad district to Ayodhya then why did not the Prime Minister's tweet come
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 While the Prime Minister was active on his Twitter handle until after Yogi's announcement, he was replying to people's tweets
 kya aaj ke din mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke is bade faisle par badhai nahin deni chahie thi? yaa donon alag alag raaston par chalate hue kisi aghoshit manzil tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been clear about Ayodhya from the beginning
 pichhali diwali ke pehle bhi vahiin the
 He is also there before this Diwali
 bijepi ne virdohi dalon se to poocha he magar pradhanmantri ne abhi tak apni raay nahin bataai he
 Wait when they leave Vikas or come open in the case of Ram temple along with development
 idhar dilli kisi or chiz main vyast he
 CBI quarrel is on the road, in court
 arabiai kaa jhagada rose sadak par aa rahaa he
 Today the root cause of that quarrel came to light
 indian express kii pehali khabar hi yahi he ki reserve bank ne sarkaar ko 3 lakh 60,000 karod dene se manaa kar diya he
 Last Wednesday itself, the government said that it respects the autonomy of the RBI but both have to work in the public interest according to the needs of the Indian economy
 express ke sanni verma ke is report ne jhagade kii vajah bataa di he
 9 with the Reserve Bank of India
 59 lakh karod kaa reserve he
 3 of it
 6 lakh karod sarplus he
 The government wants this part for itself
 mantralay kaa suzav he ki is sarplus kaa kaise istamaal karnaa he, sarkaar or reserve bank donon milakar tay kar sakate hai
 The existing rules are based on very conservative thinking
 arabiai ke sutron ne reserve bank ko bataaya he ki sarkaar reserve bank ke reserve khazaane main haath lagaana chaahati he
 If this happens, the stability of the macroeconomy will be affected
 arabiai ne is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 It is not that the Reserve Bank does not provide the surpluses, except the year of demonetisation, it is usually near 50,000 crore
 lekin sarkaar kii nazar 3 lakh 60 hazaar karod par he
 So that this money can be handed over to the banks which do not have capital and they will start distributing loans again to all
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley hafte vivaad isi baat ko lekar shuru hua tha jab dipti governor viral acharya ne argentina kaa udhaaharan de diya tha ki vahaan kii sarkaar bhi reserve bank ke khazaane ko hathiyanna chaahati thi, virodh main governor ne istipha diya or vahaan tabaahi aa gai
 But this news of the Express confirms that the rare Acharya was making public the intention of the government on the pretext of Argentina
 janata ko bataa rahe the
 The newspaper wrote that the Reserve Bank made a condition of giving money from its reserve when no government representative was present on its board
 arabiai or sarkaar ke bich is kheenchaatani kaa nateeja kya hoga, kya reserve bank sarkaar ko apana rigerv saunp degaa, uskaa arthvyavastha par kya asar padegaa, kai jaankaar kehete hai ki acha asar nahin padegaa
 Our colleague Himanshu has spoken to Vipin Malik, who has been a member of the board of the Reserve Bank
 vipin malik kehete hai, 'sarkaar kaa ye kahana ki arabiai use apane rigerv main se 2 lakh yaa 3 lakh karod de de
 It cannot be done
 sarkaar ke bajtiy anumaanon main market borowing kaa program tha wo puraa nahin ho paa rahaa he
 11 public sector banks have moved to PCA
 baaki bainkon main nakadi kii killat he
 ' china ke saath yuddh ke samay ek baar reserve bank ke reserve se paisa liya gaya he
 The war was going on then, but there is no other example in this long history
 abhi kya aise halaat hai jab sarkaar kii nazar arabiai ke reserve sarplus par he
 Meanwhile, former Governor Raghuram Rajan has been interviewed
 rajan ne sienbisi channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ji se baat kii he
 Rajan has also endorsed Deputy Governor Viral Acharya in a way that the government should not try to lay hands on the Reserve Bank, it is not good for the economy
 ek baar aapane kisi ko governor or dipti governor niyukt kar diya to aapako unki baat sunani chahie
 Government and RBI respect each other's thinking
 arabiai ko rahul david kii tarah khelnaa hoga, navjot singh siddhu kii tarah nahin
 The country will benefit from an independent and strong RBI
 sarkaar or arabiai ke bich chal rahaa yah takaraav ab or nahin badhanaa chahie
 It is necessary to save the Reserve Bank as a national institution
 agar sarkaar bahut zyaada dabaav detii he to reserve bank ko adhikaar he wo naa kah de
 The government should present its stand with the Reserve Bank but the RBI should decide
 reserve bank ke board kaa kaam duusare hiton kaa bachaav karnaa nahin he balki apane santhaan ke hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 ' ham aapako phir se bataa den ki raghuram rajan ne yah intervyuu sienbisi news channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ko diya he
 But why does the government want to take this money from the Reserve Bank
 china yuddh ke samay ek baar aisa hua tha magar vah yuddh kaa samay tha, uske baad kabhi kisi daur main sarkaar ne reserve bank ke reserve par haath nahin daalaa
 When the government is claiming that tax collection has increased due to GST and income tax then why the government needs this money
 19 november ko reserve bank ke gavarning body kii baithak he
 a lot has to be decided in that meeting
 gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaen sankat se guzar rahi hai
 You will know that ILFS is in crisis
 isaki kai companiyon ne jo lone liye hai wo chukaaye nahin gaye hai
 These institutions also give further loans by taking loans, so when they are unable to repay their loan then there will be a shortage of money in the market
 ek tarah se haahaakaar much saktaa he
 The market started falling when it was first reported that ILFS was also defaulting
 asocham ke secetry general udai verma bhi ek tarah se sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 Rajan has also made a statement, like Verma, that the Reserve Bank should inject money to overcome the NBFC crisis
 angreji ke akhabaaron main khub lekh chap rahe hai ki rigerv bank swytt to he magar uskaa bos sarkaar he isliye janhit main sarkaar kii baat manani chahie
 Why the Reserve Bank of India is being pressurized for this money suddenly
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Before making final opinion read the article of Surjeet Bhalla, Prabhat Patnaik
 kai or logon ne bhi likhe hai
 Now talk about Ayodhya
 elahabaad kaa naam badalane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile kaa naam badal diya he
 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya
 loksabhaa kaa naam faizabad he
 Will the name of the Lok Sabha constituency be changed along with this or will the parliamentary constituency be called Faizabad
 bijepi ke hi lallu singh faizabad se saansad hai
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava from Faizabad told that Prime Minister Modi had gone to Faizabad in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, not to Ayodhya
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main faizabad bhi nahin gaye, ayodhya bhi nahin gaye
 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue
 jo bhi he itani badi ghoshnaa ho gai he or shaam chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje tak yani jab prime time shuru hua tab tak pradhanmantri or amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 Both did not congratulate Yogi Adityanath with this big announcement
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ayodhya par twit nahin kiya he, 6 bajkar 40 minute par unka twit aayaa he jisamen dakshin korea kii first ladi kii tasviir he
 He mentions ancient contacts between South Korea and Ayodhya, refers to Ayodhya's program, photo but no tweet has come on Yogi's declarations
 2019 ke naam par 1992 aa rahaa he, sabaki raay aa chuki he, pradhanmantri kii raay nahin ai he
 Will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya? Comments yogi adityanath pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki ayodhya main ram kii pratimaa kaayam karenge
 It will be different from the Ram temple
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha ki ayodhya main ek medical kalege banegaa jiskaa naam rajarshi dasharath par hoga or airport kaa naam purushottam ram ke naam par hoga
 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah
 faizabad kaa naam badla gaya he us par ve kya kehete hai
 So nothing was found on his Twitter handle
 unhone kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko janmdin par badhai di he magar yogi adityanath ke itane bade faisle par bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri modi ne koi twit tak nahin kiya
 Apart from politics, today you should notice the coverage of news channels separately
 screen kaa rang tak badal gaya tha
 Faizabad had a different color, Ayodhya had a different color
 screen par jin pratikon kaa istamaal ho rahaa tha, use samajhane or satark hone kii zarurat he
 For four years, the national syllabus of the Hindu Muslim topic which was running on the news channels, is now in full swing
 tivi channelon ke parde par jo pattiyaan likhi hui aa rahi hai, un par dharmikata kaa rang he
 Is unilaterally in a terrible way
 unka tone kuch or he
 There is a need to watch the channels with some caution before nothing remains to be seen
 baaki aap samajhadaar hai
 These are not all new changes, but after a long time the old phase is returning, so they need to be understood
 sirf tivi dekhne se aap darshak nahin ho jate hai, darshak bane rahane ke liye alag se padhanaa bhi chahie
 Without reading, you will neither understand your audience nor your television
 yah kitaab he arvind rajagopal kii kitaab politics after television pard sakate hai
 The book is very expensive
 phir bhi aap librari se lekar pard sakate hai
 Exists in PDF form on the Internet
 is kitaab kii vishay suchi se hi aap bahut kuch samaj sakate hai or aaj ke news channelon ko dekh sakate hai
 In the post-2014 assembly elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that if there is a government in the state and Delhi will work like a team
 phir jab mukhyamatri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile ko ayodhya kiya tab pradhanmantri kaa koi twit kyon nahin aayaa
 No tweet came from BJP President Amit Shah
 jabaki yogi ji kii ghoshnaa ke baad tak pradhananmatri apane twitor handle par sakriy the, logon ke twit kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Shouldn't this day be congratulating Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on this big decision? Or both want to reach an undisclosed destination walking on different paths
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ayodhya ko lekar shuru se spasht hai
 He was there even before last Diwali
 is diwali ke pehle bhi vahiin hai
 BJP has asked opposing parties but the Prime Minister has not yet stated his opinion
 intazaar kiijie ki ve kab vikaas chhodkar yaa vikaas ke saath saath ram mandir ke maamle main khulkar aate hai
 Here Delhi is busy with something else
 sibiai kaa jhagada sadak par he, court main he
 RBI quarrel is coming on the road every day
 aaj us jhagade kaa mul kaaran saamne aa gaya
 The first news of the Indian Express is that the Reserve Bank has refused to give 3 lakh 60,000 crore to the government
 pichley buudhvaar ko hi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vah arabiai kii swaittata kaa sammaan karti he lekin donon ko bhartiya arthvyavastha kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se janhit main kaam karnaa hoga
 This report by Sunny Verma of Express has given the reason for the quarrel
 bhartiya reserve bank ke paas 9
 There is a reserve of 59 lakh crores
 isamen se 3
 6 lakh crore is surplus
 sarkaar yahi hissaa apane liye chaahati he
 The Ministry suggests that both the government and the Reserve Bank can decide jointly how to use this surplus
 maujuuda jo niyam hai wo behad rudhiwaadi soch ke aadhaar par banaae gaye hai
 Sources in the RBI have told the Reserve Bank that the government wants to join the Reserve Bank's Reserve Treasury
 aisa hoga to vyapak arthvyavastha kii sthirataa par asar padegaa
 The RBI rejected the proposal
 aisa nahin he ki reserve bank saraples nahin detaa he, notebandi ke saal ko chhod den to aam taur par yah 50,000 karod ke paas hota hi he
 But the government is eyeing 3 lakh 60 thousand crores
 taaki is paise ko un bainkon ke hawaale kiya ja sake jinke paas puunji nahin he or ve aage phir se sabko lone baantne lagen
 You may remember that the controversy started last week when Deputy Governor Viral Acharya gave the example of Argentina that the government there also wanted to take over the treasury of the Reserve Bank, in protest the governor resigned and there was devastation
 Has gone
 lekin express kii is khabar se isaki pushti hoti he ki viral acharya argentina ke bahaane sarkaar ke iraade ko hi public kar rahe the
 Was telling the public
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki apane reserve se paisa dene kii shart reserve bank ne tab kar liya jab sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda uske board main maujuud nahin tha
 What will be the result of this tussle between the RBI and the government, whether the Reserve Bank will hand over its reserves to the government, what effect it will have on the economy, many experts say that will not have a good effect
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu ne vipin malik se baat kii he jo reserve bank ke board ke sadsy rahe hai
 Says Vipin Malik, 'the government says that the RBI should give it 2 lakh or 3 lakh crore out of its reserve
 ye nahin ho saktaa he
 In the budgetary estimates of the government, the market borrowing program was not being completed
 11 saarvajanik kshetra ke bank pisie main chale gaye hai

 ' Let us tell you again that Raghuram Rajan has given this interview to CNBC News Channel anchor Lata Venkatesh
 lekin sarkaar kyon reserve bank se yah paisa lenaa chaahati he
 It happened once during the China War but it was the time of the war, never did the government hand over the reserve of the Reserve Bank after that
 sarkaar jab daawa kar rahi ho ki jiesti or inakam tex se kar sangrah bad gaya he tab kyon sarkaar ko is paise kii zarurat he
 There is a meeting of the governing body of the Reserve Bank on 19 November

 ab baat ayodhya kii
 After renaming Allahabad, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has changed the name of Faizabad district
 pehle ayodhya faizabad zile main aata tha, ab ayodhya ke naam kaa jila ho gaya
 Ayodhya, the city of Ram, has got the title of district, this has been shown by the media as big news
 ayodhya ke naam se vidhansabha seat pehle se he
 The name of the Lok Sabha is Faizabad
 kya isi ke saath loksabhaa kshetra kaa naam bhi badal jayega yaa sansadeey kshetra faizabad hi kehalaayegaa
 Lallu Singh of BJP is an MP from Faizabad
 faizabad se hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main faizabad gaye the, ayodhya nahin gaye the
 Faizabad did not even go to Ayodhya in the 2017 assembly elections
 ayodhya vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke hi vidhayak hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya 7 times and Faizabad 3 times
 sawaal he pradhanmantri modi ayodhya kab jaaenge, babari masjid dhwans or ram mandir ke masale par kab bolenge
 Whatever it is, such a big announcement has been made and no tweet came from the Prime Minister and Amit Shah from 6 pm to 9 pm, when the prime time started
 is bade elaan ke saath donon ne yogi adityanath ko badhai nahin di
 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has not tweeted on Ayodhya, his tweet has come at 6
40 AM which has a picture of South Korea's First Lady
 unhone dakshin korea or ayodhya ke pracheen sampark kaa zikr he, ayodhya ke kaarykram kaa zikr he, tasviir he magar yogi kii ghoshnaaon par koi twit nahin aayaa he
 1992 is coming in the name of 2019, everyone's opinion has been arrived, Prime Minister's opinion has not come
 kya pradhanmantri modi ayodhya jaaenge?tippaniyan Yogi Adityanath has already announced that he will establish the statue of Rama in Ayodhya
 yah ram mandir se alag hoga
 Chief Minister Adityanath said that a medical college will be built in Ayodhya named after Rajarshi Dasharatha and the airport will be named after Purushottam Ram
 hamane bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa twitor handle bhi check kiya
 Faizabad's name has been changed to what they say
 to unke twitor handle par is bare main kuch nahin mila
 He congratulated Union Minister Jitendra Singh on his birthday, but BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi did not even tweet at such a big decision of Yogi Adityanath
 raajnneeti ke alaava aaj ke din aapako news channelon ke kawarej ko alag se notice karnaa chahie
 The screen color was also changed
 faizabad kaa rang alag tha, ayodhya ke liye rang alag tha
 The symbols used on the screen need to be understood and cautious
 chaar saal se news channelon par jo hindu muslim topic kaa neshnal silebus chal rahaa tha, wo ab apane puure shabaab par he
 The strips which are written on the screen of TV channels have a color of righteousness on them
 bhayanak tareeke se ekatarfa he
 His tone is something else
 thodaa satark hokar channelon ko dekhne kii zarurat he isse pehle ki kuch bhi dekhne laayak hi na bache

 indian express kii pehali khabar hi yahi he ki reserve bank ne sarkaar ko 3 lakh 60,000 karod dene se manaa kar diya he
 Last Wednesday itself, the government said that it respects the autonomy of the RBI but both have to work in the public interest according to the needs of the Indian economy
 express ke sanni verma ke is report ne jhagade kii vajah bataa di he
 9 with the Reserve Bank of India
 59 lakh karod kaa reserve he
 3 of it
 6 lakh karod sarplus he
 The government wants this part for itself
 mantralay kaa suzav he ki is sarplus kaa kaise istamaal karnaa he, sarkaar or reserve bank donon milakar tay kar sakate hai
 The existing rules are based on very conservative thinking
 arabiai ke sutron ne reserve bank ko bataaya he ki sarkaar reserve bank ke reserve khazaane main haath lagaana chaahati he
 If this happens, the stability of the macroeconomy will be affected
 arabiai ne is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 It is not that the Reserve Bank does not provide the surpluses, except the year of demonetisation, it is usually near 50,000 crore
 lekin sarkaar kii nazar 3 lakh 60 hazaar karod par he
 So that this money can be handed over to the banks which do not have capital and they will start distributing loans again to all
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley hafte vivaad isi baat ko lekar shuru hua tha jab dipti governor viral acharya ne argentina kaa udhaaharan de diya tha ki vahaan kii sarkaar bhi reserve bank ke khazaane ko hathiyanna chaahati thi, virodh main governor ne istipha diya or vahaan tabaahi aa gai
 But this news of the Express confirms that the rare Acharya was making public the intention of the government on the pretext of Argentina
 janata ko bataa rahe the
 The newspaper wrote that the Reserve Bank made a condition of giving money from its reserve when no government representative was present on its board
 arabiai or sarkaar ke bich is kheenchaatani kaa nateeja kya hoga, kya reserve bank sarkaar ko apana rigerv saunp degaa, uskaa arthvyavastha par kya asar padegaa, kai jaankaar kehete hai ki acha asar nahin padegaa
 Our colleague Himanshu has spoken to Vipin Malik, who has been a member of the board of the Reserve Bank
 vipin malik kehete hai, 'sarkaar kaa ye kahana ki arabiai use apane rigerv main se 2 lakh yaa 3 lakh karod de de
 It cannot be done
 sarkaar ke bajtiy anumaanon main market borowing kaa program tha wo puraa nahin ho paa rahaa he
 11 public sector banks have moved to PCA
 baaki bainkon main nakadi kii killat he
 ' china ke saath yuddh ke samay ek baar reserve bank ke reserve se paisa liya gaya he
 The war was going on then, but there is no other example in this long history
 abhi kya aise halaat hai jab sarkaar kii nazar arabiai ke reserve sarplus par he
 Meanwhile, former Governor Raghuram Rajan has been interviewed
 rajan ne sienbisi channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ji se baat kii he
 Rajan has also endorsed Deputy Governor Viral Acharya in a way that the government should not try to lay hands on the Reserve Bank, it is not good for the economy
 ek baar aapane kisi ko governor or dipti governor niyukt kar diya to aapako unki baat sunani chahie
 Government and RBI respect each other's thinking
 arabiai ko rahul david kii tarah khelnaa hoga, navjot singh siddhu kii tarah nahin
 The country will benefit from an independent and strong RBI
 sarkaar or arabiai ke bich chal rahaa yah takaraav ab or nahin badhanaa chahie
 It is necessary to save the Reserve Bank as a national institution
 agar sarkaar bahut zyaada dabaav detii he to reserve bank ko adhikaar he wo naa kah de
 The government should present its stand with the Reserve Bank but the RBI should decide
 reserve bank ke board kaa kaam duusare hiton kaa bachaav karnaa nahin he balki apane santhaan ke hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 ' ham aapako phir se bataa den ki raghuram rajan ne yah intervyuu sienbisi news channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ko diya he
 But why does the government want to take this money from the Reserve Bank
 china yuddh ke samay ek baar aisa hua tha magar vah yuddh kaa samay tha, uske baad kabhi kisi daur main sarkaar ne reserve bank ke reserve par haath nahin daalaa
 When the government is claiming that tax collection has increased due to GST and income tax then why the government needs this money
 19 november ko reserve bank ke gavarning body kii baithak he
 a lot has to be decided in that meeting
 gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaen sankat se guzar rahi hai
 You will know that ILFS is in crisis
 isaki kai companiyon ne jo lone liye hai wo chukaaye nahin gaye hai
 These institutions also give further loans by taking loans, so when they are unable to repay their loan then there will be a shortage of money in the market
 ek tarah se haahaakaar much saktaa he
 The market started falling when it was first reported that ILFS was also defaulting
 asocham ke secetry general udai verma bhi ek tarah se sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 Rajan has also made a statement, like Verma, that the Reserve Bank should inject money to overcome the NBFC crisis
 angreji ke akhabaaron main khub lekh chap rahe hai ki rigerv bank swytt to he magar uskaa bos sarkaar he isliye janhit main sarkaar kii baat manani chahie
 Why the Reserve Bank of India is being pressurized for this money suddenly
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Before making final opinion read the article of Surjeet Bhalla, Prabhat Patnaik
 kai or logon ne bhi likhe hai
 Now talk about Ayodhya
 elahabaad kaa naam badalane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile kaa naam badal diya he
 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya
 loksabhaa kaa naam faizabad he
 Will the name of the Lok Sabha constituency be changed along with this or will the parliamentary constituency be called Faizabad
 bijepi ke hi lallu singh faizabad se saansad hai
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava from Faizabad told that Prime Minister Modi had gone to Faizabad in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, not to Ayodhya
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main faizabad bhi nahin gaye, ayodhya bhi nahin gaye
 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue
 jo bhi he itani badi ghoshnaa ho gai he or shaam chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje tak yani jab prime time shuru hua tab tak pradhanmantri or amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 Both did not congratulate Yogi Adityanath with this big announcement
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ayodhya par twit nahin kiya he, 6 bajkar 40 minute par unka twit aayaa he jisamen dakshin korea kii first ladi kii tasviir he
 He mentions ancient contacts between South Korea and Ayodhya, refers to Ayodhya's program, photo but no tweet has come on Yogi's declarations
 2019 ke naam par 1992 aa rahaa he, sabaki raay aa chuki he, pradhanmantri kii raay nahin ai he
 Will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya? Comments yogi adityanath pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki ayodhya main ram kii pratimaa kaayam karenge
 It will be different from the Ram temple
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha ki ayodhya main ek medical kalege banegaa jiskaa naam rajarshi dasharath par hoga or airport kaa naam purushottam ram ke naam par hoga
 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah
 faizabad kaa naam badla gaya he us par ve kya kehete hai
 So nothing was found on his Twitter handle
 unhone kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko janmdin par badhai di he magar yogi adityanath ke itane bade faisle par bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri modi ne koi twit tak nahin kiya
 Apart from politics, today you should notice the coverage of news channels separately
 screen kaa rang tak badal gaya tha
 Faizabad had a different color, Ayodhya had a different color
 screen par jin pratikon kaa istamaal ho rahaa tha, use samajhane or satark hone kii zarurat he
 For four years, the national syllabus of the Hindu Muslim topic which was running on the news channels, is now in full swing
 tivi channelon ke parde par jo pattiyaan likhi hui aa rahi hai, un par dharmikata kaa rang he
 Is unilaterally in a terrible way
 unka tone kuch or he
 There is a need to watch the channels with some caution before nothing remains to be seen
 baaki aap samajhadaar hai
 These are not all new changes, but after a long time the old phase is returning, so they need to be understood
 sirf tivi dekhne se aap darshak nahin ho jate hai, darshak bane rahane ke liye alag se padhanaa bhi chahie
 Without reading, you will neither understand your audience nor your television
 yah kitaab he arvind rajagopal kii kitaab politics after television pard sakate hai
 The book is very expensive
 phir bhi aap librari se lekar pard sakate hai
 Exists in PDF form on the Internet
 is kitaab kii vishay suchi se hi aap bahut kuch samaj sakate hai or aaj ke news channelon ko dekh sakate hai
 You may remember that the controversy started last week when Deputy Governor Viral Acharya gave the example of Argentina that the government there also wanted to take over the treasury of the Reserve Bank, in protest the governor resigned and there was devastation
 Has gone
 lekin express kii is khabar se isaki pushti hoti he ki viral acharya argentina ke bahaane sarkaar ke iraade ko hi public kar rahe the
 Was telling the public
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki apane reserve se paisa dene kii shart reserve bank ne tab kar liya jab sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda uske board main maujuud nahin tha
 What will be the result of this tussle between the RBI and the government, whether the Reserve Bank will hand over its reserves to the government, what effect it will have on the economy, many experts say that will not have a good effect
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu ne vipin malik se baat kii he jo reserve bank ke board ke sadsy rahe hai
 Says Vipin Malik, 'the government says that the RBI should give it 2 lakh or 3 lakh crore out of its reserve
 ye nahin ho saktaa he
 In the budgetary estimates of the government, the market borrowing program was not being completed
 11 saarvajanik kshetra ke bank pisie main chale gaye hai
 The rest of the banks have a cash crunch
 ' Money has been taken from the Reserve Bank's Reserve once during the war with China

 Let us tell you again that Raghuram Rajan has given this interview to CNBC News Channel anchor Lata Venkatesh
 lekin sarkaar kyon reserve bank se yah paisa lenaa chaahati he
 It happened once during the China War but it was the time of the war, never did the government hand over the reserve of the Reserve Bank after that
 sarkaar jab daawa kar rahi ho ki jiesti or inakam tex se kar sangrah bad gaya he tab kyon sarkaar ko is paise kii zarurat he
 There is a meeting of the governing body of the Reserve Bank on 19 November
 us baithak main kaaphi kuch tay hona he
 Non-banking financial institutions are going through a crisis
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki lephes sankat main he
 The loans taken by many of its companies have not been repaid
 yah sansthaaen bhi lone lekar aage lone detii hai lihaaza jab yah apana lone nahin chukaa paaengi to bazaar main paise kii kami ho jaaegi
 In a way, there can be chaos
 jab pehali baar yah khabar ai thi ki lephes bhi difolt karne lagi he tab bazaar girane laga tha
 Assocham secretary general Uday Verma is also seen standing with the government in a way
 rajan ne bhi verma kii tarah bayaan diya he ki reserve bank ko enbiensi ke sankat ko dur karne ke liye paisa daalana chahie
 There are a lot of articles published in English newspapers that the Reserve Bank is autonomous but its boss is the government, so the government should be obeyed in the public interest
 kyon achaanak is paise ke liye rigerv bank par janhit kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 This is also a question
 antim raay banane se pehle surajeet bhalla, prabhaat patnayak ke lekh ko padhie

 ab baat ayodhya kii
 After renaming Allahabad, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has changed the name of Faizabad district
 pehle ayodhya faizabad zile main aata tha, ab ayodhya ke naam kaa jila ho gaya
 Ayodhya, the city of Ram, has got the title of district, this has been shown by the media as big news
 ayodhya ke naam se vidhansabha seat pehle se he
 The name of the Lok Sabha is Faizabad
 kya isi ke saath loksabhaa kshetra kaa naam bhi badal jayega yaa sansadeey kshetra faizabad hi kehalaayegaa
 Lallu Singh of BJP is an MP from Faizabad
 faizabad se hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main faizabad gaye the, ayodhya nahin gaye the
 Faizabad did not even go to Ayodhya in the 2017 assembly elections
 ayodhya vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke hi vidhayak hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya 7 times and Faizabad 3 times
 sawaal he pradhanmantri modi ayodhya kab jaaenge, babari masjid dhwans or ram mandir ke masale par kab bolenge
 Whatever it is, such a big announcement has been made and no tweet came from the Prime Minister and Amit Shah from 6 pm to 9 pm, when the prime time started
 is bade elaan ke saath donon ne yogi adityanath ko badhai nahin di
 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has not tweeted on Ayodhya, his tweet has come at 6
40 AM which has a picture of South Korea's First Lady
 unhone dakshin korea or ayodhya ke pracheen sampark kaa zikr he, ayodhya ke kaarykram kaa zikr he, tasviir he magar yogi kii ghoshnaaon par koi twit nahin aayaa he
 1992 is coming in the name of 2019, everyone's opinion has been arrived, Prime Minister's opinion has not come
 kya pradhanmantri modi ayodhya jaaenge?tippaniyan Yogi Adityanath has already announced that he will establish the statue of Rama in Ayodhya
 yah ram mandir se alag hoga
 Chief Minister Adityanath said that a medical college will be built in Ayodhya named after Rajarshi Dasharatha and the airport will be named after Purushottam Ram
 hamane bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa twitor handle bhi check kiya
 Faizabad's name has been changed to what they say
 to unke twitor handle par is bare main kuch nahin mila
 He congratulated Union Minister Jitendra Singh on his birthday, but BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi did not even tweet at such a big decision of Yogi Adityanath
 raajnneeti ke alaava aaj ke din aapako news channelon ke kawarej ko alag se notice karnaa chahie
 The screen color was also changed
 faizabad kaa rang alag tha, ayodhya ke liye rang alag tha
 The symbols used on the screen need to be understood and cautious
 chaar saal se news channelon par jo hindu muslim topic kaa neshnal silebus chal rahaa tha, wo ab apane puure shabaab par he
 The strips which are written on the screen of TV channels have a color of righteousness on them
 bhayanak tareeke se ekatarfa he
 His tone is something else
 thodaa satark hokar channelon ko dekhne kii zarurat he isse pehle ki kuch bhi dekhne laayak hi na bache
 The rest of you are smart
 ye sab nae badlaav nahin hai magar bahut dinon baad purana daur laut rahaa he to inhen samajhane kii zarurat he
 You do not become an audience just by watching TV, you must also study separately to remain a viewer
 bina padhe aap na to apane darshak hone ko samaj paaenge or na hi tivi ko
 This book is Arvind Rajagopal's book politics after television
 kitaab bahut mahangi he
 You can still read from the library
 internet par peedief farm main maujuud he
 You can understand a lot from the content list of this book and can watch today's news channels
 19 november ko reserve bank ke gavarning body kii baithak he
 a lot has to be decided in that meeting
 gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaen sankat se guzar rahi hai
 You will know that ILFS is in crisis
 isaki kai companiyon ne jo lone liye hai wo chukaaye nahin gaye hai
 These institutions also give further loans by taking loans, so when they are unable to repay their loan then there will be a shortage of money in the market
 ek tarah se haahaakaar much saktaa he
 The market started falling when it was first reported that ILFS was also defaulting
 asocham ke secetry general udai verma bhi ek tarah se sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 Rajan has also made a statement, like Verma, that the Reserve Bank should inject money to overcome the NBFC crisis
 angreji ke akhabaaron main khub lekh chap rahe hai ki rigerv bank swytt to he magar uskaa bos sarkaar he isliye janhit main sarkaar kii baat manani chahie
 Why the Reserve Bank of India is being pressurized for this money suddenly
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Before making final opinion read the article of Surjeet Bhalla, Prabhat Patnaik
 kai or logon ne bhi likhe hai
 Now talk about Ayodhya
 elahabaad kaa naam badalane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile kaa naam badal diya he
 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya
 loksabhaa kaa naam faizabad he
 Will the name of the Lok Sabha constituency be changed along with this or will the parliamentary constituency be called Faizabad
 bijepi ke hi lallu singh faizabad se saansad hai
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava from Faizabad told that Prime Minister Modi had gone to Faizabad in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, not to Ayodhya
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main faizabad bhi nahin gaye, ayodhya bhi nahin gaye
 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue
 jo bhi he itani badi ghoshnaa ho gai he or shaam chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje tak yani jab prime time shuru hua tab tak pradhanmantri or amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 Both did not congratulate Yogi Adityanath with this big announcement
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ayodhya par twit nahin kiya he, 6 bajkar 40 minute par unka twit aayaa he jisamen dakshin korea kii first ladi kii tasviir he
 He mentions ancient contacts with South Korea and Ayodhya, refers to Ayodhya's program, photo but no tweet has come on Yogi's declarations
 2019 ke naam par 1992 aa rahaa he, sabaki raay aa chuki he, pradhanmantri kii raay nahin ai he
 Will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya? Comments yogi adityanath pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki ayodhya main ram kii pratimaa kaayam karenge
 It will be different from the Ram temple
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha ki ayodhya main ek medical kalege banegaa jiskaa naam rajarshi dasharath par hoga or airport kaa naam purushottam ram ke naam par hoga
 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah
 faizabad kaa naam badla gaya he us par ve kya kehete hai
 So nothing was found on his Twitter handle
 unhone kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko janmdin par badhai di he magar yogi adityanath ke itane bade faisle par bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri modi ne koi twit tak nahin kiya
 Apart from politics, today you should notice the coverage of news channels separately
 screen kaa rang tak badal gaya tha
 Faizabad had a different color, Ayodhya had a different color
 screen par jin pratikon kaa istamaal ho rahaa tha, use samajhane or satark hone kii zarurat he

 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Justice Ranjan Gogoi will retire on November 17 and in his place Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde will become the new Chief Justice of India on November 18
 lekin in 10 dinon main justise gogoi ko kai aise faisle sunaane hai jisase bharat main bahut kuch badal jayega yaa in faislon kaa asar kaaphi 'prabhavakaari' ho saktaa he
 When we talk about the decisions of the Supreme Court coming in the month of November, the Ayodhya dispute first comes to mind
 is maamle kii sunwaayee khatm ho chuki he or justise gogoi ne kaaphi pehle hi kaha tha ki agar is par sunwaayee tay samay main puri ho jaati he to vah november main is par faisla suna sakate hai
 The Ayodhya dispute is more than 100 years old
 supreme court main jahaan vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq ko lekar sunwaayee ho rahi thi to vahiin aam janata ke liye yah aasthaa kaa sabase bada prashn ban gaya he
 Many parties reached the top of power over this dispute, there were many such parties who lost their ground in the rise of Hinduist politics
 is vivaad par faisla supreme court kii sanvaidhanik bench suna sakati he jisaki aguwai pradhan nyaayadhish justise ranjan gogoi kar rahe hai
 Those people who have seen the 90s era can understand the sensitivity behind this decision very well
 piem modi bhi apane mantriyon se apil kar chuke hai ki isko lekar gaiyr jaruri bayaanbaji na karen
 At the same time, the state governments are also engaged in improving the law and order

 aise vakt main, jab congress party loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya str par buree tarah haari he, kerala aisa rajya he jo ab bhi desh kii is sabase puraani party ke saath majbootee se khadaa he
 There are 20 Lok Sabha seats here, out of which the Congress-led UDF alliance has won 19 seats
 congress khud 16siton par chunaav ladi thi or 15 jeet gai
 It is a setback for the ruling Left coalition in the state that the public has given them just one seat
 yah chunaav nateeja sipiai or sipiem ke rashtriya party ke darje par bhi asar daalega
 The bjp-led NDA alliance could not open an account here again
 puure desh main 19 may ko matdaan samaapt hone ke baad india today or exis maai india ne apane eczit pole survey kaa anumaan jari kiya tha
 The survey said that the Congress coalition in the state could win 15-16 seats unilaterally, the LDF alliance could be reduced to 3-5 seats and it would be difficult for the BJP to open an account
 hamaara anumaan thode se parivartan ke saath sach sabit hua
 In 2014, the UDF got 12 seats from here which increased to 19 in this election, while the LDF (left alliance) got a tremendous blow here and was reduced from 8 seats to one seat
 bijepi rajya main apana khaataa kholane main naakaam rahi
 The survey said that the BJP is in the fight in the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat, where it can be expected to open its account, where it stood second
 puure rajya main yah ekmaatr seat he jahaan par bijepi ko duusare number par rahane kii uplabdhi hasil ho saki
 Data from India Today and Axis My India states that the UDF received 47% of the total votes cast in the state, while the LDF came second with 35% votes
 endie gathbandhan ko rajya bhar main kul 16% vot hasil hue hai
 Other parties and candidates got 2% votes
 india today or exis maai india ke survey se pataa chalata he ki agar dharmik aadhaar par dekhen to bhi udief hi rajya main sabase pasandida gathbandhan he
 38% of the Hindu voters voted for the UDF and LDF, while the BJP was able to garner just 21% of the majority of the electorate by giving the Sabarimala case a lot of air
 58% muslim or 56% isai voters ne udief kaa samarthan kiya
 31% and 30% voters from both these communities supported the Left coalition
 bijepi ko muslim samudaay se mahaj 8% or isai samudaay se mahaj 11% vot mili
 However, the LDF received 44% of the votes from other communities, while the UDF received 29% from other communities and the NDA received 26%
 agar aarthik vargeekaran ke aadhaar par matadaataaon kaa rukh dekha jaae to amir varg kii bhi pehali pasand udief hi he
 Over 44% of all economic class voters voted for the Congress alliance
 31,000 se adhik aay varg vaale 55% pariwaron ne congress kaa samarthan kiya
 It is interesting that ldf's vote share is decreasing as monthly income levels rise
 garibi rekha ke neeche aay varg ke 38% voters ne ldf ko vot kiya he
 But LDF support among voters up to 31,000 income groups was reduced by 20%
 bijepi ko bipiel pariwaron se lekar 20,000 aay varg tak ke 16%matadaataaon kaa samarthan he, lekin isse zyada ke aay varg vaale pariwaron main uskaa samarthan 21% he
 The UDF is the coalition with the highest impact among both illiterate and educated voters
 sabhi tarah ke shaikshik varg ke 46%—48% voters udief ko saport karte hai
 The LDF has the support of 40% of the illiterate and 37% of the educated class till the eighth
 aage jaise jaise shiksha kaa str badhata he, 10veen, 12veen, grajuation or post grajuation, ldf kaa samarthan kramash: 34%, 35%, 33% or 30% he
 According to the data, as more and more students move towards the level of education, the number of BJP supporters also increases
 agar matdaaon kii aayu ke aadhaar par dekhen to bhi congress sabhi aayu varg ke matadaataaon kii pehali pasand he
 Talking of the voters who are going to vote for the first time (18-25 years old) to the age of 61 years or more, the Congress has an average of 47% support from all sections
 26-35 saal ke matadaataaon main se 48% kii pasand congress he to isse zyada kii umr ke matadaataaon main congress kaa samarthan ghatakar 45% ho jaataa he
 LDF has the support of 39% first time voters and 38% older voters
 36-50 aayu varg ke matadaataaon main ldf kaa samarthan ghatakar 33% he
 BJP has the support of 17% of voters in the age group of 36-50 and 51-60
 india today or exis maai india kaa survey kahata he ki bijepi pehali baar vot dene ja rahe mahaj 13% voters kii pasand he
 The survey also noted how the political trends of people associated with various businesses in Kerala
 udief or ldf kaa samarthan chaatro ke bich 43% or 42%, kisaanon ke bich 41%-40% or berajagaar matadaataaon ke bich 46%-44% he
 That is, there is a tough competition between these classes in both alliances
 gharelu mahilaon, krishi mazdooron, rickshaw chaalkon or chote dukandaaron ke bich udief, ldf ke mukaable 10 fisadi se zyada lokapriy he
 There is an average of 5-7% difference in popularity of both alliances between laborers, cobblers and skilled professionals
 bijepi ko rickshaw vaale or kushal peshewar matadaataaon main se20% se kuch adhik kaa samarthan hasil he
 The ruling LDF in the state has more support among those associated with government jobs
 50% sarkari karmchaaree ldf kaa samarthan karte hai, jabaki udief ko34% or bijepi ko 13% sarkari karmchaariyon kaa samarthan hasil he
 Although the UDF is ahead with 46% support among the working class professional voters, the BJP has made a tremendous infiltration and loss of LDF among the voters of this class
 privet sector, apana vyavsaay karne vaale or ritred logon ke bich ldf ke mukaable udief kaa samarthan 10% se bhi adhik he
 Although urban and rural areas are extremely difficult to define in a state like Kerala, the UDF is ahead in both areas
 gramin ilaakon main udief ko 48% or ldf ko 35% matadaataaon kaa samarthan hasil he, to shahari ilaakon main udief ko 46% or ldf ko 35% kaa samarthan hasil he
 NDA has 18% voter support in urban area which is 3% more than the support it is getting in rural area
 agar purush matadaataaon kii baat karen to udief ko 48% or ldf ko 33% purush matadaataaon ke vot mili hai
 Although LDF support is 3% higher among women voters, UDF continues to lead in this category too with 45% vote share
 endie ko purush or mahila donon varg se 16%matadaataaon kaa samarthan he

 Jinnah meddling in the controversy, Union Minister V
 ke
 Singh today said that the Muslims who supported putting the picture of the founder of Pakistan in Aligarh Muslim University are insulting their ancestors who rejected the ideology of Jinnah
 videsh rajyamantri ne soshal media par likhe ek post main kaha ki aaj apane purvajon ke kaaran ve bhartiya hai
 The controversy erupted over the photo of Mohammad Ali Jinnah at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), which BJP leaders have demanded to be removed
 unka kahana he ki janata ke dhan se bane santhaan main bharat vibhaajan ke jimmedaar vyakti kii tasviir lagaana sweekaarya nahin he
 On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Mahendra Nath Pandey also said in Aligarh today on the same issue that Jinnah had ruined the country
 kendriya mantri wike singh ne jinna vivaad par kaha, 'yadi aap musalmaan hai or aap jinna kii tasviir apane deevaaron par chaahate hai to yah aapke baap-dadaon kaa ghor apmaan he, jinhone jinna ke vichaaron ko thukraayaa or jinke kaaran aaj aap bhartiya hai
 'singh wrote in his tweet,' If you are a non-muslim and you have jumped in support of him yet because you feel that it is a restriction on your freedom, then think
 kya aap apane ghar kii deevaaron par us vyakti kii tasviir lagaayenge jiske haath aapke swajanon ke rakt se ranjit he?'let us protect our freedom from abuse

 Will those great men today be proud of the way in which you are using your 'freedom' well? # GENERALLYSAYING '' On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Sakshamhendra Nath Pandeyane today said in Aligarh that Jinnah had ruined the country

 is saal iconomic survey ko gulabi rang main chapa gaya he
 This has been done deliberately so as to draw attention to gender discrimination and give a voice to the campaign to stop violence against women
 somvaar ko sansad main pesh kiye gaye aarthik survey main bharat main ling bhed kii samasya, mahilaon ke prati bhedbhaav or bhartiya samaaj main bete kii jarurat se zyada chaah ke bare main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 The Economic Survey states that just as India has jumped several notches in terms of the Ease of Doing Business, similar steps need to be taken in this matter as well
 jisase samaaj main bete or beti ke bich main bhed ko khatm kiya ja sake
 The Economic Survey states that women often do not have the right to decide the birth of children in India
 bharat main mahilaon or purushon ke bich linganupaat ke antar kii baat to aksar kii jaati he lekin iconomic survey main ek nae tareeke se is baat ko uthaaya gaya he
 The survey states that how much the son is wanted in Indian society, it can be gauged from the fact that the last child in any family is a son or daughter
 bharat main jab isaki padtaal kii gai to pataa chalaa ki bharat ke zyaadaatar pariwaron main aakhri baccha bahut badi sankhya main bete hi hai
 That is, people continue to increase their family until their wishes about sons are fulfilled
 yani bahut si aisi ladakiyon kaa janm hota he jinako unka parivaar nahin chahta
 It seems that despite all efforts, the difference between sons and daughters still remains
 iconomic sarveymen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki garbhanirodh ke upaay chunane ke bare main bhi mahilaon ko bharat main adhikaar kam hi mil paata he
 Either men decide about contraceptive measures or women are unable to use them

 The Economic Survey also said that incidents of violence against women have come down compared to earlier
 mahilaon kii barabari ke bare meniconomic sarvene uttar purv ke rajyon kii tarif karte hue kaha he ki uttar purv ke rajyon main mahilaon kii sthiti baaki desh kii tulana main kaaphi behatar he
