 The court has also allowed market regulator Sebi to sell the assets of the companies
 sheersh adaalat ne subrat raay ke saath hi sahaara india real estate carp li or sahaara india houseing investment carp li ke nideshak ravi shankar dube, ashok raay choudhary or vandana bhargav ko bhi 26 farvari ko nyaayalay main vyaktigat rup se hajir hone kaa nirdesh diya he
 a division bench of Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice JS Khehar directed Sebi to sell the Sahara Group's properties whose sale deeds have been handed over to the investors to recover Rs 20,000 crore
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'un sampattiyon ko aap bech sakate hai
 We allow you to sell them and receive money from it
 yadi yah sampatti kisi tarah kii vivaadit hon to aaj company ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla daayar kar sakate hai
 This matter has to be brought to a final conclusion
 ' The judges also questioned the Sahara Group's disregard of judicial orders for the past year and a half
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki sebi in sampattiyon ko nilaam karke dhan praapt kar sakati he
 Sebi's counsel said that the company should sell these assets by itself and deposit the proceeds from it
 is par nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'is sampatti ko bechney main kya pareshaani he
 Auction and get money sampatti kii keemat ko bhul jaaie
 ' nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'ham mahasoos karte hai ki ve (sahaara ke log) aisa nahin karenge or ham un par vishwaas nahin karte hai isliye aap hi kiijie
 The court in its order did not mention the issue of selling the properties
 sheersh adaalat ne 31 disambar, 2012 ko apane faisle main sebi ko sampattiyaan jabt karne or dhan vasuul karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The court gave a clear indication on November 21 last year that the court was not helpless in taking action in the matter of violation of its instructions
 nyaayalay ne subrat raay ke videsh jane par roak lagane ke saath hi samooh ko apni sampatti bechney par bhi pratibandh laga diya tha
 The court also questioned the group's defense that the company had already returned the investors' money
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki bachaav kii is daleel ko pehle hi teen nyaayadhishon kii bench thukraa chuki he or baar baar ise uthaane kii jarurat nahin he
 On behalf of the group, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani said that he would present his side on the next date of hearing after observing the previous orders

 Police has filed a chargesheet in the case of rape and murder of an 81-year-old woman
 mahila ke naukar par hi uskaa galaa ghontne or shav ko jala dene ke aarope hai
 According to the chargesheet, 21-year-old Neeraj Saki tried to mislead neighbors about the woman after sexually assaulting and killing the victim
 vah ghar se nagdi or aabhushan lekar faraar ho gaya
 The magistrate court, taking cognizance of the charge sheet, has sent the file to Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna for further trial
 adaalat ne saki ke khilaaf aaropon par daleelon kii sunwaayee ke liye 24 sitambar kii taarikh tay kii he
 The police claimed in the charge sheet that Saki strangled the woman and strangled her and burnt the body
 aaropee bihar ke madhubani kaa rahane vaala he
 He was arrested on 8 July at the GK-2 residence of Rekha Duggal on charges of murder
 chargeshit ke mutabik, aaropee ne rekha kii hatya karne ke baad carosine daalkar unke shav ko jala diya or paas ke kamare main ghasitkar le gaya
 He then told neighbors that Rekha had not returned from her evening stroll
 police ne ghatnakram ke bare main chargeshit main likhaa he ki aaropee ne pehle mahila se rape kiya or phir unki hatya kar di
 He said, he later burnt his body to destroy the evidence
 usne adaalat ko yah bhi bataaya ki usne ghatana ke baad ghar se keemtee chijen chura leen
 Rekha's husband KK Duggal was a former UNI editor
 unka 2005 main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Incidentally, Manmohan Singh, who has entered politics, has created history and also gave a befitting reply to those who are called weak prime ministers
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon or rujhaanon ke baad manmohan singh ne apane virodhiyon ko shant kar diya he or yah baat bhi sahi he ki un par hamalaa bolne vaali bhaajapa tathaa vam dal ab kuch kehane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 An economist-turned-politician, Singh is called the father of economic reforms in India
 vah paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad ek baar phir pradhanmantri banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Manmohan probably ran a coalition government more efficiently than former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ko 13 maheene baad dobaaraa pradhanmantri banane kaa mauka mila tha lekin manmohan ne paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kiya or phir desh kii bagdor sanbhaalane ja rahe hai
 Manmohan, popularly known as Doctor Saheb among Congressmen, has been one of the top Congress leaders since 1991

 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anna hajaare ke andolan ko bhale hi puure desh main jabardast samarthan mila ho, lekin desh kii duusari hakeekat yah he ki ek bada tabaka na sirf rishwat ko jaij maanata he, balki is par kabja karne ke liye andolan or khooni sangharsh tak ke liye taiyaar he
 Recently two major incidents have occurred in Uttar Pradesh, in which different groups have mobilized, agitated and got into bloody struggle to capture bribery or black money
 lakhimpur khiri main lekhpal or vakeelon ke bich hue khooni sangharsh kii jad main khaas baat yahi thi ki jati praaanpatr yaa is tarah ke dastavej banavaane main hone vaali upree kamai par pehla haq kiskaa he
 On this issue, the lawyers and accountants showed such a mobilization that almost two lawyers got killed and lawyers went on strike all over the state
 aisi hi duusari ghatana bundelkhand ilaake main avaidh khanan ko lekar hui
 In late August, contractors engaged in granite and other types of mining raised a direct demand that they either be exempted from the punk tax or be given a free hand overloading
 is maamle ne itnaa tool pakadaa ki jhaansi, lalitpur, mahoba or banda jilon main 300 kressure maalik hadtaal par chale gaye
 The incident of Lakhimpur Kheri was somewhat like this: On August 29, in the Muhammadi Tehsil office, advocate Shyambabu's scribe went to Lekhpal Adinant Awasthi to get Sushil caste certificate
 shyambabu kaa aarope he ki praaanpatr banavaane ke evaj main lekhpal ne paise kii maang kii
 At the same time, Awasthi alleges that he had spoken about issuing the certificate only after conducting the investigation, while the lawyers were pressurizing him to get the certificate immediately
 isi vajah se vivaad bad gaya or donon pakshon main jamkar marpet hui
 It is alleged that the lawyers beat the Lekhapal fiercely in the Tehsildar's room
 donon pakshon ne ek-duusare ke khilaaf mukademe bhi darj kara die
 After this, swords were drawn at the local level in Avikta Sangh and Lekhpal Sangh
 lekhpal sangh ne marpet ke aaropee vakeelon kii giraftaar kii maang ko lekar hadtaal kii ghoshnaa kar di, to adhivaktaaon ne bhi nyaayik kaam na karne kaa nirnay liya
 The two sides clashed with each other demanding action
 2 sitambar tak yah kram chalata rahaa
 On the afternoon of September 3, Lekhpal was meeting in his association in the tehsil that he had a fight with the lawyers passing there
 vivaad badhane par lekhapaalon ne raifal se vakeelon par firing kar di
 In this incident, advocates Pradeep Dixit and Mukul Tiwari died on the spot and advocates Rahis Ahmed, Anand Gupta, Rajesh Singh and Jitendra Verma were injured
 gardan main goli lagane ke kaaran rahis ahamed kii haalat gambhir thi
 He was sent to the Trauma Center in Lucknow
 is ghatana ne puure pradesh main bhuuchaal laa diya
 Swords were drawn among lawyers and revenue employees across the state
 sabhi tahseelon main kaamkaaj band kar diya gaya
 The strike was announced by the Uttar Pradesh Lekhpal Sangh and the Uttar Pradesh Bar Association
 lekin is ghatana kii asli vajah par gaur karen to pataa chalata he ki sara kaam eemaandaaree se ho rahaa hota to vakil or lekhpal main jhgade kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta, kyonki jati praaanpatr jari karne ke liye koi sarkari fees nahin lagati he
 But in lieu of issuing the same certificate made for free, Rs 50 to 200
 tak dene padate hai
 If a person makes it through a lawyer, then the same money has to be paid as lawyer's fees, while if someone works directly with the government department, then money has to be paid
 tehsil main rojaanaa 200 ke kareeb jati praaanpatr banate hai or kisi sarkari bhartee prakriya ke pehle yah aankada 1,000 tak pahunch jaataa he
 In such a situation, both the lawyers and the accountants want the certificates to be made directly through them and they are ready to go to any extent for this 'right'
 tehsil main jati praaanpatr ke alaava aay praaanpatr or nivas praaanpatr ke liye bhi isi tarah kaa khel chalata he
 As far as this incident is concerned, the situation would not have taken such a violent turn if the administration did not remove the PAC posted in the premises on the morning of the day of September 3
 haalanki jiladhikari hrishikesh bhaskar is tark ko sahi nahin maanate
 But the officials have no answer to the question that by whose order the force was removed from the Tehsil premises? Not only this, Mohammad's Kotwal Yogendra Singh was charged with serious corruption charges a month ago
 lekin un par linehajiri kii karrwai tab jaakar hui jab do vakeelon kii jaan chali gai
 a tehsildar posted in Lakhimpur says that the tahsil Muhammadi bordering Shahjahanpur border has been dominated by lawyers since the beginning
 vakeelon ne yahaan par kai baar adhikariyon va tehsil karmiyon se marpet or abhadrata kii he
 So far SDM Hariram and Tehsildar R

 Nominated reports were filed against 35 people including Sharma
 inamen esadm, tehseeldaar or lekhpal avasthi ke faraar mitra majiulla ko chhod shesh sabhi 32 logon ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya gaya
 After the incident, lawyers demonstrated in all the districts of the state, including Lucknow, and other revenue employees, including the collection Amin, jumped in support of the accountants
 colectrate ke alaava sabhi tehsil karyaalayon main taale latake rahe
 Uttar Pradesh Bar Council member Ajay Kumar Shukla said that no lawyer will contest the case of any accountant
 unhone mrit adhivaktaaon ke parijanon ko 50-50 lakh ru
 Also demanded compensation
 kaise bhadkaa gussamuhammadi tehsil main jati praaanpatr banavaane ko lekar 29 agast ko vakil or lekhpal main tikhi jhdap hui
 Despite deepening the controversy, the PAC was removed from the tehsil on the morning of 3 September and two lawyers were killed later that same day
 hatyakand main 35 log namjad hai, inamen se 32 logon kii giraftaar ho chuki he
 Lawyers have refused to contest his case
 bundelkhand ilaake ke kressure maalik over loding par sakhti or gunda tex se khafa
 Work in more than 300 crushers of the area stalled until demands were met
 udhar, bundelkhand ilaake main stone kressure maalikon or prashasan ke bich vivaad ke chalate hafte bhar se ilaake ke 300 se adhik kressure band pade hai
 The dispute started here in mid-august, when the administration tightened up on overloading of trucks
 isse gussaye kressure maalikon ne shuru main prashasan se maang kii ki yaa to overloding kii ijaajat di jaae yaa phir un par lagane vaala gunda tex band ho
 When the matter was not resolved, 7 associations of the area including the Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot Dham districts went on strike and took to the streets wearing Anna hats
 agar donon pakshon kii ore se lagaae ja rahe aarope-pratyarope or andolan ke samay par najar daalen to donon paksh kahin-na-kahin bhrashtachar main lipt hai
 Pawan Saraogi of the Crusher Owners Association says that in lieu of issuing a copy containing 50 receipts of sales form MM11, Rs
 50,000 from him
 gunda tex ke naam par vasule ja rahe hai, jo saraasar anyaay he
 The crusher owners claim that some goons in the Mining Department's office charge money publicly and have big people on their heads
 vaise, jhansi ke ediem udaibhaan treepathi kaa kahana he, ''koi gunda tex nahin vasula ja rahaa or mem 11 patrak aasaani se uplabdh kara die gaye hai
 "but he was cut off on the question of taking action on the earlier illegal recovery
" kressure maalikon ke gheraav se jujh chuke jhaansi ke esadm pi
 K
 shrivastav kaa kahana he, ''kressure maalik ek hi raseed par 3-4 trakon ko paar karaane kii nazaij maang par ade hai
 Going to the bottom of the case it was revealed that for the 50 receipts of the first MM11, the officials of the Mining Department received Rs 10,000
 rishwat deni padati thi or overloding bhi aaraam se hoti thi
 But now Rs 50,000 as punk tax
 tak lag rahe hai
 "what is being cooked in the crusher owner and mining department is revealed by the Uttar Pradesh Revenue 2009-10 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
 report ke mutabik, khanij jilon main jila colectoron ko khanan ke liye 449 enosi jari kii gayi, lekin in patton se hue khanan ke liye koi transit shulk nahin liya gaya

 53 karod ru
 Revenue loss occurred
 lekin is mileebhagat ke baavjood ekatarfa gunda tex badhane or overloding par lagaam kasne se kressure maalik sadakon par utre, or jab unhen overloding kaa rasta nahin mila to unhone gunda tex ke virodh main andolan ched diya
 The crusher owners' movement has gained a lot due to the support of former minister Baburam's son Rakesh Gupta and former MLC Shyamsunder Yadav
 lekin in andolanon ne ek baat saaf kar di he ki muddat se sarkari dhan kii lut-khasot par pal rahe samaaj ke ek tabake ko yah lut apana moolbhoot adhikaar lagane lagi he
 And to protect this right, they can also kill and die

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mangalvaar ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke saath apni pehali saajha raily kii
 During this time, PM Modi blamed the Congress for taking away Balasaheb Thackeray's right to vote
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress vaale kah rahe hai ki ham deshadroh kaa kanoon hataayenge jabaki congress ne hi balasaheb thakare kii naagarikta chin lee thi, unka matdaan karne kaa adhikaar chin liya tha
 Is the Congress government responsible for trying to touch the sentiments of Shiv Sena voters in Maharashtra by making PM Modi's statement or indeed to snatch the franchise of Balasaheb Thackeray? It is true that Balasaheb Thackeray's name has been in the voter list for 6 years Withdrawal orders were given and for 6 years, their vote and contesting elections were banned, but did the Congress have any role in this
 aaie jaanate hai ki ye ghatana kab hui or aisa hone ke peeche kya vajah rahi
 This case dates back 32 years
 mumbai ke viley parley vidhansabha kshetra main upachunaav ho rahe the
 Shiv Sena and BJP were contesting for the first time together
 is upachunaav me shivasena ke ummidavaar ramesh prabhu congress ke ummidavaar prabhakar kunte ko haraakar jeet gaye
 Prabhakar Kunte filed a petition in the Bombay High Court against the result of the election that Balasaheb and Shiv Sena candidates campaigned in the name of religion and provoked the sentiments of voters
 1991 me bombai hoicourt ne balasaheb or ramesh prabhu ko is maamle me doshi qaraar diya
 The Election Commission was ordered that Balasaheb and Ramesh Prabhu's right to vote be taken away for 6 years and their contested elections also be imposed for 6 years
 is faisle ke khilaaf ramesh prabhu ne supreme court main apil kii
 In 1995, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision
 haalanki is faisle ke baad us vakt ke raashtrapati ne chunaav ayog ke paas is maamle ko salaah ke liye bheja
 The commission constituted a two-member commission
 isamen je
 M
 Lyngdoh and Manohar Singh Gill were
 is kamishan ke suzav ke aadhaar par raashtrapati ne july 1999 main supreme court ke aadesh ko lagu kar diya, jiske chalate unka voter list se naam hataaya gaya
 From 1995 to 2001, Balasaheb Thackeray's poll vote was taken away
 raashtrapati ke faisle ke vakt centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi 
 The central or state government has never played any role in this whole matter
 balasaheb thakare ne is faisle kii ninda kii thi
 Although Balasaheb never contested the elections himself, but due to this decision he could not vote in the 1999 Lok Sabha and Maharashtra assembly elections
 phir 2004 me bain hatane ke baad pehali baar unhone vot daalaa

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke 19 saal ke kaaryakarta kaa shav pashchim bengal ke midanapur jile main ek ped se lataka mila
 Family members of the deceased have blamed the state's ruling party Trinamool Congress for the murder
 jisko lekar bhaajapa samarthakon ne ilaake main pradarshan kiya
 Police said, 'pintu Manna resident of Narangdighi in Pingla, Pintu Manna (19), a resident of Narangdighi in Pingla, has been found hanging from a tree near his house
 shav baraamad kar liya gaya he or postmortem ke liye bheja gaya he
 After this death, BJP supporters demonstrated in the area on Sunday
 unhone sthaneey trinmul congress samarthit gundon par manna kii hatya karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Because Pintu Manna was supporting BJP
 bhaajapa samarthakon kaa kahana he ki manna kii hatya kii gai or uske shav ko baad main lataka diya gaya, jisase yah aatmahatya kii tarah dikhe
 a relative of Manna said, 'our boy was about 10 after dinner at his uncle's house in the neighboring village
 30 baje chalaa, lekin vah ghar nahin pahunchaa
 Around 11 pm, a local man passing through the area saw the dead body hanging from the tree

 However, Trinamool leaders have denied the allegations and said that the BJP is trying to give political color to the death
 trinmul ke pingala ke block adhyaksh ne kaha, 'yuvak ne aatmahatya kii he or bhaajapa isko raajnneetik rang dene kii koshish main he
 Whenever something happens they do it the same way
 ' Stone, mountain, dust is the earth, the earth is the companion of all, this earth of the golden surface encompassing me is my salute, o earth, i have dug you, shall it be beautiful, lifeless again, holy earth, i wish you had pierced my heart, heart no-atharva Veda, 1500-1000 BC Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande at the Climate Change Conference in Paris on 30 November when Ecol Minister of launch jointly a book called Our Vldderts done, they entered the composition would have been left without being convinced of the wisdom of our ancestors who 3,000 years ago, the Earth-hymns of Atharva today
 isse kuch ghante pehle hi duniya ke netaaon ke sabase bade jutan kaa gavaah bane sammelan ke udghaatan samaaroh main oland ne yah chetavanee bhi de di thi, “kisi antarrashtriya baithak main kabhi bhi itnaa kuch daanv par nahin laga hua tha kyonki aaj daanv par hamaari dharti kaa bhavishya he, daanv par he khud jindagi kaa bhavishya
 “the leaders present in Paris were facing an unimaginable truth
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki manushya ne samuhik rup se apane purvajon kii chetavaniyon kii upeksha kii he or dharti kaa seenaa cheer kar uske sansadhano kaa atyadhik dohan kar daalaa he
 Today, the effect of increased temperature is being seen all over the earth and there are signs of destructive and irreversible changes in the Earth's climate
 rah-rah kar mausam ativaadee rukh apana rahaa he jiske chalate vinaashak chakravaat, jowar, sookhaa or baadh ke halaat dekhne main aa rahe hai
 The last 14 years have been witness to the highest temperature rise on this earth and 2015 has been the warmest year till date
 modi ne vahaan jute netaaon se aagrah kiya, “ham chaahate hai ki duniya ise apaat sthiti kii tarah le or pratikriya de
 We want to see in Paris a holistic, equitable and sustainable treaty that can lead us to restore a balance between nature and humanity, between what we have inherited and what we will leave behind
 ”yah harakat main aane kaa vakt tha
 Leaders had to take advantage of this opportunity because it has rarely happened that so many people have put their trust in the palm of some people in this way
 afsos ki in netaaon ne hamaare bharose ko tod diya
 They failed
 jalwaayu parivartan par chal rahi vaartaon ke 21wein daur ke rup main paris main aisa kuch bhi alag nahin hua jo ateet ke gatirodh ko tod paata- vahi ranjishein or vahi nateeja dhak ke teen paat
 The whole battle was divided into two camps: Global North vs South Pole, Conservationists vs Progressives, Earth heaters and steals
 inamen kai the jo ab bhi hare rang (hariyaali kii maang) ko khatre kaa nayaa rang maan rahe the
 It was a war of big corporations vs
 big corporations
 yah kudarat banaam kaarobaar kii jang thi
 One camp believed in first aid and the other thought of having surgery immediately
 kuch log apana angan bachaane main lage the to kuch apane angan main dusron ko nyotaa dene ke hami the
 All these campers soon made it clear that business would take over this earth
 ateet main bhi to aisa hi hota rahaa he
 When the decision will come, the implications were decided at the beginning of the conference
 jalwaayu parivartan par adhyayan karne kii jimmedaar sanstha sanyukt raashtra antarsarkari samiti ne nishkarsh de diya tha ki jalwaayu parivartan ke aparivartaneey sthiti main pahunchane kaa nirnaayak padaav tab aayega jab dharti kaa taapmaana (mul taapmaana se) 2 degree celcius se zyada bad jayega
 The uninterrupted exploitation of fossil fuels such as coal and oil for continuous industrialization for the last 150 years has served to increase the emission of greenhouse gases rapidly
 is taapmaana vruddhi ke chalate dhruvon kii barf teji se pigal rahi he jo duniya kii jalwaayu ko niyamit karti he
 Due to this, the sea level is increasing dangerously and the weather trend is deteriorating
 aise main paris jalwaayu sammelan ko nirnaayak padaav hona tha
 Particularly developed nations arrived here with commitments to reduce their carbon footprint, but as the conference progressed and the promise of emissions reductions rose, it was clear that it would not be possible to reverse the devastation
 Will happen
 sanyukt raashtra jalwaayu parivartan sachivalay kaa akalan tha ki paris main sabhi rashtron ke kiye sankalpon ko mila diya jaae tab bhi dharti ke taapmaana ko 2
 Can be stopped up to 7 degrees, which is a thorn well above the danger mark
 kuch jaankaron kaa kahana he ki adhiktam taapmaana vruddhi kii yah seemaa 3
 Can also go up to 6 degrees
 isse bhi bura yah he ki agar sabhi raashtra apni yojanaon ko lagu karte hai to ve 2030 tak uplabdh do-tihaai carbon bajet kaa upbhog kar jaaenge
 Then they will have to cut their greenhouse gases emissions further in the next 15 years to avoid the destructive effects of climate change
 britain ke pradhanmantri david camran ne sammelan main sahi sawaal uthaaya, “maamla yah nahin he ki ham kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge&ham sab jaanate hai ki aisa hi hoga&sawaal yah he ki ham apni agali peedhishon ko kya jawaab denge agar ham naakaam rahe
 We must say that this work was quite difficult
 phir ve jawaab denge, jab dharti hi khatre main thi to aisi koun-si cheez usase zyada mushkil thi? jab 2015 main samudron kaa jalastr bad rahaa tha, jab fasalein tabah ho rahi thim, jab registan vistaar le rahaa tha, to isse zyada mushkil or kya tha?”aakhir aisi kya baat he jo itani mushkil ban gai he? aakhir ye desh, khaskar sampann desh, qayaamat kaa din kareeb aata dekhakar bhi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main kyon kataraa rahe hai? jalwaayu parivartan ke maamle main itihaas khud ko dohraane kaa aadi rahaa he
 If we do not learn from him, we are doomed to repeat it
 aaj se 23 saal pehle rio ke prithvi sammelan main is duniya ko pehali baar jalwaayu parivartan ke sankat kaa ehsaas hua tha or uske baad jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra dhanchaagat sankalp (yuanegsisi) ko antarrashtriya sandhi bana diya gaya
 Since then, we do not have much to show in the name of progress
 katautee ke lakshya aparyaaptduniya ke netaaon ne 1997 main jab yah mahasoos kiya ki katautee ke lakshya aparyaapt hai, tab ve kioto sandhi par jaakar sahamat hue, jisane viksit deshon ke liye badhyakaari utsarjan katautee lakshya tay kiye
 Its accountability was on those countries because the treaty recognized that they were responsible for the high emissions of greenhouse gases which were the result of their industrial development in the past
 bharat or china jaise vikasshil deshon ne safaltaapurvak “pradooshak kare bhugtan” ke nazariye ko pusht kiya, baavjood iske ki sandhi ke kriyanvayan kaa mul siddhant “samaan lekin alahada jimmedaariyon” kaa tha
 After several rounds of hard negotiations and complex affirmations, this approach was implemented in 2006
 sandhi ne 2008 se 2012 ke bich paanch saal ke liye 1990 ke staron ke mukaable paanch fisadi utsarjan katautee lakshya tay kiya, jo uski vachanabaddhata kaa pehla hissaa tha
 The next phase of commitment begins in 2013 and ends in 2020
 jaankaar maanate hai ki yah sandhi mote taur par naakaam rahi he, kyonki duniya kaa duusare number kaa utsarjak america is vachanabaddhata se yah kehete hue baahar nikal aayaa ki yah sandhi bharat or china jaise vikasshil deshon ko utsarjan katautee ke liye baadhya nahin karti
 Developed countries like Canada, Japan and Russia also pulled back on the US footsteps while other countries continued to weaken its stringent provisions
 iske baad viksit deshon ne svaichhik or aatmaniamak katautee par jor dena shuru kiya
 The move developed in such a way that each country had to express its intention of emission reduction ie Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)
 paris sammelan main viksit deshon ne kioto sandhi ko uski samaapti avadhi 2020 ke baad chupchaap dafna dene kaa tay kiya he or uski jagah ek aisa abadhyakaari samjhauta laayaa jayega jisamen katautee ke lakshya svaichhik honge tathaa har paanch saal par isaki samiksha kaa ek kamjor sankalp shaamil hoga
 Developed countries have retracted two more promises made to developing countries under the UNFCC: providing adequate financing and transfer of technology
 ye praavdhaan garib deshon ko jalwaayu parivartan se ladgaye main madad karne ke liye the taaki unhen praudyogiki hastantaran karke saura or pawan urja jaise akshay sroton kaa dohan karne main madad kii ja sake
 Not enough, after much head-butting on the issue of $ 100 billion finance, developed countries have agreed to give $ 100 billion every year after 2020 to the United Nations Green Climate Fund
 duusari ore bharat or anya vikasshil deshon kaa tark yah he ki jitna paisa diya ja rahaa he, uskaa das guna katautee or anukulan upayon main jaruri hoga
 Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar says, "the commitment of the developed countries to contribute 100 billion dollars shows their duplicity and fraud
 ” kyonki isamen unhone apane maujuuda oversij deveopment assistant (odie) ko jod diya he jabaki vachanabaddhata “nae or atirikt” sansaadhan muhaiyaa karaane kii honi thi
 The bitterness between the countries in Paris will increase because the whole effort is to squeeze the pockets of developed countries more and more which are not ready for this
 iske alaava vikasshil deshon ko unka carbon footprint kam karne main sakasham banane ke liye unhen atyaadhunik harith praudyogiki hastantaran karne main bhi viksit desh kifayat barat rahe hai
 The United States and other developed countries argue that they have done most of the research in green technology in the private sector and in this regard there are issues of intellectual property rights which they cannot violate
 iske alaava, saste main harith praudyogiki kaa hastantaran karne se bazaar ko nuksaan pahonchega or is kshetra main udyog nivesh karne se kataraaenge
 On the issue of IPR, India has said that its royalty can be paid from the GCF fund and the purchased technology can be given on subsidy to all developing countries
 is maang par bhi shaayad hi koi nayaa faisla dekhne ko milegaa
 During this time, developed countries have done a lot of work to break the unity of developing countries on the issue of climate during the last few years
 china aaj greenhouse gaison kaa sabase bada utsarjak banakar ubhara he or china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ne america raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath milakar paris sammelan se pehle kaaphi chaturaai ke saath apana carbon footprint kam karne sambandhi vachanabaddhata kii ek ahm ghoshnaa kar daali he
 After China has entered the American court, the whole target is towards India, which the developing countries have considered as a game-destroying element
 bharat kaa kahana he ki uski salanaa prati vyakti urja khapat behad kam he&vaishvik ausat kaa ek-tihaai or america ke mukaable 20 guna kam
 It may be the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, but its contribution to global emissions is only 6 per cent, compared to 25 per cent in China, 13 per cent in the US and 10 per cent in Europe
 samasya bharat ke kaaran nahin, america ke chalate he, jisane vaadon ko todaa he
 Obama also acknowledged, "I am here as the leader of the world's largest economy and second largest emitter country
" america jalwaayu parivartan main na sirf apni bhoomika ko maanata he balki is disha main kuch karne kaa mahatv bhi samajhataa he
 "however, America's commitments are always viewed with suspicion
 dilli kii sanstha centre for science and anvyranment (siesai) “captain america” naam kii haalia report main kahati he ki 2025 tak greenhouse gaison ko 2005 ke staron ke mukaable 26-28 fisadi tak kam karne kii obama kii ghoshnaa farji thi
 It was also significantly lower than its past commitments and was a mere 13% reduction from the 1990 levels
 america samet baaki duniya bharat ke paksh kii aalochana kar rahi he or usne is baat par chintaa jataai he ki vah apana carbon footprint badhayega
 US Secretary of State John Kerry called India "a challenge"
 javdekar bataate hai ki kaise neuyork main haal main hue sasteneble deveopment summit ke dauraan dopaher ke bhojan par vahaan aae pratinidhiyon ko bachi hui saamagree milakar banaae gaye vyanjan jaise “landphil salad” or “spaintgrain bread” parose gaye lekin kerri ko murge kaa ek vishesh vyanjan diya gaya
 Javadekar says, "america wants us to keep our promise while it doesn't want to make any promise itself
" ”121 deshon ke saura urja gathjodparis main modi ne bahut chaturaai se gend pashchimi deshon ke paale main daal di jab unhone kark or makar rekha ke bich sthit 121 deshon ke saura urja gathjod kaa elaan kiya
 This ambitious alliance will support the demand to bring down the price of solar power technology by making it competitive with coal-fired thermal power plants
 unhone sammelan main jab bharat ke iandisi ko pesh kiya, to modi ne vaada kiya ki 2030 tak bharat kii 40 fisadi bijli gaiyr-jeevashm aadhaarit urja sroton se aegi
 He demanded that the carbon space occupied by the West be vacated for developing countries like India, because even today thermal power plants are the cheapest means of generating electricity
 ise “climet justise” (jalwaayu nyaay) kaa naam dekar unhone kaha ki aise sanyantr 30 karod logon yani ek-chauthai bharat ko bijli dene ke kaam aate hai jinaki ab bhi urja ke kisi vishwasaneey strot tak pahunch nahin he
 What will be the result of Paris? The four pillars on which any agreement to be in everyone's interest - cuts, adaptation, finance and technology - are weak in their own right
 kerri spasht hai ki america kioto jaisi kisi kanoonee rup se badhyakaari sandhi par raji nahin hoga
 Developed countries will continue to maintain a conservative attitude on the issue of providing finance and technology
 paris main vachanabaddhataon ke is tarah bharbharaane par siesai ke up-mahanideshak chandrabhushan kaa akalan he, “philhal yah kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch rahaa he
 We will gather again after five years for a new treaty
 ” aise satahi prayaas duniya ko tabaahi kii ore or tej dhakelenge
 Paris is still mourning the recent terrorist attack, far from the airfield in La Bourge where the conference was being held in modified hangars
 bhay kaa maahaul chanta nahin he or desh immergency kii haalat main he
 Demonstrators who are usually seen at climate conventions were stopped at the beautiful Place de la Republique this time and were not allowed to take to the streets
 paris ko dekhakar saaf lag rahaa tha ki duniya ke saamne philhal do chunautiyaan hai&badhata aatank or jalwaayu parivartan
 Hollande had also said, "I cannot separate the battles against terrorism and climate change
 hamen apane bacchon ko ek aisi duniya main chhod janaa he jo aatank se mukt ho
 We have to give them a land which is safe from destruction
 ”jaahir he, in donon khataron se suvidhaparasti ke saath nahin nibata ja saktaa
 When asked about the outcome of the Paris conference, it is better to quote lines from a poem by Matthew Arnold from India, chief negotiator and central environment secretary, Ashok Lavasa, on behalf of India at the conference, saying something like this: i am a dead person Lok kasir ki nahin hain kahlak hapless kohan takaan who has not been born yet weep on their faith, i laugh at my wait Areas are padhein :jab ramdhaari singh dinakar ne is kavi se kaha, tumne abhi ‘aatmajayi’ likh daali he to budhaape main kya likhoge!’ The new Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh, Anup Chandra Pandey, will take over his office today

 On October 10, Pakistan's National Security Committee held a meeting in Islamabad to take stock of a strategy to deal with and escalate tensions at the border with India, so Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had only this stand for his military-security establishment -the message was: "jung is not an option
 ”sharif agar dil se isamen bharosa karte hai to unase ummid kii jaati he ki ve donon ore ubaal maar rahi bhaawanaaon ko thanda karne kii koshish bhi karenge
 It is a matter of fact that due to domestic constraints and aggressive attitude of Narendra Modi's new government in India in the near future, he will not be able to take any peace initiative
 kashmir kii seemaa par ladaai kaise bhadki, ise lekar pakistan main ab bhi bhram he
 The situation is that India is now accusing Pakistan of sending terrorists to Jammu and Kashmir under the cover of shelling, while the Pakistani rulers are blaming India's aggressive attitude which it has made to its distressed neighbors, especially Pakistan
 Is kept
 sharif hameshaa se bharat ke saath achche rishton ke hami rahe hai
 Even before he came to power last year, he called for a commercial relationship with India, which his critics say is not intended to derail the country's poor economy, but to expand his own business empire Had to do
 sharif apane pichley kaarykaal main pakistan kii bharat ke prati niti ke masale par faujee generalon ke saath lagaataar raar thaane rahe hai or is baar bhi suraksha pratishthan kii salaah ko nazarandaaj karte hue ve may main modi ke shapath samaaroh main bharat gaye the

 Mahmood Shah, a former Pakistani military brigadier and security analyst, says, "nawaz Sharif's India policy has failed
 agar doosraa paksh aapako lagaataar halke main le rahaa ho to sulah kii niti kaam nahin aati
 ”pakistani army officers are surprised by the use of heavy force from India
 unka kahana he ki pichley kuch dashakon main is baar yah sabase tikhaa hamalaa he
 Major General Tahir Javed Khan, director general of the Punjab Rangers, which oversees the Line of Control — which Pakistan calls the international border — in the Sylakot sector, says Indian forces have fired 20,000 shells this year, compared to 200 just two years ago
 khan kaa kahana he ki is baar jab tanaav shuru hua yani 20 sitambar se hi ve bharat main biguef pramukh ke saath flag meeting yojit karne kii koshish main jute hai, lekin unhen kamyaabi nahin mili
 Finally, on 14 October, the dgmos of the two countries spoke on the hotline, but hours after that the Pakistani army reported that four children were badly injured in Pakistan's shelling

 (nawaz Sharif presiding at the National Security Committee meeting in Islamabad) Pointing to the remarks made on Kashmir in Sharif's address to the UN General Assembly in New York, analysts say that it was the attitude of Pakistani leaders over the years Was different from
 iske pehle pakistani netaaon ne kashmir par apane paksh ko is ummid main halkaa kar diya tha taaki vivaad ke hal ke liye bharat ko raji kiya ja sake

 com / d9mezy5g0q bijepi ke firebrands netaa yogi adityanath ne jab se uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri pad sambhala he uske baad se unki lokapriyata main lagaataar ijapha hota aayaa he
 CM Yogi's position in the party is also increasing steadily
 yahaan tak ki jis rajya main vidhansabha ke chunaav hote hai, vah bijepi ke star prachaarkon main rahete hai
 You can gauge his popularity with the fact that on Twitter he is seen beating big leaders
 twitor par trend kar rahe netaaon kii suchi agar dekhen to yogi adityanath bahut teji se lokapriyata kii seedhiyaan chadhate ja rahe hai
 Twitter has released its statistics on the most searched and watched leaders
 isamen yogi adityanath chauthe number par hai
 Prime Minister Modi is preceded by CM Yogi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and BJP President Amit Shah
 chaar rajyon main 70 sabhaayenmadhya pradesh, rajasthan, telugana or chhattisgarh main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav main yogi bijepi ke chunavi campan main ahm cheharaa rahe
 Yogi Adityanath alone held 70 meetings in four of the five states
 siem yogi ne sabase zyada 26 chunavi sabhaayen rajasthan main kin
 At the same time, he held 19 election meetings in Chhattisgarh
 madhya pradesh main unhone 17 chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 At the same time, CM Yogi had 8 meetings in Telangana
 bataa den ki siem yogi kii 70 sabhaaon main zyaadaatar sabhaayen aisi jagahon par huin jo hindutv ke lihaaj se bijepi ke liye mufeed ho sakati thi
 That means such seats were chosen where Hindutva, temple, saffron was an issue and there was more Muslim population
 isse pehleyogi adityanathane karnataka or gujaratvidhansabha chunaavamein bhi kai sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 According to the data, BJP won 26 out of 35 seats in Gujarat where Yogi held meetings
 karnataka main bhi yogi kii sabhaaon or seat kii jeet kaa anupaat duusare netaaon se behatar rahaa
 The demand of Yogi Adityanath as a star campaigner is coming from all the states of the country and the BJP is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on it
 aap is baat se andaja se laga sakate hai ki pashchim bengal main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii rath yatra ke saath-saath yogi adityanath kii ek rath yatra kii maang bhi kii gai he
 Yogi Adityanath's special type of saffron attire, Kundaldhari in ears and his devotees associated with Gorakhnath Peeth across the country make him special
 gorakhnath peeth kii shakhaaen desh bhar main faili he or yahi vajah he ki puure desh main yogi adityanath kii pahchaan fire brands leader ke alaava hindutv ke poster bvoy kii ban gai he
 According to party spokesperson Dr
 Chandramohan, the demand for Yogi Adityanath has increased after the elections in Karnataka and Gujarat
 party ke saath-saath pratyaashee bhi yogi kii sabhaayen maangane lage hai
 It is the growing popularity of the CM that the opposition is as much an attacker on him as it is on other big leaders of the BJP

 Team India's ODI and T20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, saying that the bowler has 'pulled out' of the team on several occasions
 dhoni ne vankhede stadium main tamilnadu ke is gendbaaj ko ipel ke shuruaati match main keval ek over or vah bhi 16waan over diya tha
 The new IPL team Rising Pune Supergiants defeated defending champions Mumbai Indians by nine wickets in this match
 ‘aswin kisi bhi samay kar saktaa he bowling’world tii20 se hi dhoni aswin se kisi tarah ke kathith matbhed kii baat saaf kar rahe hai, unhone kaha, ‘jaisaa ki maine kaha he, aswin ne mujhe kai maukon par mushkil se baahar nikaala he, bhale hi pehle chah over main gendbaaji karnaa ho yaa antim overon main
 He is a bowler who can come and bowl at any time

" aswin paripakv gendbaaj he
 He can bowl at any time
 aisa bhi kshan tha jab mumbai indiens ne kuch wicket ganvaa die the or unke madhya or nichle madhyakram par dabaav tha
 The Ranchi superstar explained how the Mumbai Indians team was struggling with losing four wickets for 30 runs in five overs and thought that debutant leg-spinner Murugan Ashwin would have to complete the entire four-over bowling quota and This was the ideal time to get nervous from this young man's mind
 ‘aswin dabaav mahasoos kar rahaa tha’dhoni ne kaha, ‘yah leg spinner aswin ko laane kaa bahut acha manch tha
 You must have seen the match, you can see that he is not a bowler who throws a lot of short balls, but he was feeling pressured
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe laga ki mere liye wo chaar over use dena kaaphi ahm tha kyonki lambey samay main mujhe wicket chatakaane vaale gendbaaj ke vikalp ke rup main uski jarurat hogi or mujhe laga ki us samay main use wo chaar over de saktaa tha isse use shaayad duusare or tisare match main vaapasi kaa aatmavishvaas milegaa
 Dhoni said, 'it was a process of giving him confidence, but at the same time we were attacking from the other side, Rajat Bhatia was bowling well using the situation, that was why Ravichandran Ashwin was given an over
 And after that i thought that bowling with fast bowlers would be a better option
 ’dhoni, aswin ke bich matbhed!dhoni ne 31 march ko westeindies ke khilaaf world tii20 semifinal main bhi is of spinner kaa kam istemaal kiya tha or is ghatana ne donon ke bich matbhedon kii atakalon ko hawa de di
 The wind in this fire was given by The s Jawab in a press conference held on April 7 before Ashwin's IPL match in which he said that he did not bowl in the match when there was dew in the semi-final match against West Indies
 westeindies se haarane ke baad dhoni ne kaha tha ki unhone aswin ko shuru main do over dene ke baad dobaaraa gendbaaji ke liqush nahin bulaayaa kyonki unhen laga ki os gend ko geela kar rahi thi or is spinner ko gend pakadaney main mushkil ho rahi thi
 Ashwin had conceded 20 runs in his two overs and had bowled a no ball on which 'man of the Match' Lendl Simmons was caught out but was called back to the crease due to a no ball

 Though on Friday, Gadkari clarified that India is still blocking its share of water from going to Pakistan, but it may also consider stopping the entire water of rivers going to Pakistan
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya he puraa maamla
 On Thursday, Gadkari said, "our government under the leadership of PM Modi has decided that we will stop our partnered waters from going to Pakistan
" ham is jal ko purvi nadiyon kii taraf bhej denge or ise jammu-kashmir tathaa punjab ke logon ko laabh pahunchaayenge
 'under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Sri @ narendramodiji, Our Govt
 has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan
 We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab
 — Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari)february 21, 2019unhone kaha, ‘shahpur-kandi main raavi nadi par baandh banane kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he
 In the UJH project we will collect our share of water, which can be used in Jammu and Kashmir
 shesh jal raavi-beas link se behate hue anya rajyon ke logon tak pahunchaaya jayega
 'PM will take decision! After this, while giving clarification, Gadkari said on Friday,' The decision is not only for my department sarkaar or piem ke level par nirnay hoga
 i have told my department to prepare the technical design of the water that is going to Pakistan for their rights, where they can be stopped
 ’unhone pakistan par chot karte hue kaha, ‘agar isi tarah wo vyavhaar karenge or aatankwaad kaa samarthan karenge to phir unke saath maanavtaa kaa vyavhaar karne kaa kya matlab he?’kya ab shuru hoga water war?gadakari ne kaha ki abhi bharat ke apane hisse kaa jo atirikt pani bahakar pakistan chalaa jaataa he use roka jayega, lekin samoochee nadiyon kaa pani rokna he yaa nahin iske bare main sarkaar or piem nirnay karenge
 The Indus and its tributaries run through four countries and serve the water needs of more than 21 crore population
 kya he sindhu jal samjhautasindhu jal samjhaute ke tahat sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke jal ke zyaadaatar hisse par ab bhi pakistan kaa niyantran he
 So far, India has not really done anything in the matter of water and such statements have been used only to warn Pakistan
 sindhu basin kii chah nadiyaan (sindhu, chenab, kishanganga, raavi, satluj, beas) vastav main tibet se nikalakar aati hai or himalay kii talahatiyon se hoti hui pakistani shahar karachi ke dakshin main arab sagar main jaakar milti hai
 Soon after independence, an agreement was reached on May 4, 1948, stating that India would provide sufficient water to Pakistan in exchange for an annual payment
 is maamle kaa sthaayee samaadhaan talashne ke liye kareeb nau saal tak prayaas ke baad 1960 main vishwa bank ke hastkshep se donon deshon ke bich samjhauta hua
 The agreement was signed on 19 September 1960 by the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and the then President of Pakistan Ayub Khan
 is samjhaute ke tahat sindhu basin se bahakar aane vaali sabhi chah nadiyon ke jal vitaran ke liye donon deshon main samjhauta kiya gaya
 The water of these rivers goes from India to Pakistan, so India has a heavy upper hand in this case to stop the water of the rivers
 isko dekhte hue hi in sabhi nadiyon ke jal ke vitaran ke liye sindhu jal samjhauta kiya gaya
 Under this, Pakistan was given the right to control most of the water of the three rivers (jhelum, Chenab, Indus) and India to get more water from the three eastern rivers Ravi, Beas and Sutlej
 purvi teen nadiyon ke jal kaa abaadh tareeke se puure istemaal kaa adhikaar bharat ke paas rahegaa
 Similarly, Pakistan will continue to have the right to use the water of the western three rivers (jhelum, Chenab, Indus) in a free manner
 samjhaute main kaha gaya he ki kuch khaas maamalon ko chhodkar bharat pashchim kii teen nadiyon main jal sangrahan yani dam banane yaa sinchai system ke nirmaan kaa kaam nahin kar saktaa
 There is no technical description about what those particular circumstances will be and this is the root of the dispute between the two countries
 bharat kaa kahana he ki kuch khaas maamalon main nirmaan kii ijaajat he or pakistan apni dushmani kii vajah se jaan boojh kar bharat ko rokane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Under the Indus Water Agreement, India gets 20 per cent of the Indus Basin's rivers, or about 33 million acre feet (MAF) of water, while Pakistan gets 80 per cent, or 125 MAF of water

 iske alaava bharat 1

 As per the agreement, India has been allowed to use moderate water flow of the eastern three rivers Beas, Ravi and Sutlej, while Pakistan has been permitted to use 80 MAF of the western rivers Indus, Chenab and Jhelum
 bharat ko sinchai, bijli utpaadan , gharelu or audyogic aadi jaruraton ke liye pashchimi teen nadiyon ke simit istemaal kii ijaajat di gai he
 India uses 93 to 94 per cent of its share received under the Indus Water Agreement and has to leave the rest, which Pakistan gets
 isi 6 se 7 fisadi jal ko rokane kii baat kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kar rahe hai
 As per the agreement, the water commissioners of India and Pakistan have to hold a meeting every two years and arrange visits of technical experts on their respective project sites and other important works on the rivers
 donon desh ek-duusare ko jal pravaah kaa vivaran or jal kii maatra ke bare main vivaran saajha karnaa hota he
 The agreement cannot be broken! The Indus Agreement is an international agreement signed by the World Bank, so it cannot be broken unilaterally
 ise todane yaa badalane ke liye donon deshon ko milakar baat kerani hogi
 The dam that remained India is approved by the Government of India to build a total of seven dams on Chenab, a 900 km long tributary of the Indus
 bharat sarkaar kishanganga nadi par kishanganga or chenab nadi par ratal panbizli sanyantr kaa nirmaan kar rahi he
 Pakistan has been questioning the Salal hydroelectric project, Tulbul project, Kishanganga and Ratal project to be built on Chenab
 kishanganga pariyojna saal 2007 main shuru kii gai thi or iske nirmaan par kareeb 86
 It is going to cost $ 40 million
 chenab nadi par bane 450 megawatt ke bagalihar dam kaa udghaatan saal 2008 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kiya tha
 a 330 MW Hydro Electric Power Project (KHEP) is being constructed at kishanganga-jhelum Link, which is called Tulbul Project
 iske dwaara ek nahar banaakar kishanganga kaa pani wooler jhil yani jhelum nadi kii ore mode diya jayega
 Pakistan's problematic lake is the largest freshwater lake in Asia

 Pakistan fears that the water diverted from the Indian hydropower project will make it difficult to get water for its project
 ise lekar pakistan saal 2010 main antarrashtriya arbitreshan court chalaa gaya tha, jiske baad saal 2013 main court ne yah aadesh diya ki bharat is project kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, lekin shart bas yah rakhi gai ki pakistan ko 9 cubic meter prati second ke nunatam jal aapurti ke niyam kaa paalan karte rahanaa hoga
 Pakistan is also constructing a 980 MW Sapphire Jhelum HEP on the Neelum River, through which its water will be diverted and sent to the Jhelum

 At the Indus Commission meeting in September 2013, Pakistan also objected to its construction

 video-mishan 2019 intro : dilli sarkaar ne nahin ghataae tel ke daam Bombay High Court has ordered, now police and government departments do not tell the media who the accused are
 wo kya karata he, kahaan rahata he
 What crime he has committed kya dharaaen police ne lagaai hai
 Neither the picture will be seen anymore nor his profile
 yani ab jo bhi khoj khabar kerani he wo media kare, police usamen kuch bhi jaankaree nahin degi
 Neither will it tell what is wrong or right
 pabandi media par nahin balki un agenciyon par he jo media ke zariye baat karti hai
 Gives information about the accused
 pehali nazar main ye lag saktaa he ki jab tak aarope siddh na ho jaae tab tak kisi kii tasviir chhapane kaa haq media ko kaise mil saktaa he
 And it is good that the court has now given the order
 pehali nazar main ye bhi lagata he ki is sabase media trial rukegaa
 The petitioner has argued that the police disrespect the accused by giving photographs of the accused, personal things about him and details of the case
 adaalat ne in sabake maddenjar kah diya he ki aarope patr daakhil hone tak koi jaankaree saajha naa kii jaae
 Has left the media on its condition
 agar aaropee kii tasviir or jaankaree kii mil jaae to wo chhap le, dikhaa le
 It seems that all these arguments have ignored a scale of media and justice
 haal hi main hamane ek story dikhaai thi jisamen ek bade police afasar par ek model ne balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 When the matter came up in the media, the government suspended
 model ne media main aakar dhamkee kii shikaayat kii to peedit kaa khyaal rakhaa gaya
 Now consider the situation, when a police officer complains, and the department is not ready to give information about it
 
 
 na bataae ki wo koun he
 Is it not possible that after one complaint, by seeing the pictures of the accused and the victims can come forward? Can we imagine a system in which we have no official knowledge about the accusations and victims of big, influential people
 ham sawaal na uthaa saken ki koun si dharaaen kyon lagaai gayi he?tippaniyan The order says that information about the accused should not be shared until the charge sheet is filed
 
 
 to kya ham aarope patr ko kisi ke gunaahagaar hone naa yaa naa hone kaa paimaana maan rahe hai? or tab kya hoga jab koi vyakti gambhir aparaadh kar faraar ho jaae, kya us aaropee kii tasveeron par bhi pabandi hogi? phir aparaadh par lagaam kaise lagegi? kya ham aisa system taiyaar nahin kar rahe jahaan bina aadhikarik pushti ke media khabaren dikhayega? kya isse reporting kii galatiyaan or nahin badhengi? There is already a system of not showing the victims in the media, and now there is a decree not to show the accused
 ye aadesh police se un tamaam dabaavon ko kam karata he jo media samaaj kii ore se insaaf ke haq main laata he
 How can we imagine the time when we are not told officially on which big star has crushed people by drinking liquor last night
 
 
 hamen kyon naa jaankaree mili ki gaadi main koun-koun tha or koun faraar he
 Would such a system not weaken the victims further? It can be assumed that there should not be a media trial, but how can the scale of stopping a media trial be canned by information? yani ab jo bhi khoj khabar kerani he wo media kare, police usamen kuch bhi jaankaree nahin degi
 Neither will it tell what is wrong or right

 The court has said in view of all this that no information should be shared till the charge sheet is filed
 media ko uske haal par chhod diya he
 If you get the photograph and information of the accused, then they can print it and show it
 lagata he ki in puri daleelon main media or insaaf ke ek paimaane ko andekha kiya gaya he
 Recently, we showed a story in which a senior police officer was accused of rape by a model
 media main maamla aayaa to sarkaar ne nilamban kiya
 When the model came to the media and complained about the threat, the victim was taken care of
 ab farz kijiye us halaat kii jab, kisi police officer kii shikaayat ho to or mahakama uski jaankaree dene ko taiyaar na ho
 
 
 Do not tell who she is
 kya ye sambhav nahin ki kisi ek shikaayat ke baad, aaropee kii tasviren dekhakar or peedit saamne aa sakate hai? kya ham kalpana kar sakate hai aise system kii jisamen bade, rasukhdaar logon ke aaropon or peediton ke bare main aadhikarik taur par hamen kuch pataa na ho
 We cannot raise the question as to which clauses are imposed? Comments aadesh kahata he ki jab tak aarope patr daakhil na ho tab tak aaropee ke bare main jaankaree saajha na kii jaae
 
 
 So are we treating the charge sheet as a measure of whether or not someone is guilty? And what will happen when a person escapes after committing a serious crime, will the photographs of that accused be banned? Then how will crime be curbed? Are we not creating a system where media will show news without official confirmation? Will reporting mistakes not increase further? media main peediton ko naa dikhaane kii ek vyavastha pehle se hi he, or ab aaropee ko naa dikhaane kaa farmaan he
 This order reduces all the pressures from the police that the media brings to justice on behalf of society
 ham kaise kalpana kar sakate hai us vakt kii jab hamen aadhikarik par ye naa bataaya jaae ki beeti raat kis bade sitare ne daaru pikar logon ko kuchal diya he
 
 
 Why don't we get information about who was in the car and who is absconding
 kya aisi vyavastha peediton ko or kamazor nahin karegi? ye mana ja saktaa he ki media trial nahin hona chaiye, lekin media trial rokane kaa paimaana jaankaree ko dibba band karnaa kaise ho saktaa he? It seems that all these arguments have ignored a scale of media and justice

 Ishant Sharma was once again seen in great enthusiasm in the third Test of the india-sri Lanka series being played at the SSC Club ground in Colombo
 is baar ve gendbaaji ke dauraan nahin, balki ballebaaji ke samay srilankai gendbaaj se bhid gaye
 In this series, he was seen more aggressive, furious and angry at times
 haalanki itnaa gussa unke liye baari pad saktaa he or isisi kii kadi sajaa bhi bhugatni pad sakati he, kyonki is siries main hi un par baari jurmaana lag chukaa he
 He also showed the same aggression in bowling and also took five wickets in the first innings of this Test
 kahin yah captain viraat kohli kii aakraamakata kaa to asar nahin he, jo hameshaa aakraamak rahane kii baat karte hai
 It happened that in the 77th over of India's second innings, Dhammika Prasad threw a bouncer to Ishant, during this time the third ball was no ball
 is par prasad kii ore dekhakar eshanth muskaraa die, phir kya tha prasad ko gussa aa gaya
 After this, Ishant gestured Prasad to hit the ball on his helmet while hitting his helmet while taking a run
 bas phir kya tha, donon main jamkar kahasuni ho gai
 Eventually the umpires and fellow players had to intervene
 bhartiya pari ke 274 ran par samaapt hone ke baad eshanth ke pavilion lautate samay maithyuj ke ishaara karne par dhammika bhi eshanth ke peeche-peeche daude or sidhiyon par unase baat kii
 Significantly, in this series even before this, Ishant has been in discussion about his anger
 isi test ke tisare din bhi eshanth gendbaaji karne ke dauraan srilankai ballebaaj rangana herath se bhid gaye the, vahiin kusal perera se bhi unki bahes hui thi
 Ishant had a few splashes at the start of his innings and after that, Kusal Perera pavilion returned to his ball
 tippaniyan After the third day's play was over, when Kushal Perera was asked about Ishant Sharma's tension, he deferred the matter by saying 'no comments'
 vahiin duusari ore eshanth sharma ne is vaakye par mazaakia andaaj main kaha, 'maine to kusal perera se bas ye poocha tha ki ve dinar kitne baje lete hai?' Significantly, in the second Test match, due to his anger and high enthusiasm, he was fined 65 percent of the match fees
 unhone yahi aakraamakata gendbaaji main bhi dikhaai or is test kii pehali pari main paanch wicket bhi jatke
 Somewhere it is not the impact of the aggressiveness of captain Virat Kohli, who always talks about being aggressive
 hua yah ki bharat kii duusari pari ke 77wein over main dhammika prasad ne eshanth ko bounsar phenki, is dauraan teesri gend no ball ho gai
 Looking at Prasad, Ishant smiled, then what happened was Prasad got angry
 iske baad eshanth ne ran lete samay apane helmet par haath maarthe hue prasad ko unke helmet par gend maarane kaa ishaara kiya
 What was the other thing, both of them became fierce
 aakhir main ampiron or saathi khilaadiyon ko bich-bachaav karnaa padaa
 After Ishant's return to the pavilion ended 274, Dhamika also followed Ishant at the behest of Mathews and spoke to him on the stairs
 gauratlab he ki is siries main isse pehle bhi eshanth apane gusse ko lekar charchaa main rahe hai
 On the third day of the same Test, Ishant had clashed with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath while bowling, while he also had an argument with Kusal Perera
 eshanth ne unki pari kii shuruyaat main un par kuch chhinte kase the or iske baad aakhir main unki gend par hi kusal perera pavilion laute
 The comments tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kusal perera se jab eshanth sharma se tanatani ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone 'no caments' kahkar baat ko taal diya
 On the other hand, Ishant Sharma said in a funny manner on this statement, 'I just asked Kusal Perera at what time do they take dinner?' gauratlab he ki duusare test match main apane gusse or zyada josh ke kaaran un par match fees kaa 65 fisadi jurmaana lagaaya tha

 pashchim bengal main 34 saal se sattarudh vam morcha shashan ke is baar parivartan kii lahar main shuukravaar ko bah jane kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 However, communist leaders still hope that their fort may survive a complete collapse even after much damage
 2006 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sattarudh vam morcha kii jabardast jeet ke baad 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam or aankade rajya main parivartan kii bayaar kii vishleshkon kii bhavishyavaanee ko pusht karte dikh rahe hai
 Compared to the results of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front not only lost 20 seats in 2009, but also saw a drop in its vote percentage by about seven percent
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vammorcha ne rajya kii 42 main 35 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 The Trinamool led by Mamata Banerjee suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Left Front in the 2006 assembly elections in the state
 294 siton par hue matdaan main vammorcha ko 235 siten mili thi, jabaki trinmul congress ko mahaj 29 siton se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 However, three years later, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI-M got just six of the 42 seats in the state, while the Trinamool Congress got 19 and its ally Congress got six seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke anuroop in siton ko vidhansabha seat ke rup main badalane par vammorcha ke ghatakar 101 or congress or trinmul congress gathbandhan ke 190 se adhik seat jeetne kaa anumaan he
 In the 2006 assembly elections, the CPI-M alone got the maximum 175 seats and gained 32 seats compared to the 2001 elections
 jab sitambar, 2018 main supreme court ne nijee vyavsaayik sansthaaon ko logon kii pahchaan pramanit karne ke liye aadhaar ke upyog kii anumati dene vaale aadhaar adhinium kii dhara 57 ko radd kar diya tha, to digital activist or niztaa ke pairokaron ko aanshik jeet kaa ehsaas hua tha
 The ruling was seen as a limited restriction on Aadhaar as the court also upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar for the purposes of identifying the beneficiaries of the government's welfare schemes
 aalochakon ne us faisle par bhi sawaal khadte hue yah tark diya tha ki sarkari or ardh-sarkari agenciyon ke paas nagarikon ke data kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye jaruri takneekee yogyata hi nahin he
 No such information of data theft has been reported directly from the central database of Aadhaar, but the security system of companies and government departments which have the provision of providing Aadhaar numbers is not strong
 18 farvari ko francisi suraksha shodhakarta robert baptist ne daawa kiya ki unhone aadhaar main ek badi suraksha chook pai he, jisase sarkari company indian oil korporation ke swaamitv vaali alpiji brands inden ke lakhon graahakon ke aadhaar data kaa khulaasa ho jaataa he
 Robert is known in the online world as Elliot Alderson (the hacker protagonist of the popular television show Mr
 Robot)
 unhone bataaya ki graahakon ke vivaran, hajaaron dealron or vitarakon kii ore se acces kiye jane vaale portal par uplabdh the or us tak pahunchane ke liye keval ek vaid upyogkarta ke naam tathaa password kii jarurat thi
 Alderson has previously highlighted flaws in the security of Aadhaar data
 unhone kaha, ''sthaneey dealron ke portal main pramanikaran kii kami ke kaaran, inden apane graahakon ke naam, pate or aadhaar sankhya ko li kar rahaa he
 This gas and energy company was also found leaking data from one end with direct connections to the Aadhaar database last year
 vaise, is baar data kaa yah licage uske apane graahakon tak hi simit he
 Earlier this month, a report was published in us-based website techcrunch stating that a Jharkhand government web system inadvertently disclosed the personal information and Aadhaar numbers of 1,66,000 government employees
 pichley saal alderson ne hi telugana sarkaar ke laabh bhugtan portal tspost kii suraksha kamiyon ko ujagar kiya tha
 It included account details and Aadhaar numbers of more than 50 lakh beneficiaries of National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and 40 lakh beneficiaries of social security pension
 indian oil ne alderson ke daavon kaa khandan kiya he
 The company says that only Aadhaar number is stored in its software, which is necessary for transfer of LPG subsidy
 usne ek aadhikarik bayaan main kaha, ''indian oil aadhaar-sambandhi koi anya vivaran nahin leti he
 Therefore disclosure of Aadhaar data is not possible from our side
 '' suraksha visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki alderson ke khulaase main biometric soochnaaon sahit kendriyakrut aadhaar data ke ulanghan kaa sanket nahin he, phir bhi vah yah to ingit karata hi he ki itani badi maatra main vyaktigat data ko sanbhaalane ke liye jo upaay kiye gaye hai ve paryaapt nahin hai
 Cyber security Expert, Subimal Bhattacharjee says, "such information is not very confidential but they are private and the decision to provide them should be with the person to whom they belong
" agenciyon ko sunishchit karnaa chahie ki vyaktigat data kisi bhi durupyog se surakshit rahe
 Critics of Aadhaar have argued that unauthorized use of Aadhaar numbers can lead to fraud, even identity theft
 vaise bhattacharji kehete hai, ''dhokhadhadi ho sakati he par biometrics se samjhauta kiye bina pahchaan kii chori mushkil he
 "more than 90 percent of Indians have an Aadhaar number
 nae yug kii arthvyavastha main itane bade data ke behisaab mulya ko dekhte hue, inden ke data main send se data-suraksha ke liye majboot kanoon kii jarurat par phir se bahes shuru ho sakati he
 Telecom Regulator TRAI Chairman R
 es
 Sharma says that India generates far more data per month than any other country, so it must follow Europe's ideals to tighten its data security
 lekin sharma aadhaar par gopneeyata kii bahes kii niyat par sawaal khadey karte hai
 They believe that all this is due to stiff competition because "many companies are behind the base and they want to create their own identity system
" '' sharma yah bhi sweekaar karte hai ki unke paas is baat ko sabit karne kaa koi saboot nahin he
 What he said is based on 'circumstantial evidence'
 90 fisadi bharatiyon ke paas aadhaar he
 And the value of such vast data in today's economy is unmatched

 Now that only a few days are left for the new Lok Sabha to begin, the Congress has not been able to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition in the House
 vipakshi dalon main sabase zyada saansad congress se hi hai
 Rahul was projected as the future leader of the party in the elections and therefore many leaders believe that he should work as the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 lekin party kaa ek dhada chahta he ki rahul ke paas prashasnic or sansadeey jimmedaariyaan sanbhaalane kaa anubhav nahin rahaa he or aise main yah un par boj ban jayega
 This second section of the Congress is being described as having vested selfish elements of the Gandhi family loyalists
 yah dhada chahta he ki gandhi parivaar se itar koi anya netaa is pad par asin ho
 For this, veteran leaders Kamal Nath, Veerappa Moily and Mallikarjun Kharge are being named
 vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par inamen se kisi ek ko chunane kii salaah di ja rahi he
 But those who support Rahul are saying that his refusal to lead the party at this time will indicate that he is indifferent and his critics will get a chance to condemn him
 congress ke pravaktaa shashi tharur ne kaha ki vah congress ke netaa hai
 For them, Parliament and the party are the platform
 unke kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki rahul gandhi ko in padon par bane rahanaa chahie
 If Rahul continues to be the Leader of the Opposition, then it will be discussed whether the Speaker of the Lok Sabha considers him the Leader of the Opposition or not
 aisa isliye party ke paas loksabhaa main mahaj 44 saansad hi hai jabaki kanoon 54 hone chahie
 This matter is yet to be debated

 Appreciating the initiative taken by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the founder of 'art of Living', to mediate in the Ram temple case, Swamy said it was good for reconciliation, but the matter would only be decided in court
 shri shri kii tarifaswami ne kaha ki shri shri ravishankar ek sammaneey vyakti hai or ve logon se mil rahe hai
 This is a welcome move
 unhone kaha, 'ham ram janmabhumi kshetra main kisi masjid ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 They can build mosques anywhere in the Muslim-majority area
 'agast tak nipat jayega vivadaswami ne kaha ki maamla adaalat ke nirnay ke anusaar tay hoga
 Speaking in a session of the 'jaipur Dialogues Forum', Swamy said that the hearing in the case in the Supreme Court would begin from December 5
 ummid he ki april tak sunwaayee puri ho jaaegi or agast tak maamle kaa nipatra ho jayega
 He expressed confidence that Hindus would prevail in the court and construction of the Ram temple would begin thereafter
 logon ko agali diwali par ayodhya jane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Taking a dig at the Congress Congress, which will remain in Tihar, Swamy said that the Congress is a party without a leader and it will end soon
 congress kaa patan nishchit he
 If it stays alive then it will remain in Tihar Jail only
 unhone kaha ki congress party dwaara kiye gaye bhrashtachar ke baad ab adaalat main sajaa ke rup main parinaam aaenge

 ye baat mere jehan main tab se he jab main kam umr kaa tha or aishwarya kamasin hua karti thi, or aaj aapke saamne ise bayaan kar rahaa hum
 Did not even know what Miss World is, just in our town cities, every rickshaw, tempo, bicycle was caught on two eyes
 beintahaan khubasurat ankhen
 The age in which we are expected to watch cartoons and be silly used to chase these two eyes for our colorful dreams
 najuk se tan main faaulad sa iraadaa, ammaa kii bahuria banegi yahi chhokariya
 When i grew up, one day i saw Aishwarya Rai, the mistress of these eyes, on Doordarshan, appealing to donate her beautiful eyes
 jhepu swabhaav or pitane kaa dar na hota to duniya ke sabase bade laudspikar par munaadi karvaa detaa ki hamako hamaari 'ankhen' mil gai hai usapar koi or aankh na uthaave
 However, time is like the money left at the end of the month, which is not known when spent
 hamaare jawan hone kaa intjaar karne ke bajaae aishwarya sallu ke prem main pad gai
 Hundreds of volcanoes will be torn by our anger if Sabu is not known
 jahaan pyaar kii rimjhim honi thi vahaan bevafaayee kaa hudahud aa gaya
 Well, we saw the biceps of the brother, the biceps and the emerging ribs on the stomach and forgive him
 is gam se ubarne ko dasvin main do baar or 12veen main ek baar lataka

 But when the uplifting works, then there is no scope for copying
 ye baat hamako to tabhi or salmaan ko sneha ulaal kii 'lucky' ke manhusiyat bhare collection se pataa chal gaya
 Aishwarya was the only one who was neither with us nor with Sallu
 jab vivek se aishwarya kaa naam judaa to mujhe vaaki uske vivek par shaq hua
 But these two remained as much as Oberoi Sahab's films do
 idhar vivek ko jabaan ladaate hi filmon ke laale pade udhar ham bhi bharat ke sabase bade scam ke shikaar hue
 If the real book is not found, then Insa gets passed by Xerox

 We also said in the talk don't contact me now
 idhar jald hi desh main bahut baari traasadee hui
 There was a casualty of around 60-70 crore hearts together when the media showed that Aishwarya got married with Bachchan Sahab's handmaiden
 main to sochataa tha bachchan sahab kii company abisiel se zyada bada ghaataa unhen abhishek main invest karke hua he
 But the answer of his son became silent
 to bas itani si thi ek aashiq kii aatmakatha
 Goya Aashiq, we are still there, but what is it that some are sanskari, they do not take care of the destiny of others
 ab is duniya-e-phani se kalti kaa vakt aayaa he to sochaa aatmavyatha, muaafi aatmakatha chipka jaaen

 *** All the excuses that Asaram made to prove himself innocent and to protect himself from the clutches of the law, one by one, are now being exposed
 asaram ne kaha tha ki unhen koi neurological beemaari he, jise jodhpur ke doctoron ne galat qaraar diya he
 Earlier, Asaram was also found fit in the potency test
 somvaar phir hoga asaram kii peshiyon utpeedan cese main fanse asaram kii somvaar ko phir jodhpur kii jila adaalat main peshi hogi
 He was produced in court on Sunday after his arrest late Saturday night
 adaalat ne unhen ek din kii police remand main bheja tha
 Asaram sought permission from the court to remain in the ashram
 lekin court ne use khaarij kar diya tha
 Asaram was arrested after 12 days of hideout on the first night of the lockup and during remand he was placed in the mess of the first battalion of RAC in Jodhpur
 hawalat kii pehali raat main asaram se ghanton tak poochtacha hoti rahi
 During this, Asaram asked for fruit and milk to eat, then he was given two bananas, two sev and a glass of milk

 Asharam, who was caught in the sexual assault case of his Gurukul girl, was questioned for hours by the Jodhpur police

 The police also reached the Madai Ashram where Asaram was charged for the investigation
 jaanch ke liye police puure ghatnakram kaa ri-criation bhi karavaaegi
 Asaram is still young! After getting remand from the court, Asaram was first taken to Sampurnanand Hospital in Jodhpur, where he underwent two potency tests
 khabar he ki donon main hi asaram bilkul feet paae gaye
 After the allegations on himself, Asaram had argued that making such allegations against him at the age of 72 is absolutely false
 asaram ko lekar sangramasaram ko lekar desh ke kai shaharon main hangaamaa machataa rahaa
