 In an informal conversation with reporters at the party headquarters in Delhi, Ramesh made the interesting comment, "in every state, Dal means lotus
" '' yah tippanee bhale hi hasya-vinod main kii gai ho lekin isamen rajyon main prabhavi sthaneey yaa kshetreey dalon (chaahe vah rashtriya party kaa darja rakhti ho) ke sikudte aakaar or janaadhar kaa sanket he
 So is the BJP now moving towards 'regional party Mukt Bharat' with 'congress Mukt Bharat'? Party General Secretary Arun Singh says, "the era is over when any party seeks votes by citing religion, caste and family
" Used to do it
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane kaam ke dam par yah nerrative set kiya he ki vot sirf vahi hasil kar saktaa he jo janakalyaan ke liye din-raat kaam karata ho
 You work among people on the ground
 bhaajapa yah kar rahi he isliye koi bhi rashtriya yaa kshetreey dal jo is hakeekat ko nahin samaj rahaa he, vah apana janaadhar or aakaar khota ja rahaa he
 In fact, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, the BJP had written the script for its target on local parties only in 2014, when the BJP got a majority on its own
 party ke ek anya mahasachiv kehete hai, ''amit shah ne rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad pehla focus uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal, odisha jaise rajyon main party ko majboot karne par rakhaa, jahaan sthaneey dal majboot sthiti main the
 "perhaps behind this, there is a feeling that the party can expand in other states besides the states of West, Central and North India only when the base and size of the regional parties are reduced
" isaki prishthbhumi khaskar bihar or uttar pradesh main 2014 main acchhee-khaasi jeet ne taiyaar kar di thi
 Uttar Pradesh was the biggest front in this
 shah bhaajapa adhyaksh banane se pehle 2014 main uttar pradesh main party ke prabharee mahasachiv the or us dauraan 403 main se 401 vidhansabhai chunaav kshetron main pravaas kar chuke the
 So during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when Shah was claiming that the BJP in Uttar Pradesh would win more than 73 seats in 2014 (with Apna Dal), it was not just to boost the morale of party workers
 ve party padaadhikariyon ko bataaya karte the ki ve yah daawa isliye kar rahe hai kyonki ''main uttar pradesh ko samaj gaya hum
 There is no one among the leaders of other parties (apart from Mulayam Singh) who understands the entire state
 ''shah kii ginati main sirf uttar pradesh hi nahin tha
 He completely dumped his general secretaries in states where local parties have been in a strong position
 unhone mahasachiv arun singh ko odisha, kailash vijayawargeey ko pashchim bengal, anil jain ko haryana or jharkhand, bhupendra yadav ko bihar or saroj pandey ko maharashtra main bina brake ke tainaat rakhaa
 Shah regularly used to get the details of every activity done in the state from these general secretaries and he also camped in these states himself when needed
 bhaajapa media vibhaag ke pramukh or rajyasabha saansad anil baluni kehete hai, ''bataur party bhaajapa har rajya main khud ko majboot kar rahi he
 Everyone has the right to expand his party
 isamen ab bhaajapa kii kya galati he ki zyaadaatar rajyon main congress lagbhag samaapt ho chuki he
 If there is no Congress, then the supporters of other parties in those states are turning to the BJP about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policy of development
 ''kya ranneeti apnaaiuttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party or pashchimi uttar pradesh main rashtriya lokdal apane jatigat sameekaran ke dam par majboot sthiti main rahe hai
 During the election, the nationally active BJP or Congress used to compete as the third and fourth party
 lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav hone se pehle bhaajapa ne sapa or basapa donon ke vot bank main send lagane kii chaak-chauband yojana bana lee
 The BJP weakened both these parties by making a dent in the bsp's non-jatav and sp's non-yadav vote bank
 upar se modi lahar ne in donon dalon ko rajya main lagbhag puri tarah se kinare laga diya
 Then in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP was successful in making more dent in the vote bank of these two parties
 saath hi ujjwala jaisi lokapriy yojana ke dam par bhaajapa ne har ghar main khud ko charchaa kaa mudda bana diya
 Seeing the exaggeration of the situation and the aggression of BJP, SP-BSP-RLD formed an alliance but this experiment did not succeed as BJP was able to convey the message that this election is being held to elect the Prime Minister, SP and BSP leader PM They are not in the race to become
 isi tarah bihar main 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jad(you), rajd or congress saath mil kar lade or bhaajapa ko rokane main safal rahe
 BJP leaders are of the view that Nitish Kumar's party may not have its own vote bank in Bihar but Nitish Kumar is a brand there and he is known for the development work done in the state
 aise main nitish kumaar ke saath bhaajapa ne barabari ke saath chunaav ladaa or jeet hasil kii
 The RJD went marginalized without winning a seat here
 lekin nitish ke baad jad(you) kaa brands ambesder koun he? bihar bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''yahaan endie khud hi apana netaa chun legaa
 "actually JD (U) in Bihar or Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are not decisive on their own
 ye dal tabhi prabhavi pradarshan karte hai, jab bhaajapa ke saath hote hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish's party was able to win only two seats after fighting off from the BJP
 isi tarah maharashtra main shivasena 2014 kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhaajapa se alag hokar ladi or bhaajapa yahaan sabase badi party ban gai
 So are there any Shiv Sena and JD (U) targets of BJP too? a JD (U) leader says, "it's not just about winning elections
" ye donon dal bhaajapa ke haathon apana kader kho rahe hai
 There is a lot of ideological similarity between the cadre of Shiv Sena and BJP
 aise main shivasena kamjor hogi to kader khud-ba-khud bhaajapa ke paas chalaa jayega
 The same with JD (U)
 bhaajapa or jad(you) donon hi bihar main vikaas ke naam par raajnneeti kar rahe hai isliye jad(you) or bhaajapa kabhi alag hui to jad(you) kaa kader bhaajapa kii taraf jane kii sambhaavna adhik he kyonki rajya main party kaa sanghathan jad(you) ke sanghathan se kahin majboot sthiti main he
 "but is it easy for the BJP to easily defeat regional parties in states like West Bengal and Odisha?" Neither the bjp's organization is strong in these states, nor is it suitable for the Trinamool or BJD cadre
 rajnatik tikaakar rajat raay kehete hai, ''bhaajapa bahut hi soch-samaj kar kshetreey dalon ko kamjor karne kii niti par chal rahi he
 In the last three-four years, BJP has managed to bring large and effective Trinamool leaders to its fold in dozens of numbers in West Bengal
 odisha main bhi bhale kam lekin vahaan bhi party vahi kar rahi he
 The BJP took along 4 Rajya Sabha mps in Andhra Pradesh
 jahaan bhaajapa kaa sanghathan kamjor he vahaan duusari partiyon ke majboot logon ko apane paale main karke bhaajapa khud ko majboot bana rahi he
 The Lok Sabha election 2019 results are its witness
 '' raay kehete hai, mamata jaisi netaa se muqabla karne ke liye bhaajapa ko jis kader kii jarurat he, use bhi vah bane-banaae mil gaya
 The cadre of leftist parties went to the BJP to defeat Mamata in the recent elections
 aage kii sochabhaajapa agle paanch saal tak har rajya main sabase pramukh dal banane kii yojana lekar chal rahi he
 Especially in states where local parties dominate
 amit shah kaa 50 fisadi vot paane kaa lakshya isi yojana ke mutabik he
 How will this goal be achieved? National spokesperson of BJP
 ve
 L
 narsingh raav kehete hai, ''jin netaaon ke dam par kshetreey dal bane the, ve ab umradraj ho gaye hai yaa phir sakriy nahin hai
 These leaders have none other than leaders like Lalu Yadav Mulayam Singh, Sharad Pawar, Chandrababu Naidu, Mayawati, KCR, HD Deve Gowda, Shibu Soren
 inke jo uttaradhikari hai yaa jinke banane kii sambhaavna he, use bani banaai party apane-aap mil gai lekin uttaradhikari main vah spark nahin dikhataa jo in dalon ke sansthaapakon main tha
 "but can a national party (BJP) become an alternative to a local party in the states?" The regional parties' dictation is based on local needs and issues, so its form does not match that of the national party
 masalan, andhra pradesh kii bhaajapa ikai rajya ke liye vishesh darje kii maang kar sakati he lekin kendriya bhaajapa ke liye yah karnaa kathin hoga
 The same is the case with Bihar
 bihar bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh devesh kumaar kehete hai, ''bhaajapa main yah khaasiyat he ki vah rajya or centre donon ke muddon ko ek samaan dhang se sambhalati he
 In fact, the BJP has been successful in taking it logically to the people that the party will not allow the interests of any state to be ignored on legitimate and urgent issues
 ''asal main andhra pradesh main jab bhaajapa tidipi kii sahyogi thi to vah vishesh rajya kaa darja maangati thi
 But Devesh Kumar said, "BJP has financially helped the state more than it does even after attaining special state status
 '' isliye unka tark he ki bhaajapa un rajyon main bhi utani hi lokapriy sarkaar chalaa rahi he jahaan pehle kisi sthaneey dal kaa kabja mana jaataa tha
 However, in Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tripura and now Bengal, the BJP has achieved great success
 agle vidhansabha chunaav main muqabla bhaajapa or trinmul main hi hona tay he
 In states where the regional parties are currently in power or opposition, the BJP is making a place as a new option in the coming days
 kshetreey dalon ke liye ve din lad gaye jab teesri party kaa vikalp hi nahin tha
 The BJP has filled this empty space
 sthaneey dal nahin chete to bhaajapa 'congress mukt bharat' se ab 'kshetreey dal mukt bharat' kii ore bad chalegi
 Regional parties were formed on the basis of the stalwart leaders, they have now aged and are no longer active

 After 12 hours of peace, the neighboring country opened fire once again in Hamirpur in Mendhar, Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya sena ne bhi jabaavi karrwai kii
 What is the reason behind this activation of Pakistani soldiers? Is Pakistan working with any specific strategy after the coming of Modi government? The reason we tell you: 1
 pakistani sena bhartiya sainikon kaa man bhaanpane ke liye firing kar rahi he
 Pakistan wants to know whether there is a change in India's strategy after the formation of the new government or whether the soldiers have been given any specific guidelines
 2
 Pakistan wants to give the terrorists an opportunity to infiltrate by firing on the loc and the international border before winter begins
 bataaya jaataa he ki seemaa ke us paar kareeb 300 aatanki bharat main ghusane kii firaaq main hai

 2002 ke gujarat dangon main vivaadaaspad bhoomika kii vajah se kuch arsa pehle tak europea sangh main modi kaa pravesh varjit tha

 According to him, "as if the CEO of the company is doing a good job
" agar company acha pradarshan karti he to swaabhaavik rup se siio ko phayda hota he, isi tarah agar gujarat kii sthiti majboot hoti he to modi kaa naam bhi chamakta he

 supreme court ne babari vidhwans maamle main mangalvaar ko bijepi ke varisht netaaon- laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ko notice jari kiya
 The court has given them this notice on a petition challenging the Allahabad High Court's verdict in which the two leaders were acquitted of criminal conspiracy charges in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case
 jaaniye kya he puraa maamla
 
 
 - Babri Masjid demolished on 6 December 1992 - maamle main do FIR darj - Lakhs of unknown car servants nominated in first FIR - duusari FIR main laalkrishna adwani samet kai log namjad According to the FIR, the mosque was demolished due to Advani's inflammatory speech - raay bareli kii court main chale maamle - Both cases were later handed over to the assembled CBI
 - sibiai ne 5 oktober 1993 ko chargeshit daakhil kii - On 12 February 2001, both cases were separated due to technical flaws - 4 may 2001 ko seshan court ne adwani or anya ke kilaaf aapraadhik saazish ke aarope hataae - Allahabad High Court upheld Sessions court order on 20 May 2010 - 20 may 2010 ko CBI kii punarvichaar yachika kaarij - CBI appeals to Supreme Court after nine months delay uttar pradesh ke chunavi mahasamar main banaras sabhi partiyon ke liye khaas ban gaya he
 There is such a churn over the seat sharing that if it wins the seats here, it is like winning Uttar Pradesh
 aisa isliye he kyonki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 Therefore, the defeat and victory here can have a profound effect on the politics of the party on the plank of the country, because on the one hand, by stopping the bjp's victory chariot in the seats of Banaras, the opposition will start claiming that the PM cannot save his stronghold in the country
 What will win 
 
 vahiin bijepi ke liye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa jawaab dena baari padegaa
 Sources said that the decision to claim the eight seats in Benaras will be under the supervision of the PM
 varanasi sansadeey kshetra par agar najar daalen to yahaan kii aath vidhansabha siton main se teen siton shahar uttari, shahar dakshini or kaint seat par bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 The Rohaniya and Sevapuri assembly seats are occupied by Samajwadi
 pindra seat par congress vijayi hui thi to ajgara or shivpur seat basapa ke paas he
 In this, BSP MLA Udayalal Morya from Shivpur recently joined BJP, so now BJP can be considered to have four seats
 bhaajapa in chaaron siton par to apana kabja chaahati hi he saath hi vah baaki bachi chaar siton par bhi apana paracham laharaana chaahati he
 However, due to several elections, the BJP has never been able to spread its footing beyond the three seats in the city
 iske baavjood vah is chunaav par sabhi siton ko jeetna chaahati he
 bjp's hopes are also because in the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi took a good lead on all the assembly seats
 bijepi unheen voton ko sahejkar rakhane kii firaaq main he
 Due to this there is a serious churn in the selection of candidates
 tippaniyan This churn in the equation has become necessary in lieu of the sp-congress alliance because the Congress was second in the Cantt and Dakshina Vidhan Sabha seats apart from its won seat in Pindra
 uske pratyaashee ne 45 hajaar vot paae the, lihaaja sapa se gathbandhan ke baad in siton par congress bahut majboot najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, bjp's victory in the seat of Benares has become a question of nose
 bhaajapa ne varanasi kii aath siton main se paanch siton par apane pratyaashee ghoshit kar die hai
 It has changed the ticket of its sitting mlas from its traditional seat city Dakshin and Cantt
 dakshini main jahaan sanghathan ke ek kaaryakarta ko tikat diya to vahiin kaint main vartmaan vidhayak ke bete ko tikat diya gaya
 The current MLA got the ticket on the northern assembly seat
 jabaki ek seat bhaasapa ke khate main gai
 The rest of the seat can also go to the Apna Dal and the Bhaspa alliance
 yahaan par unki apni birdari ke log zyada hai
 Overall, this means that the caravan was carried forward by saving every single vote that the BJP saved in order to win Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections
 is muhim main se kuch aise netaa bhi the jo duusari party se aae the
 Many tickets were also wanted in them
 unhen tikat nahin mila
 So how to save such people is a big challenge
 sutara bataate the ki banaras kii aathon siton par daavedaari kaa nirnay piem kii dekharekh main hoga
 If we look at the Varanasi parliamentary constituency, BJP is occupied by three seats out of the eight assembly seats in the city, northern, city southern and cant seats
 rohaniya or sewapuri vidhansabha seat par samaajawaadee kaa kabja he
 The Congress won the Pindra seat, while the Ajgara and Shivpur seats are with the BSP
 isamen shivpur se bispi ke vidhayak udailaal morya haal hi main bijepi main shaamil ho gaye lihaaja ab bijepi ke paas chaar siten maani ja sakati hai
 The BJP not only wants to capture these four seats, but also wants to win the remaining four seats
 haalanki kai chunaavon se bhaajapa shahar kii teen siton ke alaava kabhi bhi apana paanv nahin failaa pai he
 Despite this, she wants to win all seats on this election
 bhaajapa kii ummiden isliye bhi hai kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ne sabhi vidhansabha siton par acchhee badhat lee thi
 BJP is trying to save the same votes
 is kaaran pratyaashiyon ke chayan main gambhir manthan ho rahaa he
 The comments sapa-congress ke gathbandhan ke badale sameekaran main yah manthan isliye bhi jaruri ho gaya he kyonki congress pindra kii apni jiti seat ke alaava kaint or dakshini vidhansabha seat par duusare number par thi
 His candidate got 45 thousand votes, so after the alliance with SP, Congress is looking very strong in these seats
 aise main banaras kii seat par bhaajapa kii jeet naak kaa sawaal ban gai he
 The BJP has declared its candidates for five of the eight seats in Varanasi
 usne apni paramparaagat seat shahar dakshini or kaint se apane sitting vidhayakon kaa tikat badal diya he
 In southern, where a worker of the organization was given a ticket, the current mla's son was given the ticket in Cantt
 uttari vidhansabha seat par vartmaan vidhayak ko hi tikat mila
 While one seat went to Bhaspa's account
 baaki kii seat bhi apana dal or bhaasapa gathbandhan ko ja sakati he
 There are more people from his own community here
 kul mila kar kehane kaa matlab yah ki loksabhaa ke chunaav main narendra modi ko jitaane ke liye bhaajapa ne jin ek-ek vot ko sahejkar kaaravaan ko aage badhaayaa tha
 In this campaign, there were some leaders who came from other party

 This churn in the equation has become necessary in lieu of the sp-congress alliance because the Congress was second in the Cantt and Dakshina Vidhan Sabha seats apart from its won seat in Pindra

 jabaki ek seat bhaasapa ke khate main gai
 The rest of the seat can also go to the Apna Dal and the Bhaspa alliance
 yahaan par unki apni birdari ke log zyada hai
 Overall, this means that the caravan was carried forward by saving every single vote that the BJP saved in order to win Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections
 is muhim main se kuch aise netaa bhi the jo duusari party se aae the
 Many tickets were also wanted in them
 unhen tikat nahin mila

 Cricket became the carrier of mutual harmony in society from the difficult days of social and caste discrimination
 raajnneetik, saamaajik or rashtriyata ke mudde cricket ke aage dam todate gaye
 Historian Ramachandra Guhane has done a brilliant analysis of every aspect of Indian cricket in his book 'foreign Khel Apne Maidan: The Social History of Indian Cricket'
 isi kitaab se kuch chuninda ansh jo cricket ke bhoot ko ek jatke main beparda kar dete hai
 Where the Queen's flag was hoisted, cricket was played
 The first description of cricket in India is found in 1721 when British sailors played a match at the port of Cambay
 itihaaskaar likhte hai, hamaare sainikon ko horse gords ke aadesh par unke rihaayshi ilaakon ke paas hi cricket ke maidan uplabdh karaae gaye or maharani ke jahaaj main uplabdh gend or balle samudr ke tilchatton or kinare par kekadon or kachhuon ko hairaan kar dene ko maujuud the
 In this way, cricket was played wherever the Queen's servants hoisted the victory flag and the weather was favorable
 cricket kam manoranjanengland ke baahar pehla cricket club kalakatta cricket club 1792 main british shashan kaal ke dauraan bana
 The club played their first match on the huge ground that still surrounds Fort William and where the 'human exercise of cricket continued till evening eating and dancing where the players' tried their other way
 ’bhartiya jameen par pehla shatakbaarah saal baad yani 1804 main kalakatta cricket club ne old antonius or east india company ke kuch khilaadiyon ke bich ek mahaan cricket match pryojit kiya
 Robert Vansittart scored a century in this match, which was the first century of any player on Indian soil
 bharat main sattebaaji kaa pehla daanvold antonius or east india company ke bich khelaa gaya muqabla bharat main lagaae gaye pehle satte ke liye bhi yaadgaar he
 The Old Antonians won the match by an innings, defying all estimates
 unke khilaaf bhav 2-1 kaa tha
 Prior to Hindu, Muslim, English and Parsi freedom, Indian cricket was divided on the basis of religion, but the feeling of caste discrimination also existed deep
 firangiyon ke alaava desh main mukhyatah hindu, musalmaan or parsiyon kii timen thi, jo aapas main ek duusare ko chunauti dete the
 The Pavalankar brothers dominated the Pavalankar brothers for a long time
 powelankar bandhuon ko mishrit cricket team main jagah ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa
 They had to eat tea and bread in the dough and cups used by their companions
 pehla hindu cricketerramchandra vishnu naavlekar cricket khilne vaale pehle hindu the or unhone is kshetra main san 1861 main pravesh kiya
 Expecting a victory Pavlankar Balu of the Chamar caste in the team of Balindus was expected to win
 khel ke maidan par ucch jati ke khilaadi usee gend ko choote the jisko baaluu choote the, lekin maidan ke baahar ucch jati ke khilaadi chuaachhut ke dharmik rivaajon kaa paalan karte the
 Cricket used to be sacred during the tea time
 baaluu mitti ke bartan main chaay pite or duusare khilaadi chini mitti ke safed pyaale main
 If Baloo wanted to wash his hands, the untouchable servant of the club would take a kettle to one corner of the ground and pour water
 baaluu bhojan bhi alag thali main alag teble par karte the
 To be the hero of the servant, Pavlankar Baloo was a left-arm medium-speed spin bowler
 baaluu ne ek naukar ke taur par khelnaa shuru kiya
 Whose job was to make the British practice on the net
 iske badale unhen kuch aane mil jate the
 Along with bowling, he also used to bat well
 us samay test cricket hi khelaa jaataa tha
 In such a situation, Balu would get wickets in the form of bunches
 mohandas karamchand gandhih ek jabardast cricketerrajkot alfred hai skool main mahatma gandhi ke sahpaathee ratilaal ghelabhai mehta ke mutabik gandhi ek jabardast cricketer the
 He was good at both batting and bowling and had a wonderful understanding of the uncertainties of the game
 mehta ne rajkot shahar or rajkot kaint ke bich khele gaye ek match kaa kissa sunaaya jo unhone ek vidhyaarthee ke rup main dekha tha
 Apparently at the decisive moment of the match, perhaps by foreshadowing, Gandhi stated that that particular player would be out and it turned out to be awesome
 vah ballebaaj sachmuch out ho gaya
 10 years after Gandhi's death, Mehta narrated the incident to a Gujarati newspaper
 mehta ke mutabik gandhi ko skool main shaareerik abhyaas se chidh thi
 Gandhi has also written about this in his autobiography
 cricketron ko toast paroste jinna1924 main musalamaanon ne hindu team ko haraakar pehali baar championships jiti
 After the final, the Muslim Students Association invited its victorious cricketers to dinner
 barkatallah khan ke sitar vaadan ke baad khaanaa or bhaashan hua
 The man who was asking toast to the cricketers was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the best Muslim citizen of Bombay
 jo us samay hindu musalmaan ekta ke doot the
 Later on, Jinnah became a separate advocate for Muslims
 chunaav maidan main utarane vaala pehla cricketerpavalankar baaluu pehle aise cricketer hai jo cricket se sanyas ke baad chunavi raajnneeti main utraa
 On the ticket of the Hindu Mahasabha, Balu went to the polls
 ye unki lokapriyata ko darshata he
 The Hindu Mahasabha gave Balu a ticket despite caste discrimination in the society
 or haa, yah imran khan or guyana ke roy fradricks se bahut pehle hua
 And the most horrific stories of discrimination in cricket came from South Africa
 1963 main nataal open ke vijeta bhartiya mul ke dakshin africa golf khilaadi sevasunakar sevegolum ko puraskaar samaaroh main nahin bulaayaa gaya
 Actually the rain started before the award ceremony started
 isliye kaarykram kaa aayojan club ke bheetar sarka diya gaya
 Speeches were made and prizes were distributed to the winning white-skinned golfers
 un dinon niyamon ke anusaar kisi bhi kute or ashwet vyakti kaa imaarat main pravesh pratibandhit tha
 Despite being the winner, Sevagolum kept getting wet with the dogs in the rain outside and waited that the peon of the club would give him his medal and check
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle rajdhani dilli main aam aadmi party or congress ke bich gathbandhan kii ummiden ab khatm hoti ja rahi hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that the Congress has refused to ally with his party
 bataa den ki congress pehle hi inkaar kar chuki thi, lekin aaj is par unka aadhikarik rukh saamne aa saktaa he
 However, now before that, Kejriwal's statement has come out
 dilli main airport par reportron se baat karte hue kaha ki unhone haal hi main rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi, jisamen congress netaa ne aam aadmi party se gathbandhan karne se inkaar kiya tha
 Arvind Kejriwal also made a statement about Delhi Congress state president Sheila Dixit
 kejariwal bole ki hamane gathbandhan ko lekar rahul gandhi se baat kii he, shila dikshit mahatvapurn netaa nahin hai
 Significantly, efforts are being made by the Aam Aadmi Party to tie up with the Congress in Delhi continuously, but the Congress has been denying it
 pehle shila dikshit or rahul gandhi ne safataur par gathbandhan se inkaar kiya tha, tab arvind kejariwal kaa bayaan tha ki congress ne lagbhag gathbandhan se manaa kar diya he
 It is worth noting that it has been seen in many servants that have come so far that if there is an aap-congress alliance on seven seats in Delhi, then the BJP can suffer a lot of damage
 vahiin agar gathbandhan nahin hota he to bijepi ko hi saaton siton par phayda ho saktaa he
 Actually, there are two factions in the Congress regarding the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 shila dikshit lagaataar aam aadmi party se gathbandhan ko manaa karti rahi hai, to vahiin prabharee pisi chaako gathbandhan ke paksh kii baat karte rahe hai

 samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv amar singh ne kaha ki congress se hamaari party ko aaj tak kabhi bhi saath nahin mila
 Amar Singh said that Congress has always insulted the Samajwadi Party
 sapa par congress ne kabhi vishwaas nahin kiya
 Along with this, Amar Singh has also made serious allegations against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati
 unhone bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii manyata radd karne kii bhi maang kii
 Amar Singh said that for this he has also filed a petition in the Election Commission
 upie kii sarkaar ke sitare jab gardish main thi to samaajawaadee party ne uski naiya paar lagaai thi
 But the Samajwadi Party received nothing but humiliation and mistrust from the Congress
 ye aarope lagaaya he party ke mahasachiv amar singh ne
 Amar Singh had said that if there was any difficulty in fighting Lucknow on the ticket of Sanjay Dutt's Samajwadi Party, Manyata would be fielded instead of Sanjay
 lekin jis congress ke saath siton ke liye talmail ho rahaa he, uske mahasachiv diggi raja ko to pataa bhi nahin he ki ye manyata koun he
 The Samajwadi Party may have recognized Sanjay Dutt's wife Manyata's election career
 lekin siyaasi halake main is baat ko lekar mili juli-pratikriya dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Rajabbar, who was once a socialist and now held the hand of the Congress, spoke in a very straight line about recognition
 haalanki ye dilachasp he ki sitaron ke samaajwaad se parhez karne vaale rajbabbar ne manyata ke siyaasi karier ko samaajawaadee party kaa vyaktigat faisla bataaya he
 Some similar thoughts are also with the BJP
 sitaron kii siyasat karne main bijepi sabase aage he
 Perhaps this is the reason that when Samajwadi Party talked about contesting Manyata, BJP declared it as its own decision
 samaajawaadee party ke is faisle se sabase zyada tilamilaahat congress main he
 The Congress may have joined hands with the Samajwadi Party to save the government during the notkand, but when it came to recognizing the politics of recognition, the Congress General Secretary refused to recognize them
 sanjay dutt kii patni manyata siyasat ke morche par kitna rang jamaa paaegi ye to aane vaale vakt main hi saaf ho paaegaa lekin ye abhi ye saaf ho chukaa he ki manyata ke chunaav ladane kii khabar se siyasat ke or rang dekhne ko milenge

 Virat Kohli has the diamonds of childhood, Sachin Tendulkar is the best batsman like Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, i used to think that i won the match- Kohli: Indian team captain Virat Kohli is always compared to Sachin Tendulkar, called the God of Cricket
 iskaa kaaran kohli kii behtareen ballebaaji he
 However Virat Kohli has always kept distance from this comparison
 kohli ne kaha he ki sachin unke bachapan ke hero hai
 Virat Kohli recently told that he has never denied that he always wanted to be like Sachin
 kohli ne ek web sho 'in depth vid graham bensinger' main kaha ki vah jo karte the, wo pyor skills hoti thim
 The way he batted was different from everyone else and that impressed me

 What will happen with increasing MSMS? Growing is every year, let us know when it comes in hand, "this pejorative comment of farmer Brijmohan of Nalanda district of Bihar tells the reality of government announcements coming to the ground
 ''brijmohan kinarazgijaij he kyonki unhen pichley saal apni dhan kii upaj ko nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) se prati quintal 400 rupye kam par bechni padi
 Like Brijmohan, the yield of more than half of the farmers of the country does not even get the minimum support price
 sarkari kharid kii bhrasht niti or anaaj rakhane ke liye godaamon kii kami is raah main sabase bade rode hai
 Now the government has given MSP of Kharif crops, cost 1 to A2 + FL formula
 5 guna badhaakar kisaanon ko filgud massej dene kii koshish kii he
 But how much will it benefit in the next general elections, this year will only reflect the Diwali of farmers like Brijmohan
 darasal, aktubar-november hi vah samay hoga jab nai emspi par kharif fasalon kii kharid shuru hogi
 In order to reduce the discontent spreading between the new liquor village and farmers in the old bottle, the government made 1 from the A2+ FL formula
 5 guna emspi dene kii ghoshnaa kii (krishi laagat or aay aankane ke mote taur par teen formule hai, dekhen box)
 However, the farmers' organizations are not happy with the cost formula of the government
 kisaan netaa ve
 M
 singh kehete hai, "sarkaar ne kisaanon se si2 laagat par 1
 Had said to give 5 times MSP
 pradhanmantri ne bhi apane bhaashanon main bhi swaminathan cameti kii siforeeshon kaa hawala dete hue iskaa zikr kiya he
 But the government has kept its promise
 e2+effel laagat par emspi dena kuch nayaa nahin he
 The previous government has also done this work
 yah puraani bottle main nai sharaab kii tarah he
 "three Formulas of Costs Agricultural Costs and Price Commission accepts three methods of fixing production costs - A2 costs include all payments made by the farmer
 isamen beej, khaad, kitnashak, mazdooron kii mazdooree, sinchai, eendhan aadi kaa kharch joda jaataa he
 In A2 + FL, the cost of farming along with the cost of A2 is also added to the hard work done by family members
 - si2 main samgr laagat ke saath-saath swaamitv vaali bhoomi par anumaanit kiraaya or puunji par diya jane vaala byaaj bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he
 The biggest challenge is that farmers' produce is sold at or above the minimum support price, which is dependent on government procurement
 sarkari kharid kaa bhrasht tantra or buniyadi dhaanche kii kami is raah main sabase bada roda he
 Former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, Tzamul Haque, says, "only 30 per cent of farmers in the country get the minimum support price for their crops
 sarkari kharid niti main badlaav kii jarurat he
 The economic health of the states is not suitable for large government procurement
 '' haq maanate hai ki sarkaar ko har rajya main saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies) ke madhyam se keval chaaval or gehun hi nahin baantnaa chahie
 It also incurs transportation costs and the food grains distributed in the PDS are not suited to the needs of the people there
 isse behatar hoga ki sarkaar anya fasalon kii bhi sarkari kharid kare or har rajya main peedies ke madhyam se jarurat ke mutabik anaaj baante
 For example, in the southern states it would be better for the government to distribute ragi than wheat
 emspi badhaakar kisaanon ko saadhane kaa tarika nayaa nahin he
 Earlier governments too have adopted this method in the election years
 modi sarkaar kisaanon par lagaaya gaya yah daanv chuknaa nahin chaahati
 This is the reason that work is also on to fix the procurement policy
 madhya pradesh kii bhavantar yojana kii tarj par sarkaar koi pahal kar sakati he, jiske tahat puure desh main panjikrut treders sarkaar kii ore se kisaanon kii upaj ko kharidenge
 After this, the difference between market price and MSP will be compensated by the government
 isle alaava bhartiya khaadya nigam (epasiai) ke bhare godaamon ko agali fasal bazaar main aane se pehle khaali karne kii chunauti hogi
 As of June 2018, 93 percent of fci's total warehouses are full
 abhi sarkaar rajyon kii agenciyon ke madhyam se keval unheen rajyon main sarkari kharid karti he jahaan utpaadan rajya kii jarurat se zyada hota he
 msp's double trap increase in MSP to provide relief to farmers actually puts the government in a double dilemma
 emspi main vruddhi kaa phayda kisaanon tak pahunche na pahunche lekin bazaar main mahangaai jarur bad jaati he
 The increase in MSP of Kharif crops directly means the rise in commodity prices like rice, pulses, cotton and soybeans
 aise utpaadon ke daam bhi bad jate hai jinka kaccha maal yahi camodity hoti hai
 Radhika Pandey, consultant and economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy says, "the increase in MSP will provide some relief to the farmers but will also have an impact on inflation
 badi hui emspi ke kaaran khudara mahangaai main 40 se 50 basis point kii badhotaree dekhi ja sakati he
 "in the recent monetary policy review, the Reserve Bank of India has also raised fears of an increase in the MSP
 mahangaai badaae kii yahi ashanka saste karj ke daravaaje or majbootee se band kar degi
 The rise in inflation and the hope of cheap loans are a blow to the middle class
 nishchit taur par sarkaar ke liye is tabake ko khush rakhana bhi utana hi jaruri he
 Confusion and the impact of increase in MSP is not only limited to inflation, but it will also be a burden on the public exchequer
 laagat se 50 fisadi zyada emspi dene kaa vaada sarkaar ke khajaane par 33,500 karod rupye kaa atirikt bhaar daalega
 Radhika Pandey states, “0 on government fiscal deficit
 1 fisadi tak kaa asar daal saktaa he
 However, the improvement in GST collections may reduce its impact on the fiscal deficit
 ''aagaamee chunaavon main jeet kii raah gaanv se hi hokar gujaregi
 In such a situation, the government will try its best to get the full benefit of the increased MSP of Kharif crops
 sarkaar kii ummid to yahi he ki mehnat kaa parinaam diwali par gaanv main jalane vaale diyon kii roshni main dikhne lagenge or kisaanon kaa gussa ghat jayega
 But much will depend on whether the government is able to reach the MSP to the farmers
 kis kaam kii nai emspi?desh ke har naagarik ko khaadya suraksha or gramin ilaakon main rojgaar dene ke liye krishi kshetra behad ahm he
 But unfortunately since independence, till now we are exploiting natural resources and farmers in the name of welfare of consumers
 yah dukhad he ki samaajawaadee or loktantric kalyankari rajya kii chuni hui sarkaar kisaanon ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) tay karne main uchit laagat (si2) ko aadhaar maanane kii icchhuk nahin he
 According to the government's claim, farmers are getting more than 50 percent return on their produce

 Is this enough to support the farming families? It is clear that the MSP decided by the government will not change the standard of living of the farmers
 gramin ilaakon kii garibi or sankat ko in emspi se dur nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to me, the time has come to abolish the MSP and ensure farmers' compensation with a new idea
 mukt bazaar arthvyavastha or vaishvik bazaar main emspi prabhavi tarika nahin he
 When commodity markets around the world are going down, we are increasing MSP
 yah bhartiya arthvyavastha or krishi aadhaarit udyogon kii pratispardhaatmakataa ko khatm kar degaa
 Compared to the new MSP, the prices of agricultural products are much lower in the international market
 masalan, makke kii nai emspi 1,700 ru
 Per quintal, while the price in the international market is Rs 1,227
 prati quintal he
 Similarly, the new MSP of sunflower seed is Rs 5,388
 prati quintal he jabaki antarrashtriya bazaar main bhav 2,900 ru
 Per quintal
 aise main niryaat ke kshetra main bhartiya krishi utpaada pratispardhaa main khadey nahin rah paaenge
 This will also affect the domestic market
 camodity kii keemat ghatane par sarkaar kisaanon kii madad karne ke liye bhavantar jaisi skiimon ke jariye emspi or bazaar bhav ke antar kii bharpai karti he
 In order to extend the benefit of MSP to the farmers, there is a need to review all those laws which increase the cost of bringing the produce of the farmers to the market
 sabhi kanoon 10 saal se zyada puraane hai
 The Central Government will again have to show political will to reform the agriculture sector like GST
 krishi kshetra main sudhaar hi ko-operative fedralism kaa sabase bada imtihaan hoga
 Can political leadership show courage to overcome this hurdle to help the farmers? If not, the new MSP will be just a piece of paper, which will not benefit the farmers financially

 On 21 April 2013, Delhi defeated Mumbai Indians by nine wickets and after that they had to wait two years and nine defeats at home to win

 The comments is bich team ne kai captain badale, kai khilaadi badale or karodon rupee pani kii tarah bahaae, lekin maidan par uskaa pradarshan nahin sudhara

 Political analysts say that while it is convenient to campaign with a chopper, it has become a status symbol along with fashion

 In a setback to former Andhra Pradesh Governor Narayan Dutt Tiwari, the Delhi High Court today rejected his plea and decided to hear the plea of the man who described himself as Tiwari's son

 The court set aside the single bench verdict in which the paternity suit filed by law graduate Rohit Shekhar was dismissed on the ground that it was not admissible
 peeth ne maamle se jude sabhi pakshon ko nirdesh diya ki ve saat april ko ekal nyaayadhish ke samaksh pesh hon jab maamle main gun dosha ke aadhaar par sunwaayee hogi
 Tiwari was forced to step down as Andhra Pradesh Governor when he was allegedly shown in an objectionable position with three women in a sting operation
 adaalat ne 11 march ko vaad main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Tiwari vehemently opposed the hearing on Shekhar's plea
 shekhar ne adaalat se tiwari ko uskaa jaivik pita ghoshit karne kaa nirdesh dene kaa aagrah kiya tha
 He challenged the single bench's decision to dismiss his petition in the bench
 nyaayamurti esen dhingra ne gat teen navambar ko faisla diya tha ki shekhar kii yachika sweekaar yogya nahin
 The court said that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case as the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh was in Hyderabad and a suit could be filed against him only in that city
 shekhar ne apane vaad main daawa kiya tha ki vah apni maa ujjwala sharma or tiwari ke bich sambandhon ke parinamswaroop paidaa hua
 In November 2008, the court directed Tiwari to file an answer in the case
 jawaab main tiwari ne sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kar diya tha or kaha tha ki vaad unhen badnaam karne ke liye daayar kiya gaya he

 Senior Congress leader p Chidambaram on Sunday criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his remarks about caste and calling himself a chaiwala and asked if the Prime Minister considers people "stupid" to remember nothing

 When Nitish Kumar was asked in the talks, why don't you take the Prime Minister's blame for this in the civil aviation minister? So he opened Google and replied that to take the name of 'pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju', he has to look twice at Google, if he accuses him then how he forgets the name before the charge is completed

 Ajit remembers all the old villains
 khalanaayak jo kaaiyaan rahe
 Be rich balavaan rahe
 Despite this, he could never win over the hero
 kyonki har baar unhone kuch chuni hui galtiyaan doharaayin
 Mostly these mistakes were repeated villains of the eighties and nineties
 kuch galtiyaan ab bhi doharaai ja rahi hai
 Know what were the Vogalites who kept repeating almost every villain
 bachche ko kyon chhod diya :ek eemaandaar majdoor union leader, pulisavaale yaa kisaan or uski bivi ko maarane ke baavjood villen har baar chote bachche ko maarna bhul jaataa he or vahi baccha bada hokar usase badla letaa he
 The question is, when the villain is ruthless, then why is there a laziness in killing the child? Where did the brother go: The villain killed the hero's father
 maa ko beton se juda kiya or unamem se ek ko apane saath letaa gaya? ye villen hai yaa babisitor? jab villen dushman ke bachche main budhaape kaa sahaara khojane lagata he to vinaash to tay he
 In the end, Hero Tattoo recognizes his brother by the talisman and the poor villain gets a double-sided grinder

 The same girl was found: Why does Villain like the same girl in the world whose affair is going on with the hero? People avoid committed girls even on Facebook by sending a friend request, but even after knowing this, the villain falls behind by washing his hands
 ladki agar haa kar de to bade-bade changez khaanon ke khet bik jate hai
 Then, after saying no, what does Villain's chessboard do? Pillow kalam le will sink: Villain works hard to repeat his pillow kalam
 kai baar villen ko hero isliye bhi maar daalata he kyonki ant tak main wo uske takiya kalam sun-sunakar pak chukaa hota he
 Leave it to my mother: When Villain is defeated after doing everything, he imprisons his mother and sister to call the hero
 ye uski sabase badi galati hoti he
 We are very centenary in the case of Indian families and after this action, the villain is sure to die or improve
 band karo ye naach-gaanaa:hero villen ke adde tak aayaa or uske gurgon ne use dhul chataakar kaid bhi kar liya

 Complete kill if you want to kill: Villain gets two hands with the hero
 villen ne hero ko jamkar dhuna
 Cut with a knife
 sarie se peeta or marane ke liye chhod heroin se guftgu karne chal padaa
 On this occasion, the villain forgets that in such a situation, after hearing the heroine's request, the corpse will first come to life, then two fingers will move and turn back and understand the world of the villain with a storm

 rashtriya chayansmiti ke adhyaksh krishnaamchaaree shrikant ne sweekaar kiya he ki bhartiya cricket team england daure ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar nahin thi lekin unhone kaha ki is haar ke liye chayankartaaon ko doshi tehraana sahi nahin hoga
 The Indian team is looking for the first win so far in the England tour
 test shrinkhalaa main 0-4 se parajeet hone ke baad use twanti-20 or mangalvaar ko duusare ekadivasiy match main bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Srikanth said, you can say that we were not fully prepared
 kuch khilaadi westeindies se sidhe vahaan pahunche
 The circumstances in England are slightly different, but the ICC FTP (future tour program) was decided long ago and even BCCI could do nothing about it
 bharat ne daure main apni number ek test ranking bhi ganvaayi lekin shrikant iske khilaadiyon kii aalochana karne or chayankartaaon par haar kaa dosha madhne ke khilaaf hai
 He told Headlines Today, that when things go wrong, then it makes no sense to blame
 yah ekmaatr shrinkhalaa rahi jisamen hamaare anukool kuch bhi nahin hua
 Why are you blaming the selectors for this defeat? shrikant ne kaha, bharat 20 maheene tak number ek team rahaa
 We beat New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies on their land and England had also beaten England on its soil four years ago but this time nothing was favorable to us
 shrikant ne sweekaar kiya ki yuva ballebaaj suresh raina ko short pich gendon ko khilne main pareshaani hoti he lekin yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki bharat kii bench strenth kamjor he
 The former Indian captain said, Raina will have to improve his technique especially in front of short pitch balls in Test matches
 lekin main is baat se sahamat nahin hum ki hamaari bench strength ( senior khilaadiyon kii jagah lene ke liye yuva khilaadiyon kaa pool) kamjor he
 This is the process
 pichley kuch vashren main jin yuva khilaadiyon ko mauka mila unhone acha pradarshan kiya
 Srikanth also defended the selection of injured players like Zaheer Khan and Virender Sehwag
 unhone kaha, team kaa sahvaag or jahir kii jarurat thi
 These players also thought they could try
 unhone kaha, jahaan tak sahvaag kaa sawaal he to hamen sweekaar karnaa chahie ki usne apni taraf se sarvshereshth prayaas kiya lekin use laga ki vah puri tarah se feet nahin he
 You do what the experts tell you, but after reaching there, he felt that he would not be able to walk
 desh ko uski jarurat thi
 He actually put the country above
 use laga ki desh ko uski sevaaon kii jarurat he
 Srikanth is likely to be retained again in this post but he declined to say anything on it
 unhone kaha, yah mere or board ke bich kaa masalaa he
 Such issues, like selection, are also not publicly discussed
 yah board kaa faisla hoga lekin hamen kuch dinon main pataa chal janaa chahie

 dilli ke udyog mantri satendra jain ab siem arvind kejariwal ke liye nai musiibat ban sakate hai
 Principal Secretary (industry) Shakuntala Gamlin has written a letter to Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung, accusing Jain of putting pressure on him
 najeeb jang ko likhe patr main pradhan sachiv (udyog) shakuntla gamelin ne dilli kii jameen se jude ek aise maamle ko uthaaya he jisame kejariwal ke udyog mantri satendra jain kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 In the letter, Gamlin wrote, 'satendra Jain was constantly pressurizing me to bring a cabinet note so that the industrial land can be held free from lease hold
 'patr main gamelin ne saaf likhaa he kibhumi kaa vishay dilli sarkaar ke adheen nahinhai
 Therefore, it is not right to bring a cabinet note in this case
 pradhan sachiv (udyog) ne likhaa he ki is maamle main faisla sirf didie or uske chairman najeeb jang hi kar sakate hai
 If the letter of Shakuntala Gamlin is considered to be the basis, it may prove to be a new blow to Kejriwal as the matter is directly related to his senior minister

 Why Kejriwal's problem may increase? Delhi has 18 industrial areas and thousands of industrial plots, all of which are on lease
 agar in ilaakon ko free hold kar diya jayega to inhen kabhi bhi badi aasaani se bina kisi kii ijaajat ke bechaa ja saktaa he jisamen hajaaron karod ke vaare-nyaare ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, if Kejriwal's Industries Minister Satendra Jain is in a hurry to bring the cabinet proposal, then the question arises whether he wants to benefit the land owners
 The allegations are serious and it will not be easy for Chief Minister Kejriwal to answer them, already surrounded by many controversies in the war of rights and rights
