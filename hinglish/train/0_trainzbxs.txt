'kharge said,' The government lied in court that the CAG report has been tabled in the House and the PAC
 unhone adaalat main yah bhi kaha ki piesi ne isaki jaanch kii he
 He claimed that the report is public (in the public domain)
 yah kahaan he? kya aapane ise dekha he? main piesi ke anya sadasyon ke samaksh is maamle ko le jane vaala hum
 The court had rejected the petition
 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected the pleas seeking a probe under the court's supervision of the Rafale deal
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki vimaan kii keemat kaig ke saath saajha kii gai or kaig kii rapat kii jaanch piesi ne kii
 Now only the edited portion of the report has been tabled in Parliament and is public
 'court ko gumraah karne ke liye sarkaar maange mafisarkaar par sarvocch nyaayalay ko 'gumraah' karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone sarkaar se iske liye maafee kii maang kii
 He said, 'the report has not yet been tabled in Parliament
 sarvocch nyaayalay main galat soochna pesh kii gai
 The government should apologize for misleading the court by presenting false facts on the CAG report in the Supreme Court
 'khadge ne yah bhi kaha ki vah sarvocch nyaayalay kaa aadar karte hai, lekin yah jaanch agency nahin he or keval sanyukt sansadeey samiti(jepisi) rafel maamle main kathith bhrashtachar kii jaanch kar sakati he
 What did Sanjay Singh say? Sanjay Singh said that when no investigation report of the CAG has come, then how did the government tell the Supreme Court that there is such an investigation report
 sarkaar ke atorni general ne bhi supreme court se kaha tha ki sil band lipaphe main jo kuch bhi diya gaya vah unhone nahin padhaa he to ab unhone karection kaa halafanama kaise diya? unhen vah silband report kahaan se mili?aap saansad ne kaha ki supreme court ke aadesh main zikr he ki airforce pramukh ne keemton ke khulaase par aapatti kii thi
 When did the Air Force Chief make this statement or any such affidavit? In the new affidavit, the government is saying that the CAG has been informed about the prices, but the CAG report will come only after January
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ne sarkaar ke halafname ke mutabik yah mana ki sieji or piesi keemton ko lekar pehle hi jaanch kar rahi he
 Perhaps this is why the Supreme Court did not order an inquiry into the Rafale scam
 agar court ko yah pataa hota ki aisi koi jaanch nahin hui he to shaayad is maamle main jaanch ke aadesh die jate
 Sibalbolle- The Center said at a press conference on Lyingrafel on Saturday that Sibal said that the government has given wrong information in the Rafale case in the Supreme Court
 ham chaahate hai ki piesi (lok lekha samiti) main atorni general ko bulaayaa janaa chahie, jisase yah saaf ho sake ki affidavit kyon jamaa karaae gaye, jiskaa vastav main koi zikr nahin he
 This is a very sensitive matter, which should also be discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki congress is maamle main hameshaa spasht rahi he ki is maamle ke liye supreme court sahi jagah nahin he, yahaan par har tarah kii file kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is also not under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
 unhone aage kaha ki supreme court ke har faisle main press report or sarkaar ke halafname kaa hawala diya gaya he
 The Supreme Court has also said in its order that they cannot decide due to the court's jurisdiction under Article 32

 Running in our theaters since Friday, director Amit Masurkar's Newton is like a breath of fresh air
 agar jaananaa chaahate hai, to ek baar hrishikesh mukherjee, sai paranjape or amol palekar kii filmein yaad kiijie
 The whole family could see them sitting together, because they reflected the innate harmony of social relations, there was no cheap violence and nakedness
 aisi gati kii kisi film main gaharaa rajnatik rujhaan daaliye, jaisaa ki '80 ke dashak kii shyaam benegal yaa govind nihalaani kii filmon main hua karata tha, lekin unki daraavnee talkhi hataa ke
 Now weave it into a tight screenplay
 usamen daaliye aise do prasang jo hamaari filmon or baatcheet main aamtaur par aate nahin
 That is, the attitude of administration towards Scheduled Tribes, and the general elections taking place between them
 is kahani ko paanch takaraane vaali bhoomikaaon main dhaal dijie
 Then catch five such fine actors who play their character closely, immersing them in the juice
 isse andaja lagegaa ki masurkar ne newton bana kar kya kar dikhaaya he
 By the way, the story is full of laughter
 lekin aap kaa rone kaa man bhi lagaataar hota rahegaa
 Without any bitterness, this film constantly snipes at us, it is a satire on our social and political disparities
 kala se agar hamaara manoranjan hota he, to vah hamen aaine main apni surat bhi dikhaati he
 It also shows what we do not want to believe about ourselves
 kahani khulti he hamaare aam chunaav ke anuthe vistaar ke saath
 We are introduced to Newton, whose parents named him Nutan Kumar
 vah ek adarshavaadi vyakti he jo apane parivaar or samaaj main bemail he
 He is a government employee who wants to do his work with integrity
 jab jangal ke bich rahane vaale 76 logon ke vot dalwane ke liye nirvachan adhikari kii jarurat hoti he, to vah hajir he
 This is not a jungle like this, trapped in the jungles of Chhattisgarh between Maoist rebels and armed forces
 newton kii bhoomika main rajkumaar raav ko yaad kiya jayega
 They have the property of showing the contradiction of a character
 bina chaatikuta yaa dramabaji ke
 His slow jerks also sound louder
 newton eemaandaaree se adivasee votaron ke vot dalwaanaa chahta he
 It is the responsibility of the armed force officer Atma Ram (pankaj Tripathi) to take the election party through the forest to the village
 newton kii nishtha main aatma ram ko nayaa mullah dikhaai detaa he, kyonki vah jangal main janaa nahin chahta
 He looks at the tribals contemptuously
 in donon ke tanaav ke bich main fansi he adivasee shikshika malko (anjali patil) or pite hue lekhak se sarkari babu bane lokanath (raghubir yadav)
 If Malco pulls the story towards Newton's morality, the spoiled Loknath brings him to Atma Ram
 dhire-dhire bodh hota he ki aisi khinchataan main adivasee logon se kaise kinare hote hai
 In these societies, there has been a democratic practice of taking unanimous decisions
 par hamaare nae loktantr main inke liye jagah nahin
 When Newton asks Malko if she is too pessimistic, she replies, "no, I'm a tribal
" ''hamaari filmein jab kabhi saamaajik vishyon ko gambhirtha se darshaati hai, to unamem sudhaarwadi upadesh aa jate hai
 As if the audience was not there, Abodh turned out to be a child, who is responsible for making the ideal citizen by beating and beating
 newton aisa kuch nahin karti, keval ek dilachasp kahani dikhalaati or manoranjan karti he, aisi nafasat ke saath ki darshak ke man main kathin sawaal uthte hai
 Questions that have no easy answer, which our t
 ve
 They are not even asked on the channels
 par ye sawaal hamaare liye jaruri hai
 Our conscience is reflected in them
 har paatr ko samvednaa ke saath dikhaaya gaya he
 At last, Atma Ram and his family appear to be buying olive oil, as it is now considered a development oil
 adivasee jangal par khanan company kii khadaanen khul jaati hai
 Malco comes to meet Newton, both of whom are tea drinkers
 itnaa gadabad dikhaane vaali kahani ek sundar sambhaavna par khatm hoti he
 Perhaps the government should also meet the tribal society, dialogue will lead to a way of understanding

 On Friday, just one outsider decided to leave the campus of NIT Srinagar

 When NDTV India wanted to talk to him, he was stopped
 use college prashasan ke log daudaate hue le gaye
 In college, it has been said that those who want to go can go
 lekin suraksha or kariyar ke kashmakash main fanse chaatr tay nahin kar paa rahe
 One student said, "we all want to test, but i do not understand what is happening
" " vaise kai sthaneey chaatr bhi apane ghar imtihaan kii taiyaari ke liye gaye
 a local student said, "in the college you can see what the atmosphere is like, how you will study here that's why you are going home
" " The other student said, "classes are taking place inside
 ham sab ab pariksha kii taiyaari main lage hue hai
 "well, April 11 examinations can also be postponed
 haalanki prashasan ne saafe kiya he ki agar parikshaayen na talin to baahar gaye bacchon ke parache baad main ho jaaenge
 Then the test will be under the supervision of outsiders
 itani sari tasalli ke bich abhibhavakon ke apane sawaal hai
 An anxious mother told NDTV outside the campus, "we have come to meet our baby girl, scared of what she is seeing in newspapers and TV everyday

 Fear of outside students is different and local students are different
 shuukravaar ko wo bhi campus main daakhil nahin ho paae
 a local student told, "there is so much police inside, what to say, it feels bad, we are not being allowed to go to many places inside ourselves, suspecting us in our own college
" " Amidst this tension, the matter is becoming a confrontation between locals and outsiders
 shikshak maayoos hai ki unpar bharosa nahin kiya ja rahaa
 They are reminding that local people helped these people in a crisis like flood
 sheikh mubashir jo bi-tech padhaate hai, unhone bataaya, "ham logon ne inhen apane bacchon kii tarah rakhaa, ab ham par ilzaam lag rahaa he, bahut dukh ho rahaa he

 chaatr chaahate hai ki unke upar lagi exiaar kaarij kar di jaae
 This is not a big deal
 zyaada bada sawaal ye he ki ek chote se vivaad se paidaa hua ye bada sankat kab tak khatm hoga
 When the leaders and the media leave, the students will eventually have to live together
 college main sabase kaha gaya he ki jo janaa chahen, ve ja sakate hai
 But students caught in the muddle of security and career are unable to decide
 ek chaatr ne kaha, "ham sab imtihaan dena chaahate hai lekin kya ho rahaa he samaj nahin aa rahaa
 "by the way many local students also went to their house to prepare for the examination
 ek sthaneey chaatr ne kaha, "college main aap dekh rahe ho kaisaa maahaul he, yahaan kaise padhai hogi isiilie ghar ja rahe hai
 " duusare chaatr ne kaha, "andar claces ho rahi hai
 We are all now preparing for the exam

 ' lokapal vidheyak par gathit sanyukt masauda samiti ke sadsy prashanth bhushan ne pradhanmantri pad ko is prastaavit bill ke daayre main rakhe jane kii jamkar pairvi kii he
 The Lokpal Bill is to be tabled in Parliament in the monsoon session starting from August 1
 varisht adhivaktaa kaa kahana he ki un logon ko samvidhan kii ‘abisi’ tak nahin aati jo sheersh raajnneetik pad ko ‘samvedansheel’ bataate hue bhrashtachar nirodhak vidheyak ke daayre se baahar rakhane kaa raag alaap rahe hai
 Bhushan, who came here in connection with the Linguistic Journalism Festival, said, "it seems that the government is adamant on keeping the Prime Minister's office out of the purview of the Lokpal Bill
" lekin iskaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 He stressed that the Prime Minister's post is not even beyond the investigation of corruption and the CBI can do this investigation
 bhushan ne kaha, ‘chunki kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) pradhanmantri ke adheen hota he
 Therefore, we say that investigation against the top political post will only make sense if the authority is independent of a government like Lokpal
 ’unhone kaha, ‘un logon ko samvidhan kii abisi tak kii samaj nahin he, jo kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri pad ko bhrashtachar nirodhak vidheyak ke daayre se baahar hona chaiye
 It is a matter of baseless feet
 ’varisht vakil ne kaha ki pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal vidheyak ke daayre se baahar rakhane ke liye daleel di ja rahi he ki yah ek ‘samvedansheel’ ohada he
 But there is no 'independent' and 'civilized' country in the world where the head of the executive goes beyond the investigation of corruption
 haalanki, sarkaar ke maujuuda sanketon ke aadhaar par bhushan se jab poocha gaya ki agar sansad main pesh kiye jane vaale lokapal vidheyak ke daayre main pradhanmantri pad ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya to gandhivadi anna hajaare paksh kaa rukh kya hoga to unhone kaha, ‘ham is mudde ko aisa nahin maanate, jis par philhal baatcheet nahin ho sakati
 When this issue will be discussed in the light of the Constitution, then the whole situation will become clear on its own
 ’unhone kaha ki lokapal vidheyak par sarkaar kaa maujuuda rukh ‘galat’ he or dikhaata he ki vah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf thos kadam uthaane ke liye gambhir nahin he
 Reiterating the imperative need for a strong Lokpal Bill to effectively curb corruption, Bhushan said, "anna Hazare has already declared that if the government presents the lax Lokpal Bill in Parliament, it will be fasted once again

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke chalate pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aaj varanasi se apana namakan patr daakhil kiya
 Earlier, PM Modi also visited Baba Kal Bhairav, who is called Kotwal of Kashi
 bhairav kaa shabdic arth hota he bhay se raksha karanevaala
 In Hinduism, Bhairav is described as riding a black dog with a large size black character, holding a pen in hand
 paapiyon ko dand dene kii pravriti kii vajah se inhen dandpani kahkar bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 In the scriptures, black dogs are considered to be the rides of Bhairava
 aise main aaie jaanate hai kaale kute ko roti khilaane se aapako kya laabh milte hai
 In Hinduism, a dog is considered a creature with sharp intellect
 kaha jaataa he ki kute ko khaanaa-khilaane se kaal bhairav khush hote hai
 Keeping a dog nearby prevents humans from accidental death
 buree atmaaen kabhi bhi kute ke paas nahin fatkati hai
 Let us know many such great benefits of raising a dog
 -kaale rang ke kute ko kalbhairav kii sawari mana jaataa he
 According to Hindu belief, Kalabhairava is pleased by feeding bread to a black dog and the person stays away from fear of accidental death
 -jyotishshastra main kute ko shani or ketu kaa pratik bhi mana jaataa he
 For the peace of both these planets, feeding a dog of black or black-white color is beneficial
 --yadi kisi vyakti kii kundali main kaalsarp yoga ho to us vyakti ko ghar main kaale kutta paalane kii salaah di jaati he taaki uski kundali main ketu or shani kii dasha shant rahen or jataka kii unnati ho sake
 Shani is pleased with the people who feed the dog
 pitru shanti ke liye bhi kutton ko mithi roti khilaani chahie
 By feeding bread daily to the dog, every kind of crisis is avoided
 -santan sukh main baadha aane par jataka ko kaala kutta paalane se laabh miltaa he
 This remedy is also considered auspicious for the health of children
 -shastron ke anusaar mana jaataa he ki kutta apane maalik par aane vaale sankat apane upar le letaa he
 Along with the freedom from the phantom barrier, giving bread to a black dog in the morning and evening also gives relief from debt
 pitrupaksh kaa prarambh 6 sitambar ko ho rahaa he or 19 sitambar ko samaapt hoga
 Meanwhile, in order to please your fathers, you know what to do, what to take care of and what not to do

 uddhav thakare ne bhi kaha ki vah in bayanon kaa samarthan nahin karte
 Modiji never reacted but whatever was written was unpleasant

 logon ke bich kanfujanabhale hi pehali najar main itane saare vikalp behatar najar aa sakate hai, lekin ye logon ke man main kanfusion bhi paidaa karte hai
 Despite having so many options, if cashless transactions are not increasing, one of the main reasons for this is lack of awareness
 bharat main aaj bhi kai log hai, jinhen atm se paise nikaalane ke liye bhi madad kii jarurat hoti he
 In such a situation, if we want to motivate these people to do cashless transactions, you need to make them aware about using them
 gramin kshetra main badhaani hogi pahunchashahron main bhale hi mobile wolet or cashles lenden ko lekar halchal dikh rahi he, lekin gramin kshetron main yah halchal kaaphi kam he
 In such a situation, awareness is also needed to promote cashless transactions in rural areas
 unhen na sirf in vikalpon ke bare main bataaya janaa chahie balki inhen istemaal karnaa bhi sikhaaya janaa chahie
 Businessmen have to give incentives
 Even though the government is promoting cashless transactions, traders and shopkeepers have to pay a charge to use the POS machine
 agar is charge main katautee kii jaae
 In addition, if the shopkeepers are given incentives for making cashless payments, it can also reduce the cash usage
 pioes mashiinon kii sankhya badhanadesh main 70 karod se zyadadebit card yugersahai, lekin point of cells (pioes) kii sankhya kaaphi kam he
 In such a situation, the government will have to focus on increasing the number of POS
 debit-credit charge kam hokai bank aaj bhidebit or credit cardse lenden karne par charge vasuulate hai
 If banks consider reducing or eliminating these charges, then it can also prove to be a step to boost the cashless economy

 In Jharkhand's capital Ranchi, now there is no good for open defecators
 ranchi nagar nigam ne khule main shouch karne vaale ke khilaaf 'hallaa bol, lungi khol' abhiyaan chhedaa he
 Under this, the Municipal Corporation Enforcement Team invades those places where people often go for open defecation in the early morning
 aise hi ek vaakye main harmu ke logon ko khule main shouch karnaa mahangaa pad gaya
 Here the people of open defecation were caught by the Municipal Corporation Enforcement Team and got their lungi removed, not only their lungi was also seized
 sabhi apni lungi waapas maangate rahe, lekin kisi ne unki ek na suni, baad main jab giraft main aaye logon ne phir se khule main shouch na karne kii shapath lee or 100 rupee bataur jurmaana chukaaya to nagar nigam kii team le lungi waapas kar di
 In fact, this campaign is being run in the entire district
 iske tahat nagar nigam kii enforcement timen pehle se chinhit kii gai jagahon par subah hi pahunch jaati hai or aise logon ko target karti hai jo khule main shouch karte hai
 However, earlier the Municipal Corporation had appealed many times not to defecate people in the open
 lekin jab logon par iskaa koi asar nahin padaa tab nagar nigam ne yah abhiyaan chalaaya
 According to the officials of the corporation, due to this campaign, the number of toilets is being seen gradually but rightly

 Also, more than half of the toilets that have been built are facing water problems
 vahiin kai jagahon par jo shauchalay banawaye gaye hai unki baraabar se dekhbhaal nahin ho rahi he
 In such a situation, people are also forced to defecate in the open

 es
 P
 singh ne kaha ki jab transporter ko kharch zyada uthaanaa padegaa to isaki vasuuli vah aam janata se vasulegaa
 Currently, diesel costs 40% of the transport, which is a huge stake, so when the diesel prices rise, the cost of direct transport increases
 espi singh kii maane to aane vaale dinon main transport mahangaa hone kii vajah se rosemara kii jarurat ke saamaan bhi mahange ho jaaenge
 Major transporters in Delhi are also serious about the current diesel prices

 In this research, the researchers included 97 drinks and 12 artificially sweetened beverages
 jinamein carbonated, sports drink, syrup or shuddh falon ke ras shaamil the
 Research has found that diseases like cancer are not born only through beverages
 shodhakartaaon ke anumaan lagaaya ki chini kaa vyakti kii aant,sugar ke str or sharir main sujan ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 In this French study, researchers found that consuming sugar-free drinks did not increase the risk of cancer
 khaas baat yah he ki pani, bina chini vaali chaay or coffee bhi is jokhim ko badhaate hue najar nahin aae
 Let me tell you, this research has been done in neutrinet-sante, France, which is part of a web-based study

 official # baaghi2onmarch30a post shared bydisha patani (paatni)(@dishapatani) onmar 26, 2018 at 11:08pm PDT No one imagined the bad effects of the film Kalank, which released on April 17, at the box office
 bhavy set, baari bharkam starcast, maadhuri dikshit-sanjay dutt kaa kambek bhi tikat khidki par kalank ko phayda nahin pahunchaa sakaa
 The film was Karan Johar's dream project
 aise main khabar ai ki kalank kii asafalataa ke baad diarector abhishek varman or karan johar ke bich rishte bighad gaye hai
 It was said that due to poor direction of Abhishek Varman, Kalank got negative publicity
 ab nai report ke mutabik, abhishek varman or karan johar ke bich anban kii khabaren galat hai
 Abhishek Varman is quite upset due to the response received by Kalank
 isliye karan johar ne abhishek ko bharosa dilaayaa ki ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 View this post on instagrama film that was born in my heart and mind 15 years ago
 
 
 
 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn’t fulfil his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven,nurtured and visualised by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40’s but it’s heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited 
 
 
 anxious and emotional about this one
 
 
 i do hope you join us on our path to undying love

 lav jehad andolan striyon ke naam par sampradayik lamabandi kii taaja koshish he
 As a historian, i see its roots in the colonial past as well
 jab-jab sampradayik tanaav or dangon kaa maahaul majboot hua he, tab-tab is tarah ke myth or prachaar saamne aae hai
 In these promotions, the Muslim man is specifically projected as a kidnapper and the image of a 'sensual' Muslim is fabricated
 maine 1920-30 ke dashak main uttar pradesh main sampradayikta or youniktaa main ubhar rahe rishte par kaam kiya he
 The term love jihad was not used at that time, but even at that time a large part of many Hindu organizations — Arya Samaj, Hindu Mahasabha etc
 — propagated many stories of Muslim goons kidnapping Hindu women and converting
 unhone bhadakaau or laffaaji bhare vaktavy die jinamein musalamaanon ke hindu mahilaon par atyaachaar or vyabhichaar kii anginat kahaniyaan gadhi gayi
 These statements were such that there was a long list of stories of Hindu women being raped, aggressive behavior, abducted, seduced, converted and forced by Muslim men to marry Hindu women
 antardharmik vivaah, prem, ek stri kaa apni marji se sahavaas or dharmantaran ko bhi samuhik rup se apharan or jabaran dharmantaran kii shrenee main daal diya gaya
 Many more issues were also involved in the campaign then and now
 hindu prachaarkon ko lagata he ki isse hamaare samaaj main jo jaateey bhedbhaav hai, unako darkinar kar sakate hai or hindu samuhikta ko ekajute kar sakate hai
 If we take up the issue of cow protection, it will not attract Dalits
 lekin auraton kaa mudda aisa he jisase jati ko pare rakhkar sabhi hinduon ko lamaband kiya ja saktaa he
 The woman's body becomes a central symbol for Hindu preachers
 lav jehad or apharan andolan, donon hinduon kii sankhya ke sawaal se bhi jude hai
 It is repeatedly said that Hindu women are marrying Muslim men and increasing the number of Muslims
 vibhinn surveykshan is baat ko puri tarah khaarij kar chuke hai
 In fact, Hindu propagandists also want to control the reproduction of Hindu women through such campaigns
 meraa maananaa he ki har balaatkaar yaa jabaran dharmantaran kii chaanbin honi chahie or aparaadhiyon ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 But the problem arises when we start looking at different events with the same glasses, when we start examining love, romance and every inter-religious marriage from the perspective of forced conversion
 gaur talab he ki 1920-30 ke dashak main kai aise maamle saamne aae jinamein striyon ne apni marji se musalmaan purushon ke saath vivaah kiya
 These included especially women who were marginalized in Hindu society, such as widows, Dalit women and some prostitutes
 tab hinduon main vidhwaa vivaah nammaatr kaa tha
 In such a situation, many widows married Muslims
 inaki jaankaree hamen us samay kii police or siidi reporton se bhi milti he
 It is also contradictory that in Hinduism propaganda when a Hindu woman marries a Muslim man she is presented as a kidnapping
 jab musalmaan stri hindu purush ke saath vivaah karti he, to use prem kii sangya di jaati he
 Many such stories and novels were written in colonial Uttar Pradesh, in which such Hindu men were introduced as amazing heroes who succeeded in loving a Muslim woman
 ek mashhoor upanyaas shivaji va roshanara is samay prakashit hua, jise apramanit sutron ke hawaale se aitihaasik bataaya gaya
 In this, by filling the color of Maratha tradition, it was shown that Shivaji won the heart of Roshanara, sister of Aurangzeb
 usase vivaah rachaaya, jo aitihaasik tathy nahin he
 In the name of protecting Hindu women, movements like Love Jihad actually want to control her sexuality, her will and her independent identity
 saath hi ve akasar hindu stri ko aise darshaate hai jaise vah aasaani se phuslaa lee ja sakati he
 She may have her own existence, her own desire, or she herself can take the step of interreligious love and marriage — this thinking is sidelined
 mujhe iske peeche ek bhay bhi najar aata he kyonki auraten ab khud apane faisle le rahi hai
 Another feature of hate-spewing campaigns is the repetition of the same thing, so that it becomes included in the general knowledge of the people
 lav jehad andolan main aisa jhootha doharaav bahut najar aata he, jisase sampradayikta majboot hoti he
 Love Jihad has also added many new things, including a new vocabulary against Muslims - terrorism and militant Muslims, Muslim communalism, aggressive Muslim youth, foreign funds and international conspiracy
 is tarah ke dushprachaar se sampradayik maahaul main to ijapha hua he, lekin yah bhi sach he ki mahilaon ne antardharmik prem or vivaah ke jariye sampradayik lamabandi kii koshishon main bhi send lagaai he
 Ambedkar had said that inter-caste marriage can end casteism
 meraa maananaa he ki antardharmik vivaah, dharmik pahchaan ko kamjor kar saktaa he
 Women have not paid attention to such communal propaganda many times at their level
 jo mahilaayein antardharmik vivaah karti hai, ve kahin-na-kahin saamudayik or sampradayik kilabandi main send lagaati hai
 Romance and love can demolish such propaganda

 The market is coming soon
 nae saal main puri kii apni rachanah shampen dit
 Celebrate and lose weight
 pustak anshsamay se pehle meraa janm hua tha, vajan tha maatr 2
 5 kg main ek saal kii hui, tab overvet thi-or yah tab tha, jab khaane kii meri chois maish kiye seb or kele tak simit thi
 At the age of four, i was able to exchange meals with my friends in pre-school
 mere paas unki chocolate trufal pastery hoti thi or unke paas meri nal ke pani se bhari bottle
 i was on my first diet at the age of four
 uske baad maine kabhi palat kar nahin dekha
 Since then i have tried 40 programs of diet (catering) and workout (workout)
 inamen se kuch to do-do baar kiye hai
 i confess that i am a serial dieter
 main 55 kilo kii bhi ho chuki hum or 104 kilo kii bhi
 i have a weighty list of abilities
 main koi guru nahin hum
 Lean doctors and fit dieticians can constantly talk about healthy ways to lose weight, but they do not understand the mind, mood and impudence of an obese person
 unhone vah fat suut kabhi nahin pahana hota he
 They have never seen that path
 lekin chunki ve ek hi samasya vaale itane saare logon se milte hai or unki madad karte hai, isliye unke paas vastav main kuch achche samaadhaan or nazariye hote hai
 Despite this, the thing is not the same
 diaticiuns or trainurs aapako bataa sakate hai ki kya karnaa he or use karne main madad kar sakate hai
 But they themselves would not have done what i did
 kayakalp ke bare main ek jaani-maani nitiktha he- da agli dakaling
 An ugly duck turns into a beautiful swan
 jab vah badsoorat hoti he tab har koi usase kinaaraa kar letaa he
 She is lonely and sad
 lekin jab vah ek khubasurat hans ban jaati he tab har koi use chaahane lagata he or usase dosti karnaa chahta he
 Fables are different from horror and traditional thinking, but that's what we grew up with
 yah aapke dilo-dimag main rachi-basii hoti haih mote or badsoorat mashr nahin hote; duble or khubasurat har dil ajij hote hai
 But once you reduce your weight by 20 kg or more, it is not the same as turning an ugly duck into a beautiful goose; This is complete change, rejuvenation
 is kism kaa kayakalp vaisaa hi he, jaise kisi illi kaa titali ban janaa
 23 November 2011: See India Today in Pictures 16 November 2011: See India Today in Pictures This conversion is not just looking the other way, but living in another way
 titali or illi do alag jivan jite hai
 One is delicate, attractive and beautiful
 duusari moti, roendaar or bhaddi
 One hovers and flies
 duusari ghistate hue chalati he
 One drinks only the juice of flowers, the other eats what he gets
 45 kilo vajan kam karnaa usee tarah he
 It gave me a completely new person
 aaj, log aksar mujhase poochhate hai, ''tum apana baaki hissaa kahaan chhod ai?'' unhen ehsaas nahin hota ki ve sach ke kitne kareeb hai
 i came to 58 kg with a three digit weight
 main 45 kilo vajan kam kar chuki hum or ginati ab bhi jari he
 i am surprised at things that have become smaller and thinner
 ve sab sharir ke aasaani se najar aane vaale ang hai- pet, kuulhe, jaanghen; haathon or pindliyon jaise kathor hisse; or kahin zyada numaayan sharir kaa upree hissaa
 After this, there are lesser organs, such as neck, fingers, feet
 main dress kii sies ke lihaaj se das ank choti ho chuki hum, sies 18 se sies 8 tak
 i have also lost weight in other organs, from those parts where fat accumulates and you don't even know
 charbi bina aawaaj kiye maarane waalon main se he, vah aapke irdagird ikatthi hoti he, aapako sust, dhimaa or nikamma bana detii he
 Fat is contagious, so your brain also starts losing its edge
 vah bhi us sharir kii tarah sust ho jaataa he, jis sharir main vah rahata he
 My mind is agile and alert and i am a goddess who can do many things
 9 november2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today2 november 201: tasveeron main dekhen india todewah seemaa rekha kya he, jab aapako pataa chalata he ki aap laalach se ladane main sakasham hai? jab aap ghar se baahar nikalati hai, or andhadhundh kha-pikar nahin lautati hai? yah aapke mul vajan, lakshith vajan or ichhashakti kaa ek jatil sameekaran he
 But i can easily say that reducing the weight by 5 to 7 kg is enough to reverse the game
 or agar aapkaa vajan, aapke adarsh vajan se 20 kilo yaa usase bhi zyada he, to 5 kilo kam kar lenaa bahut kathin nahin he, lekin vajan kam karne ke lihaaj se yah acha-khaasaa he
 And you are motivated to retain this reduced weight
 to, jab laalach hota he tab bhi, aapkaa dimag aapako duusari salaah detaa he or aap laalach par roak lagane main sakasham ho jate hai
 So, how did i become socialized? The truth is that i did not exist, not on my own initiative
 raat main baahar nikalnaa mere liye bahut kathin hota tha
 One, because the dinner plan meant that i would sit at the table drinking Diet Coke and watching the rest of the people party
 haalanki isse mujhe auron se behatar hone kaa ehsaas hota tha, lekin mujhe apni puri dit kii safai deni padati thi, jisase baaki logon main aparadhbodh paidaa hota tha
 Drinks and snacks at cocktail parties attracted much
 sweet chile sos main duboya gaya sirf ek bydard pron, ek kurkura spring role, ek tandoori paneer, california sushi kaa ek tukdaa or bas
 My husband loved me so much that he did not force me to go out
 unhone kabhi is baat ke liye jor nahin daalaa ki main unke saath dinar karun
 i kept eating alone for poor months
 lekin main unki bhi kalpana kar sakati hum, badlaav hausala badhaane vaale the kyonki ve apni 100 kilo kii bivi ko waapas nahin chaahate the
 He never insisted that i lose weight, because it ended in a fight, but he played the supporting role in an Oscar-worthy manner
 do maheene tak main raat ko baahar nahin nikali
 i used to feel so full of stomach that i was not tempted to eat
 sach kaha janaa chahie, diating kaa no-dinar niyam yakeenan sakht he, kyonki zyaadaatar baar soshlising dinar ke irdagird hoti he
 And the best way to avoid greed is to stay away from it
 aapako keemat to chukaani hi padati he
 And it is a small price to pay
 main isaki bajaae doston se coffee par mulaakaat karne lagi
 i was allowed to drink coffee at six o'clock
 vah meraa dinar hota tha
 This worked well
 maine dinars or partiyon main khud ko tabhi jane diya, jab meraa dimag majboot ho gaya, meraa pet chota ho gaya or meraa warderob or aakarshak ho gaya
 Once the body becomes rum in the new routine, your lost weight motivates and encourages you not to cheat
 aapkaa dimag, sharir, aatma sab kuch acha chakhne kii bajaae acha najar aane ke ankush main funs jate hai
 When i started looking and feeling better i started to feel like going out
 meri yojana dinar kii kam or apni nai poshaak dikhaane kii zyada hoti thi
 i would drink a glass of champagne or white wine and not open my mouth for anything else
 yahaan tak ki duniya kii sabase acchhee dishes ko chakhne ke liye bhi nahin
 Sometimes i used to return home late and eat fruit or yogurt
 ek baar maine raat ko der se khaanaa khaane kaa pattern tod diya, subah maine kaaphi acha mahasoos kiya
 i was fresh and hungry and ready to workout and have breakfast
 kaaphi der se or jamkar dinar karke so jane par main subah hameshaa susti, ubakaai mahasoos karti thi or naashte ke liye bhukh nahin lagati thi
 xxrep 5 * Sister's wedding is a great reason to lose weight
 shaadi do maheene baad thi or mujhe laga ki ki meraa sharir 80 kilo se kam kaa vajan sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 i reduced to 75 kg and then returned to 79 kg
 har koi mujhase kahata tha ki main kitni acchhee dikh rahi hum
 At first i believed him, this weakened the motivation to lose more weight
 lekin jab maine tasviren dekhin, to mujhe pataa chalaa ki ve sabhi jhooth bol rahe the
 Or they may not have spoken
 unki tarif tulanaatmak hoti thi
 "you look so much better now than you were before
" '' mere liye ab yah kaaphi nahin rah gaya tha

 The party continued for several weeks after the bride and groom returned from their honeymoon and so did my friendship with food
 is dauraan, paimaana phir sarak kar 80 par pahunch rahaa tha
 Then the same 4 kg
 75 se 79 kii daud main kareeb chaar baar laga chuki thi or isse ajiz aane lagi thi
 My family doctor said that my body is at its average weight
 har kisi kaa ausat vajan hota he or meraa 79 se 80 kilo kaa tha
 i was not ready to accept it
 maine ise sustaane vaale ek padaav ke taur par dekha
 The body needed time to adjust to the new weight, as i was demanding a tremendous change
 mere liye khushkismati se ek shaadi kaaphi nahin thi or meri bahan dobaaraa shaadi kar rahi thi
 From the same person
 yah shaadi isai tareeke se paanch maheene ke andar france main honi thi
 Where there will be no anarkalis or saris to hide the thick body, but there will be tight dresses that show them
 mujhe or zyada vajan ghataane kii jarurat thi or mujhe yah kaam teji se karnaa tha
 For a French wedding, i wanted to keep my weight between 60 and 70 kg
 yahaan tak ki 69
 5 kg will also run
 main puri chhavi hi badalanaa chaahati thi
 My makeover team (dieticians, trainers and designers) were as excited as i was
 ve chaahate the ki ab mujhe poshaak pahanaakar dekha jaae
 There was no time to show him wearing a dress before leaving for the wedding
 france pukaar rahaa tha
 France served as an inspiration to stay steadfast on the road
 jab main shaadi se lauti, to mujhe tab bhi usee dress main feet aana tha, taaki main us team ko dikhaa sakuun, jisane sabase pehle mujhe is dress main aane main madad kii thi
 The wedding was fantastic
 yah ek jhil ke paas chote-se gaanv enecy main hui thi
 Eating was a big role in marriage
 shampen kii bhoomika usase bhi badi thi
 My brothers-in-law are French
 jab bhartiya log shaadi karte hai, to ve apane saath apana parivaar lekar jate hai ; french, haa, ve sirf shampen le jate hai
 We were drinking it like we were drinking water
 hamaari subah kii shuruyaat shampen or andey kii bhurji ke saath hoti thi or khaane-pine kaa silsilaa sara din chalate-chalate der raat tab khatm hota tha, jab ham ise shampen pikar hi khatm karte the
 And then also a champagne for a lift to the street or your room
 ham apane daant bhi isi cheez se brush kar rahe the
 i was very deprived for several weeks
 or isamen badi traasadee hone kaa andeshaa tha
 There was no process of slowly adjusting here
 ek din main dahi-papeeta kha rahi thi or duusare din main french pastries, chiz, bigus, quesan or shampen kii duniya main bahut gahare thi
 Negligence in a wrong country
 lekin main ascharyajanak dhang se acchhee thi
 i used to do Suryanamaskar daily
 vah bhi france main, jahaan hotalon ke kamare bahut-bahut chote hone ke liye jane jate hai
 i used to stand in a tight space between two beds and used to work from it
 mujhe kya ho gaya tha? thik he, mujhe waapas lautne ke baad bhi usee dress main feet samaanaa tha or jab tak main 15 se 20 minute yoga nahin kar leti thi, mujhe kuch acha mahasoos nahin hota tha
 It was built into my system
 main us tarah kii-ek yoganik ho rahi thi
 Or maybe champagne is making a prank with my brain
 yah dincharya us idia ke liye bhi kaam karne vaali thi
 a diet that contains lots of champagne
 xxrep 5 * aapako pehle hi chetavanee de di gai thi
 All you dieticians and trainers will be shocked when you read this, but this book is meant to tell you what you have eaten
 lihaaja aap kripaya is hisse ko chhod dijie
 All other serial dieters - you keep reading
 yah dit gaiyr-paramparaagat he or isaki jaden kisi gyaan main nahin, balki bahut saare anubhav main hai
 And i like it very much
 yah puri tarah meraa apana mishran he
 And like every great invention, this discovery too happened just by coincidence
 lekin maine ise jaancha or parkhaa
 i improved it
 or aapako iskaa puri tarah taraasha hua swaroop mil rahaa he
 But i do not take responsibility for anything more than the fact that i have done it and it has worked for me
 jis hafte aap party kar rahe hon-jaise ki shaadi main yaa lambey saptahanth main-usamen yah aapke liye sabase badhiya dit he
 As i told you earlier, my brother-in-law is French
 ve shampen aise pite hai, jaise angrej chaay pite hai
 anytime anywhere
 ve chaay ke liye ghar aate the or yah saamaanya sa chaay-samosa-jalebi jaisaa maamla hota tha
 When i asked them what they would like to drink, they seemed uneasy for a moment, looked at my sister for sure and when she volunteered a cold breath, they would say, "champagne
" , Please! ”at four in the evening! Because as far as i remember, our traditional Ravivariya family lunch was Chicken Biryani and Paratha, a menu that has been around for generations
 isamen koi pherbadal nahin hua, lekin parivaar main ek french ke shaamil hone ke baad se, ravivaar kii dincharya main shampen ek anivaary nayaa judaav ho gaya he
 It has now become a family tradition
 nateeja yah he ki main shampen kii acchhee khaasi aadi ho gai hum
 And this diet starts from here
 samay se pehle meraa janm hua tha, vajan tha maatr 2
 5 kg main ek saal kii hui, tab overvet thi-or yah tab tha, jab khaane kii meri chois maish kiye seb or kele tak simit thi
 At the age of four, i was able to exchange meals with my friends in pre-school
 mere paas unki chocolate trufal pastery hoti thi or unke paas meri nal ke pani se bhari bottle
 i was on my first diet at the age of four
 uske baad maine kabhi palat kar nahin dekha
 Since then i have tried 40 programs of diet (catering) and workout (workout)
 inamen se kuch to do-do baar kiye hai
 28 September 2011: See pictures in India Today 21 September 2011: Look in pictures India Today 7 September 2011: Look in pictures India Today i confess i am a serial dieter
 main 55 kilo kii bhi ho chuki hum or 104 kilo kii bhi
 i have a weighty list of abilities
 main koi guru nahin hum
 Lean doctors and fit dieticians can constantly talk about healthy ways to lose weight, but they do not understand the mind, mood and impudence of an obese person
 unhone vah fat suut kabhi nahin pahana hota he
 They have never seen that path
 lekin chunki ve ek hi samasya vaale itane saare logon se milte hai or unki madad karte hai, isliye unke paas vastav main kuch achche samaadhaan or nazariye hote hai
 Despite this, the thing is not the same
 diaticiuns or trainurs aapako bataa sakate hai ki kya karnaa he or use karne main madad kar sakate hai
 But they themselves would not have done what i did
 kayakalp ke bare main ek jaani-maani nitiktha he- da agli dakaling
 An ugly duck turns into a beautiful swan
 jab vah badsoorat hoti he tab har koi usase kinaaraa kar letaa he
 She is lonely and sad
 lekin jab vah ek khubasurat hans ban jaati he tab har koi use chaahane lagata he or usase dosti karnaa chahta he
 Fables are different from horror and traditional thinking, but that's what we grew up with
 yah aapke dilo-dimag main rachi-basii hoti haih mote or badsoorat mashr nahin hote; duble or khubasurat har dil ajij hote hai
 But once you reduce your weight by 20 kg or more, it is not the same as turning an ugly duck into a beautiful goose; This is complete change, rejuvenation
 is kism kaa kayakalp vaisaa hi he, jaise kisi illi kaa titali ban janaa
 This transformation is not just about looking the other way, but living in another way
 titali or illi do alag jivan jite hai
 One is delicate, attractive and beautiful
 duusari moti, roendaar or bhaddi
 One hovers and flies
 duusari ghistate hue chalati he
 One drinks only the juice of flowers, the other eats what he gets
 45 kilo vajan kam karnaa usee tarah he
 It gave me a completely new person
 aaj, log aksar mujhase poochhate hai, ''tum apana baaki hissaa kahaan chhod ai?'' unhen ehsaas nahin hota ki ve sach ke kitne kareeb hai
 i came to 58 kg with a three digit weight
 main 45 kilo vajan kam kar chuki hum or ginati ab bhi jari he
 i am surprised at things that have become smaller and thinner
 ve sab sharir ke aasaani se najar aane vaale ang hai- pet, kuulhe, jaanghen; haathon or pindliyon jaise kathor hisse; or kahin zyada numaayan sharir kaa upree hissaa
 After this, there are lesser organs, such as neck, fingers, feet
 main dress kii sies ke lihaaj se das ank choti ho chuki hum, sies 18 se sies 8 tak
 i have also lost weight in other organs, from those parts where fat accumulates and you don't even know
 charbi bina aawaaj kiye maarane waalon main se he, vah aapke irdagird ikatthi hoti he, aapako sust, dhimaa or nikamma bana detii he
 Fat is contagious, so your brain also starts losing its edge
 vah bhi us sharir kii tarah sust ho jaataa he, jis sharir main vah rahata he
 My mind is agile and alert and i am a goddess who can do many things
 vah seemaa rekha kya he, jab aapako pataa chalata he ki aap laalach se ladane main sakasham hai? jab aap ghar se baahar nikalati hai, or andhadhundh kha-pikar nahin lautati hai? yah aapke mul vajan, lakshith vajan or ichhashakti kaa ek jatil sameekaran he
 But i can easily say that reducing the weight by 5 to 7 kg is enough to reverse the game
 or agar aapkaa vajan, aapke adarsh vajan se 20 kilo yaa usase bhi zyada he, to 5 kilo kam kar lenaa bahut kathin nahin he, lekin vajan kam karne ke lihaaj se yah acha-khaasaa he
 And you are motivated to retain this reduced weight
 to, jab laalach hota he tab bhi, aapkaa dimag aapako duusari salaah detaa he or aap laalach par roak lagane main sakasham ho jate hai
 So, how did i become socialized? The truth is that i did not exist, not on my own initiative
 raat main baahar nikalnaa mere liye bahut kathin hota tha
 One, because the dinner plan meant that i would sit at the table drinking Diet Coke and watching the rest of the people party
 haalanki isse mujhe auron se behatar hone kaa ehsaas hota tha, lekin mujhe apni puri dit kii safai deni padati thi, jisase baaki logon main aparadhbodh paidaa hota tha
 Drinks and snacks at cocktail parties attracted much
 sweet chile sos main duboya gaya sirf ek bydard pron, ek kurkura spring role, ek tandoori paneer, california sushi kaa ek tukdaa or bas
 My husband loved me so much that he did not force me to go out
 unhone kabhi is baat ke liye jor nahin daalaa ki main unke saath dinar karun
 i kept eating alone for poor months
 lekin main unki bhi kalpana kar sakati hum, badlaav hausala badhaane vaale the kyonki ve apni 100 kilo kii bivi ko waapas nahin chaahate the
 He never insisted that i lose weight, because it ended in a fight, but he played the supporting role in an Oscar-worthy manner
 do maheene tak main raat ko baahar nahin nikali
 i used to feel so full of stomach that i was not tempted to eat
 sach kaha janaa chahie, diating kaa no-dinar niyam yakeenan sakht he, kyonki zyaadaatar baar soshlising dinar ke irdagird hoti he
 And the best way to avoid greed is to stay away from it
 aapako keemat to chukaani hi padati he
 And it is a small price to pay
 main isaki bajaae doston se coffee par mulaakaat karne lagi
 i was allowed to drink coffee at six o'clock
 vah meraa dinar hota tha
 This worked well
 maine dinars or partiyon main khud ko tabhi jane diya, jab meraa dimag majboot ho gaya, meraa pet chota ho gaya or meraa warderob or aakarshak ho gaya
 Once the body becomes rum in the new routine, your lost weight motivates and encourages you not to cheat
 aapkaa dimag, sharir, aatma sab kuch acha chakhne kii bajaae acha najar aane ke ankush main funs jate hai
 When i started looking and feeling better i started to feel like going out
 meri yojana dinar kii kam or apni nai poshaak dikhaane kii zyada hoti thi
 i would drink a glass of champagne or white wine and not open my mouth for anything else
 yahaan tak ki duniya kii sabase acchhee dishes ko chakhne ke liye bhi nahin
 Sometimes i used to return home late and eat fruit or yogurt
 ek baar maine raat ko der se khaanaa khaane kaa pattern tod diya, subah maine kaaphi acha mahasoos kiya
 i was fresh and hungry and ready to workout and have breakfast
 kaaphi der se or jamkar dinar karke so jane par main subah hameshaa susti, ubakaai mahasoos karti thi or naashte ke liye bhukh nahin lagati thi
 xxrep 5 * Sister's wedding is a great reason to lose weight
 shaadi do maheene baad thi or mujhe laga ki ki meraa sharir 80 kilo se kam kaa vajan sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 i reduced to 75 kg and then returned to 79 kg
 har koi mujhase kahata tha ki main kitni acchhee dikh rahi hum
 At first i believed him, this weakened the motivation to lose more weight
 lekin jab maine tasviren dekhin, to mujhe pataa chalaa ki ve sabhi jhooth bol rahe the
 Or they may not have spoken
 unki tarif tulanaatmak hoti thi
 "you look so much better now than you were before
" '' mere liye ab yah kaaphi nahin rah gaya tha
 i wanted a compliment that did not compare to anyone
 shaadi, khaane or shampen kaa mela tha
 The party continued for several weeks after the bride and groom returned from their honeymoon and so did my friendship with food
 is dauraan, paimaana phir sarak kar 80 par pahunch rahaa tha

 marathi bhashaa main uddhav thakare ne shapath licongress, NCP, shivasena ke tamaam netaa maujuudamaharashtra main thakare sarkaar kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 On Thursday, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray took oath of chief minister at the historic Shivaji Park in Mumbai
 shapath ke saath hi uddhav thakare mukhyamantri kii kursi par virajman hone vaale thakare khandaan ke pehle sadsy ho gaye
 All the big leaders of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena were present in the swearing-in ceremony
 samaaroh main kai rajyon ke siem bhi pahunche
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray also attended it
 shivajimaharaj ko naman karte hue marathi bhashaa main uddhav ne shapath lee or vethacrapariwaar se pehle mukhyamantri hai
 Other ministers of the cabinet are being sworn in after Uddhav
 uddhav thakare ke baad shivasena ke ekanath scindia, subhash desai ko mantripad kii shapath dilaai gai
 Subsequently, legislative party leaders Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal were sworn in from NCPCOT
 yahaan padhein maharashtra sarkaar kii pal-pal kii khabarmaharashtra menshivsenaki neenv rakhane vaale bal thakare ke bete uddhav kaa janm 27 july 1960 ko bombai main hua tha
 He got his early education from Balmohan Vidya Mandir
 iske baad unhone sar jeje institute of aplide art se ucch shiksha hasil kii
 Political career of Uddhav Thackeray The foundation of Shiv Sena was laid in 1966 by Uddhav's father, Babasaheb Thackeray
 jab tak bala sahib thakare raajnneeti main sakriy rahe tab tak uddhav raajnneetik paridrishy se lagbhag dur hi rahe yaa phir unke peeche hi khadey dikhe
 However, Uddhav used to look after the work of Saamna's newspaper Saamna before taking charge of the party and its editor too
 haalanki baad main bal thakare kii badhati umr or kharaab sehat ke kaaran unhone 2000 ke baad party ke kaamkaaj ko dekhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 In 2003, the Shiv Sena was a huge success in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in 2002 and the credit was given to Uddhav Thackeray
 iske baad bal thakare ne apni raajnneetik viraasat uddhav ko saunpi
 In January 2003, Uddhav was made the acting president of the Shiv Sena
 kam bolne vaale uddhav thakare ko jab bal thakare ne shivasena ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa to kai logon ko aashcharya hua tha, kyonki party ke baahar kai log unka naam tak nahin jaanate the or raaj thakare sambhavit uttaradhikari ke rup main jane jate the
 But unhappy with Bal Thackeray choosing his son Uddhav as successor, Raj Thackeray left the party in 2006 and formed a new party - the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena
 himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki cement ke daam kam karaane ke liye sarkaar cement companiyon ko manaane main lagaataar lagi hui he
 In response to the charge leveled by the opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the Question Hour in the Assembly, Singh said, 'for this a committee headed by the Industry Minister constituted by the government is working
 'unhone kaha ki yah ek gambhir baat he ki himachal main cement kaa utpaadan hone ke baavjood anya rajyon kii tulana main yahaan isaki keemat zyada he
 Minister of Food and Civil Supplies
 es
 After Bali did not give a clear answer to the opposition's questions, Chief Minister Singh intervened in it
 rajya main cement utpaadan ke liye chaar mega plant lage hue he, jinamein baramana sthit asisi, daralaghat sthit ambuja, rajban sthit sisiai or bagha sthit aippy himachal cement limited companiyaan shaamil hai
 Their annual cement production capacity is more than 10 million tonnes
 modi sarkaar kaa pehla sansadeey satr sarkari kaamkaaj ke hisaab se kaaphi ahm rahaa he
 After coming to power for the second time in a row, in its very first session, the Opposition did not have any opposition in front of the government and many stuck bills were passed
 is baar bijepi 303 saansadon ke saath loksabhaa main pahunchi thi, jahaan endie ke saansadon ko milakar 353 saansad sarkaar ke saath hai
 At the same time, the main opposition Congress failed to mobilize its allies
 prachand bahumat vaali 17veen loksabhaa main khub kaamkaaj hua or jammu kashmir punargathan, teen talaak, motor whical, enie sanshodhan jaise atake pade vidheyak bhi ek jatke main kanoon ban gaye
 These Bills were discussed in the House, debate was also held but the Government did not accept the demands made by the opposition parties
 congress or tiemasi samet vipakshi dal vidheyakon ko sansadeey samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang par ade the lekin kisi bhi bill ko jaanch-padtaal ke liye samiti ke paas nahin bheja gaya
 a lot of work was not done, the Speaker said that this session was a golden session and there was no interference in the House this time, it is a record in itself
 pehle satr main loksabhaa kii kaarywahi puure satr ek bhi baar hangaame kii vajah se sthagit nahin hui
 Also, 36 bills were passed from the Lok Sabha and the House proceeded to discuss various issues for 280 hours
 kai maukey to aise aae jab raat 12 baje tak loksabhaa main charchaa chalati rahi
 Also, the Lok Sabha worked for seven and a half hours on an average every day
 saal 1952 main pehali loksabhaa ke pehle satr main 25 vidheyakon ko paas kiya gaya tha
 But this time in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, 36 bills have been passed
 pichhali loksabhaa samet 11veen, 14veen or 15veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main koi bhi bill sadan se paarit nahin ho sakaa tha
 Most of the mps elected for the first time in this Lok Sabha were given an opportunity to speak in the first session during the Question Hour or Zero Hour
 loksabhaa spikar om birla ne sadan main saaf kar diya tha ki pehle jo hota aayaa he vah ab nahin hoga
 He had said that this house would not be adjourned because of the uproar
 sadan ko sucharu dhang se chalaane main spikar kii madad sarkaar ko mili baari bahumat ne to kii hi, saath main baraabar apni baat kehane kaa mauka paakar vipaksh bhi spikar kii baat se sahamat hokar sadan kii kaarywahi chalaane main sahyog kar rahaa
 bjp's agenda to run in the country? This time the Modi government has got the approval of Parliament to such bills which have been bjp's agenda for a long time
 inamen sabase ahm jammu kashmir punargathan bill he jo kashmir ko 2 hisson main baantta he
 The removal of Article 370 from Kashmir from the Jana Sangh has been the main agenda of the BJP
 is baar sarkaar ne yah sankalp bhi sadan se paas kara liya
 Now Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh will be two separate union territories, along with the withdrawal of 370 from Kashmir, many laws and constitutional amendments will come into force there
 teen talaak bill kii vakaalat bijepi 2014 main satta paane se pehle hi karti ai he
 The bill was last stopped in the Rajya Sabha after it was passed by the Lok Sabha
 lekin is baar donon sadanon se yah bill paas hua
 Now, triple talaq is illegal in the country and a crime has been made by adding a provision of 3 years of punishment aage or bhi mukaam
 
 
 The government has played such a stakes in the Lok Sabha that now it has intensified to pass the uniform civil code of bjp's agenda from Parliament and the laws related to construction of Ram temple
 ek desh, ek vidhaan or ek pradhan ke naare par chalani vaali bijepi aane vaale dinon main desh main samaan nagirak samhita ko bhi sansad se paarit kara sakati he or is baar ke sanket bijepi ke aalaa netaa bhi de chuke hai
 It is not difficult to guess the way ahead from the beginning of the session of Modi government
 prachand bahumat ke bal par bijepi un sabhi kanoonon ko paarit karaane kii koshish karegi jo party kii vichaardhaara kaa ahm hissaa hai
 Though the opposition continued to accuse the government of imposing bills and insulting the Parliament throughout the session, the numbers are not in its favor for the next 5 years

 is dauraan unke saath tiidi ke pramukh kris anderson, star india (hindi antertenment) ke adhyaksh gaurav banerjee or star india ke prabandh nideshak sanjay gupta bhi maujuud the
 It was mentioned in the recent media report that Shah Rukh Khan can be seen in Yash Raj Films' Dhoom 4
 ek anya afvaah ye thi ki abhinayta quentin taranatinos ke 'kil bill' ke hindi rimek main abhinay karne vaale hai
 At the same time, another report said that Shah Rukh was engaged in preparing for 'don 3'

 Just before the introduction of anti-rape bill in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, where the all-party meeting was held on Monday morning on this issue, on Monday evening, the cabinet also met and discussed the anti-rape bill in detail
 mantrimandal kii baithak main sarkaar ne sahmati se yon sambandh banane kii nunatam umr ko badhaakar 18 varsh karne par apni manjuuri de di
 Sources gave this information on Monday
 ek samaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki vidheyak ke is praavdhaan kaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa tha
 After the consensus was reached on the age of consent in an all-party meeting, an official source said, "A consensual physical relationship with a girl under the age of 18 would be considered 'rape'"
 ’sutron ke anusaar yon aparaadh karne vaale naaballig bachche ko pehle aparaadh ke liye dand swaroop ek varsh kii probeshan se guzarana hoga, lekin duusari baar isi tarah kaa aparaadh karne par us par 'balaatkaar' kaa maamla darj kiya jayega
 Kavita Krishnan, president of All India Progressive Women's Association, said that this provision of the Criminal Law (amendment) Bill-2013 could have been misused
 kavita ne kaha, ‘sarvadaleey baithak main spasht taur par yah nirnay liya gaya ki sahmati kii umr 18 varsh hogi lekin kisi naaballig bachche dwaara sahmati se sambandh banaae jane par pehali baar use probeshan se guzarana hoga
 This is grossly inadequate in terms of security, as any third person such as their kin or khap panchayats can accuse them of violation of probation and get them convicted for the crime of 'rape'
 ’mahila adhikaron ke liye ladane vaali kavita ne kaha ki sahmati kii umr 18 varsh rahane die jane ke praavdhaan kaa anusuchit varg ke khilaaf istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, "relationship with consent at an age below the age of consent cannot be used for defense under judicial process
" agar ise 18 varsh kar diya jaataa he to navayuvakon, visheshkar anusuchit varg ke, ko sahmati se banaae gaye sambandhon ke liye bhi 'balaatkaar' kaa apradhi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 According to a Supreme Court lawyer, the controversy over the age of consent started in May last year when the age of consent in the Indian Penal Code was increased from 16 years to 18 years in the Protection of Child Sexual Offenses Act-2012
 vah kehete hai ki ab sarkaar ko koi ek antim nirnay le lenaa chahie
 Sources said that with the introduction of the bill in the Lok Sabha, the government will bring an amendment proposal on this issue
 vidheyak main 'balaatkaar' ke durlabhtam maamle main tathaa baar-baar kiye jane kii sthiti main mrityu kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya gaya he

 Jaggery crushers, considered to be the main cottage industries of western Uttar Pradesh, are facing a crisis
 ek to iskaa bazaar sikud rahaa he
 Secondly, due to increase in the number of sugar mills and their crushing capacity, the supply of sugarcane to the crushers has been reduced to 25 per cent, which has increased the risk to the industry
 kabhi is ilaake ke gud kii maang dur-dur tak hua karti thi
 There was tremendous consumption in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat
 lekin ab gujarat ke narmada nahar ilaake, chhattisgarh ke raipur or bilaspur kshetra main ganne kii paidaavaar or gud kaa utpaadan bade str par shuru ho jane se pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kutir udyog ko dhakka laga he
 Sugarcane production and production has started in Gwalior and Jabalpur divisions of Madhya Pradesh in recent years
 favderation of gud treders ke rashtriya adhyaksh arun khandelwal bataate hai, ''pashchimi uttar pradesh main ganne ke visheshgy kisaanon ne acchhee-khaasi taadaad main madhya pradesh kaa rukh kar jabalpur sambhag ke narsinghpur jile main ganne kii kheti ko pramukh rup se apana liya he or vahaan gud banane kii ikaiyaan sthapit kar di hai
 "with no sugar mills in the region, jaggery is being produced without any competition
" natijatan, pashchimi uttar pradesh main gud kaa kaarobaar prabhavit hone laga he
 Khandelwal states that farmers and jaggery manufacturers from Barla in Muzaffarnagar and Gopali and Rajupur villages of Deoband area of saharanpur in Poona district of Maharashtra have established 90 jaggery units there
 is badlaav kaa asar yah hua ki purvi bharat ke urisa, assam or pashchimi bengal vagairah ke jin praanton ko pashchimi uttar pradesh se gud kii aapurti hoti thi, ab vah buree tarah se prabhavit ho gai he
 Considered to be the most popular part of the Indian subcontinent's cuisine, jaggery is still produced in western Uttar Pradesh
 is kshetra ke samrudhshali jile mujffarnagar main asia kii sabase badi gud mandi sthit he
 Apart from sugarcane growers, five lakh people are directly connected with the jaggery business here
 1990 main ganna utpaadan kaa 23 fisadi hissaa chini milon, 13 fisadi khandsari, 10 fisadi beej or ras main istemaal hota tha or baaki 54-55 fisadi hissaa kolhuon par gud banane main istemaal hota tha
 The condition now is that the Khandasari industry has completely come to an end and due to the tremendous increase in the number of sugar mills and their crushing capacity, a large part of the sugarcane has gone to the sugar industry
 is samay chini udyog ko kul ganna utpaadan kaa 60 se 65 fisadi hissaa mil rahaa he, jabaki gud ikaayiyon ko isaki aapurti bahut ghat gai he
 But when the prices of jaggery rise in the market, the supply of sugarcane to sugar mills and their crushing is severely hampered
 kolhu maalik ganna mulya ke maamle main chini milon ko kadi takkar dene lagate hai
 Sugarcane prices are often higher than sugar mills on crushers
 aisi haalat main chini milon kii ganna supplai prabhavit hoti he or us dauraan 30-40 fisadi ganna kolhuon ko jane lagata he
 In the districts of Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar, which produce the highest sugarcane in western Uttar Pradesh, sugarcane reaches 40–45 per cent of the crusher while in other places it is 25–30 per cent
 baharhaal, jab se kolhuon kii chini milon se pratidwandvita shuru hui he, unhone laabh kamaane ke nayab tareeke dhundh nikaale hai
 For example, they have stopped using bagasse as fuel
 ve use paper milon ko oonche daamon par bech dete hai
 And in the crusher, polythene wastes have been used as alternative fuels, peasants of poplar and eucalyptus have been used
 isse ve aarthik rup se to majboot hote hi hai, unke tikaaupan kii kshamta bhi bad jaati he
 In such condition, sometimes they are in a condition to give more sugarcane prices to the farmers than the sugar mills
 triveni sugar group ke adhyaksh ejeeniyar anil tanvar kehete hai, ''vakt ke saath-saath kolhu sanchaalak samajhadaar hote ja rahe hai
 The government also gets some revenue from jaggery
 rajya main gud ke utpaadan par dhai fisadi mandi shulk lagata he jabaki bihar or dilli jaise rajyon main is par koi shulk nahin he
 In other states, there is only one to one and a half per cent mandi duty on jaggery
 bakaul khandelwal, ''vyapak janhit main mukhyamantri mayawati ko chahie ki ve gud par se mandi shulk puri tarah se samaapt kar den
 Otherwise, reduce it to one percent
 ''isse gud kii kalabazari par to ankush lagegaa hi, saath hi, uske kaarobaar par mandaraane vaale sankat ke badal bhi kuch kam honge
 This week the stock market has seen a lot of ups and downs
 lekin shuukravaar ko isamen bahut badi giravat dekhne ko mili

 vahiin,niftimein bhi jabardast giravat dekhne ko mili
 This too came down to 11 thousand
 haalanki abhi bazaar ne sambhalanaa shuru kar diya he
 The market has seen a significant drop in shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) and Aus Bank after starting with gains in the morning
 dchaefeel ke difolt hone kii afvaah udne ke baad company ke share 56 fisadi tak gir gaye

 abhi bisai par 494 companiyon ke share hare nishaan ke upar kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 2,130 shares declined
 135 shairo main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Why there is a downward trend: a sharp drop in realty shares is responsible for this sudden drop in the stock market
 dewan houseing ke share 50 fisadi tuutane ke baad bazaar main bikwaali bad gai
 Its effect was seen in the most realty shares
 isse anya rielity companiyon ke sheyaron main bhi giravat badhati chali gai
 Indiabulls shares were down by 30 per cent
 grih finance 15 fisadi, elisi finance limited 15 fisadi or alendty houseing finance limilated ke share 12 fisadi dhadaam hue
 Yes Bank's shares are therefore down: Reserve Bank of India has extended it till January 31, 2019 instead of Yes Bank chief Rana Kapoor's term for three years
 is khabar ke baad bank ke sheyaron main lagaataar giravat kaa daur jari he

 Sai is respected by his devotees, but do you know who Sai really is
 kabhi sochaa he kyon lagaataar badhati ja rahi he inke bhakton kii qatari
 What is it in Sai that whoever goes to Shirdi, he remains the same through Sai
 aakhir kya he sai naam kii mahima
 Let us know the glory of Sai Baba and his words
 
 
 sai baba or unki mahima:-sai babako ek chamatkaari purush, avatar or bhagwaan kaa swarup mana jaataa he
 - They are considered a symbol of devotional tradition
 - sai baba kaa janm or unase judi duusari chijen abhi agyaat hai
 - Their original place is Shirdi in Maharashtra, where devotees go to visit their place
 - sai ko har dharm main manyata praapt he, har dharm ke maanane vaale sai main aasthaa rakhte hai
 - Sai is worshiped specially on Thursday
 - mukhyataur par teen roopon main kii jaati he sai kii upasna
 - As a miraculous man, as a god and as a guru
 - guru ke rup main inaki puja upasna sabase uttam hoti he
 Life and teachings of Sai Baba: - Sai Baba usually did not give any worship method or life philosophy
 - ek hi ishwar or shraddha-saburi par hi unka vishesh jor rahaa he
 - But his eleven words are his philosophy to his devotees
 - in gyaarah vachanon main jivan kii har samasya kaa samaadhaan chupa hua he
 - These eleven words are actually eleven boons of Sai Baba
 - ye vachan apane aap main aadhyatm kii badi shikshaayen samete hue hai
 Sayin Baba's eleven words and their meanings- First word: 'he who comes to Shirdi will be overcome
 '- sai baba kii lila sthali shiridy rahi he
 Therefore, Sai says that mere arrival of Shirdi will avert problems
 jo log shiridy nahin ja sakate unke liye sai mandir janaa bhi paryaapt hoga
 The second word: 'climb the ladder of samadhi, the generation of sorrow under foot
 '- sai baba kii samadhi kii seedhi par pair rakhte hi bhakt ke dukh dur ho jaaenge
 Visions of symbolic samadhi in Sai temples also remove sorrows, but it is important to have reverence in mind
 teesraa vachan:'tyaag sharir chalaa jaaoongaa, bhakt hetu dauda aauungaa
 '- Sai Baba says that even if i do not live in the body
 lekin jab bhi meraa bhakt mujhe pukaaregaa, main daud ke aauungaa or har prakaar se apane bhakt kii sahaayta karuunga
 Fourth word: 'keep in mind, firmly believe, make samadhi complete
 '- ho saktaa he mere na rahane par bhakt kaa vishwaas kamjor padane lage
 He started feeling lonely and helpless
 lekin bhakt ko vishwaas rakhana chahie ki samadhi se kii gai har prarthana purna hogi
 Fifth Word: 'know me always alive, feel the truth
 '- sai baba kehete hai ki main keval sharir nahin hum
 i am the eternal-immortal God, so i will always live
 yah baat bhakthi or prem se koi bhi bhakt anubhav kar saktaa he
 Sixth Word: 'if my refuge is empty, let someone tell me
 '- jo koi bhi vyakti sachhee shraddha se meri sharan main aayaa he
 His every wish has been fulfilled
 saatvaan vachan:'jaisaa bhav rahaa jis jan kaa, vaisaa rup hua mere man kaa
 '- The person who looks at me, i look the same
 yahi nahin jis bhav se kaamana karata he, usee bhav se main uski kaamana purna karata hum
 Eighth promise: 'your weight will be on me, neither my promise will be false
 '- jo vyakti purna rup se samarpit hoga uske jivan ke har bhaar ko uthaaungaa
 And i will discharge all its obligations
 nauvaan vachan:'aa sahaayta lo bharpoor, jo maanga wo nahin he dur
 '- i will definitely help the devotee who seeks help with reverence
 dasvaan vachan:'mujhamen leen vachan man kaaya , uskaa rin na kabhi chukaaya
 '- i am forever indebted to a devotee who is engrossed in me with mind, words and deeds
 us bhakt ke jivan kii sari jimmedaari meri he
 Eleventh Word: 'blessed are the blessed and devoted devotees, my refuge is none other
 '- sai baba kehete hai ki mere wo bhakt dhanya hai jo anany bhav se meri bhakthi main leen hai
 Such devotees are actually devotees
 kaise karensain baba ke in gyaarah vachanon kaa jivan main prayog ?- kisi bhibrihaspativarako in vachanon ko pile kaagaj par laal kalam se likh len
 - Put these words in your place of worship, bedroom and working place
 - puja ke pehle, sone se pehle, kaam karne ke pehle or sokar uthne ke baad in vachanon ko padhein
 - After reading these, remember Sai Baba, you will definitely get the blessings of Sai Baba
