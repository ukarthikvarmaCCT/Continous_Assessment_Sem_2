 news channelon par patrakaron ko sant rampal ke ashram se reporting karte hue dekhnaa har kisi ko acha lag rahaa hoga, lekin halaat itane aasaan nahin hai
 There are several police checkposts from Hisar to Barwala
 aakhri checkpost ashram se teen kilometre dur he
 Everyday we wake up between 4-5 am
 apana ai-card dikhaate hue aakhri checkpost tak pahunchate hai
 After this neither one can go on his own nor can anyone go
 police se lard-jhagadkar ham bairicade ke aage nikalate hai
 Once inside, then inside for the whole day, because again the police do not let them go inside
 bade-bade bag main apane shoot kaa saamaan laade ham or hamaare saathi aage kaa rasta paidal tay karte hai
 There is neither something to eat nor anything to drink, because we go out in the morning, so we do not even get food
 ham log apane saath jo thodaa bahut biscuit or namakeen le jate hai, usee se puure din kaa kaam chalata he
 Or if someone gets a chance to bring some food from anywhere in the middle, then all journalists eat together
 vaise baba ke ashram vaale chaay or biscuit baar-baar dene kii koshish karte hai, lekin yahaan chaay koi patrkaar nahin peetaa, kyonki unhen pataa he ki baba ko doodh se nahalaane ke baad usee doodh se yahaan chaay banati he
 Therefore, everyone feels that the water that Baba's people are drinking may not have the same story
 puure din baba rampal ke logon se nokajhonk bhi hoti he
 They want us to run the news accordingly, we also have to report sparingly with a fierce crowd of thousands
 kai baar baba ke log patrakaron ko khabar ke liye dhamkaate hai
 Seeing the situation here, it would say that Baba's people are like commando suicide bombers, who are ready to die even in such a harsh situation
 ashram kaa bijli-pani kataa hua he, isliye kai log kai dinon se nahaye nahin hai
 It is automatically realized when standing nearby
 koi baba rampal ko majaak ke daur par rumpal kahata he to koi barwaala ko bagdadi
 Amidst the joke, if the police suddenly comes into action, then we also start our work
 kai baar bheed police ko khadedti he to ham bhi kheton kii ore bhaagate hai, kyonki yahaan kii police kii laathiyon se zyada khatra baba rampal ke logon se he, jo hathiyaaron ke saath taiyaar hai
 We have limited resources to charge phone or camera batteries and in that we have to spend time till late night
 yahaan adhiktar sthaneey log baba kii khilaaf hai, lekin police unhen najadik bhatakane bhi nahin detii
 After reporting, we proceed to our hotel late at night and leave again in the morning, towards this unique Baba's ashram

 i wonder whether providing such a facility to other passengers especially women in a moving vehicle would seem to conform to the standards of Indian culture? There does not seem to be any justification for such levelless arrangements in place of many other necessary facilities like medical facilities, availability of doctors etc
 aashaa he aap is maamle main janamanas kii bhaawanaaon par yogya vichaar kar uchit nirnay lenge'
 Actually, the railways had decided to introduce head and foot massages of passengers in the moving train

 Still the saint kept smiling
 sant par jab koi asar nahin hua to vah vyakti niraash hokar raste se hat gaya
 As soon as that person left, a follower asked the saint why you did not answer the words of that wicked one, he kept speaking and you kept smiling
 kya aapako uski baton se jaraa bhi ksht nahin hua? sant kuch nahin bole or apane anuyaayi ko peeche aane kaa ishaara kiya
 After some time he along with the saint reached the follower room
 sant bole, ‘tum yaheen ruko main andar se abhi aata hum
 After some time, the saints came out of their room, they had some dirty clothes in their hands
 unhone baahar aakar us anuyaayi se kaha, ‘ye lo, tum apane kapade utarkar inhen dhaaran kar lo
 'know who is Lingayat, why do you want to be different from Hinduism? The follower noticed that those clothes have very bad odor, it had a strange smell
 anuyaayi ne un kapadon ko haath main lete hi un kapadon ko dur phenk diya
 The saint said, 'now understand? When someone says good and bad without meaning to you
 tum krodhit hokar uske phenke hue apshabd dhaaran kar lete ho, lekin duusare ke gande kapade nahin pahan sakate
 Just as you cannot wear these dirty clothes in place of your clean clothes, similarly i also did not wear the abusive words of that man

 IAS officer Mohammad Mohsin of Karnataka cadre checked Prime Minister Modi's helicopter
 achaanak hui is checking ke kaaran pradhanmantri ke udne main 15 minute kii deree ho gai
 The Election Commission suspended Mohammed Mohsin and said that he did not work as per the process of investigating the people who were under the security cover of the Special Protection Group
 mohammad mohsin 1996 batch ke adhikari hai
 It has been written in the order that Mohammad Mohsin has not acted in accordance with the orders of the Election Commission of 22 March 2019 and 10 April 2014 regarding SPC
 vibhinn niyamon kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he ki chunaav ayog is adhikari ko nilambit karata he

 hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar ne jab ayog se poocha ki kis aadhaar par pradhanmantri kaa helicopter check karne ke kaaran iees afasar ko suspend kiya gaya he to ayog ne 10 april 2014 ke aadesh kaa hawala diya ki espiji kii suraksha waalon kii checking nahin hogi
 Our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar says that he has read the order of April 10, 2014 carefully
 10 april 2014 ke aadesh main yah zarur likhaa he ki chunaav abhiyaan yaa chunaav se sambandhit kisi bhi kaam main sarkari vaahanon kaa istamaal puri tarah pratibandhit he
 But the Prime Minister and other political figures are exempted from using government vehicles
 kyonki inhen aatanki or charampanthi gatividhiyon se khatara hota he or ucch stareey suraksha kii zarurat hoti he
 Whose protection is protected by constitutional provisions made by Parliament or Vidhan Sabha
 to yah baat saaf ho jaati he ki 10 april 2014 kaa aadesh yah kahin nahin kahata he ki espiji suraksha ghere main vyakti ke sarkari helicopter kii talaashi nahin lee ja sakati he
 Arvind says that the rules cited by the Election Commission do not exist on paper
 to kya mohammad mohsin ko apni duty karne kii sazaa di gai he, kya ye sazaa isliye di gai he ki unhone pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi le lee
 The problem is that journalists no longer read the details
 hindi akhabaaron main to bhul hi jaaiye ki kuch chhapega bhi
 You know the state of the channel
 arvind gunashekhar ne un aadesh patron ko padhaa he jise chunaav ayog ne diya he
 And when read, it is learned that it is not written that as SPG security, the Prime Minister's helicopter will not be searched
 ab main 10 april 2014 ke aadesh kaa ek or hissaa padhanaa chahta hum
 Please read it carefully
 isamen likhaa he ki agar kabhi is baat ko lekar zaraa bhi andeh ho ki espiji act yaa anya vishesh praavdhaanon ke tahat athurity ne suraksha kaa moolyankan badha chadha kar is tarah se kiya he ki un vaahanon se kisi party yaa ummidavaar ke paksh main chunavi hiton ko prabhavit kiya ja sake to ayog is maamle ko sambandhit sarkaar kii nazar main laaegaa taaki uchit kadam uthaaya ja sake
 The concerned government means that many times even the Chief Minister can be in the SPG security circle, then the State Government will be written to review or evaluate whether the SPG vehicle is necessary or not
 is cese main grahamantralay ko likhaa ja saktaa tha
 We have not translated the Election Commission order into Hindi literally
 kahin kahin bhav kaa bhi kiya he
 All this hard work is done by our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar, which i am presenting
 arvind ko hindi nahin aati or mujhe angrezi nahin aati
 But what is right, it does not stop in the name of language
 arvind ne bataaya he ki 14 july 1999 kaa ek aadesh he chunaav ayog kaa
 It states that no government aircraft or helicopters have been exempted from the search
 to kya chunaav ayog ne ek aise praavdhaan ke sahare mohammad mohsin ko nilambit kiya he jo praavdhaan he hi nahin
 Arvind is stating that the Election Commission is referring to the order of April 10, 2014, it is not written that the helicopter of the SPG security person will not be investigated
 arvind ne bataaya ki chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ne gandhi parivaar ke helicopter kii bhi talaashi lee he
 This is tweeted by Ahmed Patel
 chunaav ayog ke sutron ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri rahete manmohan singh kaa bhi search hua he
 Now there is one more question
 chunaav ayog ne yah ection kiski shikaayat par kiya he
 The complainant is not mentioned in the order of suspension of Election Commission
 yah bhi nahin likhaa he ki odisha ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari chif elactoral afisar ne shikaayat bheji he, report bheji he
 So did the Election Commission take action on its own, why is it not in the public copy of its order? chunaav ayog ne 22 march 2019 ke order kaa hawala diya he magar isamen bhi yahi likhaa he kicommercial airport par checking ke sambandh main All the rules and procedures related to the investigation and search of person and goods should be strictly followed during the election process
 isamen kisi ko chhot nahin milani chahie
 All passengers and their belongings, except those who are exempted, will be examined before boarding the aircraft or before entering the airport
 is aadesh main kahin nahin likhaa he ki espiji protection hasil vyakti ko chhot he
 Another matter related to the order of 22 March 2019 Commercial Airport

 In the press conference of the Election Commission, the question arose as to who complained to the Commission, the Commission said that information was received from the Field Officer and the Chief Election Executive of Odisha
 chunaav ayog ne nilamban kar diya he lekin ab ek adhikari ko maukey par bheja ja rahaa he jaanch ke liye
 Should not have been sent earlier then the action is taken

 So far no decision has been taken on the statement of the Prime Minister
 chunaav ayog ko bataanaa chahie ki deree kyon ho rahi he, kya vah pradhanmantri ke maamle main ection lene main usee tarah se tatpar or nishpaksh nazar aa rahaa he, yah sawaal puche jane kaa vakt he
 Today when you were asked in the press conference of the Commission, what action was taken on the statement of Latur, you will be surprised
 ayog ne jawaab diya ki shuru main unke bhaashan kaa ek para aayaa tha
 Now the copy of the certified speech has arrived and investigation is being done
 chunaav ayog kaa yah jawaab he
 On 9 April, the Prime Minister gave a speech in Latur
 18 april he
 The Commission has not been able to take action in 9 days
 jab patrakaron ne poocha ki wo aadesh kahaan he jisamen ye likhaa he ki espiji surakshit pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi nahin hogi to yahi jawaab mila ki ham check karenge or aapako bataaenge
 Governor Kalyan Singh was recommended to the President to take action, as of now there is no information
 ye saare sawaal hindi akhabaaron se gaayab kiye ja rahe hai taaki janata andhere main rahe

 chaay kii dukaan main oxigen silendar jaisaa paatr dekh meri nazar thahar gai
 Shopkeeper Rajesh Shukla told that this is the system of the British
 wo chale gaye lekin chaay pine kaa ye style bharat main rah gaya
 The British did not drink milk tea
 likar ( sirf pattee vaali chaay) hi pite the
 Boiling water in the cylinder
 "neeche lage nalke se jab pani nikalataa he to ham pattee vaali glass neeche rakh dete hai
 a sieve inside the glass on which the leaf is placed
 garam pani kaa rang badal jaataa he 
 "" But the Indian people don't like liquor that much
 " teen- teen pidiyon se chaay bechney kii thasak ne rajesh shukla ko chaay kaa samajashastri bana diya he
 It has been more than 100 years
 shukla kehete hai ki mujhe likar chaay banane kii hi aadat he
 According to the test of now
 
 
 
 First i make liqueur, then milk and sugar are added to it and then let it boil for a while
 shukla kii dukaan par bahut bheed hoti he
 The good thing is that they use clay cups (chukkad)
 bengal main chaay kaa str desh ke kisi bhi hisse se behatar he
 Here, like Delhi or other parts, water, milk and leaf are not boiled simultaneously on the stove for hours
 dilli ke logon ne tej or kadak chaay ke naam par chaay pine kii aadat bigaad lee he
 By the way, in the case of tea made by boiling, Bengal can also compete with Delhi
 shaayad kolkata main aupniveshik chhap gahari rahi hogi tabhi yahan rikhshavala se lekar machhlee bechney vaala likar chaay peetaa hua nazar aata he
 Drink plenty of lemon tea too
 jabaki uttar bharat ke log likar chaay ko ofisar yaa collector chaay samajhate hai
 Kolkata also has more open tea shops than Delhi
 in dinon dilli kaa apper-middle class tashan se green tii pi rahaa he kolkata kaa loar- class kab se aisi chaay pi rahaa he 
 There is another difference
 bengal kii chaay dukaanon main chaay banane kii vidhi main khub vividhta dikhegi
 In both workmanship and art
 dilli kii sadakon par kahin chalo jaaiye ek hi tareeke se chaay banate dikhegi 
 i like this tea shop in Vijaygarh area
 mag ke neeche channi lagi he
 a leaf is placed on it
 dukandaar khaulate pani ko is mag se paas karaata he
 The leaf leaves its color and taste when exposed to hot water
 ise duusari kettle main jamaa kar liya jaataa he
 Preheated milk is placed in the glass in which leaf water is poured
 chaay taiyaar 
 Milk tea also tastes like liqueur
 bina doodh vaali likar chaay kii vidhi bhi aasaan he
 The first shopkeeper passed the boiling water over the leaves placed on the sieve containing the mug
 mag ke neeche ek bada mag rakhaa hota he jisamen is pani ko roak liya jaataa he
 Now it becomes a solution in a way which is poured into the glass according to three teaspoons
 isamen alag se khaulate pani ko daalaa jaataa he
 Sugar is mixed separately
 bada bazaar main chaay banane kii is technology ko dekhiye
 It has even left Delhi behind in terms of boiling
 baqayada chuulhe ke neeche ek banda bithaaya gaya he jo lagaataar is desi mashin se hawa paidaa kar rahaa he
 The air coming out of the machine's bottle keeps the stove high and the tea continues to soar above that the poor leaves will burn away
 swaad kaa to pataa hi nahin chalata hoga
 But the flavors of this taste are also enough

 Comparatively, between 1971 and 2017, the total population of the country has increased by nearly two and a half times in the 46 years, but the votes of the delegates who voted in the presidential election are being determined only on the basis of 1971 census data
 a few days later the presidential elections are also to be held on the basis of the census data of 46 years old

 After this, the 1971 census became the basis of the presidential elections held in the 70s
 ’ He said that after this, the constituencies of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha constituencies were delimited on the basis of 1971 census and till 2004 all general and assembly elections were held on the same limit
 is dauraan raashtrapati chunaav bhi 1971 kii janaganana ke anusaar hi hote rahe

 It is noteworthy that after this, in 2002, the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Bajpai at the Center amended the constitution and decided that all the presidential elections till 2026 will be held according to the 1971 census

 haalanki unka maananaa he ki jo taarikh is baar marathon ke liye tay kii gai he vah badhate pradooshan ko dekhte hue ekadam sahi he kyonki november or disambar ke maheene main aasapaas ke rajyon se fasalon ke jalane par jis tarah kaa pradooshan dilli kii taraf aata he vah oktober ke maheene main kab hoga iske saath hi diwali ke pataakhe or dilli kaa apana pradooshan november disambar ke maheene main kai guna bad jaataa he isi ko dekhte hue yah taarikh sahi rahegi
 However, he also says that in this season, health freaks like him also skip morning walks and workouts and exercise at home
 anik kii tarah hi noida ke tarun vadhava bhi badhate pradooshan ke chalate subah kii saiyr or vyaayaam ko sardiyon main kuch maheenon ke liye band kar dete hai

 The exercise that is needed for the half marathon is very important in the open air exercise in the morning and evening, which he is not able to do now and he says that the government should take some concrete steps on this issue as soon as possible
 dilli main badhate pradooshan kii gambhir samasya ko pehle bhi kai baar paryaavarnavid vimal indu uthaate rahe hai
 He says that for the complete resolution of this problem, concrete steps are needed from the government soon
 aasapaas ke rajyon main jis tarah se fasalon ko jalaayaa jaataa he or dilli main sadakon par daudane vaali gadiyon kii badhati samasya dilli ensiaar main har din badhati factriyaan or bhi kai tarah kii samasyaayein hai jin par sarkaar ko thos kadam uthaane chahie jisase koi kancreet nattejey nikaale ja sake
 Increasing pollution has hurt the crops considerably for people participating in the half marathon

 If the situation remains the same, then the people who run the marathon in the coming time will be equal

 a professor of anatomy at a medical college asked the students the intriguing question: Which organ of the human body can grow many times its size in excitement? The whole class waited patiently
 tabhi professor ne ek chaatra se jawaab dene ko kaha
 The student's face turned red with shame
 usne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki usase iskaa jawaab maangana jaij nahin he
 The professor smiled and said three things to the student: she had not read his notes, she had a mess in her mind, and she might have to face disappointment when she got married

 At the same time, in the extreme zeal like Jain hawala case, the Supreme Court also took the responsibility of bringing back the black money of Arabs, or who knows, trillions (ask Baba Ramdev)
 lekin kisi ne bhi pehle buniyadi baton kii tasdik nahin kii, yaa kaale dhan kii maatra ke daavon ko buniyadi auchity kii kasuti par nahin parkhaa

 This is the reason why revealing all these names without proving blame would be inappropriate

 Similarly, the Opposition exaggerates allegations of corruption and incompetence against the incumbents

 Black money is just a matter of the shame the government is facing as a result of these ridiculous allegations

 But was fraud in every allocation? Was the loss in the millions of crores that the CAG had fabricated and told due to some of its lax attitude? Because the NDA, especially the BJP, had jumped up to take the maximum amount figure
 nateeja yah hua ki jab maamla supreme court main tha tab sarkaar ke naate ‘kolgate’ par kuch karne kii uske paas jaraa bhi gunjaaish nahin thi
 All allocations after 1993 were canceled and she remained helpless

 com / sivol8qidz Since repealing Article 370, the Modi government and the Indian media have been under attack from Pakistani trolls
 padosi desh ke soshal media yugers ek baar phir purana farji video share kar rahe hai jisamen 14 farvari ko pulavama hamale ke liye pradhanmantri modi ko mastermind bataaya gaya tha
 a video of Pakistan's youtube user Doctor Turkey is once again appearing on social media claiming that he has recorded the call of Prime Minister Modi after Pulwama
 ye video kareeb 5 maheene purana he
 The India Today anti-fake News War Room found the claim to be false and baseless
 daawey ke peeche kii sachai3 march ko post kiye gaye is video ko ab tak 39000 se zyada baar share kiya ja chukaa he
 You can watch this video archive here
 pakistani you tub yujar ne ek fasebuk yujar avi dandiya kaa ek purana farji video saboot ke taur par pesh kiya
 The story was proved to be fake by many factmakers including several India Today
 avi dandiya ne apane video main jis aawaaj kaa istemaal kiya tha wo farji thi
 What is in the video? In the 11 minute long video of Doctor Turkey, he is spewing venom against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 uskaa daawa he ki piem modi kaa ek audio li hua he jisase ye sabit hota he ki pulavama hamale ke peeche pradhanmantri modi the
 He then plays a video of Avi Dandiya spreading fake news on Facebook and appeals to people to listen to him
 wo aawaaj ek mahila or do kendriya mantriyon ke bich kii he
 Hearing this, it seems that their intention is to provoke patriotism by attacking the Indian army
 iske baad pakistani utyub yugers bhartiya media kii farji tasviir chalata he or use pulavama kaa mastermind batata he
 He also plays a video of Pakistani commander Wing Commander Abhinandan and appeals to the Indian people to remove Prime Minister Modi from power
 AFWA had revealed the forgery
 On 1 March 2019, Avi Dandia posted a video on Facebook claiming It was that two BJP ministers talked to a woman
 baad main ye daawa farji sabit hua , fact check karne vaale jaisenalt newsoraimdiya tudene ise galat sabit kiya tha
 The conversation was created by combining several interviews of the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh and BJP President Amit Shah
 pakistan ke utubar ne dandiya ke farji video kaa kuch hissaa uthaaya or daawa kiya ki ye pradhanmantri modi kii aawaaj he
 Dandia claims to be an NRI and her 2 on Facebook
 8 lakh folover hai
 Doctor Turkey Who is Pakistan's youtube user 'doctor Turki' youtube and Facebook has a large number of fans
 wo 2017 se utyub channel chalaata he or usko kareeb 5 lakh log follow karte hai
 This channel he runs from Saudi Arabia and most of his videos are anti-modi and anti-india
 nishkarshadoctor turki kaa daawa bhraamak he or usne apane daawey ko sabit karne ke liye ek or farji video kaa istemaal kiya he
 However, he has said one thing right when the Indian media called the picture of a foreign soldier as the mastermind of Pulwama
 kai media sansthaanon ne us vakt ye photo istemaal kii thi lekin baad main isko thik kar liya gaya tha

 Excerpts: On September 5, 2012, you told us how you tried to stop the coal scam
 aap sansad kii lok lekha samiti ko sab kuch bataane ko taiyaar the
 Is this still true today? The Public Accounts Committee of Parliament did not call me for testimony
 agar ve vaaki sach jaananaa chaahate the, to unhen pehle mujhe bulaanaa chahie tha, kyonki maine khuli boli kii pahal kii thi
 i did not tell the media anything because i am writing my memoirs
 isamen teen yaa chaar maheene or lagenge
 i will narrate the whole story in it
 yakeenan aap kuch or bataa sakate hai?pradhanmantri pakke taur par boli vyavastha shuru karne ke paksh main the
 i guess he probably did not have the support of the party
 july, 2004 main aap boli kii file pradhanmantri karyaalay le gaye the
 Principal Secretary T
 ke
 a
 nair ne kuch takneekee sawaal uthaakar use lautaa diya tha
 Did the bureaucrats hinder the establishment of a transparent regulatory system? The process began with a meeting of all stakeholders on June 28, 2004
 maine apana vichaar rakhaa ki koyala block aavanton ke liye boli lagane kii prakriya behatar tarika he
 Even in the industry, i did not find much supporters
 mujhe lagata he ki logon ne sochaa ki jab muft mil saktaa he to paise kyon den? maine sochaa tha ki jab aavedakon kii sankhya bahut bad jaaegi to nishpaksh chayan karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 So i prepared the competitive bid and put it before the Prime Minister
 mantralay ke bare main apni pehali brifing ke dauraan maine unke saath is par charchaa kii
 They agreed with me
 maine koyala khan rashtriyakaran kanoon 1973 main kuch sanshodhan laakar kaam shuru kiya
 My assessment was that the system should be in place by the end of 2004
 isliye maine jaanch samiti ko roke rakhaa
 Then Shibu Soren again became the Minister of Coal and a Cabinet note was placed
 unhone kaha ki is samay isaki jarurat nahin he or us samay kii pranali jari rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 The competitive bidding process went on hold
 sorain ke istipha dene ke baad jab koyala mantralay phir pradhanmantri ke haath main aayaa to tay kiya gaya ki boli prakriya par kaam shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 i introduced a Cabinet note, suggesting some amendments to the Coal Mines Nationalization Act
 vidhi vibhaag ne ek chota-sa sanshodhan shaamil karne kaa suzav diya ki koyala block aavanton spardhaatmak boli se kiya jayega
 Another amendment was asked to make the relevant rules
 lekin pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa vichaar tha ki hamen praathamikta ke liye adhyadesh laane kii jarurat nahin he, balki sansad kii manjuuri leni chahie
 That was the first hurdle
 isse pataa laga ki spardhaatmak boli kii prakriya kisi tarah jaldi shuru nahin ho sakati
 After that Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao said that the state governments are against the new process
 tii
 K
 e
 Nair held a meeting with the Chief Secretaries of the states
 rajyon ko sirf aavedakon ke vivaran kii pushti tak simit jaankaree deni thi, jo nirnay lene main kaam aati he
 But the Prime Minister's Office said that the states had objected to the allocation process and this was included in the Cabinet note which was later put on hold by Desari Narayan Rao till i retire
 uske baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki unhone cabinet note is tippanee ke saath lautaa diya ki aavanton kii maujuuda prakriya jari rah sakati he
 After that it was proposed that this process should not be limited to coal only, but should also be applied to other minerals governed by the Mines and Mineral Development Regulation Act 1957
 is tarah boli prakriya kaa prastaav dafan ho gaya
 What happened when you made a second attempt to persuade the Prime Minister's Office before retiring in December 2005? Shibu Soren stopped some important files when he became the coal minister for the second time
 main unke paas gaya or bataaya ki mujhe lagata he ki filein jaan-boojhkar roki ja rahi hai
 He t
 ke
 a
 nair ke jariye yah maamla pradhanmantri tak pahunchaaya
 Nair told me this during a meeting a few days later
 lekin do saptaah baad sorain ne kaha ki ve mujhase asahmat hai isliye yah prastaav chhod diya jaae
 After that the files went to Narayan Rao
 ab exiar main aap ke naam shadyantr kaa aarope he to aap pradhanmantri ko kaise jawaab denge? aapkaa bachaav kya he?talabira-2 ek captive block he, jiske liye neveli lignite korporation (enelsi) or hindalco do vishwasaneey aavedak the
 Both sides had equal financial strength and technical expertise
 shuru main enelsi kii taraf thodaa jhukaav tha, jo mere apane mantralay kii company thi
 The inquiry committee decided in his favor and i supported him
 order jari karne se pehle kumaar mangalam birla ne apana paksh rakhaa or mujhase poocha ki unki company kaa daawa enelsi se kamatar kaise tha
 He stated that his claim was somewhat better than NLC, as his company was the first applicant
 unhone kaha ki ve enelsi ko aavanton par vivaad nahin kar rahe hai par hamen kyon nikaal diya? unhone yah bhi bataaya ki piesu hone ke naate enelsi ko kahin bhi koyala block mil saktaa he, jabaki nijee company ko sirf adhishuchet khandon ke liye avedan kaa adhikaar he
 i thought he had a point
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne bhi us par dobaaraa vichaar karne kaa prastaav bheja
 i saw logic in his talk
 maine enelsi or hindalco ke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki ve sanyukt udhyam kar len
 The Prime Minister approved it
 kisi faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karne kaa matlab kumaar mangalam birla ke saath sajeesh karnaa nahin he
 i take full responsibility for a fair decision
 pradhanmantri ne koyala mantri kii haisiyat se ise manjuuri di thi
 i do not see any mistake in this
 agar yah sajeesh he to isamen teen vyakti the—kumaar mangalam birla, koyala sachiv ke naate main or us samay koyala mantri ke naate pradhanmantri
 Describing a fair and rational decision as a conspiracy, CBI is putting the Prime Minister in the dock as a conspirator with Birla and me
 aapako lagata he ki bali kaa bakra talasha ja rahaa he?mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa ki mere saath yah sab karke congress ko kya milegaa
 i just think that they are unnecessarily putting the Prime Minister in the dock
 agar yah sajeesh he to ve is sajeesh main shaamil maane jaaenge
 This is beyond logic

 congress us bhavar se ab tak nahin nikal pai he jisamen uski kashti dub gai thi
 After the massive defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the party has done nothing except accuse the ruling party that it is trying to re-establish itself
 party main na to punargathan kii sugabugahat he or na hi ise phir se majboot karne kaa prayaas
 And because of this, now open rebellion is seen in two states
 purvottar rajya assam ke ek varisht mantri himant vishwa sarama ne vidroh kaa bigul baja diya he or apane pad se istipha de diya he
 He says that Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi should be removed immediately as he has failed
 unhone siem gogoi ko yaad dilaayaa tha ki chunaav main haar ke baad unhone istife kii peshkash kii thi or unhen istipha de dena chahie
 Not only this, Sarma also raised the lack of internal democracy in the party
 thik isi tarah apane mukhyamantri ke istife kii maang karte hue maharashtra ke mantri narayan rane ne cabinet se istipha de diya he
 His supporters also want that CM Prithviraj Chavan be removed and given this post
 pichley hafte hi unhone alaakaman ko apane iraade jataa die the or ab istipha de aae
 Actually, Rane hoped that the high command could replace Chavan and give him the chair of CM, but if he did not see anything like this, he has adopted this trick
 vaise bhi maharashtra main congress-ensipi gathbandhan kii jo durdasha hui he uske baad party main bhay kii sthiti he
 The leaders of the alliance are looking for a safe path and want to make the Chief Minister a scapegoat while all are equal partners in this defeat
 lekin party alaakaman he ki chup he or tamaasha dekh rahi he
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is understood to have rejected the Assam cm's demand to replace him, but he is silent about stopping the rebellion in the state unit
 aisa lagata nahin ki maharashtra ke bare main bhi vah kuch soch rahe hai
 Sonia Gandhi's old advisors are also sitting silently
 matlab he ki party ke paas na to koi fori plan he or na koi dirghakaalin ranneeti
 Elections are about to come in Maharashtra and the party is in trouble there
 aise main apana astitv bachaane ke liye jaruri he ki party kisi thos yojana ke tahat kaam kare
 But it does not appear to happen
 party sannaate kii mudra main he or uske paas modi lahar ko rokane ke liye na to rajaneta hai or na hi kaaryakarta
 It seems that the party is no longer out of the losing mentality
 aisa lagata he ki dedh sau saal se zyada puraani is party ke paas ab na to drushti he or na hi koi thos yojana
 Obviously, the time to come will be more painful for him

 People who have passed intermediate from Bihar in neighboring Nepal are not only seen with suspicion, but the government is treating them as terrorists
 pichley dinon nepal ke tarai ilaake main karyrat 10 jilon ke 36 doctoron ke saath nepal kii kendriya jaanch agency siibi ne kuch aisa hi kiya
 They were caught in police vans, such as big criminals or terrorists, from their workplaces such as government hospitals, private hospitals and clinics
 had to yah he ki aadha darjan mahila chikitsakon ke saath bhi aisa hi bartaav hua
 The doctors have strongly criticized the government's discriminatory policy opposing this arrest
 nepal medical association (eneme) ke adhyaksh anjani kumaar jha ne kaha, ''galati karne waalon par karrwai honi chahie, lekin ''aatanki style" main nahin
 "the NMA termed the entire incident as unfortunate, saying that the incident has raised questions on the credibility of Nepal Medical Council (NMC)
" certificate kaa satyaapan to enemasi bhi kar sakati thi
 If the certificates were found to be false, the license of these doctors should have been canceled before the arrest
 giraftaar 36 main se 35 doctoron ke paas enemasi se manyata praapt license hai
 NMC general secretary Mukti Ram Shrestha has issued an order for doctors of the country to get government certificates verified before practicing
 birganj main baari virodh pradarshan or imargency seva thap karne ke doctoron ke ultimatum ke baad bhi giraftaar doctoron kii rihaai nahin ho saki
 The CIB produced the 36 doctors arrested on 19 June in the Kathmandu court on charges of becoming doctors by presenting fake certificates of the Bihar Intermediate Council and doing medical work using the alleged fake certificates of the Medical Council
 jiske baad paanch din hiraasat main rakhkar jaanch karne kaa aadesh kathmandu kii jila adaalat ne siibi ko diya he
 These doctors were arrested by the CIB on June 17 by raiding together from 10 districts including Birganj, Chitwan, Janakpur, Viratnagar, Kathmandu
 sutron kii maane to siibi ne lagbhag 150 aise chikitsakon kii list bana rakhi he, jin par nakli certificate istemaal karne kaa andeshaa he
 Under this list, certificates of 900 MBBS doctors practicing in Nepal have been secretly examined who have studied intermediate from Bihar
 nepal siibi kaa daawa he ki bihar kii farji degree par embibies karke ye doctor nepal medical council se galat tareeke se license hasil kar naukari or practice kar rahe the

 lohani pehle birganj main espi the, jinke kaarykaal main madheshi nagarikon par kathith julm kiya gaya tha
 Even at the time of the earthquake, Lohani was hampered in the way of seeking Indian help
 haalanki lohani in aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kehete he ki oparation quack ko puraa karne main nepal medical council or hair secondary ajukeshan board kaa sahyog liya gaya he
 According to Nepali law experts, now cases will be transferred to the courts of the respective districts

 Voices of protest are being raised about the arrest of doctors, but on the basis of doubt, how appropriate is this type of behavior? purv pakistani captain injamaam ul haq ne rashtriya team ke australian coach dev watamor kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki unase jaise nattejey dene kii ummid thi, ve unhen dene main asafal rahe
 The comments injamaam ne kaha, ‘‘sach kahuun to jab dev aae the to unase kaaphi ummiden lagi thim
 i don't think he has been able to deliver the expected results
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘mukhya cheez he ki jab board ne videshi coach niyukt kiya tha to is par jor diya gaya tha ki vah hamaari team main sudhaar laaenge, lekin jab se vah aae hai aisa nahin hua he

 Inzamam said, "to be honest, when Dave came, there were a lot of expectations from him
 mujhe nahin lagata ki vah ummid ke anuroop parinaam de paae hai
 "the main thing is that when the board appointed the foreign coach, it was emphasized that he would improve our team, but it has not happened since he has come," he said
 ’’ Watmore was appointed Pakistan's head coach in March 2012, replacing former Test player Mohsin Khan, since then his performance with the team has been widely criticized

 Her mother and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi have come forward to defend her son Varun Gandhi, who was trapped in the case of making anti-muslim speeches
 unhone kaha ki congress apane virdohi karnaamon ko chhipaane ke liye yah sab hatkande apana rahi he
 Breaking his silence on the entire controversy, Maneka told a regional news channel that it has become the habit of the Congress to show such tapes to cover up anti-sikh exploits
 unhone kaha ki yah sab hatkande apnaane kii bajaay congress ko is baat ke liye sharminda hona chahie ki usne un logon ko chunavi tikat die hai jo us sikh virdohi dangon main shaamil rahe hai
 Apart from the cds of Varun's alleged anti-muslim speeches, the Congress has submitted another CD to the Election Commission which shows him allegedly speaking against the Sikhs
 menka ne kaha ki ayog ne bhi is tepe ko jaali bataa kar khaarij kar diya he or yah vaaki jaali he kyonki varun ne is tarah kii bate nahin kahi hai
 He said that Sikhism was created to protect Hindus and there is hardly any difference between a Sikh and a Hindu

 Now Nana has returned with its sequel
 film main naanaa pehle vaale hi sadhu agashe lagate hai
 Just like he used to be in 2004
 nanaaki ab umr 64 saal ho chuki he, lekin unki acting or body language aaj bhi pehle jaisi behtareen hi he
 But the new director and poor production quality has spoiled the film
 puri film main sirf naanaa or naanaa hi chhaae rahete hai
 His acting and dialogue delivery is amazing
 film kii kahani purv encounter specialist sadhu agashe ke saath shuru hoti he jo ritair life ji rahaa he
 But due to the circumstances and pressure, the monk has to come back to the force again
 phir vahi maar-dhaad, gangster or netaaon ke sambandh or phir vahi dushchakr
 Nana completely freezes in his role, and Gul Panag and Ashutosh Rana also support him well, but the weak story and the rough directions make the whole thing go away
 film puri tarah 1990 ke dashak kii yaad dilaati he, lekin aise daur main jab 'singhm' or 'dabang' jaisi filmein ban rahi hai, us daur main is tarah kii film bananaa diarector or produsar kii samaj par ungali uthaati he
 Because of which Nana's talent also appears to have gone

 If the film had paid more attention to spicy action and strong story than speech, then the matter would have been different
 film ko single screen theatre main pasand kiya ja saktaa he
 There is hardly any hope for a big success
 vaise bhi yah film puri tarah se naanaa ke chaahane waalon ke liye he

 naksaliyon ke paas jo levi kaa paisa jaataa he, use dekhte hue campan chalaaya gaya he
 Apart from terrorism, fake notes and black money, there have been many such cases in these cash-strapped areas of Chhattisgarh where Naxalites force themselves with villagers to exchange old notes with them or to be deposited in bank accounts
 isi ko dhyaan main prashasan ne ilaake main cashles tranjackson kii training shuru kii

 Khanpur Assembly has proved to be an impregnable fortress of the BJP for the last three elections
 2013 vidhansabha chunaav kaa parinamsaal 2013 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke narendra nagar ne congress ke sanjay gurjar ko 30956 vot se parajeet kiya

 Result of 2008 assembly elections: In the 2008 assembly elections, bjp's Anil Kumar defeated former Congress MLA Meenakshi Chandrawat by 4955 votes
 bijepi ke anil kumaar ko 63664 or congress kii minakshi chandravat ko 58709 vot mili thea
 For the first time in Parliament, the importance of numbers is coming to the notice of the NDA government
 bhale hi loksabhaa main bijepi ke paas 280 saansad hon, magar rajya sabha main mahaj 42 saansad hai
 Let's have a look what the figures in Rajya Sabha say about this important bill? The NDA currently has 81 members out of a total of 242 members of the Rajya Sabha, while the UPA has 138 members
 iske alaava anya 23 hai, jinamein 10 manonith 9 nirdaleey or chaar partiyon ke ek-ek saansad hai
 Even then the NDA is much less than the 122 required for a majority
 aise main agar tiemasi, bispi or sapa bhi endie ke paksh main chale jaaen to bhi endie kii sankhya 117 hogi jo bahumat ke liye zaruri 122 se kam he
 On the other hand, if TMC, BSP and SP remain absent from the House during voting, then the figure required for majority will be reduced to 104, but even then the NDA will have 81 members
 agar beemaa vidheyak par manjuuri mil jaati he, to beemaa kshetra main kai bade badlaav honge
 Accordingly, the limit of foreign investment in domestic insurance companies will increase to 49 per cent, which is currently up to 26 per cent
 nae bill ke mutabik beemaa companiyon ko stock exange main list kiya ja sakegaa
 After this, foreign companies will also get permission to invest in reinsurance companies that insure insurance companies
 philhal desh main chaar sarkari general insurance companiyaan he, jinhen desh ke stock bazaar se puunji ugaahne kii ijazat nahin he
 This will lead to development in the Reinsurance sector in India, where only one General Insurance Corporation, ie GIC, works
 ye sab manmohan singh kii niti he, jisase modi sarkaar bhi sahamat he
 In such a situation, what option does the government have? Now a solution may be to call a joint session of both the houses, but then how often and on how many bills will the joint session be called
 ek or vikalp ho saktaa he ki vipaksh ke saath saudebaaji kii jaae yaa phir beemaa bill ko rajyasabha kii select samiti ko bheja jaae, yaa phir congress ke saath saudebaaji ho, kyonki 1999 main ye bill vaajapeyi sarkaar lekar ai thi, tab congress kaa virodh tha
 Then when the Manmohan Singh government brought this bill in 2008, the BJP opposed it
 phir ye bill sansad kii ek samiti ko bheja gaya, jiske adhyaksh yashavanth sinha the
 Now the Modi government has brought this bill, the Congress is showing its attitude
 vakt-vakt kii baat he or loktantr main sankhya kaa mahatv hota he
 However, a Congress ally is in support of the NCP insurance bill and also the BJD
 
 But the number is still much less than the majority
 aise main congress ke saath sarkaar ko apane rishte banane honge
 There are several issues on which the Congress can be discussed, such as the post of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 kai sansadeey samiti ke adhyaksh kaa pad yaa phir loksabhaa main dipti spikar kaa pad
 If all these things are discussed then it is okay
 congress kahegi ki yah to unka hi bill he, jo endie sarkaar lagu kar rahi he
 Otherwise the government should forget this bill for at least three months or call a joint session after this session of Parliament

 In the residential area of delhi, a corpse is found in the morning a few months ago
 saat tukdon main kati or cartoon box or bag main pack ek laash
 It was clear from the pieces of the corpse that this girl belonged to a girl
 lekin shuruaati chaanbin main naa to marane vaali kii pahchaan pataa chalati he or naa hi qaatilon kaa koi suraag hi miltaa he
 But then suddenly some Herf written on Cartun gives the first clue to the police
 ye darasal ek courier company kaa pataa tha
 So will the police reach the murderer only through this address? On June 21, 2018, at 8:30 am, Sarita Vihar, Delhi, in this garbage bordering a dense residential area, people noticed two things that are usually garbage Is not in the pile of ye thi ek bada sa bag or bag ke paas ek packed cartoon box
 But not only did these two things attract the attention of the people, but people were also disturbed by the stink
 logon kaa maathaa thanka or unhone police ko ittila di
 In the next few minutes, Delhi Police was on the scene
 lekin bag or box ko khangalate hi pulisavaalon ke qadam thithak gaye
 a girl's body was in the bag
 wo bhi saat alag-alag tukdon main
 Arms, legs, head, neck all different
 police ne laash baraamad kii or use postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Apparently, the way the corpse was cut into seven separate pieces and stuffed into bags and cartoons, it was clear that the matter was murder
 lekin maranevaali ladki koun thi? kahaan rahati thi? uskaa qatl kisne kiya? laash ke itane tukade kin halaat main kiye? ye sabhi sawaal abhi ansulajhe the
 However, in order to know the answers to these questions and to reach the killer, the police had to first identify the girl who died
 lekin dikkat ye thi ki aas-paas ke logon se poochtacha karne or bag or cartoon kii puri kahani bataane ke baavjood marane vaali ladki kii shinaakht nahin ho pai
 Even the clothes the girl wore, the police showed those clothes to the people nearby, but no clue was found anywhere
 is koshish main kai rose nikal gaye
 Meanwhile, during the investigation, the police caught sight of something that made him hope that it might provide a clue of his death
 qaatilon ne jis cartoon box main laash ke tukade bhar kar phenke the, us par ek courier company kaa pataa likhaa tha
 The police thought that perhaps some way out of this address
 wo foran gurugram main us courier company ke daftar pahunchi or vahaan usne company ke afasaron ko cartoon box kii tasviren dikhain
 Incidentally, the courier identified the box and stated that one of his customers had booked the parcel from UAE in such a large box
 customer kaa naam tha javed akhtar
 Now the police reached Aligarh at Javed Akhtar's house directly at the address of the courier
 yahaan javed naa sirf police ko mil gaya, jabaki apane cartoon box kii tasviir bhi pahchaan lee
 He said that three years ago, he had ordered some items from UAE in several such cartun boxes
 inamen se kuch box jahaan usne apni naukaraani ko die the vahiin kuch box dilli ke shahinbaag vaale ghar rakhwai thim
 Some boys lived on rent in that house of Shaheenbagh
 ab police ne dilli ke shaheen baag kaa rukh kiya
 All the hopes of the police had now come to this house
 jo bhi suraag milanaa tha yaheen se milanaa tha
 The police team reached out to Javed Akhtar's maid
 vahaan par khaali box mil gaye, iske baad police jab javed ke shaheen baag sthit ghar par pahunchi to vahaan taala laga tha
 This deepened the suspicion of the police on Sajid Ali
 police ne aas-paas ke logon se sajid ke bare main jaankaree jutani shuru kii, to pataa chalaa ki usne vahaan logon se kaha he ki wo ye ghar khaali karke ja rahaa he
 Now the police was looking for Sajid Ali Ansari
 police kii kai timen uski talash main jute gai
 And finally he got caught by the police
 pakade jane ke baad sajid ne qatl kii jo kahani police ko bataai wo chaunkaa dene vaali he
 Sajid Ali told the police that he often had a quarrel with his wife
 jhagade kii do vajah thi ek to uskaa kisi duusari ladki ke saath sambandh or uski berogari
 For this reason, he killed his wife
 20- 21 june kii raat ko usne apni patni kii galaa dabaa kar hatya kar di
 Then together with his two brothers, he cut several pieces of his corpse
 or laash ko ek parcel box main daal kar thikaane laga diya
 According to the police, Sajid Ali felt that he would survive after committing the incident but it did not happen
 us parcel box ne uski sajeesh ko benakaab kar diya
 During interrogation, Sajid told the police that his wife was a Hindu, he had met Rajbala in 2011 while studying
 baad main donon ne shaadi kar lee or patni kaa naam badalakar juhi rakh diya tha
 Sajid is a btech engineer by profession, but has no job

 The world class image of Delhi Metro has received a tremendous shock from a video
 yah video dilli metro ke ek stesan par maujuud signal room kaa he or isamen barish ke dauraan pani kii dharaaen footne lagi, jisase puure signal room main pani bhar gaya
 It is a matter of honor that at the right time, the employees of the Delhi Metro covered the tarpaulin and other waterproof things and saved the entire system of singling from rain water, otherwise the metro network could also come to a standstill
 sutron ke mutabik yah videometroki green line yani indralok mundaka line ke indralok metro stesan kaa he, jahaan barish kaa pani chat se hote hue signal room main tapakane laga or dhire-dhire tapakane kaa silsilaa pani kii tej dhaaraon main badal gaya
 According to metro sources, this room had important equipment and machines of the signaling system, which conducts the metroca automatic operation
 kab metro train aegi, platform par kahaan rukegi or kitni der main platform se phir aage badhegi, ye sabhi baaten automatic train aaparishan ke zarie tay hoti hai or iskaa puraa aadhaar singhling par tikaa hota he
 In such a situation, due to the carelessness of the metro, the entire metro network of the Inderlok line could come to a standstill
 dilli metro rail korporation se email ke jariye video ke bare main jaankaree maangi gai
 Metro asked which metro station this video is from and how did the water fill up in the signal room? How the entire roof of the signal room started flowing and the devices had to be installed till the tarpaulin to protect them from rain water? Who is responsible for this negligence and what action has been taken by the metro so far? Although no response has been received from the DMRC so far, the metro officials have informally admitted that the video of the metro It belongs to the signal room
 haalanki video kii taarikh ko lekar metro abhi bhi chup he
 If the water entered the signaling system, the equipment got wet by water and the machines went bad, the entire signaling system of the metro line would come to a standstill
 puure network par to asar nahin padataa, lekin ek puri line par trek circuit jam ho saktaa tha, jisase jo train jahaan khadi thi, vahiin ruk jaati or inkaa aage badhaane ke liye minial mod par chalaanaa padataa, jisamen speed bahut kam ho jaati he or thodi hi der main trek circuit jam ho jaataa
 According to experts, this was a big negligence, because in this case all the trains running on that line would lose contact with the operation control room
 haalanki mundaka line par underground section nahin he, varanaa kisi underground section par aisi laaparvaahee hoti, to musafiron se bhari train tunnel ke andar fansi rah sakati thi

 a photo posted by Nia Sharma (@niasharma90) on Aug 28, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT On Monday, the army honored Major Lipul Gogoi, who led a Kashmiri convoy in Kashmir to save the stone-pelters by tying the Kashmiri youth on the bonnet of the jeep
 ab lag rahaa he ki centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaar aamane-saamne hai
 On Tuesday, IG Munir Khan of Kashmir said that the investigation against Lipul Gogoi would still continue, adding that an FIR was already registered against him
 isamen kuch bhi nirnay aaye, vah ham nahin jaanate lekin jaanch jari rahegi
 Let me tell you that on Monday only Army Nemer Lipul Gogoiko was honored
 unhen unki vishisht seva ke liye thalsena adhyaksh kii ore se prashasti patr dekar sammanit kiya gaya he
 Earlier, in view of the public outcry against this incident, the Army had set up a Court of Inquiry against this Major, but Major Gogoi got a clean chit in this investigation
 umr abdulla ne twit kiya tha videokashmiri yuvak faruk ahamed ko jeep ke aage baandhne kii ye ghatana 9 april kii he
 a video clip of the incident was tweeted by Omar Abdullah and demanded an inquiry
 yah video soshal media par viral ho gaya tha or iske khilaaf bhartiya sena kii kaaphi aalochana bhi hui thi
 However, some people also supported this action of the army
 is maamle main 15 april kojammu-kashmir police dwaara53 rashtriya rifl ke major nitin gogoi ke khilaaf FIR darj karne ke do din baad court of inquairi baithai thi
 After investigation, it was recommended not to take any action against Major
 yahaan tak ki varisht adhikariyon ne major ke is faisle kii saraahna kii thi kyonki ise patharbaji se nipatane kaa behatar tarika mana gaya

 Election Results 2019: Just before the Lok Sabha election results, Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has questioned the intentions of the parties questioning evms
 unhone (amit Shah) twit kar kaha ki iviem kaa virodh desh kii janata ke janadesh kaa anadar he
 Fueled by the defeat, these 22 parties are taking a question mark on the democratic process of the country and tarnishing the image of the country and its democracy in the world
 unhone (amit Shah) kaha ki EVM par vipaksh dwaara uthaae ja rahe prashn sirf bhranti failaane kaa prayaas he, jisase prabhavit hue bina ham sabko hamaare prajatantric sansthaanon ko or majboot karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 i want to ask all these parties some questions
 EVM kaa virodh desh kii janata ke janadesh kaa anadar he
 Fueled by the defeat, these 22 parties are taking a question mark on the democratic process of the country and tarnishing the image of the country and its democracy in the world
 main in sabhi partiyon se kuch prashn poochna chahta hum
 pic
 twitter
 com / yckqvvolq0 Q-1: Most of these opposition parties questioning the credibility of evms have won the elections held by EVM at one time or another
 yadi unhen EVM par vishwaas nahin he to in dalon ne chunaav jeetne par satta ke sutara ko kyon sambhaala ?prashn-2: desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne teen se zyada PIL kaa sangyaan lene ke baad chunavi prakriya ko antim swaroop diya he
 In which five vvpats have been ordered to be counted in each assembly constituency
 to kya aap log sarvocch nyaayalay ke aadesh par bhi prashnchinh laga rahe he ?prashn-3 : matganana ke sirf do din purv 22 vipakshi dalon dwaara chunavi prakriya main parivartan kii maang purnatah asanvaidhanik he kyonki is tarah kaa koi bhi nirnay sabhi dalon kii sarvasammati ke bina sambhav nahin he
 Question-4: Opposition started the commotion on the subject of EVM after the six-phase voting ended
 eczit pole ke baad yah or teevr ho gaya
 The exit poll is not done on the basis of EVM but by asking questions to the voter
 atah eczit pole ke aadhaar par aap EVM kii vishwasaneeyata par kaise prashn uthaa sakate he?prashn-5 : EVM main gadabadi ke vishay par proective kadam uthaate hue chunaav ayog ne saarvajanik rup se chunauti dekar iske pradarshan kaa aamantran diya tha
 But that challenge was not accepted by any opposition party
 iske baad chunaav ayog ne EVM ko VVPAT se jod kar chunavi prakriya ko or paardarshee kiya
 After the VVPAT process comes, the voter can see which party got his vote registered after casting his vote
 prakriya ke itane paardarshee hone ke baad is par prashn uthaanaa kitna uchit he ?prashn-6: kuch vipakshi dal chunaav parinaam anukool na aane par ‘hathiyaar uthaane' or “khun kii nadiya bahaane“ jaise aapattijanak bayaan de rahe he
 Who is the Opposition telling whom he is challenging with such violent and undemocratic statements? It is noteworthy that the Election Commission has rejected the opposition parties' demand to match VVPAT-EVM before the counting of votes
 mangalvaar ko 22 vipakshi dalon ne chunaav ayog se yah maang kii thi
 The Election Commission has rejected the opposition's demand to first match the VVPAT-EVM before the Lok Sabha Election results are out
 iviem evam vivipieti ke mudde par congress, sapa, basapa, trinmul congress sahit 22 pramukh vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ne mangalvaar ko chunaav ayog kaa rukh kiya or usase yah aagrah kiya tha ki matganana se pehle chuninda matdaan kendron par vivipieti parchiyon kaa milan kiya jaae
 The opposition parties had also said that if the VVPAT slips were not found to be correct even at one polling station, then all the VVPAT slips in the respective constituencies should be counted
 vipakshi netaaon ne kai sthanon par strangroom se iviem ke kathith sthanantaran se judi shikayaton par karrwai kii maang kii thi
 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters, "we have demanded that VVPAT slips should be matched first and then the counting of votes is done
" yah hamaari sabase badi maang hai
 "at the same time, Danish Ali of the BSP had said that the complaints regarding the Strong Room were put before the Election Commission
 darasal, uttar pradesh kaa prashasan manamaani kar rahaa he kyonki bhaajapa ko pataa he ki janata kaa kya faisla diya he
 Now they want to fudge
 telugu desham party ke pramukh chandrababu naidu ne kaha tha ki chunaav ayog yah sunishchit kare ki janadesh ke saath koi chhedchhad nahin ho
 Opposition leaders held a meeting at the Constitution Club before turning to the Election Commission
 vipakshi netaaon kii baithak main congress se ahamed patel, ashok gahalot, gulam nabi aaazaad or abhishek manu singhvi, makapa se seetaram yechuri, trinmul congress se derek obrayan, tedepa se chandrababu naidu, aam aadmi party se arvind kejariwal, sapa se ramgopal yadav, basapa se satish chandra mishra evam danish ali, dramuk se kanimoi, rajd se manoj jha, rakanpa se prafull patel evam maajid memon or kai anya partiyon ke netaa shaamil hue

 Australian opener Aaron Finch has said that if the selectors give him a chance, he is ready to take over the reins of the team
 ball tempring maamle main steve smith or david warner par ek saal kaa pratibandh lagane ke baad team ne simit overon ke liye captain or upakptain talashna shuru kar diya he
 Although Tim Paine has been made the Test captain, he is yet to be named captain for odis and T20s
 finch ne cricket australia website se kaha, 'nishchit rup se main iske liye taiyaar hum
 But to be honest, i have not thought about it
 vaaki, team ke liye yah ek mushkil kshan he
 The Commonwealth Games re-established Australia's reputation after the ball-tempering controversy: According to Peter Batagency, 31-year-old Finch was appointed Australia's captain in the T20 format in 2014, but he captained only six matches and later Smith was handed the captaincy ahead of the 2016 T20 World Cup
 finch ne kaha, 'vanade or tii-20 maichon kii siries ke liye team ko june main england kaa daura karnaa he
 After this, T20 tri series is also to be played in Zimbabwe in July
 aise main agle kuch maheene main kuch badlaav hone vaala he
 If i get a chance, i would love to accept it
 ' 'whatever comes from their eyes, they think that the condition of the sick is good

 But if you get a person from the sick who increases his stress, then it worsens
 baat ho rahi he goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar kii jo ek gambhir beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who went to Goa on a personal visit, reached his office yesterday to meet him
 baad main kochi main booth str ke kaaryakartaaon kii baithak main unhone parrikar kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki ve rafel saude main apni bhoomika se inkaar kar chuke hai
 The same thing was reiterated by Rahul Gandhi at Talkatora Stadium today
 iske baad parrikar ne rahul gandhi ko chitthee likhi he
 He condemned Rahul Gandhi's statement
 patr main parrikar ne likhaa ki ve beemaari kaa haal poochne ke bahaane unase milane aae lekin unhone is mulaakaat kaa apane nimna stareey raajnneetik hiton ko saadhane ke liye istemaal kiya
 Parrikar wrote that Rahul came to meet him without any prior notice
 parrikar ne likhaa ki paanch minute kii mulaakaat main na to rafel kaa zikr hua or na hi unhone rafel sambandhi koi charchaa kii
 Parrikar wrote that he has said many times before and once again said that the Rafale deal is between two governments and all the rules were followed
 isamen dur-dur tak koi gadabadi nahin hui he
 This entire process has taken place under the regulators decided on the basis of national security priorities
 parrikar ne aage likhaa ki shishtachar bhent ke bahaane mere ghar aakar phir itane nimna str kaa jhooth aadhaarit raajnneetik bayaan dena aapke mere ghar aane ke uddeshyon evam iraadon ko ujagar karata he
 Parrikar writes that he is fighting for the survival of his life in sickness and is engaged in the service of Goa
 unhone rahul se aakhir main nivedan kiya ki kisi biimaar or aswasth vyakti ko apni avasarwaadi raajnneeti kaa shikaar banane kii niyat na rakhen
 Soon after, BJP President Amit Shah's tweet also came
 unhone likhaa priy rahul gandhi, beemaari se jujh rahe ek vyakti ke naam par jhooth bolkar aapane dikhaa diya ki aap kitne samvedanheen hai
 People of India are upset with your behavior
 manohar parrikar ne vastusthiti bataa di he
 On the other hand, Congress sources have said that Rahul Gandhi has already made it clear that it was a private meeting
 agar aap parrikar kaa patr dekhenge to paaenge ki unhone yah kahin nahin likhaa he ki unhen rafel saude ke radd hone kii jaankaree thi
 This is what Rahul Gandhi has alleged today
 congress netaaon ke anusaar rahul gandhi ne yah kahin nahin kaha ki kal kii mulaakaat main parrikar ne unhen rafel ke bare main koi jaankaree di
 But the question is arising that the way Rahul Gandhi suddenly came to meet Parrikar and after that he gave the name of Parrikar first in Kochi and then in Delhi, does that mean that the motive behind this meeting is not just to ask the situation There was something else
 to aakhir iskaa sach kya he? rahul kii baat sahi he yaa phir parrikar kii?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 We would have needed Kuldeep, but looking at the circumstances of the second Test match, the fast bowler would have been a better option
 'iske alaava shastri ne tisare test match se pehle sangharsh kar rahe team ke ballebaajon se adhik anushaasan or dhairya dikhaane kii maang kii he
 Atal said that after winning the game, not only the game but also the hearts of the cricketers going to the PAK, Anasastri said, 'the circumstances in this series have been very difficult
 lekin aisi hi sthiti main aapako jajba or anushaasan dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa he
 You have to be aware of the off stump and drop a lot of balls
 aapako dhairya dikhaane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
