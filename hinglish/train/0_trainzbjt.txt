 The 123rd Constitutional Amendment Bill in relation to giving constitutional status to the National Backward Classes Commission was introduced in the Rajya Sabha today after it was passed by the Lok Sabha
 sarkaar kii taraf se bill main kuch sanshodhan kiye gaye hai jisamen ayog main mahila sadsy ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 At the same time, attempts have also been made to remove the doubts of the opposition regarding interference in the rights of the states
 congress ne bhi rajyasabha main is bill kaa samarthan karne kii baat kahi he
 Let me tell you that the government was embarrassed about this bill when the opposition's amendment on this bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha last year
 lihaaja sarkaar kii taraf se bill main kuch sanshodhan kar dobaaraa pesh karnaa padaa
 This Constitutional Amendment Bill was unanimously passed in the Lok Sabha but due to lack of sufficient strength in the Rajya Sabha, the government may face difficulties
 haalanki yadi bijedy or samaajawaadee party kaa samarthan miltaa he to bill rajyasabha main bhi paas ho saktaa he
 After the passage of this bill, the National Backward Classes Commission will be formed for socially and educationally backward classes
 is ayog main ek adhyaksh, upaadhyaksh or teen anya sadsy honge 
 The terms of service and terms of office of the Chairman, vice-chairman and other members appointed in this way will be subject to the President
 ayog ko apni swayan kii prakriya nirdhaarit karne kii shakti hogi
 Let me tell you that the Backward Classes Commission set up in 1993, till now only worked on social and educational grounds to include backward castes in the list of backward classes or exclude the already included castes from the list
 is vidheyak ke paarit hone ke baad sanvaidhanik darja milane kii vajah se samvidhan main anuchhed 342 (k) jodakar prastaavit ayog ko civil nyaayalay ke samakaksh adhikaar diye ja sakenge
 This will give the commission the right to redress the grievances of the backward classes

 com / 592g0loaso Union Law Minister Ashwani Kumar said on Saturday that one of the reasons for not making marital rape a crime in the recent ordinance is that marriage in India is not considered a contract, as it is in other democratic countries
 indian marchents chembar dwaara yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue mantri ne kaha ki kanoon ko hameshaa samasamyik hakikaton ko parilakshith karnaa chahie
 Kumar said, "the law can neither be made or amended keeping only one case in mind
" kanoon ko is tareeke se banaaya janaa chahie ki yah dashakon ke liye har maamle main tikaa rah sake
 The law must reflect contemporary realities of society and help the country's progress
 ’’ Regarding the recently issued Crime Law (amendment) Ordinance to amend the laws related to sexual offenses, he said, "we did not include marital rape in the ordinance for various reasons
" unamem se ek yah he ki hamaare desh main vivaah ko anya loktantric deshon kii tarah anubandh nahin mana jaataa he

 If the law is deficient, it can lead to serious violations
 ’’ Giving the example of Section 498 (A) of the Indian Penal Code, Kumar said, "this section is being misused a lot
" lekin main is bare main kuch nahin kar saktaa kyonki main kuch karuunga to kai mahila sanghathan iske khilaaf khadey honge
 But what needs to be seen is that women are being accused under 498 (A)
 ’’ Addressing an event organized by the Indian Merchants' Chamber, the Minister said that the law should always reflect contemporary reality
 kumaar ne kaha, ‘‘sirf ek maamle ko dhyaan main rakhkar kanoon na to banaaya ja saktaa he na usamen sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 The law should be made in such a way that it can survive in every case for decades

 Now, with the increase in the day of November, the question has also arisen that which will be the highest grossing film this time
 agar abhi ke aankadon dekhen to is hisaab se salmaan khan kii'sultan'hi top par he
 The film grosses around 300 crores
 to duusare number par cricketer dhoni kii jindagi par bani sushant singh rajput kii film'em
 s
 dhoni'he
 The film is reported to have grossed 132 crores
 or koun-si filmein hai list mentisre, chauthe or paanchaven, lagaataar teen pojishans par ek saath harrkshay kumaar
 His film 'airlift' is number three with a gross of 129 crores
 kareeb 127 karod ke saath'rustam'chauthe or 107
 Housefull 3 'with 70 crores
 paanchaven number par he
 Shahrukh Khan's 'fan' is not included in the 100 crore club but with the gross of 84 crores, it is at number six in the list of hit films
 relies ke pehle hafte main 80 karod kamakar 'i dil he mushkil' 7wein number par he
 Right now the film is running in theaters, so there can be a change in the list from here
 8wein number par 'baagi'tiger shrofahain
 His film has grossed 76 crores
 sonam kapur kii 'neeraja' 75 karod kii kamai ke saath nauven number par he
 At present at number 10 is 'kapoor and Sons', which has an earning of 73 crores
 haalanki yah list change ho sakati he kyonki'shivaay'pehle hafte main 70 karod kama chuki he
 At the moment it has got theaters, the earnings figure can go up
 kya palat saktaa he pasa
 
 
 Salman Khanahi is currently in the top 10 grossing films in 2016, 'sultan'
 koi bhi film unke aage tik nahin pai he
 In such a situation, it is expected that this year's biggest hit will be Salman Khan's name
 lekin salmaan ko unke hi andaaj main chunauti dene disambar main aa rahe hai aamir khan
 The craze of his film can be gauged from the fact that the trailer of 'dangal' set the record for the most hits
 phir aamir kii filmein har lihaaj se behad majboot hoti hai
 In such a situation, it is expected that there will be a tremendous riot in the same and common for the top position in the earnings arena
 isi bich shahrukh kii 'dear jindagi' bhi aa rahi he
 However, the trailer of the film is getting good views and reviews
 magar is tarah kii sweet filmon ko aksar single screen par zyada collection nahin milti
 In such a situation, Shah Rukhbaki does not appear to be a big threat to both the Khans
 magar phir bhi ye khan war he to koun kab kise chit, kar de to kaha bhi nahin ja saktaa
 
 
 nda's Harivansh Singh registered a landslide victory in the Deputy Speaker election held in Rajya Sabha on 9 August 2018
 upree sadan main modi sarkaar ko mili is jeet ke bade myne nikaale ja rahe hai, ise vipakshi ekta main badi send kii tarah dekha ja rahaa he
 But if we turn the clock back a little, the Bharatiya Janata Party suffered a crushing defeat in the Rajya Sabha election of Gujarat on August 8, 2017, exactly a year ago
 yani ek saal pehle mili us badi haar kaa hisaab bijepi ne ab baraabar kar liya he
 Actually, on 8 August 2017, voting was held for the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 lekin wo drama itnaa lanbaa chalaa tha ki nateeja aate-aate 9 agast ho gai thi
 That is, after exactly one year, BJP equated its defeat with the Deputy Chairman election
 antar bas itnaa he ki wo rajyasabha saansad kaa chunaav tha or ye upasabhapati kaa chunaav
 Then how did Ahmed Patel beat Shah
 
 
 pichley saal gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav main bhi aisi hi tasviir bani thi
 There was a one-vote battle in that too
 us chunaav ko bhi bijepi ne pratishtha kaa prashn bana liya tha
 But at the time, Ahmed Patel proved to be a juggler
 gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav main kul 176 vot kiye gaye the
 Of these, 2 votes were canceled, due to which 174 votes were counted
 ek samay haarate dikh rahe ahamed patel ain vakt par jeet darj karne main kaamyaab ho gaye
 He defeated BJP candidate Balwant Rajput
 us chunaav main puure din hivoltage drama chalaa tha
 Amit Shah himself was camping in Gujarat
 ladaai is kadar thi ki gujarat se lekar dilli main chunaav ayog tak sargarmi thi
 The Congress reached the Election Commission's door late in the night due to the cancellation of votes of two mlas
 congress ke is prayaas ko kamjor karne ke liye bijepi ne 6 kendriya mantriyon kaa dailygation chunaav ayog bheja tha
 Finally, Ahmed Patel won the election, during which it was considered a major setback for the BJP before the Gujarat assembly elections
 ab shah-modi kii ranneeti ne ekajute vipaksh ko di karaari maat
 
 
 Before the election, the NDA was in the minority in the Rajya Sabha and his candidate's victory was also difficult
 lekin modi or shah kii jodi ne ek baar phir apana khel dikhaaya or puraa pasa puri tarah palat gaya
 In fact, before voting, BJP succeeded in bringing the BJD of Odisha, TRS of Telangana, AIADMK of Tamil Nadu in its favor
 jabaki aadhikarik taur par ye teenon dal endie kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Apart from this, YSR Congress and Aam Aadmi Party not taking part in voting also went in favor of NDA
 saath hi bijepi endie ke apane naaraaz saathi akali dal or shivasena jaise dalon ko bhi saadhane main kaamyaab rahi
 Both parties were said to be angry with BJP, but after Nitish Kumar spoke, both voted in favor of the government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi uddhav thakare ko sarkaar kaa samarthan karne ke liye dhanyavad diya
 If another NDA kept itself united, the opposition could not decide its candidate till the last time
 congress netaa digvijay singh ne somvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye sanketon main 'hitler' shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 It is a coincidence that the day before, a Chief Minister of this country said that he had no objection to being called Hitler
 yah hai telugana ke nae navele mukhyamantri ke
 Chandrasekhar Rao
 unhone ravivaar ko mana ki unhen hitler kaha jaataa rahaa he or is bare main unhen jaraa bhi shame mahasoos nahin hoti

 Chandrasekhar Rao was defending the proposed survey on behalf of the government, which has to cost about Rs 20 crore

 com / fap4faqkoc — Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) March 19, 2018 sarkaar ke sheersh sutron kaa kahana he ki bainkon kaa kaamkaaj is maheene ke ant tak saamaanya ho jayega, kyonki 2,000 rupee ke nae noton kii chapai kaa kaam lagbhag puraa ho chukaa he, or deshbhar main maujuud do lakh se zyaada atm mashiinon ke nae noton ke aakaar ke hisaab se ri-calibratt kiye jane kaa kaam bhi tab tak puraa ho jane kii sambhaavna he, jisase nakadi kaa sankat kam ho jayega
 Sources have said that the government is of the view that the replacement of old 500 and 1,000 rupee old currency notes with new ones should be stopped altogether, and then when the functioning of the banks becomes normal, and atms of Rs 2,000 When new notes start to be withdrawn, then the old notes can only be deposited in banks
 sarkaar puraane noton ko nae noton se badale jane kii seemaa pehle hi gata chuki he, or 4,500 rupee ke sthaan par shuukravaar se sirf 2,000 rupee ke puraane note hi badale ja sakenge
 The exchange of notes through bank or post office is also allowed only for one time, but the last date for depositing old notes in banks is December 30
 8 november se hi, jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 500 or 1,000 rupee ke noton ko achaanak band kar dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi, bainkon ke baahar logon kii lambii-lambii kataren ghanton lagi rahati hai, taaki puraane noton ko badalawaaya ja sake
 This has greatly affected normal banking operations

 The government says that the announcement had to be made suddenly, so that those possessing black money or undisclosed money could not get a chance to change that money
 tippaniyan Sources said that to replace the discontinued notes, it was also decided to print the first 2,000 rupee notes in place of the new notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees, because the money was changed in the shortest time keeping all the action secret
 This was the way of vaise, ab sarkaar ne 500 rupee kaa nayaa note bhi jari kar diya he
 The discontinued notes were 86 percent of the total currency notes circulating in the country, and the bank system is now under tremendous pressure to replace them
 reserve bank of india (arabiai) ne guuruuvaar ko doharaaya ki lagbhag do maheene pehle zorshor se shuru kii gai nae noton kii chapai ke parinamswaroop nae noton kii paryaapt aapurti ho rahi he
 The Reserve Bank of India has urged the public not to panic, and not to hoard new notes
 sutron ne bataaya he ki sarkaar kaa vichaar he ki band kiye ja chuke 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ko nae noton se badale jane kaa kaam bilkul band kar diya jaae, or phir jab bainkon kaa kaamkaaj saamaanya ho jaae, or atm 2,000 rupee ke nae note nikaalane lagen, tab puraane noton ko sirf bainkon main jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 The government has already reduced the limit of replacing old notes with new ones, and instead of Rs 4,500 only old notes of Rs 2,000 will be replaced from Friday
 bank yaa daakghar ke zariye note badalane kii anumati bhi sirf ek baar ke liye he, lekin puraane noton ko bainkon main jamaa karaane kii antim tithi 30 disambar he
 Since 8 November, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the sudden closure of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, long queues of people outside the banks have been waiting for hours to replace the old notes
 isse saamaanya banking kaamkaaj kaaphi prabhavit hua he
 The central government, which is facing criticism for the problems facing the common people, has rejected the allegation of opposition parties that demonetization or demonetisation was not planned properly
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki ghoshnaa achaanak kiya janaa zaruri tha, taaki kaala dhan yaa aghoshit dhan rakhane waalon ko us dhan ko badalane kaa mauka na mil sake

 Kejriwal has got a bungalow on Bhagwandas Road in Delhi

 Kejriwal's house will be in five rooms, while in the remaining five rooms he will run the office
 haalanki kejariwal ne pehle kaha tha ki wo do kamaron ke makaan main hi rahenge
 What did Kejriwal say on the new bungalow?

 There are two houses of 5–5 rooms each

 The credit for this also goes to the opposition

 Because of them, we were able to take some important decisions to take the nation forward
 '' pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal 15 agast ko laal kile kii pracheer se ye baaten kahi thim

 The current monsoon session of Parliament was deadlocked and the NDA was unable to move any important bill in favor of its agenda of economic reform and growth
 udyog jagat sansad ko thap karne kaa dosha congress ke sir par madh rahaa he lekin kuch jaankaron ne ab sarkaar kii vachanabaddhata par bhi sawaal uthaane shuru kar die hai
 However, what seems to bother the Prime Minister is not that he was forced to put the Land Acquisition Bill on hold, but he is worried about that anti-farmer, anti-labor and pro-corporate image of the government The Congress was trying hard for this
 so, modi apane duusare swatantraaa diwas abhibhaashan main zyada loklubhaavan yojanaon kaa elaan kar sakate hai lekin unke virdohi un paanch yojanaon kii vyaavhaarikta par hi sawaal khadey kar rahe hai, jinaki ghoshnaa unhone pichley agast main kii thi
 It is true that the performance of these schemes has not been effective
 inamen se adhiktar yojanaon ke liye paryaapt dhan kaa aavanton nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, the Parliament's Estimates Committee headed by senior BJP leader Murlimanohar Joshi on the much-hyped Swachh Bharat Mission commented sharply on the lack of adequate funds allocation
 haal main loksabhaa ko saunpi gai report main samiti ne kaha ki sarkaar ne is yojana ke liye paise jutaney kaa koi khaakaa taiyaar nahin kiya he jabaki is pariyojna par 2019 tak kriyanvayan ke liye centre sarkaar ko kam se kam 65,000 karod ru

 The wait is still on and that is why the writer and political commentator Gurcharan Das cautions the Prime Minister to implement the old plans instead of announcing new plans
 das kehete hai, ''kaarobaar ke liye sahuuliyat se judi vishwa bank kii report jald hi aane vaali he
 Modi would like India to be ranked 50 in this but i am not hopeful that India will be able to reach 120th position as well

 "the figures are not surprising as the account holder has to run the account for six months to claim an overdraft," says Jayant Sinha, Union Minister of State for Finance

 In such a situation, giving seat to Rajbhar is a profitable deal for SP

 Sandeep, underlining the possibility of amendments in the Lokpal bill, said that Anna's team has also amended its bill tens of times
 isliye vah koi antim bill nahin he
 Therefore, talk of government and opposition should also be heard so that this bill can be strengthened further
 sattadhari party kaa paksh rakhte hue unhone kaha ki koi bhi anna ke bill ke khilaaf nahin he or itihaas main pehali baar aisa hua he ki kisi nijee paksh ke vidheyak par 40 main se 36 maangon ko sarkaar dwaara maan liya gaya he

 unhone kaha ki lokapal ke dhaanche main kahin bhi yah nahin bataaya gaya he ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke logon ko kahaan rakhaa jayega
 If the people of this class are not compulsorily appointed, how will their interests be protected

 After being elected the leader of the BJP parliamentary party after the Lok Sabha elections in May 2014, Modi's tears were spelled out in the Central Hall of Parliament, referring to LK Advani's statement (pleased by Narendra Bhai)
 us samay rote hue modi ne kaha tha ki vah (adwani) krupa shabd kaa prayog na karen, maa kii seva kabhi krupa nahin hoti
 For me, BJP is like a mother
 may 2014main pradhanmantri banane se pehle modi ke liye gujarat vidhansabha main vishesh satr rakhaa gaya tha
 In this, Modi also praised the opposition in his farewell address
 jab vipaksh ke netaa unhen shubhakamanaayen de rahe the, tab modi bhaashan dete hue bhavuk ho gaye the

 kya aapane kabhi suna he ki kisi lutane vaale ko khud pataa naa ho ki uskaa kitna lut gaya? wo bhi tab jab baat karodon kii ho? bhala itani moti rakam koi kaise bhul saktaa he? shaayad bhul saktaa he, tab jab uske paas in paison kaa koi hisaab-kitaab hi naa ho
 The biggest truth of Delhi's biggest loot is that at the moment no one knows who robbed and how much he looted
 What was the loot amount of six crore, eight crore or 15 crore? This is the first time that the robber himself is hiding how many crores of robbers robbed him? He is also hiding how much was the foreign currency in addition to the Indian currency in the loot amount? He is also hiding where so much money came from and where he was going? The old record of the robber is this time both the robber and the robber are under the suspicion of the police
 isaki vajah naa sirf lut kii badi rakam he balki luute gaye logon kaa purana record bhi
 The record that raises suspicion that the looted money may be part of a larger syndicate of crime
 mangalvaar ko dilli ke lajpat nagar main honda city car main jo rakam luti gai vah rajesh kalra or unke partner kii thi
 This is the same Rajesh Kalra who came out as a villain in 2000 after the biggest uproar in match fixing in the country
 rajesh kalra par iljaam tha ki buki sanjeev chawla ke kehane par isi ne south africa ke captain hansee chronie ko phone kharid kar diya tha
 And on the same phone, Cronje gave Sanjeev Chawla all the updates about the match
 match phixing kaa khulaasa hone ke baad rajesh kalra pakadaa gaya or jail bhi gaya
 13 years later, before the retirement, Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar got a charge sheet made about match fixing and presented in the court
 is chargeshit main rajesh kalra kaa bhi naam he
 Although he is out on bail
 vaardaat kii jagah, tarika or samay se jude hai kai sawalsouth dilli kaa lajpat nagar ilaaka dilli ke sabase biji root main se ek he
 It is one of the highest traffic areas of Delhi
 phir bhi lutere vaardaat ke liye usee jagah ko chunate hai
 With all the danger
 iske baad rajesh kalra ke ghar se lekar mauka-e-vaardaat tak or phir vaardaat tak kul 25 minute lagate hai
 Then in this game of four cars, one of the most important car in which the security guard was sitting with the gun, his car is left behind
 kyon?flashbek: kaise hui lootmangalvaar subah kareeb nau baje rajesh kalra ke ghar kalkaji se uskaa manager rakesh sharma do bag main karodon rupee rakh kar honda city main chaar logon ke saath nikalataa he
 The five were to go to Karol Bagh and Connaught Place
 honda city ko escort karne ke liye uske peeche ek ai-ten car chal rahi thi
 In which Rajesh Kalra was accompanied by a security guard and two people with licensed guns
 magar moolchand fliover ke neeche biarti coridor par pahunchate hi trephic kii vajah se ai-ten car peeche rah jaati he
 Meanwhile, at around 9
25 am, a Wagon r car first arrives and overtakes it, hitting the Honda City and stopping in front of it
 takkar hote hi honda city kaa driver neeche utarataa he or wagon-aar ke driver se ladane lagata he
 At the same time a white or else car comes from behind
 usamen se chaar-paanch log utarate hai or honda city main savaar logon ko gan point par neeche utaar dete hai
 He then escapes in the same Honda City carrying both bags full of notes kept in the car
 baad main pataa chalata he ki wagon aar or varanaa donon hi chori kii kaaren thi
 Later, the robbers of Honda City also leave the roadside in Kotla Mubarakpur
 lut ke 35 minute baad police ko di jaankaridin-dahaade itani badi lut ho jaati he, lekin lut kii jaankaree police ko vaardaat ke kareeb 35 minute baad di jaati he
 After the arrival of the police, the people in the car tell about the robbery, but they do not tell the exact amount of money in the car
 car savaar logon se pataa chalata he ki paise rajesh kalra or uske bijness partner rahul ahuja ke the
 Police suspects up to 15 crores The amount of the robbery Rajesh Kalra and Rahul Ahuja reach the police and first tell that the car had six crore few lakh rupees
 par rajesh kalra ke manager ne bataaya ki car main 4 karod 69 lakh rajesh kalra ke the jabaki teen karod rahul ahuja ke
 That means a total of 7 crore 69 lakhs
 isamen indian karansi ke alaava euro or dollar bhi the
 Given the amount of foreign currency reported, the police suspect that the amount looted could be from 10 to 15 million
 police sutron ke mutabik rajesh kalra, rahul ahuja unke manager or driver se poochtacha ke dauraan ye pataa chalaa ki ye log pehle bhi isi tarah car main karodon rupee rakh kar karol baag or conot place or baaki jagah jate rahe hai
 During this time these people used to take 10 to 15 crores with them
 kya lut gaya paisa hawala se aayaa tha?lut main police ke saamne sabase bada sawaal yah tha ki aakhir itani badi rakam koi car main lekar kyon ja rahaa tha? police sutron ke mutabik shuruaati poochtacha main rajesh kalra ne bataaya ki saare paise south dilli main property kii ek deal se aae the
 When the police investigated all the big deals of property in South Delhi in the last 15 days, it was found that no such big deal was done recently
 police sutron ke mutabik baad main unhone bataaya ki ye paise chandani chowk ke ek dealer se mili the
 But this also turned out to be wrong
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki rajesh kalra or uskaa partner rahul ahuja ab tak paison ke bare main koi tasallibaksh jawaab nahin de paae hai
 The way he is lying again and again, it is clear that money is related to the business of black money and hawala
 ho saktaa he sabase bade hawala racket kaa pardafashpulice poochtacha main un logon ne bataaya tha ki saare paise wo karol baag, conot place or chandani chowk ke alag-alag bainkon main jamaa karaane ja rahe the
 Later it was found out that he was right, as both Rajesh Kalra and Rahul Ahuja have accounts in different banks at these places
 police sutro kii maane to lut kii is vaardaat ko sulajhaate-sulajhaate mumkin he ki wo dilli main hawala ke ek bade racket kaa pardaafash bhi kar den
 According to sources, Rajesh Kalra was completely silent after coming out on bail in the match fixing case
 gudgaanv chhodkar wo south dilli main aa basaa or yaheen usne property dling kaa dhandha shuru kar diya
 Rahul Ahuja of Gurgaon became his partner
 police ko shaq he ki property kaa dhandha sirf dikhaave ke liye tha
 24 teams of police are behind the robbers
 The Delhi Police has given its full strength to catch the robbers
 dilli police kii kareeb 24 timen is kaam main din-raat lagi hai
 These include South, South East, Crime Branch, Special Cell and many other police teams of other district
 iske alaava hawala ke maamle ko dekhte hue dilli police jaanch main inakam tex department kii bhi madad le rahi he
 Rajesh Kalra, his partner Rahul Ahuja and the driver of Rajesh Kalra who was driving a Honda City car during the incident are all from Haryana
 lihaaja police haryana gang ko saamne rakh kar maamle kii jaanch aage badha rahi he
 In this connection, raids have so far been conducted in many areas of Haryana and outer Delhi
 shaq he ki gang se jude logon kaa rohtak se conection he
 According to police sources, someone inside has got the gang of robbers, the person inside has given complete information
 varna kab kitne rupee lekar, kis car or kis raste se wo jane vaale hai ye luteron ko pataa nahin chalata
 However, no major gangster can be denied to be behind this robbery
 bakaul police haal ke vakt main aisi badi lutpaat ko anjaam dene vaale haryana ke kuch kukhyaat lutere niraj bavania, vikaas lagarpuria or nitu dabodiya ke saathi paras ko bhi dhundha ja rahaa he
 All of them have already come out of jail on bail and are missing

 Director Tigmanshu Dhulia has so far killed LG Fire
 hasil se lekar paan singh tomars or sahib bibi gangster tak
 We succumbed to it and died
 magar behad niraashaa ke saath likhnaa pad rahaa he ki bullate raja kii bullate bharwaan he
 There is a lot of voice in this, but no power
 camershal cinema banane ke pher main unhone bhaanti-bhaanti ke kachare bhar die hai apane jabar dialogs, pechdaar kahani or kuch umdaa asal se lagate kirdaaron ke bich
 Bullet Raja is the story of Raja Mishra, a young man from Badale, who lives with his family in Lucknow
 naukari kii talash main bhatakate raja kii ek din ho jaati he fite or peetate-bachate vah pahunchate hai ek baraat main
 Here he meets Rudra
 usee din rudra ke ghar par unke rishte ke dagaabaaz chachaa lallan apane fouj phate ke saath kar dete hai hamalaa
 Raja and Rudra take over the front and after this he gets caught under the logic of need after initial hesitance in the clutches of Gundai
 jail se nikal kar jab donon ek cond ko anjaam dete hai raajnneetik sangrakshan main to unki jaraayam kii duniya main bohani ho jaati he
 Then both become the Bahubali of a leader and tighten their Bhokal
 raja-rudra kii kabhi bullate to kabhi bulero savaar jodi ke jalwe ke saamne koi dushman nahin tik paata
 During this time, one of his dhanpashu gets in front of him
 tabhi dilaphenk raja kii mulaakaat ek bengali bala se hoti he, jo bilaat sidhi he
 Now the line from the film action starts sliding on the track of Badal Ishq
 magar siyasat syaat dekhakar to chalati nahin
 So, the king and Rudra then return to the world of action and adventure
 qurbaani hoti he or badla lene kaa thor paidaa ho jaataa he
 During this time many politicians, policemen and Dhankubers follow their tricks on this back
 kuch der ke liye chambal ke chaukeedaar yani arun singh munna naam ke police vaale bhi aate hai or apni bhoomika adaa karte hai
 On the side is Bahubali, who is on the verge of having an X, Radha has become waiting for Katal to be accused of being accused, who keeps humming as a comeback
 ab jab ye sab aaenge to garmi to badhegi hi
 But what is so much that the men began to wait for settlement after doing everything
 ab baithaate hai film sameekshak vaali panchayat
 Jimmy Shergill, who came with a thin mustache in the role of Rudra in the film, did a good job
 magar is baar unka role saporting tha
 Saif Ali Khan with the main lead was average
 dikkat ye he ki is tarah ke upi mafia ke role ke liye khud unke langadaa tyaagi ke kirdaar ne paimaane bahut oonche kar die hai
 Admittedly, Tyagi was rustic and Raja Misra is urban, but in the nineties, mafia goats from Lucknow and other universities were not so light as to get wet from the roof to the Aashiqui, and then turn into a pungent rock
 sonakshi sinha ke hisse ek baar phir sharmaana itaraana or do gane aae
 At the disco on the show, she seemed somewhat modest and Desi Ada stayed away from them in the disc of Mumbai
 haa romantic trek saamne he savera main jarur unki sambhaavnaaon kaa sahar kuch najar aayaa
 The rest was the scope for Ravi Kishan in Sumer Yadav's role and he played it well
 raaj babbar netaa ke role main ausat rahe to vidyul jamwaal ection karte hue bhale dikhe, magar acting kaa unhen puraa kaa puraa kakehara siikhnaa he
 Mahi Gill's item number was another weak shot of this stuffed film
 ek actor kaa or zikr jaruri he
 The name is Rajiv Gupta
 ye vahi rajeev hai, jinhen aap paan singh tomars main bataur police inspector dekh chuke hai or jo paan singh dadda ke dhamkaane par, he vardi hamako kshamaa kar do vaala dialog bolte hai
 And if you want to remember, then remember the leader of the Sahib Biwi Gangster who says in a soft but chirpy voice on Sahib's garb that you have spoken good rajeev ke hisse yahaan ek netaa kaa role aayaa, zyada kuch karne ko nahin tha, magar jitna tha, utane main jame
 You will also see them soon in Aamir Khan's PK
 tigmanshu dhulia hamaari film industry ke kuch behad sambhaavnashil, pratibhashali or asal filmkaaron main se hai
 His ability was seen as a casting director in Bandit Queen, while as a dialogue writer Irrfan and Ashutosh Rana
 nirdeshak vah kitne kamaal ke hai yah paan singh tomars ne hamen bataaya
 But in this film, only a few teaser trailers of his inner genius were seen
 jabar panch vaale dialogs main yaa kai jagah upi kii raajnneeti or badmaashi ke sambandh or virodhabhas main
 But the film is like a dalia adorned with various types of dishes to be tied in a gauné, with ladoos made of maida puri and some namkeen
 is baar unki daliya main ek hi kism kaa or baazaaroo sa maal dikhaa
 He compromised with his real cinema in a big star cast and indiscriminate earnings at the box office
 film ke gane thunse gaye se lagate hai
 The film starts with the title track and you are still taking your position on the seat that Mahi Gill's item number Don't Touch My Body Aag Lagta Hai on the forehead
 iske baad sata ke thonko bardaasht kariye or tab tak hajir he tamanchey par disco, jo aradibi ke rap ke saath phir bhi kuch minute gujarava detaa he
 The slow romantic number shot in the streets of Kolkata is in front of dawn, but by then, the quota of songs has started booming
 film jahaan bhi jitani bhi chalegi or yaad rahegi to apane dialogs ke liye
 Many of these you hear during the trailer and are filled with expectation
 masalan, brahman ruthaa to ravan yaa phir ham aaenge to garmi badhayenge
 But every character in Bullet Raja speaks so much that it becomes difficult to save dialogues between these five effects
 film main saf or jimi kii chemistry jami he, magar uske liye zyada vakt nahin nikal paaya
 Actors with small roles leave a good impression
 film first half main ghistati he bhoomika banane ke chakkar main or second half main acchhee raftaar pakadati he
 So see Bullet Raja if you want to enjoy the language of the words of Katte Tamanche of Hindi Pradesh, there are some scenes of Gundai to be seen and like Dhansu Tavar with Dhanya Dhanya
 ye total masala film he, magar isamen kuch bahut nayaa navela nahin he
 There is no Tigmanshu in it, whom we have come to know so far and have expressed our love towards him
 film main bullate gaadi he, bullate kaartoos he magar bul yani sand vaala baitha to mast or chalaa to khoonkhaar tevar nahin

 congress ise nijee bayaan kah rahi he
 BJP is considering this as an example of morality falling in the Congress

 With this, Divya said that no one can force her to give any kind of clarification on this tweet
 divya ne ise personal twit qaraar dete hue kaha he ki vah kisi duusare ke nijee vichaaron kii parvaah nahin karti hai
 When you're done huffing & puffing take a breath & hold a mirror to yourselves
 My views are mine

 I’m not going to clarify what i meant and what i didn’t cos you don’t deserve one

 bhalaa kii khubasurat aishwarya raay bachchan jaisi shakhsiyat se jaise desh kaa baccha-baccha waakif he
 Due to her beauty, she has managed to make a mark in the whole world
 lekin aishwarya naa sirf apni beauty ke liye jaani jaati hai balki vah bollywood industry main flop filmein dene ko lekar bhi mashhoor hai
 The surprising thing is that Aishwarya is standing in the industry even after giving big flop films one after the other and that too with complete domination
 aaj bhi vah deepika padukon, priyanka chopra jaisi top actress ko takkar de rahi hai
 After all, what is Aishwaryaka's charm still growing among fans with her growing age, increasing beauty? Let's know: Star is not an international star
 Aishwaryahit learns how to play in the entertainment industry without giving films and despite career breaks
 aishwarya kii filmon kaa jaadu chaahe darshakon ke sir naa chadh paaya ho lekin international plateform par unki ek jhalak kaa aaj bhi phans ko intjaar rahata he
 Whether it is an Cannes festival or an international beauty product, Aishwarya is still probably the most demanding Indian actress at these levels
 media kii fevorett ashkitne hi sitare bollywood main paanv jamaane ke liye publicity stant yaa controvarsi main bane rahane kii jugat main rahete hai lekin aish kii class hi alag he
 They do not have to work for all these pants for their career or fame
 is maamle main aishwarya lucky hai
 One reason for this is that his name is associated with the big giants of the industry
 bachchan parivaar kii actress bahu kaa tag bhi unhen khabaron main chhaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi he or duusari or aaj bhi kahin naa kahin unke eks bwoyfriend or bollywood ke sultan salmaan khan ke saath unka naam naa chaahate hue bhi jud hi jaataa he
 Entering after the break is beneficial for Ash, this career does not end with the career of the brake actress
 This thing does not apply at all to Aishwarya Rai
 paanch saal tak bollywood se brake lene ke baadaaishwaryaka kambek karnaa shaayad unke liye lucky rahaa
 Although his film 'jazbaa' released last year was a flop, but critics praised Nikhar for his performance
 filmon ke flop hone ke baavjood bollywood ke best diarectors main se ek karan johar ne unhen apni film 'e dil he mushkil' ke liye sin kiya
 It is clear that the film may be a flop but Aishwarya will remain a hit
 aishwarya kii wine beautyaishwarya kii khubsuurati kii wine ke saath tulana kii jaae to galat nahin hoga
 Aishwarya turns 43 today (november 1) and age is just number one for this actress
 jis tarah wine jitani puraani hoti jaati he uskaa test utana hi mjedaar hota he to aishwarya kii khubsuurati bhi kuch aisi hi he
 She is growing more and more older with age
 yahi vajah he jo darshak unki film 'i dil he mushkil' main unke bold andaaj ke kaayal ho gaye hai
 The hard work behind Aishwarya's fitness and makeovers is evident in this
 isliye aaj bhi diarectors unhen bollywood ke yang actors ke saath sin karne main peeche nahin hatate
 Some time ago a chaiwala from Pakistan got tremendous buzz on social media

 He was born on 14 April 1891 in Mhow Cantonment, Indore

 There is also a lot of discussion in the country that there were deep differences between him and Mahatma Gandhi, who was honored as the Father of the Nation
 inamen sabase adhik jis baat par vivaad tha vah tha achhuton kii sthiti
 Gandhi denied that it was necessary to be born in the same caste to help untouchables, backward or Dalits
 isi tarah dow ambedkar ko gandhi ji ke hindutv ke prati gahare anuraag ko lekar dheron ashankaayen thim
 Alam was that Dr
 Ambedkar refused to even consider him a Mahatma
 baavjood iske ki unke bich kitna virodh tha, kai baton main unki mahatma gandhi se samanta bhi thi
 Like Gandhiji, Dr
 Ambedkar too was very interested in writing
 unhone kai digriyaan batori or kai kitaaben yaa to likhin yaa unka sampadan kiya
 His popular books include National Excerpts of India, Castes and Their Mechanization in India, Small Agriculture and Their Treatment in India, Mool Nayak (weekly), Decentralization of Imperial Finance in British India, The Problem of Forms: Origin and Solution, Provincial in British India Emergence of finance, excluded India (weekly), Janata (weekly), caste separation, union vs freedom, views on Pakistan, Mr
 Gandhi and Achu These include the release of 'ranade, Gandhi and Jinnah', 'what Congress and Gandhi did for the untouchables', 'shudra who and how', 'maharashtra linguistic province' and 'lord Buddha and his religion'
 ek dhyaan dene vaali baat yah bhi he ki gandhi or hindutv kii varnavaadi vyavastha se naaraaz dow ambedkar ne jab dharm parivartan kii baat kahi tab mahatma ke aagrah par use na keval lambey samay tak taale rakhaa balki mahatma gandhi ke na hone par bhi unki bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karte hue islam or isiyat kii taraf rukh na kar buddha mat ko tarjeeh di
 Ambedkar adopted Buddhism on October 14, 1956, in the last days of his life
 ve devataaon ke sanjaal ko todakar ek aise mukt manushya kii kalpana kar rahe the, jo dharmik to ho lekin gair-barabari ko jivan mulya na maane
 He died on 6 December 1956
 itnaa lanbaa arsa biit gaya he, par bharat ke in do mahaan sapooton ke sambandh hameshaa charchaa ke centre main rahe
 Ambedkarites and Gandhians have their own arguments and their own interpretation
 unke sambandhon par ab tak kai kitaaben ai hai
 The latest book in Hindi has come from the famous writer Arundhati Roy's name 'ek Tha Doctor Ek Tha Sant'
 jaahir he arundhati ne yah pustak mul rup se angreji main 'da doctor and da saint: cast, res and anihilation of cast: da dibet bitwin biaar ambedkar and em ke gandhi' naam se likhi he

 The enlightened challenge given by Ambedkar to the almost divine image of Gandhi was suppressed by India's elite

 The complaints of corruption and strictures are often made about parties like Bahujan Samaj Party, the same complaints are applied to older political parties on a much larger scale, but when the same allegations are made on the BSP, then the tone of those allegations The screaming is very high and the tone becomes more intense, sharp and insulting
 aisa isliye ki iskaa netaa koi mayawati jaisaa hota he, jo chaar baar uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri rahi hai- ek dalit hai, avivaahit mahila hai, or donon baton par unako fair he
 Whatever the failures of the BSP may have been, but their contribution in awakening and creating Dalit self-respect is a big political task in itself, which should never be underestimated

 From the 1990s, the Government of India opened the box of economic reforms very dramatically

 Today, the value of the total wealth of India's hundred wealthiest people is equal to one-fourth of India's known GDP

 What effect did all these things have on the caste network? Some argue that caste served as a shield for Indian society and saved it from being blunt and blunt as was the case with Western society after the Industrial Revolution

 " Ajmal Kasab's lawyer KP Pawar, while giving his final arguments in the trial on Thursday, said that his client is an innocent village boy who has been made a sacrificial goat in the Mumbai attack case due to being a Pakistani
 pavaar ne vishesh adaalat main kaha, ‘kasaab kaa 26 november ke hamale ke shadyantrkariyon se koi sambandh nahin he
 He was arrested by the police simply because he is Pakistani and according to the police the plot to attack was hatched in Pakistan
 ’ isse pehle, kasaab ne adaalat ke samaksh isi tarah kaa rukh apanaaya tha jab usne adaalat main saakshyon ko darj kiye jane ke baad apana vaktavy diya tha
 Pawar said Kasab had come to Mumbai a fortnight before November 26 and was arrested by police from suburban Juhu Chowpatty area while he was roaming there
 pavaar ne vishesh nyaayadhish em el tahaliani se kaha, ‘kasaab pakistan main ek chote gaanv kaa nirdosh ladkaa he jo police kaa aasaan shikaar or nishaanaa ban gaya
 Pawar said that since all the 10 terrorists who attacked him were killed, the police had to arrest someone to show that a conspirator had been arrested
 unhone kaha, ‘police 35 faraar abhiyukton ko giraftaar karne main sakasham nahin ho saki he or isliye nirdosh vyakti ko nishaanaa bana rahi he
 According to Pawar, the evidence presented by the prosecution on the basis of photographs, CCTV footage and DNA tests is 'fake, fabricated and unreliable'
 magistrate kii adaalat ke samaksh kasaab ke apana aparaadh kaboolne or vishesh adaalat ke samaksh khud ko doshi maan lene ke bare main pavaar ne kaha ki yah police ke dabaav main kiya gaya
 He said, 'the police had assured that he would be given a lesser sentence and if he confessed his guilt he would be transferred from this jail
 ’ pavaar ne baad main daleel di ki police ne kasaab ke khilaaf bayaan dene ke liye gavaahon ko sikhaaya padhaayaa

 dablutio ke 159 sadsy hai or agar iske nae sadsy yaman ko bhi jod len to 160 sadsy hote hai
 Another 23 countries are waiting to join
 dablutio 1 janvari, 1995 se gat kaa uttaradhikari rahaa he, jiske tahat vastuon, sevaaon or bauddhik sampada se jude samjhaute kiye gaye hai
 The WTO is the only forum for multilateral trade liberalization in exchange for regional or bilateral agreements with so many current and prospective members
 dablutio main 575 kshetreey vyapaarik samjhaute (artie) notiphoi kiye gaye hai, haalanki ye saare samjhaute abhi lagu nahin hai
 The regional versus multilateral liberalization debate is decades old
 jab bhi bahupaksheeya samjhauton main tehraav aata he to artie kaa prasar hone lagata he
 While the RTA brings many distortions to relatively small countries (including India), the multilateral approach reduces transaction costs
 isamen vivaadon kaa nibatara aasaan hota he
 Therefore, India should prioritize liberalization under the leadership of the WTO, instead of being sidetracked by efforts such as the Transpacific Partnership (TPP)
 lekin isamen do chetavaniyaan bhi hai
 The first is that liberalization under the leadership of the WTO is still incomplete in everything other than commodities and many rtos are above the WTO
 duusare, dablutio ab bhi urugve daur (1986-1994) ke samjhauton ko hi lagu kar rahaa he
 The general belief is that the WTO is a means of commercial liberalization, but on the contrary there has been no new liberalization through the WTO

 When markets are distorted due to domestic subsidies in developed countries, is it prudent to liberalize agricultural trade? The proposals of reduction in domestic subsidies and tariffs (on agriculture) developed countries have not been acceptable

 We are getting reports that the world economy will get a boost of $ 1,000 billion, and in India this thing is being ridden like a parrot
 aisi sabhi sankhyaon ko andeh kii najar se dekhnaa chahie

 Third, what happened to such numbers that were sprung during the Uruguayan cycle? The numbers at that time did not really change because the spirit of liberalization was not counted by the loopholes present in the law
 isliye turant utsahit hona thik nahin
 In conversation, give this hand and take that hand

 Then comes the trade facilitation facilitation, which was one of the important issues of the 1996 Singapore Conference
 bharat or dakshin america ne vyapaar suvidha sarleekaran ko prakat rup se agenda kaa hissaa sweekaar kar liya he kyonki unki chintaaon ko hal karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The simplification agreements are a good thing and they are not like other issues of the Singapore Conference
 aise main iske samavesh ke virodh kii koi gambhir aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 That $ 1,000 billion figure is only showing the benefits of trade facilitation simplification
 lekin ek baar jab samjhauta lagu ho jayega to bharat ko isaki keemat bhi chukaani padegi or tadnurup sarkaar ke kuch hisson main sudhaar karne honge
 This will need to be done and the external agreement also acts as a catalyst, but this will not be possible without cost and without controversy

 In this film, Kajal Raghavani, the young heartthrob of Bhojpuri, has also sung a number, about which Amrapali Dubey said that good scripts affect face value, because sometimes good films are made, but on posters People distance themselves from the film without seeing a big face

 The issue of Hinduism and Hinduism was discussed at the India Today Conclave with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe
 tharur ne kah ki hindu ek bahut bada dharm he or isamen kai tarah kii dharanaen hai
 But when you begin to define it as a political identity, then it is called Hindutva
 unhone kaha ki vir saavarkar ne hindutv ko ek dharm se zyada nasl ke taur par paribhaashit kiya tha
 He may not have had such a deep faith in religion, but he described it as a symbol of nationalist strength
 tharur ne kaha ki mere liye hindu dharm ek vishwaas he jo sabhi ko khuli dil se sochane kii aazaadee detaa he
 Basically teaches us to accept everyone's perceptions
 hindu dharm sahishnutaa se zyada sweekaar karne kii baat kahata he
 Because tolerance is an idea of patronage, while acceptance tells everyone to respect each other's trust
 lekin hindutv sirf apane hi sach ko hi sahi qaraar detaa he
 Hindutva was misinterpreted, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, National Vice President of BJP, while giving his views on Hindu vs Hindutva, said that Hindutva for me means spiritual democracy
 hindutv main ham ek satya main vishwaas rakhte hai, lekin hindu dharm main vividhtaon kii puri jagah he
 Many people deliberately misinterpret Hinduism
 hindutv ekam sat wipra: bahudhaa vadanti he
 This means that truth is one but the wise call it by many names

 Secretly hoped to meet my favourite hero someday , today i feel super lucky that i did after all these years 
 You are so humble @hrithikroshan, i think i have never been so nervous taking a photo, but i was just so excited thank you for this wonderful memorya post shared by Tamannaah Bhatia (@tamannaahspeaks) on Oct 24, 2017 at 7:07 am PDT koi bhi fal khaane se pehle ham uskaa chhilka utaar phenkate hai
 But according to experts, by doing this, we throw most of the nutrients of the fruits into the garbage
 falon ke chhilkon main ucch maatra main poshak tatv paae jate hai
 If you start eating these peels of fruits also, then the benefit you get will be doubled
 seb, khiraa or santara kuch aise fal hai jo jinke chhilake ko swasth dil or immune system ko behatar banane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 However, there are also peels of some fruits which are very tough and difficult to digest
 aise main salaah ye di jaati he ki inhen kisi or tareeke se istemaal main laayaa jaae
 Here are some such fruits mentioned, eating peel is very beneficial for health: 1
 santare kaa chhilakasantare ke chhilake main bahut saare poshak tatv maujuud hote hai
 If you are able to eat orange peel, then many diseases related to the heart can be avoided
 saath hi yemunh kii badboo ko dur karne or daanton ko swasth rakhane main bhi bahut kargar hota he
 It is also very beneficial in constipation problem
 santare ke chhilake ko sidhe kha paanaa thodaa mushkil he
 If you want, you can use its peel after drying it
 2
 Pomegranate peel is a very effective way to remove pomegranate
 saath hi ye masoodon kii samasya ko dur karne main bhi bahut phydemand he
 It also contains a lot of iron, which is very important for health
 3
 Banana peel is very beneficial
 aapako ye jaanakar shaayad aashcharya ho lekin kele ke chhilake main mul fal se kahin adhik fibre hota he
 Banana peel contains sufficient amount of amino acids
 agar aapako ankhon ke sankraman se judi koi samasya he to kele kaa chhilka khaanaa bahut hi phydemand rahegaa
 4
 tarbooz kaa chhilakakya aap jaanate hai ki tarbooz khaane sebahut jaldi vajan kam hota he
 Although it is difficult to eat its peel in the same form, but if you eat it in pieces like cucumber, it can be eaten comfortably
 5
 Cucumber peels are found in plenty of vitamin a and peel
 ye do vitamin swasthya ke liye bahut hi achche hote hai or saath hi vajan ghataane main bhi kargar hote hai
 It is also very beneficial for strengthening bones
 6
 You may not know the skin of an apple, but the main nutrients of the apple are present in its skin
 flevonoids se bharpoor seb kaa chhilka rog pratirohak kshamta to badhaata he hi saath hi cancer se bachaav bhi karata he
 7
 neembu kaa chhilakaninbu kaa chhilka swasthya ke liye bahut hi acha he
 This disease boosts immunity very quickly
 saath hi isamen kuch aise tatv maujuud hote hai jo cancer se bachaav karte hai
 The anti-oxidants present in it are very beneficial for the skin

 He has been an extremely successful party presidenti am confident that BJP will continue its forward march under Shri Amit Shah's stewardship and reach to newer heights of success and glory Sourav Ganguly may have convinced Indian captain Virat Kohli to play the pink ball test against Bangladesh in Kolkata in just three seconds, but for the new board president to see the Indian team management again in the future to play the 'pink Test' It will not be easy to explain
 dudhia roshni main gulabi gend ko dekhne main pareshanibhartiya team ke sutron ne bataaya ki dudhia roshni main gulabi gend ko dekh paanaa un mukhya chunautiyon main se ek tha, jinka saamana usne kolkata test main kiya
 There is a possibility that the Indian team will oppose the move to play Test with pink ball during future overseas tour
 bisisiai yadi team kii pratikriya letaa he, to khilaadi gulabi se nahin, balki niyamit laal gend se hi khilne kii baat karenge
 The Indian team was worried about the pink ball before the Kolkata day-night test
 vah pink ball test se khilne ke liye khule dimag se maidan par utari bhi
 It is now believed that after gaining the experience of day-night test, Indian players are not in the mood to play day-night test in future
 'drishyata kaa mudda, iske alaava gend bhi sakht thi
 
 
 "A member of the Indian team management told The Indian Express," We felt that the ball was an issue
 drishyata ke alaava gend bhi bahut sakht thi
 See how the Bangladesh batsman got hurt
 fielding ke dauraan bhi gend ko dekhnaa ek chunauti thi
 For bowlers who can bowl at a speed of 140 kmph, it was not easy to handle this ball
 yah gend niyamit laal gend se zyada teji se nikalati he
 To be honest, it was hard to see the pink ball in the milky light
 'gulabi gend kaa baari hona bangladesh ke shivi main bhi ek mudda rahaa
 Some players who were training with pink ball in Indore talked about this
 ab kolkata test ke baad ek bhartiya khilaadi bhi is akalan se sahamat dikhaa
 He also said, 'yes it is very heavy, like a hockey ball
 yah moorkhtapurna hoga yadi ham bhavishya main gulabi gend ke saath aage khelte hai
 'it is noteworthy that Captain Kohli himself said that the pink ball is fast enough in the hands of the fielder
 yah bilkul hockey kii baari ball kii tarah he

 Significantly, Iran's Foreign Minister Javed Zarif visited India on an immediate visit on Monday
 videsh mantralay ke salanaa sammelan main somvaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki bharat ke saath iran ke rishte kisi anya desh dwaara thope gaye pratibandhon se prabhavit nahin honge or donon deshon ke bich vyapaar hota rahegaa

 The author of the book Bij Bhoji is Gaurinath
 yah kitaab kaa atika prakaashan se prakashit hui he
 The first feature of this third collection of stories of Hindi and Maithili storyteller Gaurinath is that the characters of almost all the stories come from the village to the city
 apni jadon kii talash main yaa shahar main rahete hue bhi ve apane gaanv se, uski mitti or uski gandh se mukt nahin ho pate
 From this point of view, notice of mud smell and tarpan can be taken in the diary of an accountant
 inke samanaantar do kahaniyon ke paatr or unka parivesh beshak puri tarah se shahari he lekin unke mukhya paatr kisi dehshat main ji rahe hai
 This panic is of external terror, of light, of the mechanicalness of the city, of which humility is afraid that i am beset with humility and light
 yah dekhakar khushi hoti he ki itane baras dilli main rahane, yaheen rach-bas jane ke baavjood gaurinath apane gaanv-ghar, uski mitti kii gandh ko bilkul nahin bhuule hai
 That is why they have been able to create such characters, which we feel very much
 chaahe vah paimaaish kii sanyasin ho yaa beej bhoji kii maala
 Even after being extremely compassionate, exploited, disreputable, she does not hesitate to abstain from the biggest abuse when the opportunity comes, or to take up her saree even if it is common for her
 in paatro ke bich se guzarate hue hamen baar-baar renu kii kahaniyon main srujit naina jogan, laal paan kii begum yaa raspriya kii mukhya paatr kii yaad aati rahati he
 Little attention has been paid to the fact that Gaurinath repeatedly returns to the myths, folklore, rituals prevalent in his Mithilanchal

 congressi khud maan rahe hai ki congress alaakaman dwaara uttarakhand ko lekar liye gaye nirnay in halaat ke liye jimmedaar hai
 After Satpal Maharaj suddenly joined the BJP, political enthusiasts in Uttarakhand have intensified
 satpal maharaj va unke samarthak pichley lambe arse se khud ko congress main apamaanit mahasoos kar rahe the
 The Congress did many things that caused Satpal Maharaj to drink a sip of insult among the supporters
 pehle satpal maharaj ko party ne pradesh adhyaksh banaaye jane ke sanket die, mahraaj ne badhaaiyaan bhi sweekaar kar leen
 But the high command retreated
 rahi sahi kasar congress aalaa kaman ne uttrakhand kii bandor maharaj ke dhur virdohi harish ravat ko saunp kar puri kar di
 The day the decision was taken in Delhi to hand over the command of the state to Rawat, the countdown of the Congress-led government had started in the state, which culminated in Satpal Maharaj's departure from the Congress
 uttarakhand ke bhaajapa netaa satpal maharaj ke is kadam se khaase prasann hai, ve bhaajapa main maharaj ke aane ko khud kii majbootee maan rahe hai
 There are more than half a dozen mlas in support of Satpal Maharaj, due to which all eyes are on Maharaj's wife Amrita Rawat and his supporters mlas because if they follow Maharaj, Harish Rawat government's farewell is certain
 satpal maharaj ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone se uttarakhand ke congressi sadame main hai
 They hold the Congress high command's policies responsible for these situations, which not only ignored the tall leaders like Satpal Maharaj but also took decisions that made the Congress synonymous with the leaders feel humiliated
 vahiin jab bhaajapa ke varisht netaa khanduri se baat kii to unhone maharaj kia saath hi kaha ki party ne agar koi faisla liya he to wo sahi hoga , Now cyber cafes in East Delhi area can be applied for Health Trade License, Veterinary Trade License, Factory Trade License, Birth Certificate and Death Certificate to be made by the Municipal Corporation
 yahaan bhi vahi fees deni hogi jo nagar nigam charge karata he
 As per the instructions of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, these cyber cafes can charge a maximum of Rs 250 for new license, maximum 150 for renewal of license and maximum Rs 50 for birth or death certificate
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke meyar bipin bihari singh ne kaha ki philhal 18 sibar cafe ko license jari kiya gaya he
 Licenses will also be given to other cafes
 in sibar cafe ko purvi dilli nagar nigam kaa yujar idi or password de diya gaya he taaki wo nigam karmchaaree kii tarah hi logon ko pramaan patr de saken
 This means that you can get a license from home
 saath hi ye bhi daawa kiya he ki isse logon kii suvidha to badhegi hi saath hi kaaphi had tak bhrashtachar par lagaam lagegi

 'fasebuk par yah stats daalane vaali sneha kumari ab is duniya main nahi hai
 Sneha was not a common girl
 vah bihar police main consteble ke pad par tainaat thi
 But he dies and the department finds him two days later
 pita kaa kahana he ki meri beti khubasurat thi or yahi uske maut kaa kaaran bhi he
 The kind of accusations that Sneha's family is making certainly raise doubts about the role of the police
 haalanki sneha kii abhi postmortem report saamne nahin ai he
 Further revelations related to the case may occur only after the postmortem report
 is puure prakaran main police kii bhoomika sandigdh he
 Sneha is part of the same Bihar police, which is making the case a suspect
 aakhir kyon
 The question is who is being tried to save
 sneha kumari siwan jile main tainaat thim lekin 1 june ko uske sarkari quarter main wo mari hui paayi jaati he
 But looking at the condition of the body, it could be said that he would have died 48 hours earlier
 is hisaab se hatya 30 may ko hui
 After all, why did nobody get news about Sneha for two days
 police ne uski maut ko aatmahatya qaraar diya
 The questionable manner in which the case is being tried to hide the case, the suspicion is constantly increasing that the entire police is trying to protect whom
 file photo- sneha kumarisneha kii maut ke baad police ne unke pita ko khabar di ki unki tabiyat kharaab ho gai he, isliye turant siwan aa jaaen
 When the father reaches Siwan from Munger, it is said that Sneha has been sent to Patna
 do pulicekarmi pita ko lekar patna jane ke liye nikalate hai or unhen sidhe munger pahunchaa diya jaataa he
 The postmortem was refused by Siwan's doctors due to a bad body
 jiske baad police ne unke saath marpet kii jisase doctor hadtaal par chale gaye the
 Later Sneha's body was sent to PMCH Patna for postmort
 lekin sneha kii maut main mode tak aayaa jab shav uske paitruk sthaan munger pahunchaa
 The family refused to recognize the body and jammed the highway in a fierce commotion
 police ne sakhti dikhte hue 10 parijanon ko hiraasat main lekar sneha kaa jabaran dah sanskaar karaayaa
 Even the police reached the cremation ground with the dead body
 parijanon ne sneha ke saath dushkarm kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 Sneha's father Vivekananda Mandal says that her daughter's life was taken away by her beauty
 ek bebas pita kaa yah bayaan apane aap main sab kuch bayaan kar rahaa he
 It may be possible that the police department has some power in this whole case, which has been deployed by police from both Siwan and Munger to protect it
 sneha kii maut kaa pataa 1 june ko chalata he or parijanon ko 4 june dah sanskaar ke liye saunpa jaataa he
 File photo- Sneha Kumari, why did it take so long for the police to deliver the body? What else is the negligence of the police? siwan ke espi naveen jha kaa kahana he ki postmortem report aane ke baad hi parijanon ke aaropon par kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the SP of Munger says that there has been no mention of Sneha's body, so her body sample has been sent for DNA test
 shav ko antim sanskaar ke liye parijanon ko soup diya gaya he
 Women got 33 percent reservation in Bihar Police
 isliye mahilaon ko bihar police main naukari kaa acha avasar miltaa he lekin iske vipareet isamen kuch shoshan kii khabaren bhi aati rahati hai
 But what happened to Sneha will only be known from the post mortem report

 Before July 24, 2019, the then Prime Minister Teresa May also resigned from her post after repeatedly failing in Brexit

 Along with this, the UK is suffering a huge loss due to the free visa policy
 lekin isse ulat britain ke kai log yuan se ho rahe phaaydon ke bare main jaanate hai or britain kaa yuan se alag hone ke faisle ko galat bataate hai
 Such as the Conservative Party of Britain and David Cameron of that party, who was the Prime Minister of Britain from 2010 to 2016
 bracit ke virodh main hai
 Because those opposing Brexit know that it will have a bad effect on business from other European countries
 britain kaa single market system khatm ho jayega or britain kii jidipi ko baari nuksaan hoga
 At the same time, both pms after David Cameron (teresa May and Boris Johnson) made Brexit their point and took over as Prime Minister on condition of its implementation
 lekin inamen se terresa me bracit par bahumat hasil nahin kar pain or unhen istipha dena padaa
 At the same time, the government of the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also in danger

 ' 2016 main chhathi baar tamilnadu main satta kii kaman sanbhaalane vaali tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri or annadramuk pramukh jayalalita apane jivan mrityu kii ladaai haar baithi
 Jayaraman Jayalalithaa fought and won many battles in her volatile career
 har baar waapas uth khadey hone or apane nijee evam raajnneetik dushprachaarkon se ladane ke drudh nishchay ke liye pahachaani jane vaali jayalalita kaa janm brahman parivaar main 24 farvari 1948 ko karnataka ke mysore main hua tha
 Jayalalithaa, who made her debut in cinema with the 1956 film Veenira Adai, directed by CV Sridhar, went on to become a popular and popular actress from a teenage actress
 apni maa ke jariye filmon main pravesh ke baad us jamaane ke lokapriy abhinayta em ji ramchandran ke saath unki jodi mashhoor hui
 From 1965 to 1972, he did mostly films with MGR
 lekin iske baad mjiaar se agle 10 saalon tak unka filmi naata nahin rahaa kyonki wo raajnneeti main chale gaye or 1977 main tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri bane
 In 1980, Tamil Nadu was under President's Rule for four months and then elections were held
 mjiaar ek baar phir mukhyamantri bane or mukhyamantritv kaal ke isi duusare daur main mjiaar jayalalita ko raajnneeti main lekar aae, haalanki jayalalita ne hameshaa isse inkaar kiya
 It is necessary to mention here that Jayalalithaa's political career started with the DMK party, which Jayalalithaa has marginalized in Tamil Nadu today
 tamil telugu, kannada or ek hindi film sahit unhone 300 se adhik filmein karne ke baad jayalalita ko mjiaar ne rajyasabha pahunchaaya
 MGR was also very convincing of Jayalalithaa's English and this was the reason behind sending her to Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main jaya 1984-89 tak raheen
 During this time he was also appointed as the Publicity Secretary of the party
 1987 main jab mjiaar ke nidhan ke baad unki party do dhade main bant gai
 Jayalalithaa became the leader of mgr's faction and declared herself the heir to mgr's legacy
 iske baad unka raajnneetik kariyar jo shuru hua wo ab 29 saalon baad unke nidhan ke saath khatm hua
 During this time she was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu six times
 saal 1991 main unhone congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya or rajeev gandhi kii hatya se paidaa hui sahanubhuti kii lahar ne unki party ko baari jeet dilaane main madad kii
 With this, Jayalalithaa took the post of Chief Minister for the first time in 1991
 jayalalita ke naam na keval tamilnadu kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri hone kaa record he balki wo is rajya kii sabase kam umr kii mukhyamantri bhi baniin
 However, a confrontation with his close friend Sasikala's family started in the same period

 The alliance was backed by Tamil superstar Rajinikanth
 iske baad jayalalita ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha or unke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle samet kai maamle darj kar liye gaye the
 Without being distracted by the electoral losses, Jayalalithaa allied with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but she later toppled the Vajpayee-led NDA government in 1999, taking her political stature to the national arena
 saal 1991

 2006 or may 2011 se sitambar 2014 tak mukhyamantri rah chukin jayalalita is dauraan apane kathor faislon ke liye bhi charchaa main raheen
 In 2001, Jayalalithaa once again brought her party to power and during this period, when the government employees went on strike, Jayalalithaa took a historic step and sacked nearly two lakh employees
 isse puraa tamilnadu hill uthaa
 This year he was forced to quit as Chief Minister for some time due to his conviction in the TANSI land case but he did not let it affect the fate of the party
 tab unhone o
 Panneerselvam was posted in its place
 maamle main nirdosh sabit hone ke baad hi unhone paneerselvam se shashan kii kaman waapas lee
 He was convicted and then acquitted in the disproportionate assets case
 aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle ke chalate unke raajnneetik kariyar ke bikhar jane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya tha lekin kambek queen ne ek aise samay par apni vaapasi kii jab unki party 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 Jayalalithaa's withdrawal added a new twist to the opposition's strategy
 2014 sitambar main annadramuk pramukh ko aay se adhik sampatti maamle main doshi tehraaya gaya to vah ek kendriya kanoon ke kaaran swat: hi ayogy ho gayi
 Jayalalitha pledged to face it legally
 maamle main bari hone ke 15 din ke bheetar unhone paanchavin baar mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Jayalalithaa, who was called Puratchi Thalaivi (revolutionary leader), had proved all the calculations of the DMK wrong, according to which the DMK was to gain power in 2011
 us saal jayalalita ne dmdike or vam dalon ke saath gathbandhan karte hue apni party ko shandaar jeet dilaai
 The DMK led by m Karunanidhi could get only 23 mlas
 uske baad se jayalalita ke kad ko tamilnadu main koi chunauti nahin de sakaa kyonki annadramuk ne na sirf sabhi upachunaav or sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav jite, balki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi apni utkrushtataa sabit kii
 The AIADMK, led by Jayalalithaa, gave enough indications of Jayalalithaa's popularity against the Narendra Modi wave in Tamil Nadu by winning 37 out of 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 ammaa kaa kad kis kadar ooncha hua ki dramuk pramukh karunanidhi ke sanket ke baavjood ki unki party gathbandhan karke hi 2016 vidhansabha chunaavon main annadramuk ko chunauti de sakati he, vipaksh 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon tak waapas khadaa nahin ho paaya

 Not only this, according to the law, it is necessary to have a license to fly a kite and in the absence of this there is a provision of fine and punishment of up to 10 lakh rupees

 The government has abolished 1200 laws
 He said that if we cannot be given a license, at least necessary reforms should be made in it so that poor people earning livelihood and kite fliers need not break the law
 aise kai kanoon vartmaan main maujuud hai jinke bare main logon ko jaankaree nahin he
 However, the Modi government at the Center has abolished 1200 such laws in its three-year tenure of inception

 co / zqdvf2luuk — Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) March 22, 2019 National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said that Prime Minister Modi is also not greeted by Pakistani PM Imran Khan when people are being prevented from attending Pakistan National Day program Should be given agar aisa hota to ham pakistan ke saath apane rishton ko lekar itane uljhe hue nahin dikhte
 If only the spooks & other interested players stopping people from attending the Pak National Day event had also stopped PM Modi from sending his greeting to PM Khan we would not look so damn confused about our relations with Pakistan

 Pakistani High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood said on the eve of Pakistan's National Day that the release of Wing Commander Abhinandan, the return of both the High Commissioners to their missions and bilateral talks on the Kartarpur Corridor are steps in the right direction
 bataa den ki bharat ne pakistan ke rashtriya diwas par dilli ucchayog main yojit kaarykram kaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla liya tha

 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, bharat ne shuukravaar ko hone vaale pakistan rashtriya diwas samarohon main kisi bhi pratinidhi ko nahin bhejne kaa faisla kiya he
 The Pakistan High Commission decided to invite Hurriyat Conference representatives to the ceremony and India made the decision thereafter

 India's first photo realistic motion capture film 'kochadeyaan' is set to release soon
 film main rajnikant lead role main hai
 On the other hand, actor Imran Khan associated with the animation film 'rio' is praising the makers of 'kochadeyaan'
 ve unki is damdaar koshish kii khub tarif kar rahe hai ki unhone bharat main is tarah kii technology kaa istemaal karke film banane kii koshish kii he
 Imran says, "kochadeyaan will be a big leap in the world of animation films
 agar aap das saal peeche najar daalen to yah hollywood main bhi badi baat thi
 But it dominated Hollywood in the last 10–12 years and became a part of mainstream cinema
 hamen bhi ise thodaa bahut samay dena hoga
 a big star like Rajinikanth sir coming into the field of animation is a big step
 is tarah kii cheez anya logon ko bhi prerit karegi
 If they can do it then we can too
 ’ "" After seeing the situation, the situation changed so fast for actress Tanushree Dutta and so that her career has come to a standstill
 unhen khud bhi yaad nahin hoga ki unki aakhri film koun-si thi, jise thikthak bhi respance mila hoga
 The smile on Tanushree's face has returned, Tanushree's smile has returned to her face, because after a while, she is found in a new film which has started shooting, but Tanu is still reluctant to talk about it
 
 ek baar film puri ho jaae, to unhen tasalli ho jaaegi ki film ban chuki he
 Now if Tanushritanushree is not doing big things, then the reason for this is clear that some time ago she was on the seventh sky with a film called 'rama o Rama', but time passed and this film went somewhere

 chhattisgarh main prativarsh karodon paudhe ke ropan hone ke baavjood 15 varshon main chhattisgarh main jangal kam ho gaye hai
 In Chhattisgarh, the forests have decreased in the last 15 years instead of growing
 jabaki salanaa barish ke mausam main 500 karod se zyada kii rakam plantesan main kharch kii jaati he
 Every year the forest department claims that it is planting more than one crore saplings
 lekin ye paudhe kahaan lag rahe hai yah rahasy bana hua he
 The state high court has also issued a notice asking the forest department where the plants are growing
 or lag rahe hai to jangal kaa rakabaa kyon ghat gaya
 Actually despite the plantation, the forest has reduced by about 3700 sq km from 2001 to 2015
 iskaa khulaasa sarkaar kii report main hua he
 After the High Court notice is issued to investigate the matter, the top officers of the Forest Department are peeping at the issue
 darasal rajya main 8-10 saalon main sirf kaagajon main paudha ropan hua
 And the amount spent on it went to the coffers of officers
 RTI kaaryakartaaon ke mutabik afasaron ne paudha ropan ke naam par 15 sau karod se zyada kii rakam dakaar lee
 In Tochtisgarh, every year, from schools to forests, Environment Day is celebrated vigorously
 VIP kii maujuudagi main plantesan kaa kaarykram bhi khub hota he
 After planting a few plants, the forest department releases data that it has planted more than one crore saplings in four months of rain
 paudha ropan kaa yah target fiks hota he
 These plants are planted from urban areas to rural areas
 iske alaava jangalon main bade paimaane par paudha ropan kaa daawa kar van vibhaag apni peeth thapthapaata he
 From 2001 to 2015, in the state, Harihar Chhattisgarh scheme, sometimes Mukhyamantri Bari Bamboo scheme, and sometimes it was described as planting of crores of plants in the name of oxygen zone
 in varshon main van vibhaag ne paudha ropan ke naam par karodon rakam kharch kar di, lekin wo paudhe naa to jangalon main dikhaai die or naa hi aabaadi se dur khuli bastiyon main
 So the question arises as to where did these plants go? In the name of planting saplings in the state, the Forest Department is accusing the forest department of grabbing thick money
 RTI kaaryakartaaon ne ghotaale ke puure sakshya chhattisgarh hai court ko saunpe hai
 On this, the High Court has asked the Forest Department for full details of plantation within three weeks
 RTI kaaryakarta rakesh choube ke mutabik harier chhattisgarh ke naam se pradesh main ek bada ghotaalaa hua he
 This includes top officials of the forest department and even ministers
 unke mutabik RTI se mili tamaam dastavejon ko hai court ne parkhaa
 Then issued notice to the Forest Department asking for complete details of the plantation
 unhone maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kii
 On the other hand, the state forest minister Mahesh Gagda has confirmed that the area of forests has decreased on a large scale
 isaki jaanch ke liye unhone van vibhaag kii team gathit karne ke nirdesh die hai
 8 crore 2 lakh saplings have been planted under Harihar Chhattisgarh 2017
 2016 main 7 karod 60 lakh paudhe lagaae gaye the
 And in 2015 10 crore saplings were planted
 chhattisgarh nirmaan ke pashchaat lagataarvriksharopanhone ke baavjood varsh 2001 se 2015 tak lagbhag 3700 varg kimi jangal kam ho gaya he
 Now the eyes of the people are focused on the response of the forest department
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik, garmiyon main hi vriksharopan ke liye gadde khod liye jane chahie
 Trees should be maintained for 3 years
 van vibhaag ne 2013 main nirdesh die the ki har haalat main 20 july tak vriksharopan kaary purna ho janaa chahie
 In case of rainy or odd conditions, plantation can be done till 31 July, but permission will have to be taken from the headquarters for that
 lekin kabhi bhi van vibhaag ne apane in nirdeshon ke paalan koi jaankaree nahin di
 Neither dug pit for planting saplings in summer nor in rainy season
 gadde unhi jagahon par khode gaye, jahaan VIP or jan pratinidhiyon ko paudha ropan karnaa tha

 Hearing the news of Maria's death on Thursday, her family mourned
 unki maa farida juberi ne bataaya ki maaria bachapan se hi payalat bananaa chaahati thim or apni lagan va mehnat se unhone ise puraa bhi kar liya tha, lekin is baat kaa kisi ko andaja nahin tha ki yahi khwaahish unki maut kaa sabab ban jaaegi
 Maria will be cremated in Mumbai itself
 haadase main maari gai ejeeniyar ke parivaar ne uthaae sawaalvahin is haadase kaa shikaar huin engineyar surabhi gupta ke parivaar waalon ne sawaal uthaate hue poocha he ki company ne kharaab sthiti vaale chartered ko udaane kii ijaajat kyon di? unhone maang kii he ki maamle kii jaanch ke baad doshiyon par kadi karrwai kii jaae
 Surabhi's father said that he had a conversation with the phone person before the accident, in which he mentioned that his team is working on a test drive on a plane which is very old and decaying
 surabhi ke pita ne maang kii he ki is puure maamle kii jaanch ho or haadase ke doshi logon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai ho
 Surbhi Gupta was a flight engineer in Chartered, who was a victim of the accident last year

 Her family lives in Sonepat while she herself lived in Mumbai with her husband and was a flight engineer with a private plane company

 After the plane crash, the biggest question that comes up is that the plane was very old and it had many shortcomings, despite which it was allowed to fly
