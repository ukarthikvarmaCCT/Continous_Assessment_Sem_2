 Obviously, my knowledge of rural realities was absolutely zero
 haryana ke bare main meraa anubhav dilli main kaam karne vaale vahaan ke pulicekarmiyon tak simit tha, lekin is naukari ne mujhe hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 i came to know about the real India issues and its problems settled in the villages
 haryana meri pehle kii raay ke ulat yah ek shandaar rajya tha, jise 1965 main punjab ke sabase pichde ilaakon ko alag karke banaaya gaya tha
 At that time, it was believed that this state would not be able to succeed much and it would not be able to give salary to its employees either
 lekin paanch saal ke andar yah rajya puure desh main pehle number kaa rajya ban gaya, jiskaa sara shrey uske damdaar netaa or tatkaaleen mukhyamantri choudhary bansilaal ke kushal netritv or vahaan kii mehanatakash naukarshahi ko jaataa he
 Haryana flagged off in every area of development
 safalataa kii is kahani ke peeche ek doordarshee netaa kaa haath tha, jise ek athak naukarshahi kaa puraa sahyog mila
 If i talk about the early years, corruption in the administrative service was negligible
 lekin kuch varshon ke baad shuru hui giravat jald hi belgaum hoti chali gai
 The bureaucratic focus shifted away from functioning to personal loyalty to leaders
 shuru main jab maine janaa ki hamaare kuch saathi raste se bhatak rahe hai to isse hamen zyada chintaa nahin hui
 We thought that moral standards vary from people to people
 lekin jab yah hamaare puure varg kii pratishtha par daag lagane laga to hamen chaukanna hona padaa
 Then the IAS Association of UP took a historic step to hold an election within itself so that the corrupt elements could be identified and brought before the people
 har kisi se teen sabase zyada bhrasht adhikariyon ke naam bataane ke liye kaha gaya
 Initially, many objected to this, but it proved to be an effective way of identifying corrupt bureaucrats
 iske baad logon ne eemaandaar or bhrasht ke bich antar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Many political leaders have suffered this "steel frame" of administration
 unhone sahyog na karne vaale adhikariyon ko hatotsahit karne or unki qamar todgaye ke liye tabadale ko apane hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kiya
 In states like UP, every term of the District Magistrate and SP has been a few months, if not a few discrepancies
 isse un adhikariyon kaa parivaar pareshaan hota tha
 Every few months, due to the difficulties of moving the family from one place to another and enrolling in a new school for children, many officials started getting ready to bow before the leaders
 kuch ne aasaani se haar maan lee to kuch ne thode naa-nukur ke baad
 But civil society and media were silent at that time
 jisase bhrasht log taqatvar ho gaye, or eemaandaar va siddhantvaadi log haashie par pahunch gaye
 Getting into civil service is not easy
 har saal lakhon yuva kareeb 1,000 naukariyon ke liye apni ankhon main sapana liye pratiyogita main baithte hai
 Many people name it a national hobby
 aaazaad bharat ke shuruaati varshon main civil seva kii pariksha main sirf kala or saamaajik vishyon ke chaatr hi hissaa le sakate the, kyonki mana jaataa tha ki unki samaj zyada vyapak hoti he
 But later this competition was opened to students of all disciplines, in which engineers, doctors, cas, everyone can participate
 aisa hone se pratiyogita or bhi mushkil ho gai
 For most people, human service was still the inspiration behind it
 lekin kuch ke liye yah fatafat amir banane kaa avasar tha
 Due to the declining reputation of this service, people began to address its officials, even senior officers, with derogatory words of "babu"
 logon main aam raay yah he ki naukarshahi aksham or bhrasht he
 Certainly this is not a true portrayal of the talent and character of most officers
 hamaari civil sevaaon, jinamein iees, ipies or rajasav sevaayen aati hai, kii kshamtaaon kaa sabase bada pradarshan tab dekhne ko miltaa he jab ve chunaavon ke prabandh main shaamil hote hai
 These elections are not only the largest in the whole world, but also the largest event managed by humans
 bharat ke chunaavon kii puri duniya main tarif hoti he
 Hillary Clinton called it the Gold Standard
 logon ko shaayad pataa nahin he ki yah puraa prabandhan civil seva ke adhikari hi sambhalate hai, yani 1 karod 10 lakh sarkari karmchaaree isamen jutate hai
 The question is how the establishment, which is considered inefficient and corrupt, works so efficiently during the elections
 iskaa rahasy yah he ki tab iskaa sanchaalan chunaav ayog ke haath main hota he, jo yah jaanata he ki unase kaise badhibia kaam liya jaataa he
 Prune the good from the corrupt and incompetent, save the honest from political pressure and then see the result
 chunaav ayog sunishchit karata he ki ve bhaymukt hokar eemaandaaree se kaam karen or desh kaa gaurav badhayen
 Civil service work is not praised nor does it get any reward for its work on normal days
 unke liye koi padmashri nahin he
 They are never rewarded for good work
 haa, police adhikariyon ko veerta puraskaar jarur die jate hai, lekin vah bhi utane nahin hai, jitne ke ve hakdaar hote hai
 Later, the Prime Minister's award was given to some of them
 chunaav ayog ne bhi nae prayogon or achche kaamkaaj ke liye puraskaar shuru kiye hai jinase unka manobal badhata he

 The nature which had caused havoc in Uttarakhand earlier in the week has now reached a new phase
 uttarakhand main mausam phir sankat banakar saamne aayaa he
 Relief works have been hit by rain
 uttarakhand ke kai ilaakon main somvaar raat se barish ho rahi he
 It is raining in Dehradun, Rishikesh, Gochar and Guptkashi
 mausam vibhaag ne aaj se 28 june tak uttarakhand ke vibhinn ilaakon main barish kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 Rescue operation will be affected by rain
 somvaar ko bhi mausam kharaab hone se rescue oparation baadhit hua tha
 At present, 6000 people are stranded in various areas of the state
 lekin mausam saaf hone tak helicopter kaa udana mushkil he, aise main hajaaron jindagi ko khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 The Meteorological Department had already predicted that there will be rain in Uttarakhand from Monday, which will intensify from Tuesday i
e
 today
 anumaan ke mutabik hi der raat se uttarkashi, gangotri or harsil ilaake main barish ho rahi he
 Dehradun, Pauri and Chamoli districts have also been receiving intermittent rains since Monday
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik mangalvaar ko uttarakhand ke chaar dhaamon- gangotri, yamunotri, kedarnath, badrinath or hemkund sahib main ilaake main 40 se 70 mem barish ho sakati he
 Obviously, this will affect the rescue operation because it is difficult to fly helicopters in the rain and low visibility
 agar helicopter udaan nahin bharenge to durgam ilaake main fanse logon ko surakshit jagahon par nahin pahunchaaya ja sakegaa kyonki barish or bhuskhalan se sadaken nasht hone kii vajah logon ko nikaalane kaa ekmaatr saadhan hawaii maarg hi he
 Significantly, due to bad weather, the rescue operation was interrupted for the whole day on Monday
 somvaar ko kitne logon kaa rescue kiya gaya ise lekar do tarah ke bayaan saamne aa rahe hai
 a statement issued by PIB from Delhi said that out of about 10 thousand people stranded in various places, about three thousand people could be evacuated on Monday
 inamen sena ne 1375 logon ko bachaaya, jisamen 368 log harsil se nikaale gaye or baaki badrinaath se
 The road from Harsil to Uttarkashi has been fixed
 log paidal uttarkashi tak pahunch sakate hai
 The IAF deployed 135 ferries to evacuate 1095 people from Harsil, while ITBP evacuated four and a half hundred from Badrinath and 267 from Gangotri Maneri
 andiaref ne harsil se 120 logon kaa rescue kiya
 According to the NDRF, all the people who survived in Kedarnath and Bhairon Chetti area have been evacuated
 is hisaab se maane to ab kareeb saat hajaar logon kaa rescue hi baaki he
 But, the Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand claims that only four thousand are truly trapped there
 itibipi ke mutabik agar mausam saath de to teen din ke bheetar rescue oparation puraa ho saktaa he lekin mausam vibhaag kii maane to 28 june tak mausam khulne ke koi asaar nahin hai
 The question arises that how will thousands of lives be saved, who are still in trouble even nine days after the orgy of nature
 kapil sharma ke kamedi sho main is weekend kamedi se zyada raajnneetik rang dekhne ko mili
 The reason for this is the entry of Judge Navjot Singh Sidhu in the show and Manoj Tiwari's entry as a guest
 donon ne sho main shirkat kii or ek-duusare ko taane bhi maare
 On Saturday, BJP leaders Manoj Tiwari, Sunil Shetty, Bhojpuri cinema star Dinesh Lal Yadav came to promote the Nirhua Cricket League on the show
 isi dauraan siddhu or manoj bajpeyi ke bich takaraar bhi dekhne ko mili
 As Manoj Tiwari came on the show, Siddhu was welcomed by the lion
 iske baad sho main baccha yadav (kiku sharada) ne manoj tiwari or navjot singh siddhu ke bare main kaha ki donon main ek samanta he
 The two are holding four tasks together
 kapil sharma ne poocha koun se kaam to baccha yadav ne kaha ki actor hai, manoj ji netaa hai or singer hai, ab cricketer bhi ho gaye hai
 Kapil Sharma said that these three works were done, what is the fourth work
 is par baccha yadav kahata he ki netaa log hai teen kaa chaar bataanaa hi padataa he
 On this, Manoj Tiwari did not remain silent and pointed towards Sidhu and said - all this used to go on before 2014
 ye sunakar sho main maujuud guest hansane lage 
 But Siddhu gives a befitting reply to this stance saying that whatever is wrong will be correct after 2019

 Apart from this, the three leaders also discussed the issue of maritime security and connectivity
 teenon deshon ke bich pehali tripaksheeya mantri stareey baithak varsh 2015 main hui thi
 The meeting is being held at the level of senior officials since 2011
 pakistan ne bharat se kaha he ki vah kashmir par apni ‘gaiyr-lacheelee’ niti main badlaav laaye
 Pakistan claimed that Jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India and the issue cannot be resolved within the ambit of the Indian Constitution
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa abdul basit ne ek tivi channel se kaha ki bharat ko kashmir mudde par apana najariya or niti badalanaa hogi
 He said, "when there will be a change in the non-flexible Indian policy in the past, then the dialogue between the two countries will prove to be beneficial
" ’’ basit ne kaha ki kashmir samasya antarrashtriya str par pahachaanaa ja chukaa mudda he or sanyukt raashtra ne iske samaadhaan ke liye prastaav bhi paarit kiya he
 He claimed that the Kashmir issue has to be resolved in accordance with the 'aspirations' of the Kashmiri people
 pakistan ne bharat ke saath visheshkar kashmir samasya sahit sabhi mudde hameshaa se shantipurna tareeke se sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Basit alleged that India has been using hard force in Jammu and Kashmir since last June
 pakistan chahta he ki bharat dwaara atyaachaar band ho
 In response to a question, he said that both countries have been discussing the Kashmir issue for decades
 samgr vaarta prakriya main yah mudda agenda main sheersh par tha lekin bharat ne kabhi bhi is mudde ko sulajhane kii gambhirtha se koshish nahin kii
 He said, "whenever the dialogue process is restored, we hope that India will adopt a realistic approach

 haldwani main enech 87 ke chaudeekaran kii prakriya shuru hone ke baad 14 hajaar se bhi adhik hare pedo ko kaatane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he, lekin isse paryaavaran premi aahat hai
 It is believed that if there is human life on the earth then climate is a big reason for it and the main reason for that climate is trees, plants and vegetation
 vishwa main lagaataar global verming or jalwaayu parivartan ke chalate sabhi desh ekajute hokar paryaavaran kii girti sthiti ko dekh lagaataar chintit log baithak kar apni paryaavaran ko bachaane ke liye ek saath kaam kar rahe hai
 It is also natural for people to be worried, because the situation in the country's capital Delhi at this time, it can be estimated that in the days to come, the crisis on the environment may be deepened, but the authorities still do not learn lessons from these conditions
 are
 taaja maamla uttarakhand ke haldwani tarai kendriya van prabhag kaa he jahaan enech 87 ke chaudeekaran kaa kaary joro par he
 How concerned the government itself is about the widening of NH 87 in Uttarakhand can be gauged from the fact that not a single tree has been planted so far to compensate thousands of giant trees cut for NH widening
 darasal rudrapur se kathgodam tak hajaaron pedo ko kaatane kii parmishan van vibhaag ne bina ped lagaae hi van nigam ko de di, jisamen se van nigam ne sadak ke donon kinaaron main kaam shuru karte hue 80 fisadi hare pedo ko kaat bhi diya
 National Highway 87 from Rampur to Kathgodam is being converted into a four line, which is about 93 kilometers in length
 rudrapur se kathgodam tak ye duuri lagbhag 40 kilometre he jisamen se adhikansh kshetra van vibhaag kaa he, jisamen enech ke chaudeekaran ko lekar chote bade lagbhag 15 hajaar se adhik hare pedo ko kaata jayega
 Environmentalists are seen hurting due to the cutting of big green trees
 vanaspati visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki jis raftaar se uttarakhand main sadakon kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he or un sadakon ke kinare lage hare pedo ko kaata ja rahaa he usase paryaavaran asuntalan hone kii sambhaavna or adhik bad gai he
 According to experts, there are many trees which have become the identity of small towns and cities, but even after the start of the project, the planting of new trees instead of trees is a matter of concern for the environment
 
 van vibhaag ke mutabik enech 87 kii bhent chadh rahe 14488 pedo par chapai kar van nigam ko kaatane ke liye saunp die hai
 About 80 percent of the work has also been completed
 in pedo kii kshatipurti ke liye tarai kendriya van prabhag main jameen talash lee gai he lekin paudhe lagane ke liye paisa abhi nahin aayaa he
 According to him, as soon as the money comes to the forest department, the process of planting trees will be started
 diefo tarai kendriya van prabhag ne kaha ki, ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega ki kya jo 14 hajaar pedon kii bali sadak banane ke liye lee gai unki jagah naye paudhon ko mil paaegi yaa nahin
 Due to increasing pollution, where the capital of Delhi is in a bad condition every day, one thing is clear from it that in the coming days, the environment is going to be very bad
 enech 87 ke chaudeekaran ke liye bhi jis tarah hare pedo ko kaatane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he usase yah mana ja saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main uttarakhand main pradooshan kaa vahi haal hone vaala he jo abhi desh kii rajdhani dilli kaa he
 Aadhaar card, which is prepared in a biometric manner, can be made by a man with different names

 But a man was cheating a private finance company by financing expensive electronic items through fake basis

 You will also be stunned by the actions of this vicious person who was caught by the police
 kabhi vah gaurav kukereja ban jaataa tha to kabhi vah yogesh sharma ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In fact, this man caught in the police was cheating the finance company for millions of rupees by getting him to finance electronic items
 showrooms se liye gaye saamaan ko yah oune-paune daamon par bech rahaa tha
 If the EMI was not deposited on time, the finance company researched the details of the accused, then it was found that the photo is of the same person in all the Aadhaar cards used at the time of finance, but the name and address are separately recorded in it
 finance company kii shikaayat par police ne jaal bichhaakar aaropee ko dhar dabocha
 Initially, the accused misled the police but after strictly interrogation, he confessed his crime
 aaropee ke paas 10 se adhik aadhaar card baraamad hue hai, jisame sirf photo uskaa he magar naam or pataa alag-alag darj he
 All these Aadhaar cards were created in a fake way
 gauratlab he ki aadhaar card ko pukhta pramaan patr maanate hue finance companiyaan turant lone apruv kar detii hai
 Taking advantage of this, the accused was cheating the finance company of millions of rupees

 com / 7fpj0rx9ml— Matt Dowell (@themattdowell)december 30, 2017 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said on Saturday that Maneka Gandhi had insulted her by raising the question of motherhood for which Maneka should apologize
 mayawati ne ye bhi kaha ki menka ne agar bete ko sahi sanskaar die hote to varun aaj seenkhchon ke peeche nahin hote
 Maneka Gandhi said on Friday that if Mayawati was a mother, she could understand the pain of a mother
 darasal, varun gandhi eta jail main hai
 When Maneka came to meet him, the jail administration did not allow him to meet his son, citing law and order
 mukhyamantri mayawati ne kaha he ki varun gandhi parivaar se hai to kya hua, upi main kisi ko kaanoon-vyavastha se khilwaad nahin karne diya jayega
 No matter how big a person he may be
 menka ko jawaab dete hue unhone ye bhi kaha ki varun kii maa ko sirf apane bete kaa khyaal he
 If the administration in Pilibhit did not take the right action on time, then Varun's provocative speech could have sparked riots across the country, and if it had happened, the number of mothers lost could have been lost

 The set of the film 'mughal-e-azam' kept the interest of people in the studio for many years after the release of the film and many famous foreign celebrities were also among those who watched it
 ab film 'sholay' se logon ke jazbaati lagaav ko dekhte hue karnataka sarkaar ke paryaton mantralay ne ek mahatvakankshi yojana banaai he
 About 70 km from Bangalore, near the Bangalore Mysuru Highway, in Ramanagaram, a natural set should be made again at the place where most of Sholay was shot
 yani yojana film 'sholay' ke gaanv ramgarh ko dubaara basaane kii he
 Whether it is Gabbar Singh's hideout or Thakur's Haveli or Veeru and Jai's Ashiana and Ramanagaram station, all to encourage tourism, as well as memories of a fantastic film, always fresh
 tippaniyan Along with all this there will be 3-D holographic representation
 yani 'sholay' ke kuch yaadgaar seen aapako apane aas-paas ghatit hote dikhenge, thik usee tarah jaise 2014 ke aam chunaav ke dauraan narendra modi ek saath kai jagahon par chunavi sabha karte dikhte or aisa lagata jaise wo saamne khadey hon
 That is, along with Gabbar Singh, Basanti will be seen running around you with his dhanno
 karnataka main paryaton mantri priyank khadge ne bataaya ki is project par lagbhag 7 karod 50 lakh ke kharch aane kaa anumaan he
 Although the approval of the government is yet to be received, they are hopeful that there will be no hurdle in it
 kyonki iskaa khaas khyaal rakhaa jayega ki vahaan ke ichological system par is project kii vajah se avyavasthit na ho

 kyonki iskaa khaas khyaal rakhaa jayega ki vahaan ke ichological system par is project kii vajah se avyavasthit na ho
 In Karnataka, Tourism Minister Priyank Kharge said that the project is expected to cost about 70 million rupees
 haalanki sarkaar kii manjuuri abhi milani he lekin unhen puri ummid he ki isamen koi aadchan nahin aegi
 Because special care will be taken that the ecological system there is not disturbed by this project
 narendra modi sarkaar ke aakhri purnabajatko lekar romanchit hone jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he
 In fact, the budget of 2018 will take us into the era of such budgets in the country, in which there will be no enthusiasm about the budget
 ho saktaa he meri yah baat thodi vicitra lag rahi ho kyonki 1 farvari ko aane vaale bajet ko lekar kayaason kaa daur chal padaa he
 The fact is that the consumer coefficient is going to be the cipher in the budget and electoral politics will prove effective on policy issues, so the point of view on February 1 will be Arun Jaitley's fiscal arithmetic only
 aaie, isse pehle ki ham bajet ke din phuggon par itaraane lagen, kuch tathyon par nigaah daal lete hai
 For the cipher consumers, till now people waited for the budget because changes were made in excise and service tax along with other things
 dilachasp he ki apratyaksh karon main salanaa sudhaaron kii puraani parampara ke ulat, ab, jiesti council har maheene ek mini bajet lekar aa rahi he
 After GST, there is very limited scope for changes in Custom Duty and Income Tax in the budget
 baharhaal, sarkaar ke liye rajasav ugaahi ke strot sookhte ja rahe hai, aise main ykardaataaon ke liye bajet main koi badi chhot milane kii sambhaavna bhi dhoomil hi dikh rahi he
 Since GST has taken the right to levy taxes from the states, the budgets of the states will be nothing but the exercise of filing the balance sheet
 baharhaal, vishleshkon or saarvajanik vitt ke utsaahiyon ke liye, jiesti ke baad rajasav hasil karne kaa dhaancha or rajyon ke saath iskaa bantwaaraa agle bajaton kii nai saamagree hogi
 In the budget of the government, when the finance minister announced the big allocations, his tone would get louder, and the rest of the members thumped the table and welcomed it
 lekin is saal sarkaar ke paas aisi ghoshnaaon ke liye kuch khaas nahi hai
 The government is trying to be a little frugal because of the reduction in GST revenue and compensation given to states due to GST
 sarkaar ko asal main apane kharchon main katautee karne ke liye baadhya hona padaa he, jisamen behad jaruri puunji main katautee bhi shaamil he
 This reduction was observed in august-september 2017 to reduce the fiscal deficit
 bajet taiyaar karne kii prakriya ke dauraan aa rahi reports bataa rahi hai ki 2018-19 main railway ko die jane vaale aavanton main 27 fisadi kii kami kii ja sakati he
 Government spending was the last hope for an economy struggling with a decline in private investment and consumption, and the shortfall is bad news
 vittiya prabandhan kii baat karen to rajya sarkaron ke bajet par bhi iske dushprabhav dikhenge
 States have already reduced the pace of capital expenditure to recover from the deficit
 2018-19 ke vitt varsh main 17 rajyon ne apni puunjigat kharchon main 10-25 fisadi tak kii kami kii he
 There is nothing for consumers in the Big Number budget
 aise main bajtiy ghaataa hi sabase dilachasp aankada sabit hoga
 Jaitley has so far successfully held this front
 phir bhi, apane aakhri bajet main rajkoshiya giravat aparyaapt jiesti rajasav ugaahi, bhartiya reserve bank se mili aparyaapt labhaansh or ummid se kam rahe jidipi vikaas dar kii vajah se jor-shor se dikhenge
 In the half-yearly fiscal policy released along with last year's budget, the government stated that the fiscal deficit for FY 2018 was 3 of GDP
 2 fisadi or vitt varsh 2019 ke liye 3 fisad tak laane kaa lakshya he
 But the target of disinvestment (rs 725 billion)
 ke lakshya kii tulana main ab tak 543 arab ru
 ), Even after the shocking performance, the government may incur a financial deficit of 10 to 30 bps in FY 2018
 ghate main is khatarnaak badhotaree ko thaamne ke liye sarkaar saarvajanik kshetra ke upakramon ko atirikt labhaansh dene ke liye raji karne kii koshish main he
 The government may further increase its disinvestment targets for FY 2018 and 2019
 aise main, maujuuda varsh ke lakshya-725 arab- ko paaya ja sakegaa balki isi strot se agle saal ke lakshya bhi pur kii koshish kii jaaegi
 In the context of FY 2019, the government's target 3
 2 fisadi vittiya ghate kaa rahane vaala he, jabaki pehle yah 3 fisad rahane vaala tha
 After all, in the election year its expenses will increase
 is bajet se logon ko ummid thi ki modi sarkaar 2019 ke liye chunavi abhiyaan main jutane se pehle joardaar ghoshnaaen karegi
 However, the budget of 2018 will be a vanguard of new age budgets - these budgets will be more important to economists than to people

 khandelwal ne vitt mantri se jiesti ke tahat vibhinn kar slab ke tahat rakhi gai vastuon kii samiksha karne kaa aagrah kiya, kyonki vibhinn kar slab main shaamil anek vasteen ek-duusare par overlap kar rahi hai
 He also said that as a policy the tax rate of raw materials should not exceed the tax rate of finished goods
 vibhinn vasteen jaise auto parts, aluminium bartan aadi jo vilasita kii vasteen nahin hai, inhen 28% kar slab se nikaala janaa chahie or inhen kam kar slab ke tahat rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Praveen Khandelwal also urged the Finance Minister to simplify Forms GSTR 9 and 9C, as this form asks for various types of details which were not previously prescribed in the tax system and hence traders are unable to comply with it
 khandelwal ne kaha ki mul ghoshnaa ke anusaar, gaiyr banking vitt companiyon or micro finance sansthaanon ko vyapaariyon ko vitt dene ke liye mudra yojana main shaamil kiya janaa chahie or bainkon ko enbiensi or emenai ko vitt dene ke liye kaha janaa chahie
 Welcoming the waiver of bank charges on NEFT and RTGS, Khandelwal suggested that to encourage adoption and acceptance of digital payments, bank charges levied on card payments were given by the government directly as subsidies to banks
 Go so that merchants and consumers do not incur bank charges on card payment transactions
 unhone vitt mantri se prayek rajya or centre main jiesti lokapal gathit karne kaa bhi aagrah kiya
 Finance Minister Sitharaman assured the delegation that she would take necessary steps after carefully reviewing the issues raised by CAT
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar kaa iraadaa nishchit rup se kar prakriya ko saral bananaa he taaki adhik se adhik log aasaani se uskaa anupaalan kar saken
 The merchant community plays an important role in the collection of revenue and it is the endeavor of the government not to face any undue hardship to the traders

 cat ne yah bhi kaha he ki form itisi -04 kaa unmoolan ho tathaa expyri date kii dawaaon kii vaapasi ko bhi supplai mana janaa chahie
 In its white paper, Kat covered hardware, mobile covers, foods, dry fruits, ice cream, food grains, malt, cereal-based food drinks, paints, marble, used vehicles, two-wheelers, agricultural equipment, roasted chickpeas, etc
 Also urged to remove the current tax slab and keep it at a lower tax rate

 The real issue is that i was born in this family, it was not my choice
 maine dastakhat nahin kiye the ki main is parivaar main paidaa hona chaahunga
 i am against the concept of dynasty
 bijepi diemke or espi main bhi vanshavaad he, congress main bhi he
 It will take time to overcome it
 kya aapako sachmuch lagata he ki raajnneeti se khandaan yaa vanshavaad kabhi dur hoga
 Has its roots deepened overnight
 isiilie meraa aaj sawaal he ki yah mudda kisalie hai
 To target Rahul Gandhi or to remove Indian politics from dynasty
 kya rahul gandhi kaa maamla isliye sangeen he kyonki ve aae or aate hi parivaar ke naam par pradhanmantri ke daavedaar ban gaye yaa isliye he ki vanshavaad hamaari raajnneeti ko khaae ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is serious about the post or the issue of occupation of the Chief Minister or Parliamentary seats is equally serious
 phir kyon jammu-kashmir main abdulla parivaar he jisase congress or bijepi donon haath milaate rahe hai
 Then why there is a Badal family in Punjab, which is an ally of the BJP, then why there are Yadav families in UP with which the Congress joins hands, then why there are Yadav and Paswan families in Bihar with which the Congress ties up
 phir kyon maharashtra main thakare parivaar he, jisase bijepi haath milaati he
 Then why there is a Scindia family in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which is also in Congress, is in BJP
 kuch parivaar to badhate hi ja rahe hai
 Like the family of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar, ramvilas paswan kaa parivaar
 Political parties are also being divided among the brothers in the same way as they divide farms and houses in big families

 Father Karunanidhi has expelled his son Alagiri as he revealed to his father the possibility of his brother Stalin dying

 In relation to Badal family in Punjab, when i spoke to Professor Ashutosh of Punjab University, he said that as Mughal emperors used to marry with Rajput kings to expand their power, similarly Congress and Akali are different parties in Punjab
 , But their big leaders are in-law, daughter-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law among themselves
 ashutosh ne punjab uniwarsity kii chaatra gunarit cor ke eme main likhe parche kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki prakaash singh badal ke cabinet mantri aadesh pratap singh unke damaad hai
 Adesh is the son of Pratap Singh Kairon, a Congress chief minister in Punjab for ten years
 captain amarinder singh kii patni simranjit singh maan kii patni or beant singh ke baad congress ke mukhyamantri haracharan singh baraar kii bahu aapas main bahanen hai
 Similarly, the Majithia family was considered a Congressman, but Surjit Singh Majithia's son Vikram Singh Majithia is now in Akali
 unki bahan kii shaadi dipti siem sukhbir singh badal se hui he
 Vikram himself is also an MLA and cabinet minister from Akali
 in shaadiyon ke zariye bhi badal sahab ne malwa or maajha ilaake main apni pakad majboot kii he

 patric french ke anusaar partiyon main vanshavaad kuch is prakaar he- NCP - 77
 8 pratisat 9 main se 7 BJD - 42
 9 pratishat 14 main se 6 Congress - 37
 5 pratishat 208 main se 78 SP - 27
 3 pratishat 22 main se 6 BJP - 22 out of 19 percent 116 yah ajeeb nahin he ki koi vanshavaad par hamalaa karte hue khud apane parivaar kaa zikr karata he
 One with tea, milk or poor family
 koi iskaa zikr kaise na karen
 Rahul Gandhi is besieged over dynasty and is asked to calculate his father's statement
 kya yah ajeeb nahin he
 The father accounted for the son
 lekin kya yah ajeeb nahin he ki vahi betaa modi se darane ke sawaal par kahata he ki maine apane parivaar main pita kii maut dekhi he, daadi kii maut dekhi he, main kisi ne nahin darataa
 Dynasty is the issue or spice
 kya sachmuch hamaare dal iske khilaaf gambhirtha se awaz uthaa rahe hai

The CCTV cameras installed in the temple not only saw the whole scene, but also captured them
 camera number ek (vaqt subah ke 5 bajkar 40 minute)is vaqt mandir parisar main ek safaikarmi apane kaam main laga tha
 Normally, devotees start visiting this historic place from the morning and cleanliness is a matter of daily
 lekin tabhi is safaikarmi ke peeche bani diwaar ke us paar jo kuch hota he, wo sirf is shaks ko hi nahin, balki aas-paas ke tamaam logon ko dahala detaa he
 a gust of dust and smoke arises from across the wall with a loud bang
 or puure mandir main afratfari much jaati he
 This explosion is so loud that the sweeper stands away from his place and tries to understand what is this thing? But despite this, he does not have the courage to go beyond the wall and runs away and saves his life
 ye gaya ke mahabodhi mandir main ravivaar ko hue das dhamaakon main se chatha dhamaakaa he, jo mukhya mandir or get ke bich hua or sisitivi camere main qaid ho gaya
 Camera number two (5 in the morning) 40 minute)mandir main ikke-dukke bhakton kaa aana shuru ho gaya
 The movement of people was going on from the temple gate
 or tabhi pichley dhamaake kii tarah hi ek baar phir diwaar ke us paar hue ek doosraa blast sabhi ko tharra diya
 This time here, apart from dust and smoke, pieces of bombs and parts of nearby trees were also scattered in the air
 is hamale main mandir main puja karne pahunche ek ladkaa or ladki bal-bal batch gaye
 The blast between the main temple and the gate was the seventh of the ten blasts at the Mahabodhi temple on Sunday morning
 or tab rah-rah kar ho rahe serial blast ne logon ko buree tarah daraa diya
 Camera number three (5 in the morning) 42 minute)is camere main thik do minute baad dhamaake main zakhmi hue ek buddha bhikshu kii tasviir qaid he
 Wounded in the attack, this monk tries to take a devotee to the Mahfooz hideout and all the people of the temple are looking for some place where they can save their lives
 isi dauraan zakhmi bhikshu kaa haal poochne duusare bhikshu bhi aage aate hai
 Camera number four (5 in the morning) 42 minute)lagaataar ho rahe dhamaakon ne mandir main aae tamaam logon ko dehshat main laa diya
 This camera captures pictures of the stampede of the temple
 kuch log sidhiyon kii taraf se jahaan baahar jane kii koshish kar rahe hai, vahiin duusari tasviir main tamaam log besakhta bhaag rahe hai
 Somebody is trying to get the child out of here in the lap, then some are trying to get their people out of here
 kahaan he aatankwaadi kii tasviir?camaron main darj tarikh apane vakt se 24 ghante peeche zarur chal rahi he, lekin prashasan kii maane to mandir main 15 sisitivi camaron main se 14 dhamaake ke dauraan kaam kar rahe the
 Now the question is which of these cameras captured the pictures of terrorists before the blasts and which is not, no one currently knows
 lekin chand camaron main dhamaake ke ye tasviren is baat kii gavaah hai ki kahin kisi camere main aatankwaadiyon kaa cheharaa bhi zarur aayaa hoga
 God was confident security
 a mysterious man was wandering around the temple, laying a net of bombs and the security personnel of the temple were sleeping in peace
 ek chashmadid ne bataaya ki usne sandigdh aatankwaadi ko mandir main ghoomte hue dekha
 He told that he was wandering around the entire temple like a terrorist butterfly and there was no security guard here
 darasal, duusare dinon kii tarah is rose bhi yah chashmadid (raagavataar prasad, badla hua naam) mandir main sir jhukaane subah paune paanch baje hi yahaan pahunch gaye the
 While they were walking around the temple, a 20-25 year old young man was moving around in the temple with two bags in great panic
 ek kaale rang kaa bag uske kandhe par tha, jabaki ek uske haath main
 And since it was such a strange thing to be in such a hurry with two-two bags of any devotee in the temple on this morning, Ramavatar was knocking his action
 raagavataar ne bataaya ki vah ek saanwale rang kaa aadmi tha
 Ram Avatar then decided to tell the security personnel about this person, but sadly, he could not find any such security personnel in the entire temple, so that he could complain about this mysterious person
 haar kar unhone mandir main jhaadu laga rahe ek safaikarmi ko uske bare main bataaya or parikrama karne ke iraade se aage chale gaye
 But what happened after a few minutes, he did not even think about it in his dream
 mandir main serial dhamaakon kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 Eyewitness Ram Avatar Prasad told that when he came out, the first one was blasted
 jaanaleva sarkari kahiliek antarrashtriya ahmiyat vaale aitihaasik dharohar main suraksha intazaamon kii ye haalat tab thi, jab is mandir main dhamaake kii ashanka ke bare main ibi or dilli police samet suraksha agenciyon ne bihar sarkaar ko maheenon pehle aagaah kar diya tha
 The condition on the occasion was that despite all this, the responsibility of security in the temple was handed over to the personal security personnel and in such a situation there was no guarantee of protection of the devotees coming from all over the world
 akhir suraksha ko lekar is lachar ravaiye kii vajah kya thi? yahi sawaal jab gaya ke dm murugan se poocha gaya, to unhone do took kaha, 'jo hona tha wo hua
 'when the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar is trying to put the ball of responsibility on such a serious issue in the court of bureaucrats, then this attitude of bureaucrats is not very surprising
 nitish kumaar se jab is bare main poocha gaya tha to unhone kaha ki diji bataaenge
 When will the action take place? However, when the time will be fixed for this powerful Kahili in defense, it will be known when the time comes, but at the moment, it can be said that in view of the whole situation, if the security arrangements in the temple are chalked- Had they been strong, perhaps these blasts could have been avoided
 buddha kii nagari main kisne kiya dhamaakaa?phir se serial blast or phir se vahi iem yani indian mujahidin
 All the security agencies of the country make lakhs of claims to break the IM module, with every blast the name of IM is attached
 ab bodhgaya main hue serial blast main bhi shaq isi iem kii taraf he
 After all, what is there in these blasts, which the police suspect is on the IM side? Investigations are on in this regard and the country's largest investigative agency is looking for clues
 dhamaakon ke peeche chupe chehre ko talashne ke liye jaanch agency anwar hossain naam ke ek shaks se poochtacha karne vaali he
 Anwar was arrested from Kolkata
 aarope he ki wo aatanki sanghathan indian mujahiddeen kaa sadsy he or riyaj bhatkal kaa behad kareebi mana jaataa he
 It is also alleged that Anwar supplied RDX for the Pune blasts
 anwar se poochtacha kii buniyaad main chupa he indian mujahiddeen par shaq
 It is reported that security agencies are convinced that the Indian Mujahideen is behind the Bodh Gaya blasts
 ravivaar ko kul 13 bam lagaae gaye the, jinamein 10 phute or teen jinda mil gaye
 It has been reported that the search agencies have found some important clues in the blast by the search of the live bomb and the temple
 abtak kii jaanch main agenciyon ke ek silendar mila he jisapar bade aksharon main buddha likhaa he
 Apart from this, there is also news of an ANIA letter written in Urdu
 shuruaati forencik jaanch ne ardex ke istemaal ko khaarij kar diya he
 About 150 grams of ammonium nitrate, sulfur, potassium and spikes were used in each bomb
 iske alaava dhamaake kii jagah se timer ke taur par istemaal hui ghadi bhi mili he
 An ID card of a man named Vinod Mistry has also been recovered from the blast site, which is being questioned
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vinod mistre history shiter rahaa he
 Investigation agencies are trying to reach the culprits of the blasts only after the clues from the temple and the questioning of the suspects
 dhamaakon ko naa roak paane kii jaanaleva kahili ke baad ek baar phir se tafteesh kii rasm adaayagi shuru ho gai he
 On the one hand the investigative agencies are taking away the bombs from the spot, on the other hand, the face-saving exercise is going on politically, but no one knows when the result will be
 nitish kumaar kah chuke hai ki dhamaakon ko puri tarah roka nahin ja saktaa

 hamane bihar chunaav main bhugta tha, so is baar ham donon (bijepi-sangh) satark the or mahaj do ghante main samooche vivaad par spashtikaran ho gaya
 Taking a relaxed breath, this remark of a senior BJP leader was also making a saying that the burning buttermilk of milk is also being drunk
 jaipur litarechar festival (jeelef) main 20 janvari kii shaam jab sangh ke varisht netaa manmohan vaidya ne kathith taur par aarakshan khatm karne kii pairvi kar di, to upi chunaav main jute bijepi ke ranneetikaron kii jaise saansen hi tham gayi
 Reason: During the Bihar election, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat's statement of reservation was overshadowed by the party, now it was raised by Manmohan Vaidya's statement
 bijepi kii yah sabase badi vidambnaa he ki aarakshan ke mohpash main vah baar-baar fansati rahi he or sanyog se yah fans bijepi ke matrusanghathan se hi aati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi woke up badly
 is par sarkaar or bijepi ke sheersh ranneetikaron kii sakriyata badi, jaipur ke phone ghanaghna uthe
 Rajasthan BJP President Ashok Parnami got the first call from Delhi, who was present at the JLF with Sangh's co-government chief Dattatreya Hosabale, All India Promotions Head Manmohan Vaidya and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 iske baad sihara dene vaali dilli kii thandi shaam or gulabi thand ke agosh main samaai gulabi nagari main pasinaa chhudaa dene vaali damege control kii kavayad der raat tak chali
 In fact, in JLF, questions were asked about Muslim reservation linking to caste system, reservation and Sachar Report
 iske jawaab main vaidya ne muslim aarakshan ko samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf or algaavvaad badhaane vaala bataaya
 But the controversy stemmed from his statement in which he made reference to the SC-ST reservation by Dr
 bi
 R
 ambedkar ko uddhrut karte hue kaha ki hameshaa ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan rahanaa uchit nahin he or jald se jald isaki aavashyaktaa nirast hokar samaan avasar dene kaa samay laana chahie
 Hosabale described the varna system as irrelevant and called caste reservation as per the constitution
 hosbale india today se kehete hai, ''donon baaten ek hi manch se teen minute ke antaraal par hi hui thim, jisamen jatigat aarakshan ko sangh ke samarthan kii baat kahi gai
 But after about an hour, it was found that confusion has been spread by changing the entire context on the reservation
 chunaav kaa vaataavaran he isliye swaabhaavik rup se use chunaav se jod diya gaya, isliye maine vahiin tay kiya ki ise spasht kar denge or media ko bulaakar manch par kahi gai baat spashtataa ke saath doharaai
 After Hosabale, Vaidya also gave his explanation in this matter
 lekin bijepi kii dhadakanen isliye bhi bad chuki thim kyonki bihar chunaav ke dauraan sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ke bayaan se party ko behad nuksaan hua tha
 So according to the sources, after the discussion of bjp-sangh leaders, it was decided that the cleanliness given to the TV channel would not stop the news printed in print, so hosabale-vaidya returned from Jaipur railway station at around 9
30 pm Reiterated the Union's stand supporting SC-ST-OBC reservation by holding a formal press conference on
 idhar, dilli main party or sarkaar ke varisht mantri der raat 2 baje tak yah sunishchit karne main lage rahe ki media main chhapane vaali khabar main sangh ke palatney vaali khabar ko praathamikta mili
 Spokespersons were instructed from the office of BJP President Amit Shah himself to vigorously debate the Sangh's statement regarding Muslim reservation and the denial of caste reservation
 is masale par vaidya kehete hai, ''bevajaah vivaad khadaa karne waalon se hi sawaal poochna chahie
 i will not comment on it yet
 ''bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai ki virodhiyon ko itihaas main jhaankna chahie kyonki aarakshan main majahab kaa ullekh pehali baar 1916 main hua tha jab pruthak nirvachan mandal kii baat hui thi jisane bharat-paak bantwaare ke beej boe the or vaidya kaa mantavya yahi tha
 He says that the Sangh is the only institution working on tribals and Dalits all over India, so it would not be rational to say that the intention of the Sangh is to abolish reservation
 lekin in daleelon se itar maujuun sawaal he jo bijepi main laalkrishna adwani ke jamaane se bahes kaa centre rahaa he
 Since then, there has been a discussion that the Sangh's views on purely political subjects are not favorable for the BJP
 ab bijepi satta main he or rajnatik kshetra main sangh ke kisi bhi aise bayaan kaa gahan chhidranveshan hona lajimi he
 The reaction of any idea of the Sangh is also natural, in this case the Sangh will have to show maturity along with the BJP
 lekin ab sangh ko tay karnaa hoga ki vah apane rajnatik chehre bijepi kii majaburi ko dekhte hue santulit hoga yaa mishanri disha lenaa chahega

 Film Name: Hey Broadirector: Ajay Chandocstar Cast: Ganesh Acharya, Prem Chopra, Maninder Singh, Hanif Hilal, Nupur Sharma, Indira Krishnan Duration: 113 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 1 Star Producer Director Choreographer and Actor Ganesh Acharya for the first time fully acting
 Have jumped into the ground for why? His film will definitely answer this
 diarector ke taur par ajay chandok kii ye chhathvi film he, pehali paanch filmon ne darshakon ko niraash hi kiya he, ab kya 'he bro' wo film he jo ajay chandok ke graph ko upar uthaati he, aaiye pataa karte hai-kahani:'he bro' kahani he gopi (ganesh acharya) kii jo rajasthan ke gaanv main apane dada (prem chopra) ke saath rahata he or uske dadaji gopi ko bade hone par bataate hai ki gopi kaa ek or judwa bhai he jo uske maa baap ke bich talaak ke baad maa ke saath bachapan main hi mumbai chalaa gaya tha
 Now Gopi had not even seen his brother's face, but due to being a twin, he goes to Mumbai to search for his mother and brother
 gopi ke paas apane bhai kii koi tasviir nahin hoti he to apni hi tasviir lekar sabhi se poochta rahata he kyonki use lagata he ki judawaan log to ek jaise hi dikhte hai
 He comes to Mumbai to meet Inspector Shiva (maninder Singh), but Gopi does not know that Shiva is his twin brother
 phir shiv kii jhadap hoti he mafia baba (hanif hilaal) se
 Now this story revolves around Mafia Baba, Shiva and Gopi, and does Gopi find her brother and mother? This is the story of 'hey Bro'
 kyon dekhen:film main sirf or sirf ek hi geet 'birju' he jo dekhne laayak he jahaan amitabh bachchan, ranvir singh, rithik raushan, akshay kumaar, ajay devgan, prabhu deva ek saath ek hi gane main aapako naachte hue najar aate hai
 So if you want to watch a song then you can watch the film, otherwise save money
 kyon naa dekhen:judwa bhaaiyon ke upar na jane kitni filmein banaai gai hai, lekin 'he bro' is vishay par bani sabase kamjor film lagati he
 It is a comedy to say, but there is hardly any place where you will laugh

 After the UP assembly elections, not only Akhilesh and Mayawati are ready to come together but the grand alliance exercise for 2019 is also gaining momentum
 yahi kaaran he ki agast main hone vaale lalu kii mahareli ke liye tamaam dalon ke netaa raji dikh rahe hai
 According to sources, Akhilesh and Mayawati are going to come together in Lalu's Maharaeli
 upi kii haar jhelane ke baad ab samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party jaisi chir pratidwandvi partiyon ko apane bhavishya ko lekar chintaa sataane lagi he
 This is the reason that the two parties which had become known enemies of each other in the elections, are now standing ready for mutual alliance
 akhilesh or maaya ke haal main aae bayanon ne ek tarah ke bihar kaa mahagathbandhan formula puure desh main lagu karne kii bhavishyavaanee kar di he lekin kya ye itnaa aasaan hoga? jawaab he nahin
 These are 5 big roadblocks to the path of Grand Alliance
 mahagathbandhan kaa netaa koun?upi chunaav main bijepi kii banpar jeet ke turant baad mahagathbandhan banane ko lekar congress or jediu ke bayaan aae the
 But at the same time the rhetoric started on who would be the leader
 congress ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke alaava or koi netaa nahin ho saktaa to jediu ne kaha ki modi ko sirf nitish hi takkar de sakate hai
 Later, Nitish also said that if congress-bsp and SP had fought together in UP, they would have got 10 percent more votes than BJP
 bihar main bijepi isliye haari kyonki yahaan vipaksh ekajute tha
 Now this solidarity has to be shown throughout the country
 tabhi bedaa paar hoga
 But the question here is what will be the opinion against Modi on a leader
 rahul gandhi, nitish, mulaayam, mamata, lalu, mayawati, naveen patnayak main piem phase ko lekar kis had tak sahmati ban paaegi isapar sabaki nigahen rahengi
 2
 kshatrapon kaa simit janadharamahagathbandhan ko lekar bayaan dena to thik lekin tamaam vipakshi dalon main aisa koi netaa nahin dikhataa jiskaa ek se zyada rajyon main asar ho
 Mulayam Singh or Akhilesh can have influence only in UP
 mayawati upise hi saaf hai baaki rajyon main asar par andeh hi he
 Lalu's party has come back to power somehow due to Nitish wave
 nitish kumaar kii party kaa bihar ke baahar prabhaav nahin dikhataa
 JDU is also second in Bihar Assembly
 piem pad kii nitish kii mahatvakanksha ko sahyogi argedy se kitna samarthan milegaa isapar bhi andeh he
 Mamta Banerjee has good influence in Bengal but how much regional parties of other states will accept her leadership
 congress kaa prabhaav puure desh main mana ja saktaa he lekin 2014 se abtak congress kaa graph girtaa hi gaya he or ise lekar rahul gandhi kii netritv kshamta ko lekar party ke andar hi sawaal uth rahe hai
 3
 rajyon main aapas main bhidin partiyon kaa kya hoga?modi virodh to thik lekin vipakshi dalon ke aapasi samikarnon kaa kya hoga? upi main astitv bachaane ke liye mahagathbandhan maaya or akhilesh kii majaburi ho sakati he lekin bengal main congress-trinmul congress-left kis had tak saath aaenge
 Will DMK-AIADMK come together in South? Will the sp-bsp-congress-rld come together in Bihar? jaise tamaam sawaal hai jo modi lahar ke khilaaf vipakshi ekajutata par sawaal khadey karte hai
 4
 modi virodh ke alaava factor kya honge?mahagathbandhan kaa concept to thik he lekin kya ye mahagathjod sirf modi factor ke khilaaf janata ke bich jayega
 At a time when the BJP is winning in every election under the name Modi, in such a situation, how much will the aggressive morality of Khilafat Khilafat be able to get will be a big question
 is factor par khud congress ko hi andeh he
 After the UP elections, the internal report of the Congress clearly stated that the party has suffered in the recent elections due to the image of the party against Hindutva and being merely anti-modi
 khud rahul gandhi party kii ranneeti ko nae sire se aage badhaane kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahe hai
 Even the news about the Aam Aadmi Party is that it has started rethinking its strategy of opposing Modi
 5
 How will the alliance be decided at the grassroots level? If these two dozen parties are united in the name of the grand alliance, then how much their workers will come together, this factor will also be important
 upi main sapa-congress ne milakar chunaav to ladaa lekin kai siton par donon dalon ke ummidavaar maidan main utar gaye

 Officers of the anti-corruption Cell of CBI kept searching till late night in IMA office on ITO in Delhi too
 ye chaape bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch ko lekar maare gaye hai
 Dr
 Ketan Desai is accused of taking government money from several private medical colleges
 sibiai ke pravaktaa harsh bahal ne bataaya ki desai ko yahaan unke karyaalay par maare gaye chhaapon ke baad gat der raat giraftaar kiya gaya
 The action was carried out after receiving a complaint that he along with his colleague Jitendra Pal Singh is demanding a bribe of Rs 2 crore for giving recognition to a college in Punjab
 bahal ne bataaya ki sibiai ne desai singh or unke ek anya sahyogi punjab ke gyaan sagar medical college ke dow

 pravaktaa ne bataaya ki teenon se poochtacha kii ja rahi he or dilli tathaa baahar sthit chah anya thikaanon par chhapemari jari he
 The CBI, after receiving the complaint, laid a trap and nabbed Singh with the alleged two crore rupees which were to be given to Desai
 agency ne desai ke anya sahyogiyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye punjab dilli or gujarat main bhi chaape maare
 Setting the same standard of medical education is the main task of the Medical Council of India, etc
, to give recognition to the medical institutions of India or abroad or to recommend their cancellation

 taapasi pannu or amitabh bachchan kii 'pink' dekhi to bahut kuch dimag main gum gaya
 After all, like this story, i was also entered in Delhi with a bag in my hand, a dream in my eyes, and a lot of guidance in my mind
 pichley ek dashak main ladakon ke saath khub dosti bhi hui or parties bhi kii
 Affair should also be there and broken
 or inaki charchaa bhi khub hui
 Girls bonding was also very enjoyable
 kabhi tension share kii to kabhi wine-vodka kii bottle
 In this way, every step of mine was in a circle even while walking with the times
 kabhi kisi se budtamiji nahin, parking kaa jhagada nahin
 There is no talking in a loud voice
 makaan maalik bhi khush kyonki ghar saaf rahata tha or kiraaya time par aata tha
 'big B' narrated film dialogues on the stage of # mindrocks16
 
 
 lekin kahin na kahin lagata rahaa ki meraa har kadam apane daayre main hone ke baavjood log mujhe or piji kii meri frends ko ajeeb najaron se dekhte the
 i was very close to Karan then
 conot place kii us hai class coffee shop main ham ekbar der raat baithe the
 When he said a lot, he felt that he had seen a lot of Delhi night in the office cab, why not go out with 'trusted friend' today
 main gai bahut utsaah ke saath lekin lauti utani hi hataasha or niraashaa ke saath
 Then i could not tell you anything
 meri problem par jab tumhaari soch mere saamne ai to hairaan thi
 Then your 'some fun' offer
 kuch samaj nahin pai
 Just blocked your number from there
 lekin pareshaani tumhen block kar dene se khatm nahin hui
 i used to catch a glimpse of you from time to time in every friend
 meri hansi, mere kapade, mere tatu, piersing kaa meraa shauk, meraa wine kaa gilaas, mere offis ke timming, let nite movie dekhne kaa meraa shauk, apane room par mail frends ko aane kii ijaajat dena jaisi baton par aane vaale riection mere andar ke khiz bhar rahe the
 Could not understand what to answer
 kis-kis kaa munh band karun or kisko ek khinch kar tamaacha jad duun
 The extent was reached when my cousin once raised questions on my night shift
 or mere jawaab dene par yahi samajhaayaa ki itnaa atitude thik nahin hota
 From his talk, i felt that uncle had done wrong by sending him to Foreign University
 agar use yahi sochna tha to wo yahaan kisi vokational college main hi pard letaa
 At least several lakh rupees of the house would have been saved
 or phir wo 'pink'lekin'pink'dekhakar laga ki apni ek maheene kii kamai in sabhi ko yah film dikhaane main kharch kar duun
 Every scene i felt connected to my life
 lag rahaa tha ki shaayad 'pink' ke is sho se main apane aasapaas kaa maahaul badal sakuungi
 Karan, i can tell you that in PG it is not just to be free
 ye aapako jimmedaar banaata he, apane liye
 Girls living in such places are not 'easily available'
 iske liye sahi shabd he Independent
 And yes, when you came for lunch that day, what did you say about drying out the undergarments? Be ashamed
 
 
 lekin tumhaare ghar jane par vahaan bhi kapade baahar hi sookhte dikhe the
 i did not relate it to your tameez, culture and character
 jab 'pink' dikhaaungi to apane kajan se bhi puch luungi ki tere offis main der tak kaam karne kaa matlab he bahut mehnat karnaa
 So how can my hard work be 'gulcharre'
 tum apane offis kii ladakiyon ke ghar jaldi jane par aitraaj karte ho lekin ham tumhen 7 baje hi ghar main band kyon dikhen
 i have also heard that knowledge of Valentine's Day
 
 
 ek baar nahin kai baar ki ladki he to ek baar to manaa karegi hi
 But listen
 
 
 meri naa kaa matlab naa hi he
 There was no hiding in it
 
 Then why should it not happen in any case
 us new year kii party main meri vah saheli zyada pikar ladkadai or sanbhalane ke liye usne tumhaara kandhaa pakad liya tha
 And what i saw in your eyes, i felt bad
 yah kuch aisa tha jaise tumhaare dost mujhe dekhte the, party main tumhaare saath jane or drink lene par
 My laugh too seemed like an invitation to him
 chaunkaane vaale hai mahilaon ke saath hone vaale aparaadh ke ye aankade
 
 
 After getting the neck tattooed, a question was asked about why there is so much rebellion and at the same time he started showing more and more interest
 achaanak se ghar se pick and drop ke ofer dene laga
 When i spoke for the sake of formality only, he told me something else in the entire office

 Union Sports Minister Jeetendra Singh is not happy with the ongoing preparations for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Asian Games in South Korea
 singh ko is baat kii naaraazgi he ki mahaj kuch khel mahasanghon ne in khelon kii taiyaariyon ke liye vistrut prashikshan kaarykram kaa byora diya he
 The ministry had also asked federations to make a list of potential medal winners, but no work has been done in this direction as well
 khel mantralay ne mangalvaar ko jari apane bayaan main kaha ki singh ne khel mahasanghon se kaha tha ki ve har ek khel ke liye alag se mukhya coach or sahyogi staff kii niyukti karen or yah sunishchit karen ki ye log apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvahan karen
 Singh also instructed the Sports Federations to hold a meeting every week with the steering committee headed by the Sports Secretary and discuss the training program for each sport
 rashtramandal khelon se pehle tak yah prakriya chalati rahani chahie
 It was also decided to identify high level training for the players and then provide necessary funds from the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF)
 iske liye bhartiya khel praadhikaran (sai) ke nideshak ko kharche kaa byora pesh karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 With this help, suitable help will be provided to the players
 singh ko is baat kii ashanka he ki agle rashtramandal khelon main bharat ko kam se kam 30 padakon kaa nuksaan hoga kyonki isamen teerandaji, greeko roman kushti, shooting (team spardhaa) sahit kai spardhaaen shaamil nahi hai
 In the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India won 30 per cent of its total medals in the appropriate events
 tippaniyan Compared to the Commonwealth Games, the number of competitions for the Asian Games is much lower
 agle asian khelon main shatranj, billiards or snooker jaisi spardhaaen nahin hongi
 The minister said that he wanted to know how these events were finally dropped from the sporting event two years ago without knowing India's opinion
 khel mantri ne sachiv (khel) se kaha he ki vah is maamle ko rashtramandal khel sachivalay tak pahunchaaen
 Singh is displeased that only a few sports federations have given detailed training programs for the preparation of these sports
 mantralay ne mahasanghon se sambhavit padak vijetaon kii suchi bhi banane kaa kaha tha, lekin is disha main bhi koi kaam nahin ho sakaa he
 The Sports Ministry, in its statement issued on Tuesday, said that Singh had asked the Sports Federations to appoint a separate head coach and support staff for each sport and ensure that these people discharge their responsibilities
 singh ne khel mahasanghon ko yah bhi nirdesh diya tha ki ve khel sachiv kii adhyakshata vaali stearing kamity ke saath har hafte ek baithak karen or har ek khel ke prashikshan kaarykram kii charchaa karen
 This process must continue until the Commonwealth Games
 yah bhi faisla kiya gaya tha ki khilaadiyon ke liye ucchstareey prashikshan kii pahchaan kii jaae or phir rashtriya khel vikaas nidhi (enesdief) se uske liye jaruri dhan muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 For this, the Director of Sports Authority of India (SAI) has been asked to submit the details of the expenditure
 isaki madad se khilaadiyon ko upyukt madad muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 Singh fears that India will lose at least 30 medals in the next Commonwealth Games as it does not include many events including archery, greco-roman wrestling, shooting (team events)
 nai dilli main 2010 main hue rashtramandal khelon main bharat ne upyukt spardhaon main apane kul padakon kaa 30 fisadi hissaa hasil kiya tha
 The comments rashtramandal khelon kii tulana main asian khelon ke liye baahar kii gai spardhaon kii sankhya kaaphi kam he
 The next Asian Games will not feature competitions such as chess, billiards and snooker
 mantri ne kaha ki vah yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki bharat kii raay jane bina aakhirkaar in spardhaon ko do saal pehle is khel aayojan se kaise baahar kar diya gaya
 The Sports Minister has asked the Secretary (sports) to refer the matter to the Commonwealth Games Secretariat
 khel mantralay ne mangalvaar ko jari apane bayaan main kaha ki singh ne khel mahasanghon se kaha tha ki ve har ek khel ke liye alag se mukhya coach or sahyogi staff kii niyukti karen or yah sunishchit karen ki ye log apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvahan karen

 desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai ne aarushi cese ko kaise maaraa ise samajhane ke liye kuch sawaalon ko samajhnaa jaruri he

 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar did not provide any evidence against him? Question No
 10 Talwar couple are accused or victims? Also in the case The weakest link was that the CBI could not prove till the end that on the night of May 15-16, there were only four people surfing at the house of Dr

 ) In the Punjab National Bank scam case, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs has offered an explanation on the statement of the Antigua Authority
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki mehul chokasee par ghotaale ke aarope tay hone se pehle antigua or barbuda kii ikai 'da citijanship bai investment' (siaiu) ko kisi prakaar kii pratikul janaakaari nahin di gai thi
 Because until that time in 2017, there were no allegations against Choksi
 darasal, mehul chokasee ko naagarikta dene kii baat par antigua or barbuda kii ikai 'da citijanship bai investment' ne safai pesh kii thi or kaha tha ki naagarikta dene se pehle unhone 2017 main bhartiya agenciyon or passport offis se chokasee ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 In response to which Indian agencies had not lodged any objection to Choksi
 saath hi bharat ne antigua ko yah spasht kiya tha ki chokasee ke khilaaf kisi prakaar ke ghotaale kaa yaa phir dhokhadhadi kaa aarope nahin he
 After this, Antigua granted Choksi citizenship of his country
 siaiu ke mutabik '2017 main mehul chokasee kii taraf se antigua or barbuda kii CIU ikai ke nivesh adhinium 2013 kii dhara 5 (2) (bi) tahat sabhi jaruri dastavejon ke saath aavedan kiya gaya tha
 CIU said, 'after Choksi's application, CIU asked for information from India
 jiske jawaab main bharat sarkaar ke videsh maamalon ke kshetreey passport karyaalay ne yah spasht kiya tha ki mehul chokasee ke khilaaf koi pratikul jaankaree nahin he, jisase unke antigua or barbuda ke liye vija samet anya yatra suvidhaon ko praapt karne main baadha bane
 Choksi was granted Antigua citizenship in 2017
 CIU ne kaha ki chokasee ko naagarikta pradaan karne se pehle unki kai str par jaanch kii gai thi
 It also collected information from open source Internet checks, Thompson Reuters world-czech, regional and international intelligence agencies such as Interpol
 sabhi se mili jaankaree kaa mulyankan kiya gaya, jiske baad chokasee ke aavedan par nirnay liya gaya
 According to Antigua officials, SEBI had also received a favorable response regarding Choksi
 CIU ne kaha, 'sebi ne siaiu ko 2014 or 2017 ke do maamalon ke dastavej saunpe jo chokasee se sambandhit the
 Out of which one case was satisfactorily closed and the other case was barred from proceeding in the absence of evidence
 saath hi vartmaan ke pienbi ghotaale kaa bhi donon maamalon se koi sambandh nahin he
 It was also found that non-bailable warrants were also scrapped in 2016
 ' haalanki sebi kaa kahana he ki unhone antigua ko kisi prakaar ke dastavej nahin saunpe hai
 However, last week, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had said that Interpol had never approached them in the last 4 years regarding Mehul Choksi
 jabaki siaiu ne kaha, 'naagarikta dene se pehle jaanch ke dauraan interpol se bhi jaankaree maangi thi, jisamen interpol ne chokasee par kisi bhi prakaar ke aarope se inkaar kar diya tha
 Interpol should have known if a warrant had been issued against Choksi
 aisa hota to interpol se hamen bhi jaankaree mil jaati
 Apart from this, the Indian criminal database record should also have the information of the warrant
 saath hi videsh mantralay dwaara die gaye clearence bhi ise shaamil karnaa chahie tha
 'had this been done, Choksi's citizenship would not have been approved
