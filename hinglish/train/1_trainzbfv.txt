 The ACB is legally headed by the director Vigilance, but because the senior police officer who appears, in practice, we consider him to be the head, so Yadav and Meena are considered to be the heads, but because now the portfolios of both have been divided, so both There are no heads for the government

 This suspension will come into force in Srinagar and Hurriyat chapters with immediate effect
 ajtak ke oparation hurriyat kaa zikr karte hue gilaani ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir ke log hamaare andolan ko apane dharm kii tarah maanate aae hai
 Some people are trying to discredit our movement
 gilaani ne kaha, 'hamanenim ahamed khansahit sabhi sanvaidhanik sadasyon ko bulaayaa, taaki ve akjicutive body ke samaksh apana mat rakh sake
 However the police administration did not allow him to hold a meeting at his residence in Hyderpora
 'saiyad ali shah gilaani ne kaha kinaim ahmadane apni press conference main sting vaale video clip par sawaal khadaa kiya he
 And as they have reposed faith in me, until the truth is revealed in this matter, the suspension will continue
 unhone kaha ki forum kaa head hone ke naate meri yah naitik jimmedaari he ki apane daayitv ko puraa karun
 What is National Front? Tell us that there are two factions of Hurriyat Conference
 inkaa netritv mir viz umr faruk or saiyad ali shah gilaani ke paas he
 The National Front is Naeem Khan's party, part of the All Party Hurriyat Conference of separatists
 pehle yah mir viz umr faruk vaale dhade ke saath the
 It was later partitioned in 2014 in Hurriyat
 mir viz umr faruk ke netritv vaale hurriyat ke khilaaf chaar netaaon ne baghawat kar di
 Naeem Khan was also among them
 9 sitambar 2015 ko shabbir shah or naeem khan, shiya leader aagaa hasan ke saath saiyad ali shah gilaani vaale hurriyat conference (G) main shaamil ho gaye
 Know what were the revelations in Aaj Tak's sting operation
 ajtak / india today kii vishesh jaanch team (SIT) ne apni tahakikat main patharbaajon ke dhoort financers ko benakaab kiya tha
 It has always been believed that the strands of disturbances spread during the summer in the Kashmir Valley are connected to sponsors sitting across the border
 lekin pehali baar india today ko is sambandh main pukhta saboot jutaney main kamyaabi mili

 camere par hurriyat ke kai netaaon ne kabool kiya ki unhen pakistan se fund miltaa he taaki ghati main ashaanti kaa maahaul banaae rakhaa ja sake

 Naeem then secretly reached Delhi to meet undercover reporters

 The revelations that Naeem made were shocking
 naeem khan camere par ye kehete hue kaid hua ki 'pakistan pichley 6 saal se kashmir main bada pradarshan khadaa karne ke liye haath-pair maar rahaa he
 '5
 ghati main hinsa ko badhaava dene ke liye kis str par paisa dhakela ja rahaa he, is par naeem khan ne kaha, 'pakistan se aane vaala paisa saikadon karod se zyada he, lekin ham or zyada kii ummid karte hai
 '6
 hurriyat netaa ne ye bhi kabuula ki kis tarah islamabad kaale dhan kii dhulaai ko bhi anjaam de rahaa he
 In this way, for the first time any Kashmiri separatist leader revealed this on camera

 The confession of Hurriyat leaders in the sting made it clear how Pakistan writes the script of anger shown in the valley

 BJP performed brilliantly in the assembly elections held in five states
 upi-uttarakhand main aitihaasik jeet hasil kii
 Except Punjab, the BJP secured good seats in other states
 goa main clear jeet nahin mili par manipur main apni maujuudagi se sabko chaunkaaya
 Apart from Modi, BJP leaders are giving credit to party president Amit Shah
 is jeet ke baad ab ye charchaa tej ho gai he ki shah kii agali planning kya hogi? agar planning par baat karen to shah ab un 120 loksabhaa siton par party kii takat majboot karenge jo philhal bijepi ke haath main nahin he
 Apart from this, elections are going to be held in 5 states including Gujarat in the next 6 months
 vahaan bhi ve party ko jeet dilaane kii planning main jute gaye hai
 Shah 1 will prepare in these states before 2019
 is saal yani 2017gujarat, nagaland, meghalaya or himachal main 2017 ke ant main chunaav honge
 There is a BJP government in Gujarat and is in alliance in Nagaland
 himachal va meghalaya main congress kii sarkaarhai
 The BJP will push for greater success in Gujarat
 uttar-purv kii safalataa use nagaland, meghalaya, tripura main jeet dilaa sakati he
 2
 agle saal yani 2018karnataka, rajasthan, chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh or mizoram main 2018 main chunaav honge
 BJP will be under pressure to form government for the fourth time in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and save the government in Rajasthan
 bade rajyon main mahaj karnataka congress ke paas he
 Here BJP was formed in 2008 and Congress in 2013
 is baar BJP kii sambhaavna he
 3
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yani 2019arunachal, sikkim, andhrapradesh, telugana or odisha main 2019 ke shuru main chunaav honge yaa loksabhaa ke saath bhi chunaav ho sakate hai
 There is a BJP government in Arunachal and a coalition government in Andhra Pradesh
 telugana main tiares, odisha main BJD kii sarkaar he
 BJP will have to try to make a dent here
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main hona he
 Before that there will be assembly elections in 15 states
 inamen gujarat, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, karnataka, andhrapradesh, telugana or odisha jaise bade rajya hai, to mizoram, tripura, himachal, meghalaya, nagaland jaise chote rajya bhi
 According to the information on the battle to capture these 120 Lok Sabha seats, Amit Shah now wants to bring BJP to where the party's presence is less
 iske liye unhone 120 loksabhaa siton ko tay kiya he
 These seats are mainly from the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and North East
 bataa den ki in rajyon main kul loksabhaa siton kaa aankada dekha jaae to 200 ke kareeb he
 In such a situation, Shah wants to win at least 120 seats here
 is taiyaari ke kya hai myne?bijepi ke paas philhal loksabhaa main 282 siten hai
 If Shah is focusing on winning 120 more seats, it clearly means that he is setting a target of 402 for the party
 sara credit amit shah ko kyon?indian express ke mutabik, jeet ke baad shanivaar ko narendra modi or amit shah ke bich phone par baatcheet hui
 Both congratulated each other on the victory
 home ministar rajnath singh ne shah ko sabase pehle badhai di
 He said- This is your victory, to which Shah replied- This is your victory
 dilli main kareeb 72 sau bacchon se har saal yon shoshan hota he
 Delhi ranks third in sexual offenses against children
 to aakhir kya hai tareeke taaki samaay main fail rahi is gandagi ko roka ja sake taaki maasoom bachapan bachaa rahe
 Delhi is once again ashamed
 paanch saal kii maasoom ke saath haivaaniyat kaa nanga naach hua
 Now this innocent is swinging between life and death
 ames main use bachaane kii koshishen jari hai
 But millions of innocent people living in this city have arisen
 khauf kii chadar or moti ho gai he
 Many layers of panic have frozen in their heartbreak as the nation's capital has failed to protect the innocent
 ek aankade ke mutabik saal 2010 ke mukaable saal 2011 main bacchon ke khilaaf aparaadh 24 fisadi bade hai
 This increased to 12 in Delhi
 8 fisadi ke hisaab se hui he
 That is, Delhi is third in crimes against children as compared to other states of the country
 dilli main kareeb har saal 7200 bachche yon shoshan kaa shikaar hote hai
 In such a situation, the question arises, where are these children most at risk? Experts believe that the biggest danger to the innocent is from the home, neighborhood and relatives
 iske alaava skool or bal ashramon main bhi kai baar bachche yonshoshan ke shikaar hote hai
 Because the government has not made adequate security arrangements for children here, the question is also how to eradicate this stigma in the society? Police, child labor and hospitals to protect children from crimes like sexual exploitation
 Employees residing in India have to be sensitized
 ghar or paas-pados main rahane vaale logon ke vyavhaar par dhyaan dena chahie
 Parents should give enough time to the children
 sandigdh vyavhaar vaale logon se bacchon ko dur rakhana chahie
 Children should be prevented from playing with strangers and going out of the house
 ab vakt aa gaya he jab bacchon kii parvarish par khaas dhyaan dene kaa
 To take strict measures against those who commit sexual offenses against the innocent

 The old pensioners, both tired losers, sat down inside the hot bed after grabbing two glasses of water
 kaise mare? kya hua tha? yah sab kaise ho gaya? kal tak to thik the, jaise prashnon ke baad ek chuppi
 Now how long someone talks about dead man
 taaja maut hui thi or shav abhi padaa tha isliye aawaaj oonchi nahin uth sakati thi
 The elder girl lived in Haridwar
 use taar de diya gaya tha
 The body was placed between the ice blocks
 itani tej garmi main chaar-paanch ghante bhukhe rahanaa to sambhav tha, parantu sookhte gale ko sahanaa kathin tha
 a tub was filled with water and ice
 gilaason ko dhone, unhen rakhane-uthaane kii aawaaj udhaas chuppi ko tod rahi thi
 Sometimes there were scattered voices like guilt-ridden in the desire for water
 auraton ke bich ghiri shav kii patni kii kaa vilaap ab hichkiyon main badal gaya tha
 People were burning in the sun waiting for the big girl
 pratiksharat logon ko marane vaale ke marane kaa dukh kam ho rahaa tha or ladki ke ab tak na aane kaa ksht bad rahaa tha
 The sadness was turning into restlessness
 bahut der tak jameen par ghutane mode kar na baith paane vaale dardiya rahe the
 The bards were feeling silent
 dhire-dhire logon ne parichiton ke paas simatakar fusfusaahat main batiyana shuru kar diya
 The corpse was wrapped in snow
 garmi ke kaaran pine kaa pani kam pad rahaa tha
 Did not expect to have to wait that much
 haridwar se taxi dilli ke border tak to thik ai par dilli main ghuste hi jam main funs gai thi
 Everyone's heart was stunned by the heat of heat
 dur dur tak koi nahin dikhaai de rahaa tha jaise chunaav haari hui party ke karyaalay main dur-dur tak koi najar nahin aata he
 The old man was getting bored
 vah bahut jaldi bor ho jaataa he
 Anyway, it was his favorite serial
 achaanak usne do bacchon ko daudte hue apni taraf aate hue dekha
 He turned his attention here
 donon main jaise pehle pahunchane kii hode-si lagi hui thi
 One will be twelve-fourteen years old and the other will be around seven-eight years old
 us bheeshan garmi main na jane kis ummid main ve is ore bhaagate hue aa rahe the
 The older boy arrived earlier
 usne jaise hi shav ko barf kii silli par pade dekha, sahamkar ruk gaya
 He had put his hands on his head
 chota bhi pahunch gaya or usne prashnvachak ankhon se bade kii ore dekha
 The older boy put the younger's hand on his head
 donon ke chehre bataa rahe the ki unhone kuch anhona dekha he
 He came running in hope
 shaayad shaamiyana laga dekhakar unhone sochaa hoga ki koi shaadi-byaah he
 Both were gasping because of their escape
 bade ne nekar or kameez pahani hui thi or chota nekar main tha
 Both were barefoot and placed their hands on the head, now staring at the crowd
 nange pair jalane lage to donon chhaanh main khadey ho gayi
 It was not necessary for them to stay there, but perhaps there was a panic or they had lost the courage to return due to running in such a sun
 aate samay to kuch mil jane kii ummid thi, parantu jate samay
 
 
 
 chote ladke ko shaayad pyaas lag aayi thi
 He was slowly moving towards the water, where the tub of water lay
 vahaan pahunchakar usne hatheliyon se ok banaakar pani maanga tha, parantu us adhanange vibhats bachche ko saamne dekhte hi vahaan khadey sajjan ne use daant diya tha
 When the little boy asked for water again in the helplessness of thirst, the gentleman grinned and ran to kill him
 barf kaa thanda pani baithe hue logon ke liye tha, na ki us aawaara ladke ke liye
 The little boy was standing near the big, helpless, disappointed, his lips were drying and he was repeatedly tongue-washing them
 is bich pratiksha khatm ho gayi thi
 The daughter had arrived
 shav ko nahalaane ke liye use barf kii silliyon main se nikaala gaya
 The ice blocks were rolled into a nearby dry drain
 chote ladke ne jeebh se ek baar phir hothon ko tar kiya tha
 The sound of 'ram Naam Satt' arose
 ‘ramanaam satt he, satt bolo gatt he
 "A soulless body was rising from the fraternity of the living
" tabhi maine us chote ladke ko dekha
 He was picking and sucking a piece of ice thrown into the drain
 uskaa doosraa haath uske sar par tha
 The elder scolded him - throw it, it's dead snow
 chote ne chuusate hue kaha - barf juthi thode hoti he

 Former captain Ian Chappell criticized Cricket Australia for agreeing to the upcoming ODI series against India, saying that matches held at the 'wrong time' would have a bad effect on the team's morale, as the spin-friendly pitches here His batting weaknesses will be revealed
 bharat or australia kii timen is siries main ek twanti-20 or 7 vanade match khelengi
 Chappell said that this entire series has been organized for money only
 chapel ne likhaa, ‘bharat ke is bematlab daure ke liye sahamat hona or wo bhi ashes siries ke kareeb, isse saaf pataa chalata he ki cricket australia ke liye samaj ke bajaay dollar kaa matlab kahin zyada he
 "he said," Australia's loss in the Test will not only harm the record book, but it will also reduce the morale of the team
 australia kii kamajori is dauraan ballebaaji hi rahi he or acchhee spin gendbaaji se jujhane se uski ballebaaji kamajoriyaan ujagar ho jaayengi
 Chappell said, "former players at the recent Lord's event in London had commented before the recent inquiries as to what happened to Australia's batting?" sachin tendulkar viral bukhaar ke kaaran pehle test cricket match ke chauthe din england kii pari ke dauraan tisare satr main hi kshetrarakshan ke liye aaye or is vajah se unhen bharat kii duusari pari main saatven number par ballebaaji ke liye utarana pad saktaa he
 According to the rules of this series, a player will not be allowed to bat as long as he does not spend that much time on the field while batting or his team's five wickets fall
 Only then will he be allowed to bat
 yadi tendulkar saatven number par ballebaaji ke liye aate hai to unka lords ke aitihaasik maidan par 100waan antarrashtriya shatak banane kaa sapana shaayad hi puraa ho paaegaa
 Given his age, this will probably be his last chance to score a century on Lords
 unke samakaleen mahaan ballebaaj riki ponting or bryan lara bhi is maidan par shatak nahin laga paae hai
 Tendulkar was dismissed for 34 in the first innings
 lords par unka sarvaadhik score 37 ran he

 The Foreign Secretaries of the two countries have been asked to decide the program and the framework for this
 isamen kai or chizon ko bhi joda ja saktaa he
 In general terms, the overall dialogue is meant to be included in the conversation on all important issues from Jammu and Kashmir, Siachen, terrorism, narcotics to Sir Creek
 isaki shuruyaat 1997 main kii gai thi
 Under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's rule it was named Composite Dialogue

 Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, "unless Pakistan ends terrorism in our country, there is no use of any kind of dialogue
" mumbai main kasaab ko hamane faansee de di, lekin duusare aaropee ko pakistan ne bel de di, jo khuleam gum rahaa he
 However, the Akali Dal, an ally of the BJP in Punjab, welcomed the conversation and hoped that it would improve relations between the two countries

 This is a historic opportunity for the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal to implement their election manifesto and they should not try to abdicate this responsibility
 aap ne vipaksh main baithne ke liye chunaav nahin ladaa tha or na hi use vot dene vaale matadaata apane liye vipaksh chun rahe the
 Therefore, if there is a fine opportunity, you should try to garner support, form a government and run it
 agar koi use baahar se samarthan detaa he, yaa vidhansabha main matdaan ke dauraan anupasthit rahakar sarkaar chalaane detaa he, to aap ko sarkaar chalaane kii jimmedaari uthaani chahie
 It will always have the way that if a party or MLA tries to do wrong things to it or twists its arm, then it will let the government fall, but will not compromise 'unethical'
 kisi bhi eemaandaar party ko aisa hi karnaa chahie
 By forming a government, you can provide electricity at half the rate, 700 liters of free water, regularize all illegal colonies, withdraw fake cases against Muslim youth, strictly enforce SC-ST and OBC reservation in government jobs and fill backlog vacancies, The eviction of the corrupt public servants, sending them to jail and confiscating property, permitting all the cleaning workers and drivers of Delhi , Will be able to move hundreds like Urdu and enhance the status of Punjabi language, which he has promised in its manifesto
 agar bijepi yaa congress in kaamon main rode atakati he, to ve aisa apni jaakhim par hi karengi
 There is no doubt that Delhi's mandate is unclear
 is janadesh main ekmaatr spashtataa yah he ki dilli kii janata ne congress ko riject kar diya he
 Rejecting the Congress, people tried two options
 inamen se bijepi ko 32 or aap ko 28 siten mili hai
 Obviously, it is not easy for the BJP to form a government in the 70-member assembly
 bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii ek hi surat he ki aap uskaa samarthan kare
 According to the current political arithmetic, its chances are less
 lekin kya yahi baat aap ke bare main kahi ja sakati he
 Probably not
 agar aap sarkaar banane kaa daawa karti he, to use bijepi kaa samarthan mil bhi saktaa he
 You should try it
 agar samarthan na bhi mili, to agar aap apane ghoshnaa-patr ko lagu karne ke daawa ke saath sarkaar banane kaa daawa karti he, to kya bijepi uskaa virodh karegi
 Election and more than that, history has put Arvind Kejriwal's party AAP at such a point from where every step taken by him will be very important
 kya kejariwal iske liye taiyaar hai? On the day IK officer DK Ravi of Karnataka allegedly committed suicide, he called one of his female colleagues of the 2009 IAS batch 44 times within an hour

 unke shav ko unki patni kusuma ne tab dekha, jab kol kaa jawaab nahin dene par dupliket chaabi se ghar kaa darwaja kholkar vah andar gayi
 The police have described Ravi's death as a prima facie suicide and the state government has entrusted the investigation of the case to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
 haalanki, ravi ke parijanon kaa kahana he ki unki maut ke peeche koi sajeesh he or maamle kii kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) se jaanch karai jaani chahie

 How much information does a lawyer have? uski bahes karne kii kshamta kisi he

 Only a judge can take a better decision on all these aspects

 chif justise banane ke baad justise dattu kaa kaarykaal ek saal se zyada kaa tak hoga

 america main ek khabar chal rahi he ki bhartiya mul kii america saansad tulsi gabord ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke huston main hone vaale houdi modi kaarykram main shaamil hone se manaa kar diya he
 The case caught fire when a member of Tulsi Gabbard's publicity team told the Organization of Minorities of India (OFMI)
 houdi modi kaarykram 22 sitambar ko hona he
 Tulsi Gabbard is also a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential election in the US
 lekin, yah khabar galat sabit hui he
 It has been reported from the US that Tulsi Gabbard has a program in Iowa on September 22, so she will not be able to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Howdy Modi program
 lekin, iske baad tulsi gabord khud pradhanmantri narendra modi se neuyork main milengi

 OFMI kii website par chal rahi khabar

 org main chape lekh ke anusaar, tulsi gabord ke is inkaar ko congressman ro khanna kii us apil se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he, jisamen khanna ke kaha tha ki hindu dharm ke ham sabhi america rajanetaaon ko bahuwaad kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 We must renounce Hinduism
 hamen hindu, muslim, sikh, buddha or isaiyon ke liye baraabar adhikaron kaa samarthan karnaa chahie

 yah naitikta par aadhaarit baat he
 According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the Bharatiya Janata Party has an ideology regarding Hindutva that all non-hindus are foreigners
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2013 main khud kaha tha ki meri pahchaan hindutvvaadi kii he
 In 1923, VD Savarkar, a supporter of religious nationalist political ideology, also said that India should be a country of Hindus only
 isamen sirf hindu hi rahane chahie
 In 2014, US MP Tulsi Gabbard was also seen in an event related to the election campaign of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 isamen unhone bhaajapa ke chunaav chinh vaala scorf pahana tha
 Apart from this, Tulsi Gabbard presented the Bhagavad Gita to Narendra Modi
 isi gita ko haath main rakhkar tulsi ne shapathgrahan kii thi
 In 2016, Tulsi Gabbard said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is such a political example from which leaders of the whole world should learn
 2018 se ab tak tulsi gabord kaa america main kaaphi virodh hua he
 This is because Tulsi Gabbard was associated with several American Hindutva groups
 isamen se pramukh hai - oversij frends of da bijepi or hindu swayamsevak sangh
 The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh is a branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of India
 tulsi gabord ko bada daan dene vaale ramesh bhutada hindu swayamsevak sangh ke upaadhyaksh hai
 Bhutada campaigned to win Modi from Texas
 baad main modi ke jeetne ke baad bhutada ne kaha tha ki yah bharat kii duusari aazaadee he

 The Yogi government has started clamping down on the disturbances in the Gomti River Front construction
 is maamle main 8 ejiniyaron ke khilaaf exiaar darj kii gai he
 The complaint was lodged by the Executive Engineer of the Irrigation Department at Gomtinagar police station in Lucknow on Monday evening
 sinchai vibhaag ke adhishasi abhiyantaa ne apane hi 8 ejiniyaron ke khilaaf ye shikaayat darj karai he
 FIR against these engineers: Gulesh Chand, Chief Engineer SN Sharma, then Chief Engineer Kazim Alimukh Engineer Shiv Mangal Yadav Yogi government has not yet formally handed it over to CBI is
 somvaar raat 8 afasaron par darj hue FIR ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki jald hi ise CBI ko saunp diya jayega
 This FIR has been lodged in the riverfront following the report of the inquiry committee of Urban Development Minister Suresh Khanna
 jaanch samiti ne yah mana he ki riverfrant maamle main ghotaalaa hua he
 The budget of the river front has been increased by leaps and bounds
 isamen behisaab paise kharch kiye gaye or manamaane dhang se tender baante gaye
 After this FIR, it is believed that the investigation of the River Front scam will also be handed over to the CBI
 river front main aniyamittaonki jaanch ke liye bani khanna cameti kii report ke baad is maamle se jude logon par shikanja kasnaa shuru ho gaya he
 The Khanna Committee recently submitted a status report to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 sutron ke mutabik, siem yogi ne maamle kii sibiai jaanch ko bhi hari jhandi de di he
 However, it has not been officially ordered
 ab 8 ejiniyaron ke khilaaf exiaar hone ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki jald hi maamle kii jaanchasibiaiko saunp di jaaegi

 har saal velentine de ke aasapaas ek massej viral hota he, jisamen kaha jaataa he ki 14 farvari ko velentine de ke rup main nahin, balki bhagat singh kii yaad main manaaya janaa chahie
 It is said that on 14 February 1931 the great revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged in a prison in Lahore
 saath hi kai massej main is din bhagat singh ko faansee sunaae jane kaa zikr hota he
 However, let us tell you that this message that has gone viral on social media is wrong
 23 march ko hui thi fonseeaitihaasik tathyon ke anusaar bhagat singh, raajaguru or sukhdev ko 14 farvari ko faansee nahin di gai thi, balki unhen 23 march ko faansee par latakaaya gaya tha
 The entire country is also celebrated as Martyr Day on 23 March
 kai reports main yah zikr jarur he ki in teen mahaan krantikariyon ko faansee dene kii taarikh 24 march 1931 tay kii gai thi, lekin achaanak hi unki faansee kaa samay badal kar 11 ghante pehle kar diya gaya or 23 march 1931 ko lahore jail main shaam 7:30 baje unhen faansee de di gai
 Bhagat Singh, who was reading these books in jail before the hanging, said in the sentencing message heard on this day, there is no claim to be hanged, but it is said to be hanged
 haalanki yah daawa bhi galat he, kyonki 7 oktober 1930 ko british court ne apane 300 pej kaa jajment sunaaya, jisamen bhagat singh, raajaguru or sukhdev ko sanders murder or essembly bam cond main doshi qaraar diya gaya or unhen faansee kii sajaa sunai gai
 To prove Bhagat Singh innocent, even after 86 years of execution, there is an ongoing legal battle
 Since February 14, the experts of history say that from February 14, Bhagat Singh's relationship is that on February 14, 1931, Madan Mohan Malviya ji hanged Just 41 days before that, a mercy petition was put in the office of Lord Irwin, Viceroy of British India, which was rejected by Irwin
 haalanki kai reports kaa kahana he ki itihaas main aise bhi kisi daawey kii pushti nahin hoti

 Former Pakistan cricketer Saeed Anwar congratulated Sachin Tendulkar on his double century and said that he was happy that his record was broken by this star batsman of India and hoped that he will go ahead with the problems of aging and make many records in the future
 
 anwar ne kaha ki agar tendulkar kii farm or fitness barkaraar rahati he to vah test main bhi tihara shatak jad saktaa he
 Anwar told Pakistan, 'I have no sorrow from breaking the record
 bajaay main bahut khush hum ki sachin tendulkar jaise mahaan khilaadi ne meraa ricard todaa
 i am very happy sachin jis tarah se khel rahaa he, use dekhte hue vah nishchit rup se iskaa hakdaar tha
 Tendulkar broke Anwar's 194-run record by scoring an unbeaten 200 against South Africa on Wednesday and became the first player to score a double century in the history of one-day cricket
 anwar ne 55 test or 247 vanade khele hai
 He said, "only players like Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar are expected to break such records and create new records
" vah is umr main bhi apni fitness ko barkaraar rakhkar adbhut pradarshan kar rahaa he
 This is qualitative
 ’anwar haalanki is baat se bhi do raay nahin rakhte ki tendulkar kii dhalati umr ricardon ke is badshaah kii raah main roda ban sakati he
 Regarding Tendulkar's triple century in the Test, he said, "there is no doubt that he is aging

 But it can be quite difficult for him, but if the same fitness and form continues, he can do it in his name

 Tendulkar can also do this on his own form
 ’ tendulkar 2011 vishwa cap main bharat ko khitaab dilaane kii ichha rakhte hai to unki yah ichha puri ho paayegi, is par anwar ne kaha, ‘abhi ek dedh saal kaa samay bachaa he
 Although Sachin pays great attention to his fitness, but age can be hindered to some extent
 yah sirf fitness par nirbhar karata he
 Asked if he would call this Tendulkar innings the best innings of his career, Anwar said, "certainly no one has done this feat in the history of ODI career, it would have been the best innings
" ’ anwar haalanki chaahate hai ki tendulkar nit naye ayaamon ko choote rahen or apane desh kaa naam roshan karte rahen
 He is happy to see that he has been playing continuously for the last 20 years and has seen the ups and downs of his cricket career
 lekin uske andar ranon kii bhukh barkaraar he
 There have been many records in his name, but he does not take the name of stopping
 mere paas uski tarif ke liye shabd nahin he
 'anwar said,' i wish him to play with this fitness and form in future
 ’ tendulkar kii pariyon main se unki pansadeeda pari poochne ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘yah sawaal to aapako tendulkar se poochna chahie, jaise meri pasandida paariyaan kisi or ko itani acchhee nahin lagi, lekin meri najar main ve kaaphi priy thi

 minesota main aisi hi 'het krime' vaali taaja ghatana main ek muslim chaatra kaa hijaab khinch liya gaya, saath hi uske bal pakad kar khol die
 The student was attacked by a student studying in her class
 ye sharmnaak ghatana minesota ke kun repids main northdel middle skool main shuukravaar ko hui
 The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has strongly condemned the attack
 CAIR ke mutabik chaatra ke gharavaalon ne ghatana kii use jaankaree di
 The family members said that the girl was standing in the school, when a classmate came from behind and pulled her hijab and threw it on the ground
 iske baad duusare students ke saamne us chaatra ke bal pakad kar khol die
 According to a Star Tribune report, CAIR alleges that the school district did not respond to the incident until Tuesday
 CAIR ke minesota chapter ke akjicutive diarector jailani hossain ne ek bayaan me kaha ki skool adhikariyon ko tatkaal karrwai kerani chahie jisase ki bina kisi dharmik yaa jaateey bhedbhaav ke sabhi students ke liye surakshit shiksha kaa maahaul sunishchit kiya ja sake
 Hussain said that after such an attack on a student, one should not spend so many days in action
 hossain ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki aaropee hamalavar or muslim chaatraon ke saath bhi badasluki karata rahaa he
 School District spokesman Jim Scalley has confirmed the incident

 Simultaneously, efforts are also being made to find out where the link between the parents of the school and the student has been broken
 scally ke mutabik skool district ke adhikariyon ne is sambandh main CAIR se sampark saadhaa he
 The district said in a statement, "the way CAIR has presented the incident does not match the district's opinion
 praarambhik jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki ye apwaad vaali ghatana he or pakshpaat se prerit nahin he
 "let me tell you that last week a Muslim student of Michigan University was threatened by an unknown person shouting that if he did not remove the hijab, he would burn her alive
 police us ghatana ko bhi het krime maanate hue jaanch kar rahi he lekin sandigdh ko abhi tak pakadaa nahin ja sakaa he
 While that Muslim student has left that area and gone elsewhere

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke america se lautne ke pehle soshal media par america congress ke bahaane purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh laut aae
 Manmohan Singh would not have even imagined his return on social media
 america congress main pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke dauraan baji taaliyon kii ginati kya hui unke aalochak purana record dekhne lage ki sahi main kisi ke liye pehali baar tali baji he kya
 Started searching for Manmohan Singh on youtube
 media main pradhanmantri modi kaa bhaashan khatm hote hi bhaashan se zyaada ye baaten chalane lagi ki aath yaa nau baar america saansadon ne khadey hokar sammaan jataayaa to tees yaa taintis baar samuhik taaliyaan baji
 Every time such an act happens by the devotees, all the talk of the Prime Minister's foreign trip is lost either in the count of clap or in the number of people who come to the stadium to listen
 bhaashan main videsh niti ke tatv peeche rah jate hai
 As soon as the applause and standing became stronger, the devotees started searching for the July 2005 video on anti-youtube
 jab purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne america congress ko sambodhit kiya tha
 a variety of competition ensued
 pehali baar modi ke muqaabale manmohan singh ko laayaa gaya
 People have also started sharing his speeches on social media
 kai feed main pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke saath saath manmohan singh ke bhaashan kaa bhi link aa jaataa he
 i also watched this video
 unke sammaan main bhi america congress ke saansad der tak tali bajaate rahe
 While watching this video i got bored and wondered why people are clapping for so long
 mehmaan ke pravesh karte hi sammaan main thodi der kii tali to samaj aati he lekin aisa laga ki baqayda saansadon se kaha gaya ho ki kuch bhi ho jaae lambey samay tak tali bajaani he
 Manmohan Singh has arrived in the House, has reached the stage to speak, has stood up and now wants to speak but the clap is going on
 koi tuk nahin he
 Just being played
 shaayad vahaan kii parampara hogi
 The loud sound must also have been practiced like a footstep
 baharhaal manmohan singh ke video ko lekar muqaabala hone laga
 The conduct of devotees and devout opponents became the same
 haalat ye ho gai ki pradhanmantri modi kii angreji ke uccharan par betuki tippaniyan hone lageen
 It started being ridiculed that the Prime Minister read English written on the teleprompter
 is lihaaz se to angrezi ke tamaam vidwaan ankar kaarij ho jaaen jo kai saal se camere ke neeche lage telepromptor par dekh kar angrezi padhate hai
 We Hindi people also study like this in studios
 aisa hi chalata rahaa to soshal media kaa yah match bharat kii saarvajanik raajnneetik samskruti kaa sarvanaash karke dam legaa
 However, videos from Jawaharlal Nehru to Atal Bihari Vajpayee with Manmohan Singh were removed
 magar in teenon main zyaada jagah mili manmohan singh ke video ko
 Any technical expert can tell what presence of Manmohan Singh was on social media compared to Modi in the last 48 hours
 unka video pradhanmantri modi ke bhaashan ke video ko bhale na pachhad paaya ho magar jahaan jahaan unka video he uske aasapaas manmohan singh kaa bhi he
 The comments yahaan tak akhabaaron main bhi america congress main hue donon ke bhaashanon kii khub tulana hui he
 The Economic Times has weighed down that Prime Minister Modi used 15 per cent fewer words than Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh ne apane tatkaaleen purvavarti atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa naam na lekar jawahar laal nehru kaa naam liya to modi ne unka naam na lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa liya
 In this way, for the first time, Manmohan Singh was seen finding a place against Modi
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan modi kii aandhi main manmohan singh khar-patavaar kii tarah ud gaye
 Prime Minister Modi also attacked more by speaking the mother-son government
 purv pradhanmantri par bahut kam hamalaa kiya
 In January that year, Manmohan Singh held a press conference
 das saal ke kaarykram main unki wo teesri or aakiri press vaarta thi
 He then said that "history will be more liberal towards me than contemporary media"
 manmohan singh ji apni is vaapasi par muskura sakate hai magar shukriya itihaas kaa nahin soshal media kaa kahiyegaa! or haa ye udaartaa ke nattejey main nahin hua he balki ek kism kii kattarta ke jawaab main duusare kism kii kattarta se hua he

 However, there was a fight against Manmohan Singh's video
 bhakt or bhakt virodhiyon kaa aacharan ek samaan ho gaya
 The situation became such that absurd comments were made on Prime Minister Modi's English pronunciation
 mazaaq udaaya jane laga ki dekho pradhanmantri telepromptor par likhi angreji padhate hai
 In this context, all English scholar anchors should be dismissed, who for many years read English by looking at the teleprompter under the camera
 ham hindivaale bhi studio main aise hi padhate hai
 If this continues, then this match on social media will kill the public political culture of India
 baharhaal manmohan singh ke saath jawahar laal nehru se lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi tak ke video nikaal liye gaye
 But Manmohan Singh's video got more space in these three
 koi takniki jaankaar bataa saktaa he ki soshal media par pichley 48 ghante main modi kii tulana main manmohan singh kii kya upasthiti rahi
 His video may not be able to beat the video of Prime Minister Modi's speech, but wherever his video is, there is also Manmohan Singh around it
 tippaniyan Even in the newspapers, the speeches of both of them in the US Congress have been compared very well
 iconomik times ne baqayda taul kar bataaya he ki pradhanmantri modi ne manmohan singh kii tulana main 15 pratishat kam shabdon kaa istamaal kiya
 Manmohan Singh did not take the name of his then predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jawaharlal Nehru, while Modi did not take his name as Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 is tarah pehali baar modi ke muqaabale manmohan singh jagah pate nazar aae
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Manmohan Singh flew like a weed in Modi's storm
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi maa bete kii sarkaar bol kar hi zyaada hamalaa kiya
 Very few attacked the former Prime Minister
 us saal janvari main manmohan singh ne ek press conference kiya tha
 This was his third and final press conference in a ten-year program
 tab unhone kaha tha ki "samakaleen media kii tulana main mere prati itihaas zyaada udaar hoga"
 Manmohan Singh ji can smile on his return, but thanks social media will say no to history! And yes this has not happened as a result of generosity but in response to one type of bigotry
