 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, serving a 5-year sentence, is currently lodged in Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi
 lalu ke bade bete or purv swasthya mantri tejpratap yadav kaa maananaa he ki lalu ke saath anyaay hua he or unhen nyaay dilaane ke liye ab jan andolan karne kii jarurat he
 Tej Pratap Yadav said that the way the revolution was started in the country through the JP (jayaprakash) movement in the 70s, the LP (lalu Prasad) movement is now needed in Bihar
 taaki lalu or garibon ko insaaf mil sake
 Hitting the same thinking of Tej Pratap Yadav, JDU has said that while the JP Movement was started to save democracy, the LP Movement's sole purpose is to save corrupt people like Lalu Prasad
 jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki el pi movement kaa ekmaatr makasad lalu prasad yadav ko bachaana he jo is vakt bhrashtachar ke aarope main ranchi ke birsa munda jail main band he
 Sanjay Singh said that while thousands of young people had put their future at stake in the JP movement, it could change the future of the country, on the other hand, the purpose of the ALP movement is greed, corruption, scandal and benefit of a select few
 argedy par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki party ko yah samajhnaa padegaa ki lalu prasad kisi aazaadee kii ladaai main jail nahin gaye hai, balkibhrashtacharor akut sampatti jamaa karne ke aarope main jail main band he
 Sanjay Singh appealed to the RJD leaders to consider what was the motive of JP Movement and what is the purpose of LP Movement? Sanjay Singh said that leaders like Lalu Prasad never change and he still remains in government The system has been abused as before
 jadyu ne is baat ko lekar bhi aashaa vyakt kii ki lalu ke jail jane ke baad argedy ne badi tut hogi
 The party believes that senior RJD leaders like Jagadanand Singh, Shivanand Tiwari, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Ramchandra Poorve will not accept the leadership of leaders like Tejashwi Yadav in the coming days who have not even passed the tenth
 jadyu ne kaha ki argedy ke kai vidhayak or parshad ab party main nahin rahanaa chaahate hai or sabase zyada pareshaani un netaaon ko ho rahi he jo eemaandaar he kyonki jab vah apane kshetra main jaaenge to unhen is baat kaa jawaab dete nahin banegaa ki vah kaise lalu prasad jaise bhrasht netaa kaa samarthan kar rahe hai ? When elections come, the leaders do not know what to remember
 jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai ki desh ke tamaam khel sanghon par kisi na kisi party ke netaa kaa kabja he
 But now Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has realized this
 rahul ne kaha he ki sabhi rajanetaaon ko khelon se dur rakhana chahie or khel sansthaaon kaa sanchaalan khilaadiyon ko hi karnaa chahie
 The occasion was the launch of 'national Youth Policy 2014' and 'rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan' and on this occasion, Rahul said, "if we talk about sports and how to make it available to more and more people, then about sports in the country More and more powers should be given to the people associated with sports to decide
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yahi iskaa mul bindu he
 If you want to say it directly, then politicians should be kept away from sports
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki yah vaisaa hi he jaise desh kii raajnneeti main badlaav main madad ke liye aam aadmi ko adhikaar dena
 He said, 'the same rule applies in politics
 agar aap desh main raajnneeti ko badalanaa chaahate ho to yuvaaon ko adhik se adhik adhikaar do, aam aadmi ko adhik adhikaar do or aap raajnneeti ko badal doge
 'centrally sponsored schemes National Youth Policy 2014 and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan were launched today at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here
 khel mantri jitendra singh, mairicam, vijender singh, pulela gopichand, ashvini nachppa, ranjan sodhi or karnam malleshwari is dauraan maujuud the
 Both these programs were launched simultaneously at the district headquarters and university level across the country
 isi mudde par india today ne july 2013 ke apane ek ank main ek aalekh chapa thi jiskaa sheershak tha 'khel sangh: jab tak chalegi saans, ye tike rahenge

 Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said, "we have finalized our view on spectrum price and soon the Telecom Commission will consider the matter and after the decision of Telecom Commission, i will go to the Cabinet for consensus
" doorsanchaar niamak tri ne is saal farvari maheene main shuruuaati spectrum ke saath bharti, vodaphone, idia, beasenel tathaa emtnael jaisi companiyon dwaara 6
 a six-fold increase in the cost was recommended for companies holding spectrum beyond the 2 mhz limit

 45 karod rupee hogi jo purv 1,658 karod rupee thi

 2 megahatrj se adhik spectrum rakhane vaale par prati ek spectrum ke liye 4,571
 It will cost Rs 87 crore
 yah puche jane par ki kya doorsanchaar vibhaag manjuuri ke liye maamle ko vishesh taur par mantrimandal ke paas le ja rahaa he, sibbal ne kaha, aisa nahin he
 i think the Cabinet should also be informed about the general policy decision and that is what we want

 yah anusandhan ‘medical research council’ ke ‘neshnal survey of health and development’ ne kiya he
 According to this, once you become obese, your weight increases back despite all the efforts to lose weight
 iske liye shodhakartaaon ne varsh 1946 main janme 5,362 logon tathaa varsh 1958 main janme 20,000 logon par shodh kiya he
 According to the news published in the Daily Mail, they found that the weight of women and men increases with age

 The BCCI, however, has not formally announced Pant's name
 use ummid he ki dhawan do se teen saptaah ke andar chot se ubar jaaenge
 When the team was selected for the World Cup, Pant was ignored by the selectors and Dinesh Karthik was selected
 pant ko ab board ne england jane ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha he
 However, the 21-year-old will not be available for selection in the beginning as Pant will only get a chance after taking a final decision on Dhawan
 dhawan ke anguuthe main fracture he or is kaaran vah teen saptaah ke liye maidan se dur ho sakate hai
 It is feared that he will not be able to play two matches with New Zealand and Pakistan

 Russia's plane crashed in Egypt on Saturday
 224 musafiron ke saath misr ke sharmal shaikh innaranational airport se rus ke saint peterberg jane ke liye ude russian airline metroget kii udaan sankhya KGL 9268 main kya bam rakhaa hua tha? yaa phir vimaan ko jameen se hawa main maar karne vaale anti aircraft gan se maar giraaya gaya? ye sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki vimaan ke blike box kii shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki haadasa kisi takneekee kharabi kii vajah se nahin hua he
 Flight airline KGL9268 from the beautiful airport on the Red Sea was preparing for takeoff
 plane main 217 musafir or 7 kru members samet kul224 logasavar the
 These included 63 men, 138 women and 17 children
 misr ke is shahar se isplene ko ruske saint pitsburg pahunchnaa tha
 As soon as the initial takeoff formalities were completed and the signal from ATC to proceed on the runway, the airplane started running at full speed on the runway, and started talking to the air on sight
 techoff ke saath hawaii jahaaj agle chand minuton main hi kareeb 30 hajaar feet kii oonchai par udne laga
 Due to the clear weather, there was no misfortune in the flight either
 thik 23 minute baad achaanak plane kaa sampark air trephic control yani atisi se tut gaya
 The last contact of the aircraft was with Turkish ATC
 uske baad ise cyprus ke atisi ke sampark me hona tha lekin aisa nahin hua
 During this time, the route of the aircraft and all the atcs attached to it were searched but no sound of aircraft was found
 vimaan kaa turki or cyprus kii hawaii seemaa ke aasapaas hi atisi se sampark tuutane ke baad un ilaakon kii sena ko bhi alert kar diya gaya
 On the other hand, the Russian plane fell into the hills of Sinai at the same time after losing contact with ATC
 aasapaas kii aabaadi ko is plane krash kaa jaise hi pataa chalaa to unhone isaki khabar sarkari adhikariyon ko di
 Rescuers who arrived on the spot were surprised to see the wreckage of the airplane as the debris was scattered across the entire area of nine kilometers
 aisa tabhi mumkin he jab vimaan hawa main hi haadase kaa shikaar ho hua ho
 So was there a blast in the plane or was it broken at the height of the plane? a large area around the area of sinai Penisula where the airplane went missing in the air is occupied by the terrorists of the Islamic State ie ISIS
 to kya plane kaa krash kisi aatankwaadi sajeesh kaa nateeja tha? ye sawaal isliye kyonki pichley maheene bhar se rus lagaataar aies ke thikaane par hamalaa kar rahaa he
 But the second question also arises whether IS has the weapons to shoot down a passenger aircraft at such an altitude? However, only hours after the plane crash, IS claimed that the Russian passenger plane had killed it
 lekin rus philhal ise puri tarah maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Russian agencies believe that the aircraft has crashed due to technical fault
 haalanki isi ke sathrusee raashtrapati putinaney ek immergency tin bana kar maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh bhi de die hai
 When the expert investigated, some things were found shocking
 vimaan ke pichley hisse kii body andar se baahar kii taraf nikal rahi thi
 This happens only when a powerful bomb explodes
 jabaki jameen par girane ke baad vimaan kii body ko andar kii taraf dhansa hona chahie
 Experts believe that there was a blast in the air inside
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki vimaan ke do tukade aasmaan main to hue par wo tukade jameen se daage gaye missile kii vajah se hue
 But the missile hit from ground to sky is possible up to 23000 feet
 jabaki haadase ke vakt vimaan 30 hajaar feet kii oonchai par tha
 After taking the flight, the pilot spoke about emergency landing due to technical fault and immediately lost contact with him
 jabaki malbe se mili vimaan keblike boxki shuruaati jaanch bataa rahi he ki vimaan main koi anduruni takneekee kharabi nahin thi
 Experts said after the initial investigation of the incident, it is very possible that there is a conspiracy like a bomb blast in the air behind this accident
 kyonki sinai ke registan main hawaii jahaaj kaa jo pichhlaa hissaa mila he, uske kuch tukade andar se baahar kii ore mude hue hai
 The hint is that the bombing was placed inside the ship in the rear
 lekin phir sawaal ye he ki aakhir itani kadi suraksha ke baavjood ye kaise sambhav hua? haadase ke peeche bam plant karne jaisi sajeesh he to abjaanch agenciyonke liye ye pataa karnaa jaruri he ki jisane plane main bam rakhaa wo koun tha? kya wo khud bhi suicide bombar kii tarah hawaii jahaaz main savaar hua tha yaa phir bam rakh kar chupchaap utar gaya?

 Yes, Priyanka Gandhi is talking
 congress main ye to tay he ki party ke bos der saver rahul gandhi hi banenge
 But will Priyanka be out of Rae Bareli and Amethi in UP elections? How much will be active if you leave? The answers to these questions are now coming down slowly
 pehle sakaaratmak sanket, phir tasviir or ab nai taarikhupi chunaav se pehle tak priyanka kii bhoomika ke sawaal par congress sirf itnaa kahati thi ki unki bhoomika raibareli or amethi main simit he or unke bhavishya kaa faisla gandhi parivaar legaa
 But as soon as the new team was announced for the UP elections, General Secretary in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the Congressmen of UP demand that Priyanka be active outside ameth-rae Bareli and when i told this to Priyanka ji, she gave positive signals
 iske baad ye to tay ho gaya ki priyanka kii bhoomika badhane vaali he
 Fresh indications were received when party leaders also put up posters outside Amethi Rae Bareli
 sutron ne bataaya ki alaakaman kaa sandesh he ki priyanka kii tasviir poster main shart ke saath laga sakate hai
 But the condition is that his picture should not be the only poster and it is smaller than Rahul's picture

 But at the same time, we have talked about waiting for the right time, due to which the announcement is not being made at the moment, so officially no leader is ready to open his mouth

 Read yourself what the court remarked while delivering the verdict
 
 
 
 
 sibiai court ke nyaayadhish kii tippaneesibiai kii special court ke nyaayadhish opi saini ne2g ke aropiyon ko barikarte hue kaha ki main saat varshon tak saboot kaa intjaar karata rahaa
 Every day of court action
 
 
 
 Even in summer holidays
 
 
 
 i kept sitting in the court every day from 10 am to 5 pm waiting to bring any legal evidence, but no one came up with evidence so that i could sentence the accused
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki sabhi aam dharna (public Perception) se chal rahe the, jo sirf afvaahon, gapbaajee or atakalbaajiyon se gadhi gai thi
 He said that Public Perception does not matter in court proceedings
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki maamle main shuruyaat main abhiyojan ne behad utsaah dikhaaya, lekin cese aage badhane ke saath hi yah samajhnaa mushkil ho gaya ki aakhirkaar abhiyojan paksh sabit kya karnaa chahta he
 Not only this, as the case progressed further, the prosecution became directionless and skeptical
 trial ke aakhri charan main abhiyojan paksh se koi varisht adhikari javaabon par dastakhat karne tak ko taiyaar nahin tha
 More importantly, the special public prosecutor was not ready to sign the document, which he himself filed in the court
 aise main court bina hastakshar vaale aise dastavej kaa kya kare? koi adhikari jaanch kii jimmedaari hi nahin lene ko taiyaar tha
 Many officials wrote notes on files in such poor handwriting that they could not be read and understood
 iskaa makasad maamle ko uljhaana tha
 Judge Sunderlal Tripathi of the film Jolly LLB commented, "every person sitting in this court knows that the accident is done by Rahul Dewan (rajiv Siddhant), but it doesn't matter who thinks what?" i have to give a judgment, based on evidence
 
 
 
 And evidence does not come
 cese kii pehali taarikh ko mujhe maaloom hota he ki mujrim koun he? main yahaan baitha rahata hum
 
 
 And i keep waiting for evidence (evidence)
 avidence ab aayega
 
 
 
 avidence ab aayega
 Files go up on files, but not a single paper comes before me that i can truly say that it is evidence
 avidence aata nahin he

 In Bihar, Leader of the Opposition and former Deputy Chief Minister of the state Tejashwi Yadav never misses a pinch on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone nitish kumaar ke notebandi par die gaye bayaan ko sharp you-turn bataaya
 He said that it takes a lot of time for Nitish Kumar to understand the issue and if he now declares demonetisation as the biggest scam then there will be no surprise in it
 bataa den ki nitish kumaar ne bankers samiti dwaara yojit 64veen tremasik samiksha baithak main kaha tha ki notebandi ke dauraan kuch baikon ne sahi tarah apni bhoomika nahin nibhaai, jisaki vajah se aam janata kaa paisa kahaan se kahaan pahunch gaya
 He said that money is collected from the poor, but what about powerful people who disappear by taking loans? He said that due to the role of banks, people could not get the benefit of demonetization as much as they should have

 film kaa naam:detective byomakesh bakhshidiarector:dibaakar banerjeestar cast:sushant singh rajput, anand tiwari, swastika mukherjee, niraj kabi, meyang chaing, divya mendevadhi:150
 54 mins Certificates: u / a Rating: 3 Star director Dibakar Banerjee misses 'khosla ka Ghosla' as soon as his name comes up
 yaad aati he 'oy lucky lucky oy', 'lav sex or dhokhaa' or 'shanghai' jaisi filmein
 Every film is different from each other
 ek duusare se juda or ab dibaakar ne bengali lekhak shardendu bandyopadhyaay kii kahaniyon ke kirdaar 'byomakesh bakshi' ko jeevant karne kii koshish kii he
 In an attempt to reconcile the murder mystery with Byomkesh, Dibakar has brought Calcutta of 1942 alive on screen
 aksar murder mistry par bani acchhee hindi filmon main kahani ke aage badhane ke saath suspence bhi dilachasp hota jaataa he
 Till the end, we keep guessing whether Radha's uncle has been murdered
 By the way, Dibakar has kept some such secret in his latest film as well
 aakhir main film ke ant ham tak ek sarprise kii tarah pahunchataa he
 The story of the film, a classmate Ajit Bandyopadhyay (anand Tiwari) from Byomkesh Bakshi (sushant Singh Rajput), studying at Vidya Sadan College, Calcutta in November 1942, speaks of the sudden disappearance of one of his acquaintances
 byomakesh use dhundhane kaa man banaata he or yah khoj ek murder mistry main tabdeel ho jaati he
 Byomkesh seeks help from people around to solve the mystery
 film main byomakesh kaa paala alag-alag kirdaaron jaise anguri devi (swastika mukherjee), dow
 The friendly falls from the cavity (neeraj Kabi)
 lekin kya vaaki kisi ke gaayab hone kii yah daastaan ek murder mistry he? kya byomakesh apane ajit kii madad kar paata he? yah or aise saare sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye aapako cinema haul tak janaa hoga
 Dibakar Banerjee's two films in this film are old Sushant Singh Singh Rajput, who has been proficient in playing his character as well as maintaining continuity
 vahiin, unke dost ke rup main anand tiwari ne film or kahani kii maang ke mutabik kaam kiya he
 The famous Bengal actress Swastika Mukherjee has lit every single frame as Anguri Devi
 vah ek pal ko film 'da train' kii hellen kii yaad dilaati hai
 Her entry in the first frame is in a swim suit and Swastika has proved her character well in the film
 dow
 Actor Neeraj Kabi as a favorable cavity has influenced a lot
 samvaad or pradarshan kii badaulat niraj sabase utkrisht rup main najar aae hai
 Even before this film, Neeraj had presented a Mujahra of excellent acting in Ship Of Theseus
 divya menon or meyang chaing ne bhi apane-apane kirdaar ko nibhaane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 This story of Dibakar is a bit long and sometimes seems to be drawn more than necessary
 lagbhag dhai ghante kii ye film thodi or choti ho sakati thi
 In the film, the incident like the attack on Calcutta, Japan, has just come out with a touch
 jaahir taur par unka sara dhyaan sirf murder mistry ko sulajhane main laga hua he
 That is, in the film, you will get to spend more and more time with Byomkesh
 dibaakar ne film main 1942 ke kalakatta ko jis baariki se dikhaaya he vah tarif ke kaabil he
 From toothbrush to shaving with a knife
 haath se khaanaa
 Method of turning the betel leaf
 akhbaar, ghadi, chashma sabakuch jaise usee daura kaa ho
 Even the song playing in the background, 'yeh din nahin, agar hum saath nahin', also reminds us of the same era
 kai hafton baad is veekend darshakon ko parde ek murder mistry ke bich samay gujaarne kaa mauka mila he
 You have many reasons to watch the film
 sushant singh rajput, dibaakar banerjee kaa mail jabardast he
 But the most affected is Neeraj Kabi
 uttarakhand main ek baar phir jangalon main aag lagane kaa sankat saamne aayaa he
 In the last few days, the fire in the forests has been spreading continuously, the fire has taken the hill as well as the plains
 bigadate halaat ko dekhte hue adhikariyon kii chhuttiyaan bhi radd kar di gai hai
 The forest department says that the department is worried about the fire incident, several teams have been formed to overcome it
 vibhaag ke mutabik, unki puri koshish jaanwaron or jangal ko bachaana he
 Villagers believe that forest fire is also happening due to lack of information of villagers
 kuch log jalati hui bidi-cigarette ko hi jangalon main chalate hue phenk dete hai, jisase aag lagati he or baad main fail jaati he
 The forest department is on alert in view of the fierce fire in the forests of Kumaon
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch dinon se kumaun main bageshwar, bhimtal ke jangalon main baari aag he
 The Chief Conservator of Forests himself has taken command in view of the raging fires in the forests
 kumaun daure par nikle van sangrakshak ne kaha ki adhikari puri tarah alert hai or halaat niyantran main he
 To get control of the fire, the leave of all officers and employees of the forest department has also been banned

 Fire in Sankat Jungles on Chardham Yatra has erupted in 8 districts of Devbhoomi and there is a danger of it on Chardham Yatra
 tehri jhil ke upar dhuen ke bade se gubaar se yatra maarg par aag kaa jabardast tandav he
 Now coming to the land of Uttarakhand from home and abroad, providing security to Chardham pilgrims has become a challenge for the government
 garmiyon main uttarakhand ke jangalon main aag koi nai baat nahin he
 But surprisingly, so far the effort to overcome this has not been successful
 karodon kii sampatti kaa nuksaan to ho hi rahaa he
 The danger is also that people and animals may not be affected by it
 ayushmaan khurana kii film bala kaa trailor relies ho gaya he

 Please tell that Tatsapi and Bhoomi have played the role of two old and popular shooters of Haryana
 gauratlab he ki bala film ek shaks ke bare main he jiske bal khatm ho gaye hai or kaise wo wig ke sahare ek ladki ko impress karne kii koshish karata he
 Bhoomi will play the character of a girl in this film who walks away from the standards of society and creates a new definition for beauty

 With the Conservative Party getting a majority, Britain seems to be moving on the path of exit from the European Union (EU)

 The Conservative Party is projected to get 368 seats and the Labor Party 191 seats

 Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a breakthrough and wants to separate Britain from the European Union
 britain abeuropea sanghase alag hona chahta he
 The UK Parliament and the public are divided into two parts on this issue
 europea sansad bhi bracit ke maamle main faisla lene main asamarth rahi he
 So it is important to understand what is the breakthrough and what is the upheaval in this case
 kya he bracit?bracit yani britain+eczit
 Brexit simply means Britain's exit from the European Union
 puri duniya main is baat ko lekar asamanjas he ki britain ab EU main rahegaa yaa nahin
 The trends in Boris Johnson's party suggest that he will separate Britain from the European Union
 kyon uthi bracit kii mangabata den ki isaki shuruyaat 2008 main hui jab britain kiarthvyavasthaamandi kii chapet main aa gai thi
 Inflation had increased in the country, unemployment had increased, efforts were being made to find a solution and fix the economy
 isi bich united kingdom independence party (eukeipi) ne 2015 main ho rahe chunaavon ke dauraan yah mudda uthaaya ki europea union britain kii aarthik mandi ko kam karne ke liye kuch nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that it is because of this that the situation in Britain is continuously deteriorating
 us dauraan aarthik mandi ko kaaran maanate hue vajah bataai gai ki britain ko har saal european union ke bajet ke liye 9 arab dollar dene hote hai
 Because of this, people settle in Britain without hindrance
 free vija policy se britain ko baari nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Brexit was opposed as well, on the contrary, many people in Britain are aware of the benefits from the European Union and call Brexit's decision wrong
 bracit kaa virodh karne vaale logon kii daleel he ki isse duusare europea deshon se kaarobaar par bura asar hoga
 Britain's single market system will end and Britain's GDP will suffer
 david camran ke baad bane donon piemteresa meorboris johnsonne bracit ko apana mudda banaaya or ise lagu karne kii shart par pradhanmantri kaa padbar sambhala
 But of these, Teresa failed to win a majority on Brexit and had to resign
 2016 main britain main janamat sangrah hua tha, jisamen bahumat britain kaa europea union se alag hone ke paksh main tha
 The then Cameron government had to resign following the trend of a referendum on Brexit
 tab kanjarvative party kii terresa me kii aguwai main sarkaar bani
 But she could not muster the necessary support for Brexit and resigned from her post
 iske baad boris johnson pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee thi
 Steps will be taken on their own terms However, if the final results also come as exit polls, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson will separate from the European Union on its own terms
 britain kii grih mantri priti patel kah chuki hai ki nai sarkaar bracit lagu karne ke liye teji se kadam uthaaegi
 According to him, the bill will be introduced in Parliament before Christmas

 Hearing the dangers of child marriage, the 17-year-old girl refused to marry, seeing Shayra could not stay away
 unhone faisla kiya ki ve in bacchon ke jivan main sudhaar laaengi
 At that time she left Pushkar
 lekin ek hi maheene baad emstardam (holland kii rajdhani) se waapas pushkar ain
 To find out what she can do for those children
 During her stay in Pushkar, Shaira came to know that the people of the Nat community live by begging
 unke bachche to chhodie, unke mata-pita bhi kabhi skool nahin gaye
 Everybody makes money by playing tricks on the streets
 pard raheen-bad raheen betiyaan, bal vivaah kii bali chadhane main 51% kii giravatfir shaayara ne faisla kiya ki wo in bacchon kii padhai-likhaai ke liye kaam karengi

 taaki ye bachche is skool main pard saken
 The principal of the school, Giriraj Gujariya, told that an 11-12 year old girl is not coming to school for a month
 uske saath uske bhai-bahan bhi nahin aa rahe hai

 unki fasebuk post kaa tital hi he- dow
 What advice should Manmohan Singh give to his party? So Jaitley wrote something like this: - Speak - Give powerful messages to the Congress, the former PM and the President speak very rarely

 Especially his concern that the Prime Minister and the government are working without taking opinion from the opposition
 unhen lagata he ki arthvyavastha ke liye sarkaar ke prayaas naakaafi hai
 i am confident that if Manmohan does a fair analysis of the current government, he will feel that there is a government in India where the words of the PM are the final decision

 It was said that Manmohan Nemanmohan Singh had said in a special conversation with India Today that due to the attitude of the government, public confidence has been removed

 shuukravaar ko subah se puure desh kii nigahen mumbai par tiki thim kyonki bombai hai court main superstarasalmaan khanki jamaanat par sunwaayee honi thi
 Meanwhile, Congress vice-president Ahul Gandhi, who runs his politics from Delhi, arrives in Mumbai to appear in a case in which he was given exemption a day before the Supreme Court to appear
 sawaal to uthne hi the or uthe bhi ki kya ye congress upaadhyaksh kaa publiciteastanttha?publicity stantmana ja rahaa he ki puure desh kii nigaah mumbai par thi isliye rahul gandhi jaanboojhkar chhot milane ke baavjood adaalat main pesh hue, taaki salmaan maamle ke bich unhen bhi charchaa or publicity mil jaae
 Because on Wednesday, he saw clearly how the entire nation's media was clearly hovering around the sessions court and Salman Khan
 salmaan kaa stilrahul gandhi ne adaalat main pesh hone ke baad kaha ki main jo bhi kamitment karata hum, use puraa karata hum
 It seems that Rahul Gandhi must have remembered that famous dialogue of Salman - once i have committed, i do not even listen to myself
 aakraamak andaajarahul gandhi jab se lagbhag do maheene kii chhuttiyaan manaakar videsh se laute hai, tab se ve sansad ke andar or baahar har jagah bilkul aakraamak avatar main najar aa rahe hai

 shivasena ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi) ke liye bhagwaan ram (ram Mandir Issue) kanoon se bade nahin hai
 This is because PM Modi said in an interview that his government will decide on an ordinance for the construction of Ram Mandir issue only after the judicial process is over
 bataa den ki shivasena ne ayodhya main mandir nirmaan kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye adhyadesh laane kii maang kii he
 He has argued that the case has been going on in the courts for decades
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne twit kiya, ‘‘ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki ram mandir tatkaal (sunwaayee vaala) maamla nahin he
 PM Modi also did not say anything different
 main unhen maamle par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye badhai detaa hum
 The Prime Minister (PM Modi) says that Ram will not bring any ordinance for the temple
 iskaa sanvaidhanik arth yah he ki bhagwaan ram kanoon se bade nahin hai
 It is noteworthy that in an interview broadcast by various television channels, PM Modi was questioned about the demand of various Hindutva groups to bring ordinance for Ram temple in Ayodhya
 is sawaal ke jawaab main piem modi ne kaha tha ki nyaayik prakriya samaapt hone dijiye
 After the judicial process is over, whatever our responsibility as a government, we are all ready to try
 dhyaan ho ki shivasena ne ramamandir mudde ko lekar apana rukh kadaa kar liya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had last month at a rally in Maharashtra's Solapur district asked BJP allies to clarify their stand on the Ram temple issue
 gauratlab he ki ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii maang ko lekar hone vaali dharm sansad se thik pehle shiv sena pramukh uddhav thakare (uddhav Thackeray) ne kaha tha ki centre sarkaar ke paas puraa adhikaar he ki vah is baar ram mandir kaa nirmaan karaae
 If she does not do so, i can tell you with a claim that this government will not be formed again
 lekin ram mandir jarur banegaa
 He had said that when i was going to visit Ramlala, i had a thought whether i was going to visit Ramlala or someone was going to jail
 thakare ne centre sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki beete chaar saal main sarkaar ne ek baar bhi aisi koshish nahin kii ki vah ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho
 Now that the elections are near, she is playing with the feelings of the Hindus
 unhone is dauraan purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bhi yaad kiya tha
 Uddhav had said that Atal ji had said that the Hindu will not eat
 main maanata hum ki us samay atal ji kii mili juli sarkaar thi isliye chaah kar bhi ram mandir ke liye kuch nahin kar paae lekin ab to centre main purna bahumat kii sarkaar he
 Uddhav Thakar had said that i had heard that CM Yogi Ji said that the temple was, is and will remain
 ye to hamaari dharana he, hamaari bhaavana he
 Sadly, it is not visible
 wo mandir dikhegaa kab
 It should be constructed as soon as possible

 The Aam Aadmi Party said that if the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) did not withdraw the decision to increase the fare, they would strongly oppose it

 It is being said from the metro that the metro is running at a loss
 isliye kiraaya badhanaa jaruri he
 There are some questions from the Metro of the Aam Aadmi Party
 
 
 1
 The fare was increased in May, then what has the Metro done in 6 months, which is again increasing the fare
 2

 After increasing the fare, the ridership was reduced to 25 lakhs
 phir bhi metro ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Why is it not being thought about? dobaar kiraaya badhaane se phir ridership ghategi
 bjp's opposition to the AAP said that on December 2, a delegation of Aam Aadmi mlas would go to the DMRC and talk about it, on the same day, the BJP has called it a complete drama

 At the same time, the committee met in May to increase the rent

 " chhattisgarh main sibiai kii ek closer report se ek baar phir raajnneeti garma gai he
 The case dates back to 2003 when the then Chief Minister Ajit Jogi was caught in the case of sale of BJP mlas
 is dauraan bijepi netaa rajnath singh, arun jetali, sanjay joshi or doctor raman singh ke jariye vidhayakon ko di gai 45 lakh kii rakam kii jabti karai gai or use police ko saunpa gaya tha
 The then Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani had directed a CBI inquiry into the case of horse trading by BJP mlas
 sibiai ne apni jaanch main shadyantr to paaya lekin saboot ke abhaav main 2012 or janvari 2017 main closer report adaalat ko saunp di
 As a result Ajit Jogi was acquitted in the case
 ab yah maamla nae sire se uth gaya he
 Virendra Pandey, the original complainant of the case, has filed before the Chhattisgarh High Court that when Jogi is not guilty, he should be arrested by registering a case of conspiracy against all BJP leaders
 vidhayak kharid farokhtamaamle main purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi ko clin chit diye jane ke khilaaf virendra pandeya ne hoicourt main yachika daayar kii he | unhonen is maamle main sibiai ke closer report ko chunauti dete hue maamle ke naye sire se jaanch kii maang kii he
 Pandey has said in his petition that if Jogi is innocent, then Virendra Pandey as well as the then Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley and Dr
 Raman Singh should be prosecuted
 maamla 2003 kaa he jab vidhayak kharid-farokht maamle ko virendra pandeya ne hi ujagar kiya tha or phir iske baad is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpi gai thi
 The CBI had registered an offense in this case against Ajit Jogi, Amit Jogi, former MP PR Khutte, against Khut's son Omprakash Khunt
 lambii jaanch prakriya ke baadasibiaine march 2012 or phir janvari 2017 ko court main closer report saunp di thi or aropiyon ko doshamukt kar diya tha
 Virendra Pandey has challenged this closure report through advocate Satish Chandra Verma
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki closer report main shadyantr to mana gaya he lekin aropiyon ko clin chit de di gai he
 Pandey has said in the petition that if a conspiracy has taken place, we all are its partners
 unhone kaha ki tatkaaleen up pradhanmantri ne maamle kaa khulaasa karne ke liqurun jetlico raipur bheja tha or is puri prakriya main unke saath rajnath singh, sanjay joshi or dow
 Raman Singh was also there

 Due to default in payment, BCCI gave notice to the banks to seize the guarantee
 bainkon kii ore se varisht vakil janak dwarkadas ne adaalat se kaha ki is samay ve guarantee jabt karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Justice Wazifdar said, "if the banks have said that they are not bound to execute the notice given to them by the BCCI to seize the guarantee, then the court does not need to hear Nimbus's petition at present
" bank guarantee jabt karne kaa faisla lete hai to unhen nimbus ko teen din kaa notice dena hoga
 Nimbus, the owner of Neo Sports and Neo Cricket Channel, had filed a petition against the bcci's decision to cancel the broadcasting agreement
 nimbus ke vakil ikbaal chagala ne kaha, ham maanate hai ki nimbus ne samay par bhugtan nahin kiya lekin hamane bhugtan ke liye samay maanga tha

 " Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao are not just the most experimental filmmaker duo in India, but also the most admirable pair in the film world as a husband and wife
 donon hi latakon-jhatkon se koson dur jameen se jude swabhaav vaale dampati hai
 But exactly the opposite of each other in terms of choice of films
 aamir kii filmein jahaan box offis par dhamal machaati hai, vahiin kiran raav kalatmak pahalu par zyada dhyaan detii hai
 This kind of tussle between the two is very interesting in Bollywood
 aamir chaahate hai ki kiran romantic rishton vaali film main kaam karen to kiran kam charchit filmon ko logon kii najar main laana chaahati hai
 Both spoke openly to senior editor Gayatri Jayaraman on everything from their son Azad to the need of socio-political minded filmmakers
 dhobi ghat or taare jameen par filmon ke saath aap donon ek-ek film ke diarector ban chuke hai
 Who is the better filmmaker among you both? Kiran Rao: Amir
 ve is kala main zyada maahir hai
 Compared to me, they have been successful to a great extent
 meri film meri najar main kaaphi prayogtmak thi
 Now i see how i could have made it in a different way
 aamir khananjab maine taare jameen par banaai to mere paas filmon main kaam karne kaa kareeb 20 saal kaa anubhav tha, jabaki dhobi ghat kiran kii pehali film thi
 i don't think i could have made a film like Dhobi Ghat in the first place
 is tarah dekha jaae to kiran ne mere mukaable kahin zyada acchhee shuruyaat kii he
 The good thing with him is that he is also a writer himself, which i am not
 jab ve paatro kaa charitra chithran karti hai, to main garv se bhar jaataa hum
 Did you change your opinion about Aamir by directing him? Kiran: It is a privilege to accompany a competent artist like him while directing for the first time
 maine aise kalakaaron ko bhi chunaa tha jo yaa to puri tarah nae the, yaa gaiyr-profeshnal the
 It was a pleasure working with Aamir
 ve apni bhoomika main gaharaai tak dub jate hai or uske puraa hone tak role se baahar nahin aate
 Jh When you first started as a filming team, did you have a lot more pressure and expectations than today? Aamir: i am not impressed by the pressure at all
 mujhe nahin pataa ki logon ko mujhase kya ummiden hai
 This does not affect my work at all
 kiranhyah dabaav nahin, balki ek romaanchak dhukdhuki jaisi hoti he
 Aamir you get crores of rupees
 kii kamai vaali filmein banaate hai
 Kiran, you make artistic films
 kya filmein banane ke maamle main aap donon main kisi tarah kaa takaraav hota he?aamiralmeri pasand main vividhta hoti he
 Kiran: My choice is not multicolored
 aamiralekin saath kaam karte vakt hamaare bich kisi tarah kaa matbhed nahin hua
 i follow the script, you work the way you need to
 aamir, sabhi jaanate hai ki aap award kii upeksha karte hai
 Kiran, you have said that the film gets some benefit from the award
 kya is baat ko lekar aap donon ke vichaaron main takaraav hota he?kiraniumain nishchit taur par maanati hum ki jab koi film sarvshereshth videshi bhashaa kaa auskar yaa golden bear (berlin film festival) award jitati he to us film ko phayda hota he
 Aamir: i give very little importance to awards in my life
 aap ek film ko duusare se behatar ke rup main kaise chun sakate hai? main nahin samajhataa ki kalatmak kaamon kaa is tarah se akalan kiya ja saktaa he
 i agree with Kiran that with a few awards your market grows
 par award is baat kaa saboot nahin he ki meri film behatar he
 100 crores nowadays
 kii kamai karne vaali filmon ke daur main aap yah kaise faisla karte hai ki koi film acchhee he yaa nahin?aamirobijness ke hisaab se dekhen to main pehle hafte kii kamai or phir uske baad ke hafton kii kamai ko dekhtaa hum
 For example, 3 Idiots earned Rs 40 crore in the first week
 kii kamai kii
 In India, it collected a total of 202 crores
 kaa kaarobaar kiya
 40 crore in this way
 prati hafte ke hisaab se paanch hafton kii kamai 200 karod ru
 it occurs
 duusare shabdon main kahen to is film ne pehle hafte ke kaarobaar kaa paanch guna kaarobaar kiya
 This is a good sign that people have liked the film
 lekin 3 idiyats ne agar pehle hafte main 100 karod ru
 Would have earned Rs
 200 crores after that and his total business was Rs
 kaa hota to mere liye iskaa matlab hota ki logon ne film ko nakaar diya he
 i am saying this about mainstream films
 kiran, aap jis tarah kii filmein bananaa chaahati hai, vah kaarobaar kaise karti hai?kiranthamujhe ship of thesius bahut acchhee lagi or maine use bharat bhar main vitarit karne main madad kii
 We started it with 20 theaters in five cities
 baad main yah badhkar 80 cinemagharon tak pahunch gai
 In our campaign we asked people to vote for the release of this film in their city
 soshal media or duusari jagahon par isaki joardaar pratikriya mili
 This is the real love for a film
 aamirathham aaj ek aise jamaane main rah rahe hai, jahaan chijen kharidi ja sakati hai
 Even if a film has not been successful, i can convince you and the public that no, it has been successful
 aapane ek-duusare ke rahan-sahan or soch ko kitna prabhavit kiya he?kiranwamir ne meri kuch pehle se banaai gai dharanaon ko todgaye main madad kii he or duniya ko saamaanya nazariye se dekhne ke liye prerit kiya he
 Aamir: i understand that Kiran has helped to make me comfortable and taught me to be happier than before
 film industry main aap donon ko jameen se judi jindagi jeene ke liye janaa jaataa he
 How much does this normal life mean to you? Kiran: i feel that my status has grown very much by being married to a great personality
 iske baavjood mujhe lagata he ki meri jindagi kaa mul pahalu zyada nahin badla he
 Our life is quite normal, given the snappy life we could live
 main aaraam se baahar aa-ja sakati hum or kiraane kii kharidari khud kar sakati hum
 Aamir: We are living comfortably given our conditions
 kya maa-baap ke taur par saamaanya jivan kii zyada jarurat he?kiraniumain aaazaad ko press se dur rakhane kii koshish karti hum
 He does not know who Aamir is
 ve to bas papa hai
 He has not seen any of Papa's films
 vah kai baar film ke set par gaya he or uske hisaab se ve sab normal hai
 He would have to think that all the dads would be shooting
 aamiramujhe junayd or ira ke bare main yaad he
 Reena and i were always conscious that children should not grow up with some kind of badge on their shoulders
 main samajhataa hum ki usamen ham safal rahe hai
 Kiran: i want to do the same with Azad
 kiran, kya maa hone se filmein banane ke tareeke main kuch badlaav aayaa he?kiraniumain jis tarah kii filmein bananaa chaahati hum, unamem jivan kaa ek arth hota he
 Being a mother to some extent makes you feel like walking in the same direction
 satyamev jayate jaise sho dekhakar lagata he ki desh kii dasha ke prati aapke man main kahin chintaa he
 How important is the socio-political outlook as a filmmaker? Aamir: i definitely find socio-political issues troubling
 pichley teen saal se, jab se maine satyamev jayate ke liye research karnaa shuru kiya tab se aisa mahasoos karne laga hum
 It probably does not appear in my films, because i do not write their story
 lekin satyamev jayate banane kaa vichaar meraa hi tha
 Political films are not written much in our country
 aisa nahin ki maine aisi koi film nahin kii he
 Sarfarosh was largely a political film
 kiranapipli (live) bhi aisi hi film thi
 Aamir: Rang De Basanti can also be called a political film
 main is tarah kii teen filmein kar chukaa hum
 Three is not less, man
 kirantaham siyaasi film banane ke liye uske peeche bhaagate nahin hai
 Why Aamir: Siyasi, do not run after any kind of film
 is tarah se kuch bhi nahin hota ki acha, ab main ek siyaasi film banane ja rahaa hum yaa ki bacchon kii dekhbhaal par yaa phir shiksha par
 This is not my way of working
 main swaabhaavik tarah se chizon ko hone dena chahta hum
 If i like a story, i work on it
 satyamev jayate ke duusare charan main aap uski disha badal rahe hai yaa kisi nae nazariye par soch rahe hai?aamiraghhamane nae or ahm mudde liye hai
 We want to make it more sharp
 is baar ham samasyaon kaa samaadhaan bhi bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Do you feel any kind of responsibility towards young filmmakers and new films? Aamir: i was lost in my own work earlier
 lekin pichley kuchhek varshon main is bare main sochane laga hum
 That is why we used Peepli (live) and Jaane Tu
 
 Or did not know hamane sochaa ki hamen kahanikaron, nirdeshkon or kahaniyon kaa chunaav karnaa chahie or nai pratibhaaon ko mauka dena chahie
 We have done every film with a new director except for Kiranahlagan
 aamiramain is bare main or bhi kai baaten soch rahaa hum, jin par main kiran se charchaa bhi karata hum
 It is possible that i have two interns — a boy and a girl — for each of my films
 isse hamen nai soch kaa phayda milegaa or duusari taraf main apane anubhavon kaa laabh unhen bhi de sakuunga
 What do filmmakers think about next? Kiran: The extension has no special meaning for me
 main chaahuungi ki choti yaa badi or filmein banaaun
 Also help others make films
 aamiromere vichaar se bada hone kaa matlab behatar hona nahin he
 i want to go deeper into what i am doing
 main apane kaam ko or bhi zyada majaa lekar karnaa chahta hum or pehle se behatar filmein karnaa chahta hum
 i know that some people can do many things
 aadi (aditya chopra) saal main kareeb 12 filmein produs karte hai
 This is a big deal
 main aisa nahin kar saktaa
 i have a very strong emotional relationship with my audience
 main 25 varshon se abhinay kar rahaa hum
 i am so attached to the land of India that i want to stay here when my film is released
 main haul main jaakar dekhnaa chahta hum ki kya ho rahaa he
 i want to enjoy watching my film with the audience and watch them enjoy the film
 dha‘‘kyo?’’ mere saath acting main dar lagata he aapako? ’’mukhya bhoomikaaon main saath aane paramirankiran bahut hi umdaa kalakaar hai
 There was a roll at Dhobi Ghat, which i wanted them to do

 But she kept saying that i want to concentrate on my work as a director
 main to bhanna gaya tha
 i would absolutely like to work together
 kiranwanhin, mujhe nahin lagata ki main film main kaam karnaa chaahati hum
 Yes, you can walk in the theater
 
 
 aamiromere saath acting karne se darati ho?kiranhbahut hi zyada
 Oh God! Aamir: i am trying to say yes in some way
 kiranhor main is jhaanse main nahin aane vaali
 Aamir: Actually, there is a story about relationship
 lekin abhi yah soot na kapaas vaali sthiti he, isliye ise lekar ekaek yah mat bunane lagiega ki ‘‘lijie, aamir khan or kiran ek film main saath aa rahe hai
 "no offer came from Hollywood? Aamir: Leave Hollywood, i will be happy if i get an offer from any corner of the world

 Just be in the tongue that i know

 The country can wait for a uniform civil code, but the minimum legal age for marriage should be the same for women and men
 yah suzavvidhi ayogne diya he
 The commission said, 'the minimum legal age of marriage for women and men should be the same
 vayaskon ke bich shaadi kii alag-alag umr kii vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 'actually, under various laws, the legal age of marriage for women and men for marriage is 18 years and 21 years respectively

 'age of majority (18 years) should be recognized as the legal age of marriage for both men and women under the Indian Adult Act 1875
 patr main kaha gaya, 'pati or patni ke liye umr main antar kaa koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin he kyonki shaadi kar rahe donon log har tarah se baraabar hai or unki saajhedaari baraabar waalon ke bich vaali honi chahie
 The Commission shared the view that the difference in the marriage age of women and men contributes to the fact that wives should be younger than their husbands

 Winning team by run score: winner canada main mangalvaar ko ek fertility doctor kaa license radd kar diya gaya, kyonki vah pichley kai dashak se apane marizon ko inseminete (inseminate) karne ke liye khud ke shukranuon (sperm) sahit galat shukranuon kaa istemaal karata aa rahaa tha
 The College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Ontario Discipline Panel has also imposed a fine of 10,000 Canadian dollars on Bernard Norman Barwin's behavior as "horrific" and "malicious"
 medical niamak ne apane faisle main kaha, "aapane (apane marizon se) vishwasghaat kiya or apane krityon se vyaktiyon va unke pariwaron par bahut gaharaa asar daalaa he, or aisi apurnty kshati pahunchaai he, jo kai pidiyon tak bani rahegi
 
 
 "80-year-old doctor Bernard Norman Barwin himself did not appear during the hearing, but through his attorneys told not to contest the case
 barnard norman barvin apana medical license varsh 2014 main hi chhod chukaa he, jab use kritrim rup se teen mahilaon ko galat shukranuon se inseminete karne ke ek puraane cese main chetaya gaya tha
 At that time, the doctor described it as a common mistake
 ab uskaa license radd kiye jane se anya medical niamakon ko satark kiya jayega, taaki vah kisi anya ilaake main medical practice nahin kar sake
 Another case is going on against Barwin, who is alleged to have given 50-100 deliveries through the wrong sperm, in 11 of which he used his own sperm
 uski galat harakatein tab saamne ain, jab insemination se paidaa hue ek bachche ko apni paariwarik prishthbhumi jaanane kii utsukata jaagi, or ek anya ko celia rog se peedit paaya gaya, jo sirf anuvanshik hoti he, tathaa uske mata-pita main se kisi ko bhi vah rog nahin tha
 Rebecca Dixon said she found out three years ago at the age of 25 that Bernard Norman Barwin was her biological father
 uskaa kahana tha ki yah sunakar use khud se 'ghrinaa' ho gai, or use aisa mahasoos hone laga, jaise usamen 'zehar' ghol diya gaya ho
 During the statement as a victim, Rebecca said, "just, my life completely changed at that moment
 
 
 kuch samay ke liye to mujhe apana cheharaa bhi anjaana lagane laga, jaise aaine se jhaankta cheharaa puri tarah meraa nahin he

 i completed my graduation in Economics from St Stephen's College, Delhi, between 1973 and 1976
 maine tay kar rakhaa tha ki prashasnic seva kii pariksha main baithunga
 But in those days, it was difficult to score good marks in the examination of administrative services with economics as the main subject
 dilli uniwarsity ke arthshaastra main achche ank paane vaale ladakon ko prashasnic seva kii parikshaon main kam number mili the
 So, i decided that instead of economics, i would make International Relations the main topic
 maine jeenyu main aavedan kiya or mujhe skool of international relations (esaiar) main daakhila mil gaya
 i spent two years there
 ve do saal mere jivan ke bade anuthe varsh rahe
 During that time, i learned a lot about the world
 vahaan meraa vikaas saint stephens main bitaye teen saal ke mukaable kahin zyada hua
 The JNU experience was thrilling
 vah immergency ke baad kaa daur tha
 There used to be huge rhetoric and varied arguments about politics on campus
 jeenyu se kai chaatr giraftaar bhi hue the
 The campus used to be very vibrant and full of energy
 vahaan vampanthi vichaardhaara, ati vampanthi or charam vampanthi vichaardhaara vaale chaatr the
 There were a lot of debates and discussions in the hostel, which started after dinner and continued till morning
 mujhe yaad he ki maine kai aisi bahason main hissaa liya tha or bahut kuch siikhaa tha
 Many good speakers of different ideologies used to come to the university
 campus main swatantra vichaarkon ke kai sakriy samooh bhi the jo puri tarah se jaagruk to the lekin vam vichaardhaara ke prati rajnatik rup se patibaddh nahin hua karte the
 i was in the group of those independent thinkers
 esephai kii parisar main jaden bahut gahari thim
 i remember Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury and Jayaras Banerjee used to come during elections and there was a high level of intellectual discussion
 vichaardhaara ke mudde, vaishvik or rashtriya raajnneeti in bahason ke centre main rahati thi
 That is why the learning experience at JNU was very wide and diverse
 vishvavidhyalay ke bheetar, academik sarkal kaaphi jeevant tha
 Some teachers were extraordinary
 international studies skool main pratishthit shikshakon main ek professor ashok guha hote the jinhone mujhe arthshaastra padhaayaa
 There were also teachers like Professor Anand who taught international law
 professor es
 D
 muni or dow
 Pushpesh Pant was also there
 utkrisht shikshakon kaa ek puraa guladasta maujuud tha jinhone chaatro ko seekhney or vikaas main madad kii
 The quality of studies was very high
 jeenyu tab puraane parisar main tha
 After classes, we used to go to the library
 librari kii bagal main, ek dhaba tha jahaan ham bahes or charchaaon main kaaphi samay bitaate the
 i used to live in Periyar Hostel
 vahaan ke bauddhik maahaul se koi achoota nahin rah saktaa tha
 My sensitivity towards art, culture, dance and music developed at JNU itself
 jeenyu, kai myanon main, ek chota bharat hi tha
 There were students from every part of the country
 tab parisar bahut chota hua karata tha
 The campus is not as big as it was today as various departments and schools
 ek skool ke chaatr duusare skool ke chaatro ke saath baatcheet kiya karte the
 Meetings were held either at the dhaba or in the library
 yah aisa kuch hua karata tha jo mujhe ab nahin najar aata, kyonki vibhinn centre ek-duusare se dur-dur ho gaye hai
 Interaction between students of different schools is also very less now
 jaise hi eme kii padhai puri hui main prashasnic seva kii pariksha main baitha or safal rahaa
 i left JNU after spending two glorious years
 agar mujhe apane samay ke jeenyu ko sankshep main bataanaa ho, to kuch chijen jo main kahana chaahunga ve hai—vahaan kii shandaar faikalti, chaatro ko puri aazaadee or jeevant tathaa bauddhik vaataavaran se bharpoor campus
 The feeling of equality in JNU was of a very high level as the students here came from different surroundings and backgrounds
 kurta-jeens samskruti, jo yahaan ke chaatr hameshaa pahana karte the, sabhi ko ek aam str par lekar aati thi or is tarah se ek duusare kii saamaajik or aarthik prishthbhumi ke liye paraspar sammaan or saraahna kaa bhav bana rahata tha
 i made friends with different backgrounds here, who remain my friends till date
 vah aisa daur bhi tha jab jeenyu ke dheron chaatro ne desh ko badalane or kamjor tabake ke liye kuch karne kii patibaddhta ke saath sarkari sevaaon kaa chayan kiya
 In fact, the multidisciplinary approach students received at JNU helped them succeed in administrative services
 yahi jeenyu ko anya sansthaanon par bees banaata he
 a friend living on the same floor in my hostel — Asif Ibrahim became the director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB)

 Many of my classmates entered IAS and IFS and contributed significantly to India's development
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman bhi vishvavidhyalay kii ek pratishthit purv chaatra hai
 In my time, JNU Vice Chancellors worked with faculty and student solidarity
 aksar ham kuch rashtriya yaa antarrashtriya muddon par chaatro or faikalti sadasyon ko ek saath virodh pradarshan karte dekh sakate the
 Students were regularly arrested
 unamem se kai chaatro ko to niyamit rup se tughlaq road police stesan le jaaya jaataa tha lekin vishvavidhyalay prashasan or shikshakon ne hameshaa chaatro kaa samarthan kiya
 There was nothing like political discrimination or retaliation
 visi or faikalti milakar vishvavidhyalay ko chalaate the
 It was a symbol of autonomy
 mujhe lagata he ki mere samay main jo ekajutata dikhti thi, vah ab nadaarad he
 Often, students are on one side, management on the other side, while teachers retain a completely different attitude
 in teen ghatakon ko ek saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 They should have a common view of where they desire to take JNU in future
 jeenyu main chaatro kii chayan pranali main sudhaar hona chahie
 The selection system has become obsolete over time
 chayan yogyata aadhaarit hona chahie
 JNU should start its courses from the post graduate level itself
 keval skool of language main snaatak paathyakramon kii anumati di ja sakati he
 There is a need for radical changes in the selection process
 chaahe jo ho, vishvavidhyalay ko sarvshereshth chaatr paidaa karne hi honge
 They should be the best example of the Indian education system
 iske liye jaruri he yahaan achche chaatro ko avasar mili
 JNU students should try to excel in every sphere of life
 jeenyu ko shiksha ke utkrisht centre ke rup main dizin kiya gaya tha
 The focus should be on high quality research
 vishay kendrit shodh or jeenyu se adhik se adhik prakashnon kii aavashyaktaa he
 At present very little research is being done
 prakashit shodhpatron kii sankhya kam ho gai he
 JNU cannot remain such an isolated institution that remains lost in its world of ideology
 prashasan ko yah aashwast karnaa chahie ki vishvavidhyalay main vibhinn vichaardhaaraon kaa sah-astitv bana rahe
 JNU should collaborate and liaise with top universities like Stanford, Harvard, MIT and Oxford, the best universities in the world
 ek vakt vah bhi tha jab biechayu shaayad desh kaa sabase badhibia vishvavidhyalay hua karata tha
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed VC of the university only on the basis of his merit
 aage chalakar ve raashtrapati bhi bane
 Such was the University of Allahabad, in which many excellent teachers from South India taught
 shikshakon kaa chayan pratibha par aadhaarit tha
 From the mid-seventies on the merits caste, religion and regionalism dominated
 rajnatik hastkshep baduya shuru ho gaya
 As a result, many universities lost their reputation and legacy
 yogyata ko variyata dene kaa niyam waapas laayaa janaa chahie
 If JNU is to retain its legacy, it should improve the quality of teachers and students
 ant main, jeenyu main bahuaiami rujhaan lautnaa chahie
 There should not be only politics
 kala, samskruti, sangeet or khelon ko bhi bharpoor badhaava die janaa chahie
 Many schools in JNU have the potential to emerge as the best institutions of higher education in the world, sincere efforts should start in this direction
 lekhak jeenyu ke purv chaatr or philhal niti ayog ke siio hai

 According to a university release, from 1980 onwards, scientists knew that due to high snowfall in the Himalayas, the summer monsoon rainfall in India is less
 haalanki aisa kyon hota he, is sawaal kaa jawaab vaigyanikon ke paas bhi nahin tha
 New research published this week in Climate Dynamics studies processes based on the Meteorological Department or the Headley Center weather model
 yah pradarshit karata he ki adhik barfbaari se surya kii roshni kaa adhik paravartan hota he or iske kaaran himalay par thand hoti he

 Dr
 Andy Turner, the lead author of this research, said, 'our study has demonstrated that in the absence of effects from the tropical Pacific, snowfall conditions in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, India, especially in northern India, starts in the month of June
 Post-seasonal monsoon rains can be predicted

 Police sub-inspector Akhtar Ali has died during an encounter between miscreants and police in Dadri, Greater Noida
 police ne is maamle main aurangzeb naam ke ek aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The police team had gone to pressurize the accused Furkan in the new population here, where firing was done on them

 After the terrorist attack on the Pathankot air base, the Air Force took several steps in which the security of the air base could be made impregnable
 vayusena ne pehali baar apane air varirs ke liye khaas kuarti yani kuk riection training skool shuru kiya he
 Its name is One Security Training School which aims to create the first line of defense for the safety of every air base
 isi kadi main vayusena apane airman or officer ko khaas training de rahi he
 So that any terrorist attack can be thwarted in the coming days
 vayusena ke airman or officer ke liye regular training ke alaava ye khaas kuarti training he
 Read on Aaj Tak how Air Warriors who end the terror in Air Force's special One Security Training School, Bathinda, are being formed
 chaar hafte kii is khaas training main aadhunik hathiyaaron ke saath hi kadi shaareerik training di jaati hai
 In training, Airmen and Officers of Air Force are trained together, the training is very strict
 training ke dauraan inhen kai padaavon se guzarana hota he
 In this, the soldiers are taught the technique to ambush and kill in the air, in the water and in the forest
 aadhunik hathiyaaron se las ye air varirs raat ke andhere main bhi dushman ko pahchaan kar unka khaatmaa karne main trend hote hai
 At the time of the Pathankot terror attack, the terrorists entered the forest taking advantage of the forest and weed around the air base
 training main is tarah ke hamale ko naakaam karne kii khaas training di jaati he
 Mecca drills have taken advantage of some suspected forest and weed and entered inside the air base
 aise main sabase pehla morcha kuk riection team ne sambhaal liya
 As soon as the car landed quickly, QRT took over their respective positions
 achaanak firing shuru hote hi hamanen bhi apni suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bullate pruf jacket or helmet pahan liya
 The terrorists started attacking and firing from the Grenades
 kuarti team ne bhi javaabi firing shuru kar di
 The soldiers of the QRT team quickly start chasing the suspected terrorists
 jangal kaa phayda uthaakar aatanki air base ke andar ek building main ghusane main kaamyaab ho jate hai
 The Air Force is preparing its jawans to fight such a difficult and shocking condition
 kuarti team kaa puraa focus is baat he ki kisi bhi haalat main sandigdh air base main apane mansoobon main kaamyaab na ho paaen
 In every similar situation, the weapon of the young man is his weapon
 ek goli ek dushman ke mantra ke saath jawan apane lakshya par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Surefire targets are very important in close combat, that's why every soldier here is aiming hard
 achook nishaanaa lagane ke liye firing kaa ye silsilaa kai round chalata he
 According to Group Commander S
 Pasricha, Station Commander of Bhatinda Air Base, all the emphasis is given on how the enemy does not get a chance on every occasion
 aapako bataa den ki is training kaa ek khaas hissaa hota he, camoflaj and concilment class yani asapas ke ilaake ke hisaab se khud ko chupaana
 During this operation, the soldiers wear some special dress and hide in the surrounding grass
 camoflaj and concilment oparation ke dauraan jab kuch javaanon ko is mishan main lagaaya to ve chupe javaanon ko nahin dhund paae or achaanak ghasphoos main chupe javaanon ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 In fact, most of the Air Force bases are spread over remote and large areas
 aise main inaki suraksha ek badi chunauti hoti he
 The security of the air base, airstrip spread over a large area and the strategically important airplanes that accompany it is a major challenge
 aise main maatr kuch suraksha karmiyon se air base kii puri suraksha ko chaak chauband karnaa aasaan nahin he
 That is why every airman is being made part of the QRT, that is, every airman can become a commando and fight the terrorists
 javaanon kii treningjavaanon kii trening aage bahut hi mushkil hoti ja rahi he
 Chasing the enemy through landmines and trenches in the forest area
 is oparation ke dauraan jawan bady pier yani jodi banaakar aage bad rahe hai
 The danger is increasing step by step
 sabhi jawan saavdhaanee se aage bad rahe hai
 Caution is to carry out this mission on the lines of accident occurred
 contile taron ke neeche se bina aawaaj rengkar nikalnaa he
 There are more difficulties ahead, saving your weapon in the pond of water and moving forward
 is kadi trening ke peeche makasad he ki jawan aag, pani golabari har tarah ke halaat main apane ko dhaal len
 One STS Chief Instructor Wing Commander Manpreet Singh said that the soldiers managed to complete their mission by crossing landmines, ponds and trenches
 raat main hone vaale aatanki hamale se mukaable kii treninpub ham aapako bataate hai kii raat ke vakt agar aatanki ghuspaith kii koshish karen to usase kaise nipatanna he
 Terrorist attacks in recent times from Pathankot to Uri have taken place only by taking advantage of the darkness of the night
 aise main vayusena ke in javaanon ko nite petroling kii khaas training di ja rahi he
 During the night patrolling also has to be proceeded with caution
 tabhi achaanak firing kii aawaaj se sabhi jawan apni pojishan sambhaal lete hai
 In this QRT training of the Air Force, it is special that women officers are performing their responsibilities shoulder to shoulder with their male colleagues
 kuarti training kii tamaam mushkilaat se mahila adhikari bhi do chaar ho rahi hai
 Instructor Skadron Leader Mihir Mehta said that in this special training to deal with the growing threat of terror, women and male officers and jawans are simultaneously facing every kind of physical and mental challenge
 pathankot aatanki hamale ke baad pehali baar vayusena ke bhatinda air base main shuru hue van sicurity training skool main ab tak paanch batch paas ho chuke hai
 Air warriors who have taken special training of QRT from here have taken a stand at different air bases of the country
 airforce aane vaale dinon main aise or khaas sicurity training skool kholegaa jisase desh main har air base main aatank se mukaable ke liye pehali majboot raksha diwaar taiyaar kii ja sake
 Hello, Ravish Kumar, in politics, against whom you make your existence, you have to join hands to save that existence
 ye hua he or ye hota he
 Its encouragement comes from the fact that if the public has accepted a wonder at one time, then it has also been rejected
 jab raajnneeti kaa matlab chunaav jeetna hi ho jaae to haarane vaala bhi vahi karata he jo jeetne vaala kar jaataa he
 If you are feeling uncomfortable with Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav coming to Bihar, then you are no exception
 aap jaanate hai ki bihar main 21 agast ko das siton ke liye upachunaav hone hai
 Narkatiaganj, Rajnagar, Jale, Chapra, Hajipur, Mohiuddin Nagar, Parbata, Bhagalpur, Banka and Mohania
 vidhansabha kii in das siton ke liye argedy or jediu ke bich samjhauta hua he
 In less than a month, it will be known that Mandal has fed some gul and is left feeding kamandal
 yah sahi he ki loksabhaa main narendra modi se sab lard to rahe the, magar milakar koi nahin lard rahaa tha
 To provide relief to the losers, it was supplied like a data tablet that the BJP got only 31 percent votes across the country, while 69 percent of the votes were against
 2009 main upie ko bhi to 31
 5 percent votes were received
 phir bhi kya is 69 pratishat main se koi nayaa purana votbank milakar modi ko chunauti di ja sakati he
 In Bihar, the Modi coalition received 39 percent votes
 congress, argedy or jediu ko mili voton ko jod den to kareeb 45 pratishat ho jaataa he
 a similar multiplication was done on paper before the election, in which Modi was not getting a majority despite the lead
 phir se vahi farra bihar main aasteen se nikaala ja rahaa he
 For a minute, let us assume that despite the Modi wave, these three parties of Bihar got more votes than the BJP
 45 pratishat vot
 Then there is the question that despite all the contradictions, the backward-most backward, dalit-mahadalit went with the BJP
 nahin jaataa to bijepi ko 40 main se 31 siten kaise mil jaatin
 Kamandal stopped Mandal in the 90s
 par 2014 main bijepi ne usee kamandal main mandal daal diya
 Backward poor chaiwala Hindutva and development
 modi ne aisa cocktail banaaya ki lohiavaadiyon kaa mocktel fail ho gaya
 Even in the organization and publicity capacity, anti-modi parties still seem to be lax and extinct
 kul milakar pichhadon or daliton ne bhi modi ko apana netaa mana
 Every caste society should vote for Modi
 upi main to modi ne apane vot bank ko jeb main lekar chalane vaali mayawati ko shunya par samet diya
 Is it not so that even today Lohibabadi, Ambedkarites remain trapped in the same cage of their politics and the parrot flees
 kya tota waapas pinjre main aayega
 Any coalition has a political justification, then a moral and natural justification
 nitish kumaar ne itnaa bada risk liya hi kyon yaa phir unke paas kya chaara tha
 When the BJP can ally with Ram Vilas Paswan's party, which was Lalu's decade-old ally and Nitish is anti-bjp alliance, why can't Nitish go with Lalu
 par ham taraazoo par aalu nahin taul rahe
 If there is one less here, then there is one
 nitish bihar kii us janata ko kaise samajhaayenge jo unki itani si baat na samaj saki ki unhone narendra modi kaa saath isliye choda kyonki ve dharmanirpekshata ke sawaal par samjhauta nahin kar sakate the
 The people of Bihar also rejected Nitish's model of development
 gujarat ke andekhee magar sune hue model par zyada bharosa kiya
 It should be noted that the people of Bihar left Nitish in the Lok Sabha even when he was not with Lalu
 balki lalu unke kilaaf lade or chaturaai dikhaate hue congress ko nitish ke paas jane se roak diya
 Both Lalu and JDU had their eyes on Paswan, but the BJP took it away
 kya nitish ko vaaki ab apane vikaas ke model main yakeen nahin rahaa
 You will call it master stroke of Nitish or master medicine on killing stroke
 bachenge to isi se varna nahin
 Sonia Gandhi did the same in 2004
 majboot atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv ke saamne gathbandhanon kaa ambara laga diya tha
 Vajpayee lost
 tab bhi jab bijepi ko sonia ke videshi mul vaale mudde par bahut bharosa tha
 Is Nitish really in a position to repeat this formula in Bihar
 hamaari raajnneeti main aniatik or avishwasaneey se lagane vaale gathbandhan hue hai or hote rahenge
 We will choose the scale of our morality according to our convenience and will keep our heart with one alliance and keep another
 congress virodh ke lambey daur main kya samaajwaadiyon ne unheen kamandal waalon se haath nahin milaayaa tha
 Didn't these anti-congress socialists join hands with the Congress? kya mamata banerjee congress se nikal kar congress kii sarkaar kii sahyatri nahin bani
 Did not Sharad Pawar accept the leadership of the same Sonia Gandhi by raising the issue of foreign origin
 kise bharosa he ki kal sharad pavaar shivasena se gathbandhan nahin karenge
 Such news keeps on flying
 kya congress ke parivaarwaad se ladane nikali bijepi ne akali, shivasena or ramvilas paswan ke parivaarwaad ko andekha nahin kiya
 Did not ignore familism within his party
 koi guarantee nahin de saktaa ki bijepi chautaala kii party se samjhauta nahin karegi
 The Akali Dal campaigned for Chautala's party in the Lok Sabha, ignored by the BJP
 chautaala pita putr shikshak bhartee ghotaale main jail bheje gaye the
 Currently on bail
 yedurappa ko nikaalkar bijepi waapas le ai or kya janata ne vot nahin kiya
 Did Lalu, who ended the Congress in Bihar, not tie up with the Congress? udhaaharan to khub hai
 You can forgive even in politics with these examples
 sawaal he, ek samay vishesh main kisi gathbandhan kii vishwasaneeyata kaa
 Of motive
 nitish ke brand bihar main unheen kaa gadha hua, lalu kaa jangal raaj kaise mix hoga
 Prime time
 yun to bhagwaan shriram kii janmasthali ayodhya (ayodhya) hinduon kii aasthaa kaa centre he, lekin yahaan ke hanumangadhi (hanuman Garhi) sthit 'bajrangbali' najim naam ke ek muslim vyakti ke laae phulon se sajaae jate hai
 Not only this, a garland of flowers arranged in the hands of Nazim's wife Chunni adorns the neck of Lord Hanuman
 uttar pradesh (uttar Pradesh) ke gonda jile main gonda-ayodhya haive par vajirganj vikaas khand sthit jamaadaar purava based najim ali kaa parivaar phulon kii kheti karata he
 The flowers brought from his garden to Ayodhya are offered in Hanumangarhi
 yah baat alag he ki ramajnmabhumi (ramjanmbhoomi) duniyabar main hindu-muslim vivaad ke liye janaa jaataa rahaa he
 But in the temples of this place, the life-worshiped god is adorned with flowers grown by Muslim families
 hanuman gadhi sahit anya dev sthanon par inke ugaae phulon se hi puja-paath hoti chali aa rahi he
 Nazim explained, "we cultivate marigold and rose for 20-25 years
 hanumangadhi main pehle mere abba phool dete the
 Ever since i assumed my senses, i see that our own flowers are offered in other temples of Ayodhya including Hanumangarhi, Ramlala, Nageshwarnath
 " phulon kii kheti karne vaale najim ne kaha, "meri bivi ke haathon gunthi maala bhagwaan ke gale main daali jaati he
 My wife also has an equal participation in our work since marriage
 ham donon padhe-likhe nahin hai, lekin apane bacchon padhai kaa hamane puraa intjaam kiya he
 "he told that bundles of 50 buds of flowers, ready to be prepared in December, are sold in Gonda, Ayodhya, Lucknow
 yah phool desh ke anya sthanon- jaise dilli, mumbai, punjab or haryana tak le jaae jate hai
 Nazim said that he does not get any government help in cultivating flowers
 phool taiyaar karne ke baad kuch sthaneey str par bechate hai or zyaadaatar khapat ayodhya main hoti he
 Nazim says that if government grants are available, they can do farming on a large scale
 tab jindagi khushhaal ho jaati
 Whatever be the name of Ram Janmabhoomi, which has been booming over the years and the communal harmony has been deteriorating, we have been offering flowers of Muslim flowers to the idols of the Lord situated in the same Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi, it is such a pleasure

 The Indian stock market seems to be on a sustained upside, looking at the recent past
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki equity mutual pha fundon main pichley do varshon main record paisa aayaa he
 Many investors who are investing in mutual funds (mutual funds) for the first time or who are not aware of the stock market, are also confidently investing in mutual funds
 lekin isamen paisa lagane se pehle aapako thodi research jarur kar leni chahie kyonki is samay bazaar main bahut saare mutual fund hai
 There is also a need for discipline in investing, which, if not adhered to, can affect profits
 ekamusth niveshmutual fund main ekamusth rakam nivesh karnaa sahi nahin he kyonki bazaar kii chaal jokhim bhari bhi sabit ho sakati he
 It would be better to invest through the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
 esaypi ke jariye nivesh se kharid laagat ko ausat karne main madad milti he yani bazaar ke utaar-chadhaav ke bich ausat rup se phayda hi miltaa he
 If you have a lump sum, then it is prudent to invest in a debt fund and then start a systematic transfer plan in an equity fund
 taaja pradarshan ke aadhaar par fund kaa chunaav karanjab bazaar acha chal rahaa ho to zyaadaatar fund kaa pradarshan acha hi rahata he
 When the stock market declines, there is a greater need to be careful in fund selection, not all funds are able to stop the decline in their value
 lihaaja nivesh karte samay fund kaa deerghakalin pradarshan dekhnaa jaruri hota he
 It has to be seen how it performed in the ups and downs
 behtareen pradarshan karne vaale kisi bhi saajha kosh ke peeche aankh mundakar na bhaagen
 Investments in sectoral funds Thematic or sectoral funds (sector-specific funds) outperform the market when the market is on the upswing
 pichley ek saal main banking or infrastractor fund kaa pradarshan bahut acha rahaa he or unhone kramshah 32 or 25 pratishat kaa ritern diya he jabaki largecap diversyphid fundon ne 18 pratishat kaa laabh diya he
 But it is not advisable to invest a large part of your income in these funds because they can also prove to be risky — the performance of the fund depends on a single sector or theme
 agar us sector ke sheyaron main giravat aati he to sabase zyada chot inhen par padati he
 Apart from this, the right time to invest in and exit it should also be chosen for good returns
 hameshaa jokhim uthaane kii apni kshamta ke hisaab se nivesh karnaa chahie
 Dividend Option for long-term goalsif you are investing for long term then it is better that you adopt the option of growth option because by doing so your profits are reinvested and start to increase over time
 lekin dividend opshan main aisa nahin hota, jahaan aapke munaafe kaa ek hissaa net asset vailu (enevi) se vanchit kar diya jaataa he or vah aapako de diya jaataa he
 Choose the dividend option only when you need the money, otherwise it would be wise to choose the growth option
 iske alaava aapako niyamit aay ke taur par dividend opshan kaa chunaav nahin karnaa chahie kyonki kuch fundon kaa labhaansh dene kaa itihaas to acha hota he lekin isaki koi guarantee nahin hoti

 Google is celebrating the birth anniversary of world famous painter Jamini Rai through Doodle
 pashchim bengal main janmen is chitrakaar ne duniya bhar main bhartiya kala ko ek alag pahchaan dilaai
 Jamini Rai trained in the British style of painting became an eminent painter in the early decades of the 20th century
 kareeb 60 saal tak jaimin raay ne bharat sahit duniya bhar main hue badla ko drishy bhashaa se prastut kiya
 This is the reason why he is considered among the modernist great artists
 kala main unke isi yogadan ko dekhte hue 1955 main bharat sarkaar ne unhen padam bhushan sammaan se nawaja
 The comments jaimini raay kii chitrakaari main rashtravaadi andolan, sahitya or kala kii amit chhap dikhti he
 Jamini Rai is said to have been looking for new forms of art that touched his heart in the few years after 1920, except the art style he had learned during the period of education
 iske liye unhone vibhinn prakaar ke sroton jaise purv asian lekhan style, pakki mitti se bane mandiron kii kala vallariyon, lok kalaon kii vastuon or shilp paramparaon aadi se prerana lee
 Jamini Rai portraits continued to be used, along with his folk-style portrait artworks until the 1930s, in which his brush was effectively used
 aashcharya kii baat he ki unhone europe ke mahaan kalakaaron ke chitron ko bhi bahut sundar anukritiyaan banaain
 In the later years of 1920, Rai created paintings depicting rural scenes and people's happiness, reflecting the naive and free-spirited life of his childhood upbringing in a rural environment
 ve 1887 main vartmaan pashchim bengal ke bankura jile ke beliator gaanv main janme the, isliye yah ek prakaar se unke liye swaabhaavik prayaas tha
 There is no doubt that after this period he tried to express his proximity to his roots
 saal 1972 main is vishwa prasiddh chitrakaar kaa dehanth hua tha
 The painting of Jaimini Rai has an indelible impression of nationalist movement, literature and art
 bataaya jaataa he ki jaimini raay ne shiksha grahan kii avadhi jo kala style sikhi thi, use chhodkar 1920 ke baad ke kuch varshon main unhen kala ke aise naye roopon kii talash thi, jo unke dil ko choote the
 For this, he drew inspiration from a variety of sources such as the East Asian style of writing, the art of temples made of terracotta temples, valleys, folk art objects and craft traditions, etc
 1930 ke dashak tak apni lok style kii chitra kalakritiyon ke saath-saath jaimini raay portret bhi banaate rahe, jisamen unke brush kaa prabhavi dhang se istemaal najar aata tha
 Surprisingly, he also made very beautiful simulations of paintings of great artists of Europe
 1920 ke baad ke varshon main raay ne gramin drishyon or logon kii khushiyon ko prakat karne vaale chitra banaae, jinamein gramin vaataavaran main unke bachapan ke laalan-paalan ke bhole or svachhand jivan kii jhalak thi
 He was born in 1887 in Beliatore village in Bankura district in present-day West Bengal, so it was a natural attempt for him
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki is kaal ke baad unhone apni jadon se najdiki ko abhivyakti dene kii koshish kii
 This world famous painter died in the year 1972

 At the same time, the investigating agency also objected to the allegations that there is a lack of honesty in its investigation in this case
 sibiai kii ore se upasthit varisht vakil ke ke venugopal ne nyaayamurti ji es singhvi or e ke ganguli kii peeth ko bataaya, abhi tak kii jaanch main airsel kii bikri malaysia ke mexis samooh ko karne ke maamle main maaran dwaara jabaran dabaav daalane ke bare main koi pramaan nahin mila he
 "initial investigations have revealed the fact that the Malaysian company was in contact with the minister and his brother before the acquisition of c Sivasankaran's company," he said
 sibiai ne kaha ki media dwaara pichhali sunwaayee ke aadhaar par kii gai galat reporting kii vajah se aisa lagane laga he ki maaran ko is maamle main clin chit di gai he
 Venugopal said, "there was misreporting and misinterpretation of the status report presented on September 2
 jaanch agency ne enjio centre for public interest litigeshan ke is aarope par bhi naaraazgi jataai ki is maamle main jaanch main eemaandaaree kam he
 Venugopal was referring to the application filed by Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the NGO, that any investigation conducted by the investigating agency so far would not survive in the lower court
 unhone kaha, prashanth bhushan ne arji main sibiai ke khilaaf bayaan darj kiya he
 This is quite unfortunate
 hamen is bayaan par aapatti he, kyonki ham is nyaayalay ke aadesh par kaam kar rahe hai
 Maran was the Telecom Minister from May 2004 to May 2007
 unhen july main kapadaa mantri ke pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The CBI had said that it is investigating the report lodged against him by Sivasankaran
 shivashankaran ke paas 2006 main airsel kaa swaamitv tha
 The CBI said that during Maran's tenure there was a deliberate delay in giving letters of intent (lois) to the promoter of Aircel
 agency ne kaha he ki airsel ko mexis samooh ko beche jane ke baad malaysian company ne maaran parivaar ke kaarobaar main nivesh kiya tha
 The CBI had on July 6 accused Maran in the Supreme Court that he had pressurized Chennai telecom operator in 2006 to sell his stake to Maxis
 agency ne apni sthiti report main kaha ki maaran ne shivashankaran ko airsel main apni hissedari mexis samooh ko bechney ke liye dabaav daalaa tha
 Maran denied these allegations
 bijepi ram mandir ke mudde par buree tarah funs gai he
 Yogi Adityanath went to Ayodhya yesterday to restore the Ram temple issue to the center of politics
 lekin santon ke sawaalon ne unhen aise gheraa ki sangh ko sthiti se aagaah karne ke liye unhen dilli kii ore daudna padaa
 For the Ram temple, Yogi Adityanath advised to be patient and the saints bluntly said that it cannot wait any longer
 gorakhpur vaale mahant ji ko mahasoos hone laga he ki mandir par ayodhya vaale mahanton kaa dhairya chook rahaa he
 Anyway, for 32 years, we have been patient
 adwani ke rath se lekar modi ke raaj tak ram mandir ke naare main dhairya ke alaava he kya
 From 1998 to 2018, the residents of Madai started living in the palatial palaces waiting for Shri Ram's Ayodhya ascent
 rath se chalane vaale boing main udne lage, or hanumangadhi main aarti karne vaale haath jode khadey rahe ki jab lakhanu se dilli tak camel khile jayega to prabhu ram kaa vanvaas bhi khatm ho jayega
 But this wait was neither to be stopped nor felt
 ab bijepi par fida satta ke vyagr vanavaasi kehete hai ki hamen nahin maaloom court-kachhari ab to ayodhya main ram mandir chahie hi chahie
 That is, before 2019, the BJP has taken the Ram temple issue off the rope
 jab chaha dhoyaa, jab chaha sukhoya or jab chaha ho gaya
 Half of the people say that they will wait for the court's decision and half say that the court court is nothing but the Ram temple
 darasal bijepi ko lag rahaa he ki 2019 kii krupa ram mandir main hi ataki hui he, isliye mahant nritygopaldaas ke janmdin ke bahaane jab hanumangadhi main majamaa laga to mahant mukhyamantri ko bhi maathaa navanaa padaa
 The congregation of sadhus has lost control over this appeal of patience and the BJP is stuck
 yogi adityanath ayodhya main santon se mili to unki samaj main aa gaya ki ab wo or bahalane ko raji nahin hai
 So immediately he fled to Jhandewalan in Delhi
 aresas ko hisaab-kitaab dene, praveen togadiya ke ayodhya kooch ke elaan ne alag mushkil khadi kar di he
 Yogi Adityanath, who made Ayodhya the second capital of his politics, does not understand how to handle saints
 puri ayodhya main ek bhi sant unke saath sahanubhuti jataane vaala nahin mila
 In such a situation, Iqbal Ansari of the Waqf Board may have given him coolness by speaking for him

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not only working hard but also working with his ministers and subordinates

 This news has been given by an economic newspaper
 patr ke mutabik piem modi ne keval khud bahut zyada kaam karte hai balki apane sahyogiyon se bhi yahi ummid karte hai
 This has increased the agility of the government but winds have started blowing on the faces of ministers
 unke 44 mantriyon ke liye yah kathin he
 It is not even three weeks since the government has formed, that the ministers have started telling their friends that the PM is very strict in terms of getting work
 kai mantri to uninde se dikh rahe hai or kaam ke dabaav tathaa tanaav se kaiyon kii sehat kharaab hone lag gai he
 Work starts in the morning with PM Modi
 kuch mantri aise hai jinhen dopaher main jhapai lene kii aadat thi lekin vah sab ab khatm ho gaya he
 Now they have to stay awake till late night
 bijepi ke mantriyon kii samasya he ki pichley kai varshon tak ve satta se baahar the or unke kaam karne kii aadat khatm ho gai thi
 Now they are working day and night, whose effect is clearly visible
 patr ne lok shakti party ke sarvesarva ramvilas paswan kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he ki haal main jab kuch patrkaar unase milane gaye the to unki ankhen laal ho rahi thim, jab unase is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki dilli kii garmi se aisa hua he
 But one of his colleagues told that the minister used to start work from the afternoon but now he has to work with the PM, which is showing the effect
 ek or mantri hai jo dopaher kaa bhojan karne ke baad hi kaam shuru karte the lekin ab subah-subah kaam par lag jate hai
 He is now worried about his health
 yahi haal nitin gadakari kaa he
 He also used to start the routine from noon but now he gets up early in the morning
 piem modi kii pehali kol unhen hi jaati he
 Since the death of Gopinath Munde, he has doubled responsibility
 kai mantri aise hai jinke paas do-do mantralay hai or ve kaam ke boj ke tale dab gaye hai
 The letter quoted reliable sources as saying that the cabinet would expand before the budget session
 iskaa uddeshy kaam ke bhaar se dabe mantriyon kaa boj halkaa karnaa he

 mahilaon ne jaise hi jhaadu thama, sthaneey yuvakon ne virodh shuru kar diya
 The youth said that they do not have trouble with the cleaning campaign, but all this should not be done wearing a burqa
 yahi nahin, yuvakon ne aarope lagaaya ki burka odhe ye mahilaayein muslim nahin balki hindu samudaay se taalluk rakhti hai
 a woman involved in the cleanliness drive told that some youths from her community have misunderstood the campaign
 mahila ne kaha, 'logon ne hamase kaha ki agar ham ye sab kaam karti hai to ham muslim nahin balki hindu hai
 'she adds,' When the Prime Minister can lift the broom to keep the country clean, can't we also clean the locality
 'kaaji or shiya dharmaguru ne kii tarifburke par uthe vivaad par shahar ke kaaji ne kaha ki burka muslim mahilaon kaa pardaa he
 If she is engaged in cleaning campaign wearing a burqa, then there is nothing wrong in this according to the Shariah, but glad that she has started the campaign by staying in the curtain
 shiya dharmaguru kalbe javwaad ne bhi mahilaon ko sahi bataate hue muslim yuvakon ke bayaan kii ninda kii
 He said, 'it is also written in the hadith that cleanliness should be done around the neighborhood and the house

 vahiin gargi college ke baahar bam banane kaa saamaan milane se dehshat fail gai he
 Police also say that the wires were not connected and the circuit was not complete, so there was no risk of explosion
 police ko yah bhi ashanka he ki dehshat failaane ke liye bhi koi aisi vaardaat ko anjaam de saktaa he
 Earlier, on May 25, a bomb with a moderate intensity explosion occurred outside the High Court

 Justice Santosh Hegde, who walks shoulder to shoulder with Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal for Jan Lokpal, is happy to form the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi
 unhone sansad main paas lokapal bill ko kamjor bataaya lekin saath hi kaha ki agar ham majboot lokapal par ade rahete to ye bhi nahin miltaa
 This law can be further improved
 padhein santosh hegade se khaas baatcheet ke ansh
 Question: Do you think that Arvind Kejriwal has weakened the anti-corruption camp and civil society, because he first opposed the Congress and then is forming the government with his help? Hegde: i don't think it hurt It is because if Kejriwal had not formed a government, he would have lost the Lokshahi
 sab log kah rahe the ki usko gavarment nahin banani chahie
 But i think that in Lokshahi, one has to make a government
 agar duusari baar chunaav hote to uskaa sara boj janata par hi aata
 And without compromising their terms and their values, they form government with the help of anyone, there is no harm in that
 bharat main rajyon main sayukt sarkaar bananaa aam baat he
 Question: Had Anna Arvind supported Kejriwal, could it have won more seats? Hegde: If Anna Arvind had been openly supported, the Aam Aadmi Party could have got more seats than this
 prashn:jab arvind kejariwal ne sarkaar banane kaa nirnay liya or uske bare main anna se poocha gaya to unhone kaha no coment
 And when he was invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony, Anna said that my health is not good
 kya isse lagata he ki donon ke bich main daraar aa gai he?hegade:mujhe nahin lagata he ki aisa kuch he kyonki anna kii tabiyat lambe safar ke liye acchhee nahin he
 Anna is not well and invitations have also started getting
 mujhe bhi aaj hi nyotaa mila he
 i will reach Bangalore late tonight, so i cannot go there either
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki main arvind ko saport nahin karata hum
 i do not think there is any difference between Kejriwal and Anna
 prashn:abhi jo lokapal bill paas hua he uske bare main aap kya kahenge?hegade:mujhe nahin lagata he ki ye shashakt lokapal he
 The country was fighting for this law for the last 45 years and our last objective is also to bring a law
 ek baar kanoon aa jaae phir usamen sudhaar ho sakate hai
 If we had requested for a strong Lokpal, this would not have happened
 prashn:2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke bare main aap kya kahenge?hegade:aglaa chunaav bahut mahatv rakhata he
 The BJP has performed well in the last elections held, although it has lost the government in Karnataka
 ye abhi to kah nahin sakate ki kisko bahumat milegaa lekin jo bhi hoga wo intresting hoga
 Question: Can the emergence of 'AAP' give competition to both the main parties? Hegde: i have felt in the city
 log ek acchhee sarkaar chaahate hai par gaanv main log kya sochate hai
 i do not know
 dilli main to log parivartan chaahate the or wo laaye bhi
 The government is very focused on turning the dream of 'digital India' into reality
 khaas taur par jab se notebandi kaa elaan hua he, tab se bhugtan ke liye cash kii jagah digital tareeke apnaane par focus he
 Online transactions will increase with the move towards cashless economy and digital currency
 aise main sibar aarthik aparaadh badhane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin sibar aparaadhon se nipatane ke liye sarkaar kitni gambhir he, yah isi se pataa chalata he ki sibar apillet tribunel ke cheirperson kaa pad beete saadhe paanch saal se khaali padaa he
 If someone is a victim of cyber economic crime, first of all, he knocks at the door of the bank and the police
 police kaa sibar cell cese ko crack kar apradhi ko sajaa bhi dilava detaa he, lekin peedit ko aarthik nuksaan kii bharpai kaise ho? online cash ke tranjection kii sthiti main kisi tarah kii dhokhadhadi hui to philhal nyaay paanaa bahut tedi kheer he
 The situation is that Justice Rajesh Tandon, the last Chairperson in the Cyber appellate Tribunal set up for the hearing of cyber crime, retired on 30 June 2011
 us din ke baad se ye pad khaali padaa he
 The Government formed the Cyber appeal Tribunal in 2006
 2009 se ise bahusadasyeey kar diya gaya
 At present, the tribunal has two members - judicial members and technical members
 tribunel sanchaar or soochna praudyogiki mantralay ke adheen vaidhanik sanghathan he
 The CAG had expressed concern in the report submitted to Parliament in November by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) about the long appointment of the chairperson of the Cyber appellate Tribunal
 report ke mutabik is vajah se tribunel ke paas lambit pade maamalon kii sunwaayee nahin ho paa rahi he
 The CAG report said that the justification of the formation of a tribunal is becoming meaningless due to non-appointment of chairpersons and other members not having the right to set up benches and disposing of appeals
 CAG kii report main ye bhi kaha gaya ki april 2011 se march 2016 tak vetan, kiraye jaisi tribunel se judi madon main 27
 64 crore rupees have been spent
 sutron ke mutabik ye jo kharch hua usamen 80 fisadi hissaa to tribunel ke daftar kaa kiraaya dene main lag gaya, jo ki dilli ke conot place main he
 Cyber expert Pawan Duggal has asked the government for the early appointment of the chairperson in the tribunal, saying that without doing so, pending cases will neither be investigated nor will the dream of Digital India progress

 soshal media par to aise-aise daawey kiye gaye jo behad chaunkaane vaale to the hi saath main haasyaaspad bhi
 Even the local media made unconfirmed claims which spread hatred between the two countries
 pakistani website 'da nesan' ne daawa kiya ki airport par aatankiyon se jo hathiyaar baraamad hue hai, vah bharat nirmit hai
 Let us tell you that the terrorist organization tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for this attack and a spokesman of Pakistani Rangers has told that according to preliminary information, the attackers are from Uzbekistan

 Unknown people killed a reporter of Geo News Channel in the political violence in Karachi, Pakistan
 shahar main ho rahi hinsa main ab tak kam se kam aath log maare ja chuke hai
 This reporter named Wali Babar was returning home on Thursday night, when unknown people stopped him and shot him close
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, ‘ham is hatya ke kaarnon kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 It is too early to say anything
 ’haalanki jeeyo news channel is hatya ko nishaanaa bana kar kii gai hatya bataa rahaa he
 The violence has continued in the city since Tuesday night
 police ne is silsile main 12 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 Firing continued between two opposition political groups, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Awami National Party activists, on Friday
 kendriya mantri piyush goyal aaj modi sarkaar kaa aakhri or antarim bajet pesh karne vaale hai
 If you look at the last several budget speeches, you will find that there have been big changes in this and the focus of the speeches has shifted from growth and development to farmers and digital revolution
 modi sarkaar ke pichley 5 bajet bhaashanon kaa vishleshan karen to paaenge ki upie-2 or narendra modi kii endie sarkaar ne shabdon kii khub baazeegari kii he or isamen technology ne bhi ahm role nibhaayaa he
 UPA-2 vs
 NDA: Some words that were repeated repeatedly: In UPA-2 and NDA government budget speeches there were many words that were repeated and people focused on it again and again
 upie kaa bajet vikaas or nivesh kendrit tha to endie ke focus main isamen bada badlaav dekha gaya
 In 2015-16, the term investment was returned again and its resonance was heard in the budget of that year
 is saal ke pehle tak log vikaas or nivesh sunate- sunate in shabdon ke lagbhag aadi ho chale the, tabhi bajet bhaashan kaa pattern badla or kisaan centre bindu main aa gaye
 The second term most commonly used is rural development and village-farmers
 upie-2 ke dauraan kisaan shabd 47 baar sune gaye to endie ke bajet main 81 baar
 There was a double difference between the two governments
 ab baat 2017-18 bajet kii
 This was the post-demonetisation era
 is saal ke bajet main digital shabd sabase zyada prachlit rahaa
 After this, the words Vikas and Kisan came to be heard
 jabaki 2018-19 main puure bajet kaa kalevar badla dikhaa or sabhi shabdon par 'infrastracchar' baari pad gaya
 What is the concern of the poor? It is astonishing that in UPA-2 government which claims the poor, the poor words are heard very less, while the NDA took it very much
 upie-2 ke bajet bhaashan main garib shabd mahaj 5 baar sune gaye, to endie main 65 baar
 This was 13 times more than the UPA government
 ganga maiyaa ko sabase zyada kisne bhunaayashayad hi koi sarkaar ho jisane ganga kii pavitrataa or mailaapan kaa zikr na kiya ho, lekin isamen donon sarkarein lagbhag ek si raheen
