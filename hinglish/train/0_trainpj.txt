 Kapil said, 'it was the same wicket as Nottingham and see the difference between bowling there and here

 a picture is distracting
 dilli ke saket court ke baahar ek vakil pulicekarmi ko maar rahaa he
 Kills only
 police ke jawan kaa helmet le liya gaya he
 When the young man gets out of the bike, the lawyer gives his helmet on the bike
 jawan ke kandhe par martha he
 This is an insult to the soldiers of India, not only Delhi
 yah tasviir bataati he ki bharat main system nahin he
 Has collapsed
 yahaan bheed raaj karti he
 Home minister Amit Shah should stand in favor of this jawan
 vaise wo karenge nahin
 Must do so because being the Home Minister is the guardian of Delhi Police
 dilli police ke kamishnar patnayak ko saket court janaa chahie
 If the commissioner does not go, then the morale of the soldiers will be broken
 dilli police ke upayuktaon ko march karnaa chahie
 Would Delhi Police have kept quiet if any common man did? The Delhi Police has been attacked recently
 desh kii ek acchhee police dhire-dhire khatm ho rahi he
 Iqbal of Delhi Police will be over
 supreme court se lekar saket court tak ke jaj kyon chup hai? unki chuppi nyaay vyavastha se bharose ko khatm karti he
 It is shameful to beat a young man in this way
 adaalat ke saamne ghatana hui he
 The country has become a group of cowards
 jo bheed he vahi maalik he
 That is the law
 vahi police he
 He is the judge
 baaqi kuch nahin he
 i can not see this picture
 dilli police ke jawan aahat honge
 His officers did not support him
 court ke jajon ne saath nahin diya
 The Home Minister did not support
 main us jawan ke akelepan kii is ghadi main uske saath khadaa hum
 All the Delhi Police personnel should stop work and do Satyagraha
 upwas karen
 When the system does not support you, atone for it
 ishwar se prarthana karen ki vah unke afasaron ko naitik bal de
 Give duty unhen dar or samjhaute se mukt kare
 Iqbal main saket court ke vakil kaa paksh nahin jaanata lekin hinsa kaa paksh jaanata hum
 Violence cannot be favored
 agar yahi kaam police kisi vakil ke saath karti to main vakil ke saath khadaa hota
 Lawyers have sufficient capacity
 vivek he
 If something went wrong with them, they could fight it in another way
 ve dusron ko insaaf dilaate hai
 It is not right to decide out of court for your justice
 hamaari adaalaton kii puraani imaaraton ko dhwast kar nai imaaraten banani chahie
 Where the lawyers get better work facility so that their self-respect is also protected at the place of work
 yah bahut zaruri he
 There has been so much violence on the working space inside the court premises that due to this, even the lawyers will be angry
 barsaat main bhigane se lekar garmi main tapane tak
 Some court complexes in Delhi have improved but they do not seem to be enough
 nayaa hone ke kaaran saket court behatar he magar kaafii nahin
 No parking facilities outside these courts
 imaarat ke nirmaan main parking kii kalpana kamazor dikhti he
 Due to which there is tension on the day of arrival

 Hopefully, a judicial inquiry into the assault in the Tis Hazari court will give some way out
 doshi saamne honge or jhagade ke kaaran kaa samaadhaan hoga
 i wish the injured lawyers a speedy recovery
 kai log ise ateet kii ghatnaon ke aadhaar par dekh rahe hai
 Using the prevailing perception of lawyers and police
 tazaa ghatana kii satyata se pehle us par puraani dharanaon ko lad dena sahi nahin he
 Such a thing will never end
 aadhe kahenge police aisi hoti he or aadhe kahenge vakil aise hote hai
 The question is of the system
 system kaisaa he? system hi nahin he desh main
 Create system shaayad pehali baar hua he ki kisi mukhyamantri ne rajya ke daayre se baahar nikalakar desh ke naam chitthee likhi he
 Starting his three-day program almost a year before the Gujarat Assembly elections, Narendra Bhai Modi has told the country that he is fasting for unity, harmony and brotherhood
 siyaasi daanv khelnaa ho, virdohi ke nahale par dahala maarna ho to isamen gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 And that too aggressively
 lekin is baar modi ne chunaa he bilkul nayaa rasta, rasta upwas kaa
 In the letter written in the name of the country, Modi has written - My dear brothers and sisters, regards
 meraa ye abhiyaan samaaj or desh ke naam samarpit he jiskaa makasad he ekta or bhaichara
 Modi writes further
 
 
 gujarat mushkilon se nikalakar vikaas ke raste par aage badha
 Today there is peace, unity, social harmony and brotherhood
 bharat kaa itihaas gavaah he ki jatvaad or sampradayawad ne kabhi samaaj kaa bhala nahin kiya
 9 years after the Gujarat riots, Modi now realizes that the state runner should follow Rajdharma
 modi aage likhte hai, koi samaaj yaa rajya adarsh hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 i am thankful to those who have expressed my mistakes in the last 10 years
 ek mukhyamantri hone ke naate kisi bhi naagarik kii takalif meri takalif he
 It is the duty of the state to provide justice to all
 yani supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad modi utsahit to hai lekin kahin na kahin 2002 ke dangon ko lekar unhen malaal bhi he
 That is why Modi, who once believed in an all-out fight with opponents, is now talking about being soft towards him
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne likhaa he, 'teen dinon ke dauran main bhagwaan se prarthana karuunga ki mere man main un logon ke liye bure khyaal naa aaen jinhone mujhe yaa gujarat ko badnaam karne ke liye jhuthe iljaam lagaae
 It is clear that this time Modi has chosen the path of Gandhigiri to attack the Congress
 lekin sachai yahi he ki modi ke is upwas main unki badi mahatvakanksha chhipi he
 Modi sees himself as the future Prime Minister of the BJP
 pichley dinon jis tarah se american congresonal research kii report main unhen piem pad kaa daavedaar mana gaya he modi ko lagata he ki unke paas ek badhiya mauka he apni chhavi ko chamakaane kaa

 CAPF jawans with weapons entered the polling booth, while doing so is a violation of the code of conduct
 isamen dhyaan diya jaae ki chathe charan ke chunaav ke dauraan CAPF ke dwaara lathicharge or firing kii gai
 No local officials were included in the Quick Response Team in the first phase election
 baahar se ai kisi bhi force ko apni duty karne main pareshaani hoti he kyonki vah sthaneey bhashaa or ilaake kii jaankaree nahin hoti
 As a result, even after an hour of the complaint, the quick response team did not reach the spot as they were not aware of the area
 patr main likhaa ki CAPF ko atirikt sansaadhan ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, they have a local officer who can talk to the local voter
 isliye main guzarish he ki twarit pratikriya team main kisi bhi local officer ke nahin hone kii jaanch kii jaae

 shuruyaat se lekar aaj tak is duniya main insaanon ne tarakkee ke namaaloom kaise-kaise mukaam hasil kiye lekin isi tarakkee ke daud main usne apane ird-gird parmaanu bam aurhaidrogen bam jaise maut ke samanabhi juta liye
 Now these same things have become the biggest threat to the whole world because the new threat that a dictator has now given, believe if it is implemented, the whole world will be destroyed
 duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk yani america se dakshin korea kii dosti uske padosi uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ko kuch itani nagavar guzar rahi he ki usne iske khilaaf wo parmaanu yuddh chhedane tak kii dhamkee de daali he
 Had this threat been given a few days earlier, the world might have taken it lightly, but on January 6 this year, the way North Korea carried out nuclear tests and created half-a-world flames, now Kim Jong Un's Threats have engulfed the whole world, not just the US and South Korea
 fitrat se duniya pehle hi waakifvaise bhi baat-baat par apane dushmano ko goli maarane, junglee kutton or magaramachhon ke aage dalwane vaale kim jong un kii fitrat se duniya pehle hi waakif he or aise main agar vaaki ye taanashaah apni dhamkee par amal karata he to iskaa kab, kahaan, kitna or kaisaa asar hoga, iskaa gumaan khud kim jong un ko bhi nahin hoga
 Why did Kim Jong Un's tears come? In fact, the US and South Korea have launched two military exercises in the name of ki-resolve, the final decision and the Fol Eagle
 kii-rijolve ke tahat jahaan donon mulkon ke faujee sibar world main maujuuda jang ke khatre or usase nipatane ke taur-tareekon se waakif ho rahe hai, vahiin phol-eagle ke tahat unka jormadan-e jang menaamane-saamne kii ladaai or vyuh rachana par he
 While more than 17 thousand soldiers are taking part in this exercise on behalf of America, South Korea has engaged its 30,000 soldiers in this task and just by looking at these preparations, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un Is mounted haalanki taanashaah kim jong un ke is dhamkee bhare bayaanbaji par dakshin korea bhi khamosh nahin he
 Rather, a South Korean spokesman has made it clear that if North Korea does any irresponsible act, it will have to pay a heavy price
 dakshin korea ne to yahaan tak diya he ki unki fouj uttar korea main bilkul sateek or asardaar hamale karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he or wo ye bataa dena chaahate hai ki is jang main phir kisi tarah ke raham kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 However, this is not the end of the threat of intimidation
 balki ab to japan ne bhi uttar korea ko aisi kisi harakat se bachane kii do took chetavanee de di he
 It is a matter of concern that the world's most powerful and most dangerous bomb is in the hands of a freak dictator
 or wo bhi ek aisa bam, jo kisi bhi bade shahar kaa namonishaan bas minuton main mitaa de
 Recently, on the birthday of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, his scientists gave him such a dangerous hydrogen bomb gift
 6 or 9 agast 1945 ko japan ke do shaharon haroshima or nagasaki par hue parmaanu bamon ke ye dhamaake aaj bhi itihaas ke wo syah panne hai, jinhen yaad karne bhar se rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Then only two atomic bombs killed more than two and a quarter lakh people in these two cities of Japan
 ab jaraa sochie, us hidrogen bam kii jo in do shaharon par giraae gaye aise kisi bhi parmaanu bam se sau guna zyada shaktishaalee he
 If such a bomb is dropped on a city, what will be the result? Just understand that a hydrogen bomb can completely destroy any city with a population of crores and a half crores in minutes
 or yahi vajah he ki is vakt agar duniya main tabaahi kaa koi sabase bada saamaan maujuud he, to wo hidrogen bam hi he
 However, in September last year, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security raised doubts about developing a dangerous weapon at North Korea's Yangon Nuclear Complex
 think tanks ne satellite images ke aadhaar par bataaya tha ki north korea ne hydrogen bam banane kii takanic bana lee he
 And on 6 January, North Korea literally tested the hydrogen bomb
 exis of evills yani shaitan kii dhuriamerica ne kim ke desh par kai tarah kii paabandiyaan laga rakhi hai
 The US government calls North Korea the Axis of Evils, the axis of Satan, but it has rarely affected Kim Jong-un's health
 vah apni chaal chalata he
 Does your mind
 uttar korea kii janata kaa bhavishya ye taanashaah khud tay karata he
 Due to constant tension with South Korea and America, there are always war-like situations here
 isliye apni sainya takat badhaane ke liye ye taanashaah har ghar se logon ko jabardastee sena main shaamil karwaane kaa aadesh detaa he
 Not only this, to increase the strength of the army, girls also forcefully make soldiers
 uttar korea to is taanashaah kaa dansh jhel hi rahaa he
 But now it is also giving a shout to the rest of the world
 kabhi japan ko to kabhi america ko parmaanu hamale kii chetavanee detaa rahata he or ab to ye hydrogen bam se bhi las he
 Obviously, if it is not stopped soon, it can become a threat to the whole world

 Angered by the media's questions, the separatist leaders not only called the media personnel good and bad but also pushed the cameraman outside the NIA office
 jab algaavvaadi netaa naeem khan, faruk ahamed daar or javed ahamed baba dilli ke enie ke daftar pahunche to media ne unase kuch kade sawaal kiye
 He was angry at this
 naeem khan ne media ko 'chitr' qaraar diya to faruk ahamed daar ne media ke lagaataar puche jane par sirf itnaa kaha, yahaan har kisi ke sawaalon ke jawaab dene hi to aae hai
 Javed Ahmed Baba pushed the media cameras and entered the building

 The aim is to spread unrest in the valley
 vaise airport par bhi media unase sawaal poochta rahaa or yah algaavvaadi netaa jawaab dene se bachate rahe
 These three leaders were questioned for several hours by different officers at the NIA headquarters

 They are expected to get clues of the funding going on in the valley
 enie kaa kahana he ki algaavvaadi netaaon ko dilli bulaakar poochtacha karne ke myne hi alag hai
 a senior NIA officer told NDTV India that "the interrogation in the Valley is different, calling Delhi and inquiring here will send a message to other separatist leaders
" "tippaniyan Actually the NIA is trying to create a psychological pressure and calling Delhi and questioning these leaders is a part of that
 ek jaanch se jude afasar ne bataaya ki "abhi sirf inke khilaaf pii darj hui he
 Some important public meetings have been achieved
 " mangalvaar ko bhi poochtacha jari rahegi
 The NIA says that sequentially all events are being linked to how and to whom the money reaches
 udhar kendriya grih mantralay kaa kahana he ki pakistan na sirf patharbaji karvaa rahaa he, balki zyada se zyada aatankiyon ko ghati main bhejkar kai algaavaadi netaaon kii madad se maahaul kharaab kar rahaa he
 When the separatist leaders Naeem Khan, Farooq Ahmed Dar and Javed Ahmed Baba reached Delhi's NIA office, the media asked them some tough questions
 is par ve khafa ho gaye
 While Naeem Khan called the media 'cheater', Farooq Ahmad Dar said only when the media was constantly asked, he has come here to answer everyone's questions
 javed ahamed baba ne media ke camaron ko dhakka diya or building main ghus gaye
 All these leaders are alleged to have taken money from jamaat-ud-dawa leader Hafiz Saeed and other Pakistani terrorist organizations
 iskaa makasad ghati main ashaanti failaana he
 However, the media kept asking him questions at the airport as well and this separatist leader kept refraining from answering
 enie ke mukhyalay main alag-alag afasaron ne kai ghanton tak in teenon netaaon se poochtacha kii
 According to information received by NDTV India, the NIA and the police have collected 13 charge sheets related to last year's violence, which mention separatist leaders

 The NIA also has documents of cross-border trade on the Line of Control
 inamen ghati main ho rahi funding ke suraag milane kii ummid he
 The NIA says that calling the separatist leaders to Delhi and interrogating them is different
 enie ek varisht afasar ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki "ghati main poochtacha alag he, yahaan dilli bulaakar poochtacha karne se baaki algaavvaadi netaaon ko bhi sandesh jayega
 "comments darasal enie ek manovaigyanik dabaav banane kii koshish kar rahaa he or dilli bulaakar in netaaon se poochtacha usee kaa ek hissaa he
 An officer associated with the investigation said that "only PE has been registered against them
" kuch ahm jankariyaan hasil hui hai
 "inquiries will continue on Tuesday as well
 enie kaa kahana he ki silsilewar sabhi ghatnaon ko joda ja rahaa he ki paisa kaise or kis tak pahunchataa he
 On the other hand, the Union Home Ministry says that Pakistan is not only getting stoned, but sending more and more terrorists into the valley is spoiling the atmosphere with the help of many separatist leaders
 in sabhi netaaon par aarope he ki unhone jamaat-ud-daawa ke sargana hafiz said or anya pakistani aatankwaadi sanghathanon se paise liye hai
 The aim is to spread unrest in the valley
 vaise airport par bhi media unase sawaal poochta rahaa or yah algaavvaadi netaa jawaab dene se bachate rahe

 tyaagi ne kaha he ki bihar main jediu or argedy saath milakar chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 The JDU leader's statement came at a time when there were reports that Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal and Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal United are preparing to contest separate elections in the state elections in November
 in khabaron ke peeche tark diya gaya ki janata parivaar ke vilay kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa hone ke baavjood abhi tak is 'mahadal' ke liye 'ek chinh, ek jhanda or ek netaa' par nirnay nahin kiya ja sakaa he

 He further said, wherever elections are being held, people are supporting BJP and due to Modi's development work, the Congress will continue to lose badly till 2019

 Prior to the election, the BJP made a number of populist promises in its manifesto which attracted people
 lekin ab bijepi ke saamne yahi sabase badi chunauti he
 Because in fulfilling many such promises bjp's sweat can be missed

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mentioned in almost every rally during campaigning that his party will fulfill this promise in the first meeting as soon as his government is formed
 is vaade ke anusaar sabhi chote kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jayega, vahiin unhen byaaj mukt kar diya jayega
 At the same time, BJP has promised to pay the sugarcane farmers within 14 days of selling the crop
 gauratlab he ki is prachand jeet ke baad bijepi par is vaade ko nibhaane kaa dabaav he, or puure pradesh samet samooche desh kii nigahen sarkaar banane ke baad hone vaali pehali cabinet meeting par he

 sabhi college, uniwarsity main free vaai-fidilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii tarj par bijepi ne bhi is baar upi main free vaai-faai kaa vaada kiya
 The bjp's promise seems to have been well received by the youth of the state
 pradesh ke sabhi college or uniwarsity memphri vaai-faai dena bijepi sarkaarake liye tedi kheer sabit ho saktaa he
 Implementing this promise on a short time basis with a large budget will be a challenge

 The promise of free laptops along the lines of 1 GB datapoorly Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav with laptops as well as the promise of giving 1 GB free data will emerge as a major challenge for the BJP government
 akhilesh yadav ne lagaataar daawa kiya he ki unhone 15 lakh se zyada laptop baante hai
 It will be a challenge for the BJP to match this figure
 haalanki bijepi kaa aarope tha ki akhilesh sarkaar ne bhedbhaav ke aadhaar par laptop baante the or vah bina bhedbhaav ke saath laptop vitaran karegi

 vahiin bijepi ne ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki teen talaak ke mudde par vah muslim mahilaon se charchaa kar is par faisla legi, dekhnaa hoga ki vah is mudde par kis tarah aage badhati he
 While the BJP had promised to form an anti-romeo party to prevent incidents of molestation against women, this promise is being watched by all because the safety of women is an important issue in the entire state including western Uttar Pradesh
 iske alaava bhi bijepi ne kai vaade kiye hai jinhen puraa karne main bijepi sarkaar ko kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi

 Speaking to a gathering in the capital, Ahmadinejad said, "in the coming days, the world will witness the declaration of many major achievements in the nuclear sector," according to the news agency Xinhua
 " Thousands of Iranian citizens shouted anti-us and Israeli slogans at the Azadi Chowk in Tehran to celebrate the anniversary of the 1979 revolution

 As the MCD elections neared, political enthusiasts have started growing
 pehle jahaan bijepi kahati rahi he ki dilli kii ladaai aam aadmi party se he lekin ab bijepi ko lagane laga he ki is chunaav main asli ladaai congress se he
 BJP MP Vijay Goel strongly targeted the announcement of the Congress to celebrate the Black Day on the report of the Shunglu Committee
 vijay goyal ne kaha, 'emsidi chunaav main is baar aam aadmi party kii bajaae congress se takkar he
 AAP will be ranked third after the 272-ward MCD elections
 ' aapako bataa den ki dilli main 23 april ko emsidi chunaav hone hai
 Vijay Goel said that if the result is not clear in the MCD election, then Congress and Aam Aadmi Party can join hands for power
 to vahiin dilli kii janata congress kii shila dikshit sarkaar ke bhrashtachar visheshkar kaamanwealth game, sienji, lo floor bas or jal board tanker ghotaale abhi bhuuli nahin he
 The present Arvind Kejriwal government is following the Congress in corruption
 jo kal tak dusron ke khilaaf jaanch report lekar ghoomte the
 Today, he himself is escaping from the investigation reports
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki dilli kii janata kii jo aaj durdasha he, uske liye congress vartmaan kejariwal sarkaar se zyada doshi he kyonki aam aadmi party ko raajnneetik astitv main laane main 2011-12 main congress ne sahyog kiya tha
 And then in 2013, Kejriwal formed the government and started a period of inactivity, corruption and constitutional deadlock in Delhi
 saath hi dilli congress adhyaksh aaj nagar nigamon ko sakasham banane ke anek daawey kar rahe hai par janata ko yaad he ki 2002 se 2007 ke congress shasit nigam main dilli main kya haal tha
 As a result, the Congress lost badly
 jiske baad janata ne 10 saal tak bhaajapa ko chunaa or ab punah teenon nigamon main bhaajapa ko hi seva kaa mauka degi
 Vijay Goel said that the people of Delhi remember that the Sheila Dixit government split the Municipal Corporation in 2012 without thinking and then betrayed the East Delhi Municipal Corporation and did not give them 300 crores of seed money, at present The Kejriwal government has also been financially crippling corporations by following the same pattern for the last two years
 saath hi unhone kaha ki is chunaav main aam aadmi party tisare sthaan par khisak gai he or uske kaaran kejariwal dal baukhala gaye hai, par congress jo na centre or na dilli sarkaar main he na jane kis aadhaar par janata se dilli ke vikaas kii baat kar rahi he
 He said that both the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress are power-hungry and can re-align as soon as 2013
 dilli kii janata in donon dalon kii ghatiya raajnneeti ko samajhati he or behatar dilli ke vikaas ke liye bhartiya janata party ko samarthan degi

 On Thursday, the AAP filed a petition in the High Court demanding VVPAT to conduct MCD elections
 dilli chunaav ayog nemphatha mashinako lekar hoicourt main saaf kiya ki supreme court ne VVPAT ko chunaavon main istemaal karne ke liye kaha he, lekin supreme court ne yah kahin nahin kaha he ki janareshan van M-1 mashin ke istemaal par roak he
 M-1 is a non-hackable machine
 is mashin main kisi tarah kii chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati he
 It can be tested
 mashin kii vishwaneeyata par sawaal kaise uthaae ja saktaa hai, jabaki mashin par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagane vaali aam aadmi party ke paas is babat ek bhi saboot nahi he
 Making M-1 machines is as safe as using VVPAT
 VVPAT main printer hota he or iskaa istemaal karnaa kharchila hota he
 Hence, more funds are required for this

 Last week, a picture came from Shivpuri area of madhya Pradesh, in the picture some people who are having a picnic are seen stuck in the water
 wo sailaab tab apane saath nau logon ko baha kar maut ke munh main le gaya tha, lekin ab ham aapako isi haadase kii wo kahani bataane ja rahe hai, jise sunakar aap maut kii har chaal ko chalate khud mahasoos karenge
 Within three minutes, the feet were waving like water in the face of water, that scene was captured live in this video
 shivpuri main jal pralay se tabaahi kii nai tasviir saamne ai he
 The latest video of the accident has surfaced
 picnic ke dauraan achaanak kaise ai 'pralay'
 How the picnic spot became a witness to the war of life and death
 empi ke shivpuri main 15 agast ke din achaanak kaise aayaa tha sailaab
 The picnic of death in Madhya Pradesh will be revealed from the new video which has now surfaced
 kareeb 7 din baad saamne aae is video se saaf he ki sultangadh jharne kii chattan par picnic manaa rahe logon ko is baat kii bhanak bhi nahin lag pai ki usne peeche pani kii shakl main qayaamat aa rahi he
 15 August 2018 was a day off
 shaam kaa vaqt
 Hundreds of people were enjoying life in the Sultangarh waterfall of Shivpuri
 is baat se anjaan kii sailaab aane vaala he
 This is the area of parvati river in Shivpuri that passes through the hills
 aksar yahaan tak aate aate nadi suukh jaati he
 It becomes a great picnic spot for the people of the area
 us rose bhi yahaan pani naa ke barbar tha
 People were having fun that suddenly water started flowing in the river
 bahut teji se aayaa panipahle thodaa pani aayaa
 Then more water came
 jinhen khatre kii aahat ho gai wo fouran kinare kii taraf bhaagane lage
 See the photos, about half a dozen people hold each other's hands and move towards the edge
 bich raste main inkaa ek saathi pani kii dhar main phisal gaya
 But it showed intelligence and held one corner of the stone firmly
 ek taraf to pani kii dhar se jujh rahaa tha vahiin duusari taraf uske thik saamne
 About half a dozen people still could not understand that the matter was going to be serious
 phir unamem se do logon ne furti dikhaai or kinare kii taraf badhane lage
 While coming, these people also grabbed the hand of the person who was struggling to get out of the water's edge
 ek ek karke saare log kinare kii taraf bhaagane lage magar ye shaks akele hi pani se hote hue kinare kii taraf bhaagane kii koshish karne laga
 But the water did not allow him to handle it
 pehle wo phislaa
 Dropped again
 magar kisi tarah usne halaat par kaabo paaya or kinare par aakar apni jaan bachaa lee
 But still many people were stranded in the middle of the flood
 jinke liye ab is tarah daudkar yaa chalakar is sailaab ko paar kar paanaa naammumkin sa ho gaya tha
 Both the water and its speed started increasing
 parvati nadi par abhi tak jo pathar dikhaai de rahe the wo bhi pani main dub gaye
 The inundation has come completely
 ek ek karke log bahane lage
 Now there is no chance for anyone to do anything
 inke paas ab do hi raste the
 Either surrender in front of the inundation
 yaa phir laden maut se
 The lives of 45 people trapped in the flood were surrendered in front of this flood
 45 log fanse hue the
 They were trapped and were waiting for the flood to somehow reduce their anger and reach the shore
 yaa phir koi unhen bachaane aa jaae
 But time was short and the flow of water was getting faster every moment
 sab kuch baha le jane ko betaab is pani main bina taiyaari ke kisi ko bachaane kii koshish karnaa bhi khudakushi se kam nahin tha
 Imagine the water swell and only this rock to save lives for about 45 people
 haath kii pakad itani bhi majboot nahin ho sakati jo pani kii is bahaav main bhi pakad kaayam rakhe
 Were missing hands one by one
 pehle koi gira
 Then someone or phir to ek ke baad ek kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 In this way 12 people were swept away
 sailaab ke jo idhar khadey the wo idhar
 And those who were standing there
 haath malate rah gaye
 Who would dare to get down in this flood to save some life
 kyonki isamen utarane kaa matlab hi jaan ganvaana he
 It is a long time to reach them
 sailaab main maut se sidhaa muqablapani kaa itnaa tej bahaav jo baari se baari cheez ko bhi apane saath baha le jaae
 That is the will power of these people
 jo ye log laharon ke bich maut se muqabla kar rahe hai
 The flood that is desperate to shed everything, what will it wait so that the rope comes to save them
 yaa prashasan pahunch paae
 Because very little time is left now
 jab tak inaki ichha shakti kaayam he tab tak hi inaki saansen chal sakati hai
 Otherwise at any moment 45 lives perish in this inundation

 pashchim bengal main jai shri ram naa kehane par ek madrase ke teacher ke saath marpet karne kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The madrasa teacher has lodged a complaint that a group of people beat him up and pushed him off the moving train as he did not speak Jai Shri Ram
 sarkari railway police (jiarapy) ke ek adhikari ne mangalvaar ko is ghatana kii jaankaree di
 Let me tell you that this case has come up within just two days of the incident in Jharkhand, in which the mob beat up 22-year-old Tabrez Ansari for 18 hours
 use jai shri ram or jai hanuman kehane ke liye majaboor kiya
 He was beaten so much that he eventually died
 ab taaje maamle main pashchim bengal ke dakshin 24 pargana jile ke 26 varshiya madrasa shikshak hafeez mohammad shahrukh haldar ne kaha ki un par beeti guuruuvaar ko us vakt hamalaa hua, jab vah train se canning se hughali ja rahe the
 According to the official, Halder said that a group of people came to him and asked him to say Jai Shri Ram
 jab unhone jai shri ram kehane se manaa kiya to peetna shuru kar diya
 After this, when the train was about to reach the park circus station, they pushed them off the train
 haldar kii aankh or haath par chot ai he
 In this case, Haldar filed a complaint against unknown people in the Baliganj GRPS on Monday
 bataa den ki jharkhand main jai shri ram naa kehane par bheed ne ek shaks kii hatya kar di
 After which questions were raised on the Jharkhand government and the Modi government, then SIT was formed in a hurry
 jharkhand mob linching maamle main 11 logon ko giraftaar kar liya or do pulicekarmiyon ko suspend kiya ja chukaa he
 The politics on the issue of mob lynching is at a peak and questions are being raised as to when and how such incidents will stop
 bihar main shanivaar ko mahagathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ke bich siton ke samjhaute par aupchaarik ghoshnaa hui
 According to this announcement, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will contest Lok Sabha elections in only 20 seats since inception for the first time
 usne apane paanch sahyogiyon ke liye 20 siten chodi hai
 There are several reasons behind this generosity towards RJD President Lalu Yadav's Mahagathbandhan's allies
 siton ke is samjhaute se saaf he ki argedy adhyaksh lalu yadav (lalu Yadav) ne apane sahyogiyon ko unki kshamta ke anusaar yaa unke bare main apane akalan ke anusaar siten deen
 This time the seat agreement also shows that Lalu Yadav has got the idea that his traditional muslim-yadav vote bank will not be able to win more than four seats
 saath hi unako yah bhi andaja he ki is baar nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) unke saath na hokar unke virdohi endie (NDA) ke saath hai or nitish ke saath khaas taur par ek aisa majboot vot bank he jiskaa muqabla karne ke liye unhen apane saath har choti-badi party ko ekajute rakhana hoga
 Realizing the situation, perhaps Lalu Yadav gave only nine seats to the Congress, so that the central leadership of the Congress would not be happy with them, but Lalu Yadav took this risk
 unhone choti partiyaan, jaise upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party ko paanch or jithan ram maanjhi or mukesh mallaah kii party ko teen-teen siten dene kaa apana vaada puraa kiya
 At the same time, Lalu Yadav agreed to support the CPI-ML on one seat at the request of many party leaders
 lalu yadav ko yah bhi maaloom he ki unke maujuuda teen sahyogi pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke saath the
 At that time, despite providing all the resources to these allies, bjp's dream of coming to power was not fulfilled
 lalu iskaa kaaran jaanate the ki nitish kaa netritv or puraa chunaav jati, khaskar agada-pichhadaa karaane main safal hone ke kaaran satta mil pai thi
 Lalu Yadav and his allies will once again try to contest the elections on caste and local issues, as the NDA is still ahead in the electoral battle
 piem narendramodine kaha he ki baapu aaj bhi duniya main un lakhon-karodon logon ke liye aashaa kii kiran hai, jo samanta, sammaan, samavesh or shashaktikaran se bharpoor jivan jeena chaahate hai
 He said that there will be rare people who have left a deep impact on human society like him
 rashtrapitamahatma gandhiki jayanti 2 oktober ke avasar par kai akhabaaron ke liye likhe apane lekh main piem modi ne kaha, 'mahatma gandhi ne bharat ko sahi arthon main siddhant or vyavhaar se joda tha
 Even in the twenty-first century, Mahatma Gandhi's ideas are as relevant as they were in his time and he can solve many problems that the world is facing today
 'maanavtaa ko ekajute karne kii shaktipiem ne likhaa he, 'ek aisi duniya main, jahaan aatankwaad, kattarpanth, ugravad or vichaarheen nafrat deshon or samudaayon ko vibhajit kar rahi he, vahaan shanti or ahimsa ke mahatma gandhi ke spasht aahvaan main maanavtaa ko ekajute karne kii shakti he
 In an era where inequalities are bound to occur, Bapu's theory of equality and inclusive development can herald a new era of prosperity for millions of people living on the last rung of development
 'svachh bharat abhiyanpiem modi ne kaha, 'pichley chaar varshon main svachh bharat abhiyaan ke jariye 130 karod bharatiyon ne mahatma gandhi ko apni shradhanjali arpit kii he
 Due to the hard work of every Indian, this campaign has turned into a vibrant mass movement, whose results are commendable
 vaishnav jan to tene kahie, je pir paraai jaane re- yah baapuji kii sabase priy panktiyon main se ek thi
 It was this spirit that inspired him to live life for others
 ham, 130 karod bhartiya, aaj un sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye patibaddh hai, jo baapu ne desh ke liye dekhe or jiske liye unhone apane jivan kaa balidaan diya tha
 'explained the difference between need and greed' PM Narendra Modi said, 'more than a century ago, Mahatma Gandhi made a distinction between human need and his greed
 unhone prakritik sansadhano kaa upyog karte samay sanyam or karunaa, donon ke paalan kii salaah di, or swayan inkaa paalan karke misaal pesh kii thi
 He cleaned his own toilet and ensured the cleanliness of the surrounding environment
 gandhiji yah sunishchit karte the ki pani kam se kam barbaad ho or ahmedabad main unhone is baat par vishesh dhyaan diya ki dooshit jal sabarmati ke jal main na mili
 He said, 'the most beautiful thing about Gandhiji's personality was that he made every Indian feel that they are working for the independence of India
 unhone adhyaaapak, vakil, chikitsak, kisaan, majdoor, udhyami, sabhi main aatm-vishwaas kii bhaavana bhar di thi ki jo kuch bhi ve kar rahe hai, usee se ve swadhinata sangram main yogadan de rahe hai

 kabul main talibani hamale main ek vyakti pehle khud bas ke andar ghusaa, phir ek dhamaakaa or kai jindagiyaan khamosh
 The attack took place when security personnel deployed in security at the Canadian Embassy were leaving for their duty
 kabul main ye hamalaa us samay hua jab subah ke 6 baje sabhi surakshakarmi ek mini bas main savaar hokar ja rahe the ki achaanak ek speed braker par bas kii raftaar thodi dhimi hui, or ek aatmghaatee bas ke andar teji se ghusaa or palak jhapakate hi usne apni qamar par bandhi ardex vaali belt se khud ko uda daalaa
 Soon, more than 12 people flew away with him
 kuch aisi hi jaankaree bharat kii ambysi waalon ne usee hamale main kaal ke gaal main samaa gaye ganesh thapa ke bade bhai suraj ko di
 Ganesh has a 9-year-old daughter who probably does not even realize that her father will never return
 chauthi kaksha main padhane vaali supriya apni maa or sab logon ko ek saath dekh kar kuch samajhane kii koshish jarur kar rahi he, par use shaayad ye samajhane main abhi vaqt jarur lagegaa ki uske papa kii jaan aise logon ne lee he jisase uske papa kii kabhi koi dushmani nahin thi
 Similar is the condition of Ganesh's entire family
 maa gumsum he or patni kaa ro ro kar bura haal he
 The comments aisa hi ek doosraa parivaar bhi dehradun se hi he jis ghar ne apana chiraag kho diya he
 This house is Ganesh as well as Govind Singh who was killed in this attack, who was present in the same bus at the time of the suicide attack
 govind kii patni kaa bhi ro ro kar bura haal he, jise parivaar or aasapaas ke log sirf dilasa hi de sakate hai kyonki maut ke krur haathon ne govind ko unase hameshaa hameshaa ke liye chin liya he
 a few minutes before the attack, Govind called his wife, but Govind could not talk to his wife before the last time
 par apane antim samay main usne apni patni ko whatsap ke jariye ek massej kiya, "janu i miss you'' or uske baad ek dhamaakaa or sab kuch khatm
 Govind was making his own home in the beautiful plains of Dehradun, which he was getting prepared in a completely foreign style and which was also specially designed from Saudi Arabia
 par ab unka wo sapana sapana hi rah gaya
 The house is still incomplete and it is not in this world to get it ready

 On the issue of reservation in promotions, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has supported his demands
 paswan ne patna main ravivaar ko maang kii thi ki samvidhan main sanshodhan ho
 Nitish Kumar said in a press conference on Monday that the central government should take initiative on this issue
 zarurat ho tab sansad main bhi nijee kshetra main aarakshan ke mudde par bahes honi chahie
 According to Nitish, he will make the Central Government aware of the stand of his party on this issue
 tejasvi kaa nitish par palatwaar, bole- ghotaalon kaa 'manufacturer state' ban gaya he bihar Although there was a provision for reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Castes in the promotion in Bihar, this was stayed by the Patna High Court
 is par nitish kumaar kaa kahana tha ki rajya main is sambandh main niyam supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar banaaya gaya tha lekin hai court se roak lagane ke baad filhal iske kilaaf sarvocch nyaayalay gaya he jahaan is par sunwaayee chal rahi he lekin is bich main agar centre sarkaar is maamle main vyavdhaan dur karne ke liye koi pahal karti he to unki party iskaa swaagat karegi

 However, Nitish admitted that these are limited opportunities and not limited

 aarthik rup se pichhadon ke liye unhone kaha ki anya sarkari suvidha hai jaise chaatravruti yaa saaikal poshaak yojana
 Tejashwi hit back at Nitish, said - Bihar has become a 'manufacturer state' of scams haalanki bihar main pronnati main anusuchit jati or jan jati ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan tha lekin patna hai court ne is par roak laga di thi
 On this, Nitish Kumar said that the rule in this regard was made according to the order of the Supreme Court in the state, but after the ban from the High Court, it has currently gone against it to the Supreme Court where it is going on hearing but in the meantime if If the central government takes any initiative to remove the disturbance in this matter, their party will welcome it
 tippaniyan On the issue of reservation in the private sector, Nitish said that he wants all these issues to be debated but on the back of his demand, he took the name of socialist leader Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia and said that Lohiaji used to say that to get the same opportunity
 In that section, which is incompetent, special opportunity should be given to make it worthy of availing equal opportunity

 aamtaur par chamagaadadon kaa naam aate hi man main ashubh ashankaayen ubharne lagati hai lekin bihar ke vaishali jile ke sarasai gaanv va aitihaasik vaishali garh main chamagaadadon kii na keval puja hoti he balki log maanate hai ki chamagadad unki raksha bhi karte hai
 Tourists are thronged to see these bats at the historical site Vaishali Garh
 yahaan logon kii manyata he ki chamagadad samruddhi kii pratik devi lakshmi ke samaan hai
 Elder Kameshwar Yadav of Sarasai village claims that there is an illusion that bats are inauspicious
 unka daawa he ki chamagadad kaa jahaan vaas hota he vahaan kabhi dhan kii kami nahin hoti
 He said that today people in our village do not lock in homes, yet there is no theft in anyone's house
 ye chamagadad yahaan kab se hai, isaki sahi jaankaree kisi ko bhi nahin he
 Neeraj, a postgraduate student studying history, said that during the medieval period, there was an epidemic in Vaishali due to which a large number of people died
 isi dauraan badi sankhya main yahaan chamagadad aae or phir ye yaheen ke hokar rah gaye
 Since then, there has never been any kind of epidemic here
 sarasai ke pipalon ke pedo par apana baseraa bana chuke in chamagaadadon kii sankhya main vruddhi hoti ja rahi he
 The people of the village not only worship them but also protect these bats
 yahaan graminon kaa shubhakarya in chamagaadadon kii puja ke bagaiyr puraa nahin mana jaataa
 Scientists also say that the smell emitted from the body of bats destroys the viruses that are considered harmful to human body
 yahaan ke gramin is baat se khafa hai ki chamagaadadon ko dekhne ke liye yahaan saikadon paryatak pratidin aate hai lekin sarkaar ne unki suvidha ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya he
 Villagers said that last year, a pond situated on Vaishali stronghold had dried up, due to which more than 200 bats died, then the social workers of the area filled the water here which saved the life of bats

 300 mango trees have been grown on a tree at Kalimulla Nursery in Malihabad, famous for mango production
 yahi nahin is baar yahaan aam kii ek nai kism ijad kii ja rahi he
 It will be thin mango, juicy, its kernels will also be thin and will be digestible soon
 philhal iskaa naam nahin rakhaa gaya he
 District Magistrate Raj Shekhar and Senior Superintendent of Police Praveen Kumar visited Kalimulla Nursery in Malihabad on Wednesday at the request of Padmashree Kalimullah Khan
 kalimullah ne adhikariyon ko bataaya ki is varsh nursery main ek nai aam kii kism ijad kii ja rahi he
 This mango will have headlines (redness), it will be thin mango, juicy and its kernels will also be thin
 yah jaldi hi pachaane vaala hoga
 Padmashree Kalimulla has grown 300 mango trees on one tree and also showed mangoes of different species on them
 unhone bataaya ki yah nursery chaar acre main faili hui he
 He told that in the year 1919 there were 1300 mango orchards in Malihabad, which are now only around 700
 unhone 300 aamon main se ek kism pakistan ke aam kii bhi dikhaai, jo pakistan ke sindh ilaake se laakar lagaaya gaya he

 Do you remember the Taliban? He who invented new ways of death in Afghanistan and Pakistan before Baghdadi
 maanav bamon kii jhadi laga di thi
 The same Taliban that currently occupy more than half of Afghanistan
 ab ek baar phir afghanistan main use khuli aazaadee milane vaali he kyonki napha nakusaan dekhakar faisla karne vaale america raashtrapati donald trump ne 17 saal se afghanistan main maujuud america sena ko waapas bulaane kaa elaan kar diya he
 That means the Taliban is going to get a chance to stand up once again
 america sainikon kii ghar vapasamerica sena kii aakhri khep afghanistan chhodeygi
 7000 US troops will leave Afghanistan
 america sena kii ravaanagi se taliban or pakistan khush hai
 But India's decision may increase India's concern
 17 saal baad afghanistan se america sainikon kii vidaai ho rahi he
 The US has announced that it is recalling the last batch of US troops present in Afghanistan
 philhal afghanistan main kareeb 7000 america sainik hai
 This announcement by US President Donald Trump has caused worldwide panic
 is faisle se kai desh khush hai to kai naaraaz bhi hai
 Because the US Army has been fighting continuously against the Taliban while living in Afghanistan for many years
 amareeki netritv vaali gathbandhan senaaon ne saal 2001 main taliban ko afghanistan kii satta se baahar kar diya tha
 
 or tab se hi afghanistan main donon ke darmyaan sangharsh jari he
 Despite this, the Taliban still have about sixty thousand fighters
 yahi nahin afghanistan main taliban ke kabze vaale ilaakon main bhi izapha hua he
 This is the reason why experts consider it a suicide decision
 kyonki aisa hua to ek baar phir afghanistan taliban ke kabze main ja saktaa he
 Afghanistan was ruled by the Taliban from 1996 to 2001
 magar 9 / 11 hamale ke baad america ne afghanistan main talibaniyon par hamalaa bol diya
 Since then, the US military has been fighting against the Taliban
 usee kii koshishon kii vajah se hi afghanistan main loktantric sarkaar kaa gathan hua
 But now that the US government has decided to call back the army, the turmoil has started once again in Afghanistan
 darasal, america raashtrapati donald trump ko lagata he ki america ke liye afghanistan ek boj kii tarah he
 Which is not necessarily a strategic partner too
 trump ko ye bhi lagata he ki afghanistan main america sena ko rakhana aarthik rup se bhi nuksaandeh he
 Also, he is not getting the support of Pakistan to stop the Taliban
 lihaaza sena kii vaapasi hi america ke haq main he
 Although the Afghan government and the Indian government are unhappy with this decision of Donald Trump, the US defense minister is also not in favor of it
 unke mutabik raashtrapati kaa ye faisla aatmghaatee sabit ho saktaa he
 Because this decision can cause unrest across the country
 vahiin ye faisla taliban ke liye vardaan sabit hoga
 He will get a chance to reinvent himself
 ab trump kaa ye faisla sahi he yaa galat ye to aane vaala vakt batayega
 But Pakistan is very happy with this
 kyonki ek to afghanistan kii vajah se america or pakistan ke bich aksar tanatani rahati thi
 Secondly, he can also increase his interference in Afghanistan
 jo bharat ke liye sahi nahin hoga
 The Taliban, which has come into the limelight, has once again come into the limelight once again after the decision of the US which has been marginalized
 magar sawaal ye he ki aakhir america ne taliban ke saamne ghutane kyon tech die
 Because even after 17 years of struggle, the US military has not been able to completely liberate Afghanistan from the Taliban
 to iske liye taarikh ke un pannon ko palatnaa hoga jab is aatanki sanghathan kaa janm hua
 Actually, the Taliban is the name of the poet who has not lost any war till date
 uskaa dushman jab jab us par haaavee hua
 He cleverly retraced his steps
 khud ko majboot kiya
 The enemy attacked him as soon as he was careless
 itihaas gavaah he kshapani isi ranneeti ke chalate uske khilaaf har faujee muhim ne taliban ko or majboot, zyada khoonkhaar or pehle se kahin zyada khatarnaak banaaya he
 The Taliban started with the battle of occupation of Afghanistan
 mullah umr kii saraparasti main taliban ne 1994 ke aakhir main ye jang shuru kii thi
 During this time he faced tremendous opposition from local tribes in southern Afghanistan
 magar taliban ne haar nahin maani or sitambar 2006 main afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul par kabja kar liya
 The Taliban rule was defied by military commander Ahmed Shah Masood in 1997
 lekin agle hi saal talibandoguni takat ke saath ubhara or hajaaron ladaakon or aam logon kaa katl kar usne dobaaraa afghanistan par kabja jamaa liya
 This was just the beginning of the Taliban's bloody journey
 kyonki iske baad taliban dimak kii tarah dhire dhire puure afghanistan main fail gaya
 It came to such a point that till the end of 2001, 90 percent of Afghanistan was ruled by the Taliban
 taliban ke is ecchhatra raaj ko 2001 ke world trade centre hamalon ke baad america or saajha fouj ne ek aitihaasik chunauti di
 After this arrogance against the Taliban all over Afghanistan, the US seized power from the Taliban and made the Northern Alliance government in Afghanistan under its supervision
 magar barason chali is ladaai ke baavjood afghanistan ko taliban ke panje se wo aaj tak aaazaad nahin karvaa paaya
 The Taliban returned to Afghanistan once again in 2004 due to their nature and have been attacking the United States and joint forces intermittently ever since
 taliban ne kamobesh yahi tarika pakistan main bhi apanaaya
 Since 2006, the Pakistani army has fought against the Taliban on dozens of fronts
 taliban ne kai baar apane kadam peeche bhi khinche hai
 But as soon as Pak army returned to understand him as a loser
 taliban ek baar phir doguni takat se laut kar aayaa he
 That is, sometimes by agreement, sometimes with human voice, sometimes by referring to Sharia and Islam, sometimes in the name of Awam, the Taliban has been adopting every possible way to establish its feet

 In such a situation, what right does an ANI ask that Vadra ask the ground question? Few people would know that his father had a big brass business in Moradabad, then only a few people could understand the meaning of 'yeh Duniya Pittal Ki', otherwise the world could have belonged to Mittal having steel instead of Pittal
 kya aapako pataa he prithvi kaa lagbhag 70 pratishat hissaa pani main kyon he? taaki robert wadra use bhi apana na bana len

 sena pramukh bipin ravat ke bangladeshi nagarikon kii assam main ghuspaith or ol india united democratic front (AIUDF) par die gaye bayaan ne baad se raajnneetik vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 Left leader Vrinda Karat hit back at the army chief for this statement
 unhone kaha ki sena pramukh bipin ravat sena ke raajnneetikaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 He said that General Rawat is the head of the Indian Army and in our country, the Army has a tradition of staying away from politics
 hamaara niyam he or hamaara sanvaidhanik dhaancha he
 If they say once, then it could be understood that a mistake has been made, but they are making rhetoric again and again
 wo aise bayaan dekar sena ke raajnneetikaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Communalism is also fully there in his statements
 sipiem netaa vrinda karaatne is mudde par apil kii ki raashtrapati ko gambhirtha se maamle main sangyaan lenaa chahie
 Vrinda Karat said that the political statement of the army chief is very wrong and in this the President needs to take cognizance very seriously

 He said that whatever the case may be, but the field of army chief is not politics
 vrinda karaat ne kaha kisena pramukhkal ko kahenge ki mandir-masjid ke maamle par bhi ham bahes karenge, to kya yah tarika sahi he? vah kisi bhi desh kii nitiyon se jude mudde or raajnneetik mudde par koi bayaanbaji nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no need to make such statements to them
 wo itnaa zyada bayaanbaji kar rahe hai, maano kahin chunaav lard rahe hai
 Earlier on the Army Chief's statement, AIUDF Chief Badruddin Ajmal said that General Bipin Rawat's statement is inspired by politics, which is shocking
