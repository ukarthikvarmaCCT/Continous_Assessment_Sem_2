 In the last hearing, the court surrendered Rajaballabh Yadav and issued orders to go to jail
 court ne kaha tha jab tak peedita kii gavaahi na ho jaye tab tak yadav jail main rahenge
 The court had asked the government to record the statement of the victim in the trial court within 2 weeks
 darasal 16 saal kii naaballig se dushkarm ke aaropee va rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ke navada se nilambit vidhayak rajballabh yadav kii jamaanat radd karne kii maang vaali yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 It is clear from the court's order that Rajaballabh Yadav will remain in jail for the time being
 supreme court ne kaha, ye maamla naaballig ke saath rape or pokso act se judaa he
 We also have to see that there is a fair trial in this case
 yadav kii ore se kaha gaya ki jab tak trial puraa nahin hota wo bihar se baahar rahane ko taiyaar hai, jamaanat radd na kii jaae
 The Bihar government should not have accused the Chief Justice of the High Court as such
 aise to sab log jajon par aarope lagaate hue supreme court aa jaaenge
 Yadav's lawyer said that all the arguments of the state government are baseless
 aaropee MLA he to isliye rajya sarkaar is tarah ke aarope nahin laga sakati
 All the allegations of rape are false and there are many lies in this charge
 vahiin, bihar sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki yadav kii jamaanat radd kii jaani chahie
 Three weeks ago the High Court judge refused to grant bail, but after that the Chief Justice granted bail
 tippaniyan Even after the Supreme Court sent Yadav to jail, the statements of the victim were recorded in the court, but the statements of many important witnesses are yet to be recorded
 yadav is cese ke trial or gavaahon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Even in prison, he laid down all the rules

 Yadav said that till the trial is over, he is ready to stay out of Bihar, the bail should not be canceled
 bihar sarkaar ko is tarah hoicourt ke chif justise par aarope nahin lagaana chahie tha
 All such people will come to the Supreme Court accusing the judges
 yadav ke vakil ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii tamaam daleelein bebuniyaad hai
 If the accused is MLA then the state government cannot make such allegations
 rape ke saare aarope jhuthe hai or is aarope main kai jhol hai
 At the same time, it was said by the Bihar government that Yadav's bail should be canceled
 teen hafte pehle hoicourt ke jaj ne jamaanat dene se inkaar kiya tha, lekin iske baad chif justise ne jamaanat de di
 The comments supreme court ke yadav ko jail bhejne ke baad bhale hi peedita ke court main bayaan darj ho gaye, lekin ab bhi kai ahm gavaahon ke bayaan darj hone hai
 Yadav can influence the trial and witnesses in the case

 In the winter of 2007, the newly appointed General Secretary of the Indian Congress Committee, Rahul Gandhi, proposed that the Youth Congress official should be elected, not his selection
 rahul kii manshaa thi ki yuva congress ke daravaaje sabake liye khol die jaaen jo ab tak sirf rajnatik prishthbhumi yaa isse jude logon tak hi simit the
 a party general secretary says, "they wanted to create leaders who are free from familism and they are not caught by the disease of the Indian political system
" unki yojana thi ki jab ve party kaa netritv sanbhaalein, yuva netaaon kii yah paudh senior team kii jagah lene ko taiyaar ho jaae
 In this way a new kind of politics could be started in the country

 There has been talk of Rahul's coronation as president in this oldest party for a long time, but today, even after a decade, his ambition to build his young team with a non-political background does not appear to be fulfilled
 baharhaal, saatav loksabhaa main congress ke 44 sadasyon main se ek hai, lekin arshad 2014 kaa aam chunaav nahin jeet sake
 Later he was sent to the Karnataka Legislative Council
 hajarika ab bijepi ke vidhayak hai
 For this reason, the Congress vice president has had to depend on the same old brigade of leaders to revive the party in the states and at the center which he once wanted to get rid of

 ek anya ghatnakram main party alaakaman ne chunaav prabandhan samiti main amethi ke purv saansad sanjay singh ko shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya
 During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Sanjay Singh had threatened to contest against Rahul in Amethi soon after which he was offered a Rajya Sabha seat from Assam
 hakeekat yah he ki dilli kii gaddi se bedakhal hone vaali 78 varshiya shila dikshit par congress kaa bharosa jataana is baat kaa sanket he ki diggaj netaaon ke baahar hone ke baad unki jagah lene ke liye netaaon kii duusari pankti taiyaar karne kaa rahul kaa prayog naakaamayaab rahaa he
 This is also a big reason why Rahul is unimpressed in terms of starting the much-needed reshuffle at the top level by assuming the party leadership
 2014 kii shikast ne party ko vakt or mauka donon die, lekin tab se vah sirf reverse gear main chal rahi he
 In an informal conversation with journalists before the 2014 elections, Rahul had said that he was against giving tickets to people surrounded by allegations of corruption

 The command was then given to Asha Kumari, an MLA from Himachal Pradesh who is from a royal family and niece of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh

 Surprisingly, he did not get a big role
 "pehle rahul ne captain amarinder kii maang ke aage jhukate hue unhen punjab congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya tha, beshak iske liye unhen apni pasand pratap singh bajva ko barkhaast karnaa padaa tha
 Many insiders claim that this was a direct effect of the events in Assam where he joined the BJP after Rahul's repeated refusal to remove the tensions of party leader Hemant Biswa Sarma
 ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''rahul ne sochaa bhi na tha ki hemanth istipha de denge

 Unconditional recapitalization of the Government of India has also proved to be an ethical hurdle in this work as banks have not made any serious efforts on their part to achieve sufficiently good work or to reduce costs

 At the same time, it was also threatened that if the banks do not repair now, they will have to face serious consequences and this is definitely the last time that public money is being invested to get the Indian banking sector out of trouble
 aitihaasik najar se kaha jaae to yah baat pramanik nahin lagati
 The RBI said in the December 2016 Financial Stability Report (FSR), "this has actually triggered a debate as to whether there will be any new link to blow up money to recover the sinking money
" ''yah bahes darasal puraani he
 Since the early 1990s, state-run banks have been constantly in need of bailouts, cash flows, dilution of equity or some other form of government help

 euko bank sareekhe maamle saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon (piesbi) ke liye aam hai, lekin unki samasya keval dhokhadhadi tak simit nahin he
 Another major problem is that such banks start following the instructions of the government sitting in power
 lihaaja piesbi kii praathamiktaayen aksar sarkaar kii nitigat jaruraton par nirbhar rahati hai, bajaae kushal banking seva pradaan karne ke
 For example, the government's schemes of financial inclusion — such as the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana — mean that psbs have to invest their staff and resources in organizing credit fairs
 notebandi ne bhi piesbi ke maanav sansadhano ko duusare kaamon main laga dene main badi bhoomika nibhaai
 When the NPA crisis was at its peak, public sector banks had to spend months staffing crowds, silencing people's anger and counting notes due to demonetisation
 yah notebandi kii hakeekat thi
 Such preferences imposed on psbs further worsen their inefficiency

 But all these things are not in the headlines

 As a result, the Board's administration is weakening

 There is a lack of such reforms or even if there are reforms, then the pieces may not have much effect

 Obviously, the financial cost of inadequate reforms will be high

 The BBB at its level is also not completely against the government giving up control over psbs

 However, the right to appoint PSB board members means occupying more than 80 per cent of the Indian banking sector
 isliye uparokt daleel ke auchity ko lekar vitt mantralay ko raji karnaa jaruri jitna bhi ho, aasaan to nahin hoga
 The reality is that this crisis is exposing many pressing issues of India's moribund public sector banking system
 ek sarkari adhikari kaa kahana he, enpie kii taraf le jane vaali har baat kaa ek sahyogi kaarak bhi hota he or vah yah hakeekat he ki ''piesbi bhi darasal naukarshahi hi he, koi vyavsaay nahin

 vitt mantralay kii padtaal main pataa chalaa ki rajmarg se judi aisi kai pariyojnaayen hai, jinhen paryaavaran sambandhi hari jhandi milane se pehle hi karj baant die gaye
 2-ensure that the borrower's balance sheet is thoroughly investigated and cash flow protection standards are met
 vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, kai maamalon main bainkon ke paas itani visheshgyata nahin hoti ki ve rin aavedakon ke kagajaat ko acchhee tarah jaanch saken
 The result is that they are not able to capture the air-to-air profits and exaggerated figures, as was allegedly the case with Essar's projects
 philhal essar ke ye maamle neshnal companyj lau tribunel (ensielti) ke paas hai
 The result of securing cash flow will be that it can then be monitored to ensure that the given amount is not used for any other item as it will be mentioned where that amount is to be spent
 3-pariyojna ke vittaposhan se jude gaiyr-koshiya or baad ke jokhimon par dhyaan dena
 Non-fiscal risks are associated with bank guarantees and letter of credit
 isi tarah kii kagaji gadabadi ke aadhaar par neerav modi ne dhokhadhadi kii or is tarah usne ek bank kii guarantee ko duusare bank se lone lene main istemaal kiya

 saath hi, sambhav he ki isse bainkon ko aise korporate karjadaaron kaa bhi pataa chale jinhone jaruri jaankaree chipa rakhi ho
 According to the Finance Ministry, the same applies to Reliance Communications as it did not inform banks that it had taken a hefty amount from Chinese lenders
 5-kisi bhi consorcium ke pramukh bainkon ko takneekee-aarthik moolyankan karaane ke lihaaj se kshamta viksit kerani chahie
 Assessment and confirmation from secondary banks will help
 jokhim ke akalan or isse judi nigaraanee ke maamle main bainkon kii kshamta behad niraashajanak he
 Technical knowledge and expertise of the field is very important for the kind of projects coming up
 vaise bhi ye jokhim ke akalan or inke sambhavit aarthik pahalu ke lihaaj se jaruri hai
 If a bank cannot understand the potential technical scope of a project, it cannot even properly assess the risks and costs
 6-250 karod ru
 Banks should monitor the project with the help of experts after giving money in cases of loan of more than Rs
 consorcium se jude bank jaankaree ko saajha karen taaki sabhi ko sthiti kaa pataa rahe
 This is partly related to the techno-economic assessment point
 ab tak bade rin ke maamle main vishesh nigaraanee jaisi koi vyavastha na thi, bahari visheshgyon se to bilkul nahin
 Bankers are opposing this
 7 -kisi ek consorcium main keval nau bank honge or kisi rin main sahyogi bank 10-10 fisadi kii bhagidaari karenge
 It is seen that a defaulter usually stops paying a large amount by paying the small dues of consortium banks and seeking relief on the basis that they have made some payment
 iske saath hi, chote consorcium kaa prabandhan bhi aasaan hoga or chunki rin main har bank kii paardarshee or baraabar hissedari hogi, lihaaja jaanch parakh aasaan hogi
 8-consortium should have a standard online process of loan appraisal
 vittamantralay ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bhartiya bainkon (consorcium main lone dene vaale bank bhi) ke paas kai baar bhugtan se jude vilamb kii jaankaree ko saajha karne kii karypranali nahin hoti
 9 - The responsibility of the loan, its assessment, monitoring and recovery should be in the hands of different people
 kai bainkon main rin se judi puri prakriya ek-do logon ke haath main hoti he
 This increases the possibility of collusion / corruption and does not necessarily monitor after giving loan
 10-diwaala or diwaliyapan samhita main badlaav karnaa hoga taaki enpie khatadharak diwaala prakriya ke dauraan company dobaaraa na kharid saken
 This will ensure that the promoters responsible for the NPA compensate for it and also that they cannot benefit the bankrupt companies by buying the price of the loins
 11-enpie ke maamalon ko sidhe ensielti ke paas bhejne ke liye arabiai ko adhikrut kiya gaya he

 ek baar darshakon kii taraf se salmaan khan ko idi milegi jab salmaan kii film 'bajrangi bhaijan' id ke maukey par release hogi
 Seeing the trailer of the film, it would not be wrong to say that this film is also a Salman Khan type film which the audience likes to watch
 kabir khan dwaara nirdeshit film 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii kahani main hindustan or pakistan ke rishton ke halke phulke taar chhidenge kyonki ek pakistani khoi hui ladki ko uske vatan pahunchane kii jaddojahad karenge bajrangi bhaijan
 After seeing the promo, it is felt that the film will not lack emotion and drama as well as spices
 tippaniyan The character of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' is also a straightforward one, which Salman Khan considers as his own
 salmaan ne bataaya, 'ye kirdaar bilkul mere jaisaa he, sharif he, sidhaa saadhaa he or dusron ke kaam aata he
 Salman also said, "when Kabir told me the story, i immediately caught it
" sochaa ye kahani kisi or ke paas naa chali jaye isliye produs bhi kar diya
 ' is film se pehali baar salmaan khan nirmaataa bane hai or film 'ek tha tiger' kii jabardast safalataa ke baad ek baar phir is film ko lekar salmaan or kabir saath hue hai
 From the above, the story of the film is similar to the way in which Salman is liked
 isliye kahana galat nahin hoga kii is baar bhi salmaan ko idi mil hi jaaegi
 The story of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', directed by Kabir Khan, will lighten the ties between India and Pakistan as Bajrangi Bhaijaan will struggle to deliver a lost girl to her homeland
 promo dekhakar mahasoos hota he ki film main imoshan or drame ke saath-saath masaale kii kami nahin hogi
 The comments 'bajrangi bhaijan' kaa kirdaar bhi sidhaa saadhaa he jise salmaan khan apane jaisaa maanate hai
 Salman said, 'this character is just like me, is decent, is straightforward and helps others
 ' salmaan ne ye bhi kaha, 'jab kabir ne mujhe kahani sunai to maine foran ise pakad liya
 Thought this story should not go to anyone else, so it was also produced
 ' Salman Khan is the producer for the first time from this film and after the tremendous success of the film 'ek Tha Tiger', Salman and Kabir are together again for this film
 upar se film kii kahani bhi waisi hi jis andaaz main salmaan ko pasand kiya jaataa he
 So it would not be wrong to say that Salman will get Idi this time too

 It is often said about India that electricity has reached every village, but only on paper! This is said because according to government statistics, there are less than 3000 villages left in India where there is no electricity
 lekin, sarkaar bhi maanati he ki desh main chaar karod se zyada aise parivaar hai jinke paas gharon main bijli kaa conection nahin he or vah andhere main jeene ko majaboor hai
 The Modi government announced on Monday that it is now going to change this situation
 somvaar ko dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dinadayal upaadhyaay kii janmashti ke maukey par saubhaahgya naam kii yojana kii shuruyaat kii, jiskaa makasad he har ghar tak bijli kaa conection pahunchaana
 Inaugurating the scheme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he himself has studied in a kerosene lamp and therefore understands the fact that life is difficult in homes where there is no electricity
 unhone kaha ki saubhaahgya yojana se 2018 disambar tak har ghar tak bijli pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he, taaki desh main koi bhi ghar andhere main naa rahe
 That is, before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government would like to present it as one of its major achievements
 saubhaahgya yojana ke liye sarkaar ne 16,320 karod rupee kaa bajet rakhaa he or har ghar tak bijli pahunchane kaa 60 pratishat kharch centre sarkaar uthaaegi 10% kharch rajya sarkaron ko uthaanaa hoga or 30% bainkon se lone liya jayega
 The special feature of this scheme is that people will not have to spend any money to get electricity connection in their home
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki is yojana ke lagu hone ke baad bijli kaa conection paane ke liye sarkari daftaron ke baar baar chakkar kaatane kaa silsilaa bhi band ho jayega
 Because the government itself will go from house to house and install electricity connection and identify those people who do not have electricity connection yet
 prakriya ko aasaan banane ke liye mobile ap kaa sahaara liya jayega or log bijli ke conection ke liye aavedan dene se lekar sari kaarywahi mobile ke jariye hi puri kar sakenge
 The process of getting electricity connection will be completely free for poor people
 lekin baaki logon ko bhi iske liye sirf ₹500 kharch karne honge or vah bhi 10 kishton main bijli bill ke saath liya jayega
 In remote areas of the country where it is difficult to provide electricity connection to every house, the government will use solar power to illuminate the houses and people will also be given batteries, 5 LED lights and a fan
 saubhaahgya yojana se pehle modi sarkaar ne har ghar tak alpiji gas conection pahunchane ke liye ujjwala yojana chalaai thi jiske tahat ab tak teen karod silendar ke conection baante ja chuke hai
 In the elections of several states including Uttar Pradesh, BJP got tremendous benefit of Ujjwala scheme
 mana ja rahaa he ki saubhaahgya yojana ke peeche puri takat lagaakar bijepi agle loksabhaa chunaav main ise bhi apni ek badi kamyaabi ke rup main pesh karnaa chaahegi

 " The strong, popular and extraordinary personality of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa can be gauged from the stories, stories read and heard about them
 vah janata ke liye to pyaari 'ammaa' thim lekin media or raajnneeti main apane virodhiyon or samarthakon donon ke hi saamne unki chhavi kaaphi sakht hi rahi
 Such a politician who did not like to open all his secrets, all his cards in front of his close ones, then the media became a distant thing
 (padhein - ammaa jinhen naa sunanaa pasand nahin tha) One such famous incident is when Jayalalithaa interviewed journalist Karan Thapar for BBC World's program "hardtalk India"
 yah saakshaatkaar kaaphi charchaa main rahaa kyonki jayalalita ko thapar ke kuch sawaal pasand nahin aae
 The matter even reached that at the end of the interview when Thapar shook hands with the Tamil Nadu CM and said that it was nice talking to you, Jayalalithaa gave Mike a 'slap' saying that 'but i did not like talking to you at all
 ' This interview has been seen many times on youtube but what is not shown is the part after this interview
 un dinon varisht patrkaar parvaiz alam, bibisi ke is kaarykram ke produsar hua karte the or landan main rahete the
 He wrote in a Facebook post recalling the interview that Karan Thapar was not allowed to leave the room immediately after this interview of Amma in Chennai
 aaie padhein parvaiz ne kya likhaa he - The day Karan Thapar was stopped from going out after Amma's interview
 
 
 main bibisi world ke is kaarykram 'hardtalk India' kaa landan besd produsar tha jab 2004 main karan thapar ne hamaare liye jayalalita ko intervyuu kiya tha
 Yes, the same interview which is discussed a lot
 
 Karan got a call from me when the day was climbing in London
 unhone dhimi awaz main kaha ki chennai main mushkil khadi ho gai he kyonki jayalalita is intervyuu se bahut zyada naaraaz hai
 The tension started when Karan asked Jayalalithaa during the interview not to read her answers
 yah thi un donon kii baatcheet - K: (interrupting) you are reading the statement je : (tokate hue) main pard nahin rahi hum
 i am looking at you and talking
 aap camera main dekh sakate hai
 K: But I'm saying
 
 J: I'm looking at you and talking
 
 i am not reading ke : main aapse judi ek baat poochna chahta hum

 And nothing can stop me from reading them ke : chif ministar
 
 je : main pard nahin rahi hum
 
 
 i am talking with eyes in your eyes
 main sabake saath aisa hi karti hum After the interview was over, Karan Thapar felt that he had been barred from leaving Jayalalithaa's office as there were some police officers present who were not allowing him to leave
 aakhirkaar unhone matlab kii baat kah di
 J's office wanted Karan to record this interview again as Madam CM is not happy with this conversation and the questions asked in it
 karan ne kaha mujhe landan baat kerani hogi
 So they called me

 On this post, Ashok Upadhyay, the producer of the event in Chennai, has written that during the interview, there was a lot of tension between Thapar and Jayalalithaa and pressure was put on him to record the conversation again
 lekin acchhee baat yah thi ki jayalalita intervyuu ke bich se uthakar nahin gayi or unhone har sawaal kaa saamana ek sherni kii tarah kiya

 Ram Rahim can be booked under Passport Act for giving false information in passport
 ram rahim ke donon passport main baari kamiyaan pai gai hai, jo niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaati hai
 These facts prove that the officers and employees posted in Haryana Government and Passport Office had issued passports by flouting the rules
 saal 2015 main pehali baar jari kiye gaye passport main ram rahim ne sir par topi pahani he
 According to the rules, the cap used for the passport cannot be worn in a photograph
 sutron ke mutabik ambala ke riginal passport karyaalay dwaara jari kiye gaye is passport ko aadhe ghante ke bheetar hi ram rahim ko saunp diya gaya tha
 The passport office usually opens at 9 am, but in 2015 the staff of the Ministry of External Affairs reached the office at 8:00 am to issue Ram Rahim's passport
 usee samay passport kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 This passport issued under the Tatkal category by the then passport officer Rakesh Aggarwal was against the rules
 jab karyaalay khulne kaa adhikrut samay hi 9:00 baje he, to 8:00 baje kaise ram rahim kaa prarthana patr sweekaar kiya gaya
 a certificate of advance police verification was also attached to get an instant passport
 passport mengurmeet ram rahimake naam ke aage sant gurmeet ram rahim insaan likhaa gaya, jabaki niyamon ke mutabik yah galat he
 The person making the passport is only allowed to use his real name
 ram rahim sirf apane asli naam gurmeet singh ke naam se hi passport banavaa saktaa tha, lekin niyamon ko taak par rakhaa gaya
 After the Prime Minister's clarification, the UPA is now preparing to counter-attack the opposition in the coal allocation case
 darasal, ab upie dohari ranneeti par kaam kar rahaa he− janata ke bich bijepi ke prachaar kii kaat kii jaae or raajnneetik birdari main bijepi ko is mudde par alag−thalag kiya jaae
 Now the question is, what is the way after this uproar in Parliament
 
 
 sarkaar do baton par vichaar kar rahi he yaa to sansad kaa satr anishchit kaal ke liye taal diya jaae


 yaa phir sarkaar loksabhaa main vishwaas mat laae
 The government feels that these two ways can isolate and disparage the BJP
 yani ab upie puri tarah bijepi ko gherne kii taiyaari main he
 The comments idhar, enditivi india se baat karte hue kanoon mantri salmaan kurshid ne ishaara kiya ki sibiai kii jaanch ke daayre main vipakshi dalon kii rajya sarkarein bhi aa sakati hai
 Khurshid said that the CBI is investigating, if any allegation is raised against the state governments or a finger is raised, the CBI will examine it objectively and present all the facts before the court
 paigaam saafe he
 BJP should either let Parliament run or be prepared for any kind of power test

 or the government should bring confidence vote in Lok Sabha
 sarkaar ko lagata he ye donon raste bijepi ko alag−thalag or benaqaab kar sakate hai
 That is, the UPA is now ready to completely surround the BJP
 tippaniyan Speaking to NDTV India here, Law Minister Salman Khurshid hinted that the state governments of opposition parties may also come under the purview of the CBI
 kurshid ne kaha ki sibiai jaanch kar rahi he, agar rajya sarkaron par koi aarope lagata he yaa ungali uthati he to sibiai uski nishpaksh jaanch karke saare tathy court ke saamne pesh karegi
 The message is clear
 bijepi yaa to sansad chalane de yaa kisi bhi tarah ke shakti pareekshan ke liye taiyaar rahe

 He is against many important bills anyway
 congress kii manshaa he ki jin chah bilon ke liye rahul gandhi jor laga rahe hai ve kisi tarah paas ho jaaen
 All these bills are anti-corruption

 On the very first day of the first monetary review meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) till Thursday, the Supreme Court has given a big blow to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 supreme court ne pareshaani vaale bahikhaaton ke bare main rigerv bank ke ek circular ko radd kar diya he
 The Supreme Court stated that it is not under the jurisdiction of the RBI
 aakhir kya he puraa maamla or iskaa kya hoga enpie or bainkon par asar, aaie jaanate hai
 What was the matter? On February 12 last year, the Reserve Bank had issued a circular directing banks to make a default in the category of stressed account if there is a default of one day after the payment deadline of a loan account
 is circular se corporate jagat kaaphi baichaiyn ho gaya
 Actually, joining a distressed account means that if the issue of default was not resolved for 180 days, then the bank would have been forced to take the defaulter company to the backrapshi court
 pehle companiyon ko karj vaapasi ke liye zyada samay dene kii suvidha ke liye kai tarah kii lone ristraccharing skim pesh kii jaati thi
 Why the circular was brought In fact, the Reserve Bank had to bring such a circular after the introduction of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
 ibisi se pehle karj ke difalter haaavee rahete the, bank unako karj kii ristraccharing ke dwaara chukaane ke liye zyada samay dete the taaki unhen aise lone ke liye provijaning na kerani pade
 But this increased the problem further
 kya hua tha asarsarcular ke baad bainkon ko apane lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ke tahat rakhana padaa
 This has resulted in a loss of Rs 16,600 crore to 21 public banks in the first quarter of FY 2019
 disambar, 2018 tak bainkon kaa enpie badhkar kareeb 11 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 Who protested on August 27, 2018, the power companies went to the Allahabad High Court and demanded a ban on this circular of the Reserve Bank, but they did not get any relief from the court
 bijli companiyon ke upar kareeb 1
 73 lakh crore rupees were loaned
 kai sarkari vibhaagon dwaara bill nahin chukaaya ja rahaa tha or bijli companiyaan inase kareeb 34,000 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa nahin vasuul paa rahe the
 Later many other sector companies also moved the Supreme Court
 11 sitambar, 2018 ko supreme court ne is maamle main yathasthiti barkaraar rakhte hue arabiai ke circular ko chunauti dene vaale sabhi maamalon ko apane paas transfar karne kaa aadesh diya
 On December 11, 2018, the then Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel resigned
 unke istife kii ek pramukh vajah circular ke maamle main sarkaar se matbhed ko mana jaataa he
 On February 7, 2019, the new Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das denied any change in the circular
 lekin 2 april, 2019 ko supreme court ne rigerv bank ke circular ko radd ghoshit kar diya
 The Supreme Court said that the Reserve Bank can direct that in case of default, the bank should take action against a company, but in general it cannot give such instructions about the common borrowers
 ab kya karenge bankpahale bhi bank 'mushkil' vaale sector yaa company ke prati sachet rahete the
 After the end of the 90-day default period, banks used to initiate action against the potential defaulters
 haalanki ve companiyon yaa vyaktiyon kaa naam saarvajanik karne or recovery tribunel main jane se hichakate the
 Even now banks will not be prevented from making more provisions for their stress account
 kai baar bank apane profit zyada dikhaane ke liye aise stress vaale acount kii jaankaree chipa jate hai
 This is clear from the difference in the NPA data of the Reserve Bank and the banks
 bainkon ko apane stressd acount ke liye provijaning main zyada eemaandaaree dikhaani hogi, kyonki aakhir agar koi stress acount enpie nahin banataa to yah provijaning munaafe ke rup main waapas aa hi jaati he
 Project Empower Banks already has a 'project Empower' option to deal with stressed accounts of over Rs 500 crore
 iske tahat unhen asset management companiyon or alternet investment fund (AIF) kii madad milegi
 The Indian Bank Association will have to create a vibrant AMC and AIF model in an active manner
 investment banker jaisaa kaam karnaa hogabainkon ko ab investment banker jaisi bhoomika main jaakar pareshaani vaale fermon ke liye kharidaar talashne main madad kerani hogi
 They can meet the leading investors of India and abroad and talk to potential buyers
 isse bikne vaali company ko acchhee keemat milegi
 Rigorous Credit Assessment Banks will have to formulate stringent credit assessment rules to avoid difficult situations
 kai nijee bainkon ne sankatagrast sector kii companiyon ko karj dene ke maamle main sachet ravaiya apanaaya he
 Public banks also have to rethink their risk model in terms of loans
 rigerv bank ke saamne ye hai vikalp1
 The Reserve Bank can file a reconsideration petition in the Supreme Court 2

 desh main pyaaj kii mandiyon main vyapaariyon kaa dabadabaa he tathaa sathganth or jamkhori ke chalate pyaaj kii keemten prabhavit hui hai
 This has been revealed in a study by the Competition Commission
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he, pyaaj kii mandiyon main spasht rup se ghalmail he or sathganth hone ke chalate keemten chadhi hai
 The study conducted by the Bangalore-based Institute for Social and Economic Change for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) analyzed competition in the major onion mandis of Maharashtra and Karnataka
 tippaniyan According to the report, seasonal fluctuations, intra-day, daily, monthly arrivals etc
 indicate clear presence of anti-competitive elements in onion markets
 report main kaha gaya he, kuch bade vyapaariyon kaa anya bazaaron main bichauliyon ke saath badhiya sathganth he, jisase keemten badhane kii ummid main jamkhori kii disha main kadam uthaaya jaataa he
 According to this, traders are making the onion market not farmers
 pyaaj ke bazaar mulya main utaar-chadhaav pyaaj ke rakabe main ghat-bad yaa mausami paristhitiyon kii bhoomika bahut thodi he
 Most of the business is in the hands of commission agents and traders
 zyaadaatar kisaanon main vyapaar karne kii kushalta kii kami, bazaar kii uchit jaankaree na hona or jokhim uthaane se parhez karnaa aise kaarak hai, jinaki vajah se kisaan pyaaj ke bazaar ko prabhavit nahin kar pate
 The study says there is a clear mix of onion mandis and prices have risen due to connivance

 The report states that some big traders have good nexus with middlemen in other markets, which leads to hoarding in the hope of increasing prices

 The fluctuations in the market price of onion have little role in onion acreage or seasonal conditions
 zyaadaatar kaarobaar kamishan agenton or vyapaariyon ke haath main he
 In most farmers, lack of business efficiency, lack of proper market knowledge and avoiding risk, are the factors that do not affect the onion market

 Shiv Sena ministers met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday after the state cabinet

 The comments bijepi ke liye shivasena kii yah sharnaagat haalat bal denevaali he
 On the pretext, the BJP did not miss its ally
 party ke varisht mantri girish bapat ne jate-jate shivasena ko sachet kar diya ki raajnneeti main koi sthiti sadaa ke liye nahin hoti
 The Shiv Sena may have upset the BJP, but their strategy for power seems completely different
 isse kul milakar ek baat samajhi ja sakati he ki satta kaa jaadui jod he jo aasaani se tuutegaa nahin
 Sources reveal that in this meeting, Shiv Sena ministers urged the Chief Minister to intervene to end the tension between the two parties

 Congress leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has given a controversial statement about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 unhone bijepi kii tulana veshyaaon se kar di he
 Siddaramaiah said, 'prostitutes cannot complain about the dance floor
 jo dancers dance nahin kar paati hai, ve dance floor ko lekar shikaayat karti hai
 By this i meant BJP, not anyone else
 'karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya se jab poocha gaya ki gathbandhan sarkaar girane ke baad har jedies kaaryakarta unhen isaki vajah bataa rahaa he
 Siddaramaiah said that the prostitute who cannot dance, complains about the floor
 siddharmaiya jab yah bayaan de rahe the tab unke saath karnataka mahila congress kii netaa bhi baithi thim
 This is not the first time that Siddaramaiah has made such a disputed statement, even before that he has been accused of insulting women and making controversial statements
 vivaadon se purana nathapahle bhi siddharmaiya kaa ek video bhi viral ho chukaa he jisamen vah ek mahila ke saath abhadrata karte or use saream dhamkaane najar aa rahe hai
 However, as the controversy grew, Siddaramaiah said that the woman is like his sister
 unka koi galat iraadaa nahin tha
 Apart from this, in a group photo of June 2016, a woman named Girija Srinivas gets excited and kisses Siddaramaiah's cheek, the incident was also criticized
 girija chikmagalore jile ke amritapura se tarikere taluk panchayat kii sadsy thi

 CAG ne rafel ke moolyasambandhi jaankariyon kii jaanch kii he or kaha he ki yah 2
 86% less
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki court jo bhi maangega sarkaar raphal sambandhi dastavej prastut karne ke liye taiyaar he
 There are no grounds for reconsideration petitions on Rafale Deal, so all petitions should be dismissed
 aapako bataa den ki disambar ke apane faisle main adaalat ne kaha tha ki vartmaan jaise maamalon main mulya nirdhaaran vivaran kii tulana karnaa is adaalat kaa kaam nahin he
 Now the court will hear the matter on 6 May

 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke kathith saale sanjay singh ke pramotion ko lekar congress ne sawaal uthaaye hai
 The Congress alleges that Chief Minister-in-law Sanjay Singh started his job as a class three employee in Madhya Pradesh, but after the formation of the state of Chhattisgarh, he had to live in the tourism department in 3 years against the rules
 em

 By the year 1993, he was able to reach the senior tourist officer, which is a class two post
 haalanki jaise hi madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh kaa vibhaajan hua or wo chhattisgarh aaye unki tarakkee kii speed achaanak bad gai
 In 2005, he was directly promoted from Class Two Officer to DGM of Chhattisgarh Tourism Department, which is a Class One post
 iske baad 2008 main unhen ji

 pad se nawaja gaya
 In 2010, with the signature of Chief Minister Raman Singh, he was sent to the Transport Department as Joint Commissioner
 2013 tak sanjay singh transport vibhaag main hi rahe
 In 2013, Sanjay Singh was again given the posting of GM in the tourism department, where he is still working
 sanjay singh kaa apni safai main kahana hai ki unhen kabhi bhi anuchit pramotion nahin mila or na hi unhone mukhyamantri se rishtedaari kaa daawa kar koi phayda uthaaya
 According to him, his promotion case is pending in the Bilaspur High Court
 baavjood iske unhen bevajaah nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Actually, Sanjay Singh came to know when the Additional Secretary posted in the Ministry of Chhattisgarh, based on the letter of a complainant, clearly used the words 'act of the Chief Minister's brother' in the government notesheet and sent that notesheet to the tourism department
 
 'mukhyamantri ke saale ke karname vaale' sambodhan ke chalate maamle ne tool pakad liya
 Not only this, a notice has been issued on behalf of the ministry in connection with the non-essential work of Rs 6 crore on Sanjay Singh
 in sarkari dastavejon ke ujagar hone ke baad sanjay singh congress ke nishane par aa gaye
 However, he also says that he has no direct relationship with Chief Minister Raman Singh
 chunki ve mukhyamantri kii patni veena singh ke gaanv ke hai, isliye log unhen mukhyamantri kaa saalaa-saalaa kehete hai
 On the other hand, after catching up with the matter, the departmental minister has assured to investigate the matter
 duusari ore mukhyamantri raman singh is maamle par chuppi saadhe hue he
 After catching up with the case, it is expected that Raman Singh himself will reveal the secrets about the 'alleged brother-in-law of the Chief Minister'

 kuch logon kaa yatra kaa masik bajet 50 pratishat tak bad gaya he
 It is seen that the increase in Metro fares has increased congestion in roads and buses

 Delhi Women Commission believes that the increase in Metro fares will affect women and girls as well as citizens of Delhi
 lihaaja ayog sifarish karata he ki metro ke badhaaye jane vaale kiraaye ko turant roka jaae or dilli ke nagarikon par metro kaa kiraaya badhaakar aarthik boj na daalaa jaae
 Swati Jai Hinde has written to Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri in his letter, citing Section-6 of the Delhi Women's Commission Act, that the government should consult the Delhi Women's Commission in all matters related to policy affecting women 
 unhone kaha ki ayog sifarish karata he ki maamle ko lekar ek cameti banaai jaae, jisamen centre or rajya sarkaar ke adhikariyon ke alaava dilli sarkaar ke chune hue pratinidhi, finance va soshal export or dilli mahila ayog shaamil hon, jo metro ke liye kiraaye ke alaava duusare madhyamon se revenue badhaane ke vikalpon ko talashne main madad kare, taaki logon par kiraaya kaa boj na daalaa jaae

 This is the truth, make it clean
 
 
 " gayika shivani kashyap ne is mishan geet ko dilli bijepi ke kaarykram main gunagunaaya tha
 In the second week of October, Delhi BJP announced Navratna for its cleanliness campaign, nine brand ambassadors
 unheen nau ko lekar yah mishan geet taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The mission song starts with the word "come, bring nine", that is, every person of Navratna should join the nine and thus the cleanliness campaign turns into a mass movement, because 'this is true, true, clean clean
 
 
 ' us kaarykram main kendriya shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu bhi maujuud the
 State BJP President Satish Upadhyay, while revealing the names of the nine brand ambassadors, had also stated his purpose that all these nine people will separately make nine people as brand ambassadors
 is tarah se dilli main swatchta abhiyaan jan-jan main fail jayega
 The names of the Navratnas of the cleanliness drive are - Shazia Ilmi, Olympic winner Sushil Kumar, Delhi University Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh, Dr
 KK Aggarwal, Kathak Ustad Uma Sharma, Delhi University Students Union President Mohit Nagar, Praveen Khandelwal, DCM Group's Vinay Bharat Ram and India Islamic Center President Sirajuddin Qureshi
 in navratnon kii ghoshnaa ke vakt kendriya shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu bhi the
 In this program Shazia Ilmi rightly praised Narendra Modi and said that this is a great campaign
 safai ko sirf safai karmchaariyon kaa kaam nahin mana janaa chahie
 We also have the responsibility to clean the country
 is tasviir se bijepi ne aam aadmi ko rajnatik chikoti bhi kaat lee thi, lekin ek maheene baad shazia or sirajuddin kii tasviir bijepi ko chikoti kaat rahi he
 If there was a program of India Islamic Center, then its president was included in the Navratnas of cleanliness by BJP
 sirajuddin kuraishi ek namchin hasti hai, udyogpati bhi hai or duniyabar main unki saakh he, lekin unke kaarykram se agar pradhanmantri ke dil ke kareeb is abhiyaan kii jagahansai ho rahi he to satish upaadhyaay ko kuch to karrwai kerani hi chahie
 He cannot escape saying that the campaign was not his
 unke brands ambaseder kaa tha to unka bhi hua
 Will he exclude Sirajuddin Qureshi from the Navratna group
 kai baar mukhya atithi aise maukey par funs jate hai
 We are also photographed and trapped
 lekin upaadhyaay se kuch galtiyaan hui hai
 Did he not know in which program he is the chief guest
 kya unhen nahin pataa tha ki india islamic centre jis lodhi road par he, vah aamtaur par saaf hi rahata he
 Leaves and leaves fall from the trees, which melt down and turn into compost
 inhen hataakar kahin jalaana to or bhi gunaah he, jisase hawa main pradooshan failata he
 Should know where those leaves were taken for the funeral
 india islamic centre ke is kaarykram kii jo tasviir he, vah agar vivaadon main na fansati to is chunavi mausam main bijepi ke liye ek rajnatik chhavi bhi gadhati, jiskaa sambandh safai se kam, vot bank se zyada he
 In this election season, Qureshi, Ilmi and Upadhyay could also go to Okhla, where the Yamuna edge is dirty, for cleaning
 jaise rajnath singh gomti nadi ke kinare gaye or shashi tharur ne bhi nadi kaa kinaaraa chunaa
 What is the point of cleaning campaign in such clean places
 soshal media se lekar media tak main upaadhyaay, ilmi or kuraishi sahab kii tasviren viral ho gayi hai
 The Prime Minister's program is mocking everywhere
 bijepi ko 'chalata he' tip khaarij karne ke bayaan se zyada thos karrwai kerani chahie, taaki yah sandesh jaae ki narendra modi ke bataae raste par chalane main unke samarthak agar nautanki karenge to yah bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 The Aam Aadmi Party and Congress have bridged the social media with these pictures
 virodhiyon ne is tasviir ko hording par utarkar dilli kii galiyon main laga diya to party ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 By the way, common people are also very angry with this action

 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan par abhi bhi koi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 Nationalist Congress Party leader Chhagan Bhujbal has said that if the issues are not resolved, his party will support the Congress from outside

 unhone maang kii ki padon kaa bantwaaraa varsh 1999 kii tarj par hona chahie
 Earlier, the Governor of Maharashtra met with the caretaker Chief Minister Ashok Chavan and Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal in view of the delay in forming the government
 ahm padon ko lekar khinchataan jarividhansabha chunaavon ke parinaam kii ghoshnaa 22 aktubar ko ho gai, lekin nai sarkaar ne ab tak shapath nahin lee he
 There is a delay in forming the government due to the ongoing tussle between Congress and NCP over the division of departments
 satta kaa formula ab bhi uljhaamaharashtra main satta kaa formula ab bhi ulajhaa hua he
 Both the Congress and the NCP are eyeing some creamy portfolios
 idhar sarkaar banane ke liye daawa pesh karne kii aaj aakhri taarikh he, aise main congress ne apane tevar main kuch narmi ke sanket die hai
 The desire for creamy positions continues in Maharashtra, with the creamy positions continuing
 satta kii saajhedaari kaa nayaa formula kya ho, is baat par congress auki ensipi main matbhed ab bhi barkaraar he, lekin mushkil ye he ki vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal aaj khatm ho rahaa he or nai sarkaar ke gathan kaa maamla or zyada nahin taala ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the Congress Home and Excise Ministry has agreed to give the NCP a softening of the stance, but the matter is still stuck on some other important ministries
 mantriyon kii sankhya par bhi gatirodhcongress is baar gramin vikaas mantralay apane paas rakhana chaahati he, jo ki philhal ensipi ke paas he
 In return, the Congress has offered to give the Ministry of Environment and Forests, but the NCP wants an important department like the Urban Development Ministry in return for rural development
 maamla is baat par bhi atka he ki kiske khate main mantriyon ke kitne pad jaaenge
 The Congress, which won 20 seats more than the previous in this assembly election, is not ready to follow the 1999 formula
 khinchataan jari rahane ke asaaracongress auki ensipi ke tevar ko dekhte hue lagata nahin ki cabinet ke bantwaare kaa maamla itani jaldi sulajhegaa
 In such a situation, it is possible that even after the swearing in of the Chief Minister, this tussle continues for some days
 yah pakistan se baatcheet kaa samay nahin he
 This is not a minor skirmish, it is an attack
 iske baad rakshaamantri eke antni ne to pakistan ko clin chit de diya
 His statement is different from the statement of the Ministry of Defense
 antni safai den or apane bayaan par maafee maangane
 Senior BJP leader LK Advani has said all these things
 antni ke bayaan par jo siyaasi nurakushti shuru hai he usamen adwani bhi kud aae hai
 After the attacks of Sushma Swaraj in the Lok Sabha and Venkaiah Naidu in the Rajya Sabha, Advani accused the Defense Minister of changing the statement and demanded an apology
 adwani ne kaha, 'LOC par mangalvaar ko bhartiya sainikon par hua hamalaa jhadap nahin he, yah akraman he
 i believe that the time for talks with Pakistan is over
 'eke antni par hamalaa bolte adwani ne kaha, 'raksha mantralay or raksha mantri ke bayaan alag-alag hai
 The defense ministry's statement holds Pakistan and its military responsible for yesterday's incident
 saath hi aatankiyon ke bhi shaamil hone kii baat karata he
 But the statement of the Defense Minister attributes this to only the terrorists who were wearing the dress of the Pakistan Army at the time of the attack
 bayaan alag-alag hone se pakistan ko clinit mil rahi he
 'advani said,' i have spoken to Kamal Nathji
 sarkaar ko in donon bayanon par gaur karke sansad main safai deni chahie
 Antony should give clarification and apologize to the country
 'kya kaha tha rakshaamantri ne
 
 
 AK Antony, in his statement in Parliament, instead of directly blaming the Pakistani army, said that those involved in the attack were in the uniform of the Pakistani army
 sansad main mangalvaar ko antni ke bhaashan ke baad se hi ye sawaal uth rahe hai ki unhone hamalaavaron kaa zikr 'pakistani sena kii uniform main log' ke rup main kyon kiya? sansad main bijepi ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki hamane khud pakistan ko batch nikalne kaa rasta de diya he

 loksabhaa chunaavon ko maddenzar rakhte hue press club of india, nai dilli main papular front aaf india dwaara muslim raajnneetik sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The meeting was attended by scholars, intellectuals and community leaders from various states and various political and social plains and after taking stock of the current political situation and discussing the problems facing the country, decided to bring the problems of minorities, especially Muslims, to light took
 sabha ke ant main maangon kaa ek charter bhi paas kiya gaya jo muslim samudaay ke vikaas, pratinidhitiv, shiksha, samskruti, suraksha va anya samasyaon par aadhaarit he
 The Charter raised many such problems as the Babri Masjid, representation, anti-people laws, etc
, in which the opposition parties either appear to support the communal and casteist ideology of the BJP or they deliberately take silence on it
 sabha main paarit charter main is ore ishaara kiya gaya ki aresas kii maatahat bijepi ke netritv vaali maujuuda endie sarkaar main dharmik alpsankhyakon ko bahut zyaada nishaanaa banaaya gaya he or unke saath bhedbhaav se kaam liya gaya he
 The politics of hate has been the policy of the current government, rather than the politics of justice
 isliye aane vaale chunaav main is sarkaar ko badalanaa dharmik alpsankhyakon ke haq main hoga
 But at the same time it should be noted that the problems of survival and development of minorities have been ignored by non-bjp parties too, which have been dependent on the vote of traditional Muslims
 isliye keval shaasha dal yaa gathbandhan ko hataakar uski jagah dusron ko bithaana or sarkari palisiyon main koi badlaav na karnaa sahi vikalp nahin he
 In order to become a better alternative to the BJP, non-bjp parties will have to change their policies so far from the Awami policy and adopt a secular approach to various problems
 sabha ki adhyakshata kar rahe chairman i
 Abubakar emphasized that now is the time for the aggrieved classes to worry about ensuring their fair share of power, rather than being the voters of different parties
 unhone kaha ki janata vishesh rup se muslim alpsankhyak samudaay kii sulagati samasyaon par 25 khandon ke tahat kul 73 maangon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, jo buniyadi rup se sachhar cameti or mishra kamishan kii siforeeshon, alpsankhyak kalyaan yojanaon, kushal mazdoor or karigar, damankaaree kanoon, enarasi or naagarikta sanshodhan kaarywahiyon, farji ancounter, vichaaradhin kaidi, aabaadi ke hisaab se pratinidhitiv, dharmik alpsankhyakon ko aarakshan, alpsankhyak sansthaanon, muslim personal laa, ibaadatgahon, vakf, mahila shashaktikaran aadi par aadhaarit hai
 National Secretary Dr
 Taslim Rehmani told NDTV that the role of Muslims in the elections is just that in every upcoming election they have to seat one party and remove the other from the chair
 lekin koi bhi party unki samasyaon ke hal se matlab nahin rakhti
 Now the responsibility of defeating the BJP has been put on the shoulders of Muslims only and only on behalf of the residents of the scattered house of secular parties

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to snatch his old slogan 'main Nahin Hum' from Congress
 buudhvaar ko piem 'main nahin ham' portal or ap laanch karenge
 Whereas in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had given the slogan 'main Nahin Hum' against Narendra Modi

 is dauraan stage par ek bada poster bhi laga tha jisapar yah naaraa likhaa tha
 Apart from this, many charts and posters were also put up for teamwork
 yahi vajah thi congress ne jab 2014 main is naare kaa istemaal kiya tha
 At that time, the BJP accused the Congress of advertising piracy
 haalanki is naare ke narendra modi dobaaraa se apnaane ja rahe hai
 They have resorted to the app this time

 Those who applied for the new selectors include former wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia, Sameer Dighe and Vijay Dahiya, former fast bowlers Venkatesh Prasad, Abe Kuruvilla and Amit Bhandari
 purv spinner neelesh kulkarni, gyanendra pandey or ashish kapur ne bhi is pad ke liye aavedan die hai
 The new selection committee will be special in many ways
 board ne chayankartaaon ke liye kuch sharten rakhi hai, masalan aavedak ne van-de, test match main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv yaa kam se kam 50 pratham shrenee maichon main bhagidaari kii ho, pratham shrenee match khilne waalon ke naam junior rashtriya chayan samiti ke liye rakhe jaaenge
 The age of selectors must be below 60 years

 In this race, the claim of Mongia and Venkatesh Prasad seems strong
