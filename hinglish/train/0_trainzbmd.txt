 netaaon ko anterrashtriya politics kii samaj ke liye di salaahbataya ja rahaa he gerald ne siem akhilesh ko salaah di he ki ve apni party ke netaaon ko international politics kii samaj badhaane ke liye prerit karen
 Let me tell you here that CM Akhileshki met Austin during his visit to London
 america ke chaar-chaar presidents kaa chunavi campan safaltaapurvak sambhaal chuke austin ke bare main siem ne bhi puri jaankaree juta rakhi he
 Gerald Austin, election consultant for the Democrat Party of America, has been planning the party for presidential elections since 1968
 ve chaar america raashtrapati jimi carter, bill clinton ke saath-saath baraak obama ke chunaav campan ko puri tarah se kaamyaab bana chuke hai
 Chief Minister Akhilesh and Austin both spoke in detail on sp's public relations and image building, according to the content of Chief Minister Austin's work
 mukhyamantri bhi austin ke kaam se kaaphi santusht hai
 He has also expressed his desire to hire Austin
 gerald ko sapa ke campaning ke tareeke bare main acchhee tarah se maaloom he
 He has thoroughly tested the sp's campaigning methods in 2012
 samaajawaadee party ke yuva netaa unke trek record se kaaphi parichit hai or ve america chunaavon main unki bhoomika ke bare main bakhubi jaanate hai
 Maybe he can train the political advisors and supporters of the SP party
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi hair kii thi piaar agencyloksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan media main ai khabaron ke mutabik, bijepi ke piem pad ke daavedaar narendra modi ne apni image building ke liye kai alag-alag agenciyon kaa sahaara liya tha
 These included separate agencies for international branding, separate firms for social branding and separate firms for local branding
 modi kii videsh or desh main branding kaa jimmaa do america piaar form episio worldwide or mutual piaar ke paas tha
 Both these firms used to make news and opinion in favor of Modi in India and abroad
 obama or putin kii bhi image banaai piaar agency namerica akhabar neuyork times mutabik, rus ke president vladimir putin ne apni branding or piaar kaa kaam america form kaicham ko de rakhaa he
 The same firm also used to do the image building of former US President George Bush
 company kii solid branding or lobing ke chalate hi putin ko 2007 main time megsine se person of da year kaa award mila tha
 Interestingly, this PR agency has been working for Putin's image building since 2006
 saal 2013 ke shuruaati 6 maheenon main is agency ne bataur fees 13 karod rupye liye the
 At the same time, between 2006 and 2012 this amount was more than 200 crores
 vaise to america raashtrapati baraak obama dwaara lee ja rahi piaar fermo kii sarvice ke bare main america media ko zyada jaankaree nahin he, lekin unhone apane faislon or khud ko janata ke bich sahi sabit karne ke liye kai baar alag-alag piaar agenciyon kaa sahaara liya he
 What works PR agencies CPR companies do the work of branding and image building to positive the negative image of leaders
 piaar companiyaan janata yaa torget audiyans ke man main kisi bhi party kiskaratmak imejabanane main sakasham hoti hai phir chaahe janata us party yaa vyakti se naaraaz hi kyon na hon
 However, this formula which gets hit most of the time also fails many times
 piaar form jab bhi kisi political party yaa netaa kii branding kaa kaam karti hai, to unka sabase zyada dhyaan torget audiyans ko prabhavit karne vaale logon or chizon par hota he
 Agencies are the first to select influential people with a serious image among the youth voters
 company kii ore se aksar ye dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki ye log raajnneetik na hon or unka thodaa-bahut jhukaav party kii ore ho
 After selecting influential people from different sections of society, the task of indirectly praising the client (who needs to be branded) or improve their image in articles, bytes and public events
 in sabake bich soshal cites, media management, spich riting, press relies menagement, public event karana, web blog or anya jagahon par bhi client kii image building kaa kaam jari rahata he
 As the general elections are getting closer, the war of the leaders is intensifying

 bjp's star campaigner and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, at a rally in Goa, termed Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi a 'fish fish small fish'
 jawaab main congress ne modi ko 'maanavbhakshi piranha machhlee' kah daalaa
 At Margao rally near Panaji, Modi directly targeted Rahul
 gujarat main yuvak congress ko majboot karne kii rahul kii muhim par modi ne kaha, 'congress main yuva aise hai jaise machhleeghar kii choti machhliyaan
 Congress does not see youth in slums and poor families
 ' rahul gandhi ko congress kii ore se piem pad kaa ummidavaar bataae jane par unhone kaha, 'congress main yuva apane pita ke prabhaav ke aadhaar par raajnneeti main aate hai
 Modi said that youth of bjp's youth unit are ready to face challenges
 modi goa main party pratyaashiyon narendra savaikar or shripad nik ke prachaar ke liye pahunche the
 The Congress immediately took an aggressive stand on this statement of Modi
 dilli main congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki agar narendra modi ko yuva congressi 'choti machhliyaan' lagate hai to vah khud 'piranha machhlee' hai
 Without referring to the Gujarat riots, Tiwari said that Modi is like a piranha fish that eats humans too
 ullekhneey he ki rahul gandhi philhal do divasiy gujarat yatra par hai
 This is his third Gujarat tour in recent times

 gandhi hatya main sangh kii bhoomika ko lekar patel kii soch rahi virodhabhasipahale unhone kaha tha ki gandhi hatya main sangh ke haath khun se sane hambad main unhone kaha ki gandhi hatya main sangh kii koi sidhi bhoomika nahinloh purush sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii aaj desh bhar main jayanti manaai ja rahi he
 What was the role of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi? What did the then Home Minister Sardar Patel think about this, which some people have been trying to make him a bigger hero than Nehru
 is bare main kai kitabon or sroton se hasil jaankaree se yah badi chaunkaane vaali baat pataa chalati he ki swayan sardaar patel kaa is maamle main rukh virodhabhasi rahaa he
 Actually, Patel's thinking about the role of RSS in the Gandhi assassination was also shown to change according to the circumstances
 ek samay to gusse main aakar unhone kah diya ki gandhi hatya main sangh ke logon ke haath khun se sane hai
 However, he later admits that the Sangh does not play a role in the Gandhi assassination, but is the hand of some staunch leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha
 pehle kaha- gandhi hatya main sangh ke haath khun se sane hai30 janvari, 1948 ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya kar di gai
 Subsequently, on 4 February 1948, the RSS was banned nationwide
 9 farvari, 1948 ko sardaar patel ne punjab ke siem gopichand bhargav ko patr likhaa, ‘main is baat ko lekar chintit hum ki aresas ke log amritsar main juluus nikaal rahe hai
 Shouting slogans and violating government orders in general
 jahaan tak main jaanata hum pratibandh lagane ke baad se bharat main kisi bhi duusari jagah par aisa kuch nahin hua he, puure bharat main aresas par pratibandh ko logon ne hathohath liya he, balki aresas ke khilaaf bhaawanaaon main janata kaa rukh sarkaar se kahin zyada sakht he
 Therefore, it is a matter of surprise that in Amritsar how can someone do such a thing
 'ise bhi padhein: sardaar patel ne anuchhed 370 ko bataaya tha jaruri! jaane kya thi unki bhoomikounhone likhaa, 'ham bharat main pehle hi aresas or iske samoohon se bahut sari museebataan jhel chuke hai
 Therefore, i believe that your government will make it clear through its action that anyone sympathetic to the RSS will be a part of the government's tough steps and resentment
 in logon ke haath mahatma gandhi ke khun se sane hai, isliye unke pavitra vaade or in vaadon se hatana ab koi myne nahin rakhata
 You must have seen that the Government of India showed no hesitation in taking action against organizations associated with the RSS
 'phir mana-gandhi hatya ke liye sangh nahin hindu mahasabha ke kuch kattar netaa jimmedaarnehru ko 27 farvari, 1948 ko likhe apane patr main sardaar patel kehete hai, ‘main baapu kii hatya ke maamle main chal rahi jaanch-padtaal kii pragati ke lagbhag dainik sampark main rahata hum
 It is also clear from these statements that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was not involved in this conspiracy
 saavarkar ke sidhe maargdarshan main hindu mahasabha ke ek kattar varg ne yah shadyantra rachaa
 Pushed him forward and led to the end result
 yah bhi dikhaai detaa he ki yah shadyantra 10 aadamiyon tak simit tha, jinamein se do ko chhodkar sab pakad liye gaye hai
 Most of these things were directed towards the tendencies of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh people in various centers
 hamane is sambandh main jaanch jari rakhi or in aaropon ke sivaay ki gandhiji kii mrity par mithaiyaan banti gayi yaa harsh prakat kiya gaya tha, shaayad hi koi thos or mahatvapurn baat pai gai
 'he wrote,' After discussing these things in detail, i have come to the decision that the conspiracy to kill Bapu was not as widespread as it is generally believed, but it was limited to a handful of men who were quite long Bapu has been an enemy since time
 yah dushmani theth us samay se bataai jaati he, jab baapu jinna se baatcheet karne gaye the
 At that time Godse fasted in protest and other conspirators went to Wardha to prevent Bapu from going near Jinnah
 beshak baapu kii hatya kaa aresas tathaa hindu mahasabha main aise logon ne swaagat kiya tha, jo baapu kii vichaardhaara or niti ke kattar virdohi the, parantu isse aage praapt pramaan ke aadhaar par aresas yaa hindu mahasabha ke kinhin anya sadasyon ko is shadyantra ke saath joda nahin ja saktaa
 Of course the RSS has to answer for its other sins and crimes, but not for this
 'sangh kii gatividhiyon ko desh ke liye bataaya tha khatrasardaar patel ne 18 july, 1948 ko shyama prasad mukherjee ko ek chitthee bheji thi
 This letter is very famous
 unhone likhaa, ‘gandhi ji kii hatya kaa cese abhi court main he
 That is why the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha, i would not say anything about joining these two organizations
 lekin hamaari reports main is baat kii pushti hoti he ki jo hua, wo in donon sanghathanon kii gatividhiyon kaa nateeja he
 Especially of RSS
 desh main is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya gaya ki is tarah kii (gandhi kii hatya) bhayanak ghatana mumkin ho pai
 There is no doubt in my mind that the hardline faction of the Hindu Mahasabha was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi
 aresas kii gatividhiyon ke kaaran bharat sarkaar or is desh ke astitv par sidhaa-sidhaa khatra paidaa hua
 'so these letters prove that Sardar Patel did not consider the policies of the RSS in the interest of the country, but he was not quite sure that the RSS had any direct role in Gandhi's assassination
 isaki vajah yah he ki jaanch main is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin mil paaya tha or desh ke grih mantri hone ke naate unhen in sabaki jaankaree thi

 Unique idol, unique method of worship and different offerings of devotees on it
 ujjain ke akhand jyoti mandir main bhakton ko hanuman kaa chamatkaar dikhaai detaa he
 While on one side, seeing the unbroken flame burning in the temple, one can get rid of half a century by burning a lamp of flour, while for other wishes devotees offer different offerings to Bajrangbali
 anokhi rasm he, bajrangbali ke darbar main guhaar lagane kaa rivaaj bhi anokhaa he
 With endless faith, devotees beg Pawanputra
 yahaan pavanputra sunate hai apane bhakton kii pukaar or bhakton kaa kalyaan karte hai
 From the idol of Bajrangbali in the Mahakala city of Ujjain to the Akhand Jyoti temple, the point of worship here is unique
 jahaan ek taraf bajrangbali kii sinduri pratimaa bhakton ko apni ore aakarshith karti he to vahiin duusari ore unke paanv ke neeche dabi lankini rakshasi unke parakram kii kahani sunaati he
 It is said that when Hanuman was coming with Sanjeevani to save Lakshmana, a demon named Lankini stopped him from blocking his path, after which Hanuman proceeded to press Lankini under his feet
 is mandir main mahavir ke usee rup ke darshan hote hai jahaan aaj bhi hanuman ke pairon tale lankini virajman he
 This form of Bal Brahmachari with complete grooming is very attractive
 dakshinamukhi hanuman kii is pratimaa main unke ek haath main sanjivani to kandhe par gada sushobhit hoti he
 All the sufferings of the devotees are overcome by mere sight of Mahavir's divine form, wearing armlets in his hands, pajeb in the feet and wearing tight in the wrist
 mandir ke naam ke anuroop hi yahaan jalataa akhand diya bhakton ko bajrambali ke chamatkaar kii kahani sunaata he
 You see that this temple is like other temples of Hanuman, but the temple has contained the miraculous powers of Bajrangbali in the unbroken lamp lit for years
 kehete hai sadhesati se pareshaan bhakt agar is mandir main aakar is akhand diye ke darshan kar len or mandir main aate kaa ek diya jala den to shani ke prakope se mukti milte der nahin lagati
 Devotees offer many types of offerings to Hanuman ji here
 kehete hai bhakt yahaan apni manokamana prasad ke madhyam se lekar aate hai
 If one needs to get rid of quarrels, misdeeds, then by offering only one coconut, all his sufferings are eliminated
 thik usee tarah jin bhakton ko santan kii kaamana he wo apni shakti or bhakthi ke anusaar 1, 2 yaa 5 kilo tel akhand jyoti main chadhaane kaa sankalp lete hai
 Hanuman, who is pleased with gram-chironji, is offered special offerings of rot
 kehete hai jin bhakton kii mannath puri hoti he wo yahaan aakar aate main gud milakar rot kaa prasad taiyaar karte hai or bajrangbali ko bhoga lagaate hai
 Devotees throng in large numbers to witness the daily aarti in the temple
 kehete hai bal, vidya or buddhi kaa vardaan paane ke liye yahaan hanuman ke sang unki daayin ore rakhi hui chandan kii gada ke darshan karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Worshiping on Tuesday and Saturday has special significance
 desh ke kone-kone se bhakt yahaan aakar hanuman ji kaa aashirwad pate hai or khushiyon ko apane saath samet kar le jate hai
 After abolishing the two sections of Article 370 and dividing the state into two parts, the government is now preparing to provide a package of Rs 1 lakh crore for the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself can announce it
 hindustan times ne sutron ke hawaale se yah khabar di he
 Significantly, the state of Jammu and Kashmir's economy is worse and the government believes that the state could not develop due to Article 370
 sansad main is bare main charchaa karte hue kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne kaha tha ki ab sarkaar kii agali praathamikta jammu or kashmir kaa vikaas ho sakati he
 The goal of this economic package will be that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh be integrated as much as possible with main India
 iske pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 7 november, 2015 ko kashmir ke vikaas ke liye ek vikaas agenda ghoshit kiya tha
 Only then did PM Modi promise to invest Rs 80,068 crore for the development of the state, but two-thirds of it is yet to be spent
 isaki vajah yah he ki pariyojnaon kaa sahi dhang se kriyanvayan nahin ho paaya
 According to officials, the Modi government has an ambitious vision to make Kashmir on the Indian subcontinent like Switzerland
 iske liye kashmir ke paryaton, bagwani, resham paalan, food processing aadi sector kii sambhaavnaaon kaa dohan kiya jayega
 Apart from this, handicrafts and other less polluting industries will also be developed in Kashmir
 iske alaava centre sarkaar saarvajanik companiyon se bhi in ilaakon main nivesh karne ko kah sakati he
 According to Uday Kotak, the Nominee Chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the strong efforts of the government and industry will help in increasing the growth rate and employment opportunities in the state
 rajya main panbizli pariyojnaon or saura urja ke vikaas kaa bhi kaaphi avasar he

 rajya main pichley paanch saal main 10 fisadi kii vikaas dar dekhi gai he, lekin yah base rate kaaphi kam hone kii vajah se he
 The economy of the state is dependent on farming and services
 rajya ke pramukh udyogon main paryaton, hastshilp, resham utpaadan, handloom, bagbani, food processing or krishi he
 However, the state's economic survey shows that gross state domestic product is just 0
 9 fisadi udyogon par kharch kiya jaataa he
 The manufacturing activity of the state is limited to only agricultural products and handicrafts

 Pilot went on to say that there is no such provision in any other state that without elected people can contest elections for the post of Mayor and Chairman

 Satish Pooniyan said, 'the government was planning to hold people in bodies on the basis of its favorite people, spoon and money power, behind the introduction of hybrid model, but today due to public pressure, the government took its decision The people of the state have won with the u turn
 'dow punia ne kaha, 'sarkaar nikaay chunaavon ko jeetne ke liye chaahe kitni hi tikadam laga len lekin pichley 10 maah main sarkaar kii vifaltaa, bigadati kanoon vyavastha, safai, bijli, pani, sadak kaaryon par sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa jo virodh he vah sarkaar kii haar kaa bada kaaran rahegaa

 It was the day of Holi and we all played Holi fiercely, well it is not a big deal, we always play Holi fiercely
 wo saal 2010 kii holi thi or holi ke rang kaa asli matlab to usee holi main samaj main aayaa tha
 Now the question arises here that we did not understand the true meaning of the color of Holi till now, if it is answered honestly, it will be 'no'
 kyonki us din pehali baar maine mohammad umr ko holi khelte dekha tha
 After playing Holi, i was sitting at home in the leisure moments and our uncle had to go somewhere, so i said let's go too
 unhen apane dhabas ke liye chikan lenaa tha so dilli ke kalyaan puri main ek chikan kii dukaan par pahunch gaye
 Right now the chicken was being weighed that the voice came from the first floor on the same shop, 'mohammad Omar
 
 
 are mohammad umr, ghar aajaa
 'on hearing this, my first sight went to the mother who was calling her son home and the other side was Mohammad Omar
 umr ko dekhakar man khush ho gaya, kyonki haath main pichakaari liye, laal-pilaa cheharaa or doston ke peeche rang lagane ke liye bhaagta phir rahe ladke kaa naam tha umr
 i do not know the age of Omar, but i could have guessed that he must have been 6-7 years old
 isi khushi main ab ek baar phir meri najar uski maa kii taraf gai, lekin un par holi kaa koi asar nahin tha
 The same was the case with the chicken selling chicken, who would presumably be Mohammed Omar's father
 uski maa ke saath ek or yuva ladki khadi thi, us par bhi holi kaa koi nishaan nahin tha
 Overall Mohammed Omar was the one who played Holi throughout the house
 umr khush bhi bahut tha, ho bhi kyon nahin
 
 
 Who does not like to get drenched in colors like this with my friends? baat majahab kii nahin he, baat he hamaari samaj kii
 As we grow older, we also become mindless
 ho saktaa he bachapan main mohammad umr ke pita ne bhi holi kheli ho or maa bhi holi ke rangon main rangi ho
 But as they became sensible in the eyes of worldliness, the world snatched the colors of Holi from their lives and painted them in the colors of religion
 kya aapako yaad he kaise ham log bachapan main milakar rangon main sarabor hua karte the or id par doston ke ghar jaakar senwaiyon kaa majaa lete the
 Now we are not able to enjoy the festivals of other religions, because now we have become 'sensible' and humanity has gone away from us
 isliye aaj dil karata he ki kyonki nahin ham hameshaa mohammad umr hi bane rahete
 Jagjit Singh remembers a ghazal on this matter - 'take this wealth too, take this fame, take away my youth from me
 magar mujhako lautaa do wo bachapan kaa sawan, wo kaagaj kii kashti wo barish kaa pani
 Mohammad Omar, always maintain that innocence, you may grow up with the body, but never grow bigger than the mind and heart
 kyonki jis din tum dil-dimag se bade ho jaaoge, us din ye duniyaavaale tumhaari jindagi se bhi holi ke rang chin lenge

 unhone kaha, ‘kohli kii pravriti alag he, main ise samajhataa hum lekin har koi use dekhtaa he
 It is good to be aggressive but it has to be aggressive from the inside

 If he reduces aggression a little, it will be good for him
 ’yuva team ne lagaataar teen toornament champiens trophy, westeindies main vanade siries or zimbabwe main vanade shrinkhalaa jeet liye hai
 Azhar feels that it is difficult for the senior players to return to the national team, who are currently out of the team
 ajahar ne kaha, ‘senior khilaadiyon ke liye vaapasi karnaa bahut mushkil he, yuva team acha pradarshan kar rahi he
 So unless a player is injured, it will be difficult for any player to return
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin ve bharat ke liye kai varshon se khel rahe hai, ve anbhavi khilaadi hai
 They have to perform well in the domestic tournament
 agar ve acha karte hai to vaapasi kar sakate hai

 com / 34e7dzieow— Scott Styris (@scottbstyris) January 26, 2019 Let us know that New Zealand's performance in the last two odis has been very poor
 nepier main kiwi team ko 8 wicket se haar mili to mount maaunganui main unhen 90 ranon se sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 No batsman of the team is seen in rhythm
 bharat agar kal jeet ke saath 3-0 kii vijayi badhat hasil kar letaa he to yah 2014 main newjiland main hui simit overon kii siries main haar kaa badla hoga jab team india ne siries 0-4 se ganvaai thi
 Satyavrat Chaturvedi, senior Congress leader and chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee, which is considering the Lokpal Bill, has said that legislation to control corruption can be helpful, but it cannot play a decisive role in ending it
 madhyapradesh redcrass sosayadi ke ek kaarykram main shaamil hone ke baad anaupchaarik baatcheet main chaturvedi ne kaha, ‘kisi saamaajik dosha ko dur karne main kanoon sahaayak to ho saktaa he, lekin nirnaayak nahin ho saktaa he’unase poocha gaya tha ki unki najar main bhrashtachar mitaane main lokapal kitna madadgaar hoga
 He said that to remove social defects like corruption, the society needs to change itself and there is a need to take tough initiatives at the social level
 unhone saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare evam baba ramdev kaa naam liye bina kaha ki lokapal kanoon banane tak maang uchit he, lekin jab sansad main isaki prakriya chal rahi he, to andolan karne kaa auchity nahin he
 The law has to be made in Parliament itself, it cannot be made by agitating at Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan
 lokapal vidheyak par vichaar kar rahi sansadeey pravar samiti kab tak apni report rajyasabha main pesh kar degi, is sawaal par chaturvedi ne kaha ki samiti vibhinn raajnneetik dalon, samaaj ke vibhinn virgo se vichaar or suzav le rahi he, sabhi pakshon ko sunanaa ek lambii prakriya he, isliye nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki vah kab tak apni report pesh karegi
 The committee intends to complete this work as soon as possible
 pravar samiti kanoonee evam sanvaidhanik visheshgyon se baat karegi or saarvajanik madhyamon se aam janata se suzav evam paraamarsh mangaaye jane kii soochna jari kii gai he
 In response to another question, the committee chairman said that Parliamentary Select cannot put any pressure on the committee, it works only under the constitution and parliamentary procedure
 unase poocha gaya tha ki kya lokapal vidheyak ko lekar anna hajaare evam baba ramdev ke andolan kaa vah koi dabaav mahasoos kar rahi he
 He said that it is everyone's right to fast and agitate in democracy, but the work which is pending in Parliament, then there is no solution to the movement
 team anna dwaara raajnneetik dal gathit karne sambandhi elaan ko lekar poochne par unhone kaha ki unka yah iraadaa to pehle bhi jaahir tha, ghoshnaa unhone ab kii he
 There are more than fifty political parties in the country and the Congress has been fighting elections against them all
 ab ek or raajnneetik dal banane se kya fark padane vaala he, kyonki hamaara samvidhan har naagarik ko chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar detaa he
 On the question of factionalism within the party in Madhya Pradesh, a senior Congress leader said that it is necessary for all the partymen to make concerted efforts for a political fight with the ruling BJP

 In Uttar Pradesh's Hamirpur district, a case of meeting a minor girl has been reported
 jahaan ghar se baahar gai ladki ko ek yuvak ne agava kar liya or phir sunsaan jagah par le jaakar uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 This incident of rape is in the Chicasi police station area of hamirpur
 jile ke apper police adheekshak laal sahab yadav ne is sambandh main jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki shanivaar ko chikasi thana kshetra main gaanv kii 15 varshiyaldakikhule main shouch ke liye ghar se baahar akele gai thi
 There was already a young man named Pappu where the girl went
 jisane ladki ko balpurvak agava kar liya or use ek khandharnuma sunsaan jagah par le gaya
 The accused raped the girl there
 ghatana ke baad usne ladki ko dhamkee dete hue kaha ki agar usne is bare main kisi ko bataaya to wo use jaan se maar degaa
 After the incident, the victim reached her home in a bad condition and heard the family members
 uski baat sunakar gharavaale sakate main aa gaye
 They reached the police station directly with the girl
 eespi ke mutabik thana police ne peedita kii shikaayat parrepaka mukadmaa darj kar aaropee yuvak pappu ko giraftaar kar liya
 The victim has been sent to a government hospital for medical treatment

 His film '3 The Bhai', released on Friday, starred actors like Om Puri, Shreyas Talpade and Deepak Dobriyal
 film '3 the bhai' aise bhaaiyon par he jo ek-duusare se nafrat karte hai
 First brother Chixi who runs a small shop
 doosraa bhai happy karj kaa maaraa dentist or teesraa maamuli actor jis par hollywood kaa nasha haaavee he
 These brothers living separately are stricken with their lives, but one day the three brothers find out that their late grandfather has left property worth crores
 vasiyat ke mutabik jise paane kii ek hi shart he
 Celebrating Grandpa's anniversary for three years on a snowy hill together
 bas yaheen kahani aakar khatm ho jaati he
 After this, the three brothers are seen fighting in the whole fight
 ek- duusare par jhapatane kudane giraane or khari khoti kii ye marathon khatm hi nahin hoti
 Looks like there was an attempt to make a cartoon film like Tom and Jerry about Live Artist, but i doubt that children will laugh even after watching it
 band kamare main shoot kiye lambey-lambey seens dekhakar lagata he jaise film nahin koi naatak khelaa ja rahaa ho
 Director Mrigdeep Singh Lamba was wasted by the talent of well-known artists like Ompuri, Shreyas Talpade and Deepak Dobriyal
 bahut acha concept tha
 The story of the three brothers could have a lot of emotional appeal
 khaskar jab daler mehandi kii awaz main acha tital sang pehle hi aa chukaa tha
 Deepak Dobriyal and Ragini Khanna's little love story definitely touches the heart
 kaash ise badhaayaa jaataa
 Shreyas Talpade called for some good dialogues
 kuch seens dekhakar muskuraahat bhi tair jaati he
 It is regrettable that filmmakers like Teen Bhai Rakesh Mehra have produced
 phir bhi man main ek hi santosh he ki chalo ye sirf teen hi bhai the zyada hote to hamaara kya hota
 My rating for the film is 1
 5 star
 Narendra Modi, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, threw political heat in the air of UP, attacking all the rival parties including Congress
 modi ne kanpur kii raily main garibi, mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise muddon ke jariye aam logon kaa dil chune or voton kii khatir man tatolane kii koshish kii
 'congress has been lying for 60 years' Narendra Modi lashed out at the UPA government with political arrows
 unhone kaha ki congress desh ko bevakoof bana rahi he
 He said that the Congress had promised to bring down inflation in 100 days, but it promised
 unhone kaha ki jinhone vaadakhilaphi kii he, uskaa hisaab-chuktaa janata chuktaa karegi
 Holding the Congress responsible for poverty, Modi said, 'congress has made a situation that the homes of the poor of the country are not burning stoves, the father cries, the mothers cry, the children are sleeping with tears
 congress kaa ahankaar saatven aasmaan par he, use janata kii parvaah nahin he
 See the language of Congress leaders
 
 
 rahul gandhi par kataaksh karte hue modi ne kaha, 'shahjade kehete hai ki garibi kuch nahin hoti, yah to keval man kii avasthaa hoti he
 Do those who are born with gold spoon know what poverty is? i have known the pain of poverty
 wo bheed lekar garibi dekhne jate hai, hamane garibi ko jiya he, hamaari paidaaish garibi main hui
 "is food available for 12 rupees?" Marking the Planning Commission, Modi said, "he says that earning 26 rupees in the village and 31 rupees in the city is not poor
" jinaki soch hi aisi he, wo kya garib kaa bhala karenge? garibon ke ghaav par namak chhidaka ja rahaa he
 Modi said that the food security bill is being talked about today, but the law has been made to give less grains to the elders than the amount of food grains being given to children in the mid-day meal
 ye logon ko bhookha rakhane kaa bill he
 He said that such people should be evicted from power, then they will know what is the hunger of the poor
 manmohan or sonia par sidhaa praharmodi ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri mahangaai ke masale par nahin bolte hai
 Sonia never talked about inflation
 main poochta hum ki jinako aapaki parvaah nahin he, kya aapako unki parvaah kerani chahie? in logon ko bevafaayee kii aisi sajaa dijie ki saalon-saal aise logon kii vaadakhilaphi karne kii himmat naa ho
 'also mentioned the coal scam, while referring to the coal scam, Narendra Modi said,' The files of the coal scam have not only been lost, but the entire government has been lost
 sarkaar ne filein nahin, hamaari life kho di he
 The pollution in Kanpur is of coal ash in Delhi
 hamaare gaanv, hamaare garib, hamaare kisaan, congress ke liye yah sirf majaak kaa vishay he
 Lashing out at SP and BSP, Modi also lashed out at SP and BSP, saying, "they speak something in Parliament and work to save the Congress government from behind the scenes
" aise log aapke uttar pradesh main bhi hai
 Such parties hide the sins of the Congress to hide their sins
 is desh kaa sankalp hona chahie ki na sirf congress, balki unke sahyogiyon ko bhi aane vaale chunaav main janata raajnneeti main neeche dhakel de
 He said that the slogan of Congress-free India should be raised
 upi kii kanoon-vyavastha par sawalmodi ne upi main badhate aparaadh ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said, “the law and order in UP has collapsed
 ek saal main 5000 se zyada nirdosh logon kii hatya ho gai, phir bhi upi sarkaar votbank kii raajnneeti karti he
 Efforts are also being made to release such people who are accused of terrorism
 'upi kaa rahaa he gauravshaalee itihasamodi ne kaha, 'is bhoomi ne 8 pradhanmantri die, yahaan se bade diggaj chunakar aate hai, phir bhi yahaan ke logon ko roji-roti ke liye saikadon mile dur gujarat aana padataa he
 If there was development in UP, there would not have been an escape
 ganga-yamuna-saraswati kii triveni puure hindustan ke logon kii aan, baan or shaan kaa vishay he
 For which UP was the center of the faith, in that same UP, a trio of SP, BSP and Congress took over the faith
 jab tak yah tikdi rahegi, tab tak aisa hi rahegaa, isliye is tikdi se mukti jaruri he
 In the midst of the popular Modi rally, Narendra Modi said, 'I have done meetings in elections before, i have come to Kanpur before and go to other areas of the country, but in this bright sun i see this human ocean 
 jahaan tak najar pahunch rahi he, mund hi mund he
 You will show strength in the election, but this rally in Kanpur has won me over
 'kanpur ke logon ke prati aabhaar jataate hue modi ne kaha, 'itani dhoop main bhi palak-paanvade bichhaakar apane jo pyaar diya he or jo swaagat kiya he, uske liye main aapkaa abhinandan karata hum
 The penance you are doing in the sun, i will not let it go waste
 main dekh saktaa hum ki desh ke kone-kone main jo pyaar umad rahaa he, us pyaar ke saath is desh ko tabah karne vaali congress or uske saathi dalon ke prati janata apane gusse ko bhi prakat kar rahi he
 Amid the slogans of "narendra Modi Zindabad", he told the people, "the cheer you bring brings a resolve to destroy those who destroy the country
" 'modi ne janata se sidhe-sidhe sawaal kiya, 'main aapse poochta hum, aaplogon ne jin kathinaaiyon main jindagi guzari he, kya aap apane bacchon ko bhi aisi hi jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor karnaa chaahate hai? aap apane bacchon kaa bhavishya badalanaa chaahate hai? unke bhagya ko sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai? agar aapako apane bacchon se pyaar he or aap unka bhavishya thik karnaa chaahate hai, to sankalp karen ki aapako jisane tabah kiya, use aap apane bacchon kaa bhavishya tabah nahin karne denge
 ' sansad ke central haal main shanivaar ko rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) kaa netaa chune jane ke baad kaaryvahak pradhanmantri narendra modi ko vahaan maujuud sabhi saansadon ne badhai di
 But one particular picture caught everyone's attention
 bhopal se bijepi ke tikat par chuni gayi sadhvi pragna singh thakur kii modi ne andekhi kii
 In fact, 2 days before the end of the Lok Sabha elections, Sadhvi Pragya, who described Nathuram Godse as a patriot, had troubled the party and due to this the BJP had to face all round criticism
 bhartiya janata party ke aadhikarik twitor acount se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bayaan jari kiya gaya
 He has said that whatever has been done about Mahatma Gandhi and Nathuram Godse, they are terrible
 ye baaten puri tarah se ghrinaa ke laayak hai, sabhy samaaj ke andar is prakaar kii baaten nahin chalati hai
 PM Modi said that even though he (sadhvi Pragya) has apologized in this matter, i will never be able to forgive him from my heart
 maalegaanv blast kii aaropee sadhvi pragna ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kaha tha ki nathuram godse deshbhakt the, hai or rahenge
 On which the Bharatiya Janata Party was embarrassed and the entire opposition took the BJP in the face
 kirakiri ke baad sadhvi pragna ne maafee maang lee thi, lekin tabatak vivaad gaharaa chukaa tha
 First came the statement of Amit Shah and then after that Narendra Modi gave the statement
 baharhaal, sadhvi pehle hi musiibat main funs chuki hai, jiske baad modi ko kahana padaa tha ki wo unhen dil se maaf nahin karenge
 Right now, the sword of bjp's disciplinary committee's action on Sadhvi Pragya Thakur also hangs, in such a situation, ignoring Modi for Sadhvi is important
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri jagadish shettar ne bies yediurppa dwaara bhaajapa chhodane ko ‘durbhagyapurna’ qaraar diya
 He said, 'it is unfortunate that former Chief Minister Yeddyurappa left the BJP and formed his own party
 main yediurppa ko unke naye prayaas ke liye shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 Yeddyurappa resigned from the primary membership of the party by sending a letter to BJP President Nitin Gadkari

 According to a complaint lodged by Colombo Police on 14 January by Foreign Minister Mangal Samaraweera, the aim was to disrupt the counting of votes and declare emergency
 khabaron ke mutabik, unki koshish naakaam rahi, kyonki sena ne sahyog karne se inkaar kar diya
 a few hours later, the President left his Temple Trees residence, accepting defeat in front of friend-turned-enemy Maitripal Sirisena
 pichley november main jab unki lokapriyata girani shuru hui thi, tab bhi unhen aparaajey mana ja rahaa tha
 There was weak and divided opposition in front of them
 srilanka main satta ke sabhi pramukh padon par unka hi parivaar kabiz tha
 The 69-year-old Rajaphane, who ruled Sri Lanka for nearly a decade, secured approval on the disputed amendment of 2010 by resorting to a weak Supreme Court, allowing him to contest the presidential election for the third time
 8 janvari ke chunaav nirdhaarit samay se do saal pehle hi kara liye gaye
 The political storm, which was cleverly kept secret by former Rajapaksa leader and later adversary Chandrika Kumaratunga, exposed an unexpected opponent
 rajpakshe ke purv swasthya mantri sirisena ne sabhi ko chaunkaate hue 9 janvari ko rajpakshe ko maat de di
 Announcing his candidacy on 21 November, Sirisena said, "the entire economy and every aspect of society is occupied by only one family
" ”isse thik ek din pehle raat ko unhone colombo main temple tries nivas par chaaval se bane idiappam or sambar kii daavat udayi thi
 His opponent, Rajapaksa, said, "I ate Idiapam at night and stabbed me in the back

 But Sirisena was not the only candidate to throw him this way
 may 2009 main tamil tigron ko kuchalane ke kuch maheene baad 2010 main rajpakshe jab lokapriyata ke charam par the, to unhone raashtrapati chunaav kara liye
 Then he had the commander of the army, General Sharat Fonseka, who led the army in the last few years of the war

 Angered by him, the president jailed him on minor charges and arrested his close aides
 bahuton kaa maananaa he ki badale kii is karrwai ke baad se hi raashtrapati kii lokapriyata ghatni shuru ho gai thi
 He lost the support of professionals, intellectuals and the middle class
 jab nae-nae rajmarg ban gaye or colombo main buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan kaa kaam bad gaya to rajpakshe ne satta par apni pakad majboot kar lee
 He started intimidating his political opponents and the media — many journalists fled the country
 virodhiyon ke phone tap kiye jane lage
 It is alleged that he allowed his family and close friends to make big money through heavy commissions, especially through Chinese contracts
 srilanka kaa madhya varg is tarah ke bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se naaraaz ho gaya lekin gramin kshetron main rajpakshe kaa janaadhar majboot bana rahaa
 Political observers believe that his attempt to become president for the third time was aimed at paving the way for his 28-year-old son, Namal, to contest the election in 2021 after completing his fixed age of 35 years

 The group started attacks on Muslims and churches
 unki mukhya shikaayat yah thi ki colombo main muslim aabaadi baudhon ke mukaable teji se bad rahi thi
 In June last year, dozens of BBS Buddhist monks and their supporters allegedly attacked the Muslim-dominated city of Beruwala, killing three people
 muslim rajnatikon, jin par rajpakshe apni sarkaar main samarthan ke liye nirbhar the, ne joardaar virodh kiya or karrwai karne kii maang kii
 But no arrests were made

 Not only this, in January 2013, Rajapaksa was displeased with a decision against him and sacked Chief Justice Shirani Bhandarnayake, after which a new movement of civil society started
 ek pratishthit buddha sanyasi maduloluve sobitha ne pichley saal civil socity ke vibhinn virgon ko jodate hue saamaajik nyaay ke liye andolan shuru kiya
 The movement started intensifying, after which the Rajapaksa camp became worried and finally the President had to announce the mid-term election
 yahi vah samay tha jab kumarathunga ne apni chaal chali
 After a few weeks of efforts, the opposition leaders gathered at his residence and there it was planned to bring Sirisena to his camp

 He used the names of several dummy candidates in the media to keep Rajapaksa in a tizzy

 In such a situation, Union Minister Uma Bharti on Sunday said that the people of the country would be shocked if there is no way for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya under Narendra Modi as Prime Minister and Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 modi, yogi ke rahete nahin niklaa rasta do lagegaa dhakkakendriya jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan mantri uma bharti ne kaha ki yah sahi he ki modiji pradhanmantri hon or yogiji mukhyamantri hon or phir bhi ramamandir nirmaan kaa rasta na nikle to log is baat se aashcharyachakit honge ki ham ramamandir ke liye rasta kyon nahin bana paae
 He further said that it would be a push for the people
 unhone kaha ki yah sachai he ki bijepi kii (varsh 1984 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main) do siten thim
 When the Ram Mandir movement took place, in 1989, there were 84 seats from two seats and finally in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 284 seats were won
 isamen ramamandir kii bahut badi bhoomika rahi he
 Uma Bharti said that i will say the same even today, whether it is an act, an ordinance, a way to reconcile, we should find a way to build the Ram temple and everyone should cooperate in it
 is baat ke saath hona chahie ki aap (ramamandir nirmaan kii) baat shuru karo ham aapkaa saath de denge
 This initiative was also done during Atal ji and also at the time of Chandrashekhar ji
 modi kaa jaadu chalegaais sawaal par ki kya modi kaa jaadu ab bhi chalegaa? uma bharti ne kaha ki modi kaa jaadu to chalegaa
 We have just won various municipal body elections in Tripura
 vah apane aap main bahut badi kathin baat thi
 It was a difficult matter to form our government there
 isliye modi kaa jaadu abhi chal rahaa he
 Giving examples, Uma said that in 2003 we all won in the Vidhan Sabha, but lost in the Lok Sabha in the year 2004
 aisa bhi hota he ki jo vidhansabha main hota he vah loksabhaa main na ho
 On the question about calling Lord Hanuman as Jat, Muslim and Dalit, Uma Bharti said that God has only one caste, that he is God
 bhakt kii bhi ek hi jati hoti he ki vah bhakt he
 Apart from this nothing happens
 iske alaava to jaisi drushti waisi sristi hoti he
 Just as there is no caste of the sun, there is no caste of air, there is no caste of water, similarly God and devotee also have no caste

 On the way the Congress government led by the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath worked, he said that there is a beautiful discrepancy in democracy that we (BJP) got more votes, the government became their (congress)
 uma ne kaha ki ham nai sarkaar ko asthir nahin karenge
 We respect public opinion
 vah sarkaar chalaaen
 We have to see that the public is not harmed by instability and (in the Congress Party) mutual confrontation

 He should bring before the country on what basis he made this statement
 unako apane shabd waapas lene chahie or desh ke saamne maafee maangani chahie
 Question - How will you take this thing forward, because the Prime Minister has said this for two days in a row? Chakrapani - Look, the statement that has been given to shoot us
 daliton ko mat maaro
 This is such a cheap statement
 aap dekho gorakshak kii koi jati nahin hoti he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs are all cow protection
 goraksha hoti he
 See the Pink Revolution, which demanded votes to make us prime minister, we will make cow protection law
 kahaan to hamako lag rahaa tha ki goraksha ko lekar kendriya kanoon banegaa, lekin inhone 80 percent gorakshakon ko hi samaaj main vivaadit kar diya
 In this way, the guards will be seen from the eyes of the culprit, it is being seen
 sawaal- pradhanmantriji ne aisa kyon bayaan diya?chakrapani- hamako lagata he ki kaaphi dinon tak vah sangh main rahe hai
 a martyred devotee who is a cow protector never lets cows die
 mujhako lagata he ki tathakthith gorakshakon ke saath rahe hai
 The Sangh and the BJP always talk of Ram temple, cow protection, but do not work
 kyonki sangh main rahe hai to inkaa anubhav rahaa he
 So maybe 80 percent of the Sangh and people of BJP are involved in it, which are non-economic elements
 to yah jaanate honge ki wo raat ko kya karte hai
 Because has been with them
 isliye apana anubhav bol chuke hai
 So i have given them 15 days to reply
 ho saktaa usamen vah report den
 They should report it to the country

 ” yah naaraa 1990 ke dashak main gunja karata tha
 This was the time when BJP emerged as a political power on the national plank
 use gambhirtha se liya jane laga tha
 Today, after a decade and a half, when the party is not only in power, but is also strongly expressing its power, a trio of its top leaders have been asked to leave the stage quietly
 atal bihari vaajapeyi, laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ko is baar ahm nirnay lene vaali bijepi kii donon sheersh samitiyon—sansadeey board or kendriya chunaav samiti se baahar rakhaa gaya
 BJP President Amit Shah has done it very neatly
 shah hi the, jinhone isse pehle agast main adwani ko bade maje se party kii “behad oonchi shakhsiyat” qaraar dete hue shyama prasad mukherjee vaali qatari main daal diya tha
 a fortnight after the incident, the 86-year-old veteran Advani was handed over to the alleged guiding board along with the ailing Vajpayee and angry Joshi
 kai arthon main yah in diggaj netaaon ko vyaavhaarik raajnneeti se vidaai kii tarah he
 The credit for bringing the BJP ideology into the mainstream of Indian politics goes to this trilogy, a master of different personalities
 congressi samaajwaad or vampanthi samyawad ke bich unhone dakshinpanth or hindu saanskrithik rashtrawaad ke liye rajnatik jagah banaai
 Vajpayee, Advani and Joshi reached the summit by different paths
 vaajapeyi ne 1947 main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii patrika raashtra dharm or ek saal baad paanchajnya kaa sampadak banakar shuruyaat kii
 At that time, Advani was a busy Sangh pracharak in Rajasthan and Joshi was active in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in Uttar Pradesh
 teenon main vaajapeyi awwal nikle
 He lost the election in Lucknow, lost bail in Mathura and won from Balrampur and reached the Lok Sabha
 yah sab ek hi vakt 1957 ke chunaav main hua
 Advani started his political journey with the membership of Delhi Metropolitan Council in 1967, playing the role of his assistant
 is bich joshi upi main jansangh kii kataron main kaam karte hue oonche uthte gaye

 The BJP got two seats in the 1984 election
 yahi vah sabase nichalaa rajnatik padaav tha, jahaan se bijepi ne lambii kooch kii taiyaari kii
 In 1986, Advani became the party president and carried forward the agenda of the RSS with great aggression
 1990 main rathyatra kii apaar lokapriyata par savaar adwani ne vaajapeyi kii tejaswita ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 He started setting the party's agenda on his own
 yahaan tak ki unhone khud hi vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 The journey of this hapless traveler of Indian politics reached its end in June 2013, when he unsuccessfully tried to stop Modi
 1991 main adwani ke baad joshi bijepi ke adhyaksh bane
 He too loves warlike nationalism and he also took trips like Ekta Yatra
 yahi vah vakt tha, jab unki yatraaon kii ruparekha banaate hue modi unke raste main aa gaye
 Such an interesting twist in the story can only come in politics
 aaj modi ke badhate kaaravaan ne unheen diggaj netaaon kii bujurg trayee ko nai bijepi ke raste se hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 Yes, he is allowed to bless them

 Yogi Adityanath, who reached Meerut for the first time after becoming the Chief Minister, visited the Government Procurement Center on Tuesday to check whether the government system was working properly in purchasing food grains from farmers
 iske lieyogi meratjile ke kharkhuda main ek sahakaari centre par gaye or vahaan ke intjaam ko dekha
 However, information about the arrival of the Chief Minister was already there at this center
 lihaaja sari vyavastha chaak-chauband kar di gai thi
 The officers were prompt and the entire center was cleaned up
 is samay gehun kii fasal lekar tamaam kisaan kray centre par jate hai
 There are usually complaints that farmers at such centers have to wait a long time to sell their grains
 khule aasmaan ke neeche boriyon main bhare anaaj ko lekar intjaar karnaa kisaanon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban jaataa he
 There are also complaints that the reduction is made at the time of purchase, ie the amount of wheat purchased is shown to be weighed and the profits between employees and officers go together
 kai baar anaaj kharidne ke baad kisaanon ko paisa milane main der lagati he
 The Chief Minister asked the farmers about these problems at the cooperative center in Kharkhoda
 kam se kam is centre par to kisaanon ne mukhyamantri ko yahi bataaya ki unhen kisi tarah kii koi pareshaani nahin aa rahi he or keemat bhi sahi samay par mil rahi he
 Currently, the support price of wheat procurement in Uttar Pradesh is Rs 1625 per quintal
 kharkhoda centre par apana gehun lekar aae kisaan kharag singh se mukhyamantri adityanath yogi ne poocha ki aisa to nahin ho rahaa he ki kharidne main lage sarkari karmchaaree unke anaaj ko kharaab bataa rahe ho?kharag singh ne mukhyamantri ko bataaya ki aisa ab nahin ho rahaa he
 Many times the employees at such procurement centers harass the farmers by saying the grain is bad and often they are ready to buy their grain only after taking bribe
 kharkhoda centre par gehun main nami kii maatra jaanchane kii mashin bhi lagi hui thi
 For purchasing wheat at such a center, it is necessary that the moisture content should be less than 12 percent
 kharkhuda centre ke incharge dhirendra kumaar ne bataaya ki nai sarkaar aane ke baad chijen kaaphi sudhar gai hai
 Earlier, it used to take long time for the money to pay the farmers, due to which they could not pay on time even if they wanted to, but now this situation is not like this and farmers are being paid within 48 hours
 haalanki kai logon kaa yah kahana tha ki jis centre par mukhyamantri ke nirikshan kii jaankaree pehle se ho, vahaan par chijen durust hona swaabhaavik he
 Many farmers said that the Chief Minister should suddenly go and inspect such a center, so that the real situation can be known

 Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has tweeted and expressed his displeasure and concern over the sudden advisory for tourists to cease travel in view of the possibility of terrorist attacks in the state
 unhone kaha ki syriasli? aapane sochaa he ki ek sarkari aadesh se paryatak jaldi se ghati chhodkar bhaagane lagenge? kitne paryatak is aadesh ko dekhakar bhaagane lagenge
 People fleeing will jam the airport and the highway
 Seriously? You think an official order telling tourists to leave immediately will not cause them to run from the valley as fast as they can? Which tourist will hang around after seeing this order
 The airport & highway will be choked with people leaving
 https: / / t
 co / wzvllsqvpk— Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) August 2, 2019 Earlier in another tweet, Omar Abdullah expressed concern over the state of the situation saying that this unexpected order indicates that Amarnath pilgrims and tourists are being warned of terror attacks
 The fear and ominousness present in the valley cannot be reduced
 Although this unprecedented order would seem to suggest a genuine fear of a massive terror strike directed at Amarnath ji yatris or / and tourists this will do nothing to dampen the sense of fear & foreboding that prevails in the valley at the moment

 According to the news of news agency PTI, Jairam Ramesh mentioned during the discussion several schemes of Modi government and also explained their benefits
 jairam ramesh ne kaha ki 2014 se 2019 tak modi sarkaar ne bijli ke kshetra main, ujjwala yojana ke jariye lakhon logon ko phayda pahunchaaya he, yahi kaaran he ki logon ne unpar vishwaas jataayaa or vipaksh ko is baat ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 The Congress leader said that Narendra Modi speaks in a language which people understand easily
 hamen ye bhi maananaa hoga ki jo kaam lambey samay se nahin hua, wo unke pehle kaarykaal main hua
 This is why you cannot compete with them without accepting their work
 sirf unki buraai karne se koi phayda nahin hone vaala he
 In his speech, the former Union Minister gave the example of 'pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana' and said that this scheme was very successful, which reached the ground level
 unhone kaha ki 2019 ke chunaav main centre sarkaar kii kuch yojanaon kaa majaak udaaya gaya, lekin PMUY unamem se ek thi jisane karodon logon ko phayda pahunchaaya or centre sarkaar ke liye dobaaraa vot karne ke liye protsaahit kiya

 Singhvi wrote that presenting a negative image of Modi would be of no use, he is the Prime Minister of the country and doing so only benefits him
 modi sarkaar kii ujjwala skim acchhee yojanaon main se ek hai
 Always said demonising # Modiwrong
 No only is he # pmof nation, a one way opposition actually helps him
 Acts are always good, bad & indifferent — they must be judged issue wise and nt person wise
 Certainly, # ujjawalascheme is only one amongst other good deeds

 aam taur par khatarnaak website jaanchane kaa tarika ye he ki URL ke pehle HTTPS he yaa nahin
 If there is HTTPS then the website is secure
 agar nahin he to shaayad khatra ho saktaa he
 But what if you start seeing HTTPS at the beginning of a dangerous website URL? Obviously, it is almost impossible for you to identify which website is dangerous and which is not
 havers ab aisa hi kar rahe hai
 HTTPS will also be found in front of the website sent for fishing and the website will look like a real domain
 hekking kaa sabase aasaan rasta fishing mana jaataa he
 But this is a way that most users can also buy
 kyonki agar thodi bhi jaankaree ho to fishing ko samajha ja saktaa he or isse bachaav kiya ja saktaa he
 But now hackers are also bringing such methods in fishing which is quite easy, but the target user cannot understand it
 china Infosec researchrars ne ek nae tareeke kii fishing kii khoj kii he jise detect kar paanaa lagbhag naammumkin he
 This fishing attack can also target those users who click the links on the Internet very thoughtfully
 research ne kaha he ki havers krom, firefox auropera web browgers ko yuj karke fishingkar sakate hai
 For this, they steal the user's sensitive information and login details by creating a fake domain name of websites like Apple, Google and Amazon
 asli kii tarah dikhne vaali farji website bana kar bank acount frod se lekar kai badi hekking ko anjaam diya ja saktaa he
 If you look at these two website addresses carefully, you will find that they are the same, but one is real and the other is to differentiate between fake and fake website
 To avoid difficult phishing attack, you see HTTPS next to the URL of the website
 lekin aap is demo pej ko dekhakar hairaan rah jaaenge
 Chinese security researcher Xuadong Zheng has created a demo webpage that anyone can see that this is Apple's official website
 die gaye link par clic karne se ek website khulti he jisek adress baar main https: / / www
 apple
 com likhaa he
 Even if you open the official website of Apple, you will see the same
 lekin jaahir he yah demo he yani aipal kii website nahin balki phek he
 You cannot differentiate between these two
 is link par clic karenge to aipal jaisi dikhne vaali website khulegi
 Researcher has written on this website that it is not an Apple website and is designed to demystify the flaws of the web browser
 darasal aipal jaisaa dikhne vaala yah URL ye he
 In this way the attack is also called homograph attack which started from 2001
 iske tahat unicode kairactor ko aam kairactor se riples kar diya jaataa he or dekhne main yah asli domen nem jaisaa hi lagata he
 You can call it a browser flaw, because browser companies have failed to solve this problem
 web browgers kii khaamiyon kii vajah se ye sambhav hua haresearch ke mutabik broujar kaa yah lupahole research ko domen nem rajarister kaa mauka detaa he or protection ko bypass kar liya jaataa he
 The researcher apples for this
 com kaa code yuj kiya he
 However, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari Web Brisers do not have this flaw and you will not be able to open this link there
 jabaki sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala krom briuger main yah khami he or saath hi firefox main bhi yah khami he jo khatre ko bulaava de rahi he
 How to avoid such an attack using safefirefox, then write about: config in the address bar
 yahaan search baar main Punycode likhembroujar settings main ek paramitre dikhegaa jahaan network

 There are currently no tricks for Google Chrome, but you can hedge your risk through a third party extension

 Many bloggers have proved through good reporting that the information that traditional magazines and programs were providing was incomplete and needed to overcome their shortcomings

 Now before the weekend or youtube uploads, the story started going to the people

 He no longer needed the medium of journalists to give his initial information
 ab companiyaan apane man kii baat sidhe graahakon tak pahunchaa sakati thim, fesabook or utyub live ke zarie
 Now this is a situation where many magazines, TV shows and bloggers had to reassign their roles
 aise main jaisaa ki hota he ab res chal rahi he
 a review or test drive report of any launch or test drive event is uploaded within a few hours and every car discussion ends in a day or two
 alag-alag utyub channelon or websites par gadiyon kii ek ek jaankaree aa jaati he
 In a few minutes the perception starts to form and in a few hours it is decided whether the car is worth buying or not
 test drive ke dedline kii daudbhag ne kiya ye he ki gadiyon kii reporting se jude sabhi log ek hi jaise lagane lage hai
 Now bloggers writing on TV, auto shows on youtube, auto channels on youtube, facebook-instagram and on the Internet, all board a train and arrive at a launch event in Rayleigh, arrive on a junket drive, snicker drive report Starts coming, tweets start coming in and updates start coming
 ab vaaki multimedia kaa vaqt aa gaya he

 The comments jabaki sabhi reports ko dekhen to lagegaa ki jitani ho sake sabhi kamiyon or kuubiyon ke bare main jaankariyaan to de hi di jaati hai
 Still, despite all the information, the human mind probably prefers the decision taken after taking time, so i keep getting questions till several days after every launch
 pehle esemes par aata tha, email par aata tha
 Now questions come from all sides
 fesabook profil par, fesabook pej par, twitor par, utyub or instagram par

 How could she not change her picture in five or 10 years? mayawati ne kaha, ‘congress pradesh main apni dayaneey sthiti se is kadar ghabaraai hui he ki is party ke logon or uske yuvaraj (rahul) ko dilli main sansad chhodkar yahaan aakar kism-kism kii naatakabaaji kerani pad rahi he
 On the satire of Rahul that the elephant sitting in Lucknow eats money sent by the Center for development schemes, the BSP president said, "our party's policies and mass base have made it difficult for the Congress to live in the country
" hamen aisa lagata he ki pradesh main hamaari party kaa chunaav chihan hathi use sapane main daudata he
 Mayawati cautious the Dalits and the backward by the tactics of the opposition parties and said that they should not come under any kind of deception
 agar aisa hota he to vah vishwaas ke saath kah sakati hai ki basapa aagaamee chunaav main ‘chalegaa hathi udegi dhul, na cycle rahegi na panja na phool’ ke naare ko buland karte hue kamyaabi hasil karegi
 Giving the credit of reservation to Dalits as well as backward to Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, he said that till the full development of Dalits in the state, Dalits will continue to be the Chief Minister in the state from the BSP
 uske baad pichde varg ke pratinidhi ko mukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 This exercise will take at least 15 years
 mayawati ne kaha ki kuch partiyaan apane raajnneetik laabh ke liye dalit yaa pichde varg ke logon ko mukhyamantri bana bhi den to bhi in virgo kaa vikaas nahin hoga, kyonki satta kii bagdor anya virgo ke haath main hi hoti he
 The Chief Minister blamed the previous governments of the state for the failure of Dalits and backward people in the state and said that their government had inherited the problems arising due to the wrong policies of those governments
 natijatan kharaab aarthik sthiti ke kaaran unki sarkaar dalit tathaa pichhade virgo kii samasyaon ko puri tarah dur nahin kar saki he
 Responding to Rahul's statement about moving to other states for employment of the people of the state, Mayawati said, "during the Congress rule in the state, most people migrated to other states for livelihood
 isse bhi zyada dukh kii baat yah he ki congress inhen logon ko beemaari kahkar pukaarti he
 Continuing the attack on Rahul, the Chief Minister said, 'congress lied that most of the money sent by the Center goes to officers, ministers and BSP workers
 aisa lagata he ki congress apana hi purana tajurba bataa rahi he
 Targeting Rahul, Mayawati said that the Congress is presenting the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) as its plan which is wrong
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ne apane puure road sho ke dauraan juthi baaten kin, jhuthe aashwaasan dekar janata ko bhramit karne kii koshish kii
 He tried to convey his plan to NREGA whereas it is a scheme to be operated under a central act in which all parties contribute
 ’ mayawati ne kaha, ‘congress ke kuch padaadhikari sasti lokapriyata ke liye uttar pradesh main naregaa ke kriyanvayan main gadabadiyon kii baaten kar rahe hai
 We have made good arrangements to prevent disturbances and if any officer is found involved in irregularities then strict action is taken against him
 ’mukhyamantri ne mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana (manaregaa) kii vyaavhaarikta par sawaal khadey karte hue elaan kiya ki rajya ke baad kendra main unki sarkaar banane par paatr logon ko ek saal main 100 din ke bajaay puure 365 din rojgaar diya jayega
 Mayawati surrounded the Congress on the issue of familism and said that all her family members are away from politics and if she ever aspires to become an MP or MLA, she will break her ties so that she is not accused of spreading dynasticism like Congress 
 unhone kaha ki daliton or pichhadon ke kalyaan ke prati purna samarpan jari rakhane ke liye hi unhone vivaah nahin kiya or aaj vah in vishaal virgo ko hi apana parivaar maanati hai
 The BSP president said that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar had arranged Article 340 in the constitution for the interests of the Dalits as well as the backward, after which, according to the report of the Mandal Commission constituted, they have got the same rights as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 mayawati ne daawa kiya ki daliton or pichhadon ke liye jitna kaam unki sarkaar ne kiya he utana kisi ne nahin kiya
 He enumerated several welfare schemes including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mahamaya Garib Madad Yojana and Uttar Pradesh Mahamaya Garib Balika Ashirwad Yojana
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke jald swasth hone kii kaamana karte hue basapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki unhen apane sutron se pataa laga he ki sonia ke biimaar hone ke kaaran rahul ko congress kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh tathaa pradhanmantri banaae jane kii sugabugahat ke chalate hi kendriya mantrimandal ne rahul ke videshi doston ko khush karne ke liye khudara bazaar main videshi nivesh kii manjuuri di he
 He said that small businessmen will be ruined by this decision of foreign investment and if the Congress government comes to the state then this state will become the number one poor state in the country in five years
 mayawati ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue kendra sarkaar samvidhan main sanshodhan karke daliton tathaa pichhadon kii kai shreniyan banaakar aapako baantne kii koshish kar sakati he
 There is a need to be smart with this
 uttar pradesh ke punargathan kaa prastaav paarit karaane ke paksh main tark dete hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki santulit vikaas ke liye is vishaal pradesh kaa vibhaajan karnaa jaruri he
 Opening his cards on this issue, he said that opposition parties do not want the development of the state
 lihaaja, vah rajya sarkaar dwaara vidhansabha main paarit karaae gaye prastaav ko kendra main rokane kii koshish karenge
 The public will have to teach these parties a lesson in elections
 kanoon vyavastha tathaa kaledhan ke mudde par samaajawaadee party (sapa) tathaa bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko gherte hue mayawati ne kaha ki sapa ke shasankaal main gundgardee or mafiagardee bad gayi thi
 Such people should not be allowed to return to power
 unhone kaha, ‘kendra main apane shasankaal main bhaajapa ne samvidhan samiksha kii aad main pichhadon tathaa daliton ke adhikaron ko khatm karne kii puri koshish kii thi
 The leaders of this party are talking about bringing back the black money stashed in foreign banks, while they do not have the right to say such things
 ’mayawati ne kaha ki bhaajapa jab kendra main kai varshon tak sattashin thi tab vah kaale dhan ko naa to waapas laai or naa hi is silsile main koi sakht kanoon banaaya
 Due to internal collusion with BJP, the present Central Government is also not making any strict laws in this regard
 isse lagata he ki ye partiyaan andar hi andar apni rotiyaan senk rahi hai
 Calling the BSP to form the government once again in the state, the Chief Minister said, 'I promise that i will continue to serve the bsp's movement till death
 aapako pradesh main ek baar phir basapa kii sarkaar banani hogi
 'he said,' Assembly elections can be held anytime now in the state
 lihaaja, main aaj hi party ke chunaav abhiyaan kii ghoshnaa karti hum
 Party workers should get ready for the election
 ’ mayawati ne kaha ki basapa aagaamee 18 disambar ko lakhanu main muslim-kshatriya-vaisya samaaj kaa mahasammelan yojit karegi

 The 33-year-old cook was only 3667 runs behind Sachin Tendulkar's break of this record and was probably a strong contender to leave the record behind, but after his retirement, hardly any batsman will reach this huge record of Sachin

 'cook said,' Although it is a sad day for me, but i am doing it with a big smile on my face because i know that i have given everything to this game
 maine kabhi sochaa nahin tha ki itnaa kuch hasil karuunga or itane lambey samay tak kuch mahaan khilaadiyon ke saath kheloongaa
 The opener said that he will lack the dressing room atmosphere the most

 ’ cook ne haalanki kaha ki vah asex ke saath captain ke taur par aagaamee satr main jude rahenge
 As a batsman, Cook had neither the technique of David Gawer nor the shots of Kevin Pietersen but his incredible concentration and ability to score runs made him one of the top run-scorers in the game
 cook ke kariyar kii sabase badi safaltacook ke kariyar kii sabase badi safalataa captain ke taur par 2012 main bharat main 2-1 se test siries main jeet darj karnaa tha

 It has been almost two months since the film Padmavat was released
 ye movie kaaphi vivaadon ke baad relies hui or isane box offis par dhamal machaa diya
 During an interview recently, Deepika shared interesting information about her character
 deepika padukon ne india today ko die intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya ki maharani padmavati kaa role unke jivan kaa sabase mushkil role rahaa he
 In the film, Padmavati was not just a sword fighter and a warrior in the battlefield
 unka ye kirdaar bajirao mastaani ke kirdaar se kaaphi bhinn tha
 Empress Padmavati was a skilled warrior by force as well as intimacy and temperament
 VIDEO: aise shoot hua padmavat kaa 'binate dil' gaanaa, ant main bhansaali bole
 
 
 According to Deepika, to become a warrior from the body one only has to learn swordsmanship, while to become a warrior with a soul one has to fully feel that accent
 film main aisa kirdaar nibhaana itnaa aasaan nahin hota
 Deepika further revealed that it was very difficult to shoot the character during Johar in the film

 hamaara desh vibhinn dharmon ke samoohon ke liye kanoon or shashan ke siddhanton ke sandarbh main ek bahut hi najuk santulan par aadhaarit he
 However, the statement does not directly mention the Triple Talaq Bill
 lekin jadyu sutron ne bataaya ki prastaavit vidheyak samaan naagarik samhita par unke ruukh ke centre main he kyonki bhaajapa ne musalamaanon kii teen talaak kii pratha ko aparaadh kii shrenee main daalane par aksar jor diya he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JDU had opposed the bill during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first term
 party ne apana ruukh doharaate hue spasht kiya he ki jadyu apane ruukh par dridhtaa se kaayam he
 Tyagi said, 'we believe that this (uniform Civil Code) still needs serious consultation with various religious groups

 Let me tell you, during the first term of the Modi government, the triple talaq bill was stuck in the Rajya Sabha because it does not have the required numbers
 ucch sadan main ise paarit karaane ke liye sarkaar ko gaiyr-rajg dalon ke samarthan kii bhi jarurat hogi
 However, opposition parties like JDU as well as the opposition are likely to face difficulties in the Rajya Sabha

 From his father Mulayam Singh Yadav to the top leaders of the Samajwadi Party (SP), he publicly scolds them for not being able to run the government properly
 varisht adhikariyon main ye charchaaen aam hai ki rajya ke saadhe paanch mukhyamantri hai
 Then, reports from various parts of the state indicate that the sp's Muslim base has declined following the Muzaffarnagar riots

 GST (goods and Services Tax) still remains a major complication for the people of the entire country
 jiesti ko lagu hue lagbhag 50 din ho gaye hai, par log abhi bhi is pareshaani main hai ki jiesti alag-alag madon par kaise lagu kiya jaataa he
 Explain that GST was implemented on 1 July 2017
 aamtaur par upabhokta kisi hotel yaa restaraan main khaane-pine ke liye jaataa he to bill ko dhyaan se nahin dekhtaa
 But even after the implementation of GST, if you do not do it then it is possible that more money is being charged from you
 abhi bhi bahut se restaraan aise he jo apni marji ke anusaar tex charge lagaate hai
 Keep these things in mind while checking the tax imposed on the bill
 1
 Service Fee It is not mandatory to pay service charges in any restaurant
 graahak seva shulk kaa bhugtan karne se inkaar karne kaa hakdaar he
 It has not been imposed by the government
 2
 What is the applicable GST rates in restaurants? Different dining outlets or restaurants have different GST rates
 -non asi restaraan / non-alcohol sevarat hotel ke liye, yah 12% he
 For AC / alcohol-serving hotels, it is 18%
 -5 sitara hotalon ke liye, yah 28% he
 3
 esgsti or sijisti kya he?kai upabhokta esgsti or sijisti ke bich uljhan main he
 SGST is for the State Goods and Services Tax, while CGST is for the Central Goods and Services Tax
 iskaa matlab ye bhi he ki aap jo kar kaa bhugtan karte hai uskaa aadha rajya ke khajaane main jaataa he jabaki anya aadha centre sarkaar ke rajkosh main jaataa he
 4
 aap jis restaraan main bhojan kar rahe hai kya wo jiesti charge karne ke yogya he?yah aapako chaunkaa saktaa he lekin sabhi restaraan or bhojanalay jiesti ke liye prabharee nahin hai
 Non-registered businesses are not allowed to levy GST
 yah pataa karne ke liye ki aap jis restaraan main kha rahe hai, wo panjikrut he
 You can check the GST number given on the bill
 5
 VAT v / s GST liquor is excluded from the purview of GST, so if you take liquor with food in restaurants, then GST will be imposed only on food and not on alcohol
