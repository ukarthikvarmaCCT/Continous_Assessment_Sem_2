 It was the morning of May 2, 2012
 dilli sthit sena mukhyalay main sainya abhiyaan nideshaalay ke afasaron ne rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar board ke sadasyon ke liye ek brifing rakhi
 In this, a presentation was made on the strategic loss of renaming the Siachen Glacier
 ab ye afasar rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi brif karnaa chaah rahe hai
 As the UPA government has released the pigeon of peace towards Pakistan, Chief of Army Staff General V
 ke
 Under Singh's leadership, the army has played a siren of danger on Siachen
 raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ne 30 april ko loksabhaa ko suchit kiya tha ki sarkaar siachin ko senamukt karne ke liye pakistan ke saath sarthak samvaad karne main juty he
 The defense secretaries of the two countries will meet in Islamabad by the end of the year to prepare for this
 shahadat ke dam par siachin ko jeetne vaali bhartiya fouj is baat par adig he ki netaaon ko siachin kaa sauda karne se har haal main rokna he
 As usual, Antony was repeating Manmohan Singh's peace screenplay
 upie ke pehle kaarykaal main 13 june, 2005 ko pradhanmantri ne siachin base camp par javaanon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha thah ''siachin ko sabase ooncha yudhakshetra mana jaataa he jahaan jinda rahanaa mushkil he
 Now the time has come that we should try to convert this point of struggle into a symbol of peace
 '' sarkaar main baithe sutron ke mutabik, siachin se sena hataane ke mudde par vaarta ko pradhanmantri ne hi badhaava diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the world's highest battlefield for the Prime Minister — a snow-capped symbol of the Indian Army's sacrifice — is a separate issue from Jammu and Kashmir and the withdrawal of the army would mean restoring the atmosphere of dialogue that 26 / 11 Was derailed after the Mumbai attacks
 pakistan ke saath vishwaas bahaali kaa manmohan singh kaa tarika sena ko siachin se hataanaa he
 However, those who oppose it believe that Manmohan Singh has also got the fever of Nobel Peace Prize and is caught in the greed of temporary private appreciation at the cost of national interest
 ve aisa karke itihaas main darj ho janaa chaahate hai
 Siachen is the largest mountain glacier in the world, situated at an altitude of 21,000 feet
 yahaan taapmaana shunya se 50 degree neeche tak chalaa jaataa he, phir bhi bhartiya sena yahaan hardam mustaid rahati he
 On the south western side of the Siachen Glacier is Saltoro Ridge
 1984 main bhartiya guptchar agenciyon ko is baat ke thos suraag mili the ki pakistani fouj saltoro par kabja jamaane kii yojana bana rahi he
 At that time, Pervez Musharraf was the commander of the Skardu brigade and was also an officer in charge operations
 13 april, 1984 ko bhartiya fouj ne meghdoot ke naam se hawaii abhiyaan shuru kiya
 The climbers of the Kumaon Regiment were landed on the Saltoro Ridge to capture the major peaks
 48 ghante ke bheetar hi pakistani fouj ne bhi oparation shuru kar diya
 The battle broke out in the fierce cold at a considerable height, but the Indian Army, which had been occupied earlier, remained there
 bhartiya sena is badhat ko thaal main sajaakar pakistani fouj ko katai nahin saunpna chaahati
 The Indian Army here on the troops of Rs
 5 crores per day
 kharch aata he
 There have also been accidents in which many soldiers have been killed
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa major general atahar abbaas ne 14 april ko neuyork times ko bataaya tha ki vahaan 1984 se lekar ab tak 3,000 pakistani jawan maare ja chuke hai, jinamein 90 fisadi mausam kii maar ke shikaar hue hai
 Pakistan Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, on April 18, said that the dispute should now be resolved after 140 soldiers were killed by avalanches at the Gyari base
 unhone kaha, ''donon mulkon ko mil-baithkar siachin samet saare mudde sulajh lene chahie
 Pakistan deployed its troops on Siachen in response to the occupation of a part of the glacier by the Indian Army
 faujee to mulk kii hifaazat kaa apana ferj nibhaa rahe hai, lekin hal khojane kaa kaam to siyaasi leadership ko hi karnaa he
 "this tragedy has changed the political hearts in Pakistan
" purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne siachin se pakistani fouj ko ekatarfa taur par waapas bulaane kii jarurat ke bare main kaha he
 Sharif told reporters at Skardu Airport after visiting the avalanche area on April 17, "don't make it a case of ego
" pakistan ko pahal kerani chahie
 "it is a different matter that the emotions at the ground level are so bitter that it forced Sharif to withdraw the statement
" or pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar or pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke netaa imran khan ne india today ko bataaya, ''pakistan or hindustan ko siachin se ek saath tukadiyaan hataa leni chahie
 Such statements are like melodious tunes for Manmohan Singh
 raksha rajyamantri em
 M
 pallamaraju ne kayaani ke bayaan kaa swaagat karne main jaraa bhi deree nahin lagaai
 Manmohan Singh's aspiration to make Siachen the pinnacle of peace suddenly began to receive air from across the border
 ab tak siachin par donon deshon ke bich 12 daur kii vaarta ho chuki he, lekin maamla atka padaa he
 Pakistan still does not accept the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) as it will send a message to the people that its army was never on Siachen
 bhartiya fouj saltoro rij par he jabaki pakistani fouj glacier se kam-se-kam do se saat kimi kii duuri par he
 Government sources say that the Prime Minister is confident of clearing the roads in the way of removing the army
 donon hi desh 1984 se lagaataar chotiyaan fatah karne ke liye hode laga rahe hai
 Musharraf waged a war in Kargil in 1999 to avenge Siachen, but was killed and more than 700 Pakistani soldiers were killed
 2003 main ramajaan ke dauraan yuddh-viraam ghoshit hua jo aaj tak jari he
 Pakistan has tried to drive India out of the region, but its troops have failed
 jo kaam vah jang ke maidan main nahin kar sakaa, ab vahi kootneeti se puraa kar lene kii ichha paale baitha he
 India believes that Pakistan is suffering more due to the status quo
 jahaan tak bhartiya sena kaa sawaal he, vah siachin par samjhauta nahin kar sakati
 "there is no reason for withdrawal from Siachen right now," said a highly placed source at the military headquarters
 samrik or taatkaalik taur par itani oonchai par niyantran bharat ke haq main he
 Pakistan never gave India a chance to trust it
 is bare main chif (ve
 K
 singh) kii soch bahut saaf he
 If the order for the withdrawal of the troops comes, they will ask for this order in writing and they will also reply in writing that they oppose the withdrawal in the national interest
 uske baad faisla pradhanmantri par hoga
 According to sources, when former Army Chief General J
J

 When there was increasing pressure on Singh to withdraw the army from Siachen, he had publicly stated that it was not in the national interest
 sutara ne kaha, ''maujuuda senadhyaksh saarvajanik bayaan to nahin denge, lekin rajnatik tikadamon kii vedi par rashtriya hit se samjhauta bhi nahin hone denge
 "in view of the Prime Minister's extreme enthusiasm, the Army is now trying to spread awareness through its retired generals on the ground reality and the need to maintain possession of Saltoro Ridge
" sena 1947 se lekar ab tak pakistan dwaara kiye gaye vishwasghaaton kii suchi taiyaar kar rahi he jise vah puraane generalon ko degi taaki ve ''desh ko shikshit kar saken
 "former Director General of Military Intelligence Lieutenant General Ravi Sahni asks," Pakistan has broken every written and verbal agreement since 1947
 aakhir hamaare pradhanmantri is sachaai se aankh moond kar pakistan par vishwaas kyon karnaa chaah rahe hai?'' purv sena pramukh general veda prakaash malik kehete hai, ''aakhir kya guarantee he ki bharat jin shikharon ko chhodega, vahaan pakistan kabja nahin karegaa? farvari 1999 main lahore shanti prakriya ke kuch maheenon baad hi pakistani sena ne niyantran rekha kaa ulanghan karke kargil main kai bhartiya chaukiyon par kabja kar liya tha
 This incursion into Kargil was a violation of the Line of Control as defined under the Simla Agreement validated by both armies and governments in 1972
 ''desh kaa sainya ranneetik samudaay sarkaar ke shanti behaal karne ke is ravaie ke bilkul khilaaf he
 He wants the infiltration from Pakistan to stop, he should close his terrorist camps, eliminate the terrorist groups on his land who have a malicious attitude towards India, only then can they move forward on Siachen
 baharhaal, siachin main bharat ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he
 According to government data for the last 10 years, 204 army personnel were killed here in 2000
 2001 main yah sankhya 198, 2002 main 201, 2003 main 187, 2004 main 23 (ramajaan yuddh viraam ke baad) or 2005 main sirf do rahi

 India will not take a step forward
 ''intelligence beuro ke purv nideshak ajit dowaal chetate hai, ''bharat ke liye asal chintaa pakistan pryojit aatankwaad he
 Has he shut down the factory of terror? Has he arrested Hafiz Saeed or Dawood Ibrahim, the head of jamaat-ud-dawa? Has Pakistan stopped the raids where fake Indian notes are printed? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cannot force the army to withdraw from the summit only on the basis of hollow claims and untimely words
 ''ranneetik samudaay manmohan singh ke is siachin daanv ko 'ranneetik aatmghaat' kaa naam de rahaa he
 Lieutenant General Sawhney asks why Pakistan is so rash about the withdrawal of the Indian Army from there? They also answer themselves, "because the deployment of the Indian Army is so strategic there that it can keep an eye on everything and if necessary, can cross the axis of pakistan-china in the northern areas
" saltoro rij par kabja ladakh or kargil main ghusane se rokane ke lihaaj se bhi ahm he
 This is our most advance defense line
 ham jahaan khadey hai, vahaan se peeche hatane or dobaaraa tainaati kii keemat kahin zyada chukaani padegi
 "the army has prepared a very detailed presentation for the government that why India should not withdraw the army from Siachen
" bhartiya fouj prabhaavshaalee oonchai par tainaat he jo parvatiy yuddh ke lihaaj se ahm he
 The Indian Army can also keep an eye on the growing activities of pakistan-china due to its position on the Saltoro Ridge
 pakistan ne kathith taur par gilgit or baltistan kaa bada hissaa china ko vikaas ke liye saunp diya he
 There are reports of thousands of Chinese troops and engineers in these areas
 bhartiya sena siachin glacier ke aage saltoro rij par tainaat he jo jammu or kashmir tathaa ladakh kii raksha ke liye ahm he
 Pakistan wants to focus its attention on Afghanistan to gain strategic strength there in view of the planned withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in 2014

 Major General Bakshi says, "first there was an embarrassing settlement in sharm-el-sheikh, where Manmohan Singh knelt on Balochistan
 uske baad thimpu main jhatka laga jahaan 26 / 11 ke shadyantrkariyon ke khilaaf koi karrwai na karne ke baavjood pakistan jimmedaari se batch niklaa or ab siachin se prastaavit sena hataanaa
 If the Prime Minister ignores the army's advice on Siachen, then he will do huge injustice to the nation
 ''centre for land warfare studies ke purv nideshak brigadier gurmeet kanwal tark dete hai, ''aaj takanic ke sahare kisi bhi samjhaute ke ulanghan or tukadiyon kii gatividhi par nigaraanee rakhana sambhav he
 If Pakistan violates the agreement then there will be a provision for punitive action against it
 '' draas main brigade kaa sanchaalan kar chuke brigadier rajeev williams kehete hai, ''bharat or pakistan ko kargil or siachin se aage dekhnaa hoga
 Removing forces will save both lives and precious resources

 It is difficult to say how successful bjp's attempt to break into the bsp's Dalit vote bank will be
 lekin, buddha dharm apana chuke daliton ke bich bijepi kii send lagane kii koshish ne bispi ke saamne chintaa kii lakeeren jarur khinch di hai
 The way the BSP is engaged in organizing a conference among the Brahmins, in the same way the BJP is also trying to reach out among the bsp's neo-buddhists, so both parties have come face to face with the Dalits
 kanpur main hue dhamm chetana yatra main bijepi ke manch parabuddha bhikshuonki maujuudagi se tilamilaai bispi ne ise nakli dhamm chetana yatra qaraar diya
 The BSP states that the Buddhist monks present on the stage were not real Buddhists
 saath hi is dhamm chetana yatra main koi dalit bhi maujuud nahin tha
 Mayawati had said- Sangh people were involved in the yatra
bsp supremo Mayawati said that BJP is using religion for political and electoral interests
 pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar is party dwaara nikaali gai dhamm chetana yatra kuch pryojit baudgh bhikshuon ke jariye nikalwai gai he
 The people of the union were involved in this
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh ne kaha-maafee maange mayawatimayawatike bayaan ke baad bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh keshav maury ne kaha he ki mayawati ne buddha bhikshuon kaa apmaan kiya he
 They should apologize for this
 saaf he bispi or bijepi ab dalit-buddha raajnneeti par aamane-saamne hai
 What is the reason for the altercation? There is also a reason that the newly Dalit Buddhists also consider themselves Ambedkarites, who want Baba Saheb's dream India
 daliton ke bich bijepi kabhi buddha ko lekar nahin gai or ye log yaa to bispi yaa phir arpiai sareekhee partiyon se hi zyada judaav mahasoos karte rahe hai
 But, for the first time, BJP has also entered here
 dhamm yatra bispi kii pahchaan rahi he, lekin bijepi ab ise bhi apane paale main karne main jute gai he
 This is the reason why no party has responded to the Dhamma Chetna Yatra except the BSP
 dhamm yatra ko amit shah ne kiya sambodhit174 din or upi ke dalit gaanvon-kasbon kii kareeb 27 hajaar kimi kii yatra kar yedhamm chetana yatrakanpur pahunchi thi, jahaan saikadon kii taadaat main aae bhikshuon ko amit shah ne sambodhit kiya tha
 However, this Dhamma Chetna Yatra also faced opposition in many places

 'enie sadhvi pragna ke maamle main sarkaar ke dabaav main kaam kar rahi he, is aarope par sadhvi ne kaha, 'yah vahi enie he jinhone vishesh taur par aise keson ke liye enie kaa gathan kiya tha
 The NIA was formed by the Congress after the 26 / 11 attacks after the Mumbai attack
 inhone apane vishesh taur par apane logon ko is team main jagah di thi
 Today, they have started raising questions on them
 ab inke mat ko main kya kahuun
 On the statement of Omar Abdullah in which he said that your health is well, then you are fit to go back to jail, Sadhvi Pragya said, 'his information is wrong
 mujhe lagata he unhone yah kyon nahin kaha ki mujhe tatkaal faansee par lataka dena chahie
 This was their conspiracy
 mujhe swasthya ke aadhaar par bel nahin mili he
 Sadhvi Pragya said on the Hindu Rashtra case that it is not a crime
 congress desh ke naam par seva karne waalon ke antkavaadi kah detii he
 The Congress wants to make India a terrorist country
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main sadhvi pragna ne kaha ki congress ke kukarmon kaa sakshaat pramaan main hum
 Digvijay Singh is accused of promoting the doctrine of Hindu terrorism
 is par kiye gaye sawaal ke jawaab main sadhvi pragna ne kaha, 'ye kisi bhi vyakti ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se andar kar sakate hai
 And anyone can accuse him
 aarope lagane kii aadat inaki puraani he
 'sadhvi Pragya said,' NIA has proved that i am not a terrorist
 congress ke sheersh netaa jamaanat par hai
 i am pure main kisi bhi maamle main sanlipt nahin hum
 Sadhvi Pragya said that the Congress wants to sensitize the society
 inhone mujhe mrit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 God has protected me
 congress shadyantr karti he or logon ko fansaati he

 There is a lifeless world of snow at a height of more than 18 thousand feet
 jahaan kii jameen ke saath aasmaan bhi jindagi kaa dushman he lekin barf kii is banjar duniya main insaani kadamon kii aahat goonjati he
 He is not an ordinary person, but he is a brave ITBP who is standing in the watch of the border between India and China
 himalay kii god main rahete hue ye jawan sarhad kii suraksha is barfile ilaake main karte hai
 The danger is not greater than the enemies faced by the sheet of ice spread throughout the region
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik hieltitudemein javaanon par mausam kii maar itani zyaada padati he ki unako usase ubar paanaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 ITBP trainers are kept in step by step different temperature altitudes for several days before going to this temperature when these soldiers walk in the snowy area
 uske baad jab ye jawan barfile ilaake main rahane ke liye abhyast ho jate hai tab in javaanon ko sabase upar yani 18,700 fit kii oonchai par bharat china seemaa kii biopi main tainaat kiya jaataa he
 Even though there are many difficulties for the soldiers in this snowy area, these ITBP jawans always risk their lives for the country's dignity and pride
 barfile ilaake main sarhad kii nigaraanee ye pahanakar karte hai jawanbal kalava- ye resham or oon kaa bana hota he ye is barfistaan main javaanon ko thand se bachaata he
 1 Snow Goggle - Protects soldiers from ultra violet rays
 jab snow par surya kii kiran padati he to javaanon ko color blindness kaa khatara rahata he ye snow gogal us khatre se bhi bachaata he
 Sun screen on 2 faces - Because high altitude UV rays are high and darkens the seals, so the sun screen is installed
 3 AVD (avalanch victim divaais)- jab jawan avalanch pron aria se jate hai tab ye yantra agar koi barf ke pahaad ke neeche avalanch aane se dab jaataa he tab unako dhudhane main kaam aata he
 4 Bag Pack- It contains ready made food pack, seals ration, stove, avalanche cord, dry fruits, chocolate, oatmeal etc
 5 aadhunik juute- javaanon ke juute khaas tareeke ke banaae jate hai jab jawan is juute ko pahante hai to sharir ke dharshan se ye juute andar kaaphi garam ho jate hai
 This is how 'operation Evlan' for the soldiers is an invisible danger of Avalanch when the youth are protecting the border
 is avalanch ke aane ke baad jawan barf ke pahaad ke neeche dab jate hai
 After all, how is the entire rescue operation and how does avalanche come
 aapako bataa den ki siachin main chah din tak kareeb tees feet barf ke neeche bhi jinda bachakar nikalne vaale sena ke jawan hanumanthappa ko haalanki bachaaya nahin ja sakaa tha par isse sikh jarur milti he
 On 3 February 2016, when the Sonam post of Siachen, Hanumanthappa and the remaining 9 soldiers were deployed at a height of 19 thousand 600 feet, then the most dreaded attack of nature occurred as avalanche
 barf kii chattan unki post par aakar palabar main giri or phir sabakuch shant ho gaya
 a wall of snow 1 km wide and 800 meters high fell on his camp
 or saare jawan dab gaye the
 All these are telling here that ITBP, like the Army, is also deployed in high altitude
 jahaan par agar koi avalanch yaa phir himaskhalan hota he to jawan aise bachate hai
 Radio signal Radio signal works when the post is completely buried in snow
 lekin yesignal divaais20 foot neeche tak kaa kisi bhi mobile yaa satellite phone kaa signal kaich kar saktaa he
 Radar EQUIPMENT can detect any thermal-signature, heat, or mattel below 20 feet
 bachaav dal ne sabase pehle vahaan jaakar medical sahaayta ke liye post taiyaar kiya
 The team then detected spots in the vicinity of the post where radio signals and special radars were stirring
 ek-ek kar sabhi spots ko baariki se khoda gaya
 Rock-drills cut the ICE-BOULDERS, the ice rock which is stronger than the wall or roof
 kai feet par bachaav dal ko arctic tents dikhaa darasal in khaas tarah ke tenton main hi 18000 kii fit main post taiyaar kii jaati hai
 In igloo, the soldiers stay for many months to save minus 40 degrees
 barf kaa bana hua ghar yani iglu aise gharon kaa istemaal antarctic main rahane vaale log karte hai
 But whenever the ITBP jawans protect the border in high altitude, they stay in such temporary shelters made of ice
 ye shelter ITBP ke jawan 4 se 5 ghanto main bana lete hai
 This is how it is made in the igloo, when the soldiers guard the border in an icy area, they stop at the border, where there are no permanent shelters, where they make temporary shelters and maintain the temperature inside
 phir iske andar 6 se 7 jawan apane hathiyaar ke saath kai dinon tak rah sakate hai
 It can be very difficult for common people to stay in this house made of snow, but these soldiers who protect the borders of the country live inside it
 khaane ke alaava hota he radimaid food or dry fruit
 In this house made of snow inside the snowflake, the soldiers have almonds, cashews, raisins, chocolate, butter, mix juice, oatmeal, biscuits, etc
 inside this igloo
 'snow kev' main karte hai araamjab hamen aaraam karnaa hota he to ham garm bistar dhundte hai par hamaare ye bahadur sipaahi desh kii raksha karne ke liye barf hi odhate he, vahi bichaate hai or usee kaa ghar hota he
 During duty, the seals have to stay in temperatures below zero
 vahaan par barf kii gupha banaakar desh kii raksha karte hai
 2 people can live inside this ice cave
 jawan sharir kii garmi se andar kaa taapmaana mentin karte hai
 Women commandos are no less than men
 a few months ITBP women commandos have been deployed at 15 posts along the india-china border
 jinaki dushmano par 24 ghante paini nazren rahengi
 These women commands are capable of facing every trouble
 ye mahila commandon hai altitude par mines taapmaana main desh kii sarhadon kii raksha kar rahi hai
 These women commandos are protecting the borders of the country by shoulder-to-shoulder with men and putting their lives in high altitude
 sarhad kii hifaazat karte vakt hoti he javaanon ko ye beemarisiachin or desh ke duusare ilaakon main bahut adhik barf he, jiske kaaran siachin main tainaat javaanon kii maut dushman kii goli se to kam balki kharaab mausam ke kaaran zyada hoti he
 In the last 12 years due to avalanches and bad weather, 900 army personnel have died in Siachen
 haalanki sirf siachin hi nahin jin jin ilaakon main ITBP tainaat hai vahaan bhi mines 40 degree tak taapmaana chalaa jaataa hai
 Due to which the soldiers doing duty there get diseases like hypo and gangrene and if their treatment is not done at the right time then the soldiers also die

 The egg is called a power house, as it contains all kinds of essential nutrients

 At the same time, some people consume only the white part of the egg to lose weight and make 6 pack abs
 aaie jaanate hai vajan kam karne ke liye andey kii zardi khaani chahie yaa nahin
 Does egg yolk harm health? An egg contains about 186 milligrams of cholesterol, which is present in egg yolk
 lekin ye sharir ko zyada nuksaan nahin pahunchaata he, kyonki sharir ko testosterone hormone banane main cholesterol kii jarurat padati he
 This increases energy in the body as well as strengthens muscles
 ek andey main kai prakaar ke nutrients paae jate hai
 Protein is found in plenty in its white part
 jabaki, duusare sabhi nutrients andey kii zardi main paae jate hai
 It contains iron, vitamin B-2, B-12 and vitamin D, which is not present in the white part of the egg
 isliye agar aap andey kaa sirf safed hissaa khate hai, to isamen maujuud jaruri nutrients aapako nahin mil paaenge
 a study by the University of Connecticut reported that the fat in egg yolk reduces bed cholesterol from the body
 agar aap vajan kam karnaa chaahate hai, tab bhi aap andey kii zardi kaa seven kar sakate hai

 input: bhashaa Assam is once again in the church for the wrong reasons
 vahaan bodo ugravadiyon ne 65 adivaasiyon kii goli markar hatya kar di jinamein zyaadaatar mahilaayein or bachche hai
 It is said that a separate faction of the militant gang National Democratic Front of Bodoland carried out this heinous massacre
 bataaya jaataa he ki unke do logsena-police se jhadapmein maare gaye the
 They have done this slaughtering to avenge it and to warn the government
 vah ilaaka jahaan 23 logon kii hatyaein huin, bhutan or arunachal pradesh kii seemaa ke paas he
 It is a very uninhabited area and there are more Adivasis settled here than in Jharkhand
 yahaan kisi kii hatya karnaa bahut aasaan he kyonki yah jagah suraksha balon ke ghere se dur he
 Taking advantage of it illegally, those killers killed innocent people
 unhone talibaniyon kii hi tarah chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa
 Assam is the most sensitive state in India
 vahaan hameshaa katleam hote rahete hai
 One of India's largest militant gangs, ULFA has also been active there for decades
 vahaan sesampradayik hinsa, jaateey hinsaur anya tarah kii hinsa kii khabaren aati rahati hai lekin rajya sarkaar or kendra ne kabhi bhi inase nibatane ke liye koi thos or doorgaami yojana nahin banaai
 The politics of vote kept his hands tied
 bangladesh se ghuspaith ke kaaran yahaan aksar khun-kharaba hota rahata he
 But Bodo militants have done a lot of violence in recent years
 uttari assam main rahane vaale log bodo kehalaate hai
 Bodo means big
 ek samay ve assam main ve dabe-kuchle nivasee the or unki jameen par baahar se aakar log basate ja rahe the jiske pratikaar main ve chhitput hinsa karte the
 He later voiced Bodoland for which the government created the Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts
 lekin isse bhi baat nahin bani, kyonki isse vahaan ke logon ko koi laabh nahin hua
 The militants formed their gang by bringing arms from abroad
 baad main uske bhi do tukade ho gaye or ek gut ab khun-kharaba kar rahaa he
 Regarding Assam, the Central Government will have to consider an expert committee to consider how this picturesque and beautiful state can be liberated
 yahaan kai jatiyon, dharmon, guton or nivaasiyon ke bich chali aa rahi dushmani ko khatm karne ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he, is bare main gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa hoga
 Just sending the army or security forces or capturing some militants will do nothing
 assam behad samvedansheel rajya he or uski samasyaayein bharat ke anya rajyon se alag hai
 Therefore, the problem there can be solved in a different way
 yah itnaa aasaan nahin he or iske liye gambhirtha se kaam karnaa hoga

 Tipu Sultan became an important issue in the Karnataka elections
 is mudde par rajya main teenon pramukh partiyon bijepi, congress or jedies ne vot batorne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 a total of 9 assembly constituencies of the present district of Sringarangapatna, Mysore, Coorg and Mangalore can be called Tipu Sultan's constituency and the ruling BJP at the center won a landslide victory on 6 of these seats
 vahiin congress ko 2 siton par jeet mili to kshetreey party jedies ko mahaj ek seat par apane ummidavaar ke liye samarthan mila

 Did Tipu Sultan become an issue in Karnataka elections? During the last five years, the ruling Congress Party in the state tried to remove Tipu Sultan from the pages of history and give it a nationalist image
 haalanki iske virodh main kendra main sattarudh or rajya main vipaksh main baithi bijepi ne iskaa jamkar virodh kiya
 In such a situation, the answer to the question whether Tipu Sultan became an issue or not in the Karnataka elections is answered by the voting of the people in the districts of these 9 assembly constituencies

 is jile main teen vidhansabha kshetra shaamil hai- mangaloru city north, mangaloru city south or mangaloru he
 These three seats were considered to be the strong fort of the Congress because since 2013, Congress has been consistently dominated by these three seats

 The entire program of the Women's Commission was a tribute to politics
 maliwal par FIR ke bahaane centre par nishanadrasal mahila ayog kii report jari karne ke liye kendriya mahila env bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi, kendriya griharajya mantri kiran rigiju, dipti siem manish sisodiya, swasthya mantri satyendra jain or jal mantri kapil mishra ek hi manch par asin the
 Therefore, the ministers of the Delhi government also targeted the Center on the pretext of FIR on Swati Maliwal, chairperson of the Women's Commission
 kapil mishra ne swati maliwal ko kyon di badhai?dilli sarkaar ke jal mantri kapil mishra ne ishaare hi ishaare main dilli police ko centre sarkaar ke mutabik kaam karne vaala bataaya
 Also during the forum address, Kapil Mishra said, 'as soon as i came to know that the Anti Corruption Bureau has filed an FIR against Swati Maliwal
 maine swati ji ko phone kiya or badhai di
 i said that the women's commission is doing a good job, so an FIR has been filed against you
 'angrejon kii tarah bartaav kar rahi police: jainmahila ayog ke manch par raajnneeti kaa kheldilli sarkaar ke swasthya mantri satyendra jainane bhi khelaa
 Jain said, 'I think we have reached the era of independence, where the police are acting like the British
 sarkaar chaahati he ki police ko power kii tarah istemaal kare, janata ko daraane or dabaane ke liye police kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 While the Supreme Court has also spoken about police reform, the government does not want to do police reform
 'swati maliwal ko janaa chahie jail: satyendra jainjain ne kaha, 'mujhase media ke kuch saathiyon ne poocha ki aapke logon par ek ke baad ek maamle darj ho rahe hai, aisa kyon, to maine kaha ki dilli main chunaav se pehle bhi aisa hi hua tha
 Now elections are in Punjab and Goa, so all this is happening
 mujhe lagata he ki ek baar sabhi 67 vidhayakon ko jail main band kar do, atyaachaar khatm ho jayega
 Satyendra Jain did not stop here, taking a dig at the central government over the FIR on Swati Maliwal, the Health Minister said that Swati Maliwal is doing a good job for women
 jain ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he unhen bhi ek baar jail chale janaa chahie
 'while Rijiju lauded the work of Maliwal, while the ministers of the Delhi government were targeting the central government, the Union Home Minister Kiran Rijiju confined himself around female security
 rigiju ne swati maliwal ke kaam kii tarif bhi kii or kaha, 'jab swati maliwal pehali dfa mahilaon kii samasya se jude kuch muddon par mujhane milane offis ain thim, to mujhe laga tha ki ye sach main kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 i have not yet read the Annual Report in full, but what i read in a nutshell suggests that work is being done for women
 'jab tak mahilaayein surakshit nahin, desh viksit nahin: rigiju2014-15 main mahilaon ke prati hue aparaadh ke cese badi sankhya main darj hue
 If there is a problem in society, it should be accepted
 badanaami ke bare main sochakar, usase munh nahin modana chahie
 If the mindset and society do not change, then the crime against women will not reduce
 main dilli police ko samay-samay par bataata rahata hum ki kya kadam uthaae jaaen lekin chintaa kii baat ye he ki mahilaon ke liye prati aparaadh main kami nahin ai he
 As a minister of the country, i feel sad that despite such efforts, there has still not been a decrease in crime against women
 jab tak mahilaayein yahaan surakshit nahin hoti, main is desh ko viksit desh nahin maanoonga

 But this time the BJP is presenting it as a weapon of women safety
 ghoshnaa patr ke baaki vaayadon kii tarah ye mudda bhi chand lamhon tak simata rahata
 But due to the increasing atrocities on women in the state and the increasing mob of manipulations outside schools and colleges, the party hopes to win the hearts of women voters

 The squad will consist mostly of women policemen
 haalanki bijepi ne mahilaon ke liye kai or saugaton kaa vaayada kiya he
 But most of the discussion is about the anti-romeo squad
 vaayade se khush aadhi aabaadilkhanu ke neshnal piji college main zyaadaatar ladkiyaan anti romeo squad ke idia kaa samarthan karti hai
 Troubled by roadblocks, these girls consider it a big decision
 isi tarah eke sen mahila college kii chatraayen or teacher bhi is mudde se ittefaq rakhte hai
 They believe that women safety is not possible until the mentality of men changes

 Describing a change in the government's thinking as very important, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that instead of hiding or covering the things of governance, he is trying to hand over such topics which the government comes to the forefront
 akashwani se prasaarit 'man kii baat' ke jariye modi ne kaha, main aise vishyon ko haath laga rahaa hum, jiske sambandh main sarkaar sabase pehle katghare main aati he
 How long will we keep things hidden
 kab tak ham parde ke peeche sab baton ko taalte rahenge
 At some point of time, you will have to buy a crisis for good intentions
 main bhi ye himmat kar rahaa hum or karata rahoonga
 He said, sometimes i think the country is far ahead, the government is far behind
 or jab main anubhav se kahata hum ki shaayad sarkaron ko bhi apni soch badalanaa jaruri he or main isliye kah rahaa hum ki main dekh rahaa hum ki yah yuva bharat khaas karke kuch na kuch karne ke liye kamited he, lalayit he, avasar khoj rahaa he or apane tareeke se kar bhi rahaa he
 Referring to black money, he said, as far as black money is concerned, my countrymen trust this 'pradhan Sevak'
 bharat ke garib kaa paisa jo baahar gaya he, vah pai-pai waapas aayega
 
 yah meri patibaddhta he

 arsh se farsh par pahunche ye rajanetakisi kaa gaya pad to kisi ne ganvaai pratishthasiasi garh bhi nahin bachaa paae kuch netasaal 2019 chunavi saal tha
 This year was very turbulent in terms of political activities, where some leaders traveled to the sky and some leaders collapsed on the ground
 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party phir ek baar satta ke sheersh par pahunch gai or amit shah ke rup main desh ko ek nayaa grih mantri mila jisane apane faislon se bharat kaa bhugolic or raajnneetik nakshaa hi badal diya
 For some politicians, this year was nothing short of a nightmare, let us know about some such leaders who reached the floor with haste this year
 rahul gandhiloksabhaa chunaav main congress party ko mili haar kii jimmedaari lete hue rahul gandhi ne is saal apana adhyaksh pad chhod diya
 Although the party wanted to retain him as president, after a long political struggle, Rahul finally resigned from the post of Congress president
 iske baad kuch din netritv viheen rahi congress kii kaman phir se sonia gandhi ke haathon main di gai jo philhal party kii antarim adhyaksh hai
 This year, Rahul Gandhi lost the traditional seat of Congress president to Amethi
 bijepi netaa smriti irani ne amethi main ajey maani jaani vaali congress ke suraj ko ast kar diya
 Rahul Gandhi had to face defeat in Amethi by 55120 votes which proved to be the biggest political setback for him
 haalanki do siton se chunaav ladane kaa faisla sahi sabit hua or is vakt rahul gandhi kerala kii vynad seat se loksabhaa main party kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai
 Along with the political defeat, Rahul Gandhi also lost in legal bets this year
 rahul gandhi ko chunaav prachaar ke dauraan die apane rafel vaale bayaan par supreme court main maafee maangani padi
 Not only this, he was reprimanded by the Supreme Court and has also been instructed to make a statement in front
 iske alaava salbhar vah manahani ke maamalon main desh kii alag-alag adaalaton main peshi ke liye jate rahe
 P
 chidambaramdesh ke grih mantri or vitt mantri rahe pi chidambaram ke liye yah saal sabase zyada kharaab sabit hua
 The leader, who used to speak in the UPA regime, had to live in the Tihar Jail for 106 days
 ienex mani londring cese main chidambaram se idi ne kai baar poochtacha kii or phir unhen nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya jiske baad kai apilon ke baavjood unhen jamaanat nahin mil saki
 Finally, on 4 December, the Supreme Court granted him conditional bail on the plea of chidambaram
 hiraasat main pi
 Chidambaram Chidambaram may have got bail in one case, but the sword of arrest is still hanging on him
 jaanch agenciyaan purv grih mantri ke khilaaf anya maamalon main bhi jaanch kar rahi hai or inamen phir se unhen poochtacha ke liye hiraasat main liya ja saktaa he
 However, after spending nearly three months in jail, Chidambaram attacked the government as soon as he came out and criticized the Modi government on the issue of economy to Kashmir
 devendra fadanavismaharashtra kii siyasat ke liye yah saal sabase zyada uthapatak vaala rahaa
 Devendra Fadnavis had to resign from the post of CM only 80 hours after becoming Chief Minister again
 bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko vidhansabha chunaav main bahumat hasil hua tha lekin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar donon partiyon kaa jhagada itnaa badha ki shivasena se bijepi se 30 saal purana naata tod diya
 After this, Fadnavis, who returned to power in Maharashtra, had to give up power due to lack of majority and Shiv Sena formed the government with the help of congress-ncp in the state
 devendra fadanvis ko bijepi main teji se ubharta netaa mana ja rahaa tha lekin satta paane kii jaldbaaji kaa daanv unhen ulta pad gaya
 He relied on Ajit Pawar, who had revolted from the NCP to form the government, who later retaliated
 is puure ghatnakram main bijepi ko na sirf satta se haath ganvaana padaa balki fadanvis ko kirakiri bhi jhelni padi
 Fadnavis, who submitted his resignation to the governor, first became the bjp's BS Yeddyurappa and then jd's HD Kumaraswamy as chief minister after dramatic political developments in HD Kumaraswamykarnataka last year
 haalanki is saal kumaraswami ko pad se istipha dena padaa or phir se soobe kii kaman yediurppa ke haath main aa gai he
 Kumaraswamy was the chief minister of Karnataka for only 14 months and the congress-jds coalition government could not prove a majority in the assembly due to the revolt of the legislators
 mukhyamantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad se hi karnataka main satta ke sahyogi congress or jedies ke bich main takaraar aam ho gai thi
 The Congress, despite being the number two party, gave the JD (S) the third party as the chief minister to stop the BJP
 iske baad se lagaataar congress kheme main kumaraswami sarkaar ke prati naaraazgi thi, jiskaa ant kumaraswami sarkaar girane ke saath hua
 This year also did not prove to be good for Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Congress leader and former minister from Jyotiraditya Scindia's Gwalior royal family
 loksabhaa chunaav main unhen apni paramparaagat seat guna se ek lakh se haar jhelni padi or unhen haraane vaala koi or nahin balki kabhi unke shagird rah chuke krishna paal yadav the, jo congress kaa daaman chhod bijepi ke tikat par maidan main utre
 Scindia was a four-time MP from this seat, not only this, his father Madhav Rao Scindia had also been a four-time MP from Guna, but this time he had to lose his stronghold
 sindhiya ko loksabhaa chunaav main priyanka gandhi ke saath upi main congress ko badhat dilaani kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 He was made effective in western UP, where the party was swept away
 upi main congress ko sirf ek seat mili, vah bhi sonia gandhi kii raibareli seat thi
 Scindia, considered close to Rahul Gandhi, has now moved away from Delhi and has confined himself to Madhya Pradesh
 navjot singh siddhuhameshaa vivaad main rahane vaale netaa ke taur par pahchaan bana chuke navjot singh siddhu ko is saal ek saath kai jatke jhelane pade
 Not only did his political stature decrease, he also suffered professional losses due to controversies
 punjab kii congress sarkaar main mantri banane vaale siddhu ne is saal july main apane pad se istipha de diya
 Captain Amarindan Singh first changed his department, after which Sidhu left the post without taking charge
 navjot singh siddhusiddhu ko pakistan or imran khan kii dosti baari padi jiskaa nuksaan unhen kai morchon par uthaanaa padaa
 Sidhu, who is playing the role of a judge in Kapil Sharma's comedy show, was relieved of this responsibility by Sony TV
 saath hi imran khan kii tarif ko lekar unhen virdohi party bijepi hi nahin balki apano se bhi aalochana hi mili
 At present, Sidhu's political future is in balance and he seems to be far from the party's activities
 jayant sinhamodi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main mantri banakar surkhiyaan bantorne vaale jayant sinha kii chamak is saal feeki hi rahi
 He won from Hazaribagh Lok Sabha seat but failed to get a place in the cabinet
 pichhali sarkaar main vah vitt rajya mantri or nagar vimaanan mantri rahe the or unke kaam ko saraahna bhi mili, baavjood iske modi 2
 Jayant Sinha was kept out of the government in 0
 pichhali sarkaar main arun jetali ke junior mantri ke taur par sinha ne vitt mantralay main kaam kiya tha
 He is also credited for starting an aerial scheme like Udaan while being the Minister of Aviation

 The company has indicated that it is not interested in setting up a plant in Odisha
 plant ke liye posco ne 2,700 acre jameen maangi thi
 The Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (OIAIDC) had given 1,800 acres of land
 or 900 acre milti, isse pehle hi posco ne man badal diya
 Since 2005, no work other than land acquisition and transfer has been started

 The villagers do not want to let the land of their forefathers go into the hands of a foreign company at any cost
 isse pehle, 2014 main nuagaanv main posco ke asthaayee site offis main aag laga di gai thi
 Protests are constantly intensifying, the outrage of the local people in Jagatsinghpur can be gauged from the fact that the number of farmers protesting against the Posco Steel Plant has increased very fast in the last ten years
 govindpur se shuru hue posco virdohi hajaaron andolankariyon par 230 mukademe darj kiye ja chuke hai
 Residents of the place where the steel plant was selected are not ready to leave their ancestral land under any circumstances

 On April 23, a case of illegal abortion came to light in a clinic in Gwalior
 iske do hi din baad 25 april ko shahar ke ek anya ilaake main portable ultrasound mashin se garbhvatee mahila ke bhrun ke ling pareekshan kaa maamla ubhara
 There are 140 registered ultrasound clinics in gwalior-chambal area
 in par sarkaar active trekar naam kii mashin ke jariye najar rakhti he
 Due to government surveillance, the area was getting increasingly difficult for the gender testers
 aise main in logon ne china main bani portable altasound mashin kaa istemaal shuru kar diya
 This was revealed when a person named Kapil Pandey was caught doing sex tests in a house in Saraswati Nagar
 aaropee ko range haath pakadaaey ke liye mahila or bal vikaas vibhaag ne ek mahila ko nakli grraahak banaakar yahaan bheja tha
 That seven thousand rupees
 lekar pareekshan kar hi rahaa tha ki gwalior ke colector pi
 Narhari raided here
 yahaan se portable ultrasound mashin baraamad hui
 In another incident, a woman was being miscarried at the Happy Clinic located in Gola Ka Mandir area of gwalior as the fetus in her belly belonged to a girl
 yah nursing home dilip mishra naam ke kathith jholachhap doctor kaa he
 When the administration team conducted the raid, a nurse named Suman was going to abort the woman
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki mishra ne muraina ke kai kasbon main apane agent tainaat kar rakhe the
 These people underwent gender tests and when the girl was in the womb, the woman was sent to the clinic in Gwalior, Egypt for abortion
 is bare main narhari kehete hai, ''in maamalon main pre-concepshan and pre-netal diagnostic techniks act ke tahat karrwai ho rahi he
 "they do not deny the connivance of the Health Department in such cases, but say," The administration raided in both incidents first
 swasthya vibhaag ko soochna baad main di gai
 This happened several times when the Health Department was sent to take action but its officials came empty handed
 ''gwalior-chambal main ek hajaar ladakon ke mukaable keval 831 ladkiyaan hai, jabaki pradesh main yah aankada 912 he
 According to Suresh Tomar, joint director of the Women and Child Development Department, the main reason for illegal abortion in the area is the presence of a girl in the womb
 ve kehete hai, ''salbhar pehle nursing homes kii ultrasound mashiinon ko active trekar se joda gaya he
 Now the record of every ultrasound is kept
 pehle ek saal main 32,000 ultrasound darj hote the, ab inaki sankhya 73,000 paar kar gai he
 The portable ultrasound machine is undermining the state government's efforts to stop fetal testing
 is mashin ke choti or sasti hone ke kaaran is dhandhe main lipt logon ke liye ab ling pareekshan karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 The ultrasound machine fitted in the clinic costs a million
 se shuru hoti he jabaki china main bani portable ultrasound mashin mahaj do lakh ru
 It merges into rajya sarkaar ke paas in portable mashiinon ke panjiyan kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 Nor is there any way to track these
 ye mashine dilli se laai jaati hai or agent bade hi gopneey tareekon se inhen farji doctoron ko dete hai

 " Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has changed his strategy regarding the 2019 general elections
 'aap' netaaon or raajnneetik paryvekshakon kaa kahana he ki 2019 ke aam chunaav ke liekejarivalane pradhanmantri narendramodipar hamalon kii apni ranneeti main badlaav kar liya he
 In 2017, Kejriwal decided to reduce the intensity of his attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the aap's poor performance in Punjab and bjp's sweeping of other parties in Uttar Pradesh
 kejariwal ek saal se adhik samay tak apni is ranneeti par kaayam rahe, lekin haal main bijepi kii kai chunavi haar or centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf dhire - dhire 'bad rahi' satta virdohi lahar ko dekhte hue kejariwal ne ek baar phir modi par apane hamalon kii dhar tej karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 a senior AAP leader said that Modi's charisma was intact when Kejriwal changed his strategy in 2017 after the Uttar Pradesh election results
 aap aise netaa par hamale nahin karte jo lokapriy ho kyonki uskaa ulta asar hota he, lekin ab jab vah (modi) alokapriy ho rahe hai to ranneeti badal gai he
 He said that due to the increase in petrol and diesel prices, the anger of the people against the Modi government, the defeat of the BJP in the recent by-elections and the opposition's unity against the BJP has changed the strategy
 haal hi main loksabhaa kii 4 seat ke liye hue upachunaav main bijepi ke khate main sirf ek seat ai thi
 At the same time, out of the 10 by-elections in the assembly seats, only one seat was won in his bag
 iske baad kejariwal ne saavdhaanee ke saath ek twit kar purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii tarif kii thi jinhen unhone 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan apane bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan ke tahat nishaanaa banaaya tha
 After that during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too, Kejriwal had targeted Manmohan
 modi par hamalaa bolte hue kejariwal ne kaha tha ki log manmohan singh jaise 'shikshit pradhanmantri' kii kami mahasoos kar rahe hai
 After the by-election results, Kejriwal had said that the results showed people's anger against the Prime Minister
 raajnneetik vishleshak sanjay kumaar ne kaha ki jab koi netaa lokapriy ho tab us par hamalaa karne kaa ulta asar hoga
 Now that the opposition is uniting against Modi, when the by-election results show an anti-incumbency wave, he (kejriwal) is seeing an advantage and he is attacking
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik 'aap' kii dilli ikai ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki kejariwal manushya hai or vah javaabi hamalaa karenge hi

 Following the threat of the underworld, Sunil released a song on the occasion of 'gutthi', the release of 'gutthi' film
 gane main sunil rinku bhabhi bane hai, jo apane pati se shikaayat kar rahi hai ki unke pati unase pyaar nahin karte
 It is a comedy song
 gane ke bare main sunil ne kaha, 'main kuch dinon se yah gaanaa relies karnaa chahta tha
 Which day could have been better than Women's Day, to release this song
 yah gaanaa bharat bhar kii shaadishuda auraton kii maansikta ko dikhaata he
 You also see this song: prakhyat samajasevi anna hajaare ne kaha ki jis soochna ke adhikaar kanoon (artiai) ko unhone lard kar banwaaya tha, vah kanoon aaj kamjor ho gaya he
 He directly attacked the central government
 anna ne kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ne artiai kanoon ko kamjor kar diya he
 The game of power and money is going on in his mind
 isliye unhone tay kiya he ki23 marchako kisaanon kii pramukh maangon ko lekar dilli main karo yaa maro andolan karenge
 Addressing the workers at Charkha Samiti, the residence of JP in Patna, Anna said that i have been agitating for 35 years
 soochna ke adhikaar ke liye hamane 8 saalon tak ladaaiyaan ladi or ant main yah kanoon bana
 People are also getting a lot of benefits from this
 isse hamen kaaphi khushi milti he
 Annane said, you will remember that in Delhi, we sat on fast for only 16 days on water and in the end the government had to shout
 kanoon to ban gaya he lekin yah ab thik se kaam nahin kar rahaa he, logon ko suchanaaen nahin mil rahi hai
 He said, whichever commission is under the control of the government like Agricultural Price Commission, Election Commission, NITI Aayog and other such commission should take away government control and get constitutional status
 anna ne kaha, aise kisaan jiske ghar main aay kaa koi strot nahin he, unhen 60 saal baad 5000 hajaar rupee kaa pension milanaa chahie
 The government should pass the Kisan Bill in Parliament because our constitution gives everyone the right to live

 But, his team has also come with full preparation this time
 rohit ne kaha ki tej pichon par khelnaa utana aasaan nahin hoga
 He said, 'india has always played in Perth or Brisbane
 in donon maidaanon par halaat chunauteepurn rahete hai or australia ke lambey gendbaaj halaat kaa puraa phayda uthaate hai
 Rohit said, "indian batsmen are generally not that tall and hence it is not easy for us
 lekin, ham puri taiyaari ke saath chunauti kaa saamana karne aae hai
 "rohit said," It is challenging for our batsmen
 lekin, adhikansh khilaadi pehle australia kaa daura kar chuke hai or halaat se waakif hai
 Their bowling will be challenging for us in every format, but as a batting unit we are also ready
 ’viraat nahin, team india ke is ballebaaj se khauf main hai kangaroo khiladithin maichon kii tii-20 siries ke baad bharat ko chaar maichon kii test or teen maichon kii vanade siries khelni he
 India has not yet won a Test series in Australia
 teen siries drow rahi or aath main use paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Rohit admits that his performance in the limited overs format is good, but his biggest challenge is Test cricket
 philhal vah is bare main nahin soch rahe hai or unka dhyaan tii-20 siries par he
 Rohit said after the practice session on Gaba, 'playing outside India feels different and we all want to do well in Australia
 pichhali baar hamane yahaan kuch kareebi match khele the
 'he said,' We want to win this time with the best performance
 australia main achche pradarshan se manobal badhata he or vishwa cap se pehle jeetne se hamaara aatmavishvaas kaaphi badhegaa
 'no improved Australia, now this bowler made Kohli as well as the wannabe also said that all players will have to play well against a strong team like Australia
 unhone kaha ,‘ australia ko australia main haraana kaaphi mushkil he
 In such a situation, you have to do your best as a unit
 hamaare paas behtareen gendbaaj khaskar spinner hai, jinase ham australian ballebaajon ko kadi chunauti denge
 Rohit played 57 matches in 16 matches against Australia in Australia
 50 kii ausat se 805 ran banaae hai
 He said the bounce and pace of Australian pitches helps him
 unhone kaha, ‘maine yahaan vanade cricket kaa puraa majaa liya he
 a good bounce in cities like Brisbane and Perth gives me the opportunity to play my natural game, because i have played indoors on cement pitches
 ’ Team India's star fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar believes that getting an 'extra bounce' in the three-match series against South Africa is a good change, but bowling with a red Kukabura ball will be challenging
 agency ke mutabik kal do shift main hue shuruuaati abhyaas satr ke baad bhartiya team ne aaj western provins cricket club main hawa or nami bhare mausam ke kaaran indor abhyaas kiya
 Indian fast bowlers are still focused on bowling long spells as they will have to bowl in the long spell throughout the series since the first Test starting in Newlands on January 5

 But still it is not sure what kind of pitch you will get in the match
 'bhubaneshwar ne kaha, ‘jab ballebaajon kii baat hoti he, to oochaal se nipatna kaaphi ahm he
 But, it is also important for bowlers
 kukabura se gendbaaji karnaa sabase kathin he
 It does not do much after 25-30 overs, so we are trying to prepare according to such circumstances
 'bumraah se or nahin hota intjaar, debyue se pehle hi daali WHITE jerseybhubaneshwar ne kaha ki 'tej gendbaaji akraman ne abhi match ke liye ranneeti bananaa shuru nahin kiya he or unka dhyaan lambey spel kii gendbaaji karne par laga hua he
 "the swing specialist bowler said," We have not yet talked about the plan
 hamaara dhyaan sirf basics par laga hua he
 "bhuvi said," Maybe two days before the start of the first test, we will do it
 ham dekhenge ki ballebaajon ke anusaar kaise ranneeti banaaen
 Yesterday, we had two practice sessions to get into the rhythm of the test
 'team india ko fark nahin padataa ki vah kiske khilaaf khel rahi he: shastriunhone kaha, 'test match main chah ghante kaa khel hoga isliye hamane do baar gendbaaji kii
 We wanted to bowl as long as possible
 ' bharat ne dakshin africa main abhi tak koi test siries nahin jiti he, lekin pichley do saal se team kaaphi acha khel rahi he
 Bhuvneshwar feels that with the current form, his team has a good chance to improve their record in South Africa

 manivannan kehete hai, ''banta hua vipaksh, lachar teesraa morcha, diemke ke prati logon kii dharna or chunaav prabandhakon ke jariye paise se vot khinch lene kii kshamta par bharosa—ye sab milakar jayalalita ke liye sakaaratmak sthitiyaan bana rahe hai
 The money-buying factor can be decisive by giving money as 60 crore so far

 Ironically, when the Supreme Court applied for a restriction that it was illegal to distribute things for free, he dismissed the petition saying that this work is similar to the Directive Principles of State Policy

 Perhaps this is the reason Jayalalithaa is avoiding the populist race this time, but the DMK manifesto has a total of Rs 70,000 crore

 From the years 1914 to 1918, three continents Europe, Asia and Africa fought this war on all three sides of the earth, sky and water
 is pehle vishwayuddh ke 101 saal baad bhi visheshgy iskaa pataa nahin laga paae hai ki aakhir ye yuddh shuru kisne kiya tha

 kareeb 52 maheene chale is yuddh main kareeb aadhi duniya isaki chapet main aa gai thi
 What was India's role at the time when the first world war took place, Britain was ruling in India, it was obvious that India had to fight for Britain itself
 us daur main likhe gaye tathyon kii maane to is yuddh main britain ne 10 lakh bhartiya sainikon ko bheja tha

 People here thought that Britain might free the Indians on their side to fight and win
 lekin afsos aisa hua kuch bhi nahin
 Those memories are recorded at India Gate, after the first World War, the British government awarded 9200 Indian soldiers with gallantry medals
 sarkaar ne is vishwayuddh main shahid hue 74 hajaar bhartiya sainikon kii yaad main dilli main 1921 main india get kii aadharshila rakhi thi jahaan aaj bhi kareeb 13300 se zyada un shaheedon ke naam darj hai, jinhone desh ke liye praan die the

 maheene bhar ke andar bijepi ko doosraa bada jhatka laga he
 Sushma Swaraj passed away earlier this month
 jetali or swaraj kii apni-apni khubiyaan thim
 When Arun Jaitley was a minister in the previous Narendra Modi-led government, he would often be seen as a troubleshooter of the government
 masalaa koi bhi ho, jetali ke paas jawaab jarur hota
 When the opposition put the Modi government in the dock on an intricate case like Rafael, Arun Jaitley appeared before the defense minister to answer these attacks
 or bhi kai aise maukey aae, jab jetali ne sarkaar kii ukhdati saans ko 'oxigen' di
 However, it is also true that Jaitley started his political innings in student life
 apatkaal main jail bhi gaye, lekin ve kabhi 'jananetaa' nahin ban paae
 In his political innings of more than 4 decades, he once contested the Lok Sabha elections, but faced defeat
 iske baavjood jetali kii chamak kabhi feeki nahin padi
 At a time when many of the leaders accompanying him went backstage or were pushed, despite this Jaitley kept asking till the end
 is saal loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle jetali ne swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue khud koi pad lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The news came that all the BJP leaders urged him to consider this decision
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi unase is masale par baat kii
 However, Jaitley's declining health did not allow him to
 arun jetali aakhri vakt tak party main 'ahm' rahe, isaki kai vajahen thim

 During his political innings, he did not let the 'political cruelty' come to him
 centre kii pichhali sarkaar main videsh mantri rahete hue unhone saat samandar paar based bharatiyon ke andar vishwaas paidaa kiya ki ek twit par desh unke saath khadaa he, unki dukh-takalif sun rahaa he
 There were also occasions when Sushma Swaraj herself faced criticism from several leaders of her party and was trolled on social media, but on every such occasion her heart was seen as 'big'
 ab sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali donon nahin hai
 Along with him, there was also an era of 'heart and mind' leaders
 mohali main aaj bharat or australia ke bich hone vaale tii-20 mukaable se thik pehle purv nirdhaarit pich ko badal diya gaya he
 These changes were made following the request of the Indian team management

 BCCI sources confirmed that according to Hindustan Times, BCCI sources have confirmed that Team India was requested to change the pitch before the match on Sunday
 jise management ne sweekaar kar liya or match ke liye pich ko badal diya gaya
 Team India made the request, according to the news, if there was to be a match between India and Australia in Mohali on the same pitch on which Pakistan and Australia had
 lekin team india is pich par khelnaa nahin chaahati thi or jiske baad ab pich ko badal diya gaya he
 The strength of the BCCI is that the ICC curators prepare the pitch for matches like World Cup
 haalanki mohali main pich badalane ko lekar sawaal bhi uth sakate hai ki aakhir team kii maang par pich kyon badla gaya? lekin bisisiai kii world cricket main takat kisi se chuphi nahin he
 The ICC also realizes the power of the BCCI
