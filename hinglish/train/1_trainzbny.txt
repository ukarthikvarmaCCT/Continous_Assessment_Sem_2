 ) BJP candidate from Nitesh Rane Kankavali seat was opposed by Shiv Sena against Nitesh, Shiv Sena launched its candidate in the midst of Maharashtra Assembly elections, an interesting picture has come out, which is also becoming viral on social media
 bhartiya janata party ke tikat par kankavali seat se chunaav lard rahe nitesh rane rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) kii shakha main baithe hue dikhaai de rahe hai
 This picture is from Deogarh in Sindhudurg district
 dilachasp baat ye he ki nitesh rane shakha ke dauraan ek aam swayamsevak kii tarah baithe dikhaai de rahe hai
 On one side, the RSS volunteers are sitting in their traditional attire, while Nitesh Rane is seen in his barbar
 nitesh rane ke saath unke kuch samarthak bhi baithe hue hai
 However, Nitesh Rane is not in the dress of the Sangh like the RSS volunteers
 wo apane kapadon main yahaan baithe dikhaai die
 The picture of Rane, a political politician of the picture, sitting on the ground in the RSS branch and listening intellectually is becoming increasingly viral
 nitesh rane apane pita or purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke saath shivasena or congress se hote hue apane pita kii party swabhimani party main rah chuke hai
 In 2014, Nitesh Rana contested from Kankavali seat on a Congress ticket and won
 is samay unke pita narayan rane bhi congress main hi the, lekin 2017 main narayan rane ne congress se alag hokar swabhimani party bana lee
 Narayan Rana merged his party with BJP and in 2018 BJP sent him to Rajya Sabha
 tikat milane se pehle bijepi main aae niteshanitesh rane ke liye bhi unke pita bijepi ke tikat kii maang kar rahe the
 But the politics was quite hot when the names came in the first two lists
 ek taraf shivasena nitesh rane ke tikat kaa virodh kar rahi thi to duusari taraf bijepi ke kaaryakarta bhi unki ummidavaari se khush nahin the
 Bajwood was given a ticket to Nitesh Rane just before the last date of his nomination
 shivasena kaa virodh itnaa zyada he ki usne nitesh rane ko bijepi kaa tikat hone ke baavjood apana pratyaashee utaar diya he
 That is, Nitesh Rane may have got the BJP ticket, but he is facing vocal opposition from the ally Shiv Sena, while the BJP leader-activist is also not completely happy with him
 mana ja rahaa he in tamaam halaaton ke chalate hi nitesh rane aresas kii sharan main pahunche hai
 On this step of Nitesh, his father Narayan Rane has said that now the Rane family is in BJP, so it is important to learn and understand RSS
 isiilie nitesh kaa aresas kii shakha main janaa swaabhaavik he

 wo har baar skool jaataa
 Every time in school, a girl placed her hand on the head and the girl was picked up from school the next moment and brought to her harem
 jahaan uski haisiyat sex kii bhukh mitaanevaali ek gudiya se zyaada kuch nahin hoti
 Two and a half years after the death of Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the story that has come out of his harem is shocking
 skool se haram tak40 saal tak libya ko raundne vaale libya ke taanashaah karnal gaddaphi ko skulon main jane kaa bada shauk tha
 Just excuse anyone
 wo skool pahunch jaataa
 Libya knew this thing completely
 par gaddaphi kii maut ke baad ab jab unheen skulon main padhane vaali ladakiyon ne apana munh kholana shuru kiya to puraa libya sann rah gaya
 The secret of Gaddafi's hobby of going to school was revealed
 ji haa, logon ko ab pataa chalaa ki skulon main karnal gaddaphi ke kisi ladki ke sir par haath rakhane kaa matlab kya hota tha
 Gaddafi used to put a hand on the head
 jo ladki use acchhee lagati uske sir par wo haath rakh detaa tha
 Gaddafi's guards knew the meaning of the gesture
 ishaara milte hi usee rose ladki ko uthaa liya jaataa or phir ladki pahunch jaati gaddaphi ke haram main
 Gaddafi went to school thousands of times during his reign
 kabhi samaaroh ke naam par to kabhi udghaatan ke naam par
 What is this hobby of a dictator? This heart-wrenching truth has once again come out of Libya's former dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's harem
 julmo-sitam kii kaalikh main duba wo haram jahaan har rose skool kii ladakiyon ko agava kar laayaa jaataa tha
 The girls were decorated and were forever enslaved to Gaddafi
 ek ishaare se foot gai suraiya kii qismatnam suraiya
 Age 15 years
 libya ke sirte kii rahane vaali 15 saal kii is ladki muammar gaddaphi ke julm kii wo kahani duniya ke saamne laai he, jise sunakar kisi kaa bhi kalejaa kaanp jaae
 Suraiya was seen by Gaddafi at a school function in 2004 and put his hands on his head
 ladki ke sir par haath rakhane kaa matlab tha ki ladki ko gaddaphi ke haram main janaa hoga or duusare din suraiya ko gaddaphi ke haram main bhej diya gaya
 Gaddafi's blessings: Actually, Gaddafi's henchmen used to pick up Kamaşin girls for Gaddafi's berths on the pretext of talent hunt in Libyan schools, colleges
 or ladki chunane ke baad use haram main bhejne se pehle wo us ladki ke khun kii jaanch karte the, taaki ye pataa chal sake ki wo kisi beemaari kaa shikaar to nahin he
 After this, the girl was sentenced and sent to Gaddafi's bedroom
 bacchiyon ko dikhain blue filmenitna hi nahin, gaddaphi ke haram main nai ladakiyon ko uskaa sex slave banane kaa kaam bhi ek aurat hi karti thi
 Yes, Gaddafi had entrusted this work to a woman named Razdar Mubaraka
 mubaraka in maasoom bacchiyon ko ashleel filmein dikhaane kaa kaam karti thi
 Girls who refused to do so were punished with a terrible punishment
 main tumhaara papa hum
 
 bhai hum
 
 tumhaara lover hum
 
 ye alphaz us sanakee taanashaah gaddaphi ke hai, jo din-raat bas sex ke nashe main duba rahata tha
 Which was crazy about aphrodisiac drugs
 gaddaphi kii in khoonkhaar or sharmnaak harkaton kaa khulaasa hua he 'in gaddafeez haram' naam kii ek kitaab main
 And Enik Kozian has written this book
 anic ke mutabik, jo bhi gaddaphi ke haram se nikali ladakiyon kaa sach sunegaa wo sharmasaar ho jayega
 Yeh daastan rooh kampa degaenik has also written the story of 18-year-old Huda in his book
 huda kii kahani bhi suraiya se juda nahin he
 Gaddafi placed a shameful condition in front of him to make Huda his harem
 shart ye ki agar huda gaddaphi ke haram main aati he to uske bhai ko kaid se reeha kar diya jayega
 Gaddafi's mind was filled with the insanity of sexsex so much that the security guards around her were beautiful women and they also enhanced the dignity of her harem
 apni ayyashiyon ke liye gaddaphi ne tripoli uniwarsity main ek gupt thikaana bhi bana rakhaa tha
 In 40 years Gaddafi's Ayyashi and oppression forced the Libyan people to raise their voice against him
 vaise gaddafi kii taanaashaahee main sabase ahm kirdaar mahilaon kaa rahaa
 The list of Gaddafi loyalists included none other than women
 jitna beraham, utana hi ayyash
 The more savory, the more eccentric
 jitna faujee, utana hi darpok
 This was the identity of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi
 haal hi main vikiliks ne gaddaphi kii ajibo-garib duniya kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Like Gaddafi, 69-year-old Gaddafi lived as a nurse of Ukraine descent, named Galina Kolotnietzka
 sirf galina ko hi gaddaphi ke puure routine kii jaankaree rahati thi
 Gaddafi was fond of keeping his bodyguard to the gunned women, known as the Killing Machine
 unki sankhya 40 ke aasapaas hoti thi
 In another country too, he lived in special tents with his female bodyguards and private nurses
 sarkari kaamkaaj bhi wo apane shahi tent main hi nipataata tha
 Gaddafi did not forget to take camels with him for milk anywhere
 darpok tha gaddafikhun bahaane se kabhi bhi naa hichakane vaale gaddaphi ko oonchaaiyon se dar lagata tha
 He used to avoid flying over water and once he had to stay in the hotel, he preferred to stay on the ground floor
 nihathe pradarshnakariyon or dushmano ko thikaane lagane ke liye bhaade ke gundon ko saath rakhana gaddaphi kaa purana shagal tha
 At the age of just 27, Gaddafi had a bloodless revolution to overthrow the pro-western King Idris
 ek kisaan parivaar main janme gaddaphi par satta kaa nasha aisa chadha ki apane liye usne pahadiyon ke bich ek aisa bunker banwaaya, jis par parmaanu bamon kaa bhi asar naa ho
 And luxurious so that all the facilities of the world can be achieved, but if the mercury of the people rises, then looted that Bunkerunuma palace too
 karnal gaddaphi ne libya main khud ke chupane or ayyashi ke liye aisi-aisi bhul-bhulaiya vaali jagah bana rakhi thi, jahaan tak pahunchnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Gaddafi ran the secret of terror on the Libyan land for 42 years and built his own intelligence base under the ground
 ayyashi kaa adda
 Gaddafi's bunkers have been found since the rebels took over the capital of Libya, but one bunker is the largest and most isolated, which Gaddafi used for his recital
 tripoli ke purvi hisse ke yeraba street ke neeche mili is bunker ko pehle gaddaphi ke bete mutassim kaa adda mana ja rahaa tha, lekin jab is bunker ke neeche vidrohi ghuse to yahaan kii duniya dekhakar har koi hairaan rah gaya
 After the way this bunker was built, everyone is saying that Gaddafi himself would live in this bunker sometime
 doodh jaise safed rang se bane is mahal kii khubsuurati kisi ko bhi apni taraf khinch sakati he
 It has all the comforts of swimming pool as well as luxury
 gym, sonaabath, behtareen furniture, shandaar painting, mahangi sharaab kii bottlen
 The sea looks very beautiful outside the glass wall
 ye mahal jitna zamin ke upar bana he uske kahin neeche basii he ek rahasyamayi duniya
 Gaddafi and his son's bunker is no less than a James Bond den
 is bunker kii deevaaren majboot kancreet kii 10 feet moti parat se bani hai
 Here many paths open from one side
 ye dushman ko chakma dene ke liye bhul bhulaiya kii tarah basaaya gaya
 This bunker has got fifty full rooms, in which the whole five hundred people can live
 is bunker main sone ke liye kamare hai, meeting ke liye kamare hai, kitabon se bhare kamare hai or hathiyaaron se bhare kamare bhi hai
 The most shocking is a hospital built in this bunker
 ji haa yahaan puraa aspataal bana hua he
 Hospital in Bunker
 marij ke liye bistar hai or doctor ke liye clinics
 Mutassim Gaddafi himself is a doctor, that is why it is believed that he will have the mind to build a hospital inside the ground
 is aspataal ko banane ke peeche makasad ye bhi he ki agar gaddaphi parivaar kisi hamale main ghayal ho jaataa he to dushman kii ankhon se dur yahaan uskaa ilaaj chal sake
 It is certain that Mutassim must have lived in this palace and bunker, because here he has got pictures of his French girlfriend who is a model by profession
 lekin jis tarah se is mahal ke neeche jis tarah se parmaanu hamale se bachaane vaala bunker mila he use dekhakar lagata he ki ye karnal gaddaphi kaa sabase khufia or nayaa adda rahaa hoga, lekin jab tak vidrohi yahaan pahunchate wo or uskaa betaa yahaan se bhaag chuke the
 The truth is that there is no one else responsible for making Gaddafi a dictator, he has his own wife and children and his illegitimate desires
 gaddaphi ke bivi-bacchon kii daulat kii bhukh or julmon ne hi aam logon ko use goli maarane par majaboor kar diya
 Neither the intimidation of the 42-year-old rule came to fruition, nor the fear of the military boots of this dictator, nor did he come to work for whom this man had been robbing Libya for four decades
 jisaki ijaajat ke bagaiyr libya main parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa tha, usee libya ke apane hi shahar main karnal muammar gaddaphi ko jindagi bheekh main bhi nahin mil paayi
 When the public was disillusioned with Libya's King Idris, his voice emerged as Gaddafi, 28 years old
 us bhari tarunai main bhi logon ne apni takadir gaddaphi ke haathon main saunp di thi
 But in his own and his wife's children, Gaddafi forgot that the hands which have the power of coronation, those hands also take off their heads when needed
 gaddaphi kii nirankush taanaashaahee or uske bivi-bacchon kii lut-khasot uske nirmam ant kaa kaaran bana
 To keep the petroleum occupied, Gaddafi had given the contract to export oil to one of his sons, Innibal Gaddafi, while a son was looking after all the exports of the country
 gaddaphi kaa ek betaa mohammad gaddaphi doorsanchaar kaa maalik tha to ek betaa muatssim gaddaphi to rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar
 Through the corruption of their unbridled sons, Gaddafi & Family looted assets worth millions of crores
 bataaya jaataa he ki gaddaphi ke paas kareeb 7 billian dollar yani 350 arab rupee kaa to sirf sona hi tha
 Gaddafi's wealth in different countries of the world is estimated at $ 168 billion, or Rs
 8400 billion
 or isi daulat se ek taraf gaddaphi or uske bete-betiyon kii ayphashiyaan badhati gayi or duusari taraf logon kaa aakrosh
 Gaddafi's dictatorship was consumed in the fire of this anger
 gaddaphi ke beton par aarope he ki apane baap kii tarah wo bhi behad ayyash the
 Gaddafi's bodyguard women are also alleged to have raped her several times by the dictator and her sons
 jab unka man bhar jaataa tha, to wo bhala-bura kahkar un mahilaon ko chhod dete the
 While Gaddafi's wife Safia and daughter Ayesha were busy in collecting gold and silver
 jab gaddaphi kaa sitara gardish main fansaa to donon hi use chhodkar algeria bhaag gayin
 The family to which Gaddafi looted Libya for the sake of comfort, that family was devastated by it and there was no one to save Gaddafi at the last moment

 These days a discussion of a popcorn seller in Pakistan is on the cards
 aapako isaki lokapriyata kaa andaja isi baat se ho jayega ki vahaan kii air force bhi us popcorn vaale kii kaayal ho gai he
 Yes, here we are talking about Muhammad Fayyaz, who made a plane for himself, even from the minor things around him
 fayyaj ne hai-faai chizon se nahin balki road kattar ke ingine or rickshaw ke maamuli pahiyon se plane banane kaa karnama kiya he
 Mohammad Fayyaz is one of the millions of people in Pakistan who have little access to education and who struggle for opportunities
 yahi vajah he ki uski kahani ne pakistani awam kaa dil jeet liya he
 According to Fayyaz, who created the plane by watching TV clips and online blueprints, "when i first flew the plane i made, i was really flying in the air
" iske alaava mujhe or kuch mahasoos nahin hua
 "stories with such scientific achievements are nothing new in Pakistan
 isse pehle saal 2012 main vahaan ke ek ejeeniyar ne kaha tha ki usne aisi gaadi banaai he jo pani kii madad se chal sakati he
 However, later his claims were called hollow by scientists
 lekin fayyaj kaa daawa he ki usne vaaki main plane udaaya or airforce ne uske daawey ko gambhirtha se bhi liya he
 According to him, people of the Air Force have come to meet him many times and even issued a certificate praising his work
 fayyaj ke banaae plane ko dekhne ke liye dur-dur se log uske ghar pahunch rahe hai
 Fayyaz also sits in the open courtyard of his three-room house in Tabur in Punjab province, showing people his plane with great enthusiasm
 32 saal ke fayyaj kaa kahana he ki bachapan main vah air force jwoin karne ke sapane dekhtaa tha
 But when he was in school, his father died and he was forced to leave school in VIII
 uske baad apni maa or paanch chote bhai-bahanon kaa pet paalane ke liye use chote-mote kaam karne pade
 Fayyaz's dream of flying in the air did not change even when he grew up
 uske paas jo kuch bhi hota tha usase vah plane banane kii koshish karne laga
 He would sell popcorn during the day and work as a guard at night
 is tarah wo pai-pai jod rahaa tha
 He had to first gather information to make a plane
 iske liye usne jeography channel par prasaarit 'air krash investigeshan' program dekhnaa shuru kiya
 Then he also took the help of internet
 iske baad usne parivaar kii jameen kaa ek tukdaa bech diya or phir ek enjio se 50 hajaar rupee kaa lone le liya
 With these money he bought the goods
 plane ke purje kabhi kaam karte to kabhi nahin
 Sometimes there was a need to change some accessories, sometimes there was a problem in wiring
 fayyaj ke parivaaravale uski sanak se pareshaan the
 Her mother Mumtaz Bibi says, "I used to refuse her again and again
 main usase kahati thi ki wo apane parivaar or kaam par dhyaan de
 But he did not even hear a word
 "fayyaj rukaa nahin or aakhirkaar use plane banane main safalataa mil hi gai
 He made a small and delicate plane
 usne plane ko dark nile rang se rang diya
 According to him, after two years of ridicule, he was fully ready to fly in February this year
 uske kuch doston ne ek sadak block kar di jiskaa istemaal usne farvari main apni pehali udaan ke liye ranve ke rup main kiya
 According to eyewitness Amir Hussain, "the plane reached a speed of 120 kilometers per hour before taking off
 " amir hossain kaa daawa he ki vah plane ke saath-saath bike par daud rahaa tha
 According to him, "the plane was two or two and a half feet above the ground
 landing se pehle vah do se teen kilometre tak uda
 "after this success, Fayyaz's conspirators got wings and thought of flying a plane in front of the villagers who had been making fun of him for so many years
 usne is kaam ke liye 23 march kaa din chunaa
 Hundreds of people had gathered to see what was there then
 kai logon ke haathon main pakistan kaa jhanda tha
 But before Fayyaz could start the engine, the police came there and arrested him
 fayyaj ke mutabik, "mujhe aisa laga jaise maine duniya main sabase kharaab kaam kiya ho yaa maine koi bada gunaah kar diya he
 i was locked up with criminals
 "court ne use teen hajaar rupee ke muchalke par reeha kiya
 However, when Fayyaz's story started going viral on social media, it did not take him long to become a hero
 khabar he ki pakistan air force ke pratinidhiyon ne fayyaj se mulaakaat kii he or uske junun or 'mini basic air plane' banane kii uplabdhi kii saraahna karte hue use ek certificate bhi diya gaya he

 Major newspapers in Pakistan have deeply regretted that the indo-pak foreign minister-level talks did not yield any results and promised to continue the dialogue
 desh kaa sabase purana dainik akhbaar ‘don’ likhata he ki pakistan or bharat kisi baat par raji nahin ho sake
 The 'no Found No Shared Land' headline writes that the pakistan-india dialogue to build trust ended at a deadlock as the two sides did not reach a clear roadmap by mutual agreement on confidence-building measures
 ‘nahin hui tarakkee’ shishark se ‘don’ ne likhaa he ki kuraishi-krishna kii baatcheet se koi nateeja nahin niklaa lekin ‘or baatcheet kaa ek vaada’ jarur hua
 The paper writes that the talks failed, not because it lacked the necessary momentum, but because India did not agree on a specific roadmap for future dialogue, while Pakistan wanted the issues of Jammu and Kashmir and Siachen to be included
 duusari ore ‘da news’ ne bharat-paak videsh mantri stareey vaarta ko apane sampadakeey main sahi disha main uthaaya gaye ‘chote chote kadam’ bataaya he
 The newspaper writes, "it is no surprise that the two leaders sat opposite each other and spoke in a different manner
" wo chaahate the ki unki kahi kisi baat kaa koi galat arth nahin nikaale
 Nevertheless, what he said was very little and there was not much scope to misunderstand it
 ’’akhbaar likhata he ki gaur se dekhen to kuch sakaaratmak chihn hai, pehla yah ki donon ne ummid se zyada samay tak vichaar vimarsh kiya, jo is baat kaa sanket he ki unhone ek agenda ke saath teble par baithne kii kam se kam taiyaari to kii he

 narendra modi ne lagaataar duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee
 58 ministers including PM Modi were sworn in on Thursday
 inamen 24 cabinet, 9 swatantra prabhaar ke saath rajyamantri or 24 rajyamantri shaamil hai
 In view of the assembly elections of Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand this year, these three states have been given special preference in Modi's Union Cabinet
 maharashtra se aath mantrimodi sarkaar main maharashtra se aath mantri banaae gaye hai, jinamein se chaar ko cabinet or chaar ko rajya mantri banaaya gaya he
 From BJP quota, Nitin Gadkari, Prakash Javedkar and Piyush Goyal have been made cabinet ministers
 jabaki shivasena ke cote se arvind saavant ko cabinet mantri banaaya gaya he
 Rao Saheb Danve, Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao and v Muralitharan have become ministers of state from BJP quota
 jabaki bijepi kii sahyogi dal arpiai se ramdaas athavle rajyamantri bane hai
 However, eight ministers were appointed from Maharashtra in the previous cabinet of the Modi government
 bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ne is baar loksabhaa chunaav main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 BJP has won 23 seats and Shiv Sena 18 seats in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main do maheene baad vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 This is the reason why the state has been given special importance in Modi cabinet
 haryana main teen mantrimodi cabinet main is baar haryana se teen mantri banaae gaye hai
 Of these, Rao Inderjit Singh has been made Minister of State (independent Charge)
 iske alaava krishnapal gurjar or ratanlal cateria rajya mantri bane hai
 This time, the BJP has taken care of the Gurjar, Yadav and Dalit equations in the cabinet, playing the non-jat stakes in Haryana
 haryana main do maheene ke baad hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Therefore, BJP wants to retain power once again with the stakes of non-jats
 jharkhand se do mantrimodi cabinet main jharkhand ko khaas taur par tavajjo di gai he
 Two cabinet ministers have been appointed from the state, including Arjun Munda and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 nakvi jharkhand se rajyasabha sadsy hai
 While Munda has won the Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki isse pehle jharkhand se do mantri banaae gaye the or donon rajyamantri the
 Assembly elections are due in Jharkhand after two months
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki pradesh se do cabinet mantri banaae jane ke peeche vidhansabha chunaav ke chalate khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya he
 In Jharkhand, the Chief Minister is headed by a non-tribal, so in the Modi cabinet, an attempt has been made to create caste equations by replacing Arjun Munda as the tribal face
 gujarat, karnataka se teen mantrimodi cabinet main 29 rajyon main se 22 ko pratinidhitiv mila he
 a total of three ministers including Amit Shah have been made from Gujarat
 karnataka se bhi teen mantri bane hai
 Rajasthan, which won all 25 seats, has also got three ministers including one cabinet minister
 punjab se teen or kerala va assam se ek-ek mantri banaae gaye hai
 One minister each has also been appointed from Uttarakhand and Delhi

 yojanaon ko lagu karne ke liye vishesh praavdhaan kiya jayega
 Bundelkhand Development Board will be formed, from which the report will be taken every week
 piem modi ne kaha ki aaj basapa party kahaan se kahaan pahunch gai
 When on November 8, when i came on TV and said that the big people who looted the poor, the thousand and 500 notes will have to be returned to the poor
 jab maine notebandi kii or sapa or basapa jo ek-duusare ke ghor virdohi hai, ek saath milakar notebandi kaa virodh karne lage
 The comments mayawati par kataaksh karte hue piem modi ne kaha, bahan ji ne kaha ki notebandi ko lekar puri taiyaari nahin kii thi
 The government did not or you did not
 notebandi se zyada pareshaani inhen is baat kii he ki inhen taiyaari karne kaa mauka nahin mila
 Now the name of BSP has changed, Bahujan Samaj Party is no more

 haryana or maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav agar desh ke sabase ubaau or neeras chunaavon main se ek kahe ja rahe hai
 In both the states, the opposition is neither able to keep its word properly nor is there any mutual unity between the opposition parties
 haryana main jahaan bich chunaav main hi congress se netaaon kaa jane kaa silsilaa jari he to maharashtra main bhi ensipi netaa sharad pavaar paariwarik jhagade main uljhe hai to congress main sanjay nirupam or milind devda jaise netaa baghawat kaa bigul phoonk chuke rahe hai

 haalanki maharashtra main bijepi ke saath milakar chunaav lard rahi shivasena jarur kuch bayaan dekar halchal machaati dikh rahi he or bijepi thodaa asahaj si ho ja rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP has promised in Maharashtra's election manifesto that VD Savarkar will be given 'bharat Ratna' if the party returns to power again
 is vaade kii khaas baat yah he ki piem modi bhi ab bhaashanon main saavarkar kaa zikr kar rahe hai

 iske saath hi bijepi ko jat aarakshan andolan ke baad rajya main badale samikarnon ko bhi anuchhed 370 se sadhana chaahati he
 There is also the issue of awarding Bharat Ratna to Savarkar
 maharashtra main maratha aarakshan andolan fadanvis sarkaar jhel chuki he or rajya main sharad pavaar maraathon ke bade netaa hai
 Through Article 370 and VD Savarkar, BJP is trying to create a wave of nationalism among the Marathas
 vahiin congress in donon hi baton par rukh saaf na karnaa hi behatar samajhati he
 That is why in Haryana, Bhupendra Singh Hooda says that a new law has been made by removing Article 370, so everyone should respect it

 aaj hi release hui he, 'commando', jisamen mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai vidyut jamwaal, jayadeep ahlavat or puja chopra
 
 
 'commando' is the story of a 'commando', who is trapped in China during a helicopter crash and the army captures him as a spy
 
 
 udhar, apane desh kii sena raajnneeti kii vajah se use bachaa nahin paati or 'commando' karanvir singh dogra par laga diya jaataa he, aatankwaadi hone kaa thappa
 
 
 On the other hand, there is a terror of a goon in the village of Punjab, named AK-47 (AK-74), played by Jaideep Ahlawat
 
 
 eke-47 sthaneey netaa kii beti simrit, yani puja chopra se jabardastee shaadi karnaa chahta he
 
 
 Meanwhile, 'commando' Vidyut Jamwal, who has been a prisoner for a year, manages to escape from the confinement of China, and collides with Pooja Chopra, who is in fear of AK-47
 
 
 or phir shuru hota he ghamaasan, 'commando' karanvir singh dogra or eke-47 ke bich
 
 
 There is no doubt that the film has been thought and written keeping in mind the training of electrical martial arts, as its stunts are worthy, but the story of the film did not get much attention
 
 
 film kii kahani puraani or kamazor lagati he
 
 
 The comments vidyut jamwaal ke kuch dialog achche hai, or eke-47 ke kirdaar main jayadeep ahlavat ne bhi behtareen kaam kiya he
 
 
 The songs seem to be forced
 
 
 film main kahin-kahin bajet kii kami bhi nazar aati he
 
 
 Some characters also look fake, but the stunt scene of Vidyut saves the film
 
 
 mere mutabik yah film puri tarah vidyut or jayadeep kii hi he
 
 
 If you want to see some good stunt scenes, you can watch 'commando'
 
 
 meri taraf se is film kii reating he - 2
 5 stars
 
 
 duusari ore, punjab ke gaanv main ek gunde kaa aatank failaa hua he, jiskaa naam he - eke-47 (AK−74), or yah kirdaar nibhaayaa he jayadeep ahlavat ne
 
 
 AK-47 wants to forcefully marry Pooja Chopra, the daughter of local leader Simrit
 
 
 is bich, ek saal tak kaidi bana rahaa 'commando' vidyut jamwaal china kii kaid se bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he, or takaraata he eke-47 ke dar se bhaagi hui puja chopra se
 
 
 And then begins the skirmish between 'commando' Karanvir Singh Dogra and AK-47
 
 
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki film ko vidyut ke marshall arts kii training ko dhyaan main rakhkar sochaa or likhaa gaya he, kyonki uske stant kaabil−e tarif hai, lekin film kii kahani par zyaada dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 
 
 The story of the film feels old and weak
 
 
 tippaniyan Vidyut Jamwal has some good dialogues, and Jaideep Ahlawat in the AK-47 character has also done a great job
 
 
 gane jabardastee daale gaye maaloom padate hai
 
 
 There is also a lack of budget at some places in the film
 
 
 kuch kirdaar bhi nakli lagate hai, lekin film ko bachaate hai vidyut ke stant seen
 
 
 According to me, this film is entirely of Vidyut and Jaideep
 
 
 agar aap kuch achche stant seen dekhnaa chaahate hai, to 'commando' dekh sakate hai
 
 
 i have a rating of 2 for this film
 5 star

 Even a professional acrobat cannot do such action with his feet
 wo bhi bina kisi ke notice kiye
 Why they didn't call the air hostess
 yaa anya seat se uthakar kyon nahin gayi
 Or why not ask that person to stay with Tamizh
 yah tamaasha keval landing ke baad hua
 'this case is very fishy
 How can a man sitting behind a woman in a plane caress a woman's back with his leg?even professional acrobats can't accomplish such feat-that 2 without anyone noticing
 Why didn't she call airhostess or get up & ask him to behave? Tamasha only after landinghttps: / / t

 police ne mere pati ko giraftaar kiya he
 i want to ask that when all this happened to Zaira, why did he not take up this matter? Why did she tweet after 2 hours? 'zaira reached the event after the flight molestation case-' Stop following me 'the airline gave this to the team of Vistara Airlines and Zaira regarding the incident of flirting with the actress in the Dalflight k has come out with his own voice
 airlines kaa kahana he ki landing ke dauraan is ghatana kii shikaayat karne kii baat kahi lekin aisa karne ke liye jaayra or unki maa ne manaa kar diya

 vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ne apane antarrashtriya adhyaksh chunaav ke liye gurugram main taiyaari kar puri lee he
 This election on Saturday is also special because for the first time after 52 years, the election for the post of president is being held, along with Praveen Togadia's bad relationship between BJP and RSS, everyone's eyes are on the next president
 adhyaksh ke liye hone valechunaavake liye 273 matadaata apana vot daalenge
 Before the election, Togadia has alleged that there are 37 fake voters in the VHP voter list
 haalanki parishad ke mahaamantri chanpat raay ne saaf kiya ki praveen togadiya ke saath aae kuch bahari logon ne viechpi ke daftar aarake puram main aakar dhakka-mukki kii or chunaav ko baadhit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 They allege that this was done so that people coming from outside get confused and cannot vote in the elections
 chunaav par sawaal uthaanaa galatchampatrai kaa yah bhi kahana he ki yah suchi vahi he jo samay-samay par hone vaale chunaavon main vot daalati rahi he or praveen togadiya or raghav reddy bhi is suchi ke bare main jaanate hai
 He too has seen this list many times, so it is not right to question it
 chanpat raay kaa kahana he ki chunaav shantipurna honge
 No one is confused or excited under anyone's pressure
 chunaav thik dhang se honge
 This election to be held on Saturday is very special because BJP and Sangh are also eyeing it
 vajah saaf he kipraveen togadiyake pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath rishte thik nahin chal rahe hai
 From time to time, he has been critical of the Modi government
 isliye bijepi or sangh nahin chahta he ki 2019 ko dekhte hue praveen togadiya vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya adhyaksh bane kyonki agar vah adhyaksh ban gaye to sarkaar ke liye thik nahin hongetogadiya ke modi se rishte thik nahintogadiya jis dhang se vibhinn nitiyon ko lekar kaamon ko lekarsarkaar par sawaluthate rahe hai
 He will not be cured by 2019
 yah baat togadiya bhi acchhee prakaar jaanate hai ki unka adhyaksh bananaa bahut mushkil he
 Not only this, Raghav Reddy also does not like BJP and Sangh
 isliye unase bhi adhyaksh pad dur ja saktaa he
 It is being asked to keep an eye on the entire election that senior officials of the Sangh will also be present there
 togadiya is vakt vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hai or raghav reddy adhyaksh hai
 The tenure of both has ended last year
 togadiya vishwa hindu parishad ke phir se adhyaksh bananaa chaahate hai, lekin modi ke saath talkh rishton ke kaaran aisa hona sambhav nahin dikh rahaa
 While Raghav is also scheduled to leave
 vishwa hindu parishad ke nae adhyaksh ke rup main ve kokeje pehali pasand bataae ja rahe hai

 Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor have publicly accepted their relationship
 haalanki, donon ne apni shaadi ko lekar abhi koi khulaasa nahin kiya he
 But during an interview, Malaika Arora said that if both of them get married then she will not hesitate to tell this
 trinmul congress (tiemasi) or telugu desham party (tidipi) main sansad bhawan main ek kamare ko lekar vivaad chhid gaya he or donon paksh is kamare par apana daawa kar rahe hai
 The reason for the controversy is the room number-5 on the first floor, which has been with the TDP for many years
 lekin beete 6 agast ko ise mamata banerjee kii party ko aavantit kar diya gaya tha
 The TDP has been given a room on the third floor of the Parliament House, although the Andhra Pradesh party, which has been using Room Number-5 for the last 30 years, does not intend to vacate the room
 chandrababu naidu kii tidipi ke sadasyon ko jab somvaar ko pataa chalaa ki unke netaaon kii nemplate room ke baahar se hataa di gai he, to party ne is sambandh main loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ko patr likhaa
 On Tuesday, tmc's Sudeep Bandopadhyay, Kalyan Banerjee and Sultan Ahmed arrived in the room and put their nameplates outside it
 unhone dopaher kareeb 2:30 baje kamare main kuch der ke liye baithak bhi kii, lekin kareeb aadhe ghante baad tidipi ke saansad vahaan pahunche or unki maujuudagi main unki party ke netaaon wies choudhary, tii narsinhan or siem ramesh kii nemplate vahaan dobaaraa se laga di gayi
 Chaudhary said that he would meet the Speaker of Lok Sabha regarding this behavior of TMC members
 choudhary ne kamare ke vivaad ke sambandh main kaha, ‘trinmul congress ke asaanskrithik ravaiye ke kaaran aisa hua he
 When asked about this development, TDP Lok Sabha member Narayan Rao said, 'we have this room for the last 30 years
 kuch nemplate hataa di gayi
 It is not democratic
 ’unhone kaha ki party ke loksabhaa or rajyasabha main 25 saansad hai
 Rao said that members should follow the rules laid down by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and removing the nameplate is not democratic
 loksabhaa sachivalay main nideshak dies malha dwaara jari aavanton patr main kaha gaya he, ki sakasham praadhikaar kii manjuuri ke anusaar room number-5 16veen loksabhaa ke kaarykaal ke liye trinmul congress ko aavantit kiya gaya he

 koyala ghotaale main dilli kii special sibiai court se doshi qaraar jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa kii sajaa par sunwaayee 16 disambar tak taal di gai
 Madhu Koda is also convicted along with former Central Coal Secretary HC Gupta
 gupta ne ye tathy chupaaya tha ki ek kol block ko screening cameti ne jharkhand sarkaar ke jariye alot kiya tha, jabaki koyala mantralay kii ore se iskaa anumodan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Gupta also hid this information from the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 aisa hi kuch manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main hi unke tatkaaleen pradhan sachiv tii ke e nair ne bhi kiya tha
 Nair had done the allocation of coal blocks to the group associated with Sansadvijay Darda
 unhone is kol block ko aavantit karne kii jaankaree manmohan singh ko nahin di thi jabaki us vakt koyala mantralay kii jimmedaari unheen par thi
 The Ministry of Coal was in the hands of the Principal Secretary! India Today has access to the ML Sharma Committee Report which contains many surprising facts
 jaise ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh 2G yaa koyala ghotaalaa main kuch bhi galat kaary se khud ko dur rakhane ke liye itane utsuk the ki unhone apane paas maujuud koyala vibhaag kii puri jimmedaari apane pradhan sachiv tii ke e nair ko saunp di thi
 Many such surprising facts are included in the ML Sharma Committee's report which was submitted to the Supreme Court earlier this year
 supreme court ne somvaar ko koyala ghotaale kii jaanch karne vaali sibiai kii esaiti (vishesh jaanch team) se chaar hafte main silband lipaphe main report maangi he
 All this information from the SIT will be included in its report which will be submitted to the Supreme Court
 em el sharma cameti kii report ke mutabik ek kol block jo saansad vijay darda ko aavantit kiya gaya tha wo vastav main tii ke e nair ne manjuuri di thi
 The report said that the file related to this coal block was not sent to the Prime Minister
 is tarah kii baat ko sarkari bolchaal main karypalika kii shaktiyon kaa purna ulanghan mana jaataa he
 Manmohan Singh was also the coal minister when the coal block was allotted
 sheersh sibiai adhikariyon ke mutabik kol blox ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ke pradhan sachiv kii ore se aavantit kiye jane ke maamle kii nae sire se jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The files have been inspected and it appears that the coal block allocated to the AMR group was not by the Prime Minister but by an officer posted in the PMO
 file par pradhanmantri yaa unki ore se kisi ne dastakhat bhi nahin kiye the
 These are some of the many issues that are now being investigated afresh
 'dow
 Manmohan Singh did not respond: a Nair of realityt told India Today, refusing to speak anything on the issue, "the factual position is present in the relevant files which may be available from the PMO and the Ministry of Coal
" is sambandh main jab dow manmohan singh se pratikriya leni chaahi to email or phone colls kaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 Let us know that the ML Sharma Committee was constituted by the Supreme Court to investigate the case related to former CBI chief Ranjit Sinha
 jaanch kaa ek bindu ye bhi tha ki kya sinha ke awaas par aane vaale visitors ne sibiai kii jaanch ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The visitors' entry register kept at Sinha's house saw multiple signatures of many such persons, whom the CBI was investigating
 supreme court ne sibiai ke purv vishesh nideshak em el sharma ko jaanch kaa jimmaa saunpa tha ki kya in visitors ne koyala ghotaale kii jaanch ko prabhavit kiya
 The AMR case is related to the alleged fake claim of the group in which it was said to be part of the Lokmat Group with a net worth of Rs 1821 crore
 isaki ore se koyala mantralay ko apane aavedan main ye bhi kaha gaya tha ki uske paas pehle se koi kol block nahin he jabaki hakeekat main ise purv main 5 kol block aavantit ho chuke the
 Despite being pointed out by the junior officers of the ministry for these irregularities, the then Coal Secretary HC Gupta (the first bureaucrat appointed as the plaintiff in the case) believed the claims of AMR Group
 isamen tatkaaleen koyala rajya mantri santosh bagrodia ne push karne kaa kaam kiya
 Bagrodia had reached Sinha's house 46 times
 vahiin vijay darda sinha ke ghar par teen baar or darda ke bete 12 baar pahunche the
 Incidentally, this was the time when Sinha had to take a decision to close the case against Darda and Bagrodia

 Especially at a time when BJP has demanded Bharat Ratna for Savarkar and Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray has supported this demand
 bataa den ki hindutv jaise mudde par shivasena kii vichaardhaara congress or ensipi se puri tarah viparit he
 Congress is against giving Bharat Ratna to Savarkar while Congress is against giving Bharat Ratna to Savarkar
 rahul gandhi aise kisi bhi prastaav kaa joardaar virodh kar chuke hai
