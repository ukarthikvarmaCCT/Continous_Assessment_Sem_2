 On an average, about 160 to 170 lakh tonnes (1451-1541 lakh quintals) of onions in the country produce 20% of the world's total production in India

 The third batch comes in the Rabi season which accounts for 50-60 per cent of the total annual production and arrives in the market between March and May

 lakhanu or varanasi charchaa menvaise modi ko lakhanu or varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladaane kii charchaa party main sabase zyada he
 Lucknow is the seat of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 agar modi yahaan se khadey hote hai to isse yah sandesh jayega ki vah vaajapeyi ke nakshe-kadam par hai
 But Lucknow's caste equation is not in favor of Modi's image
 yahaan ke 30 fisadi muslim voter modi kii raah mushkil bana sakate hai
 If Modi chooses the second option i

 Varanasi, then the party will benefit greatly
 party kaa maananaa he ki agar modi is dharmik sthal se chunaav ladate hai to upi kii 20 seat or padosi rajya bihar kii kuch siton par iskaa asar padegaa
 But the problem is that Varanasi is the stronghold of senior party leader Murali Manohar Joshi
 joshi apni seat ko nahin chhodana chahenge
 Those close to Modi want Joshi to leave Varanasi for Modi and contest from Kanpur

 Apart from damage to apple farmers due to snowfall, power supply has been completely disrupted in many parts of the state

 Although 80 percent of the power supply has now been commissioned in Srinagar, the surrounding areas are still immersed in darkness

 The issue of nation and nationalism comes to life in TV debates
 ankaron kii bhashaa generalon se bhi zyaada aakraamak ho jaati he
 Boss in the office and after reaching home battling traffic on the road, you also want something hot on TV
 kuch chahie kii ye talab shiksha yaa chikitsa jaise vishyon kii charchaa se kahaan puri hoti he
 One head will change and you will die once you hear the slogan of fifty heads
 patrakaron main bhi bhay samaa gaya he, unase koi puch nahin rahaa he, phir bhi twit kar apane rashtrawaad kaa pradarshan karne lagate hai jabaki unheen channelon par din bhar kuch aise kaarykram chalate rahete hai jinka sambandh raashtra nirmaan se kitna hota he, aap behatar jaanate honge
 The army, the border and Pakistan give a good opportunity to the journalists disappointed with journalism, to renew their credit license
 isliye ham ankar jor-jor se raashtra ke prahari ban jate hai
 Instead of talking in the language of TV channels, there is a demand for gunpowder, the announcement of 'fifty heads instead of one head', 'kabil sahe sahega Hindustan', understand the embarrassment of the editor, he has forgotten that at the time of surgical strike How proud he was
 ham patrakaron ko sahi main kisi dawa kii zarurat he, shaayad baba ramdev ke atyaadhunik lab main isaki koi dawa ho
 Today the Director General of Military Operations of India spoke to the Director General of Military of Pakistan on the hotline
 is baatcheet ke baad jo press relies di gai he uski bhashaa main tivi channelon kii barudi bhashaa kii tarah nahin he
 The press release stated that the DGMO of the Indian Army has expressed serious concern over the incident on 1 May in the Krishna Valley sector
 isi jagah par niyantran rekha ke bhartiya hisse main pakistan kii tukdi ne ghuskar bhartiya gashti dal par hamalaa kiya or do javaanon ke shavon ko kshat-vikshat kar diya
 Pakistan's army gave full support from behind
 bhartiya sena ke dijiemo ne niyantran rekha ke kareeb pakistan kii bat tranning shiviron kii maujuudagi par bhi chintaa jataai he
 The DGMO also stated that such inhuman action is beyond any decency and deserves strong condemnation and reasonable response
 jinhen is masale se nipatna he, unki bhashaa main gambhir chintaa or chintaa he
 Look at the language of the anchors and channels that do not have to deal with this issue
 kya aapako apni sarkaar main vaaki bharosa nahin he ki wo kuch nahin karegi
 Will governments now have to run according to the disgraced public opinion created by TV channels
 pakistan ne jo kiya he, uskaa na to bachaav kiya ja saktaa he or na hi chup rahaa ja saktaa he
 Such a situation in india-pakistan relations comes every month after two months, where after reaching many times, we do not understand what to do now
 yahi vajah he ki ham ankar badbadaane lagate hai
 TV becomes cannon
 hamaari raajnneeti bhi tivi kii jubaan main baat karne lagati he
 TV is not only fighting your leaders, it is also making you like that
 ankar netaaon ko ladaa bhi rahe hai or bol bhi rahe hai jab tak shaheedon kii chita jal rahi he tab tak raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 See the innocence of this politics in the language of that anchor
 upie banaam endie ke samay main aatankwaadi hamalon or javaabi karrwai ke aankade ubhar aae hai
 Comparisons between the two governments have started as to who was better
 2011 se 13 ke bich upie ke samay 270 baar sizafire kaa ulanghan hua tha
 Between 2014-16, there have been 349 violations of ceasefire at the time of NDA
 2011-13 ke bich upie ke samay sizafir ke ulanghan main 17 jawan shahid hue
 Between 2014-16, 27 security forces were martyred at the time of NDA
 is tarah aatankwaadi hamale main 2011 se 13 ke bich 108 sainik shahid hue jabaki endie ke samay yani 2014-16 ke bich 180 suraksha bal shahid hue hai
 These data are taken from the South Asia Terrorism Portal
 haal hi main kupwada main ek sainya shivi par aatanki hamalaa hua
 Captain Ayush Yadav and two soldiers were martyred
 aatankwaadiyon ne bank kii cash vine par hamalaa kar 50 lakh rupee lut liye or jammu kashmir police ke paanch javaanon ko maar diya
 Why did it not come to such a boil then
 jammu-kashmir ke halaat ye hai ki anantnag loksabhaa kshetra main upachunaav ke liye chunaav ayog ko 70,000 suraksha bal kii maang kerani padati he

 somvaar ko bhi grih mantri rajnath singh ne ek ucchstareey baithak kii thi, jisamen NSA ajit dobhaal ke alaava IB cheef, CRPF ke diji or grih sachiv shaamil hue the
 Is Pakistan provoking India? haal hi main pakistan ke senadhyaksh bajva ne seemaa kaa daura kiya or kaha ki jammu kashmir main chal rahi gatividhiyon ko pakistan raajnneetik samarthan degaa
 Is Nawaz Sharif's hold on power getting weaker, this news of beheading came when the Turkish President was visiting the Prime Minister on his visit to India
 mujhe pataa he ki abhi bam barood or badla jaise jumalon ke alaava kisi or lahaze main sunne kaa logon kaa mood nahin he phir bhi ham ajay shukla or sushant sareen ke saath samajhane kaa prayaas karenge ki unke jaays gusse ke alaava sarkaar ko kya karnaa chahie tha jo nahin kar rahi he
 If the government has to attack, then it should take the decision of the TV anchors in confidence, and not make excuses for those who talk about it
 vaise bhi bahumat main wo nahin hai jo baatcheet kii baat karte hai, unki sankhya itani he ki ve parshad kaa chunaav bhi nahin jeet sakate
 Listened to many anchors, if they cannot surround the government, then they have begun to surround those talking about the talks
 tivi channelon kii bhashaa main baat kii jagah barood kii maang he, 'ek sir ke badale pachaas sir' kaa elaan he, 'kab tak sahegaa hindustan' jaise jumale dekhakar sampadak kii sharmindagi samaj aati he, wo bhul gaya he ki sargical strike ke vakt use kitna garv hua tha
 We journalists really need some medicine, maybe it has some medicine in Baba Ramdev's state-of-the-art lab
 aaj bharat ke military oparation ke mahanideshak ne pakistan ke military mahanideshak se hotline par baat kii
 The language of the press release given after this conversation is not like the landmine of the TV channels
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki bharat kii sena ke dijiemo ne krishna ghati sector main 1 may ko hui ghatana par gambhir chintaa zaahir kii he
 At this place, a Pakistani contingent entered the Indian side of the Line of Control and attacked the Indian patrol and mutilated the bodies of two soldiers
 pakistan kii sena ne peeche se puraa saport diya
 The DGMO of the Indian Army has also expressed concern over the presence of Pakistan's bat training camps near the Line of Control
 dijiemo ne yah bhi jataa diya ki aisi amanviya karrwai kisi bhi shaleenta ke paar he or yah kadi ninda or makul jawaab ke laayak he
 There is serious concern and concern in the language of those who have to deal with this issue
 jinhen is masale se nahin nipatna he un ankaron or channelon kii bhashaa dekhiye
 Don't you really believe in your government that it won't do anything
 kya sarkaron ko ab tivi channelon ke banaae badahavaas janamat ke anusaar chalanaa hoga
 What Pakistan has done can neither be defended nor kept silent
 bharat-pakistan sambandhon main aisa padaav har maheene do maheene baad aa jaataa he, jahaan pahunch kar kai baar samaj nahin aata ki ab kya kiya jaae
 This is the reason why we start babbling anchors
 tivi top ban jaataa he
 Our politics also starts talking in the tongue of TV
 tivi aapke netaaon ko hi nahin ladava rahaa he, aapako bhi vaisaa hi bana rahaa he
 Anchor leaders have been fighting and speaking even as long as the pyre of martyrs is burning, politics should not happen
 aap us ankar kii bhashaa main is raajnneeti kii maasoomiyat to dekhiye

 i am Ravish Kumar! Car companies often bring back all the cars sold when one of their model's head lights go bad
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main admician ke liye intjaar kar rahe kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ko pataa hi nahin he ki agle 24 ghante main ve kis course main admician lene vaale hai
 Those who are studying right now have the same condition
 raaton raat course badal lene kaa karishma hazaron saal se duniya main gyaan kaa deepak jalaane vaala bharat nahin karegaa to koun karegaa? This year, the Government of India, named UPA Two, gave Padma Shri to Vice Chancellor of DU, Dinesh Singh, for his contribution to a remarkable level in the field of education
 One of the many notable contributions of DU has been the illegal formulation of the implementation of the new curriculum of DU
 is course ko aap epaviupi ke sankshipt naam se pukaarte hai
 Technically, this instruction has been issued by the UGC
 magar raajnneetik rup se yah bijepi ke dilli ghoshnaa patr kaa hissaa bhi he ki satta main aate hi epaviupi samaapt kar diya jayega
 So while working on Sunday, the UGC sent a letter to the principals of DU to finish the course and take admission in the course of three years instead of four years
 ujisi ne dilli ke akhabaaron main bhi notice chhap diya, taaki aam janata bhi bakhbar ho sake
 The UGC has now come to know that a course called FYUP is not compatible with the National Education Policy
 saal 2013 main ise lagu karne ke liye dilli university act 1922 kaa anukaran nahin kiya
 Under which the ordinance of the course, the permission of the visitor is mandatory
 vahiin diu kii daleel he ki raashtrapati kii anumati ke liye file maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko bheji gai thi or niyam ke anusaar ek maheene tak raashtrapati kaa jawaab nahin aata he to ise anumati ke rup main maan liya jaataa he
 The UGC has said in its order that the college which will not follow it will be considered against the UGC Act 1956
 chaar saal se teen saal ke pathakram main jane kaa kya taur tarika hoga, iske liye ujisi ne ek standing cameti bana di he
 The decision is that the cut-off list will not come on Tuesday
 somvaar ko khalsa kalege main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke 66 college ke principalon kii baithak hui jisamen yah faisla kiya gaya
 Principal fraternity says that DU and UGC have different orders before them
 aaj maanav sansaadhan mantralay main ujisi ke adhikariyon ke saath baithak hui
 According to sources in the ministry, the Ministry of Human Resources will not interfere
 ye ujisi or diu ke bich kaa maamla he
 Institutions can work in India only with such neutrality and devotion
 khayr somvaar ko maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kaa is babat chaatr hit main koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 Not even on Twitter
 ek baithak ujisi kii standing cameti kii bhi hui isame shikshak or chaatr sangh ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 It has also been alleged on the Vice Chancellor of DU that he implemented the course in haste and agreed to the decision in all the councils under pressure
 lekin in aaropon kaa dinesh singh har str par jawaab dete rahe hai
 But on Monday, he did not speak the whole day
 yah bhi nahin kaha ki ve ujisi ke faisle ke khilaaf adaalat main jaaenge yaa vishvavidhyalay ko ujisi kaa faisla maananaa hi padegaa
 An old news has been found in Google's trough, which shows that UGC was helping DU in implementing this course till last year
 dinaank paanch june or saal 2013 ko da hindu akhbaar main samvaadadaata aarti dhar ne likhaa he ki ujisi ne diu main lagu ho rahe epaviupi course ke lagu hone kii pragati par najar rakhane or salaah dene ke liye paanch sadasyon kii ek salaahkaar samiti banaai he, jiske adhyaksh vaigyanik tathaa audyogic anusandhan parishad (siesaiaar) ke purv mahanideshak esake joshi ko banaaya gaya he
 The committee has people like Mrinal Miri, director of the Tata Institute of Social Science, and s Parasuraman, former director of the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies
 tab ujisi adhyaksh professor veda prakaash ne notification jari kiya tha ki ujisi kii yah cameti diu ke is kadam ko lagu karne main madad karegi or salaah degi
 In the same letter written to DU on 16 June, the Director of the UGC says that on 25 February 2014 this advisory committee gave the report
 iske anusaar diu ne rashtriya shiksha niti kaa anupaalan nahin kiya he
 The report arrives on 25 February and the autonomous body called UGC takes an independent decision on 20 June, without any intervention from the Ministry of Human Resources
 saadhe teen maheene tak ujisi ne is report par twarit karrwai kyon nahin kii? par yah samiti to course ke lagu karne main madad ke liye bhi bani thi
 So will the public also know what the SK Joshi Committee helped to implement FYUP
 epaviupi ke lagu karne kii prakriya ko lekar vivaad rahaa he, magar use hataane kaa tarika kya niyamanukul he
 What can allegedly be resorted to is another wrong to remove a wrong
 kya vaaki diu kii swaittata vaali daleel pukhta he
 Does UGC have the authority to do so? In a transparent India with 21st century social media, the heads of these institutions should come before the press and present their views
 ujisi yaa esake joshi cameti ko yah saaf karnaa chahie ki nahin ki epaviupi 10 plus tu plus thri ke khilaaf tha to pataa chalane main june 2013 se lekar 25 farvari kaa itnaa vakt kyon laga? kya tab ujisi sarkaar ke dabaav main thi yaa ab he

 The President should intervene in this matter

 Thinking this, Acharya made another set of portraits

 It is worth mentioning that last year, cricketer Virat Kohli signed an agreement of Rs 10 crore annually with the German company Adidas, so the amount of the contract of Tiger Woods is considered to be huge in terms of sports world
 kam se kam pichley dedh dashak se golf kii sabase badi pahchaan bane tiger woods kaa bharat ke saath ab ek nayaa rishta jud gaya he, or vah bhartiya motcycle company hero motocorp ke saath chaar saal tak brands ambaseder banakar rahenge
 Tiger Woods, who had signed this huge deal for the world of sports, visited India this year and his memories are still fresh in his mind
 dilachasp baat yah he ki diggaj america golf ko hero motocorp kaa brands ambaseder banaae jane kii ghoshnaa pratishthit pijie vishwa chalange shuru hone se do din pehle kii gai he, or ullekhneey he ki is toornament kii mejabani tiger woods foundation or hero motocorp limited hi kar rahe hai
 Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero motocorp India, told reporters, "we have moved on from the Hero World Challenge and we will now have Tiger Woods as the corporate partner for the next four years from December 1
 
 
 " So, now Hero motocorp has become the first Indian company to make famous golfer Tiger Woods a brand ambassador
 vaise, tiger woods isi saal farvari main bhi ek charity pradarshnee match ke liye dilli aae the, jiskaa aayojan hero company ne kiya tha
 At that time, there was an influx of fans to see him at Delhi Golf Club, making his tour of India very memorable for him
 woods bataate hai ki vah dilli main pehali baar khel rahe the
 There he was told about the history of Delhi Golf Club, which he liked very much
 vah apane saathi khilaadi hero motocorp group ke chairman or managing diarector pawan munjaal kii lokapriyata se bhi kaaphi prabhavit hue the, lekin pawan munjaal kehete hai ki darasal sab log woods ko dekhne ke liye rassi ke duusari ore aana chaahate the, isliye unase zyada pahchaan badha rahe the
 In this way, Tiger Woods is returning for the fifth time and that too with great style
 hero world chalange golf toornament ke liye vah puri tarah game feet to nahin hai, lekin hameshaa kii tarah ummiido se bhare hai
 Woods says that he is hitting a lot of balls and practicing heavily
 vah maanate hai ki vah utane game feet nahin hai, jitna unhen hona chahie
 Probably also because he has not played any tournament since August
 vah kehete hai ki chaar maheene kaa yah vakt ek lanbaa vakt he
 By the way, Indian fans can be very happy that Woods seems impressed with the talent of Indian golfers
 vah kehete hai ki bhartiya golf khilaadiyon main acchhee pratibha he
 He believes that if the base is big then many good players will emerge
 bharat main bachche is khel ko lekar utsahit hai, yah baat unhen bahut acchhee lagi
 While golf is considered an elite sport in India, Woods' identity is one of the most unique in the world, including India, and he is appreciated in all classes
 yahi vajah he ki woods kaa bhartiya conection phans ko behad utsahit kar rahaa he

 apni aamadani badhaane ke liye bhartiya railway ne maal haada or yatri kiraye ke alaava duusare strot talashne shuru kar die hai

 For the sixth consecutive year, the repo rate is expected to be cut 2 in the repo rate in 6 years
 85 fisadi tak kii ho chuki he katauteearabiai governor shaktikant das kii adhyakshata main maudrik niti kii samiksha baithak ke nattejey guuruuvaar ko aane vaale hai
 There is a possibility that the central bank may cut the repo rate one more time to speed up the slowing economy
 rigerv bank agar aisa karata he to is saal lagaataar chhathi baar repo rate main katautee hogi
 However, despite continuous cuts from the RBI, the customers are not getting the benefit from the banks as expected
 agar sahi dhang se bank ise lagu karen to home or auto lone samet anya tarah ke karj kaaphi saste ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, the question is why banks are not giving the benefit of repo rate cut to the customers
 aaie samajhate hai puure maamle ko
 
 
 First of all, know what is repo rate? Repo rate is the rate at which RBI gives loans to banks
 bank isi aadhaar par graahakon ko karj muhaiyaa karaate hai
 The banks get relief from the low repo rate
 repo rate katautee hone ke baad bainkon par byaaj dar kam karne kaa dabaav banataa he
 The RBI reviews the repo rate at a monetary policy meeting held every two months
 arabiai kii samiksha kaa aadhaar mukhya taur par mahangaai ke aankade or arthvyavastha kii haalat hoti he
 If the condition of the economy does not improve, the possibility of a cut in the repo rate increases
 modiraj main 2
 85% Reduced Repo Rate In the last 6 years, when talking about the repo rate, RBI has 2
 85 fisadi tak kii katautee kii he
 In January 2014, the repo rate stood at 8 per cent
 iske baad se repo rate main katautee kaa silsilaa samay-samay par jari rahaa or yah oktober 2019 main 5
 Reached 15 percent
 vahiin rigerv bank sirf is saal abtak paanch baar kul 1
 Has cut 35
 jabaki is dauraan desh ke sabase bade sarkari bank esbiai ne byaaj dar main 2 fisadi kii katautee kii he
 SBI interest rate in January 2014 where 10
 15 fisadi thi, jo ab ghatakar 8
 Has come down to 15 percent
 sarkaar or arabiai kii apil bhi beasar!ahm baat ye he ki arabiai or sarkaar ke baar-baar kehane ke baad bhi bainkon ne ummid ke mutabik graahakon ko phayda nahin pahunchaaya he
 From October 1, the RBI made it mandatory for banks to link all new floating rates to the repo rate
 iske jariye graahakon ko repo rate katautee kaa sidhaa phayda milane kii ummid thi
 But banks increased their margins
 kya hamargin kaa ganit?masalan, esbiai ne nae home lone par ab apana margin badha diya he, jiskaa sidhaa asar aapke lone par ho rahaa he or aapako zyada byaaj bharna padegaa
 SBI first applied its margin2
 25 fisadi se badhaakar 2
 65 percent
 yahaan bataa den ki kisi bhi bank dwaara lone par jo byaaj dar lagaai jaati he usamen margin bhi shaamil hota he
 Every bank can increase or decrease it accordingly
 yahi vajah he ki repo rate 5
 Despite being 15 per cent, the rate of interest is more than 8 per cent and the customers do not get the expected benefits

 In Hindi films about the court, the dialogue is often heard "date on date"
 lekin ab surat-e-haal badalata hua najar aa rahaa he
 Especially those courts which have been constituted to hear the cases of mps and mlas on the orders of the Supreme Court
 dilli main patiala house court main aisi 2 special court he
 Most of the cases here are related to the mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party and in 19 of the 22 cases, the court has given its verdict in less than 6 months
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf maamalon main patiala house court kii vishesh rup se gathit special court 1 march se maamalon kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 In some cases of defamation, Chief Minister Kejriwal has settled out of court and concluded the case, while in some cases his mlas have been acquitted by the court and in some cases the mlas have also been convicted
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ke khilaaf chal rahe 22 maamalon main se 19 maamalon main court apana faisla suna chuki he
 Some of these cases are violations of the code of conduct during elections, some related to assault and some related to corruption
 kanoonee visheshgy maanate he ki court kaa faisla jaldi aata he to janata ko bhi yah pataa chalata he ki unke netaaon par lage aarope sahi he yaa galat
 Between March 1 and July 31, the Special Court heard about 144 cases involving leaders
 jisamen se kuch maamalon main police ke chargeshit der se file karne par cese khatm kar diya gaya
 In some, the police could not gather evidence
 or kuch maamalon main gavaah court main pesh hue hi nahin
 Aam Aadmi Party leaders include ministers like Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Kailash Gehlot and Asim Ahmed Khan, who have been acquitted by the court
 haalanki devendra saharaavat or sahiram pahalwaan jaise aap ke vidhayakon ko court ne doshi bhi qaraar diya he
 According to the new law, if these people are sentenced to more than 2 years, then they cannot contest elections further and their legislature will also go
 kanoonee visheshgy maanate hai ki 1 saal kii samay seemaa main cese khatm karne ko lekar kai adchane bhi hai
 Law expert Anil Soni says that now the Supreme Court has ordered to give its verdict after completing the hearing within 1 year
 to netaaon kii hadabdaahat bad gai he or vah kisi bhi tarah bari hone ke liye gavaahon ke saath out of da court jaakar setlement kar rahe hai
 Because if he is convicted in court, then he will not be able to contest further elections
 bhrashtachar se jude maamalon main idi or sibiai jaisi jaanch agenciyon ko mani trail ko sabit karne main kaaphi vakt lagata he
 But the lawyer associated with the agency says that due to the time limit of 1 year, the investigation will be completed in a hurry, due to which the case can also be weakened while investigating the case and proving the important aspect in court
 jiskaa phayda aaropee le sakate hai
 But it is certain that after the formation of the Special Court, the hearing of cases related to leaders has increased
 or ab is tarah ke maamalon main agali taarikh ke liye chah chah maheene kaa intjaar nahin karnaa padataa

 Due to Sushma Swaraj's image, there is no shortage of those who like her on Twitter, so many people praised her for this 'great' answer, but there were some people who disagreed with Sushma Swaraj this time
 It seemed important, because they believe that not all politicians can be sympathetic to the Indian foreign minister such as hardworking, noble and public

 ) Gujarat is again in discussion these days
 is baar charchaa kii vajah he pradesh ke kalakaaron kaa ratnakar puraskaar lautaanaa
 Now the question is also arising that why are the artists of the state returning the award? Behind the cast's displeasure is the commentary made by the saint of the Swaminarayan sect during the ruckus that began on the statement of the hometown saint Morari Bapu, the Ram Katha
 vivaad kii shuruyaat morari baapu ke us bayaan se hui thi, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki shiv hi nilkanth hai
 There is no such neelkanth
 morari baapu ke bayaan par swaminarayan sampradaay ne aapatti jataai thi
 Swaminarayan sect considers Lord Neelkanth Varni
 kalakaar morari baapu ke samarthan main aa gaye
 Due to this, Vivek Swami of the Swaminarayan sect made controversial remarks about the artists
 swami ne kaha ki kalakaar manch par sharaab kaa seven kar sho karte hai
 The artist Swami is said to be hurt by this comment
 is bayaan se naaraaz kalakaaron ne swaminarayan sampradaay dwaara die gaye ratnakar puraskaar lautaane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Sairam Dave, Jignesh Kaviraj and Osman Mir have announced the return of their Ratnakar Awards
 sairam dave ne kaha ki morari baapu kii ek tippanee ko lekar jo vivaad paidaa hua, usase kala jagat aahat he
 One saint said that the artists coming after drinking the liquor are also talking
 unhone kaha ki yah manch hamaare liye bahut sammanjanak he, saraswati kii god he or ham manch kii mahima ko banaae rakhane kii lagaataar koshish karte rahe hai
 Dave said that i had received the Ratnakar Award from the Swaminarayan sect
 unhone puraskaar lautaane kii ghoshnaa kii
 Jignesh Kaviraj said that a few days ago, Vivek Swamy had insulted the artist in one of his videos, making it disturbing
 phir duusare video main unhone maafee maangi
 The artist was awarded the Ratnakar Award
 unhone kaha ki sammaan or apmaan ek saath nahin ho saktaa he
 Kaviraj said that i am saddened by Vivek Swami's indiscretion
 osman mir ne kaha ki kalakaaron ke liye jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya gaya, vah bahut dukhad he
 Morari Bapu speaks of all religions evenly and the same is true for us
 ek kalakaar ke rup main mujhe is baat kaa gaharaa dukh he
 He said that the saints of the Swaminarayan sect, whom we consider to be revered, have used such words for artists and Bapu, so the Ratnakar Award that i received as an artist from Gujarat, i return with folded hands and prudently
 gauratlab he ki mayabhai aahir, bihari hemu gadhwi, anubha gadhwi or lokagayak hemanth chouhan bhi ratnakar puraskaar waapas lautaa chuke hai

 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle ranneetikakar or janata dal united ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) kaa ek bayaan siyaasi bhuuchaal laa saktaa he
 JD (U) national vice-president Prashant Kishore has said that he does not agree with his party president Nitish Kumar's way of re-aligning with the BJP and that the Bihar chief minister should be sworn in to join the saffron party-led NDA after it leaves the Grand Alliance
 Should have got a fresh mandate form
 chunavi ranneetikaar se netaa bane kishor ne ek saakshaatkaar main yah baat kahi
 It is clear from this statement that Prashant Kishore is not happy with Nitish Kumar's decision to break with the Grand Alliance and join BJP
 prashanth kishor ke bayaan se unki apni hi party main naaraazgi he kyonki yah saakshaatkaar shuukravaar ko soshal media par viral ho gaya
 However, in the interview, Kishore underscored that changing leaders' noses is not a new thing
 unhone kaha, ‘aap chandrababu naidu, naveen patnayak or dramuk jaisi partiyon ko dekhen
 In retrospect, we also have the example of VP Singh government
 ise bhaajapa or vam dalon donon ne samarthan diya tha
 Prashant Kishore said that there is no scale to measure whether Nitish's decision to separate from the Grand Alliance in July 2017 was correct
 mahagathbandhan main rajd or congress bhi shaamil thi
 He said, 'those who saw in him the possibility of challenging (nitish) Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were disappointed with this move
 lekin jin logon kii yah raay thi ki unhone modi se muqabla karne ke utsaah main shashan se samjhauta karnaa shuru kar diya, wo sahi mahasoos karenge
 When asked to comment on that episode, Prashant Kishore said, "keeping in mind the interests of Bihar, i believe it was right
" lekin jo tarika apanaaya gaya usase main sahamat nahin hum
 i have said this before and i am still of the opinion that he should ideally have got a new mandate when he decided to return to the bjp-led coalition
 ' bataa den ki prashanth kishor ne 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan chunavi ranneetikaar ke taur par kaam kiya tha
 In that election, Nitish was the chief ministerial candidate from the Grand Alliance
 rajd pramukh lalu prasad ke chote bete or rajya ke tatkaaleen up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon ne nitish ko asahaj kiya or unhone aakhirkaar mukhyamantri pad se istipha diya
 But he took the oath of chief minister again within 24 hours after the BJP supported the dramatic event
 prashanth kishor ke bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue rajd vidhayak or party kii bihar ikai ke mukhya pravaktaa bhai virendra ne kaha, ‘jad (you) ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh kaa bayaan hamaare aaropon ko sweekaar karne ke samaan he
 Nitish got the mandate as a candidate for the Grand Alliance, which also included the RJD and the Congress
 unka naye sire se janadesh maange bina rajg main chale jane kaa kadam mahagathbandhan kii peeth main chura ghonpane ke samaan he
 JD (U) councilor and party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar tried to remind Kishore that he had just arrived in politics
 kishor ko pichley saal sitambar main party main shaamil kiya gaya tha or kuch saptaah ke baad unhen party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 Neeraj Kumar said, 'I don't want to comment on what he (kishore) said, but i would like to show him a mirror

 Film Name: Ghayal Once Again Director: Sunny Deolstar Cast: Sunny Deol, Soha Ali Khan, Om Puri, Murali Sharma, Tisca Chopra, Narendra Jha, Shivam Patil, Diana Khan, Anchal Munjal Duration: 2 hours 08 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 2 Starsaal released a blockbuster film 'ghayal' in 1990 and now almost 25 years later its next installment has been made, sometimes called 'ghayal Part 2', sometimes 'ghayal Returns' and finally Makers called it 'ghayal Once a' En'kha
 film ko khud sani deol ne likhaa, abhinay kiya or diarect bhi kiya he
 Now, would viewers like to see this film with the same passion as Krej had with the previously released film 'ghayal'? Let us finally know how Sunny Deol's film 'gayle Once Again' is
 kahaniyaha kahani ek dabang bijnesaman raaj bansal (narendra jha) or 'satyakam' media ke sanchaalak ajay mehara (sani deol) ke bich bade vivaad kii he
 Raj Bansal wants to suppress the voice of the youth and Ajay Mehra tries to bring out the truth of these young children at all costs
 film main asipi jo di suja (om puri) or reeha (soha ali khan) kii bhi maujuudagi he jo kahani main ahm role play karte hai saath hi yuva bacchon ke rup main rishabh aroda (varun), sivam patil (rohan), anoushka (anchal munjaal) or joya (dyna khan) hai
 Now will Ajay Mehra be able to put an end to evils with the power of truth? You will have to watch the film to know it
 scriptfilm kii kahani bahut hi saadhaaran he
 It is a war between good and evil that has been shown on the film screen for the last nearly 6 decades
 kahani is sadi main besd he jisamen flashbek main film 'ghayal' ke kuch pal bhi dikhaae gaye hai
 There is action and dialogue but there is no dialogue that affects you very much
 yuvaaon ko gyaan dene kii bharpoor koshish kii gai he or ection kaa overdoj he, train, car, bike se lekar hawaii jahaaj ke jariye bharpoor ection shaamil he, script kaabhi khinchi hui he
 The film seems far beyond reality
 abhinayafilm main om puri, soha ali khan, tiska chopra samet chaaron yuva actors ne apane kirdaar ko bakhubi adaa kiya he
 Sunny Deol is also seen right in his character but not much connecting in this role
 film main negative kirdaar main narendra jha ne acha kaam kiya he, narendra isse pehle film 'haidar' main najar aae the
 The directors have also done well for the strong action in the film
 sangitafilm kaa sangeet thik thaak he or kahani ke saath jarur jaataa he
 Especially background music is good
 kamjor kadisbase kamjor kadi film kii script he jo 21veen sadi main gyandaayak dikhaai detii he
 It could have been written even more tremendously according to the youth
 itane achche tabadatod ection ke bich kahani feeki pad gai
 However, the audience of single theater will surely enjoy watching the action factor of the film
 kyon dekhensoni deolke diwane hai to yah film jarur dekhen, nahin to paise bachaaen
 People playing Holi can now avoid skin diseases, as researchers at Jadavpur University have designed a white herbal 'gulal' that will be completely safe for the skin as well as protect it from diseases
 ab anusandhankarta is gulaal kaa patent karaane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 University vice-chancellor Siddharth Dutta said that unlike other colored gulls sold in the market, this white gulal resembles talcum powder
 isamen aise tatv nahin milaae gaye hai jo twachaa ke liye nuksaandaayak hon
 He said that such elements have been added to white gulal, which are considered beneficial in many skin diseases
 yah gulaal phulon or neem ke arq tathaa anya herbal utpaadon se taiyaar kiya gaya he or isamen rajnigandha kii khushboo milaai gai he
 This is the result of a year's hard work of a ten-member team of Gulal researchers
 datta ne kaha, ‘hamaare praayogic pareekshan safal rahe
 We are now considering applying for patenting our technology
 ’bazaar main beche ja rahe rangon main jasta or paare jaisi baari dhaatuen milaai jaati hai jinase twachaa main jalan hoti he tathaa chhaale pad sakate hai
 These colors can also cause problems in the kidneys, lungs and liver when going in with the breath
 safed gulaal un abhibhavakon ke liye bhi upyukt he jo swasthya sambandhi samasyaon ke dar se apane bacchon ko pani or sookhe rangon se holi khilne kii anumati nahin dete
 Prof Dutta, who led the research said, 'children's skin is very soft and sensitive, so they are prone to problems due to the hazardous elements present in the colors
 lekin safed gulaal se chah maah se adhik umr ke bacchon kii twachaa ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 'as an experiment, the university has so far sold 50 to 60 kg of white herbal gulal
 ek dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki sthaneey nivasee or vidhyaarthee holi ke bahut pehle se hi yah gulaal khel rahe hai, kyonki iske aushadhiy gunon kii vajah se vishvavidhyalay ke adhikariyon ne aisa suzav diya tha
 In all these cases, the taxpayer will not know who the officer is assessing his case, nor will that officer have any information about which person or institution's chamber is assessing

 The shadows of books were playing on their ascended faces
 aas-paas sipaahi talavaarein thame or neje uthaaye khadey the
 People stood in front to see which criminal gets what punishment
 sabaki gardanen jhuki hui thim
 He was looking helplessly in his eyes
 or saans rukii hui thi, maano amir kii aankhon main ek aisi takat thi, jo unke dilon par dar or rob gaalib kar rahi thi
 Amir raised his hand and shouted, "attend the accused one by one in front of me and tell me which of them has done the wrong?" The prison door was opened and black walls started appearing
 zanjiro kii jhankaar sunai dene lagi
 He was accompanied by the sighs and wailing of the prisoners
 log gardanen uthaa-uthaakar unki taraf dekhne lage, maanon us kabr kii gaharaaiyon se nikaali hui us maut kii shikaron par pehle najar daalane main ek-duusare ke aage bad janaa chaahate hon
 a little later, two soldiers came out of the prison, with a young man in their possession
 is noujvaan ke haathon main hathkadi thi or uski chadhi hui tyori tathaa nidar chehre se uske swabhimaan or atmik bal kaa pataa chalata tha
 The soldiers put him in the middle of the court and stood a little behind themselves
 amir ne ek kshan unki taraf ghurkar dekha, phir sawaal kiya, ‘‘is aadmi ne, jo hamaare saamne is tarah sir uthaaye khadaa he, jaise adaalat kii jakad main na ho, balki kisi oonchi jagah par khadaa ho, kya jurm kiya he ?’’amir ke wajiron main se ek ne jawaab diya, ‘‘kal ek faujee afasar or chand sipaahi dehaat main kaam par gayi the
 This man killed the officer

 Amir began to tremble with anger
 uski ankhon se aag kii chinagaariyaan barasane lageen
 He said in a roaring voice, "hold it in chains and then lock it in the same dark cell
" kal subah isi kii talwaar se isaki gardan uda do or isaki laash ko shahar ke baahar phenk do, jisase giddh or chilein iskaa gosht nonch len or hawa isaki badboo ko iske gharavaalon or iske doston tak pahunchaa de
 The young man was taken back to prison
 logon kii dukhabhari nigahen uske peeche-peeche gayi, kyonki vah abhi kam umr kaa tha khubasurat tha or hatta-katta tha
 The soldiers then came out of the prison with a woman
 vah stri bahut sundar or komalangi thi
 The paleness of sorrow and despair was visible in his eyes
 uski ankhen nichi ho rahi thim or lajja ke maare uski gardan jhuki thi
 The Amir looked at him and said, "this woman who stands before us, like a shadow in front of the truth, what fault have you committed?" a wazir replied, "this woman is a slut
" raat ko jab iskaa khavind ghar aayaa tab usne dekha ki yah apane yaar ke saath soi hui he
 His friend ran away in fear and Khavind handed it over to the police
 ’’yah sunakar amir bahut bigadaa
 The woman became watery in shame
 amir ne oonchi aawaaj main kaha, ‘‘ise waapas kaidakhane main le jaao or kaanton ke bistar par sulaao, taaki yah us bistar ko yaad kare, jise isane apane paap se napak banaaya or ise inaar mila hua sirka pilaao, taaki yah apane ghar ke khaane ko yaad kare
 In the morning, take it out naked and drag it out of the city and gather
 isaki laash ko vahiin pade rahane do, taaki bhediya iskaa gosht kha jaaen or isaki haddiyon ko keede-makode chaat len
 The woman was then taken to the dark cell of the prison
 log uski taraf afsos kii najaron se dekh rahe the
 He was happy at Amir's justice, but he was also astonished at the beauty, tenderness and sad eyes of the woman
 iske baad do sipaahi adhed umr ke ek kamjor aadmi ko liye hue aaye, jo apane kaanpate hue ghutanon ko ghaseetata hua chalata tha
 He looked at the crowd with distraught eyes
 uski ankhon main masumi, barbaadi or garibi jhalak rahi thi
 Amir looked at him and excitedly asked, "this dirty man, who stands like a dead man in the dead, what is the fault?" Wazir replied, "this is a thief
" raat ke vakt yah kalisa main ja ghusaa or jogiyon ne ise pakad liya
 Pots of worship were found in his bag
 ’’amir ne uski taraf dekha, jaisaa bhookha giddh par kati chidiya kii ore dekhtaa he
 Shouted, "throw it again in the dark of the prison and hold it in chains
" jab subah ho jaay tab ise reshmi rassi se ek oonche ped par lataka do or isi tarah ise tab tak jameen or aasmaan ke bich lataka rahane do jab tak isaki gunahagaar anguliyaan sad-lag na jaayan or inaki badboo chaaron taraf fail na jaay
 "the soldiers again took the thief into prison and the people began to whisper how this darling Kafir dared to steal the pots of worship? The emir descended from the throne and his scholars and wise advisors followed him, the soldiers some more and some more behind
 logon kii bheed teetar-bitar ho gai or vah sthaan khaali ho gaya, alabatta kaidiyon kii aahen or gahari saanse sunai detii raheen
 i was surprised at this law standing there, which humans have made for humans
 main us cheez par gaur kar rahaa tha, jise log insaaf kehete hai
 While thinking, my thoughts disappeared like this, the way the redness of the evening hides in the mist
 main us makaan se niklaa
 He used to say in his heart that the grass grows from the soil, the goat eats the grass, the wolf feeds the goat, the rhinoceros devours the wolf and the lion kills the rhinoceros
 kya koi aisi takat maujuud he, in tamaam ghinauni baton ko achche nattejey main badal de ? kya koi aisi takat he, jo jindagi kii sari takaton ko apane haath main le le or apane andar jajb kar le- jis tarah samudr sari nadiyon ko apni gaharaai main samaa letaa he ? kya koi aisi takat he, jo kaatil ko or makatool ko, bura kaam karne vaali or uske saath bura kaam karne vaale chor or jiske yahaan chori kii gai usko tathaa amir ke asana se zyada oonche nyaay ke asana ke saamne khadaa kar de ?duusare din main shahar se nikalakar kheton kii taraf gaya, taaki man ko kuch chaiyn mili or jangal kaa manohar vayumandal dukh or maayusi ke un jantuon ko maar de, jo shahar ke tang gali-koochon or andhere makaanon main mere andar paidaa kar die the
 When i reached the valley, i saw that flocks of vultures, eagles and crows are flying and landing on the ground
 unki awaajon or pairon kii fadafadaahat se vaataavaran kaanp rahaa he
 When i went ahead, i saw a dead body hanging in front of me and the lifeless body of a naked woman lying in the heap of stones from which she was collected
 udhar ek noujvaan kii laash dhul tathaa khun se sani hui he, or uskaa sir dhad se juda padaa he
 i stayed there
 meri ankhon par ek motaa or andhera pardaa pad gaya or mujhe kalpana or maut ke sivaay, jo khun main sani un laashon par chai hui thi, kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he
 My ears heard nothing but the call of ruin
 is pukaar main kauwon kii aawaaj bhi mili hui thi, jo inasaani kanoon ke shikaron ke chaaron taraf mandara rahe the
 Three humans were alive till yesterday, this morning went to death
 teen aadamiyon ne insaan ke astitv main apni nishtha ko kho diya or andhe kanoon ne haath badhaakar unhen bedardi ke saath paamaal kar diya
 The three men were held guilty by the prison because they were weak and the law put them to death, because it was powerful
 ek aadmi ne duusare ko katl kar diya tha to vah kaatil (khooni) tehra; lekin jab amir ne use katl karvaa diya to amir insaaf karne vaala samajha gaya
 When a man took the items of worship, people called him a thief, but when Amir took away his life, he became a rich scholar
 ek aurat ne apane pati se beyimaani kii to logon ne use kulata tehraaya, lekin jab amir ne use nanga karke sangsar karavaaya to amir sharif kahalaaya
 To bleed is unsafe, but who made it halter for the rich? It is a crime to grab goods, but who justified the grabbing of souls? The dishonesty of women is a bad thing, but who said that to collect beautiful bodies is a culinary act
 Is it? We do a lot of bullying in the face of petty bullying and say that this is the law
 ham fasaad kaa badla badtareen fasaad se dete hai or kehete hai ki yah sheel he
 We commit another crime to avenge one crime and shout that this is justice! Did Amir never kill his enemy? Has he never usurped the goods of a weak person of his people? Has he never raised his eyes to a beautiful woman? Is he justified by all these crimes, that he is justified in blowing the murderer's neck, crucifying the thief, and organizing the adulteress? Who were those who hanged the thief? Did the angels descend from the sky, or were they the same people who grab the goods that come in their hands? And who had the head of that murderer? Did the Prophet and Prophet come from above, or were they the soldiers who keep on killing and blooding? And who communicated that adulteress? Did Pakistan spirits come from their places for that work? Or were they the same people who do evil things in the veil of darkness? Law! 
 
 kanoon kya cheez he ? use aasmaan kii unchaaiyon se suraj kii kirnon ke saath utarate kisne dekha he ? or kis aadmi ne khudaai ichha ko insaan ke dil se mila-jula paaya he ? or kis khandaan main farishton ne aakar inasaanon se kaha he ki kamajoro ko jindagi kii roshni se maharoom kar do, gire hue ko talwaar se uda do or kasoor karne vaale ko fauladi paanvon ke neeche rond daalo ?mere dimag main yahi vichaar chakkar laga rahe the or mujhe pareshaan kar rahe the ki itane main maine kisi ke pairon kii aahat suni
 When i lifted my eyes, i saw a woman coming out of the trees and coming close to the corpses
 uske chehre par khatre ke nishaan dikhaai de rahe the, maano vah us bhayaavah najaare ko dekhakar dar gai ho
 She moved towards the corpse, whose head was chopped off and wept screaming
 apni kaanpati hui baahon se usne laash ko gale lagaaya
 His eyes were filled with tears
 vah apni ungliyaan laash ke baalo main pher rahi thi
 When she got tired she started digging the ground with her hands, even digging a long wide grave
 phir usne us noujvaan kii laash ko uthaakar kabr main rakh diya
 His severed and blood-soaked head lay on his shoulders and covered the tomb with mud and buryed the fruit of the sword above it, from which his head was beheaded
 iske baad usne aansu bahaate hue mujhase kaha, ‘‘amir se kah do bajaay iske ki main us insaan kii laash ko, jisane mujhe beijjati ke kabje se chhudaaya, jangal ke khoonkhwaar jaanwaron or parindon ke khaane ke liye chhod duun, mere liye behatar he ki main mar jaau or us aadmi se ja miluun
 "I said to him," o unhappy woman, do not be afraid of me, because i have mourned these mayyats before you, but tell me how did this man save you from the possession of dishonor? " a voice replied, "an Amir officer came to collect the rent and jizya in our fields; But when he saw me, his intention was changed
 iske baad usne mere baap kii taraf baari rakam nikaal di or chunki mere garib baap yah rakam adaa nahin kar sakate the, us afasar ne gusse main aakar rupaye ke badale main mujh par kabja kar liya, is khyal se ki mujhe amir ke mahal main pahunchaa de
 i cried and begged him for mercy, but he did not feel sorry
 maine usase baap ke budhaape kii taraf dhyaan dene kii kii minnat kii, lekin vah na pasija
 Then i shouted and gathered the villagers and pleaded before him
 is par vah noujvaan, jiske saath meri mangani ho chuki thi, aayaa or usne mujhe afasar ke haathon se chhudaaya
 The officer angrily tried to kill him, but the young man defiantly saved himself and by slapping an old sword hanging from the wall, he slaughtered the officer in response to his attack on me and to protect my body
 iske baad vah apni izzat ke liye makatool kii laash ke paas hi khadaa rahaa
 Eventually the soldiers arrested him and put him in prison
 ’’yah kehete-kehete usne meri taraf dil ko pighalane vaali nigaah se dekha, phir jaldi se peeth modakar chal di
 His painful voice echoed in the air
 thodi der ke baad maine ek noujvaan ko aate dekha, jisane apana cheharaa kapade se dhank rakhaa tha
 He stopped approaching the adulteress's corpse
 usne apana kurta utarkar us nangi aurat ko dhank diya or apane khanjar se jameen khodne laga
 When the tomb was ready, he buried the woman in it
 jab yah kaam puraa ho gaya to usne idhar-udhar se kuch phool todakar unka ek guladasta banaaya or us kabr par rakh diya
 When he started leaving, i stopped him and said, "what was your relationship with this woman that you worked so hard for this against the will of the rich and risking your life and it made the body to become a dose of crows and eagles?" Saved from? ”the young man looked at me, it was clear from his eyes that he has cried and washed and he has spent the whole night awake
 vah bahut duhkhi or maayusi bhari aawaaj main bolaa, ‘‘main vahi badanaseeb aadmi hoon jisaki vajah se is bechaari ko sangsar kiya gaya
 We have wanted each other since we played together during childhood
 ham jawan ho gayi hamaari muhabbat bhi puri tarah ubhar ai
 Once when i had gone to the city, the girl's father forced her to marry another man
 main waapas aayaa or maine yah khabar suni to meri jindagi main andhera chaa gaya or mujhe jeena dubhar ho gaya
 i quarreled a lot with my inner desire, but was defeated
 meri muhabbat mujhe is tarah lekar chal di jis tarah ankhon vaala kisi andhe ko rasta dikhaata he
 i went to his house in secret, so that i could see his eyes and hear the song of his voice
 maine use akeli paaya
 She was crying her luck and regretting her life
 main uske paas baith gaya
 We were engrossed in talking and God knows that our hearts were clean
 lekin jab ek ghanta guzar gaya to ekaek uskaa khavind aa gaya
 When he saw me, he went mad with anger
 usne apni aurat ke gale main kapadaa daalkar shor machaana shuru kar diya, logo ! aao ! or is aurat or uske yaar ko dekho ! adosi-padosi jamaa ho gayi or thodi der main pulisavaale bhi khabar paakar aa pahunche
 The man gave his woman in the tight hands of the police, who dragged her to the police station
 lekin kisi ne mujh par haath bhi na uthaaya, kyonki andhaa kanoon or gandi roodhiya aurat kaa hi peechha karti hai, mard kaa to har kasoor maaf samajha jaataa he
 "after telling this story, the young man hid his face and walked towards the city and left me looking at the corpse, which was hanging from the tree and shaking with the branches of the tree with the blows of the air, as if it were from the spirits
 Asking for mercy, and wants to be taken down and put on the ground in the aspect of the lovers of humanity and the martyrs of love
 ek ghante ke baad ek dubli-patali aurat aa pahunchi, jiske kapade chithde ho rahe the
 She came close to the dead body hanging from the tree and lightened her heart by crying
 iske baad vah ped par chadh gai or usne apane daanton se reshmi rassi ko kholaa
 The corpse hit the ground like a wet cloth
 aurat ped ke neeche utari or do kabron ke pahalu main teesri kabr khodi or usamen laash ko dafan kar diya
 When she had put soil on the tomb, she took two pieces of wood and made her cross and buried it at the head of the tomb
 jab vah jane lagi to maine badhkar sawaal kiya, ‘‘o aurat, tumhen kis baat ne majaboor kiya ki tum ek chor ko dafan karne ke liye yahan aao ?’’usne meri taraf dekha
 Traces of discomfort and discomfort were visible from his eyes
 usne kaha, ‘‘hamaare paanch bachche bhukhon mar rahe hai
 The eldest of them is eight years old and the youngest still drinks milk
 meraa khavind chor na tha
 He used to do farming in the church land and the jogis of the church used to pay him so much money that if we ate food in the evening, we would have nothing left in the morning
 jab meraa khavind jawan tha to vah girjaghar ke kheton ko apane paseene se sinchataa tha or apni bahon kii takat se vahaan ke baagon ko haraa-bharaa rakhata tha, lekin jab vah boodha ho gaya or jab saalon kii mehnat ne uski takat ko khatm kar diya or bimariyon ne use gher liya to unhone use yah kahkar naukari se hataa diya ki girizaa ko ab tumhaari jarurat nahin he, ab tum chale jaao
 When your sons become young, send them here so that they can take your place
 meraa khavind unke saamne bahut royaa-dhoyaa
 He begged mercy from them in the name of Jesus Christ and administered them to the angels and companions of Christ; But they did not take pity and show favor to him - neither to me nor to our children
 ‘‘meraa khavind shahar main gaya taaki koi naukari dhunde, lekin naakaamayaab hokar lautaa, kyonki un mehalon main rahane vaale sirf jawan aadamiyon ko naukar rakhte the
 After this he sat on the road, so that people would get donations or alms

 Researchers have found that through third party tracking scripts, these websites inject a login form that does not appear in the background of the webpage
 isse broujar aadhaarit inbilt password manager yujar kii sevd jaankariyaan jaise yujaranem or password churaate hai
 How to protect? The simple thing is, if you do not save your username in a web browser, then it will be difficult for any advertising companies to steal it
 itnaa hi nahin broujar main seve kiye gaye password ke or bhi nuksaan he, agar aapane kahin broujar khulaa choda he to koi iskaa galat phayda uthaa saktaa he
 So be cautious and as far as possible avoid saving passwords in any web browser

 ab modi sarkaar chaahe kitne hi morchon par lard le, par mahangaai ke masale par sarkaar kii naakaami jaahir ho chuki he
 This is the reason that the opposition's attacks have also intensified

 Pulses, rice, milk and fruits were not only expensive, but now vegetables have also become very expensive

 In such a situation, anger against the Modi government was bound to increase
 acha mauka dekhakar rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'there is a difference in the words and actions of the Modi government
 'rahul gandhi ne sawaal uthaae ki mahangaai kam karne ke jo vaade kiye gaye the, un vaadon kaa kya hua

 aise main bada sawaal yah he ki kya vipaksh ke hamalon kaa jawaab modi sarkaar 'achche din' laakar de paaegi? There are also many interesting aspects of Osama bin Laden, the world's most wanted notorious terrorist al-qaeda leader
 vah na sirf padhane kaa behad shaukeen he saath hi usamen wollyboul or footbal ko lekar gajab kii deewangi bhi he
 This has been claimed in the book of Nasir al-bahri, once a bodyguard of Laden

 "he is very tall and does not have to bounce to put the ball in the goal post
" ’’ ‘in da shadow of bin laden’ shishark se prakashit is kitaab main kaha gaya he ki laden footbal kaa bhi shaukeen he or vah centre farward pojishan par khelnaa pasand karata he lekin khilne ke dauraan usne apni pagadi kabhi nahin utaari
 Apart from this, Laden is also very interested in horse racing
 nasir ne likhaa he ki alqaida netaa padhane-likhane ke maamle main bhi kaaphi aage he or use dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan sabase preranadai sainya cmanderon main shumaar kiye jane vaale britani field marshall barnard montgomari tathaa france ke purv raashtrapati general charles di gaale ke sansmaran padhanaa acha lagata he
 However, according to the book, Laden's personal life is very bad

 According to the book, Laden tries his best to avoid any quarrel with his four wives
 apni pehali patni par uskaa jaraa bhi jor nahin chalata

 laden kii duusari patni sambhrant gharaane kii saudi mahila he or alqaida netaa usase ‘islamic vigyaan’ se jude muddon par aksar salaah-mashvira karata he
 According to the book, the arrival of Laden's fifth bride from Yemen in 2000, her first four wives reacted sharply
 al baheri ke mutabik laden kii paanchavin bivi ne afghanistan kii pahadiyon main uski sabase vishwasaneey sipaahi ke rup main kareeb chaar saal tak seva kii thi
 Al Bahri believes that Laden is currently hiding in Waziristan in northwest Pakistan, but it does not seem possible to capture him alive
 ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue al baheri ne kaha ki ek baar ‘shaikh’ (laden) ne mujhe ek pistaul saunpane ke saath hidaayat di thi ki agar uske pakade jane kii sthiti bane to uske sir main do goliyaan utaar di jaaen
 al-bahri, who was Laden's bodyguard from 1996 to 2000, was freed after being imprisoned in the US

 One remembers the statement in which the late Rajiv Gandhi had said on the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the violence against the Sikhs that if a big tree falls, the earth shakes
 bhaajapa pravaktaa arapy singh kaa kahana ki 1947 se lekar 2018 tak congress ne desh ko baantne kaa kaam kiya chaahe vah dharm ke naam par ho jati ke naam par ho
 Their politics is only to distribute votes

 Reacting to Rahul, Naqvi said, "A wise enemy is better than an innocent friend, but this saying has been reversed
" ab nadaan dushman ho to uskaa ilaaj to kuch ho nahin saktaa
 The way Rahul Gandhi has been working to discredit India from foreign soil for the last several days, one thing is clear from him that someone has given him a supari to tarnish the image of the country
 'bhartiya arthvyavastha kii tulana china se karne par bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki rahul apni party or apane saamanti parivaar kaa 50 saalon kaa hisaab-kitaab pard len

 The central government, Kejriwal government and all the agencies related to Delhi are reprimanded every year on the poor transport arrangements during the hearing on pollution in NGT court, but if the figures are taken care of, the situation is very pathetic
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik :-1
 The number of cluster and DTC buses in Delhi is around 5500
 yahaan aam aadmi party sarkaar apni satta ke dauraan 700 basen badhaane main hi kaamyaab ho pai he
 2
 in bason main rojaanaa 33 lakh ke aasapaas yatri safar karte hai
 The NGT government has also reprimanded the poor condition of buses

 Talking about only DTC buses, 46 lakh 77 thousand people used to travel everyday in the year 2012-13
 saal 2016 main ditisi bason se har roj safar karne waalon kaa aankada 43 lakh tha, lekin is saal 2017 main yah aankada mahaj 25 lakh rah gaya he
 9
 vahiin, dilli metro main saal 2015 tak roj takreeban 28 lakh log safar karte the
 But after increasing fares first in May and then in October 2017, the number of daily commuters in the metro has been reduced to 25 lakhs
 10
 According to statistics, the number of vehicles registered in Delhi by the year 2016 is more than 1 crore
 dilli main kareeb 20 lakh log public transport ko chhodkar nijee vaahanon kaa istemaal karte hai, jopradooshanke badhane kii sabase badi vajah he
 On November 11, in the NGT court, DPCC officials told the court that two-wheeler and diesel vehicles pollute more than petrol cars
 vaayu pradooshan main do pahiyaa vaahan kul 30% yogadan rahata he, jo sabase zyada hanikaarak gaise failaate hai
 According to the data, the number of 2 wheelers in Delhi has crossed 66 lakhs and the number of 4 wheelers has crossed 30 lakhs
 public transport kaa haal sirf ditisi bason ke level par hi nahin charmara rahaa he, balki metro ko lekar bhi koi thos kadam nahin uthaae gaye hai
