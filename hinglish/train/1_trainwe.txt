 He has also spoken of helping those who are willing for this

 alok verma ko diji tihaad banane ke pehle bahut kam hi log jaanate the
 He had no name in any controversy
 lekin 5 agast 2014 ko jab ve diji tihaad bane to vivaadon ne unka peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 Some IPS sitting at the police headquarters here were writing a script for him
 darasal us daur main tihaad jail main kuch aisa chal rahaa tha jo unhen baar-baar ek diji ke taur par sawaalon ke ghere main khadaa kar rahaa tha
 It was probably an afternoon of 2016 when Sunil Gupta, a law officer in Tihar Jail, held a press conference in a case involving Tihar Jail
 shaayad vah maamla kuch kaidiyon ke asia kii sabase surakshit jail se bhaagane kaa tha
 At that press conference, 1979 batch UT cadre IPS officer Alok Verma, who was then DG Tihar Jail
 bataaya gaya ki pisi vahi karenge
 Verma sat on the hot seat
 camere taiyaar the or verma bolne hi vaale the ki achaanak unhone pisi karne se manaa kar diya
 He entrusted an IG rank officer sitting with him to hold the press conference
 khayr pressvarta hui
 After that when i asked the officials what happened to Verma ji suddenly, he told that they are not camera friendly
 unako maine pehali baar kisi press conference main is tarahadekha tha
 It was Alok Verma's last press conference that ended without him speaking
 uske baad ve 11 maheene tak dilli police kamishnar rahe, lekin kabhi unhen media karmiyon se milte yaa press conference karte nahin dekha gaya
 It was then revealed that they are not media friendly as well as media friendly and even friendly to everyone
 jis samay ve tihaad jail main the, sahaara ke maalik subrato roy bhi jail main the, lekin court ke aadesh par unhen diji aphis ke paas hi rakhaa gaya tha
 At that time, many officers i knew in the Tihar Jail used to discuss the deep friendship of both
 yah bhi kaha jaataa tha ki koi whatsap group bhi tha jisamen bahut kuch share hota tha
 He also used to say that Alok Verma helps Subrata Roy and Subrata Roy help him
 yani tihaad jail main ek badi lobby thi jo alok verma ko eemaandaar afasar nahin maanati thi
 However, if 2 groups are formed in any institution, then it is common to accuse each other
 haalanki verma par aise hi aarope ek lobby tab lagaati rahi jab ve dilli police kamishnar the
 When he was DG Tihar Jail, there was some news everyday in Tihar Jail
 kabhi hatya to kabhi kaidiyon kaa bhaagna,or kabhi kaidiyon ke bich gangvaar
 In a few months more than 15 prisoners had died
 hamaare liye ye ahm khabaren thim, lekin khabaren tihaad jail se milane kii bajaay dilli police mukhyalay se milteen thim
 That is, the center of leaking news was Delhi Police Headquarters, where a team of 3-4 big IPS officers used to do this job well
 shaayad ye isliye kiya jaataa rahaa ki alok verma ko media ke jariye itnaa badnaam kar diya jaae ki ve dilli police kamishnar na ban paaen
 The feud between the IPS lobby was old
 police mukhyalay kaaphi had tak apane mansoobon main kaamyaab hua bhi, lekin kismat ke dhani alok verma usee police mukhyalay main 29 farvari 2016 ko kamishnar banakar aa gaye
 His arrival proved to be a danger bell for many big IPS officers
 unhone aate hi sabase pehali meeting main special kamishnar dharmendra kumaar kii class le lee kyonki meeting main unke phone kii ghanti baj gai thi
 After this, Special Commissioner of the second camp Dharmendra Kumar and Special Commissioner Deepak Mishra got transferred, who were in the line of Police Commissioner before Alok Verma's arrival
 iske baad alok verma ne police mukhyalay main apni lobby ko khadaa karnaa shuru kiya
 There were many IPS officers in his good book who were promoted and respected during his tenure and those who were opposed went away one by one
 is bich asipi anil chatwaal sabase zyada charchaa main rahe
 It is said that Chatwal was the closest to Alok Verma and Chatwal looked after the transfer and posting work of everyone from constable to top
 kai log kehete the ki verma chatwaal ke saath milakar transfar posting industry chalaa rahe hai
 There is a saying about Alok Verma that he does not like to see the seven blood of his lobby which is forgiven and the face of his opponent
 iske baad alok verma kaa aglaa hamalaa hua dilli police ke media centre par, jiske mukhiya rajan bhagat the
 Verma used to feel that when he was DG Tihar, the news was coming against him, the elder officer has been planting the plant only through Rajan Bhagat
 afasaron ke mutabik unhen rajan bhagat ke chehre se bhi nafrat thi isliye ve rajan bhagat ko police mukhyalay se baahar karne kaa bahaanaa khoj rahe the
 One day Alok Verma's wife came to a family welfare program of Delhi Police
 us kaarykram kaa na to media main kawarej mila or na hi alok verma kii patni kaa photo kisi akhbaar main thik se chapa gaya
 Alok Verma took the excuse of displeasure and sent Rajan Bhagat to the post of CRO in the office of Kamla Market Crime Branch outside the police headquarters
 media main kai log alok verma ko transfar seepi kehete the kyonki dilli police ke hi kai afasaron kii maane to verma ne apane kareebi anil chatwaal ke jariye jo transfar posting kaa khel khelaa, vah apane aap main ek record tha
 Varma did thousands of transfers during his 11-month tenure
 yahi nahin verma ne sibiai nideshak banane kaa order aane ke baad bhi police mukhyalay charge chhodane ke pehle apane aakhri din tak transfar kii list nikaali
 According to sources, in these days, he transferred 12 shos, which is usually not done by any police commissioner
 haa verma ke kaarykaal main ek kaam kii jarur saraahna hui, jo tha grih mantralay se hari jhandi milane ke baad 25000 police karmiyon kaa ek saath pramotion
 They will be remembered for this
 ipies afasaron kii maane to verma kaa tikat dilli police kamishnar se jab nideshak sibiai ke liye kataa to unke pankh lag gaye
 It is said that on the go, he also got the police commissioner of his choice and in this way the coin of Verma continued in the Delhi Police
 unki lobby ke log dilli police main aaj bhi malaaidaar posting kaat rahe hai
 How much he has got in the Delhi Police can be gauged from the fact that outside his house two police officers from the IB were publicly mistreated by police personnel
 unki pahchaan media main dikhaa di gai lekin pulicekarmiyon kaa kuch nahin hua
 Today, many police officers, who consider themselves Verma's persecuted, are saying on condition of anonymity, "it is what they do
" verma tihaad jail ke diji the or lagata he ab phir tihaad jaaenge
 "but there is a second lobby in the Delhi Police which is the most powerful at the moment, it is very desperate for the removal of Alok Verma
 unhen lagata he ki ab unki takat kam hogi
 On one side, the quarrel between Delhi Government and Lieutenant Governor

 In the midst of his first term as the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy, Narendra Modi, like Decathlon, has to show his all-round talent and stamina to prove his complete hold on the task that In some respects it can be called the world's most difficult task
 modi ko ek dhaavak kii tarah teji se ek ke baad ek kai baadhaon ko paar karte hue un tamaam kaaryakramon ke liye jan sweekruti hasil kerani hoti he jinka unhone elaan kiya he
 They must also have the stamina of a long distance runner

 They also have to demonstrate the strength and agility required for field events to overcome all the challenges they face, be it cross-border terrorism or economic stability, social tension or religious harmony
 champion banakar ubharne ke liye modi ko or bhi dheron mukaable jeetne hai
 Modi's popularity had skyrocketed in India Today's nation's mood opinion poll three months after he took the throne in May 2014 and put more than 336 seats won in the NDA alliance 
 magar uske baad unki jeet ke saath ai viraat aakankshaon par khara utarane kaa dabaav tari hone laga
 As Modi's inability to bring in "good days" grew more and more eagerly, his government's popularity in three mood surveys of three countries spiked at an interval of six months
 farvari 2016 ke surveykshan main loksabhaa main endie kii siton kii ginati ghatakar 286 par aa gai thi or unke bahumat kaa fark bahut kam rah gaya tha
 The bjp's share fell far below the majority it got in the 2014 general elections
 modi ke liye isse badtar yah hua ki loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 59 siten jitkar apane sabase nichle str par pahunch chuke congress kii aguai vaale upie main phir se ji uthne ke sanket dikhne lage
 His seat count reached double the seats won in the election
 rahul gandhi kii siyaasi kismat main khaasi oochaal dikhaai dene lagi
 He emerged as a big challenger to Modi
 ab jab modi apane pradhanmantri kaarykaal ke madhya padaav par pahunch rahe hai, unke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki india today-karvi incits kaa tazatreen desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan bataata he ki pradhanmantri ne phir majbootee ke saath vaapasi kii hai
 The survey estimates that the NDA will get 304 seats if elections are held now: a significant improvement of 18 seats from the February 2016 survey
 modi ke liye ek or ahm baat yah he ki pichley surveykshanon main congress or rahul gandhi kaa jo nae sire se ubhaar dikhaai diya tha, vah thahar gaya he
 The UPA count of seats has come down and it has come down to 100
 modi ke liye yah baat bhi utsaah badhaane vaali he ki unki lokapriyata kii reating 10 fisadi kii lambii chalaang bharkar phir 50 fisadi par pahunch gai he, jabaki unke chalanger khaskar rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main giravat ai he
 The mighty leader of the Third Front, who had won the recent state assembly elections, be it Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal or j in Tamil Nadu
 jayalalita or usase pehle bihar main nitish kumaar hon yaa dilli main arvind kejariwal, modi or endie sarkaar ke awwal hone ko chunauti dene kii haalat main dikhaai nahin de rahe hai
 Nitish and Kejriwal, however, are narrowing their distance from Rahul as the most powerful opposition leader to face Modi when he tries to re-elect in the 2019 election
 jahaan yah mana gaya ki endie sarkaar pichley chah maheenon main apane kaamkaaj main sudhaar laai he, vahiin modi ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki surveykshan ke mutabik log naukariyaan, mahangaai or bhrashtachar sareekhe ahm muddon par santusht nahin hai (saath kii reportein dekhen)
 The bjp's seat count is still below the majority, so it relies on the nda's allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha
 isliye modi or bijepi ko vah jameen ab bhi dobaaraa hasil kerani he jo unhone satta main apane pichley do saalon ke dauraan ganvaa di he
 The most evident of Modi's rise in popularity is what the election pundit called "tina", or the Factor of Optionlessness
 agar aap siyaasi falak par najar daalen, to party ke bheetar or baahar modi ke varchasv ko koi gambhir chunauti dene vaala nahin he
 Modi had got the mandate to form the government on his own with such a huge and clear majority in 30 years, the big reason behind this was that people wanted a leader at the top of the government to decide, who ruled the UPA-2 Prevented the plight experienced during the period and brought the economy back on the path of high growth with jobs and prosperity
 lekin kheti-kisaani ke morche par silsilewar uthaae gaye kuch galat kadamon, do lagaataar sookhe se haalat or bigadgaye, dilli or bihar kii chunavi haar or ''suut-boot kii sarkaar" hone kii dharna kii vajah se modi sarkaar kii lokapriyata ne teji ne ghota lagaaya
 However, the prime minister's personal popularity remained high even in the meantime
 kya koi vikalp nahin hone kii kiafiyat maujuuda surveykshan ke is virodhabhas ko puri tarah se samajha paati he ki modi or endie jarur majbootee se phir ubharkar aae hai, magar yah dharna ab bhi kaayam he ki unki sarkaar ko kai ahm muddon par abhi nattejey dene baaki hai? bijepi kaa majboot vikalp khadaa karne main vipaksh kii naakaami ko dekhte hue dosha or kalank ke baavjood modi ko ab bhi sabase awwal netaa kii tarah dekha jaataa he jo is mushkil or aajamaaish bhare daur se raashtra ko baahar nikaal saktaa he
 Still, finding the return of this "tina" factor would be unfair to Modi
 ve hameshaa morche par aage rahakar to aguai karte hi hai, vahiin pichley chah maheenon main modi ne dikhaaya he ki unhone apni galatiyon se siikhaa he or apni sarkaar ko tej rakrataar di he
 He flashed his anti-farmer and anti-poor image by allocating the largest amount of lump sum since independence to strengthen the agricultural sector and poverty alleviation
 unhone arthvyavastha main teji laane or rojgaar paidaa karne ke liye sadak, rail, bandargah or awaas ke liye buniyadi dhaanche kii pariyojnaon main sarkari khajaane kii baari-bharkam dhanrashiyaan jhonk deen
 Modi then moved forward with courage and opened up important sectors of the economy to foreign direct investment
 alpiji kii keemten badhaate hue or rasoi gas kii sabsidi ko jaruratmandon tak simit karte hue ve kathor faisle lene se bhi dare nahin
 Modi also got rid of his opposition to the opposition more or less and with the help of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, passed the GST Bill from Parliament and heralded the biggest economic reform in recent times
 ''ek raashtra ek kar" kii is yojana main na sirf desh ke jatil kar dhaanche ko saral banane ke beej chhipe hai, balki isse kaarobaar karne main aasaani hogi, upabhokta ke liye laagat main sambhawatah kami aegi or aarthik vruddhi ko oochaal milegi
 The result is that Modi's management of the macroeconomy is seen as solid and robust, despite the rbi's handling of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan poorly
 arthvyavastha kii chote arase kii sehat ke teenon ahm sanketak achche mukaam par hai
 Although inflation has not been achieved, it is still within the comfort level
 vetan ayog se hui tankhwaahon main badhotaree or ''ek rank ek pension" ke bhugtan ke baavjood chaalu khate kaa ghaataa or saath hi rajkoshiya ghaataa bhi kaabo main bana hua he
 And whatever measure of GDP growth you can measure, it is still 7
 5 fisadi ke sehatmand str par he or bharat ko duniya kii sambhawatah sabase tej badhati arthvyavastha kaa darja detii he, vah bhi aise vakt main jab antarrashtriya maahaul anukool nahin he
 Good economics is also good politics
 alabatta lambey arase ke gambhir mudde bhi hai jin par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Unemployment is rising to frightening levels and growth without jobs is confusing the government
 bainkon kaa karjon ke jaal main fansaa hona chintaa kii badi vajah he jisase karj kii uplabdhta par sankat mandara rahaa he
 The pace of industrial growth remains sluggish and so is the state of exports
 companiyaan bhugtan ko lekar jhagadon main uljhi hai jiske chalate buniyadi dhaanche kii badi pariyojnaayen adalati adchanon main fansi hai
 The government will have to come up with innovative measures to break the deadlock
 iske liye use aisi companiyon ko guarantee par dhan muhaiyaa karwaanaa hoga or panchat kii prakriya main haarane par maamalon ko supreme court main le jane se pehle doordarshita se kaam lenaa hoga
 Despite the promises, the government still has a greater presence in the business
 modi kii visheshta yah he ki ve kabhi thakte nahin hai, chizon ko vistaar se samajhnaa chaahate hai, rajnatik sooyeeboojh rakhte hai, or teji se vikaas ke liye purna rup se patibaddh hai
 He calls himself "the man who stands behind the line"
 unke cabinet mantri piyush goyal bataate hai ki baithkon main pradhanmantri teen chizon par jor dete haih mujhe parinaam bataao, yah bataao ki aap kitni teji se kaam kar rahe hai, or aap unhen kitna acha kar sakate hai
 In the past year, Modi seems to have managed to clamp the bureaucracy
 sarkaar main oonche str par bhrashtachar par lagaam lagaai ja chuki he or zyaadaatar badi niyuktiyaan yogyata ke aadhaar par kii ja rahi hai
 The results of most programs like Swachh Bharat and Jan Dhan Yojana launched in the first phase are now visible
 swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par nirarthak baaten bolne ke bajaae pradhanmantri ne is avasar kaa istemaal desh kii pragati kii report pesh karne ke liye kiya
 Although some people said that his speech was excessively long, but the truth is that he had a lot to tell the country
 vikaas ke alaava, unhone ek varisht adhikari ke shabdon main ''thali test" par jor diya taaki log har din vaazib keemton par bhojan paa saken
 The Prime Minister's Office is concerned with the rising prices of pulses and vegetables, but due to the good monsoon, the prices are expected to come under control
 videsh niti ke morche par modi kaa kaam nirantar shandaar bana hua he, jaisaa ki ek ucch adhikari ne bataaya ki ''ve hameshaa aage badhkar khelnaa pasand karte hai
 "modi's theory that instead of becoming a balancing country, India should become a leading power and the result of this principle is also visible
 saath hi ve sabhi deshon ke saath sahyog kaa vyaavhaarik ravaiya bhi rakhte hai
 Despite some poor experiences with neighboring countries, especially Pakistan, the mood survey of the country shows that people are very happy with their work in terms of foreign policy
 modi sankat se kinaaraa karne ke bajaae use chunauti ke rup main lenaa pasand karte hai or jab duusare rashtradhyakshon se milte hai to badi safagoi se apni baat rakhte hai, jaisaa ki unhone parmaanu aapurti samooh ke mudde par china ke netritv ke saath kiya
 They have forged a strong synergy between domestic goals and foreign policy and have managed to gain the confidence of foreign investors and increase in foreign investment
 ve jokhim uthaane se jaraa bhi nahin darate or jarurat padane par takat kaa pradarshan karne se nahin hichakate
 After the Pakistani army's setback to efforts to establish peace in the region, Modi questioned Pakistan's claim on human rights abuses and pok by Pakistan in Balochistan
 haa, jab ve apane kaarykaal ke najuk uttarardh kii taraf bad rahe hai to bahut-si gharelu samasyaayein unke peeche lagi hui hai
 Although it is good to give a stern message to Pakistan, yet his government will be held responsible for the deteriorating situation in Kashmir, where BJP is a part of the state government
 iske alaava gujarat main jis tarah unki pasand ke uttaradhikari ne prashasan par apana niyantran kho diya tha, vah bhi chintaa kii baat he
 This led to a change in leadership there
 unhone aakhirkaar jis tarah se gorakshakon kii ore se daliton par hamalon kaa khulkar virodh kiya, usase bhi unki kaaphi tarif hui he
 But in the same way, if they raise the voice for Muslims too, then it will be better as a leader with a big heart
 desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main ye chintaaen bhi pratibimbit hoti hai
 Muslims and other minorities have expressed their grievances
 surveykshan sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke madhya main kiya gaya he, jo dobaaraa chunaav jeetne kii sarkaar kii yogyata kaa ek mahatvapurn suchak sabit ho saktaa he
 The survey conducted in the middle of Manmohan Singh's second term as Prime Minister showed a huge decline in the popularity of the Congress-led government
 bhrashtachar ke dheron aaropon se ghiri upie kii siton kii sankhya 2009 ke aam chunaavon main 259 se ghatakar agast, 2011 ke surveykshan main 197 ho gai thi
 The Congress ignored that warning and in 2014 had to face the worst defeat
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main endie sarkaar ne bhi agast 2001 main apane kaarykaal ke madhya main isi tarah kaa rujhaan dikhaaya tha
 The poll saw signs of a drastic decline in its electoral prospects — the government had then received an average of 217 seats, compared to 304 seats in the 1999 general elections
 teen saal baad ''bharat udai" ke joardaar prachaar ke baavjood endie ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In contrast, when the survey was conducted in the middle of the first term of the UPA, it saw signs of rapid increase in its seats, and in 2009 it won the re-election
 modi ne kaarykaal ke madhya main lagata he apni sarkaar kaa akalan kar liya he
 They take tough decisions, speak the mind, and are moving fast on the path of development
 ab phir se jab desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan unke paksh main jaataa dikh rahaa he to modi ko mukhya muddon par teji se kaam karnaa chahie, jisase unhen hameshaa bharat ke pradhanmantri ke taur par dekha jaae, na ki kisi ek khaas party, khaas kshetra, khaas gut yaa samudaay ke pradhanmantri ke taur par
 Only then will they be able to win the 2019 elections
 dilli main vaayu pradooshan ko kam karne ko lekar hai court ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki diwaali ke baad fasal katni shuru ho jaaegi or phir use kheton main jalaayaa jayega
 In such a situation, to save the capital from pollution, steps should be taken by talking to the states to stop it
 court ne kaha ki dilli ke baahar ke pradeshon se aane vaala pradooshan phir dilli ko pradooshit kare, usase pehle kendriya pradooshan board ko rajyon ke saath milakar ise rokane ke liye kadam uthaanaa chahie
 The High Court said that the pollution coming from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh has an effect on Delhi's air
 board ne kaha- ye rajya kii jimmedaarihai court ne sawaal kiya ki jab fasal ko jalaana bain he to phir kisaan fasalon ko kyon jala rahe hai? rajya sarkaron se kendriya pradooshan board kyon sakhti se is aadesh kaa paalan nahin karvaa rahaa he? is par kendriya pradooshan board ne kaha ki ye jimmedaari rajya sarkaron kii he
 'bring the remedy next time' The High Court said that burning the crop is the cheapest and simplest solution for the farmers
 sarkaar kyon unhen koi or vaikalpik upaay nahin de rahi he
 Government can give any subsidy to them or impose penalty on them so that they do not burn the crop in the field
 hai court dilli me lagaataar bad rahe vaayu pradooshan se judi ek yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The court said that on the next hearing, the court wants to know the answer from all the parties, how can crop burning be stopped? 22 sitambar ko court maamle main dobaaraa sunwaayee karegi
 a few days ago the National Green Tribunal has also banned the burning of crops in the fields
 lekin uske baad bhi dilli se jude rajyon me crop burning par lagaam nahin lagaai ja saki he

 Reacting to the big revelation of 'aaj Tak', Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that if anyone runs a medical college in Uttar Pradesh illegally, then it will have to be closed
 aapako bataa den ki aaj tak ne medical collejon main daakhile ke gorakhdhandhe kaa khulaasa kiya he
 The Health Minister further said, "the Medical Council of India plays a role in the licensing process, but i assure that the law is strict and appropriate action will be taken if any colleges are run in this manner
 agar aparaadhik karrwai bhi banati he to vah bhi kadam uthaaenge
 Through you we will get the report and through that we will take action
 abhi to aapane saboot die nahin aap saboot dijie or ham log bhi aashwaasan dete hai ki ham thos karrwai karenge
 "apart from this, while giving his response to the sting, Director of Medical Education k Singh said that he is watching the sting of the Medical College at Aajtak
 ve is sting par sangyaan lenge or sambandhit medical college ko notice bhejenge
 Let us tell you that in the series of revolutionary revelations of 'revolutionary very revolutionary' program of 'aaj Tak', the issue of playing with the health of India has been shown on Thursday
 kaarykram main dikhaaya gaya ki embibies main daakhile kii neet kii prakriya kaise majaak banakar rah gai he
 And how the MBBS seat is being auctioned for one crore each
 or wo bhi farji vaali
 It was shown in the sting that how the colleges which do not have the right of admission have come down on extortion
 ajtak ke is krantikari stig report ne hindustan kii sehat se khilne vaale medical collejon kii pole kholkar rakh diya he
 The sporting of medical seats which came to the fore in the sting has shown how the brokers are roaming around to sell MBBS degrees in fake colleges
 or log bacchon ko chor daravaaje se doctor banane ke liye ghar-makaan tak bechney ko taiyaar hai
 The Ministry of Health of India has written a letter to KM Medical College, Mathura, stating that you cannot take admission in MBBS for two years
 lekin jab ajtak kii team is hukum ke taamil kaa sach jaanane pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki iskaa koi matlab nahin
 The college is giving admission as well as degree
 karodon rupye kaa yah khel farji embibies degree kaa kaarkaana ban gaya he
 In a letter written on 31 May 2017, the Ministry of Health of India has clearly written in black and bold letters that Krishna Mohan Medical College of Mathura cannot take admission in any Surat till 2019
 itnaa hi nahin sarkaar ne do karod rupye kii uski guarantee bhi jabt kar lee he
 But the college tore this letter into four pieces and put it in dustbin
 iske saboot jutaney ke liye ajtak kii special investigeshan team embibies seat kii kharidaar banakar mathura pahunchi
 Date - July 11, 2017 - Two o'clock in the afternoon - in the admission room of Krishna Mohan Medical College, Sonk Road, Mathurakrishna Mohan Medical College, the team till date got a person named Ajay Tomar
 usne apane aapako embibies admician kaa incharge bataaya
 The team teased the child's admission in MBBS
 ajay tomars-aap koun hai bachche ke?reporter-ankal harrjay-aap kahaan cereporter–dilli seajay-baccha kahaan par hareporter-dilli mechajay-acha 
 
 thik he online registration to kiya hogis sawaal ke aage ek admician incharge embibies seat kaa dalal ban gaya tha
 And when the admission charge was broker, the team also opened the whole thing
 reporter-dekho uskaa number to aayegaa nahin hamen maaloom hryjay-ham college level par couseling karavaaenge
 If you book a child, we have it
 abhi to ham college level par couseling karavaayenge bachche kii
 After that the secret was opened, which the team went to investigate
 ajay-jo registration aapane online kiya he uskaa form laga dijiega
 He will be one
 neet kaa score
 And you will have to submit a document and deposit Rs 5 lakh cash for booking the seat
 ofter dait, check dene hai aapako
 Full fee to confirm seat
 jab seat conform ho jayega to phul pidi dene hai
 Reporter - We consider and tell you next week, Ajay - Next week i will tell you next week
 ye to aaj kii he
 i will tell you tomorrow also
 sits ke upar depend karata he
 Reporters will be here
 
 The All will be here? Junaid - everything here is a reportor - so in five years, i will become a doctor
 
 junaid-ofcourse cannot grant degree
 Let us tell you again that KM Medical College of Mathura cannot offer MBBS degree
 upar se supreme court kii saaf guideline he ki jo bhi daakhile honge wo neet ke score ke aadhaar par honge
 Now know the reason why KM Medical College cannot offer MBBS degree
 embibies chhodie compoundari kaa certificate nahin de saktaa
 In fact, the MCI team randomly examined KM Medical College at three different times
 pataa chalaa 86 fisadi faikalti kii kami he
 Meaning, the college that makes the doctor does not have teachers
 professor chhodie resident doctor kii kami bhi 90 fisad pai gai

 To manage the fund for the Kalia scheme, the government has issued a notification on 15 January from the Odisha Contingency Fund for Rs 735 crore

 However, the BJP disagrees

 However, the Odisha Contingency Fund Act of 1967 allows the state governor to take an advance from the contingency fund to meet any unexpected expenditure

 Opposition parties, particularly the BJP, have alleged that the trick to fill the pockets of many fake beneficiaries has gone under the guise of Kalia
 acharya kehete hai, ''koi surveykshan nahin kiya gaya
 The list is being prepared by the panchayats and we doubt that the money will be sent to the account of the ruling party workers instead of the eligible beneficiary farmers

 Principal Secretary (agriculture) Sanjay Garg said that the beneficiary list is based on the data of registered farmers available with the administration

 During this, Aarushi died and Hemraj fainted
 iske baad talwaar danpati ne hemraj ko chat par le jaakar uskaa sargical blade se galaa ret diya or neeche aakar aarushi kaa bhi galaa ret diya
 According to CBI, Aarushi's mother Nupur also acted to erase evidence
 unhone aarushi ke privet part kii safai kii or phir aarushi ko kapade pahanaae
 The CBI gave the clean chit, now the murderer is saying that Talwar's lawyer has asked 50-60 questions to the investigating officer of CBI
 unke vakil tanwir ahamed mir ne jirah kii jaankaree di
 He told that the CBI which till now had been talking about not getting evidence in this murder mystery and had also given a clean chit to the Talwar couple, now the same CBI is describing the Talwar couple as the murderer
 sidhaa saboot ab bhi nahin he
 Now it remains to be seen what the defense does to cut cbi's arguments and the biggest question is whether Aarushi will ever get justice

 "I would have loved to win the 50-over World Cup," said one of the most artistic batsmen in the cricket world, at his farewell press conference
 hamaare paas do maukey the lekin ham chook gaye
 It would have been fantastic if we had won the series against India on its soil
 isliye kuch chijen hai jo ho sakati thi lekin meraa maananaa he ki khel isi tarah se aage badhata he
 Sangakkara said that he is malicious but did not sleep on his nights

 i had a wonderful career
 maine haar or jeet prayek kaa lutf uthaaya
 It was a great experience on both the good and bad days
 ' unhone kaha, videshi sarajameen visheshkar austrailia main kuch test match jeetna acha rahata
 i remember last year's tour of England when we won 1-0
 vah meraa sarvshereshth videshi daura rahaa
 Talking about the good and bad times of his career, Sangakkara mentioned the heartbreaking incident of the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in 2009 in Lahore
 unhone kaha, 'vah nishchit taur par hamaare liye behad daraavna pal tha

 Talking about the Sri Lankan team's rivalry against India, Sangakkara said, "it was a great rivalry"
 yah kuch mahaan khiladiyon ke bich muqabla tha
 When you face a team that has batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly in their batting order, then you know that it is very difficult for you

 Trott has said that he is taking a break from cricket to overcome the problem until it is inconclusive
 england evam wales cricket board (isibi) ne trot kii vaapasi kii pushti kii he or saath hi yah bhi kaha he ki vah ab baaki ke maichon ke liye australia nahin lautenge
 Trott was dismissed cheaply in the first Test match played in Brisbane
 england ko pehle match main 381 ranon se karaari shikast mili thi
 Trott was dismissed by Mitchell Johnson in both innings on short pitch balls
 trot ne apane bayaan main kaha, "yah jaanate hue ki main team ko 100 fisadi yogadan nahin de paa rahaa hum, mere liye is shrunkhlaa main khelte rahanaa thik nahin hota
 i have not been able to perform the level that i have touched in the past
 " "my only goal is to take a break from cricket and prepare myself for cricket again
 main apane saathiyon ko baaki kii shrunkhlaa ke liye shubhakamana de rahaa hum
 " english team prabandhan ko is baat kii jaankaree thi ki trot kisi tarah kii maansik pareshaani se guzar rahe hai or is sambandh main team nideshak endi flower or isibi ke prabandh nideshak hag moris ne brisben test ke dauraan hi trot se baat kii thi
 The ECB has stated that it respects Trott's sentiments and hopes that in the new year Trott will return to international cricket with renewed hope and a desire to do something for the team

 Rishi Kapoor was just 16 years old and studying in school, when he got my name in Joker
 ranbir kapur sirf 15 varsh ke the, jab unke pita ne unhen apane diarection main banane vaali pehali film aa ab laut chalem kaa assistant diarector banaaya
 Both films were average but both stars rose
 60 varshiya rishi kapur kaa sambhavat: bollywood main ek romantic hero ke rup main sabase lanbaa kariyar rahaa he
 Ranbir Kapoor, on the other hand, has become an actor who takes surprising risks after his debut with Saawariya
 ranbir ke sharir main gusse kaa tatv nahin he to rishi screen se baahar kii duniya main sharaab or asuraksha kii buraaiyon se jujhate rahe hai
 Nevertheless both live under one roof in a well furnished cottage at Pali Hill
 rishi or ranbir ne apni filmon kramash: aurangzeb or ye javaani he divaani ke shooting shedul se samay nikaala or apane ghar se thodi dur par sthit ek hotel ke kamare main ek ghante tak baatcheet kii
 Talking to him was such an experience as if an interesting tennis match was going on
 india today kii editor kaveri bamajai mantrmugdh hokar yah dekh rahi thim
 How was the reaction about Student of the Year? Rishi Kapoor i don't know, you tell
 ranbir kapoormujhe yah film pasand ai
 Rishivah is speaking because the father is sitting next to him
 ranbirmujhe koi ummid nahin thi, lekin yah acchhee or mjedaar lagi
 Probably because your friend Karan Johar is its director
 ranbirlekin main unki filmon kaa eemaandaaree se akalan karata hum
 What about Barfi? Ranbir Jahan as far as my films are concerned, i myself do not come to any conclusion
 maine darshakon ke saath apni filmein dekhne kaa nirnay liya he or iske baad hi raay banaata hum
 i saw Barfi in Delhi
 darshak kaaphi bandhe hue the
 What do you think about Agneepath? You should have been uncomfortable seeing your father in a scene in which he is so aggressive about a small girl? Ranbirnah, no
 main khud ek actor hum
 Rishiham knows that all this is acting
 aap kis baat se naaraaz hote hai?rishihar cheez se
 i am basically an angry man
 tab to aapako sattar ke dashak kaa engri main hona chahie tha
 What were you doing while Nachna, song, romance with Neetu
 rishiyah sab ek actor ko karnaa padataa he
 But that was a period of fun, especially in terms of clothes
 tadak-bhadak vaale jacket
 You will still be wearing it in a museum
 karj vaali jacket?rishihamane isi tarah kii karj vaali jacket bhartiya antarrashtriya film academy (iiefe) aword ke liye taiyaar kiye, jahaan ham donon ne dance kiya
 And these jackets were exchanged
 maine tite jacket pahana tha or usne dhilaa vaala
 It's a good thing
 ranbir kaa vajan zyada nahin he
 Are you happy with this? Rishivah has gone on her mother
 uskaa metabolism kaaphi acha he
 Ranbir It is also a matter of fact that people are more aware these days
 rishiun dinon ham patale to nahin the, lekin swasth the
 This is a new era for you: to be a bad man
 lekin kya vah kabhi aap par (ranbir se sawaal) chikhe hai?ranbiranhin, unhone mujhase kabhi bhi oonchi aawaaj main baat nahin kii he
 Can you say for sure? Because he always shouts at others? Rishi: No, he is giving diplomatic answers
 mujhe ek baar mere pita ne thappad lagaaya tha kyonki maine kaaphi kam umr main hi unke mechap main se cigarette mangakar pi thi
 The same happened with him (ranbir), when he went to the room of Pooja wearing shoes
 tab aap kitne varsh ke the
 i would have been 12 years old
 jab aapane bathroom ke pot par girakar gaal ko jakhmi kiya tha, usase pehle?rishitab to vah sirf do-teen varsh kaa tha
 In a way, he had destroyed our rented house in London
 jab vah paanch varsh kaa tha to usne frij kaa darwaja tod diya
 Once we went to a restaurant, he sat demanding a guitar
 usne kuch bhi nahin khaaya or lagaataar rota rahaa
 It was raining isliye hamen use guitar dilaane ke liye puure landan ke chakkar kaatane pade
 What motivated you (ranbir) to get into acting? Ranbir: i think it started when i was not doing well in school
 padhai main meri ruchi thi, lekin skool janaa mujhe boriyat bharaa lagata tha
 When i moved to New York, i became more responsible for myself
 mujhe lagata he ki jab aap parivaar kii chaaya se dur hote hai or jivan ko behatar tareeke se jite hai to har saal zyada jimmedaar hote jate hai
 How did they live four years in New York? Rishimeri's daughter had gone abroad before Ranbir
 isliye ham maansik rup se taiyaar the
 He went to the Lee Strasbourg Theater and Film Institute, which was not compatible with my acting patterns
 yah ek methd skool tha
 But we let him do what he wanted
 waapas aane par usne blike main sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath bataur assistant diarector kaam kiya
 After this Bhansali took him to Sanwaria
 saanwariyaa par pratikriya mili-juli thi
 Rishipratikriya was not mixed, bad
 aap isse niraash hue?rishijab hamane film dekhi, to hamen abhas ho gaya ki vah hamaare parivaar kaa he or apana kaam jaanata he
 i was confident that he would take the right direction
 usne jo agali film chuni, bachanaa i haseenon, vah romantic film thi
 But she was discussed a lot in Wake Up Sid? Rishim i do not interfere in her creative side or in any other way
 meri pasand ho saktaa he ki is nai peedi ke liye sahi na ho
 i never wanted him to do a film like Wake Up Sid
 lekin aapane vek ap cid kab dekhi? vah seen jisamen vah apane pita kaa virodh karte hai
 
 
 Rishihan, that moment
 vastav main aise pal hi kisi film ko bada banaate hai
 The story may be a little unnecessary
 mujhe ajab prem kii gajab kahani pasand ai
 This is my kind of film
 main hameshaa yah chahta tha ki vah rishi kapur style kii romantic filmein kare
 Have you met his girlfriends? Rishim i do not know which girl is his girlfriend
 usne mujhase kabhi yah nahin kaha ki yah meri garlfriend he
 But i presume that at this age he will have not one, but many girlfriends
 aisa kyon?rishijab vah kisi garlfriend ko patni bananaa chahega, tab baat alag hogi
 What is your view of his work? kya aap unke saath ise saajha karte hai?rishimain nahin jaanata
 i am really sad about this
 hamaare bich dosti nahin he
 Probably because my father did not befriend me
 main use pyaar karata hum
 He is my only son
 lekin vah maa ke zyada kareeb he
 If you were working today and you would get opportunities in the same way that the son is getting, the kind of director he is working with and with a tremendous script, then what role would you like for yourself ? Rishimuzhe liked her roles in Politics, Barfi and Rockstar
 maine anjaanaa anjaani par bahut dhyaan nahin diya he
 Did you enjoy working in the unknown film? Unknown: You have to surrender completely while doing Ranbirfilm
 vahi karnaa hota he, jo diarector chahta he
 As an actor, you cannot judge your films
 isliye unke (rishi) dekhne kaa intjaar karata hum
 Rishimeri wife is the best judge

 The regulator has recently asked all operators to provide information about their charges electronically as well as physically
 iskaa makasad bhautik rup se file kiye jane kii vyavastha ko charanbaddh tareeke se samaapt karnaa he
 According to some estimates, about 24,000 rates are reported annually by telecom companies
 isamen sabhi parichaalkon ke liye vibhinn cirkil ke liye shulk yojana ke saath-saath vishesh shulk vauchar shaamil hai
 Sharma told PTI, "trai's website will not only show transparent charges but we will probably provide machine readable data which can be exported to others so that people can make applications on it

 pakistan kii test team (pakistan Test Team) ke purv captain salmaan bat (salman Butt) ne kaha he ki bharat kii test cricket main safalataa main uske majboot gharelu dhaanche (strong domestic structure) kii ahm bhoomika he
 He has said that unless the structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan is strengthened like that of India, we cannot expect a similar performance from our players here
 spot phixing maamle (spot Fixing Scandal) main pratibandh kaa saamana kar chuke salmaan bat ke anusaar, adhikansh khilaadi desh main chaar divasiy cricket khilne se bachate hai
 Significantly, last month Pakistan suffered a 1-2 defeat in the three-test series against New Zealand, while the team also lost the first Test against South Africa by six wickets at Centurion last week
 daagi pakistani cricketer salmaan bat ne kaha, cricket bhrashtachar se kabhi mukt nahin ho saktadusari ore, bharat ne melbern main australia ke khilaaf teesraa test 137 ran se jitkar chaar maichon kii siries main 2-1 se ajey badhat banaai or border-gavaskar trophy apane paas barkaraar rakhi
 Butt, who played 33 Tests and 78 odis during his international career, said, 'see when India recently won the Test against Australia, Virat Kohli credited India's domestic cricket success in bowling and batting
 'unhone kaha, ‘bharat isliye acha kar rahaa he kyonki unke khilaadiyon ko sirf ipel tii20 cricket main khilne kii sweekruti he or unhen ranjai trophy khelni hoti he jabaki iske vipareet hamaare yahaan adhikansh khilaadi chaar divasiy gharelu cricket main khilne se bachate hai

 Public will see all pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee shanivaar ko kolkata ke brigade parade ground main vipakshi dalon ko ek saath ek manch par laane ke liye raily kar rahi hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, in opposition solidarity against the BJP, political parties, BJP rebels and anti-modi leaders are also coming together
 lekin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se lekar telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav sahit vipaksh ke kareeb 7 aisa netaa hai jo mamata banerjee ke manch par najar nahin aaenge
 Political significance is also hidden behind these leaders not reaching Mamta's rally
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipakshi ekta ke shakti pradarshan karne ke liye mamata banerjee mahareli karne ja rahi hai
 Lakhs of people are said to be involved in this Maharali, besides leaders of almost all parties of opposition parties will gather
 haalanki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi, basapa adhyaksh mayawati, tiares chif va telugana ke mukhyamantri kesiar or jagan mohan reddy is raily main shaamil nahin ho rahe hai
 Apart from this, there is doubt about the involvement of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik
 vahiin, diemke ke is manch par aane se AIADMK ne duuri bana rakhi he
 Why not on sonia-rahul Mamta's platform, the biggest reason behind Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi not reaching Mamta's platform is being considered as the West Bengal Committee of Congress
 pashchim bengal congress cameti mamata kii raily main rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke shaamil hone ko lekar sahamat nahin tha
 It is being told that the Congress Committee of the state is ready to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections alone and it is he who suggested Rahul Gandhi not to attend the rally, after which he decided not to attend
 haalanki, sonia-rahul ne apni jagah varisht netaa mallikarjun khadge ko bhejnaa kaa faisla kiya he
 Why Maya herself is not going to Mamata's stage but BSP President Mayawati is also not going to herself but instead is sending her to party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra
 basapa pramukh karnataka main congress-jedies sarkaar ke shapath grahan samaaroh ko chhodkar kisi or duusare manch par vipakshi netaaon ke saath nahin dikhi hai
 In fact, Mayawati is also presenting herself as a contender for the post of PM
 aise main wo kisi or se manch par jaakar apni majbootee ko kamjor nahin karnaa chaahati hai
 Chief Minister of Odisha and BJD President Naveen Patnaik may not be seen in the TMC rally on the path of Naveen Patnaik Ekla Chalo
 unhone india today mind rox kaarykram main kaha tha unki party kii niti saaf he, vah bijepi or congress se samaan duuri banaakar chal rahe hai
 They will not combine with either of the two parties
 iske alaava abhi tak vipaksh ke aise kisi bhi manch par nahin dikhe hai
 However, KCR to Mamta met Naveen Patnaik and invited him to join the Federal Front
 naidu ke chalate reddy ne banaai durimamta ke manch par andhra pradesh ke wiesar congress party ke adhyaksh va andhra pradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh wies jagan mohan reddy bhi najar nahin aaenge
 Actually, Mamata's rally is going to TDP President Chandrababu Naidu
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi ke chalate jagan mohan reddy is raily se duuri banaae hue hai, kyonki naidu se unka siyaasi virodh he
 Similarly, no leader of AIADMK will be seen in Mamta's rally, because DMK leader is reaching Stalin
 tamilnadu main donon dal ek- duusare ke virdohi hai, aise main donon dal ek manch par saath aane se gurej kar rahe hai
 While both DMK and AIADMK parties are against BJP
 manch par najar aaenge ye netatiemasi kii raily main sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav, basapa ke satish chandra mishra, echdi kumaraswami, echdi devgauda, arvind kejariwal, sharad pavaar, chandrababu naidu, faruk abdulla, umr abdulla, tejasvi yadav, stallin, mallikarjun khadge, ajit singh, jayant choudhary, sharad yadav, hemanth sorain, laladhuvahaavamaa or gegang apang upasthit honge
 Apart from these leaders, anti-modi leaders like Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani will also be involved
 iske alaava bijepi ke baagi netaaon main yashavanth sinha, shatrughna sinha or arun shouri bhi manch saajha karenge
 Every human has its own style

 If you make a demand on the right side? - Generally such people are Saturn-dominant - such people are very determined and hard-working, but they have to struggle a lot in the initial time of life- Anger and being overly stubborn Their biggest weakness is - such people are seen to have special benefits in the 32nd and 48th years of age - If you are having problems with conflict, change this style if you mother on the left Out what ajtak ke khaas kaarykram 'panchayat ajtak' main kendriya mantri arjuna ram meghavaal ne kaha ki congress ko modi phobia ho gaya he
 The public is happy with GST
 modi sarkaar ne menuphaccharing state par dhyaan dekar jiesti lagaaya
 Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka have the highest manufacturing, so the Modi government simplified the GST
 darasal, kendriya mantri ne ye baaten congress ke varisht netaa mohan prakaash ke 'jiesti or notebandi' ke bayaan par kahi
 Mohan Prakash had said that, 'GST and demonetisation have damaged the country's economy
 kaala dhan ko lekar bijepi ne badi baaten kar di

 The heated debate over the gravel scandal led to a heated debate between Congress leader Mohan Prakash and Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal over the power scandal
 kendriya mantri meghavaal ne kaha ki congress ne ankhen band karke mafiaon ko bajri ke patte die
 We have evidence that former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot gave gravel leases
 jamkar bandar baant hui or iskaa nuksaan logon ko hua
 At the same time, Mohan Prakash said that the BJP gave leases from 6 thousand to 40 thousand to the mafias
 bijepi ne chori kii he
 Now she is unable to hide it during election time
 sabko dikh rahaa he ki kisne bajri cond kiya
 Allegations on BJP - Friends ran away with the money of the country, the Congress surrounded the BJP and said that BJP had talked about bringing black money into the country before the elections

 The festival of lights was celebrated on Diwali Sunday
 shaam hote hi aatishbaajee bhi shuru ho gai, lekin diwali kii raat main dilli kii aabo hawa main jehar ghul gaya
 Ammo and smoke caused a lot of trouble to patients, children and the elderly
 diwali par kal dilli gas chambar main tabdeel ho gai
 In places like Punjabi Bagh, Mandir Marg, RK Puram, air quality had deteriorated several thousand times during the night
 'aaj tak' ne diwali par dilli main badhepradooshanaka pataa lagane ke liye centre for science and enwoyrement kii agxcutive diarector anumita roy choudhary baat kii
 During this time we learned from him how much environmental damage was caused by the firecrackers of Diwali
 anumita ne bataaya ki dilli kii bahut kharaab haalat he
 If you look at the day-long figures of Diwali, the pollution was very high during the night
 pataakhon se jo chemical nikalate hai, wo hawa main 20 ghante tak rahete hai
 We are all in his exposure
 20 ghante ke baad ye jameen, pani, subjiyon, ghaas, fasalon par aa jate hai
 Which enters our body through food and drink
 unhone bataaya ki ise lekar supreme court ne 2005 main guideline di he, lekin koi unka paalan nahin karata
 Where should the firecrackers be burnt, how long can we burn them, how to do the cell of the firecrackers, what should be the chemical combination? All these are mentioned in the guidelines
 lekin, sarkaar kaisaa kuch nahin kar pai he ki sakhti se ye lagu ho sake
 Anumita said that we talk about banning Chinese firecrackers, but we are not seeing what Chinese are doing
 aise vakt main wo un gadiyon kii sankhya kam kar dete hai, jisamen zyada dhuaan nikalataa he
 Shut down industrial units
 od-ivan shuru kar dete hai
 This is applicable not only in China but also in European countries
 hamaare yahaan bhi isaki shuruyaat honi chahie
 CSI Director Sunita Narayan said, we all know how harmful it is for children and the elderly
 sarkaar kii jo jimmedaari thi wo sarkaar ne puri nahin kii
 When the government does not want to do anything, then we should do something
 unhone kaha ki pataake kuch kam jalaae jate to aaj hawa itani jahrili nahin hoti
 i am fed up with saying that the government will have to be tough
 dilli main khaali bhagwaan bharose pradushan kam nahin hoga
 The government is not tied up, it lacks willpower
 logon ko hi aage aana hoga ki saaf hawa kaa unka adhikaar he

 baton ko samajhane kii unki kshamta laajawab thi
 At most it would have been that she would ask for some suggestions and then the decision was taken at that time
 ' All the senior bureaucrats of the state were convinced of their ability to understand the issues and the thought was resolved and their memory was also amazing
 in adhikariyon ke mutabik, jayalalita bilkul vyavasthit dhang se kaam karne main yakeen karti thim
 They state that the Chief Minister used to have a diary which contained the records of all the IPS (indian Police Service) officers of the state

 But his close and trusted people had considerable leeway, just had to tell Amma before they could do anything
 agar koi bhi jayalalita kaa bharosa kho detaa, to use nikaalane main vah jaraa bhi nahin hichakati thim
 For this reason, he had also severed ties with his close friend Sasikala Natarajan and adopted son VN Sudhakaran
 rajya ke tamaam varisht naukarshah muddon ko samajhane kii unki kaabiliyat or sulajhi hui soch ke kaayal the or unki yaaddasht bhi kamaal kii thi

 unhone 2001 se 2006 ke bich ke apane kaarykaal main apane purv sahyogi vaayako ko hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya tha
 Vaiko was accused of supporting the LTTE in one of his speeches
 jayalalita ke hi aadesh par saal 2013 main piemke netaa ramdaas or unke bete ambumani ko hinsa bhadakaane ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Getting access to Jayalalithaa was not a matter of everyone's bus
 lekin unke kareebi or bharosemand log ko kaaphi chhot hasil thi, bas unhen kuch karne se pehle ammaa ko bataanaa hota tha
 If anyone lost Jayalalithaa's trust, she was not at all hesitant to take him out
 isi vajah se unhone apni kareebi shashikala natarajan or dattak putr vien sudhakaran se bhi ek baar naata tod liya tha

 In the Lok Sabha elections, not only in Varanasi, the Modi wave in the whole of Uttar Pradesh is such that 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state came to bjp's account
 vidhansabha chunaavon ke najadik aate hi logon ke jehan main ek hi sawaal he kaashi kiski? kya kaashi kii janata bhaajapa ko jeet kaa sehara pahanayegi? kya kaashi main ek baar phir modi lahar chal paaegi?jati kabhi nahin jatesarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle ke baavjood sabhi rajnatik partiyaan tikat bantwaare main 'soshal ejineering' ke naam par jaateey sameekaran saadhane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Ticket candidates also show an increase in the number of voters of their caste so that they can win the 'first battle' (to win the trust of the party and get the ticket in their name)
 uttar pradesh main 2012 main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue the to samaajawaadee party ko 29
 13 percent and 25 to the BSP
 91 fisadi mat mili the
 BSP 29 in the 2007 assembly elections
 5, samaajawaadee party ko 25
 5 percent votes were received
 bijepi ko in donon chunaavon main 17 fisadi ke aasapaas mat mili the
 However, the Lok Sabha elections were reversed and BJP got 42
 3 fisadi or basapa ko 19
 5 per cent and SP 22
 6 fisadi mat praapt hue the
 For the next battle of vote bank, all the parties have started making efforts
 sapa apane vot bank ke pratishat ko atipichhadon ke jariye badhaane ke prayaas main lagi he to basapa ne is baar muslim or savarna (khaskar brahman) votbank saadhane ke liye nasimuddin or ramvir upaadhyaay ko jimmedaari saunp rakhi he
 It is certain that the head of the politics of UP will remain the same, which will have the utterance to put caste equations in its court

 BJP continued to occupy the Varanasi seat
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main congress ke haathon use shikast khaani padi
 In 2004, the Congress candidate from Varanasi seat, Dr
 rajesh kumaar mishra ne bhaajapa ke shankar prasad jaiswal ko haraaya tha
 Let us tell you that Shankar Prasad Jaiswal has won the 1996, 1998, 1999 elections
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main ek baar phir varanasi seat bhaajapa kii jholii main ai jab dow
 Murali Manohar Joshi had defeated Bahubali leader Mukhtar Ansari on the bsp's chariot

 He defeated AAP leader and current Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal by 371784 votes
 bhaajapa ne jagaai pichhadon kii asaloksabhaa chunaavon ke vakt jab sapa or basapa dalit vot saadhane main lage the bhaajapa ne pichhadon par najar gadai
 BJP gave tickets to 15 very backward candidates and reached Parliament
 akhilesh yadav ne haal hi main 17 pichhadi jatiyon (kahaar, kashyap, kevat, mallaah, nishad, kumhaar, prajapati, dhivar, dhimar, bind, bhar, rajbhar, batham, turaha, gond, maanjhi or machuaaraa) ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kaa prastaav apni cabinet main paas kar chuke hai
 If these 17 castes are seen by voters in UP, then they will be around 5 percent
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main in jatiyon ne bijepi ke paksh main vot diya tha
 Samajwadi Party wants to get votes of these castes so that it will benefit in assembly elections
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki 2014 amit shah kii ranneeti or modi kaa jaadu 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main najar aata he yaa nahin
 What will happen after demonetisation Rukhvaranasi is known for its sarees and handicrafts

 bhartiya sena ne pioke main sargical strike karke pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya he
 Former Army Chief General Bikram Singh held talks on the surgical strike till date
 unhone kaha ki yah sahi time par behtareen sargical strike kiya gaya
 Know what else he said
 
 
 
 Question: Do you think that the surgical strike was the most accurate operation in this case? Answer: The Army had said that it will respond at the right place at the right time
 yah jaruri tha ki karwai tay kiye gaye thikaane par ho dekhie karwai aatankiyon par kii gai
 The terrorists who wanted to infiltrate
 laanch pad par baithe the
 This was a great operation
 sawaal:sargical strike kya hoti he?jawaab:jo target hota he usko lenaa hota he
 Do not allow co-lateral damage, do not allow damage
 sawaal:sargical strike koun se jawan karte hai?jawaab:hamaare paas special force he jo trend jawan he
 It is considered the world's best force
 jo waar karke, thik nuksaan karke waapas aate hai
 Question: What special technique is needed? Answer: Strong confidence like rock, physical fitness, confidence in mind leadership, trust in team is needed
 yah team work ke andar special force taiyaar kii jaati he
 There is a family
 ek duusare ke liye marane kaa jajba hota he
 Is brotherly and friendly
 isiilie hamaari bhartiya sena kii special force behad behtareen he
 The most important thing is that he will not leave his partner behind
 isliye kaarywai aisi hoti he agar vah raste se bhatak jaae, chot lag jaae to team usko waapas lekar hi aegi
 Question: How much planning is needed? Answer: Planning is needed
 sargical strikke liye jang e maidan main kabhi ham kisi objective par jate hai to kya root honge? kya rukaawate aaengi
 What will be prepared for him and from where can fire come upon us? or kya sambhaavnaaen hai
 How much is the reserve force
 agar koi aise halaat aa jaaenge to ri-inforcement kii jarurat pade to helicopter kaa istemaal kar sakate the
 So these plans are in every form

 It is prepared inside the formation

 We have technology
 We can also do recording
 sawaal:kya videography kar sakate hai?jawaab:sargical strikke dauraan aajkal chote camere aate hai jo helmet or kandho par feet ho jate hai
 This is required when you have to show that your action is correct
 vah dastur dikhaane ke liye ki aapaki dasturi karrwai thi isliye recording jaruri he
 Especially for this operation because wrong information was constantly coming from the other side
 usko nakaarne ke liye videography behad jaruri he
 Question: What is the difference, have there been surgical strikes before? Answer: Action has been taken
 aisi pehle bhi hui he
 Earlier, the military leadership used to take action under their supervision
 is baar aap dekhie political baking he
 Which is very important
 is baar jaise hi uri kaa hamalaa hua to pradhanmantri ne statement diya jisase army kaa hausala badha
 It has been happening before that the military has been taking action on its own
 antar yah he yah jo level he ek oparation chaar-paanch jagah karnaa or political baking yah behad mahatvapurn he
 This has greatly affected the morale of the army
 sawaal:pm kii bhoomika or enese kaa kya role he?jawaab:har cheez jo shuru hoti hepradhanmantrise shuru hoti he

 Under the scheme of your choice

 Prior to this, community leaders have taken out rallies in various districts for their demands
 pichley saal mumbai main maratha kranti morcha ne ek badi raily kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Maratha reservation became a sore throat for BJP
 
 
 maharashtra main maratha aarakshan andolan devendra fadanvis kii sarkaar ke gale kii fans ban gaya he
 The demand for Maratha reservation which has arisen in the state ahead of next year's Lok Sabha and Assembly elections has also created trouble for the BJP
 fadanvis sarkaar chaahakar bhi ise amalijama pahanaati he to obisi samudaay kii naaraazgi jahaan uthaani padegi, vahiin bijepi shasit duusare rajyon main bhi is tarah kii maang uth sakati he
 In view of this, the party is completely silent on this matter
 congress ne paas kiya tha vidhansabha main aarakshan bill
 
 
 Significantly, the previous Congress government in Maharashtra passed the bill relating to reservation to Marathas in the Vidhan Sabha, but it was stayed by the court
 court ne pichhada varg ayog se maratha samaaj kii aarthik or saamaajik sthiti par report maangi thi
 Last year too, the Maratha community took to the road for agitation demanding reservation
 iske baad mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne sidhe taur par aarakshan kii maang ko to nahin mana, lekin us disha main aage badhane ko lekar ahm kadam uthaane kii baat kahi thi

 nehru-gandhi parivaar kii ye paanchavin peedi he jo congress adhyaksh kaa pad sanbhaalegi
 Before him, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi from the nehru-gandhi family have held this top post of the party
 ab isko ‘nayaa siyaasi avatar’ kahiye yaa ‘bhole baba kii bhakthi kaa chamatkaar’ lekin nehru-gandhi parivaar kii paanchavin peedi yani rahul gandhi ‘bam bam bole’ ke aahvaan ke saath hi congress adhyaksh pad ke liye 4 disambar, somvaar ko namakan daakhil karenge
 On December 11, the last day of withdrawal of nomination will be formally announced to elect Rahul Gandhi as President if there is no other party's nomination for the post

 Rahul Gandhi has often been seen visiting temples since his visit to Kedarnath two and a half years ago
 gujarat ke is chunaav prachaar main rahul jis kshetra main bhi gaye, vahaan sthit har bade mandir main darshan karne jarur gaye
 In the same episode on Wednesday, he reached the historic Somnath temple to pay obeisance

 However, some commentators also link this new political avatar of Rahul to the AK Antony Committee report in which the pro-muslim image of the party was blamed to some extent for the Congress's rise in electoral politics
 is bahes kii phikr kiye bina rahul apane tay kiye raste par badhate ja rahe hai
 In the party's review meeting after the defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Rahul had asserted himself to be a Brahmin
 kuch hafte pehle rahul ne kaha tha ki in dinon ve gita pard rahe hai
 Just two weeks ago, after offering prayers at the Veer Meghamaya temple in Patan, Gujarat, Rahul said, 'I am a devotee of Shiva, believe in truth, whatever BJP says, i believe in my truth
 ’ rahul ne aasthaa or mandiron main darshan ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main ye baat kahi thi

 In such a situation, the dates of December 3 and 4 were filed before Rahul
 kai karibiyon kii salaah thi ki rahul 3 disambar ko hi namakan daakhil kar de, aakhri taarikh kaa intjaar naa karen
 The reasoning of these advisers was that due to Sunday holiday on December 3, there will be plenty of coverage on the media
 lekin rahul ne khud tay kiya ki ve 4 disambar, yani aakhri taarikh ko hi namakan daakhil karenge
 Actually, December 4 is Monday, which is considered to be a special day of worship of Rahul's beloved Lord Shiva
 4 disambar ko rahul sabase pehle bhole baba kaa aashirwad lenge, phir rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ko naman karenge
 After that, they will go to the Congress headquarters and file nomination

 Without Steve Smith and David Warner, the Australian team does not look as strong, giving India a golden opportunity to win the first Test series in Australia
 jones ne ‘sidney marning herald’ se kaha, ‘bharat agar yah siries nahin jeet sakaa to australia main kabhi nahin jeet paaegaa
 India are miles ahead of Australia in every format, but is they confident and will their fast bowlers be able to live up to the expectations
 ’jones ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki bharat 2-0 yaa 3-0 se jitegaa, kyonki mujhe nahin lagata ki australia ek bhi test jeet sakegaa
 "india has to win the series, so openers will have to play big innings", Jons said, "it is very difficult to defeat Australia on its soil
" lekin, is team main steve smith or david warner nahin hai, jo australia ke ranon kaa 40 pratishat banaate hai
 Who will replace him? ’gend se chhedhkhani vivaad ke baad australia kaa maidan par bartaav surkhiyon main he

 lekin, jones ne kaha ki kohli se chhintakashi se team ko bachanaa chahie

 Ponting's mind game about Kohli, told this kangaroo player
 When asked about ways to curb Kohli, Jones said, "finding Kohli's lack of batting is the same as finding a shortfall in Monalisa
" uske cover drive par roak lagaani hogi

 According to sources, amid the rapidly changing developments of the BJP, during a meeting of senior party leaders on Tuesday evening, it was decided to replace Gadkari as someone else

 sutron ne bataaya ki gadakari buudhvaar ko party ke sheersh pad ke liye 62 varshiya rajnath ke naam kaa prastaav rakh sakate hai
 Rajnath has been the president of the party before and he is considered close to the Sangh like Gadkari
 gadakari ne apane bayaan main yah daawa bhi kiya ki unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he
 He said, 'nevertheless, the UPA government has been trying to propagate vicious propaganda about me to harm me and my party

 But after the Income Tax Department raided several locations associated with the BJP president's company Purti Group, the party decided that it would not be right for Gadkari to continue in the post in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 naye ghatnakram ke bich sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, rajnath singh or anant kumaar aadi varisht netaaon ne halaat kaa jayja liya or yah paaya ki gadakari kii jagah kisi or kaa adhyaksh bananaa zyada thik hoga

 purti maamle ke ujagar hone ke baad gadakari kii daavedaari kaa kuch dinon se virodh kar rahe varisht netaa yashavanth sinha ne mangalvaar shaam ko party se namakan patr or matadaata suchi lekar yah sanket diya tha ki vah gadakari ko nirvirodh nahin chune jane denge
 But after Gadkari's resignation, he too declared himself out of the race
 gauratlab he ki gadakari rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke bahut kareebi hai or usee ke kaaran unhen party kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 The second term was also given to him due to the pressure of the Union
 magar mangalvaar subah se badalte ghatnakram ke bich sangh bhi gadakari ke naam se peeche hat gaya or bich kaa rasta nikaale jane par sahamat ho gaya
 Senior party leader LK Advani was also against giving a second term to Gadkari when the Purti issue came to light and he was advocating for Sushma Swaraj or someone else to be replaced in his place
 aath logon ke haath main aarthik survey he
 In between, the hashtag is the new target of $ 5 trillion, ie 5 thar economy, which is to be achieved in the next five years
 jidipi ko 7 pratishat tak pahunchaana he
 10 shells are made on the cover of this hash tag economic survey
 inamen se aath gole main alag alag target likhe hai
 Jobs, investment, exports, savings, data and law are moreover Nudg
 dictionari main dekhenge to naj kaa matlab dhakelnaa hoga lekin ichonmi main ek theory naj ichonmiks kehalaati he
 It is propounded by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics and American economist Richard Theler
 naj iconomi main logon ke vittiya vyavhaar ko bina jor jabardastee ke nirdeshit kiya jaataa he
 That is, the government will change your habits in how you will do economic activities
 richard theller kii kitaab Nudge kai uniwarsity main padhi jaati he or padhai jaati he
 In 2010, a team was formed in the office of the British Prime Minister with the aim of successfully implementing government policies with the help of Nudge Theory and promoting the schemes at a low cost
 bharat main bhi niti ayog is line par sochataa rahaa he
 Did this theory spread publicity at low cost? duniya main tezi se shaharikaran ho rahaa he
 The forest of houses grows around us
 agle chalis saal main duniya kii aadhi se adhik aabaadi shahari ilaake main rahane lagegi
 For this every month, a metropolitan city of New York will be built on earth
 building sector se badi maatra main green house gas nikalati he jisase jalwaayu par lagaataar bura asar pad rahaa he
 But cement and steel consumption in this sector makes GDP figures colorful
 to ek taraf green house gas kaa khatara he to duusari taraf jidipi kaa sapana he
 For the past several years, no new model has been revealed about the economy
 kitaab ek hi he
 Just its cover changes every year with a new version
 ab dekhie nadiyon yaa pani ke sansaadhan jin paanch das logon kii nitiyon or santhganth ke kaaran barbaad hue agar vahi badal jaaen to aapako puure desh se apil karne kii zarurat hi nahin hogi ki sabko milakar pani kaa sankat dur karnaa hoga
 It must be said that everyone will have to do something together, but before that they should also question whether they all have created this water crisis together
 kya acha nahin hota ki jin logon kii nitiyon ke kaaran abhi bhi jalsankat ke kaaran paidaa ho rahe hai vahi badal jaaen
 That is to say, we are not thinking anything new about the economic crisis and the economic potential
 ek hi tarah ke vichaaron ko alag alag tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa rahata he
 GDP has been mentioned
 aarthik survey aa gaya he
 Economic survey is in the hands of eight people
 jiske bich main hashtag 5 trillian dollar yani 5 kharab kii arthvyavastha kaa nayaa target he jo agle paanch saal main hasil karnaa he
 GDP to reach 7 percent
 hesh tag vaale is aarthik survey ke cover par 10 gole bane hai
 Eight of these circles have different targets written
 naukari, nivesh, niryaat, bachat, data or kanoon iske alaava ek he naj (nudge)
 If you look in the dictionary, the meaning of nudge would be to push, but in economy a theory is called nudge economics
 ise 2017 ke arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar vijeta or america arthshaastri richard theller ne pratipaadit kiya he
 In Naja Economy, the financial behavior of the people is directed without coercion
 yani sarkaar ek tarah se aapaki aadaton ko badalegi ki aap aarthik kriyalap kaise karenge
 Richard Thaler's book Nudge is read and studied at many universities
 2010 main britain ke pradhanmantri ke daftar main ek team banaai gai thi jiskaa uddeshy naj theory kii madad se sarkari nitiyon ko safalataa se lagu karnaa he or kam kharche main yojanaon kaa prachaar prasar karnaa he
 NITI Aayog has been thinking on this line in India too
 kya is theory ke anusaar kam kharche main prachaar prasar hua
 The then Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore had told in Lok Sabha that from 2014 to December 2018, Rs 5,245 crore was spent on publicity for government schemes
 upie sarkaar ne apane das saal ke kaarykaal main 5,040 karod kharch kiya tha
 Then what was the benefit of Nudge Theory
 isamen prachaar prasar ko lekar tark he ki logon kaa vyavhaar badalegaa to rajyavardhan rathore ne tab bataaya tha ki hamane aankalan nahin kiya he ki in vigyapanon kaa kya prabhaav padaa
 One thing i want to do about the cover of the economic survey
 pichhali baar yani 2018-19 ke aarthik survey ke cover kaa rang gulabi tha
 The entire website had turned pink
 tab har pramukh baaten gulabi rang ke gole main bataai gai thim
 It was argued that the survey color has been pink to show support for the women's movement across the country
 gulabi karne kaa kaaran yah bataaya gaya tha ki duniya bhar main mahilaon ke khilaaf ho rahi hinsa kaa ant karne ke liye jo andolan ho rahe hai uskaa samarthan jataane ke liye aarthik survey kaa rang gulabi kar diya gaya he
 What has affected the movement of women and their condition from the color pink, it should have been in the survey report at least this time
 aarthik survey banane vaali team ne aasaani se is baar kaa cover gulabi se nila kar diya he
 Blue Sky Thinking has given a new slogan
 survey ke hindi ank main likhaa he ki nile gagan ke samaan vistrut vichaardhaara se aarthik samiksha prerit he
 But what are the consequences of this change of colors, it has not been told to anchors doing more research like us
 kam se kam sarkaar bataati ki matternity live act jo bana tha, uske kya nattejey nikle
 An analysis of Rituparna Chakravati was featured in Live Mint in December 2018
 ve bataa rahi hai ki matternity live act banane kaa koi khaas asar nahin padaa
 On the contrary, companies started giving less jobs to women so that they do not have to be discharged while pregnant
 bajet pesh hone ke baad aarthik survey kii charchaa peeche rah jaaegi lekin is survey ke chapter 2 main survey or sarkaar kii yojanaon ke peeche chhipe manovaigyanik aadhaar ke bare main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 No government openly tells how it is changing your behavior so that your habits fit into its plans
 is manovaigyanik aadhaar ko samajhane se aap sarkaar kii kai yojanaon kaa makasad samaj paaenge
 Therefore, we want to focus a little bit on Nudge Theory
 hindi ke akhbaar yaa channel shaayad hi isaki baat karen lekin sanyog se hamaari sahyogi bani bedi ne richard theller kii kitaab Nudge padhi he to laga ki aapse iske bare main saajha karte hai
 Owners of this theory, Richard Theler and Cass Santin, have written a book called Nudge: improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness
 cas sanstin raashtrapati obama ke soochna salaahkaar the
 Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron created a nudge unit in his office, whose mentor was Richard Theler
 is kitaab kaa cover dilachasp he
 Hathini is pushing her children lightly on the path
 is kitaab main donon lekhak samajha rahe hai ki hamaare andolan kaa naam liberterian petrnalism he
 Under patternalism you understand that as parents are telling the child what to do and what not to do
 jo log angrezi bhashaa ke muhaavaron kaa istamaal karte hai wo petrnalism kaa matlab ek duusare arth main karte hai
 Just like you interfere a lot in their life, keep on interfering with their decisions in such a way that they or parents know more than you
 to jawaab miltaa he ki aisa karne waalon kaa nazariyaa bahut hi petrnlistic he yaa petrnising he
 Both these authors say that nudges can be done for a good cause
 richard or sanstin ne ise andolan kaa rup diya he
 He says that people will have freedom but their behavior can be affected in a slight way for their betterment
 kyonki kai baar log apana faisla galat karte hai
 Chapter number 2 of the Economic Survey reads how it was successfully used in the Swachh Bharat Mission and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao
 is aarthik niti ko thik se samajhane kii zarurat he
 In both economic behavior and political behavior
 arthshaastra kii shakha he vyaavhaarik arthshaastra
 That is, people do not always make logical decisions
 is siddhant ko sanskrit ke ek shloke se samajhaayaa gaya he
 Tarko Pratishtha: Shrutyovibhinnanayako Rishiryasya: Matam Siddham
 matlab yah hua ki keval tarkpurna chintan ko hi param satya nahin mana ja saktaa he kyonki yah bhi purvaagrah se mukt nahin he
 So can the government's move be free of prejudices? According to this verse, what is the truth of the government, by which logic has become the ultimate truth
 aakhir logon ko hi samajhnaa hoga ki jo sarkaar kar rahi he vah sahi he yaa nahin
 The Vedas are analyzed in Nirukta
 ek rishi hue hai, yask
 In response to who is called Acharya, Yask says that Acharam grahayati, acharati, achinoti arthan, achinoti intelligence
 matlab acharya vah hota he jo khud aacharan karata he, aacharan grahan karaata he, achche shabdon kaa chayan karata he or buddhi kaa chayan karata he
 Meaning that you are going to preach to others what your behavior is but how is your own behavior
 kya sarkaar ke vyavhaar ko badalane kii zarurat nahin he, uske liye richard theller or sanstin bhaaiyon ne kya maarg bataaya he
 i just want to understand deeply as a general audience and reader of Hindi
 kya aam janata jaanati he ki sarkaar ek yojana kii safalataa ke liye uskaa vyavhaar kyon badal rahi he, kahin iske zarie ek robotic samaaj kii rachana to nahin ho rahi he, jahaan har kisi ko kadamtal kaa prashikshan diya ja rahaa he
 Why is there so much emphasis on changing people's psychological and practical habits in a gentle way
 sarkaar ise aarthik kshetra main apana rahi he main iske asar ko raajnneetik kshetra main dekhnaa chahta hum
 Chapter two of the survey further states that behavioral economics can provide a valuable tool of change in the way social and religious beliefs play a major role in influencing behavior in India
 aise mitra, padosi, role model, jinhen log pahachaanate hon, unke sahyog se saamaajik maanakon ko protsaahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Initially many people became brand ambassadors on Twitter regarding cleanliness
 unhone kahin jhaadu lagaaya, photo twit kiya or gaayab ho gaye
 Not seen again
 aisa jhansa dene ke liye bhi ho saktaa he ki kisi actor ko le aao
 Now people will give moral education, people will be affected, then it will disappear, then another actor will come and he will give moral education on another subject
 prerana ke naam par
 How is society being made with this inspiration
 kya sarkaar yah tark de rahi he ki vah ek tarah se aapako dhaal rahi he ki aap kya pasand karen, kya nahin pasand karen
 Although the government is giving examples of these in the success of its schemes, it may not be too bad
 bani bedi ne bataaya ki britain, australia or bharat main bhi is raste se kuch yojanaon main laabh hota he lekin isse sarkaar ke paas aisi shaktiyaan aa jaati hai jiske nattejey khataranaak bhi ho sakate hai
 The government has stated the psychological basis of implementing its policies
 vah bataa rahi he ki kaise prachaar prasar ke maanakon ke zarie prerit kiya ja rahaa he, logon ke vyavhaar ko badla ja rahaa he
 No government has ever said this
 hindi pradeshon main is par baat honi chahie
 Is the government changing your other decisions on the pretext of this or is it building its base
 kya hoga agar sarkaar aapaki pasand tay karne lage jise angrezi main manipulate kehete hai tab uske aarthik or raajnneetik parinaam kya honge
 Is the use of this technic also changing the behavior of political decisions? naj theory vaale chapter main bataaya gaya he ki kaise sandesh pahunchane ke liye namaami gange yaa ayushmaan jaisi yojanaon kaa massej logon tak pahunchaaya gaya
 But did the Ganges clear, the structure of government health services improved
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki isse vyavhaar badalata he yaa phir logon ke dimag main sarkaar ko lekar koi baat baith jaati he
 Bani Bedi tried to find criticism or other side of it on the internet
 cambries yaniversity press kaa ek pramukh jarnal he
 European Journal of Risk Regulation
 isamen naj theory kii santulit aalochana lagi
 Nudge works only when you manipulate people's preferences
 iske zarie logon ke aam swabhaav kii jagah automatic vyavhaar gadha ja rahaa he
 What you call the default setting on the computer's tongue
 vyavhaar badalane kaa adhikaar sarkaar ko de rahe hai lekin is automatic vyavhaar kii javabdehi koun legaa
 To what extent can a government go about changing behavior
 iske bachaav main theller or sanstin hi maanate hai ki najing menipulation he
 But the argument of both is always manipulation of choice or decision in a democracy
 ham logon ko Nudge kar rahe hai magar logon ke paas vikalp he
 You are free phir donon kehete hai ki ham ise prachaar prasar se hi jodakar aazmaaenge
 So, the whole objective is to spread the publicity, perhaps because in this survey new slogans were replaced instead of old ones
 jandhan kaa hi udhaaharan lijie
 Its benefits were also told, but Sapna was also sold or people came in a lurch that 15 lakhs would come into the account
 iskaa raajnneetik parinaam kiske paksh main gaya
 For example, according to the Nudge theory, it is claimed that you are free not to invest in the government's new pension scheme
 lekin sarkaar ne to apni pension skim khatm kar di he
 Then what option do you have left
 bazaar kaa hi to vikalp he
 i am not knowledgeable about economic matters, but if anything in this economic survey is worth debating, it is worth understanding, then it is a nudge theory
 gardian ne likhaa he ki 2008 main mandi ai tab usee ke saath yah theory popular hui
 The Guardian newspaper wrote on 1 June 2014 that Nudge Economics, which previously seemed a solution, now looks like a plaster
 jaise lipa potee kar di gai ho
 This year the Nudge unit was removed from cabin control
 lagata he ki pradhanmantri camran ab ise utana mahatv nahin dete hai
 In 2010, the Nudge unit was created in the UK cabinet
 jab camraen ne yah unit banaai thi tab kaha tha ki rajaneta tabhi safal hoga jaisi janata he, vaisaa bartaav kare
 If we combine this idea with the behavioral economy, then society will benefit
 camran ab pradhanmantri nahin hai
 Cameron told this in a TED talk in California
 janata jaisi he bartaav vaisaa hi ho uske saath kaa matlab to yah bhi hua ki agar uske bheetar kisi samudaay ke prati nafrat he to phir us nafrat ko har level par ubhaaro or raajnneetik laabh lo
 This is my question
 aaj kal aap sunate honge ki bharat kii ichonmi 5 trillian dollar kii ho jaaegi
 In the meeting of NITI Aayog, Prime Minister Modi had asked to set the target of economy of 5 trillion dollars
 aarthik survey main kaha gaya he ki 2024-25 tak 5 trillian dollar kii ichonmi ke liye zaruri he ki jidipi ko lagaataar 8 pratishat hona hoga
 America's Economy Size 19
 39 trilayan dollars he
 12 of China
 24 trilayan dollar he
 These are the only two countries whose economy size is more than $ 5 trillion
 aarthik survey main likhaa he ki 2014-15 main bharat ne 2
 It was estimated to reach $ 1 trillion
 2015-16 main bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 1
 99 trillion dollars
 2018-19 me bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 2
 75 trillion dollars
 2014 se 2019 tak bharat kii arthvyastha ke aakaar main jo vruddhi hui he vah 1 trillian dollar se bhi kam rahaa he
 The size of China's economy was $ 10 trillion in 2014 to $ 12 trillion in 2019
 china jaisaa desh paanch saal main do trillian dollar jod paata he, bharat ek trillian dollar se bhi kam
 So what is India going to do this time that will be doubled in the next five years, even from the first term of the Modi government
 1 trillian bhi nahin judaa to ab kaise paanch saal main 2
 2 trillion dollars will be added
 sapana bada to he, sapana pichley baar bhi bada hi tha, us sapane kaa kya hua, is sapane kaa kya hoga
 All figures have been taken from the site of the Economic Survey, International Monetary Fund, World Bank
 thodaa bahut antar rahane kii gunzaaish he
 Appal was looking at 2019 data on the International Muda Fund site
 iske anusaar puri duniya kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 87
 27 trillion dollars
 28 desh hai jinaki arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 1 trillian dollar se zyaada he
 Looked at the International Muda Fund site where the GDP size data for 2019 is
 uske anusaar aakaar ke maamle main bharat kaa sthaan duniya main paanchavaa he
 India overtook France in 2018
 phir britain ko bhi peeche chhod gaya he
 However, Japan ranks third after the USA and China, 5
 18 trillian dollar he
 Germany ranks fourth, 3rd
 96 trillian dollar he
 India ranks fifth, 2nd
 97 trillian dollar he
 Britain ranks sixth, 2nd
 83 trillian dollar he
 France ranks seventh, 2nd
 76 trillian dollar he
 The Economic Survey of India states that the size of the economy is 2 in 2018-19
 75 trillian dollar he
 The imf's latest data is slightly higher
 sarkaar bhi imef ke data ko kot karti he
 As Finance Minister in Bhopal in May 2015, Arun Jaitley had said that India can achieve double-digit GDP but in the next year 2016 India Today conclave, Jaitley said that it is difficult to achieve double-digit GDP in the current situation
 is
 2018-19 yani pichley aarthik survey main jidipi kaa anumaan tha 7 se 7
 The rate of GDP will be 5 percent but 6
 8 pratishat hi jidipi rahi
 The Economic Survey notes that India ranks seventh in terms of GDP
 is vakt pichley daur ke naare sunai nahin de rahe hai
 Slogans like Make in India and Skill India have now gone on the trail
 nae naare aa gaye hai
 The government has either abandoned or replaced the old slogans or created new slogans
 beti bachaao beti padhaao kii jagah beti aapaki dhan lakshmi or vijay lakshmi yani badlaav kaa naaraa aayaa he
 Beautiful India has come in place of Clean India
 alpiji kii sabsidi chode kii jagah sabsidi ke bare main vichaar karo

 Looking at the news that is appearing in business newspapers, it seems that the challenges are becoming serious

 Rajpal Yadav is going to work with his friend after a long time with Nawazuddin Siddiqui's film Bole Bangi
 navaj or raajapaal kii dosti kai saal puraani he or donon ne sabase pehle film shul main kaam kiya tha
 The film starred Manoj Bajpayee and Raveena Tandon in the lead roles
 aaj se kareeb 20 saal pehle navazuddin siddiki or raajapaal yadav ne saath kaam kiya tha
 Although both were not able to make a mark in their industry at that time
 yun bhi navazuddin ke star hone ke saath hi unke sangharsh se sabhi waakif hai, magar is film ke saath hi navaj or raajapaal ne apane tallent ko dikhaa diya tha
 This was the period when Anurag Kashyap suggested Rajpal Yadav's name for the film Shool
 unhone is film main ek kuli kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 Rajpal was the new NSD pass-out at the time and did his small role in an excellent manner with Manoj Bajpayee and Raveena Tandon
 vahiin is film main kuch hi der baad jab manoj apni patni ravina ke saath restaurant pahunchate hai to waiter ke taur par navazuddin siddiki najar aate hai
 At that time, Anurag had also said that you are a good actor and why are you doing this small role? On this Nawazuddin had said that with the help of this role, he would get 1500 rupees, which would give him money to pay the rent
 tab anuraag ne kaha tha ki agar mujhe apane dam par actors lene kii aazaadee mili to main tumhen jarur cast karuunga
 Today everyone is familiar with the pair of Anurag Kashyap and Nawazuddin

 On 16 January, an ATM cash van was robbed in Mumbai without injuring and firing anyone
 lutere bhi usee andaaj main bina kisi muthbhed yaa zyada mashkkat ke aasaani se daboch liye gaye
 They were traveling in a bus instead of a car or train to throw dust in the eyes of the police, but still could not escape the police's grip
 patiala police sutron ke mutabik, city raajpura police kii had main 23 janvari ko jab vah neshnal haive number ek par sabhi gadiyon kii talaashi le rahe the, tabhi chaaron hathiyaar or rupee ke saath pakade gaye
 At first, they tried to trick the police by lying, but when the police tightened up, they confessed to robbing the ATM cash van in Mumbai
 atm cash vine kaa suraksha guard sadare alam bhi unke saath tha
 All four were looking to go to Jammu, because apart from Sadre Alam, the other three robbers Khurshid, Mukhtar and Manzoor are residents of Jammu
 gauratlab he ki mumbai main rupayon se bhari atm vine loar parel se kaashi mira ke liye nikali thi, lekin raste main vine main hi tainaat guard sadare alam ne chaay main behoshee kii dawaai milakar pilaa di thi
 As the guards arrived at the Milan subway in Santa Cruz, another guard and the ATM cash loader fainted and the driver also began to faint, then a car appeared on the highway near the Milan subway
 vine rukate hi usame se teen yuvak utre or sadare alam kii madad se atm vine main ghus kar pehle dryver ko peeta phir ek karod 95 lakh rupee lekar faraar ho gaye the
 On receiving the information, both the driver and the remaining unconscious personnel were admitted to the hospital and search for the robbers started
 bina bandook chale yaa kisi ko jakhmi kiye karodon kii lut hairaan karne vaali thi or aspataal main dryver ko dekhte hi police ko us par shaq ho gaya
 An officer from Mumbai Crime Branch, who is part of the investigation team, identified him
 pataa chalaa ki uskaa naam tarik he or goregaanv police stesan main uske khilaaf pehle se aparaadhik maamla darj he
 What was it then Tariq had to tell everything the truth
 police ne tarik ke ghar se pehle uske hisse kii 34 lakh kii rakam baraamad kii
 Then caught a watchman named Kaka
 pusil ke mutabik, kaaka lut ke mastermind khurshid ke sampark main tha or vaardaat ke din vah ek taxi ke jariye atm vine kaa peechha kar luteron ko atm vine kii lokation bataa rahaa tha
 From Kaka, the police came to know that Sadre Alam, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, is not going to his village and is going to Jammu with the other three looters and he is deliberately traveling from Mumbai to Jammu by bus, so that the police's eye i could throw dust agle maah oktober main bhartiya ucch shiksha ayog ke gathan kaa prastaav vichaar ke liye cabinet ke saamne pesh kiya jayega
 a provision has been made to bring UGC (vishwa Vidyalaya Grant Commission) and AICTE (all India Council for Technical Education) within the purview of this commission
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke adhikariyon ne buudhvaar ko is bare main jaankaree di he
 Let us know that the Ministry of Human Resource Development announced its decision to change the University Grants Commission (UGC) by repealing the UGC Act, 1951 last year
 masauda vidheyak ko saarvajanik kshetra main daal diya gaya tha or hitdharakon se pratikriya or suzav maange gaye the

 At present, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) has made it public for the suggestions of the people
 is par vibhinn pakshakaron se raay bhi maangi gai he
 It is being said that the objective of Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is to improve the quality of higher education and the level of education
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye 17 tiimon kaa gathan kiya he
 This means that all major party leaders and office-bearers have been entrusted with the responsibility to formulate and execute the electoral strategy
 amit shah ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab chunavi ranneeti vyakti kendrit karne kii jagah sanghathan kendrit kiya gaya he
 It is worth noting that till now, Amit Shah himself was carrying out the entire task of running the elections for all the states
 chunaav dar chunaav bhaajapa ko jeet milti gai or sanghathan main vyakti kendrit chunaav sanchaalan yaa sanghathan sanchaalan ko maun sweekruti milti gai
 But after the dismal performance of the BJP in the elections of five states last December, voices started to rise against the person centered tradition within the party
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is dabaav kii vajah se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko vyakti kendrit karne kii jagah sanghathan kendrit karne kii majaburi bhaajapa aalaa netritv ke saamne pesh hui
 On Sunday, the BJP formed 17 teams for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, involving around 100 people
 vijan dacument cameti, prachaar-prasar cameti or content cameti ke jariye varisht netaaon rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, nitin gadakari, nirmala sitaraman, shivaraj singh chouhan jaise netaaon ko tarjeeh mili
 Till now, there was only a hint among the supporters of these leaders that they have been kept out of the activities of the party
 lekin team gathit hone ke baad in charchaaon ko viraam lagegaa
 It is believed that there was a message from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to the BJP president that the senior leaders of the party should be actively involved in the deliberations
 ab 17 team banane ke baad itnaa tay mana ja rahaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak bhaajapa apni sanghathan kii takat kaa bharpoor istemaal karegi or chunaav vyakti kendrit hone kii jagah vikendrikrut hokar sanghathan kendrit honge
 The organization will have collective responsibility for the election results

 The latest case has come to light the sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, the killer of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh
 congress ke netaa beant singh 1992 se 1995 tak punjab ke mukhyamantri rahe
 During his tenure, significant work was done towards ending Sikh terrorism in Punjab
 sikh aatankiyon ne hi 31 agast 1995 ko bam visphot se unki hatya kar di thi
 Human bombs were used in the murder
 maanav bam kaa naam tha dilawar singh or uske naakaam rahane par ye kaam jise karnaa tha wo shaks tha balavant singh rajoana
 Human bombs exploded and about one and a half dozen people, including Beant Singh, lost their lives
 dilawar bhi maaraa gaya lekin rajoana samet kai aatankiyon kii giraftaar hui
 Rajoana was tried under TADA law
 rajoana ne apane bachaav main koi vakil nahin liya or na hi nichali adaalat se faansee kii sajaa ke khilaaf koi apil kii
 Despite this, he was not hanged
 rajoana sikh kattarpathiyon kaa adarsh ban chukaa he
 Akal Takht has been declared a martyr alive
 2012 main uski faansee kii taarikh tay ho gai lekin centre kii manmohan singh ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ne is par roak laga di
 Not only this, the Punjab government led by akali-bjp's Prakash Singh Badal appealed against the court's decision in a higher court
 rajoana ko faansee nahin hui
 Badal also kept saying that the government was not in favor of hanging Rajoana
 punjab ke maujuuda mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh bhi baat ghumaakar kah rahe hai ki ve 2012 main hi kah chuke the ki ve faansee kii sajaa ke khilaaf hai
 After this, in September 2019, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government reduced Rajoana's death sentence to life imprisonment
 rajoana kii is kahani se ye to tay ho gaya he ki kattarpanth ke masale par bhaajapa, congress or akali ek hi dharaatal par khadey hue hai
 The rest of the party should not consider themselves different, they will also be seen with them if the opportunity comes
 punjab kii aabaadi main sikhon kii hissedari aadhi se kaaphi zyada he
 Political parties are thinking that if they behave softly on fundamentalists, then Sikhs will become dear to the country, including Punjab
 bhaajapa or endie kii kattarpathiyon par narmi kii vajah samaj main aati he ki ye swabhaav se hi dharm kii raajnneeti karti aa rahi hai
 But the Congress, which has raised the flag of secularism, is constantly being soft on the person convicted in the murder of the chief minister of his own party, which proves that she is only doing politics of votes
 rajoana kii jagah agar koi muslim aatankwaadi hota to bhi congress or bhaajapa ek hi dharaatal par khadey najar aate
 For them, the martyrdom of the martyr is not even legally worth fighting for and who is fighting against terrorism
 tada jaise mukademe main sajaa kam karne kaa ye virala udhaaharan he
 Millions of people of Punjab have suffered the tragedy of terrorism
 na jane kitne bekasoor log aatankiyon kaa nishaanaa bane hai
 In the recent years in the country, hanging is given very selectively anyway and timing is also taken care of
 2017 ke aankade bataate hai ki desh main 371 kaidi aise hai jinhen maut kii sajaa sunai gai he
 But not all prisoners are of political importance
 kaidiyon kaa aparaadh or dharm unka raajnneetik mahatv tay karata he or isi ke aadhaar par unhen maafee yaa sajaa main kami kaa laabh sarkaar kii taraf se miltaa he
 The Rajoana case has once again witnessed a sample of minority appeasement
 raajnneetik partiyaan alpsankhyak kattarta kaa samarthan yaa virodh apni suvidhanusaar kaise kar sakati hai, khaskar jab ye kanoon kaa maamla ho
 The Congress has seen that even after hanging three terrorists, there is no guarantee of continuing the government

 Goyal claimed that Kejriwal's party would be at number three in the MCD election

 He had said that he will force the government to take appropriate action on important subjects
 is baithak main vidhayak om prakaash sharma or jagadish pradhan bhi maujuud rahe
 Vijender Gupta said that it was decided in the Legislature Party meeting that the opposition's demand for withdrawal of Bharat Ratna from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi would be unconstitutionally removed from the resolution passed in the House

 a legislator of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had moved a resolution demanding withdrawal of 'bharat Ratna', the country's highest civilian honor given to Rajiv Gandhi
 sirsa ne guuruuvaar ko sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi is 'haalia prastaav main' kathith 'badlaav' ko lekar 'adhyaksh ram nivas goyal ko hataane' ke liye notice pesh kiya tha
 To which Goyal said that they cannot accept it because such a notice should be given 14 days in advance

 The speaker suspended Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta, Sirsa and BJP MLA Jagdish Pradhan for the day
 iske baad spikar ne sadan ko 15 minute ke liye sthagit kar diya
 Vijender Gupta and Manjinder Singh Sirsa, while interacting with reporters outside the House, alleged that the content of the proposal was changed as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party wants to tie up with the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
