in sabake bich bijepi adhyaksh amit shah somvaar ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se mumbai main mulaakaat karenge
 It is believed that in this meeting an agreement can be reached between the Shiv Sena and the BJP
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main donon partiyaan milakar chunavi maidan main ek baar phir utarane kii taiyaari main hai
 The Shiv Sena may attack Modi at the Center and the state's Phanavis government, but now both can contest the elections together
 sutron kii maane to maharashtra vidhansabha main aadhi-aadhi siton par chunaav ladane ke formule par sahmati ban gai he
 Apart from this, there has been talk about contesting BJP 25 and Shiv Sena 23 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki maharashtra main loksabhaa kii kul 48 siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP contested 26 seats, out of which 23 seats were won
 jabaki shivasena 22 siton par chunaav ladi thi or 18 siten jiti thi
 At the same time, BJP and Shiv Sena contested separate elections in the assembly elections, but later both formed a government together
 bijepi or shivasena ke bich lambii kasarat ke baad ab donon main sahmati dikh rahi he
 This is the reason why BJP President Amit Shah is reaching Mumbai on Monday evening to meet the Shiv Sena chief
 mana ja rahaa he ki rajya kii palghar loksabhaa seat ko bijepi chhodane ke liye taiyaar he
 In Lok Sabha as well as Assembly elections, the allocation of seats is considered almost fixed
 haalanki mukhyamantri pad ko lekar abhi pench fansaa hua he
 Shiv Sena wants to hold CM post
 vidhansabha chunaav main kisi kii bhi party kii siten zyada aaen, lekin mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hi hoga
 While the BJP has put a two-and-a-half-year formula in front of the Shiv Sena, but there is doubt about it
 bijepi netaa laal krishna adwani ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko pakistani piem navaj sharif se baatcheet ko lekar zyada utsuk nahin hona chahie
 Advani said that when Defense Minister AK Antony and Army Chief Bikram Singh have clearly stated that the Pakistan Army was involved in the killing of five jawans on the loc, the Prime Minister should not be too eager to talk to Nawaz Sharif
 adwani ne apane blog main is baat ke liye sena pramukh kii tarif kii ki sena ne apane press note main pehle jo baat kahi thi, baad main uski tasdik raksha mantri ne bhi kii
 The Defense Minister said in his statement, 'the Pakistani Army's Special Unit was involved in the attack
 'adwani ne likhaa, 'desh apeksha karata he ki mantri or sena kii ore se itane saaf shabdon main yah baat kahe jane ke baad pradhanmantri ko apane pakistani samakaksh ke saath shanti vaarta kii utsukata tyaag deni chahie

 co / nzqezxci4p kehete hai ki bollywood main dosti ho yaa dushmani kuch bhi permanent nahin he
 Everything changes with time and everyone takes out their work if needed, both from friend and also from enemy
 ab dekh lijie letest misaal
 We all know that Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan are big rivals of each other
 donon ke bich khub campitishan he, magar phir bhi shahrukh ke saath yaa unki film main apni film ko pramot karne se aamir ko koi aitraaj nahin
 Or just say that as soon as Aamir felt that if he combined his film with Shah Rukh's film, then his film would get a lot of publicity, similarly Aamir made his film 'PK' with Shah Rukh's Happy New Year
 Added the trailer
 ab 'happy new year' ke saath 'pike' kaa trailor chalaaya jayega, jo is diwali ke maukey par relies hui he
 For this, the makers of the film tied up with the multiplex owners specifically to run the trailer of 'PK' with 'happy New Year'
 aamir khan ne ek pramotional event par baat karte hue kaha ki shahrukh bade star hai
 'happy New Year' is a big film, which is releasing on the occasion of Diwali and their film gets a big opening
 aise main 'happy new year' ke saath 'pike' kaa trailor chalaane se meri film ko phayda hoga, kyonki zyada se zyada logon kii najar is par padegi
 Aamir also said that usually for the last few years, Shah Rukh brings the film on the occasion of Diwali and i am on the occasion of Christmas, so the promotion campaign of both of us comes in front of each other
 sirf aamir hi nahin
 Ajay Devgan is also promoting his film with Shah Rukh's film
 'happy new year' ke saath apni film 'ection jackson' kaa trailor jod diya he
 Although Shah Rukh and Ajay's relationship is not too special, Ajay too associated his film with Shah Rukh's film as soon as he got the chance
 'happy new year' ke saath ab 'ection jackson' kaa trailor bhi chalegaa
 When Ajay's film 'son of Sardar' was released with Shah Rukh's Jab Tak Hai Jaan on the occasion of Diwali 2 years ago, there was a conflict between the two films over screen share, although at that time Shah Rukh Had clearly said that he has no dispute with Ajay
 shahrukh kehete rahe the ki vah film ke sirf abhinayta hai, nirmaataa nahin, isliye yah vivaad yashraj binar ke saath he, jisane film 'jab tak he jaan' ko produs kiya tha, jo kisi had tak sahi bhi tha, lekin in sabake baavjood baar- baar kaha ja rahaa tha ki shahrukh or ajay aamane-saamne
 Ajay, the hero of the movie 'action Jackson', confessed and said that Shah Rukh's film gets a big opening, so if the trailer of his film is shown with 'happy New Year' then the action of 'action Jackson' will be a big benefit
 
 jo bhi ho
 We all know that neither Shahrukh and Aamir have a cordial relationship nor is there any friendship between Shahrukh and Ajay
 magar jaise hi jarurat padati he, ek-duusare ke saath aane se koi gurez nahin
 The Calcutta High Court on Friday wondered whether the central government does not think that the agitation in Darjeeling hills area for the demand of separate Gorkhaland needs to be pacified soon given the geopolitical situation in the area

 Elderly parents in Ahmedabad were severely traumatized when they arrived to pick up their monk's son and the son refused to return home
 darasal unka eklauta betadishanth patelpichley teen saal seahmadabadke bhadj ilaake sthitisconmandir main sadhu jivan ji rahaa he
 Dishant's father Rameshbhai Patel and his wife had a desire that their engineer son live a social life
 dishanth padhai main kaaphi hoshiyaar tha or usne gandhinagar ke dhirubhai ambani santhaan se beatech kiya tha, lekin degree lene ke tunrat baad usne apana ghar chhod diya or isckonmandirmen rahane chalaa gaya
 For the last three years, his parents have been repeatedly visiting the ISKCON temple for the son, but if he is allowed to meet, then for a few minutes in the presence of more people
 ramesh patel kaa aarope he ki isckon mandir ke logon ne unke bete kaa brinwash kiya he
 When Dishant's parents reached the ISKCON temple, the temple staff told them that Dishant went to the police station
 ab police ke saamne hi baat karegaa
 At the same time, the spokesperson of the ISKCON temple, Shyam Charan Prabhu says that thousands of people come to our temple
 kuch log zyada seva karnaa chaahate hai
 They are not small children to be brainwashed
 jab dishanth kii or uske parivaar waalon kii mulaakaat police kii maujuudagi main karai gai
 Here the father repeatedly kept pleading with the son to walk back home with folded hands
 vahiin uski maa kaa ab bhi ummid he ki uskaa betaa unke aansu dekhakar pigal jayega or unke saath ghar laut aayega
 Dishant says that he now wants to stay in the temple
 haalanki vah kai sawaalon kaa jawaab dene se bachataa rahaa
 According to Dishant, i want to serve in the temple itself
 main puure hoshohavaas main mandir main samarpit hua hu
 If a person wants to live the life of a monk, then he should be allowed to live
 ab dishanth ke pita rameshbhai kaa kahana he ki bete ko sirf apane moolbhoot adhikaar hi dikhaai de rahe hai, lekin use apane mata-pita ke prati ferj nahin dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, the police are also clear in this case that Dishant is adult
 kanuunan usapar kisi bhi tarah kaa dabaav nahin diya ja saktaa
 According to Police Inspector Rana, the parents wanted to take the sadhu, who has become a monk, to the house, but he says that he has taken the life of the monk
 saath hi usan apni marji se sadhu jivan sweekaar karne kii baat kahi he
 Family members have no legal way or hope left
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki agar koi apane parivaar kii marji ke khilaaf mandir jaakar sadhu banane kaa faisla karata he to isckon mandir ko unhen samajhaana chahie

 Obama told White House reporters, "I know that our soldiers will continue the difficult task of transferring rights to the Afghan government and making Afghanistan free from terrorist shelters
" ham in par jor denge or ham safal honge
 Obama said, "there is no one other than American forces who can make my words come true
" is saptahanth hamane 30 sainikon ko kho diya jab unka helicopter durghatnagrast ho gaya 
 He said that his death is reminiscent of the risks that our soldiers have to bear every day
 dushman or khataron ke bich har roj har raat ve is tarah ke abhiyaanon ko anjaam dete hai
 Like other campaigns, he was accompanied by Afghan soldiers in this campaign, in which seven died
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, ye stri purush un mulyon ke liye apni jaan daanv par lagaate hai jo hamen ek raashtra ke rup main baandhte hai
 They are from different places and their background and religion reflect America's wide diversity
 bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ko lagbhag madhyavargeey kranti main badalte hue or ek nai naitik raajnneeti kaa aahwan karte hue dilli main shandaar bahumat ke saath sarkaar banane vaale arvind kejariwal ne agar samay rahete apane kanoon mantri se istifa le liya hota to shaayad jitendra tomars kii giraftaari ke baad bhi kam se kam unki chhichhaledar nahin hoti
 But why could not Kejriwal show this moral strength in the case of one of his ministers, who has encouraged all ministers and leaders of other parties to openly accuse the big industrialists of the country? Is it because their priorities too are determined by who is standing in support of them and who is opposing them? yah sawaal poochne kii tabiyat isliye hoti he ki aam aadmi party ne kuch hi din pehle naitikta ke sawaal par ek tikhi andruni ladaai ladi
 Those who thought it necessary to keep the party clean and to shore up the suspects were not only sidelined, but also humiliated and replaced by all those suspicious people who left many questions in their old occupation Were surrounded by darasal pataa nahin kyon, shuddhtavaad kii tamaam pariyojnaon main ek vidambnaa si yah hoti he ki ve sari duniya par faisale sunaati hai, bas apane bheetar ke andheron ko dekh nahin paatin
 The arrogance of their right does not allow them to remain democratic
 ulte ek atirikt bhavukta unako dusron ke prati kuch krur hi bana daalati he
 The comments arvind kejariwal ke saath bhi yah vidambnaa ghatit hoti najar aati he
 It is a matter of regret that the benefit of this irony is being taken up by most of the central government which talks a lot about democratic plurality, but it is not visible in its ideology nor in its leaders
 varanaa degree ko lekar galat jaankaree dene kaa jo aarope jitendra tomars par he, vah centre sarkaar ke mantriyon par bhi he or unke maamle bhi adaalaton main hai
 But this is not a fight for moral norms, it is a fight to show each other their strength and there is no doubt that at the moment the central government is overshadowing the state government

 Truth is not on any side, there is power on both sides
 lekin duusare dalon ke tamaam mantriyon or netaaon par, desh ke bade udyogpatiyon par khuleam aarope lagane kaa hausala dikhaane vaale kejariwal apane ek mantri ke maamle main yah naitik bal kyon nahin dikhaa sake? kya isliye ki unki bhi praathamiktaayen is baat se tay hoti hai ki koun unke samarthan main khadaa he or koun unka virodh kar rahaa he? The health of asking this question is because the Aam Aadmi Party fought a fierce internal battle a few days ago on the question of morality
 jin logon ne yah zaruri samajha ki party ko paak-saafe rakhaa jaae or sandigdh logon ko kinare kiya jaae, unhen na sirf darkinar, balki apamaanit karke baahar kar diya gaya or unki jagah ve saare sandigdh log bache rahe jo apane puraane dhandhon main kai sawaalon se ghire hue the
 Actually, i do not know why, in all the projects of purism, there is an irony that they make decisions on the whole world, just cannot see the inner ones

 Unfortunately, this time people are also realizing that this is a battle of moral versus political, not political versus political in which there is a game of fake degrees on the one hand, on the other hand, to show their political power in the name of law

 On the other hand, BJP has also received some major setbacks recently
 sahyogi dal tidipi ne endie chhod diya he to shivasena aae din aankh dikhaata aankh dikhaata chalaa aa rahi he
 At the same time, after Rashtriya Lok Samata Party President Upendra Kushwaha and Lok Janshakti Party Ram Vilas Paswan, Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU) said after a meeting on Sunday that the election of Lok Sabha or Assembly in Bihar on the leadership and face of Nitish Kumar Must be fought bihar se bhi janata united ke kuch netaaon se abhi se 2019 chunaav ke maddenjar bayaan dena aarambh kar diya he
 BJP leaders believe that the statement of Janata Dal leaders is more than sending a message to the leaders and workers of Janata Dal United that they have not completely bowed down to Narendra Modi
 lekin ab saat june ko endie ke netaaon jisamen sabhi dalon ke vidhayak saansad shaamil honge us par sabaki nigahen hongi ki koun akhir kya bolta he
 Some leaders of Janata United from Bihar have also started making statements in view of the 2019 elections
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki janata dal ke netaaon kaa vaktavy bhaajapa se zyaada janata dal united ke netaa or kaaryakartaaon ko sandesh bhejne kii qavaayad he ki filhal wo narendra modi ke saamne puri tarah natmastak nahin hue hai
 But now on June 7, the leaders of the NDA, including the mlas of all the parties, will have their eyes fixed on who says what
 swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par laal kila se desh ko sambodhit karne hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki is swatantraaa diwas kaa jashn desh ke liye isliye bhi khaas he kyonki bharat vishwa kii 6veen sabase badi arthvyavastha ban chuki he
 PM said that today the entire world is focused on the Indian economy
 piem ne kaha ki vaishvik arthvyavastha ke jaankaron ne bhi daawa kiya he ki beete kuch varshon main bhartiya arthvyavastha uth khadi hui
 Due to this, India has been ready to run the global economy on its own for the next three decades
 pradhanmantri modi ne daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar puri duniya main bharat kii dhamak ko badhaane main safalataa pai he
 Modi credited this to the 125 crore dreams, resolutions and efforts of the country, who have set this record by walking in the right direction
 ise padhein: 3 lakh farji companiyaan band, 6 karod labhaarthi farji lekin kalaadhan par chuppipradhanmantri modi ne daawa kiya ki maujuuda samay main vaishvik arthvyavastha kii najar bharat par tiki he
 For big and small things, most big and small countries are looking towards India
 piem modi ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke pehle tak vaishvik manch par bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye daawa kiya jaataa tha ki isamen bade risk nihit hai
 But at present, the same global platform is believing that due to the economic reforms in India, there has been a fundamental change in the economy and due to this, the eyes of global investors are on India
 pradhanmantri ne daawa kiya ki jahaan unke kaarykaal se pehle bharat ke liye red tepe kaa zikr kiya jaataa tha vahiin ab unki sarkaar kii koshishon or aarthik sudhaar kii shuruyaat se bharat ko ej of duing bijness ke liye janaa ja rahaa he
 The PM said that while earlier Indian economy was kept in Frazile Five, now India is being seen as a destination for multi-billion dollar investment
 piem ne kaha ki aisa sirf riform, parform or transform kii unki niti ke chalate sambhav hua he
 Read this: PM told the pace of his work, but the truth is a bit different recently, the statement of International Monetary Fund that the elephant of Indian economy is now up and ready to run, but PM Modi said that it is very time for India It is special because with the help of these economic reforms, India is now ready for leadership in the global economy for two-three decades
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki jin vaishvik sanghathanon main sadsyta kii baat bharat soch bhi nahin saktaa tha vah aaj bharat ke netritv ko maan rahi hai
 PM said that India's role in the field of environment, global warming, human rights etc
 has become very important
 piem ne kaha ki iskaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aaj koi bhi bhartiya duniya ke kisi hawaii adde par passport dikhaata he to uskaa swaagat sammaan ke saath kiya jaataa he
 It is misused that often terrorists chose the 13th method to carry out attacks in India
 is baar bhi mumbai main silsilewar visphoton ke liye aatankwaadiyon ne isi din ko chunaa
 The biggest example of misuse of 13 marks occurred on 13 December 2001 in Delhi's very safe Parliament House complex when five gunmen entered the premises

 The German Bakery is located near the Chavd House of Jews and the Osho Ashram

 It is believed that the terrorists carried out a series of bomb blasts in Mumbai on Wednesday and chose the date of July 13 for this
 mumbai ke jhaveri bazaar, charani road sthit opera house or madhya mumbai ke dadar main visphot kii ghatnaayen hui hai
 The Home Department has described the serial blasts in Mumbai as a terrorist attack

 It is a logical culmination that these marks are made from Ram Singh's teeth
 yah tulana anya chaar sandigdhon ke sambandh main sahi nahin he
 "he said," On the basis of comparison with the tooth bite marks in the fifth picture and the tooth model of the five suspects, there is a strong possibility that Akshay gave these marks to him
 yah tulana shesh chaar sandigdhon ke sambandh main sahi nahin he
 On this, when defense counsel VK Anand told the witness that words like 'possibility', 'perhaps' in his report indicated that it was not reliable, concrete and could not proceed further
 uske baad gavaah unhen nischitata ke vibhinn digriyon ke bare main bataane lage or kaha ki unka istemaal, jab ye report taiyaar kii jaati hai, kiya jaataa he
 He also told them what each level meant
 adaalat kii kaarywahi ke dauraan maahaul tab garam ho gaya jab vishesh lok abhiyojak dayaan krishnan or atirikt lok abhiyojak rajeev mohan kii aguwai main abhiyojan paksh ne aaropee vinay sharma ke vakil e pi singh ke sawaal par aapatti jataayi
 AP Singh wanted to know whether the doctor knew that the victim was a paramedical student before preparing his report
 is tarah kii poochtacha par abhiyojan paksh ne aapatti jataayi
 But when the witness said that he did not proceed according to the newspaper reports, the atmosphere became lighter
 forencik dantachikitsak ne yah bhi kaha, ‘yah kahana galat hoga ki meri report sahi nishkarsh par aadhaarit nahin he
 It would also be wrong to say that i have prepared my report at the behest of Delhi Police and to benefit the prosecution as the victim was a para medical student
 ’ unhone aaropee ke vakil ke is aarope kaa bhi khandan kiya ki vah aise forencik report banane ke liye sakasham nahin hai
 He said, 'I have not seen any rules or regulations as to whether a Bachelor of Dentistry (BDS) can give such a report
 yah to practice kii baat he ki bidies aisi report de saktaa he
 'it is noteworthy that this paramedical student was brutally gang-raped on 16 december
he died a kuch din baad singapore ke ek aspataal main uski maut ho gayi thi
 Mukesh, Ram Singh, Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta are the five accused on trial in the court
 11 march ko ram singh kii maut ho gayi thi, uske baad uske khilaaf adalati kaarywahi roak di gayi
 The sixth accused is a minor and is facing trial by the Juvenile Justice Board

 agar aap sochate hai ki jacleen ko jaiki naam pasand he, to aap galat he
 This Bollywood actress does not like to be called 'jackie' at all
 jacleen ne bataaya ki industry main vaise hi 2 jaiki hai, jaiki bhaganani or jaiki shroff, to mujhe jaiki mat kaho, acha nahin lagata
 Let us tell you that Jacqueline's film 'aladdin' came, then she was called during the interview by the name 'jackie'
 is par jacleen kaa kahana tha'jaiki nahin, jaik kaho'
 Jacqueline does not want anyone to call her 'jackie', although her upcoming film 'roy' co-star Arjun Rampal calls her Jackie, Hopefully, Jacqueline's industry friends will no longer call her Jackie! 'roy' and 'brothers' films are coming in 2015

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter rajasthan se pati-patni ke pavitra rishte ko sharmasaar karne vaali ghatana saamne ai he
 In Jhunjhunu, a debt-ridden husband from Rajasthan, after failing to repay the loan, handed over the debt to his wife
 karj dene vaala pati ke saamne hi kai dinon tak uski patni se dushkarm karte rahe
 On the complaint of the victim, the police has registered a case against half a dozen people including her husband, in-laws
 jaankaree ke mutabik, sann kar dene vaali yah ghatana 7 agast, 2016 kii he
 When the husband of the victim came home that night, he was severely drunk and was accompanied by a man named Khadim
 pati ne apni patni ko bataaya ki usne khaadim se kaaphi karj le rakhaa he or karj na chukaa paane kii sthiti main vah khaadim se apni patni kaa sauda kar chukaa he
 After that, that person named Khadim raped the victim that night in front of her husband
 iske baad peedita ke saath dushkarm kaa yah silsilaa puure saptaah bhar chalata rahaa
 During this time, apart from Khadim, persons named Nasreen, Abbas, Salim and Shamim also raped her
 peedita ne jab sasuraal waalon ko apane saath biit rahe dardanaak vaakye ko bataaya to unhone ulate use munh band rakhane kii hidaayat de di
 Not only this, in-laws told him that if he brought Rs 10 lakh from his maternal uncle, he would be spared
 ek saptaah tak mahila se dushkarm karne ke baad dendar use bechney kii yojana bana rahe the, lekin kisi tarah mahila ravivaar ko unke changul se bhaagane main safal rahi
 The victim has filed a complaint of gang rape in the police against half a dozen people including her husband and in-laws
 police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar, peedita kaa vivaah 17 july 2013 ko chidawa nivasee yuvak se hua tha
 Initially everything went well, but shortly after the marriage, the in-laws started harassing the victim for dowry
 peedita ke pati ne kaaphi karj bhi le rakhaa tha
 When the victim refused to bring the money from her maternal husband to pay her debt, she was treated barbarically
 saptaah par peedita ke saath dushkarmakarne ke baad dendar use bechney kii yojana bana rahe the, jiske liye ve peedita ko lekar kisi dur ke ilaake main gaye
 However, the victim managed to escape from there

 But he said no

 The GDP growth which used to be 9% has been 4% today

 akhir dilli vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak phir se vidrohi tevar main kyon nazar aa rahe hai? epaviupi kii lambii ladaai ke baad kya ye ladaai bhi lambii hone ja rahi he
 Why is it that when teachers go on a struggle, the society turns its back
 kya isaki vajah shikshak khud hai yaa samaaj ko pataa hi nahin he ki shikshakon kaa kaam kya he
 In the last few weeks there has been a common front at Delhi University
 bijepi se lekar congress or vam morcha se jude shikshak sanghathan ujisi kii ek gajet adhisuchana ke kilaaf ekajute ho gaye hai
 Teachers say that if this notification is not returned, then the crowd of hundreds which is seen in this hall and the number which is seen in this march outside the recent, may be out of job
 ujisi kaa aadesh left se lekar rhite tak ke shikshakon ko daraa gaya he
 According to an estimate, about five thousand ad hoc ad hoc teachers can go
 kya koi bhi sarkaar itani badi sankhya main naukariyon main katautee karne kaa jokhim uthaaegi
 The second question is to increase the workload of permanent teachers
 sthaayee shikshak kehete hai ki unka kaam badhaane se ve shikshan kaary ke saath insaaf nahin kar sakate balki ye karnaa mumkin nahin he
 This is not possible given the resources and facilities
 inaki koi sun nahin rahaa isliye aaj dilli vishvavidhyalayon ke shikshakon ne thali karchhi lekar dharna diya
 Listen to my voice type sab kii yahi shikaayat he ki koi hamaari nahin sun rahaa
 This is a proof that listening institutions do not listen or listen easily
 ham or aap jab sunenge ki ek sahaayak professor se hafte main 24 ghanta padhaane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he or unhen etraz he, to ho saktaa he ki hamen is baat se koi sahanubhuti nahin ho
 Do we know what it means to teach 24 hours? ek ghanta bolne ke liye kitni urja kii zarurat hoti he, kitni taiyaari kii hoti he
 i have to study for seven to eight hours daily for one hour of 'prime time' and there is no work left after an hour show
 teacher ek-ek ghante kaa ek din main teen class kya le sakate hai
 Constant speaking, keeping new facts fresh and speaking and creating better communication with students
 susheel mahapatra ne kuch chaatraon se poocha ki aapaki nazar main teacher kya karte hai
 Teachers should be happy that the students know what their hard work is
 lekin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki tamaam vishvavidlaayon main nahin padhaane vaale shikshakon kii ghor kami he
 If all the teachers do not teach, then how do universities go? phir to vaais chancelar se lekar principal tak koi kaam hi nahin karata hoga
 It is a picture but not a complete picture
 pichley kuch hafton main maine jajon kii samasya par prime time kiya
 Prime time for police personnel to work for fourteen-fourteen hours and also for shortage of doctors
 aaj baari shikshakon kii he
 We talked to a teacher about how much work they have to do for a lecture
 philhal diu ke ek shikshak ne bataaya ki unhen hafte main 14 se 16 ghante tak padhaanaa padataa he
 It is possible that those who work for eight hours daily for eight to four hours a week may not understand the teachers by listening to them
 diu ke teacher main mujhe kaha ki padhaanaa jise ham lacture kehete hai ek saghan gatividhi he
 You speak continuously for an hour, thinking to speak and thinking carefully whether the students understood it or not
 aapke paas class main ruk kar das minute sochane kaa, sanbhalane kaa vakt nahin hota he
 Teaching requires three to four hours of continuous reading at home or in the library every day
 padhaane ke liye taiyaari main har hafte ausatan pandrah ghante lag jate hai
 Now let's come to the assignment
 asinament ko ek kism kaa homework samajhiye
 a teacher has to do 120 assignment checks in a month
 ek asinament chah se pandrah pannon kaa hota he
 In whose investigation ten hours of the week goes
 paanch se das panne kaa hota he
 If the number of students in the class is more, then the number of assignments can also be more
 isliye agar aap shikshakon ke kaam ko sirf teen class kii sankhya se dekhenge to sahi nahin hoga
 Also keep in mind that teacher is also a kind of call center for students
 vyaktigat samasyaon se lekar saamaajik samasyaon main bhi hissedaar ho jaataa he
 There is no account of the time that goes into it
 kai shikshak chaatro ke liye recomendation likhte hai
 Wake up nights so that the student gets admission in a good university abroad or gets a scholarship
 aise ek patr likhane main shikshakon ke kai ghante chale jate hai
 The account of this work is not recorded in any memorial book from UGC to the society
 atendence register or pariksha ke numberon kaa data aplod karnaa or copy check karne kaa kaam to maine abhi bataaya bhi nahin
 You too will be sad and can vow never to become a teacher
 ye sirf padhaane kaa hisaab he
 i have not given account of administrative work because it becomes difficult to give every fine information in TV
 ujisi or vishvavidhyalay ummid bhi karata he ki har shikshak itnaa kaam karne ke baad research main bhi utana hi behatar kare
 It has happened that teachers who want to do only better teaching have been made less, meaning teaching will be considered only when you do research
 lekin din bhar ke itane kaam ke baad aap sochiye ki research karne ke liye kis librari main jayega
 Where will i go to write a new form? diu jaise vishvividhyalay main shikshakon ke paas apane kamare tak nahin hote
 Sometimes when all the teachers come to the college together, they do not even have chairs to sit in the staff form
 ye us vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he jahaan kisi ko 95 fisadi se kam par admician nahin miltaa lekin iske baavjood usee vishvavidhyalay kii itani saakh to he ki log 98 pratishat lekar diu hi aate hai
 So how would this credibility be created
 kya nahin padhaakar bani hogi
 Then what are the teachers demonstrating about kyonki ujisi chaahati he ki shikshak or zyaada padhaaen
 An assistant professor will have to teach 18 hours a week instead of 16 hours
 alag se chah ghante tutorils ke liye dene honge
 The associate professor will now have to teach 16 hours instead of 14 hours and 6 hours for tutorials
 professor ko 14 ghante padhaane ke or 6 ghante tutorils ke dene honge
 The UGC had previously included all these activities in the Direct Teaching Hours, but now its definition has been changed and the tutorials have been excluded from it, meaning the tutorial will not be considered as teaching
 or vishvavidhyalayon kaa to pataa nahin, lekin diu main ye vyavastha he jisamen teacher chaatro ke chote-chote samoohon ke saath alag se class letaa he jahaan unke saath main lacture ko lekar baat hoti he ki unhen samaj ai yaa nahin
 This class also becomes like a lecture
 jinata main samaj sakaa hum ab ujisi ne kaha he ki in 6 ghanton main tutorils bhi lene honge, seminar bhi karne karaane honge, prashasnic kaam bhi karnaa hoga, innovations bhi karnaa hoga or course ke content ko apadet bhi karnaa hoga
 No reason has been given as to why
 isse kya hoga, ham baat karenge lekin isi kaaran yah kaha ja rahaa he
 Increasing the workload of permanent teachers will reduce the chances of new jobs in universities
 isse yuva shikshakon ko naukari nahin milegi or kai varshon se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe shikshakon kii naukari chali jaaegi
 Only five thousand temporary teachers can be employed in Delhi University
 desh ke baaki vishvavidlaayon main shikshakon kaa pad kam hota chalaa jayega
 There will not be new jobs
 ab aap puuchhenge ki naukari kam ho jaaegi to kya fark padegaa
 Perfect question
 sirf ye baat kisi yuva se mat kahiyegaa jo piechdi yaa em phil kar desh ke liye padhaane kaa khwab dekh rahaa he
 Then we also want why our universities cannot become like the world's best universities
 ye baat aapaki sahi he
 Can be made absolutely, but we have to see why they are there
 abhi main privet vishvavidhyalay or sarkari vishvavidlaay kii bahes main nahin ghus rahaa
 That is a different issue
 harvard vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 7 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at Oxford University has a weight of 11 students
 landan skool of iconomix main ek shikshak par 12 chaatro kaa boj he
 The Delhi University has 20 students on one teacher
 shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki ujisi ke notification se har teacher par chaatro kaa bhaar or badhegaa or unke liye mumkin nahin hoga ki ve sabhi chaatro kaa khyaal rakh saken
 In the world's leading universities, a teacher has to teach only six hours a week
 ek taraf ham duniya ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, duusari taraf unke paimaanon ke khilaaf niyam bhi bana rahe hai
 In protest against this, the Teachers Association of Delhi University has not been checking the copy of 1 lakh thirty thousand students since May 24
 hazaron naukariyaan jane ke alaava unka kahana he ki teaching aavars main bahut zyaada badhat se research or prashasnic zimmedaariyon par dhyaan dene mushkil hoga
 The API (academic Performance Indicators) target on which teachers are promoted, especially assistant professors, will make their promotion difficult
 tippaniyan Temporary teachers are very bad
 unase shikshan ke alaava jis tarah ke kaam collejon main karaae jate hai wo agar main ginane laguun to aapaki shaam karaab ho jaaegi
 If your mood is fine, let me tell you a little bit
 maheene main ek yaa do baar yoga class main rahanaa hota he
 For this, one has to leave the house at five o'clock because the yoga class is at half past six
 agar padhaane kii class baarah baje se ho to aapako kalege main paanch ghante intazaar karnaa hota he
 One has to attend the days of Central and State Government, such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Good Governance
 in diwason main chaatro ko jamaa karne se lekar lunch coupon baantne kaa kaam shaamil hota he
 There is a departmental meeting on every third fourth day, many times the meeting is held during class time
 class chhod kar meeting main nahin gaye to prisimple naaraaz, class nahin gaye to chaatr naaraaz
 Creating, uploading data of college government work is all this work too
 college kii partiyon main asthaayee teacher security ke taur par maujuud rahete hai
 Temporary teachers have to do many such tasks in addition to teaching
 diu main paanch hazaar ke kareeb asthaayee shikshak kyon hai
 This is also a question
 iskaa matlab he itane shikshakon kii zarurat he to naukari kyon nahin di jaati
 Do you or do we know how many jobs are lost every year in all universities
 kitne pad asthaayee rah jate hai or sthaayee rup se bhare nahin jate
 In July 2014, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that 16,692 posts are approved in 39 central universities, out of which 6251 posts are vacant
 ye to khaali kii sankhya thi
 It would have been interesting to know that the posts which were not vacant were permanent appointments or temporary
 jaise diu main hi asthaayee shikshakon kii sankhya 5000 hazaar bataai jaati he
 If the statistics of the universities of all the states of the country came, it would be right to know how many posts are approved and how many posts are being appointed temporarily
 ham or aap jab sunenge ki ek sahaayak professor se hafte main 24 ghanta padhaane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he or unhen etraz he, to ho saktaa he ki hamen is baat se koi sahanubhuti nahin ho
 Do we know what it means to teach 24 hours? ek ghanta bolne ke liye kitni urja kii zarurat hoti he, kitni taiyaari kii hoti he
 i have to study for seven to eight hours daily for one hour of 'prime time' and there is no work left after an hour show
 teacher ek-ek ghante kaa ek din main teen class kya le sakate hai

 We talked to a teacher about how much work they have to do for a lecture
 philhal diu ke ek shikshak ne bataaya ki unhen hafte main 14 se 16 ghante tak padhaanaa padataa he
 It is possible that those who work for eight hours daily for eight to four hours a week may not understand the teachers by listening to them
 diu ke teacher main mujhe kaha ki padhaanaa jise ham lacture kehete hai ek saghan gatividhi he
 You speak continuously for an hour, thinking to speak and thinking carefully whether the students understood it or not
 aapke paas class main ruk kar das minute sochane kaa, sanbhalane kaa vakt nahin hota he
 Teaching requires three to four hours of continuous reading at home or in the library every day
 padhaane ke liye taiyaari main har hafte ausatan pandrah ghante lag jate hai
 Now let's come to the assignment
 asinament ko ek kism kaa homework samajhiye
 a teacher has to do 120 assignment checks in a month
 ek asinament chah se pandrah pannon kaa hota he
 In whose investigation ten hours of the week goes
 paanch se das panne kaa hota he
 If the number of students in the class is more, then the number of assignments can also be more
 isliye agar aap shikshakon ke kaam ko sirf teen class kii sankhya se dekhenge to sahi nahin hoga
 Also keep in mind that teacher is also a kind of call center for students
 vyaktigat samasyaon se lekar saamaajik samasyaon main bhi hissedaar ho jaataa he
 There is no account of the time that goes into it
 kai shikshak chaatro ke liye recomendation likhte hai
 Wake up nights so that the student gets admission in a good university abroad or gets a scholarship
 aise ek patr likhane main shikshakon ke kai ghante chale jate hai
 The account of this work is not recorded in any memorial book from UGC to the society
 atendence register or pariksha ke numberon kaa data aplod karnaa or copy check karne kaa kaam to maine abhi bataaya bhi nahin
 You too will be sad and can vow never to become a teacher
 ye sirf padhaane kaa hisaab he
 i have not given account of administrative work because it becomes difficult to give every fine information in TV
 ujisi or vishvavidhyalay ummid bhi karata he ki har shikshak itnaa kaam karne ke baad research main bhi utana hi behatar kare
 It has happened that teachers who want to do only better teaching have been made less, meaning teaching will be considered only when you do research
 lekin din bhar ke itane kaam ke baad aap sochiye ki research karne ke liye kis librari main jayega
 Where will i go to write a new form? diu jaise vishvividhyalay main shikshakon ke paas apane kamare tak nahin hote
 Sometimes when all the teachers come to the college together, they do not even have chairs to sit in the staff form
 ye us vishvavidhyalay kaa haal he jahaan kisi ko 95 fisadi se kam par admician nahin miltaa lekin iske baavjood usee vishvavidhyalay kii itani saakh to he ki log 98 pratishat lekar diu hi aate hai
 So how would this credibility be created
 kya nahin padhaakar bani hogi
 Then what are the teachers demonstrating about kyonki ujisi chaahati he ki shikshak or zyaada padhaaen
 An assistant professor will have to teach 18 hours a week instead of 16 hours
 alag se chah ghante tutorils ke liye dene honge
 The associate professor will now have to teach 16 hours instead of 14 hours and 6 hours for tutorials
 professor ko 14 ghante padhaane ke or 6 ghante tutorils ke dene honge
 The UGC had previously included all these activities in the Direct Teaching Hours, but now its definition has been changed and the tutorials have been excluded from it, meaning the tutorial will not be considered as teaching
 or vishvavidhyalayon kaa to pataa nahin, lekin diu main ye vyavastha he jisamen teacher chaatro ke chote-chote samoohon ke saath alag se class letaa he jahaan unke saath main lacture ko lekar baat hoti he ki unhen samaj ai yaa nahin
 This class also becomes like a lecture
 jinata main samaj sakaa hum ab ujisi ne kaha he ki in 6 ghanton main tutorils bhi lene honge, seminar bhi karne karaane honge, prashasnic kaam bhi karnaa hoga, innovations bhi karnaa hoga or course ke content ko apadet bhi karnaa hoga
 No reason has been given as to why
 isse kya hoga, ham baat karenge lekin isi kaaran yah kaha ja rahaa he
 Increasing the workload of permanent teachers will reduce the chances of new jobs in universities
 isse yuva shikshakon ko naukari nahin milegi or kai varshon se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe shikshakon kii naukari chali jaaegi
 Only five thousand temporary teachers can be employed in Delhi University
 desh ke baaki vishvavidlaayon main shikshakon kaa pad kam hota chalaa jayega
 There will not be new jobs
 ab aap puuchhenge ki naukari kam ho jaaegi to kya fark padegaa
 Perfect question
 sirf ye baat kisi yuva se mat kahiyegaa jo piechdi yaa em phil kar desh ke liye padhaane kaa khwab dekh rahaa he
 Then we also want why our universities cannot become like the world's best universities
 ye baat aapaki sahi he
 Can be made absolutely, but we have to see why they are there
 abhi main privet vishvavidhyalay or sarkari vishvavidlaay kii bahes main nahin ghus rahaa
 That is a different issue
 harvard vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 7 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at Oxford University has a weight of 11 students
 landan skool of iconomix main ek shikshak par 12 chaatro kaa boj he
 The Delhi University has 20 students on one teacher
 shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki ujisi ke notification se har teacher par chaatro kaa bhaar or badhegaa or unke liye mumkin nahin hoga ki ve sabhi chaatro kaa khyaal rakh saken
 In the world's leading universities, a teacher has to teach only six hours a week
 ek taraf ham duniya ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, duusari taraf unke paimaanon ke khilaaf niyam bhi bana rahe hai
 In protest against this, the Teachers Association of Delhi University has not been checking the copy of 1 lakh thirty thousand students since May 24
 hazaron naukariyaan jane ke alaava unka kahana he ki teaching aavars main bahut zyaada badhat se research or prashasnic zimmedaariyon par dhyaan dene mushkil hoga
 The API (academic Performance Indicators) target on which teachers are promoted, especially assistant professors, will make their promotion difficult
 tippaniyan Temporary teachers are very bad
 unase shikshan ke alaava jis tarah ke kaam collejon main karaae jate hai wo agar main ginane laguun to aapaki shaam karaab ho jaaegi
 If your mood is fine, let me tell you a little bit
 maheene main ek yaa do baar yoga class main rahanaa hota he
 For this, one has to leave the house at five o'clock because the yoga class is at half past six
 agar padhaane kii class baarah baje se ho to aapako kalege main paanch ghante intazaar karnaa hota he
 One has to attend the days of Central and State Government, such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Good Governance
 in diwason main chaatro ko jamaa karne se lekar lunch coupon baantne kaa kaam shaamil hota he
 There is a departmental meeting on every third fourth day, many times the meeting is held during class time
 class chhod kar meeting main nahin gaye to prisimple naaraaz, class nahin gaye to chaatr naaraaz
 Creating, uploading data of college government work is all this work too
 college kii partiyon main asthaayee teacher security ke taur par maujuud rahete hai
 Temporary teachers have to do many such tasks in addition to teaching
 diu main paanch hazaar ke kareeb asthaayee shikshak kyon hai
 This is also a question
 iskaa matlab he itane shikshakon kii zarurat he to naukari kyon nahin di jaati
 Do you or do we know how many jobs are lost every year in all universities
 kitne pad asthaayee rah jate hai or sthaayee rup se bhare nahin jate
 In July 2014, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that 16,692 posts are approved in 39 central universities, out of which 6251 posts are vacant
 ye to khaali kii sankhya thi
 It would have been interesting to know that the posts which were not vacant were permanent appointments or temporary
 jaise diu main hi asthaayee shikshakon kii sankhya 5000 hazaar bataai jaati he
 If the statistics of the universities of all the states of the country came, it would be right to know how many posts are approved and how many posts are being appointed temporarily
 susheel mahapatra ne kuch chaatraon se poocha ki aapaki nazar main teacher kya karte hai
 Teachers should be happy that the students know what their hard work is
 lekin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki tamaam vishvavidlaayon main nahin padhaane vaale shikshakon kii ghor kami he
 If all the teachers do not teach, then how do universities go? phir to vaais chancelar se lekar principal tak koi kaam hi nahin karata hoga
 It is a picture but not a complete picture
 pichley kuch hafton main maine jajon kii samasya par prime time kiya
 Prime time for police personnel to work for fourteen-fourteen hours and also for shortage of doctors
 aaj baari shikshakon kii he
 We talked to a teacher about how much work they have to do for a lecture

 ab aaiye asinament par
 Think of the assignment as a kind of homework
 ek shikshak ko ek maheene main 120 asinament check karne hote hai
 An assignment is six to fifteen pages
 jinaki jaanch main hafte kaa das ghanta chalaa jaataa he
 It is five to ten pages long
 agar class main chaatro kii sankhya zyaada he to asinament kii sankhya bhi zyaada ho sakati he
 Therefore, if you look at the work of teachers with just three classes, it will not be right
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki shikshak ek tarah se chaatro kaa kol centre bhi hota he
 Participates in issues ranging from personal problems to social problems
 usamen jo samay jaataa he uskaa koi hisaab kitaab nahin he
 Many teachers write recommendations for students
 raaton ko jaag jaag kar taaki chaatr ko videshon main kisi achche vishvavidhyalay main daakhila mil jaae yaa chaatravrutti mil jaae
 It takes teachers hours to write such a letter
 is kaam kaa hisaab ujisi se lekar samaaj kii kisi smriti pustika main darj nahin hota he
 i have not even told you about uploading the data of the attendance register and exam numbers and checking the copy
 aap bhi dukhi ho jaaenge or kabhi na teacher banane kii kasam kha sakate hai
 This is just the account of teaching
 prashasnic kaaryon kaa hisaab maine nahin diya he kyonki tivi main har baarik jaankaree dena mushkil ho jaataa he
 The UGC and the university also expect that every teacher after doing so much work should do equally well in research
 isse ye hua he ki jo teacher sirf behatar teaching karnaa chaahate hai, unhen kamatar bana diya gaya he, matlab padhaanaa tabhi padhaanaa mana jayega jab aap research karen
 But after so much work throughout the day, you wonder which library will go to do research
 nayaa parchaa likhane ke liye kahaan jayega
 In a university like DU, teachers do not even have their own rooms
 kabhi ek saath sabhi shikshak college aa jaaen to staff rup main unke baithne ke liye kursiyaan tak nahin hoti hai
 This is the condition of the university where no one gets admission at less than 95 per cent, but in spite of that the credibility of the same university is such that people come to DU with 98 per cent
 to yah saakh kaise bani hogi
 What would not have happened by teaching? to phir shikshak kin baton ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Because UGC wants teachers to teach more
 ek assistant professor ko hafte main 16 ghante kii jagah 18 ghante padhaanaa hoga
 Six hours of separate tutorials have to be given
 associat professor ko 14 ghante kii jagah ab 16 ghante padhaane honge or tutorils ke liye 6 ghante dene honge
 The professor will have 14 hours of teaching and 6 hours of tutorials
 ujisi ne in sab gatividhiyon ko pehle Direct Teaching Hours main shaamil kiya tha, magar ab isaki paribhaasha badal kar isamen se tutorils ko baahar kar diya gaya he matlab tutorial ko shikshan nahin mana jayega
 And universities are not known, but there is a system in DU where the teacher takes separate classes with small groups of students where they talk about the main lecture whether they understood it or not
 yah class bhi ek tarah se lacture jaisaa ho jaataa he
 Now i have understood that UGC has said that in these 6 hours, you will have to take tutorials, seminars, administrative work, innovation and update the content of the course
 kyon karnaa hoga isaki koi vajah nahin bataai gai he
 We will talk about what will happen with this, but that is why it is being said
 sthaayee shikshakon kaa kaary bhaar badha dene se vishvavidlaayon main nai naukariyon kii sambhaavnaaen kam ho jaaengi
 This will not give jobs to young teachers and will leave the job of teachers teaching temporarily for many years
 keval dilli vishvividhyalay main paanch hazaar asthaayee shikshakon kii naukari ja sakati he
 In the rest of the universities of the country, the post of teachers will continue to decrease
 nai naukariyaan nahin hongi
 Now you will ask what will be the difference if the job is reduced
 bilkul sahi sawaal he
 Do not just say this to a young person who is looking for the dream of teaching for the country by doing phd or M
 Phil
 phir ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki hamaare vishvavidhyalay duniya ke nami vishvavidhyalay ke jaise kyon nahin ban sakate
 This is your right bilkul ban sakate hai lekin hamen ye dekhnaa hoga ki wo kyon hai
 Right now i am not entering into a private university and government university debate
 wo alag masalaa he
 a teacher at Harvard University has a load of 7 students
 oxford vishvavidhyalay main ek shikshak par 11 chaatro kaa bhaar he
 a teacher at the London School of Economics has a burden of 12 students
 dilli vishvavidlaay main ek shikshak par 20 chaatr hai
 Teachers Association says that UGC notification will increase the burden of students on every teacher and it will not be possible for them to take care of all students
 duniya ke namchin vishvavidhyalayon main ek teacher ko hafte main chah ghante hi padhaane hote hai
 On the one hand we are dreaming of universities of the world, on the other hand we are also making rules against their standards
 iske virodh main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke shikshak sangh 24 may se 1 lakh tees hazaar chaatro kii copy nahin jaanch rahe hai
 In addition to going to thousands of jobs, he says that the increase in teaching hours will make it difficult to focus on research and administrative responsibilities
 jis API (academic Performance Indicators) torget par shikshakon kaa pramotion tay hota he, khaastaur par assistant professor kaa, usase unka pramotion mushkil ho jayega
 The comments asthaayee shikshakon kii bahut durgati he
 In addition to teaching from them, if i start counting the kind of work done in colleges, then your evening will be spoiled
 aapkaa mood thik rahe isliye thodaa sa bataae detaa hum
 Have to stay in a yoga class once or twice a month
 iske liye ghar se paanch baje nikalnaa hota he kyonki yoga class saadhe chah baje hoti he
 If the teaching class is from twelve o'clock, you have to wait for five hours in the college
 centre or rajya sarkaar ke diwason main shaamil hona padataa he,jaise svachh bharat abhiyaan,good garvanence
 These days range from depositing students to distributing lunch coupons
 har tisare chauthe din par vibhageeya baithak hoti he, kai baar meeting class ke samay ho jaati he
 Principal resentment if he did not leave class and went to meeting, student resentment if he did not go to class
 college ke sarkari kaaryon kaa data bananaa, aplod karnaa ye sab bhi kaam he
 In college parties, temporary teachers are present as security
 asthaayee shikshako ko is tarah ke kai kaary karne hote hai padhaane ke alaava
 DU has close to five thousand temporary teachers
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 This means that so many teachers are needed, so why not a job
 kya aap yaa ham jaanate hai ki sabhi vishvavidlaayon main kitni naukariyaan har saal nikalati hai
 How many posts remain temporary and are not filled permanently
 july 2014 main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 39 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main 16,692 pad manzur hai jinamein se 6251 pad khaali hai
 This was the number of empty
 jo pad khaali nahin the un par sthaayee niyukti thi yaa asthaayee ye jaananaa dilachasp hota
 For example, in DU itself, the number of temporary teachers is said to be 5000 thousand
 desh ke tamaam rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke aankade aa jate to sahi se pataa chalata ki kitne pad manzur hai or kitne padon par asthaayee taur par niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai
 This is just the account of teaching
 prashasnic kaaryon kaa hisaab maine nahin diya he kyonki tivi main har baarik jaankaree dena mushkil ho jaataa he
 The UGC and the university also expect that every teacher after doing so much work should do equally well in research

 centre or rajya sarkaar ke diwason main shaamil hona padataa he,jaise svachh bharat abhiyaan,good garvanence
 These days range from depositing students to distributing lunch coupons
 har tisare chauthe din par vibhageeya baithak hoti he, kai baar meeting class ke samay ho jaati he
 Principal resentment if he did not leave class and went to meeting, student resentment if he did not go to class
 college ke sarkari kaaryon kaa data bananaa, aplod karnaa ye sab bhi kaam he
 In college parties, temporary teachers are present as security
 asthaayee shikshako ko is tarah ke kai kaary karne hote hai padhaane ke alaava
 DU has close to five thousand temporary teachers
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 This means that so many teachers are needed, so why not a job
 kya aap yaa ham jaanate hai ki sabhi vishvavidlaayon main kitni naukariyaan har saal nikalati hai
 How many posts remain temporary and are not filled permanently
 july 2014 main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 39 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main 16,692 pad manzur hai jinamein se 6251 pad khaali hai
 This was the number of empty
 jo pad khaali nahin the un par sthaayee niyukti thi yaa asthaayee ye jaananaa dilachasp hota
 For example, in DU itself the number of temporary teachers is said to be 5000 thousand 
 desh ke tamaam rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon ke aankade aa jate to sahi se pataa chalata ki kitne pad manzur hai or kitne padon par asthaayee taur par niyuktiyaan ho rahi hai
 The UGC had previously included all these activities in the Direct Teaching Hours, but now its definition has been changed and the tutorials have been excluded from it, meaning the tutorial will not be considered as teaching
 or vishvavidhyalayon kaa to pataa nahin, lekin diu main ye vyavastha he jisamen teacher chaatro ke chote-chote samoohon ke saath alag se class letaa he jahaan unke saath main lacture ko lekar baat hoti he ki unhen samaj ai yaa nahin
 This class also becomes like a lecture
 jinata main samaj sakaa hum ab ujisi ne kaha he ki in 6 ghanton main tutorils bhi lene honge, seminar bhi karne karaane honge, prashasnic kaam bhi karnaa hoga, innovations bhi karnaa hoga or course ke content ko apadet bhi karnaa hoga
 No reason has been given as to why
 isse kya hoga, ham baat karenge lekin isi kaaran yah kaha ja rahaa he
 Increasing the workload of permanent teachers will reduce the chances of new jobs in universities
 isse yuva shikshakon ko naukari nahin milegi or kai varshon se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe shikshakon kii naukari chali jaaegi
 Only five thousand temporary teachers can be employed in Delhi University
 desh ke baaki vishvavidlaayon main shikshakon kaa pad kam hota chalaa jayega
 There will not be new jobs
 ab aap puuchhenge ki naukari kam ho jaaegi to kya fark padegaa
 Perfect question
 sirf ye baat kisi yuva se mat kahiyegaa jo piechdi yaa em phil kar desh ke liye padhaane kaa khwab dekh rahaa he
 Then we also want why our universities cannot become like the world's best universities
 ye baat aapaki sahi he
 Can be made absolutely, but we have to see why they are there

 In July 2014, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that 16,692 posts are approved in 39 central universities, out of which 6251 posts are vacant

 raily main siem yogi ne apane bhaashan ke dauraan bhartiya sena ko ‘modi ji kii sena’ bataaya tha
 After this, there was a lot of political rhetoric on his statement

 Also, the Commission had asked the Uttar Pradesh Election Office to give a detailed report on it
 siem yogi ne diya tha ye bayaanyogi adityanath ne gajiabad kii raily main kaha, ‘congress ke log aatankwaadiyon ko biryani khilaate the or modi ji kii sena unhen sirf goli or gola detii he

 About Sachin's last Test match, which started at the Wankhede Stadium, Lata said, 'I saw Sachin's batting and he played amazing
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki unhone ritair hone kaa faisla kar liya
 It would have been better if they had not retired
 'unhone kaha, sachin aaj jaisaa khele, use dekhakar mujhe laga ki wo abhi ek saal or khel sakate hai, par maaloom nahin unhone kya sochaa or kyon aisa kiya
 Lata said, 'I think Sachin is a great man
 sachin bahut bade cricketer hai ye duniya jaanati he lekin meri najar main wo bahut sharif insaan hai, bahut kam bolne vaale, bahut shant
 i never saw Sachin quarreling with anyone
 kabhi-kabhi unako galat out de diya jaataa he to bhi vah shikaayat nahin karte, bat pakad kar chale jate hai andar
 Who does this, the person gets angry but Sachin is very decent and good person
 'jab lata ji se poocha gaya ki kya wo sachin kaa aakhri match stadium jaakar dekhengi to unhone kaha, 'main soch to rahi hum or aaj jane vaali bhi thi
 But there is a little fear from the crowd, as many diseases are spread
 isliye aaj main gai nahin, varanaa main jane vaali thi
 He was asked if he has spoken to Sachin ever since Sachin has decided to retire, Lata said that he did not talk but he is saddened by the master blaster's decision
 unhone kaha, 'maine kisi se kabhi kaha tha ki unhen ritair nahin hona chahie, wo khel sakate hai or unhen khelnaa chahie kyonki unamem wo baat he
 Sachin is cricket, cricket is Sachin
 main donon ko alag alag nahin samajhati
 If they win, they live for cricket

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh will abstain from politics for 6 months
 somvaar subah digvijay singh congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mili
 Diggi then came to the Congress headquarters to meet Treasurer Motilal Vora and said goodbye to AICC for 6 months
 raajnneeti se brake lekar diggi raja narmada yatra par nikal rahe hai
 For now, he will continue as party general secretary, but will not see charge of any state
 congress ke diggaj mahasachiv or do baar kemadhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe diggi rajane raajnneeti se 6 maheene ke liye dur rahane kaa faisla liya he
 Diggi, who came to 24 Akbar Road for the last time before the break on Monday, handed over the party's work to treasurer Motilal Vora
 diggi philhal mahasachiv hone ke saath saath andhra pradesh ke prabharee bhi hai
 Prior to Rahul's Gujarat visit, he met party vice-president Rahul Gandhi and briefed him about his visit and wished Rahul all the best for his visit to Gujarat
 isse pehle wo shanivaar ko is silsile main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 It will take them 6 months in the 3300 km Narmada Parikrama
 digvijay is yatra ko gaiyr raajnneetik or aadhyatmik yatra bataa rahe hai
 Diggi may be calling his visit beyond a political motive, but his visit before the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections has created a political buzz in the state
 narmada ke kinare-kinare apni 3300 kilometre kii yatra ke dauraan diggi madhyapradesh kii 110 vidhansabha siton or gujarat kii 20 vidhansabha siton se guzrenge
 However, Diggi has refused to return to state politics
 madhya pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav 2003 main haarane ke baad diggi ne kaha tha ki, wo agle 10 saal koi chunaav nahin ladenge or unhone uskaa paalan bhi kiya
 He is the general secretary of the party since 2004, but a few months ago he requested Sonia Gandhi to take charge of all the states
 congress ne unhen party kii gatividhiyon se lagbhag mukt kar diya tha
 Now what will be his political future when Diggi returns to the organization after 6 months
 is par tamaam kayaas lagaaye ja rahe hai
 Digvijay has also written a letter to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh before this visit that, during his visit, arrangements for mobile toilets should be made, so that the Swachh Bharat Mission was successful
 darasal, digvijay ko lagata he ki, unki narmada yatra jangalon or gramin ilaaqon se hokar gujaregi, log khudbakhud isamen aa sakate hai, vahaan wo shauchalay naa hone kii vajah se avyavashtha fail sakati he
 This may lead to sabotage on the cleanliness mission
 saath hi apni yatra ko aadhyatmik or dharmik bataane vaale diggi ne tay kiya he ki, wo is dauraan koi raajnneetik bayaanbazi nahin karenge or naa hi soshal media par koi raajnneetik tippanee karenge
 He will retweet only the official tweets of Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party
 dilli main barish ke saath badi umas ke bich dengue or chikangunia ke nae maamle saamne aae hai
 On the basis of the cases reported till May 27, in the report issued by the MCD, where 40 cases of dengue have been reported, the cases of chikungunya in Delhi are rapidly moving towards the century
 27 may tak chikangunia ke 96 maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 It is to be noted here that till this time last year, there was not a single case of Chikungunya in Delhi
 lekin is saal main garmi kii shuruyaat se hi chikangunia ke maamle saamne aane lage hai
 At the same time, till May 27 last year, where 13 cases of dengue were reported, this time it has increased to 40
 umas he badi vajahemasidi ke health department kii maane to iske peeche sabase badi vajah he dilli main umas kaa badhanaa
 There has been a sultry in Delhi since last 1 week which has increased the number of mosquitoes
 vahiin ab khatra isliye bada he kyonki pichley hafte hui barish or uske baad umas kaa asar is hafte padegaa jisase ye ashanka he ki dengue or chikangunia ke maamle agle hafte or bad sakate hai
 Relief to South Delhi Although Chikungunya and Dengue cases are increasing in Delhi, but the news of the relief week has come for South Delhi because according to the South MCD, in the areas under the South MCD for the last one week, a single case of Mendengu and Chikungunya Has not surfaced
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main is saal 17 hajaar 314 gharon main machharon ke larva paae gaye hai vahiin 1612 logon ko ab tak prosicute kiya ja chukaa he
 Yogendra Yadav, who arrived in Delhi in support of the temporary staff of DTC sitting on a dharna for the past 7 days, said that no Supreme Court order for equal pay for equal work
 yah to hamaare samvidhan main likhi hui he or ye behad sharmnaak he ki azaadi ke 70 saal baad bhi logon ko samaan kaam ke liye samaan vetan kii ladaai ladani padati he
 DTC workers demand that all contract employees be regularized and equal pay for equal work
 aapako bataa den ki dilli parivahan nigam main ditisi workars unity centre (actu) ne 29 oktober ko ek divasiy hadtaal kaa notice diya he jise anya unionon - ditisi workars union (atak) or ditisi emplise congress (intak) ne apana samarthan diya he
 Further, while attacking Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Yogendra Yadav said that today Kejriwal's government is the same, Kejriwal used to roam in meetings during the election that if our government comes then all contract employees will be regularized
 yahi nahin, is kejariwal sarkaar kii chunaavon ke samay kiye gaye vaada khilaaphi kaa paap kahin na kahin ham par bhi laga hua he
 The government has fooled us
 Actually, the employees sitting in the demonstration say that the Kejriwal government had promised before the election that if their government is formed then 13,000 employees will be confirmed
 philhal 13 hajaar karmchaaree ditisi main contract par kaam karte hai
 Employees say that the government has fooled us
 kejariwal sarkaar ne esma (ESMA) laga diyakejariwal sarkaar ke dwaara barkhaast karmchaariyon ke sawaal par yogendra yadav ne kaha kii jo sarkaar kisi bhi andolan ko dabaane ke liye esma lagane kii jurrat karti he vah aamajan kii sarkaar nahin ho sakati
 This is a dictatorial government
 gyaat ho ki ditisi karmchaariyon keehadtalpar nirdayee kadam uthaate hue kejariwal sarkaar ne esma (ESMA) laga diya he
 Our demand has been fulfilled, the staff of J&T says that we are already warning the government
 hamaari maange puri kar lee jaaen
 We are still giving a month's time to the government to consider us
 agar 5 farvari tak hamen permanent nahin kiya gaya to sarkaar ke khilaaf raily nikaalkar pradarshan karenge
 This rally will be taken from the bus depot to Delhi Secretariat
 5 lakh log rojaanaa hi safar karte handilli kii ditisi bason kii agar baat kii jaae to in bason main lagbhag 5 lakh log rojaanaa hi safar karte hai
 Now, if the speed of DTC buses stops, then there can be a lot of trouble in Delhi
 aise main sarkaar ko in karmchaariyon se baat karke is samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa chahie
 So that those traveling in Delhi buses do not have any kind of trouble
 tees saal main sabase badi hadtaal hogiditisi karmchaaree union kaa daawa he ki somvaar ko hone vaali hadtaal beete 30 saal main sabase badi hadtaal hogi
 The claim is also that for the past several days, the strike of DTC employees is going to take the largest form on Monday
 haalanki, ravivaar ko isko tab jhatka laga jab samarthit union ne hadtaal se khud ko kiya alag kar liya
 All India Central Council of Trade Unions aicctu-delhi General Secretary Abhishek says that one of the four DTC unions, ie bjp-backed Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, has separated itself from the strike on Monday
 baavjood iske teen registerd union ab bhi hadtaal par hai or wo somvaar ko basen sadakon par nahin utaarenge
 The demands of the strike are: 1
 vetan katautee kaa circular turant waapas liya jaae
 2
 samaan kaam samaan vetan lagu kiya jaae
 3
 ditisi main bason ke bede ko badhaayaa jaae, jan parivahan kaa nijeekaran band ho
 The legal rights of employees are constantly being violated by the DTC management and the Delhi government
 karmchaariyon kii maangon kii andekhi karte hue or dilli ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay kaa galat tareeke se hawala dete hue ditisi prabandhan ne pichley 21 agast ko vetan katautee kaa circular jari kiya tha
 Why are the demands of increasing the number of buses? This decision of DTC employees is also very important for increasing pollution of trains in Delhi and providing affordable, accessible and sustainable public transport facilities to the general public
 dilli main ditisi saarvajanik yatayaat vyavastha kii ridh he lekin aaj dilli main bason kii baari kami he
 DTC has only 3000 buses while Delhi needs more than 10,000 buses
 bason kii sankhya badhane kii bajaay sarkaar dilli kii sadakon ko nijee cluster companiyon ke hawaale kar rahi he
 Keeping in mind the increasing fares and pollution of the Delhi Metro, DTC remains the only all-inclusive, inexpensive and pollution-free means of public transport
 aaj jab haryana or rajasthan main bhi roadways karmchaaree vahaan kii bhaajapa sarkaron dwaara kiye ja rahe nijeekaran or thekakaran ke viruddh lard rahe hai
 Then the Delhi government should take immediate action on the demands of the DTC employees in view of the interest of the people of Delhi
 10 hajaar se bhi zyada ditisi karmchaariyon hissaa liyaapako bataa den ki 25 se 28 sitambar ke bich dilli ke sabhi ditisi depo par hadtaal ke sambandh main strike bailat yani matdaan karaayaa gaya jisamen 98
 2 percent i
e
 more than 10 thousand DTC employees participated
 is matdaan ke baad hi ye faisla liya gaya ki somvaar ko ek divasiy hadtaal kii jaaegi
 Currently, a union has walked out of this strike
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki ye hadtaal kitni kaamyaab hoti he

 The UPA government at the center does not give money to the states so that it goes into the pocket of a few people and this is what has happened here in the BJP government
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar jaisi beemaari se ladane ke liye hamane soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon banaaya he, taaki aam janata kanoonee taur par sarkari jaankaree hasil kar sake

 In such a situation, we need reliable and struggling officials
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar party nai cametiyaan gathit karegi
 The new executive will include old and new faces inspired by Loknayak's struggles
 'unhone kaha, 'cametiyon main sabhi virgon kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa jayega
 Backward, most backward, Muslim and Dalit people will also be given responsibility

 The party organization is firmly involved in the preparation for the by-election
 chayan prakriya chal rahi he
 The former minister said, "our parliamentary board is engaged in the selection of candidates
" upachunaav main varishton ke saath hi nae pratyaashee bhi maidan main utrenge
 We will answer the opponents with full force
 sapa kii nai kaaryakarini jald hi ghoshit hogi
 The Samajwadi Party is focusing more on the 'overhauling' of the organization after the previous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections failed to use the alliance with Congress and BSP
 is baar vishwaasapaatr or parivaar ke jo log chunaav haare, unhen bhi sanghathan main jagah dene kii kavayad chal rahi he
 Political experts say that the by-election is a small part of the organization that will now be formed in SP
 inke liye sabase mahatvapurn he saal 2022 kaa chunaav
 For SP, 2022 is the last battle of existence, so an organization will be formed which contains everything
 upachunaav main sapa ke aage basapa se behatar pradarshan kii chunauti he, kyonki basapa bhi pehali baar upachunaav main utregi
 For this reason, the SP also wants to compromise small parties in the by-elections and take advantage of their vote bank
 yahi vajah he ki omprakash rajbhar kii suheldev bhartiya samaaj party (subhaspa) se gathbandhan kii baatcheet chal rahi he
 Sources reveal that right now one or two parties are contacting even more sps for the by-election
 sapa basapa main jo party behatar pradarshan karegi, 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav main usee kii badhat kii ummid jagegi
 While preparing the organization for the year 2022, the SP will try to integrate all the castes of the castes
 padmavati maamle main sansadeey cameti main guuruuvaar ko kareeb dhai ghante se zyada der tak sanjay lila bhansaali kii peshi hui
 Many questions were raised with Bhansali
 unhen kuch sawaalon ke likhit jawaab ke liye do hafte kaa vakt diya gaya he
 Know what questions the committee asked
 # 1
 Why did you show the film to some people in the media before sending the film to the censor board? what does this mean
 # 2
 You sent the film to the censor board on 11 November and announced by yourself that the film will be released on 1 December, while you know that the censor board has 68 days to give the certificate to the film
 apane khud se taarikh kaise tay kar lee? # 3
 When the dispute has been going on for the last year and a half, why didn't you take steps to fix it? # 4
 jab filmon main saare naam or saare kairactor itihaas se liye hue hai tab yah kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki film kaa itihaas se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 # 5
 kya yah baat sahi he ki aapane pehle karani sena ko yah vaada kiya tha ki film unhen dikhaaenge? # 6
 Does the film depict Johar's scene? Can Sati be shown in films? After the appearance before the Parliamentary Committee, Padmavati director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has also given clarification
 bhansaali ne kaha, 'meri film padmavati kii kahani itihaas par aadhaarit nahin he
 It is based on the poem by Malik Mohammad Jaisi
 ' bhansaali kaa yah bayaan nae vivaad ko janm de saktaa he
 Let us tell you that Malik Mohammad Jaisi composed an epic poem 'padmavat' in Awadhi
 yah rani padmini kii kahani he
 According to which, Mohit Sultan Alauddin Khilji as queen wanted to get him under any circumstances, for this he attacked Chittor, but with thousands of Rajput women, Rani Padmini jumped into the fire and committed Jauhar
 saavdhaanee baratate hue bijepi cms ne lagaaya padmavati par bain: jetalisanjay lila bhansaali or sensor board ke adhyaksh prasoon joshi sansad kii information or technolji cameti ke saamne pesh hue
 Prasoon Joshi appeared before 8 members of this 14-member committee
 bijepi se do sadasyon ne film par bain kii maang kii to shivasena ke sadsy ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 The rest of the members said that when the censor board has not approved the film, where does the question of ban arise? sansadeey cameti ke saamne prasoon joshi ne kaha ki unhone abhi tak film nahin dekhi he
 The regional committee will first see the film and then the Central Committee
 sensor board pehle exparts kii raay legaa phir kisi nattejey par pahonchega
 At the meeting, the censor board chief was asked if the promos of the film had been approved
 jis par unhone kaha, haa promo apruv the
 Some members also said that disputes are being lit up for commercial gains
 jab band ho gai film or tivi serials kii shootingsansad kii pitishan cameti ke saamne sunwyeestanding pitishan cameti ne film ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali, CBFC or soochna prasaaran mantralay ke adhikariyon ko saman kiya tha
 So that it can be found out what action has been taken in this case so far
 chittorgarh se bhaajapa saansad seepi joshi ne kaha, hamane is peetishan kamity main padmavati film par pratibandh kii maang kii he, kyonki is film main itihaas ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 The censor board passed the promos of the film, but has shown ghoomar dance in the proms which have objection
 hamane ye baat bhi kamity ke saamne rakhi
 In writing on behalf of director Bhansali, the committee was told that the film is based on the facts of history
 lekin jaais kii padmavat to ghatana ke kai sau saal baad likhaa gaya, wo satya kaise ho saktaa he? is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, kya padmavati, raja ratnasen or padmavati kaa mahal aaj bhi he wo kaalpanik he?kota se bhaajapa saansad om birla ne kaha, hamane peetishan kamity ke saamne apni baat rakh di he
 The director had told the committee in writing that the film has been made based on the facts of history
 sensorboard itihaas ke saath chhedchhad ko dekhe
 Promos given certificates or not? This censor board will tell, but the promos and trailers being shown, when the same is objectionable, then how objectionable will be in the film
 bitcoin ko lekar bharat main lagaataar ek taraf chintaa jataai ja rahi he

 This means that transactions can be done between two computers with the help of bitcoin

 Gandhian Anna Hazare, who witnessed the live telecast of the Parliament proceedings on the 'i Pad' during the fast in support of the Jan Lokpal Bill at the historic Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, expressed deep grief over the death of Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, the company that created it
 Said that his unmatched contribution to the world of technology will always be remembered
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 Click to participate Hazare wrote on his blog, 'steve Jobs will always be remembered for his unmatched contribution to the world of technology

 He said that Steve Jobs was among those who created the history of technology by bringing revolutionary changes and through this they united the world
 unke yogadan ko hameshaa yaad kiya jaayegaa
 Click to watch Aaj Tak LIVE TV Hazare said that events in the last few years in various countries have proved that technology has played an important role in spreading awareness and uniting people
 unhone kaha, ‘takanic samaaj ke dabe kuchle, anyaay or bhrashtachar se peedit logon ke liye ek prabhaavshaalee madhyam ho sakati he
 'gandhian Hazare said,' i used the technique (of jobs) in private (jobs) during the struggle for Jan Lokpal Bill

 He will always be remembered
 ’ You cannot complain that speeches are short in India
 kaam bhale kuch kam ho jaataa ho lekin bhaashan kabhi kam nahin hota
 Now it is not even related to elections
 or ho yah rahaa he ki bolte-bolte netaa apana sabar kho rahe hai
 Their criticisms have no meaning
 kyonki uske baad kuch aisa bayaan aa jaataa he ki aap fark karnaa bhul jate hai ki zyaada shame pehle ai thi yaa ab aani chahie
 Our tolerance for the declining level of democracy is increasing
 netaa khulkar sampradiya bayaan de rahe hai yaa aisa kuch kah rahe hai jisase saaf nazar aata he ki ek sampradaay ke prati nafrat failaane ke liye diya gaya he
 Everyone knows a little bit about why this is happening, but what will be the impact of this from youth to other parts of society, we should think ahead of the vote
 main baat kar rahaa hum karnataka se bijepi saansad or modi sarkaar ke mantri anant kumaar hegade ke bayaan kii
 Such statements used to portray the character of Mohalla's grandfather in films, but now such scenes have also reduced in films
 desh main samvidhan he, kanoon he, police he, court he
 Even then, a central minister says that the existence of a hand touching a Hindu girl should be abolished
 yani ve bheed ko yaa apane samarthakon ko kah rahe hai ki kanoon kii zarurat nahin he
 Another statement can be derived from this statement that one can touch a girl other than a Hindu girl
 meri ladki or uski ladki ke is bantwaare ko samajhnaa chahie
 An MP and Minister should say that we have made such a system that she does not discriminate against anyone, but they are saying that leave the system, the existence of the hand touching the Hindu girl will be eradicated
 yah bayaan sidhaa sidhaa sampradayik bayaan he
 And is also against women
 bharat kii ladakiyon kaa apmaan bhi he
 Anant Hegde has been making such statements earlier also
 ve yaheen nahin ruke balki karnataka ke pradesh adhyaksh dinesh gundu raav kii patni ko bhi ghaseet liya
 It is clear what is going on in the mind of Anant Kumar Hegde
 hegade ne twit kiya he ki 'main dinesh gundu raav se poochna chahta hum ki unhone kya hasil kiya? main unhen ek aise shaks ke taur par jaanata hum jo ek muslim mahila ke peeche bhaagate rahe hai
 This was a personal attack as Gundu Rao's wife is Muslim
 kisi bhi prakaar ke aise sampradayik bayanon se saavdhaan rahen
 This has been given with the aim of spreading hate directly
 anant kumaar hegade ek tarah se aaj ke yuvaaon kii nijee raay tay karnaa chaahate hai ki ve kisase shaadi karen, kisase pyaar karen
 Gundu Rao's wife is Muslim and both have been married for twenty five years
 kya aapako lagata he ki ek mantri kaa aisa kahana uchit he
 Gundu Rao's wife Tabu Rao has criticized Anant Kumar Hegde's tweet by a postwriter
 kendriya mantri hegade ne twit kiya he ki main dinesh gundu raav ko sirf isliye jaanata hum kyonki vah ek muslim ladki ke peeche bhaaga tha
 Yes i am born a Muslim but i am proud to be an Indian first
 bharat kaa samvidhan dharmanirpekshata kii buniyaad par bana he jo har vyakti ko vichaar, abhivyakti, aasthaa or puja kii swatantraaa detaa he
 i have never commented against any BJP leader
 main khud ko sasti raajnneeti main pyaade ke rup ghaseetne kii koshish kaa sakht virodh karti hum
 If they have the courage, then challenge my husband politically rather than hide stones behind the wife's sari
 ek mantri ko shobhaa nahin detaa ki vah is tarah ke mardwaadi or bhadakaau bayaan de
 Will there now be politics on who is married to whom
 aapako kerala kaa prasang aad hoga
 When Hadia got married and changed her religion, the National Investigation Agency was also raided
 hai court ne haadia kii shaadi ko radd kar diya tha magar vah supreme court se jeet gai
 The Supreme Court had also said in its judgment that the right to change religion is also a fundamental right
 supreme court ne kerala hai court ke faisle kii kadi aalochana bhi kii thi
 Why are statements like these aimed at inciting hatred towards a community
 samvidhan main bhaichaare kii baat kahi gai he
 Recently, BJP national president Amit Shah also gave a statement of the same tone
 pashchim bengal kii ek raily main
 Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians need not fear
 ek rashtriya dal ke adhyaksh apane bayaan main chaar dharmon ko suraksha kaa aashwaasan de rahe hai
 They can tell why they are leaving one, but it is clear what line they are drawing against a religion by becoming the protector of four religions
 in chaar dharmon ke logon ko bhi sochna chahie ki agar unhen kuch hoga to court police par bharosa karenge yaa amit shah par
 Then let Amit Shah declare that the Supreme Court will be our protector and messiah from today
 aap amit shah or anant hegade ke bayaan ko ek saath sunenge to aapako samaj aa jayega ki main kya kah rahaa hum
 Did you find any difference in the statement of the two
 aam taur par main bayanon ko lekar kaarykram kabhi kabhaar hi karata hum hamaare netaa rose hi aany bany sany bakate rahete hai magar amit shah or anant hegade ke bayaan aany baayan sany nahin hai
 Under their influence, a young person in your home can commit violence
 use lagegaa ki hindu ke naam par kisi par haath uthaa dena sahi he
 In such a situation, he can commit serious crimes
 aap apane bacchon ko aise bayanon se bachaaiye
 Communalism turns a human into a human bomb
 vah kab or kis baat par fat padegaa ye aapke niyantran main nahin he
 The statement of Nitin Gadkari, another minister in the Modi government, should be taken seriously
 nitin gadakari jaisaa mantri agar netaa kii pitayee kii baat kare to uchit nahin he
 Regardless of the dreams the leader has shown
 agar janata gadakari kii baat ko gambhirtha se le to desh main kanoon or vyavastha kaa sankat paidaa ho saktaa he
 Our representatives have to be kept under the protection of the army
 isliye janata se bhi apil he ki ve gadakari ke bayaan ke duusare hisse ko gambhirtha se na len
 Raising one's hand is also a crime
 peetane kii baat to chhod dijie
 Sometimes in the name of a Hindu or sometimes in the name of a public, there is no significant difference between these statements, which beat them up and cease to exist
 donon main hi hinsa kii kalpana he
 Leaders want that you should do the work of beating, go to jail, fight the case and rule them
 hamen nahin maaloom ki nitin gadakari kii nigaah main sapane bechney vaala netaa koun he
 Whether his party or another party, but Gadkari has not denied or clarified yet
 congress ke netaa kah rahe hai ki gadakari ne pradhanmantri modi kii taraf ishaara kiya he
 Had this happened, the Prime Minister would have removed them by now, how can they keep the person in their cabinet who talks about beating or mocking them for showing dreams
 gadakari ne apni taraf se safai nahin di magar bijepi ke netaa safai dene kaa abhyaas khub kar rahe hai
 It seems that there has been a lot of effort to understand this statement within the BJP
 ek baar phir se karnataka chalate hai
 Former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah also lost his temper and sat indecently with the woman
 video main aap dekh sakate hai ki apni baat rakhane ke liye mahila mez par jor se maarthi he or gusse main siddharmaiya uthte hai or uske haath se mike chin lete hai_ mike ke saath uskaa dupatta bhi sarak jaataa he
 Siddaramaiah was indecent in every respect
 mantri anant hegade ke bayaan par bijepi ne istipha nahin maanga magar siddharmaiya kii is harakat par rahul gandhi se poocha he ki vah kab istipha maangenge
 Siddaramaiah the woman who snatched the mic from her hand is named Jamila
 jamila ne kaha ki chunaav ke baad yahaan pehali baar vidhayak aae hai
 Siddaramaiah said if you don't get mlas
 is par mahila ne mez par haath markar kaha ki nahin sar, vidhayak nahin milte hai
 Do not meet at all
 bas siddharamaiya ko gussa aa gaya
 Mike takes it
 pehle kehete hai ki tameez se baat karo or mike chhinte hue kaha ki yahaan se chali jaao
 sit quietly
 jamila phir se bolne kii koshish karti he tab siddharmaiya uthakar khadey ho jate hai or dhamkee bhare lahaze main use baithne ke liye kehete hai, munh band rakhane kii baat kehete hai
 Surely the woman gave a hand to the table and killed it, but a leader must understand what is left of the marginalized public when he has no language and tolerance to behave in a civilized manner
 phir bhi is pratikriya par siddharmaiya uth kar khadey hote or aaraam se use baat bataa sakate the
 Talking about snatching the mic and closing the mouth does not suit a chosen representative
 siddharmaiya har lihaaj se is prasang main ek taqatvar shaks hai isliye unka aisa karnaa mahila par hamalaa karne ke baraabar mana janaa chahie
 It is indecent in every sense
 baad main jamila ne bayaan diya jiskaa is sandarbh main itnaa hi matlab he ki usne safai di lekin vahaan jo hote hue ham sabane dekha wo kahin se uchit nahin tha
 You will feel that there is some other issue in the country by the statements and antics of the leaders, but when you go among the people, you will know that there is some other issue for them
 vaise bhi media ne loktantric pradarshnon main dilchaspee lenaa band kar diya he
 Striking demonstrations no longer matter to him
 jo log dharna pradarshan main aate hai wo chaahate hai ki unako media dikhaae par unhen khud se ek sawaal karnaa chahie
 When the media shows someone else's sit-in demonstration, they see, think, think and gather information as to why the other part of the public is upset

 In protest against this, a group of more than 100 students were protesting outside Jharkhand Public Service Commission in Ranchi by forming a human chain
 apane admit card ke saath
 Our colleague Harbans said that about 5100 candidates were supposed to appear in the examination on May 25, 2017, but the result which came out after the court decision, the number of students increased to 34,664
 28 janvari ko pariksha honi thi or chaatro ko pataa chalata he 16 din pehle
 Sources told Harambas that it was difficult to make more than 34000 question papers in such haste, then these people broke the seal of the old question paper and got it printed again

 Students also say that the question in the essay section was asked to write an essay when Jharkhand is 16 years old, but it is going on in the 19th year

 a documentary has been made on this topic, Period End of Sentence

 The film has a special connection to Hindustan, as its story is woven on girls living in Hapur

 The film's executive producer is Guneet Monga
 film ko Rayka Zehtabchi ne diarect kiya he
 The story behind the making of this is interesting, in an article by an Oakwood School student who found shame in the village of India and lack of hygiene knowledge in India
 bacchon ne enjio ko contact kiya, fund ikattha or gaanv kii ladakiyon ke liye ek senetary banane vaali mashin donnet kii
 Then to create awareness in the village, a documentary was planned for shooting
 kisi he filofilm kii kahani shuru hoti he gaanv kii ladakiyon se puche gaye sawaal se ki period kya hota he? donon sawaal sunakar itnaa sharmaa jaati hai ki jawaab hi nahin detii
 Then the same question is asked to the boys studying in the village school
 wo kehete hai period vahi jo skool main ghanti bajane ke baad hota he
 The second boy says that this is a disease that occurs to women, it is heard
 yaheen se shuru hoti he documentry
 Hapur's Sneha has an important role in the story
 jo police main bhartee hona chaahati he
 a village where elderly women call the Periods God's will and dirty blood
 usee gaanv kii sneha kii soch alag he
 She says when Durga is called Mother Goddess, then why women are not allowed in the temple
 documentry main falaai naam kii sanstha or real life ke pedman arunachalam muranganatham kii entry bhi hoti he
 Their own sanitary machine is installed in the village, where girls understand the true meaning of sanitary use in the days of the period along with employment
 puri documentry ke kai seen bahut khaas hai, jaise pehali baar jab ladkiyaan senetary pad ko haath se chooti hai to unke chehre ke bhav
 Shame of buying a pad

 yah ek aisi vaardaat he jisamen mulgim sattadhari party kaa taqatvar vidhayak he
 Local police who never heard of the victim girl's complaint
 is maamle main court ko dakhal dena padaa tab jaakar kahin FIR darj hui
 Just a year before today, in July 2018, the CBI files a chargesheet
 saal biit gaya lekin mukademe kii ek bhi sunwaayee shuru nahin hui
 Alam is that no judge was found to hear this case
 ye na hota agar saal bhar pehle hi sarkaar or prashashan jaag jaataa
 But now the High Court said that the case will have to be decided within 45 days
 ab hoga insafab unnav kii gang rape peedita kaa hisaab bhi hoga
 The reason for his father being put in jail will also be asked
 use hiraasat main maar daalane par sawaal bhi hoga
 Accident on Rae Bareli Road will also be investigated
 peedita ke apharan par bhi daleel hogi
 That is, each case of this case, which is about two years old, will now open
 upi main bijepi vidhayak ke khauf or sarkaar kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se insaaf kii lau jo bujhane ke kareeb thi
 He has been again illuminated by the Supreme Court
 lihaaza unnav gang rape maamle main jo filein dabi padi thim
 The secrets that were hidden
 unhen ek ek karke ab supreme court ke saamne kholaa jayega
 Because now the Supreme Court has taken up this case in its hands to bring justice to the rape victim and her family
 upi ke unnav rape or accident se jude maamalon main supreme court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kai ahm faisle liye hai
 It is important to understand these one by one
 pehla faisla to ye ki unnav rape cond se jude sabhi paanch cese dilli transfar kiye jaaengen
 The hearing of the main case of Unnao rape will be completed within 45 days
 rape peedit ke parivaar ke saath hue sadak haadase kii jaanch 7 din main puri hogi
 The largest court has ordered immediate CRPF protection to the rape victim and his entire family, his lawyer
 upi sarkaar se peedit parivaar ko 25 lakh rupee kaa antarim muaavja dene ke liye kaha he
 The order for giving compensation of 20 lakh rupees for the family of the lawyer who was injured in the road accident
 court ne lakhanu ke aspataal main bhartee rape peedit or uske vakil kii medical report maangi he
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, after knowing the opinion of doctors and family, an order will be given to bring the rape victim and her lawyer to AIIMS in Delhi
 raibareli jail main band rape peedita ke chachaa ko dilli kii jail main transfar karne par bhi sunwaayee hogi
 bjp's expelled MLA Kuldeep Sengar tried hard to save himself on the strength of his strength, perhaps even getting relief
 magar raibareli road par hue peedita or uske parivaar ke accident ne vidhayak ji ko chaaron taraf se jakad liya he
 And now their work will not only be accounted but will be accounted for very soon
 samajhie vidhayak ji kaa gemover ho chukaa he
 And it is very possible that this criminal is also shifted from UP jail to some other jail
 kuldeep senger kii nakel ksaa janaa to tay he, magar apane vidhayak ko bachaane ke chakkar main uttar pradesh sarkaar ne bhi apni jabardast kirakiri kara lee
 Which fired two years in the name of CBI investigation
 or cese kii sunwaayee tak nahin shuru ho pai thi
 The UP government and the police-administration would have shown little seriousness in this matter
 to naa peedita kaa pita jail main bemaut maaraa jaataa
 Neither her relatives would have visited the accident, nor would she have been fighting for life and death in the hospital herself
 desh main ye kya ho rahaa he? kuch bhi kanoon ke hisaab se nahin ho rahaa he
 These two lines which came out of the words of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are telling the good governance of UP
 jise unnav gang rape ke is maamle ne sarebazar zaleel kar diya he
 Let us tell you that the victim of the Unnao rape case wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 16 days before the accident
 jisamen usne apane parivaar waalon kii jaan ko khatra bataaya tha
 The letter has not reached the Chief Justice since time
 lekin jab peedita kaa dard un tak pahunchaa to fouran ection liya gaya
 Within 24 hours, the Supreme Court has given hope to the justice of Unnao's daughter by giving a historic order to blow the UP government
 aapako bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko is maamle kii sunwaayee chif justise ranjan gogoi ,justise deepak gupta or justise aniruddh bose ne shuru kii
 Showing strictness in this case, the Supreme Court has ordered a thorough investigation of one aspect of the gang rape which took place on July 28, the incident on Rae Bareli Road

 (input bhashaa se bhi) The Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' has now advocated family planning, after it demanded the withdrawal of voting rights of Muslims
 'saamana' main kaha gaya he ki musalamaanon or isaayiyon kii badhati aabaadi se desh ke hinduon ke saamne khatara paidaa ho gaya he or hindu bhoomi kaa saanskrithik-saamaajik santulan bigadanaa tay he
 If Muslims want to be happy and healthy, then a small family is fine for them
 agar ye baat hamaari ore se kahi ja rahi he to ye desh or musalamaanon ke hit ke liye he
 Earlier, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had said in his article in 'saamana' that the franchise of Muslims should be withdrawn, then the politics of Muslim vote bank would end from the country
 unhone likhaa tha ki musalamaanon ke vot sirf saudebaaji ke liye uplabdh honge, to yah samaaj hameshaa gart main hi rahegaa, isliye vot bank kii raajnneeti khatm karne ke liye muslimon se voting kaa adhikaar chin lenaa chahie
 a few days ago, the leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, Sadhvi Thakur, also said that in view of the increasing population of Muslims and Christians, people of this community will have to be sterilized, because their growing population is a threat to Hindus
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki hinduon ko adhik se adhik bachche paidaa karne chahie, taaki vishwa par prabhaav ho
 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj had also said recently that when Hindus perform sterilization, Muslims should also get it done
 haalanki unhone spasht kiya, ham nahin chaahate ki desh ke musalamaanon or isaayiyon kii nasbandi kara di jaae, lekin parivaar niyojan to sabhi ko apnaanaa chahie

 kya africa ke royal british commandos ne duniya ke sabase bade anakonda ko maaraa jo 134 foot lanbaa or 2000 kilo se zyada vajan kaa tha? kya is saanp ko maarane main 37 din lage? kya isane 250 se zyada insaanon or 2300 se zyada jaanwaron ko maar daalaa tha?fasebuk yujar “ramakant Kajaria” ne ek vishalkay saanp kii photo post kii he, jo jangal main padaa hua he or saanp ke aasapaas use dekhne waalon kii bheed jamaa he
 The post that went viral with this photo claimed that "the world's largest anaconda was found in Africa's Amazon River
" isane 257 insaanon or 2325 jaanwaron ko maar daalaa tha
 It is 134 feet long and 2067 kg
 africa ke royal british commandos ko ise maarane main 37 din lage
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this claim is false
 viral ho rahi photo na sirf photoshop se banaai gai he, balki is photo ke saath jo bhi daawa kiya gaya he, tathyon ke hisaab se vah bhi sachai se koson dur he
 This post has been going viral on social media since last few years
 haalanki, “ramakant Kajaria” ne yah post 2015 main daali thi, lekin ise ab bhi kai log share kar rahe hai
 By the time the story is written, this post has been shared more than 1,24,000 times
 post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 There are many anomalies that are easily visible in this post being reviewed by AFWA
 jaise:• amejan nadi africa main nahin balki dakshini america main he
 • There is no such reliable news report anywhere that such a huge snake was killed somewhere, which has killed so many humans and animals
 • “africa royal british commandos” jaisi koi sanstha vajood main nahin he
 • In the viral post, the snake, which is claimed to have been killed in 37 days, does not show any conflict or wound marks anywhere in its photo
 • neshnal jeographic ( https: / / www
 nationalgeographic
 com / animals / reptiles / g / green-anaconda / ) ke mutabik, green anakonda duniya kaa sabase bada saanp mana jaataa he jisaki lambaai 30 foot tak hoti he
 But this post going viral claims that the snake is 137 feet long
 kamjor photoshopviral ho rahi photo ko behad kamjor photoshop kii madad se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 a close look at the snake present in the photo shows that it has been prepared by Photoshop
 reverse image search kii madad se is saanp kii asli tasviir internet se khoji ja sakati he
 Original photo: Photoshop photo: Conclusion This viral picture and the claim made with it is clear that this post has created a story through fake picture which has been going viral on social media for many years
 duniya ke sabase bade saanp ke bare main isi tarah ke kai video or tasviren pehle bhi internet par viral hoti rahi hai
 "snopes", a fact-checking international institution, has previously denied these claims

 Shiv Sena said on Wednesday that the BJP does not have the moral right to criticize student leader Kanhaiya Kumar after joining hands with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir
 shivasena ne sattarudh bhaajapa ko naseehat bhi di ki use jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh ke purv adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ke khilaaf rajdroh maamle kaa raajnneetik laabh nahin uthaanaa chahie
 The party said the BJP committed a 'sin' by shaking hands with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti
 usne kaha ki mahabuuba mufti sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ko shahid maanati hai
 The BJP was a part of the PDP government in Jammu and Kashmir but disassociated itself from the coalition last year
 dilli police ne kanhaiya kumaar evam anya ke khilaaf adaalat main somvaar ko aaropapatr daayar kiya tha or kaha tha ki farvari 2016 main jeenyu parisar main vah ek raily kaa netritv kar rahe the or unhone rajdroh ke naaron kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Shiv Sena in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana' said, 'BJP committed the biggest sin by joining hands with Mehbooba Mufti, who considers Afzal Guru a freedom fighter and a martyr
 ab bhaajapa ko apane phaayde ke liye kanhaiya ke khilaaf darj rajdroh maamle se raajnneetik laabh nahin lenaa chahie or na hi aisi koshish kerani chahie
 The party said that terrorists like Ajmal Kasab, convicted of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, were also given an opportunity to defend themselves
 usne kaha ki kumaar ko bhi apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya jayega
 He said that if the allegations against him are not true, they will not be able to stand in court
 party ne kaha, ‘kanhaiya kumaar achche vaktaa hai
 Even though he represents rebel and unemployed youth, he cannot shout slogans praising Afzal Guru or independence of Kashmir
 vaise bhi, bhaajapa ko kanhaiya kumaar kii ninda karne kaa kya naitik adhikaar he?'
 Shiv Sena sarcastically said, 'maharashtra BJP minister Girish Mahajan recently claimed that wherever he is sent, he will show his' magic' and ensure his party's victory in the elections
 ham bhaajapa se anurodh karte hai ki vah jeenyu main raashtra virodhiyon ko haraane ke liye unhen vahaan bheje, lekin unhen bataa de ki jeenyu main chunaav iviem ke madhyam se nahin hote hai

 film ke nirmaataa hai dinesh vijan or sahanirmaataa hai khud saf ali khan
 
 
 The film stars Saif Ali Khan, Ileana d'cruz, Preity Zinta, Kalki Kochlin, Ranveer Shorey and Govinda
 
 
 film main saf ali khan ke kirdaar kaa naam he yudi, or anchal ke kirdaar main hai eliana
 
 
 Both are authors, and write books
 
 
 yudi ek dilaphenk shaks hai, lekin bahut aalsee bhi hai
 
 
 a book by UD came six years ago, which became a huge hit and UD cuts six years in the success of this book
 
 
 phir achaanak use ehsaas hota he ki uski jeb khaali ho chuki he or paise kamaane ke liye use dobaaraa kaam shuru karnaa padegaa
 
 
 UD also avoids the commitments of marriage, due to which he has been broken up many times
 
 
 idhar, govinda ne ek aise abhinayta kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he, jiskaa kariyar doobane kii raah par he, or vah aisi hit film karnaa chahta he, jise multiplex or single-screen donon jagah ke darshak khub pasand karen
 
 
 So what will happen after Govinda's film, and Aanchal, ie Ileana, will be able to know the 'happy ending' of ud's life
 
 
 ab baat film kii khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 
 
 The first thing was the flaws
 
 
 'happy anding' aapako film 'lav aajkal' kii yaad dilaa sakati he, lihaaza kahani main aapako nayaapan nahin lagegaa
 
 
 i noticed a lack of story throughout the film
 
 
 film kaa zyaadaatar hissaa mukhya kirdaaron ke bich filmaae kuch hi seens ke sahare tikaa dikhaa
 
 
 In simple words, we can say that many entertaining scenes are seen in the film, but the story does not go ahead, and these scenes weaken the film
 
 
 ranvir shouri kaa hissaa film main bevajaah lagata he
 
 
 His character entertains, but the contribution to the story seems to be negligible
 
 
 duusare bhaag main film thodi khinchati bhi he
 
 
 It is also not that the film has only flaws
 
 
 so, khoobiyon kii baat karen to raaj or dike ke kahani kehane kaa tarika behad pasand aayaa
 
 
 The film will make you laugh at many places
 
 
 film main govinda achche lagate hai, or unka kaam bhi acha he
 At the same time, Saif also liked me in the film, and also liked his alter ego, ie his upper-form, with whom he talks in the film
 
 
 priti, kalki or eliana - teenon ne apane-apane kirdaaron ke saath nyaay kiya he
 
 
 The songs of the film have already been spoken by people, so it was a plus point for the film
 
 
 ranvir shouri kaa kirdaar atapata zarur he, lekin unka kaam kaabil-e-tarif he
 
 
 On the other hand, i also liked the editing of the film
 
 
 shaayad yuva peedi film ko pasand kar sakati he, isliye is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star

 apane vetan bhatton main badhotaree or naukari pakki karne kii maang ko lekar rajya ke sarkari aspataalon kii hajaaron norse hadtaal par chali gai thim
 At the same time, the state government had imposed ESMA due to prolonged strike
 iske baad bhi hadataali norsen kaam par nahin lauti
 As a result, the state government started the action to arrest him
 rajya ke swasth vibhaag ne hadataali nurson ke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj karai
 Prior to this there was a discussion between the nurses' organization and the top officials of the Health Department on the demands, but this dialogue failed
 hadataali nurson ne apni maangon ko jaij tehraaya
 On the other hand, due to the absence of nurses in government hospitals from cities to villages and towns, hundreds of patients have lost their lives
 darasal, doctoron ko pehle se tay kai oparation taalane pade hai
 Because there is no nurse in the hospital
 aise main kisi bhi marij ke oparation kaa jokhim doctor nahin uthaa rahe hai
 Many essential services have also come to a standstill due to the absence of nurses in the hospital for two weeks
 sarkari aspataalon main sirf immergency seva hi sanchalit ho rahi he
 That too mostly depends on the trainee nurses
 kya he nurson kii maang?rajya ke sabhi 27 jilon main nurson ne rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholaa hua he
 These nurses are demanding enhanced salary allowances as per their work
 unki yah bhi maang he ki kai saalon se kaam karne ke baavjood unki naukari niyamit nahin kii gai he
 Not only this, they are also not getting any government facility
 hadataali nurson ke mutabik, unke sanghathanon ne apni maangon ko lekar kai baar rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ko ultimatum bhi diya tha
 The health department officials were also told their compulsions, but the government did not take any action
 nurson ne sarkaar par lagaaya aropaunkaa aarope he ki bijepi sarkaar lagaataar unki maangon kii andekhi kar rahi he
 They are only being exploited in government hospitals
 vahiin rajya ke swasthya mantri ajay chandrakar kii daleel he ki hadataali nurson kii maangon par samuchit vichaar karne ke liesarkaarataiyaar he
 Provided nurses return to work in the hospital
 vahiin nurson kii daleel he ki sarkaar chaahe unhen giraftaar kare ve apni maangen manwaae bina kaam par waapas nahin lautengi
 However, despite the imposition of ESMA on striking nurses, the movement of nurses is not over
 unke manobal par bhi koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Therefore, to break this movement, the government department is preparing for the dismissal of all the striking nurses
 nurson ko chetavanee di ja rahi he ki wo yadi kaam par jald nahin lautin to unhen barkhaast kar unke pad par nai niyukti kar di jaaegi
 At present, the police have started putting the striking nurses in jail after the arrest of nearly 3,000 men
 un par esma kanoon ke tahat aparaadh panjibaddh kiya gaya he
 However, despite all this, the striking nurses are freshly elevated
 wo jail jane se bilkul bhi nahin dar rahi hai

 The Islamic educational institution Darul Uloom has issued a fatwa after the political uproar from the road to the Parliament over the president of AIMIM, Asaduddin Owaisi, who refused to speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 daarul ulum devband kii ore se jari fatve main kaha ki bharat mata kii jai bolnaa musalamaanon ke liye jaij nahin he

 ise skulon main hindu-muslim sabake liye padhanaa jaruri kiya gaya tha
 Now the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai is being made necessary for every Muslim
 yah donon masale ek hi jaise hai
 'love of Hindustan but do not believe in God' said Darul Uloom Muktiyas, 'vande Mataram was written from here that Hindustan is our homeland
 ham or hamaare purvaj yaheen paidaa hue hai
 This is our Madre Watan (motherland), we love it but we do not consider this country as our mother (god)
 'unhone aage kaha, musalmaan kyonki khuda ke ek hone kaa yakeen rakhte hai isliye wo khuda ke alaava kisi or kii puja nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, Muslims should be excluded from this song
 ab bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagane par majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, Bharat Mata is a goddess believed by a section whom she worships
 bharat mata devi ko yah log hindustan kii maalik va mukhtaar samajhate hai
 'no one can be forced' The Islamic educational institution said that Muslims who believe in Islam can never compromise with such slogans
 bhartiya samvidhan ke mutabik hindustan ke har shaks komajahabi aazaadeedi gai he
 No fanatics have the right to do any work against the law and force others to do illegal work
 bharat mata kii jai kehane waalon ke najadik iske myne main vatan kii puja shaamil he
 Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to raise such a slogan

 PM Narendra Modi has given a message to the people of Gujarat through a letter
 gujarat kii janata ke bich baante ja rahe is patr main piem modi ne apil kii he ki log jatvaad ke naam par nahin balki vikaas ke naam par vot den
 PM Modi has said in this letter written in Gujarati, 'remember what Gujarat was like 22 years ago
 aaj gujarat or vikaas ek duusare ke paryaay bane hai
 Therefore, we will not promote casteism, not casteism, not communism, but strengthen Gujarat with developmentalism
 vanshavaad se nahin, vikaswad se gujarat main saamaajik nyaay ko majboot banaaenge, parivaarwaad ko nahin, vikaswad se desh or rajya ke garibon kii madad karenge
 'PM Modi has appealed to the people to give the opportunity to serve once again in the coming elections of Gujarat and to take the development journey forward
 saath hi likhaa he ki mere liye gujarat meri aatma or bharat paramatma he
 Significantly, Gujarat has played an important role in Narendra Modi's journey from CM to PM
 narendra modi gujarat vikaas model ko lekar desh kii satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hue hai
 This is the reason that the opposition is trying to beat them in their own fort, then Narendra Modi is putting all his strength to save his fort
 aisa lag rahaa he ki 2019 kii ladaai gujarat main ladi ja rahi he
 If the victory in Gujarat will make Modi more strong, if the Congress gets success in the account then it can be a tremendous launching of Rahul Gandhi
 gujarat ko bijepi kaa durg kaha jaataa he
 The BJP has held the throne of power in Gujarat for the last two decades, winning consecutive elections in the last five assembly elections
 gujarat vidhansabha kii siyaasi ranbhumi ko chhathi baar bijepi ke varchasv ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi morcha sanbhaalane ke liye khud utar rahe hai
 The Gujarat assembly election has become a question of credibility for the Prime Minister and the BJP, so the Opposition sees an opportunity to stand again
 yahi vajah he ki narendra modi ko siyaasi maat dene ke liye vipakshi dal congress unheen ke durg kii gheraabandi karne main juty he

 It is reported that there will be a cabinet reshuffle on May 22, before the fourth anniversary of the UPA
 is pherbadal main kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kaa mantralay badla ja saktaa he or rail mantri pawan bansal ko kursi se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 If reliable sources are to be believed, the responsibility of the Law Ministry can be assigned to Manish Tiwari while the Railway Ministry can be given to CP Joshi
 yani manmohan singh ke cote ke dono mantri kii jagah 10 janpath ke kareebi morcha sanbhaalenge
 According to the information, after a long time, the role of cabinet expansion is being written by Ahmed Patel, political secretary of Sonia Gandhi
 is sambandh main guuruuvaar ko congress netaa eke antni or ahamed patel ne party adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 However, it is expected that Law Minister Ashwani Kumar may be given the Labor Ministry
 lekin yah tabhi sambhav he jab kendriya shram mantri mallikarjun khadge karnataka ke mukhyamantri banaae jaaen
 At the same time, the name of CP Joshi is discussed for the Railway Minister
 agar pawan bansal ko rail mantralay se hataaya jaataa he to si pi joshi kii yahaan intry ho sakati he
 Significantly, on Wednesday, the Supreme Court reprimanded the Law Minister in the case of changing the status report of CBI
 vahiin, rail mantri pawan kumaar bansal railway ghuscand ke maamle main fanse hai
 Actually, Bansal's nephew Vijay Singla has been accused of bargaining for the post of Railway Board
 kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kaa badalegaa mantralay!sutron ke mutabik supreme court kii talkh tippanee ke baad pradhanmantri ne kanoon mantri par karrwai karne kaa man bana liya he
 Manmohan Singh is considering changing the law minister

 Attorney General GE Vahanvati met the first PM on Thursday
 iske baad kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kii khud piem se milane kii khabaren ain
 However, Ashwini Kumar later denied it
 rail mantri pawan bansal kii jaaegi kursi!railway board main pad kii saudebaaji ke 'khel' kii aanch pawan bansal kii kursi tak pahunch gai he
 The CBI has arrested Vijay Singla, nephew of Railway Minister and an officer of Western Railway in this connection
 rail mantri ke bhaanje par 90 lakh rupee ghoose lene kaa aarope he
 This was followed by further revelations
 sibiai sutron kii maane to tabadale or niyukti ke liye vijay singla apane mamaa ke rasookh istemaal kar rahaa tha
 This was revealed by the phone call records of the accused
 sibiai ne bansal ke nijee sachiv rahul bhandari se bhi poochtacha kii or agali baari rail mantri kii ho sakati he
 In fact, Vijay Singla hinted at a big conspiracy in the interrogation, while Bansal denied any business relationship with him
 lekin singla kii companiyon ke dastavej in daavon ko khaarij karte hai
 Due to these reasons, the pressure of resignation has increased on the Railway Minister
 bhartiya mul kii dakshin africa model shashi naidu ne mahatma gandhi kaa vah adarsh vaakya apana liya he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki khud ko vaisaa banaaen, jaisaa aap duniya ko dekhnaa chaahate hai

 kareeb ek dashak se patrika ke pannon par apana varchasv banaae rakhane vaali naidu ko unke nae khitaab ne kuch nayaa karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Naidu, who heads the Alushi Model Management Company, now wants to use Bapu's motto for the company as well
 jab naidu ko unke nae khitaab ke bare main bataaya gaya to unhen vishwaas hi nahin hua
 He said that he had no beauty during school days, he had acne on his face and teeth also came out, but with his hard work, dedication and dedication, he established himself as a model
 pratispardhaa main angelina joli, pop gayika christina aguilera jaisi vishwa stareey jaani maani hastiyaan shaamil thim lekin ennechaem ke sampadak hejan angler ne kaha ki sarvadhik sexi mahila ke khitaab kii hakdaar naidu thim

 dilachasp baat yah he ki duniya bhar ke lakhon purushon kaa sapana hone ke baavjood naidu ke pati mark sandler unke nae khitaab main koi dilchaspee nahin rakhte
 According to Naidu, he said that he does not think anyone needs to tell them how beautiful i am
 unhone yah bhi mana ki unki agency main ab 18 saal kii umr kii ladakiyon ke saath spardhaa mushkil ho gai he
 He said that the time has come when i give myself a break, enough is enough

 ab paanchavi peedi ke netaa agle dashak main vishwa kii is duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha kii kaman sanbhaalenge
 So far 59-year-old Chinfing, who has held the post of vice-president, will replace Hu in March as President, while 57-year-old Li Qing will replace Prime Minister Wen Jiabao

 After being appointed as CPC chief, Xi said in his speech that corruption and the separation of party officials from the people are the main problems facing the country
 unhone kaha, ‘nai sthitiyon main hamaari party kai chunautiyon se jujh rahi he or party main kai aisi jwalanth samasyaayein hai jinke hal kii aavashyaktaa he khaskar bhrashtachar, logon se alag ho janaa
 This has happened due to some party officials putting too much emphasis on formalities and bureaucracy
 hamen in samasyaon kaa hal karne ke liye har prayaas karnaa chahie
 Xi Jinping has also been named the head of the People's Liberation Army, the world's largest army with 2
3 million personnel, with which the new leader will get complete freedom to run the world's most populous nation

 On the other hand, the new leader Xi grew cautiously, taking advantage of his association with power
 ek gram mukhiya se rashtriya str ke netaa pad tak pahunchane kaa unka safar koi bahut mushkil bharaa nahin rahaa he
 He is a 'dynastic' communist and his father Xi Jongshun was the former Deputy Prime Minister of the country
 shi ke pita desh ke up pradhanmantri rah chuke hai or kaha jaataa he ki party sansthaapak maotse tung ne unhen kaaphi pareshaan kiya tha
 His father Xi Jongshun served as the Deputy Prime Minister of the country from 1959 to 1962 and was stunned by Mao over his liberal views
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhen kuch samay tak jail main bhi kaid karke rakhaa gaya tha
 a graduate in chemical engineering from the prestigious Tsinghuha University in China, Xi became popular across China after marrying a famous Chinese folk singer, Peng Liyuan, who was extremely popular in the 1980s
 communist party kii shanghai ikai main bataur sachiv unki safal pari rahi thi or varsh 2008 ke beijing olympic ke acchhee tarah aayojan ko lekar unki khub saraahna hui thi

 At the domestic level also, ethnically minority areas Tibet and Xinjiang are under stress as demonstrations are being held against the Chinese rule

 On the other hand, China has deployed a large number of security forces in Xinjiang, the original area of ugur Muslim, to gain control of the fast growing East Turkistan Islamic Movement
 ‘ek putr niti’ ke chalate burjugon kii badhati taadaat tathaa amiron evam garibon ke bich badhati khai naye netritv ke samaksh badi chunauti ke rup main anya bade mudde hai

 Ethanol produced from sugarcane juice serves as fuel, and can be used to drive vehicles
 athenul kaa yadi acchhee tarah utpaadan or upyog shuru ho jaae, to yah desh ke liye sanjivani sabit hoga
 This is to say of senior sugar techie NK Shukla
 unki maane, to athenul ke utpaadan se desh na sirf eendhan ke maamle main aatmanirbhar ban jayega, balki parmaanu urja se hone vaale khataron kii ashanka bhi nahin rahegi
 He said that the production of ethanol from sugarcane is not only cheaper than other sources of energy, but is also environmentally safe
 unhone kaha ki nagpur main ek va mumbai main do basen aa chuki hai, jo athenul se chalengi
 Shukla said, "india is currently dependent on other countries for fuel
 
 
 aise main kachche tel ke aayaat or dijal par sabsidi dene main sarkaar kaa kaaphi dhan kharch ho rahaa he
 
 
 " unhone bataaya, "pichley varsh sarkaar ne aayaat par 75,000 karod rupee or dijal sabsidi par 1,12,000 karod rupee kii videshi mudra kharch kii thi

 " enke shukla ke anusaar, ek metric ton ganne se 75 litre athenul kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 This will increase the utilization of sugarcane and source of income, and thereafter there will be no problem in giving a fair price to the sugarcane farmers
 duusari ore, desh eendhan ke maamle main aatmanirbhar hoga or bhavishya main desh ko videshi karj ke boj se mukti milegi

 a sensational revelation has been revealed in two terror attacks in Punjab
 dinapur or pathankot in donon hi jagahon par hue aatanki hamalon main dehshatgardon ne sena kii vardi kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Such a big question arises as to how the uniform of the Indian Army gets attached to the terrorists
 jis vardi ko pahanane or utaarne kaa ek salikedaar kanoon he
 In the name of selling it, security and law in India are being ripped apart
 jaankaree ke mutabik, desh bhar main dukaanon main sena, biguef or police kii bardiyaan saj rahi hai
 Everything from caps to boots, shoes are hanging
 jacket, sweater, baij, star har cheez saream bik rahaa he
 This game of selling uniform is going on from Delhi to Pathankot and Sriganganagar to indore-jalandhar
 pathankot main itane bade aatanki hamale ke baad bhi khuleam vardi nilam ho rahi he
 Sleep is not broken even after such a panic

 Except the buyer, here the shopkeeper himself is saying that there can be a big lapse
 kyonki yahaan vardi ko kharidne or bechney main pahchaan patr kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The condition is that uniforms are being sold indiscriminately in many cities bordering the country
 rehadi patari par bechi jaati he sena kii vardisena kii vardi rehadi patari par beche jane vaala saamaan kii tarah he, jise koi bhi kharid saktaa he
 Infiltration is also easy in cities bordering Punjab and Rajasthan
 iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pakistan se bheji jane vaaliatankiyon kii khepkitani aasaani se vardi hasil kar leti he
 There is a big danger from the terrorists hiding in the uniforms of police and army
 lekin police-prashasan ko koi chintaa nahin he
 The strictest capital requirement is Delhi, which is the capital of the city
 lekin yahaan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 The old clothes sold in the market here benefit the poor, but they also carry the Army and Police badges
 jinhen koi bhi yahaan se kharid saktaa he
 Apparently, there may be a molester or a terrorist among the players
 aise main vardi beche jane main kadi sakhti or kaayade kanoon ko lagu karne kaa samay aa gaya he

 lekin is puure prachaar abhiyaan kii khaas baat yah he ki jahaan tejasvi yadav ne ek din prachaar kiya to is bijepi ne giriraaj singh ko puri tarah se isse dur rakhaa
 Giriraj Singh, known as the star campaigner of the BJP in Bihar, launched a fierce attack against CM Nitish Kumar during the Patna flood and water logging
 itnaa hi nahin unke samarthakon ne to unhen bihar kaa aglaa siem tak bataanaa shuru kar diya tha
 But all his rhetoric blew up when Bihar BJP President Sanjay Jaiswal said that whatever Giriraj has said is his personal opinion and not that of the party
 lekin giriraaj singh ke bayanon kii vajah se donon hi party ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich uhapoh kii sthiti bani thi or chunaav prachaar main bhi vah man se saath nahin aa rahe the
 Sensing the situation, BJP national president Amit Shah came forward and said that NDA will contest assembly elections in Bihar under Nitish Kumar
 yah giriraaj singh ke liye bada jhatka tha
 However, in the meantime, Giriraj also stopped making statements against Nitish Kumar
 haalanki unka chunaav prachaar main na utarana bhi mana ja rahaa he party ne kuch samay ke liye unase kinaaraa kar liya he yaa phir koi damp kar diya he
