 First nuclear bomb
 phir hydrogen bam or ab chemical bam
 Yes, fond of bombs, North Korean dictator Marshal Kim Jong-un does not know when and where his hobby will end? The world has not been able to recover from the hydrogen bomb test now that the new news has arrived
 khabar ye ki uttar korea ne chemical bam bhi bana liya he
 The US and Japan do not know, but the neighboring country South Korea is afraid of chemical bombs more than Kim's hydrogen bomb, because this chemical bomb of Kim will not only kill but will make him sick and tortured
 itnaa to tay he ki north korea kemarshall kim jong unako dhamkee dekar to daraaya nahin ja saktaa
 Otherwise it would not have happened when the US threatened him, then he would have done something that the whole world would have been shaken
 america ne pehali baar daraaya to usne missile test kiye
 Scared then atomic bomb tests
 or daraaya to usne hydrogen bam kaa test karke zalzala laa diya
 The world thought now what else could worsen the situation ahead of it
 magar ek phir usne america kii dhamkee kaa aisa jawaab diya ki duniya phir bagale jhaankne lagi he
 Kim's most 'destructive' plan has surfaced
 marshall kim bana rahaa he 'beemaari' bam
 Will attack with 'plague and smallpox'
 duniya par 'mahamari atake' kaa khatara mandara rahaa he
 Marshal Kim Jong-un has now prepared such a weapon that without bombing ammunition, he can put the whole human being to death
 kim kaa ye bam jab phutegaa to koi chechak se maregaa, to koi haije se
 If someone drowns the plague, then someone will die due to typhoid
 kyonki is baar north korea main jo taiyaar hua he wo he 'beemaari bam'
 The sensational report by the American thinktank Belfer Center, which revealed Kim's new feat, has set the world on fire

 In which it is clearly said that this work is being done in North Korea for a long time
 magar korea ke liye biochemical vepan nayaa nahin he
 Thousands of people died of cholera, typhus, typhoid and smallpox after the Korea War between 1950 and 1953
 jiske liye america ke jaivik hathiyaaron ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha
 Despite all the restrictions and warnings of the United Nations, including the United States, North Korea is now developing nuclear weapons as well as biological weapons
 uttar korea ke is nae beemaari bam duniya kii chintaa badha di he
 The report quoted Tae Yoong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat, as saying that North Korea had started developing chemical and biological weapons in the 1960s
 malaysia main farvari main kim jong-un ke bhai kim jong-naam kii ghaatak nerve agent VX ke jariye hatya ke baad ye ashanka kaaphi gaharaa gai thi ki ye ghaatak nerve agent uttar korea ke hi baio-technical institute se aayaa tha
 The North Korea Research Center also runs the North Korean Army
 taanashaah kim jong un is institute main hameshaa aata rahata he
 When Kim Jong-un visited the research center in 2015, his picture was also revealed
 dakshin korea kii khufia agency kaa maananaa he ki jaivik hathiyaar viksit karne ke liye uttar korea main kam se kam teen biological hathiyaar production unit hai
 With which many research centers are also connected, which are working fast towards developing biological weapons
 report main ashanka jataai gai he ki uttar korea kai ghaatak bimariyon ko failaane vaale jaivik hathiyaar bana rahaa he
 The United States considers them as deadly as plague, anthrax, smallpox and hemorrhagic fever
 lihaaza ab america samet puri duniya kii nigahen uttar korea ke parmaanu hathiyaar kaarykram ke alaava jaivik hathiyaaron par bhi gad gai he

 com / 1oceg8uxqy Bihar has never lagged behind in terms of revolution
 is baar bhi yahaan ek nai saamaajik kranti shuru hui he or saamaajik kranti kii shuruyaat kii he katihaar kii puja ne
 When the newlywed Pooja of Katihar district of Bihar could not find a toilet in her in-law's house, Pooja decided to leave Susral and returned to her maternal home
 ab uski saheliyaan bhi yahi baat doharaa rahi hai ki jahaan shauchalay nahin hoga, vah vahaan vivaah nahin karengi
 Yashoda, the widow of Sahadev Mandal of Nawabganj East Tola in Kursela police station area of katihar district, married his daughter Pooja with great fanfare six months before Prakash Mandal of Semapur Sakrauli in Barari block
 puja jab sasuraal pahunchi tab use khule main shouch jane ko kaha gaya, jisase uske nari man ko thes pahunchi
 Being a newlywed she could not open her mouth for a few days
 kuch dinon ke baad usne sasuraal waalon se ghar main shauchalay banavane kii baat kahi, lekin shauchalay nahin banwaaya gaya
 Eventually, Pooja broke back from her husband and in-laws and came back to her maternal home
 puja ne bataaya ki sasuraal waalon ne uske maayke pahunchakar use waapas aane ke liye bhi manaaya
 After this, the Panchayat also sat, in which it was decided that Pooja would not go to her in-laws' house till her in-laws built the toilets
 idhar, puja kii bachapan kii saheli savita kumari bhi kahati hai ki puja ne jis saamaajik kranti kaa bigul foonka he, usne hamaari bhi ankhen khol di hai
 All girls should not marry in a place where there is no toilet
 idhar, puja ke pati prakaash ab ghar main shauchalay banavaane ke liye sarkari madad kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that Parvati, the wife of Alakh Niranjan Tiwari, a resident of Sadishapur in Bihta, Patna, had also filed a complaint in the women's helpline in April last year for not having toilets in her in-laws and demanded divorce
 vah sasuraal main shauchalay ke liye pati se baraabar shikaayat karti thi, jiske kaaran pati aksar marpet karata tha
 In 2012, Parvati was sent to her maternal home by her husband, after which Parvati demanded divorce
 iske baad sulabh international parvati kii madad ke liye saamne aayaa
 Parvati, who is seeking a divorce from her husband for not having a toilet, was also honored by Sulabh International by giving him a cash award and a letter of honor last month
 parvati ke sasuraal sadishopur main shauchalay kaa nirmaan kaary puraa kar ho chukaa he or ab parvati apane sasuraal waapas laut chuki he

 dilli ke pragati maidan main smart city par ek mela laga he
 Big companies are present with solutions for today's urban life
 ye ve samaadhaan hai, jo bahut pehle se market main hai
 Some are also new
 inamen se kai samaadhaanon ko das-pandrah saalon se duniya se lekar bharat main hotel se lekar apartment main istemaal kiya ja chukaa he
 At Pragati Maidan, everyone is taking care of their own stalls and fulfilling the need of smart city ideas and goods, but now they are being brought to a place in the name of smart city, packaging is being done
 jaise ek company ne dikhaaya ki ab shahar main gali-gali main ghumkar kachra uthaane kii zarurat nahin he
 You throw garbage from your apartment, put it in the trash box outside the house, from there your garbage packet will reach a central system at a speed of seventy kilometers per hour through a pipe of three to ten kilometers
 pipe ke antim chor par khadey trek main kachare kaa packet apane-aap bharta jayega
 The truck will take this waste to the place where every waste will be sorted and used again
 gujarat main ban rahe smart city gift main is takanic kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, lekin mumbai main ek real estate company ne bhi apane 400 flaton ke liye yah vyavastha lagaai he
 But under Smart City, all these technologies will be sold in one place, fitted
 is takanic ko lagaana ek tarah se anivaary kar diya jayega, tabhi to smart city kehalaayegaa
 a lady took me to her stall
 vahaan mujhe bataaya gaya ki ve kai varshon se hotalon main apni takanic supplai kar rahe hai
 You may have noticed in many hotels that the switches are changing
 inke anusaar aap hotel main pravesh karenge or aap us hotel kaa ap downlod karenge
 After downloading, you will be able to open and close the curtain sitting on the bed from your phone
 bistar se uthakar baanhen failaakar pardaa hataanaa nahin padegaa
 Likewise, you can turn off the light, turn on the TV and open the door for anyone without having to pick up your elderly mother sitting abroad while using an ipad or any smart phone
 aap apane mobile phone par ghar main kya ho rahaa he, yah sab dekh sakate hai
 It was argued that now life has changed
 ghar main mata-pita or baccha videsh main, lekin is aplication se aap ghar par nazar rakh sakate hai
 While offering me coffee, Mohatrama said that our slogan is that our solution is as easy as making a cup of coffee
 maine bas puch liya ki ek kamare ke liye is aplication ko lagane main kitna kharchaa aayega, to hanskar boleen, bas dedh lakh rupee
 i said, then your coffee is really cheap
 dedh lakh kii ek coffee pi ja sakati he
 But you have to understand that as attractive as this solution sounds, is it for the average middle class citizen
 garib ko to chhod hi dijie
 Technology is entering our lives, it cannot be stopped
 hamaare hi desh main alag-alag sarkarein in takneekee samaadhaanon kaa istemaal kar rahi hai, bas, inhen ek nae naam se pukaara jane laga he - smart city
 However, the rights of ordinary citizens in smart cities are not clear yet
 jaise greater noida main kisi real estate company ko golf city yaa sports city ke naam par zamin di jaati he
 It will be high-tech, but everyone can go to that golf city
 yaheen hamen apni praathamikta samajhane kii zarurat he
 The name of Golf City will be named, but how many will be used
 usee tarah se yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki real estate company kii banaai smart city main rehadi-patari par dukaan lagaakar pet bharne waalon ko koi jagah nahin milegi
 You will say that this makes the city dirty, traffic jams, but it also fulfills your needs
 jab bhi lagata he ki aap mahangaa nahin kharid sakate, tab aap patari par jate hai ki nahin
 If he does not fill his stomach by putting a shop on the track, then who will give him employment
 sirf patari kii baat nahin he, aapke naagarik adhikaron kii bhi baat he
 i am not saying that everything will be wrong, but what is happening, do we and you clearly understand
 kya aap aisi vyavastha main rahanaa chahenge, jahaan har gali-nukkad par sisitivi se aap dekhe ja rahe hon
 Let someone else watch over your privacy
 logon ko raah chalate hue camere dekhakar apane kapade thik karne padenge
 Would you like your phone number or Aadhaar card number to be known to any agency, including your movement and food
 vah bhi real time main, yani jab aap kisi se mil rahe hon, kisi ko pataa chal rahaa ho ki aap kisase mil rahe hai
 It is being raised these days under the issue of privacy
 tippaniyan All the solutions of the smart city which have appeared there have been adopted in some form or the other in the housing society
 kuch samaadhaan behad mahange hai
 Going to the fair of Pragati Maidan, it was felt that smart city is a new possibility
 sarkaar ne ek lakh karod kaa bajet rakhaa he, so, zaahir he iske kai hissedaar honge or isamen kuch galat nahin he
 Business should be expanded, but at the cost of which and on the basis of what needs to be seen
 jaise ek tele-medicine system dekhte hue maine sawaal kiya ki isse doctor ko pataa to chal jayega ki 100 kilometre kii duuri par kisi centre main mariz kii report kya he, lekin doctor to vahiin he
 Till we do not increase the number of doctors, can you increase the capacity of doctor with technology
 behatar tareeke se jo doctor abhi 100 mariz dekh rahaa he, wo 1,000 dekhne lag saktaa he, lekin kya vah nyaay kar paaegaa
 That's why technical possibilities aside - they should be welcome, but think properly about human intervention
 jaise ek company ne dikhaaya ki ab shahar main gali-gali main ghumkar kachra uthaane kii zarurat nahin he
 You throw garbage from your apartment, put it in the trash box outside the house, from there your garbage packet will reach a central system at a speed of seventy kilometers per hour through a pipe of three to ten kilometers
 pipe ke antim chor par khadey trek main kachare kaa packet apane-aap bharta jayega

 hamaare hi desh main alag-alag sarkarein in takneekee samaadhaanon kaa istemaal kar rahi hai, bas, inhen ek nae naam se pukaara jane laga he - smart city
 However, the rights of ordinary citizens in smart cities are not clear yet
 jaise greater noida main kisi real estate company ko golf city yaa sports city ke naam par zamin di jaati he
 It will be high-tech, but everyone can go to that golf city
 yaheen hamen apni praathamikta samajhane kii zarurat he
 The name of Golf City will be named, but how many will be used
 usee tarah se yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki real estate company kii banaai smart city main rehadi-patari par dukaan lagaakar pet bharne waalon ko koi jagah nahin milegi
 You will say that this makes the city dirty, traffic jams, but it also fulfills your needs
 jab bhi lagata he ki aap mahangaa nahin kharid sakate, tab aap patari par jate hai ki nahin
 If he does not fill his stomach by putting a shop on the track, then who will give him employment
 sirf patari kii baat nahin he, aapke naagarik adhikaron kii bhi baat he
 i am not saying that everything will be wrong, but what is happening, do we and you clearly understand
 kya aap aisi vyavastha main rahanaa chahenge, jahaan har gali-nukkad par sisitivi se aap dekhe ja rahe hon
 Let someone else watch over your privacy
 logon ko raah chalate hue camere dekhakar apane kapade thik karne padenge
 Would you like your phone number or Aadhaar card number to be known to any agency, including your movement and food
 vah bhi real time main, yani jab aap kisi se mil rahe hon, kisi ko pataa chal rahaa ho ki aap kisase mil rahe hai
 It is being raised these days under the issue of privacy
 tippaniyan All the solutions of the smart city which have appeared there have been adopted in some form or the other in the housing society
 kuch samaadhaan behad mahange hai
 Going to the fair of Pragati Maidan, it was felt that smart city is a new possibility
 sarkaar ne ek lakh karod kaa bajet rakhaa he, so, zaahir he iske kai hissedaar honge or isamen kuch galat nahin he
 Business should be expanded, but at the cost of which and on the basis of what needs to be seen
 jaise ek tele-medicine system dekhte hue maine sawaal kiya ki isse doctor ko pataa to chal jayega ki 100 kilometre kii duuri par kisi centre main mariz kii report kya he, lekin doctor to vahiin he
 Till we do not increase the number of doctors, can you increase the capacity of doctor with technology
 behatar tareeke se jo doctor abhi 100 mariz dekh rahaa he, wo 1,000 dekhne lag saktaa he, lekin kya vah nyaay kar paaegaa
 That's why technical possibilities aside - they should be welcome, but think properly about human intervention
 ek mohatarama mujhe apane stall par le gayi
 There i was told that they have been supplying their technology to hotels for many years
 aapane kai hotalon main dekha hoga ki switch badal rahe hai
 According to them you will enter the hotel and you will download the app of that hotel
 downlod karne ke baad aap apane phone se bistar par baithe-baithe parde ko khol sakenge or band kar sakenge
 Getting up from the bed and spreading the arms will not remove the curtain
 isi tarah aap ai-pad yaa kisi bhi smart phone se batti band kar sakate hai, tivi on kar sakate hai or videsh main baithe-baithe apni buzurg mataji ko uthaae bina kisi ke liye daravaaza khol sakate hai
 You can see all that is happening at home on your mobile phone
 daleel yah di gai ki ab zindagi badal gai he
 Parents and children abroad at home, but with this application you can keep an eye on the home
 mohatarama ne mujhe coffee kii peshkash karte hue kaha ki hamaara naaraa bhi yahi he ki ek cap coffee banane jitna aasaan he hamaara samaadhaan
 i just asked how much it would cost to install this application for a room, then laughed and said, just one and a half lakh rupees
 maine kaha, tab to coffee aapaki vaaki behad sasti he
 a coffee of 1
5 lakhs can be drunk
 par aapako yah samajhnaa he ki yah samaadhaan jitna bhi aakarshak lage, kya yah ausat madhyam vargeey naagarik ke liye he
 Leave the poor at least takanic kaa hamaari zindagi main pravesh ho rahaa he, use roka nahin ja saktaa he
 In our own country, different governments are using these technological solutions, simply, they are being called by a new name - Smart City
 vaise smart city main saamaanya naagarik ke kya adhikaar honge, yah abhi saaf nahin he
 For example, in Greater Noida, a real estate company is given land in the name of Golf City or Sports City
 vah hai-tech to hoga hi, lekin kya har koi us golf city main ja saktaa he
 This is where we need to understand our priority
 golf city ke naam se naam to ho jayega, magar isse kitnon kaa kaam nikalegaa
 In the same way, it has to be understood that by setting up shop on the street in the smart city built by the real estate company, those who fill the stomach will not get any space
 aap kahenge ki isse shahar ganda hota he, trephic jam hota he, lekin isse aapaki zaruuratein bhi to puri hoti hai
 Whenever you feel that you cannot buy expensive, then you go on track or not
 agar vah patari par dukaan lagaakar pet nahin bharegaa to use rojgaar koun degaa
 It is not just a matter of track, it is also a matter of your civil rights
 main nahin kah rahaa hum ki sab galat hoga, par jo ho rahaa he, kya use ham or aap saaf-saaf samajhate hai
 Would you like to live in a system where you are being watched by CCTV at every street? aapaki niztaa par kisi or kii nigaah hon
 People have to fix their clothes by looking at the camera while walking
 kya aap yah chahenge ki aapke phone ke number yaa aadhaar card ke number se aapke aane-jane or khaane tak kaa kisi agency ko pataa chale
 That too in real time, that is, when you are meeting someone, someone is getting to know who you are meeting
 ise in dinon privesi ke masale ke tahat uthaaya ja rahaa he
 The comments smart city ke jitne bhi samaadhaan vahaan nazar aaen, ve kahin na kahin kisi na kisi rup main houseing sosayadi main apanaae ja chuke hai
 Some solutions are extremely expensive
 pragati maidan ke meley main jaakar laga ki smart city ek nai sambhaavna he
 The government has kept a budget of one lakh crore, so obviously it will have many stakeholders and there is nothing wrong in this
 bijness kaa vistaar hona chahie, par kiski keemat par or kis zarurat ke aadhaar par yah dekha janaa chahie
 For example, while looking at a tele-medicine system, i questioned that this would let the doctor know what is the report of the patient in a center 100 kilometers away, but the doctor is there
 jab tak ham doctoron kii sankhya nahin badhayenge, kya aap takanic se doctor kii kshamta badha sakate hai
 a doctor who is seeing 100 patients in a better way may see 1,000, but will he be able to do justice
 isiilie takneekee sambhaavnaaen ek taraf - unka swaagat hona chahie, lekin insaani hastkshep ke bare main thik se soch lijie
 It was argued that now life has changed
 ghar main mata-pita or baccha videsh main, lekin is aplication se aap ghar par nazar rakh sakate hai
 While offering me coffee, Mohatrama said that our slogan is that our solution is as easy as making a cup of coffee
 maine bas puch liya ki ek kamare ke liye is aplication ko lagane main kitna kharchaa aayega, to hanskar boleen, bas dedh lakh rupee
 i said, then your coffee is really cheap
 dedh lakh kii ek coffee pi ja sakati he
 But you have to understand that as attractive as this solution sounds, is it for the average middle class citizen

 BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain claimed that Uma Bharti would prove to be a 'game changer' in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, and with this fear, many Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, are making outrageous statements against him
 bijepi ke ek kaarykram main shaamil hone yahaan aaye shahanvaj hossain ne samvaadadaata sammelan main yah baat kahi
 Hussain claimed that Uma Bharti is the stalwart leader of the BJP who has amazing ability to change the entire scenario
 yahi kaaran he ki jaise hi bhaajapa ne uttar pradesh ke chunaavon main uma bharti kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kii congress or anya vipakshi dalon main khalabali much gayi
 He strongly objected to Rahul Gandhi's assertion that Uma Bharti was from outside Uttar Pradesh and said that Rahul Gandhi should remember that his grandmother contested elections from Chikkamagaluru despite being from Uttar Pradesh
 rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue hossain ne aarope lagaaya, ‘rahul gandhi uttar pradesh ko bhi maharashtra ke raste par le janaa chaahate hai jahaan kuch log bahari or marathi main bhed karte hai
 He said that Rahul Gandhi also has to understand that neither Article 370 of the Constitution is applicable in Uttar Pradesh like Jammu and Kashmir nor Article 371 is applicable like the Northeast states that people of other states of the country cannot contest there
 
 hossain ne daawa kiya ki uttar pradesh kii janata ke paas is baar ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sirf ek vikalp he or vah he bijepi
 Pointing to the alliance between Congress and Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, he said that both these parties are playing a game of fixing in the assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki is baar ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav desh kii rashtriya raajnneeti kii dasha or disha tay karenge
 When Shahnawaz Hussain was asked why the BJP embraced Baburam Kushwaha, who was expelled from the BSP on corruption charges, when the people of Uttar Pradesh claimed to be fed up with corruption by SP, BSP and Congress, Hussain said that Kushwaha Has separated itself from the election process of Uttar Pradesh
 lihaaja ab yah vishay chunaavon main koi mudda nahin rah gaya he
 Asked about the BJP not being able to declare its candidates in several key areas, including Varanasi so far, despite notification of the third phase elections in Uttar Pradesh, Hussain said that this is part of the bjp's electoral strategy
 anna hajaare ke ek baar phir pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke mudde par patr likhane ke bare main puche jane par unhone aarope lagaaya na sirf congress balki swayan pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar ne bhi janata ko diya apana vachan todaa he
 Hussain said that the Central Government of Congress has put such an ombudsman in front of the country which is nothing but a hoax
 unhone anna kii pradhanmantri ko likhi gai nayi chitthee ko sahi bataaya or sawaal khadaa kiya ki jaisaa lokapal laane kaa kendra sarkaar prayaas kar rahi he
 After all, what is its meaning? hossain ne naksal samasya ko deshvyapee samasya qaraar diya or kaha ki kal gadwa main teraa surakshakarmiyon kii hatya kii ghatana kii jitani bhi ninda kii jaye kam he
 Asked about the growing Naxal incidents in Jharkhand, he claimed that the bjp-led state government has been hardened against the Naxals
 jiske chalate hi ugravadi ghabara kar aisi ghatnaon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Describing the policies of the Central Government as a failure in this matter, he said that when the Home Minister of the country himself is busy trying to avoid a 2G case, then how will he keep an eye on the security of the country

 rail mantri mamata banerjee ne pashchim bengal kii vam sarkaar ke khilaaf dabaav ko or badhaate hue mangalvaar ko kendra se vahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii maang kii
 The West Bengal government should be sacked, Mamata, who has been demanding this from Home Minister p Chidambaram, told reporters after meeting her, "the center should sack the West Bengal government and impose President's rule there because to protect democracy
 It is necessary
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kendra sarkaar ko rajya main kanoon vyavastha behaal karne ke liye pehle dhara-355 kaa istemaal karnaa chahie or phir dhara-356 lagu kerani chahie
 Mamta alleged that the CPI (M) cadres are killing democracy in Bengal with the help of state machinery
 rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke alaava unhone yah maang bhi kii ki rajya ke shastraagaar se ‘‘makapa ke gundon ’’ dwaara kathith rup se luute gayi hathiyaaron kii baramadagi ke liye sena kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 Mamata went to meet Chidambaram along with the families of kidnapped constables Shabbir Mulla and Kanha Godai from West Bengal
 in donon kaa july main maovadiyon ne kathith rup se apharan kar liya tha
 He said, "it has been three months since the kidnapping of these constables but the Bengal police is not making any effort to trace them
 isiilie maine unke maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye chidambaram se guhaar lagaayi he
 About the outcome of his meeting with the Home Minister, the Trinamool Congress chief said, "I have given them all the information
" chidambaram ne kaha he ki constablon kaa pataa lagane ke liye jo bhi madad chahie, kendra dene ke liye taiyaar he
 "the dictatorship continues in the state
 He said," i trust the Home Minister
 vah ek sakasham mantri hai
 i hope he will work in accordance with the Constitution
 ’’ bengal ke mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya par prahaar karte hue mamata ne kaha ki maovadi or makapa bhai-bhai hai or mukhyamantri rajya main maovadi andolan ke stambh hai
 Asked if she was disappointed at the Center, the Railway Minister said, "we are knocking on the door of democracy for justice
" ’’ unhone kaha ki pashchim bengal main pichley 32 saal se koi kanoon vyavastha nahin he
 Mamta claimed that CPI (M) cadres are camping in Lalgarh, where prohibitory orders are in force
 unhone kaha ki jab vahaan makapa ke sashastr cader shivi laga rahe hai to anya raajnneetik dal vahaan kaise jaakar raajnneetik gatividhiyaan kar sakate hai ? sanyukt abhiyaan kaa kya nateeja hua ? yah loktantr kaa majaak he, taanaashaahee badastoor jari he
 Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed and responsible for the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in Pulwama, once again escaped the grip
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main use global aatanki ghoshit karne kii taiyaari thi
 But on this occasion China vetoed this proposal
 china ke is rukh par america use kadi chetavanee di he
 The question arises that if Masood Azhar was declared a global terrorist, how would it affect his health
 vaishvik aatanki ghoshit ho jane ke baad masood ajahar par yah 6 pratibandh lag jate
 - Masood Azhar's entry in countries around the world would be banned
 - iske alaava masood ajahar kisi bhi desh main aarthik gatividhiyaan nahin chalaa paata
 - All UN member states have to freeze Masood's bank accounts and property
 - masood ajahar se sambandhit vyaktiyon yaa uski sansthaaon ko koi madad nahin milti
 In addition, Pakistan also had to impose economic sanctions against Masood Azhar
 - bain ke baad pakistan ko masood ajahar ke teror camp or uske madrason ko bhi band karnaa padataa
 China's investment sinks and above all
 agar masood ajahar kaa naam UNSC kii global aatankwaadiyon vaali list main shaamil ho jaataa to pakistan ke FATF kii blike list main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna bahut zyada ho jaati
 She is already on the gray list of FATF
 FATF main blaclist hone ke baad pakistan par aarthik pratibandh lag jaaenge, isse china kaa pakistan main arabon dollar kaa nivesh dub saktaa he
 Why is China saving Masood Azhar? a question is that why China is saving a terrorist like Masood Azhar again and again by winning a fight with the whole world
 jaankaron kii maane to iske peeche sabase badi vajah he china pakistan aarthik galiyara 
 That is CPEC
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon kii reports ke mutabik, CPEC project pioke, khaybar pakhtoonkhwaah or baluchistan jaise kai samvedansheel ilaakon se gujarata he, jahaan iskaa virodh hota he
 Where the terrorist organizations are not hindered in the creation of CPEC because of Masood Azhar's close proximity to China

 It is being said that Nitish kept himself away from the event due to disputes within the SP, especially between the Mulayam and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 tippaniyan After the call of Mulayam Singh in the political circles of Lucknow, this news was officially given on Thursday evening that Nitish has given his consent to come to Lucknow

 In the by-elections in Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, the sp's victory has brought the bjp's rest and sleep
 ye donon siten purvanchal se aati hai or piem narendra modi kii karmbhumi banaras ke donon chor par hai
 Phulpur on one side and Gorakhpur on the other side
 upachunaav main sapa-basapa kii ekajutata se vipaksh ko mila jeet kaa formula piem modi ke liye bhi mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had selected the Banaras parliamentary seat for his karmabhoomi
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki puure purvanchal main sapa, basapa or congress puri tarah se saaf ho gai thi
 Mulayam Singh Yadav of SP could win only from Azamgarh seat
 unhen bhi jeetne main paseene chhot gaye the
 Let us know that Purvanchal has been deciding the power of UP
 2007 main mayawati kaa satta main aana rahaa ho yaa phir 2012 main akhilesh yadav ke netritv main sapa kii vaapasi, purvanchal kshetra se mili badi jeet ne hi ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 On the same lines, for the bjp's return to power in the UP 2017 assembly elections, Modi encamped in Banaras for three days and demolished the SP and the BSP
 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhuulakar sapa-basapa ek hue to purvanchal kii siyaasi hawa ne ek baar phir apana rukh badal liya he
 As a result of this, BJP has suffered a crushing defeat in Phulpur and Gorakhpur in the by-elections
 itnaa hi nahin, bhagava durg gorakhpur bhi puri tarah se dhwast ho gaya he
 This is also special because Gorakhpur is the work place of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and he has been an MP for the last five times
 itnaa hi nahin dipti siem keshav prasad maury bhi phulpur main apana kila nahin bachaa paae, jise aazaadee ke baad modi lahar main pehali baar 2014 main jeet mili thi
 Since the manner in which the SP has returned in the by-elections in both the seats of BJP, the political pundits are assuming that the BJP has slowed down in the state
 pichley ek saal main siem yogi ne bhale hi upi se baahar party ke liye maahaul banaaya ho, lekin ve khud kaa ghar nahin bachaa sake
 bjp's air has started to weaken in a year
 aise main purvanchal kii donon siton par bijepi kii haar kaa siyaasi asar banaras ko bhi apni jad main le saktaa he
 Opposition formula of victory: Opposition has got victory formula from Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections
 2014 ke baad se bijepi jis tarah se ek-ek karke vipaksh ko maat de rahi thi, aise main soobe ke upachunaav nattejey sanjivani sabit ho sakate hai
 After this victory, it is believed that the opposition can unite to defeat the BJP in 2019

 The BJP has always suffered on the basis of caste
 bihar,gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke baad upi ke upachunaav main bhi iskaa asar dikhaa
 Due to the coming together of SP BSP, Dalit, OBC, especially Yadav and Mu Slim voters voted in unison, while bjp's upper caste showed a split
 modi kii sansadeey seat banaras main bhi dalit, muslim or obisi matadaata ekajute hote hai to 2019 main modi ke liye kadaa muqabla saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Big challenge for Brand Modi: The coming together of Akhilesh and Mayawati can become a big challenge for Brand Modi

 bijepi saansad ramesh vidhudi ne kejariwal sarkaar ke barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar par chutki lee
 Vidhuri said that PM talks to the people of the country, informs them about their work, informs them about new government schemes
 ab kejariwal and party koi kaam to kar nahin paa rahi, to man kii baat kya karenge, isliye ye tan kii baat karne lage hai
 That is why one of his ministers made a CD talking about his body
 'dilli kii janata ko dhokhaa diya'ramesh vidhudi ne aarope lagaaya kickejarivalane dilli kii janata ko dhokhaa diya he or ab dhokhaa dene ke liye wo punjab pahunch gaye hai
 Ramesh Vidhuri said that he has not been able to show his face in Delhi, but if he wants to live in Punjab, then he should get the money of the people of Delhi and the Delhi government
 The facilities will have to be returned
 wo jo tankhwaah dilli sarkaar se le rahe hai, dilli main sarkari kharche par jis ghar main rah rahe hai, unhen in sabko lautaanaa chahie
 They are taking money from Delhi and are chanting, this will not do
 'dilli kii janata se munh chhipaakar bhaag rahe kejariwal'kejariwal ke apane upar hamale ke aarope kaa jawaab dete hue ramesh vidhudi ne kaha ki aisa kahaan hota he ki mahilaayein jaakar unhen gulab kaa phool den or unhen ye atake lage
 This is their fear, which has come due to not being able to protect women
 jo vaade dilli waalon se kiye the, wo saare vaade bina puure kiye wo dilli kii janata se munh chhupaakar bhaag rahe hai
 Because new acts are coming out of their ministers and mlas, to which there is no answer
 sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin dete, isliye dilli main rahane main inhen dar lagane laga he
 Ramesh Vidhudi also demanded Kejriwal to implement Right to Recall, which his party had talked about before the election, because now if this law comes into force, they will have to leave the chair

 Parrikar said, India finally achieved success in the deal, which had been pending for many years
 unhone kaha ki rafaal jet ko kareeb do saal kii avadhi main bhartiya vayusena main shaamil kar liya jayega
 The talks about the Rafale fighter plane were stuck due to its price and the hesitation in guaranteeing the 108 aircraft to be manufactured by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited on behalf of Desalt Aviation
 piem modi ne kaha, bharat main ladaaku vimaanon kii parichaalan sambandhi mahatvapurn jaruraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maine unase (oland) baatcheet kii or aagrah kiya ki saude ke tahat udaan bharne ke liye taiyaar sthiti laayak 36 rafel ladaaku vimaan jitani jaldi ho sake, muhaiyaa karaaen

 To date, the impact of Operation Hurriyat is gradually increasing
 enie lagaataar teror funding par jaanch kar rahi he, jisase ek ke baad ek kai khulaase ho rahe hai
 It is now learned that Hurriyat leaders used to transact with Pakistan in the name of education also
 hurriyat netaa pakistan main daakhila karwaane ke liye kareeb 25-30 lakh rupee vasuulate the
 Pakistan High Commission was also involved in this work
 algaavvaadi netaa is paison kaa upyog aatankwaadiyon kii madad karne main karte the
 Please tell that the trouble of Syed Ali Shah Geelani and his family, the separatist leader of Hurriyat and his family is increasing
 teror funding par 'ajtak' ke sting oparation ke baad enie kii jaanch padtaal main gilaani hi nahin, uske bete damaad bhi buree tarah ghir gaye hai
 Geelani's son was to be brought to Delhi but he did not come citing ill health
 'aaj tak' ke sting oparation main dikhaaya tha ki kaise hurriyat netaa aatank kii aag main jammu or kashmir ko jhonkne kii baat kar rahe hai
 When the AIA started investigating this sting, its roots reached Pakistan
 hurriyat ke netaaon or unke saath vatan se gaddari karne waalon par shikanja ksaa to isaki kadiyaan bharat main pakistan ke ucchayog tak judane lagi hai
 At the same time, among them all, Pakistan's High Commissioner in India Abdul Basit has said in a conversation with our colleague Mail Today that even before this, separatist leaders have been accused of this kind of times, but there is no truth in it
 iske pehleeniene chhapemari main saiyad ali shah gilaani kaa hastakshar kiya hua hurriyat kaa ek calendar baraamad kiya tha
 This terrorist calendar was recovered from the house of Geelani's son-in-law Altaf Funtus
 is calendar main taarikh dar taarikh kab kab kahaan-kahaan hangaamaa karnaa he, kahaan danga bhadakaana he, kahaan bavaal karana he, sab darj tha
 But Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's stance on Hurriyat is soft
 hurriyat kaa asli cheharaa saamne aane ke baad ye tay karnaa hoga ki aatank ke in aakaaon kii dukaan hameshaa hameshaa ke liye band ho
 Manish Paul is known in Bollywood as an actor and host
 ve aksar bollywood ke mahatvapurn aword sho kii ekaring karte dikhte hai
 Born on 3 August 1981, Manish is also famous for his weird poor mischief
 2016 main ve ek aisi hi ghatana ke liye charchaa main aae the
 It happened that during an event two years ago, host and actor Manish Paul and Anupam Kher's son Sikander were asked whether they would both like to work in a film based on homosexuality? So he hesitantly said yes
 yahaan tak ki homosexuality par besd film karne ke liye vah kitne sahaj hai iskaa namoona bhi pesh kar diya
 He said that he could do anything to show homosexuality and he carried out the liplock in front of the camera
 manish paul ne pichley saal apane berthde par ek badi party di thi
 In which many Bollywood and TV world celebrities attended
 jhalak dikhalaa sho ke pichley sijans main jaj raheen maadhuri dikshit ne bhi party atend kar manish paul ke berthde khaas banaaya tha

 Couple has said that there is no easy way to do this
 lekin aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 Jasmine Parente and Jeremy Kravelle, a resident of Nova Scotia, Canada, first got the things out of their diets and then started to work out together
 kapal ne sabase pehle khaane se chini kam kiya or junk food ko menu se baahar kar diya
 In about 10 months, Jasmin dropped from 133 kg to 79 kg, while Jeremy alone lost 43 kg
 View this post on instagramtoday has been pretty shitty 🤷🏽♀️
 i have some personal things going on with family, the laptop i bought yesterday broke this morning (full refund mind you) AND my kitty of 9 years had to be rushed to the vet this morning😿 (I may have to sell a kidney before i go pick him up🤦🏽♀️) I've eaten # breakfastcrack some carrot sticks and a DONUT (my go to stress food)
 ANYWAY usually i would say this day is a write off and call it quits 
 
 but there are lots of hours left, I’m going to force myself to work out some of this stress here shortly
 Wanted i wanted to post this picture to remind myself how things have changed
 Me on the left was 3 weight loss journey attempts ago in 2016
 i was 7 months post partum, on a ridiculous "smoothie diet", and had started a running app
 i gave up 2 weeks later and continued to gain
 ⁣ Look at me now
 
 this doesnt get easier
 
 ever
 
 we just get stronger

 It was Christmas time and they decided not to post their photos on social media
 iske baad jute gai khud ko badalane main
 Jasmin has been pregnant 2 times before
 isaki vajah se bhi unka vajan badha tha
 At the time of delivery of the second child, Jasmin's weight was 136 kg
 unhone kaha ki vajan badhane ke saath hi unki haalat aisi ho gai thi ki vah ghar se nikalnaa nahin chaahati thim
 There seemed to be angst and considerable pain in the legs
 lekin ab vah kaaphi badla hua mahasoos karti hai
 Shivaji and Suraj Anil Madhav Dave Prabhat Publications, New Delhi: Price: Rs
 500
 chhatrapati shivaji jin kaarnon se bhartiya janamanas par sadiyon se raaj kar rahe hai, use badi sundarataa se rakhane kaa ek praytn is pustak main kiya gaya he
 To understand the reasons for which Shivaji's national and international fame remains permanent, it is enough to read those eight-ten wonderful lines of Swami Vivekananda and historian Jadunath Sarkar quoted in this book
 saath hi, vartmaan bharat main sushasan kii sthapana ke liye kin baton par dhyaan dena chahie, shivaji ke madhyam se isaki bhi vistrut charchaa is main kii gai he
 This point is particularly underlined by the preface written by Narendra Modi
 use padhakar swayan modi kaa netritv-darshan bhi jhlak uthta he, jo pathak ke liye ek bonus kii tarah he
 Indians are familiar with Shivaji's image as a freedom-loving, patriotic, skilled and thoughtful Hindu warrior
 kintu shivaji ne jivan kaa bada hissaa apane rajya main ek adarsh, lokapriy or satyanishth shashan sthapit karke safaltaapurvak chalaane main bitaayaa, yah kam log jaanate hai
 As the author states, Shivaji "made ordinary people do unusual tasks, turning the ordinary-looking opportunity into extraordinary achievement
" ''aisi anek uplabdhiyon ke kaaran shivaji aaj ke bhartiya rajanetaaon ke liye sachmuch shiksha-sandarbh hai
 In this sense, this book is very timely and useful
 yah shivaji ke 22 mul ajna-patron tathaa unke shashan kii visheshtaon ke saath unki netritv-style kii bahumoolya jaankaree detii he
 It has been brought to prominence with many beautiful paintings, quotes and historical details
 lekin pathak ko ye jaankariyaan pustak main dhund-dhundhakar nikaalani padati hai kyonki prastuti main baari bikharaav he
 Along with the philosophy, character and work of Shivaji, the BJP governments of now and again break the consistency of the muttering text praising the leaders
 shivaji se milane vaali shiksha or sandesh thik se spasht hone se pehle hi vyatikram ke shikaar hokar peeche rah jate hai
 The incidental discussion of the work of the Vajpayee government and the governments of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh leaves Shivaji's subject unfinished
 saath hi, bich-bich main congress kii aalochana ke vividh prasang bhi aate rahete hai
 This is all from the beginning in the book (p
 15-16, 34-35, 42-43, 64-75, aadi)
 Due to this happening again and again one may feel that bjp's advocacy under the pretext of Shivaji is also an objective of the book
 tab koi pathak maayoos bhi ho saktaa he kyonki pustak ghoshit rup se shivaji kii netritv kala par he
 In such a situation, long commentaries on the current political scenario continuously disrupt the original text
 kuch tippaniyan vartmaan bharat kii kuvyavastha rekhaankit karti hai, to kai vivaran bilkul apraasangik bhi hai (jaise pri
 133–35)
 shivaji sambandhi sabhi baaten ek bhaag main ikatthi or krambaddh rahati, to vishay main ruchi rakhane vaale pathakon ke liye adhik upyogi hotin
 In its present form it has become slang
 shivaji ke shashan kaa academik vishleshan, sambandhit kathaayen, dastavej or rekhachitron ke saath-saath samakaleen raajnneetik tippaniyan koi saamanjasy nahin bana saki hai
 The details related to the end-note numbers given in the text are also not identical under the 'reference space' at the end of the book
 unase sandarbhon ko dekhne-jaanchane ke liye sari jaankaree nahin milti
 This is a drawback in terms of academic value
 sandarbh yaa to purna or samroop die jaaen, anyathaa unhen chhod hi diya jaae
 Otherwise, the seriousness of the book is affected
 jis mahatvakanksha ke saath yah pustak prastut he, usase aashaa kii ja sakati he ki iskaa ek sankshipt, lokapriy or chatropayogi sanskaran bhi prakashit ho jisamen keval shivaji vaali sari baaten kendrit rahen
 Sudhi Pathak will compare with him the situation of present India himself and will also draw the necessary conclusions
 namak utpaadan ke liye mashhoor nanva kasbe ke mahesh kii khushi kaa thikaana kal us samay nahin rahaa jab paanch saal pehle meley main khoi uski bahan ‘mamata’ raksha bandhan kii purv sandhya par use mil gai

 Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who is contesting from Bihar's Begusarai Lok Sabha seat, is asking the people for votes in a different way
 reliyon main vah filmi gane sunaakar janata ko rijhaane kii koshish karte hai
 In front of the party president Amit Shah, where the Muslim community has created a controversy by warning that if there is a need for three hands for the tomb, then Vande Mataram will be singing in this country and Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be told, while telling the people the song of the film Chitrapat - If my feet are tied tightly, then watch my movement
 
 
 shakeel badayunni ke likhe is geet ko mohammad rafee ne gaaya tha
 When Giriraj Singh was reciting the two main lines of the film song, the crowd was applauding
 giriraaj singh ne buudhvaar ko party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke kaarykram main apane bhaashan ke dauraan anya baton kii charchaa karne ke alaava kaha ki kuch log bihar kii dharti ko raktranjit karnaa chaahate hai, sampradayik aag failaana chaah rahe hai, lekin BJP jab tak he na bihar main aisa hoga or na begusarai kii dharti par ve aisa hone denge
 After that Giriraj while referring to a so-called statement of Abdul Bari Siddiqui candidate from Darbhanga of Rashtriya Janata Dal said that ‘RJD candidate says in Darbhanga that Vande Mataram i will not speak
 begusarai main bhi kuch log aakar bade bhai kaa kurtaa or chote bhai kaa pyjama pahanakar bhraman kar rahe hai
 But i want to tell them that those who cannot sing Vande Mataram, who cannot bow down to the motherland of India, remember that o Giriraj's maternal grandfather died on the banks of the Ganges in Simaria Ghat, a grave on the same land
 Not made but you need three hands
 tum aisa nahin kar paaoge to desh tumhen kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 After this, Giriraj finished his speech but certainly this part of the speech was shocking
 haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki giriraaj is baar jab nitish kumaar ke saath manch par hote hai tab ve sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas or sampradayik sadbhaav kaayam rakhane kii baaten karte hai lekin jab ve apane manch par or apni party ke varisht netaaon ke saamne bol rahe hote hai to muslim samudaay ke logon ko nishane par rakhane se nahin chookte
 The second reason for this is also being told that this time due to the triangular competition in Begusarai, he has got the idea or is part of his thoughtful strategy that unless the communal polarization is there then the path of his victory will be easy Will not done
 isliye unhone jaanboojhkar vande maataram, bharat mata kii jai or kabristaan or kabr ke liye jameen kaa mudda chhedaa he
 NDA candidate from Begusarai Giriraj Singh has warned the people of the Muslim community from the platform in front of the party's national president Amit Shah that if three hands are needed for the tomb, then Vande Mataram will be sung in this country and say Bharat Mata ki Jai

 When (union Home Minister) Amit Shah introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, he made it clear that there would be no place for a showdown in India
 unhone kaha, "pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh ke sharnaarthiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta nahin di ja sakati
 
 
 "however before that he also said," Indian Muslims have no reason to fear
 
 
 "bhartiya muslimon ko shah dwaara diya gaya aashwaasan khokhla kyon mahasoos hota he
 
 
 The One reason is that (prime Minister Narendra) Modi and Amit Shah's attitude towards Indian citizenship is clearly visible in the CAB
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, 1947 main bharat kaa vibhaajan dharmik aadhaar par hua tha - muslimon ne pakistan le liya, or hinduon ko bharat mila
 modi-shah's view of Indian history fails to tell us that not only India but Pakistan was born with the idea of equality for all religions
 11 agast, 1947 ko pakistan kii samvidhan sabha main die bhaashan main mohammad ali jinna ne kaha tha, "pakistan main aap apane mandiron main jane ke liye azaad hai, aap apni masjidon main yaa kisi bhi anya poojasthal par jane ke liye azaad hai
 
 
 You can be of any religion or caste or sect - it will have nothing to do with the country
 
 
 "kabhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sangrakshak rahe laalkrishna adwani ne june, 2005 main jinna ke makbare ke daure main isi bhaashan ko yaad kiya tha, or pakistan ke sansthaapak ko 'hindu-muslim ekta kaa doot' qaraar diya tha
 Of course, we know that just a few months after Jinnah's death in 1948, Pakistan took the first step towards becoming an Islamic republic, when (pakistan's first Prime Minister) Liaquat Ali Khan declared, "the whole work is just on It is the rule of Allah
 
 
 ' (samooche brahmad par sirf upar vaale kaa hi shashan he
 
 
 ) The point is that millions of crores of Muslims chose Pakistan before it became an Islamic state
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he, ve us desh main mahfuz mahasoos karte the, jahaan muslim bahutayat main the, lekin ve aisa mulk nahin chaahate the, jisaki buniyaad islam par tiki ho
 Such Muslims also had as much right to return to India after being subjected to religious atrocities as Hindus, who decided to settle in Pakistan after the tax
 tatkaaleen purvi pakistan main yah baat or bhi zyaada majbooti se saamne ai
 The formation of Bangladesh challenged the idea that Muslims settled in the subcontinent formed a new country
 bengali musalamaanon ne tay kiya tha ki unki rashtriyata kaa aadhaar bhashaa hogi, or ve punjabi or sindhi musalamaanon se katai alag hai
 Indeed, even though Bangladesh's Ain (constitution) made in 1972 begins with a call to Allah, it declares itself to be committed to 'nationalism, socialism, democracy' and 'secularism'
 varsh 1977 main zia-ur-rahamaan ne 'dharmanirpeksh' lafz ko samvidhan se hataa diya tha, or uske kai saal baad 1988 main general irshaad ne bangladesh ko islamic ganraajya ghoshit kiya tha
 Now it can be said for debate that there are millions of Bangladeshi Muslims like Taslima Nasreen who feel oppressed due to walking on the religious path of their country
 aise log shartiya chahenge ki unhen bharat jaise kisi dharmanirpeksh desh kii naagarikta hasil ho sake
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill completely negates any such possibility, refusing to recognize even its rationale
 agar samajha jaae, to CAB ke mutabik, bhale hi muslimon ne mana tha ki pakistan or bangladesh dharmanirpeksh honge, lekin unhone chunaav 1947 main hi kar liya tha
 On the other hand, Hindus still have the right to choose this, because India is naturally home to Hindus
 unke saath-saath paanch anya dharmon ke liye bhi darvaaze khole gaye hai, jinamein se teen to hindu personal lau ke tahat hi aate hai
 This in fact makes it connected to the minorities settled within India, even though this bill is largely related to the minorities settled outside India
 CAB kaa mul hi yah prathit hota he ki hinduon ke vipareet bharat muslimon kaa prakritik ghar nahin he
 It is a hidden message that the Muslims who chose India over Pakistan will be tolerated, but it is not their country
 deshvyapee NRC ke amit shah ke vaade se bhi isi bhaavana ko bal miltaa he
 This creates fear among Indian Muslims, whether imaginary or real, that they will be denied through the NRC, and their citizenship will be taken away
 duusari taraf, jo hindu kisi vajah se NRC kii chapet main aa jaaenge, unke paas dharmik atyaachaar kaa shikaar hone kaa daawa kar naagarikta ko phir hasil karne kaa vikalp bana rahegaa
 But Muslims will not have such an option
 purvottar rajyon main aabaadi kaa ek bada hissaa maanata he ki CAB darasal bangladeshi hinduon kii unke rajya main maujuudagi ko kanoonee jama pehanaane kii chaal he, khaastaur se unhen, jo assam main chalaae gaye NRC ke pehle daur kii chapet main aa chuke hai
 This is why the Northeast is burning

 According to Banjara, all the encounters he did were within the scope of the law

 People often adopt a variety of prescriptions to reduce obesity, but there is no slight reduction in weight
 iske treetment par log pani kii tarah paisa baha dete hai, jabaki ise ro kar bhi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 It may sound a little strange to hear, but a research has revealed that crying causes a drop in human weight
 asian van main prakashit ek report ke mutabik rone se hamaare sharir main cortisone naamak hormone relies hota he
 Increasing the level of this hormone in the body leads to a drop in weight
 doosraa, stress level badhane par jab ham rote hai to aansuon ke jariye ek vishaiylla padaarth sharir se baahar aata he jo vajan badhane ke liye kaaphi had tak jimmedaar hota he
 The study also revealed that for those who do not easily shed tears on crying, weight loss is a very difficult challenge
 ek or dilachasp baat ye bhi bataai gai he ki rone kii nautanki karne hai yaa dhong rachane se iskaa vajan par koi asar nahin hota
 Research has shown that there are only three types of tears, basal, reflex and psychic
 basal aansu aksar khushi kii vajah se nikalate hai, jabaki riflex aansuon kii vajah cigarette kaa dhuaan yaa pradooshan ho saktaa he
 Emotional tears are the cause of emotion and the loss of weight is due to these
 7 se 10 baje raat main rone se vajan zyada teji se girtaa he
 This is a time when a person's negative emotions dominate him the most
 yah baat pehle bhi saamne aa chuki he ki rone se insaan ke sharir main maujuud calories zyada teji se bern hoti he

 brazil main samaan ling ke koi do vyaktiyon kii shaadi kaa yah pehla mauka he
 Have the stars of Indian cricket, who once made a splash in the field, have come into the role of becoming mentors of this game? No! Rather, they are acting in such a way as a real-life TV show adept and a celebrity always ready to fight
 is realty sho main sabase pehla naam he us shaks kaa, jiske khel ne use bhagwaan kaa darja dilaayaa
 But in his book, he hurt his stature as high as the sky by blowing mud on Greg Chappell
 nishane par aae greg chapel bhartiya khilaadiyon ke pehle se kaaphi naapsand kiye jane vaale coach rahe hai or jab sachin ne un par hamalaa bolaa, to unhone jawaab diya ki captaini ke mudde par kabhi unki koi baat hi nahin hui
 The name of the next player involved in this show is Sourav Ganguly, who used to take off the t-shirt and waved
 greg unke puraane dushman he or sachin kii kitaab ne unhen badla lene kaa nayaa mauka de diya he
 In this show, if anyone is showing a sensible man, it is Rahul Dravid
 jentalman cricket kaa yah jentalman vaaki apane sir main gajab kii thandak liye ghumta he
 But he is also said to be upset with Ganguly's point in which he said that Dravid was relaxed after going through the extent of the chapel
 aglaa naam he harbhajan singh, jo hameshaa se sachin ke daaen haath maane jate hai
 Bhajji, who considers Chappell as his enemy number one, is quite happy with Sachin's book and claims that he also knows about Chappell's mail sent to the BCCI in which Ganguly was misbehaved
 vivies lakshmana ke bathroom main greg chapel kaa poster hua karata tha, lekin jab wo asaliyat main unki jindagi main aae, to kahani badal gai
 This relationship did not go on, as Greg tampered with Laxman's order
 or ab greg unki najar main bhi ek villen hai aam taur par vivaadon se khud ko dur rakhane vaale tej gendbaaj jahir khan bhi is maamle main peeche nahin rahe
 He also said everything he could say by blowing up the Puron issues
 hamaara maananaa he ki cricket ke khilaadiyon ko sari baaten balle yaa gend se kehani chahie
 Especially old controversies should not arise when you have made a distance from the field
 or agar sachin samet tamaam khilaadiyon ko greg se itani pareshaani thi, to us vakt saamne kyon nahin rakhi gai, jab yah sara maamla chal rahaa tha
 It would have been more positive and constructive for both cricket and the team

 " gujarat par rahul gandhi ke bayaan or musharraf va hafiz said par bayaan ko lekar kendriya mantri giriraaj singh se ajtak kii team ne khaas baatcheet kii
 When questioned on the 22 years of functioning of the Gujarat government by Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Giriraj Singh says what Rahul Gandhi will say
 rahul gandhi rani ke kokh se paidaa hue hai
 They don't even know anything
 nehru khandaan ne 60 saal tak raaj kiya
 From Jeep scam to 2G scam, many scams were done
 desh ko bechney kaa kaam kiya
 Unable to eradicate the poverty of Amethi, Rahul Giriraj Singh said that the faces of the rest of the Nehru family became red, born of Rani's womb and he also became a leader
 amethi ne unhen lagaataar saansad chunaa, lekin rahul ne amethi main kitna kaam? uskaa hisaab den
 Rahul could not eradicate the poverty of Amethi nor change his appearance
 upie sarkaar ke dauraanrahul gandhi kalavati ke ghar raat bitaakar unki garibi to dekhi, par kisi bhi kalavati kii garibi mitaa nahin paae
 What Rahul Gandhi will say
 60 saal main nehru khandaan ke chehre to laal ho gaye, lekin desh vahiin kaa vahiin rah gaya
 The country became poor
 rahul kaa mandir janaa, cinema main nautanki karne jaisaamandiron memrahul gandhike jane par giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki puraa desh dekh rahaa he
 When it comes to conversion, their tongue stops
 jab hinduon par atyaachaar hota he, to unki jubaan band ho jaati he
 When it comes to love jihad, their tongue stops
 aaj vah vot ke liye cinema main jaise nautanki karte hai, vah bhi nautanki kar rahe hai
 The doors of all the temples of the country are open for Rahul Gandhi
 lekin desh kii janata dekh rahi he
 Saath Giriraj Singh, who came to build the Ram temple, said that if Rahul Gandhi has the courage, then his father opened the door of the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 ram mandir banavaane main main BJP sarkaar ke saath hum
 Go one step further, we are with you, build a temple in Ayodhya
 hafiz said par bayaan durbhagyapurnaparvej musharraf ke hafiz said ke saath sambandhon par die bayaan par giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki yah durbhagyapurna he
 The whole world is troubled by terrorism today
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf pradhanmantri desh ko ekajute kar rahe hai
 Pakistan is my neighbor
 puri duniya vikaas ke raste par ja rahi he
 He is cultivating terror on the path of destruction
 yah baat to samaj main aati he
 His government of Pakistan is keeping Hafiz Saeed as a son-in-law
 musharraf bhi us mode main lag gaye hai
 He is being hugged to show his close proximity to Lashkar
 aap hi sahi mere rahanuma hai
 Saying this lekin mujhe dukh tab hota he, jab bharat ke yuvaraj jab cinema kaa dialog bolte bolte hafiz said kaa tarif kyon karne lagate hai
 i do not understand why Parrahul Gandhi is happy
 faruk abdulla kii bhashaa bolne lagate hai
 It does not make sense
 bharat taiyaar he
 What is a Hafiz Saeed, a thousand Hafiz Saeed will be born
 bharat kii sarkaar usase mukaable ke liye taiyaar he
 The BJP took a jibe at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday and said that he himself does not contest elections and scares others
 bhaajapa ne singh se kaha ki vah purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisaa saahas dikhaaen jinhone bhrashtachar ke aage jhukne kii bajaay chunaav main janaa pasand kiya tha
 Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain alleged that Singh was allowing corruption to take place in the name of coalition religion and was making odd arguments that elections would be held every six months if coalition religion was not taken care of
 unhone sawaal kiya, kya gathbandhan dharm yaa jaldi jaldi chunaav hone ke tark par bhrashtachar hone diya jaae
 He himself does not contest elections and is scaring others with elections
 shahanvaj ne kaha, pradhanmantri har chah maheene main chunaav hone se kisi ko nahin daraayein or yah bataaen ki unke gathbandhan dharm main bhrashtachar kii kya majaburi he
 He said, Singh should not follow coalition religion but Rajdharma and corruption should not be allowed to follow any logic
 har chah maheene par chunaav karaane kii pradhanmantri kii dhamkee par unhone kaha ki ek baar chunaav karake dekh lijie, sari galatfahami dur ho jaaegi
 Due to corruption and price rise, the people will give the mandate to the competent people to form the government instead of the UPA and there will be no need for elections every six months
 unhone kaha ki gujarat, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh or jharkhand ke haal ke up-chunaavon main bhaajapa kii baari jeet ne janata ke rujhaan ko saaf kar diya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had preferred to go to the polls in 1999 instead of bowing to corruption and Singh should also show such courage
 agar aap kahin aane-jane kaa plan bana rahe hai to yah khabar aapako jarur khush kar degi
