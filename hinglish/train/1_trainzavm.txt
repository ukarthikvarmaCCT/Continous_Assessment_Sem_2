 aadhunik yug main insaan kaa dimag pehle se zyada vyast ho gaya he
 We try to do many things together like email, Facebook, messaging
 multi tasking hamaare dimag kii shakti par asar daal rahi he
 Multitasking addiction is reducing the efficiency of human work
 neuroscientist dainiel Levitin namchin visheshgy he, jinhone study ke baad paaya he ki zyaadaatar logon main bhuulane kii aadat or kaarykushalta main kami multitasking ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Today, people are constantly focusing on multitasking as compared to the old times
 log sochate hai ki ve ek saath kai kaam kar rahe hai
 From the list of household items to email, talk to friends, use mobile continuously on the way
 lekin kya kabhi hamane sochaa he ki isse mastishk prabhavit ho rahaa he, jisase kushalta main kami aa rahi he
 According to Daniel Levitin, if a message is left unread in someone's inbox, they lose their 9 point IQ thinking that
 duusari ore, puraane jamaane main wireles phone nahin hote the, to kisi meeting yaa kaam ke dauraan yah pataa hi nahin hota tha ki kab phone kii ghanti bajkar band ho gai
 But today it is not so
 multitasking bilkul ek jaadugar kii gend kii tarah hoti he
 One is in the hand and one is in the air
 pataa nahin ki kab neeche gir jaae
 In the same way, multitasking makes the mind tired
 kisi kaam ko karne main jitani urja kii jarurat hoti he, multitasking se glucose kii maatra jaldi kam ho jaati he or pataa bhi nahin lagata shakti or kushalta kam ho gai

 But what happened on the next ball of the same over from Malinga in the final of IPL8 can also become a topic of discussion in the coming days

 maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ne pichley kuch dinon se maharashtra kii hi aashaa bhonsle ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he or de di he chetavanee ki aashaa bhonsle agar pakistani kalakaaron ke saath sur kaa manch saajha karti hai to ye unhen bardaasht nahin
 But now a name has been added to this struggle waged through sur
 uddhav thakare, shivasena ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or raaj thakare ke chachere bhai kaa
 Raj made the first move in this game by making the pawn of Pakistani artists, but Uddhav is now trying to checkmate Raj by saying that the opposition of Pakistani artists has already been on Shiv Sena's agenda
 aashaa bhonsle ke virodh ke maamle main bhi uddhav thakare ne raaj thakare par nishaanaa saadhaa ki virodh sirf aashaa tai kaa hi kyon
 In the talks, when Uddhav was asked if a new electoral alliance with MNS in Maharashtra would come out in the 2014 elections, he neither denied it nor agreed to it
 shivasena shuru se pakistan or bharat ke bich cricket maichon kaa virodh karti ai he lekin is baar suniye kya he isaki vajah
 Uddhav spoke candidly to Aaj Tak on many other issues
 baatcheet main yahi nikalakar saamne aayaa ki shivasena kisi bhi tareeke se ye hajam nahin kar paa rahi he ki unke puraane muddon ko koi or party hijank karke kaise apana bana sakati he
 Then even if he is Raj Thackeray
 saal 2013-14 kaa aam bajet vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne bhale hi sansad main pesh kiya he lekin ise lekar bihar kii raajnneeti garam hone lagi he
 The Chief Minister has not only praised this budget, but has even congratulated the Finance Minister
 duusari ore rajya ke up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bajet ko niraashajanak qaraar diya he
 Politicians are watching this by connecting it to future politics
 kendriya bajet main bihar ke aam logon ke liye koi vishesh phaayde kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he, lekin kendriya vittamantri ne vishesh rajya ke darje ke maapdand main parivartan karne kaa prastaav dekar mukhyamantri nitish kaa dil avashya jeet liya he
 Nitish says that the budget speech and the Economic Survey have talked about a change in the current criteria for special state status, which proves that Bihar has been accepted in principle
 yah puure bihar ke logon kii saidhantik jeet he
 Chidambaram deserves congratulations for this
 nitish kumaar ne aashaa vyakt kii he ki is ghoshnaa ko jald hi amalijama bhi pahanaaya jayega
 Nitish, however, denied Chidambaram's appreciation of the political equation and said that it should not make any political sense
 yah ghoshnaa bihar jaise pichde rajyon ke vikaas kaa rasta kholane vaala he
 Here, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance of Bihar (NDA) and Sushil Kumar Modi, the deputy chief minister of the state, called the budget disappointing
 ve kehete hai ki hamen is bajet se keval or sirf niraashaa hi haath lagi he
 With this budget, Bihar will face a lot of difficulties because now many problems have arisen in the budget of Bihar
 unhone kaha ki bihar ke vikaas ke liye or adhik bajet kii jarurat thi
 There is a very rare occasion in the politics of the state or the politics of the country, when the statement of the Deputy Chief Minister has appeared opposite from the Chief Minister's statement
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar bhi kehete hai ki jab bhi bijepi ke kisi netaa ne mukhyamantri ke bayaan ke khilaaf koi tippanee kar kii he to us khai ko bhi modi ne paatane kii koshish kii he
 In such a situation, Modi's statement means many things
 congress or mukhyamantri donon jaanate hai ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja milanaa aasaan nahin he
 Today, no opposition leader except Nitish has praised the budget
 is mudde ko lekar nitish or congress donon raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The Congress heats up the issue by giving Nitish a mid-shot
 yah mudda bihar kii raajnneeti main agaami samay main gaharaa asar daal saktaa he
 Janata Party President Subrahmanyam Swamy asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to keep former Telecom Minister a Raja under top class security
 pradhanmantri singh ko bheje gaye patr main swami ne kaha ki raja ko aalaa darje kii suraksha main rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki kuch log unhen hameshaa ke liye ‘shant’ karnaa chaahate hai
 He said that the king has important information about some people in power
 bengal chunaav surveykshakon (pollsters) ke liye bure sapane se kam nahin to vahiin gujarat unke kaam ke liye sabase aasaan rajya he
 This is to say Pradeep Gupta, the leading surveyor of Axis My India
 gupta ne ye tippanee tab kii jab unase 2019 aam chunaav ke liye bharat ke logon ke man kii thaah lene ke liye kii gai sabase badi kavayad ke bare main poocha gaya
 As the last phase of voting ends on May 19, India Today TV will start showing the figures of the Axis My India Post Poll survey
 542 nirvachan kshetron main 7 lakh se adhik pratibhaagiyon kaa survey kiye jane ke peeche kitni mehnat kii gai hogi, iskaa andaaz hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Gupta told India Today that the survey of participants in India's diverse states was a big challenge
 mushkilon kaa str rajya dar rajya kitna tha, iskaa akalan kai paimaanon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 In the shadow of fear, Gupta said that this time in Bengal it was very difficult to survey and here the challenge of survey was more difficult than 2014
 iskaa kaaran unhone kanoon or vyavastha se jude muddon ko bataaya
 Gupta said, "when we try and talk to people, they would react with excesses and look at us with suspicion
 unki soch is tarah kii lagati jaise ki wo maanate ho ki hamen bijepi yaa congress ne bheja he kyonki vahaan trinmul congress sattarudh party he
 According to Gupta, he met the 'silent voter' in Bengal
 gupta ne bataaya ki ye voter wo nahin jisaki media baat karata he
 Gupta says that in the media terminology, the voter to whom the media cannot reach is a 'silent voter'
 gupta ne kaha, “bengal main ye fier-factor (dar kii ashanka) tha jise hamane apane antim vishleshan main shaamil kiya
 People are not telling their political choices
 kisi khaas party ke vafaadaar log maun rahanaa pasand kar rahe hai kyonki unhen dar he ki ‘duusare’ unhen peetenge
 "gupta said," It is interesting that BJP voters everywhere seem very excited to share their political choices everywhere in Bengal
 jabaki bengal main iskaa ulataa dikhaa
 Those who voted for Trinamool were outspoken here
 lekin gaiyr tiemasi partiyon ke votaron ne maun rahanaa hi pasand kiya
 However, Axis My India managed to reach out to voters who were looking for surveyors in front of whom they could express their political preference
 bhugolic baadhaenmushkilon ke str kii baat kii jaae to bhugolic baadhaon kii drushti se karnataka or madhya pradesh ke naam sabase upar aate hai
 Says Gupta, "madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are big states; it takes longer to reach from one place to another
 ”purvottar, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand or jammu-kashmir jaise pavarvateey rajya yatra ke hisaab se kathin hai
 Says Gupta, "under normal conditions it usually takes 25-30 minutes to cover an area of 20 kilometers
 lekin parvatiy rajyon main yahi samay do ghante ho jaataa he
 "if we talk about local human resources then Kerala and Odisha are also very difficult for election surveyors
 gupta kehete hai, “ye ahm he ki aap ke paas aise log hon jo naa sirf sthaneey bhashaa ko samajhate hon balki aanchalik boli main sthaneey pratibhaagiyon se aasaani se baatcheet kar saken
 In such a situation, the participants are able to join us and are ready to tell the facts
 agar is par dhyaan naa diya jaae to kerala or odisha main kaam kar paanaa naammumkin he
 "when the election is spread over so many phases in the heat of the weather, how can the weather difficulties be ignored?" gupta ke mutabik is maamle main sabase vikat sthiti vaala rajya uttar pradesh he
 Gupta, when asked which is the easiest state to survey, quickly took the name of 'gujarat'
 gupta ne kaha, “vahaan sampark karnaa aasaan he, bhugolic yaa prashasnic baadhaaen nahin hai
 People are more helpful
 wo saral hai isliye baat karne se manaa nahin karte hai
 However, Gupta also added that it is difficult to talk to women in Gujarat
 canavarzan darkanvarzan dar ke kya myne? iske myne ye he ki kisi surveykshak ko apni study ke tahat har das daravaajon par jane par kitni sakaaratmak pratikriyaayein milti hai
 In metro cities where conversion rate remains 6 out of 10, in rural areas it is 8 out of 10
 lekin gujarat is maamle main alag dikhaa 
 The area here is urban or rural conversion rate is 8-9 out of 10
 exis maai india ne madhya pradesh ko survey ke lihaaz se acha rajya bataaya
 Gupta said, "there is no such thing as fear among the participants in Madhya Pradesh
" udhaaharan ke liye madhya pradesh main bhi dar kaa factor dikhaa kyon vahaan chaar ahm partiyaan hai, do rashtriya or do kshetreey dal
 Participants always think that another party has sent
 isliye wo apni raajnneetik pasand bataane main hichakate hai
 Equations of caste and religion When the caste and religious equations are also taken into consideration at the ground level, the survey process becomes challenging
 gupta kehete hai, “agar aap hindu hai or kisi muslim kaa survey kar rahe hai to wo aapako duusare nazariye se dekhegaa
 Similarly, if a Muslim talks to a Brahmin participant, then that participant will talk in a different way
 ”aakhir main agrani surveykshak gupta ne NOTA ko lekar ahm tippanee kii
 Gupta said, "NOTA will factor in this election
 2014 main 60 lakh logon ne NOTA par batan dabaaya tha, is baar ye sankhya zyaada ho sakati he

 supreme court main somvaar ko mudgal samiti kii report par sunwaayee hui, lekin court ne shuukravaar tak ke liye faisla taal diya he
 In fact, on 3 November, the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee, investigating the IPL spot fixing and 13 people, submitted their report to the Supreme Court
 court report ko padhakar is cese kii karrwai ko aage badhayegi
 The entire BCCI, including N
 Srinivasan, is waiting to reveal what is in this report
 shrinivasana ke khilaaf agar koi saboot nahin mila to unki board main vaapasi ho sakati he jabaki saboot milane kii surat main board main kai badlaav hone tay he
 At the same time, it is also interesting to know what is in the report about Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of N
 Srinivasan, because it is through him that the future of Chennai Super Kings will be decided in the IPL
 ipel ke niyamon ke mutabik, agar kisi bhi team se judaa adhikari agar galat harkaton main lipt paaya jaataa he, jisase khel or toornament kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunche to fouran us frenchizi ko barkhaast kiya janaa chahie

 shrinivasana ke kilaaf panel ko koi thos saboot nahin mila he
 Nor has there been any evidence that he was aware of Meiyappan's betting
 isliye unhen 20 november ko board kaa chunaav ladane se nahin roka ja saktaa
 However, this newspaper claims that the Mudgal panel has held Gurunath Meiyappan guilty in its investigation

 In the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted the opposition who created an uproar during the winter session over demonetisation
 satr ke aakhri din piem modi ne sadan shuru hone se pehle sansadeey dal kii baithak bulaai jisamen unhone congress samet puure vipaksh ko aade haathon liya
 Learn why the party is bigger than the country for the opposition and what Chanakya had said
 1
 Demonetisation was needed in 1971, which we have done today
 2
 Demonetisation work for the elections was then stopped
 3
 Indiraji's Finance Minister was saying that it was necessary but it was not done then
 4
 If this had happened then the country would not have been ruined today
 5
 The Communist Party is uprooted from its ideology
 6
 Opposition has gathered in support of corruption
 7
 Why have you not implemented the benami property law since 88? 8
 And now when we are implementing, we are screaming at us
 9
 The Chanakya Policy states that money earned from injustice lasts only ten years
 11 varsh lagane ke baad wo khud hi khatm ho jaataa he
 10
 ham is desh ko kaala dhan se mukt banaaenge
 Therefore, for the opposition, there is a bigger party than the country and for us there is a bigger country than the party

 The bjp's IT cell team from the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Public Relations Office is busy preparing new ideas for the party on social media
 saath hi gathbandhan or bispi ke khilaaf prachaar karne ke liethos ranneeti par kaam chal rahaa he
 The suggestions coming from the public on social media are sent to the top leaders of the party
 soshal media report ke aadhaar par varanasi main bijepi ke kshetreey karyaalay se hi amit shah or unki team aage kii ranneeti ko antim rup detii he
 It is decided from here that which leaders will rally in which assembly constituency

 In the Bihar Assembly elections, the BJP had contested on the face of PM Modi and Amit Shah, keeping behind its local leadership, and what the results were in front of them
 bijepi ne ek ranneeti taiyaar kii he jiske mutabik centre sarkaar mempurvanchal se jitne bhi mantri heunase har din press conference karai jaaegi
 Manoj Sinha, Kalraj Mishra, Anupriya Patel, Mahendra Nath Pandey, Yogi Adityanath are being contested by BJP in the constituencies
 har roj lagbhag ek darjan mantri land kar raheupi vidhansabha chunaav main antim do charan ke liye bijepi kaa main hub centre varanasi ban gaya he isliye kendriya mantri jepi nadda or piyush goyal, manoj sinha , anupriya patel or mahendra nath pandeya ne pichley 20 din se varanasi ko hi apana kaaryakshetra bana liya he
 Every day around a dozen ministers land in Varanasi

 matlab saaf he ki bijepi kisi bhi keemat par varanasi kshetra main kamjor nahin dikhnaa chaahati he kyunki agar yadi koi chook hui to uskaa thikra party par nahin piem modi par phutegaa
 This is because Union Ministers Anant Kumar, Radhamohan Singh, Kalraj Mishra and Ram Kripal Yadav have also taken charge for the last two weeks for 49 seats in 7 districts of the sixth phase
 varanasi main modi sarkaar ke mantri badi sankhya main isliye bhi aa rahe hai kyonki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa loksabhaa kshetra he

 The record set by the elected representatives in different states of the country to increase their salary should inspire the great public to do something that their salary, which was once called Darmaha and salary, should increase by more than 100 percent

 Suppose your salary is 10,000 for the month, if it increases to 26000 from April, then you will jump for joy or not
 lekin aap chupchaap dekhiye kyonki aapke kudane kii baari abhi nahin ai he
 Now the salary of mlas has increased from 95,000 to 2
5 lakhs
 mantriyon kii selary 2 lakh 40 hazaar se badhkar 4 lakh ho gai he
 In this regard, a bill was introduced in the assembly on Monday and it passed without opposition
 prastaav to saadhe teen lakh prati maah karne kaa tha lekin vidhayakon kii samvedansheeltaa dekhiye, dhai lakh hi badhaayaa
 That too unanimously
 telugana ek navdith rajya he
 The loan is only 61000 crores but this does not mean that its millionaire mlas cannot take a salary of 2
5 lakhs
 aap jaanate hai ki april 2014 main telugana main pehla chunaav hua or 119 vidhayak chun kar aae
 The Association for Democratic Reform found that out of 119, only 83 mlas were found to be millionaires
 6 vidhayak aise hai jinaki chal achal sampatti 30 karod se zyaada he, 36 vidhayak gair karodpati hai
 There are 3 mlas whose assets are less than 18 lakhs
 in teenon main se ek kii sampatti maatr 1 lakh 82 hazaar kii chal sampatti he
 Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao has told the media to understand the situation
 baaki media kaa to main nahin jaanata lekin main unki apil ke baad se samaj gaya hum
 Just then i am explaining to you that it would be nice if the salary of 83 crorepati mlas is not even Rs lakh
 inamen se ek vidhayak kii chal achal sampatti to 111 karod se adhik he
 Tell them that they would not be able to tell anyone that there is 95,000 salary
 ham log sirf garibon kii takaleef samajhate hai lekin hamen amiron kii jhijak bhi samajni chahie
 If you think from this angle, you will also be able to join the happiness of increasing the salary of mlas
 mananeey mukhyamantri ne selary badhane ke kaarnon ko vistaar se bataaya he jise deccan chronical akhbaar ne chapa he
 i appeal to you audience that please understand the pain of legislators
 jo mukhyamantri kah rahe hai wo suniye
 He said, thirty years ago, when i became an MLA, the salary was only 500 rupees per month, but now the economic scenario has changed
 vidhayakon kaa selary bhatta bill rajya ke ek lakh karod ke bajet ke aage to bahut maamuli he
 a legislator is a member of 30 committees, he has to attend their meetings

 suraksha karmchaaree ke khaane kaa kharchaa bhi nikaalnaa hota he
 So from now on, there is an appeal to the security personnel of the mlas to eat it hard because the salary of Manyavar ji has increased
 lekin jo mukhyamantri ne kaha kya wo galat he
 Probably not
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidhayakon ko mandir or tyoharon ke vakt chande dene padate hai
 This is a big problem
 aaj kal kai vidhayak bataate hai ki gaanv-gaanv main cricket pratiyogita hone lagi he or iske liye chanda maang maang kar yuvakon ne pareshaan kar diya he
 Do we think even once that donating money is not the job of MLA
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jinke upar raashtra nirmaan kii zimmedaari he unhen acchhee selary milani chahie
 The question arises when the people engaged in nation building are not taken care of so promptly

 As legislators grow
 kya sabhi vidhayakon kaa pradarshan ek samaan hota he
 Last year, there was a lot of uproar when the Delhi government increased the salary of its mlas by 400 percent
 88,000 se badhaakar 2 lakh rupee prati maah kar di gai
 The bill is pending with the central government and is yet to be approved, meaning Delhi legislators are not getting the increased salary
 tab bijepi ke vidhayakon ne bhavavesh main kah diya ki ve janaseva ke liye aae hai or ek rupee kii selary par kaam karenge
 Now when we get the approval from the Center, only then will we know whether these mlas will work for one rupee or take full salary
 telugana ke vidhayakon kii selary dilli se bhi zyada he
 Similarly, on Tuesday, the Madhya Pradesh cabinet has decided to increase the salary of mlas

 ek report ke anusaar puure desh main telugana ke vidhayakon kii selary sabase adhik he
 We should consider the matter of salary of mlas with reasonableness
 unhen vidhayaki ke kaam ke liye sansaadhan kii zarurat to he lekin kya sabhi vidhayakon kaa pradarshan ek sa hota he
 Legislators' houses are crowded by ordinary people or activists
 unki drawing room main kiski pahunch hoti he ye wo bhi jaanate hai or aap bhi jaanate hai
 Salaries also increase in companies, but they do not grow according to 160 percent and do not grow equally
 26 november 2015 ke din enditivi proffit kii site par khabar lagi he ki 2016 ke saal main bhartiya companiyon main vetan 10
 Will increase only 8 percent
 agar aap 6
 If we calculate the inflation rate of 1 percent, then this increase is 4
 7 pratishat kii hogi
 The legislator is fine
 apni selary sau dedh sau pratishat badha lete hai isamen mudrasphiti kii 5-6 pratishat kahaan gum ho jaati hogi kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalata hoga
 It is obvious that our farmers are longing for better prices, they come in debt but it never grows
 sarkari karmchaariyon kaa mahangaai bhatta samay se badhata rahata he
 The Seventh Pay Commission is coming
 hamaare vidhayakon kii selary kitni badhani chahie, badhane kaa aadhaar kya hona chahie, kyon nahin badhani chahie or badhani kyon chahie
 If you want many answers, then watch prime time
 dakkan ke navdith praant telugana ke garib vidhayakon kii selary or suvidha main 160 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Suppose your salary is 10,000 for the month, if it increases to 26000 from April, then you will jump for joy or not
 lekin aap chupchaap dekhiye kyonki aapke kudane kii baari abhi nahin ai he
 Now the salary of mlas has increased from 95,000 to 2
5 lakhs
 mantriyon kii selary 2 lakh 40 hazaar se badhkar 4 lakh ho gai he
 In this regard, a bill was introduced in the assembly on Monday and it passed without opposition
 prastaav to saadhe teen lakh prati maah karne kaa tha lekin vidhayakon kii samvedansheeltaa dekhiye, dhai lakh hi badhaayaa
 That too unanimously
 telugana ek navdith rajya he
 The loan is only 61000 crores but this does not mean that its millionaire mlas cannot take a salary of 2
5 lakhs
 aap jaanate hai ki april 2014 main telugana main pehla chunaav hua or 119 vidhayak chun kar aae
 The Association for Democratic Reform found that out of 119, only 83 mlas were found to be millionaires
 6 vidhayak aise hai jinaki chal achal sampatti 30 karod se zyaada he, 36 vidhayak gair karodpati hai
 There are 3 mlas whose assets are less than 18 lakhs
 in teenon main se ek kii sampatti maatr 1 lakh 82 hazaar kii chal sampatti he
 Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao has told the media to understand the situation
 baaki media kaa to main nahin jaanata lekin main unki apil ke baad se samaj gaya hum
 Just then i am explaining to you that it would be nice if the salary of 83 crorepati mlas is not even Rs lakh
 inamen se ek vidhayak kii chal achal sampatti to 111 karod se adhik he
 Tell them that they would not be able to tell anyone that there is 95,000 salary
 ham log sirf garibon kii takaleef samajhate hai lekin hamen amiron kii jhijak bhi samajni chahie
 If you think from this angle, you will also be able to join the happiness of increasing the salary of mlas

 jo mukhyamantri kah rahe hai wo suniye
 He said, thirty years ago, when i became an MLA, the salary was only 500 rupees per month, but now the economic scenario has changed
 vidhayakon kaa selary bhatta bill rajya ke ek lakh karod ke bajet ke aage to bahut maamuli he
 a legislator is a member of 30 committees, he has to attend their meetings

 Have to hire a driver and personal staff
 suraksha karmchaaree ke khaane kaa kharchaa bhi nikaalnaa hota he
 So from now on, there is an appeal to the security personnel of the mlas to eat it hard because the salary of Manyavar ji has increased
 lekin jo mukhyamantri ne kaha kya wo galat he
 Probably not
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidhayakon ko mandir or tyoharon ke vakt chande dene padate hai
 This is a big problem

 Last year, there was a lot of uproar when the Delhi government increased the salary of its mlas by 400 percent
 88,000 se badhaakar 2 lakh rupee prati maah kar di gai
 This bill is pending with the central government and is yet to be approved, meaning Delhi legislators are not getting the increased salary
 tab bijepi ke vidhayakon ne bhavavesh main kah diya ki ve janaseva ke liye aae hai or ek rupee kii selary par kaam karenge
 Now when we get the approval from the Center, only then will we know whether these mlas will work for one rupee or take full salary
 telugana ke vidhayakon kii selary dilli se bhi zyada he
 Similarly, on Tuesday, the Madhya Pradesh cabinet has decided to increase the salary of mlas
 71,000 prati maah se badhaakar 1 lakh 10 hazaar karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 It is proposed to increase the salary of the ministers to 1 lakh seventy thousand

 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ne media se kaha he ki ve sthiti ko samajhe
 i do not know the rest of the media but i have understood since his appeal
 tabhi aapako samajha rahaa hum ki kya acha lagegaa ki 83 karodpati vidhayakon kii selary lakh rupee bhi na ho
 One of these mla's movable immovable property is more than 111 crores
 bataaiye wo kisi ko laaj ke maare kah nahin pate honge ki 95,000 selary he
 We only understand the suffering of the poor, but we should also understand the hesitation of the rich
 is angel se sochenge to aap bhi vidhayakon kii selary badhane kii khushi main shaamil ho paayenge
 The honorable Chief Minister has explained in detail the reasons for increasing salary, which has been published by Deccan Chronicle newspaper
 main aap darshakon se apil karata hum ki pleez vidhayakon ke dard ko bhi samajhiye
 Listen to what the Chief Minister is saying
 unhone kaha, tees saal pehle jab main vidhayak bana to 500 rupee prati maah hi selary thi, lekin ab aarthik paridrishy badal gaya he
 The salary allowance bill of the mlas is very modest, ahead of the state's one lakh crore budget
 ek vidhayak 30 cametiyon kaa sadsy hota he, use inaki baithkon main janaa hota he District council meetings have to go, everyday hundred and fifty people come to work, who have to drink tea, otherwise people get angry
 driver or nijee staff rakhana padataa he
 Food expenses of security personnel also have to be spent
 to ab se vidhayakon ke suraksha karmiyon se apil hai ki ve jam kar khaayen kyonki manyavar ji kii tankhwaah bad gai he
 But what the Chief Minister said is wrong
 shaayad nahin
 He also said that mlas have to pay donations during temples and festivals
 ye bahut badi samasya he
 Nowadays, many mlas say that cricket competition is going on in every village and the youth has harassed them by asking for donations
 kya ham ek baar bhi sochate hai ki chanda dena vidhayak kaa kaam nahin he
 The Chief Minister said that those who have the responsibility of nation building should get good salary
 sawaal to tab uthta he jab raashtra nirmaan main hi lage dusron logon kaa itani tatparta se khyaal nahin rakhaa jaataa
 The state of Telangana was born as the 29th state of India in May 2014, since then 2100 farmers have committed suicide
 sirf 400 pariwaron ko hi muawza mila he
 You know about a company where everyone's salary rises at a rate
 jaise vidhayakon kii badhati he
 Do all mlas have the same performance
 pichley saal dilli sarkaar ne apane vidhayakon kii selary 400 pratishat badha di to kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 Increased from 88,000 to 2 lakh rupees per month
 yah bill centre sarkaar ke paas lambit he or abhi tak manzuri nahin mili he arthath dilli ke vidhayakon ko badi hui selary nahin mil rahi he
 Then the BJP mlas said in the mood that they had come for public service and would work on a salary of one rupee
 ab jab centre se manzuri mil jaaegi tabhi pataa chalegaa ki ye vidhayak ek rupee main kaam karenge yaa puri selary lenge
 The salary of Telangana mlas is more than Delhi
 isi tarah mangalvaar ko madhyapradesh cabinet ne vidhayakon kii selary badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 It has been proposed to increase from 71,000 per month to 1 lakh 10 thousand
 mantriyon kaa vetan 1 lakh sattar hazaar karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 The salary of the Chief Minister has been increased from 1 lakh 43 thousand to 2 lakh per month
 isamen vetan or bhatta sabhi shaamil hai
 For the fourth time in 9 years, the salary of mlas has increased
 andhra pradesh vidhansabha main bhi mangalvaar yani 30 march ko vidhayakon kaa vetan bhatta vidheyak paas kiya gaya he
 Now the salary of mlas will increase from 95,000 to 1 lakh 25 thousand
 awasaiya bhatta 25,000 se badhaakar 50,000 kar diya gaya he
 Railway coupons ranging from 98,000 to 1 lakh will be given
 patrika or kitabon ke liye 20,000 rupaya milegaa The allowance for the assembly constituency will be 1 lakh 38 thousand which was earlier 83,000 rupees
 tippaniyan The legislators of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh have started celebrating Diwali even after Holi
 mangalvaar ko hi chhattisgarh sarkaar kii cabinet ke faisle ke anusaar vidhayakon kii selary 75,000 se badhaakar 1 lakh das hazaar prati maah kar di gai he
 According to a report, the salary of Telangana mlas is the highest in the entire country
 hamen vidhayakon kii selary ke maamle ko taarkikta ke saath dekhnaa chahie
 They need resources for legislative work, but do all legislators have the same performance
 vidhayakon ke ghar aam logon kii bheed hoti he yaa kaaryakartaaon kii
 They also know who has access to their drawing room and you also know
 compinyon main bhi selary badhati he lekin wo 160 pratishat ke hisaab se nahin badhati or sabaki ek samaan nahin badhati he
 On 26 November 2015, NDTV Profit's site reported that in the year of 2016, salary in Indian companies was 10
 8 pratishat hi badhegaa
 If you 1 pratishat kii mudrasphiti dar kaa hisaab laga len to yah vruddhi 4
 7 percent
 vidhayak hi thik he
 If you increase your salary by one hundred and fifty hundred percent, then no one will know where inflation will be lost 5-6 percent
 zaahir he hamaare kisaan behatar mulya ke liye tarasate rahete hai, karje main aa jate hai magar wo kabhi nahin badhata
 Dearness allowance of government employees keeps increasing from time to time
 saatvaan vetan ayog aa hi rahaa he
 How much should the salary of our legislators increase, what should be the basis for increasing, why should it not increase and why should it increase
 bahut saare chahie kaa jawaab chahie to prime time dekhiye
 So from now on, there is an appeal to the security personnel of the mlas to eat it hard because the salary of Manyavar ji has increased
 lekin jo mukhyamantri ne kaha kya wo galat he
 Probably not
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidhayakon ko mandir or tyoharon ke vakt chande dene padate hai
 This is a big problem
 aaj kal kai vidhayak bataate hai ki gaanv-gaanv main cricket pratiyogita hone lagi he or iske liye chanda maang maang kar yuvakon ne pareshaan kar diya he
 Do we think even once that donating money is not the job of MLA
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jinke upar raashtra nirmaan kii zimmedaari he unhen acchhee selary milani chahie
 The question arises when the people engaged in nation building are not taken care of so promptly
 may 2014 main bharat ke 29 wein rajya ke rup main telugana rajya kaa janm hua, tab se ab tak 2100 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he

 The media has been introduced in a very ridiculous manner

 ' nirmit viraasat kii duniya paaramparik rup se visheshgyon ke dakhal kii rahi he jo use soochibaddh or sangrakshit karte hai, uski dekharekh ke saath un smarakon or sthalon kii vyakhya karte hai
 This scope is also increasing its role in public circles
 haalanki iske saath baadhaaen bhi hoti hai or avasar bhi kyonki visheshgyon ke ekadhikaar ko daavedaari jataane vaale baaki log bhi to chunauti denge
 This was evident in a recent event in Delhi
 disambar kii 11 se 15 taarikh tak tamaam visheshgy international council an monuments and cites (isioemoes) kii trivarshik aamasabha kii mejabani ke liye jamaa hue the
 ICOMOS is the world's largest private organization engaged in this work and it also advises UNESCO in the work of preparing the list of world heritage
 is sanghathan kii bharat shakha ko haal hi main phir se sakriy kiya gaya tha or behad kam samay main isane sanghathan kii sabase badi sabha kii mejabani kar lee, jisamen sau se zyada deshon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale hajaar se zyada log shaamil hue
 About 200 presentations were given in four parallel sessions in the meeting
 bhartiya mejabaanon kaa is paricharchaa ke liye chunaa gaya mul vishay tha—viraasat or loktantr
 Perhaps there has been a feeling behind choosing this subject that India has a plurality of both these things
 yakeenan ye aise maamle hai jinamein bharat baaki sau deshon ke saamne puure adhikaar ke saath apni baat rakh saktaa he
 The question is, how do the two things fit together? How can all the people be benefited by preserving the built heritage and can it be done on the basis of equality? Such questions are not useful
 kyonki taj mahal sareekhe e shrenee ke smarak bhi vivaad se pare nahin rah pate hai
 In this context, the Delhi manifesto issued by the representatives of the convention is very important
 ise unesco ke saath-saath sarkaar kaa bhi anumodan hasil ho chukaa he
 The manifesto sees both of these as important components for the mass-based vision of sustainable development
 adarshavaadi sukhyon ke aage gaharaai se dekhen to kai buniyadi mudde saamne aate hai
 The first is to expand the notion of heritage so that it includes not only a monument or a group of buildings but also their configuration and the surrounding landscape
 yah is avadharana se upja he ki viraasat sthalon ke bare main logon kii samaj ek vyapak sandarbh main nihit he or isliye vrihad dharna zyada samaveshi or loktantric he
 It also takes care of people's beliefs and values
 lihaaja ghoshnaptr kaa anumodan karne ke baad sarkaar, ho saktaa he ki sansad main sarvasammati se paarit kiye gaye 2010 ke pracheen smarak or puratathvik sthal (sanshodhan or anumodan) adhinium ke praavdhaanon ko halkaa karne kii uski koshishon par punarvichaar karne lage
 In that act, restricted and regular areas were fixed around the monuments
 uskaa iraadaa darasal viraasat kii isi vistrut hoti avadharana se upja tha jo in sthalon ke bare main logon kii (keval puratatvavidon kii hi nahin) samaj par aadhaarit tha
 But now it has been proposed that these provisions for 'public works' be set aside
 lekin sawaal lajimi he ki ye koun se 'jan' hai jo logon se hi virodh par utaaru najar aate hai?sangrakshan or vikaas ke bich ke puraane aapasi virodh ko kuch abhijatya logon ke junun banaam garibon kii jaruraton ke aadhaar par nahin mapa ja saktaa
 Now it is about the needs of all the people so that they can incorporate the legacy into a sustainable future
 lekin aakhir 'unki' viraasat he kya? ghoshnaptr kii is tippanee kii roshni main ki 'viraasat kaa vidhaayi sangrakshan har str kii sarkaron kii jimmedaari he', bharat sarkaar bhi jaraa thamkar un aakhri panktiyon par vichaar kar sakati he jinamein viraasat kii samaveshi samaj par jor diya gaya he
 'it is our responsibility to preserve the importance of the multicultural, multifaceted heritage that we have inherited from the previous generation and hand it over to future generations
 ''isioemoes kii aam sabha ke udghaatan satr ko sambodhit karne ke liye aamantrit kiye gaye yogi or haal hi main padam bhushan se sammanit sadguru jaggi vasudev thode hairaan-se najar aae
 He humbly admitted that he considered himself a little uneducated in the presence of so many experts
 lekin unhone bhartiya samskruti kii apni pariklpana kaa vivaran pesh kiya, jise na keval sangrakshan kii jarurat thi balki punasrthapit karne kii bhi kyonki 'ham lagbhag hajaar saalon tak dusron ke shashan main rahe'
 Hardly any voice of protest was heard, perhaps due to Jaggi's many public works
 lekin iskaa aashay spasht thah jo yah maanate hai ki koi videshi mul kaa dharm bhartiya nahin ho saktaa, hajaar saal ke baad bhi nahin; or us dharm ke logon ke shashan main jo kuch bhi taiyaar kiya gaya tha, vah bhartiya samskruti kii nishaani nahin he
 That is, according to this, the Indian heritage is not diverse and there is only one true tradition in it which should be told in all possible ways
 bhartiya itihaas ke bare main sadguru kaa drushtikon sunakar haal hi main centre sarkaar kaa ek faisla dhyaan aa gaya
 In it, it refused to support the proposal sent to ICOMOS by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to list Delhi as a World Heritage City
 usne kathith taur par aisa isliye kiya tha kyonki aavedan ke centre main rakhe gaye ilaakon—shahjahanabad or lutiyans bangala jone ko bhartiya samskruti kaa pratinidhi nahin samajha gaya tha
 Obviously, such a statement is no longer considered rare and absurd
 isi tarj par beete saal main hamane uttar pradesh ke ek mantri kaa bhi bayaan suna ki taj mahal darasal bhartiya samskruti kaa udhaaharan nahin he
 The first book survey on Indian art (published in the 1950s) that i read as a student covered the period from the Indus Valley Civilization to the year 1200
 iskaa nishkarsh yah tha ki bhartiya sabhyataa vahiin samaapt ho gai or uske baad uski jagah kisi or ne le lee
 After that book came another book in which Mughal architecture was taken but it too came and stopped after 1750
 sadi ke khatm hote-hote bhartiya shikshavidon ke kai survey saamne aae jinamein aadhunik kala ko shaamil kiya gaya tha or aisa keval isliye nahin kiya gaya tha ki hamaare daur kii kala ko ateet kii kala se jodgaye ke liye anivaarytaaon kii koi kritrim pahchaan kii jaae
 The motive behind this was to celebrate the ever-changing, constantly changing character of Indian art
 saal 2018 ke liye meraa andeshaa yahi he ki saarvajanik rup se hamen nirantar tej hote pratigaami swar or bhartiya viraasat kii anivaary paribhaasha sunne ko milegi, aise logon ke munh se jo unhen ateet kii bahulata ko sudhaarney ke liye jaruri maanate hai
 Such voices will have to withstand minimal opposition
 haalanki 2018 ke bare main meri ummid yahi he ki viraasat ke visheshgy smarakon or sthalon ke nirantar vistrut hote daayaron se samvaad banaaenge, bagaiyr unke mul yaa taarikh kii parvaah kiye
 And in keeping with the basic spirit of democracy, they will also learn how to take the common people along

 Mohammad Shahabuddin, a leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and named in several dozen cases including murder, opposed the petition filed on Wednesday to send himself from Siwan's District Jail to Delhi's Tihar Jail and transfer the trial of 45 cases against him
 
 yachika kaa virodh karte hue shahabuddin ne nyaayamurti deepak mishra ore amitaav raay kii peeth se kaha ki sivaan jail se tihaad main is tarah kaa sthanantaran anuchit or anyaaypurna he
 This is because it is against the Transfer of Prisoners Act, 1950
 unhone kaha ki kaidiyon ke sthanantaran kanoon 1950 ke khilaaf koi bhi kanoon paarit nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki kaidi puri tarah se rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main aate hai
 The bench said that the petition sought transfer of Shahabuddin from Siwan Jail to Tihar Jail using the authority given under Article 142 to the apex court
 is par nafade ne kaha, aap samvidhan ke tahat mili anuchhed 142 ke adhikaron kaa istemaal nahin kar sakate, jo mere buniyadi adhikaron kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Article 142 of the constitution says that the Supreme Court can issue such an order or order to bring complete justice to any cause or matter pending before it in its jurisdiction, and any arrangement or order issued shall be provided to the whole of India
 Will apply to tippaniyan This was told to the apex court hearing the petition of Chandrakeshwar Prasad and Asha Ranjan
 aashaa ranjan shahabuddin ke kathith aadesh par hatya ke shikaar hue rajdev ranjan kii vidhwaa hai
 Both want to transfer Shahabuddin from Siwan Jail to Tihar Jail and get his cases heard through video conferencing
 chandrakeshwar prasad ke teen beton kii hatya shahabuddin ke kathith anuyaayiyon ne kar di thi
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that no law can be passed against the Transfer of Prisoners Act, 1950, because the prisoners are completely under the jurisdiction of the state government
 peeth ne kaha ki yachika main shahabuddin ko sivaan jail se tihaad jail sthanantarit karne ke liye sheersh adaalat ko anuchhed 142 ke tahat mili adhikaar kaa upyog karte hue sthanantarit karne kii maang kii gai he
 To this Nafade said, "you cannot exercise the rights of Article 142 found under the Constitution, which can violate my basic rights

 In a 25-minute conversation, Rahul informed the PM of his displeasure over the ordinance
 pradhanmantri ne rahul ko bharosa diya he ki vah unki chintaaon ko cabinet ke saamne rakhenge
 According to sources, Rahul told the Prime Minister that he opposed the ordinance only taking care of public sentiment
 unhone pradhanmantri se yah bhi kaha ki unka makasad unka dil dukhaana nahin he
 This was followed by a meeting of the Congress Core Committee on Ordinance, which included Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Ahmed Patel, besides the Prime Minister and Sonia

 He also said, 'it is always possible to change one's mind

 anna hajaare kii kiran bedi or medha patkar samet kai nami hastidhon ke saath baithak chal rahi he
 The special thing is that two of his colleagues are missing from Anna's meeting
 karnataka ke purv lokayukta santosh hegade or purv army chif wike singh is baithak main maujuud nahin hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that where have Anna's two warlords gone from the first meeting for the new team
 kya team banane se pehle hi khatas to nahin paidaa ho gai he
 Although Anna says that this team is not new, but it is also true that in this new team of Anna, many faces are publicly becoming part of a platform for the first time
 philhal anna or unki nai team kii agali ranneeti kaa puri tarah khulaasa abhi tak nahin hua he
 Actually, after the last hunger strike at Jantar Mantar, Arvind Kejriwal announced to form a political party
 anna ne khud ko us party se alag rakhane kaa elaan kiya tha or tabhi tay kiya tha ki ab nai team ke saath nayaa andolan hoga
 a new team has been formed, so Anna has also found a new office for it
 kareeb-kareeb ye tay ho chukaa he ki dilli ke sarvoday inklev main team anna kaa nayaa thikaana hoga
 Apparently, when Anna gets on the field with his new team, his debut will also be new and the outcome and how it will be, is yet to be decided

 shivasena pravaktaa sanjay raut ne kahaaki mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne isse pehle 50-50 formule kii baat kii thi
 Now if CM says that there has been no conversation about the 50-50 formula, then there is no basis for such a conversation
 hamen lagata he ki sachai kii paribhaasha badal gai he
 Let me tell you that on Tuesday, Devendra Fadnavis said that Shiv Sena wants the post of Chief Minister for five years, but asking and being practical are two different things

 There were no exciting matches to be seen in the World Cup so far, but this match of runs at the Chinnaswamy Stadium filled the gap where people breathed till the last ball
 bhartiya team 338 ran par banaakar out ho gai thi lekin england ne aath wicket par 338 ran bana daale or is tarah se vishwa cap main chauthi baar koi match taai chuta
 Tendulkar played an outstanding innings of 120 off 115 balls at the Chinnaswamy Stadium
 unke alaava yuvaraj singh :58:, gautam gambhir :51: or virendra sahvaag :35: ne bhi upyogi yogadan diya
 Indian innings 49, losing the last seven wickets within 24 balls
 5 over tak chali
 Strauss made his career-best, scoring 158 runs off 145 balls with the help of 18 fours and a six and in the meantime shared a 170-run partnership for the third wicket with Ian Bell (69)
 jahir khan ne apni chah gend ke andar teen wicket lekar england ko vishwa cap main sabase bada lakshya hasil karne se roka lekin straas kii team ne bharat ko puure do ank hasil nahin karne diye or donon tiimon ko ek ek ank se santosh karnaa padaa
 England needed 29 runs in the last two overs
 piyush chawla 49waan over karne aaye greem swaan or tim bresanan ne ek ek chakke jadkar 15 ran jutaye
 The final over required 14 runs, in which Ajmal Shahzad hit a six
 aakhri gend par do ran jeet ke liye chahie the lekin munaf ne keval ek ran diya
 Incarnation of Indian innings was Tendulkar's second against England, fifth in World Cup record, 47th in ODI and 98th in international cricket
 unhone apni pari main das chauke or paanch chakke lagaaye or bharat ke naye sixsar king bane
 He added 134 runs for the second wicket with Gambhir
 main aaf da match straas ne haalanki tendulkar kii tarah utkrisht pari kheli
 He and Kevin Pietersen (31) gave England a quick and reliable start, adding 68 runs for the first wicket
 munaf ne petersan ke karaare shaat ko kaich main badalakar yah saajhedaari todi
 Peterson hit Munaf's ball hard and this bowler put a palm on him to save his face
 is prayaas main munaf neeche bhi gir gayi lekin hatheli par lage se gend uchhal gayi or unhone use ek haath se lapak diya
 New batsman Jonathan Trott (16) had trouble reading Piyush Chawla's leg break and was lbw
 straas ko 22 ran ke nijee yoga par jeevandaan mila lekin iske baad unhone bedaag pari kheli
 The spinners were also not able to leave much of an impact on those whose balls they sweep, cut, cover drive all the way
 unhone pari ke 29wein over main yuvaraj kii gend par chaukaa or phir do ran lekar vishwa cap main apana pehla or van de main chatha shatak puraa kiya
 England took the powerplay from the 43rd over
 jahir ne powerple ke pehle over main hi bel or straas ko out karke bharat kii ummiden jagaayi
 In the next over, he scattered the kills of Paul Collingwood and turned the match in India's favor
 bresanan :14: or greem swaan :15: ne haalanki bharat ko romaanchak jeet darj nahin karne di
 Earlier, when India won the toss and landed to bat, Sehwag got a life on the first ball of Anderson's match
 sahvaag ne iske baad kuch achche shaat lagaaye lekin pehle badlaav ke taur par aaye bresanan ne aate hi unki pari kaa ant kar diya
 Wicketkeeper Matt Prior dived to the right and caught him with one hand
 sahvaag ne 26 gend kheli or aath chauke lagaaye

 Will be able to spend and the benefit of subsidy will reach the right people
 arun jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki loksabhaa adhyaksh is bill ke mani bill hone ko lekar santusht hai or ise chunauti nahin di ja sakati

 The data under it will not be made public for anything other than national security
 jetali ne kaha ki koi vyakti khud apni marzi se agar apni pahchaan saajha karnaa chahta he to kar paaegaa lekin uskaa kor biomitric data uski khud kii manzuri ke baad bhi saajha nahin kiya ja sakegaa

 jetali ne kaha ki court main kisi faisle ke vichaaradhin hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki sansad us par kaanoon banane kaa apana haq kho den
 Arun Jaitley also said that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is satisfied about this bill being a money bill and it cannot be challenged
 jetali ne kaha ki aadhaar number kaa vichaar upie ke daur main aayaa, jo ek acha vichaar he haalanki tab hamaare dal ke kai logon ne bhi is par aitaraaz jataae the, lekin jab nae vichaar aate hai to unka virodh bhi hota hi he
 Jaitley said that there is no reason for fear of breach of personal privacy under this bill
 iske tahat jo data he use rashtriya suraksha ke alaava kisi or chiz ke liye kisi bhi haal main saarvajanik nahin kiya jayega
 Jaitley said that if a person wants to share his identity on his own, he will be able to do it, but his core biometric data will not be shared even after his own approval
 tippaniyan The decision to share information in matters of national security will be made by an authority headed by a senior level officer in the government and its decisions will be reviewed by a committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary
