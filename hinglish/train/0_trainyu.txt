 Anant Singh, who has become an MLA from Dangerous Dawn, has hardly learned this lesson but it seems that this law of physics also applies in life, especially as a reaction to mindless actions
 haalanki yah bhi sach he ki kai baar santulan banane vaali takat sataha par aane main kuch samay leti he
 The 52-year-old JD (U) MLA, identified as the notorious Babli of Bihar politics, was forced to leave the vacant land in front of his hotel in posh Pataliputra Colony, Patna, on which he allegedly tried to encroach
 Had
 dilachasp baat yah he ki apni dabang chhavi se aatank paidaa karne vaale or logon ko jhukne par majaboor karne vaale anant singh ko apni party kii hi ek vidhayak or samaaj kalyaan mantri parveen amanulla kii vajah se peeche hatane ko majaboor hona padaa
 The hotel authorities had laid siege to the pitch being used for the children's games and the space used for the elders' walks
 gheri gai jagah ko asthaayee rup se to hotel kii parking ke liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha, lekin agar amanulla ne samay se aage aakar is mudde ko uthaaya na hota or atikaraman kaa virodh na kiya hota to is jagah ko hotel ke saath mila lene kaa andeshaa tha
 "he even started building a wall there," says Amanullah
 ''behad posh patliputra ilaake main 10,000 vargafoot se zyada jagah main failaa anant singh kaa buddha heritage hotel (jo kareeb 8 karod ru
 Will be of) has recently started
 patliputra socity ke niyamon ke mutabik, is ilaake main koi vyavsaayik gatividhi nahin chalaai ja sakati
 But no one had the courage to question Anant Singh in this matter
 pichley ek hafte main yahaan tagada drama dekhne ko mila
 And this resulted in a confrontation between the two JD (U) leaders
 aakhirkaar badhate dabaav kii vajah se anant singh jagah chhodie ko raji ho gaye
 However, it was not so easy for RTI activist turned minister Parveen Amanullah
 shuru main jab amanulla ne hotel prabandhan se atikaraman hataane ko kaha to anant ngkshasah ne unki baat ko khaarij kar diya, yahaan tak ki unhone is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki unhone koi atikaraman kiya he
 At this, Amanullah approached the Pataliputra House Construction Society, and its acting president B
K
 ke
 Sinha and two directors — Kumkum Narayan and Major M
 ke
 Mukherjee resigned so that he could save himself from taking any action on such influential encroachers
 ab amanulla kii badi pahal kii baari thi
 She arrived in front of Anant Singh's hotel without any security and instructed the hotel officials to immediately remove the encroachment
 buudhvaar ko hotel prabandhan ko dhahaai gai charadivari kii tiles ek mini vine main rakhte or vahaan se hataate dekha gaya
 The success of Amanullah's anti-encroachment campaign against Anant Singh will have far reaching effects as it has awakened the entire society to make sure that the musclemen can be challenged and forced to follow the rules
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki pichley kuchhek saalon main anant singh kii sampatti kai guna bad gai he
 In 2005, he made 3 in his election affidavit
 40 lakh ru
 It was announced to be a nominal asset of Rs
 38 in 2010
 84 lakh ru
 Reached
 ab tak saarvajanik taur par aisi koi jaankaree saamne nahin ai he ki unase kabhi is durlabh tareeke se or tatkaal amir banane ke bare main koi sawaal kiya gaya ho
 Unlike Nitish Kumar's model of good government, Singh is notorious for running a parallel government in his area
 yah bhi utana hi sach he ki satta ne shaayad hi un par kabhi lagaam lagane kii koshish kii ho
 In January 2008, when the family in a murder case alleged that Anant Singh had hatched the crime, Bihar police did not like to arrest him
 singh ko pichhali baar november, 2007 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha, jab unhone ek tivi patrkaar ko peeta tha
 However, he came out of judicial custody within 10 days
 ajgar paalane jaisi apni sanak ke liye charchit ye vidhayak mahoday pehle bhi kai vivaadon main funs chuke hai
 For example, arbitrarily using the other's Mercedes by force or aerial firing during an event in 2004
 vaise chunavi halafname main singh khud ko padhaa-likhaa bataate hai
 Although late, but in the last few years, he seems to be avoiding controversies
 phir bhi jedy (you) or sarkaar main unke asar ko koi chunauti dene vaala nahin he
 Parveen Amanullah's success against the domineering MLA is very important in the current political environment
 ab amanulla kii baat
 Before joining politics, she was leading the RTI movement and was the convener of Bihar Right to Information Forum
 purv saansad or rajanyik saiyad shahabuddin kii beti or rajya sarkaar main mantri amanulla puure aatmavishvaas ke saath kahati hai, ''mujhe daraaya nahin ja saktaa

 '' sarkaar main unke saathiyon ko unase thodi prerana leni chahie taaki bihar kaa maahaul or behatar ho sake
 Under the banner of the Secondary Computer Instructors Association, the strike of the computer instructors sitting on the dharna in Laxman fair ground continued for the 10th day

 abhi tak duulhe ghodi yaa bike par hi baraat lekar aate hai
 Or the groom comes to the bride's house sitting in the car
 lekin pashchim bengal main ek aisi baraat nikali, jise dekh har koi hairaan rah gaya
 Because in this procession the groom came to sit on the road roller
 ji haa, us road roller par jisase sadaken banaai jaati hai
 The procession took place in the city of Nadia in West Bengal
 jahaan duulhaa-dulhan apni shaadi ko 'wild' bananaa chaahate the
 So usually on some different road roller, not on horse or bike, the groom went to pick his bride
 is baraat ko jisane bhi dekha wo camere main kaid kiye bina rah nahi paaya
 Yes, the road roller was well decorated with flowers and lights
 usapar jhaalaren latakaai gayi or duulhaa driver ke saath hi baitha
 Not only this, he wrote his and his wife's name on the front above the road roller
 duulhurka patra (arka Patra) kaa kahana he ki wo sirf apni shaadi ko special bananaa chahta tha
 The entry in the mare or car is very old, so he came on the road roller
 aage usne bataaya ki wo ek wintage car main apni shaadi main aana chahta tha, lekin road roller hi mila
 It cost me a lot
 vahiin, dulhan arundhati tarafdaar (arundhati Tarafdar) kaa kahana he ki apane hone vaale pati ki is entry se bah behad impress hai

 The incident is of Panna district headquarters
 sab mookadarshak ban dekhte rahe tamaashinsaaniyat ko sharmasaar kar dene vaali yah ghatana bas stand par ghati
 Mehdele had reached there on the state's foundation day to participate in cleanliness work under the cleanliness drive
 kaarykram khatm hone par vah apni car kii ore bad rahi thim, tabhi kareeb 10 saal ek baccha bheekh main ek rupaya maangata hua aayaa or apana sir unke pairon ke aage rakh diya
 The child was constantly asking for money by placing his head in front of the minister's feet
 is par mantri gussa gayi or unhone uske sir par laat maar di
 Seeing this, all the people present there were shocked, but no one dared to say anything
 vahiin maujuud afasaron ne bachche ko khinchakar peeche kiya
 Video viral, video of BJP minister kicking child on backfoot went viral
 iske baad rajya kii siyasat main bhi ubaal aa gaya
 The Congress is attacking the government, while the ruling party is on the defensive
 bijepi ke hitesh vaajapeyi ne is bare main kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya
 Pretended that they had not seen the video
 is bare main video dekhne ke baad hi kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 Congress spokesperson
 ke
 Mishra said that such a minister does not have the right to hold the post even for a minute
 kisaanon kii khudakushi par bhi diya tha betuka bayanisse pehle mehdele kisaanon kii khudakushi par bhi betuka bayaan de chuki hai
 Recently, he had said in Damoh district that if a farmer does not commit suicide on the death of a young son, then how can one commit suicide due to crop failure, while the grief of the death of the young son is much greater
 savarna aarakshan, dodhari talwardesh main aarakshan kii raajnneeti bahut gahari he or har chunaav se pehle is par haath aajamaaya jaataa he
 The Narendra Modi government at the Center has rekindled the politics of reservation by deciding to give 10 percent reservation in government jobs to the economically backward upper castes just before the elections
 rajyon ke chunaavon main mili haar ke baad bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko laga ki dalit utpeedan kanoon kii joardaar tarafdaari karne se uskaa savarna vot bank khisakta ja rahaa he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the upper caste organization, the Backward Classes Minority Welfare Society (SPX), started a vigorous agitation after Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that one cannot abolish Mai's red reservation
 haalanki apane pratyaashee utarkar bhi sapaks koi raajnneetik shakti nahin ban saki
 This decision of the Modi government seems to be an attempt to reduce the displeasure of the upper castes in the elections
 chunaav se pehle aarakshan kaa pintara pichhali upie sarkaar ne bhi apanaaya tha jab usne alpsankhyakon ko 4
 5% reservation was announced but that decision could not stand in court
 court main tik na paane kii pramukh vajah thos aankadon or taaja survey kaa na hona he
 Actually, the government has caste-based census data but it has not made it public
 pichhadepan kii paimaaish karne ke liye jatiyon kaa survey karana hota he jo desh main hota nahin he
 At present, 49 including the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the country
 5 fisadi aarakshan he
 The Supreme Court has made it clear in its judgment of Indira Sawhney in 1992 that the total reservation cannot exceed 50 per cent
 aisa karnaa samanta ke adhikaar ke khilaaf jaataa he
 Despite this, reservation in some states like Tamil Nadu is more than this limit, whose case is going on in the Supreme Court
 ye baat sach he ki garib savarnon ko bhi sarkari madad kii jarurat he, thik usee tarah jaise anya jatiyon ko mil rahi he
 But they have also not been surveyed, which puts a question mark on its future
 raajnneetik najariye se dekha jaae to garib savarnon ke liye ghoshit aarakshan is varg kii naaraazgi ko dur karne kaa ek prayaas he
 On this, the government is going to bring a constitutional amendment proposal, which will not be easy for him to pass
 samvidhan main aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat nahin kahi gai he
 And to give reservation on economic grounds, it will be necessary to amend the constitution
 is prastaav par dalon ke rukh se bhaajapa chunaav maidan main apni ranneeti ko dhar degi
 She would like to be attacked on this basis
 ye faisla aise samay aada he jab iskaa virodh karnaa kisi bhi dal ke liye phydemand nahin hoga par vipaksh ise sire bhi nahin chadhane degaa
 Perhaps the BJP will see its advantage in not letting the ends rise, when it defames the opposition parties hanging the proposal as anti-upper caste
 savarna virdohi hone kaa tamgaa bhi bhaajapa kii virdohi partiyaan nahin lenaa chahenge
 Therefore, she will try to find a big flaw in the proposal
 aarakshan ek dodhari talwaar he, iske phaayde or nuksaan donon hi gahare hote hai
 BSP supremo Mayawati did unilateral politics on reservation but could not take the scope of her acceptance out of her vote bank
 upie ke daur main congress ne khud ko muslimon kaa maseehaa bataane kii koshish kii lekin is chakkar main satta se hi haath dho baithi
 During the Bihar elections, the Sangh chief's statement of reservation became a weapon for anti-bjp parties
 savarnon ko aarakshan ke elaan se anya jatiyon-virgon main naaraazgi bhi punap sakati he
 But the poor upper castes are determined to have an electoral battle over the reservation and the more outspoken the risk for it
 haalanki, jediu kaa kahana he ki vah aam chunaav 2019 main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa saamana karne ke liye bane sanyukt morcha main shaamil rahegi lekin nitish kumaar kii haal kii gatividhiyaan party ke bayaan se bilkul ulat hai

 kendriya vittamantri arun jetali ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main die gaye bhaashan ko lekar karaara tanj ksaa he
 During this, BJP leader Jaitley questioned Rahul Gandhi's understanding
 unhonerahul gandhise sawaal poocha he ki aakhir wo kitna jaanate hai? wo chizon ko kab samajhenge? isse pehle kisaan golicond kii barsi par mandsaur pahunche rahul gandhi ne centre kii modi sarkaar or rajya kii shivaraj singh sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Last year, six farmers were killed in police firing in Mandsaur
 mandsaur main congress kii 'kisaan samruddhi sankalp raily' ko sambodhit karte hue gandhi ne kaha ki jis din madhya pradesh main congress kii sarkaar aegi, uske 10 din ke andar kisaanon kaa karj maaf ho jayega
 This visit of Rahul Gandhi is considered to be very important before the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 is raily main madhya pradesh congress ke kamalnath, digvijay singh, jyotiraditya sindhiya samet kai bade netaa maujuud rahe
 On the other hand, after the Congress President's rally, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back with a Facebook post
 unhone rahul gandhi ke gyaan or samajhadaari par hi sawaal uthaa die
 Jaitley wrote, 'after listening to Rahul Gandhi's speech given in Madhya Pradesh, my curiosity about the answer to this question increased further
 kya unhen aparyaapt jaankaree di jaati he yaa vah apane tathyon ko lekar kuch zyada hi udaar hai
 During this time he also pointed out the flaws in the allegations made by Rahul Gandhi
 piem modi par 15 sheersh udyogpatiyon ke 2
 In response to Rahul Gandhi's allegation of waiving the loan of Rs 5 lakh crore, Jaitley said, "this statement of the Congress President is factually completely wrong
" modi sarkaar ne udyogpatiyon kaa ek rupee kaa bhi karj maaf nahin kiya he
 Jaitley said, "those who owed banks and other financial institutions were declared insolvent and were evicted from their company through IBC
" is kanoon ko modi sarkaar ne lagu kiya
 Most of these loans were given during the UPA regime
 'rahul gandhi aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar ke paas kisaanon ko lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai, jabaki udyogpatiyon ko khub lone diya ja rahaa he
 Jaitley said that this fact is factually incorrect
 unhone kaha ki upie shasankaal main zyada maatra main udyogpatiyon ko lone die gaye, jo aaj enpie ban chuke hai
 The bulk of this was given by banks in 2008–14
 vahiin, modi sarkaar ne in paison kii recovery ke liye kadam uthaaya he
 Rahul Gandhi alleged that PM Modi gave 35-35 thousand crores to two diamond traders, who now left the country
 is par jetali ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki yah tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 Bank fraud started in 2011
 us samay upie kaa shashan tha
 This fraud was detected after the arrival of the NDA government
 congress ne jetali ko bataaya krishi se anbhijyajetali ke kataaksh par palatwaar karte hue congress party ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne aarope lagaaya ki gaanvon main sankat, krishi kshetra main karj, kisaanon kii aatmahatya or upaj kaa nunatam samarthan mulya se kam par bikna narendra modi sarkaar main ek nayaa chalan ban gaya he
 He said, 'minister Arun Jaitley is ignorant of agriculture without the department, but today he is giving knowledge to the country
 ’surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar desh ke liye enpie ban chuki he
 Agricultural growth rate in Modi government 1
 9 fisadi he, jabaki upie sarkaar main yah 4
 Was 2 percent
 unhone daawa kiya ki mandsaur main rahul gandhi kii kisaan raily kii vajah se kisaan virdohi bijepi kii buniyaad hill gai he
 Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan, angry with Rahul Gandhi's attack on Congress, said that first Rahul Gandhi should answer that Congress ruled for so many years, but farmers have yet to get water for irrigation not found
 kisaanon ko 18 fisadi byaaj main lone dene vaali congress aaj bijepi se sawaal kar rahi he
 Whereas BJP has decided to give loans to farmers at zero percent interest
 chouhan ne kaha ki congress ke jamaane main to khaad ke liye laathiyaan chalati thim
 And when they talk about the bullet, then tell me who was the Chief Minister when the bullet was fired in Multai? He said that more than 21 farmers had died in Multai in Betul district
 pehle congress uskaa hisaab de

 "amitabh Bachchan has been awarded many awards in his career
 bachapan main hamaare dada-daadi bataaya karte the ki wo jab chote hua karte the yani unke bachapan main cinema matlab amitabh bachchan
 However, it is not that only Amitabh was there

 But what used to be Amitabh's craze, he was just a few people
 magar baat agar hamaare jamaane yani aaj kii kare to yah kahana koi galat nahin hoga ki amitabh hamaare jamaane ke abhinayta nahin he

 The 1975 film Sholay, which every child born in the late 90s would have seen Amitabh's first film in his childhood, would be Sholay
 maine bhi amitabh kii sabase pehali film dekhi to wo sholay hi thi
 But not only Sholay, Shahenshah, Zanjeer, Namakahlal, Deewar, Marda, Lavaris, Kalia, if all these films come on TV today, then people do not take the name of moving in front of the TV
 kehete hai naa kii bollywood yani amitabh bachchan
 It would not be wrong to say that the way Amitabh is performing on the silver screen for the last five decades with his best roles, Amitabh is still as active as he was at the age of 76
 iskaa pramaan wo kai baar de chuke hai
 Amitabh has played such characters that hardly anyone else could have played so well
 phir wo chaahe paa film main paa kaa kirdaar ho jo aaj bhi koi paa ke kirdaar ko dekh kar pahchaan nahin saktaa ki ye amitabh bachchan hai
 There will hardly be any artist in the film industry with whom Amitabh Bachchan would not have worked

 Along with this, Amitabh has been awarded Padma Shri in the year 1984, Padma Bhushan in 2001 and Padma Vibhushan in the year 2015

 That means Dadasaheb Phalke Award

 Which is called Dadasaheb Phalke Award

 ' doctor or chikitsakarmiyon ke kami ke chalate rajasthan sarkaar ab swasthya sevaaon main pipipi model apnaanaa chaahati he
 Initially, 35 primary health centers in Rajasthan have been removed from the government and given to the private sector
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki aaj jahaan 10,996 chikitsakon kii jarurat he, vahaan 3034 pad rikt hai
 Out of 67,755 posts in nursing staff, 37,927 posts are vacant
 is kaaran gramin kshetron main praathmik swasthya sevaayen sucharu rup se chal hi nahin paati, kyonki gaanv main log posting aate hi apana transfar karvaa lete hai or aise main sabase zyada prabhavit ho rahi hai matra evam shishu sevaayen
 Nims Hospital is now running the primary health center at Achrol village near Jaipur
 prayog ke taur par rajasthan sarkaar ne aise hi 35 praathmik swasthya kendron ko nijee haathon main de diya he
 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje told NDTV, "we have done this because we are short of doctors
" log ummid karte hai praathmik chikitsa centre par doctor milegaa, lekin gaanv main doctors rahanaa nahin chaahate
 If we run in PPP mode, then perhaps the health services in the village will be better
 chikitsakon kii kami sarkaar ke liye ek chunauti jarur he
 As of today Rajasthan does not have 30% doctors
 sarkaar ko jarurat he 415 specialists kii, lekin rikt pad hai 200, unhen chahie 3011 junior specialists inke paas hai sirf 1596 or stri rog visheshgyon main haalat sabase kharaab he
 The government needs only 412 doctors, 231 praathmik swasthya kendron ko sarkaar bhi kuch sharton par nijee companiyon ko de rahi he
 According to government regulations, two doctors, nurses, lab technicians should always be present in the center
 sari suvidhaayen sarkari daron par hi uplabdh hogin, lekin agar nijee company atirikt seva dena chaahati he jaise xray to ve jaanchen bhi sarkari daron par hongi

" apni bahu kii delivery karwaane ai prem bai ne kaha, pehle yahaan itani saaf-safai nahin dikhaai detii thi, ret or dhul-mitti ab nahin dikhti
 But there are also concerns about this experiment
 vipaksh or saamaajik sansthaaon kaa kahana he ki swasthya sevaaon ko nijee haathon main dekar sarkaar apni jimmedaari se peeche hat rahi he
 It is also a way to benefit private companies
 sarkaar ke hat jane se zimmedaari kiski hogi or yah kaise tay hoga ki yahaan suvidhaayen niyamon ke anusaar uplabdh karwaai ja rahi hai

 People hope to get a doctor at the first aid center, but doctors do not want to stay in the village

 tigmanshu dhulia nirdeshit ye film 27 july ko relies hogi
 Apart from Sanjay, the film will also feature Chitrangada Singh, Mahi Gill and Jimmy Shergill
 bataa den ki pichley donon part is film ke hit rahe hai
 a motion poster of Sahab, Biwi and Gangster 3 has also been launched, showing Sanjay gun taunts
 trailor se pataa chalata he ki sanjay khalanaayak bane he
 He says in a dialogue of the film, "anyone who has heard about me may have heard bad, but i am not so bad that standing next to me will bring disrepute
 ' maahi gil or jimi shergill ke dialog bhi jabardast he
 Box office: First Day Sanju made history, broke Salman's Race 3 record that Nafisa Ali is also making a comeback after a long time from 'sahab Biwi Aur Gangster 3'
 is film main vah sanjay dutt kii maa kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai, vahiin kabir bedi or sanjay dutt film main teen dashak baad saath kaam kar rahe hai

 ' gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye congress ne modi kaa daanv apana liya he
 He had already given clear signs of dealing with BJP and RSS by making Hindutva a weapon
 june main chennai main party kii ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki vah bijepi or RSS se raajnneetik jang ladane ke liye upanishad gita pard rahe hai
 Now Rahul Gandhi is doing rallies and touring for Gujarat Fatah
 is dauraan vah lagaataar mandir bhi ja rahe hai or puja archana kar rahe hai
 The reason for Rahul's Hindutva leaning is considered political
 aaj buudhvaar ko bhi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne vidhansabha chunaav ke darmyaan apane chauthe gujarat daure kii shuruyaat gandhinagar ke akshardham mandir main darshan ke saath kii
 During this period, the saint of Akshardham temple received Rahul Gandhi
 yah vahi mandir he, jahaan haal hi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane gujarat daure ke samay gaye the
 PM Modi also attended the silver jubilee celebrations of Akshardham temple in Gujarat
 us samay akshardham mandir main sant brahmabihari swami ne piem modi kii agavaaniki thi
 Not only this, today Rahul Gandhi will also visit Ambaji temple in Banaskantha district
 vah raat ko ambaji main hi thahrenge
 This soft Hindutva stance of the Congress party is seen at a time when the party is pushing for the return of power in Gujarat
 siyaasi ranneeti ke tahat hi rahul ke pehle daure se lekar aakhri daure yani is chauthe daure tak main jo bhi kaarykram bane wo hindu dharm ke ird-gird hi ghoomte rahe
 Interestingly, during this time no Muslim leader was even seen wandering around during Rahul's visit
 is chunaav main congress ne muslim kaa mudda bhi nahin uthaaya
 In the election campaign so far, Congress has raised the issue of either Patidar community or demonetisation and GST
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ke bhaashanon main bhi chutila andaaj dekhne ko mila
 Meanwhile, Rahul's popularity on social media also increased
 twitor par rahul ke folovers kii sankhya badhane par sawaal bhi uthe, jiskaa jawaab rahul gandhi ne pidi kaa video twit karke diya
 After this, Rahul's PD went on a rampage on Twitter and there was a lot of debate on it
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya rahul soft hindutv ke sahare gujarat main apni fatah pataakaa fahraa paaenge

 ab film pramotion ke dauraan kichcha ne ruthik roshne se judaa ek khulaasa kiya he
 He told that after Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, i did not hate anyone as much as i did with Hrithik Roshan
 is vajah se kichcha ne 10 se zyada baar dekhi kaho naa pyaar habollywood hangaamaa se intervyuu main kichcha ne kaha- 'mujhe lagata he ki agar main ruthik roshan ke saath ek film karuunga, to jo pehla vyakti set par report karegaa, wo meri patni hogi
 She is a big fan of Hrithik Roshan
 meri patni kii vajah se maine kaho naa pyaar he, jo ki ruthik kii pehali film thi use 10 se zyada baar dekha he
 "my wife threatened me that if i don't go to see the film, then she will go away with someone else and she won't be a girl
" to, main gaya, baitha, film dekhi or waapas aa gaya
 When i first saw the film, i loved it
 mujhe ruthik bahut pasand aae
 Their dance
 
 
 lekin maine iske baad kabhi kisi se nafrat nahin kii
 Whenever Hrithik was dancing, he would pinch me while holding my hand and hold my hand and i think hey i am also an actor
 kaho naa pyaar he meri jindagi main ek pej ban gai

 kya unki jagah mukhyalay se lekar zilon ke karyaalay tak main iti cell chalaane vaale khud ko mahatvapurn kaaryakarta samajhane lage hai or puraane kaaryakartaaon kaa kaam sirf whatsap main bheje gaye sandeshon ko farverd karnaa rah gaya he
 Political parties have changed a lot
 is chunaav main jab bhartiya janata party pradhanmantri modi ke netritv main duusari baar ke liye daavedaari kar rahi he, kai zilon main uske nae karyaalay banakar taiyaar ho chuke hai
 This office of Meerut is now in a dilapidated state, but it may not have always been so
 party ke shuruaati dinon kii yahaan kitni yaaden hogin
 How many workers must have been consumed by coming here and have become so great
 is daftar main bijepi kaa kshetreey or zila karyaalay bhi chalata tha
 Our colleague Shyam Parmar told that this old office of Meerut is the property of Baba Manohar Nath Temple Trust in which BJP office was running in a big room for 20-25 years
 jaise faizabad kaa yah karyaalay purana he
 During the demolition of Babri Masjid, all the big leaders of BJP will have to come here
 magar ab yah beete dinon kii blike and white tasveeron sa lagane laga he
 The bjp's charity and rental offices built in 1980 will be erased from history
 isi tarah phirozabad kaa yah daftar purana ho chukaa he
 In front of SN Hospital used to be near the intersection of Jain temple which is now closed
 ab nayaa karyaalay yahaan ban rahaa he
 One kilometer from Dabrai headquarters is being built on Firozabad Road NH-2
 shoping kamplex main chal rahaa he
 It is now locked here
 ek party kai sau nae daftar bana rahi he
 It is neither discussed nor reported on
 19 may 2015 kii mint kii khabar kahati he ki zamin se naata jodne ke prayaas main or samarthakon se fund lene ke liye bijepi karyaalayon kaa ek rashtriya network banaaegi
 The BJP is to form the party's office in 630 districts which will be connected to the state and Delhi headquarters through video conferencing
 bijepi ke paas 280 zilon main hi karyaalay hai or 2016 tak baaki ke 350 zilon main daftar ban kar taiyaar ho jayega
 Where there is an office, a new office is also built
 inaki laagat kya he, zamin kharidne se lekar imaaraten banane kaa kharchaa kya isaki jaankaree hamen nahin he
 According to the news about party funds in the media, in 2017-18, six political parties received a total of 1293 crore
 sabase adhik balki 90 pratishat se adhik bijepi kii aay 1027 karod he
 53 of which
 9 pratishat aay agyaat sorce se hui hai he
 a researcher should have studied, recorded what is the design of more than 600 new offices, the design of which would present a picture of what kind of political party in the coming days
 imaarat ke bheetar adhyaksh se lekar mahasachivon ke baithne kii vyavastha kis prakaar sanghathan ke dhaanche kaa bayaan kar rahi he
 Through these headquarters and offices, BJP is also creating new memories in the coming days
 ho saktaa he ki ab party kii gatividhi main karyaalay kii bhoomika pehle se kahin adhik sthaayee or mahatvapurn hone vaali he
 The practice of running a party from someone's home or shop may stop
 jaise meerut main daftar kii imaarat banakar taiyaar he
 The view reminds me of malls and three star hotels, but this office is made of money from the party fund
 zamin kharidi gai he
 There is a parking arrangement
 pratham tal par 200 logon kii kshamta vaala haul he
 There is also a conference hall
 34 kamare hai
 Within it, it seems that the days of politics run by the buildings given in Dan Dakshina are gone
 kaaryakarta or netaaon ko aate hi lagegaa ki ve shoping kamplex main aa gaye hai
 Till now, even after having office in the party, the leaders used to hold meetings in their own house or hotel, but with such preparation, it seems that all this will also be stopped and the political activity of the party will go from the office of the influential not from the shop
 staff ke nivas kii bhi vyavastha he
 We tried to find the cost of this but the information was not given
 kaha gaya ki lakhanu aphis se kharid hui thi, unhen pataa hoga
 Delhi also has a new BJP headquarters in 2018, sometimes search for it on the Internet
 bheetar kii tasviir shaayad hi mili
 The whole picture is outside the headquarters
 yah mukhyalay kitne main bana, media report main isaki koi pukhta jaankaree nahin mili
 It is headquartered in 2 acres of land
 iske teen block hai
 One block is of 7 floors
 baaki do blaak 3-3- manzil ke hai
 There are 70 rooms
 iconomik times main 18 farvari 2018 kii report he
 In it, Amit Shah's statement is that no party has such a big headquarters in the world
 isaki laagat kitni he, kabhi nahin bataai gai
 Ito cannot have such a grand headquarters with two to four crores
 yah zarur he ki sab dilli main nahin bana he balki zilon main bhi daftar bane hai
 
 akele uttar pradesh main 51 nae daftar banakar taiyaar hai or ban rahe hai
 Many places are completely ready and many are in the final stages
 phirozabad kaa daftar bhi nayaa hi bana he
 These offices are ready, but due to the elections, many places have not been fully operational
 imaarat ke rang main bhaajapa ke jhande ke bhi do rang hai
 There was a news report in the media about the new office of Mathura that electricity was going on without connection i
e
 electricity was being stolen
 media main report aane ke baad conection le liya gaya he
 The Mathura office is in Pushpanjali Upavan
 kareeb 200 meter jagah main he
 According to an estimate the cost of the land will be 45-50 lakhs and the cost of building the building can be 60-70 lakhs
 yani kareeb sava se dedh karod kii laagat kii baat sutara kehete hai
 But this is not enough information
 bhaajapa kaa yah karyaalay upi ke shravasti kii he
 The same Shravasti where the promise of creating the Buddha Circle did not happen in two years but in a year the new office of the BJP was formed
 yahaan bhi pehle bhaajapa kaa apana daftar nahin tha
 The BJP did not have its own office in Bahraich but a new building is almost ready
 teen manzila imaarat kaa udghaatan ho chukaa he
 The cost of this building could not be known
 ek party kaa sainkadon kii sankhya main karyaalay bananaa koi saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 On April 6, BJP will inaugurate its party offices in 51 districts of UP simultaneously
 51 karyaalay karodon rupee se hi bane honge magar sahi sankhya koi nahin bataata
 After all, there would have been some cost in buying land and building a three-storey building at 51 places
 kya ek raajnneetik dal ko isaki jaankaree khud se nahin deni chahie
 How many crores did the BJP spend in building new offices across the country and in UP
 yani na mandi kaa asar padaa na notebandi kaa asar hua
 The real state may be slow, but the BJP has shown that its own real estate has been successful
 isi tarah madhya pradesh chunaavon ke samay anuraag dwari ne jabalpur main bijepi ke nae karyaalay kaa haal bataaya tha
 Madhya Pradesh has 51 districts
 9 zile ko chhod kar sabhi main nae karyaalay ban chuke hai
 42 new offices have been built
 kya yah jaananaa dilachasp nahin rahegaa ki saikadon kii sankhya main daftar banane main bijepi ne kitne karod kharch kiye
 Where does the money come from kya chande ke paise se ye sab hua he

 ' Rama Ekadashi has great significance in Hinduism
 manyata he ki is vrath ke prabhaav se sabhi paap nasht ho jate hai
 According to mythological beliefs, a devotee who fasts and recites Rama Ekadashi with a true mind and law, gets rid of all sins and after death he attains Vishnu Loka
 is ekadshi (ekadashi) ke din bhagwaan vishnu ke saath hi maa lakshmi kaa pujan (maa Lakshmi Puja) karnaa bhi behad shubh or mangalakaari mana jaataa he
 Rama Ekadashi comes a day before Dhanteras
 is prakaar se vichaar kar shobhan ne vrath rakh liya or vah bhukh va pyaas se atyant peedit hone laga
 When Surya Narayana got set and the time of awakening came at night which was very pleasing to the Vaishnavas, but extremely painful for Shobhan
 praat:kaal hote shobhan ke praan nikal gaye
 Then the king cremated him with perfumed wood
 shobhan kii antyeshti kriya ke baad apane pita ke ghar main hi rahane lagi
 Under the influence of Rama Ekadashi, Shobhan received a beautiful Devpur on the Mount Mandarachal, rich in wealth and devoid of enemies
 vah atyant sundar ratna or vaiduryamani jatit swarna ke khambhon par nirmit anek prakaar kii sphatik maniyon se sushobhit bhawan main bahumoolya vastrabhupanon tathaa chhatra va chanwar se vibhooshit, gandharva or apsaraon se yukt singhaasana par arudh aisa shobhyman hota tha maano doosraa indra virajman ho
 Once a Brahmin named Som Sharma, who lived in Muchukund Nagar, went wandering around while doing pilgrimage and he recognized Shobhan and said that it is the king's Jamai Shobhan, went near him
 shobhan bhi use pahchaan kar apane asana se uthakar uske paas aayaa or pranamadi karke kushal prashn kiya
 The Brahmin said, "king Muchukund and your wife are from Kushal
 nagar main bhi sab prakaar se kushal hai, parantu he rajan! hamen aashcharya ho rahaa he
 Tell your account that such a beautiful city that has never been seen or heard, how did you get it
 " Then Shobhan said that i got this city by fasting on Rama Ekadashi of Kartik Krishna, but it is unstable
 yah sthir ho jaae aisa upaay kiijie
 The Brahmin started saying, "O Rajan! Why is it not stable and how can it be stable? Tell me, then i will definitely take that remedy
" meri is baat ko aap mithyaa na samajhie
 "shobhan said," i have done this fast in reverence
 at: yah sab kuch asthir he
 If you call all the accounts of Muchukund's daughter Chandrabhaga, then it can be stable
 " Hearing this, that superior Brahmin returned to his city and narrated all the accounts from Chandrabhaga
 brahman ke vachan sunakar chandrabhaga badi prasannataa se brahman se kehane lagi, "he brahman! ye sab baaten aapane pratyaksh dekhi hai yaa swapn kii baaten kar rahe hai
 The Brahmin started saying, "O daughter! i have seen your husband directly in Mahavan
 saath hi kisi se vijay na ho aisa devataaon ke nagar ke samaan unka nagar bhi dekha he
 He also said that it is not stable
 jis prakaar vah sthir rah sake so upaay karnaa chahie
 " chandrabhaga kehane lagi, "he wipro! tum mujhe vahaan le chalo, mujhe patidev ke darshan kii teevr laalasaa he
 i will make that city stable with my virtue
 aap aisa kaary kiijie jisase unka hamaara sanyog ho kyonki viyogi ko mila dena mahaan punya he
 "upon hearing this, the Brahmin went to Chandrambhaga's ashram of Vamdev Rishi near Mandarachal mountain
 vamdevji ne sari baat sunakar veda mantron ke uccharan se chandrabhaga kaa abhishek kar diya
 Then with the effect of the sage's mantra and fasting on Ekadashi, Chandrabhaga's body became divine and she attained divine speed
 iske baad badi prasannataa ke saath apane pati ke nikat gai
 Shobhan was overjoyed to see his beloved wife coming and called her and seated her on her left side
 chandrabhaga kehane lagi, "he prannath! aap mere punya ko grahan kiijie
 Ever since i was eight years old at my father's house, i have been paying homage to Ekadashi fast
 is punya ke pratap se aapkaa yah nagar sthir ho jayega or samast karmon se yukt hokar pralay ke ant tak rahegaa
 "thus Chandrabhaga began to live happily with her husband, equipped with divine clothes and robes

 shivasena ke divangat adhyaksh bal thakare ke bete jayadev thakare ne mangalvaar ko bombai hai court main daawa kiya ki unke pita unhen apana raajnneetik uttaradhikari bananaa chaahate the lekin vah khud iske liye icchhuk nahin the jabaki unki purv patni smita kii apni khud kii raajnneetik mahatvakankshaayen thim
 On the second day, when asked by the lawyers of younger brother Uddhav Thackeray, Jaidev said that after the death of his grandfather in 1973, he started helping his father
 bal thakare ke bade bete bindu madhav apane vyapaar or filmon se jude kaamo main lag gaye the
 At that time Uddav was quite serious about his hobby photography and so his father depended on him for his political works
 is dauraan unhone jayadev ko raajnneeti se judane ke liye bhi kaha
 But Jaydev believed that politics is a bad thing, in which relationships do not matter
 isliye unhone apane pita ko kah diya tha ki wo raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahate
 Jaidev said- Uddhav conspired to remove the name from the ration card, in the court filled with Jaydev, it was alleged that Uddhav had hatched a conspiracy to remove his name from the family's ration card
 jayadev ne bataaya ki 2003 se hi ghar main uddhav kaa prabhaav rahane laga tha or us samay ek shaks ne eke unhen ek kaagaj par hastakshar karne ko kaha jisase unka naam rashan card se hat jaataa
 Jaidev had asked that person, who told him to do this, then he said Saheb
 jayadev kaa kahana tha ki unke liye ek hi sahib the wo unke pita the
 So when he asked his father about this, Bal Thackeray refused to do so
 unhone ye tak kaha ki wo is sharaarat kii jad tak ja kar pataa karange ki aakhir ye kisne kiya
 Uddhav's lawyer tried to ask Jaidev, after all Uddhav did this how he felt
 lekin jayadev ne yahi jawaab diya
 Jayadev's wife was asked to leave the court
 Jayadev's wife Anuradha was also present in the court but was asked to leave
 is dauraan jayadev ne bataaya ki 1991 ke aasapaas unki maa minaa thakare ne ghar ko todakar vapas banane kii baat kahi thi
 The parents had first told this plan to Jayadev and then to the rest of the members
 lekin usee vakt bindu madhav ne ghar main apana hisse par daawa chhod diya tha
 Bindu Madhav had his own house, business and at the same time his children were also tested
 inhi vajahon se unhone ghar par daawa nahin kiya
 According to him, a place was then made for Uddhav, Jaidev and his parents to live and do political work
 vakil ne poocha- matoshri main waapas rahane kyon nahin aae?uddhav ke vakil rohit kapaadiya ne jayadev se poocha ki kya unhone ghar ko banane ke liye paise kharch koi the or kya unke paas iskaa koi saboot he? is par jayadev ne kaha ki ghar ke liye jab saamaan aata tha to koi bhi paise de detaa tha, kai baar unhone bhi cash diya, par isaki koi raseed unke paas nahin he
 On this, Kapadia asked him why he did not come back to Matoshree when the house was ready
 is par jayadev ne kaha ki ghar kii pehali manzil unhone khud apni jaruraton ke hisaab se taiyaar kii thi or usamen unka saaman bhi rakhaa tha
 But then his wife Smita Thackeray who repeatedly talked about entering politics and he was not at all pleased
 pita ke saath din main matoshri main rahata tha: jayadevaunhone smita ko samajhane ko bahut koshish kii thi taaki wo jayadev or unke bete par dhyaan den
 For this Jayadev took his family and started living in a flat on the carpet
 jayadev ne kaha ki jab matoshri taiyaar ho gaya or sab vahaan waapas rahane ke liye jane lage, tab unke pita ne hi unase kaha ki wo smita ke saath kaaleen main rahe
 He too did not like Smita to interfere in Shiv Sena party politics
 jayadev kaa kahana tha ki is dauraan wo apane pita ke saath din main matoshri main rahete or raat main kaaleen main
 The process of recording Jaidev's statement will continue on Wednesday as well

 " Friendship has many dimensions and many dimensions
 yah ek aisa rishta he, jise samajha kam or mahasoos zyada kiya ja saktaa he
 The world is celebrating friendship today, in such a situation, we have noticed that on those relationships, which are considered as examples of friendship in the country, krishna-sudamadosti knows no wall, no difference is understood
 krishna-sudama kii mitrataa bhi hamen yahi sikh detii hai
 When years of childhood meet, Krishna becomes the king of Dwarka and Sudama is poor
 lekin iske baavjood krishna, sudama se aise milte hai, jaise unki mitrataa ke bina bhagwaan swayan kuch nahinram-hanumanbhakt or bhagwaan ke bich prem kah lijie yaa mitrataa, ramcharitamanas main bhagwaan ram or unke bhakt hanuman ke bich aisa rishta dikhaa, jo abhootpurv he
 Be it the service of Shriram, the task of saving Lakshmana or crossing the sea to meet Mother Sita, Hanuman did everything for Shriram
 or jab seenaa chirakar dikhaaya bhi ki unke hriday main bhi bhagwaan hi based hankern-duryodhanamahabharat kaa zikr hota he, to hamaara dhyaan kaurav-pandavon ke bich kurukshetra main lade gaye yuddh par jaataa he, lekin isamen karn or duryodhana kii dosti bhi rekhaankit kii ja sakati he
 It is said that Duryodhan, who did not shed a tear on the death of his brothers, wept bitterly as Karna left
 or karn ne mitrataa nibhaane main koi kasar nahin chhodipita or putrayun to ham main se zyaadaatar bachapan main maa kii tulana main pita se kuch darate bhi hai or jhijakte bhi hai
 But with increasing age and understanding, one realizes that there is no better and mature friend than father
 ham unase apane man kii har baat kah sakate hai or wo unhen samajhate bhi hai, kyonki yahi chizein wo pehle khud anubhav kar chuke hanma or betikuch isi tarah kaa talmail maa or beti ke bich bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 We are not doing that the love between mother and son is less, but the level of mutual cooperation between mother and daughter is amazing
 aksar dekhne ko miltaa he ki kai baar bete mata-pita kaa itnaa khyaal nahin rakh pate, jitna betiyaan rakhi paati hai
 Great friendship! We will not break friendship
 
 
 beete kareeb 40 saal se yah gaanaa dosti ko samajhane-samajhane kaa zariyaa bana hua he
 Whether to make a decision towards goodness by hoisting a coin or to save a friend by putting his life at stake, Jai and Veeru are taught to befriend and maintain us despite being criminals
 tom and jeriham sabhi ne bachapan main yun to kai aise cartoon dekhen honge, jinamein dosti bhi hogi or rishte bhi
 But Tom and Jerry do not get such a wonderful relationship, who keep fighting throughout the day, but get together when shared problems arise
 saath rahen, to laden or alag rahen, to bor ho jaaen
 In reality, aren't friendships and friends similar? Tom and Jerry Joe is hidden in all of us
 ham or ishwaror akhir main hamaare sabase kareeb or sabase bade dost kaa zikr
 God, God, Jesus
 
 
 koi naam de lijie, uuparavaala ek hi he
 And when we are in trouble, we often go to this friend
 or wo hamaari himmat bhi badhaata he or hausala bhi detaa he, taaki mushkil se ladakar dobaaraa khadey ho saken
 In happiness, we boast of our ability and put our heads to failure
 lekin wo kabhi bura nahin maanata

 a strange case of a fatwa against a Muslim person by a madrasa in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh has come to light
 madrase ne vyakti ke khilaaf isliye fatwa jari kar diya kyonki vyakti ne mrityu ke baad apana puraa sharir daan karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Director of Rama Dental College, Dr
 arshad mansuri ke khilaaf jari fatwa main madrasa ne kaha he ki angadaan avaidh or gaiyr-muslim kaary he

 Even after death our body has the right to Allah and for any reason donating it is un-islamic
 mrityu ke baad puure sammaan ke saath shav ko dafnaaya janaa chahie
 The fatwa issued by the madrasa states, "organ donation is illegal and un-islamic and is against the will of Allah
 " fatwa kaa samarthan karte hue madrasa ke ek anya maulavee mufti hanif barkati ne kaha ki manushya kaa sharir allaah kii sampatti he, yahaan tak ki maut ke baad bhi
 Sharia also says the same and no one can interfere in it
 fatwa jari hone or dhamkiyaan milane ke baad dow
 Arshad filed a police complaint

 The cornea can last well for 300 years and God has the same wish that after death we should be able to work for someone
 saath hi dow
 Arshad said he would not back down from his decision

 This pain will last him all his life
 apane man par raktranjit ghaav liye pavilion tak kaa lanbaa rasta tay karne ke kuch hi minute baad shokmagn dressing room main pahunchakar viraat kohli kaa ek nayaa rup khil uthaa
 He had batted like a champion and now, like a commander, began to add courage to his teammates
 dressing room main vah apane saathiyon se kah rahaa tha ki unke saamne do raste hai yaa to ve apni peeth thapthapaaen or pehle test ke paanchaven din gajab ke javaabi hamale ke liye naitik jeet kaa daawa karen yaa phir yah pataa lagane kii koshish karen ki jeet kii dahalij par aakar unke kadam kyon ladkadaa gaye
 It was clear that Kohli was inciting him to focus his mind on a more restless alternative
 dressing room main kohli ke is sawaal par kisi ke munh se ek shabd nahin niklaa, kisi ne palak tak nahin jhapakaai
 The team, coaching staff and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who were out of Test due to injury, were also seeing that Yuvraj has played the bugle of his coronation

 The rise of Kohli as captain means a great generational change in Indian cricket and he has already indicated to his teammates that they should be ready for a big cultural change ahead
 usne saaf kah diya he ki unhen australia kii tarah khelnaa or muqabla karnaa hoga or videshon main test match jeetne honge
 In India's first match as a full-time Test captain, Kohli dropped Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara from the fourth Test squad in Sydney

 One of the country's most successful captain Saurabh Ganguly told Sydney, "it will be Kohli's team

 His tone is sharp (after all, West Indies' Chris Gayle and England's Kevin Pietersen are among Kohli's best friends) and so far no season of the game has been hotly contested by Australian players

 In his 33rd Test, Kohli may not have touched the heights of greatness but he is taking a quantum leap towards him
 test cricket main uski shuruyaat beshak dhimi rahi
 He scored just 76 runs in the first five innings
 lekin chauthe test kii pehali pari ke baad se 10 shatak maar chukaa he
 This means every 3
 3 test main ek shatak he
 This ratio is slightly behind the same period of Sunil Gavaskar's career but far ahead of Tendulkar or Rahul Dravid
 sidney main pehali pari ke shatak ne kohli ko aisa pehla captain bana diya he jisane shikhar par rahete hue apni pehali teen pariyon main shatak jade hai
 Kohli had indicated that he would reach the peak in the cricket world even before playing his first Test

 "but the path was not always easy for Kohli
 vah 9 saal kii umr main jab pashchim dilli main rajkumaar kii koching academy main pahunchaa tha to hameshaa sharaarat karata rahata tha
 In the next four years, he improved his game so much that Delhi scored the most runs in the Under 14 League
 itane shandaar khel ke baavjood jab vah dilli kii under 14 team ke liye nahin chunaa gaya to use bada jhatka laga tha
 Rajkumar, who was a Ranji player himself, proudly told, "he cried a lot but worked twice as hard instead of giving up
" do saal baad jab dilli kii under 17 team main khelaa to do dohare shatak maare
 Kohli stepped into the Ranji Trophy match for Delhi at the age of 18 in 2006
 uske pakke iraadon kii pehali jhalak us samay mili jab ek din pehle pita kii mrityu ke baavjood vah karnataka ke khilaaf apni bachi hui pari aage khilne maidan par utar aayaa
 In the same mood, he scored 90 runs, saved the game for Delhi and walked from the grounds for the father's funeral with tears in his eyes
 malaysia main 2008 main youth worldcup main vijeta bharat kii under 19 team kaa netritv karne ke baad vah mukhya chayankarta dilip vengsarakar kii najar main chadh gaya

 usne srilanka main ekadivasiy match main bharat ke liye salaami ballebaaj ke rup main apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii jabaki vah club maichon main bhi kabhi opening karne nahin aayaa tha
 And then he lost his way
 sabko uske ravaiye or aisho-aaraam kii jindagi kii chahat se phikr hone lagi
 Playing for Vijay Mallya's flamboyant Royal Challengers team in the Indian Premier League, he froze in Bengaluru

 Rajkumar admitted, "he was derailed and my role turned to elder brother rather than his coach
 main use fatkaar lagaataa tha
 Had to follow him and always kept saying, practice, practice
 haalanki is tarah post or haarane ke baad use phir ehsaas ho gaya ki cricket hi uski ekmaatr praathamikta he or anushaasan tathaa lagan uske sabase achche dost hai
 Gradually, he found a rhythm and inspiration also returned to his mind
 ’’nae sire se team main vaapasi ke fouran baad kohli ekadivasiy cricket main bharat kaa mukhya aadhaar ban gaya
 After scoring his first Test century in Adelaide in 2012, he began to try his hand in Test cricket too

 Today, Kohli is being counted among such batsmen in world cricket, which scared the batsmen the most
 purv captain kapil dev ne kohli ko tab pahachaanaa tha jab vah bengaluru main neshnal cricket academy ke diarector the
 Kapil Dev feels that the new Indian captain has all the qualities, "he is an intelligent cricketer
" jab ballebaaji karata he to aisa lagata he ki dimag main compass or jeb main calculator lekar aayaa he
 He has a natural instinct to attack and i am glad that he has recovered so well from the lethargy of England
 ’’bharat ke ek or safal captain mohammad ajaharuddin kaa maananaa he ki kohli kii captaini kaa team par acha asar padegaa
 But Azhar also warns Kohli, "one, he has to keep his temper on the field and avoid confrontation with opponents
" duusare, agar team ne acha pradarshan nahin kiya to uski ballebaaji par asar pad saktaa he kyonki captaini kaa tanaav baari hota he
 Kohli's next stop is the World Cup
 2011 main vishwacap ke apane pehle match main usne shatak maaraa tha
 He had said the most memorable line after India won the World Cup
 usne tendulkar ke liye kaha tha, ‘‘unhone varshon tak desh kii ummiido ko uthaae rakhaa
 Now it's time for us to carry them on our shoulders

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Bagan and Yangon on Thursday, the last day of his visit to Myanmar
 yangun kii yatra ke dauraan vah bharat ke aakhri mughal badshaah mirza abu jafar sirajuddin mohammad bahadur shah jafar yani bahadur shah jafar kii majaar par bhi gaye
 Let me tell you that most of the people traveling to Myanmar, especially Indians, Muslims and people interested in royalty, definitely visit the dargah of Bahadur Shah Zafar
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi 2012 main bahadur shah jafar kii dargah par gaye the
 Why is Zafar's dargah special? The last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar died in a prison in Rangoon (now Yangon), the then capital of Burma (now Myanmar) in 1862, but his dargah was built in 1994 after 132 years
 is dargah kii ek-ek eent main aakhri badshaah kii jindagi ke itihaas kii mahak aati he
 This dargah has a separate place of prayer for women and men
 british shashan main dilli kii gaddi par baithe bahadur shah jafar nammaatr ke badshaah the
 However, Bahadur Shah Zafar is less known as a king and more as a poet and ghazal writer
 unki kitni hi najmon par baad main filmi gane bane
 His dargah is counted among the world's famous and historical dargahs
 kyon jafar ko nammaatr badshaah kii oopaadhi di gai?1837 ke sitambar main pita akbar shah dwitiya kii maut ke baad vah gaddinshin hue
 Akbar Shah II did not want to hand over the rule of Mughals for centuries to poet Hriday Zafar
 saundaryanuragi bahadur shah jafar kaa shasankaal aate-aate vaise bhi dilli sultanate ke paas raaj karne ke liye sirf dilli yani shahjahambad hi bachaa rah gaya tha
 The revolt of 1857 made Zafar a soldier of independence In 1857, the British captured almost the whole of India
 britishon ke akraman se tilamilaae vidrohi sainik or raja-maharaajaaon ko ek kendriya netritv kii jarurat thi, jo unhen bahadur shah jafar main dikhaa
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also accepted leadership in the fight against the British
 lekin 82 varsh ke buudhe shah jafar antat jang haar gaye or apane jivan ke aakhri varsh unhen angrejon kii kaid main gujaarne pade
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's arrest came as the end of the Mughal Empire
 400 saal se bhi zyada kaa chalaa mughal samrajya ab khatm ho chukaa tha
 Bahadur Shah, a top-class poet, was a poet of the poet Hriday Bahadur Shah Zafar shero-shayari from Zafaratbiyat and two of the top poets of his court, Mohammad Ghalib and Zouk, are still ideal for poets
 jafar khud behtareen shaayar the
 His lions in pain lived in a world of deep truths and feelings of human life
 rangoon main angrejon kii kaid main rahete hue bhi unhone dheron gajalen likhin
 As a prisoner, he was not even given a pen, but Zafar, the emperor of the Sufi saint, wrote ghazals on the wall with burnt matchsticks
 "din zindagi ke khatm hue shaam ho gaifaila ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main""kitna he badanaseeb 'jafar' dafn ke liedo gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main"aisa kaha jaataa he ki bahadurshah jafar mrityu ke baad dilli ke mahrauli main qutubuddin bakhtiyaar kii dargah ke paas dafn hona chaahate the
 He had also identified two yards for this
 britishon ne bina taam-jhaam ke chupchaap jafar ko dafn kiyaburma main angrejon kii kaid main hi 7 november, 1862 ko subah bahadur shah jafar kii maut ho gai
 He was buried the same day near the prison at the Shvedagon Pagoda
 itnaa hi nahin unki kabr ke chaaron ore bans kii baad laga di gai or kabr ko patton se dhank diya gaya
 The British did not want to give much rites to the funeral of the last emperor of the Mughals who ruled India for four decades
 vaise bhi burma ke muslimon ke liye yah kisi badshaah kii maut nahin balki ek aam maut bhar thi
 Davis, the British officer who was overseeing Zafar's funeral at the time, also wrote that some 100 people were present when Zafar was buried and that it was the same crowd, like horse racing or traveling to Sadar Bazaar
 jafar kii maut ke 132 saal baad saal 1991 main ek smarak kaksh kii aadharshila rakhane ke liye kii gai khudaai ke dauraan ek bhumigat kabr kaa pataa chalaa

 5 foot kii gaharaai main badshaah jafar kii nishaani or avshesh mili, jisaki jaanch ke baad yah pushti hui kii vah jafar kii hi hai

 hoicourt or supreme court ke jajon kii niyukti ke liye bane rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog yani engeesi banane ke centre sarkaar ne apane faisle ko sahi tehraaya he
 During the hearing in the five-judge Constitution Bench in the Supreme Court, the Central Government has argued that judicial review by Parliament cannot be judicially reviewed and Parliament is not bound to respond to its decision
 centre sarkaar kii ore se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne samvidhan peeth main bahes karte hue ki kaha ki jis tarah samvidhan ke adhyadesh 124 ko samajha gaya
 From him constitution maker Dr
 ambedkar kii aatma bhi pareshaan hogi, kyonki samvidhan main kahin bhi colegium system kii baat nahin he
 However, in the Constitution Bench hearing the case, Justice Chelameswar said that the government did not bring this new system because Dr
 ambedakar kii aatma pareshaan he, balki iske peeche kuch or kaaran he
 Rohatgi said that the independence of the judiciary starts only after the appointment of the judges and the judges have prominence in the new system
 agar teen main se do jaj kisi vyakti kii niyukti par sawaal uthaate hai to uski niyukti nahin ho sakati
 The petitioner's statement that this system will disturb the independence of the judiciary is not correct in any way
 unhone kaha ki 1993 kaa colegium system us vakt kii sarkaar ke ravaie kii vajah se bana kyonki us vakt sarkaar ne nyaaypalika ko bhi gherne kii koshish kii thi
 This hearing will continue
 is maamle main samvidhan peeth pehle bhi centre sarkaar par kai sawaal uthaa chuki he
 The comments isse pehle court ne sarkaar se poocha tha ki wo bataae ki nayaa system kis tarah colegium system se behatar he or isse nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal nahin padegaa
 If the government satisfies the court, then the court will accept this system
 isse pehle ayog ke banane ke baad supreme court main kai yachikaayen daakhil kii gai hai or kaha gaya he ki is ayog ko khatm kiya jaae
 The central government had earlier argued that the constitution bench of nine judges of the Supreme Court had framed the collegium system in 1993, so the matter should also be referred to a bench of 9 or 11 judges, but the court turned down the demand
 supreme court main paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth main sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne daleel di he ki sansad dwaara vivek se liye gaye faisle par nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati or sansad apane faisle ke liye jawaab dene ke liye baadhya nahin he
 On behalf of the Central Government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi argued in the Constitution Bench that the manner in which the Ordinance 124 of the Constitution was understood
 usase samvidhan nirmaataa dow
 Ambedkar's soul will also be troubled, because there is no talk of collegium system anywhere in the constitution
 haalanki is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi samvidhan peeth main justise chelmeshwar ne kaha ki sarkaar is nae system ko isliye nahin laai kyonki dow
 Ambedkar's soul is disturbed, rather there is some other reason behind it
 rohtagi ne kaha ki nyaaypalika kii aazaadee jajon kii niyukti ke baad hi shuru hoti he or nae system main jajon kii hi pramukhataa he
 If two out of three judges question the appointment of a person, then he cannot be appointed
 yachikakarta kaa ye kahana ki is system se nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal hoga, ye baat kisi bhi tarah se thik nahin he
 He said that the collegium system of 1993 was formed due to the attitude of the government at that time as the government also tried to surround the judiciary
 ye sunwaayee aage bhi jari rahegi
 In this case, the constitution bench has also raised many questions on the central government in the past
 tippaniyan Earlier, the court had asked the government to explain how the new system is better than the collegium system and this will not disturb the independence of the judiciary
 agar sarkaar court ko santusht kar detii he to court is system ko maan legi
 Earlier, after the formation of the commission, many petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court and it has been said that this commission should be abolished
 centre sarkaar ne pehle daleel di thi ki 1993 main supreme court kii nau jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne colegium system banaaya tha lihaaja is maamle ko bhi 9 yaa 11 jajon kii bench ko bheja janaa chahie, lekin court ne is maang ko thukraa diya tha
 However, in the Constitution Bench hearing the case, Justice Chelameswar said that the government did not bring this new system because Dr

 press council ke chairman justise katju or bijepi netaa arun jetali ke bich than gayi he
 Arun Jaitley is so upset with Katju that he has demanded his removal from the Press Council of India (PCI)
 jetali ne unpar gaiyr congressi rajyon se pakshpaat karne ke aarope madhe hai
 However, Justice Katju said while clarifying that he has never done any favor and he has remained firm on what he has said so far
 kya justise katju press council of india ke chair main bane rahane ke hakdaar nahin? kya justise katju siyaasi pakshpaat karte hai? kya justise katju gaiyr congressi rajyon par nishaanaa sadhate aae hai? ye sawaal uthe hai bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ke aaropon se
 Recently, Justice Katju wrote an article against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in a newspaper, BJP was upset
 arun jetali ne justise katju par pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue istipha maang liya
 Jaitley has written an article on the BJP website demanding that either Justice Katju resign from the post of Chairman of the Press Council of India himself or be removed
 jetali ne aarope lagaaya he ki justise katju kaa akhbaar main likhaa lekh puri tarah raajnneeti se prerit he
 It is also alleged that they are targeting non-congress states who have entrusted them with this important responsibility to make them happy
 jetali kii chitthee ke baad puri bijepi pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki justise katju ko gaiyr congressi rajyon main hin galtiyaan kyon dikhti hai
 Why his eyes do not go beyond Bihar, Gujarat and West Bengal
 bijepi ke tamaam hamalon ke baad bhi justise katju apane rukh par kaayam hai
 He claims that he has never said anything wrong nor done any favor
 jetali or bijepi ke aaropon ko niraadhaar bataaya or fasebuk maamle main maharashtra sarkaar kii khichai karne kaa hawala dete hue khud ko nishpaksh jataane kii koshish kii
 In fact, Katju, in an article written in a newspaper, criticized Narendra Modi and appealed to the people of the country to choose the Prime Minister carefully
 unhone modi ko gujarat dangon kaa gunahagaar tak tehra diya tha
 Earlier, the Press Council of India, headed by Justice Katju, issued a report accusing Bihar's Nitish Kumar government of crushing freedom of the press
 jaahir he ye tamaam baaten or justise katju kaa hamalaa bijepi ke gale nahin utar rahi he
 The eyes are on the 2014 election, the question is of the image
 bijepi ko maaloom he ki press council of india ke chairman kii baaten party or gathbandhan kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he shaayad yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne bhi sidhaa hamalaa katju kii chhavi par kiya he
