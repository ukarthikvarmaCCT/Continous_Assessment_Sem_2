 Recently on the last day of Prakash Utsav held in Patna, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad Yadav sat on the ground not on the stage
 is mudde par jari bavaal ke bich bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne is par somvaar ko safai di
 He said that the decision of who would sit where the committee of Takht Harmandir Sahib was made
 gurudware main koi kursi par nahin baithta, balki sab jameen par baithte hai
 Nitish said that some people of Bihar did not like the accolades received on Prakash Parv

 He advised such people to improve now in the press conference
 tippaniyan On the controversy related to the funding of the entire event, Nitish said that the state government has done all this with its ability
 sab kuch acchhee niyat or utsaah se kiya gaya isliye kaarykram safal hua, lekin nitish ne safal aayojan ke liye apane saare adhikario ko ek baar phir se badhai di
 However, Lalu Yadav, while speaking on this entire episode on Sunday, said that who is sitting where and where is sitting, it is not a matter of importance and he has no problem because it was not a political program but a religious program
 unki party ke purv saansad or varisht netaa raghubansh prasad singh ne is puure vivaad kii shuruyaat yah kahkar kii thi ki mahagathbandhan ke lalu yadav sabase varisht netaa hai or jameen par bitha kar unka apmaan kiya gaya he

 nitish ne kaha ki prakaash parv par mili vaahvahee bihar ke kuch logon ko acchhee nahin lagi
 This controversy reflects the view of a few people
 unhone samvaadadaata sammelan main aise logon ko ab sudharne kii salaah de daali

 His party's former MP and senior leader Raghubansh Prasad Singh started the whole controversy by saying that Lalu Yadav of the Grand Alliance is the most senior leader and he has been insulted by sitting on the ground
 vahiin bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel modi ne yah kahkar vivaad ko ek nayaa mode diya tha ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bheji gai suchi main lalu yadav kaa naam hi nahin tha or rajya sarkaar ko unhen manch par bithaane ke liye anumati leni chahie thi

 mani londring cese main naam aane ke baad ensipi ke mukhiya sharad pavaar (79) ne karaamaat dikhaate hue bijepi ko maat de di he
 Pawar, an old politician who has strengthened himself through experience and contacts
 apane grih rajya maharashtra jahaan chunaav hone ja rahe hai, pavaar ko chaar din pehle hi pravartan nideshaalay yani idi kaa notice mila
 To Pawar who is one of the prominent anti-bjp leaders in the state
 pavaar ko mili notice ke khilaaf ensipi ke kaaryakarta mumbai kii sadakon par utar aae
 (not Twitter whom the opposition chooses to stage these days) Fearful of this, ED officials sent an email to Sharad Pawar saying he was in no hurry to meet them
 lekin iskaa pavaar par koi asar nahin padaa or unhone kaha ki vah agency kaa sahyog karnaa chaahate hai or shuukravaar ko dopaher ke baad idi ke offis pahunch jaaenge
 After this, Pawar decently canceled the program of going to the ED office in view of the public appeal made in the name of Law and Order of the Mumbai Police Commissioner
 haalanki is bich bijepi kii shivasena sharad pavaar ke samarthan main aa gai he or idi ke notice ke 'badale kii raajnneeti' qaraar de daalaa
 Sena said 'ed's notice has once again given life to an opposition before the Maharashtra elections' and the score till yesterday evening was something like, Pawar-1 and BJP-0
 ab tak pavaar jinako piem modi ne ek baar 'raajnneetik guru' tak kaha tha, ubharne saken bijepi un palatwaar kar detii thi
 Sharad Pawar's nephew and Ajit Pawar, who holds the second position in NCP, is also named in the ed's case
 ajit pavaar ne vidhayak ke pad se istipha de diya he or iske baad se unase sampark nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Ajit Pawar, a five-time MLA, has also refused to talk to his uncle Sharad Pawar
 aisa lag rahaa he ki pavaar parivaar main jhagadav bijepi ke chalate ab khule taur par saamne aa gaya he
 Sharad Pawar tried to do a lot of damage control and said that his nephew and former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra has taken revenge politics against his uncle to heart, so he left politics and returned to old business and farming Has decided
 lekin ore jahaan sharad pavaar ekta dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe the to duusari ore se ajit pavaar ke bete parth pavaar ne hi unki is baat kaa khandan karte hue rahaa kiunke pita raajnneeti nahin chhod rahe hai
 Parth gave a twist to the whole case, saying that his father had told him before joining politics that it was a 'dirty business'
 'pavaar banaam pavaar' ke jhagade bijepi ke ek varisht netaa aage badha rahe hai jinke sampark main is samay ajit pavaar hai
 Actually the reality is that Pawar's nephew has taken to heart the ongoing succession battle in the party
 sutron kaa kahana he ki chachaa or bhattije ke bich pichley 6 mahise koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 Ajit Pawar is also angry that the NCP is trying to show Sharad Pawar as a clean leader and his name has been wrongly named in the ED case even though no such campaign is being conducted for him
 ek ore jahaan sharad pavaar guuruuvaar ensipi ke kor group ke netaaon se ghire the or khud kaaryakartaaon ke pradarshan kii nigaraanee kar rahe the to duusari ore ajit pavaar kii gaiyr-maujuudagi sabakaa dhyaan khinch rahi thi
 Along with this, Sharad Pawar talked to many leaders of the opposition including Congress
 congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne unke samarthan main twit bhi kiya
 Pawar also spoke to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 lekin is puri kavayad main vipaksh kii netaaon kii ore se ajit pavaar kaa naam tak nahin liya gaya
 Sharad Pawar publicly stated that this would be his last election
 isse pehle ajit pavaar hi sharad pavaar ke uttaradhikari the
 But Ajit Pawar's many absurd statements angered his uncle
 is dauraan sharad pavaar kii putree supriya sule raajnneeti main apana kad badhaati raheen
 There was an attempt to show unity in the family in public but differences were deepening inside
 sharad pavaar ke pote rohit pavaar kii raajnneeti main pravesh ne ajit pavaar ko ek baar phir apaset kar diya
 Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana also praised Rohit Pawar's attack on Amit Shah
 jaisaa ki maharashtra main chunaav najadik hai, raajnneeti ne shuru main hi paariwarik peshey kaa rup le liya he
 While the Shiv Sena has tied up with the BJP on the condition that Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray be made the deputy chief minister (first i gave this report to NDTV)
 haalanki bijepi hameshaa kii tarah pehle hi isko lekar chaukanni thi
 Ajit Pawar's resignation was decided as soon as Sharad Pawar returned
 jivan kii sabase badi ladaai lard rahe sharad pavaar par ab sab kuch nirbhar ho gaya he
 He always boasted that he himself had not lost any election and this family fight was very personal

 Sushma Swaraj welcomed Naresh Aggarwal to the BJP by tweeting, but he has dismissed his remarks on Jaya Bachchan as unacceptable and incorrect
 sushamaa swaraj ke baad smriti irani or roopa ganguli ne bhi naresh agarwal ke bayaan par virodh darj karaayaa he
 The party had to give cleanliness, after the ruckus on the statement of Naresh Agarwal, the BJP had to face the disgrace, then the party had to give clarification
 party pravaktaa sambit paatra ne morcha sambhala or party kaa stand clear karte hue kaha ki bijepi sabhi logon kaa sammaan karti he

 In the last month of 2014, when Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya was announced to be conferred with the 'bharat Ratna', a wave of joy raged in Benaras, and this was a major reason that Benaras became the first district in the country where Seven celebrities living in or associated with it have been conferred with 'bharat Ratna', the highest civilian honor of the country, i
e
 in other words it can be said that Banaras has become the 'city of Bharat Gems'
 is sammaan ko paane vaali banaras kii ye vibhutiyaan koun hai, yadi is par nazar daalen to na sirf hamen banaras kii ganga-jamuni tahjeeb kii jeevantata pataa chalati he, balki ghaaton ke shahar kahe jane vaale banaras main gyaan-vigyaan or sangeet kii triveni ke hone kaa ehsaas bhi pukhta ho jaataa he
 
 
 The award of 'bharat Ratna' to the dignitaries of Banaras started with the establishment of this honor
 pehali baar varsh 1954 main jin teen vibhootiyon ko is sammaan se nawaaza gaya tha, unamem banaras hindu uniwarsity ke varsh 1939 se 1948 tak vaais chancelar rahe sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhi shaamil the, or uske baad se yah silsilaa chal niklaa
 xxrep 50 - xxrep 41 - xxrep 91 - In the year 1955, this honor was conferred on Bhagwan Das, who was a great thinker, thinker, educationist and philosopher, born on January 12, 1869 in the Sah family in Benares
 bhagwaan das kii likhi darjanon kitaaben unke gyaan kii gavaahi detii hai
 Very few people would know that Bhagwan Das, along with Madan Mohan Malaviya, laid the foundation of Banaras Hindu University on the one hand, on the other hand he also founded Kashi Vidyapeeth
 unhone ani besent ke saath theosophical sosayadi kii shuruyaat main bhi bhoomika nibhaai
 His great-grandson Sameerkant says, "dada ji was a great philosopher, wrote many books, was a great educationist, founded Central Hindu School, he was the Founder Chancellor of Kashi Vidyapeeth, he also has a separate section in BHU Library
 
 
 
 " After this, Lal Bahadur Shastri of Benaras, who gave the slogan of 'jai Jawan Jai Kisan' to the country in 1966, was honored with 'bharat Ratna'
 bahadur shatri kaa ghar banaras ke ramnagar main hai
 It is said that he was a very good swimmer and often used to swim across the Ganges during his studies
 desh ke duusare pradhanmantri rahe bahadur shatri kii saadagi or eemaandaaree kaa puraa desh kaayal he
 After 1966, a long gap passed, and the wait came to a halt when Pandit Ravi Shankar, born in Benaras and who set the world ablaze with his sitar, received the honor in 1999
 haalanki pandit ravishankar ne america kii naagarikta le lee thi, lekin unka banaras se naata bana rahaa
 Almost immediately thereafter, in 2001, Ustad Bismillah Khan was awarded the 'bharat Ratna', but that honor was more for his 'magical blow'
 
 
 darasal, vaadyayantra shehanai dashakon tak shubh avasaron par logon ke gharon kii choukhat par bajataa aa rahaa tha, lekin ustad bismillah khan ne usamen aisi phoonk maari ki vah logon kii dyodhi se uthakar angan main bajane laga, lihaaza vah sammaan ustad bismillah khan kii us 'jaadui phoonk' ko mila tha
 After the year 2001, Banaras had to wait 12 years for the next 'bharat Ratna', and in 2013, the wait ended as soon as the renowned chemist CNR Rao was honored
 vaise, sienaar raav banaras main nahin janme the, lekin banaras hindu uniwarsity unki karmbhumi rahi thi
 
 
 
 or phir agle hi saal, yani varsh 2014 main banaras ke jis shaks ko 'bharat ratna' se nawaaza gaya, vah kisi oopaadhi yaa 'ratna' kahe jane se bahut bade hai, kyonki vah to swayan 'mahaamanaa' the
 Well, of late, but everyone is happy to be given the 'bharat Ratna' to Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya, although we believe that 'mahamana' should have got this honor at the start
 baharhaal, mahaamanaa ko 'bharat ratna' die jane ke saath hi banaras desh kaa pehla aisa shahar ban gaya, jisaki saat-saat vibhutiyaan 'bharat ratna' hai
 Experts say that the spread of the variations of Kashi is such that 'bharat Ratna' cannot live without visiting this city
 banaras hindu uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar girish chandra treepathi kehete hai, "chaahe vah shiksha kaa kshetra ho yaa vigyaan kaa, chaahe sangeet kaa ho yaa raajnneeti kaa, samaaj kii pahchaan sunishchit karne vaale sabhi aayam pracheen kaal se hi kaashi main the, bich main bhi rahe, or aaj bhi kaashi main inaki sankhya paryaapt he, jo isaki samskruti kaa sangrakshan karne main sakasham hai

 elahabaad hoicourt ne uttar pradesh ke bijanour jile kii ek adaalat ke andar hui hatya ke maamle main buudhvaar ko swat: sangyaan liya he
 The court has sought a reply from the Director General of Police (DGP) and the principal home secretary till 20 December
 adaalat ne rajya sarkaar se jila adaalaton ke liye apni suraksha yojana banane ke liye bhi kaha he
 a bench of Justice Sudhir Aggarwal and Justice Sunit Kumar said that the government should formulate a security plan for the court premises
 is bich rajya sarkaar ne laaparvaahee ke liye 19 police karmiyon ko nilambit kar diya he, jis kaaran adaalat kaksh ke andar hatya hui
 It is noteworthy that on Tuesday, an under trial person was killed and another was seriously injured when three persons were shot dead inside the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Bijnor district
 adaalat kaa ek clerk munish bhi is golibari main ghayal ho gaye, jabaki sijeem ko bhi khud ko bachaane ke liye bhaagna padaa
 The assailants surrendered inside the court after committing the murder
 khabaron ke mutabik, jab yah ghatana ghatit hui, us samay sijeem bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke netaa ehsaan or unke bhattije shaadaab kii hatya se jude maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 Shahnawaz and Jabbar, accused in this double murder case, were brought for hearing by the Delhi Police, who arrested them a few months back
 police adheekshak sanjeev tyaagi ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki maare gaye ehsaan ke bete sahil apane do doston ke saath adaalat pahunche or shahanvaj or jabbaar par andhadhundh goliyaan chalaani shuru kar di
 About 20 rounds were fired by him
 shahanvaj kii maukey par hi maut ho gai, lekin jabbaar maukey se faraar ho gaya
 The police immediately surrounded the courtroom and the attackers could not escape, after which they handed themselves over to the police
 pichley kai nadisutra nadiyon kii jindagi par uthte sawaalon par aadhaarit the
 Adiganga, Ramganga, Ganga itself, Gomti
 
 
 in sabhi nadiyon main pradooshan or nadiyon se sara pani khinch lene kii hamaari pravriti ne desh bhad kii nadiyon ke astitv par gambhir prashn khadey kar die hai
 Then a question was shown in the Kaun Banega Crorepati on which river Ganga of the south is called Obviously, many of us will know the answer to this
 par is sawaal ke bainks kai or sawaal khadey hote hai ki agar godavari dakshin kii ganga he to purv yaa pashchim kii gangaaen bhi honi chahie? yaa phir kitni nadiyaan hai jinke naam ganga se milte julate hai?maine is bare main kuch pramanik lekhan karne vaale vishashagyon or jaankaron kaa likhaa padhaa
 Then i thought that we will talk about pollution in the river, but you should also tell some interesting things that you can get a little glimpse of the culture of the rivers, the civilization that grew up on its banks and our heritage and history
 ab inhen samagriyon se mujhe pataa chalaa ki desh kii kai nadiyaan aisi hai, yaa kam se kam unke naam aise hai ki ekaadhik soobe main unki maujuudagi he
 For example, Parineeta Dandekar writes that we all know the existence of a single river named Dhauliganga
 par sachaai yah he ki uttarakhand main hi do dhauligangaayen hai
 The first, which flows into the Mahakali basin and the second into the upper Ganges basin
 dandekar likhti hai ki dhauliganga hi kyon, kaali, kosi or ramgangi kii bhi dupliket nadiyon ke astitv hai
 If we go into the history of naming rivers, you will also get new and different information about the lost and forgotten civilizations, the history and geography of this region
 par in nadiyon ke bare main khojbin karnaa utana aasaan bhi nahin he
 In this post maybe i can share some information about the names of some rivers
 chhathi kaksha ke itihaas kii kitaab main hi hamen yah padhaa diya jaataa he ki duniya kii mahaan sabhyataaen nadi ghaatiyon main viksit hui hai
 The name of its Hindustan, or Bharat or India, is also named after the river itself
 inds ko hi len, yah puraane irani shabd hindu se niklaa he
 Because the Aryans used to call the river flowing there as Sindhu (i
e
 Sea)
 yah shabd sanskrit kaa he or sa kaa uccharan na kar paane vaale shakadweep (iran) ke logon ne is nadi ke parali taraf rahane waalon ko hindu kahana shuru kar diya
 There is no determination of the sex of the river Indus in the Rigveda's Nidistuti Sukta, but the rest of the rivers are female
 dandekar likhti hai, pashto bhashaa main sindhu, abasin yaa pitru nadi he jise ladakhi bhashaa main senge chhu yaa sher nadi bhi kehete hai
 It is amazing that even in Tibet, this river is called Sunga Jangbo, it also means Lion River and both words are Pulling
 nadiyon kaa ling nirdhaaran kaa bhi ajeeb chamatkaar he
 Most of India's rivers (also called tribal names) are mostly feminine
 saath hi, bhartiya samskruti main kuch nadiyon ko puling bhi mana gaya he
 Its great example is the Brahmaputra
 dandekar, dhimaan dasgupta ke hawaale se likhti hai ki brahmaputra kii mul dhara yaralang jangbo bhi puling he
 Similarly, its major tributary is Lohit
 pashchim bengal main bahane vaali adhiktar nadiyaan, mayurakshi ko chhod den to, purush naam vaali hi hai
 For example, Damodar, Rupnarayan, Barakar, Barakeshwar, Ajay, Pagla, Jayapanda, Gadadhari, Bhairav and Navpatra
 sawaal he ki in nadiyon ke naam adhiktar purushon ke naam par hi kyon rakhe gaye?dandekar, dasgupta ke hawaale se likhti hai, ki in nadiyon kaa swaroop amuman vidhvansaatmak hi rahaa he
 Therefore they must have been given the names Pulling
 chaliye thodaa uttar kii taraf, satluj kii misaal lete hai
 Its Vedic name is Shatadru
 shat matlab sau, dru matlab raste
 That is, a river flowing through hundreds of paths
 ek seminar main kabhi sahityakar kaaka sahib kalelkar in in nadiyon ko mukt veni yaa yukt veni (baalo kii chotii se sandarbh) kaha
 When the discussion of hair has gone, Hiranyakeshi, the river flowing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, remembers the name
 hiranya matlab sona hota he
 Understand how the golden aura of this river will glow in the rays of the sun
 adivasee paramparaon main bhi amuman nadiyon ke naam puling hi milte hai
 Weddings in Sikkim sing the love of the Rangit (male) river and the Ragenyu (female, nickname Teesta) rivers
 kahani he ki ye do premi nadiyaan mount khaanchengadjonga kaa aashirwad lene pahaado se neeche utari thim
 To show the way to Rangit, a bird was flying forward and while a snake was showing the path to Ranganyu
 ranganew ne saanp kaa aadaa-tirachha sarpila rasta pakadaa or maidaanon main pehle pahunchakar rangit (tista) kii raah dekhne lagi
 The ghostly bird led the way to Rangit, who strayed up and down the path
 use aade main der ho gai
 According to the Sikkimese folklore, Rangit, being a man, felt very bad when he saw Ranganyu first waiting
 iske baad, ranganew ne rangit ko bahut manaaya-dulraya ki der se aada uski galati nahin thi
 Then go and consider color
 aisi hi ek kahani chandra or bhaaga kii bhi he, jo milakar chandrabhaga nadi banaate hai
 This Chandrabhaga is also called Chenab on one side
 par yah kahani himachal pradesh ke lahaul spiti ghati kii he
 According to folklore, Chand's daughter Chandra, who originates from Chandra Tal, loved a river called Bhaga
 bhaaga bhagwaan surya kaa betaa tha
 He comes out of Suraj Tal
 in donon ne faisla kiya ki ve baralachhaala darre tak jaaenge or vipareet dishaao se hokar waapas aaenge phir tandi main milakar vivaah kar lenge
 Chandra reached the tandi eating force when Bhaga's path was not so easy
 bhaaga ko nahin paakar chandra chintit ho gai or vah use khojane ke liye waapas phir kelong tak chali gai
 Chandra saw, Bhaga was trying to make his way through a deep moat

 The changed ground reality is that Nitish cannot make any request of BJP and especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi beyond a limit
 haalanki janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he nitish kumaar kaa kadam unke raajnneetik swabhaav ke anuroop tha ki chit bhi meraa or pat bhi meraa
 On one hand, by protesting in the speech, he made himself stand with them on the boil in the Muslim community on this issue, while leaving the house before voting, he also gave a message to the BJP that when we need you, at least from our side you will face difficulties
 not have to
 bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne pita lalu yadav ko chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad kaha ki ye sab raajnneetik shadyantr he
 Tejashwi said that the entire BJP has fallen behind his father Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ko pichhadon-daliton kii aawaaj uthaane ke chalate pareshaan hona pad rahaa
 Lalu is not an individual but an ideology
 hoicourt khulne kaa intjaar, karenge apiltejasvi ne kaha lalu yadav ko doshi qaraar dene kaa loar court kaa faisla tha
 When the High Court opens, we will challenge this decision
 aaj jo faisla hua he usamen puri tarah se bijepi or nitish kumaar lage hue the
 They wanted to somehow harass Lalu Yadav, put him in jail and defame him
 ye final jajment nahin he
 We can go to the High Court and then the Supreme Court against this decision
 die cese main loar court ne hamaare paksh main jajment diya tha
 Against this, the CBI went to the High Court and the Supreme Court, but there they dared to face it
 ham bhi is faisle ke khilaaf aage kii adaalat main apil karenge
 The entire party is standing behind Lalu Yadav
 There is no evidence against Laloo ji
 20 saal se ye cese chal rahaa he, lekin abhi tak koi thos saboot nahin he
 We are all united
 jo shaktiyaan desh ko todna chaahati hai, jo saamaajik nyaay ko nahin maananaa chaahati hai, ham uske khilaaf hai
 The only fault of Lalu ji was that he came from a backward caste
 unhone saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai ladi
 That is why not only Lalu Yadav, but our entire family has fallen behind
 gujarat rigelt kaa intjaar kar rahi thi bjpbijepi-aresas ko sabase zyada dar lalu prasad yadav kaa he
 Tejaswi said that you should see his activities since the result of Gujarat
 isi kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 There was no activity before the Gujarat result
 ab rigelt aate hi ye log na sirf hamaare parivaar ke balki vipaksh ke kai netaaon ke peeche pad gaye hai
 The people of Bihar have made up their mind to look into the technical aspects of the Judgment
 ab ye log kahin nahin tikne vaale hai
 The entire party and workers stand firmly with Lalu ji
 lalu ji ek vyakti nahin, vichaardhaara kaa naam he
 Lalu Yadav is a leader carrying secularism and social justice
 hamen puraa yakeen he ki lalu ji ko bel milegi
 We have problems only because the court is closed
 jajment padhane par kuch or takneekee pahaluon par ham dhyaan denge
 We are not going to lose our morale
 samjhauta kar letaa to main mukhyamantri hotaaye puri sajeesh he
 We did not compromise with ideology, if we had done it, we would have been the Chief Minister of Bihar today
 nitish kumaar ne apni vichaardhaara ko bech diya
 On the question of getting bail to Jagannath Mishra, Tejashwi said how Nitish Kumar was acquitted in the creation scam if Lalu ji is convicted in the fodder scam
 abhi logon ko ye to pataa hi nahin he ki bihar ke khajaane main se kitne rupee nikaale ja chuke hai
 Nitish knew that the case of the scam cannot be made while Lalu was in 1977, but all those before 90 were acquitted
 jisane isaki jaanch kaa aadesh diya, usee ko doshi qaraar diya gaya
 Nitish Kumar was to become the Chief Minister of Bihar
 ve yah baat bakhubi jaanate the ki lalu yadav ke rahete aisa nahin ho saktaa
 That is why a political conspiracy was hatched
 unhen badnaam kiya gaya
 Shivanand Tiwari has also said that he gave the statement only at the behest of Nitish Kumar
 14 taarikh ke baad logon ke bich jaaengebihar main 14 taarikh ke baad ham har jagah jaakar logon ko sachai bataaenge
 These people want to hide the truth
 log kehete hai ki party ab tuutegi
 But it has been going on since 1977 but not now
 party tuuti nahins balki pehle se or majboot hui he
 We are the largest party in Bihar
 bihar ke pehle vidhansabha chunaav main bhi argedy sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi
 The public is our boss, will suffer all the trouble
 janata ke dil main lalu yadav basate hai
 We will withstand any problem
 lekin antim paaedan par khadey vyakti ko jab tak mukhyadhara main nahin laaenge, hamaari ladaai jari rahegi
 Jaitley's statement reiterated that these are not the final decisions
 Joshi Yadav quoted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's statement that when the decision on 2G came, he said that it is not the final decision
 to ham bhi yahi kah rahe hai ki yah antim nirnay nahin he
 We trust the judiciary
 kya 80 lakh ke liye siem ghotaalaa karegaa?itane saalon se jaanch chal rahi he, lekin aaj tak ham logon ke paas ek paisa bhi zyada nahin mila
 The CBI also filed a case in DA for 45 lakhs
 kya ye itani badi rakam he ki uske liye ghotaalaa kiya jaae
 If the CM misuses the post, then he can earn millions of crores
 80 lakh ke liye kyon karegaa
 Referring to the Vyapam scam and the creation scam, Tejashwi said that these people can make anyone bleed to get power
 jo mahatma gandhi kaa khun kar sakate hai, wo kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 That's why Lalu Yadav's security was reduced
 is puure raajnneetik shadyantr kaa sirf ham hi nahin balki puri bihar kii janata jawaab degi

 ' In view of the displeasure of the Dalit community, the Narendra Modi government of the Center has decided to bring the SC / ST Act to the old and original form
 buudhvaar ko cabinet kii baithak main SC / ST act sanshodhan vidheyak ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di gai
 It is believed that the government will again restore the original provisions of the Act by introducing this amendment bill in this monsoon session
 bataa den ki isi saal 21 march ko supreme court ne anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium (essi / asti act 1989) ke tahat darj maamalon main tatkaal giraftaar par roak laga di thi
 The court ruled that the arrest of government employees can be done only after the permission of the competent authority
 supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf do april ko dalit sanghathan sadakon par utre the
 The Dalit community shut down 'bharat Bandh' on April 2
 centre sarkaar ko virodh kii aanch main jhulasna padaa
 There was violence in many areas in the Dalit movement across the country, in which a dozen people died
 supreme court ke faisle ke liye modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanate hue dalit samaaj centre sarkaar se apni naaraazgi jataa rahaa tha
 The central government and the BJP were said to be anti-dalit
 dalit sanghathanon ne sarkaar ko ek baar phir ultimatum de rakhaa he ki agar 9 agast tak essi asti act ko puraane swaroop main laane vaala kanoon nahin bana to wo bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan karenge
 In view of the displeasure of the Dalits, the Modi government decided to bring the SC / ST Act to its original form
 sarkaar is sanshodhan vidhyak ko laati he to wo paas hokar rahegaa
 Nobody is going to oppose the Dalit opinion
 phir ye apane mulswarup main aa jayega or supreme court ke pherbadal kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 After the amendment bill, these will be the sources, if the SC / ST Amendment Bill 2018, Section 18A will be added to the original law
 iske jariye puraane kanoon ko behaal kar diya jayega
 In this way, the provisions of the Supreme Court will be canceled and now this provision will be made - there is a provision for arrest as soon as the case is registered in the SC / ST Act - the accused will not be able to get anticipatory bail, regular bail can be obtained from the High Court itself
 -essi / asti maamle main jaanch inspector rank ke police afasar karenge
 - a complaint will be registered immediately on the complaint related to the use of descriptive words
 -essi / asti maamalon kii sunwaayee sirf special court main hogi
 - The investigating agency will not have to take permission from the authority before filing a charge sheet against the government employee in court
 supreme court ne kiya tha ye badlaav-essi / asti act ke maamalon main turant giraftaar nahin kii jaaegi
 - a lawsuit will not be filed immediately if a complaint is received
 sabase pehle shikaayat milane ke baad dspi str ke police afasar dwaara shuruaati jaanch kii jaaegi
 In any case, check should not be more than 7 days
 dspi shuruaati jaanch kar nateeja nikaalenge ki shikaayat ke mutabik kya koi maamla banataa he yaa phir kisi tareeke se jhuthe aarope lagaakar fansaaya ja rahaa he?-supreme court ne is act ke bade paimaane par galat istemaal kii baat ko maanate hue kaha tha ki is maamle main sarkari karmchaaree agrim jamaanat ke liye aavedan kar sakate hai
 When the accused is accused of using the word caste under the SC / ST Act, he had to review the reasons for the arrest before deciding to extend the custody of the accused
 -sarkari karmchaariyon kii giraftaar sirf sakasham athurity kii ijaajat ke baad hi ho sakati he
 - Officers who violate the guidelines, will also face departmental action and contempt of court proceedings
 lekin ab modi sarkaar vidheyak ke jariye is faisle ko palatney ja rahi he or isse essi / asti apane mul swaroop main aa jayega
 Former Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson recounts the old days of how the long friendship between him and all-rounder Shane Watson started
 johnson ne bataaya he ki edilade main cricket academy main jab donon prashikshan le rahe the, tab watson ne ek baar unka sir toilet se takaraa diya tha
 Johnson hit Watson's head with a toilet in 2000
 Rodney Marshathe, the academy at the academy, and luminaries such as Ian Chappell, Dennis Lillee and John Inverity, came to train him
 johnson bataate hai ki is dauran vahaan sabhi log'nevars' natakadekhene ke liye ikttatha hote the or bich main vigyaapan ke dauraan kushti ladate the
 Johnson wrote in his biography 'resilient', 'every night before dinner we all used to gather in one room to watch the drama' Never '
 jab bhi naatak ke bich main vigyaapan aata tha to sabhi kushti ladane lagate the or yah tab tak chalata tha jab tak naatak dobaaraa shuru nahin hota tha
 'johnson opened up to his title as many Rajjonsons write,' One day during wrestling, some boys pulled me and led me to the door and then someone had hit my head in the toilet
 mujhe yah pasand nahin aayaa
 i somehow redeemed my head and caught the shirt of what came before me

 ' pakistan main buudhvaar ko hone vaale aam chunaav ke liye prachaar tham chukaa he
 Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah may no longer be an issue in these elections, but his name has been in the limelight in India
 kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se mangalvaar ko sansad ko bataaya gaya he ki mumbai sthit ‘jinna house’ ko ‘shatru sampatti’ ke taur par soochibaddh nahin kiya gaya he
 In response to a question asked in the Lok Sabha on behalf of Karnal MP Ashwini Kumar, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir said, 'mohammad Ali Jinnah's residence does not come under the purview of the Enemy Property Act, 1968
 jinna house bharat sarkaar kii sampatti he or iske nistaaran kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 'ahir clarified that Jinnah House is an' evacuee property 'which comes under the ambit of the evacuee property act, 1950
 jinna house 2010 se kanoonee vivaad main fansaa hua he
 Jinnah's only child Dina Wadia had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court claiming this valuable property
 dina wadiya ne yachika main kaha tha ki ve jinna kii iklauti vaaris hai isliye sampatti par unhen adhikaar milanaa chahie
 The two-and-a-half-acre bungalow on Malabar Hill was claimed to have been given its title to Jinnah's sister Fatima Jinnah
 dina wadiya kaa 2 november 2017 ko neuyork main nidhan hua
 Significantly, this bungalow built by Jinnah was acquired by the government as Evacuee Property
 aise ivacui or anya ke bangale par saare adhikaar khatm ho gaye
 In the past, BJP leaders have been demanding that Jinnah House be declared 'enemy property'
 ivacui kaa arth hota he- ‘koi vyakti jo bharat or pakistan samprabhutaaon ke astitv main aane ke dauraan yaa naagarik gadabadiyon yaa aisi gadabadiyon ke hone ke dar se chhod kar chalaa gaya ho yaa 1 march 1947 ko yaa uske baad bharat ke antargat aane vaale kshetra se baahar chalaa gaya ho yaa pakistan ke kisi bhi hisse main rah rahaa ho
 For this reason, that person will not be entitled to occupy, monitor or manage property located in any area covered by the Evacuee Act
 do maheene pehle hi pakistan ke sansthaapak jinna kealigarh muslim uniwarsitike chaatrasangh ke haul main lage potrate ko lekar jamkar vivaad hua tha
 The rightists were demanding removal of Jinnah's portrait
 aligarh se bijepi saansad satish gautam ne is sambandh main aligarh uniwarsity ke kulapati ko chitthee bhi bheji thi
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill is a dangerous bill
 yah bill bhartiya raashtra rajya kii mul avadharana par chot karata he
 It ridicules the preamble that gives every Indian citizen the right to equality of all kinds irrespective of religion, caste, language or any discrimination
 kyonki yah bill pehali baar dharm ke aadhaar par kuch logon ke liye naagarikta kaa prastaav karata he, or isi aadhaar par kuch logon ko baahar rakhe jane kii baat karata he
 This law is an attempt to change the DNA of this country
 nishchay hi kisi raashtra ke bheetar yah samvedansheeltaa zaruri he ki agar koi vaid kaarnon se sharan maange to use sharan di jaae
 After Independence, on this humanitarian basis, India not only gave shelter to the Dalai Lama, but also gave him a place for exile government
 aisi sharan ke liye raajnneetik ichha shakti chahie, koi nayaa kaanoon nahin
 But the law that the government is bringing will have a provision to give citizenship to those illegal migrants who will be Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain or Zoroastrian
 agar kisi vaid vajah se- kisi bhi tarah ke utpeedan se trast- koi muslim yah sharan chahta he to use nahin milegi
 For this, the time period of the year 2014 has been fixed
 yani 2014 se pehle jo log avaidh pravasi hai, unako yah naagarikta milegi, lekin kya isi ko aadhaar banaakar aane vaale dinon main bhi aise pravasi sharan nahin chahenge?yah bill pesh karne vaali sarkaar or bijepi se jude saansadon kaa tark ajeeb he
 He says that there are many countries for the remaining religions, India is only for Hindus
 yah kisi raajnneetik dal kaa nahin, kisi dharmik samooh kaa tark lagata he
 Then there are cracks in this argument as well
 hinduon ko duniya ke kis desh main jagah nahin mil rahi he? sachai yah he ki aaj kii tarikh main bhartiya log duniya ke sabase bade pravasi hai- yani unhen sabase zyaada duusare deshon main naagarikta mil rahi he yaa vahaan unke aavedan pade hai
 According to the figures released by the United Nations Population Branch recently, about twenty five million Indians are living in other countries
 jaahir he, inamen bahut badi taadaad hindu bharatiyon kii hi he
 After India, Mexico is the second country whose citizens are in other countries - but only ten million
 china or peeche he
 Syria, also known for its refugee compulsions, is behind this case
 to yah tark ki hinduon ko kis desh main jagah milegi, ek safed jhooth or bhaavnaatmak bhayadohan se zyada kuch nahin he
 Indians are going around the world and finding a place
 america main green card kaa aavedan dene waalon main bhi sabase badi taadaad bharatiyon kii he
 Look at the religion of these Indians, it will come to know that a 'hindu-made nation' like India is a choice or a liberal America which has so far stayed away from such discrimination
 sharnaarthi samasya duniya bhar kii samasya rahi he
 Many people are fleeing to the countries of Europe, beset by wars and conflicts in West Asia
 myanmar main sataae gaye lakhon log bangladesh se lekar bharat tak main thikaana khojate rahe
 There are many illegal settlements of these Rohingya Muslims in India as well
 apane gharon, apni bastiyon or apane shaharon se ujde aise log jab anjaan mulkon main daakhil hote hai to ve aise bebas log hote hai jin par sirf dayaa kii ja sakati he
 There are other aspects of this refugee problem in the Indian subcontinent
 bangladesh ke ghuspaithiyon ko lekar assam main baqayada andolan chal padaa or maujuuda rashtriya naagarikta register usee kii parinti he
 Of course, there should be a national policy on such refugees in which there can be proper inclusion of human interests along with national interests
 yah niti bananaa aasaan kaam bhi nahin he
 But instead of doing this difficult work, the government is bringing in such a citizenship bill which will make the situation somewhat odd
 bharat main ek puure samudaay ke bheetar yah sautelepan kaa bhav paidaa karegaa
 If this bill had talked about the minorities of Sri Lanka, Nepal or Myanmar, apart from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, it would have been more just and much closer to the Indian sentiment
 is kaanoon kaa ek khatara or he
 Hindus living in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan should not be vulnerable
 unase yah na kaha jane lage ki unka to ek desh ho gaya- unako to hindustan kii naagarikta mil rahi he- ve yahaan kya kar rahe hai
 Actually, this entire bill would bring this subcontinent closer to the days of 1947 when a country was divided into two and citizens were being asked to choose their country on the basis of religion
 tab is desh ne hindu mulk hona nahin chunaa tha- kyonki vah is desh ke hazaron saal ke itihaas se gaddari hoti
 It would have been a fake country like Pakistan today
 lekin kya yah baat un logo ko samaj main aegi jo is desh ko ek hindu pakistan main badalane par tule hai? a coaching center in Sarathana, Surat, died in a fire that left 20 children dead and many more injured

 Former Army Chief General VK Singh said on Thursday that the decision to run Operation Blue Star to wipe out terrorists from the Golden Temple in 1984 was a "hasty political decision"
 aaparishan ke samay major rahe general singh ne daawa kiya ki sena is oparation ko anjaam dene ko anicchhuk thi
 He said that the decision to send the army to the Golden Temple was taken in haste as the army never liked to pick up guns against its own people
 unhone tatkaaleen senadhyaksh (general eyes vaidya) kaa naam liye bina kaha, ‘‘tatkaaleen sena pramukh ne desh ke hi logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye joardaar dhang se ‘naa’ kah diya tha lekin unhen apane raajnneetik aakaaon ke aadesh kaa paalan karnaa padaa

 March will pass through Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and West Uttar Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki ‘aise galat nirnyon’ se naa keval sena balki desh ke log bhi prabhavit hote hai
 General Singh, who was the major at the time of the operation, claimed that the army was reluctant to carry out this operation
 unhone kaha ki swarna mandir main sena bhejne kaa nirnay jaldbaaji main liya gaya tha kyonki sena ko apane hi logon ke khilaaf bandook uthaanaa kabhi pasand nahin tha
 Without naming the then army chief (general AS Vaidya), he said, "the then army chief had emphatically said 'no' to take action against the people of the country but he had to follow the orders of his political masters
 
 tippaniyan General Singh came here for a meeting from March 31, before the march started under the banner of 'janloktantra Morcha'
 march punjab ke baad haryana, rajasthan or pashchim uttar pradesh se gujaregaa
 He said that 'such wrong decisions' affect not only the army but also the people of the country

 The Shiv Sena has started a new discussion on the issue of terrorism through its mouthpiece 'saamana'
 somvaar ko chape sampadakeey main party ne 'bhagava aatankwaad' ko khaarij karte hue likhaa he ki bharat main aatankwaad kaa sirf ek hi rang he or vah he haraa
 In the article, while attacking the Congress, it has been written that the Congress has raised the slogan of Hindu terrorism in the country and this has benefited Pakistan
 saamanane likhaa he, 'aatankwaad kaa koi jati athwa dharmik rang nahin hua karata
 But the color of terrorism in India is green
 pakistan kii tulana main is hare aatank ko kahin zyada paalane-posane kaa kaam congress netritv vaali upie sarkaar ne kiya
 Congress has raised the slogan of Hindu terrorism in the country
 congressiyon kii hindu aatankwaad kii raajnneeti ne pakistani shadyantra ko bal diya
 Praising Rajnath Shiv Sena, in his article praising Home Minister Rajnath Singh, wrote that he attacked this sincerity of UPA government tremendously
 shivasenaka daawa he ki samjhauta express main hue visphot or maalegaanv bam cond kaa aarope hindutvvaadiyon ke sir madha gaya he or is tarah hindu aatankwaad kii bijuka congress or unke bagal bacchon ne khadaa kiya he
 Shiv Sena has further written that the Congress government has strengthened the hands of Pakistan in a way to prove its statue to be secular and fair
 saamana ne likhaa he, 'congress dwaara aatankwaad ko bhagava rang dekar hindustan main dharmaandh voton kii raajnneeti karnaa kutil or matlabi daanv tha
 In the dishonesty with the country, it has been written that Pakistan-sponsored green terrorism was exposed by proving Hindus to be terrorists and it was dishonest with the country
 saamana ne likhaa he, 'ye hindu raashtra he
 There is no reason to spread terrorism to Hindus in this Hindu nation
 aatankwaad ko dharm kaa rang dene vaale desh ke dushman hai
 Rajnath Singh has done the work of showing them the mirror
 'shivasena ne yah bhi likhaa he ki desh main muslim yuvakon ke dimag garam kar unhen islam yaa jihad ke naam par aatankwaadi krity main durupyog karne kaa kaam pakistan kiya karata he

 The accident in Ghazipur in East Delhi on Friday evening has raised many questions
 lekin haadase ke liye sabase bada jimmedaar agar koi he to wo he dilli nagar nigam yani emsidi
 Because that is what happened for a long time
 saalon se ek time bam kii tarah khadi gajipur leadphil site shuukravaar ko fat padi or landphil site kaa ek hissaa shuukravaar ko ek jatke ke saath neeche aa gira
 There was traffic on the road right from the landfill site and vehicles and people passing through it were hit
 haadase main do logon kii maut hui or 4 ghayal ho gaye
 The next morning of the incident, the Aaj Tak team tried to find out who was responsible for the incident and all the fingers were seen pointing towards the MCD
 jab haadase par najar daalenge to paaenge ki is haadase ko roka ja saktaa tha lekin emsidi ke deele dhaale ravaiye ne ek aisi durghatana kar di jisane sari dilli ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Let us tell you that Ghazipur landfill site was started in 1984
 anumaan ke mutabik ise saal 2002 tak ke liye hi banaaya gaya tha
 This landfill site should have been closed in 2002, but the waste continued to be dumped at the landfill site for 15 years after the expiry of the term, which has reached a height of 50 meters today, with a clearance of just 20 meters
 aisa nahin he ki iske liye nigam ko chetaya nahin gaya tha
 The Delhi Pollution Control Committee, ie DPCC, had written a letter to the East MCD several times warning that no more garbage should be added to Ghazipur, but the LCD will not be littered on the ear
 laaparvaahee kii ek or kahani aapako bataaenge to aapako bhi yakeen ho jayega ki kyon iseemsidi kii badi laaparvaaheemana jayega
 In fact, the land in Delhi provides DDA and as an alternative to the Ghazipur landfill site, East MCD has also been given consent for about 150 acres of vacant land of DDM in Ghonda Gurjan in East Delhi and on September 4, East MCD officials And the meeting of the mayor with the DDA officers is also fixed, but see the irony, the cost of not being able to build a landfill site here at the time is due to the loss of two people
 Not so
 teesaribadi laaparvaaheebhi aapako bataate hai
 
 
 In November last year, the East MCD signed an agreement with the National Highway Authority under which garbage from the Ghazipur landfill site was to be used for diversion of NH-24
 lekin yojana qaraar se aage naa bad saki
 Ultimately, the administration has lost sleep after two deaths
 haadase ke agle din yani shanivaar ko uparajyapal ne purvi dilli ke kamishnar or adhikariyon ke saath-saath enechaeai afasaron ke saath baithak kii or tay kiya ki november 2017 se kooday ko landphil site se uthaakar enech-24 ke liye istemaal main laayaa jayega or agle do saalon main gajipur se kooday ke dher ko puri tarah khatm kar diya jayega
 Now the big question is that when this accident could have been stopped, then why was it delayed and now when two people have lost their lives, then unsuccessful attempts are being made to heal that fate
 lambey samay tak sainya shashan ke saaye main rahe or pichley kai varshon se aatankwaad evam hinsa kaa saamana kar rahe pakistan ke log kal apni agali loktantric sarkaar chunane ke liye matdaan karenge
 Along with the National Assembly, voting will be held for the assemblies of four provinces of Pakistan
 isi saal march main pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke netritv vaali sarkaar ke paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad 11 may ko chunaav karaane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 This will be the first time in the history of Pakistan when the transfer of power through elections will take place from one democratic government to another
 11 may ko matdaan khatm hone ke baad hi matganana shuru ho jaaegi or sabhi nattejey aane main ek saptaah se adhik kaa samay lag jaataa he
 The National Assembly, the lower house of the Pakistani Parliament, has a total of 342 members, but according to its constitution, 272 seats are held directly and 60 seats are reserved for women and 10 seats for minorities
 pratyaksh chunaav se mili siton ke anupaat main hi vibhinn dalon ko ye arakshit 70 siten aavantit kar di jaati hai
 To form a government, any political party or coalition needs to get at least 172 seats
 is baar ke chunaav main purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii pakistan muslim lig-navaj (piemail-en), raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari or bhutto parivaar kii pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) tathaa cricket ke maidan se siyasat ke maidan main utre imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke bich trikoniya muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 Apart from these major parties, parties like PML-Q, jamaat-e-islami and Awami National Party are also trying to strengthen their strength
