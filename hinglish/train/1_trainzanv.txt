 nagaland or tripura jal rahaa he
 Are you saying that the whole country is happy with this bill? He said that protests are taking place in most of the northeastern states
 assam main sena kii tukadiyaan tainaat kii ja rahi hai
 If everything is fine and people are happy with this bill then why is this happening? ye bhi ek fishan ho gaya he, lone liya to lone vebhar karo
 This is part of the statement that Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu has given in Mumbai
 kisaanon kii karz maafi faishan ho gaya he
 It has given a statement in Mumbai that his party's Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should not withdraw his decision of loan waiver if affected by it
 kisaanon kii karz maafi ko fishan kehane se pehle lagata he ki unhen upi chunaav kaa dhyaan nahin rahaa jab khud pradhanmantri kaha karte the ki hamaari sarkaar bani to uski cabinet kii pehali baithak main kisaanon kii karzmaafee hogi or yah baqayda bijepi ke ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa tha
 Venkaiah Naidu should have given this suggestion before the election
 upi or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko ve ab bhi kah sakate hai ki fishan band kiijie
 Debt waiver was the biggest decision as soon as the government was formed in UP
 maharashtra inkaar karata rahaa lekin kisaan andolanon ne mukhyamantri fadanvis ko majaboor kar diya ki karz maafee karen
 Punjab had to declare as the Congress had promised the people in the elections there
 phir karnataka se khabar ai ki vahaan bhi fasali rin maaf karne kaa elaan hua he
 Madhya Pradesh has also made a provision of 1000 crores by creating a loan waiver scheme
 9 saal pehle 2008 main upie sarkaar ne karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya tha lekin donon main antar he
 In 2008, the central government waived debts but this time the state governments are doing it
 vitt mantri jetali ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki karz maafee nahin karenge
 Let's see an account of how much was announced during the UPA and how many crores have been announced at this time
 - uttar pradesh ne 36,359 karod kii karzmaafi kaa elaan kiya he - Maharashtra has announced a loan of Rs 30,000 crore - karnataka ne 8,165 karod kii fasali rin maaf karne kaa elaan kiya he - 21000 crore loan waiver has been announced in Punjab but provision of 1500 crore only - telugana ne 17,000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya he - Andhra Pradesh has announced a loan waiver of 22000 crores - tamilnadu sarkaar ne 5,780 karod - Total of seven states is 140,304 crores rupees 2008 main upie ne 60,000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya tha
 The total loan waiver for 2016 and 2017 is around 1 lakh 40 thousand crores
 kahin bhi purna maafee nahin hui he
 Somewhere an announcement has been made, some work has been done after the announcement, somewhere the process is going on and somewhere the process has been made so complicated that there is no benefit from it
 bijness standard kii khabar ke anusaar telugana ne 17000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa vaada puraa kar diya he
 Andhra Pradesh had promised an amnesty of 22,000 crore, but according to the news of Financial Express, half the money was given to the banks
 kya aap jaanate hai ki kisaanon par karz kitna he
 In September 2016, the Minister of State for Agriculture had told in the Rajya Sabha that the farmers of India have a debt of 12 lakh 60 thousand crores till 30 September 2016
 inamen se 9 lakh 57 hazaar karod kaa karza vyavsaayik bainkon ne kisaanon ko diya he
 Out of 12 lakh 60 thousand crores, 7 lakh 75 thousand crores have been taken for loan crops
 tab purushottam roopala ne kaha tha ki sarkaar karza maaf nahin karegi
 The Reserve Bank has said that this will have a negative impact on debt collection
 12 lakh 60,000 karod kaa karza he or saat rajyon main maafee kaa elaan hua he ek lakh 40 hazaar karod
 How much it happened, only 12 percent
 kya 12 pratishat karz maafee kaa elaan fishan he
 There are four points in Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 pehla ki karzmaafee fishan hota ja rahaa he
 Secondly, loan waiver is not the final solution, no one says that loan waiver is the final solution
 teesraa bindu yah he ki kisaan ke haath main paisa kaise pahunche iske liye kya kadam uthaaya jaae to isaki samiksha unhen hi kerani chahie ki kyonki sarkaar unki he or sarkaar ne kadam to uthaaye hi honge
 The fourth point is that the loan waiver should be in the extreme situation
 ye extream sichuation yani charam sthiti yani antim avasthaa kya he
 On June 22, two farmers of Madhya Pradesh committed suicide
 sagar ke basaari gaanv ke kisaan guli kurmi par 8 lakh rupee kaa karz tha
 This farmer of 11 acres of land should have no reason to commit suicide due to debt
 lekin karz chukaate chukaate guli kurmi kii 5 acre zamin bik bhi gai
 Mahanaj's eyes were also on the 7 acres of land that was left
 zaahir he kisaan karz se dabaa hua tha or apni zamin nahin bachaa paa rahaa tha
 He had taken a loan of a tractor from the Central Bank, which was unable to pay its installment
 guli kii jeb se ek suicide note bhi mila he
 By listening to that letter, you can understand who are taking the lives of farmers
 3 bacchon ke pita guli likhte hai ki shankar baoodeniyaan maharaj ne dhokhadhadi se benama kara liyo
 The land was mortgaged, kept by interest
 ham inkaa byaaj dete rahe, hameshaa dete rahe, inaki niyat karaab hone lagi
 Jay started threatening us
 ham zamin par qabza kar lenge
 Took one lakh rupees, of which the money of the educated student was cut, out of one lakh, the rest reached 2 lakh 5 xxrep 4 0 rupees
 inkaa hamaara hisaab ho chukaa tha phir bhi je hamase or paisa maang rahe hai
 Willing to threaten to kill
 shankar pita parsaram shankar ne apni patni ke naam se likhaa-padhi kari thi, shankar maharaj patni kaa naam kamalabai he
 Dhannalal is ready to threaten to kill
 hamen kisi bhi prakaar se fansaa denge
 Usury charges 20 to 24 percent
 kisaanon ko zarurat kaa sara paisa bank se nahin miltaa he
 In Madhya Pradesh, 20 farmers have committed suicide in 15 days
 13 june ko madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne kaha tha ki pichley ek saal main sirf chaar kisaanon ne karz ke kaaran aatmahatya kii he
 These are the same ministers who said that farmers have not died from the police bullet, then three days later, they believed that they had died from the police bullet
 3 may ko supreme court main centre ne jo halafanama diya he usamen bataaya he ki 2015 main madhya pradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 Nowhere does it say that these farmers have not committed suicide due to debt, but have said that due to stress in agriculture, there is tension and the government is also trying to increase their income
 hamane mangalvaar ke prime time main madhya pradesh ke apane sahyogi anuraag dwari se poocha tha ki in mahajanon ke peeche zarur raajnneetik takat hoti hogi
 It should be properly investigated from whom the farmers are taking interest at 20 to 24 percent and who are those people
 kisaan bank se pareshaan he yaa in mahajanon ke changul se
 Budni is the name of the tehsil of Sihor district of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, where 55-year-old Shatrughan Meena committed suicide by consuming sulfas on the morning of 22 June
 parivaar ke log hoshangabad ke nijee aspataal bhi le gaye magar shatrughna ne dam tod diya
 According to family members, Shatrughan had a loan of one million
 apane khet main bijli kaa sthai conection lene ke liye ve 22 june ko tehsil karyaalay gaye
 It was found that the seven acres of land that they are considering as their own are not their names

 Son alleges that local BJP leader Arjun Malaviya has grabbed his land
 bijepi ke pravaktaa ne mana he ki arjuna malviya party ke netaa hai magar aarope kii jaanch honi chahie
 By the way, our colleague Anurag Dwari has also favored Arjun Malaviya
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan agar chahenge to aasaani se pataa kar sakate hai ki shatrughna meena kii zamin kisi ne apane naam kii he yaa nahin, agar kii he to tehsil karyaalay main koun koun log shaamil rahe hai
 The statement of the spokesperson is strange that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the BJP but his brother is a Congressman
 punjab ke tarantaaran main bhi do kisaanon ne 22 june ko khudakushi kii he
 Farmer Joginder Singh of Kot Sewya of Tarn Taran and Dalbir Singh farmer of Alowal village of Khadur Sahib village committed suicide

 Of this, five lakh loans were from the bank, two lakhs were taken from the stock and two and a half acres of land

 maafee kitne kii ho rahi he ek lakh yaa do lakh
 That too has been announced
 22 june ko chaar kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Shiv Sena has criticized Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 nikhil pandhi hamaare sahyogi hai
 He spoke to a farmer from Raila village of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab
 35 saal se kheti kar rahe hai
 It is said that the loan is increasing every year
 kheti kii laagat badhati ja rahi he
 The price is not available according to the cost
 parivaar main paanch log hai
 Two daughters and a son
 sabaki shaadi honi he lekin shaadi karne ke paise nahin hai
 Now they are considering giving up farming
 kehete hai ki ab kheti karuunga to kheti hi kisaan ko kha jaaegi, kisaan kya kheti se khaayegaa
 Jotdar Kanwal Singh of 6 Bigha carries a loan of 4 lakhs
 pichley saal ludhiana ke sahiban gaanv ke jasvindar singh ne apane paanch saal ke bete ko seene se lagaaya or nahar main kudakar jaan de di
 Jaswinder had a bank loan of one million
 dedh acre kii zamin thi
 Isn't this extreme situation? kya aise extream sichuation vaale kisaanon ke das lakh lone maaf karegi sarkaar? kahin bhi ek lakh yaa do lakh se zyaada kaa lone maaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Then how did it become fashion
 kai saal pehle maine raveesh kii report main bhivani se ek report kii thi vahaan kai aspataal mili jinke baahar likhaa tha zehar khaaye marizon kaa aspataal
 Today i got a picture of those hospitals from my colleague from Bhiwani
 ye astpal aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Outside a hospital, even spray is written, poison is also written
 kya aapane sulphas khaae marizon ke ilaaj ke astpal ke board dilli mumbai main dekhe hai
 There are different reasons for eating sulfas, but within them there is also an economic crisis within agriculture
 bharat kaa kisaan jaan bhi detaa he or laaj bhi bachaa lenaa chahta he
 a 2015 National Crime Branch Bureau report states that 162 people related to the farming sector in Haryana committed suicide and 28 farmers committed suicide
 thik he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ko bharosa he ki wo kisaanon ko dharm or jati main baant degi, or chunaav ke vakt kisaan khushi khushi bant bhi jate hai lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai
 Six farmers commit suicide every day in Telangana
 isi saal 3 may ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama diya he ki kheti ke sector main har saal 12000 kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 Is it not extreme circumstance to commit suicide of 12,000 farmers in a year? ab aate hai rajasthan kii ek khabar par
 The government makes a good joke with the poor
 main garib parivaar se hum or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium yani enegese ke tahat rashan letaa hum
 Beneficiary Rajbai, son, Prabhudayal, BPL number 641941
 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he
 It is not a case of that kind, yet while writing the poor outside the house of the poor one should think that he too has some dignity
 garib kaa bhi swabhimaan hota he
 One thing has to be understood that subsidy is not a bailout, nor a begging, but it is a right, which the government makes laws in Parliament, the cabinet decides when giving
 rajasthan main rashan card dharakon ko jab aadhaar se jod diya gaya he tab diwaar par likhane kii kya zarurat thi ki main garib hum
 Then close the base and write on the wall that i am poor and take ration
 tippaniyan This report of 201 was made by our former colleague Rubina Khan Shapu
 diwaar he madhyapradesh kii
 In the villages of Gopalganj here, the poor have been written on the wall without the approval of the family
 tab bheekhm ne rubina khan shapu se kaha tha ki apane ghar ke baahar is tarah se likhaa dekh pidaa hoti he
 Now everyone knows that we are poor
 beti kii shaadi hone main mushkil aegi
 When this thing came in the media, the administration deleted it
 magar anusuchit janajati ke log is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hue the kyonki unke saath pehali baar aisa nahin hua tha
 In the year of 2009, he also complained to the National Human Rights Commission that he was insulted by such trafficking
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar he magar 2008 main haryana main jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bhi rajya sarkaar ne faisla liya tha ki bipiel pariwaron kii deevaaron par bipiel number paint karegi
 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum

 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar he magar 2008 main haryana main jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bhi rajya sarkaar ne faisla liya tha ki bipiel pariwaron kii deevaaron par bipiel number paint karegi
 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum
 - Uttar Pradesh has announced a loan waiver of 36,359 crores - maharashtra ne 30,000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya he - Karnataka has announced to waive crop loans of 8,165 crores - punjab main 21000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan hua he magar praavdhaan 1500 karod kaa hi kiya - Telangana has announced a loan waiver of 17,000 crores - andhra pradesh ne 22000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya he - Tamil Nadu government 5,780 crores - saat rajyon kaa kul yoga hota he 140,304 karod rupaya In 2008, the UPA announced a loan waiver of Rs 60,000 crore
 2016 or 2017 kii karz maafee kaa kul yoga he kareeb 1 lakh 40 hazaar karod
 There is no complete apology anywhere
 kahin elaan hi hua he, kahin elaan hone ke baad aadha kaam hua he, kahin prakriya chal hi rahi he or kahin prakriya itani jatil kar di gai he ki usase kuch laabh bhi nahin
 According to the Business Standard news, Telangana has fulfilled its loan waiver promise of Rs 17000 crore
 aadhra pradesh ne 22,000 karod kii maafee kaa vaada kiya tha magar financial express kii khabar ke anusaar aadha paisa hi bainkon ko diya he
 Do you know how much the farmers owe
 sitambar 2016 main rajyasabha main krishi rajya mantri ne bataaya tha ki bharat ke kisaanon par 30 sitambar 2016 tak 12 lakh 60 hazaar karod rupee kaa karza he
 Of these, 9 lakh 57 thousand crores have been loaned by commercial banks to farmers
 12 lakh 60 hazaar karod main se 7 lakh 75 hazaar karod karza fasalon ke liye liya gaya he
 Purushottam Rupala had then said that the government would not waive the loan
 reserve bank ne kaha he ki isse karz vasuuli par nakaaratm asar padegaa
 There is a loan of 12 lakh 60,000 crores and forgiveness has been declared in seven states, one lakh 40 thousand crores
 yah kitna hua, maatr 12 pratishat
 Is 12 percent loan waiver declaration fashion
 venkaiya naidu ke bayaan main chaar bindu hai
 The first is that karzmafi is becoming fashionable
 doosraa ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan nahin he, ye koi nahin kahata ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan he
 The third point is that what steps should be taken to get the money in the hands of the farmers, then they should review it because the government is theirs and the government must have taken steps
 chauthaa bindu yah he ki karz maafee extream sichuation main honi chahie
 What is this extreme situation? 22 june ko madhya pradesh ke do kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Farmer Gulai Kurmi of Basari village in Sagar had a loan of Rs 8 lakh
 11 acre zamin ke is kisaan ke paas karz ke kaaran khudakushi karne kii koi vajah nahin honi chahie thi
 But 5 acres of Gullai Kurmi land paying the debt was also sold
 jo 7 acre zamin bachi thi us par bhi mahanaj kii nazar pad gai thi
 It is evident that the farmer was burdened with debt and was unable to save his land
 us par central bank se tractor kaa lone liya tha jisaki kisht nahin de paa rahaa tha
 a suicide note has also been found from Gulai's pocket
 us patr ko sunakar aap samaj sakate hai ki kisaanon kii jaan koun log le rahe hai
 The father of 3 children Gulai writes that Shankar Boudeniya Maharaj fraudulently got Benama done
 zamin girvee rakhi thi, byaaj dwaara rakhi
 We kept paying interest, always giving them, their intention started deteriorating
 hamako je dhamkee dene lage
 We will occupy the land
 ek lakh rupee liye jisamen se likhaa padhi ke paise kaate, ek lakh main se kaate, baaki 2 lakh 5 xxrep 4 0 rupaya pahunche
 We had been accounted for, yet Jay is asking for more money from us
 jaan maarane kii dhamkee dene ko taiyaar hai
 Shankar's father Parasrama Shankar wrote and read in the name of his wife, Shankar Maharaj's wife's name is Kamalabai
 dhannalaal jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dene ko taiyaar he
 Will implicate us in any way
 soodakhor 20 se 24 pratishat tak kaa byaaz vasuulate hai
 The farmers do not get all the money they need from the bank
 madhya pradesh main 15 din main 20 kisaanon ne khudakushi kii he
 On June 13, the Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh had said that in the last one year, only four farmers have committed suicide due to debt
 ye vahi mantri hai jinhone kaha tha ki police kii goli se kisaan nahin mare hai phir teen din baad mana ki police kii goli se mare hai
 In the affidavit given by the Center in the Supreme Court on May 3, in 2015, 581 farmers committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh
 usamen kahin nahin kaha he ki in kisaanon ne karj ke kaaran aatmahatya nahin kii he balki yahi kaha he ki kheti main sakant ke kaaran tanaav he or sarkaar unki aamadani badhaane kaa prayaas bhi kar rahi he
 In Tuesday's prime time, we had asked our Madhya Pradesh colleague Anurag Dwari that there would definitely be political power behind these mahajans
 isaki thik se jaanch honi chahie ki kisaan kin mahajanon se 20 se 24 fisadi par byaaz le rahaa he or wo koun log hai
 The farmer is upset with the bank or the clutches of these moneylenders
 budni mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke sihor zile kii tehsil kaa naam he, yahaan 22 june kii subah 55 saal ke shatrughna meena ne sulphas khaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Family members also took him to a private hospital in Hoshangabad, but Shatrughan died
 parivaaravaalon ke anusaar shatrughna par das lakh kaa karz tha
 He went to the tehsil office on 22 June to get a permanent connection to his farm
 vahaan pataa chalaa ki jis saat acre zamin ko wo apana maan rahe hai wo unke naam nahin he
 Just returned from there, ate sulfas and committed suicide
 bete kaa aarope he ki bijepi ke sthaneey netaa arjuna malviya ne unki zamin hadap lee he
 BJP spokesperson has admitted that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the party but the charge should be investigated
 vaise hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne arjuna malviya se bhi unka paksh liya he
 If Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan wishes, then he can easily find out whether anyone has owned Shatrughan Meena's land or not, if he has, then who are involved in the Tehsil office
 pravaktaa kaa yah bayaan ajeeb he ki arjuna malviya bijepi ke netaa hai lekin unke bhai congressi hai
 Two farmers have committed suicide on 22 June in the swimming pool of Punjab
 tarantaaran ke kot siwaya ke kisaan joginder singh or khadur sahib ke padate gaanv aloval ke kisaan dalbir singh ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Joginder Singh had a loan of seven lakhs
 isamen paanch lakh karj bank kaa tha, do lakh aadhati se liye the or dhai acre zamin thi
 Dalbir Singh also drank poison while sleeping at night
 dalbir singh ne 4 lakh aadhati se liye the
 Two lakhs were taken from other adalathas of Jalandhar
 ek lakh bank kaa karj tha or chaar acre zamin thi
 If a farmer is committing suicide at the age of sixty, it means that the farmer is in extreme situation
 karz kaa detail isliye bataaya taaki aapako pataa chale ki kisaan kahaan kahaan se karz le rahaa he
 How much is an apology for one lakh or two lakhs
 wo bhi elaan hi hua he
 On June 22, four farmers committed suicide
 shivasena ne venkaiya naidu ke bayaan kii aalochana kii he
 Nikhil Pandhi is our colleague
 unhone punjab ke fatehgarh sahib ke railon gaanv ke ek kisaan se baat kii
 Have been farming for 35 years
 kehete hai ki har saal karz badhata hi ja rahaa he
 The cost of farming is increasing
 jo laagat he uske hisaab se daam nahin mil rahaa he
 There are five people in the family
 do betiyaan or ek betaa
 Everyone has to get married but there is no money to marry
 ab ve kheti chhodane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 It is said that if i do farming now, farming will eat the farmer, what will the farmer eat from farming
 6 bigha ke jotdar kanwal singh par 4 lakh kaa karza he
 Last year, Jaswinder Singh of Sahiban village in Ludhiana stabbed his five-year-old son by chest and jumped into the canal and gave him life
 jasvindar par das lakh kaa bank lone tha
 There was one and a half acres of land
 kya ye extream sichuation nahin he
 Will the government waive one million loans of farmers with such extreme conditions? Nowhere is a loan of more than one lakh or two lakhs waived
 phir ye fishan kaise ho gaya
 Many years ago, i had made a report from Bhiwani in Ravish's report, found several hospitals outside which the hospital of poisoned patients was written
 aaj maine bhivani se apane sahyogi se un aspataalon kii tasviir mangai
 These astpals still exist today
 ek aspataal ke baahar to spray bhi likhaa he, zehar bhi likhaa he
 Have you seen Astpal's board in Delhi Mumbai for treating patients who have eaten sulfas
 sulphas khaane ke alag alag kaaran hai magar inke bheetar kheti ke bheetar kaa aarthik sankat bhi he
 The farmer of India dies and Laj also wants to be saved
 2015 ke rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report bataati he ki haryana main kheti ke sector se jude 162 logon ne aatmahatya kii or 28 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Well, the politics of India is confident that it will divide the farmers into religion and caste, and during the elections the farmers are happily divided but it is also a fact that suicides are happening
 telugana main har din chah kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 On May 3 this year, the central government has given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that every year 12000 farmers commit suicide in the farming sector
 ek saal main 12,000 kisaanon kaa aatmahatya karnaa kya extream sichuation nahin he
 Now come to a news of Rajasthan
 garib ke saath sarkaar hi acha mazaaq karti he
 i belong to a poor family and take ration under the National Food Security Act ie NFSA
 labhaarthi rajbai, putr, prabhudayal, bipiel number 641941
 The government says that many people had joined this scheme which was not entitled to BPL, hence it has been written
 dausa zile ke is gaanv main agar aap aaen or kuch gharon par aisa likhaa dekhen to kya aapke man ko thes nahin pahonchegi
 Well, you have started living in Delhi Mumbai but till a few decades ago, there was a ration item in your house too, think how would you feel if the government had written it out
 sarkaar apane record main hisaab rakhe, garib ke ghar ke baahar kyon likhaa gaya he ki main garib parivaar se hum or rashan letaa hum
 Our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh has told that in Dausa district there are 52,164 families BPL i
e
 people below poverty line
 sarkaar ne dedh lakh se adhik gharon ke baahar kii diwaar par main garib parivaar se hum likhva diya he
 i am not saying that writing like this is like that scene of the movie 'wall' in which Vijay's hand was written that my father is a thief
 us tarah kaa maamla to nahin he phir bhi garib ke ghar ke baahar garib likhte vakt itnaa to sochna chahie ki uski bhi kuch maan maryaada he
 The poor also have pride
 ek chiz samaj leni chahie ki sabsidi kairaat nahin he, na hi bheekh he balki yah adhikaar he jise dete samay sarkarein sansad main kanoon banaati he, mantrimandal main faisla hota he
 When the ration card holders in Rajasthan have been linked to Aadhaar, what was the need to write on the wall that i am poor
 phir aadhaar ko band kar diwaar par hi likhnaa chahie ki main garib hum or rashan letaa hum
 The comments ye report 201 kii he hamaari purv sahyogi rubina khan shapu ne kii thi
 The wall is of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan ke gopalganj ke gaanvon main parivaar waalon kii manzuri ke bina diwaar par garib likh diya gaya he
 Then Bhikham had told Rubina Khan Shapoo that it is painful to see this written outside his house
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya ki ham garib hai
 It will be difficult for the daughter to get married
 jab media main yah baat ai to prashasan ne ise mitaa diya
 But the Scheduled Tribes were very angry with this because it had not happened to them for the first time
 2009 ke saal main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat bhi kii thi ki is tarah kii nishandehi se unka apmaan hota he
 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have BJP governments, but even when the Congress was in Haryana in 2008, the state government had decided that BPL would paint BPL numbers on the walls of families
 us samay bhi khub vivaad hua tha
 The Minister of Panchayati Raj of Rajasthan said that the 2009 order of the previous Congress government was written under the same
 kamaal he 2013 se rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 This is the fourth year and the 2009 orders are coming into force
 ganimat he mantri ji ise sahi nahin maanate hai or hatwane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anyway, if the government has the same argument that the rich or those who are not poor take advantage of the BPL scheme, then it should be written on the wall of their houses that i am rich and take advantage of the BPL scheme
 2008 main upie ne 60,000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa elaan kiya tha
 The total loan waiver for 2016 and 2017 is around 1 lakh 40 thousand crores
 kahin bhi purna maafee nahin hui he
 Somewhere an announcement has been made, some work has been done after the announcement, somewhere the process is going on and somewhere the process has been made so complicated that there is no benefit from it
 bijness standard kii khabar ke anusaar telugana ne 17000 karod kii karzmaafee kaa vaada puraa kar diya he
 Andhra Pradesh had promised an amnesty of 22,000 crore, but according to the news of Financial Express, half the money was given to the banks
 kya aap jaanate hai ki kisaanon par karz kitna he
 In September 2016, the Minister of State for Agriculture had told in the Rajya Sabha that the farmers of India have a debt of 12 lakh 60 thousand crores till 30 September 2016
 inamen se 9 lakh 57 hazaar karod kaa karza vyavsaayik bainkon ne kisaanon ko diya he
 Out of 12 lakh 60 thousand crores, 7 lakh 75 thousand crores have been taken for loan crops
 tab purushottam roopala ne kaha tha ki sarkaar karza maaf nahin karegi
 The Reserve Bank has said that this will have a negative impact on debt collection
 12 lakh 60,000 karod kaa karza he or saat rajyon main maafee kaa elaan hua he ek lakh 40 hazaar karod
 How much it happened, only 12 percent
 kya 12 pratishat karz maafee kaa elaan fishan he
 There are four points in Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 pehla ki karzmaafee fishan hota ja rahaa he
 Secondly, loan waiver is not the final solution, no one says that loan waiver is the final solution
 teesraa bindu yah he ki kisaan ke haath main paisa kaise pahunche iske liye kya kadam uthaaya jaae to isaki samiksha unhen hi kerani chahie ki kyonki sarkaar unki he or sarkaar ne kadam to uthaaye hi honge
 The fourth point is that the loan waiver should be in the extreme situation
 ye extream sichuation yani charam sthiti yani antim avasthaa kya he
 On June 22, two farmers of Madhya Pradesh committed suicide
 sagar ke basaari gaanv ke kisaan guli kurmi par 8 lakh rupee kaa karz tha
 This farmer of 11 acres of land should have no reason to commit suicide due to debt
 lekin karz chukaate chukaate guli kurmi kii 5 acre zamin bik bhi gai
 Mahanaj's eyes were also on the 7 acres of land that was left
 zaahir he kisaan karz se dabaa hua tha or apni zamin nahin bachaa paa rahaa tha
 He had taken a loan of a tractor from the Central Bank, which was unable to pay its installment
 guli kii jeb se ek suicide note bhi mila he
 By listening to that letter, you can understand who are taking the lives of farmers
 3 bacchon ke pita guli likhte hai ki shankar baoodeniyaan maharaj ne dhokhadhadi se benama kara liyo
 The land was mortgaged, kept by interest
 ham inkaa byaaj dete rahe, hameshaa dete rahe, inaki niyat karaab hone lagi
 Jay started threatening us
 ham zamin par qabza kar lenge
 Took one lakh rupees, of which the money of the educated student was cut, out of one lakh, the rest reached 2 lakh 5 xxrep 4 0 rupees
 inkaa hamaara hisaab ho chukaa tha phir bhi je hamase or paisa maang rahe hai
 Willing to threaten to kill
 shankar pita parsaram shankar ne apni patni ke naam se likhaa-padhi kari thi, shankar maharaj patni kaa naam kamalabai he
 Dhannalal is ready to threaten to kill
 hamen kisi bhi prakaar se fansaa denge
 Usury charges 20 to 24 percent
 kisaanon ko zarurat kaa sara paisa bank se nahin miltaa he
 In Madhya Pradesh, 20 farmers have committed suicide in 15 days
 13 june ko madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne kaha tha ki pichley ek saal main sirf chaar kisaanon ne karz ke kaaran aatmahatya kii he
 These are the same ministers who said that farmers have not died from the police bullet, then three days later, they believed that they had died from the police bullet
 3 may ko supreme court main centre ne jo halafanama diya he usamen bataaya he ki 2015 main madhya pradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 Nowhere does it say that these farmers have not committed suicide due to debt, but have said that due to stress in agriculture, there is tension and the government is also trying to increase their income
 hamane mangalvaar ke prime time main madhya pradesh ke apane sahyogi anuraag dwari se poocha tha ki in mahajanon ke peeche zarur raajnneetik takat hoti hogi
 It should be properly investigated from whom the farmers are taking interest at 20 to 24 percent and who are those people
 kisaan bank se pareshaan he yaa in mahajanon ke changul se
 Budni is the name of the tehsil of Sihor district of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, where 55-year-old Shatrughan Meena committed suicide by consuming sulfas on the morning of 22 June
 parivaar ke log hoshangabad ke nijee aspataal bhi le gaye magar shatrughna ne dam tod diya
 According to family members, Shatrughan had a loan of one million
 apane khet main bijli kaa sthai conection lene ke liye ve 22 june ko tehsil karyaalay gaye
 It was found that the seven acres of land that they are considering as their own are not their names
 bas vahaan se laut kar sulphas kha lee or aatmahatya kar lee
 Son alleges that local BJP leader Arjun Malaviya has grabbed his land
 bijepi ke pravaktaa ne mana he ki arjuna malviya party ke netaa hai magar aarope kii jaanch honi chahie
 By the way, our colleague Anurag Dwari has also favored Arjun Malaviya
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan agar chahenge to aasaani se pataa kar sakate hai ki shatrughna meena kii zamin kisi ne apane naam kii he yaa nahin, agar kii he to tehsil karyaalay main koun koun log shaamil rahe hai
 The statement of the spokesperson is strange that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the BJP but his brother is a Congressman
 punjab ke tarantaaran main bhi do kisaanon ne 22 june ko khudakushi kii he
 Farmer Joginder Singh of Kot Sewya of Tarn Taran and Dalbir Singh farmer of Alowal village of Khadur Sahib village committed suicide
 joginder singh par saat lakh kaa karz tha
 Of this, five lakh loans were from the bank, two lakhs were taken from the stock and two and a half acres of land
 dalbir singh ne bhi raat ko sote vakt zehar pi liya
 Dalbir Singh had taken 4 lakhs of agents
 do lakh jalandhar ke duusare achhatiyon se liye the
 There was a loan of one lakh bank and four acres of land
 saath saal kii umr main koi kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he to iskaa matlab he ki kisaan extream sichuation main he
 The details of the loan were told so that you know where the farmer is taking the loan from
 maafee kitne kii ho rahi he ek lakh yaa do lakh
 That too has been announced
 22 june ko chaar kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Shiv Sena has criticized Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 nikhil pandhi hamaare sahyogi hai
 He spoke to a farmer from Raila village of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab
 35 saal se kheti kar rahe hai
 It is said that the loan is increasing every year
 kheti kii laagat badhati ja rahi he
 The price is not available according to the cost
 parivaar main paanch log hai
 Two daughters and a son
 sabaki shaadi honi he lekin shaadi karne ke paise nahin hai
 Now they are considering giving up farming
 kehete hai ki ab kheti karuunga to kheti hi kisaan ko kha jaaegi, kisaan kya kheti se khaayegaa
 Jotdar Kanwal Singh of 6 Bigha carries a loan of 4 lakhs
 pichley saal ludhiana ke sahiban gaanv ke jasvindar singh ne apane paanch saal ke bete ko seene se lagaaya or nahar main kudakar jaan de di
 Jaswinder had a bank loan of one million
 dedh acre kii zamin thi
 Isn't this extreme situation? kya aise extream sichuation vaale kisaanon ke das lakh lone maaf karegi sarkaar? kahin bhi ek lakh yaa do lakh se zyaada kaa lone maaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Then how did it become fashion
 kai saal pehle maine raveesh kii report main bhivani se ek report kii thi vahaan kai aspataal mili jinke baahar likhaa tha zehar khaaye marizon kaa aspataal
 Today i got a picture of those hospitals from my colleague from Bhiwani
 ye astpal aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Outside a hospital, even spray is written, poison is also written
 kya aapane sulphas khaae marizon ke ilaaj ke astpal ke board dilli mumbai main dekhe hai
 There are different reasons for eating sulfas, but within them there is also an economic crisis within agriculture
 bharat kaa kisaan jaan bhi detaa he or laaj bhi bachaa lenaa chahta he
 a 2015 National Crime Branch Bureau report states that 162 people related to the farming sector in Haryana committed suicide and 28 farmers committed suicide
 thik he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ko bharosa he ki wo kisaanon ko dharm or jati main baant degi, or chunaav ke vakt kisaan khushi khushi bant bhi jate hai lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai
 Six farmers commit suicide every day in Telangana
 isi saal 3 may ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama diya he ki kheti ke sector main har saal 12000 kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 Is it not extreme circumstance to commit suicide of 12,000 farmers in a year? ab aate hai rajasthan kii ek khabar par
 The government makes a good joke with the poor
 main garib parivaar se hum or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium yani enegese ke tahat rashan letaa hum
 Beneficiary Rajbai, son, Prabhudayal, BPL number 641941
 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he
 It is not a case of that kind, yet while writing the poor outside the house of the poor one should think that he too has some dignity
 garib kaa bhi swabhimaan hota he
 One thing has to be understood that subsidy is not a bailout, nor a begging, but it is a right, which the government makes laws in Parliament, the cabinet decides when giving
 rajasthan main rashan card dharakon ko jab aadhaar se jod diya gaya he tab diwaar par likhane kii kya zarurat thi ki main garib hum
 Then close the base and write on the wall that i am poor and take ration
 tippaniyan This report of 201 was made by our former colleague Rubina Khan Shapu
 diwaar he madhyapradesh kii
 In the villages of Gopalganj here, the poor have been written on the wall without the approval of the family
 tab bheekhm ne rubina khan shapu se kaha tha ki apane ghar ke baahar is tarah se likhaa dekh pidaa hoti he
 Now everyone knows that we are poor
 beti kii shaadi hone main mushkil aegi
 When this thing came in the media, the administration deleted it
 magar anusuchit janajati ke log is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hue the kyonki unke saath pehali baar aisa nahin hua tha
 In the year of 2009, he also complained to the National Human Rights Commission that he was insulted by such trafficking
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar he magar 2008 main haryana main jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bhi rajya sarkaar ne faisla liya tha ki bipiel pariwaron kii deevaaron par bipiel number paint karegi
 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum
 There is a loan of 12 lakh 60,000 crores and forgiveness has been declared in seven states, one lakh 40 thousand crores
 yah kitna hua, maatr 12 pratishat
 Is 12 percent loan waiver declaration fashion
 venkaiya naidu ke bayaan main chaar bindu hai
 The first is that karzmafi is becoming fashionable
 doosraa ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan nahin he, ye koi nahin kahata ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan he
 The third point is that what steps should be taken to get the money in the hands of the farmers, then they should review it because the government is theirs and the government must have taken steps
 chauthaa bindu yah he ki karz maafee extream sichuation main honi chahie
 What is this extreme situation? 22 june ko madhya pradesh ke do kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Farmer Gulai Kurmi of Basari village in Sagar had a loan of Rs 8 lakh
 11 acre zamin ke is kisaan ke paas karz ke kaaran khudakushi karne kii koi vajah nahin honi chahie thi
 But 5 acres of Gullai Kurmi land paying the debt was also sold
 jo 7 acre zamin bachi thi us par bhi mahanaj kii nazar pad gai thi
 It is evident that the farmer was burdened with debt and was unable to save his land
 us par central bank se tractor kaa lone liya tha jisaki kisht nahin de paa rahaa tha
 a suicide note has also been found from Gulai's pocket
 us patr ko sunakar aap samaj sakate hai ki kisaanon kii jaan koun log le rahe hai
 The father of 3 children Gulai writes that Shankar Boudeniya Maharaj fraudulently got Benama done
 zamin girvee rakhi thi, byaaj dwaara rakhi
 We kept paying interest, always giving them, their intention started deteriorating
 hamako je dhamkee dene lage
 We will occupy the land

 ye vahi mantri hai jinhone kaha tha ki police kii goli se kisaan nahin mare hai phir teen din baad mana ki police kii goli se mare hai
 In the affidavit given by the Center in the Supreme Court on May 3, in 2015, 581 farmers committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh
 usamen kahin nahin kaha he ki in kisaanon ne karj ke kaaran aatmahatya nahin kii he balki yahi kaha he ki kheti main sakant ke kaaran tanaav he or sarkaar unki aamadani badhaane kaa prayaas bhi kar rahi he
 In Tuesday's prime time, we had asked our Madhya Pradesh colleague Anurag Dwari that there would definitely be political power behind these mahajans

 BJP spokesperson has admitted that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the party but the charge should be investigated
 vaise hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne arjuna malviya se bhi unka paksh liya he
 If Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan wishes, then he can easily find out whether anyone has owned Shatrughan Meena's land or not, if he has, then who are involved in the Tehsil office

 Dalbir Singh also drank poison while sleeping at night
 dalbir singh ne 4 lakh aadhati se liye the
 Two lakhs were taken from other adalathas of Jalandhar
 ek lakh bank kaa karj tha or chaar acre zamin thi
 If a farmer is committing suicide at the age of sixty, it means that the farmer is in extreme situation
 karz kaa detail isliye bataaya taaki aapako pataa chale ki kisaan kahaan kahaan se karz le rahaa he
 How much is an apology for one lakh or two lakhs

 On June 22, four farmers committed suicide
 shivasena ne venkaiya naidu ke bayaan kii aalochana kii he
 Nikhil Pandhi is our colleague

 It is said that if i do farming now, farming will eat the farmer, what will the farmer eat from farming
 6 bigha ke jotdar kanwal singh par 4 lakh kaa karza he

 There was one and a half acres of land
 kya ye extream sichuation nahin he
 Will the government waive one million loans of farmers with such extreme conditions? Nowhere is a loan of more than one lakh or two lakhs waived
 phir ye fishan kaise ho gaya
 Many years ago, i had made a report from Bhiwani in Ravish's report, found several hospitals outside which the hospital of poisoned patients was written
 aaj maine bhivani se apane sahyogi se un aspataalon kii tasviir mangai
 These estuaries still exist today
 ek aspataal ke baahar to spray bhi likhaa he, zehar bhi likhaa he
 Have you seen Astpal's board in Delhi Mumbai for treating patients who have eaten sulfas
 sulphas khaane ke alag alag kaaran hai magar inke bheetar kheti ke bheetar kaa aarthik sankat bhi he
 The farmer of India dies and Laj also wants to be saved
 2015 ke rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report bataati he ki haryana main kheti ke sector se jude 162 logon ne aatmahatya kii or 28 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Well, the politics of India is confident that it will divide the farmers into religion and caste, and during the elections the farmers are happily divided but it is also a fact that suicides are happening
 telugana main har din chah kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 On May 3 this year, the central government has given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that every year 12000 farmers commit suicide in the farming sector
 ek saal main 12,000 kisaanon kaa aatmahatya karnaa kya extream sichuation nahin he
 Now come to a news of Rajasthan
 garib ke saath sarkaar hi acha mazaaq karti he
 i belong to a poor family and take ration under the National Food Security Act ie NFSA
 labhaarthi rajbai, putr, prabhudayal, bipiel number 641941
 The government says that many people had joined this scheme which was not entitled to BPL, hence it has been written
 dausa zile ke is gaanv main agar aap aaen or kuch gharon par aisa likhaa dekhen to kya aapke man ko thes nahin pahonchegi
 Well, you have started living in Delhi Mumbai but till a few decades ago, there was a ration item in your house too, think how would you feel if the government had written it out
 sarkaar apane record main hisaab rakhe, garib ke ghar ke baahar kyon likhaa gaya he ki main garib parivaar se hum or rashan letaa hum
 Our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh has told that in Dausa district there are 52,164 families BPL i
e
 people below poverty line
 sarkaar ne dedh lakh se adhik gharon ke baahar kii diwaar par main garib parivaar se hum likhva diya he
 i am not saying that writing like this is like that scene of the movie 'wall' in which Vijay's hand was written that my father is a thief
 us tarah kaa maamla to nahin he phir bhi garib ke ghar ke baahar garib likhte vakt itnaa to sochna chahie ki uski bhi kuch maan maryaada he
 The poor also have pride
 ek chiz samaj leni chahie ki sabsidi kairaat nahin he, na hi bheekh he balki yah adhikaar he jise dete samay sarkarein sansad main kanoon banaati he, mantrimandal main faisla hota he
 When the ration card holders in Rajasthan have been linked to Aadhaar, what was the need to write on the wall that i am poor
 phir aadhaar ko band kar diwaar par hi likhnaa chahie ki main garib hum or rashan letaa hum
 The comments ye report 201 kii he hamaari purv sahyogi rubina khan shapu ne kii thi
 The wall is of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan ke gopalganj ke gaanvon main parivaar waalon kii manzuri ke bina diwaar par garib likh diya gaya he
 Then Bhikham had told Rubina Khan Shapoo that it is painful to see this written outside his house
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya ki ham garib hai
 It will be difficult for the daughter to get married
 jab media main yah baat ai to prashasan ne ise mitaa diya
 But the Scheduled Tribes were very angry with this because it had not happened to them for the first time
 2009 ke saal main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat bhi kii thi ki is tarah kii nishandehi se unka apmaan hota he
 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have BJP governments, but even when the Congress was in Haryana in 2008, the state government had decided that BPL would paint BPL numbers on the walls of families
 us samay bhi khub vivaad hua tha
 The Minister of Panchayati Raj of Rajasthan said that the 2009 order of the previous Congress government was written under the same
 kamaal he 2013 se rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 This is the fourth year and the 2009 orders are coming into force
 ganimat he mantri ji ise sahi nahin maanate hai or hatwane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anyway, if the government has the same argument that the rich or those who are not poor take advantage of the BPL scheme, then it should be written on the wall of their houses that i am rich and take advantage of the BPL scheme
 venkaiya naidu ke bayaan main chaar bindu hai
 The first is that karzmafi is becoming fashionable
 doosraa ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan nahin he, ye koi nahin kahata ki karz maafee antim samaadhaan he
 The third point is that what steps should be taken to get the money in the hands of the farmers, then they should review it because the government is theirs and the government must have taken steps
 chauthaa bindu yah he ki karz maafee extream sichuation main honi chahie
 What is this extreme situation? 22 june ko madhya pradesh ke do kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Farmer Gulai Kurmi of Basari village in Sagar had a loan of Rs 8 lakh
 11 acre zamin ke is kisaan ke paas karz ke kaaran khudakushi karne kii koi vajah nahin honi chahie thi
 But 5 acres of Gullai Kurmi land paying the debt was also sold
 jo 7 acre zamin bachi thi us par bhi mahanaj kii nazar pad gai thi
 It is evident that the farmer was burdened with debt and was unable to save his land
 us par central bank se tractor kaa lone liya tha jisaki kisht nahin de paa rahaa tha
 a suicide note has also been found from Gulai's pocket

 sagar ke basaari gaanv ke kisaan guli kurmi par 8 lakh rupee kaa karz tha
 This farmer of 11 acres of land should have no reason to commit suicide due to debt
 lekin karz chukaate chukaate guli kurmi kii 5 acre zamin bik bhi gai
 Mahanaj's eyes were also on the 7 acres of land that was left
 zaahir he kisaan karz se dabaa hua tha or apni zamin nahin bachaa paa rahaa tha
 He had taken a loan of a tractor from the Central Bank, which was unable to pay its installment

 By listening to that letter, you can understand who are taking the lives of farmers

 In Madhya Pradesh, 20 farmers have committed suicide in 15 days
 13 june ko madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne kaha tha ki pichley ek saal main sirf chaar kisaanon ne karz ke kaaran aatmahatya kii he
 These are the same ministers who said that farmers have not died from the police bullet, then three days later, they believed that they had died from the police bullet
 3 may ko supreme court main centre ne jo halafanama diya he usamen bataaya he ki 2015 main madhya pradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 Nowhere does it say that these farmers have not committed suicide due to debt, but have said that due to stress in agriculture, there is tension and the government is also trying to increase their income
 hamane mangalvaar ke prime time main madhya pradesh ke apane sahyogi anuraag dwari se poocha tha ki in mahajanon ke peeche zarur raajnneetik takat hoti hogi
 It should be properly investigated from whom the farmers are taking interest at 20 to 24 percent and who are those people

 Budni is the name of the tehsil of Sihor district of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, where 55-year-old Shatrughan Meena committed suicide by consuming sulfas on the morning of 22 June
 parivaar ke log hoshangabad ke nijee aspataal bhi le gaye magar shatrughna ne dam tod diya
 According to family members, Shatrughan had a loan of one million
 apane khet main bijli kaa sthai conection lene ke liye ve 22 june ko tehsil karyaalay gaye
 It was found that the seven acres of land that they are considering as their own are not their names
 bas vahaan se laut kar sulphas kha lee or aatmahatya kar lee
 Son alleges that local BJP leader Arjun Malaviya has grabbed his land
 bijepi ke pravaktaa ne mana he ki arjuna malviya party ke netaa hai magar aarope kii jaanch honi chahie
 By the way, our colleague Anurag Dwari has also favored Arjun Malaviya
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan agar chahenge to aasaani se pataa kar sakate hai ki shatrughna meena kii zamin kisi ne apane naam kii he yaa nahin, agar kii he to tehsil karyaalay main koun koun log shaamil rahe hai
 The statement of the spokesperson is strange that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the BJP but his brother is a Congressman
 punjab ke tarantaaran main bhi do kisaanon ne 22 june ko khudakushi kii he
 Farmer Joginder Singh of Kot Sewya of Tarn Taran and Dalbir Singh farmer of Alowal village of Khadur Sahib village committed suicide
 joginder singh par saat lakh kaa karz tha
 Of this, five lakh loans were from the bank, two lakhs were taken from the stock and two and a half acres of land
 dalbir singh ne bhi raat ko sote vakt zehar pi liya
 Dalbir Singh had taken 4 lakhs of agents
 do lakh jalandhar ke duusare achhatiyon se liye the
 There was a loan of one lakh bank and four acres of land
 saath saal kii umr main koi kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he to iskaa matlab he ki kisaan extream sichuation main he
 The details of the loan were told so that you know where the farmer is taking the loan from
 maafee kitne kii ho rahi he ek lakh yaa do lakh
 That too has been announced
 22 june ko chaar kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Shiv Sena has criticized Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 nikhil pandhi hamaare sahyogi hai
 He spoke to a farmer from Raila village of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab
 35 saal se kheti kar rahe hai
 It is said that the loan is increasing every year
 kheti kii laagat badhati ja rahi he
 The price is not available according to the cost
 parivaar main paanch log hai
 Two daughters and a son
 sabaki shaadi honi he lekin shaadi karne ke paise nahin hai
 Now they are considering giving up farming
 kehete hai ki ab kheti karuunga to kheti hi kisaan ko kha jaaegi, kisaan kya kheti se khaayegaa
 Jotdar Kanwal Singh of 6 Bigha carries a loan of 4 lakhs
 pichley saal ludhiana ke sahiban gaanv ke jasvindar singh ne apane paanch saal ke bete ko seene se lagaaya or nahar main kudakar jaan de di
 Jaswinder had a bank loan of one million
 dedh acre kii zamin thi
 Isn't this extreme situation? kya aise extream sichuation vaale kisaanon ke das lakh lone maaf karegi sarkaar? kahin bhi ek lakh yaa do lakh se zyaada kaa lone maaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Then how did it become fashion
 kai saal pehle maine raveesh kii report main bhivani se ek report kii thi vahaan kai aspataal mili jinke baahar likhaa tha zehar khaaye marizon kaa aspataal
 Today i got a picture of those hospitals from my colleague from Bhiwani
 ye astpal aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Outside a hospital, even spray is written, poison is also written
 kya aapane sulphas khaae marizon ke ilaaj ke astpal ke board dilli mumbai main dekhe hai
 There are different reasons for eating sulfas, but within them there is also an economic crisis within agriculture
 bharat kaa kisaan jaan bhi detaa he or laaj bhi bachaa lenaa chahta he
 a 2015 National Crime Branch Bureau report states that 162 people related to the farming sector in Haryana committed suicide and 28 farmers committed suicide
 thik he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ko bharosa he ki wo kisaanon ko dharm or jati main baant degi, or chunaav ke vakt kisaan khushi khushi bant bhi jate hai lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai
 Six farmers commit suicide every day in Telangana
 isi saal 3 may ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama diya he ki kheti ke sector main har saal 12000 kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 Is it not extreme circumstance to commit suicide of 12,000 farmers in a year? ab aate hai rajasthan kii ek khabar par
 The government makes a good joke with the poor
 main garib parivaar se hum or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium yani enegese ke tahat rashan letaa hum
 Beneficiary Rajbai, son, Prabhudayal, BPL number 641941
 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he

 garib kaa bhi swabhimaan hota he
 One thing has to be understood that subsidy is not a bailout, nor a begging, but it is a right, which the government makes laws in Parliament, the cabinet decides when giving
 rajasthan main rashan card dharakon ko jab aadhaar se jod diya gaya he tab diwaar par likhane kii kya zarurat thi ki main garib hum
 Then close the base and write on the wall that i am poor and take ration
 tippaniyan This report of 201 was made by our former colleague Rubina Khan Shapu
 diwaar he madhyapradesh kii
 In the villages of Gopalganj here, the poor have been written on the wall without the approval of the family
 tab bheekhm ne rubina khan shapu se kaha tha ki apane ghar ke baahar is tarah se likhaa dekh pidaa hoti he
 Now everyone knows that we are poor
 beti kii shaadi hone main mushkil aegi
 When this thing came in the media, the administration deleted it
 magar anusuchit janajati ke log is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hue the kyonki unke saath pehali baar aisa nahin hua tha

 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum
 Usury charges 20 to 24 percent
 kisaanon ko zarurat kaa sara paisa bank se nahin miltaa he
 In Madhya Pradesh, 20 farmers have committed suicide in 15 days
 13 june ko madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne kaha tha ki pichley ek saal main sirf chaar kisaanon ne karz ke kaaran aatmahatya kii he
 These are the same ministers who said that farmers have not died from the police bullet, then three days later, they believed that they had died from the police bullet
 3 may ko supreme court main centre ne jo halafanama diya he usamen bataaya he ki 2015 main madhya pradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 Nowhere does it say that these farmers have not committed suicide due to debt, but have said that due to stress in agriculture, there is tension and the government is also trying to increase their income
 hamane mangalvaar ke prime time main madhya pradesh ke apane sahyogi anuraag dwari se poocha tha ki in mahajanon ke peeche zarur raajnneetik takat hoti hogi
 It should be properly investigated from whom the farmers are taking interest at 20 to 24 percent and who are those people
 kisaan bank se pareshaan he yaa in mahajanon ke changul se
 Budni is the name of the tehsil of Sihor district of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, where 55-year-old Shatrughan Meena committed suicide by consuming sulfas on the morning of 22 June
 parivaar ke log hoshangabad ke nijee aspataal bhi le gaye magar shatrughna ne dam tod diya
 According to family members, Shatrughan had a loan of one million
 apane khet main bijli kaa sthai conection lene ke liye ve 22 june ko tehsil karyaalay gaye
 It was found that the seven acres of land that they are considering as their own are not their names
 bas vahaan se laut kar sulphas kha lee or aatmahatya kar lee
 Son alleges that local BJP leader Arjun Malaviya has grabbed his land
 bijepi ke pravaktaa ne mana he ki arjuna malviya party ke netaa hai magar aarope kii jaanch honi chahie
 By the way, our colleague Anurag Dwari has also favored Arjun Malaviya
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan agar chahenge to aasaani se pataa kar sakate hai ki shatrughna meena kii zamin kisi ne apane naam kii he yaa nahin, agar kii he to tehsil karyaalay main koun koun log shaamil rahe hai
 The statement of the spokesperson is strange that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the BJP but his brother is a Congressman
 punjab ke tarantaaran main bhi do kisaanon ne 22 june ko khudakushi kii he
 Farmer Joginder Singh of Kot Sewya of Tarn Taran and Dalbir Singh farmer of Alowal village of Khadur Sahib village committed suicide
 joginder singh par saat lakh kaa karz tha
 Of this, five lakh loans were from the bank, two lakhs were taken from the stock and two and a half acres of land

 Dalbir Singh had taken 4 lakhs of agents
 do lakh jalandhar ke duusare achhatiyon se liye the
 There was a loan of one lakh bank and four acres of land
 saath saal kii umr main koi kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he to iskaa matlab he ki kisaan extream sichuation main he
 The details of the loan were told so that you know where the farmer is taking the loan from
 maafee kitne kii ho rahi he ek lakh yaa do lakh
 That too has been announced
 22 june ko chaar kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Shiv Sena has criticized Venkaiah Naidu's statement
 nikhil pandhi hamaare sahyogi hai
 He spoke to a farmer from Raila village of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab
 35 saal se kheti kar rahe hai
 It is said that the loan is increasing every year
 kheti kii laagat badhati ja rahi he
 The price is not available according to the cost
 parivaar main paanch log hai
 Two daughters and a son
 sabaki shaadi honi he lekin shaadi karne ke paise nahin hai
 Now they are considering giving up farming
 kehete hai ki ab kheti karuunga to kheti hi kisaan ko kha jaaegi, kisaan kya kheti se khaayegaa
 Jotdar Kanwal Singh of 6 Bigha carries a loan of 4 lakhs
 pichley saal ludhiana ke sahiban gaanv ke jasvindar singh ne apane paanch saal ke bete ko seene se lagaaya or nahar main kudakar jaan de di
 Jaswinder had a bank loan of one million
 dedh acre kii zamin thi
 Isn't this extreme situation? kya aise extream sichuation vaale kisaanon ke das lakh lone maaf karegi sarkaar? kahin bhi ek lakh yaa do lakh se zyaada kaa lone maaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Then how did it become fashion
 kai saal pehle maine raveesh kii report main bhivani se ek report kii thi vahaan kai aspataal mili jinke baahar likhaa tha zehar khaaye marizon kaa aspataal
 Today i got a picture of those hospitals from my colleague from Bhiwani
 ye astpal aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Outside a hospital, even spray is written, poison is also written
 kya aapane sulphas khaae marizon ke ilaaj ke astpal ke board dilli mumbai main dekhe hai
 There are different reasons for eating sulfas, but within them there is also an economic crisis within agriculture
 bharat kaa kisaan jaan bhi detaa he or laaj bhi bachaa lenaa chahta he
 a 2015 National Crime Branch Bureau report states that 162 people related to the farming sector in Haryana committed suicide and 28 farmers committed suicide
 thik he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ko bharosa he ki wo kisaanon ko dharm or jati main baant degi, or chunaav ke vakt kisaan khushi khushi bant bhi jate hai lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai
 Six farmers commit suicide every day in Telangana
 isi saal 3 may ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama diya he ki kheti ke sector main har saal 12000 kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 Is it not extreme circumstance to commit suicide of 12,000 farmers in a year? ab aate hai rajasthan kii ek khabar par
 The government makes a good joke with the poor
 main garib parivaar se hum or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium yani enegese ke tahat rashan letaa hum
 Beneficiary Rajbai, son, Prabhudayal, BPL number 641941
 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he

 Family members also took him to a private hospital in Hoshangabad, but Shatrughan died
 parivaaravaalon ke anusaar shatrughna par das lakh kaa karz tha
 He went to the tehsil office on 22 June to get a permanent connection to his farm
 vahaan pataa chalaa ki jis saat acre zamin ko wo apana maan rahe hai wo unke naam nahin he
 Just returned from there, ate sulfas and committed suicide
 bete kaa aarope he ki bijepi ke sthaneey netaa arjuna malviya ne unki zamin hadap lee he
 BJP spokesperson has admitted that Arjun Malaviya is the leader of the party but the charge should be investigated
 vaise hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne arjuna malviya se bhi unka paksh liya he
 If Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan wishes, then he can easily find out whether anyone has owned Shatrughan Meena's land or not, if he has, then who are involved in the Tehsil office
 pravaktaa kaa yah bayaan ajeeb he ki arjuna malviya bijepi ke netaa hai lekin unke bhai congressi hai
 Two farmers have committed suicide on 22 June in the swimming pool of Punjab
 tarantaaran ke kot siwaya ke kisaan joginder singh or khadur sahib ke padate gaanv aloval ke kisaan dalbir singh ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Joginder Singh had a loan of seven lakhs
 isamen paanch lakh karj bank kaa tha, do lakh aadhati se liye the or dhai acre zamin thi
 Dalbir Singh also drank poison while sleeping at night
 dalbir singh ne 4 lakh aadhati se liye the
 Two lakhs were taken from other adalathas of Jalandhar
 ek lakh bank kaa karj tha or chaar acre zamin thi
 If a farmer is committing suicide at the age of sixty, it means that the farmer is in extreme situation
 karz kaa detail isliye bataaya taaki aapako pataa chale ki kisaan kahaan kahaan se karz le rahaa he
 How much is an apology for one lakh or two lakhs
 wo bhi elaan hi hua he
 On June 22, four farmers committed suicide
 shivasena ne venkaiya naidu ke bayaan kii aalochana kii he
 Nikhil Pandhi is our colleague
 unhone punjab ke fatehgarh sahib ke railon gaanv ke ek kisaan se baat kii
 Have been farming for 35 years
 kehete hai ki har saal karz badhata hi ja rahaa he
 The cost of farming is increasing
 jo laagat he uske hisaab se daam nahin mil rahaa he
 There are five people in the family
 do betiyaan or ek betaa
 Everyone has to get married but there is no money to marry
 ab ve kheti chhodane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 It is said that if i do farming now, farming will eat the farmer, what will the farmer eat from farming
 6 bigha ke jotdar kanwal singh par 4 lakh kaa karza he
 Last year, Jaswinder Singh of Sahiban village in Ludhiana stabbed his five-year-old son by chest and jumped into the canal and gave him life
 jasvindar par das lakh kaa bank lone tha
 There was one and a half acres of land
 kya ye extream sichuation nahin he
 Will the government waive one million loans of farmers with such extreme conditions? Nowhere is a loan of more than one lakh or two lakhs waived
 phir ye fishan kaise ho gaya
 Many years ago, i had made a report from Bhiwani in Ravish's report, found several hospitals outside which the hospital of poisoned patients was written
 aaj maine bhivani se apane sahyogi se un aspataalon kii tasviir mangai
 These astpals still exist today
 ek aspataal ke baahar to spray bhi likhaa he, zehar bhi likhaa he
 Have you seen Astpal's board in Delhi Mumbai for treating patients who have eaten sulfas
 sulphas khaane ke alag alag kaaran hai magar inke bheetar kheti ke bheetar kaa aarthik sankat bhi he
 The farmer of India dies and Laj also wants to be saved
 2015 ke rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report bataati he ki haryana main kheti ke sector se jude 162 logon ne aatmahatya kii or 28 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Well, the politics of India is confident that it will divide the farmers into religion and caste, and during the elections the farmers are happily divided but it is also a fact that suicides are happening
 telugana main har din chah kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 On May 3 this year, the central government has given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that every year 12000 farmers commit suicide in the farming sector
 ek saal main 12,000 kisaanon kaa aatmahatya karnaa kya extream sichuation nahin he
 Now come to a news of Rajasthan
 garib ke saath sarkaar hi acha mazaaq karti he
 i belong to a poor family and take ration under the National Food Security Act ie NFSA
 labhaarthi rajbai, putr, prabhudayal, bipiel number 641941
 The government says that many people had joined this scheme which was not entitled to BPL, hence it has been written
 dausa zile ke is gaanv main agar aap aaen or kuch gharon par aisa likhaa dekhen to kya aapke man ko thes nahin pahonchegi
 Well, you have started living in Delhi Mumbai but till a few decades ago, there was a ration item in your house too, think how would you feel if the government had written it out
 sarkaar apane record main hisaab rakhe, garib ke ghar ke baahar kyon likhaa gaya he ki main garib parivaar se hum or rashan letaa hum
 Our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh has told that in Dausa district there are 52,164 families BPL i
e
 people below poverty line
 sarkaar ne dedh lakh se adhik gharon ke baahar kii diwaar par main garib parivaar se hum likhva diya he
 i am not saying that writing like this is like that scene of the movie 'wall' in which Vijay's hand was written that my father is a thief
 us tarah kaa maamla to nahin he phir bhi garib ke ghar ke baahar garib likhte vakt itnaa to sochna chahie ki uski bhi kuch maan maryaada he
 The poor also have pride
 ek chiz samaj leni chahie ki sabsidi kairaat nahin he, na hi bheekh he balki yah adhikaar he jise dete samay sarkarein sansad main kanoon banaati he, mantrimandal main faisla hota he
 When the ration card holders in Rajasthan have been linked to Aadhaar, what was the need to write on the wall that i am poor
 phir aadhaar ko band kar diwaar par hi likhnaa chahie ki main garib hum or rashan letaa hum
 The comments ye report 201 kii he hamaari purv sahyogi rubina khan shapu ne kii thi
 The wall is of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan ke gopalganj ke gaanvon main parivaar waalon kii manzuri ke bina diwaar par garib likh diya gaya he
 Then Bhikham had told Rubina Khan Shapoo that it is painful to see this written outside his house
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya ki ham garib hai
 It will be difficult for the daughter to get married
 jab media main yah baat ai to prashasan ne ise mitaa diya
 But the Scheduled Tribes were very angry with this because it had not happened to them for the first time
 2009 ke saal main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat bhi kii thi ki is tarah kii nishandehi se unka apmaan hota he
 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have BJP governments, but even when the Congress was in Haryana in 2008, the state government had decided that BPL would paint BPL numbers on the walls of families
 us samay bhi khub vivaad hua tha
 The Minister of Panchayati Raj of Rajasthan said that the 2009 order of the previous Congress government was written under the same
 kamaal he 2013 se rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 This is the fourth year and the 2009 orders are coming into force
 ganimat he mantri ji ise sahi nahin maanate hai or hatwane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anyway, if the government has the same argument that the rich or those who are not poor take advantage of the BPL scheme, then it should be written on the wall of their houses that i am rich and take advantage of the BPL scheme
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan agar chahenge to aasaani se pataa kar sakate hai ki shatrughna meena kii zamin kisi ne apane naam kii he yaa nahin, agar kii he to tehsil karyaalay main koun koun log shaamil rahe hai

 On May 3 this year, the central government has given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that every year 12000 farmers commit suicide in the farming sector
 ek saal main 12,000 kisaanon kaa aatmahatya karnaa kya extream sichuation nahin he
 Now come to a news of Rajasthan
 garib ke saath sarkaar hi acha mazaaq karti he
 i belong to a poor family and take ration under the National Food Security Act ie NFSA
 labhaarthi rajbai, putr, prabhudayal, bipiel number 641941
 The government says that many people had joined this scheme which was not entitled to BPL, hence it has been written
 dausa zile ke is gaanv main agar aap aaen or kuch gharon par aisa likhaa dekhen to kya aapke man ko thes nahin pahonchegi
 Well, you have started living in Delhi Mumbai but till a few decades ago, there was a ration item in your house too, think how would you feel if the government had written it out
 sarkaar apane record main hisaab rakhe, garib ke ghar ke baahar kyon likhaa gaya he ki main garib parivaar se hum or rashan letaa hum
 Our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh has told that in Dausa district there are 52,164 families BPL i
e
 people below poverty line
 sarkaar ne dedh lakh se adhik gharon ke baahar kii diwaar par main garib parivaar se hum likhva diya he
 i am not saying that writing like this is like that scene of the movie 'wall' in which Vijay's hand was written that my father is a thief
 us tarah kaa maamla to nahin he phir bhi garib ke ghar ke baahar garib likhte vakt itnaa to sochna chahie ki uski bhi kuch maan maryaada he
 The poor also have pride
 ek chiz samaj leni chahie ki sabsidi kairaat nahin he, na hi bheekh he balki yah adhikaar he jise dete samay sarkarein sansad main kanoon banaati he, mantrimandal main faisla hota he
 When the ration card holders in Rajasthan have been linked to Aadhaar, what was the need to write on the wall that i am poor
 phir aadhaar ko band kar diwaar par hi likhnaa chahie ki main garib hum or rashan letaa hum
 The comments ye report 201 kii he hamaari purv sahyogi rubina khan shapu ne kii thi
 The wall is of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan ke gopalganj ke gaanvon main parivaar waalon kii manzuri ke bina diwaar par garib likh diya gaya he
 Then Bhikham had told Rubina Khan Shapoo that it is painful to see this written outside his house
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya ki ham garib hai
 It will be difficult for the daughter to get married
 jab media main yah baat ai to prashasan ne ise mitaa diya
 But the Scheduled Tribes were very angry with this because it had not happened to them for the first time
 2009 ke saal main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat bhi kii thi ki is tarah kii nishandehi se unka apmaan hota he
 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have BJP governments, but even when the Congress was in Haryana in 2008, the state government had decided that BPL would paint BPL numbers on the walls of families
 us samay bhi khub vivaad hua tha
 The Minister of Panchayati Raj of Rajasthan said that the 2009 order of the previous Congress government was written under the same
 kamaal he 2013 se rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 This is the fourth year and the 2009 orders are coming into force
 ganimat he mantri ji ise sahi nahin maanate hai or hatwane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anyway, if the government has the same argument that the rich or those who are not poor take advantage of the BPL scheme, then it should be written on the wall of their houses that i am rich and take advantage of the BPL scheme
 karz kaa detail isliye bataaya taaki aapako pataa chale ki kisaan kahaan kahaan se karz le rahaa he

 Nikhil Pandhi is our colleague

 Everyone has to get married but there is no money to marry
 ab ve kheti chhodane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 It is said that if i do farming now, farming will eat the farmer, what will the farmer eat from farming
 6 bigha ke jotdar kanwal singh par 4 lakh kaa karza he
 Last year, Jaswinder Singh of Sahiban village in Ludhiana stabbed his five-year-old son by chest and jumped into the canal and gave him life
 jasvindar par das lakh kaa bank lone tha
 There was one and a half acres of land
 kya ye extream sichuation nahin he
 Will the government waive one million loans of farmers with such extreme conditions? Nowhere is a loan of more than one lakh or two lakhs waived
 phir ye fishan kaise ho gaya
 Many years ago, i had made a report from Bhiwani in Ravish's report, found several hospitals outside which the hospital of poisoned patients was written
 aaj maine bhivani se apane sahyogi se un aspataalon kii tasviir mangai
 These astpals still exist today
 ek aspataal ke baahar to spray bhi likhaa he, zehar bhi likhaa he
 Have you seen Astpal's board in Delhi Mumbai for treating patients who have eaten sulfas
 sulphas khaane ke alag alag kaaran hai magar inke bheetar kheti ke bheetar kaa aarthik sankat bhi he
 The farmer of India dies and Laj also wants to be saved
 2015 ke rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report bataati he ki haryana main kheti ke sector se jude 162 logon ne aatmahatya kii or 28 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii

 nikhil pandhi hamaare sahyogi hai
 He spoke to a farmer from Raila village of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab
 35 saal se kheti kar rahe hai
 It is said that the loan is increasing every year
 kheti kii laagat badhati ja rahi he
 The price is not available according to the cost
 parivaar main paanch log hai
 Two daughters and a son
 sabaki shaadi honi he lekin shaadi karne ke paise nahin hai
 Now they are considering giving up farming
 kehete hai ki ab kheti karuunga to kheti hi kisaan ko kha jaaegi, kisaan kya kheti se khaayegaa
 Jotdar Kanwal Singh of 6 Bigha carries a loan of 4 lakhs
 pichley saal ludhiana ke sahiban gaanv ke jasvindar singh ne apane paanch saal ke bete ko seene se lagaaya or nahar main kudakar jaan de di
 Jaswinder had a bank loan of one million
 dedh acre kii zamin thi
 Isn't this extreme situation? kya aise extream sichuation vaale kisaanon ke das lakh lone maaf karegi sarkaar? kahin bhi ek lakh yaa do lakh se zyaada kaa lone maaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Then how did it become fashion
 kai saal pehle maine raveesh kii report main bhivani se ek report kii thi vahaan kai aspataal mili jinke baahar likhaa tha zehar khaaye marizon kaa aspataal
 Today i got a picture of those hospitals from my colleague from Bhiwani
 ye astpal aaj bhi maujuud hai
 Outside a hospital, even spray is written, poison is also written
 kya aapane sulphas khaae marizon ke ilaaj ke astpal ke board dilli mumbai main dekhe hai
 There are different reasons for eating sulfas, but within them there is also an economic crisis within agriculture
 bharat kaa kisaan jaan bhi detaa he or laaj bhi bachaa lenaa chahta he
 a 2015 National Crime Branch Bureau report states that 162 people related to the farming sector in Haryana committed suicide and 28 farmers committed suicide
 thik he ki bharat kii raajnneeti ko bharosa he ki wo kisaanon ko dharm or jati main baant degi, or chunaav ke vakt kisaan khushi khushi bant bhi jate hai lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai
 Six farmers commit suicide every day in Telangana
 isi saal 3 may ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama diya he ki kheti ke sector main har saal 12000 kisaan aatmahatya karte hai
 Is it not extreme circumstance to commit suicide of 12,000 farmers in a year? ab aate hai rajasthan kii ek khabar par
 The government makes a good joke with the poor
 main garib parivaar se hum or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium yani enegese ke tahat rashan letaa hum
 Beneficiary Rajbai, son, Prabhudayal, BPL number 641941
 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he
 It is not a case of that kind, yet while writing the poor outside the house of the poor one should think that he too has some dignity
 garib kaa bhi swabhimaan hota he
 One thing has to be understood that subsidy is not a bailout, nor a begging, but it is a right, which the government makes laws in Parliament, the cabinet decides when giving
 rajasthan main rashan card dharakon ko jab aadhaar se jod diya gaya he tab diwaar par likhane kii kya zarurat thi ki main garib hum
 Then close the base and write on the wall that i am poor and take ration
 tippaniyan This report of 201 was made by our former colleague Rubina Khan Shapu
 diwaar he madhyapradesh kii
 In the villages of Gopalganj here, the poor have been written on the wall without the approval of the family
 tab bheekhm ne rubina khan shapu se kaha tha ki apane ghar ke baahar is tarah se likhaa dekh pidaa hoti he
 Now everyone knows that we are poor
 beti kii shaadi hone main mushkil aegi
 When this thing came in the media, the administration deleted it
 magar anusuchit janajati ke log is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hue the kyonki unke saath pehali baar aisa nahin hua tha
 In the year of 2009, he also complained to the National Human Rights Commission that he was insulted by such trafficking
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar he magar 2008 main haryana main jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bhi rajya sarkaar ne faisla liya tha ki bipiel pariwaron kii deevaaron par bipiel number paint karegi
 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum

 sarkaar kahati he ki kai log aise is yojana main shaamil ho gaye the jo bipiel ke hakdaar nahin the isliye likhaa gaya he
 If you come to this village of Dausa district and see some such writings on some houses, will it not hurt your mind
 thik he ki aap dilli mumbai main rahane lage hai lekin kuch dashak pehle tak aapke ghar main bhi to rashan kaa saamaan aata tha, sochiye ki sarkaar baahar likhva detii to aapako kaisaa lagata
 The government should keep an account in their records, why is it written outside the house of the poor that i belong to a poor family and take ration
 hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh ne bataaya he ki dausa zile main 52,164 parivaar bipiel hai yani garibi rekha se neeche ke log hai
 The government has written on the wall outside more than one and a half lakh houses that i belong to a poor family
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aisa likhnaa 'diwaar' film ke us seen kii tarah he jisamen vijay ke haath par likh diya gaya tha ki meraa baap chor he
 It is not a case of that kind, yet while writing the poor outside the house of the poor one should think that he too has some dignity
 garib kaa bhi swabhimaan hota he
 One thing has to be understood that subsidy is not a bailout, nor a begging, but it is a right, which the government makes laws in Parliament, the cabinet decides when giving
 rajasthan main rashan card dharakon ko jab aadhaar se jod diya gaya he tab diwaar par likhane kii kya zarurat thi ki main garib hum
 Then close the base and write on the wall that i am poor and take ration
 tippaniyan This report of 201 was made by our former colleague Rubina Khan Shapu
 diwaar he madhyapradesh kii
 In the villages of Gopalganj here, the poor have been written on the wall without the approval of the family
 tab bheekhm ne rubina khan shapu se kaha tha ki apane ghar ke baahar is tarah se likhaa dekh pidaa hoti he
 Now everyone knows that we are poor
 beti kii shaadi hone main mushkil aegi
 When this thing came in the media, the administration deleted it
 magar anusuchit janajati ke log is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hue the kyonki unke saath pehali baar aisa nahin hua tha
 In the year of 2009, he also complained to the National Human Rights Commission that he was insulted by such trafficking
 rajasthan or madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar he magar 2008 main haryana main jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bhi rajya sarkaar ne faisla liya tha ki bipiel pariwaron kii deevaaron par bipiel number paint karegi
 There was a lot of controversy at that time also
 rajasthan ke panchayat raaj mantri ne kaha ki pichhali congress sarkaar kaa 2009 aadesh tha usee ke tahat likhaa gaya he
 Amazing, BJP has a government in Rajasthan since 2013
 yah chauthaa saal he or 2009 ke aadesh lagu ho rahe hai
 It is a matter of honor that the Minister does not consider it right and is asking for removal
 vaise bhi sarkaar ke paas agar yahi daleel he ki amir yaa jo garib nahin hai wo bipiel yojana kaa laabh le lete hai to unke gharon kii diwaar par likhaa hona chahie ki main amir hum or bipiel kii yojana kaa laabh letaa hum
 i am not saying that writing like this is like that scene of the movie 'wall' in which Vijay's hand was written that my father is a thief
 us tarah kaa maamla to nahin he phir bhi garib ke ghar ke baahar garib likhte vakt itnaa to sochna chahie ki uski bhi kuch maan maryaada he
 The poor also have pride
 ek chiz samaj leni chahie ki sabsidi kairaat nahin he, na hi bheekh he balki yah adhikaar he jise dete samay sarkarein sansad main kanoon banaati he, mantrimandal main faisla hota he
 When the ration card holders in Rajasthan have been linked to Aadhaar, what was the need to write on the wall that i am poor
 phir aadhaar ko band kar diwaar par hi likhnaa chahie ki main garib hum or rashan letaa hum
 The comments ye report 201 kii he hamaari purv sahyogi rubina khan shapu ne kii thi
 The wall is of Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan ke gopalganj ke gaanvon main parivaar waalon kii manzuri ke bina diwaar par garib likh diya gaya he
 Then Bhikham had told Rubina Khan Shapoo that it is painful to see this written outside his house
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya ki ham garib hai
 It will be difficult for the daughter to get married
 jab media main yah baat ai to prashasan ne ise mitaa diya
 But the Scheduled Tribes were very angry with this because it had not happened to them for the first time
 2009 ke saal main rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat bhi kii thi ki is tarah kii nishandehi se unka apmaan hota he
 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have BJP governments, but even when the Congress was in Haryana in 2008, the state government had decided that BPL would paint BPL numbers on the walls of families
 us samay bhi khub vivaad hua tha
 The Minister of Panchayati Raj of Rajasthan said that the 2009 order of the previous Congress government was written under the same
 kamaal he 2013 se rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 This is the fourth year and the 2009 orders are coming into force
 ganimat he mantri ji ise sahi nahin maanate hai or hatwane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anyway, if the government has the same argument that the rich or those who are not poor take advantage of the BPL scheme, then it should be written on the wall of their houses that i am rich and take advantage of the BPL scheme

 Nitin Gadkari is likely to face a challenge from Mahesh Jethmalani, son of BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ramjethmalani, in the race for the post of BJP president
 mahesh jethmalani kaa kahana he ki vah nitin gadakari ke khilaaf chunaav main khadey ho sakate hai, lekin unhone abhi is par antim faisla nahin liya he
 He said that if the token is contested then he can contest the election
 isse pehle khabar ai thi ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) samarthit nitin gadakari ko bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa doosraa kaarykaal dene par aam sahmati banati dikh rahi he
 The election for this post will be held on 23 January
 party sutron ne bataaya ki varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani antat: sahamat ho gaye hai, kyonki kisi anya ummidavaar ke naam par sahmati nahin ban saki he
 At first he objected to giving Gadkari a second term
 pichley saptaah tak adwani khemaa or aresas aamasahmati se kisi ummidavaar ko chunane main laga tha
 According to sources, Advani had objected to handing over a second term to Gadkari, surrounded by allegations of suspected money source from the Purti group
 unhone isse pehle is pad ke liye ravishankar prasad ke naam kaa sujhaayaa tha
 The name of Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was also discussed, but she herself did not show much eagerness for the post
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke naam kii bhi charchaa chal rahi thi, lekin party ke netaaon ne isaki sambhaavnaaon ne inkaar karte hue kaha ki unka naam adwani kii sambhaviton kii suchi main shaamil nahin he
 Sources said that Modi himself is not keen on becoming the party president, but he can play an important role in election management for the BJP at the central level in the next Lok Sabha elections
 aresas gadakari ko duusari baar party adhyaksh banane par bal detaa rahaa he or swayan sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat khud bhi unka samarthan kar rahe hai
 The Sangh feels that after losing the Lok Sabha elections for the second consecutive time, Gadkari, who takes charge of the party, should get the leadership of the party in the next Lok Sabha
 uskaa maananaa he ki gadakari ne teen saal pehle jo kaam apane haath main liya tha vah ab bhi puraa nahin ho paaya he
 BJP today issued a notification for the election of national president
 yahaan jari ek adhisuchana main party ne kaha ki 23 janvari subah das baje se lekar saadhe gyaarah baje tak namakan patr daakhil kiye jaaenge or saadhe gyaarah baje se lekar 12 baje tak unki jaanch kii jaaegi
 If the need is felt after the withdrawal of the name from twelve o'clock to twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the date of the election will be announced
 yadi pratispardhaa nahin hui to usee din saadhe baarah baje nirvaachit ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Sources told here that Nitin Gadkari can file nomination papers on 23 January and if no other nomination is found, he will be declared elected unopposed
 is bich party ne gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal die jane par rassakassi sambandhi khabaron par kanni kaat lee
 The comments jab party pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi se poocha gaya ki kya adwani ne adhyaksh pad ke liye sushamaa swaraj kaa naam prastaavit kiya he to unhone kaha, ‘hamaare yahaan vanshavaad nahin balki loktantr he or is par koi bhram nahin hona chahie
 Our party has internal democracy and constitution
 uske anusaar, ham kshetreey str se lekar rashtriya str tak chunaav karaate hai or chunaav prakriya chal rahi he
 When asked if names other than Gadkari are also in this competition, he said, 'you will be told about this and also the nomination
 kuch bhi gupachup nahin kiya jayega
 On the other hand, Gadkari also took a dig at questions from other candidates for the BJP national president
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe is baat kii kabhi parvaah nahin he ki mujhe party adhyaksh kaa pad miltaa he yaa nahin
 i will always work as a ground worker of BJP
 ’ Mahesh Jethmalani says that he can stand in the election against Nitin Gadkari, but he has not yet taken a final decision on it
 unhone kaha ki agar token contest hota he to vah chunaav lard sakate hai
 Earlier it was reported that there seems to be a consensus on giving a second term of BJP President to Nitin Gadkari, supported by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 is pad ke liye 23 janvari ko chunaav hoga
 Party sources said that senior leader LK Advani has finally agreed, as no other candidate could be named
 pehle unhen gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal dene par aapatti thi
 Till last week, the Advani camp and the RSS were unanimously engaged in selecting a candidate
 sutron ke anusaar, adwani ko purti samooh ke sandigdh dhanstrot ke aaropon se ghire gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal saunpane par aapatti thi
 He had earlier suggested Ravi Shankar Prasad's name for the post
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ke naam par bhi charchaa kii gai thi, lekin unhone khud hi is pad ke liye zyada utsukata nahin dikhaai
 The name of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was also being discussed, but party leaders denied the possibility that his name was not included in Advani's list of prospects
 sutron ne kaha ki modi khud bhi party adhyaksh banane ke icchhuk nahin hai, lekin vah agle loksabhaa chunaavon main kendriya str par bhaajapa ke liye chunaav prabandhan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 The RSS has been emphasizing on making Gadkari the party president for the second time and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat himself is also supporting him
 sangh ko lagata he ki lagaataar duusari baar loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baad party kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale gadakari ko agle loksabhaa main party kaa netritv milanaa chahie
 He believes that the work that Gadkari took over three years ago has still not been completed
 bhaajapa ne rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav ke liye aaj adhisuchana jari kii
 In a notification issued here, the party said that nomination papers would be filed from 10 am to 11:30 pm on 23 January and they would be examined from 11:30 am to 12 noon
 baarah baje se lekar saadhe baarah baje tak naam waapas liye jane ke baad yadi jarurat mahasoos hui to chunaav kii tithi ghoshit kii jaaegi
 If there is no competition, the elected candidate will be announced on the same day at half past twelve
 sutron ne yahaan bataaya ki nitin gadakari 23 janvari ko namakan patr daakhil kar sakate hai or yadi koi anya namakan nahin mila to unhen nirvirodh nirvaachit ghoshit kar diya jayega
 Meanwhile, the party cut back on news of tug-of-war news when Gadkari was given a second term
 tippaniyan When party spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was asked if Advani had proposed Sushma Swaraj's name for the post of president, he said, "we do not have dynasty but democracy and there should be no confusion
" hamaari party main aantarik loktantr he or samvidhan he
 According to that, we conduct elections from the regional level to the national level and the election process is going on
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya gadakari ke alaava duusare naam bhi is pratispardhaa main hai unhone kaha, ‘aapako iske bare main or namakan ke bare bhi bataaya jayega
 Nothing will be done silently
 udhar, gadakari ne bhi bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke liye anya ummidavaaron ke bare main kiye gaye sawaalon se kanni kaat lee
 He said, 'I never care whether i get the post of party president or not
 main hameshaa bhaajapa ke jamini kaaryakarta ke rup main kaam karata rahoonga
 ' isse pehle khabar ai thi ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) samarthit nitin gadakari ko bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa doosraa kaarykaal dene par aam sahmati banati dikh rahi he

 According to sources, Advani had objected to handing over a second term to Gadkari, surrounded by allegations of suspected money source from the Purti group
 unhone isse pehle is pad ke liye ravishankar prasad ke naam kaa sujhaayaa tha
 The name of Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was also discussed, but she herself did not show much eagerness for the post

 mathura ke sherpur main shahid hemraj ke gharavaale sarkaar par upeksha kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Angry and frustrated by the neglect of the central and state governments, the family of martyr Hemraj has gone on a hunger strike
 hemraj ke gaanvvaale bhi anshan par baithe hai
 It is the charge of the families that neither the funeral of the martyr nor the Chief Minister of the government came to console the government and the administration
 shahid hemraj ke ghar kii sisakiyon ne kai dard samet rakhe hai
 The young son became a martyr for the country, no problem - sadly, he could not even see his face for the last time
 gharavaalon ne kaleje par pathar rakh liya
 But the heart started crying when the state government and administration ignored it
 shahid hemraj kaa shav jab gaanv pahunchaa to gaanvvaalon ne tractor ke lite jalaae, or phir antim saskaar ke liye khud hi gas or janarator kaa intjaam kiya
 While the police administration had already been tipped
 mathura prashasan ne shahid ke antim sanskaar kii andekhi kii or usee din mantri ji ke kaarykram main pukhta intjaam dikhaa
 During the program, when Minister Durga Prasad Yadav was informed about the funeral of the martyr, he reached Sherpur village - Khanapurti and returned
 sarhad par hemraj ke saath madhya pradesh ke sudhakar singh bhi shahid hue
 When his body reached home, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself reached the martyr's house and comforted the family members
 lekin shahid hemraj ke gharavaalon kii ankhen ajtak apane soobe ke siem kaa intjaar kar rahi hai
 The Akhilesh government of UP has also made a report
 shahid hemraj ke parijanon ko 20 lakh dene kaa elaan kiya he
 But the question is when will the government approach the martyr's village
 ab jaraa uttar pradesh kii samaajawaadee sarkaar kaa jawaab sun lijie20 lakh kaa check lekar aaenge sarkaar
 But will that check end the brunt of humiliation and neglect
 kya wo check maa ke aansuon kaa hisaab de paaegaa
 Will he be able to meet the demand of the Czech wife
 jab upie-1 sarkaar main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke paas hi koyala mantralay kaa prabhaar bhi tha, us vakt karypranali se pareshaan koyala rajyamantri dasari narayan raav ek din apni naaraazgi jataane pradhanmantri karyaalay tak pahunch gaye the
 His complaint was that the action of the screening committee meeting for allocation of coal blocks was not being passed on to him, which is a clear violation of the rules and it becomes a case of encroachment of rights of the bureaucrats of PMO
 bachaav main piemo kii daleel thi ki koyala block sampann rajyon ke pratinidhiyon vaali screening cameti (jo ab badnaam ho chuki he) ke adhyaksh koyala sachiv the or karrwai par unke dastakhat ho jane ke baad baaki sab kuch yantric prakriya hi rah jaataa tha
 In this way, the approval of the Minister of State on the action of the meeting was left only a formality, which could be considered an unnecessary phase of red tape
 us din ke baad manmohan singh ne madhyamaarg apana liya
 He asked his officers not to encroach upon the rights of elected representatives and assure that the file reaches the Minister of State concerned
 haalanki unhone yah bhi spasht kar diya ki baithak kii karrwai main koi badlaav karne kaa adhikaar raav ke paas nahin hoga
 But, according to sources, Rao used to sit on the files and often raise doubts and questions
 iske baavjood yah tark apni jagah bana hua tha ki nirvaachit pratinidhi ke netritv main chalane vaale mantralay kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati he
 Now come to 2014
 koyala kshetra main gambhir badlaavon ke prati patibadgh koyala mantri piyush goyal ne tay kiya ki ve kol india ke chairman kii niyukti kaa koi rasta fouran nikaalenge
 He took up the matter at the highest level and came to the conclusion that the appointment process should be taken out of the purview of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB)
 nai prakriya ke tahat ek search cameti banaai jaani thi, naamon kii fehrist banaai jaani thi or antat koyala mantri ko naam par muhar lagaani thi
 Goyal announced this in a press conference regarding his commitment to completing 100 days of the Modi government
 haalanki piiesabi ne nai prakriya par aapattiyaan uthaain
 Within a week, the bureaucrats reviewed the process and the PMO decided to bring the selection back to the PESB
 uske baad se koyala mantri khulkar saamne nahin aae or haalat yah ho gai ki koyala blokon ke aavanton par adhyadesh ke liye ve vitt mantri arun jetali ke aspataal se lautne kaa intjaar karte rahe
 Goyal can comfort himself with the fact that he is not alone in this matter
 kuch ahm mantralayon ke cabinet mantriyon sahit unke kai mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon ke paas sunaane ko aisi kai kahaniyaan hai
 It seems that the era of autonomy and influence of the ministries has passed
 pradhanmantri narendra modi niyantran kii aisi sugam vyavastha banane main lage hai jisamen koi bhi vibhaag, yahaan tak ki cabinet mantri bhi, apane adhikaar ko lekar aashwast nahin he
 By doing so, he has established not only himself but also the Prime Minister's Office at the top of the hierarchy
 lihaaja, baaki sabhi mantri satark, asahaj or lagaataar asuraksha ke bhav main ji rahe hai
 Monitoring Modi The Prime Minister believes that it is normal for him to demand more monitoring and to find a way that he can investigate the results himself if needed
 is sandarbh main i-samiksha pehali najar main sarkaar kaa ek or sajaavati va asarkaari prashasnic aujaar jaan padataa he, lekin yah ek software se kahin zyada he
 It is a platform through which the Prime Minister can communicate directly with the officers of the Ministry and thus encroach on the Cabinet Ministers
 pradhanmantri ke nijee ipad par lod kiye gaye is software main har ahm mantralay ke saath sampark kaa ek saadhan maujuud he jinamein mote taur par infrastracchar, urja or anya nirnaayak vibhaag shaamil hai
 Every important communication sent to the Prime Minister, especially the message of the Chief Ministers, is placed in the relevant category according to the subject and department and an officer has been deputed to monitor it
 kisi bhi ‘‘karrwai ke bindu’’ par turant neeche ke str par samvaad bheja jaataa he or apadet ke taur par feedback ko pradhanmantri ke liye taiyaar kar diya jaataa he
 It is often the case that the Minister concerned later gets to know about it
 pehle aisa hota tha ki sabase pehle koi patr sambhddha mantralay ko jaataa tha or sachiv is babat soochna mantri ko detaa tha or jaruri karrwai karata tha
 It is believed that instructions have been issued to every department to update its feedback by the fifth of every month at various points of action
 pradhanmantri or piemo ke adhikariyon kii is plateform par maujuud har soochna tak pahunch he jabaki mantralay ke adhikari sirf apane vibhaag se sambandhit soochnaaon ko hi dekh sakate hai
 There is a doubt within the bureaucracy that e-review will become impractical in the long run due to the amount of information that is being regularly put on it
 rosemara kii prakriyaaon ko is tarah kaat-chhaant diya gaya he taaki unke centre main pradhanmantri bane rah saken
 All the cabinet notes have been instructed to be sent twice to the PMO - firstly when the concerned ministry will send the note for consultation and secondly when the final note will be made after consultation
 is prakriya ke liye do saptaah kii samay seemaa tay kii gai he
 The PMO will have three days to view the final note and its copy cannot be prepared for further distribution in the meantime
 andruni sutron kii maane to vyavhaar main ho yah rahaa he ki mantralayon ko cabinet note ke antim sanskaran kaa pataa hi nahin hota or kai avasaron par yah piemo ke saath baithak ke dauraan sidhe mej par laayaa jaataa he or kuch maamalon main to aakhri maukey par isamen badlaav kar die jate hai jisase sambhddha mantralay bhauchak rah jaataa he
 Any minister or secretary can register his objection in the cabinet meeting but then he has to explain why he did not raise this matter during the consultation process 
 yah sab kuch cabinet sachivalay se bheje gaye ek vistrut patr main disha-nirdesh ke taur par bataaya ja chukaa he
 Sources said that apart from senior ministers like Arun Jaitley or occasionally Venkaiah Naidu or Nitin Gadkari, no minister normally speaks on specific issues in cabinet meetings
 har vishay par faisle main samay kaaphi kam lagaaya jaataa he
 The Cabinet Secretary reads the paragraph attached to the decision and it is approved without special debate
 adhikansh vakt agenda se itar rajnatik masalon par kharch hota he yaa phir yah pradhanmantri kii marji par nirbhar karata he, agar ve kuch bolnaa chaahate hon
 The PMO is directly involved in all important policy matters
 yah pehali baar hua he ki kisi pradhanmantri ke paas apane portpholio ke hisse ke taur par ‘‘sabhi ahm nitigat maamle’’ hai, jiske chalate modi kaa karyaalay sirf i-samiksha ke madhyam se hi tranjaction of bijness niyamon ke daayre main bana rahata he or kisi bhi mantralay kii karypranali main hastkshep kar saktaa he
 It was part of Modi's portfolio even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 masalan, gas sanchalit bijli utpaadan ikaayiyon ko kaam shuru karne ke liye jaruri he ki gas pooling mulya pranali kaa masalaa hal kar liya jaae
 The PMO has taken up the subject and is preparing a "joint Cabinet Naut" from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Ministry of Power as per their wish
 sarkaron ke kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he
 It aims to determine the value of gas by pooling imported and domestically produced gas
 hardam sanshay main lekin satarccabinet mantriyon kii girti mahatta ko is tathy se bhi janaa ja saktaa he ki adhiktar cabinet note piemo ke disha-nirdeshon ke baad taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Barring one exception, no ministry has so far proposed itself
 kai avasaron par mantri iske chalate duvidha main funs gaye hai
 Let's see a few examples: Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had nothing to do with the "make in India" campaign till the last phase
 yah modi kii pahal thi jiske liye udyog sachiv amitabh kaant or piemo main sanyukt sachiv e
 K
 sharma sidhe sampark main the
 When the Prime Minister approved the scheme, only after it was shared with Sitharaman and told what he had to say on the launch of the scheme
 gramin vikaas mantri nitin gadakari ko pradhanmantri adarsh gram yojana kii jaankaree tab tak nahin di gai, jab tak isaki ghoshnaa laal kile kii pracheer se nahin ho gai
 The program received Cabinet approval after the speech
 gadakari ko sirf itnaa hi pataa tha ki is vichaar par unke mantralay ne kuch kaam kiya he
 Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani was chairing a meeting on skill development that a notification was issued stating that the subject had gone from her to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports
 krishi mantri radhamohan singh un virale mantriyon main hai jinhone apane bal par koi yojana chaalu kii or vah bhi gaayon kii suraksha par, lekin ve pehle se hi itane satark the ki unhone is vichaar par piemo se paraamarsh karne ke liye ek sanyukt sachiv ko tainaat kar daalaa
 Only after knowing the views of the Prime Minister could he put the National Gokul Mission on paper
 khaadya mantri ramvilas paswan ne chini milon ke liye niryaat protsaahan kii ghoshnaa kar daali thi lekin unhen ise waapas lenaa padaa
 When the PMO and the Cabinet Secretariat asked him uncomfortable questions about this, he pulled back, blaming the "immovable" mill owners
 isi tarah, bhartiya khaadya nigam ke punargathan ke liye banaai gai cameti kaa adhyaksh koun hoga, is bare main khaadya mantri ke naate unhen koi soochna nahin di gai thi
 All he was told was that no minister could appoint or remove officers in his department if BJP leader Shanta Kumar left the head of the panel, Hongzetli
 haalanki diardio ke adhikariyon ke seva vistaar ke maamle main jetali ko bhi ekaadh jatke jhelane pade the
 Sources reveal that they need PMO approval for every appointment or change
 apni shuruaati cabinet baithkon main modi ne mantriyon ko rajnatik niyuktiyon ke khilaaf aagaah kiya tha or unase kaha tha ki ve khaali padon kii pahchaan karen, yogyata ke maanak bataaen or party sanghathan ke saath salaah-mashvira karke upyukt ummidavaar kii talash karen
 As this message has gone down, the pressure on the ministers has come down considerably though their credibility has also decreased
 ek mantri ke sahaayak ne bataaya, ‘‘aavedakon kii sankhya kam hui he kyonki ve jaan rahe hai ki mantri akele niyukti nahin karvaa saktaa
 "there was a case in which a cabinet minister went to an RSS pracharak for the candidate so that he would not be accused
 prakaash javdekar jaise asardaar mantri ke bare main khabar he ki unhone apane afasaron ko nirdesh diya he ki saare rikt padon ko bharne se pehle namakan ke liye soochna piemo ko bheji jaae-jaisaa ki neshnal board of wild life ke maamle main hua tha
 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is still awaiting a decision from the high command that the head of the International Cooperation Cell of his ministry will be an IAS or IFS officer
 goyal or anya mantriyon kii hi tarah unki bhi ek badi dikkat saarvajanik upakramon ke board main swatantra nideshkon kii niyukti ko lekar he
 After the removal of the delegates appointed by the UPA under the political guidelines, no minister is shortlisting the name as he is waiting for fresh instructions from the Prime Minister
 haalat yah he ki taqatvar mantri maane jane vaale nitin gadakari bhi apane bharosemand sahyogi vinay sahasrabuddhe ko gramin vikaas mantralay main nahin rakhwa paae jabaki paswan ko apane puraane sahyogi o
 P
 rathi ko sarkaar ke bheetar ghusaane ke liye bhartiya khaadya nigam main rakhwana padaa
 Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi also had to compromise on the selection of the name of the President of the National Commission for Women, on which the nominee of the party nominated Lalitha Kumaramangalam
 yahaan tak ki modi kii bahuprachaarit kareebi smriti irani ne bhi ab nijee prastaav rakhane band kar die hai jab tak ki unase vishesh aagrah nahin kiya jaataa
 This has happened after the PMO turned down his move to expand the three joint secretaries
 aresas kii ore se lagaataar banaae ja rahe dabaav or apane sangrakshak yani pradhanmantri ko prabhavit karne kii kavayad (jinhen ve ‘‘sar’’ kahati hai) ke bich pis kar aisa lagata he ki irani ko faisle lene main bahut dikkat aa rahi he
 Hundreds of files are pending for approval and close aides and former ABVP member Sanjay Kachroo are working day and night to help him in the case even though his presence in the ministry is not official
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ke karyaalay ke madhyam se aadhikarik dastavejon tak kacharu kii abaadh pahunch mantralay kii ankhon main lagaataar gad rahi he
 Foreign visits are one such subject in which the cabinet ministers are feeling weak
 har daure ke baad unhen piemo ko is par ek report saunpny hoti he
 Modi has made it clear in his latest guidelines that every visit, whether private or government, will require political approval
 kam-se-kam das din pehle is sambandh main ek anurodh bheja janaa hoga
 Earlier this period was five days
 sabase ahm baat yah he ki isamen baahar jane ke vistrut kaarnon par ek note hona chahie or lautne ke baad report jamaa karwaai jaani hogi
 Even secretaries have been asked to stay away from foreign tours and, wherever possible, junior officers have been advised to be sent
 natijatan, mantri ab is maamle main koi khatra nahin uthaanaa chaah rahe hai kyonki unhen dar he ki upar se kahin manaa na kar diya jaae
 Some arrogant campaigners, however, have started touring outside
 louh mahila kii jhalkaniyantran kaayam karne main prabhavi sanchaar kii bhoomika nirnaayak hoti he or is maamle main piemo kaaphi sachet he
 That is why every morning at nine o'clock, the Secretary of Information and Broadcasting meets with all the important communication units of the government including the heads of AIR and Doordarshan to decide how the Prime Minister will be presented in the media and what will be the day's activities
 yah kaam ab sirf doordarshan yaa akashwani ke jimme nahin choda ja rahaa he
 The Information and Broadcasting Secretary himself supervises it and reports it to the PMO, where he is often summoned to discuss programs like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, while the Minister concerned is not even informed of it
 modi ek-ek vivaran ko jaanane main dilchaspee rakhte hai
 For example, for the launch of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, they wanted kites to be flown in the houses on which the message of the campaign was written, as they claimed to have successfully done so in Gujarat
 yah yojana haalanki paravaan nahin chadh pai kyonki desh bhar main ise lagu karnaa mushkil tha
 For Modi and his office, the task of controlling and maintaining information media is of political importance
 soshal media main modi kii chhavi ke prabandhan ke alaava piemo main parade ke peeche ke saare kaam kaa jimmaa modi kii bharosemand tikdi pratik doshi, hemang jaani or hiren joshi ke haathon main he
 The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting continues to see that there is no disturbance at the government level
 pradhanmantri khud har shaam gujarat ke apane puraane sahyogi jagadish thakkar se media main ai pratikriyaaon par jaankaree lete hai jabaki doshi soshal media main aae feedback se modi ko avgat karaate hai
 Such direct control is reminiscent of the days of Congress-led majority governments of the past
 purv cabinet sachiv naresh chandra ne india today ko bataaya ki yah tarika bilkul indira gandhi jaisaa he
 He said, "but at that time this control extended beyond Delhi to the states and their chief ministers who used to get instructions from the private secretary
 ye log abhi us charan tak nahin pahunche hai
 Chandra, however, believes that there are some changes that were "essential for reform" as the PMO and Cabinet Secretariat's "co-ordination rights" were largely ignored in the previous government
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘jahaan tak mantriyon kii baat he, chunki kuch ko chhod kar baaki sabhi main anubhav kii kami he isliye yah jaruri ban gaya he
 But overall, it should not be (decreasing relevance of ministers)
 ve lagaataar pherbadal or cabinet main aane vaale nae chehron ko lekar sashankit hai
 On the other hand, despite big statements, the rules and procedures are the same
 to phir ve nattejey kaise denge? mujhe ummid he ki aage isamen kuch badlaav hoga
 Right now the situation is that the command is in the hands of the PMO
 ’’haal hi main britain ke raksha sachiv maaikel failan bharat ke aadhikarik daure par aae the
 In a meeting with Jaitley, he probably understood better what the real situation was
 baatcheet kii shuruyaat failan ne kii jab ve ginane lage ki margaret thatcher kii sarkaar main ek kanishtha mantri ke taur par unke anubhav kya the
 How she applied discipline and demanded results from young leaders
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki is bindu par jetali ne failan ko bataaya ki modi ke saath bhi aisa hi he, jahaan sara jor nattejey dene par he or isamen videshi sarkaron se vaade nibhaane kii bhi baat shaamil he
 If during the last ten years, the Congress has been trying to prove that it can run a coalition government for a full term - as its leaders like Pranab Mukherjee used to insist - in many cases it seems that In the Modi government, the BJP is trying to prove that it can run a majority government with effective command and control
 (saath main raveesh tiwari or anubhuti bishnoi ) Nitish and Lalu, who came together after years for the assembly by-elections in Bihar, today held an election meeting in Chapra
 chhapra main logon ko sambodhit karte hue lalu ne kaha ki nitish kumaar unke chote bhai jaise hai
 Lalu said that if the RJD and JDU combine the votes received in the Lok Sabha elections, this alliance has left the BJP behind
 unhone kaha ki bihar main bijepi ko vot nahin mili the
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar said that he and Lalu Yadav were always brothers
 bas kuch khatpat hui thi jisaki vajah se ve alag ho gaye the, lekin ab sab kuch thik he
 Nitish said that he is the only medicine to eliminate poison spread in the society
 unhone logon se jediu−argedy gathbandhan ko vot dene kii apil kii
 The JD (U) leader accused the Modi government of being pathetic, saying that the grand alliance of RJD, JD (U) and Congress would give 'medicine' to BJP from Bihar
 lalu ne afsos jataayaa ki maton ke vibhaajan ke chalate dharmanirpeksh shaktiyaan loksabhaa chunaav haar gayi
 Such a mistake will not be repeated now, as the three major parties - RJD, JD (U) and Congress - have come together to stop the bjp's chariot
 rajd pramukh ne kaha, 'bhaajapa dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke voton main vibhaajan ke chalate jiti
 
 (bihar main) hamane ek karod 60 lakh vot paae or bhaajapa ko hamase kam vot mili, lekin vah lojpa or araspi kii saajhedaari se siton kaa bada hissaa le gai
 ' lalu ne kaha, 'is baar ham rajd, jad (you) or congress ke voton ko ek saath laakar bhaajapa ko uski jagah dikhaa denge
 He attacked LJP President and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, saying that he did not see his (paswan's) 'kind of meteorologist'
 unhone paswan par aarope lagaaya ki vah vichaardhaara kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr apni raajnneetik jaruraton ke tahat paala badalte hai
 He said, 'he is a firm opportunist who changes his face as soon as he sees an opportunity
 ' The RJD chief reminded Paswan that he had resigned from the Vajpayee government over the 2002 Gujarat riots issue, but has now comfortably joined hands with the BJP and is a minister in the Narendra Modi-led government that was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 varisht congress netaa seepi joshi ne bhi is avasar par raily ko sambodhit kiya
 He accused the BJP of promising development to the people, but did not fulfill it and 'cheated' the people
 isse pehle rajd nit gathbandhan ke netaaon ne pashchim champaran ke narkatiyaganj main congress ummidavaar mohammad fakhruddin ke paksh main prachaar kiya
 Significantly, by-elections are to be held on 10 seats in Bihar on August 21, for which Nitish and Lalu are busy in the election campaign
 jammu-kashmir main aman ke liye bharat, pakistan or algaavvaadiyon ko aapas main baatcheet kerani hogi
 These things were said by former Chief Minister of the state Mehbooba Mufti in Aaj Tak's special program 'agenda Aaj Tak'
 unhone kaha ki har koi kahata he ki kashmir kii maujuuda haalat kaa jimmedaar pakistan he, to hamen usase baat karke is samasya kaa hal nikaalnaa chahie
 He said that when former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji held talks with Pakistan and separatists in 2003, there was a decrease in terrorist incidents and Kashmir became a paradise
 iske baad na to upie or na hi modi sarkaar ne us baatcheet ko aage badhaayaa
 Today the condition of Kashmir is worst
 kashmir main pakistan ke dakhal kaa zikr karte hue mahabuuba ne kaha ki jab rajya main 60 fisadi matdaan hua tha to hamane pakistan kaa shukriya adaa kiya tha
 Pakistan intervenes in state elections
 jab vah chahta he to matdaan pratishat acha rahata he, or jab nahin chahta he to vah 2 fisadi tak aa jaataa he
 If Pakistan has so much interference in Kashmir then we should talk to it
 pakistan ke saath hi hamen algaavvaadiyon se bhi baatcheet kerani chahie
 Only through this conversation will infiltration and terrorist incidents be reduced
 kashmir main sena ke role par bolte hue mahabuuba ne kaha ki sena ne apana kaam kar diya tha
 Political people had to do their work
 ham sena ke saath insaaf nahin kar rahe hai
 We did not work
 halaat kharaab ho gaye
 Who picks up a gun
 vah mar jaataa he
 His thinking does not die
 is soch ko badalane ke liye hamen baatcheet kerani padegi
 This is possible only when we negotiate with Pakistan and separatists
 unhone kaha ki jo kaam vaajapeyi ji ne kiya
 Modi could not do that work
 mujaffarabad road khulaa, vah aitihaasik kadam tha
 This had sweetened the relationship between the two countries and improved the condition of Kashmir
 lekin ab phir se baatcheet band ho gai or kashmir main maahaul din ba din kharaab hota ja rahaa he
 i appealed to Modi several times, but he said that i (modi) went to Lahore and in return we got Pathankot
 iske baad se unhone baatcheet band kar di
 i say if you have to talk to Pakistan 10 times, do it, because the solution to the problem of Kashmir can only come out through negotiations
 mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan dosti kii baat karte he, unhone kartarpur sahib coridor kholaa, sharada peeth kii baat kar rahe hai
 People say that there is a military behind Imran Khan, there will not be a good opportunity again when the Pakistan Army and the PM there are one, then talk to them
 safalataa paane kaa koi set formula nahin he
 Therefore to say that if you walk this path, you will get success, it will be wrong
 haa yah jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki safalataa ke liye mehnat hi ek aisi cheez he, jo sabase zyada jaruri he
 If a person is hardworking, then his fate also has to be bowed before him
 yahaan ham ek aise vyakti ke safalataa kii kahani aapako bataa rahe hai, jisane ek celsman ke taur par kaam shuru kiya tha or hindustan kii sadakon par daud rahi sabase mahangi car banane vaali company main diarector he
 This man had roamed 16 countries in 18 months by bike! We are talking about Pawan Shetty, who is the director of Porsche India
 pawan behad sharmile swabhaav ke vyakti hai or kariyar shuru karne se pehle unhen kisi se baat karne main jhijak mahasoos hoti thi
 After graduating from commerce, Pawan worked as a sales man at Financial Express
 or is naukari ne unki jhijak ko bhi khatm kar diya
 Childhood spent in poverty, now became the son of Majudar, he did not have any money in the beginning of the official work, so Pawan used to travel 8 km on foot
 pawan ko yah mukaam paane main 17 saal lag gaye
 In the meantime he did an MBA and worked with companies like Tata, Lamborghini etc
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar kocongress ne dilli police ayukta bies bassi ko tatkaal hataane kii maang kii thi
 Condemning the attacks in the Patiala House court, the Congress alleged that the 'jungle Raj' had arrived in Delhi
 adaalat parisar main vakeelon ne jeenyu chaatr sangh ke netaa kanhaiya kumaar or kuch patrakaron par hamalaa kiya tha
 Delhi Police failed to stop the attack on Kumar despite the Supreme Court's instructions to ensure security in the Patiala House court
 hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ko yahi lagata he ki kelaa motaa banaata he or isi chintaa kii vajah se ham kelaa khareednaa tak band kar dete hai
 But when you come to know how beneficial eating banana is for health then you will not be able to believe
 vajan badhane kii kai vajahen ho sakati hai
 This cannot be done only by eating banana
 kai baar motaape kii vajah anuvaanshik ho sakati he
 In some cases it is also due to lifestyle
 aapkaa motopa kele ke alaava khaane main lee jane vaali duusari chizon or aapke sharir ke metabolism par bhi nirbhar karata he
 In such a situation, it would be wrong to see a banana linked to obesity and because of this, it should be discarded
 aapako shaayad tajjub ho lekin kele kaa seven aapaki jindagi ko swasthya kii drushti se kaaphi behatar bana saktaa he
 For this, you need to eat only one banana every day

 Bananas contain plenty of fiber which improves digestion

 This hotel was built during the British rule

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne mangalvaar ko central board of diarect taxes (sibiditi) par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki uski ore se jari spashtikaran bilkul galat he jisamen gaya he ki durga puja cametiyon ke khilaaf iskar ke notice jari nahin kiye gaye hai
 Mamta Banerjee said that the cleanliness of CBDT has been introduced to create confusion among people
 sibiditi ne mangalvaar ko ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki media main jari aisi report galat he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bengal kii durga puja cametiyon ko iskar ke notice jari kiye gaye hai
 Mamta Banerjee said, 'I have come to know that the CBDT has presented a clarification by issuing a press release on the worship tax of Durga Puja committees
 ' mamata banerjee ne apane fasebuk post main sibiditi ke notice ko 'puja jajia tex' qaraar diya he
 Let me tell you, in the past some Muslim rulers used to collect tax in the name of Jiziya from non-muslims
 yah shabd tab se kaaphi prachlan main he
 Taking a dig at the CBDT, Mamata Banerjee said, "the cbdt's assertion that no notice has been issued for Pooja this year is in itself incomprehensible
" yah spasht he ki is varsh yojit hone vaale puja ke liye notice keval agle varsh jari kiye jaaenge, jo ki unki kar nirdhaaran kii yojana ke anusaar he
 So the explanation proves that the tax has been imposed, so why are people being misled? 'mamata Banerjee alleged that the CBDT statement was nothing but an attempt to create confusion between the local people and the worship committees
 is

 i do not know if this is being done inadvertently or deliberately but it is not good because people of every religion and karma are involved in our worship
 yah ek rashtriya parv kii tarah he
 Any such tax should be removed immediately and the festival should be allowed to be celebrated as usual

 On the question of a girl, Modi said, 'I will never become a PM one day, i never thought that
 sapane dekhne chahie, lekin kuch banane ke bajaay, kuch karne ke sapane dekhne chahie
 Ambition is like a burden in life

 kharaab pradarshan or fitness ko lekar haal main yuvaraj singh bhale hi vivaadon kaa centre bane rahe hon, lekin unke physio dow
 Jatin Chaudhary, revealing his weight gain, said that the middle-order batsman was barred from any kind of tough practice due to injury and then it was difficult for the cricketers to take time off from the hectic schedule of the IPL
 srilanka main 15 june se shuru hone vaale asia cap kii bhartiya team main yuvaraj ko ‘fitness’ kaa hawala dete hue shaamil nahin kiya gaya or unki jagah ipel main shandaar pradarshan karne vaale saurabh tiwari ko chunaa gaya
 Dr Chaudhary, who played a key role in healing the injuries to women's tennis star Sania Mirza and Yuvraj, said, "I was with Yuvi in the IPL
 ipel se pehle unki chot thik karne ke liye hamane unhen kathin abhyaas karne par pratibandh laga diya tha
 'he said,' Yuvi continued to play after recovering from the injury, which worsened his injury
 isaliye hamane unhen taakid kii ki agar vah aisa karte rahenge to mushkil hogi
 Weight gain is bound to occur if any player does not exercise properly
 ’ lekin ab unhone yuvaraj kadi training kii ijaajat de di he or yah dhurandhar cricketer subah nau se 11 baje tak yoga or gym kaa mishrit vyaayaam karata he, jiskaa asar he ki unhone ek hafte main chah se saat kilo kaa vajan gata liya he
 Dr
 regarding weight-related criticisms
 choudhary ne kaha, ‘yuvi ne kadi eksrasij shuru kar di he or iskaa asar bhi dikhaayi dene laga he
 They have lost six to seven kg

 'dr
 jatin ipel ke dauraan kings ilevan punjab ke physio taur par yuvaraj ke saath the or vah maanate hai ki twanti-20 toornament kaa kaarykram itnaa vyast hota he ki aadhe ghante ke abhyaas kaa samay nikaalnaa bhi mushkil ho jaataa he
 He said, 'the matches, travel and parties in IPL are very tiring of players

 ' uttarakhand kii mashhoor lokgayikacbutari devika haal hi main nidhan ho gaya
 In the first part of the article based on his life and singing, we learned how he gave voice to the mountain folk with his singing
 unke gayan main prakritik drushyavaliyon se lekar prem, viyog or taatkaalik saamaajik chunautiyon kii bharmaar rahi
 Due to this, he gained a lot of fame in Uttarakhand and Nepal too due to having equal society and culture
 (pehla hissaa padhane ke liye yahaan clic karen)kabutari ke gayan ke is pahalu par bahes ho sakati he ki ekalokagayikahone ke naate unke gayan main lok kis tarah se aayaa he, use badalane kii kya koshishen hui hai or vah kitna janapakshdhar rahaa he
 If we listen to the echoes of the singing of the pigeon, talk about the tradition of folk art of Uttarakhand, explore the contribution of the pigeon in it, talk about the destiny of the folk arts of Uttarakhand after they leave, and in the broader perspective of singing it as folk or scriptural form If we look at it, different opinions come in front of us
 uttarakhand ke lok main kabutari kii dastakuttarakhand kii loksamskruti, lokkalaon kaa adhyayan karne vaale dow
 Girija Pandey explains that folk singing has also been a means of entertainment for Uttarakhand's cattle-rearing and farming society, and folklore cannot be seen as separate from the lifestyle
 samaaj kii kathinaaiyon or ullas kii abhivyaktiyaan loksangit se hi jaahir hoti hai
 Culturalist and journalist Rajeev Nayan Bahuguna is a means to make it a pain of annoying life (jan Diya Bouzue Chhana Bilouri, Chhana Bilouri 
 
 ) maanate hai
 Bahuguna says that the more painful the life in a society, the more prosperous the folk arts will be
 vah iske liye uttarakhand or rajasthan ke sangharmpurn jivan or samrudh lokkalaon kaa udhaaharan dete hai
 Girija Pandey says that when there was no capitalist system in the mountains, in free time (dalit) artists used to go and sing songs to the people and get grain in return
 yah sashastitv kaa lok he
 The beauty of the hills and the favor of women were revealed in the songs of Kabootari, which came from this society
 pravaasiyon ke liye yah nostelgic anubhav tha
 Later, by changing the economy, the folk here changed as well as the nature of the folk arts
 vah kehete hai ki jab logon ne radio main farmaaishi geeton ke kaarykram sune to kabutari se bhi aisi hi maang hone lagi, unhone bhi ek kalakaar hone ke naate apane shrotaaon ko santusht karne ko hindi geet or gajalen bhi gaain
 Fellow of Culture and Media, Dr
 bhupen ne kabutari devi kaa sambhavat: aakhri intervyuu (saamudayik radio- ‘helo haldwani’ ke liye) bhi liya tha, jiske kuch maheenon baad hi unki mrityu ho gai
 Bhupen says that Kabutari singing does not have the worship of God or the songs sung at the weddings of the Lord class as compared to contemporary singers
 unka adhikansh gayan prakruti (pahaadon thando paani, boli casi mithi baani
 
 ) or viyog kendrit he
 The first voice of the original inhabitants of Uttarakhand was the emerging theater artist and litterateur of Uttarakhand, Dr
 anil karki kabutari ke gayan ko do deshon kii sajhi viraasat, dosti ke itihaas, uttarakhand ke rahvaasee yaa mul nivasee (dalit) ke saath hi nimna varg kii pehali aawaaj, tatkaaleen saamaajik paristhitiyon ke chithran, prakruti ke swar se saamanjasy bithaane vaali or shram ke sahautpaadan (byproduct) kii aawaaj ke rup main dekhte hai
 He explains that singers like Shanti Shah, Bina Tiwari, Bhasha Pant, Shanti Suakoti were active during the time of Kabootari
 kabutari in sabase badi gayika isliye baniin kyonki vah rahvaasee kii aawaaj baniin
 He broke the order of the women of Abhijana Ghar to come to the center of the songs
 kabutari se pehle uttarakhand main gopal babu goswami ne ‘ghughuti ni basa
 
 
 'gaia, in which' Swami Mera Ladakh
 
 
 ’ main apratyaksh rup se sainik kii patni kaa viyog yani madhya varg kaa chitrankan he jo lalit mohan joshi ke gayan tak prakat rup main aa jaataa he
 The exodus of laborers is also at the center due to unemployment in 'aaj Pani joon-joon' of Kabootari
 unka gayan bataata he ki keval poshit patiyon kii patniyon kaa hi viyog nahin hota, majdoor kii patni kaa bhi hota he
 Anil says that Kabutari take their singing rites from the society and culture of north-eastern Uttarakhand to western Nepal, so they have got so much love in both countries
 saamaajik antarvirodh yaa vidroh kii aawaaj gayabadusri ore, yuva ambedkarwaadi or marxvaadi adhyeta mohan aryaa kehete hai ki unhone kabutari ko bahut nahin suna he, lekin jitna bhi suna he, usamen saamaajik antarvirodh yaa uske prati vidroh najar nahin aata
 He says that even in Uttarakhand's Riturayan (song of the season), the Dalit praises his lord's class
 shaadiyon main (dalit) chholiya nritak ko paisa or daad to milti he, par khaanaa use kone main bithakar hi diya jaataa he
 It is important for Dalits to be insulted by this social discrimination
 uttarakhand kii ek lokkala- chholiya nrity ko bachaane ke liye bani sarkari cametiyon main dalit nritak ko chhodkar baaki sabhi log hote hai
 In this way, there is a loss of Dalit castes in the trade of labor and art
 vah kehete hai ki jis din savarna apni shaadi main khud hi chholiya nrity karne lag jaaenge, us din is kala ko bachaane kii chintaa samaaj ko nahin kerani padegi
 Dalitkabootari is important in Uttarakhand's folk life in that the life on the mountain in his singing comes from the same truth as in the stories of Shailesh Matiyani
 isi samaaj kii lokkalaon kii baat karen to ise aage badhaane kii jimmedaari dalit samudaay or mahilaon ke kandhon par hi rahi he phir chaahe vah riturain gaanaa (mausam ke aagaman or nai fasalon kaa kaam puraa hone par dalit mahilaon dwaara anaaj ke badale main savarnon ke ghar jaakar gaae jane vaale geet) ho chholiya nrity (savarnon kii shaadi or duusare khushi ke maukon par talwaar or dhaal ke saath dalit purushon dwaara kiya jane vaala yuddhatmak nrity) karnaa
 Apart from this Niyoli (songs of Viraha sung by Ghasiyaris (women who cut grass)), collective songs like Chanchari etc
 desh ke daliton ke mukaable uttarakhand ke dalit samudaay kii apni samrudh saanskrithik viraasat rahi he
 Dr
 anil ise chintajanak maanate hai ki baavjood is parampara ke uttarakhand ke sahitya se dalit or mahila vimarsh gaayab rahaa he
 He says that Kabutari got the support of All India Radio, but Shanti Suakoti, Parvati Upreti, Kamala Suakoti could not get such encouragement
 is lihaaj se, uttarakhand kii lokkalaon ke alaava saahitiyik jagat bhi daliton or mahilaon ke saath nyaay nahin kar sakaa he
 These arts are not the bearers of the emancipation of Dalits, Mohan Arya does not view the tradition of carrying the art of the artisan community in Uttarakhand from a positive perspective
 unka maananaa he ki lokajeevan ko aawaaj dekar kabutari devi kabhi celibrity nahin ban sakin, hameshaa garibi main raheen yaa duusare dalit kalakaar bhi saamaajik avarodhon kii vajah se ooncha mukaam hasil nahin kar sake
 Nor could the Dalit community revolt with dance, singing or art as their profession
 vah uttarakhand ke daliton ke sandarbh main kehete hai ki kai baar lokkalaon ko lekar atitagrastata itihasbodh ko paidaa nahin hone detii he
 He believes that singing, dancing may have been a means of livelihood for the Dalits at one time, but if today there are better options for employment and livelihood, why should they adopt them? At the same time, he says that if the folk arts are to be saved, then its responsibility should not be on the shoulders of only one community
 agar samaaj ko in kalaon ko bachaane kii chintaa he to sabhi virgon ko isaki jimmedaari leni hogi
 Mohan Arya further states that the Dalit community has failed to take the folk arts to the second stage of life
 vah udhaaharan dete hai ki uttarakhand main lohaar or chholiya nrity karne vaale (donon dalit samudaay se) ke haathon main talwaar rahi, lekin unhen kabhi iskaa istemaal (anyaaypurna samaaj main vidroh) karnaa nahin aayaa
 Kshatriyas always used it for their own interests
 vah kehete hai ki lokkalaayein apane swaroop main saamanti rahi hai, isliye inkaa khatm hote janaa saanskrithik rup se chintajanak to ho saktaa he, lekin jo samaaj in kalaon ko dho rahaa tha, uske vikaas ke liye inkaa vilupt hona acha hi he
 He says that such art is a sign of slavery, not the bearer of the emancipation of Dalits, because these arts are hindering their social and political development
 vah uttarakhand main dalit jaagran na hone kii ek vajah isi baadhit maansik vikaas ko bhi maanate hai
 The glorification of the folk is not right
 Second, Dr
 bhupen lokajeevan or lokkalaon ko vyapak pariprekshya main dekhte hai
 He says that Lok is not always exemplary or popular
 lok main angadh, pichhadaapan or shoshit vichaar bhi upasthit ho saktaa he
 He repeats the famous German playwright and scholar working on folk arts, Bertolt Brecht's statement that people often do not want to live folklore
 bhupen kehete hai ki isi vajah se lok ko mahimamandit karnaa uchit nahin he, use nai disha di ja sakati he, usamen barabari kii baat ho sakati he
 The public should neither be accepted completely nor should it be abused in its entirety
 unke mutabik uttarakhand ke loakgeet jis saamaajik dhaanche main bane, us dhaanche ko nasht hona chahie, na ki lokkalaon or kolgiton ko
 He says that without art and music, society cannot be imagined nor can it move towards modernity
 saath hi vah yah bhi maanate hai ki agar koi samaaj lokkalaon ko apni thati maanata he to ise sahejane kii jimmedaari puure samaaj kii honi chahie na ki jati vishesh par isaki jimmedaari daal deni chahie
 In the context of Kabutari Devi, we find that through her singing, she becomes the voice of the people of Uttarakhand, her society

 ’ 17 December: On the anniversary of the invention of the aircraft, this success of the Wright brothers, who made the realization of human aerial sighting by seeing the flight of birds in the same manner, actually fulfilled the dream despite four years of hard work and repeated failures The result of K's spirit was
 rhite bandhuon ne prithvi se akaash ke bich kii sarhad tod dene ke liye jitna sabar rakhaa vah beshak ek misaal he
 On December 17, 1903, at 10
35 am American time, when the Wright brothers were present with a new achievement in the aviation sector, an eyewitness named Daniel later wrote in his memoir how Orville and Wilbur Wright made their achievement
 Were surprised by themselves and called it a 'great adventure'
 avishkaar vaale din mausam behad thanda tha
 The wind was blowing at a speed of some 27 miles per hour
 phir bhi rhite bandhuon ne teen koshishen kii jo mili-juli santushti dene vaali raheen
 Finally, the fourth attempt was a hundred percent success, and after that 17 December was called the day of the first flight of the aircraft to the world
 pratyakshdarshi ne likhaa ki avishkaar ke 10 saal baad oliver ne kaha, ‘‘
 
 aaj main 27 mile pratighante kii raftaar se bahane vaali hawa ke bich ek ajanabi mashin par uske surakshit hone kii baat maaloom hone ke baavjood pehali udaan bharne ke bare main bamushkil hi soch saktaa hum
 Oliver said, "after so many years of experience, i am amazed to see the courage of our efforts on a new and untried machine in such a difficult situation
" avishkaar vaale din pehali or duusari udaan kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 After a gap of a few hours, the Wright brothers flew for the third time, which was dangerous
 chauthi or aakhri udaan kaamyaab rahi
 The aircraft weighed 700 pounds
 iske liye rhite bandhuon ne uttari carolina main ek trek bhi taiyaar kiya tha
 The story of the Wright brothers' invention of the aircraft begins in the year 1889, when Wilbur Wright, one of these two brothers from Ohio, USA, wrote to the Smithsonian Institution seeking information about the use of flights in the past
 iske baad rhite bandhuon ne pakshiyon ke akaash main udaan bharne ke tareeke kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya
 The Wright brothers looked at how the birds fold their wings after reaching a height, and how they use the wings to turn, move, or fall according to the flow of the wind

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati today said her party is theoretically in favor of the food security scheme proposed by the central government, but the way the government hurriedly issued an ordinance in this regard is wrong
 tippaniyan On a question in the press conference, Mayawati said that the Supreme Court had told the Central Government about two and a half years ago that there is no shortage of food grains in the country and it is rotting due to lack of complete storage system
 us anaaj ko aise logon ko baant diya jaae, jo bhukhe mar rahe hai
 He said, but sadly the center remained silent in this matter for a quarter to two years
 ab vah khaadya suraksha yojana lekar aayaa he
 Our party is theoretically in favor of it
 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha, lekin khaadya suraksha sambandhi yojana ko jis tareeke se jaldbaaji main adhyadesh ke taur par laayaa gaya he, vah sahi tarika nahin he
 Had it been brought in correctly, there would have been some good suggestions, if it had been discussed in Parliament
 
 
 
 But better still came late congress netaaon dwaara paanch rupee or 12 rupee main bharpayt bhojan uplabdh hone ke bayanon par mayawati ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki un logon ne kabhi garibi nahin dekhi
 If they had seen, they would not have talked like this
 jis tarah har kshetra main mahangaai badi he or uske kaaran garibon kii jo haalat kharaab he, use dekhte hue yah bayaan bahut bhadda majaak he
 We condemn it
 mayawati ne press conference main ek sawaal par kaha ki supreme court ne kareeb sava do saal pehle kendra sarkaar se kaha tha ki desh main anaaj kii koi kami nahin he or uske sampoorn bhandaaran kii vyavastha nahin hone ke kaaran vah sad rahaa he
 That grain should be distributed to such people, who are dying of hunger
 unhone kaha, lekin dukh kii baat he ki sava do saal tak kendra is maamle main chup rahaa
 Now he has brought food security scheme
 hamaari party saidhantik taur par isaki pakshdhar he
 The BSP president said, but the way in which the food security scheme has been introduced as a hasty ordinance is not the right way
 agar ise sahi tareeke se laayaa gaya hota, sansad main charchaa hoti to kuch achche suzav aate
 
 
 
 lekin phir bhi der aae durust aae
 On the statements made by Congress leaders about food available for five rupees and 12 rupees, Mayawati said, "I think they have never seen poverty
" agar unhone dekhi hoti to ve aisi baat nahin karte
 The way in which inflation has increased in every region and the condition of the poor is worsening due to this, this statement is a ridiculous joke
 ham isaki ninda karte hai
 He said, but sadly the center remained silent in this matter for a quarter to two years
 ab vah khaadya suraksha yojana lekar aayaa he
 Our party is theoretically in favor of it
 basapa adhyaksh ne kaha, lekin khaadya suraksha sambandhi yojana ko jis tareeke se jaldbaaji main adhyadesh ke taur par laayaa gaya he, vah sahi tarika nahin he

 The partnership with Indian Cricket will start from Apr 2017 for a period of five years # OPPO Haryana BJP state president Subhash Barala came to the media for the first time after he was accused in the IAS daughter molestation case in Chandigarh and made a big statement
 subhash baraala ne kaha ki varnika meri beti kii tarah he
 He will definitely get justice
 vikaas ke khilaaf kanoon ke mutabik karrwai honi chahie
 Mine and BJP have nothing to do with this matter
 baraala ne kaha ki bhaajapa aisi party he, jo mahilaon ke adhikaron or swatantraaa main vishwaas karti he
 In this case the law is doing its job
 is maamle main bijepi or uske netaaon sambandhit kuch bhi nahin he
 Let me tell you that Vikas Barala and Ashish Kumar chased the senior IAS daughter's car
 unhone ladki ke car kaa darwaja bhi kholane kii koshish kii
 Police reached there after several calls from the girl and arrested both the boys
 ladki kii shikaayat par maamla bhi darj hua
 However, Ashish Barala got bail the next day after his arrest
 aarope he ki aisa uske upar halake charge lagane kii vajah se hua
 During the investigation, it was found that Ashish Barala had drunk alcohol
 peedit ne is puure vaakye ko fasebuk par bayaan kiya tha
 However, the opposition, including the Congress, alleges that Ashish was saved by putting pressure on the police
 ashish, bijepi haryana ke adhyaksh or vidhayak subhash baraala kaa betaa he
 Please tell that there are allegations of tampering of Haryana BJP state president Subhash Baralake's son Vikas Barala Parvarnika Kundu
 maamle ne ab raajnneetik rup le liya or yah din pratidin garmata ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the victim Varnika Kundu and her father are openly exposed
 varnika kaa kahana he ki vah peeche nahin hategi or aropiyon ko sajaa dilava kar rahegi, chaahe koi bhi jo marji kar le
 On the other hand, questions are also being raised on the action of Chandigarh Police in the case
 pehle sisitivi footage gaayab ho gaye, ab police 5 sisitivi footage milane kaa daawa kar rahi he
 Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson, former London mayor and one of Prime Minister Theresa May's biggest critics, has staked her claim to the post of prime minister
 unhone elaan kiya he ki britain kii piem theresa me ke pad chhodane ke baad vah desh main kanjarvative party kaa netritv karenge
 Let me tell you that the bill related to the terms of Brexit (secession from European Union) in PM Theresa has been agreed to resign after discussion in Parliament
 wo june maheene main apane pad se istipha de sakati hai
 Speaking to the BBC at a business summit in Manchester, Boris Johnson said 'definitely i would like to go on to lead'
 jab unase bhavishya main kanjarvative party ke ummidavaar banane ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha jo chunaav ladega or jitegaa wo khud ba khud desh kaa pradhanmantri ban jayega
 Significantly, this time Britain is going through the biggest political crisis after the second world war
 kanjarvative party ke varisht netaa graham brady ne is siyaasi sankat ko lekar kaha, teen baar bracit ke prastaav ke sansad se asweekaar hone ke baad june maheene main antim baar is prastaav ko sansad main kanoon banane vaali cameti ke saamne laane ke baad pradhanmantri theresa me nae netritvkarta ke chayan ke liye chunaav prakriya ke liye time teble banane ko taiyaar hai
 Johnson, the former mayor of London, wants to take the leadership of the Conservative Party
 vah piem me ke bracit niti ke kattar aalochak rahe hai
 However, he voted in support of Theresa May for the third time when the motion was introduced in Parliament
 johnson kanjarvative party ke jamini str ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich behad lokapriy hai lekin unhen pehle apni hi party ke kanoon banane vaale saansadon kaa ghor virodh jhelana padaa tha
 The whole politics of Britain, which is set on Brexit, remains confused about Britain's separation from the European Union
 4 april ko britain ke house of comons main sirf ek vot ke bahumat se bracit kii samaysima ko badhaane ke paksh main matdaan hua tha jisko lekar pradhanmantri theresa me kii khub aalochana hui thi
 The Labor Party, which was playing the role of opposition in Britain, strongly opposed it
 britain ke europea union se alag hone ke faisle ko lekar samjhaute ko ab tak teen baar vahaan ke log nakaar chuke hai or yah chauthaa mauka hoga jab ise sansad main pesh kiya jayega
 Explain that this proposal of the government in Britain is strongly opposed while some people are in support of it
 narendra modi kii sarkaar ke shuukravaar ko 10 saal puure ho gaye hai

 Rejecting Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's demand for US intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said India would not accept it as the matter was bilateral and there was a consensus between the two countries
 unhone niyantran rekha ke paas lagaataar sangharsh viraam ulanghan par chintaa jataai or ummid jataai ki isse or koi hataahat nahin hoga
 However, he rejected the suggestion that this would end the temporary truce between the two neighbors
 khurshid ne kaha ki pakistan ko america se milane vaali kisi bhi aarthik madad kaa upyog aise nahin kiya janaa chahie jo bharat kii suraksha or ranneetik hiton ke khilaaf ho or ummid jataai ki ‘achche kootnithik sahyogi’ hone ke naate washington aisa nahin karegaa
 He told NDTV, 'in the Simla Agreement it was considered a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan and India would not accept any intervention on this issue
 ’ unhone kaha ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or kisi ko bhi us par sawaal khadey nahin karnaa chahie
 Asked if the ceasefire violation was over, he said, "I believe this is not correct
" kai ulanghan hue hai
 There has been a lot of firing with small arms
 yah asweekaarya he or nishchit rup se iskaa vipareet asar hoga lekin main nahin maanata ki is samay ham yah kah sakate hai ki sangharsh viraam khatm ho gaya he
 This will not be an accurate assessment of the situation
 ’ According to SM Khan, the then press secretary of former President APJ Abdul Kalam, Kalam wanted to step down after the notification of dissolution of Bihar assembly was canceled by the Supreme Court in 2005
 khan ne esoe vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, haalanki kalam anicchhuk the, lekin unhone adhisuchana par hastakshar kar die
 He could have rejected it, but if it was sent to him again, he would have no option but to sign it
 jab supreme court ne adhisuchana ko radd kar diya, kalam ne afsos karte hue kaha tha ki unhen cabinet ke faisle ko khaarij kar dena chahie tha or unhone apane pad se istipha dene par vichaar kiya tha
 Khan said, he even consulted his elder brother in Rameswaram
 khan ne kaha ki kalam ne baad main aisa nahin karne kaa faisla kiya, kyonki isse kai sanvaidhanik samasyaayein paidaa ho jaatin
 Khan is currently the Director General of RNI
 vah yahaan ‘sabase badi maanav aatma ke saath mere din’ vishay par vyaakhyaan de rahe the
 The then Governor of Bihar, Buta Singh, recommended dissolution of the Assembly in 2005, which was accepted by the Union Cabinet led by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and sent to the President
 kalam us samay moscow kii yatra par the or unhone vahiin is par hastakshar kiye the
 The notification was challenged in the Supreme Court and a five-member constitution bench headed by Justice YK Sabharwal ruled by majority vote on 7 October 2005 that the May 23 notification to dissolve the Bihar Legislative Assembly is unconstitutional
 khan ne kaha ki kalam aise vyakti the jinaki bhautik chizon main ruchi nahin thi or unke paas apana kuch nahin tha, chaahe ghar ho, car ho, televijan ho yaa refrisator ho
 He said that as a scientist and teacher he spent his life in hostels and guest houses
 unhen sirf kitabon se lagaav tha
 He insisted that he should buy his books and never took any book as a gift from anyone
 unka kahana tha ki sambhav he ki vah un kitabon ko nahin padhein
 Khan said that Kalam, who is particularly fond of technology, once informed the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he wanted to meet his cabinet colleagues as he presented him with a 'power point' about his vision for a developed India by 2020
 Want to tell through khan ne kaha ki haalanki pradhanmantri santusht nahin the lekin vah prastaav par sahamat ho gaye or raashtrapati bhawan main cabinet kii ek baithak hui
 Kalam gave a presentation for about two hours
 unhone kaha ki kalam ko ‘‘power point’’ prastutikaran se khaas lagaav tha or vah videshi ganmaanya logon tathaa rajdhyakshon se mulaakaat ke dauraan is par jor dete the
 Khan said that in 2006, when he met President George Bush, Kalam made a 'power point' presentation
 unhone yaad kiya ki prastutikaran samaapt hone ke baad bush ne unase kaha, sar, ise samajhane ke liye mujhe vaigyanik bananaa hoga
 But i will work on it
 unhone kaha ki jab kalam kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone vaala tha, media main is baat ko lekar kaaphi atakalein lagaayi ja rahi thim ki unase duusare kaarykaal kii peshkash kii jaaegi yaa nahin
 The comments tatkaaleen samprag sarkaar kalam ke duusare kaarykaal ke paksh main nahin thi or kuch raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ne unase nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa anurodh kiya
 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was fielded by BJP against UPA candidate Pratibha Patil
 lekin usne sanket diya ki vah apane ummidavaar ko waapas kar sakati he or nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main kalam kaa samarthan kar sakati he
 But Kalam refused to contest the election
 kalam kaa dharm or aadhyatmik maamalon main bhi kaaphi dilchaspee thi
 Khan said that Kalam often used to say that "all religions are beautiful islands but there is no contact between them"
 ’’ unhone kaha ki mashhoor vaigyanik kalam kaa maananaa tha ki vigyaan or dharm ke milakar kaam karne par bahut kuch hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Khan said while addressing the students of SOA University, although Kalam was reluctant, he signed the notification
 vah ise khaarij kar sakate the, lekin agar yah unke paas dobaaraa bheja jaataa to unke paas hastakshar karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin rah jaataa
 When the Supreme Court quashed the notification, Kalam regretted that he should have rejected the Cabinet decision and considered resigning from his post
 khan ne kaha, yahaan tak ki unhone rameswaram main apane bade bhai se bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya tha
 Khan said that Kalam later decided not to do so, as it would cause many constitutional problems
 khan abhi arenai ke mahanideshak hai
 He was lecturing here on the subject of 'my day with the greatest human soul'
 bihar ke tatkaaleen rajyapal bootaa singh ne 2005 main vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kii thi, jise tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh nit kendriya cabinet ne sweekaar kar liya or raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya
 Kalam was then on a visit to Moscow and he signed it there

 Khan said that Kalam was someone who was not interested in material things and had nothing of his own, be it a house, a car, a television or a refrigerator
 unhone kaha ki vaigyanik or shikshak ke rup main unhone apana jivan chatravaason or atithigrihon main bitaayaa
 He only loved books
 vah jor dete the ki unhen apni kitaaben kharidni chahie tathaa unhone kabhi kisi se uphaar ke rup main koi kitaab nahin lee
 He said that it is possible that he does not read those books
 khan ne kaha ki praudyogiki se khaas lagaav rakhane vaale kalam ne ek baar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko suchit kiya ki vah unke cabinet sahyogiyon se milanaa chaahate he kyonki vah 2020 tak viksit bharat ke liye apni drushti ke bare main unhen ‘power point’ prastutikaran ke jariye bataanaa chaahate hai
 Khan said that although the Prime Minister was not satisfied, he agreed to the proposal and a cabinet meeting was held at Rashtrapati Bhavan
 kalam ne kareeb do ghante tak prastutikaran diya
 He said that Kalam was particularly fond of the "power point" presentation and used to emphasize it when he met foreign dignitaries and heads of state
 khan ne kaha ki 2006 main jab raashtrapati jorge bush se mulaakaat ke dauraan bhi kalam ne ‘power point’ prastutikaran rakhaa
 He recalled that after the presentation was over, Bush told him, Sir, i have to be a scientist to understand this
 lekin main is par kaam karuunga
 He said that when Kalam's tenure was about to expire, there was much speculation in the media about whether he would be offered a second term
 tippaniyan The then UPA government was not in favor of Kalam's second term and leaders of some political parties requested him to contest the elections independently
 samprag pratyaashee pratibha patil ke khilaaf bhaajapa ne bhairon singh shekhavat ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 But she indicated that she could return her candidate and support Kalam as an independent candidate
 lekin kalam ne chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Kalam was also very interested in religion and spiritual matters
 khan ne kaha ki kalam aksar kaha karte the ki ‘‘sabhi dharm khubasurat dweep hai lekin unke bich sampark nahin he
 He said that famous scientist Kalam believed that a lot can be achieved by working together with science and religion
 khan ne kaha, yahaan tak ki unhone rameswaram main apane bade bhai se bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya tha
 Khan said that Kalam later decided not to do so, as it would cause many constitutional problems

 shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne dhamkee di he ki vah bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket match mumbai main nahin hone denge
 Thackeray has written an article in the party mouthpiece 'saamana' and has heard the BCCI scrambling to organize the series
 unhone kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket match yaa koi bhi khel nahin hona chahie or vah kam se kam mumbai main to aisa kabhi nahin hone denge
 In the party's mouthpiece 'saamana' commemorating the 2008 Mumbai attack, he lashed out at the BCCI and its officials
 bal thakare ne likhaa ki cricket jentalman kaa khel mana jaataa he, lekin cricket ke aakaaon ne ise besharm or barbaron kaa khel bana diya he
 Even when the entire country is against playing with Pakistan, the officials of the cricket board who invite Pakistanis to play cricket should be beaten with whips in front of the Hotel Taj and CST station
 tippaniyan Even after India played Pakistan with Pakistan during the 2011 World Cup, Thackeray criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for inviting the Pakistani Prime Minister to watch the match
 yahaan tak ki thakare ko maidan par pakistani khilaadiyon ke namaaj padhane par bhi aitraaj tha
 By the way, after 4 years, no match of this series between the two countries is to be held in Mumbai, which is considered to be the stronghold of Shiv Sena, but it is not right to ignore the threat of Thackeray, because when the politics of the playground If we become an arena, then any action can be done to keep our point
 2008 main mumbai hamale kii yaad karte hue party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main unhone bisisiai or uske adhikariyon ko aade haathon liya
 Bal Thackeray wrote that cricket is considered a gentleman's game, but the masters of cricket have made it a game of shameless and barbarous
 jab puraa desh pakistan ke saath khilne ke khilaaf he tab bhi pakistaniyon ko cricket khilne kaa nimantran dene vaale cricket board ke padaadhikariyon ko hotel taj or siasti stesan ke saamne kodon se peetna chahie
 The comments 2011 world cap ke dauraan bharat ne pakistan se match khelaa tha, tab bhi thakare ne pakistani pradhanmantri ko match dekhne ke liye aamantrit karne par pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii aalochana kii thi
 Even Thackeray objected to the prayers of Pakistani players on the field
 vaise, 4 saal ke baad donon deshon ke bich hone vaali is siries kaa koi bhi match mumbai main nahin hona he, jo shivasena kaa garh mana jaataa he, lekin thakare kii dhamkee ko nazarandaaj karnaa bhi sahi nahin hoga, kyonki jab khel kaa maidan siyasat kaa akhaada ban jaae to apni baat rakhane ke liye koi bhi harakat kii ja sakati he
 Even after India played Pakistan with Pakistan during the 2011 World Cup, Thackeray criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for inviting the Pakistani Prime Minister to watch the match
 yahaan tak ki thakare ko maidan par pakistani khilaadiyon ke namaaj padhane par bhi aitraaj tha

 saath hi mantralay ne rajya sarkaar nirdesh dete hue yah sunishchit karne ko kaha ki aage se is tarah kii ghatnaaye na ho
 On the other hand, former CM of the state Mayawati has blamed the Akhilesh government for this
 bispi pramukh mayawati ne 50 saal ke ikhlaaq kii hatya kii ghatana par kshobh vyakt karte hue kaha ki iske liye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or bijepi ke arajak va apradhi tatwon se zyada pradesh kii espi sarkaar doshi he
 Mayawati said in her statement, 'the SP government of Uttar Pradesh is more to blame for the tragic incident of Dadri than the chaotic and criminal elements of RSS and BJP
 police kii vifaltaa ke saath-saath pradesh main badtar kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti kii duusari misaal or kya ho sakati he
 He said that not only Dadri, but such communal anti-chaotic and criminal elements are actively engaged in spoiling the environment
 'sarkaar ko shanti kaa maahaul pasand nahin'mayawati ne aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'akhilesh yadav sarkaar naa to khud karrwai karti he or naa hi sthaneey str par civil or police adhikariyon ko apane dayitvon kaa sahi dhang se nirvahan karne de rahi he
 The main reason for this is that the SP government of the state believes that it can survive only in an atmosphere of chaos, riots, rape and murders
 kanoon vyavastha or shanti kaa maahaul use katai pasand nahin he
 He said that this incident has exposed the lax and unbridled law and order of the present Akhilesh government along with the mutual connivance of the SP and the BJP and the Sangh
 bispi pramukh ne kaha ki har jaghanya ghatana ko rupee main taulnaa akhilesh sarkaar kii khaas kharaab aadat ban gai he, kyonki use lagata he ki peediton kii nyaay kii abhilaashaa ko rupee main taula kharida ja saktaa he

 yun to ek janvari ko puri duniya main nayaa saal manaaya jaataa he
 But New Year is celebrated twice in India
 ek angreji calendar ke anusaar 1 janvari ko or doosraa bhartiya calendar ke anusaar caitra maas kii shukla pratipada se manaaya jaataa he
 This is called Navasvatsar
 aaj 18 march 2018 se navasanvatsar aarambh ho chukaa he
 While there is a cold weather on the New Year celebrated according to the English calendar, the weather on the Indian New Year is pleasant
 vasant ritu kaa armbh varsh pratipada se hi hota he
 Which is filled with joy, joy, happiness and the aroma of flowers all around
 fasal pakane kaa prarambh, kisaanon kii mehnat kaa fal milane kaa bhi yahi samay hota he
 According to Sun and Moon, the Indian calendar is calculated according to Sun and Moon
 mana jaataa he vikramaditya ke kaal main sabase pehle bharat se calendar athwa panchag kaa chalan shuru hua
 Apart from this, the trend of 12 months a year and 7 days a week is also considered from Vikram era
 in dharmik manyataon ke peeche chhipe hai vaigyanik karanbharat main prachlit hai anek kaal gananaayembharat main saanskrithik vividhta ke kaaran anek kaal gananaaen prachlit hai jaise- vikram samvath, shaq samvath, hijri san, isvin san, viranirvana samvath, bang samvath aadi
 On January 1 this year, Rashtriya Saka Samvat 1939, Vikram Samvat 2074, Veeranirvana Samvat 2544, Bang Samvat 1424, Hijri Sun 1439, but on 18 March 2018 Chakra Samvat 1940 and Vikram Samvat 2075 are happening
 is prakaar hindu samaaj ke liye navvarsh prarambh ho rahaa he
 The glorious and just king was Vikramaditya, in the Indian census, the most importance is given to the Vikram Samvat Panchang
 sanathan dharmavalambiyon ke samast kaarykram jaise vivaah, namakaran, grihpravesh ityadi shubhakarya vikram samvath ke anusaar hi hote hai
 57 AD of Vikram Samvat
 pus
 In the name of King Vikramaditya of Ujjain
 bhartiya itihaas main vikramaditya ko nyaaypriy or lokapriy raja ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Before Vikramaditya's reign, Ujjain was ruled by Shakas
 ve log atyant krur the or praja ko sadaa ksht diya karte the
 Vikramaditya liberated Ujjain from the harsh rule of the Shakas and freed the fear of his people
 spasht he ki vikramaditya ke vijayi hone kii smriti main aaj se 2075 varsh purv vikram samvath panchang kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 This is very fruitful, this time the type of Navaratrisamvatsar Vikram Samvat is also called Nav Samvatsar
 sanvatsar 5 prakaar kaa hota he jisamen saura, chandra, nakshatra, sawan or adhimaas aate hai
 However, many scholars believe that around 6700 AD even before the Vikram Samvat in India
 pus
 The ancient Saptarshi era of Hindus had come into existence
 hindu navvarsh kaa mahatvamaana jaataa he ki angreji calendar bhartiya calendar kii hi nakal he
 Even today religious rituals and marriages take place according to the Hindu calendar
 iske alaava shubh muhoort or mahapurushon kii jayanti bhi isi calendar ke anusaar manaai jaati he
 This day is also celebrated as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra and Ugadi festival in Andhra Pradesh

 Those who signed the letter of appeal to this effect include former Chief Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi, RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro, etc
, who have appealed to the mps that political parties instead of amending the law CIC can challenge the order in which public authority has been declared
 apil main kaha gaya he ki, ‘media main aisi khabaren ai hai ki sansad main ek vidheyak pesh kiye jane kii sambhaavna he jo artiai kanoon main sanshodhan se judaa hoga
 Behind this, the order related to the declaration of political parties of the CIC as public authority in relation to the ASTI is cited as the reason
 ’ patr main kaha gaya he ki agar vidhik praadhikaar kii ore se jari koi bhi aadesh kanoon sammat nahin he tab sahi prakriya use upyukt manch par chunauti dena he
 The letter states that, 'cic's order can be challenged through writ petition in the High Court and there are instances where such order has been quashed
 kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne aadesh par sthagan ke liye yachika daayar nahin kii or ab ve sansad main kanoon main sanshodhan ke jariyeadesh par apane virodh ko uchit or vaid banane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 'the letter addressed to all mps states that disregarding the legal order will set a wrong precedent and will serve to break the rule of law
 patr ke anusaar, yah kanoon aaj nagarikon ko vibhinn ikaayiyon se adhik sammaan dilaane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 It is important that the RTI law is based on the slogan 'our money, our accounts'
 isamen kaha gaya he ki sansad sahit sabhi santhaan ‘ham log’ kii ore se yojak kadi hai lekin inamen se koi bharat ke logon kaa sthaan nahin le saktaa he
 The letter said that by bringing oneself under RTI, no institution in the country will be harmed
