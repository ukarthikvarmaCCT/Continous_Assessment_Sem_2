 faruk ne jammu evam kashmir jan pratinidhi kanoon 1957 main sanshodhan kar parisemen ko 2026 tak ke liye roak diya tha
 The RSS official said, "we are with those who think that there should be more assembly seats in Jammu region on the basis of population
 hamen ummid he ki sarkaar unki maang par vichaar karegi
 "sources said that RSS leaders think that the government should consider delimitation of assembly seats, as Farooq Abdullah took this step with an aim to benefit political parties in the Kashmir Valley by keeping an eye on Muslim votes
 haalanki, simaaon kaa taaja vibhaajan (agar parisemen ayog ise laata he) rajya ke raajnneetik nakshe ko badal saktaa he, to bade aakaar ke kaaran jammu se zyada pratinidhi aaenge

 daagi netaaon ko satta ke sukh se rokane ke supreme court ke faisle par jahaan aam janata khush hai, vahi rajnatik partiyaan dhire-dhire khulkar isaki mukhaalafat karti hui saamne aane lagi hai
 Samajwadi Party MP and General Secretary Naresh Agarwal said in a special conversation till date that this is not a democratic decision
 is maamle main purnvichaar yachika daayar kerani chahie nahin to sarvadaleey baithak bulaakar sabhi dalon kii raay jaananaa chahie
 In fact, after the historic decision of the Supreme Court, all the guilty leaders are being scared of going to the chair as soon as they are punished, that is why there is a panic in the political parties
 aay se adhik sampatti maamle main court ke chakkar kaat rahe samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne aanan-fanan main dilli pahunchakar piem se mulaakaat bhi kar daali
 However, when Mulayam Singh came out of pm's residence, his tongue was locked
 sutron kii maane to mulaayam ne piem se supreme court ke faisle ko lekar baatcheet kii he
 This meeting lasted for about 30 minutes
 samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv or pravaktaa naresh agarwal ne kaha ki sattaruq party to aajkal kisi ke bhi khilaaf badi aasaani se aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla darj kara kar usko jail bhej sakati he
 So will the political life of that politician not end forever? kya ye loktantric rahegaa
 Shouldn't the government or the court think about this? khabar to ye bhi he ki mulaayam kii dhur virdohi mayawati bhi court ke faisle se khush nahin hai or wo bhi rivyuu karana chaahati hai
 Significantly, Mayawati is also facing many cases of disproportionate assets
 iske alaava lalu yadav, laalkrishna adwani, uma bharti, amit shah par alag-alag tarah ke mukademe lambit hai
 In such a situation, all parties are scared on the issue of guilty leaders, but no one wants to speak openly on this
 supreme court ke faisle ko lekar congress kaa rukh bhi saaf nahin he
 Party spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary said that cases of political litigation should be looked into
 court kaa vistrut order ham dekh rahe hai
 Only then will we be able to decide what should be done about the all-party meeting or review petition
 saaf he ki sarkaar is maamle ko lekar jaldbaaji main nahin he lekin jin netaaon par sajaa kii talwaar latak rahi he wo jarur chintit nazar aa rahe hai

 It is always expected from Apple that it will launch cheap iphones for the Indian market
 kyonki yahaan ke saadhaaran customers ke liye yphone mahange hote hai
 The recently launched iphone 7 and iphone 7 Plus also starts at Rs 72,000 and the top model of the iphone 7 Plus is priced at Rs 92,000
 yani ek smartphone ke liye 72,000 yaa 92,000 rupee kharch karne honge or isi vajah se zyaadaatar bhartiya yugers ise nahin kharidenge
 Indian users always have the option to buy cheap iphones
 ham puraane model ke iphone kii baat kar rahe hai jinaki keemten nae yphone launch ke baad kaaphi kam ho jaati hai
 Recently, the company has cut the price of iphone 6s by 22,000 rupees
 lekin kuch saal pehle tak aisa nahin tha, kyonki us vakt puraane yphone keemat or spacification ke lihaaj se android ke mukaable behatar nahin the
 For example, the iphone 5 sold at Rs 30,000 was not better than the Nexus 5 then
 lekin phir bhi appal ne bhartiya bazaar ko torget karke sasta yphone nahin banya
 Android can get a competition in the segment of 20-25 thousand, although the company does not even need to make cheap iphones anymore
 kyonki samsung or lenovo jaisi companiyon kaa market share is segment main sabase zyada he or appal ko isaki jarurat nahin he
 But in the high segment in which smartphones of Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 are sold, Apple can make its presence felt strongly
 or iske liye company ko saste phone laane kii jarurat nahin he
 Apple can give a tough competition to Android smartphones in the range of Rs 20,000 through its old iphone
 puraane yphone nae android smartfones ko takkar dene ke peeche kii vajah hardware or software he
 Prior to 2014, Apple lagged behind the small screen due to the iphone 4 from 2014 with the new iphone 6
 7 inch kii screen laana shuru kiya
 Apart from this, another iphone 6 Plus also came with a screen size of 5
 5 inch kii he
 Now it was the turn of these two to compare to Android and in this both these smartphones fell heavily on Android
 isse pehle tak screen sies ke maamle main android kii tulana yphone se thi hi nahin
 The company introduced powerful A7 processor in iphone 5S, after which the company also brought A8 and A9 processors
 is vakt tak android bazaar main itane fast procesar kaa opshan nahin tha jisase wo pichad rahe the
 Most processors were mediatek and Qualcomm
 haalanki samsung or huaave ke apane procesar bhi the
 But none of the processors were able to compete with Apple's processors
 fast procesar ke saath company apane yphone main acchhee screen, behatar camera, fast internal storage or damdaar betry detii thi
 In 2014, the iphone 6 became synonymous with a great smartphone and sold for over Rs 50,000
 lekin 2016 main top and android smartphone 2014 jaise behtareen nahin hai
 Currently, the prices of iphone 6 have come down significantly, but still it is better than many high end Android smartphones in many ways
 iphone main die gaye software ise banaate hai android se behatarcifhone 6 or iphone 6s ke behatar hone capiche isamen diya gaya softwarebhi he
 Because Apple keeps adding updates to its ios from time to time
 haalanki marshmelo or nae android varjan nugat ko google ne behatar karne kii koshish kii he
 The problem of Android is that the update to its new version is not available in all Android smartphones
 2012 main launch hue iphone 5 main appal kaa nayaa ios 10 kaa apadet mil rahaa he, lekin agar aap 60,000 rupee kaa nayaa android smartphone yuj kar rahe hai to bhi ye guarantee nahin he ki nugat kaa apadet milegaa yaa nahin
 a few years old iphones give a tough competition to many recently launched Android smartphones
 chaahe baat saadhaaran parformens or dizin kii ho yaa camera or duusare ap kii ho puraane yphone in sab main baaji maarthe dikhte hai
 In the coming days, iphone 7 and iphone 7 Plus will be available in all markets
 lekin agar aaj zyaadaatar phone kharidaaron kaa bajet 30-35 hajaar tak he to wo android se behatar iphone 6 jaise puraane yphone kharid sakate hai

 com / m2nnnrt2n0bataa den ki ek din pehle congress se istipha dene ke baad sanjay singh ne kaha tha ki congress abhi bhi ateet main he, or use bhavishya ke bare main kuch nahin pataa
 Today the country is with PM Modi
 agar desh piem modi ke saath he to main bhi piem ke saath hum
 i have resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership along with resigning from the party
 sanjay singh kii patni amita singh ne bhi congress se istipha de diya tha
 Sanjay Singh said that 'there is inferiority in the party, there is disappointment among the workers
 yahi kaaran he ki istipha diya
 He said that there is nothing wrong in the relationship with the Gandhi family
 desh kii janata bijepi ko sweekaar kar chuki he
 The Prime Minister is trying to take everyone along
 'vahiin, amita singh ne kaha tha ki 'ham log raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The thinking and approach of both are one
 maine isliye nahin choda ki vah mere pati hai balki vichaar ek-duusare se milte hai
 This is not a one-day idea, it is not a decision of resentment, if we have come forward for the nation building, we do not think there is such an opportunity in the Congress
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki modi ji ke netritv main aisa mauka milegaa
 It is a thought time decision
 ' Sanatan Sanstha has once again come under the scanner
 is baar vivaad sanstha ke sadsy vaibhav raut se judaa hai
 ATS raided Vaibhav Raut's house and shop in Nalasopara, Mumbai, during which about 8 bombs were recovered
 saath hi datonator or bam banane kii saamagree bhi mili he
 The Sanatan Sanstha was formed in 1990 by Jayant Balaji Athawale
 yah sanstha mukhyat aadhyatm, shiksha or dharm ke kshetra main kaam karti he
 Sanatan Sansthan workers have been facing many allegations before
 iske sansthaapak jayant balaji athavle khud peshey se hypnotherapist yani sammohan kala ke visheshgy hai
 Sanatan Sanstha has its headquarters in a village about 28 km from Goa's capital Panaji
 pichley kuch saalon se sanstha lagaataar vivaadon main he
 There was also a huge debate about whether this institution should be declared a terrorist organization or not
 is sanstha ko pratibandh karne ko lekar bhi vivaad kii sthiti bani
 In April 2017, informing the Maharashtra Legislative Council, it was said that the state government had also sent a proposal to the Center to ban Sanatan Sanstha
 tarkwaadi narendra dabholkar or govind pansre kii hatyaon main kathith bhoomika ko lekar hindutvvaadi sanghathan sanathan sanstha par pratibandh lagane kii maang maharashtra ke kai log, sanstha or rajanithik partia kar rahi hai
 There have been allegations earlier that the people associated with this institution were arrested for the 2007 Vashi, Thane, Panvel and Goa bomb blasts in 2009
 sanathan sanstha kaa naam narendra dabholkar, mem kalburgi, govind pansre or gauri lankesh kii hatya se bhi judaa hai
 The Maharashtra Police and the CBI, which is investigating the case, had earlier questioned its founder Jayant Balaji Athawale
 haalanki disambar 2015 main grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne rajyasabha ko likhit uttar main yah jaankaree di thi kii govind pansaare, narendra dabholkar or mem kalburgi kii hatyaon ke bich kisi bhi prakaar ke sambandh kaa pataa chalata ho
 There is no connection between these murders
 saath main unhone yah bhi kaha tha kii vartmaan main dakshinpanthi sanghathan sanathan sanstha par pratibandh lagane kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 These organizations, which claim to make India a Hindu nation, have been targeted by logicians and people due to many such disputes
 aam logon ke jehan main ye sawaal uthne lage hai itane aaropon ke baad bhi sanathan sanstha ko abhi tak pratibandh kyon nahin kiya ja rahaa hai
 Reservation card is not new in politics
 lekin bihar kii raajnneeti main is ore ek nayaa or nayab udhaaharan dekhne ko mila he
 There is job reservation for Dalits in many states of the country
 lekin bihar sarkaar ab daliton ke liepulice thanonmen esechao yani thana prabharee kaa pad bhi arakshit karne ja rahi he
 The weaker section branch of the police headquarters has also issued an advisory in this regard
 adwijuri ke mutabik, rajya ke sabhi espi or siaidi ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki jile ke 17 fisadi thanon ke esechao dalit-adivasee hone chahie
 Of these, 16 percent would be Dalits and 1 percent would be tribal officers
 kamjor varg shakha ke ediji arvind pandey kaa kahana he ki paryaapt sankhya main dalit afasar hone ke baavjoodathanon main esachaoke pad par inaki tainaati kaaphi kam he
 However, in this entire exercise, the police department is clearly denying the Dalit agenda
 arvind pandey kehete hai, 'rajya ke ek bade tabake main vishwaas kaa bhav jagaane ke liye jaruri he ki unhen bhi samuchit bhagidaari mili
 The police headquarters has also issued a list to justify this guideline, which clearly shows that despite having 17 to 20 per cent Dalit officers, their deployment is just around 12 per cent
 is list ke mutabik, patna ke 73 thanon main se sirf 7 main dalit-adivasee esechao tainaat hai
 Similarly, in one of the 13 police stations of Araria, three out of 20 stations in Sitamarhi, 2 in Navagachia, 3 in Lakhisarai and only 6 in Bhagalpur, Dalit-tribal shos are deployed
 baharhaal, chunaav se thik pehle bihar main sarkaar kii yah kavayad kai sawaal khadey karti he to vibhageeya chitth main 'sakasham adhikari' shabd kaa prayog bhi nai bahes kii ore ishaara karti he
 Film- kedarnathdirector- Abhishek kapoorstarcast- Sushant Singh Rajput, Sara Ali Khan, Pooja Gaur, Nitish bhardwajsertificat- u / a Ratings - 3
 5kedarnath se sara ali khan bollywood debyue kar rahi hai
 Everyone was waiting for the Bollywood debut of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's daughter Sara
 ab wo intjaar khatm ho gaya he
 Directed by Abhishek Kapoor, Sushant Singh Rajput is in the opposite role of Sara in the film
 to chaliye jaanate hai ki sara kii ye pehali film kisi he
 What is the film Kikahani? Kedarnath is a film that tells the same love story of Bollywood which usually appears in every other film
 ise kedarnath main saal 2013 main aae pralay se joda gaya he
 There is also a fierce battle between the two families in the story, with boy, girl, love, express, denial and then Iqrar
 kedarnathki kahani ek hindu pandit kii beti mandakini urf mukku (sara ali khan) se shuru hoti he jo kii behad ziddee, khushmizaaz or alhad hai
 Mukku falls in love with Mansoor (sushant Singh Rajput), a Muslim pittu (shoulder of pilgrims)
 do alag dharm ke logon kaa pyaar vaadi ke logon ko pasand nahin aata or phir is pyaar ko todane kii bharpoor jaddojahad shuru ho jaati he
 The twist in this entire story comes when a war between pundits and puppets erupts to break Mandakini and Mansoor's love, and in the meantime nature also wreaks havoc
 kyon dekh sakate hai film?film ko sabase pehle isesara ali khanke liye dekhie
 The thing that leaves the most impression on your mind after watching a movie is Sara Ali Khan
 sara nachurli jitani khubasurat or bebaak hai parade par bhi unki khubsuurati or bebaakapan saafe jhalkata he
 Seeing the film does not seem that this is his first film
 film ke ek ek seen main sara confidentor damdaar dikhin
 Apart from this, Sushant Singh Rajput has also worked hard in this entire film
 sushant ne shaareerik taur par kaaphi mehnat kii he
 In the film, he plays a pittu
 film main sara aurasushantke bich kai aise khubasurat lamhe filmaae gaye hai, jise dekhakar kabhi-kabhi sara main unki maa amrutha singh kii jhalak dikhaai detii he
 The cinematography of the film is also quite good
 vaadi kii khubsuurati ko tushaar kanti roy ne camere or drone se jis khubsuurati se filmaaya gaya he wo kaabile tarif he
 Weak Links: Talking about the weak link of the film, it is its story
 kedarnath kii kahani post he
 Also, the film does not have songs as per the need
 'namo namo' gane ke alaava amit trivedi koi khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa paae hai
 On the other hand, the story of the film is quite predictable and the climax could have been a bit better
 tivi actress tejasvi prakaash kaa whatsap acount hack ho gaya he
 The actress herself has given information about it
 tejasvi ne bataaya ki aaropee mere whatsap acount kaa istemaal ashleel video colls ke liye kar rahaa he
 Tejaswi said in a conversation with Spotboy- 'the person who hacked my phone is talking with my contact in a very friendly tone

 'agatejsweene said-' i called in the cyber cell

 Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' once depicted a woman who is breaking a stone with a hammer on the path of Allahabad in a mid-afternoon
 niraala kii vah nayika in dinon elahabaad se chalakar madhya pradesh ke adivasee bahul khalwa main pahunch gai he
 But there has been a slight difference with the time, because every hammer injury here is destroying not only the stone but also the pride of men
 'kuan khodna mahilaon ke bas kii baat nahin he
 It is possible that many of us agree with this sentence, but you have to change your perception after seeing the mood of women in village Langoti of Khalwa, a tribal dominated area of khandwa district
 ji haa, beete kai dinon se pani kii samasya se pareshaan langoti kii 20 mahilaon ne har ore se madad kii aas khatm hone par khud hi ilaake main 25 feet gaharaa kuan khod daalaa he
 Had to bring water from two and a half kilometers away, this village with a population of about two thousand has three to four sources of water, but they are insufficient on the basis of need
 khaastaur par bade mohalla main samasya kuch zyada hi gahari thi
 The hand pumps have dried up, so the women here had to fetch water from about two and a half kilometers away
 mahilaon ne apni is pareshaani kii har str par shikaayat darj karai, lekin koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 Even the men of the house did not support him in this matter

 shaadi ko lekar aksar ye baat kahi jaati he ki ye ek aisa laddu he jise khaane vaala bhi pachhataata he or nahin khaane vaala bhi pachhataata hi he
 Until marriage is not done, we keep speculating about this relationship by looking at others
 kabhi hamen ye rishta acha lagata he or kabhi ek bandhan kii tarah
 But it is not at all necessary that the experiences of others prove to be true for you as well
 har rishtein main uthaa-patake chalati rahati he lekin shaadi jaise rishte ko nibhaane ke liye sabase jaruri yahi he ki pati-patni samajhadaari se kaam lenour milakar har samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kii koshish karen
 Many things change after marriage
 ye kuch aise badlaav hote hai jinke bare main aapako koi samajha nahin saktaa or na hi unase ubarne kaa tarika hi bataa saktaa he
 Here are five such things that can be experienced only after getting married: 1
 agar aap akele hai to shaadi aapke jivan kii is kami ko kuch had tak dur kar sakati he lekin shaadi kar lenaa har samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 You have to try to overcome many problems of life
 2
 Suppose marriage is the act of connecting two people, but it is wrong to stay with your partner at all times after marriage, neither let him go without yourself and neither go
 ye sochna galat he ki har samay saath rahane se hi aap donon ke bich pyaar bana rahegaa
 With this, your partner can also be irritated
 3
 On the wedding day, both the bride and groom have a different noor on their face
 shaadi ke kuch samay baad chijen pehle kii tarah nahin rah jaati hai or ladkaa-ladki khud par dhyaan dena thodaa kam kar dete hai
 But this does not mean that at all, now he is no longer attractive or has remained
 duusari jimmedaariyon ke saath aae is parivartan ko sweekaar karne main hi bhalaai he
 4
 shaadi ke dauraan tamaam tarah kii kasame khai jaati hai ki hamaare bich kaa pyaar hameshaa bana rahegaa lekin sachai ye ki samay ke saath pyaar kaa rup badalane lagata he
 In such a situation, it would be better to be prepared for this
 5
 On the wedding day, hardly anyone would think that he would ever hate his partner
 par shaadi ke kuch saalon baad kabhi-kabhi kisi baat ko lekar kalah is kadar bad jaati he ki man main ek hi khyaal aata he, kaash shaadi hi nahin kii hoti to acha rahata
 
 
 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah' does not have fun with Jethalal unless there is a funny incident
 aisa hi kuch tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma ke aagaamee episod main dekhne ko milegaa

 In 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', Jethalal has another problem over Jethalal
 hua yah ki ek din subah subah jethalaal ko kisi kaa phone aayaa ki ve log uske ghar par dinar karne ke liye aa rahe hai
 They said that they know Jethalal and his family well, but Jethalal does not recognize his voice
 jethalaal unase puch hi nahin paata ki ve koun log hai
 But now he is in trouble as to who will cook for them
 sabhi se request karne ke baad babitha aakar jethalaal (jethalal) ke in anjaan mehmaanon ke liye khaanaa banaakar jaati he
 But Jethalal is constantly in trouble that who are these people who are coming for dinner by inviting themselves? In 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', when these guests reached Jethalal's house, they had masks on their faces
 koun hai ye log? kyon kar rahe hai ye jethalaal ko pareshaan? or yaa ye gokuldham socity ke sadasyon kaa koi prank he ? jethalaal ko in sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye mashkkat kerani pad rahi he

 ) a post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Aug 2, 2018 at 10:38am PDT a local Aam Aadmi Party leader has tried to slap Sanjay Singh by a local woman activist
 aaj subah aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa sanjay singh sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ke saath road sho kar rahe the
 Just then, a woman worker of an Aam Aadmi Party, with a garland of flowers in her hand, moved towards Sanjay Singh and fast towards Sanjay's cheek
 sanjay singh utani hi teji se peeche hatate hai
 At the same speed, Aam Aadmi Party workers push the woman back and she starts screaming, accusing Sanjay Singh and party leaders of getting money for the ticket
 mahila kaa naam simran bedi he or wo tilak nagar kii hi rahane vaali he
 Angry woman activist tried to slap
 iske baad tilak nagar ke sthaneey aap vidhayak jaranel singh ne pisiar vine ko 100 number par kol kar bulaayaa or shikaayat darj karai ki sanjay singh ko ek mahila ne thappad maaraa he
 There have been many allegations against the Aam Aadmi Party over ticket distribution in the MCD elections, but this incident of attacking a senior party leader is absolutely refreshing
 mahila ke hamale ke baad road sho rokna padaa, khub hangaamaa hua or media ke poochne par mahila ne party netaaon se baatcheet kaa audio bhi diya jisamen tikat ke liye paise kii maang kii gayi he
 According to Simran Bedi, she is making very serious allegations against the Aam Aadmi Party
 simran kaa kahana he ki ki wo kai saal se party se judy hai or party ke liye dilli or dilli ke baahar apane pati ke saath khub mehnat kii lekin jaise hi mahila ne chunaav ke liye tikat maanga to baat bighad gayi
 The Mahila AAP activist alleges that when she asked for tickets for the MCD election from Tilak Nagar, she was asked for money and even senior leaders of the party including Sanjay Singh refused to meet
 is baat se aahat or naaraaz hokar thappad maaraa
 Currently, Sanjay has not responded to the case
 ye jarur kaha he ki mahila ko thappad maarane se pehle hi roak liya gaya tha

 mumbai hamale ke doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke antarrashtriya dabaav ko dekhte hue pakistan ne islamabad main videshi pratinidhiyon ko hamale kii nishpaksh jaanch kaa aashwaasan diya
 However, India has called this investigation a mere excuse
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki rajdooton ko bataaya gaya ki pakistan kisi bhi sandigdh ko bharat ke hawaale nahin karegaa lekin usne sabhi ko aashwast kiya ki is maamle kii jaanch paardarshee tareeke se kii jaaegi or un par desh main hi nishpakshta se mukadmaa chalaaya jayega
 According to officials, several ambassadors also asked a number of questions to Qureshi and Malik about the investigation being conducted by Pakistan
 iske baavjood bharat ne kaha ki pakistan ne mumbai hamale ke sambandh main paryaapt karrwai nahin kii he
 Pakistan has taken a U-turn on the claim of offering talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Imran Khan
 pakistanne spasht kiya he kipiem modine padosi desh ke piem imran ko likhe patr main 'vaarta kii peshkash' nahin kii thi
 The Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman has issued this statement in response to a question regarding the news coming in the Indian media
 pravaktaa ne is baat par jor diya ki videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne yah nahin kaha tha ki 'bhartiya pradhanmantri ne vaarta kii peshkash kii he'
 But he had said that Modi mentioned something similar in a letter to Khan, as the foreign minister had earlier clarified, that "it can be taken forward only through constructive dialogue"
 'pakistan ke videsh karyaalay ne kaha kibharatake purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke antim sanskaar main shaamil hone ke liye 18 agast ko pakistan ke purv kanoon mantri ali jafar bharat gaye the
 During this, the Foreign Minister was also informed about the positive and constructive atmosphere created by Jaffer's meeting with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 karyaalay ne kaha ki pakistan sabhi muddon ko hal karne ke liye bharat ke saath paraspar laabhakaari, berok-tok vaarta ke liye utsahit he
 Taking a dig at the media, the spokesperson said, "any attempt to create controversy and disturb the atmosphere is wrong and against the spirit of responsible journalism
" 'haalanki, isse pehle kuraishi ne media se pehali baatcheet mempiem modi ke imran khan ko likhe patraka zikr kiya tha
 However, such a claim on behalf of Pakistan was immediately denied by the Government of India
 aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main doshi tamilnadu kii purv mukhyamantri jayalalita ko apane cese ke liye or intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Due to differing opinion of the two judges of the Supreme Court on the DMK petition, the matter has been referred to the larger bench
 haalanki supreme court ne maamle par roak nahin lagaai he lekin karnataka hycourt main jayalalita kii apil par surakshit aadesh ab tal gaya he
 While giving the order on dmk's plea, Justice Madan Lokur said that Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh was taking part in the High Court without permission, hence Jaya's appeal is completely wrong
 is apil par hycourt main phir se sunwaayee honi chahie
 He also said that if the allegations of the petitioner are true, then this case is an accurate example of how the accused used influence and power to keep the case derailed for 15 years and if the allegations are false then it is clear It took 15 years to settle the case
 vahiin justise bhaanumati ne apane faisle main bhavani singh kii niyukti ko sahi tehraaya
 He said that a lawyer is appointed for the case and not for any court
 isi ke saath maamle ko teen jajon kii court main bhej diya gaya
 That is, Jayalalithaa will now have to wait for a decision on her appeal
 haalanki isse pehle hycourt 11 march ko hi sari sunwaayee ke baad aadesh surakshit rakh chukaa he
 But now all will depend on the decision of the three-judge bench
 diemke netaa ambajhagan ne apni yachika main kaha he ki bhavani singh nichali adaalat main public prasicuter the
 He cannot be made a government advocate in the High Court
 jabaki jaya ke vakeelon kaa kahana tha ki sarkari vakil cese ke liye niyukt kiye jate hai court ke liye nahin
 a special court in Bengaluru has sentenced Jayalalithaa to four years of imprisonment in the case of assets over 66 crore
 iske khilaaf jayalalita kii apil par filhal karnataka hai court main faisla surakshit he

 When Navjot Singh Sidhu became a minister, there was a question whether he could be a part of the Kapil Sharma show while still in office? After this, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh took legal advice and then said that Navjot Singh Sidhu can be a part of the show even while he is in the post
 aapako bataa den ki punjab sarkaar main mantri navjot singh siddhu us samay nishane par aa gaye the jab vah pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa lene pahunch gaye the
 At the same time, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj refused to go
 vahiin siddhu ke is faisle par punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne bhi asahmati jataai thi
 But when Sidhu and Pakistan Army Chief hugged each other at the swearing-in ceremony, this picture also became a matter of controversy

 NGT lashes out at the Central Government: The NGT has once again lambasted the Central Government for what they have done to remove 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the last one year
 engiti ne poocha ki aapane kuch nahin kiya, sachai ye he ki aap kuch karnaa nahin chaahate

 centre yaa dilli sarkaar ke paas koi jawaab he?centre sarkaar ne ek arji lagaai he ki roj kii logon kii dainik jaruraton ko dhone validijal gadiyon ko di registrationase chhot di jaae
 The NGT said that why the MCD in Delhi has not been able to drive without diesel vehicles yet? Why DTC buses have not yet come on petrol or electric system? Do you have any answer? People's health is important or the loss of transporters
 Instead of taking relief from us, why don't you prepare transporters to replace 10 year old vehicles
 engiti ne kaha ki aam logon kaa swasthya zyada jaruri he yaa transporter kaa nuksaan
 People's health is also being harmed
 dilli sarkaar ne ab tak 10 saal puraani gadiyon ko sadako se hataane ke liye kya kiya he

 'citigen koun- enarasi banaam naagarikta sanshodhan adhinium' seshan main bijepi netaa chandra bose, AIUDF netaa aminul islam, jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ke angreji ke professor monojit mandal, supreme court ke vakil upamanyu hajarika or supreme court ke centre for research and planning ke purv pramukh krishna mahajan ne apni raay rakhi
 The stage was moderated by Rahul Kanwal, News Director, TV Today Network
 supreme court ke centre for research and planning ke purv pramukh krishna mahajan ne is vishay par apni raay rakhte hue kaha ki samvidhan main sabase pehle sabhi bhartiya ke paas moulik kartavya or moulik adhikaar die gaye hai
 Under the Constitution, we are obliged to make India an overall cultural heritage
 agar ham is par badlaav karnaa chaahate hai to use kar sakate hai lekin yah kiya nahin janaa chahie
 It is our fundamental right under Article 29 that we are free to choose our language, religion and our culture
 culture kya he ekadusre ke saath rahane kaa tarika he, isaki baqayada paribhaasha di gai he
 He further said that Article 29 also tells us to do a lot of homework
 yah chahta he ki bharat ke vibhinn saanskritiyon or bharat ke tamaam saanskrithik belt kii masping ho
 In addition, it also wants that everyone's fundamental rights are protected
 sabhi sarkaron kaa yah kartavya he ki sabhi bhartiya nagarikon ko unke moulik adhikaron kaa istemaal karne kii swatantraaa de
 Mahajan further said that today the whole debate is happening on identity
 ham ek raashtra he or loktantric desh hai
 We are culturally minority
 jansankhya ke aadhaar par alpsankhyaktaa kii baat nahin honi chahie
 It must be closed
 padosi deshon par baat nahin hona chahie
 That is why the demand today is who are the minorities
 kya isaki gananaa jansankhya par honi chahie yaa ise samskruti ke aadhaar par dekhnaa chahie
 It should be talked about
 ab saanskrithik taur par alpsankhyak tay karne kii jarurat he
 Today's demand is of cultural citizenship
 jo kisi raajnneetik dal dwaara nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Talking about Citizenship Amendment Bill, Mahajan said whether we need this bill
 aapke paas bahut saare niyam hai passport act jaise jinase aap logon ko alag kar sakate hai, to isaki jarurat kya he
 i think there are two types of talk on this subject, a political way on which it is being said that this is being done for the sake of votes
 lekin aapako dekhnaa hoga ki aap kitne baahar se aae logon ko naagarikta dene ja rahe hai
 On this, BJP leader Bose said that our real issue was to bring people in a stream line
 yah vot bank politics nahin he
 She does the Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee here

 Amicus said that the establishment of the special court of Posco and the special trend will be changed by the government lawyers

 paanch saal pehle jab bijepi loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye apana ghoshnaptr lekar ai to use kaarobaar or udyog jagat ke liye kaaphi anukool mana ja rahaa tha
 The business world also had high expectations from the Modi government
 is menifesto main bijepi ne bharat duniya kii ek majboot arthvyavastha banane or rojgaar badhaane jaise tamaam vaade kiye the
 Today, five years later, when the BJP is releasing the manifesto for 2019, we review which of these economic promises it has fulfilled
 mahangaai par ankushupie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main desh main mahangaai charam par pahunch gai thi
 Therefore, the bjp's biggest promise was that after forming the government, it would control inflation
 bijepi ne kaha tha ki jamkhori or kalabazari rokane ke liye vishesh adaalaton kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Due to all favorable circumstances and governmental efforts, it has also been successful
 thok mulya aadhaarit salanaa mahangaai dar farvari 2019 main mahaj 2
 93%
 haalanki, vishesh adaalaton kaa gathan nahin ho paaya he
 Jobs itself: In its manifesto, the bureaucracy promised to provide employment to the youth at large
 bijepi ne kaha tha ki shram aadhaarit menuphaccharing or tourism ko badhaava dekar rojgaar badhaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Employment exchanges were said to be converted into employment centers
 start ap india, mudra lone, skill india jaisi yojanao se yuvaaon main rojgaar ke avasar badhaane ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 But the Modi government suffered the most criticism on the employment front
 vipaksh rojgaar ke morche par sarkaar par sabase zyada hamalavar rahaa
 The Modi government was accused of hiding data
 desh main jobles growth hone yani arthvyavastha main tarakkee ke baavjood rojgaar main khaas badhat na hone ke aarope lage
 To bring back black money, the BJP promised that corruption in the country will be curbed and black money will be brought back
 bijepi ne aisa tantra banane kaa vaada kiya tha, jisase bhrashtachar karne kii gunjaaish hi na rahe
 BJP had said that it is committed to bring back the black money stashed in foreign banks and it will be done on the basis of commitment
 kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye ek task force banane kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 All efforts of the government to curb black money in the country have been successful due to Operation Clean Money, Demonetisation, Changes in Benami Act etc
 sarkaar banate hi ek task force kaa gathan bhi kar diya gaya tha, lekin videsh se kaala dhan laane main abhi kuch khaas safalataa nahin mil pai he
 In its 2014 manifesto, BJP had said that it will take steps that will reduce the npas of banks
 lekin is morche par sarkaar ko vifal kaha ja saktaa he
 npas of banks are continuously increasing
 saal 2014 main desh main bainkon kaa kul enpie 2
 92 lakh crore
 sitambar 2016 main sabhi bainko kaa kul enpie 7
 07 lakh crore was
 march 2018 tak desh ke sabhi bainkon kaa kul enpie 10 lakh karod rupee ke aankade ko paar kar gaya tha
 However, by September 2018, it has declined slightly to 9
 99 lakh karod rupee tak pahunchaa
 The government has given more powers to the Reserve Bank to intervene in the case of bad loans and a $ 32 billion recapitalization plan was approved in the year 2017 to fix the books of the banks
 kar vyavastha or jiestibijepi ne saal 2014 ke apane ghoshnaptr main kaha tha ki upie ke tex aatank se vyapaaree varg main hataasha ai he or nivesh ke vaataavaran par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa he
 BJP will prepare all state governments for GST and implement GST effectively
 bijepi ne is vaade ko puraa bhi kiya he
 GST has been effectively implemented in the country and a tax system has been implemented across the country
 haalanki, isaki daron main badlaav or tarksangatta ko lekar vipaksh sarkaar kii aalochana bhi karata rahaa he
 It is also alleged that the government suddenly introduced GST without any special preparation, which caused a lot of trouble to the business class
 pratyaksh videshi niveshpratyaksh videshi nivesh yani epadiai ke morche par bijepi ne 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main kaha tha ki epadiai keval unheen kshetron main laayaa jayega, jahaan naukari or puunji kaa nirmaan ho
 Where the infrastructure requires technical and expert knowledge
 yah kaha gaya ki bijepi chote or majhole dukandaaron ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhegi
 The BJP government has approved 100 percent FDI in the fields of defense, aviation and e-commerce
 pharma main 74 pratishat epadiai ko manjuuri di gai he
 During the tenure of the former UPA government, it was decided to open the way for FDI in multi-brand retail
 is faisle ke virodh main tab vipaksh main baithi endie ne upie sarkaar par multinational companiyon ke dabaav main aane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 But after coming to power, the NDA government approved 100% FDI in single brand retail

 BSP supremo Mayawati is currently not interested in Rajya Sabha membership
 ye baat bihar main vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne kahi
 Tejashwi was speaking on Sunday on the occasion of Ravidas Jayanti in Patna
 unhone kaha ki jaise hi rajyasabha chunaav kii adhisuchana jari hui, unhone mayawatiji ko phone kiya, kyonki unke pita rajd supremeo lalu yadav ne ek se adhik baar ghoshnaa kii thi ki rajyasabha chunaav main wo bahanji ko bihar se apni party ke samarthan se bhejenge
 The comments filhal bispi ke paas utar pradesh main itane vidhayak nahin hai ki ek bhi party kaa sadsy rajyasabha ja sake
 But Mayawati clearly told Tejashwi Yadav that as long as the BJP has a majority in the House, she does not want to become a member of the Rajya Sabha
 tejasvi kii is ghoshnaa ke baad saafe ho gaya he ki filhal bihar se rajd ke hi do sadsy rajyasabha jaaenge
 But it is believed that be it Lalu or Tejashwi, he wants to establish friendship with the BSP as the party has influence in many districts of Bihar and in some castes of Dalits

 congress kii mumbai ikai ke adhyaksh janardan chandurkar ne yah kahkar vivaad khadaa kar diya he ki un logon se desh kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan waapas le liya janaa chahie jo ‘sampradayik takaton’ kii tarif karte hai
 Although Chandurkar did not take the name of Sur queen Lata Mangeshkar, it clearly shows that he has targeted Lata
 haal hi main lata ne kaha tha ki vah gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahati hai
 Lata has been awarded 'bharat Ratna', the country's highest civilian honor
 yahaan yojit ek samaaroh main chandurkar ne kaha, jo log sampradayik takaton kaa gungan karte hai, unhen die gaye sabhi puraskaar or sammaan waapas le liye jane chahie
 He, however, clarified that he did not name anyone
 ‘‘meraa aarope kisi ek vyakti ke khilaaf nahin he balki (sampradayik takaton kaa samarthan karne kii) is pravriti ke khilaaf he
 Honors are given in our country, society sees these people as an ideal and loves them
 chandurkar ne kaha, jati, samudaay aadi se hatakar log inhen pyaar dete hai
 In such a situation, if these people (awardees) decide to support communal forces, then the honor given to them becomes meaningless
 congress netaa ne kaha, samaaj jin logon ko bharpoor pyaar detaa he, agar vah log raajnneeti main shaamil hona chaahate hai to unhen aage aana chahie or raajnneeti kerani chahie
 In a recently held function in Pune, bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi got a firm supporter as Lata Mangeshkar
 lata ne kaha ki vah modi ko pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahati hai
 Modi had inaugurated a new hospital complex named after Lata's late father Dinanath Mangeshkar, after which Lata said, 'narendra Bhai is like my brother
 ham sabhi unhen pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 On the auspicious occasion of Deepawali, i hope that our wishes will be fulfilled

 In its reply, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that if we talk about Section 370 and Article 35A, then both the cases are in the Supreme Court, so no comment can be made
 aapako bataa den ki amit shah or bhartiya janata party ne loksabhaa chunaav main jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 hataane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Kashmir policy has been at the top of Amit Shah's agenda ever since the government was formed
 grih mantri lagaataar jammu-kashmir ko lekar baithken karte najar aae hai, vah khud ghati kaa daura bhi kar aae hai
 This is why everyone has been watching it
 abhi kuch dinon pehle hi jab rajyasabha main jammu-kashmir main raashtrapati shashan badhaane ko lekar charchaa ho rahi thi tab bhi amit shah ne kaha tha ki har kisi ko ye dhyaan main rakhana chahie

 congress adhyaksh banane ke baad se rahul gandhi party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko lagaataar ‘ection mod’ main rakhane ke liye puraa jor laga rahe hai
 Given the public outrage over the incidents of Kathua and Unnao gang rape, the manner in which they called a candle march in a hurry on Thursday midnight in Delhi was shocking to the party workers along with the opposing parties

 is din party ne bada dalit sammelan bulaayaa he, yahaan se rahul gandhi 'samvidhan bachaao' abhiyaan kaa elaan karne vaale hai
 In fact, through this, the Congress wants to sway the Dalit vote bank on the one hand, and on the other hand it also wants to increase the pressure on the government on the court's decision regarding the recent SC-ST Act
 congresane essi-asti act ke mudde par hi modi sarkaar se adhyadesh (ordinence) laane kii maang kii hai
 On this subject, PL Punia, a senior Congress leader and considered one of the important Dalit faces of the party, says that the central government is anti-dalit or else it should bring ordinance to it, the party therefore connected the Dalit convention with 'save the Constitution' is

 Journalist Prashant Kanaujia's case has reached the Supreme Court
 is par sunwaayee mangalvaar ko hogi, lekin is maamle main kanaujia ke khilaaf aarope sabit karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear and the court will ask important questions on this matter to the UP government and the police, but it will not be easy to answer these questions because the police, without registering an FIR under several sections, allegedly without any warrant to Prashant The capital of UP was taken from Delhi to Lucknow
 yahi baat kai sawaal khadey karti he
 In addition to the sections of the law against which Prashant has been arrested, Prashant's wife Jigisha Arora has raised many questions in the Supreme Court by filing a habeas corpus i
e
 habeas corpus
 in sawaalon main pramukh hai ipisi yani bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 500 or iti act kii dhara 66 or 67
 Jigisha says that the provisions of Section 66 of the IT Act do not apply in the case of these posts as there is no obscenity or incitement material of any kind
 agar sarkaar ise adaalat main sabit bhi karti he to is dhara ke tahat adhiktam teen saal kii sajaa he lihaaja wo jamaanat par reeha ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, under sections 500 and 505 of the IPC, Prashant has not provoked people nor instigated any rumors by inciting any religious or ethnic sentiments
 bina warrant ke giraftaarivahin, sade libaas main khud ko uttar pradesh police ke adhikari bataakar prashanth ko mandavali sthit ghar se uthaa le jane waalon ne koi giraftaar warrant yaa exiaar bhi nahin dikhaai
 How police was taken to another state without presenting any transit remand in Delhi is also a big question
 aise hi kai maamalon main sarkaron kii ho chuki kirakiribaat siem yogi adityanath ke khilaaf aapattijanak post soshal media par share karne kii he lekin aise hi maamalon main ab se pehle pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ke cartoon share karne vaali ladki priyanka sharma par bhi aisi hi karrwai hui thi
 In such a case, the Supreme Court disposed of the case on the same day, on condition of releasing him and writing an apology
 isse pehle mumbai main bhi do ladakiyon ne aise hi post share kiye to vahaan kii sarkaron ne karrwai karte hue aropiyon ko jail main daal diya gaya tha
 But all were released by the governments after the intervention of the courts
 aise hi maamle main cartoonist aseem trivedi kii giraftaar par bhi sarkaar kii kirakiri hui thi
 Ultimately, all governments released those accused because allegations of power and round-the-clock arguments could not stand the sharp and straightforward questions of the court

 On the third day of this incident, the police arrested 3 miscreants
 lekin satendra police ko chakma dekar bhaag niklaa tha
 After which the police had announced a reward of 10 thousand on Satendra

 ham isamen shaamil hone nahin ja rahe hai
 We need to know what we are expected to do and pay attention to it
 unhone kaha, yah sab cricket kaa hissaa he or hamen ise sweekaar karnaa hoga

" maine kaaphi acchhee ballebaaji kii he
 Sometimes there are no situations when you can play smoky cricket
 bangladesh ke khilaaf match main is tarah kii sthiti thi, lekin mujhe ballebaaji karne ko nahin mili
 He said, if you are batting at number five, sixth or seventh, then if the top order makes a big score, then you don't get to bat too much
 mujhe lagata he ki (australia ke khilaaf) pichhlaa match adarsh tha, lekin gend sidhe kshetrarakshak ke haath main chali gai
 Everything is not always according to you
 form chintaa kaa vishay nahin he
 Asked if all the players in the team were fit, Dhoni said, "all the players are looking fit right now
" aashaa he ki ve feet rahenge
 When asked if Dhoni was his biggest match as a captain, Dhoni said he did not believe in comparison
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, cricketer ke jivan main kai maukey aate hai, isamen koi shaq nahin he ki yah mahatvapurn he
 After a few years you forget it

 Three years have passed, every match is different
 unhone kaha, yah 50 over kaa match he, aapako isamen apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa hota he
 You have to maintain passion for 100 overs to win the match
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki is mukaable se ekaagratha par asar padegaa, lekin main sochataa hum ki ham kaise raajnneetik badlaav laane main madad kar sakate hai
 i am tasked to lead the team and i will do it to the best of my ability

 In three of the four states - Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress sweep has been cleared, while in Chhattisgarh too, BJP has won
 party sutron ne jor dekar kaha ki sonia gandhi ke janmdin par kisi khaas samaaroh ke yojit nahin hone ke faisle kaa vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon se koi sambandh nahin he
 The country has five days of state mourning since Friday in honor of the late South African leader
 party sonia ke janmdin par samaaroh yojit nahin karne ke peeche bhale hi koi bhi kaaran ginaae lekin chaaron rajyon main congress kii haar nishchit taur par congress ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab he
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi herself and Vice President Rahul Gandhi came to the media at around 5 pm on Sunday evening and admitted their defeat
 iske baad sonia gandhi ne kaha ki is haar kaa puraa vishleshan karne ke baad jaruri ection liya jayega
 Sonia Gandhi said, 'thank you
 na sirf chunavi rajya, balki duusare rajyon main bhi kaaryakartaaon ne bahut mehnat kii
 Talk is needed at the national level
 hamen un tamaam kaarnon kii padtaal kerani hogi, jinke chalate ham chunaav haare
 We have to see why our message did not reach the people
 dekhnaa hoga ki sanghathan main kahaan kami rahi, chunaav ke lihaaj se
 'sonia Gandhi also said,' There will be many reasons for the defeat
 log naakhush hai
 Otherwise, why would such results come? mahangaai ek mudda tha, jisase log prabhavit ho rahe the
 In Rajasthan, we felt that Gehlot ran some very good programs
 magar ab sawalia nishaan he
 We have been in government in Delhi three times
 bahut acha kaam kiya
 But people told something else
 ham gambhirtha ke saath aatmamanthan karenge or galati sudhaarney ke liye kadam uthaaenge
 However, Sonia Gandhi also said that in order to comfort her workers, the Lok Sabha elections are different, so there is no need to panic with the results of the assembly
 sonia ne kaha, ‘loksabhaa ke chunaav kaaphi alag hote hai
 People focus on personality and state leaders in state elections
 aam chunaav main log us vyakti ko dekhte hai, jo desh kaa netritv karegaa
 Issues are also different

 The Congress asked for a report under the leadership of Congress in-charge of Jharkhand, RPN Singh

 If sources are to be believed, JVM president, former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi, does not want to enter the electoral fray under the leadership of Hemant Soren in any way, as he feels that projecting someone and contesting the election could harm the alliance
 kai siton par fansaa he penchmahagathbandhan ke bich seat shering ko lekar bhi pench fanse hue hai
 Ghatshila, Gandey, Jamtara, Panki and Vishrampur assembly seats of the state are such, where both JMM and Congress have equal claim

 Apart from this, there are many seats in Santhal Pargana where the matter is complicated between JMM and JVM

 Central Road Transport and Highway Minister Nitin Gadkari said that through GST, we are bringing the economy to number-one and this will eliminate those who work number-two in the business
 gadakari jiesti conklev ke paanchaven satr jiesti ride on tex hive main anjana om kashyap ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Gadkari rejected the idea of rising inflation from the GST and said that among the things that have been taxed at 28 per cent, it will have to be seen first how much tax was levied on them, including 17 tax and 22 per cent cess till now
 agar donon main bahut zyada antar he tabhi kaha ja saktaa he ki jiesti se wo cheez mahangi hogi
 Gadkari said that we will not work under the pressure of media, we will not work under the pressure of any sector
 vyapaaree bandhu do maheene ruken

 ye shuruyaat he
 If we make a mistake, we will improve

 Gadkari said that through GST, the government has canceled 17 taxes and 22 cesses
 ek-ek ko inspector takalif detaa tha, usase jo raahat mil rahi he uski charchaa koi nahin kar rahaa
 On the issue of increasing taxes on packaged food items, Gadkari said that the country's lower middle class and lower class does not use packaged food
 hair middle class hi iskaa istemaal karte hai
 Therefore, it would not be right to say that GST will have any negative effect on the poor man's plate
 gadakari ne kaha ki ham videshi nivesh chaahate hai lekin un sectoron main chaahate hai jahaan ham khud nahin hai jaiseimphrastracchar

 This is in the national interest, some people have become politically unemployed, so their compulsion is to protest, they should leave

 The results of the Lok Sabha election 2019 have shattered all the political dreams of SP President Akhilesh Yadav
 2017 main congress ke saath or 2019 main basapa ke saath gathbandhan kaa prayog karnaa unke liye galat sabit hua he
 Under Akhilesh's leadership, the SP is once again standing at the same stage where his father Mulayam Singh Yadav started 27 years ago by laying the foundation of the party
 yahi vajah he ki haar ke sadame ko peeche chhodkar akhilesh yadav soobe kii jameen par utarkar apni image ko badalane kii kavayad main jute gaye hai
 After the alliance with the BSP in the Lok Sabha elections, the SP was fully confident of a spectacular performance, but the mathematics of the alliance collapsed such that the SP reached its worst phase ever
 is haar ke baad akhilesh yadav ke netritv par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 Party leaders are talking to Dabi Juban on alliances from seat sharing to seat sharing, while his opponents are openly quipping
 naam na chhapane kii shart par sapa ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki akhilesh yadav puri tarah se jameen se cat gaye the or lakhanu main baithkar soshal media ke jariye chunavi jang jeetne kaa sapana sanjoe hue the
 As a result, the party's base was completely eroded in the election
 iske alaava akhilesh yadav aadhaar viheen netaaon se ghire hue hai
 Akhilesh Yadav has started the exercise to change his image after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and BSP supremo Mayawati
 akhilesh ne apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen ko waapas paane ke liye janata ke bich main janaa shuru kar diya he
 In this episode, he first met the families of SP District Panchayat member Vijay Yadav alias Pappu in Ghazipur
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vijay yadav kii hatya kar di gai thi
 After this, Akhilesh Yadav met and comforted the families of the people who died of poisonous liquor in Barabanki
 iske baad lakhanu lautate samay akhilesh yadav kaa kafila jaise hi ramnagar ilaake kii kesaripur railway crossing par pahunchaa, unka kafila achaanak sadak ke kinare thele par bhutta bech rahe ek vyakti ko dekh kar ruk gaya
 Akhilesh asked the handler of the bhutta and said that where is this bhutta from the hand, the thief replied that it is from Bahraich
 is par akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki meetha he or kitne main bech rahe ho
 The handler politely replied that yes sweet and sold it for ten rupees
 akhilesh ne tapaak se kaha ki bahut mahangaa de rahe ho or agar meetha nahin hua to isaki vaapasi to hogi nahin
 Then Akhilesh took a corn from him and sat in his car and started eating
 darasal sapa 2017 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle mulaayam ke parivaar main hui raar ke baad sanghathan bhi neeche ke str par khaanchon main bant gaya
 In the last two years, there has been no significant effort to bridge this gap and take them into confidence
 party ke tamaam puraane chehre bhi kinare yaa niskriy pade rahe
 It was a loss in the election
 isliye ab har jile main sanghathan ke vafaadaar chehron ko aage badhaakar jameen thik karne par taiyaari he
 Akhilesh himself will understand the grievances and grievances of the access workers in the districts, based on that, he will formulate further strategies
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh yadav haar ke baad manthan karne ke bajaay khud jameen par utarkar apni image badalane kii ranneeti ke tahat peediton ke ghar pahunch rahe hai taaki unhen lakhanu tak simit karke na dekha jaae or 2022 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye vah janata ke bich main pahunch bana saken
 Let us tell that Akhilesh Yadav traveled the entire state by bicycle before the 2012 assembly elections
 unke is prachaar ke baad unhone na keval kaaryakartaaon main josh jagaaya balki basapa kii soshal ejineering ko maat dekar apni party ko jabardast jeet dilaai thi
 Along with this, he was also the heir to the political legacy of his father and former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav

 com / 9xhl4fnpmf jharkhand main bheed hi adaalat hoti ja rahi he
 Sometimes against any religion in the name of religion, sometimes against anyone
 kahin haleem or naeem ko bheed ne maar diya to kahin gautam kumaar or gangesh kumaar ko bhi bheed ne maar diya
 Could it be that a group is testing whether a mob can kill someone due to different rumors
 kabhi yah bheed gaay ke naam par ban ja rahi he to ab sunne main aa rahaa he ki baccha chori ke naam par ban rahi he
 This question should be seriously thought about whether the group of rumors on whatsapp is making a rumor to test how stupid people really are, and in which cases they can be turned into murderers by shaking like sheep of the crowd
 aisi bheed ke saamne prashasan bhi bebas nazar aata he
 There is something that neither the administration is understanding the politics of this mob nor society nor politics
 jharkhand main baccha chori kii ghatana hogi to police kaa kaam he pakadana yaa bheed kisi ko bhi shaq ke aadhaar par gher kar maar degi
 Recently many such incidents have happened in Jharkhand
 saraayaklan kharasaavaan zila he jharkhand main
 Four people were beaten to death in the morning in Rajnagar here on suspicion of child theft
 sabhi musalmaan the or kaarobaari the
 See the courage of the crowd that all four were murdered by taking them to different places
 ek kii hatya shobhapur main, duusare kii dandu, tisare vyakti kaa shav sosomali gaanv main mila, jabaki chauthe vyakti kaa shav dhobo dungri ke jangal main mila
 Haldipokhar residents Sheikh Haleem, Mohammad Naeem, Sajjad and Siraj were going towards Rajnagar at 2 pm
 achaanak unki car rokane kii koshish kii gai
 Fearing, he moved to a relative's house in the neighboring village
 lekin bheed vahaan bhi pahunchi, sidhi dhamkee di gai kii sabko saunp do nahin to puure ghar ko aag laga denge
 The four took the mob with them and then murdered
 itani himmat logon main kahaan se aa rahi he ki ve kisi ko ghar se nikaal kar le jate hai or jahaan chaahate hai vahaan gher kar maar dete hai
 In this work, we only see the dead, do not see that in this mob politics our youth are becoming killers
 hindustan akhbaar ke varisht patrkaar anis khan ne jo jaankaree vahaan logon se baat kar bataai wo vaaki khataranaak he
 The whatsapp group was formed on the rumor of child theft, then a group of youths were formed and the issue of child theft started spreading
 yahi is samasya kii jad ho sakati he, kya koi group he jo alag alag afvaahon ke zariye yah test kar rahaa he ki bheed kisi ko gher kar maar sakati he yaa nahin
 Till now we have seen it as a mob that surrounded Muslims and killed them but Gautam Kumar Verma, Vikas Kumar Verma and his friend Gangesh Kumar have also fallen victim to this mob
 yah ghatana 18 may kii raat kii he
 Gautam Kumar Verma of Jugasalai, Vikas Kumar Verma and his friend Gangesh Kumar were beaten to death in Nagadih village of Bagbeda on charges of child theft
 yahi nahin, 65 saal kii ramchandra devi kii buree tarah pitayee kii gai
 His condition is critical
 gautam or vikaas sage bhai hai
 His third brother Uttam was also caught by the mob, but he managed to escape
 uttam ne hi bataaya ki bheed ne unase poochtacha kii or achaanak baccha chor kii baat kahkar unpar hamalaa bol diya gaya
 All the newspapers of Jharkhand are full of these news
 inhen se pataa chalata he ki gautam or vikaas ko pehle bijli ke khambhe se baandhakar peeta gaya
 People from nearby villages had gathered there in large numbers
 hairaani kii baat he ki itani badi sankhya main log jute rahe magar kisi ne roka nahin
 Thanedar Sahab arrived at half past eight, tried to convince the crowd, but was also attacked by the police
 thanedaar ghayal ho gaye
 Finally reached the city SP at 10 o'clock, then the action started
 tab tak gautam vikaas or gangesh kii hatya ho chuki thi
 There is something that can no longer be ignored
 hamen dekhnaa hi chahie ki yah bheed kis pattern par ban rahi he, koun he jo bheed bana rahaa he
 Not only through rumors of child theft, but also by making various allegations, the mob has taken the law into their own hands and committed murder
 hamaare sahyogi harivansh ne bataaya ki jharkhand main lagaataar aise maamle badhate ja rahe he
 Most of the Muslims are also in it, but the crowd has not left the other community
 kolhan pramandal jisamen paanch zile hai, vahaan 8 logon kii hatya ho chuki he
 If we talk about the whole of Jharkhand, so far 18 people have been murdered in the name of rumor
 pichley maheene bokaro main shamsuddin kii bheed ne pitayee kii or aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan unki maut ho gai
 The comments 2 may 2017 : dumriya main 60 saal ke buzurg kii isi tarah hatya kar di gai thi May 2: John Anthony is beaten up near Yusil Barrage of Jadugodara 2 may : galudih main baccha chor bataakar ek agyaat vyakti kii buree tarah pitayee May 1: Mohammad Aseem killed near Asanbani pond, beating Saddam Ansari alias Chhotu near Rakha Mines Station on the same day - galudih ke putadu gaanv ke paas sudhir singh kii peet-petakar hatya kar di gai
 Sudhir used to live by begging
 13 may : ghatshila thana kshetra main salmaan miyaan ko peeta gaya May 14: a man was beaten to death at Potka police station in Jamshedpur
 14 may : jaadoogoda main maansik rup se kamazor mahila ko buree tarah peeta gaya May 15: Satyapal Singh beaten by mob in Khukradih of Sunder Nagar 16 may : ghatshila main dimagi taur par kamazor yuvak kii pitayee kii gai 17 May: a brazen mob in Jadugodha, a mentally weak youth is charged with child theft and beaten logon main in hatyaon ke baad gussa dikhne laga he
 The protesters blocked the road near the Jugasalai railway gate and shouted slogans against the administration, stopping the movement of vehicles
 police baar baar kah rahi he ki baccha chori kii ghatana rajya main nahin ho rahi he
 Whoever is spreading the rumor, attempts are being made to catch it
 sawaal he ki kya police ab jaagi he jab chand ghanton ke bheetar 8 logon kii bheed ne hatya kar di
 Saraikala is a Kharsawan district in Jharkhand
 yahaan ke rajnagar main subah subah baccha chori ke andeh main chaar logon ko peet peet kar maar diya gaya
 All were Muslims and were businessmen
 bheed kaa hausala dekhiye ki chaaron kii hatya alag alag jagahon par le jaakar kii gai
 One was killed in Shobhapur, the other was found in Dandu, the third person's body in Sosomali village, while the fourth person's body was found in the forest of Dhobo Dungri
 haldeepokhar nivasee shaikh haleem, mohammad naeem, sajaad or siraaj raat do baje rajnagar kii taraf ja rahe the
 Suddenly his car was tried to stop
 dar kar pados ke gaanv main rishtedaar ke ghar chale gaye
 But the crowd also reached there, directly threatening to hand it over to everyone else or else the whole house would be set on fire
 chaaron ko bheed apane saath le gai or phir hatya kar di
 Where are people coming from so much courage that they take someone out of the house and surround them and kill them wherever they want
 is kaam main ham sirf marane vaale ko dekhte hai, yah nahin dekhte ki is bheed kii raajnneeti main hamaare noujvaan hatyare ho rahe hai
 Anees Khan, senior journalist of Hindustan newspaper, told the information by talking to the people there, it is really dangerous
 baccha chori kii afvaah ko lekar watsap group banaaya gaya, phir yuvakon kii toli banaai gai or baccha chori kii baat failaai jane lagi
 This can be the root of this problem, is there any group who is testing through different rumors whether the mob can surround and kill anyone
 abhi tak ham ise is rup me dekhte rahe hai ki bheed ne musalamaanon ko gher kar maar diya lekin gautam kumaar verma, vikaas kumaar verma or unke dost gangesh kumaar bhi is bheed ke shikaar hue hai
 The incident occurred on the night of 18 May
 bagbeda ke nagadih gaanv main baccha chori ke aarope main jugslai ke gautam kumaar verma, vikaas kumaar verma or uske dost gangesh kumaar kii peet-petakar hatya kar di gai
 Not only this, 65-year-old Ramchandra Devi was beaten badly
 inaki haalat gambhir he
 Gautam and Vikas are real brothers
 unke tasire bhai uttam ko bhi bheed ne pakad liya tha, lekin wo bachakar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 Uttam told that the mob questioned him and suddenly he was attacked saying that he was a child thief
 jharkhand ke saare akhabaaron in khabaron se bhare pade hai
 It is from this that Gautam and Vikas were first tied to electric poles and beaten
 vahaan aasapaas ke gaanv ke log badi sankhya main jamaa hue the
 Surprisingly, such a large number of people are gathering but no one has stopped
 thanedaar sahab saadhe aath baje pahunche, bheed ko samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin ulta police par bhi hamalaa kiya gaya
 The SHO was injured
 aakhir raat 10 baje city espi pahunche, tab jaakar karrwai shuru hui
 By then, Gautam Vikas and Gangesh had been killed
 kuch to he jise ab nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 We must see what pattern this crowd is building, who is creating the crowd
 sirf baccha chori kii afvaah ke zariye nahin, balki tarah tarah ke aarope lagaakar bhi bheed ne kanoon apane haath main liya he or hatya kii he
 Our colleague Harivansh said that such cases are increasing in Jharkhand
 isamen zyadatar sankhya musalamaanon kii bhi he lekin bheed ne duusare samudaay ko bhi nahin choda he
 In Kolhan division which has five districts, 8 people have been killed
 agar puure jharkhand kii baat karen to ab tak afawaah ke naam par 18 logon kii hatya kii gai
 Last month in Bokaro, Shamsuddin was thrashed by a mob and died while undergoing treatment at the hospital
 tippaniyan 2 May 2017: a 60-year-old man was murdered in Dumaria in a similar manner 2 may : jaadoogoda ke eusil bairaj ke paas jon anthony kii pitayee kii gai May 2: An unidentified person badly beaten up as a child thief in Galudih 1 may : asanabani talab ke paas mohammad aseem kii hatya, usee din rakha mins stesan ke paas saddaam ansaari urf chotu kii pitayee Sudhir Singh was beaten to death near Putudu village in Galudih

 pradarshnakariyon ne jugslai railway phatak ke paas sadak ko jam kar diya or vaahanon ke avaagaman ko rokkar prashasan ke khilaaf jamkar narebaazi kii
 Police are repeatedly saying that the incident of child theft is not happening in the state
 jo bhi afvaah failaa rahaa he, use pakadaney kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 The question is whether the police have awakened now when a mob of 8 people was murdered within a few hours
 itani himmat logon main kahaan se aa rahi he ki ve kisi ko ghar se nikaal kar le jate hai or jahaan chaahate hai vahaan gher kar maar dete hai

 Smriti's statement was opposed by Congress leader Anand Sharma and said that he should apologize for the insult to Mother Durga
 iske jawaab main smriti irani ne kaha ki rajyasabha main jo parchaa maine padhaa, wo sarkaar kaa nahin,jeenuca tha
 However, even after this, the opposition remained adamant on apologizing

 aakhir gharelu hinsa he kya? charadivari ke bheetar hone vaali har hinsa gharelu hinsa kii shrenee main aati he
 When the feeling of love, respect and empathy between two people ends and turns into hate and cruelty, it becomes domestic violence
 ye shaareerik, sexual or vyavhaarik teenon hi tarah kii ho sakati he
 In such a situation, it becomes very important to know what are the causes of domestic violence
 aankadon ke aadhaar par dekhen to ghar main pad, paise or duusare bhautik sukhon ke chalate hi zyaadaatar maamle gharelu hinsa kaa rup le lete hai
 Sometimes the feeling of revenge also gives birth to it
 gharelu hinsa ek aparaadh he par baavjood iske isse jude zyaadaatar maamle saamne aa hi nahin pate hai
 Many times people do not allow it to be expressed due to fear of family and family, and fear of losing respect in society
 aise main peedit pratadit hota rahata he or pidaa dene vaala apni barbarta karata rahata he
 According to experts in relation-related matters, in the past few years, such cases have increased significantly
 visheshgy maanate hai ki parteners ke bich aapasi bharose or pyaar ke khatm ho jane se hi chijen is mukaam par pahunch jaati hai
 Effects of Domestic Violence: Before mentioning the effects of domestic violence, it is very important to understand that the family is the unit of society and if there is discord in the family then it will directly affect the society
 zyaadaatar maamalon main mahilaayein hi gharelu hinsa kii shikaar hoti hai lekin aisa nahin he purush varg isse achoota he
 1
 gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar hua shaks kabhi bhi apane dar se baahar nahin aa paata hedgar kisi shaks ne apane jivan main gharelu hinsa jheli he to uske liye is dar se baahar aa paanaa behad mushkil hota he
 After being subjected to constant violence, the negativity in his thinking becomes so dominant that it takes years to stabilize himself
 2
 Mental trauma breaks a person from within
 One of the worst aspects of domestic violence is that its victim is not able to come out of the trauma
 aise maamalon main aksar dekha gaya he ki log yaa to apana maansik santulan kho baithte hai yaa phir avsaad kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 3
 ye ek aisa dard he jisaki dawa shaayad hi kisi ke paas hoise maamle jinamein shaareerik yatnaa bhi shaamil he, peedit ko beintahaa dard sahanaa padataa he
 In many cases, there is also a state of physical inability or an organ stops functioning
 iske saath hi kuch chotein aisi hoti hai jo jaanaleva bhi sabit ho jaati hai
 4
 manorog kii sthiti main pahunch jaataa he peeditgharelu hinsa kaa ye sabase khatarnaak or dukhad pahalu he
 People who we trust so much and live with, when they give such kind of grief, then the person's trust in the relationship gets lost and he makes himself alone
 wo kahin na kahin ye tay kar letaa he ki is duniya main uskaa koi nahin or use apane sahare hi rahanaa hoga
 Many times people also commit suicide in this situation
 aise main ye behad jaruri he ki na to gharelu hinsa ko badhaava den or na hi uske shikaar bane
 Any type of domestic violence is violence and it is necessary to raise voice against it

 aaj ke aam chunaav main shinjo ebe kii kanjarvative ‘libral democratic party’ ko spasht bahumat mil gaya he
 It is believed that the party's top leaders have failed to reduce the anger of the voters

 The party's isolation due to weak leadership and malicious factionalism and mutual differences has tested the patience of voters and they are quite unhappy with the ambiguous response to the incident at the Fukushima nuclear plant
 prasarak ‘enechake’ ne apane chunaav purv surveykshanon ke aadhaar par kaha he ki nichle sadan main aldypi ko kul 480 siton main se 275 se 310 siton par jeet hasil hogi, jabaki sattarudh party dipije ko 55 se 77 siten milengi

 On the other hand, the prices of petrol and diesel continue to fall

 That means air travel can also be cheaper
