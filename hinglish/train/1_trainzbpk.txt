 lok paramparaon main nanda ko rishi himavanth or minavati kii beti mana gaya he, jinka vivaah shiv ke saath hua tha
 Nanda Devi starts from the Nanda Devi temple of Nauti village, located in Karnprayag tehsil of Rajajat Chamoli district
 vahaan se 280 kilometre kii paidal yatra karne ke baad himalay kii oonchi shrunkhalaaon ke bich sthit homekund main puja ke baad waapas nauti aakar sampann hoti he
 The main journey stops at twenty stops, of which the last five stops are in uninhabited areas in the High Himalayan region
 paramparaon ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki hemkund main nanda devi kii sasuraal he
 She comes to her maternal home once in 12 years and then with pomp is sent back to her in-laws
 chaar singon vaala bhed (medhaa) jise chowsing’’-khadu kaha jaataa he, is puri yatra kii aguai karata he
 In the last week of August, when the historic Nanda Devi Rajajat Yatra of Uttarakhand reached Vana village, everyone's eyes were moist
 nanda devi koi dur kii devi nahin thim, har kisi kaa kuch-na-kuch rishta tha unke saath
 An elderly man was crying while leaving his daughter and a woman to his friend
 kisi kii bahan vidaa ho rahi thi to kisi kii buaa
 The trees and plants and rivers were also sad, as if the daughter was going to her in-laws
 bhartiya samaaj main dharmik aayojanon ke aise udhaaharan virale hi hai, jahaan ek ore shradgha or vishwaas se bhari dharmaparayanata ho to duusari ore rishton kii bhaavnaatmak door se bandhe stri-purush, jo devi-devataaon se paariwarik rishta jod baithe hon
 This historic journey started on 18 August from the Nanda Devi temple of Nauti village, located in Karnprayag tehsil of Chamoli district of Uttarakhand
 is yatra ko saanskrithik dharohar maanane vaale uttarakhand ke rajyapal ajij kuraishi us din nauti gaanv main hi maujuud the
 He says, "it is not just religious pilgrimage, it is the cultural heritage of the state
" ise sajaana-sanvarna ham sabhi kaa uttardaayitv he
 "fourteen years later, the entire area from Garhwal to Kumaon in Uttarakhand became bland
" pahari bans se bani rang-birangi chhatauliyaan or devi-devataaon ke nishaan liye yah yatra jab kailash kii ore bad rahi thi to nanda ke jayakaare se pahaad gunj rahe the
 Short journeys from the temples of Nanda at different places to Homkund, located at the foothills of the Nandaaghunghuti mountain, considered to be the in-laws of Nanda, form part of the main journey
 is yatra main shaamil hone waalon main mahilaon kii sankhya sabase zyada thi
 The women, who had come from remote villages, were leading the yatra and bidding farewell to Nanda as per their ability
 ve khaane-pine kaa saamaan, shringaar kii chijen or aabhushanon ke saath vidaai ke geet gaate or rote-rote beti kii vidaai ke is utsav main shariq huin
 Folk litterateur Nandkishore Hatwal calls it a journey more related to religious travel than relationships, saying, "everyone from poor to rich is leaving their daughter on the pretext of this journey
" pahaad kii kathin jindagi main mahilaon kaa sangharsh nanda ke bahaane har mahila mahasoos karti he
 The visit is announced by the head of the Kunwar family of Kansuva village
 nauti se shuru hui yatra pehle ida badhaani gaanv main rukati he
 Then passes through Kansuva to Pindar's area
 nauti se lekar narayanabgad ke bich ke chah padaav nanda ke maayke ke padaav kahe jate hai
 The area beyond Kevar to Phaldiagaon is Nanihal of Nanda and beyond this, Shivbhumi Kailash is called the area of nanda's in-laws
 puri yatra kii aguai kar rahaa chaar singon vaala ek bhed homekund tak jaataa he, jahaan use akelaa chhod diya jaataa he
 It is believed that this sheep is Nanda's companion in the journey ahead
 duniya bhar se patrkaar or documentry film nirmaataa is yatra main shaamil hote hai
 "it was a very different cultural experience for me," says Marfa, a journalist and documentary filmmaker from Poland who joined the trip to Homkund this time
 yun to yah dharmik aayojan hi tha, lekin dharmik rudhipoon yaa kattarta kii chhap kahin nahin thi
 It seemed that there is a large family with a lot of members and the family is going farewell after marriage
 ’’is yatra ke aakhri padaav tak ek lakh se adhik yatri isamen shaamil hue
 Yatra's Vana village had 250 devas and more than 20,000 people by 29 August
 29 agast se tej barish shuru hone ke baavjood logon ne khule aasmaan ke neeche raat guzari
 Former Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal "nishank" and Rajya Sabha MP Tarun Vijay also attended the yatra
 haalanki sarkaar ne umdaa vyavastha kaa daawa kiya tha, lekin barish hone or yatriyon kii sankhya badaae ke saath in daavon kii pole khulti najar ai
 According to the state government, only 2,000 people were allowed to go on the treacherous journey to the high Himalayas, but in fact more than 12,000 people went to Homkund
 is sankhya ko niyantrit karne ke liye hi biomitrix panjikaran kii vyavastha kii gai thi, lekin aakhri samay main vah bhi naakaam rahi
 This time, due to increasing congestion in the yatra, it is expected to have the highest side effects on rare flora and wildlife in Bugali areas of the high Himalayas
 barahawein padaav ke baad yatra van kshetra main sthit gaeroli paatal main pahunchi or terahaven padaav main desh ke sabase sundar bugyalon main ek kahe jane vaale vedni bugyal main
 Here the flora of Bugyal has suffered a lot due to the gathering of ten to twenty thousand people together, which is the dark face of this journey
 bina kisi samuchit sarkari yojana ke yah aitihaasik utsav paryaavaran kii kshati kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 This is the reality revealed by this time Nanda Devi Yatra

 ab bataaiye rajya sarkaar kahati he ki college ko manyata nahin he, lekin usee rajya sarkaar ke mantri is college main padhai ke satr kaa udghaatan bhi kar aate hai
 Overall, the joke that has been made with the students of this poor district is unforgivable
 bharat hi ek aisa desh he jahaan chaatro ko is tarah se barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 His life is being played
 chaatr apane andolan ko lekar bhi sirius hai or college ko lekar bhi hai
 Slogans are being raised about the college that has not started running yet, that the college is mine, this is the pride of India
 jab kagaz par bane college ko institute of eminance kaha ja saktaa he to jo college chalanaa shuru nahin hua he, use bharat kii aan or shaan kyon nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The lives of 431 students are hanging in the balance
 jis college main mantri aakar shubharambh karen, vaais chancelar maujuud rahen or saansad bhi to kisi ko bhi lagegaa ki maamla sarkari ho gaya he or kuch gadabad nahin hoga
 Quaid should have asked the Vice Chancellor whether he knew if it had been recognized when he went to the time of the founding of this college
 shivahar ke ek skool kii imaarat main angeebhoot college shuru karne kaa tamzam shuru hua tha
 We are not really serious about education, only then this kind of gimmick happens
 hamaare sahyogi ne ziladhikari arshad ajeez se baat kii
 He said that after the establishment of the college, students were admitted
 magar shikshakon kii niyukti kii baari ai to jawaab mila ki manzuri nahin mili he
 The District Magistrate hopes to get recognition soon, till then he has written to the same Vice Chancellor of Bihar University who came to Shivhar at the time of its establishment
 likhaa he ki in 431 chaatro ko duusare college main edjust kiya jaae
 Now let's go to Chhattisgarh duniya main na jane kitne marizon ko glucose kaa pani chadhaaya jaataa hoga, kya aapane us jagah par kabhi chitiyon kii bharmaar dekhi he, itani chitiyaan dekhi hai ki wo mariz ke ghaav ko hi jakad len or mar jaae
 Since hospital officials are officers, they can give knowledge and since they are officers, they cannot say why all this happens, more than negligence because there is not enough number of staff to look after the hospitals
 Nor are doctors
 ham samajhate hai ki aapako yah tasviir dekhne main takalif ho rahi hogi ki ek biimaar mariz ke ghaav ko chitiyon ne gher liya he
 This 30 year old patient was not conscious that someone could tell that ants were biting
 na hi astpal ke karmchaariyon kii nazar is baat par gai ki isaki saaf safai kar di jaae
 This patient had a serious injury to his head due to which the primary hospital was evacuated and brought to the district hospital
 vahaan bhi laaparvaahee kaa shikaar ho rahaa tha magar sthaneey vidhayakon ne staff ko fatkaar lagaakar ise zila aspataal bhijwa diya
 He died on Monday after being hospitalized in the district hospital of Baikunthpur for 12 days
 maut kaa kaaran chitiyon kaa kaatna rahaa yaa nahin, ham is par tippanee nahin kar rahe magar bistar par pade mariz ko chuha kaat le, cheentee kaat le, ise notice main lenaa hi chahie ki aam logon ko kis tarah kii chikitsa uplabdh karai ja rahi he
 The officer's answer is as if everything is fine in the hospital, just the ants which come to eat glucose
 saamaajik kaaryakarta kaa jawaab is tarah se he ki kuch ho hi nahin rahaa he
 This district hospital has the capacity to recruit 100 patients but usually gets more than 400 patients
 mangalvaar ko hi 179 mariz bhartee kiye he
 Recently the Ministry of Health, Government of India has drawn a National Health Profile
 isaki site par aap bhi jaakar rajyon main sarkari chikitsa kaa haal dekh sakate hai
 There are 15,916 people in Chhattisgarh with one doctor
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar 25,600 doctor hone chahie
 But the number of sanctioned posts of government doctors is only 1873
 usamen se bhi 410 doctoron ke pad khaali hai
 If you want more than 25000 doctors but there are around 1500 doctors, then you can understand what the condition will be
 chhattisgarh se nikal kar chalate hai ki bihar jahaan ek neshnal haive teen saal se sarkaar kaa rasta dekh rahaa he ki kab sarkaar kii nazar padegi or sadak banegi
 Our colleague Kanhaiya traveled from Saharsa to Murliganj on his bike, riding a bike about 30 km to see why the condition of National Highway is such
 ise neshnal haive 107 kehete hai jo maheshpur se purniya tak jaati he
 Kanhaiya told that earlier it used to take 3 hours to go from Saharsa to Purnia, now it is taking six hours
 aap kanhaiya ke record kiye hue video ke zarie agle chaar minute tak mahasoos kiijie ki vahaan ke log kis tarah se is haive par safar karte honge
 When someone's car overturns, someone's feet fall and break
 hamane sthaneey akhabaaron ko bhi khangala ki is haive ke bare main kya kya chapa he
 Printed in Hindustan on June 24 that construction of NH 107 has not started even eight months after the announcement
 yah neshnal haive madhepura zile kii life line samajha ja rahaa he
 It has not been approved by the Forest Department
 pichley saal 14 oktober ko mokama main pradhanmantri modi ne iske doharikaran kii shuruuaat kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 According to another newspaper, Sasand Pappu Yadav is claiming that all the hurdles have been removed and construction will start soon
 daawey ho rahe hai, prayaas bhi ho rahe honge magar teen saal se log is sadak ke kaaran jo jhel rahe hai, wo aap in tasveeron ke zarie samaj sakate hai
 People say that they are hearing that the tender has been acquired, but the condition of the road has not improved for three years
 9 may ko rajd saansad ne is haive ko lekar kediy parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ko patr bhi likhaa tha
 On 31 May, Nitin Gadkari has sent a written reply to him and he has said that his letter is being sent to the Chief Engineer, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 tippaniyan Recently, the central government has raised the minimum support price of paddy to Rs 1750 per quintal, but the farmers of Cuttack in Odisha are demanding that they be given a price of Rs 5000 per quintal instead of 1750
 aapako yaad hoga ki desh main urisa vidhansabha hi akeli vidhansabha he jahaan par sarvasammati se yah prastaav paas kiya gaya he ki dhan kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 2930 rupee diya jaae
 On 25 March 2017, the motion was passed in the Assembly with the consent of all parties
 jiske baad ise dilli bheja gaya magar kuch nahin hua
 The minimum support price that has just arrived is Rs 1200 less than this offer
 lihaaza is raily main shaamil kisaan wo paisa bhi chaahate hai
 Apart from this, there is a demand of the farmers that those who are only involved in the farming profession should be given farmer security allowance
 36 lakh kisaanon ko saal main ek baar 5000 rupee kaa bhatta mili jis par 21,600 karod kaa kharchaa aayega
 Not only this, there are 12 cold stores in Orissa out of which only three are operating cold storage
 rajya main 250 se 300 cold store banaae jane kii zarurat he
 The farmers do not get the right price in the mandi, so the government should first improve and strengthen the mandi system
 is andolan kaa netritv kisaan netaa akshay kumaar kar rahe the
 Generally, in this kind of struggle of farmers, you will not see any political party leader who keeps sitting in Delhi and tweeting on the issue of farmers
 yogendra yadav ne aarope lagaaya he ki kisaanon ko lekar unke raajnneetik abhiyaan ko rokane liye ab unke parivaar ke sadasyon ko iskar vibhaag ke istal se daraaya ja rahaa he
 Raids are being conducted in Rewari at the home of his sister, brother-in-law and brother and they are unable to contact him
 kisi ko ghar ke bheetar nahin jane diya ja rahaa he
 Both his sisters are doctors
 yogendra ne twit kiya he ki dilli se 100 logon ke dal ne unke aspataal par chaape maare hai
 The hospital and ICU are all sealed
 aam aadmi party ke netaa ashish khetaan ne bhi yogendra ke rishtedaaron ke ghar daale ja rahe chaape ko raajnneetik karrwai bataaya he
 This case is the same way to raid, make stories and create political controversy
 yogendra yadav ke sahyogi prashanth bhushan ne bhi is chaape ko raajnneetik badale kii karrwai bataaya he
 College is my home, it is the force of India, read this slogan on cycle rickshaws, for higher education in towns, villages will be a symbol of growing respect and love for colleges which can compare college with their home and India
 Does it with force
 shivahar zile main nikali is raily main ve chaatr shaamil hai
 Last year, 431 students took admission for BA in this Angiabhutta college in Shivhar
 10 agast 2017 ko bihar vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati kii maujuudagi main is college kii sthapana hui thi
 This is the same university where there was not a single examination in the year of 2017
 jo bhi he, angeebhoot mahavidhyalay shivahar main shaikshanik satr kii shuruuaat ke liye bihar ke sahakaarita mantri rana randhir singh or bijepi saansad rama devi maujuud thim
 Admission is done and advertisement for this year's admission has also come out
 ab achaanak khabar ai he ki is college ko manyata hi nahin mili he
 Till there is no recognition, we will not study here
 bina manyata ke hi saansad or mantri yahaan feeta kaat gaye lekin jab ziladhikari ne vishvavidlaay ko patr likhaa ki padhaane ke liye shikshak diya jaae to pole khul gai ki rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki is college ko manyata hi nahin mili he, padhai band karen
 Now tell that the state government says that the college is not recognized, but the ministers of the same state government also inaugurate the session of studies in this college
 kulamilaakar is garib zile ke chaatro ke saath jo mazaaq hua he wo akshamya he
 India is one such country where students are being ruined in this way
 unki zindagi se khelaa ja rahaa he
 Students are serious about their movement and also about the college
 jo college abhi chalanaa shuru nahin hua he uske bare main naare laga rahe hai ki college meri aan he, yah bharat kii shaan he
 When a college on paper can be called the Institute of Eminence, then the college which has not started running, why cannot it be called Aan and Shaan of India
 431 chaatro kii zindagi adhar main latak gai he
 The Vice Chancellor should be present in the college where the minister should come and inaugurate and even the MP will feel that the matter has become official and nothing will go wrong
 kaayade se vaais chancelar se poocha janaa chahie ki jab ve is college kii sthapana ke samay ke liye gaye the to kya unhen pataa tha ki ise manyata mili he yaa nahin
 The frills of starting Angibhit College started in a school building in Shivhar
 shiksha ko lekar ham vaaki gambhir nahin he tabhi is tarah kii nautanki ho jaati he
 Our colleague spoke to District Collector Arshad Aziz
 unhone kaha ki college kii sthapana ke baad chaatro kaa admician hua
 But when it came to appoint teachers, the answer was that the approval has not been received
 ziladhikari ko ummid he ki jaldi hi manyata mil jaaegi tab tak unhone bihar vishwavidwalay ke unheen kulapati ko likhaa he jo isaki sthapana ke samay shivahar aae the
 It is written that these 431 students should be adjusted in another college
 ab chalate hai chhattisgarh
 Not knowing how many patients in the world would have been given glucose water, have you ever seen a lot of ants at that place, have seen so many ants that they will hold the patient's wound and die
 aspataal ke adhikari chunki adhikari hai isile wo gyaan de sakate hai or chunki ve adhikari hai isliye nahin bol sakate hai ki ye sab kyon ho jaataa he, laaparvaahee se zyada isliye bhi ho jaataa he kyonki aspataalon main dekharekh ke liye paryaapt sankhya main karmchaaree nahin hai or na hi doctor hai
 We understand that you may have trouble seeing this picture that ants have surrounded the wound of a sick patient
 30 saal kaa yah mariz hosh main nahin tha ki kisi ko kah sake ki chitiyaan kaat rahi hai
 Nor did the staff of Astpal look at the fact that it should be cleaned up
 is mariz ke sar main gambhir chot ai thi jiske kaaran praathmik aspataal se nikaalkar zila aspataal laayaa gaya tha
 There too was a victim of negligence, but the local legislators reprimanded the staff and sent it to the district hospital
 12 dinon tak baikunthpur ke zila aspataal main bhartee rahane ke baad somvaar ko isaki maut ho gai
 We are not commenting on whether the ants bite due to death, but the patient lying on the bed should bite the rat, bite the ant, it must be taken into notice what kind of treatment is being provided to the common people
 
 adhikari kaa jawaab is tarah se he jaise aspataal main sab thik he, bas chiti lag gai jo glucose khaane aa jaati he
 The social worker's answer is in such a way that nothing is happening
 is zila aspataal main 100 marizon ko bhartee karne kii kshamta he lekin aam taur par 400 se adhik mariz aa jate hai
 Only 179 patients have been admitted on Tuesday
 haal hi main bharat sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay ne ek neshnal health profile nikaali he
 You can also visit its site and see the condition of government medicine in the states
 chhattisgarh main 15,916 logon par ek doctor he
 According to the World Health Organization, there should be 25,600 doctors
 magar sarkari doctoron ke manzur padon kii sankhya maatr 1873 hi he
 Out of that, 410 doctors posts are vacant
 25000 se adhik doctor chahie magar 1500 ke kareeb doctor hai to aap samaj sakate hai ki kya haalat hogi
 Walking out of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, where a national highway has been watching the path of the government for three years, when the government will look and the road will be built
 hamaare sahyogi kanhaiya ne saharsa se muraliganj tak apni bike se yatra, kareeb 30 kimi bike chalaakar dekha ki neshnal haive kii aisi haalat kyon hai
 It is called National Highway 107 which runs from Maheshpur to Purnia
 kanhaiya ne bataaya ki pehle saharsa se purniya tak jane main 3 ghante lagate the, ab chah ghante lag rahe hai
 Through the recorded video of Kanhaiya, feel for the next four minutes how the people there will be traveling on this highway
 kisi kii gaadi ulat jaati he to gir kar kisi ke paanv tut jate hai
 We also looked at the local newspapers as to what was printed about this highway
 24 june ke hindustan main chapa he ki ghoshnaa ke aath maah baad bhi enech 107 kaa nirmaan kaary shuru nahin hua he
 This National Highway is considered to be the lifeline of Madhepura district
 van vibhaag se isaki manzuri nahin mili he
 On 14 October last year, Prime Minister Modi announced the commencement of its doubling in Mokama
 ek or akhbaar ke anusaar saasand pappu yadav daawa kar rahe hai ki sari adchane dur ho gai hai or jaldi nirmaan shuru hoga
 Claims are being made, efforts will also be made, but through these pictures you can understand what people are facing due to this road for three years
 log kehete hai ki ve sun hi rahe hai ki tender ho gaya, to adhigrahan ho gaya magar sadak kii haalat main teen saal se sudhaar nahin he
 On 9 May, the RJD MP also wrote a letter to the Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari regarding this highway
 31 may ko nitin gadakari ne unhen likhit jawaab bheja he or usamen itnaa hi kaha he ki aapke patr ko mukhya abhiyantaa sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay ko bheja ja rahaa he

 After which it was sent to Delhi but nothing happened
 abhi jo nunatam samarthan mulya aayaa he wo is prastaav se 1200 rupaya kam he
 So the farmers involved in this rally also want that money
 iske alaava kisaanon kii ek maang he ki jo sirf kheti ke peshey se jude hai unhen kisaan suraksha bhatta diya jaae
 36 lakh farmers will get an allowance of Rs 5000 once a year, on which an expenditure of 21,600 crores will be incurred
 yahi nahin urisa main 12 cold store hai jisamen se teen hi cold storage kaam kar rahe hai
 There is a need to set up 250 to 300 cold stores in the state
 kisaanon ko mandi main sahi daam nahin milte hai isliye sarkaar ko pehle mandi system main sudhaar karnaa chahie or majboot karnaa chahie
 This movement was led by farmer leader Akshay Kumar

 tippaniyan Recently, the central government has raised the minimum support price of paddy to Rs 1750 per quintal, but the farmers of Cuttack in Odisha are demanding that they be given a price of Rs 5000 per quintal instead of 1750
 aapako yaad hoga ki desh main urisa vidhansabha hi akeli vidhansabha he jahaan par sarvasammati se yah prastaav paas kiya gaya he ki dhan kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 2930 rupee diya jaae
 On 25 March 2017, the motion was passed in the Assembly with the consent of all parties

 The minimum support price that has just arrived is Rs 1200 less than this offer

 36 lakh kisaanon ko saal main ek baar 5000 rupee kaa bhatta mili jis par 21,600 karod kaa kharchaa aayega
 Not only this, there are 12 cold stores in Orissa out of which only three are operating cold storage
 rajya main 250 se 300 cold store banaae jane kii zarurat he
 The farmers do not get the right price in the mandi, so the government should first improve and strengthen the mandi system

 Generally, in this kind of struggle of farmers, you will not see any political party leader who keeps sitting in Delhi and tweeting on the issue of farmers
 yogendra yadav ne aarope lagaaya he ki kisaanon ko lekar unke raajnneetik abhiyaan ko rokane liye ab unke parivaar ke sadasyon ko iskar vibhaag ke istal se daraaya ja rahaa he

 Now let's go to Chhattisgarh duniya main na jane kitne marizon ko glucose kaa pani chadhaaya jaataa hoga, kya aapane us jagah par kabhi chitiyon kii bharmaar dekhi he, itani chitiyaan dekhi hai ki wo mariz ke ghaav ko hi jakad len or mar jaae
 Since hospital officials are officers, they can give knowledge and since they are officers, they cannot say why all this happens, more than negligence because there is not enough number of staff to look after the hospitals
 Nor are doctors
 ham samajhate hai ki aapako yah tasviir dekhne main takalif ho rahi hogi ki ek biimaar mariz ke ghaav ko chitiyon ne gher liya he
 This 30 year old patient was not conscious that someone could tell that ants were biting
 na hi astpal ke karmchaariyon kii nazar is baat par gai ki isaki saaf safai kar di jaae
 This patient had a serious injury to his head due to which the primary hospital was evacuated and brought to the district hospital
 vahaan bhi laaparvaahee kaa shikaar ho rahaa tha magar sthaneey vidhayakon ne staff ko fatkaar lagaakar ise zila aspataal bhijwa diya
 He died on Monday after being hospitalized in the district hospital of Baikunthpur for 12 days
 maut kaa kaaran chitiyon kaa kaatna rahaa yaa nahin, ham is par tippanee nahin kar rahe magar bistar par pade mariz ko chuha kaat le, cheentee kaat le, ise notice main lenaa hi chahie ki aam logon ko kis tarah kii chikitsa uplabdh karai ja rahi he
 The officer's answer is as if everything is fine in the hospital, just the ants which come to eat glucose
 saamaajik kaaryakarta kaa jawaab is tarah se he ki kuch ho hi nahin rahaa he
 This district hospital has a capacity to admit 100 patients but usually gets more than 400 patients
 mangalvaar ko hi 179 mariz bhartee kiye he
 Recently the Ministry of Health, Government of India has drawn a National Health Profile
 isaki site par aap bhi jaakar rajyon main sarkari chikitsa kaa haal dekh sakate hai
 There are 15,916 people in Chhattisgarh with one doctor
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar 25,600 doctor hone chahie
 But the number of sanctioned posts of government doctors is only 1873
 usamen se bhi 410 doctoron ke pad khaali hai
 If you want more than 25000 doctors but there are around 1500 doctors, then you can understand what the condition will be
 chhattisgarh se nikal kar chalate hai ki bihar jahaan ek neshnal haive teen saal se sarkaar kaa rasta dekh rahaa he ki kab sarkaar kii nazar padegi or sadak banegi
 Our colleague Kanhaiya traveled from Saharsa to Murliganj on his bike, riding a bike about 30 km to see why the condition of National Highway is such
 ise neshnal haive 107 kehete hai jo maheshpur se purniya tak jaati he
 Kanhaiya told that earlier it used to take 3 hours to go from Saharsa to Purnia, now it is taking six hours
 aap kanhaiya ke record kiye hue video ke zarie agle chaar minute tak mahasoos kiijie ki vahaan ke log kis tarah se is haive par safar karte honge

 We understand that you may have trouble seeing this picture that ants have surrounded the wound of a sick patient
 30 saal kaa yah mariz hosh main nahin tha ki kisi ko kah sake ki chitiyaan kaat rahi hai
 Nor did the staff of Astpal look at the fact that it should be cleaned up
 is mariz ke sar main gambhir chot ai thi jiske kaaran praathmik aspataal se nikaalkar zila aspataal laayaa gaya tha
 There too was a victim of negligence, but the local legislators reprimanded the staff and sent it to the district hospital
 12 dinon tak baikunthpur ke zila aspataal main bhartee rahane ke baad somvaar ko isaki maut ho gai
 We are not commenting on whether the ants bite due to death, but the patient lying on the bed should bite the rat, bite the ant, it must be taken into notice what kind of treatment is being provided to the common people
 
 adhikari kaa jawaab is tarah se he jaise aspataal main sab thik he, bas chiti lag gai jo glucose khaane aa jaati he
 The social worker's answer is in such a way that nothing is happening
 is zila aspataal main 100 marizon ko bhartee karne kii kshamta he lekin aam taur par 400 se adhik mariz aa jate hai
 Only 179 patients have been admitted on Tuesday
 haal hi main bharat sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay ne ek neshnal health profile nikaali he
 You can also visit its site and see the condition of government medicine in the states
 chhattisgarh main 15,916 logon par ek doctor he
 According to the World Health Organization, there should be 25,600 doctors
 magar sarkari doctoron ke manzur padon kii sankhya maatr 1873 hi he
 Out of that, 410 doctors posts are vacant
 25000 se adhik doctor chahie magar 1500 ke kareeb doctor hai to aap samaj sakate hai ki kya haalat hogi
 Walking out of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, where a national highway has been watching the path of the government for three years, when the government will look and the road will be built
 hamaare sahyogi kanhaiya ne saharsa se muraliganj tak apni bike se yatra, kareeb 30 kimi bike chalaakar dekha ki neshnal haive kii aisi haalat kyon hai
 It is called National Highway 107 which runs from Maheshpur to Purnia
 kanhaiya ne bataaya ki pehle saharsa se purniya tak jane main 3 ghante lagate the, ab chah ghante lag rahe hai
 Through the recorded video of Kanhaiya, feel for the next four minutes how the people there will be traveling on this highway
 kisi kii gaadi ulat jaati he to gir kar kisi ke paanv tut jate hai
 We also looked at the local newspapers as to what was printed about this highway
 24 june ke hindustan main chapa he ki ghoshnaa ke aath maah baad bhi enech 107 kaa nirmaan kaary shuru nahin hua he
 This National Highway is considered to be the lifeline of Madhepura district
 van vibhaag se isaki manzuri nahin mili he
 On 14 October last year, Prime Minister Modi announced the commencement of its doubling in Mokama
 ek or akhbaar ke anusaar saasand pappu yadav daawa kar rahe hai ki sari adchane dur ho gai hai or jaldi nirmaan shuru hoga
 Claims are being made, efforts will also be made, but through these pictures you can understand what people are facing due to this road for three years
 log kehete hai ki ve sun hi rahe hai ki tender ho gaya, to adhigrahan ho gaya magar sadak kii haalat main teen saal se sudhaar nahin he
 On 9 May, the RJD MP also wrote a letter to the Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari regarding this highway
 31 may ko nitin gadakari ne unhen likhit jawaab bheja he or usamen itnaa hi kaha he ki aapke patr ko mukhya abhiyantaa sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay ko bheja ja rahaa he

 You will remember that Orissa Legislative Assembly is the only Legislative Assembly in the country where it has been unanimously passed that the minimum support price of paddy be given at Rs 2930
 25 march 2017 ko vidhansabha main yah prastaav sabhi dalon kii sahmati se paas hua tha
 After which it was sent to Delhi but nothing happened
 abhi jo nunatam samarthan mulya aayaa he wo is prastaav se 1200 rupaya kam he
 So the farmers involved in this rally also want that money
 iske alaava kisaanon kii ek maang he ki jo sirf kheti ke peshey se jude hai unhen kisaan suraksha bhatta diya jaae
 36 lakh farmers will get an allowance of Rs 5000 once a year, on which an expenditure of 21,600 crores will be incurred
 yahi nahin urisa main 12 cold store hai jisamen se teen hi cold storage kaam kar rahe hai
 There is a need to set up 250 to 300 cold stores in the state
 kisaanon ko mandi main sahi daam nahin milte hai isliye sarkaar ko pehle mandi system main sudhaar karnaa chahie or majboot karnaa chahie
 This movement was led by farmer leader Akshay Kumar

 Yogendra Yadav has alleged that his family members are now being intimidated from the Istal of the Income Tax Department to stop his political campaign against farmers

 The manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to take strict measures against terrorism during the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the countrymen felt that terrorist events in the country would be curbed as soon as Modi becomes PM
 khaskar jammu evam kashmir main pakistan seemapar se aatankwaad failaane kii himakat tak nahin kar sakegaa
 The lives of our soldiers dying daily on the border will be protected
 aaj jab modi sarkaar ko chaar saal puure hone ko hai to na to aatankwaad or na hi kashmir ke mudde par tasviir main kuch bada badlaav najar aa rahaa he
 It is also not that during the four years of Narendra Modi's tenure on the issue of terrorism, our forces have been sitting hand in hand
 bhartiya senaaon ne jamkar aatankwaad kaa muqabla kiya, khaskar jammu evam kashmir main
 But the biggest question arises here at what cost
 aankade bataate hai ki narendra modi ke in 4 varshon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kai aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya gaya, lekin ye bhi sachai he ki seemaa par tainaat hamaare javaanon ko zyada shahadat deni padi he
 During the Lok Sabha election 2014 campaign, Narendra Modi had targeted the then Congress government, saying that on one hand Pakistan is carrying out terrorist attacks in India and on the other hand the Congress government is engaged in sending love letters to Pakistan
 narendra modi ne yahaan tak kaha tha ki pakistan jis bhashaa main samajhe use us bhashaa main jawaab dena chahie
 Also, Narendra Modi said that when the country's borders, the country's forces, the CRPF force, all the security forces, the satellite, the mobile network, the banking network are all under the control of the central government, then who is stopping it to control the terrorists? 
 lekin centre sarkaar or PM kii gaddi sanbhaalane ke baad narendra modi aatankwaad par lagaam laga paae hon, aisa najar nahin aata
 On the contrary, Pakistan has increased the attack on us and the phase of instability in Jammu and Kashmir is in the form of horrors
 aatank ke safaaye main manmohan se kamjor rahe modijammu evam kashmir main aae din aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf chal rahe abhiyaan ke baavjood aankade bataate hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya karne ke maamle main apane purvavarti pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii apeksha dhime hai
 South Asia Terrorism Portal (satp
 org) ke mutabik, manmohan singh ke UPA-2 kii sarkaar ke aakhri ke chaar varshon yani 2010 se 2013 ke dauraan kul 2022 aatankwaadi maar giraae gaye the, jabaki narendra modi ke chaar varshon ke kaarykaal main 1737 aatankwaadiyon ko dher kiya ja sakaa he
 Thus, during the last four years of UPA-2, 505 terrorists were killed per year, while during the four years of the Modi government, the rate of terror cleansing was close to 434 per year
 modi sarkaar main kashmir main sainikon kii shahadat badhinarendra modi PM kii gaddi par baithte hi pakistan se lagi simaaen sil kar dene kaa daawa kar rahe the, jabaki ho rahaa he uske thik ulat
 Compared to the last four years of UPA-2, more soldiers have been killed in terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in the Modi government
 manmohan singh ke kaarykaal ke aakhri chaar varshon (2010-2013) ke dauraan J&K main aatankwaadi hamalon main kul 177 sainik shahid hue the, jabaki modi raaj main jammu evam kashmir main kul 263 sainikon ko apni shahadat deni padi
 However, during this period, there has been a slight increase in the number of terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan ye bhi ullekhneey he ki deshbhar main vibhinn aatankwaadi hamalon main marane vaale sainikon kii sankhya main jarur kami ai he, jisamen north east or madhya bharat main naksali hamalon par rokthaam kaa yogadan rahaa he
 PAK intensified ceasefire violations After becoming Prime Minister, the harsh language that Narendra Modi and his ministers have been using against Pakistan, it seemed that Pakistan would stop supporting terrorists and the cross-border firing would reduce

 aankadon kii baat karen to saal 2017 main 860, saal 2016 main 271 or 2015 main 387 baar pakistan ne sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 There were 405 ceasefire violations in 2014, 347 in 2013, 114 in 2012, 62 in 2011 and 62 in 2010

 The Shiv Sena has slammed Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for using terminology like 'suit-boot ki sarkar' against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mukhpatr 'saamana' ke somvaar ank main shivasena ne likhaa he ki suutakes kii tulana main suut-boot kii sarkaar acchhee he or paridhaan samasya he to rahul gandhi langot main ganth baandhakar india get ke saamne aaen or adarsh nirmaan karen
 In its familiar style, the party has written in the mouthpiece that if 100 Rahul Gandhi also comes in front of Modi, then he will not be able to stand
 'phir langot main ghumen kya?' sheershak ke saath likhe gaye sampadakeey main shivasena ne likhaa he, '56 din kii rahasyamai chuttee ke baad rahul gandhi ke vyavhaar-bolne main jo parivartan dikhaai de rahaa he vah ullekhneey he
 Rahul Gandhi is shaking, shaking and speaking, due to which the waterfall of Chaitanya has started flowing in the Congress party
 lekin modi kii mahalahar ke saamne yah jharnaa tikega kya, yah sawaal he
 'the suit-boot is better than the suitcase', referring to the reply given to Rahul by the Prime Minister in the editorial, it is written that the suit-boot government is better than the government of the suitcase
 piem aisi tippanee ke karte hi congress or unke bagalabacchon ne jin suutakeson ko chhupaakar rakhaa hoga ve bhi tharra uthi hongi
 Money politics is suitcase politics
 is tarah labalab bhare hue suutakes idhar se udhar dilli main ghumaae jate the, yah alam puri duniya ko pataa he
 Congress's suitcases are filled with notes to 'see' them, which is their tradition
 ghotaalon kaa zikrasamna main congress raaj ke ghotaalon kaa zikr karte hue likhaa gaya he ki 100 rahul bhi aa jaaen to bhi modi ke topakhane ke saamne ve nahin tik paaenge
 Praising the Modi government, the party has written that the shocking decisions that Modi has taken all over the world and have increased the pride of the country all over the world and because of this the Congress people have stopped speaking
 congress netaa ahamed patel par nishaanaa sadhate hue sampadakeey main likhaa he, 'modi ke aisa kehete hi ki bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak mere liye pratishtha yaa jeene-marane kaa sawaal nahin he, ahamed patel ke kanth se swar phuta
 Since when did Ahmed Patel worry about the prestige and living of farmers? The worst plight of the peasants was in the 'suitcase' regime and who was the emperor of that kingdom? 'shiv Sena further wrote,' If the Congressmen feel that the industrialists of the country, the people of the corporate sector, abandon the suit-boots and move around in kafni and diapers First of all, Rahul Gandhi, Ahmed Patel and Manmohan et cetera, come in front of India Gate by lumping the loincloth from tomorrow and construct the model
 arthath rahul kya or unke sur main sur milaanevaale unke chele kya?'party ne likhaa ki suut-boot ek vaishvik poshaak he
 Reputation in clumsy costumes does not increase prestige in the world
 modi ke kaarykaal main desh ko ek nai chamak praapt hui he
 It is our firm view that Hindusthan's suit-booted men are walking with confidence on the global stage and are benefiting for the country's economic progress

 isi bich asaram apane vaahan main baithkar vahaan se chale gaye

 Through the release, the ministry clarified that no provision has been made in the amendment of the tax rules recently passed by the Lok Sabha, according to which, according to the rules, the gold purchased will be the victim of a surgical strike
 yah sanshodhan ab rajyasabha main paarit hone kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 It was further written in the release of the ministry that it is rumored to impose 75% tax on legal jewelery and ancestral jewelery kept in the house and 10% of the tax amount
 haalanki usamen yah bhi bataaya ki tex niyamon main sanshodhan prastaav main usneinakam tex niyamke us bhaag main badlaav kiye hai jahaan sampatti main aghoshit nivesh main abhi tak mahaj 30 fisadi kii dar se tex vasula jaataa tha

 If jewelery is found to be present, accounts will be done
 vahiin yadi baraamad hui sabhi jewelery kii raseed maujuud he athwa vah kanuunan kharidi gai he to vah puri tarah se surakshit he

 But this cleanliness, which has been asked without any doubt, has created confusion in the country

 It is natural to fear that the government talking about surgical tax should not make it a new limit of gold and silver kept at home

 The country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has also informed through its website that its ongoing press releases are being misread and understood

 desh main sabhi tabake ke log rosemara ke kharch ke alaava kisi immergency ke liye is karency ko thik-thaak maatra main apane ghar main rakhte the
 However, it is also true that being the biggest note, it was also the most preferred currency for keeping black money in the form of cash
 notebandi kaa yah faisla desh main kisi bhuuchaal se kam nahin tha
 Those who had hard earned money in these currencies should be in the queue of the bank so that it can be quickly converted into a new currency

 unke bayanon main spasht rup se kaha gaya ki kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye itnaa bada kadam sirf or sirf modi sarkaar uthaa sakati he
 The ruling party and the Prime Minister themselves have even claimed that this step is not being liked by the opposition sitting on black money
 iske saath hi satta main baithe kuch mantriyon ne yahaan tak samaa baandh diya ki yah to kaledhan ke khilaaf mahaj shuruyaat he
 In the gestures, it was claimed that after demonetisation, the big surgical strike of Modi government will be done against gold and benami property in the country
 aisi sthiti main yah tay he ki desh main vaaki afra-tafari kaa maahaul vyapak ho chukaa he
 The changing rules of the government and the Reserve Bank above are making this situation more frightening

 Addressing the National Conference of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Mahila Morcha, Modi said, "despite all odds and resistance from the hardliners and the opposition, the government is committed to enacting a law against triple talaq so that Muslim women can get into their social lives Get rid of big insecurity "

 The law of the Hanafi sect of Islam recognizes triple talaq as valid

 Continuing his satire, Jaitley, who was fiercely contesting Congress' Amarinder Singh from Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, said, "many people are willing to sell property for 'insufficient reasons', collect land and property with the patronage of the government
" kuch sampatti ko bech kar mul rin ko chukaa dijie

 The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, along with targeting Vadra, also pulled up the PMO in defense of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his article
 unhone kaha ki khamoshi akhriyaar rakhane vaale pradhanmantri ke bare main pradhanmantri karyaalay ne daawa kiya he ki pichley 10 saal main 1200 bhaashan dekar vah ausatan har teen din main ek baar bole hai
 Jaitley said, 'the PMO feels that this logic of Dr
 manmohan singh par lage is aarope par viraam lag jayega ki vah ‘khamosh pradhanmantri’ hai
 He said, 'but being the principal political executive of the country, the Prime Minister is the face of Indian democracy
 uske vichaar desh kii niti ko shakl dete hai
 He provides leadership
 janata uski ore samaadhaan ke liye dekhati he
 The BJP leader said, 'A prime minister cannot be of less importance
 use janata kaa vishwaas jagaane vaala hona chahie
 He should look confident in presenting the solution
 use sattarudh gathbandhan kaa sheersh jan netaa hona chahie
 He should have both moral and political power
 ’ unhone kaha, 'aankadon ke hisaab se piemo sahi he ki pradhanmantri das saalon main ausatan har tisare din bole hai lekin ‘vaastaviktaa main unhen suna nahin gaya

 ' Congress party leader in North MCD, Mukesh Goyal has alleged that MCD councilors are not being provided funds for development works in their wards
 goyal ne aarope lagaaya ki fund naa milane se vaardon main vikaas kaary thap pade hai
 There is a difference in the statement and actions of the ruling BJP leaders in the MCD
 netaa janata kii vaahvahee luutane ke liye badi-badi ghoshnaaen to kar dete hai lekin unhen amalijama pehanaane ke liye koi prayaas nahin karte
 This is the reason why MCD is facing financial crisis today
 unhone kaha ki fund na hone ke kaaran emsidi apane staff ko samay par selary de paane main naakaam he to vahiin vaardon main koi vikaas kaary nahin ho rahe hai
 Goyal said that it has also become difficult to carry out repair and maintenance work in the ward
 yahaan tak kiamsidistoron main marammat saamagree or anya saamaan uplabdh nahin hai, jisase janata ke gusse kaa saamana parshadon ko karnaa pad rahaa he
 Goyal lashed out at the BJP, saying that at the time of the MCD elections, BJP leaders had promised the people of Delhi that they would improve the financial condition of the MCD in two months if voted to power
 lekin sava saal bitne ke baad emsidi kii vittiya sthiti sudharne kii bajaay or kharaab ho gai he
 He said that in the budget of 2018-2019, MCD BJP leaders have made a provision of giving 50 million rupees to each councilor for carrying out development work in their wards
 lekin is fund kaa abhi tak kuch pataa nahin he
 According to Goyal, the councilors, who are troubled by the lack of development, repair and maintenance work in the wards, have told many times their problems in the House meeting, Standing Committee and other committees meetings, but BJP leaders and Commissioners including the Mayor have no solution to this
 Are removing mukesh goyalane kaha ki ab jab dilli me monsoon aa chukaa he to isse dilli ke halaat or bighad sakate he kyonki naalon kii safai nahin hui he
 Due to the lack of funds, the condition of the parks is bad, there is no light burning, the boundary wall, the grill is broken, the grass is enlarged and in such condition dengue, malaria and chikungunya can spread

 On Thursday, the third Test match between India and Australia will begin in Ranchi
 ek ore viraat kohli ke aguwai main bhartiya team bangaleru test ke jeet ke safar ko aage doharaana chaahegi, to vahiin steve smith kii captaini main australian team bhi vaapasi kii raah dekh rahi hogi
 At the same time, both teams would like to try the passion on the ground forgetting the DRS controversy of Bangalore Test
 donon tiimon ne abhi tak 1-1 match jeeta he, donon tiimon kii nigahen ab siries main badhat banane par hogi
 The time of forgetting the DRS fight had created a lot of controversy over the DRS controversy that arose in the Bengaluru Test, the matter had reached the ICC
 bisisiai or cricket australia is mudde par pehle aamane-saamne the lekin baad main donon ne is maamle ko sulajhaa liya tha
 But now both teams would like to forget the matter and move forward and focus on the game
 mangalvaar ko ek kaarykram main purv bhartiya captainsorav ganguliur purv australian captain maaikel clark ne bhi kaha tha ki tiimon ko is mudde ko bhuulaa aage badhanaa chahie
 Opportunity to lead In this Test series of four matches, both teams are still at par, Australia defeated India by a big margin in the Pune Test, and in Bangalore, the Indian team returned to the series showing a great game
 yahaan ranchi main donon hi tiimon kii nigaah aakraamak rukh apana kar badhat banane kii hogi
 Spin will remain Like the Havipune and Bangalore Tests, the spinners will dominate the Ranchi Test as well
 pune test main jahaan australia ke okif jeet ke hero bane the to pune test main bharat kii ore se aar
 Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja hit back
 ranchi kii pich bhi spinner friendli bataai ja rahi he, bharat or australia chahenge ki vah apane spinneron ke jariye virdohi team par hamalavar ho saken
 Without 'prince of Ranchi', the team will go to play a test match , the chance to create a world record is a chance to make a world record in front of India
 abhi tak bharat ne is sijan main gharelu maidan par kul 9 match jite hai, vahiin isse pehle ek sijan main gharelu maidan par 11 test jeeton kaa record he
 India can match this record if they win both the upcoming Test matches
 kohli se ummeedbhartiya captain viraat kohliis siries main abhi tak lagbhag fail hi rahe hai
 In two Tests, Kohli has scored only 40 runs so far
 pune test main jahaan kohli maatr 0 or 13 ran hi bana paae, to vahiin bangaleru test main bhi viraat 12 or 15 ran par hi nipat gaye
 Team India would like their captain to go ahead and take the team forward

 mahendra singh dhoni ko tii-20 vishwa cap tak bharat kaa captain barkaraar rakhane ke baad mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne kaha ki board atakalon par viraam lagaakar khilaadiyon ko bataanaa chahta tha ki march-april main hone vaale toornament main unka captain koun hoga
 Patil said this after the selection of Indian ODI and T20 teams on the tour of Australia
 unhone kaha, hamane mahendra singh dhoni ko captain chunaa he, kyonki ham media main chal rahi atakalbaaji par viraam lagaana chaahate hai
 Not only the media, but the players should also know who will be their captain
 unhone kaha, khilaadiyon kaa chayan captain se mashvire ke baad kiya gaya or ham unke saath hai
 The comments dhoni ke bhavishya ke bare main board sachiv anuraag thakur ne kaha, bisisiai khilaadiyon ke bhavishya par charchaa nahin karata
 This is the job of the selectors
 dhoni bharat ke sabase safal captain hai or do vishwa cap jeet chuke hai tathaa bharat ko number van test ranking tak le gaye hai
 He said, we have chosen Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the captain, because we want to stop the speculation going on in the media
 sirf media hi nahin, balki khilaadiyon ko bhi pataa hona chahie ki unka captain koun hoga
 "the players were selected after consultations with the captain and we are with him," he said
 tippaniyan Regarding Dhoni's future, Board Secretary Anurag Thakur said, BCCI does not discuss the future of players
 yah chayankartaaon kaa kaam he
 Dhoni is India's most successful captain and has won two World Cups and led India to the number one Test rankings
 dhoni ke bhavishya ke bare main board sachiv anuraag thakur ne kaha, bisisiai khilaadiyon ke bhavishya par charchaa nahin karata
 This is the job of the selectors
 dhoni bharat ke sabase safal captain hai or do vishwa cap jeet chuke hai tathaa bharat ko number van test ranking tak le gaye hai
 Sakshi, daughter of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, married Ajitesh Kumar, who comes from the Dalit community, of her choice
 ghar se bhagkar shaadi karne ke baad se sakshi or unke pati ajitesh kumaar apni jaan kaa khatra bataa rahe hai
 He told Aaj Tak that he is being chased and is in danger of his life
 jab sakshi ne apni suraksha ke liye bareli ke police adheekshak se guhaar lagaai, to unhone court ke aadesh ke bina suraksha muhaiyaa karaane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Before the conversation with Aaj Tak, Sakshi and her husband Ajitesh Kumar also released a video and described their life as a threat
 is ghatana ke saamne aane ke baad se sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya desh ko aazaadee milane ke itane saalon baad bhi ek balig ladki or ladke ko apni marji se shaadi karne kaa adhikaar he yaa nahin
 In this regard, Jitendra Mohan Sharma, vice-president and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court Bar Association, says that every girl who has attained the age of 18 years and every boy who has attained the age of 21 years, has the fundamental right to marry on their own
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat supreme court apane faisle main kai dfa kah chukaa he ki shaadi karne kaa adhikaar bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 main mili jivan ke adhikaar ke tahat aata he
 No one can take away this right
 unka kahana he ki agar ladki ne 18 saal or ladke ne 21 saal kii umr puri kar lee he, to wo shaadi kar sakate hai
 Things like caste, religion, region and language do not become an obstacle in their marriage
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki jo ladki 18 saal kii umr puri kar chuki he, wo kisi bhi jati, dharm or yahaan tak ki videshi se shaadi kar sakati he
 The same applies to boys
 supreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma ne kaha ki agar ladke kii umr 21 saal ho chuki he, to vah kisi bhi jati, dharm yaa kisi duusare desh ke naagarik se shaadi kar saktaa he
 If someone creates or prevents a hurdle in their marriage, they can go directly to the High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution and directly to the Supreme Court under Article 32
 agar navadanpati ko apane parijanon se jaan-maal kaa khatra he, to wo supreme court or hoicourt se suraksha kii maang bhi kar sakate hai
 Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, said that no boy or girl needs any permission to marry
 shaadi ke liye shart sirf itani he ki ladkaa yaa ladki kii dimagi sthiti thik honi chahie, taaki wo shaadi ke liye apni sahmati de saken
 Let us tell you that many acts have been made for marriage, including Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, Indian Christian Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act
 inke tahat shaadi ladki or ladke kii marji se hoti he
 No permission is required from anyone for this
 shafin jahaan banaam keem ashokan or anya ke maamle main supreme court ne apana faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki anuchhed 21 ke tahat shaadi karne kaa adhikaar har kisi kaa moulik adhikaar he
 No one can snatch it without the procedure established by law
 shafin jahaan banaam ashokan ke maamle main haadia urf akhila ashokan ne apana dharm badal diya tha or muslim ban gai thi
 After this he married Shafin Jahan
 supreme court ne haadia ke paksh main faisla sunaate hue unki shaadi ko sahi tehraaya tha
 Apart from this, in another judgment, the Supreme Court has even said that the right to live life under Article 21 also comes to live life with dignity
 iske liye vyakti ko apni marji se jivan saathi chunane or shaadi karne kaa adhikaar he
 Not only this, a person can also change religion according to his wish
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki anuchhed 21 ke tahat jivan jeene ke adhikaar kaa matlab jaanavar kii tarah jivan jeene ke adhikaar se nahin he
 The Supreme Court's decision in the case of Shafeen Jahan vs KM Ashokan bharat ke shandaar nagariko,9 november, 2019 ko supreme court babari masjid - ram janmabhumi bhoomi vivaad par faisla sunaane ja rahaa he
 The case is decades old
 donon pakshon kii taraf se aisi koi baat nahin, jise lekar public main bahes nahin hui he
 People of both communities have also given their lives
 jitna kahana tha, sunanaa tha, likhnaa tha, vah sab ho chukaa he
 Everything has been told lies and truth
 pachaason kitaaben likhi gayi hai
 We or you are not unaware of anything
 kai saal tak bahes or hinsa ke baad sabhi pakshon main is raay par sahmati bani thi ki adaalat kaa jo bhi faisla aayega, vahi maanya hoga
 It was a great achievement that everyone came to a conclusion that what the court would say, they would accept
 to ab ise sabit karne kaa mauqaa aa rahaa he
 On September 30, 2010, a decision has been taken in this matter
 elahabaad hoicourt ne vivaadit 2
 The 77 acres of land was divided into three sides
 us saal or us din bharat ke nagarikon ne adbhut paripakvata kaa parichay diya tha
 Didn't think that we had fought for decades on this issue
 hamane sabit kiya tha ki mohabbat se bada kuch nahin he
 Nothing happened anywhere
 tab bhi nahin hua, jab elahabaad court se nikalakar sab apni-apni asantushti zaahir kar rahe the or supreme court jane kii baat kar rahe the
 We will prove it this time too
 thik he, ham bahes karte hai
 We keep fighting over issues, but when it comes time to prove love, we will prove love
 harsh karnaa he, na malaal rakhana he
 Join the part in which the decision comes
 yah mulk ek faisale se bahut bada he
 Today is not a historical day
 30 sitambar, 2010 ko bhi aitihaasik ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Now nobody remembers that decision nor history
 isliye saamaanya rahiye
 Listen to the decision
 baaten bhi kiijie, lekin santosh manaaie ki yah masalaa khatm ho rahaa he
 We have to give our beloved country a more elevated place
 achche skool banane hai
 Hospitals are to be built
 aisi nyaaypalika banani he, jahaan jaj kaa iqbaal ho
 Justice met on time
 police ko aisa bananaa he ki jahaan ek mahila IPS bheed se pit jane ke baad chup na rahe
 We have to make a lot
 raajnneeti aisi banani he, jise koi udyogpati peeche se na chalaae
 There is a lot to do
 naukariyaan ja rahi hai
 People's businesses are sinking
 naujavaanon kaa jivan barbaad ho rahaa he
 We all have to return to these questions soon
 isliye dilon main daraar na aae
 Keep the arms spread
 koi haath milaane aae, to khinchakar gale laga lijie
 We will give love to this quarrel
 ham baaqi zimmedaariyon main fail ho chuke netaaon ko galat sabit kar denge
 Will prove politics to be small
 bharat ke nagarikon kaa kirdaar aise faisalon ke samay bada ho jaataa he
 November 9 is the day of common people
 aam log 2010 kii tarah phir sabit karenge ki ham 2019 main bhi vahi hai
 As soon as i landed at Dubai Airport for the Sharjah Book Fair, i got the news that the decision is coming on 9 November
 meri pratikriya saamaanya thi
 In 2010, Sihran was born
 jane kya hoga, soch-sochakar ham lakhanu gaye the
 On the day of the decision, UP and the rest of India behaved so normally that by evening it seemed that there were so many meetings about safety in vain
 jhuthemooth kar march hote rahe
 Everyone was engaged in their work
 acha hota, ham bhi lakhanu na aate or apni family ke saath hote
 i am sure that the day of November 9 will be lost somewhere in Wikipedia
 log saamaanya rahenge or somvaar se apane apane kaam par jute jaaenge
 Like i will keep working for the work i have come for
 gita main sambhaav kii baat kahi gai he
 Sambhav means keeping the emotions balanced
 ek samaan rakhana
 Tomorrow i am getting rid of this issue as well
 faisale ko lekar jo bhi vishleshan chape, use saamaanya rup se padhie
 Not emotionally
 jaanane ke liye padhie
 Read to remember haar yaa jeet ke liye nahin
 If you don't like it, don't bully and don't like it, then don't dance
 sach kehane kaa vaataavaran bhi aapako hi bananaa he
 Also of courage and restraint
 2010 main media ne shandaar kaam kiya tha
 There was great restraint
 is baar aisa nahin he
 But we have come to know the reality of this media
 ab somvaar tak news channel band kar den
 Stay away from news channels for two to four days
 mohallon main awaz den ki tivi se dur rahen
 There are other mediums through which news can be heard
 radio suniye
 Listen to the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister and the main leaders of the opposition
 supreme court kii website par jaakar faisale ko khud padhie
 Stay away from unnecessary spokespersons in channels
 kisi netaa kii baat mat suniye
 Do not be stressed by an anchor shouting
 muskurie
 Those who get nervous, grab it and drink tea
 kahie relax, tension mat lo

 The early trends in the Lok Sabha elections are not going to please the BJP and there is a mood of disappointment in the party headquarters
 subah lagbhag 9 baje hi mukhyalay aae party ke varisht netaa vijay kumaar malhotra ne kaha, 'dilli main hamaare paas pehle bhi ek hi seat thi isliye hamaare paas khone ko kuch nahin he
 'does the party see any room for improvement in this situation? At this he appeared somewhat disappointed and said, 'wait
 ' malhotra ne kaha ki shuruaati rujhaan ko dekhte hue yah baat saaf he ki bijepi kii dilli ikai ko chust durust karne kii jarurat he
 Asked about the initial trends, party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar declined to comment
 unhone bas itnaa hi kaha ki abhi kaaphi samay baaki he or final rijlat kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes AB de Villiers should relinquish the captaincy from the ODI
 smith ko lagata he ki devilliars ko sara dhyaan ballebaaji par lagaana chahie or unhen captaini se istipha de dena chahie
 Declare captaincy and concentrate on batting De Villiersmith said, 'de Villiers needs to give up captaincy to concentrate in his batting
 ye unke kariyar or unke liye behad jaruri he
 De Villiers has done much for South Africa
 ab jab saal 2019 ke vishwa cap main maatr 2 saal kaa samay rah gaya he, to aise main unhen feet rahane kii jarurat he
 De Villiers has done a lot for South Africa
 Smith further said that de Villiers does not need to prove anything to anyone
 wo ek star khilaadi hai, unhone dakshin africa ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he
 Those who are criticizing de Villiers should be asked whether they want to see De Villiers play in the next series or they want to play the 2019 World Cup
 aapako bataa den ki devilliars pichley kuch samay se lagaataar team kaa hissaa nahin rahe hai or wo pichley ek saal se zyada samay se test team se baahar chal rahe hai or iske kaaran unhen kaaphi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa rahaa he
 In August, the de Villiers Champions Trophy was also hit by critics due to poor performance
 khabaren is baat kii bhi hai ki abi devilliars agast main test cricket main apane bhavishya ko lekar faisla kar sakate hai
 There are reports that De Villiers will meet Cricket South Africa officials and will tell them about his decision
 agar board unhen test cricket khilne ke liye nahin kahata to wo is formet se sanyas le lenge

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath pehle din se hi sakht or tabadatod faisle le rahe hai
 But these decisions of Yogi have still not affected many of his ministers
 yogi ne sabhi mantriyon ko chitthee likh chetavanee di he ki vah apni sampatti kaa byoraa jald se jald karen
 Let us tell you that on the very first day, Yogi had asked the ministers to give details of their assets within 15 days
 sirf 13 mantriyon ne diya byoraasutron ke mutabik, abhi tak sirf 13 mantriyon ne apni sampatti kaa byoraa mukhyamantri ko saunpa he
 This is why Yogis are taking a hard stand on this
 abhi yogi sarkaar ko ek hi maheenaa hua he, or yah duusari baar he ki jab yogi ko apane mantriyon ko hi apane aadesh kii yaad dilaani padi
 Also read - One month of Yogi government- Learn what happened to the 5 big electoral promises? Ministers' code of conduct has been issued: On Tuesday itself, CM Yogi has issued a new decree for his ministers, with this decree on ministers The Code of Conduct has come into force
 iske tahat sabhi mantriyon ko kaha gaya he ki vah thekedaari se dur rahe, to vahiin mahange hotalon main rukne kii bajaay sarkari guest house main hi ruke
 Apart from this, Yogi has also given many more instructions
 ye bhi padhein - yogi sarkaar ke SUPER-30 faisle jo uttar pradesh ko banaaenge uttam pradeshcircuit house main ruke mantriyogi adityanath kaa saaf maananaa he ki agar pradesh ko acha bananaa he, to phir mantriyon ko bhi acha hi hona padegaa
 Yogi has ordered the ministers that if any minister gets a gift of more than Rs 5000, he will go directly to the government treasury
 iske saath hi mantri kisi bhi shahar kii yatra ke dauraan kisi bade hotel main rukne kii bajaay kii circuit house yaa guest house main hi rukenge

 kaarobaar kii aamadani kaa den lekha-jokhyogi ne apane farmaan main kaha he ki sabhi mantri mahangi daavat or dikhaave se dur rahe
 The family of the minister abstained from any kind of government contracts, supplies or leases
 iske saath hi sabhi mantriyon se mantri pad grahan karne se pehle ke kaarobaar or usase hone vaali aamadani ke bare main jaankaree dene ko kaha gaya he
 You will have to give information about the jewelery, the Yogi has asked his ministers for information about all the gold and silver jewels that they have, as well as if there is a ministerial partner in a company, then the Chief Minister will also have to give information about it
 haalanki abhi yah aadesh maukhik rup se di gai he
 Delhi Karamalila Maidan is all set for the Modi Maharaeli
 manch saj chukaa he, logon kaa pahunchnaa bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Just waiting for Prime Minister Modi, who will reach here at around 11 am
 lekin modi kii raily se pehle dilli kii sadaken postaron se pat gai hai
 They are asking sharp questions not in support of the postmodern rally
 haalanki postaron par kisi vyakti yaa party kaa naam nahin likhaa he, aaj tak se baat karte hue AAP netaa ne sweekaar kiya ki ye poster unki party kii ore se lagaae gaye hai
 Actually on Friday, the same type of questions were raised by Aam Aadmi Party leader and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Twitter, the same questions are also seen in these posters
 jis ramlila maidan main shanivaar ko piem modi raily kar rahe hai usee maidan main kejariwal kii alpamat sarkaar ne shapath bhi lee thi
 Before the Maharali of Ramlila Maidan, Kejriwal has thrown a new bet by throwing the dice of full state to Delhi
 Tomo Modi ji addresses Del
 He had promised full statehood to Del
 Will he announce that tomo? Or will BJP do a U-turn on this issue also?— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)january 9, 2015dilli main chunaav kaa shor he or bijepi kii ore se is shor ko jeet main badalane kaa jimmaa ek baar phir piem narendra modi par he
 Modi's smokeless rallies brought the BJP to power in not one or two but three states and waved the lotus symbol of victory
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main modi ke chehre ne camel khilaayaa he to jaahir se bijepi unke chehre kaa istemaal dilli main bhi kar rahi he
 But the Aam Aadmi Party is asking serious questions
 PM addressing Delhi tomorrow for the 1st time
 What are your expectations from him tomorrow? Tweet with # delhiaskspmmodiand we will RT! - Aam Aadmi Party (@aamaadmiparty) January 9, 2015 AAP has tapped the BJP on many issues ranging from power, water and corruption to women safety
 Before polls, BJP announced 30% redn in elec rates
 Delhi eagerly hoping that PM wud announce that tomo # delhiaskspmmodi — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) January 9, 2015 The Aam Aadmi Party is attacking BJP through posters to target PM Modi's rally
 ramlila maidan ke paas bhi kai cites par aise posters lagaakar piem modi se dilli ke vikaas ke unke plan par sawaal puche gaye hai
 Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh has also questioned Modi on the issue of electricity and full statehood by tweeting
 Will Modi make an announcement abt full statehood to Delhi with police powers today from Ramlila ?as he promised to grant if he becomes PM!— ashutosh (@ashutosh83b)january 10, 2015 In Karnataka, a wife, along with her lover, put her husband to death

 bihar ke bodhgaya main maujuud mahabodhi mandir main hue nau serial dhamaake beshak bahut taqatvar nahin the, lekin in dhamaakon kii gunj dur tak sunai padi
 On the morning of 07 July 2013, the doors of the temple were opened just a few minutes after the sudden explosion of one of the nine famous blasts at this world famous religious place at 5
25 pm, not only shook this temple complex, but the whole world
 gave
 suraksha intjaam dhare rah gaye33 minute ke samyantaral main 9 dhamaake ho gaye
 Mahabodhi Temple is one of the most important pilgrimage places in Buddhism and an international tourist spot
 or aise main in dhamaakon ko bihar se lekar burma tak khalabali machana lazimi tha
 The truth is that the terrorists had planted bombs all around the temple, denouncing all security arrangements as data
 33 minute main hue nau dhamaakemandir main pehla dhamaakaa subah 5 bajkar 25 minute par thik us jagah par hua, jahaan bhagwaan buddha ko gyaan praapt hua tha
 Right now, people would be able to recover on this blast that the blasts happening at a distance of 2-2 minutes made the entire temple tremble
 chaaron ore afratfari fail gai or kisi ko kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki akhir wo jaaen to kahaan jaaen?serial blast main doosraa dhamaakaa ek ambulance kii tank main, teesraa mukhya mandir ke paas, chauthaa taradevi mandir main or paanchavaa dhamaakaa karmapa mandir main hua
 This was followed by the sixth and seventh blasts between the temple and the gate, while the eighth was near the statue of Lord Buddha and the ninth near a tourist bus
 is tarah ek-ek mandir parisar or aas-paas subah 5 bajkar 58 minute tak yani 33 minute main kul nau dhamaake ho gaye
 Five blasts including two monks injured five people, including two Buddhist monks, who arrived here to offer prayers
 inamen ek bhikshu myanmar kaa, jabaki doosraa tibet kaa he
 Police and nearby people sent the injured to the hospital for treatment
 inamen ek bhikshu kii haalat najuk bataai gai he
 The bombing of bombs laid on every side says that apart from the nine blasts on the spot, he also found three live bombs, which were lying near the 80 feet high statue of Lord Buddha and the bus stand
 in bamon ko baad main kabje main lekar bekaar kar diya gaya
 In this serial blast, there was no damage to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, but the tree under which Lord Buddha had done penance, definitely affected the tree
 maamle kii jaanch enie ke havaalegrih mantralay ne in serial blast ko aatankwaadi hamalaa qaraar dete hue is dhamaake kii jaanch aatankwaad se jude maamalon kii jaanch karne vaali enie ke hawaale kar di he
 This incident of explosion also becomes more serious because millions of Buddhist devotees come to this temple not only in India but also from Sri Lanka, China, Japan and all over Southeast Asia for worship
 ise kehete hai saanp guzarane ke baad lakeer peetna
 
 
 Despite repeated alerts and warnings, on the one hand, the Bihar police could not stop the serial blasts at Mahabodhi temple, on the other hand, the government is now investigating this matter and asking to punish the culprits
 sawaal he ki jab sarkaar ko is blast ke khatre ke maddenzar pehle hi aagaah kiya ja chukaa tha to akhir sarkaar kar kya rahi thi? pehle do baar ibi kaa alert mila, phir dilli police ne chetavanee jari kii
 Once again the IB was alerted and finally the serial was blasted
 khul gai police kii polaye naakaami tab he, jab ek nahin, do nahin, balki puure chaar baar bihar sarkaar ko mahabodhi mandir par hamale kii chetavanee di gai, lekin iske baavjood mandir kii suraksha vyavastha badhaane ke naam par sarkaar haath par haath dhare baithi rahi or nateeja kya hua, ye ab puri duniya jaanati he
 On October 12 last year, while cracking a module of the Indian Mujahideen, Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar had said in a press conference that this historic temple in Bodh Gaya was targeted by the terrorists
 lekin bihar police ne shaayad niraj kumaar ke is bayaan ko mahaz ek bayaan bhar samaj liya
 The IB had also issued alerts, so the matter of taking such a serious matter so lightly cannot be justified from anywhere, but when this warning from the Police Commissioner of Delhi, the intelligence agency IB, on three different occasions But the Bihar government had been warned about these attacks, so what else would this attitude of the government say if not Kahili? Myanmar is not changed? Right now on 28th of last month And clear the IB alerts for government-clear went talks about the dangers of targeting Bodhgaya, but the alert time of ten days had not passed that terrorists showed he who wanted it
 ibi ne apane is alert main bataaya tha ki kis tarah jamaat-tauhid-val-jehad naam kaa ek aatankwaadi sanghathan yahaan mahabodhi mandir ke alaava myanmar ke nagarikon ko apana nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 The videographers did not even talk about it by the terrorists
 dilli police kii chetavanee kii baat karen to german bekri dhamaakon ke silsile main pakade gaye makabool naam ke aatanki ne poochtacha main ye bataaya tha ki bodhgaya kaa mandir aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par he
 The police had also made it clear by revealing that Maqbool had already cleared the Mahabodhi temple's Reiki and videography for the attack
 ye sari jaankaree bihar sarkaar or local intelligence unit se saajha karne ke baavjood hue in hamalon ne sarkaar kii pole khol di
 How is this security arrangement? a big question is that in the temple where the prohibition of carrying only minor things like camera and mobile is kept in view, in that temple, terrorists entered with a dozen bombs and the security personnel stationed there Did not start ise logon kii jaan se khilwaad nahin kahenge, to or kya kahenge? ab beshak in hamalon ke baad police gunahagaaron kii dharpakad tej karne kaa daawa kare or antkavaadi sanghathan kii pahchaan bhi kar le, lekin jo nuksaan hua, yakeenan uski bharpai naammumkin he
 Is Abu Jindal's brain behind the conspiracy? Is the Indian Mujahideen behind the blasts too? According to intelligence agencies investigating the case, it has received similar indications in the investigation till now
 bodhgaya main aatank kii sajeesh kii paraten puri tarah khulani baaki he, lekin ab tak jaanch se jo suraag mil rahe hai, usamen aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin or iske sargana abu jindal kii chhap nazar aa rahi he
 Sketches of two suspects linked to serial blasts in Bodh Gaya have been released
 ye sketch sahidur rahamaan or sefiur rahamaan ke hai
 The IB had issued an alert to the Bihar Police about these two in the last week of June
 alert main kaha gaya tha ki ye donon aatanki gaya jane ke liye patna ghusane vaale hai
 However, despite accurate alerts, Bihar's security agencies failed to stop the terror plot
 dharmik sthal pehle se nishane parayahi nahin, pune blast ke ek anya aaropee katil siddiki ne bhi pune ke ganesh mandir or desh ke anya dharmik sthalon par hamale kii indian mujahidin kii sajeesh kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Clearly, the alert was ignored and Bodh Gaya, the biggest center of world peace, shook
 ab bihar police bhi maanati he sajeesh kii soochna thi or suraksha bhi badhaai gai thi, lekin wo naakaafi thi
 Myanmar's revenge in Hindustan? The plot of terrorist blasts in Bodh Gaya in Bihar is also being linked to the ongoing conflict between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Myanmar
 khufia agency ibi ko ye bhanak lagi thi ki myanmar main rohingya musalamaanon par ho rahe hamale kaa badla aatanki sanghathan hindustan main myanmar ke logon or thikaanon par hamalaa karke le sakate hain
 The IB was alerted in this regard on 28 June
 jamaat-tauhid-val-jehad naam ke aatanki sanghathan se khatre kii baat karte hue ibi ne baqayada chitthee likhakar ye alert kiya tha
 The murderous Kahily of the police, because a large number of Buddhists come to Bodh Gaya from Myanmar, the local security system should have been careful in view of the IB alert
 phir bhi alert kii andekhi hui
 On 23 October 2012, terrorist Syed Maqbool, who was arrested from Hyderabad, also revealed the conspiracy to attack in Bodh Gaya during interrogation
 aise main ab dilli police phir se makabool or un chaaron se aatankiyon se poochtacha karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Police will try to find out which module carried out this attack
 bodhgaya hamale kaa taliban conection!pakistan ke taharik-e-taliban ne teen maheene pehle apil kii thi ki myanmar kii ghatnaon par jihadiyon ko dhyaan dene chahie
 The question arises whether this appeal also has any connection with the attack? Not that the terrorists were taking directions from across the border? If the Myanmar theory is true then this is the first time that a foreign incident has been avenged on Indian soil
 yakeenan khatarnaak trend ho saktaa he

 (input bhashaa se) Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has entered politics from the cricket world, is getting the latest news that he can join the Congress anytime
 aapako bataa den ki siddhu ne kuch samay pehle hi bhaajapa ko alavida kaha tha
 Sidhu has so far hit many fours and sixes on the electoral pitch in Punjab, first he left the Rajya Sabha seat of BJP, then he also left the membership of BJP, then he got the news of going with Arvind Kejriwal, then he said 'awaaz-e -punjab 'announced

 paala badalte hi siddhu par chale bhaajapai tir- punjab ke dipti siem sukhbir badal ne ek nijee kaarykram main shirkat karte vakt navjot singh siddhu ko 'chale hue kaartoos' bataaya tha
 Union Minister and Punjab BJP chief Vijay Sampla had targeted Sidhu, saying that he had 'bowed down to the court' of Rahul Gandhi, whom he used to make fun of by calling him 'pappu'
 - punjab bhaajapa ke pramukh vijay saanpala ne siddhu par aarope lagaaya ki bharat ko ‘sone kii chidiya’ banane main lage pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chhodkar vah ‘sonia kii chidiya’ ban baithe

 The Shiv Sena said that those who are questioning the destruction of agricultural produce during the strike should also answer that when the farmers were not going on strike, was there no wasting? Shiv Sena raised the question, "crude oil prices have come down to their lowest level but has inflation come down? Last year, good monsoon resulted in huge yields but did the prices of vegetables come down? Three years have passed but have the promises of 'good days' been fulfilled?'

 The Uttar Pradesh government has come under controversy as soon as the booklet of tourism destinations is released

 At the same time, the first page of the booklet is on the Ganga Aarti of Varanasi and the second page has a picture of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi
 iske alaava bocolate main paryaton vikaas yojanaon ke bare main bhi bataaya gaya he
 Please tell that the Yogi government is often in the headlines regarding the Taj Mahal
 haal hi main sarkaar ne tajmahal ko upi kii saanskrithik viraasat list main shumaar nahin kiya tha
 It is said that CM Yogi Adityanath has a different opinion about the Taj Mahal
 ek media report ke mutabik, bihar kii darbhanga raily main yogi ne yah tak kah diya tha ki unke liye tajmahal ek imaarat ke sivaa or kuch nahin he
 Explanation given by UP government

 Other parents, frustrated by the Juvenile Justice (protection of Children) Act, 2000, make a similar complaint

 When he talks about his eight-year-old son Satyam, the victim of kidnapping, it becomes difficult for him to stop his tears and his wife Rakhi starts sobbing
 may, 2009 ko 15 saal ke do ladakon ne unke nanhen bachche ke saath younachaar karne ke baad uski hatya kar di thi
 When Satyam shouted in pain, the boys strangled him to death
 phir uskaa shav polithine ke jhole main bharkar phone par rajesh se phiroti maangi
 Those boys were arrested on 30 May
 ve donon sudhaar grih main adhiktam teen saal kii sajaa kaatane ke baad ab aaazaad gum rahe hai
 This crime has changed the lives of Rajesh and Rakhi forever
 rajesh kehete hai, ‘‘is juvenil justise system se kharaab or kya ho saktaa he? unhone badi berahami se mere maasoom bete kii hatya kar di or sudhaar grih main teen saal gujaarne ke baad phir se aaazaad gum rahe hai
 What is the system in which the victim suffers and the criminal is freed? Would you call it justice? Both those killers roam freely in Patna and i try my best not to see them
 yah mere seene main kisi nashtar kii tarah chubhta he
 The Juvenile Justice (JJ) law emphasizes the humane treatment of juveniles who commit crimes
 kanoon kishor ke aparaadh ko aparaadh to maanata he lekin use sudharne ke liye ek or mauka detaa he
 Sanjeev Kumar, a lawyer in the Patna High Court, asks, "it seems fine, but where is the point of stopping him from committing the crime again?" The alleged improvement in this is usually worse than crime
 bharat ke 815 bal sudhaar grihon main uski kshamta se adhik apradhi bachche bhare hue hai, jahaan puri suvidhaayen bhi nahin hai or peshewar dhang se kaam karne vaale yogya logon kii baari kami he
 Presently there are 17 lakh accused juveniles who need constant counseling
 zyaadaatar sudhaar grihon main to paramarshdaata bhi nahin hai
 Their employees are extremely scared of juvenile criminals
 ve kabhi-kabhaar hi paraamarsh kaa samuhik seshan lete hai, jahaan aprashikshit samajashastri paraamarsh dene kaa kaam karte hai
 In these correctional homes, children usually form gangs and start committing heinous crimes such as murder and rape, starting from petty crimes like snatching cellphones and committing petty burglaries with no restrictions
 2011 ke shuru main dilli kaa kukhyat ‘‘looto or aag lagaao’’ gang aise hi kishoron kaa giroh tha, jo kingsve camp ke seva kutir sudhaar grih ke ladakon ne milakar banaaya tha
 This gang, led by a boy who escaped from the correctional home, carried out crimes in government colonies and surrounding areas such as Sarojini Nagar and Laxmibai Nagar
 ve gharon main ghuskar choriyaan karte or phir use aag ke hawaale kar dete the, taaki saare saboot mit jaaen
 The gang leader had been arrested several times before and had also run away from the correctional home at least three times
 ab 18 saal kii umr paar karne ke baad vah tihaad jail main vichaaradhin kaidi he
 The JJ Act empowers the police not to file an FIR against the juvenile if the punishment for the alleged crime is less than seven years
 isse vah kishor hatya, hatya kii koshish or balaatkaar ko chhodkar har tarah kaa aparaadh karne ke liye aaazaad he
 The police do not register firs against them in cases of petty crimes, which leads them to dare to commit big crimes
 nateeja yah hota he ki ye kishor aparaadh ke chakra main funskar rah jate hai
 As can be seen in the case of juvenile accused of gang rape
 apane chah bhai-bahanon main sabase bada vah ladkaa 11 saal pehle uttar pradesh ke badaayun jile main apana kaccha ghar chhodkar chalaa gaya tha
 Her father is mentally ill and her family is one of the poorest families in the village

 Counselors working with him say that there is a certain kind of psychosis in him
 is tarah ke logon ko samajhnaa sabase mushkil kaam hota he
 Delhi-based clinical psychologist Dr
 rajat mitra kehete hai, ‘‘kareeb 30-35 fisadi bal apradhi manovikruti ke shikaar hote hai, jinamein 10 varsh tak ke bachche bhi shaamil hai
 They know how to trap prey
 yahaan tak ki ve counsalaron tak ko jhansa dene kii koshish karte hai ki ve sudhar chuke hai
 Bharti Ali of Haq Sansthan tells of a similar teenager who was brought after repeated crimes
 pehali baar use hatya kii koshish ke aarope main laayaa gaya, lekin uske khilaaf koi saboot na hone se use chhod diya gaya
 a few days later, he was brought in for another attempted murder and sentenced
 jab vah sudhaar grih main sajaa kaat rahaa tha, to usne hangaamaa karne or khidakiyon ke shishe todgaye ke baad bhaagane kii koshish kii
 Ali says, "he was going to be 18 in a few days and from there he was sent to Tihar
 ’’ ali ke mutabik, ‘‘vah ladkaa dekhne main bahut aakarshak tha or bollywood ke hero kii tarah dikhataa tha
 "child crime is not limited to only the poorer sections of society
 march, 2012 main haryana ke ek vidhayak ke kishor umr ke pautra par chah vayask logon ke saath milakar jaipur emity uniwarsity main beatech ke tisare varsh ke chaatr prashanth vir kii hatya kaa aarope laga tha
 Although the Juvenile Justice Board wanted to keep him in custody for a long time, the family of the accused secured bail for him
 umr kii simaaen dhundhlee pad gai hai
 Because of this, juvenile offenders take advantage of the JJ Act
 patna main bal aparaadh ke maamalon se jude vakil maanate hai ki is kanoon main umr kii seemaa kaa sabase zyada durupyog kiya jaataa he kyonki kishor apradhi isi seemaa kaa phayda uthaakar kadi sajaa se batch jate hai
 It is being taken advantage of throughout the country
 isiilie kanoon visheshgyon, manovigyaniyon or kanoon lagu karne waalon kii ore se kishor apradhi kii umr kii seemaa 18 saal se ghataakar 16 saal kiye jane kii maang kii ja rahi he
 But the child rights lobby is against it
 purv dijipi or prayaas naam ke enjio ke sansthaapak aamod kanth bal aparaadhiyon or upekshit bacchon ke saath kaam karte hai
 They say that the law should not be changed due to some exceptions
 jeje act kii ruparekha taiyaar karne waalon main shaamil rahe aamod kanth kehete hai ki kanoon main 2000 main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha or tab duniya bhar ke niyamon ko dekhte hue kishor aparaadh ke liye umr seemaa 16 saal se badhaakar 18 saal kar di gai thi
 It will not be easy to reduce it again to 16 years as India has signed three international agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), Beijing Rules and Riyadh Guidelines
 iske alaava bharat main vayask kii umr 18 saal maani gai he
 No person before this age has the ability to vote, marry and drive a vehicle
 kanth kehete hai ki umr kii seemaa kam karnaa koi hal nahin he
 The solution lies in applying the JJ law properly
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar yah act lagu karne main asafal rahi he, phir bacchon ko kyon dosha diya jaae?’’ kanoon desh ke har jile main ek bal kalyaan samiti, ek bal helpline (1018), bal apradhi justise board, kishor kalyaan adhikari, sudhaar grih or sajaa puri hone ke baad dekhbhaal kaa ek kaarykram chalaane ke liye kahata he
 But most of these provisions of the law are limited to papers only, especially its most important aspect i
e
 consultation
 is tarah kaa koi aankada uplabdh nahin he ki kitne bal aropiyon kaa vastav main punarvaas ho paata he
 According to government statistics, only about 10 percent of the teenagers are involved in crime again
 lekin yah sirf ek anumaan he, kyonki niyam ke mutabik, police kishor kii sajaa puri hone ke baad uske sabhi record nasht kar detii he
 If he commits a crime when he is an adult, his name is not added as a reprimand
 bahut se maamalon main aparaadh ke kaaran kishor kaa saahas or bad jaataa he, khaskar jab vah pakadaa jaataa he
 Immediately after the arrest of the juvenile criminals, the policemen questioning them are shocked that they do not regret their actions
 ek police adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘maine kishoron ko yah bataate hue suna he ki kis tarah unhone peedit ke haath pakade or vah aadhi behoshee kii haalat main chatpataata rahaa
 They seem to enjoy killing
 ’’sambhav he ki dilli ke gang rape ke kishor balaatkaari ko peedit ladki ke dard se karaahne par majaa aata rahaa ho
 If he is truly psychopathic then he can commit crime even after he is released at the age of 20 years
 juvenil justise lau, jo use jaldi hi aaazaad hone kii chhot detaa he or jiske aparaadh ke record ko bhi mitaa dene ke liye kahata he, usamen nishchit hi sanshodhan kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Now the time has come to enact a new Children's Law, which takes into account not only the age, but also the seriousness of the crime
 samaaj or sarkaar khoonkhaar aparaadhiyon ke aaazaad ghoomane kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate, chaahe unki koi bhi umr ho
 There is no such thing as children in this rapacious 17-year-old rapist
