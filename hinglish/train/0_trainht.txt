 According to the prosecution, Harinarayan, a resident of Dalan Chhapragaon in Bairia police station area, married his daughter Seema on August 14, 2008 with Krishnakumar Yadav, resident of Bajraya Ka Tola village, with full custom
 shaadi ke turant baad hi sasuraal ke log dahej menjameen dene kii maang ko lekarsima ko pratadit karne lage
 He was beaten up

 input- bhashaa The list of demands from states that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has received is the longest list from Tamil Nadu ‚Äî there are a total of 25 demands in 28 pages
 mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalithaa wants to get the most out of her friend, after all, she has the strength of 37 Lok Sabha and 10 Rajya Sabha mps
 jayalalita jab 3 june ko apni maangon kii fehrist lekar unase milane ain to sitambar, 2013 ko modi ke bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee banane ke baad yah pehali mulaakaat thi
 Her relationship with Modi has always been sweet but she stayed away from him during the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin dosti ke achche dinon main modi ke gujarat model kii tarif karne main unhone kabhi hichak nahin dikhaai
 She attended all three of Modi's swearing-in ceremonies in 2002, 2007 and 2012 as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 to modi bhi may, 2011 main jayalalita ke mukhyamantri pad ke shapath grahan samaaroh main maujuud the
 But the Tamil Nadu assembly election is not far away and the case of Sri Lankan Tamils is at a boil, so she did not attend Modi's swearing in as the Prime Minister as she did not want to risk appearing with Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa
 rajpakshe ko is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, the NDA would like to keep Jayalalithaa happy, even though her demand list is quite long and heavy
 sirf isliye nahin ki rajyasabha (jahaan endie saansadon kii sankhya kam he) main unke 10 saansadon kaa sahyog milegaa balki jaisaa varisht rajnatik vishleshak ahamed shabbir kehete hai, ''baat sahyog kii bhi he
 Modi government may take some tough policy decisions like Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), in such a situation, showing consensus of political parties may be in the interest of the government
 agar jayalalita inkaa virodh karti hai to trinmul congress (tiemasi), biju janata dal (bijedy) or vampanthi dal bhi unke saath aa sakate hai
 And the BJP will never want to see those who oppose Modi's agenda unite
 ‚Äùlekin tamilnadu kii maangon main kuch modi ke liye chunauti bhi ho sakati hai
 7,000 crore of sales tax
 turant waapas kiye jaaen jo centre sarkaar ke dey hai
 4,000 crores from Jayalalithaa from Delhi
 bhi maange hai jo unhone centre pryojit yojanaon ke tahat kharch kiye hai
 Her state is facing two to four power shortages, so she wants Modi to give 15 per cent of the power that was not distributed from the central power stations in the state (total 450 MW)
 inamen kudankulam newclear bijli sanyantr kii kamishand ikaiyaan, tutikorin kii neveli lignite korporation or vellore main antipisi kaa jevi project shaamil he
 The Cauvery issue is also fueling sentiment in the state, hence Jayalalithaa has called for the Cauvery Management Board and the Water Regulation Committee to implement the final decision of the 2007 Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal
 2013 main upie sarkaar ne ise notiphoi kiya tha
 Once the board and committee's decision comes into force, Tamil Nadu will have the right to open the water reservoir of the dam built on the river, which will bring water to the state
 rajya ke ek afasarshah kehete hai, ''haalanki hamane karnataka ke khilaaf supreme court main mukadmaa jeet liya lekin vah supreme court ke aadesh ko lagu nahin kar rahaa or hamen apekshit jal nahin de rahaa kyonki jal kapaaton ke prabandhan kaa adhikaar ab bhi uske paas he
 ‚Äúmodi will have to persuade the BJP in Karnataka because this issue is equally big and important here
 jayalalita kii duusari maangon main 13wein vitt ayog ke tahat parformens grant bhi shaamil he, jisane 2011-12 se 2014-15 ke liye 1,888 karod ru
 Was recommended to give
 lekin ab tak 125 karod ru
 Have only met jayalalita kaa daawa he ki unke rajya ne nau main se chah sharten puri kii thim or shesh teen par bhi kaaphi kaam kiya tha
 The General Sales Tax (GST) is also another issue that she wants Modi to address
 unhone jor diya ki prastaavit jiesti mudda unke rajya kii swaittata ko prabhavit karegaa or yah nuksaan sthaayee hoga, isse utpaadan or niryaat par bhi bura asar padegaa
 Jayalalithaa has suggested an alternative, she wants the right to levy tax in a state, tax collection and autonomy as an alternative to VAT, the right to central excise and service tax should be given to the state while the center focuses on inter-state taxation
 Used to be
 jayalalita ne rajya police ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye atirikt 10,000 karod ru
 Has also demanded iske alaava, rajya transport korporation ko eendhan kii dohari keemton se mukt rakhana chaahati hai
 But it will be more difficult for Modi to fulfill his political demands
 jayalalita chaahati hai ki bharat sanyukt raashtra main grihayuddh main 'narsanhaar‚Äô ke liye srilanka kii aalochana karne sambandhi prastaav laae
 She also wants the government to propose a referendum for a separate 'eelam' between Sri Lankan Tamils and displaced Tamils around the world
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki modi srilanka se kachativu waapas le len
 Sri Lanka has been the base of the Navy to take action against strayed Tamil fishermen in the Palk strait-central
 jayalalita kii ek or maang yah he ki narendra modi 1974 or 1976 ke samjhaute ko khatm kar den jiske tahat vah dweep srilanka ko diya gaya tha
 In 1991, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly also passed a resolution under which the island and the sea around it were to be given to India
 jayalalita kii yachika 2008 se supreme court main lambit he
 Senior AIADMK leaders are hopeful that Modi will accept these demands
 2011 main mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi jayalalita centre se ladaai lard rahi hai, unhone tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ke paas darjanon doot bheje haalanki adhiktar ko koi jawaab nahin mila
 Their protests and demands included everything from the Sri Lankan army's kidnapping and assault of Tamil fishermen to the government's apathy to power - and more
 ve upie ke sajaavati kaarykram khaadya suraksha vidheyak kii bhi mukhar aalochak rahi hai
 He wrote to Manmohan Singh, "states should have the right to formulate and implement schemes in a federal structure where states have close relations with the public
 ‚Äù unka yah bhi kahana tha ki isse rajya sarkaar par 1,800 karod ru
 Will have an extra weight of party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''hamaare to donon haathon main laddu hai
 We need the center and ours
 hamane kuch anokhi maang to rakhi nahin he
 "that means the ball is now in the prime minister's court
 hamaare desh kii rajdhani ke sabase vyastatam bazaaron ke taur par shumaar kiye jane vaale chandani chowk main 1 april se bina registration ke rickshaw nahin chalenge
 The High Court has given this order in the Chandni Chowk beautification case
 gauratlab he ki chandani chowk redeveopment ko lekar kai yachikaayen hai court main chal rahi thim
 During the hearing, many questions arose that rickshaws are the major reason for the jam in this area
 aise kai rickshaw hai jo in ilaakon main bina registry ke chalate hai
 The High Court ordered the setting up of large camps in this case
 The High Court had also ordered agencies to set up large camps twice for registration of rickshaws
 kareeb 500 rickshaw is camp main register bhi ho chuke hai
 Those who have not done now will not be able to walk in the area of chandni Chowk after April 1
 gauratlab he ki puri dilli main kareeb 20 lakh se upar rickshaw hai or har roj is ilaake main bhi 50 hajaar se upar rickshaw chalaae ja rahe hai
 However, registration has been done only for 500-600 rickshaws
 is registration kaa makasad na sirf chaalkon kii pahchaan karnaa he balki avaidh rup se chal rahe rickshon par bhi lagaam lagaana he
 Non-governmental organizations have petitioned the problem of traffic jam often in Chandni Chowk
 is aitihaasik ilaake ke astiswa ko lekar bhi kai baar sawaal uthe hai
 The High Court had earlier banned driving of rickshaws at Chandni Chowk after hearing some petitions but then some ngos petitioned that thousands of people would be unemployed

 What can't a newspaper do? rajasthan main nagaur jile ke choti khatu gaanv ke balaprasad joshi or jugal kishor jatholiya ko bhi akhbaar or saahitiyik kitaaben padhane kaa aisa hi shauk tha
 In this jugaad, they kept on beating their hands and feet here and there
 40-50 kitaaben ikatthi hone ke baad unhone teen ru
 Took a room for a month's rental
 uske baahar ke baraamde main ek takhta rakhaa
 They would both come and spread books every evening
 khud bhi padhate or dusron ko bhi bitha-pakadakar padhwaate

 Over time, the library began to take a big shape
 1967 main ek bhamashah ne iske liye jameen di to kaiyon ne paise die
 Villagers also openly donated furniture for the furniture in the Jodhpur stone building
 lekin kahin par kisi kaa naam nahin goda gaya
 Kapurchand Betala, in-charge of the library, says, "on the condition of anonymity, financial help has been taken from the people
 paise vaale to paise dekar naam likhva lete hai lekin un logon kaa kya, jinhone iske liye apana pasinaa bahaya, mehnat kii
 a letter of help came from the government as well, but the managing committee people refused to take it because they did not want its condition to be the same as other government libraries
 is pustkaalay kii ore se pichley 21 saal se har saal dinadayal upaadhyaay sahitya sammaan or pichley do saal se kanhaiyalaal sethiya maid bhashaa sammaan bhi diya ja rahaa he
 There should never be any allegations about money and money, for this, arrangements were made to audit the library every year and maintain transparency of accounts

 It is believed that Lalit woke up to an interview with God and pushed the family towards mass suicide
 police kii jaanch main ab shaq kii sooyee lalit kii taraf gum rahi he
 It seems that Fine may have suffered from mental illness
 rishtedaaron kaa kahana he kuch maheene se lalit apane pita kii aawaaj main baaten karne laga tha
 After the father's death, he claims that the father is visible to him
 aisa lag rahaa he ki lalit shared psycotic disorder yaa dilushan naam kii bimaari kaa shikaar tha
 Its victims feel that someone is saying something to his ears
 is beemaari ke shikaar log dusron ko bhi vahi feel karwaanaa chaahate hai jo wo kar rahe hai
 It is being told that Lalit used to talk about the dream of his dead father
 lalit ke haathon main koi rassi bhi bandhi nahin mili thi, jiske baad puri padtaal usee par kendrit ho gai he
 The crime branch has started exploring the history of Lalit's life

 How did Lalit's voice go and how did he return? The police found the register near the temple in the house, notes in the same handwriting
 ye likhaai lalit kii hi lag rahi he
 The register was being written since December 2017, and on 26 June four pages of the register were filled together
 handriting ke bare main lag rahaa he ki puraa parivaar hi lalit kii baton par bharosa karata tha
 These rituals were also done according to Lalit
 faansee ke fandaper latakane kii kriya bhi isi anushthan kaa hissaa bataai ja rahi he
 According to the post-mortem report, many of the family members did not eat on the day of the execution
 vaise jis tarah ghar main shaadi kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi thim or makaan main renovations ho rahaa tha, usase lag rahaa he ki lalit ko bharosa tha ki fande par latak kar bhi un logon kii jaan batch jaaegi
 Sadly this did not happen and a whole family was devastated
 13,800 karod ke kaale dhan ko ghoshit karke sabko chaunkaane vaale gujarati kaarobaari mahesh shah ko iskar vibhaag ne ahmedabad main hiraasat main le liya

 While queuing up to top Bihar milk production, it may be a matter of little relief for customers that another dairy cooperative association selling milk from the 'paras' brand has said that it has no plans to increase prices immediately
 paras doodh kii bhi dilli or rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main acchhee pahunch he
 a glass of milk contains twenty dangerous chemicals

 RS Sodhi, managing director of Gujarat Dairy Cooperative Federation, said that after this increase, 'amul Fresh' will be priced at Rs 29 in Delhi and NCR from Friday, which was Rs 28 earlier, while its slim and trim milk will cost Rs 25
 Per liter and Amul Gold (full cream) will be Rs 38, which till now was Rs 36
 bhartiya naslon kii gaay-bhainson kaa doodh zyada paushtieymul ne apane grih rajya gujarat main 25 july se hi keemat badha di he
 The hike in prices is applicable from July 10 in Mumbai
 sodhi ne kaha ki desh ke anya hisson main bhi doodh kii keemat badhaai jaaegi
 He said that prices have been increased due to increase in purchase price of milk

 Why was the economy devastated? sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar par khadey kiye kai sawalsonia gandhi ne kaha, 'aap hi bataaie ki is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki nahin ki jis kaala dhan laane ke liye notebandi kii thi wo kalaadhan baahar kyon nahin aayaa

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, writing a post on Facebook, separated the party from Sam Pitroda's statement and asked him to apologize
 rahul ne kaha ki 1984 kaa sikh danga aahat karne vaala tha
 Action has been taken against the perpetrators of this incident
 ham is narsanhaar kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 Earlier, the Congress has disassociated itself from this statement by issuing a letter
 congress ne kaha ki ham kisi bhi dange yaa sampradayik hinsa ke khilaaf hai or isko sweekaar nahin karte hai
 We are with the victims of the Sikh riots and are doing our best to bring them justice
 sam pitroda ke bayaan se khud ko alag karte hue congress ne kaha ki hamane apane netaaon se samvedansheel or sanbhalkar bayaan dene kii apil kii he
 The Congress said that we believe that just like the 1984 Sikh riots, the victims of the 2002 Godhra riots should get justice
 kisi bhi jati, dharm yaa panth ke khilaaf kiye gaye narsanhaar kaa congress samarthan nahin karti he
 Attacking BJP, Congress said that BJP gave ticket to Sadhvi Pragya, accused of Malegaon bomb blasts, but we took action against the leaders of 1984 riots

 1984 danga peediton ko ab tak insaaf nahin mil sakaa he or agar ye kaha jaae ki ab jo hua so hua use bhul jaao to ye kahana un danga peediton ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane jaisaa hoga
 Tomorrow you will say the same for the Godhra victims
 captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki 1984 dangon ke liye congress party nahin balki kuch log jimmedaar he
 If there were Congress people in it, then people associated with RSS and BJP were also involved in the riots
 main to pehle bhi kai baar kah chukaa hum ki congress party ke paanch log jinke naam main kai baar khule taur par letaa hum wo in dangon main shaamil the or unako lekar kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he, lekin main modi ji se sawaal poochna chahta hum ki agar aap rajeev gandhi ko 1984 sikh dangon ke liye jimmedaar tehra rahe hai to kya ham godhra ke liye aapako jimmedaar maane? kyonki aap bhi us vakt us rajya ke mukhyamantri the
 Targeting the BJP, CM Amarinder said that as far as i know Rajiv Gandhi was sitting in Bengal or Bihar when he got the news of the death of Indira Gandhi
 aise main unka haath in dangon main kaise ho saktaa he
 The second thing that is being said is that Rajiv Gandhi was monitoring the whole riots from his office
 ye bebuniyaad aarope he or isamen koi tark nahin he
 This is being said by Modi and the Akali Dal only for political gains
 agar wo congress or rajeev gandhi ko 1984 dangon ke liye jimmedaar tehraate hai to kya ham godhra ke liye bhi modi ko jimmedaar maane ye meraa unase sawaal he
 Captain Amarinder Singh alleged that the Akali Dal and BJP air the issue of 1984 Sikh riots for political gains every time during elections so that they can get votes

 But the chartered accountants continued to pressurize that the government should not use this provision of the Companies Act and the matter was prolonged

 He had said that it is surprising how the bank's auditors failed to catch such scams
 ek ke baad ek bank ghotaale saamne aane ke baad sarkaar ne bainkon se yah bhi kaha he ki 50 karod rupye se upar kii jo bhi enpie he usko tatkaal saamne laayaa jaae

 Along with this, it also boosts your confidence
 haalanki, iskaa ek paksh or bhi he
 After getting a 'good body' you are confronted with many such changes, which you may have never thought about
 jaaniye aisi 5 behad mahatvapurn baaten
 
 
 1
 apni badali kaaya ko itani aasaani se nahin pachaa paaenge aap!kai kilo vajan ghataane vaale kai aise log bhi hai, jo apni nai kaaya ke saath puri tarah se santulan nahin bitha pate hai
 Kirsten Griffin, who lost about 83 pounds in weight, told the English newspaper Huffington Post, 'even after 2 years of weight loss, I'm still upset about what i did? Losing weight was quite easy, but digesting the new body after that became a daily struggle for me
 ' clinical cycolgist aid abramsan ke mutabik log sochate hai ki nai kaaya milte hi chamatkaar jaisaa kuch hoga, lekin asaliyat isse alag hoti he
 It takes a little time for you to adopt this new body, but once you learn to adopt it, everything starts recovering
 2
 Lose weight but what about extra skin? If you have lost a good amount of weight then there is every possibility that you may have to suffer wrinkles and stretch marks and the most disappointing thing is that fat loss There is no option other than surgery to avoid this extra skin left after
 is surgery main paisa to kharch hota hi he, saath main iske kuch bure prabhaav bhi saamne aa sakate hai
 Therefore, think about this aspect beforehand
 3
 Be ready for change in some relationships too! You have to lose something to get something
 It is very likely that all your efforts for weight loss will turn you away from many people, because your eating habits, getting up and sitting are going to change many habits
 aapako in badlaavon ke saath-saath apano se jude rahane ke liye bhi kaaphi pasinaa bahaanaa hoga
 4
 puraani jeens or vah tishart ab saath nahin degivajan ghataane ke baad mili nai kaaya ko nae sies ke kapadon kii bhi jarurat padane vaali he or yah aapaki jeb dhili kiye bina to sambhav he nahin
 So get ready to spend afresh on your dress and lifestyle
 haalanki, nae kapadon kii kharidari main bahut jaldbaaji na karen or dhire-dhire apni almari ko nae doston se milawaayen
 5
 dost ab wo dost nahin rahaa!is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki aapmen aa rahe badlaav ko mahasoos kar rahe apane log aapaki bhalaai ke liye kai tarah ke suzav dene lagen, jo aapako nagavar gujaren
 Therefore, it is important not to take such 'advice' to heart and concentrate fully on your goal

 Will Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi give compensation to farmers this time too? On Monday, a tweet by CM Kejriwal gave the reason for giving hope to the farmers
 kejariwal ne twit kar kaha ki divisional kamishnar ko dilli main bemausam barish se hue fasal nuksaan kaa akalan karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 When asked by MLA of Narela and Parliamentary Secretary of Revenue Department, Sharad Chauhan, he said that the farmers have suffered loss and the loss assessment is going on
 kisaanon ko jis tarah hamane pichhali baar muawza diya tha, is baar bhi unke liye kuch naa kuch jarur karenge
 Unseasonal rains and hailstorm have also damaged crops in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi
 uttar pashchimi dilli ke kheda khurd gaanv ke kisaanon ke mutabik is baar gehun kii fasal ko pichhali baar baar se bhi zyada nuksaan hua he, lihaaza kejariwal sarkaar pichhali baar se zyada muaavja de
 Sundar, a farmer of Kheda Khurd village, had planted wheat on rent of 3 acres, but all was destroyed
 sundar kaa kahana he ki kareeb 80 fisadi fasal kharaab ho gai he
 His family of 8 is mainly dependent on farming, but due to crop failure many challenges are facing
 tippaniyan Chand Ram, a farmer who cultivates wheat on two acres, said that his loss is more than the last time, so while the Kejriwal government had given compensation of Rs 14,000 an acre last year, the compensation should be at least 20,000 this year
 kheda khurd ke hi kisaan rampat ke mutabiq is baar fasal itani zyada kharaab ho gai he ki khud ke khaane ke liye to dur jaanwaron ke liye bhi kuch nahin bachegaa
 Although there is not much cultivation in Delhi, but last year CM Kejriwal started the tradition of giving compensation to farmers in Delhi for the first time by giving a compensation of Rs
 20,000 per acre and a minimum compensation of Rs
 14,000 per acre
 isliye ab nazren kejariwal ke elaan par hai

 ) Enam Gambhir, the first Secretary of the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, once again gave a befitting reply to Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)

 There have been allegations by Pakistan that India is promoting terrorist activities in Islamabad
 shah mahmud kuraishi ne bharat par aarope bhi lagaaya ki saal 2014 main peshawar main hue schuli hamale main bharat kaa haath tha
 All these allegations were rejected outright by Enam
 unhone kaha ki ye pakistan dwaara bharat par badale kii bhaavana se lagaae gambhir aaropon main se ek he
 Enam said that India had mourned the tragic incident that occurred in Pakistan 4 years ago
 sansad ke donon sadanon main is mudde par shok vyakt kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, silence was kept in all schools of India for the peace of souls of the children killed
 kashmir ke mudde par pakistan ko jawaab dete hue inam ne kaha ki kashmir bharat kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he or hameshaa rahegaa

 Enam surrounded Pakistan on the issue of Hafiz Saeed and asked whether Pakistan would deny that Hafiz, declared a terrorist by the United Nations, does not roam freely in Pakistan? Does not come as a candidate in the elections? Let me tell you that the External Affairs Minister of India Sushma Swaraj while addressing the UN General Assembly on Saturday lashed out at Pakistan for terrorism
 jisase baukhalaaye pakistan neyuanmen kashmir kaa mudda uthaaya saath hi videsh mantri str kii vaarta radd kiye jane ko lekar bhi bharat par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki pakistan bharat se sabhi muddon par baatcheet karnaa chahta tha lekin bharat ne yah vaarta radd kar di

 He said that Pakistan is not only adept at executing the terrorist incident, but is also adept at hiding it

 Sushma Swaraj said that talks with Pakistan are not possible in the atmosphere of terrorism

 Questions are also coming out that those who were making videos of stunting of these two, why did they not stop them
 sirf video kyon banaate rahe
 Whether or not there is security at this tourist spot, if not, why not, these questions are yet to be answered

 After the prohibition of liquor in Bihar by the Nitish government, the BJP governments have also started taking steps in this direction
 kal madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne elaan kiya tha ki ve ek-ek kar rajya main sharaab kii dukaane band karenge, to aaj usee tarj par chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne bhi rajya main sharabbandi kaa elaan kar diya he
 The special thing is that Raman Singh made this announcement during his Bihar visit
 gauratlab he ki bihar main nitish kumaar sarkaar ne purna sharabbandi lagu kar rakhi he
 Bihar has become the second state to do so after Gujarat
 nitish shuru se hi kehete rahe hai ki kisi bhi pradesh main sharabbandi puri tarah se tabhi safal ho sakati he jab puure desh main ise band kar diya jaae
 Nitish's appeal seems to have started showing color
 somvaar ko madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ne kaha tha ki rajya main charanbaddh tareeke se sharabbandi lagu kii jaaegi
 Namami Devi Narmade - During a program under Narmada Seva Yatra in Neemkheda area of narsinghpur district, he said - in the first phase the state government will close all the liquor shops up to five kilometers along the banks of the Narmada River
 iske baad agle charan main rihaishi ilaakon main sharaab bandi kii jaaegi
 Shops will be closed around areas where educational institutions and religious places are located
 shivaraj kii tarj par aaj raman singh ne bhi chhattisgarh main charanbaddh tareeke ke sharabbandi lagu karne kaa elaan kiya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly addressing election rallies in Karnataka
 unki jansabhaon or road sho main baari taadaad par bheed jamaa ho rahi he
 But at a Raichur rally, PM Modi was confronted by a fan who had Modi's tattoo all over his body
 raily ke dauraan bheed main khadey is shaks par piem modi kii najar padi to unhone bich main hi apana bhaashan rokkar apane fain ko shart pahanane kii hidaayat thi
 PM Modi said, 'thankful for your love, you have made the whole body like this but i pray that in the meeting pay attention and wear the shirt
 unhone kaha ki naujavaanon se prarthana rahegi ki apane sharir koitna ksht nahin dijie
 After the appeal of PM Modi, the man standing in the crowd took the shirt immediately
 is bich raily main maujuud log utsahit ho uthe or jor-jor se narebaaji karne lage
 Basavaraj, who got tattooed after the rally, said that after 15 hours of hard work, he has got PM Modi's tattoo done on his body
 Raichur: Took 15 hours to get this done
 i got it made as PM has done good work in 4 years
 He mentioned me in his rally today & said that i should help BJP win elections in the state
 I'll never forget this day: Basvaraj, man who got PM Modi's face tattooed on his back # Karnatakapic

 Watch the video here: a scathing attack on Congress PM Modi while addressing the public meeting said that Congress has gone from every corner of the country, they should be wiped out from Karnataka as well
 ab karnataka ko koi nahin bachaa saktaa
 He said that the new mantra of the Congress is - lie, where you can speak, lie as much as you can
 yah unka abhiyaan he
 Accusing the deadlock in Parliament, the PM said that the Congress does not allow Parliament to function
 unako dar he ki modi ek ke baad ek kaam karte ja rahe hai, desh kii janata kaa vishwaas jitate ja rahe hai
 He said that Congress did not do any work to give constitutional rights to OBC commission, we did
 dalit, obisi, adivasee kii virdohi congress ne rajyasabha main ise paarit nahin hone diya
 Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhiki's style may be filmy, but Chanakya is just like everyone else
 maanjhi film nayak ke kirdaar kii tarah kaam karte najar aa rahe hai to chanakya kii tarah har kadam thok-bajaakar rakh rahe hai
 Is Manjhi's motive similar to that of a film hero or not? It would be difficult to say
 apane ko bihar ke chanakya ke taur par prachaarit karanevaale nitish kumaar ke raajnneetik jivan main ek daur aisa aayaa jab wo khud ko majdhaar main fansaa hua mahasoos kar rahe the
 Then he needed a 'manjhi' whom he can take a break on the helm until people forget about his crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 tabhi unhen jithan ram maanjhi kaa naam soojha
 Nitish thought that it would be 'manjhi', who would run the government with his help, but when would it have been thought? On May 19, 2014, when Nitish Kumar resigned and declared Manjhi as his successor, it was said that now he can be with remote control Will run the government
 nitish ne remote to apane paas rakhaa, lekin bydaree badalanaa bhul gaye
 How many days would the old battery last and now the battery would change only if the Chief Minister allowed it
 jab tak nitish ko ye baat samaj main aati tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 Or say that the bet was almost out of hand
 brake main bhi bane raheaisa nahin he ki maanjhi ko kursi saunp kar nitish chaar dham kii yatra par nikal gaye
 Nitish regularly met legislators
 logon se jude rahane ke liye jab tab kahin na kahin daura bhi karte rahe
 On the other hand, Manjhi kept quietly understanding the nuances of the work
 raajnneeti kaa purana anubhav to unke paas tha hi, bas is tarah kaam karne kii aazaadee pehali baar mili thi
 Manjhi was well aware of the importance of caste politics in Bihar
 maanjhi jaanate the ki jis mahadalit agenda ke bharose nitish ne bihar main apni raajnneetik pakad majboot kii vah khud bhi usee tabake se aate hai
 Perhaps then he realized that it is better to hold the gun on his own than to shoulder the gun
 maanjhi ke paas kursi or kalam to thi hi unhone nitish ke haath se mahadalit formule se las bandook bhi lapak lee
 After this, he went out hunting hunting
 mahadalit mukhyamantri kaa pasamanjhi shaayad loha garm hone kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 As soon as the opportunity came, a political move took place
 bhari mehfil main maanjhi ne elaan kar diya ki vah sanyas lenaa chaahate hai
 There is just one last political wish - the next chief minister should be a Mahadalit
 ye bhi tir nishane par laga
 Manjhi began to emerge as the real messiah of the Mahadalits
 naukarshahi par nishanamanjhi ne nitish kumaar ke sabase chahete afasar ko target kiya jise na to koi netaa or na hi uske saathi afasar pasand karte the
 If he liked someone, then Nitish had a remote but the battery was discharged
 maanjhi ne us afasar ko saste main chalata kar diya
 Manjhi also supervised some more officers
 iske liye unhone apane bharosemand afasaron ko jagah jagah tainaat kiya
 Manjhi knew that the most that anyone can trust in Bihar is his own community
 unhone aise afasaron ko chun chun kar ahm padon par set kar diya
 Now after the ministerial officers on the target, Manjhi also short-listed some of the ministers in his government who are considered to be Nitish's men
 maanjhi kii najar main lallan singh, pike shahi, shyaam rajak or shravan kumaar kaam to unke saath karte hai magar nitish ke zyada kareeb lagate hai
 It is believed that Manjhi, like the officers, is trying to show the way to such ministers
 bataao to, netaa koun?maanjhi kii hi tarah unke samarthak bhi baagi tevar apanaae hue hai
 In view of Manjhi's growing stature, mlas have also started making rhetoric
 sanvaidhanik prakriya kaa hawala dete hue ve kah rahe hai ki mukhyamantri ke alaava party adhyaksh yaa koi or vidhayak dal kii baithak bhala bula kaise saktaa he
 Nitish supporters have their own arguments
 unka kahana he ki khud maanjhi koun se vidhayakon dwaara chune netaa hai
 He was nominated by Nitish Kumar and he became the Chief Minister
 phir wo kis munh se aisi baaten kar rahe hai
 Post-break meetings: The round of meetings in Bihar continues
 ek saath itani baithken nitish ke satta se brake lene ke baad pehali baar ho rahi hai
 Manjhi with his supporters, while Nitish is preparing a strategy with his supporters
 nitish ke saath jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav kaa saport he to unke political partner lalu prasad ne bhi hari jhandi dikhaa di he
 However, behind the scenes, they are also creating air in favor of Manjhi, there is a discussion
 samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav bhi phone kar nitish ko kursi sanbhaalane kii salaah de chuke hai, vahiin bijepi se haath mila chuke lok janashakti party netaa ram vilaas paswan maanjhi kii awaz ko buland karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar for discharged battery-operated remote is unable to understand how to deal with his Bhasmasur now? Sometimes it seems that all these activities are going on in Gokuldham Society and not in Patna
 tarak mehta ke ulte chashme se to philhal yahi najar aata he

 Dr
 S

 bharat main america ke rajdoot rah chuke frank ji, visnar ke saath ek interective satr main videshmantri subrahmanyam jaishankar ne kaha, "hamen 2016 kaa tajurba yaad tha, jab ek swayambhu aatankwaadi burhan vaani maaraa gaya tha, or uske baad hinsa bhadak uthi thi
 
 
 Our intention (after the abolition of Article 370) was to keep the situation under control while not allowing loss of life, hence restrictions were imposed
 
 
 "videshmantri ne jor dekar kaha, "pichley 30 saal ke dauraan kam se kam 42,000 log maare gaye
 
 
 The fear was that senior police officers were being beaten to death on the streets of Srinagar

 And this was the way to deal with all these problems
 
 
 "dow subrahmanyam jaishankar ne kaha ki ab kshetra main halaat sthir ho chuke hai or bahut-si paabandiyaan hataa lee gai hai, landline or kuch mobile tower bhi behaal kar die gaye hai, tathaa aarthik gatividhiyaan bhi behaal ho gai hai

 yah sebon kii fasal utaare jane kaa samay he
 
 
 Efforts are being made to bring down the apples so that the farmers are not harmed by these changes
 
 
 "unhone yah bhi bataaya ki varsh 1947 main azaadi milane ke baad jammu evam kashmir kis tarah bharat kaa hissaa bana tha, or kis tarah anuchhed 370 astitv main aayaa tha
 The External Affairs Minister said, "the situation in Jammu and Kashmir was strange for a variety of reasons, because it was a border state, and they themselves were being attacked
 
 
 unki ichha thi ki kanoonon ko lagu karne ke lihaaz se unke shesh bharat se judane kii samyavadhi ko badha diya jaae
 
 
 The Constituent Assembly accepted that it was a special case at that time
 
 
 "dow subrahmanyam jaishankar ne bataaya, "iske baad samvidhan ke ekmaatr asthaayee anuchhed ko taiyaar kiya gaya, jise anuchhed 370 kaha gaya
 
 
 At that time it was given the number 306A
 
 
 jab samvidhan ko angikaar kiya gaya, is anuchhed ke antargat raashtrapati kii ore se kai aadesh jari kiye gaye
 
 
 In the last 70 years, 54 such orders have been issued by the President
 
 
 "unhone bataaya, azaadi ke baad shuruaati saalon main raashtrapati kii ore se jaldi-jaldi aadesh jari kiye gaye the, or kashmir main dar or algaavvaad kaa maahaul tha
 The External Affairs Minister said, "if we compare with the rest of India, there were no economic activities in Jammu and Kashmir
 
 
 naukariyon ke kam avasar the, or bahari hone or algaavvaad kaa bhav zyaada tha, or isi vajah se seemaa paar se aatankwaad kaa maahaul tha
 
 
 This state was less connected to India socio-economic
 
 
 bharat ke 100 se zyaada pragatisheel kanoon kashmir par lagu nahin hote the
 
 
 "s
 jaishankar ke anusaar, samvidhan kaa is asthaayee praavdhaan se 'kuch chuninda abhijatya logon ko anuchhed 370 kaa istemaal karte hue rajnatik takat par ekadhikaar sthapit karne' kaa mauka mila
 He said, "their vested interests were hidden behind keeping the separatist spirit alive
" 
 
 aapke saamne ve halaat bhi aae the, jab algaavvaadi rajnatik dal pakistan se sanchalit kiye ja rahe aatankwaadi guton ke saath khuleam jude dikhte the

 haal hi main samsung ne flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ ko launch kiya tha
 Before the launch of these smartphones, it was reported that the company could take down the Galaxy S8 + with a dual camera setup
 lekin aisa nahin hua tha
 Now that both the smartphones have been launched and are going to go on sale from April 21, the news is coming that Samsung is testing for dual camera setup in Galaxy S8 +
 Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus ke ye hai sabase khaas fitures or spacificatioinis microbloging website vibo par ek samsunggalexi S8+ kii dual camera sempke saath vaali tasviir dekhi gai he
 It is believed to be an early prototype before launch
 is tasviir main ek capsule ke jaise modul ke andar do camere najar aa rahe hai, uske neeche ek sensor or ek flash bhi dikhaai de rahaa he
 It is reported that the model number of this prototype of Galaxy S8 + also matches the model number of Galaxy S8 +
 jo ki SMG955F bataaya ja rahaa he
 Also interesting thing is that fingerprint is also not visible in its back, so if the company ever launches this prototype, then the fingerprint sensor can be given in the display
 samsung kaa nayaa Galaxy S8 wo kar saktaa he jo iphone bhi nahin kar sakataayaha par ye bhi bataanaa jaruri he ki samsung jaisi badi smartphone companiyaan bahut saare prototip ko test karne ke baad hi ek dizin final karti hai
 However, looking at the picture, it is too early to say anything about its launch
 agar samsung kaa launch karti he bhi he to usase pehle company zaruraifhone 8ke launch hone kaa zarur intjaar karegi

 8 o'clock at night
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki raat baarah baje se 500 or hazaar rupye ke note kagaz kaa tukdaa ho jaaenge, yani legal tender nahin rahenge
 This decision created a stampede across the country, everyone standing in line for hours in front of the atm-bank
 is bich sarkaar ne bazaar main 2000 rupye kaa nayaa gulabi note nikaala, jis par kaaphi charchaa or bahes hui
 Now exactly 526 days later, the situation is again the same
 jo gulabi note aayaa tha ab vah puri tarah se gaayab hone kii kagaar par he
 There is again an outcry in the country about cash
 atm, bank har jagah log cash ke liye dar-dar bhatak rahe hai
 The ATM is empty and because of that people also have pockets
 lekin in 526 dinon main aisa kya ho gaya ki 2000 kaa gulabi note aayaa or phir isaki itani killat shuru ho gai
 And the missing pink note
 
 
 # 8 november 2016 ko notebandi ke elaan ke baad 2000 kaa gulabi note aayaa
 # These notes were issued by the government arguing for a strong economy
 lekin badi maatra main jo note bazaar main jari kiye gaye the, wo waapas bank tak nahin pahunch rahe the
 There were reports of hoarding of these notes continuously
 # yahi kaaran rahaa ki pichley saal 2017 ke madhya se hi sarkaar ne 2000 ke noton kii chapai band kar di thi
 # 6 according to statistics currently in the market
 7 lakh karod mulya ke 2000 ke note cirkulation main hai
 This total 18 issued in circulation
 04 lakh karod mulya ke noton kaa ek tihaai hissaa he
 Read this: Are the atms emptying out of fear of the Modi government's FRDI bill? What is the government doing now? 
 
 # cash kii kami kii shikaayat ke baad sarkaar puri tarah se harakat main ai he
 Efforts are being made by the government to print 100, 200 and 500 rupee notes as much as possible
 # sarkaar kii maane to pehle kareeb 500 karod rupye keemat ke 500 ke note chaape ja rahe the, lekin ab koshish he ki 2500 karod rupye tak kii chapai kii jaaegi
 # The government has argued behind the tightness that there is usually a demand of Rs 20,000 crore cash in a month, but in the first 13 days of April, Rs 45,000 crore was withdrawn
 notebandi part 2: kya ulta padaa 2000 kii note chapai band karne kaa faisla?8 fisadi atm khaali, in rajyon main badha sankatjankaree ke mutabik is samay desh bhar main saare atm main se aath fisadi atm main cash nahin he
 At present, 25 percent of the total atms in the country are with State Bank of India and 16 percent of its atms do not have any money
 sabase zyada uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, bihar, jharkhand, gujarat ke bainkon or atm main cash kii dikkat saamne aa rahi he or ab kaha ja rahaa he ki dilli, gajiabad, noida or gudgaanv bhi isaki chapet main aa sakate hai

 saath hi unhone congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the Central Government launched 129 schemes in five years
 main 129 yojanaon kaa hisaab kitaab lekar daman div kii janata ke bich aayaa hum
 PM Modi is still working for the poor, downtrodden and backward of the country
 yah isliye ho rahaa he kyonki piem modi ke parivaar ke log pichhali sarkaar main nahin rahe hai
 Shah said that the last 4
 5 saal main modi sarkaar ne desh ke har kshetra main kaam karne kaa kaam kiya he
 We have done the work to ensure the security of the country and to increase the pride of the country
 varshon tak desh main congress kii sarkarein chali lekin unhone desh ke garibon ke swasthya kii kabhi chintaa nahin kii, modi sarkaar ne desh ke 50 karod logon ko swasthya kii suraksha di he
 He said that we have done the work to ensure the security of the country and to increase the pride of the country
 hamaare liye bharat mata kii suraksha sabase badi praathamikta he, uske baad hamaare liye chunaav jeetna aata he
 The Congress party, which has been scamming one after the other in the country, is accusing us today, but the people of the country know that they are not going to be misled by the Congress
 shah ne kaha, '12 lakh karod ke ghotaale congress party ne kiye or wo congress aaj modi ji par aarope laga rahi he

 Aam Aadmi Party MLA and Delhi State Secretary Saurabh Bhardwaj said that about 54000 rupees is given as total salary and allowance to an MLA and the cost of any MLA is more than that of salary and allowance

 Saurabh was asked whether this would not send the message to the public that the Aam Aadmi Party and the Delhi government were distributing the money of the public to their people by increasing the salary allowance of the legislators after increasing the budget of the first publicity from 24 crores to 526 crores? So Saurabh said that i think it should be debated, not necessarily only increase salary allowance is the only solution

 pavitra nagari ayodhya main 60 guna 40 varg foot jameen ke ek bahut chote-se tukade kii milkiyat ke daawey ko lekar chali lambii ladaai par bahuvratikshit faisla to agle maah adaalat ke ek kamare main suna diya jayega, lekin usase uthne vaali tarangon se samooche desh ke rajnatik maahaul main jabadast garmi paidaa ho jane kaa andeshaa he
 And this situation is going to happen at a time when the country is already ablaze with Naxalism in a dozen states and terrorism in Kashmir
 yah ladaai lard rahe donon pakshon hinduon or musalamaanon ke liye uttar pradesh ke faijabad jile main sthit jameen ke is chote-se tukade kaa mahatv yah he ki isse unki dharmik bhavanaaen judi hui hai
 Various organizations representing Hindus in the court and in the movements claim that it is the birthplace of Lord Rama, while Muslims say that it is a 16th-century Babri mosque, built by the first Mughal emperor Babur
 26 july ko elahabaad hycourt kii lakhanu peeth main teen nyaayadhishon-nyaayamurti es
 U
 khan, nyaayamurti sudhir agarwal or nyaayamurti di
 U
 sharma-kii peeth ne yah sanket diya ki donon pakshon kii sunwaayee puri ho chuki he or is maamle main faisla sitambar maah main suna diya jayega
 In view of the explosive nature of the Ayodhya dispute, not only the rival organizations - the Babri Masjid Action Committee and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board on behalf of the Muslims and the Nirmohi Arena on behalf of the Hindus and the entire Sangh Parivar, especially the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) - react to this decision The Chief Minister Mayawati has also been attentive to the government machinery
 iske tahat police karmiyon kii sarkari chhuttiyaan agle aadesh tak radd kar hi di gai hai
 Not only this, the government has appointed senior officers by appointing special police officers to monitor law and order in various districts
 rajya sarkaar ne sthiti se nibatane ke liye centre se ardhsainik balon kii koi 500 companiyaan bhejne ke liye bhi kaha he
 Uttar Pradesh's intelligence system is working day and night to monitor the activities of communal elements
 atirikt police mahanideshak str ke ek adhikari ne sweekaar kiya, 'hycourt ke faisle ke pehle or uske dauraan hamen bahut hi chaukanna rahanaa hoga or agar koi sampradayik samasya paidaa karne kaa prayaas kare to turant harakat main aana hoga
 According to this official, the communal situation has become very tense in about half a dozen districts of the state including Varanasi and Bareilly
 sabase mahatvapurn baat to yah he ki kya haarane vaala paksh adaalat ke faisle kaa paalan karegaa
 To this, Neeraj Mishra, a teacher in a small primary school in Faizabad, reacts, 'what happened when the Supreme Court gave its verdict in the Shahbano case? Did not the Muslims then pressurize the then central government to change this decision through Parliament? If the court gave a verdict against the temple, we should do the same
 ' nihsandeh, ayodhya maamla rajnatik rup se dynamite sabit ho saktaa he
 The British too had failed to settle the issue through the court and they thought it good to maintain the status quo
 yahi haal centre or rajya sarkaar kaa hua
 Even with the intervention of Shankaracharya and Muslim Personal Law Board or Syed Shahabuddin, no peaceful solution could be found in the matter
 sthiti gambhir he kyonki jahiraa taur par yah bhale hi dharmik bhaawanaaon kaa maamla lage, lekin hakeekat yah he ki donon paksh apana rajnatik prabhutv sthapit karne ke liye is maamle se laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai
 Considering the old records of both the parties, it would be foolish to think that they will follow the court orders literally
 pichley 20 saal ke dauraan koi aadha darjan pradhanmantriyon, dharmik pramukhon or afasarshahon ne is maamle ko sulajhane ke prayaas kiye honge, lekin isamen ungliyaan jalaane ke baad unhen maamla antat adaalat par chhodana padaa
 Hindu organizations, mainly led by the rss-vhp-bajrang Dal, have also started a mass campaign in this regard
 vihip pravaktaa sharad sharma bataate hai, 'desh ke koi saat lakh mandiron main hanuman chalisa kaa paath shuru ho gaya he
 Its first performance was on 16 August, in which neither the crowd gathered nor did it leave any impact
 isse ayodhya maamle main bhaajapa samet sangh parivaar kii ghatati saakh kii hi jhalak milti he
 The BJP and its allied organizations have failed to fight the case in court with full fervor, not only on the street but also at the legal level
 unhone aise mahatvapurn maamle ko, jo party ko 1991 main pehali baar satta main pahunchane ke liye sanjivani sabit hua tha, mahaj sthaneey vakeelon ke ek samooh ke bharose chhod diya
 On the other hand, his opposition side at one time pushed the top lawyers of the country including Siddharth Shankar Rai in this work
 is maamle main mukhya vaadi nirmohi akhaada ke kuch padaadhikari sangh parivaar par ram mandir nirmaan ke naam par janata se ugaahe gaye karodon ru
 Accuse of belching
 akhaada 1885 se is maamle main lard rahaa he
 The BJP has been trying to stay away from the issue since the disputed structure was demolished in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992
 yahaan tak ki chunaavon ke dauraan usne ayodhya maamle ko thande baste main hi daale rakhaa jisase uske kattar hindu samarthak niraash ho gaye
 The mood of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar is reflected in the deserted workshop of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, where work has been stalled due to 'lack of money'
 teen saal se adhik hue jab yahaan bhagwaan ram ke prastaavit mandir ke liye stambhon ke nirmaan kaa kaam shuru hua tha
 Hardly 65 percent work has been completed in this regard
 desh bhar se umade chale aane vaale rambhakton ne bhi ab yahaan aana-janaa chhod diya he
 Even a few people who come here feel 'cheated' at the hands of Hindu organizations who had made big promises to build a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, but kept it after the ruling in the center
 Were not found ayodhya sthal par swaamitv ke daawey ke mukhya fariyadi hashim ansaari kii ore se mukadmaa lard rahe mushtak siddiki kaa daawa he ki 1885 se lekar 1941 tak nirmohi akhaada likhit rup main yah sweekaar karata rahaa he ki kathith sthal par bana dhaancha babari masjid kaa he or usamen use koi samasya nahin he
 According to him, 'ayodhya case was revived in 1949, when the idols of Lord Rama were secretly kept inside that structure
 'koi 60 varsh se adhik samay se yah mukadmaa lard rahe ansaari kii umr ab 90 saal kii ho chuki he or apane ghar main ve lagbhag akele hi rahete hai
 Pausing a bit, he says, 'the last wish of my life now is to see a mosque in the same place where it was demolished and this will prove that India is a secular country
 ' bahut samay se sunni vakf board adaalat main yah mukadmaa lard rahaa he, jahaan vah kareeb 80 gavaahiyaan pesh kar chukaa he
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has also warned its members and supporters to be vigilant when a decision is taken
 keval sangh parivaar, muslim sanghathan or mayawati sarkaar hi antim ladaai kii taiyaari nahin kar rahe balki mandiron kii nagari ayodhya ke vaasi bhi aagaamee sitambar maheene ke un dinon ko lekar ashankit hai jab adaalat apana aakhri faisla sunayegi
 a senior police officer posted in Ayodhya says, "it is true that the party that loses will knock the door of the Supreme Court to get a stay order on the order of the High Court, but this decision will definitely increase the morale of the winning party
" Will go
 baharhaal, main vijayi paksh kii ore se bhavanaaen bhadakaane or sadakon par jashn manaane ke saath hi 90 vaale dashak kii shuruyaat ke bhayaaspad dinon kii punrariti kii ashankaon ko khaarij nahin karata
 Ayodhya has been plagued for the last 60 years due to this case
 90 vaale dashak main yahaan dange hue or fasaadon main yahaan ke logon ko apane parijanon ko khone ke alaava moolyawaan sampatti se bhi haath dhonaa padaa tha
 And this torture may not end yet for them
 par hashmi is baat se sahamat nahin hai
 He says, 'ayodhya is a secular city, where communal harmony has penetrated deep into people's psyche
 main ram janmabhumi ke anuyaayiyon ke viruddh pichley koi 60 saal se mukadmaa ladata aa rahaa hum, ab meri umr bhi 90 saal kii ho gai he or apane ghar main main akelaa hi rahata hum, lekin kisi hindu ne mujhe ek pathar tak nahin maaraa he
 If we do not let political leaders and communal elements get caught, then Ayodhya will do nothing
 ' koi bhi shaks yah prarthana karne ke sivaa kar hi kya saktaa he ki faisle ke baad bhi ansaari kii baat sach nikle! The government has taken a major step after the terror attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir

 However, in this order of the Jammu and Kashmir administration, Pakistan's pro-separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani is not named
 prashasan ke is faisle ke baad aaj shaam tak pakistan or aatank parast in netaaon ko di gai sari suraksha, sari sarkari suvidhaayen waapas le lee jaaengi
 After this decision of the government, now no separatist leader will be provided any kind of security or facility on government expenses for any reason

 Following this order of the Jammu and Kashmir administration, the vehicles and cars received by them from the state government will be withdrawn
 sarkari sutron ne kaha ki police is baat kii samiksha karegi ki kya in chaar algaavvaadi netaaon ke alaava kisi duusare algaavvaadi netaa ko sarkari suraksha mili he, agar samiksha main aise kisi bhi netaa kaa naam aata he to uski bhi suraksha or sarkari suvidha waapas lee jaaegi
 Explain that after the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in Pulwama, there was a demand to withdraw the security of these separatist leaders across the country
 bharat sarkaar in algaavvaadi netaaon kii suraksha par har saal karodon rupee kharch karti he
 On 15 February, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the security of these leaders will be withdrawn
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir main kuch tatwon kaa iesai or aatanki sanghathanon se naata he, inaki suraksha kii samiksha honi chahie
 Today, following this decision, the government has withdrawn all security from them

 The National Tribal Party Alliance (NTPA) was announced at the Indian Social Institute in Delhi on the evening of 14 October
 yahaan desh ke nau rajyon ke adivasee sanghathan is sammelan main hissaa lene ke liye aae the
 Actually, the purpose of this alliance is to unite and play an active part in the politics of the country
 gondvanaa ganatantr party ke adhyaksh or is sanghathan ke upaadhyaksh hira singh markaam ne kaha, is ekajutata kaa matlab he ki ab adivasee haasiye par rahane kii jagah sidhaa raajnneeti main hastkshep karegaa

 bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ke net neutrelity (nirpekshata) par paraamarsh parache (canceltesan paper) se apni asahmatiyon ko twitor par jari karne kaa faisla maine 8 april ko kiya tha
 After reading the 118-page document titled Regulating Over the Top Services, it was clear that once again the Internet and its crores of consumers were going to pose a dangerous challenge
 maine twit kiya ki upabhoktaaon ko is paraamarsh kii prakriya kaa hissaa banakar apni pratikriya deni chahie taaki unki aawaaj suni ja sake
 Just a week later, the Indian Internet consumer has demonstrated its prowess ‚Äî social media and mainstream media have also come out in support of net neutrality and have questioned trai's perspective on the issue
 net neutrelity aisa buniyadi siddhant he jo yah pakkaa karata he ki sari online saamagree upabhokta ko samaan sharton par uplabdh ho
 Technically speaking, this means that all data packets are treated equally
 yahi tatv internet ko mukt or paraspar sahyogpurn sthaan banaata he jaisaa vah aaj he
 a platform that empowers consumers to freely choose the content of their choice, except those legally prohibited
 isi takat ne aise tamaam aplication or sevaaon ko kaamyaab banane kaa kaam kiya he jinhone upabhoktaaon ke anubhav jagat ko hi badal daalaa he
 Recently, trai's silence was caught when Airtel, India's largest telecom service provider, tried to charge extra for some specific apps
 upabhoktaaon kaa aakrosh saamne aane ke baad is kadam ko waapas liya gaya
 Because of this, i was forced to write to TRAI, in which i requested him to intervene in this misuse of market power
 yah paraamarsh prakriya der se hi sahi, lekin usee kaa nateeja he
 The debate over net neutrality is of no philosophical nature
 ity kanoon kii dhara 66e kii tarah yah bhi mukt or lagaataar badhate rahane vaale internet kii mul aatma se sambandhit he
 In the case of Section 66A, where some leaders wanted to disrupt the expression, in the latest case there are some telecom companies who want to control the dynamics and economics of the Internet
 agar in companiyon kii manamaani chal gai, to upabhoktaaon ko niyamit data shulk ke atirikt watsap, vibar jaise eps kholane ke liye alag se shulk dena padegaa
 The reasons that telecom companies are counting on include the innovations happening on other platforms on their own companies and security reasons which will affect their earnings
 is vajah se ve chaahate hai ki otiti (over da top content) ke liye niamak dhaancha taiyaar ho taaki companiyaan in eps ke liye paisa vasuul saken
 There is no doubt that the telecom business model is relying only on revenue coming from phone calls to companies, but it also cannot be accepted that the economic burden of converting telecom companies into data-centric companies and business models Be put on the shoulder of the consumer
 ajeeb baat he ki jahaan tamaam niveshak is baat ko samajhate hai ki praudyogiki ke kshetra main ho rahe navachaar or badlaav samooche paridrishy ko prabhavit kar rahe hai, vahiin tri main baithe logon ko iskaa andaja tak nahin he
 trai's recommendations are in violation of the principles of net neutrality
 yah aisa tantra banane kii ore lakshith he jahaan vishisht sevaaon or eps tak upabhoktaaon kii pahunch ko doorsanchaar companiyaan apane shulk ke bal par haankane kii takat hasil kar lengi
 Talking about the interest of consumers, TRAI does not have a very glorious past as the level of services of telecom providers has declined under its rule
 yah kadam bhi doorsanchaar companiyon kii taraf hi jhukaa hua lagata he, jisaki kai misaalen di ja sakati hai
 For example, detailed tables are provided on the "adverse effects" on telecom operators' earnings from the spread of OTT services such as Skype
 saarvajanik rup se uplabdh jaankaree kahati he ki doorsanchaar oparator ab bhi baari munafa kaat rahe hai, lihaaja ye talikaayen safed jhooth se zyada kuch nahin hai
 Some of the questions that Trai has raised also reinforce the perception of his partisan attitude, such as "what distinctions are rational from a practical perspective?" It is intended to ask how much illegal activity is allowed in the name of practicality
 aise kai udhaaharan hai jo pehle se hi upabhoktaaon main ghati hui tri tathaa doorsanchaar companiyon kii vishwasaneeyata ko or batta lagaate hai
 This time however, the cry that people have raised is an unprecedented example of consumer power in a country where consumer rights have always been marginalized
 is ghatana main niamak sanstha or nijee companiyon ko sabak lene ke liye bahut kuch maujuud he
 Whatever official aspect of India will decide on net neutrality, it will prove to be decisive in terms of technological impression of India in the coming decades
 tri kii siforishein 24 april ke baad sarkaar ke paas pahunchengi
 There is evidence that the government's approach will not be the same as that of TRAI
 sarkaar ko nirnaayak faisla lenaa hoga
 Investment and investors are important in the telecom sector, but consumers have to be at the center because they are the biggest stakeholders in any debate on the future of the Internet
 kuch mutthi bhar nijee companiyaan internet jaisi ahm cheez ke niyam tay nahin kar saktin
 (the author is a Rajya Sabha MP and a technology entrepreneur) chini tech company Huawei par sankat gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Google has canceled the license of Android from Huawei's smartphone following an order from the US Trump government
 itnaa hi nahin, microsoft ne apane stores se huaave ke laptops hataa liye hai
 The latest news is that Vodafone in the UK has also suspended pre-bookings for Huawei's 5G smartphones
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui he
 According to a Reuters report, UK chip maker ARM has also made preparations to suspend its business with Chinese company Huawei
 aisa america regaullation ko follow karte hue kiya ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that ARM is one of the largest chip designers in the world
 bloomberg kii ek report ke mutabik chip mekars intel, qolkom or broadcom jaisi duniya kii badi chipset companiyon ne apane karmchaariyon se kaha he ki wo agle notice tak huaave ko kai bhi supplai nahin denge
 On Friday, the US Trump government has ordered Huawei to be blacklisted
 aarope ye lagaaya gaya he ki ye chini company china kii sarkaar ke jasoos ke taur par kaam kar rahi he or chini saraakar ke liye spai kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that at this time Huawei has become the second largest smartphone company in the world
 lekin ab google or chipset companiyon dwaara darkinar karne ke baad company ke paas kai mushkilen hai
 Now the company will have to create a mobile operating system with Android made to deliver in its smartphone
 smartfones ke alaava huaave ko 5G diploement main bhi bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Because the company has prepared extensively for 5G and most of the equipment for 5G is supplied by American companies only
 kul mila kar abhi tak ke liye mudda ye he ki lakhon karodon huaave yugers mushkil main honge
 Google's apps will not run and Android support is also likely to stop
 haalanki security apadats milte rahenge, google ne ye saaf kar diya he
 But not getting the support of Google apps will be a big thing for any Android smartphone

 kapildev kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne manoj kumaar ko arjuna aword dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Angered by the government's decision, Manoj Kumar filed a petition in the Delhi High Court
 manoj kumaar ne 2010 ke kaamanwealth games main swarna padak jeeta tha
 Manoj said that he got information in the morning about the decision of the ministry
 unhone kaha, khel mantralay main sanyukt sachiv onkaar kedia ne mere bhai rajesh ko is bare main mangalvaar shaam ko bataaya, lekin mujhe soochna aaj subah hi mili
 Following the controversial nomination of boxer Jai Bhagwan for the Arjuna Award, Manoj was approached by Sports Ministry officials who had assured that his name would be added to the list of awardees after the review meeting
 aisa nahin hone par manoj ne kanoon kii sharan lee or dilli hoicourt main mukadmaa daayar kiya

 Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, on behalf of the Ministry, admitted in the court that the award in Manoj's name was not considered because the committee mistakenly considered him involved in the doping case
 spot phixing maamle main landan kii ek adaalat ne pakistan ke teen cricketron salmaan bat, mohammad asif or mohammad aamir samet buki mazhar majid ko jail kii sajaa sunai
 Salman Butt has been sentenced to 30 months imprisonment, Mohammad Asif 12 months and Mohammed Aamir to 6 months imprisonment while Bookie Mazhar Majeed has been sentenced to 2 years and 8 months imprisonment
 lagbhag teen hafte chali sunwaayee main khilaadiyon ke agent mazhar majid ko sabase kadi sajaa sunaate hue nyaayamurti jeremi cook ne unhen do saal or aath maheene ke liye jail bheja
 Cook told the four sentenced people, "despite the pleas of the concession, these crimes are so severe that a prison sentence would only be appropriate
" ‚Äôapane saathiyon ko bhrasht karne vaale bat ko is puure ghotaale kaa ‚Äòsutaradhar‚Äô kaha gaya
 The episode was revealed by the now-closed tabloid 'news of the World' in August last year through a sting operation
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‚Äòyah saaf he ki tum in maamalon ke sutaradhar ho
 You had to make sure that these two bowlers bowled according to the fix time
 ‚Äôcook ne asif se kaha, ‚Äòtumhaare paas se koi paisa nahin mila lekin yah spasht he ki tumne nobal phenkane ke liye sajeesh rachi
 Butt and Asif were charged by the jury on Tuesday with conspiracy to commit fraud and falsely accepting money
 majid or aamir ne sitambar main sunwaayee se purv hi apana dosha sweekaar kar liya tha
 However, these cricketers may have to spend only half of their time in jail as they can be released on license if treated well
 in teenon cricketron ko saath hi maamle main aaye kharch kaa bhugtan karne ko bhi kaha gaya he
 Butt has been asked to give 30937 pounds while Asif and Aamir have been given 8120 and 9389 pounds respectively
 nyaayadhish cook ne kaha, ‚Äòab jab log match main hairaan karne vaali chijen dekhenge yaa koi hairaani bharaa nateeja aayega yaa kabhi bhavishya main koi hairaani bharaa nateeja aayega, to paise kharch karke match dekhne vaale khel ke prashansak sochenge ki kahin yah match fiks to nahin he yaa jo unhone dekha kya vah swabhavik tha
 'when these three cricketers reached the court, there was a tussle between the media persons and the common men to get room in the room
 spot phixing kaa yah sara prakaran pichley saal agast main shuru hua jab stabdh karne vaali vah footage saamne ai jisamen majid daawa kar rahaa tha ki vah 10 lakh dollars main test match fiks kar saktaa he
 He claimed that Butt, Asif and Aamir worked for him and revealed how the trio deliberately threw Nobel during the Lords Test against England
 police ne sting aaparishan ke baad cricketron ke hotel ke kamaron main chapa maaraa or nakad raashi baraamad kii jiske bare main ye donon koi spasht jawaab nahin de paye
 The ICC, after taking disciplinary action, banned Butt for 10 years (five years suspended), Asif for seven years (suspended two years) and Aamir for five years
 isse pehle hue match phixing maamalon main hansee kronye, saleem malik or mohammad ajaharuddin jaise nami cricketer ko vibhinn nyaayik aayogon ne doshi paaya lekin kisi bhi cricketer ko ab tak aapraadhik sajaa nahin sunai gai thi
 The only case to sentence players to cheating in a UK court came up in 1964 when three footballers were sentenced to prison for losing matches
 sajaa sunaaye jane ke dauraan abhiyog paksh ke vakil aftab jafarji kusi ne kaha ki bat or asif ne laalach se prerit hokar ek match ko ‚Äòdooshit‚Äô kiya jise lakhon logon ne dekha or apni team, pakistan cricket board or khel ko ‚Äòdhokhaa‚Äô diya

 On this issue, the first Congress President Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack on PM Modi and Anil Ambani, in response to which the Union Law Minister Ravishankar Prasad was fielded by the government
 is dauraan unhone rahul gandhi par palatwaar kiya or rafel kii jaankaree saarvajanik karwaakar pakistan kii madad karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 After this, the Congress again retaliated and took the front of the Surdeep Surjewalene Congress
 ravishankar ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue surajevaala ne kaha, 'rafel ko lekar rahul gandhi ke sawaalon par piem modi to chup hai, lekin raksha mantralay or kanoon mantri bayaan de rahe hai
 Law Minister is talking illegal
 wo ahankaar main duube hue hai
 He has been a lawyer for Reliance
 is maamle main rakshaamantri bhi saamne nahin aa rahi hai
 During this time, he challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Ravi Shankar Prasad to make the documents of Korafel deal public

 'congress netaa ne kaha, 'yah bhi sach he kirafel dilafrance ke raashtrapati oland or hindustan ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bich hua tha
 When Hollande's statement on this deal came to light, either the French government, the Indian government and PM Modi denied it
 isse saaf he ki oland kii baat sach he
 No one could challenge his statement
 yahaan tak kanoon mantri bhi unke bayaan ko nahin kaat paae
 Earlier, reversing Rahul Gandhi's statement, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Congress President wants to help Pakistan by making all the information of Rafael public
 prasad ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi desh ke lokapriy netaa or eemaandaaree ke pratik pradhanmantri modi ko chor kaha he
 Till date in India, the national president of a party has not used such words for any prime minister
 rahul gandhi bina kisi gun or kaabiliyat ke sirf isliye congress adhyaksh bane hai ki wo gandhi parivaar se aate hai
 Therefore, no more can be expected from them
 rahul gandhi par palatwaar karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'jo vyakti bhrashtachar, jameen or share kii lut main apni mata ke saath bel par baahar ho, jo apane bahanoi ke dwaara jameen luutane par khamosh rahe or jiske puure parivaar ne boforce main ghoose lee ho, usase desh koi apeksha nahin kar saktaa
 The Congress party is the mother of corruption
 congress adhyaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hueravishankar prasadne kaha, 'wo ye kah rahe hai ki rafel kaa daam bataa do, taaki dushman chaukanna ho jaae
 They want to help Pakistan by making all the information of Rafale public

 Ramlila could not be held on the grand stage in Old Delhi's Red Fort ground due to the heavy rains
 khule aasmaan ke neeche bane bhavy manch, liting, sound system, elidi lits, logon ke baithne ke liye kursiyaan bhig jane se ek chote tent ke bheetar hi ramlila kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 Actually, Ramlila of Old Delhi attracts people because of its artist and the effect it creates due to the electronic device on the stage
 lekin achaanak baras rahi barish ne aayojan karne waalon ke saath saath aam logon ko bhi niraash kar diya he
 The incessant rains have filled mud and water on all the roads leading up to the stage
 kamity se jude log pani se bhig chuke manch ko thik karne main jute gaye hai
 Dinesh of love-kusharamlilakmiti says that efforts are being made to save the rain-soaked items
 barish kii vajah se manch kaa zyaadaatar saamaan geela ho gaya he, jisase hataane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Dinesh is praying to God not to rain so that Ramlila can be started soon
 barish se sirf bhavy manch kiramlilahi nahin balki maidan par lagane vaale meley ko bhi baari nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 The fair was closed on Friday due to the large swing and small shops filled with water here
 dukandaaron ne bataaya ki bijli se chalane vaale jhulon ko barish ke bich istemaal karnaa behad mushkil hota he
 Due to the rains, water has filled up with swings as well as shops ranging from common paths and toys

 Due to the weekend, not only Delhiites, but couples from nearby states were also seen enjoying the pleasant weather
 pichley dinon umas or garmi se halkaan logon ko badi raahat mil rahi he
 According to the Meteorological Department, black clouds will dominate the weekend and strong rains may occur in many areas
 saal main ek baar puure bhartiya upmahadweep main chamatkaar hota he
 The waters of the Indian Ocean come riding in the warm winds of June and soak up the dry earth and bring greenery to life
 ek achche atithi kii tarah sitambar ke aakhir main yah vidaa le letaa he
 This guest monsoon is an important part of the global air and hydrological system but remains an unsolved mystery for scientists around the world
 hajaaron saal se, puure upmahadweep main arabon kii aabaadi monsoon kii lay ke saath kadamtal karti he, lekin ab yah ridm tuutata najar aa rahaa he
 At present, 49 percent of the districts in the country are prone to drought and heavy rains have caused havoc in 25 percent of the districts
 kai jagah kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar 100 millimetre se zyada barish ho gai
 In Mumbai, on 29-30 August, in just 9 hours, 304 mm of heavy rain caused such water and water that the flood of 26 July 2005 was remembered
 isi tarah ausat se kam hui barsaat se sookhe pade chandigarh main 21 agast ko achaanak badal fat pade or mahaj 3 ghanton main 115 mimi barish ho gai
 In Chandigarh, 15 per cent of the year's average rain fell in just three hours
 aise hi bengaluru main lambey sookhe mausam ke baad 15-16 agast din bhar main 150 mimi barsaat ho gai
 This is about 30 per cent of the annual rainfall in Bengaluru
 hairat nahin, bengaluru main sab kuch ast-vyast ho gaya
 In the Northeast or Bihar, floods are part of the seasonal tradition
 is baar ajeeb yah he ki in ilaakon main barish ausat se kam hui he phir bhi baadh afat kii tarah pasar gai he
 Not only this, there was also a severe outbreak of floods in less rainy areas of Gujarat, especially Saurashtra and western Rajasthan
 phir bhi, mausam vibhaag ke mutabik, 28 agast tak deshbhar main 693 mimi barish honi chahie thi, lekin barish 661 mimi hi hui he
 This is 5 percent less than the average
 hakeekat yah bhi he ki agast ke pehle pakhwaade tak desh main atyadhik baari barsaat (yani 24 ghante main 244 mimi se adhik) kii 20 ghatnaayen or baari barsaat (yani 124-244 mimi barish) kii 100 ghatnaayen hui hai
 Meaning clearly, the mood of the monsoon did not go well this year
 nai dilli main bhartiya mausam vibhaag ke varisht vaigyanik dow
 Charan Singh says, "the mood of the monsoon is not measured on the basis of one or two years of rain
 iskeliye kai dashakon ke aankadon kaa ausat dekha jaataa he
 It is too early to talk about change in monsoon
 is baar barish ne sthaneey kaarnon se alag kism kaa bartaav kiya he
 "how is this different treatment?" If the monsoon is normal, a cyclone-like situation occurs in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal in the beginning of June, moving towards northwest India
 iske raste main odisha, chhattisgarh, vidarbha, madhya pradesh, gujarat or rajasthan aata tha (graphics dekhen)
 Over the past few years, the monsoon has changed its course slightly
 mausam kaa purvanumaan lagane vaali agency scymet ke upaadhyaksh mahesh ravat kehete hai, ''pichley 6-7 saal se monsoon ke saamaanya pattern main vichlan aayaa he
 Now the low pressure area has started to form in the middle of the Bay of Bengal
 isse uskaa saamaanya rasta madhya bharat main thodaa dakshin kii ore yani odisha ke dakshini hisse, chhattisgarh, vidarbha, dakshini madhya pradesh or rajasthan kii ore khisak gaya he
 "confirms Rawat's talk
 a 2014 study by Pune's Savitribai Phule University pointed to a change in rainfall patterns since 1951 across the country
" iske mutabik, monsoon sijan main barsaat kii maatra main kshetreey taur par aniyamitata kii baat sthapit hoti he or kuccha samet gujarat or pashchimi bharat main musaladhar barish kii ghatnaayen badi he
 This is happening more in areas with more urbanization
 misaal ke taur par, rajasthan ke mount abu main mahaj teen din main sijan kii 50 fisadi barsaat ho gai or barish kaa aankada 1,715 mimi tak pahunch gaya
 Mahesh Rawat says, "this time two continuously low pressure areas were formed in the Bay of Bengal
 vah nae raste se sidhe gujarat pahunche or use arab sagar se bhi nami hasil ho gai, gujarat par deep depressant banane se badal kai din tak vahaan ruk gaye
 This caused heavy and very heavy rainfall
 '' ravat bataate hai ki pehle vaale badal ke kamjor padate hi duusare kam dabaav se bane badal bhi aa dhamke or is mausami ghatana se lagaataar das dinon tak badal barasate rahe
 As a result, Gujarat and western Rajasthan experienced heavy floods due to above average rainfall
 asal main, yah monsoon kaa ajeebogareeb vyavhaar hi tha, kyonki saamaanya taur par bengal kii khadi main banane vaale kam dabaav agar andruni samudri kshetra main banate hai to chakravaat banakar amuman odisha, bengal yaa phir myanmar kii taraf mud jate hai
 This time both cyclones turned west and got stuck in the sky of Gujarat and Rajasthan
 monsoon ne iske baad bhi chaal badali or vahaan se uttar kii taraf bad gaya or himalayan tarai ke ilaakon, jammu-kashmir, uttarakhand se lekar assam or arunachal tak fail gaya
 The southern part of such seasonal condition remains dry which is called the break monsoon situation
 is baar bhi is brake kii vajah se pashchimottar bharat main kai dinon tak barish nahin hui
 On the other hand, the monsoon rains in the lowland areas of Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura led to floods in Assam
 dow
 Charan Singh says that these four small states have average rainfall but this time there was heavy rains, the Brahmaputra coming from China was also erupting
 aise main assam main baadh aa gai
 You will remember, till a decade and a half ago, the rain used to be slow and many days, but now the number of days of torrential rain has increased
 kuch hi ghanton main hone vaali dharasar barsaat tabaahi laati he
 Mahesh Rawat says, "now more rain is coming in the form of thunder showers i
e
 thunder clouds
 1 june se 30 sitambar ke bich jo 890 mimi kii monsooni barsaat honi chahie, kamobesh utani hi ho rahi he, lekin barish ke din kam ho gaye hai
 The reason is climate change, lack of greenery and increasing pollution
 yah saare kaarak monsoon par asar daal rahe hai
 a study done in 2015 by the IPCC (panel of governments of various countries on climate change) on the mood of the monsoon explains this in detail
 iske mutabik, kisi jagah kii dharaatal kii garmi ko vahaan kii jameen kaa istemaal bhi badha detaa he or vah barsaat ke prakaar par asar daalati he
 The mode of use of the ground and the dust and pollution in the air (aerosols) also affect the amount of heat returned (albido) from the earth
 zyada airosol kii maujuudagi se hawa zyada garam ho jaati he
 Consequently, the clouds that should spread far and wide rise with warm air and turn into thunder clouds
 isse ek hi jagah adhik barish hoti he
 The IPCC study has reported this changed pattern of rainfall from 5 to 15 percent
 in ghatnaon se monsoon ke aagaman kii tithiyon main bhi herpher hone laga he
 The thundering clouds that Rawat mentions first preceded the monsoon in March, April, and May with storms called 'norster' in northern India or 'kalbaishakhi' in Bengal
 lekin ab jaise hi bharat main mukhyabhumi ke upar kii hawa garm hoti he, or nami banati he to garajane vaale badal ban jate hai
 These are only about 3 thousand feet from the surface of the earth, but its upper end goes up to 50 thousand feet
 in badalon main agar gati hui to sau-do sau kilometre ke daayre main acchhee barsaat hoti he lekin tarai kaa ilaaka ho to badal zyada duuri tay nahin kar sakate or phir us ilaake main ghanghor barsaat hoti he
 There is an opinion from global studies to meteorologists that this unusual monsoon pattern is New Normal and we should try to adapt to the new environment
 baadh prabhavit ilaakon ke saath hi mumbai, chennai, bengaluru yaa chandigarh jaise shaharon main aisi aapadaa ke prabandhan kii taiyaari zyada durust or twarit kiya janaa hi ekmaatr upaay he

 (input bhashaa se) Indian batsman Virat Kohli, who scored the most runs in one-day international cricket in the year 2013, missed out on a century by only one run in the second ODI of the series against the West Indies and thus he was on 99 in one-day international cricket

 viraat kohli ko apane kariyar ke 18wein or vishakhapatnam main lagaataar tisare shatak ke liye sirf ek ran kii jarurat thi, or unhone ravi rampal kii gend par fine leg par kaich thama diya
 In this way, he joined the list of 21 batsmen who have been dismissed for 99 runs in one-day cricket

 Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar, who recently retired from Test cricket, was dismissed for 99 three times in the year 2007
 unke alaava srilanka ke sanath jayasoorya bhi do baar ek ran se shatak se chuke hai
 The first batsman to be dismissed for 99 by India was Krishmachari Srikkanth, who was playing against England in Cuttack in 1984

 haalanki kuch der ke baad ashleel twit or unki idi or password hataa liya gaya, lekin ek twit abhi bhi he
 It contains the email ID of the hacker group and has been asked to contact it

 According to the website, it is designed to help journalists and activists avoid the surveillance on the Internet
 is website par yah bhi likhaa he ki agar is ypi adress se koi ashleel massej bheje jate hai, to die gaye email idi par sampark kar sakate hai
 Let us tell you that many such hacker groups are active around the world, who hack people's email ids so that they can be told how to strengthen it through cyber security
 fasebuk founder mark jakarberg or google ke mukhiya sundar pichaai kacount ko hecokarke bhi aisa hi likhaa gaya tha

 This case is related to the Atal Ayushman Scheme
 is ghotaale main lipt do bade aspataalon ke khilaaf police ek exiaar darj kar rahi he
 This FIR has also become a headache for the police
 hindi or angreji main bheji gai yah exiaar likhane main police ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 Actually, the police FIR typing software does not have a capacity of more than 10 thousand words, that is why the police is writing this FIR by hand writing

 Of this, one Tahrir is 64 pages, and the other Tahrir is about 24 pages
 tahariron main adhik vivaran hone ke kaaran in aspataal sanchaalkon ke khilaaf online exiaar darj nahin ho sakati
 In Kotwali, the capacity of the FIR registering software is not more than 10 thousand words, due to which the sweat of the police is missing
 exiaar darj karne main deree ko lekar ek varisht police adhikari ne 2 din main exiaar likh kar purna karne kii chetavanee di he
 The trouble is not limited to writing in this FIR

 The first challenge for the police is to register it and then explain it, both are not easy

 The SI has also registered a case against the accused girl and her three associates Sanjay Singh, Vikram Singh and Sachin Sengar, in the charge of blackmailing Chinmayananda for a ransom of Rs 5 crore

 Taking a dig at the RJD supremo at a press conference, the senior BJP leader said, "lalu Prasad performs co-operation (cooperation) with Congress in Delhi, operations (campaign against) in Patna and in-between separation (isolation) Let's pretend ‚Äô unhone kaha ki jab-jab samprag sarkaar par sankat aata he to lalu prasad or mulaayam singh yadav sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye aage aate hai
 Sometimes BSP supremo Mayawati also comes forward
 congress sibiai, iskar vibhaag, aatankwaad nirodhak dal (aties) or rajyapal jaise sadhano se kaam leti he
 Naidu said that the Congress adopts the formula of Three d-divers, Defame and Distabilize and we will answer it with our defit (defeated)
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha, ‚Äòcongress ayodhya, gujarat ke muddon se logon ko gumraah karti he
 Adopts a formula to discredit the non-congress government
 pehle gujarat main narendra modi ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii or karnataka main bies yediurppa ke baad ab ve nitish kumaar ko badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Naidu said, "we defeated the Congress badly in Gujarat and it's our turn to lose in Bihar today
" ‚Äô unhone tukbandi karte hue rochak dhang se kaha ki bihar se congress kaa patta saaf ho jayega or lalu ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 It does not have any message
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki lalu prasad or ramvilas paswan hameshaa jaatpaat or majahab kii raajnneeti karte rahe hai, lekin log is baar vikaas ke naam par rajg ko vijayi banaayenge

 uttar pradesh (uttar Pradesh) ke bulandshahr (bulandshahr) main mivati (mayawati) ke ek samarthak ne guuruuvaar ko vot dene ke baad apni anguli kaat lee
 In fact, the supporter had voted for the BJP by 'mistake' during voting
 is baat se samarthak itnaa niraash ho gaya ki usne apni anguli hi kaat daali
 Bahujan Samaj Party (bahujan Samaj party-bsp) supporter is named Pawan Kumar
 news agency eenai se baat karte hue pawan ne kaha, "maine hathi ke bajaae galati se camel ke nishaan vaala batan dabaa diya tha

 madhya pradesh chunaav ke liye bhartiya janata party ne aaj apana ghoshnaptr jari kar diya
 Today, in the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Bhopal, BJP has issued a vision and like the Congress has played a 'cow' to win votes
 madhya pradesh main chauthi baar satta main vaapasi kii koshish kar rahi bijepi ne janata se vaadon kii jhadi laga di he lekin is sab ke bich jis chiz ne congress ke ghoshnaptr kii yaaden tazaa kar di wo he gaay or gaushala
 The BJP in its manifesto has promised to increase the number of cowsheds and open cow sanctuaries in every division
 haalanki ye baat alag he ki bijepi kaa ghoshnaptr jari karne aaye arun jetali is baat se anjaan dikhe or unhone khud mana ki kuch mudde ghoshnaptr ke liye nahin hote
 When Arun Jaitley was asked this question, he said that the subject of cow moves beyond the manifesto
 apane agenda ko bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main dekh congress bhi maidan main kud padi
 The Congress alleged that before opening a new cow sanctuary, it would have taken care of the only cow sanctuary in the country
 congress ne bijepi ke drushtiptr ko drushtiviheen bataaya he
 Congress state president Kamal Nath tweeted bjp's manifesto as false
 kamalnath ne likhaa ki 'bhaajapa kaa aaj jari drushti patr dhokhaa va chhalaava maatr he, kuch nayaa nahin puraani ghoshnaaon ko hi dobaaraa shaamil kiya gaya he
 The words of the old manifesto are incomplete till date
 nayi ghoshnaaon se gumraah kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The BJP did not look at the manifesto of the year 2003, the year 2008, the year 2013
 uski kai ghoshnaaon ko aaj tak puraa nahin kiya
 Before this vision letter, the BJP had to discuss the incomplete declarations of the old manifesto
 is ghoshnaa patr se congress ke is aarope kii pushti ki bhavantar yojana kisaan virdohi he, bhaajapa khud ko is yojana par bharosa nahin he
 That is why the farmers are being misled in the name of new announcements
 aapako bataa den ki beete hafte congress ne bhi apane ghoshnaptr main gaushala badhaane kaa vaada kiya tha or jis tarah se ab bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main iskaa zikr hua he usase lagata he ki logon se jude muddon kii jagah ab gaay, gaushala or dharm ne le lee he

 Among them, the most popular name is that of BJP President Amit Shah, who won by heavy votes from Gandhi Nagar
 amit shah ko koi pramukh mantralay mil saktaa he, to kai anya mantriyon ko unke kaam kaa inaam dete hue tarakkee ho sakati he
 Business Standard has quoted sources as saying that Shah, who first reached the Lok Sabha, may join the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs (CCS) in the second term of the Modi government
 gauratlab he ki sisies main piem ke alaava raksha, grih, videsh or vitt vibhaag ke chaar sheersh mantri shaamil hote hai
 That is, Shah can become one of these ministers
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main narendra modi ke siem rahane ke dauraan amit shah unki sarkaar main grih mantri rah chuke hai
 Hence it is also discussed that Amit Shah can be made the Home Minister in the Central Government
 lekin modi kii pehali sarkaar main grih mantri rahe rajnath singh is baar bhi lakhanu se jite hai or party ke sabase varisht netaaon main se hai
 Goyal will be promoted! It also seems that Nirmala Sitharaman, who successfully took over the ministry amid allegations of scandal on Rafael, will get the defense ministry again
 duusari taraf, sarkaar ke liye sankatmochak kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale rail mantri piyush goyal ko is baar zyada mahatvapurn mantralay mil saktaa he
 Arun Jaitley's health concerns On the other hand, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is worried about his health
 unhen guuruuvaar ko hi dilli ke ames se discharge kiya gaya he or vah bijepi mukhyalay par hone vaale vijay utsav main shaamil nahin ho sake
 Considering the economic challenges that will come in the following months, the party is worried whether he can handle the Finance Ministry on such an occasion given his health? Jaitley was not going to office for almost three weeks
 vah modi sarkaar ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal main zyaadaatar samay vitt mantri rahe
 He was unable to present the final budget of the Modi government due to a critical surgery in the US on 22 January this year and Piyush Goyal was given this responsibility

 They can get its reward
 iske alaava wike singh ko bhi pramukh mantralay dena majaburi hogi kyonki vah gajiabad se duusari baar baari maton se jite hai
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is also reaching the Lok Sabha for the first time after being a Rajya Sabha member for years
 vah pehle bhi pramukh mantralay sambhaal chuke hai or is baar bhi unhen koi mahatvapurn mantralay mil saktaa he

 Let me tell you that whatsapp Pay was to be launched by March but since the facebook-cambridge Analytica scandal it is in balance and the reason behind this is the order given by the Reserve Bank of India for data storage

 According to the report, like other UPI applications, bankers believe that whatsapp does not accept to factor authentication
 kuch aisi hi baat petm ke siio vijay shekhar sharma ne tab kahi thi jab watsap pe kaa beta varjan aayaa tha
 Another localization behind the introduction of whatsapp is data localization

 The question of when the dispute over the land called the ram-janmabhoomi in Ayodhya will cease and the construction of the temple will begin, is still unanswered, but the work of carving and carving the stones for planting in the temple has been going on since the year 1990
 vishwa hindu parishad (vihip)in pattharon par abhi tak lagbhag 10 karod rupee kharch kar chuki he, 65 fisadi kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 The work of carving stones for the Ram temple began here on October 30, 1990
 shuruyaat main sirf chaar kaarigaron ko is kaam main lagaaya gaya tha, baad main kaarigaron kii sankhya badhaai gai
 VHP spokesperson in Ayodhya, Sharad Sharma said, ‚Äúsince the year 1990, the work of carving stones in the workshop has been going on
 is kaam main kabhi baadha nahin ai
 The work of carving 65 percent of the stones for the construction of Ram temple has been completed
 'bakaul sharma, 'varsh 1992 tak pattharon ko taraashne kaa kaam tej kar diya gaya
 Earlier only four artisans were working in it, but later their number was increased to 40

 bharat-pakistan ke bich kashmir ek talkh masalaa rahaa he or kai baar yah masalaa yuddh kaa kaaran banate banate rahaa he
 But now the situation is looking different
 ab pakistan apni desh ke andar hi vipareet paristhitiyon se jujh rahaa he or aise main vahaan ke pradhanmantri bhi yah sweekaar rahe hai ki aisi paristhitiyon main pakistan koi yuddh nahin bardaasht kar saktaa

 We all saw the twist of the courts on Wednesday
 pehle seshans court kaa faisla
 
 salmaan ko paanch saal kii sajaa
 After a few hours, the Bombay High Court relieved Salman in the form of bail, but this bail is just for tonight
 shuukravaar ko adaalat nae sire se salmaan par faisla sunayega
 After all, what can happen in court on Friday
 
 Let me tell you bombai hoicourt main shuukravaar ko jamaanat par sunwaayee ke dauransalmaan khan kaa court main rahanaa jaruri nahinhai
 It is expected that he will sit in his Galaxy apartment in Bandra and wait for the court's decision with beating hearts
 ab agar bombai hai court se raahat kii khabar aati he, to phir salmaan bandra ke apane isi ghar main chaiyn kii neend so sakate hai
 But if the decision came against somewhere, on Wednesday like Wednesday, Salman will have to move the sessions court once again
 vahaan jaakar unhen khud ko sarender karnaa hoga
 And then he will have to go to Arthur Road Jail in police custody from Sessions Court
 or is tarah shuukravaar ko yecharon hi jagah salmaan ke liye khasahongi
 Now the biggest question is, what will happen or what can happen in the Bombay High Court on Friday? So to understand this, first understand that the Bombay High Court on Friday granted Salman Khan a two-day bail is interim bail
 or ye antarim jamaanat isliye di gai kyonki seshans court kefaisle kii copy salmanako nahin mili thi
 Actually, to challenge the decision of the Sessions Court in the High Court or to get bail, it is necessary that you have a copy of the judgment
 ab faisle kii copy salmaan ke vakil ko mil chuki he
 Judge Deshpande himself has given this copy to Salman's lawyer
 lihaaja ab aisi surat main shuukravaar ko adaalat main teen chijen ho sakati hai
 First, the High Court can grant Salman's appeal and extend the date of his bail, and give the next date of hearing of the case
 par ye taarikh garmi kii chuttee ke baad kii hi hogi
 The summer vacation in the court starts from 9 May and will be on till 7 June
 yani aisi surat main phirjun ke pehle hafte tak cese kii koi sunwaayeenhin hogi
 Second, the court dismisses Salman's bail appeal
 aisi surat main salmaan ko faisle ke fouran baad seshans court main jaakar sarender karnaa hoga or phir jail janaa hoga
 And thirdly, Kiselmann's lawyers plead in the court that they have received a copy of the judgment late, so that they can be given time to read it so that they can prepare the case properly
 aisi surat main bhi adaalat ko lage to wo salmaan ko agali taarikh dekar jamaanat kii miyaad badha sakati he
 On Friday, well-known lawyer Harish Salve will advocate for Salman in the Bombay High Court
 sutron ke mutabik agar bombai hai court shuukravaar ko salmaan kii jamaanat arji khaarij kar detii he to vakeelon kii ek team usee vakt supreme court main bhi jane kii taiyaari kar chuki hai
 By the way, it is the Bombay High Court which gave Salman Khan a great relief in this hit and run case in 2003
 nichali adaalat ke faisle ko palatate hue salmaan ke khilaaf gaiyr iradatan hatya kii dhara hataa kar, ab 12 saal baad usee bombai hai court main ek baar phir salmaan kii kismat kaa faisla hona he
 The BJP high command seems to be softening in the face of rebellious rebellion by Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to give him a vote till the upcoming panchayat elections in the state
 use bhay he ki yediurppa ko hataane se kahin in chunaavon main party ko baari khamiyaaz na na bhugatna pad jaae
 a senior BJP leader said, "yeddyurappa can be given time till the end of the panchayat elections
 ham abhi kisi antim nirnay par nahin panhuche hai
 Yeddyurappa has a good base in rural areas of Karnataka, where Lingayat voters are his supporters
 ‚Äô yediurppa ke beton ko rajya main beshkeemtee shahari bhoomi aavanton main aniyamitaayen baratane kaa maamla uchhalane par party alaakaman ne unase istipha dene ko kaha tha lekin vah baagi tevar apanaate hue abhi tak use taalte aa rahe hai
 The BJP is in a dilemma over the removal of Yeddyurappa, pressurizing the government to conduct an inquiry with the Joint Parliamentary Committee on scams such as Two Spetrum and Adarsh housing Society

 Yeddyurappa belongs to the Lingayat community which constitutes 19 percent of the vote of Karnataka
 iske alaava rajya ke kuch dharmik sampradaayon ke sant bhi khul kar unke samarthan main aa gaye hai
 With this, the central leadership of the BJP is trying to avoid making haste
 vaise bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv main se adhiktar kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar par agar bhrashtachar ke maamle main naitik dabaav banaae rakhana he to yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad se hataaya janaa chahie
 On the other hand, some BJP mps from Karnataka met senior leaders LK Advani and Sushma Swaraj today and urged them to keep Yeddyurappa as Chief Minister
 bataaya jaataa he ki adwani ne is saansadon se kaha ki yediurppa ke bare main antim nirnay karne kaa adhikaar bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko saunp diya gaya he
 Arun Jaitley and m Venkaiah Naidu spoke to Yeddyurappa this morning in an attempt to resolve the matter
 kal dilli panhuche yediurppa saarvajanik rup se ‚Äònaram-garam‚Äô donon ruukh apanaae hue hai
 Apart from talking about the party high command's decision, he is also saying that he has the support of 110 to 120 mlas
 vah yah daawa bhi kar rahe hai ki alaakaman ne unase istipha dene ko nahin kaha he or kendriya netritv unke in daavon par chupi saadhe hue he
