 kya kabhi aap soch sakate hai ki desh main avivaahit badi umr kii mahilaon ko bhi deh vyapaar main dhakelne main koi peeche nahin he
 Older women are trafficked and their purchasers are the working class
 ji haa, kyonki in mahilaon ke daam kam lagaaein jate hai or majdoor varg unhen kharidkar jindagibhar ke liye apana gulam bana letaa he
 This has been revealed in a report of the National Commission for Women
 ayog kii ek team ne pashchim bengal, jharkhand or bihar main mahilaon ko deh vyapaar main dhakelne kii ghatnaon par sangyaan lete hue in ilaakon main daura kiya or usee dauraan ye tamaam jaankariyaan saamne ain
 The report states that in West Bengal, unmarried women between 40 and 45 years of age are lured into making excuses and smuggling them and selling them to Bihari laborers for around Rs 25,000
 in mahilaon ko gharon main puri tarah se kaid karke rakhaa jaataa he, yadi koi mahila baahar bhagkar police se shikaayat karne main kaamyaab bhi ho jaati he to police bhi uski shikaayat gambhirtha se nahin leti
 In its report, the Commission has also specifically mentioned that most of the women, girls who are trafficked for sex trade, belong to the scheduled castes and tribes along with being poor
 kabhi-kabhaar jab aise maamle pakade bhi jate hai to police doshiyon ke khilaaf essi-asti privension of atrocity act 1989 ke tahat maamla darj nahin karti jisase doshi aasaani se chhot jate hai
 The commission, in its report, has also considered the traditional wedding customs in many areas of Bengal responsible for the trafficking of women
 shaadi ke baad duulhaa-dulhan teen din ke liye gaayab ho jate hai or is dauraan kai baar khud pati hi logon ke saath milakar apni patni ko bech detaa he
 Three days later, the girl's parents file a girl's missing report
 lekin tab tak ladki ko milon dur bhej diya jaataa he
 It has also been told in the report that there is no concrete arrangement for the shelter home to support these girls on recovery
 in ilaakon main help line number bhi thik se kaam nahin karata
 At the same time, the law made to punish the culprits who push women into the body trade has also become old and flexible
 deh vyapaar ke liye ladakiyon kii taskari ko rokane ke liye ayog ne apni siforeeshon main imoral trephiking privension act 1956 ko or zyada sakht banane kii baat kii he
 At the same time, it has asked to start several programs to make girls aware in rural and tribal areas
 ayog kaa ye bhi kahana he ki ghar ke bade sadasyon ko bhi jaagruk karne ke liye training dene kii jarurat he jisase wo bhi apni ladakiyon ko har kisi ke saath jane kii anumati naa den
 At the same time, the commission has also recommended to the police to be sensitive in such cases

 Some railway officials are also involved in this investigation

 During this time, some such evidence has also been found, which suggests that the accident of the indore-patna Express in Kanpur may be the result of a conspiracy

 Devotees of Vaishno Devi have received a great gift
 ab vah mata ke darshan ke liye jammu kii bajaay sidhe katra tak pahunch sakenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave this gift to the people by flagging the train service from Jammu to Katra on Friday
 padhie is aitihaasik maukey par modi kaa diya puraa bhaashan
 
 
 Modi smiled with a thunderous applause from Modi, then the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri NN Vohra, seated at Bolemunch, the Chief Minister of here, Mr
 Omar Abdullah ji, the Railway Minister, the focal point of today's celebrations, and who is always forever Anandamayi
 Sadananda Gowda ji, you will always see him smiling, child of this earth, my colleague of the Council of Ministers Dr
 jitendra singh ji, rajya rail mantri shriman manoj sinha ji, railway board ke chairman, upasthit sabhi mahanubhavek taraf shri amarnath yatra chal rahi he
 It is a very holy atmosphere
 duusari taraf ramajaan kaa pavitra maheenaa chal rahaa he
 And on the third side, today a Mars is being started to provide the facility of bringing her devotees across India at the feet of Goddess Vaishno Devi
 ek tarah se sab taraf pavitrataa kaa maahaul he
 i wish crores of devotees who come at the feet of Mother Vaishno Devi of the country
 ye sirf jammu kashmir ke liye suvidha nahin he
 Nor is it just an offering to them
 ye sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ko bhent he, jo yahaan aane ke liye lalayit rahete hai
 i had suggested to the Railway Minister that this arrangement from Delhi to Katra is being arranged to bring passengers from different corners of the country to Katra later and also by connecting to places
 is train ko shri shakti express ke naam se janaa jaae
 So that we are going at the feet of Goddess Vaishno Devi, the passengers will feel this
 main mata vaishno devi shrin board or governor sahab kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum ki yahaan railway stesan par technology kaa prabandh acha hua he
 Therefore, it will be sure for the traveler coming from any corner of India that his time is not spoiled
 aage kii yatra ke liye puri vyavastha or maargdarshan mili
 When development happens, it sometimes seems that if this happened there, what will happen to me
 jaise mukhyamantri ji ne jammu ke logon kii chintaa kaa zikr kiya
 i can say from experience that there will be no hindrance in the development there
 jo sidhe katra aayega, vah bhi jammu jaae bina nahin maanegaa
 Development journey of Jammu will become more quality
 jaise hi infrastracchar bana, uske agal bagal vikaas shuru ho jayega
 After the station was built here, the traders decorated their shops first
 unhen samaj he
 It is not just railway or travel facilities
 ye ek tarah se vikaas kii janani ban jaati he
 i think what Atal ji has launched to connect Jammu with rail, we have to take it forward
 banihaal tak patari le jaani he
 Not only this, the states and the Center are starting a new system for the first time in the history of the country
 hybrid vyavastha he
 Rail and bus connectivity has been done
 ab jinhen srinagar janaa he, unhen railway stesan par bas kii bhi tikat milegi
 And for further journey, railway ticket will also be available from Banihal and will reach Srinagar further
 bhavishya main bhi railway kaa vikaas karne ke liye centre or rajya kaa partnership model jitna viksit hoga, utana phayda hoga
 i agree with the Chief Minister
 hamaare railway stesan aise kyon puraane se dikhte hai
 Why not be better than our important railway station airport
 sirf jammuvasiyon ko hi nahin deshavaasiyon ko yakeen dilaataa hum
 We prioritize the development of railways, modernizing Metro City and their railway station
 airport se zyada adhik suvidhajanak railway stesan ho
 This is our dream
 ye kathin nahin he or aarthik rup se bhi jatil nahin he
 Recently i have discussed this in detail with friends of Railways
 jald aapako badlaav najar aayega
 It will also include private parties
 aane vaale dinon main jammu kashmir main vikaas ek nai takat kaise bane
 There are two important programs for this today
 pehla ye rail project
 Second
 uri main jaakar power project kaa udghaatan, jo jammu kashmir ko vikaas kii urja degaa
 i agree that our Himalayan States have many similar difficulties
 kai ek samaan avasar bhi hai
 If a common model is developed, then their solution will be done soon
 centre ke paas spasht vijan hoga
 States will have advanced models
 iskaa laabh jammu kashmir se lekar purvottar ke rajyon ko bhi milegaa
 When i have come to the land of Jammu and Kashmir today
 mata vaishno devi ke charnon main aayaa hum
 Took Mother's blessing even when she started the election campaign
 aaj vikaas yatra shuru kar rahaa hum, to vah bhi aashirwad ke saath kar rahaa hum
 i am sure we will get more strength from this
 tourism main yatriyon kii suvidha ke saath railway paryaavaran hitaishi vyavastha hoti he
 If this happens in Jammu and Kashmir, the world will be attracted
 ham is railway ke madhyam se ham paryaavaran hitaishi yatayaat ko bal de rahe hai
 We will take full care of the environment while developing in the Himalayan range
 yahaan railway stesan kaa udghaatan karne gaya
 Saw the scene there
 aisa kam dekhne ko miltaa he
 Get to the station from the mountain above
 maine turant kaha ki hindustan kaa yah aisa railway stesan ban saktaa he, jise puraa ham solar railway stesan bana sakate hai
 Chairman said that we will take it immediately
 desh ke liye ek model pesh karenge
 When the passengers come, they will get inspiration
 jammu kashmir anek kathinaaiyon se gujara he
 Now everyone wishes that this kingdom be happy, prosperous
 yahaan ke naujavaanon ko rojgaar mili
 You should have the opportunity to live a new life
 yahaan katra stesan par train main ja rahe bacchon se maine poocha
 How many saw the train
 train main baithe
 The first decade of the 21st century is gone
 un bacchon main 80 fisadi ne kaha
 We saw the train for the first time
 isamen baithe
 It is a matter of joy for them
 par hamaare liye sochane kaa vishay he
 How did we run that they got an opportunity after so many years
 hamaara daayitv banataa he ki sudur kone main baithe logon ko bhi vikaas kaa laabh milanaa chahie
 The person sitting till the end should meet
 atal ji ne jis vikaas yatra ko shuru kiya he
 We will take it forward
 hamaara makasad raajnneetik jai paraajay vaala nahin he
 i want to win the hearts of the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir
 ise vikaas ke madhyam se karnaa chahta hum
 With these words, i dedicate the Shri Shakti Express to the nation
 bahut bahut dhanyavad Congress President Sonia Gandhi accused the BJP of destroying the poison of communalism in society for the sake of power and destroying the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi
 vah bihar ke kishanganj jile main aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay (eemyu) kii shakha kaa shilanyas karne ke baad bol rahi thim
 Addressing the public meeting, Sonia said that they are bent on destroying the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone kaha, 'ek unmaadi vyakti ne rashtrapita kii hatya kar hamaare desh kii buniyadi manyataon ko kamjor karne kii koshish kii thi, aaj phir se ye shaktiyaan janata ko gumraah karne kii koshish main lagi hui hai
 By dissolving the poison of communalism in society under the greed of the chair, they are breaking the old ganga-jamuni culture of the country and by doing so they are bent on damaging the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi
 ''unka ganga-jamuni tahjeeb main yakeen nahin'sonia ne kaha ki yah vichaardhaaraon kii ladai kaa daur he or congress kii vichaardhaara dharmanirpekshita kii or dharmanirpeksh mulyon kii raksha kerani he jiskaa matlab sarvadharm sambhaav he
 He claimed that the Congress has always strengthened this foundation and it will be done further
 bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ek vichaardhaara unki he jinhen hamaari ganga-jumani tahjeeb main vishwaas bilkul hi nahin he
 Their aim is to divide the society among themselves and separate them on communal basis
 sonia ne kaha, 'unhen to keval ek hi cheez chahie, unke saamne to keval ek hi cheez he, unhen sirf kursi chahie
 Need a chair at any cost
 isliye aapako aise tabakon se saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 Taking a dig at the "lakhs and crores" given for the development of Bihar, Sonia said that the communal powers are making every effort to fool the people through their breathtaking speeches
 bihar main eemyu kii shakha ke shilanyas kaarykram ke bulaave ko lekar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or congress netaaon ke bich jari aarope-pratyarope ke bich sonia ne kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke netritv main hamaari samprag sarkaar ne bihar ke vikaas ke liye pichley das saalon ke dauraan ek lakh 34 hajaar crores rupee diya he
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi fiercely said that we have left no stone unturned in the progress of this state
 unhone centre kii ore se lagu kiye gaye khaadya suraksha kanoon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki isse shahar or gaanvon ke 80 karod garib pariwaron ko sasti keemat par anaaj milegaa
 Sonia said that new arrangements have been made in hospitals for pregnant women and their children
 sarkaar ke kaam-kaaj kaa bakhaan karte hue unhone kaha ki skool or madrason main bade paimaane par musalmaan bacchon ne daakhila liya he jisase muslim samudaay kii sakshartaa dar badi he
 He said that we have implemented most of the recommendations of the Sachar Committee and set up a corporation for the development of Waqf Board property

 a surprising case came to light in San Francisco, USA when Facebook disabled the Facebook account of Isis Anchalee
 aap soch rahe honge Isis kaa acount delit karne main hairaani kii baat kya he
 In fact, Facebook closed the account of San Francisco-based software developer 'isis Anchalee' as an account of terrorist organization 'ISIS'
 iske baad is yuvati ne fasebuk ke twitor handle par fasebuk ko twit kar bataaya ki vah aatankwaadi nahin balki uskaa naam 'isis' he
 @facebookwhy would you disable my personal account? MY REAL NAME IS ISIS ANCHALEE / facepalm — Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee) November 16, 2015 He also sent a copy of his passport to Facebook to confirm his name and also heard it to Facebook
 tab ja kar fasebuk ne unase maafee maangate hue unka account phir se shuru kiya
 @facebooki sent you my passport but it's not good enough for validation? - Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee) November 17, 2015isis said she sent her personal details to Facebook three times to enable her account
 unhone twitor par likhaa ki 'fasebuk mujhe aatankwaadi samajhataa he, maine unhen apane passport kii copy bhi bheji par shaayad fasebuk ke liye yah pramaan bhi meraa acount aneble karne ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 'facebook thinks I'm a terrorist
 Apparently sending them a screenshot of my passport is not good enough for them to reopen my account
 - Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee) November 17, 2015 Acaricature of Facebook re-enabled her account by replying to them on Twitter
 fasebuk ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki yah ek erar tha jo ferrcount ko report karne se hota he
 We apologize for this and enable their account again

 Former Indian all-rounder and BCCI contracted commentator Ravi Shastri defended the criticized BCCI president n Srinivasan, saying that if he had replaced this Tamil Nadu administrator, he would not have resigned like him
 tippaniyan Shastri said during the Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture, many people asked me if i would be his (srinivasan's) place
 to kya karata
 i also do not resign
 unhone kaha, shrinivasana ne jo kiya (jimmedaariyon ke nirvahan se hatana) vah yah he ki unhone sab kuch paak saaf karne kii jimmedaari uthaai he
 Shastri, who was in the IPL Governing Council, called Srinivasan an 'unmatched administrator'
 unhone kaha, shrinivasana asli cricket or khel premi hai, jinhone bisisiai ko kaaphi yogadan diya he
 Shastri said during the Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture, many people asked me if i would be his (srinivasan's) place

 Shastri, who was in the IPL Governing Council, called Srinivasan an 'unmatched administrator'
 unhone kaha, shrinivasana asli cricket or khel premi hai, jinhone bisisiai ko kaaphi yogadan diya he
 He said, what Srinivasan did (withdrawing from the discharge of responsibilities) is that he has taken up the responsibility of cleaning everything
 ipel kii sanchaalan parishad main shaamil shastri ne shrinivasana ko 'bejod prashaasak' qaraar diya
 He said, Srinivasan is a real cricket and sports lover, who has contributed a lot to the BCCI
 khelon kii kirti or chamak ke liye hindustan lambey vakt se apane cricketron kaa mohataaj rahaa he
 But for the last few years, new stars are emerging one after the other from other sports and a lot of credit goes to domestic league games like Pro Wrestling and Pro Kabaddi and just to name a few internationals like Asian Games and Badminton Super Series
 For live telecast of events
 yahaan jin purush or mahila khiladinnon or ek maamle main ladke—yani nishanebaaji main sansani banakar ubhare 16 saal ke saurabh choudhary—ke bare main bataaya ja rahaa he, ye sabhi aise jazbe se otprot hai jisane unhen apane chune hue khel main bheeshan mushkilon or baadhaon se paar pate dekha he
 These inspiring stories are not just those athletes who have made their name known in big events
 aise harek champion ke peeche samarpit coach bhi hai yaa kashmiri bat factory kii malkin rifat masudi sareekhe log bhi, jo apni banaai chizon ko lekar utane hi jazbe se bhare hai
 Overall, all these individuals are proof that the villages and small towns of India are the energy centers of talent, that is, the engines that give the country the power to strike high by its stature and stature as a game power

 diemke or ediemke dwarasrilankai tamilon kaa muddauthae jane se bhi sansad kii kaarywahi prabhavit hui
 In fact, as soon as the proceedings of Parliament started on Wednesday, the SP mps again started an uproar over Beni Prasad Verma's controversial statement

 He later reiterated his statement in Parliament, which caused a lot of uproar
 mangalvaar ko espi netaa ramgopal yadav ne bayaan diya ki benny prasad ke mantri bane rahane se hamen hi phayda he
 He went a step ahead and said that someone who has a big heart, forgives there
 baharhaal, yah vivaad ab phir se garmata ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the DMK and AIADMK are demanding that India be strictly against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva

 ) congress dilli adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kaha he ki kendra kii bhaajapa sarkaar tathaa aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar main mileebhagat he
 Therefore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has removed only 9 advisors appointed by the Delhi government, while the Shunglu Committee report found irregularities in the appointment of 71 supporters of the AAP party by the Delhi government
 maakan ne kaha ki aap party raghav chaddha tathaa atishi merlina ko 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ladvana chaahati he
 Therefore, he was removed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, so that he could get people's sympathy in the election
 ajay makanne kaha ki shungalu cameti kii report 28 november 2016 ko dilli ke uparajyapal ko saunp di gai thi, parantu grih mantralay ne shungalu cameti kii report par karrwai karne main itnaa samay kyon liya? yah lakh take kaa prashn he
 Ever since Rahul Gandhi became the president of the Congress, the graph of the Congress has been rising very fast due to which the BJP is badly scared
 ajay maakan ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke 9 salaahkaaron kii niyuktiyon ko radd kiye jane ke peeche bhaajapa kii kendra sarkaar or aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar kii mileebhagat he, kyonki shungalu cameti ne 28 navambar 2016 ko apni report dilli ke uparajyapal ko de di thi, jisamen aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar dwaara kii gai 71 niyuktiyon main aniyamitataayen pai gai thim, jabaki sarkaar ne keval 9 chuninda salaahkaaron ko hi hataaya he kyonki raghav chaddha tathaa atishi merlina jaise logon ko janata kii sahanubhuti dilaakar 2019 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladvana chaahati he
 Maken said that it is very surprising that the Shunglu Committee gave its report to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi on 28 November 2016 and why the order to remove 9 advisors was given in April 2018, that is after so long
 iske peeche unki kya manshaa he, yah spasht ho jaati he
 Maken citing the example of Atishi Marlina said that he was appointed as Advisor to the Deputy Chief Minister at a salary of one rupee per month, while Raghav Chadha was appointed as Advisor to the Finance Minister, about which the Shunglu Committee wrote a close chapter in its report , As he was appointed for only two and a half months
 maakan ne kaha ki jab raghav kii niyukti keval dhai maheene ke liye thi, to unako 9 salaahkaaron ke saath kyon hataaya gaya
 Behind this, the intention of the AAP party and BJP is clear that the two have met
 84 deshon ke numaayindon or 35,000 se zyaada pratibhaagiyon ke saath yoga ke do-do world record bana rahi bijepi ke netaaon kii nigaah akhir uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ko kyon khojati rahi? kya isliye ki ve musalmaan hai or unka farz banataa he ki wo yoga karke apni deshbhakti sabit karen? Crores of people did not do yoga in 1
25 billion countries
 ve sab deshadrohi nahin hai
 And of the thousands who did yoga, many of them do not deserve to be called patriots by their actions
 yani yoga vah paimaana nahin he jisase kisi kii deshbhakti maapi jaae
 Ideally, there should be no measure to measure one's patriotism
 ham desh se pyaar karte hai, kyonki desh main vah rajya, vah shahar or vah ghar hota he, jahaan ham rahete hai
 We have a connection with that
 lekin agar rose koi hamen yah sabit karne ko kahe ki ham apane ghar se, apane mulk se pyaar karte hai, koi rose hamaare sahaj judaav ke liye kasautiyaan banaae to achaanak ghar ho yaa mulk- donon paraye lagane lagate hai
 But why would anyone ask us to prove it? Because he considers us alien
 ram madhav or hamid ansaari ke maamle kii gutthi yahi he
 The ideological training that Ram Madhav grew up in, which he describes as his politics and culture, does not consider anyone other than Hindus to be a resident of India
 ye ikhari drushti yah bhi bhul jaati he ki hindustan ko hinduon ne hi nahin banaaya he, balki hindu jaisi sangya bhi kisi pracheen samskruti main nahin rahi he, hindustan bahut sari nadiyon, bahut sari zubaanon, bahut sari paramparaon, bahut saare jhanjhawaton kii chaak par gadha gaya he or ab bhi gadha ja rahaa he
 Countries have no idol, they are made from a beating society, they change again and again and still remain within us
 lekin sangh parivaar desh ke itihaas se aankh nahin milaataa, vartmaan se chidhata he or ek aise bhavishya kii kalpana karata he, jisamen sirf ek dharm kaa raaj ho
 Examples of how obscene and cruel a state is based on such a religion are scattered around us
 tippaniyan The good thing is that our democracy rejects this ideological unity of the Sangh Parivar
 vah bijepi ko majaboor karata he ki satta main aana he to apni vichaardhaara ko haashie par daale or sabko saath lekar chale
 In this compulsion, BJP talks about taking everyone along, but then imposes yoga on everyone and searches and see who did not do yoga
 agar vah musalmaan he to uski deshbhakti par sawalia nishaan he
 But if we have faith in democracy, then the BJP will have to give as much of the test that Muslims of this country are giving
 yaa to wo badalegi, nahin to log use badal daalenge
 Because history tells that in this country it was considered the same and the same elder, who took everyone along, who took everyone
 baaki ikhare or atyaachaari shaskaon kii tarah yaad kiye jate hai
 It is for the BJP to decide whether it will test Hamid Ansari or will test himself
 sava arab desh main karodon logon ne yoga nahin kiya
 They are not all traitors
 or jin hazaron logon ne yoga kiya, unamem se kai apni harqaton se deshbhakt kahalaane laayak nahin hai
 That is, yoga is not the scale by which one's patriotism is measured
 kaayade se kisi kii deshbhakti maapne kaa koi paimaana hona bhi nahin chahie
 We love the country, because the country consists of the state, the city, and the house where we live
 usase hamaara ek judaav hota he
 But if someone asks us to prove that we love our home, our country every day, then someone sets the criteria for our smooth engagement, then suddenly, either home or the country - both start feeling defeated
 lekin koi hamase yah sabit karne ko kyon kahegaa? kyonki vah hamen paraayaa maanata he
 This is the case of Ram Madhav and Hamid Ansari
 ram madhav jis vaicharik prashikshan main paley bade hai, jise ve apni raajnneeti or samskruti bataate hai, vah hinduon ke alaava kisi or ko hindustan kaa bashinda nahin maanati
 This single vision also forgets that Hindustan has not only made Hindustan, but also a noun like Hindu has not been in any ancient culture, Hindustan on the chalk of many rivers, lots of tongues, lots of traditions, lots of mess
 Has been coined and is still being coined
 deshon kii koi jad murti nahin hoti, ve ek dhadkate hue samaaj se banate hai, ve baar-baar badalte hai or phir bhi hamaare bheetar bane rahete hai
 But the Sangh Parivar does not lose sight of the country's history, is irritated by the present and imagines a future in which only one religion rules
 aise ek dharm par aadhaarit rajya kitne dakiyanoos or krur hote hai, iske udhaaharan hamaare aasapaas bikhare pade hai
 The comments acchhee baat yah he ki hamaara loktantr sangh parivaar ke is vaicharik ikharepan ko kaarij karata he
 He forces the BJP to come to power, marginalize his ideology and take everyone along
 is majaburi main bijepi sabko saath lene kii baat karti he, lekin phir sab par yoga thopati he or khoj-khoj kar dekhati he ki kisne yoga nahin kiya
 If he is a Muslim, his patriotism is questioned
 lekin agar loktantr par hamaara yaqiin he to der-saber jitne imtihaan is desh kaa musalmaan de rahaa he, utane hi bijepi ko dene honge
 Either it will change, otherwise people will change it
 kyonki itihaas bataata he ki is desh main vahi tikaa or vahi bada mana gaya, jisane sabko saath liya, jisane sabko saadh liya
 The rest are remembered as single and tyrannical rulers
 ye bijepi ko tay karnaa he ki wo hamid ansaari kaa imtihaan legi yaa khud insaaniyat kaa imtihaan degi
 But if someone asks us to prove that we love our home, our country every day, then someone sets the criteria for our smooth engagement, then suddenly, either home or the country - both start feeling defeated
 lekin koi hamase yah sabit karne ko kyon kahegaa? kyonki vah hamen paraayaa maanata he
 This is the case of Ram Madhav and Hamid Ansari
 ram madhav jis vaicharik prashikshan main paley bade hai, jise ve apni raajnneeti or samskruti bataate hai, vah hinduon ke alaava kisi or ko hindustan kaa bashinda nahin maanati

 This is the case of Ram Madhav and Hamid Ansari
 ram madhav jis vaicharik prashikshan main paley bade hai, jise ve apni raajnneeti or samskruti bataate hai, vah hinduon ke alaava kisi or ko hindustan kaa bashinda nahin maanati
 This single vision also forgets that Hindustan has not only made Hindustan, but also a noun like Hindu has not been in any ancient culture, Hindustan on the chalk of many rivers, lots of tongues, lots of traditions, lots of mess

 Examples of how obscene and cruel a state is based on such a religion are scattered around us
 tippaniyan The good thing is that our democracy rejects this ideological unity of the Sangh Parivar
 vah bijepi ko majaboor karata he ki satta main aana he to apni vichaardhaara ko haashie par daale or sabko saath lekar chale
 In this compulsion, BJP talks about taking everyone along, but then imposes yoga on everyone and searches and see who did not do yoga
 agar vah musalmaan he to uski deshbhakti par sawalia nishaan he
 But if we have faith in democracy, then the BJP will have to give as much of the test that Muslims of this country are giving

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter kerala ke ernakulam jile ke anathalay se mukt karakar jharkhand laae gaye 119 bacchon kii kahani main nayaa mode aata dikh rahaa he
 Now the officials have also started to believe that there has been a lapse in local and administrative level in such a large number of children going out
 is puri ghatana main parade ke peeche ek majboot giroh kaam kar rahaa he
 However, this is not an isolated incident
 darasal jharkhand ke doordaraj or gramin ilaakon se pralobhan dekar or bahala-phusalaakar naaballigon ko baahar bheja jaataa rahaa he
 But this time the incident is also very serious because all the children are aged between three to 12 years, of which more than half are girls
 bataaya ye bhi ja rahaa he ki inhen khadi ke deshon main bhi bheja janaa tha
 Seeing the seriousness of the case, Chief Minister Hemant Soren has ordered an SIT probe
 anathalay se mukt karaae gaye 119 bacchon main 44 ladke or 75 ladkiyaan hai
 These children continued to become victims of human traffickers
 sawaal uthta he ki itani badi sankhya main bacchon ke baahar jane par prashasan kii najar kyon nahin padi
 However, officials also believe that a racket is working behind this whole incident
 devgarh ke upayukta amit kumaar kehete hai ki saare bachche godda jile ke hai
 Khalida Farjana, CDPO of Podaihat (godda), says, "this is a big lapse
 dekhnaa hoga ki jamini str par kahaan chook hui he
 These children are said to have been taken to the orphanage of Ernakulam from Jasidih in two reserve bogies
 sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki jab in dinon rail tikaton ke liye itani maaraa-maari ho rahi he to in bacchon ke liye do puri bogiyaan kaise rigerv kara lee gayi
 CM Hemant Soren says, 'special investigation teams have been formed to find out the truth
 aarope he ki maanav taskaron ke is giroh main kathith taur par police or prashasan se jude log bhi shaamil hai
 However, the truth in this case will be revealed only after thorough investigation
 lekin is racket se jude logon ne jis bekhauf andaaj main is puri vaardaat ko anjaam diya he, usase yah baat to sabit ho hi jaati he ki in sabake peeche bade-bado kaa haath he
 There are thousands of cases of child trafficking in the state

 There were some lucky ones who were left out of their clutches but most are still missing
 bahut se aise maamle bhi he jo police tak pahunche hi nahin
 In such a situation, it is quite difficult to tell the number of these children
 (saath main, devgarh se shailendra mishra kii report) The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Sterlite Industries of Britain's Vetanda Group to pay a compensation of Rs 100 crore against pollution from its copper smelting plant in Tamil Nadu
 lekin, nyaayalay ne sanyantr band karne kii apil nahin maani he
 Bench chairman PK Patnaik, who is hearing the matter, said that the factory of this multinational company has been polluting the environment for a long time and will have to be compensated for it
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki muaavja kaa ‘dar hona chahie’ or isaki raashi company kii bhugtan kshamta dekh kar tay kii jaani chahie
 The bench said that in this case, without compensation of less than Rs 100 crore (without law), fear would not arise
 ’ haalanki nyaayalay ne us karaakhane ko band karne se inkaar kar diya or use band karne ke 2010 ke madras ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ko khajir kar diya
 The court said that compensation should be 'feared' and its amount should be determined by looking at the company's ability to pay
 khandpeeth ne kaha ki is maamle main, ‘100 karod se kam kii raashi ke muaavje ke bina (kanoon kaa) dar paidaa nahin hoga
 However, the court refused to close that prison and set aside the 2010 Madras High Court order to close it

 vittamantralay ne is sambandh main sabhi swytt sansthaanon ko haal main ek aadesh jari kar diya he
 While there is enthusiasm among the employees since this order, there is bound to be an atmosphere of fear in the employee due to the late issuance of this order and the background given to the new conditions and autonomous institutions with this order
 haal hi main vitt mantralay ne karyaalay gyaapan jari kar is sambandh main swytt sansthaanon se judaa aadesh diya he
 This order has been given with reference to the guidelines regarding the revision of salary of employees of quasi government organizations, autonomous organizations and statutory bodies etc
 established or financed or controlled by the Central Government
 vittamantralay ke aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki centre sarkaar dwaara sthapit or vittposhit athwa niyantrit ardh sarkari sanghathanon, swytt sanghathanon, sanvidhik nikaayon aadi main karyrat karmchaaree centre sarkaar ke karmchaaree nahin he or isiilie, centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke sambandh main kendriya sarkari karmchaariyon kii seva sharton ke bhaag ke taur par centre sarkaar dwaara lagu kiye gaye laabh aise swytt sanghathanon main karyrat karmchaariyon par sidhe lagu nahin hote
 This order states that autonomous organizations are expected to organize their tasks in such a way that their dependence on the central government for financial support to meet the additional financial burden is minimized and thus autonomous organizations are expected to That they become financially independent so that the central treasury does not bear any additional burden
 vittamantralay ke aadesh main uparokt di gai prishthbhumi main saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko swytt sanghathanon ke liye sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The government has also made it clear that the revised pay structure will be acceptable to the employees who will choose it as per the current rules
 vittamantralay main nideshak amar nath singh ne apane patrak main yah saaf kar diya he ki centre sarkaar ne centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke sambandh main saatven vetan ayog kii sifarish par aadhaarit vibhinn bhatton ke sambandh main abhi tak koi nirnay nahin liya he or isiilie, agle adeshon tak is tathy par dhyaan die bina ki sanshodhit vetanman angikaar kar liye gaye hai, swytt sanghathanon main vidyaman bhatte vartmaan niyamon or sharton ke anusaar sweekaarya rahenge
 It is noteworthy that the Narendra Modi government of the Center has started giving salary and allowances to all its employees according to the 7th Pay Commission
 1 janvari 2016 se is vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya gaya he or adhiktar vibhaagon main arier bhi de die gaye hai lekin centre sarkaar ke adheen aane vaale swytt sansthaanon main ise abhi bhi lagu nahin kiya gaya tha
 The comments amuman yah hota rahaa he ki jab bhi vetan ayog kii report aayaa karti thi, ise saath hi main swytt sansthaanon par bhi yah lagu hua karti thi
 There used to be only a separate line in the Central Government's notification stating that this Pay Commission report applied in parallel to the autonomous institutions under the Central Government
 lekin is baar sarkaar ne aisa nahin kiya tha
 Now it has been implemented under a new order
 saatven vetan ayog (pe kamishan) kii report ke notification ke saath sarkaar ne is baar swytt sansthaanon ke liye kuch nahin kaha tha

 is sambandh main sarkaar ne ek ke baad ek teen aadesh jari kar is vetan ayog ke jariye vetan or bhatton main hui vruddhi kaa laabh swytt sansthaanon ke karmiyon ko diya tha
 The order of the Ministry of Finance clearly states that the employees working in the quasi government organizations, autonomous organizations, statutory bodies, etc
 established and financed or controlled by the Central Government are not Central Government employees and, therefore, in relation to the Central Government employees The benefits implemented by the central government as part of the service conditions are such autonomous terms
 Directly do not apply to workers employed in formations
 is aadesh main kaha gaya he ki swytt sanghathanon se apane kaary is prakaar vyavasthit karne kii ummid kii jaati he ki atirikt vittiya bhaar ko puraa karne ke liye vittiya sahaayta hetu centre sarkaar par unki nirbharta nunatam ho or is tarah swytt sanghathanon se ummid kii jaati he ki ve vittiya rup se aatmanirbhar bane taaki kendriya rajkosh par koi atirikt bhaar na pade
 In the order given by the Finance Ministry, the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission have been accepted for autonomous organizations in the background given above
 sarkaar ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki sanshodhit vetan sanrachana un karmchaariyon ke li sweekaarya hogi jo vartmaan niyamon ke anusaar iskaa chayan karenge
 Director Amar Nath Singh in the Ministry of Finance has made it clear in his leaflet that the Central Government has not yet taken any decision in respect of various allowances based on the recommendation of the Seventh Pay Commission in respect of Central Government employees and hence, the next orders
 Till the fact that the revised pay scales have been adopted, the allowances existing in the autonomous organizations are in accordance with the current rules and conditions
 The issues are acceptable

 modi sarkaar main kendriya mantri sushamaa swaraj ne rahul gandhi ko espiji suraksha hatwa lene kii baat kahi he
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on Monday said in the Congress election manifesto that there was no discussion of the problem of terrorism in the country and its diagnosis and said that if Congress President Rahul Gandhi is committed to terrorism The problem is not an issue in elections, so why don't they remove the SPG (special Protection Team) engaged in their security
 vah somvaar ko mathura main bhaajapa kii soshal media ikai dwaara yojit kaaryakarta sammelan ko sambodhit karne pahunchi thim
 Taking a dig at the Congress and the Grand Alliance parties, he said, "they do not know the pulse of the public while the Prime Minister recognizes it well
" isiilie to unhone udi ke baad sargical strike or pulavama hamale ke baad air strike ke jariye pakistan ko usee kii bhashaa main jawaab dene kaa kaam kiya
 Swaraj said, "actually for the Congress, terrorism is not a problem in the country
 unke yahaan to aatankwaadiyon ko ‘ji' or ‘sahab' kahkar sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 That is why the Congress has not made any mention of this long-standing problem or its solution in the country in its manifesto, whereas the BJP is committed to eliminating terrorism altogether
 'unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye kaha, ‘main rahul gandhi kaa aahvaan karti hum ki vah yadi aisa sochate hai to khud bhi kyon espiji kii suraksha chaahate hai
 He should write a letter to the government and return the spg's security system
 tab desh kaa itnaa kharchaa to nahin hoga
 Swaraj said, "it is a matter of shame that when the army jawans play their lives and give a befitting reply to the terrorists, the Leader of the Opposition asks how many died, give proof ve apni sena ke kahe ko to nahin maanate
 But what the Pakistani army says, they accept it
 aise logon ko hamaari janata vot kyon degi

, presenting detailed data on all types of social use Recommended to do on the media
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, 'bhaajapa kaa sankalp patr pesh karte samay pradhanmantri ne saaf kaha he ki hamaari teen praathamiktaayen hai- rashtrawaad, antyoday or sushasan
 BJP is fully committed on all these three issues
 hamaari sarkaar ke liye raashtra kii suraksha sarvopari he

 aisa tark diya gaya tha ki is vyavastha se kendriya karmchaariyon ke pramotion or nai bhartiyon kaa rasta khulegaa
 However, the government has made its stand clear on this
 yah kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye raahat kii badi khabar maani ja rahi he
 This year the Economic Survey reported that due to the increasing elderly population in the country and the pressure of pension funding, many countries have started increasing the retirement age of pensionable employees

 He said that after the police firing during encroachment removal in Dhanbad, he wrote a letter to Chief Minister Arjun Munda asking him to call a special session of the Legislative Assembly to enact a law to regularize irregular colonies and settlements
 unhone kaha ki maharashtra main ullas nagar main adaalat ke aadesh par atikaraman hathaaye jane ke dauraan yahi hua tha or vahaan vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaakar kanoon paarit kiya gaya tha or logon kii samasya kaa nidaan kiya gaya tha

 Hurriyat president Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, however, clarified that the Hurriyat is committed to negotiating with the Center but added that the Prime Minister's 'winding-up initiative' of calling groups apart from mainstream political parties for talks is disappointing
 faruk ne kaha, ‘samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pattiyon kii ore nahin jadon kii ore dekho
 When asked about the Prime Minister's new offer of talks to the groups that stop the violence, Omar said, "we hope that instead of taking the winding path, the talks will be offered directly
" kashmir ek raajnneetik samasya he or hamen ek raajnneetik samaadhaan khojna hoga
 There can be no military solution to the Kashmir issue
 ’ hurriyat conference ke adhyaksh mirwij umr faruk ne kaha ki sarkaar ko hurriyat ke chaar sutreey kaarykram par aage badhanaa chahie
 He said, 'we all feel that sixty years have passed and the problem still remains
 hamen pattiyon ke bajaae jadon ko tatolna hoga
 The Hurriyat's suggested four-point program includes protecting human rights, gradually withdrawing the military and abolishing the 'black law'
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen yah tathy sweekaar karnaa chahie ki kashmir ek samasya he or bharat, pakistan evam kashmir ke logon ko aapas main baithkar ise hal karnaa chahie
 We all have to come together and arrive at a solution

 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said, "the Prime Minister should announce measures to provide some relief to the Kashmiris
" ham jo kah rahe hai, unke liye koi badi baat nahin he
 'they said that they are demanding' abolition of black laws, gradually removing the military and commitment to protect human rights
 ’mirwij ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki sarkaar yadi in par dhyaan de to anukool maahaul taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he or sabhi dalon ko baatcheet shuru kerani chahie
 On the Prime Minister's offer to leave the path of violence and talk to the groups that stop supporting terrorism, Mirwaiz said, "we are not hearing for the first time that the government is ready to talk to the groups who have left the path of violence Have given
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham ek raajnneetik samooh hai
 So we are hoping that he will take a more liberal approach and say that people with different views from mainstream political parties should also come forward
 ’hurriyat netaa ne kaha, ‘hamane ateet main baat kii lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 But there is no alternative except that the people of India, Pakistan and Kashmir sit together and resolve the issue
 ’ mirwij ne kaha ki kashmir par sabhi pakshon ke saath sarthak or rachanaatmak samvaad ke liye vah vachanabaddh hai or ‘tripaksheeya vaarta chaahate hai’ jisamen bharat or pakistan se alag-alag baat hogi
 He said that the Hurriyat hoped that the Prime Minister would be more liberal on the issue of human rights' but unfortunately, that was not emphasized much

 She stayed
 unhone kaha ki isse mujhe dukh or sadma pahunchaa
 Everything that happened happened without their knowledge and it is a fact

 The Chief Minister, however, said that action will be taken against Sasikala's husband m Natarajan and his relatives

 Demonetisation has been implemented in the country for more than a month
 is ek maheene ke dauraan bank or atm ke baahar lagi lambii qatari ek pareshaani bayaan kar hi rahi he
 But there is another aspect of this which is being considered by all economists of the country and the world
 bricks bank pramukh or purv bhartiya banker kevi kamath ne daawa kiya he ki lambii avadhi main desh kii sarkaar, arthvyavastha or aam aadmi ko bada phayda bhi pahunchnaa tay hai
 Know what are the 10 benefits of Hanotbandi that are fixed -1
 bhrashtachar par lagaamdesh main 500 or 1000 rupee kii pratibandhit karency kul karency kii 85 fisadi thi
 This currency was also an apparel of corruption in the country
 notebandi ke faisle ke baad se hi bhrashtachar ke liye is karency kaa istemaal ruk gaya he
 At the same time, the government is gradually operating the new currency issued so that it cannot be collected as black money
 2
 In order to create a cashless economy, it is necessary that more and more transactions are done in the country through digital means
 isse karency par desh kii nirbharta kam hogi or rigerv bank or anya baikon ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar ko karency sanchaalan main kam kharch karnaa padegaa
 The cashless economy will benefit the government as well as the common man, as his money will be more secure in digital exchanges
 3
 The imposition of fake currency was a serious problem of flow of fake currency from across the border
 nakli karency jiske haath pahunchati thi use utane mulya kaa turant nuksaan uthaanaa padataa tha
 At the same time, the government also had to resort to large networks for its prevention
 karency kaa kam istemaal (digital pement) or bade dinomination kii karency se ek jatke main desh se nakli karency saaf ho chuki he
 At the same time, because of the new security standard of the new currency, the economy will be protected from fake currency for the next several years
 4
 The real estate sector will be the biggest beneficiary in the real estate sector after transparency
 beete kai dashakon se real estate sectorcaledhan ke niveshka sabase bada jariya tha
 Due to this, it was common for the paper to have a big difference between the purchase of property and the actual purchase
 isse jahaan sarkaar ko stamp duty main bada nuksaan hota tha vahiin aam aadmi ko blikemani na hone ke chalate makaan kharidne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 5
 khatm hoga kaladhanotbandi ke baad desh main kaledhan ke khilaaf saamaajik badlaav laane ke kaam ko aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a fact that black money cannot be eliminated from any economy until it is boycotted at the social level
 abhi tak kaledhan kaa nivesh property or sona-chaandi main kiya jaataa tha jisase inaki keemat vaastavik keemat se hameshaa adhik bani rahati thi
 After demonetisation, the use of black money in these areas will be curbed
 6
 Parallel Economy will be closed with the help of money and corruption, there was always a parallel economy in the country
 desh main koyala kii khaadaan se lekar sadak kinare chaay or sabji bechney vaale is samanaantar arthvyavastha main shaamil rahete the
 Most people here used to carry out their economic activities, damaging the country's gross domestic income
 ab digital pement kii ore rujhaan or notebandi se khatm hue kaledhan kaledhan ke saath-saath is samanaantar iconomi ko mukhyadhara main jodne main aasaani hogi
 7
 badhegaa tex besadesh main digital pement ko badhaava dene kaa sabase bada phayda hoga ki bade se bade or chote se chote tranjaction bainkon ke paas darj honge
 The Income Tax Department will also be constantly monitoring these transactions
 jab desh main blike iconomi kaa aadhaar nahin rahegaa to jaahir he zyada se zyada log tex kaa bhugtan karne ke baad hi apni kharid-farokht ko puraa kar paaenge
 This will result in a rapid jump in the revenue of the Central Government, its financial deficit will be reduced and it will have enough resources to improve the country's infrastructure
 8
 Financial savings will be increased Before the ban, people in the country used to invest their savings in property, gold and jewelery
 jarurat padane par log ise blakemarket main bechakar ek baar phir karency main badal lete the
 Currently, more than 50 percent of the country's households keep their savings in these ways
 yahaan nivesh hua adhikansh paisa blikemani he
 Now after demonetisation, real estate and gold will not be able to give the expected returns, so that people will have to move to banks once again to keep their savings and resort to options like savings bank, demand draft and mutual funds
 The highest and safest returns will be found
 9
 Increase in banks' earnings; With the ban on black money, along with the fast growing digital payments, banks will now see a big increase in earnings
 is ijaphe kaa istemaal bank apana vistaar karne ke saath-saath graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye karengi
 On the other hand, the money collected by banks with demonetisation will also help them to overcome their old losses
 10 sasta hoga karjanotbandi ke baad se bainko ko rahe phaayde kaa sidhaa asar desh main byaaj daron par padana tay he
 Along with transparency in the financial world, banks will try to give more and more loans to spread their business
 vahiin graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye vah karj par lagane vaale byaaj daron main badi katautee kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 With this, loans for business, buying cars or scooters or business in the country will start getting cheaper rates

 The official statement of Prasoon Joshi has come on the news of Padmavati getting clearance from CBFC
 unhoneajatkako bataaya ki padmavati main sensor kii ore se kisi bhi tarah ke cat lagane kii salaah nahin di gai he
 The news related to this in the media is misleading
 bataa den ki padmavati kii samiksha ke liye sensor ne panel kaa gathan kiya tha
 After review, the censor agreed to release the film with some changes at a meeting on 28 December
 ajtak ko sutron ne bataaya ki panel kii teen badi aapattiyon (film kaa tital, ghumar dance or disclemur) par nirmaataa badlaav ko taiyaar hai
 After this change, the censor board will give UA certificate to the film
 CBFC par mewar ke purv rajpariwaar ne uthaae sawaal, padmavat ke naam se relies hogi bhansaali kii 'padmavati'prasoon joshi ne shanivaar ko in paanch sawaalon ke jawaab die1
 Are many cuts being put in the film as some media houses say? Prasoon: Wrong
 sensor board ne koi bhi cat lagane kaa suzav nahin diya he
 Only 5 changes are suggested
 jo is tarah hai-a)
 Replacing Disclaimer that does not claim the film's historical facts to be true
 b)
 After discussion, the title of the film was changed from 'padmavati' to 'padmavat', to make it clear that the makers' film is based on the epic 'padmavat'
 c)
 Necessary changes should be made according to the character in the film's song Ghoomar
 d)
 Wrong, misleading references and historical place names in the film should be changed
 e)
 The film should include a disclaimer which clearly states that 'johar' is not being glorified
 padmavat ke naam se relies hogi 'padmavati', 3 badlaav par raji CBFC2
 Are the producers of the film agreeing on these changes? Prasoon: Yes, the producers of the film are completely in agreement with this
 isamen nirmaataa or nirdeshak shaamil hai

 CBFC ne kab dekhi film?prasoon :28 disambar kii shaam film dekhi gai, jahaan ejamining cameti, special panel ke saath main maujuud tha
 The screening was followed by a meeting with the makers and a lengthy discussion
 bhansaali kii padmavati ko CBFC kii hari jhandi, nae tital ke saath ho sakati he relies!4
 Why such a special panel? Prasoon: In view of the atmosphere and complexities related to the film, such a panel was needed so that the censor board can think thoroughly on all the aspects before final decision
 meeting main koun-koun shaamil tha?meeting main CBFC chif prasoon joshi, udaipur purv rajpariwaar ke sadsy arvind singh mewar, jaipur uniwarsity ke dow chandramni singh or professor ke

 The panel members made suggestions with historical events related to Padmavati and claims on several aspects
 kya he padmavati par jari vivadfilm ko lekar lambey samay se hangaamaa he
 It is alleged that Bhansali has twisted Padmavati's personality
 aarope he ki film main rani padmavati or khilji ke bich dream sikvence he
 However, Bhansali himself has dismissed this fact
 baad main ek bayaan main unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki unki film maalik mohammad jaaysi kii padmavat par aadhaarit he
 On December 12, the proposed film got stuck in the censor due to controversy and postponed its release date
 bhansaali ko sansadeey cameti ke saamne bhi pesh hona padaa, jahaan wo kai sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de paae
 There is discussion that if the film can be released next year
 haalanki abhi sensor ko ise paas karnaa he
 Controversies about Padmavati have also not subsided

 Mr

 bharat kii janata ne aapako aseem pyaar diya he, koi kami rah gai ho, to aap usase maang sakate hai, wo khushi-khushi de degi
 But it does not suit the Prime Minister of India to follow such people, who grieve when the critics are alive
 aaj jabase altnews
 In it is read that people in the whatsapp group named 'un Dharma Rakshati Rakshit:' had been abusive, threatening, communal, and calling me supreme patriots like me and other journalists as terrorists for a few months
 Been, you follow some of them on Twitter, i have been scared
 pradhanmantri ji, is whotsap group main mujhe or kuch patrakaron ko lekar jis starhin bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya gaya wo agar main pard duun to sunne vaale kaan band kar lenge
 It is my responsibility to consider you even in my strictest criticisms
 mahila patrakaron ke sammaan main jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya gaya he wo sharmnaak he
 Hate speech is also used on social media
 jiskaa mujhe vaaqai afsos he
 But here is the matter from your side, who have been threatening the lone journalist like me
 jab bhi is whotsap group se alag hone kaa prayaas kiya, pakad ise, bhaag rahaa he, maar ise, tip kii bhashaa kaa istamaal kar waapas jod diya gaya
 Politics has created this crowd on social media and on the road, one day it will become a big challenge for society, especially for women
 inaki gaaliyaan mahila-virdohi hoti hai
 They are so communal that you should not tolerate them at all
 vaise bhi 2022 tak bharat se sampradayikta mitaa dena chaahate hai
 Your speech of 15 August also did not affect them and they have been threatening me till recently
 ab meraa aapse ek sawaal he
 Do you really follow Neeraj Dave and Nikhil Dadhich? Why do? a few days ago i made some screen shots of his whatsapp group on my Facebook page @ravishkapage
 altnews
 The investigation of Prateek Sinha and Nilesh Purohit in
 reveals that the group member Neeraj Dave is a resident of Rajkot and is the managing director of an export company
 niraj dave ko aap follow karte hai
 When i wrote that do not use such profane language, i write that i am sad that you are still alive
 whotsap group ke ek or sadsy nikhil dadhich ke bare main kitna kuch likhaa gaya
 You will never like what Nikhil Dadhich said about journalist Gauri Lankesh when he was killed, it is another matter that you are following that person till now
 agar meri jaankaree sahi he to
 Recently, bjp's IT cell chief Amit Malviya shared a video of my speech edited incorrectly
 isse bhram failaa
 altnews
 in ne use bhi ujagar kiya magar amit malviya ne afsos tak prakat nahin kiya
 But Sir, i had no idea that this Nikhil Dadhich is sitting in my mobile phone
 ghor sampradayik whotsap group kaa sadsy he jisase mujhe jabaran joda jaataa he
 Where violent words are used about me
 vaaki maine nahin sochaa tha ki is group ke sadasyon ke taar aap tak pahunchenge
 i wish altnews
 in kii yah padtaal galat ho
 Nikhil Dadhich has pictures with many of your ministers
 yahi nahin, 'uun dharm rakshati rakshit:' group ke kai admin hai
 Many administrators are named RSS, RSS-2
 ek admin kaa naam akaash soni he
 India's second woman defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman Ji, Health Minister JP Nadda and Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari have a picture of Akash Soni
 tasviir kisi kii bhi kisi ke saath ho sakati he lekin yah to kisi ko dhamkaane yaa sampradayik baaten karne kaa group chalaata tha
 If someone writes about you, the administrator of his whatsapp group is arrested
 maine aisi kai khabaren padhi hai
 Is Akash the chief executive of Sony RSS? Akash Soni has made public the phone numbers of Abhisar Sharma, Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha Dutt including me
 altnews
 This has been stated in the report of in
 pehle bhi aapke netritv main chalane vaale sanghathan ke netaaon ne meraa number saarvajanik kiya he or dhamkiyaan mili hai
 i was upset but could not write you a letter
 is baar likh rahaa hum kyonki main jaananaa chahta hum or aap bhi pataa karavaaen ki kya is whotsap group ke log meri jaan lene kii had tak ja sakate hai? kya meri jaan ko khatara he? i am a normal citizen and a little but conscious journalist
 jiske bare main aajkal har doosraa kahkar nikal jaataa he ki jaldi hi aapaki krupa se sadak par aane vaala hum
 It was also celebrated on social media recently that now my job will go
 kaiyon ne kaha or kehete hai ki sarkaar mere peeche padi he
 Recently, Hindustan Times editor Bobby Ghosh was fired due to your dislike
 isaki khabar maine thewire
 i studied in kehete hai ki ab meri baari he
 Hearing this all makes me laugh but i am worried
 mujhe yakeen karne kaa ji nahin karata ki bharat kaa ek shashakt pradhanmantri ek patrkaar kii naukari le saktaa he
 Then people say that it is a matter of few days, see, your arrangements have been made
 aisa he kya sar? It is a privilege for me to be like this
 parantu aisa mat hone dijiega
 Not for me, for the pride of the great democracy of India, otherwise people will say that even if my voice is different, even if it is different, is there no room left for me in this great democracy? Will there be a provision for taking the job of a journalist from the level of Prime Minister and Finance Minister? i see such speculation related to the threats given in the whatsapp group
 agar aap in logon ko follow nahin karte to main sahi main yah patr nahin likhata
 i have an aluminum box that i brought to Delhi
 in 27 varshon main ishwar ne mujhe bahut kuch diya magar wo baksaa aaj bhi he
 i can return to Motihari with that box, but the family also has an obligation
 rojgaar kii chintaa kise nahin hoti he
 Great artists continue to advertise after seventy-five years of age, so that they can earn money
 jab itane paise waalon ko ghar chalaane kii chintaa hoti he to main kaise us chintaa se alag ho saktaa hum
 i also have aap mere bacchon ko to sadak par nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Would you like? Hate me so much? My children will still bless you
 mujhe sadak se pyaar he
 i will continue to question on the road
 champaran aakar baapu ne yahi to misaal di ki satta kitni badi ho, jagah kitni bhi anjaan ho, naitik bal se koi bhi uske saamne khadaa ho saktaa he
 i am a small fraction of that great soil
 main kisi ko daraane ke liye sach nahin bolta
 Bapu used to say that the truth in which ego comes is not true
 main khud ko or adhik vinamr banane or apane bheetar ke antarvirodhon ko lekar praayshchit karne ke liye bolta hum
 When i cannot speak, i cannot write, then i struggle with that truth
 main apni tamaam kamazoriyon se azaad hone ke sangharsh main hi wo baat kah detaa hum jise sunakar log kehete hai ki tumhen sarkaar se dar nahin lagata
 i am afraid of my weaknesses
 apni kamazoriyon se ladane ke liye hi bolta hum
 i write kai baar haar jaataa hum
 Then he would comfort himself that he failed this time, i will try to pass next time
 satta ke saamne bolnaa us saahas kaa pradarshan he jiskaa adhikaar samvidhan detaa he or jiske sangrakshak aap hai
 The comments main yah patr saarvajanik rup se bhi prakashit kar rahaa hum or aapako dak dwaara bhi bhej rahaa hum
 If you know Nikhil Dadhich, Neeraj Dave and Aakash Soni, then just ask them if they or any of their groups have a plan to kill me
 patr likhane ke kram main agar maine aapkaa anadar kiya ho, to maafi maangana chaahunga

 Do you really follow Neeraj Dave and Nikhil Dadhich? Why do? a few days ago i made some screen shots of his whatsapp group on my Facebook page @ravishkapage
 altnews
 The investigation of Prateek Sinha and Nilesh Purohit in
 reveals that the group member Neeraj Dave is a resident of Rajkot and is the managing director of an export company
 niraj dave ko aap follow karte hai
 When i wrote that do not use such profane language, i write that i am sad that you are still alive
 whotsap group ke ek or sadsy nikhil dadhich ke bare main kitna kuch likhaa gaya
 You will never like what Nikhil Dadhich said about journalist Gauri Lankesh when he was killed, it is another matter that you are following that person till now
 agar meri jaankaree sahi he to
 Recently, bjp's IT cell chief Amit Malviya shared a video of my speech edited incorrectly
 isse bhram failaa
 altnews
 in ne use bhi ujagar kiya magar amit malviya ne afsos tak prakat nahin kiya
 But Sir, i had no idea that this Nikhil Dadhich is sitting in my mobile phone
 ghor sampradayik whotsap group kaa sadsy he jisase mujhe jabaran joda jaataa he
 Where violent words are used about me
 vaaki maine nahin sochaa tha ki is group ke sadasyon ke taar aap tak pahunchenge
 i wish altnews
 in kii yah padtaal galat ho
 Nikhil Dadhich has pictures with many of your ministers
 yahi nahin, 'uun dharm rakshati rakshit:' group ke kai admin hai
 Many administrators are named RSS, RSS-2
 ek admin kaa naam akaash soni he
 India's second woman defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman Ji, Health Minister JP Nadda and Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari have a picture of Akash Soni
 tasviir kisi kii bhi kisi ke saath ho sakati he lekin yah to kisi ko dhamkaane yaa sampradayik baaten karne kaa group chalaata tha
 If someone writes about you, the administrator of his whatsapp group is arrested
 maine aisi kai khabaren padhi hai
 Is Akash the chief executive of Sony RSS? Akash Soni has made public the phone numbers of Abhisar Sharma, Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha Dutt including me
 altnews
 This has been stated in the report of in
 pehle bhi aapke netritv main chalane vaale sanghathan ke netaaon ne meraa number saarvajanik kiya he or dhamkiyaan mili hai
 i was upset but could not write you a letter
 is baar likh rahaa hum kyonki main jaananaa chahta hum or aap bhi pataa karavaaen ki kya is whotsap group ke log meri jaan lene kii had tak ja sakate hai? kya meri jaan ko khatara he? i am a normal citizen and a little but conscious journalist
 jiske bare main aajkal har doosraa kahkar nikal jaataa he ki jaldi hi aapaki krupa se sadak par aane vaala hum
 It was also celebrated on social media recently that now my job will go
 kaiyon ne kaha or kehete hai ki sarkaar mere peeche padi he
 Recently, Hindustan Times editor Bobby Ghosh was fired due to your dislike
 isaki khabar maine thewire
 i studied in kehete hai ki ab meri baari he
 Hearing this all makes me laugh but i am worried
 mujhe yakeen karne kaa ji nahin karata ki bharat kaa ek shashakt pradhanmantri ek patrkaar kii naukari le saktaa he
 Then people say that it is a matter of few days, see, your arrangements have been made
 aisa he kya sar? It is a privilege for me to be like this
 parantu aisa mat hone dijiega
 Not for me, for the pride of the great democracy of India, otherwise people will say that even if my voice is different, even if it is different, is there no room left for me in this great democracy? Will there be a provision for taking the job of a journalist from the level of Prime Minister and Finance Minister? i see such speculation related to the threats given in the whatsapp group
 agar aap in logon ko follow nahin karte to main sahi main yah patr nahin likhata
 i have an aluminum box that i brought to Delhi
 in 27 varshon main ishwar ne mujhe bahut kuch diya magar wo baksaa aaj bhi he
 i can return to Motihari with that box, but the family also has an obligation
 rojgaar kii chintaa kise nahin hoti he
 Great artists continue to advertise after seventy-five years of age, so that they can earn money
 jab itane paise waalon ko ghar chalaane kii chintaa hoti he to main kaise us chintaa se alag ho saktaa hum
 i also have aap mere bacchon ko to sadak par nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Would you like? Hate me so much? My children will still bless you
 mujhe sadak se pyaar he
 i will continue to question on the road
 champaran aakar baapu ne yahi to misaal di ki satta kitni badi ho, jagah kitni bhi anjaan ho, naitik bal se koi bhi uske saamne khadaa ho saktaa he
 i am a small fraction of that great soil
 main kisi ko daraane ke liye sach nahin bolta
 Bapu used to say that the truth in which ego comes is not true
 main khud ko or adhik vinamr banane or apane bheetar ke antarvirodhon ko lekar praayshchit karne ke liye bolta hum
 When i cannot speak, i cannot write, then i struggle with that truth
 main apni tamaam kamazoriyon se azaad hone ke sangharsh main hi wo baat kah detaa hum jise sunakar log kehete hai ki tumhen sarkaar se dar nahin lagata
 i am afraid of my weaknesses
 apni kamazoriyon se ladane ke liye hi bolta hum
 i write kai baar haar jaataa hum
 Then he would comfort himself that he failed this time, i will try to pass next time
 satta ke saamne bolnaa us saahas kaa pradarshan he jiskaa adhikaar samvidhan detaa he or jiske sangrakshak aap hai
 The comments main yah patr saarvajanik rup se bhi prakashit kar rahaa hum or aapako dak dwaara bhi bhej rahaa hum
 If you know Nikhil Dadhich, Neeraj Dave and Aakash Soni, then just ask them if they or any of their groups have a plan to kill me

 nikhil dadhich kii to aapke kai mantriyon ke saath tasviren hai
 Not only this, there are many administrators of the group 'un Dharma Rakshati Rakshit:'
 kai admin ke naam RSS, RSS-2 rakhe gaye hai
 One admin is named Akash Soni
 bharat kii duusari mahila rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ji, swasthya mantri jepi nadda ji or dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke saath akaash soni kii tasviir he
 The picture can be with anyone, but it used to run a group of threatening or communal talk
 aapke bare main koi likh detaa he to uske whotsap group ke admin ko giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 i have read many such news
 kya akaash soni RSS kaa pramukh padaadhikari he? akaash soni ne mere sahit abhisar sharma, rajdeep saradesai or barkhaa dutt ke phone number ko apane pej par saarvajanik kiya he
 altnews
 in kii report main yah baat bataai gai he
 Even before, the leaders of the organization running under your leadership have made my number public and received threats
 main pareshaan to hua parantu aapako patr likhane nahin baitha
 i am writing this time because i want to know and let you also know whether people of this whatsapp group can go to the extent of killing me? Is my life in danger? main ek saamaanya naagarik hum or adana-sa parantu sajag patrkaar hum
 About whom every other day it comes out saying that soon i will come on the road with your grace
 soshal media par pichley dinon iskaa utsav bhi manaaya gaya ki ab meri naukari jaaegi
 Many said and say that the government is after me
 haal hi main hindustan times ke sampadak bobi ghosh ko aapaki naapsandgi ke kaaran chalata kar diya gaya
 i reported this to thewire
 in main padhi
 It is my turn now
 yah sab sunakar hansi to aati he par chintit hota hum
 i do not believe that a strong Prime Minister of India can take the job of a journalist
 tab log kehete hai ki thode dinon kii baat he, dekh lenaa, tumhaara intazaam ho gaya he
 Is this so sir? aisa hona mere liye saubhaahgya kii baat he
 But don't let this happen
 mere liye nahin, bharat ke mahaan loktantr kii shaan ke liye, varanaa log kahenge ki agar meri awaz alag bhi he, talkh bhi he to bhi kya is mahaan loktantr main mere liye koi jagah nahin bachi he? ek patrkaar kii naukari lene kaa intazaam pradhanmantri or vittamantri ke str se hoga? aisi atakalon ko main whotsap group main di jane vaali dhamkiyon se jodakar dekhtaa hum
 If you do not follow these people, i do not write this letter in the right way
 mere paas aluminium kaa ek baksaa he jise lekar dilli aayaa tha
 In these 27 years God gave me a lot, but that box is still there
 main us bakse ke saath motihaari laut saktaa hum, lekin parivaar kaa daayitv bhi he
 Who does not worry about employment
 bade bade kalakaar sattar-pachhattar saal ke hokar vigyaapan karte rahete hai, taaki paise kama saken
 When so many people worry about running a house, then how can i separate from that worry
 mujhe bhi he
 You would not like to see my children on the street
 chahenge? mujhase itani nafrat? mere bachche tab bhi aapako dua denge
 i love the road main sadak par aakar bhi sawaal karata rahoonga
 On coming to Champaran, Bapu gave the example of how big the power is, no matter how unknown the place, one can stand before him with moral force
 main us mahaan mitti kaa chota sa ansh hum
 i do not speak the truth to scare anyone
 baapu kehete the ki jis sach main ahankaar aa jaae wo sach nahin rah jaataa
 i speak to make myself more humble and atone for the contradictions within me
 jab main bol nahin paata, likh nahin paata, tab us sach ko lekar jujhataa rahata hum
 In the struggle to be free from all my weaknesses, i say the thing that people hear and say that you do not fear the government
 mujhe apni kamazoriyon se dar lagata he
 i speak only to fight my weaknesses
 likhata hum
 Lose many times tab khud ko yahi dilasa detaa ki is baar fail ho gaya, agali baar paas hone kii koshish karuunga
 Speaking in front of power is a display of courage whose authority the Constitution gives and whose protector you are
 tippaniyan i am also publishing this letter publicly and sending it to you by post
 agar aap nikhil dadhich, niraj dave or akaash soni ko jaanate hai to unase bas itnaa puch lijie ki kahin inkaa yaa inke kisi group kaa mujhe maarane kaa plan to nahin he
 In order to write the letter, if i disrespected you, i would like to apologize
 aapkaa shubhachintak ravish Kumar patrkaar NDTV India yahi nahin, 'uun dharm rakshati rakshit:' group ke kai admin hai
 Many administrators are named RSS, RSS-2
 ek admin kaa naam akaash soni he
 India's second woman defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman Ji, Health Minister JP Nadda and Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari have a picture of Akash Soni
 tasviir kisi kii bhi kisi ke saath ho sakati he lekin yah to kisi ko dhamkaane yaa sampradayik baaten karne kaa group chalaata tha
 If someone writes about you, the administrator of his whatsapp group is arrested
 maine aisi kai khabaren padhi hai
 Is Akash the chief executive of Sony RSS? Akash Soni has made public the phone numbers of Abhisar Sharma, Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha Dutt including me

 This has been stated in the report of in
 pehle bhi aapke netritv main chalane vaale sanghathan ke netaaon ne meraa number saarvajanik kiya he or dhamkiyaan mili hai
 i was upset but could not write you a letter
 is baar likh rahaa hum kyonki main jaananaa chahta hum or aap bhi pataa karavaaen ki kya is whotsap group ke log meri jaan lene kii had tak ja sakate hai? kya meri jaan ko khatara he? i am a normal citizen and a little but conscious journalist
 jiske bare main aajkal har doosraa kahkar nikal jaataa he ki jaldi hi aapaki krupa se sadak par aane vaala hum
 It was also celebrated on social media recently that now my job will go
 kaiyon ne kaha or kehete hai ki sarkaar mere peeche padi he
 Recently, Hindustan Times editor Bobby Ghosh was fired due to your dislike
 isaki khabar maine thewire
 i studied in kehete hai ki ab meri baari he
 Hearing this all makes me laugh but i am worried
 mujhe yakeen karne kaa ji nahin karata ki bharat kaa ek shashakt pradhanmantri ek patrkaar kii naukari le saktaa he
 Then people say that it is a matter of few days, see, your arrangements have been made
 aisa he kya sar? It is a privilege for me to be like this
 parantu aisa mat hone dijiega
 Not for me, for the pride of the great democracy of India, otherwise people will say that even if my voice is different, even if it is different, is there no room left for me in this great democracy? Will there be a provision for taking the job of a journalist from the level of Prime Minister and Finance Minister? i see such speculation related to the threats given in the whatsapp group
 agar aap in logon ko follow nahin karte to main sahi main yah patr nahin likhata
 i have an aluminum box that i brought to Delhi
 in 27 varshon main ishwar ne mujhe bahut kuch diya magar wo baksaa aaj bhi he
 i can return to Motihari with that box, but the family also has an obligation
 rojgaar kii chintaa kise nahin hoti he
 Great artists continue to advertise after seventy-five years of age, so that they can earn money
 jab itane paise waalon ko ghar chalaane kii chintaa hoti he to main kaise us chintaa se alag ho saktaa hum
 i also have aap mere bacchon ko to sadak par nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Would you like? Hate me so much? My children will still bless you
 mujhe sadak se pyaar he
 i will continue to question on the road
 champaran aakar baapu ne yahi to misaal di ki satta kitni badi ho, jagah kitni bhi anjaan ho, naitik bal se koi bhi uske saamne khadaa ho saktaa he
 i am a small fraction of that great soil
 main kisi ko daraane ke liye sach nahin bolta
 Bapu used to say that the truth in which ego comes is not true
 main khud ko or adhik vinamr banane or apane bheetar ke antarvirodhon ko lekar praayshchit karne ke liye bolta hum
 When i cannot speak, i cannot write, then i struggle with that truth
 main apni tamaam kamazoriyon se azaad hone ke sangharsh main hi wo baat kah detaa hum jise sunakar log kehete hai ki tumhen sarkaar se dar nahin lagata
 i am afraid of my weaknesses
 apni kamazoriyon se ladane ke liye hi bolta hum
 i write kai baar haar jaataa hum
 Then he would comfort himself that he failed this time, i will try to pass next time
 satta ke saamne bolnaa us saahas kaa pradarshan he jiskaa adhikaar samvidhan detaa he or jiske sangrakshak aap hai
 The comments main yah patr saarvajanik rup se bhi prakashit kar rahaa hum or aapako dak dwaara bhi bhej rahaa hum
 If you know Nikhil Dadhich, Neeraj Dave and Aakash Soni, then just ask them if they or any of their groups have a plan to kill me

 He said that the government is not going to privatize the railway
 hamaara lakshya railway main badi maatra main nivesh karnaa he, iske liye ham public privet partnership par vichaar kar rahe hai
 In addition, we will connect the world's latest technology with the railways
 haal hi main aise khabaren ai thim ki rail mantralay ne 50 railway steshnon or 150 trainon ke nijeekaran ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 The NITI Aayog also wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Railway Board regarding privatization
 is khat main 400 railway steshnon ko vishwa str kaa banaae jane ko lekar zikr he
 What is the matter? There were reports that the Ministry of Railways had formed a committee to privatize 50 railway stations and 150 trains
 is cameti main niti ayog ke siio, railway board ke chairman, department of iconomic afares ke secretary, ministry aaf houseing and urban afares ke secretary or financial kamishnar (railway) shaamil hai
 Railways is set to operate 150 trains to private companies
 bataaya gaya tha ki is bare main rail mantralay ne faisla le liya he
 NITI Aayog wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Railway Board regarding the privatization of NITI Aayog
 is khat main 400 railway steshnon ko vishwa str kaa banaae jane ko lekar zikr kiya gaya tha
 It was said that such things have been done for many years, but in fact it has not been implemented anywhere except a few stations
 chunaav aate hi kuch yuva patrkaar whotsap karne lagate hai ki mujhe chunaav yatra par le chaliye
 Want to learn from you ladkaa or ladki donon
 My answer to both is 'no'
 yah sambhav nahin he
 Some people have crossed the border
 manaa karne par samaj janaa chahie, par kai log nahin maanate hai
 i keep messaging again and again, so i am writing here
 yah kyon sambhav nahin he? pehla kaaran yah he ki kitne logon ko saath le ja saktaa hum? ham log vyavastha se chalate hai
 It has a limited budget of its own
 gaadi main vaise hi jagah nahin hoti he
 Shall i take the bus to teach people? Then wherever i go, there will be a stampede
 apni story kaa hisaab dena hota he, pehla or aakiri fokas use puraa karne kaa hota he
 This is called deadline
 hai-hello karne kii fursat nahin hoti he, isliye mujhe pataa he, yah sambhav nahin he
 When i am on reporting, i think nothing but my own story
 doosraa, kaaran yah he ki ham doctor nahin he ki oparation teble par mariz ko litaakar vahaan aant or daant bataane lagen
 They run about worrying about completing their story
 jo saath main hoga, vah vahi dekhegaa ki yahaan rukaa
 Where did you talk? ise dekhakar koi kya sikhega? vaise bhi puri prakriya aap 'prime Time' main dekh sakate hai
 There is very little editing, so you can guess what i might have done
 teesri baat, naukari maangane main koi buraai nahin he
 i do not bother with it
 main bhi jab naukari khojataa tha, to 10 logon ko phone karata tha
 There is no system of job process in the media, so it has to be done
 lekin aapako ek baat samajni hogi
 i am not authorized to talk about jobs and internships
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki main news room ke dhaanche kaa hissaa nahin hum
 Those who do this work better understand someone's role and need
 training karaane kaa gun unamem behatar hota he, isliye main kabhi bhi internship or naukari ke maamle main 'haa' main jawaab nahin detaa, kyonki main 'haa' nahin kar saktaa
 What is the fourth thing to do? i would like all of you to have a chance to work
 maine kisi se nahin kaha ki aapke saath rahakar sikh luungaa
 i really think this is an excuse
 ham log itane kam vaqt main jite hai ki vaaqai kisi se baat karne kaa vaqt nahin hota, sikhaanaa to dur kii baat he
 Why want to cheat yourself? What you will do, you have to decide
 main jo bhi karata hum, vah sara kaa sara public main hota he
 There is no hidden secret
 motaa-moti aapako pataa hi hota he ki ek patrkaar banane ke liye kya karnaa hota he
 Yet the answer is very simple
 rose 2,000 shabd likhen or jaisaa ki patrkaar prakaash ke re kehete hai ki rose 100 pej kisi kitaab kaa padhein
 i post what i read myself
 to alag se meri koi sikret reeding list nahin he
 Many people write about books
 yah bhi koi gupt soochna nahin he
 Go anywhere, be on the lookout for writing something
 logon se baat karen or research karen
 You keep writing likhte-likhte ho jayega
 Unless there is a job, write on social media
 likhnaa to padegaa
 This is a daily practice
 aap ek din main kuch nahin hote
 And what is happening, i do not understand
 ek jatke main naukari chali jaati he or log bhul jate hai
 That's why journalists first become for themselves
 jaanane kii yatra par eemaandaaree se nikal padie, sab acha hoga
 If you beat a stick, you will be deceived
 kul milakar, khud ko banane ke liye kisi ek factory kii talash na karen
 Spread yourself in different grounds
 asli baat aap logon ko mauqaa milane kii he
 They are very few
 jahaan mil bhi jaae or vahaan patrakarita na hoti ho, to main kya kar saktaa hum
 Said and wrote so much
 vah bhi naukari main rahete hue bolaa or apane program main bhi bolaa
 i can pray for you all
 phir is line ko chhod den
 If you can not leave, then keep preparing
 vah subah kabhi to aegi
 i also learn from many people
 aap bhi kai logon se seekhen
 Befriend the young research scholar who understands new topics
 unke saamne vinamr rahen or puuchhen
 Look for such great students
 main apane se aadhi umr ke logon se zyaada dosti rakhata hum
 i learn from them like a student
 unhen koi dikkat nahin aati he
 Like i used to stay away from business news
 do saal bijnes ke akhbaaron ko padhaa
 He also understood his cleverness
 unheen kii soochnaaon ko samajhnaa shuru kiya
 Translated what was understood in Hindi and posted it on Facebook page
 yah isliye ki agar aap patrkaar hai, to jo bhi jaanate hai (of ricard kii sharton kaa aadar karte hue), use saajha karen
 Read the responses kai log aage aakar kamiyaan bhi bataa dete hai
 i do not have any herbs

 LG has now become the entry of Lieutenant Governor in the ongoing controversy over onion in Delhi
 centre kii agencinaphed ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ko patralikhakar dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar kii shikaayat kii he
 The issue between the Kejriwal government and LG, already standing face to face over administrative rights in Delhi, can create a new controversy
 nafed kaa dilli sarkaar par aropanaphed ne apane patr main likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar sasta pyaaj khareednaa hi nahin chaahati jabakidilli ke logon ko sasta pyaaj uplabdh karaneke liye nafed taiyaar he
 NAFED has said in its letter that it has 2500 metric tonnes of onion in Delhi's quota
 jo ki vah bazaar bhav se sasta uplabdh karaane ko taiyaar he
 Disputes over the conditions: Before this, the Delhi government was engulfed in controversies with its own letter
 do din pehle hi dilli sarkaar ke khaadya or aapurti mantri aseem khan ne ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main taal thonk kar kaha ki dilli sarkaar nafed se pyaaj lene ko taiyaar he, chaahe wo 19 rupye kilo den, 20 rupye kilo den yaa 25 rupye kilo den
 Because the government's objective is to provide cheap onions to Delhi, but on Friday morning, the Delhi government sent a letter to NAFED stating that the Delhi government wishes to buy interest from NAFED but it has two conditions
 dilli sarkaar kii do shartenpahali shart ye ki pyaaj kii keemat 19 rupye hi honi chahie usase zyada nahin or is 19 rupye main bhandaaran nuksaan jise storage los kehete hai or parivahan yani transportesan kaa kharch bhi shaamil he or duusari ye ki pyaaj kii delivery bhi sarkaar ko dilli ke anand vihaar main chahie, na ki wo nasik se pyaaj legi
 This is the cleanliness and proposal of NAFED
 Now the statement of NAFED is that the Delhi government is clearly working to pull the case
 nafed ke diarector ashok thakur ne bataaya- 'centre nepief yani price stabiligeshan fund ke tahatadilli ke cote main 2500 metric ton pyaaj alag rakhwai he
 We have been writing a letter to the Delhi government since April saying that the Delhi government should buy onion at the same price at which the onion has been taken from the farmers, the onion will be received from Nashik because the NAFED storage is there
 saath hi dilli sarkaar apana ek afasar bhi nasik bheje jo tamaam aupchaariktaayen puri kare
 AAP spokesperson Ashutosh alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party, which came to the rescue of its government, is making even more childish arguments
 party ke pravaktaa ashutosh aarope lagaate hai ki nafed dilli ko gumraah kar rahi he
 Neither are they willing to believe that Nafed wrote letters to the Delhi government from April to June and neither is willing to believe that Nafed was ready to give cheap onions to the Delhi government
 maje kii baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar yaa phir aam aadmi party netaaon ke paas bachaav main sirf aarope hai, koi saboot nahin
 According to Nafed director Ashok Thakur, the whole matter is not about buying or selling cheap onions
 maamla us 2500 metric ton ke pyaaj ke stock ko uthaane kaa he jo centre sarkaar ne dilli ke naam par surakshit rakhaa he
 The role of NAFED is merely that of an intermediary
